1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,632
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday August 30th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:12,673 --> 00:00:20,380
Speaker 1: We bring you the secret panel from Otacon 2006 meaning the webcomics roundtable that we've recorded in the Renaissance Hotel on Saturday night.

3
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:22,716
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:24,181 --> 00:00:28,755
Speaker 1: So there's something I gotta get off of my chest things that are boobs hurt in this community.

5
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:30,279
Speaker 1: more so now is that?

6
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,700
Speaker 3: How long are we gonna carry on with this inside joke that is impossible to share with the world?

7
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:42,011
Speaker 1: Because it may someday be shared with the world Let's try to make some progress in that area actually though.

8
00:00:42,092 --> 00:00:43,596
Speaker 1: I do have something I get off my chest.

9
00:00:43,657 --> 00:00:55,832
Speaker 1: I would like to say that Protein supplements and protein bars are perhaps the vilest Constructions known to man, that's why I don't eat them good.

10
00:00:56,073 --> 00:00:58,540
Speaker 1: fucking God do those things not taste good?

11
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:00,932
Speaker 3: Well, I mean what tastes good in the world?

12
00:01:00,973 --> 00:01:02,259
Speaker 3: ready sugar.

13
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:05,548
Speaker 1: There's ice all right and fat.

14
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:06,932
Speaker 3: that's what tastes good.

15
00:01:07,313 --> 00:01:08,436
Speaker 3: protein does not taste good.

16
00:01:08,496 --> 00:01:09,680
Speaker 3: protein doesn't taste like anything.

17
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,985
Speaker 1: No protein can taste good.

18
00:01:11,286 --> 00:01:11,668
Speaker 1: protein.

19
00:01:11,688 --> 00:01:14,559
Speaker 1: you realize Scott is a very broad category of things.

20
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:20,140
Speaker 3: Yeah, but you know the proteins are generally a collection of amino acids.

21
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,598
Speaker 1: I've got some of the best tasting meats are extremely lean and have very little fat in them at all.

22
00:01:25,662 --> 00:01:26,485
Speaker 3: Yeah, but without.

23
00:01:26,505 --> 00:01:27,127
Speaker 1: so what do you think?

24
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:28,311
Speaker 3: without any fat the me?

25
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:30,699
Speaker 1: so uh so what do you think is in those meats?

26
00:01:32,785 --> 00:01:34,236
Speaker 1: Meat okay, and what does meat made out of?

27
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:35,722
Speaker 0: Meat?

28
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:39,864
Speaker 1: yes, yes meat is made out of protein Among other things.

29
00:01:40,124 --> 00:01:43,433
Speaker 3: yeah, then how come they don't make a meat bar that tastes good.

30
00:01:44,015 --> 00:01:44,777
Speaker 1: You know what they do.

31
00:01:44,837 --> 00:01:45,479
Speaker 1: It's called jerky.

32
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:49,609
Speaker 3: Haha, then why are you eating a nasty ass protein bar?

33
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,116
Speaker 1: because I needed more protein.

34
00:01:52,156 --> 00:01:53,760
Speaker 1: see the thing is more jerky.

35
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:54,583
Speaker 1: See that.

36
00:01:54,623 --> 00:02:07,399
Speaker 1: the thing is just that my diet for most of my life has not been Inconducive to any sort of Non-aerobic exercise because I tend to eat a lot of carbohydrates and very little else.

37
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,579
Speaker 3: Well, that's what the food pyramid says to eat.

38
00:02:10,848 --> 00:02:19,719
Speaker 1: Yeah Which means that I've been my scrawny self for a long time and now I need a little bit of protein because I'm trying to Lift a few weights, but do you want to be like a muscle man?

39
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,250
Speaker 1: No I just want to stay in shape for Basically my entire body is in shape as in.

40
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:29,087
Speaker 1: no just my legs are in shape and the rest of my body was kind of weak You know running and biking and all that.

41
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:29,649
Speaker 3: so what do you?

42
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:35,914
Speaker 1: so let's I always feel funny because I got my tiny little like 10-pound freeways, and then there's Pete who could probably just bench-press me.

43
00:02:35,934 --> 00:02:37,480
Speaker 3: all right, so let's say you're not weak anymore.

44
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:38,164
Speaker 3: What do you?

45
00:02:38,184 --> 00:02:40,840
Speaker 3: what are you gonna do with your newfound strength powers?

46
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,245
Speaker 3: You're gonna go become spider-man.

47
00:02:43,426 --> 00:02:46,919
Speaker 1: You know how much time I'll save by opening doors more quickly?

48
00:02:48,681 --> 00:02:51,846
Speaker 3: okay, that's Less time than you spent lifting weights.

49
00:02:52,528 --> 00:02:53,591
Speaker 1: I believe I don't.

50
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:59,297
Speaker 1: this is another inside joke, but I'll open the hell out-of-doors That's for sure.

51
00:03:01,942 --> 00:03:06,070
Speaker 1: The only thing I wanted to say is that protein bars and protein supplements taste like assholes.

52
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:20,439
Speaker 3: It is a general rule of thumb that 90% of foods that say they are nutritional or advertise themselves to being nutritional taste like ass or have no flavor at all and In the book of Scott that means they should not be eaten.

53
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:30,600
Speaker 1: but anyway We're gonna go real light on the news and the things the day today because we are finally going to air the Secret panel that we ran at Otacon 2006.

54
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,904
Speaker 3: you

55
00:03:31,924 --> 00:03:47,760
Speaker 1: see we generally if you listen to our coverage of Otacon or fast karate for the gentleman's coverage of Otacon or anime world orders coverage of Otacon You might have gotten the impression that many of us did not particularly care for the vast majority of the panels that happened at Otacon?

56
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,649
Speaker 3: Yeah, of course again, you can't blame Otacon for that.

57
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,191
Speaker 1: Oh, not at all.

58
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:55,281
Speaker 3: Well, you can blame them a tiny bit for not Caring.

59
00:03:55,301 --> 00:04:01,427
Speaker 1: Otacon's panels despite their problems were not as bad as the panels at lesser cons We attended.

60
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:02,720
Speaker 3: that is definitely true.

61
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, we you can listen to our old con reports to get all that.

62
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:17,349
Speaker 3: but the point is that in general at pretty much every anime convention that we know of that we've been to and many of our Accomplices have been to Panels are like accomplices.

63
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:17,851
Speaker 1: I like that.

64
00:04:17,952 --> 00:04:20,082
Speaker 1: Although you should have said maybe henchmen cohorts I don't know.

65
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:23,315
Speaker 3: panels are sucking lately in general overall.

66
00:04:23,335 --> 00:04:24,500
Speaker 3: There are still good panels.

67
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:28,419
Speaker 3: There is still absolutely terrible panels, but the average is going down.

68
00:04:29,461 --> 00:04:33,076
Speaker 1: So what we did is well actually what I did because Scott actually was out.

69
00:04:33,136 --> 00:04:34,160
Speaker 1: I think you were watching a terrible.

70
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,173
Speaker 3: I was watching some terrible ass movies.

71
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:36,294
Speaker 1: Yeah.

72
00:04:36,314 --> 00:04:37,260
Speaker 1: Well Scott was doing that.

73
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:44,337
Speaker 1: I was getting myself nice and drunk and then all the webcomic artists I know and the webcomic artist friends of the webcomic artists.

74
00:04:44,397 --> 00:04:46,547
Speaker 1: I know Ended up in our hotel room.

75
00:04:46,929 --> 00:04:49,500
Speaker 1: So I decided alright, I'm gonna do that thing.

76
00:04:49,582 --> 00:04:57,945
Speaker 1: I said I do that I didn't think I'd actually do and Actually sit them all down with microphones and kind of interview all of them and it turned into what I think is a pretty good Panel,

77
00:04:58,312 --> 00:05:02,973
Speaker 3: I think That the had the advantage of alcohol which normal panels do not have.

78
00:05:03,174 --> 00:05:07,000
Speaker 3: I think alcohol while I don't drink It would make every panel more interesting.

79
00:05:07,221 --> 00:05:11,616
Speaker 1: See the thing is you really couldn't tell that anyone had been drinking.

80
00:05:11,756 --> 00:05:16,699
Speaker 1: if you listen to it though I have not listened to all of it and I will say that Conrad is like that.

81
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,569
Speaker 1: Anyway, regardless of the amount of alcohol in him.

82
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:20,813
Speaker 3: I guess that's absolutely true.

83
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,944
Speaker 3: I Haven't listened to.

84
00:05:23,964 --> 00:05:26,395
Speaker 3: I listen to the end because I showed up for the end of it.

85
00:05:26,616 --> 00:05:27,359
Speaker 3: Yep, but that's it.

86
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:33,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, as opposed to the roundtable you help me run where you kind of just sabotage the whole thing.

87
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,286
Speaker 3: I was mad tired.

88
00:05:34,326 --> 00:05:35,713
Speaker 3: I wasn't sabotaging on purpose.

89
00:05:35,754 --> 00:05:36,880
Speaker 3: I was trying to do good.

90
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,840
Speaker 1: Well, the funny thing is in this one that we're gonna play.

91
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:46,640
Speaker 1: You know on this episode you can really hear My voice pretty much in the final throes of it dying because my voice is squeaking all over the place.

92
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,717
Speaker 1: And as you all know, we both lost our voices on Sunday.

93
00:05:49,737 --> 00:05:52,535
Speaker 1: Yeah Okay, I blame podcasting.

94
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:55,950
Speaker 1: Oh So anyway to keep it brief in the news.

95
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,460
Speaker 1: the anime manga comics web comics news.

96
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:00,907
Speaker 1: My news is very brief very to the point.

97
00:06:01,488 --> 00:06:05,339
Speaker 1: death note volume 7 came out in English.

98
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,589
Speaker 3: now It's been out in Japanese for a long time.

99
00:06:08,011 --> 00:06:09,499
Speaker 1: This would not normally be news.

100
00:06:09,761 --> 00:06:22,600
Speaker 1: However, for those of you who have read it You will know why I'm bringing this up as news and for those of you who haven't I will simply say that when you read Death note 7 be prepared to read the whole thing in one go and be prepared.

101
00:06:23,521 --> 00:06:27,880
Speaker 3: Death note 7 is perhaps the most important and best volume of death note.

102
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,314
Speaker 3: well, it contains the most important and best chapters of death note.

103
00:06:31,374 --> 00:06:34,845
Speaker 3: in my opinion it also begins the turning point.

104
00:06:35,226 --> 00:06:46,319
Speaker 3: that sort of starts phase 2 where the manga changes gears from being one thing to being another thing and I'll reserve my opinions of phase 2 for another time.

105
00:06:47,163 --> 00:06:52,724
Speaker 3: But let it be known that there are two moments in the manga that are basically Tremendously important.

106
00:06:53,185 --> 00:06:56,595
Speaker 1: if you thought some of that stuff with penber early on was a big deal.

107
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,480
Speaker 1: You haven't seen anything.

108
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,920
Speaker 3: Yes, and both of these moments receive double dual page spreads.

109
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:15,235
Speaker 3: The first moment should be very early on in the ma in volume 7 and the second moment should be much later on in volume 7. now the first one is my favorite and the second one is the most important.

110
00:07:15,676 --> 00:07:26,716
Speaker 1: see the second one was a Moment when I realized that there was a character in this manga that I had been a little Sympathetic to and I kind of liked and I didn't like that character anymore.

111
00:07:26,877 --> 00:07:35,167
Speaker 3: after that point all Yeah, the first part was when I realized that You know that my favorite one cuz.

112
00:07:35,207 --> 00:07:38,317
Speaker 1: well true that part too because then you realize oh I didn't.

113
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:55,193
Speaker 3: oh It was like OMG OMG doo-doo-doo double page spread and then the next page it's like oh Yeah, you can tell we I've been wanting to talk about this since what?

114
00:07:55,333 --> 00:08:02,113
Speaker 1: over a year ago when we read this yeah And it's finally out in English meaning sometime in the near future.

115
00:08:02,194 --> 00:08:03,799
Speaker 1: We are going to do a show on death note.

116
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,420
Speaker 3: We will do a show on the first half of death note with spoilers spoilers.

117
00:08:08,841 --> 00:08:13,797
Speaker 1: I got some things that I got to get off of my chest things that are hurting this community more.

118
00:08:13,878 --> 00:08:22,169
Speaker 3: So now Okay speaking of manga and other comics I don't know how long this has been on the internet.

119
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:40,573
Speaker 3: Oh, it's only been on the internet since August 18 2006. cool this is a list of the 2005 so last year comics and graphic novel bestsellers from one to a hundred and Number one is full metal alchemist volume one.

120
00:08:40,592 --> 00:08:44,086
Speaker 1: This is in English, by the way You're not gonna read the whole freaking.

121
00:08:44,187 --> 00:08:48,520
Speaker 3: Oh, I'm not but basically it's Naruto Naruto Naruto Sin City Star Wars.

122
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:58,183
Speaker 3: And then the whole rest of the list is Naruto Sin City fruit basket Star Wars Kenshin Dn angel inu yasha And death note.

123
00:08:58,283 --> 00:09:03,940
Speaker 1: now, of course the ultimate question here is how many underwear pervert aka superhero comics?

124
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,495
Speaker 3: Yeah, because I mean look this is the hundred best-selling graphic novels and comics in the u.s.

125
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:18,884
Speaker 3: In the year of 2005 and the top of it is completely dominated by manga except for Sin City and Star Wars and There is some scattered.

126
00:09:18,944 --> 00:09:26,550
Speaker 3: Calvin and Hobbes is about and I think one far side and maybe a peanut now Way at the bottom way at the bottom.

127
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:27,735
Speaker 3: number 99 is our crumb.

128
00:09:29,261 --> 00:09:34,755
Speaker 3: Okay, and there's some Calvin and Hobbes down there, but number 66 is the first.

129
00:09:34,796 --> 00:09:38,559
Speaker 3: so there are 65 manga and other stuff.

130
00:09:39,342 --> 00:09:46,717
Speaker 3: Number 66 is Batman hush volume 2 the best-selling underwear pervert comic or graphic novel of the year.

131
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:56,098
Speaker 3: number 48 was Attack of the deranged mutant killer monster show goons that sold better than every single underwear.

132
00:09:56,138 --> 00:10:01,883
Speaker 3: pervert 63 was Warcraft the Sunwell trilogy 1.

133
00:10:01,883 --> 00:10:04,131
Speaker 3: God God from Tokyo pop.

134
00:10:04,472 --> 00:10:06,960
Speaker 3: it sold better than every underwear pervert.

135
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,850
Speaker 3: What yugioh number one sold better than every underwear pervert?

136
00:10:13,452 --> 00:10:16,058
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know mega Tokyo volume 3.

137
00:10:16,058 --> 00:10:24,380
Speaker 3: Oh Outsold every single underwear pervert except that single Batman beat it by two spots on the list.

138
00:10:24,964 --> 00:10:25,891
Speaker 1: you know what this means?

139
00:10:25,931 --> 00:10:36,009
Speaker 1: it means that the Not the comic industry in regards to underwear perverts aka superheroes or super - heroes Isn't doing so well.

140
00:10:36,493 --> 00:10:37,358
Speaker 1: No, no.

141
00:10:39,063 --> 00:10:52,740
Speaker 1: And I think the way to sum it up is that when we went to free comic book day to get our free comic books The proprietor of the comic book shop We went to seem somewhat angry that we were not willing to purchase his underwear pervert comics that we just wanted our free.

142
00:10:52,981 --> 00:10:54,444
Speaker 3: No, here's the best thing ready.

143
00:10:54,725 --> 00:11:05,914
Speaker 3: The second underwear pervert on the list is Batman hush volume 1 at number 76. the third Underwear pervert is Batman Dark Knight Returns, which is actually really good.

144
00:11:05,934 --> 00:11:07,600
Speaker 3: It's Batman written by the Sin City guy.

145
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:09,168
Speaker 3: I have it and it's damn good.

146
00:11:09,188 --> 00:11:18,261
Speaker 3: You should read it, but it's number 85. and The only other underwear pervert on the entire list is 89 Watchmen Watchmen.

147
00:11:18,422 --> 00:11:30,927
Speaker 3: perhaps the greatest underwear pervert comic ever was outsold by mega Tokyo volume 3 Warcraft something volume 1 and A whole shit ton of manga.

148
00:11:31,469 --> 00:11:40,536
Speaker 1: I hate to say it, but it makes me really happy partly because I really don't like underwear pervert comics in general and I'm kind of glad that I'm not alone in this sentiment.

149
00:11:40,857 --> 00:11:46,800
Speaker 1: and too though It makes me a little sad that Watchmen really needs to be widely read because Watchmen is excellent.

150
00:11:47,282 --> 00:12:01,080
Speaker 3: Yeah, the general problem I have is that you know There's a whole genre of comics that involve underwear perverts and as in any genre Some of them are damn good like Watchmen and Batman Dark Knight Returns.

151
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,184
Speaker 1: I don't think the word some.

152
00:12:02,285 --> 00:12:04,353
Speaker 1: I think the word one would suffice.

153
00:12:04,493 --> 00:12:05,417
Speaker 3: No, there are a few.

154
00:12:05,437 --> 00:12:06,220
Speaker 1: Oh three.

155
00:12:06,882 --> 00:12:12,421
Speaker 3: There are more than three but not many percentage wise less than 1%.

156
00:12:12,421 --> 00:12:16,860
Speaker 3: Yet the comics they have stores stores dead.

157
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:30,540
Speaker 3: They have an entire distribution company dedicated to one genre in one medium and in the United States There is an entire medium that is dominated by one genre and a better selling.

158
00:12:31,553 --> 00:12:33,664
Speaker 3: Uh Genre in the medium.

159
00:12:33,764 --> 00:12:39,884
Speaker 3: I guess manga is not a genre, but it's a. it's a subset of a medium of you know graphic Whatever.

160
00:12:39,905 --> 00:12:39,985
Speaker 3: Yeah.

161
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:43,669
Speaker 3: Yeah is Kicking its ass yet.

162
00:12:44,252 --> 00:12:45,900
Speaker 3: The market won't change.

163
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:52,200
Speaker 3: They're still dominating the comic book store with superheroes if they were cat if they were smart at all.

164
00:12:52,902 --> 00:12:53,824
Speaker 3: Look at these numbers.

165
00:12:54,546 --> 00:12:59,500
Speaker 3: if you were going by what sells you wouldn't you would cancel every freaking superhero book.

166
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:12,744
Speaker 1: Well that leads right into the things of the day because God's thing of the day is quite Underwear pervert II.

167
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:15,373
Speaker 3: Yeah, you know, it sure does piss me off.

168
00:13:15,413 --> 00:13:19,748
Speaker 3: Those combo companies do not make Economically wise decisions.

169
00:13:19,828 --> 00:13:22,080
Speaker 3: that would benefit my entertainment anyway.

170
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:30,300
Speaker 3: Yeah, but here's a good example of what's wrong with underwear pervert comics and why they're not so great.

171
00:13:31,222 --> 00:13:33,488
Speaker 3: This guy did a pretty cool thing on his blog.

172
00:13:33,528 --> 00:13:35,855
Speaker 3: he took Watchmen a great comic.

173
00:13:35,895 --> 00:13:42,154
Speaker 3: we just talked about it two seconds ago and He redid the cover and four pages of Watchmen.

174
00:13:42,234 --> 00:14:00,000
Speaker 3: He redid all the text in The style of writing that is known to be fit Stan Lee with you know random bolding of words and Crazy made-up words and that this precisely what I hate about underwear pervert comics.

175
00:14:00,301 --> 00:14:08,442
Speaker 3: yep, so he takes a great underwear pervert comic that doesn't have the things that are hated and he adds the hated things and It just.

176
00:14:09,369 --> 00:14:16,738
Speaker 3: it really just shows you Like if you didn't if you don't notice it reading a normal underwear pervert comic you look at this and you go.

177
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,953
Speaker 3: Oh That's why they're stupid.

178
00:14:19,336 --> 00:14:19,740
Speaker 3: look at that.

179
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:26,440
Speaker 1: You know the bowling wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't that they bolded random words instead of useful words or words that made sense.

180
00:14:26,962 --> 00:14:38,059
Speaker 3: But this just shows how they took the standard of what superhero comics are took it and merged it with the greatest pinnacle of superhero comics and it turns to crap.

181
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,741
Speaker 3: and It's just.

182
00:14:39,842 --> 00:14:41,688
Speaker 3: the concept is just so perfect.

183
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:42,972
Speaker 3: It's golden you.

184
00:14:43,012 --> 00:14:44,095
Speaker 3: I got you got to look at it.

185
00:14:44,637 --> 00:14:51,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's especially Special to me after you might have heard my rant on another podcast a while ago about the balding.

186
00:14:52,321 --> 00:15:03,040
Speaker 1: Yep, because I was unable to finish reading a comic recently because the balding just bothered me so much I couldn't force myself to read and that was just the balding let alone the writing style and other.

187
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't even get to the plot or the characters of the writing or the art or anything.

188
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:09,865
Speaker 1: The balding alone stopped me.

189
00:15:10,447 --> 00:15:11,630
Speaker 1: All right, you know what.

190
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:14,940
Speaker 1: now I'm gonna actually pass on having a thing of the day today.

191
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,163
Speaker 3: Well, you suck cuz.

192
00:15:16,244 --> 00:15:32,520
Speaker 1: I didn't have anything particularly relevant to anime manga comics web comics and I don't want to Start another trend of having super super long episodes because we I think we tried to wean ourselves off of that just before Otacon Mmm, plus I have to do a whole bunch of editing to make this thing listenable before it goes up.

193
00:15:32,701 --> 00:15:36,918
Speaker 3: The problem is it's hard not to make a long episode when we're playing a record pre-recorded bit.

194
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,399
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, I hope you all enjoy it.

195
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,980
Speaker 1: They talk about a wide variety of topics and they introduce themselves, so I won't bother reintroducing them before.

196
00:15:45,141 --> 00:15:46,816
Speaker 3: Yeah, I'm gonna have to download this and listen to it.

197
00:15:48,165 --> 00:15:58,360
Speaker 1: So we're here at Otacon 2006 with a variety of slightly drunk to completely drunk web comic artist web comic aficionados anime fans general ne'er-do-wells and Conrad.

198
00:16:00,965 --> 00:16:05,019
Speaker 1: So, I guess everyone who's here could introduce themselves so we can at least tell whose voice is whose.

199
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,500
Speaker 1: I am Of course rim your favorite host of geek nights.

200
00:16:08,387 --> 00:16:09,274
Speaker 0: My name is Brian Carroll.

201
00:16:09,314 --> 00:16:10,020
Speaker 0: I do instant classic.

202
00:16:11,102 --> 00:16:12,247
Speaker 0: My name is Mookie.

203
00:16:12,508 --> 00:16:15,200
Speaker 2: I am the writer and artist of a Dominic Deegan Oracle for hire.

204
00:16:16,988 --> 00:16:19,446
Speaker 7: I am my I'm I do.

205
00:16:19,628 --> 00:16:21,200
Speaker 7: I do a comic called fallen.

206
00:16:22,403 --> 00:16:23,149
Speaker 1: Hi, I'm cat.

207
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,319
Speaker 1: I actually do nothing.

208
00:16:25,561 --> 00:16:26,565
Speaker 6: My name is Connor krailing.

209
00:16:26,605 --> 00:16:32,198
Speaker 6: I have no discernible skills or talents, but I was invited here tonight to talk to you about things Good things.

210
00:16:33,264 --> 00:16:39,812
Speaker 4: My name is Laram Lancaster, and I used to take part in committee But now I just simply feature in it.

211
00:16:40,254 --> 00:16:47,280
Speaker 1: So we're not doing anything particularly Big here, but I guess I'd like to get impressions of Otacon the artist Ally the con in general.

212
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,468
Speaker 1: I mean some of you go to more cons than others.

213
00:16:49,528 --> 00:16:54,151
Speaker 1: So I guess I won't direct this to anyone in particular first, but How was Otacon?

214
00:16:54,171 --> 00:16:54,717
Speaker 1: Why are you here?

215
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:05,008
Speaker 2: well Otacon is the biggest convention of the year for a lot of us here on the East Coast and speaking personally And someone who makes a living off of his webcomic.

216
00:17:05,048 --> 00:17:08,039
Speaker 2: This is where most of my income usually comes in.

217
00:17:08,703 --> 00:17:20,148
Speaker 2: So as this as in every year I have a fabulous time because most of the people who don't go to any convention Most people who go to only one convention a year come to this one.

218
00:17:20,651 --> 00:17:23,116
Speaker 2: You just meet everybody whether you want to or not.

219
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:25,403
Speaker 0: I Agree with that.

220
00:17:25,604 --> 00:17:26,608
Speaker 0: It's also my biggest convention.

221
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:34,771
Speaker 0: I do about two or three a year and Although I don't usually have that much of a big representation here I usually use it to meet up with my friends webcomic friends people.

222
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:42,039
Speaker 0: I only see about two or three times a year themselves We talk fascism communism the whole nine yards food.

223
00:17:43,303 --> 00:17:47,680
Speaker 1: This is actually my third con and I still don't know why I go but I'm here and it's a good time.

224
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:50,318
Speaker 1: I see people and I do things.

225
00:17:52,025 --> 00:17:54,294
Speaker 1: So most of you spend your time in the artist alley.

226
00:17:54,334 --> 00:17:55,760
Speaker 1: I take it at the convention, that's true.

227
00:17:57,146 --> 00:17:57,920
Speaker 1: Now, how is that?

228
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:05,599
Speaker 1: I mean the artist alley tends to be a very eclectic collection of artists of all different stripes ranging from complete fan artists to totally original works.

229
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:11,340
Speaker 1: What do you guys do in the artist alley aside from obviously selling art, I mean do you promote yourselves?

230
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,506
Speaker 1: Do you just socialize?

231
00:18:12,566 --> 00:18:13,351
Speaker 1: is it networking?

232
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:14,316
Speaker 1: What is the artist alley?

233
00:18:14,356 --> 00:18:14,839
Speaker 1: Why are you there?

234
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,373
Speaker 2: The artist alley is so fascinating because it is so many different things.

235
00:18:19,634 --> 00:18:27,706
Speaker 2: once it is all those things people promoting themselves original artwork fan artwork and networking and you don't really have to do.

236
00:18:27,726 --> 00:18:28,228
Speaker 2: you don't really.

237
00:18:28,268 --> 00:18:34,784
Speaker 2: you don't really have to really go out of your way to do any of the more socialist parts of it because Fascinatingly enough.

238
00:18:35,126 --> 00:18:40,530
Speaker 2: It always seems just come to you because the artist alley By nature is just so diverse.

239
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:45,830
Speaker 0: I think this is actually interesting because Me and Mookie earned different sides of the coin with artists alley.

240
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:52,050
Speaker 0: people will go to artist alley seeking out Mookie Whereas I am looking for promotion myself.

241
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:55,845
Speaker 0: So whereas Mookie, I don't think you're really Promoting yourself.

242
00:18:55,865 --> 00:18:56,790
Speaker 0: You're already promoted.

243
00:18:57,374 --> 00:19:03,831
Speaker 0: You're more there for the Public Yeah, and I'm there for the promotion.

244
00:19:03,912 --> 00:19:05,560
Speaker 0: so I think that's interesting on two sides.

245
00:19:06,465 --> 00:19:10,580
Speaker 1: So in terms of self-promotion Does it ever feel awkward trying to promote yourself?

246
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:16,864
Speaker 1: I mean, there's a fine line between selling something you do and you know be coming off as a person who's trying to sell something You do.

247
00:19:16,884 --> 00:19:18,440
Speaker 1: do you walk that fine line?

248
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,655
Speaker 1: Do you ever like you're giving us feel to someone and you just feel awkward while you're doing it?

249
00:19:22,756 --> 00:19:23,779
Speaker 1: or you wonder if maybe you?

250
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,657
Speaker 1: Overstepped a line or something?

251
00:19:26,783 --> 00:19:37,012
Speaker 0: Well in terms of the actual line I'll just answer It's I'm kind of like it's not really like a carnival where you know I'm on the dunking booth shouting at people to go hit me down.

252
00:19:37,313 --> 00:19:39,060
Speaker 0: Hand me three dollars and throw a ball at my target.

253
00:19:39,524 --> 00:19:45,738
Speaker 0: it's um, I Guess the line is crossed between if you seek them out or if they seek you out like my my display.

254
00:19:45,778 --> 00:19:47,646
Speaker 0: this year I spent a long time on it.

255
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:52,436
Speaker 0: So be I was bringing people to it and Therefore I can promote myself that way.

256
00:19:54,042 --> 00:19:56,434
Speaker 2: There I mean some people I think are a little too aggressive.

257
00:19:56,956 --> 00:20:03,938
Speaker 2: in the artist Sally I mean my first year ever at Otacon I was next to a guy Who wasn't doing so?

258
00:20:03,978 --> 00:20:04,140
Speaker 2: well?

259
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:14,279
Speaker 2: so he would literally yell at people who were walking across walking even remotely near his table and Saying you come here you come here and they would drink they would.

260
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:19,079
Speaker 2: Because a lot of geeks are very shy and when someone's yelling them to do something, they'll probably do it.

261
00:20:19,982 --> 00:20:21,192
Speaker 2: So you had them flyers.

262
00:20:21,414 --> 00:20:22,060
Speaker 1: do any of you ever go?

263
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,500
Speaker 1: I mean, this is obviously an anime convention which tend to be very broad-based.

264
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,283
Speaker 1: Do you ever work at?

265
00:20:26,744 --> 00:20:31,179
Speaker 1: art might not just miss work, but do other convention maybe comic centered conventions or other?

266
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,247
Speaker 1: Types of conventions.

267
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:34,655
Speaker 1: Are there any different from anime conventions?

268
00:20:34,675 --> 00:20:35,360
Speaker 1: You even go to them?

269
00:20:36,482 --> 00:20:39,219
Speaker 2: I go to I I go to one every year.

270
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:45,280
Speaker 2: That's more of a sci-fi more sci-fi fantasy and almost Ren fair centered icon on Long Island.

271
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:55,647
Speaker 2: The the sci-fi fans are much different much different than the anime fans there are much more Selective in what they spend their money on.

272
00:20:55,707 --> 00:20:58,818
Speaker 2: they're a lot less willing to show you how enthusiastic they are.

273
00:20:59,621 --> 00:21:02,052
Speaker 2: A lot of few of them like I feel like they some of them.

274
00:21:02,093 --> 00:21:03,640
Speaker 2: they can look down their nose at you.

275
00:21:05,383 --> 00:21:07,020
Speaker 2: But the anime fans are starting to creep in.

276
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:09,842
Speaker 2: a Lot of them start.

277
00:21:10,244 --> 00:21:25,431
Speaker 2: anime fans are starting to creep into that convention too and whereas anime fans are tend to be very Enthusiastic and open and almost accepting of new things the older school sci-fi fans Are more pushing them away, and I don't I think they should be.

278
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,936
Speaker 2: I think they should be more accepting.

279
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:32,180
Speaker 2: another convention I went to was Wizard World Boston Which I failed at miserably.

280
00:21:33,383 --> 00:21:44,723
Speaker 2: Wizard World Boston had a bunch of comic fans And it was so strange because there was one guy dressed up the entire weekend as the Green Lantern and these people at this Convention flipped

281
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:45,606
Speaker 1: wait so

282
00:21:45,726 --> 00:21:47,050
Speaker 2: one guy in costume,

283
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:50,680
Speaker 1: so he was dressed up as the Green Lantern for all three days.

284
00:21:51,406 --> 00:21:52,740
Speaker 2: No one day, okay, okay?

285
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,399
Speaker 2: One guy just showed up one day and drew an immense crowd because everyone's making a huge deal.

286
00:21:58,439 --> 00:22:01,540
Speaker 2: look There's somebody in costume at an anime convention.

287
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:03,918
Speaker 1: How often do you see that?

288
00:22:06,584 --> 00:22:08,673
Speaker 1: No, I went to Philly Wizard World.

289
00:22:08,733 --> 00:22:11,965
Speaker 1: as opposed to a Philly Wizard World I emphasize the wrong syllables there.

290
00:22:11,985 --> 00:22:16,959
Speaker 1: Philly Wizard World was a scary convention that we devoted a great deal of coverage to.

291
00:22:19,285 --> 00:22:20,760
Speaker 2: I went to Wizard World Boston.

292
00:22:21,602 --> 00:22:23,718
Speaker 1: They're basically the same thing as far as I can tell.

293
00:22:23,738 --> 00:22:32,079
Speaker 1: yeah just different locations and we ran into the situation where anime cons you know I pull out a microphone I try to interview someone and The ten fangirls around will run over in.

294
00:22:32,362 --> 00:22:33,195
Speaker 1: Oh interview me next year.

295
00:22:33,256 --> 00:22:33,520
Speaker 1: oh my god.

296
00:22:35,004 --> 00:22:38,827
Speaker 1: At Philly Wizard World I Couldn't get anyone to interview with me.

297
00:22:39,008 --> 00:22:48,059
Speaker 1: I'd like even without the microphones in my pocket I'm just some dude at the con and I walk up and I try to ask someone like like hey How you doing, and they just look at me with this look of who are you and why are you talking to me?

298
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,782
Speaker 2: Very different crowd.

299
00:22:49,983 --> 00:22:56,300
Speaker 2: I prefer the anime crowds tenfold to the Comic Con so not Comic Con comic book convention crowds.

300
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:00,331
Speaker 1: So How is the social atmosphere in the artist alley?

301
00:23:00,351 --> 00:23:01,880
Speaker 1: I mean obviously you all I?

302
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:09,620
Speaker 1: Noticed that people who come for the artist alley tend to stay in the artist alley most of the con and yet Enjoy themselves immensely and I all the best stories from conventions.

303
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,979
Speaker 1: I hear things that happen in the artist alley late at night when the crazies come out.

304
00:23:13,261 --> 00:23:17,220
Speaker 7: Yeah, I I'm in in for the the social aspect of the artist alley.

305
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:21,640
Speaker 7: I really couldn't care less if I made money because the money is really secondary to me.

306
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:27,959
Speaker 7: it's just mostly meeting people who I know on the internet and Being able to meet other webcomic people.

307
00:23:28,821 --> 00:23:30,071
Speaker 0: Actually, I have an interesting story about that.

308
00:23:30,091 --> 00:23:39,294
Speaker 0: I Shouldn't have even attempted to do this But I was fighting with Kinko's today And I just so happened to meet an artist from the artist alley who I had no idea who it was.

309
00:23:40,257 --> 00:23:49,000
Speaker 0: at the Kinko's just they were also messing up his work, so we kind of had that common interest and He was having his stuff printed down.

310
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:55,039
Speaker 0: We just he saw my badge had artists written on it And we just kind of struck up a conversation in terms of what's going on.

311
00:23:55,381 --> 00:23:59,415
Speaker 0: So like that kind of social it's very very friendly, you know everyone's very accepting.

312
00:23:59,455 --> 00:24:01,664
Speaker 0: even though he didn't know my work I didn't know his.

313
00:24:01,684 --> 00:24:06,003
Speaker 0: I'm not that much into anime, and he was an anime artist But it we still had.

314
00:24:06,163 --> 00:24:08,069
Speaker 0: you know it was very very social environment.

315
00:24:08,711 --> 00:24:17,314
Speaker 1: so to change directions entirely for a moment now All of you are at an anime con right now, so I guess if you do enjoy anime What was the first anime you ever saw like?

316
00:24:17,354 --> 00:24:17,999
Speaker 1: what was it that?

317
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:26,971
Speaker 1: Got you into this either into anime as a fan or into the subculture of anime as in you're going to conventions now on a regular Basis, okay, I'm gonna say this for the record.

318
00:24:27,252 --> 00:24:32,774
Speaker 1: I do not really enjoy anime I I used to when I was in seventh and eighth grade, but I remember in sixth grade.

319
00:24:32,834 --> 00:24:34,420
Speaker 1: my gateway drug was Pokemon.

320
00:24:35,402 --> 00:24:41,542
Speaker 1: I watched it when I was 12 years old, and I wanted to be that For me.

321
00:24:41,803 --> 00:24:46,659
Speaker 6: um I used to deliver my papers early on my paper route so I could get home and watch Dragon Ball Z.

322
00:24:49,621 --> 00:25:03,400
Speaker 7: My dad is Japanese, and I grew up on Doraemon and The original Dragon Ball on Unsubtitled untranslated, I would just watch it with my dad, and he would translate it for me at key points.

323
00:25:06,266 --> 00:25:17,060
Speaker 0: actually Every morning in middle school when I lived in Florida Dragon Ball Z came on at about 6 30 in the morning, and I will admit this right here.

324
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,305
Speaker 0: I've never admitted to anybody.

325
00:25:18,847 --> 00:25:25,140
Speaker 0: I watched very several several several episodes of Dragon Ball Z Not even knowing what it was and I don't regret it.

326
00:25:26,757 --> 00:25:28,630
Speaker 1: I Have been dating this boy

327
00:25:28,651 --> 00:25:31,925
Speaker 7: for two and a half years And I never knew that

328
00:25:32,246 --> 00:25:33,068
Speaker 2: for the record his

329
00:25:33,088 --> 00:25:33,730
Speaker 6: power level

330
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,452
Speaker 1: is above

331
00:25:34,452 --> 00:25:34,934
Speaker 0: 1 million.

332
00:25:34,974 --> 00:25:36,077
Speaker 0: This is the best place.

333
00:25:36,198 --> 00:25:38,345
Speaker 0: kind of You're dead to me.

334
00:25:38,526 --> 00:25:40,152
Speaker 0: the internet to kind of my.

335
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:42,400
Speaker 0: we can see my face and my shame.

336
00:25:42,922 --> 00:25:45,375
Speaker 4: My gateway drug was one of the stranger ones.

337
00:25:45,455 --> 00:25:52,396
Speaker 4: it was Evangelion Because if you if you sink your teeth into Evangelion, and you like it you're.

338
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:58,460
Speaker 4: you're smooth into anime But if you find Evangelion, and you hate it you get turned off forever.

339
00:25:59,203 --> 00:26:03,720
Speaker 4: It's one of those hit-or-miss ones because it's just so crazy and creepy and strange.

340
00:26:04,582 --> 00:26:10,160
Speaker 7: My I like the Doraemon where they found the dinosaur egg, and then they raised the dinosaur.

341
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,760
Speaker 1: What that was oddly specific?

342
00:26:14,681 --> 00:26:15,704
Speaker 6: Yes, Ava was crap.

343
00:26:15,904 --> 00:26:23,253
Speaker 2: my my summer going into my freshman year of high school the sci-fi channel did their weekend festival of anime Which comprised of three films.

344
00:26:23,293 --> 00:26:24,080
Speaker 2: I watched them twice.

345
00:26:25,202 --> 00:26:28,919
Speaker 2: It was robot carnival lens man and vampire hunter D.

346
00:26:29,261 --> 00:26:33,296
Speaker 1: You realize that we that is the exact same thing.

347
00:26:33,316 --> 00:26:38,374
Speaker 1: that was the first anime I ever saw robot carnival robot carnival lens man vampire hunter D's.

348
00:26:38,534 --> 00:26:40,180
Speaker 2: watch the same festival on the sci-fi.

349
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:40,983
Speaker 1: I think we did.

350
00:26:41,023 --> 00:26:41,946
Speaker 1: I was in fourth grade.

351
00:26:42,428 --> 00:26:42,889
Speaker 2: Oh my god.

352
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:43,210
Speaker 2: I was.

353
00:26:43,231 --> 00:26:44,013
Speaker 2: I was gonna go.

354
00:26:44,495 --> 00:26:45,077
Speaker 1: how old are you?

355
00:26:45,117 --> 00:26:53,045
Speaker 2: I'm only 24 Nike boobily mushrooms, I'm older than you Mustache.

356
00:26:53,066 --> 00:26:55,044
Speaker 1: I look like I'm 30 haha.

357
00:26:57,003 --> 00:26:59,525
Speaker 1: Alright, so in terms of you know anime fan I'm coming to Otakon.

358
00:26:59,545 --> 00:27:00,973
Speaker 1: now many of you go to other con state.

359
00:27:00,993 --> 00:27:02,320
Speaker 1: Kineticon is a big example.

360
00:27:02,882 --> 00:27:08,820
Speaker 1: How does Otakon compare to the other conventions in terms of how they treat the webcomic artist or the artist how they run the artist?

361
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,194
Speaker 1: Alley how much you enjoy going to the convention and how much business you do.

362
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:14,860
Speaker 1: a lot of topics there?

363
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,065
Speaker 1: But I hope we'll get some good.

364
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:18,815
Speaker 2: I think Kineticon is the best example.

365
00:27:18,956 --> 00:27:26,005
Speaker 2: I think of a. I think Kineticon is like the Boston of Conventions in my opinion.

366
00:27:26,045 --> 00:27:27,612
Speaker 2: It's the biggest little convention.

367
00:27:27,632 --> 00:27:29,580
Speaker 2: I've ever been to the people there.

368
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:43,276
Speaker 2: I mean the convention is growing and it's getting big, but it still has the feel To me at least of a really small Personable convention, I think that's the lure of a. I think that's the lure to it for a lot of people.

369
00:27:43,638 --> 00:27:46,746
Speaker 2: not to mention that It is Amazingly friendly to web comics.

370
00:27:47,147 --> 00:27:48,211
Speaker 2: a big convention like this.

371
00:27:48,612 --> 00:27:48,853
Speaker 2: Yes.

372
00:27:49,033 --> 00:27:53,828
Speaker 2: It is amazingly good for business Amazingly good for sales and exposure, but it is.

373
00:27:54,310 --> 00:28:00,496
Speaker 2: it is in my opinion a lot less personable Just for the sheer size.

374
00:28:01,942 --> 00:28:03,027
Speaker 0: What kind of has to be in that case?

375
00:28:03,047 --> 00:28:08,640
Speaker 0: So yeah, that's not really blaming anybody It's just it's just a numbers thing.

376
00:28:09,961 --> 00:28:15,720
Speaker 2: Big it's like a big corporation can't be as people friendly as say like Joe's diner down the street.

377
00:28:19,701 --> 00:28:20,985
Speaker 0: Well, I mean I live in Hartford.

378
00:28:21,025 --> 00:28:25,659
Speaker 0: So I mean Kineticon is a very very kind of no-brainer con for me is very stress-free.

379
00:28:26,821 --> 00:28:30,272
Speaker 0: No, I mean me knowing the people who run it personally.

380
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:39,840
Speaker 0: I've kind of taken my own personal, you know I've had my fingerprint on Kineticon itself, you know They let me run my film festival now, which we just had our first year of and we're gonna have it next year as well.

381
00:28:40,393 --> 00:28:46,060
Speaker 0: so And along with that, I mean, I'm helping a lot of the other people who are not local to the area.

382
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,287
Speaker 0: I help them around stuff like that.

383
00:28:47,790 --> 00:29:00,176
Speaker 0: So in terms of the con I'm not sure how much of me being a local person factors into that but Otacon is definitely a lot bigger a lot more stranger in a strange town kind of thing.

384
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:05,313
Speaker 2: I Think we should take this time to introduce someone just walked in to the room.

385
00:29:05,393 --> 00:29:07,380
Speaker 2: Well, actually we should let him introduce himself, I suppose.

386
00:29:08,768 --> 00:29:10,800
Speaker 5: Well, why would you go and do something silly like that?

387
00:29:14,381 --> 00:29:23,880
Speaker 5: No, no seriously, all right, I'm not actually Grom that's just Mookie's, you know thing.

388
00:29:26,021 --> 00:29:27,285
Speaker 5: My name is actually Garth.

389
00:29:27,546 --> 00:29:33,180
Speaker 5: the last name is Graham, but if you spell it funny without like the second a you do get in fact Grom.

390
00:29:35,268 --> 00:29:52,789
Speaker 5: Yes, exactly And I as everyone in the room, I think knows but people listening don't I do the webcomic community About the Kineticon thing Garth and I attended two cons one con just before Kineticon and one con and then Kineticon itself.

391
00:29:52,809 --> 00:29:55,747
Speaker 4: and This kind of goes back to your question about the comic-con thing.

392
00:29:56,288 --> 00:29:56,509
Speaker 4: Is that?

393
00:29:56,589 --> 00:30:03,489
Speaker 4: our first convention as community was wizard con Philly Last year and So we had.

394
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:12,000
Speaker 4: we had attended Webcomic we'd attended conventions as guests as attendees, but we'd never been behind the table yet.

395
00:30:12,925 --> 00:30:26,500
Speaker 4: And so going to wizard con Philly Straight up as a comic convention and then coming to Kineticon It was a very stark contrast between the two and who we met who we talked to who came to talk to us.

396
00:30:28,242 --> 00:30:37,919
Speaker 4: And I definitely agree with the two people that have already talked about how How small and and how familiar the people Kineticon were versus the bigger?

397
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:50,720
Speaker 4: The bigger con that is is wizard con as well as the the crowd and the people that you meet there Since this is a free-form and this also kind of touches on the larger versus smaller conventions.

398
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,106
Speaker 5: There was something asked about at comic-con.

399
00:30:53,126 --> 00:30:54,590
Speaker 5: Was there that I missed?

400
00:30:57,337 --> 00:31:02,272
Speaker 1: we were talking about Philly Wizard world and the other wizard world and how different they are from anime conventions.

401
00:31:02,834 --> 00:31:03,496
Speaker 5: Oh, yes.

402
00:31:03,817 --> 00:31:04,038
Speaker 5: Okay.

403
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:06,333
Speaker 5: Yeah Yeah, two different worlds.

404
00:31:06,393 --> 00:31:12,379
Speaker 5: completely Comic books are not the same as manga basically how shell-shocked.

405
00:31:13,461 --> 00:31:18,673
Speaker 7: comic-book fans and sci-fi fans are versus anime fans and how personable.

406
00:31:19,034 --> 00:31:21,119
Speaker 7: and if anime fans tend to be over.

407
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:31,199
Speaker 7: comic-book fans and sci-fi fans who kind of tend to stay away from each other They're citing the comic-book fans are in sci-fi as well are very.

408
00:31:31,219 --> 00:31:41,211
Speaker 5: they're very into themselves very into their their work not their work, but the Their interests and nothing else.

409
00:31:41,231 --> 00:31:42,336
Speaker 5: There's less of a community.

410
00:31:42,376 --> 00:31:44,786
Speaker 5: I think going on there It's very very people.

411
00:31:44,806 --> 00:31:47,939
Speaker 5: look at the merchandise and look at the comics whatever they happen to be.

412
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,979
Speaker 5: You know the con for and that's about as far as it goes.

413
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,886
Speaker 1: Well, I guess why do you think that is?

414
00:31:52,966 --> 00:31:57,020
Speaker 1: why is the science fiction and American comic not so much the indie comic?

415
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:03,951
Speaker 1: But the old, you know, we like to call them underwear perverts But the superhero comics versus indie comics and webcomics.

416
00:32:04,011 --> 00:32:09,972
Speaker 1: and why are the communities so different despite the fact that they have many Similarities in terms of what they actually are?

417
00:32:09,992 --> 00:32:11,379
Speaker 0: I could take a stab at this one.

418
00:32:12,102 --> 00:32:16,756
Speaker 0: I think it has to do with just the for which ones cater towards which audiences.

419
00:32:16,776 --> 00:32:20,652
Speaker 0: I mean the anime Community seems to be centered around.

420
00:32:20,673 --> 00:32:22,526
Speaker 0: I Mean, I'm not gonna this.

421
00:32:22,648 --> 00:32:25,044
Speaker 0: I don't mean this to sound insulting But a lot of this.

422
00:32:25,465 --> 00:32:44,195
Speaker 0: a lot of the anime culture comes from online and comes from the younger crowd as well And a lot of that caters towards just inhibition in general and I think with sci-fi being more of I guess a personal interest and People who like sci-fi usually tend to meet in real life not on the internet.

423
00:32:44,235 --> 00:32:54,200
Speaker 0: not it's just I mean This is just me kind of shooting the brie and a lot of this right phrase, but it's like Anime community just seems to be built on inhibition in general.

424
00:32:54,361 --> 00:32:58,580
Speaker 0: So with that inhibition comes a lot of shared passion and a lot of common interests.

425
00:32:58,963 --> 00:33:07,124
Speaker 0: I mean this is coming from someone who doesn't even have the common interests But I see the passion in them and I respect the passion, you know, like any other Sci-fi fans.

426
00:33:07,224 --> 00:33:14,264
Speaker 2: I think it's almost like a code word between them and they're very careful about I think who they let into the club So to speak.

427
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:22,340
Speaker 2: so I think a lot of them are very guarded against a lot of these Youngsters so speak Who are just running?

428
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:32,485
Speaker 2: blindly Enthusiastically towards anything new and cool-looking whereas they have always been very careful as to what they choose what they Tend to like.

429
00:33:32,626 --> 00:33:34,072
Speaker 2: and I think it's just.

430
00:33:34,193 --> 00:33:50,660
Speaker 2: I think it's just generational really I think if the at if the sci-fi fantasy crowd became a little more accepting of the anime crowd, I think Maybe a whole new sort of convention would be born a hybrid almost a sci-fi anime convention.

431
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:57,679
Speaker 1: I'm surprised our friend Conrad hasn't chimed in with something about 4chan at this point.

432
00:33:58,464 --> 00:34:00,074
Speaker 0: I I have nothing to say about 4chan.

433
00:34:00,235 --> 00:34:01,604
Speaker 1: I Like.

434
00:34:01,745 --> 00:34:10,420
Speaker 6: three years ago when I was a freshman in college I discovered this website off a link to a very from a very Questionable webcomic that I was reading at the time called the lounge.

435
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,094
Speaker 1: I thought you're gonna say questionable content make some kind of joke.

436
00:34:13,315 --> 00:34:15,284
Speaker 1: No, no No It was very.

437
00:34:15,324 --> 00:34:24,860
Speaker 6: it was a very questionable webcomic that I read during high school and I found a link off of it and I started Visiting it because back in the day it used to be funny and now it's a pile of crap and I've disowned it entirely.

438
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:27,246
Speaker 1: Now what exactly is 4chan?

439
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:31,679
Speaker 1: I've been I've been studying it like and I I would say I don't know.

440
00:34:31,962 --> 00:34:33,818
Speaker 1: I like Jane Goodall among the Apes.

441
00:34:35,081 --> 00:34:36,833
Speaker 5: It's where images go to die.

442
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:39,987
Speaker 5: Well, no, not really.

443
00:34:40,047 --> 00:34:43,257
Speaker 5: they just get shared around in a giant pile, but what kind of images?

444
00:34:43,277 --> 00:34:45,849
Speaker 1: that's why that's why Everything mostly pornographic.

445
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:50,047
Speaker 1: Oh, I mean, I guess the way I would go with this Is that like you all are very savage.

446
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,494
Speaker 1: the internet, you know webcomics and such.

447
00:34:51,534 --> 00:35:02,108
Speaker 1: but you know FARC calm or versus slash dot and how like there's levels of how contiguous the conversations are and how much Someone who is not into the crowd can follow them.

448
00:35:02,148 --> 00:35:06,562
Speaker 1: and like someone who doesn't know about FARC culture could not read FARC and understand It easily.

449
00:35:06,582 --> 00:35:09,272
Speaker 1: 4chan is beyond even my.

450
00:35:09,292 --> 00:35:11,560
Speaker 1: I have no idea what these kids are talking about.

451
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:15,139
Speaker 1: It's like a foreign language and now I know how my grandparents feel about computers.

452
00:35:16,122 --> 00:35:19,380
Speaker 6: Be fair some of the boards on 4chan aren't terrible boards.

453
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:26,775
Speaker 6: I do visit wallpapers occasionally to grab you know Fresh wallpapers when I need them and technology can be an actually useful source of information.

454
00:35:26,836 --> 00:35:27,598
Speaker 0: read it for the articles.

455
00:35:29,883 --> 00:35:33,386
Speaker 2: Generally, you know I've entered a slash s every now and then.

456
00:35:33,406 --> 00:35:39,169
Speaker 6: no but but the popular boards are all crap because they're just over completely overpopulated With 13 year olds.

457
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,018
Speaker 6: I can't deal with it.

458
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,235
Speaker 1: Well, so the popular things are crap, but if something's obscure then it's suddenly cool.

459
00:35:43,577 --> 00:35:48,433
Speaker 6: No, no No, because 13 year olds don't care about technology and they don't care about wallpapers.

460
00:35:48,473 --> 00:35:50,519
Speaker 6: They just care about posting up their favorite porn image.

461
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,599
Speaker 5: Yes, you can the internet is for porn.

462
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:00,486
Speaker 5: Oh Come on.

463
00:36:00,506 --> 00:36:02,994
Speaker 5: I was gonna try and start a musical here, but fail on me.

464
00:36:03,255 --> 00:36:04,840
Speaker 1: You guys you think any of us can drink?

465
00:36:05,283 --> 00:36:11,497
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I've been in a musical born I can sing Bob Seger because he uses exactly three notes.

466
00:36:12,019 --> 00:36:15,099
Speaker 0: Nice I've been in the Cradle Rock.

467
00:36:19,186 --> 00:36:21,670
Speaker 0: Don't judge me That's about unions.

468
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,119
Speaker 0: What's wrong with that?

469
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,313
Speaker 6: Did anybody else notice that the panel sucked this year?

470
00:36:27,058 --> 00:36:30,871
Speaker 1: Yes I think to say about the bukkake panel.

471
00:36:31,554 --> 00:36:33,019
Speaker 1: That was like the most popular panel.

472
00:36:34,128 --> 00:36:35,020
Speaker 1: What was all right?

473
00:36:35,321 --> 00:36:39,597
Speaker 1: That was an unfortunately named panel that would not have been allowed to have that name and people noticed it.

474
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:40,380
Speaker 1: do-it-yourself.

475
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:49,620
Speaker 1: bukkake is just a hentai drawing panel that they called it something controversial in order to get people to show up kind of like how 4chan staged a fake fight at their panel last year.

476
00:36:51,321 --> 00:36:54,098
Speaker 5: Nice didn't they have a hentai drawing panel?

477
00:36:55,342 --> 00:36:56,365
Speaker 1: There were multiple hentai.

478
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,169
Speaker 6: it was last night at 10 p.m.

479
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:00,094
Speaker 6: And I was in attendance to that panel.

480
00:37:00,355 --> 00:37:07,755
Speaker 7: one of our friends won a prize For what the best hentai know the scariest dick what what?

481
00:37:07,935 --> 00:37:11,980
Speaker 1: wait a minute as in The one they drew a skip the scary.

482
00:37:12,086 --> 00:37:18,719
Speaker 1: Okay I was going to ask the one with which they were equipped by whatever being may or may not have created them or the one that They constructed out of his drawing.

483
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:20,772
Speaker 0: I was in person a hence.

484
00:37:20,812 --> 00:37:21,519
Speaker 0: I was drawn.

485
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,935
Speaker 0: This is crossing a line.

486
00:37:23,976 --> 00:37:29,580
Speaker 1: I would think Well, I guess in terms of panels, what do you guys think of panels and anime cons?

487
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,316
Speaker 1: I mean, it seems that panels are generally used.

488
00:37:32,376 --> 00:37:33,020
Speaker 1: what comes in general?

489
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:39,739
Speaker 1: They're generally supposed to be at least the way most kind of seem to see them as fans trying to Show something off or do something.

490
00:37:40,241 --> 00:37:41,686
Speaker 1: Should they be more controlled?

491
00:37:41,747 --> 00:37:44,957
Speaker 1: should only people who know what they're talking about or experts be allowed on these panels?

492
00:37:44,977 --> 00:37:45,700
Speaker 1: should it be anyone?

493
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,899
Speaker 1: Should they be more strict more loose?

494
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:53,060
Speaker 1: Because obviously a lot of people agree that the panels are generally not so good these days and what can be done about that?

495
00:37:53,641 --> 00:37:54,945
Speaker 1: I mean you many of you speak on panels.

496
00:37:54,985 --> 00:38:07,250
Speaker 4: So I think that one of the best examples of a finely done panel is heroes and villains Done by someone in this room Because he knows what he's talking about.

497
00:38:07,431 --> 00:38:18,780
Speaker 4: He draws from everywhere good bad, he doesn't just talk about his own stuff and Then he opens it up and and does point-counter point with people in the audience.

498
00:38:19,141 --> 00:38:20,205
Speaker 4: That's what panels should be.

499
00:38:20,607 --> 00:38:21,189
Speaker 4: panels are not.

500
00:38:21,249 --> 00:38:22,755
Speaker 4: just look what I've done.

501
00:38:22,775 --> 00:38:23,840
Speaker 4: I'm really cool.

502
00:38:25,081 --> 00:38:34,859
Speaker 4: It's supposed to be a level of discussion based on Shared information and so you lay forth the information ahead of time and then you discuss it.

503
00:38:35,924 --> 00:38:36,369
Speaker 2: I'm gonna kiss.

504
00:38:36,389 --> 00:38:39,949
Speaker 2: you fall in the mouth, you know he's talking about my writing.

505
00:38:39,989 --> 00:38:48,760
Speaker 2: unique heroes and memorable villains panel and Panels are magnificent in what they are in what they can achieve for you.

506
00:38:49,403 --> 00:38:53,040
Speaker 2: That heroes and villains panel for me at least has gained me a ton of new readers.

507
00:38:53,881 --> 00:39:07,560
Speaker 2: People have come up to me afterwards and says I don't know what you're due, but I'm going to find out now because Because I loved your panel It's a great way for people who are just getting started in web comics or anything to get some exposure and some FaceTime.

508
00:39:09,763 --> 00:39:26,540
Speaker 2: Ideally They are I think a boon to conventions and one of the real drawing points because conventions that are just a big dealers room Like wizard world Yeah, any of those many any of those dealers any of those conventions that are just a big dealers room that have no panels.

509
00:39:27,248 --> 00:39:27,957
Speaker 2: No one likes them.

510
00:39:28,903 --> 00:39:33,200
Speaker 2: But there are very good examples of bad panels and I'll let the assembly take care of that.

511
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:35,852
Speaker 1: Someone has been waiting with bated breath to speak on this time.

512
00:39:35,993 --> 00:39:37,078
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm just way too opinion.

513
00:39:37,339 --> 00:39:42,334
Speaker 0: Mookie Your keyboard there was ideally because like obviously you're this is gonna be one of those.

514
00:39:42,354 --> 00:39:43,999
Speaker 1: This is why communism fails speeches.

515
00:39:46,282 --> 00:39:49,098
Speaker 1: Panels are great on paper, but the computer is my friend.

516
00:39:53,221 --> 00:39:56,191
Speaker 0: I've attended Mookie's panel twice and it is the ideal panel.

517
00:39:56,633 --> 00:39:57,275
Speaker 0: It's a person.

518
00:39:57,476 --> 00:39:59,263
Speaker 2: I'm not saying I'm gonna be blush I'm really.

519
00:39:59,284 --> 00:40:01,258
Speaker 0: I'm not saying this wonderful panel.

520
00:40:02,502 --> 00:40:08,200
Speaker 0: I'm not saying this to complement you but well, I mean it is an informative panel.

521
00:40:08,702 --> 00:40:12,320
Speaker 0: it speaks on personal experience and while other people it's.

522
00:40:13,322 --> 00:40:16,290
Speaker 0: It's information that's being shared about a subject.

523
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:20,300
Speaker 0: The problem is is that I'm my very little knowledge of panels.

524
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,146
Speaker 0: I've attended a few I've been on it.

525
00:40:22,889 --> 00:40:25,940
Speaker 0: I've attended the webcomic ones both in the audience and on the stage.

526
00:40:27,022 --> 00:40:30,618
Speaker 0: This year the webcomic panel, which I've only heard rumors of.

527
00:40:30,658 --> 00:40:36,323
Speaker 0: I didn't actually attend it, but there was only There was.

528
00:40:36,524 --> 00:40:38,389
Speaker 0: well, here's I heard that there was.

529
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:48,237
Speaker 0: only in seeing the schedule - there's only one person actually on the panel who had Anything to do with a webcomic and that was Matt Boyd from Matt call who doesn't really like to talk that much.

530
00:40:48,578 --> 00:40:56,470
Speaker 0: So That he I know I heard Ian ran But Ian made a run for it.

531
00:40:56,791 --> 00:41:14,656
Speaker 0: I don't know how many other people were on this panel But there were at least three including him and one of them um is a webcomic critic which Which you really can't have because it's just no more than a Fanboy talking about a medium which he really doesn't understand anything about.

532
00:41:15,158 --> 00:41:30,536
Speaker 0: so And especially with webcomics which are you know idealistic and just so self-congratulatory as it is You know You you need some people to actually have some sort of criticism and who know things about storytelling I'd love to see Mookie actually take control of that panel as well.

533
00:41:30,978 --> 00:41:33,915
Speaker 0: Although he kind of does it already.

534
00:41:33,996 --> 00:41:38,488
Speaker 0: but Well for anyone What they're talking about being the panelists.

535
00:41:38,668 --> 00:41:56,666
Speaker 1: for anyone in our forums who have witnessed the epic arguments that have occurred in the forums of The front row crew forum the the fact that we agree almost entirely on this point is amazing because I've been to numerous panels recently where I or someone I know is actually an expert on the subject that they're talking about and People do pet like.

536
00:41:56,686 --> 00:42:05,380
Speaker 1: there's a panel on the Nintendo new system though We and the person doing it didn't really know anything about the way didn't really wasn't a Nintendo expert or anything.

537
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:19,820
Speaker 1: they were just some dude who decided to run a panel about something they thought was cool and they didn't know anything and they just kind of rambled on stage or The come this panels where people don't know what they're talking about But the audience always assumes that anyone up on the stage with a microphone knows what they're talking about.

538
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:23,220
Speaker 0: I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that a lot of people just like the idea that they're panelists.

539
00:42:23,401 --> 00:42:25,228
Speaker 0: They don't even care about the panel itself.

540
00:42:25,288 --> 00:42:26,373
Speaker 1: I like the fact that I'm a panel.

541
00:42:26,393 --> 00:42:28,423
Speaker 0: Well, you know, you're talking about, you know It helps.

542
00:42:28,483 --> 00:42:35,317
Speaker 1: I mean Usually yeah, I guess I would honestly really like to see panels be more.

543
00:42:35,759 --> 00:42:42,700
Speaker 1: I guess I don't want to say credentials because I'd hate to Get to that point where you need to prove that you know what you're talking about to get on a panel.

544
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,900
Speaker 1: But maybe some sort of you know show something a panel you've done before or can tell if you you know what you're doing.

545
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,181
Speaker 0: You're not.

546
00:42:48,201 --> 00:42:49,926
Speaker 1: so you think that you'd think that.

547
00:42:49,946 --> 00:42:54,520
Speaker 1: I do think that ideally most of the most panelists aren't the person who's running the panels.

548
00:42:54,641 --> 00:43:02,093
Speaker 0: Never meets anyone involved in the panel until the day the panel The audience the audience is gonna know that the guy upstage is cold bullshit.

549
00:43:02,294 --> 00:43:03,699
Speaker 1: No, you know, the audience have no idea.

550
00:43:04,322 --> 00:43:04,723
Speaker 0: I don't have.

551
00:43:04,744 --> 00:43:06,873
Speaker 2: that much depends on how confident the guy is.

552
00:43:06,974 --> 00:43:07,355
Speaker 0: That's true.

553
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:08,340
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, it's confident.

554
00:43:08,481 --> 00:43:11,100
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't want to rag on the geeks be guy because he's a cool guy.

555
00:43:11,181 --> 00:43:18,377
Speaker 1: we've we've got on his show and he's been on our show, but Though this Nintendo revolution we panel he did he didn't know anything about.

556
00:43:18,417 --> 00:43:19,200
Speaker 1: he was kind of talking.

557
00:43:19,461 --> 00:43:28,380
Speaker 1: okay, the audience were asking him the kind of questions that you would ask at like a Nintendo press conference as though he would know the Answers and he kind of BS half of them.

558
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:34,605
Speaker 1: But the audience really does think whoever's up on the panel is just an expert and they're there by the grace of whatever gods Run the panel, huh?

559
00:43:35,229 --> 00:43:39,407
Speaker 2: I'd like to say I mean just kind of Segueing a little bit and maybe a little.

560
00:43:39,788 --> 00:43:42,700
Speaker 2: I'd like to just I guess throw out to the assembly.

561
00:43:45,253 --> 00:43:47,390
Speaker 2: I guess I'm growing just generally distaste.

562
00:43:48,474 --> 00:43:48,817
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.

563
00:43:48,837 --> 00:43:56,316
Speaker 2: I Have a growing distaste for general web comics panels in general, honestly I agree entirely.

564
00:43:56,336 --> 00:43:57,080
Speaker 1: web comics are.

565
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:00,175
Speaker 1: they're not necessarily a fully mature medium But they're out there.

566
00:44:00,275 --> 00:44:02,807
Speaker 1: It's not like you need to explain to people what a webcomic is.

567
00:44:02,827 --> 00:44:03,530
Speaker 2: Well, no, it's not.

568
00:44:03,731 --> 00:44:04,538
Speaker 2: It's not that.

569
00:44:05,001 --> 00:44:09,300
Speaker 2: it's that when anime conventions law or any conventions.

570
00:44:09,742 --> 00:44:15,119
Speaker 2: lump all the web comics guests together and Put them on a hey meet your favorite web comics guests.

571
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:22,519
Speaker 2: the last few that I have been on with the exception of Well, I guess maybe one a few years ago have been terrible.

572
00:44:23,562 --> 00:44:27,251
Speaker 2: and it's not because the people who are on the panel are terrible People.

573
00:44:27,672 --> 00:44:30,381
Speaker 2: what ends up happening is it becomes very unfocused.

574
00:44:31,304 --> 00:44:44,836
Speaker 2: it because and and I'm gonna sound so elitist by saying this and I really don't mean it but a lot of the veteran webcomics get mixed in with the newcomer webcomics and a lot of the veteran webcomic errs know to keep their answers kind of

575
00:44:45,238 --> 00:44:45,479
Speaker 0: brief

576
00:44:45,499 --> 00:44:52,491
Speaker 2: and This is no fault of the people who are just getting started in webcomics who want to get their faces out who want to say Something.

577
00:44:52,531 --> 00:45:10,987
Speaker 2: that's memorable, but when one person asks a question that could be answered in under a minute By one person up there, but of course everyone wants to chime in if you've never been on a panel before So the same question gets answered the same way over the next half an hour.

578
00:45:11,973 --> 00:45:16,410
Speaker 1: So, how do you all feel about say having professional moderators at panels like that?

579
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:22,842
Speaker 1: do you think someone who is actually there to cut people off or Direct the conversation aside from people are on the panel.

580
00:45:23,143 --> 00:45:24,930
Speaker 2: I think that's I think it's a great idea.

581
00:45:25,432 --> 00:45:35,443
Speaker 2: It was tried this year at the uber webcomic panel at Kinetic on but it It just kind of got a little out of control because there were more panelists than then.

582
00:45:35,463 --> 00:45:37,250
Speaker 2: I think is healthy.

583
00:45:39,212 --> 00:45:48,535
Speaker 5: It's always sad and I've noticed this at a lot of webcomic panels that I've been on, you know, the general webcomic panel that we kind of been all talking about is that they're More often than not.

584
00:45:48,575 --> 00:45:51,590
Speaker 5: it seems to be that there are more panelists than people in the audience.

585
00:45:53,972 --> 00:45:55,037
Speaker 0: Plus you what you're talking about.

586
00:45:55,158 --> 00:45:57,389
Speaker 0: adding an editor to web comics.

587
00:46:01,571 --> 00:46:04,139
Speaker 5: That's against everything we stand exactly.

588
00:46:04,259 --> 00:46:07,430
Speaker 0: that's what it has to be disorderly for this to work.

589
00:46:07,992 --> 00:46:10,485
Speaker 1: The web comics is an ideal Brian.

590
00:46:10,545 --> 00:46:15,575
Speaker 6: You're a madman a Speaking strictly as a panel goer.

591
00:46:15,776 --> 00:46:20,330
Speaker 6: I would rather see panels better distributed and better organized rather than seeing a moderator.

592
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:26,374
Speaker 6: I would rather see as Mookie stated veteran webcomic artists to get like with veterans and Beginners with beginners.

593
00:46:26,735 --> 00:46:33,280
Speaker 6: that way people can pick who they want to see pick what answers they want to know rather than having a man Stand in the middle and try to sort it out while it's going on.

594
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:35,630
Speaker 1: I'm talking more in terms of panels that exist.

595
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:37,930
Speaker 1: I mean there are people who know their stuff, but they're not good public speakers.

596
00:46:38,452 --> 00:46:42,505
Speaker 1: There are people who like a wonderful show or a wonderful comic and they just they can't.

597
00:46:42,565 --> 00:46:43,950
Speaker 1: they don't know how to massage a crowd.

598
00:46:44,111 --> 00:46:45,315
Speaker 1: And I'm talking about more.

599
00:46:45,596 --> 00:46:55,290
Speaker 1: have someone who know like professionals who know what they're doing to direct the conversation So that people who have something to say can get it out without Sounding dumb even when they're obviously not dumb.

600
00:46:55,371 --> 00:47:01,670
Speaker 1: They just don't know how to deal with a crowd or with You know a situation where someone who's loud takes over a panel because there's no moderator to shut them up.

601
00:47:01,831 --> 00:47:02,835
Speaker 2: I absolutely agree with that.

602
00:47:02,976 --> 00:47:12,027
Speaker 2: some people who are just all talk and no substance Can easily overshadow one of the most brilliant writers who just gets really nervous and fun of everyone.

603
00:47:12,107 --> 00:47:14,235
Speaker 2: the reason why he does his work In front of a webcomic.

604
00:47:14,677 --> 00:47:17,570
Speaker 2: I'm sorry behind a computer screen is because maybe he is afraid of crowds.

605
00:47:17,671 --> 00:47:19,084
Speaker 2: So I agree with you completely on that.

606
00:47:21,131 --> 00:47:37,226
Speaker 4: One of the things that Connecticut did not this past year, but two years ago was they had their meet-and-greets with Two or three comics at a time and the interesting thing about that was Is that you could say hey?

607
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:48,413
Speaker 4: I want to go see Dominic Deegan and Mac Hall and Vg cats all in one panel, and then you know that you're only dealing with that small group of people with only those small Questions.

608
00:47:48,634 --> 00:48:05,590
Speaker 4: now I realize I just picked very strange combination but instead of having 50 people on a stage when you ask what's your inspiration and Have everybody answer you could at least you could do and it would feel strange in with 50 people on stage to ask.

609
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:09,537
Speaker 4: so Mac Hall What do you think about this?

610
00:48:09,698 --> 00:48:12,188
Speaker 1: and have nobody else be able to answer that question?

611
00:48:12,549 --> 00:48:12,690
Speaker 1: yeah?

612
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:17,750
Speaker 4: It could move faster, but you would feel as a questioner from the from the audience.

613
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:18,412
Speaker 4: You would feel

614
00:48:18,593 --> 00:48:19,617
Speaker 1: rude to everyone

615
00:48:19,657 --> 00:48:21,323
Speaker 4: else on the panel to ask

616
00:48:21,383 --> 00:48:23,310
Speaker 2: that that format did not work for me.

617
00:48:23,771 --> 00:48:25,697
Speaker 2: I they they paired me up a kinetic.

618
00:48:25,737 --> 00:48:27,101
Speaker 2: that was a very noble idea.

619
00:48:27,161 --> 00:48:29,669
Speaker 2: that kinetic on did to pair up webcomics.

620
00:48:30,151 --> 00:48:36,961
Speaker 2: I got paired up with Tim Buckley of control alt delete and Brian Clevenger of 8-bit theater two very good friends of mine by the way.

621
00:48:36,981 --> 00:48:44,363
Speaker 2: I love them both to death, but the that year The questions were all to the questions that were asked.

622
00:48:44,444 --> 00:48:48,643
Speaker 2: to quote the three of us They answered and by the time they got to me.

623
00:48:48,844 --> 00:48:56,343
Speaker 2: by the time I opened my mouth someone else was already asking with those two guys another question, so I was the third wheel.

624
00:48:57,655 --> 00:49:00,249
Speaker 0: See that's interesting because that that format actually worked out for me.

625
00:49:01,892 --> 00:49:02,858
Speaker 0: You were paired up with two other people.

626
00:49:02,899 --> 00:49:06,679
Speaker 0: I was paired up with one other person and Yeah, but that was purely purely by luck.

627
00:49:07,041 --> 00:49:07,202
Speaker 0: Well.

628
00:49:07,282 --> 00:49:08,830
Speaker 0: It was by luck, but it did work out.

629
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:11,168
Speaker 0: I mean well also and it done them to that what?

630
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:17,239
Speaker 0: Happened two years ago was that they had all the groupings of webcomics And then they had their uber webcomic panel.

631
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:21,920
Speaker 0: so all the meet-and-greet stuff got all the stupid You know random questions that are always asked.

632
00:49:22,261 --> 00:49:26,237
Speaker 0: it got them all out of the way with all the smaller Inspiration all those.

633
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:27,629
Speaker 5: what's your favorite fruit?

634
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:28,653
Speaker 0: that's why.

635
00:49:28,733 --> 00:49:32,190
Speaker 0: that's why two years ago the uber webcomic panel was great because

636
00:49:32,854 --> 00:49:33,217
Speaker 1: All of the

637
00:49:33,438 --> 00:49:44,498
Speaker 0: bad questions were covered out of the way and then all the important ones were done at the uber panel, and I was paired up with Scott ransomware of eg cats and It was one other person And it was a very controlled environment.

638
00:49:44,839 --> 00:49:50,040
Speaker 0: everyone was there for them, but I'm It was by pure luck that it worked out for me.

639
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,190
Speaker 0: Just because Scott's kind of a shy guy.

640
00:49:53,479 --> 00:50:10,724
Speaker 0: I'm not Conversation turned to me stuff like that, but I mean I think it would work that kind of format Just if you tweaked that and not just rely all on the uber webcam panel Especially because the webcam panel is repeated the same in every convention.

641
00:50:11,286 --> 00:50:12,330
Speaker 0: It's all this the same questions.

642
00:50:12,671 --> 00:50:13,777
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was the thing I've noticed.

643
00:50:13,797 --> 00:50:18,379
Speaker 1: the most is that I mean if you have a generic panel It's just we are webcomic artists.

644
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:20,209
Speaker 1: people always ask the same questions no matter what.

645
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:25,224
Speaker 1: How do you feel more about having the webcomic panel where that's the webcomic panel?

646
00:50:25,425 --> 00:50:34,548
Speaker 1: our topic at this convention is Blah about webcomics or blah about whatever and then it's just kind of more round table kind of like this only with a lot less alcohol.

647
00:50:35,572 --> 00:50:36,960
Speaker 5: I'm actually yeah, that sounds like fun.

648
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:37,201
Speaker 5: Well.

649
00:50:37,221 --> 00:50:42,303
Speaker 2: Yeah, because we all everyone All this alcohol, but I'm the only one with a glass of wine.

650
00:50:42,343 --> 00:50:45,715
Speaker 1: so honestly everyone here Yeah, all right I love drinks and Conrad.

651
00:50:45,996 --> 00:50:51,194
Speaker 1: as the conversation went on everyone was so into it that they all kind of just put their drinks down And did forgot about it.

652
00:50:51,916 --> 00:50:53,481
Speaker 2: I think you're right where to represent.

653
00:50:53,541 --> 00:50:56,250
Speaker 1: I'm gonna say I drank steadily throughout this entire conversation.

654
00:50:58,231 --> 00:51:01,364
Speaker 2: Anything to make the general webcomics panels more focused.

655
00:51:01,524 --> 00:51:02,368
Speaker 2: I am all for.

656
00:51:02,388 --> 00:51:05,968
Speaker 0: yeah I think if the topics were good because a lot of me the topics are kind of limited.

657
00:51:06,028 --> 00:51:16,729
Speaker 0: also There are more time because the last thing I would want to see is a webcomic a panel where the topic is like promotion You know because for an audience obviously they don't care about the promotion.

658
00:51:17,934 --> 00:51:22,369
Speaker 1: I mean what if it's a audience of aspiring webcomic artists, that's true It depends on your audience.

659
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:29,181
Speaker 0: But I mean I guess that would be the best one for I don't know Otakon because there'd be a lot more Much bigger pool to choose from.

660
00:51:29,684 --> 00:51:30,390
Speaker 0: the topics were good.

661
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:32,507
Speaker 1: You can have a panel about anything at Otakon and people would go to it.

662
00:51:33,914 --> 00:51:37,690
Speaker 4: I think an interesting thing would be to group the webcomics.

663
00:51:38,373 --> 00:51:53,508
Speaker 4: I made a weird list a minute ago, but if you group the webcomic Genres sort of like by people who do One-shot-a-day joke strips you did people who were maintaining a high in-depth storyline.

664
00:51:53,929 --> 00:51:56,793
Speaker 4: if you grouped if you if if and when

665
00:51:57,154 --> 00:51:57,554
Speaker 1: you in

666
00:51:58,155 --> 00:52:01,439
Speaker 4: as as the the convention staff if you were to control

667
00:52:01,459 --> 00:52:01,519
Speaker 0: and

668
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:05,618
Speaker 4: And with with some level of finesse hopefully

669
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:06,420
Speaker 2: who was

670
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:13,459
Speaker 4: at the panel what the topic would be you could sort of move the conversation along like you're saying

671
00:52:13,479 --> 00:52:13,539
Speaker 1: and

672
00:52:15,983 --> 00:52:17,007
Speaker 4: And maybe you wouldn't need

673
00:52:17,047 --> 00:52:18,734
Speaker 1: an uberwebcomic panel or

674
00:52:19,156 --> 00:52:21,422
Speaker 4: maybe you could Deal

675
00:52:21,482 --> 00:52:21,642
Speaker 1: with

676
00:52:21,743 --> 00:52:26,799
Speaker 4: those groups of people individually throughout and just say okay for one question for this

677
00:52:27,822 --> 00:52:28,243
Speaker 3: Audience

678
00:52:28,484 --> 00:52:30,471
Speaker 4: so you don't have one question for 50 people.

679
00:52:30,491 --> 00:52:35,677
Speaker 4: you have one question for 20 people and then you have the next question for 20 people and then you have the next question like that.

680
00:52:35,738 --> 00:52:37,041
Speaker 1: I don't You would.

681
00:52:37,583 --> 00:52:43,020
Speaker 4: you'd have to really work at it, and I haven't put in enough time or thought into how it would work out.

682
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:45,546
Speaker 4: I'm just making up ideas.

683
00:52:45,928 --> 00:52:48,840
Speaker 0: I think people just have to stop looking at webcomics as a concrete thing.

684
00:52:49,422 --> 00:52:50,084
Speaker 0: I mean if we're gonna.

685
00:52:50,565 --> 00:52:55,562
Speaker 0: It's just people see webcomics, and that's I Don't know.

686
00:52:55,582 --> 00:52:56,890
Speaker 0: I was trying to say like that.

687
00:52:57,192 --> 00:52:59,263
Speaker 0: They say like seeing baseball It's just a sport.

688
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:02,014
Speaker 0: so it's like they use that to cover all sports.

689
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:05,889
Speaker 0: so a Webcomic is a webcomic is a webcomic doesn't quite work.

690
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:08,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean as a as a completely non webcomic artists.

691
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:19,800
Speaker 1: to me my perspective That's the genre that's it I Mean.

692
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:30,752
Speaker 1: I guess my perspective purely as a fan of webcomics and a friend of webcomic artists seems to be that the general webcomics panel Existed when webcomics were a new thing and people were like what's this all about.

693
00:53:30,813 --> 00:53:32,880
Speaker 1: or oh my god my all the webcomic artists.

694
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:38,218
Speaker 1: I love her there, and it's just amazing and they can ask these questions and now it seems like it's just an unnecessary thing.

695
00:53:38,258 --> 00:53:42,720
Speaker 1: like now Podcasting is kind of new and a podcasting panel Seems like it has a great draw.

696
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:51,600
Speaker 1: But two years from now if people are still doing generic podcasting panels They would be I think just as I don't want to use the word useless, but useless as generic webcomic panel.

697
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:55,251
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, you think of it like if you were to have an anime convention.

698
00:53:55,411 --> 00:54:06,955
Speaker 5: Just one panel that just says anime panel And that's it To explain to all the people coming to the anime convention what anime is.

699
00:54:07,015 --> 00:54:08,680
Speaker 5: yes right exactly what influences?

700
00:54:09,106 --> 00:54:16,058
Speaker 7: to watch anime Same thing and especially at a convention like kinetic on that seems to have made his claim to fame.

701
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:19,028
Speaker 7: being The webcomic friendly convention.

702
00:54:19,349 --> 00:54:26,820
Speaker 0: having a generic webcomics panel seems kind of useless Because they've gotten away almost gotten away from the webcomic catering.

703
00:54:27,061 --> 00:54:31,059
Speaker 0: They had the webcomic catering when they were doing the several panels grouping people together.

704
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:34,573
Speaker 0: now It's just the one big you know panel, but they invite all of us.

705
00:54:35,255 --> 00:54:35,556
Speaker 0: Oh well.

706
00:54:35,717 --> 00:54:36,480
Speaker 0: I live in Hartford.

707
00:54:39,663 --> 00:54:41,838
Speaker 0: I Still want them to pay my plane fare.

708
00:54:43,721 --> 00:54:47,373
Speaker 0: I'll drive to Bradley Airport have them swing me around in the air.

709
00:54:47,774 --> 00:54:49,360
Speaker 0: land me get a cab right?

710
00:54:49,621 --> 00:54:55,289
Speaker 1: No, you just go to the airport hang out in the lounge for four hours Grab you by the ankles, and I'll swing you around in the air.

711
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:55,651
Speaker 2: How's that?

712
00:54:55,671 --> 00:54:56,715
Speaker 0: That's cool.

713
00:54:56,755 --> 00:55:00,004
Speaker 0: I'd go to Connecticut for that Sexy.

714
00:55:00,248 --> 00:55:01,099
Speaker 0: let's have you give me a band.

715
00:55:02,806 --> 00:55:28,440
Speaker 4: I Actually had a brief conversation with with Matt Daigle the con chair of kinetic on earlier And he said that this year was a very strange year for scheduling Because a lot of people were either not showing up Friday Because they couldn't get off work Or they had to leave before Sunday even started so they could get back or something along those lines.

716
00:55:28,804 --> 00:55:36,520
Speaker 4: So it was very strange To try to arrange things that I mean even guests that were showing up.

717
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:44,773
Speaker 4: We're asking questions through email of well if I buy a three-day pass do I get a discount if I'm not gonna be there Friday or something like that?

718
00:55:45,238 --> 00:55:58,140
Speaker 4: and He he was very confused by it because they hadn't had this issue in other years And they could split things up across multiple days whereas in this convention It seemed like Saturday was the main King day.

719
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:02,896
Speaker 1: Well actually in terms of I mean I go to like every freaking convention now and in terms of the convention.

720
00:56:02,916 --> 00:56:23,540
Speaker 1: I guess industry Smaller conventions are for most people a one-day affair and as we saw with the New York Comic Con debacle when it just collapsed under its own weight Because the fact that they didn't expect people to show up and everyone in the world showed up Saturday Unless a con is large like Katsu khan oda khan even kind of and kinetic on is getting there.

721
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:26,318
Speaker 1: They're very close to being the I guess big con category.

722
00:56:26,379 --> 00:56:27,563
Speaker 1: that It's very.

723
00:56:27,603 --> 00:56:34,100
Speaker 1: people won't take a vacation day from work to go to the con all three days And it really is economical to go one day.

724
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:43,955
Speaker 1: So all the cons that aren't an oda khan are having a huge problem with the fact that they have more people Saturday than and All the other days combined, but if they put programming on Friday a lot of people don't show up to it.

725
00:56:43,975 --> 00:56:49,840
Speaker 1: I Don't know if there's an answer to that other than become a bigger con or that is a bigger problem.

726
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:57,044
Speaker 2: I think more for like the the fall and winter conventions as opposed to the summer conventions Friday programming.

727
00:56:57,084 --> 00:57:01,379
Speaker 2: for obviously summer conventions don't aren't hassled as much because people are out of school.

728
00:57:02,803 --> 00:57:13,579
Speaker 2: A couple of conventions are smart enough to start their programming on Friday at like five or six o'clock in the at night Because that's when people are out of work and out of school out of class.

729
00:57:15,286 --> 00:57:16,035
Speaker 2: And I've gone through the lines.

730
00:57:16,075 --> 00:57:26,192
Speaker 2: Yeah So it's it's seasonal size and I guess Look, I'm basically run out of questions.

731
00:57:26,212 --> 00:57:27,299
Speaker 1: You guys want to wrap up I can.

732
00:57:33,414 --> 00:57:38,072
Speaker 1: Well, you should come to our live show tomorrow at 10 in panel 4.

733
00:57:38,072 --> 00:57:42,032
Speaker 0: I've actually just not too long ago figure out the pun of podcast Project.

734
00:57:42,072 --> 00:57:44,200
Speaker 7: I had to tell him I think that's witty.

735
00:57:44,662 --> 00:57:45,224
Speaker 5: I hated it.

736
00:57:45,465 --> 00:57:46,610
Speaker 0: I hated the term before.

737
00:57:47,212 --> 00:57:50,284
Speaker 1: Yeah, the problem with it is that so many people, you know, they hear.

738
00:57:50,304 --> 00:57:51,187
Speaker 1: Oh you have a radio show.

739
00:57:51,207 --> 00:57:52,573

742
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:08,040

743

761
00:59:30,903 --> 00:59:43,120

762
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:47,039
Speaker 4: 2001 was put together really really well.

763
00:59:48,679 --> 01:00:03,632
Speaker 4: I last saw it several years ago, and so I don't necessarily have the The analysis and and and the strength of mind to really remember it But at the time I thought it was well put together.

Speaker 1: It is in one of our hotel rooms Laundry everywhere.

837
01:05:12,571 --> 01:05:19,210
Speaker 2: My favorite movie ever made is the adventures of Baron munchausen by Terry Gilliam.

838
01:05:21,525 --> 01:05:31,269
Speaker 2: It's such a wonderful fantasy that just eschews most all reality and just tells the and tells of the immense power of Storytelling even if it's a total lie.

839
01:05:31,831 --> 01:05:38,310
Speaker 2: But who knows I just love Baron munchausen for the adventure that it takes me on and that I just can leave reality behind.

840
01:05:39,392 --> 01:05:40,277
Speaker 2: One of the best movies.

841
01:05:40,337 --> 01:05:42,387
Speaker 2: I think ever made was the Iron Giant.

842
01:05:46,022 --> 01:05:51,487
Speaker 2: If you had a small bit of clapping at I that movie is such a tearjerker even though It's not a very sad ending.

Speaker 2: I cried.

844
01:05:52,554 --> 01:05:53,420
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I cry.

845
01:05:53,560 --> 01:06:04,978
Speaker 2: I think every time I watch a movie I cry a little earlier into the movie, so I think eventually I'll just cry with a opening credits roll It to you, and you'll start yeah, or just say Mookie the Iron Joe.

846
01:06:04,998 --> 01:06:10,124
Speaker 7: oh Hey, I get Mookie's mic this time.

847
01:06:10,345 --> 01:06:14,616

848
01:06:14,676 --> 01:06:15,117
Speaker 1: well.

849
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:16,040
Speaker 2: I don't like to brag.

01:06:16,938 --> 01:06:19,709
Speaker 1: Oh My guys are so they money.

Speaker 2: so say my name is Mookie.

853
01:06:22,202 --> 01:06:25,380
Speaker 2: I am the writer and artist of Dominick Deegan Oracle for hire.

854
01:06:32,485 --> 01:06:33,066
Speaker 1: All right.

855
01:06:33,427 --> 01:07:04,027
Speaker 7: at this particular moment in time with my whimsical nature my favorite movie has to be everything is illuminated Which is which is an excellent excellent film with excellent excellent music if you ever ever have the chance to see it I. it's a very really really whimsical movie, and I kind of love it to death, and it's beautifully shot and Probably I Because I'm dating Brian Carroll.

856
01:07:04,047 --> 01:07:06,957
Speaker 7: I have to say citizen Kane is the best movie ever made.

857
01:07:07,539 --> 01:07:11,016
Speaker 7: but But in my personal opinion.

858
01:07:11,076 --> 01:07:19,736
Speaker 7: I think That in my world the best movie ever made is wings of desire Which I don't think anyone in this room has seen except for myself.

859
01:07:20,258 --> 01:07:25,580
Speaker 7: in retrospect It was actually a huge probably should have been a huge influence of my comic.

860
01:07:26,163 --> 01:07:33,809
Speaker 7: It was eventually made into a horrible horrible American remake called City of Angels which I hope none of you have seen.

861
01:07:33,829 --> 01:07:38,468
Speaker 7: I hate Nicolas Cage.

862
01:07:38,488 --> 01:07:49,078
Speaker 1: oh God think of the good old song Oh What oh is that you'd let me keep going.

863
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:50,503
Speaker 1: I eventually would have done something.

864
01:07:50,523 --> 01:07:53,702
Speaker 1: it was somewhat like that song almost No, I don't believe you.

865
01:07:54,489 --> 01:07:58,530
Speaker 1: well It would have been as close as my voice is gonna get after three days of shouting at all of my friends.

866
01:08:00,031 --> 01:08:01,013
Speaker 7: Wings of desire.

867
01:08:01,274 --> 01:08:03,159
Speaker 7: it's a beautiful beautiful movie.

868
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:09,584
Speaker 5: I Have this horrible curse of filling in everything that movies or stories or books or anything leaves out.

869
01:08:09,925 --> 01:08:22,850
Speaker 5: so I take I go I go Like latch on to the parts those shining jewels in all the crap that I that are awesome And I build up what should have been instead of what is and I ignore that.

870
01:08:23,471 --> 01:08:30,640
Speaker 5: So I think I would actually really really like this movie that I did not know City of Angels was based on as City of Angels was actually kind of enjoyable.

871
01:08:30,881 --> 01:08:31,968
Speaker 4: actually I have seen it.

872
01:08:32,270 --> 01:08:33,033
Speaker 4: They showed it.

873
01:08:33,073 --> 01:08:44,078
Speaker 4: they showed it to us in architecture so that we would know Where that movie came from because they had a film series that they were showing us great classics And that was one of them.

874
01:08:44,841 --> 01:08:45,607
Speaker 7: It was made like the 80s.

875
01:08:46,751 --> 01:08:57,048
Speaker 1: Well not to rush you but garage band for anyone who doesn't use max is Somewhat terrible and we don't have more than about 10 more minutes of recording before it arbitrarily decides to stop.

876
01:08:57,228 --> 01:09:00,379
Speaker 0: I can make this fast By the way, I'm.

Speaker 7: I do a comic that nobody should read called fallen You shut up.

881
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:22,010
Speaker 4: I Would like to apologize to Brian before he starts my knowledge of movies.

882
01:09:22,350 --> 01:09:25,843

Speaker 0: I passed no judgment on you.

886
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:44,491
Speaker 0: The best movie ever made hands down and I can argue this point by counterpoint is Citizen Kane by Orson Welles 1941.

887
01:09:44,491 --> 01:09:47,420
Speaker 5: The even tastier when they're when you're dead.

01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:53,685

891
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:10,379
Speaker 0: Metropolis the original metropolis Fritz Lang not the anime remake, which I've never seen.

892
01:10:12,608 --> 01:10:13,999
Speaker 0: Rashomon and usual suspects.

893
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:17,324
Speaker 0: Stranger is a great movie But it's not one of my favorites.

894
01:10:17,907 --> 01:10:21,528
Speaker 0: F for fake is another going by Orson Welles and also touch of evil But we're small.

895
01:10:21,548 --> 01:10:26,940
Speaker 0: and another favorite a lot of them come from different decades which I'm trying to keep with a theme if I were to make a top 10 list.
