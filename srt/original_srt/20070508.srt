1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,248
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, May 8th.

2
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:12,271
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,532 --> 00:00:14,600
Speaker 1: I'm rim and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:15,461 --> 00:00:19,559
Speaker 1: Tonight we teach you all about the old old NES game.

5
00:00:20,143 --> 00:00:21,958
Speaker 1: rescue the embassy mission.

6
00:00:24,522 --> 00:00:25,578
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:28,827 --> 00:00:31,854
Speaker 0: So today I saved a crow and as a result, I almost missed my train.

8
00:00:32,316 --> 00:00:34,180
Speaker 1: Why would you save a crow?

9
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:42,524
Speaker 0: Well, I I changed trains between the nice train that takes me up to Croton and then the diesel ugly smelly train that takes Me the rest of the way.

10
00:00:43,046 --> 00:00:49,060
Speaker 0: and you know over the train tracks in most places in downstate, New York There's a lot of those big glassed in walkways.

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,600
Speaker 0: You go up the stairs go across the tracks come down to whatever platform you're supposed to be on.

12
00:00:52,871 --> 00:01:03,052
Speaker 0: Yeah well none of the windows up there open and somehow this big crow had gotten himself up there and he didn't know how to get out and He was banging into windows back and forth.

13
00:01:03,072 --> 00:01:04,360
Speaker 0: He'd obviously been at this for a while.

14
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,545
Speaker 0: He was pretty tired.

15
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,275
Speaker 0: His mouth was hanging open and he had this look of what.

16
00:01:08,476 --> 00:01:09,400
Speaker 0: what am I doing wrong?

17
00:01:09,742 --> 00:01:10,306
Speaker 0: I don't get it.

18
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,354
Speaker 0: I don't get it.

19
00:01:11,374 --> 00:01:22,980
Speaker 0: Ah and people were kind of avoiding him and every now and then someone walk over like they're gonna help him and then they'd think and realize They couldn't come up with any way to help him short of grabbing him, which probably wasn't the best idea.

20
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:26,311
Speaker 1: No crows are kind of dirty and nasty.

21
00:01:26,412 --> 00:01:28,519
Speaker 0: No, they're not really dirty and nasty not like pigeons.

22
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, those pigeons are dirtier and SDR doesn't mean crows are not dirty and they're not.

23
00:01:33,341 --> 00:01:39,011
Speaker 0: The only reason I didn't grab the crow was that I really didn't feel like getting my hands picked up Because I'm pretty sure I could have caught him.

24
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:40,500
Speaker 0: he was still pretty dazed up there.

25
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,979
Speaker 1: Well, I realized that you know short of say hummingbirds and things.

26
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:50,340
Speaker 1: You can grab a lot of birds if you really want to but you got a really want it for real.

27
00:01:50,561 --> 00:01:57,530
Speaker 0: Emily knew someone who not only could grab seagulls, but liked to Wow Okay, I don't like to but I'm pretty sure that I could.

28
00:01:57,831 --> 00:01:59,335
Speaker 1: and one day when I get some gloves.

29
00:01:59,396 --> 00:02:03,650
Speaker 1: I'm totally grabbing pigeons Just to prove it to myself that I can do it.

30
00:02:04,092 --> 00:02:05,197
Speaker 0: We'll have to get a video of it.

31
00:02:05,217 --> 00:02:08,770
Speaker 0: Send it to pen Like see what you did see what you made us do.

32
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:08,850
Speaker 1: Yep.

33
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:11,982
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I decide alright I can't?

34
00:02:12,264 --> 00:02:15,119
Speaker 0: I go down to my platform and then I think no I can't leave that crew up there.

35
00:02:15,581 --> 00:02:38,852
Speaker 0: so I go back up and I try to and I realize that the best way to the course of action after I realized that There's no way to open any of those windows is to as best as I can direct the crow Toward the stairway and shoot which is also glass all the way down it and trick him into going all the way down and then flying away Mm-hmm, but if I make any sudden moves or direct in the wrong way He just flies into a window and hurts himself further.

36
00:02:38,912 --> 00:03:04,660
Speaker 0: So it was kind of like a puzzle game and I spend several minutes kind of like Maneuvering very slowly and like put my arms in different ways and I get him to go down the stairs and then stair by stair I kind of push him down and then eventually he gets outside and he sits there for a minute and he's like I don't know like he expected there to be another glass wall in And then he flies away really cautiously and then he shits about four times and then he disappears.

37
00:03:06,446 --> 00:03:07,791
Speaker 0: He was like, I don't know.

38
00:03:07,851 --> 00:03:08,874
Speaker 0: I guess he was stressed out.

39
00:03:08,954 --> 00:03:09,837
Speaker 1: Maybe he wasn't shit.

40
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:11,328
Speaker 1: unless he's flying I don't know.

41
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:12,500
Speaker 1: They don't shit when they're standing.

42
00:03:12,982 --> 00:03:17,280
Speaker 0: So I saved him and then I ran to my train and that was my story for today.

43
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,672
Speaker 1: They just there reminds me when I was a kid one time.

44
00:03:19,893 --> 00:03:24,239
Speaker 1: and there's a bird in the yard And it was there for days and it was hobbling around.

45
00:03:24,681 --> 00:03:25,806
Speaker 1: So we called.

46
00:03:25,826 --> 00:03:28,637
Speaker 1: he tried to figure out who to call to take care of this bird.

47
00:03:28,938 --> 00:03:29,480
Speaker 0: animal control.

48
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:38,220
Speaker 1: we called various animal controls and Eventually, we got to someone who didn't tell us to call someone else and they said what kind of bird is it?

49
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,943
Speaker 1: I'm like, I don't know It's a bird.

50
00:03:41,425 --> 00:03:42,027
Speaker 1: It's hobbling.

51
00:03:42,047 --> 00:03:43,131
Speaker 1: They're like, well, what color is it?

52
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:43,953
Speaker 1: I'm like black.

53
00:03:44,275 --> 00:03:45,298
Speaker 1: They're like, oh, it's a crow.

54
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,571
Speaker 1: Whatever We're not doing shit for it.

55
00:03:47,772 --> 00:03:53,660
Speaker 1: Nah, apparently Rim cares more about the animal crow than the animal control.

56
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,440
Speaker 0: Well, you realize that animal controls primary duty is to remove dangerous animals.

57
00:03:58,741 --> 00:04:02,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there weren't so many dangerous animals for them to remove in my town.

58
00:04:03,121 --> 00:04:03,924
Speaker 1: Yeah, like what a week?

59
00:04:04,085 --> 00:04:07,399
Speaker 0: what they usually do is remove like a rabid whatever that's water.

60
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:15,076
Speaker 1: Yeah We've called them for that before, you know skunk during the day Strange badger or raccoon during the day in the backyard.

61
00:04:15,096 --> 00:04:21,560
Speaker 0: See when I was a kid Not badger, but there was a skunk in high school who would come out during the day all the time, but he wasn't rabid.

62
00:04:21,963 --> 00:04:24,039
Speaker 0: He was just old and pissed off.

63
00:04:24,843 --> 00:04:27,473
Speaker 1: It's even worse At least worse for people.

64
00:04:27,493 --> 00:04:39,179
Speaker 1: Yep So today there was a pleasant surprise that no one expected and the people who released the surprise didn't even say anything about it And it was up to the people on the internet to discover it for themselves.

65
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:44,380
Speaker 1: You may know that Google has a program called Google Reader.

66
00:04:44,902 --> 00:04:46,470
Speaker 1: It is an RSS feed reader.

67
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:55,218
Speaker 1: you subscribe to RSS feeds and it Allows you to read all the news in those feeds and a very convenient and easy to use interface on a web page.

68
00:04:55,399 --> 00:05:02,080
Speaker 0: sadly While a wallet is definitely probably the best RSS reader out there period I don't find it that useful.

69
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:02,803
Speaker 0: But that's just me.

70
00:05:03,285 --> 00:05:07,100
Speaker 1: I pretty much read all the news on the internet exclusively through Google Reader.

71
00:05:07,624 --> 00:05:09,259
Speaker 1: See the original Google Reader sucked.

72
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:17,240
Speaker 1: It was just kind of fancy but not too useful and the recent the new Google Reader Pretty much beats the shit out of blog lines and in all those other things.

73
00:05:17,602 --> 00:05:23,030
Speaker 0: I really only use it so I can read headlines from news sites that are blocked at work So I know what the news is when I get home.

74
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:24,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty good use right there.

75
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,044
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's the only use.

76
00:05:26,124 --> 00:05:27,991
Speaker 0: I never use it outside of work ever.

77
00:05:28,011 --> 00:05:30,560
Speaker 1: See I subscribe to like 30 something feeds.

78
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:37,856
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just find if I try to get all the news in my feeds I either get a lot of duplicates because all the sites get a lot of duplicates.

79
00:05:37,876 --> 00:05:38,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't like that.

80
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,027
Speaker 0: It's not worth it at that point.

81
00:05:40,228 --> 00:05:51,943
Speaker 1: Oh, see I just I get so many duplicates, you know I basically scroll down and I process the headlines in my mind very quickly And when I see something that I actually want to read I click I open a new tab and I keep going and I've seen Something before.

82
00:05:51,963 --> 00:05:52,666
Speaker 1: I just keep going.

83
00:05:52,686 --> 00:06:01,660
Speaker 0: see the thing is if I just go to dig slash dot FARC right in a row I see 99% of what I would have seen in Google Reader and if I need any like Oh real news.

84
00:06:02,182 --> 00:06:07,740
Speaker 1: I also hit the Google News to have Google News dig and slash dot in my Google Reader and a FARC in there.

85
00:06:08,423 --> 00:06:10,330
Speaker 1: And it's the same thing.

86
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,037
Speaker 1: only it's about taking me less time.

87
00:06:12,077 --> 00:06:12,760
Speaker 1: that's what it's about.

88
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,433
Speaker 1: You know, it takes me longer to go and read dig.

89
00:06:15,755 --> 00:06:16,076
Speaker 1: it would take.

90
00:06:16,157 --> 00:06:22,880
Speaker 1: that's like, you know If I wake up in the morning, there's like three new pages of digs after read three pages worth it all that scrolling.

91
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,091
Speaker 1: I can go through everything a lot faster in Google Reader.

92
00:06:26,111 --> 00:06:28,800
Speaker 1: It takes me less time to process the same information.

93
00:06:29,081 --> 00:06:29,784
Speaker 1: That's what it's about.

94
00:06:30,146 --> 00:06:32,476
Speaker 0: So I guess I don't don't go through everything because a lot of it.

95
00:06:32,496 --> 00:06:35,002
Speaker 0: I don't care about Everything.

96
00:06:35,123 --> 00:06:37,072
Speaker 1: the stuff I don't care about I just scroll right past.

97
00:06:37,193 --> 00:06:38,620
Speaker 0: that's what the use of dig is for me.

98
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,260
Speaker 0: I just only look at what's on the front page.

99
00:06:40,642 --> 00:06:44,640
Speaker 0: And if it didn't if it's not on the front page when I go to dig it's probably irrelevant.

100
00:06:45,162 --> 00:06:49,180
Speaker 1: Oh, but see what if something was awesome was on the front page when you weren't looking at it for yesterday.

101
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:50,464
Speaker 0: It depends on how awesome it is.

102
00:06:50,564 --> 00:06:51,327
Speaker 0: one the videos.

103
00:06:51,508 --> 00:06:56,769
Speaker 0: there aren't enough videos period so I see them all no matter what and for Anything else if it's that awesome.

104
00:06:56,829 --> 00:06:58,619
Speaker 0: It's on FARC and I see everything on FARC.

105
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:07,846
Speaker 1: Well, regardless it takes me less time to process all that same news on one page where everything is just a single line as Opposed to many pages of things are spread out.

106
00:07:08,107 --> 00:07:12,360
Speaker 0: It really doesn't help that the vast majority of RSS feeds are garbage.

107
00:07:12,782 --> 00:07:14,734
Speaker 1: Well, that's another advantage of Google Reader.

108
00:07:14,795 --> 00:07:15,640
Speaker 1: Is that it handles?

109
00:07:16,181 --> 00:07:16,382
Speaker 1: Yes, it's.

110
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:20,556
Speaker 1: it's good enough to handle crappy RSS feeds in ways that other readers do not.

111
00:07:20,737 --> 00:07:21,680
Speaker 0: that is definitely true.

112
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,095
Speaker 0: If only could handle the dupes on really poorly done RSS feeds.

113
00:07:25,175 --> 00:07:25,617
Speaker 1: Yeah.

114
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:38,420
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, so this Google Reader, which you're this gaming day, so you probably don't care about Google Reader Google without saying a word released a special version of Google Reader that you can use on the Wii

115
00:07:38,962 --> 00:07:39,905
Speaker 0: Hot damn,

116
00:07:39,985 --> 00:07:48,880
Speaker 1: so if you got your Wii browser and you know that we news channel is pretty good I kind of like it, but it only reads the AP news wire doesn't read any other news.

117
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,880
Speaker 1: Well now you can go to Google Reader and your Wii Opera and do the same sort of thing.

118
00:07:55,001 --> 00:07:57,114
Speaker 1: Only any news you want you could read.

119
00:07:57,254 --> 00:07:58,160
Speaker 1: you can listen to geek nights.

120
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:03,920
Speaker 1: Well, if you had enough RAM in the Wii, which you know But you could read geek nights is webpage through the Google Reader.

121
00:08:04,322 --> 00:08:09,806
Speaker 0: If only they would just set it up to where you could plug a flash drive into the Wii and it would just work as RAM for the browser.

122
00:08:09,926 --> 00:08:10,309
Speaker 0: Yeah.

123
00:08:10,429 --> 00:08:12,059
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they they only did that in the DS.

124
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:13,726
Speaker 1: I don't think they're gonna do that on the Wii.

125
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:16,900
Speaker 0: If only they'd released the Opera DS cartridge in the US.

126
00:08:17,442 --> 00:08:19,311
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think they're on their way to doing it.

127
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:21,260
Speaker 0: But yeah, they're not gonna be a while.

128
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:25,740
Speaker 1: They're not gonna release the DS fat version in stores, you're gonna have to special order that that's fine.

129
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,805
Speaker 0: I don't have a DS fat.

130
00:08:26,986 --> 00:08:28,353
Speaker 1: I know but I'm awesome.

131
00:08:28,373 --> 00:08:29,860
Speaker 1: I don't really want the Opera DS browser.

132
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,205
Speaker 1: Anyway, cuz I have a laptop.

133
00:08:31,225 --> 00:08:31,948
Speaker 1: What is it?

134
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:34,277
Speaker 0: I want it because one I don't have a laptop.

135
00:08:34,317 --> 00:08:44,195
Speaker 0: and even when I get a Laptop, there's a difference between like say I'm just walking and I want to check something really quick pulling the laptop out booting it Connecting to the Wi-Fi versus just I got my DS out.

136
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:45,300
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's probably my pocket.

137
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,400
Speaker 0: I just go whip bam slash dot and then I leave.

138
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,005
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't really have that need.

139
00:08:50,326 --> 00:08:55,464
Speaker 1: and like I used to have that ability when I had the blackberry whatever and I never really Used that.

140
00:08:55,484 --> 00:09:01,420
Speaker 0: I don't know what I see myself using it A lot for is suddenly hitting a Google Maps while I'm out in the city somewhere.

141
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:04,757
Speaker 1: I had Google Maps on the blackberry and I never really used it.

142
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:15,454
Speaker 0: I don't know I see myself using it a lot but part of that is cuz I go to places that I'm not familiar with all over the Bronx Using a little book or a paper map more often, but well to see that little books.

143
00:09:15,494 --> 00:09:24,475
Speaker 1: great unless you're looking for a business Yeah, yeah, and if I was, you know looking for something like that if I really needed this feature suddenly I just used the one on my phone.

144
00:09:24,777 --> 00:09:28,775
Speaker 0: because Yeah, well unless I hack my phone I have to pay quite a bit of money.

145
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:29,800
Speaker 1: I had to pay like five bucks.

146
00:09:29,981 --> 00:09:30,723
Speaker 1: It's not a big deal.

147
00:09:30,884 --> 00:09:31,667
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do have a new phone.

148
00:09:31,707 --> 00:09:32,571
Speaker 0: No, I got my razor.

149
00:09:32,932 --> 00:09:33,454
Speaker 1: Oh great.

150
00:09:33,635 --> 00:09:34,217
Speaker 0: It's okay.

151
00:09:34,558 --> 00:09:35,723
Speaker 0: It's okay It was free.

152
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,145
Speaker 0: Yep.

153
00:09:36,407 --> 00:09:37,572
Speaker 0: It's better than any cell phone.

154
00:09:37,592 --> 00:09:41,387
Speaker 0: I've ever owned which I that's true I can say about every cell phone I have ever owned.

155
00:09:41,408 --> 00:09:42,471
Speaker 1: that is also true.

156
00:09:43,113 --> 00:09:44,960
Speaker 0: and in two years, I'm gonna get a new phone.

157
00:09:45,364 --> 00:09:46,476
Speaker 1: Yep, that's true.

158
00:09:46,557 --> 00:09:59,876
Speaker 1: Also Yeah, so if you want to read some RSS feeds Google reader We the cool thing about this is they actually have Like things bound to the different buttons on your remote and that's pretty cool.

159
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:07,700
Speaker 1: how they got a web page To recognize the remote buttons like, you know pushing button one does this and button two does that and plus and minus?

160
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,972
Speaker 1: You know do this and that and that's pretty cool.

161
00:10:11,032 --> 00:10:12,900
Speaker 1: that they got a web page to recognize those things.

162
00:10:13,161 --> 00:10:16,059
Speaker 1: It's not easy to do for you non tech people out there.

163
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:31,740
Speaker 0: So a water of Nintendo fame came out and there's a lot of articles and headlines basically saying something along the lines of hardcore gamers will be satisfied by the end of 2007 in regards to the Wii and the article is actually very long.

164
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:49,427
Speaker 0: It comes from an interview with Iwata and I'm not gonna go through all the points He makes because he talks about a lot and I if you're a Nintendo fan or a video gamer at all I highly recommend that you read the transcript because You'll get a lot of insight into the direction Nintendo's heading and also a lot of the Ideas that Iwata has personally about gaming.

165
00:10:49,808 --> 00:10:57,194
Speaker 0: he says that currently there are 45 Wii games in development and another 79 DS titles though many of them are second party.

166
00:10:57,777 --> 00:10:58,058
Speaker 1: Yeah.

167
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:06,260
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, I guess all I can really say about the gaming part is that it's about time Because the DS when it started didn't really have so much for it.

168
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,100
Speaker 0: It was kind of a waste and after I played the three games I bought I really didn't use it much.

169
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,043
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got the DS.

170
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,531
Speaker 1: I'd like Mario 64 and it was like I still I'd.

171
00:11:13,551 --> 00:11:17,524
Speaker 1: never after I other games came out for the DS I stopped playing Mario 64.

172
00:11:17,524 --> 00:11:18,647
Speaker 1: I never went back to it.

173
00:11:18,768 --> 00:11:19,290
Speaker 0: See luckily.

174
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,116
Speaker 0: I'd never played Mario 64.

175
00:11:21,116 --> 00:11:22,380
Speaker 0: So that was actually pretty fun.

176
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:26,375
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was fun because I while I had played Mario 64 in the past.

177
00:11:26,616 --> 00:11:27,500
Speaker 1: I hadn't played it out.

178
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:32,878
Speaker 1: So this said played it out for me and I don't need to play Mario 64 ever again for a long time Yep.

179
00:11:33,462 --> 00:11:42,231
Speaker 0: But the DS finally is coming to its own and games that fully use it or at least Really respect all the capabilities of the DS are coming out.

180
00:11:42,312 --> 00:11:47,847
Speaker 0: and I mean if you need any indication of how well the DS is going You still can't buy one in Japan.

181
00:11:48,188 --> 00:11:52,020
Speaker 0: They're constantly sold out no matter what the DS sells crazily.

182
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:57,840
Speaker 0: It's amazing and I can see why the DS is still I would say the best console in the world right now.

183
00:11:58,221 --> 00:12:01,051
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's probably oh, it's the best console ever.

184
00:12:01,071 --> 00:12:03,279
Speaker 1: It could be I don't know.

185
00:12:03,945 --> 00:12:09,000
Speaker 0: I I think in a few more years I would consider it the best console ever in terms of the use.

186
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,394
Speaker 1: I've gotten out of it unless something else comes along that can unseat it.

187
00:12:12,635 --> 00:12:15,600
Speaker 1: but as of right now I think the DS might be the best console ever.

188
00:12:15,871 --> 00:12:37,812
Speaker 0: Yeah but the Wii is still in the same boat that the DS was when it first came out with one important difference which I think is hurting the Wii in terms of gamers like us and the so-called hardcore gamer which is I really don't like that word because People really use it in a lot of different ways and the media really Throws it around and it really isn't a useful word anymore.

189
00:12:38,254 --> 00:12:39,860
Speaker 0: because what constitutes a hardcore gamer?

190
00:12:40,282 --> 00:12:45,112
Speaker 0: But the DS did really poorly early on in terms of there weren't good games for it And then the good games came out.

191
00:12:45,536 --> 00:12:50,140
Speaker 0: the Wii Did really well right away because of Wii Sports and there weren't too many other great games.

192
00:12:50,722 --> 00:12:56,150
Speaker 0: The Wii is still doing really really great and selling out because of Wii Sports Which is great for most people.

193
00:12:56,211 --> 00:12:57,539
Speaker 0: but people like us.

194
00:12:58,182 --> 00:13:03,440
Speaker 0: I haven't even touched the Wii in months because the best game on it is still WarioWare for the Gamecube.

195
00:13:03,761 --> 00:13:04,362
Speaker 1: Well, it's not the.

196
00:13:04,463 --> 00:13:13,620
Speaker 1: if you're gonna do it that way then the best game for it is probably I don't know Pac-man first Pac-man first like four swords or something like that.

197
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,538
Speaker 0: But but the DS had some hard-hitting games coming out because.

198
00:13:17,558 --> 00:13:27,520
Speaker 0: well I don't know if it was because but I would assume it was because that was how to sell it the moment It wasn't selling so well You got to do something to get people to want of DS and now everyone wants a DS.

199
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,814
Speaker 1: Well, I think the big difference is that when Nintendo was coming with the DS, right?

200
00:13:32,296 --> 00:13:33,640
Speaker 1: Everyone was super skeptical.

201
00:13:34,003 --> 00:13:38,492
Speaker 1: They were like, there's no way What's his third pillar shit?

202
00:13:38,672 --> 00:13:39,456
Speaker 0: I was gonna have to kill.

203
00:13:39,637 --> 00:13:40,220
Speaker 1: I was skeptical.

204
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,205
Speaker 1: I was like at work.

205
00:13:41,828 --> 00:13:48,800
Speaker 1: I said when I bought the DS at worst This is gonna be another virtual boy and at best it'll be awesome.

206
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:55,280
Speaker 1: So I can't lose by buying it because at the worst I own the virtual boy, which I wouldn't mind doing so.

207
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:57,429
Speaker 1: Everyone was skeptical of the DS.

208
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,820
Speaker 1: so not too many people ran out and bought it right away.

209
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, we did for no good reason.

210
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't even have a podcast back then.

211
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,887
Speaker 0: It's not like we were gonna review.

212
00:14:05,028 --> 00:14:09,027
Speaker 1: I did for the reason I just said at worst It was gonna be virtual boy, and I wanted one.

213
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:12,520
Speaker 1: so it came out and there weren't so many good games right away.

214
00:14:12,781 --> 00:14:15,900
Speaker 1: But I basically bought every game that might have been good for it.

215
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,014
Speaker 1: I've got a lot of DS games now and they're all.

216
00:14:19,395 --> 00:14:26,820
Speaker 0: most of them are really good But the Wii I think partly everyone who was skeptical of the DS thought All right, I learned my lesson never doubt Nintendo.

217
00:14:27,022 --> 00:14:28,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Wii is gonna be hot shit.

218
00:14:28,362 --> 00:14:28,859
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

219
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:34,044
Speaker 1: by the time the Wii came around the DS had already proven itself and people were like Oh the DS.

220
00:14:34,064 --> 00:14:35,790
Speaker 1: we were skeptical of that and it was awesome.

221
00:14:36,051 --> 00:14:36,954
Speaker 1: And now here's the Wii.

222
00:14:37,415 --> 00:14:38,920
Speaker 1: Oh, no reason to be skeptical anymore.

223
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,487
Speaker 1: It's gonna be as awesome as the DS.

224
00:14:40,748 --> 00:14:49,642
Speaker 0: and I think the Wii is selling solely Solely on the merit of its potential because it currently doesn't have the merit to justify the sales It has.

225
00:14:49,803 --> 00:14:53,540
Speaker 1: is is the Wii is a pile of unfulfilled potential.

226
00:14:53,720 --> 00:15:02,068
Speaker 0: However, if the DS is any indication that potential will eventually be met I imagine it will be met within 12 months.

227
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:11,040
Speaker 0: and I think if all 12 months when all these games come out because these are All the games that I'm personally waiting for these are games that a lot of people are personally waiting for.

228
00:15:11,341 --> 00:15:16,300
Speaker 0: They didn't wait to buy a Wii to get these games, which is great for Nintendo because you got your money early.

229
00:15:16,823 --> 00:15:22,709
Speaker 0: But I think when these games come out in the end of this year There's gonna be a huge surge in Wii playing suddenly.

230
00:15:23,191 --> 00:15:24,856
Speaker 1: It's gonna be quite insane.

231
00:15:24,876 --> 00:15:26,280
Speaker 0: I mean I smash brothers?

232
00:15:26,461 --> 00:15:30,293
Speaker 1: Yeah, and until then the Pokemons and the DS will hold everyone over.

233
00:15:30,754 --> 00:15:31,055
Speaker 0: Yeah.

234
00:15:31,336 --> 00:15:32,500
Speaker 0: Good God the Pokemons.

235
00:15:32,814 --> 00:15:48,949
Speaker 0: Yeah all I have to say about that is I had never played a Pokemon game until this one and I'm glad I didn't because if I had played a Pokemon game when I was young and I had infinite free time coupled with zero Responsibility and infinite boredom, I'd be fucked now.

236
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:52,158
Speaker 0: I would have known everything about Pokemon and I wouldn't have known calculus.

237
00:15:52,358 --> 00:15:55,127
Speaker 1: Yeah Possibly what a good thing.

238
00:15:55,147 --> 00:16:09,325
Speaker 0: the Pokemons didn't come out until like I was already in high school and stuff, but Particularly the Smash Brothers brawl because the GameCube was as far as I was concerned nothing until Smash Brothers came out and basically One Smash Brothers came out.

239
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:13,278
Speaker 0: the GameCube became a Smash Brothers machine for like six months.

240
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:15,799
Speaker 0: Yep I mean we played it every day.

241
00:16:16,281 --> 00:16:17,144
Speaker 0: Everyone did.

242
00:16:17,164 --> 00:16:19,490
Speaker 0: yep, and this one's gonna be better.

243
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:20,393
Speaker 0: I'm certain of it.

244
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:22,720
Speaker 0: I'm so looking forward to this game.

245
00:16:23,765 --> 00:16:25,997
Speaker 1: Yeah, one last thing about that Miyamoto interview.

246
00:16:26,037 --> 00:16:29,571
Speaker 1: in that interview He mentions Def Con which I think is pretty cool.

247
00:16:29,611 --> 00:16:31,919
Speaker 1: that Miyamoto knows about Def Con and respects it.

248
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:44,020
Speaker 0: actually Iwata made a really interesting point about Second Life and he basically said that he has no interest in it and He kind of gives the impression that he thinks it's dumb and that no one will remember it in a fairly short order.

249
00:16:44,441 --> 00:16:58,040
Speaker 0: Hmm and a lot of people are speculating that this might be him indirectly saying that he thinks MMOs are garbage Which means there's probably never going to be a Pokemon MMO Probably which is possibly a good thing for the world.

250
00:16:58,702 --> 00:17:12,400
Speaker 0: But I really think that as much as I dislike MMOs just for the the bare nature of what they are I will not deny that a Pokemon MMO would probably make more money than you can possibly imagine.

251
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,905
Speaker 0: It would probably be the like.

252
00:17:14,006 --> 00:17:18,000
Speaker 1: it would one of the few possible ways to beat World of Warcraft right now.

253
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,164
Speaker 1: It'd be a Pokemon MMO

254
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:22,757
Speaker 0: because I know a lot of people who would play a Pokemon MMO

255
00:17:22,837 --> 00:17:30,408
Speaker 1: like a giant multi-continent world where everyone walks around catching Pokemon Training them and then fighting each other where you

256
00:17:30,568 --> 00:17:39,699
Speaker 0: upload all the Pokemon you have from all your Pokemon games to the Nintendo server and your Pokemon are now guaranteed and taken care of forever and

257
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:51,875
Speaker 1: like every they give you can play this MMO with their DS or your Wii or your PC or your cell phone or Whatever and you can even like buy collectible cards and they'll interact with the MMO.

258
00:17:52,276 --> 00:17:53,600
Speaker 1: It would be the king of kings.

259
00:17:54,222 --> 00:18:02,619
Speaker 1: Everything they tried to do with stuff like hack sign or that new thing that guy keeps trying to market to us will actually Succeed if Pokemon does it.

260
00:18:03,122 --> 00:18:13,260
Speaker 0: I mean if I even if I didn't have venture capital or anything I would stake pretty much everything I own all of my fiscal assets on the success of a Pokemon MMO.

261
00:18:13,581 --> 00:18:26,569
Speaker 0: I would also like without even a hesitation no hesitate Things of the day right along with the main bit here.

262
00:18:27,112 --> 00:18:33,280
Speaker 0: my thing of the day is a video that I found when I was looking for some video footage of rescue the embassy mission.

263
00:18:33,744 --> 00:18:45,612
Speaker 0: that contains footage from rescue the embassy mission and Golgo 13 for the NES and it's basically one of those silly music videos and they make the characters dance and it's kind of Funny.

264
00:18:46,178 --> 00:18:47,429
Speaker 0: and that's all I got to say about it.

265
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:51,266
Speaker 1: Yeah, rim found this video and I was like, ah, it looks like some random YouTube crap.

266
00:18:51,306 --> 00:18:52,090
Speaker 1: and then we watched it.

267
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:52,411
Speaker 1: It was.

268
00:18:52,451 --> 00:18:54,198
Speaker 1: it was actually slightly amusing.

269
00:18:54,379 --> 00:19:02,810
Speaker 0: I mean, it was pretty dumb at first and I thought all right Is this just some guy playing a song he likes while he plays this game and then right away?

270
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:06,789
Speaker 0: The one guy does this little dance and then I realized exactly what was going on.

271
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:07,673
Speaker 1: Yeah, it.

272
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:14,489
Speaker 1: I don't think it's the greatest video, but it's great because it meets it beats expectations Which is why it's worth being a thing of the day.

273
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:21,118
Speaker 0: Yes, also in case you don't want to get a hold of the ROM or actually play this game You can see exactly what this game is all about.

274
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:21,780
Speaker 1: Yep.

275
00:19:22,401 --> 00:19:22,742
Speaker 1: All right.

276
00:19:22,803 --> 00:19:24,347
Speaker 1: So a while ago.

277
00:19:24,427 --> 00:19:25,290
Speaker 1: I did a thing of the day.

278
00:19:25,918 --> 00:19:34,050

Speaker 0: Are any of on the DS?

291
00:20:30,884 --> 00:20:32,494
Speaker 1: I don't think so I don't know.

292
00:20:32,514 --> 00:20:35,190
Speaker 1: I think they're mostly talking about PC ones that you can down.

293
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:43,916
Speaker 0: Ah, it's still to me one of the greatest crimes that no one has gotten a license to take all of those quest for glory whatever games and Put them on the DS.

294
00:20:44,137 --> 00:20:46,410
Speaker 1: Well, I mean there are some point-and-click adventures to the DS.

295
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,679
Speaker 1: I mean you got your Phoenix right which is sort of like that.

296
00:20:48,719 --> 00:20:49,462
Speaker 1: You've got your.

297
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:51,470
Speaker 1: what's that are the lost in blue type stuff?

298
00:20:51,591 --> 00:20:52,961
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they're they're really different.

299
00:20:52,981 --> 00:20:54,150
Speaker 0: They're not the same kind of game?

300
00:20:54,371 --> 00:20:56,861
Speaker 0: No, they're not and I see no reason not to port them.

301
00:20:57,162 --> 00:20:59,130
Speaker 0: Those games would definitely fit on a DS cart.

302
00:20:59,533 --> 00:21:00,522
Speaker 0: They do super well.

303
00:21:00,562 --> 00:21:01,369
Speaker 0: I'm almost sure of it.

304
00:21:01,638 --> 00:21:11,980
Speaker 1: Yeah I don't understand why people like they always concentrate on making like new crap games and they're just Already existing easily ported games that can sell a lot.

305
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:14,006
Speaker 1: It's like why do they just don't?

306
00:21:14,547 --> 00:21:15,630
Speaker 1: uh, I don't know.

307
00:21:15,911 --> 00:21:20,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway game publishers just aren't thinking but and yet we can't get a dev kit and do it ourselves.

308
00:21:21,091 --> 00:21:24,982
Speaker 1: No, if you like point-and-click adventures, here you go.

309
00:21:25,002 --> 00:21:27,369
Speaker 1: This is what you have to look forward to in the year to come.

310
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:28,509
Speaker 1: Have fun.

311
00:21:28,951 --> 00:21:40,370
Speaker 0: So back when I was a kid one of the many many Nintendo games that I owned and/or rented Was rescue the embassy mission rescue colon the embassy mission.

312
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:44,224
Speaker 1: The game was called just rescue but you know, the subtext was the embassy mission.

313
00:21:44,445 --> 00:21:53,030
Speaker 1: Yes released in 1990 by Kemco the same people who did shadow gate and deja vu deja vu to ha how about that?

314
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:53,430
Speaker 1: Yep.

315
00:21:53,973 --> 00:21:57,125
Speaker 0: Now for some reason we were reminded of this game recently.

316
00:21:57,145 --> 00:21:58,811
Speaker 0: I don't even really remember Why.

317
00:21:58,871 --> 00:22:08,780
Speaker 0: I think it's because I often go off and hum the the song doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

318
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:16,184
Speaker 1: get the ticket ticket ticket ticket ticket ticket ticket ticket Gets crazier as you get into a more dangerous situation when you're in a less dangerous situation.

319
00:22:16,224 --> 00:22:18,229
Speaker 1: It just goes doo doo doo doo.

320
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:28,790
Speaker 0: there's only one other song that really infiltrates our consciousness like that and that's the song from doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

321
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:33,890
Speaker 1: Because I was humming the song as I often do we were reminded of risky embassy mission.

322
00:22:33,932 --> 00:22:40,070
Speaker 1: He said hey Let's do a random show In an old NES game that you can really only play if you get the rom or get the cartridge.

323
00:22:40,371 --> 00:22:45,870
Speaker 0: It's kind of a unique game, and I'm surprised that no one has ever tried to remake this game on another console.

324
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:46,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, alright.

325
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:55,130
Speaker 1: This is a game in which you are a team of, what, like SWAT guys, or SEALs, or some sort of military strike force.

326
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,490
Speaker 1: Think, uh, Section 9, Ghost in the Shell type of thing.

327
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,989
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're basically just the SWAT team.

328
00:22:59,170 --> 00:22:59,239
Speaker 0: Yep.

329
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,270
Speaker 0: There's an embassy.

330
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,073
Speaker 1: There's an embassy.

331
00:23:01,294 --> 00:23:02,901
Speaker 1: It's in- it's in- it's in town.

332
00:23:03,061 --> 00:23:03,925
Speaker 1: The embassy in town.

333
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,030
Speaker 1: Who knows what country it's for.

334
00:23:05,531 --> 00:23:06,809
Speaker 0: Ono is terrorists.

335
00:23:07,211 --> 00:23:08,135
Speaker 1: Ono is terrorists.

336
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:09,561
Speaker 1: They have taken over the embassy.

337
00:23:09,923 --> 00:23:11,750
Speaker 1: They are holding all the ambassadors hostage.

338
00:23:12,233 --> 00:23:13,590
Speaker 1: You have to rescue the ambassadors.

339
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,630
Speaker 0: Are you a bad enough dude to rescue the hostages?

340
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:20,670
Speaker 1: You have to rescue the hostages, and kill all the terrorists, and then you win.

341
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:24,607
Speaker 1: And you've only got so many minutes to do this because there's a bomb or something?

342
00:23:24,727 --> 00:23:25,310
Speaker 1: I have no idea.

343
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:31,110
Speaker 0: I think that's just when diplomatic relations break down, or they kill the hostages, or... It doesn't really matter.

344
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,398
Speaker 1: You only have, like, 10, 15- you don't have much time to save these hostages.

345
00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:36,211
Speaker 0: You're very- The SWAT is pretty flimsy.

346
00:23:36,231 --> 00:23:37,280
Speaker 0: Don't even worry about it.

347
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:37,520
Speaker 0: Yes.

348
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,840
Speaker 1: So, what do you do to rescue these hostages?

349
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,579
Speaker 0: Well, see, here's what makes the game really unique.

350
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,720
Speaker 0: In that, one, for a Nintendo game, it was far more complex than most other Nintendo games of the time.

351
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:52,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was- but it was really short, you know, so it was like a really complex, but really condensed.

352
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:59,640
Speaker 0: Basically, they came up with these four different games that in and of themselves were not a whole game.

353
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,440
Speaker 0: Like, they wouldn't have been worth buying a cartridge for, but they were really fun.

354
00:24:03,561 --> 00:24:05,213
Speaker 0: At least, most of them were kind of fun.

355
00:24:05,293 --> 00:24:06,180
Speaker 0: One of them was super fun.

356
00:24:06,382 --> 00:24:07,079
Speaker 1: One of them is stupid.

357
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, one of them is pretty stupid, but it was also awesome because of how I learned how to do it.

358
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:13,337
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.

359
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:18,880
Speaker 0: But, they combined them all together, and the game basically goes through four phases.

360
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:25,800
Speaker 0: And each phase is basically a separate game, but each one is contingent on the previous one in some way.

361
00:24:26,141 --> 00:24:35,960
Speaker 1: Yep, the phases actually affect each other, and it feels like you're controlling this entire team, executing every part of an actual mission to actually rescue ambassadors.

362
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:40,820
Speaker 0: Now, there have been games that have done the FPS part of this game that have been very similar.

363
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,199
Speaker 0: I mean, Counter-Strike even is a lot like this in some ways.

364
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:49,220
Speaker 1: Yep, but Counter-Strike doesn't have the first three parts that are nothing like the part that is like Counter-Strike.

365
00:24:49,441 --> 00:24:57,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, now I'm not going to pretend that the whole game is great, because the last part kind of sucks, the third part...

366
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:57,938
Speaker 1: Really sucks.

367
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,320
Speaker 0: ...is awesome because it's hilarious, but it's not good.

368
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,360
Speaker 1: No, the first part is awesome, and the second part is okay.

369
00:25:04,941 --> 00:25:09,440
Speaker 0: I would love for someone to make a game that was just the first part and was really long.

370
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would also love that.

371
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,099
Speaker 1: It would also be fucking impossible.

372
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:18,233
Speaker 0: So basically, you control the four phases of the game, and the first phase is you've got three snipers.

373
00:25:19,215 --> 00:25:20,618
Speaker 0: Jumbo, Kemko...

374
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,219
Speaker 1: I think it's Jumbo, Mike, and someone else.

375
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,165
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, right.

376
00:25:24,226 --> 00:25:25,336
Speaker 0: Kemko is in the second half.

377
00:25:25,417 --> 00:25:25,760
Speaker 0: Doesn't matter.

378
00:25:26,201 --> 00:25:27,580
Speaker 0: So you've got these guys, these three.

379
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,047
Speaker 1: And they have to get in position to snipe.

380
00:25:30,308 --> 00:25:34,100
Speaker 1: They're just standing around, you know, like by the squad car or whatever they're near.

381
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:39,580
Speaker 1: And they need to get into sniping position on the three sides of the building that face the street.

382
00:25:40,223 --> 00:25:44,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, the game actually gives you this fun interface where it shows the blueprints of the building and the area around it.

383
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:55,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically it's a street that's in the shape of a U, and the embassy is in the middle of the U, so it's surrounded on three sides by street and one side by other buildings.

384
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:08,260
Speaker 1: So you have to get a sniper basically into a hiding position on each of the three sides of the embassy that are facing the street so that you can shoot into the embassy to kill a terrorist.

385
00:26:08,642 --> 00:26:11,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it gives you this fun interface where it shows you the blueprint and everything.

386
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:18,078
Speaker 0: And it doesn't really matter, you don't really have control, but you pick like, "Alright, I'm gonna send the three snipers

387
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:18,279
Speaker 0: out.".

388
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:26,879
Speaker 0: "Alright, now I'm gonna send Kemko to repel down the thing, I'm gonna snipe with Jumbo, I'm gonna do this and this and

389
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:27,059
Speaker 0: this.".

390
00:26:27,581 --> 00:26:30,120
Speaker 0: And it's kind of like you're the commander of this SWAT team operation.

391
00:26:31,042 --> 00:26:33,399
Speaker 1: So in this first part where you get the snipers in position...

392
00:26:33,541 --> 00:26:34,620
Speaker 0: Which is pretty much the whole game.

393
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:42,420
Speaker 1: Which is pretty much the whole game, is really cool because it's a side-scrolling stealth game, sort of like Metal Gear, not really.

394
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:47,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, you've got your dude, and there's searchlights from the terrorists in the embassy, and they're going around.

395
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:53,760
Speaker 1: And if the searchlights see your sniper walking down the street, they're gonna shoot him and kill him, and there's nothing he can do about it.

396
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,623
Speaker 0: Well, they might not kill him.

397
00:26:54,643 --> 00:26:58,920
Speaker 0: The thing is, if you get spotted by the searchlights, they open fire.

398
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:06,301
Speaker 0: And depending on what you're doing, or who it is shooting, the odds of getting hit are pretty high, but they're not 100%.

399
00:27:06,301 --> 00:27:08,930
Speaker 1: It's not 100%, but you're usually gonna get killed.

400
00:27:09,131 --> 00:27:11,580
Speaker 1: The idea is to avoid the searchlights, and then you win.

401
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:18,060
Speaker 0: So you've gotta slowly make your way down the street to get to a building where you can then have a sniper position without getting shot.

402
00:27:18,321 --> 00:27:18,481
Speaker 0: Yep.

403
00:27:18,902 --> 00:27:20,346
Speaker 1: So you walk from left to right.

404
00:27:20,567 --> 00:27:22,673
Speaker 1: But, so, is that interesting?

405
00:27:22,693 --> 00:27:25,120
Speaker 1: You just walk from left to right, avoiding lights.

406
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,688
Speaker 1: That's just the timing of walking.

407
00:27:26,748 --> 00:27:27,029
Speaker 1: No.

408
00:27:27,532 --> 00:27:28,960
Speaker 1: There's more interesting things to it.

409
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:38,740
Speaker 0: You see, despite the fact that it's an NES game, and the biggest problem with a lot of early NES games was if you wanted to do anything complicated, there were only two buttons and the D-pad.

410
00:27:39,243 --> 00:27:39,380
Speaker 0: Yep.

411
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,210
Speaker 0: And Start and Select you really couldn't use for gameplay stuff.

412
00:27:42,611 --> 00:27:45,060
Speaker 0: Very few games use those buttons for gameplay stuff.

413
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:45,426
Speaker 0: Mhm.

414
00:27:46,101 --> 00:27:58,480
Speaker 0: So, games had to do stupid tricks like, alright, hit A or B to do two different things, and hit A and B at the same time to do something else, or hold up and B or up or whatever, and it usually was very clunky and difficult to use.

415
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,808
Speaker 0: But in this game, the control scheme is fairly elegant, and yet, you have a lot of options.

416
00:28:04,068 --> 00:28:11,540
Speaker 0: You can walk, you can dive, you can jump behind things, you can roll, you can duck down and crawl.

417
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:16,691
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can get in a prone position and shimmy along the ground in two different directions.

418
00:28:17,212 --> 00:28:21,220
Speaker 1: I think the reason that this was actually able to do this is because there's no shooting.

419
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:27,137
Speaker 1: Now you have both buttons used only for movement maneuvers, and there's nothing to shoot.

420
00:28:27,177 --> 00:28:28,080
Speaker 1: You're just trying to dodge.

421
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,033
Speaker 1: So one button is roll, and one button is jump behind stuff.

422
00:28:32,053 --> 00:28:33,720
Speaker 1: Well, up is jump behind stuff, right?

423
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:33,946
Speaker 1: Yep.

424
00:28:34,982 --> 00:28:36,248
Speaker 1: You can do all sorts of things.

425
00:28:36,268 --> 00:28:38,620
Speaker 1: You can end up and duck, do different things.

426
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:50,080
Speaker 0: And I gotta say, as a kid playing this game, my nerves were shot anytime I played, because this game, nowadays, I don't care, like whatever, but when I was a kid, it's kind of like how Castlevania 2 was really creepy to me.

427
00:28:50,520 --> 00:29:01,500
Speaker 0: Playing this game and trying to avoid those searchlights, you get really freaking nervous, because you see, alright, the next place I can hide, because you can always, if you can get into a little building, or behind a bush or something, you're safe.

428
00:29:02,001 --> 00:29:03,964
Speaker 0: But there's not always something to jump behind.

429
00:29:04,545 --> 00:29:07,951
Speaker 0: So it'd be like, you go, go, go, go, go, go, ah, safe.

430
00:29:09,474 --> 00:29:10,896
Speaker 0: And you can sit there as long as you want.

431
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,940
Speaker 0: The timer keeps ticking down, but you have like 15 minutes.

432
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,601
Speaker 0: 15 minutes.

433
00:29:14,601 --> 00:29:16,123
Speaker 1: 15 minutes for the whole game.

434
00:29:16,183 --> 00:29:21,030
Speaker 1: The more time you waste putting snipers in position is less time for sniping.

435
00:29:21,911 --> 00:29:28,460
Speaker 1: Let's say you get all the snipers in position, and then you do all your sniping, and then you get in the building, and you've got a minute left.

436
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,391
Speaker 1: Now you've got a minute to kill all the remaining terrorists and rescue the hostages.

437
00:29:31,712 --> 00:29:32,154
Speaker 1: Guess what?

438
00:29:32,194 --> 00:29:33,760
Speaker 1: It's not going to happen, because you took too long.

439
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,260
Speaker 0: Yep.

440
00:29:34,741 --> 00:29:45,660
Speaker 0: So there was always, I'd get safe, and then I'd sit there, and it took such a mental effort to force myself to pull the character out of the safe spot and run past the next gauntlet of searchlights.

441
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,040
Speaker 0: Yep.

442
00:29:46,441 --> 00:29:48,744
Speaker 1: So you try to get these three snipers in position.

443
00:29:48,824 --> 00:29:50,567
Speaker 1: Getting the first one in position is pretty easy.

444
00:29:50,887 --> 00:29:53,431
Speaker 1: Getting the second one in position is kinda, sorta easy.

445
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:59,800
Speaker 1: Getting the third one in position is really hard, because he has to go really far, and he has to go into a lot of tricky situations.

446
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:10,135
Speaker 0: Until I watched a video of the completion of this game in an optimal manner, I had never seen the end of the sniper guy path.

447
00:30:10,515 --> 00:30:12,278
Speaker 0: I had never gotten Jumbo to the end.

448
00:30:12,618 --> 00:30:13,820
Speaker 0: Jumbo had never survived.

449
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:18,987
Speaker 1: Now keep in mind that this game has many, many different difficulty selections.

450
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:28,760
Speaker 1: You can set this game anywhere from stupidly easy to impossibly ludicrously hard, and the game changes drastically depending on which setting you choose.

451
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:34,389
Speaker 1: And there's a lot of in-between settings, so you can work your way up slowly to actually beating the impossibly hard mode.

452
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:34,950
Speaker 1: Yeah.

453
00:30:35,191 --> 00:30:38,256
Speaker 1: But even on the impossibly easy mode, I never got Jumbo over there.

454
00:30:38,276 --> 00:30:40,500
Speaker 1: That's how tricky this game is.

455
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:46,409
Speaker 0: Now, what always bothered me was that, why didn't they just take the back door to whatever building they're gonna snipe?

456
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:47,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

457
00:30:47,271 --> 00:30:48,072
Speaker 1: I don't know.

458
00:30:48,372 --> 00:30:49,614
Speaker 0: I guess there's only one street in the world.

459
00:30:49,634 --> 00:30:53,260
Speaker 1: And the game wouldn't be fun, because the most fun part of the game wouldn't happen.

460
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,543
Speaker 0: The really cool thing too is that there aren't lives or anything.

461
00:30:57,884 --> 00:31:02,308
Speaker 0: You just have three snipers, three guys who bust into the building, and that's it.

462
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:05,051
Speaker 0: And if a sniper dies, he's dead.

463
00:31:05,371 --> 00:31:05,851
Speaker 0: That's it.

464
00:31:06,352 --> 00:31:07,273
Speaker 0: Use the next sniper.

465
00:31:07,873 --> 00:31:10,015
Speaker 0: And you don't have to get all three snipers in position.

466
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,497
Speaker 1: You don't have to get any of the snipers in position.

467
00:31:11,517 --> 00:31:12,498
Speaker 0: No, you have to get at least one.

468
00:31:12,518 --> 00:31:13,399
Speaker 1: You have to get at least one?

469
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:14,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm pretty sure you have to get at least one.

470
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,622
Speaker 1: Well, let's say you only get two snipers in position.

471
00:31:17,662 --> 00:31:21,786
Speaker 1: Well, let's say I get the one for the left side of the building and the one for the north side of the building.

472
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:25,129
Speaker 1: I'm just not gonna be able to snipe on the east side of the building.

473
00:31:25,449 --> 00:31:27,971
Speaker 0: Yeah, there might be terrorists over there, and I can't kill them this way.

474
00:31:27,991 --> 00:31:29,152
Speaker 0: Now I gotta kill them the hard way.

475
00:31:29,312 --> 00:31:31,974
Speaker 1: Actually, I think it's technically northwest and south, but you get my point.

476
00:31:32,094 --> 00:31:32,295
Speaker 0: Yeah.

477
00:31:32,555 --> 00:31:38,600
Speaker 1: If I get two snipers in position, I can snipe two sides of the building, and the third side of the building goes unsniped.

478
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:48,429
Speaker 0: Now, while it's fairly primitive, it does something that so few games do, partly because it's hard to do, and partly because it's not worth the effort to do, because most people wouldn't care.

479
00:31:48,849 --> 00:31:54,774
Speaker 0: But I love the idea of a game where succeeding at the mission, you continue.

480
00:31:55,315 --> 00:31:57,417
Speaker 0: Failing at the mission does not end the game.

481
00:31:57,717 --> 00:32:01,100
Speaker 0: The game continues with the ramifications of having failed that mission.

482
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:09,006
Speaker 0: Imagine a game like Advance Wars, where if you lose a battle to, say, take a port, now the war continues, but you don't have that port.

483
00:32:09,366 --> 00:32:09,566
Speaker 1: Yep.

484
00:32:09,866 --> 00:32:17,612
Speaker 0: No games really do that, but this game kinda does in a really primitive way, where if only one sniper made it, you've only got one fucking sniper now.

485
00:32:18,032 --> 00:32:22,716
Speaker 1: Yep, but at least if those other snipers die really quickly, then you'll still have a lot of time.

486
00:32:22,736 --> 00:32:28,620
Speaker 0: I would usually just kill Jumbo, because it wasn't worth just spending all that time only to die.

487
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:32,631
Speaker 1: Yep, because remember, the whole game only takes, like, 15 minutes, and then you're done.

488
00:32:32,711 --> 00:32:35,840
Speaker 1: I think actually in the harder modes, you have less time to do the whole game.

489
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:43,550
Speaker 0: Now the best part, and I want to point this out, on the screen where you pick guys, whenever it shows a guy, one of the snipers, it's like the blueprint map, right?

490
00:32:43,991 --> 00:32:50,119
Speaker 0: The guy's little avatar is, like, popping up and down, bursting through the paper, and it's really, really funny.

491
00:32:50,379 --> 00:32:50,880
Speaker 1: It is pretty funny.

492
00:32:52,585 --> 00:32:52,745
Speaker 0: Yep.

493
00:32:53,047 --> 00:32:54,553
Speaker 1: So, you get the snipers in position.

494
00:32:54,593 --> 00:32:54,995
Speaker 1: Now what?

495
00:32:55,196 --> 00:32:56,100
Speaker 1: Obviously, you snipe!

496
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:08,140
Speaker 0: Sniping is frustrating, and frustrating, but at the same time, it's really not that bad, because a lot of other games, like Golgo 13, tried to do sniping on the NES, and it was ass!

497
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:18,780
Speaker 1: Basically, all you do is you have this circle, and you move this circle, you can look at one side of the building, depending on which sniper you're using, you know, so, and you can switch between all the snipers at will.

498
00:33:19,141 --> 00:33:22,706
Speaker 1: So if you have all three snipers in position, you can say, "I want to snipe with that sniper now.

499
00:33:23,227 --> 00:33:24,749
Speaker 1: Ah, forget that, I want to snipe with this sniper

500
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:24,889
Speaker 1: now.".

501
00:33:25,149 --> 00:33:26,852
Speaker 1: And you can just snipe to your heart's content.

502
00:33:27,233 --> 00:33:32,160
Speaker 1: But every second you spend sniping is the second you're spending not beating the game.

503
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:32,920
Speaker 0: Yep.

504
00:33:33,322 --> 00:33:38,298
Speaker 0: And I'd always have this debate where, "How long was I going to sit there waiting for someone to walk by a window and blow them

505
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:38,619
Speaker 0: away?".

506
00:33:38,921 --> 00:33:39,081
Speaker 0: Yep.

507
00:33:39,403 --> 00:33:45,080
Speaker 1: So when you snipe, basically you look at one side of the building, depending on which sniper you're using, And you can look at any window, and there's, like, nine windows.

508
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:51,140
Speaker 1: And all you do is you have this targeting reticle, and you move it around, and there's nine windows in each side of the building, or twelve?

509
00:33:51,481 --> 00:33:52,699
Speaker 0: I don't remember, I think it's nine.

510
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,461
Speaker 1: I think it's nine.

511
00:33:54,002 --> 00:33:56,907
Speaker 1: And you look in the windows, and if you shoot a window, it breaks.

512
00:33:57,548 --> 00:34:00,092
Speaker 1: And if you see a shadow in the window, you shoot it.

513
00:34:00,633 --> 00:34:04,400
Speaker 1: And if you shoot and successfully hit that guy in the window, he dies.

514
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:11,300
Speaker 0: And they simulate, you know, it's difficult to snipe, but the cursor kind of moves around a lot, really annoying, but it's not super annoying.

515
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:21,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not like those games where it just flies around the screen and you can't control it, but the targeting reticle will move a little bit on its own, and sometimes you'll miss the guy you're trying to shoot because of it.

516
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:28,500
Speaker 0: Now, the thing I really liked was that the guys walk around, the terrorists walk around dynamically, and they could come anywhere, it's kind of random.

517
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:36,860
Speaker 0: The thing that was hilarious was, sometimes you see a guy, like, peek out a window and walk away, and then he comes back, and you shoot, and say you miss, and you've shattered the window now.

518
00:34:37,581 --> 00:34:40,080
Speaker 0: He'll probably just come back and look out the window again.

519
00:34:40,241 --> 00:34:43,239
Speaker 1: Yeah, the movement of the guys in the building is sort of random.

520
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,281
Speaker 0: The terrorists are stupid!

521
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:55,960
Speaker 0: You can shoot four guys in a window, and there's obviously a pile of four dead bodies behind that window, and a fifth terrorist will walk over, "Huh, I wonder what happened here," and just poke his head out the window.

522
00:34:56,141 --> 00:34:58,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, sometimes that'll happen, sometimes it won't, it's kind of random.

523
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:09,980
Speaker 1: Generally what I do is I do each sniper that I have available, I'll check out each window for maybe ten seconds each, something like that, five seconds each, just to make sure.

524
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:16,860
Speaker 1: Then after I've checked all the windows, I'll scan them all once more really quickly to make sure there isn't an easy kill, then I'll go to the next sniper.

525
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:23,260
Speaker 1: Because sniping, all it really does is make the final part of the game easier for you, because there'll be less guys.

526
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,407
Speaker 1: Every guy you kill sniping is a guy.

527
00:35:25,427 --> 00:35:29,120
Speaker 1: you don't have to kill walking around inside the building with your assault rifle.

528
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:33,720
Speaker 0: Now, the third part of the game- The bad part of the game.

529
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,438
Speaker 1: I think it's cool, but I want to present- It's cool, but it sucks.

530
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,517
Speaker 0: The third part of the game, from the eyes of a kid, Rim.

531
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:41,120
Speaker 0: Little Rim.

532
00:35:41,384 --> 00:35:41,620
Speaker 1: Alright.

533
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,564
Speaker 0: Who got this game?

534
00:35:42,584 --> 00:35:44,030
Speaker 0: from Blockbuster, he rented it.

535
00:35:44,071 --> 00:35:46,080
Speaker 0: It might have been Mammoth Video, I don't even remember.

536
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:51,080
Speaker 1: I don't remember where I played this, but I played it, and I remember seeing it in a video game magazine, but I definitely did not own it.

537
00:35:51,381 --> 00:35:55,120
Speaker 0: So I got this game, never played it before, didn't have an instruction book.

538
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,498
Speaker 0: And I get to this part of the game, where I pick one of my guys, and I say, "Alright, go

539
00:35:59,659 --> 00:35:59,699
Speaker 0: in."

540
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:03,040
Speaker 0: And I pick which side of the building and which row of windows I want.

541
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,165
Speaker 1: Yep, because that's what you do.

542
00:36:04,185 --> 00:36:06,420
Speaker 1: You have a guy on the roof, and he needs to get in the building.

543
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:10,880
Speaker 1: So he's going to rappel down the side of the building, and crash through one of the windows.

544
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:18,260
Speaker 0: So it shows me my guy hanging just over the roof, like just down the side of the building, from a rope, like he's going to rappel.

545
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,887
Speaker 0: Alright, and it doesn't say what to do.

546
00:36:21,409 --> 00:36:24,440
Speaker 0: So I hit A, and my guy swings out, and swings back in.

547
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,540
Speaker 1: He basically kicks off the side of the building.

548
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,140
Speaker 0: And then lands back on the exact same spot.

549
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,679
Speaker 1: And then swings back, and he's leaning against the building again.

550
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:31,699
Speaker 0: On the exact same spot.

551
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:31,969
Speaker 0: Yep.

552
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,665
Speaker 0: So I'm like, "Alright, that's what that button

553
00:36:33,685 --> 00:36:33,885
Speaker 0: does.".

554
00:36:34,347 --> 00:36:38,280
Speaker 0: So then I hit down, and he moves down a few inches, and then falls to his death.

555
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,099
Speaker 1: Yeah, he just lets go of the rope and dies.

556
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:40,941
Speaker 0: Shit.

557
00:36:41,223 --> 00:36:44,540
Speaker 0: So I take my second guy, and I hit down, and he falls to his death.

558
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,080
Speaker 0: Third guy, falls to his death, game over.

559
00:36:47,521 --> 00:36:57,278
Speaker 1: It's really annoying, because all you should have to do with this part of the game is hold down, to move down, to the part of the window you want to- That's not how rappelling works.

560
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,040
Speaker 1: I know, but that's how it should work in a video game.

561
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,928
Speaker 0: No, because in the video game, it's kind of cool.

562
00:37:01,968 --> 00:37:04,360
Speaker 0: I think in this part, it suffers from being too simple.

563
00:37:04,821 --> 00:37:06,399
Speaker 0: They could have made it more complex and cool.

564
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,473
Speaker 1: Eh, I think it's just, the part of it is not obvious, and it's too finicky.

565
00:37:11,754 --> 00:37:13,620
Speaker 1: It's not like an exact precise control.

566
00:37:13,961 --> 00:37:18,060
Speaker 0: You have to kind of rock down up, down up, down up, and slowly murk your way down.

567
00:37:18,621 --> 00:37:19,946
Speaker 0: And you can pick which window.

568
00:37:19,986 --> 00:37:23,640
Speaker 0: You can go in the third floor- third floor- the third floor or the second floor.

569
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,894
Speaker 0: What I learned as a kid is that you cannot make it to the first floor.

570
00:37:27,934 --> 00:37:29,600
Speaker 0: The rope's not long enough, and it just breaks.

571
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:30,080
Speaker 1: Yep.

572
00:37:30,422 --> 00:37:35,120
Speaker 1: So basically, you push down, and before you fall to your death, you push up, and your guy will lean against the building.

573
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:41,280
Speaker 0: And as a kid, once I figured it out, I was so nervous, and every millisecond that he was going down, I was afraid it was going to break.

574
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,710
Speaker 0: And I'd be like, da-nup, da-nup, da-nup, da-nup, da-nup.

575
00:37:44,132 --> 00:37:46,100
Speaker 0: Now here's where the sniping really came into play.

576
00:37:46,761 --> 00:37:50,280
Speaker 0: Let's say you take a guy, and you bring him down a little bit, and you get to the window.

577
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,989
Speaker 0: Oh shit, there's a terrorist in the window.

578
00:37:53,511 --> 00:37:55,760
Speaker 0: You can't break the window, the terrorist is right there.

579
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:56,560
Speaker 0: Yep.

580
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:56,801
Speaker 0: Shit.

581
00:37:57,203 --> 00:38:02,220
Speaker 0: Now you gotta go back out, go to the sniper, have the sniper take the terrorist out, if he's still there.

582
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,660
Speaker 0: The cool thing is, if you do that, your guy is hanging there above the window waiting.

583
00:38:07,361 --> 00:38:09,180
Speaker 0: You can't shoot your guy though, I tried.

584
00:38:11,183 --> 00:38:16,600
Speaker 1: Yep, so eventually you find a window you want to break into, so you push that A button again to swing away from the building.

585
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:23,620
Speaker 1: You swing in, you kick the window, the window shatters, even if it was already shattered by snipers before, and you're in the building.

586
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:30,800
Speaker 0: And now suddenly the music's rockin', you gotta kill all the terrorists, not kill the hostages, it's an FPS with the map on the side.

587
00:38:31,221 --> 00:38:32,880
Speaker 0: It's basically Shadow Gate, only quick.

588
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:41,798
Speaker 1: Yeah, all you do is you push forward to go forward, left to turn 90 degrees left, right to turn 90 degrees right, back to go back, one screen, and A to shoot.

589
00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:42,820
Speaker 1: And that's all you do.

590
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:50,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you gotta aim the gun too, so if you suddenly, you'll hear like "putt putt putt putt putt", and that means there's a terrorist in the room with you.

591
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:55,640
Speaker 0: And you turn around frantically, and you see a guy in green, and maybe he dodges to the right or dodges to the left, or maybe he starts shooting at you.

592
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:00,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, if there's a terrorist to the right of you, you don't see him, but you might hear him or know he's there.

593
00:39:00,621 --> 00:39:02,459
Speaker 0: And if you don't turn around and shoot him quick enough, you're dead.

594
00:39:02,721 --> 00:39:09,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you basically can only, it's not like an FPS with a smooth, you know, viewing, you can just kind of move and look around.

595
00:39:10,701 --> 00:39:16,520
Speaker 1: It's, you only have a view of, you know, straight ahead, and if he's to the right, he might as well be who knows where.

596
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,500
Speaker 0: And those terrorists are fucking dangerous, let me tell you, especially on the hard difficulty.

597
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:28,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, at least it lets you turn around very quickly, so you can, you know, you basically go into a, you take a step forward, you spin around in a circle, take a step forward, spin around in a circle.

598
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:38,880
Speaker 1: Now, on the easy mode of this game, there's a map, and the map has little dots on it that tell you where the terrorists are at all times, and where the hostages are at all times.

599
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:45,560
Speaker 1: And you can basically beat the game without even looking at the actual shooting screen and just looking at the map.

600
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:53,020
Speaker 0: Yep, but in the harder difficulties, one, it won't, the map will show terrorists, but it won't show all of the terrorists.

601
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,660
Speaker 1: Or it won't show the hostages, or it won't show any terrorists or hostages.

602
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:03,740
Speaker 0: And two, the harder the difficulty, the more tricky the terrorists are, and you gotta aim your gun more to actually get 'em.

603
00:40:05,064 --> 00:40:08,800
Speaker 1: Yep, and it just kinda, it gets harder and harder and harder, but it's really not that hard.

604
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:15,200
Speaker 0: Well, the worst thing is, you always have an itchy trigger finger, and I pretty much shot any hostage I saw.

605
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,703
Speaker 1: Yeah, shooting hostages sucks.

606
00:40:16,744 --> 00:40:22,580
Speaker 1: Basically, a hostage is a guy in a blue suit, as opposed to a guy in military camo, who doesn't, who has a gun.

607
00:40:23,501 --> 00:40:29,315
Speaker 1: And you'll often turn around, see a hostage and shoot, or shoot every time and kill all the hostages, and that's not good.

608
00:40:29,396 --> 00:40:30,017
Speaker 1: You can't do that.

609
00:40:30,057 --> 00:40:31,060
Speaker 1: That loses you points.

610
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:38,060
Speaker 1: So you just keep doing this until you kill all the terrorists and save as many hostages as you can, and then the game is over, you win.

611
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:48,060
Speaker 1: Depending on how well you do, how much time is left, how many hostages you save, how quickly you kill the terrorists, how many of your guys died, you get a better ending, and then you can try again.

612
00:40:48,521 --> 00:40:53,640
Speaker 0: Now, this is one of those games that, for when it came out, I think it was a pretty good game.

613
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,659
Speaker 1: It was frickin' awesome when it came out.

614
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:02,500
Speaker 0: Because in the very least, it's a game that tried to do something new, unique, and different with the NES, and it did it pretty well, all things considered.

615
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,880
Speaker 1: And I don't know any games that have really tried this since.

616
00:41:05,925 --> 00:41:06,959
Speaker 0: I really wish a game would.

617
00:41:08,161 --> 00:41:32,000
Speaker 1: I mean, even in FPSs these days, which could easily replicate this sort of thing, where everyone fulfills a different role in a multiplayer FPS, and one guy has to snipe that side of the building, and another guy has to snipe another side of the building, and some guy controls the spotlight in a machine gun on the building, and some other guy has to rappel down and then go into the building, and some other guys are the terrorists in the building, and that could be pretty cool.

618
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,600
Speaker 1: You could totally do that with Counter-Strike.

619
00:41:34,141 --> 00:41:45,520
Speaker 0: I always think, because I used to make Doom levels and stuff, and I messed with Doom, and pretty much once games got 3D, I didn't have the time to deal with making maps and frickin' Quake or Counter-Strike or any of that.

620
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,579
Speaker 1: It's just too hard and sucky to do that.

621
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,844
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it gives me an idea.

622
00:41:50,904 --> 00:42:00,255
Speaker 0: You could make a scenario in Counter-Strike that was very much like this game, where you position individual players on the counter-terrorists, like some of them were snipers.

623
00:42:00,295 --> 00:42:03,499
Speaker 0: They started in buildings with sniper rifles and terrorist hostages.

624
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:04,700
Speaker 0: You could do something pretty similar.

625
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,288
Speaker 1: That's the thing, though, is that FPSs tend to not have assigned roles.

626
00:42:09,348 --> 00:42:12,274
Speaker 1: They tend to go with, you can choose your role, like Team Fortress.

627
00:42:12,314 --> 00:42:13,636
Speaker 1: You choose which class you want to be.

628
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,538
Speaker 1: You want to be the medic, sure.

629
00:42:14,558 --> 00:42:15,460
Speaker 1: You want to be a scout, sure.

630
00:42:16,142 --> 00:42:23,380
Speaker 1: This would require the assignment of roles, which is something people don't like, or something FPSs don't seem to ever do, really.

631
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:23,760
Speaker 0: I don't know.

632
00:42:24,081 --> 00:42:34,293
Speaker 0: I mean, Natural Selection never really did it in the "the game does it" way, but it definitely did it in the "the players have to organize, and the commander has to assign roles on his

633
00:42:34,413 --> 00:42:34,533
Speaker 0: own.".

634
00:42:34,573 --> 00:42:36,075
Speaker 0: Like, you guys defend this.

635
00:42:36,295 --> 00:42:37,216
Speaker 0: You guys do this.

636
00:42:37,517 --> 00:42:38,498
Speaker 0: You're the healin' man.

637
00:42:38,518 --> 00:42:39,599
Speaker 0: You're the ninja.

638
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:40,340
Speaker 0: That sort of thing.

639
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,679
Speaker 1: Unless the other players on the other team don't do it, then no one has to.

640
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:44,645
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

641
00:42:44,705 --> 00:42:47,179
Speaker 0: I like stuff like that, and I wish more games did it.

642
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:47,720
Speaker 1: Yep.

643
00:42:48,382 --> 00:42:54,460
Speaker 1: So, for anyone who isn't cool and old school and doesn't remember Rescue the Embassy Mission for the NES, now you do.

644
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,642
Speaker 0: Play it at least once.

645
00:42:56,122 --> 00:43:00,110
Speaker 0: The first part of the game is really fun, and it's worth it to get good at that part of the game.

646
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:02,113
Speaker 0: Kind of like getting good at Bionic Commando.

647
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:05,700
Speaker 0: You'll feel good when you get jumbo to the end without dying.

648
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, Rescue the Embassy Mission is a game worth playing, definitely.

649
00:43:09,131 --> 00:43:11,740
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's a game worth beating on the hardest mode.

650
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,341
Speaker 0: No, fuck it.

651
00:43:12,541 --> 00:43:13,643
Speaker 0: It's not a great game.

652
00:43:14,023 --> 00:43:17,368
Speaker 0: It's a great game in terms of the potential, and in terms of when it came out.

653
00:43:17,729 --> 00:43:25,580
Speaker 0: It's not a great game nowadays, but I think someone could take what it was on, say, the Wii, and make it a fucking awesome game.

654
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,299
Speaker 1: It's definitely a significant game that everyone should know about and pay attention to.

655
00:43:30,301 --> 00:43:33,380
Speaker 0: Now, I think in the future we're gonna have to do a review of fucking Shadowgate.

656
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:34,902
Speaker 0: I don't know.

657
00:43:34,982 --> 00:43:39,720
Speaker 1: I haven't really gotten that far in Shadowgate without just reading his guide.

658
00:43:40,063 --> 00:43:42,260
Speaker 1: I beat Shadowgate maybe a quarter of the way through.

659
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:47,220
Speaker 0: I beat Shadowgate on my own as a kid through trial and error over the course of like nine months.

660
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,139
Speaker 1: I beat Deja Vu with trial and error.

661
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,666
Speaker 0: Ah, fucking Deja Vu.

662
00:43:50,927 --> 00:43:53,640
Speaker 0: That game was awesome, and by awesome I mean it was really hard.

663
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,960
Speaker 1: I've got Deja Vu 1 and 2 for the Game Boy Color.

664
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,320
Speaker 0: Ooh, I never played 2.

665
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:57,824
Speaker 1: I mean, either.

666
00:43:58,126 --> 00:43:59,215
Speaker 1: I have it for the Game Boy Color.

667
00:43:59,235 --> 00:43:59,820
Speaker 1: I never played it.

668
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:03,480
Speaker 0: Basically, Shadowgate was, no matter what you do, death.

669
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:06,979
Speaker 0: Deja Vu, same game.

670
00:44:07,363 --> 00:44:08,636
Speaker 1: Yep, yep, oh well.

671
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:10,500
Speaker 1: Yay, Kemco.

672
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:14,980
Speaker 0: I think my favorite death was when you get suddenly and randomly dissolved by acid.

673
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:23,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, some of those ones that were random were the funniest, but I also like the dragon barbecue one where you go into a room, it gets hotter.

674
00:44:23,501 --> 00:44:24,468
Speaker 1: You can take a treasure.

675
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:25,314
Speaker 1: It gets hotter.

676
00:44:25,355 --> 00:44:26,060
Speaker 1: You take a treasure.

677
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:31,820
Speaker 0: Well, no, what it was is you go into the room, right, and there's a bunch of treasures laying there, and a dragon on the other end.

678
00:44:32,282 --> 00:44:33,860
Speaker 0: One of the treasures is a shield.

679
00:44:34,264 --> 00:44:34,420
Speaker 0: Yep.

680
00:44:34,622 --> 00:44:36,699
Speaker 0: If you don't pick up the shield, the dragon just fucking kills you.

681
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:42,020
Speaker 0: If you pick up the shield, you block the fire, but the shield gets hotter and hotter and hotter.

682
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,840
Speaker 0: Eventually, if you stay in that room, the shield just melts, and then you die.

683
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,232
Speaker 1: But it allows you the chance to pick up a few of the other treasures.

684
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:50,140
Speaker 1: You have to know which ones you need and which ones you don't.

685
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:50,640
Speaker 0: Yep.

686
00:44:50,861 --> 00:44:51,602
Speaker 0: The best part was.

687
00:44:51,882 --> 00:45:09,760
Speaker 0: at one point you find a scantily clad woman chained up in a room, and all this game taught you about scantily clad women chained up in rooms is that the only thing you should ever do with a scantily clad woman chained up in a room is stab her through the heart with an arrow, because any other course of action leads to your death.

688
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:10,249
Speaker 1: Yep.

689
00:45:17,651 --> 00:45:19,799
Speaker 0: And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.
