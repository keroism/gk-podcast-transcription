1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,020
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, February 22nd, and this is Geek Nights.

2
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,220
Speaker 0: Tonight, I report on my experiences at Katsucon 12.

3
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,218
Speaker 1: Let's do this!

4
00:00:18,621 --> 00:00:21,980
Speaker 0: So you all probably noticed that yesterday's episode was a mite short.

5
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:23,858
Speaker 1: Because Rym deleted it.

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:24,881
Speaker 0: Yep.

7
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:32,960
Speaker 0: You see, I discovered something that I... I'm glad I discovered it now, as opposed to in the future, when perhaps we did a more important episode, or maybe we had an interview.

8
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,020
Speaker 0: But basically, in Audacity, you save things as a template.

9
00:00:37,462 --> 00:00:43,357
Speaker 0: So I had a template saved that has, you know, the opening music, the thing-of-the-day music, the closing music, the "Let's do

10
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:43,579
Speaker 0: this.".

11
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:46,739
Speaker 0: And then I put in the front half and the back half of the show.

12
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:47,605
Speaker 1: Don't give away our secret.

13
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,540
Speaker 1: They think we actually say "Let's do this" every day.

14
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,179
Speaker 0: Yeah, we've perfected the art of saying "Let's do this" in the exact same way.

15
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:55,340
Speaker 0: Yeah.

16
00:00:56,005 --> 00:00:56,559
Speaker 0: Without fail.

17
00:00:57,462 --> 00:00:57,624
Speaker 1: Yep.

18
00:00:58,878 --> 00:00:59,040
Speaker 1: Exactly.

19
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,859
Speaker 0: See, we used to actually say "Let's do this" every day.

20
00:01:02,321 --> 00:01:05,825
Speaker 0: And one day, we said it really well, and we listened to the recording, and we were like, "Wow.

21
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:07,600
Speaker 0: We'll never say it better than that.

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,732
Speaker 0: Let's just use that one

23
00:01:08,752 --> 00:01:09,056
Speaker 0: forever.".

24
00:01:09,935 --> 00:01:10,059
Speaker 1: Yep.

25
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:16,520
Speaker 0: And until we think of something else, we might change that someday, but we got good feedback on it early on, and we're sticking with it.

26
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,260
Speaker 1: Well, when we get the new hardware, we should probably re-record everything.

27
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:19,981
Speaker 0: Yeah.

28
00:01:20,423 --> 00:01:27,080
Speaker 0: Because, like I said yesterday, in the part of the podcast that got cut off, I finally ordered a dynamic range compressor.

29
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,638
Speaker 1: Compressor.

30
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:29,459
Speaker 0: Compressor.

31
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:31,262
Speaker 1: Yeah.

32
00:01:31,705 --> 00:01:34,220
Speaker 1: Joke about the associated German band.

33
00:01:34,662 --> 00:01:58,379
Speaker 0: Yeah, whenever we do the show on How to Do a Show, which, while Scott doesn't want to do one, because every podcast has done one, a lot of you have been asking for it, but we'll do a show on How We Do the Podcast, and I'll talk about what a compressor is, and why, I don't care how unprofessional or just "I'm doing a podcast for fun" you are, a compressor's like 70 bucks, and it'll make your podcast sound twice as good, as you'll see when I get one.

34
00:01:59,681 --> 00:02:07,700
Speaker 1: Actually, if you really, really, really want to hear a podcast about How to Do a Podcast, I think that there's one called Podcast 411.

35
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,739
Speaker 1: Or there's at least a website called Podcast 411 that has all this stuff.

36
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:15,460
Speaker 0: Someone else told me about them, because they're the ones who talked about Gizmo and how it's a good way to do podcast interviews.

37
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:23,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, Podcast 411 has a whole thing about compressors and how to use it and what to set the settings at, and they have all kinds of shit.

38
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,880
Speaker 0: But anyway, what happened to yesterday's episode?

39
00:02:26,263 --> 00:02:31,919
Speaker 0: We always record the show in two segments, front half, back half, just because that way we have time to collect our notes before we do our main bit.

40
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:40,940
Speaker 0: And I opened up, after I recorded everything and did the post-production on it, I opened up Audacity, and I opened the wrong template.

41
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:50,000
Speaker 0: The template happened to have a WAV file in it that had the same name as the WAV file that I had just recorded the back half of the show under.

42
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:58,737
Speaker 0: And Audacity somehow decided that when it opened, "Hey, I'm going to delete and overwrite that other file there and put my file there

43
00:02:58,777 --> 00:02:59,118
Speaker 0: instead.".

44
00:02:59,824 --> 00:03:00,338
Speaker 1: Good job.

45
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:07,839
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I deleted the hell out of that template, and I moved all the templates to another directory, and that'll probably be the last time that ever happens.

46
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:10,399
Speaker 1: Don't screw it up again.

47
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, we'll see.

48
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,540
Speaker 1: But you did most of the talking, and you hurt your throat doing it, and you had nothing to show for it.

49
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,707
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't feel too bad.

50
00:03:17,768 --> 00:03:24,020
Speaker 0: I wasn't too enabored with yesterday's episode, because I had drunk quite a bit of NyQuil right before it, and I kind of rambled a lot.

51
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,300
Speaker 1: It was an okay episode.

52
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:35,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I realized that I probably talked in more depth about the video game room than was probably necessary, so I can cover it in succinct, uh, succinctness.

53
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,599
Speaker 1: Well, let's say one sentence each for each thing we talked about.

54
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:40,780
Speaker 0: What, yesterday?

55
00:03:41,148 --> 00:03:41,298
Speaker 1: Yeah.

56
00:03:41,983 --> 00:03:42,217
Speaker 0: All right.

57
00:03:42,901 --> 00:03:45,200
Speaker 0: Old school video gaming was awesome at Katsucon.

58
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,698
Speaker 1: Punk kids don't get it.

59
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:50,159
Speaker 0: Yeah, punk kids totally don't get it.

60
00:03:50,546 --> 00:03:50,918
Speaker 1: One sentence.

61
00:03:51,427 --> 00:03:52,340
Speaker 0: All right, all right, all right, fine.

62
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:59,020
Speaker 0: So anyway, we've got a news bit, and because I'm pretty much going to talk for the entire second half of the show, here's Scott.

63
00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:08,335
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, so, if you don't know, there's this car called the Enzo Ferrari, aka the Ferrari F60.

64
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:16,319
Speaker 1: There are maybe, I don't know, uh, 399 of these in the whole entire world.

65
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:17,000
Speaker 0: You know what?

66
00:04:17,161 --> 00:04:21,298
Speaker 0: In the news post, I'll link to the top gear where they show an Enzo Ferrari and talk about it.

67
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a good one, yeah.

68
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:29,340
Speaker 0: So that way you guys will all, one, you'll learn about top gear, and two, you'll see what we're talking about and why we cried when we found out what happened to this car.

69
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,850
Speaker 1: All right, so there are 399 of these in the world now.

70
00:04:34,262 --> 00:04:34,658
Speaker 1: Well, okay.

71
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:38,679
Speaker 1: Um, they cost a million dollars each.

72
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,760
Speaker 1: They're made by hand by Ferrari in the Ferrari factory.

73
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:50,919
Speaker 1: Uh, they're really wicked fast and really wicked cool and, yeah, the top gear will teach you all about that.

74
00:04:52,206 --> 00:04:54,260
Speaker 1: But, um, you can't even get one.

75
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,439
Speaker 1: Like, if I, let's say I had two million dollars, right?

76
00:04:56,801 --> 00:04:58,140
Speaker 1: The car's one million dollars.

77
00:04:58,281 --> 00:04:59,579
Speaker 1: You'd think I could just buy one.

78
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,480
Speaker 1: Well, you'd be wrong if you thought that.

79
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:10,537
Speaker 1: The only way you can buy one is if Ferrari comes to you and says, "Hey, we'd like to offer you the opportunity to give us a million dollars and purchase this

80
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:10,799
Speaker 1: car.".

81
00:05:11,464 --> 00:05:17,060
Speaker 1: And, well, they're already all sold, so, uh, to famous people and rich people all around the world.

82
00:05:17,524 --> 00:05:24,940
Speaker 1: So, if you didn't get one already, and a rich guy doesn't give his to you, which is a fat chance, uh, good luck.

83
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,979
Speaker 0: So, I'm sure you all have heard of Gizmondo.

84
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:37,758
Speaker 1: Well, Gizmondo, if you don't know, is this guy and this company tried to release a new portable gaming system fairly recently, like, within the past year.

85
00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:41,499
Speaker 1: Um, and it failed, of course.

86
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:46,080
Speaker 1: But the concept behind this system was actually to have pretty good hardware.

87
00:05:46,686 --> 00:05:48,020
Speaker 1: And it had cool stuff.

88
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:54,660
Speaker 1: Like, it would have a GPS in it, uh, so that you could play cool GPS-based games, which was a good idea, I thought.

89
00:05:55,681 --> 00:05:59,539
Speaker 1: All sorts of Wi-Fi and wireless, and I think it had a little cell phone thingy in it.

90
00:06:00,121 --> 00:06:08,580
Speaker 1: You know, it was... It had the potential, if it had games, and the industrial design of it was a bit better.

91
00:06:09,082 --> 00:06:09,880
Speaker 0: But, no, it failed.

92
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,179
Speaker 0: The company practically going out of business, no money, horrible problems.

93
00:06:13,844 --> 00:06:27,238
Speaker 1: Right, the other problem with it was that, uh, the model, the sales model was, you can either buy one for a shit-ton of money, or get one for a reasonable cost, but then you'll keep seeing all kinds of advertisements while you play.

94
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:29,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

95
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:35,595
Speaker 1: And the thing wasn't really available anywhere, and no one knew or cared about it, they didn't really...

96
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,980
Speaker 0: So anyway, none of this has anything to do with the story.

97
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:48,359
Speaker 1: Well, it does have a little tiny bit to do with the story, is the guy in the story, Stefan Eriksson, 44 years old, was the executive of Gizmondo.

98
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:50,360
Speaker 0: And guess who had an Enzo Ferrari?

99
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,356
Speaker 1: Stefan Eriksson.

100
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,720
Speaker 0: So what did he do with this Enzo Ferrari?

101
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,479
Speaker 1: Well, he was driving it around, I think, California, it says?

102
00:06:58,202 --> 00:06:59,700
Speaker 0: I don't remember, I saw the article this morning.

103
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:03,060
Speaker 1: Actually, he wasn't driving it, his German friend, Deitrich.

104
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,055
Speaker 0: Whoa, whoa.

105
00:07:04,742 --> 00:07:12,118
Speaker 0: If I had an Enzo Ferrari, and I let you drive it, and you crashed it, and you didn't die, I would have killed you.

106
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,499
Speaker 1: Wait, okay, so here's the story.

107
00:07:17,141 --> 00:07:22,858
Speaker 1: Stefan Eriksson, the owner of the car, was too drunk, but he was the passenger, so that was okay.

108
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:32,358
Speaker 1: Deitrich, who we don't know, because basically he crashed the car into a pole, tearing the front half apart from the rear half.

109
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,159
Speaker 1: So he basically split the car in half, got out of the car, and ran away.

110
00:07:39,643 --> 00:07:40,677
Speaker 1: And they don't know where he is.

111
00:07:41,425 --> 00:07:41,759
Speaker 0: Great.

112
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,038
Speaker 1: Which is exactly what he should fucking do.

113
00:07:45,302 --> 00:07:52,380
Speaker 1: Because if he stayed, he would have been in more danger from the guy sitting next to him than from the car accident.

114
00:07:52,461 --> 00:07:56,179
Speaker 0: I guess the rest of the Enzo Ferraris are one step closer to the quickening now.

115
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:07,217
Speaker 1: Yep, but the moral of this story is that a million dollars worth of car does provide a million dollars worth of safety features, and they work.

116
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,080
Speaker 0: I mean, they were probably going in well excess of a hundred miles an hour.

117
00:08:12,722 --> 00:08:14,559
Speaker 1: It's really hard not to in this car.

118
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:18,541
Speaker 0: I mean-- Do you have enough trouble staying under 90 in your freaking Mazda 3?

119
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,870
Speaker 1: This thing has a top speed of like 225 miles an hour.

120
00:08:24,121 --> 00:08:27,080
Speaker 1: So, and it has the linear transmission.

121
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:37,480
Speaker 1: So unless you like stay in like a really low gear, or if you refrain from pushing the sport button or the race button, yes, you'll see when you watch it in top gear.

122
00:08:38,921 --> 00:08:40,759
Speaker 1: It's really hard to not go fast.

123
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,100
Speaker 1: So yeah.

124
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,116
Speaker 1: Goddamn.

125
00:08:45,502 --> 00:08:47,620
Speaker 1: This guy could have just given it to me and it would still be here.

126
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,447
Speaker 1: There would still be 399 Ferraris.

127
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:50,660
Speaker 1: But no-- You know what?

128
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:53,460
Speaker 0: I think you'd have more than one speeding ticket if you owned an Enzo Ferrari.

129
00:08:53,981 --> 00:08:59,620
Speaker 1: I don't care because I just make a big pile of them, and right before I had to pay them all, I would sell the Ferrari and pay them all off.

130
00:08:59,845 --> 00:09:00,419
Speaker 0: You know what I'd do?

131
00:09:00,881 --> 00:09:03,740
Speaker 1: Every time I got pulled over-- And by then I would pick up so many ladies, it wouldn't matter.

132
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,799
Speaker 0: There's a much simpler way around this.

133
00:09:06,341 --> 00:09:09,740
Speaker 0: Every time you get pulled over, offer to take the cop for a drive in it instead.

134
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:10,412
Speaker 1: Nah.

135
00:09:11,363 --> 00:09:12,559
Speaker 0: No cop would pass that down.

136
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,759
Speaker 1: That would work half the time.

137
00:09:14,561 --> 00:09:15,311
Speaker 0: That would work 100% of the time.

138
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,496
Speaker 0: I guarantee it.

139
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,060
Speaker 1: Well, you know what?

140
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,600
Speaker 1: There's a problem with that, is that if there's someone in the car with you, you pretty much have to leave them on the side of the road.

141
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,299
Speaker 1: It's a two-seater.

142
00:09:23,103 --> 00:09:23,192
Speaker 0: Yeah.

143
00:09:24,262 --> 00:09:25,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's bad.

144
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,900
Speaker 0: Things of the day.

145
00:09:32,965 --> 00:09:44,659
Speaker 1: The first thing I want to do is I'm not sure everyone realizes this, but the thing of the day is something we do every podcast where we say two cool things or one cool thing each that we saw on the internet or somewhere today.

146
00:09:45,223 --> 00:09:49,640
Speaker 0: Pretty much since the last episode, the coolest thing of note we have experienced in some way.

147
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:55,879
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if you go to our website, frontrowcrew.com, we have links to the things of the day.

148
00:09:56,181 --> 00:09:59,858
Speaker 1: So you should go there and look at the things of the day if you haven't already seen them.

149
00:10:00,862 --> 00:10:03,319
Speaker 1: So yeah, I don't think enough people are doing that.

150
00:10:04,261 --> 00:10:09,940
Speaker 1: Anyway, so my thing of the day, there seems to be a lot of news about Spider-Man lately.

151
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:13,960
Speaker 1: We had that old Spider-Man Japanese thing.

152
00:10:14,321 --> 00:10:14,978
Speaker 0: Yep, yep.

153
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,434
Speaker 1: There was a funny thing I saw today somewhere with a Spider-Man joystick.

154
00:10:19,474 --> 00:10:20,280
Speaker 1: that was pretty funny.

155
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:21,919
Speaker 0: Oh, Spider-Man plug and play.

156
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:27,919
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, but the funniest, well, I don't know how funny it is, but it was a comic book store.

157
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:33,099
Speaker 1: And a guy with a Spider-Man mask went into the comic book store.

158
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,799
Speaker 1: Who would... That's not strange at all.

159
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,039
Speaker 1: That's perfectly normal.

160
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:42,416
Speaker 0: In fact, they interview the guys, and both guys are like, or the guys are like, "Yeah, we saw this guy with a Spider-Man mask.

161
00:10:42,436 --> 00:10:42,658
Speaker 0: come in.

162
00:10:43,423 --> 00:10:43,891
Speaker 0: It's a comic

163
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:44,135
Speaker 0: shop.".

164
00:10:44,523 --> 00:10:45,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, what the hell.

165
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:57,740
Speaker 1: But the guy, if you've ever been to a comic shop, most of them keep the really expensive comics in glass cases with a little lock, you know, with a sliding glass back and forth, you know, so that you can't just walk over and touch them.

166
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,460
Speaker 1: You have to ask someone to come over and unlock the case, and they slide the glass, and they take it out, and, you know, whatever.

167
00:11:04,961 --> 00:11:13,680
Speaker 1: But this comic book store was one of the few that had, they had an X-Men number one, a Fantastic Four number one, and an Amazing Fantasy 15.

168
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:19,177
Speaker 1: If you don't know, Amazing Fantasy 15 is the first comic book ever that had Spider-Man in it.

169
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,958
Speaker 1: So before Amazing Fantasy 15 was sold in stores, Spider-Man did not exist.

170
00:11:25,362 --> 00:11:32,419
Speaker 1: And some kid with a Spider-Man mask walks into the store, takes a hammer, he smashes the case open, grabs the comics, and runs.

171
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,840
Speaker 1: It was like a zillion, thousands and thousands of dollars for the comics.

172
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,459
Speaker 1: He just ran away.

173
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,359
Speaker 0: Just watch it.

174
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,080
Speaker 0: There's an actual video of the Spider-Man guy stealing it.

175
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:46,200
Speaker 1: There's a whole video of the new, the local news reporting on it, and the security tape and everything.

176
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,638
Speaker 1: So just watch it.

177
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, he totally got away with it.

178
00:11:49,564 --> 00:11:50,420
Speaker 1: It's super irony.

179
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:56,219
Speaker 0: I mean, it's so-- Spider-Man's trying to hide his origin, so he's stealing the, you know, number ones.

180
00:11:56,692 --> 00:11:56,960
Speaker 0: Yeah.

181
00:11:58,604 --> 00:11:59,480
Speaker 1: It's kind of weird, though.

182
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:07,500
Speaker 1: It's like, those comic book guys were so fat and schlubby, Spider-Man didn't even have to use his super spider strength or his webbing or anything to get away.

183
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,758
Speaker 0: Yeah, he just had to use the dreaded fence and jump over it.

184
00:12:11,061 --> 00:12:13,100
Speaker 1: And the dreaded hammer to break the glass.

185
00:12:15,065 --> 00:12:17,198
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day, I'm not really going to talk about it right now.

186
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:19,979
Speaker 0: I just used it mostly because I want a link to it.

187
00:12:20,461 --> 00:12:23,000
Speaker 0: But it's a movie that I saw at Katsu-Con.

188
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,700
Speaker 0: And I've got quite a bit to say about this movie.

189
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,219
Speaker 0: So the link is there.

190
00:12:28,561 --> 00:12:30,100
Speaker 0: It's probably the best link I could find.

191
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,320
Speaker 0: I mean, this is a movie that has received zero votes on IMDb.

192
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,357
Speaker 0: No one's seen it.

193
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,540
Speaker 1: Well, at least it exists on IMDb.

194
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,119
Speaker 1: Sometimes the movies aren't even there, if they're really rare.

195
00:12:43,944 --> 00:12:48,820
Speaker 0: So, you'll have to pardon my voice if I sound a little odd, but I'm still quite sick from Katsu-Con.

196
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:49,854
Speaker 1: Illan.

197
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm illan, like a villain.

198
00:12:52,626 --> 00:12:53,059
Speaker 1: That's bad.

199
00:12:53,443 --> 00:12:54,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was terrible.

200
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,318
Speaker 0: So I'm all Novacane, well not Novacane, but I'm all Nyquilled up.

201
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,117
Speaker 0: I've got my Ricolas in my mouth and my Gobstoppers and my water and my tea and we'll see how we do.

202
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:08,682
Speaker 0: But, as you all know, I spent last weekend at Katsu-Con 12.

203
00:13:08,682 --> 00:13:10,340
Speaker 0: And thus is my con report.

204
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,319
Speaker 0: Now, Katsu-Con 12, Katsu-Con in general, is in Washington, D.C.

205
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,500
Speaker 0: Which, I haven't been there outside of anime cons.

206
00:13:19,522 --> 00:13:21,480
Speaker 0: It's not the best place to have a convention.

207
00:13:22,243 --> 00:13:25,957
Speaker 1: The thing is, is that they have really good buildings there to put conventions in.

208
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,940
Speaker 1: But the surrounding area really makes it painful to have the convention.

209
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,177
Speaker 0: I mean, let me put it this way.

210
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,308
Speaker 0: Katsu-Con 12, right?

211
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,469
Speaker 0: Parking at the hotel, $28 a day.

212
00:13:39,729 --> 00:13:39,793
Speaker 0: Wow.

213
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:46,420
Speaker 0: The nearest parking garage that had any cheaper price, it was like $15 a day, and it was a good 10 minute walk away from the con.

214
00:13:47,362 --> 00:13:56,320
Speaker 1: The only time I've seen it that bad is when I went to the All-Star Game of Baseball at Fenway Park in Boston.

215
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,120
Speaker 1: The one parking lot was $25.

216
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,933
Speaker 1: The parking lot right across from the stadium was $35 for the game.

217
00:14:04,664 --> 00:14:05,819
Speaker 1: That's the worst I've ever seen.

218
00:14:06,744 --> 00:14:15,060
Speaker 1: So, $28 a day, that's pretty bad considering it's a hotel in a city as opposed to an All-Star Game of Baseball.

219
00:14:15,381 --> 00:14:30,799
Speaker 0: Now, I gotta say, I'm real happy with Katsu-Con because Thursday before I left for the con, I was looking at the website to get directions, and I noticed that under driving directions, they had multiple paragraphs with big, bold, red letters telling me not to drive to the con.

220
00:14:31,482 --> 00:14:36,120
Speaker 0: They told me that there's no parking, that if I find parking, it'll be expensive, and that they're not kidding.

221
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,579
Speaker 0: They recommend that I park at a metro station, come in, or take a train or something.

222
00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:41,660
Speaker 0: And they weren't kidding.

223
00:14:42,642 --> 00:14:46,053
Speaker 0: I drove to, I think it was Greenbelt Station, which is right off I-95.

224
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,000
Speaker 0: It has its own exit off of the freeway to this station.

225
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,639
Speaker 0: Parked for free.

226
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,338
Speaker 1: That's pretty cool.

227
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:57,019
Speaker 0: I spent four bucks taking the train to the con and then on Sunday back from the con.

228
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,300
Speaker 1: How close was the train to the con?

229
00:14:59,142 --> 00:15:01,100
Speaker 0: It was about 25 minutes, I'd say.

230
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,420
Speaker 1: No, I meant walking from the destination train station.

231
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,180
Speaker 0: Oh, the station was right next to the convention.

232
00:15:08,627 --> 00:15:08,880
Speaker 1: Awesome.

233
00:15:09,282 --> 00:15:10,479
Speaker 0: Like a two-minute walk.

234
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,237
Speaker 1: Sweet.

235
00:15:12,003 --> 00:15:12,760
Speaker 0: It was fantastic.

236
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,290
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, my friend Scott Johnson parked at the hotel and was out about 120 bucks.

237
00:15:18,607 --> 00:15:19,039
Speaker 0: I warned him.

238
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,920
Speaker 0: I told him he couldn't even find his way to the hotel.

239
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:21,680
Speaker 0: It was fantastic.

240
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,579
Speaker 1: Guess what he deserves.

241
00:15:24,082 --> 00:15:24,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't mean to rag on him.

242
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,760
Speaker 0: We actually had a good time.

243
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,100
Speaker 0: I went to the con with, it was myself and Scott Johnson.

244
00:15:28,882 --> 00:15:31,120
Speaker 0: You may know him as the legendary Scott Johnson.

245
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:38,079
Speaker 0: Him and I go around speaking at anime cons, like on club summits and other panels, and we were actually featured in New Type once.

246
00:15:38,821 --> 00:15:40,700
Speaker 1: In a very, very tiny, tiny square.

247
00:15:41,162 --> 00:15:46,920
Speaker 0: No, no, it was a full-page article, but the funny thing was, the picture shows, both pictures are like me speaking.

248
00:15:47,522 --> 00:15:49,140
Speaker 0: I'm in the center and I got my big hands thick.

249
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,217
Speaker 1: They're pretty bad pictures, though.

250
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,539
Speaker 0: But the article doesn't mention me.

251
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:55,239
Speaker 0: The article mentions the legendary Scott Johnson, and it uses the word legendary.

252
00:15:55,943 --> 00:15:56,419
Speaker 1: Yeah, it does.

253
00:15:57,105 --> 00:15:57,518
Speaker 1: I've seen it.

254
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we didn't actually go to this con to speak.

255
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,860
Speaker 0: We just went to actually enjoy the con.

256
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,940
Speaker 0: And we went with a bunch of his friends from back home in Pennsylvania, which I know them.

257
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,457
Speaker 0: They're cool people.

258
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:14,480
Speaker 0: And we went with a friend of ours, a con friend, Lara, who has been, we met her a long time ago at, I think, Anime Central.

259
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,920
Speaker 0: And we just go to all these cons together all the time.

260
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:21,100
Speaker 0: I seem to have a lot of con friends, people I only really know at conventions.

261
00:16:21,841 --> 00:16:22,839
Speaker 0: But I see them every year.

262
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,160
Speaker 1: That's cool.

263
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:33,017
Speaker 1: It's like, I know, when I was a kid, they used to be like school friends, friends on the block, you know, who lived near you, but you didn't go to school with them.

264
00:16:33,721 --> 00:16:35,800
Speaker 1: And then, like, kids, camp kids.

265
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,920
Speaker 1: Like, you knew them from summer camp.

266
00:16:37,482 --> 00:16:40,939
Speaker 1: You'd have all these different groups of friends, and they would, you know, be from different places.

267
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,540
Speaker 0: I really like the, I like con friends.

268
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,177
Speaker 0: It really shows how, I guess, close-knit this geek community is.

269
00:16:47,303 --> 00:16:52,260
Speaker 0: But anyway, I got, I'm going pretty much chronological order here, just because they're, I could organize anyway, whatever.

270
00:16:53,042 --> 00:16:54,620
Speaker 0: So, I show up, and I find the hotel.

271
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,078
Speaker 0: And it's the Omni Shoreham in downtown D.C.

272
00:16:58,402 --> 00:17:00,640
Speaker 0: It was rather posh and fancy-looking.

273
00:17:01,802 --> 00:17:02,980
Speaker 1: All hotels are fancy-looking.

274
00:17:03,365 --> 00:17:04,198
Speaker 1: They have a lot of that.

275
00:17:04,622 --> 00:17:05,279
Speaker 0: Let me put it this way.

276
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:10,720
Speaker 0: It was posh and fancy in the sense that there were breakables within touching distance everywhere.

277
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:12,940
Speaker 1: Oh, all hotels have stuff like that.

278
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,598
Speaker 0: Huge chandeliers, like, right above my head.

279
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:25,339
Speaker 0: Big, giant, just displays of, like, old pottery and vases and dishes and wine bottles and, like, little tiny tables that look like if I just leaned against them, they'd break.

280
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:27,398
Speaker 1: All hotels have stuff like that.

281
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,413
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, and even, like, the crummiest Holiday Inn.

282
00:17:31,433 --> 00:17:34,020
Speaker 1: in the lobby, they have, like, some stuff.

283
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:34,324
Speaker 0: No, no, no, no.

284
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,280
Speaker 0: This hotel, compared to, say, every other convention hotel I've ever been to--

285
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,267
Speaker 1: Well, they just have more stuff,

286
00:17:39,114 --> 00:17:51,140
Speaker 0: as opposed to-- Well, no, like, I've been to a lot of hotel conventions, like Anime Central and OhioCon, and they were nice, you know, typical hotel stuff, but they didn't have the sheer level of breakableness within reach of con-goers.

287
00:17:52,662 --> 00:17:52,999
Speaker 1: Eh, whatever.

288
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,820
Speaker 0: I mean, basically, this hotel had never hosted an AnimeCon before, and I actually interviewed a bunch of the staff later.

289
00:17:59,221 --> 00:18:01,399
Speaker 0: They really had no idea what they were getting into with this.

290
00:18:02,484 --> 00:18:15,780
Speaker 0: I mean, Thursday night, there are hundreds of people milling around in costumes, talking to each other, sitting on every surface in sight, wandering into the bar, getting drunk, running around, yelling, and I see these staff people just staring at them, like, "What the hell?

291
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:16,848
Speaker 0: You have rooms.

292
00:18:17,172 --> 00:18:17,919
Speaker 0: Why are you down here?

293
00:18:18,484 --> 00:18:18,933
Speaker 0: What's going

294
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:19,138
Speaker 0: on?".

295
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,420
Speaker 0: It was--yeah.

296
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:35,379
Speaker 0: I wish I had the interviews to actually play for you, but I interviewed a bunch of people with this tape recorder that my friend Scott had there, and when I got home, I learned that of the four playback heads that we have in our house, not a single one of them is functional anymore.

297
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,099
Speaker 1: We can't play tapes.

298
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:39,559
Speaker 1: I consider that to be a good thing.

299
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,299
Speaker 0: The first tape recorder ate the tape and exploded it.

300
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,899
Speaker 0: I had to pull it out of the cartridge and re-spool it into a different one.

301
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:50,139
Speaker 0: The second tape recorder was full of battery acid, and then when we finally plugged it into the wall, it also had a short.

302
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,080
Speaker 1: We should get, I don't know, something.

303
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,620
Speaker 0: Well, luckily, I remember the interviews.

304
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,559
Speaker 0: Now, I have a few things to say about the hotel.

305
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,080
Speaker 1: He's gonna put words in people's mouths.

306
00:19:00,908 --> 00:19:01,460
Speaker 0: Eh, not really.

307
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:06,440
Speaker 0: The interviews were actually very to the point, and with one exception, everyone was very cool.

308
00:19:07,662 --> 00:19:08,359
Speaker 1: Someone wasn't cool?

309
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:09,939
Speaker 0: Yeah, one guy wasn't cool.

310
00:19:10,363 --> 00:19:10,937
Speaker 1: Oh, I hear that.

311
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,400
Speaker 0: But basically, the hotel was set up really well for a convention.

312
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,146
Speaker 0: It was perfect.

313
00:19:16,611 --> 00:19:17,419
Speaker 0: There was enough space.

314
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,339
Speaker 0: There weren't choke points in the hallways where you couldn't get through.

315
00:19:21,121 --> 00:19:21,879
Speaker 1: Yeah, look at the map.

316
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,851
Speaker 1: It actually looked like it had nice, good--.

317
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,059
Speaker 1: the rooms were all the right size, and Katsu-kan used the rooms well.

318
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,180
Speaker 0: And the artist's alley setup was fantastic.

319
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,019
Speaker 0: I'll get to that later.

320
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:35,840
Speaker 0: I mean, 'cause last year, Katsu-kan was in a fairly crappy hotel, and it was just-- it was a mess.

321
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,599
Speaker 0: This year was great.

322
00:19:37,641 --> 00:19:43,160
Speaker 0: Now, the only problem I saw, not with Katsu-kan, just with the hotel, was that basically, there are elevators.

323
00:19:43,242 --> 00:19:45,218
Speaker 0: the only way to get to rooms, 'cause the hotel is frickin' huge.

324
00:19:45,842 --> 00:19:46,260
Speaker 1: No stairs?

325
00:19:46,942 --> 00:19:51,439
Speaker 0: There were stairs right there, which was fantastic, but most people's rooms are, you know, on the seventh, eighth floor.

326
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:56,200
Speaker 0: The elevators, there were two for each wing of the hotel, total.

327
00:19:57,582 --> 00:19:58,700
Speaker 0: And they were tiny.

328
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:06,057
Speaker 0: Like, actually, Saturday, I saw this fat dude stand in front of the elevator, and basically, if he got into the elevator, no one could ride with him.

329
00:20:07,104 --> 00:20:07,359
Speaker 0: Wow.

330
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:12,739
Speaker 0: And there was a line to get into the elevator, and kids kept pushing past him and getting in, and he couldn't get into the elevator.

331
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,212
Speaker 1: He should've taken the stairs.

332
00:20:14,233 --> 00:20:14,920
Speaker 1: That's what he deserves.

333
00:20:15,123 --> 00:20:16,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, he wouldn't take the stairs.

334
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,129
Speaker 1: Well, guess what?

335
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,000
Speaker 1: How to lose some weight.

336
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:19,880
Speaker 1: Maybe he can stand there until he loses weight.

337
00:20:20,621 --> 00:20:22,139
Speaker 1: I think he's better off taking the stairs.

338
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:32,339
Speaker 0: The elevators didn't fail, like they have in many other cons, just because, you know anime cons, people are wandering around constantly, and elevators just, like, at Otakon, they turn off the escalators, they don't break.

339
00:20:33,121 --> 00:20:33,417
Speaker 1: Good idea.

340
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:40,180
Speaker 0: But the elevators didn't break, but there was such a line that it was basically impossible for people to go to their rooms during the day.

341
00:20:41,121 --> 00:20:41,568
Speaker 1: That's fine.

342
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:43,640
Speaker 1: I would go to my room when everyone else is doing something important.

343
00:20:43,861 --> 00:20:44,620
Speaker 0: Oh, you know what was great?

344
00:20:45,281 --> 00:20:49,339
Speaker 0: Our room was next to the stairs and the elevators on the first floor.

345
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:53,090
Speaker 0: I had to go up one flight, so I never felt bad.

346
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,600
Speaker 0: I'd carry my DS around, and then, hey, I don't want my DS anymore.

347
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,320
Speaker 0: I'd just pop back to the room, drop it off, come back down.

348
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:57,920
Speaker 0: It took about a minute.

349
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:03,680
Speaker 1: Dude, if we ever go to a con that's in a hotel, we have to get rooms on the lowest floor possible.

350
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,400
Speaker 0: Yes, from now on, I'm going to request rooms, like, next to an elevator on the first floor.

351
00:21:08,302 --> 00:21:09,740
Speaker 1: Next to the stairs on the first floor.

352
00:21:09,881 --> 00:21:15,199
Speaker 0: I got to say, having a room that close to the con made my constant con experience at least twice as good.

353
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,979
Speaker 1: Yeah, imagine if you were on the eighth floor, how much time you would have lost going all the way up there waiting in elevator lines.

354
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,379
Speaker 0: I wouldn't have been carrying my DS around all the time like I did.

355
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,652
Speaker 1: Yeah.

356
00:21:23,693 --> 00:21:24,039
Speaker 1: All right.

357
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:26,720
Speaker 1: Keep that in mind, everybody.

358
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:35,079
Speaker 1: If you're going to a con that's in one hotel, self-contained, get rooms at low elevation, no matter how cool you think it might be to be up high.

359
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,820
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess there are two types of anime cons now, at least of the bigger cons.

360
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,039
Speaker 0: There's the convention center con, and there's the hotel con.

361
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,260
Speaker 0: And Katsucon, Anime Central, those are hotel cons.

362
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:51,060
Speaker 0: And the only real difference is that a hotel con goes 24/7.

363
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:56,880
Speaker 0: I mean, at Katsucon, the video game room and the anime rooms, 4 AM, you can just wander in and play Halo or DDR, Guitar Heroes.

364
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:58,436
Speaker 0: Awesome.

365
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,419
Speaker 0: Instead of having room parties, people just all got together somewhere at the con and did stuff.

366
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:03,584
Speaker 0: Mmm.

367
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,179
Speaker 0: You know, unlike Otakon, where everything goes until 2 AM and then they pull the fire alarm and kick us out.

368
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,218
Speaker 1: Yeah, fire alarm.

369
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,480
Speaker 0: And I like both types of cons equally.

370
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,180
Speaker 0: I think that both have a lot to offer.

371
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,579
Speaker 1: Yeah, they have their place.

372
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,000
Speaker 1: But you're not a real man until you've experienced an Otakon fire alarm.

373
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:25,089
Speaker 0: Yeah, when you're in the con at, you know, 2.25 and they pull the fire alarm and there's policemen yelling, "Get the hell out!

374
00:22:25,412 --> 00:22:26,240
Speaker 0: Go away!

375
00:22:26,703 --> 00:22:27,780
Speaker 0: The con is closed!

376
00:22:28,161 --> 00:22:28,567
Speaker 0: What are you

377
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:29,053
Speaker 0: doing?!".

378
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:30,619
Speaker 1: That's the best.

379
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,800
Speaker 1: And then one guy tries to hide in the convention center and gets arrested for not evacuating.

380
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, you wouldn't believe how many people try to just hide at Otakon.

381
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:38,856
Speaker 1: It's great.

382
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,980
Speaker 0: But anyway, also Thursday night, there's a bar on the first floor.

383
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:43,890
Speaker 0: And it was a pretty classy bar.

384
00:22:43,991 --> 00:22:44,740
Speaker 0: Bartenders were cool.

385
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:49,099
Speaker 0: They seemed to be jivin' with this whole, "Wow, there's a bunch of freaks in our bar

386
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:49,240
Speaker 0: thing.".

387
00:22:50,464 --> 00:22:54,518
Speaker 0: And actually, I ended up hung out with a good friend, Tex, we knew from various cons and from our old college.

388
00:22:55,202 --> 00:22:57,280
Speaker 0: And he introduced us to, God, I forgot his name.

389
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,220
Speaker 0: It's on the tip of my tongue.

390
00:22:58,563 --> 00:22:59,740
Speaker 0: But he's the head of NekoCon.

391
00:23:00,782 --> 00:23:02,380
Speaker 0: And he was in the bar and we hung out with him for a while.

392
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,220
Speaker 0: He was a really cool guy.

393
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,760
Speaker 0: So I just wanted to give him a little shoutout because he was really awesome.

394
00:23:06,441 --> 00:23:12,400
Speaker 0: And I'm going to try to go to NekoCon since I've actually haven't been to it recently and I'd like to.

395
00:23:12,801 --> 00:23:14,500
Speaker 0: It's in Virginia Beach and it looks like an awesome con.

396
00:23:14,981 --> 00:23:15,830
Speaker 1: I don't know, it's called NekoCon.

397
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,558
Speaker 0: It's not a furry con.

398
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,019
Speaker 0: It's not AnthroCon, I'll give you that.

399
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,479
Speaker 1: But it puts me off still.

400
00:23:22,141 --> 00:23:25,759
Speaker 1: Does he really think about, I don't know, maybe think about the name or something?

401
00:23:26,244 --> 00:23:26,515
Speaker 1: I don't know.

402
00:23:27,303 --> 00:23:28,520
Speaker 0: Hey, what about, you know, Yuricon?

403
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:29,818
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't go to that.

404
00:23:31,145 --> 00:23:31,716
Speaker 1: I'm never going to.

405
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,820
Speaker 0: So Friday morning, I didn't pre-register or anything.

406
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,389
Speaker 0: KatsuCon for me is usually the day before someone says, "Hey, you want to go to

407
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:38,939
Speaker 0: KatsuCon?"

408
00:23:39,082 --> 00:23:39,758
Speaker 0: And I drive down.

409
00:23:40,801 --> 00:23:42,300
Speaker 0: So I get in the registration line.

410
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,658
Speaker 0: Well, I go to find the registration line, I can't find it.

411
00:23:45,461 --> 00:23:52,618
Speaker 0: So finally I find the registration area and I see this huge line next to the pre-reg sign and I can't find the registration line.

412
00:23:53,502 --> 00:23:56,119
Speaker 0: So I look around and eventually I see some guy with a staff shirt.

413
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,216
Speaker 0: I'm like, "Where's the registration

414
00:23:57,256 --> 00:23:57,460
Speaker 0: line?"

415
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,153
Speaker 0: And he says, "You're

416
00:23:59,254 --> 00:23:59,335
Speaker 0: it.".

417
00:24:00,404 --> 00:24:01,879
Speaker 0: And he walks me over and I get my badge.

418
00:24:03,486 --> 00:24:03,760
Speaker 1: Awesome.

419
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:08,601
Speaker 0: Yep, the regular reg line actually got horrible, but not until about 11.

420
00:24:08,601 --> 00:24:09,981
Speaker 0: And I did this at 9.

421
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:13,760
Speaker 0: So I forgot that if you're not at Otocon, no one really gets to the con early.

422
00:24:15,402 --> 00:24:18,299
Speaker 0: But I guess the moral is, don't pre-register for KatsuCon.

423
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,589
Speaker 1: Well, here's the thing, is?

424
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:23,739
Speaker 1: I think a lot of people are pre-registering now, not because they don't think they'll get a registration.

425
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,820
Speaker 1: You can get a registration to any of these cons.

426
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,897
Speaker 0: Well, you get the discount, too.

427
00:24:27,201 --> 00:24:29,379
Speaker 1: It's the discount, and a lot of these people are poor.

428
00:24:29,921 --> 00:24:35,697
Speaker 1: I think if you have a lot of money, unless you're going to a con that has a sellout possibility like Otocon...

429
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,380
Speaker 0: Or if you're getting there Thursday and they have a Thursday badge pickup.

430
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,540
Speaker 1: Ah, Thursday badge pickup is important.

431
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,260
Speaker 0: Thursday badge pickup is often key.

432
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:48,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, unless they have some other reason besides price to pre-register, like maybe a giveaway or something.

433
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:53,000
Speaker 1: I know the New York Comic-Con gave away action figures to the first thousand pre-registers.

434
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,780
Speaker 0: Yup, Serenity action figures.

435
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,940
Speaker 1: Yup, and not the Christian comic, either.

436
00:24:57,765 --> 00:25:01,160
Speaker 0: Or the Serenity channel that was on the TVs at KatsuCon.

437
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:08,309
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway, unless there's another reason besides money, and you have enough money, just register at the con.

438
00:25:08,349 --> 00:25:09,720
Speaker 1: It's not any different, you know?

439
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,185
Speaker 0: And you know what?

440
00:25:10,206 --> 00:25:11,200
Speaker 0: The line is usually less.

441
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,560
Speaker 1: Plus, pre-registering means you have, like, this commitment.

442
00:25:15,122 --> 00:25:20,251
Speaker 1: If you don't pre-register, and you decide, "Oh, I only want to go one day," or maybe, "You know what?

443
00:25:20,271 --> 00:25:21,120
Speaker 1: I'm going to leave on Sunday.

444
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:21,968
Speaker 1: Things suck.

445
00:25:22,069 --> 00:25:23,040
Speaker 1: You can do that," sort of thing.

446
00:25:23,281 --> 00:25:28,160
Speaker 0: Though I will say, from a guy running a con perspective, you want people to pre-register.

447
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:29,327
Speaker 0: Oh, absolutely.

448
00:25:30,032 --> 00:25:31,020
Speaker 1: You know how many people are coming.

449
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:41,059
Speaker 0: I mean, if you really want to support a con, like, you love a con, and it's your favorite con, pre-register, because it really helps them out in terms of getting their funding together and budgeting and all that stuff.

450
00:25:41,924 --> 00:25:43,838
Speaker 0: The more people pre-register, the better the con's going to be.

451
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:58,099
Speaker 1: Yeah, if everyone for the con pre-registers, and the con knows exactly how many people are coming and they know exactly what they need to do, if no one pre-registers, they don't even have the con because they can't guarantee enough people will register at the door to, you know, make it work.

452
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:21,583
Speaker 0: Now, KasuCon is following the trend that many cons have been doing of not having events before, you know, like, 2 o'clock or so on Friday, which is a great thing, because while I get there every con, you know, Thursday night, Thursday morning for Otacon, most people don't really roll in until 10 or 11, and then they have to stand in line, and no one's really ready to actually do anything at the con until around 1.

453
00:26:21,583 --> 00:26:34,380
Speaker 0: So, I mean, like, the video game room and the Artist Alley and everything opened right away at, like, 10 AM, 9 AM, but there were no events until about 2, which was fantastic, because everyone was not even, like, a little panel here, panel there.

454
00:26:34,541 --> 00:26:39,918
Speaker 0: No, they didn't screw any panelists by saying, "Hey, you have to panel you have to do your panel before anyone even has their

455
00:26:39,938 --> 00:26:40,140
Speaker 0: badge.".

456
00:26:41,995 --> 00:27:09,048
Speaker 1: See, the thing is, it's like, it seems that at anime cons and things, that the, all the people who have things to set up, the dealers, the artists, everyone, it seems like they get there the same time as the, you know, the participants of the convention, all the members, and so, the members get there, and while they're waiting in line, you know, the other people are setting up, and there's, like, this area of time early Friday.

457
00:27:09,068 --> 00:27:18,120
Speaker 1: that's sort of, like, lost, like, it's not lost, because you can still do fun stuff if you're awesome, but it's like, what if you're the first guy in the pre-reg line just because of, you know, chance, let's say.

458
00:27:18,181 --> 00:27:18,726
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

459
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:25,008
Speaker 0: It wasn't lost at all at Katsucon, because starting at noon, they started doing all the showings in the anime rooms.

460
00:27:25,755 --> 00:27:28,220
Speaker 0: The video game room opened up right a fuckin' way.

461
00:27:29,421 --> 00:27:32,825
Speaker 0: So I went down, that was the first thing I did, was go into the video game room and play some old school games.

462
00:27:33,007 --> 00:27:43,278
Speaker 1: Yeah, see, that's fun, but compare it to something like, you know, the big comic cons, or something like that, where, like, the newer comic con is gonna be this Friday, right?

463
00:27:44,081 --> 00:27:45,171
Speaker 1: Or, like, E3.

464
00:27:45,433 --> 00:28:00,540
Speaker 1: If you show up at E3 right away, the Nintendo people are already, before anyone gets there, before the first person gets their badge, every single person who has a display, or a table, or whatever, is already there and waiting.

465
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,866
Speaker 0: I point out that there's no displays or anything like that.

466
00:28:02,987 --> 00:28:08,259
Speaker 0: All the events that don't happen until later are events that people have to actively go to when they're a one-time thing.

467
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,724
Speaker 0: By putting them early on Friday, they're wasted.

468
00:28:11,533 --> 00:28:17,556
Speaker 1: But think about this, when you get to Otacon, right, the artist and artist alley get there at the same time as people who are going to the artist alley.

469
00:28:17,576 --> 00:28:26,380
Speaker 1: If it could do one tiny bit better would be, before anyone even gets in line for a badge, all the artists are in artist alley with a table set up.

470
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,522
Speaker 0: You realize that's silly and impossible for a lot of reasons.

471
00:28:28,603 --> 00:28:30,040
Speaker 1: I know, but it's a problem.

472
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:30,786
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

473
00:28:30,988 --> 00:28:32,300
Speaker 0: I mean, no, it's not at all.

474
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:33,872
Speaker 1: Other cons do it.

475
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:35,793
Speaker 1: They have everyone already set up before anyone gets in.

476
00:28:35,813 --> 00:28:37,693
Speaker 0: That's because those are cons where those are exhibitors.

477
00:28:37,773 --> 00:28:39,408
Speaker 0: I mean, the dealers were already set up ready to go.

478
00:28:39,449 --> 00:28:40,800
Speaker 1: That's the word I was looking for, exhibitor.

479
00:28:41,122 --> 00:28:43,248
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's almost no exhibitors at an anime con.

480
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:43,632
Speaker 1: Yeah.

481
00:28:43,996 --> 00:28:51,269
Speaker 0: So I'm glad that they had just this kind of open time where everyone was just kind of hanging out, getting ready, and then starting at one o'clock, they had the first panel.

482
00:28:52,278 --> 00:28:54,642
Speaker 0: And I didn't actually do anything until opening ceremonies at three.

483
00:28:54,662 --> 00:28:56,400
Speaker 0: Opening ceremonies at three.

484
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,329
Speaker 0: I almost always avoid opening ceremonies at anime cons.

485
00:28:59,652 --> 00:29:02,320
Speaker 0: No offense to anime cons, but they're almost always terrible.

486
00:29:02,502 --> 00:29:03,047
Speaker 1: And boring.

487
00:29:03,936 --> 00:29:10,097
Speaker 1: I've been to two different opening ceremonies at two different... Maybe I've been to three or four opening ceremonies.

488
00:29:10,117 --> 00:29:10,907
Speaker 1: I don't even remember them.

489
00:29:10,947 --> 00:29:11,900
Speaker 1: Some of them are so bad.

490
00:29:13,044 --> 00:29:19,619
Speaker 1: There was Oda-Kan, which is just corny, and there was Penguin-Kan, which was the guy proposed to his wife.

491
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,592
Speaker 0: Now, Anime Central always had great opening ceremonies.

492
00:29:23,713 --> 00:29:24,743
Speaker 0: They're an exception to the rule.

493
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:31,246
Speaker 0: And Kazu-Kan, the opening ceremonies weren't great, but they were definitely worth going to.

494
00:29:31,267 --> 00:29:34,140
Speaker 0: It was a very informative opening ceremony.

495
00:29:35,141 --> 00:29:36,378
Speaker 0: They went through all the con rules...

496
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,014
Speaker 1: Stop pausing to cheer your rickolas.

497
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:39,265
Speaker 0: I'm sick, what do you want?

498
00:29:39,932 --> 00:29:46,983
Speaker 0: So they went through all their con rules, they did funny stuff, they announced all the changes to the schedule and everything, and it was generally entertaining and worth seeing.

499
00:29:47,003 --> 00:29:52,099
Speaker 0: Then, right after that, the AMV contest, which I actually sat through.

500
00:29:52,763 --> 00:29:53,247
Speaker 1: The whole thing?

501
00:29:53,268 --> 00:29:56,540
Speaker 0: I walked out about fifteen minutes early just to go to a panel.

502
00:29:56,901 --> 00:29:57,203
Speaker 0: Alright.

503
00:29:57,727 --> 00:30:05,760
Speaker 0: But... Unlike the previous years and many cons, I mean, there's been definitely a drought of good anime music videos.

504
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:10,570
Speaker 0: And it really didn't break until the previous Oda-Kan, when there were actually some good videos.

505
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:16,429
Speaker 0: And I've seen this trend of good videos continuing, so I think AMVs are back on the rise.

506
00:30:16,449 --> 00:30:21,824
Speaker 1: I think it's because the only people still doing AMVs and still caring about them are the people who are really into it.

507
00:30:22,106 --> 00:30:27,600
Speaker 1: You don't have this glut of kids who are like, "AMVs are the new cool thing, I'm gonna make Naruto plus Linkin Park,

508
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:28,565
Speaker 1: weeee!".

509
00:30:28,585 --> 00:30:30,820
Speaker 0: Oh, you do, but a lot of the big cons don't show them anymore.

510
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,590
Speaker 1: Well, the big cons never really showed them in the first place.

511
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:37,059
Speaker 0: I submitted to you Oda-Kan two years ago.

512
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,753
Speaker 1: They didn't actually show those.

513
00:30:38,855 --> 00:30:40,047
Speaker 0: They showed many of them.

514
00:30:40,067 --> 00:30:41,560
Speaker 1: They showed them in the crap room.

515
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,035
Speaker 0: No, they showed crap, crap, crap Naruto videos in the main one, too.

516
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:45,580
Speaker 0: Really?

517
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,204
Speaker 1: Yeah.

518
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:46,609
Speaker 1: Wow.

519
00:30:47,196 --> 00:30:55,094
Speaker 0: But the AMVs were good, and I gotta say, I don't know what's up, but Utena seems to be making this huge resurgence lately.

520
00:30:55,437 --> 00:31:00,203
Speaker 0: Maybe There were at least four AMVs to Utena in the AMV show.

521
00:31:00,384 --> 00:31:01,858
Speaker 0: There was also a panel on Utena.

522
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,467
Speaker 1: Maybe it was the recent box set release, I don't know.

523
00:31:04,568 --> 00:31:09,073
Speaker 0: Also, there was a pile of art, both in the artist alley and in the art show of Utena.

524
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:11,159
Speaker 0: I even bought something really cool that I'll talk about in a bit.

525
00:31:12,703 --> 00:31:22,040
Speaker 0: The other thing I noticed is that last year, all the AMVs I watched, they mostly seemed to come from the first four or so episodes of shows that had come out recently.

526
00:31:23,022 --> 00:31:27,899
Speaker 0: Now, this year, almost every AMV came from the last four episodes and spoiled everything.

527
00:31:29,925 --> 00:31:40,399
Speaker 0: Though I gotta say, the two notable videos that I saw of the whole show were one, there was one to Last Exile, and it was Killer Queen to Maestro Delphine.

528
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,479
Speaker 1: That fits.

529
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,880
Speaker 0: If you've seen Last Exile, that's actually pretty hilarious.

530
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,170
Speaker 1: Nice little character...

531
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:46,586
Speaker 0: Yup.

532
00:31:46,749 --> 00:31:47,380
Speaker 0: And it was well done.

533
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,667
Speaker 1: Mosaic, I guess.

534
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:56,860
Speaker 0: And someone did this video to Utena, the show, though it had tiny clips from the movie called Embers, and it's freaking amazing.

535
00:31:58,163 --> 00:32:00,219
Speaker 0: I'd say it's up there with Hit Me Baby one more time.

536
00:32:01,742 --> 00:32:02,650
Speaker 0: I'll download it and we'll watch.

537
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,629
Speaker 0: It's really well done.

538
00:32:04,993 --> 00:32:06,749
Speaker 0: It doesn't beat Hit Me Baby one more time.

539
00:32:07,132 --> 00:32:07,817
Speaker 0: It's up there.

540
00:32:10,281 --> 00:32:13,280
Speaker 0: So, after that, the art auction was awesome.

541
00:32:14,061 --> 00:32:18,083
Speaker 0: It was the quality of Otacon, but much smaller because there was less people.

542
00:32:18,447 --> 00:32:19,640
Speaker 0: I saw a lot of really good art.

543
00:32:19,882 --> 00:32:23,739
Speaker 0: I bid on a hell of a lot of art, and I got outbid on most of it.

544
00:32:26,365 --> 00:32:29,620
Speaker 0: In fact, there was this cool little print someone made of a kitsune.

545
00:32:29,982 --> 00:32:33,743
Speaker 0: Original art is really cool, and I bid $15.

546
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:37,859
Speaker 0: I come back the next day, someone bids $16 on top of me.

547
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,412
Speaker 1: That's all eBay action.

548
00:32:39,472 --> 00:32:40,119
Speaker 1: That's how it works.

549
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:45,100
Speaker 0: But the thing is, if something gets four bids, it goes to the auction, and then you're screwed, because it's going to go for a million.

550
00:32:47,308 --> 00:32:53,558
Speaker 0: And I didn't feel bad because not ten minutes later, I come back and someone else had sniped that kid and bid $17, so I gave up on it.

551
00:32:55,046 --> 00:32:58,408
Speaker 0: But someone made this really cool tissue print utenna piece.

552
00:32:58,731 --> 00:33:00,310
Speaker 0: I'll scan it in at some point so you can all see it.

553
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:00,859
Speaker 0: It's really cool.

554
00:33:02,445 --> 00:33:04,487
Speaker 0: The minimum bid was like $9, and I wanted it.

555
00:33:05,032 --> 00:33:06,871
Speaker 0: I saw it, and I decided I'm leaving with that.

556
00:33:06,891 --> 00:33:11,156
Speaker 0: I bid $25, and no one even considered outbidding me, and I got it.

557
00:33:12,564 --> 00:33:20,520
Speaker 0: I usually lose the bidding at cons because I bid Friday, and then I forget that I bid on things, and then Sunday I go to pick my art up, and I've been outbid on everything.

558
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:29,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, if I wanted to really win some... If I saw an art in the art auction that I had to have, I would just come back on Sunday at the last minute and go through.

559
00:33:29,904 --> 00:33:32,171
Speaker 1: I wouldn't even bother Friday or Saturday in and out.

560
00:33:32,232 --> 00:33:32,779
Speaker 1: It's not worth it.

561
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,514
Speaker 1: That's how you win on eBay, is?

562
00:33:34,534 --> 00:33:36,716
Speaker 1: you have these little sniping programs that bid at the last second.

563
00:33:36,736 --> 00:33:38,519
Speaker 1: You have to bid at the last second, or else you're not going to win.

564
00:33:39,423 --> 00:33:40,635
Speaker 0: The Artist Alley was really good.

565
00:33:40,696 --> 00:33:43,400
Speaker 0: It was definitely a step up from last KatsuKans Artist Alley.

566
00:33:43,945 --> 00:33:47,119
Speaker 0: Though, last KatsuKans was screwed by the fact that it was in a different hotel.

567
00:33:49,091 --> 00:33:50,005
Speaker 0: But there were a lot of good artists.

568
00:33:50,046 --> 00:33:51,139
Speaker 0: It was really roomy and open.

569
00:33:52,601 --> 00:33:54,551
Speaker 0: The only thing was, I didn't really buy anything from it.

570
00:33:54,895 --> 00:34:07,580
Speaker 0: Because while it was really good, there were a lot of... There were a decent number of people who were basically selling the kind of things that Otakon just banned from their Artist Alley.

571
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:08,788
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

572
00:34:08,971 --> 00:34:13,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, things that are obviously just, "Wow, that's a print I can buy somewhere else that I just

573
00:34:13,521 --> 00:34:13,824
Speaker 0: made.".

574
00:34:13,945 --> 00:34:18,775
Speaker 0: Or, "Wow, that's a Mario flag made with felt that can be bought from somewhere

575
00:34:18,917 --> 00:34:19,078
Speaker 0: else.".

576
00:34:19,523 --> 00:34:20,108
Speaker 0: Things like that.

577
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,260
Speaker 0: Basically bootleg goods.

578
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:32,757
Speaker 1: Yeah, see I think there's something too that the bigger cons where you get bigger artists coming in, so that people who aren't so much artists are afraid to go in on it.

579
00:34:33,302 --> 00:34:39,159
Speaker 1: Or it's so big that the real artists rush in and try to get tables right away.

580
00:34:39,725 --> 00:34:42,360
Speaker 1: And those bootleg people don't really try so hard.

581
00:34:43,525 --> 00:34:50,349
Speaker 0: Though what made me really happy was that there were a lot of webcomic artists and comic artists and that sort of thing at the con.

582
00:34:50,793 --> 00:34:51,460
Speaker 0: In the Artist Alley.

583
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,319
Speaker 0: Dominic Deegan was there.

584
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,940
Speaker 0: I've read his comic off and on.

585
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,378
Speaker 0: VGCats, the guy was there.

586
00:34:57,684 --> 00:34:59,060
Speaker 1: VGCats seems to be going to every con.

587
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,371
Speaker 0: He goes to every frickin' con.

588
00:35:00,653 --> 00:35:02,277
Speaker 0: I was gonna interview him but my tape ran out.

589
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,980
Speaker 0: Which is fine because I wouldn't be able to play it anyway.

590
00:35:06,384 --> 00:35:12,799
Speaker 0: Now, the video Game Room, I talked about it yesterday in the Lost episode, but basically they split it into two sections.

591
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,719
Speaker 0: Old school and new school.

592
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,665
Speaker 0: And the new school was typical Halo whatever.

593
00:35:17,685 --> 00:35:22,657
Speaker 0: I actually played Halo 2 for the first time and I stand by my opinion that it's not a good game.

594
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,826
Speaker 0: Though I will admit, in the honesty, in the fairness of openness, whatever, Scott Johnson kicked my ass.

595
00:35:30,472 --> 00:35:31,623
Speaker 0: He kicked all of our asses.

596
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:32,511
Speaker 0: He won handily.

597
00:35:32,612 --> 00:35:36,090
Speaker 1: Well that's cause he has all those used GameCube games he bought for like ten bucks.

598
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:38,554
Speaker 0: Yeah, like X13 or whatever that Game Boy's would do with the company.

599
00:35:38,574 --> 00:35:41,886
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are all these console controller based FPS's.

600
00:35:41,947 --> 00:35:43,825
Speaker 1: So, playing against you Mr.

601
00:35:43,886 --> 00:35:45,886
Speaker 1: Mouse and Keyboard, he basically kicked your ass.

602
00:35:46,836 --> 00:35:52,473
Speaker 0: Now, the old school room, basically they had all these original old school arcade game cabinets.

603
00:35:52,937 --> 00:35:54,128
Speaker 0: And it was freaking awesome.

604
00:35:54,512 --> 00:35:58,349
Speaker 0: They had like Pole Position 2, Marvel Madness, Gorf, Xevious.

605
00:35:58,369 --> 00:36:02,168
Speaker 1: It doesn't seem like they had super old stuff, but they had semi old stuff.

606
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,944
Speaker 0: It was old classic stuff.

607
00:36:04,004 --> 00:36:06,898
Speaker 1: It was like late 80's kind of action, you know.

608
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,358
Speaker 1: It was mid 80's actually, not late 80's.

609
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're talking Tekken 2 type stuff.

610
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,980
Speaker 0: Though that was actually one of the newer games there.

611
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,233
Speaker 1: Tekken 2 is like 90's-ish.

612
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,479
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was one of the newest games there.

613
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,080
Speaker 0: You know, they had the original Spy Hunter.

614
00:36:19,423 --> 00:36:20,271
Speaker 0: It was awesome.

615
00:36:20,674 --> 00:36:22,310
Speaker 0: Though I interviewed a bunch of punk kids.

616
00:36:22,734 --> 00:36:25,380
Speaker 0: And these kids were born, you know, they were like 14.

617
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,960
Speaker 0: They'd never seen these games before.

618
00:36:27,461 --> 00:36:29,480
Speaker 0: One kid thought these were main cabinets.

619
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,838
Speaker 0: He didn't realize that these games actually were arcade games back in the day.

620
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:33,981
Speaker 1: Wow.

621
00:36:34,001 --> 00:36:37,539
Speaker 0: Because he'd seen these games on like the GameCube, Midway Arcade Classic whatevers.

622
00:36:38,203 --> 00:36:39,277
Speaker 0: And he didn't realize that.

623
00:36:39,338 --> 00:36:40,428
Speaker 0: no, those are arcade machines.

624
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,559
Speaker 1: You know what we should do one day?

625
00:36:42,142 --> 00:36:45,380
Speaker 1: We should get together and have like an internet field trip.

626
00:36:46,503 --> 00:36:50,853
Speaker 1: And get a bunch of punk kids and they pay X amount of dollars and we'll rent a coach bus.

627
00:36:51,337 --> 00:36:52,753
Speaker 1: And we'll take them all to Fun Spot.

628
00:36:52,833 --> 00:36:54,479
Speaker 1: And we'll show them what games are supposed to be.

629
00:36:57,049 --> 00:37:02,027
Speaker 0: But I gotta say, everyone, even the kids who were too young to know what these games were, seemed to love them.

630
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:08,086
Speaker 0: And I discovered that being drunk, you are much better at Robotron than when you are sober.

631
00:37:08,551 --> 00:37:10,799
Speaker 0: I think it's because you're not as afraid of the robots.

632
00:37:11,783 --> 00:37:13,198
Speaker 1: It all depends on the kind of games.

633
00:37:13,258 --> 00:37:15,240
Speaker 1: Some games, if you're drunk, you'll just die.

634
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,459
Speaker 0: If you're drunk in Spy Hunter, you just crash into a tree.

635
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,590
Speaker 1: It all depends on how much precision you need.

636
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,974
Speaker 1: Like in Robotron, it's not really about precision.

637
00:37:23,015 --> 00:37:24,753
Speaker 1: It's about dodging the robots.

638
00:37:25,279 --> 00:37:31,080
Speaker 1: But in a game like, I don't know, Asteroids, which you can barely or Lunar Lander.

639
00:37:32,566 --> 00:37:33,440
Speaker 1: You can't play those drunk.

640
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,039
Speaker 1: You'll just die.

641
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:37,923
Speaker 0: Now the dealer's room was actually very good.

642
00:37:38,186 --> 00:37:38,852
Speaker 0: Though it was weird.

643
00:37:38,953 --> 00:37:40,347
Speaker 0: It was set in the exhibit hall.

644
00:37:40,953 --> 00:37:44,819
Speaker 0: And I went to the exhibit hall and it smelled kind of funny and the ceiling was weird.

645
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:47,620
Speaker 0: And I was wondering, you know, what's up with this room?

646
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,650
Speaker 0: It's kind of at a slant.

647
00:37:48,974 --> 00:37:50,307
Speaker 0: Like the whole room was at a slant.

648
00:37:51,418 --> 00:37:54,387
Speaker 0: And then I get to the end of the room and I see parking spaces.

649
00:37:54,751 --> 00:37:59,400
Speaker 0: And I discovered that they've turned the lowest section of the parking garage into an exhibit hall.

650
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,419
Speaker 0: And that's the dealer's room.

651
00:38:01,823 --> 00:38:03,056
Speaker 0: It actually worked out really well.

652
00:38:03,096 --> 00:38:04,379
Speaker 0: That way the dealers had a lot of space.

653
00:38:05,864 --> 00:38:07,195
Speaker 0: No, it didn't smell bad.

654
00:38:07,256 --> 00:38:08,205
Speaker 0: It just smelled weird.

655
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:09,540
Speaker 0: Like, wow.

656
00:38:10,561 --> 00:38:12,019
Speaker 0: It didn't smell like the inside of a hotel.

657
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,911
Speaker 0: Now there were a lot of good dealers there.

658
00:38:15,073 --> 00:38:15,900
Speaker 0: I'd say it was comparable.

659
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,860
Speaker 0: At least in terms of the merchandise.

660
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,960
Speaker 1: Maybe that's why there was no parking.

661
00:38:19,861 --> 00:38:20,569
Speaker 0: No, that wasn't it.

662
00:38:21,236 --> 00:38:22,999
Speaker 0: This has been an exhibit hall for a long time.

663
00:38:23,222 --> 00:38:23,625
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.

664
00:38:24,755 --> 00:38:28,939
Speaker 1: Oh, as in they physically with construction, converted...

665
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:29,990
Speaker 0: No, not with construction.

666
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:32,535
Speaker 0: Like, they put a drop ceiling in, but they didn't do much to it.

667
00:38:32,636 --> 00:38:37,200
Speaker 1: No, but I mean like, it used to be the parking lot and they physically turned it into an exhibit hall.

668
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:37,973
Speaker 0: Yeah, they did stuff to it.

669
00:38:38,034 --> 00:38:43,968
Speaker 1: Not like it's usually the parking lot, but today dealers are putting their things out in the parking spaces.

670
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:48,050
Speaker 0: No, I think they can convert it between the two, but I think it takes a while.

671
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,769
Speaker 1: Oh, it's like when it was like, okay, okay.

672
00:38:49,971 --> 00:38:50,153
Speaker 0: Yeah.

673
00:38:50,518 --> 00:38:54,740
Speaker 0: But I mean, I'd say it was comparable to Otacon in terms of the array of merchandise.

674
00:38:55,021 --> 00:38:56,540
Speaker 0: I didn't see anything was lacking.

675
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:02,560
Speaker 0: However, I also didn't see anything I really wanted because I guess I'm kind of jaded.

676
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,098
Speaker 0: I mean, oh, cute little things that I can buy anywhere now.

677
00:39:07,265 --> 00:39:15,999
Speaker 1: The stuff that I'm really looking for now is like, mostly the stuff that's newer, I can't get it in the US, and you're giving a good price.

678
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:20,619
Speaker 1: Mostly Nintendo, like keychains and dioramas and all those sorts of things.

679
00:39:21,343 --> 00:39:21,637
Speaker 1: The dots.

680
00:39:22,741 --> 00:39:24,280
Speaker 1: That's the stuff that I really want in dealers rooms now.

681
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,459
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got a little Mario diorama, I was pleased with that.

682
00:39:26,942 --> 00:39:28,033
Speaker 0: But it was a good dealers room.

683
00:39:28,134 --> 00:39:30,039
Speaker 0: I mean, Katsucon is a good dealers room, what can I say.

684
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:34,580
Speaker 0: They didn't have the super DVD deals, you find it like Otacon, but what do you expect?

685
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,540
Speaker 0: I mean, Katsucon's fairly early in the con season.

686
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,122
Speaker 1: Yep.

687
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:39,587
Speaker 0: Now, the panels.

688
00:39:40,254 --> 00:39:47,808
Speaker 0: I usually go to a couple panels at every con, and this is really the only bad point, the only bad thing I can say about this Katsucon 12.

689
00:39:47,808 --> 00:39:57,748
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm one where if I go to a con, and things aren't going well, I will harp on and report on and yell about every crap thing that happened at the con.

690
00:39:58,071 --> 00:39:59,020
Speaker 0: I'll rip a con apart.

691
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:08,130
Speaker 1: Usually when I report on absolutely anything at all, I just say everything that's negative and everything I didn't say or comment on is assumed to be amazingly positive.

692
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:10,978
Speaker 1: So, you know, that's how it is.

693
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:14,413
Speaker 0: I guess I want to say right now that Katsucon was fantastic.

694
00:40:14,676 --> 00:40:19,808
Speaker 0: Katsucon 12 will go down on my list of cons I've been to as one of the best cons I've ever been to.

695
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:20,476
Speaker 0: I loved it.

696
00:40:22,549 --> 00:40:41,100
Speaker 0: But, I went to two panels at Katsucon, and I don't think they really screen who their panelists are, because I mean, Otacon, I see, like every panel I've spoken on or gone into, there's always a staffer or someone standing in the room, like, watching the panel, and then they do all these polls and they always ask people, like, what panels were good?

697
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,072
Speaker 0: Which panels were bad?

698
00:40:42,133 --> 00:40:42,599
Speaker 0: What do you think?

699
00:40:43,326 --> 00:40:46,480
Speaker 0: And I've noticed that panels that were crap never come back to Otacon.

700
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:54,100
Speaker 0: And we'll see what happens at Katsucon next year, but basically I went to the Club Summit panel and I went to the Utena panel.

701
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,820
Speaker 0: See, there's all this Utena stuff.

702
00:40:56,841 --> 00:40:59,246
Speaker 0: Now, the Club Summit panel was just ass.

703
00:40:59,912 --> 00:41:05,386
Speaker 0: I mean, I hate to sound like, you know, a jerk, but the people didn't really seem to know what they were talking about.

704
00:41:06,113 --> 00:41:09,448
Speaker 0: They sat down in front of the room and just started talking to people in the front row for a while.

705
00:41:10,014 --> 00:41:17,619
Speaker 0: Then they talked about club stuff for like a minute or two and they just kind of trailed off and started chatting with people in the front of the room about anime.

706
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:30,780
Speaker 1: Well, you know what I think it could be, now that I think about it a little bit, is if you look at the schedule, does it look like people were competing, like there was some guy who wanted to get a panel but some other guy already had the panel spot?

707
00:41:31,704 --> 00:41:32,600
Speaker 0: No, it didn't look like that.

708
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,260
Speaker 0: I mean, I think it looks like both the panels that I went to were run by staffers.

709
00:41:36,821 --> 00:41:38,236
Speaker 0: They were just normal panels at the con.

710
00:41:38,277 --> 00:41:38,882
Speaker 0: Like, there was nothing.

711
00:41:38,903 --> 00:41:44,679
Speaker 1: See, so at a small con, usually, you know, they need more panels to fill it in.

712
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:45,366
Speaker 1: It's not like...

713
00:41:45,447 --> 00:41:47,569
Speaker 0: See, no, that is definitely not the case at Kazuka.

714
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:54,159
Speaker 0: They had one panel room and it was just panels all day and from the other people I've talked to, almost every panel was great.

715
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,207
Speaker 0: Or at least, you know, as good as you'd expect.

716
00:41:57,855 --> 00:42:04,318
Speaker 1: But I mean, do they have so many people outside of staffers wanting to do panels that they, you know...

717
00:42:04,581 --> 00:42:08,459
Speaker 0: Well, I'm fairly certain that there are people who wanted panels that did not get them.

718
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,931
Speaker 1: Yeah?

719
00:42:09,951 --> 00:42:13,388
Speaker 1: Because usually when staffers do panels, that's because no non-staffer...

720
00:42:13,408 --> 00:42:16,400
Speaker 0: Well, also because they tend to be the knowledgeable type people who can run a panel.

721
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,205
Speaker 1: Sometimes.

722
00:42:17,226 --> 00:42:20,160
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess I just expect some level of professionalism.

723
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,670
Speaker 0: I mean, even a tiny bit.

724
00:42:21,751 --> 00:42:24,859
Speaker 0: Just, if you're gonna run a panel, talk about what you said you'll talk about.

725
00:42:25,461 --> 00:42:25,643
Speaker 1: Mhm.

726
00:42:26,454 --> 00:42:26,960
Speaker 0: Or something.

727
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:31,227
Speaker 0: But these guys just sat at the front of the room and gave kind of bad advice first off.

728
00:42:31,288 --> 00:42:33,168
Speaker 0: I mean, they really don't seem to know how to run a club too well.

729
00:42:33,613 --> 00:42:37,877
Speaker 0: And then they just rambled about anime and talked amongst themselves until the panel ended.

730
00:42:39,445 --> 00:42:39,606
Speaker 0: Mhm.

731
00:42:39,627 --> 00:42:41,344
Speaker 0: Now, I wondered... Alright.

732
00:42:41,385 --> 00:42:42,380
Speaker 0: I mean, I even walked out on it.

733
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,780
Speaker 0: It was not worth my time.

734
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,644
Speaker 1: No, because those people probably weren't, you know, they just go and they say, "Okay, we're doing a

735
00:42:48,685 --> 00:42:49,009
Speaker 1: panel.".

736
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:49,800
Speaker 1: They sit at the top.

737
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,140
Speaker 1: You know, they just, they don't have a plan.

738
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,140
Speaker 1: They're not thinking about doing an awesome panel.

739
00:42:54,301 --> 00:42:55,210
Speaker 0: I mean, maybe I'm overcritical.

740
00:42:55,231 --> 00:42:56,059
Speaker 1: They just start talking and go.

741
00:42:56,761 --> 00:42:58,785
Speaker 0: I mean, I thought after I walked out, like, "Wow.

742
00:42:59,351 --> 00:42:59,856
Speaker 0: Maybe I'm being

743
00:42:59,917 --> 00:43:00,220
Speaker 0: overcritical.".

744
00:43:00,841 --> 00:43:07,170
Speaker 0: Because, I mean, I do a lot of panels at cons and I've done it a lot and I guess I really expect people to put a lot of preparation into it, you know.

745
00:43:07,756 --> 00:43:08,967
Speaker 0: Have your talking points.

746
00:43:09,451 --> 00:43:10,925
Speaker 0: Have the questions ready.

747
00:43:11,208 --> 00:43:14,359
Speaker 0: Have your panel, like, have all the people around the panel coordinate and ready to go.

748
00:43:14,881 --> 00:43:18,545
Speaker 0: Have contingencies in case no one has questions or in case the crowd sucks or whatever.

749
00:43:18,585 --> 00:43:19,659
Speaker 0: Just be ready to do something.

750
00:43:20,981 --> 00:43:25,980
Speaker 0: So I decided, you know, in the interest of fairness, I'd go to one other panel and that way I'd have kind of a baseline.

751
00:43:26,541 --> 00:43:27,898
Speaker 0: So I went to the Utena panel the next day.

752
00:43:29,084 --> 00:43:29,880
Speaker 0: And it was awesome.

753
00:43:30,344 --> 00:43:31,132
Speaker 0: It was informative.

754
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:32,566
Speaker 0: The guy really knew what he was talking about.

755
00:43:32,586 --> 00:43:34,384
Speaker 0: It was interesting.

756
00:43:34,404 --> 00:43:37,880
Speaker 0: I mean, he didn't say anything new to me, but I'm a freaking Utena nut.

757
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:39,013
Speaker 1: Yeah.

758
00:43:39,054 --> 00:43:39,179
Speaker 0: So.

759
00:43:39,881 --> 00:43:41,012
Speaker 0: But he was a really cool guy.

760
00:43:41,033 --> 00:43:42,466
Speaker 0: I would have interviewed if I had time.

761
00:43:42,608 --> 00:43:47,660
Speaker 0: And actually, at that panel I got interviewed by some guy from Anime World Order.

762
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:48,809
Speaker 0: This anime podcast.

763
00:43:49,415 --> 00:43:53,260
Speaker 0: And little shout out here, because I wanted to interview him, but I didn't have a recorder bit with me at the time.

764
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:59,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, I started listening to their podcast and, you know, it's not a 100% perfect podcast, you know.

765
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:00,828
Speaker 0: What podcast is?

766
00:44:01,091 --> 00:44:03,400
Speaker 0: I know that we, you know, erased yesterday's podcast.

767
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:04,468
Speaker 1: Of course, of course.

768
00:44:04,912 --> 00:44:10,829
Speaker 1: But the one thing I can say about them that is the best is that they know a lot of shit about anime that I don't know.

769
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:13,460
Speaker 1: Like, they had nicknames for directors.

770
00:44:13,861 --> 00:44:17,696
Speaker 1: Because they're like, "That director always kills every one of the people in the

771
00:44:17,797 --> 00:44:18,079
Speaker 1: anime.".

772
00:44:18,362 --> 00:44:21,736
Speaker 1: They called them, like, "Kill 'em all, Tomi whatever his name

773
00:44:21,796 --> 00:44:21,958
Speaker 1: was.".

774
00:44:22,403 --> 00:44:22,646
Speaker 0: Yeah.

775
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,525
Speaker 1: They know a lot of stuff.

776
00:44:24,545 --> 00:44:35,639
Speaker 1: So if you want to, like, really like, know who directed this, and he was also the director of that, and you know, this character designer made this thing in this year.

777
00:44:36,081 --> 00:44:38,907
Speaker 1: These guys know that stuff in their head, and it's really interesting.

778
00:44:38,927 --> 00:44:40,282
Speaker 0: I mean, Geek Dice covers a lot of stuff.

779
00:44:40,363 --> 00:44:41,859
Speaker 0: I mean, we're definitely Renaissance geeks.

780
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:51,192
Speaker 0: We cast our net very broadly and widely, and we go fairly deep, but these guys just have a missile going straight down into that pool of anime.

781
00:44:51,697 --> 00:44:51,980
Speaker 1: Yeah.

782
00:44:52,401 --> 00:45:05,130
Speaker 0: I mean, when he interviewed me, and then we talked a bit about, because, you know, I actually like, it's funny that I've, I mean, I ran all these clubs, and I'm so, like, into this con anime club, anime thing, and yet, I don't know a lot of this.

783
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:07,171
Speaker 0: Like, I don't know much about the directors of most anime.

784
00:45:07,373 --> 00:45:07,636
Speaker 0: Yeah.

785
00:45:07,656 --> 00:45:11,291
Speaker 0: He asked me, he's doing an informal poll of, "Name any directors other than

786
00:45:11,311 --> 00:45:11,857
Speaker 0: Miyazaki."

787
00:45:12,924 --> 00:45:13,938
Speaker 0: And I can only name two.

788
00:45:14,442 --> 00:45:20,848
Speaker 0: I can name Anno, you know, from Evangelion, and I knew who Ikuhara was, but his name, it slipped my tongue for some reason.

789
00:45:20,868 --> 00:45:24,179
Speaker 0: I didn't, I couldn't come up with his name, but I knew who he was, the creepy guy.

790
00:45:26,201 --> 00:45:30,849
Speaker 0: But they were cool guys, they interviewed me, maybe I'll appear on their podcast whenever they do their Katsu Con con report.

791
00:45:30,869 --> 00:45:31,879
Speaker 1: That'd be cool.

792
00:45:32,861 --> 00:45:36,646
Speaker 0: But, I mean, the Utena panel was awesome, and the Club Summit panel sucked.

793
00:45:37,557 --> 00:45:48,179
Speaker 0: So, I guess, I don't, I guess seeing the Utena panel as good as it was made me at least not feel bad about panning the other panel, because it wasn't just me being, you know, an overcritical jerk.

794
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:49,903
Speaker 0: Mmm.

795
00:45:51,164 --> 00:45:57,639
Speaker 0: Now, the last bit, and I saved this for the end, because it's something we don't really do at cons anymore, but anime showings.

796
00:45:58,861 --> 00:46:01,619
Speaker 1: Okay, so, we don't watch anime at cons.

797
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:02,866
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean,

798
00:46:03,309 --> 00:46:19,206
Speaker 1: if I watch something at a con, it's because it's not available on the internet easily, it's not available on DVD, it's being shown at the con on a big screen, and it's something that is either really, really awesome, or has big, big potential for awesome,

799
00:46:19,952 --> 00:46:20,516
Speaker 0: and I have

800
00:46:20,557 --> 00:46:20,920
Speaker 1: to see it.

801
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:27,734
Speaker 0: I mean, it used to be, at cons a long time ago, basically just before we started going to cons, that, I mean, digisubs weren't readily available.

802
00:46:28,017 --> 00:46:31,500
Speaker 1: No one, you know, very few people outside of college had fast internet connections.

803
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:38,620
Speaker 1: Digisubs took a while to make, everything like Gatekeepers was one of the first, so think around that time, when Gatekeepers came out in Japan.

804
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:43,979
Speaker 0: Yep, so basically, people would go to cons, and there'd be anime they'd never seen before, so they'd watch it.

805
00:46:44,381 --> 00:46:59,859
Speaker 1: And there was really no other way for them to watch it, they couldn't easily get it, buying it in the store, they couldn't, you know, it used to be an activity at cons, where everyone would bring a VCR and blank tapes, and some guy would bring an anime, and everyone would make a copy, and that would be the activity at the con,

806
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:00,603
Speaker 0: you know?

807
00:47:00,643 --> 00:47:00,825
Speaker 0: Yep.

808
00:47:01,431 --> 00:47:28,600
Speaker 0: But, I mean, that's kind of going over the years, though actually, when I was walking into the con, at the metro station, this is kind of funny, but I'm walking toward the metro station, like out, like, I think 20 miles away from the hotel, and I see this guy, and he's walking toward the metro station as well, and he had a bag with him, he didn't have any anime paraphernalia on at all, no anime t-shirt, nothing, just a dude, but I saw him, I immediately thought, that guy is a fanboy, he's going to Katsucon.

809
00:47:29,284 --> 00:47:31,532
Speaker 1: It's not hard to use the fanboy dar.

810
00:47:31,552 --> 00:47:33,997
Speaker 0: So I walked over to him, I'm like, you're going to Katsucon?

811
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:43,960
Speaker 0: He said yep, and we went together to Katsucon because I wasn't 100% sure about how to get the metro there right, so at least there were two of us, and if we got lost, I wasn't alone.

812
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:44,824
Speaker 1: That's good.

813
00:47:45,167 --> 00:47:51,600
Speaker 0: But I was talking to him, and he's definitely, it made me realize that there are essentially three generations of anime fans currently.

814
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:58,180
Speaker 0: Well, I guess four, because there's generation zero, you know, the guys who like discovered anime in the US.

815
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:05,919
Speaker 1: These are the people who are watching, uh, you know, things raw in the 70s with translations on a piece of paper in front of them.

816
00:48:06,241 --> 00:48:09,351
Speaker 0: Yeah, like, generation zero is like the earliest proto-fans.

817
00:48:09,614 --> 00:48:14,299
Speaker 1: They were watching old Gundams in Space Battleship Yamato, like, when the things came out.

818
00:48:15,002 --> 00:48:18,987
Speaker 0: But like, basically, I discovered, I realized that I am a second generation anime fan.

819
00:48:19,755 --> 00:48:23,350
Speaker 0: I mean, I came in when fan subs were around, digi subs didn't exist yet.

820
00:48:23,815 --> 00:48:28,160
Speaker 0: I mean, I was in fourth grade when I saw Vampire Hunter D for the first time, and that was when I got into anime.

821
00:48:28,921 --> 00:48:34,060
Speaker 0: But I've seen, like, every old classic, you know, been to the clubs, done the deal, I've been going to cons for years and years.

822
00:48:34,861 --> 00:48:41,574
Speaker 0: But then Thursday night at the bar, I ran into, you know, my old friend Tex, who's much older than me, and he is definitely a first generation anime fan.

823
00:48:41,615 --> 00:48:44,764
Speaker 1: Yeah, those guys like Star Blazers and Galaxies and whatever.

824
00:48:44,784 --> 00:48:45,189
Speaker 0: Yeah, all good stuff.

825
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:47,880
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm not disparaging any of these groups of anime fans.

826
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,715
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's just, you know, it's a whole different set of shows they like.

827
00:48:51,857 --> 00:48:55,070
Speaker 0: Yep, him and the guy who headed NekoCon, they were definitely the generation before me.

828
00:48:55,475 --> 00:49:01,292
Speaker 1: I think, isn't Lodos War, like, the line, like, before Lodos War is the old guys, and Lodos War and after is us?

829
00:49:01,696 --> 00:49:03,556
Speaker 0: Actually, you're not the first person to say that.

830
00:49:03,677 --> 00:49:03,819
Speaker 0: Yeah.

831
00:49:04,301 --> 00:49:06,565
Speaker 1: Well, that's 'cause I've heard people say that, that that's what the line is.

832
00:49:06,606 --> 00:49:14,788
Speaker 0: Yeah, 'cause Lodos War was fairly, the original OAV now, not the TV show, was fairly revolutionary when it came out in terms of the animation and everything about it.

833
00:49:15,636 --> 00:49:19,980
Speaker 0: If I'm not mistaken, I think it was the first anime to be commercially released in the US on DVD.

834
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,058
Speaker 1: It could be, I don't know, oh, DVD?

835
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:23,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, on DVD.

836
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:24,000
Speaker 1: Oh, who knows?

837
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:24,664
Speaker 1: Could be.

838
00:49:24,724 --> 00:49:32,987
Speaker 0: Because I remember it came out, like, way before I had a DVD player, and it was, like, half the cost of the VHS box set, and I wanted it so desperately.

839
00:49:33,149 --> 00:49:34,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll have to check that out.

840
00:49:34,503 --> 00:49:35,493
Speaker 0: Yeah, like, I'm not sure.

841
00:49:35,513 --> 00:49:36,422
Speaker 0: That's just my congestion.

842
00:49:36,442 --> 00:49:38,440
Speaker 1: That's the kind of something Anime World Order would just know.

843
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:43,273
Speaker 0: Yeah, so maybe they'll call in, give us some feedback, and say, "No, it was actually blah blah blah blah blah blah

844
00:49:43,294 --> 00:49:43,395
Speaker 0: blah.".

845
00:49:43,537 --> 00:49:43,700
Speaker 0: Yeah.

846
00:49:44,682 --> 00:49:48,000
Speaker 0: But, this kid that I met was definitely of the third generation.

847
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:49,939
Speaker 0: 'Cause it's cool, I'm talking to him.

848
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:51,453
Speaker 0: Then he asks me, "What anime do you

849
00:49:51,493 --> 00:49:51,675
Speaker 0: like?".

850
00:49:52,261 --> 00:49:57,897
Speaker 0: So I say, "Well, right now I'm watching Mushishi, and I just finally caught Last Exile, a little late on

851
00:49:57,937 --> 00:49:58,099
Speaker 0: that.".

852
00:49:58,342 --> 00:50:02,319
Speaker 0: And he's like, "Um, alright, never heard of

853
00:50:03,063 --> 00:50:03,549
Speaker 0: those.".

854
00:50:03,569 --> 00:50:04,380
Speaker 0: So I'm like, "Alright, fine.

855
00:50:04,982 --> 00:50:08,319
Speaker 0: I like, I don't know, Tena, Tyler, Cowboy Bebop,

856
00:50:10,027 --> 00:50:10,260
Speaker 0: Evangelion.".

857
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:11,917
Speaker 0: And he's just giving me this blank look the whole time.

858
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,103
Speaker 0: Escaflowne.

859
00:50:13,123 --> 00:50:15,528
Speaker 1: He didn't even know Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop?

860
00:50:15,649 --> 00:50:17,005
Speaker 1: Cowboy Bebop's on Cartoon Network.

861
00:50:17,106 --> 00:50:18,562
Speaker 0: He barely knew them.

862
00:50:18,906 --> 00:50:19,512
Speaker 0: What the hell?

863
00:50:19,815 --> 00:50:22,560
Speaker 0: So, like, any anime I named, he's like, "Eh,

864
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:23,789
Speaker 0: no.".

865
00:50:23,809 --> 00:50:25,185
Speaker 0: So finally, I'm like, "So what do you

866
00:50:25,205 --> 00:50:25,407
Speaker 0: watch?".

867
00:50:25,467 --> 00:50:26,699
Speaker 0: He's like, "Yeah, I watch Naruto,

868
00:50:27,785 --> 00:50:28,052
Speaker 0: etc.".

869
00:50:28,113 --> 00:50:28,966
Speaker 0: I forget what all he said.

870
00:50:28,986 --> 00:50:29,492
Speaker 0: It was Thursday.

871
00:50:29,512 --> 00:50:30,239
Speaker 0: It was a long time ago.

872
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:35,186
Speaker 1: Naruto, Dragon Ball Bleach, Shonen Fighting Show, Shonen Fighting Show.

873
00:50:35,206 --> 00:50:39,069
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess, it's sad, but I was watching anime before he went to school.

874
00:50:39,758 --> 00:50:39,900
Speaker 0: Yep.

875
00:50:41,001 --> 00:50:47,593
Speaker 0: And I, like, he still, he was a cool kid, and we talked a while, and I gave him a lot of recommendations of, "Totally watch this show and this show and this

876
00:50:47,613 --> 00:50:47,734
Speaker 0: show.".

877
00:50:47,775 --> 00:50:50,440
Speaker 0: But I probably mentioned, you know, a hundred shows, and he's not gonna watch them all.

878
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:51,267
Speaker 1: Not any of them.

879
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:52,460
Speaker 1: He probably won't remember a single one.

880
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:58,140
Speaker 0: But he was the first person I've ever met of this new generation of fans who watches anime at cons.

881
00:50:58,685 --> 00:51:03,499
Speaker 0: 'Cause he talked about how last year he watched all these shows at the con, and this year he was looking forward to a couple shows.

882
00:51:05,084 --> 00:51:07,011
Speaker 0: If I'd had a tape recorder, I would've interviewed him about it.

883
00:51:07,032 --> 00:51:16,599
Speaker 0: 'Cause the only things I watch at cons, to get back to my topic of watching anime at the cons, are usually the, like, Cantonese live-action movies that I can't get anywhere.

884
00:51:17,103 --> 00:51:17,760
Speaker 1: Yep, those are the best.

885
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,516
Speaker 0: Or, like, the premiere anime movies.

886
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,291
Speaker 0: Every now and then, they'll premiere something at a con.

887
00:51:21,594 --> 00:51:25,594
Speaker 1: Yeah, like, when they show, sometimes I think they show Appleseed in an Otacon.

888
00:51:25,796 --> 00:51:26,160
Speaker 0: Yep, yep.

889
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:28,828
Speaker 1: I watched Hero at an Otacon before it was in movie theaters.

890
00:51:28,869 --> 00:51:29,537
Speaker 1: That was a good one.

891
00:51:29,557 --> 00:51:29,719
Speaker 1: Yep.

892
00:51:29,941 --> 00:51:32,040
Speaker 0: Or that hard-to-find stuff, like, SARS Wars.

893
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:36,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, the stuff that just, like, so... You didn't know it existed.

894
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:38,585
Speaker 1: There's no way you could've found it or known to look for it.

895
00:51:38,908 --> 00:51:42,080
Speaker 1: But someone at a con is that guy that works for the con.

896
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:47,736
Speaker 1: You don't know who he is, but he gets this crazy lineup of stuff that's so obscure, but so great.

897
00:51:47,777 --> 00:51:50,260
Speaker 1: And you just have to go and take in what this guy has to offer.

898
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:50,823
Speaker 0: Yep.

899
00:51:50,863 --> 00:51:55,134
Speaker 0: You know, like, the live-action room at Otacon every year always has, like, just the crazy movies.

900
00:51:55,356 --> 00:51:55,498
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

901
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,580
Speaker 0: And Katsucon was no exception.

902
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:01,760
Speaker 0: And I'm a huge Lupin the Third fan, and so is Scott.

903
00:52:02,766 --> 00:52:04,666
Speaker 1: Everyone should be a huge Lupin the Third fan.

904
00:52:04,707 --> 00:52:07,434
Speaker 1: If you're not, or you don't think you are, you are.

905
00:52:07,475 --> 00:52:08,344
Speaker 1: You just don't know it yet.

906
00:52:08,445 --> 00:52:09,639
Speaker 0: We love Lupin.

907
00:52:10,161 --> 00:52:14,199
Speaker 0: We've seen at least 75% of all the Lupin movies that exist.

908
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:14,724
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

909
00:52:15,375 --> 00:52:19,131
Speaker 0: Yet, there's a Lupin movie that I had never heard of and did not know existed.

910
00:52:19,717 --> 00:52:21,434
Speaker 0: And it was shown at Katsucon.

911
00:52:21,878 --> 00:52:25,559
Speaker 0: It was called Lupin the Third Strange Psychokinetic Strategy.

912
00:52:26,122 --> 00:52:32,869
Speaker 1: That's a crazy name for a--usually they have more sane names, not, you know, like Assassin something, or Legend of something.

913
00:52:32,889 --> 00:52:39,800
Speaker 0: It was made in 1974, and I linked to it as my thing of the day, because it's live-action.

914
00:52:40,701 --> 00:52:41,659
Speaker 1: Alright, so who was Lupin?

915
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:42,868
Speaker 0: Oh, frickin' I don't know.

916
00:52:43,009 --> 00:52:44,424
Speaker 0: Actors from the '70s I've never heard of.

917
00:52:44,646 --> 00:52:46,485
Speaker 1: Did he have a big fro, or did he have a-- No, no, no.

918
00:52:46,626 --> 00:52:48,667
Speaker 0: It was--they all looked right.

919
00:52:48,869 --> 00:52:50,343
Speaker 0: Every character looked the way they should.

920
00:52:50,363 --> 00:52:56,687
Speaker 0: Now, it wasn't done the way you'd think, you know, maybe a serious live-action, or a different take on Lupin.

921
00:52:57,091 --> 00:52:58,626
Speaker 0: It's exactly like the cartoon.

922
00:52:59,554 --> 00:53:00,889
Speaker 1: So was it like Roger Rabbit?

923
00:53:01,374 --> 00:53:01,820
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

924
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:09,159
Speaker 0: It was totally live-action, but right down to the stupid anime-style comedic BS that you see in every Lupin.

925
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:11,960
Speaker 0: I really can't explain it.

926
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:12,828
Speaker 0: You just have to see it.

927
00:53:13,192 --> 00:53:14,929
Speaker 0: Because I missed the first ten minutes of the movie.

928
00:53:15,857 --> 00:53:19,780
Speaker 1: I woke up-- Did he even have, like, crazy, impossible stuff, like cars driving on the side of buildings?

929
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:20,960
Speaker 0: Stuff like that, basically.

930
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:26,140
Speaker 1: Like, Lupin would be standing there-- Going on, like, cutting a plane in half and stuff?

931
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:26,866
Speaker 0: Yeah, stuff like that.

932
00:53:26,907 --> 00:53:36,319
Speaker 0: Like, Lupin would be standing there, and Fujiko's laying there, and he'd, like, stand like he's gonna dive into her like he always did in the anime, and then his clothes would just disappear.

933
00:53:38,082 --> 00:53:40,000
Speaker 0: And I really--you just have to see this movie.

934
00:53:40,522 --> 00:53:42,929
Speaker 0: If I find a way to get it, I will let you all know.

935
00:53:42,949 --> 00:53:45,111
Speaker 0: This movie was hilarious.

936
00:53:45,131 --> 00:53:46,894
Speaker 1: It has to be gettable if the con got it.

937
00:53:47,037 --> 00:53:47,199
Speaker 1: Yeah.

938
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:48,850
Speaker 0: Well, SARS Wars was here.

939
00:53:48,891 --> 00:53:50,405
Speaker 0: I still can't get SARS Wars anywhere.

940
00:53:50,587 --> 00:53:51,214
Speaker 1: We can get that.

941
00:53:51,254 --> 00:53:51,800
Speaker 1: That's not hard.

942
00:53:52,021 --> 00:53:53,395
Speaker 0: I asked two dealers in the dealer's room.

943
00:53:53,415 --> 00:53:55,173
Speaker 0: Neither one of them had even heard of SARS Wars.

944
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:55,699
Speaker 1: We'll get it.

945
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:56,304
Speaker 1: We'll get it.

946
00:53:56,405 --> 00:54:01,478
Speaker 0: The funny thing was, both of them said that they had been asked about it multiple times, and they're gonna look into it.

947
00:54:01,981 --> 00:54:02,183
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

948
00:54:03,538 --> 00:54:10,040
Speaker 0: But, I actually was late to this, 'cause I woke up late, and since we were, you know, on the first floor, Scott Johnson just got dressed and ran downstairs to the movie.

949
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:17,960
Speaker 0: While I'm showering, he calls my cell phone three times in the span of a minute, yelling at me to come down and see this movie.

950
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:19,313
Speaker 0: It's the best thing he's ever seen.

951
00:54:19,394 --> 00:54:19,920
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

952
00:54:20,101 --> 00:54:20,635
Speaker 0: Oh my god!

953
00:54:22,083 --> 00:54:24,920
Speaker 0: And sure enough, it was, it was fantastic.

954
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:26,770
Speaker 1: So you didn't even see the whole thing.

955
00:54:26,791 --> 00:54:27,740
Speaker 1: You missed the beginning part.

956
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:33,559
Speaker 0: I missed the very beginning, but apparently it goes into early, early, early Lupin backstory that I didn't know.

957
00:54:34,624 --> 00:54:36,384
Speaker 0: It talks a little bit about Lupin the Second.

958
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:37,460
Speaker 1: Lupin the Second?

959
00:54:38,081 --> 00:54:39,739
Speaker 0: And, Jigen meets Lupin.

960
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:40,711
Speaker 0: Holy crap.

961
00:54:41,239 --> 00:54:42,640
Speaker 0: And, it's awesome.

962
00:54:43,601 --> 00:54:43,803
Speaker 0: Alright.

963
00:54:44,147 --> 00:54:44,450
Speaker 0: See it.

964
00:54:44,834 --> 00:54:45,611
Speaker 0: See it, see it, see it.

965
00:54:47,322 --> 00:54:50,047
Speaker 1: You should see anything that says Lupin on it, no matter what it is.

966
00:54:50,168 --> 00:54:53,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, the worst Lupin ever made is Babylon Gold.

967
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:55,360
Speaker 0: And even that is worth watching.

968
00:54:55,480 --> 00:55:00,900
Speaker 1: It's worth watching just so you believe us when we say that motorcycles drive around on clown faces.

969
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,353
Speaker 0: Yeah, the opening scene of that movie.

970
00:55:02,373 --> 00:55:02,960
Speaker 1: Think, wait, wait, wait.

971
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,240
Speaker 1: Motorcycles on clown faces.

972
00:55:07,603 --> 00:55:08,290
Speaker 1: Think about that.

973
00:55:09,018 --> 00:55:11,584
Speaker 1: Now, whatever you're thinking, that's not right.

974
00:55:11,786 --> 00:55:12,857
Speaker 1: That's not what you're gonna see.

975
00:55:12,897 --> 00:55:14,699
Speaker 1: You're gonna see something even crazier.

976
00:55:15,361 --> 00:55:17,685
Speaker 1: But it's still gonna be motorcycles on clown faces.

977
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:22,148
Speaker 0: Oh, that made me think of one of the AMVs was to Utena.

978
00:55:22,714 --> 00:55:23,482
Speaker 0: Not the one I talked about.

979
00:55:23,502 --> 00:55:24,840
Speaker 0: that was awesome, another one that was okay.

980
00:55:25,581 --> 00:55:29,644
Speaker 0: And this AMV basically follows the plot of the Utena movie all the way through.

981
00:55:29,664 --> 00:55:36,478
Speaker 0: And, unlike most Utena AMVs, it goes from cool serious to showing the naked cars.

982
00:55:37,106 --> 00:55:37,207
Speaker 0: Ah.

983
00:55:38,339 --> 00:55:42,860
Speaker 0: And, all Scott Johnson's friends who were sitting with us there had never seen the Utena movie.

984
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:44,320
Speaker 1: They never saw the naked cars?

985
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,974
Speaker 0: They'd never seen much Utena.

986
00:55:46,115 --> 00:55:49,548
Speaker 1: Oh, if you don't know, the Utena movie is way different from the TV show.

987
00:55:50,033 --> 00:55:51,892
Speaker 1: And at the end of it, there are naked cars.

988
00:55:52,175 --> 00:55:54,380
Speaker 0: Now, you might wonder, what's a naked car?

989
00:55:54,821 --> 00:55:58,640
Speaker 1: Well, if you watch the end of the Utena movie, you will see a naked car.

990
00:55:58,881 --> 00:56:01,144
Speaker 0: You'll be thinking the whole time, "Naked car?

991
00:56:01,204 --> 00:56:01,507
Speaker 0: What the

992
00:56:01,547 --> 00:56:01,829
Speaker 0: hell?".

993
00:56:02,031 --> 00:56:15,040
Speaker 1: As in, as in vroom, vroom, let's go Ferrari Enzo, naked like Lupin, naked like no clothing, no clothing, vroom, vroom, internal combustion engine Indy 500.

994
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,767
Speaker 0: So, there have been like three Utena videos already.

995
00:56:18,232 --> 00:56:21,546
Speaker 0: And they keep turning to us like, "Wow, this Utena show actually looks like it might be worth

996
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:21,890
Speaker 0: watching.".

997
00:56:22,456 --> 00:56:25,383
Speaker 0: Or like, "Wow, I didn't think that show was serious or

998
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:25,706
Speaker 0: good.".

999
00:56:26,858 --> 00:56:29,931
Speaker 0: And then this video comes on, and they're watching it, and it's going.

1000
00:56:30,296 --> 00:56:33,526
Speaker 0: And then, the naked car thing happens, and the video keeps going.

1001
00:56:34,212 --> 00:56:36,918
Speaker 0: And they turn to look at me like, "What the hell kind of show is

1002
00:56:37,141 --> 00:56:37,403
Speaker 0: this?".

1003
00:56:37,424 --> 00:56:41,419
Speaker 0: And Scott and I are just laughing our asses off.

1004
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:45,807
Speaker 1: Naked cars in the movie, oh yeah.

1005
00:56:46,454 --> 00:56:48,191
Speaker 0: So, I hope that was coherent.

1006
00:56:48,857 --> 00:56:56,859
Speaker 0: I'm quite sick, as you might have gathered from the previous several podcasts, and I'm probably going to pass out and not go to work tomorrow after this show.

1007
00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:03,726
Speaker 0: But, in some, other than that one tiny thing about the crap panel, Katsucon was freaking amazing.

1008
00:57:04,514 --> 00:57:10,459
Speaker 0: And if any of you need an anime con to go to and can't make it to Otacon, Katsucon is right up there in terms of awesome.

1009
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:16,919
Speaker 1: Uh, in geography terms, DC, I mean, if you're close enough to go to Katsucon, you're probably going to Otacon.

1010
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:17,723
Speaker 1: You know?

1011
00:57:17,743 --> 00:57:19,020
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, I mean, it was weird.

1012
00:57:19,801 --> 00:57:24,090
Speaker 0: I drove past Otacon, or where Otacon is, to get to Katsucon.

1013
00:57:24,494 --> 00:57:27,588
Speaker 0: And I honestly, I was driving, and I saw Inner Harbor Exit.

1014
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:28,840
Speaker 0: And I got into the right lane.

1015
00:57:29,482 --> 00:57:31,408
Speaker 0: And then I realized, wait a minute, I'm not going to Otacon.

1016
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,279
Speaker 0: And I got out of the right lane.

1017
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:33,647
Speaker 0: And then I drove another 30 miles.

1018
00:57:33,667 --> 00:57:35,404
Speaker 1: That's the only time we ever really go down that way.

1019
00:57:35,425 --> 00:57:35,506
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1020
00:57:36,031 --> 00:57:42,173
Speaker 1: You know, one day, we're going to go past there, and we're going to go past Katsucon, and we're going to go to, like, Florida or something.

1021
00:57:42,294 --> 00:57:42,800
Speaker 1: All the way.

1022
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,780
Speaker 0: Actually, I'm going to Animazement in, uh, later this year.

1023
00:57:46,981 --> 00:57:47,467
Speaker 1: Where is that?

1024
00:57:47,852 --> 00:57:48,500
Speaker 0: Uh, North Carolina.

1025
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:49,749
Speaker 1: No, that's not Florida.

1026
00:57:49,991 --> 00:57:50,173
Speaker 1: No.

1027
00:57:50,294 --> 00:57:52,132
Speaker 1: But it's still the same highway going past.

1028
00:57:52,334 --> 00:57:53,487
Speaker 0: It is, though I might just fly.

1029
00:57:53,771 --> 00:57:54,439
Speaker 1: That's a good plan.

1030
00:57:55,281 --> 00:57:57,526
Speaker 0: But, I mean, to sum up, Katsucon is amazing.

1031
00:57:57,546 --> 00:57:58,880
Speaker 0: Katsucon 12 was fantastic.

1032
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:00,439
Speaker 0: The staff were amazing.

1033
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:04,040
Speaker 0: Despite the fact that there was a crazy crowd, they managed it well.

1034
00:58:04,901 --> 00:58:05,002
Speaker 0: Oh!

1035
00:58:05,245 --> 00:58:06,379
Speaker 0: Alright, I have one last thing.

1036
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,415
Speaker 0: I almost forgot, because I didn't write out my own bullshit.

1037
00:58:08,435 --> 00:58:10,380
Speaker 1: I'm sure you forgot a lot of other things, so just, whatever.

1038
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:14,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I talked earlier about the staff of the con and how I interviewed them.

1039
00:58:15,748 --> 00:58:20,319
Speaker 0: Well, I got some on-the-record interviews, and I got some off-the-record interviews.

1040
00:58:21,303 --> 00:58:24,239
Speaker 0: And this ties into something that happened at the last Katsucon.

1041
00:58:24,905 --> 00:58:26,640
Speaker 0: And if you're a Republican, I'm sorry.

1042
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,509
Speaker 0: Alright, so I went around Sunday interviewing all these staff people.

1043
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:33,238
Speaker 0: I interviewed the head of security at the hotel.

1044
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,008
Speaker 0: Or at least he seemed like that.

1045
00:58:35,048 --> 00:58:36,563
Speaker 0: He was at least a big, high-up security guy.

1046
00:58:37,229 --> 00:58:40,843
Speaker 0: I interviewed one of the concierge guys, and I interviewed, like, four of the cleaning ladies.

1047
00:58:40,863 --> 00:58:43,349
Speaker 1: Oh, so these were hotel staff, not Katsucon staff.

1048
00:58:43,369 --> 00:58:45,293
Speaker 0: No, not con staff, Omni Shoreham hotel staff.

1049
00:58:45,597 --> 00:58:45,820
Speaker 0: Okay.

1050
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:51,819
Speaker 0: I interviewed, like, three of the cleaning ladies, and I interviewed just random, like, hotel bellboy workers I saw.

1051
00:58:53,025 --> 00:58:59,009
Speaker 0: And without exception, they all basically said that they'd never seen anything like this before.

1052
00:58:59,837 --> 00:59:11,079
Speaker 0: They were really, they were amazed that despite the crowd and the yelling and the drunken rambling and the screaming and the costumes, nothing got broken, and everyone was actually really polite, and no one trashed the hotel.

1053
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:17,292
Speaker 0: Even the cleaning ladies said, "Yeah, rooms get messy when you cram, you know, eight or nine people into a

1054
00:59:17,372 --> 00:59:17,615
Speaker 0: room.".

1055
00:59:18,544 --> 00:59:21,038
Speaker 0: But we expected that, and it was no big deal.

1056
00:59:22,905 --> 00:59:24,645
Speaker 1: They do less cleaning when there's so many people.

1057
00:59:24,665 --> 00:59:25,838
Speaker 1: They just go, "Oh, no one will care.

1058
00:59:25,858 --> 00:59:26,444
Speaker 1: I'll clean it when they

1059
00:59:26,464 --> 00:59:26,646
Speaker 1: leave.".

1060
00:59:26,666 --> 00:59:30,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wish I had, I wish someday I'll play the tape if I ever get a tape recorder working.

1061
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:36,544
Speaker 0: Because the one concierge guy and the security guy interviewed them together, and they went on and on about how.

1062
00:59:36,766 --> 00:59:44,706
Speaker 0: it was just a great thing to see kids, you know, enjoying themselves in a in a non-drug, you know, non- violence, just kind of a, "Wow, these kids are doing something

1063
00:59:44,726 --> 00:59:44,969
Speaker 0: cool.".

1064
00:59:45,575 --> 00:59:49,214
Speaker 1: See, now here's the question is, you know, I'm not questioning whether they agreed with that or not.

1065
00:59:49,234 --> 00:59:56,199
Speaker 1: I'm questioning how much do these people say because they've been trained in hospitality ways as opposed to what they were really thinking, you know?

1066
00:59:56,682 --> 01:00:02,725
Speaker 1: There might have, I'm not saying there was like a huge gap, like they were actually, they weren't actually thinking, "These fucking kids, oh my god I want to kill them

1067
01:00:02,887 --> 01:00:03,008
Speaker 1: all.".

1068
01:00:03,392 --> 01:00:06,906
Speaker 1: But, you know, was their talk slightly slanted by their, uh...

1069
01:00:07,209 --> 01:00:17,018
Speaker 0: I would say definitely not because the people I interviewed who were definitely minimum wage workers, like guys rolling things like laundry around, they said the same thing.

1070
01:00:18,283 --> 01:00:23,377
Speaker 0: And two, I interviewed a lot of people on the record, and then off the record they basically said the same thing.

1071
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:29,719
Speaker 0: Except... Now, this wouldn't really be much of a story unless I gave you the story from last year.

1072
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:35,499
Speaker 0: Now at last Katsucon an unnamed member of our party clogged the toilet, and it wasn't me.

1073
01:00:36,021 --> 01:00:37,640
Speaker 1: Dum dum dum dum, did he plunge?

1074
01:00:38,261 --> 01:00:39,311
Speaker 0: There was no plunger in the room.

1075
01:00:39,331 --> 01:00:40,240
Speaker 1: Did he overflow?

1076
01:00:40,961 --> 01:00:46,647
Speaker 0: No, this wasn't like the other unnamed party who clogged our toilet at our house a month ago.

1077
01:00:47,151 --> 01:00:48,140
Speaker 0: You know who you are.

1078
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:49,120
Speaker 1: All of you, alright.

1079
01:00:50,502 --> 01:01:01,372
Speaker 0: So, we call this maintenance guy, this is a cool dude comes up, and he plunges, and while he's up there, I just ask him, like, "So hey, uh, what do you think of all these crazy, uh, anime kids here?

1080
01:01:01,615 --> 01:01:02,993
Speaker 0: They're not giving this hotel trouble, are

1081
01:01:03,013 --> 01:01:03,134
Speaker 0: they?".

1082
01:01:03,863 --> 01:01:08,768
Speaker 0: And without missing a beat, he looks at me and says, "Man, those young Republicans was here last week.

1083
01:01:09,191 --> 01:01:09,675
Speaker 0: You guys ain't

1084
01:01:09,716 --> 01:01:09,998
Speaker 0: nothing.".

1085
01:01:10,321 --> 01:01:11,759
Speaker 1: The young Republicans, you say?

1086
01:01:12,225 --> 01:01:13,400
Speaker 1: Causing the most trouble?

1087
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:17,660
Speaker 0: He said they trashed the hotel, and they were rude and horrible, and we laughed about that.

1088
01:01:17,721 --> 01:01:23,199
Speaker 1: I noticed a Republican, like, people who say identify themselves as, like, fierce Republicans are often rude.

1089
01:01:23,981 --> 01:01:26,505
Speaker 1: Like, I'm rude too, but I'm not a Republican, but...

1090
01:01:26,525 --> 01:01:40,669
Speaker 0: Well, I point out that I mean, we're saying Republicans in the party because I'm very conservative in a lot of ways, in a lot of my, uh, financial viewpoints and political viewpoints, but we're talking, like, young Republicans as in, basically, young Neocons nowadays.

1091
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:41,759
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seems, it's.

1092
01:01:41,881 --> 01:01:45,134
Speaker 1: it's, it's, it's not saying if you're rude you're Republican, that's backwards.

1093
01:01:45,256 --> 01:01:53,699
Speaker 1: It's, but it seems that many, if the majority of people who say they're Republicans are, are rude, and not in a good, not good rude like me.

1094
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:56,185
Speaker 0: Because I'm playing Phoenix Wright, I have to back this up.

1095
01:01:56,205 --> 01:01:59,759
Speaker 0: Now, I have one witness testimony, the janitor guy, who told me that.

1096
01:02:00,141 --> 01:02:00,283
Speaker 0: Mhm.

1097
01:02:00,485 --> 01:02:04,303
Speaker 0: So, fast forward to this year, Katsucon 12.

1098
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:10,633
Speaker 0: I'm interviewing all these people, and then I turn off the tape recorder, and I ask them, like, "So, off the record, uh, what do you

1099
01:02:10,653 --> 01:02:10,835
Speaker 0: think?".

1100
01:02:10,896 --> 01:02:11,986
Speaker 0: And they basically said the same thing.

1101
01:02:12,753 --> 01:02:14,692
Speaker 0: And then I asked a few of them, and here's the thing.

1102
01:02:15,419 --> 01:02:20,713
Speaker 0: One of, two different staff people brought this up on their own without prompting.

1103
01:02:21,198 --> 01:02:21,299
Speaker 1: Mhm.

1104
01:02:22,102 --> 01:02:31,140
Speaker 0: One guy, I asked him if the kids were trashing the rooms, and he said, "Well, we had the young Republicans here last week, and they destroyed the place.

1105
01:02:31,641 --> 01:02:32,550
Speaker 0: These kids are

1106
01:02:32,772 --> 01:02:33,176
Speaker 0: angels.".

1107
01:02:33,923 --> 01:02:34,145
Speaker 0: Mhm.

1108
01:02:34,954 --> 01:02:40,815
Speaker 0: And this was just, like, some maintenance guy walking around, like, 'cause I actually, I got drunk Saturday night, and I wandered down.

1109
01:02:40,835 --> 01:02:43,640
Speaker 0: There's, like, a, there's, like, three levels of sub-basements under the hotel.

1110
01:02:43,982 --> 01:02:45,200
Speaker 1: You went into the sub-basements?

1111
01:02:45,421 --> 01:02:48,167
Speaker 0: I was just wandering around down there in a drunken haze, like, 2 a.m.

1112
01:02:48,208 --> 01:02:48,773
Speaker 0: on Saturday.

1113
01:02:48,793 --> 01:02:49,197
Speaker 1: Oh, great.

1114
01:02:50,001 --> 01:02:52,046
Speaker 0: And I ran into all, like, all these various staff people.

1115
01:02:52,066 --> 01:02:56,186
Speaker 0: They were cool, and I talked to 'em, and I, I have the tape of the interview, so I'm not making this stuff up.

1116
01:02:56,590 --> 01:02:56,671
Speaker 1: Mhm.

1117
01:02:57,338 --> 01:03:01,620
Speaker 0: But, then, another guy who didn't wish to be named basically said the same thing.

1118
01:03:01,741 --> 01:03:04,590
Speaker 0: I was asking about, you know, how, how's the hotel handling this?

1119
01:03:04,913 --> 01:03:06,004
Speaker 0: Are these kids welcome back?

1120
01:03:06,832 --> 01:03:10,918
Speaker 0: And he said, basically, that, yeah, they're welcome back, especially after who we had last week.

1121
01:03:12,301 --> 01:03:13,860
Speaker 0: So I asked him, "Wait a minute.

1122
01:03:14,341 --> 01:03:15,175
Speaker 0: Who did you have last

1123
01:03:15,236 --> 01:03:15,399
Speaker 0: week?".

1124
01:03:15,723 --> 01:03:16,854
Speaker 0: And he said, "I'm not at liberty to

1125
01:03:16,894 --> 01:03:17,137
Speaker 0: say.".

1126
01:03:17,722 --> 01:03:21,497
Speaker 0: And then I asked him, "Well, I talked to some other guy, and he said the young Republicans were here last

1127
01:03:21,558 --> 01:03:21,699
Speaker 0: week.".

1128
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:22,639
Speaker 0: And the guy laughed.

1129
01:03:23,803 --> 01:03:25,964
Speaker 0: And then he said, "They have a reputation around the hotels

1130
01:03:26,004 --> 01:03:26,166
Speaker 0: here.".

1131
01:03:28,207 --> 01:03:31,420
Speaker 0: So, I'm not, I'm sorry if you're a Republican.

1132
01:03:31,501 --> 01:03:41,380
Speaker 0: I don't think that many conservative Republican types listen to geek nights, and if you do, I guess you know by now that we're not very, uh, quiet about our various viewpoints on things.

1133
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,739
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we hate those, uh, dirty hippies as much as you do.

1134
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:47,004
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1135
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:48,149
Speaker 1: At least I do.

1136
01:03:48,169 --> 01:03:49,745
Speaker 1: But, dirty hippies.

1137
01:03:50,048 --> 01:03:55,420
Speaker 0: I just found it hilarious that two katsu kansu in a row, the young Republicans were there the weekend before us and trashed the hotel.

1138
01:03:55,921 --> 01:03:56,164
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1139
01:03:56,508 --> 01:03:58,248
Speaker 0: I think that says a lot about the young Republicans.

1140
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:08,993
Speaker 1: You know, it actually makes me think, you know, there seems to be a lot of internet and blogs and podcasts going around, uh, about, like, the insides of different industries.

1141
01:04:09,033 --> 01:04:17,277
Speaker 1: Like, there are a bunch of pilot things where pilots have their inside pilot talk, you know, and like, tech support guys have their inside tech support talk.

1142
01:04:17,317 --> 01:04:20,164
Speaker 1: And we saw that forum, that great forum with the inside- It's gone now.

1143
01:04:20,205 --> 01:04:20,812
Speaker 0: They took it down.

1144
01:04:21,339 --> 01:04:23,036
Speaker 1: Aww, with the emergency room talk?

1145
01:04:23,218 --> 01:04:23,460
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1146
01:04:23,741 --> 01:04:24,711
Speaker 1: Oh, that was the best.

1147
01:04:24,792 --> 01:04:25,034
Speaker 0: I know.

1148
01:04:25,054 --> 01:04:27,360
Speaker 0: I tried to link Scott Johnson to it, and he said the link's broken.

1149
01:04:27,562 --> 01:04:27,986
Speaker 0: I said, "What the

1150
01:04:28,006 --> 01:04:28,208
Speaker 0: hell?"

1151
01:04:28,248 --> 01:04:29,420
Speaker 0: And I followed it, and it was removed.

1152
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:38,854
Speaker 1: No, there's a great, uh, a bunch of pre-med students who had to work in emergency rooms were telling great stories about all the stuff that you see in an emergency room.

1153
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:42,106
Speaker 1: And it's like the inside jokes, you couldn't even tell what they were talking about half the time.

1154
01:04:42,126 --> 01:04:42,510
Speaker 1: Yep.

1155
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:47,844
Speaker 0: Unless you knew about it, but- But basically, apparently, no one ever gets beaten up by just one guy.

1156
01:04:47,865 --> 01:04:49,099
Speaker 0: It's always two dudes.

1157
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:52,449
Speaker 1: And the most dangerous thing you can possibly do is sock mob.

1158
01:04:52,631 --> 01:04:53,196
Speaker 1: Standing on a corner.

1159
01:04:53,216 --> 01:04:53,640
Speaker 1: Standing on a corner.

1160
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:54,780
Speaker 1: Mind your own business.

1161
01:04:55,724 --> 01:05:04,600
Speaker 1: So, no, but hotel people are really, and it's like, you know, uh, job, you know, working in a hotel doesn't tend to be like a high-class, high-paying job.

1162
01:05:05,144 --> 01:05:10,460
Speaker 1: And those people, you know, tend not to be super internet-savvy bloggers, podcasters.

1163
01:05:11,121 --> 01:05:16,560
Speaker 1: So it'd be, it'd be really cool to go around and, like, get the inside stories from those kind of jobs.

1164
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:22,680
Speaker 1: You know, people who aren't super internet-savvy where their inside stuff isn't getting out and entertaining people.

1165
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:24,180
Speaker 1: Stuff like, I don't know, plumbers.

1166
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:26,096
Speaker 1: You know, that kind of stuff isn't out there.

1167
01:05:26,116 --> 01:05:28,700
Speaker 1: There's no inside plumbing, funny plumbing stories.

1168
01:05:29,121 --> 01:05:30,900
Speaker 1: No inside, funny hotel stories.

1169
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:34,440
Speaker 1: You know, so if we can reveal that stuff, that'd be pretty cool.

1170
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:36,780
Speaker 0: So I'm hereby starting a contest.

1171
01:05:38,128 --> 01:05:46,099
Speaker 0: If KatsuKan13 has young Republicans the weekend before it, I'm not sure what I'm gonna do, but there's gonna be a contest involving that.

1172
01:05:46,781 --> 01:05:48,519
Speaker 1: How are we gonna have a contest involving that?

1173
01:05:49,043 --> 01:05:49,833
Speaker 0: I'll come up with something.

1174
01:05:49,853 --> 01:05:50,319
Speaker 0: I got a year.

1175
01:05:51,244 --> 01:06:16,660
Speaker 1: I'll tell you what, if you, if if the young Republicans are there the week before KatsuKan13 and you go and see the young Republicans and get, I don't know, some pictures or something to show how, you know, crazy they are, or a recording or anything so that we can put it on a podcast or a website or anything, then I don't know, we'll pay for you to get into the KatsuKan.

1176
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:17,124
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1177
01:06:17,528 --> 01:06:17,812
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1178
01:06:17,973 --> 01:06:18,539
Speaker 1: Something like that.

1179
01:06:18,721 --> 01:06:23,025
Speaker 0: We'll do something, because a year from now we'll probably have a lot more resources to dole out to Geek Nights.

1180
01:06:23,248 --> 01:06:23,612
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1181
01:06:24,057 --> 01:06:28,054
Speaker 1: Maybe resources from someone else as opposed to from our work.

1182
01:06:28,376 --> 01:06:30,680
Speaker 0: Well, actually we had one guy offer to donate money to us.

1183
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,239
Speaker 0: He asked us why we didn't have a PayPal button.

1184
01:06:32,641 --> 01:06:33,892
Speaker 1: Because we have jobs.

1185
01:06:34,478 --> 01:06:34,700
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1186
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:36,500
Speaker 1: Unlike a lot of podcasts.

1187
01:06:37,121 --> 01:06:40,035
Speaker 0: All told, this podcast costs us less than, like, 400 bucks.

1188
01:06:40,661 --> 01:06:42,280
Speaker 0: And that includes, like, the hosting and everything.

1189
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:44,196
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was paying for the hosting anyway.

1190
01:06:44,217 --> 01:06:45,873
Speaker 1: I haven't changed my hosting payment.

1191
01:06:45,954 --> 01:06:48,376
Speaker 0: Yeah, and we're buying new hosting just for the MP3s.

1192
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:51,084
Speaker 0: That's gonna cost, like, 15 bucks a month.

1193
01:06:51,367 --> 01:06:52,942
Speaker 1: No, it's gonna cost, like, 30 or 40.

1194
01:06:52,942 --> 01:06:54,865
Speaker 0: No, I added up.

1195
01:06:54,885 --> 01:06:56,480
Speaker 0: We don't need that much space for the podcast.

1196
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:57,732
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think we do.

1197
01:06:57,753 --> 01:06:59,445
Speaker 1: But anyway, still.

1198
01:07:00,133 --> 01:07:01,709
Speaker 0: Unless we keep doing long ones like this.

1199
01:07:01,931 --> 01:07:02,759
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's still cheap.

1200
01:07:03,421 --> 01:07:04,520
Speaker 1: We have plenty of money.

1201
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:04,963
Speaker 1: We're good.

1202
01:07:06,054 --> 01:07:07,467
Speaker 0: Yeah, we moved into some meta bits there.

1203
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:08,840
Speaker 0: KatsuKan 12 was awesome.

1204
01:07:09,804 --> 01:07:12,640
Speaker 0: If I remember anything to say about it, I'll do it real quick tomorrow.

1205
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:19,390
Speaker 0: I'll just say that I kind of skipped on because it was deleted from the other podcast.

1206
01:07:19,794 --> 01:07:26,520
Speaker 0: But the basic summation of all that was that I saw at least 50 or 60 DSs, like, in active use.

1207
01:07:26,964 --> 01:07:29,287
Speaker 0: And I played DS stuff with people all con.

1208
01:07:30,116 --> 01:07:33,760
Speaker 0: I saw no more than two PSPs in the entire convention.

1209
01:07:34,863 --> 01:07:40,119
Speaker 0: And I'm possibly certain that it was actually the same guy I saw both times.

1210
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:42,620
Speaker 1: So it was one PSP and you saw him twice.

1211
01:07:42,822 --> 01:07:44,200
Speaker 1: But you were drunk the second time, I think.

1212
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:48,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I wasn't sure if it was the same guy or if there were two PSPs at the con.

1213
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:53,780
Speaker 0: But everywhere you look, there was a little, like, cabal of, like, four or five kids playing Mario Kart or Bomberman.

1214
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:55,420
Speaker 0: Just all over the con, constantly.

1215
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:57,755
Speaker 1: We should just have DS conventions.

1216
01:07:57,816 --> 01:08:01,759
Speaker 1: Everyone with a DS come here and will just keep playing games until the weekend's over.

1217
01:08:02,101 --> 01:08:03,513
Speaker 0: And the PSP guy sat down.

1218
01:08:03,533 --> 01:08:05,371
Speaker 0: We were all playing Mario Kart and he sat down with us.

1219
01:08:05,856 --> 01:08:07,632
Speaker 0: And he starts, everyone looks up at him.

1220
01:08:07,652 --> 01:08:11,371
Speaker 0: And this one kid sitting with us asks him, like, "Why the hell did you buy a PSP?

1221
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,278
Speaker 0: There's no games for

1222
01:08:12,358 --> 01:08:12,398
Speaker 0: it.".

1223
01:08:13,142 --> 01:08:13,971
Speaker 0: And the guy was great.

1224
01:08:13,992 --> 01:08:15,995
Speaker 0: Because with a straight face he says, "I got games.

1225
01:08:16,055 --> 01:08:16,907
Speaker 0: I got a freaking Nintendo

1226
01:08:16,968 --> 01:08:17,434
Speaker 0: emulator.".

1227
01:08:19,323 --> 01:08:20,292
Speaker 0: And then he said, "I wish I bought a

1228
01:08:20,313 --> 01:08:20,616
Speaker 0: DS.".

1229
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:21,216
Speaker 1: Yep.

1230
01:08:23,622 --> 01:08:24,169
Speaker 1: What's he gonna do?

1231
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:25,020
Speaker 1: He could sell it back.

1232
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:27,368
Speaker 0: Well, I guess, I mean, the PSP doesn't seem to be a gaming system.

1233
01:08:27,408 --> 01:08:34,300
Speaker 0: It's definitely a useful bit of technology for, you know, movie watching and podcast listening and all that stuff.

1234
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:35,698
Speaker 0: But there's really no games for it yet.

1235
01:08:37,265 --> 01:08:40,260
Speaker 1: I mean, it does, it's actually a little better than the iPod for podcast listening.

1236
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:46,685
Speaker 1: Because it has Wi-Fi, so you can use it to actually download the podcast direct to itself, and you don't need to sync with a computer or anything.

1237
01:08:46,926 --> 01:08:48,299
Speaker 0: Yep, in fact, one of our listeners...

1238
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:49,899
Speaker 1: That's the one thing I wish the iPod did.

1239
01:08:50,421 --> 01:08:54,319
Speaker 0: One of our listeners a while ago gave us great instructions on how to do that in a previous episode.

1240
01:08:54,560 --> 01:09:01,533
Speaker 1: Yeah, because imagine if I'm driving down the highway and a new episode of a podcast comes out and I just get it, instead of having to get to work, update, get home.

1241
01:09:01,856 --> 01:09:09,430
Speaker 1: Right now, every day before I go to work, because I want to have a podcast in the car, I have to wake up and manually update the stupid iPod before I leave.

1242
01:09:09,671 --> 01:09:10,500
Speaker 1: It's really annoying.

1243
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:12,700
Speaker 1: You know, I wish it would just be updated.

1244
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:18,742
Speaker 0: So, I can guarantee to you that Geek Nights, at least me, will be at KazuCon 13.

1245
01:09:18,742 --> 01:09:19,859
Speaker 1: I'll probably be there, I don't know.

1246
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:26,318
Speaker 0: And if you want to see us at another con, at least Scott, but possibly also myself and the other Scott, will be at the New York Comic Con.

1247
01:09:26,661 --> 01:09:35,519
Speaker 1: New York Comic Con, Jacob Javits Center, New York City, this Saturday... It's Friday, Saturday, Sunday, but I'm only probably going to go on Saturday.

1248
01:09:35,903 --> 01:09:42,898
Speaker 1: I'll probably go all day Saturday, from beginning to end, but yeah, this Saturday, New York Javits Center, Comic Con.

1249
01:09:43,484 --> 01:09:44,779
Speaker 0: And hopefully I won't be sick by then.

1250
01:09:45,421 --> 01:09:55,399
Speaker 1: And possibly, the Saturday after the Comic Con, there is the non-con Vassar in Poughkeepsie, New York.

1251
01:09:55,820 --> 01:10:03,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, I used to live next to Vassar, and not to disparage them, it seems like a nice school, their anime club is scary.

1252
01:10:04,247 --> 01:10:09,158
Speaker 1: Yeah, so they're having a little tiny con, like on the scale of a college con, you know.

1253
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:16,891
Speaker 0: However, we've got basically all of our idiot friends from all over the world, or at least all over you know, RIT and around, are all coming to our house that weekend.

1254
01:10:17,174 --> 01:10:19,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I might go there on like Sunday for a day.

1255
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:21,439
Speaker 1: It's like a five, ten dollar con.

1256
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:22,830
Speaker 1: It's a half hour away, big deal.

1257
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:30,932
Speaker 0: If you're going to non-con, and you want to see us, let us know you're going, otherwise you probably won't run into us, because we're not going to be present there like we are at other cons.

1258
01:10:30,953 --> 01:10:34,227
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you're looking for us at non-con, look for Maws.

1259
01:10:34,511 --> 01:10:34,612
Speaker 0: Oh!

1260
01:10:35,139 --> 01:10:35,200
Speaker 0: Oh!

1261
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:37,320
Speaker 0: That's the last thing I got, and then we're out.

1262
01:10:37,521 --> 01:10:37,803
Speaker 0: Alright.

1263
01:10:38,126 --> 01:10:39,620
Speaker 0: So, I ran into.

1264
01:10:39,802 --> 01:10:41,620
Speaker 0: people have heard of Geek Nights at KatsuCon.

1265
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:42,530
Speaker 0: I ran into people.

1266
01:10:42,550 --> 01:10:43,280
Speaker 0: Holy crap.

1267
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:51,420
Speaker 0: Now the best part was, our friend Tex were in the bar Thursday night, and he turns to me, and he basically says, "Yes, you're doing that podcast,

1268
01:10:52,686 --> 01:10:52,787
Speaker 0: right?".

1269
01:10:52,808 --> 01:10:53,395
Speaker 0: And I'm like,

1270
01:10:53,436 --> 01:10:53,638
Speaker 0: "Yeah.".

1271
01:10:53,901 --> 01:11:02,125
Speaker 0: He says, "Yeah, one of the staffers I know calls me the other night like, 'There's these two guys, and I can't stop listening to them, and they're talking about KatsuCon.

1272
01:11:02,145 --> 01:11:02,973
Speaker 0: I think they're going to be

1273
01:11:03,033 --> 01:11:03,255
Speaker 0: there.'".

1274
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:05,967
Speaker 0: And Tex looks at her and says, "Wait a minute.

1275
01:11:06,754 --> 01:11:07,622
Speaker 0: I think I know those two

1276
01:11:07,682 --> 01:11:08,066
Speaker 0: fuckers.".

1277
01:11:08,854 --> 01:11:11,419
Speaker 1: And sure enough, he knows those two fuckers.

1278
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:12,469
Speaker 1: He knows everyone.

1279
01:11:12,490 --> 01:11:13,480
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1280
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:20,639
Speaker 1: If you don't know who Tex is, um, and you're at a con, ask us and we'll point at him, because I guarantee he'll be within invisible range.

1281
01:11:22,302 --> 01:11:23,863
Speaker 1: I mean, you got a one out of two shot of that.

1282
01:11:23,884 --> 01:11:26,247
Speaker 0: Alright, I'm going to go pass out on my bed and die.

1283
01:11:26,267 --> 01:11:26,792
Speaker 0: So, we're

1284
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:27,881
Speaker 0: out.".

1285
01:11:34,998 --> 01:11:37,153
Speaker 0: And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1286
01:11:37,375 --> 01:11:39,739
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

1293
01:12:03,335 --> 01:12:06,588
Speaker 1: Geek Nights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

1294
01:12:07,294 --> 01:12:10,293
Speaker 1: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
