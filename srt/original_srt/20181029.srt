Speaker 1: It's tonight.

5
00:00:18,697 --> 00:00:23,078
Speaker 1: We're talking about live streaming technology.

6
00:00:27,764 --> 00:00:28,797
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,562 --> 00:00:40,732
Speaker 1: Yeah, we didn't do shows for like two weeks because Scott and I had independent travel plans that did not overlap And in fact, we're such that we just couldn't do shows for two weeks.

8
00:00:40,852 --> 00:00:42,217
Speaker 0: I mean we could have squeezed one in.

9
00:00:42,499 --> 00:00:44,066
Speaker 1: yeah Not gonna.

10
00:00:44,347 --> 00:00:45,111
Speaker 0: Why would he bother?

11
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:45,774
Speaker 0: What's the point?

12
00:00:45,815 --> 00:00:46,799
Speaker 0: We're not getting paid for this shit.

13
00:00:48,242 --> 00:00:49,573
Speaker 1: Actually, we are from the patreon.

14
00:00:49,593 --> 00:00:50,339
Speaker 0: We don't have enough ideas.

15
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,848
Speaker 1: The thing is at this point.

16
00:00:53,968 --> 00:00:57,620
Speaker 1: We actually have a plethora of Tuesday and Wednesday shows.

17
00:00:58,242 --> 00:00:59,487
Speaker 1: Cuz we're actually watching.

18
00:00:59,507 --> 00:01:01,615
Speaker 0: animators have always been the easy show.

19
00:01:01,635 --> 00:01:06,840
Speaker 1: yep well And we have the plan to fix Thursdays and potentially Mondays with that new format.

20
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:15,618
Speaker 1: but I still have to do some work to set that up and I did not do that work because I was busy working on Some other stuff and actually I had to make a lot of slides for pecs unplugged.

21
00:01:15,638 --> 00:01:20,819
Speaker 0: anyway I can tell you tropical island means you can go to the beach in October.

22
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:27,182
Speaker 0: Warm and it's great and the water is salt water and it's wavy But it's not.

23
00:01:27,363 --> 00:01:28,547
Speaker 0: it's way less wavy.

24
00:01:28,567 --> 00:01:32,100
Speaker 1: I have not been to a tropical beach since I was in Costa Rica.

25
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,887
Speaker 0: It's also clear and blue and not dirty like New Jersey Yeah, and there's no.

26
00:01:38,988 --> 00:01:41,780
Speaker 0: there's no crabby's bite into the sand is just nice and smooth.

27
00:01:42,122 --> 00:01:44,659
Speaker 0: There's not a bunch of seaweed and other garbage down there.

28
00:01:45,424 --> 00:01:58,225
Speaker 0: It's pretty much just great, but the only thing is tropical islands at least the one I went to Greatly lack in nerdery there is unless you want to go to a casino Well, what do you expect?

29
00:01:58,266 --> 00:02:03,260
Speaker 1: what or what tropical beach town is gonna have anything nerdy for you to do at night?

30
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:06,493
Speaker 0: Well, I'm I think we you know, I want to make some sort of resort.

31
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:08,179
Speaker 0: That is like permanent joco cruise.

32
00:02:10,601 --> 00:02:11,223
Speaker 0: Let's be big.

33
00:02:11,263 --> 00:02:22,380
Speaker 0: it could be like, you know 100 rooms even smaller like 50 rooms, right just a little like motel sized Right, just something somewheres that a nerd at any time can go and a tropical nerdy vacation.

34
00:02:23,402 --> 00:02:28,547
Speaker 0: So, you know there was and if all the nerds in the world You should be able to keep the resort relatively full at all times.

35
00:02:28,888 --> 00:02:33,180
Speaker 1: Disney tried to do that with a nerdy like separate resort.

36
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,945
Speaker 0: I thought that was a Disney Cruise.

37
00:02:35,326 --> 00:02:36,791
Speaker 1: I know not cruises not cruises.

38
00:02:36,831 --> 00:02:38,035
Speaker 0: I'm sure Disney Resort.

39
00:02:38,295 --> 00:02:40,402
Speaker 1: No, these were not at Disney Uh-huh.

40
00:02:40,563 --> 00:02:41,929
Speaker 1: You'd you don't remember the do.

41
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:42,431
Speaker 1: Oh god.

42
00:02:42,471 --> 00:02:44,620
Speaker 1: What was it called Disney something?

43
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:55,035
Speaker 0: Disney I'm talking like during the day you go to the beach and then once the Sun Goes Down at this board games in the hotel You could probably make one of those.

44
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:55,780
Speaker 0: that's what I'm saying.

45
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,404
Speaker 0: Don't be big.

46
00:02:56,504 --> 00:02:59,000
Speaker 1: you probably make about as much money as like all those nerdy cat.

47
00:02:59,241 --> 00:03:01,113
Speaker 0: Basically just make as much money as any other is.

48
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:14,220
Speaker 1: just make a nerd Gaming store arcade II type place with tables and stuff and happen to put it at the beach Like those people who tried to make that land gaming plays in Wildwood that called no noobs that it just immediately went out of business.

49
00:03:14,782 --> 00:03:15,002
Speaker 0: Right.

50
00:03:15,704 --> 00:03:19,074
Speaker 0: This is like no people would fly and physically make reservations at your resort.

51
00:03:19,195 --> 00:03:33,493
Speaker 0: Unlike the land party place Nerd foot traffic cuz I would I'd rather if you were going on a tropical vacation where you just you're gonna go to a resort and just land a beach for a week and You discovered that somewhere on a tropical island near you.

52
00:03:33,934 --> 00:03:37,364
Speaker 0: There was a resort that had So one.

53
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:41,053
Speaker 0: there are no tropical islands near me relatively near.

54
00:03:41,842 --> 00:03:43,750
Speaker 0: Within five hours of flying and two.

55
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,240
Speaker 1: I wouldn't go to a tropical place to land a beach for a week.

56
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:52,303
Speaker 1: I'd go there for like two or three days and I'd go off somewhere else in the tropical area like into the rainforest or by The volcano.

57
00:03:52,504 --> 00:03:54,493
Speaker 0: there was no rainforest or volcano.

58
00:03:55,056 --> 00:03:55,940
Speaker 1: I should have gone to Costa Rica.

59
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,600
Speaker 0: There were some rock formations, but I figured those are not worth visiting.

60
00:04:00,361 --> 00:04:00,803
Speaker 1: How do you know?

61
00:04:00,863 --> 00:04:04,498
Speaker 1: watch that was like the most awesome thing one shaped like Sonic the Hedgehog or something?

62
00:04:04,518 --> 00:04:04,820
Speaker 1: I don't know.

63
00:04:04,941 --> 00:04:05,553
Speaker 0: I saw a picture.

64
00:04:08,804 --> 00:04:19,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess the trouble is that Resorts that are frequented by I don't say basic people but just like old people Normal people there were old people there during the day like beach like put me on any beach on earth.

65
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:22,233
Speaker 1: I know there's not toxic and I'm good to go.

66
00:04:22,253 --> 00:04:27,514
Speaker 0: I noticed at night Walking around in most of the rooms people were sitting and watching television.

67
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:28,979
Speaker 1: Oh, that's so sad.

68
00:04:29,481 --> 00:04:32,131
Speaker 0: They were at least I remember silly one night.

69
00:04:32,552 --> 00:04:38,760
Speaker 0: We're just like like well, we can't go to the beach anymore Just sitting next to the pool, which is also closed and then we walk back to the room.

70
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:40,066
Speaker 1: Why does the pool close?

71
00:04:40,086 --> 00:04:46,006
Speaker 1: when I was a kid and we went to like eight when we went to tropical play The beat the Is 24/7.

72
00:04:46,006 --> 00:04:50,580
Speaker 0: there was no lifeguard either at any time every beach resort like that.

73
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,439
Speaker 0: I've ever gone to no lifeguard on the beach or pool, but they closed the pool at 8.

74
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:59,192
Speaker 1: Wow The pool was open till like 2 in the morning and granted They were like drunken teenagers in the pool.

75
00:04:59,212 --> 00:05:10,140
Speaker 0: by close the pool I mean that around 830 to sometime between 830 and 9 some dude walks over it with a You know a sandwich board and puts it near the pool and it says sorry pool closed.

76
00:05:12,514 --> 00:05:15,476
Speaker 1: But Like putting any beach on earth like what we used to in wildwood during the day.

77
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:16,280
Speaker 1: just be on the beach all day.

78
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:16,664
Speaker 1: It's great.

79
00:05:16,745 --> 00:05:18,220
Speaker 1: Like that's that's the life I want.

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,469
Speaker 1: But what did I do at night?

81
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,677
Speaker 1: I played board games with all my friends.

82
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,120
Speaker 0: That's right.

83
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,206
Speaker 0: We need to do the same exact thing.

84
00:05:24,326 --> 00:05:26,111
Speaker 0: only bring more friends and more games.

85
00:05:26,532 --> 00:05:35,760
Speaker 1: I has sadly feel like the demographic overlap between Go to tropical island beach and want to stay inside playing board games.

86
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:38,432
Speaker 1: I feel like it's the opposite of a Venn diagram.

87
00:05:38,552 --> 00:05:43,735
Speaker 1: I is Joe go cruise full then One because it's not that big it sells out instantly.

88
00:05:43,795 --> 00:05:44,740
Speaker 0: It is fill the whole boat.

89
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,100
Speaker 1: I've heard it is way harder to get Joe go cruise than it is to get to packs.

90
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,534
Speaker 0: Well, I heard that they fill the whole boat now.

91
00:05:50,574 --> 00:05:51,783
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's big I'm.

92
00:05:51,944 --> 00:05:52,567
Speaker 1: uh, I want to go.

93
00:05:52,607 --> 00:05:54,999
Speaker 1: actually I want to go on it at least once like I'm so once.

94
00:05:55,059 --> 00:05:58,347
Speaker 1: yeah It's way hard to get on that thing.

95
00:05:58,407 --> 00:06:01,017
Speaker 1: It is it's it sells out faster than like SDCC's.

96
00:06:01,037 --> 00:06:01,379
Speaker 0: got on it.

97
00:06:01,781 --> 00:06:04,035
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got to got to know someone you got to go in like.

98
00:06:04,075 --> 00:06:04,659
Speaker 1: it's tough to do.

99
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:06,010
Speaker 1: We could try to do it.

100
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:06,837
Speaker 0: I'm sure we can get on.

101
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:07,260
Speaker 1: Yeah.

102
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,872
Speaker 1: So meanwhile I for the first time in my life I went to the op the literal opposite of a tropical island.

103
00:06:12,892 --> 00:06:14,838
Speaker 1: I went to Britain Albion.

104
00:06:14,978 --> 00:06:17,305
Speaker 1: Yeah But it was weird.

105
00:06:17,325 --> 00:06:17,868
Speaker 1: I've never.

106
00:06:17,888 --> 00:06:26,334
Speaker 1: I've been to London like 14 or so times Maybe more like it's to the point where I don't know how many times I've been there.

107
00:06:26,394 --> 00:06:31,520
Speaker 1: I'd have to go like count and I'd never been there where I didn't have work to do.

108
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:37,623
Speaker 1: Like I never just went to London with nothing to do and it was pretty novel to just wake up in London and be like What do you want to do?

109
00:06:38,084 --> 00:06:39,008
Speaker 1: Fucking whatever?

110
00:06:39,068 --> 00:06:40,414
Speaker 1: Let's just go crown jewels.

111
00:06:40,755 --> 00:06:44,129
Speaker 1: So the only know Well, you can just go see him.

112
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:44,853
Speaker 1: We were with you.

113
00:06:44,873 --> 00:06:45,738
Speaker 0: Why didn't you get him for me?

114
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,415
Speaker 1: Because there are heavily armed gentlemen who would have taken issue with that as your LuPone skills.

115
00:06:52,398 --> 00:06:53,924
Speaker 1: I ain't LuPone Why not?

116
00:06:54,265 --> 00:06:56,073
Speaker 1: So yeah, if you ever you've never been there, right?

117
00:06:56,093 --> 00:06:57,178
Speaker 1: You've never seen the crown jewels.

118
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,366
Speaker 0: No I've never even been to Europe.

119
00:06:59,748 --> 00:07:00,653
Speaker 1: Okay, so here's the deal.

120
00:07:00,894 --> 00:07:10,188
Speaker 1: when you go into the Tower of London Which is a legit fucking castle from like thousand years ago, but it's not a castle like the stereotypical Lego castle Yeah, it is.

121
00:07:10,489 --> 00:07:11,536
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't look like that.

122
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:14,166
Speaker 0: Yeah It looks more like a.

123
00:07:14,346 --> 00:07:17,859
Speaker 1: you know, it's got crenellated walls for archers.

124
00:07:19,322 --> 00:07:20,510
Speaker 1: It's a thousand years old.

125
00:07:20,752 --> 00:07:22,040
Speaker 1: What do you know about the Tower of London?

126
00:07:22,502 --> 00:07:22,824
Speaker 0: Pictures.

127
00:07:22,864 --> 00:07:24,471
Speaker 0: it doesn't look like a stereotypical castle.

128
00:07:24,813 --> 00:07:26,400
Speaker 1: Okay, what now?

129
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:35,270
Speaker 0: I'm curious what you think a stereotypical castle looks like because like all the domes and shit Towers domes on the top of the towers got.

130
00:07:35,311 --> 00:07:44,850
Speaker 1: domes are either way earlier or way Later than the area you're thinking about Typically not in castles but in palaces.

131
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:50,360
Speaker 1: and while some castles are also palaces most were not anyway.

132
00:07:51,344 --> 00:08:09,532
Speaker 1: So in the Tower of London the crown jewels are just there and you can just like go see him and they're just on this floor and there's this whole long build up where you walk by like pictures of them explaining which ones which and how most of them are from after the English Civil War because They all got destroyed in the English Civil War and they had to make new ones.

133
00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:27,718
Speaker 1: and then when you finally get to them there's just a sideways like Airport walking path like one of those like moving sidewalks to make sure you can't stand next to them too long and It just slowly takes you past them and you look at them as long as you can and then they force you to get the fuck Out of that room and that's the end

134
00:08:27,738 --> 00:08:27,880
Speaker 0: of it.

135
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,660
Speaker 0: Why don't you just make a little video so that you can then rewind the video and stop and look at them?

136
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,750
Speaker 1: You're not allowed to take pictures in there.

137
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,119
Speaker 1: Uh-huh at all.

138
00:08:35,662 --> 00:08:38,559
Speaker 1: Now the rationale is not for security or anything dumb like that.

139
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:45,420
Speaker 1: The rationale is simply the government of that country has plenty of great pictures at ultra high resolution.

140
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,022
Speaker 1: You can get.

141
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:51,920
Speaker 1: Oh and they don't want some shit ass tourists taking some shit ass picture and that being the picture that someone sees.

142
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,395
Speaker 0: Well, then if you want to see them why go there when I just look at the picture?

143
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:59,694
Speaker 1: because you can see him in person And it's actually like honestly, it's a jewel.

144
00:08:59,754 --> 00:09:05,407
Speaker 1: It's yeah, I thought you know The first time I went to see him when I was by myself years ago I just kind of went in like okay, whatever.

145
00:09:05,427 --> 00:09:09,726
Speaker 1: and then when I was actually in front of that big fucking diamond It was for a moment.

146
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:12,620
Speaker 1: It was like whoa, that's actually bigger than I expected.

147
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:18,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the Museum of Natural History in New York, which is not a disappointment and you should totally go there.

148
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,945
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, every museum in New York is great But that one's my favorite.

149
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:30,765
Speaker 0: but they had I don't know if it's still there cuz I haven't been there a long time But then the geology section they had the world's largest diamond Period yeah.

150
00:09:30,845 --> 00:09:37,191
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's also bigger than you expect And I saw it and it was a. it was big.

151
00:09:37,492 --> 00:09:40,200
Speaker 0: it was also a big disappointment cuz it was just a fucking rock.

152
00:09:40,401 --> 00:09:41,727
Speaker 0: Yeah, well this one.

153
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:45,465
Speaker 0: I'm not interested in seeing jewels in person So these are cut.

154
00:09:45,505 --> 00:09:49,420
Speaker 0: show me show me your jewel next to a banana in a photo for scale.

155
00:09:50,246 --> 00:09:52,160
Speaker 0: If you got bigger than the banana, then I'll come see.

156
00:09:54,442 --> 00:10:07,660
Speaker 1: But the other thing is I'd never ever like gone over to like see Westminster like any of the like touristy stuff and the one Thing that stands out from all of London that I don't know what to do about because it was like it was so unexpected.

157
00:10:08,021 --> 00:10:10,913
Speaker 1: Like, you know, there's like con games all over like go to Times Square.

158
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:12,680
Speaker 1: There's the guys give me rap CDs or whatever.

159
00:10:12,921 --> 00:10:15,349
Speaker 1: Yeah in London by Westminster.

160
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,096
Speaker 1: It's three card money.

161
00:10:17,356 --> 00:10:18,240
Speaker 1: It's the shell game.

162
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:19,624
Speaker 1: Yeah There is literally.

163
00:10:19,644 --> 00:10:30,620
Speaker 1: if you walk on the bridge that approaches Westminster every 15 feet There is a shell game with like the exact same four people to the point that it was like a glitch in the matrix.

164
00:10:30,803 --> 00:10:31,355
Speaker 0: Why don't you?

165
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:38,720
Speaker 1: Set up a shell game because I feel like all these other people running these clearly all run by the same illegal criminal organization.

166
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,790
Speaker 1: Shell game would have done something to me if I don't know.

167
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,580
Speaker 0: go like go like three blocks past the final shell game.

168
00:10:45,262 --> 00:10:51,744
Speaker 0: Ah, right and set up your shell game there and an area with slightly less traffic cuz clearly no one's no cops are stopping Anyone running a show?

169
00:10:51,764 --> 00:10:55,439
Speaker 0: Yeah and set up your completely fair American shell game.

170
00:10:56,203 --> 00:10:57,347
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the funniest thing.

171
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,773
Speaker 1: I watched a recent video.

172
00:10:58,793 --> 00:11:00,380
Speaker 1: It's not my thing of the day, but I'll just talk about it.

173
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,584
Speaker 1: I saw a good video of someone Demonstrating the shell game.

174
00:11:03,986 --> 00:11:04,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's laid a hand.

175
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,320
Speaker 1: No, no, no, but they did it for people.

176
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:08,565
Speaker 1: It was like close-up magic.

177
00:11:09,066 --> 00:11:12,660
Speaker 1: They used clear shells and the people still got fooled.

178
00:11:14,022 --> 00:11:15,311
Speaker 0: How could you get fooled with a clear shell?

179
00:11:15,493 --> 00:11:16,439
Speaker 1: It was very well done.

180
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:18,859
Speaker 0: You can see the ball right under there.

181
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,148
Speaker 1: You think that but then you are watching what happens.

182
00:11:21,268 --> 00:11:24,480
Speaker 0: if you use clear shells, I would basically like close my eyes.

183
00:11:24,831 --> 00:11:28,619
Speaker 0: No Wait till the end and you'd say which one and I would look at the three clear ones.

184
00:11:28,982 --> 00:11:30,456
Speaker 0: See which one had a fucking pee under yep.

185
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:36,476
Speaker 1: And as soon as that one and as soon as the shell that has that clearly has the pee under it is lifted It's not there.

186
00:11:37,401 --> 00:11:38,909
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm the one who should be lifting it.

187
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,800
Speaker 0: Not you get away from there cheatin, man.

188
00:11:41,161 --> 00:11:42,587
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, how do you think it'll go?

189
00:11:42,627 --> 00:11:45,620
Speaker 1: if I tell this like Russian looking mobster who's running this shell game?

190
00:11:45,921 --> 00:11:47,227
Speaker 1: Hey, I'm gonna pick up the shell.

191
00:11:48,252 --> 00:11:49,639
Speaker 1: I don't think that's gonna go over very well.

192
00:11:50,462 --> 00:11:56,280
Speaker 0: I should devise a shell game where you the person does all the touching and I still win.

193
00:11:56,962 --> 00:12:00,533
Speaker 1: Thing is I feel like you would make money just running the shell game.

194
00:12:00,574 --> 00:12:04,739
Speaker 0: legit because people are really bad The one out of three.

195
00:12:04,981 --> 00:12:09,480
Speaker 0: I feel like people would just mess up real fast so that they would get confused and not be able to track it.

196
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,403
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

197
00:12:10,504 --> 00:12:11,749
Speaker 0: I can't use any sleight of hand.

198
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:14,119
Speaker 0: Just move the shells real fast like whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

199
00:12:14,381 --> 00:12:15,318
Speaker 1: I feel like you'd still win.

200
00:12:16,943 --> 00:12:18,839
Speaker 1: So anyway, it's Monday when people do get it.

201
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,920
Speaker 0: I mean you go to a baseball game and on the jumbotron they always do the shell game with three baseball hats.

202
00:12:23,161 --> 00:12:26,880
Speaker 0: Yep, and it's always legit like they're not cheating because there's no prize at stake.

203
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:31,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just to keep you entertained in between innings and people do get it wrong.

204
00:12:32,863 --> 00:12:33,953
Speaker 1: So it's Monday, we're back.

205
00:12:34,014 --> 00:12:34,640
Speaker 1: It's geek nights.

206
00:12:35,781 --> 00:12:42,930
Speaker 1: I don't know if any of you are new and stumbled upon this but because I saw a bunch of people like Recently subscribed to my youtube like a whole bunch.

207
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:45,360
Speaker 1: I don't have someone linked to us, but this is geek nights.

208
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,776
Speaker 1: We're here and we're starting the show again like normal and it's Monday.

209
00:12:49,058 --> 00:12:51,839
Speaker 1: So on Wednesday We're gonna talk about the dragon prince because it's the animation day.

210
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:54,679
Speaker 1: So, uh, yeah, we got some news.

211
00:12:55,501 --> 00:12:57,473
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's too much tech news going down big.

212
00:12:57,533 --> 00:12:58,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I picked a right.

213
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,269
Speaker 0: I don't know how much even though they're big news is.

214
00:13:00,309 --> 00:13:02,100
Speaker 0: I don't know how much there is to say about these big news.

215
00:13:02,421 --> 00:13:05,130
Speaker 1: There's a few that while I would have a lot to say about it.

216
00:13:05,211 --> 00:13:07,840
Speaker 1: Most of what I have to say isn't really technology.

217
00:13:07,941 --> 00:13:10,800
Speaker 1: It's more like business related or like all there.

218
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:17,985
Speaker 1: It's related to things other than the technology itself and to I don't care a lot about a lot of these news Like the IBM the big one.

219
00:13:18,126 --> 00:13:22,920
Speaker 0: IBM fucking bought redhead with cash totally makes sense because they have the same customers.

220
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,603
Speaker 1: Yeah It does.

221
00:13:29,045 --> 00:13:30,349
Speaker 0: they're basically the same company.

222
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:36,506
Speaker 1: It also makes extra sense because remember IBM has been Ending their Unix line.

223
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:40,220
Speaker 1: So if IBM stuff like if you want to use IBM stuff, it's all Linux now.

224
00:13:40,661 --> 00:13:44,093
Speaker 1: So there isn't like IBM Unix like everyone's getting off all that now.

225
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:46,000
Speaker 0: It's not like you buy what it's not like you buy.

226
00:13:46,321 --> 00:13:51,059
Speaker 0: You know a big blue from IBM Who buys those now are anyway, someone must be buying them.

227
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:56,619
Speaker 0: But if you are the I got a lot of those but they're all legacy if you're a weird-ass company that buys one of those.

228
00:13:57,143 --> 00:13:59,179
Speaker 1: Do you know how many of those I've dealt with in my career?

229
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,825
Speaker 0: More than you worked at IBM.

230
00:14:01,926 --> 00:14:03,593
Speaker 1: I did work at IBM, but you know what.

231
00:14:03,794 --> 00:14:12,625
Speaker 1: when I worked at IBM The mainframes I dealt with are old to the point that IPL meant something to me That was different from a reboot.

232
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:19,945
Speaker 0: the point is if you if you're the kind of weird-ass company that buys an IBM server It's like I've been Windows.

233
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:25,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, but IBM is buying redhead for 34 billion dollars.

234
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,647
Speaker 0: I said that the number makes no sense to me.

235
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:32,985
Speaker 1: So that is a significant premium because right out was worth 20 billion dollars.

236
00:14:33,045 --> 00:14:34,489
Speaker 0: that number still makes no sense.

237
00:14:34,871 --> 00:14:37,960
Speaker 1: Well, I so that I realized this after we were talking before the show.

238
00:14:38,883 --> 00:14:40,449
Speaker 1: What do you think redhead does?

239
00:14:40,469 --> 00:14:43,080
Speaker 0: they just provide support and they manage a distro.

240
00:14:44,101 --> 00:14:51,338
Speaker 1: they provide a lot more services than that and a lot more tools than that and Not just support but also professional services.

241
00:14:51,861 --> 00:14:53,085
Speaker 1: They got all these cloud solutions.

242
00:14:53,406 --> 00:14:57,880
Speaker 1: redhead actually has a lot of stuff and they generate like three billion dollars in revenue a year.

243
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,120
Speaker 0: That's insane because as I was telling remember for the show like the New York Rangers are worth about a billion.

244
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:06,816
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was like who if I win that big lottery I could just buy the team.

245
00:15:06,937 --> 00:15:07,600
Speaker 0: Yeah be set.

246
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:08,586
Speaker 1: So you get rid of the.

247
00:15:08,626 --> 00:15:16,254
Speaker 0: she could fix the only thing wrong get so IBM Instead of buying the redhead could have bought almost every NHL team.

248
00:15:16,896 --> 00:15:17,096
Speaker 1: No.

249
00:15:17,437 --> 00:15:18,019
Speaker 0: Oh almost.

250
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:21,968
Speaker 0: Oh god Just buy every NHL team.

251
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,820
Speaker 1: billion for you billion for you billion for you.

252
00:15:25,964 --> 00:15:27,034
Speaker 0: That'd be a better idea.

253
00:15:28,601 --> 00:15:29,424
Speaker 1: Probably not.

254
00:15:29,585 --> 00:15:32,980
Speaker 1: so I don't want to like go too deep in like business.

255
00:15:34,026 --> 00:15:39,852
Speaker 0: Almost all the NHL teams then own IBM and redhead, I mean the crazy things about this are like.

256
00:15:39,893 --> 00:15:41,960
Speaker 1: apparently this is the biggest deal.

257
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:46,597
Speaker 0: Maybe that's stupid because if I apparently you said what red hat brings in how much a year three billion.

258
00:15:46,678 --> 00:15:48,826
Speaker 0: so I could just buy Red hat and every year buy three teams.

259
00:15:49,067 --> 00:15:51,337
Speaker 1: now, I don't know how much profit they make.

260
00:15:51,377 --> 00:15:52,120
Speaker 1: I didn't look that up.

261
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,972
Speaker 1: That's just revenue.

262
00:15:52,992 --> 00:15:56,318
Speaker 0: Oh But it can't cost too much to run.

263
00:15:57,462 --> 00:16:09,246
Speaker 0: So I imagine most people are just paying you for support and you're giving them almost no services Like a gym, this is the biggest thing and not coming IBM has ever done And it might looks like it.

264
00:16:09,287 --> 00:16:12,280
Speaker 1: according to this article at least it is the third for inflation as well.

265
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,143
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

266
00:16:13,203 --> 00:16:17,580
Speaker 1: This is the third biggest deal in the history of US technology.

267
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,231
Speaker 1: I can't believe it's so big.

268
00:16:19,634 --> 00:16:20,500
Speaker 1: the only ones that are bigger.

269
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,876
Speaker 1: I'm gonna quote this article from CNBC excluding the AOL Time Warner merger.

270
00:16:24,996 --> 00:16:25,197
Speaker 1: Yeah.

271
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:26,040
Speaker 0: Well, that's a merger.

272
00:16:26,742 --> 00:16:32,440
Speaker 1: The only larger deals ever were these 67 billion dollar merger between Dell and EMC.

273
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,147
Speaker 1: Okay, hold that thought.

274
00:16:37,167 --> 00:16:38,231
Speaker 0: I never heard EMC.

275
00:16:38,352 --> 00:16:41,926
Speaker 1: hold that thought because that gets back to a point I was gonna make earlier about you.

276
00:16:41,946 --> 00:16:52,920
Speaker 1: Okay, and JDS is uniphase or JDS Uniphase is four point one billion dollar acquisition of some optical component supplier Right before the dot-com bubble burst.

277
00:16:54,682 --> 00:16:56,267
Speaker 1: Neither do I because that was 2000.

278
00:16:56,267 --> 00:16:59,899
Speaker 0: people like optical parts where they like put laying all the dark fiber in the.

279
00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:03,407
Speaker 0: probably Basically, that makes sense that they would go out as best.

280
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:03,888
Speaker 1: I can tell.

281
00:17:03,968 --> 00:17:10,588
Speaker 1: that deal was literally like the deal happened and then seconds Later the dot-com bubble burst and everyone got fucked.

282
00:17:10,647 --> 00:17:18,493
Speaker 1: It makes it so part of the reason why I think the majority of the technology world is on the internet is really surprised by this.

283
00:17:18,634 --> 00:17:20,118
Speaker 1: and then a small number of us aren't.

284
00:17:20,138 --> 00:17:24,880
Speaker 1: and Is that your question of what is EMC and your questions about what a red hat does?

285
00:17:25,701 --> 00:17:37,140
Speaker 1: really shows the very very stark divide between the far majority of technology use cases and The enterprise use cases like the scale of enterprise technology.

286
00:17:37,321 --> 00:17:44,934
Speaker 0: I think enterprise as usual is just spending way too much money on a whole lot of nothing which But it's the scale of that money is bad.

287
00:17:44,995 --> 00:17:46,220
Speaker 1: So some of that is true.

288
00:17:46,420 --> 00:18:00,080
Speaker 1: I mean wait, I'm not gonna get into my whole like rant about why enterprise technology usually sucks ass But I've talked about that a lot on early gig nights because basically my entire career with one exception has been working with enterprise.

289
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:07,433
Speaker 0: Instead of paying red hat their portion of their three billion dollars of revenue You can hire like two nerds and just use free software.

290
00:18:08,156 --> 00:18:08,959
Speaker 1: it to a point.

291
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,275
Speaker 0: There's a certain what can red hat give you that I can't give you?

292
00:18:12,536 --> 00:18:19,040
Speaker 1: if you hire me I don't think you could provide the level of scaling technology that I need.

293
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:21,340
Speaker 0: I just I would you just give me the power to hire more me's.

294
00:18:22,562 --> 00:18:39,079
Speaker 1: It doesn't really scale well or that leads to weird like spaghetti Report to lines and poorly documented solutions across a lot of disparate hardware over time anyway, this also it sort of makes sense based on what IBM does and what red hat does.

295
00:18:39,099 --> 00:18:56,720
Speaker 1: and The best way I can describe this for like people who aren't in enterprise world is that it probably means IBM is gonna really try to push into like private and semi-private Cloud solutions for companies that aren't gonna just trust Amazon with their data.

296
00:18:57,182 --> 00:19:02,463
Speaker 0: yeah, I guess you know you'll have another choice right instead of Google or Amazon or Microsoft like.

297
00:19:02,483 --> 00:19:03,045
Speaker 1: here's the difference.

298
00:19:03,367 --> 00:19:06,560
Speaker 0: IBM slash red hat will now become an actual choice.

299
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:15,157
Speaker 1: Small medium-sized and even the lower end of large companies can still like just put their stuff on but cloud technologies Solutions and just go with it.

300
00:19:15,661 --> 00:19:36,040
Speaker 1: But there's a scale above that where either because of the data because of laws because the scale There's a lot of reasons why some of these extremely big companies or companies that do extremely proprietary things basically need to run their own cloud and provide it as a Software solution or hardware solution to the rest of their own company.

301
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,585
Speaker 0: I mean you don't need to.

302
00:19:37,645 --> 00:19:42,540
Speaker 0: there are ridiculously big companies that run on Google Microsoft Amazon true.

303
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:51,952
Speaker 0: But I'm sure those companies even though they do that and even though it may work some of them may be Unhappy giving their competitor a giant pile of money every month.

304
00:19:52,113 --> 00:19:55,888
Speaker 0: Yep, or running it themselves They would save a ton of money or

305
00:19:55,908 --> 00:20:11,618
Speaker 1: there might be issues like Amazon's got a lot of great solutions But for certain kinds of connectivity or certain kinds of things you might want to solve There SLA is actually like unusable Like you can't really do real-time stock trading from AWS.

306
00:20:12,523 --> 00:20:13,911
Speaker 0: No, probably not like.

307
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,480
Speaker 1: there's a lot of things you need to do differently.

308
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:29,320
Speaker 1: so I guess the meta point of all this is that this deal does make sense if you Have a broad view of the technology sector, but it does not make sense to the vast majority of technologists.

309
00:20:30,924 --> 00:20:35,087
Speaker 1: so in some other news Twitter let's talk about the Apple stuffers.

310
00:20:35,128 --> 00:20:35,689
Speaker 1: That's more fun.

311
00:20:36,031 --> 00:20:37,415
Speaker 0: Absolutely Apple is so.

312
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:41,550
Speaker 0: usually Apple Announcements are not surprises because they're like.

313
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:42,996
Speaker 0: people are always like, oh my god Apple.

314
00:20:43,036 --> 00:20:44,200
Speaker 0: It's like are you not paying attention?

315
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,223
Speaker 0: They release that.

316
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:49,360
Speaker 0: they make the same announcements at the same time every year on a clock like calendar, right?

317
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:55,140
Speaker 0: September is always back-to-school iPods which became back-to-school iPhones every year for the past many many years.

318
00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:00,980
Speaker 0: But they're going off schedule in October, which is like real November like real soon.

319
00:21:01,482 --> 00:21:02,144
Speaker 0: They're going.

320
00:21:02,165 --> 00:21:03,992
Speaker 0: I think it's this week maybe right?

321
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:04,876
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's coming out.

322
00:21:05,057 --> 00:21:05,860
Speaker 0: It's in Brooklyn.

323
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,767
Speaker 0: I don't know why the fucking right.

324
00:21:07,787 --> 00:21:11,640
Speaker 1: the Brooklyn Academy of Music on October 26 of those few days ago.

325
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,725
Speaker 0: It must be music related.

326
00:21:12,826 --> 00:21:14,353
Speaker 1: Oh, they put the signs up.

327
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:15,740
Speaker 1: They put all this Apple stuff there.

328
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,892
Speaker 0: Yeah, it definitely must be related to iTunes music Apple music.

329
00:21:20,032 --> 00:21:21,657
Speaker 0: Yeah, if they're going there, right?

330
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,720
Speaker 0: They're definitely telling you something.

331
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,504
Speaker 0: Well, it's tomorrow.

332
00:21:23,826 --> 00:21:24,007
Speaker 0: Yeah.

333
00:21:24,128 --> 00:21:24,430
Speaker 0: Okay.

334
00:21:24,711 --> 00:21:28,506
Speaker 0: There's gonna be announcements Relating to iPads.

335
00:21:28,647 --> 00:21:32,000
Speaker 0: mostly people are hoping maybe some beats action music.

336
00:21:32,201 --> 00:21:33,104
Speaker 0: Right, maybe some.

337
00:21:33,144 --> 00:21:36,194
Speaker 1: the rumor is specifically new round of iPads.

338
00:21:36,275 --> 00:21:43,530
Speaker 0: I heard all using USB C Apple TV, maybe all those sorts of things.

339
00:21:43,631 --> 00:21:45,318
Speaker 1: Yeah, I feel because it can't be phone stuff.

340
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:45,920
Speaker 1: They already did phone.

341
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,484
Speaker 0: So phones are in September.

342
00:21:47,565 --> 00:21:52,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've never seen an Apple thing in October November, but there's no way.

343
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,668
Speaker 1: It's like desktop II stuff.

344
00:21:54,769 --> 00:21:57,200
Speaker 0: No that stuff is always done if they do it.

345
00:21:57,503 --> 00:21:59,945
Speaker 0: They used to go to CES But now they tend to.

346
00:22:00,005 --> 00:22:10,720
Speaker 0: I think they like make an announcement sort of close to CES or maybe in March And then they have their WWDC which is where they announce all their software updates because that's for developers.

347
00:22:11,141 --> 00:22:16,740
Speaker 1: So apparently the theme of the event is the word making so it's probably around using.

348
00:22:17,001 --> 00:22:32,171
Speaker 0: They're probably gonna also be announcing like, you know, if I get an I work updates again and probably like Creative software that works well on iPads ways to integrate iPad Pros getting updated, right?

349
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:33,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what that's what the making is.

350
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:42,672
Speaker 1: I wonder if they're gonna try to provide software and like I don't know whatever cables you need to integrate iPad pros into like Actual media production pipeline.

351
00:22:42,692 --> 00:22:45,326
Speaker 1: I mean they already do that Yeah, but they're not like.

352
00:22:45,587 --> 00:22:46,792
Speaker 1: that's not really like.

353
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,640
Speaker 1: most production pipelines don't involve an iPad.

354
00:22:49,363 --> 00:22:50,990
Speaker 0: I see a lot of people use iPads for a lot of things.

355
00:22:51,171 --> 00:22:53,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, but not not the kind of stuff I'm talking about.

356
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:58,010
Speaker 1: iPad Pro will be the most significant in the products history apparently.

357
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:58,491
Speaker 0: Hmm.

358
00:22:58,952 --> 00:23:01,800
Speaker 0: So yeah, we'll see my iPad Pro is still just fine.

359
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,755
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna replace it cuz it's so expensive.

360
00:23:04,138 --> 00:23:04,340
Speaker 1: though.

361
00:23:04,641 --> 00:23:13,458
Speaker 1: If it's true that they're moving until it's really dead if it's true that they're moving to USB C then that leaves the iPhone as the sole device on earth that uses lightning.

362
00:23:13,538 --> 00:23:15,545
Speaker 0: I guess Yeah, well, I mean they.

363
00:23:15,786 --> 00:23:19,463
Speaker 0: they made everyone go like lightning headphones and shit, yeah I don't think.

364
00:23:19,504 --> 00:23:22,620
Speaker 0: I think what it is is I don't think they're actually replacing the lightning part.

365
00:23:23,142 --> 00:23:26,698
Speaker 0: I think it's still gonna be lightning on one end and it's USB C on the other end.

366
00:23:28,042 --> 00:23:29,416
Speaker 0: Right because right now it's like you.

367
00:23:29,577 --> 00:23:31,888
Speaker 0: you know It's regular use.

368
00:23:31,908 --> 00:23:33,501
Speaker 1: that doesn't really make a lot of sense though Cuz.

369
00:23:33,522 --> 00:23:35,480
Speaker 1: then what are you gonna plug that into to charge?

370
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:39,349
Speaker 0: You're gonna need a regular Mac which has only USB C's on the side of it.

371
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:42,217
Speaker 1: What if you only have an iPad Pro?

372
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,786
Speaker 1: I Have your charging brick.

373
00:23:45,088 --> 00:23:46,174
Speaker 0: this it comes with a thing.

374
00:23:46,214 --> 00:23:46,395
Speaker 0: Yeah.

375
00:23:46,817 --> 00:23:50,471
Speaker 1: Yeah Let's see faster processors.

376
00:23:50,913 --> 00:23:52,059
Speaker 1: Oh LED screen on the.

377
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:57,995
Speaker 0: Didn't make iPad Pro with an LED screen that will cut and it's as big as this one 13 inch.

378
00:23:58,336 --> 00:23:59,981
Speaker 0: that will cost like $2,000.

379
00:23:59,981 --> 00:24:01,485
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is the rumors.

380
00:24:01,505 --> 00:24:03,350
Speaker 1: This is the rumors that I found on this website.

381
00:24:03,611 --> 00:24:06,740
Speaker 1: Maybe even 2500 smaller bezels USB C.

382
00:24:08,441 --> 00:24:13,379
Speaker 0: Oh LED screens are the best screens if you don't know that at least available to consumers right now.

383
00:24:14,142 --> 00:24:26,094
Speaker 0: the problem with the LED screens is that when they try to make them a lot of them just don't fucking work and like they'll Have a dead pixel in them or something and they basically it's like they try to make ten screens like one of them is any Good and that's why they cost an arm and a leg.

384
00:24:26,114 --> 00:24:29,796
Speaker 1: Oh Face ID will enable animojis.

385
00:24:29,816 --> 00:24:33,850
Speaker 1: Yep, probably Screens, nope, the screens will be less expensive.

386
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,633
Speaker 1: LCD panels.

387
00:24:34,694 --> 00:24:35,396
Speaker 1: No LED.

388
00:24:35,638 --> 00:24:47,225
Speaker 1: Okay Rumor, I mean, it's usually the rumors are on but yeah, let's see a complete redesign of the look more squared off sides faster processor Custom Apple graphics chip.

389
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:51,798
Speaker 1: apparently Apple every iPad has a custom and an updated Apple pencil.

390
00:24:52,419 --> 00:24:54,286
Speaker 1: Okay All right.

391
00:24:54,306 --> 00:24:56,019
Speaker 1: I can't say that I care that much.

392
00:24:57,123 --> 00:24:59,931
Speaker 1: I'm gonna continue to use my 2009 Lenovo laptop.

393
00:24:59,951 --> 00:25:03,683
Speaker 0: You did my use my first gen iPad Pro until it is Unusable.

394
00:25:03,864 --> 00:25:12,240
Speaker 0: Yep, and then so my problem is oh, I'm gonna survive at least Hopefully one hopefully more than one more generation of iPad Pro.

395
00:25:12,401 --> 00:25:21,236
Speaker 0: So I guess if they're gonna start doing these in October, I may be October 2020 Maybe yeah, so everyone's freaking out cuz Twitter said they're gonna remove the like button.

396
00:25:21,476 --> 00:25:22,560
Speaker 0: They're not actually gonna remove.

397
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,368
Speaker 0: Well, they just suggested they might.

398
00:25:24,508 --> 00:25:28,564
Speaker 1: so they said they might but it looks like in a clarifying statement They probably will.

399
00:25:28,604 --> 00:25:33,220
Speaker 0: just first of all everyone is so mad when they changed it from the the save to be like button.

400
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, and now they're mad that they're gonna remove the like button.

401
00:25:35,861 --> 00:25:37,640
Speaker 0: It's like you got mad about its old.

402
00:25:38,042 --> 00:25:41,196
Speaker 1: So the problem was like whatever that was.

403
00:25:41,336 --> 00:25:42,100
Speaker 1: it served a purpose.

404
00:25:42,381 --> 00:25:45,671
Speaker 1: But then they turned it into like a light version of retweet.

405
00:25:45,691 --> 00:25:48,359
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, which was a just a terrible UX decision.

406
00:25:48,379 --> 00:26:01,534
Speaker 1: and The real story here is just that Twitter Continues to be beholden to its shareholders to make money yet There is literally no way to monetize this platform in a way that will satisfy them.

407
00:26:01,896 --> 00:26:14,980
Speaker 1: and they're gonna play this game Until eventually Twitter collapses and there's like there is no chance this company will ever make a good UX decision again Until their stock collapses to the point that all the shareholders give up and maybe someone more intelligent takes over.

408
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:20,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, I looked into Some of the you know non-major.

409
00:26:21,281 --> 00:26:22,345
Speaker 1: So they're all awful.

410
00:26:22,526 --> 00:26:26,640
Speaker 1: half of them are free speech extremists like gab which is literally just Nazis.

411
00:26:26,882 --> 00:26:27,840
Speaker 0: Well, no, not that one.

412
00:26:29,643 --> 00:26:32,819
Speaker 1: All the free speech ones are just Nazis and child porn all the way down.

413
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:39,340
Speaker 0: So all the the some of the ones that seem to be good like in terms of good people are really bad software.

414
00:26:39,561 --> 00:26:41,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, and there was one that had a really nice design.

415
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:46,298
Speaker 0: It reminded me of like a sort of like an or cut that was made in the modern times of mastodon.

416
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:51,540
Speaker 0: No You know, but it seemed okay, but then note the free speech extremist.

417
00:26:51,681 --> 00:26:53,779
Speaker 0: I didn't actually see too many Nazis on it.

418
00:26:54,121 --> 00:27:05,243
Speaker 0: But I basically, you know the I was like, oh there's no one to follow on this thing, obviously Yeah I followed the founders of it to see what kind of people they were and like the first post that he made was like Yeah, I made.

419
00:27:05,283 --> 00:27:16,900
Speaker 0: we made this so that we could you know for all the people who got kicked off of other platform No, I'm like no delete delete account cuz the further rally is all those other platforms are really hesitant to kick anyone off.

420
00:27:17,181 --> 00:27:20,657
Speaker 1: So the people who are actually kicked off are the worst human beings on earth.

421
00:27:21,018 --> 00:27:28,140
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I mean look at the people who are on gab Terrorists and now gab is shut down because they got to monetize and be platformed again, thankfully.

422
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:39,280
Speaker 1: So I suspect Twitter is gonna do something really stupid with the like button and what's really crazy Is that the rationale that they give is that they want to?

423
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:47,110
Speaker 1: Increase the quality of debate by forcing people to engage Which is the literal opposite of what any human wants from this platform.

424
00:27:47,492 --> 00:27:48,234
Speaker 0: I want to debate.

425
00:27:48,414 --> 00:27:53,632
Speaker 0: I want to share pictures Of cute dogs, I wanted to just be a platform.

426
00:27:53,652 --> 00:27:55,620
Speaker 0: tweet out when there's a new geek nights episode.

427
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:58,860
Speaker 0: Yep, all the tweets when there's a new Nvidia driver.

428
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,099
Speaker 1: Literally, the only good thing that the Twitter has ever provided is a chat room that me and all my friends are in.

429
00:28:04,139 --> 00:28:07,009
Speaker 1: but I can Also follow strangers if I want to but I don't have to.

430
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:09,980
Speaker 0: I can get a notification when like this pack tickets for sale.

431
00:28:10,181 --> 00:28:13,654
Speaker 1: Yep, I tried to use mastodon, but there's no one really on there.

432
00:28:13,815 --> 00:28:14,557
Speaker 0: Also, it sucks.

433
00:28:14,698 --> 00:28:16,428
Speaker 1: Yeah, it sucks But also there's no one on there.

434
00:28:16,509 --> 00:28:18,039
Speaker 1: So I just like I'd look at it.

435
00:28:18,381 --> 00:28:21,636
Speaker 1: No one posted anything that I care about and I have to cross post.

436
00:28:21,656 --> 00:28:22,540
Speaker 1: I'm not willing to do that.

437
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,051
Speaker 0: I came up with an idea of how to get people to.

438
00:28:26,092 --> 00:28:28,620
Speaker 0: it's like anything you start is gonna start small.

439
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,986
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's no way to start it big.

440
00:28:30,247 --> 00:28:33,320
Speaker 0: How do you get people to use a thing when it's small?

441
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:36,829
Speaker 1: You got to get a single community to jump ship.

442
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,152
Speaker 0: No, I had an idea.

443
00:28:38,312 --> 00:28:38,673
Speaker 0: All right.

444
00:28:38,713 --> 00:28:39,315
Speaker 1: I'm curious.

445
00:28:39,696 --> 00:28:40,578
Speaker 0: I'm not telling you the idea.

446
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:45,855
Speaker 1: Oh Okay, you can just do the idea maybe or you just got Other ideas.

447
00:28:47,964 --> 00:28:49,453
Speaker 0: Because I got a lot of ideas I got.

448
00:28:49,493 --> 00:28:50,117
Speaker 0: you have any ideas?

449
00:28:50,218 --> 00:28:53,005
Speaker 0: I got The hopper Scott Hopper.

450
00:28:53,025 --> 00:28:55,092
Speaker 0: Jerry Scott smacks top of his brain.

451
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:55,734
Speaker 0: Oh, I got.

452
00:28:55,915 --> 00:28:57,360
Speaker 0: I can fit so many ideas in this.

453
00:28:57,821 --> 00:28:58,945
Speaker 0: It's going in the hopper Jerry.

454
00:28:59,186 --> 00:28:59,929
Speaker 0: You know my ideas.

455
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:00,952
Speaker 0: I can fit in this skull.

456
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:03,603
Speaker 0: Oh Baby.

457
00:29:04,329 --> 00:29:07,780
Speaker 1: so last and least There's an article here on motherboard.

458
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:13,196
Speaker 1: I just want to kind of point you people add because Bitcoin is shitty and serves no purpose in modern society.

459
00:29:13,216 --> 00:29:14,440
Speaker 0: all coins bullshit.

460
00:29:14,883 --> 00:29:22,480
Speaker 1: but it is also a Direct contributor to global warming due to the sheer amount of energy it wastes on a hourly basis.

461
00:29:22,663 --> 00:29:23,480
Speaker 0: We are well aware.

462
00:29:23,843 --> 00:29:32,660
Speaker 1: So if you need more evidence old news This is at least a year old to tell your idiot friends who think that bitcoins are in any way a benefit to society.

463
00:29:32,961 --> 00:29:44,290
Speaker 1: here is yet another article you can throw at them and now it's time for things of the day.

464
00:29:44,612 --> 00:29:54,810
Speaker 1: so a long time ago like 2006 I talked about this on gig nights because I learned about it and I did it and it worked and it was awesome But kind of forgot about it till recently.

465
00:29:55,233 --> 00:30:14,190
Speaker 1: But if you work if you live in an apartment building Like in a city or you work in a company where there are doors that have keys Usually you'll have a key that opens your door and someone else in the company will have a key that opens many doors And there's usually someone who has a key that will open any door.

466
00:30:14,571 --> 00:30:20,350
Speaker 0: Well, usually at least at least what I've seen in New York is there isn't usually a key that opens.

467
00:30:20,591 --> 00:30:23,302
Speaker 1: I think I can open your apartment building and get in like with a key.

468
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:32,050
Speaker 0: I can buy an Amazon stuff probably Yeah But there is usually a janitor or super or someone who just has a fuck ton of keys one for every buck.

469
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,169
Speaker 0: That's actually to remember which one goes with it.

470
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:41,990
Speaker 1: That's actually pretty rare because the the master key or like delegated key systems are really really common.

471
00:30:42,532 --> 00:30:44,943
Speaker 1: You can buy a system where you can literally like.

472
00:30:45,144 --> 00:30:46,390
Speaker 1: there's multiple keys.

473
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:52,374
Speaker 1: Like though you can have a key that only works on this floor and a key that only works on this door on this floor And I can't.

474
00:30:52,394 --> 00:30:52,998
Speaker 0: that's modern.

475
00:30:53,179 --> 00:30:58,501
Speaker 1: I'll talk about these new buildings That's modern from like the late 1800s.

476
00:30:58,541 --> 00:30:59,164
Speaker 1: Like that's not.

477
00:30:59,605 --> 00:31:00,569
Speaker 1: that's not that new.

478
00:31:01,011 --> 00:31:02,117
Speaker 0: Well, then why do you buy it?

479
00:31:02,217 --> 00:31:04,490
Speaker 0: even when I was a kid people's blood is laying keys.

480
00:31:05,085 --> 00:31:22,378
Speaker 1: uh so the problem with almost every implementation of this system old or new is that from any one key You can derive the master key and you don't even need to use any other Doors in the building to test this.

481
00:31:22,739 --> 00:31:33,285
Speaker 1: you can use your own door like in your own office with your own key That's only keyed for your door and with a little bit of filing and fucking around You can derive the actual master key to the entire building.

482
00:31:33,306 --> 00:31:37,584
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm And I did it once in a building and it worked.

483
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,432
Speaker 1: this was in like 2006.

484
00:31:39,432 --> 00:31:46,945
Speaker 1: Here's a video that explains in like really easy digest detail Exactly how to do it with animations about why it works.

485
00:31:47,508 --> 00:31:47,629
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

486
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:52,504
Speaker 1: So I'm not saying I encourage you to try this but it will totally work.

487
00:31:53,146 --> 00:32:04,325
Speaker 0: But yeah if you live Somewhere that you know like an apartment building where the super has a key to your apartment Try to add like a second lock that has a key from a locksmith that only you have.

488
00:32:04,446 --> 00:32:10,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually the Additional lock that is not part of any sort of key system.

489
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:15,675
Speaker 1: Our super can open our door because once I like myself out so it's nice to be able to get like Get back in.

490
00:32:15,756 --> 00:32:20,337
Speaker 0: but also if say you rent office space Don't just use the locks to come with it.

491
00:32:20,477 --> 00:32:24,350
Speaker 0: add your own, you know, get some like RFID lock extra thing on there.

492
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:31,096
Speaker 1: Yep Oh as a bonus control as a bonus decide it usually doesn't matter because you can usually just slip the latch You don't even need to do the key thing.

493
00:32:31,277 --> 00:32:33,548
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, also make sure your latch can't be.

494
00:32:34,151 --> 00:32:39,112
Speaker 1: Do you know how to tell if you keep your latch can be on D last year usually people put those like big metal plates Over them.

495
00:32:39,394 --> 00:32:40,782
Speaker 1: those don't stop anyone.

496
00:32:40,862 --> 00:32:45,302
Speaker 0: Obviously, you can pry off the metal Piece of metal wire.

497
00:32:45,343 --> 00:32:49,878
Speaker 1: you're good You can slip in locks is so easy.

498
00:32:49,998 --> 00:32:57,682
Speaker 1: It's so, you know, this is a total aside, you know when you close the door There's like the latch and then there's that little piece of metal sticking out behind the latch.

499
00:32:58,224 --> 00:32:58,385
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

500
00:32:58,786 --> 00:33:00,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know that that moves independently.

501
00:33:00,251 --> 00:33:02,029
Speaker 1: Yeah, do you know what that little piece of metal does?

502
00:33:04,711 --> 00:33:07,001
Speaker 0: No, I feel like I could figure it out if I just stood next.

503
00:33:07,101 --> 00:33:14,469
Speaker 1: it prevents latch slipping But only if the plate that the latch goes into is shaped the right way.

504
00:33:15,651 --> 00:33:21,599
Speaker 1: And most doors it is not shaped the right way because even people who install doors Don't know what that little piece of metal.

505
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,651
Speaker 0: Usually you hopefully you have like a bolt Bolts.

506
00:33:24,892 --> 00:33:27,740
Speaker 1: the latch bolts are just as easily slipped.

507
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,204
Speaker 0: I mean look hinges.

508
00:33:29,224 --> 00:33:30,488
Speaker 0: you could just bust the door down.

509
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:38,245
Speaker 1: Oh, no actually, there are a Hinges where even if they're on the outside, there's literally no way to open the door.

510
00:33:38,366 --> 00:33:41,393
Speaker 1: Even if you just remove the pins He's knocked the door.

511
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:42,738
Speaker 0: You could destroy the door.

512
00:33:42,778 --> 00:33:45,107
Speaker 1: Yes, you could battery ram the door down.

513
00:33:45,147 --> 00:33:45,950
Speaker 1: that will always work.

514
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:51,029
Speaker 1: Yes, except on the crown jewels because that door is like 12 inches thick get a bigger ram.

515
00:33:52,651 --> 00:33:56,081
Speaker 0: Anyway, so you're talking about the shell game, right?

516
00:33:56,422 --> 00:34:05,463
Speaker 0: So in the in if you go to some arcades these days They're mostly full of crane games and other bullshit like that And one of the things I've seen in arcades for maybe 10 years or so.

517
00:34:05,483 --> 00:34:10,099
Speaker 0: ish is the the What's it called dealer no-deal game?

518
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,795
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's basically just a ticket game You know, it's luck-based.

519
00:34:13,815 --> 00:34:16,969
Speaker 0: you choose suitcases trying to open the ones that have the money in them or whatever.

520
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,509
Speaker 0: I don't know exactly how it works, right?

521
00:34:18,992 --> 00:34:22,188
Speaker 0: But it's you know, it's based on the dealer no-deal game show you see on TV.

522
00:34:22,583 --> 00:34:29,429
Speaker 0: Yeah And some enterprising kids the arcade have figured out a way to completely scam this game to get the maximum prize every single time.

523
00:34:31,132 --> 00:34:40,989
Speaker 0: Now at first I thought whoa they hacked that game Wow, but then no I realized They're just using stupid kid logic and the people who made the game were even stupider.

524
00:34:41,952 --> 00:34:51,509
Speaker 0: The way the game works is it shows you all these suitcases and opens all of them Yeah, and shows you how much money is each one and there's a lot of them not three Yep, and it shuffles them up like a shell game.

525
00:34:52,411 --> 00:35:00,870
Speaker 0: Right, but it shuffles them up on a digital screen and there's no way you could possibly follow them because they're like 100% you know, what's funny is I would assume that that would just be an animation.

526
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,438
Speaker 1: It was the same no matter what right.

527
00:35:02,518 --> 00:35:03,885
Speaker 0: and then so what these kids did?

528
00:35:04,006 --> 00:35:16,369
Speaker 0: using their phones They record a video of the shuffling and then they play it back in slow-mo and skip around and you know Shuffle back and forth and figure out which suitcases move to which position.

529
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:20,730
Speaker 0: now The question is why does the animation of the suitcases match?

530
00:35:21,872 --> 00:35:23,670
Speaker 0: Like what the values that are in them?

531
00:35:24,892 --> 00:35:27,580
Speaker 1: If I wrote the soft I would have easily played a video.

532
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,590
Speaker 0: that's the same literally every time I wrote the software for that game.

533
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:40,921
Speaker 0: I would just have a video of suitcases shuffling and then use a random number generator to fill this to populate the splats and Then you wouldn't be able to follow which one had all the value.

534
00:35:41,001 --> 00:35:42,947
Speaker 0: but no these kids totally worked.

535
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:47,179
Speaker 0: the animation Matches the values in the suitcases and these kids.

536
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:47,821
Speaker 0: it's awesome.

537
00:35:48,022 --> 00:35:50,990
Speaker 1: So when I was a kid, we did something similar.

538
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:54,630
Speaker 0: It's at all its tickets and they got the best prizes.

539
00:35:54,791 --> 00:36:00,794
Speaker 1: We basically figured out a way to hack this one game and get it to spit out every ticket it had With a quarter.

540
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:04,810
Speaker 0: the one we did is the one where the you put the quarter in the slot.

541
00:36:04,951 --> 00:36:06,701
Speaker 0: Oh, it rolls down on that conveyor belt.

542
00:36:06,821 --> 00:36:08,310
Speaker 0: It rolls on a conveyor belt.

543
00:36:08,551 --> 00:36:08,873
Speaker 1: That was the

544
00:36:09,014 --> 00:36:13,820
Speaker 0: one and what we would do is we would just put Tokens in until we got the highest score

545
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,030
Speaker 1: and then we still need to stick gum or tape in the side

546
00:36:17,031 --> 00:36:31,770
Speaker 0: Electrical tape or something to lock that Into that position because they didn't have any sort of randomness or you know Anything like say that the coin pusher or the the ball rolling it was so it was just the same thing.

547
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:36,348
Speaker 0: It was so uniform and I you know, you don't see that in arcades a lot these days.

548
00:36:36,629 --> 00:36:40,970
Speaker 1: Yep So yeah, the problem was like my friends all did it and I was like, oh that's clever.

549
00:36:41,392 --> 00:36:44,450
Speaker 1: But then I did a little bit of math based on the prizes available.

550
00:36:45,293 --> 00:36:55,589
Speaker 1: Even winning the maximum prize on every quarter You could get that TV by spending like three hundred dollars and that TV that you could win The met grand prize was worth like eighty dollars.

551
00:36:57,651 --> 00:37:00,866
Speaker 1: Also cold guy points out here, you know why they did it?

552
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:01,509
Speaker 1: the way they did it?

553
00:37:02,092 --> 00:37:05,010
Speaker 1: Because it has to technically be a game of skill per gambling laws.

554
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:12,150
Speaker 1: It might be one of those things where it may be one jurisdiction they sold the game.

555
00:37:15,431 --> 00:37:22,370
Speaker 1: Also because I'll bet the maximum payouts translate into profit for the arcade regardless, I'm sure they do.

556
00:37:22,915 --> 00:37:24,009
Speaker 1: That's the real answer.

557
00:37:25,051 --> 00:37:34,390
Speaker 0: But I'm sure these kids saw some prize that they wanted to get with those tickets and they those kids have a bunch of arcade Tokens and they have a bunch of fun time messing with this machine.

558
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:37,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they don't have enough money to just go buy that thing.

559
00:37:37,511 --> 00:37:40,789
Speaker 1: It only works if you have a scan to get free arcade tokens.

560
00:37:42,151 --> 00:37:45,930
Speaker 1: That's how you launder arcade tokens into shitty TVs and game gears.

561
00:37:47,711 --> 00:37:50,826
Speaker 1: When I was a kid the major magics, there's a game gear you could get for 10,000 tickets.

562
00:37:51,851 --> 00:37:53,899
Speaker 0: You can just buy a game gear for less than the cost of 10,000.

563
00:37:53,899 --> 00:37:55,726
Speaker 1: Yeah, we I ended up.

564
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:56,590
Speaker 1: we bought a game gear.

565
00:37:56,731 --> 00:38:00,635
Speaker 0: It was so quick math because when I was a kid It was 25 cents a token.

566
00:38:00,675 --> 00:38:03,424
Speaker 0: you could end up and if you won the game, it was 25 cents for 200 tickets, right?

567
00:38:05,793 --> 00:38:13,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you said 10,000 tickets for the game 10,000 gigs for the game gear if I recall correctly divided by 200, that'd be you need to play 50 tokens.

568
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,020
Speaker 0: That's 50 times dot.

569
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:18,415
Speaker 0: 25 cents 1250 for a game gear.

570
00:38:18,495 --> 00:38:19,741
Speaker 0: No, that can't be your.

571
00:38:19,761 --> 00:38:21,690
Speaker 0: your arcade must had lower pay else than mine.

572
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:26,294
Speaker 0: The major magics didn't have the conveyor belt game I mean But you probably had nothing.

573
00:38:26,314 --> 00:38:28,481
Speaker 0: that was paying out 200 on the single token.

574
00:38:28,521 --> 00:38:31,430
Speaker 1: the conveyor belt game was at the arcade in the mall.

575
00:38:31,891 --> 00:38:37,750
Speaker 1: The Oh God what the poor was that place called the reason it was notable because that arcade had a water slide in it.

576
00:38:38,752 --> 00:38:40,178
Speaker 1: There was a water slide in the mall.

577
00:38:40,198 --> 00:38:41,925
Speaker 1: Okay, that went through the arcade.

578
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:42,407
Speaker 1: Okay.

579
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:43,010
Speaker 1: I was a kid.

580
00:38:43,174 --> 00:38:44,721
Speaker 1: All right I was wanted to ride it.

581
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:51,409
Speaker 1: when I was a little kid I kind of assumed the water slide drowned everyone and it was a trap because I never saw anyone ever get out of it.

582
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:52,778
Speaker 1: But that's cuz.

583
00:38:52,798 --> 00:38:54,250
Speaker 1: getting out of it was like this hidden area.

584
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:58,366
Speaker 1: Anyway, the tubes like went around the mall and then ended in the arcade like in the.

585
00:38:58,406 --> 00:38:59,550
Speaker 0: bring a bathing suit to the mall.

586
00:38:59,891 --> 00:39:01,378
Speaker 0: Yeah, it wasn't just a slide slide.

587
00:39:01,398 --> 00:39:02,342
Speaker 0: It was a one-side ball.

588
00:39:02,362 --> 00:39:04,290
Speaker 1: There's a water fucking slide in lakeside mall.

589
00:39:04,431 --> 00:39:08,293
Speaker 0: I'm gonna bring your bathing suit to the mall to go in there Mm-hmm.

590
00:39:08,935 --> 00:39:10,239
Speaker 1: I'm gonna try to find a picture of it.

591
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:22,810
Speaker 1: There it is the fucking water slide in lakeside mall And then it ended in the arcade anyway, okay Wow, that picture actually brings a ridiculous amount of nostalgia into my life.

592
00:39:23,071 --> 00:39:31,830
Speaker 0: okay, so in the meta moment the book club book is a 2001 a Space Odyssey, which I didn't read but I read instead many fans.

593
00:39:32,012 --> 00:39:37,024
Speaker 0: I Could have read 2001 several times over in the time.

594
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:38,790
Speaker 0: It took me to read those fantasy novels on the beach.

595
00:39:39,031 --> 00:39:40,314
Speaker 0: I also didn't read it by a nerd.

596
00:39:40,374 --> 00:39:44,085
Speaker 1: I am I just played slay the spire for like two weeks.

597
00:39:44,265 --> 00:39:44,706
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

598
00:39:44,847 --> 00:39:45,148
Speaker 0: Yeah.

599
00:39:45,348 --> 00:39:47,252
Speaker 1: Yeah All right.

600
00:39:47,332 --> 00:39:52,687
Speaker 1: Otherwise, we are going to be live at PAX unplugged kind of soon.

601
00:39:52,707 --> 00:39:56,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's in Shitty, Pennsylvania, but it's a pack.

602
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,384
Speaker 1: So real packs.

603
00:39:57,565 --> 00:40:01,540
Speaker 1: We're doing the 40 tabletop games Break even but we're gonna be a little more.

604
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:04,110
Speaker 1: we're gonna assume the audience knows tabletops.

605
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:10,210
Speaker 1: We're gonna go a little deeper there and we're doing a learn and win brand-new Puerto Rico for two hours on Saturday.

606
00:40:10,334 --> 00:40:10,705
Speaker 0: Are you ready?

607
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:16,141
Speaker 0: over/under on five Gritties at PAX unplugged.

608
00:40:16,404 --> 00:40:22,743
Speaker 1: Ooh I Think I'm gonna say under but I think there's gonna be like three or four.

609
00:40:22,763 --> 00:40:23,285
Speaker 0: He's easy.

610
00:40:23,305 --> 00:40:23,767
Speaker 0: three or four.

611
00:40:23,787 --> 00:40:27,898
Speaker 0: Yeah And I think it's gonna be five.

612
00:40:27,919 --> 00:40:28,562
Speaker 0: That's why I put it.

613
00:40:28,582 --> 00:40:32,197
Speaker 1: if I'm saying under cuz I think there's Gonna be I think there's gonna be three or four.

614
00:40:32,217 --> 00:40:36,370
Speaker 1: I'm gonna push but I think two of them will be anti-foss specifically.

615
00:40:41,213 --> 00:40:42,096
Speaker 1: We should bet money on this.

616
00:40:42,277 --> 00:40:43,161
Speaker 1: we should take a.

617
00:40:43,382 --> 00:40:44,305
Speaker 0: no, I'm the bookie.

618
00:40:44,325 --> 00:40:45,209
Speaker 0: that's why I set the odd.

619
00:40:48,296 --> 00:40:49,570
Speaker 1: Say we're gonna be there's gonna be awesome.

620
00:40:49,651 --> 00:40:50,725
Speaker 0: He always pushes.

621
00:40:50,827 --> 00:40:51,579
Speaker 0: otherwise There's that in.

622
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:52,149
Speaker 0: the odds are huh?

623
00:40:52,410 --> 00:41:01,997
Speaker 1: And also if you are having trouble with Twitter and want somewhere else to go just point out the geek nights forum is a Nazi free social network.

624
00:41:02,277 --> 00:41:05,830
Speaker 1: That's pretty like there's a lot of people in there talking about cool stuff.

625
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:10,670
Speaker 0: It's also a great place like, you know, a lot of people have sort of set up blog in there.

626
00:41:11,031 --> 00:41:13,281
Speaker 0: Yeah, they just make a thread and make it their blog.

627
00:41:13,301 --> 00:41:18,681
Speaker 1: Yeah, like look chaos Chaos of 99 just posted two reviews and anime in here.

628
00:41:19,223 --> 00:41:20,729
Speaker 1: Yeah, like good to go like that.

629
00:41:21,291 --> 00:41:25,949
Speaker 1: Seriously, like our only rule is you can't be a Nazi in here and we enforce it.

630
00:41:26,715 --> 00:41:27,763
Speaker 1: You also can't be shitty.

631
00:41:27,884 --> 00:41:28,629
Speaker 1: it's the only other rule.

632
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:31,049
Speaker 1: We enforce that one and it works out pretty well.

633
00:41:31,391 --> 00:41:32,496
Speaker 1: So seriously, forget Twitter.

634
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:33,842
Speaker 1: join the geek nights forum.

635
00:41:33,962 --> 00:41:34,424
Speaker 1: it like.

636
00:41:34,505 --> 00:41:35,650
Speaker 1: I personally vouch for it.

637
00:41:35,971 --> 00:41:39,545
Speaker 0: I hang out and I personally vouch for my own forum that I'm in charge of.

638
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:45,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz you know what all I did Yeah, and all I did was kick out the Nazis and the shitty people.

639
00:41:45,991 --> 00:41:47,829
Speaker 0: Nazis can't even get in because they got to apply.

640
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:48,572
Speaker 0: Oh, that's one thing.

641
00:41:48,592 --> 00:42:00,810
Speaker 0: if you when you apply it makes you type in a reason you are applying and you have to type in Plain-english something that makes me believe that you are not a bot and not a Nazi and that you're like a listener of the show.

642
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:09,937
Speaker 0: Some people have typed some really good stuff in there Some people have tied good stuff and I instantly approved and some people typed like, you know Want to discuss and that is not enough.

643
00:42:10,098 --> 00:42:14,150
Speaker 1: No that is not getting you in and frankly that those might have been real people.

644
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:24,227
Speaker 1: But something that's been bothering me lately and I think about this a lot is the people I encounter online who Fail the Turing test if I administer it.

645
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:25,908
Speaker 1: yet I know they are real people.

646
00:42:26,512 --> 00:42:33,270
Speaker 1: So I decided and Scott agrees in the forum at least if you fail the reverse Turing test You don't get in even if you're a human.

647
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:39,170
Speaker 0: All you have to do is type something in the box that I a human being I'm going to read with my own eyeballs.

648
00:42:39,471 --> 00:42:41,542
Speaker 0: That will convince me to push the approve button.

649
00:42:41,723 --> 00:42:41,944
Speaker 0: Yep.

650
00:42:42,285 --> 00:42:43,089
Speaker 0: That's all you got to do.

651
00:42:43,432 --> 00:42:45,610
Speaker 1: If you say something about Grady, you're pretty much guaranteed.

652
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:48,710
Speaker 0: If you say like hi, I'm not pushing approve.

653
00:42:49,071 --> 00:42:54,112
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you say I am a geek nights listener and you told me to listen to the yeah I'm gonna click approve.

654
00:42:54,393 --> 00:42:56,279
Speaker 1: if you say jet fuel can melt steel beams.

655
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,469
Speaker 1: I agree that you're a human, but you're not getting into the forum.

656
00:43:02,493 --> 00:43:06,070
Speaker 0: That one could be paired might be joking like in the right way.

657
00:43:06,311 --> 00:43:10,284
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you could be that the problem is you can't always tell.

658
00:43:10,304 --> 00:43:11,970
Speaker 0: I think I think you know.

659
00:43:13,778 --> 00:43:14,609
Speaker 0: It would be a close call.

660
00:43:16,851 --> 00:43:19,743
Speaker 1: You know what this is a special for the next 48 hours.

661
00:43:19,803 --> 00:43:25,033
Speaker 1: if you type jet fuel can't melt steel beams You're definitely getting in because it means you listen to this episode For

662
00:43:25,073 --> 00:43:25,314
Speaker 0: sure,

663
00:43:25,696 --> 00:43:26,299
Speaker 1: and if you did

664
00:43:26,439 --> 00:43:28,850
Speaker 0: odds of someone typing that in who had not listened

665
00:43:29,091 --> 00:43:35,625
Speaker 1: I'll put it this way if someone types that in in the next 48 hours and didn't listen to this episode It's gonna be funny either way.

666
00:43:36,088 --> 00:43:39,176
Speaker 1: Sure All right, that was like 45 minutes.

667
00:43:39,196 --> 00:43:40,260
Speaker 1: Let's talk about live streaming.

668
00:43:41,002 --> 00:43:42,788
Speaker 0: So we did a show on live streaming already.

669
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:49,094
Speaker 0: We did in 2013 where it was literally a completely different world and we had Didn't.

670
00:43:49,175 --> 00:43:51,224
Speaker 0: I think we tried to live stream it and fail to do so.

671
00:43:51,345 --> 00:43:59,370
Speaker 1: quote tonight on geek nights We talked about live streaming video while streaming said video live and discovering after the fact that the video ended up stuttery as fuck.

672
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:00,246
Speaker 1: Sorry about that.

673
00:44:01,952 --> 00:44:04,560
Speaker 1: And then we talked about phone numbers, which is funny.

674
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:09,577
Speaker 1: Okay, and Scott reviews the iPad the iPad mini Yep, 2013 ladies and gentlemen.

675
00:44:09,798 --> 00:44:10,079
Speaker 0: Okay.

676
00:44:10,561 --> 00:44:11,785
Speaker 1: So here we are in 2018.

677
00:44:11,785 --> 00:44:15,196
Speaker 1: We're Live-streaming is completely different.

678
00:44:15,638 --> 00:44:17,343
Speaker 1: Like the technology is way better.

679
00:44:17,383 --> 00:44:18,206
Speaker 1: There's a lot more tools.

680
00:44:18,587 --> 00:44:19,470
Speaker 1: It's just working.

681
00:44:19,792 --> 00:44:20,133
Speaker 1: We like.

682
00:44:20,153 --> 00:44:20,596
Speaker 0: I don't think.

683
00:44:20,676 --> 00:44:29,030
Speaker 0: I think the main difference is that it's just easier and it works But technologically it isn't very much different other than our computers are better and YouTube and Twitter better.

684
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:31,098
Speaker 1: Here's what I'll say processors got a lot faster.

685
00:44:31,158 --> 00:44:32,825
Speaker 1: That's actually a big important thing.

686
00:44:32,885 --> 00:44:36,678
Speaker 1: like GPUs can help Yep, but seriously the processors in particular.

687
00:44:36,678 --> 00:44:40,730
Speaker 1: 2 gigahertz is about the line below 2 gigahertz.

688
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:42,430
Speaker 1: You really couldn't do modern streaming.

689
00:44:42,952 --> 00:44:49,271
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz the first thing about streaming right is that you got a camera and the camera sends video to a computer of some Kind.

690
00:44:49,332 --> 00:44:54,656
Speaker 0: Yep, that is connect to the internet or over USB 2 or your camera has a computer in it That is connected to the internet.

691
00:44:54,736 --> 00:44:57,690
Speaker 0: But either way, you know, that's what your phone's doing when you live stream, right?

692
00:44:58,171 --> 00:45:08,730
Speaker 0: It must take that video it is capturing with its camera and turn it into Like a video file with encoding and that is a CPU intensive process.

693
00:45:09,112 --> 00:45:11,803
Speaker 0: You could even get the GPU in on it to help you if you want.

694
00:45:11,964 --> 00:45:16,570
Speaker 1: now like it wasn't that long ago This was hard to do non real time.

695
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:17,952
Speaker 0: Yeah back in the day We're using

696
00:45:17,972 --> 00:45:20,020
Speaker 1: like fraps to try to record a game

697
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:28,997
Speaker 0: or like just using something like, you know You take a DVD you rip it and you'd want to turn that DVD File into a different video file

698
00:45:29,137 --> 00:45:31,704
Speaker 1: that took longer than the running length of the DVD.

699
00:45:31,744 --> 00:45:40,424
Speaker 0: took a computer a in those days My Pentium 3 or whatever a long time to do that, dude It used to take me like two hours to rip a CD.

700
00:45:40,444 --> 00:45:46,750
Speaker 0: if you want a live stream Not only do you need to transcode video you need to do it in real time.

701
00:45:46,870 --> 00:46:00,670
Speaker 0: so if you are streaming at 30 FPS video your computer needs to be able to take a frame of video and turn it into Video data and then upload it to the internet 30 times a second without fucking up.

702
00:46:01,591 --> 00:46:03,844
Speaker 0: Otherwise your video is gonna go up for a frame.

703
00:46:03,884 --> 00:46:04,889
Speaker 0: Yeah every time you fuck up.

704
00:46:05,211 --> 00:46:14,395
Speaker 1: So we needed hardware to catch up which it did like hardware today just had I mean that's 2013 computer could do it barely Mmm, it was.

705
00:46:14,496 --> 00:46:15,500
Speaker 1: I believe we couldn't do it.

706
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,925
Speaker 0: It was.

707
00:46:16,965 --> 00:46:18,110
Speaker 0: it wasn't our computer's fault.

708
00:46:18,834 --> 00:46:20,845
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it was our computer in those days.

709
00:46:20,885 --> 00:46:29,700
Speaker 1: It was the fault of Because remember even the Elgato we're on unless I unless I overclock to above 2 gigahertz They actually couldn't keep up any early days.

710
00:46:29,881 --> 00:46:34,499
Speaker 0: Anyway, the next problem you need is You got to get some software that actually does this.

711
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:41,504
Speaker 1: so in 2013 the like point 0.3 alpha version of OBS existed meaning it didn't really exist.

712
00:46:41,585 --> 00:46:43,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like there weren't great.

713
00:46:43,712 --> 00:46:50,476
Speaker 0: You know the software available for this sort of thing, you know has as over time, you know There was expensive stuff that did it.

714
00:46:50,536 --> 00:46:54,930
Speaker 0: there was stuff meant for actual TV stations to you like remember Adobe on location.

715
00:46:55,171 --> 00:46:56,778
Speaker 1: Of course you don't right this.

716
00:46:56,878 --> 00:46:57,441
Speaker 0: I remember it.

717
00:46:57,461 --> 00:46:59,690
Speaker 1: I used to try to use it all sorts of different solutions.

718
00:46:59,811 --> 00:47:02,241
Speaker 0: Most of them were like ultra professional expensive things.

719
00:47:02,582 --> 00:47:03,767
Speaker 1: now ashen coder.

720
00:47:03,827 --> 00:47:07,084
Speaker 0: right now There's OBS and if you want to pay some money you can get X split.

721
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:07,587
Speaker 0: and is this?

722
00:47:07,889 --> 00:47:10,823
Speaker 0: you know This OBS is what you're gonna use probably honestly.

723
00:47:10,884 --> 00:47:13,778
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, it's not perfect But it works also.

724
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:21,204
Speaker 1: OBS just in the last two years Has gotten good to the point that it is suitable for professional usage.

725
00:47:21,325 --> 00:47:23,190
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah it because it works, right?

726
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:25,237
Speaker 0: It's not user interface wise.

727
00:47:25,317 --> 00:47:26,340
Speaker 0: it is still very poofy.

728
00:47:26,641 --> 00:47:29,290
Speaker 1: Ah, I would argue that it's better than current X split.

729
00:47:30,151 --> 00:47:31,416
Speaker 0: I mean X split isn't the greatest.

730
00:47:31,436 --> 00:47:33,183
Speaker 1: It's like kind of the shitty interface.

731
00:47:33,203 --> 00:47:33,645
Speaker 0: They're both.

732
00:47:33,765 --> 00:47:34,629
Speaker 0: they're both poofy.

733
00:47:35,512 --> 00:47:36,657
Speaker 1: No, I would argue that.

734
00:47:36,717 --> 00:47:38,745
Speaker 1: have you have you used the current version of OBS?

735
00:47:38,786 --> 00:47:41,328
Speaker 0: Yes, cuz my expert license It's better not renewing it.

736
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:45,023
Speaker 1: The oh at the UX of OBS is in my opinion really really good.

737
00:47:45,063 --> 00:47:46,870
Speaker 0: because I would not say it's really really good.

738
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:54,160
Speaker 1: I'd say it's really really good because no people who don't know anything about this technology Can just turn it on and it just works.

739
00:47:54,441 --> 00:47:56,750
Speaker 1: because it got over a line that most open-source software.

740
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:57,512
Speaker 1: It never gets over.

741
00:47:57,793 --> 00:48:03,732
Speaker 1: the line of the intelligent defaults just work and you only need to click in all these menus if you're doing Something weird.

742
00:48:03,933 --> 00:48:05,698
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's still not.

743
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:08,167
Speaker 0: it's not exactly an Apple product, right?

744
00:48:08,347 --> 00:48:09,170
Speaker 0: It is still janky.

745
00:48:09,331 --> 00:48:11,841
Speaker 0: It's just got some like rectangle buttons that someone threw together.

746
00:48:11,862 --> 00:48:13,790
Speaker 0: So there no no design.

747
00:48:15,132 --> 00:48:21,175
Speaker 1: There is no Apple like Apple like product that just works for Complex streaming use cases.

748
00:48:21,436 --> 00:48:23,201
Speaker 0: Is this just the crazy expensive professional one?

749
00:48:23,281 --> 00:48:24,926
Speaker 1: Like what name one?

750
00:48:24,987 --> 00:48:26,070
Speaker 0: What's that fucking thing called?

751
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:27,474
Speaker 1: Yeah, I do wire cast.

752
00:48:27,755 --> 00:48:28,437
Speaker 1: Have you used it?

753
00:48:28,718 --> 00:48:29,721
Speaker 0: No, this isn't.

754
00:48:29,741 --> 00:48:34,496
Speaker 0: there's like a you know, I forget what it's called Adobe has a professional one.

755
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:36,403
Speaker 1: That is the successor to on location.

756
00:48:36,484 --> 00:48:37,427
Speaker 1: that things a piece of shit.

757
00:48:37,467 --> 00:48:38,130
Speaker 1: You don't use that.

758
00:48:38,251 --> 00:48:42,565
Speaker 0: No, no, no, there's like a thing that they actually use it like Like TV stations and shit.

759
00:48:42,605 --> 00:48:43,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what?

760
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:43,912
Speaker 1: But what one?

761
00:48:43,932 --> 00:48:46,484
Speaker 1: there's hardware solutions that have like proprietor there.

762
00:48:46,524 --> 00:48:49,719
Speaker 1: those things are so hard to use That you remember the old TriCaster.

763
00:48:49,739 --> 00:48:50,442
Speaker 1: they feel like that.

764
00:48:50,603 --> 00:48:52,090
Speaker 0: the point is you're gonna use OBS, right?

765
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:57,420
Speaker 0: And now OBS you you if you are intelligent enough to listen to gig nights You're intelligent enough to figure it out, even though it's poopy.

766
00:48:57,942 --> 00:48:59,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it works and it's free.

767
00:48:59,953 --> 00:49:02,290
Speaker 1: So the other thing that caught up is computers.

768
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:02,873
Speaker 1: It's not just.

769
00:49:02,914 --> 00:49:05,810
Speaker 1: they were fast enough to encode all the video stream and send it live.

770
00:49:06,351 --> 00:49:07,755
Speaker 1: They got fast enough to.

771
00:49:07,775 --> 00:49:17,709
Speaker 1: it's like I'm sending three video streams to OBS and like four audio streams and Muxing and mixing them all together and those are two different things and sending a composite stream.

772
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:21,271
Speaker 1: Computers were definitely not fucking fast enough to do that in 2013.

773
00:49:21,271 --> 00:49:30,450
Speaker 0: Well, the main other thing is that you're right you could when you're streaming You could try to stream directly to the people watching which is what a lot of people tried to do back in the day.

774
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:34,284
Speaker 0: They would get their own server and stream to it and then people would connect to their server.

775
00:49:34,505 --> 00:49:38,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, then I remember What was it the hurricane in New Orleans?

776
00:49:38,741 --> 00:49:43,188
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was like a live stream of Someplace flooding and I was watching it.

777
00:49:43,671 --> 00:50:00,150
Speaker 0: But it's like there was like a hundred people watching this guy's webcam in his flooded store and it's like he was running that off his own hosted computer and That computer couldn't really handle because it had to upload data to how many people they didn't have the bandwidth to upload to.

778
00:50:00,371 --> 00:50:02,179
Speaker 0: Yep, right so many people cuz like.

779
00:50:02,259 --> 00:50:08,630
Speaker 0: okay all the CPU part has already been done But these JPEGs need is in 30 JPEGs a second every time.

780
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:13,450
Speaker 0: Alright, so you're sending out 30 JPEGs a second and you get a second person watching now.

781
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:16,043
Speaker 0: You're sending out 60 JPEGs right now right now in the life.

782
00:50:16,063 --> 00:50:18,995
Speaker 0: You get a third person watching now You're sitting on 90 JPEGs a second.

783
00:50:19,215 --> 00:50:23,890
Speaker 1: They're a linear scaling and not only that but quality wise like quality is going up.

784
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:28,730
Speaker 1: So the the default the bitrate you want to use in the modern era is about six megabits per second.

785
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:35,758
Speaker 1: Yeah, like sending more than that is a special use case already and you're sending out, you know It's 1080p video.

786
00:50:35,879 --> 00:50:40,035
Speaker 0: Yeah, so six megabits per second Those 30 frames are 1080p each.

787
00:50:40,396 --> 00:50:47,977
Speaker 1: six megabits per second times the 13 people watching this stream live right now is Already not cheap.

788
00:50:48,318 --> 00:51:17,646
Speaker 0: Yeah, so thankfully nowadays because of YouTube and Twitch And other you know companies that are providing streaming services You just stream your one stream to them and now they with their massive massive computers will a transcode it again into many different formats of someone watching on their phone watching on a TV or someone watching on a 4k screen or someone watching on a tablet or someone watching on a shitty low-res computer or all kinds of different screens are gonna get any.

789
00:51:17,907 --> 00:51:28,499
Speaker 0: or someone watching with really little bandwidth are gonna get an appropriate video for them because it's been transcoded so many times and also They're the ones handling the scaling part.

790
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,767
Speaker 0: You only have to handle the 130 JPEGs a second.

791
00:51:32,573 --> 00:51:39,281
Speaker 0: Then if you get a hundred viewers or a thousand viewers or ten thousand viewers, that's on them And for some reason they're providing that for free.

792
00:51:39,946 --> 00:51:42,985
Speaker 0: I'll take it Sure, provide me that bandwidth for free.

793
00:51:43,046 --> 00:51:43,429
Speaker 0: Thank you.

794
00:51:43,891 --> 00:51:50,570
Speaker 1: So I think what really made that like what made that difference is gaming streaming in particular took off big.

795
00:51:51,156 --> 00:51:58,770
Speaker 1: They must be making money But it made a consumer market which meant that now like tools like do you know how many like?

796
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:02,404
Speaker 1: Supplemental pieces of software exist to make live streaming easier.

797
00:52:02,725 --> 00:52:06,238
Speaker 1: how much hardware like Consumers and prosumers can buy?

798
00:52:06,258 --> 00:52:07,503
Speaker 1: that'll just make this stuff work.

799
00:52:07,844 --> 00:52:09,892
Speaker 1: None of that existed in 2013.

800
00:52:09,892 --> 00:52:12,202
Speaker 1: Remember the Elgato and what a piece of shit that thing was.

801
00:52:12,805 --> 00:52:13,870
Speaker 1: we've come a long way.

802
00:52:14,432 --> 00:52:18,510
Speaker 0: I mean the Elgato actually was good and worked until it just suddenly stopped working.

803
00:52:18,711 --> 00:52:24,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, well the trouble with mine was that my laptop was not powerful enough to encode because they didn't do the encoding.

804
00:52:24,775 --> 00:52:27,110
Speaker 1: It was basically just a glorified video capture device.

805
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:34,526
Speaker 0: I mean the Aver thing I have now also is just a glorified video capture device Except it just works instead of the Aver which didn't work.

806
00:52:34,586 --> 00:52:35,310
Speaker 0: I mean the Elgato.

807
00:52:35,631 --> 00:52:37,236
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Aver one I have works.

808
00:52:37,557 --> 00:52:42,028
Speaker 0: the Elgato one just broke eventually, but effectively they're like the same functionality Yep.

809
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:50,503
Speaker 1: But also the fact that streaming got built into a lot of games and a lot of software Like consoles will just live stream like.

810
00:52:50,523 --> 00:53:08,449
Speaker 1: there's all this live streaming culture Which made a market for technology to make live streaming easier for non-professionals and Professionals are just reaping the benefits of having access to all these free or cheap tools Like there's so much more available than there was in 2013 that it's staggering

811
00:53:08,509 --> 00:53:08,750
Speaker 0: right now.

812
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:17,770
Speaker 0: There's certain things you might want to do if you're doing some advanced streaming and some of those things Are very difficult to do still and some of them have gotten easier.

813
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:25,220
Speaker 0: So for example, one thing I like to do is I stream one time, but I want to stream to YouTube and Twitch at the same time.

814
00:53:25,301 --> 00:53:36,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, so right now with my computer I could stream to YouTube and Twitch and record a different resolution like a high Quality version to my hard drive and it would even put a dent in my computer, right?

815
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:38,300
Speaker 0: But the thing is you would it would still.

816
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:42,503
Speaker 0: if I did that from my computer I would have to use double bandwidth double bandwidth.

817
00:53:42,523 --> 00:53:46,169
Speaker 0: So there's a website Restream.io that provides the service for free.

818
00:53:46,571 --> 00:53:57,636
Speaker 0: I stream to restream.io using RTMP and then with RTMP is basically like the HTTP of streaming yep, and then they stream to YouTube and Twitch and But it's already very telling.

819
00:53:57,676 --> 00:54:04,310
Speaker 1: when I was first doing live streaming and attempting to do it I had to actually know a lot about RTMP worked and like set stuff up

820
00:54:04,832 --> 00:54:17,025
Speaker 0: If you don't want to use some sort of service like restream in order to do this You have to set up like your own server somewhere and that will do this Restreaming for you and you stream to it and then it streams to the right and like.

821
00:54:17,065 --> 00:54:21,210
Speaker 0: if you want to say combine your Stream and your friends stream together like your friends at home.

822
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:36,910
Speaker 0: You're at home and you want to combine your streams together into one video frame you need to like set up a server and your friends streams to it and then your Your friend at you add your friends stream as a source to your stream and things get complicated real quick.

823
00:54:37,697 --> 00:54:43,430
Speaker 1: Yep, so The fact that like OBS just has a button that's like I am connecting to YouTube.

824
00:54:43,891 --> 00:54:45,175
Speaker 1: I'm connecting to the other service.

825
00:54:45,436 --> 00:54:49,769
Speaker 1: like you can set up manual streams new clever stuff, but you don't have to yep.

826
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:51,618
Speaker 0: So a twitch con which just happened.

827
00:54:51,638 --> 00:54:55,858
Speaker 0: they announced that they're gonna add slowly I think towards the end of the year.

828
00:54:55,898 --> 00:55:00,320
Speaker 0: this year, they're gonna add it for select streamers But then hopefully next year for everybody.

829
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:06,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's quad stream and the way shit We're gonna use this because there's a thing we wanted to do that would be a pain to do without this.

830
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:07,595
Speaker 0: The way it works is.

831
00:55:07,716 --> 00:55:09,970
Speaker 0: I streamed my twitch rim streams to his twitch channel.

832
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:13,320
Speaker 0: We got two channels going but we're both playing counter-strike.

833
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:19,150
Speaker 0: Let's say right, but then I go on twitch and I say yo twitch Rim, he and my squad and then rim does the same thing.

834
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:19,993
Speaker 0: I guess I don't know.

835
00:55:20,434 --> 00:55:34,906
Speaker 0: and then when you watch my channel, you'll see under the big video box Which has me in it a little video box, which is rim in it and you can click on that to switch Between us and you'll basically be able to swap channels really quickly between both of us.

836
00:55:34,946 --> 00:55:46,010
Speaker 0: and whichever channel you're on You're gonna see the other channel in a small box And if we've got a whole team of say 10 people playing a game There'll be nine little boxes and the one big one that you're watching currently.

837
00:55:46,492 --> 00:55:50,427
Speaker 0: So now you can sort of see all the perspectives on a single event.

838
00:55:50,748 --> 00:55:53,967
Speaker 0: if you know Ten channels are all streaming sort of together.

839
00:55:54,128 --> 00:56:00,013
Speaker 0: Yep And that saves you a lot of the trouble of doing say those RTMP tricks I just talked about.

840
00:56:00,414 --> 00:56:02,341
Speaker 0: so setting up servers and all that nonsense.

841
00:56:02,582 --> 00:56:12,769
Speaker 1: the two problems that remain Really like in terms of live-streaming today seem to be that Most people who want to do it don't know how to make their audio sound good.

842
00:56:13,111 --> 00:56:19,690
Speaker 0: Yep, but that's that's also partly the fault of the tools like OBS and X split not helping you out too much.

843
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:20,433
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, they do.

844
00:56:20,453 --> 00:56:23,790
Speaker 1: There's a whole compressor chain built into OBS now that just works.

845
00:56:24,071 --> 00:56:25,658
Speaker 0: Yes, but it is not some.

846
00:56:25,779 --> 00:56:27,607
Speaker 0: it is not an intelligent default, right?

847
00:56:27,687 --> 00:56:28,270
Speaker 1: Actually it is.

848
00:56:28,492 --> 00:56:29,562
Speaker 1: Did you try to recently?

849
00:56:29,602 --> 00:56:30,410
Speaker 1: they really up their game?

850
00:56:31,572 --> 00:56:31,974
Speaker 0: You have to.

851
00:56:31,994 --> 00:56:34,082
Speaker 0: you have to click something to turn it on.

852
00:56:34,143 --> 00:56:35,327
Speaker 0: it's not just automatic.

853
00:56:35,368 --> 00:56:35,950
Speaker 0: it happens you don't.

854
00:56:36,091 --> 00:56:42,939
Speaker 0: If you start playing a game and your game is too loud It doesn't intelligently adjust to match your game.

855
00:56:42,999 --> 00:56:43,862
Speaker 1: And so the right.

856
00:56:43,962 --> 00:56:46,210
Speaker 1: the problem there is a little more fundamental though.

857
00:56:46,411 --> 00:56:49,603
Speaker 0: It needs something that automatically looks to see how loud your game is.

858
00:56:49,884 --> 00:56:54,260
Speaker 0: how loud you're talking is Adjust both automatically without you having to sit there and fiddle with.

859
00:56:54,401 --> 00:57:00,770
Speaker 1: that doesn't even exist in like professional settings And it probably won't anytime in the foreseeable future.

860
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:01,874
Speaker 0: Oh, whoa, because

861
00:57:01,934 --> 00:57:02,636
Speaker 1: honestly and

862
00:57:02,676 --> 00:57:06,931
Speaker 0: that's why no matter how good they make it unless they make it that good people continue to fuck it up,

863
00:57:07,153 --> 00:57:22,690
Speaker 1: but that what it means is that Live-streaming unlocks like all this stuff for people who know the basics of video and audio production None of this stuff helps you with like three-point lighting know or how to use a microphone.

864
00:57:23,193 --> 00:57:25,729
Speaker 1: No, and the other problem is that?

865
00:57:27,031 --> 00:57:35,326
Speaker 1: No solution that any of you will have access to will Synchronize the audio and video across all the multiple sources.

866
00:57:35,346 --> 00:57:36,370
Speaker 1: You're trying to mux together.

867
00:57:36,771 --> 00:57:40,723
Speaker 1: There's a reason why my mouth and Scott's mouth don't 100% match.

868
00:57:40,743 --> 00:57:41,265
Speaker 1: what's on that?

869
00:57:41,325 --> 00:57:42,970
Speaker 1: because this is a webcam.

870
00:57:43,432 --> 00:57:44,817
Speaker 1: That is a different webcam.

871
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:48,210
Speaker 1: This is going through a firewire mixer right a hardware.

872
00:57:49,074 --> 00:57:53,070
Speaker 0: Let's say I'm looking at a webcam and the webcam has a microphone built in right.

873
00:57:53,130 --> 00:58:03,190
Speaker 0: So if I just use the webcam only and the microphone built into the web perfect sync It will be perfectly synchronized because that webcam is synchronizing the video and the audio that it captures.

874
00:58:03,793 --> 00:58:06,650
Speaker 0: So when it we stream from the webcam, everything's gonna be great.

875
00:58:06,931 --> 00:58:14,122
Speaker 0: But if I turn off the microphone in the webcam and use a different microphone How can I sync or synchronize this microphone with the webcam video?

876
00:58:14,323 --> 00:58:15,847
Speaker 0: The answer is you fucking can't.

877
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:16,710
Speaker 0: it's almost impossible.

878
00:58:16,839 --> 00:58:23,915
Speaker 1: Yep now with most of the ways you would do this you could try to set an offset like look at it and figure out like Oh, it's about two milliseconds off.

879
00:58:23,955 --> 00:58:29,130
Speaker 1: So put a delay in one of the lines, but the problem is usually that latency is non-deterministic.

880
00:58:29,911 --> 00:58:33,749
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then you got say you drop a frame here and there and all the weird stuff happens.

881
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:41,124
Speaker 0: It's like, you know that you get your computer involved in this, you know You could try to synchronize it outside of the computer using some sort of device and that would.

882
00:58:41,305 --> 00:58:43,053
Speaker 0: that would get you right where you Need to be.

883
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:47,529
Speaker 0: but if you try to synchronize it in the computer Things are gonna get off.

884
00:58:48,152 --> 00:58:50,158
Speaker 1: So this is why like you're gonna drift.

885
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:57,642
Speaker 1: if like part of the reason why I got that fancy camcorder with the XLR inputs Is that say we're gonna do a live stream of like a board game thing.

886
00:58:57,662 --> 00:59:04,590
Speaker 1: I would actually take the main audio Into the camera directly via the two XLR cables.

887
00:59:04,911 --> 00:59:13,370
Speaker 1: So there's at least one set of two channels of audio that are guaranteed in sync at the time of encoding With at least one of my video channels.

888
00:59:13,913 --> 00:59:18,312
Speaker 0: And a pro tip is most of the time all that matters is that your mouth is Synchronized.

889
00:59:18,393 --> 00:59:22,569
Speaker 0: people don't really care if the other audio is like half a millisecond off that they won't notice, right?

890
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:30,590
Speaker 0: We're playing a board game and that the the table is like a few milliseconds drifted and no one will notice.

891
00:59:30,852 --> 00:59:32,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only notice of our mouths are drifted.

892
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:38,710
Speaker 0: So that's sub millisecond to synchronize the camera and the audio and video with our the mouth camera.

893
00:59:39,011 --> 00:59:40,316
Speaker 0: Yep, that shows our face.

894
00:59:41,158 --> 00:59:48,730
Speaker 1: and I guess the only other problem that remains it really is You know the rest of the production cycle like lighting and like color and like all that stuff.

895
00:59:49,031 --> 00:59:51,261
Speaker 1: There really aren't prosumers allusions to that.

896
00:59:51,803 --> 00:59:57,184
Speaker 1: in terms of the streaming technology That's just make a recording studio make a soundstage.

897
00:59:57,425 --> 00:59:57,827
Speaker 1: Guess what?

898
00:59:57,867 --> 00:59:58,750
Speaker 1: It's huge and it sucks.

899
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:02,141
Speaker 0: That's most people even professional streamers get away with.

900
01:00:02,462 --> 01:00:05,070
Speaker 0: you know, put a light in front of you of some kind.

901
01:00:05,391 --> 01:00:08,984
Speaker 0: It's bright enough use a camera or a webcam that's good.

902
01:00:09,024 --> 01:00:09,927
Speaker 0: That's expensive.

903
01:00:09,947 --> 01:00:10,650
Speaker 0: That's fancy.

904
01:00:10,733 --> 01:00:12,534
Speaker 0: Yeah I just 1080p or 4k.

905
01:00:12,975 --> 01:00:20,930
Speaker 0: and then some people the one thing they do that's actually not very difficult and is made actually very easy Is to do some chroma key to erase the background.

906
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:25,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, and what you do is you buy a green screen, which is just a big green sheet.

907
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:32,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, you put it behind you and in fact, there are some webcam solutions that can sort of green screen without a green screen.

908
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:36,570
Speaker 0: They sort of figure it out and sort of draw the line around you really shittily, but they work.

909
01:00:37,772 --> 01:00:40,785
Speaker 0: And that way you could say appear in the corner of your video.

910
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:43,869
Speaker 0: there you are of your game There you are, but there's nothing around you.

911
01:00:44,111 --> 01:00:46,929
Speaker 0: You're just sort of super imposed on front of the game like a ghost.

912
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:52,969
Speaker 0: Yeah Or you sort of erase your room So no one can see what's in your house and you put something else behind you.

913
01:00:53,291 --> 01:00:53,511
Speaker 0: But

914
01:00:53,752 --> 01:00:56,178
Speaker 1: the reality is even now short of a

915
01:00:56,258 --> 01:00:57,040
Speaker 0: city or a

916
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:10,489
Speaker 1: fire short of like pop culture mainstream stuff like most streaming Content is what matters more than anything as long as your quality is above the line kind of like the early days of podcasting Yeah, so production values mean nothing unless your content is good.

917
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:11,533
Speaker 1: Yeah, and like.

918
01:01:11,553 --> 01:01:16,610
Speaker 1: for us audio is the main content, which is why my audio pipeline costs a lot more than my video pipeline.

919
01:01:16,831 --> 01:01:24,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, the one other thing is if you are doing game streaming specifically You're gonna want to add like especially I'm like a twitch situation.

920
01:01:24,531 --> 01:01:28,229
Speaker 0: You got to add like these graphics like someone just subscribed and you know.

921
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:31,330
Speaker 1: But again, software just exists to make all this happen.

922
01:01:31,330 --> 01:01:32,925
Speaker 0: The stuff that GDQ has, right?

923
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:37,520
Speaker 0: You know that like where it's like they're showing the donations on there and stuff And it's like.

924
01:01:37,561 --> 01:01:38,229
Speaker 0: how do you do that?

925
01:01:38,610 --> 01:01:41,950
Speaker 0: Basically, they make like a web page that shows all that stuff.

926
01:01:42,714 --> 01:01:49,270
Speaker 0: Or they make some sort of program that just displays all those graphics And then has green in it in the spots they want to erase.

927
01:01:49,511 --> 01:01:59,409
Speaker 1: You can either buy like packages and plugins that do this stuff Or like even OBS has plug-in points like point it at a URL point it at a rest service Like it'll just kind of work.

928
01:01:59,530 --> 01:02:03,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can just make an exe run it and then add it as like, you know.

929
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:09,706
Speaker 0: So it's like you're streaming two games and one of the games on top of the other game and one of them is see-through Right stuff like that.

930
01:02:11,132 --> 01:02:11,938
Speaker 0: So it's actually it's.

931
01:02:12,059 --> 01:02:12,401
Speaker 0: it's like.

932
01:02:12,421 --> 01:02:13,630
Speaker 0: you're like, whoa, how do they do that?

933
01:02:13,710 --> 01:02:16,361
Speaker 0: It's actually really easy once you see someone do it.

934
01:02:16,422 --> 01:02:18,330
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, that's how you done it.

935
01:02:18,511 --> 01:02:26,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's really janky and simple But they're actually it's really hard to search online for how to do that.

936
01:02:27,096 --> 01:02:28,670
Speaker 0: It's like not well documented.

937
01:02:29,051 --> 01:02:32,262
Speaker 0: So you sort of need someone to show you and then it becomes obvious.

938
01:02:32,885 --> 01:02:33,968
Speaker 1: and on that note, I'm hungry.

939
01:02:34,109 --> 01:02:42,450
Speaker 1: So This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

940
