8
00:00:40,862 --> 00:00:48,719
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is the one that temporarily This is the one that ends when our boy Diocletian comes in and says oh, yeah.

00:01:41,029 --> 00:01:44,690
Speaker 1: for How many years 15 year we run out of idea?

19
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:51,804

20
00:01:51,844 --> 00:01:54,050
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, so, you know not done to get in a meta.

21
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,470
Speaker 0: But we go to a lot of gaming cons and a lot of generic nerd cons.

22
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,401
Speaker 1: Going to an anime con wouldn't give me.

23
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,710
Speaker 1: I don't watch more anime at an enemy con.

24
00:02:04,131 --> 00:02:05,536
Speaker 1: Give me more Wednesday shows.

25
00:02:05,737 --> 00:02:07,703

Speaker 0: Yeah tech news roundup.

30
00:02:19,064 --> 00:02:21,350
Speaker 1: No, I gotta wait two more months.

00:02:28,754 --> 00:02:30,340
Speaker 0: that clock rings once a year.

35
00:02:31,023 --> 00:02:32,750
Speaker 0: I wake up and I'm like, what are we gonna do the Monday show?

36
00:02:33,731 --> 00:02:35,357
Speaker 0: Tech news roundup, is it true?

37
00:02:35,437 --> 00:02:40,782
Speaker 0: and I have to look and double-check the last time we did it and then I say Scott Let's do a tech news roundup and Scott will always say

38
00:02:40,923 --> 00:02:41,385
Speaker 1: so we

39
00:02:41,426 --> 00:02:48,976
Speaker 0: just did one There's no way and then we'll look cuz I deleted the one we just did from the CMS and then we do All right.

40
00:02:49,418 --> 00:02:51,928
Speaker 0: So in some news as you guys know, I still play overwatch.

41
00:02:51,948 --> 00:02:57,800
Speaker 0: like a lot Overwatch is my favorite like, you know You got your games that you play because they're knowing that it.

42
00:02:57,821 --> 00:02:58,885
Speaker 1: when did overwatch come out?

43
00:02:58,905 --> 00:02:59,990
Speaker 0: a few years ago?

44
00:03:00,211 --> 00:03:00,918
Speaker 1: How many years ago?

45
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:06,050
Speaker 1: like three ish Alright, so I mean I played netrunner for X years.

46
00:03:06,211 --> 00:03:09,170
Speaker 1: You seem to just be playing overwatch for about the same number of years.

47
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:18,380
Speaker 0: The thing is overwatch for me is like tribes 2 and weapons factory in that if they were still playable I would probably still be playing.

48
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,767
Speaker 1: Well, I think the difference is is that You know netrunner requires significantly more effort to play.

49
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,676
Speaker 1: Yeah Right Whereas overwatch you can just play whenever.

50
00:03:26,776 --> 00:03:32,943
Speaker 1: if I could if there was a way to just played netrunner legit digital not the bullshit Digital and all the fun like you go to a ready room.

51
00:03:32,984 --> 00:03:33,970
Speaker 0: You're like, I want to play.

52
00:03:35,352 --> 00:03:36,656
Speaker 1: There was the fans made one.

53
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,780
Speaker 1: I just thought it was garbage.

54
00:03:37,981 --> 00:03:47,630
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, and they had a good one and that was I mean Yeah, we play tribes - if we get those executable files on the internet and run a complicated and I probably still be playing it.

55
00:03:47,892 --> 00:03:54,410
Speaker 0: So, you know, yep But the holy grail for me, this is not the holy grail for the game industry.

56
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,741
Speaker 0: This is old man rim and the kind of game.

57
00:03:56,762 --> 00:03:57,264
Speaker 0: He wants that.

58
00:03:57,304 --> 00:04:00,917
Speaker 0: No one else gives a shit about the genre I miss.

59
00:04:01,137 --> 00:04:08,460
Speaker 0: the most of games that I've liked over my life is First-person shooter team-based capture the flag.

60
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:16,260
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah like that that shit just gets me going in a way that is The flag IRL is great fun.

61
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,146
Speaker 1: That's why that was what inspired.

62
00:04:18,187 --> 00:04:21,137
Speaker 1: capture the flag in quay Look even like which is just faster.

63
00:04:21,218 --> 00:04:24,130
Speaker 1: capture the flag with rules that are properly enforced on guns.

64
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,437
Speaker 0: It's like even summer camp.

65
00:04:25,457 --> 00:04:31,304
Speaker 0: capture the flag with its vague ass rules Like you don't even have a paintball gun usually still is way fun.

66
00:04:31,444 --> 00:04:34,817
Speaker 1: I always do one thing, you know Is that real?

67
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:38,110
Speaker 1: capture the flag in real life, but you know a million variants?

68
00:04:38,551 --> 00:04:43,796
Speaker 1: But we always played some sort of variant that involved taking prisoners Of course and the what.

69
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:46,204
Speaker 1: the quake ones pretty much never have prisoners.

70
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,528
Speaker 1: you kill someone and they respawn.

71
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:56,609
Speaker 1: Yep Cool to have some sort of digital capture the flag FPS with the prisoner mechanic really Kill someone they're in a jail.

72
00:04:56,951 --> 00:05:00,789
Speaker 1: So now you're rushing the flag or do you rush the prison to bust everyone out?

73
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:12,229
Speaker 0: so because overwatch is based pretty heavily on games like action quake 2 like it's from that era and In the arcade part of overwatch, they keep making like fun game modes and they try stuff out.

74
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:19,588
Speaker 0: They keep tweaking and re-releasing different versions of capture the flag and when they first tried it didn't work that well.

75
00:05:19,608 --> 00:05:23,649
Speaker 0: for a lot of Reasons, I don't want to turn the whole show into this but they keep tweaking it.

76
00:05:24,512 --> 00:05:29,087
Speaker 0: They made a new tweak real recently and I think they're on to something.

77
00:05:29,107 --> 00:05:29,890
Speaker 1: What did they do?

78
00:05:31,134 --> 00:05:32,278
Speaker 0: They made it faster.

79
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,070
Speaker 1: Okay, like why don't they just make all overwatch faster?

80
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,740
Speaker 0: So all overwatch is already reasonably fast compared to most.

81
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:40,746
Speaker 0: FPS is like today quake too fast.

82
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:49,204
Speaker 0: Nothing's quite too fast it's not fast, but What they did with CTF blitz a new move that's in the arcade like right now.

83
00:05:49,786 --> 00:05:51,250
Speaker 0: They moved the flags closer together.

84
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,420
Speaker 0: Whoa, you're like way closer together.

85
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,794
Speaker 0: They put the flags now Where they own.

86
00:05:56,894 --> 00:05:58,720
Speaker 0: in the normal CTF they had previously.

87
00:05:59,262 --> 00:06:01,550
Speaker 0: the flags are kind of far apart in bases like tradition.

88
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,357
Speaker 1: So is it like an icy world kind of feel.

89
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,686
Speaker 0: it's more like an icy world kind of feels the.

90
00:06:05,706 --> 00:06:08,232
Speaker 1: really you're just like you just Throw it Bigger.

91
00:06:08,272 --> 00:06:09,076
Speaker 0: so the way it works is.

92
00:06:09,096 --> 00:06:12,070
Speaker 0: you know the old like to fort maps is like the base and the flag room.

93
00:06:12,652 --> 00:06:17,370
Speaker 0: They in regular CTF overwatch if the game is a tie the sudden death.

94
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:18,516
Speaker 0: It's the same map.

95
00:06:18,798 --> 00:06:20,688
Speaker 0: but the flags are like on the bridge.

96
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:23,529
Speaker 0: really Yeah, they're like on either side either side of the bridge fucking go.

97
00:06:24,374 --> 00:06:27,230
Speaker 0: They basically put the flags in a situation like that from the start.

98
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,763
Speaker 0: They make you get more captures when you die.

99
00:06:29,783 --> 00:06:33,281
Speaker 0: in normal overwatch There's a long respawn timer before you go back in.

100
00:06:33,322 --> 00:06:36,379
Speaker 1: instant respawn instant respawn But you respawn way in the back.

101
00:06:36,842 --> 00:06:42,590
Speaker 0: you respawn way in the back But you also move faster for like 10 seconds after your spawn.

102
00:06:42,991 --> 00:06:51,366
Speaker 0: So it's like old quake to style CTF where if you kill someone they are instantly Running straight back into the action from spawn screaming.

103
00:06:51,486 --> 00:06:54,250
Speaker 0: Okay They made a bunch of other changes.

104
00:06:54,330 --> 00:07:10,770
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna get into the details of but the end result of these tweaks is it's not perfect yet It still has flaws but from my like fairly like deep it Intuitive and mechanical Understanding of CTF games throughout their history.

105
00:07:11,433 --> 00:07:17,640
Speaker 0: This feels the closest to the feelings of old CTF FPS's from the quake one quake two era of anything.

106
00:07:17,721 --> 00:07:18,845
Speaker 0: anyone's made up to this point?

107
00:07:18,925 --> 00:07:20,130
Speaker 1: still not tribes to know.

108
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:24,423
Speaker 0: Of course, it's not tribes to try to choose the exact opposite flags as far apart.

109
00:07:24,443 --> 00:07:25,305
Speaker 0: Yeah possible.

110
00:07:25,365 --> 00:07:26,910
Speaker 1: All right, my where's the flag?

111
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,236
Speaker 1: Let me use my binoculars.

112
00:07:28,277 --> 00:07:29,282
Speaker 1: Yeah, I seize it.

113
00:07:29,402 --> 00:07:30,830
Speaker 0: Oh you want to get over to the enemy base?

114
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,036
Speaker 0: All right Get someone to spawn a truck.

115
00:07:33,176 --> 00:07:37,310
Speaker 1: you can everybody get into the truck and the game will be over by the time you get there.

116
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:38,482
Speaker 1: You can use your jetpack.

117
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:39,330
Speaker 1: That's pretty reasonable.

118
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:43,170
Speaker 1: Or you can fly in this fighter jet or take a bike.

119
00:07:43,411 --> 00:07:50,830
Speaker 0: my goal in tribes too often was to be a medium guy and Fucking make my way all the way over to the other side and make a tiny base.

120
00:07:51,251 --> 00:07:52,376
Speaker 1: It's like oh the enemies didn't.

121
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:53,702
Speaker 1: even the map is so big.

122
00:07:53,963 --> 00:07:55,770
Speaker 1: you didn't even see any enemy players.

123
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,964
Speaker 1: But you approach the enemy base and died because it has automated defenses.

124
00:07:59,366 --> 00:08:01,509
Speaker 1: Yeah suck They just shoot at you and you die.

125
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:09,588
Speaker 0: So in some other news Rocket League is doing the obvious thing that I was surprised they still support.

126
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:16,950
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I mean so Rocket League when it was new Did a great job of supporting all the platforms, right?

127
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,995
Speaker 1: It was pretty much on.

128
00:08:18,095 --> 00:08:27,250
Speaker 1: everything is on, you know, PS whatever Xbox PC Even Linux Mac switch is just on everything that could run Rocket League.

129
00:08:27,551 --> 00:08:32,787
Speaker 1: They're like, yes, we will be on every platform and they had crossplay as much as as much as they could.

130
00:08:33,068 --> 00:08:38,337
Speaker 1: they had crossplay I would be on PC and I'd open up Rocket League during the time I played it and lo and behold.

131
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:40,429
Speaker 1: Oh look this PlayStation people playing against me.

132
00:08:40,491 --> 00:08:42,033
Speaker 1: All right and it was.

133
00:08:42,232 --> 00:08:52,030
Speaker 0: it was like that from the start and I remember people even like making the point and I would kind of argue with Them that yeah, like there's a huge thriving community of Linux and Mac gamers.

134
00:08:52,151 --> 00:08:53,905
Speaker 1: I don't remember anyone saying that but I do.

135
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:58,684
Speaker 1: but you know There are people those people who do right play on Linux and Mac.

136
00:08:58,724 --> 00:09:00,429
Speaker 1: They don't have a lot of games to choose from.

137
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,222
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the games that they do play right?

138
00:09:04,282 --> 00:09:06,229
Speaker 1: They will be loud about right?

139
00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:11,680
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like oh my god a game is on my Linux I'm playing it like crazy and that's my game.

140
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,466
Speaker 1: and so think I'm all up in.

141
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:17,382
Speaker 1: so if you're a game developer You're the kind of guy who you play plays games on Linux or Mac.

142
00:09:17,684 --> 00:09:19,069
Speaker 1: You're the kind of person who's loud about it.

143
00:09:19,632 --> 00:09:29,110
Speaker 0: So if you are a game developer and it's a multiplayer game Theoretically by supporting Mac or Linux you'll capture like 90% of that audience, right?

144
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:40,958
Speaker 1: But because rocket League does have so many players that audience of Mac and Linux Rocket League players is still 0.3% of all active rocket League players 0.3%.

145
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,990
Speaker 1: so I didn't think it, you know is taking them a lot of effort to support those players.

146
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:50,050
Speaker 1: I cuz it looked to me like they had some sort of really good, you know cross-platform build process.

147
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:54,408
Speaker 0: You know, they were just you know, but they might have just papered over that with developer effort, right?

148
00:09:54,448 --> 00:09:54,830
Speaker 1: Who knows?

149
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,499
Speaker 1: But apparently it's taking more than zero effort.

150
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,196
Speaker 0: It's costing them more than zero money and it's worth a zero 0.3 right.

151
00:10:02,236 --> 00:10:02,357
Speaker 1: so?

152
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:05,590
Speaker 1: and it's not a game where you pay for subscriptions game where you buy it and you're done.

153
00:10:05,851 --> 00:10:08,480
Speaker 1: So they're not making any more money from that.

154
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,290
Speaker 1: It's like how many more people on Mac and Linux are buying rocket League.

155
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:11,913
Speaker 1: They already have it.

156
00:10:12,174 --> 00:10:12,476
Speaker 1: Yep.

157
00:10:12,496 --> 00:10:15,109
Speaker 1: So it's like yeah, we're gonna stop supporting it.

158
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:23,903
Speaker 1: So you can still play by yourself or locally with your existing rocket League patch Whatever patch that is or use like wine or boot camp or something.

159
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, a new wine version came out recently.

160
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:26,633
Speaker 1: It's like wine five.

161
00:10:26,653 --> 00:10:27,998
Speaker 0: Wow, and I have not.

162
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:29,002
Speaker 0: I have not used.

163
00:10:29,364 --> 00:10:32,495
Speaker 0: wine is not an emulator since 1990.

164
00:10:32,495 --> 00:10:34,067
Speaker 0: I don't remember when I last used it.

165
00:10:34,349 --> 00:10:38,982
Speaker 0: No 2002 I I was the wine expert at IBM.

166
00:10:39,162 --> 00:10:41,349
Speaker 0: The point is I made old shit working wine that.

167
00:10:42,671 --> 00:10:50,769
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're not gonna be able to play online once the patch goes out or if it went out already Yeah, I'm gonna have to play on Windows or on a PlayStation.

168
00:10:52,955 --> 00:10:58,347
Speaker 0: The only viable gaming platforms are phones slash mobiles of phones and tablets.

169
00:10:58,387 --> 00:10:59,650
Speaker 1: Hey, can you play rocket League in your phone?

170
00:10:59,991 --> 00:11:01,576
Speaker 0: I don't think I'm just like.

171
00:11:01,978 --> 00:11:03,523
Speaker 0: if you want to play games, it's.

172
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:05,410
Speaker 0: there's mobile which includes tablets.

173
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,443
Speaker 0: There's the switch, you know consoles switch PlayStation, whatever easy.

174
00:11:09,584 --> 00:11:10,889
Speaker 0: and there's Windows PCs.

175
00:11:11,975 --> 00:11:12,403
Speaker 0: That is it.

176
00:11:13,853 --> 00:11:15,228
Speaker 0: So, uh some other news.

177
00:11:16,971 --> 00:11:22,490
Speaker 0: Pokemon home is not actually technically replacing Pokemon Bank or at least not yet.

178
00:11:22,912 --> 00:11:23,837
Speaker 0: but they announced it.

179
00:11:23,877 --> 00:11:38,190
Speaker 0: they announced all the deal with it and It's interesting because I see like the Twitter Discussion I see about this is like one-third people are like, yes I have a home for all my Pokemon one third of people who were like, but it cost so much money.

180
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,917
Speaker 0: This is bullshit nonsense.

181
00:11:39,957 --> 00:11:41,503
Speaker 1: They charge money from Pokemon Bank.

182
00:11:41,603 --> 00:11:42,909
Speaker 1: Also how do I actually?

183
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:45,882
Speaker 1: yeah I'd only paid for Pokemon Bank at the start.

184
00:11:46,023 --> 00:11:47,510
Speaker 1: It's I'm down and that was it.

185
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,461
Speaker 1: So I guess I got the free like whatever the period was.

186
00:11:50,481 --> 00:11:52,889
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then I never paid for it again.

187
00:11:53,652 --> 00:11:58,149
Speaker 1: But I have a Pokemon Bank full of spirit tombs somewhere if I can possibly access it.

188
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:06,414
Speaker 0: So Pokemon Bank was basically the old way to get Pokemon from various Pokemon games into a place that you could then get them Forward right.

189
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,970
Speaker 1: So the original Pokemon the very first Pokemon Gameboy cartridge.

190
00:12:10,131 --> 00:12:16,618
Speaker 1: You could move your Pokemon from the original Pokemon red blue Right into Pokemon gold silver.

191
00:12:16,638 --> 00:12:38,570
Speaker 1: and then I don't there was a cut off at some point but for quite a while they had ways for you to use link cables or DS's with you know a GBA cartridge and a DS cartridge and there were ways to Bringing your Pokemon up and up and up, but there was a cutoff and then they started again.

192
00:12:39,112 --> 00:12:50,135
Speaker 0: And I don't think there was a second cut off until the newest switch game Which I believe you can transfer Pokemon from a third gen game to a fourth gen game provided you own an original Ds or DS light.

193
00:12:50,195 --> 00:12:50,617
Speaker 0: All right.

194
00:12:50,758 --> 00:12:52,827
Speaker 0: Yeah, I there seems like there were.

195
00:12:52,868 --> 00:12:53,350
Speaker 1: there were a few.

196
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:59,650
Speaker 1: I think there was a point where you couldn't transfer up anymore, but there was a surprising support for transferring your Pokemon.

197
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:04,070
Speaker 0: You know, you're transferring Pokemon from Gameboy Advance to modern games.

198
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:12,434
Speaker 0: Yeah, I feel like the goal was to get it to the minimum Pokemon game that could connect to Bank And then you were golden, right?

199
00:13:12,454 --> 00:13:14,981
Speaker 1: Yeah Bank was not Pokemon gold golden.

200
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:20,658
Speaker 1: Just golden Bank was it until the switch came out and So now they're gonna have Pokemon home.

201
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:21,180
Speaker 0: Yep.

202
00:13:21,381 --> 00:13:23,728
Speaker 1: It's just Pokemon Bank on the switch.

203
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:37,290
Speaker 0: now It seems like people who play Pokemon on the switch to use all the online features Or you got to pay for the Pokemon stuff Nintendo online and on top of this they're actually 16 pay 16 bucks a year for Pokemon home.

204
00:13:37,471 --> 00:13:46,030
Speaker 0: So that comes out like 40 bucks a year and it still limits you to 6000 Pokemon which when I looked at this, that's all I need to you folks that is plenty.

205
00:13:46,391 --> 00:13:53,369
Speaker 0: But according to a third of the people I see on Twitter that is to paraphrase Bullshit, that is harmful to me as a person.

206
00:13:54,294 --> 00:13:56,865
Speaker 1: If you're a pokémaniac, you got more than 6,000 Pokemon.

207
00:13:56,906 --> 00:14:06,750
Speaker 0: if you're a pokémaniac I feel like I mean that's already the premium plan If you need more than 6,000 Pokemon, you need help or Nintendo could offer you a like Platinum plan.

208
00:14:08,232 --> 00:14:11,170
Speaker 1: Nintendo does have a history of increasing the numbers over time.

209
00:14:11,352 --> 00:14:25,127
Speaker 1: Yeah example in Mario maker They always have a limit on how many levels you can upload because at the start there's so many players Right and everyone's uploading levels like crazy, but then as players drop off the game They're like, okay anyone who's still playing Mario maker will increase your level.

210
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:25,710
Speaker 1: upload limit.

211
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,838
Speaker 1: Yeah, they've done it already like two or three times.

212
00:14:28,319 --> 00:14:29,805
Speaker 1: So I feel like for Pokemon home.

213
00:14:29,845 --> 00:14:31,230
Speaker 1: It's gonna be like, okay 6,000.

214
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,837
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right, who's still playing Pokemon?

215
00:14:32,837 --> 00:14:33,439
Speaker 1: 10,000?

216
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,570
Speaker 1: All right, who's still playing 20,000?

217
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:42,130
Speaker 0: So it looks like if you don't pay you can't take Pokemon from Pokemon Bank and even put them in here.

218
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:45,049
Speaker 0: Ah, and you can have up to 30 Pokemon in their total.

219
00:14:45,531 --> 00:14:46,273
Speaker 0: You can't use any.

220
00:14:46,293 --> 00:14:53,136
Speaker 1: but if you're not if you're not transferring Pokemon from old Pokemon to new What does Pokemon home even do?

221
00:14:53,196 --> 00:14:57,892
Speaker 0: trading with other people who play the switch Pokemon is basically you can just do that with the switch Pokemon.

222
00:14:57,932 --> 00:14:58,957
Speaker 1: why do you need Pokemon home?

223
00:14:59,057 --> 00:15:01,850
Speaker 0: You can't do like the wonder trade that's built into home.

224
00:15:02,191 --> 00:15:08,610
Speaker 0: Okay, they may have rooms or you can just like set up a little carpet and be like I got a Pikachu if anyone wants It okay.

225
00:15:09,694 --> 00:15:12,174
Speaker 0: And they got this judge function Which you won't get to use.

226
00:15:12,435 --> 00:15:14,704
Speaker 0: that will tell you how strong the Pokemon is.

227
00:15:14,764 --> 00:15:18,681
Speaker 0: They added a bunch of features that You need if you're Pokemon, yeah, you.

228
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:24,525
Speaker 0: basically if you're serious about Pokemon I feel like what you need to do is pay for Pokemon premium.

229
00:15:24,565 --> 00:15:25,690
Speaker 0: paper Pokemon on premium.

230
00:15:26,732 --> 00:15:27,697
Speaker 0: Use the free month.

231
00:15:27,717 --> 00:15:30,530
Speaker 0: They're giving everyone in Pokemon Bank to use Bank.

232
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,649
Speaker 0: If you haven't used it before they're gonna give everyone a month free on Pokemon Bank.

233
00:15:34,111 --> 00:15:36,682
Speaker 0: Get every Pokemon you got in the world into Bank.

234
00:15:36,943 --> 00:15:38,750
Speaker 0: get every Pokemon and Bank into home.

235
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:46,710
Speaker 0: Cancel Bank home forever and then someday they'll be like, I don't know Pokemon But what about it Pokemon glue factor and you move them in?

236
00:15:47,231 --> 00:15:51,385
Speaker 1: So the new Pokemon Pokemon sword shield doesn't support every Pokemon ever.

237
00:15:51,405 --> 00:15:52,810
Speaker 0: so you can put them all.

238
00:15:53,010 --> 00:16:00,470
Speaker 1: Pokemon Bank supports as far as I'm aware every Pokemon every Pokemon except for the ones that are new in sword shield.

239
00:16:00,631 --> 00:16:02,179
Speaker 0: Yep, so, I don't know if you could.

240
00:16:02,219 --> 00:16:04,130
Speaker 0: can you transfer like a missing no or a broken boy?

241
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:08,530
Speaker 1: There's a Pokemon say my guy Spiritomb who's not in Pokemon sword shield is right.

242
00:16:08,671 --> 00:16:14,650
Speaker 1: You can hang on to him until a future Pokemon supports it I can put him in Pokemon home, even though Pokemon sword shield does not support spirit.

243
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,109
Speaker 0: Yep, it just means you can't put him into sword shield.

244
00:16:18,031 --> 00:16:18,473
Speaker 1: Aha, but I can.

245
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:23,730
Speaker 1: I can save my spiritomb from from the the grave of Pokemon Bank after it gets robbed.

246
00:16:24,032 --> 00:16:28,117
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically if they're still in there Yeah transfers their own way true.

247
00:16:28,137 --> 00:16:30,630
Speaker 0: You can read all the details cuz we're not gonna.

248
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:34,370
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna explain to you exactly how this works cuz it's not something I'll use.

249
00:16:34,531 --> 00:16:36,377
Speaker 0: I don't ever transfer Pokemon between games.

250
00:16:36,437 --> 00:16:38,284
Speaker 1: I've done it in my past.

251
00:16:38,344 --> 00:16:38,946
Speaker 0: I have done it.

252
00:16:39,006 --> 00:16:40,090
Speaker 0: I will never do it in the future.

253
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,194
Speaker 1: I don't think it's gonna happen.

254
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:41,756
Speaker 0: I'll just buy.

255
00:16:41,796 --> 00:16:42,920
Speaker 0: just play new Pokemon games.

256
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:43,904
Speaker 0: Like what's that?

257
00:16:44,085 --> 00:16:44,968
Speaker 0: What's that Pokemon?

258
00:16:44,988 --> 00:16:45,369
Speaker 0: Let's go.

259
00:16:46,511 --> 00:16:49,382
Speaker 1: I might go and just look to see how it see how it does.

260
00:16:49,402 --> 00:16:51,430
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, you can poke at it for free.

261
00:16:51,671 --> 00:16:56,096
Speaker 1: Yeah, I might just poke it when I get home like get my Brush the dust off my D.

262
00:16:56,136 --> 00:16:57,903
Speaker 0: Yeah, plus you'll get a moment there.

263
00:16:58,044 --> 00:16:59,450
Speaker 0: you get a month free of Bank.

264
00:16:59,892 --> 00:17:00,053
Speaker 0: What?

265
00:17:00,254 --> 00:17:05,560
Speaker 0: the one thing that I find interesting what I don't know what Nintendo will do Sam I do get a month free of Bank just no matter what.

266
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,069
Speaker 1: or do you get a month free of Bank if you pay for?

267
00:17:07,471 --> 00:17:14,869
Speaker 0: Not sure, okay, but I wonder say I put 6,000 Pokemon in Pokemon home and I'm paying this money now, right?

268
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:17,805
Speaker 0: If I stop paying to my Pokemon, I'll die.

269
00:17:17,845 --> 00:17:18,490
Speaker 0: just is gone.

270
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:19,573
Speaker 1: I'm well gonna find out.

271
00:17:19,613 --> 00:17:21,839
Speaker 1: cuz I stopped paying for bang cuz Nintendo.

272
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:32,330
Speaker 0: This is this is one of those ways like with certain unnamed MMORPGs you can basically extort someone into paying for this thing forever.

273
00:17:32,772 --> 00:17:36,189
Speaker 0: So their Pokemon don't disappear even if they don't actually play Pokemon anymore.

274
00:17:37,631 --> 00:17:40,661
Speaker 0: In some other news we haven't actually talked about this.

275
00:17:40,741 --> 00:17:45,997
Speaker 0: it's been the news for a while, but half-life Not three is coming out, right?

276
00:17:46,017 --> 00:17:50,250
Speaker 0: So they're making a game that is not half-life 3, but it's also half-life 3.

277
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,415
Speaker 0: It's called half-life Alex.

278
00:17:51,636 --> 00:17:54,710
Speaker 1: I guess you play as Alex the other character from half-life 2.

279
00:17:54,710 --> 00:18:00,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, I decide the the sidekick girl and it's a VR only game and it looks great.

280
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:06,982
Speaker 0: They're trying to push their VRs their steam valve VRs Yep, which not to the V the way the VR landscape right now is.

281
00:18:07,023 --> 00:18:12,930
Speaker 0: basically there's the normal VR Which is basically like the oculus stuff like that kind of thing.

282
00:18:15,151 --> 00:18:21,766
Speaker 0: Basically Valve is going with their index, which is like the high-end VR, but it's not really.

283
00:18:21,786 --> 00:18:23,010
Speaker 0: I don't think it's materially better.

284
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:32,036
Speaker 0: I don't think there are significant experiences you can make with this upper-end VR that you can't make with like an oculus quest oculus Like rift oculus s type thing.

285
00:18:32,337 --> 00:18:36,030
Speaker 1: I guess it's gonna be like prequel to half-life 2 like what was she up to before?

286
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,496
Speaker 0: Gordon Friedman was on yeah Which this is sort of a divide.

287
00:18:39,516 --> 00:18:43,528
Speaker 0: we even saw in the Ignites forum where it seems like there are some people who?

288
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:49,770
Speaker 0: Primarily want a more half-life content because they care about like the lore and the proper right.

289
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:50,172
Speaker 1: So we'll see.

290
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:50,434
Speaker 1: it's like.

291
00:18:50,454 --> 00:18:53,110
Speaker 1: I don't care about the lore of half-life at all.

292
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,778
Speaker 1: No, it's like but like.

293
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:56,366
Speaker 1: what was the deal with the g-man?

294
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:57,130
Speaker 1: I don't give a shit, right?

295
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:02,470
Speaker 1: But the point is half-life 2 episode 2 whatever ended on a crazy cliffhanger.

296
00:19:02,631 --> 00:19:03,960
Speaker 0: But I already don't care like.

297
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,450
Speaker 0: I just don't care about what happens.

298
00:19:05,671 --> 00:19:12,059
Speaker 0: I just want more games that do the mechanical type of cinematic gameplay Storytelling that half-life games do.

299
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,208
Speaker 0: the proper nouns mean nothing to me at this point.

300
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:36,587
Speaker 1: Yep but also It's interesting that valve is doing this right and not half-life 3 When valve has had like so many pretty much all their recent attempts since half-life 2 ended to make games besides dota 2 No, and besides counter-strike, but even sort of counter-strike and even worse.

301
00:19:36,648 --> 00:19:45,821
Speaker 0: based on my Like the people who have left valve over the years and talked about what it's like to work there I don't feel like valve is able to retain good game design.

302
00:19:45,921 --> 00:19:47,987
Speaker 1: No, so it's like their artifact thing.

303
00:19:48,028 --> 00:19:48,810
Speaker 1: Remember that fiasco?

304
00:19:49,532 --> 00:19:51,519
Speaker 1: So that game hasn't been updated in a year.

305
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:52,000
Speaker 1: right?

306
00:19:52,281 --> 00:20:00,350
Speaker 1: counter-strike for all the fact that it's still alive has Tons of fiascoes going on with gambling like like even the worst possible game we talk about like.

307
00:20:00,514 --> 00:20:06,890
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah All these other loot box games is children gambling like counter-strike is even more literal gambling.

308
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,984
Speaker 0: But also valve didn't make the original counter-strike.

309
00:20:10,005 --> 00:20:11,110
Speaker 0: They bought it, right?

310
00:20:12,112 --> 00:20:13,077
Speaker 1: You know, they got their dota.

311
00:20:13,097 --> 00:20:17,313
Speaker 1: they got their you know, their dota Underlords whatever.

312
00:20:17,334 --> 00:20:19,563
Speaker 1: I don't know if anyone's playing that still right there.

313
00:20:19,723 --> 00:20:21,410
Speaker 1: They're their auto chess version.

314
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,182
Speaker 1: It seems like the League of Legends auto chess version has become the champion.

315
00:20:25,804 --> 00:20:29,167
Speaker 1: League of Legends also has a new card game That seems like is that gonna beat?

316
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:36,334
Speaker 1: Hearthstone and you know, we obviously artifact isn't in the in the race anymore EBD, right.

317
00:20:36,656 --> 00:20:39,450
Speaker 1: It seems like the League of Legends or people are making all that riot.

318
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:45,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there's some controversies about riot that have escalated recently, but I'm just talking about in terms of success.

319
00:20:45,493 --> 00:20:47,930
Speaker 1: They seem to be making these successful.

320
00:20:48,674 --> 00:20:49,450
Speaker 1: PC games.

321
00:20:52,571 --> 00:20:56,522
Speaker 1: Valve and Blizzard have fallen off and riot has taken their.

322
00:20:56,602 --> 00:21:05,872
Speaker 1: they used to have just one game League of Legends and now that they Made an auto chess and they made a card game Yeah, and it seems like they're branching out and being like, alright, we're the biggest game in town We can.

323
00:21:05,953 --> 00:21:08,289
Speaker 1: you know valve is weak, you know Blizzard is weak.

324
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:10,277
Speaker 1: I guess attack while they're down.

325
00:21:10,377 --> 00:21:17,750
Speaker 0: what I trust about this game if nothing else is that Based it valve does not tend to release games like this.

326
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:24,699
Speaker 0: Like they're not gonna risk fucking up their half-life franchise because half-life 3 They only risked it like several times.

327
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,393
Speaker 0: Well, I mean they made it well, they made half-life 1. that was a risk And it paid out.

328
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:30,219
Speaker 0: they made half-life 2. that was a risk.

329
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:30,922
Speaker 0: that it paid out.

330
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:32,648
Speaker 0: The portal is adjacent.

331
00:21:32,748 --> 00:21:38,281
Speaker 0: that paid out Half-life 3. if they fuck it up like that kind of ends the franchise.

332
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,488
Speaker 1: the fortress 2 that you're left for deads.

333
00:21:40,548 --> 00:21:44,475
Speaker 1: Yeah That's well so but I did.

334
00:21:44,735 --> 00:21:49,112
Speaker 0: but I feel like the fact that they're making a half-life game means that They're.

335
00:21:49,633 --> 00:22:05,422
Speaker 0: I feel like they're gonna give it their all and I feel like this game is has the potential to be one of the few games that will take the fullest advantage of the current capabilities of Consumer accessible home VR and make one of the best possible games you can make.

336
00:22:05,883 --> 00:22:10,061
Speaker 1: I think it's gonna be a game that You don't know shit about VR.

337
00:22:10,082 --> 00:22:11,230
Speaker 0: So I'm really curious what you think.

338
00:22:11,714 --> 00:22:13,730
Speaker 1: I think it's obviously it's gonna be FPS, right?

339
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:25,178
Speaker 1: They're gonna put lots of like the way that half-life 2 had all like those physics Puzzles gonna be a lot of like hand manipulation puzzles are gonna have Like, you know VR stuff.

340
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:28,530
Speaker 1: that's you know, sort of scooby-dooed in to the to the half-life world.

341
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:32,268
Speaker 0: Well, I think it'll be mostly that you'll be in a room figure deal with the room move on.

342
00:22:32,288 --> 00:22:33,052
Speaker 1: Yep It's good.

343
00:22:33,072 --> 00:22:36,550
Speaker 0: That's how the game probably also some rail shooter type elements.

344
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:39,658
Speaker 1: It's basically that's what's gonna be like which I'm into.

345
00:22:39,678 --> 00:22:40,400
Speaker 0: I also don't.

346
00:22:40,741 --> 00:22:44,050
Speaker 1: I'm also guessing that this game will not be long.

347
00:22:44,472 --> 00:22:47,190
Speaker 1: Oh, no, that's that's like one and two were long.

348
00:22:47,611 --> 00:22:52,690
Speaker 1: I think it will be at most the length of one of those half-life episode have like two episodes.

349
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, which will be the longest it could possibly be.

350
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,824
Speaker 0: That's the right.

351
00:22:55,844 --> 00:22:57,030
Speaker 0: a lot of people in our game.

352
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:01,530
Speaker 1: I think a lot of people get this play it be done with it and then put their VR back in the closet.

353
00:23:01,711 --> 00:23:09,921
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, it'll be like the Rick and Morty game, which is also one of these like surprisingly One of the best VR experiences anyone's ever made a lot of competition.

354
00:23:10,282 --> 00:23:15,958
Speaker 0: There's there's about 12 like great VR experiences Available for consumers that you can just buy.

355
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:18,950
Speaker 0: it's still a hobbyist like so it's like an Atari Jaguar.

356
00:23:19,151 --> 00:23:22,242
Speaker 0: It's edging into the like I said the expanded market.

357
00:23:22,323 --> 00:23:23,949
Speaker 0: I think that's gonna grow rapidly.

358
00:23:23,989 --> 00:23:24,230
Speaker 0: still.

359
00:23:24,551 --> 00:23:27,018
Speaker 0: There's a lot of good stuff in pipelines of various company.

360
00:23:27,078 --> 00:23:28,863
Speaker 1: It's gonna be more like an Atari Jaguar.

361
00:23:29,405 --> 00:23:32,982
Speaker 0: see I disagree strongly But you've never even done modern VR's.

362
00:23:33,022 --> 00:23:34,150
Speaker 0: you have no idea what it's like.

363
00:23:34,995 --> 00:23:41,045
Speaker 0: You can take Scott's opinion with the Ignorant grain of salt that you need to but I'll play this game.

364
00:23:41,366 --> 00:23:42,310
Speaker 0: Scott could play this game.

365
00:23:42,471 --> 00:23:43,456
Speaker 0: I own two VR headsets.

366
00:23:43,476 --> 00:23:45,808
Speaker 0: Scott could just try this game, but I'll probably refuse to.

367
00:23:46,089 --> 00:23:50,990
Speaker 0: thus He won't even be able to talk about it, but I think I'll be fine without playing this game.

368
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:51,957
Speaker 1: There's a lot of other games.

369
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:53,126
Speaker 1: I also have not played.

370
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:54,932
Speaker 0: I know I Shockingly like.

371
00:23:54,953 --> 00:23:58,084
Speaker 0: of all those games overwatch is the one you'd probably like the most.

372
00:23:58,164 --> 00:23:59,690
Speaker 1: yeah, no, I don't play that.

373
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:00,054
Speaker 0: Why not?

374
00:24:00,296 --> 00:24:01,347
Speaker 1: why would I play that game?

375
00:24:02,112 --> 00:24:02,473
Speaker 0: So what?

376
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:03,798
Speaker 0: what kind of game do you want?

00:24:06,287 --> 00:24:07,010
Speaker 0: what game would make you?

380
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,343
Speaker 0: Excited I don't feel like you get a game about games anymore.

381
00:24:09,363 --> 00:24:12,383
Speaker 1: I get excited about a game That is nothing like any previous game.

382
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,475
Speaker 1: I don't want to see a game That's just more of a same old.

383
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:17,850
Speaker 0: You know you just don't want more tribes to know there's what previous game.

384
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:18,678
Speaker 1: There's no other game.

385
00:24:18,698 --> 00:24:19,687
Speaker 1: That's tribes to right now.

386
00:24:21,051 --> 00:24:25,145
Speaker 0: Okay, but you've played tribes - so why just play a better play tribe super.

387
00:24:25,186 --> 00:24:32,949
Speaker 1: such a brief moment in time You go look tribes - existed for mere months, and I've been alive for many years.

388
00:24:33,531 --> 00:24:37,483
Speaker 0: We played it for about a year and a half before it completely died barely.

389
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:41,957
Speaker 1: it came out late freshman year and Died early sophomore year.

390
00:24:42,118 --> 00:24:43,183
Speaker 0: No died a late soft.

391
00:24:43,223 --> 00:24:44,730
Speaker 0: We played it a lot in the old apartment.

392
00:24:44,851 --> 00:24:50,810
Speaker 0: I did not go look at the timeline Yeah, but I know how much I played it tribes - did not live long, but it was still there.

393
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,748
Speaker 0: We I also kept playing it long after you gave up.

394
00:24:54,631 --> 00:24:55,938
Speaker 1: It did not live long.

395
00:24:55,978 --> 00:25:01,630
Speaker 1: it was gone by the time in some So he couldn't play it anymore before we get on to reviewing some games.

396
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:13,950
Speaker 0: so there's a lot going on in the eSports and straight eSports streaming and Like streamer streaming markets out there like the twitch youtube gaming all that stuff.

397
00:25:14,392 --> 00:25:18,249
Speaker 0: There's way too much to talk about but the one I think we need to talk about that's the biggest news.

398
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:26,134
Speaker 0: All the Activision Blizzard things the Overwatch League Call of Duty League Hearthstone everything is Leaving twitch.

399
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:29,890
Speaker 1: now that the contracts up YouTube exclusive, and if they had a contract with - it.

400
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's that there was a exclusive okay?

401
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,454
Speaker 1: But the point is right.

402
00:25:33,655 --> 00:25:36,887
Speaker 0: you get the impression that they were just waiting for this contract to expire.

403
00:25:36,927 --> 00:25:43,070
Speaker 1: well the point is You know the streaming world started out where it was all about the platform.

404
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:48,210
Speaker 0: It's pretty much spent 90 million dollars for the exclusive rights to the first two seasons of overwatch.

405
00:25:48,571 --> 00:25:51,944
Speaker 1: Well, it was pretty much just twitch right in the in the early days.

406
00:25:52,004 --> 00:25:52,607
Speaker 1: everyone right.

407
00:25:52,647 --> 00:26:01,740
Speaker 1: there was no other competition and when competition appeared in the form of YouTube At YouTube it's pretty much YouTube Facebook, and then mixer came.

408
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,164
Speaker 1: you know Microsoft right.

409
00:26:03,184 --> 00:26:14,949
Speaker 1: so all the big boys you got Amazon Google Microsoft and Facebook all four of those are in the streaming video game Competition realm and twitch was just the king because it was the oldest and everyone was there.

410
00:26:15,091 --> 00:26:25,043
Speaker 1: Yeah So it in the earliest days everyone who all the content makers the streamers whether you were pro or just some kid in your house Where you got to be on twitch because that's where the people were.

411
00:26:25,203 --> 00:26:25,665
Speaker 1: yep, right.

412
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:26,750
Speaker 1: so everyone went to twitch.

413
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:33,570
Speaker 1: But now ninja right for whatever you got to say about the dude ninja and whatever lot of fans.

414
00:26:34,733 --> 00:26:39,548
Speaker 1: He signed that deal with mixer right to leave twitch and all accounts are right.

415
00:26:39,568 --> 00:26:43,737
Speaker 0: that like Decimated the viewership on twitch across the board.

416
00:26:43,777 --> 00:26:47,214
Speaker 1: basically people who were on Twitch right.

417
00:26:47,495 --> 00:26:50,826
Speaker 1: some of them stayed watching twitch, but went to watch other people.

418
00:26:51,207 --> 00:26:52,190
Speaker 1: some of them followed.

419
00:26:52,371 --> 00:26:53,396
Speaker 1: They were just ninja fans.

420
00:26:53,416 --> 00:26:54,863
Speaker 1: They didn't care where ninja was.

421
00:26:54,883 --> 00:26:56,230
Speaker 1: they were such ninja fans.

422
00:26:56,291 --> 00:26:57,509
Speaker 1: They follow him wherever he goes.

423
00:26:57,911 --> 00:26:59,537
Speaker 1: So that's why mixer was.

424
00:26:59,658 --> 00:27:02,208
Speaker 1: Microsoft was willing to make an exclusive deal with Pam.

425
00:27:02,228 --> 00:27:02,730
Speaker 1: a lot of money.

426
00:27:03,192 --> 00:27:04,703
Speaker 1: Get those people to go to mixer.

427
00:27:04,763 --> 00:27:05,790
Speaker 1: so on mixer.

428
00:27:06,151 --> 00:27:11,950
Speaker 1: He has less eyeballs than he had on twitch, but he's got a bunch of you know luxury and his life is easier.

429
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:16,509
Speaker 1: He doesn't have to stream like crazy and get subs because he's got the money from the exclusive deal.

430
00:27:17,151 --> 00:27:25,716
Speaker 1: Right and that seems to be why a lot of the individual streamers have you know sign these deals so easily because it's like ah I don't have to beg for subs.

431
00:27:25,736 --> 00:27:27,181
Speaker 1: You know I can live off this.

432
00:27:27,221 --> 00:27:28,907
Speaker 1: you know regular safe money.

433
00:27:28,927 --> 00:27:35,616
Speaker 1: I'm secure Right you know I don't have to have such a grueling streaming schedule and play games I don't want to play.

434
00:27:35,677 --> 00:27:39,049
Speaker 1: their life is more comfortable right It's a really good deal for them.

435
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,008
Speaker 1: So you can't blame them.

436
00:27:40,351 --> 00:27:48,558
Speaker 1: But that when ninja did it and it worked out that opened the floodgates and made people realize aha This is the point at which it's no longer.

437
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:52,690
Speaker 1: the platform owns the eyeballs and you the con talent.

438
00:27:53,312 --> 00:27:56,742
Speaker 1: Right and the talent was going to where the eyeballs were to try to.

439
00:27:56,762 --> 00:27:58,968
Speaker 1: you know fight over the eyeball pie.

440
00:27:59,048 --> 00:27:59,610
Speaker 1: that twitch was.

441
00:28:00,252 --> 00:28:02,940
Speaker 1: Now it's people are there to see.

442
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:13,110
Speaker 1: you know the show right whoever it is whether it's overwatch league or ninja or someone else and They'll just watch whatever channel they happen to be on it.

443
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:18,008
Speaker 1: Yeah, you saw the same thing with like Netflix like everyone has Netflix so everyone had to get the show on Netflix.

444
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:20,796
Speaker 1: now There's other things to go to.

445
00:28:21,077 --> 00:28:25,150
Speaker 1: yeah, so everyone goes to where the show they want to watch is they don't know one.

446
00:28:25,311 --> 00:28:28,689
Speaker 1: There's no one who's like a Netflix fanboy who's like Netflix?

447
00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:32,010
Speaker 1: good You know the same way that like they're super Nintendo agenda seems like though.

448
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:42,130
Speaker 0: There's two things going on here because overwatch league also It seems like one of the reasons they wanted to switch was that twitch only has about 15 million active users.

449
00:28:42,231 --> 00:28:48,084
Speaker 0: like that's the kind of the the Addressable audience of twitch today and YouTube has about 200 million.

450
00:28:48,244 --> 00:28:49,810
Speaker 1: Well, that's you're counting all of YouTube.

451
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:55,357
Speaker 1: You know, if you count only people on YouTube who watch Streaming games on YouTube.

452
00:28:55,537 --> 00:28:56,660
Speaker 1: Yes much much much.

453
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:56,901
Speaker 0: Yes.

454
00:28:56,961 --> 00:29:02,000
Speaker 0: That's why I said addressable market not active market or industry stuff.

455
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:07,685
Speaker 0: so I Suspect that Blizzard Activision Blizzard because it's not just the Blizzard games.

456
00:29:07,725 --> 00:29:08,247
Speaker 0: It's like all that.

457
00:29:08,287 --> 00:29:09,270
Speaker 0: Call of Duty is part of this.

458
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:15,186
Speaker 0: They want to have their eSports on a broader more mass-market platform.

459
00:29:15,688 --> 00:29:22,330
Speaker 0: That's more like Recommendations for it and the algorithms will hit like regular old sports fans, right?

460
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:25,702
Speaker 1: But here's the thing is that you know, you would think it seems obvious right.

461
00:29:25,883 --> 00:29:29,478
Speaker 1: almost everyone on Twitch has a YouTube channel Yeah, and they post their clips to you.

462
00:29:29,558 --> 00:29:31,830
Speaker 0: Like I don't watch a DDQ anywhere but YouTube.

463
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:40,157
Speaker 1: I just wait for the VODs on just about every twitch streamer, you know takes clips and puts them on YouTube and people who are some people only follow.

464
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:42,244
Speaker 1: they'll follow a streamer like ninja on like.

465
00:29:42,284 --> 00:29:44,772
Speaker 1: I don't think ninja has stuff on YouTube anymore if Did.

466
00:29:44,892 --> 00:29:49,728
Speaker 1: but take for example, well Andy the the link to the past randomizer.

467
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,133
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, right He's got.

468
00:29:51,515 --> 00:29:52,258
Speaker 1: Andy has a YouTube.

469
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:53,021
Speaker 1: All right, and they're.

470
00:29:53,162 --> 00:29:55,110
Speaker 1: they actually make jokes in like the twitch chat.

471
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:59,669
Speaker 1: They'd be like, oh this twitch they'll go in the twitch chat and be like, is that YouTube Andy?

472
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:04,830
Speaker 1: And they'll be like twitch Andy right and there's people though who like only watch him on YouTube.

473
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, only watch him on Twitch care about him so much.

474
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:18,410
Speaker 1: They follow him on both right and the thinking is there's so many people Watch cuz like you're a streamer You're making pretty much just as much money from people watching your clips on YouTube as you are from your twitch subs.

475
00:30:18,531 --> 00:30:20,270
Speaker 1: Right sort of an even deal maybe.

476
00:30:21,995 --> 00:30:26,510
Speaker 0: And I think it's a lot easier to make money on YouTube because of the ad stuff that I don't want to get into right now.

477
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:27,401
Speaker 1: Could be who knows?

478
00:30:27,462 --> 00:30:31,639
Speaker 1: Well, there's Streamer as your as your profession.

479
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,890
Speaker 1: you you want both of those income streams.

480
00:30:34,091 --> 00:30:38,790
Speaker 1: You want your twitch streamers and your subs and you want your YouTube clip, you know monies also, right?

481
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:50,210
Speaker 1: And the thing is you think be obvious that you'd be able to translate that Audience of people who watch clips of streamers on YouTube to then click on like a related thing.

482
00:30:50,412 --> 00:30:51,569
Speaker 1: You know you pop up on the side.

483
00:30:51,991 --> 00:30:59,415
Speaker 1: You're watching a clip of someone who streamed yesterday and their YouTube streamer and there's like a thing like hey They're live now bro.

484
00:30:59,455 --> 00:31:00,058
Speaker 1: Click here.

485
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:02,267
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you think that's so obvious.

486
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:05,280
Speaker 1: it would work But it doesn't seem like it has worked.

487
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:09,716
Speaker 1: not a lot of people watch live Streaming games on YouTube.

488
00:31:09,736 --> 00:31:11,603
Speaker 1: It's way smaller than it's.

489
00:31:11,783 --> 00:31:13,710
Speaker 1: feels like it's smaller than I don't have numbers.

490
00:31:13,951 --> 00:31:18,165
Speaker 1: Well, it feels way smaller than even like the Facebook gaming in the mixer.

491
00:31:18,205 --> 00:31:19,670
Speaker 1: It feels like YouTube's in last place.

492
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,734
Speaker 0: So there's even more here.

493
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:22,701
Speaker 0: There's an area where twitch just cannot compete.

494
00:31:23,343 --> 00:31:24,307
Speaker 0: part of the move.

495
00:31:24,769 --> 00:31:25,130
Speaker 0: Is that?

496
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:35,708
Speaker 0: Activision Blizzard is also gonna host all the shit for the live streaming and the tournaments and the eSports in the Google Cloud and the Google Cloud will drive the streaming through YouTube.

497
00:31:36,572 --> 00:31:38,197
Speaker 0: Twitch does not have a cloud platform.

498
00:31:38,217 --> 00:31:39,321
Speaker 0: You can host your infrastructure.

499
00:31:39,341 --> 00:31:39,782
Speaker 0: They do.

500
00:31:39,943 --> 00:31:41,287
Speaker 1: It's Amazon Web Services.

501
00:31:41,408 --> 00:31:43,333
Speaker 0: Yeah It's not this.

502
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:45,519
Speaker 0: it's not quite the same integration level.

503
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:56,069
Speaker 0: Google appears to be providing services on top of that Like they're doing something here and they're integrating the ad network and AI in a way that might be ominous.

504
00:31:57,311 --> 00:31:58,234
Speaker 0: Now I'm reading the article.

505
00:31:58,454 --> 00:32:01,744
Speaker 0: in addition Blizzard plans to use Google AI for her ads.

506
00:32:01,965 --> 00:32:02,225
Speaker 0: quote.

507
00:32:02,526 --> 00:32:12,795
Speaker 0: players will have the optimal Personalized interactions as Activision Blizzard contacting can tap into Google cloud in AI tools to offer curated recommendations for in-game offers and Differentiated gaming.

508
00:32:12,855 --> 00:32:19,157
Speaker 1: I don't see it as I don't feel like any of the platforms except are Technologically better or worse than others.

509
00:32:19,177 --> 00:32:21,203
Speaker 1: I mean the Facebook obvious is the worst interface cuz.

510
00:32:21,223 --> 00:32:22,086
Speaker 1: yeah Facebook II.

511
00:32:22,547 --> 00:32:24,898
Speaker 1: but I mean Why did they go with Google?

512
00:32:24,938 --> 00:32:26,790
Speaker 1: I don't think it's because Google's better.

513
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:30,265
Speaker 1: I think it's because there was probably a bidding war for this contract Google won.

514
00:32:30,285 --> 00:32:33,856
Speaker 1: It's hard to say because It's just how these things do.

515
00:32:34,257 --> 00:32:36,666
Speaker 1: yeah, it's which would have paid more money to keep them.

516
00:32:36,927 --> 00:32:37,950
Speaker 1: they would have stayed right?

517
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:42,107
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I think I think Google offered in send you know, those incentives are part of the.

518
00:32:42,248 --> 00:32:44,329
Speaker 1: you know They're half of the deal.

519
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,314
Speaker 0: But it looks.

520
00:32:45,374 --> 00:32:51,705
Speaker 0: it does look like Activision Blizzard awful also saw more value in being on YouTube Based on a bunch of the commentary.

521
00:32:51,765 --> 00:32:52,309
Speaker 0: I'm seeing here.

522
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:53,274
Speaker 1: What are the point?

523
00:32:53,535 --> 00:32:56,126
Speaker 0: I mean, this is new enough news where I don't have any like insight.

524
00:32:56,146 --> 00:32:56,950
Speaker 0: I haven't talked to anyone.

525
00:32:57,251 --> 00:32:59,037
Speaker 0: I'm going off a Kotaku article.

526
00:32:59,258 --> 00:33:00,382
Speaker 1: I think that the main phone.

527
00:33:00,402 --> 00:33:02,107
Speaker 0: I mean this article was posted today at 4 30 p.m.

528
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:06,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, the main point is not that one streaming platform is better than the other.

529
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,202
Speaker 1: That's like saying one TV channel is bedding the other.

530
00:33:08,222 --> 00:33:09,490
Speaker 1: they're all just channels, right?

531
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,942
Speaker 1: It's that the we have now reached this breaking point.

532
00:33:12,983 --> 00:33:14,990
Speaker 0: We are well, although you know, they are their ecosystems.

533
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:20,990
Speaker 1: We are definitely past the point at which the platform is no longer the eyeball holder.

534
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:24,813
Speaker 1: platforms now must fight over the content The contents.

535
00:33:25,013 --> 00:33:37,968
Speaker 0: the the streamer or the content makers are now the eyeball holders in this realm Which gives all the platforms even less reason to support non monetizable tiny streamers in any real capacity.

536
00:33:37,988 --> 00:33:38,389
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

537
00:33:39,472 --> 00:33:46,339
Speaker 1: So it hasn't stopped, you know any social media site from letting Whoever the hell post tweets.

538
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,550
Speaker 0: Yeah God total aside.

539
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:59,818
Speaker 0: But you all you young kids need to remember that the only reason email works at all is that machines, you never see block 99.99% of all emails anyone ever sends you.

540
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:19,647
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Twitter and all social media needs to do the same thing and block 99.99% of all posted content for any from anyone ever seeing it but I digress cuz it's time for Things of the day.

541
00:34:19,848 --> 00:34:29,750
Speaker 0: I think I've linked a big Clive a couple of times in the past But he's the guy who will take apart like dodgy Chinese electronics He buys off eBay and talks about how dangerous they are.

542
00:34:30,031 --> 00:34:32,239
Speaker 0: He'll like look at circuit board like it's really fun channel.

543
00:34:32,746 --> 00:34:33,578
Speaker 0: He'll blow stuff up.

544
00:34:34,121 --> 00:34:40,937
Speaker 0: But he posted something that was so amazing and I watched this whole video and I'm still dumbfounded.

545
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:42,100
Speaker 0: this fucking thing exists.

546
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:47,487
Speaker 0: So now he's reviewing MREs from armies around Europe and the world.

547
00:34:48,009 --> 00:34:50,436
Speaker 0: Okay, like I got a Lithuanian MRE.

548
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:55,976
Speaker 1: It's about a year expired But as well expired I wouldn't eat it, but well, it depends.

549
00:34:56,016 --> 00:34:59,632
Speaker 1: but the point is I mean It's probably gonna have like Lithuanian kind of food.

550
00:34:59,773 --> 00:35:00,034
Speaker 0: Yeah.

551
00:35:00,074 --> 00:35:01,340
Speaker 0: No, these videos are great.

552
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:05,560
Speaker 0: Like these army ration videos are already like you got like an Indian one.

553
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,880
Speaker 1: It's like those aren't too different from like the bags of Indian food you get at the grocery.

554
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,594
Speaker 0: I've gotten it eaten MREs before they're there.

555
00:35:11,655 --> 00:35:12,620
Speaker 0: Sometimes they're an experience.

556
00:35:12,781 --> 00:35:15,673
Speaker 1: I mean, they can't be that much different from like airplane food.

557
00:35:16,135 --> 00:35:17,380
Speaker 1: Uh, they're probably better than airplane.

558
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,833
Speaker 0: Problem is they're richer.

559
00:35:19,341 --> 00:35:28,839
Speaker 0: Yeah and you need a lot of nutrition because you're military ing and MREs are the ones that you tend to eat like in Combat like that night while you're still like fighting like that kind of thing.

560
00:35:29,281 --> 00:35:33,072
Speaker 0: So but this video is a Scottish Army ration.

561
00:35:33,613 --> 00:35:35,057
Speaker 0: It's the winter calorie.

562
00:35:35,117 --> 00:35:35,859
Speaker 1: Is it full of haggis?

563
00:35:37,023 --> 00:35:40,548
Speaker 0: All right, Scott No, it definitely has had.

564
00:35:40,569 --> 00:35:41,493
Speaker 0: it's actually just ramen.

565
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:45,665
Speaker 0: Oh But yeah, duh This is not.

566
00:35:45,745 --> 00:35:49,540
Speaker 1: I mean it can't be a good thing of the day of the Scottish Army ration doesn't have haggis.

567
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,707
Speaker 0: So it's a winter ration meaning.

568
00:35:51,748 --> 00:35:54,196
Speaker 0: It's extremely high calorie haggis.

569
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:59,271
Speaker 0: Uh What do you think it uses to heat up the food?

570
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:05,411
Speaker 1: because it's MRE has to be completely self-contained, you know in In Japan, they have those things that are illegal.

571
00:36:05,451 --> 00:36:10,499
Speaker 0: in the US where you like pull the string And yeah, it's a lot of MREs use different kinds of things like that that kind of thing.

572
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:13,387
Speaker 0: No, this one's fucking radioactive powered.

573
00:36:13,668 --> 00:36:13,948
Speaker 1: what?

574
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,272
Speaker 0: yeah, what.

575
00:36:15,312 --> 00:36:16,495
Speaker 0: indeed watch this video.

576
00:36:16,535 --> 00:36:17,076
Speaker 0: Holy shit.

577
00:36:17,136 --> 00:36:20,423
Speaker 0: This is a radio a Radiation powered.

578
00:36:20,504 --> 00:36:21,548
Speaker 1: you can't hurry.

579
00:36:21,628 --> 00:36:22,371

00:37:22,924 --> 00:37:26,240
Speaker 0: while we were watching this I joked with Emily like I wonder if it comes with whiskey.

608
00:37:26,401 --> 00:37:27,807
Speaker 0: And then of course it came with whiskey.

609
00:37:28,108 --> 00:37:30,820
Speaker 0: and then I was like, well, it didn't come with any iron brew.

610
00:37:31,342 --> 00:37:33,934
Speaker 0: And then sure enough he's like what do we have here?

611
00:37:33,994 --> 00:37:35,260
Speaker 1: So I mean I called the haggis.

612
00:37:35,641 --> 00:37:41,358
Speaker 1: I mean, I didn't think of iron brew until I saw it and I'm like, yeah, I was laughing so hard I had to rewind the video.

613
00:37:42,442 --> 00:37:43,286
Speaker 0: So what's your thing of the day?

614
00:37:43,588 --> 00:37:45,437
Speaker 1: So you may remember back in the day, right?

615
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:49,835
Speaker 1: There was a. it was a series of animated shorts the Senpai Club.

616
00:37:50,457 --> 00:37:57,380
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah By animation pair of people named make babies make baby tightness, right?

617
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,526
Speaker 1: So I was supporting.

618
00:37:59,807 --> 00:38:02,496
Speaker 1: make babies on patreon right like a dollar.

619
00:38:02,597 --> 00:38:03,620
Speaker 0: what I forgot all about him.

620
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,445
Speaker 0: Their last video was 11 months ago.

621
00:38:05,465 --> 00:38:07,371
Speaker 1: Trion recently added this feature.

622
00:38:07,391 --> 00:38:10,280
Speaker 1: That is a very tight integration with discord.

623
00:38:10,752 --> 00:38:11,662
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah I've we.

624
00:38:11,702 --> 00:38:23,215
Speaker 1: I was thinking about using that and what it does is basically if you are Patreoning a patronus, right and they set up a discord and you link your.

625
00:38:23,415 --> 00:38:25,220
Speaker 1: I linked my discord to my patreon account.

626
00:38:25,822 --> 00:38:36,700
Speaker 1: Anytime anyone that I patronize makes a discord and links it to their patreon channel I'm automatically joined and inserted into their discord server.

627
00:38:36,828 --> 00:38:38,388
Speaker 1: Yeah without even asking for it.

628
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:45,000
Speaker 1: and as a result once this feature was Established like I opened up discord and suddenly I was added to like a pile of server.

629
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,189
Speaker 1: Oh, I was like, ah, well who had it?

630
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,435
Speaker 1: Well, I'm I'm like.

631
00:38:48,475 --> 00:38:49,620
Speaker 1: am I logged into the wrong account?

632
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,142
Speaker 1: It's not.

633
00:38:50,504 --> 00:38:53,140
Speaker 1: I realized patreon added me to all these discord servers.

634
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:58,159
Speaker 0: So all these communities sort of formed and like some of them are rocking but it seems to have worked.

635
00:38:59,281 --> 00:39:08,516
Speaker 1: There was actually one discord I was in already that I was patronizing and before the feature was implemented And then when the feature came online suddenly a pile of users appeared.

636
00:39:08,536 --> 00:39:17,085
Speaker 1: Yeah, right but yeah, so Suddenly I was in the make babies discord just out of nowhere and I was like, oh, I guess it's got to be a good Community of people.

637
00:39:17,226 --> 00:39:23,756
Speaker 1: It's not that many people I guess but I was like, hey I guess this activity going on in that realm that you know, I thought was lost right.

638
00:39:24,318 --> 00:39:31,500
Speaker 1: and then suddenly Make babies posted this video on their YouTube channel uploaded two days ago about two days ago called menagerie.

639
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:42,327
Speaker 1: Oh my god, this looks so cute, right and it's a short Hilarious animation that seems to have been done as seems like a student team animation kind of deal But it is very high quality.

640
00:39:42,347 --> 00:39:43,794
Speaker 0: Wait, wait, wait goblins.

641
00:39:43,955 --> 00:39:48,148
Speaker 1: All right, right and The make babies person worked on this.

642
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:54,560
Speaker 1: Yeah made for another three-day animation Jam at goblins Alright, so I don't know if this so it's made for a jam.

643
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:07,460
Speaker 1: okay, I don't know when it was made, but it is very well made very hilarious and Worth watching whether you like, you know Senpai Club or not because it's nothing to do with Senpai Club other than that one of the creators is involved.

644
00:40:08,465 --> 00:40:10,563
Speaker 0: I'm into this Scott.

669
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:05,935
Speaker 1: It's not a clickbait panel.

670
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:06,820
Speaker 1: It's a good panel.

671
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:09,209
Speaker 0: It's all but it has a clickbait title that'll fill the room.

672
00:41:09,229 --> 00:41:10,454
Speaker 1: It's not that clickbait.

673
00:41:11,016 --> 00:41:11,297

Speaker 0: but more importantly It means that we already have a good YouTube video of this.

677
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:21,700
Speaker 0: so we don't have to bring any of our cameras to PAX East.

688
00:41:53,515 --> 00:42:04,840
Speaker 0: that that the the hosts of facts Mike and Jerry in the Opening address to the convention which is not flagged 13 plus they had a word fuck at least a thousand times.

693
00:42:22,328 --> 00:42:23,573
Speaker 0: I do see a lot of people what I'm.

694
00:42:24,035 --> 00:42:25,841
Speaker 0: it is a scary number of Geek guides.

695
00:42:25,902 --> 00:42:35,399
Speaker 0: fans like come up to the main theater entrance because usually all but one of the nights I basically run the entrance by myself for like hours and hours and hours at a time.

696
00:42:35,921 --> 00:42:41,920
Speaker 1: Lotta listeners come up and hang out which is I usually see people in line when they're checking in and checking out their board game.

697
00:42:42,221 --> 00:42:44,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, so, uh, yeah, we'll see you there.

698
00:42:45,012 --> 00:42:46,659
Speaker 0: And now let's talk about a board.

699
00:42:46,739 --> 00:42:46,920
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

700
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,427
Speaker 0: And the geek nice book a book is the tale of Genji.

701
00:42:48,668 --> 00:42:49,191
Speaker 0: Just read it.

702
00:42:49,231 --> 00:42:49,934
Speaker 0: It's about Genji.

703
00:42:50,175 --> 00:42:54,226
Speaker 0: It's kind of a while Not that smart Maybe is it?

704
00:42:54,266 --> 00:42:56,012
Speaker 0: you'll see it Genji.

705
00:42:56,032 --> 00:43:07,229
Speaker 0: I Feel like the whole Everything I've read so far is just kind of throwing shade at Genji by Showing Genji being Genji and everyone else.

706
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:10,159
Speaker 0: everyone I've met who was not Genji seems like a better person than Genji.

707
00:43:12,069 --> 00:43:16,620
Speaker 0: All right Time of crisis the Roman Empire in turmoil, right?

708
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:21,192
Speaker 1: So our friends bring this grog nard looking war game out.

709
00:43:21,312 --> 00:43:23,500
Speaker 0: Well, the box looks like your grog nard work.

710
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,484
Speaker 1: It's a GMT game.

711
00:43:24,525 --> 00:43:26,835
Speaker 1: those that's the company that makes the grog nard war game.

712
00:43:26,875 --> 00:43:27,820
Speaker 0: Yep, right.

713
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:32,340
Speaker 1: So you're looking at this thing and you're like, yeah, this is not you know, what's this gonna be like, right?

714
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:35,340
Speaker 0: What if I told you it is a deck builder?

715
00:43:35,726 --> 00:43:48,980
Speaker 0: Yep, like Dominion But it's a deck builder where every turn at the end of your turn you take pick up your entire draw deck Choose the five cards you want to draw and put the rest of your draw deck back down, right?

716
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,731
Speaker 1: So that's that's a real work of genius.

717
00:43:50,771 --> 00:43:52,060
Speaker 1: right thing about Dominion, right?

718
00:43:52,441 --> 00:43:55,720
Speaker 1: So Dominion is the like the first real deck builder, right?

719
00:43:55,820 --> 00:44:02,515
Speaker 1: And it's sort of set the stage for all other deck builders And all they all follow the basic template and nothing has been better than opinion.

720
00:44:02,555 --> 00:44:03,840
Speaker 1: You have a deck, right?

721
00:44:03,981 --> 00:44:05,446
Speaker 1: It starts out with just a few cards.

722
00:44:05,526 --> 00:44:12,933
Speaker 1: you draw some you play them all you put them on the discard Acquire more cards that also go in the discard and then you draw more.

723
00:44:12,973 --> 00:44:14,760
Speaker 1: but your draw you shuffle and draw randomly.

724
00:44:15,221 --> 00:44:21,180
Speaker 1: It's like well, what if you could just stack the deck and draw whatever five you wanted it, but everyone's stacking the deck?

725
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,030
Speaker 1: Well, it's not that everyone's stacking the deck.

726
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:24,900
Speaker 1: It's that okay, you're stacking the deck.

727
00:44:25,503 --> 00:44:30,810
Speaker 1: So for people out there who obviously are more likely to have played Dominion Imagine you're stacking the deck in Dominion.

728
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:32,960
Speaker 1: turn one fucking five coppers.

729
00:44:33,261 --> 00:44:34,406
Speaker 1: Yeah, turn two.

730
00:44:35,028 --> 00:44:37,800
Speaker 0: what two coppers in three notes.

731
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:43,398
Speaker 0: It's like if you blow your load on a big turn you're aft until that discard reshuffle.

732
00:44:43,458 --> 00:44:44,100
Speaker 1: What can you do?

733
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,129
Speaker 1: It's like okay, and then you shuffle again.

734
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:46,833
Speaker 1: See then you are.

735
00:44:46,853 --> 00:44:47,336
Speaker 1: you got mine.

736
00:44:47,376 --> 00:44:48,060
Speaker 1: now I do it again.

737
00:44:48,481 --> 00:44:55,080
Speaker 1: All right, I'm gonna do four coppers and the village that I bought or whatever, you know Whatever card it was that I bought right?

738
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:55,490
Speaker 1: it's like.

739
00:44:56,182 --> 00:45:01,569
Speaker 1: but then you get to the end of your deck and your discard is full of all the good cars that you stacked to make beautiful hands.

740
00:45:02,338 --> 00:45:06,331
Speaker 1: and Dominion is a little different because you can do the infinite draws.

741
00:45:06,572 --> 00:45:11,184
Speaker 1: Yeah, so stacking your deck would be ultra powerful, but There's another thing.

742
00:45:11,204 --> 00:45:12,830
Speaker 1: you can't do that in this.

743
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:15,600
Speaker 0: so there's nothing that lets you draw cards during your turn.

744
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:24,020
Speaker 1: So stacking your deck in this game It removes randomness, which is actually good to make some more game of skill and you it doesn't really help you cheat.

745
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:32,580
Speaker 1: It's not OP because if you give yourself a strong turn Then you you start to go through the whole deck before you can access the discard pile.

746
00:45:32,901 --> 00:45:35,872
Speaker 1: You're gonna have to have a weak turn and it's about choosing.

747
00:45:35,892 --> 00:45:38,040
Speaker 1: All right, maybe I'll take the weak turn on purpose.

748
00:45:38,141 --> 00:45:39,861
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll try to mix the turns together Right.

749
00:45:40,403 --> 00:45:45,200
Speaker 1: The other thing is that this text on some of the cards that does stuff, right?

750
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,008
Speaker 1: But really what?

751
00:45:47,048 --> 00:45:49,360
Speaker 0: the cards are three currencies.

752
00:45:49,822 --> 00:45:58,840
Speaker 1: there are three different currencies influenced with the people influence with the Senate influence with the Military and those three currencies are used to buy actions.

753
00:45:58,940 --> 00:45:59,765
Speaker 1: Which are the real act?

754
00:45:59,785 --> 00:46:02,820
Speaker 1: you have like a menu of actions that all cost action points.

755
00:46:03,242 --> 00:46:08,607
Speaker 1: some of them cause yellow some cost red and some cause blue and Most of them cost at least two.

756
00:46:08,627 --> 00:46:11,440
Speaker 1: I don't think many of the actions cost one.

757
00:46:11,942 --> 00:46:16,060
Speaker 1: So it's like if you're you know, as you stack your deck, okay, I want to do this blue action.

758
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,590
Speaker 1: So I'll take two blue cards in my hand.

759
00:46:18,013 --> 00:46:19,140
Speaker 1: I want to do that red action.

760
00:46:19,281 --> 00:46:21,832
Speaker 1: Oh, I bought a strong red card earlier in the game.

761
00:46:21,873 --> 00:46:23,440
Speaker 1: That is on its own worth to red.

762
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,295
Speaker 1: I'll put that in my hand and I want to do this yellow action.

763
00:46:26,315 --> 00:46:27,320
Speaker 1: Well that cost three yellow.

764
00:46:27,441 --> 00:46:28,707
Speaker 1: Well, I can't put six cards.

765
00:46:28,748 --> 00:46:31,120
Speaker 1: So you sort of like plan your next turn, right?

766
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:35,940
Speaker 1: You're picking the action points you need in currency from your deck of what's left of it.

767
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,508
Speaker 0: Anyway, but and here's where the game gets fascinating Like this is what makes this game good.

768
00:46:39,548 --> 00:46:44,130
Speaker 0: and why like we played it multiple times that it packs When we could have played other new games.

769
00:46:44,332 --> 00:46:44,894
Speaker 0: like it's rare.

770
00:46:44,955 --> 00:46:45,980
Speaker 0: We want to play the same game.

771
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,099
Speaker 1: We played it one and a half times.

772
00:46:49,461 --> 00:46:51,009
Speaker 0: We pretty much got to the end of that one game.

773
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:56,069
Speaker 0: It was oh it was over the writing was on the wall And I would play it a third time like I would play this again.

774
00:46:56,089 --> 00:47:05,710
Speaker 0: I like this game a lot, but the deck building in this game is actually a Rondel builder that just happens to use cards.

775
00:47:06,051 --> 00:47:09,959
Speaker 0: You're basically just building a Rondel Yeah, and you're filling it in in front of you.

776
00:47:10,321 --> 00:47:21,520
Speaker 0: You're basically and the brilliance of this is that it basically makes the game have a very real-world Wargame like abstraction because the games at essence really kind of a war game.

777
00:47:22,002 --> 00:47:25,156
Speaker 0: Basically, I make my plan at the end of my turn.

778
00:47:25,177 --> 00:47:25,900
Speaker 0: so I look at the board.

779
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,305
Speaker 0: I think about the things I want to do.

780
00:47:27,325 --> 00:47:37,480
Speaker 0: I could make a really complex plan where I have the exact number of points From my hand for the next turn to do something specific and powerful, but that might not work out.

781
00:47:37,981 --> 00:47:45,799
Speaker 0: If someone attacks me that I didn't expect barbarians invade the board state changes in a radical way And I have to react to this terrifying new world.

782
00:47:46,121 --> 00:47:50,120
Speaker 0: So I might choose instead a more safe or neutral hand to be able to be reactive.

783
00:47:50,683 --> 00:48:05,700
Speaker 0: So you sort of your plan and you invest in a path but then you have to react to the world when your turn comes about because if you've Invested in a military in the real world and then some shit goes down somewhere It's not like you can just teleport those soldiers somewhere different.

784
00:48:06,175 --> 00:48:09,627
Speaker 1: Yeah Also, you know Like we said the wait the cards are poor.

785
00:48:09,687 --> 00:48:12,276
Speaker 1: our currency points for different to buying different actions.

786
00:48:12,316 --> 00:48:13,400
Speaker 1: that are the actual doings.

787
00:48:13,602 --> 00:48:14,240
Speaker 0: Yep, right.

788
00:48:14,561 --> 00:48:17,132
Speaker 1: So you start the game with I think three three and three.

789
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:18,940
Speaker 1: three blue three red three yellow.

790
00:48:19,302 --> 00:48:22,339
Speaker 1: Pretty much takes at least two to do a meaningful action, you know.

791
00:48:22,701 --> 00:48:29,060
Speaker 1: So you can't really do like all three different kinds of actions in one job.

792
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:34,540
Speaker 1: You're gonna have like a red a military kind of turn or you know a people kind of turn.

793
00:48:34,962 --> 00:48:36,933
Speaker 0: So you got a debate like how are you gonna focus?

794
00:48:36,973 --> 00:48:38,180
Speaker 0: What kinds of things do you want to do?

795
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,680
Speaker 1: Well, you can't balance it out.

796
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:47,575
Speaker 1: You can't be like I'm gonna do a little bit of everything every turn because your hands not big enough and you also can't be Like I'm gonna go all military.

797
00:48:47,616 --> 00:48:50,959
Speaker 1: this game It's like okay you go all military in turn one and turn two.

798
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:52,105
Speaker 1: You can put.

799
00:48:52,326 --> 00:48:53,532
Speaker 1: you have one red card left.

800
00:48:53,552 --> 00:48:55,040
Speaker 1: you can put in your hand which does nothing.

801
00:48:55,842 --> 00:48:56,604
Speaker 1: Right, you can't?

802
00:48:56,744 --> 00:49:05,020
Speaker 1: you have to do all three things and any given turn will almost definitely be not Hitting on all three notes.

803
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:05,782
Speaker 1: it'll be your.

804
00:49:05,923 --> 00:49:14,611
Speaker 1: each turn will be focusing on one and a half of the areas of the game and Ignoring one area of the game pretty much completely like.

805
00:49:14,631 --> 00:49:16,076
Speaker 1: well, I did my military this turn.

806
00:49:16,096 --> 00:49:17,220
Speaker 1: I'm not doing any next turn.

807
00:49:17,624 --> 00:49:19,020
Speaker 1: I did a little bit of people this turn.

808
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:29,500
Speaker 1: I can do a little bit of people next turn but not too much on either turn and only in the latest latest late Game when you have super strong cars that you've acquired from winning already.

809
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:36,940
Speaker 1: Basically, you can do a whole bunch of things in one turn But then your next turn will still be crappy because you just spent all your huge cards in the first turn.

810
00:49:37,142 --> 00:49:38,800
Speaker 0: So kind of an aside, but I just saw this picture.

811
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:39,984
Speaker 0: I want to lose this train of thought.

812
00:49:40,586 --> 00:49:47,500
Speaker 0: my main complaint with the game is that it has some like UX and mechanical problems Because it's made it looks like a grognard war game.

813
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:53,720
Speaker 1: So all the UX and this graphic design of it is grog Nardi like to remember to know your purchasing power and everything.

814
00:49:53,761 --> 00:49:54,540
Speaker 0: They got to look at things.

815
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,920
Speaker 0: They have to confirm numbers several times just to make sure you're doing things, right?

816
00:49:58,602 --> 00:50:06,187
Speaker 0: And the first thing I said after I played the game once was if you just made a simple player aid This game would actually go a lot faster Like I can envision a very.

817
00:50:06,287 --> 00:50:09,360
Speaker 1: I think I mean you can just take the same as that game and retheme it.

818
00:50:09,582 --> 00:50:10,512
Speaker 0: No, the theme is perfect.

819
00:50:10,532 --> 00:50:11,200
Speaker 0: I don't want a different thing.

820
00:50:12,202 --> 00:50:21,620
Speaker 1: But the point is if you just made it look like a euro right or like a you know Root style you could totally pass this off to just everyone and it would be like a super popular game.

821
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:22,684
Speaker 0: But the board is fine.

822
00:50:22,724 --> 00:50:24,210
Speaker 0: The only there that the UX boards.

823
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:25,876
Speaker 0: Okay, the board is fine.

824
00:50:26,237 --> 00:50:26,478
Speaker 1: It's okay.

825
00:50:27,322 --> 00:50:31,160
Speaker 0: I mean yours is you never actually looked at where barbarians could go with your problem?

826
00:50:31,421 --> 00:50:32,284
Speaker 1: No, I mean I looked at it.

827
00:50:32,325 --> 00:50:33,449
Speaker 1: But the point is it's just.

828
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:34,091
Speaker 1: it's not.

829
00:50:34,353 --> 00:50:36,260
Speaker 1: you know, it's not like a beautiful board, right?

830
00:50:36,802 --> 00:50:42,380
Speaker 1: You could give this game just a graphical only makeover and it could be like one of the most popular.

831
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,100
Speaker 0: But all you don't even need to change the board.

832
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,740
Speaker 0: You just need to make a handful of player aids that sit next to the board.

833
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:49,940
Speaker 0: I mean that would token sound that would help significantly.

834
00:50:50,081 --> 00:50:52,999
Speaker 1: But I'm saying if you just need this not look like a Roman thing.

835
00:50:53,662 --> 00:50:56,671
Speaker 0: But I don't that the problem is the UX not the UI.

836
00:50:56,691 --> 00:50:59,339
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm just saying that's to sell it.

837
00:51:00,002 --> 00:51:03,767
Speaker 1: Yeah, no one's gonna buy the Roman thing I'll buy the Roman thing.

838
00:51:03,787 --> 00:51:05,776
Speaker 1: mechanics of this game are a hundred percent.

839
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:15,340
Speaker 0: but I'm looking at your aid your AI for because you can like have an AI in the game and it's pretty close to what I would have made as a player aid For the game itself, right?

840
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:22,648
Speaker 1: But I think the game is you know, it's the Romani parts of it are parts that rim likes But they're not parts that you know, the theme is not.

841
00:51:22,729 --> 00:51:23,993
Speaker 0: the theme is pretty.

842
00:51:24,033 --> 00:51:26,000
Speaker 0: even the core mechanics are pretty tied to the theme.

843
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:26,566
Speaker 0: That's the other.

844
00:51:26,586 --> 00:51:33,929
Speaker 0: they are very tied to the theme Yes, but those that made that makes for a very natural Heuristics and that make the game objectively better.

845
00:51:33,989 --> 00:51:37,320
Speaker 0: For example, there's Italy in the middle and all the other provinces.

846
00:51:37,481 --> 00:51:38,649
Speaker 0: It's a Roman crisis game.

847
00:51:38,669 --> 00:51:40,260
Speaker 0: You're putting your governor's out in place.

848
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:42,792
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can make it a fantasy theme and it would be fine.

849
00:51:42,953 --> 00:51:44,500
Speaker 0: But here's the deal one of the cool mechanics.

850
00:51:44,861 --> 00:51:55,815
Speaker 0: So one of the things you're tracking is you get points every round based on like how much control your dudes have in all the different regions and like how much you've invested into them like having buildings and things.

851
00:51:56,398 --> 00:52:00,352
Speaker 0: but You also track how many turns you had.

852
00:52:00,393 --> 00:52:01,215
Speaker 0: you were the Emperor.

853
00:52:01,416 --> 00:52:02,540
Speaker 0: Yep, meaning you control it.

854
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,371
Speaker 1: That's really the number one way to get point.

855
00:52:04,391 --> 00:52:05,740
Speaker 0: That is super neat.

856
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,387
Speaker 0: It's almost like a king of the hill game.

857
00:52:07,407 --> 00:52:10,680
Speaker 0: that's happening in the middle of the rest of this game, right?

858
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:14,160
Speaker 1: But the thing is right unlike real king of the hill, right?

859
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:17,556
Speaker 1: Which as you know the same sort of problems as last hitting and mobiles.

860
00:52:17,616 --> 00:52:20,308
Speaker 0: king of the hill in this game Just gets you points, but also makes you vulnerable.

861
00:52:20,448 --> 00:52:24,710
Speaker 1: is it's not about you know King of the hill type?

862
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:26,340
Speaker 1: rules often get wrong?

863
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:29,912
Speaker 1: Is that whoever's on the hill at the end wins and that can be good.

864
00:52:30,192 --> 00:52:35,160
Speaker 0: but usually it's man like try to do Really flag for the most number of second, right?

865
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:40,760
Speaker 1: It's like you'll play really really really well and dominate the whole game and then at the very end you finally run out of steam.

866
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,486
Speaker 1: Someone pushes you off and they win.

867
00:52:42,566 --> 00:52:52,520
Speaker 1: they are the winner and that feels like bullshit because you dominated all that time And that what seems like it was much more difficult and much more worthy of being called the winner, right?

868
00:52:52,882 --> 00:52:56,760
Speaker 1: So this game it's like yeah, you're getting points for the number of turns you were on top.

869
00:52:57,203 --> 00:52:58,996
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter if you're there at the end, right?

870
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,105
Speaker 1: It just matters who is there.

871
00:53:01,165 --> 00:53:04,094
Speaker 1: the longest right the longer you're there the better.

872
00:53:04,134 --> 00:53:07,091
Speaker 1: if you got up fall down and get up Again, and you're up there twice.

873
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:08,040
Speaker 1: That's great.

874
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,974
Speaker 1: That's just as being good as being up there twice as long.

875
00:53:10,994 --> 00:53:15,233
Speaker 1: and even if you say You know dump on the last turn and have a sad ending.

876
00:53:15,253 --> 00:53:18,606
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know because Rome Yeah, Rome.

877
00:53:18,787 --> 00:53:23,329
Speaker 1: Yeah, you'll still be declared the victor I get I get.

878
00:53:23,389 --> 00:53:29,860
Speaker 0: I get into a really precarious situation But then like everyone else got into some bullshit and I ended up in Italy but really weak.

879
00:53:30,362 --> 00:53:45,800
Speaker 0: But everyone else was so stuck dealing with their own crap That I kind of just hung out as Emperor for a few turns Like I just held on because everyone really wanted to unseat me But no one was willing to spend their whole turn doing it because they had other like much more important things to deal with.

880
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:51,494
Speaker 1: Well also mechanically speaking, you know There are many games out there that have a variety of victory conditions to choose from.

881
00:53:51,594 --> 00:53:55,780
Speaker 1: or if they don't have different victory conditions They have different ways to get victory points.

882
00:53:55,820 --> 00:54:01,160
Speaker 1: You could go say crown of Amara you could get red or you can go book right in this game.

883
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:05,220
Speaker 1: You could go and as a way to get victory points try to be the Emperor the longest.

884
00:54:05,281 --> 00:54:07,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, that will totally help you get a lot of victory points.

885
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:10,651
Speaker 0: You can also be popular in the districts that you control.

886
00:54:10,671 --> 00:54:13,480
Speaker 0: Yep, and or fight barbarians, right?

887
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:23,380
Speaker 1: You could just be popular in a few places or somewhat popular in a lot of places like yeah, okay rim You're the Emperor the whole damn game, but I'm super popular everywhere else.

888
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,996
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you're just the pup, you know puppet Emperor.

889
00:54:27,016 --> 00:54:29,484
Speaker 1: All right Right.

890
00:54:29,785 --> 00:54:39,480
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, you guys are all popular and whatever I went around destroying all the barbarians and all of these different ways to get points are equally strong.

891
00:54:39,621 --> 00:54:42,816
Speaker 1: I can't say that like one of them is just better than the others.

892
00:54:42,957 --> 00:54:43,843
Speaker 1: Yep, right It's like.

893
00:54:43,883 --> 00:54:45,737
Speaker 1: yeah, you can win in any of those ways.

894
00:54:45,818 --> 00:54:56,260
Speaker 0: one You gotta gotta balance how you're approaching the game - you have to react to what the other players are doing Yep, and three the game is more like a war game and that there's a lot of random bullshit that happens.

895
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:58,047
Speaker 1: Well, the barbarian fountains are random.

896
00:54:58,288 --> 00:54:59,954
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, the barbarian fountains are random.

897
00:55:00,135 --> 00:55:03,899
Speaker 0: The event cards are random Like shit just goes wrong all the time.

898
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:10,520
Speaker 0: Yep, Zenobia came up like right away and it was like messing with Italy in both our games just randomly.

899
00:55:10,922 --> 00:55:14,860
Speaker 0: But that's fun because that uncertainty is what makes this more like a war game.

900
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:17,249
Speaker 0: Well without the more naturalistic heuristic.

901
00:55:17,269 --> 00:55:20,060
Speaker 1: well because of this deck stacking, right?

902
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:25,039
Speaker 1: There is no other source of randomness besides the barbarians and event deck.

903
00:55:25,602 --> 00:55:28,613
Speaker 1: Therefore without those you would just solve.

904
00:55:28,653 --> 00:55:30,340
Speaker 1: this game like this is the optimal play.

905
00:55:30,662 --> 00:55:32,480
Speaker 1: Start try to start in these places.

906
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:44,340
Speaker 0: Stack your deck these this way buy these cards or at best it would end up turning into Honda's toy Tonica where the game is purely reacting to what other players are doing in a cycle, right?

907
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:49,279
Speaker 1: Now the barbarian the randomness could affect one player more than others, but that's working.

908
00:55:49,319 --> 00:55:53,440
Speaker 0: sometimes It's like sometimes open like Africa just gets overrun early and that sucks.

909
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,780
Speaker 1: But if you were there in aggregate it goes after everyone equally.

910
00:55:57,201 --> 00:56:02,320
Speaker 1: So even though the barbarians happen to overrun rim this game, right?

911
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:08,400
Speaker 1: It's like I still had to prepare just as much for barbarian invasion because it could happen in any moment.

912
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:16,485
Speaker 0: yep, or I take a risk and I like don't put any armies in Africa because I got a plan and then Barbarians happen there.

913
00:56:16,505 --> 00:56:18,793
Speaker 0: It's like well, oops, but maybe they don't.

914
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,760
Speaker 0: or maybe I got federati and I'm good to rock.

915
00:56:20,941 --> 00:56:22,507
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's a gamble.

916
00:56:22,547 --> 00:56:25,520
Speaker 1: still it is a gamble and it's a gamble for everyone equally.

917
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:38,362
Speaker 1: even though you know the tide might splash upon one player and not another everyone still had to pay the the price of Gambling, you know one way or the other or play out safe and I'm not gonna explain all the mechanic Like.

918
00:56:38,383 --> 00:56:39,480
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna teach you this game.

919
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:39,982
Speaker 0: That would be.

920
00:56:40,002 --> 00:56:40,684
Speaker 0: we already taught you.

921
00:56:40,724 --> 00:56:47,520
Speaker 1: the core mechanic of the game is deck building game where you stack your deck But you still can't access the discard.

922
00:56:47,605 --> 00:57:03,140
Speaker 1: Yeah And you're buying power to buy more cards is based on your popularity and control of provinces And there's several ways to get points and control is only with Popular and killing barbarians and all three of them are equally viable ways to get points.

923
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:09,511
Speaker 0: You're probably gonna have to mix it up to some extent and there's a bunch of fun little mechanics Like the only one I'll talk about like there's you know militias.

924
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:12,120
Speaker 0: then you got like Roman legions and all this stuff.

925
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:13,264
Speaker 0: But there's mobs.

926
00:57:13,986 --> 00:57:14,628
Speaker 1: Oh the angry mob.

927
00:57:14,648 --> 00:57:18,080
Speaker 1: The funniest thing about a mob is the fuck you stick.

928
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:20,109
Speaker 1: It's like I just want I want and rims winning.

929
00:57:20,129 --> 00:57:22,659
Speaker 1: I put mobs on rim, but mobs are real funny.

930
00:57:23,104 --> 00:57:26,750
Speaker 0: There's other things that can cause miles but basically if a mob it's usually putting them on other place.

931
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:37,815
Speaker 0: if a mob is in your territory like you have a governor in A territory and there's a mob then if you don't deal with that shit before the end of your turn you get less popular And if you're too unpopular, you just get replaced.

932
00:57:38,136 --> 00:57:38,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, like you're out.

933
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:45,567
Speaker 0: Yep, one way to deal with a mob is just if you have a legion there just go kill it But then people get pissed off.

934
00:57:45,969 --> 00:57:46,391
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, this is.

935
00:57:46,411 --> 00:57:47,696
Speaker 1: there's two different ways to remove.

936
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:50,164
Speaker 0: or you can build circuses You can run games.

937
00:57:50,244 --> 00:57:55,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can remove a mob with red military cards at but that costs you popularity.

938
00:57:55,540 --> 00:58:04,596
Speaker 0: You can play or you get yellow rifle card and placate the mob with yellow cards or you can build a build an amphitheater and then the mobs will stay and they'll still be a problem.

939
00:58:04,616 --> 00:58:19,605
Speaker 0: grow because Also at the end of your turn if any territory as a mob Daddy to mobs a bigger angrier mod the mob just keeps growing until you deal with it and the bigger if you have a Mob.

940
00:58:19,706 --> 00:58:22,080
Speaker 1: but I have a Colosseum so it's gonna be one last game we played.

941
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:25,360
Speaker 0: I just kept a pet mob for a couple turns because I didn't want to deal with it.

942
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:29,500
Speaker 1: There's also a building you can build that will deal with barbarians and convert them to your armies.

943
00:58:29,982 --> 00:58:32,757
Speaker 1: As long as your army is mostly Roman you could that's just no.

944
00:58:32,777 --> 00:58:34,183
Speaker 0: yeah the card Federati will do that.

945
00:58:34,224 --> 00:58:43,771
Speaker 0: the building just means when barbarians come into a territory where there's lemase or limes Yeah, they'll come in flipped over like inactive But then they're easy to bring in.

946
00:58:43,791 --> 00:58:45,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't to fight them, right?

947
00:58:46,001 --> 00:58:51,720
Speaker 1: But him next turn if they're still sitting there, yeah, but you know, they'll just kill themselves effectively if you played the Federati's.

948
00:58:52,809 --> 00:58:54,906
Speaker 0: Yeah There's a lot going.

949
00:58:54,926 --> 00:58:56,879
Speaker 0: this game is meaty and fun.

950
00:58:57,642 --> 00:58:59,667
Speaker 0: There aren't really other don't be right.

951
00:58:59,747 --> 00:59:02,514
Speaker 1: Don't be fooled by its grog Nardi war game.

952
00:59:02,554 --> 00:59:08,554
Speaker 1: Look, it's basically an awesome Euro game just like all those other awesome euro games you're used to but with a lot of.

953
00:59:08,574 --> 00:59:17,700
Speaker 0: it's not any harder than a Dominion or a small world but with a lot of the war game type That make war games interesting there's a lot of little harder than this plan.

954
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:27,058
Speaker 0: There's a lot of emergent behavior a lot of narrative will come about and the kind of planning you do in the game isn't the math of my next turn so much as the.

955
00:59:27,078 --> 00:59:38,400
Speaker 0: I need to focus on this area of the board or this type of thing next turn and I need to be mindful of the fact that based on that I will have fewer options until I reshuffle my deck.

956
00:59:38,802 --> 00:59:40,791
Speaker 0: So do I blow my wad now?

957
00:59:40,851 --> 00:59:42,659
Speaker 0: do I save my wad for a later turn?

958
00:59:43,341 --> 00:59:43,924
Speaker 0: What do I do?

959
00:59:43,965 --> 00:59:51,460
Speaker 1: not and also not enough can be said about again, you know There are lots of games that do this where they take a mechanic from another game and sort of let you cheat.

960
00:59:51,601 --> 00:59:53,140
Speaker 1: It's like well that would be cheating in Dominion.

961
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:59,120
Speaker 1: So you get that extra fun of feeling like you're cheating and it's okay and it but then the game is actually good.

962
00:59:59,221 --> 00:59:59,947
Speaker 1: So it doesn't.

963
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:00,976
Speaker 1: it's not that strong.

964
01:00:01,057 --> 01:00:07,323
Speaker 1: Yep I feel like I would have but it's fun to do a thing in a game that feels like cheating in the game The mechanic came from.

965
01:00:07,905 --> 01:00:10,392
Speaker 1: so I feel like that's actually for game designers out there.

966
01:00:10,753 --> 01:00:17,900
Speaker 1: find a game that has a mechanic and There's like an obvious rule for that mechanic that yeah, obviously you can't do that.

967
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:19,527
Speaker 1: That would be crazy op and cheating.

968
01:00:19,788 --> 01:00:22,459
Speaker 1: but then make a game where everyone's allowed to do that and it's not op.

969
01:00:22,721 --> 01:00:25,579
Speaker 0: Yep, and if you keep doing that, you'll just make dune maybe.

970
01:00:27,122 --> 01:00:29,240
Speaker 0: But yeah, I feel like I want to own this game.

971
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:32,289
Speaker 0: I think our New York set would like this and play it.

972
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:32,670
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

973
01:00:33,292 --> 01:00:35,037
Speaker 1: And I was like, have we played any game?

974
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:38,731
Speaker 0: Oh In New York, well, we haven't been in New York for a while.

975
01:00:38,772 --> 01:00:39,375
Speaker 0: is the problem?

976
01:00:39,737 --> 01:00:41,570
Speaker 0: like every weekend I'm an out of town or something.

977
01:00:41,591 --> 01:00:50,699
Speaker 0: Uh-huh last weekend I was skiing so the time you're ready to play a game in New York is gonna be warm Yeah, but then I can easily bike to your place where there's critical mass because there are four gamers and I'll be there.

978
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:51,703
Speaker 1: I'll be biking.

979
01:00:51,883 --> 01:00:55,458
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yeah, I'll also be biking but then that night we'll play a game.

980
01:00:55,779 --> 01:00:56,080
Speaker 0: obviously.
