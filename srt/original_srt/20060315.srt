1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,281
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday March 15th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:15,025
Speaker 0: We talk about our favorite anime.

3
00:00:15,587 --> 00:00:16,610
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:17,372 --> 00:00:22,749
Speaker 0: Well, I spent yet another morning down in Manhattan and it looks like I'm gonna have a new job sometime in the next month or so.

5
00:00:24,015 --> 00:00:25,284
Speaker 1: Job, that's better than the one you got.

6
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:35,988
Speaker 0: Oh significantly better in terms of paying at least $10,000 more a year and better benefits and Possibly regular travel to such places as Tokyo and London.

7
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:37,994
Speaker 1: Regular travel, I think.

8
00:00:38,015 --> 00:00:39,179
Speaker 1: what did you say once a year?

9
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:40,545
Speaker 0: Yeah once or twice a year.

10
00:00:40,565 --> 00:00:44,921
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see It's not like zipping around the world awesomeness.

11
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:47,169
Speaker 0: Hey go to Japan once for free is enough for me.

12
00:00:47,712 --> 00:00:50,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's it's better than zero anyways, of course.

13
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:56,844
Speaker 0: Honestly, if I go anywhere like that for business I'll totally take the print the next week after my business is done as vacation days and stay there.

14
00:00:56,864 --> 00:00:58,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a good move.

15
00:00:58,631 --> 00:00:59,255
Speaker 0: That's the plan.

16
00:00:59,296 --> 00:01:00,847
Speaker 0: then all I have to pay for is a hotel room.

17
00:01:01,732 --> 00:01:04,947
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe I'll sleep on the floor at katsu's family's house or something.

18
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:13,807
Speaker 1: Well I finally got my They the raise I was supposed to get like three month to a month and a half ago.

19
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,460
Speaker 1: Ah But I think they messed up and gave me too much money.

20
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,797
Speaker 1: Hopefully they're not listening, but that's okay As I got moneys.

21
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah money.

22
00:01:24,874 --> 00:01:31,889
Speaker 0: So anyway in the news There's this dude and for some reason this decided to make it to the level of news where it was on Slashdot and all over the place.

23
00:01:32,452 --> 00:01:41,270
Speaker 0: But some guy was playing World of Warcraft and he happened to be playing it on Linux in wine And he happened to be using a keyboard that allows you to make keyboard macros.

24
00:01:41,391 --> 00:01:43,726
Speaker 1: And if he can get that to work in wine, all I want is steam.

25
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:47,405
Speaker 1: damn it Was he using the sedaga thing or is he using real wine?

26
00:01:47,426 --> 00:01:48,250
Speaker 0: You know, I don't know.

27
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,183
Speaker 0: I've never tried to make World of Warcraft run in wine.

28
00:01:50,224 --> 00:01:51,090
Speaker 0: I don't know how hard it is.

29
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,070
Speaker 0: Some things just work really easily in wine.

30
00:01:53,311 --> 00:01:56,330
Speaker 1: I really just want steam to work in wine without paying for stupid.

31
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:04,790
Speaker 0: Internet Explorer runs fine in wine, but not civilization - oh no Internet Explorer works better in wine than in Windows.

32
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,294
Speaker 0: Yeah, it really does.

33
00:02:06,314 --> 00:02:06,876
Speaker 0: Yep.

34
00:02:07,397 --> 00:02:12,010
Speaker 0: But anyway this guy now the fact that he was using wine is not terribly relevant.

35
00:02:12,191 --> 00:02:15,210
Speaker 0: All it did was expedite his banning from World of Warcraft.

36
00:02:15,652 --> 00:02:20,509
Speaker 0: Basically, he programmed his keyboard to do repetitive tasks for him.

37
00:02:21,131 --> 00:02:25,686
Speaker 0: So he hits the I don't know B, I think that fancy logitech gaming keyboard.

38
00:02:25,726 --> 00:02:28,595
Speaker 1: the LCD display Yeah Where you can set up you can.

39
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:31,606
Speaker 1: it has like extra buttons on it and you can program it.

40
00:02:31,647 --> 00:02:36,686
Speaker 1: to say when I hit this Button do like a then B then F G and then up.

41
00:02:36,867 --> 00:02:37,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're just macros.

42
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:43,402
Speaker 0: So we made macros that would kill mobs for him in the game and he just kind of sit there tapping the button while they watch TV.

43
00:02:44,671 --> 00:02:50,846
Speaker 0: well, he was sitting there doing that and apparently a GM noticed and Private message him saying hey you a bot.

44
00:02:51,487 --> 00:02:55,737
Speaker 0: and because he didn't notice the PM they banned him from World of Warcraft for botting.

45
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,420
Speaker 0: and His argument in his defense is that he wasn't botting he was using a macro keyboard and there's nothing wrong with that.

46
00:03:03,066 --> 00:03:04,319
Speaker 1: I don't think there is anything wrong with that.

47
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:21,114
Speaker 0: Well, here's the thing by the only reason I bring this up as news because one This guy sounds like a total douche the guy who's complaining because if you read the his complaints He basically says to the effect of I blah blah blah ISP I'm important blah blah blah blah and then he goes on and talks about his problem.

48
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,600
Speaker 0: Like he makes a big deal about himself.

49
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:24,483
Speaker 1: Well, see the real.

50
00:03:24,503 --> 00:03:27,171
Speaker 1: I don't know why we keep having news about World of Warcraft.

51
00:03:27,211 --> 00:03:30,120
Speaker 0: the thing we hate because it's fodder for entertainment.

52
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:33,093
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is that get an epic talking about this news.

53
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:45,019
Speaker 1: That really bothers me is that This guy wrote somewhat intelligent emails compared to what most people write and the company like didn't even It's like companies don't communicate with people.

54
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:52,538
Speaker 1: It's like I hate it when you send a letter to a company and they don't actually read it and custom You know send you a response now.

55
00:03:52,921 --> 00:03:55,918
Speaker 0: See I anticipated you would say that because I agreed with you at first.

56
00:03:56,701 --> 00:03:57,924
Speaker 0: Until I actually read.

57
00:03:58,506 --> 00:04:05,217
Speaker 0: he kept replying as far as I can tell to the do not reply to this or you will get an automated response email address.

58
00:04:07,844 --> 00:04:08,578
Speaker 0: That's what I saw.

59
00:04:09,741 --> 00:04:10,624
Speaker 1: No, it looked.

60
00:04:10,745 --> 00:04:11,327
Speaker 1: it's like they were.

61
00:04:11,347 --> 00:04:18,793
Speaker 1: they give you if you read the first email it says do not reply to this But you know like directly but they give you an address that you can email to.

62
00:04:19,276 --> 00:04:23,311
Speaker 1: and then it looked like from then on He was talking to that email address that you're supposed to email.

63
00:04:23,652 --> 00:04:25,579
Speaker 0: I'm going based on the comments from slashdot.

64
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:28,788
Speaker 1: Who knows what you can say about that?

65
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:34,154
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway the point is here that more importantly I don't care that the guy was banned and it's probably good for him.

66
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:35,140
Speaker 0: He'll probably get a life or so.

67
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,260
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, definitely great for him that he was banned.

68
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,051
Speaker 1: I don't know why he's so.

69
00:04:38,132 --> 00:04:46,146
Speaker 1: I mean you'd be upset because he spent all these hours to make some numbers go up and now the numbers are deleted in the database, but Good now he's gonna get a life.

70
00:04:46,868 --> 00:04:48,534
Speaker 1: But the thing is he won't play another mo.

71
00:04:48,795 --> 00:04:53,808
Speaker 0: apparently World of Warcraft Can be played by a keyboard without a person there.

72
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,914
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, so can every MMO.

73
00:04:56,175 --> 00:05:00,844
Speaker 0: now now this is not some MMOs couldn't You.

74
00:05:00,864 --> 00:05:14,325
Speaker 0: but anyway, the problem here to me is that if you're playing a game Against a computer that could be played just as well if not better by a computer as opposed to by you then Why even play?

75
00:05:14,726 --> 00:05:17,256
Speaker 0: all you're doing is spending time to make a number go up.

76
00:05:17,658 --> 00:05:18,019
Speaker 0: I don't get it.

77
00:05:18,381 --> 00:05:27,180
Speaker 1: yeah, I mean think about if you're sitting there and there's a button and If you push the button a number goes up and all you have to do is push that button a whole bunch of times.

78
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:28,807
Speaker 1: What what are you doing?

79
00:05:28,887 --> 00:05:30,493
Speaker 1: sitting there pushing that button repeatedly?

80
00:05:30,514 --> 00:05:32,080
Speaker 1: What the hell's the point if anything?

81
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:41,088
Speaker 0: I say you should be encouraged to write macros to get through that tedious crap because I'll admit way back when I played the realm You know that old ass MMO by Sierra.

82
00:05:41,469 --> 00:05:42,051
Speaker 0: It's still around.

83
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:42,873
Speaker 0: the fans bought it.

84
00:05:42,953 --> 00:05:51,459
Speaker 0: It's kind of scary that it's still up, but Once I got past level 60 or 65, there was nothing else in the game to kill because the game wasn't done yet.

85
00:05:52,443 --> 00:05:56,920
Speaker 0: And I wanted to be level 100, you know, because I was a middle school high school kid with infinite free time.

86
00:05:57,644 --> 00:06:07,852
Speaker 0: Now instead of killing, you know Whatever's over and over again thousands and thousands of times a day hour after hour to get the one experience point I'd get to try to get myself up to a higher level.

87
00:06:07,873 --> 00:06:12,240
Speaker 0: I Just wrote a little Windows macro that would attack any monster.

88
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,081
Speaker 0: it saw well it would.

89
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:16,718
Speaker 0: you easily stand on a screen and attack any monster that walked into the middle of the screen and kill it.

90
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,554
Speaker 0: because I Was so powerful nothing could hurt me and that way I didn't have to waste my time and I still got to level 100.

91
00:06:21,554 --> 00:06:26,920
Speaker 0: I Don't see why people have a problem with other people using bots to level in a game.

92
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:28,840
Speaker 0: I don't need someone else.

93
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,580
Speaker 0: I mean if you have fun gaining levels in the game and exploring all the new content fine.

94
00:06:33,161 --> 00:06:37,180
Speaker 0: If someone else doesn't enjoy that I say that there should be no problem with them using a bot.

95
00:06:37,381 --> 00:06:39,730
Speaker 1: My question is why are any people playing it at all?

96
00:06:39,991 --> 00:06:40,613
Speaker 1: It just uh.

97
00:06:41,135 --> 00:06:42,400
Speaker 0: now I can see how the game would be fun.

98
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:49,175
Speaker 0: I mean I wouldn't mind playing the game if one I'd have to pay for it and Two if I could just pick whatever level I wanted to be play at that level.

99
00:06:49,195 --> 00:06:53,760
Speaker 0: when I was done with that pick a different Level play at that part of the game and then when I played all the parts of the game just stop.

100
00:06:54,262 --> 00:06:55,869
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean like I wouldn't.

101
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,138
Speaker 1: World of Warcraft was like a big world to explore some.

102
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:00,820
Speaker 1: you know Zelda's kind of fun when you're walking around exploring.

103
00:07:00,961 --> 00:07:06,907
Speaker 1: So maybe if the whole game was I can go anywhere the hell I want and do anything I want and just see everything to see.

104
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:08,613
Speaker 1: then I might do that once.

105
00:07:08,653 --> 00:07:13,236
Speaker 1: it would take me a few hours and I'd walk around Or ride around and see everything there was to see.

106
00:07:13,256 --> 00:07:23,822
Speaker 0: I mean honestly The only thing that bothers me about MMOs at least current MMOs at all Is just the fact that most of the game is just a grind to try to get to a higher level or get a higher Whatever.

107
00:07:24,364 --> 00:07:31,274
Speaker 0: and the only factor in determining how good you are compared to another character The only factor at all is how much time you spent playing the game.

108
00:07:31,294 --> 00:07:32,760
Speaker 0: There's no skill involved.

109
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:43,752
Speaker 1: And if you say there's skill involved well, uh, you're wrong and I'll argue you till the end of time Yeah, Oh whoever spends the most time playing the game That means they're the best as opposed to whoever's the best is the best.

110
00:07:44,153 --> 00:07:46,079
Speaker 1: I mean what if you know?

111
00:07:46,861 --> 00:07:59,989
Speaker 1: It's like saying if one guy sucks at sword fighting But he practices for a hundred years and another guy happens to be a natural amazing sword fighter And he practices for ten minutes that the ten minute guy should never win Regardless of his natural talent.

112
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:01,235
Speaker 0: now some MMOs handle that.

113
00:08:01,296 --> 00:08:02,140
Speaker 0: look at puzzle pirates.

114
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:07,340
Speaker 0: All right You've got puzzles that you do and say sword fighting is a versus Tetris II kind of puzzles.

115
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:14,020
Speaker 0: Now if you're if you play the game, you know for years and years and years and you get really really good at that.

116
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:15,367
Speaker 0: That's the equivalent of leveling.

117
00:08:15,387 --> 00:08:17,699
Speaker 0: you've gotten good in the real world at doing that thing.

118
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:24,817
Speaker 1: Well, there are in sword fighting puzzles a bad example because there's actually swords that kind of change the pattern and make it difficult But not so much.

119
00:08:25,841 --> 00:08:28,630
Speaker 0: All I was saying is that you can get better at it by practicing.

120
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:28,951
Speaker 0: Yeah.

121
00:08:29,111 --> 00:08:29,272
Speaker 0: Yeah.

122
00:08:29,452 --> 00:08:33,102
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you effectively level in the real world Mm-hmm.

123
00:08:33,123 --> 00:08:41,879
Speaker 0: Now if you just happen to be naturally good or say you start a new character now, you're level one again or whatever You're still just as good in the real world.

124
00:08:42,302 --> 00:08:48,546
Speaker 0: So now your low-level new character is gonna be awesome just because you're awesome in World of Warcraft or anything.

125
00:08:48,887 --> 00:08:52,400
Speaker 0: if you start a new level one character your character sucks ass because there's really.

126
00:08:52,842 --> 00:08:56,040
Speaker 0: The only thing involved are the stats and the stats only get bigger by playing the game longer.

127
00:08:56,595 --> 00:09:03,440
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, there is one thing is that if you played the game and you know your way around it It takes you less time to get the levels because you know, right?

128
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,863
Speaker 1: That's the only thing.

129
00:09:04,923 --> 00:09:17,080
Speaker 1: is it's like if you already know this arbitrary knowledge about this imaginary world Then it will take you less time To do these things because you already know what you're doing and the time it takes to figure it out is now already spent.

130
00:09:17,484 --> 00:09:18,920
Speaker 0: It's like when I beat Zelda 2 again.

131
00:09:19,081 --> 00:09:20,005
Speaker 0: I knew where everything was.

132
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:22,880
Speaker 0: I just went and got it and it saved me about 20 hours worth of gameplay.

133
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:35,355
Speaker 1: It's like if you went to the store to buy a stick of gum, right and it costs five bucks for your first stick of Gum, but then every other stick of gum ever cost only one dollar because you've already paid the four dollar stick of gum entry fee Of learning how to chew gum and buy it.

134
00:09:36,923 --> 00:09:38,120
Speaker 0: That was quite an example.

135
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:44,079
Speaker 1: I just had to make something up that was crazy because you got to be crazy to sit there and push a button over and Over again to make a number go anyway.

136
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:50,160
Speaker 0: I guess the only thing I want to say about this is to all of our listeners out there Even though this is anime day, so I'm gonna come off it in a minute.

137
00:09:50,501 --> 00:09:54,460
Speaker 0: But it's my news so you can all go to hell for anyone who plays World of Warcraft.

138
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:02,460
Speaker 0: Why on earth can I'd like you to give me in the forums any reason why people botting should be against the rules?

139
00:10:04,584 --> 00:10:05,616
Speaker 0: All right, that's all I want.

140
00:10:05,637 --> 00:10:09,045
Speaker 0: I Submit that to you all as a challenge.

141
00:10:09,787 --> 00:10:14,200
Speaker 0: And if someone gives me a good enough argument, I'll concede defeat and you'll win something.

142
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:20,162
Speaker 1: If he says you're gonna win something that means you're not gonna win Argument.

143
00:10:20,464 --> 00:10:24,060
Speaker 0: Well, I point out that no one won our previous mini contest.

144
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:27,920
Speaker 1: No one seems to even try any of our thousands of contests for prizes.

145
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,558
Speaker 0: Yeah, no one told me what the Duchy of Grand Fenwick was.

146
00:10:30,619 --> 00:10:39,610
Speaker 1: yet I guess that means that everyone either doesn't know our trivia's and they can't stand up to our challenges because we're always right or they Don't realize that we actually do have a lot of money.

147
00:10:39,751 --> 00:10:42,442
Speaker 0: and if someone actually came out with the awesome Yeah, hello.

148
00:10:42,482 --> 00:10:44,710
Speaker 1: My company just paid me more money than they're supposed to.

149
00:10:44,971 --> 00:10:45,693
Speaker 1: hello money.

150
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:46,837
Speaker 1: You can have it.

151
00:10:46,857 --> 00:10:47,740
Speaker 1: It could be yours.

152
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:49,266
Speaker 0: I don't think we're gonna give him money.

153
00:10:49,286 --> 00:10:50,570
Speaker 0: I think we'll give him swag.

154
00:10:51,032 --> 00:11:00,813
Speaker 1: Yeah, so today's anime manga comics day And since we got all anime for the main part of our show I gotta talk about some manga news and some comics news.

155
00:11:01,235 --> 00:11:02,500
Speaker 1: Well, the manga is my thing of the day.

156
00:11:02,581 --> 00:11:04,018
Speaker 1: So we'll stick the comics news here.

157
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:13,613
Speaker 1: You may or may not know but I bet that you know because I don't know movies and shit That's going on in the world and I know about this now.

158
00:11:13,653 --> 00:11:18,740
Speaker 0: You may not know the guy's name Yeah, but if we tell you the things he's done you'll think oh that guy

159
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,422
Speaker 1: Yeah, so

160
00:11:19,764 --> 00:11:21,169

161
00:11:21,811 --> 00:11:38,549
Speaker 1: so there's this movie coming out V for Vendetta And actually I have cautious optimism, which is more than I've had for any movie since probably Lord of the Rings and it's gonna have the Rogers not Roger Smith agent Smith.

162
00:11:39,215 --> 00:11:45,797
Speaker 1: slash Elrond is going to be V and Natalie Portman is gonna be the girl.

163
00:11:46,601 --> 00:11:50,053
Speaker 0: Now it surprises me to this day and it makes me feel old.

164
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:51,879
Speaker 0: How many people don't know who Natalie Portman is?

165
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:55,325
Speaker 1: Remember the damn name.

166
00:11:55,667 --> 00:11:58,560
Speaker 1: All I could remember was Star Wars chick and the professional chick.

167
00:11:58,881 --> 00:12:01,692
Speaker 0: Yeah, I remember from the professional but slash dot.

168
00:12:02,174 --> 00:12:08,220
Speaker 0: for any of you who are younger that I mean Younger than us even because this joke was old before we knew about slash dot.

169
00:12:08,822 --> 00:12:12,435
Speaker 0: Natalie Portman has been this long-standing inside joke on slash dot.

170
00:12:12,495 --> 00:12:13,940
Speaker 0: I don't even understand the inside joke.

171
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,040
Speaker 0: It was before my time, but apparently all the nerds knew who she was.

172
00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:24,885
Speaker 1: Yeah, she was in an awesome movie called the professional and then she was princess whatnot in Star Wars episode Princess whatnot.

173
00:12:25,186 --> 00:12:25,688
Speaker 1: I don't know.

174
00:12:25,789 --> 00:12:26,230
Speaker 1: What's her name?

175
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,616
Speaker 0: Alright Gauri.

176
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:31,946
Speaker 1: Okay, so The guy who wrote V for Vendetta.

177
00:12:32,006 --> 00:12:33,029
Speaker 1: His name is Alan Moore.

178
00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:34,633
Speaker 1: He's his British comic writer.

179
00:12:34,673 --> 00:12:35,094
Speaker 1: Basically.

180
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,340
Speaker 0: He's a scary-looking dude, but he's brilliant.

181
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,885
Speaker 1: He looks like a Dane like you.

182
00:12:38,945 --> 00:12:44,080
Speaker 1: read his stuff and you think he's just some like awesome British genius guy who writes awesome stuff.

183
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,557
Speaker 1: But really he's actually scary biker with a Rasputin beard.

184
00:12:48,617 --> 00:12:49,340
Speaker 0: He's Rasputin.

185
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:52,440
Speaker 0: He must have survived and lived to this day in order to make comics.

186
00:12:52,962 --> 00:12:54,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, you'll see a picture of him in the link.

187
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:55,878
Speaker 1: He's a scary biker.

188
00:12:55,998 --> 00:12:57,603
Speaker 1: Awesome Crazy guy.

189
00:12:57,683 --> 00:12:59,449
Speaker 1: Anyway, he wrote V for Vendetta.

190
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:00,955
Speaker 1: He also wrote Watchmen.

191
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:02,340
Speaker 0: Watchmen is what is I mean?

192
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,665
Speaker 0: I'm holding it in my hands right now.

193
00:13:04,126 --> 00:13:07,258
Speaker 0: It is perhaps one of the greatest works of American comic-dom ever.

194
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:09,266
Speaker 0: Yep Well Western comic-dom.

195
00:13:09,447 --> 00:13:17,097
Speaker 1: Yeah, but yeah, this guy's amazing at the writing and He wrote League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, I think and all kinds of crazy stuff.

196
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:25,428
Speaker 1: now He was kind of the deep story is I'm not gonna go into all the details mostly because I don't know all of them But he did contract with DC Comics.

197
00:13:26,191 --> 00:13:30,634
Speaker 1: He ended up being unhappy with the contract and He got out of it.

198
00:13:31,482 --> 00:13:47,669
Speaker 1: but in the contract he pretty much gave DC the rights to his stuff and You know, he's like, oh they tricked me out of it, you know, but then another second he'd be like, yeah You know, I was I was stupid and I gave it to him but now He doesn't want them to have it.

199
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:54,812
Speaker 1: basically he wants them to like stop printing his books Even though they keep sending him a check, huh?

200
00:13:55,093 --> 00:13:56,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's a little bit nutty in this department.

201
00:13:57,162 --> 00:14:04,920
Speaker 1: I don't know what what he's thinking but like He's kind of mad that they're making these shitty movies out of his stuff and he doesn't want them to be able to make the movies.

202
00:14:05,881 --> 00:14:09,280
Speaker 1: But if they're going to make the movies he wants them to take his name off of it.

203
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,442
Speaker 1: They're that he thinks they're using his name to like promote like He's.

204
00:14:14,622 --> 00:14:25,964
Speaker 1: he commented on how they printed new copies of E for Vendetta that say now a motion picture on the top And he's real unhappy about that, especially since his name is in big letters on it You know.

205
00:14:26,064 --> 00:14:29,120
Speaker 1: and how people are using his name like in association with the movie.

206
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:34,418
Speaker 1: When he's trying to say, you know, I think the quote was I've read this screenplay.

207
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:55,820
Speaker 1: It's rubbish Yeah, so this guy's real sort of angry at what people are doing with the things that he's written and You know the feeling I get is That he's just being cranky after he signed a contract and then later realized what he had done and too late you signed a contract.

208
00:14:56,127 --> 00:15:00,873
Speaker 1: tough shit You know, that's my feeling just based on interviews with him and such.

209
00:15:01,515 --> 00:15:03,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't actually know much about him.

210
00:15:03,261 --> 00:15:04,305
Speaker 0: I just know about his works.

211
00:15:04,686 --> 00:15:06,091
Speaker 1: Yeah, his works are excellent.

212
00:15:06,152 --> 00:15:08,340
Speaker 1: I suggest you indulge in all of them.

213
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:15,799
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you wonder why I was silent while Scott was on his monologue because I was holding watch in my hand I started flipping through it and then I started reading it and then I forgot that I was on the air.

214
00:15:16,621 --> 00:15:18,065
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's it's really good.

215
00:15:18,206 --> 00:15:19,249
Speaker 0: It's one hell of a comic.

216
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:22,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, and so is V for Vendetta, which you should read.

217
00:15:22,701 --> 00:15:27,019
Speaker 0: Yes, especially in light of the current socio political situation out there.

218
00:15:27,501 --> 00:15:31,191
Speaker 1: Yeah, see I from what I can tell is number one.

219
00:15:31,913 --> 00:15:37,950
Speaker 1: I saw I watched the second trailer for the movie and It's a trailer anyone can watch.

220
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:46,580
Speaker 1: I don't think it's one of those spoiler trailers But there's at least one scene in this trailer that I know for sure does not happen in the comic anywhere.

221
00:15:47,365 --> 00:15:52,431
Speaker 1: so either that's just a trailer scene or the movie is actually gonna change.

222
00:15:52,511 --> 00:16:03,670
Speaker 1: what happened in a big way and I've also heard like whisperings around the net that like okay V for Vendetta if you don't know is about Literally anarchy versus fascism in a direct conflict.

223
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:11,400
Speaker 1: That's what it's about that to put it very very bluntly Yeah, that's without telling you any details of characters or plot or anything.

224
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:16,860
Speaker 1: But that's that's the general theme of it anarchy versus fascism ha extremes in conflict.

225
00:16:17,805 --> 00:16:26,118
Speaker 1: from what I've heard the movie is like liberal versus fascism Like it's not the same thing.

226
00:16:27,283 --> 00:16:36,159
Speaker 1: That says the whisperings I've heard and I'm not sure and I'll probably go see the movie just to be able to talk about it Or see if my cautious optimism pays off.

227
00:16:37,161 --> 00:16:38,506
Speaker 1: Yeah, whoever's making this movie.

228
00:16:38,607 --> 00:16:47,014
Speaker 1: You're pretty much either going to like lose me on movies forever Or maybe you know like light a tiny little fire.

229
00:16:47,576 --> 00:16:48,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, the stakes are high.

230
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,219
Speaker 0: Maybe Scott go to movies again.

231
00:16:50,601 --> 00:16:55,340
Speaker 1: Maybe who knows it doesn't take much for me to go to movies used to make a movie that doesn't suck.

232
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,254
Speaker 0: Honestly, most of the movies we've gone to lately were anime movies.

233
00:16:58,757 --> 00:16:59,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can't.

234
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:03,220
Speaker 1: Since Lord of the Rings when have I been to a non sucky movie?

235
00:17:03,682 --> 00:17:04,484
Speaker 1: That wasn't anime.

236
00:17:04,747 --> 00:17:07,579
Speaker 1: that wasn't in an art theater either like a Hollywood movie, huh?

237
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,839
Speaker 0: Oh, you know what snakes on a plane snakes on a motherfucking plane.

238
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,003
Speaker 0: There's not a goddamn thing you can do about it.

239
00:17:20,755 --> 00:17:34,180
Speaker 0: So it being anime day now earlier today I was poking around looking for videos of old cosplays for various reasons and There are basically a lot of laws and problems with putting the cosplay videos from cons online.

240
00:17:34,685 --> 00:17:40,994
Speaker 1: Like you're not allowed to portray copyrighted characters and all this stuff and it's all legal gray areas and blah.

241
00:17:41,315 --> 00:17:47,940
Speaker 0: now Otakon has had a very strict Long-standing policy on this and they've gone after people who have put up the cosplay videos in the past.

242
00:17:48,662 --> 00:17:54,520
Speaker 0: Well, I discovered looking through Google video that all of those cosplays are in fact available online.

243
00:17:55,261 --> 00:17:58,160
Speaker 0: Awesome, not only those but cosplays from many other conventions.

244
00:17:58,823 --> 00:18:10,780
Speaker 0: I linked to it in my post, but it's basically cosplay memories calm and They're basically flaunting all the warnings and cease-and-desist and whatever they've gotten and they just host a pile of cosplay videos.

245
00:18:11,522 --> 00:18:14,309
Speaker 1: Now look, there's a big picture, Ohio con 2003.

246
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:18,300
Speaker 0: download the video now if you watch no other cosplay video in your life ever.

247
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:22,865
Speaker 0: I want you to go to Otakon 2004 Mmm, and watch.

248
00:18:22,985 --> 00:18:28,674
Speaker 0: there are two skits and it lists because it breaks everyone up into four parts and it lists what sketches are in each part.

249
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:32,893
Speaker 0: Watch the one that involves Muppets and utenna.

250
00:18:32,913 --> 00:18:36,147
Speaker 1: I think it's called like Something something.

251
00:18:36,267 --> 00:18:38,520
Speaker 0: if you search for the word Muppet, you'll find it on the page.

252
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,307
Speaker 0: Yeah, and to shadow with an axe.

253
00:18:41,668 --> 00:18:43,532
Speaker 1: shadow with an axe is the man.

254
00:18:43,572 --> 00:18:46,680
Speaker 0: He is quite literally shadow with an axe.

255
00:18:47,342 --> 00:18:48,606
Speaker 1: This guy's freaking awesome.

256
00:18:48,626 --> 00:18:50,130
Speaker 1: I remember I saw him cuz I was in.

257
00:18:50,552 --> 00:18:51,394
Speaker 1: I've got this new.

258
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,360
Speaker 1: was it starting in 2004?

259
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,431
Speaker 1: We started this thing where we would go to the overflow room for the cosplay.

260
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:59,623
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you don't have to worry about Coming and going.

261
00:18:59,643 --> 00:19:00,367
Speaker 0: there's no line.

262
00:19:00,628 --> 00:19:03,220
Speaker 0: You can yell and scream and make fun of people and no one cares.

263
00:19:04,201 --> 00:19:04,843
Speaker 1: Yep, I think.

264
00:19:04,903 --> 00:19:14,039
Speaker 1: and also in 2004 you there's a. you can see Mike Pfeffer our friend doing his Jewish wolf would yeah doing his comedy routine, which isn't so bad.

265
00:19:14,661 --> 00:19:18,313
Speaker 1: That was actually quite a good year for cosplay the most recent one only.

266
00:19:18,353 --> 00:19:21,484
Speaker 1: like one or two of them were entertaining the rest of Them were kind of bleh.

267
00:19:21,925 --> 00:19:22,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, I missed it this year.

268
00:19:22,949 --> 00:19:24,233
Speaker 0: I forgot what I've ever last year.

269
00:19:24,253 --> 00:19:25,036
Speaker 0: I forget what I was doing.

270
00:19:25,056 --> 00:19:26,543
Speaker 1: I Don't know.

271
00:19:26,584 --> 00:19:27,636
Speaker 1: We only saw part of it.

272
00:19:28,644 --> 00:19:30,634
Speaker 1: It was kind of yeah.

273
00:19:30,855 --> 00:19:34,445
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, all right.

274
00:19:34,525 --> 00:19:37,899
Speaker 1: So I was gonna talk about this manga thing for my thing of the day.

275
00:19:38,462 --> 00:19:44,806
Speaker 0: This is kind of weird and I just want to preface Scott's thing by saying if any of you know what the deal is with This let us know.

276
00:19:44,826 --> 00:19:53,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, go to our forums at front row crew calm Slash forum, whatever and tell us well, actually the forums have been pretty rocking this week.

277
00:19:53,902 --> 00:20:03,472
Speaker 1: Yeah, like more so than usual it seems like it gets real quiet But if I bother to start a thread it will explode which means there's a lot of people just sitting there checking for new stuff but not putting new stuff.

278
00:20:03,956 --> 00:20:09,515
Speaker 1: so People if you put new stuff in the forum other people will start talking to you.

279
00:20:09,555 --> 00:20:11,000
Speaker 1: They're there, you know.

280
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:18,760
Speaker 0: So I have noticed like now some people are starting to post the thread for the day's episode on their own Which is good because we didn't really want to have to do that forever.

281
00:20:18,881 --> 00:20:22,559
Speaker 1: The only reason I did that was like sort of like as a a seed.

282
00:20:23,162 --> 00:20:26,977
Speaker 1: Yeah, what's the word for the chemicals that make reactions catalyst?

283
00:20:27,218 --> 00:20:27,700
Speaker 1: That's it.

284
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:30,914
Speaker 1: It's trying to catalyze the conversations going on in there.

285
00:20:30,934 --> 00:20:39,640
Speaker 0: I didn't want it to become a thing yeah, but our eventual goal was that you guys would all talk amongst yourselves and Just have fun without us always having to be there in the way.

286
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:46,765
Speaker 1: Yeah, but for now on my policy is gonna be if the forms are quiet for like more than I don't know like 12 hours I'll start something.

287
00:20:47,328 --> 00:20:47,750
Speaker 0: You know what?

288
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:49,056
Speaker 0: Let's just start horrible arguments.

289
00:20:49,377 --> 00:20:53,556
Speaker 1: All right, cool All right, that'd be awesome to start giant flame war forum.

290
00:20:53,837 --> 00:21:00,732
Speaker 1: Haha alright, so anyway when Osamu Tezuka first started drawing manga like Astro Boy and whatnot?

291
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:10,740
Speaker 1: or Tetsu on Adam or whatever you want to call him He everyone knows that he got a lot of inspiration from Mickey Mouse and Mickey Mouse has four four fingers.

292
00:21:11,727 --> 00:21:28,851
Speaker 1: so he drew Astro Boy with four fingers just like Mickey Mouse And he stuck with that until one day He went and talked to some people at Disney and he said hey Disney people Why do you draw Mickey Mouse with only four fingers?

293
00:21:29,212 --> 00:21:31,060
Speaker 0: Well, why did they draw him with only four fingers?

294
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:42,620
Speaker 1: well apparently if you try to animate Mickey Mouse like an animation of him as opposed to a Comic on paper and you draw him with four fingers Well, if you draw him with four fingers It looks fine.

295
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:50,835
Speaker 1: If you draw Mickey Mouse with five fingers and animate him with old-school animation technology It looks like he has six fingers when he's moving.

296
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:57,220
Speaker 0: now I've seen because I know the Simpsons did that for the same reason in fact even made jokes about it one day.

297
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,156
Speaker 0: They talked about like the fifth magic finger on someone.

298
00:22:00,176 --> 00:22:04,860
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm So I don't know what that's caused by but I assume it's true.

299
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:08,458
Speaker 1: But what happened was after they told that to mr.

300
00:22:08,498 --> 00:22:08,780
Speaker 1: Tezuka?

301
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:20,153
Speaker 1: He stopped drawing Astro boy with only four fingers instead of drawing him with five because he's probably thought that was stupid Uh-huh, and it's probably just their shitty animation techniques, which whatever.

302
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:22,020
Speaker 0: I have no idea, but I have no idea.

303
00:22:22,321 --> 00:22:25,720
Speaker 0: I have no idea either but I know that other animators have had the same problem.

304
00:22:26,246 --> 00:22:26,468
Speaker 1: I do.

305
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,420
Speaker 1: I do have no idea.

306
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:32,199
Speaker 1: But I also know that I've seen Astro Boy with four and five fingers in different situations.

307
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:32,540
Speaker 0: All right.

308
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,357
Speaker 1: So anyway, anyway, there's a new problem quote-unquote problem.

309
00:22:37,738 --> 00:22:44,680
Speaker 1: in manga Someone or a few people are drawing people with six fingers now.

310
00:22:45,922 --> 00:22:47,850
Speaker 1: There are a few examples on this page here.

311
00:22:48,232 --> 00:22:50,200
Speaker 0: The one from Death Note is kind of scary-looking.

312
00:22:51,001 --> 00:22:56,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, the one from Death Note is kind of freaky, but the most of them involves someone pointing.

313
00:22:57,062 --> 00:23:07,576
Speaker 1: So what it looks like you see it doesn't look too freaky when someone's pointing so I can understand what it's about is, you know Four fingers clenched with a thumb clenched looks like a fist.

314
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:13,613
Speaker 1: It looks perfectly normal If you add an index finger pointing, but you still have the four clenched fingers.

315
00:23:14,194 --> 00:23:14,997
Speaker 1: It looks kind of.

316
00:23:15,097 --> 00:23:16,260
Speaker 1: it doesn't look kind of scary.

317
00:23:17,181 --> 00:23:18,586
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't look out of the ordinary.

318
00:23:18,626 --> 00:23:26,960
Speaker 1: You won't catch it because four fingers clenched in a fist makes sense It looks right and one pointing finger and a bunch of clenched fingers looks right.

319
00:23:27,101 --> 00:23:32,000
Speaker 1: So, you know, even though there's six fingers there, it doesn't Get all weird on you.

320
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:35,717
Speaker 1: so maybe the artist messed up or maybe they did it on purpose because they thought it looked better.

321
00:23:35,737 --> 00:23:42,600
Speaker 1: because In some ways, you know drawing only three fingers clenched can look kind of silly, you know with one sticking out.

322
00:23:43,664 --> 00:23:44,246
Speaker 1: I can see that.

323
00:23:44,326 --> 00:23:47,840
Speaker 1: but the one picture that's the scariest is the one from Prince of Tennis.

324
00:23:47,981 --> 00:23:52,985
Speaker 1: This guy's throwing a ball in the air and his hand is looks kind of like a squid Cuz.

325
00:23:53,025 --> 00:23:54,734
Speaker 1: he's got like the four fingers.

326
00:23:54,754 --> 00:23:57,887
Speaker 1: It's you it's a. That one freaks me out.

327
00:23:57,907 --> 00:23:58,952
Speaker 1: I don't know what they did there.

328
00:23:59,455 --> 00:24:00,520
Speaker 1: That's the one that messes me up.

329
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:04,380
Speaker 0: So well, I know in photography, I mean there was a long time ago at the end of high school.

330
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,073
Speaker 0: I was at a photo shoot, you know, most people get their high school like photo whatever.

331
00:24:08,093 --> 00:24:09,077
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

332
00:24:09,097 --> 00:24:11,310
Speaker 1: Yeah high school pictures We just we had a photo studio.

333
00:24:11,351 --> 00:24:11,955
Speaker 1: We all went to.

334
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:22,199
Speaker 0: yes I went to the studio and one picture they wanted is they wanted me to be like standing there with my sport jacket off But holding it like up over my shoulder in my like in my finger with my fist.

335
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:33,205
Speaker 0: You've seen this pose and you know magazines whatever and I held it the way I always do two fingers in the coat to hold it up and then my other two fingers just in my fist Mm-hmm, and that's the way most people hold a coat.

336
00:24:33,245 --> 00:24:34,929
Speaker 0: just because it's easy one finger is not enough.

337
00:24:34,949 --> 00:24:37,568
Speaker 0: and The photographer said nope.

338
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,639
Speaker 0: You gotta only have one finger in there.

339
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,589
Speaker 0: otherwise, it looks weird when I take the picture even though it looks okay in the real world.

340
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:45,767
Speaker 0: and That stuck with me to this day.

341
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:46,552
Speaker 1: Really?

342
00:24:46,733 --> 00:24:47,578
Speaker 1: Yeah, huh?

343
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,163
Speaker 0: Showed me cuz he took two pictures.

344
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:50,965
Speaker 0: Yeah, sure enough.

345
00:24:51,005 --> 00:24:53,570
Speaker 0: My fist just looked kind of off when both fingers were hidden.

346
00:24:54,668 --> 00:25:02,643
Speaker 1: hmm Yeah, I gotta admit the four-fingered with the point one single finger pointing looks okay You know.

347
00:25:02,844 --> 00:25:05,555
Speaker 0: now I gotta look at Phoenix Wright and make sure he only has five fingers.

348
00:25:05,957 --> 00:25:06,479
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

349
00:25:07,323 --> 00:25:09,633
Speaker 1: Oh my god, if Phoenix Wright has six fingers, I'm surprised.

350
00:25:09,834 --> 00:25:10,175
Speaker 1: Hold on.

351
00:25:10,196 --> 00:25:11,099
Speaker 1: I gotta go to the website.

352
00:25:12,201 --> 00:25:16,514
Speaker 0: Well, the pause there was while we looked it up and sure enough Phoenix Wright has five fingers.

353
00:25:16,735 --> 00:25:18,240
Speaker 1: Hooray Phoenix Wright is not a freak.

354
00:25:19,481 --> 00:25:22,492
Speaker 0: So it being favorites week and it being Wednesday.

355
00:25:23,094 --> 00:25:28,739
Speaker 1: We're gonna talk about our favorite anime and I guess we'll say a favorite manga in comics for some other day.

356
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:42,020
Speaker 0: Yeah Since we realized that talking about comics my any one of these categories would take an entire show at least so probably have favorites week Number two sometime in the future basically whenever we run out of better ideas for themes.

357
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:52,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I think I've said this at the beginning of every episode this week And I'm going to continue to because we have separate feeds and some people might be only listening to this episode this week.

358
00:25:53,021 --> 00:25:54,169
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wouldn't imagine why.

359
00:25:54,189 --> 00:26:00,959
Speaker 1: yeah, I don't know why either but The favorites week is not the same thing as best week.

360
00:26:02,081 --> 00:26:06,274
Speaker 1: You see when something is your favorite that means you like it more than anything else.

361
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:13,100
Speaker 1: when something is the best That means you consider it to be superior in quality, even though you might completely hate it.

362
00:26:14,185 --> 00:26:15,160
Speaker 0: Now it's not the same thing.

363
00:26:15,281 --> 00:26:16,780
Speaker 0: So for some people it is the same thing.

364
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,993
Speaker 0: But I found that most people there's actually a very clear distinction.

365
00:26:20,013 --> 00:26:21,840
Speaker 0: if you actually think about it now.

366
00:26:22,121 --> 00:26:23,144
Speaker 0: I'll clear there right away.

367
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:27,919
Speaker 0: my favorite anime are irresponsible captain Tyler and shoujo kakumei Utena.

368
00:26:28,501 --> 00:26:44,139
Speaker 1: But the best anime in my opinion are cowboy bebop Evangelion eska flown a yep I mean if you think about movies the best movie is citizen Kane But I really couldn't watch it too many times without going but it It's the best movie.

369
00:26:44,621 --> 00:26:51,280
Speaker 1: But my favorite movie would either be like the original Star Wars trilogy or the first matrix movie or something like that.

370
00:26:51,441 --> 00:26:52,533
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe Lord of the Rings.

371
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:56,208
Speaker 0: Yeah But anyway, all right, so anime.

372
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:59,840
Speaker 0: now we've both been watching anime for a long time.

373
00:27:00,903 --> 00:27:04,611
Speaker 1: Let's see When I was in thundercats and such.

374
00:27:04,852 --> 00:27:06,379
Speaker 0: Oh if you count that stuff my whole life.

375
00:27:06,741 --> 00:27:12,160
Speaker 1: But if you only count real anime, we I think we both go back to the sci-fi channel in the early high school days.

376
00:27:12,441 --> 00:27:13,225
Speaker 0: Yeah high school.

377
00:27:13,305 --> 00:27:14,390
Speaker 0: I'm talking fourth grade.

378
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:16,540
Speaker 1: No, I don't think it was on sci-fi channel.

379
00:27:16,741 --> 00:27:26,617
Speaker 0: Maybe it wasn't even though the first time I'm aware of the sci-fi channel showing anime I was in fourth grade and they showed vampire hunter D. Kashan robot hunter robot carnival.

380
00:27:27,239 --> 00:27:28,021
Speaker 0: Oh god What else.

381
00:27:28,141 --> 00:27:33,555
Speaker 0: project a co Odin which I'd forgotten about until those anime world order guys talked about it.

382
00:27:33,655 --> 00:27:34,477
Speaker 0: It's the worst show ever.

383
00:27:34,497 --> 00:27:38,400
Speaker 1: Oh Yeah, I think they actually said it was the worst show ever.

384
00:27:39,803 --> 00:27:42,855
Speaker 0: I mean I used to say great digital target was the worst show ever, but I think it is.

385
00:27:43,056 --> 00:27:44,180
Speaker 0: I'd forgotten about Odin.

386
00:27:45,065 --> 00:27:47,199
Speaker 1: Well, maybe we'll have to reconsider by watching them both.

387
00:27:50,276 --> 00:27:51,993
Speaker 1: The Worst week is gonna be a different week.

388
00:27:52,013 --> 00:28:01,933
Speaker 0: So yeah Now when I first saw anime like when I first realized that wait a minute These are cartoons, but they're good and they're not just for kids.

389
00:28:01,954 --> 00:28:02,816
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

390
00:28:02,837 --> 00:28:05,809
Speaker 0: I Freaked out and I loved any anime I could see.

391
00:28:05,949 --> 00:28:07,175
Speaker 0: I watched anything.

392
00:28:07,255 --> 00:28:08,280
Speaker 0: I rented every single tape.

393
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:15,722
Speaker 1: They had a blockbuster I remember like I wasn't like super into anime like I had seen it and I knew what it was and I kind of wanted to See more.

394
00:28:15,782 --> 00:28:17,347
Speaker 1: but I wasn't like whoo crazy.

395
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:20,940
Speaker 1: and then there was like an anime week on the sci-fi channel at some point.

396
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:21,642
Speaker 1: We're like every night.

397
00:28:21,663 --> 00:28:26,420
Speaker 1: They showed some anime and like the first day was like fatal fury.

398
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,770
Speaker 1: It was like king of fighters or something like that.

399
00:28:29,212 --> 00:28:33,820
Speaker 1: You know, the the neo-geo fighting game And I was even watching that and like all excited.

400
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,420
Speaker 1: But yeah, I mean I read much to make me go.

401
00:28:39,582 --> 00:28:41,006
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean any anime in the world.

402
00:28:41,047 --> 00:28:44,377
Speaker 0: I loved it and it really honestly for all the years.

403
00:28:44,498 --> 00:28:45,120
Speaker 0: I watched anime.

404
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,620
Speaker 0: It wasn't until I got to college that I saw what I would consider good anime.

405
00:28:49,481 --> 00:28:50,788
Speaker 1: Yeah towards the end of high school.

406
00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:59,017
Speaker 1: I actually wanted to watch a lot of anime And then when I saw there was a little anime club, I was like, oh, yeah There's where I'm gonna get it cuz right now I can't really get it so much.

407
00:28:59,359 --> 00:28:59,460
Speaker 0: now.

408
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:08,767
Speaker 0: I remember very clearly that the first anime club meeting of the RIT anime club now all of us the whole crew was there But none of us knew each other yet.

409
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:09,931
Speaker 1: We're sitting.

410
00:29:09,951 --> 00:29:14,215
Speaker 0: I was sitting like with some weird stranger people that yeah I was sitting with a friend of mine from high school.

411
00:29:14,638 --> 00:29:14,779
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

412
00:29:15,401 --> 00:29:20,137
Speaker 0: And all I know is that they showed cowboy bebop episode 5 and showed that.

413
00:29:20,377 --> 00:29:21,160
Speaker 1: yeah, they showed gunsmith.

414
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,047
Speaker 0: Yeah, gunsmith cats, which is awesome.

415
00:29:23,127 --> 00:29:25,375
Speaker 1: They showed music videos, which I'd never seen before.

416
00:29:25,536 --> 00:29:26,600
Speaker 0: Yeah anime music videos.

417
00:29:26,741 --> 00:29:28,780
Speaker 0: I had found one once when I was in high school.

418
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:30,309
Speaker 1: I don't even know what the hell they said.

419
00:29:30,329 --> 00:29:31,275
Speaker 1: they were showing music videos.

420
00:29:31,295 --> 00:29:32,000
Speaker 1: I was like, what the hell?

421
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,183
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, here's the thing.

422
00:29:33,244 --> 00:29:36,156
Speaker 0: I found an AMV and I didn't know what it was, but it's.

423
00:29:36,236 --> 00:29:37,220
Speaker 0: I still have it to this day.

424
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:42,240
Speaker 0: It's just a crappy little AVI to Sailor Moon and Phil Collins some Phil Collins song.

425
00:29:43,003 --> 00:29:46,819
Speaker 0: And I remember thinking it was this unique awesome thing and the person who did it must have been so cool.

426
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:57,856
Speaker 0: and Then I saw AMV is there's a million of them and oh it's real hard to be cool now on the internet where everything is mixed with everything But a cowboy bebop.

427
00:29:57,897 --> 00:29:59,803
Speaker 0: and To this day.

428
00:29:59,863 --> 00:30:04,580
Speaker 0: I still really haven't found a show that as a whole in my opinion is better than cowboy bebop.

429
00:30:05,142 --> 00:30:05,985
Speaker 1: I mean, I gotta agree.

430
00:30:06,025 --> 00:30:07,932
Speaker 1: The best anime is kind of bebop.

431
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:09,980
Speaker 0: But I mean there are shows that are real close.

432
00:30:10,161 --> 00:30:12,120
Speaker 0: Evangelion I think is a masterpiece.

433
00:30:12,762 --> 00:30:18,620
Speaker 1: No, I think Evangelion, you know, it's great, but it's not the best because it just you know, it's not accessible.

434
00:30:18,922 --> 00:30:21,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I guess it's the best you need to have everything.

435
00:30:21,882 --> 00:30:23,709
Speaker 0: I guess I can agree in any area.

436
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:26,399
Speaker 1: if you if you're min-maxing you can't possibly be the best.

437
00:30:27,021 --> 00:30:31,610
Speaker 0: All right, then how about eska flown a which I think is very much up there even slightly higher than Ava?

438
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,944
Speaker 1: No, not really.

439
00:30:34,345 --> 00:30:39,380
Speaker 1: It doesn't really because it's just a. it's just a really really good, you know fantasy anime.

440
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,699
Speaker 1: It doesn't have any amazingness that would make it, you know the best.

441
00:30:43,681 --> 00:30:48,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, see part of it might be that I saw eska flown a a long time ago, but I've seen it again recently.

442
00:30:48,661 --> 00:30:53,280
Speaker 0: I still love it, but cowboy bebop is looking for another watching sometime soon.

443
00:30:53,681 --> 00:30:58,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can watch it like it's one of the it happens to be the best but you can also watch it a thousand times.

444
00:30:59,002 --> 00:31:00,735
Speaker 0: I remember one time our friend Pete was over.

445
00:31:00,755 --> 00:31:08,800
Speaker 0: I think it was Pete me I forget who it was and We were gonna watch like the first five episodes of cowboy bebop because he'd never seen it and we ended up watching the whole show.

446
00:31:09,302 --> 00:31:10,266
Speaker 0: Alex might have been Ali.

447
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:10,848
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

448
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:11,853
Speaker 0: that was a long time ago.

449
00:31:11,873 --> 00:31:13,058
Speaker 1: Yeah, we ended up just watching the whole.

450
00:31:13,078 --> 00:31:13,580
Speaker 1: we couldn't stop.

451
00:31:13,942 --> 00:31:16,035
Speaker 0: Yeah, we just watched the whole show over the course of a weekend.

452
00:31:16,056 --> 00:31:17,784
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Yeah, it's a show.

453
00:31:17,825 --> 00:31:19,211
Speaker 1: you really once you see one episode.

454
00:31:19,231 --> 00:31:21,400
Speaker 1: if you have the rest of them there is just dangerous weapon.

455
00:31:21,957 --> 00:31:37,309
Speaker 0: well I guess one test that seems to really show in terms of cowboy bebop is that I gave cowboy bebop to my dad and he Loved it and I've lent it to people who hate anime never heard of anime don't care about it, whatever and Without exception they've all loved it.

456
00:31:37,952 --> 00:31:39,399
Speaker 0: Yeah, they've all wanted to see more.

457
00:31:40,345 --> 00:31:43,062
Speaker 1: That's what's so terrific about it All right.

458
00:31:43,122 --> 00:31:46,372
Speaker 1: Anyway, my favorite anime not the best anime.

459
00:31:46,632 --> 00:31:47,013
Speaker 1: Actually.

460
00:31:47,154 --> 00:31:52,715
Speaker 1: I'm not even gonna argue that they're the best anime are probably the original macross

461
00:31:53,198 --> 00:31:53,379
Speaker 0: and

462
00:31:55,002 --> 00:31:57,478
Speaker 1: Maybe I don't want to say initial D, but I think I might

463
00:31:58,982 --> 00:32:05,479
Speaker 0: See to me initial D at least the first season and the movie because the rest of the show I'm really losing interest real fast.

464
00:32:06,461 --> 00:32:11,120
Speaker 0: But I love it, but I listed as one of those shows that I know it's dumb, but I love it.

465
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,591
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah initial D.

466
00:32:12,632 --> 00:32:13,660
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna say it's good.

467
00:32:13,881 --> 00:32:18,720
Speaker 1: I mean if you're gonna argue about the best anime, it wouldn't even get on to any of anyone's list.

468
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,983
Speaker 0: It's definitely on the B list.

469
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:25,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe even the C list, but I just can't watch it without feeling really really good.

470
00:32:26,281 --> 00:32:31,580
Speaker 0: I think that's a side effect of one the eurobeat music which we had never experienced before until we saw this show.

471
00:32:32,022 --> 00:32:37,953
Speaker 1: But I mean I've why I've watched all of initial D Maybe five times at least the first season at least five times.

472
00:32:37,993 --> 00:32:41,423
Speaker 1: He's not exaggerating and he was not Every time.

473
00:32:41,443 --> 00:32:42,327
Speaker 1: and it's to.

474
00:32:42,407 --> 00:32:45,980
Speaker 1: even if I watch an episode I've seen before it's still exciting.

475
00:32:46,443 --> 00:32:48,880
Speaker 1: I get I still getting the manga and it's still exciting.

476
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:53,254
Speaker 0: You should see how many inside jokes we have that are based solely on initial D.

477
00:32:53,636 --> 00:32:54,759
Speaker 1: It's just so much fun.

478
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:56,520
Speaker 0: I mean, here's an example.

479
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:01,240
Speaker 0: There's a scene later on in the show where he's talking me the main characters racing some guy, right?

480
00:33:01,662 --> 00:33:04,917
Speaker 0: Which yeah, you never expect that in initial D a show about racing.

481
00:33:05,098 --> 00:33:13,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, and suddenly talking me passes this guy and the guy turns and sees talking me there and he has this look on his face.

482
00:33:13,439 --> 00:33:15,203
Speaker 0: and Now we make this.

483
00:33:15,283 --> 00:33:20,180
Speaker 0: we make the look to each other whenever we see someone failing or whenever we're about to fail at something.

484
00:33:20,642 --> 00:33:22,792
Speaker 1: Yep, it's like up you make the face.

485
00:33:22,812 --> 00:33:29,634
Speaker 0: I Guess part of the reason we really like it is that initial D. when we first saw it We thought it was the stupidest thing ever.

486
00:33:29,816 --> 00:33:33,086
Speaker 1: Oh my god I went to a club Watch four episodes of it.

487
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:34,532
Speaker 1: the first four and at the first.

488
00:33:34,572 --> 00:33:39,280
Speaker 1: the fourth episode is a cliffhanger because you don't know who's gonna win The race and I remember we all walked out like that was the dumbest thing.

489
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:45,319
Speaker 1: I walked out and I actually thought that was really dumb, you know, and I also thought I wonder who wins.

490
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:53,520
Speaker 1: But at the same because I haven't seen any initial D I don't know who that the same guy wins every time and we kept kind of talking about it like yeah that show sucks.

491
00:33:53,681 --> 00:33:57,520
Speaker 1: But I didn't you know, I definitely had a bad opinion of it after watching four episodes.

492
00:33:57,942 --> 00:34:01,017
Speaker 1: It's like I must have not heard the Eurobeat music or something.

493
00:34:01,238 --> 00:34:05,899
Speaker 1: I don't know yeah, so then we then we went and there was a marathon of the whole first season.

494
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,875
Speaker 0: and We went because we figured we'll go and we'll leave after we found out if he wins.

495
00:34:10,996 --> 00:34:13,304
Speaker 0: just because we wanted closure We ended up staying to the end.

496
00:34:13,706 --> 00:34:13,928
Speaker 1: Yep.

497
00:34:14,007 --> 00:34:23,940
Speaker 1: I mean when I went in for that marathon of the whole first season It's like there was a lot quieter in the room so I can concentrate and I can really absorb all the stuff that was going.

498
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:25,485
Speaker 1: You had to get into it.

499
00:34:25,626 --> 00:34:31,005
Speaker 1: if you just kind of casually watch initial D you'll think it's this boring What the hell's going on stupidity.

500
00:34:31,146 --> 00:34:35,300
Speaker 0: or if you expect any sort of deep meaning from this show, you're gonna be disappointed.

501
00:34:35,442 --> 00:34:36,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're gonna be real disappointed.

502
00:34:37,481 --> 00:34:44,951
Speaker 1: But if you sit there and watch initial D and you get into it and you feel the energy It's so much fun.

503
00:34:44,971 --> 00:34:45,678
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

504
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, the best way to do it like a thousand times I guess my advice is never watch initial D alone.

505
00:34:50,641 --> 00:34:52,929
Speaker 0: The more people you have in the room the better.

506
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:56,685
Speaker 0: even people that hate the show because everyone will be yelling by the end of An episode.

507
00:34:56,705 --> 00:34:57,129
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

508
00:34:57,674 --> 00:34:58,299
Speaker 1: That's what it's about.

509
00:34:59,026 --> 00:35:08,969
Speaker 0: Now for me, like I already said irresponsible captain Tyler which is one of the first anime I watched all the way through and For reasons, I really can't really describe.

510
00:35:09,029 --> 00:35:10,133
Speaker 0: I just love that show.

511
00:35:10,153 --> 00:35:11,478
Speaker 0: It's funny.

512
00:35:11,518 --> 00:35:11,960
Speaker 0: It's cute.

513
00:35:12,563 --> 00:35:13,971
Speaker 0: The end made me cry a little bit.

514
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:15,419
Speaker 0: the movie made me cry even more.

515
00:35:16,162 --> 00:35:22,267
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't cry at the end of initial D and I guess part of the reason I really like Tyler is that for anyone Who knows me?

516
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:27,720
Speaker 0: Uh If a person like Tyler existed, they would be my role model hero and God.

517
00:35:28,801 --> 00:35:30,164
Speaker 1: Yeah, that makes sense.

518
00:35:30,546 --> 00:35:33,735
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't really plan at all into the future.

519
00:35:34,236 --> 00:35:35,660
Speaker 0: I'm generally very happy-go-lucky.

520
00:35:35,741 --> 00:35:40,136
Speaker 0: I tend to just leave everything to chance and Tyler is I guess the epitome of that.

521
00:35:41,341 --> 00:35:42,484
Speaker 0: Plus in the show.

522
00:35:43,186 --> 00:35:44,710
Speaker 0: he this is kind of us in a side.

523
00:35:45,111 --> 00:35:47,940
Speaker 0: He ends up with this alien princess girl who?

524
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,424
Speaker 0: Ironically enough.

525
00:35:49,666 --> 00:35:50,633
Speaker 0: I guess not ironically.

526
00:35:50,693 --> 00:35:55,693
Speaker 0: just coincidentally I Dated in college a girl who looked almost exactly like her.

527
00:35:56,034 --> 00:35:57,440
Speaker 1: you dated an alien princess.

528
00:35:58,183 --> 00:36:02,963
Speaker 0: Well, I'll note that the alien princess actually just looked like a normal redheaded girl Mm-hmm.

529
00:36:03,124 --> 00:36:06,395
Speaker 1: So rim has a personal connection with the show and thus making it his favorite.

530
00:36:06,555 --> 00:36:13,492
Speaker 0: I Have no personal connection at all with initial D Other than the fact that you tend to drive fast and or recklessly at times.

531
00:36:13,874 --> 00:36:20,219
Speaker 1: No, not really But they don't really drive recklessly and initially there's many wrecks.

532
00:36:20,962 --> 00:36:22,607
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're not less right now, of course.

533
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:26,059
Speaker 0: I could also give an equally important nod to shoujo kakumei.

534
00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:32,287
Speaker 0: utenna Yeah, which we a bunch of us watch together for a while Mm-hmm.

535
00:36:32,692 --> 00:36:36,780
Speaker 1: I mean Utenna is a good show, but it's kind of crazy.

536
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:44,439
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it's got some aspects of it I like a whole lot and other aspects are just kind of like and I'd rather have just that part of the show.

537
00:36:44,741 --> 00:36:47,399
Speaker 0: Watching utenna is like reading Hawthorne.

538
00:36:47,961 --> 00:36:56,003
Speaker 0: Every single sentence is just a metaphor metaphor metaphor metaphor metaphor to the point that you're barely aware of the fact that there's a show Happening around it.

539
00:36:56,605 --> 00:37:13,789
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that part of the problem with utenna is that a lot of the times imagine if You just someone's blatantly doing things that are supposed to be symbolic like they're just throwing symbols at you but a lot of them just represent nothing or they're just Symbols for the sake of making symbols

540
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:16,159
Speaker 0: see very few of them actually mean nothing in the show.

541
00:37:16,714 --> 00:37:25,480
Speaker 1: Yeah I think because no matter what symbol if I made a show that was just a bunch of symbols Someone out there could come up with a meaning for every single one of them no matter what the plot was.

542
00:37:25,901 --> 00:37:28,592
Speaker 0: I think most of this part that you're referring to is from the.

543
00:37:29,033 --> 00:37:39,780
Speaker 0: there's a part in the black rose saga Which is in the middle of the show Where it the show seems to make fun of itself and they start throw it like absolutely ridiculous metaphors all over the place.

544
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,373
Speaker 1: Well, that's one particular the point that there's.

545
00:37:41,474 --> 00:37:50,274
Speaker 0: even at one point There's like it shows something and then there's a hand that appears on the screen Pointing at it to draw your attention to it to remind you that it's symbolic of something.

546
00:37:50,655 --> 00:37:51,960
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, which was just silly.

547
00:37:52,622 --> 00:37:53,204
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's just.

548
00:37:53,264 --> 00:37:54,930
Speaker 1: that's one part in like one episode.

549
00:37:54,971 --> 00:37:57,540
Speaker 1: but in general the show does all kinds of stuff.

550
00:37:57,741 --> 00:38:01,132
Speaker 1: You know whether some of it means something some of it doesn't.

551
00:38:01,213 --> 00:38:08,034
Speaker 1: some of it you can make mean something like Nikki in the stopwatch thing and oh, no, that's specifically not supposed to mean anything.

552
00:38:08,175 --> 00:38:19,059
Speaker 1: Yeah, you see what I'm talking about Mickey's just an anal kind of little person Yeah, and like people always lie when they're meeting in places and they'll have the shows over dramatic.

553
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:20,993
Speaker 0: All right All right, here's how I like it.

554
00:38:21,053 --> 00:38:27,420
Speaker 1: on very prurient level It's most of the symbols are just weird accessories in scenes that they draw attention to frequently.

555
00:38:28,323 --> 00:38:30,020
Speaker 0: See, I think that there's a lot more.

556
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,138
Speaker 0: I think that there was a lot of thought put into what was shown where and when.

557
00:38:33,158 --> 00:38:35,450
Speaker 1: oh Yeah, there might have been thought to it.

558
00:38:35,692 --> 00:38:37,963
Speaker 1: It was crazy thought But it was.

559
00:38:38,043 --> 00:38:40,373
Speaker 1: you know, it doesn't matter whether the thought was there or not.

560
00:38:40,414 --> 00:38:40,735
Speaker 1: the point.

561
00:38:40,795 --> 00:38:47,595
Speaker 0: on a very basic level I like the show because it's got the tall thin pretty angular people and rose petals flying everywhere.

562
00:38:47,936 --> 00:38:49,640
Speaker 0: Everything's overdramatic and crazy.

563
00:38:50,281 --> 00:38:55,076
Speaker 0: Everyone is just really really Anime, I guess is a one way to put it.

564
00:38:56,062 --> 00:39:06,274
Speaker 0: Yeah, and honestly what I really like about the show is just that Once you see the end and you figure out what's going on because the show is kind of weird You go watch the show all over again.

565
00:39:06,314 --> 00:39:06,940
Speaker 1: It's totally different.

566
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:13,689
Speaker 0: Yeah, watching the show the second time through this is one of those shows where once you realize what's going on Every every single thing in the show is different.

567
00:39:13,709 --> 00:39:19,389
Speaker 0: now because you watch it again and you realize wait a minute But in the very first episode that happens because of this.

568
00:39:19,711 --> 00:39:20,413
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

569
00:39:20,613 --> 00:39:21,195
Speaker 0: I get it.

570
00:39:21,436 --> 00:39:21,918
Speaker 0: Oh, man.

571
00:39:21,938 --> 00:39:22,620
Speaker 0: This is crazy.

572
00:39:22,881 --> 00:39:33,883
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like when we first I didn't figure it out until like two minutes before the end Yeah, and I didn't open like I had it in my brain and I should have said something because then people would have been like Oh Scott got it.

573
00:39:33,924 --> 00:39:35,088
Speaker 1: But no, I didn't say anything.

574
00:39:35,128 --> 00:39:36,473
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz not a shit talker.

575
00:39:36,533 --> 00:39:39,711
Speaker 1: I Could be lying, but I'm not.

576
00:39:40,135 --> 00:39:40,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, I figured.

577
00:39:41,641 --> 00:39:42,606
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it's.

578
00:39:42,687 --> 00:39:45,280
Speaker 0: it's one of the few shows where we were all watching it together.

579
00:39:45,862 --> 00:39:49,960
Speaker 0: And there's a point in the show at the end where quite literally we all screamed.

580
00:39:50,942 --> 00:39:53,256
Speaker 0: It takes a lot to make me scream during a show.

581
00:39:53,276 --> 00:39:55,166
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm I mean I've cried.

582
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:57,600
Speaker 0: I'll admit that I cry like a girl and a lot of anime.

583
00:39:57,881 --> 00:39:59,771
Speaker 1: I used to cry at a lot of stuff but not anymore.

584
00:39:59,811 --> 00:40:01,600
Speaker 0: Really I cry like a little girl.

585
00:40:02,223 --> 00:40:05,040
Speaker 0: I just start bawling sometimes I try to hold it in just doesn't work.

586
00:40:05,502 --> 00:40:07,592
Speaker 0: I just I cry but I don't scream.

587
00:40:07,753 --> 00:40:08,919
Speaker 0: and utenna made me scream.

588
00:40:10,081 --> 00:40:14,737
Speaker 0: Yep, well, we could list all the shows we've cried at the end of no because I can't really remember.

589
00:40:14,757 --> 00:40:15,038
Speaker 1: try gun.

590
00:40:16,162 --> 00:40:17,589
Speaker 1: Yeah, kinda yeah you cried.

591
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:21,503
Speaker 1: we all cry more in like 23 than 26.

592
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:23,012
Speaker 0: yeah, 26.

593
00:40:23,012 --> 00:40:23,515
Speaker 0: See try gun.

594
00:40:23,535 --> 00:40:24,360
Speaker 0: I think is a really good shot.

595
00:40:24,441 --> 00:40:33,386
Speaker 1: Definitely wouldn't call it the best or my favorite but it's very high on my list if try gonna continued more in the vein of the first few episodes instead of it kind of Changed a little towards the end.

596
00:40:33,426 --> 00:40:36,400
Speaker 1: It would have been a much better more favorite show.

597
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:42,120
Speaker 0: See, I don't know because the first few episodes were just silly and then later it had, you know plot meaning character development.

598
00:40:42,582 --> 00:40:43,626
Speaker 1: Yeah, you should read the manga.

599
00:40:44,148 --> 00:40:45,452
Speaker 0: the manga makes no sense.

600
00:40:45,854 --> 00:40:47,480
Speaker 0: the manga is just crazy batshit.

601
00:40:47,881 --> 00:40:49,125
Speaker 0: I can't follow the manga.

602
00:40:49,406 --> 00:40:53,479
Speaker 0: if I had not already seen the show the manga would be entirely indecipherable to me.

603
00:40:54,242 --> 00:40:55,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, the manga doesn't really create.

604
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,698
Speaker 1: the guy draws really action scenes.

605
00:40:57,759 --> 00:41:04,380
Speaker 1: Well He's like a hammer trying to whack all the nails and also the screws and the bolts and the nuts.

606
00:41:04,782 --> 00:41:05,646
Speaker 0: I just can't follow it.

607
00:41:05,706 --> 00:41:08,560
Speaker 0: I'd like to because I want to know more about these characters in this world.

608
00:41:08,761 --> 00:41:11,340
Speaker 1: Oh, I kind of know but maybe I'll explain it someday.

609
00:41:11,681 --> 00:41:16,200
Speaker 0: I just can't read that manga and this is coming from a guy who's read Sailor Moon.

610
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:21,279
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you my other favorite anime I said already was Matt the original Macross.

611
00:41:21,339 --> 00:41:26,780
Speaker 1: now I saw Robo tech not when it was shown in the 70s, but when it was shown on Cartoon Network.

612
00:41:27,541 --> 00:41:31,039
Speaker 0: Yeah, I watched much of it then and I didn't know much of what was going on.

613
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:39,485
Speaker 1: Yeah See this is the thing is that was the first show where I was watching Toonami like religiously when Moltar was the guy I miss him.

614
00:41:39,746 --> 00:41:41,552
Speaker 1: Yeah, when they would show Space Ghost and Thunder.

615
00:41:41,592 --> 00:41:43,900
Speaker 1: That's why I started watching because it's Space Ghost and Thundercats.

616
00:41:44,903 --> 00:41:49,854
Speaker 1: One day they show the show Robo tech and I was like, alright I'll watch the first episode of this show and it was alright.

617
00:41:50,497 --> 00:41:53,738
Speaker 1: and the next day There was another episode and it continued from episode one.

618
00:41:54,702 --> 00:42:01,400
Speaker 1: So I promised myself I wasn't gonna miss any episodes and I managed to make it well into the second story of Robo tech.

619
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:03,505
Speaker 1: You know Which was actually?

620
00:42:03,846 --> 00:42:09,606
Speaker 1: I think it's Southern Cross is the name of the real and because it Robo tech if you don't know It's like three or four animes combined.

621
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:12,495
Speaker 1: They basically put these animes end-to-end.

622
00:42:12,575 --> 00:42:22,599
Speaker 1: So the first anime is Macross Southern Cross and Genesis Rider Mospita and they put these shows end-to-end Right as if they were one big show.

623
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:29,100
Speaker 1: But really it's three animes stuck together and redubbed and they said that they made a proto culture.

624
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:35,510
Speaker 1: yeah, they took proto culture and they pretended that certain characters are related to other characters to make them stick together.

625
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:41,930
Speaker 1: and Basically if you just watch these three anime separately on their own they're all much better than Robo tech.

626
00:42:42,191 --> 00:42:49,904
Speaker 1: Yes, but when I watched Robo tech for the first time I realized that the show had changed and I learned that they were actually separate shows.

627
00:42:50,345 --> 00:42:55,578
Speaker 1: and the first show is Macross and like Back this is so long ago.

628
00:42:55,598 --> 00:42:59,401
Speaker 1: I was still crying at the end of anime, but I didn't really cry but it was just like at the end.

629
00:42:59,461 --> 00:43:04,989
Speaker 1: I was like Yeah, yeah Macross is a good show cuz I watched the whole thing through.

630
00:43:05,009 --> 00:43:08,390
Speaker 0: well He bought that crazy box set that came out way back in the day.

631
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:13,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, so then I watched started watching the second show and I watched the second show through to the end.

632
00:43:13,892 --> 00:43:18,150
Speaker 1: But it didn't really quite give the odd because I think it was destroyed too much by its Robo tech a vacation.

633
00:43:18,472 --> 00:43:19,944
Speaker 1: So Southern Cross, I'm sorry.

634
00:43:20,024 --> 00:43:20,649
Speaker 1: You're not so good.

635
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:26,950
Speaker 1: I never actually saw the third one because Cartoon Network didn't air it and I don't know where to find it.

636
00:43:27,131 --> 00:43:29,070
Speaker 1: I'm sure I could get it on DVD now, but whatever.

637
00:43:30,031 --> 00:43:42,910
Speaker 1: But then when I got the the box set which is I think sophomore year college Yeah, we were gonna make that took all of the original of Macross the original on Robo tech a fine version.

638
00:43:43,353 --> 00:43:49,723
Speaker 1: They read they up to the graphics so they were visible and they added subtitles instead of dubbing.

639
00:43:49,743 --> 00:43:52,170
Speaker 1: and you watch that and it's like.

640
00:43:53,514 --> 00:43:55,309
Speaker 1: And then I could really see what the hell was going on.

641
00:43:56,432 --> 00:43:57,234
Speaker 1: And it's hella good.

642
00:43:57,957 --> 00:43:58,097
Speaker 1: it's.

643
00:43:58,539 --> 00:43:58,700
Speaker 1: it's.

644
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,165
Speaker 1: let's see what's so great about it.

645
00:44:00,265 --> 00:44:03,957
Speaker 1: number one, it's got awesome robots But it's robots that make sense.

646
00:44:03,997 --> 00:44:07,548
Speaker 1: It's not like crazy condoms with super attacks or anything.

647
00:44:07,608 --> 00:44:16,710
Speaker 1: It's like Imagine if we had military technology, you know a hundred years from now It's definitely gassaraki robots as opposed to big O robots.

648
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:23,470
Speaker 1: Yeah Imagine if like we had some alien technology that we learned stuff from and we advanced far into the future from now.

649
00:44:24,213 --> 00:44:25,099
Speaker 1: It's like fighter jets.

650
00:44:25,139 --> 00:44:27,050
Speaker 1: Well, our fighter jets would transform into robots.

651
00:44:27,211 --> 00:44:27,694
Speaker 1: It makes sense.

652
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,009
Speaker 1: and the fighter jets in the show?

653
00:44:30,451 --> 00:44:35,510
Speaker 1: The story is that one of the guys working on the show actually said what if we had a plane that turned into a robot?

654
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:36,312
Speaker 1: That would be awesome.

655
00:44:36,653 --> 00:44:38,078
Speaker 1: And everyone was like what you're crazy.

656
00:44:38,479 --> 00:44:42,090
Speaker 1: So then he made the toy first and the toys so high quality.

657
00:44:42,852 --> 00:44:46,590
Speaker 1: So then they just made the show look exactly like the toy and it makes perfect sense.

658
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:49,017
Speaker 0: Didn't the toy come first in big O as well.

659
00:44:49,037 --> 00:45:02,010
Speaker 0: I I remember reading something like the guy made the toy to try to pimp his show idea.

660
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:09,949
Speaker 0: You know the big O robot and all I remember the very funny part was that the people he showed the toy to asked him Why the hell does he have interchangeable fists?

661
00:45:12,753 --> 00:45:18,625
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's good one No, but then macross also has the great music.

662
00:45:18,745 --> 00:45:23,146
Speaker 1: even the dubbed Robotech has awesome music and the thing about it.

663
00:45:23,206 --> 00:45:26,898
Speaker 1: It's not like The music isn't like music in other shows.

664
00:45:27,038 --> 00:45:40,280
Speaker 1: It's classy sort of show tune pop tune type of things that min may sings and they're all really like no matter what Set decade you're in no matter what the music style of the times is.

665
00:45:40,842 --> 00:45:45,355
Speaker 1: if you watch this show the song is kind of grow Like they play the same.

666
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:58,609
Speaker 1: you'll hear her sing the same song and like every single episode and she has about maybe ten songs at most probably less than that, but they all grow on you and you recognize them and it's like And you begin to associate them in your mind with different things going on.

667
00:45:59,731 --> 00:46:03,186
Speaker 1: It's just really good and the space battles don't have too much stock footage.

668
00:46:03,588 --> 00:46:03,990
Speaker 0: No, no.

669
00:46:05,751 --> 00:46:16,127
Speaker 0: Now another show that's near and dear to me though people often make fun of me and I have good reasons for this show Being as good to me as it is or as I'm going to claim it is Sailor Moon.

670
00:46:16,853 --> 00:46:22,936
Speaker 1: So in one sec, I've seen all 200 episodes and all the movies and I'm gonna be proud of.

671
00:46:23,056 --> 00:46:24,622
Speaker 0: well, the thing is way back.

672
00:46:24,663 --> 00:46:30,282
Speaker 0: there wasn't so much anime I can get my hands on and I found this fan subber and I ended up.

673
00:46:30,302 --> 00:46:32,110
Speaker 0: these are like this is back before they were digi subs.

674
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:33,335
Speaker 0: Like you couldn't get fan subs.

675
00:46:34,058 --> 00:46:37,050
Speaker 0: So I got all these VHS fan subs of Sailor Moon.

676
00:46:37,491 --> 00:46:40,379
Speaker 0: It was like the first non American released anime I'd ever seen.

677
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:49,615
Speaker 0: so being the anime fan that I was I sat down and watched it And I gotta say of all the magical girl shows out there.

678
00:46:49,636 --> 00:46:59,099
Speaker 0: I think Sailor Moon is still probably the definitive one and If you cut out about a hundred and seventy five of those episodes I really think there's a good plot there.

679
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:10,879
Speaker 1: if you cut out a hundred and seventy five episodes Maybe I mean if you want to just compare based on quality and enjoyment I don't think you can really say that Sailor Moon is better than fancy Lala.

680
00:47:10,899 --> 00:47:19,610
Speaker 0: I Sailor Moon has a hurricane michiro, which I think who I think are awesome.

681
00:47:20,435 --> 00:47:37,849
Speaker 0: I don't know what the hell that is actually, it has the Sailor Moon s because it's broken up into different story, you know, yeah and Sailor Moon s. if any of you have never seen any of Sailor Moon and you want to see kind of not really the origin But like the defining magical girl show watch Sailor Moon s from start to finish.

682
00:47:38,991 --> 00:47:39,895
Speaker 0: That is in my eyes.

683
00:47:39,956 --> 00:47:41,362
Speaker 0: What is magical girl show should be?

684
00:47:41,583 --> 00:47:42,970
Speaker 1: is that the one they kept out of American?

685
00:47:43,753 --> 00:47:44,274
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was that.

686
00:47:44,355 --> 00:47:58,933
Speaker 0: that was right at the point because they were showing Sailor Moon in America to little kids and they were dubbing it and changing it and then they got to Sailor Moon s and that's when they realized that this show probably isn't for American kids because Lesbians death.

687
00:47:59,294 --> 00:48:00,418
Speaker 0: Oh my god plot.

688
00:48:00,759 --> 00:48:04,049
Speaker 1: So the lesbian porn part with is what you think a magical girl show should be.

689
00:48:05,153 --> 00:48:07,169
Speaker 1: See, there's actually the last time you watch this.

690
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:11,650
Speaker 0: Actually, the last time I watched it was when I was a senior in high school.

691
00:48:12,391 --> 00:48:17,710
Speaker 1: So are you sure your memory isn't slightly blurred based on your senior in high school wanting to look at Lesbians?

692
00:48:17,751 --> 00:48:25,072
Speaker 0: Oh, no, I'm not saying the show is great I'm just saying that in terms of shows that have affected me or shows that I like there's a place in my heart for Sailor Moon.

693
00:48:25,233 --> 00:48:29,577
Speaker 1: All right, because I think the show is favorites Which means has to be the top of the list.

694
00:48:29,597 --> 00:48:33,573
Speaker 1: because if we're just gonna go based on shows that I like and shows That affected me.

695
00:48:33,593 --> 00:48:34,478
Speaker 1: Well, let's let's see.

696
00:48:34,518 --> 00:48:36,649
Speaker 1: Let's get a little pen and paper out here.

697
00:48:37,133 --> 00:48:44,146
Speaker 0: Well, see if we're talking about favorites, I mean Even if I list every show I've liked that's less than maybe 5% of all the anime out there.

698
00:48:44,427 --> 00:48:45,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's true.

699
00:48:45,971 --> 00:48:49,243
Speaker 1: But if you're gonna talk about just liked at all, we got like Gundam.

700
00:48:49,304 --> 00:48:51,654
Speaker 0: see I like Sailor Moon a lot I mean.

701
00:48:51,694 --> 00:48:54,449
Speaker 0: granted a lot of that is clouded by the fact that I saw it a long time ago.

702
00:48:54,992 --> 00:48:57,926
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm trying to you know, but since it's favorites, I'm trying to stick with stuff.

703
00:48:57,946 --> 00:49:01,364
Speaker 1: That's like, all right Yeah, really say I like that more than I like that.

704
00:49:01,384 --> 00:49:05,502
Speaker 0: Well, like you mentioned Gundam seed I wouldn't even bring it up because I liked it, but I didn't like it that much.

705
00:49:05,863 --> 00:49:10,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know I could really think of stuff that I liked as much as initial D and Macross.

706
00:49:11,091 --> 00:49:17,496
Speaker 1: I could think of stuff that is as good as and stuff that I liked a lot but not as much I remember in high school.

707
00:49:17,556 --> 00:49:19,966
Speaker 0: I really liked Tenchi Muyo and to this day.

708
00:49:20,026 --> 00:49:23,830
Speaker 0: I still love it though I hate every spin-off and every TV series after the original.

709
00:49:24,164 --> 00:49:32,289
Speaker 0: Well We've been talking mostly about series for a lot of reasons because we tried to think of anime movies that really affected us or we really loved or our favorite movies.

710
00:49:32,389 --> 00:49:34,883
Speaker 0: and It's a lot harder to pick a favorite movie.

711
00:49:34,923 --> 00:49:35,909
Speaker 0: I think than a favorite show.

712
00:49:36,613 --> 00:49:37,014
Speaker 1: I think it's just.

713
00:49:37,035 --> 00:49:42,175
Speaker 1: there's not a lot of quantity of anime movies and a lot of them are like Summary movies and recap movies.

714
00:49:42,215 --> 00:49:47,530
Speaker 0: So you really can't grow movies that are just long episodes like the cowboy bebop movie or all the Sailor Moon movies.

715
00:49:47,891 --> 00:49:52,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I think Ghibli is like, you know overall is the anime movie King?

716
00:49:52,671 --> 00:49:53,795
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think we even need that.

717
00:49:53,835 --> 00:49:57,690
Speaker 0: Well, we'll consider non Ghibli movies because honestly Ghibli movies are just amazing.

718
00:49:57,871 --> 00:50:02,192
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if I had to pick one Ghibli movie, I would just pick spirited away Overall.

719
00:50:02,233 --> 00:50:02,956
Speaker 1: the rest I think.

720
00:50:03,217 --> 00:50:06,270
Speaker 0: for me, I don't know I actually really really liked house moving castle.

721
00:50:06,491 --> 00:50:10,504
Speaker 1: Yeah, I liked it a lot too, but I think spirited away had a few things on it.

722
00:50:10,906 --> 00:50:11,969
Speaker 1: Hmm like little.

723
00:50:11,989 --> 00:50:14,518
Speaker 1: well Let's see house moving castle had the fire.

724
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:19,554
Speaker 1: That's really like a huge trump card right there But it's pretty.

725
00:50:19,574 --> 00:50:24,349
Speaker 1: we had a little footballs and I think the story made a little bit more sense.

726
00:50:25,632 --> 00:50:27,640
Speaker 1: You know stuff like that now.

727
00:50:27,701 --> 00:50:33,030
Speaker 0: honestly if I had to pick my favorite anime movie ever I left a list too because one of them is fairly fairly recent.

728
00:50:33,493 --> 00:50:39,090
Speaker 0: So I want to give a nod to the old movie that I like as well Because the old movie was kind of knocked out of the first place position recently.

729
00:50:40,012 --> 00:50:45,917
Speaker 0: my favorite anime movie prior to the second one is Lupin the third castle of Cagliostro.

730
00:50:45,937 --> 00:50:46,960
Speaker 0: Oh Lupin.

731
00:50:47,321 --> 00:50:48,002
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

732
00:50:48,243 --> 00:50:50,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I love every Lupin movie.

733
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:52,452
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah crappiest crap.

734
00:50:52,492 --> 00:50:59,995
Speaker 0: Lupin movie Babylon gold is on my list of good anime and it's really close between the fuma conspiracy and Cagliostro.

735
00:51:00,035 --> 00:51:02,190
Speaker 0: those are both like the prime of Lupin.

736
00:51:02,732 --> 00:51:06,809
Speaker 0: But I think Cagliostro edges out just a little bit just because of the scene at the end.

737
00:51:07,612 --> 00:51:11,729
Speaker 0: Not gonna spoil anything, but the last scene in that movie just brings a little man tear to your eye.

738
00:51:12,612 --> 00:51:25,758
Speaker 1: Yeah, Cagliostro is real good and I really like Lupin, but I think fuma conspiracy I like more because Cagliostro is like just missing some of those like Lupin Elements that all the other Lupin movies have.

739
00:51:26,039 --> 00:51:27,885
Speaker 0: well Cagliostro was a little more serious.

740
00:51:28,186 --> 00:51:35,768
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was more serious And you know while more serious, I think makes it a better movie It doesn't make it a more favorite movie of mine, you know.

741
00:51:36,612 --> 00:51:40,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can see where you're coming from and I got to admit this isn't a spoiler because it happens immediately.

742
00:51:41,492 --> 00:51:44,722
Speaker 0: Fuma conspiracy the main thing going on in that movie.

743
00:51:44,762 --> 00:51:47,070
Speaker 0: Is that going on gets married?

744
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:50,129
Speaker 0: If you don't know who going on is that doesn't mean anything to you.

745
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:54,245
Speaker 1: But if you do if you don't know who go mine is why haven't you seen a new upon?

746
00:51:54,606 --> 00:51:55,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll talk to us.

747
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:56,695
Speaker 0: We'll give you some movies.

748
00:51:56,795 --> 00:51:57,358
Speaker 0: I mean Dan.

749
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:04,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, you need to see every Lupin movie and Probably the TV show as much as you can and at least the movies.

750
00:52:04,471 --> 00:52:05,990
Speaker 0: I think the movies are better than the TV show.

751
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:11,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, the movies are where it's at and even if you hate Lupin Castle Cagliostro is an amazing movie.

752
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:12,581
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, if you don't.

753
00:52:12,722 --> 00:52:17,010
Speaker 1: even if you don't like Lupin Cagliostro, like I said doesn't have all the Lupin things in it.

754
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:18,416
Speaker 1: It's more serious and whatever.

755
00:52:18,497 --> 00:52:30,786
Speaker 0: so plus it has one of the best lines in any show ever With your sword and my anti-tank rifle, yep dot dot dot Yep, but I got to say both movies were edged out recently by the place promised in our early days.

756
00:52:30,806 --> 00:52:32,454
Speaker 1: I Don't know.

757
00:52:32,474 --> 00:52:34,028
Speaker 1: I don't like police promise that much.

758
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:37,930
Speaker 0: I don't know why the show affected me so much this movie, but I just loved it.

759
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:38,532
Speaker 0: It was just.

760
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:42,006
Speaker 0: this movie has the saddest happy moment.

761
00:52:42,086 --> 00:52:42,849
Speaker 0: I've ever seen.

762
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:45,279
Speaker 0: Imagine a scene where nothing bad happens.

763
00:52:45,339 --> 00:52:47,869
Speaker 0: In fact only good things happen, but it's still sad.

764
00:52:49,271 --> 00:52:56,215
Speaker 0: Yeah, it did have that and I just think it was generally a very good atmospheric Well-drawn well-done movie.

765
00:52:56,836 --> 00:52:57,077
Speaker 1: Yep.

766
00:52:57,157 --> 00:52:57,959
Speaker 1: It was all those things.

767
00:52:58,581 --> 00:52:59,122
Speaker 1: I won't deny.

768
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:00,586
Speaker 1: All right, so I just didn't.

769
00:53:00,606 --> 00:53:05,203
Speaker 1: I Know I actually liked the other work by the same guy.

770
00:53:05,243 --> 00:53:05,685
Speaker 1: What was it?

771
00:53:06,106 --> 00:53:06,950
Speaker 0: Oh a Hoshi no Koi.

772
00:53:07,091 --> 00:53:09,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like that a lot more and it wasn't even a whole movie.

773
00:53:09,411 --> 00:53:11,910
Speaker 0: See I like that one, but I liked it a lot less than this one.

774
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:16,196
Speaker 1: No, I liked Hoshi no Koi the most this one because I'd seen Hoshi no Koi.

775
00:53:16,236 --> 00:53:22,935
Speaker 1: a lot of this was Hoshi no Koi ish You know, it just seemed a little more Slower and dragged out.

776
00:53:23,015 --> 00:53:25,222
Speaker 0: and see what were you say slower and dragged out.

777
00:53:25,383 --> 00:53:30,149
Speaker 1: I say atmospheric and yeah That's all point of view type of thing.

778
00:53:30,379 --> 00:53:31,754
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean we have different tastes.

779
00:53:32,035 --> 00:53:37,093
Speaker 0: Scott likes the giant robots a lot more than me and I like the show Joe crap as he Would call it.

780
00:53:37,435 --> 00:53:40,050
Speaker 1: I don't like the giant robots because they're giant robots.

781
00:53:40,471 --> 00:53:46,310
Speaker 0: Shows that have giant robots happen to have be the type that you don't like giant robo, which I think is awesome.

782
00:53:46,652 --> 00:53:47,338
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't like it.

783
00:53:47,761 --> 00:53:48,829
Speaker 0: I don't it's awesome.

784
00:53:49,472 --> 00:53:50,274
Speaker 1: No, it's like.

785
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:55,030
Speaker 1: giant robo is a lot more like Astro Boy than it is like other than macross or anything.

786
00:53:55,271 --> 00:53:57,778
Speaker 1: All right, it just happens to have giant robots.

787
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:59,805
Speaker 0: All right, so I've listed place promised.

788
00:53:59,825 --> 00:54:01,410
Speaker 0: What's your favorite non-loupon?

789
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:02,193
Speaker 0: Animated movie.

790
00:54:02,354 --> 00:54:03,784
Speaker 1: I'm the part anime movie.

791
00:54:03,904 --> 00:54:04,529
Speaker 1: Oh, it's real hard.

792
00:54:05,373 --> 00:54:07,622
Speaker 1: The Pat LeBourne movies are really really good.

793
00:54:07,843 --> 00:54:09,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't like him that much but they're good.

794
00:54:09,731 --> 00:54:16,520
Speaker 1: I think the second one is the best one and I mean well Akira is really good.

795
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:19,330
Speaker 1: But once you read the manga, it doesn't feel so good anymore.

796
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:23,490
Speaker 1: It's like when I saw Akira before and I'd only seen a few other anime movies.

797
00:54:24,253 --> 00:54:28,550
Speaker 1: It was kind of like whoa my god, but then once you read the manga, it's like yeah that movies not so much.

798
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:33,069
Speaker 1: Yep, now the beginning of the movie beginning the first half of Akira is the best anime movie.

799
00:54:34,336 --> 00:54:39,830
Speaker 1: The second half The second half of the Akira movie is not the best anime movie ever.

800
00:54:40,132 --> 00:54:42,290
Speaker 0: I gotta give a big nod to the ghost in the shell movies.

801
00:54:42,591 --> 00:54:46,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, because they I mean one goes to the first one a lot more than the second one.

802
00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:48,741
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like the second one a lot for a lot of reasons.

803
00:54:48,761 --> 00:54:49,685
Speaker 0: I mean, it was really pretty.

804
00:54:49,705 --> 00:54:55,503
Speaker 0: it got me For any of you who have seen it that scene where you thought the movie was broken.

805
00:54:56,205 --> 00:54:56,827
Speaker 0: that got me.

806
00:54:57,148 --> 00:55:01,923
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I liked seeing a lot like just kind of a look into Bato's life.

807
00:55:01,943 --> 00:55:02,486
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

808
00:55:02,847 --> 00:55:03,510
Speaker 0: I like that a lot.

809
00:55:03,791 --> 00:55:06,521
Speaker 1: Yeah, Bato, it's like the major is just totally.

810
00:55:06,541 --> 00:55:08,790
Speaker 1: if you want to know about her you can read the manga.

811
00:55:09,031 --> 00:55:13,410
Speaker 1: So the fact that they focus on the other characters and the TV show in the movies is awesome.

812
00:55:13,784 --> 00:55:17,243
Speaker 0: Yeah Cuz you see Bato and he's got his dog and he's got his life and it's just.

813
00:55:17,343 --> 00:55:23,670
Speaker 0: I really like that movie and I I guess The two of the ghost in the shell movies together would be very very high in my list as an entity.

814
00:55:23,791 --> 00:55:25,308
Speaker 1: That's got to be a high on anyone's list.

815
00:55:26,931 --> 00:55:28,418
Speaker 1: The Galaxy Express like.

816
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:33,060
Speaker 1: I would have said that was the best but then re-watching it I mean, it's still really good, but I don't it does.

817
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:34,790
Speaker 1: it's not the same as it was before.

818
00:55:35,471 --> 00:55:36,115
Speaker 0: Yeah, though.

819
00:55:36,135 --> 00:55:37,725
Speaker 0: We're watching a lot of that stuff now.

820
00:55:37,745 --> 00:55:44,079
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like my memory of watching the ghost in the Galaxy Express movie the first time would be like the best.

821
00:55:44,179 --> 00:55:47,700
Speaker 0: but oh Yeah, that completely chart.

822
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,750
Speaker 0: because I said place promised and Lupin movies.

823
00:55:50,071 --> 00:55:52,101
Speaker 0: But there's one other anime movie that like it.

824
00:55:52,322 --> 00:55:53,528
Speaker 0: it's tied with all of them.

825
00:55:53,568 --> 00:55:56,239
Speaker 0: to me It's eraser at Sura to beautiful.

826
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,444
Speaker 1: Oh, you like that one.

827
00:55:57,745 --> 00:55:58,910
Speaker 0: Well, I like you're a say at Sura.

828
00:55:59,233 --> 00:56:00,489
Speaker 0: I just think it's cute and funny.

829
00:56:00,913 --> 00:56:03,050
Speaker 0: But the thing is for anyone doesn't know the story and I'll be real brief.

830
00:56:03,572 --> 00:56:08,330
Speaker 0: The second movie there are five or six movies and the second movie was done by different people.

831
00:56:08,713 --> 00:56:10,670
Speaker 0: In fact, it got licensed by a different company.

832
00:56:11,071 --> 00:56:21,143
Speaker 0: So you can buy a box set that has one three four five six and then you can buy two by itself and there's a hole To stick it in in the other box Mm-hmm, and I guess it is.

833
00:56:21,263 --> 00:56:26,129
Speaker 0: it is just a very good Screen representation of how dreams work.

834
00:56:27,296 --> 00:56:38,181
Speaker 0: That may sound weird But it's a good movie like a really good movie and I saw it on the sci-fi channel way way back and to this day I still consider it one of my favorite movies ever animated or otherwise.

835
00:56:38,582 --> 00:56:38,783
Speaker 0: Yeah.

836
00:56:39,364 --> 00:56:41,571
Speaker 1: Well, you also like that whatever tenchi movie It was.

837
00:56:41,591 --> 00:56:47,775
Speaker 0: I like the first tenchi movie tenchi muyo in love because it's just cute funny happy whatever You know.

838
00:56:47,835 --> 00:56:49,746
Speaker 1: early watch and I watched it.

839
00:56:49,826 --> 00:56:50,309
Speaker 1: It was lame.

840
00:56:51,232 --> 00:56:53,970
Speaker 0: No, that was the second one I had you watch because it's only an hour long.

841

Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

842

00:57:00,839 --> 00:57:03,390

850
00:57:19,898 --> 00:57:22,510

851
00:57:22,791 --> 00:57:25,480
Speaker 1: No, the problem is when that type of show is a nasty harem show.

Speaker 0: I thought it was funny and generally heartwarming.

853
