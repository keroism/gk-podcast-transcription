1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:13,328
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, November 2nd, 2016.

2
00:00:13,328 --> 00:00:18,456
Speaker 0: I'm Rym, and this is Geek Nights Tonight, the adventures of Ichabod and Mr.

3
00:00:18,496 --> 00:00:20,499
Speaker 0: Toad, except we're not actually going to talk about the Mr.

4
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:20,940
Speaker 0: Toad part.

5
00:00:23,361 --> 00:00:24,358
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,479
Speaker 0: So Scott has some part season tickets to the Rangers, and he brought me along to- Part season.

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,382
Speaker 0: Yup.

8
00:00:34,449 --> 00:00:36,119
Speaker 0: Rangers tickets are fucking expensive kids.

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,551
Speaker 0: So I went to a game, and it was a good hockey game, all told.

10
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:41,674
Speaker 0: We shut out the St.

11
00:00:41,694 --> 00:00:42,296
Speaker 0: Louis Blues.

12
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:43,299
Speaker 0: It was kind of awful for them.

13
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:53,020
Speaker 0: But what was notable is that during the game, they interrupted, like during an stoppage of play, to be like, "Hey guys, guess what's going on in the World Series

14
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:53,220
Speaker 0: business?".

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,223
Speaker 1: They didn't interrupt.

16
00:00:54,243 --> 00:00:56,880
Speaker 1: They do that all the time, and they do it during any play.

17
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:09,358
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, but the content of the interruption was notable because the second time they showed this, it was to show that the already ahead Cubs got a grand slam, and there was basically going to be a Game 7.

18
00:01:09,358 --> 00:01:10,800
Speaker 0: It was only like the second inning.

19
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,724
Speaker 1: I think it was the third inning, but yeah.

20
00:01:13,105 --> 00:01:16,595
Speaker 1: You hit a grand slam in Game 6 of the World Series, and you're the team that's down.

21
00:01:16,615 --> 00:01:18,360
Speaker 1: I mean, team up or down.

22
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:18,704
Speaker 1: Yup.

23
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,040
Speaker 1: That's legendary.

24
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,840
Speaker 0: Grand slams are not common anyway.

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:22,978
Speaker 1: Legendary.

26
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,954
Speaker 0: So yeah, it's going to come down to a big game.

27
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,605
Speaker 1: It's bad news either way, right?

28
00:01:29,745 --> 00:01:30,728
Speaker 1: Bad news number one.

29
00:01:30,748 --> 00:01:31,551
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, the Cubs.

30
00:01:31,571 --> 00:01:34,180
Speaker 1: I don't dislike the Cubs, and it's going to be mad exciting.

31
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:34,767
Speaker 0: I feel for them.

32
00:01:34,788 --> 00:01:35,456
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm a Lions fan.

33
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,582
Speaker 1: It'll be way exciting if they win.

34
00:01:37,622 --> 00:01:39,865
Speaker 1: The problem is that excitement will be short-lived.

35
00:01:39,925 --> 00:01:51,560
Speaker 1: If you look, like the White Sox and the Red Sox recently had similar, not quite as long droughts of winning, but like 70, 80 something, you know, super long droughts and curses, and they broke those curses.

36
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,725
Speaker 1: Now that the curses are over, it's like, now it's meh.

37
00:01:54,805 --> 00:01:56,007
Speaker 1: It's like your legend is gone.

38
00:01:56,548 --> 00:02:04,560
Speaker 1: It's like if I was a Cubs fan, I'd almost, like even if I was a Cubs fan, I'd almost want them to keep losing to maintain this legend.

39
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:12,300
Speaker 0: I can actually give a relevant bit of info on that situation, that sentiment, because remember when the Lions went winless?

40
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,464
Speaker 1: Yeah, right?

41
00:02:13,504 --> 00:02:14,431
Speaker 0: It's like, you know what?

42
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:15,680
Speaker 0: You can't have the Lions winning.

43
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,681
Speaker 0: Come on, win a game.

44
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:17,423
Speaker 0: So win a game.

45
00:02:17,483 --> 00:02:18,244
Speaker 0: Please win a game.

46
00:02:18,564 --> 00:02:29,400
Speaker 0: But when there are only like three games left, I kind of didn't want them to win a game, because if they lost every game but one or two, that would just be a really shitty season and no one would talk about it again.

47
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,700
Speaker 1: But yeah, the season the Lions won no games.

48
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,597
Speaker 0: Going winless, that was legendary.

49
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,101
Speaker 1: Legendary, right?

50
00:02:35,302 --> 00:02:35,843
Speaker 1: It's like there's.

51
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,809
Speaker 1: no, why would you just want to be boring and meh?

52
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:42,100
Speaker 1: So the Cubs, the only reason anyone cares about the Cubs at all is because they're cursed.

53
00:02:42,722 --> 00:02:43,604
Speaker 1: They just don't win.

54
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:47,857
Speaker 1: If they suddenly win, it's just like, alright, you're just some other garbage bin.

55
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:48,720
Speaker 1: Who gives a fuck now?

56
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,664
Speaker 0: I mean, look, back to the future.

57
00:02:50,744 --> 00:02:53,510
Speaker 0: If they were playing against any other team, except maybe the Yankees, right?

58
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:01,789
Speaker 1: I would, you know, just be like rooting against them.

59
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:02,791
Speaker 1: Like, no, keep losing.

60
00:03:02,852 --> 00:03:05,680
Speaker 1: But they had to be playing the racist team.

61
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,613
Speaker 1: So it's either the racist team wins or the legend dies.

62
00:03:09,654 --> 00:03:11,460
Speaker 1: There's not a good result that can happen.

63
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,580
Speaker 1: But at least if the legend dies, we'll have a short-term good result of party time.

64
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,060
Speaker 1: But long-term, you know, long and short-term bad results.

65
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,600
Speaker 0: But if the legend continues, I kind of want the curse of the Cubs to last another hundred years.

66
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,380
Speaker 1: Sure, but at the expense of racist team winning?

67
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,045
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's a flash in the pan.

68
00:03:29,065 --> 00:03:29,788
Speaker 0: That comes and goes.

69
00:03:29,868 --> 00:03:33,140
Speaker 0: The racist team exists independent of the rest of the spectrum.

70
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:40,540
Speaker 1: I guess I can hope that if the racist team wins, that, you know, it'll be sort of like the eye of anti-racism Sauron upon them.

71
00:03:41,142 --> 00:03:43,720
Speaker 1: And we can maybe get them to change their fucking team.

72
00:03:44,401 --> 00:03:45,218
Speaker 0: I don't think it will, though.

73
00:03:46,029 --> 00:03:46,178
Speaker 1: No.

74
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,380
Speaker 0: I think that's just gonna fester for a while.

75
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,664
Speaker 1: There's at least a small chance, right?

76
00:03:49,704 --> 00:03:53,339
Speaker 1: Because when they have their little parade, there'll be people protesting, hopefully, right?

77
00:03:53,821 --> 00:03:56,079
Speaker 1: I can't go to Cleveland and do that, but someone else can.

78
00:03:56,441 --> 00:04:00,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is it'll be overshadowed just by, you know, the presidential election and all that nonsense.

79
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,052
Speaker 0: I mean, the KKK just endorsed Trump officially, so...

80
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,679
Speaker 1: That should help you amplify the anti-racism message.

81
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:13,260
Speaker 0: Except, no, it seems to actually, like, be mobilizing white supremacists to vote, and the election's looking close.

82
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,059
Speaker 1: Well, good, mobilize them so we can find them.

83
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,959
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if he wins, then they're mobilized and they're kind of mainstream again.

84
00:04:21,223 --> 00:04:22,359
Speaker 1: Good, it'll be easy to get rid of them.

85
00:04:23,182 --> 00:04:25,778
Speaker 0: Uh, the only way it's easy to get rid of them at that point...

86
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,806
Speaker 1: This time, we couldn't do anything about it.

87
00:04:27,847 --> 00:04:28,891
Speaker 1: Now they'll just be visible.

88
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:30,838
Speaker 1: If they come out with their white hoods, it's like, "Oh, there they

89
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:31,039
Speaker 1: are.".

90
00:04:31,461 --> 00:04:32,410
Speaker 0: And what are you gonna do?

91
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:33,459
Speaker 0: Physically attack them?

92
00:04:34,182 --> 00:04:36,880
Speaker 1: I wouldn't really feel bad about bombing a KKK rally.

93
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,157
Speaker 0: You heard it here first, folks.

94
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,560
Speaker 1: Like, you know, like, I'm down with that.

95
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,800
Speaker 0: See, I'll go a step back from that to the "I hate Illinois Nazis" situation.

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, if I'm in a car and they're in the street, it's just gonna happen.

97
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:58,418
Speaker 0: Yeah, but seriously, even though it's right before the election, we're not talking about politics tonight, but for fuck's sake, vote for Clinton.

98
00:04:58,478 --> 00:04:59,180
Speaker 0: Jesus Christ.

99
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,940
Speaker 0: Like, if you don't vote, what the fuck is wrong with you?

100
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,867
Speaker 0: Like, if you don't live in the

101
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:04,251
Speaker 0: U.S.,

102
00:05:04,413 --> 00:05:05,200
Speaker 0: then yeah, you get a pass.

103
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,560
Speaker 1: I mean, also, you know, I live in New York, so I'm gonna vote, but it doesn't matter.

104
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,262
Speaker 0: Yeah, but not all of us.

105
00:05:10,363 --> 00:05:13,213
Speaker 0: Some of you live in, like, Pennsylvania or something, guys.

106
00:05:13,394 --> 00:05:14,960
Speaker 0: Like, I know at least one of you lives out there.

107
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,480
Speaker 1: If they're voting for Trump, they're not listening to Geek Nights.

108
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,517
Speaker 0: No, no, but what about people who...

109
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,524
Speaker 1: This is the problem I have.

110
00:05:20,584 --> 00:05:21,609
Speaker 1: It's like, shut up on Twitter.

111
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:23,960
Speaker 1: There's no one following you who doesn't agree with you.

112
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,823
Speaker 0: I know people.

113
00:05:25,164 --> 00:05:29,159
Speaker 0: There are people who follow us and follow me who are either voting for Jill Stein because they're morons...

114
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:30,060
Speaker 1: Okay, you're morons.

115
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,699
Speaker 0: ...or voting for Gary Johnson because they're morons... Morons.

116
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,760
Speaker 0: ...or not voting or saying they won't vote because they're morons.

117
00:05:36,344 --> 00:05:37,198
Speaker 1: And they're following you?

118
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:37,548
Speaker 1: Yeah.

119
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,620
Speaker 1: And even with you tweeting a thousand times a day, they haven't changed their mind.

120
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:41,083
Speaker 1: Maybe.

121
00:05:41,143 --> 00:05:42,880
Speaker 0: I'm trying to make them feel bad enough to actually vote.

122
00:05:44,182 --> 00:05:46,120
Speaker 1: But your tweeting isn't helping, so shut the fuck up.

123
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,548
Speaker 0: How do you know?

124
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:46,997
Speaker 0: It might be.

125
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,040
Speaker 1: Apparently, they haven't changed their mind yet after a year of you tweeting nonstop.

126
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,648
Speaker 0: I've convinced people to change votes in the past.

127
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:54,892
Speaker 0: A small number of votes could matter.

128
00:05:54,913 --> 00:05:57,040
Speaker 0: A couple hundred votes would have made Al Gore president.

129
00:05:57,405 --> 00:05:57,548
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

130
00:05:57,588 --> 00:05:57,874
Speaker 1: All right.

131
00:05:57,915 --> 00:05:58,200
Speaker 1: Anyway.

132
00:05:58,681 --> 00:05:59,405
Speaker 0: Sorry, Scott.

133
00:05:59,445 --> 00:06:00,934
Speaker 0: You used to listen to Obama's podcast.

134
00:06:00,974 --> 00:06:01,860
Speaker 0: You've fallen so far.

135
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:05,068
Speaker 1: Uh, you've not learned your lesson.

136
00:06:05,108 --> 00:06:06,452
Speaker 1: I learned, right?

137
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:09,080
Speaker 1: And I elevated above all that fray of garbage.

138
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:09,720
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

139
00:06:09,962 --> 00:06:11,159
Speaker 1: You're still doubting the muck.

140
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,968
Speaker 0: No, you're just trying to be a hipster.

141
00:06:13,048 --> 00:06:14,859
Speaker 0: You're like, "Ah, I'm above

142
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:14,939
Speaker 0: it.".

143
00:06:15,305 --> 00:06:15,940
Speaker 1: I am above it.

144
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,190
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

145
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,699
Speaker 1: I'm not poisoning my mind listening to people like Donald Trump talk like you are every day.

146
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,427
Speaker 0: Uh, okay.

147
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:23,760
Speaker 0: Anyway, you got any news?

148
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,201
Speaker 1: I do.

149
00:06:24,221 --> 00:06:29,800
Speaker 1: I have some great news, but I also have a geek fight because I'm paying attention to, you know, good stuff in the world, right?

150
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:30,963
Speaker 1: So, tiny news.

151
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:32,227
Speaker 1: Very tiny news.

152
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:36,060
Speaker 1: There's a manga called, and get this, ready for this manga title?

153
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,385
Speaker 1: It's the best manga title ever.

154
00:06:37,907 --> 00:06:39,575
Speaker 1: Delicious in Dungeon.

155
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,840
Speaker 0: Now, I think we mentioned this briefly a while ago.

156
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,228
Speaker 1: But anyway, it's licensed.

157
00:06:46,308 --> 00:06:48,460
Speaker 1: It's gonna come out in English for real, so I'm gonna buy it.

158
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:56,159
Speaker 0: If you're not sure what it is from the title, Delicious in Dungeon, the cover is a dude wearing fantasy armor and a backpack.

159
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,700
Speaker 0: And in the background, there's like an elf, and there's a dragon poking around the corner.

160
00:07:00,061 --> 00:07:04,620
Speaker 0: And the dude has a sword, a cooking pot, and a spatula.

161
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,723
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah.

162
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:10,280
Speaker 1: So, it's cooking in a dungeon, but it's got recipes and stuff like that, right?

163
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,620
Speaker 1: It's a cooking manga that takes, plus adventuring, fantasy style.

164
00:07:14,021 --> 00:07:17,540
Speaker 1: And you're probably thinking, it's like, oh, I'll get a fantasy adventure where they fight the orcs.

165
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:24,520
Speaker 1: And then, you know, when they stop to camp, we'll actually learn about cooking, like how to cook delicious food when camping.

166
00:07:26,662 --> 00:07:26,763
Speaker 1: No.

167
00:07:26,783 --> 00:07:30,999
Speaker 1: They cook fantasy food, like slime jerky.

168
00:07:31,981 --> 00:07:37,479
Speaker 1: And I think at one point, they take out a golem, and then they grow vegetables on the rocks of the golem.

169
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:40,247
Speaker 1: And then, right?

170
00:07:40,568 --> 00:07:43,720
Speaker 1: It's not real cooking, it's fantasy cooking also.

171
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,160
Speaker 0: You're gonna find out about if you can cook a slime and eat it, now that's gonna work out for you.

172
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,074
Speaker 1: Like gnoll stew and shit like that.

173
00:07:49,175 --> 00:07:49,800
Speaker 1: But it doesn't matter.

174
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,100
Speaker 0: I feel like you can make an entire tabletop RPG based on this exact concept and nothing more.

175
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,900
Speaker 1: They go into the detail of the recipes like they're real.

176
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,500
Speaker 1: And they probably could be real if you replace slime with like some kind of jelly or something.

177
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,639
Speaker 1: But you get the ideas, manga's awesome, it's coming out, so buy it and read it.

178
00:08:06,101 --> 00:08:06,885
Speaker 1: Alright, so Geek Bite.

179
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:10,280
Speaker 1: I went to see with NotRim, because he was on the other side of the world.

180
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,540
Speaker 1: His movie came out and was translated and licensed and put out.

181
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,157
Speaker 1: I think you can still see it if you hurry up.

182
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,743
Speaker 1: Called Ms.

183
00:08:18,763 --> 00:08:23,800
Speaker 1: Hogusai's Anime Studio IG, which stands for Is Good.

184
00:08:24,661 --> 00:08:30,959
Speaker 0: I'm curious what you think, because what you told me about the movie previously was, it's pretty good, and you left it at that.

185
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:31,757
Speaker 1: It's pretty good.

186
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,379
Speaker 1: It's not, you know, I was expecting it.

187
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,246
Speaker 1: So it's about, you know, it's Ms.

188
00:08:37,288 --> 00:08:37,669
Speaker 1: Hogusai.

189
00:08:37,688 --> 00:08:40,179
Speaker 1: It's about Hogusai, you know, the big wave painting.

190
00:08:40,961 --> 00:08:45,240
Speaker 1: It's his daughter, right, who is a real person who we know limited information about.

191
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:50,720
Speaker 1: And there was a manga based on her life, mostly biographical, plus some fantasy-ness.

192
00:08:51,863 --> 00:08:54,240
Speaker 1: And this movie is based on that manga.

193
00:08:54,881 --> 00:08:58,380
Speaker 1: So it's very sort of like episodic in a way.

194
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,100
Speaker 1: There's a few plot threads, and they really skip between them a lot.

195
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:07,220
Speaker 1: There's a plot thread of the cute boy in town, and the plot thread of having to paint to make money.

196
00:09:07,841 --> 00:09:12,700
Speaker 1: It's like each of the different sides, you know, the plot thread of the even younger sister who's sick.

197
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:18,960
Speaker 1: There's all these little plots, and it sort of skips scenes between them very rapidly.

198
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,120
Speaker 1: And some of them don't get fully enough attention on them, and some of them get a lot of attention.

199
00:09:24,582 --> 00:09:29,560
Speaker 1: And then there's a lot of single episodes that don't really connect to anything else, but are really interesting.

200
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:39,535
Speaker 1: Like the time they go, and there's this Geisha who's got a spirit in something, and they go to take a look at it so they can paint it or whatever, you know.

201
00:09:41,242 --> 00:09:42,640
Speaker 1: You know, cool stuff like that happens.

202
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,460
Speaker 1: So the animation is awesome, and there's a lot of, you know, beautiful scenes.

203
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,640
Speaker 1: The music, while good, I think is out of place.

204
00:09:51,741 --> 00:09:54,760
Speaker 1: They play like rock music and stuff, like right in the opening.

205
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:59,660
Speaker 1: It opens with rock music, and I'm just sort of like, normally that anachronistic music can work out.

206
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,480
Speaker 1: Like Samurai Champloo, which plays the hip-hop music, but for me at least, it didn't fit.

207
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,913
Speaker 1: I was just like, it's not working for me.

208
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:08,020
Speaker 1: You should have done something.

209
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,460
Speaker 0: Maybe you're just too primed by watching so much Japanese media that you expect more traditional soundtracks.

210
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,620
Speaker 1: No, because I'm fine with Samurai Champloo or any other crazy soundtrack.

211
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:19,285
Speaker 1: I think it's rock music.

212
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:24,760
Speaker 1: It's fine if you use the rock music and then you do stuff in the movie to fit with it, right?

213
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,273
Speaker 1: But they didn't, right?

214
00:10:26,536 --> 00:10:26,959
Speaker 1: It was weird.

215
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,567
Speaker 1: You know, it's an anime.

216
00:10:29,849 --> 00:10:30,533
Speaker 1: It's a movie.

217
00:10:30,855 --> 00:10:31,620
Speaker 1: It's not bad.

218
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,340
Speaker 0: Oh, look, get two times the tickets in three theaters near Long Island City right now.

219
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,014
Speaker 1: It's in the theaters in the U.S.

220
00:10:37,195 --> 00:10:37,720
Speaker 1: in English.

221
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,600
Speaker 1: It's, you know, medium widely distributed-ish.

222
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,859
Speaker 1: You can probably see it at the smaller movie theater near you.

223
00:10:45,402 --> 00:10:46,406
Speaker 1: You might as well.

224
00:10:46,707 --> 00:10:49,980
Speaker 1: Just don't go in and expecting like Satoshi Kon level, right?

225
00:10:50,841 --> 00:10:54,220
Speaker 1: Or Mamoru Hosoda level or Makoto Shinkai level.

226
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:58,259
Speaker 1: It's like a level below that in terms of, you know, how good a movie it is.

227
00:10:59,142 --> 00:11:00,017
Speaker 1: So, there you go.

228
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:14,117
Speaker 0: So, in a tiny news, and I'm not going to get too much into it because there aren't enough details to really know, but if you weren't aware, they're making a Sonic the Hedgehog movie and it appears it will be- Is it animated or live action or CG?

229
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:15,979
Speaker 1: So- Or a combination?

230
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,280
Speaker 0: It is, and this is why I'm worried, a CG live action hybrid.

231
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,260
Speaker 1: So, there's going to be a CG Sonic running around in like the real world?

232
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,760
Speaker 0: And I presume having sex with other Sonic the Hedgehogs.

233
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,324
Speaker 0: And Dr.

234
00:11:29,365 --> 00:11:30,980
Speaker 1: Robotnik's going to be like a guy in a costume?

235
00:11:32,522 --> 00:11:39,280
Speaker 1: And Tim Miller, the Deadpool director- The guy who left the second Deadpool movie or got kicked out?

236
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,219
Speaker 0: Yup, is probably going to be directing it.

237
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:47,220
Speaker 1: Okay, so he wanted to do a high budget Deadpool and no one on Deadpool but him wanted that.

238
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:50,079
Speaker 0: So, I guess now they're going to do a high budget Sonic the Hedgehog?

239
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:50,702
Speaker 0: Right, like.

240
00:11:50,783 --> 00:11:57,580
Speaker 1: I haven't seen any of these stupid superhero movies, but I read the news about him getting kicked off because it was on all the nerd news channels, right?

241
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,960
Speaker 1: So, I guess he went to the high budget Sonic movie.

242
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,600
Speaker 0: I guess this is partly because remember how Sailor Moon came out?

243
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,480
Speaker 0: Because the Sailor Moon anniversaries, they had to do something as they did Crystal.

244
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,399
Speaker 1: 25th anniversary of Sonic seems to be the reason- Is Sega financing this movie?

245
00:12:10,803 --> 00:12:12,819
Speaker 0: Yeah, Sega seems to have a big part of it.

246
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:19,580
Speaker 0: Sony Pictures, Mars Animation Planet, a wholly owned Sega Sammy holding subsidiary- So, it's a Japanese thing.

247
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,600
Speaker 1: It's Sony and Sega, so it's Japanese.

248
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,980
Speaker 0: It's the people who made the Captain Harlock CG animated film.

249
00:12:25,261 --> 00:12:27,080
Speaker 1: Oh, so it's a Japanese production.

250
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:31,379
Speaker 1: It's not a Hollywood production, but they got a Hollywood guy to make it for them?

251
00:12:32,481 --> 00:12:32,877
Speaker 0: Directed?

252
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,679
Speaker 0: Maybe Sonic the Hedgehog has just got to be super Deadpool-y?

253
00:12:38,081 --> 00:12:43,260
Speaker 1: But, I mean, if you tell me it's by the Harlock, now I know what we're sort of expecting, right?

254
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,198
Speaker 1: It's that kind of movie.

255
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,080
Speaker 1: It's not going to be some widely distributed in the US blockbuster kind of thing.

256
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:49,376
Speaker 1: We'll see.

257
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:58,460
Speaker 0: The only thing I have to say about this, because we don't have enough information to really go deep, is that there hasn't been a good Sonic game since Sonic 2.

258
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,612
Speaker 0: Like, Sonic games are just not good.

259
00:12:59,632 --> 00:13:00,218
Speaker 0: Maybe Sonic CD?

260
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,900
Speaker 1: Sonic 3 with Sonic and Knuckles was still good.

261
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,558
Speaker 0: Sonic games were never that good, though.

262
00:13:06,501 --> 00:13:08,820
Speaker 0: And they've been really bad for a long time.

263
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,600
Speaker 0: I feel like Sonic movies and comics are the only way to salvage that character.

264
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,399
Speaker 0: I would not even ever try to make a Sonic game again.

265
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:17,886
Speaker 1: I could make a Sonic game.

266
00:13:17,906 --> 00:13:18,147
Speaker 1: Great.

267
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,400
Speaker 1: I'd just make it just like Sonic 2, only longer.

268
00:13:20,881 --> 00:13:22,012
Speaker 0: But Sonic 2 wasn't even that good.

269
00:13:22,073 --> 00:13:22,820
Speaker 0: It was only okay.

270
00:13:23,301 --> 00:13:23,840
Speaker 0: It was okay.

271
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,639
Speaker 1: It's a great game.

272
00:13:24,842 --> 00:13:25,399
Speaker 0: It was an okay game.

273
00:13:25,824 --> 00:13:26,218
Speaker 1: What do you know?

274
00:13:27,062 --> 00:13:27,526
Speaker 0: I played it.

275
00:13:27,647 --> 00:13:28,736
Speaker 0: It wasn't that great.

276
00:13:28,756 --> 00:13:29,260
Speaker 0: It was okay.

277
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,092
Speaker 1: Let's see how good you are, Hattie.

278
00:13:31,112 --> 00:13:31,799
Speaker 1: You probably suck at it.

279
00:13:32,441 --> 00:13:33,218
Speaker 1: I don't know if I beat it.

280
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:37,180
Speaker 1: You just don't know how to appreciate that flavor of Sonic.

281
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,300
Speaker 0: You've got giant sprites, not a lot of view distance, simple maps, you've got to semi-memorize.

282
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:50,160
Speaker 1: It had really clever scrolling, actually, the way it could shift left and right and up and down a bit to put Sonic in different parts of the screen so you could see where you were going.

283
00:13:50,641 --> 00:13:55,640
Speaker 1: If you're running really fast to the right, it would push Sonic over to the left so you could see more ahead of you.

284
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,239
Speaker 0: Yeah, just Sonic wasn't fast enough.

285
00:13:58,061 --> 00:13:58,344
Speaker 1: Okay.

286
00:13:58,465 --> 00:13:59,820
Speaker 1: He didn't have enough hyper-processing.

287
00:14:06,201 --> 00:14:09,620
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

288
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,460
Speaker 0: What was my thing of the day?

289
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,728
Speaker 0: I'm not talking about the 2008 Lions series.

290
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:15,620
Speaker 0: So what was my thing of the day?

291
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,640
Speaker 1: I'll go my thing of the day.

292
00:14:16,841 --> 00:14:18,172
Speaker 0: So this is a video.

293
00:14:18,212 --> 00:14:18,999
Speaker 0: It's a short film.

294
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:26,380
Speaker 0: It appears it's from Russia and someone has titled it Modern Software Development.

295
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:37,280
Speaker 0: And it is the saga of someone trying to plug a plug into an outlet that the plug cannot fit into and the method by which they solve their problem.

296
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,360
Speaker 0: And it basically describes how Node.js development works today.

297
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:42,196
Speaker 1: Yeah.

298
00:14:42,501 --> 00:14:43,318
Speaker 0: It's pretty good.

299
00:14:44,681 --> 00:14:45,707
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

300
00:14:45,908 --> 00:14:47,820
Speaker 1: This whole Node.js thing, I could go off on that.

301
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,130
Speaker 1: Yeah.

302
00:14:48,784 --> 00:14:49,920
Speaker 1: Maybe that's our Monday episode.

303
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,180
Speaker 0: I said these are web frameworks.

304
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:52,720
Speaker 1: Just Node?

305
00:14:52,901 --> 00:14:53,467
Speaker 1: Just Why?

306
00:14:53,528 --> 00:14:54,600
Speaker 1: Node.js is Garbage.

307
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:55,811
Speaker 0: That's a good title.

308
00:14:55,831 --> 00:14:56,499
Speaker 0: It's the next Monday show.

309
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,865
Speaker 1: So this is YouTube.

310
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:02,440
Speaker 1: I was going to do one YouTube video from this channel, but I'm going to do the whole channel.

311
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,731
Speaker 1: The channel is Psychonomicsp5yckomixxx.

312
00:15:10,926 --> 00:15:11,379
Speaker 1: All caps.

313
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,838
Speaker 1: And what this channel is.

314
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,308
Speaker 1: Do you remember there was like that?

315
00:15:16,328 --> 00:15:20,780
Speaker 1: there was a YouTube channel where the guy was like dubbing over Transformers.

316
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,689
Speaker 1: It's like shockwave.

317
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:22,479
Speaker 1: You can't shoot shit.

318
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,700
Speaker 0: That is one of the funniest things that exists on the Internet.

319
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,360
Speaker 1: And there was also I don't know if it was the same channel or the different one that had the X-Men.

320
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,740
Speaker 1: It was like, you know, the juggernaut was like, I'm the juggernaut bitch.

321
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:33,340
Speaker 1: Yeah.

322
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:33,843
Speaker 1: It was that.

323
00:15:34,085 --> 00:15:35,800
Speaker 1: This is similar styling.

324
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:40,520
Speaker 1: But what this is, is basically redubbing unofficial, obviously.

325
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,740
Speaker 0: Created in trial version of Movavi video editor.

326
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:44,381
Speaker 1: Right.

327
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:48,512
Speaker 1: But that sort of gives it some charm using the free video editor.

328
00:15:48,552 --> 00:15:59,040
Speaker 1: that adds the overlay of various things, mostly Tunde cats and X-Men in, you know, the beautiful language of Jamaica.

329
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,960
Speaker 1: And this is really awesome because Jamaica is awesome.

330
00:16:04,122 --> 00:16:05,480
Speaker 1: And these are awesome things.

331
00:16:05,581 --> 00:16:07,120
Speaker 1: It's like, dude, you combine.

332
00:16:07,521 --> 00:16:07,882
Speaker 0: Oh, my.

333
00:16:07,942 --> 00:16:12,960
Speaker 0: The lyrics that they used in the opener are written out in the description.

334
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:13,721
Speaker 1: Yeah.

335
00:16:13,761 --> 00:16:19,120
Speaker 1: You know, because for people who, you know, can't understand what they're saying, actually, I can understand it pretty well.

336
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,799
Speaker 1: But, you know, other white people can't.

337
00:16:21,859 --> 00:16:21,980
Speaker 1: Right.

338
00:16:22,302 --> 00:16:23,037
Speaker 1: They need some help.

339
00:16:23,057 --> 00:16:23,200
Speaker 1: Right.

340
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:28,680
Speaker 1: And they understand that they're trying to spread, you know, the joy of their language to people through this nerdy medium.

341
00:16:29,062 --> 00:16:31,979
Speaker 1: It's a noble endeavor as well as an entertaining one.

342
00:16:32,989 --> 00:16:33,399
Speaker 0: Good stuff.

343
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,140
Speaker 0: So in the moment, the book club book is Rebecca.

344
00:16:37,786 --> 00:16:38,638
Speaker 0: I'm going to read it real soon.

345
00:16:39,302 --> 00:16:42,419
Speaker 0: We are going to be at Gamer X.

346
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,045
Speaker 1: Hooray.

347
00:16:43,941 --> 00:16:45,480
Speaker 0: Not this weekend.

348
00:16:46,168 --> 00:16:46,318
Speaker 1: Good.

349
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,139
Speaker 0: Not next weekend.

350
00:16:48,484 --> 00:16:49,620
Speaker 0: I think it's the following weekend.

351
00:16:49,902 --> 00:16:50,560
Speaker 0: It is next weekend.

352
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,279
Speaker 0: It's next weekend.

353
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,680
Speaker 1: You're getting close to Thanksgiving.

354
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,860
Speaker 1: There's too many weekends.

355
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,980
Speaker 0: Next weekend, we will be at Gamer X East in New York City, in Manhattan, talking about writing game rules.

356
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,359
Speaker 0: And otherwise, it's just a super awesome LGBT focused and friendly game.

357
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,400
Speaker 1: Our panel is on Sunday, but the con is Saturday, Sunday.

358
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:07,722
Speaker 0: Yeah.

359
00:17:07,782 --> 00:17:08,560
Speaker 0: You should go to both days.

360
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:10,178
Speaker 1: I guess on Saturday we're playing games.

361
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:10,653
Speaker 0: Yeah.

362
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,040
Speaker 0: And Sunday we're playing games.

363
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,099
Speaker 1: I get my games together.

364
00:17:14,582 --> 00:17:16,020
Speaker 0: Otherwise, check us out.

365
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:16,356
Speaker 0: There it is.

366
00:17:16,481 --> 00:17:17,071
Speaker 0: There's our thing.

367
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:20,419
Speaker 0: Occasionally, the site messes up.

368
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,022
Speaker 0: So it shows.

369
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:29,460
Speaker 0: the speakers are DeCoster, Rim, Ampersand Quatt, Brandon Ampersand Quatt, and Scott Rubin.

370
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,640
Speaker 0: Good job, Shed.

371
00:17:31,622 --> 00:17:32,500
Speaker 1: Oh, Quatt.

372
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:32,980
Speaker 1: I see.

373
00:17:33,982 --> 00:17:34,092
Speaker 0: Quatt.

374
00:17:34,501 --> 00:17:35,960
Speaker 1: Their HTML element code.

375
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,356
Speaker 1: Yeah.

376
00:17:36,761 --> 00:17:38,500
Speaker 0: How do people still fuck up the Quatt?

377
00:17:39,181 --> 00:17:41,420
Speaker 0: I feel like that's the first thing.

378
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,900
Speaker 0: You just make sure it works on your website.

379
00:17:43,741 --> 00:17:48,460
Speaker 1: Actually, that happens because in their template, they're in their template rendering engine.

380
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,198
Speaker 1: They didn't tell it.

381
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:54,000
Speaker 1: That's probably in the database, and they didn't mark it as safe, so it's refusing to render it as HTML.

382
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,800
Speaker 1: Instead, it automatically put escape characters and all those things to make them render literally.

383
00:18:00,301 --> 00:18:01,299
Speaker 1: An amateur mistake.

384
00:18:01,901 --> 00:18:03,160
Speaker 0: We're also going to be at MAGFest.

385
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,280
Speaker 0: We're doing, between me and Scott, between five and seven panels.

386
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,680
Speaker 0: And otherwise, it's just four days of gaming and going hot and all that stuff.

387
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,538
Speaker 0: It's going to be good times.

388
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:14,340
Speaker 1: Play some X-Mon.

389
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,980
Speaker 0: Follow, check out my YouTube channel and Scott's YouTube channel.

390
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,018
Speaker 0: We've both got stuff going on.

391
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,080
Speaker 0: Six player X-Mon.

392
00:18:20,181 --> 00:18:21,739
Speaker 0: And I did read the Fishy story.

393
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:26,040
Speaker 0: It is on the Patreon if you want to hear the somewhat unnerving tale of Fishy.

394
00:18:26,201 --> 00:18:26,900
Speaker 1: Don't bother with that.

395
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,375
Speaker 0: It's pretty good.

396
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,237
Speaker 0: So it was for Halloween, which happened to also be the anniversary of Geek Nights, 11 years running.

397
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:39,760
Speaker 0: We did the show, and we had a little party where we wanted to watch a horror-ish movie.

398
00:18:40,303 --> 00:18:43,400
Speaker 0: So we watched Attack the Block, which most of the crew had not seen.

399
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,280
Speaker 1: It was in my queue, and now it's out of the queue.

400
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,860
Speaker 1: So all you people who are thinking Scott's queue is not a real thing, it's real.

401
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,219
Speaker 0: It was the second time I've seen it.

402
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,240
Speaker 0: It's a pretty good movie.

403
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:52,960
Speaker 0: It's not perfect.

404
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,639
Speaker 0: It's got flaws.

405
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,599
Speaker 1: I'm going to say that movie.

406
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:55,539
Speaker 1: It was a good movie.

407
00:18:55,822 --> 00:18:57,000
Speaker 1: It was entertaining and enjoyable.

408
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,240
Speaker 1: But again, I think the people hyped it up above what it actually was.

409
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:01,839
Speaker 0: Who hyped it up?

410
00:19:02,001 --> 00:19:04,980
Speaker 0: I remember most people said it's a pretty good horror movie.

411
00:19:05,363 --> 00:19:06,340
Speaker 0: It's better than you expect.

412
00:19:06,764 --> 00:19:07,220
Speaker 1: That's people.

413
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:07,644
Speaker 0: Who?

414
00:19:09,103 --> 00:19:11,099
Speaker 1: Such as Chase and others on the internet.

415
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,320
Speaker 0: Chase will hype up what he ate for breakfast.

416
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,980
Speaker 1: Everyone who told me about that movie was like, "Oh, it's fucking amazing.

417
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:20,140
Speaker 0: Chase will tell you that literally any movie is the greatest movie ever.

418
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,140
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, many peoples, internet peoples.

419
00:19:22,222 --> 00:19:22,939
Speaker 1: Name another who.

420
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,599
Speaker 1: People on Twitter.

421
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,379
Speaker 0: Who are these people?

422
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:35,557
Speaker 1: In general, the general sentiment about that movie that was portrayed to me is that it was fucking incredible, and it was good.

423
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:37,440
Speaker 0: I did not see that anywhere.

424
00:19:38,023 --> 00:19:41,260
Speaker 1: I would show it and promote it to others, but not so crazily.

425
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:46,898
Speaker 0: I saw people saying it was pretty good, better than I expected, or, "Hey, you should watch this.

426
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,095
Speaker 0: It's not the kind of movie you might think to

427
00:19:48,136 --> 00:19:48,379
Speaker 0: watch.".

428
00:19:49,661 --> 00:19:52,979
Speaker 1: Also, it wasn't the movie I thought it was.

429
00:19:53,581 --> 00:20:03,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, you thought it was ... I know what you were thinking, because we're not going to spoil anything in it, but it escalates to the main thread pretty much right away.

430
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, I thought it was a different kind of movie.

431
00:20:06,002 --> 00:20:06,112
Speaker 0: Yeah.

432
00:20:06,466 --> 00:20:07,080
Speaker 0: It was pretty good, though.

433
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:14,100
Speaker 0: I liked it, but we're not talking about that today, because before that, in traditional sense, we watched a cartoon, and it was a cartoon that I have not seen.

434
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,540
Speaker 1: That's what you got to do when there's a movie coming on.

435
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,299
Speaker 1: You got to watch the short cartoon before the movie.

436
00:20:17,562 --> 00:20:17,652
Speaker 0: Yeah.

437
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:23,820
Speaker 0: I have not seen this cartoon in its original full format since I was a little, little kid.

438
00:20:24,221 --> 00:20:26,600
Speaker 1: I may have or may not have.

439
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:32,140
Speaker 1: I've only seen- I remembered that it existed, but I don't remember if I had ever actually seen it in full at any point in my life.

440
00:20:32,181 --> 00:20:33,680
Speaker 0: I have definitely seen it in full.

441
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:33,940
Speaker 1: I did.

442
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:38,440
Speaker 1: I was so young, there was no way I could remember much of it other than vague imagery.

443
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,400
Speaker 0: I remembered every single song.

444
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,980
Speaker 0: Who's that coming down the street?

445
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,640
Speaker 0: I saw- Are they shovels or are they feet?

446
00:20:44,122 --> 00:20:46,201
Speaker 0: I saw this thing- ...

447
00:20:46,201 --> 00:20:46,836
Speaker 1: two days ago.

448
00:20:47,144 --> 00:20:47,399
Speaker 1: Yup.

449
00:20:47,741 --> 00:20:48,593
Speaker 1: I don't remember any songs.

450
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:49,629
Speaker 1: Really?

451
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,960
Speaker 0: I remember- Are they shovels or are they feet?

452
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,229
Speaker 0: Really?

453
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,079
Speaker 0: Can't remember that?

454
00:20:53,221 --> 00:20:54,359
Speaker 1: I remember it because you just said it.

455
00:20:55,424 --> 00:20:59,180
Speaker 1: Before you said that, asked me to name or sing any of the songs, I couldn't.

456
00:21:00,784 --> 00:21:13,959
Speaker 0: I saw it more recently, like middle school, high school, as most kids today I assume see it because Disney would take segments of their older cartoons and embed them in framing stories to make others shit later.

457
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:23,631
Speaker 1: Right, so people don't realize this, but for a lot of the Disney shorts, like a lot of the legendary type ones that you think of, for example, my favorite Mickey and the Beanstalk, right?

458
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,919
Speaker 1: It's like, okay, they made Mickey and the Beanstalk.

459
00:21:26,961 --> 00:21:28,880
Speaker 1: Where did- Mickey and the Beanstalk's pretty short, right?

460
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,600
Speaker 1: It's not a movie length.

461
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,360
Speaker 1: It's like what, 15 minutes probably?

462
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:33,420
Speaker 1: I'm just guessing.

463
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,060
Speaker 1: I don't know.

464
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,319
Speaker 1: It's not long, right?

465
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,180
Speaker 1: So where they made this a long ass time ago, right?

466
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,396
Speaker 1: Like the early 20th century, when and where was it released?

467
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:46,300
Speaker 1: It wasn't put on television.

468
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,360
Speaker 1: It's like they didn't have color TV then, right?

469
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,119
Speaker 1: 29 minutes.

470
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:50,237
Speaker 1: That's pretty good.

471
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,670
Speaker 1: So it's like if you wanted to see Mickey and the Beanstalk, you didn't go to the movie theater for 29 minutes, right?

472
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,180
Speaker 1: And buy a movie ticket, right?

473
00:21:59,502 --> 00:22:00,280
Speaker 1: How was it released?

474
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,320
Speaker 1: It was released as part of this compilation thing called Fun and Fancy Free.

475
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:11,780
Speaker 1: You went and bought a ticket to go see Fun and Fancy Free at the movie theater, which was like multiple cartoons, probably like two or three of them.

476
00:22:12,361 --> 00:22:18,960
Speaker 1: And in between the cartoons, there was like narration, live action, puppet show thing to sort of like tie it together somehow.

477
00:22:19,501 --> 00:22:23,616
Speaker 1: And there's a reason no one watches it that way because that shit is scary garbage, right?

478
00:22:24,861 --> 00:22:31,359
Speaker 1: They just cut the cartoons out and released them on VHSs and on television and whatnot individually.

479
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:36,720
Speaker 1: But the narrator in Mickey and the Beanstalk is the narrator from Fun and Fancy Free.

480
00:22:37,601 --> 00:22:39,667
Speaker 1: So this Ichabod, Mr.

481
00:22:39,727 --> 00:22:42,756
Speaker 1: Crane, whatnot was a similar situation.

482
00:22:42,816 --> 00:22:48,880
Speaker 1: where it was, you went to the movie theater, you bought a ticket and you got multiple Disney shorts together.

483
00:22:49,121 --> 00:23:00,620
Speaker 0: Well, the 11th Walt Disney theatrical animated feature and is the last of the studio's package film era of the 40s following the three Caballeros, which I'm a big fan of as a kid at least.

484
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,960
Speaker 0: Donald's trying to get his freak on with that girl.

485
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,626
Speaker 1: Right, that's what they did before.

486
00:23:04,646 --> 00:23:08,320
Speaker 1: they had the full length animated feature, right?

487
00:23:08,401 --> 00:23:09,680
Speaker 1: Snow White style, right?

488
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,400
Speaker 1: Where it's like 90 minutes, one cartoon.

489
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,200
Speaker 1: Before then, it was the other kind, the package era.

490
00:23:15,082 --> 00:23:16,860
Speaker 1: I guess that's what it's called according to Wikipedia.

491
00:23:17,182 --> 00:23:21,455
Speaker 0: Reception, I'm just looking around all the business because I didn't know anything about the history of this particular film.

492
00:23:22,781 --> 00:23:25,220
Speaker 1: Right, so anyway, it's the story of Sleepy Hollow, right?

493
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,359
Speaker 1: There's a dude, Ichabod Crane, he comes to town.

494
00:23:27,801 --> 00:23:29,639
Speaker 1: He's the new school teacher in town.

495
00:23:30,182 --> 00:23:31,339
Speaker 1: He's sort of a weird guy.

496
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,558
Speaker 1: The town is weird.

497
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:37,940
Speaker 1: And then there's a headless horseman who gets crazy cray with the Halloween action.

498
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:50,120
Speaker 0: I saw this as a little kid and my memories of it, I remembered all the songs, but it is interesting how different my perception of the story watching it as an adult is compared to as a kid.

499
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,260
Speaker 0: Because as a kid, it was just, "Fuck that bully guy.

500
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,193
Speaker 0: Ichabod Crane is totally the

501
00:23:55,254 --> 00:23:55,617
Speaker 0: hero.".

502
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:57,000
Speaker 0: And then he got murdered.

503
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,480
Speaker 0: I legit just assumed he got killed by that fucking dude.

504
00:24:01,021 --> 00:24:06,659
Speaker 0: Right, I mean, as a kid, I was aware that it wasn't really the headless horseman, that it was just that jerk.

505
00:24:06,981 --> 00:24:09,620
Speaker 0: And I was also aware that he probably killed Ichabod.

506
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,399
Speaker 0: That's what I thought.

507
00:24:10,762 --> 00:24:13,539
Speaker 1: So not remembering the cartoon very well, right?

508
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:19,898
Speaker 1: I'd been, you know, most of my exposure to the headless horseman story was just people telling the story.

509
00:24:20,503 --> 00:24:20,568
Speaker 1: Yup.

510
00:24:21,481 --> 00:24:22,879
Speaker 0: Brom Boon's my man.

511
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:34,271
Speaker 1: And it was told, you know, I'd not read it, like the original, and it was told to me in so many different ways that I didn't really have any clarity on what the real original story actually was, ever.

512
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,210
Speaker 1: Like, if you asked me before we watched it yesterday, it's like, "Tell you the story of the headless

513
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:40,598
Speaker 1: horseman.".

514
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:50,477
Speaker 1: I would have been like, "There was a town, and this guy Ichabod Crane comes to town, and then there's an evil headless horseman haunting the town, and it fucks him

515
00:24:50,598 --> 00:24:50,658
Speaker 1: up.".

516
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,760
Speaker 1: Or like, I might have even said, you know, I was actually confused.

517
00:24:55,622 --> 00:24:57,595
Speaker 1: I was like, "Is Ichabod, is he the

518
00:24:57,616 --> 00:24:58,059
Speaker 1: horseman?".

519
00:24:59,947 --> 00:25:02,880
Speaker 1: And he terrorizes the town to get revenge.

520
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:08,880
Speaker 0: I feel like the headless horseman is a pretty standard and well-known Americana-like story.

521
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:14,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it just, in my life, it wasn't told to me in any way that I remembered.

522
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:21,796
Speaker 0: Right, the only thing as a kid, like this thing's like, "Near the sleepy town of Peekskill, Tarrytown, all that

523
00:25:21,817 --> 00:25:21,980
Speaker 0: business.".

524
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:24,540
Speaker 0: As a kid, I had no idea this was in New York.

525
00:25:24,701 --> 00:25:27,380
Speaker 1: I literally never even- That's the one thing I did know, because I lived over relatively close.

526
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:32,719
Speaker 0: I never even considered the idea that there was a place, there was actually a Sleepy Hollow or anything.

527
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:36,440
Speaker 1: I didn't even really- If Sleepy Hollow had been in Michigan, you wouldn't have felt that way.

528
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it was in some other fucking state, so it didn't exist.

529
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,558
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it existed for us.

530
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:46,979
Speaker 0: But then, when I started working at Yonkers, the first time I drove to work on my home, I'm like, "9D Sleepy Hollow, really?

531
00:25:47,542 --> 00:25:48,355
Speaker 0: Is that the Sleepy

532
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:48,497
Speaker 0: Hollow?".

533
00:25:48,782 --> 00:25:49,899
Speaker 1: Yes, it's the Sleepy Hollow.

534
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,839
Speaker 1: It's not just one of those places that renamed itself to be, you know.

535
00:25:55,260 --> 00:26:09,560
Speaker 0: So, yeah, watching this again as an adult, I really like it a lot, because it's really funny as an adult watching this thing, because Ichabod is kind of a shithead.

536
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,659
Speaker 1: Everyone, there's not really any good people.

537
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,858
Speaker 1: But Bronn Bone- Except the Baker.

538
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,580
Speaker 0: At first, Ichabod's a normal dude, and Bronn Bone's just this awesome hero.

539
00:26:17,348 --> 00:26:17,799
Speaker 0: He's just fine.

540
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, they both start out as being really good.

541
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:27,860
Speaker 1: At the very beginning, Ichabod, he looks ugly, like a stick person, but he's got skills like Sakamoto, right?

542
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:33,460
Speaker 1: And Bronn Bone is like Gaston, but he's not an evil Gaston, at least at the very beginning.

543
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,879
Speaker 1: He's just a badass dude in town.

544
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,900
Speaker 0: Pretty sure that this takes place after Sleeping Beauty.

545
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:43,320
Speaker 0: We're pretty sure that almost every male in this village is one of Gaston's descendants.

546
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,540
Speaker 1: Doesn't Sleeping Beauty take place in Europe?

547
00:26:46,722 --> 00:26:50,416
Speaker 0: I guess he must have made his way over here, because seriously, there's like eight Gastons in this thing.

548
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,680
Speaker 0: And also, wouldn't it be- And then one Uber Gaston.

549
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,659
Speaker 1: Also, wouldn't it be a similar time period?

550
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:56,039
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure.

551
00:26:56,383 --> 00:26:58,200
Speaker 1: Why does Sleeping Beauty happen?

552
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,380
Speaker 1: I mean, not Sleeping Beauty.

553
00:26:59,721 --> 00:27:02,120
Speaker 1: I mean, Beauty and the Beast.

554
00:27:02,641 --> 00:27:04,500
Speaker 1: Sleeping Beauty definitely happens way before.

555
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,260
Speaker 1: That's like they're living in the castle.

556
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:10,420
Speaker 0: I'm just saying that Bronn Bone is definitely somehow related to Gaston.

557
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,860
Speaker 1: They definitely have similar personalities and appearances.

558
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:23,420
Speaker 0: But basically, as an adult just watching this, Ichabod's just educated and self-serving.

559
00:27:23,481 --> 00:27:24,920
Speaker 1: But he's still a bad person.

560
00:27:25,022 --> 00:27:25,780
Speaker 0: He's not that bad, though.

561
00:27:25,962 --> 00:27:26,317
Speaker 0: He's self-serving.

562
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,118
Speaker 1: He's not that bad, but yeah, he's not like a saint.

563
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:28,520
Speaker 0: I mean, what?

564
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:32,880
Speaker 0: He's actually teaching those girls how to sing, and they all swoon over him just because he knows stuff.

565
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,680
Speaker 1: But he's teaching them to swing because he wants them to swoon.

566
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,940
Speaker 1: Hey, if you do a bad- He's not teaching them to sing to actually spread cultures.

567
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,360
Speaker 0: If you do a good thing for a bad reason, you still did a good thing.

568
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,859
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't make you a good person, though.

569
00:27:43,123 --> 00:27:44,440
Speaker 0: Who cares if he's a good or bad person?

570
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,480
Speaker 0: He wasn't doing anything wrong.

571
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,300
Speaker 1: You were just arguing about whether he was a good person or not.

572
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,420
Speaker 0: The only bad thing he did is he stole that one pie.

573
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,180
Speaker 0: Otherwise, he bought- He stole a lot of food.

574
00:27:54,344 --> 00:27:57,060
Speaker 1: Also, how did he eat so much and not get fat and be a stick figure?

575
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,680
Speaker 0: Well, because he appears to be literally twice as tall as anyone in this town.

576
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,816
Speaker 1: He was very tall, yeah.

577
00:28:02,401 --> 00:28:03,199
Speaker 0: When they're dancing.

578
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,480
Speaker 0: But meanwhile, Brom Bones, it seems fine.

579
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:16,040
Speaker 0: But then as soon as he wants to make it with that girl, then he turns into a giant shithead and proceeds to do a bunch of illegal and intimidating things.

580
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,520
Speaker 0: He tries to basically murder Ichabod Crane, and then he does murder Ichabod Crane.

581
00:28:20,641 --> 00:28:27,440
Speaker 1: Also, the girl seems to not- It's like, if you're a kid watching it, you know, you don't see carefully.

582
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:31,880
Speaker 0: No, as a kid, I just assumed she likes Ichabod, and then she's trying to ruin it.

583
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:37,659
Speaker 1: But actually, she's just sort of using Ichabod to make the other dude jealous, and she just takes it too far.

584
00:28:38,422 --> 00:28:40,260
Speaker 1: She could have had that dude any time she wanted.

585
00:28:40,461 --> 00:28:40,736
Speaker 1: Yup.

586
00:28:42,322 --> 00:28:44,200
Speaker 1: But only an adult eyeball can see that happening.

587
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:57,739
Speaker 0: But that's why her and Ichabod would actually be good for each other, because they're both just manipulating other people, and with his mad skills and her mad skills and her father's wealth, because when Ichabod's imagining being with her- They could have run that shit.

588
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,577
Speaker 0: He keeps imagining, like, "Ooh, I'll make out with

589
00:29:00,617 --> 00:29:00,738
Speaker 0: her.".

590
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:07,520
Speaker 0: But then he imagines, like, it shows her dad sitting there, and he imagines himself wearing all the dad's stuff.

591
00:29:07,761 --> 00:29:09,994
Speaker 0: And our friend Judith is just like, "One day, I'll be

592
00:29:10,095 --> 00:29:10,276
Speaker 0: you.".

593
00:29:12,382 --> 00:29:14,979
Speaker 0: But they would have made a good team, and I wonder if she was feeling that too.

594
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:15,780
Speaker 1: Maybe.

595
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:22,158
Speaker 0: 'Cause she was a little bit disdainful of Brom Bones' rough and uneducated ways, but I guess she ended up marrying him, so...

596
00:29:22,483 --> 00:29:22,670
Speaker 1: Yup.

597
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,199
Speaker 0: You know, Ichabod's dead.

598
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:25,170
Speaker 1: Sure.

599
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:35,460
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure he's- I mean, they show you this, like, denomat, where, like, weird rumors that he went off and married some woman and had all these kids that look just like him, but those are just rumors.

600
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:43,100
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure Brom Bones just fucking killed him, because in the actual chase segment, he is really trying- He's swinging a sword at him violently.

601
00:29:43,321 --> 00:29:47,880
Speaker 0: And we know from an earlier scene that that sword is sharp as fuck.

602
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:51,717
Speaker 1: And it's surprising, like, how much he swings it without actually hitting him, but here's the thing.

603
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:55,020
Speaker 1: If he did kill him, he wasn't smart, Brom Bones, right?

604
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:04,320
Speaker 0: So- No, he left the pumpkin there so that the townsfolk would assume that the Headless Horseman had driven him away, when really, he's buried in a shallow grave right off the side of that road.

605
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:04,865
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

606
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,300
Speaker 1: Where is this body, right?

607
00:30:06,361 --> 00:30:08,020
Speaker 1: He's not good at hiding the body.

608
00:30:08,502 --> 00:30:09,359
Speaker 1: It would have been found.

609
00:30:10,104 --> 00:30:11,319
Speaker 0: I don't think it would have been found.

610
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,679
Speaker 0: Who's gonna go looking for a body?

611
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:14,979
Speaker 1: If you put it in a shallow grave, they're gonna smell it.

612
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,314
Speaker 0: Nah, probably not.

613
00:30:16,354 --> 00:30:17,820
Speaker 1: I mean- On that well-traveled road?

614
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,080
Speaker 0: That road looked the opposite of well-traveled.

615
00:30:20,241 --> 00:30:22,680
Speaker 1: It had a bridge on it, therefore it had to have some amount of travel.

616
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,949
Speaker 0: He had all night, too.

617
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:25,120
Speaker 0: Like, who's looking for him?

618
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,100
Speaker 0: He could have done anything with it.

619
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:30,640
Speaker 1: Also, apparently you need to go on that road to get from the party barn to the town.

620
00:30:31,982 --> 00:30:33,780
Speaker 1: 'Cause I guess they have their parties way outside town.

621
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,406
Speaker 1: You know what?

622
00:30:34,629 --> 00:30:35,480
Speaker 0: It's right by the water.

623
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,380
Speaker 0: Maybe he just threw the body in the river and it floated away.

624
00:30:37,642 --> 00:30:37,750
Speaker 0: Maybe.

625
00:30:39,021 --> 00:30:41,136
Speaker 0: Town downstream's not gonna be like, "Hey, is this your

626
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:41,579
Speaker 0: body?".

627
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,036
Speaker 0: They're just gonna ignore it or bury it themselves.

628
00:30:44,056 --> 00:30:44,579
Speaker 0: They don't care.

629
00:30:45,281 --> 00:30:47,600
Speaker 0: I mean, what would- Maybe it goes into the Hudson.

630
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,998
Speaker 0: I mean, look at where this place is.

631
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,340
Speaker 0: It's gonna end up in, like, New York, that body.

632
00:30:53,420 --> 00:31:03,380
Speaker 1: All I'm gonna say is, you know, the baker is the best person in this whole- I forgot about all the other girls in this thing.

633
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:03,938
Speaker 1: The singing ones?

634
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:08,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, because- Well, 'cause they get so much screen time right at the very beginning and then they're gone.

635
00:31:08,481 --> 00:31:14,620
Speaker 0: Except the chubby girl, who's cute, who comes back and is a major weapon that is used between the two guys.

636
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,058
Speaker 1: But she can't dance.

637
00:31:16,523 --> 00:31:16,637
Speaker 0: Yeah.

638
00:31:17,301 --> 00:31:20,237
Speaker 0: I love how in the background her sound effect is just, "Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo,

639
00:31:20,277 --> 00:31:20,478
Speaker 0: whoo.".

640
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,633
Speaker 1: Yeah, no one in this whole thing talks.

641
00:31:22,693 --> 00:31:23,680
Speaker 1: There's no voice acting.

642
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,960
Speaker 0: It's just Bing Crosby narrating.

643
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,399
Speaker 1: It's all noises and one narrator voiceover and that's it.

644
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,360
Speaker 0: The animation is also pretty superb, actually.

645
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,220
Speaker 1: It's Disney animation, right?

646
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:37,040
Speaker 1: So it's the same exact Disney animation you get with all other Disney things.

647
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:46,560
Speaker 0: On Wikipedia, the two lone rivals are invited to the Van Tassel Halloween party where Braum tries to swap a plump woman for Katrina, but comically fails.

648
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:58,380
Speaker 0: But that scene, I wouldn't laugh out loud other than add my adult observations to this thing until that scene, because it goes on so much longer than you expect it to.

649
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,060
Speaker 1: You should go find the video on YouTube that shows the animation that was reused from or in this, right?

650
00:32:04,241 --> 00:32:06,398
Speaker 1: Because that's what Disney did, is they just animated things once.

651
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,740
Speaker 0: But there's not nearly as much, as far as I can tell, compared to the Robin Hood.

652
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was the Robin Hood Lion King one, right?

653
00:32:14,581 --> 00:32:15,032
Speaker 1: Lion King?

654
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:16,539
Speaker 1: Not Lion King, Jungle Book.

655
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:16,790
Speaker 1: Yup.

656
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,519
Speaker 1: The Jungle Book Robin Hood where it's the exact same dance.

657
00:32:19,802 --> 00:32:20,158
Speaker 0: Yup.

658
00:32:20,461 --> 00:32:21,439
Speaker 1: Used twice, yeah.

659
00:32:22,184 --> 00:32:24,559
Speaker 0: Half that movie is just- The same exact movie.

660
00:32:24,904 --> 00:32:24,992
Speaker 1: Yup.

661
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:33,240
Speaker 1: But yeah, I mean, if you are in the mood to watch a short Disney from the olden days, you should watch Mickey and the Beanstalk.

662
00:32:33,572 --> 00:32:33,740
Speaker 1: Yeah.

663
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,478
Speaker 1: And if you're still in the mood, you should watch something else with Goofy in it.

664
00:32:38,962 --> 00:32:41,810
Speaker 0: Actually, my favorites are still all of the.

665
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:45,240
Speaker 0: Goofy teaches you how to do a thing, like Goofy goes skiing.

666
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,280
Speaker 1: You should watch some, you know, you should go watch some Donald Duck or some Chip and Dale.

667
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,480
Speaker 1: But you know, this isn't a bad choice.

668
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:58,080
Speaker 0: This is actually, I'd put it pretty high up there, because it's very demonstrative of what Disney was like in that era.

669
00:32:58,665 --> 00:33:00,120
Speaker 0: And it's a half hour long.

670
00:33:00,581 --> 00:33:04,280
Speaker 0: And if you're really desperate, there's a whole other half hour with the wind in the willows that we just skipped.

671
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,360
Speaker 1: Don't watch that garbage.

672
00:33:05,781 --> 00:33:07,580
Speaker 0: I don't know if I've ever actually seen it.

673
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,220
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure as a kid, we never watched it.

674
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,740
Speaker 0: We just watched the Sleepy Hollow one.

675
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:16,853
Speaker 1: I definitely, I don't remember much, but I remember there was the Mr.

676
00:33:16,913 --> 00:33:18,759
Speaker 1: Toad cartoon, because I saw it.

677
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,971
Speaker 1: Because I was like, you know, this is Mr.

678
00:33:21,011 --> 00:33:22,640
Speaker 1: Toad's wild ride at Disney World.

679
00:33:23,163 --> 00:33:24,277
Speaker 1: And I was like, what the fuck is Mr.

680
00:33:24,338 --> 00:33:24,520
Speaker 1: Toad?

681
00:33:24,662 --> 00:33:26,259
Speaker 1: So then I saw that at some point.

682
00:33:26,662 --> 00:33:29,060
Speaker 1: And I remember just being like, whoa, that is not good.

683
00:33:29,981 --> 00:33:32,399
Speaker 1: I don't remember anything else other than that's not good.

684
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:39,199
Speaker 0: Alright, so yeah, Bing Crosby did play Ichabod Crane, Brom Bones, and the narrator whenever sound effects were needed.

685
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:44,938
Speaker 0: Uh, the, let's see, ready, Thaddeus Toad, Mr.

686
00:33:44,979 --> 00:33:45,320
Speaker 0: Winky.

687
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,899
Speaker 0: I'm just looking at all these people here.

688
00:33:47,521 --> 00:33:50,560
Speaker 0: A guy named Pinto Culvig did one role.

689
00:33:50,901 --> 00:33:53,920
Speaker 0: He played Ichabod Crane whenever he was screaming, apparently.

690
00:33:54,104 --> 00:33:54,657
Speaker 1: The scream guy.

691
00:33:55,481 --> 00:33:58,460
Speaker 0: Uh, Pinto Culvig was a vaudeville act.

692
00:33:58,822 --> 00:34:00,520
Speaker 0: Ooh, I found a bunch of Wikipedia pages to read.

693
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,580
Speaker 0: He lived until the late '60s.

694
00:34:01,741 --> 00:34:06,300
Speaker 1: It is a somewhat vaudevillian act, this cartoon here.

695
00:34:06,621 --> 00:34:11,460
Speaker 0: The madcap antics while they're dancing, that would be a good vaudeville stage scene, I guess.

696
00:34:11,842 --> 00:34:11,929
Speaker 1: Yeah.

697
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,120
Speaker 0: So yeah, this was our Halloween, this and Attack the Block.

698
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,880
Speaker 0: Attack the Block isn't really relevant to Wednesday, but this certainly was.

699
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,297
Speaker 1: Attack the Block is way better than this.

700
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:21,223
Speaker 0: Aye!

701
00:34:22,342 --> 00:34:22,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is.

702
00:34:22,911 --> 00:34:23,518
Speaker 0: Definitely is.

703
00:34:23,982 --> 00:34:26,500
Speaker 0: But, I liked this way more than you did for whatever reason.

704
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:30,719
Speaker 0: Like, I really enjoyed watching this again, partly because I hadn't seen it since I was a little kid.

705
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:35,420
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm just comparing it to Mickey and the Beanstalk, and it's not, it's maybe slightly more than half as good.

706
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,958
Speaker 0: Mickey and the Beanstalk is pretty good.

707
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,900
Speaker 1: It's like A+, what are you talking about?

708
00:34:40,822 --> 00:34:43,080
Speaker 0: Well, you're just obsessed with Goofy and that Jello.

709
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,000
Speaker 1: That's just the best part.

710
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:48,020
Speaker 1: That's like, that's like the, uh, you know, the platinum frosting on the golden cake.

711
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:54,080
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, the platinum frosting tasted the best, but it's still fucking golden cakes.

712
00:34:59,943 --> 00:35:02,080
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

722
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,700
Speaker 0: Seriously, though, uh, Scott Sablazane is aside.

723
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:30,060
Speaker 0: He is actually voting, and I swear to God, if you don't vote, shit's kind of bad right now.

724
00:36:31,143 --> 00:36:33,940
Speaker 0: And we just gotta hold out and swallow your pride.

725
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,720
Speaker 0: Vote for Hillary Clinton, who is the officially recommended nominee of Geek Nights.

726
00:36:38,623 --> 00:36:39,820
Speaker 0: And we'll see you on the flip side.

727
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:45,120
Speaker 0: But now, I leave you with something that has nothing to do with the election, and is simply fantastic.
