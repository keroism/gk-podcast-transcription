1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,636
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, March 17th, 2015.

2
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:12,939
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:13,620
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,023
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:17,748
Speaker 1: Tonight, the games of PAX East.

6
00:00:17,748 --> 00:00:21,531
Speaker 1: 2015.

7
00:00:21,531 --> 00:00:22,548
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:32,770
Speaker 1: God, we keep missing, like, weeks of shows at a time because, like, we get back from PAX and then I go overseas or some bullshit.

9
00:00:33,671 --> 00:00:38,970
Speaker 1: And that happened again, so the last show we did was the games of PAX South.

10
00:00:39,292 --> 00:00:42,750
Speaker 1: And I guess now it's time to talk about the games at PAX East because another PAX happened.

11
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,990
Speaker 0: There are no more PAXes until PAX Prime in September.

12
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,309
Speaker 0: In August, I guess, so it's a long time from now.

13
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,130
Speaker 1: Of course, in between, we've got ZenkaiCon, Anime Boston.

14
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,859
Speaker 0: But those are only on weekends.

15
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:55,710
Speaker 0: Those aren't overlapping any show days.

16
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,232
Speaker 0: True.

17
00:00:56,574 --> 00:00:58,509
Speaker 1: But I'm going to London again next week, so...

18
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:08,890
Speaker 0: Well, other than you going somewhere, I see no reason why, barring something else crazy happening, that we won't have a lot of usual scheduled Geek Nights episodes.

19
00:01:09,453 --> 00:01:10,346
Speaker 1: And the good news is...

20
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:11,690
Speaker 0: Between now and PAX Prime.

21
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:16,370
Speaker 1: And we'll talk about them at the moment, but we've got some stuff in the hopper that's not regular episodes.

22
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,115
Speaker 1: There's actually content on the way.

23
00:01:18,155 --> 00:01:21,790
Speaker 1: But anyway, so, Potline Miami 2 came out.

24
00:01:22,151 --> 00:01:22,748
Speaker 0: It sure did.

25
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:23,777
Speaker 1: Yeah.

26
00:01:24,564 --> 00:01:25,209
Speaker 1: Have you played it yet?

27
00:01:25,591 --> 00:01:26,133
Speaker 0: I bought it.

28
00:01:26,334 --> 00:01:26,976
Speaker 0: I preordered it.

29
00:01:27,257 --> 00:01:30,550
Speaker 0: Then I realized, like, a day after that you could install it, that I could install it.

30
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,017
Speaker 1: Yeah, I also preordered it.

31
00:01:32,137 --> 00:01:34,509
Speaker 1: I only knew that it came out because I was playing Civ V.

32
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:38,089
Speaker 0: I knew because I think someone tweeted about it, and I was like, "Oh, did that come out

33
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:38,230
Speaker 0: yet?".

34
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,408
Speaker 0: I opened up Steam and it said "Install" instead of, "This is coming out

35
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:41,669
Speaker 0: soon.".

36
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:46,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, on my flight home from London, I came back business class, so there was like a power jack on my seat and everything.

37
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:53,930
Speaker 1: So I played Civ V the whole way home, and I'm about halfway through a pretty good game, so I just kept playing it after I got home.

38
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:59,950
Speaker 1: And then I stopped the game to, like, take a break, and then that Steam news was up that you always ignore because it's just an annoying pop-up.

39
00:01:59,991 --> 00:02:00,589
Speaker 0: I turned that off.

40
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:01,514
Speaker 1: Yeah, I forgot.

41
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:04,288
Speaker 1: I just didn't think to, and it's like, "Hey, Hotline Miami

42
00:02:04,288 --> 00:02:04,891
Speaker 1: 2.".

43
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:05,817
Speaker 1: And I was like, "Oh, right.

44
00:02:06,603 --> 00:02:06,764
Speaker 1: All

45
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:07,409
Speaker 1: right.".

46
00:02:07,813 --> 00:02:09,110
Speaker 1: I was going to play it, but I didn't.

47
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:13,872
Speaker 0: So Hotline Miami 2 is disappointingly not Hotline Miami 1.

48
00:02:13,872 --> 00:02:16,170
Speaker 1: All I wanted was more Hotline Miami 1.

49
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,595
Speaker 0: It is, in a way, right?

50
00:02:17,655 --> 00:02:19,582
Speaker 0: The music is there.

51
00:02:19,642 --> 00:02:20,244
Speaker 0: It's pumping.

52
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:21,890
Speaker 0: It is pumping awesome music.

53
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:29,810
Speaker 0: But, despite it being pumping awesome music of a soundtrack that I will put and listen to on purpose outside of the game, it's that good.

54
00:02:30,611 --> 00:02:34,106
Speaker 0: There is no individual song that stands out as so amazing like

55
00:02:34,568 --> 00:02:34,970
Speaker 0: "Hydrogen.".

56
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,427
Speaker 1: I was about to say, there's no "Hydrogen"?

57
00:02:39,637 --> 00:02:40,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, that song is not in there.

58
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,689
Speaker 1: Man, I work out to that song.

59
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,596
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a good song.

60
00:02:43,657 --> 00:02:44,850
Speaker 0: Anyway, so that's number one.

61
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,530
Speaker 0: Number two, the visual style of the game has been upgraded and is amazing times a billion.

62
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:55,290
Speaker 0: It's like '80s neon... I mean, it's the same as it was before, right?

63
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,425
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I knew that...

64
00:02:56,892 --> 00:02:58,850
Speaker 0: It's the same generic, you know, aesthetic.

65
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:00,549
Speaker 1: I did play it at a PAX.

66
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,970
Speaker 0: But it's so much more polished and cranked the fuck up.

67
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I saw it at a PAX.

68
00:03:04,401 --> 00:03:05,470
Speaker 1: I played it at a PAX.

69
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,424
Speaker 0: I want to look at it all the time.

70
00:03:07,484 --> 00:03:08,110
Speaker 0: It's so good looking.

71
00:03:08,973 --> 00:03:09,788
Speaker 0: Even though it's still pixely.

72
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,089
Speaker 1: But, there's a big butt hanging over this.

73
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:12,925
Speaker 0: So the butt...

74
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,830
Speaker 1: Butt of Damocles.

75
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:21,090
Speaker 0: Is that the actual game, right, is mechanically mostly the same, right?

76
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:24,469
Speaker 0: You're still top down, walk around, hit things, knock a guy out, right?

77
00:03:25,152 --> 00:03:29,107
Speaker 0: But it seems like there have been subtle changes to the mechanics.

78
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,870
Speaker 0: You know, like in the terms of the way the doors, you know, hit a little bit.

79
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,590
Speaker 0: It feels like they've been changed slightly.

80
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,970
Speaker 1: Now that would be fine, because some of that stuff is kind of broken.

81
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,950
Speaker 0: It feels like it's been sped up a little bit.

82
00:03:41,252 --> 00:03:41,987
Speaker 1: That would be good too.

83
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:54,070
Speaker 0: But really, it's... you know how in the early... It's like they made these subtle changes, but somehow only subtly changing things has fundamentally changed what the game is about.

84
00:03:54,691 --> 00:03:57,250
Speaker 0: Hotline Miami 1 is about puzzle solving.

85
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,030
Speaker 0: Like, okay, I can take all these guys out, but what order do I do it in?

86
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:01,659
Speaker 0: Do I have to do...

87
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd be like door, door, shoot, back.

88
00:04:04,071 --> 00:04:07,070
Speaker 0: Right, okay, there's a room with three guys in it.

89
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,650
Speaker 0: I can see that one guy is walking around in a circle.

90
00:04:09,711 --> 00:04:11,829
Speaker 0: So I gotta open the door when he's next to the door.

91
00:04:12,354 --> 00:04:13,450
Speaker 0: He has a baseball bat.

92
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,889
Speaker 0: I can immediately grab that and throw it at the guy with the gun before he shoots me.

93
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,789
Speaker 0: The other guy's a melee guy, so he's gonna rush at me.

94
00:04:20,232 --> 00:04:21,428
Speaker 0: I can just punch him out.

95
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,710
Speaker 0: Then I can run over and get the gun and kill everyone, and that's how I'm gonna take this.

96
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:29,470
Speaker 0: And it's about, once you figure it out, pretty easy to execute in Hotline Miami 1.

97
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:36,948
Speaker 1: It's all about rhythm, beats, and of course, you know, the game did randomize a little bit, so it could have like 100% strategy, but it was good.

98
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:41,370
Speaker 1: It was like strategy plus tactical deviation when things don't go the way you planned.

99
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:46,490
Speaker 0: Later on, in the later levels of Hotline Miami 1, shit was balls hard, right?

100
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:50,188
Speaker 0: Where it's like, you know, you'd feel like, "Oh, that hurt really

101
00:04:50,228 --> 00:04:50,570
Speaker 0: bad."

102
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,139
Speaker 0: Or, "Oh man, this is so frustrating.

103
00:04:52,179 --> 00:04:53,788
Speaker 0: I can't do this even though I figured it

104
00:04:53,969 --> 00:04:54,050
Speaker 0: out.".

105
00:04:54,170 --> 00:05:00,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, there were one or two where I'd wait until like Arundo had a knife, and then I could do it, and I couldn't really unless I got that knife.

106
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:01,471
Speaker 0: Yup.

107
00:05:02,032 --> 00:05:13,630
Speaker 0: So, Hotline Miami 2 is pretty much, instead of like having the same sort of, you know, curve from, you know, easy to hard, it just pretty much picks off where Hotline Miami 1 left off in terms of hard.

108
00:05:13,871 --> 00:05:15,395
Speaker 1: Now, that I like.

109
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:20,450
Speaker 1: It's not good for the game or gamers as a whole, but it's good for me.

110
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:25,870
Speaker 1: It's like the problem when I play a new Advance Wars and the whole first half of the game is completely stupid.

111
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:26,729
Speaker 0: That is true.

112
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:28,549
Speaker 1: See, also, Metroidvanias.

113
00:05:29,611 --> 00:05:29,906
Speaker 0: Sort of.

114
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:30,366
Speaker 1: Yeah.

115
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:36,610
Speaker 0: But, the other problem is that it's just sort of unfairly hard, right?

116
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:41,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, I saw like Mitchie D tweeted something to the effect of most of his deaths were off-screen gunshots.

117
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:43,498
Speaker 0: Yes, most of my deaths are off-screen gunshots.

118
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:52,110
Speaker 0: For example, it's like, there's a spot where it's like, okay, you can press shift and move the mouse around to see farther, but there's a limit to how far you can see.

119
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,300
Speaker 0: So, I can see like, okay, I'm going into a hallway.

120
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,726
Speaker 0: There's a guy patrolling.

121
00:05:56,766 --> 00:05:57,630
Speaker 0: He comes near the door.

122
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,000
Speaker 0: I just have to open the door when he's near it.

123
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,170
Speaker 0: The hallway is otherwise empty.

124
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:03,660
Speaker 0: At the other end of the hallway, I can see that there's a window, right?

125
00:06:04,142 --> 00:06:06,088
Speaker 0: But, I can't see farther than the window.

126
00:06:07,513 --> 00:06:09,389
Speaker 0: So, there's nothing I can really do about that.

127
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,554
Speaker 0: So, I wait for the guy to come.

128
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:11,918
Speaker 0: I push the door down.

129
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:15,630
Speaker 0: I grab the guy's weapon, and then I try to go and seek cover.

130
00:06:16,351 --> 00:06:20,200
Speaker 0: While I'm seeking cover, bullets come through that window.

131
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:36,090
Speaker 0: that was so far away, because now that I've moved like a very small amount, I've now moved to in range of that window, and this line of sight from this bad guy with a gun beyond that window, who has instant, basically all the bad guys are crazy fast and have perfect aimbots.

132
00:06:36,471 --> 00:06:44,250
Speaker 1: See now, at least in one, there are a small number of places that were like that, but that was like a turret in Portal 2.

133
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,919
Speaker 0: This is like the beginning of the goddamn game.

134
00:06:46,979 --> 00:07:06,910
Speaker 0: So far, every level has at least one or two bullshit spots, where you sort of just get killed by guys that are off-screen that you couldn't know about, and you can either go ridiculously slowly and still fail occasionally, or just go for it until eventually you manage to not get killed by some bullshit.

135
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:22,510
Speaker 1: This is actually kind of disappointing, because it's much like how Bionic Commando Rearmed was amazing, and then they made a sequel that just had that little jump hop, and they changed a few little mechanics, and the game just wasn't spiritually true to the thing I actually liked.

136
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:26,750
Speaker 1: See also, every WarioWare before or after the GameCube one.

137
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:30,570
Speaker 0: So I mean, it's not an awful game, it's still Hotline Miami, right?

138
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,548
Speaker 1: I'll still play it.

139
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:43,336
Speaker 0: It's just not as good as Hotline Miami 1, you know, it's not going, it's not gonna like, if it had, the thing is, if it had been as good, it would have like turned this into like an epic series of like, "Oh my god, where's Hotline Miami 3?

140
00:07:43,336 --> 00:07:43,517
Speaker 0: Let's

141
00:07:43,537 --> 00:07:43,858
Speaker 0: go.".

142
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,481
Speaker 0: Right?

143
00:07:44,521 --> 00:07:46,630
Speaker 0: This shit is for reals, it's not gonna stop.

144
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:48,350
Speaker 1: Maybe they hit their sophomore slump.

145
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:53,364
Speaker 0: Right, like it would have been, you know, a new, you know, whole category, right?

146
00:07:53,444 --> 00:07:55,350
Speaker 0: Like Zelda or Mario is a category.

147
00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:02,769
Speaker 1: Well I mean, look at the longevity, of course it kind of petered out and stopped, of the Castlevania, Metroidvania games, like they died now, like they don't really come out anymore, but...

148
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:06,030
Speaker 0: They're not dead though, everyone wants them, just no one fucking makes them.

149
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they're dead, see also all the kinds of games we like.

150
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,527
Speaker 0: Make Symphony of the Day or some shit, or...

151
00:08:12,252 --> 00:08:15,770
Speaker 1: But, those games are all pretty much identical.

152
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,969
Speaker 0: Super Ridley, I don't know.

153
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,349
Speaker 1: Yeah, and yet, I like the shit out of every one of them.

154
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:33,650
Speaker 1: So, I feel like unless you are like one of those like auteur game designers, and you have like this brilliant vision of like how to push a game in a different direction or a new direction, don't make a Zelda 2, just make Mario 3.

155
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:33,750
Speaker 0: Yes.

156
00:08:34,116 --> 00:08:34,230
Speaker 1: Yes.

157
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:34,765
Speaker 0: Yes.

158
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:40,789
Speaker 1: So wait, what I said was don't make an okay game, make literally one of the greatest games ever made in the history of gaming.

159
00:08:41,794 --> 00:08:42,749
Speaker 1: Just do that and you'll be fine.

160
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the thing, is they made a sequel, right?

161
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:50,592
Speaker 0: And when you make a sequel to say Super Mario Brothers, your sequel is supposed to be Mario 3.

162
00:08:50,592 --> 00:08:54,364
Speaker 0: Right, so the Hotline Miami 2 should have been the Hotline to Mario 3 to Mario 1, right?

163
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:01,610
Speaker 1: Or it could have been the Mario 2 Doki Doki Panic style, because that, or you know, the Zelda 2...

164
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,029
Speaker 0: Everyone would have just been like, wow, this is nothing like, you know...

165
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:11,990
Speaker 1: Yes, and everyone was like, wow, you know, in the US, Mario quote unquote 2 is nothing like Mario 1, and yet it still was a super popular game.

166
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,310
Speaker 0: It wasn't Mario 3.

167
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,450
Speaker 1: Well, Mario 3 didn't come out yet.

168
00:09:14,774 --> 00:09:15,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

169
00:09:16,111 --> 00:09:20,249
Speaker 1: Yeah, they both are in the canon of Mario and they're both great games.

170
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,849
Speaker 0: Yeah, Doki Doki Panic is not a great game.

171
00:09:23,031 --> 00:09:23,689
Speaker 0: It's a great game.

172
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,243
Speaker 0: Anyway.

173
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:24,928
Speaker 1: Play it again.

174
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:28,090
Speaker 1: Don't play the shitty remakes that turned it into baby mode.

175
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:28,790
Speaker 0: How about that Wart?

176
00:09:30,314 --> 00:09:30,725
Speaker 0: Four minutes?

177
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,130
Speaker 0: Four minutes to beat Wart?

178
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,189
Speaker 1: Why are there four minutes left?

179
00:09:33,971 --> 00:09:36,250
Speaker 1: I've been watching more Retsupreis, they're pretty good.

180
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:37,128
Speaker 1: They're okay, guys.

181
00:09:38,091 --> 00:09:40,486
Speaker 1: So, the game that I played that's new...

182
00:09:41,271 --> 00:09:52,547
Speaker 0: If you're going to play Hotline Miami 2 and you like... If you already played Hotline Miami 1 and beat it, and you're good, and you want to play Hotline Miami 2 because you haven't had enough, wait for the price to go down, because I think I paid like 15 bucks.

183
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,550
Speaker 0: Probably it's going to be $5 during the Steam of Sale.

184
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,570
Speaker 1: It sounds like if you haven't played Hotline Miami 1, what the fuck?

185
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,348
Speaker 1: Just go play that.

186
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,090
Speaker 0: How come you didn't get that in the Steam of Sale?

187
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,949
Speaker 1: I mean, you might say, but Riven Scott...

188
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,010
Speaker 0: That game is still amazing.

189
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:11,270
Speaker 1: But Riven Scott, that game is uncomfortably violent, and the answer is yes, it is really uncomfortably violent.

190
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:16,410
Speaker 0: The new one, actually, when you first load it up, it says the sexual violence, do you want those scenes to not appear?

191
00:10:16,631 --> 00:10:16,927
Speaker 0: Yes, no.

192
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:21,250
Speaker 1: You know, that's a good thing that they did, I think.

193
00:10:21,731 --> 00:10:27,389
Speaker 1: Because there are people who otherwise couldn't play the game, or would play the game, and then have a bad time.

194
00:10:27,871 --> 00:10:28,930
Speaker 1: So, it's a lot like X-Card.

195
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:31,109
Speaker 1: I wish more games did things like that.

196
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:35,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not like we're going to remove this stuff entirely from the game.

197
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:41,990
Speaker 0: It's like... It's not like a movie where you can't choose, everyone has to watch the same movie, right?

198
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,950
Speaker 0: Why not let people customize the experience in that way?

199
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:53,250
Speaker 0: But also, why not let people customize the experience in ways that aren't related to sex, violence, disturbing, possibly offensive things?

200
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,530
Speaker 1: What, you mean like difficulty mode, like easy mode or good mode?

201
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,270
Speaker 0: Well, difficulty is one way.

202
00:10:57,796 --> 00:10:58,749
Speaker 1: I mean, one, why not?

203
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:05,030
Speaker 1: Because adding options like that is a huge, huge investment from design and development.

204
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:05,728
Speaker 0: Did you hear?

205
00:11:05,871 --> 00:11:08,730
Speaker 0: So, Blizzard is coming out with this Overwatch game, which is basically...

206
00:11:08,832 --> 00:11:09,630
Speaker 1: I heard about Overwatch.

207
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:17,330
Speaker 0: It's basically their Team Fortress clone, and it's a Team Fortress clone, but made by Blizzard, so it's going to be super polished and whatever, right?

208
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,829
Speaker 1: Yep, they have to go in a slightly different direction.

209
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,463
Speaker 1: This seems to be...

210
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:28,870
Speaker 0: Blizzard's new thing seems to be, look at every genre of game that's popular and make the best, like, you know, super polished, with all our knowledge and skills, game in that genre.

211
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:32,830
Speaker 1: Which is interesting, because Valve also makes the super polished games.

212
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,110
Speaker 0: Valve and Blizzard are pretty much going head-to-head lately.

213
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:37,269
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the fact that Valve and Blizzard have...

214
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,089
Speaker 0: In every category.

215
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:39,807
Speaker 1: Yeah, well both have...

216
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,146
Speaker 0: Dota versus Heroes of the Storm, right?

217
00:11:43,151 --> 00:11:44,583
Speaker 0: Now you've got Overwatch versus TF2, it's on.

218
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:46,088
Speaker 0: Anyway, this game...

219
00:11:46,211 --> 00:11:55,470
Speaker 1: If you want to do a good panel at a convention, and you want to beat us to the punch, compare the two headliners in each genre from these two companies from a design perspective.

220
00:11:56,051 --> 00:12:11,290
Speaker 0: Anyway, the reason I thought of Overwatch just now is because there was a very ripe discussion about the FOV of the game, which is being locked in at, I think, less than 90.

221
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:11,790
Speaker 0: Well, fuck it.

222
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,970
Speaker 0: I think it was like 60 or 75 or something.

223
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,649
Speaker 1: Fuck it, never mind, not playing it.

224
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,629
Speaker 0: And you can't change that shit.

225
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,480
Speaker 1: I mean, come on, 120, guys.

226
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,209
Speaker 1: Like, we have wide monitors these days.

227
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,729
Speaker 0: But they, you know, they talked about why they decided to set it at that spot, because, you know...

228
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:30,389
Speaker 1: Well, Hitler can talk a lot about why he did what he did, too.

229
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:32,890
Speaker 0: They don't want people to have a competitive advantage.

230
00:12:33,071 --> 00:12:34,028
Speaker 1: Because they're better.

231
00:12:34,635 --> 00:12:36,309
Speaker 0: Because they don't get motion sick.

232
00:12:36,691 --> 00:12:37,850
Speaker 1: I don't care about that aspect.

233
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:42,368
Speaker 0: They didn't want it to be a game about being able to see a super quick, clicky game, you know.

234
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:43,308
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know.

235
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,049
Speaker 0: Excuses for not making the game that everyone should make.

236
00:12:46,591 --> 00:12:50,990
Speaker 1: The problem is, if they make the game that everyone should make, it becomes Quake 3.

237
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:51,748
Speaker 1: I mean, unless you...

238
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,190
Speaker 0: What's wrong with Quake 3?

239
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,550
Speaker 1: Have you played Quake 3 recently?

240
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,348
Speaker 0: I played Quake Live.

241
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,930
Speaker 1: It's not an old man's game.

242
00:12:57,432 --> 00:12:58,149
Speaker 0: No, it is not.

243
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,449
Speaker 1: It is a young man's game.

244
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,650
Speaker 0: Overwatch is not an old man's game either, though.

245
00:13:02,373 --> 00:13:03,450
Speaker 1: It's more of an old man's game.

246
00:13:03,511 --> 00:13:04,729
Speaker 0: It is definitely more of an old man's game.

247
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:06,308
Speaker 1: Maybe we should play it.

248
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:11,788
Speaker 1: I mean, as much as I like to say, it's like saying, like, "Yeah, I really want to drive the, like, GTR.

249
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:13,042
Speaker 1: I want to drive the F1

250
00:13:13,103 --> 00:13:13,164
Speaker 1: car.".

251
00:13:13,812 --> 00:13:15,830
Speaker 1: But in reality, I don't actually want to drive the F1 car.

252
00:13:16,031 --> 00:13:19,822
Speaker 0: If you sat in the F1 car, and you touched the gas pedal, you would die instantly.

253
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:20,986
Speaker 0: That's it.

254
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:24,890
Speaker 1: I want to say that I want the F1 car, but the reality is, I'm too old for that game.

255
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:28,930
Speaker 0: Like, if we just, you know, put you in the seat, and then a feather hit the gas pedal, you would die.

256
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:36,170
Speaker 1: So, I played Five Nights at Freddy's 3 because of peer pressure.

257
00:13:36,892 --> 00:13:38,089
Speaker 1: I wasn't really going to play it like that.

258
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,990
Speaker 0: Five Nights at Freddy's is like your favorite thing.

259
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:40,769
Speaker 0: You're obsessed with it.

260
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:41,629
Speaker 0: You played one and two.

261
00:13:42,172 --> 00:13:42,867
Speaker 0: I didn't play two.

262
00:13:43,837 --> 00:13:44,329
Speaker 1: I thought you did.

263
00:13:45,113 --> 00:13:46,190
Speaker 1: I had to watch a YouTube video.

264
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,428
Speaker 1: I know everything I need to know about two.

265
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,069
Speaker 1: Okay.

266
00:13:48,591 --> 00:13:57,629
Speaker 1: I am obsessed with one because, remember, most people, like even gamers, don't really know about that game, and people who aren't like the Scott-- I don't know.

267
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,729
Speaker 0: I heard about it from my coworkers, or I heard about it from you.

268
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:01,430
Speaker 0: People know about that game.

269
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,910
Speaker 0: You think that, but then like in Australia-- My sister even made a Let's Play video of that game.

270
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:13,608
Speaker 1: Yeah, but like in Australia, like how many people have heard of this game, and one person raised their hand, and like none of our friends who aren't like listening to us and heard about it until I made them play it.

271
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:18,810
Speaker 1: But, so anyway, Five Nights at Freddy's 3, it came out suddenly.

272
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,449
Speaker 1: You know, the guy, Scott Cawthorne-- That guy is cranking him out.

273
00:14:21,711 --> 00:14:23,810
Speaker 1: That guy knows what he's doing.

274
00:14:24,491 --> 00:14:26,996
Speaker 1: So, it came out suddenly like, "Yo, guys, it's here.

275
00:14:27,056 --> 00:14:27,319
Speaker 1: It's here.

276
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:27,742
Speaker 1: Let's go.

277
00:14:27,843 --> 00:14:28,165
Speaker 1: Just buy

278
00:14:28,206 --> 00:14:28,266
Speaker 1: it.".

279
00:14:29,073 --> 00:14:30,769
Speaker 1: And I tweeted like, "Hey, should I play

280
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:30,849
Speaker 1: it?".

281
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,887
Speaker 1: And a bunch of people were like, "Fuck

282
00:14:31,907 --> 00:14:32,050
Speaker 1: yeah.".

283
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,228
Speaker 1: So I made a Let's Play, and I played it.

284
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:45,590
Speaker 1: And to review it, because I know Scott doesn't really care, if you like these kinds of games, like a good horror experience, don't try to get good at them because they're stupid if you get good at them.

285
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:46,550
Speaker 1: They're experiences.

286
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,469
Speaker 1: Play them like a haunted house and be done with them.

287
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,410
Speaker 1: Play one, and then play three.

288
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:56,430
Speaker 1: I don't think two is actually probably that good of a game if you want that kind of experience.

289
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,269
Speaker 0: But won't you not know the story if you don't play two?

290
00:14:59,653 --> 00:15:04,670
Speaker 1: Unless you really pay attention, you're not going to learn the story fully from playing the game.

291
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:18,830
Speaker 1: You're going to learn the story from playing the game and seeing Springtrap's death and all this stuff, and then you're going to go to some Wikia and just read what other people figured out because you've got to do some crazy bullshit to actually, actually find out what happened to those kids.

292
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:26,110
Speaker 1: The lore and the story is actually pretty good, but I think the reason I want to talk about the game, now that three came out, and I don't think he'll make a fourth one.

293
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,610
Speaker 1: I think he'll make a different kind of game after this.

294
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:29,550
Speaker 0: You don't know what he's thinking.

295
00:15:30,034 --> 00:15:33,909
Speaker 1: I don't at all, but as a trilogy, it's kind of like Cowboy Bebop.

296
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,910
Speaker 1: There's a really contig--.

297
00:15:36,212 --> 00:15:41,610
Speaker 1: Obviously, he made a pretty contiguous, defined story, but he doesn't just tell you the story.

298
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:45,889
Speaker 1: The story is just used as a consistent backdrop for the rest of the game.

299
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:56,064
Speaker 1: I like it when horror games do things like that, like an Eva style of, "I tell you what you need to know because I'm actually trying to make you experience

300
00:15:56,084 --> 00:15:56,104
Speaker 1: X.".

301
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:00,550
Speaker 1: How we got there and who the Purple Man really is is not that important.

302
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:04,889
Speaker 1: The fact that he exists and there is a consistent-- Is the Purple Man in Five Guys at Freddy's?

303
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:10,790
Speaker 1: The Purple Man is basically-- So in three, there's the suit, right?

304
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:11,638
Speaker 1: There's the suit.

305
00:16:11,658 --> 00:16:13,889
Speaker 1: There's only one suit, and it's in the place with you.

306
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,149
Speaker 1: And if it sees you, it just comes in and just kills you.

307
00:16:16,772 --> 00:16:26,469
Speaker 1: But the story is basically to summarize and assume a lot that there's this guy who was luring little kids into a back room and just murdering them.

308
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:27,572
Speaker 1: Yeah.

309
00:16:27,773 --> 00:16:31,048
Speaker 1: Well, so there are at least two murderers between the two games.

310
00:16:32,054 --> 00:16:33,590
Speaker 1: One of them was probably a pedophile.

311
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:35,850
Speaker 1: I think the suits got him.

312
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:41,489
Speaker 1: But anyway, so the suits, in the old days, there were golden suits that you could wear.

313
00:16:42,072 --> 00:16:50,968
Speaker 1: And to wear them, you had to crank the spring thing, and it would pull back under tension all the AI animatronic bits, and then you could get into the suit.

314
00:16:51,812 --> 00:16:57,009
Speaker 1: And they were prone to catastrophic failure, and they would just explode back into you and just crush your guts.

315
00:16:58,092 --> 00:17:07,470
Speaker 1: So the dude killed all these kids, and then the ghost of the kids confronted him, scared him, and he put on the suit to try to get away from them, and then died in the suit and all this cool stuff.

316
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:22,210
Speaker 1: But anyway, the game, actually, in terms of horror, it does horror very well and in a much more polished fashion than Five Nights at Freddy's 1, but it does the same kinds of things.

317
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:29,309
Speaker 1: There's a door on the left that's open, and you have to look way to the right to pull out the camera to see what's going on.

318
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:35,745
Speaker 1: But behind the camera, you can see through this window into the hallway outside, and you'll see something walk by the window, and you're like, "Oh,

319
00:17:35,766 --> 00:17:35,868
Speaker 1: fuck!".

320
00:17:36,072 --> 00:17:39,869
Speaker 1: And you're trying to fumble out of the camera and look left and see if something's in the door.

321
00:17:40,335 --> 00:17:46,970
Speaker 1: And in a stroke of genius, outside that door, all the time, is a mannequin of a busted Freddy.

322
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:53,485
Speaker 1: So you always turn and you see it there, and you know it's there, but every time you turn, you're like, "Whoa!

323
00:17:53,747 --> 00:17:54,110
Speaker 1: All right.

324
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:54,934
Speaker 1: "Right.

325
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:55,703
Speaker 1: Thanks,

326
00:17:55,764 --> 00:17:56,128
Speaker 1: Scott.".

327
00:17:56,452 --> 00:17:57,970
Speaker 0: Hey, look at your right-hand screen.

328
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:58,572
Speaker 1: No.

329
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:00,828
Speaker 1: Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

330
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,327
Speaker 1: They're actually... Okay.

331
00:18:05,456 --> 00:18:06,429
Speaker 0: No one can see this.

332
00:18:06,851 --> 00:18:07,710
Speaker 1: Thanks, Wikia.

333
00:18:09,914 --> 00:18:12,790
Speaker 1: I guess that's the puppet master carrying a dead child somewhere.

334
00:18:16,094 --> 00:18:18,828
Speaker 1: So, yeah, if you like those kinds of games, play one and three.

335
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,968
Speaker 1: Two is more of a stress game instead of a horror game.

336
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,660
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

337
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:43,499
Speaker 1: I have a thing of the day that I practically guarantee none of you have seen unless you subscribe to my like stream on YouTube 'cause I just liked this video like a couple hours ago.

338
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:51,878
Speaker 1: So basically, this dude, Furious Paul, who only has like 100 subscribers, this video has less than 1,000 views, doesn't seem like super well-known yet.

339
00:18:52,621 --> 00:18:56,359
Speaker 1: He seems to be one of those like play games quickly, be good at games guys.

340
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:05,279
Speaker 1: And he demonstrates an amazing glitch in Castlevania 2, the likes of which I have never seen before.

341
00:19:07,181 --> 00:19:18,780
Speaker 1: Basically, you can get into a crazy glitched out area that is fully navigable and it is possible to traverse from that, which is an expansive giant area, back into the game.

342
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,960
Speaker 0: So it's similar to the Metroid 1 glitches where you get in the door and then jump up the side of the wall.

343
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:28,520
Speaker 1: It is, except there's way more traversable stuff in there for some reason.

344
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:32,428
Speaker 1: And at one point, he falls into what looks like an infinite loop and he's like, "Ah,

345
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,016
Speaker 1: alright.".

346
00:19:33,462 --> 00:19:34,776
Speaker 1: And he's like, "I'm gonna see if this goes

347
00:19:34,836 --> 00:19:35,120
Speaker 1: anywhere.".

348
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:37,120
Speaker 1: And he gets up and goes to the bathroom.

349
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:44,599
Speaker 1: No, it just keeps falling and falling and falling and falling and falling and falling and falling and bam, lands on a platform and then he just keeps going.

350
00:19:47,267 --> 00:19:48,099
Speaker 1: This was pretty cool.

351
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:53,600
Speaker 1: And I'm gonna see what this guy's up to because I kind of like his Let's Play style.

352
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,679
Speaker 0: So I just learned about this dude.

353
00:19:56,482 --> 00:19:57,759
Speaker 0: His name is Takanoyama.

354
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,120
Speaker 1: Takanoyama?

355
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,999
Speaker 0: He's a Czechoslovakian dude.

356
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,020
Speaker 0: But he was a sumo wrestler.

357
00:20:03,523 --> 00:20:05,000
Speaker 0: His sumo name was Takanoyama.

358
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,271
Speaker 0: I don't know what his real name was.

359
00:20:06,352 --> 00:20:06,978
Speaker 0: It was something else.

360
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:18,280
Speaker 0: And this dude did not look like a sumo wrestler because, I mean, he had his hair all sumo'd and he had the underwear or whatever.

361
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:24,339
Speaker 0: But he tried to become huge but he couldn't become huge even though he tried a whole lot.

362
00:20:25,061 --> 00:20:28,180
Speaker 0: But he was like an awesome judo wrestling kind of dude.

363
00:20:28,965 --> 00:20:31,320
Speaker 0: So it's not like he became the Yokozuna or anything.

364
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,720
Speaker 0: But he won enough to get into the top category a few times.

365
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,820
Speaker 1: So he's still a contender.

366
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, he was like in best 30 in the world at one point.

367
00:20:40,802 --> 00:20:43,900
Speaker 0: And he sort of bounced around between the top level and the second highest level.

368
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,059
Speaker 0: And he did really well.

369
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:54,200
Speaker 0: But it's just awesome to see a dude who is not a humongous sumo wrestler basically throw humongous sumo wrestlers right out of the ring.

370
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,059
Speaker 1: Yeah, because all you gotta do is get that guy out of the ring however you do it.

371
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,120
Speaker 0: So if you look at his, you can see the truth of his career.

372
00:21:00,381 --> 00:21:03,078
Speaker 0: This video makes him look amazing because only his highlight's real.

373
00:21:03,841 --> 00:21:08,060
Speaker 0: Which is amazingly entertaining because you're seeing a non-huge dude throw around huge dudes.

374
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,899
Speaker 0: But if you look on Wikipedia about him, you can see his real record.

375
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,840
Speaker 0: Which is not bad, but it's not like he's the king of all time or anything.

376
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:23,319
Speaker 0: But still, really awesome video to watch to see a non-fat dude deal with giant fat dudes in an amazing way.

377
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,759
Speaker 1: So in the meta moment, the book club book is...

378
00:21:26,961 --> 00:21:29,780
Speaker 0: Sumo wrestling would be awesome if it wasn't corrupt and Yakuza shit.

379
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,465
Speaker 1: That is true.

380
00:21:30,486 --> 00:21:31,740
Speaker 1: You could say that about a lot of things.

381
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:36,220
Speaker 1: The book club book is still Watership Down, the story of rabbits.

382
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,360
Speaker 0: Oh, I should do something about that.

383
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,166
Speaker 1: On an epic adventure.

384
00:21:38,206 --> 00:21:39,999
Speaker 1: I've already picked my next book club book, so...

385
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,859
Speaker 0: I have too, but I have to finish this one.

386
00:21:42,462 --> 00:21:43,933
Speaker 1: My next one is going to be The Forever War, so...

387
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,519
Speaker 0: What's that?

388
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,699
Speaker 1: Well, you'll find out because you're going to read it.

389
00:21:48,001 --> 00:21:48,279
Speaker 1: Great.

390
00:21:49,421 --> 00:21:53,253
Speaker 1: So in the meta moment, otherwise, we are going to be this coming weekend in...

391
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,099
Speaker 0: I thought it's the next weekend.

392
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,939
Speaker 1: Well, we're in a weekend right now.

393
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:00,986
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

394
00:22:01,027 --> 00:22:01,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're right.

395
00:22:02,061 --> 00:22:04,180
Speaker 1: Because we're recording this show ahead, but not that far ahead.

396
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,034
Speaker 1: So next weekend...

397
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:06,937
Speaker 0: Which dates?

398
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,351
Speaker 1: The 27th... Well, the 28th and 29th...

399
00:22:10,683 --> 00:22:11,038
Speaker 0: Of March.

400
00:22:11,264 --> 00:22:11,620
Speaker 1: Of March.

401
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,160
Speaker 1: We are going to be in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

402
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,260
Speaker 0: We're actually probably not going to be there on Friday till way late.

403
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:18,340
Speaker 0: Check Saturday and Sunday.

404
00:22:18,883 --> 00:22:19,145
Speaker 1: Yeah.

405
00:22:19,246 --> 00:22:20,580
Speaker 1: At a convention called Zank icon.

406
00:22:20,982 --> 00:22:25,000
Speaker 1: And we're doing not one, not two, not three, not five, but FOUR lectures.

407
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,059
Speaker 0: Five is right out.

408
00:22:27,861 --> 00:22:32,280
Speaker 1: On Saturday, we're doing How to Win Every Game and Short Form Anime.

409
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,900
Speaker 1: So, like, Damek Adobezu type shit.

410
00:22:35,481 --> 00:22:42,920
Speaker 1: And then on Sunday, we're doing Why No One Will Game With You and Anime Openers From Around the World.

411
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,780
Speaker 1: Completely revamped.

412
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,113
Speaker 1: I found some, like, Italian Lupin.

413
00:22:47,134 --> 00:22:48,100
Speaker 1: that'll make you cry.

414
00:22:49,084 --> 00:22:49,356
Speaker 0: Will it?

415
00:22:49,763 --> 00:22:50,328
Speaker 1: It might.

416
00:22:50,409 --> 00:22:51,297
Speaker 1: It's really bad.

417
00:22:53,526 --> 00:22:54,157
Speaker 1: And we're going to be!

418
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,239
Speaker 1: The weekend immediately after that.

419
00:22:56,822 --> 00:22:57,389
Speaker 1: In Boston.

420
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,320
Speaker 1: At Anime Boston.

421
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,820
Speaker 1: Performing a bunch of panels, I assume.

422
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,040
Speaker 1: They haven't really finalized the schedule yet, so I can't say what or when.

423
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,500
Speaker 1: But none of our panels will be Friday morning because we're not actually getting there till Friday afternoon.

424
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,359
Speaker 0: Well, if they don't, then we just won't go.

425
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,999
Speaker 0: We'll just cancel our hotel room and not go.

426
00:23:13,701 --> 00:23:15,573
Speaker 1: Well, all our panels are 9, 10, 11, and 12 a.m.

427
00:23:16,842 --> 00:23:17,492
Speaker 1: And 12 p.m.

428
00:23:17,614 --> 00:23:17,960
Speaker 1: on Friday.

429
00:23:20,002 --> 00:23:30,260
Speaker 1: But I imagine we'll be doing, as we've done every year since we started this tradition, among other panels, judge anime by its cover, where we'll judge the coming season of anime entirely by its cover.

430
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:40,659
Speaker 1: However, I was already wrong about one, because based on its cover, Maria, the Virgin Witch, I thought was going to be a really bad show and is actually really funny and slayers-like.

431
00:23:41,406 --> 00:23:41,820
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

432
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:46,619
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the problem is-- But we're going to be talking about the next season, so don't worry about the ones you already messed up.

433
00:23:46,961 --> 00:23:52,839
Speaker 1: Had we judged this season that I'm watching right now by that, there's one we might have been wrong on.

434
00:23:53,422 --> 00:23:54,151
Speaker 0: I mean, we're not 100% perfect.

435
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,760
Speaker 1: Well, in the first, the inaugural one, we were wrong about one show, and that show was Sailor Moon Crystal.

436
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,839
Speaker 1: We thought it would be good.

437
00:24:01,585 --> 00:24:02,639
Speaker 0: I didn't think it would be good.

438
00:24:03,522 --> 00:24:06,700
Speaker 0: I mean, there's a recording of me of what I said, so I don't remember.

439
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,799
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know why I said that?

440
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,099
Speaker 0: But I pretty much remember being skep.

441
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:12,640
Speaker 1: Well, we were skep because it hadn't come out yet.

442
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,720
Speaker 1: It had been delayed heavily.

443
00:24:14,182 --> 00:24:18,540
Speaker 1: But I tweeted a while ago, I was like, "Hey, it's been a couple years.

444
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,754
Speaker 1: Were we wrong about any of

445
00:24:19,794 --> 00:24:19,976
Speaker 1: these?".

446
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,697
Speaker 1: And two people said, "Feeling salty about Sailor

447
00:24:22,717 --> 00:24:22,939
Speaker 1: Moon.".

448
00:24:23,242 --> 00:24:24,719
Speaker 1: So I think we were wrong about that one.

449
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:25,209
Speaker 0: Maybe.

450
00:24:26,941 --> 00:24:28,960
Speaker 1: Otherwise, I assume we're going to be at PAX Prime.

451
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,840
Speaker 1: Start paying attention for hotels and badges and all that because they sell out faster than pretty much any con.

452
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:39,860
Speaker 0: PAX Prime badges and hotels go on sale really goddamn soon, perhaps this week.

453
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,638
Speaker 1: Yep, keep the eyes out.

454
00:24:42,945 --> 00:24:43,900
Speaker 0: And visit us on the internet.

455
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,939
Speaker 0: There's a lot of places on the internet that you can find us.

456
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,080
Speaker 0: Your Twitters, your Facebooks, our official website, our official forum.

457
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,220
Speaker 0: Twitter is everywhere.

458
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:56,020
Speaker 1: Our forums have been smoking lately, too, and there's some amazing gamergates trying to argue their case.

459
00:24:56,681 --> 00:24:59,640
Speaker 1: It's like a bunch of, I don't want to say rabbits in the lion's den.

460
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,560
Speaker 0: Our forum is not a place that a gamergate wants to go.

461
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:07,360
Speaker 0: That would be like someone with a sensitive nose going to the trash dump.

462
00:25:08,044 --> 00:25:13,379
Speaker 1: It is interesting because they... I give those two gentlemen points for persistence.

463
00:25:16,428 --> 00:25:17,179
Speaker 1: If nothing else.

464
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:24,540
Speaker 0: Well, they haven't actually said something absolutely horrible that we would have to ban them.

465
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,780
Speaker 0: They've just revealed that they're awful people.

466
00:25:28,382 --> 00:25:31,739
Speaker 1: Still funny how none of those people have appeared at any conventions that we've been to.

467
00:25:32,709 --> 00:25:33,179
Speaker 0: Fancy that.

468
00:25:34,143 --> 00:25:39,700
Speaker 1: So we just were at a PAX, we're at another PAX, and it's time to talk about the games we played at PAX East.

469
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:52,080
Speaker 0: So despite this PAX East having to do panel and do enforcing and all kinds of stuff and play a bunch of wizard and games we've already played, I actually saw and played a lot of new games at this PAX.

470
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:52,493
Speaker 1: Yeah.

471
00:25:53,103 --> 00:25:56,873
Speaker 0: And when I got home I was like, "Wow, I did play a bunch of new games at this PAX.

472
00:25:56,893 --> 00:25:57,598
Speaker 0: There's a lot to talk

473
00:25:57,638 --> 00:25:57,879
Speaker 0: about.".

474
00:25:58,201 --> 00:26:01,940
Speaker 1: In fact, we're only going to talk about a subset of the games that stood out at this PAX.

475
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:02,560
Speaker 0: Yep.

476
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:07,180
Speaker 1: So I think what we're doing is we're basically not talking about the games that stood out in a bad way.

477
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:11,660
Speaker 0: No, the bad games don't even get stuck in the memory to be talked about.

478
00:26:12,161 --> 00:26:15,380
Speaker 0: And there's a lot of games that we saw that were good that were just repeats, right?

479
00:26:16,001 --> 00:26:16,518
Speaker 0: Video ball.

480
00:26:17,781 --> 00:26:19,127
Speaker 0: There you are again, video ball.

481
00:26:19,147 --> 00:26:20,935
Speaker 0: I've played you for three PAXes in a row.

482
00:26:21,015 --> 00:26:22,060
Speaker 0: Please get released already.

483
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:29,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, but basically I realized that I can tell now if a game is going to live up to its potential or not.

484
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:38,460
Speaker 1: immediately without even looking at the screen, just walk past its booth, if there are marketing type people aggressively selling you on it, Bad.

485
00:26:38,941 --> 00:26:45,800
Speaker 1: It's guaranteed bad because the best games like video ball, the game is just selling itself and they're just standing there watching.

486
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:54,819
Speaker 0: There are also a lot of, especially in the indie games area, which is where all the things you have to pay attention to are because there's nothing to pay attention to in the big industry area at all.

487
00:26:56,286 --> 00:26:59,200
Speaker 0: A lot of the games are starting to just look like rehash, whatever.

488
00:26:59,721 --> 00:27:05,300
Speaker 0: I'm like, oh, there's another pixelated, stylized Metroidvania game that's not as good as Super Metroid.

489
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,260
Speaker 0: Don't need to play that.

490
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:06,521
Speaker 1: Yep.

491
00:27:06,642 --> 00:27:08,360
Speaker 1: Oh, look, it's Ghetto Smash Brothers.

492
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:10,310
Speaker 0: Oh, look, it's another shmup.

493
00:27:10,652 --> 00:27:11,880
Speaker 0: Okay, I'm done with that.

494
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,559
Speaker 1: Ooh, someone's trying to make a MOBA.

495
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:14,225
Speaker 0: Yeah.

496
00:27:15,061 --> 00:27:15,598
Speaker 1: Indie MOBA.

497
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,460
Speaker 0: Here's another crappy iOS mobily game.

498
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,900
Speaker 1: It is amazing how many people buy a for real booth.

499
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:28,496
Speaker 1: Not an indie booth, but like a for real big money booth to show off their like 99 cent iOS game.

500
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,680
Speaker 1: Like, guys, those games are not that good.

501
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,760
Speaker 1: I can't imagine you get 10,000 sales because you're at PAX.

502
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:43,840
Speaker 0: There was a game that basically looked like Magical Drop and I was like, ooh, and it's like, no, it was way worse than any, I mean, it was a puzzle game.

503
00:27:43,902 --> 00:27:44,497
Speaker 0: You could play it.

504
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:49,360
Speaker 0: It was way worse than pretty much any puzzle-y game that I had ever played.

505
00:27:49,642 --> 00:28:00,800
Speaker 1: What really amazed me, though, was that Smash Brothers clone, because it was just like a really, really bad, like it looked like Smash Brothers if it was like a high school development team's project to make it for a quarter.

506
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,640
Speaker 1: Like, it was just not.

507
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,540
Speaker 0: So let's talk about the ones that stood out and weren't just rehash garbage.

508
00:28:06,381 --> 00:28:06,946
Speaker 1: Uh, VA-11 Hall-A.

509
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:10,540
Speaker 0: In other words, Valhalla.

510
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,540
Speaker 1: Abandoned soberness, all ye who enter here.

511
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,520
Speaker 0: This game was amazing.

512
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:21,860
Speaker 0: So this game, I looked at it and I saw somewhat pixelated, really, really good anime art.

513
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,680
Speaker 0: I was already like, all right, you have my attention.

514
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,239
Speaker 0: I will see what your game is about.

515
00:28:25,881 --> 00:28:40,580
Speaker 0: Then I saw that it was like all cyberpunk styling, anime arts, and I'm like, anime characters in cyberpunk world, I'm already going to now read every line of text that you have written anywhere in your booth and talk to you peoples, right?

516
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,560
Speaker 0: Then I found out even more amazing, positive information.

517
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:49,100
Speaker 0: This game is a cyberpunk bartending simulator.

518
00:28:49,823 --> 00:28:50,699
Speaker 0: That is what it is.

519
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:55,240
Speaker 0: The way it works is very similar to another amazing game of our era.

520
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,380
Speaker 1: Papers, please.

521
00:28:57,005 --> 00:28:57,279
Speaker 0: Papers, please.

522
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:07,140
Speaker 0: Instead of checking passports for validity, people come up to you because you're a bartender and you produce for them beverages of various natures by combining ingredients.

523
00:29:07,301 --> 00:29:18,239
Speaker 0: Instead of a book telling you how to tell which passports are legit and not, there is a book of recipes and you have ingredients and you prepare the beverages and serve them to the people and they talk to you.

524
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:22,060
Speaker 0: So really what it is is a visual novel.

525
00:29:22,722 --> 00:29:28,630
Speaker 0: Instead of just directly choosing your own adventure by making choices, you produce alcoholic beverages.

526
00:29:28,972 --> 00:29:30,300
Speaker 0: that then guide the story.

527
00:29:30,641 --> 00:29:34,420
Speaker 1: There's this likely underage girl who shows up and she's like, "Yeah, make me a drink.

528
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:34,806
Speaker 1: I'm old

529
00:29:34,867 --> 00:29:35,071
Speaker 1: enough.".

530
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:39,916
Speaker 1: Then you look up the drink she ordered and the recipe is like a normal recipe.

531
00:29:41,201 --> 00:29:46,458
Speaker 1: and then there's an optional ingredient which is some drug and you're not really sure what that drug does.

532
00:29:47,361 --> 00:29:48,120
Speaker 0: You don't know anything.

533
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,599
Speaker 0: You learn by playing this over and over again.

534
00:29:50,082 --> 00:29:53,780
Speaker 1: Do you put that in her drink because she ordered it or because it's optional?

535
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,800
Speaker 1: Do you leave it out or do you not make it for her because you think she's an underage punk?

536
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,460
Speaker 1: But then she glitches out like she might be a hologram anyway.

537
00:30:02,143 --> 00:30:03,259
Speaker 0: It's cyberpunk world, right?

538
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,219
Speaker 1: It is the bar from Aitoru.

539
00:30:06,502 --> 00:30:07,442
Speaker 1: Like 100%.

540
00:30:07,442 --> 00:30:08,939
Speaker 1: It is basically that bar.

541
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,660
Speaker 0: I wonder if the giant Australian dude shows up.

542
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:12,400
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

543
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,239
Speaker 1: I hope the giant Australian dude shows up.

544
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,139
Speaker 1: He is my second favorite character in that book.

545
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,420
Speaker 0: First favorite?

546
00:30:18,561 --> 00:30:18,914
Speaker 0: I don't know.

547
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:19,938
Speaker 0: But yeah.

548
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,060
Speaker 0: So this game is amazing.

549
00:30:22,761 --> 00:30:23,976
Speaker 0: I can't wait for it to come out.

550
00:30:25,362 --> 00:30:27,300
Speaker 0: That's really all there is to say about it.

551
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:39,680
Speaker 0: It really also reminds me of a game we should talk about at some point that I played which is Long Live the Queen which is a visual novel where you guide the story not by making direct decisions.

552
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,120
Speaker 0: Well, sometimes you make direct decisions.

553
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:46,459
Speaker 0: But mostly you tell the queen what to learn.

554
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:47,979
Speaker 0: Like learn about cooking.

555
00:30:48,421 --> 00:30:49,008
Speaker 1: Hey, wait a minute.

556
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:50,120
Speaker 1: Someone's poisoning my food.

557
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:57,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, like today you should practice archery and you should practice learning history and then in your spare time you should play with your toys.

558
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:58,958
Speaker 0: And then based on her skills...

559
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,240
Speaker 1: It's a stat builder princess simulator.

560
00:31:00,481 --> 00:31:07,060
Speaker 0: Based on what skills she builds up by choosing these things it ends up automatically doing the choose your own adventure.

561
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:07,844
Speaker 0: You don't know.

562
00:31:08,085 --> 00:31:10,119
Speaker 0: on day five there's an archery test.

563
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:16,160
Speaker 0: So if you've practiced enough archery by day five the story goes this way and if you haven't the story goes another way.

564
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:16,777
Speaker 0: It's like that.

565
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,779
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've played it a little.

566
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:21,140
Speaker 1: We played a bunch of it actually at New Year's at one point.

567
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,518
Speaker 1: People were playing it in the other room.

568
00:31:23,902 --> 00:31:26,854
Speaker 1: The thing is the trailer for this game will sell you 100% on it alone.

569
00:31:30,242 --> 00:31:36,140
Speaker 0: I'm really liking this trend lately of choose your own adventure but with indirect choosing by some game mechanic.

570
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,059
Speaker 0: I guess that started way back in the Tokimeki days but now is even more polished.

571
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,073
Speaker 1: Yeah, well visual novels are a wide genre.

572
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,020
Speaker 1: I mean there's stat builders.

573
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,079
Speaker 1: There's like just choice trees.

574
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,379
Speaker 1: There's all these different kinds of games.

575
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,620
Speaker 0: But this kind, this is the best one of this kind that I've seen.

576
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,633
Speaker 0: I'm all about this.

577
00:31:53,694 --> 00:31:54,040
Speaker 0: Can't wait.

578
00:31:54,761 --> 00:31:56,960
Speaker 1: Oh wow, the tagline from the actual website.

579
00:31:57,081 --> 00:32:04,460
Speaker 1: Valhalla Cyberpunk Bartender Action is a booze-em-up about waifus, technology, and post-dystopia life.

580
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,497
Speaker 0: Yep, that's what it is.

581
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,618
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm so into this.

582
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,213
Speaker 1: So we played this board game.

583
00:32:08,233 --> 00:32:08,659
Speaker 1: Scott bought it.

584
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,900
Speaker 1: Well, it's a card game really.

585
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:15,180
Speaker 0: So it was on sale at the game salute booth and I had already played it earlier in the day with Matt.

586
00:32:15,641 --> 00:32:22,120
Speaker 0: So I had played the game and it was on sale and it was a really tiny two-player game and I just sold my copy of Jambo to someone else.

587
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,519
Speaker 1: Jambo was not that good.

588
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:29,060
Speaker 0: Apparently Jambo is a game that is out of print and was in demand and someone said that.

589
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,110
Speaker 0: And I said, "Hey, I have Jambo.

590
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:32,740
Speaker 0: I've bought it once, played it a few times, and haven't played it since.

591
00:32:32,841 --> 00:32:33,228
Speaker 0: Do you want

592
00:32:33,249 --> 00:32:33,330
Speaker 0: it?".

593
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:33,595
Speaker 0: They said,

594
00:32:33,656 --> 00:32:33,820
Speaker 0: "Yes.".

595
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,540
Speaker 0: So I mailed it to them in exchange for an Amazon gift certificate.

596
00:32:37,682 --> 00:32:40,080
Speaker 1: Marles the Mushroom, a Brent Povis production.

597
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, so this game pretty much fits the same role as Jambo.

598
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,860
Speaker 0: It comes in that sort of Lost Cities, Jambo-sized little tiny box.

599
00:32:47,521 --> 00:32:50,580
Speaker 0: It's 100% card-based and it's a two-player game.

600
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:56,339
Speaker 0: You can play pretty quickly, but it has a deep strategy to it or it's relatively deep, and it was on sale, so I picked it up.

601
00:32:56,743 --> 00:32:57,100
Speaker 0: It was alright.

602
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,940
Speaker 0: I played it twice at PAX East.

603
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,900
Speaker 1: I played it once, I played it with Scott, it was alright.

604
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,420
Speaker 1: I can see it has that small problem that games like this have.

605
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,460
Speaker 1: Like, what was that?

606
00:33:08,263 --> 00:33:18,020
Speaker 1: The games that are two-player, where in order to be a good game, you do have to know intuitively or count in your head how many of each card there are.

607
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,379
Speaker 1: You need to play the game a couple times.

608
00:33:19,781 --> 00:33:21,980
Speaker 0: It is a game about card counting a bit.

609
00:33:22,021 --> 00:33:22,773
Speaker 0: So the way it works...

610
00:33:23,241 --> 00:33:27,560
Speaker 1: But if both players' card counted, then it is a game of looking the other person in the eye.

611
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:32,678
Speaker 0: Yeah, so basically the way it works is there's mushrooms in a circle, and you're basically both...

612
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,039
Speaker 1: Twilight Struggle, that's the game I was thinking of.

613
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:38,720
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, both of the two players are walking around the circle, collecting mushrooms.

614
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,820
Speaker 0: You can only collect the mushrooms at your feet easily, right?

615
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:43,158
Speaker 0: Which are the ones that are next.

616
00:33:44,161 --> 00:33:46,878
Speaker 0: And there are mushrooms farther away, but you need a stick to get to them.

617
00:33:48,143 --> 00:33:51,000
Speaker 0: So when you collect mushrooms, they go in your hand, but you can only hold so many.

618
00:33:51,101 --> 00:33:52,699
Speaker 0: If you get baskets, you can hold a few more.

619
00:33:53,502 --> 00:33:57,599
Speaker 0: And if you collect enough mushrooms of the same kind, you can sell them or cook them.

620
00:33:57,961 --> 00:34:01,640
Speaker 0: If you sell them, you can get sticks, which help you get better mushrooms.

621
00:34:02,422 --> 00:34:04,899
Speaker 0: If you cook them in a pan, you get victory points.

622
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,698
Speaker 1: Sticks are more important than you think.

623
00:34:08,161 --> 00:34:09,060
Speaker 0: Sticks are way important.

624
00:34:09,501 --> 00:34:15,639
Speaker 0: So the thing is, for example, the morel, the most valuable mushroom, there's only three morel cards in the game.

625
00:34:16,021 --> 00:34:19,280
Speaker 0: You need at least three of any particular mushroom card to cook it.

626
00:34:19,521 --> 00:34:22,077
Speaker 0: If you collect all three morels and cook them, you get, like, 16 points.

627
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,478
Speaker 0: It's a ridiculous number of points.

628
00:34:24,022 --> 00:34:25,600
Speaker 1: But at the same time, if you have...

629
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:30,600
Speaker 0: If you pick up two morels, the other guy just snipes the third one, then you just wasted your time picking up two morels.

630
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:36,080
Speaker 1: Well, no, because at the same time, you can take two or more of a type and convert it into sticks.

631
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,179
Speaker 0: Yes, if you take...

632
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:41,040
Speaker 1: But if you have just one morel, you're kind of fucked with that thing.

633
00:34:41,481 --> 00:34:44,280
Speaker 0: Well, unless you just took it near the end to prevent the other guy from getting the third.

634
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if you take it early...

635
00:34:46,121 --> 00:34:47,088
Speaker 0: Yeah, right?

636
00:34:47,149 --> 00:34:48,540
Speaker 0: It clogs up your hand the whole game.

637
00:34:48,643 --> 00:34:48,877
Speaker 0: Yeah.

638
00:34:49,722 --> 00:34:55,540
Speaker 0: And there's some other stuff going on, like moon cards to get better fancy night mushrooms and other crazy stuff.

639
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,440
Speaker 1: It's a little hard to teach because they have two different ways of, like, laying out the board.

640
00:34:59,841 --> 00:35:08,400
Speaker 1: Everyone who watched me and Scott play didn't understand how the, like, rotting movement was actually happening.

641
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:19,760
Speaker 0: The original rules say to put the mushrooms in a line, which conceptually makes the most sense because, you know, all the mushrooms are marching towards the decay pile in a straight line.

642
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:26,560
Speaker 0: It makes sense, but if you play that way, physically it's very demanding because you have to keep sliding the mushrooms over.

643
00:35:26,842 --> 00:35:31,740
Speaker 0: Or, if you're playing at a table that's long enough, keep moving your chair to the side as the mushroom train moves, right?

644
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:46,100
Speaker 0: So, putting the mushrooms in a circle and using one of the spare sticks as a token indicating which part of the circle is the front and moving it around clockwise is much easier because now you have to move this one token, you have to move cards around.

645
00:35:47,001 --> 00:35:51,500
Speaker 0: So, the circle way is better, but it's harder to understand if you've never played it before.

646
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:58,820
Speaker 1: So, actually, I think the best way, having played it now, is that I feel like you should teach with the line, and once someone gets it, just play with the circle.

647
00:35:59,723 --> 00:36:02,060
Speaker 1: Because once you get the line, the circle makes perfect sense.

648
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:02,442
Speaker 1: Yep.

649
00:36:03,076 --> 00:36:03,260
Speaker 0: Anyway.

650
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,679
Speaker 1: But it was a pretty fun game.

651
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:13,780
Speaker 0: If you're looking for a two-player game that comes in a single box that is cheap and doesn't take long to play, that has some good replay value to it, get Smash Brothers.

652
00:36:14,802 --> 00:36:17,080
Speaker 0: Get Lost Cities, because that's the greatest of all time.

653
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:17,449
Speaker 1: Yep.

654
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,420
Speaker 0: If you don't want to get that, you should probably just get Netrunner.

655
00:36:22,063 --> 00:36:22,168
Speaker 1: Yep.

656
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:27,060
Speaker 0: And then maybe get Morels, or maybe Battle Line, right?

657
00:36:27,282 --> 00:36:28,260
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, Battle Line.

658
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,059
Speaker 0: This is about as good as Battle Line, I'd say.

659
00:36:30,424 --> 00:36:30,832
Speaker 1: Yeah, it might.

660
00:36:30,914 --> 00:36:31,200
Speaker 1: I can't.

661
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,699
Speaker 0: Notice two of those games are made by Rain or Kinesia, both Battle Line and Lost Cities.

662
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:39,620
Speaker 1: I suspect that Battle Line, in the end, is better than this game, but...

663
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,460
Speaker 0: Battle Line is probably slightly better than this game.

664
00:36:41,823 --> 00:36:42,550
Speaker 1: You're right, slightly.

665
00:36:42,571 --> 00:36:43,540
Speaker 1: I don't think by much.

666
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,551
Speaker 0: But Battle Line requires a bigger setup.

667
00:36:45,611 --> 00:36:46,134
Speaker 0: It's a bigger game.

668
00:36:47,463 --> 00:36:49,020
Speaker 0: This is tighter, physically speaking.

669
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,477
Speaker 1: It plays a lot quicker, too.

670
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:55,240
Speaker 0: So, again, if you need another two-player game, Morels is not a bad choice.

671
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,257
Speaker 0: It's not like some great, "Oh, my God, Lost Cities is the greatest

672
00:36:58,277 --> 00:36:58,559
Speaker 0: game."

673
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:02,980
Speaker 0: But worthy of paying money for, especially on sale.

674
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:07,640
Speaker 1: So, guys, we've talked about it many times, but I cannot stress this enough.

675
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,860
Speaker 1: Video Ball... Video Ball!

676
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,820
Speaker 1: ...is the fucking, like, this is going to be the breakout game.

677
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,480
Speaker 1: I cannot stress this enough.

678
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,400
Speaker 0: Even if no one else Video Balls, we are going to Video Ball.

679
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:25,340
Speaker 1: In fact, we're hereby announcing that Scott and I have officially, as of today, formed the second professional Video Ball team.

680
00:37:26,084 --> 00:37:29,580
Speaker 0: There might be others, but someone has already formed the first.

681
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:33,980
Speaker 0: I don't know how many there are, but we have also formed a pro Video Ball team.

682
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:39,500
Speaker 0: We are going to play Video Ball seriously, as a team, practicing and everything.

683
00:37:39,681 --> 00:37:44,840
Speaker 1: The old gentleman with long hair and the old gentleman who is bald, a pair to be too old to play Video Ball.

684
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,150
Speaker 1: The young men are routing circles around them.

685
00:37:47,191 --> 00:37:48,035
Speaker 1: It is a travesty.

686
00:37:48,075 --> 00:37:48,860
Speaker 1: It is a disaster.

687
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,403
Speaker 0: But we will still be there.

688
00:37:50,423 --> 00:37:57,500
Speaker 0: We will have, you know, awesome, like, you know, if we can't be actually good at winning, we're going to be serviceably good.

689
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:01,140
Speaker 1: We're going to be good at trash talk and making a ruckus is what we're going to be doing.

690
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:05,120
Speaker 0: We're going to have plenty of style and showmanship in our Video Balling, even if we do not win.

691
00:38:06,122 --> 00:38:07,900
Speaker 1: My game name might be Jake the Snake.

692
00:38:08,081 --> 00:38:10,029
Speaker 0: And maybe we'll win.

693
00:38:11,616 --> 00:38:12,560
Speaker 0: Wouldn't that be the shit?

694
00:38:13,361 --> 00:38:18,400
Speaker 1: I'm feeling Video Ball because there's been a big rise in the last few years.

695
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:22,560
Speaker 0: We just have to avoid the typical problem with rim and cob games of killing your friend.

696
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:30,460
Speaker 1: You mean the typical problem of we're doing fine and rivers at your ransom and Scott just keeps walking in front of me when I'm swinging a lead piper around.

697
00:38:31,484 --> 00:38:33,774
Speaker 0: Oh, you walked into my constantly punching fist.

698
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,320
Speaker 0: That's like what a three-year-old's doing.

699
00:38:36,621 --> 00:38:40,440
Speaker 1: I point out that when you and Adam played, you had similar troubles.

700
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,780
Speaker 1: When me and Adam played, no trouble.

701
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,220
Speaker 0: Video Ball is going to replace Mario Tennis.

702
00:38:47,523 --> 00:38:49,239
Speaker 1: Mario Tennis is already dead.

703
00:38:50,622 --> 00:38:53,780
Speaker 0: It's replacing the space formerly occupied by Mario Tennis.

704
00:38:54,361 --> 00:38:55,263
Speaker 1: And you know what?

705
00:38:55,564 --> 00:39:03,000
Speaker 1: We were saying that for a while, but now that we have spoken at length with some of the team behind Video Ball, they know their shit.

706
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,949
Speaker 0: Video Ball developers know what they're doing.

707
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:09,480
Speaker 0: They know as much about games as we do, perhaps even more.

708
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,001
Speaker 1: You know what?

709
00:39:10,301 --> 00:39:19,376
Speaker 1: They know as much about games broadly as we do, except in the narrow area of two-player direct competition video games.

710
00:39:19,416 --> 00:39:22,200
Speaker 1: that are simple, they have untold depth.

711
00:39:22,521 --> 00:39:28,240
Speaker 0: Usually when I go talk to someone at a PAX booth, a game developer or whatever, I'm picking apart the things that they are saying.

712
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,720
Speaker 0: When I went to hear what the Video Ball guy had to say, I learned.

713
00:39:32,101 --> 00:39:34,315
Speaker 1: Oh my god, when he called us a secret?

714
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:44,120
Speaker 0: We were schooled by, I mean not that we were schooled like we were burned or anything, but we went to his school and reverently studied his ways.

715
00:39:44,461 --> 00:39:53,400
Speaker 1: I now know a magic number that I won't share with you because it's his duty if he wants to share it or not, but there's a timing between when one thing happens in this game and another thing.

716
00:39:53,820 --> 00:40:02,518
Speaker 1: And that timing is down to the sub-millisecond, the same timing as something that happens in another game, and that is a magic number.

717
00:40:02,618 --> 00:40:03,680
Speaker 0: for how long you should wait.

718
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:10,040
Speaker 0: The fact that he would even say that that is a thing that is in the game proves to me how much they know what they're doing.

719
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:23,240
Speaker 0: They've even gone so far, for example, as to purposefully leave space around the playfield so that you can livestream Video Ball and still put your shit up on the screen in those spaces.

720
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,080
Speaker 0: That is how far that they have thought about the design of this game.

721
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,118
Speaker 1: When we asked them, "Hey, so when we have a professional team, where can we put our

722
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:32,500
Speaker 1: logo?".

723
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,468
Speaker 1: And he was like, "Actually, you put it right there.

724
00:40:34,991 --> 00:40:36,919
Speaker 1: That's the place for the logos of the

725
00:40:36,939 --> 00:40:37,160
Speaker 1: teams.".

726
00:40:37,763 --> 00:40:39,534
Speaker 1: It was, oh, this game.

727
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,359
Speaker 0: Video Ball!

728
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:47,360
Speaker 1: It would be the best Pax Omegathon, it would be the best hanging out, it replaces Nidhogg as well.

729
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:52,776
Speaker 1: Nidhogg could have been this, except Nidhogg development stopped and the game is 100% dead.

730
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,600
Speaker 1: This will go where Nidhogg failed to go.

731
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,099
Speaker 0: We're gonna make it happen no matter what.

732
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:58,741
Speaker 1: You know what?

733
00:40:58,922 --> 00:41:03,999
Speaker 1: If you all don't get on the Video Ball train with us, I'm riding it away into the sunset by myself.

734
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,132
Speaker 0: Even despite us entering into the pro...

735
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,380
Speaker 1: Scott, Video Ball NYC, we're forming the New York City Video Ball League.

736
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,363
Speaker 0: Sure, let's do it.

737
00:41:11,865 --> 00:41:15,680
Speaker 0: We should also have, since you're playing it online, we should have the FRC ladder.

738
00:41:16,441 --> 00:41:17,105
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

739
00:41:17,125 --> 00:41:19,359
Speaker 0: Is there a website that will just maintain ladders for you?

740
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,420
Speaker 0: The same way that Penny Arcade has a ping pong ladder.

741
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,499
Speaker 1: Is there a website that just maintains ladders for you?

742
00:41:24,061 --> 00:41:26,340
Speaker 0: I don't know if Challenge supports it.

743
00:41:26,581 --> 00:41:27,306
Speaker 1: I'll look into this.

744
00:41:27,326 --> 00:41:29,360
Speaker 1: I don't want to make one, really.

745
00:41:29,668 --> 00:41:29,980
Speaker 0: Me either.

746
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:32,440
Speaker 1: Anyway.

747
00:41:33,181 --> 00:41:34,119
Speaker 1: Oh my god, Video Ball.

748
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,820
Speaker 1: Wait until this fucking game comes out.

749
00:41:38,223 --> 00:41:40,019
Speaker 1: Much like when My Little Pony came out.

750
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,120
Speaker 1: Once Video Ball is out, we're gonna be insufferable and talk about nothing but Video Ball.

751
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,320
Speaker 1: For, like, months.

752
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,120
Speaker 1: Also, New Ponies is coming out in, like, a month.

753
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:50,678
Speaker 0: I didn't know that.

754
00:41:51,101 --> 00:41:53,140
Speaker 0: Oh, Gravity Falls has gone off the chain.

755
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,520
Speaker 1: So has Steven Universe, Scott.

756
00:41:56,564 --> 00:41:58,060
Speaker 0: I only watched a few Steven Universes.

757
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:58,939
Speaker 1: Yeah, Steven Universe.

758
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,860
Speaker 0: Like the one with the broken teleporters.

759
00:42:00,961 --> 00:42:01,705
Speaker 0: Steven Universe.

760
00:42:01,765 --> 00:42:04,520
Speaker 1: I'm gonna say the names of three properties now.

761
00:42:04,942 --> 00:42:08,080
Speaker 1: And you're gonna wonder how the fuck I'm relating these to Steven Universe.

762
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,140
Speaker 1: Uh, Utena, which you can kinda get.

763
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:10,979
Speaker 0: Yeah, I already saw that part.

764
00:42:11,482 --> 00:42:11,838
Speaker 1: Evangelion.

765
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:12,300
Speaker 1: Didn't see.

766
00:42:12,381 --> 00:42:13,860
Speaker 1: And the Culture series.

767
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:14,759
Speaker 0: Saw the Culture part.

768
00:42:15,262 --> 00:42:15,831
Speaker 1: Uh, no you didn't.

769
00:42:15,851 --> 00:42:16,379
Speaker 1: You think you did.

770
00:42:16,865 --> 00:42:17,140
Speaker 0: Okay.

771
00:42:18,644 --> 00:42:22,275
Speaker 1: So, yeah, we're... Adventure Time has been, like, a game.

772
00:42:22,437 --> 00:42:22,940
Speaker 1: Ace Forever.

773
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,680
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah, Gravity Falls and Steven Universe.

774
00:42:26,341 --> 00:42:27,214
Speaker 1: There's talk.

775
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:34,160
Speaker 1: If we... Guys, if you gave us enough money to quit our jobs and do Geek Nights full-time, there would be Geek Nights Presents Gravity Falls.

776
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,959
Speaker 1: There would be Geek Nights Presents Video Ball.

777
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,559
Speaker 0: Send monies to me.

778
00:42:38,701 --> 00:42:40,310
Speaker 0: We would need $210,000 a month.

779
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:45,380
Speaker 1: And we would do Geek Nights for you full-time.

780
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,179
Speaker 1: Okay.

781
00:42:46,521 --> 00:42:47,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

782
00:42:48,842 --> 00:42:52,020
Speaker 0: Even a rich dude who's got a million dollars would be broke in five months.

783
00:42:52,661 --> 00:42:53,519
Speaker 1: You know what's funny, though?

784
00:42:53,842 --> 00:42:55,680
Speaker 1: You know, I was in London at this finance conference.

785
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,190
Speaker 0: Wait, don't you mean $210,000 a year?

786
00:42:59,029 --> 00:42:59,238
Speaker 1: Yes.

787
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, so he'd be broke in five years, the rich guy.

788
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:02,735
Speaker 1: Yeah, so...

789
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's fine.

790
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:07,480
Speaker 1: So, you know, you say that first number first, just in case.

791
00:43:07,687 --> 00:43:08,000
Speaker 0: Right.

792
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:13,980
Speaker 1: But, uh, I met people when I was traveling at these conventions who make easily double what I make.

793
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:20,537
Speaker 1: And, uh, more than one of them asked me privately, multiple times, "How can they get into video

794
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:20,760
Speaker 1: games?".

795
00:43:21,163 --> 00:43:23,820
Speaker 1: They would do almost anything to work in the video games industry.

796
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:26,260
Speaker 0: How much money do you have to throw around, double rich guy?

797
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,545
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was like, "Really?

798
00:43:27,585 --> 00:43:28,309
Speaker 1: Buy your way in?

799
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,600
Speaker 1: Or be a brilliant game designer?

800
00:43:31,301 --> 00:43:34,356
Speaker 1: Or make half the money and work three times the

801
00:43:34,396 --> 00:43:34,758
Speaker 1: hours?".

802
00:43:35,227 --> 00:43:35,357
Speaker 0: Yep.

803
00:43:36,383 --> 00:43:37,320
Speaker 1: Oh my god, video ball.

804
00:43:37,961 --> 00:43:38,806
Speaker 0: Give me the money.

805
00:43:39,007 --> 00:43:41,160
Speaker 0: I will be the brilliant game designer.

806
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:42,498
Speaker 1: Two more little games.

807
00:43:43,005 --> 00:43:43,920
Speaker 1: One more line.

808
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:44,768
Speaker 1: One more line.

809
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:45,820
Speaker 1: I'm already done with it.

810
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,398
Speaker 1: It's actually not that great as I played it.

811
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:48,756
Speaker 0: So, okay, so...

812
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:49,880
Speaker 1: It looks really good, though.

813
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,800
Speaker 0: The game is really, it's like, it's good.

814
00:43:53,300 --> 00:44:02,840
Speaker 0: The problem is, is that unlike, say, Super Hexagon, you play Super Hexagon, and at first you start at Hexagon and it's balls hard, but eventually you get it, right?

815
00:44:03,103 --> 00:44:03,880
Speaker 1: And then you're playing like...

816
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,099
Speaker 0: Then you're playing Hexagonist.

817
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:06,660
Speaker 0: And then you're playing, right?

818
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:10,080
Speaker 0: You know, you have this buildup of difficulty and speed.

819
00:44:10,961 --> 00:44:19,451
Speaker 0: This game is just the same game every time, and even though your skills build up at the game and you get better at it, I never seem to get past, like, 120, 150 area.

820
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:36,820
Speaker 0: Like, I keep either dying early from bullshit, or, and I've practiced and I've gotten good at it, and it's like, yep, I'm in the groove, I know what's going on, and then just like, you know, you hit a ball and crash that was off-screen that you couldn't have avoided, and that's the limit.

821
00:44:37,001 --> 00:44:58,580
Speaker 1: Even if they fix that, the problem with games like this, I think, is that any game where you're measuring, like, how far you get, if it doesn't have an ending because you won, maybe some score that shows your mastery along the way, or the difficulty literally does continue to escalate forever, so there is always a point where you're just not skilled enough.

822
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:03,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's no changing in difficulty that I can really tell, other than the balls get big, the balls get, you know, things like that.

823
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:03,886
Speaker 0: Yep.

824
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,600
Speaker 0: It's just, you, it's just how long can you go?

825
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:09,079
Speaker 0: It's just straight endurance doing the same exact thing.

826
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:18,919
Speaker 1: This is why, while I respect in one sense, like, someone who has, like, the World Championship score in Asteroids or games like that, I also kind of don't, because games like that, once you get to a certain level of goodness...

827
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:21,660
Speaker 0: They don't get faster, they don't get harder, it's just how long can you do it?

828
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,860
Speaker 1: It's not even how long can you in some cases, how long are you willing to?

829
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,638
Speaker 1: I mean, Digdog, like...

830
00:45:29,062 --> 00:45:29,780
Speaker 0: I'd love me some Digdog.

831
00:45:29,881 --> 00:45:30,338
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

832
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:48,620
Speaker 0: So yeah, this game, I think what they should have done is they should have made it, you know, like, one of those ones where, you know, you get a little bit farther and it turns into clouds, and then you're in space, and that, you know, and that kind of thing, and also, like, earning, you know, it's a crappy game model, but it kind of works, where you get upgrades, and then the game changes as you go.

833
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:53,640
Speaker 1: It's basically, it's one of those games, like, really, again, it kind of worries and bothers me that so many people...

834
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,139
Speaker 0: But the music is so fucking pumping.

835
00:45:55,500 --> 00:46:01,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, but so many people have games like this at PAX, like, just, this is a game you'll play for 20 minutes on your phone.

836
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,018
Speaker 0: This is the best of them.

837
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,659
Speaker 1: Yes, this is the best of them.

838
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,940
Speaker 0: And I still, I play it a little bit, like, if I just need to touch something.

839
00:46:07,801 --> 00:46:11,568
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'll just go back to Nourishima Hexarch Super Hexagon, like, I don't... Yeah.

840
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,240
Speaker 1: And actually, you know what I started doing?

841
00:46:13,422 --> 00:46:14,140
Speaker 0: It's not Super Hexagon.

842
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,620
Speaker 1: Carrying my old DS around again.

843
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:17,138
Speaker 0: To play?

844
00:46:17,402 --> 00:46:18,380
Speaker 1: To play Advance Wars.

845
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:26,860
Speaker 1: 'Cause that's still... So, the last game that's new that we can play, a little quick game, we played Red 7.

846
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:30,860
Speaker 0: Red 7 is a lot like Flux-ish, where you sort of...

847
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,340
Speaker 1: It's Flux, but not stupid.

848
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:36,479
Speaker 0: Right, so it's a card game where you change the rules of the game as you play it.

849
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:40,340
Speaker 0: Here is the one thing about the game I can tell you that's amazing.

850
00:46:40,722 --> 00:46:47,080
Speaker 0: On your turn, you can either, A, change the rule, B, change the cards that you have.

851
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:50,940
Speaker 0: So, obviously, the cards that you have are the ones that are affected by the rule.

852
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,279
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're making like a poker hand.

853
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,980
Speaker 0: So, there'll be a rule that says, like, whoever has the highest card wins.

854
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:59,400
Speaker 0: So, the cards you have are what is judged by that rule, right?

855
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,760
Speaker 1: So, maybe I play a 7 and now I'm winning.

856
00:47:02,061 --> 00:47:06,060
Speaker 1: Or maybe I change the rule to, like, whoever has the most even cards wins.

857
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:12,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you can change the rule, you can add to your cards, thus changing, you know, how the rule affects you, or you can do both.

858
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,139
Speaker 0: And it's very hard to draw more cards.

859
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:21,440
Speaker 0: At the end of your turn, after changing the rule, changing your cards, or both, you need to be winning.

860
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:25,360
Speaker 0: As in, you are the number one first place sole possessor of winning.

861
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:32,020
Speaker 0: If you are not the sole possessor of first place, according to the judgment rule, at the end of your turn, then you have lost.

862
00:47:32,561 --> 00:47:33,079
Speaker 1: You're done.

863
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:41,019
Speaker 0: If you have no way to make yourself the winner on your turn, you are completely eliminated from the game, the end, and the remaining players continue to use cards in their hand to win.

864
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,211
Speaker 1: That's pretty much it.

865
00:47:42,454 --> 00:47:42,698
Speaker 1: I mean...

866
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,337
Speaker 0: That's the whole game, and that is amazing.

867
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,520
Speaker 1: There was an advanced mode we didn't know about and didn't play.

868
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:52,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're gonna have to play this a lot more, and once we get that advanced mode going, we'll probably be able to do a whole episode on this.

869
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,500
Speaker 0: But that mechanic in this game is genius.

870
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:01,399
Speaker 0: I'm sure you can make at least one or two more games with that mechanic without having to be played out.

871
00:48:02,381 --> 00:48:03,853
Speaker 1: It is, it's pretty fun.

872
00:48:03,994 --> 00:48:04,780
Speaker 1: It's not that great.

873
00:48:04,921 --> 00:48:06,660
Speaker 1: It'll get played out, I think, pretty quickly.

874
00:48:06,901 --> 00:48:09,220
Speaker 0: This isn't some thing that you can keep playing like Wizard.

875
00:48:09,841 --> 00:48:10,599
Speaker 1: You know what it's like?

876
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,140
Speaker 1: You know where the place it serves in your game library?

877
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,629
Speaker 1: Right next to No Thanks.

878
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:16,020
Speaker 1: It's a quick game you play.

879
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:18,040
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, this is definitely in the No Thanks territory.

880
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:21,100
Speaker 1: Yes, you bust it out while you're waiting for your food at a restaurant.

881
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:26,400
Speaker 0: Because it plays so quickly, because you get eliminated, and your starting hand is so small, and drawing cards is so difficult.

882
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:30,880
Speaker 0: If you do manage to draw a card, and I'm not gonna get into how you do that, that helps you a whole lot.

883
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,636
Speaker 0: That can make you survive a whole 'nother?

884
00:48:32,696 --> 00:48:32,999
Speaker 0: turn.

885
00:48:33,382 --> 00:48:41,580
Speaker 0: Because that card you draw is gonna give you a way to be winning on your turn, and then everyone else has to do it one more time before it gets back to you.

886
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:45,300
Speaker 1: It's also a Karl Chudick, so you can see why it's already at this pretty good level.

887
00:48:45,801 --> 00:48:48,018
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the Glory to Rome guy, right?

888
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:50,400
Speaker 1: There's another designer here.

889
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:51,239
Speaker 0: Is it the Glory to Rome guy?

890
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:51,662
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.

891
00:48:52,004 --> 00:48:55,140
Speaker 1: But there's another guy, Chris Sizlik, who I don't know who that is, actually.

892
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:56,899
Speaker 1: Co-credited as designer.

893
00:48:57,661 --> 00:49:01,200
Speaker 1: And I don't recognize any of the other games this person has done.

894
00:49:01,592 --> 00:49:01,799
Speaker 1: Okay.

895
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,018
Speaker 1: Adorable Pandering.

896
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:03,900
Speaker 0: I like that.

897
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:06,080
Speaker 1: It looks like an expansion to Innovation.

898
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,200
Speaker 0: Innovation's also the same guy.

899
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,288
Speaker 1: Rolling Ramparts?

900
00:49:10,308 --> 00:49:11,619
Speaker 1: That sounds like a good name, but...

901
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,040
Speaker 0: Why don't we make Rampart the board game?

902
00:49:15,022 --> 00:49:16,539
Speaker 1: This doesn't necessarily look good.

903
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,360
Speaker 0: No, I mean, why don't we make Rampart, real Rampart, the board game?

904
00:49:21,422 --> 00:49:22,458
Speaker 1: You know what should've been that?

905
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:23,315
Speaker 1: Castellan.

906
00:49:26,503 --> 00:49:35,820
Speaker 1: So yeah, we played a ton of games at PAX East, even though the games we played with our friends were mostly Netrunner, Hans and Teutonica, Wizard.

907
00:49:36,389 --> 00:49:36,598
Speaker 0: Wizard.

908
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:41,440
Speaker 0: I played two Hans and Teutonica, two Wizards, two or three Netrunners.

909
00:49:42,462 --> 00:49:43,439
Speaker 0: There was a lot going on there.

910
00:49:44,045 --> 00:49:45,139
Speaker 0: I played some video balls.

911
00:49:45,601 --> 00:49:47,580
Speaker 1: Oh my god, I just wanted to go play a video ball.

912
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,651
Speaker 1: We gotta get those guys.

913
00:49:49,671 --> 00:49:51,059
Speaker 1: You know where video ball just needs to be?

914
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:51,633
Speaker 1: Everywhere.

915
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,160
Speaker 1: You know that couch at Magfest?

916
00:49:54,363 --> 00:49:56,420
Speaker 1: It's just gotta be there 24/7.

917
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:56,507
Speaker 0: Yeah.

918
00:49:57,303 --> 00:49:57,938
Speaker 1: Oh my gosh.

919
00:49:58,483 --> 00:50:12,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, we talked to these guys at length, and we'll have some video as soon as I... I have like a month-long backlog of video to edit for you guys, and I apologize for that, but I'm gonna put to the top of the queue the discussion we had with some of the video ball people at PAX.

920
00:50:13,423 --> 00:50:15,560
Speaker 1: Because that was... You're getting some schooling.

921
00:50:21,361 --> 00:50:23,480
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

922
