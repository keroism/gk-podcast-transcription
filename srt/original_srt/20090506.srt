1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,224
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, May 6th.

2
00:00:11,505 --> 00:00:11,947
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,007 --> 00:00:12,488
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,568 --> 00:00:13,732
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:13,772 --> 00:00:16,400
Speaker 0: Tonight, we review Naoki Urasawa's Monster.

6
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:26,928
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:31,421 --> 00:00:40,240
Speaker 0: So, I think we've mentioned it a couple times, but we haven't actually done a big deal about it, but just in case, we're gonna be at Anime Boston for the first time ever this year.

8
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,208
Speaker 1: Oh my gosh, Boston.

9
00:00:42,932 --> 00:00:48,954
Speaker 1: We got all these people we know in Boston, but it's like, we've never gone to see them because we never go to Boston.

10
00:00:48,974 --> 00:00:50,640
Speaker 0: I know, I've never even been to Boston.

11
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:59,465
Speaker 1: I've been to Boston like a hundred times, you know, in the first 18 years of my life, and zero times in the past nine years of my life.

12
00:00:59,686 --> 00:01:04,080
Speaker 0: This is gonna be interesting though, because one, it's a new anime con, and even if you're jaded...

13
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,168
Speaker 1: Well, it's not new, but it's new to us.

14
00:01:05,328 --> 00:01:12,740
Speaker 0: It's new to us, but going to a con you've never been to before, even if you've been to a million anime cons and you're jaded, there's something about the new con.

15
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:22,460
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, yeah, it's like there's a lot of, you know, stuff that you haven't seen before, you know, hopefully, and at the very least you're learning a new building, you know, learn new restaurants.

16
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:24,266
Speaker 0: Yeah, hang out in Boston.

17
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,320
Speaker 1: Plus friends that we don't see too often.

18
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, and we're doing a whole bunch of panels at Anime Boston.

19
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:31,649
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,924
Speaker 0: Now, if you've seen us at all of the other cons that we go to, we're doing a lot of the same name panels, but we've upped the ante.

21
00:01:38,285 --> 00:01:43,640
Speaker 0: So, if you think you saw Anime You Should See, you should probably see Anime You Should See at Anime Boston.

22
00:01:44,121 --> 00:01:44,350
Speaker 0: Uh-oh.

23
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:46,285
Speaker 0: We've upped it.

24
00:01:46,386 --> 00:01:47,374
Speaker 0: We've put it over 9,000 or so.

25
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:48,718
Speaker 1: Oh, shit.

26
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,440
Speaker 0: And out of the blue, we're also going to do Beyond Dungeons and Dragons again.

27
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:54,351
Speaker 1: Okay.

28
00:01:55,723 --> 00:01:59,520
Speaker 1: See, I don't mind doing a repeat panel, as long as it's not a repeat at the same convention.

29
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,668
Speaker 0: Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing.

30
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:04,480
Speaker 0: What if it's a con that's so big and the room just wasn't big enough?

31
00:02:04,801 --> 00:02:07,880
Speaker 1: I have to have, like, some sort of guarantee that there's no one seeing it twice.

32
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:10,758
Speaker 1: Especially if someone who hasn't seen it wants to see it.

33
00:02:11,081 --> 00:02:13,900
Speaker 0: Well, maybe we'll have to do something like that for PAX.

34
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,560
Speaker 0: At the beginning, if anyone is in the room who's already seen the panel, we'll kick them out.

35
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,738
Speaker 0: I think that's the only way to go about it.

36
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:30,840
Speaker 0: Of course, we might have a bigger room for that, but Anime Boston, Memorial Day weekend, May 22nd to 24th at the Heinz Convention Center and Sheraton Boston Hotel in Boston?

37
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,179
Speaker 0: Anime Boston?

38
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,120
Speaker 1: Boston, Massachusetts.

39
00:02:34,582 --> 00:02:34,756
Speaker 1: Yeah.

40
00:02:34,984 --> 00:02:35,177
Speaker 0: Yeah.

41
00:02:35,462 --> 00:02:36,679
Speaker 0: I don't think there are many other Bostons.

42
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:40,960
Speaker 0: If you end up at another Boston, I'm sorry, but we're not going to do a panel there.

43
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:41,659
Speaker 1: Yeah, sorry.

44
00:02:42,723 --> 00:02:43,389
Speaker 0: I think it'll be fun.

45
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:44,600
Speaker 0: We're not doing that many panels.

46
00:02:44,821 --> 00:02:50,219
Speaker 0: We're doing enough to where we'll, you know, have a presence at the con and all that stuff, but we'll actually be able to hang out.

47
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:56,993
Speaker 0: So, if you tried to talk to us at Otacon and we blew you off and disappeared, we can actually talk to you at Anime Boston.

48
00:02:57,013 --> 00:02:58,099
Speaker 0: This will be a big change for us.

49
00:02:59,944 --> 00:03:00,305
Speaker 1: All right.

50
00:03:00,385 --> 00:03:06,840
Speaker 1: So, if people did not know, last Saturday was Free Comic Book Day.

51
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:12,059
Speaker 1: And for every year of Geek Nights, we've always done a Free Comic Book Day episode, every time.

52
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,880
Speaker 1: I don't know if we're going to do one this year.

53
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,840
Speaker 1: Let me, let me do, this will be your replacement for a Free Comic Book Day episode.

54
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:24,020
Speaker 1: First of all, right, a lot of the comics on Free Comic Book Day are more of the same.

55
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:33,200
Speaker 1: For example, every year there is a free Bongo Comics for All, that is basically the Simpsons, Futurama, Matt Groening property comic, right?

56
00:03:33,742 --> 00:03:36,576
Speaker 1: And it's the same quality stuff every year.

57
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:37,340
Speaker 1: It's no different.

58
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,680
Speaker 1: And it's sort of, you know, there are very few, I mean, there's an Atomic Robo comic this year.

59
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,106
Speaker 1: There was one last year.

60
00:03:43,127 --> 00:03:44,433
Speaker 1: There's an Owly this year.

61
00:03:44,674 --> 00:03:45,980
Speaker 1: There was an Owly last year.

62
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:53,800
Speaker 1: And there's so few that are new from year to year that there's not much use in, you know, going over them again.

63
00:03:53,961 --> 00:03:55,571
Speaker 0: So what about the new ones?

64
00:03:55,671 --> 00:03:57,060
Speaker 0: I'm sure they're all amazing.

65
00:03:57,361 --> 00:03:59,860
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is, right, I went down to the Dragon's Den.

66
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:11,560
Speaker 1: And the Dragon's Den, you know, for what problems the store may have, is awesome on Free Comic Book Day, because they allow you to take one of each, and they usually get some of each.

67
00:04:11,902 --> 00:04:14,659
Speaker 0: I feel, though, like every good comic shop will let you do that.

68
00:04:15,181 --> 00:04:18,418
Speaker 1: No, the vast majority of comic shops are like, take, pick two.

69
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, and hence, I said, every good comic shop.

70
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,760
Speaker 1: Right, so the Dragon's Den lets you take one of each, which is why I always go there, so I can get one of each.

71
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:32,640
Speaker 1: And that's the only reason we're able to do these Free Comic Book Day episodes that cover all these comics, because I can go and get one of each for us.

72
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,140
Speaker 1: Now, I did go there, and I did get one of each and got a bunch.

73
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,558
Speaker 0: Well, I actually haven't been to the Dragon's Den in like...

74
00:04:38,963 --> 00:04:39,900
Speaker 1: There's no reason to go there.

75
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,500
Speaker 0: Almost a year.

76
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,357
Speaker 1: There's nothing there for you.

77
00:04:42,721 --> 00:04:47,980
Speaker 1: Now, what was awesome is I sort of always feel bad going in there every year and getting all these comics and not buying anything.

78
00:04:48,482 --> 00:04:52,074
Speaker 1: But they had a huge sale simultaneously on comics.

79
00:04:52,114 --> 00:04:52,596
Speaker 1: It was 40% off, everything.

80
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:54,421
Speaker 0: Really?

81
00:04:54,441 --> 00:04:55,527
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what this means to me?

82
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,840
Speaker 0: The cynic reading into this is that...

83
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,879
Speaker 1: They're getting rid of comics.

84
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:05,679
Speaker 0: They're giving up on comics because they're not profitable, they don't bring anyone into the store, and they've had the kind of weak selection in the back for a long time anyway.

85
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,620
Speaker 1: It did look like they were sort of, like the trade selection was mad weak.

86
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,660
Speaker 1: I don't know if they're buying any more trades there, but I think they might keep the single-issue business going.

87
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:15,214
Speaker 1: Maybe.

88
00:05:15,321 --> 00:05:17,240
Speaker 1: Just, you know, for the people who come in every week.

89
00:05:17,361 --> 00:05:19,100
Speaker 0: I feel like they make all their money off of Microsoft.

90
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,780
Speaker 1: Because they don't have any local comic shop competition, you know?

91
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,328
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, what other comic shops?

92
00:05:23,348 --> 00:05:25,240
Speaker 0: There's that one down here in New Bern.

93
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,570
Speaker 1: I don't know if that one's still open.

94
00:05:26,772 --> 00:05:27,800
Speaker 1: That one was so shady.

95
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,918
Speaker 0: That was like, I mean, I've been to shady...

96
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,700
Speaker 1: That was the stereotypical bad comic shop taken to the extreme.

97
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,596
Speaker 0: I mean, that's the kind of place where the owner is surly and like, "You're not buying

98
00:05:36,657 --> 00:05:37,018
Speaker 0: anything?".

99
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:37,923
Speaker 1: Yeah.

100
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,400
Speaker 1: So anyway, apparently... They had the mind to shelf.

101
00:05:41,781 --> 00:05:43,833
Speaker 1: Yeah, the guy at the Dragon's Den, right?

102
00:05:43,874 --> 00:05:44,820
Speaker 1: The guy I always see there?

103
00:05:45,342 --> 00:05:48,698
Speaker 1: He said, you know, "Yeah, we're always, you know, we like to give one of

104
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:48,960
Speaker 1: each.".

105
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,338
Speaker 1: But he's like, "People came in here at 10 o'clock and I had two tables

106
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:53,740
Speaker 1: covered.".

107
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,515
Speaker 1: Because he had every single free comic book day comic.

108
00:05:56,555 --> 00:05:57,520
Speaker 1: He bought some of everything.

109
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,019
Speaker 1: Of course, he bought more of the Marvel and DC ones and less of the other ones, of course, right?

110
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:03,680
Speaker 1: But he got some of everything.

111
00:06:04,301 --> 00:06:08,560
Speaker 1: And at 10 o'clock, people busted in and they like took one of everything.

112
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,538
Speaker 1: Like some lady took one of everything and he was like, "Are you going to read all

113
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:11,720
Speaker 1: those?".

114
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,433
Speaker 1: She's like, "No, but why not?

115
00:06:13,453 --> 00:06:13,997
Speaker 1: They're all free,

116
00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:14,239
Speaker 1: right?".

117
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,520
Speaker 1: So the thing was, I would have read them all.

118
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:23,740
Speaker 1: So as a result of that, you know, I wasn't able to get many of the less popular, better ones.

119
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:28,080
Speaker 1: The only one I really wanted, I think there was like a Ninja Turtles 25th anniversary one.

120
00:06:28,602 --> 00:06:32,040
Speaker 1: You know, there were some other good ones, but I didn't want them too badly.

121
00:06:32,821 --> 00:06:37,416
Speaker 1: But anyway, so I don't think we're going to do a free comic book day episode this year.

122
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:41,599
Speaker 1: But that's the free comic book day news for you.

123
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:49,920
Speaker 1: What I do want to do is, you know, I do the Scott's box off and on, mostly off, right?

124
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:54,200
Speaker 0: I found a bunch of them when I was cleaning off the video on the tape recorder.

125
00:06:55,362 --> 00:07:00,120
Speaker 1: See, the question is, you know, those are just sort of, you know, they're sort of like one and done, right?

126
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:00,924
Speaker 1: Turn on the camera.

127
00:07:00,985 --> 00:07:03,300
Speaker 1: I do it and I turn the camera off and they're not really edited.

128
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,658
Speaker 1: So I was like, should I edit them or should I just upload them the way they are?

129
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:15,440
Speaker 1: Anyway, so, yeah, so so I want to discuss because people don't seem to realize this.

130
00:07:15,581 --> 00:07:15,702
Speaker 1: Right.

131
00:07:15,722 --> 00:07:17,617
Speaker 1: You order comics two months in advance.

132
00:07:17,718 --> 00:07:17,900
Speaker 1: Right.

133
00:07:18,601 --> 00:07:25,040
Speaker 1: So you think, OK, if you order comics two months in advance, what month is the big order going to be in?

134
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:25,662
Speaker 1: Right.

135
00:07:26,185 --> 00:07:29,360
Speaker 1: You think, well, when do people buy the most comics?

136
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:31,940
Speaker 1: And you might think, well, maybe they buy them on the holidays.

137
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:36,480
Speaker 1: So the big order comes in December, November, October, October must be the big month.

138
00:07:36,601 --> 00:07:36,863
Speaker 1: Right.

139
00:07:37,308 --> 00:07:38,520
Speaker 1: No, it's not October.

140
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,637
Speaker 1: Well, free comic days, a big month in May.

141
00:07:41,818 --> 00:07:42,060
Speaker 1: Right.

142
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,040
Speaker 1: So maybe, you know, April, March, March must be the big month.

143
00:07:47,202 --> 00:07:48,339
Speaker 1: No, it's not March.

144
00:07:49,121 --> 00:07:54,099
Speaker 1: The big month is May because in June, July is the San Diego Comic Con.

145
00:07:56,444 --> 00:07:57,520
Speaker 0: Ah, there's a good chance.

146
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,399
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure you go in and out there heading down there.

147
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,202
Speaker 1: Wow.

148
00:08:00,524 --> 00:08:03,439
Speaker 1: OK, I'd like to go there one day, but it's just too much.

149
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:04,386
Speaker 0: Well, you know what?

150
00:08:04,487 --> 00:08:06,219
Speaker 1: I was actually with limited vacations.

151
00:08:06,661 --> 00:08:07,727
Speaker 0: Well, I got plenty of vacation.

152
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,460
Speaker 0: I would if I weren't going to, you know, both taxes instead.

153
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:10,860
Speaker 0: Right.

154
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,021
Speaker 1: Right.

155
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:11,221
Speaker 1: Right.

156
00:08:11,582 --> 00:08:16,512
Speaker 1: OK, so anyway, in honor of the big order month, I'm going to.

157
00:08:16,532 --> 00:08:20,000
Speaker 1: I'm going to tell you the goods I'm buying here, some of which is very notable.

158
00:08:20,402 --> 00:08:20,865
Speaker 1: Are you ready?

159
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:21,609
Speaker 1: I'm just going to.

160
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:23,340
Speaker 1: I'm going to try to do it quickly and not dwell.

161
00:08:24,982 --> 00:08:27,639
Speaker 1: The much delayed Gunsmith Cat's Burst Volume four.

162
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,539
Speaker 1: Uncle Scrooge statue number two, which is Donald Duck.

163
00:08:32,962 --> 00:08:35,714
Speaker 0: Oh, so so you went for it.

164
00:08:35,734 --> 00:08:37,140
Speaker 0: You couldn't pass that up.

165
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:37,923
Speaker 1: I have a job now.

166
00:08:37,943 --> 00:08:40,236
Speaker 0: So you're going to have these big busts.

167
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,409
Speaker 1: They're not busting a full statue.

168
00:08:42,451 --> 00:08:43,639
Speaker 1: If it was a bust, I wouldn't have bought it.

169
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,645
Speaker 1: I don't like busts.

170
00:08:44,665 --> 00:08:45,329
Speaker 1: They're kind of stupid.

171
00:08:45,409 --> 00:08:47,300
Speaker 0: What if it was a bust of Scrooge McDuck?

172
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,145
Speaker 1: No, it's not good.

173
00:08:48,307 --> 00:08:49,820
Speaker 0: A high quality bronze one.

174
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,659
Speaker 1: You mean like a full like a big one, like the kind that you can tilt the head back and push a button and then a door opens?

175
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,140
Speaker 0: Yes, I'm talking a proper and full bust of Scrooge McDuck.

176
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,740
Speaker 1: This is a series of small statues and metal cases, so that's whatever.

177
00:09:02,884 --> 00:09:05,071
Speaker 1: There is a new comic from Vertigo.

178
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:07,700
Speaker 1: And whenever they have a new comic, the first issue is always cheap.

179
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,623
Speaker 1: I think it's a dollar.

180
00:09:09,065 --> 00:09:12,900
Speaker 1: And with my discount, it's twenty five cents called Greek Street.

181
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,965
Speaker 1: So we'll see what that's about.

182
00:09:13,985 --> 00:09:14,608
Speaker 0: Greek Street.

183
00:09:14,749 --> 00:09:15,171
Speaker 0: Yeah.

184
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:15,754
Speaker 0: Look that up.

185
00:09:15,794 --> 00:09:16,859
Speaker 0: You you keep talking.

186
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,338
Speaker 1: That's the new comic from vertical, not vertical vertigo that's coming out.

187
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,004
Speaker 1: Fables Volume twelve.

188
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:29,520
Speaker 1: Spider-Man number six hundred, which is five dollars, but it's supposed to be like one hundred something pages.

189
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:30,824
Speaker 1: So why the fuck not?

190
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:32,428
Speaker 1: Incredible Hulk.

191
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:36,800
Speaker 1: Six hundred people said you're going to find out who the Red Hulk is or whatever.

192
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,164
Speaker 0: What about the Blue Hulk?

193
00:09:38,506 --> 00:09:39,149
Speaker 0: The Orange Hulk?

194
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:40,334
Speaker 1: No, this is a red one.

195
00:09:40,374 --> 00:09:41,700
Speaker 1: It's been a story for a while.

196
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,520
Speaker 1: I got the first issue of the Red Hulk and I thought it was stupid, so I didn't get any more.

197
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:48,870
Speaker 1: And it's pretty much just like I only care who the Red Hulk is.

198
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:49,853
Speaker 1: The story is stupid.

199
00:09:49,873 --> 00:09:51,438
Speaker 0: Oh, oh, oh.

200
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,345
Speaker 0: Do you know what Greek Street is about?

201
00:09:53,465 --> 00:09:54,087
Speaker 1: What's it about?

202
00:09:54,187 --> 00:09:54,528
Speaker 0: All right.

203
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:58,100
Speaker 0: I'm stealing this from someone else who stole it from someone else.

204
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,220
Speaker 0: So I'm quoting someone, but I'm not even going to try to figure out who originally said this.

205
00:10:01,961 --> 00:10:07,720
Speaker 0: It's it's nothing like anything you've ever read before, according to some guy who are the artists and the writer, Peter Milligan.

206
00:10:08,361 --> 00:10:09,906
Speaker 0: OK, I don't know who that is, to be honest.

207
00:10:10,007 --> 00:10:13,560
Speaker 0: Now, I mean, the Greek Street is a street in London that runs through Soho.

208
00:10:13,761 --> 00:10:16,191
Speaker 0: And Soho is kind of like our red light district.

209
00:10:16,573 --> 00:10:18,199
Speaker 0: It's all the low lives and gangsters.

210
00:10:18,881 --> 00:10:26,600
Speaker 0: This story is a reimagining and retelling of those fantastic and brutal and visceral Greek legends played out on these modern streets.

211
00:10:27,221 --> 00:10:27,602
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

212
00:10:28,203 --> 00:10:29,146
Speaker 0: I'm looking forward to this.

213
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:29,967
Speaker 1: Anyway, we got Marvel 1985.

214
00:10:29,967 --> 00:10:30,649
Speaker 1: Remember, 1602.

215
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:36,440
Speaker 1: Well, this is sort of like 1985.

216
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,474
Speaker 0: Sixteen or two was good, but it didn't really need to be Marvel.

217
00:10:41,397 --> 00:10:42,140
Speaker 1: No, not really.

218
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,871
Speaker 1: But I mean, the Thor reveal was just awesome.

219
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:45,172
Speaker 1: Yeah.

220
00:10:45,192 --> 00:10:45,935
Speaker 1: But spoiler.

221
00:10:45,955 --> 00:10:47,000
Speaker 1: Oh, no.

222
00:10:48,862 --> 00:10:51,088
Speaker 1: I mean, that Thor reveals one of the best reveals ever.

223
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:55,060
Speaker 1: I'd say top 10, at least primarily because it's Thor.

224
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:56,243
Speaker 1: Yeah.

225
00:10:56,584 --> 00:11:02,140
Speaker 0: I mean, if anyone else, there's no other superhero that could be revealed in any way that I would care about at all.

226
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:06,653
Speaker 1: But Thor is mainly that I didn't see it come.

227
00:11:06,854 --> 00:11:07,134
Speaker 1: Let's see.

228
00:11:07,195 --> 00:11:09,040
Speaker 1: Annihilation classic and trade paperback.

229
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,168
Speaker 1: This was released in hardcover before and I was pissed.

230
00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:12,112
Speaker 1: Now it's in trade.

231
00:11:12,975 --> 00:11:14,220
Speaker 1: The boys trade paperback.

232
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,633
Speaker 1: Number four, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 25th anniversary.

233
00:11:18,673 --> 00:11:20,960
Speaker 1: This is what there was a free comic day comic for.

234
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:21,481
Speaker 1: Right.

235
00:11:21,521 --> 00:11:23,245
Speaker 1: So fuck, I'll just buy it if they're good.

236
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:24,288
Speaker 1: Right.

237
00:11:24,749 --> 00:11:29,420
Speaker 1: Dick Tracy, volume eight, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles collected book volume one.

238
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:37,920
Speaker 1: So if people don't realize this, it was it's common knowledge that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was originally a comic book by Eastman and Laird a long time ago.

239
00:11:38,642 --> 00:11:42,719
Speaker 1: And that, you know, the cartoon and what you know, is nothing like the original comic book.

240
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:48,340
Speaker 1: And the original comic book has been hard to get, you know, for normal people for a very long time.

241
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,363
Speaker 0: Even now with the Internet.

242
00:11:49,403 --> 00:11:54,760
Speaker 0: I mean, I remember when I was a kid, you know, watching the old cartoon and having the toys and everything, we're all into turtles.

243
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,562
Speaker 0: We're all playing the games.

244
00:11:56,224 --> 00:12:01,478
Speaker 0: But there was kind of this underground legend among the kids that there was some previous Ninja Turtles.

245
00:12:01,518 --> 00:12:02,360
Speaker 0: that was all cool.

246
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,725
Speaker 1: And I was in high school.

247
00:12:04,006 --> 00:12:05,954
Speaker 1: The Akira Mongo is like this legend.

248
00:12:06,496 --> 00:12:07,460
Speaker 1: And now I have it all.

249
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,686
Speaker 1: So this is going to be the sort of the same thing.

250
00:12:09,726 --> 00:12:14,260
Speaker 1: We're like, you know, yes, I know that Ninja Turtles is originally this awesome indie comic.

251
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,420
Speaker 1: Well, now normal people can finally get it in trade paperback.

252
00:12:18,401 --> 00:12:24,269
Speaker 1: Cursed Pirate Girl number three of three member who told us to buy?

253
00:12:24,309 --> 00:12:31,220
Speaker 1: Dave Peterson told us to buy that atomic robo shadow from beyond time for five surrogates.

254
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,269
Speaker 1: Volume two flesh and bone.

255
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:35,720
Speaker 0: I'm still waiting for a surrogates movie.

256
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,698
Speaker 1: 20th Century Boys, volume four, Pokemon Adventures, volume two.

257
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:41,702
Speaker 1: Right.

258
00:12:41,722 --> 00:12:44,031
Speaker 1: And there's one more thing I want to talk about a little bit more.

259
00:12:44,453 --> 00:12:46,320
Speaker 1: It's called Wednesday Comics, right?

260
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,307
Speaker 1: Let me let me explain this to you.

261
00:12:48,327 --> 00:12:50,155
Speaker 1: Wednesday Comics is coming from

262
00:12:50,195 --> 00:12:50,677
Speaker 1: D.C.,

263
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:51,240
Speaker 1: right?

264
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:03,840
Speaker 1: Now, back in the day, way back in the day, you would get things like when you bought a newspaper, you would get a comics insert like the spirit was like this section in the newspaper.

265
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:05,368
Speaker 1: That's what the spirit was.

266
00:13:05,428 --> 00:13:07,339
Speaker 1: It wasn't like a comic book on the shelf.

267
00:13:07,841 --> 00:13:10,990
Speaker 1: You know, the spirit was this insert into the newspaper.

268
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:14,540
Speaker 1: It was big like newspaper bag in full color.

269
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,304
Speaker 1: It was crazy.

270
00:13:15,646 --> 00:13:17,254
Speaker 1: And that would just come in the newspaper.

271
00:13:17,354 --> 00:13:18,420
Speaker 1: You didn't buy it on its own.

272
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:19,002
Speaker 1: Right.

273
00:13:19,684 --> 00:13:20,828
Speaker 1: So what D.C.

274
00:13:20,888 --> 00:13:24,580
Speaker 1: is doing, it says here, let me read this little story here.

275
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:33,040
Speaker 1: I'm going to put a link to this in the show at a time when many newspapers are cutting back or dying, cutting back in the comic sections.

276
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:33,461
Speaker 1: Right.

277
00:13:34,342 --> 00:13:34,863
Speaker 1: D.C.

278
00:13:34,943 --> 00:13:46,400
Speaker 1: is trying to remind people of the fun and excitement of full Sunday size comic section, even at a time like this, even at a time like this, except they're going to do it on Wednesday, because that's the day that new comic books are at the comic book store.

279
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,491
Speaker 1: That's why it's called Wednesday Comics as opposed to Sunday Comics.

280
00:13:50,194 --> 00:13:51,860
Speaker 1: This is a 12 part series.

281
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,787
Speaker 1: So there's going to be 12 issues, right?

282
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:55,333
Speaker 1: It's going to be weekly.

283
00:13:55,674 --> 00:13:57,200
Speaker 1: So that means four issues a month.

284
00:13:57,301 --> 00:13:58,449
Speaker 1: So three months, right?

285
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:00,000
Speaker 1: July, August, September.

286
00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:00,602
Speaker 1: Right.

287
00:14:00,622 --> 00:14:03,512
Speaker 1: So you preorder in May, June, July to get all of them.

288
00:14:03,633 --> 00:14:03,874
Speaker 1: Right.

289
00:14:04,215 --> 00:14:05,460
Speaker 1: So I'm buying all four of these.

290
00:14:06,341 --> 00:14:09,794
Speaker 1: And you might say, wait, Scott, why are you buying these normal issues?

291
00:14:09,995 --> 00:14:10,216
Speaker 1: Right.

292
00:14:10,256 --> 00:14:11,120
Speaker 1: What is wrong with you?

293
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,443
Speaker 1: Don't you wait for the trade?

294
00:14:12,464 --> 00:14:14,730
Speaker 1: I would indeed wait for the trade.

295
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,220
Speaker 1: In fact, I considered waiting for the trade until I read this part.

296
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:18,962
Speaker 1: That is next.

297
00:14:19,323 --> 00:14:19,663
Speaker 0: Great.

298
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,149
Speaker 1: The 12 part series launching this summer.

299
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:26,660
Speaker 1: that will be presented in a 14 inch by 20 inch broadsheet format.

300
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:33,959
Speaker 1: It will have to be unfolded and open to be read now for let's see, like four dollars an issue.

301
00:14:33,979 --> 00:14:34,079
Speaker 1: Right.

302
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,927
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, it's only what, 16 pages an issue.

303
00:14:38,987 --> 00:14:46,120
Speaker 1: It's not many pages, but 16 times four because you're folding it out into being four times the size.

304
00:14:46,861 --> 00:14:47,202
Speaker 1: Right.

305
00:14:47,563 --> 00:14:48,105
Speaker 1: So what's that?

306
00:14:48,145 --> 00:14:52,440
Speaker 1: Like sixty four because forty and then twenty four is sixty four.

307
00:14:52,841 --> 00:14:55,569
Speaker 0: So all I need to do to get you to buy stuff is to make it bigger.

308
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:58,177
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, it's more for your money, right?

309
00:14:58,217 --> 00:14:59,180
Speaker 1: That's the whole point.

310
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,081
Speaker 0: Is that all that matters?

311
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,105
Speaker 0: Well, that's all to be good.

312
00:15:02,546 --> 00:15:02,966
Speaker 1: Right now.

313
00:15:03,006 --> 00:15:03,828
Speaker 1: Wait, here is.

314
00:15:03,948 --> 00:15:04,188
Speaker 1: All right.

315
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:10,980
Speaker 1: So if that alone doesn't sell you, allow me to read the creator list.

316
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:12,664
Speaker 1: Are you ready for the creators?

317
00:15:14,068 --> 00:15:14,470
Speaker 0: Are you ready?

318
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,272
Speaker 0: No, not at all.

319
00:15:15,713 --> 00:15:16,094
Speaker 1: All right.

320
00:15:17,478 --> 00:15:17,880
Speaker 1: Let's see.

321
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,904
Speaker 1: Kyle Baker, Neil Gaiman, all red.

322
00:15:22,205 --> 00:15:22,565
Speaker 1: As are

323
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:22,845
Speaker 1: L.O.,

324
00:15:22,946 --> 00:15:33,500
Speaker 1: Paul Pope, Walt Simonson, Dave Bullock, Dave Givens, Ryan Sook, Jonna Crudy, Lee Bermejo, Joe Kubert, Ben Caldwell, Kurt Busiek, basically all huge names.

325
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:43,600
Speaker 0: See, this is interesting because I really feel like now is the time, especially, you know, people are saying the economy may have hit the bottom and it might start recovering in the industry, all the industries, every industry is in flux right now.

326
00:15:44,424 --> 00:15:47,540
Speaker 0: Now is the time to hit the market and hit the ground running with something different.

327
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,160
Speaker 1: Yeah.

328
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,222
Speaker 1: Now is the time to hit.

329
00:15:49,242 --> 00:15:50,425
Speaker 1: And that was just something different.

330
00:15:50,485 --> 00:15:53,391
Speaker 1: But to go for quality as opposed to quantity.

331
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:53,652
Speaker 1: Right.

332
00:15:53,692 --> 00:15:54,474
Speaker 1: Because if people.

333
00:15:54,935 --> 00:15:55,135
Speaker 1: Right.

334
00:15:55,175 --> 00:15:56,778
Speaker 1: If people are spending less.

335
00:15:57,239 --> 00:15:57,500
Speaker 1: Right.

336
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,648
Speaker 1: They're not going to be looking, you know, to get more.

337
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,752
Speaker 1: You know, people are trying to get rid of stuff.

338
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:03,993
Speaker 1: Right.

339
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:05,516
Speaker 1: They're selling their gold.

340
00:16:05,556 --> 00:16:07,500
Speaker 1: They're selling stuff, giving stuff away.

341
00:16:08,461 --> 00:16:10,665
Speaker 1: People want less stuff right now.

342
00:16:10,685 --> 00:16:20,300
Speaker 1: They want to get rid of stuff and have more money, which means if they buy things, they they're going to be looking for fewer quality things, not a bunch of cheap crap they don't need.

343
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,522
Speaker 0: Well, the smart people, at least.

344
00:16:22,803 --> 00:16:23,083
Speaker 1: Yes.

345
00:16:23,564 --> 00:16:37,883
Speaker 1: So now is the time to make, you know, quality things, things that stand out from the you know, the crowd, things that are more interesting, not something that someone, you know, is looking at and compares it to the stuff they're selling on Craigslist and said, I'm not going to buy that.

346
00:16:37,923 --> 00:16:39,104
Speaker 1: I'm selling something just like that.

347
00:16:39,785 --> 00:16:42,148
Speaker 1: So this is a good road to go down.

348
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:52,100
Speaker 1: And I mean, they got me to order for comics sight unseen for four dollars each, given there's a major discount on them because I go to DCV service.

349
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,361
Speaker 1: But, you know, regardless.

350
00:16:53,862 --> 00:16:54,102
Speaker 1: Right.

351
00:16:54,643 --> 00:16:56,946
Speaker 1: So this is is something special here.

352
00:16:57,326 --> 00:17:08,679
Speaker 1: You should look out and, you know, even if you don't preorder in July, go to the comic store once a week on Wednesday and buy the copy of Wednesday comics and watch out.

353
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:09,200
Speaker 0: It's coming.

354
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,301
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's good.

355
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:11,684
Speaker 1: You probably won't be able to miss it.

356
00:17:11,743 --> 00:17:14,248
Speaker 1: It's it'll look like a comic book, but it'll fold out.

357
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,512
Speaker 1: You know, it'll stand out on the shelf.

358
00:17:17,613 --> 00:17:19,936
Speaker 0: The Internet will be all the Twitter about it.

359
00:17:20,097 --> 00:17:20,396
Speaker 1: Yes.

360
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:21,740
Speaker 1: It's already a Twitter ring.

361
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:26,663
Speaker 0: So much more expected and at the same time, sad news.

362
00:17:27,204 --> 00:17:29,766
Speaker 0: If you missed it, CPM is actually gone.

363
00:17:29,806 --> 00:17:32,287
Speaker 0: They're declaring full on Chapter seven bankruptcy.

364
00:17:32,628 --> 00:17:33,128
Speaker 0: That's the end.

365
00:17:33,168 --> 00:17:39,212
Speaker 1: It's kind of weird because it's like there's a lot of anime companies out there and other companies in various niche areas.

366
00:17:39,272 --> 00:17:39,753
Speaker 1: that sort of.

367
00:17:40,033 --> 00:17:41,054
Speaker 1: they don't go out of business.

368
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:47,718
Speaker 1: They just sort of enter this holding pattern where, like, they're not bringing in big revenues, but they just don't spend anything.

369
00:17:47,738 --> 00:17:48,859
Speaker 1: They just stop doing business.

370
00:17:48,879 --> 00:17:49,800
Speaker 1: They just sort of sit there.

371
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:59,587
Speaker 1: And, you know, the revenue, as long as the revenue isn't zero, the money sort of trickles in, you know, and they just sort of let it sit and they don't have to go bankrupt or anything.

372
00:17:59,607 --> 00:18:01,048
Speaker 1: They just sort of stay still.

373
00:18:01,468 --> 00:18:02,909
Speaker 1: And that's what CPM has been doing.

374
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:06,712
Speaker 1: You know, they would go to conventions, sell all their extra DVDs on the cheap.

375
00:18:07,112 --> 00:18:13,617
Speaker 1: You know, they would, you know, continue, you know, making some DVDs available to, you know, write stuff or wherever Amazon, who knows?

376
00:18:13,657 --> 00:18:14,417
Speaker 0: Well, they were enacted.

377
00:18:14,457 --> 00:18:16,279
Speaker 0: I mean, they didn't pick up a title in over a year.

378
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:18,040
Speaker 1: No, they just in a holding pattern.

379
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:18,781
Speaker 0: But I never.

380
00:18:18,801 --> 00:18:20,862
Speaker 0: you know, the anime industry is so opaque.

381
00:18:21,202 --> 00:18:27,307
Speaker 0: There's no way to know if they actually had plans to come back or if this was just the long, slow burnout.

382
00:18:27,327 --> 00:18:29,068
Speaker 1: I don't think it was a slow burnout.

383
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:29,628
Speaker 1: I think they did.

384
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,390
Speaker 1: They were just in a holding pattern.

385
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,892
Speaker 0: But a holding pattern has to end with either the plane landing or the plane crashing.

386
00:18:35,052 --> 00:18:36,273
Speaker 1: It could just be a perpetual holding.

387
00:18:36,433 --> 00:18:37,034
Speaker 0: No, it can't.

388
00:18:37,354 --> 00:18:37,614
Speaker 1: Why not?

389
00:18:38,194 --> 00:18:39,976
Speaker 0: This is don't really work that way.

390
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,578
Speaker 0: Wouldn't if they weren't ever going to do anything.

391
00:18:43,078 --> 00:18:46,040
Speaker 1: I think they might have done something eventually, you know, but I wonder.

392
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:50,543
Speaker 1: I think what the thing is, when you're at when you're in a holding pattern, you have to.

393
00:18:50,623 --> 00:18:54,446
Speaker 1: if you're going to make a move, you have to be 100 percent sure it's the right move.

394
00:18:54,486 --> 00:18:56,687
Speaker 1: So you're going to stay in that holding pattern as long as you can.

395
00:18:56,987 --> 00:19:02,151
Speaker 1: And so you're sure that you're making the right move because if that move is the wrong move, you're at the same time.

396
00:19:02,251 --> 00:19:06,173
Speaker 0: I don't think there was any way for CPM to get themselves out of the situation they were in.

397
00:19:06,634 --> 00:19:09,716
Speaker 1: If they could have licensed one show and got it on TV or something.

398
00:19:09,976 --> 00:19:14,999
Speaker 0: But there's no way they could do that because it's almost impossible to get anime on actual television.

399
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:16,000
Speaker 0: You can only get it on the kind of.

400
00:19:17,061 --> 00:19:25,772
Speaker 1: I think what they also could have done is they could have found some way to, you know, they already had a bunch of licenses and they could have found, you know, new ways to get money off of them.

401
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:31,158
Speaker 1: You know, I mean, like if you if they were to put their stuff on Crunchyroll, you get money from that people.

402
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:32,620
Speaker 1: People pay for Crunchyroll.

403
00:19:33,487 --> 00:19:34,980
Speaker 0: What rights did they really have?

404
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,860
Speaker 0: The industry is so opaque and you didn't always get absolute rights to a show when you license it from Japan.

405
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:40,321
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's.

406
00:19:40,481 --> 00:19:41,224
Speaker 0: it might have had the right.

407
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:46,140
Speaker 0: We don't know what's going on DVDs, but not to digital distribution or licenses might have expired secretly.

408
00:19:46,481 --> 00:19:47,979
Speaker 0: It's there's no way for us to know.

409
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,540
Speaker 1: No, but CPM actually filed for actual bankruptcy.

410
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:52,583
Speaker 1: Bankruptcy.

411
00:19:52,704 --> 00:19:54,440
Speaker 1: What is the difference in Chapter seven and the others?

412
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:54,842
Speaker 1: Do we know?

413
00:19:54,882 --> 00:19:55,385
Speaker 1: Do we care?

414
00:19:55,405 --> 00:19:57,840
Speaker 0: Chapter seven means they're gone, completely gone.

415
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,101
Speaker 1: Yeah.

416
00:19:58,141 --> 00:20:00,640
Speaker 0: The other chapters mean that they'll come back, possibly.

417
00:20:00,861 --> 00:20:04,200
Speaker 1: OK, so what does it mean for the things that they owned?

418
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:05,390
Speaker 0: Everything's liquidated.

419
00:20:05,431 --> 00:20:06,179
Speaker 0: Creditors get paid.

420
00:20:06,701 --> 00:20:08,464
Speaker 0: OK, well, creditors, they can get paid.

421
00:20:08,524 --> 00:20:17,300
Speaker 0: as I as Animators Network so helpfully points out they have about one hundred thousand dollars in assets and about one point two million dollars in debts.

422
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,960
Speaker 1: Wait, one hundred thousand dollars in total assets.

423
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:20,502
Speaker 0: Yeah.

424
00:20:20,523 --> 00:20:21,340
Speaker 1: Hundred and twenty six.

425
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:33,230
Speaker 1: That means that the licenses for those properties, including things like Utena, Grave of the Fireflies, a judge, a psychic

426
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,272
Speaker 0: one before we go, I got to point they

427
00:20:35,292 --> 00:20:38,254
Speaker 1: were eleven and up to less than one hundred thousand dollars

428
00:20:38,314 --> 00:20:45,420
Speaker 0: in CPM was such a big deal is that they brought out a lot of the anime that was huge back in the day, like CPM was the shit.

429
00:20:45,622 --> 00:20:46,600
Speaker 1: Oh, they were definitely the shit.

430
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,200
Speaker 0: They were also had lots of shit, but they also had all the good stuff.

431
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,900
Speaker 0: I mean, look at this list, you know, the so-called prominent works noted on Anime News Network.

432
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:54,939
Speaker 0: This is just a fraction.

433
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:07,799
Speaker 0: Grave of the Fireflies, Utena, Patlabor, Lotus Wars, Slayers, Nod of the Galactic Railroad, Project Echo, Dominion Tank Police, Descendants of Darkness, Demon City, Shinjuku, Urochikidoji, Blue Girl.

434
00:21:09,081 --> 00:21:09,363
Speaker 1: Keep going.

435
00:21:10,272 --> 00:21:11,100
Speaker 0: I like how the list kind of.

436
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:11,548
Speaker 1: Didn't they have?

437
00:21:11,589 --> 00:21:12,220
Speaker 1: they were eleven?

438
00:21:13,246 --> 00:21:13,799
Speaker 0: Ah, probably.

439
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,910
Speaker 1: Let's get the freaking.

440
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:15,900
Speaker 1: they were eleven license.

441
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,459
Speaker 0: Jesus, we may not be able to.

442
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,658
Speaker 1: Someone's liquidating it.

443
00:21:19,384 --> 00:21:19,726
Speaker 0: We'll see.

444
00:21:19,766 --> 00:21:22,000
Speaker 0: I have it's less than one hundred thousand dollars.

445
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,282
Speaker 0: We don't know.

446
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:30,780
Speaker 0: if they only if ICV to reports that they only had those assets, then maybe the assets or the licenses weren't transferable.

447
00:21:31,141 --> 00:21:34,640
Speaker 1: No, because there's another news story that says ADV picked up some of them.

448
00:21:34,802 --> 00:21:35,740
Speaker 0: Yes, but not all of them.

449
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,020
Speaker 0: We don't know what's happening to all of them or if the licenses were transferable.

450
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:43,100
Speaker 0: Maybe their licenses from Japan that expire in the near future.

451
00:21:44,141 --> 00:21:45,869
Speaker 0: They could not for redistribution.

452
00:21:46,211 --> 00:21:48,220
Speaker 0: or maybe they have the right to the anime, but not for the dub.

453
00:21:48,301 --> 00:21:49,659
Speaker 0: But no one wants to make a new dub.

454
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:50,824
Speaker 1: I want the right.

455
00:21:50,844 --> 00:21:53,120
Speaker 1: So they were eleven because I could do some awesome shit with that.

456
00:21:53,320 --> 00:22:00,200
Speaker 0: Plus, Scott, quote, no specific value or an unknown value was assigned to the company's intellectual property rights and master tapes.

457
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,779
Speaker 1: Oh, well, there you go.

458
00:22:02,102 --> 00:22:04,099
Speaker 0: So the answer to that is we have no idea.

459
00:22:04,421 --> 00:22:04,641
Speaker 0: Yeah.

460
00:22:04,661 --> 00:22:07,630
Speaker 1: So the hundred thousand does not include the intellectual property.

461
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,900
Speaker 1: is that was the key part there that I did not know.

462
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:21,780
Speaker 0: But to get a sense of this, I mean, CVM basically put up the Big Apple Anime Festival, which I realize how old I was when I realized that that died almost a decade ago.

463
00:22:22,161 --> 00:22:25,882
Speaker 0: Yeah, that ran from like 2000 to 2003.

464
00:22:25,882 --> 00:22:27,057
Speaker 0: And then the Republicans killed it.

465
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:27,721
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

466
00:22:28,404 --> 00:22:32,440
Speaker 0: Well, I don't know if the I mean, the Republicans killed one and then they just never did any more after that.

467
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,500
Speaker 1: Well, I think the mistake of the Big Apple Anime Festival was not being in the Javits.

468
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,399
Speaker 1: And while the Javits sucks, you know, that's obviously how to do it.

469
00:22:40,721 --> 00:22:40,902
Speaker 0: Yeah.

470
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:45,620
Speaker 1: Plus, I mean, being in New York City in general, better a convention center that sucks than not a convention center.

471
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,240
Speaker 0: If you're not a professional con running your and you're going to be a big con.

472
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,740
Speaker 0: I mean, the above got, you know, seven, eight thousand people.

473
00:22:52,282 --> 00:22:54,060
Speaker 0: And I think it peaked at like eleven or twelve thousand.

474
00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:01,340
Speaker 0: But having that many people in New York City for a con, unless you were professionals, there is no way it is going to be a good con.

475
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,860
Speaker 0: And everyone I know who went to these generally didn't have a good time.

476
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,624
Speaker 0: There wasn't much to do.

477
00:23:05,664 --> 00:23:07,999
Speaker 0: And you kind of walk between all these buildings where nothing was going on.

478
00:23:08,442 --> 00:23:08,663
Speaker 0: Yep.

479
00:23:09,268 --> 00:23:10,759
Speaker 1: That's what I heard back in the day.

480
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:11,608
Speaker 0: CPM gone.

481
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,184
Speaker 0: A.D.V.

482
00:23:13,224 --> 00:23:15,600
Speaker 0: meanwhile, picking up everything they possibly can.

483
00:23:15,782 --> 00:23:17,660
Speaker 1: A.D.V.s meanwhile, is is there.

484
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,312
Speaker 1: They're also in a holding pattern.

485
00:23:19,352 --> 00:23:20,340
Speaker 1: They're not doing too well.

486
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:20,623
Speaker 1: Right.

487
00:23:20,643 --> 00:23:22,420
Speaker 1: I mean, like their manga all evacuated.

488
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,760
Speaker 1: Yen Press has Yotsuba.

489
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,540
Speaker 1: We're waiting for them to make a move on that.

490
00:23:25,841 --> 00:23:27,349
Speaker 1: You know, it's A.D.V.

491
00:23:27,369 --> 00:23:29,640
Speaker 1: still is apparently doing, you know, anime stuff.

492
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,180
Speaker 1: But when was the last time they actually put anything out?

493
00:23:32,301 --> 00:23:33,540
Speaker 1: Really, it's the game.

494
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,940
Speaker 1: The only games left in town are pretty much Viz and Funimation.

495
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:41,820
Speaker 1: And I guess Tokyo Pop kind of is in the manga town.

496
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,084
Speaker 0: But it's A.D.V.

497
00:23:43,124 --> 00:23:51,179
Speaker 0: is doing fine because you realize they got possibly the most important license, maybe the most dangerous license that's ever that ever has been available in the United States.

498
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,220
Speaker 1: No more need be said.

499
00:23:55,761 --> 00:23:56,063
Speaker 0: I don't know.

500
00:23:56,083 --> 00:24:04,500
Speaker 0: I feel like in the end, this consolidation is going to be good for the industry because it's really going to force the anime industry in the U.S.

501
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,155
Speaker 0: to trim the fat and kind of what it.

502
00:24:06,175 --> 00:24:06,700
Speaker 1: what did you read?

503
00:24:07,262 --> 00:24:15,920
Speaker 0: On good properties that will actually sell or in some way be marketable in the modern world with visual distribution and fan subs and crunchy roll.

504
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,120
Speaker 1: There is sort of one thing I realized the other day, right?

505
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:25,585
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, we always say to the anime companies, you know, it's it's because there's too much crap, right?

506
00:24:25,605 --> 00:24:28,500
Speaker 1: You license all this crap and you wonder why you're not making any money.

507
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,480
Speaker 1: If you only license the good stuff, you'll you'll make money.

508
00:24:31,661 --> 00:24:31,903
Speaker 1: Right.

509
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:33,860
Speaker 1: Well, if you really think about it right.

510
00:24:34,221 --> 00:24:39,380
Speaker 1: We simultaneously complain that no one buys the good stuff.

511
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:40,281
Speaker 1: Right.

512
00:24:40,908 --> 00:24:42,020
Speaker 1: So and it's true, right?

513
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,777
Speaker 1: The stuff that's really good, right?

514
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:50,080
Speaker 1: The stuff we love doesn't make the huge sales figures, you know, vertical with their awesome mangas, not so much sales.

515
00:24:50,601 --> 00:24:54,034
Speaker 1: You know, I mean, you know, they were 11, not so very these.

516
00:24:54,094 --> 00:24:56,483
Speaker 1: the really good stuff doesn't get the big sales.

517
00:24:56,583 --> 00:25:03,680
Speaker 1: And I think what it is, I think the people at the anime companies know what's good and what isn't, just like we know what's good and what isn't right.

518
00:25:04,304 --> 00:25:06,119
Speaker 1: But they know that what's good doesn't sell.

519
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:13,300
Speaker 1: So the thing is, imagine if I gave you a pile of anime, you took out all the good stuff, the stuff that you like, that you knew was awesome.

520
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:13,701
Speaker 1: Right.

521
00:25:14,005 --> 00:25:15,380
Speaker 1: And you said this will never sell.

522
00:25:15,501 --> 00:25:19,180
Speaker 1: And you put it aside and you look at this pile of crap that's left over.

523
00:25:20,201 --> 00:25:23,119
Speaker 1: You have to figure out which of that crap is going to sell and which isn't.

524
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,800
Speaker 0: So, you know, I think I don't think that's the way to look at it.

525
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,600
Speaker 0: I mean, look at the way the rest of the American media factory machine works in the US.

526
00:25:31,305 --> 00:25:33,440
Speaker 0: I use the word America and US in the same sentence.

527
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,484
Speaker 0: I'm very proud of that anyway.

528
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:38,040
Speaker 0: But it's not what will sell and what won't.

529
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,000
Speaker 0: It's what do we promote, therefore causing it to sell?

530
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,944
Speaker 0: And what do we don't?

531
00:25:43,466 --> 00:25:46,260
Speaker 0: And I think the anime industry was always kind of niche.

532
00:25:46,781 --> 00:25:47,625
Speaker 0: And they did.

533
00:25:47,725 --> 00:25:54,980
Speaker 0: I think they did a much better job marketing back in the day when they sold anime as check out this ultra violent crap from Japan.

534
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:56,324
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

535
00:25:56,886 --> 00:26:00,640
Speaker 0: I feel like that got more attention than, you know, they kind of like.

536
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,880
Speaker 0: there was the anime network, but it was this kind of on demand, half assed effort.

537
00:26:04,422 --> 00:26:05,880
Speaker 0: And Cartoon Network has a lot of action.

538
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:09,373
Speaker 0: Like Cartoon Network is straying so far from what it used to be.

539
00:26:09,393 --> 00:26:12,360
Speaker 0: that I mean, to not even show anime practically.

540
00:26:13,442 --> 00:26:19,220
Speaker 1: Well, I think part of it was that original marketing, while all the marketing they've done is sort of bad in design wise.

541
00:26:19,381 --> 00:26:19,602
Speaker 1: Right.

542
00:26:19,984 --> 00:26:24,485
Speaker 1: That original marketing was like you had these people who wanted something and it didn't really exist.

543
00:26:24,525 --> 00:26:27,626
Speaker 1: And it's like, here is that awesome thing you've been looking for.

544
00:26:27,707 --> 00:26:28,236
Speaker 1: Come and get it.

545
00:26:28,317 --> 00:26:28,500
Speaker 1: Right.

546
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:34,798
Speaker 1: Whereas the more recent marketing has been like the kids already know the Naruto is out there and they're like, hey, kids, Naruto.

547
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:35,985
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, we know.

548
00:26:36,186 --> 00:26:44,360
Speaker 0: But all the mainstream like the people who got into anime and became hardcore were punk kids, but they found anime by seeing it on TV.

549
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:49,360
Speaker 0: I mean, I wouldn't have gone searching for anime on the Internet if I hadn't seen Vampire Hunter D on the TV first and gone.

550
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:50,324
Speaker 1: Yep.

551
00:26:50,506 --> 00:26:51,659
Speaker 1: Wouldn't I go into the anime club?

552
00:26:52,563 --> 00:26:53,090
Speaker 1: That's for sure.

553
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:53,699
Speaker 1: Yeah.

554
00:26:54,581 --> 00:26:54,885
Speaker 1: All right.

555
00:26:55,169 --> 00:26:55,980
Speaker 0: Plus, I don't know.

556
00:26:56,201 --> 00:26:59,680
Speaker 0: It's really I still really don't know what to do with the anime industry.

557
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,100
Speaker 0: And sadly, I just want to point out neither does Japan.

558
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:11,500
Speaker 0: The big industry group, the Association of Japanese Animations, basically said that anime was, quote, a bubble several years ago that burst.

559
00:27:12,002 --> 00:27:12,567
Speaker 1: That's true.

560
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:13,960
Speaker 0: So this is in Japan.

561
00:27:14,082 --> 00:27:15,160
Speaker 0: Remember, not just in America.

562
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:19,700
Speaker 0: The marketplace is on a falling curve due to declining birth rates and the recession.

563
00:27:20,522 --> 00:27:26,300
Speaker 1: So I guess even in Japan, they think that anime is for kids and the fact that there's less kids is hurting anime sales.

564
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,451
Speaker 0: Well, there's an interesting quote in this article.

565
00:27:28,491 --> 00:27:40,422
Speaker 0: near the end, an unnamed producer told them, quote, It's because fans realized that more and more of the releases are the same kinds of titles with the shoujo and mecha elements added just because they are said to sell.

566
00:27:40,944 --> 00:27:54,059
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, that's something I mean, anime was originally awesome because you had like all these, you know, interesting plots, or at least even if, you know, now I see that many of them were, you know, formulaic, but there were new formulas.

567
00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:00,420
Speaker 1: to someone who is not from Japan, you know, at being, you know, growing up in the United States and seeing Looney Tunes my whole life.

568
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:00,802
Speaker 1: Right.

569
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:04,260
Speaker 1: Seeing, you know, an anime was like, oh, my God, it's something new.

570
00:28:04,421 --> 00:28:06,960
Speaker 1: And that's why it was exciting because it was new and different.

571
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,027
Speaker 0: And they were very much.

572
00:28:08,067 --> 00:28:11,000
Speaker 0: I mean, they couldn't bring everything out and it was difficult to get the licenses back then.

573
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:16,825
Speaker 0: They would they would pick and choose like for Shiggy Yugi is a pretty mediocre show, all things considered.

574
00:28:16,866 --> 00:28:19,303
Speaker 0: And if a show like that came out now, people would just like ignore it.

575
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:21,839
Speaker 0: But it was super popular in the US.

576
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:26,320
Speaker 0: And I think the reason was they picked a show like that for Shiggy Yugi.

577
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,420
Speaker 0: They decided this is the show like that, what we are going to push.

578
00:28:30,743 --> 00:28:32,180
Speaker 0: And it did really well as a result.

579
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,359
Speaker 0: And it became like the biggest freaking show in the world for a while.

580
00:28:37,202 --> 00:28:37,443
Speaker 1: Yeah.

581
00:28:37,483 --> 00:28:41,280
Speaker 1: And, you know, it's just that it's an animation.

582
00:28:41,481 --> 00:28:46,000
Speaker 1: It is definitely possible to make things that are new and different even today.

583
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,138
Speaker 1: I mean, look at like the awesome anime that does still come out like doing.

584
00:28:50,158 --> 00:28:51,462
Speaker 1: we just saw Skycrawlers.

585
00:28:51,904 --> 00:28:58,000
Speaker 1: We see Satoshi Kann stuff, sort of the samurai Miyazaki still doing shit.

586
00:28:58,321 --> 00:29:02,560
Speaker 1: You know, we see some cool Tezuka remakes of the recent Phoenix series.

587
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:09,060
Speaker 0: I still just feel like the the main thing that needs to be done is you've got to just market anime differently and actually just go after.

588
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,920
Speaker 1: But it's on the production side, you know, Studio 4C, right?

589
00:29:13,281 --> 00:29:27,080
Speaker 1: They need to, you know, pretty much make a lot more of the different and interesting, you know, animes and, you know, stop doing so many Mowei shows and so many typical crap robot shows.

590
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,060
Speaker 1: You got to go at the same time.

591
00:29:28,121 --> 00:29:29,499
Speaker 0: It was like that back then, too.

592
00:29:29,641 --> 00:29:31,999
Speaker 0: I mean, we'd watch the most dangerous show.

593
00:29:32,261 --> 00:29:34,419
Speaker 0: There were like a hundred other shows that were just like it.

594
00:29:34,661 --> 00:29:34,922
Speaker 0: Yeah.

595
00:29:34,963 --> 00:29:36,935
Speaker 1: But that was because we didn't know that.

596
00:29:37,983 --> 00:29:38,185
Speaker 0: Yeah.

597
00:29:38,206 --> 00:29:39,359
Speaker 0: That was new to us.

598
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,059
Speaker 0: Still, it all comes down to picking and choosing what you market.

599
00:29:42,422 --> 00:29:45,420
Speaker 0: Because remember, there was an old saying that the TV networks pushed a lot.

600
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,318
Speaker 0: It's new to me.

601
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:47,502
Speaker 1: Yeah.

602
00:29:47,663 --> 00:29:49,899
Speaker 1: The thing is, we need nothing's new to us now.

603
00:29:50,563 --> 00:29:50,644
Speaker 0: Yes.

604
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:51,998
Speaker 1: But we need more stuff that's new to us.

605
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:55,400
Speaker 0: Anime doesn't need to market to people like us because whatever we like, that's good.

606
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,187
Speaker 0: We'll just go out and get.

607
00:29:56,309 --> 00:29:57,340
Speaker 0: And that's not even a question.

608
00:29:57,701 --> 00:30:01,644
Speaker 0: What they need to do is take things like Cowboy Bebop or They Were Eleven or Sort of Samurai or whatever.

609
00:30:02,286 --> 00:30:07,439
Speaker 0: Find people who don't know that this sort of thing exists, but would probably like it and go after them.

610
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:16,100
Speaker 0: Because even if you take a formulaic show, I mean, sort of the samurai was pretty derivative and just show it to people who don't know that that sort of thing exists.

611
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,780
Speaker 1: Then I think you need both directions.

612
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:33,156
Speaker 1: You need to have, you know, because if you do that right, if you just keep showing the same old formulas to new people, right, what's going to happen is those new people will eventually also, you know, see that there's now.

613
00:30:33,196 --> 00:30:34,542
Speaker 1: there's nothing new and different for them.

614
00:30:34,703 --> 00:30:37,780
Speaker 1: You continue providing the new and different things constantly.

615
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,378
Speaker 0: Scott, that's a silly argument because every media is like that.

616
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:42,240
Speaker 0: And every other media is fine.

617
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:45,520
Speaker 0: I think anime is only different because of the way it's treated by the American.

618
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,340
Speaker 0: Just the American consumer thinks that cartoons by default are for kids.

619
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,587
Speaker 0: They don't get it and they ignore them.

620
00:30:50,929 --> 00:30:52,438
Speaker 0: And the industry just kind of ignores it.

621
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:53,624
Speaker 0: Whatever.

622
00:30:53,947 --> 00:30:55,380
Speaker 0: I feel like it's just a matter of marketing.

623
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:59,700
Speaker 0: I think that's the only thing standing between a successful anime industry in the U.S.

624
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,323
Speaker 0: and a failed one.

625
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:03,320
Speaker 0: Anyway, I don't think there's any other factor at this point.

626
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:03,922
Speaker 1: It's good.

627
00:31:04,143 --> 00:31:06,857
Speaker 1: We definitely agree that anime was a bubble a few years ago.

628
00:31:06,897 --> 00:31:07,400
Speaker 1: that is burst.

629
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:09,059
Speaker 1: There's no question about that one.

630
00:31:09,281 --> 00:31:13,594
Speaker 0: Well, it's interesting that Japan's having the same trouble, at least because they're the ones making it.

631
00:31:13,737 --> 00:31:13,920
Speaker 1: Right.

632
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:14,362
Speaker 1: Yeah.

633
00:31:14,402 --> 00:31:16,300
Speaker 1: But America all goes back to them in America.

634
00:31:16,421 --> 00:31:17,819
Speaker 0: We need to look at it from a different perspective.

635
00:31:18,222 --> 00:31:19,700
Speaker 0: All this stuff already exists.

636
00:31:19,821 --> 00:31:26,460
Speaker 0: And especially if the anime industry is not doing so well over there, you've got to get the licenses and take the risk and go for the marketing and go crazy.

637
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,119
Speaker 0: That was the time to do something just crazy.

638
00:31:34,803 --> 00:31:36,300
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

639
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,046
Speaker 0: What do you got for me?

640
00:31:38,378 --> 00:31:38,660
Speaker 1: All right.

641
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,322
Speaker 1: I remember now.

642
00:31:39,804 --> 00:31:44,760
Speaker 1: So this video as Adam West outside of a cave.

643
00:31:44,961 --> 00:31:50,661
Speaker 1: Supposedly the Batcave and he's selling all his Batman stuff, you know, and it's pretty funny.

644
00:31:50,781 --> 00:31:58,637
Speaker 0: I got a really, really big soft spot in my heart for Adam West because he, just like the Rick Roll, the Rick man, gets it.

645
00:31:59,500 --> 00:31:59,882
Speaker 0: He gets it.

646
00:32:00,303 --> 00:32:05,860
Speaker 0: People who get it when the Internet focuses its horrible, withering gaze upon them are my heroes.

647
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:06,361
Speaker 1: Yeah.

648
00:32:06,381 --> 00:32:14,400
Speaker 1: I mean, really what it is, it's like, you know, there there are some people right who become, you know, you know, they're famous for something.

649
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:14,781
Speaker 1: Right.

650
00:32:15,423 --> 00:32:23,720
Speaker 1: And sometimes someone is famous for something that is not so glamorous, you know, like Numa Numa, like Tiger Woods.

651
00:32:23,882 --> 00:32:25,240
Speaker 1: He's famous for something glamorous.

652
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,140
Speaker 1: He's the best golfer probably ever.

653
00:32:27,361 --> 00:32:27,662
Speaker 1: Right.

654
00:32:28,103 --> 00:32:33,630
Speaker 1: But, you know, Numa Numa guy, he's famous, but it's not a glamorous thing to be famous for.

655
00:32:33,711 --> 00:32:34,200
Speaker 0: Watch his name.

656
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,125
Speaker 0: I already forgot his name.

657
00:32:35,166 --> 00:32:37,460
Speaker 0: The guy who was arrested at Star Wars.

658
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:43,060
Speaker 1: Kid is the probably the extreme example of being famous for something and then not handling it properly.

659
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:43,642
Speaker 1: Right.

660
00:32:44,325 --> 00:32:48,040
Speaker 1: So when you see people like Rick Astley or Adam West.

661
00:32:48,622 --> 00:32:48,904
Speaker 1: Right.

662
00:32:49,025 --> 00:32:50,900
Speaker 1: It's like they're famous for something.

663
00:32:51,422 --> 00:32:54,079
Speaker 1: They know that what they're famous for is kind of.

664
00:32:54,803 --> 00:32:55,046
Speaker 1: Right.

665
00:32:55,147 --> 00:32:55,511
Speaker 1: It's not.

666
00:32:55,531 --> 00:32:56,279
Speaker 1: it's not cool.

667
00:32:56,821 --> 00:32:57,103
Speaker 1: Right.

668
00:32:57,425 --> 00:33:00,280
Speaker 1: But their attitude makes it awesome.

669
00:33:00,601 --> 00:33:06,580
Speaker 1: You know, it's like if you have the right attitude about it, then you're sort of laughing at yourself with everyone.

670
00:33:06,681 --> 00:33:09,780
Speaker 1: It's like as opposed to being laughed at and being a turd.

671
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:15,236
Speaker 0: Well, more importantly, they have both realized that they can make money off of it just by going with it.

672
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:22,912
Speaker 0: I mean, because I mean, what Adam West does, he voice acts himself on Family Guy in possibly the most self-deprecating way.

673
00:33:23,012 --> 00:33:24,320
Speaker 0: I've ever seen someone do that.

674
00:33:24,621 --> 00:33:24,823
Speaker 1: Yeah.

675
00:33:24,843 --> 00:33:26,700
Speaker 1: And also, you know, think about it in this way.

676
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,041
Speaker 1: Right.

677
00:33:27,683 --> 00:33:33,804
Speaker 1: Why is, you know, Adam West or whatever, you know, why is it humorous and entertaining?

678
00:33:33,824 --> 00:33:36,080
Speaker 1: It's because you're laughing at the corniness.

679
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:36,261
Speaker 1: Right.

680
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:39,300
Speaker 1: When you watch that Batman movie, you're laughing at the shark repellent.

681
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:39,661
Speaker 1: Right.

682
00:33:40,363 --> 00:33:56,301
Speaker 1: Now, if, you know, Adam West was all like, you know, depressed and unhappy and had this bad attitude about it, then that even that corny movie would have a different, you know, aspect of you know, it wouldn't be the same right for the viewer.

683
00:33:56,803 --> 00:34:03,387
Speaker 1: So because he has that attitude, it actually enhances the entertainment value of the corny things.

684
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:15,799
Speaker 1: he that he's got the good attitude about, you know, like Rick Astley's song, if Rick Astley like didn't get it and was sort of a jerk, you know, then there's three rolling wouldn't work so well, it would depower the.

685
00:34:15,819 --> 00:34:19,739
Speaker 0: really though, because Rick rolling went for a long time before Rick Astley found out.

686
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,179
Speaker 1: I'll give you I'll give you an example of depowering.

687
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:22,643
Speaker 1: Right.

688
00:34:22,967 --> 00:34:23,920
Speaker 1: Snakes on a plane.

689
00:34:24,322 --> 00:34:24,603
Speaker 1: Right.

690
00:34:24,704 --> 00:34:27,139
Speaker 0: Well, they totally had the wrong attitude about it.

691
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:31,020
Speaker 1: They went for commercialization and they weren't taking it in jest.

692
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:34,320
Speaker 1: They were taking it like this serious sort of business thing.

693
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:39,244
Speaker 1: And with that wrong attitude, as soon as that movie came out, snakes on a plane was gone.

694
00:34:39,344 --> 00:34:41,880
Speaker 0: See, the thing is, God, I don't know if that was so much the attitude.

695
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:47,005
Speaker 0: I think it's just that they actually thought they could make something funny and they just didn't get it.

696
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:48,518
Speaker 1: Well, I think that it was.

697
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:54,389
Speaker 1: See, it wasn't a. it wasn't the same bad attitude that, say, the Star Wars kid has, but it was a different bad.

698
00:34:54,411 --> 00:34:55,320
Speaker 0: That's what I was about to say.

699
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,487
Speaker 0: There are three ways to go.

700
00:34:56,547 --> 00:34:58,519
Speaker 0: There's the you get it and you go with it.

701
00:34:58,941 --> 00:35:01,499
Speaker 0: There's the you don't get it and you're sad or angry about it.

702
00:35:01,961 --> 00:35:08,259
Speaker 0: And then there's the big old Venn diagram here, but the third one, the important one, the one that is sad, but also kind of funny.

703
00:35:08,761 --> 00:35:13,683
Speaker 0: The people who don't understand and think that they're having a resurgence of popularity.

704
00:35:13,704 --> 00:35:16,940
Speaker 0: I mean, what if Rick Astley had been mad?

705
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,979
Speaker 0: My career is coming back and he made a new album.

706
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:19,621
Speaker 1: Yeah.

707
00:35:19,642 --> 00:35:26,259
Speaker 1: See, there are some people that, you know, I think the saddest right is the people who just don't even realize anything at all.

708
00:35:26,721 --> 00:35:31,540
Speaker 1: Like, I don't know, sort of like like the Carmel dancing people.

709
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:32,642
Speaker 1: Right.

710
00:35:33,045 --> 00:35:34,920
Speaker 1: Or I don't know, the Lloyd to my people.

711
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,148
Speaker 1: They they know what's up.

712
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:37,600
Speaker 0: I think they figured it out.

713
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,960
Speaker 0: I think someone actually showed it to them.

714
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:42,000
Speaker 0: I found there's an article talking about did I do the Carmel dance people?

715
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:42,627
Speaker 1: They don't know.

716
00:35:42,768 --> 00:35:43,133
Speaker 1: They might.

717
00:35:43,173 --> 00:35:43,456
Speaker 1: I don't know.

718
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,142
Speaker 1: I don't know.

719
00:35:44,464 --> 00:35:46,376
Speaker 1: But it's like, you know, those kind of things.

720
00:35:46,416 --> 00:35:50,220
Speaker 1: where it's like, you know, they have this opportunity to make a big move.

721
00:35:50,662 --> 00:35:50,925
Speaker 1: Right.

722
00:35:50,966 --> 00:35:52,100
Speaker 1: But they don't make any move.

723
00:35:52,281 --> 00:35:53,105
Speaker 1: And you worry.

724
00:35:53,245 --> 00:35:56,180
Speaker 1: You wonder if they even know Adam West knows.

725
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:03,219
Speaker 0: So YouTube Poop is not funny, by and large, is don't don't even consider.

726
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,600
Speaker 1: It has nothing to do with feces, as far as I know.

727
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,999
Speaker 0: Don't even consider looking for YouTube Poops trying to find a good one.

728
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:20,097
Speaker 0: But randomly and by randomly, I mean, because Wyatt told us to search for poop on YouTube because he was bored, because he promised we would find something funny, which we did, which was not this.

729
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,639
Speaker 0: But this is actually a pretty funny YouTube Poop.

730
00:36:26,102 --> 00:36:28,480
Speaker 0: But really, only if you know something about Pokemon.

731
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:29,683
Speaker 0: I don't know.

732
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:31,260
Speaker 0: There were some jokes in this one.

733
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,299
Speaker 1: I think the only really funny part was in the Pokedex was talking to him.

734
00:36:35,002 --> 00:36:36,099
Speaker 0: There were a couple other good bits.

735
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:44,579
Speaker 0: But if you're ever going to watch a YouTube Poop or you wonder what YouTube Poop is, watch this one, because it's it's funny enough to where you won't have wasted your five minutes.

736
00:36:44,942 --> 00:36:48,180
Speaker 0: But at the same time, it shows you exactly what a YouTube Poop is.

737
00:36:48,281 --> 00:36:49,280
Speaker 0: And you'll never have to wonder.

738
00:36:49,862 --> 00:36:51,400
Speaker 0: You'll never have to try to watch one.

739
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,480
Speaker 0: You'll never have to hurt yourself.

740
00:36:52,901 --> 00:36:53,062
Speaker 1: Yeah.

741
00:36:53,122 --> 00:37:00,285
Speaker 1: This is all I have to say about YouTube Poop is that I've known about them for a while and I sort of I knew what they were, but I never really bothered because stupid, you

742
00:37:00,466 --> 00:37:02,134
Speaker 0: know, like they're kind of like, so

743
00:37:02,235 --> 00:37:06,280
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure this one that we think is fun that we think is good is really old.

744
00:37:06,521 --> 00:37:07,999
Speaker 1: It probably is really, very likely.

745
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:12,620
Speaker 0: But very few people I know know about, care about or watch YouTube Poop.

746
00:37:13,382 --> 00:37:14,205
Speaker 1: Yeah.

747
00:37:14,908 --> 00:37:18,120
Speaker 0: The I feel like these are actually very similar to AMV Hell.

748
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:28,002
Speaker 0: They're like the Internet 4chan kid who may or may not necessarily even know anything about anime, who is making the same kind of joke that an AMV Hell is making.

749
00:37:28,666 --> 00:37:31,120
Speaker 1: The only thing about these is that I look at them.

750
00:37:32,062 --> 00:37:32,243
Speaker 1: Right.

751
00:37:32,263 --> 00:37:41,079
Speaker 1: And while it's not sort of well done in a production sense, it actually takes quite a bit of, you know, labor to make something like this.

752
00:37:41,361 --> 00:37:42,246
Speaker 1: You know, I mean, it's not.

753
00:37:42,266 --> 00:37:46,379
Speaker 1: you know, it's not like, you know, incredibly hard, like making a good video is.

754
00:37:47,002 --> 00:37:53,079
Speaker 1: But it's not like just trivial, like someone just clicks a few buttons and it comes out, you know, some some work went into this poop.

755
00:37:53,742 --> 00:38:04,580
Speaker 1: It was effortful poop, which is sort of, you know, when you think about like what the person must have done in their video editor to make this, it's like, huh, it took him like a few hours, possibly even more.

756
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:07,479
Speaker 1: It's like, hey, there's something there's something new to that.

757
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:13,665
Speaker 0: So well, tonight we're going to talk about a somewhat old manga that I hope many of you have already read.

758
00:38:13,726 --> 00:38:15,800
Speaker 0: And we're going to do a final thought to some point in the future.

759
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:26,000
Speaker 1: But if you have not read Monster by Naoki Urasawa, it's just Naoki Urasawa like we might as well just change Wednesday to Naoki Urasawa.

760
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,640
Speaker 0: You realize right now I'm reading three manga.

761
00:38:29,202 --> 00:38:32,960
Speaker 0: I'm reading Monster, Pluto and 20th Century Boys.

762
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:38,559
Speaker 1: The reason for this is that Monster has been coming out from Viz and the Signature Series for a long time now.

763
00:38:39,002 --> 00:38:42,480
Speaker 1: And the final volume, the 18th volume, was released in December.

764
00:38:43,023 --> 00:38:46,040
Speaker 1: So once I saw that, I just said, you know what, fuck it.

765
00:38:46,101 --> 00:38:47,238
Speaker 1: And I ordered all the volumes.

766
00:38:47,541 --> 00:38:47,801
Speaker 1: Right.

767
00:38:48,604 --> 00:38:59,884
Speaker 1: And then in January, Pluto one and 20th Century Boys one came out and every month in the year of 2009, at least one volume of one of those two is going to come out every month.

768
00:38:59,944 --> 00:39:09,356
Speaker 1: So when you go to the comic store to get Wednesday comics, look for, you know, the Naoki Urasawa shelf and you'll probably get like three or four volumes of each over there.

769
00:39:10,341 --> 00:39:12,400
Speaker 0: But Monster, well, pretty much everything he does.

770
00:39:12,782 --> 00:39:14,420
Speaker 1: This is the year of Naoki Urasawa.

771
00:39:15,181 --> 00:39:20,360
Speaker 0: If you want psychological thrillers or detective manga, he's the master.

772
00:39:20,681 --> 00:39:21,939
Speaker 0: He's pretty much got this down.

773
00:39:22,261 --> 00:39:23,139
Speaker 0: He's the grand master.

774
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:35,199
Speaker 0: And the cool thing is I'd recommend just for roller coaster syndrome, read Monster first and then read Pluto and 20th Century Boys, because I think you can really see him progressing as a manga artist.

775
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,667
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, and there are older manga than Monster also, you know, that we just don't have in the US.

776
00:39:39,687 --> 00:39:41,440
Speaker 1: Like we don't have the master Keaton manga.

777
00:39:41,521 --> 00:39:42,700
Speaker 1: We have the anime, though, right?

778
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,798
Speaker 0: The anime is pretty bad ass.

779
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:49,781
Speaker 1: We don't have like a Yawara fashionable Judo girl, which I always kind of wanted to see.

780
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:54,220
Speaker 1: You know, that's that was like his first really big popular thing.

781
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:57,099
Speaker 1: There was like even, I think, a long running anime based on it, too.

782
00:39:57,581 --> 00:39:58,860
Speaker 0: What about Dancing Policeman?

783
00:39:59,662 --> 00:40:00,310
Speaker 1: I never heard of that.

784
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:01,080
Speaker 0: There's only one volume.

785
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,120
Speaker 1: Didn't he also make something like Pineapple Army?

786
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:04,165
Speaker 0: Yeah, yes.

787
00:40:04,206 --> 00:40:04,860
Speaker 0: Pineapple Army.

788
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,239
Speaker 1: Yeah, we don't have that either.

789
00:40:06,802 --> 00:40:07,097
Speaker 0: Jigoro.

790
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:09,439
Speaker 1: Well, what's the thing he's making now?

791
00:40:10,326 --> 00:40:10,719
Speaker 0: Billy Bat.

792
00:40:11,262 --> 00:40:12,178
Speaker 1: Is that what he's making now?

793
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,520
Speaker 0: Started in October 2008 and I don't know anything else about it.

794
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:19,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're probably not going to get that until Pluto and 20th Century Boys are done.

795
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:19,979
Speaker 0: Which is fine.

796
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, but, you know, you see what's going on here.

797
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,260
Speaker 1: We're basically we're on a no Kiyorasawa delay.

798
00:40:26,423 --> 00:40:27,639
Speaker 1: We're getting a delayed feed.

799
00:40:28,281 --> 00:40:31,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is probably fine because Monster in and of itself is great.

800
00:40:31,901 --> 00:40:41,584
Speaker 0: But if you've seen if you've seen the Monster anime, just kind of a forward here, a preface, you you can read the manga and you probably should read the manga because the manga is what it's based on.

801
00:40:41,644 --> 00:40:44,355
Speaker 0: But the anime is literally just that.

802
00:40:44,395 --> 00:40:48,019
Speaker 0: they use the manga as storyboards and made the anime like frame for frame.

803
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:48,722
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

804
00:40:49,385 --> 00:40:52,180
Speaker 1: Well, the other thing is that, you know, I never watched much of the anime.

805
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,580
Speaker 1: I think I watched an episode two at the most way back in the day.

806
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,664
Speaker 1: So I barely remember.

807
00:40:57,287 --> 00:41:00,903
Speaker 1: But I do what I you know, and back then I wasn't as intelligent as I am now.

808
00:41:00,943 --> 00:41:02,900
Speaker 1: I didn't know the name Nyoka or Asawa.

809
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,428
Speaker 1: I didn't know anything.

810
00:41:04,509 --> 00:41:07,189
Speaker 1: All I knew is that there's some new anime called Monster.

811
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:07,979
Speaker 1: It's about doctors.

812
00:41:08,201 --> 00:41:08,843
Speaker 1: That's what I knew.

813
00:41:09,626 --> 00:41:13,722
Speaker 1: And, you know, I watched that, you know, first episode or two back in the day.

814
00:41:14,204 --> 00:41:18,423
Speaker 1: And apparently they weren't exciting enough for me to watch any more back in the day.

815
00:41:18,604 --> 00:41:22,024
Speaker 0: Well, I was watching Monster as well while I was living in the mountains bored out of my mind.

816
00:41:22,084 --> 00:41:26,001
Speaker 0: And I got about 13 episodes in and it just wasn't doing it for me.

817
00:41:26,664 --> 00:41:34,180
Speaker 0: But then I pick up the manga, you know, years later and I just read through the first one and I burned through about three and a half to four of these things the day on the.

818
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:38,980
Speaker 1: Well, I think there's something about it where it's like it just it's so quick to read.

819
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:46,149
Speaker 1: I mean, manga is generally quick to read compared to, say, Stanley, you know, just about comics from anywhere else.

820
00:41:46,189 --> 00:41:47,660
Speaker 1: Manga is made to be a quick read.

821
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,920
Speaker 1: You know, these read real fast.

822
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,680
Speaker 1: You can literally like the pages like on fire.

823
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:53,748
Speaker 1: I'm turning so fast.

824
00:41:53,828 --> 00:41:54,070
Speaker 1: Right.

825
00:41:54,452 --> 00:41:55,399
Speaker 1: And it doesn't help.

826
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:55,761
Speaker 1: Right.

827
00:41:55,841 --> 00:41:58,640
Speaker 1: Or Asawa that he's doing a suspense thriller.

828
00:41:59,201 --> 00:42:08,180
Speaker 1: So basically, imagine if you're watching like this incredibly suspenseful mystery movie and you could fast forward it without it getting all squealy.

829
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,259
Speaker 1: You could still get the full experience and you can turn the pages real quick.

830
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,180
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, my God, you're like turning the pages as fast as humanly possible.

831
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,160
Speaker 0: This is the interesting part with Monster.

832
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:18,866
Speaker 0: We just have it all.

833
00:42:18,907 --> 00:42:20,059
Speaker 0: We can just read it just that.

834
00:42:20,381 --> 00:42:25,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I bought every volume or like Eska Flonie did that with the cliffhanger at the end of every freaking episode.

835
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,872
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, well, cliffhanger.

836
00:42:26,912 --> 00:42:27,720
Speaker 1: Got to watch the next one.

837
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:28,423
Speaker 1: Oh, God, watch next.

838
00:42:28,464 --> 00:42:31,440
Speaker 0: You just keep watching with Pluto and 20th Century Boys.

839
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:34,999
Speaker 1: I have to wait because we don't have all the volumes at once.

840
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:42,039
Speaker 0: Of course, I point out enough because he hasn't read Monster yet, but he read all of 20th Century Boys because he read the first one and he couldn't deal with it.

841
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,499
Speaker 0: So he just got a cancellation.

842
00:42:43,681 --> 00:42:44,920
Speaker 0: He got the rest of it immediately.

843
00:42:45,942 --> 00:42:48,019
Speaker 1: So I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to read it as it comes out.

844
00:42:48,541 --> 00:42:51,599
Speaker 1: And then when the last volume shows up, I'm not going to read it.

845
00:42:52,021 --> 00:42:54,459
Speaker 1: I'm going to reread all the other volumes and then read the last one.

846
00:42:55,424 --> 00:42:55,869
Speaker 1: You like that?

847
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:56,820
Speaker 1: That's my strategy.

848
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,869
Speaker 0: That's a pretty good strategy.

849
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:58,980
Speaker 1: to see that strategy.

850
00:42:59,482 --> 00:42:59,724
Speaker 1: Right.

851
00:42:59,764 --> 00:43:03,000
Speaker 1: You sort of you got because you don't really remember what you read.

852
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:03,964
Speaker 0: God, you know what you're doing?

853
00:43:03,984 --> 00:43:11,500
Speaker 0: You're doing to yourself a Gundam where the two episodes before the final story arc are just the recap episode.

854
00:43:12,401 --> 00:43:17,720
Speaker 1: But the thing is, when it's an anime, I hate the recap because I marathon the anime.

855
00:43:18,082 --> 00:43:21,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if I didn't marathon the anime, the recap would be helpful.

856
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,391
Speaker 0: Except in Gundam shows.

857
00:43:22,411 --> 00:43:23,420
Speaker 0: Well, Gundam seed at least.

858
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:29,218
Speaker 0: I love the recap because it was just counting how many times the names of different people who had died were yelled.

859
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,779
Speaker 1: Yeah, rusty, rusty, Miguel.

860
00:43:35,463 --> 00:43:36,938
Speaker 1: You were never even on screen.

861
00:43:37,842 --> 00:43:39,778
Speaker 0: Miguel Rossi died in one episode one.

862
00:43:40,542 --> 00:43:41,931
Speaker 1: Yeah.

863
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:43,220
Speaker 1: Oh, you never even saw his face.

864
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,659
Speaker 1: You just saw him wearing a suit now.

865
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,680
Speaker 1: I think they had a photograph of him later.

866
00:43:46,963 --> 00:43:48,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, like hanging in someone's locker.

867
00:43:48,722 --> 00:43:50,380
Speaker 0: Like I would swear people yelled his name.

868
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,518
Speaker 0: Didn't even know who he was.

869
00:43:52,261 --> 00:43:54,610
Speaker 1: So one star monster is.

870
00:43:56,076 --> 00:43:57,000
Speaker 0: this is the story.

871
00:43:57,605 --> 00:43:59,080
Speaker 0: Obviously, no spoilers here.

872
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,256
Speaker 0: We're reviewing this to convince you to read it.

873
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:02,301
Speaker 0: Yes.

874
00:44:02,321 --> 00:44:08,520
Speaker 0: Monster is the story of a doctor, a brilliant doctor from Japan who has moved to Germany.

875
00:44:09,531 --> 00:44:09,920
Speaker 1: Ah, the Germans.

876
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,780
Speaker 0: He is dating the daughter of the director of a big hospital.

877
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,759
Speaker 0: He's a neurosurgeon.

878
00:44:14,224 --> 00:44:15,299
Speaker 0: He's a rising star.

879
00:44:15,601 --> 00:44:17,660
Speaker 0: He's like everything is going right for him.

880
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:20,440
Speaker 0: He's like the biggest, baddest neurosurgeon ever.

881
00:44:21,021 --> 00:44:24,160
Speaker 0: And the director of the hospital is kind of propping him up and pushing him forward.

882
00:44:24,581 --> 00:44:25,839
Speaker 0: He's destined for great things.

883
00:44:26,721 --> 00:44:32,180
Speaker 1: And one day he's got nepotism, but he's also got skills and he's got everything's awesome.

884
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,539
Speaker 1: And he's also a really nice dude.

885
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:35,326
Speaker 0: He's wealthy.

886
00:44:35,346 --> 00:44:36,340
Speaker 0: He's got a beautiful wife.

887
00:44:36,462 --> 00:44:37,259
Speaker 0: Everything's going great.

888
00:44:37,943 --> 00:44:39,495
Speaker 0: And one day he operate.

889
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:45,040
Speaker 0: He is going to operate on a man who came in some poor Turkish immigrant who had an accident.

890
00:44:45,622 --> 00:44:49,000
Speaker 0: But he is told by the hospital to operate on an important political figure instead.

891
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:49,201
Speaker 1: Yeah.

892
00:44:49,221 --> 00:44:52,260
Speaker 1: Basically, the mayor gets hurt and the mayor is like brought into the hospital.

893
00:44:52,722 --> 00:44:55,120
Speaker 1: So they say, oh, you go work on the mayor.

894
00:44:55,262 --> 00:44:55,932
Speaker 1: He just came in.

895
00:44:55,952 --> 00:44:56,439
Speaker 1: Oh, shit.

896
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,059
Speaker 1: And they put someone else will take care of the Turkish guy who you were scheduled to take care of.

897
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,458
Speaker 0: And that doctor is not that good.

898
00:45:01,983 --> 00:45:02,247
Speaker 1: Yeah.

899
00:45:02,389 --> 00:45:03,079
Speaker 0: Another doctor.

900
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:03,501
Speaker 1: Yeah.

901
00:45:03,521 --> 00:45:05,539
Speaker 1: I mean, that other doctor is a really nice, great guy.

902
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,299
Speaker 1: He's a he's a character and he's in throughout the whole story, you know.

903
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:14,280
Speaker 1: But, you know, he is, you know, the main character is the best doctor there is.

904
00:45:14,481 --> 00:45:15,960
Speaker 0: Well, the best neurosurgeon, of course.

905
00:45:16,241 --> 00:45:18,319
Speaker 0: He basically later in the manga is blackjack.

906
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,320
Speaker 1: Well, he's he was blackjack from the beginning, right?

907
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:28,880
Speaker 1: Because the beginning of this story, this first volume or so is the is sort of like this typical hospital drama story.

908
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,560
Speaker 1: And I see this particular hospital drama with the evil hospital administration.

909
00:45:35,244 --> 00:45:36,520
Speaker 1: I see that in a lot of places.

910
00:45:36,601 --> 00:45:37,740
Speaker 1: You know, I see it in blackjack.

911
00:45:38,122 --> 00:45:40,839
Speaker 1: I see it in Ray, which was also sort of a blackjack.

912
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,139
Speaker 0: Ray is just blackjack, too.

913
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's not by Tessa Gray.

914
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:44,223
Speaker 0: Right.

915
00:45:44,284 --> 00:45:45,038
Speaker 0: Still blackjack, too.

916
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:49,300
Speaker 1: I see it in pretty much any manga involving hospitals.

917
00:45:49,401 --> 00:45:52,660
Speaker 1: I see sort of like a trauma center a little bit.

918
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:53,042
Speaker 1: Right.

919
00:45:53,444 --> 00:45:56,720
Speaker 1: It's the same story of the administration of the hospital is evil.

920
00:45:57,182 --> 00:46:01,140
Speaker 1: And the doctors who are awesome just want to save lives.

921
00:46:01,581 --> 00:46:06,619
Speaker 1: And the evil business of the hospital, you know, which is trying to run it as a business is ruining it.

922
00:46:07,301 --> 00:46:16,460
Speaker 1: And, you know, this all comes from the fact that Tezuka himself went to medical school, became a doctor and then was a manga artist.

923
00:46:17,382 --> 00:46:21,760
Speaker 1: Instead of being a doctor because of evil hospital administration, as he saw it.

924
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:25,480
Speaker 0: And if anyone draws heavily from Tezuka, it is Ursa.

925
00:46:25,862 --> 00:46:27,440
Speaker 1: Oh, you read Monster.

926
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,000
Speaker 1: And it's the reason that he's the one who's doing Pluto.

927
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:30,160
Speaker 1: Right.

928
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:41,720
Speaker 0: If you have read like most of Tezuka's work in English and you read Monster, you see scenes from Tezuka straight up, just kind of reimagined characters like Mr.

929
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,550
Speaker 1: Mustachios.

930
00:46:42,631 --> 00:46:43,056
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

931
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,484
Speaker 0: Daddy Walrus.

932
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:48,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, you see, it's like, you know, it's like all that kind of stuff.

933
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,480
Speaker 1: It's just Tezuka all over the place.

934
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:53,040
Speaker 1: The blackjack's coming in, everything's coming in.

935
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:54,780
Speaker 0: But that's not the interesting thing about Monster.

936
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:58,300
Speaker 0: I mean, that in and of itself, that setup would make for a great manga series.

937
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:04,440
Speaker 0: But basically what Ursa does with Monster is pull a Hitchcock.

938
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:06,540
Speaker 1: It's a total Hitchcock.

939
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:15,760
Speaker 0: Well, I guess we'll have to spoil the first volume to spoil Psycho, because I hope you have all seen Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.

940
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:35,620
Speaker 0: But in Psycho, the story starts, if you recall, as a woman who has robbed all this money and she's on the run on the car, she stops at this motel and it starts off like it's going to be this kind of robber money mystery kind of thing.

941
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:41,520
Speaker 0: The police are after her and she stopped at this hotel and this nice man gives her room and she goes into the room.

942
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,599
Speaker 0: And you're expecting this one kind of movie.

943
00:47:44,343 --> 00:47:46,840
Speaker 0: And then the stabbings happen and it's a completely different movie.

944
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,779
Speaker 0: Monster is the exact same thing.

945
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:59,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like I expected reading Monster for it to be the same hospital drama story, you know, from beginning to end, you know, because it started off as like a hospital drama kind of thing.

946
00:47:59,883 --> 00:48:01,980
Speaker 1: And the doctor is his main character.

947
00:48:02,442 --> 00:48:06,760
Speaker 1: So it's going to be that awesome manga hospital drama.

948
00:48:07,124 --> 00:48:08,458
Speaker 1: And that's what Monster is.

949
00:48:08,801 --> 00:48:13,380
Speaker 0: But no, the story is, you know, it sets up that that kind of moral dilemma.

950
00:48:13,941 --> 00:48:21,300
Speaker 0: And later, Tenma, the doctor, he comes out of a surgery and he sees the wife of the Turkish person he didn't operate on.

951
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:23,560
Speaker 0: And he died and she's crying.

952
00:48:23,782 --> 00:48:25,860
Speaker 0: And he's really bothered by this.

953
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,760
Speaker 0: And you can see this kind of plot fomenting.

954
00:48:27,861 --> 00:48:31,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, because he realized that if he had operated on the Turkish guy, he would have lived.

955
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,119
Speaker 1: And that's who he was scheduled to operate on.

956
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:35,400
Speaker 0: And the Turkish guy, he saved the mayor instead.

957
00:48:36,002 --> 00:48:36,285
Speaker 1: Yeah.

958
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:37,640
Speaker 1: And the Turkish guy came in first.

959
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,680
Speaker 0: He's kind of disillusioned, but everyone's kind of telling him, oh, don't worry about it.

960
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:41,630
Speaker 0: That's the way the world is.

961
00:48:41,651 --> 00:48:42,298
Speaker 0: Just deal with it.

962
00:48:43,063 --> 00:48:44,940
Speaker 0: And then the same thing happens again.

963
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:50,520
Speaker 0: But this time there's a there's a crazy murder, suicide, like something happens at this mansion.

964
00:48:51,301 --> 00:48:54,780
Speaker 0: And a young boy is found shot through the head, but still breathing.

965
00:48:55,382 --> 00:48:58,820
Speaker 0: And a young girl is found comatose and everyone else in the family is dead.

966
00:48:59,641 --> 00:49:07,540
Speaker 1: So he immediately, you know, he's basically their siblings and their their children of two important people who escaped from East Germany.

967
00:49:07,863 --> 00:49:08,960
Speaker 0: But they don't even know that right away.

968
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:14,540
Speaker 0: All Tenma knows is that this boy was shot in the head, but he's alive and he thinks he can save him.

969
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:15,448
Speaker 1: Mm hmm.

970
00:49:15,469 --> 00:49:15,980
Speaker 0: So he does.

971
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:17,000
Speaker 0: He's about to operate.

972
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:21,720
Speaker 1: Then a very important political person comes in and he needs to operate on him instead.

973
00:49:22,142 --> 00:49:24,319
Speaker 0: And Tenma is, you know, he's going to go along with it.

974
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:29,220
Speaker 0: But then he he has this kind of internal crisis and he decides, no, I'm doing the right thing.

975
00:49:29,322 --> 00:49:30,299
Speaker 0: I'm going to save this boy.

976
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:31,698
Speaker 0: Damn the consequences.

977
00:49:32,542 --> 00:49:33,168
Speaker 0: And he does.

978
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,620
Speaker 0: He saves this boy's life.

979
00:49:34,901 --> 00:49:40,740
Speaker 0: The political figure dies and he is now persona non gratis with everyone in the hospital.

980
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:47,100
Speaker 0: Basically now his his, you know, fiance, the daughter of the hospital, leaves of the director of the hospital, leaves him.

981
00:49:47,481 --> 00:49:48,720
Speaker 0: The director passes him over.

982
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,220
Speaker 0: He's no longer the head of neurosurgery.

983
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,300
Speaker 1: He doesn't get any promotions.

984
00:49:51,462 --> 00:49:51,705
Speaker 1: He does.

985
00:49:51,726 --> 00:49:52,820
Speaker 1: He gets basically to stick.

986
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:53,847
Speaker 1: They work him to death.

987
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:55,440
Speaker 1: They give him like the worst hours.

988
00:49:55,841 --> 00:50:00,600
Speaker 1: He has to work like all day and all night doing like the lowest end level surgeries.

989
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,980
Speaker 0: Some other doctor now is dating his fiance.

990
00:50:03,543 --> 00:50:07,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, he basically gets the complete total shaft.

991
00:50:07,881 --> 00:50:13,360
Speaker 1: And now he's hanging out with the other surgeon who's like, yeah, I got the shaft to welcome to my world.

992
00:50:13,742 --> 00:50:14,406
Speaker 1: So I like that guy.

993
00:50:14,427 --> 00:50:16,400
Speaker 1: That's like one of my favorite characters, that other doctor.

994
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:17,124
Speaker 0: I like him, too.

995
00:50:17,185 --> 00:50:19,059
Speaker 0: He's what we'll talk about.

996
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,263
Speaker 0: Why is so great?

997
00:50:20,303 --> 00:50:25,740
Speaker 0: because but suffice it to say his side characters are brilliant.

998
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:31,199
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, what he does all throughout Monster, right, is pretty much every volume or two.

999
00:50:31,622 --> 00:50:33,900
Speaker 1: He brings in these brand new characters, right?

1000
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:34,879
Speaker 1: It's like brand new.

1001
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:40,700
Speaker 1: And usually when someone brings in a brand new character, multi volumes in, you're like, who the fuck is this?

1002
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,980
Speaker 1: You know, you just want to see the characters you already love and see what happens to them.

1003
00:50:45,021 --> 00:50:46,339
Speaker 0: Of course, a lot of people bring it.

1004
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,740
Speaker 0: Well, remember, Trigun, you didn't give a shit about Brado at the beginning.

1005
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:50,403
Speaker 0: Exactly.

1006
00:50:50,625 --> 00:50:52,077
Speaker 1: You were crying your eyes out by the end.

1007
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,600
Speaker 1: Brado master.

1008
00:50:53,700 --> 00:51:01,000
Speaker 1: He brings in Brado's like every fucking volume and then within 10 pages, you care about them just as much as you care about.

1009
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,242
Speaker 1: Tenma.

1010
00:51:02,583 --> 00:51:07,000
Speaker 1: So he basically keeps adding more people to care about with occasional deaths, of course.

1011
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:14,420
Speaker 0: But what happens with Monster is that he's kind of his life is falling apart and he's in the room with this boy who he saved.

1012
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:19,620
Speaker 0: And he basically says to the boy, you know, I gave up everything to say the boy's comatose.

1013
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:26,580
Speaker 1: He's sort of just talking to himself and he's, you know, sort of having this soliloquy in the room of, you know, the comatose boy.

1014
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:27,343
Speaker 0: But he's at peace.

1015
00:51:27,624 --> 00:51:30,900
Speaker 0: He's given he's lost everything, but he feels like he did the right thing.

1016
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:32,062
Speaker 0: He saved this boy's life.

1017
00:51:32,463 --> 00:51:42,740
Speaker 0: But at the same time, he you know, he wishes that this hadn't happened and that all the people who had wronged him were dead or not around or just, you know, the anger of someone who has been wronged unduly.

1018
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:52,480
Speaker 0: All of those people, well, not all of those people, but many of the people die mysteriously and one thing leads to another.

1019
00:51:52,561 --> 00:51:54,540
Speaker 0: And then the boy and the girl disappear.

1020
00:51:55,521 --> 00:51:59,540
Speaker 0: And I'm obviously I'm being vague here because this is where it all takes off.

1021
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:17,500
Speaker 0: But the story goes in a direction so unlike where it began and so out there and just so beyond what you would have expected from this disappearance monster is just this powerful psychological thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat at every single freaking panel all the way until the end.

1022
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:18,642
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

1023
00:52:18,882 --> 00:52:29,320
Speaker 1: And just constantly like I said, you're lighting the pages on fire, you know, and obviously, you know, it goes away from the hospital, but Tenma is occasionally forced to blackjack it up here and there.

1024
00:52:29,542 --> 00:52:31,600
Speaker 0: Tenma is just blackjack plus Master Keaton.

1025
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:36,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty much he's better Keaton with the blackjack skills instead of the fighting skills.

1026
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,280
Speaker 1: But actually, at one point, he goes to fighting school and learns the fighting skills.

1027
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,258
Speaker 0: That's actually pretty good.

1028
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,939
Speaker 0: He starts looking more and more like Master Keaton, too.

1029
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:50,020
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, you know, Urasawa sort of does that thing where, you know, his main characters all look very similar.

1030
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,400
Speaker 1: They're all look like Master Keaton.

1031
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, let me look at sanctuary.

1032
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:53,637
Speaker 1: You see the same thing.

1033
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:57,419
Speaker 1: Like the guy in 20th Century Boys looks a little bit like he's a little different, but he's, you know.

1034
00:52:58,141 --> 00:53:01,340
Speaker 0: Well, plus there's the friend in both of them, right?

1035
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:01,661
Speaker 1: Right.

1036
00:53:01,981 --> 00:53:08,740
Speaker 1: So, you know, but yeah, it's like all, you know, Tenma goes on this journey, basically, of awesomeness and epicness.

1037
00:53:09,322 --> 00:53:12,460
Speaker 1: And you're not always following him directly, though.

1038
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:21,560
Speaker 1: You know, sometimes you're sort of floating near him, like, you know, you'll be like following some other characters and like Tenma will walk by and it's like, oh, shit, oh, shit.

1039
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:22,402
Speaker 1: Oh, shit.

1040
00:53:22,965 --> 00:53:26,680
Speaker 0: Pretty much the way I will tell this to you is that, you know, all this happens.

1041
00:53:27,043 --> 00:53:29,140
Speaker 0: The boy and the sister disappear and a bunch of people die.

1042
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:36,880
Speaker 0: Fast forward many, many years later, like it skips a big period of time and then the plot begins.

1043
00:53:37,161 --> 00:53:37,422
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1044
00:53:37,623 --> 00:53:41,440
Speaker 0: So the kind of the entire whole first set up is just the preface.

1045
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:46,340
Speaker 0: It's like here is what happened in the past and now our feature presentation.

1046
00:53:47,782 --> 00:53:50,720
Speaker 1: But and that that what happened in the past is volume one.

1047
00:53:50,821 --> 00:53:53,540
Speaker 1: So it's 17 volumes of feature presentation.

1048
00:53:54,042 --> 00:53:54,263
Speaker 0: Yes.

1049
00:53:54,524 --> 00:53:58,060
Speaker 0: And the quote from the beginning of the manga actually really sums it up best.

1050
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:02,859
Speaker 0: You may recognize what it is from, but this might give you an idea of where this is going.

1051
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:10,560
Speaker 0: And I saw the beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and 10 horns and upon his horns, 10 crowns and upon his heads, the names of blasphemy.

1052
00:54:11,202 --> 00:54:13,400
Speaker 0: And they worshiped the dragon, which gave power unto the beast.

1053
00:54:13,842 --> 00:54:16,219
Speaker 0: And they worshiped the beast, saying, who is like unto the beast?

1054
00:54:16,603 --> 00:54:18,018
Speaker 0: Who is able to make war with him?

1055
00:54:19,062 --> 00:54:20,020
Speaker 0: That's our revelations.

1056
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what does it say on the back?

1057
00:54:23,521 --> 00:54:24,679
Speaker 1: Yeah, the first volume over there.

1058
00:54:25,201 --> 00:54:29,620
Speaker 0: No, because we can read the text on the back, actually, because I've been reading this so quickly.

1059
00:54:30,523 --> 00:54:32,879
Speaker 0: I have like four volumes of Monster in my car.

1060
00:54:33,241 --> 00:54:37,620
Speaker 0: I have another three in my desk at work because I'm just carrying them around and reading them everywhere.

1061
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:41,740
Speaker 0: I have to make sure I have enough with me to get through a train ride.

1062
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:42,122
Speaker 0: I'm going to be.

1063
00:54:42,484 --> 00:54:45,279
Speaker 0: you realize I am like three volumes away from the end at this point.

1064
00:54:45,881 --> 00:54:46,122
Speaker 1: Wow.

1065
00:54:46,685 --> 00:54:49,819
Speaker 1: Well, so on Amazon.com, actually, I checked right now.

1066
00:54:50,321 --> 00:54:53,160
Speaker 1: There's actually no discount on Monster whatsoever.

1067
00:54:53,281 --> 00:54:57,120
Speaker 1: So it would cost you about one hundred and eighty dollars to get all of it.

1068
00:54:57,442 --> 00:54:57,967
Speaker 0: And you know what?

1069
00:54:58,572 --> 00:54:59,500
Speaker 0: It's definitely worth.

1070
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:07,600
Speaker 1: Well, what I'm going to tell you to do is I'm looking at some other websites to try to find a lower price right now.

1071
00:55:09,284 --> 00:55:10,920
Speaker 1: I guess I can't find a lower price.

1072
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:16,740
Speaker 1: I bought them from in stock trades dot com, but apparently I bought all of them and they're no longer in stock.

1073
00:55:17,423 --> 00:55:19,239
Speaker 1: So you get I got a discount over there.

1074
00:55:20,001 --> 00:55:21,350
Speaker 0: So I guess I would.

1075
00:55:21,591 --> 00:55:23,000
Speaker 0: this is one of those things where I would.

1076
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:27,000
Speaker 1: Maybe try to buy, you know, used on Amazon, try to find it at a convention.

1077
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:29,060
Speaker 0: Try to mention is probably your best bet.

1078
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:31,600
Speaker 0: We'll find one of those, you know, buy four, get five.

1079
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:32,421
Speaker 1: This isn't.

1080
00:55:32,441 --> 00:55:37,200
Speaker 1: this isn't something that's going to be hard to find, you know, because it was you know, it's a recent vis release.

1081
00:55:37,382 --> 00:55:39,160
Speaker 1: The last volume came out December.

1082
00:55:39,362 --> 00:55:39,524
Speaker 1: Right.

1083
00:55:39,564 --> 00:55:39,706
Speaker 1: What?

1084
00:55:39,988 --> 00:55:41,120
Speaker 1: Like just a few months ago.

1085
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:41,561
Speaker 1: Right.

1086
00:55:42,003 --> 00:55:46,780
Speaker 1: So you can definitely find this at a convention or, you know, borders or whatever.

1087
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:52,940
Speaker 1: Just, you know, do something that you discount because one hundred eighty dollars is a lot of monies and, you know, monies is tight.

1088
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:55,160
Speaker 1: I paid, you know, five bucks per volume.

1089
00:55:55,281 --> 00:55:57,019
Speaker 1: So there's no reason you should pay ten.

1090
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,740
Speaker 0: But at least this isn't going to be a sanctuary.

1091
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:03,700
Speaker 0: You're not going to have to like scrounge for years to find the one or two volumes you're missing or anything.

1092
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:10,540
Speaker 1: No, I mean, the only thing you might have to worry about is if it gets stupid popular, there might not be enough of them out there already.

1093
00:56:10,822 --> 00:56:12,900
Speaker 0: You know, for everybody, of course, that might be good.

1094
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:14,800
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll get a reprint now.

1095
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:15,181
Speaker 1: Maybe.

1096
00:56:15,262 --> 00:56:16,246
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1097
00:56:16,266 --> 00:56:19,240
Speaker 1: Plus, you know, I'm pretty sure like number 18 is like still in print.

1098
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:19,522
Speaker 1: Right.

1099
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:22,260
Speaker 1: You know, at least some many of them are priced still in print.

1100
00:56:22,561 --> 00:56:24,930
Speaker 0: But what makes Monster Urusawa stuff.

1101
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:27,600
Speaker 0: good primarily is just that his faces are great.

1102
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:37,740
Speaker 0: Like he, while he uses this kind of cast of characters approach that Tezuka used and other people use, all of his side character, like every character is so absolutely distinctive and so unique.

1103
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:38,642
Speaker 1: And it's like he's.

1104
00:56:38,842 --> 00:56:45,620
Speaker 1: the faces have a little bit of the stereotypical anime look like some people got a pointy chin or a big eye kind of thing.

1105
00:56:45,761 --> 00:56:46,042
Speaker 1: Right.

1106
00:56:46,424 --> 00:56:49,760
Speaker 1: But like they have like these really human faces.

1107
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:50,802
Speaker 1: Most of the characters.

1108
00:56:50,822 --> 00:57:00,900
Speaker 1: And you can always recognize people, you know, it's like and a lot of them are like really unique, like not everyone is like, you know, a freakin like, you know, a teenager or college student.

1109
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:14,920
Speaker 1: You know, he's got lots of like old people and like old ladies and old dudes and sort of weird looking people, tall, skinny people, short, fat people, even a completely throwaway, you know, bartender at a bar who has two lines in two panels.

1110
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:18,779
Speaker 0: And that's it will have character and be unique from any other bartender you see.

1111
00:57:19,201 --> 00:57:19,401
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1112
00:57:19,421 --> 00:57:26,220
Speaker 1: And it's like there's lots of characters that are like their side characters and they'll make you care about them a little bit.

1113
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:33,500
Speaker 1: They're sort of like on the third or fourth tier down from the main characters, you know, but he'll still draw them like all recognizably.

1114
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:38,780
Speaker 1: Like there are characters that are like only in the last volume, but they you know, they're there and they mean something.

1115
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:39,281
Speaker 1: They're important.

1116
00:57:39,301 --> 00:57:45,940
Speaker 1: They take a part in the story and he'll give them you know, he'll design them like full on and they're totally unique and you remember them.

1117
00:57:46,041 --> 00:57:47,380
Speaker 1: And it's it's pretty awesome.

1118
00:57:47,761 --> 00:57:57,800
Speaker 0: Also, I think part of why he's able to pull out so much suspense is that there's this cinematic timing to the way he draws panels to where the panels are arranged and put together.

1119
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:01,820
Speaker 0: Just they draw your eye along like you're watching a movie in the comic.

1120
00:58:02,542 --> 00:58:06,620
Speaker 0: And I know a lot of good manga do that, but I think Urasawa is particularly good at it.

1121
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:11,100
Speaker 0: And especially looking at Pluto or stuff after this, he's just getting better.

1122
00:58:11,302 --> 00:58:13,019
Speaker 0: And I think he's got a long way to go.

1123
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:18,240
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, that's the key to comics right above all else, right?

1124
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:24,860
Speaker 1: The number one most important thing in comic art is the control of time, right?

1125
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:29,680
Speaker 1: Because in a movie or if you're making a movie, you don't really control time, right?

1126
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:35,660
Speaker 1: I mean, you can have more frames per second, but people are watching action at a rate of one second per second.

1127
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:36,121
Speaker 1: Right.

1128
00:58:36,502 --> 00:58:45,099
Speaker 1: So, you know, you can make it sort of seem long and drawn out by like, you know, having someone watch like, you know, an empty room for a minute or two and they'll get kind of bored.

1129
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:49,740
Speaker 1: But in a comic, right, a person is turning the pages.

1130
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:50,562
Speaker 1: Right.

1131
00:58:51,044 --> 00:58:54,940
Speaker 1: And you might want them to turn the pages real quick in one part and slow in another part.

1132
00:58:55,441 --> 00:59:06,080
Speaker 1: And you have to with your art, with the way you lay out the panels, with the way you move the eye around, with how many words, whenever you put a lot of words in one place, someone's going to be stuck there for a while.

1133
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:14,140
Speaker 0: When you put no words or even if you don't, I think his brilliance is that I'll be like, I want to read it so fast because I'm desperately trying to see what's going to happen.

1134
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:18,380
Speaker 0: But at the same time, you'll kind of read, you'll look at panels.

1135
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:23,140
Speaker 0: There'll be a bunch of panels in a row and you'll kind of pause on one or two at the appropriate moment.

1136
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:32,960
Speaker 0: He draws you into this rhythm of reading to where even though, you know, you get to the panel and you know, on the next page, there's going to be the big reveal, but you don't turn the page right away.

1137
00:59:33,041 --> 00:59:35,060
Speaker 0: You kind of build up your own anticipation.

1138
00:59:35,401 --> 00:59:41,360
Speaker 0: And I think he subconsciously causes you to do that just by the way he arranges panels and what he's showing you.

1139
00:59:41,541 --> 00:59:43,119
Speaker 1: Well, that's that's what comics are.

1140
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:48,520
Speaker 1: You know, all good comics, you know, he also definitely this is an urasawa thing.

1141
00:59:48,901 --> 00:59:53,540
Speaker 0: He loves to have one party in a conversation, not be known.

1142
00:59:53,961 --> 00:59:55,628
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that's always.

1143
00:59:55,648 --> 00:59:58,680
Speaker 0: you always get the over the shoulder view, a little bit of the hair.

1144
00:59:59,061 --> 01:00:05,000
Speaker 0: And then the last panel before, like the title, like every chapter, you know, turn around and show you the other view.

1145
01:00:05,482 --> 01:00:09,000
Speaker 1: You do the 180 and you'll see the person who was on the other side of the conversation.

1146
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:16,660
Speaker 0: It's like every volume will begin with this kind of preface where it's always two characters having a conversation and you don't know who the second one is.

1147
01:00:17,001 --> 01:00:23,820
Speaker 0: And then the last panel that the last page that has the title of that volume will then show you who the person was talking to.

1148
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:37,080
Speaker 1: And it's always like also sometimes what he'll do is if if there's a character by themselves, it'll either give you what they're saying or what to themselves or what they're thinking or some sort of narration as the character is performing some actions.

1149
01:00:37,641 --> 01:00:51,760
Speaker 1: And then once that, you know, it's sort of coming to a head that he'll draw and reveal, like the secret thing about what the character was doing, you know, like, oh, snap, you know, like someone will be looking for something and, you know, like maybe trying to find a secret.

1150
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:58,780
Speaker 1: And then he'll you'll turn the page, Bani hits you with the secret, just as if he was, you know, showing you the other character in a conversation.

1151
01:00:58,943 --> 01:00:59,699
Speaker 1: Same technique.

1152
01:01:00,341 --> 01:01:06,380
Speaker 0: Plus, I got to say, well, the side characters are great, but I like all the main characters except Detective Sook.

1153
01:01:07,108 --> 01:01:08,039
Speaker 1: Except Detective Sook.

1154
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:09,599
Speaker 0: He's just kind of lame.

1155
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,387
Speaker 1: My favorite guys are.

1156
01:01:11,468 --> 01:01:13,819
Speaker 1: well, number one, my favorite guy is lunch.

1157
01:01:14,322 --> 01:01:14,707
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1158
01:01:14,869 --> 01:01:15,619
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

1159
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:22,180
Speaker 1: He is just the thing with lunch is like he starts out one way and then he sort of gets crazy for a while.

1160
01:01:22,801 --> 01:01:27,540
Speaker 1: And then, you know, what they do with him is like totally not what you would expect that character to do.

1161
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:33,640
Speaker 0: It's hard to tell what he's doing because you can't get into his head more so than on purpose.

1162
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:34,064
Speaker 1: They don't.

1163
01:01:34,084 --> 01:01:35,218
Speaker 1: He doesn't bring you into his head.

1164
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:43,300
Speaker 0: But it's interesting because the whole time you're wondering, there are a couple of times where I thought he was on one side and then he just does the exact opposite of what I expect.

1165
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:43,781
Speaker 1: And he's like.

1166
01:01:43,821 --> 01:01:48,278
Speaker 1: he's just, you know, they betray him as such like this fucked up, hard to understand guy.

1167
01:01:48,901 --> 01:01:50,468
Speaker 1: You know, it's like, you know, it's like.

1168
01:01:50,549 --> 01:01:52,920
Speaker 1: it's like kids and wife leave him and whatever.

1169
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:58,580
Speaker 1: And it's like, you know, and he just sort of doesn't have any sort of emotional reaction whatsoever.

1170
01:01:59,561 --> 01:02:03,920
Speaker 1: And you can't figure out like, you know, well, is he upset and hiding it or does he not care?

1171
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:04,483
Speaker 1: You don't know.

1172
01:02:04,724 --> 01:02:05,307
Speaker 1: You can't tell.

1173
01:02:05,327 --> 01:02:07,840
Speaker 1: And he's a crazy dude.

1174
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:11,360
Speaker 1: And out the other doctor, I already said I like him a lot.

1175
01:02:11,521 --> 01:02:12,899
Speaker 1: I actually like the girl a lot.

1176
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:13,911
Speaker 0: Oh, she's bad.

1177
01:02:13,931 --> 01:02:14,620
Speaker 0: She's awesome.

1178
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:18,638
Speaker 0: This is I feel like he's better about this now, but at least in Monster and some.

1179
01:02:19,642 --> 01:02:22,380
Speaker 0: He seems to have this kind of a few faces.

1180
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:23,304
Speaker 0: He draws women with.

1181
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:27,180
Speaker 0: women are either sad, evil or the main character.

1182
01:02:27,561 --> 01:02:31,660
Speaker 1: Well, no, see that there was the girl who is the untrained doctor.

1183
01:02:32,104 --> 01:02:33,219
Speaker 1: She was there for like a little bit.

1184
01:02:33,604 --> 01:02:34,170
Speaker 0: She's awesome.

1185
01:02:34,211 --> 01:02:34,980
Speaker 0: I didn't see much of her.

1186
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:35,661
Speaker 1: Yeah, she's not.

1187
01:02:35,721 --> 01:02:36,222
Speaker 1: she's not like.

1188
01:02:36,322 --> 01:02:36,623
Speaker 1: she's like.

1189
01:02:37,024 --> 01:02:44,140
Speaker 1: it's weird because like he actually bothers to develop her character a little bit and like gives her a whole chapter or two like to, you know, talk about her and whatever.

1190
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:48,411
Speaker 1: But like and I think she's in it for like a couple more panels and like.

1191
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:51,280
Speaker 1: she's not there that much and she doesn't matter that much.

1192
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:55,140
Speaker 1: But he puts her in there, you know, and it's that sort of character.

1193
01:02:55,220 --> 01:03:02,400
Speaker 1: It's like you bother to make a character, you fill them with so much life and then they don't get a lot of screen time.

1194
01:03:02,481 --> 01:03:04,239
Speaker 1: And you just have so many of those.

1195
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:05,021
Speaker 1: Right.

1196
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:11,480
Speaker 1: This quantity of really strong, you know, life filled characters just all over the place.

1197
01:03:11,702 --> 01:03:13,560
Speaker 1: It's like a menagerie of characters.

1198
01:03:13,923 --> 01:03:14,548
Speaker 1: It's like a zoo.

1199
01:03:14,568 --> 01:03:15,939
Speaker 1: It's pretty cool.

1200
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:17,141
Speaker 1: I like it.

1201
01:03:17,763 --> 01:03:22,680
Speaker 0: I don't really want to say too much more because you've really got to do some final thoughts when you're done.

1202
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,320
Speaker 0: You have all got to read Monster.

1203
01:03:24,541 --> 01:03:26,440
Speaker 0: This is an amazing manga.

1204
01:03:28,882 --> 01:03:30,620
Speaker 1: I was going to say it would be monstrous.

1205
01:03:38,876 --> 01:03:40,960
