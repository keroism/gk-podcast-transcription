1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,854
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday May 10th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:12,894 --> 00:00:14,620
Speaker 0: We talk about free comic book day.

3
00:00:16,161 --> 00:00:17,216
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:22,980
Speaker 1: Apparently talking about all of e3 in one episode was more than rim could handle.

5
00:00:23,822 --> 00:00:25,888
Speaker 0: Yeah, we also had technical limitations.

6
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:29,900
Speaker 0: not really lipson doesn't like you uploading more than 50 megabyte file.

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,505
Speaker 1: It wouldn't have been 50 megabyte.

8
00:00:31,686 --> 00:00:34,596
Speaker 0: It was 45 as it was all right.

9
00:00:34,636 --> 00:00:35,820
Speaker 1: all right anyway.

10
00:00:38,158 --> 00:00:49,276
Speaker 1: The Point is that Tomorrow we're going to complete our we coverage by I mean our e3 coverage by talking about the we and the Xbox and the other stuff.

11
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:50,339
Speaker 1: Microsoft had to say yeah

12
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,940
Speaker 0: Pretty much just the rest of Nintendo and Microsoft

13
00:00:53,121 --> 00:01:06,286
Speaker 1: And I guess that's a good thing actually because a lot of stuff happened with the Wii and Microsoft today Information that was available on the show floor that was not available at the press conferences But Sony not.

14
00:01:06,346 --> 00:01:08,752
Speaker 1: so much new news of the show floor.

15
00:01:08,832 --> 00:01:18,209
Speaker 0: the best news that came out since Sony did their thing is That someone said that the controller They demoed wasn't as shitty as other people had said.

16
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:28,300
Speaker 1: it was well because people said it was shitty based on what they saw at The press conference, but upon actual use the accelerometers in the PlayStation 3 controller actually worked pretty well.

17
00:01:28,882 --> 00:01:31,672
Speaker 0: I still think it's a terrible idea, but that's beside the point.

18
00:01:31,974 --> 00:01:32,776
Speaker 0: It's a terrible idea.

19
00:01:32,817 --> 00:01:42,240
Speaker 1: That's well executed Yep, but that's the only News from Sony so we don't have to go back and update that but we are going to complete the e3 coverage tomorrow.

20
00:01:42,822 --> 00:01:44,869
Speaker 1: Today we're gonna talk about all the comics.

21
00:01:44,889 --> 00:01:45,993
Speaker 1: We got our free comic book day.

22
00:01:46,454 --> 00:01:49,773
Speaker 0: Yeah, well they were mostly terrible But we'll get to that we will.

23
00:01:49,813 --> 00:01:50,579
Speaker 1: that's the main bit.

24
00:01:52,481 --> 00:01:53,548
Speaker 0: All right, let's get.

25
00:01:53,588 --> 00:01:54,453
Speaker 0: some news is out of the way.

26
00:01:54,715 --> 00:02:00,460
Speaker 1: some news is Well all those anime people will be disappointed, but I do have some anime news.

27
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:09,810
Speaker 1: So if you came to listen about anime and are disappointed because this comic books He's here one great in it of interesting information.

28
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:13,166
Speaker 1: Samu Tezuka is the god of manga.

29
00:02:13,327 --> 00:02:17,499
Speaker 1: you know the Astro Boy guy who writes all the best manga ever.

30
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:18,725
Speaker 1: of course He's dead, but well.

31
00:02:18,745 --> 00:02:19,872
Speaker 0: He didn't write Death Note.

32
00:02:20,134 --> 00:02:26,279
Speaker 1: No he didn't write death Unless he came back from the dead as a zombie, and he's actually the secret writer of Death Note.

33
00:02:27,942 --> 00:02:32,180
Speaker 0: You know I would put that as a non-zero probability except for the fact that Misa Misa exists.

34
00:02:32,581 --> 00:02:34,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, he definitely would not write a Misa Misa.

35
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,896
Speaker 0: Oh he would but she would be different.

36
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:45,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway Apparently there were five of his manga not like full manga, but just you know comic works.

37
00:02:46,164 --> 00:02:56,098
Speaker 1: They weren't very long that were Recently discovered as in they were lost, but no one realized they were missing, but now they're like oh Here are some.

38
00:02:56,902 --> 00:03:03,179
Speaker 1: What happened was there was a US censorship unit from World War two and that censorship unit had gathered some?

39
00:03:04,202 --> 00:03:12,355
Speaker 1: ossamu tezuka mangas and Apparently every other copy of these mangas in the world was destroyed if there were any other copies at all.

40
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:30,020
Speaker 1: and Someone who is looking through the Gordon W Prang collection at the University of Maryland Found some ossamu tezuka works and was like oh Newly discovered manga super awesome, and it is super awesome.

41
00:03:30,942 --> 00:03:33,180
Speaker 0: Are there scans of it available, or is it gonna be published?

42
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,215
Speaker 1: I don't know.

43
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:40,460
Speaker 1: I think right now your best bet would be to go to the University of Maryland and go to the collection and check them out.

44
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,539
Speaker 0: You know that's not that far away.

45
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:44,169
Speaker 1: No, it's not really that we can.

46
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,220
Speaker 1: we can stop by there on our way to Otakon.

47
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,630
Speaker 1: Maybe we'll call them ahead of time or something you know.

48
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,020
Speaker 1: it's in Baltimore or near its north of Baltimore?

49
00:03:51,421 --> 00:03:54,271
Speaker 1: Very it's like barely north of Baltimore.

50
00:03:54,432 --> 00:03:59,668
Speaker 0: doesn't matter if I drove all that way to Baltimore I'm not gonna be against driving another.

51
00:03:59,808 --> 00:04:00,771
Speaker 0: you know 20 minutes.

52
00:04:01,092 --> 00:04:11,332
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's see there was a six-frame strip called Tamishi girl in which a Subordinate uses his wits to fend off his Lord's violence way to spoil it.

53
00:04:11,412 --> 00:04:22,720
Speaker 1: there was a four-frame strip titled Yari Kirimasen Which it translates to I can't take it features a mannequin that gets embarrassed when someone peeks up the skirt.

54
00:04:23,121 --> 00:04:26,736
Speaker 1: Yeah, a 16 page manga called Hans to kin.

55
00:04:26,776 --> 00:04:27,700
Speaker 1: no common, okay?

56
00:04:29,422 --> 00:04:33,599
Speaker 1: And it doesn't say anything about that other than that translates to Hans and golden hair.

57
00:04:34,961 --> 00:04:38,756
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I don't know what the other ones are a link to the article.

58
00:04:38,816 --> 00:04:39,679
Speaker 1: you can read it yourself.

59
00:04:41,063 --> 00:04:45,939
Speaker 0: But if that's way cool, uh-huh I decided the non anime news.

60
00:04:47,102 --> 00:04:56,637
Speaker 0: It's a little old too, but there wasn't any interesting news other than e3 news today And I really want to save all of that like the revelation that pit is going to be in Smash Brothers.

61
00:04:56,738 --> 00:05:07,664
Speaker 0: Oh my god I've been waiting for that forever, but Alright, so someone made a fan video to battlefield 2. now This is a common thing.

62
00:05:07,744 --> 00:05:11,280
Speaker 0: people make all these sorts of music videos or stories to various games.

63
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:17,103
Speaker 0: I remember seeing a particularly creepy one to cat girls from Final Fantasy 11.

64
00:05:17,103 --> 00:05:20,334
Speaker 0: God yeah, but I mean it's a cool thing.

65
00:05:20,355 --> 00:05:21,760
Speaker 1: things you see on YouTube every day.

66
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:25,051
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean people make them all the time, and they're not anything new.

67
00:05:25,332 --> 00:05:26,617
Speaker 0: the internet knows about them.

68
00:05:26,657 --> 00:05:27,340
Speaker 0: They're a done deal.

69
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:29,163
Speaker 0: Someone made one.

70
00:05:29,243 --> 00:05:30,066
Speaker 1: you know about them.

71
00:05:30,086 --> 00:05:31,811
Speaker 1: Yeah, they've been things of the day.

72
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:36,977
Speaker 0: often someone made one and It was somewhat anti-us.

73
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:38,543
Speaker 1: That's fine.

74
00:05:39,125 --> 00:06:01,160
Speaker 0: now the United States government and our wonderful intelligence agencies got a hold of this and thought hey It looks like the terrorists and al-qaeda and whatnot are making propaganda videos and distributing them to American youths via video games and the internet and To anyone on the internet who has half a clue.

75
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:10,573
Speaker 1: It's obvious that no some guy just made this video because he has a battlefield 2 playing, dude Made a funny video using footage from battlefield 2.

76
00:06:10,573 --> 00:06:12,260
Speaker 0: in fact his name is Sonic jihad.

77
00:06:13,662 --> 00:06:15,517
Speaker 1: That's a good screen name right there.

78
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:27,600
Speaker 0: now I just it amazes me that our government spends so much money on intelligence and Despite this they need to spend all this time and money tracking down propaganda.

79
00:06:28,324 --> 00:06:31,500
Speaker 0: That was actually just something some kid made in his spare time for fun.

80
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,525
Speaker 0: That was obvious to everyone in the world except them I'm telling you.

81
00:06:35,565 --> 00:06:36,169
Speaker 1: This is what it is.

82
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,900
Speaker 1: these people are so out of touch.

83
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:42,134
Speaker 1: That's why they have a crazy spy network because we know everything.

84
00:06:42,475 --> 00:06:43,799
Speaker 1: there's nothing you don't know.

85
00:06:44,747 --> 00:06:46,060
Speaker 1: You don't have to do anything to know it.

86
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:52,867
Speaker 1: But they are so out of touch that they can't know what we know because they don't know how to freakin use a computer And they know nothing about computers.

87
00:06:52,907 --> 00:06:54,353
Speaker 0: I'll know that there are things.

88
00:06:54,393 --> 00:06:55,839
Speaker 0: We don't know not much.

89
00:06:57,223 --> 00:07:04,740
Speaker 0: Okay, sorry Scott What sites exactly do say the AIDS virus bind to when they're trying to replicate?

90
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,591
Speaker 1: I can go look that up on the internet.

91
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:09,087
Speaker 0: all right Why do we get cancer?

92
00:07:09,107 --> 00:07:11,739
Speaker 1: I can go look that up on the internet - we don't know.

93
00:07:12,522 --> 00:07:13,245
Speaker 0: No one knows.

94
00:07:13,265 --> 00:07:15,252
Speaker 1: I can go look up some good answers.

95
00:07:15,392 --> 00:07:18,744
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you don't know I'll give you the same answer Some bio teacher gives.

96
00:07:18,784 --> 00:07:20,068
Speaker 1: I'll email them and get his answer.

97
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:22,497
Speaker 0: Yeah, the answer will be mostly we don't know.

98
00:07:22,517 --> 00:07:24,351
Speaker 1: that's fine That's the answer.

99
00:07:24,371 --> 00:07:25,100
Speaker 1: I'll get from the internet.

100
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,513
Speaker 1: Then the point is that that's why these people need a spy network.

101
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,480
Speaker 1: for what's normal for us.

102
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,770
Speaker 1: They need a spy network for that's how incompetent.

103
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:33,655
Speaker 1: They are well.

104
00:07:33,695 --> 00:07:34,780
Speaker 0: It's like the gaming industry.

105
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,784
Speaker 0: I mean the engage.

106
00:07:35,904 --> 00:07:40,320
Speaker 0: when it was announced by and large the internet said that's going to fail.

107
00:07:40,763 --> 00:07:43,400
Speaker 0: I'm a hundred percent sure that that product is going to fail.

108
00:07:43,741 --> 00:07:46,632
Speaker 0: It is obvious to me, and I will not even consider it further.

109
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:57,120
Speaker 0: side talking then Nokia seemed to be completely unaware of this and went forward all the way and then it failed and they couldn't imagine why and they lost millions.

110
00:07:58,101 --> 00:08:01,251
Speaker 1: I got four words that are gonna end this discussion right now.

111
00:08:01,692 --> 00:08:04,360
Speaker 1: that shows people being clueless about how the internet works.

112
00:08:05,481 --> 00:08:07,118
Speaker 1: snakes on a plane.

113
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,420
Speaker 0: See at first I thought snakes on a plane was gonna be there like a clue.

114
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:17,120
Speaker 0: Maybe it was a clever marketing scheme, but I really think they were clueless, and they don't really don't know why it's popular.

115
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:17,883
Speaker 1: They're really clueless.

116
00:08:18,505 --> 00:08:23,020
Speaker 0: I just it amazes me that people in power can be so clueless and yet still be in power.

117
00:08:23,483 --> 00:08:25,216
Speaker 0: Why don't they hire me to tell them?

118
00:08:25,256 --> 00:08:25,599
Speaker 0: What's up?

119
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could replace the entire NSA just all on your own.

120
00:08:31,481 --> 00:08:36,518
Speaker 0: No, I need at least five or six guys to sit in various cities and tell me if anything weird is going on.

121
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:37,996
Speaker 1: well They already have those guys.

122
00:08:38,783 --> 00:08:41,054
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they pay those guys a lot more than they need to pay me.

123
00:08:41,075 --> 00:08:44,659
Speaker 0: oh Well those guys don't know the internet like I do.

124
00:08:45,322 --> 00:08:47,529
Speaker 1: Well no they have a bunch of this room at the NSA.

125
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:52,584
Speaker 1: somewhere where all these people sit on computers is listening to Terrorist chatter.

126
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,177
Speaker 0: yeah, they probably listen to he talking to Emily in Japan on Skype.

127
00:08:56,518 --> 00:09:03,522
Speaker 0: Yeah Though actually I did see that the government is demanded to be able to wiretap Skype Whatever.

128
00:09:03,802 --> 00:09:07,514
Speaker 0: well they can go you can't encrypt on Skype.

129
00:09:07,754 --> 00:09:08,938
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll use something else.

130
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:16,480
Speaker 0: yeah I'm really waiting for someone to make a really ubiquitous good easy to use in PGP encrypted voice talk thing.

131
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:18,163
Speaker 1: We'll make it.

132
00:09:18,865 --> 00:09:19,869
Speaker 0: someone made it a long time ago.

133
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:21,114
Speaker 0: It's called called PGP phone.

134
00:09:21,174 --> 00:09:22,760
Speaker 0: It's just slow old and hard to find.

135
00:09:23,202 --> 00:09:36,999
Speaker 1: Yep, it also doesn't work, so well well We'll just add some PGP to gizmo or something and we'll be all set all right.

136
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:41,800
Speaker 0: that was quick Which is good because my thing of the day has been trying to jump out of my mouth for the past 10 minutes.

137
00:09:42,342 --> 00:09:44,291
Speaker 1: Well it's a crazy thing of the day now.

138
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:51,340
Speaker 0: anyone who follows my delicious priority saw it And it may be linked to from various places because it's it's quite hilarious.

139
00:09:52,043 --> 00:09:55,880
Speaker 1: But I really didn't expect what it was when I first saw it, and then I was like whoa.

140
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:05,904
Speaker 0: It's a video That some roommates took where they snuck into a guy's bedroom and caught him Masturbating.

141
00:10:05,924 --> 00:10:09,817
Speaker 1: oh, that's no big deal to World of Warcraft.

142
00:10:09,838 --> 00:10:09,918
Speaker 0: whoa.

143
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:24,213
Speaker 0: Some Dancer girl is dancing on the screen and he's typing something furiously while he's doing something else furiously and the camera guy slips in real quiet and Ahead of time like if you see on the camera like people like he's in there.

144
00:10:24,253 --> 00:10:24,957
Speaker 0: He's doing it right now.

145
00:10:25,037 --> 00:10:25,379
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

146
00:10:27,261 --> 00:10:33,080
Speaker 0: And then they slip in and you can tell the guy with the camera is just like on the verge of exploding.

147
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:41,719
Speaker 0: And then the guy is Masturbating and he turns around because he hears the guy walk.

148
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,500
Speaker 1: well No first the camera guy zooms in on the screen, and you see this dancing girl.

149
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:54,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got to see the dancing girl Yeah, and then the guy turns around and just the look on his face followed by the what the fuck what the fuck?

150
00:10:55,782 --> 00:10:58,539
Speaker 0: And then the camera guy just starts laughing and it's hilarious.

151
00:11:00,101 --> 00:11:01,688
Speaker 1: There's really not much more to say.

152
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:07,375
Speaker 1: don't worry you don't see any penises or anything but It's completely safe for work.

153
00:11:07,496 --> 00:11:17,309
Speaker 0: actually one if any of you out there if ever masturbated World of Warcraft because I Wouldn't be surprised if this was a not entirely uncommon phenomena.

154
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:19,174
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't I'm not surprised at all.

155
00:11:19,755 --> 00:11:21,420
Speaker 0: um oh my god.

156
00:11:21,883 --> 00:11:26,166
Speaker 1: Yeah, something's fucking wrong with you If you're masturbating to World of Warcraft.

157
00:11:26,507 --> 00:11:29,274
Speaker 1: that could be who knows what on the other end.

158
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:38,577
Speaker 0: now to his credit There's a slight chance that he has a wonderful girlfriend or boyfriend somewhere And they were merely engaging in some cyber play and World of Warcraft.

159
00:11:38,677 --> 00:11:39,200
Speaker 1: be a girlfriend.

160
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,448
Speaker 1: He was looking at a dancing girl.

161
00:11:40,468 --> 00:11:42,260
Speaker 0: I never know you never know.

162
00:11:43,522 --> 00:11:48,426
Speaker 1: He's gay, and he wants his gay partner The dancing girl.

163
00:11:48,446 --> 00:11:50,052
Speaker 0: the dancing girl could have just been there.

164
00:11:50,112 --> 00:11:51,276
Speaker 0: it could have been all in the text.

165
00:11:51,537 --> 00:11:52,059
Speaker 1: it could have been.

166
00:11:52,521 --> 00:12:01,575
Speaker 0: However, I'll note that when you see the guy's reaction, and you see what the guy looks like one He looks like the kind of guy you'd catch doing this sort of thing.

167
00:12:01,857 --> 00:12:09,380
Speaker 0: mm-hmm We've known people like that mmm And - I don't think he has a girlfriend or a boyfriend.

168
00:12:10,402 --> 00:12:11,325
Speaker 1: I don't think so either.

169
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:20,392
Speaker 0: so if you needed any other reason to not play World of Warcraft this video is it Because people like that are playing it with you.

170
00:12:20,553 --> 00:12:21,699
Speaker 1: Do you really want to play with them?

171
00:12:23,381 --> 00:12:26,311
Speaker 1: Or you might be thought of as one of those people in fact.

172
00:12:26,773 --> 00:12:28,820
Speaker 1: I probably think of you as one of those people.

173
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:36,829
Speaker 1: So that's if you care what I think about you, which you shouldn't Because you shouldn't care what anyone thinks about you.

174
00:12:36,969 --> 00:12:39,679
Speaker 0: well you really shouldn't care what Scott thinks about you because he probably hates you.

175
00:12:40,147 --> 00:12:43,184
Speaker 1: I hate it Really hate people.

176
00:12:43,224 --> 00:12:44,088
Speaker 1: I just think they suck.

177
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:45,935
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're not like Dave who hates people.

00:12:45,995 --> 00:12:47,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just think people suck.

179
00:12:47,281 --> 00:12:50,178
Speaker 0: Yeah, we got this friend Dave who hates everyone, but it's real straightforward about it.

180
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:51,864
Speaker 1: Yeah I feel like I hate you.

181
00:12:52,065 --> 00:12:52,988

186
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:01,312
Speaker 1: It's a whole lot better.

187
00:13:01,452 --> 00:13:02,216

198
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:40,660
Speaker 1: You know he can go to a club and dance and you wouldn't be like oh that guy can't dance.

199
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,743
Speaker 1: He'd be like oh he can dance.

Speaker 0: No.

201
00:13:43,028 --> 00:13:45,997

Speaker 1: as long as it feels good everyone else gets the double deuce.

211
00:14:17,243 --> 00:14:26,917
Speaker 0: I should find some of those pictures of some of the dance parties We used to have at our IT because you feel all cool You know in the dark room, but you look like a dumbass especially when someone takes a picture with the flash.

212
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:31,119
Speaker 0: Oh god Yeah, yeah outside of the darkness that guy with the glow sticks not so much.

213
00:14:31,461 --> 00:14:32,525
Speaker 1: That's the thing about dancing.

214
00:14:32,565 --> 00:14:36,660
Speaker 1: is that any still frame of the dance looks completely stupid, but the video is alright.

215
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,236
Speaker 1: Yeah, dance is all about motion.

216
00:14:38,357 --> 00:14:39,744
Speaker 1: anyway It's a video.

217
00:14:39,784 --> 00:14:42,434
Speaker 1: this stand-up comedian dancing and what he does?

218
00:14:42,494 --> 00:14:44,100

219
00:14:44,160 --> 00:15:00,295
Speaker 1: he starts with Elvis in the 50s and Moves to the twist and he gets into some disco action, you know, he does a whole bunch of you know hit songs Threw out from the 50s to today and he does the dances to them.

220
00:15:00,737 --> 00:15:01,619
Speaker 1: I think the best ones.

221
00:15:02,761 --> 00:15:04,427
Speaker 0: Let's see to me the Michael Jackson.

222
00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:06,033
Speaker 1: Michael Jackson was good.

223
00:15:06,274 --> 00:15:07,800
Speaker 1: The MC Hammer was real good.

224
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,594
Speaker 1: Yeah, he did that thing the thing that hammer does.

225
00:15:10,614 --> 00:15:18,367
Speaker 1: Yeah The the Roboto followed by the breakdancing was good, man I can't do the robot at all.

226
00:15:18,849 --> 00:15:23,304
Speaker 1: I can kind of do the robot, but I can't do the breakdance Worm thing that he did.

227
00:15:23,906 --> 00:15:28,800
Speaker 0: I know a guy he works at IBM who got drunk and tried to do that almost broke his nose.

228
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:30,850
Speaker 0: Oh, basically, he just he stood there.

229
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,117
Speaker 0: He's like, hey, I'm gonna do the worm.

230
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:32,680
Speaker 0: What?

231
00:15:34,261 --> 00:15:37,996
Speaker 1: He did do the get knocked down and some of the dances he does aren't really dances.

232
00:15:38,036 --> 00:15:39,040
Speaker 1: They're just stupid jokes.

233
00:15:39,445 --> 00:15:40,538
Speaker 0: Yeah, he makes fun of the Macarena.

234
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:46,367
Speaker 1: Yeah Like when he cuz I knew as soon as this started and I realized what it was I was like is he gonna do the Macarena?

235
00:15:46,668 --> 00:15:50,462
Speaker 1: and then it came to the Macarena and he just gave the finger to the cat To the audience.

236
00:15:50,502 --> 00:15:52,668
Speaker 0: There's a tidbit when I was in middle school, right?

237
00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:54,694
Speaker 0: It was a long fuck time ago.

238
00:15:55,175 --> 00:16:01,215
Speaker 0: God, I feel old and We'd have we do science Olympiad and that's a really nerdy activity.

239
00:16:01,817 --> 00:16:07,200
Speaker 0: and then we'd have the big You know regional tournament and it was a huge region in our state where we did this.

240
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:16,020
Speaker 0: so there would be like five or six hundred kids and they put us in a big gym and they'd have a dance before the award ceremony and It was all nerds who can't dance at all.

241
00:16:16,201 --> 00:16:19,735
Speaker 0: So it was mostly kids milling around talking about computers while music played.

242
00:16:19,755 --> 00:16:23,231
Speaker 1: I noticed wait I want is what the guy left out the electric slide.

243
00:16:23,251 --> 00:16:23,935
Speaker 1: I was disappointed.

244
00:16:24,136 --> 00:16:35,069
Speaker 0: Ah, I didn't even notice The electric slide But I remember they started trying to get everywhere together.

245
00:16:35,109 --> 00:16:37,777
Speaker 0: they teach us dances like this is the hustle?

246
00:16:37,817 --> 00:16:39,105
Speaker 0: this is you know whatever?

247
00:16:39,126 --> 00:16:43,173
Speaker 0: and Then they decided to teach everyone the Spanish hustle.

248
00:16:43,213 --> 00:16:49,880
Speaker 0: they called it and it was the Macarena Before it was popular and they just had this song and we learned this thing and it was kind of stupid.

249
00:16:50,422 --> 00:16:52,753
Speaker 0: And then years later this Macarena thing appeared.

250
00:16:52,773 --> 00:16:54,119
Speaker 0: I was like, that's just the Spanish hustle.

251
00:16:55,401 --> 00:17:00,175
Speaker 0: I've never heard anyone call it the Spanish hustle hustle anywhere except that stupid nerdy science.

252
00:17:00,235 --> 00:17:01,579
Speaker 0: Olympia dance when I was a little kid.

253
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,952
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I've done that dance.

254
00:17:06,494 --> 00:17:07,138
Speaker 0: it's electric.

255
00:17:09,481 --> 00:17:13,474
Speaker 1: Yeah back when you know me and all my relatives and friends were being all the bar mitzvahed.

256
00:17:13,494 --> 00:17:14,839
Speaker 1: cuz we're all Jews.

257
00:17:15,442 --> 00:17:17,107
Speaker 1: The Macarena was big in those days.

258
00:17:17,186 --> 00:17:18,771
Speaker 1: So we were doing Macarena's.

259
00:17:19,053 --> 00:17:20,257
Speaker 0: now is so dry here.

260
00:17:20,277 --> 00:17:22,659
Speaker 0: Yeah He's polyps in the back of my hand.

261
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:26,720
Speaker 0: Sorry, we just watched a bunch of South Park with Jew jokes.

262
00:17:28,067 --> 00:17:36,718
Speaker 1: Yeah Jews anyway It's electric All right, so today tell them that mp3.

263
00:17:37,922 --> 00:17:38,647
Speaker 0: That's a good idea.

264
00:17:38,687 --> 00:17:39,573
Speaker 0: Yeah, I might have it.

265
00:17:40,036 --> 00:17:41,423
Speaker 0: Whoo We'll have to look after.

266
00:17:41,463 --> 00:17:45,500
Speaker 0: we do the show people but before that we have to talk about free comic book day.

267
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,243
Speaker 1: All right.

268
00:17:46,605 --> 00:17:49,520
Speaker 1: Let's list all the comics that we got on a free comic book day.

269
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll know we're doing this partly because we haven't talked about comics in a while.

270
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:58,860
Speaker 1: That's mostly because I can talk about a whole lot of comics that I've bought and rim doesn't buy or read so many.

271
00:17:59,101 --> 00:18:02,112
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I thought I'd be commuting on the train doesn't look like I will be.

272
00:18:02,192 --> 00:18:04,902
Speaker 0: so I'm still reading my manga and my you Know books.

273
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,575
Speaker 1: Yeah, I read my comic books and then my books.

274
00:18:09,096 --> 00:18:10,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got a lot of good books.

275
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,611
Speaker 0: I just finished I doru which was actually awesome.

276
00:18:12,731 --> 00:18:12,892
Speaker 1: Yep.

277
00:18:13,334 --> 00:18:14,680
Speaker 0: We should talk about sci-fi books someday.

278
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:19,520
Speaker 1: Alright so the we should probably talk them all about separately one book at a time.

279
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,174
Speaker 1: Okay, the first comic that we got for free was from Dark Horse.

280
00:18:23,254 --> 00:18:24,840
Speaker 1: It's half Star Wars half Conan.

281
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:29,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, we got all the like gold sponsor whatever is except I think one.

282
00:18:29,941 --> 00:18:30,724
Speaker 1: Yeah, we got all.

283
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:34,053
Speaker 1: if you go to free comic book day calm and you click on the comics.

284
00:18:34,495 --> 00:18:42,520
Speaker 1: You'll notice that there are Gold sponsors and like silver sponsors there are people who paid more to diamond distributors and people who paid less.

285
00:18:43,142 --> 00:18:44,427
Speaker 1: Anyone who paid more.

286
00:18:44,788 --> 00:18:46,877
Speaker 1: we got their book except for Tokyo pop.

287
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:50,614
Speaker 0: We didn't get Tokyo pop Yeah, mostly because the comic shop we went to was kind of scary.

288
00:18:50,674 --> 00:18:52,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's pretty good.

289
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,470
Speaker 1: They gave us a whole big fat thing.

290
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:54,919
Speaker 1: Usually they let you take like four.

291
00:18:55,296 --> 00:18:56,966
Speaker 0: Yeah The thing is they look kind of pissed.

292
00:18:56,986 --> 00:19:02,267
Speaker 0: when we walked in we looked at every single piece of merchandise They had didn't buy anything.

293
00:19:02,287 --> 00:19:03,351
Speaker 1: took the free comics and left.

294
00:19:03,472 --> 00:19:04,255
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever.

295
00:19:04,295 --> 00:19:05,118
Speaker 1: It's free comic book day.

296
00:19:05,138 --> 00:19:06,946
Speaker 1: Screw you Yeah, you didn't pay for these comics.

297
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:07,990
Speaker 1: They just gave them to you.

298
00:19:08,171 --> 00:19:10,180
Speaker 0: Well, all they had was crappy comics.

299
00:19:10,401 --> 00:19:10,561
Speaker 0: Yep.

300
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:11,184
Speaker 0: All right.

301
00:19:11,244 --> 00:19:19,057
Speaker 1: Anyway, and the only thing we got this top 100 trade paperbacks of all time But I think it's kind of crummy and it wasn't one of the gold sponsors.

302
00:19:19,077 --> 00:19:19,880
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna talk about it.

303
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,643
Speaker 0: Yeah, though it does list.

304
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,527
Speaker 0: watchman is number two.

305
00:19:21,768 --> 00:19:21,969
Speaker 0: Yep.

306
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:22,290
Speaker 1: All right.

307
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,620
Speaker 1: So the first comic is from Dark Horse.

308
00:19:24,721 --> 00:19:26,229
Speaker 1: It's half Star Wars half Conan.

309
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,220
Speaker 0: then we got DC Justice League unlimited.

310
00:19:28,722 --> 00:19:38,216
Speaker 1: Then there's something from devil's do press who's a really good publisher, but it's GI Joe sigma six, which isn't God Donald Duck, which is kind of cool from gemstone.

311
00:19:38,256 --> 00:19:38,819
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's cool.

312
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:51,885
Speaker 1: a Simpsons comic from Bongo Yep a Future Shock thing from image which contains like a whole bunch of different comics that are all somewhat related to future Stuff.

313
00:19:52,026 --> 00:19:52,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll say right now.

314
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,479
Speaker 0: They're all ass, but we'll get to that.

315
00:19:55,389 --> 00:19:56,320
Speaker 1: from IDW.

316
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:00,180
Speaker 1: There's two transformers comics one regular one and one Beast Wars one.

317
00:20:00,521 --> 00:20:04,814
Speaker 1: And of course the cut the transformers comic that I'm interested in transformers evolutions.

318
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:12,614
Speaker 1: They only have like a little preview of it in here Marvel x-men runaways, which is the x-men and the runaways together.

319
00:20:12,835 --> 00:20:15,388
Speaker 1: and there's some other stuff in here, too Which we'll talk about.

320
00:20:15,952 --> 00:20:17,080
Speaker 0: and of course Archie.

321
00:20:18,101 --> 00:20:19,547
Speaker 1: I've never read an Archie comic in my life.

322
00:20:19,567 --> 00:20:22,520
Speaker 0: Neither have I. this was the first one I ever ever ever ever ever read.

323
00:20:22,682 --> 00:20:22,885
Speaker 1: Yep.

324
00:20:23,047 --> 00:20:29,335
Speaker 1: All right, so The Star Wars from Dark Horse, it was pretty stereotypical predictable.

325
00:20:29,355 --> 00:20:31,340
Speaker 0: It was a lot like the Clone Wars cartoon.

326
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:36,624
Speaker 1: I was gonna say it's almost exactly like the Clone Wars cartoons where you know The stormtroopers.

327
00:20:37,005 --> 00:20:38,209
Speaker 1: they don't say anything.

328
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,915
Speaker 1: They just is quiet.

329
00:20:40,015 --> 00:20:41,400
Speaker 1: Star Wars action?

330
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:52,354
Speaker 0: No, no dialogue lots of shooting and blasters and explosions and it's really I got to say I mean this stuff's all cool, but it's like it's just fan service for the Clone Wars.

331
00:20:52,395 --> 00:20:53,037
Speaker 0: There's nothing.

332
00:20:53,137 --> 00:20:54,160
Speaker 0: there's nothing to it.

333
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,126
Speaker 0: It's not Star Wars.

334
00:20:55,186 --> 00:20:57,400
Speaker 0: It's just guys shooting robots.

335
00:20:57,901 --> 00:21:05,379
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing about this is I guess it's mildly if you have ten seconds where you're not entertained You can spend your time reading this.

336
00:21:06,622 --> 00:21:06,824
Speaker 1: it'll.

337
00:21:07,005 --> 00:21:17,304
Speaker 1: it's a good filler, but Since it's not animated you really lose a lot because it's the exact same thing as the Clone Wars cartoon without the movement But it's all action.

338
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:28,223
Speaker 1: So a lot is left up to the imagination, which is which is okay if you have a good imagination But at the same time it there's nothing really to make you Imagine.

339
00:21:28,364 --> 00:21:37,699
Speaker 0: it's drawn in style and I've seen other comics where they draw it like this where it's like It's based on something that has real people like it's based on something that has real actors in it.

340
00:21:38,201 --> 00:21:44,487
Speaker 0: So they draw the characters who are from whatever they're basing it on Really really accurately.

341
00:21:44,568 --> 00:21:46,635
Speaker 0: so you don't think like wait a minute.

342
00:21:46,695 --> 00:21:51,079
Speaker 0: That's not what obi-wan looks like But as a result, they seem to draw them just kind of a.

343
00:21:51,099 --> 00:21:56,676
Speaker 1: I Think the some of the drawings of like the stormtroopers and the equipment.

344
00:21:56,977 --> 00:21:58,504
Speaker 0: Oh, that's fine Yeah, they look pretty good.

345
00:21:58,524 --> 00:21:59,951
Speaker 1: And that's most of the comic.

346
00:21:59,991 --> 00:22:06,336
Speaker 0: So yeah, but look at the last page That's one panel is as a crappy obi-wan face in it and then a crappy Jango Fett.

347
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:10,693
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, I just thought of it because the Firefly comic did the same thing.

348
00:22:10,974 --> 00:22:14,387
Speaker 0: good comic, but they really drew it Just kind of yeah, whatever.

349
00:22:14,527 --> 00:22:17,097
Speaker 0: as long as it looks like the characters doesn't matter how we actually draw it.

350
00:22:17,117 --> 00:22:17,498
Speaker 0: Yeah.

351
00:22:17,699 --> 00:22:20,933
Speaker 1: All right It's like about the Conan comic in the other half.

352
00:22:21,033 --> 00:22:22,100
Speaker 0: I actually kind of like the Conan.

353
00:22:22,361 --> 00:22:28,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know what it was, but it seemed it was really generic the story but at the same time it wasn't too bad.

354
00:22:29,502 --> 00:22:32,173
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only thing that bothered me was all right.

355
00:22:32,234 --> 00:22:37,294
Speaker 1: if the wizard needed the spear Why the hell did he leave it downstairs all that time and go get it at the last minute?

356
00:22:37,555 --> 00:22:38,800
Speaker 1: Yeah that it was fine.

357
00:22:39,121 --> 00:22:40,505
Speaker 0: I mean slayers the anime.

358
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:47,286
Speaker 0: to handle that the best in the first season where the evil guy has the thing he needs to finish His ritual and the what does he do?

359
00:22:47,627 --> 00:22:51,200
Speaker 0: He immediately fucking runs away and does his thing as soon as he can.

360
00:22:52,002 --> 00:22:53,757
Speaker 1: Yep, this didn't have that.

361
00:22:55,163 --> 00:22:58,502
Speaker 0: Plus it was kind of intellectually Void.

362
00:22:58,764 --> 00:23:00,070
Speaker 0: there's not much to Conan.

363
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:05,040
Speaker 0: Well, he's not much to this Conan But I can see a nice subtle.

364
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:14,320
Speaker 0: I mean look the the guy Who the Conan killed was so self-important and sure that he was right and sure that nothing could stop him that that was his downfall.

365
00:23:15,101 --> 00:23:17,831
Speaker 0: Yeah, so yeah, there's a little bit there but a little bit not much.

366
00:23:18,332 --> 00:23:22,939
Speaker 1: Yeah, all I can really say about this Conan is It wasn't painful to read.

367
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:30,054
Speaker 0: You know It's really sad To say that about free comic book day that the best we can say about something so far is.

368
00:23:30,415 --> 00:23:31,620
Speaker 0: it wasn't painful to read.

369
00:23:32,101 --> 00:23:35,935
Speaker 1: Yeah, the art was actually pretty good as his nice sort of D&D look.

370
00:23:36,196 --> 00:23:37,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, which I don't mind.

371
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,889
Speaker 1: It looks like the Monster Manual art only a little simpler.

372
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, the new Monster Manual art, not the third edition third edition.

373
00:23:43,141 --> 00:23:47,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know if I saw Conan, but I used to completely ignore Conan.

374
00:23:47,421 --> 00:23:47,964
Speaker 1: What did I care?

375
00:23:48,024 --> 00:23:55,119
Speaker 1: but now I guess if I see a Conan book in the comic shop I might pick it up and flip through it to see if it's interesting or more of the same.

376
00:23:56,147 --> 00:23:57,620
Speaker 0: All right, Justice League.

377
00:23:58,461 --> 00:24:01,560
Speaker 0: Now when I read it, it went from all right.

378
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,488
Speaker 0: This is actually kind of good to.

379
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:11,714
Speaker 0: this is complete shit over the course of one page worth of plot Alright, so this is Justice League Unlimited.

380
00:24:11,754 --> 00:24:13,020
Speaker 1: So it's not the real Justice League.

381
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:16,779
Speaker 1: It's based on the cartoon show that you know, it looks just like the cartoon show.

382
00:24:18,101 --> 00:24:28,120
Speaker 1: So on the first page you got you know Like oh my god, crazy things are happening, but I don't even know who half the characters on this page are first off.

383
00:24:29,005 --> 00:24:32,821
Speaker 1: I mean it puts their names at the bottom of the page, but I Don't know.

384
00:24:33,203 --> 00:24:34,247
Speaker 0: Well, I know what their powers are.

385
00:24:34,287 --> 00:24:37,097
Speaker 0: I know who Batman, Wonder Woman, Superman and The Flash were.

386
00:24:37,117 --> 00:24:37,800
Speaker 1: That's all I knew.

387
00:24:38,203 --> 00:24:39,576
Speaker 1: I don't know who that white guy.

388
00:24:39,596 --> 00:24:47,142
Speaker 1: it says here He's Captain Adam and then it says Zatanna and Hawkgirl which are pretty easy to figure out which one was which I had seen Hawkgirl Before.

389
00:24:47,564 --> 00:24:49,975
Speaker 1: all right, but I didn't know what their powers were or anything.

390
00:24:49,995 --> 00:24:50,940
Speaker 1: It didn't explain it to me.

391
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,880
Speaker 1: But oh god looks like a kid's comic.

392
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,506
Speaker 1: So maybe the kids know.

393
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:55,308
Speaker 1: I don't know.

394
00:24:55,529 --> 00:25:04,700
Speaker 1: a lot of kids don't read comics and I guess if a kid watched the show they Would know it had the bolding The bolding of the words not as bad as some other comics have had it.

395
00:25:04,781 --> 00:25:07,540
Speaker 0: I consider the bolding to be a kind of cancer or a plague.

396
00:25:08,043 --> 00:25:10,940
Speaker 1: Well, I'm looking at some of the bolding on page two and it's not so bad.

397
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,703
Speaker 0: That's like.

398
00:25:11,763 --> 00:25:12,927
Speaker 1: it makes a little bit of sense.

399
00:25:13,068 --> 00:25:14,673
Speaker 0: It makes more than page three.

400
00:25:14,734 --> 00:25:16,420
Speaker 1: It makes a little bit less sense.

401
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,455
Speaker 0: It makes more sense than the bolding in any comic I've ever read ever.

402
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:25,753
Speaker 1: All right But yeah The plot starts out where you're kind of wondering exactly what's going on like.

403
00:25:25,793 --> 00:25:31,577
Speaker 1: there's a nice setup and a little mystery You know, it's like alright what's going on here?

404
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:39,972
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean, I hate superhero comics and it was enough for me to really want to know how this was gonna end Yep, and then at the end it was just silly.

405
00:25:40,193 --> 00:25:41,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was just the explanation was crap.

406
00:25:42,326 --> 00:25:43,740
Speaker 0: It was just deus ex machina crap.

407
00:25:44,021 --> 00:25:54,152
Speaker 0: Like the whole thing is we tested and we couldn't find the problem and then suddenly the villains appear and say ah Here is our plan and intricate text detail for everyone who couldn't figure it out.

408
00:25:54,934 --> 00:25:56,900
Speaker 0: Oh, there's a mystic thing that you couldn't detect

409
00:25:58,941 --> 00:26:15,600
Speaker 1: The thing that I really didn't like about it the thing that made it subpar was the fact that It didn't really matter what you could have replaced in all these characters with just like a stick figure of a different color like There was no personality to anyone.

410
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,572
Speaker 1: Everyone was just a hero with the same personality.

411
00:26:18,673 --> 00:26:23,193
Speaker 1: only Batman had a slightly different Personality to him because he was the one who figured things out.

412
00:26:23,233 --> 00:26:24,660
Speaker 1: cuz he's Batman he figures things out.

413
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:30,260
Speaker 1: He always figures out that the only difference between the characters other than that was their powers.

414
00:26:30,862 --> 00:26:32,667
Speaker 1: They didn't have a different personality.

415
00:26:32,707 --> 00:26:36,860
Speaker 0: They all had the same dialogue, but other than the magic girl, they didn't even use their powers.

416
00:26:37,002 --> 00:26:38,038
Speaker 0: They were just kind of there.

417
00:26:38,821 --> 00:26:45,616
Speaker 1: Yeah, there were these generic, you know when you have a story you have to be like, okay He's the angry guy and he's the sad guy.

418
00:26:45,677 --> 00:26:48,347
Speaker 1: and he you know The different personalities and different characters.

419
00:26:48,768 --> 00:26:50,454
Speaker 1: all the characters are the same personality.

420
00:26:50,715 --> 00:26:52,340
Speaker 1: We're heroes and we're gonna beat the bad guy.

421
00:26:52,461 --> 00:26:53,572
Speaker 1: that was all they had to him.

422
00:26:53,593 --> 00:27:07,071
Speaker 0: and Yeah, except for Batman Yeah, the only thing I got out of this and I got to say if I get my scanner to work or if I find An image online there's no page numbers But there's a Scooby-doo ad and the page before the Scooby-doo ad.

423
00:27:07,532 --> 00:27:13,233
Speaker 0: if I replace the text bubbles with different words I can make a very funny sexual joke.

424
00:27:13,656 --> 00:27:20,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz it shows Superman standing in front of hot girl and then Wonder Woman appears and puts her hand on hot girl shoulder.

425
00:27:21,422 --> 00:27:33,574
Speaker 1: then hot girl turns around and looks at Wonder Woman like ooh, and then both Superman and Wonder Woman put their arms Hands on hot girl shoulder and in the fourth panel Batman gets this smirk.

426
00:27:34,598 --> 00:27:35,260
Speaker 1: I don't see him there.

427
00:27:35,721 --> 00:27:38,411
Speaker 0: He's got this little smirk his smile not even in the panel.

428
00:27:38,732 --> 00:27:40,317
Speaker 1: Yeah is where I don't see him.

429
00:27:40,718 --> 00:27:41,160
Speaker 0: Superman.

430
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,444
Speaker 1: Oh, you said Batman.

431
00:27:42,565 --> 00:27:43,528
Speaker 0: I did I meant Superman.

432
00:27:43,608 --> 00:27:45,535
Speaker 0: Okay, Superman gets this little smirk.

433
00:27:45,776 --> 00:27:46,077
Speaker 0: Yep.

434
00:27:46,238 --> 00:27:48,706
Speaker 1: No, yeah Batman Oh, I do it in the last panel.

435
00:27:48,786 --> 00:27:51,916
Speaker 1: It totally looks like Wonder Woman has her hand on hot girls boob.

436
00:27:52,157 --> 00:27:52,538
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah.

437
00:27:52,719 --> 00:27:54,830
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, so yeah, that's Justice League.

438
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:55,896
Speaker 0: That's what I got out of that.

439
00:27:56,278 --> 00:28:00,555
Speaker 1: All right GI Joe's Sigma six is crap.

440
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:01,459
Speaker 1: see our.

441
00:28:02,601 --> 00:28:08,820
Speaker 1: Actually, this one had an advantage over the other comics and that the entire comic book was pretty much one story with very few ads.

442
00:28:09,784 --> 00:28:10,659
Speaker 1: That's the advantage.

443
00:28:12,602 --> 00:28:16,000
Speaker 1: The art looked like a TV show a kids cartoon.

444
00:28:17,124 --> 00:28:21,659
Speaker 1: the plot went like a kids cartoon and I think this thing is just here to sell toys.

445
00:28:22,363 --> 00:28:25,176
Speaker 0: Yeah, the worst thing is it fell in that stupid trap of all.

446
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:28,029
Speaker 0: right We're gonna make all the bad guys robots.

447
00:28:28,311 --> 00:28:33,120
Speaker 0: that way we can kill them in cool ways But we don't get in trouble for killing people in a kid's thing.

448
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,626
Speaker 1: I didn't even know that didn't bother me.

449
00:28:35,007 --> 00:28:37,035
Speaker 1: the things that bothered me were a the Sharks.

450
00:28:37,618 --> 00:28:41,648
Speaker 1: Yeah B This one guy.

451
00:28:41,709 --> 00:28:43,177
Speaker 1: He's not his name isn't GI?

452
00:28:43,238 --> 00:28:43,559
Speaker 1: Joe?

453
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:49,539
Speaker 1: And he makes jokes about these little paper umbrellas like three times which aren't funny.

454
00:28:51,722 --> 00:28:52,604
Speaker 1: The bad guy.

455
00:28:52,645 --> 00:28:55,032
Speaker 1: there's only one Cobra bad guy Destro.

456
00:28:55,052 --> 00:28:58,743
Speaker 1: Yeah, and he's totally lame like Like.

457
00:28:58,985 --> 00:29:01,279
Speaker 1: until the last page he wasn't super lame.

458
00:29:01,682 --> 00:29:04,640
Speaker 1: But at the end he has like this funny face and he's like I need a vacation.

459
00:29:05,022 --> 00:29:06,611
Speaker 1: That's not something a villain says.

460
00:29:06,731 --> 00:29:08,260
Speaker 0: what the hell was he control?

461
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:13,324
Speaker 0: He has like a PSP to control the robot shark things And it has a silly.

462
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:13,625
Speaker 0: Yeah.

463
00:29:13,645 --> 00:29:18,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, Joe has this wicked awesome Sigma suit and Destro has a PSP to control some sharks.

464
00:29:19,681 --> 00:29:20,623
Speaker 0: It just wasn't good.

465
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:27,140
Speaker 1: No, I guess this is just for kids who like the modern GI Joe toys selling TV show.

466
00:29:27,523 --> 00:29:28,996
Speaker 0: I didn't even like the old GI Joe.

467
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:41,507
Speaker 1: The only GI Joe that's good is the movie GI Joe that I like is the one that has a million GI Joe guys like sergeant slaughter mostly and Cobra has a million guys like the guy with the gold head and Cobra commander and whatnot.

468
00:29:41,687 --> 00:29:42,873
Speaker 0: Don't forget the frickin movie.

469
00:29:43,335 --> 00:29:49,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, we should watch that Million blue lasers and a million green lasers shooting back and forth, but no one actually gets hit and dies.

470
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:50,651
Speaker 0: Yeah, I never liked it.

471
00:29:50,672 --> 00:29:51,320
Speaker 1: things explode.

472
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,209
Speaker 0: I never liked it when they had the ones where it's like here.

473
00:29:54,570 --> 00:30:06,400
Speaker 0: these three GI Joe's are gonna go on a crazy mission together All right now getting to probably one of the best comics in the lot Donald Duck, it's real old-school and real clever.

474
00:30:07,501 --> 00:30:10,108
Speaker 1: Yeah, it has three different Donald Duck stories in it.

475
00:30:10,469 --> 00:30:14,522
Speaker 1: They're mostly Huey Dewey and Louie stories, which is even better than Donald Duck stories Yep.

476
00:30:14,884 --> 00:30:16,994
Speaker 0: Now they're really really old-school.

477
00:30:17,034 --> 00:30:18,119
Speaker 0: That's the only way I can describe it.

478
00:30:18,392 --> 00:30:29,372
Speaker 1: Yeah The first one is Huey Dewey and Louie skip school and crazy stuff happens and they almost get caught by Donald like ten times And it's it goes like a Looney Tune or an old Donald Duck cartoon.

479
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:40,960
Speaker 0: The only weird thing about it is that the writing it's Very I guess good in terms of the fact that they talk like normal human beings Which doesn't seem to happen in most comics.

480
00:30:41,863 --> 00:30:45,032
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the the duck voices are.

481
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:49,566
Speaker 1: they don't even have to put the duck voice in the writing like you have it in Your head because you see who's talking.

482
00:30:49,947 --> 00:30:51,473
Speaker 0: It's just it's old-school.

483
00:30:51,533 --> 00:30:53,079
Speaker 0: again is the only way I can describe this.

484
00:30:54,561 --> 00:31:04,191
Speaker 1: the art looks just like a duck tales cartoon, you know, even though I think the Donald's little sailor suit is the old-school one at the new school one.

485
00:31:04,331 --> 00:31:12,196
Speaker 1: Yeah, but yeah, it's just generally Typical and humorous and I mean I laughed and I'm not a little kid.

486
00:31:12,216 --> 00:31:13,260
Speaker 0: I enjoyed it.

487
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,319
Speaker 0: I like the cartoons more I guess but I grew up.

488
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:24,380
Speaker 1: The thing is this isn't the best Donald Duck ever now, but it's still pretty good It's at least compared to this other stuff we got in this pile.

489
00:31:24,661 --> 00:31:28,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, though I got this hankering suddenly to watch all the old Donald Ducks.

490
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,755
Speaker 1: Yeah, I really like the last story with the caveman who was like uncle Scrooge.

491
00:31:31,815 --> 00:31:36,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was good Especially when it's like oh look they made a funny about uncle Scrooge.

492
00:31:38,662 --> 00:31:42,259
Speaker 1: All right Bongo the Simpsons, yeah, I don't know why they called it.

493
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:46,919
Speaker 1: I guess the publisher is Bongo, but they said Bongo comics free-for-all.

494
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:52,435
Speaker 0: now I have somewhere like all the original Simpsons comics from when the first one was released.

495
00:31:52,776 --> 00:31:57,840
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm and They pretty much as far as I can tell never changed in quality at all.

496
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:01,239
Speaker 0: They're the exact same level of humor and quality now that they were way back.

497
00:32:01,942 --> 00:32:09,467
Speaker 0: If you're really really really like the Simpsons then yeah, all this taught us is that The Simpsons I mean the writing.

498
00:32:09,567 --> 00:32:15,647
Speaker 0: if you close your eyes you read this comic and then you pretend you can't see it and you Imagine it being acted out in your head.

499
00:32:15,687 --> 00:32:16,490
Speaker 0: It's kind of funny.

500
00:32:16,992 --> 00:32:18,478
Speaker 0: It's like current Simpsons season.

501
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:30,939
Speaker 1: funny Yeah, I mean the first story is obviously with comic book guy and he becomes a strong dude and instead of a weak-ass lame comic book guy and you know Nelson beat someone up and says haha.

502
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:36,205
Speaker 0: and But without comic book Joe without the animation and the comedic timing and the voices It's just.

503
00:32:36,305 --> 00:32:37,233
Speaker 0: it's not that funny.

504
00:32:37,293 --> 00:32:38,100
Speaker 0: It's just kind of lame.

505
00:32:39,022 --> 00:32:46,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of the jokes are timing related Although I did laugh when I saw the Springfield tire yard on fire next to the Opera House.

506
00:32:47,368 --> 00:32:47,819
Speaker 1: That was good.

507
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:54,876
Speaker 0: The only part I really laughed was when they have it early on when they have that long bit that basically just makes fun of comic nerds.

508
00:32:55,941 --> 00:33:00,500
Speaker 1: But that's what comic book guy does and I'm giving out a free comic book on comic book day.

509
00:33:00,902 --> 00:33:05,260
Speaker 1: The way to appeal to the people reading it is to make comic jokes that they'll laugh at more.

510
00:33:05,622 --> 00:33:08,600
Speaker 1: It's like penny arcade you give it to video game people and they laugh.

511
00:33:08,761 --> 00:33:14,020
Speaker 1: So you make a comic joke and you give it to comic people and they laugh and that way maybe they'll buy Simpsons comics.

512
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:22,272
Speaker 0: I guess this just reminded me a lot of like the old Beavis and Butthead comic and just those generally not great Comics that are based on TV or cartoons.

513
00:33:22,815 --> 00:33:26,806
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Yeah in the middle There was a bit with Bender.

514
00:33:27,087 --> 00:33:29,697
Speaker 1: that was kind of funny because I like Bender a lot.

515
00:33:30,078 --> 00:33:33,431
Speaker 1: if it hadn't been It seemed like a forced bender.

516
00:33:33,571 --> 00:33:34,415
Speaker 1: that was the problem.

517
00:33:34,435 --> 00:33:37,868
Speaker 1: if it wasn't the true Benderness you can't force bender.

518
00:33:38,089 --> 00:33:44,377
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like they drew Bender and they forced Benderness out of him to make him, you know, and it wasn't.

519
00:33:44,678 --> 00:33:46,159
Speaker 1: it wasn't natural.

520
00:33:47,522 --> 00:33:52,280
Speaker 1: And then let's see if the last story was about Homer was a superhero named pie man.

521
00:33:52,802 --> 00:33:56,175
Speaker 0: No, the last one was with nuclear power man and iron foot.

522
00:33:56,938 --> 00:34:02,249
Speaker 1: Oh Well, there's Homer being the pie man Which I guess it was.

523
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:03,495
Speaker 0: it wasn't really funny.

524
00:34:03,756 --> 00:34:04,580
Speaker 0: Not at all.

525
00:34:05,142 --> 00:34:08,454
Speaker 1: It was just a Simpsons story with no humor whatsoever.

526
00:34:08,735 --> 00:34:10,139
Speaker 0: The last story was even less funny.

527
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:14,533
Speaker 1: Well the last story I think I liked.

528
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:15,918
Speaker 1: how discos do is the bad guy?

529
00:34:17,161 --> 00:34:18,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's all it's got going.

530
00:34:18,331 --> 00:34:21,456
Speaker 1: they made a village people joke And that was that.

531
00:34:22,563 --> 00:34:26,116
Speaker 1: Alright, whatever Future shock I wouldn't buy Simpsons comics if I were.

532
00:34:26,136 --> 00:34:30,295
Speaker 0: you know We should go through each of the comics and we should go through.

533
00:34:30,315 --> 00:34:32,409
Speaker 1: each of the comics is one of them I think is better than the others.

534
00:34:33,036 --> 00:34:34,822
Speaker 0: All right Fear agent.

535
00:34:34,842 --> 00:34:36,751
Speaker 0: I have no idea what's going on.

536
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:38,297
Speaker 1: I have no idea what the hell's going on either.

537
00:34:38,317 --> 00:34:40,168
Speaker 0: Don't ask me It's really generically drawn.

538
00:34:40,188 --> 00:34:42,120
Speaker 0: There's something about a giant brain and the future.

539
00:34:42,442 --> 00:34:46,199
Speaker 0: They throw you into the middle of the story and then they take you out before the end.

540
00:34:46,742 --> 00:34:47,386
Speaker 1: it's like you get.

541
00:34:47,406 --> 00:34:55,440
Speaker 1: let's see one two three four pages of Where you get like this hint of what could possibly be going on, I don't know what this comics about.

542
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,225
Speaker 1: It just forget.

543
00:34:57,245 --> 00:35:01,780
Speaker 0: the last line is you you're from the future one in which you murder me.

544
00:35:02,201 --> 00:35:03,044
Speaker 1: oh, that's right.

545
00:35:03,285 --> 00:35:08,682
Speaker 1: this guy's like arguing with an evil brain alien and The.

546
00:35:08,823 --> 00:35:13,179
Speaker 1: the brain alien figures out that this guy is a time traveler or no.

547
00:35:13,521 --> 00:35:17,420
Speaker 1: It figures out that this guy is going to kill the brain in the future.

548
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:24,880
Speaker 1: Whatever it's just a crazy plot and you don't get enough of it to know whether you like it or not, but it's just crazy.

549
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,023
Speaker 0: Now godland.

550
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:30,836
Speaker 1: All right before even knowing what the story is in godland.

551
00:35:31,277 --> 00:35:32,180
Speaker 1: Look at this craziness.

552
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:37,174
Speaker 1: He had like these really weird creatures fighting very superhero style fighting.

553
00:35:37,575 --> 00:35:39,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they're the weirdest creatures.

554
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,449
Speaker 1: I can't know what the hell they are.

555
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,640
Speaker 1: They're supposed to be gods.

556
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,443
Speaker 1: Is that the story?

557
00:35:42,463 --> 00:35:46,820
Speaker 0: why it's called godland, but then it turns into a completely different comic about this girl.

558
00:35:47,403 --> 00:35:50,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, who's in a spaceship that is hurtling out of control or something?

559
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,005
Speaker 0: And then it does the.

560
00:35:52,428 --> 00:35:52,649
Speaker 0: I want.

561
00:35:52,669 --> 00:35:56,500
Speaker 0: I don't want to use the pretentious word I hate that word to describe things like this.

562
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:04,999
Speaker 0: But it goes into one of those comic book Crapfests where they have a lot of descriptive text that's supposed to sound literate and meaningful and cool, but it's just dumb.

563
00:36:06,361 --> 00:36:09,392
Speaker 1: But in her mind's eye the unique awareness of her soul.

564
00:36:09,472 --> 00:36:10,616
Speaker 1: She sees everything.

565
00:36:10,636 --> 00:36:16,293
Speaker 0: Yeah the fucking bowling Okay, the steel beast she rides constructed by the sweat-soaked hands of Earth.

566
00:36:16,313 --> 00:36:21,012
Speaker 0: men lurches once arcs wide and finally The next one.

567
00:36:21,092 --> 00:36:26,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, the next one is invincible, which I think is I guess the better than the other things in here.

568
00:36:26,941 --> 00:36:28,268
Speaker 0: It looks like it's supposed to be silly.

569
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:32,777
Speaker 1: Yeah, it looks sort of like Hitchhiker's guide.

570
00:36:33,443 --> 00:36:36,200
Speaker 0: Maybe yeah, but it also has this hint of Dragon Ball.

571
00:36:36,481 --> 00:36:39,637
Speaker 1: It does have a hint of Dragon Ball, but I don't see any fighting in it.

572
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:42,699
Speaker 0: yet They keep talking about like power levels.

573
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:48,220
Speaker 1: Well, I think they're just saying you know how strong this guy is because they made him super strong.

574
00:36:48,821 --> 00:37:01,496
Speaker 1: I think it's a story about you know aliens and people from different races and how there's one guy and he's named Invincible and maybe he's an alien or something and he's really strong and he's a superhero.

575
00:37:01,516 --> 00:37:04,453
Speaker 1: I Don't know but there's a Cyclops alien.

576
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:05,179
Speaker 1: That's kind of silly.

577
00:37:06,201 --> 00:37:15,994
Speaker 0: Yeah, the guy takes his beard off - yeah, I don't know why because I am a vulture might and he takes the beard off Like that's supposed to mean something to me.

578
00:37:16,014 --> 00:37:19,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Guess it means something if you read the whole comic.

579
00:37:19,781 --> 00:37:27,434
Speaker 1: But if you don't know what a vulture might is and you don't know why taking your beard off I don't know how they're supposed to make you want to read this comic with something like that.

580
00:37:27,876 --> 00:37:28,800
Speaker 0: All right noble causes.

581
00:37:28,961 --> 00:37:29,867
Speaker 0: I got nothing to say about.

582
00:37:29,887 --> 00:37:31,035
Speaker 0: it's just so generic.

583
00:37:31,196 --> 00:37:33,383
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Completely agree.

584
00:37:33,403 --> 00:37:34,567
Speaker 0: generic superheroes.

585
00:37:34,808 --> 00:37:35,852
Speaker 1: It's there's a guy.

586
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:37,096
Speaker 1: He's a superhero.

587
00:37:37,116 --> 00:37:38,260
Speaker 1: There's a military.

588
00:37:38,501 --> 00:37:39,163
Speaker 1: They're fighting.

589
00:37:39,525 --> 00:37:43,740
Speaker 1: they call in the bad guys to stop the good superhero from doing bad.

590
00:37:44,744 --> 00:37:47,920
Speaker 1: But really, you know in the end the good superhero is really doing good.

591
00:37:48,021 --> 00:37:51,439
Speaker 1: The government just thinks he's doing bad and it's just obvious and cliche.

592
00:37:53,522 --> 00:37:57,339
Speaker 1: All right, Savage Dragon, this is like an old comic that a lot of people like.

593
00:37:58,842 --> 00:38:03,688
Speaker 1: I've never read it any of it before and from these four pages I'm probably never gonna read any of it anymore.

594
00:38:03,728 --> 00:38:06,360
Speaker 0: Anyway, I'm not really sure what it's about.

595
00:38:06,962 --> 00:38:09,790
Speaker 1: It's about this green guy who's the Savage Dragon.

596
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:12,096
Speaker 0: apparently has this girlfriend who doesn't trust it.

597
00:38:12,137 --> 00:38:14,243
Speaker 1: He seems like a lone Ninja Turtle.

598
00:38:14,263 --> 00:38:16,129
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what he is.

599
00:38:16,149 --> 00:38:17,754
Speaker 1: He's a Ninja Turtle solo.

600
00:38:17,855 --> 00:38:21,361
Speaker 0: Well, he's got that little thingy like Dr.

601
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:21,843
Speaker 0: Zoidberg.

602
00:38:21,863 --> 00:38:25,053
Speaker 0: does you mean a thin now, but they call it a thingy.

603
00:38:25,574 --> 00:38:29,026
Speaker 0: Okay, that's fine in fear trauma at least.

604
00:38:29,086 --> 00:38:42,068
Speaker 1: yeah, it seems like a comic about you know, a guy who's a green dragon creature and he's kind of silly and he has some plot behind him and Stuff happens to him, I guess.

605
00:38:42,811 --> 00:38:43,192
Speaker 0: Yeah.

606
00:38:43,453 --> 00:38:49,652
Speaker 1: Anyway Shadowhawk Actually, I don't know Wasn't what I might have.

607
00:38:49,752 --> 00:38:50,700
Speaker 1: Shadowhawk number one?

608
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,282
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.

609
00:38:51,343 --> 00:38:55,560
Speaker 0: wasn't the joke in Shadowhawk a similar joke to something that happened in gravity?

610
00:38:56,622 --> 00:38:59,533
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's the exact joke that happened in gravity actually.

611
00:38:59,554 --> 00:39:00,216
Speaker 0: so what the hell?

612
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:01,140
Speaker 1: yeah?

613
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,267
Speaker 1: Did this guy read gravity and steal the joke?

614
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:08,945
Speaker 1: basically the novice superhero gets tricked into carjacking For someone else.

615
00:39:09,386 --> 00:39:12,877
Speaker 1: it happened in the gravity comic where it was funny because I'd seen it before.

616
00:39:12,937 --> 00:39:13,599
Speaker 1: it wasn't funny.

617
00:39:15,322 --> 00:39:17,008
Speaker 1: It's just a novice superhero sucks.

618
00:39:17,028 --> 00:39:17,952
Speaker 1: He looks pretty cool.

619
00:39:18,193 --> 00:39:20,000
Speaker 1: I got to say that with a shiny helmet.

620
00:39:21,661 --> 00:39:23,326
Speaker 1: If I was super hero I wouldn't mind that costume.

621
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,535
Speaker 0: yeah, but I I don't know what to think of this I.

622
00:39:29,543 --> 00:39:30,699
Speaker 1: It's such a generic.

623
00:39:31,242 --> 00:39:32,827
Speaker 1: Very it's like a short skit.

624
00:39:32,867 --> 00:39:36,520
Speaker 1: You can't really tell what Shadowhawk is about or anything based on this.

625
00:39:37,022 --> 00:39:41,860
Speaker 1: All you can tell is it's a superhero comic about a novice superhero and that's what he looks like.

626
00:39:42,061 --> 00:39:42,945
Speaker 1: That's all you can tell.

627
00:39:42,965 --> 00:39:47,291
Speaker 1: you don't really know what his powers are except for maybe acrobatics, I guess.

628
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:49,900
Speaker 0: Spawn.

629
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,933
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know I never read a spawn comic ever until now.

630
00:39:54,395 --> 00:39:59,261
Speaker 0: It's really just kind of boring and trite I Don't know.

631
00:39:59,301 --> 00:40:01,070
Speaker 1: It's like spawn is there.

632
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:03,160
Speaker 1: He's a scary dude spawn.

633
00:40:03,241 --> 00:40:05,558
Speaker 1: You know that you know the spawns a scary dude.

634
00:40:06,081 --> 00:40:06,803
Speaker 0: But then they have this.

635
00:40:06,843 --> 00:40:16,379
Speaker 0: you know this thing about granny and this little kid and oh spawn is an angel and obviously Some sort of metaphor symbolism that probably makes more sense if you know what the hell's going on.

636
00:40:17,242 --> 00:40:21,674
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think all this four pages tells me is that spawn is a scary.

637
00:40:21,714 --> 00:40:22,216
Speaker 1: scary.

638
00:40:22,236 --> 00:40:27,599
Speaker 1: scary, dude, but really he's good But he's really scary, but he's good not bad.

639
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:31,412
Speaker 0: Yeah, once it wasn't really enough to say anything about spawn.

640
00:40:31,833 --> 00:40:33,840
Speaker 1: nope other than he's a scary dude who's actually good?

641
00:40:34,762 --> 00:40:40,179
Speaker 0: Now the last one which played never actually read any of it, but I know what it is.

642
00:40:40,259 --> 00:40:48,360
Speaker 0: in fact I made fun of it in the forum a little while ago Because I've seen it the covers of it and all these comic shops, and it's I lump it in with lady death.

643
00:40:48,725 --> 00:40:54,560
Speaker 0: It's a comic that on the cover There's a mostly naked woman with large breasts and tiny bits of something covering her naughty bits.

644
00:40:55,302 --> 00:41:06,680
Speaker 1: I knew nothing about which blade but apparently the witch blade is this weapon thing that kind of Attaches to your body or something and this girl had it, but then she lost it to this other girl.

645
00:41:07,182 --> 00:41:11,259
Speaker 0: And that's that the cover of every one of them is just a mostly naked woman wearing this thing.

646
00:41:12,046 --> 00:41:22,836
Speaker 1: Yep, so And not not much really happens here other than you find out that there's a girl And she had a thing called the witch blade which was a dangerous weapon and now someone else has it.

647
00:41:23,158 --> 00:41:23,760
Speaker 1: dumb dumb dumb.

648
00:41:24,764 --> 00:41:25,495
Speaker 1: That's all you find out.

649
00:41:26,642 --> 00:41:29,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, there really wasn't anything worth reading in that whole thing.

650
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:34,080
Speaker 1: We only spent a lot of time talking about this because it had freaking a whole bunch of four-page stories in it.

651
00:41:35,734 --> 00:41:37,991
Speaker 0: All right Transformers we can talk a little bit about that.

652
00:41:38,091 --> 00:41:38,533
Speaker 0: I mean here.

653
00:41:38,574 --> 00:41:39,699
Speaker 0: We got what bumblebee?

654
00:41:40,761 --> 00:41:43,832
Speaker 1: Alright first of all and the inside of the the opening cover.

655
00:41:43,852 --> 00:41:46,300
Speaker 1: There's a picture from Transformers generations.

656
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:46,742
Speaker 1: They're just.

657
00:41:46,782 --> 00:41:47,866
Speaker 1: that's what I want to read.

658
00:41:47,886 --> 00:41:49,151
Speaker 1: That's real transformers.

659
00:41:49,171 --> 00:41:49,593
Speaker 1: look at that.

660
00:41:50,155 --> 00:41:51,400
Speaker 1: see that giant sound wave.

661
00:41:51,761 --> 00:41:53,408
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they put this text on it.

662
00:41:53,448 --> 00:41:54,231
Speaker 0: that isn't from it.

663
00:41:54,672 --> 00:41:56,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like hey read Transformers comics.

664
00:41:57,861 --> 00:42:02,256
Speaker 1: If the Transformers comics looks like that I'm gonna buy those ones transformers generations.

665
00:42:02,297 --> 00:42:04,546
Speaker 0: I can remember generations Yeah, but no we don't get that.

666
00:42:04,787 --> 00:42:06,133
Speaker 1: we don't get transformers generation.

667
00:42:06,153 --> 00:42:09,664
Speaker 0: We get infiltration infiltration Which it's drawn.

668
00:42:09,744 --> 00:42:12,673
Speaker 0: it looks like it's in that style that like every new comic is in.

669
00:42:13,235 --> 00:42:14,740
Speaker 1: it looks like shiny transformers to me.

670
00:42:14,981 --> 00:42:19,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's got this orange haze over a lot of it, but that's because they're in the yellow transformership.

671
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,966
Speaker 0: I think it's hard to tell what's going on.

672
00:42:21,987 --> 00:42:23,010
Speaker 0: There's a lot of talking.

673
00:42:23,732 --> 00:42:31,354
Speaker 1: it seems that the transfer the Autobots are having an argument over whether someone was supposed to do something and it's it's.

674
00:42:31,535 --> 00:42:37,212
Speaker 1: it's looks like It could be just any generic argument between military guys over.

675
00:42:37,293 --> 00:42:38,135
Speaker 1: you shouldn't have done that.

676
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:39,057
Speaker 1: you should have done this.

677
00:42:39,077 --> 00:42:41,749
Speaker 1: you're not following the Military rules whatnot?

678
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:43,780
Speaker 0: yeah like it has nothing to do with transformers.

679
00:42:43,921 --> 00:42:44,946
Speaker 1: That's the thing that bothered me.

680
00:42:45,006 --> 00:42:50,729
Speaker 1: if you're gonna make a Transformers comic you need to have Transforming and flying and fighting Decepticons.

681
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:51,913
Speaker 1: this has none of those things.

682
00:42:51,953 --> 00:42:53,780
Speaker 1: this could have been any military dudes.

683
00:42:54,264 --> 00:42:56,079
Speaker 1: They just put transformers in their place.

684
00:42:56,441 --> 00:43:03,946
Speaker 1: They don't even transform what the hell and then they give you a nice what the fuck at the end and then at the end They're like here the Decepticons doing evil.

685
00:43:04,668 --> 00:43:05,210
Speaker 1: That's a duh.

686
00:43:06,521 --> 00:43:10,180
Speaker 0: Now it just gets better because the other half of this is Beast Wars.

687
00:43:11,301 --> 00:43:14,728
Speaker 0: Great Beast Wars has the worst bolding I've ever seen.

688
00:43:15,349 --> 00:43:16,933
Speaker 0: it's got a terminal case of bolding.

689
00:43:17,374 --> 00:43:19,879
Speaker 0: really it bolds freaking every other word.

690
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,383
Speaker 0: Randomly here's.

691
00:43:22,423 --> 00:43:25,130
Speaker 0: here's a text bubble where every word in it is bold except one.

692
00:43:26,632 --> 00:43:30,410
Speaker 1: Between optimus primals maximals and Megatron's Predacons.

693
00:43:31,132 --> 00:43:36,990
Speaker 1: More and more Predacon avatars arise to swell Megatron's ranks their former allegiance forgotten.

694
00:43:37,371 --> 00:43:42,087
Speaker 0: There are so many escalates there are so many made-up words and just crap.

695
00:43:42,168 --> 00:43:47,606
Speaker 1: in Beast Wars Here's the worst one his mission isolate and contain the renegade.

696
00:43:47,967 --> 00:43:52,849
Speaker 0: Oh and don't forget the crap We remain cronally displaced by one or two nano clicks.

697
00:43:53,895 --> 00:44:02,944
Speaker 1: Yeah You know I didn't like Beast Wars when I saw one episode of the TV show back in the day And this makes me dislike Beast Wars even more.

698
00:44:03,547 --> 00:44:05,272
Speaker 1: It's like Seems.

699
00:44:05,312 --> 00:44:10,150
Speaker 1: the only reason they ever made Beast Wars is some kids don't like cars and planes.

700
00:44:10,451 --> 00:44:11,575
Speaker 1: They might like animals.

701
00:44:11,996 --> 00:44:15,910
Speaker 1: so they made transforming animals for so they can sell to those other kids.

702
00:44:18,191 --> 00:44:21,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right, so we got this X-Men runaways.

703
00:44:21,221 --> 00:44:21,381
Speaker 0: well.

704
00:44:21,441 --> 00:44:23,147
Speaker 1: No in the middle of this comic though.

705
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:23,709
Speaker 1: I want to.

706
00:44:23,729 --> 00:44:24,773
Speaker 0: oh There's something in there.

707
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:26,580
Speaker 1: Oh there were actually two other transformers.

708
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:26,982
Speaker 1: things in here.

709
00:44:27,384 --> 00:44:28,850
Speaker 0: There's I tossed this one away.

710
00:44:29,352 --> 00:44:41,095
Speaker 1: Oh this transformers storm bringer in the middle here Which actually looks like more of a real transformer store you got like a group of Autobots going to Cybertron Which has been long abandoned.

711
00:44:41,155 --> 00:44:50,279
Speaker 1: so this seems like a continuation like actually in the Transformers storyline but far in the future from any transformers that I've ever seen.

712
00:44:50,299 --> 00:44:53,589
Speaker 1: and Yes, what's his name?

713
00:44:55,432 --> 00:44:56,919
Speaker 1: What's the guy's name Sunfire?

714
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:58,306
Speaker 1: I think I don't fire.

715
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:02,637
Speaker 1: Yeah, jet fire the giant Valkyrie guy.

716
00:45:03,139 --> 00:45:07,470
Speaker 1: He's there which is a plus for Scott and then he couldn't even remember his name.

717
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:09,778
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know what he looks like.

718
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:22,502
Speaker 1: and then there are two pages of a preview of Transformers evolutions, which I don't know how good a comic it's gonna be but it has steampunk style transformers That's worth buying.

719
00:45:22,602 --> 00:45:23,389
Speaker 1: one issue right there.

720
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:31,485
Speaker 0: Yep, basically anything that has steampunk air pirates or pirates in it We'll probably give it a chance got bumblebee, and it looks like he transformed.

721
00:45:31,525 --> 00:45:34,640
Speaker 1: It looks like Transformers plus kitchen core.

722
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:38,574
Speaker 1: that's exactly what this is in visual Visual styling.

723
00:45:38,956 --> 00:45:40,442
Speaker 1: so I might get one issue with that.

724
00:45:40,563 --> 00:45:42,250
Speaker 1: I got one issue of the infiltration.

725
00:45:42,351 --> 00:45:42,874
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.

726
00:45:42,914 --> 00:45:45,269
Speaker 1: maybe I have an issue of some transformers by these guys.

727
00:45:46,054 --> 00:45:48,406
Speaker 1: I don't know which one it is, but I didn't have.

728
00:45:48,466 --> 00:45:49,250
Speaker 1: is he didn't buy any more?

729
00:45:51,194 --> 00:45:52,649
Speaker 0: All right x-men runaways.

730
00:45:53,551 --> 00:45:57,510
Speaker 1: Well, I read runaways and I read x-men when I was a kid, but not recently.

731
00:45:57,610 --> 00:45:58,715
Speaker 1: But I read runaways.

732
00:45:58,775 --> 00:46:02,530
Speaker 1: at least the first five trade paperbacks and runaways is really really good.

733
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:03,854
Speaker 1: You should read it now.

734
00:46:04,015 --> 00:46:04,657
Speaker 0: I hadn't read it.

735
00:46:04,877 --> 00:46:08,670
Speaker 0: All I read was this and from this it looked like runaways is crap.

736
00:46:09,531 --> 00:46:21,305
Speaker 1: Well, it's this is written by the same guy who wrote runaways, but it's sort of like this 10 page Short story meant to introduce you into I don't know it didn't introduce you media anything.

737
00:46:21,566 --> 00:46:24,495
Speaker 0: it introduced all these normal dudes Who were actually mutants.

738
00:46:24,736 --> 00:46:28,130
Speaker 0: and then the x-men came and then they fought and only one of them's a mutant.

739
00:46:29,111 --> 00:46:31,299
Speaker 0: But they all had powers or some their powers.

740
00:46:31,339 --> 00:46:33,587
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they only one of those a mutant whatever.

741
00:46:33,627 --> 00:46:34,510
Speaker 0: they all had powers.

742
00:46:35,193 --> 00:46:38,770
Speaker 1: There was nothing to it as they actually what some of them don't have so many powers.

743
00:46:39,834 --> 00:46:40,968
Speaker 0: They still held the x-men off.

744
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:42,194
Speaker 1: Yeah, they did.

745
00:46:42,274 --> 00:46:43,098
Speaker 1: they they sure did.

746
00:46:44,021 --> 00:46:47,445
Speaker 0: and the one thing that bothered me is the way it was drawn Wolverine.

747
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:53,110
Speaker 0: Whenever you see him, his mouth is wide open with these big teeth and he's snowed.

748
00:46:53,110 --> 00:47:02,910
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah It totally bugs the hell out of me like there's two panels where there are two different panels on the same page Where he has the exact same expression on his face, even though his body is in a different position.

749
00:47:04,733 --> 00:47:05,336
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

750
00:47:05,436 --> 00:47:07,726
Speaker 1: and it's like why does kitty pride have a dragon?

751
00:47:07,746 --> 00:47:08,569
Speaker 1: and why all right?

752
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:17,925
Speaker 0: I was about to say the only saving grace of this was that one kitty pride is in it because I kitty pride is awesome Yeah, and two kitty pride has a frickin dragon and that's awesome.

753
00:47:17,945 --> 00:47:20,434
Speaker 0: I don't know why she has a dragon I don't know, but I like the dragon.

754
00:47:20,454 --> 00:47:20,756
Speaker 0: He's cute.

755
00:47:21,037 --> 00:47:24,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think this is just written because it's so short.

756
00:47:24,431 --> 00:47:26,083
Speaker 1: The guy just kind of wrote it really quick.

757
00:47:26,103 --> 00:47:28,636
Speaker 0: Like yeah, it's good enough It has a dinosaur in it.

758
00:47:29,238 --> 00:47:33,674
Speaker 1: The dinosaur is actually part of runaways and it's why it's not that stupid Alright.

759
00:47:34,077 --> 00:47:35,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, they drew the Beast a lot like a monkey.

760
00:47:36,611 --> 00:47:39,323
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Beast looks sort of like a monkey.

761
00:47:39,343 --> 00:47:44,803
Speaker 0: seriously the only I Runaways, it better be damn good because runaways is damn good.

762
00:47:44,823 --> 00:47:46,250
Speaker 1: This is nothing like runaways.

763
00:47:46,411 --> 00:47:47,655
Speaker 0: So why is this called run away?

764
00:47:47,675 --> 00:47:49,060
Speaker 1: because it has those characters.

765
00:47:49,642 --> 00:47:50,987
Speaker 0: those characters are a runaways.

766
00:47:51,028 --> 00:47:51,670
Speaker 0: Tell me they're different.

767
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:53,074
Speaker 1: Those are the runaways.

768
00:47:53,115 --> 00:47:55,703
Speaker 0: Tell me they they have different personalities or something.

769
00:47:56,044 --> 00:47:59,635
Speaker 1: Well here they don't seem to have personalities And runaways they do.

770
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:02,605
Speaker 0: they just each one of them whips off a one-liner.

771
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,009
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's about it.

772
00:48:05,013 --> 00:48:07,444
Speaker 0: But once again two pluses kitty pride.

773
00:48:07,565 --> 00:48:09,753
Speaker 0: and kitty pride has a dragon All right on her shoulder.

774
00:48:09,874 --> 00:48:13,506
Speaker 1: after it comes Franklin Richards, which actually is pretty good.

775
00:48:13,526 --> 00:48:15,555
Speaker 0: It was alright I wasn't really.

776
00:48:15,575 --> 00:48:16,703
Speaker 1: I thought it was really funny.

777
00:48:16,723 --> 00:48:21,690
Speaker 0: I Really didn't know now wasn't anything special or new or interesting.

778
00:48:22,173 --> 00:48:24,385
Speaker 1: I thought it was funny and cute like a little.

779
00:48:24,426 --> 00:48:28,204
Speaker 1: you know that You know a little comic where you see the little kid and you imagine stuff.

780
00:48:28,245 --> 00:48:31,977
Speaker 0: and then yeah It just didn't make me chuckle at all.

781
00:48:31,997 --> 00:48:36,610
Speaker 1: yeah, it wasn't chuckle like haha, that's hilarious like simply good Simpsons.

782
00:48:36,731 --> 00:48:37,735
Speaker 0: I didn't even crack a smile.

783
00:48:37,775 --> 00:48:39,502
Speaker 0: I just read it and then I kept going.

784
00:48:39,522 --> 00:48:42,032
Speaker 0: yeah, I don't know I just didn't like it.

785
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:43,296
Speaker 1: I think it's cute.

786
00:48:43,497 --> 00:48:44,680
Speaker 1: Especially since it's like.

787
00:48:45,082 --> 00:48:47,609
Speaker 1: you know they draw a guy and obviously dr.

788
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:48,928
Speaker 1: Doom, but it's not.

789
00:48:49,771 --> 00:48:50,515
Speaker 1: It's like haha.

790
00:48:50,535 --> 00:48:51,922
Speaker 1: We're making fun of ourselves.

791
00:48:52,002 --> 00:48:52,484
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

792
00:48:52,504 --> 00:48:55,616
Speaker 0: I don't even notice that I don't read comics.

793
00:48:55,636 --> 00:48:59,792
Speaker 1: I don't know any of those people come on you look on like the last page of it And it's like okay.

794
00:48:59,832 --> 00:49:04,809
Speaker 1: There's the Hulk and this Captain America, and there's a guy who looks like Batman, and this is generic girl.

795
00:49:05,252 --> 00:49:05,675
Speaker 0: Yeah, dr.

796
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:07,147
Speaker 1: Doom is all tied up.

797
00:49:07,993 --> 00:49:11,050
Speaker 1: Whatever, did you read the Marvel adventures Avengers?

798
00:49:11,873 --> 00:49:12,346
Speaker 0: Civil War?

799
00:49:13,251 --> 00:49:15,078
Speaker 1: No, no, no just turn go to Freddy.

800
00:49:15,379 --> 00:49:16,584
Speaker 1: Oh, that's the SN ad.

801
00:49:17,065 --> 00:49:17,708
Speaker 1: turn the page.

802
00:49:18,109 --> 00:49:18,794
Speaker 0: yeah I did that.

803
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:22,657
Speaker 0: that was all right for a second Because I don't know what's going on.

804
00:49:22,698 --> 00:49:23,621
Speaker 1: Civil War is an ad.

805
00:49:23,943 --> 00:49:32,230
Speaker 0: I was sky I was skimming this and The first thing I thought on the second page of all the third page of it is why is spider-man a tiny little dude?

806
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:33,293
Speaker 0: Did he get transformed?

807
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:36,566
Speaker 0: and then I read the text is like oh, that's a giant okay?

808
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:40,065
Speaker 1: Yeah, giant girl I don't know about giant girl.

809
00:49:40,085 --> 00:49:40,549
Speaker 1: Don't ask me.

810
00:49:42,091 --> 00:49:44,440
Speaker 1: But yeah Marvel adventures comics.

811
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:55,345
Speaker 1: whenever you go to the comic store if you go to the comic store And you see something like spider-man adventures or cats in America adventures Those aren't read those aren't quote.

812
00:49:55,707 --> 00:49:57,693
Speaker 1: real Comics that are.

813
00:49:57,733 --> 00:50:00,945
Speaker 1: you know in the real story that all the comics are in.

814
00:50:01,045 --> 00:50:01,908
Speaker 0: so they're not canon.

815
00:50:02,309 --> 00:50:03,916
Speaker 1: yeah They're like separate.

816
00:50:04,197 --> 00:50:17,910
Speaker 1: You know story kids comics type things and often They're actually a lot better than the real comics because they're just telling good stories or Attempting to just tell good stories with the characters and not make some giant continuity laden crap.

817
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:29,904
Speaker 0: the only good thing about this is that spider-man and the giant girl talk about pirates and Spider-man has a pirate sword that he's made out of his webs that he's carrying.

818
00:50:29,924 --> 00:50:31,368
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't even notice that.

819
00:50:31,468 --> 00:50:33,458
Speaker 0: oh my god That's the only thing I got out of this.

820
00:50:33,478 --> 00:50:34,202
Speaker 1: That's awesome.

821
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:35,267
Speaker 0: It's right there.

822
00:50:35,307 --> 00:50:35,770
Speaker 0: He's holding it.

823
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:39,070
Speaker 0: He's like a vast matey no cannons blah blah blah.

824
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:52,129
Speaker 1: That's why I kind of like spider-man comics more than other superheroes because while most of the comic is the same as any other Superhero comic spider-man is constantly making wisecracks and jokes and all that kind of shit.

825
00:50:52,752 --> 00:50:54,739
Speaker 1: Deadpool is the same way Deadpool.

826
00:50:54,759 --> 00:50:57,810
Speaker 1: You know he just constantly saying assholish things and whatnot.

827
00:50:59,032 --> 00:51:02,226
Speaker 0: No, I actually the ultimate spider-man saga thing was kind of interesting.

828
00:51:02,246 --> 00:51:02,929
Speaker 1: Oh, did you read it?

829
00:51:03,049 --> 00:51:03,170
Speaker 0: Yeah?

830
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:03,511
Speaker 0: I read it.

831
00:51:03,652 --> 00:51:13,030
Speaker 1: all it does is summarize everything that's happened in ultimate spider-man So that if you decide you want to read ultimate spider-man you're now caught up so you can buy the latest issue.

832
00:51:13,392 --> 00:51:16,871
Speaker 0: I don't know how good the comic is but the summary made it sound kind of good I guess.

833
00:51:17,072 --> 00:51:19,801
Speaker 1: well because the ultimate comics from Marvel.

834
00:51:19,841 --> 00:51:24,439
Speaker 1: what they did is they said all right a lot of people don't know what the Hell's going on in the real Marvel comics.

835
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:32,730
Speaker 1: We're gonna create a whole separate You know universe with its own separate continuity, and we're just gonna call the ultimate universe.

836
00:51:32,891 --> 00:51:43,530
Speaker 1: And they started over you know basically from scratch and just called everything ultimate And you'll notice if you know the real original spider-man story that this one is crook slightly different.

837
00:51:44,051 --> 00:51:46,377
Speaker 1: Yeah, like in the original spider-man.

838
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:51,550
Speaker 1: It's mostly this is more like what happened in the movie and less like what happened originally.

839
00:51:53,453 --> 00:51:56,310
Speaker 0: You know I do note that once again kitty pride.

840
00:51:57,351 --> 00:51:58,936
Speaker 1: Yeah, really where all right?

841
00:51:59,257 --> 00:52:02,327
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was kind of weird cuz I like kitty pride.

842
00:52:02,367 --> 00:52:09,090
Speaker 1: Let me go Let you go, but the thing is is that the original spider-man story is spider-man goes out with Gwen Stacy.

843
00:52:09,552 --> 00:52:12,568
Speaker 1: He fails to save her she dies spider-man goes out with Mary Jane.

844
00:52:12,608 --> 00:52:12,890
Speaker 1: the end.

845
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:17,201
Speaker 1: This one seems to be like spider-man and Mary Jane.

846
00:52:17,583 --> 00:52:26,130
Speaker 0: then Gwen Stacy shows up later And then there's conflict and then she gets axed and then spider-man dumps Mary Jane, and yeah now he's with kitty pride.

847
00:52:26,552 --> 00:52:28,762
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess that's what happens in the ultimate universe.

848
00:52:29,144 --> 00:52:30,229
Speaker 0: I'm fine with that whatever.

849
00:52:31,878 --> 00:52:38,790
Speaker 1: Yeah The other thing is in the real Marvel comic spider-man's old now, so here's a chance to read spider-man when he's young again.

850
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:40,534
Speaker 1: I guess all right.

851
00:52:40,695 --> 00:52:44,725
Speaker 0: last and least Archie is the most bland comic I've ever seen.

852
00:52:45,186 --> 00:52:49,674
Speaker 1: well at least Archie wasn't painful Like the other comics.

853
00:52:49,735 --> 00:52:54,150
Speaker 1: it was just so bland and plain and all like unoffensive.

854
00:52:55,291 --> 00:52:59,385
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's that's a perfect word for this is the most it's like.

855
00:52:59,425 --> 00:53:00,709
Speaker 1: leave it to Beaver the comic.

856
00:53:00,729 --> 00:53:04,787
Speaker 0: I Don't know who could read this and actually be amused by it.

857
00:53:05,672 --> 00:53:10,069
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know who would pay money and like be a fan of these and want to read them.

858
00:53:10,813 --> 00:53:18,888
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure by reading what I just read I've gotten every possible joke I could get out of Archie except I either wasn't a joke about Jughead eating hamburgers.

859
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:25,430
Speaker 1: Oh wait Yes, there was the thing that really bothered me about this is how like they trick you out with bullshit.

860
00:53:26,452 --> 00:53:26,833
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

861
00:53:27,094 --> 00:53:27,918
Speaker 0: They have this like?

862
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:28,440
Speaker 0: Oh?

863
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,464
Speaker 0: There's a big change.

864
00:53:29,745 --> 00:53:30,709
Speaker 0: Archie's leaving town.

865
00:53:31,134 --> 00:53:31,742
Speaker 1: Oh, no, no, no.

866
00:53:31,803 --> 00:53:32,993
Speaker 0: then at the end They're like never mind.

867
00:53:33,455 --> 00:53:36,690
Speaker 1: in the middle like Archie runs into Sabrina the Teenage Witch.

868
00:53:36,991 --> 00:53:40,605
Speaker 1: But really it's just a two-page ad for their Archie comics.

869
00:53:40,785 --> 00:53:45,350
Speaker 1: Archie comics is a publisher And they happen to print Archie comics among other comics.

870
00:53:45,932 --> 00:53:51,790
Speaker 1: So they also publish a Sabrina the Teenage Witch comic which is drawn in a manga style.

871
00:53:52,312 --> 00:54:17,066
Speaker 1: so in the middle of this Archie story Archie runs into Sabrina the Teenage Witch and acts like She's his friend and is like hey and then it's an ad for the Sabrina comic and then the next page is an ad for the Josie and the pussycats comic and Then a few pages in you've got an ad for some other comic And Betty and Veronica, which is a separate comic.

872
00:54:17,106 --> 00:54:25,350
Speaker 1: I guess It's like they just run through all their cut you know Yeah, and I gotta say then there's the actual ad for Sabrina.

873
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:31,350
Speaker 0: Wow like they must have hired someone and told them try to rip off manga, but do it shittily.

874
00:54:31,872 --> 00:54:33,296
Speaker 1: I think they just the cat's cute.

875
00:54:33,918 --> 00:54:37,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, the cat is cute, but it's cute in a very like forced way.

876
00:54:38,511 --> 00:54:43,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like they hired probably some like college or high school person who could draw manga.

877
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:48,170
Speaker 1: and No, they drew some Sabrina the Teenage Witch comics that look like manga.

878
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:49,874
Speaker 1: That's not what.

879
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:51,242
Speaker 1: that's not what sells manga.

880
00:54:51,262 --> 00:54:51,725
Speaker 1: They're stupid.

881
00:54:51,745 --> 00:54:52,449
Speaker 1: They still don't get it.

882
00:54:52,931 --> 00:54:55,242
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what sells manga having stories like Death Note.

883
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:56,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what sells them.

884
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:59,502
Speaker 0: I can't wait to hear what those comic geeks have to say about death.

885
00:54:59,723 --> 00:55:02,533
Speaker 1: one of them is already like woohoo Man.

886
00:55:02,573 --> 00:55:03,700
Speaker 0: you got to post in their forums.

887
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:03,982
Speaker 0: man.

888
00:55:04,002 --> 00:55:05,290
Speaker 0: now you got to read sanctuary.

889
00:55:05,631 --> 00:55:06,816
Speaker 1: Yeah, thanks is.

890
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:10,430
Speaker 1: the problem is not everyone can get sanctuary, so it's hard to get people to read it.

891
00:55:10,731 --> 00:55:16,210
Speaker 1: It's much easier to say hey read something like monster read you know and Akira is too expensive.

892
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:22,848
Speaker 1: so it's hard to get people to read that and Phoenix isn't easily available even though it's in print so it's hard to give people to read that.

893
00:55:22,868 --> 00:55:33,809
Speaker 1: yeah you know it's like all the great manga because they print the shoujo manga like nothing but The older really good manga they don't print so much of so it's really hard to get more people to read it.

894
00:55:34,332 --> 00:55:37,550
Speaker 1: The other thing is manga is starting to even out where they're really good.

895
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:42,668
Speaker 1: Manga is selling more and more titles and the crap manga is selling less and less type.

896
00:55:42,688 --> 00:55:45,249
Speaker 0: You know copies Yeah, we'll see how much Cantarella sells.

897
00:55:45,743 --> 00:55:47,494
Speaker 1: Yeah So a manga.

898
00:55:47,855 --> 00:55:55,319
Speaker 1: it's getting to the point where manga like FMA and Death Note our chart and fruits basket are starting to sell Way more copies than they used to.

899
00:55:55,540 --> 00:56:03,190
Speaker 1: like bestseller list copy yeah But Tokyo pop random shoujo is selling fewer copies, so it's becoming less worth it to do that.

900
00:56:03,671 --> 00:56:16,290
Speaker 1: So now people are probably gonna be start getting more discriminative about what manga they license and publish Trying to only sell you know publish manga that are really good not just any old crap because it's gonna sell enough.

901
00:56:16,711 --> 00:56:24,112
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I know Tokyo pop does a lot of market research because they they seem to see what is popular at conventions and go With that.

902
00:56:24,213 --> 00:56:27,610
Speaker 1: yep, but Viz seems to be really pooning everyone.

903
00:56:28,112 --> 00:56:31,810
Speaker 1: I mean you know I looked at it for a while, and it was like in the original days.

904
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:35,490
Speaker 1: It was Viz and then Tokyo pop came and blew everyone away.

905
00:56:35,691 --> 00:56:42,570
Speaker 0: Well it seems like whenever the Tokyo pop people are doing something at a con The only people who are reacting to what they're doing are they screechy?

906
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:54,482
Speaker 0: Fan girls mm-hmm, so that's I wonder if it's like this cycle where the people they talk to her fangirls And then the research they get back from them is fangirl stuff And then they make fangirl stuff, and it just it's a feedback loop.

907
00:56:55,165 --> 00:56:56,109
Speaker 1: I guess I don't know.

908
00:56:58,677 --> 00:57:03,186
Speaker 0: I Maybe why don't we ask him we could yeah, Oh believe me when Otakon comes.

909
00:57:03,226 --> 00:57:04,150
Speaker 0: They'll be interviews.

910
00:57:04,935 --> 00:57:08,491
Speaker 1: Yeah, like Tokyo pop should really I Mean?

911
00:57:08,953 --> 00:57:10,759
Speaker 1: they need to go out and figure.

912
00:57:10,879 --> 00:57:13,227
Speaker 1: I could tell them what the popular manga is.

913
00:57:13,267 --> 00:57:14,653
Speaker 1: they should bring over What.

914
00:57:14,774 --> 00:57:16,989
Speaker 1: what's the the best anime right now?

915
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:20,238
Speaker 1: Right now is there an ergo proxy manga.

916
00:57:20,579 --> 00:57:23,888
Speaker 1: I have no idea they can get the mushishi manga that would freakin sell.

917
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:27,320
Speaker 1: yeah I know that's been licensed or not.

918
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:30,250
Speaker 1: whether manga could they go grab that would sell big.

919
00:57:30,812 --> 00:57:31,454
Speaker 0: I really don't know.

920
00:57:31,475 --> 00:57:32,238
Speaker 0: that's the problem.

921
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:42,801
Speaker 0: I can tell you I know anime left and right I don't know manga anymore because all the manga that I thought oh that manga is awesome I've got or read or I'm planning to read already.

922
00:57:42,821 --> 00:57:47,349
Speaker 0: Yeah, or I can't get it Like the end of Death Note.

923
00:57:49,015 --> 00:57:51,834
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah It's coming out fast enough.

924
00:57:52,356 --> 00:58:00,965
Speaker 1: the real problem with manga is that you know the the American publisher eventually catches up with a Japanese Publisher and then you're stuck waiting forever to get the next volume.

925
00:58:01,046 --> 00:58:01,830
Speaker 1: It's sort of annoying.

926
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:11,492
Speaker 0: Yeah, unless you just wait and then read the American releases Read just enough of the scans lations to know what to know that you're gonna like it and then just hold out for the real One.

927
00:58:11,733 --> 00:58:12,539
Speaker 1: no, that's what I'm saying.

928
00:58:12,579 --> 00:58:16,840
Speaker 1: is that with the real one like Death Note We're gonna get like in rapid succession.

929
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,189
Speaker 1: the first like I think there's ten.

930
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:21,573
Speaker 1: Well, that's no bonds now.

931
00:58:21,593 --> 00:58:23,196
Speaker 0: That's no it's not gonna go that much longer.

932
00:58:23,497 --> 00:58:27,650
Speaker 1: So yeah, but I mean Excel saga is a good example.

933
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:34,510
Speaker 1: They put out a billion volumes of Excel saga and now the people who bought all those volumes Cell saga is not done.

934
00:58:34,530 --> 00:58:37,410
Speaker 1: They're gonna have to wait months and months and months and months for the next volume.

935
00:58:37,691 --> 00:58:43,250
Speaker 0: Maybe they should I don't know stagger the releases a little more because then people say hey so much of this is out.

936
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:45,570
Speaker 1: Why don't you hurry up and give me what's already out, you know?

937
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:49,610
Speaker 0: But then if they put it all out people say hey there hasn't been one for X months and now we're pissed.

938
00:58:49,871 --> 00:58:51,366
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can't win with these people.

939
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:52,451
Speaker 1: No No You can't.

940
00:58:52,512 --> 00:59:03,543
Speaker 1: what you need to do is need to just take shown and jump and all those other magazines and just directly Translate them maybe with a weak delay or a two-week delay Maybe in a month delay and just bring them over here.

941
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:04,025
Speaker 1: direct.

942
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:04,990
Speaker 1: replace the ads.

943
00:59:05,331 --> 00:59:07,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just wonder how much of a mass market there is currently.

944
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:12,094
Speaker 1: the trick with that is you have to put it on magazine Racks everywhere.

945
00:59:12,415 --> 00:59:15,425
Speaker 1: You can't do this wussy thing where you barely publish it.

946
00:59:15,645 --> 00:59:16,930
Speaker 1: You need to get a pile of money.

947
00:59:18,331 --> 00:59:20,239
Speaker 0: You've said this on the show a bunch of time have I?

948
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:21,203
Speaker 0: and we've gone long.

949
00:59:21,243 --> 00:59:22,750
Speaker 0: so we'll do a whole episode on that.

950
00:59:22,770 --> 00:59:24,380
Speaker 1: All right, you advertise the fuck out of it.

951
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,487
Speaker 1: So you keep saying everywhere.

952
00:59:25,507 --> 00:59:28,443
Speaker 0: Yeah Cuz we've already gone long have we?

953
00:59:28,624 --> 00:59:28,945
Speaker 1: yeah.

954
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:32,904
Speaker 0: All right Yeah, and in the end free comic book day was kind of a bust.

955
00:59:33,426 --> 00:59:34,029
Speaker 1: at least they're free.

956
00:59:34,732 --> 00:59:35,354
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're free.

957
00:59:35,394 --> 00:59:41,194
Speaker 0: pretty good for free if they're if the goal of free comic book day is to get new people to read comics I think they failed.

958
00:59:41,515 --> 00:59:44,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean look at the Simpsons comic targeting comic people.

959
00:59:46,491 --> 00:59:53,610
Speaker 1: Hello if you want to get new people to read comics first of all Give the free comics out somewhere besides a comic book store.

960
00:59:53,610 --> 00:59:56,942
Speaker 0: Yeah The only people who go to a comic book store are people who buy comics.

961
00:59:57,102 --> 01:00:00,390
Speaker 1: any only people know about free comic book day are People who buy comics anyway.

962
01:00:00,691 --> 01:00:06,350
Speaker 0: I don't think any of the people in the city of Newburgh even know that comic book store is there except comic book nerds.

963
01:00:06,772 --> 01:00:09,925
Speaker 0: They probably just see that door and never even think that there's something behind.

964
01:00:09,945 --> 01:00:11,110
Speaker 1: but there's a sign above it.

965
01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:12,682
Speaker 0: But they brought even see the side.

966
01:00:12,702 --> 01:00:13,610
Speaker 1: if I just ignore it.

967
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:17,670
Speaker 0: They don't care cuz the store is pretty scary and dark and grimy inside.

968
01:00:18,012 --> 01:00:21,227
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you want to get new people to read comics have free comic book day.

969
01:00:21,287 --> 01:00:21,468
Speaker 1: Sure.

970
01:00:21,508 --> 01:00:21,890
Speaker 1: It's great.

971
01:00:22,291 --> 01:00:25,003
Speaker 1: Put the free comics in the fucking grocery store.

972
01:00:25,143 --> 01:00:26,649
Speaker 0: Oh and have good comics.

973
01:00:27,191 --> 01:00:28,958
Speaker 1: Yeah, even these comics would have done.

974
01:00:28,998 --> 01:00:31,406
Speaker 1: Okay in the grocery store better than the comic store.

975
01:00:31,426 --> 01:00:32,430
Speaker 0: Well, look free comic book day.

976
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:36,989
Speaker 0: It happens once a year right and every publisher puts out one crap little normal comic.

977
01:00:37,792 --> 01:00:44,708
Speaker 0: Tokyo pop Constantly constantly constantly puts out giant-ass manga full of previews high quality.

978
01:00:44,728 --> 01:00:45,993
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Just free.

979
01:00:46,053 --> 01:00:49,510
Speaker 1: they give them away everywhere like conventions and all kinds of stuff.

980
01:00:49,844 --> 01:00:56,534
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean I remember when we had there were a bunch left over at a con or something and they gave us a frickin crate of those Sneak things.

981
01:00:56,574 --> 01:00:58,706
Speaker 0: they said oh just give them away or whatever you want to do with them.

982
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:01,094
Speaker 0: Yep Why don't the comic?

983
01:01:01,234 --> 01:01:03,664
Speaker 0: why don't the comic people just pay more and do something good like that?

984
01:01:03,684 --> 01:01:08,493
Speaker 1: Tokyo pop has that free magazine - oh, yeah, Takuhai Yeah, that's it.

985
01:01:09,255 --> 01:01:14,450
Speaker 1: You you sign up for it and they send you what's basically a little magazine every once in a while.

986
01:01:14,895 --> 01:01:21,589
Speaker 1: I think it's me for a year I'm not sure and it's got a whole bunch of manga in it And of course a whole bunch of Tokyo pop ads.

987
01:01:21,851 --> 01:01:30,367
Speaker 0: the only reason I didn't sign up for it was that they really Aggressively marketed it and pushed it and the more people market things the less I am willing to do them.

988
01:01:30,527 --> 01:01:32,536
Speaker 0: if especially since then They'll probably just spam me.

989
01:01:32,737 --> 01:01:35,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, it really felt like it was a spam deal.

990
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:36,436
Speaker 1: I mean the thing itself they get.

991
01:01:36,456 --> 01:01:37,802
Speaker 1: they had free ones at Otakon.

992
01:01:37,823 --> 01:01:45,810
Speaker 1: I picked one up and It seemed like it was a span ad, you know, it didn't have a whole bunch of manga in it.

993
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:51,478
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess I'm just resentful of that sort of thing because I get enough junk mail as it is Mm-hmm.

994
01:01:51,498 --> 01:01:56,558
Speaker 1: So if you're looking to read some comics Don't read these comics.

997
01:02:06,251 --> 01:02:09,925
Speaker 0: You know all the independent comics and I'll know that people in our forums have the same sentiment.

998
01:02:10,206 --> 01:02:10,387
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

1006
01:02:35,798 --> 01:02:36,509
Speaker 1: What does that say?

1007
01:02:37,570 --> 01:02:38,174
Speaker 1: that's another thing.

1008
01:02:38,235 --> 01:02:49,117
Speaker 1: all these comics are meant for like kids and most comics in the comic store are not meant for kids and Kids don't really go to the comic store or read comics.

1009
01:02:49,137 --> 01:02:50,361
Speaker 0: these kids don't read comics.
