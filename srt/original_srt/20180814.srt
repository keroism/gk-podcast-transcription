1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,392
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday August 14th 2018.

2
00:00:12,392 --> 00:00:17,177
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight handicapping in games.

3
00:00:19,301 --> 00:00:20,318
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:21,483 --> 00:00:23,580
Speaker 1: So a big ol thunderstorm came through New York.

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:29,040
Speaker 1: So once you have to deal with the situation here on the subway where like you come on the tunnel is Viking.

6
00:00:29,783 --> 00:00:33,120
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I took the subway because it was crazy humid and I wore suit today.

7
00:00:33,845 --> 00:00:41,620
Speaker 1: but I'm on the subway and Pretty much every cell phone on the subway car starts making the hey, there's a flash flood alert sound.

8
00:00:41,943 --> 00:00:43,336
Speaker 0: Yeah, everyone just fucking ignores this.

9
00:00:43,457 --> 00:00:47,674
Speaker 0: one day It's gonna say hey actual emergency and they don't have a higher alert level to go to.

10
00:00:47,995 --> 00:00:49,360
Speaker 0: so there is one higher alert.

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,165
Speaker 0: There's stupid wolf crying now.

12
00:00:51,205 --> 00:00:54,935
Speaker 1: So honestly, I'm fine with the flash flood alerts because they're.

13
00:00:55,176 --> 00:00:59,180
Speaker 0: I've seen flash floods over there Yeah, but they're not flash floods like in the desert.

14
00:00:59,802 --> 00:01:06,870
Speaker 1: Well now but I mean a tornado crazy like f4 tornado While that's bigger and scarier than like a tiny tornado.

15
00:01:07,332 --> 00:01:09,419
Speaker 1: tiny tornado still kills you if it hits your house.

16
00:01:09,863 --> 00:01:11,740
Speaker 0: Sure, don't get hit by tornado.

17
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:16,634
Speaker 1: but the scary thing I didn't realize this was a problem and it's really sad to me that it's a problem.

18
00:01:16,654 --> 00:01:28,720
Speaker 1: apparently the weather service is really working on Changing the nomenclature around these alerts because most Americans do not understand even the simplest weather alerts.

19
00:01:28,861 --> 00:01:31,653
Speaker 0: It's not like anyone teaches people you just I was taught.

20
00:01:31,713 --> 00:01:33,280
Speaker 1: I was taught this in elementary school.

21
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:34,343
Speaker 0: No, they never taught us.

22
00:01:34,424 --> 00:01:35,768
Speaker 1: I figured we literally took a class.

23
00:01:35,788 --> 00:01:38,256
Speaker 1: I'm like tornado watch tornado warning.

24
00:01:38,356 --> 00:01:39,620
Speaker 1: No, what is a flash flood?

25
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,810
Speaker 0: No, I figured it out all based on common sense.

26
00:01:42,131 --> 00:01:43,940
Speaker 1: Well, yes, but here this that's what bothers me.

27
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:57,540
Speaker 1: I was taught it but it is trivial to figure out from common sense and it's weird to me that there are people adults functioning in society who are Unclear on the difference between a tornado watch and a tornado warning.

28
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,680
Speaker 0: So basically any weather in the United States any weather related thing?

29
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,350
Speaker 0: That's a watch means the conditions are ripe.

30
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,655
Speaker 0: This thing could happen.

31
00:02:04,735 --> 00:02:05,980
Speaker 0: warning means it's fucking.

32
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:14,080
Speaker 1: Fart watch is when rim ate a whole bunch of leafy greens and a whole bunch of bullshit and his stomach is rumbling.

33
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,124
Speaker 1: Yeah, my stomach's rumbling.

34
00:02:15,445 --> 00:02:18,436
Speaker 1: fart warning is after the first person has smelt it.

35
00:02:18,637 --> 00:02:31,265
Speaker 0: Yes I Warning means I. I just heard up and I called it in the weather station has a microphone on it and the Noise was detected.

36
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:35,560
Speaker 1: but fart watch means like so just so you know, like if you see rim in the room.

37
00:02:36,044 --> 00:02:37,299
Speaker 1: You don't have to flee yet.

38
00:02:37,721 --> 00:02:38,785
Speaker 1: But keep an eye out.

39
00:02:38,905 --> 00:02:48,350
Speaker 0: you see right you're in a room and you see a rim and you see a bowl and you see an empty can of beans Empty Like what you eat today.

40
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:52,839
Speaker 0: 400 granola bars Ten Rico lines.

41
00:02:54,963 --> 00:02:56,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, fucking okay.

42
00:02:56,921 --> 00:03:07,560
Speaker 1: the only other thing cuz we're gonna talk about cons cuz a bunch of packs announcements just happen if you ever notice that you get really farty at conventions and Your throat hurts because it's a dry ass convention center.

43
00:03:07,861 --> 00:03:12,318
Speaker 1: So as a result, you're eating a lot of cough drops, guess what cough drops cause farting?

44
00:03:13,302 --> 00:03:14,947
Speaker 1: The pectin in case you didn't know.

45
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:19,119
Speaker 1: I learned that terrible lesson and it does not stop me from using cough drops.

46
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,570
Speaker 1: now I just know why I'm farting.

47
00:03:21,175 --> 00:03:26,660
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Or you psycho semantically fart more when eating cough drops because you've learned this information.

48
00:03:27,626 --> 00:03:30,150
Speaker 1: but you too you too.

49
00:03:31,606 --> 00:03:38,200
Speaker 1: so in the news, uh Pax West which is coming up pretty soon like too soon two weeks.

50
00:03:38,902 --> 00:03:43,780
Speaker 1: I still gotta like rewrite I gotta update the panel at least all my flights like everything's sorted out.

51
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:47,917
Speaker 1: We're set but they announced way later than usual.

52
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,733
Speaker 1: the keynote At least I feels like it's way later.

53
00:03:50,753 --> 00:03:55,030
Speaker 0: I don't actually have data Yeah, but it just feels like they announced it later than they used to.

54
00:03:55,171 --> 00:03:57,920
Speaker 0: but even though it may not be the case

55
00:03:58,281 --> 00:04:08,170
Speaker 1: though what I can say is that as someone who has presented that literally ever every packs I've ever gone to and I've gone to every packs except two of the packs Australia's

56
00:04:08,972 --> 00:04:10,938
Speaker 0: and packs seven and oh,

57
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:15,274
Speaker 1: yeah and before 2008 which there are not that many of four

58
00:04:15,294 --> 00:04:16,238
Speaker 0: or five six and seven.

59
00:04:16,499 --> 00:04:26,560
Speaker 1: but One thing I have noticed is that the packs Selection process for panels has gotten closer and closer to packs as time has gone on like significantly.

60
00:04:26,881 --> 00:04:35,646
Speaker 1: So like I'll get the panel acceptance emails way way way way later than we used to and I don't know why I don't really Care that much, but it's something I've noticed.

61
00:04:35,968 --> 00:04:46,739
Speaker 1: But anyway, the packs West keynote speaker probably will be pretty good because it is the game director of Ba of work with Warcraft World of Warcraft.

62
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:54,800
Speaker 1: Yes I'm looking at the tweet So I was trying to part because it's just game director of at Warcraft at at Blizzard and there were three ads in a row.

63
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,235
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it's World of Warcraft and not Warcraft the RTS, right?

64
00:04:58,938 --> 00:05:08,460
Speaker 1: I assume so I don't know a lot about that side of Blizzard because I don't play any of those games as I did hear rumors of like Warcraft the RTS making a comeback, but I'm pretty sure it's about World of Warcraft.

65
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:11,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, so battle for Azeroth and all that stuff is coming.

66
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,409
Speaker 1: But basically Ian has a cost.

67
00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:17,325
Speaker 1: us is going to be the keynote speaker Which probably gonna be worth.

68
00:05:17,345 --> 00:05:20,776
Speaker 0: the battle of Azeroth is the seventh expansion for World of Warcraft.

69
00:05:20,856 --> 00:05:21,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

70
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:26,503
Speaker 0: So it was announced for Blizzcon in 2017.

71
00:05:26,503 --> 00:05:32,800
Speaker 1: right because I will admit that There's a lot of the recent packs keynotes have been more missed than hit but a couple of them.

72
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,756
Speaker 0: I think it comes out like friggin today.

73
00:05:34,837 --> 00:05:37,075
Speaker 1: Yeah Not that I'm going to play it.

74
00:05:37,116 --> 00:05:37,600
Speaker 1: I know better.

75
00:05:38,182 --> 00:05:39,607
Speaker 0: Why would I play World of Warcraft?

76
00:05:39,747 --> 00:05:42,196
Speaker 0: expect raise the level cap from 110 to 120 and I'm gonna be level one.

77
00:05:47,422 --> 00:05:55,531
Speaker 0: But yeah, so the thing is usually when someone from a big game studio does the packs keynote They're gonna announce something and it's just an ad goddess.

78
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:58,080
Speaker 0: So I noticed I'm pretty sure this is true.

79
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:05,605
Speaker 0: I read it when one place only is that it used to be that you would get Wow and you get a Wow account but you would have to buy these expansions.

80
00:06:05,646 --> 00:06:14,060
Speaker 0: that would add like you couldn't go to the places to do like say, you know, the Frozen Thrones if you didn't buy the frozen throne?

81
00:06:14,401 --> 00:06:18,773
Speaker 1: It makes sense because as much as you want a game company just keep expanding things forever.

82
00:06:19,195 --> 00:06:22,920
Speaker 1: unless they can monetize that work It just cost them money.

83
00:06:23,321 --> 00:06:28,359
Speaker 0: Mean Wow is a subscription game, but you had to buy these expansions in addition to paying the subscription for.

84
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:36,320
Speaker 0: well But it seems like now if you make a Wow account They give you every single expansion ever except for the battle for Azeroth that you got to buy.

85
00:06:36,762 --> 00:06:44,480
Speaker 0: So I guess if you buy battle for Azeroth and then you keep and you pay the monthly fee You will have everything and you won't have to buy all those old expansions anymore.

86
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,389
Speaker 0: Yeah, so this makes me think.

87
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,620
Speaker 0: and the fact that he's doing this keynote and Wow.

88
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,486
Speaker 0: Yeah your theory right.

89
00:06:50,787 --> 00:06:54,780
Speaker 0: I'm feeling like they're gonna say he's gonna come out and be like wow is over.

90
00:06:55,042 --> 00:07:01,240
Speaker 0: this is the last expansion or We're gonna start something new Wow - or something out, right?

91
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:07,460
Speaker 0: There's gonna be a big shift in the Wow zone right and people haven't been playing MMOs for a while.

92
00:07:07,987 --> 00:07:11,086
Speaker 0: MMOs have been Sort of done as well.

93
00:07:11,106 --> 00:07:11,789
Speaker 0: There's.

94
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:16,783
Speaker 1: it seems like there still is a pretty strong core Demographic playing them.

95
00:07:17,144 --> 00:07:22,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I feel like that demographic is in clear increasingly heavily isolated from the rest of gaming discourse.

96
00:07:22,861 --> 00:07:26,660
Speaker 0: Another kind of game that's been played a lot lately are these are these ones?

97
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,268
Speaker 0: I forget what the one is called that people are playing.

98
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:33,856
Speaker 0: I installed it and almost played one mission But then didn't I just went to the main town?

99
00:07:36,401 --> 00:07:42,100
Speaker 0: The MMO is basically a game where in the town it's an MMO and then you just group up and go on.

100
00:07:42,401 --> 00:07:45,180
Speaker 0: It's like basically raids only like no world to explore.

101
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:50,928
Speaker 0: It's literally just a town and you go to the spot in the town and then it just Teleports you and your group to a mission.

102
00:07:51,109 --> 00:07:53,560
Speaker 0: So not that different from so it's sort of your land, right?

103
00:07:53,640 --> 00:08:01,666
Speaker 0: It's basically like a lobby and then you use the lobby to get teams or your guild or whatever and then you go and you Know fight a monster or something somewhere.

104
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:07,830
Speaker 1: and so the why the the MMOs I've played for more than an hour Are literally a text mud.

105
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,338
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not counting those.

106
00:08:09,378 --> 00:08:11,325
Speaker 1: I'm calling Ragnarok one.

107
00:08:11,465 --> 00:08:12,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, the realm of pirates.

108
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:19,411
Speaker 1: Here's the realm Ragnarok online puzzle pirates and I played the D&D one for almost an hour.

109
00:08:20,175 --> 00:08:22,711
Speaker 1: Oh, there was that one time We played it together and then we quit.

110
00:08:23,094 --> 00:08:23,820
Speaker 0: one time at PAX.

111
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,153
Speaker 0: They gave us a free disc in the in the in the in the swag bag.

112
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,460
Speaker 0: That was for the Lord of the Rings MMO.

113
00:08:30,846 --> 00:08:32,062
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I didn't know.

114
00:08:32,203 --> 00:08:36,380
Speaker 0: I installed it and I played it for free and I made a dwarf and I walked around it.

115
00:08:36,802 --> 00:08:41,044
Speaker 0: I I walked around some snowy places a dwarf And I know I didn't.

116
00:08:41,124 --> 00:08:45,220
Speaker 0: I hit some things with a hammer or an axe and then I uninstalled it.

117
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:49,039
Speaker 1: No, I didn't play it but I did play the D&D one and I remember the.

118
00:08:50,022 --> 00:08:59,793
Speaker 1: The immediate problem was that I think we've tried to play together and I was standing in a spot in town And I said I'm there and you said you were also there and it turned out.

119
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:03,869
Speaker 1: the town was just sharted and we couldn't actually Meet each other and then we just kind of quit.

120
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:04,431
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

121
00:09:04,994 --> 00:09:05,918
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't like MMOs.

122
00:09:07,141 --> 00:09:11,260
Speaker 1: Anyway in some other packs news packs South's dates were announced.

123
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,039
Speaker 0: I guess we got to get some hotel.

124
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,196
Speaker 1: Yeah luckily pack South remember pack South is the chill packs.

125
00:09:17,518 --> 00:09:20,989
Speaker 1: if you Cannot afford to go to the mothership packs packs.

126
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:27,720
Speaker 0: Even if you live in I guess if you live in Boston, but if you live Just far enough away from PAX East that you'll need a hotel.

127
00:09:27,841 --> 00:09:32,460
Speaker 0: So if you live in like anywhere in the Midwest you live in Western Mass you want to go to PAX East?

128
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,315
Speaker 0: You probably don't want to drive all the way down 84 every day.

129
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,025
Speaker 0: Yeah, right or whatever.

130
00:09:36,065 --> 00:09:38,857
Speaker 0: the road is the mass pike you want to right?

131
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:44,200
Speaker 0: You know stay in a hotel in Boston, which means you're going to pay PAX East hotel cost.

132
00:09:44,782 --> 00:09:52,499
Speaker 0: It would be cheaper for you to go to pack South pack South is my favorite non-west not Australia not unplugged packs.

133
00:09:54,983 --> 00:09:58,254
Speaker 1: Really all I'm saying is PAX East is the worst packs Like it is the.

134
00:09:58,294 --> 00:10:01,227
Speaker 1: yeah I like PAX East but it is of the.

135
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,798
Speaker 1: PAX is the worst in every possible regard.

136
00:10:04,878 --> 00:10:07,955
Speaker 0: at pack South The big companies are not there as much.

137
00:10:08,035 --> 00:10:08,700
Speaker 0: They're still there.

138
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean that's where Nintendo had fucking the switch and Zelda.

139
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,400
Speaker 0: They didn't have that at the other houses, right breath of the wild.

140
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,467
Speaker 0: But you had to wait in like a line to play that.

141
00:10:17,487 --> 00:10:22,044
Speaker 0: but nothing else had a line and it's way cheap and it's way Lot crowded.

142
00:10:22,084 --> 00:10:24,093
Speaker 0: So if you don't like crowds, it's the packs to go to.

143
00:10:24,113 --> 00:10:28,397
Speaker 1: there's real good cheap food Like there as opposed to paxi except on Sunday.

144
00:10:28,538 --> 00:10:31,168
Speaker 0: Yep You can just it's not.

145
00:10:31,449 --> 00:10:33,094
Speaker 0: you can always get a table and tabletop.

146
00:10:33,155 --> 00:10:34,720
Speaker 0: It's February and it's not cold.

147
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:38,660
Speaker 1: You can in fact it leans heavily tabletop because of the extra space they have.

148
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:48,420
Speaker 1: Yeah You can escape the the cold in February and in my experience The keynotes at pack South have been above average compared to the other paxis concerts above average.

149
00:10:48,521 --> 00:10:50,700
Speaker 0: It also has the super mariachi brothers.

150
00:10:50,981 --> 00:10:54,438
Speaker 0: It also has that dungeon thing that some people seem to like that Larpy.

151
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,650
Speaker 1: That's the kind of thing that really can't happen at other paxis.

152
00:10:57,731 --> 00:11:00,360
Speaker 0: Nope cannot but it still fills up like crazy.

153
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,600
Speaker 0: I think I have to make reservations for it or some shit.

154
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,919
Speaker 1: But and also for the first time ever my birthday will be at a pax.

155
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:11,873
Speaker 1: If our if our panel is on the day, that is my actual birthday.

156
00:11:12,154 --> 00:11:14,080
Speaker 1: I will have my birthday party in the panel room.

157
00:11:14,362 --> 00:11:17,923
Speaker 0: Okay, you just have your own birthday party Yeah, so

158
00:11:18,104 --> 00:11:36,460
Speaker 1: remember back when we ran kinetic on one time cuz you know smaller cons like kinetic ons turnstile is like 12,000 people maybe like nine to twelve thousand people like not a big con relative to like paxis, but Local cons get a lot of weird panel submissions like often from people who don't quite understand how panels work.

159
00:11:37,142 --> 00:11:39,209
Speaker 1: But I got a submission number of years ago.

160
00:11:39,229 --> 00:11:44,589
Speaker 1: This kid literally submitted his own ninth birthday To the panel submission.

161
00:11:44,609 --> 00:11:45,556
Speaker 0: Why didn't we accept that?

162
00:11:45,717 --> 00:11:46,079
Speaker 1: I did.

163
00:11:46,841 --> 00:11:47,968
Speaker 1: I put it on the schedule.

164
00:11:47,988 --> 00:11:49,840
Speaker 1: It was like Alex's ninth birthday party.

165
00:11:50,222 --> 00:11:52,934
Speaker 1: I put it for an hour in like a hundred person panel room.

166
00:11:52,954 --> 00:11:56,670
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm and People kept coming up and asking at our info desk.

167
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,975
Speaker 1: Like hey, I don't remember this.

168
00:11:58,156 --> 00:11:59,000
Speaker 1: you really don't remember this.

169
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,427
Speaker 1: No, I have pictures from it.

170
00:12:00,608 --> 00:12:04,455
Speaker 1: Okay, it was the kid like that we smile.

171
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:10,780
Speaker 1: in fact I had staff smuggle the cake in because they couldn't bring it up the escalators because the Convention center staff were like no outside food.

172
00:12:11,101 --> 00:12:21,409
Speaker 1: so I brought it in the elevator with my staff biz and this kid just had his birthday party and 70 people showed up to the panel Partly out of morbid curiosity.

173
00:12:21,429 --> 00:12:24,140
Speaker 1: and when it turned out it literally was this kid's birthday party.

174
00:12:24,622 --> 00:12:26,127
Speaker 1: They just totally celebrated it with him.

175
00:12:26,168 --> 00:12:26,770
Speaker 1: It was awesome.

176
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,272
Speaker 0: I wouldn't you?

177
00:12:27,432 --> 00:12:32,060
Speaker 1: yeah, so I remember this though I don't know how you don't remember things.

178
00:12:33,662 --> 00:12:37,610
Speaker 1: Anyway, we will probably see you in San Antonio in about 156 days.

179
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,557
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm gonna figure what panels to do there.

180
00:12:40,577 --> 00:12:43,204
Speaker 0: All right, so The big.

181
00:12:43,244 --> 00:12:47,477
Speaker 0: there's some gaming news because Gen Con happens a bunch of gaming news and even though we don't.

182
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:48,320
Speaker 0: we don't suggest anyone.

183
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,728
Speaker 0: Go to Gen Con unless you live real close to it.

184
00:12:50,909 --> 00:12:59,917
Speaker 0: Yeah, even professionally like we don't perform there for a reason Yeah, but they still all the tabletop companies in America announced their shit at Gen Con so day.

185
00:12:59,977 --> 00:13:01,181
Speaker 1: It'll be unplugged Right.

186
00:13:01,221 --> 00:13:13,360
Speaker 0: So one thing that actually wasn't announced at Gen Con but happened to show up in the mail Just like a week ago was yellow and Yangtze the sister game to our favorite game ever Tigris and Euphrates.

187
00:13:13,944 --> 00:13:16,300
Speaker 0: It's almost the same game only with a hex map.

188
00:13:16,722 --> 00:13:19,960
Speaker 0: But also the rules are changed to accommodate the hex map.

189
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:27,430
Speaker 0: But also the rules are changed to streamline it and they are changed in such a way where it's the same game But it's also not the same game and

190
00:13:27,651 --> 00:13:31,490
Speaker 1: we're gonna do a real full review of it later because we have to play it a lot and say

191
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,039
Speaker 0: it's sort of like cricket and baseball.

192
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:34,130
Speaker 0: you're like That's the same game.

193
00:13:34,171 --> 00:13:34,414
Speaker 0: It's like.

194
00:13:34,454 --> 00:13:34,819
Speaker 0: no, it's not.

195
00:13:36,141 --> 00:13:42,460
Speaker 1: But as you may know Tigris and Euphrates is in our opinion one of the best tabletop games ever designed.

196
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:49,060
Speaker 1: Like I cannot I cannot understate how high of an opinion I have of Tigris and Euphrates.

197
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:49,602
Speaker 0: Dr.

198
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:56,824
Speaker 0: K Rainer Knizia made Tigris and Euphrates and also made this game 15. how many years after 15 16?

199
00:13:56,824 --> 00:14:04,060
Speaker 0: Oh my god 17 years pretty sure the episode in fact.

200
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,795
Speaker 1: I think when we reviewed Tigris and Euphrates on geek nights the year was 2005, right?

201
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,414
Speaker 0: But I mean the first time you played.

202
00:14:10,454 --> 00:14:12,064
Speaker 0: it must have been 2002.

203
00:14:12,064 --> 00:14:15,395
Speaker 1: we reviewed it first because we'd already played it so much know.

204
00:14:15,415 --> 00:14:16,237
Speaker 0: when did the game come out?

205
00:14:16,257 --> 00:14:16,920
Speaker 0: go to board game game.

206
00:14:17,502 --> 00:14:18,689
Speaker 1: I'm just looking to see when we reviewed it.

207
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:30,013
Speaker 1: November 22nd 2005. we reviewed on one geek nights episode Soulcalibur 2, Tigris and Euphrates, Puerto Rico, Carcassonne and Alhambra.

208
00:14:30,173 --> 00:14:31,958
Speaker 0: So you basically just killed all the games.

209
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:37,264
Speaker 1: Yeah Well our things of the day were the Nintendo Finger assistant.

210
00:14:37,766 --> 00:14:38,871
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing that never came out.

211
00:14:39,272 --> 00:14:39,614
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

212
00:14:40,015 --> 00:14:42,052
Speaker 1: and the dangers of masturbation.

213
00:14:43,161 --> 00:14:44,508
Speaker 0: Whatever that is, you'll go blind.

214
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,056
Speaker 1: Whatever that is is gone.

215
00:14:46,076 --> 00:14:46,679
Speaker 1: You'll go blind.

216
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,887
Speaker 0: Everyone knows that.

217
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:50,377
Speaker 0: The game came out in.

218
00:14:51,761 --> 00:15:00,204
Speaker 1: It is shocking to me that radar kinesia revisited this game and put such effort into making a Sequel to it.

219
00:15:00,606 --> 00:15:10,339
Speaker 1: that is different and good But feels very much the same in terms of like the way that I process information in my brain while I play it.

220
00:15:10,721 --> 00:15:20,352
Speaker 1: It's brain feel is very similar to Tigris and Euphrates but the actual higher-order heuristics to play it and be good at it are Vastly different even on your first play.

221
00:15:20,372 --> 00:15:21,075
Speaker 0: The game came out in '97.

222
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:34,217
Speaker 0: I don't know if it came out in '97, but it won the Meeple's Choice Award in '97 And it won the deutscher spiel prize best family adult game in '98 and was recommended for the spiel de char in '98 But did not win.

223
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:39,480
Speaker 0: So it's been basically 20 years like the 20th anniversary base of abouts.

224
00:15:41,383 --> 00:15:42,711
Speaker 1: So yeah, so yeah.

225
00:15:42,751 --> 00:15:47,470
Speaker 1: well like I said we're gonna do a full review But our first impressions are it is real fun.

226
00:15:48,975 --> 00:15:51,494
Speaker 0: If you like T&E you're gonna like a game That's very similar to T&E.

227
00:15:51,880 --> 00:16:03,300
Speaker 0: Yeah And you've probably played T&E so much that even if T&E is in the end after we play both games a whole bunch Well, you already played one of them a whole bunch after you play Y&Y enough to accurately judge it.

228
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,542
Speaker 0: It may turn out that T&E is a better game But it's like.

229
00:16:05,582 --> 00:16:14,520
Speaker 0: well you've played so much T&E right and even though that game never gets old You can get even less old if you mix it up a little bit with a hex map and some different rules.

230
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:21,980
Speaker 1: But I've played T&E so much in my life And yet I still have not even bothered to use the alternate map or the extra monuments.

231
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:22,739
Speaker 0: We don't need those.

232
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:28,877
Speaker 1: I have not even like attempted to play with those because the base game is still inexhaustible.

233
00:16:29,862 --> 00:16:34,243
Speaker 1: but Yellow and Yangtze is Equivalent, but different.

234
00:16:34,384 --> 00:16:43,140
Speaker 1: like it does not replace T&E and I do believe there is value in owning both and playing Both regularly, I think they'll scratch slightly different itches.

235
00:16:43,441 --> 00:16:54,412
Speaker 1: And if I had to guess and I'm guessing because we've literally only played it once The primary difference in terms of how you approach the game Whoa Well is that we'll go in terms of like.

236
00:16:54,432 --> 00:17:02,582
Speaker 1: the way it plays out is that T&E Could have big gambles and big risks and big swings late game Mm-hmm.

237
00:17:03,003 --> 00:17:05,816
Speaker 1: Yellow and Yangtze has no big swings.

238
00:17:05,936 --> 00:17:09,911
Speaker 1: It is a Methodical march toward the game's conclusion, right?

239
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:12,038
Speaker 0: Oh the other thing is that in yellow and yangtze.

240
00:17:12,058 --> 00:17:16,275
Speaker 0: There's a lot more Political things you can do but they're limited.

241
00:17:16,295 --> 00:17:19,376
Speaker 0: in the right We don't score big points or is.

242
00:17:19,396 --> 00:17:24,780
Speaker 0: in T&E You can't really do too much political stuff really because you have to sacrifice a lot.

243
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,926
Speaker 1: I'm not not as directly.

244
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:30,900
Speaker 0: yeah, and if you succeed in T&E you get a basically a fistful of cubes.

245
00:17:31,181 --> 00:17:34,134
Speaker 0: There's really not a lot of ways to get a fistful of cubes and why and why.

246
00:17:34,315 --> 00:17:39,170
Speaker 0: but what's very fascinating Is that yellow and yangtze and it's very hard to hold anything in Y&Y.

247
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:47,879
Speaker 1: the the specific changes that are pretty subtle are Almost a catalogue of the minor complaints we had about T&E.

248
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,819
Speaker 1: Like there's a really fiddly rule that many players are feeling this has been removed.

249
00:17:52,859 --> 00:17:53,847
Speaker 1: Yep There's no fiddliness.

250
00:17:54,330 --> 00:18:08,673
Speaker 1: many people who play T&E even if they play a lot never encounter the situation these two situations the situation where you want to place a leader that would happen to connect two kingdoms and The situation where you want to place a tile that would connect more than two kingdoms.

251
00:18:09,615 --> 00:18:22,458
Speaker 1: and Y&Y has specific Surgical solutions to those fiddly bits that are really really good Like they add to the game and one of them you might even be able to backport into T&E.

252
00:18:23,021 --> 00:18:24,126
Speaker 0: Maybe I wouldn't.

253
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,029
Speaker 0: I wouldn't do so though.

254
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:32,360
Speaker 1: I might attempt it once to see if it changes the game Just the one where you can play a tile and it won't trigger a cop.

255
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,864
Speaker 0: Anyway, it gives you one lousy point.

256
00:18:34,885 --> 00:18:41,459
Speaker 1: Yeah, the other big thing is that in T&E if your leaders got knocked off the board You gonna save anything for the episode about Y&Y?

257
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:49,473
Speaker 1: I think we'll have a lot to say once we play the game more but the other like sort of surgical change was that in T&E if your leaders get knocked off the board, you're kind of done.

258
00:18:49,714 --> 00:18:54,299
Speaker 0: Like it's real hard to get back on Late game it's hard to get back on Unless you have a fistful of red tiles.

259
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,252
Speaker 1: In general knocking people off the board is very powerful in T&E.

260
00:18:58,453 --> 00:19:01,772
Speaker 1: in Y&Y when leaders are off the board They have a minor power.

261
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:06,632
Speaker 1: So You almost have a little bit of a boost to get back on the board.

262
00:19:06,652 --> 00:19:06,913
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

263
00:19:07,334 --> 00:19:19,426
Speaker 0: That is a really get some points Yeah Anyway, so the major big news from Gen Con from Fantasy Flight Games who gave up on Netrunner and is usually Doesn't make good games.

264
00:19:19,928 --> 00:19:21,656
Speaker 0: You're right Fantasy Flight is this weird company.

265
00:19:21,676 --> 00:19:30,020
Speaker 0: They got bought by Asmodee, right and the CEO of Fantasy Flight is resigning which is good because I basically that's like the toy.

266
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,499
Speaker 0: He's basically the Twilight Imperium guy.

267
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,646
Speaker 0: Tells you a lot about what Fantasy Flight does.

268
00:19:35,047 --> 00:19:35,388
Speaker 0: but it's like.

269
00:19:35,448 --> 00:19:42,548
Speaker 0: all the games that Fantasy Flight themselves have made have turned out bad And it's like as publishers.

270
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,715
Speaker 0: they as my in my opinion.

271
00:19:44,735 --> 00:19:45,678
Speaker 0: They haven't really done great.

272
00:19:46,701 --> 00:19:57,314
Speaker 0: It's just that there are certain games that they publish that weren't made by them and those games are often good because People go to them to get things published because they're a somewhat big board game publisher.

273
00:19:57,334 --> 00:19:58,077
Speaker 0: Yep, right?

274
00:19:58,097 --> 00:20:07,101
Speaker 0: They've got the pipeline They've got the supply chain as like they often screw things up, but you know on the publishing side But it's still you can't root, you know It's still.

275
00:20:07,121 --> 00:20:09,050
Speaker 0: the game made by someone else is still good right.

276
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,400
Speaker 0: the fact that they publish teeny doesn't make teeny a bad game.

277
00:20:11,722 --> 00:20:12,727
Speaker 0: They publish citadels.

278
00:20:13,008 --> 00:20:13,209
Speaker 0: Yeah.

279
00:20:13,632 --> 00:20:14,939
Speaker 0: Anyway, Citadel is a great game.

280
00:20:15,522 --> 00:20:18,239
Speaker 1: So they gotta know we've broken it and we never need to play it again.

281
00:20:18,521 --> 00:20:23,900
Speaker 0: So Fantasy Flight, you know usually has things printed in China and brought over on the boat, right?

282
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:24,502
Speaker 0: Usually.

283
00:20:24,884 --> 00:20:46,350
Speaker 0: but they've developed over recent times this print-on-demand Facility I guess near where they are in Minnesota or whatever and they used I remember when they developed it because they started printing like prize Cards for netrunner with that and you could tell those cards were different in lower quality Yeah, but now it seems like they're printing like top quality cards there that you can't tell that They're not the the real deal, but more importantly

284
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:51,554
Speaker 1: they've clearly come up with a clever Printing process to do something specific, right?

285
00:20:51,574 --> 00:20:52,940
Speaker 1: So no one's really done, right?

286
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,516
Speaker 0: So Richard Garfield the creator of magic among other games has had this game idea where you would.

287
00:20:58,696 --> 00:21:11,498
Speaker 0: instead of making decks right for your customizable card game or collectible card game you would buy a deck and You'd open it up and inside would be a deck that's ready to play and you can't customize it.

288
00:21:11,678 --> 00:21:17,343
Speaker 0: and but Everyone who buys a deck has a completely different deck or at least somewhat different Right.

289
00:21:17,363 --> 00:21:20,860
Speaker 0: So me and Rand go to the store and we buy two decks and they're not the same.

290
00:21:20,961 --> 00:21:23,300
Speaker 0: We go to a different store and buy another deck and it's not the same.

291
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,270
Speaker 1: So it's not like me where there's 12 decks or whatever.

292
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:29,180
Speaker 1: I buy them and but there's billions of possible decks.

293
00:21:29,702 --> 00:21:35,480
Speaker 0: I think they said there's like six factions or something or some number of factions and each deck is gonna have three of them.

294
00:21:35,841 --> 00:21:39,580
Speaker 0: But you're not gonna just cuz you have a faction doesn't mean you have the same cards from that faction.

295
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,566
Speaker 0: It's like a few hundred cards in the game.

296
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:51,044
Speaker 0: So you're only gonna get like 60 of those cards in some random Combination right and it's like well some decks might be stronger than others some might be weaker But this is like.

297
00:21:51,064 --> 00:21:53,860
Speaker 0: this is a new thing in tabletop gaming.

298
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,707
Speaker 0: This is not something that's been done before.

299
00:21:56,128 --> 00:21:57,574
Speaker 0: that just for that alone.

300
00:21:57,634 --> 00:21:58,337
Speaker 0: good or bad.

301
00:21:58,357 --> 00:21:59,260
Speaker 0: That's exciting.

302
00:21:59,561 --> 00:22:00,946
Speaker 0: Yes, a new kind of game.

303
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,853
Speaker 1: We have to pay attention to it, right?

304
00:22:02,873 --> 00:22:07,319
Speaker 0: So they're publishing this game And it seemed it called key forge.

305
00:22:07,521 --> 00:22:12,840
Speaker 1: Oh here with a vast array of creatures artifacts abilities and over 104 quadrillion possible decks, right?

306
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,476
Speaker 0: So I watched a short demo video of the game and it seems like not the worst card game ever.

307
00:22:17,496 --> 00:22:21,150
Speaker 0: from the little I was Able to see and I read some articles.

308
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:27,014
Speaker 0: I read a thing Richard posted on Facebook talking about how he designed it a little bit.

309
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,020
Speaker 0: That was pretty fascinating.

310
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,740
Speaker 1: Oh, I saw that but I didn't read it yet.

311
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,970
Speaker 0: So I feel like I'm gonna buy one or two decks.

312
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:35,003
Speaker 0: and this is like hey you want to play a two-player game Right.

313
00:22:35,084 --> 00:22:40,340
Speaker 0: It's like well you bust out two decks You can sort of master them if you want to be competitive or something, right?

314
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:41,479
Speaker 0: But you can you know?

315
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:54,733
Speaker 0: Maybe eventually all your friends will just have their one deck and then when you meet someone at a convention if they have one It's like hey Right a lot better than you know, even netrunner at least socially maybe not as a game Yeah, but socially right it has.

316
00:22:54,753 --> 00:22:55,457
Speaker 0: it has a purpose.

317
00:22:55,538 --> 00:23:00,939
Speaker 0: if you know If everyone has a deck it's like two people waiting for the big board game to finish so that they can join in.

318
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:05,176
Speaker 0: Play a key for it right better than playing a hive a little gonna take you a little longer.

319
00:23:05,296 --> 00:23:07,000
Speaker 0: be a little better of a game maybe.

320
00:23:07,681 --> 00:23:11,260
Speaker 1: Anyway, see is I got a town which is a pretty good two-player like.

321
00:23:11,782 --> 00:23:12,665
Speaker 0: It sounds good.

322
00:23:12,745 --> 00:23:13,087
Speaker 0: Yeah.

323
00:23:13,127 --> 00:23:15,877
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even though I think we're done with a town.

324
00:23:15,897 --> 00:23:21,160
Speaker 1: I think we've solved it I find anyway, well, we've talked about any time another time.

325
00:23:21,806 --> 00:23:23,080
Speaker 0: So that's key Forge.

326
00:23:23,662 --> 00:23:34,400
Speaker 0: What FFG is done is since I guess Richard Garfield gave him this great idea and they were able to make this technology To print these decks at the printing press they decided hey, let's use this to make other games.

327
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,834
Speaker 0: So they had Cory who is the guy who made games.

328
00:23:38,034 --> 00:23:39,420
Speaker 0: He just he's a Fantasy Flight employee.

329
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,092
Speaker 0: He's made games like the Battlestar game, which I don't like.

330
00:23:42,132 --> 00:23:43,780
Speaker 0: I basically don't like anything Cory's ever made.

331
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:46,733
Speaker 0: I don't know if nothing is a bad person just saying bad for us.

332
00:23:46,853 --> 00:23:48,279
Speaker 0: I don't like any game Cory's ever made.

333
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:53,516
Speaker 0: so They had him make a game called.

334
00:23:53,536 --> 00:23:54,039
Speaker 0: What's it called?

335
00:23:54,941 --> 00:23:58,144
Speaker 0: discover So what this game is.

336
00:23:58,184 --> 00:24:07,185
Speaker 0: it's a co-op game where you're basically trying to overcome obstacles to go on an adventure or something like that and It's also sort of.

337
00:24:07,265 --> 00:24:11,900
Speaker 0: it sounds like it's sort of a storytelling game sort of like Arabian Nights the choose your own adventure one.

338
00:24:12,645 --> 00:24:14,014
Speaker 0: But you buy this game.

339
00:24:14,054 --> 00:24:14,839
Speaker 0: it comes in a box.

340
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,120
Speaker 0: Every box is different.

341
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,769
Speaker 0: You're gonna get different ponds different tiles different.

342
00:24:19,829 --> 00:24:19,969
Speaker 0: right.

343
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:23,824
Speaker 0: one box could have an adventure in the jungle and another box could have an adventure In the mountains.

344
00:24:24,367 --> 00:24:24,508
Speaker 0: right.

345
00:24:24,528 --> 00:24:26,440
Speaker 0: another box could have an under-the-sea adventure.

346
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,348
Speaker 0: You don't fucking know right and that gives you.

347
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:38,479
Speaker 0: so if you like this kind of game, which I probably won't but maybe you will It's like wow, they're gonna get people to buy like more than one copy of this game.

348
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:39,242
Speaker 0: Right.

349
00:24:39,362 --> 00:24:45,870
Speaker 0: usually when you got a board game like this you buy a copy and ever and one person owns a pandemic and everyone Keeps playing it.

350
00:24:46,296 --> 00:24:48,453
Speaker 0: now You could buy multiple copies.

351
00:24:48,493 --> 00:24:53,296
Speaker 0: if you're a super nerd Every time you're bored of the one you got you can go buy another one right.

352
00:24:53,778 --> 00:24:56,287
Speaker 0: also You could get all your friends to buy one.

353
00:24:56,307 --> 00:24:59,860
Speaker 0: Yeah instead of just one friend buying one right.

354
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:08,474
Speaker 0: so Being a good like Swap and trade community the point is oh, that's a good idea.

355
00:25:08,494 --> 00:25:10,260
Speaker 0: Yeah one trade it with someone else's.

356
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:10,943
Speaker 0: That's a real good.

357
00:25:11,003 --> 00:25:12,328
Speaker 0: I didn't even think of that.

358
00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:15,040
Speaker 1: You just bring it to every packs and swap with someone.

359
00:25:15,221 --> 00:25:23,391
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you play it swap it with someone else who's got a copy just and then it's like alright Why wouldn't you as long as not missing any pieces ruined or anything?

360
00:25:23,511 --> 00:25:24,414
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like man.

361
00:25:24,434 --> 00:25:32,980
Speaker 0: That's good, but yeah, this is really Ingenious to you know they got to use this technology on a different kind of game genre.

362
00:25:33,522 --> 00:25:36,853
Speaker 0: What other game genres will they use it on if it proves to be successful?

363
00:25:36,873 --> 00:25:42,943
Speaker 0: Oh, man, yeah I I mean I would just like to see the simplest Like.

364
00:25:42,963 --> 00:25:47,080
Speaker 0: they're already going in the deep end with this with like the unique decks and the unique games.

365
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:52,860
Speaker 1: I would look for a game like imagine Shogun or like a basic war type game, but just the map and the.

366
00:25:53,841 --> 00:25:55,165
Speaker 0: That's my idea.

367
00:25:55,406 --> 00:25:57,031
Speaker 0: You're just you're just passing off my ideas.

368
00:25:57,232 --> 00:25:58,416
Speaker 0: I had the same idea.

369
00:25:58,436 --> 00:25:59,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, just keep it simple.

370
00:25:59,741 --> 00:26:01,619
Speaker 0: Just have a war a basic war game.

371
00:26:02,121 --> 00:26:10,740
Speaker 0: Right a good war game solid game and just only thing that's unique is the map so that every time you know Maybe give you five maps in the box and every box is five unique maps.

372
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:13,554
Speaker 0: And it's like you trade maps with people that you know.

373
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:14,620
Speaker 0: the trading reserves idea.

374
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:21,106
Speaker 1: I feel like you have one more unique aspect than just the mat because we already have Expansions to a million million games.

375
00:26:21,126 --> 00:26:22,389
Speaker 0: that here's a different board.

376
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:23,232
Speaker 1: Here's a different map.

377
00:26:23,673 --> 00:26:25,920
Speaker 1: I have like four formula day expansions up there.

378
00:26:26,341 --> 00:26:29,594
Speaker 0: Yeah, imagine a formula day just like random racetracks.

379
00:26:30,116 --> 00:26:31,080
Speaker 1: actually that could be pretty fun.

380
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:36,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, or like you know you everyone gets different D&D characters in their RPG box.

381
00:26:36,885 --> 00:26:39,080
Speaker 1: Oh the RPG world would be interesting.

382
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:45,540
Speaker 0: I'm just saying yeah the procedural generation at the printing press is gonna make some good stuff in the tabletop world.

383
00:26:46,402 --> 00:26:47,967
Speaker 0: This is the thing to pay attention to.

384
00:26:48,027 --> 00:26:50,635
Speaker 0: this is the height of current tabletop tech.

385
00:26:51,056 --> 00:26:52,300
Speaker 0: that must not be overlooked.

386
00:26:52,461 --> 00:26:58,651
Speaker 1: So when someone finds the god deck of Key Forge Will that just be like this priceless artifact?

387
00:26:58,811 --> 00:26:59,413
Speaker 0: well no so.

388
00:26:59,473 --> 00:27:06,696
Speaker 1: apparently if you write the bidding chains If you read a Richard Garfield's article for serious people will have a way to balance a handicap.

389
00:27:06,757 --> 00:27:13,260
Speaker 0: right serious players There's gonna be some sort of like mechanic called bidding chains where you I guess you bid a number of chains.

390
00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:15,413
Speaker 0: I guess it's and the details aren't.

391
00:27:15,494 --> 00:27:23,345
Speaker 0: he doesn't say the details But in my guess is that it's like when you sit down to play you would bid like I'm gonna beat you by three And that you know.

392
00:27:23,386 --> 00:27:31,280
Speaker 0: it's like if your deck is strong you have an incentive to bid higher Right that and then to sort of balance things out when you know your deck is strong.

393
00:27:31,863 --> 00:27:34,013
Speaker 0: So this book is going over to it.

394
00:27:34,033 --> 00:27:35,340
Speaker 1: than that though because I'd always bid low.

395
00:27:35,702 --> 00:27:35,963
Speaker 1: I don't.

396
00:27:36,164 --> 00:27:37,310
Speaker 0: I'm sure this is gonna be some.

397
00:27:37,471 --> 00:27:39,200
Speaker 0: it's gonna work in some reasonable way.

398
00:27:39,361 --> 00:27:41,152
Speaker 1: I suspect what'll happen is serious.

399
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:49,044
Speaker 1: people will do this mechanic Which I don't know how it works yet, and everyone else will ignore it and just have OP decks or no or non OP decks Yeah, or what?

400
00:27:49,064 --> 00:27:53,465
Speaker 0: if you just meet someone who plays casually, but they happen to have this OP deck Then you buy it from them.

401
00:27:53,565 --> 00:27:55,773
Speaker 1: I wonder I think real OP decks.

402
00:27:56,034 --> 00:27:57,399
Speaker 1: There will be a secondary market?

403
00:27:57,419 --> 00:27:57,882
Speaker 0: well Not it.

404
00:27:58,004 --> 00:28:03,851
Speaker 0: well if there's any competitive scene though You're gonna have to do the bidding thing and if that balances it out Then it doesn't matter what deck you have though.

405
00:28:03,972 --> 00:28:08,754
Speaker 0: what it'll be really interesting Deck will be the one you have and have learned and mastered the most.

406
00:28:08,914 --> 00:28:22,206
Speaker 1: what will be very interesting to me Is that if done properly most people even people who play a lot of tabletop games are fucking awful at bidding like bidding is Such a rare skill.

407
00:28:22,226 --> 00:28:27,520
Speaker 0: people who play competitive card games seriously and go to tournaments are excellent at bidding.

408
00:28:27,742 --> 00:28:29,133
Speaker 1: I don't know if you're excellent at bidding.

409
00:28:29,153 --> 00:28:29,899
Speaker 1: They're excellent at all.

410
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,050
Speaker 0: the Play netrunner against top tier game.

411
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,676
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, but what about magic?

412
00:28:36,138 --> 00:28:36,620
Speaker 1: how many man?

413
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,670
Speaker 1: How many top tier magic players are good at bidding?

414
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:40,700
Speaker 0: the top tier ones are gonna bid your head good?

415
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,240
Speaker 1: They're real good, but they don't have to be good at bidding to be good at magic.

416
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,830
Speaker 0: People who win magic grand prix's are excellent gamers.

417
00:28:47,051 --> 00:28:48,336
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but even fuck out.

418
00:28:48,396 --> 00:28:50,183
Speaker 0: even excellent gamers They're better than you.

419
00:28:50,484 --> 00:28:51,347
Speaker 1: even excellent gamers.

420
00:28:51,407 --> 00:28:55,760
Speaker 1: I find are Awful at bidding and valuation anyway.

421
00:28:57,003 --> 00:28:59,000
Speaker 0: But yeah, so it'll be interesting.

422
00:29:00,381 --> 00:29:02,351
Speaker 0: That's what gave us the idea to do a show in handicap.

423
00:29:02,371 --> 00:29:04,099
Speaker 0: such we hadn't done which I thought we did.

424
00:29:08,842 --> 00:29:14,076
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day, so this is just a tweet, but it's pretty good.

425
00:29:14,176 --> 00:29:14,457
Speaker 1: It's just.

426
00:29:14,758 --> 00:29:20,400
Speaker 1: I love the justice But it's the photograph of the top of a urinal somewhere.

427
00:29:20,661 --> 00:29:23,135
Speaker 0: And does it have a sticker from a computer like yours does?

428
00:29:23,899 --> 00:29:25,988
Speaker 1: no It does not have my my your.

429
00:29:26,028 --> 00:29:31,550
Speaker 1: my toilet has g-skill ram in it, okay And also my marker wave has nice.

430
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,092
Speaker 1: We should get.

431
00:29:32,112 --> 00:29:37,274
Speaker 0: we should get like one megabyte g-skill ram That's worth nothing and just stick it in the top just over decker deck it.

432
00:29:38,118 --> 00:29:38,500
Speaker 1: I showed.

433
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:47,782
Speaker 1: Anyway the serial number on this urinal is Legendary.

434
00:29:47,923 --> 00:29:56,830
Speaker 1: if this is photoshopped, I don't even care, but I want to believe that it's not because the serial number is For you to PN2.

435
00:29:56,951 --> 00:29:57,272
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

436
00:29:58,397 --> 00:29:58,960
Speaker 1: It's perfect.

437
00:29:59,322 --> 00:30:01,757
Speaker 1: This is exactly what I needed in my life.

438
00:30:01,797 --> 00:30:05,211
Speaker 0: right now It also might not even it might even if it's not photoshopped.

439
00:30:05,231 --> 00:30:13,709
Speaker 1: someone could have made that sticker and put it on a toilet Which is a plus because that is on the level of the kind of prank One of my favorite pranks in the world.

440
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,540
Speaker 1: with this dude not a good night for flying.

441
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,406
Speaker 1: This is much more subtle.

442
00:30:16,728 --> 00:30:31,346
Speaker 1: this dude busted into a mall at night and there was an Italian restaurant and they had this like metal fake wrought-iron thing that had like grapes and like Tomatoes like kind of carved on it Bit bit by bit over the course of months.

443
00:30:31,808 --> 00:30:46,013
Speaker 1: He cut the fruit the vegetables off and replaced them with bananas That he had sculpted until eventually this Italian restaurant had this like wrought-iron grade that had nothing but bananas on it And no one ever noticed.

444
00:30:46,316 --> 00:30:46,800
Speaker 0: No, I would.

445
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,709
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a good prank.

446
00:30:49,749 --> 00:30:52,139
Speaker 1: that's the kind of thing I like anyway, so what do you got?

447
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:56,212
Speaker 0: So there's this Twitter account and the Twitter account.

448
00:30:56,292 --> 00:30:58,961
Speaker 0: It's one of those Twitter accounts where it's like, you know It's not.

449
00:30:59,042 --> 00:31:00,427
Speaker 0: it's not a real person, right?

450
00:31:00,487 --> 00:31:04,300
Speaker 0: It's just sort of photos of you know, it's a sort of character, right?

451
00:31:04,942 --> 00:31:06,989
Speaker 0: So there's a Pokemon called electrode.

452
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:08,916
Speaker 0: an electrode is basically it looks like a pokeball.

453
00:31:08,936 --> 00:31:14,880
Speaker 0: it's red and white ball Yeah, and it's kind of angry and if you get near it explodes and it's got like the snarky face, right?

454
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:21,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there's another Pokemon called ditto and ditto is like this blob and it becomes any other Pokemon.

455
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:32,558
Speaker 0: The thing is if ditto becomes a Pokemon it looks exactly like the Pokemon is copying except except it's got the different face Right, which is pretty much two dots and a smiley.

456
00:31:33,449 --> 00:31:36,750
Speaker 0: So apparently Because Pokemon is just so enormous.

457
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:42,143
Speaker 0: They've made plushies in the past Because there's a whole line of Pokemon plushies That

458
00:31:42,283 --> 00:31:42,745
Speaker 1: are not

459
00:31:42,825 --> 00:32:00,580
Speaker 0: electrode and not did I'm sure they've made both electrode and ditto, but they've also made plushies that are ditto as Can get an electrode ditto plushie, which is an electrode plushie with a stupid face on it Or a poly with a bit even better a poly world plushie with a silly face on.

460
00:32:02,407 --> 00:32:19,380
Speaker 0: And so somebody took one of these ditto electrode plushies Which is ridiculously cute and they made a Twitter account where they would put the ditto electrode in places and photo it in various cute scenarios on an almost daily basis and they just open an Instagram account also.

461
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:20,205
Speaker 0: so you got your pick.

462
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:27,272
Speaker 0: so it's ditto as electrode and Even better friend ditto as poly world and some other ditto friends.

463
00:32:27,432 --> 00:32:28,054
Speaker 1: It's good stuff.

464
00:32:28,194 --> 00:32:31,493
Speaker 0: It's like the cutest Twitter account That's going right now.

465
00:32:31,594 --> 00:32:33,725
Speaker 0: It's like Pusheen level of cuteness.

466
00:32:33,886 --> 00:32:35,431
Speaker 1: It is definitely Pusheen adjacent.

467
00:32:35,571 --> 00:32:38,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think there's even like a magnetite.

468
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,818
Speaker 0: That's Pusheen and I'm not sure it's a magnetite.

469
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,440
Speaker 1: Anyway ditto as Pusheen there.

470
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:58,198
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you want to look at cute pictures of a plushie like, you know at amusement park on the beach in the mall Happy Wednesday having a cake going to sleep playing with a dog This is the Twitter account for you.

471
00:32:58,963 --> 00:33:05,555
Speaker 1: So in the meta moment the geek nights book club book is no longer Homer's Odyssey But it is now the Space Odyssey the 2001 Space Odyssey.

472
00:33:08,304 --> 00:33:09,373
Speaker 1: So yeah, we have a book club.

473
00:33:09,393 --> 00:33:09,958
Speaker 1: You should do it.

474
00:33:10,842 --> 00:33:16,860
Speaker 1: We are doing a panel at PAX West on Monday morning, which Monday badges almost sold out.

475
00:33:17,343 --> 00:33:19,138
Speaker 1: There's only 16 days before PAX.

476
00:33:20,586 --> 00:33:23,542
Speaker 1: God, it's really coming up Good times.

477
00:33:23,823 --> 00:33:25,308
Speaker 1: so on Monday at 10 a.m.

478
00:33:25,368 --> 00:33:26,151
Speaker 1: Pacific time.

479
00:33:26,452 --> 00:33:28,117
Speaker 1: We were doing the 40 tabletop games.

480
00:33:28,157 --> 00:33:34,788
Speaker 1: You must play Otherwise, we'll just be there playing games cuz it's packs And that's what we got.

481
00:33:34,808 --> 00:33:35,292
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

482
00:33:35,715 --> 00:33:38,674
Speaker 1: So Handicapping, I don't think we've never done this specifically.

483
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:45,600
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess we haven't done a main bit that was called handicapping But I feel like we've talked about it many many times in the show in the past.

484
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,079
Speaker 1: Well, it's interesting is very a lot of gay especially tabletop games.

485
00:33:49,702 --> 00:33:51,589
Speaker 1: Rarely if ever have this concept.

486
00:33:51,730 --> 00:34:00,440
Speaker 0: no, but so handicapping in games is Mostly you see it in games like bowling and golf and these are games that are individual sports.

487
00:34:01,025 --> 00:34:01,389
Speaker 0: But you're like.

488
00:34:01,409 --> 00:34:02,560
Speaker 0: tennis is an individual sport.

489
00:34:02,647 --> 00:34:07,899
Speaker 0: Yeah But in tennis you're directly competing against another human being like in the actual tennis match, right?

490
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:11,094
Speaker 0: You beat them and that's your measure of who's better me or you?

491
00:34:11,396 --> 00:34:20,034
Speaker 0: when you play golf Yeah, you can you play the same course as someone else at the same time, but there's no like direct Competition between you both playing.

492
00:34:20,094 --> 00:34:20,679
Speaker 0: are you bowl?

493
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:25,780
Speaker 0: It's like I bowl and you're bowling in the same lane as me at the same time, but there's no direct battle.

494
00:34:26,242 --> 00:34:31,440
Speaker 0: So the real measure in these sports is not whether you beat someone else at that exact moment.

495
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:39,100
Speaker 0: Right because nothing you do influences their game except psychologically, right when they see your score up there on the board or whatever, right?

496
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,150
Speaker 0: It's that you are trying to improve yourself.

497
00:34:41,472 --> 00:34:44,646
Speaker 0: You're competing against yourself and You know you.

498
00:34:44,687 --> 00:34:48,202
Speaker 0: so it's like well if I did better than I did before then I've Succeeded.

499
00:34:48,222 --> 00:34:52,520
Speaker 0: and therefore when you want to compare people at these sports you would use a handicap.

500
00:34:52,721 --> 00:34:55,149
Speaker 0: So it's like well, look, I'm an old man, right?

501
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:58,080
Speaker 0: Obviously, I'm not gonna get a 60 at the golf course.

502
00:34:58,401 --> 00:35:09,200
Speaker 1: But handicapping is also used in direct competition games to allow two people with vastly different skill To play a competitive feeling meaningful game against each other, right?

503
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:13,496
Speaker 0: Well game, you know a game like power grid would have a catch-up mechanisms built in.

504
00:35:13,556 --> 00:35:14,761
Speaker 0: it's not handicapping It's.

505
00:35:15,142 --> 00:35:21,440
Speaker 0: the game is designed in such a way to give the player who's behind more power.

506
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:28,060
Speaker 1: Handicapping would be the player who is better at power grid starts with less money, right?

507
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:28,983
Speaker 0: Hey anything like that.

508
00:35:29,003 --> 00:35:38,491
Speaker 0: handicapping is like an external almost artificial interfering or Unbalancing of the game intentionally, right?

509
00:35:38,571 --> 00:35:40,620
Speaker 0: It's like you starting Monopoly with less money.

510
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:44,656
Speaker 0: It's like they can't be a rule of the game that like you arbitrarily start with less money.

511
00:35:44,696 --> 00:35:45,660
Speaker 0: It's not fair, right?

512
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,427
Speaker 0: But it's like that's what.

513
00:35:47,467 --> 00:35:48,892
Speaker 0: what do you think handicap in golf?

514
00:35:48,952 --> 00:35:50,920
Speaker 0: I'll give you 20 strokes, right?

515
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:54,957
Speaker 0: It's like you just start with a score of negative 20 and I start with a score of zero.

516
00:35:54,997 --> 00:35:55,660
Speaker 0: It's not fair.

517
00:35:55,700 --> 00:36:01,760
Speaker 0: It's you you insert some artificial unfairness and misalignment at the start of the game.

518
00:36:02,281 --> 00:36:09,161
Speaker 0: So that way you you can basically say, ah, you know, yeah, obviously I beat you but I didn't beat you by 20.

519
00:36:09,161 --> 00:36:13,176
Speaker 0: Yeah means I was playing worse than I'm supposed to and you're playing better than you're supposed to.

520
00:36:13,517 --> 00:36:15,285
Speaker 0: so we say that you beat Me, right?

521
00:36:15,366 --> 00:36:21,960
Speaker 1: So for example, I'm really good at ping-pong But my dad is unfucking beatable at ping-pong and he taught me how to play.

522
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,200
Speaker 0: I'm sure there are people who will just destroy your dad ping-pong.

523
00:36:25,421 --> 00:36:32,105
Speaker 1: I'm seeing them on YouTube, but I've done well back when I was in the like New York Finance tournament scene Which I am NOT anymore.

524
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:35,280
Speaker 1: I actually haven't played ping-pong in like seven years.

525
00:36:36,022 --> 00:36:43,161
Speaker 1: But my dad when he was teaching me the way he would do it is I would win if I got even one point against him Mm-hmm.

526
00:36:43,463 --> 00:36:47,902
Speaker 1: And once I started beating him now, I'd win if I got two points against him Mm-hmm.

527
00:36:47,942 --> 00:36:52,800
Speaker 1: I never got better than a handicap of you need five points against my dad.

528
00:36:54,102 --> 00:36:54,664
Speaker 0: He's real good.

529
00:36:54,765 --> 00:36:56,271
Speaker 0: He'd been playing it for a long time.

530
00:36:56,291 --> 00:36:59,710
Speaker 1: Yeah in firemen just hanging out Like what are you gonna do when there isn't a fire?

531
00:37:00,012 --> 00:37:01,099
Speaker 1: Yep gonna play ping-pong?

532
00:37:02,062 --> 00:37:03,046
Speaker 0: They didn't have video games.

533
00:37:03,327 --> 00:37:20,076
Speaker 1: Yep, but the tricky part about handicapping is that unless it's done Methodically and unless the data you have about the players to determine the handicap is some objective useful measure Handicapping is really hard to do.

534
00:37:21,002 --> 00:37:25,920
Speaker 1: Like you're not gonna be able to make a fair handicap in a game without a lot of data and a lot of rigor.

535
00:37:26,122 --> 00:37:30,755
Speaker 0: Handicapping Precisely is extremely extremely difficult, right?

536
00:37:30,836 --> 00:37:35,940
Speaker 0: Usually in bowling It's like you just know your own handicap that you keep track of over time, right?

537
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:41,318
Speaker 0: and it's and usually it's only It's up to you and sort of the honor system to show up at the bowling alley and enter it in.

538
00:37:41,338 --> 00:37:44,450
Speaker 0: if you're in a League the league will track it for you over time.

539
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:47,300
Speaker 1: or it's used in situations where there is a formal ladder.

540
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:52,639
Speaker 1: There's a formal ranking system of some kind and handicaps are determined based on that system.

541
00:37:53,663 --> 00:37:56,972
Speaker 0: But even when there are handicaps like well the best person still wins.

542
00:37:57,454 --> 00:38:01,814
Speaker 1: so I learned something interesting just now Where the turn handicap comes from?

543
00:38:01,834 --> 00:38:06,030
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, you know Because I didn't and now I do.

544
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,920
Speaker 0: I mean I can sort of guess the etymology.

545
00:38:08,482 --> 00:38:10,409
Speaker 1: So you're probably really wrong.

546
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:20,460
Speaker 1: the term handicap derives from hand in cap Uh-huh referring to a system wherein players place bets or money into the cap of a neutral arbiter to reach an agreement.

547
00:38:21,042 --> 00:38:23,431
Speaker 1: What for the relative value of items being traded?

548
00:38:23,872 --> 00:38:24,615
Speaker 1: I feel like we could.

549
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,386
Speaker 1: I Just read this Wikipedia article.

550
00:38:27,446 --> 00:38:30,760
Speaker 1: We could definitely make a simple tabletop game that uses this mechanic.

551
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:33,649
Speaker 1: I've never seen this mechanic used anywhere.

552
00:38:33,669 --> 00:38:34,211
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

553
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:35,695
Speaker 1: So it's an old English.

554
00:38:35,796 --> 00:38:36,398
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna read it.

555
00:38:36,438 --> 00:38:37,140
Speaker 1: It's one paragraph.

556
00:38:37,562 --> 00:38:38,447
Speaker 1: This is kind of fascinating.

557
00:38:38,568 --> 00:38:40,378
Speaker 1: Okay an old English trading game.

558
00:38:41,661 --> 00:38:43,847
Speaker 1: Two players want to trade possessions.

559
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:46,955
Speaker 0: Like I want to trade you my car for your Nintendo switch.

560
00:38:47,015 --> 00:38:47,877
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

561
00:38:48,278 --> 00:38:52,571
Speaker 1: an umpire Decides whether the items have the same value.

562
00:38:52,591 --> 00:38:53,073
Speaker 0: they don't.

563
00:38:53,193 --> 00:38:58,210
Speaker 1: a car is worth way more and if not What the what that umpire believes the difference is?

564
00:38:58,350 --> 00:38:59,373
Speaker 0: Well, it's a $20,000 car and it's a $500 switch.

565
00:39:01,801 --> 00:39:04,414
Speaker 0: So we'll say 19. it's basically a three nineteen five hundred.

566
00:39:04,595 --> 00:39:05,620
Speaker 1: It's three-way gambling.

567
00:39:06,102 --> 00:39:12,996
Speaker 1: So the players the two players who want to trade and the umpire Agree to forfeit money into a cap.

568
00:39:14,145 --> 00:39:26,377
Speaker 1: Okay The players didn't put their hands into the cap and then they either leave their hand open or closed To signal whether or not they agree with the valuation or disagree with the valuation that the umpire decided.

569
00:39:26,398 --> 00:39:38,119
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm if both players agree the difference in valuation is paid and The items are traded and the umpire collects the forfeit and there's a little bit more to it.

570
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,499
Speaker 0: But basically one I don't get it.

571
00:39:40,781 --> 00:39:53,956
Speaker 1: So one person bets on what the difference in value is and the other end the two players have put up stakes that may or may not have different value and then you who like each of us would forfeit the amount of money.

572
00:39:54,036 --> 00:39:58,592
Speaker 1: that is the difference and Then we'd agree whether or not I forfeit nineteen five.

573
00:39:58,612 --> 00:40:00,057
Speaker 0: you forfeit nineteen five.

574
00:40:00,078 --> 00:40:01,705
Speaker 0: now We've got like twenty.

575
00:40:01,746 --> 00:40:03,374
Speaker 0: you got a zillion dollars in there.

576
00:40:03,394 --> 00:40:04,380
Speaker 0: Oh, okay, then what?

577
00:40:05,341 --> 00:40:05,562
Speaker 1: So the?

578
00:40:05,682 --> 00:40:14,202
Speaker 1: apparently this was played in the 14th century And That's it.

579
00:40:14,222 --> 00:40:15,588
Speaker 1: There's not that much more information here.

580
00:40:15,668 --> 00:40:16,331
Speaker 0: I still don't get it.

581
00:40:17,355 --> 00:40:18,540
Speaker 1: I feel like I can put this in a game.

582
00:40:18,862 --> 00:40:19,264
Speaker 0: I don't get it.

583
00:40:19,324 --> 00:40:21,595
Speaker 1: I feel like there is a way to make this a game mechanic.

584
00:40:21,616 --> 00:40:22,399
Speaker 0: You haven't explained it.

585
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,223
Speaker 0: I don't understand.

586
00:40:23,604 --> 00:40:25,673
Speaker 1: I think I need I'll find a diagram or something.

587
00:40:25,693 --> 00:40:26,115
Speaker 1: I'll link to.

588
00:40:26,617 --> 00:40:27,420
Speaker 0: okay anyway.

589
00:40:28,321 --> 00:40:34,139
Speaker 1: so Handicap says handicapping systems are actually pretty common in video games, especially fighting games.

590
00:40:34,561 --> 00:40:43,100
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, I don't haven't seen them in recent fighting games But back in the day when you played Street Fighter They would like these stars at least on my home version of Street Fighter 2 championship edition.

591
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:44,347
Speaker 0: Oh, and it's like you would.

592
00:40:44,407 --> 00:40:46,580
Speaker 0: we would always leave it at three because he felt like that was the default.

593
00:40:46,761 --> 00:40:49,860
Speaker 1: We left it at whatever the default was because we had no idea what it was, right?

594
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,080
Speaker 0: It wasn't explained very well.

595
00:40:51,120 --> 00:41:05,945
Speaker 0: But I guess if you increased or decrease the stars I don't know which you would get like more or less health or do more or less damage than normal and this way a very Good player could play against a weak player and still have like a close Battle, so it's funny.

596
00:41:05,985 --> 00:41:15,089
Speaker 1: You don't know which because I googled for this and I found on the Super Street Fighter 2 Message board on game facts ten years ago.

597
00:41:15,531 --> 00:41:18,458
Speaker 1: Someone asked do more stars make you stronger or weaker.

598
00:41:18,478 --> 00:41:20,090
Speaker 0: Yep What does it say?

599
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:23,627
Speaker 1: Uh Someone said more stars means more power.

600
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:26,736
Speaker 1: I think three stars is considered normal.

601
00:41:26,756 --> 00:41:28,762
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I remember Someone else.

602
00:41:28,823 --> 00:41:30,529
Speaker 1: I think four stars is normal.

603
00:41:30,549 --> 00:41:31,833
Speaker 0: Okay, someone else.

604
00:41:31,873 --> 00:41:33,639
Speaker 1: Yep, but more stars made you stronger.

605
00:41:34,382 --> 00:41:42,670
Speaker 0: So basically if you were the crap if you're a little kid and playing against someone who's actually good The good player would go one star Yeah, and the kid would get like ten stars.

606
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:44,540
Speaker 1: Smash Brothers has the mechanic where you can start.

607
00:41:44,701 --> 00:41:46,728
Speaker 1: You can make a player start with a higher percentage.

608
00:41:46,749 --> 00:41:47,552
Speaker 1: Yeah.

609
00:41:47,572 --> 00:41:49,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can also I think give people more stocks.

610
00:41:50,061 --> 00:41:51,345
Speaker 0: I think I'm not mistaken.

611
00:41:51,365 --> 00:41:54,816
Speaker 1: I think there's a bunch of handicapping mechanisms in Smash.

612
00:41:55,177 --> 00:41:56,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, no one ever uses them.

613
00:41:56,625 --> 00:41:59,646
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Definitely the tournament scene doesn't I?

614
00:42:00,228 --> 00:42:09,420
Speaker 1: I get the impression that video games and eSports Both professional and amateur have zero interest in handicapping.

615
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:18,840
Speaker 0: Well, no because if you're doing an actual tournament, right of say, you know Street Fighter it's like well everyone has to have the same freaking thing.

616
00:42:18,881 --> 00:42:20,040
Speaker 0: You can't be having more help.

617
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:29,560
Speaker 1: But I've seen in especially in amateur casual sports Even tournaments with cash prizes will in would incorporate handicapping in like golf and tennis and all sorts of sports.

618
00:42:29,741 --> 00:42:32,794
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, that's that's very common even when they're a different situation.

619
00:42:33,015 --> 00:42:34,080
Speaker 1: significant cash prizes.

620
00:42:34,521 --> 00:42:40,580
Speaker 1: But if there was a significant cash prize in an eSport, I feel like no one involved would be willing to entertain a handicap.

621
00:42:41,132 --> 00:42:42,843
Speaker 0: No Not at all.

622
00:42:43,666 --> 00:42:44,108
Speaker 1: I wonder just.

623
00:42:44,369 --> 00:42:46,860
Speaker 1: it seems like there's no difference other than a difference in culture.

624
00:42:47,121 --> 00:42:47,543
Speaker 0: Well, it's.

625
00:42:47,864 --> 00:42:49,290
Speaker 0: it's a cultural but it's not.

626
00:42:49,351 --> 00:42:51,058
Speaker 0: it's also not just the cash prize right?

627
00:42:51,138 --> 00:42:51,560
Speaker 0: think about this.

628
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:56,860
Speaker 0: Like let's say I'm running a geek night's golf tournament right to get money for the charity of geek?

629
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,839
Speaker 0: Yes, and people pay to get in and we give out some prizes from sponsors, right?

630
00:43:01,983 --> 00:43:05,932
Speaker 0: Being the champion of the geek night's Golf tournament doesn't mean anything.

631
00:43:05,953 --> 00:43:06,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

632
00:43:07,162 --> 00:43:10,800
Speaker 0: So if you're the United's Golf Tournament champion, that doesn't mean anything, right?

633
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:16,704
Speaker 0: But if you suck at golf and say let's say Tiger Woods is also coming to the tournament You want to have it?

634
00:43:16,945 --> 00:43:21,120
Speaker 0: Why would you pay to enter my golf tournament if you have no chance of winning a prize, right?

635
00:43:21,241 --> 00:43:22,165
Speaker 0: It's like you want.

636
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:27,520
Speaker 0: you want to basically feel like if you go out there and play your best round That you're gonna win something, right?

637
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:32,820
Speaker 0: It's like you don't want to show up and already see that there's a pro there who's there for the charity who's gonna win everything.

638
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,889
Speaker 0: So it's like you're there for the prizes.

639
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:41,272
Speaker 0: I'd say Evo if you're there to play Street Fighter You're there to see who the best Street Fighter in the world is.

640
00:43:41,292 --> 00:43:46,095
Speaker 0: they don't use handicaps in the PGA Tour Right to where they're trying to find the best golfers are right?

641
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:51,740
Speaker 0: They don't use handicaps of us open where they're trying to see the best tennis player is or the US Open of golf.

642
00:43:52,542 --> 00:44:01,311
Speaker 0: They only use handicaps at these tournaments and events where it's about the prizes or some other thing and not Being the champion doesn't have any meaning.

643
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:03,099
Speaker 1: but one thing I've noticed sort of it.

644
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:08,600
Speaker 0: It'd be okay to use handicaps in say your local softball league, right?

645
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,080
Speaker 0: But it would not be okay to use handicaps at the softball Olympics.

646
00:44:12,481 --> 00:44:14,047
Speaker 1: So this might be anecdotal.

647
00:44:14,147 --> 00:44:17,520
Speaker 0: some team some countries that have really really bad a softball could probably use it.

648
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:18,242
Speaker 1: Well, it might be.

649
00:44:18,282 --> 00:44:24,660
Speaker 1: no this is anecdotal but I get the impression forget tournaments even in casual video game play where?

650
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,507
Speaker 1: Handicapping mechanisms exist.

651
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:33,539
Speaker 1: I find that even when players have disparate skills There seems to be a still a strong resistance to using these features.

652
00:44:33,701 --> 00:44:35,885
Speaker 0: Uh-huh I think there shouldn't be those.

653
00:44:35,925 --> 00:44:38,273
Speaker 0: those are the situations that these features are perfect for.

654
00:44:38,293 --> 00:44:42,467
Speaker 0: I think part of it is because the features Aren't up front and don't describe themselves.

655
00:44:42,527 --> 00:44:43,551
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, right.

656
00:44:43,571 --> 00:44:46,119
Speaker 0: They don't present themselves in a way that you know.

657
00:44:47,944 --> 00:44:49,208
Speaker 1: The Street Fighter 2 one right.

658
00:44:49,248 --> 00:44:56,600
Speaker 0: the user interface is not presented in such a way that you know It makes people go and find it's usually like in a sub menu or something, right?

659
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:02,703
Speaker 0: What if instead right you were to say load up Smash Brothers and it'd be like, okay, you know Who's?

660
00:45:02,985 --> 00:45:04,960
Speaker 0: who is player one player one's a little three.

661
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,470
Speaker 0: You just you told the game.

662
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:13,500
Speaker 0: player one is a five-year-old Right player two is an e-sport champion and player three is just someone who's played a lot of video games.

663
00:45:13,982 --> 00:45:17,279
Speaker 0: Right if you could just tell the game that and it just adjusted accordingly.

664
00:45:19,021 --> 00:45:26,707
Speaker 1: Or if the game you registered a profile and over time the game itself calculated your handicap Right and or you would just.

665
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:34,598
Speaker 0: you know, even if you didn't have profiles you just start playing Right and as long as you don't switch controllers, you just keep playing and over time, right?

666
00:45:35,321 --> 00:45:36,671
Speaker 0: You don't even know it's handicapping.

667
00:45:36,691 --> 00:45:44,680
Speaker 0: you just say, you know Balance mode on because you're you know that the player is playing aren't playing seriously and have disparate skill levels, right?

668
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:45,419
Speaker 0: You just you agree.

669
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:55,819
Speaker 0: Okay It's on and then as you you might play the first match and the best player is gonna destroy you and then starting in match To match three as you go on suddenly having these close exciting matches now, right?

670
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:56,981
Speaker 0: so

671
00:45:57,021 --> 00:45:58,166
Speaker 1: overwatch and also

672
00:45:58,186 --> 00:46:11,380
Speaker 0: if as your skills would increase because you're you know Even though you would be able to stay alive longer see what that good player is doing learn from them And then the handicap for you would start to decrease to make up for your skill increase.

673
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:15,632
Speaker 1: So this isn't straight handicapping but overwatch does something very fascinating like that.

674
00:46:15,693 --> 00:46:18,180
Speaker 0: Remember initial D had the in the arcade.

675
00:46:18,202 --> 00:46:20,592
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah If you hell if you secret there's a secret feature.

676
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:24,640
Speaker 1: if you held down the brake When you started the mail the race it set everything up.

677
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,074
Speaker 0: No, I think you still held down the clutch when you turn the car on.

678
00:46:27,094 --> 00:46:28,200
Speaker 1: No you held down the brake.

679
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:28,983
Speaker 1: There was no clutch.

680
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:30,608
Speaker 0: I think there were anyway.

681
00:46:30,628 --> 00:46:31,572
Speaker 0: No, there's no clutch.

682
00:46:31,752 --> 00:46:32,555
Speaker 1: There's a shifter.

683
00:46:32,836 --> 00:46:34,820
Speaker 1: You didn't have to hit a clutch There was something.

684
00:46:35,422 --> 00:46:44,119
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is that yeah an initial D arcade game if you just play default without knowing it Basically gives a speed boost to whoever the car and back is.

685
00:46:44,661 --> 00:46:50,760
Speaker 0: So whoever's losing the race basically gets boosted so much that they will be on the ass of the person first.

686
00:46:50,901 --> 00:46:54,700
Speaker 0: It's only a two-car race, but rubber band mechanics are not handicapping.

687
00:46:55,021 --> 00:47:03,373
Speaker 1: No, they're adjacent and they serve a similar purpose in some ways, but they They readjust themselves over the course of a single game.

688
00:47:03,413 --> 00:47:05,060
Speaker 1: they're not based on your past history.

689
00:47:05,842 --> 00:47:08,939
Speaker 1: They just try to make the game 50/50 no matter what at all times.

690
00:47:09,141 --> 00:47:11,945
Speaker 0: Well, it's a little bit a little bit But they don't like.

691
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:17,680
Speaker 1: if I'm better than you and I'm ahead of you It keeps you close to me, but if you pass me it keeps me close to you.

692
00:47:17,862 --> 00:47:24,080
Speaker 0: But if I'm really good at power grid And I just managed to stay ahead the whole time you bouncing off the bottom probably isn't gonna be enough.

693
00:47:24,542 --> 00:47:25,185
Speaker 0: But you had.

694
00:47:25,306 --> 00:47:28,060
Speaker 0: if you intelligently bounce off the bottom then you could get ahead.

695
00:47:28,301 --> 00:47:29,286
Speaker 1: But it's still not handicapping.

696
00:47:29,306 --> 00:47:30,050
Speaker 1: it is something different.

697
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:30,613
Speaker 0: it is different.

698
00:47:30,894 --> 00:47:31,980
Speaker 1: so an example.

699
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,149
Speaker 1: That's also not strictly handicapping.

700
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:35,154
Speaker 1: that I think is the best.

701
00:47:35,174 --> 00:47:36,540
Speaker 1: I use this all the time in talks.

702
00:47:36,921 --> 00:47:38,226
Speaker 1: I used to use this even in finance.

703
00:47:38,527 --> 00:47:38,768
Speaker 1: dance.

704
00:47:38,808 --> 00:47:44,088
Speaker 1: dance revolution has the simple idea that We can both play the exact same song.

705
00:47:44,108 --> 00:47:46,739
Speaker 0: yeah different people choose different their own difficulty level.

706
00:47:46,759 --> 00:47:48,987
Speaker 1: yep And it does two gratings.

707
00:47:49,007 --> 00:47:53,040
Speaker 1: your letter grade is based on how well you did based on that difficulty.

708
00:47:53,502 --> 00:47:54,225
Speaker 1: So we could both get.

709
00:47:54,265 --> 00:48:04,695
Speaker 1: so I could do baby mode and get an A and Scott does maniac mode and also get an Egg because we both did really well Relative to what we expected right, but if you did maniac mode you get an a.

710
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:07,123
Speaker 0: your score number is gonna be Astronomical.

711
00:48:07,143 --> 00:48:08,428
Speaker 1: keeps track of both.

712
00:48:08,448 --> 00:48:13,733
Speaker 0: compare because you're you guys got your bed so many more notes to hit usually And you know more difficult in DDR.

713
00:48:13,753 --> 00:48:19,620
Speaker 0: There's more arrows that yeah I've never seen a song where there's more a great where the greater difficulty had less steps.

714
00:48:20,363 --> 00:48:24,680
Speaker 0: So there's more arrows which means you get a higher streak which means you can get more chain.

715
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:26,471
Speaker 0: You know perfects, which you know.

716
00:48:26,511 --> 00:48:27,980
Speaker 0: it's more opportunities to get points.

717
00:48:28,662 --> 00:48:31,413
Speaker 0: You're always gonna have a higher score and a higher difficulty in DDR.

718
00:48:31,594 --> 00:48:34,488
Speaker 0: yep, and well again No, unless you miss all the arrow.

719
00:48:34,628 --> 00:48:43,024
Speaker 1: not strictly handicapping by most of these definitions But it does serve the purpose of allowing two players a disparate skill to have a reasonably interesting Competition with each other.

720
00:48:43,044 --> 00:48:49,445
Speaker 0: well DDR again is also a lot like golf and bowling where you're not competing Directly against the other person.

721
00:48:49,465 --> 00:48:52,595
Speaker 0: you're not like interfering with their arrows like it's tennis or something right.

722
00:48:52,615 --> 00:49:01,080
Speaker 0: you know if there's Tetris where you're You couldn't drop anything on anyone else, then that would be like golf and bowling, but because I said tennis before that was wrong.

723
00:49:02,562 --> 00:49:04,155
Speaker 0: But DDR is like golf and bowling.

724
00:49:04,195 --> 00:49:07,910
Speaker 0: it's individual It's you just dance and they just happen to be next to you, but you're not.

725
00:49:08,813 --> 00:49:10,599
Speaker 0: you're not interacting in any way in the game.

726
00:49:11,607 --> 00:49:12,800
Speaker 1: Well, let's just step on each other.

727
00:49:13,001 --> 00:49:16,456
Speaker 0: It's just am I better at dancing the song that I was the last time I did so?

728
00:49:16,496 --> 00:49:19,520
Speaker 1: what overwatch does Again, it's adjacent to all these things.

729
00:49:19,901 --> 00:49:21,928
Speaker 1: It's it's also adjacent to matchmaking.

730
00:49:22,329 --> 00:49:27,780
Speaker 1: if you make a custom game like you and a bunch of your friends well matchmaking is the reason I think a lot of people avoid handicapping.

731
00:49:27,941 --> 00:49:31,460
Speaker 0: We just don't put people of disparate skill levels in the same game together.

732
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,082
Speaker 0: That's a good point.

733
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:34,429
Speaker 0: you can just matchmake instead of handicap.

734
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:38,260
Speaker 0: with online play the handicapping would only be necessary for local play.

735
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,049
Speaker 0: There's no place tournament play where you don't want it.

736
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:52,660
Speaker 1: one thing that handicapping would do better than matchmaking is handicapping would More routinely allow low skill players to interact with the strategies of high skill players.

737
00:49:52,821 --> 00:50:03,668
Speaker 0: I think that a good thing that games could do if you have low player counts Even if you're if you're a a game that's not popular yet And you don't have enough people playing online to matchmake.

738
00:50:03,728 --> 00:50:14,720
Speaker 0: well or be you just have an off hour of the day where your game Is medium popular and like you're not able to get enough people for your matchmaking system is to then incorporate be like okay?

739
00:50:15,202 --> 00:50:19,562
Speaker 0: You know we don't have enough people playing right now or ever Right?

740
00:50:19,883 --> 00:50:26,897
Speaker 0: then you put turn handicapping on to make the matchmake happen, and then if you've got enough players We don't need the handicap don't do it.

741
00:50:28,645 --> 00:50:31,775
Speaker 1: If you make a custom game is it randomly assigns your teams.

742
00:50:31,855 --> 00:50:32,798
Speaker 1: you can set them in advance.

743
00:50:32,918 --> 00:50:36,064
Speaker 1: you play your match Whichever team won.

744
00:50:36,806 --> 00:50:45,618
Speaker 1: the better players from that team based on the game's metric are swapped into the team that lost From and the worst players on that team are swapped into the team that won.

745
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,300
Speaker 1: and Every game you play with the same group of people it continuously rebalances.

746
00:50:50,822 --> 00:50:52,209
Speaker 1: Just among those two teams.

747
00:50:52,229 --> 00:50:59,160
Speaker 1: there were kind of strike mods that did that back in the day Yep, where you keep and they were awful because I figured out how to game them to get myself put on the good team.

748
00:50:59,221 --> 00:51:04,414
Speaker 0: I remember what people would do is we'd be like Like you would play a match, and then you would like vote balance.

749
00:51:04,454 --> 00:51:07,229
Speaker 0: They'd be like mods on the server Yeah, and everyone would be like yes.

750
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:07,692
Speaker 0: No yes.

751
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:08,396
Speaker 0: No yes, no.

752
00:51:08,497 --> 00:51:17,343
Speaker 1: you notice All the people on the winning team would vote no and all the people on the losing team would vote yes And if there's a simple majority voting yes Then he would shuffle up the teams According to score.

753
00:51:17,384 --> 00:51:31,107
Speaker 0: basically put the first place player the strongest player on team one the second strongest player on team two the third place Player on team one and just go back and forth with it to sort of split the teams in half that way According to your stats from the most recent game.

754
00:51:31,127 --> 00:51:39,931
Speaker 1: so arguably some board games have a very very primitive form of handicapping Mm-hmm in the sense that usually in a board game.

755
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:40,373
Speaker 0: There's all.

756
00:51:40,413 --> 00:51:42,580
Speaker 0: sometimes the youngest player goes first.

757
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:44,092
Speaker 1: That's what I get into in games.

758
00:51:44,273 --> 00:51:55,615
Speaker 1: usually in a board game The player who goes first is either at an advantage or a disadvantage just by the nature of games Unless the games are perfectly somehow simultaneous symmetrical, but most games aren't like that.

759
00:51:56,117 --> 00:52:06,044
Speaker 1: so typically Games will say something like the more experienced player goes first or whoever won the previous game Goes first.

760
00:52:06,767 --> 00:52:08,613
Speaker 1: that is technically handicapping.

761
00:52:08,633 --> 00:52:10,620
Speaker 1: It's just very limited in scale.

762
00:52:11,263 --> 00:52:16,849
Speaker 1: I feel like board games could actually do a little bit more with that like a tiny like.

763
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:29,404
Speaker 1: imagine a board game that came with some easy mechanism if you play a game like teeny repeatedly with friends where Whichever one of your friend is one the most games and it even gave you a way to keep track of that Goes first or goes last or

764
00:52:29,525 --> 00:52:30,688
Speaker 0: I mean too many games.

765
00:52:30,749 --> 00:52:34,520
Speaker 0: I think have the baby modes right and I'm done with baby modes.

766
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:40,660
Speaker 0: I'm super anti baby mode because people play the baby mode right like a grecula comes like family mode, right?

767
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:51,200
Speaker 0: It's like you play a simpler version of the game or so I would do it with like a six-year-old right or in some cases not a simpler version of a game But a completely different game that happens to use the same pieces.

768
00:52:51,421 --> 00:53:04,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, right or effectively a different game even though you may not realize it Because it looks similar and feels similar and then people play that and then they can never advance to the real game from that Right because they're just the baby game is nothing like the real game.

769
00:53:04,963 --> 00:53:07,280
Speaker 1: Well, cuz it's a different game if you want to write semantics.

770
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:13,000
Speaker 0: So, uh, I think it'd be much better to just get people playing the real game and have a handicap.

771
00:53:14,201 --> 00:53:19,440
Speaker 0: It's like okay fine, you know, you want to play a grecula, but you're a six-year-old you can play it.

772
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:20,163
Speaker 0: You can understand that.

773
00:53:20,203 --> 00:53:21,026
Speaker 0: well, maybe not six.

774
00:53:21,046 --> 00:53:21,809
Speaker 0: You're a ten-year-old.

775
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:23,254
Speaker 0: You can understand the rules.

776
00:53:23,374 --> 00:53:31,800
Speaker 0: You can get the game going but you Are gonna lose to me guaranteed pretty much unless you're a genius or something.

777
00:53:32,942 --> 00:53:34,708
Speaker 0: Let you start with like a pile of wheat.

778
00:53:34,949 --> 00:53:35,210
Speaker 1: Yep.

779
00:53:35,711 --> 00:53:37,076
Speaker 0: It's like I saw.

780
00:53:37,096 --> 00:53:38,100
Speaker 1: I was watching a boy.

781
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:38,483
Speaker 0: You know what?

782
00:53:38,523 --> 00:53:39,772
Speaker 0: You never have to feed your people.

783
00:53:39,833 --> 00:53:40,740
Speaker 0: Otherwise, it's the same.

784
00:53:40,981 --> 00:53:44,380
Speaker 1: I was watching a biking channel and it's a pretty good YouTube channel.

785
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:45,725
Speaker 1: I have linked to it a couple times before.

786
00:53:46,107 --> 00:53:51,512
Speaker 1: but they got one of those cheating bikes that has the hidden motor Mm-hmm, and they wrote it to see what it was like.

787
00:53:51,573 --> 00:53:57,351
Speaker 1: and they were like, wow, it's weird Yeah but they actually made a good point about a pretty good legitimate use for that.

788
00:53:57,753 --> 00:54:03,020
Speaker 1: and the legitimate uses say you're a Serious biker and you have a more amateur biker friend.

789
00:54:03,781 --> 00:54:17,489
Speaker 1: you could use that to have long-form races with friends while giving your friend a Mechanical advantage to keep it interesting like to let them have a chance of keeping up with you Right or I mean even without a race.

790
00:54:17,589 --> 00:54:18,293
Speaker 0: It's like okay.

791
00:54:18,393 --> 00:54:19,237
Speaker 0: I want to go and ride.

792
00:54:19,841 --> 00:54:20,987
Speaker 0: Yeah, I want to ride.

793
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:23,459
Speaker 1: my friends are doing centuries and I can only go 70 miles, right?

794
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,927
Speaker 0: I want to ride a hundred miles.

795
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:27,320
Speaker 0: My friend can only ride like 40 because they're weak.

796
00:54:27,781 --> 00:54:32,295
Speaker 0: we'll just give them a motorized bike and now the friend is gonna make the hundred and they can.

797
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:37,640
Speaker 0: we can all stay together and Get the enjoyment and see all the sites even though our physical fitness levels are different.

798
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,527
Speaker 0: It's not a competition at all.

799
00:54:39,707 --> 00:54:43,160
Speaker 1: matchmaking says only play games with people of the same skill.

800
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:51,219
Speaker 1: Handicapping says you get to play that everyone plays the same game and we just change how we determine the winner.

801
00:54:51,239 --> 00:54:58,290
Speaker 1: or And then rubber banding and all those other things are more like let's make sure the game is always close No matter how skilled or unskilled the players are.

802
00:54:58,692 --> 00:55:00,260
Speaker 1: so there's a lot of different nuances.

803
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:06,919
Speaker 1: I think the moral of the show because I can smell food in there and I'm really hungry and I'm trying to wrap this up Is that

804
00:55:07,961 --> 00:55:08,161
Speaker 0: All

805
00:55:08,182 --> 00:55:14,420
Speaker 1: of these different kinds of ways to make disparate skill players have a fun time are tools in your chest

806
00:55:15,143 --> 00:55:16,611
Speaker 0: And you should have your air hockey problem.

807
00:55:16,652 --> 00:55:25,060
Speaker 0: Yep to solve the air hockey problem But I think the handicapping is the least used in the nerdy games the video games the tabletop games.

808
00:55:25,482 --> 00:55:26,065
Speaker 0: You know the.

809
00:55:26,125 --> 00:55:33,240
Speaker 0: the rubber banding has been used quite a bit especially in the board games Even though arguably rubber banding isn't rubber banding and good players will take advantage of it.

810
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:46,940
Speaker 0: The matchmaking has been used extensively in the board game department and the handicapping has been barely touched in any nerd gaming Department whatsoever and we need to bring that in and it ultimately you need to bring it in big-time.

811
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,948
Speaker 0: Definitely there is a such thing as too much.

812
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:52,218
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's severely underused.

813
00:55:52,258 --> 00:55:59,634
Speaker 1: right now The tricky part is again And this is what actually it's homework for all of you listening to geek nights because you You listen to our show for a lot of the like game design stuff.

814
00:55:59,655 --> 00:56:02,346
Speaker 1: We talked about Pick a game you like and cut.

815
00:56:02,366 --> 00:56:08,950
Speaker 1: try to come up with a way to handicap it because frankly it is really difficult Like really really difficult.

816
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:11,420
Speaker 1: I mean any except for solitaire games.

817
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:14,860
Speaker 0: I mean any any any board game where there's victory points.

818
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:20,300
Speaker 0: You can just start by the basic give someone victory point true Just like you start with ten points you go a cargo zone.

819
00:56:20,501 --> 00:56:21,065
Speaker 0: We'll just give you.

820
00:56:21,105 --> 00:56:22,192
Speaker 0: I can beat you by twenty here.

821
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:22,837
Speaker 0: You got twenty four.

822
00:56:22,877 --> 00:56:23,259
Speaker 1: Here's one.

823
00:56:23,601 --> 00:56:26,760
Speaker 1: How would we candy handicap advance wars so you and I could play with each other?

824
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:33,933
Speaker 0: you could just basically run through like turns of the game and Let me go like conquer a city while you sit there do nothing.

825
00:56:34,174 --> 00:56:35,500
Speaker 1: Oh just like start you with extra biz.

826
00:56:35,922 --> 00:56:37,390
Speaker 0: I think advance was actually does.

827
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:39,160
Speaker 0: let you start one person with more money.

828
00:56:39,382 --> 00:56:39,926
Speaker 1: It actually does.

829
00:56:40,168 --> 00:56:41,540
Speaker 0: it also start someone with more money.

830
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,768
Speaker 1: It also has a number of we never played.

831
00:56:43,808 --> 00:56:45,413
Speaker 0: it also lets because it's asymmetrical.

832
00:56:45,454 --> 00:56:50,500
Speaker 0: you can let someone have the strong OP character So actually could be Sturm and you could be like, you know, someone crappy.

833
00:56:50,822 --> 00:56:52,169
Speaker 1: Ah, but so, you know, we should have done that.

834
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:52,733
Speaker 1: We never did.

835
00:56:52,773 --> 00:56:53,980
Speaker 1: We always played on symmetric maps.

836
00:56:54,261 --> 00:56:56,387
Speaker 1: We should have played on the maps that are.

837
00:56:56,868 --> 00:56:59,255
Speaker 1: one player is like way strong.

838
00:56:59,376 --> 00:57:00,479
Speaker 0: We played two versus one.

839
00:57:01,062 --> 00:57:01,607
Speaker 1: We'd.

840
00:57:01,749 --> 00:57:02,899
Speaker 1: I've tried, you know, I've done that.

841
00:57:03,905 --> 00:57:06,698
Speaker 1: I did that before at RIT with not you because you wouldn't do it.

842
00:57:07,161 --> 00:57:07,965
Speaker 1: I think was Greg and Scott.

843
00:57:07,985 --> 00:57:10,480
Speaker 1: forget who I did it with but I won every time anyway.

844
00:57:11,162 --> 00:57:21,360
Speaker 0: Well, I think those maps were designed in such a way that the one had more stuff to account for the fact that they were Yeah, and the three were small small three small ones versus one big one.

845
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:26,785
Speaker 1: Here's the big three small ones versus one small one, even if you find an easy way like, okay We'll move victory points.

846
00:57:27,006 --> 00:57:29,058
Speaker 1: The hard part is how do you do it?

847
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:35,176
Speaker 1: Methodically to make the handicapped game fair and balanced right?

848
00:57:35,276 --> 00:57:36,560
Speaker 0: I think there's a different skill.

849
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:42,645
Speaker 0: I think you just have to play the game a few times and See what the scores are and be like, okay My average score was this.

850
00:57:42,666 --> 00:57:43,510
Speaker 0: your average score was that.

851
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:44,395
Speaker 0: your average score was that.

852
00:57:44,817 --> 00:57:45,420
Speaker 0: so on average?

853
00:57:45,542 --> 00:57:46,399
Speaker 0: I beat you by ten.

854
00:57:46,783 --> 00:57:51,230
Speaker 0: So we're gonna give you ten points to start the nice game Right and we'll give you five because you lose.

855
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:53,300
Speaker 0: I keep I keep winning right, you know.

856
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,986
Speaker 0: Just see what everyone's average scores are.

857
00:57:55,448 --> 00:58:06,180
Speaker 1: So if you want our real starting spot That's not your super perfect for if you want a real challenge This is something that if you if you solved this problem, you could probably make a lot of money.

858
00:58:06,702 --> 00:58:11,220
Speaker 1: There is no good or effective handicapping system for tennis?

859
00:58:12,021 --> 00:58:17,000
Speaker 1: No, not really and a lot of people have been trying to design one for a long time.

860
00:58:17,241 --> 00:58:17,622
Speaker 0: It's hard.

861
00:58:18,063 --> 00:58:29,058
Speaker 0: if you can if you can crack the tennis not I tried if you could I mean if I tried and failed I mean if you could do it then you could bet on tennis and win and get money at the casino yeah, but you could also like.

862
00:58:31,502 --> 00:58:36,520
Speaker 1: This is a problem that if you can solve it you could probably make a career out of being the person who handicapped.

863
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,819
Speaker 0: I mean the fundamental problem is like, okay, so I play tennis against Federer.
