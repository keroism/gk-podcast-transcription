1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,058
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, April 14th, 2022.

2
00:00:10,058 --> 00:00:10,319
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,656 --> 00:00:13,965
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,130
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights tonight on the Geek Nights Book Club.

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,057
Speaker 0: We are talking about N.K.

6
00:00:19,098 --> 00:00:21,266
Speaker 0: Jemisin's "The City We

7
00:00:21,306 --> 00:00:21,829
Speaker 0: Became.".

8
00:00:24,011 --> 00:00:25,047
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

9
00:00:27,351 --> 00:00:32,409
Speaker 0: Not gonna belabor the point about how refreshing it was to read a book that was written in this millennium.

10
00:00:34,293 --> 00:00:37,150
Speaker 0: In a language that I already speak without requiring a translation.

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,100
Speaker 1: Well, the original language of the book is...

12
00:00:41,111 --> 00:00:43,930
Speaker 0: It's original language is a language that I understand well.

13
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,190
Speaker 0: That this book did not take long to read.

14
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,280
Speaker 0: Partly because it was really good.

15
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,168
Speaker 0: Partly because I feel like...

16
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,270
Speaker 1: You're comparing it against a book that took forever to read.

17
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:55,605
Speaker 0: Yep, like I enjoyed "The Tale of

18
00:00:55,626 --> 00:00:55,869
Speaker 0: Genji."

19
00:00:56,011 --> 00:00:59,870
Speaker 0: Just like if the only bike I had was a Fixie, like it's better than nothing, I'd ride that Fixie around.

20
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,629
Speaker 1: I didn't enjoy "Tale of Genji" as much as this book.

21
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,710
Speaker 0: Oh no, but if my choice was don't bike or bike on a Fixie, I would bike on a Fixie.

22
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:11,770
Speaker 0: But imagine if I was forced to bike on a Fixie for like a year, and then someone handed me my old bike back.

23
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:12,788
Speaker 1: Yeah.

24
00:01:15,021 --> 00:01:15,310
Speaker 1: So yeah.

25
00:01:16,691 --> 00:01:19,690
Speaker 1: So the story with this book is I knew this book existed.

26
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,163
Speaker 1: And I knew that it was, you know, a book by N.K.

27
00:01:24,203 --> 00:01:25,930
Speaker 1: Jemisin, who we're already a fan of, right?

28
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:27,790
Speaker 1: We read the whole "Broken Earth" already.

29
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:33,469
Speaker 0: Yeah, literally one of my favorite science fiction/fantasy trilogies of all time.

30
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:40,808
Speaker 0: With the caveat that I read it very recently, and I think it'll stand the test of time, but I'm not 100% sure.

31
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:45,010
Speaker 0: So in a decade, if I say the same thing, you know that's a rock solid trilogy.

32
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:47,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it's really, really good.

33
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,630
Speaker 1: I just don't, you know, but it's not like at Earthsea level, right?

34
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:58,490
Speaker 1: It's, you know, even if they might both be S-tier, but they're still ranked relatively within the S-tier.

35
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,170
Speaker 0: I'd have to go read some Earthsea again.

36
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,889
Speaker 0: You know what, they're within knife-fighting distance of each other.

37
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:05,790
Speaker 1: Maybe, anyway.

38
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,170
Speaker 0: Maybe a longer knife, like a short sword?

39
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:09,369
Speaker 1: Dueling distance.

40
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:13,890
Speaker 1: Well, anyway, the point is, I knew this book existed.

41
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,810
Speaker 1: And I knew, or at least I incorrectly thought it was going to be a trilogy.

42
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,990
Speaker 1: Apparently, it's going to be a duology, which is good news.

43
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,030
Speaker 0: Oh, Google still says it's going to be a trilogy.

44
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:28,690
Speaker 1: It's a duology, according to the announcement for the second book.

45
00:02:28,931 --> 00:02:32,530
Speaker 0: Something was going to be a duology that became a trilogy that became two trilogies, so.

46
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:41,169
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, I read the, there was a, recently there were, you know, like things about the second book and it said duology on it.

47
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:42,409
Speaker 1: So I'm going by that.

48
00:02:45,092 --> 00:02:51,370
Speaker 1: So I knew I was going to read this book eventually, but I was upset that Rim chose it as the book club book for, for why, right?

49
00:02:51,470 --> 00:03:03,650
Speaker 1: Number one, you know, even though it's going to be, I knew it was going to be an incredible amazing book by an author I already knew who has done no wrong that I wanted to read.

50
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,510
Speaker 1: I was like, we already did a book by this author, right?

51
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,369
Speaker 1: We should be doing, I feel like we should be doing a new author every time.

52
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,029
Speaker 0: Though, unlike things of the day, we do not have a rule about it.

53
00:03:12,631 --> 00:03:15,730
Speaker 1: We don't have a rule about it, but you know, and I can't control what Rim picks.

54
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:25,129
Speaker 1: I mean, if he actually, you know, sincerely picks account of Monte Cristo, it's like, well, I've been getting ready for another book club three years from now.

55
00:03:25,392 --> 00:03:26,449
Speaker 0: Not just because you said it.

56
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:31,669
Speaker 0: I've been low key having this small but strange urge to read that book again.

57
00:03:33,031 --> 00:03:35,050
Speaker 1: I'm going to have that strange urge to play breath of the wild.

58
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,383
Speaker 0: It's been more like 20 years.

59
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:37,510
Speaker 0: God damn.

60
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,210
Speaker 0: It has been 20 years since I read that book.

61
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,590
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway, so, uh, that was reason number one.

62
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:47,149
Speaker 1: And reason number two is because I knew it was going to be more than one book.

63
00:03:47,911 --> 00:03:53,910
Speaker 1: I lately, you know, I really like to wait until a thing is done and then go for the whole thing.

64
00:03:53,970 --> 00:04:03,330
Speaker 1: I really am not a fan of, you know, read one, wait and read the second one, because what happens is, you know, I don't remember enough.

65
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,987
Speaker 1: So like, for example, Prince of nothing, which I assume is anymore.

66
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:07,989
Speaker 0: Then book two came out.

67
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:08,910
Speaker 0: I read book one again.

68
00:04:08,971 --> 00:04:10,390
Speaker 0: Then I read book two, book three.

69
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:10,844
Speaker 0: Exactly.

70
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,370
Speaker 0: I skimmed through book one.

71
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,168
Speaker 0: I read book two again, and then I read book three.

72
00:04:15,334 --> 00:04:15,630
Speaker 1: Exactly.

73
00:04:15,831 --> 00:04:20,209
Speaker 1: So I want to avoid that and just be able to, you know, just read all the things once.

74
00:04:20,781 --> 00:04:20,950
Speaker 1: Right.

75
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,550
Speaker 1: Especially with a book that takes more time, you know, time and whatnot.

76
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:33,944
Speaker 1: So, uh, but other than that, you know, every other, you know, it was, I had reasons to not pick it as a book club book, but I had absolutely no reasons to be against the book itself.

77
00:04:34,231 --> 00:04:36,229
Speaker 1: I knew that I assumed the greatest of the book.

78
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,910
Speaker 0: I had some gnosis because Emily read the book already.

79
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:48,459
Speaker 0: And I had Emily's assurance that it ends regardless of future books at a very solid, satisfying point.

80
00:04:49,002 --> 00:04:49,707
Speaker 0: that would not lie.

81
00:04:51,031 --> 00:04:56,970
Speaker 1: This book, despite being a duology or more, we don't know, um, you can read this book.

82
00:04:57,151 --> 00:05:03,470
Speaker 1: And if it was the only book in its series and there was never any other book to follow it, you would not be upset at all.

83
00:05:03,972 --> 00:05:06,788
Speaker 1: It is a complete self-contained ending thing.

84
00:05:07,851 --> 00:05:13,150
Speaker 1: It does leave, you know, a state, you know, a state of a world, you know, builds a world.

85
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:19,868
Speaker 1: And that world is in a particular state with, so, you know, some unresolved things in it at the end.

86
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,079
Speaker 1: Right.

87
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:30,690
Speaker 1: That would allow for continuation, but they're not things that, like, you know, are like enormous, like you must know or otherwise you don't feel like it's over.

88
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:38,038
Speaker 1: Like, it's like the story is over and, you know, of the characters, at least the major conflict of this first book is.

89
00:05:38,058 --> 00:05:45,350
Speaker 0: it has that feeling, which is actually kind of literal in terms of how it's shown at the end of a fantasy book that ends in the middle.

90
00:05:45,591 --> 00:05:49,890
Speaker 0: And the final chapter is like a battle has been won or something.

91
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,830
Speaker 0: And then the heroes are like looking out over the shore at the looming enemy to come.

92
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:56,090
Speaker 1: Exactly.

93
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,929
Speaker 1: So it would be like if someone wrote a book about a battle in a war.

94
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:00,670
Speaker 1: Right.

95
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:06,010
Speaker 1: And the book, the book starts when the battle is starting or like the precursor to the battle.

96
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:06,326
Speaker 1: Right.

97
00:06:06,571 --> 00:06:10,630
Speaker 1: And then the book ends after the battle is completely over.

98
00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:15,930
Speaker 1: And like this, you know, every the battlefield is cleaned up and the war is still going on.

99
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:19,510
Speaker 1: That battle wasn't the ultimate battle that ended the war, clearly.

100
00:06:19,872 --> 00:06:21,590
Speaker 1: But you got a complete story.

101
00:06:22,271 --> 00:06:27,310
Speaker 1: And, you know, even though the questions of the greater situation are still out there, you're not upset.

102
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:30,230
Speaker 1: Just reading that one story right of within.

103
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:30,948
Speaker 0: Yep.

104
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:31,647
Speaker 1: Okay.

105
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:36,048
Speaker 0: So this book, remember, this is we haven't done these in a while because, again, she took a while.

106
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:43,050
Speaker 0: The Geek Nights Book Club is a book club, meaning we're assuming very shortly that you have already read this book.

107
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,310
Speaker 0: We're going to talk about this book as two people who have read this book.

108
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,630
Speaker 0: And we're assuming that all of you have read this book.

109
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:56,510
Speaker 0: So if you have not read this book, other than a little bit of explanation we're going to give in the very beginning, you're probably going to be completely lost.

110
00:06:57,032 --> 00:06:59,690
Speaker 0: And we're just going to spoil a whole bunch of the book.

111
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,628
Speaker 0: We're going to talk about it.

112
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:07,090
Speaker 0: So I highly encourage you, if you have not read The City We Became, to stop listening to this and go read this book.

113
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,168
Speaker 0: It'll take you like a week.

114
00:07:09,255 --> 00:07:09,530
Speaker 0: I swear.

115
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:20,410
Speaker 1: I don't, you know, again, I don't personally believe in spoilers, but if I did, I really think that this book only has one thing that's spoilable in it.

116
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:24,989
Speaker 0: Nothing surprised me except one thing that I could have picked on.

117
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,990
Speaker 1: The one biggest, yes, the one biggest thing.

118
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,628
Speaker 1: That's the thing, right?

119
00:07:30,312 --> 00:07:31,876
Speaker 1: One big, big thing.

120
00:07:31,896 --> 00:07:36,370
Speaker 1: that was usually I'm I'm the person who sees everything coming, right?

121
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:39,429
Speaker 1: Because any good story is going to have foreshadowing.

122
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,030
Speaker 1: And Chekhov's guns.

123
00:07:41,475 --> 00:07:42,409
Speaker 1: And I spot those.

124
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:42,730
Speaker 1: Fuck.

125
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,070
Speaker 1: I'm like an expert at spot.

126
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:44,790
Speaker 1: We should have a game.

127
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:45,530
Speaker 1: I spotted the check.

128
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,589
Speaker 0: I spotted Chekhov's New Jersey within.

129
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,430
Speaker 1: Oh, that was the easiest one.

130
00:07:50,492 --> 00:07:51,209
Speaker 1: Forget that one.

131
00:07:51,451 --> 00:07:55,450
Speaker 0: As soon as I found out that character is from New Jersey, I was like, I know where this is going.

132
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,227
Speaker 1: Yeah.

133
00:07:56,652 --> 00:07:56,945
Speaker 1: Yeah.

134
00:07:57,192 --> 00:07:57,948
Speaker 1: No question there.

135
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:04,850
Speaker 1: But there was, you know, there's another one that there were so many hints.

136
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:05,648
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

137
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,770
Speaker 0: Billy, I figured there's about there.

138
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:08,589
Speaker 0: So I figured it out.

139
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:12,229
Speaker 0: I want to say, like, the fourth beat where it comes up.

140
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,690
Speaker 0: And at that moment, I thought, wait a minute are.

141
00:08:16,293 --> 00:08:18,470
Speaker 0: Oh, and then I thought, wow, I'm really stupid.

142
00:08:18,571 --> 00:08:21,610
Speaker 0: I really should have picked up on that earlier as I went back.

143
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,908
Speaker 0: And I felt a little as well.

144
00:08:25,364 --> 00:08:25,490
Speaker 1: Yeah.

145
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:27,169
Speaker 1: But that was the major one anyway.

146
00:08:27,311 --> 00:08:28,310
Speaker 1: So what the hell is this book?

147
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:31,070
Speaker 1: So the title of the book is The City We Became.

148
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,770
Speaker 1: I knew it was a book about New York, right?

149
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,254
Speaker 1: Where N.K.

150
00:08:34,274 --> 00:08:34,880
Speaker 1: Jemisin lives?

151
00:08:34,921 --> 00:08:35,870
Speaker 1: in Brooklyn, right?

152
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,289
Speaker 1: You know, we live in Queens anyway.

153
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,130
Speaker 1: And I didn't know anything else other than that.

154
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:44,788
Speaker 1: It was going to be good.

155
00:08:45,011 --> 00:08:48,350
Speaker 1: So oh, and I knew there was some sort of fantastical element.

156
00:08:48,911 --> 00:08:54,990
Speaker 1: It turns out that the title is a genius title because it has, you know, at least two meanings to it, right?

157
00:08:55,292 --> 00:08:58,190
Speaker 0: It's literal in terms of what happens in the book, how it ends.

158
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:04,369
Speaker 1: That's the one that I didn't see coming that like right away and not even in chapter one and like the prologue, right?

159
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:17,550
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, the book is literally about people who become physical avatars, embodiments of New York, literally like that person is New York City.

160
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,746
Speaker 1: That person, human being is Queens.

161
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,647
Speaker 1: That's who they are, right?

162
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:27,950
Speaker 1: The same way that, you know, I don't know, you know, other mythological figures, right?

163
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,808
Speaker 1: The way that I don't know.

164
00:09:30,371 --> 00:09:34,785
Speaker 0: I this is the worst possible example, but it just came front of mind because it's very good.

165
00:09:35,192 --> 00:09:38,950
Speaker 0: The way deities work in forgotten realms in Dungeons and Dragons.

166
00:09:39,353 --> 00:09:41,530
Speaker 0: It is exactly literally how deities work.

167
00:09:41,811 --> 00:09:43,403
Speaker 1: A bunch of people, the belief, the belief part.

168
00:09:44,397 --> 00:09:44,569
Speaker 0: Yeah.

169
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:45,373
Speaker 0: Well, the idea

170
00:09:45,393 --> 00:09:46,497
Speaker 1: is kind of a little bit

171
00:09:46,637 --> 00:09:59,869
Speaker 0: that a person will live their life a certain way and whatever God they live their life closest to, they kind of go to that afterlife and eventually by living in a place that's run by that God, they become indistinguishable from that God.

172
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,009
Speaker 0: Like they would make the same decisions that God would do.

173
00:10:02,312 --> 00:10:03,790
Speaker 0: They would say the same thing that God would say.

174
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,068
Speaker 0: And at that point they just become that God.

175
00:10:07,631 --> 00:10:10,430
Speaker 0: They represent that idea or that concept here.

176
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:21,450
Speaker 0: It's more like all the people in the history of a city together sort of become this meta organism or this meta idea that is literally its own thing that no individual fully controls.

177
00:10:21,911 --> 00:10:22,390
Speaker 1: Like, right.

178
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:26,110
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, it's a common literary, you know, mechanism, right?

179
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,390
Speaker 1: A personification, right?

180
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:32,130
Speaker 1: Of having some character that represents, you know, some idea, right?

181
00:10:32,251 --> 00:10:33,350
Speaker 1: Animal Farm, whatever.

182
00:10:33,895 --> 00:10:34,030
Speaker 1: Right.

183
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:40,390
Speaker 1: But in Animal Farm, the characters aren't literally the thing they are representing.

184
00:10:40,653 --> 00:10:42,070
Speaker 1: They are just symbolic.

185
00:10:42,271 --> 00:10:44,130
Speaker 0: Well, here they are both figuratively and literally.

186
00:10:44,251 --> 00:10:48,390
Speaker 0: And I got to tell you, my favorite media anywhere my entire life.

187
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:54,149
Speaker 0: The thing I like the most is when a story works on an allegorical and a literal level equally well.

188
00:10:54,771 --> 00:10:55,490
Speaker 0: That gets me going.

189
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:58,830
Speaker 0: The only thing that gets me going more than that is precursor technology.

190
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:08,070
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, imagine if like you had a character that represented, you know, I don't know, democracy in your book.

191
00:11:08,382 --> 00:11:08,570
Speaker 1: Right.

192
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:15,639
Speaker 1: And then someone punched them and suddenly there were revolutions and dictators rose to power because that person got hurt.

193
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:22,589
Speaker 0: when Staten Island fucks up Sao Paulo and then it cuts to like freeways, like just chaos ensuing in Sao Paulo.

194
00:11:23,364 --> 00:11:23,530
Speaker 1: Yeah.

195
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:28,090
Speaker 1: In Sao Paulo, Brazil, they were like, there's a person who is the physical embodiment of Sao Paulo.

196
00:11:28,253 --> 00:11:29,090
Speaker 1: They got injured.

197
00:11:29,691 --> 00:11:38,966
Speaker 1: And then the actual city of Sao Paulo in Brazil in the book, not in real life, right, was having like earthquakes or floods or, you know, disasters and things were getting fucked up.

198
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,301
Speaker 1: And it's like that.

199
00:11:40,463 --> 00:11:41,310
Speaker 1: it's literal.

200
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:42,588
Speaker 1: And that's that's a lot of fun.

201
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:43,376
Speaker 0: Yeah.

202
00:11:44,031 --> 00:11:52,047
Speaker 0: But it also is arguably a spoiler for the book because the whole point of the book is they're they're like growing into this role and becoming the avatars of the city and becoming the city.

203
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:56,650
Speaker 0: But it's in the past tense because they succeed in the book.

204
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,050
Speaker 0: The book ends with them succeeding.

205
00:11:58,917 --> 00:11:59,208
Speaker 1: Kind of.

206
00:11:59,310 --> 00:11:59,427
Speaker 1: Yeah.

207
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:06,290
Speaker 0: Well, mostly, I mean, the part of the city that didn't succeed arguably is not a part of the city, which is kind of part of what the book was saying.

208
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:06,567
Speaker 1: Right.

209
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:15,830
Speaker 1: But, you know, the book is about right, you know, in in the mythology of the book, the world that is built is that, you know, not cities don't just have these avatars automatically, right?

210
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:16,927
Speaker 1: The cities become born.

211
00:12:17,391 --> 00:12:25,550
Speaker 0: Well, it makes the point that there are only two cities like this in the entire Western hemisphere at the time that the book takes place.

212
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:30,529
Speaker 0: And there were a handful that had ever even appeared in that hemisphere up to that point in human history.

213
00:12:31,324 --> 00:12:31,470
Speaker 1: Yeah.

214
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:35,770
Speaker 1: And some failed to appear or, you know, other other things happened and whatnot.

215
00:12:35,854 --> 00:12:36,045
Speaker 1: Yeah.

216
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:46,410
Speaker 1: So, yeah, it's this it's the story of like New York being born, not, you know, but not being born in the way, you know, like go back to, you know, New Amsterdam.

217
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:46,599
Speaker 1: Right.

218
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:53,468
Speaker 1: But being born as, you know, a living embodiment city the way that other, you know, really big cities were.

219
00:12:53,717 --> 00:12:53,865
Speaker 0: Yep.

220
00:12:54,211 --> 00:12:56,710
Speaker 0: And there is there is actually interesting enough.

221
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,070
Speaker 0: There's this idea of like global alpha cities.

222
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,890
Speaker 0: There's a thing I learned about from a doctor.

223
00:13:02,392 --> 00:13:05,730
Speaker 0: She was the wife of my boss at a job I had way, way back.

224
00:13:06,272 --> 00:13:22,070
Speaker 0: What she studied specifically was the concept of global cities and the idea that there are two cities on Earth for real that are global in a sense that makes them different, unique and transcendent from all other cities and all other ways humans have ever lived.

225
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:29,210
Speaker 0: And it's just the idea of like studying what makes those cities different and why like why do they act so differently in the real world?

226
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:31,889
Speaker 0: And those two cities are London and New York.

227
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:34,224
Speaker 1: Mm hmm.

228
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:34,953
Speaker 0: And it's a whole.

229
00:13:34,994 --> 00:13:44,248
Speaker 0: I'm not going to try to talk about the theory in detail, because one, my knowledge on it is based on two or three conversations with a doctor who wrote theses on this and the Wikipedia page about it.

230
00:13:44,814 --> 00:13:45,830
Speaker 0: So go read that Wikipedia page.

231
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,764
Speaker 0: You'll already know more than me.

232
00:13:47,651 --> 00:13:52,470
Speaker 1: So anyway, there you know, there's a lot I've read quite, you know, in terms of New York media.

233
00:13:52,918 --> 00:13:53,150
Speaker 1: Right.

234
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:58,570
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, as a New York person, you know, I quite enjoy New York media.

235
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:03,468
Speaker 1: You know, there's a lot of people who've made books, movies, TV shows that are like love letters to New York.

236
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:04,801
Speaker 0: I mean, Cavalier and Clay, right.

237
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:08,290
Speaker 1: One of our early book club books.

238
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:08,650
Speaker 1: Right.

239
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,069
Speaker 1: Was was about 20th century New York.

240
00:14:11,461 --> 00:14:11,710
Speaker 1: Right.

241
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:20,488
Speaker 1: You have Seinfeld, you have fucking Tale of Two Cities, Dog Day Afternoon, Ghostbusters.

242
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:22,950
Speaker 0: Oh, Ghostbusters.

243
00:14:23,972 --> 00:14:24,081
Speaker 1: Right.

244
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,028
Speaker 1: There's tons of them.

245
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,509
Speaker 1: Right.

246
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:32,870
Speaker 1: And I feel like, though, most of those that I just mentioned are about an older New York.

247
00:14:33,282 --> 00:14:33,490
Speaker 1: Right.

248
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:37,250
Speaker 1: You know, the Cavalier and Clay is definitely about a 20th century New York.

249
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:47,130
Speaker 0: That is something that was so refreshing to read, not just a contemporary book using contemporary language, but a book that is about New York as it is right now when I am living in it.

250
00:14:47,691 --> 00:14:52,730
Speaker 0: So true and real to what New York is actually like to be here.

251
00:14:52,990 --> 00:15:03,030
Speaker 0: It was like the way the characters talk, the way things are described, the fact that halfway through one word of where the primary avatar was.

252
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,890
Speaker 0: I immediately knew exactly.

253
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:08,210
Speaker 1: I knew I was 100 percent correct about where they were immediately.

254
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,548
Speaker 0: Highland newspapers that are always like, I know where that is.

255
00:15:11,331 --> 00:15:12,969
Speaker 1: Yeah, I knew exactly where that was.

256
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:13,689
Speaker 1: No question.

257
00:15:14,952 --> 00:15:20,729
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's like, you know, people love cell phones, like everything described very, very realistically.

258
00:15:21,623 --> 00:15:21,790
Speaker 1: Yeah.

259
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:29,889
Speaker 1: But I mean, that's, you know, I think all people, right, who enjoy stories, at least have any sort of emotion to them.

260
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:36,850
Speaker 1: You enjoy hearing people or talk or tell stories about a thing.

261
00:15:37,111 --> 00:15:46,049
Speaker 1: And when you have that, I don't know if there's like a German word for it, some compound, right, where it's like, you know, someone's talking about something and you're like, yep, that's how that is.

262
00:15:46,474 --> 00:15:47,970
Speaker 1: I know that thing you're talking about.

263
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,810
Speaker 1: You're saying exactly how the thing is.

264
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:53,290
Speaker 1: And I know that same exact feeling that you're describing.

265
00:15:53,471 --> 00:16:00,389
Speaker 0: The reason a lot of people watch reviews of movies they've already seen and love because they want someone else to talk about it and they just want to soak that in.

266
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:12,209
Speaker 1: It's like you have found, you know, there's a thing that you have inside of you and someone else reveals to you that, you know, without any doubt, they have that thing inside of them as well.

267
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:18,369
Speaker 1: That knowledge, that experience, you have a shared, you know, commonality with them, some shared humanity with them.

268
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:22,990
Speaker 1: And it's not just that, but that it's aligning so perfectly.

269
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:30,388
Speaker 1: You experience the same thing right as them in the same way and have the same feelings about it.

270
00:16:30,742 --> 00:16:30,930
Speaker 1: Right.

271
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,570
Speaker 1: It's like you were just in like this perfect alignment with someone.

272
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:33,770
Speaker 1: Right.

273
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:44,608
Speaker 1: So if you're a New York 21st century person and you read this book, there are just so many things in it that are like, yes, that's exactly how that is.

274
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:46,476
Speaker 1: This is my.

275
00:16:46,778 --> 00:16:51,550
Speaker 1: I could have written, you know, if I had any writing skills, I could have written this because that's the feelings that I have.

276
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:57,528
Speaker 1: If I could have translated them into words and with any amount of skill, you know, which I could not.

277
00:16:57,853 --> 00:16:57,967
Speaker 1: Right.

278
00:16:58,850 --> 00:16:59,969
Speaker 1: This is what it would say.

279
00:17:00,455 --> 00:17:00,685
Speaker 1: Yeah.

280
00:17:01,011 --> 00:17:07,530
Speaker 0: I could open this book to a random page and read a passage and then immediately talk a lot about that part of New York City.

281
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:12,710
Speaker 1: I in fact, I went to my kindle here and I had three highlighted sections.

282
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,230
Speaker 1: So one of the highlighted sections.

283
00:17:14,632 --> 00:17:16,329
Speaker 1: This is exactly what we're talking about.

284
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:32,442
Speaker 1: So Veneza, one of the characters chuckles and says it says, but then you meet someone fine at the neighborhood block party or you go out for Vietnamese pierogies or some other bizarre shit you can't get anywhere but in this dumb ass city.

285
00:17:32,804 --> 00:17:42,770
Speaker 1: or you go see an off off off Broadway Fringe Festival play nobody else has seen or you have a random encounter on the subway that becomes something so special and beautiful that you tell your grandkids about it someday.

286
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,569
Speaker 1: It's like that's New York.

287
00:17:44,901 --> 00:17:45,090
Speaker 1: Right.

288
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:56,849
Speaker 1: That's why you pay ten times the rent to live here than in somewhere else where there's nothing to do and you'll never experience anything special other than go to work, come home, watch TV, go to bed.

289
00:17:57,237 --> 00:17:57,509
Speaker 1: Right.

290
00:17:58,011 --> 00:17:59,130
Speaker 1: It's all that shit is real.

291
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,649
Speaker 1: That is what it is like to live in New York.

292
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:02,530
Speaker 1: Right.

293
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:06,230
Speaker 1: And this book is just things like that was not even a full paragraph.

294
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:17,769
Speaker 0: You're going to find this really funny because the paragraph I highlighted, I felt that to my bones because the paragraph before it is her talking about how much New York City sucks shit, which is also true.

295
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,429
Speaker 1: And yes, it's also true.

296
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:25,890
Speaker 0: But there's the line where, yeah, well, you New Yorkers, every step, the new ones always say that it's dirty.

297
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:26,810
Speaker 0: There's too many cars.

298
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,189
Speaker 0: Nothing's maintained the way it should be.

299
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,149
Speaker 0: It's too hot in the summer to go to the winner.

300
00:18:30,731 --> 00:18:32,988
Speaker 0: It sinks like unwashed ass most of the time.

301
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,669
Speaker 0: But you ever notice how none of you ever fucking leave?

302
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:36,829
Speaker 1: That's right.

303
00:18:37,772 --> 00:18:38,590
Speaker 1: That's fucking right.

304
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,550
Speaker 1: Because leaving means bumble fuck where nothing ever happens.

305
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,375
Speaker 1: And you don't you can't?

306
00:18:43,577 --> 00:18:45,030
Speaker 1: you want to eat Vietnamese pierogies.

307
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:45,829
Speaker 1: They don't have those.

308
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:51,730
Speaker 1: Like when I see an off off Broadway Fringe play, you can't even see a Broadway play in some, you know, some bumble town.

309
00:18:51,857 --> 00:18:52,070
Speaker 1: Right.

310
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:55,190
Speaker 1: Oh, you want to have a, you know, meet someone at the neighborhood block party.

311
00:18:55,482 --> 00:18:55,630
Speaker 1: Yeah.

312
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,543
Speaker 1: You'll meet the 10 people you already know because those are the only people who live there.

313
00:18:58,777 --> 00:18:58,950
Speaker 1: Yeah.

314
00:18:59,131 --> 00:19:01,470
Speaker 0: It's like living up in like it was a fun place.

315
00:19:01,571 --> 00:19:07,368
Speaker 0: But yeah, we would choose every time we wanted to go out for dinner, like you, me and Emily and Alex, which of the eight restaurants to go to.

316
00:19:08,294 --> 00:19:08,849
Speaker 1: Yep, exactly.

317
00:19:09,255 --> 00:19:10,310
Speaker 0: We want to drive somewhere.

318
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:15,747
Speaker 1: So we could spend the whole time talking about how great New York is and how bad every other place is.

319
00:19:15,911 --> 00:19:17,530
Speaker 1: But we do that every day on Geek Nights.

320
00:19:18,232 --> 00:19:19,340
Speaker 1: So let's talk about the book instead.

321
00:19:22,012 --> 00:19:23,789
Speaker 1: The non-New York parts of the book.

322
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:24,202
Speaker 1: Yep.

323
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:29,050
Speaker 0: So I guess a little of the characters first, because I got a lot to say about every one of these characters.

324
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:34,910
Speaker 1: Well, so all the characters are all, you know, there's the New York character who's only in the prologue, basically.

325
00:19:35,371 --> 00:19:35,990
Speaker 0: And the epilogue.

326
00:19:36,716 --> 00:19:37,150
Speaker 1: And the epilogue.

327
00:19:37,191 --> 00:19:38,487
Speaker 1: Basically becomes a MacGuffin.

328
00:19:39,532 --> 00:19:41,350
Speaker 1: It's throughout the main part of the book.

329
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:45,930
Speaker 1: The New York character is a MacGuffin because they're trying to find, right, the borrow characters.

330
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,970
Speaker 0: Wikipedia describes the primary so well.

331
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:49,848
Speaker 0: I'm just going to read this.

332
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,969
Speaker 0: A queer, black, homeless young man, an artist and a hustler.

333
00:19:54,756 --> 00:19:55,350
Speaker 1: That's New York.

334
00:19:55,792 --> 00:19:56,689
Speaker 1: Is that not New York?

335
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:57,830
Speaker 1: That's right.

336
00:19:58,151 --> 00:20:01,209
Speaker 1: If you magically turn New York into a person, that's what they would be.

337
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:05,549
Speaker 1: But OK, so the borrows are just as apt.

338
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:06,058
Speaker 0: Yep.

339
00:20:06,436 --> 00:20:06,990
Speaker 0: Like Manhattan.

340
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:12,207
Speaker 0: The dude literally forgets who he was and becomes a different person after he lives here even a little bit.

341
00:20:13,571 --> 00:20:19,890
Speaker 1: And which is which is an allegory for, you know, the the, you know, Manhattan, which was conquered, basically.

342
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:20,182
Speaker 1: Yeah.

343
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:20,477
Speaker 1: Right.

344
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,829
Speaker 1: You know, the Lenapes were kicked out.

345
00:20:23,318 --> 00:20:23,610
Speaker 1: Right.

346
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:30,190
Speaker 1: You know, there was a. what's the name of the the the the little village of black people in Central Park that was blown away.

347
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:30,503
Speaker 1: Right.

348
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,370
Speaker 1: It's all it's allegories for all of that.

349
00:20:32,451 --> 00:20:32,706
Speaker 1: Right.

350
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:49,370
Speaker 0: And never mind the fact that like that he's portrayed as becoming indescribable in race, like no one can quite pin on where he's from because he's from everywhere, because so many different types of people are represented by the history of Manhattan specifically and just live there.

351
00:20:49,851 --> 00:20:55,190
Speaker 0: Like a lot of people think of Manhattan as being just midtown, but like go to southern Manhattan or go up to Harlem or go up to Inwood.

352
00:20:55,552 --> 00:20:57,270
Speaker 0: They are radically different neighborhoods.

353
00:20:59,793 --> 00:21:06,230
Speaker 1: But also, it's like I like the fact, especially with Seneca Village, that was the one it was destroyed in 1825.

354
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:16,110
Speaker 0: The book and Manhattan is a good character to reference to show that does not like gloss over the horrific things that New York or Manhattan has done to people.

355
00:21:16,531 --> 00:21:18,983
Speaker 1: And it's like it's like Manhattan has this like right.

356
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:24,629
Speaker 1: They know that they have this dangerous past and that they can't really remember it.

357
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,770
Speaker 1: It's like I was evil, but I've forgotten it.

358
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:27,970
Speaker 1: Right.

359
00:21:28,011 --> 00:21:28,830
Speaker 1: Just like Manhattan.

360
00:21:28,951 --> 00:21:32,910
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, so much evil was done to form Manhattan.

361
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,407
Speaker 1: And it's you don't think about it when you're right.

362
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,490
Speaker 1: But also, there is still capable of that.

363
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:42,630
Speaker 0: Like Manhattan will still just kill you like Manhattan, destroy lives.

364
00:21:42,871 --> 00:21:45,149
Speaker 0: Manhattan is where Wall Street exists, like Manhattan.

365
00:21:45,593 --> 00:21:47,530
Speaker 1: You just get hit by a car walking on the sidewalk.

366
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,829
Speaker 0: Manhattan is dangerous and can fuck you up.

367
00:21:50,292 --> 00:21:51,600
Speaker 0: And it's trying to like.

368
00:21:51,661 --> 00:21:53,130
Speaker 0: it's mostly doing the right thing.

369
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,649
Speaker 0: And it plays an important role in the city.

370
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,490
Speaker 0: But I love there's one line I highlighted.

371
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:01,270
Speaker 0: I'm not going to go and keep reading quotes or we're just going to go down that path forever.

372
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:06,789
Speaker 0: But there's a line where he's talking about the city and they're talking and they're all trying to figure out their powers.

373
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:15,090
Speaker 0: And they all realize that Manhattan's main power derives from the fact that it needs people to recognize its greatness.

374
00:22:15,571 --> 00:22:27,010
Speaker 0: Anything that happens in Manhattan, there's this undercurrent of the people who did it wanna other people to recognize it and respect it and look and point at it from a distance.

375
00:22:27,091 --> 00:22:30,090
Speaker 0: They want that recognition and that respect.

376
00:22:30,231 --> 00:22:32,410
Speaker 0: And it's an interesting double edged sword.

377
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:36,210
Speaker 1: It's also interesting that Manhattan, you know, a lot of the other characters, right?

378
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:37,869
Speaker 1: Brooklyn is a person who lives in Brooklyn.

379
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,250
Speaker 1: Queens is a person who lives in Queens.

380
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,730
Speaker 1: Bronx is a person who lives in the Bronx.

381
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:44,369
Speaker 1: Manhattan is someone who arrives in Penn Station on a train, right?

382
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,842
Speaker 1: Representing the tourist aspect of like.

383
00:22:46,882 --> 00:22:47,930
Speaker 1: that's what the tourists are.

384
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:54,169
Speaker 0: But also recommending representing the tech bro who moves to New York because he finally got the good job.

385
00:22:54,613 --> 00:22:57,370
Speaker 0: It represents the business people, the Wall Street nonsense.

386
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:04,596
Speaker 0: But also what I thought was interesting is Manhattan becomes the direct bodyguard of the city itself.

387
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:15,430
Speaker 0: because one thing that Manhattan does, and I think this allegory is woven in very well, the money that Manhattan brings in is a big part, despite the fact that we only tap into maybe point one percent of that money.

388
00:23:16,132 --> 00:23:18,970
Speaker 0: That's the only reason New York could even exist in the form that it does.

389
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:24,949
Speaker 0: Manhattan is the reason New York is able to be what it is, because that brings in this money.

390
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:31,289
Speaker 0: Granted, we need to tap into more of that money, but Manhattan sort of gives the rest of the city cover to continue to exist.

391
00:23:32,331 --> 00:23:35,729
Speaker 0: Hopefully Wall Street doesn't completely destroy that, which is kind of what the plot of the book was.

392
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,990
Speaker 0: But I digress.

393
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:42,550
Speaker 1: All right, so the next character is Brooklyn, right?

394
00:23:43,334 --> 00:23:45,010
Speaker 1: In terms of book introduction order.

395
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:48,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, because Brooklyn saves Manhattan pretty early on, which is pretty apt as well.

396
00:23:49,692 --> 00:23:52,228
Speaker 0: Brooklyn saves Manhattan from its incompetence and naivety.

397
00:23:53,210 --> 00:24:00,849
Speaker 0: But she I think she's my as much as I like Queens, Queens doesn't get enough lines and enough screen time.

398
00:24:01,374 --> 00:24:03,169
Speaker 0: I think Brooklyn is actually my favorite character.

399
00:24:04,775 --> 00:24:06,250
Speaker 1: I kind of like the Bronx anyway.

400
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:21,347
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know, so Brooklyn is a city councilwoman, but used to be a former rapper, former hip hop artist, lawyer, right, whose family owns some brownstones, you know, from back in the day.

401
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

402
00:24:23,031 --> 00:24:28,110
Speaker 1: And, you know, she's a total, you know, don't take no, she doesn't take shit from anybody.

403
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,509
Speaker 0: The only person who takes less shit than her is Branca.

404
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:32,381
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

405
00:24:36,151 --> 00:24:37,878
Speaker 1: So, yeah, you know, it's like.

406
00:24:37,898 --> 00:24:41,010
Speaker 1: I think I think the thing is she's introduced, right?

407
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:44,350
Speaker 1: And she sort of like saves, you know, she saves Manhattan right away.

408
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:55,310
Speaker 1: But after that, she's just sort of like, you know, like there's no conflicts that directly involve her biz until right later on.

409
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:56,570
Speaker 0: Well, she does, though.

410
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,630
Speaker 0: She does protect her own borough first.

411
00:24:59,576 --> 00:25:00,150
Speaker 1: Right, exactly.

412
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,983
Speaker 1: But there's this sort of, you know, this is a lot of.

413
00:25:03,023 --> 00:25:06,370
Speaker 1: the book is sort of like this the this gathering of the boroughs, right?

414
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:10,490
Speaker 1: They're trying to get together once they realize what the hell's going on, because none of them know anything, right?

415
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:13,463
Speaker 1: They just suddenly their cities, their boroughs.

416
00:25:13,523 --> 00:25:15,729
Speaker 1: now, they were just people, you know, five minutes ago.

417
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:21,007
Speaker 0: But the fact that she is very much in Broncos like this to like, I don't have time for this shit.

418
00:25:21,211 --> 00:25:24,850
Speaker 0: Like that's their first thought is such a New York thought.

419
00:25:28,112 --> 00:25:38,830
Speaker 0: But also, like I like her history of like rapper who was also part of a very complex, problematic and important rap culture.

420
00:25:39,313 --> 00:25:42,050
Speaker 0: And the book addresses that directly and she addresses that directly.

421
00:25:42,491 --> 00:25:53,957
Speaker 0: And I like there's a big fight between her and Bronco near the end that really, really stood out as pointed, because on one hand, Brooklyn has to not like can't wave off the fact that there's there.

422
00:25:54,138 --> 00:25:56,350
Speaker 0: Brooklyn's not perfect and that culture is not perfect.

423
00:25:56,751 --> 00:26:03,549
Speaker 0: But also, the Bronx has to recognize that I'm going after Brooklyn because this is whoever's closest to me right now.

424
00:26:03,652 --> 00:26:04,410
Speaker 0: Like, it's not right.

425
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:08,670
Speaker 0: We're allies, but I'm going to go after whoever is closest to me right now.

426
00:26:08,771 --> 00:26:09,928
Speaker 0: Because that's who I can punch first.

427
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:13,548
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, that's how, you know, again, that's how New York is.

428
00:26:13,895 --> 00:26:14,090
Speaker 1: Right.

429
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:18,190
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, if the rest of the world was all, you know, eliminated.

430
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:18,604
Speaker 1: Right.

431
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:19,447
Speaker 1: It's like New York.

432
00:26:19,951 --> 00:26:20,740
Speaker 0: Our knives conflict within.

433
00:26:21,876 --> 00:26:22,169
Speaker 1: Yeah.

434
00:26:22,411 --> 00:26:29,990
Speaker 0: I mean, the Bronx is the ignored forgotten district, like borough of the city to most New Yorkers other than Staten Island, which is rightly ignored and forgotten.

435
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,990
Speaker 1: But all right.

436
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:32,590
Speaker 1: So that right.

437
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:33,102
Speaker 1: So you get the.

438
00:26:33,691 --> 00:26:38,790
Speaker 1: Branca, right, was, you know, obviously represents the Bronx name like Branca.

439
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:43,710
Speaker 0: But Bronx, I love how it has the history of long before New York.

440
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,509
Speaker 0: It's the oldest settlements.

441
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:46,448
Speaker 1: Yep.

442
00:26:46,835 --> 00:26:47,870
Speaker 1: And, you know, of course.

443
00:26:48,018 --> 00:26:48,190
Speaker 1: Right.

444
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,687
Speaker 1: She like runs, you know, an art.

445
00:26:50,573 --> 00:26:52,890
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's like, is it a museum or like an art?

446
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:53,409
Speaker 1: It's a gallery.

447
00:26:53,770 --> 00:27:05,530
Speaker 0: It's like it's like a city funded and philanthropist funded gallery that showcases like non white art and non straight art and struggles to get local.

448
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,850
Speaker 1: Local artists are living there, working there.

449
00:27:08,931 --> 00:27:09,038
Speaker 1: Right.

450
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:12,829
Speaker 1: They got studios in there, you know, display places in there.

451
00:27:12,994 --> 00:27:13,249
Speaker 1: Right.

452
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:15,350
Speaker 1: And Branca runs that shit.

453
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:15,476
Speaker 1: Yeah.

454
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:19,530
Speaker 0: And she's in her sixties and she'll she'll fuck you up.

455
00:27:19,751 --> 00:27:21,528
Speaker 0: I mean, she fucks up Mrs.

456
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,588
Speaker 0: White pretty early on before she really realizes what she is.

457
00:27:25,325 --> 00:27:25,470
Speaker 1: Right.

458
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:29,310
Speaker 1: Well, she's also got, you know, but the thing is, Branca also is like the most experience.

459
00:27:29,591 --> 00:27:33,430
Speaker 1: I think, you know, Branca sort of became a borough, I think, before other people.

460
00:27:33,531 --> 00:27:35,710
Speaker 1: It has like more experience with like the city power.

461
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:44,166
Speaker 0: Well, it's more that she was more in tune with what her boroughs really like, which is compounded by the fact that a lot of New Yorkers don't really know what the Bronx is like.

462
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:49,030
Speaker 0: The Bronx, it has like physical, very diverse.

463
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:59,550
Speaker 1: And it also, you know, I think also the Bronx different from other boroughs, at least on purpose, cut off from the rest of the city by Robert Moses.

464
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:01,526
Speaker 1: That's one thing.

465
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,030
Speaker 0: And the book addresses that.

466
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:08,049
Speaker 0: I like how they treat those heat freeways as like wounds in the Bronx that were never fully healed.

467
00:28:09,072 --> 00:28:09,904
Speaker 1: But also, right.

468
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:13,250
Speaker 1: In terms of it's like a lot of the other boroughs, right.

469
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:14,910
Speaker 1: You know, Manhattan, for example.

470
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,230
Speaker 1: Right.

471
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:19,970
Speaker 1: It's like all the evilness of Manhattan is like in, you know, centuries ago.

472
00:28:20,093 --> 00:28:20,385
Speaker 1: Right.

473
00:28:20,592 --> 00:28:21,450
Speaker 1: You know, it's like, yeah.

474
00:28:21,651 --> 00:28:36,430
Speaker 1: You know, whereas in the Bronx, it's like if you were in the Bronx in like 1950, 1960, even maybe 1970 something, it's like it was sort of like a suburban kind of place, depending on the neighborhood.

475
00:28:36,818 --> 00:28:37,089
Speaker 1: Right.

476
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:41,690
Speaker 1: You know, you had like affluent white people and like, you know, homes, driveways.

477
00:28:41,911 --> 00:28:45,110
Speaker 1: And, you know, it might not even you might be like, that's the Bronx.

478
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:45,631
Speaker 1: It's like.

479
00:28:46,213 --> 00:28:53,809
Speaker 1: it's like, yeah, a significant part of the Bronx looked like that at, you know, not too long ago, but that's all gone now.

480
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:59,250
Speaker 0: But also the Bronx has been largely on its own historically in that it's not funded enough.

481
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,447
Speaker 0: It's not invested in compared to the other boroughs.

482
00:29:02,192 --> 00:29:05,128
Speaker 0: The other boroughs basically ignore it unless they have to pay attention to it.

483
00:29:06,652 --> 00:29:13,528
Speaker 1: The mayor probably goes to the Bronx less than any other, you know, no matter which mayor it is, which party they're from.

484
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:15,870
Speaker 1: The Bronx is the least attention.

485
00:29:16,251 --> 00:29:21,090
Speaker 0: So a lot of like current day neighborhoods in the Bronx have to be extremely self-reliant.

486
00:29:23,601 --> 00:29:23,990
Speaker 0: But anyway.

487
00:29:25,113 --> 00:29:27,490
Speaker 0: We got Queens, who is just delightful.

488
00:29:29,174 --> 00:29:30,689
Speaker 1: Queens is extremely Queens.

489
00:29:32,733 --> 00:29:33,147
Speaker 0: She's new.

490
00:29:33,831 --> 00:29:34,909
Speaker 0: She like new to the city.

491
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:36,032
Speaker 0: Yep.

492
00:29:36,132 --> 00:29:38,210
Speaker 0: A nerd has a job.

493
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,070
Speaker 1: Queens representing the immigrants.

494
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:45,310
Speaker 1: Queens, the most diverse, you know, place in the entire country's world, maybe.

495
00:29:45,952 --> 00:29:50,770
Speaker 0: Queens is absolutely the most diverse geographic space in America.

496
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,510
Speaker 0: I don't know about the world, but definitely America.

497
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,649
Speaker 0: I've seen multiple papers talk about that.

498
00:29:55,870 --> 00:30:05,250
Speaker 0: And Queens is also a representation, but it's diverse in not just in races, diverse in cultures, diverse in ideas, diverse in neighborhoods, diverse in languages.

499
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,514
Speaker 1: Language is like the number of.

500
00:30:06,977 --> 00:30:12,330
Speaker 1: I think I was at the Queens Museum and they were like, yeah, there's like over like some hundred something languages.

501
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:17,692
Speaker 0: I saw stats that I'm not going to try to Google now, but it was something to the effect of the.

502
00:30:18,154 --> 00:30:24,429
Speaker 0: the Queens in New York City has the highest density of actively spoken languages of any place on earth.

503
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:29,790
Speaker 1: According to 138 languages are spoken in Queens.

504
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,549
Speaker 1: Diversity capital of the world.

505
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:33,349
Speaker 1: Yeah.

506
00:30:33,691 --> 00:30:35,222
Speaker 1: According to babel.com.

507
00:30:36,671 --> 00:30:40,210
Speaker 0: But also language site like look what Queens is as a character.

508
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:47,889
Speaker 0: There are a lot of people who are highly skilled doctors, technology professionals from all over the world who come to New York.

509
00:30:48,411 --> 00:30:49,750
Speaker 0: Queens is where they get their start.

510
00:30:50,191 --> 00:30:57,070
Speaker 0: And they usually end up working for a relatively unethical company that they hate, because that's where all the money and jobs are for people who are that skilled.

511
00:30:57,552 --> 00:30:59,970
Speaker 1: There was even a mention of Rims Neighborhood in this book.

512
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:02,586
Speaker 0: Yeah, full of tech bros, people like me.

513
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:04,669
Speaker 0: I came to New York.

514
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:08,130
Speaker 0: I went straight to Queens and I worked for a relatively unethical company.

515
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:12,069
Speaker 1: In a neighborhood that was called out for having people like rim in it.

516
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:14,589
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a bad part.

517
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,684
Speaker 1: The one part of Queens.

518
00:31:16,704 --> 00:31:17,310
Speaker 1: that's not true.

519
00:31:17,632 --> 00:31:18,148
Speaker 1: It's not good.

520
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:21,089
Speaker 0: This part of Queens is rapidly becoming Manhattan, too.

521
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:36,670
Speaker 1: The thing I the thing about Queens is that, you know, not only is the characters spot on, but the scene that really, you know, that house, that house, they all live in, that apartment building, the house, they all the place Queens lives in the apartment building.

522
00:31:36,771 --> 00:31:38,930
Speaker 1: And there's a scene where someone goes up the stairs.

523
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:39,890
Speaker 0: Oh, that's that's the scene.

524
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:46,329
Speaker 1: I was thinking of every sees all the people, the different people who live in the different apartments in the building and what they're up to.

525
00:31:46,511 --> 00:31:49,730
Speaker 1: And it's like, it's like they took all of Queens, right?

526
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:58,949
Speaker 1: Every kind of person that you could possibly put it in somehow fit them into one building and then describe them all on just a few pages, right?

527
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:04,408
Speaker 1: It's like, I was like, I was in that apartment building and I'm like, I've been in that apartment building forever.

528
00:32:04,772 --> 00:32:06,490
Speaker 1: You know, it's not even a real building.

529
00:32:07,612 --> 00:32:10,209
Speaker 1: But, you know, I've been in buildings just like that.

530
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:10,567
Speaker 1: Right.

531
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:10,839
Speaker 1: Yeah.

532
00:32:11,352 --> 00:32:16,748
Speaker 1: And it's like even in my building, which is not exactly like that building, it's newer and fancier.

533
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,210
Speaker 1: Right.

534
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:28,830
Speaker 1: But it still has, you know, a good chunk of that feeling in it, despite being, you know, in a different part of Queens, you know, with more monies and whatnot.

535
00:32:28,935 --> 00:32:29,065
Speaker 1: Yeah.

536
00:32:29,511 --> 00:32:33,130
Speaker 0: So then we got Staten Island, who, well, is horrible.

537
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:38,090
Speaker 0: But I got to say this, what a spot on well-written character.

538
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:38,810
Speaker 1: Well, this is right.

539
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:39,630
Speaker 1: She's the major.

540
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:43,330
Speaker 0: So close to figuring it out.

541
00:32:43,891 --> 00:32:55,785
Speaker 0: But the thing is, Staten Island in the real world gets so close to figuring out and then reliably votes for Nazis, destroys itself like it is politically a horrible and dangerous place.

542
00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:00,650
Speaker 1: And there are parts of Staten Island near the north part that aren't that way.

543
00:33:00,811 --> 00:33:04,910
Speaker 1: But pretty much once you go past the north part, it's like it's suddenly, you know, to the car area.

544
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:21,570
Speaker 0: But she is like the stereotypical white girl who's been sheltered by racist parents in a fucked up marriage, who is afraid to even leave home and has never actually taken the ferry to the city and hates it because everyone around her hates it and is afraid of everyone.

545
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:28,329
Speaker 0: I mean, she almost kills Sao Paulo within 30 seconds of meeting him because she realizes he's a brown man.

546
00:33:29,151 --> 00:33:38,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, there is, you know, but even the Staten Island, right, there's sort of like this glimmer of like, you know, maybe right, you know, she'll come around.

547
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:41,229
Speaker 0: Oh, and if this book was written by anyone other than N.K.

548
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:44,490
Speaker 0: Jemisin, my fear was they would have had her come around.

549
00:33:44,811 --> 00:33:48,130
Speaker 0: The fact that this book did not have her come around, I think it was very poignant.

550
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:52,050
Speaker 1: Well, because it's showing you the reality is that, like, yes, there are people in Staten Island.

551
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:56,707
Speaker 1: I've had coworkers like, you know, they're not bad Staten Island people, even though they live there.

552
00:33:57,042 --> 00:33:57,210
Speaker 1: Right.

553
00:33:57,331 --> 00:33:59,110
Speaker 1: But it's like they live in Staten Island.

554
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:03,070
Speaker 1: They, you know, they commute, get on the little ferry every day, come to Manhattan, work.

555
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:04,487
Speaker 0: I used to work downtown.

556
00:34:04,771 --> 00:34:07,490
Speaker 0: There's a one bus stop right outside my office when I worked down there.

557
00:34:07,591 --> 00:34:10,570
Speaker 0: That was one of the main buses that goes back to a neighborhood in Staten Island.

558
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:15,743
Speaker 0: And people would be lined up all the way down the block to take the commuter bus home every day.

559
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,409
Speaker 0: One hundred percent of those people were white.

560
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:19,830
Speaker 1: Well, sure.

561
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:30,129
Speaker 1: But, you know, there are like some people in Staten Island, some percentage of them that are sort of representing that hope that, you know, Staten Island is at least in part New York.

562
00:34:30,417 --> 00:34:30,570
Speaker 1: Right.

563
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:36,049
Speaker 1: It's like there is some amount of New Yorkness via the conduit of that ferry that is in the Verrazano.

564
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:44,810
Speaker 0: I guess the beginning of the book to the beginning of the book makes a very optimistic picture when she's sort of like feeling herself as Staten Island and exploring the island.

565
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:51,449
Speaker 0: And it does make a point about how Staten Island is a less New York blue collar place.

566
00:34:51,831 --> 00:35:07,750
Speaker 0: But it comes into New York to do the jobs that won't pay anyone else to do because those people can only afford to live in Staten Island, but they can only afford to live there because they're usually middle class ish families who are white, who have land from the 50s, and they just still live in those houses.

567
00:35:08,191 --> 00:35:11,810
Speaker 0: Like it's unearned middle class, third generation wealth.

568
00:35:12,691 --> 00:35:17,929
Speaker 0: And it makes this point about how like these are a different type of person who are part of the fabric of New York.

569
00:35:18,211 --> 00:35:26,169
Speaker 0: A ton of Staten Islanders work in Manhattan and how New York turns his back on them, disrespects them, like ignores them.

570
00:35:27,733 --> 00:35:34,306
Speaker 0: And it starts to make a point that maybe if we embrace them more, they would come around a little bit.

571
00:35:34,671 --> 00:35:38,629
Speaker 0: But the book categorically argues in the end that they'll fuck us over every time.

572
00:35:39,372 --> 00:35:41,610
Speaker 1: Well, the current state of things, right?

573
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:46,730
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, I wonder, right, is, you know, it's like, I don't think the book will become dated.

574
00:35:46,971 --> 00:35:51,530
Speaker 1: You know, it's like, you know, it'll just be it'll just be set in this time.

575
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:51,870
Speaker 1: Right.

576
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:56,088
Speaker 1: If someone reads this book 50 or 100 years from now, they'll look at it the same way we look.

577
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:56,976
Speaker 1: You know, I was just comment.

578
00:35:56,996 --> 00:35:57,863
Speaker 0: Trump got 30th century.

579
00:35:59,912 --> 00:36:04,074
Speaker 0: Trump got 33 percent more votes in Staten Island in 2020 than he got in 2016.

580
00:36:04,074 --> 00:36:05,729
Speaker 0: It is getting worse, not better there.

581
00:36:06,562 --> 00:36:06,709
Speaker 1: Right.

582
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:13,011
Speaker 1: It's you know, it's percentage wise, it's not great, but there is still a fraction of it.

583
00:36:13,091 --> 00:36:16,190
Speaker 1: that is, you know, New York right on the north side.

584
00:36:16,391 --> 00:36:34,010
Speaker 0: It bleeds anyway, but just the book portrays her so perfectly, especially that scene where her dad, the like directly corrupt, evil cop who clearly beats his wife, tries to hook her up with the literal Proud Boy Nazi with the swastika tattoo.

585
00:36:34,878 --> 00:36:35,068
Speaker 1: Yep.

586
00:36:36,772 --> 00:36:50,430
Speaker 0: That guy was definitely a Richard Spencer like stand in type to a T. But her inner monologue is fascinating the way it's written, because like you're reading the description of that Nazi guy and I'm reading it.

587
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:56,608
Speaker 0: I'm thinking I imagine the Proud Boy wearing the suspenders and the erotic mustache with the Nazi hair.

588
00:36:57,152 --> 00:37:00,650
Speaker 0: But the way she sees him as he looks like a gay guy.

589
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:03,229
Speaker 0: Why is my dad hanging out with a gay guy?

590
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:07,745
Speaker 0: Like she doesn't even recognize the fact that 1488 is a Nazi tattoo.

591
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:10,042
Speaker 1: Yep.

592
00:37:10,654 --> 00:37:11,358
Speaker 0: It has to be.

593
00:37:11,378 --> 00:37:13,008
Speaker 1: a lot of people don't.

594
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:16,189
Speaker 0: They don't, but especially the Staten Island sheltered girl.

595
00:37:18,773 --> 00:37:21,350
Speaker 0: And she's so close to taking the ferry to the city.

596
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:26,629
Speaker 0: But every time, given the choice between trusting a non-white person and trusting Mrs.

597
00:37:26,689 --> 00:37:28,085
Speaker 0: White, she trusts Mrs.

598
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:28,370
Speaker 0: White.

599
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:30,387
Speaker 0: And in the end, she is Mrs.

600
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:30,630
Speaker 0: White.

601
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:31,248
Speaker 0: Fuck her.

602
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:35,670
Speaker 1: So there's one more character, which is Vazina, right?

603
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:38,050
Speaker 1: Who isn't from New York, right?

604
00:37:38,212 --> 00:37:39,188
Speaker 0: Transpose the N and the Z.

605
00:37:40,971 --> 00:37:43,366
Speaker 1: It's hard not to because there's a Vazina trophy.

606
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:47,450
Speaker 0: Half black, half Portuguese, works in the Bronx, lives in Jersey City.

607
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:48,890
Speaker 0: I got it literally.

608
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:55,184
Speaker 0: As soon as I knew she was from Jersey City, I assumed she was going to be the actual Fifth Borough.

609
00:37:56,557 --> 00:37:57,510
Speaker 0: I called it immediately.

610
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:58,160
Speaker 0: I was 100% sure.

611
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,010
Speaker 1: Easy call, right?

612
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:04,690
Speaker 0: Because in the real world, Jersey City, like we make fun of Jersey City because fuck Jersey.

613
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:12,870
Speaker 0: But New Jersey City is so much more tightly coupled to and part of the fabric of New York City than Staten Island.

614
00:38:13,352 --> 00:38:16,450
Speaker 0: It's ludicrous that Staten Island is even part of New York City politically.

615
00:38:17,675 --> 00:38:19,210
Speaker 1: So for people who don't live here, right?

616
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:30,610
Speaker 1: So to go to Staten Island from New York City, Manhattan or Brooklyn, you need to either use a ferry, which is free, or you can drive over the Verrazano Bridge, which is long.

617
00:38:31,331 --> 00:38:33,470
Speaker 0: Or you can take a bus that uses that same bridge.

618
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,089
Speaker 0: It takes forever.

619
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:37,530
Speaker 1: And if you reach Staten Island, do you know what's over there?

620
00:38:37,752 --> 00:38:39,230
Speaker 1: It's just like houses.

621
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,710
Speaker 1: Like there's nothing tall there.

622
00:38:40,771 --> 00:38:41,930
Speaker 1: It doesn't feel like a city.

623
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:43,670
Speaker 1: It feels like a suburb place.

624
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:44,670
Speaker 1: There's literal farms.

625
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,948
Speaker 1: Strip malls, you know.

626
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,670
Speaker 0: Houses with yards everywhere.

627
00:38:49,712 --> 00:38:49,802
Speaker 1: Yeah.

628
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,550
Speaker 1: Pools, swimming pools, right?

629
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:52,408
Speaker 0: Just empty land.

630
00:38:52,852 --> 00:38:53,710
Speaker 1: Just tons of empty land.

631
00:38:54,493 --> 00:38:55,470
Speaker 1: It doesn't feel like a city.

632
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:57,090
Speaker 1: Well, there's some nice parks, actually.

633
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:58,250
Speaker 1: You can like, anyway.

634
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:00,210
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, well, I got my vaccine there.

635
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:03,290
Speaker 0: So we took our bikes there and biked around the entire island.

636
00:39:04,233 --> 00:39:05,288
Speaker 1: Anyway, so.

637
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,310
Speaker 1: But if you go to Jersey City, right?

638
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:20,850
Speaker 1: So to get to Jersey City, you can go through like the Lincoln Tunnel, or you can just use George Washington Bridge or the Holland Tunnel, or you can use an Amtrak or a New Jersey transit train, or you can use a path train.

639
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:24,490
Speaker 1: It's like there are a lot of ways to get to North Jersey.

640
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,530
Speaker 1: A bus, buses, tons of them, right?

641
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:27,690
Speaker 1: You can't take a bus to Staten Island.

642
00:39:28,213 --> 00:39:29,630
Speaker 1: I guess you can over the Verrazano.

643
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:33,110
Speaker 1: But anyway, there's a lot of ways to get over to North Jersey.

644
00:39:33,232 --> 00:39:34,350
Speaker 1: Jersey City specifically.

645
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:42,590
Speaker 1: And if you go over there, you know, Hoboken also, I guess, you know, kinda it's like all that area over there at the very north of Jersey.

646
00:39:43,451 --> 00:39:47,110
Speaker 1: It it, you know, it doesn't feel like the rest of New Jersey.

647
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:51,130
Speaker 1: Like there are tall office buildings over there like skyscraper ones.

648
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:56,570
Speaker 0: Dude, that North Jersey is a more dense real city than most cities in America are.

649
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:57,890
Speaker 1: There's a lot of people there.

650
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,090
Speaker 1: They're actually like little.

651
00:39:59,270 --> 00:39:59,689
Speaker 1: They're not really.

652
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:02,170
Speaker 1: I guess they're technically ferries, but like water taxis.

653
00:40:02,271 --> 00:40:06,030
Speaker 1: Like a lot of people will live like on the water in North Jersey.

654
00:40:06,492 --> 00:40:16,590
Speaker 1: And I guess when they were still commuting as a thing pre pandemic, people would take a little water taxi over to Manhattan and back right to get to work just because it's cheaper to live over there.

655
00:40:16,677 --> 00:40:16,810
Speaker 1: Right.

656
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,330
Speaker 1: You're a Jersey resident technically.

657
00:40:18,371 --> 00:40:18,669
Speaker 1: Right.

658
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:19,990
Speaker 1: You vote for Jersey governor.

659
00:40:20,071 --> 00:40:22,010
Speaker 1: You know, you don't get to vote for New York mayor.

660
00:40:22,451 --> 00:40:29,990
Speaker 1: But those people who live there right are more like, you know, the New Yorkers, right?

661
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:33,426
Speaker 1: Then people from Staten Island are culturally speaking like they're.

662
00:40:33,446 --> 00:40:37,510
Speaker 0: they're less connected because they go home at the end of the day, like they don't stay out in the city.

663
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:46,530
Speaker 1: I mean, someone from Queens taking the seven train to Manhattan to their job versus someone living in Jersey City taking a pen train, a path train.

664
00:40:46,912 --> 00:40:51,070
Speaker 1: It's like those are more culturally similar than someone who lives in Staten Island.

665
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:51,297
Speaker 0: Yep.

666
00:40:52,111 --> 00:40:56,590
Speaker 0: I mean, in a just world, that would just be the sixth borough and Yonkers would be the seventh borough.

667
00:40:56,751 --> 00:40:59,649
Speaker 0: And then we go back to six because Staten Island has nothing to do with New York.

668
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:01,030
Speaker 1: Yeah.

669
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:03,630
Speaker 1: So the book officially, you know, I guess spoilers, right?

670
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:06,289
Speaker 0: Officially recognizes that there's a great line.

671
00:41:06,671 --> 00:41:08,150
Speaker 0: I think Branka figures it out.

672
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:08,869
Speaker 0: She's like, wait a minute.

673
00:41:09,831 --> 00:41:13,370
Speaker 0: Cities don't follow politics and geographic made up nonsense.

674
00:41:13,431 --> 00:41:14,330
Speaker 0: That's where the city is.

675
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:14,845
Speaker 0: It's right there.

676
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:16,550
Speaker 1: Yep, exactly.

677
00:41:17,998 --> 00:41:18,468
Speaker 1: So there's that.

678
00:41:18,859 --> 00:41:19,049
Speaker 1: Right.

679
00:41:19,491 --> 00:41:22,706
Speaker 1: OK, so now the primary conflict of this book, because really there are.

680
00:41:22,726 --> 00:41:24,290
Speaker 0: there are a couple more characters.

681
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:26,348
Speaker 0: Sao Paulo figures in pretty heavily.

682
00:41:26,933 --> 00:41:28,349
Speaker 1: And Hong Kong is there a little bit.

683
00:41:28,493 --> 00:41:28,621
Speaker 1: Yeah.

684
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:30,389
Speaker 0: Hong Kong's real funny.

685
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:45,329
Speaker 0: I think I laughed out loud at a few of his lines more than anything, but Sao Paulo was real fun and they used him a lot and he felt pretty true to my very, very.

686
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:46,510
Speaker 0: I've only been to Sao Paulo twice.

687
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:50,428
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't I don't know anything about Sao Paulo other than, you know, where it is on the map.

688
00:41:50,990 --> 00:42:03,690
Speaker 0: And I've been there a couple of times, but it's interesting because it is imagine Fifth Avenue like it's very Manhattan like city, but ringed by the remnants of favelas and extreme poverty.

689
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:07,202
Speaker 0: And also imagine if Manhattan had a murder rate.

690
00:42:07,604 --> 00:42:10,908
Speaker 0: that was to the point that like you would have a bodyguard if you could afford it.

691
00:42:12,051 --> 00:42:19,510
Speaker 1: I really like those one scene with Sao Paulo where he was not doing well and they healed him with, you know, Portuguese.

692
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:25,490
Speaker 0: Hong Kong brings some shitty Portuguese cigarettes that are close enough and some, you know, some Brazilian cigarettes.

693
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:29,050
Speaker 0: And then they get some Portuguese canned ice cream treats out of the freezer.

694
00:42:29,903 --> 00:42:30,050
Speaker 1: Right.

695
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:30,830
Speaker 1: That was at the freeze.

696
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:31,412
Speaker 1: And I was like.

697
00:42:31,432 --> 00:42:39,070
Speaker 1: I was like, dang, I'm like, does that mean like if I go to some other place and I get hurt that I could get healed with pizza and bagels?

698
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:43,070
Speaker 1: I mean, I could be in big trouble because where the fuck are they going to get any pizza and bagels from?

699
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,669
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

700
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:49,390
Speaker 0: You're running around Seattle like I got to find a bagel and some quarter water stat.

701
00:42:50,338 --> 00:42:50,570
Speaker 1: Right.

702
00:42:50,691 --> 00:42:52,890
Speaker 1: It's like I'm in trouble if I leave here.

703
00:42:53,335 --> 00:42:54,589
Speaker 1: Maybe that's why I don't leave here.

704
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:55,030
Speaker 1: Right.

705
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:55,340
Speaker 1: Yeah.

706
00:42:55,732 --> 00:42:58,470
Speaker 1: You know, the fantasy is reality in that sense.

707
00:43:00,392 --> 00:43:01,830
Speaker 0: Anyway, I guess it's white.

708
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:02,728
Speaker 0: The only other character.

709
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:03,190
Speaker 0: Right.

710
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:06,029
Speaker 1: So that's the main the main conflict of this book.

711
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:06,630
Speaker 1: Right.

712
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:10,330
Speaker 1: Is really, you know, you know, it talks about all the issues.

713
00:43:10,723 --> 00:43:10,910
Speaker 1: Right.

714
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:14,210
Speaker 1: But, you know, the gentrification is the main issue that's going on.

715
00:43:14,331 --> 00:43:14,453
Speaker 0: Mrs.

716
00:43:14,493 --> 00:43:15,910
Speaker 0: White represents so many things.

717
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:17,830
Speaker 0: She represents global capitalism.

718
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:19,370
Speaker 0: She represents gentrification.

719
00:43:19,893 --> 00:43:22,730
Speaker 0: She represents the imaginary city of really.

720
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:27,850
Speaker 0: Which is the which is the almost literal stereotype.

721
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:36,650
Speaker 0: This is what we've been dancing around the whole time of how racist white people who don't understand cities think cities are alive.

722
00:43:36,951 --> 00:43:38,049
Speaker 1: So throughout the book.

723
00:43:38,197 --> 00:43:38,370
Speaker 1: Right.

724
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:41,530
Speaker 1: There's clearly some sort of, you know, evil monster.

725
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:44,609
Speaker 1: There's something about multiple dimensions that they keep alluding to.

726
00:43:44,879 --> 00:43:44,984
Speaker 1: Right.

727
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:55,370
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, and they can see that like on the Starbucks, there's all these white scene at the end where all this all the national chains are where the evil fungus clumps first.

728
00:43:56,332 --> 00:43:56,840
Speaker 0: That's just.

729
00:43:56,921 --> 00:43:57,510
Speaker 0: that's how it is.

730
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:58,403
Speaker 0: That's really how it is.

731
00:43:59,301 --> 00:43:59,469
Speaker 1: Yep.

732
00:43:59,692 --> 00:44:00,128
Speaker 1: Pretty much.

733
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:10,529
Speaker 1: You know, it's like, you know, the non it's like, yeah, there are some new things in the city that are like, you know, yeah, it's like they're new, but it's like New York is always changing.

734
00:44:10,741 --> 00:44:10,890
Speaker 1: Right.

735
00:44:10,951 --> 00:44:12,570
Speaker 1: Just because it's new doesn't mean it's not New York.

736
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:12,998
Speaker 1: Right.

737
00:44:14,171 --> 00:44:17,810
Speaker 1: But there are things that are, you know, not New York.

738
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:18,270
Speaker 1: Right.

739
00:44:18,351 --> 00:44:19,470
Speaker 1: They don't belong.

740
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:25,390
Speaker 1: It's like even if you're in the real world, it's like, yeah, that state, you know, it's like, ah, there's a crappy tourist gift shop.

741
00:44:25,851 --> 00:44:29,050
Speaker 1: There's a bodega and there's a Chick-fil-A.

742
00:44:29,512 --> 00:44:30,669
Speaker 1: It's like that doesn't fit.

743
00:44:30,991 --> 00:44:31,690
Speaker 0: Chick-fil-A doesn't belong there.

744
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:33,010
Speaker 1: That doesn't belong here.

745
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:40,149
Speaker 0: Like the Applebee's in Times Square belongs there, but no other Applebee's in Manhattan belongs there.

746
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:41,610
Speaker 1: Exactly.

747
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:46,469
Speaker 1: If you was an Applebee's in, you know, I guess there was one in Astoria, but it didn't belong there.

748
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:47,788
Speaker 1: I guess it's still there.

749
00:44:48,532 --> 00:44:50,810
Speaker 0: Starbucks has existed in New York and that's fine.

750
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:54,710
Speaker 0: But Starbucks is up here to replace literally everything over time.

751
00:44:55,013 --> 00:44:56,950
Speaker 0: And then they're eventually replaced by banks.

752
00:44:57,865 --> 00:44:57,970
Speaker 1: Right.

753
00:44:58,010 --> 00:44:58,588
Speaker 1: It's like they're a new.

754
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:01,290
Speaker 1: So an example of a new thing that fits right.

755
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:04,310
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, someone opened up yet another boba place.

756
00:45:05,072 --> 00:45:07,930
Speaker 1: It's like, it's like, yeah, that, you know, that fits that.

757
00:45:08,471 --> 00:45:13,390
Speaker 0: I got there like six boba places here now and like in our neighborhood, maybe more.

758
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:14,008
Speaker 1: Exactly.

759
00:45:15,455 --> 00:45:16,770
Speaker 1: You know, it's just there anyway.

760
00:45:17,193 --> 00:45:19,330
Speaker 1: So that's where there's all these white tentacles.

761
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:21,821
Speaker 1: And the characters are, you know, the New York.

762
00:45:21,861 --> 00:45:24,408
Speaker 1: characters are trying to get together to help.

763
00:45:24,964 --> 00:45:25,130
Speaker 1: Right.

764
00:45:25,251 --> 00:45:27,889
Speaker 1: And then find the main New York.

765
00:45:28,261 --> 00:45:28,470
Speaker 1: Right.

766
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:29,430
Speaker 1: The primary.

767
00:45:31,293 --> 00:45:32,350
Speaker 1: And simultaneously.

768
00:45:33,104 --> 00:45:33,290
Speaker 1: Right.

769
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:34,588
Speaker 1: There's, you know, Mrs.

770
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:41,770
Speaker 1: White, who is right up to no good and is clearly, you know, a Lovecraftian horror of sorts.

771
00:45:41,871 --> 00:45:42,080
Speaker 1: Right.

772
00:45:42,551 --> 00:45:46,070
Speaker 0: Both figuratively and in the story, literally.

773
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:47,070
Speaker 0: I love that.

774
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:49,009
Speaker 1: That's that's the part I didn't catch.

775
00:45:49,238 --> 00:45:49,450
Speaker 1: Right.

776
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:52,510
Speaker 1: Until, you know, later I was like, oh, that was so obvious.

777
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:58,070
Speaker 0: The first time when Staten Island asks her where you're from and she doesn't understand.

778
00:45:58,212 --> 00:46:02,870
Speaker 0: And we knew it started with an R. And I didn't I just I was like, I'll bet that'll come back later.

779
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:03,910
Speaker 0: And I was trying to figure it out.

780
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:05,330
Speaker 1: I didn't think about the starting with an R.

781
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:06,389
Speaker 0: I thought about it, but I did.

782
00:46:06,692 --> 00:46:08,069
Speaker 0: I don't I did not figure it out then.

783
00:46:08,231 --> 00:46:09,830
Speaker 0: Don't I'm not even going to pretend I did.

784
00:46:10,214 --> 00:46:11,889
Speaker 0: I kept every time it came up.

785
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:14,769
Speaker 0: I was like, are are what could it be?

786
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,228
Speaker 0: It's not just gentrification.

787
00:46:16,811 --> 00:46:17,310
Speaker 0: Like it's got it.

788
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:17,948
Speaker 0: What could it be?

789
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:18,910
Speaker 0: What's the R word?

790
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:19,928
Speaker 0: They wouldn't have brought it up.

791
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:23,170
Speaker 1: I miss I guess I missed the part with the R hint and maybe I would have found it earlier.

792
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:27,190
Speaker 0: There are three instances where the R hint comes up before it is revealed.

793
00:46:28,331 --> 00:46:32,089
Speaker 0: Because every time Staten Island has lost over that she's thinking about the R again.

794
00:46:33,652 --> 00:46:36,110
Speaker 0: And she can't quite pronounce it anyway.

795
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:37,088
Speaker 1: So this you know, Mrs.

796
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:38,610
Speaker 1: White is all over making trouble.

797
00:46:38,994 --> 00:46:40,307
Speaker 1: Monster in the bathroom scene.

798
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:42,650
Speaker 1: You know, fucking people up.

799
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:44,250
Speaker 0: Like what are her appearances?

800
00:46:44,632 --> 00:46:47,190
Speaker 1: Sending Nazis to to fuck up the museum.

801
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:52,590
Speaker 0: But also sending a white lady with a cell phone calling the cops on someone in the park.

802
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:53,834
Speaker 0: Like.

803
00:46:53,854 --> 00:46:57,750
Speaker 0: that is so exactly how they are and how that problem is.

804
00:46:58,050 --> 00:46:58,190
Speaker 0: Yep.

805
00:46:58,711 --> 00:47:02,030
Speaker 1: It's basically all the bad things that are happening in New York.

806
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:02,219
Speaker 1: Right.

807
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:03,908
Speaker 1: Have these tentacles on them.

808
00:47:04,051 --> 00:47:04,349
Speaker 1: Right.

809
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:07,469
Speaker 1: That only the New York characters can see that like are identifying them.

810
00:47:08,052 --> 00:47:14,510
Speaker 1: You know, as like, yeah, this is, you know, they're trying to prevent New York from being born for some reason.

811
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:20,319
Speaker 1: And the whole time you're thinking it's, you know, this is some sort of interdimensional war going on.

812
00:47:20,399 --> 00:47:21,770
Speaker 1: that, you know, between cities.

813
00:47:21,991 --> 00:47:22,647
Speaker 0: Well, the way Mrs.

814
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:30,210
Speaker 0: White describes it to the only person who asks her, which is Staten Island, is, oh, if a city is born, it destroys countless realities.

815
00:47:30,351 --> 00:47:34,250
Speaker 0: It's very much a bokurano type plot.

816
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,169
Speaker 1: But something like that.

817
00:47:36,551 --> 00:47:48,448
Speaker 0: But that's also very much a misrepresentation to edging on the point of an outright lie, because it turns out later, of course, no, she represents a city just like any other city doing the same thing.

818
00:47:48,971 --> 00:47:54,390
Speaker 0: But I like the dual purpose that serves, because on one hand, white supremacy just lies to people.

819
00:47:54,531 --> 00:47:58,189
Speaker 0: It lies straight up to Staten Island, and she believes it because she wants to.

820
00:47:59,011 --> 00:48:07,870
Speaker 0: All her tendrils in the city, like the people, the corrupt cops and the proud boys who wear the tentacles, they wear them because they wanted to.

821
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:12,870
Speaker 0: They wanted to believe that that's in them, because it's making this point that New York is full of racists.

822
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:13,452
Speaker 0: We're not going to.

823
00:48:13,674 --> 00:48:16,370
Speaker 0: New York may vote Democrat and maybe a really great place.

824
00:48:16,711 --> 00:48:20,410
Speaker 0: But this book does not pretend that New York is not full of a lot of really shitty people.

825
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:22,250
Speaker 0: There are shitty people everywhere.

826
00:48:22,911 --> 00:48:35,628
Speaker 0: But it also makes this point that cities naturally gravitate toward minimizing the damage those people do, because you can't be that openly shitty in a city surrounded by millions of people without getting knocked the fuck out.

827
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:39,010
Speaker 1: Yep, pretty much anyway.

828
00:48:39,311 --> 00:48:40,563
Speaker 1: So this Mrs.

829
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:49,029
Speaker 1: White is basically creating trouble and pursuing the characters right the whole time, you know, and whatnot.

830
00:48:49,832 --> 00:48:54,827
Speaker 1: And then, you know, they get they're trying to go get Staten Island and that doesn't go so well.

831
00:48:55,139 --> 00:48:55,348
Speaker 1: Right.

832
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:56,453
Speaker 0: I love Staten Island.

833
00:48:56,553 --> 00:49:06,470
Speaker 0: straight up joins them, like joins her, gives up, becomes the white supremacist Nazi stronghold for really, yeah, the Lovecraftian city.

834
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:08,407
Speaker 0: Like that was an interesting place to end.

835
00:49:09,992 --> 00:49:17,990
Speaker 1: So I think the thing there's another layer to it, right, which is that, you know, in term it's still a fantasy novel for nerds in addition to being a New York novel.

836
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:18,428
Speaker 1: Right.

837
00:49:18,971 --> 00:49:23,030
Speaker 1: And, you know, Lovecraft and Lovecraftian horror universe is public domain.

838
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:23,628
Speaker 1: It's so old.

839
00:49:23,733 --> 00:49:23,926
Speaker 1: Right.

840
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:28,110
Speaker 1: But also it's something that, you know, has a place in nerd culture.

841
00:49:28,592 --> 00:49:33,369
Speaker 0: I mean, my parents introduced me to Lovecraft before it was pop culture known like.

842
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:35,209
Speaker 0: that was something I was reading in elementary school.

843
00:49:35,955 --> 00:49:37,210
Speaker 0: I didn't know about his racism.

844
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:43,070
Speaker 0: I was just reading it as a naive kid about like, oh, it's existential, non-Euclidean cyclopean horror.

845
00:49:43,193 --> 00:49:43,746
Speaker 0: I'm into this.

846
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:45,249
Speaker 1: Right, exactly.

847
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:53,010
Speaker 1: So, you know, but more recently, indeed, you know, there has been a greater focus on the fact that, yeah, Lovecraft is a really awful person.

848
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:56,050
Speaker 1: His actual works, you know, how great were they really?

849
00:49:56,150 --> 00:50:11,830
Speaker 0: Well, even if they are great at face value, if you know the context of what he believes and you read them again, you cannot escape the fact that all of his non-Euclidean stuff is basically just code for non-white people and cities.

850
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:29,070
Speaker 1: So, you know, as nerds, right, we had this Lovecraftian thing that was like one of our nerd staples and was actually public domain, you know, and people were using it for all kinds of stuff and enjoying it, right, in a not racist way, right, despite its origins.

851
00:50:29,511 --> 00:50:38,790
Speaker 1: But more of more recent times, right, it's sort of been, you know, less attractive, right, because, you know, there's more focus on the reality of who Lovecraft was.

852
00:50:39,551 --> 00:51:12,331
Speaker 1: And in this book, by making, you know, Relay, right, and, you know, the fantasy of Lovecraft's universe and the city from it, right, the literal enemy, and also white supremacist at the same time, right, the story is able to, right, on the one hand, you know, point out the truth, right, and denounce it strongly, but also be able to tell a story about, right, you

853
00:51:12,351 --> 00:51:13,114
Speaker 0: know, all those

854
00:51:13,194 --> 00:51:19,450
Speaker 1: classic Lovecraftian things, right, tentacle monsters, right, multidimensional scary things.

855
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:25,349
Speaker 0: Oh, that scene where they try to kill the Bronx with the painting that would have sucked them into, really, yeah, was fantastic.

856
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:31,065
Speaker 0: Well, it would have sucked them into what the kind of person... It was very clear, it was...

857
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:34,768
Speaker 1: Non-Euclidean geometries, right, all the tropes of the...

858
00:51:35,552 --> 00:51:45,630
Speaker 0: I read that scene, I thought about that scene a lot, because it's very much... That is what New York looks like to shitty people who have never been here and hate this city for no reason.

859
00:51:46,911 --> 00:51:53,050
Speaker 0: They see it as a filthy city full of piss reek and immigrants and violence, because they're shitty people.

860
00:51:53,451 --> 00:51:57,190
Speaker 0: They don't know what it's actually like here, and that's how a lot of people who complain about New York feel.

861
00:51:57,610 --> 00:52:04,789
Speaker 0: Even tourists who come here and just go to Times Square, go home and think New York sucks, and frankly, great, never come back, you're not the kind of person we want here.

862
00:52:06,251 --> 00:52:16,870
Speaker 1: But, you know, by making it the villain in that way, it's like, look, she was able to tell, right, and sort of take back the Lovecraftian horror and use it, right?

863
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:22,390
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, by making it the white supremacist villain in that way, and that's sort of like a genius move.

864
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:33,070
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, it's like, you know, if you were just to, you know, write a Lovecraftian horror normally, nowadays, it's sort of like, eh, it's all right, what are you doing, man?

865
00:52:33,211 --> 00:52:34,710
Speaker 1: It's like, that's not good, right?

866
00:52:35,075 --> 00:52:35,608
Speaker 1: Don't do that.

867
00:52:35,971 --> 00:52:40,110
Speaker 1: But here it's like, no, we'll take it back for the nerds, right, the right way.

868
00:52:40,451 --> 00:52:46,427
Speaker 0: But that's the moment when I started figuring it out, that it was literal love, because Lovecraft gets...

869
00:52:46,570 --> 00:53:02,750
Speaker 1: I knew that it was Lovecraftian in nature with all the tentacles and, you know, and everything, but the fact that she was literally also a city, right, got away from me because up until that point, every city was a real city on Earth, geographically, right?

870
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:11,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there's a point where one of the, they're talking about how cities like Atlantis, when they talked about Atlantis is what I figured.

871
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:13,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's when you, at that point, it's revealed, basically.

872
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:19,350
Speaker 0: Yep, because Atlantis was a city that existed and ceased to exist.

873
00:53:19,451 --> 00:53:21,770
Speaker 0: So in our reality, it never existed.

874
00:53:22,731 --> 00:53:24,289
Speaker 0: It was a fiction, it's a fictional city.

875
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:32,709
Speaker 0: So really, yeah, literal fictional city from our current reality, meaning it is perfectly fair game to be a city in this universe.

876
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:39,992
Speaker 1: Yeah, but, you know, but also it's like, you know, there was, I didn't realize that, you know, Mrs.

877
00:53:40,033 --> 00:53:43,030
Speaker 1: White was a city because of the interdimensionality aspect.

878
00:53:43,232 --> 00:53:45,190
Speaker 1: I thought that there were like some aliens or something.

879
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:47,170
Speaker 0: Well, because she was lying to Staten Island.

880
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:57,107
Speaker 0: There was some other, or maybe like a city from some other dimension, you know, not from a real city on the scale of Sao Paulo or New York or Hong Kong or London.

881
00:53:57,147 --> 00:54:02,869
Speaker 0: in the real world is built on the backs of millions and millions of dead and exploited people.

882
00:54:03,951 --> 00:54:09,070
Speaker 0: You know, even a city that's trying to do good has ruined lots of people along the way.

883
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:11,109
Speaker 0: That's just how history has always been.

884
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:15,670
Speaker 0: And all the other cities in this book don't shy away from that.

885
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:16,634
Speaker 0: But Mrs.

886
00:54:16,735 --> 00:54:19,070
Speaker 0: White doesn't say she's a city.

887
00:54:19,512 --> 00:54:23,830
Speaker 0: She just talks about that death and points out all those other cities are causing it.

888
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:26,090
Speaker 0: Just openly lies to Staten Island.

889
00:54:27,454 --> 00:54:28,585
Speaker 0: I thought that was a very nice touch.

890
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:29,886
Speaker 1: Yeah.

891
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:35,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, just, you know, there's just so many of those kinds of alignments, right?

892
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:44,057
Speaker 1: It's just like, it's like, you know, it's like you could, if you tried to think of something, like you could think of a few, but it's like, how much work must it have been to write this book?

893
00:54:44,411 --> 00:54:54,069
Speaker 1: And basically almost every sentence is like some new alignment of, right, the characters and the reality of the world that we live in.

894
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:58,762
Speaker 1: While also evoking some other fictional works that evoke something.

895
00:54:58,983 --> 00:55:08,950
Speaker 0: so, so New York, I could almost smell the subway when Manhattan summons a spectral idea of a subway car to escape.

896
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:13,767
Speaker 0: Like the way the magic works is just real fun in this book, too.

897
00:55:17,786 --> 00:55:18,859
Speaker 1: It's a super New York book.

898
00:55:20,022 --> 00:55:21,238
Speaker 1: You know, it's also a fantasy book.

899
00:55:21,822 --> 00:55:26,640
Speaker 1: It takes back, you know, Lovecraftian horror from the white supremacists.

900
00:55:28,821 --> 00:55:35,260
Speaker 0: You know, yeah, I cannot, I cannot recommend this book to anyone who can read English or a translated version of it.

901
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,660
Speaker 0: Even this book is so fantastic.

902
00:55:37,121 --> 00:55:45,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's such, I just, you know, I asked some of the listener, but, you know, the, they mentioned, you know, I was like, hey, if you don't know anything about New York, right, how does this book come across?

903
00:55:45,869 --> 00:55:46,080
Speaker 1: Right.

904
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:48,940
Speaker 0: It's like, well, we got in the chat to Canucks.

905
00:55:49,482 --> 00:55:53,260
Speaker 0: I guess just enjoying this unique glimpse into big city Americana.

906
00:55:54,885 --> 00:55:55,778
Speaker 0: Is it really like that?

907
00:55:56,820 --> 00:56:01,038
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's I'll tell you what, we'll keep the city part and we're going to trade health care parts.

908
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:08,118
Speaker 0: We had one New Yorker in my book club, but we couldn't tell how much she was joking when she said that Aislinn was, quote, spot on.

909
00:56:09,506 --> 00:56:10,319
Speaker 1: Not joking at all.

910
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:13,079
Speaker 0: I'm glad I skipped the Staten Island Ferry when I visited New York.

911
00:56:13,761 --> 00:56:15,880
Speaker 1: It actually, the ferry is worth riding.

912
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:18,600
Speaker 1: The Staten Island Ferry is not a waste of time.

913
00:56:18,781 --> 00:56:22,160
Speaker 0: I would say the Staten Island Ferry is very New York.

914
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,579
Speaker 0: Staten Island is not.

915
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:25,299
Speaker 0: But the Staten Island Ferry is.

916
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,300
Speaker 0: So I'm going to give you the lowdown.

917
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:26,869
Speaker 0: Right.

918
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:33,100
Speaker 1: If you're a tourist and you come to if you're a tourist and you come to New York, right, you're probably going to want to see some Statue of Liberty.

919
00:56:33,368 --> 00:56:33,580
Speaker 1: Right.

920
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:44,880
Speaker 1: Which is, you know, if you look at a map and figure out where it is, if you don't understand, but it's out in the water like it's if you go to if you try to go to the bottom of Manhattan and look at it, you're going to need like some binoculars to see anything.

921
00:56:45,382 --> 00:56:46,999
Speaker 0: And there are tour boats that will take you to it.

922
00:56:47,284 --> 00:56:48,180
Speaker 0: The Staten Island Ferry.

923
00:56:48,563 --> 00:56:50,479
Speaker 1: There is an official boat that will take you.

924
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:51,700
Speaker 1: It is not cheap.

925
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:52,718
Speaker 1: It's a pain in the ass.

926
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,099
Speaker 1: It's not really worth it.

927
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:59,059
Speaker 1: You know, it's like, OK, you stand at the bottom of it and it's a little island with a statue on it and then you come back.

928
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:01,700
Speaker 1: And I don't know if they're letting people to the top anymore.

929
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:03,280
Speaker 0: They haven't for a long time.

930
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:06,720
Speaker 1: I don't know if they started again, but even if they do, it's not easy.

931
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:07,718
Speaker 1: And you probably won't.

932
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,440
Speaker 0: Staten Island Ferry goes past it twice.

933
00:57:11,264 --> 00:57:11,540
Speaker 0: Real close.

934
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:16,120
Speaker 1: You can get on the Staten Island Ferry for free for no money whatsoever.

935
00:57:16,282 --> 00:57:17,980
Speaker 1: You just get you just wait for it to come.

936
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,140
Speaker 1: You get on it and you look out the window.

937
00:57:20,902 --> 00:57:22,899
Speaker 1: Make sure you're sitting on the New Jersey side of the boat.

938
00:57:23,191 --> 00:57:23,318
Speaker 1: Right.

939
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:24,760
Speaker 1: So you can see the Statue of Liberty.

940
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:28,599
Speaker 0: Literally the best way to see it short of hiring a private helicopter to take you to it.

941
00:57:29,252 --> 00:57:29,420
Speaker 1: Yeah.

942
00:57:29,501 --> 00:57:29,888
Speaker 1: And it's like.

943
00:57:29,908 --> 00:57:30,478
Speaker 1: you'll see it.

944
00:57:30,701 --> 00:57:33,000
Speaker 1: You'll see, you know, you have a free boat ride.

945
00:57:33,242 --> 00:57:34,760
Speaker 1: It won't take very long at all.

946
00:57:35,001 --> 00:57:35,798
Speaker 1: It costs zero dollars.

947
00:57:36,201 --> 00:57:39,700
Speaker 1: Then when you get to Staten Island, just wait for the boat to take you right back.

948
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,019
Speaker 1: Don't do anything on Staten Island.

949
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:42,560
Speaker 0: So you're burying the lead, though.

950
00:57:43,144 --> 00:57:45,220
Speaker 0: The Staten Island Ferry is free.

951
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:50,060
Speaker 0: And there are a ton of people who will sell you tickets to it in New York.

952
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:50,520
Speaker 1: Yep.

953
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:59,800
Speaker 1: There are scammers who stand all around the battery area near the ferry terminal trying to sell tickets to the Staten Island Ferry to tourists who don't know that it's free.

954
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:01,198
Speaker 1: You can just go on it.

955
00:58:01,681 --> 00:58:02,640
Speaker 1: No money whatsoever.

956
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:08,060
Speaker 1: Don't buy a ticket to it unless you're, you know, want to make a donation, I guess.

957
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:08,974
Speaker 0: Yeah.

958
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,054
Speaker 0: So, yeah, I really come to the.

959
00:58:12,094 --> 00:58:12,940
Speaker 0: come to the Geek Nights Forum.

960
00:58:13,324 --> 00:58:14,000
Speaker 0: Come to the Discord.

961
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,099
Speaker 0: Talk about this book with us.

962
00:58:15,441 --> 00:58:19,240
Speaker 0: If you've never been to New York, we really want to know what you thought of this book.

963
00:58:20,221 --> 00:58:24,780
Speaker 0: And I really want to stress to you that living here does feel the way that book is like.

964
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:25,980
Speaker 0: We're not exaggerating.

965
00:58:26,041 --> 00:58:27,315
Speaker 0: And if you ever come here, you'll see it.

966
00:58:28,322 --> 00:58:28,538
Speaker 1: All right.

967
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:37,640
Speaker 1: So now that we've gotten away with doing a book club book in less than two and a half years, right, we got to make up for lost time and do more books more frequently.

968
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:37,785
Speaker 1: Right.

969
00:58:38,801 --> 00:58:52,120
Speaker 1: So I the next book club book, you know, usually me and rim alternate choosing right here, even though I guess it's, you know, it's my B that I chose the Genji book, but it's still my turn anyway.

970
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:52,674
Speaker 1: Tough shit.

971
00:58:54,194 --> 00:58:54,340
Speaker 1: Right.

972
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,479
Speaker 1: One pick is one pick, no matter how long it takes.

973
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:03,780
Speaker 1: So but I'm not going to use my pick right in penance for my previous pick.

974
00:59:03,901 --> 00:59:05,440
Speaker 1: I'm going to give this pick away.

975
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:06,460
Speaker 1: Right.

976
00:59:06,641 --> 00:59:08,531
Speaker 1: And I've given my pick away not to rim.

977
00:59:09,093 --> 00:59:10,360
Speaker 1: rim rim has enough picks.

978
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:12,019
Speaker 1: He's going to get 50 percent of the picks.

979
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:12,373
Speaker 1: Yeah.

980
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:15,640
Speaker 1: I'm going to give my pick away to the listener.

981
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:16,520
Speaker 1: Right.

982
00:59:16,842 --> 00:59:19,560
Speaker 1: And the listener has already made their pick right there.

983
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:26,720
Speaker 1: The listener has been hounding us to read a particular book club book for quite a long time.

984
00:59:28,082 --> 00:59:31,479
Speaker 1: And after I finished Genji, I already read the book.

985
00:59:32,022 --> 00:59:35,199
Speaker 1: I went ahead and I read the book that the listener has been asking for.

986
00:59:35,665 --> 00:59:36,497
Speaker 1: I've already finished it.

987
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,116
Speaker 1: Rim hasn't read a page of it.

988
00:59:40,321 --> 00:59:46,200
Speaker 1: And I can see why the listener has chosen this book as a geek nights book club book.

989
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,619
Speaker 1: There are many geek nights things in it.

990
00:59:50,742 --> 00:59:51,546
Speaker 1: And it wasn't.

991
00:59:51,566 --> 00:59:52,249
Speaker 1: you know, it was.

992
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:54,479
Speaker 1: I guess it's worthy enough of being a book club book.

993
00:59:54,922 --> 00:59:57,199
Speaker 1: So let's let's let the listener have their day.

994
00:59:58,362 --> 01:00:05,818
Speaker 1: The next geek nights book club book chosen by the listener is Nine Fox Gambit by Yoon Ha Lee.

995
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:10,440
Speaker 0: So she's been on my list for a long time also because of the listener.

996
01:00:11,882 --> 01:00:13,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, the listener has asked for this book so much.

997
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,240
Speaker 1: So it's like, fine, you know, you can have this one listener.

998
01:00:17,401 --> 01:00:18,295
Speaker 1: We'll give it to you.

999
01:00:19,009 --> 01:00:19,319
Speaker 1: All right.

1000
01:00:19,441 --> 01:00:21,840
Speaker 1: And then I guess Rim will go back to pick.

1001
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:24,800
Speaker 1: We'll go back to, you know, us picking again for now on.

1002
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:26,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got I got to narrow it down.

1003
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:27,560
Speaker 0: There's a lot of I got to choose.

1004
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:36,360
Speaker 0: Do I pick a book that I want an excuse to force myself to read and pull up ahead of other books in my queue or do I pick the book that's currently at the top of my queue?

1005
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:37,418
Speaker 0: That's what I got to think about.

1006
01:00:38,041 --> 01:00:48,600
Speaker 1: And just to give you a in case you want like a summary of what this book Nine Fox Gambit is about, it's right where instead of we did a fantasy book here.

1007
01:00:48,866 --> 01:00:49,140
Speaker 1: Right.

1008
01:00:49,561 --> 01:00:53,340
Speaker 1: So Nine Fox Gambit takes us back to the other nerdy realm of sci fi book.

1009
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:53,800
Speaker 1: Right.

1010
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:54,839
Speaker 1: We're going back into space.

1011
01:00:56,082 --> 01:01:09,880
Speaker 1: And basically what the story is, is that there is a space empire of sorts and they have a space station, but it's like a big fucking space station, like probably Death Star size, like this whole, you know, communities, cities living inside of it.

1012
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:10,480
Speaker 1: It's enormous.

1013
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:11,579
Speaker 0: It's no DS nine.

1014
01:01:12,742 --> 01:01:15,680
Speaker 1: And there was some sort of revolution on it of some kind.

1015
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:27,600
Speaker 1: It's been overthrown and the empire sends our main character to go and take care of that and reacquire the space station for the empire.

1016
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:33,179
Speaker 0: I found a summary that says the novel covers space opera, fantasy, Korean folklore and mathematics.

1017
01:01:34,406 --> 01:01:34,959
Speaker 1: That's correct.

1018
01:01:37,104 --> 01:01:40,580
Speaker 1: And yeah, there are, you know, you're going to get some space battles here, right?

1019
01:01:40,681 --> 01:01:43,220
Speaker 1: It is a book with a spaceship on the cover.

1020
01:01:43,782 --> 01:01:49,275
Speaker 0: Oh, I haven't read a book with a spaceship on the cover and a space battle in a while now that I think about it.

1021
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:50,291
Speaker 1: Yep.

1022
01:01:51,123 --> 01:01:53,020
Speaker 1: It's also one like a pile of awards.

1023
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:53,440
Speaker 1: Right.

1024
01:01:53,541 --> 01:01:55,880
Speaker 1: So, um, you know, probably.

1025
01:01:59,153 --> 01:01:59,460
