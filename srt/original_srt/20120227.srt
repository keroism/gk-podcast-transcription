1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,617
Speaker 0: It's Monday, February 27th, 2012.

2
00:00:10,617 --> 00:00:11,981
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:13,465
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,545 --> 00:00:15,210
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,890
Speaker 0: Tonight, we talk about content filtering and why it never works.

6
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:23,828
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,570
Speaker 1: So, something we've talked about many times in the show previously is the jury duty.

8
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:38,610
Speaker 0: Serendipitously, it appears that my old jury nullification thing was the random thing of the day tweet from the past.

9
00:00:39,011 --> 00:00:44,090
Speaker 1: At least, we still have yet to talk about jury pee, but jury duty is good.

10
00:00:45,554 --> 00:00:49,350
Speaker 1: So, I had jury duties today, which means I didn't go to work, which is, I guess, cool.

11
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:54,429
Speaker 1: Even though the alternative is sitting in a room doing nothing, which is, I guess, equal to work.

12
00:00:56,671 --> 00:01:07,630
Speaker 1: But, you know, I'm kind of actually glad I had this jury duty in Queens and I managed to get lucky and not have the jury duty in Ice Slip, Long Island, a fucking zillion miles away.

13
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:08,861
Speaker 0: That wouldn't have been that bad.

14
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:09,830
Speaker 0: You get out of work the same.

15
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:15,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's like, take the Long Island Railroad to the crack ass at dawn to the middle of nowhere.

16
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,030
Speaker 1: You know, this was take the E train to Q Gardens, you know, whatever.

17
00:01:19,511 --> 00:01:22,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm so sad that in my life I've never served on a jury.

18
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,110
Speaker 1: You're never going to serve on a jury.

19
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:33,030
Speaker 1: So, you know, I'm all out there expecting, you know, just, you know, I'm like, hey, I'm just going to go in and be 100% honest and see what happens, right?

20
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,070
Speaker 1: Because I'm figuring, well, 100% honesty is going to get me sent home.

21
00:01:37,257 --> 00:01:37,361
Speaker 0: Yeah.

22
00:01:38,456 --> 00:01:38,710
Speaker 1: Right.

23
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:44,750
Speaker 0: See, I have this conflicting problem in that I almost want to act dumber than I am just so I can get on the jury and do some good.

24
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:45,431
Speaker 1: Exactly.

25
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:51,209
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, maybe I can get some guy acquitted or at least hung on some, you know, nonviolent drug charge.

26
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,710
Speaker 1: Wait a minute, acquitted or at least hung.

27
00:01:54,032 --> 00:01:56,083
Speaker 1: Well, the jury would be hung.

28
00:01:56,305 --> 00:01:57,250
Speaker 1: The guy would be acquitted.

29
00:01:58,992 --> 00:02:04,309
Speaker 1: The point is, right, is it's like, so you go in, you sit in the room, you know, then they...

30
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:05,488
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's how it was for me.

31
00:02:05,651 --> 00:02:07,330
Speaker 1: You fill up some papers.

32
00:02:08,032 --> 00:02:10,789
Speaker 1: If you have an excuse, you hold on to your papers.

33
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,549
Speaker 1: If you don't have an excuse, you hand the papers in.

34
00:02:13,271 --> 00:02:18,010
Speaker 1: It takes like an hour to hand the papers in and then for everyone to go up and try to make their excuses.

35
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,229
Speaker 1: But actually, it seemed like most of the people making excuses got let go.

36
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:28,350
Speaker 1: And they gave a big thing like, these are the valid excuses, these are the not valid excuses.

37
00:02:29,111 --> 00:02:33,890
Speaker 1: And I guess most of the people heard properly because most of the people were leaving with their valid excuses.

38
00:02:34,191 --> 00:02:38,870
Speaker 0: Or the guy handing out the excuse papers was just saying okay to everything.

39
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,055
Speaker 1: I don't know about that.

40
00:02:40,135 --> 00:02:42,590
Speaker 1: They seemed like they were pretty strict.

41
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:48,025
Speaker 1: Anyway, so then they take a big blob of people and I learned something.

42
00:02:48,065 --> 00:02:49,409
Speaker 1: It's called voir dire.

43
00:02:50,511 --> 00:02:52,010
Speaker 0: So you didn't know about that already?

44
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:52,808
Speaker 1: I didn't know that word.

45
00:02:53,231 --> 00:02:53,848
Speaker 0: Okay, now you know.

46
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:58,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was in the really bad instructional video.

47
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,129
Speaker 0: Didn't you take like social studies class?

48
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,429
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I didn't learn that word.

49
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:03,170
Speaker 0: Didn't you ever watch a crime drama?

50
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,250
Speaker 1: Uh, well like, what counts?

51
00:03:06,831 --> 00:03:09,088
Speaker 0: I don't know, anything that had like jury selection in it.

52
00:03:11,038 --> 00:03:12,490
Speaker 1: Uh, 12 Angry Men starts after that part.

53
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway.

54
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:14,970
Speaker 0: Anyway.

55
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:20,830
Speaker 0: Actually, I know all about it partly because I played this old PC game, long time ago, called Juris-diction.

56
00:03:21,478 --> 00:03:21,890
Speaker 1: Oh god.

57
00:03:22,031 --> 00:03:23,769
Speaker 0: And you had to go through like voir dire.

58
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,910
Speaker 1: Don't give me that Juris-my-diction crap.

59
00:03:26,412 --> 00:03:31,790
Speaker 0: And the game was basically, the other lawyer would be interrogating someone and you would object to pretty much everything.

60
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,866
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't see that kid in Phoenix, right?

61
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,177
Speaker 0: But you had to know the right objection.

62
00:03:36,197 --> 00:03:39,370
Speaker 0: There were like 10 objections, just like a keyboard, and like hit the right one.

63
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,514
Speaker 1: Yeah, the instructional video is pretty awful.

64
00:03:42,035 --> 00:03:48,670
Speaker 1: It's supposed to be hosted on the New York Juris-dot-gov website, but there was a 404 if you actually clicked the link to watch the video.

65
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:49,808
Speaker 0: So how did you watch it?

66
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:51,610
Speaker 1: They just play it on TVs for everyone.

67
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:58,790
Speaker 1: The TVs pretty much alternate between either, you know, pretty much when they're not making any announcements, they put it on TV, like ABC, and it's annoying.

68
00:03:59,731 --> 00:04:07,230
Speaker 1: Or, when they're trying to talk to you, they switch it over to the DVD and you just see the DVD menu sitting there quietly while they talk to you.

69
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,870
Speaker 1: And then they play the video once, after all the people who made excuses left.

70
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:18,370
Speaker 1: Then after the video, they call a bunch of names, which I assume they picked randomly from the, you know, paper works.

71
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:25,290
Speaker 1: And, you know, those people, they got them together and they said something to them, which I couldn't completely hear being far away from them.

72
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:27,214
Speaker 1: And then they took them away.

73
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:30,824
Speaker 1: And then, an hour later, they did that same thing again.

74
00:04:30,844 --> 00:04:32,770
Speaker 1: They took a blob of people and they sent them away.

75
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,803
Speaker 1: And then after they sent those people away, they said, "Alright, everyone who's left, you're going home.

76
00:04:37,823 --> 00:04:39,707
Speaker 1: You're not coming back for four

77
00:04:39,748 --> 00:04:40,068
Speaker 1: years.".

78
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,545
Speaker 1: And they said, "When we call your name, come up and get your paper and go

79
00:04:43,907 --> 00:04:44,068
Speaker 1: home.".

80
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,237
Speaker 1: And they're like, "Don't go to work.

81
00:04:46,297 --> 00:04:48,064
Speaker 1: The paper we're giving you says nine to five.

82
00:04:48,446 --> 00:04:49,289
Speaker 1: You don't have to go to

83
00:04:49,309 --> 00:04:49,490
Speaker 1: work.".

84
00:04:50,433 --> 00:04:51,770
Speaker 0: See, at least they're cool on that front.

85
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:54,250
Speaker 0: They pretty much did the same thing for me before.

86
00:04:54,830 --> 00:05:00,628
Speaker 1: The thing is, like, if I would have gone into, you know, a thing, right, it's like I would have been completely honest, so...

87
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,589
Speaker 0: You still wouldn't have served on that jury.

88
00:05:02,951 --> 00:05:03,714
Speaker 1: It depends, right?

89
00:05:03,755 --> 00:05:06,650
Speaker 1: Like, if it was a murder trial, you know, what questions were they going to ask?

90
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,535
Speaker 1: They're going to ask, "What's your

91
00:05:07,555 --> 00:05:08,100
Speaker 1: occupation?".

92
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,483
Speaker 1: "I'm a

93
00:05:08,523 --> 00:05:09,087
Speaker 1: programmer.".

94
00:05:10,358 --> 00:05:10,882
Speaker 1: "Do you have

95
00:05:10,983 --> 00:05:11,427
Speaker 1: anything?"

96
00:05:11,568 --> 00:05:11,769
Speaker 1: Maybe.

97
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:16,909
Speaker 1: You know, "Is there any reason that, you know, you wouldn't be able to judge fairly in a murder

98
00:05:16,929 --> 00:05:17,190
Speaker 1: trial?".

99
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,772
Speaker 1: Well, no.

100
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:20,201
Speaker 1: I could judge fairly in a murder trial, right?

101
00:05:21,044 --> 00:05:22,590
Speaker 1: By the evidence only and such.

102
00:05:23,711 --> 00:05:24,770
Speaker 0: Wait a minute, by the evidence only.

103
00:05:26,992 --> 00:05:31,990
Speaker 1: You know, and that would be, you know, they probably would have put me on.

104
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:38,910
Speaker 0: I am confident that if I answer honestly in any sort of jury selection, I will never serve on an American jury in my entire life.

105
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:43,067
Speaker 1: The thing is, they don't, the thing is, they have to ask the question that you would answer honestly.

106
00:05:43,087 --> 00:05:43,910
Speaker 1: that would get you sent off.

107
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,410
Speaker 1: And they don't really, I don't get the feeling they don't really ask that many questions.

108
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:50,970
Speaker 0: From what I've read, they'll let you off for a lot of surprising things.

109
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:55,949
Speaker 0: Like, they don't like, I mean, I don't know if this is necessarily true, but I remember reading a long article talking about how...

110
00:05:56,331 --> 00:05:57,726
Speaker 1: I still don't know the answer because I didn't...

111
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,677
Speaker 0: They prefer women to men.

112
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,590
Speaker 0: They prefer older people to young people.

113
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:02,999
Speaker 0: Okay.

114
00:06:03,412 --> 00:06:04,309
Speaker 0: And stuff like that.

115
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:08,770
Speaker 0: They also don't like technologists or scientists or anyone in a technical field of any kind.

116
00:06:09,191 --> 00:06:09,930
Speaker 1: Ah, that's true.

117
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,348
Speaker 0: Yeah.

118
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:17,510
Speaker 1: But, you know, the whole thing is, like, I didn't even get to find out if, like, any of that stuff is gonna matter because they sent my ass home.

119
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've never gotten to the point of actually being questioned, too.

120
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,436
Speaker 0: They let me go the first time.

121
00:06:21,456 --> 00:06:22,584
Speaker 0: They were like, "Oh, you work in a hospital?

122
00:06:22,624 --> 00:06:22,966
Speaker 0: Don, go

123
00:06:22,987 --> 00:06:23,128
Speaker 0: home.".

124
00:06:24,515 --> 00:06:24,803
Speaker 0: That was it.

125
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:29,090
Speaker 0: And the time before that, I forget why they let me go.

126
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,830
Speaker 0: They just, I think they just let me go after never calling me, kind of like happened to you.

127
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, you wanna hear a funny story?

128
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:33,365
Speaker 1: Maybe.

129
00:06:34,112 --> 00:06:35,230
Speaker 1: So, it's not that funny.

130
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:35,790
Speaker 0: I said maybe.

131
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:40,368
Speaker 1: So, you know, I tell my mom, like, "Yeah, I got jury duty on Monday, but it's in Kew

132
00:06:40,388 --> 00:06:40,690
Speaker 1: Gardens.".

133
00:06:40,913 --> 00:06:41,706
Speaker 1: And she's like, "Oh, I've been

134
00:06:41,746 --> 00:06:41,909
Speaker 1: there.".

135
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,256
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "Well, when were you there?

136
00:06:43,297 --> 00:06:45,588
Speaker 1: You haven't lived in New York in, like, a zillion years,

137
00:06:45,668 --> 00:06:45,849
Speaker 1: right?".

138
00:06:46,432 --> 00:06:47,897
Speaker 1: And she's like, "Oh, you know what it was?

139
00:06:47,937 --> 00:06:49,101
Speaker 1: I'll tell you exactly what it was.

140
00:06:49,582 --> 00:06:50,847
Speaker 1: It was pretty much 30 years

141
00:06:50,867 --> 00:06:50,927
Speaker 1: ago.".

142
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,029
Speaker 1: And she walked in and they said, "What do you

143
00:06:54,049 --> 00:06:54,129
Speaker 1: do?".

144
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,629
Speaker 1: And she said, "Two months," and they sent her home.

145
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,570
Speaker 1: So I've been there before, but I don't remember being there before.

146
00:07:02,474 --> 00:07:03,910
Speaker 0: I wonder, has it changed much?

147
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:13,590
Speaker 0: Because the last time I was called in, not only did I not own a smartphone or a laptop, but I was using my DS fat.

148
00:07:14,191 --> 00:07:15,101
Speaker 1: I thought about bringing a DS.

149
00:07:15,142 --> 00:07:15,830
Speaker 1: It wasn't necessary.

150
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,689
Speaker 1: No, pretty much, like, they have internets there, but it's, like, the court Wi-Fi.

151
00:07:20,951 --> 00:07:23,410
Speaker 1: Like, it's for the whole court, you know, not just for the jury room.

152
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:24,259
Speaker 1: It worked.

153
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:24,849
Speaker 1: It was fast.

154
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:29,926
Speaker 1: There's a message when you sign into it that says, you know, "This internet is completely insecure.

155
00:07:30,107 --> 00:07:30,548
Speaker 1: Good luck with

156
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:30,769
Speaker 1: that.".

157
00:07:31,171 --> 00:07:33,130
Speaker 1: And also, we filtered the porn.

158
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:37,110
Speaker 1: And there were some computers lined up in the back, and there were two tables with chairs.

159
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:47,249
Speaker 1: And the rest of the room, other than that little area with the row of computers and the two tables with four chairs each, was tons and tons of chairs lined up like the DMV.

160
00:07:49,171 --> 00:07:53,169
Speaker 1: And then, you know, flat-screen TVs hanging on the wall so that no matter where you sat, you could see a TV.

161
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,689
Speaker 1: And most of the people didn't do anything and just watched the TV.

162
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:04,230
Speaker 1: There was maybe 10, 20-ish people who were actually doing things.

163
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,606
Speaker 1: Like, there was a girl who was like, "Oh, the TV's so

164
00:08:07,646 --> 00:08:08,029
Speaker 1: annoying.".

165
00:08:08,511 --> 00:08:13,230
Speaker 1: She tried to let her stay in the hallway so she could read in peace.

166
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,670
Speaker 1: There was a businessy lady who was lap-topping.

167
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:18,409
Speaker 1: There were maybe two or three other people lap-topping.

168
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:22,450
Speaker 1: There was a tech-savvy cop, actually, who had jury duty who was pissed.

169
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,188
Speaker 1: He's like, "Ah, they made me leave my gun at home and all this

170
00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:25,450
Speaker 1: bullshit.".

171
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,428
Speaker 1: And he's like, "What the fuck is

172
00:08:28,448 --> 00:08:28,629
Speaker 1: this?".

173
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,192
Speaker 0: Wow, at home?

174
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:37,830
Speaker 0: I remember, actually, when I went to a courthouse in Detroit for unrelated things, they didn't know what to do with my cell phone because that was back when cell phones were bricks.

175
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,690
Speaker 0: And they weren't really sure if I was allowed to bring it in because the rules were all about walkie-talkies.

176
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the rule was, like, no cell phones, right?

177
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,269
Speaker 1: You know, I mean, when we first got in there, people were using them.

178
00:08:49,013 --> 00:08:51,848
Speaker 1: And there was a sign that was like, you know, "Don't use your

179
00:08:51,868 --> 00:08:52,169
Speaker 1: phone.".

180
00:08:52,572 --> 00:08:54,705
Speaker 1: And they kept saying, like, you know, "Everyone turn your phone

181
00:08:54,886 --> 00:08:54,986
Speaker 1: off.".

182
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,567
Speaker 1: You know, "If you need it for emergencies, put it on silent or

183
00:08:58,607 --> 00:08:59,069
Speaker 1: vibrate.".

184
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:05,967
Speaker 1: "If you need to actually use it, which includes texting, emailing, whatever, go outside and then come back in through the metal detectors

185
00:09:06,027 --> 00:09:06,269
Speaker 1: again.".

186
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:11,310
Speaker 1: But laptops and tablets and anything that wasn't a phone was perfectly okay.

187
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:16,970
Speaker 0: So wait a minute, I can't use my portable computer because it's too small and phone-like.

188
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,670
Speaker 1: But I can use my big portable computer that's exactly identical.

189
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,330
Speaker 1: That in fact has more functionality.

190
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,630
Speaker 0: The same communication capabilities and a better camera and microphone built into it.

191
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:26,051
Speaker 0: Yes.

192
00:09:27,376 --> 00:09:34,010
Speaker 1: The thing is, you know, I think the reason for that is, number one, they just don't want you to annoy the people around you, right?

193
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,919
Speaker 0: But I could be just as annoying with my iPad.

194
00:09:36,939 --> 00:09:39,289
Speaker 0: I could hold it up and use it like a phone over their Wi-Fi.

195
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:42,483
Speaker 1: They might come over and ask you to stop.

196
00:09:42,564 --> 00:09:43,189
Speaker 1: No one tried that.

197
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:45,839
Speaker 1: But, you know, they don't want you to be annoying.

198
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,910
Speaker 1: They don't want phones ringing and bothering people.

199
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:53,690
Speaker 1: And I'm sure that once you go to actual court and you're not just in the jury room, that you're not allowed to have dick.

200
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,392
Speaker 0: Oh, of course not.

201
00:09:54,412 --> 00:10:00,455
Speaker 0: Though I would wager, I'll bet there's just some law or some rule that says something vague like, "No cell phones,".

202
00:10:00,515 --> 00:10:03,068
Speaker 0: but yet, you know, "Cell phone no longer means

203
00:10:03,148 --> 00:10:03,490
Speaker 0: anything.".

204
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:03,851
Speaker 1: Yeah.

205
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:12,049
Speaker 1: No, it was just, it was surprised by, like, they had this whole row of computers in the back, like maybe ten of them, and I'm like, "Oh man, this is probably gonna be like waiting to use those and

206
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:12,250
Speaker 1: such.".

207
00:10:13,271 --> 00:10:15,479
Speaker 1: Maybe three of them got used, period, the whole time.

208
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,330
Speaker 1: No one even really bothered with them at all.

209
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:18,890
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

210
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:24,190
Speaker 1: And it just, the vast overwhelming majority of the people there were just sort of doing nothing.

211
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:35,030
Speaker 1: Like, at most, they read, like, the free newspaper, like the AM whatnot, and they just sat there staring and sitting until they were let go or taken somewhere.

212
00:10:35,832 --> 00:10:39,127
Speaker 1: And I was like, "Man, these people, like, didn't even bring books or bring

213
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:39,489
Speaker 1: anything.".

214
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:49,750
Speaker 1: You know, there were, you know, there were people who brought books, but the overwhelming majority, I say, good, like, you know, not just the technology people, subtract, they're talking about the people who did nothing.

215
00:10:49,991 --> 00:10:52,700
Speaker 1: They didn't bring a thing with them, over 60%.

216
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,446
Speaker 1: People brought just nothing.

217
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:55,670
Speaker 1: They were just sitting there.

218
00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:01,090
Speaker 0: Wow, I can, I'm introspective on a regular basis, but I don't just sit there most of the time.

219
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:01,693
Speaker 1: I know.

220
00:11:01,713 --> 00:11:02,946
Speaker 1: I don't get it.

221
00:11:03,691 --> 00:11:04,822
Speaker 0: Anyway, got any news?

222
00:11:04,883 --> 00:11:05,610
Speaker 0: It is Tech Day.

223
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,928
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I guess we, uh, should talk- We missed a bunch of stuff.

224
00:11:09,654 --> 00:11:10,609
Speaker 1: We missed a zillion things.

225
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:15,050
Speaker 1: So the thing I want to talk about the most are these supposed Google glasses, right?

226
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:26,669
Speaker 1: So, supposedly, you know, there's a rumor that Google is going to make, you know, glasses that have little, you know, basically, heads-up display, and they're also an Android device of some kind.

227
00:11:27,972 --> 00:11:30,161
Speaker 1: Uh, we call this "shut up and take my

228
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:30,463
Speaker 1: money."

229
00:11:30,985 --> 00:11:32,150
Speaker 1: That's what they call this, right?

230
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:43,130
Speaker 1: I don't care if it's first-gen, I don't care if it sucks, I don't care if it ruins your eyesight, because my eyesight's perfect, I can afford to lose some, I'll still be better off than RAM, and that's all there is to it.

231
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:47,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess I'm at the point where I've been waiting for this my entire life.

232
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:47,915
Speaker 1: There's like between $250 and $600?

233
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:48,398
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could pay that.

234
00:11:50,831 --> 00:11:54,250
Speaker 1: It'll have 3G or 4G, you'll have to pay monthly, I don't care, I could pay for that.

235
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm pretty much ready to gargoyle it up.

236
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:02,769
Speaker 0: I really, all I want is I want to overlay names over people's heads when I'm walking around, and get basic data about stuff.

237
00:12:03,512 --> 00:12:05,490
Speaker 1: And have a camera that's just always camera-ingled?

238
00:12:05,631 --> 00:12:07,510
Speaker 0: I really want the camera that's always camera-ingled.

239
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:11,350
Speaker 1: They say that, you know, I've read some stuff, and you know, if these rumors are true, right?

240
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:15,948
Speaker 1: For example, it'll make sure that people know when you're photo-ing them, but I'll be like,

241
00:12:16,008 --> 00:12:16,349
Speaker 1: "Yeah!"

242
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:22,729
Speaker 1: Poking that LED out with a pin so fast, cutting the wires on that speaker so no one hears me go...

243
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:29,809
Speaker 0: My old, old cell phone actually had a thing where if you took a picture it would play a sound, and you could change the sound, but you could not disable it.

244
00:12:30,372 --> 00:12:34,790
Speaker 0: So I uploaded an empty WAV file, and that was my sound.

245
00:12:35,993 --> 00:12:37,690
Speaker 0: I also put tape over the little light.

246
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,151
Speaker 1: Yep.

247
00:12:38,817 --> 00:12:40,067
Speaker 1: So, you know...

248
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:47,750
Speaker 0: There's only one camera I own where I want the little light, and that's the GoPro, because it has lights on, like, three surfaces, so I can tell if it's still working.

249
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:51,210
Speaker 1: There's no way to know, because it doesn't have any other information on it if it's working or not.

250
00:12:51,210 --> 00:13:01,988
Speaker 0: But after having seen videos of myself skiing, because I wore, like, the chest mount, I was skiing around with it, I really want there to be... I want to have, like, the last 48 hours of video of my entire life just available all the time.

251
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:03,614
Speaker 1: Why last 48?

252
00:13:03,614 --> 00:13:06,870
Speaker 1: I say last all the hours since I was born.

253
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,550
Speaker 0: The thing is, I'd have to archive all that.

254
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,909
Speaker 1: I also want video of every person that has ever lived throughout all of history, through all time.

255
00:13:16,593 --> 00:13:18,190
Speaker 1: From Caesar to the medieval peasant.

256
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,490
Speaker 0: You'll get to see Cleopatra doing the nasty.

257
00:13:21,072 --> 00:13:22,038
Speaker 1: Oh, shit, son!

258
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,749
Speaker 1: You know how much you can sell that shit for?

259
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,749
Speaker 0: No, zero, because everyone will have that video.

260
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:31,169
Speaker 1: Dude, every porn sci-fi out of business just be watching that shit over and over again.

261
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:32,174
Speaker 1: Oh, you know what?

262
00:13:32,235 --> 00:13:32,679
Speaker 1: Fuck that!

263
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,630
Speaker 1: You know what, Rim?

264
00:13:34,011 --> 00:13:36,650
Speaker 1: You can have all the Cleopatra doing the nasties.

265
00:13:37,091 --> 00:13:38,828
Speaker 1: I'm taking all the Helen of Troy doing the nasties.

266
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:40,209
Speaker 1: That's right.

267
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:44,630
Speaker 0: But I only need the last 48 hours, because the majority of...

268
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:52,667
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, you're never, you know, by the time you watch 48 hours of Cleopatra doing the nasty... I'm sure she did it, you know, combined in her life longer than 48 hours.

269
00:13:53,251 --> 00:13:54,829
Speaker 0: If I've learned one thing from video production...

270
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:57,189
Speaker 1: You can pretty much go back to hour number one and you won't remember it.

271
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:04,710
Speaker 0: It's that every, I don't know, ten hours of video I get makes maybe one minute of interesting content.

272
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:10,530
Speaker 1: I mean, like, you watch Running Man, they filmed that shit for, like, two days and managed to boil it down to, like, a 90-minute show.

273
00:14:10,898 --> 00:14:11,027
Speaker 0: Yup.

274
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,270
Speaker 1: You know, you don't see anything that... they edit out so much crap.

275
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:22,050
Speaker 0: Ah, so I found an article about your jury duty thing on why they allowed cell phones specifically in and why they tell people not to use them.

276
00:14:22,572 --> 00:14:23,776
Speaker 0: They wanted to keep them banned.

277
00:14:23,836 --> 00:14:27,409
Speaker 0: They don't want people to have cell phones only because the cell phones all have cameras in them.

278
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:38,309
Speaker 0: The reason they lifted the ban is because they had to confiscate 400 phones a day during jury duty because every single person who came in had a cell phone or two.

279
00:14:39,715 --> 00:14:40,870
Speaker 1: There was a guy with two iPhones.

280
00:14:42,331 --> 00:14:44,950
Speaker 0: Hey, I used to carry a Blackberry and my phone back in the day.

281
00:14:45,331 --> 00:14:55,430
Speaker 1: So the other thing is, you know, the corollary to this Google Glasses rumor is the slightly less reliable rumor, neither one is super reliable, but anyway, is the Apple Watch.

282
00:14:55,651 --> 00:14:58,849
Speaker 1: And it's like, well, shut up and take my money again.

283
00:14:59,412 --> 00:15:01,130
Speaker 0: Yup, I'll wear the watch and the goggles.

284
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,820
Speaker 1: Right, it's like, dude, there's nothing I want more, right?

285
00:15:03,941 --> 00:15:05,950
Speaker 1: It's like, I don't like watches because they're useless.

286
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,230
Speaker 1: It's like, I'll just look at my phone to see what time it is.

287
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:13,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only time I ever wear a watch is skiing because I don't want to take my expensive cell phone out in the middle of a blizzard.

288
00:15:13,891 --> 00:15:21,490
Speaker 1: Right, but there's already this Android watch that kind of sucks, but it sort of has the features I'm looking for, which is, want to know what time it is?

289
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,433
Speaker 1: Look at the watch.

290
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:24,021
Speaker 1: Well, all watches do that, right?

291
00:15:24,243 --> 00:15:25,690
Speaker 1: But it's like, got an email.

292
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:30,499
Speaker 1: Your phone goes ding and you look at your watch and you see what email it was.

293
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:36,410
Speaker 1: or there's tweets and you just go ding and you look at the watch and all the notifications and all that are on the watch.

294
00:15:36,551 --> 00:15:41,570
Speaker 1: Or, oh, I want to start playing music now, push some buttons on the watch and not have to get the phone out of your pocket.

295
00:15:41,751 --> 00:15:44,101
Speaker 0: Now, people have made things like this for a long time.

296
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:46,210
Speaker 0: They just all really suck.

297
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,449
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the rumor is Apple is making one.

298
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,890
Speaker 1: So Scott, here's the conundrum.

299
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,870
Speaker 1: Which means it'll work so nicely with the iPhone.

300
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:53,719
Speaker 0: Apple will have the nice watch.

301
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,350
Speaker 0: Google will have the nice goggle.

302
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:59,660
Speaker 1: The thing is, from what I can tell based on these rumors, the goggles will go stand alone.

303
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,224
Speaker 1: The watch will work with the iPhone.

304
00:16:01,244 --> 00:16:03,930
Speaker 1: So I'll have an iPhone, an iWatch and Google goggles.

305
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:08,189
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see if there's some sort of droid hackish solution to the watch.

306
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:13,644
Speaker 1: You know, and you know, what are the odds that Apple is going to make the iWatch work with an Android phone?

307
00:16:13,664 --> 00:16:14,025
Speaker 1: Zero.

308
00:16:14,045 --> 00:16:15,790
Speaker 1: The negative a zillion, right?

309
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:21,242
Speaker 1: What are the odds that, you know, Google will make some app for the iPhone that the goggles might communicate with it?

310
00:16:22,425 --> 00:16:24,630
Speaker 1: Better than the odds at reverse, right?

311
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,938
Speaker 1: I mean, greater than zero, maybe 10 percent, 20.

312
00:16:26,938 --> 00:16:28,363
Speaker 1: You know, Google puts all their stuff.

313
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,668
Speaker 1: You have Google Voice and iPhone.

314
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:30,090
Speaker 1: They don't care.

315
00:16:30,691 --> 00:16:31,353
Speaker 1: Right.

316
00:16:31,373 --> 00:16:36,805
Speaker 1: So, you know, the iPhone, iWatch, Google goggles combination is I'm looking forward to it.

317
00:16:36,846 --> 00:16:38,750
Speaker 1: And they say these rumors are like within the year.

318
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:45,210
Speaker 1: And I'm like, oh, the thing is, I'm saving, you know, I'm basically keeping all the monies in the bank account.

319
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:49,950
Speaker 0: There's a lot I could say about this, but we've talked about augmented reality and heads up displays and all that before.

320
00:16:50,090 --> 00:17:03,490
Speaker 0: So instead, I just want to point out again, every time nerds talk about stuff like this, it seems like the majority of the comments are the armchair scientists making, you know, kind of obvious attacks like, oh, you want to play God?

321
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,701
Speaker 0: Now more like, oh, what about people who have prescription problems?

322
00:17:07,721 --> 00:17:08,824
Speaker 0: Like, will it work with that?

323
00:17:09,226 --> 00:17:10,650
Speaker 0: or like, oh, this wouldn't work.

324
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,276
Speaker 1: It's generation one.

325
00:17:12,457 --> 00:17:13,763
Speaker 1: What about blind people?

326
00:17:13,944 --> 00:17:14,990
Speaker 1: No, they basically they don't.

327
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:15,992
Speaker 1: They can't use the watch.

328
00:17:16,012 --> 00:17:17,536
Speaker 0: There's technology.

329
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:32,550
Speaker 0: A lot of people seem to make kind of the obvious arguments against the thing, never having even considered the possibility that the engineers who designed it thought of the same thing that they thought of and might have already come up with a solution to said thing.

330
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,274
Speaker 0: I mean, the prescription problem.

331
00:17:35,056 --> 00:17:36,981
Speaker 0: What's the demographic of Google goggles?

332
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:40,670
Speaker 0: If anything, it'll only work for people who need a prescription to start.

333
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:44,297
Speaker 1: There's probably just going to be an adjustable knob or setting.

334
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:48,450
Speaker 0: But anyway, and much more, I don't want to say sinister news yet.

335
00:17:49,512 --> 00:17:53,370
Speaker 0: We had a big argument in the forum about this, and I forgot we didn't actually talk about it on the show.

336
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:59,650
Speaker 0: But the other big tech news was that with OS 10 Mountain Lion comes an updated gatekeeper.

337
00:18:00,111 --> 00:18:00,592
Speaker 1: We told you.

338
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:02,578
Speaker 1: Well, the new thing, it's called Gatekeeper.

339
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,650
Speaker 1: Gee, we didn't see this coming 100 years ago, except we totally did.

340
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:16,810
Speaker 0: So if you're unaware, Gatekeeper, which will be there by default, will prevent you from installing anything that didn't come certified through the Mac App Store.

341
00:18:17,191 --> 00:18:17,493
Speaker 1: Right.

342
00:18:18,275 --> 00:18:19,480
Speaker 1: It's basically the same as it's.

343
00:18:19,701 --> 00:18:22,110
Speaker 1: it's similar to what Windows does with drivers, right?

344
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:27,270
Speaker 1: If the driver has been signed by Microsoft, which means, you know, like the Nvidia driver is signed by Microsoft, right?

345
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,462
Speaker 1: Microsoft says, yup, that driver is legit.

346
00:18:30,482 --> 00:18:32,350
Speaker 1: So when you install it, it installs nicely.

347
00:18:32,652 --> 00:18:33,680
Speaker 1: But if you go to some shady site.

348
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:41,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, my crazy like ghetto Russian DV, whatever decoder device that needs some weird ass driver.

349
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,082
Speaker 1: Windows pops up this message that's like, whoa, dude, warning.

350
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:45,890
Speaker 1: You're about to install some fucked up shit.

351
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:50,230
Speaker 1: Click yes to install the fucked up shit or push the big no button to stay safe.

352
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,577
Speaker 0: But that click yes is still there.

353
00:18:52,737 --> 00:18:56,549
Speaker 0: And the one thing I can say about Microsoft, love him or hate him, is that that will never go away.

354
00:18:56,952 --> 00:18:59,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least not in the foreseeable future.

355
00:18:59,370 --> 00:18:59,812
Speaker 1: That's right.

356
00:19:00,053 --> 00:19:04,330
Speaker 0: So basically right now, there's still a way around this.

357
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:07,149
Speaker 0: You can turn that off and sell whatever you want on a Mac.

358
00:19:08,572 --> 00:19:09,498
Speaker 0: I will bet you.

359
00:19:09,538 --> 00:19:11,650
Speaker 0: And in fact, I already bet good money.

360
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,438
Speaker 1: Windows is just doing it for drivers.

361
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:15,550
Speaker 1: Apple is doing it for all software.

362
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:20,670
Speaker 1: Anything you want to install, period, will have this yes/no warning thing when you install it.

363
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,858
Speaker 0: I've talked about this before.

364
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:22,764
Speaker 0: We've talked about it.

365
00:19:22,784 --> 00:19:23,630
Speaker 0: We'll talk about it again.

366
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:30,930
Speaker 0: The walled garden, not to be alarmist, not to make a slippery slope argument, just saying it is a very dangerous precedent.

367
00:19:31,552 --> 00:19:37,630
Speaker 0: And it's something you need to be wary of because look at already the walled garden on HDPCs and content online.

368
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:50,030
Speaker 0: Any device that has apps like the Xbox or the Playstation 3 or Boxee now, the apps that are available don't give you the same functionality as just using a regular computer.

369
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,576
Speaker 0: YouTube apps don't show the same content.

370
00:19:52,897 --> 00:19:57,270
Speaker 0: Like straight up, content's invisible on the Xbox that you can see just fine on a web browser.

371
00:19:57,631 --> 00:20:02,870
Speaker 0: Hulu blocks content from phones and from apps that I can just see fine on a web browser.

372
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,588
Speaker 0: They seem to think that I can't plug a normal computer into my TV.

373
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,292
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is the whole thing, right?

374
00:20:10,295 --> 00:20:20,630
Speaker 1: When you have this closed ecosystem where only the approved apps get in, it means that now you can't just write apps that do whatever you want.

375
00:20:21,771 --> 00:20:25,890
Speaker 1: Certain apps with certain features will not be allowed, period.

376
00:20:26,312 --> 00:20:27,680
Speaker 0: Let's see, will they allow a BitTorrent app?

377
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:31,508
Speaker 1: Maybe, maybe not.

378
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,690
Speaker 0: Would they allow a sort of waste-like app?

379
00:20:35,051 --> 00:20:35,949
Speaker 1: Almost definitely not.

380
00:20:36,351 --> 00:20:38,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, would they allow an iTunes competitor?

381
00:20:40,016 --> 00:20:40,389
Speaker 1: Who knows?

382
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:53,175
Speaker 0: We can get around this now, but I've actually bet a reasonable sum of money that within three years of the date we talked about this, which was a few days ago, I think it was last week, Apple's going to remove

383
00:20:53,275 --> 00:20:53,476
Speaker 1: the

384
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:57,169
Speaker 0: option to be able to install stuff that isn't in their app

385
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:57,350
Speaker 1: store.

386
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:04,170
Speaker 1: It's either going to be, what's going to happen is either the next animal or the animal after that in terms of OS X, right?

387
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:14,110
Speaker 1: They're either going to merge OS X and iOS into the same thing, in which case it'll be app store will be the only way to get software onto it without jailbreaking, right?

388
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:26,050
Speaker 1: Or they're still going to have the separation, but OS X is pretty much going to remove that yes button and you'll only be able to install things that Apple wants you to and nothing else.

389
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,473
Speaker 0: So I'm going to go one step further.

390
00:21:27,493 --> 00:21:30,602
Speaker 0: I mean, for one, I think yes, within three years that option will go away.

391
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:33,410
Speaker 0: I think Apple platforms will not allow you to install.

392
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:34,673
Speaker 1: It's funny, I get, you know what else?

393
00:21:34,713 --> 00:21:35,776
Speaker 1: I get another prediction, right?

394
00:21:36,037 --> 00:21:40,910
Speaker 1: You notice how the Apple fanboys, they're like, well, it's still okay because you can still click yes, right?

395
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:43,657
Speaker 1: They're like, and they're like, oh, Apple would never remove that yes.

396
00:21:44,139 --> 00:21:45,884
Speaker 1: But then you'll see when they do remove the.

397
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:48,230
Speaker 1: yes, the Apple fanboys are going to be like, oh, it's better that way.

398
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,574
Speaker 1: Your computer is totally safe.

399
00:21:49,634 --> 00:21:53,970
Speaker 1: You know, it's not like the, you know, it's like they'll keep shifting their position to whatever Apple does.

400
00:21:54,411 --> 00:21:58,198
Speaker 0: In some ways it could be better on certain kinds of platforms.

401
00:21:58,218 --> 00:22:04,690
Speaker 0: Like it doesn't bother me nearly as much on the iPhone because the phone is a more purpose built device and I have alternatives.

402
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:06,272
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's weird.

403
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:17,130
Speaker 1: Like people jailbreak their phone and I don't just, you know, because I want my phone to work and I don't want to have to fiddle around with it or futz with it or if it fails or that would suck balls, you know.

404
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:21,200
Speaker 1: But I do still feel in principle that I should be able to install whatever I want in there.

405
00:22:22,162 --> 00:22:25,230
Speaker 1: But I'm willing to give that up for the phone that actually works.

406
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:30,322
Speaker 1: And the thing is, all those things that I could do by jailbreaking, I just really don't want to do.

407
00:22:30,402 --> 00:22:33,790
Speaker 1: If I did want to do them, well, I jailbreak or get an Android phone or who knows what.

408
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:34,898
Speaker 1: But a computer is different.

409
00:22:34,918 --> 00:22:36,650
Speaker 1: But I just don't want to do those things.

410
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:43,479
Speaker 0: Now, I mean, there is a place for application like computing devices, like certain kinds of tablets and Xboxes and things.

411
00:22:43,539 --> 00:22:45,241
Speaker 0: And that doesn't really bother me.

412
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:52,110
Speaker 0: What bothers me is that the computer itself at its fundamental core is a general purpose device in the hands of the person who's using it.

413
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:55,817
Speaker 0: If you don't have full control over it, it's a different kind of device.

414
00:22:56,979 --> 00:23:02,670
Speaker 0: And I don't think Apple is actually going to continue to sell computers in the long run.

415
00:23:02,992 --> 00:23:06,110
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, they're going to straight up drop the idea of a Mac.

416
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:11,664
Speaker 1: Well, they still need to have something for people to create the software, you know, to make apps on.

417
00:23:11,684 --> 00:23:14,170
Speaker 1: You won't be able to make an iPad app on an iPad.

418
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:14,484
Speaker 1: Yeah.

419
00:23:15,031 --> 00:23:21,010
Speaker 1: But, you know, I mean, maybe they'll have Xcode for iPad with, you know, and attach the keyboard to it kind of situation.

420
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:26,030
Speaker 0: No, I think instead in the long run, they'll probably have a Windows and or Linux application to do that.

421
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:29,370
Speaker 1: They might get rid of like the non, you know, I don't know what they'll do.

422
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:35,050
Speaker 0: Or they could sell a dedicated, they could sell Macs that are designed specifically to develop on other Apple stuff with a bunch of hardware.

423
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, they could have like the Pro only.

424
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:37,890
Speaker 0: Yeah.

425
00:23:38,352 --> 00:23:44,030
Speaker 0: But I honestly, because look at the money they make, all the money Apple makes is in these purpose built devices.

426
00:23:45,531 --> 00:23:47,899
Speaker 0: And already, I mean, what do people use Macs for?

427
00:23:47,979 --> 00:23:51,630
Speaker 0: It's a lot of the kind of creative stuff that Windows has equal offerings on.

428
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:58,030
Speaker 0: And some of the big players there like Adobe seems to be trying to drop Apple support as much as humanly possible.

429
00:23:58,331 --> 00:24:03,929
Speaker 1: And the only creative stuff really that Apple has left that no one else has is what Final Cut and Pro Tools.

430
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:04,090
Speaker 1: Right.

431
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,469
Speaker 1: Those are pretty much the two big ones.

432
00:24:06,032 --> 00:24:08,843
Speaker 0: And honestly, as an audio engineer, I really don't like Pro Tools.

433
00:24:08,883 --> 00:24:09,666
Speaker 0: I've used it a lot.

434
00:24:09,687 --> 00:24:10,530
Speaker 0: I've used it in studios.

435
00:24:10,872 --> 00:24:14,330
Speaker 0: And I find it relatively inferior to other offerings.

436
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:18,770
Speaker 0: Now, I can't say Final Cut Pro because I kind of wish I could use Final Cut Pro fucking Premiere.

437
00:24:20,754 --> 00:24:25,850
Speaker 1: But, you know, you can't have this whole hardware platform just for Final Cut.

438
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:37,210
Speaker 0: Especially considering that while Apple laptops are selling pretty well, I think that the iPad and the equivalent are doing a huge dent into MacBook sales.

439
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:41,910
Speaker 0: And I think that the desktop Apple PC will disappear within five years.

440
00:24:42,433 --> 00:24:45,470
Speaker 0: And I think the Apple laptop will disappear within 10, if not sooner.

441
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:50,830
Speaker 0: I think they'll all be replaced by various app driven things like the iPad.

442
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,035
Speaker 1: Well, definitely the consumer market, right?

443
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:59,170
Speaker 1: There's going to be a lot less laptoping and a lot more, you know, tableting and, you know, phoning.

444
00:24:59,651 --> 00:25:07,270
Speaker 1: I mean, look at how many people, you know, I mean, even just, you know, three or four years ago in that jury room, you would have seen a lot more laptops.

445
00:25:07,511 --> 00:25:10,700
Speaker 1: But now a lot of the people, you know, they weren't un-technological.

446
00:25:10,781 --> 00:25:13,007
Speaker 1: They were just cell phone, tablet only.

447
00:25:13,268 --> 00:25:13,830
Speaker 1: No laptop.

448
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,030
Speaker 0: I used to carry my laptop everywhere.

449
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:22,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only people who were really laptoping was me, the developer, and this one really businessy lady.

450
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,213
Speaker 1: And that was pretty much it.

451
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:27,460
Speaker 1: The other, you know, most of the other people were non-laptopping.

452
00:25:27,601 --> 00:25:31,510
Speaker 1: for, you know, maybe I think two people whipped some out for like five minutes and then put them away.

453
00:25:31,832 --> 00:25:32,184
Speaker 1: And that was it.

454
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:36,510
Speaker 0: Now, I'm not saying this is the end of general purpose computing because, you know, we have other options.

455
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:53,710
Speaker 0: I just think Apple is going to go for this demographic and thus to make public my bet on February 16th, 2015, if Apple has not removed the option from the OS to disable the gatekeeper and let you install your own stuff, then I get a hundred bucks.

456
00:25:54,650 --> 00:26:11,370
Speaker 1: The other thing to consider here, right, is like the business aspect of this, right, is like you make some software, you know, and Apple, you know, the OS X has this, you know, different culture than Windows and Linux where people on Macs for some reason, even if it's not in an app store, they buy software.

457
00:26:12,132 --> 00:26:15,524
Speaker 1: Like everyone at work on all these Mac users are like paying for text editors.

458
00:26:15,545 --> 00:26:16,608
Speaker 1: I'm like, what the fuck is wrong with you?

459
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:17,010
Speaker 1: Right.

460
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:20,282
Speaker 1: You know, it's like that's just what they do.

461
00:26:20,362 --> 00:26:22,230
Speaker 1: is Mac people pay for software.

462
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:26,750
Speaker 0: Well, because Apple has a very, you know, with they push this app store and it's almost like.

463
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:32,830
Speaker 1: But I mean, just like independent Apple, you know, software developers who make software for the Mac, like try to sell it.

464
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:37,410
Speaker 0: Now, I'm not saying it's premeditated and there's only one fuck of a conspiracy, but and it's not.

465
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:45,650
Speaker 0: But I think it just kind of worked out this way that look, they've got a culture of people who are used to that, which might have been due to the physical design of how you install stuff.

466
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:48,330
Speaker 0: You know, you drag the icon out of the DMG or whatever.

467
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,489
Speaker 0: It feels like you're taking like this monolithic app and kind of putting it there.

468
00:26:52,210 --> 00:27:03,870
Speaker 0: But Apple, by then monetizing this with their own app store, basically it stands to make money for all the development that other people do to plug holes in their system.

469
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,950
Speaker 0: For example, Macs don't really support game pads for crap.

470
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,876
Speaker 0: So you have to buy an app to make that work.

471
00:27:09,358 --> 00:27:12,670
Speaker 0: The idea of doing that on a Windows PC or a Linux PC is laughable.

472
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:13,332
Speaker 1: Right.

473
00:27:13,393 --> 00:27:14,430
Speaker 1: It's just, of course they work.

474
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,884
Speaker 0: That's basic functionality.

475
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:16,470
Speaker 0: It just works.

476
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:22,009
Speaker 0: You plug any input device into a Windows PC, it detects it as something and you can use it.

477
00:27:22,473 --> 00:27:22,830
Speaker 1: That's right.

478
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:27,930
Speaker 0: Granted, PC gamers are starting to go down that road with their stupid Joy to Key.

479
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:28,391
Speaker 1: Right.

480
00:27:28,411 --> 00:27:31,370
Speaker 1: But Joy to Key, at least shady as it is, is free.

481
00:27:31,714 --> 00:27:31,777
Speaker 1: Yep.

482
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:33,302
Speaker 1: It's not something you pay for.

483
00:27:33,363 --> 00:27:33,545
Speaker 1: Right.

484
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:41,150
Speaker 1: So but it's weird because like now you're going to get, you know, all these companies that do make, you know, for pay Mac apps.

485
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:43,495
Speaker 1: A lot of them are going to get shut out.

486
00:27:43,515 --> 00:27:49,830
Speaker 1: because right now, imagine you go to a site and you download some shady software for free and you try to install it.

487
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:51,864
Speaker 1: And it says, warning, this isn't legit.

488
00:27:51,905 --> 00:27:52,529
Speaker 1: And you click OK.

489
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:53,993
Speaker 1: Well, that's sort of what you expect.

490
00:27:54,334 --> 00:28:00,430
Speaker 1: Imagine you go to a site and you know, for adium or which is free, but you know, something else that you maybe pay 10 bucks for.

491
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,098
Speaker 1: You pay 10 bucks for this text editor.

492
00:28:02,118 --> 00:28:03,104
Speaker 1: That's totally legit.

493
00:28:03,124 --> 00:28:04,170
Speaker 1: But it wasn't in the app store.

494
00:28:04,931 --> 00:28:07,909
Speaker 1: And then you try to install it on your Mac and it's like warning.

495
00:28:08,612 --> 00:28:09,997
Speaker 1: And you're like, what?

496
00:28:10,077 --> 00:28:11,181
Speaker 1: This is a legit app.

497
00:28:11,241 --> 00:28:12,546
Speaker 1: I just paid 10 bucks for.

498
00:28:12,626 --> 00:28:13,810
Speaker 1: Did I just get ripped off?

499
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:24,690
Speaker 1: You know, even with the yes, no, still as available choices, suddenly it looks really bad for those four pay, you know, independent Mac software developers.

500
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:29,910
Speaker 1: But at the same time and it's like, yes, no dialog box looks really scary.

501
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,694
Speaker 0: At the same time, it helps them out.

502
00:28:31,854 --> 00:28:34,240
Speaker 0: If they buy into the Apple stuff, they become legit.

503
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:37,890
Speaker 1: They go through Apple's chat and then Apple takes a huge cut of the money.

504
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:38,573
Speaker 0: That big of a cut.

505
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:41,890
Speaker 0: And also Apple doesn't take anything with a lock.

506
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:43,173
Speaker 1: You make Windows software.

507
00:28:43,353 --> 00:28:49,850
Speaker 0: Apple provides a much a pretty consistent DRM platform and everything they need to make their money.

508
00:28:50,571 --> 00:28:51,693
Speaker 1: They're also right.

509
00:28:51,894 --> 00:28:59,550
Speaker 1: What part of this is, is that there's going to be some APIs in OS X that you won't be able to access at all unless you're an approved app.

510
00:29:00,011 --> 00:29:07,750
Speaker 1: So if you want like, you know, certain thing to do certain things in the system, well, only apps that are in the app store can do those things.

511
00:29:08,411 --> 00:29:09,654
Speaker 1: And you're free.

512
00:29:09,834 --> 00:29:16,190
Speaker 1: Your app that was downloaded from an independent place on the Internet, no matter how legitimate it is, can't do those things.

513
00:29:16,711 --> 00:29:21,967
Speaker 1: So it's like, oh, you want to make software that, for example, accesses the printing.

514
00:29:21,987 --> 00:29:23,030
Speaker 1: I'm just making something up here.

515
00:29:24,211 --> 00:29:24,872
Speaker 1: Oh, no, no.

516
00:29:24,952 --> 00:29:26,996
Speaker 1: Only programs that are in the app store can print.

517
00:29:27,497 --> 00:29:28,338
Speaker 1: All the other ones can't.

518
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:31,664
Speaker 1: They just printing won't work unless, you know, it's like.

519
00:29:32,265 --> 00:29:35,090
Speaker 1: then it's like forcing people to go into the app store.

520
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:41,790
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter if the yes is there because no app that's, you know, even worth the shit will be available even with the yes.

521
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:42,672
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, great.

522
00:29:42,712 --> 00:29:47,470
Speaker 1: I click yes to install my word processor that Apple doesn't like and it can't print.

523
00:29:47,971 --> 00:29:53,905
Speaker 0: So if you disagree that this will happen, one, Apple has a long history of doing this sort of thing.

524
00:29:53,965 --> 00:29:55,930
Speaker 0: There's precedent in both the iPhone and the iPad.

525
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:56,630
Speaker 1: Yeah.

526
00:29:56,650 --> 00:30:04,710
Speaker 1: I don't know why, though, like you think like, you know, Steve Jobs, you know, dying and whatever, the people who are still at Apple also believe in this.

527
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:07,280
Speaker 1: It's like there has to be in Apple's giant company.

528
00:30:07,301 --> 00:30:09,410
Speaker 1: There have to be people who don't believe in this somewhere.

529
00:30:10,491 --> 00:30:10,833
Speaker 1: Right.

530
00:30:10,853 --> 00:30:12,519
Speaker 1: These are technologically intelligent people.

531
00:30:12,639 --> 00:30:15,390
Speaker 1: All of them really like these idea, you know.

532
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:27,390
Speaker 0: Well, Scott, remember, you're thinking about this from a philosophical and a user experience perspective where a corporation, you think about it from the aspect that this directly will make Apple more money both now and in the long run.

533
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:34,210
Speaker 0: I think for the company, it's a great idea, even though I think for me and for a lot of users, it's a terrible idea to make more money.

534
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:38,810
Speaker 1: But it's like, you know, the people who work there are like going along with this, making more money.

535
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:39,913
Speaker 1: They have, you know, at least.

536
00:30:39,974 --> 00:30:45,270
Speaker 1: the one thing I noticed, though, that was recent news of Apple is that, you know, Apple has tons of cash.

537
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:48,398
Speaker 1: I'm not talking about just, you know, of course, every company has a lot of money.

538
00:30:48,458 --> 00:30:48,618
Speaker 1: Right.

539
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:52,850
Speaker 1: But Apple has a lot of cash, as in plain old paper dollars sitting in the bank.

540
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:53,633
Speaker 0: So does Google.

541
00:30:53,834 --> 00:30:57,590
Speaker 0: Either one of these companies could do something crazy like buy the entire recording industry.

542
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:01,679
Speaker 1: Apple has ludicrous billions and billions of dollars just in cash sitting there.

543
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:05,569
Speaker 1: They could just give the money to all the employees and everyone call it a day and go home, which is what I would do.

544
00:31:07,271 --> 00:31:08,373
Speaker 1: But so they have all this cash.

545
00:31:08,674 --> 00:31:15,390
Speaker 1: And the reason they have so much cash is that Steve Jobs actually, you know, from his experience in the olden days, getting screwed over.

546
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:16,231
Speaker 1: Right.

547
00:31:16,251 --> 00:31:23,230
Speaker 1: Was like, you can never have too much cash because what if suddenly the whole world changes and you need to catch up and you're getting screwed?

548
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:29,410
Speaker 1: You might need to like build a new factory tomorrow that does this, that builds a certain thing or, you know, who knows what, you know, you never know.

549
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:30,051
Speaker 1: It can't hurt.

550
00:31:30,452 --> 00:31:31,855
Speaker 1: So he loved to have tons of cash.

551
00:31:32,417 --> 00:31:38,210
Speaker 1: And the people at Apple now is big news that one of them actually said, yeah, I think we have too much cash.

552
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,655
Speaker 1: We need to spend some of it.

553
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,430
Speaker 1: But I like I wonder what they're going to, you know, it's like, well, you have too much cash.

554
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:44,514
Speaker 1: You need to spend some of it.

555
00:31:45,096 --> 00:31:48,950
Speaker 1: Maybe you could lower your margins on your on your overpriced crap.

556
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:54,950
Speaker 0: But to Apple straight up, I mean, they'll make money doing this by by being the only legitimate channel to sell apps.

557
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:58,361
Speaker 0: They can make money off of the so-called shareware market.

558
00:31:58,702 --> 00:32:01,050
Speaker 0: They're basically there's an existing app market in Apple.

559
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:05,365
Speaker 0: They're just going to take the whole thing over, play by their ball or you don't get any money.

560
00:32:05,385 --> 00:32:06,730
Speaker 0: You have no access to their platform.

561
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:15,090
Speaker 0: And they work pretty heavily with the media producers who themselves and the distributors really, really want apps.

562
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,117
Speaker 0: They really want to be able to lock everything down.

563
00:32:17,157 --> 00:32:20,570
Speaker 0: I mean, a YouTube app, you can't just block the ads.

564
00:32:21,671 --> 00:32:28,810
Speaker 0: A CollegeHumor app, you can only show the things that are originals and make the money from your content without having to do content sharing deals or anything.

565
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:31,769
Speaker 0: You can prevent people from seeing stuff that isn't profitable to you.

566
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:35,319
Speaker 0: So I think it's going to happen.

567
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,210
Speaker 0: I bet money on it and we'll see.

568
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:45,390
Speaker 1: That's why, you know, I guess, you know, people, you know, only the open source cool people have really appreciated the fact that, you know, thank God Linux exists.

569
00:32:46,613 --> 00:32:46,793
Speaker 1: Right.

570
00:32:46,813 --> 00:32:50,269
Speaker 1: But, you know, we've appreciated it since, you know, decades ago.

571
00:32:51,593 --> 00:32:52,810
Speaker 1: Give it five, ten years.

572
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:54,649
Speaker 0: The day I became afraid of it.

573
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,618
Speaker 1: You'll see a lot of people who'll be really happy.

574
00:32:57,638 --> 00:33:01,110
Speaker 1: They'll be like, oh, man, am I glad that Linux thing exists.

575
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,710
Speaker 1: Why did I make fun of all those neckbeards for all these years?

576
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,429
Speaker 0: Maybe it's just because.

577
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:06,693
Speaker 0: I've got no choice.

578
00:33:06,733 --> 00:33:11,910
Speaker 1: because if I use Windows or OS X, you can't even, there's no video.

579
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:14,601
Speaker 1: You can't install a video player to watch any kind of video.

580
00:33:14,621 --> 00:33:16,990
Speaker 1: But the thing is, this happened before.

581
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:21,630
Speaker 0: Remember, back in the day, you know, your parents would come and say, hey, how come I can't do X?

582
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,943
Speaker 0: You'd install some software that they didn't know about.

583
00:33:23,963 --> 00:33:25,070
Speaker 0: that let them do stuff.

584
00:33:25,451 --> 00:33:28,970
Speaker 0: Usually that X was how do I pirate movies like I see everybody doing?

585
00:33:30,031 --> 00:33:30,895
Speaker 0: So it'll be the same thing.

586
00:33:30,935 --> 00:33:34,530
Speaker 0: Grandma will come to the nerd and ask, why can't I install my whatever?

587
00:33:34,732 --> 00:33:36,626
Speaker 0: And the nerd will say, oh, here and unclick it.

588
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:37,109
Speaker 0: It'll be good.

589
00:33:37,651 --> 00:33:42,023
Speaker 0: And then when that goes away, grandma might say, fuck it and go to Linux.

590
00:33:42,825 --> 00:33:44,570
Speaker 0: Probably not, but some grandma as well.

591
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:50,527
Speaker 1: No, I think, you know, they'll just be sort of, you know, the the app, the closed app world will just be.

592
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,430
Speaker 1: it'll just work.

593
00:33:52,031 --> 00:34:02,610
Speaker 1: And it'll have enough content that the people who don't want to pull and they just don't mind being pushed on won't even care and won't even want for anything else.

594
00:34:02,951 --> 00:34:05,102
Speaker 1: And but all the smart people will use something else.

595
00:34:05,122 --> 00:34:06,650
Speaker 1: So then it likes to be kind of nice.

596
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,177
Speaker 1: It'll be sort of like reverse hash Wednesday.

597
00:34:08,197 --> 00:34:10,770
Speaker 1: You just be like, oh, yep, there's someone using.

598
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:11,351
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

599
00:34:11,391 --> 00:34:12,518
Speaker 1: Hey, that guy's using Windows.

600
00:34:12,538 --> 00:34:13,261
Speaker 1: That's a smart person.

601
00:34:13,723 --> 00:34:15,070
Speaker 1: You know, let's get together guys.

602
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:18,458
Speaker 1: It's kind of just like but it'll also be easier.

603
00:34:18,518 --> 00:34:22,230
Speaker 1: It'll also be easy for the government to just be like, oh, there's a dude running Linux.

604
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:28,710
Speaker 0: Think of the old Spencer's who grew up doing during the Great Depression and they hoard money like under their mattress because they were burned before.

605
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:30,248
Speaker 0: I guess Steve Jobs is kind of doing that.

606
00:34:31,011 --> 00:34:38,090
Speaker 0: Maybe it's just because you're up during the early days of the Internet with the, you know, the modern Internet, with the EFF Blue Ribbon campaign and the CBDTPA.

607
00:34:38,591 --> 00:34:44,790
Speaker 0: And there have been so many assaults on our basic right to use our computers that were kind of extra paranoid.

608
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:51,550
Speaker 0: I mean, Oracle and Allison and all these people, there is a long history of people trying to actually straight up make it illegal to have a general purpose computing.

609
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:56,967
Speaker 1: That's right, because as pessimistic as I am about five, 10 years out, I'm actually pretty optimistic about 20, 30 years out.

610
00:34:57,891 --> 00:34:59,164
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have my Google goggles.

611
00:34:59,386 --> 00:34:59,710
Speaker 1: That's right.

612
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:00,271
Speaker 1: Yeah.

613
00:35:06,744 --> 00:35:09,470
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

614
00:35:10,051 --> 00:35:11,270
Speaker 1: I had a hard time finding things of the day.

615
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,990
Speaker 0: I have so many things of the day queued up, it's ridiculous.

616
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,249
Speaker 1: You want to send some this way?

617
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:17,749
Speaker 0: I mean, I got a couple, but I'm going to use this one.

618
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:31,410
Speaker 0: So there is a huge nerd debate that's been going on for a long time now because you might all recall that when you were a kid and your parents showed you Star Wars, you really, really, really wanted more of it.

619
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:32,335
Speaker 0: And there wasn't any more.

620
00:35:32,355 --> 00:35:34,889
Speaker 1: That's sort of like how you detect the nerdy kid.

621
00:35:35,451 --> 00:35:39,610
Speaker 0: And then one day you saw on the news that they were making the three prequels.

622
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:43,910
Speaker 0: I think I was more excited about that than I'd been about most things I'd ever been excited about my entire life.

623
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:46,490
Speaker 1: Thing is, like, I wasn't actually that excited.

624
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:54,530
Speaker 1: I mean, I still waited in a big long line to buy a ticket on the right day and every, you know, but it wasn't like, you know, going crazy.

625
00:35:54,991 --> 00:35:58,970
Speaker 0: Well, you never go crazy about anything except Korean variety shows.

626
00:35:59,071 --> 00:36:00,510
Speaker 0: But anyway, and ponies.

627
00:36:01,971 --> 00:36:08,210
Speaker 0: So as we all know, episode one was pretty shit and two and three were kind of better.

628
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:10,390
Speaker 0: But we had this problem now.

629
00:36:10,691 --> 00:36:11,350
Speaker 1: Better than shit.

630
00:36:12,311 --> 00:36:14,590
Speaker 0: More people continue to be born.

631
00:36:15,512 --> 00:36:17,990
Speaker 0: Those people have not already seen Star Wars.

632
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:21,259
Speaker 0: And in fact, if you scoff at this idea, go to an anime con.

633
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:25,130
Speaker 0: because years ago, like four years ago, we were in an anime con.

634
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,950
Speaker 0: There were like five, six hundred people in the audience.

635
00:36:27,313 --> 00:36:29,370
Speaker 0: And we asked how many people hadn't seen Cowboy Bebop.

636
00:36:29,712 --> 00:36:31,210
Speaker 0: And like half the audience raises their hand.

637
00:36:31,532 --> 00:36:32,940
Speaker 0: And the rest of the audience was like, "What?

638
00:36:33,141 --> 00:36:33,524
Speaker 0: What the

639
00:36:33,584 --> 00:36:33,805
Speaker 0: fuck?".

640
00:36:34,731 --> 00:36:36,620
Speaker 0: So Scott says, "Are you kidding?

641
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,308
Speaker 0: Who here has never seen Star

642
00:36:38,328 --> 00:36:38,630
Speaker 0: Wars?".

643
00:36:38,872 --> 00:36:40,669
Speaker 0: And almost half the audience raised their hands.

644
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:44,890
Speaker 1: It wasn't almost half, but it was a scarily large number of people.

645
00:36:45,131 --> 00:36:45,337
Speaker 1: Do it.

646
00:36:45,357 --> 00:36:45,666
Speaker 1: You'll see.

647
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:50,090
Speaker 1: A scarily large percentage of the population has never seen any Star Wars.

648
00:36:50,411 --> 00:36:58,330
Speaker 1: Like you would think every single human being in a civilized place in the world who is above the age of zero has seen it, right?

649
00:36:58,891 --> 00:36:59,115
Speaker 1: Nope.

650
00:36:59,400 --> 00:36:59,950
Speaker 1: Not the case.

651
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:03,645
Speaker 0: Now in the old days, the answer would be, "Alright, let's watch Star

652
00:37:03,685 --> 00:37:03,826
Speaker 0: Wars.".

653
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:11,668
Speaker 0: Now the answer is, "Well, there are six Star Wars movies in two different

654
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:12,230
Speaker 0: orders.".

655
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:16,170
Speaker 1: Well just watch four, five, six and just pretend one, two, three don't exist entirely.

656
00:37:16,591 --> 00:37:18,356
Speaker 0: Ah, but what if you want to watch them?

657
00:37:18,456 --> 00:37:18,837
Speaker 0: or what?

658
00:37:19,057 --> 00:37:23,669
Speaker 0: if you want, you know, they're gonna ask, you know, a kid's gonna ask, "Aren't there three more Star Wars

659
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:23,930
Speaker 0: movies?".

660
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,010
Speaker 0: And you can't hide that from them forever.

661
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:28,630
Speaker 1: Well, it's like once you've seen four, five, six, you have the proper context and knowledge.

662
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:31,870
Speaker 1: You can just watch one, two, three whenever and take them for what they're worth.

663
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:39,310
Speaker 0: Scott, it was like when I was a kid and I got Final Fantasy I, Final Fantasy II, Final Fantasy III, and then there was Final Fantasy VII.

664
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:40,052
Speaker 0: I was like, "What?

665
00:37:40,775 --> 00:37:41,397
Speaker 1: The fuck?

666
00:37:42,421 --> 00:37:44,609
Speaker 0: What's going on over there in

667
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:44,950
Speaker 0: Japan?".

668
00:37:45,051 --> 00:37:47,129
Speaker 0: And then I found this whole magical mystery land.

669
00:37:48,451 --> 00:37:53,250
Speaker 0: So there are many nerd arguments as to what the best order is to show people.

670
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,302
Speaker 0: And, you know, there are valid points to be made.

671
00:37:56,322 --> 00:37:57,670
Speaker 0: This is a pretty good argument to have.

672
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:00,590
Speaker 0: It'll really test your chops on, you know, like film narrative and everything.

673
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:03,427
Speaker 0: Because, for example, you might think, "Oh, just watch them chronologically,

674
00:38:03,487 --> 00:38:03,748
Speaker 0: duh.".

675
00:38:04,137 --> 00:38:04,328
Speaker 1: No.

676
00:38:04,611 --> 00:38:10,790
Speaker 0: That spoils, you know, episodes five, the big cliffhanger and the big, like, "Oh my god, he's my father" thing.

677
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:16,590
Speaker 0: Really loses his punch if you've got three movies beating it into your head, though, and then it just comes to this later.

678
00:38:17,812 --> 00:38:17,858
Speaker 0: Eh.

679
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:18,438
Speaker 0: Yeah.

680
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:20,830
Speaker 1: But, I mean, the thing is, right?

681
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:22,010
Speaker 1: If you watch four, five, six.

682
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:24,030
Speaker 1: The thing is, I still don't believe in spoilers, right?

683
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:27,468
Speaker 1: I mean, I can watch episode five now and he's like, "I am your

684
00:38:27,488 --> 00:38:27,729
Speaker 1: father.".

685
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:28,639
Speaker 1: Works every time.

686
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:29,670
Speaker 1: Doesn't matter that I know.

687
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,102
Speaker 1: In fact, it works better.

688
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:31,709
Speaker 1: that I do know.

689
00:38:32,534 --> 00:38:33,890
Speaker 1: So, I don't really buy that.

690
00:38:34,501 --> 00:38:34,909
Speaker 0: I buy it.

691
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:35,780
Speaker 1: It doesn't work on you?

692
00:38:35,801 --> 00:38:36,490
Speaker 1: Is that what you're saying?

693
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:40,790
Speaker 0: No, I'm saying that certain moments, like, in Cowboy Bebop, there's a death that comes out of nowhere.

694
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:42,370
Speaker 0: And it's kind of a pointless death.

695
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:43,689
Speaker 1: Still works every time.

696
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:46,249
Speaker 1: I think it works better if you don't see it coming because you're not prepared for it.

697
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:50,030
Speaker 1: In fact, it worked better the most recent time I've watched it than it did the first time.

698
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,810
Speaker 0: I don't think you're able to make that judgment.

699
00:38:52,311 --> 00:38:54,869
Speaker 0: Because you can't fully know the state of mind you were in the previous time.

700
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:56,810
Speaker 1: Uh, based on memory.

701
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:57,375
Speaker 0: Yeah.

702
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:58,529
Speaker 0: Memory.

703
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,109
Speaker 0: Who are the water bearers?

704
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:01,709
Speaker 1: Uh, Vindara?

705
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,370
Speaker 0: What happens when they spill their water?

706
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:05,888
Speaker 1: They wet their pants.

707
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:08,809
Speaker 0: So, there are many arguments back and forth.

708
00:39:09,751 --> 00:39:15,630
Speaker 0: And someone introduced perhaps the best recommendation I've ever seen.

709
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,229
Speaker 0: And it is extremely well-reasoned.

710
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:24,150
Speaker 0: And furthermore, he has experimental data because he found an adult who had not seen any Star Wars and tried this order on them.

711
00:39:24,857 --> 00:39:25,450
Speaker 0: And it worked well.

712
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,450
Speaker 0: The order is, and I'll go through this very specifically.

713
00:39:28,631 --> 00:39:34,910
Speaker 0: And I won't talk about why because you can read his long, detailed, excruciatingly well-put-together description.

714
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:37,128
Speaker 0: You watch episode four.

715
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:38,889
Speaker 0: Then episode five.

716
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:40,244
Speaker 0: Then two.

717
00:39:41,571 --> 00:39:42,409
Speaker 0: Then three.

718
00:39:43,494 --> 00:39:43,821
Speaker 0: Then six.

719
00:39:44,571 --> 00:39:45,443
Speaker 0: And if you say, "What about

720
00:39:45,605 --> 00:39:45,687
Speaker 0: one?"

721
00:39:46,033 --> 00:39:46,529
Speaker 0: Fuck one.

722
00:39:46,853 --> 00:39:47,890
Speaker 0: It's the machete order.

723
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,409
Speaker 0: You don't watch episode one.

724
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:52,790
Speaker 1: Well, he also says you could watch one way later if you really wanted to.

725
00:39:53,531 --> 00:39:57,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, you gotta watch one, like, on your deathbed just to remind yourself that we live in a cruel and uncaring world.

726
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:58,956
Speaker 1: I mean, I read this thing.

727
00:39:59,117 --> 00:40:00,827
Speaker 1: Guy's got good logic, right?

728
00:40:00,968 --> 00:40:01,370
Speaker 1: And such.

729
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:03,963
Speaker 1: But, you know, he's got the good ideas.

730
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:09,250
Speaker 0: But he makes a really good point that episode one is not tied to the rest of the movies at all.

731
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:09,855
Speaker 1: He did, right?

732
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:11,129
Speaker 1: He does make really good points.

733
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:19,990
Speaker 1: But, the thing is, I still stand with something that people just aren't getting, which is that, like, look, you've seen them all, right?

734
00:40:20,274 --> 00:40:20,928
Speaker 1: I've seen them all.

735
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,442
Speaker 1: And we sort of have this context.

736
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:23,470
Speaker 1: We understand, right?

737
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:25,270
Speaker 1: This is good, this is bad, whatever, right?

738
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:31,930
Speaker 1: And you think that someone who hasn't seen them before isn't going to reach the point that we are at and understanding and putting the movies in context?

739
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,408
Speaker 0: My experience has been that many people don't.

740
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:34,431
Speaker 1: I don't know.

741
00:40:34,492 --> 00:40:38,810
Speaker 1: I think that if you watch the movies, you'll come to understand them as we understand them.

742
00:40:39,031 --> 00:40:40,569
Speaker 1: So, just watch four, five, six.

743
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:44,570
Speaker 1: And then later, if you want, watch one, two, three, whatever.

744
00:40:45,471 --> 00:40:51,029
Speaker 1: And you'll come to the same understanding of those six movies that all of us have, and it doesn't really matter.

745
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:52,850
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

746
00:40:53,031 --> 00:40:55,182
Speaker 1: I make this argument to everything.

747
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:56,307
Speaker 1: What else do I make this argument to?

748
00:40:56,991 --> 00:40:57,890
Speaker 0: The point I'm making is that...

749
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:58,675
Speaker 1: Oh, wait, wait, wait.

750
00:40:58,755 --> 00:40:59,600
Speaker 1: I'm playing the rim game.

751
00:40:59,661 --> 00:41:01,029
Speaker 1: What else do I make this argument to?

752
00:41:01,511 --> 00:41:01,882
Speaker 0: Pretty much...

753
00:41:02,453 --> 00:41:03,849
Speaker 1: Not name a specific instance.

754
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:13,948
Speaker 0: So, for our listeners, outside of the context of Geek Nights, pretty much any show idea, anything we ever talk about, Scott's answer is, "Hey, who cares?

755
00:41:13,968 --> 00:41:14,529
Speaker 0: Eh, do

756
00:41:14,569 --> 00:41:14,850
Speaker 0: whatever.".

757
00:41:15,711 --> 00:41:16,690
Speaker 1: You need to still have a specific instance.

758
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:19,909
Speaker 1: The only two things he's ever been excited about are My Little Pony... Specific instance.

759
00:41:20,332 --> 00:41:20,808
Speaker 1: ...and Running Man.

760
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:21,853
Speaker 1: Sure, yeah.

761
00:41:21,873 --> 00:41:26,485
Speaker 1: Okay, so the only things I happen to like in the past week are things I've liked for a whole life.

762
00:41:26,806 --> 00:41:28,270
Speaker 1: I never liked anything else in my whole life.

763
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:34,150
Speaker 0: My argument is that, why not, just because something works okay, why not put a little effort into it?

764
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:38,983
Speaker 0: If someone's into cinema, this is actually a very interesting way to watch the trilogy.

765
00:41:39,023 --> 00:41:41,470
Speaker 0: that probably might elicit different reactions.

766
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:44,501
Speaker 0: I think it enhances the experience, at least a little bit.

767
00:41:44,963 --> 00:41:46,430
Speaker 0: Why not try to optimize your life?

768
00:41:47,211 --> 00:41:49,090
Speaker 1: You're not really... It's not that important.

769
00:41:49,532 --> 00:41:50,074
Speaker 0: I think it is.

770
00:41:50,315 --> 00:41:54,210
Speaker 0: The argument he makes about the parallelism and how four-five and two-three...

771
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,037
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's interesting to read this thing, and you know what?

772
00:41:56,278 --> 00:42:01,450
Speaker 1: Anyone who has seen all the movies multiple times, like we have except... I mean, I've even seen one multiple times.

773
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:04,150
Speaker 0: I've only seen one once, and I actually am never gonna watch it again.

774
00:42:04,251 --> 00:42:07,030
Speaker 1: Just because that's... I'm not gonna watch it again, but that's just how life goes, you know?

775
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:10,963
Speaker 1: But it's like, well then read this article and say, "Oh yeah, this guy's pretty clever,".

776
00:42:11,003 --> 00:42:12,850
Speaker 1: and you'll get the same exact experience we have.

777
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,020
Speaker 1: Watch all the movies a whole bunch of times.

778
00:42:15,322 --> 00:42:16,610
Speaker 1: It's like, some people, they ascribe...

779
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:18,330
Speaker 0: No, don't watch episode one a whole bunch of times.

780
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:24,910
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, people ascribe this sort of magical mystique to like, "The first time you watch it has to be...".

781
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:25,552
Speaker 1: It's like, no.

782
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:30,910
Speaker 1: You're gonna end up, just like everyone else, watching these movies many times and understanding them as a whole.

783
00:42:31,052 --> 00:42:31,930
Speaker 0: So Scott, here's an example.

784
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:33,415
Speaker 1: And you'll be just like every other nerd.

785
00:42:33,596 --> 00:42:37,750
Speaker 1: It's not this unchanging... It's not like you're chiseling it into stone.

786
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:39,923
Speaker 1: The first time you watch it, "Oh, it's in stone.

787
00:42:39,984 --> 00:42:40,628
Speaker 1: It can never be

788
00:42:40,668 --> 00:42:40,930
Speaker 1: changed.".

789
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:49,949
Speaker 0: So Scott, what if the first time you watch Citizen Kane... ...at the beginning instead of at the end?

790
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:51,854
Speaker 0: Does that change the movie at all?

791
00:42:51,955 --> 00:42:56,150
Speaker 0: Are you saying there is literally zero impact on one's experience of first watching?

792
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,583
Speaker 1: You're changing the whole movie.

793
00:42:57,664 --> 00:42:58,330
Speaker 1: That's a different argument.

794
00:42:58,430 --> 00:42:58,954
Speaker 0: Wait, no I'm not.

795
00:42:59,074 --> 00:43:01,349
Speaker 0: I'm moving one revelation...

796
00:43:01,715 --> 00:43:02,310
Speaker 1: No, this is about...

797
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:04,010
Speaker 0: ...from near the end to the beginning.

798
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:07,230
Speaker 1: This is about not the order of multiple movies.

799
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:10,110
Speaker 1: We're talking about one movie as a concrete element.

800
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:11,849
Speaker 0: Oh Scott, but this is one story.

801
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:14,949
Speaker 1: What if I take the Mona Lisa and I put her nose down in her dress?

802
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:16,300
Speaker 0: That's different.

803
00:43:16,503 --> 00:43:16,970
Speaker 0: It's different.

804
00:43:17,291 --> 00:43:21,626
Speaker 1: It's not, "Oh, I looked at the Mona Lisa before I looked at the Van Gogh sunflowers.

805
00:43:21,706 --> 00:43:22,409
Speaker 1: Now it's totally

806
00:43:22,429 --> 00:43:22,770
Speaker 1: different.".

807
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:25,324
Speaker 0: But those aren't part of a narrative, "Mr.

808
00:43:25,424 --> 00:43:26,249
Speaker 0: Everything's Black and

809
00:43:26,289 --> 00:43:26,470
Speaker 0: White.".

810
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:28,970
Speaker 0: There's no possibility in the world for nuance of any kind.

811
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,162
Speaker 0: Right.

812
00:43:30,183 --> 00:43:30,790
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

813
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:34,970
Speaker 0: Anyway, I recommend, if you're going to watch the trilogy again, to watch it in this order.

814
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:36,930
Speaker 0: Because I think, here's my real reason.

815
00:43:37,831 --> 00:43:44,930
Speaker 0: If you don't do it this way, episode one just pisses you off... ...and episodes two and three really fall flat.

816
00:43:45,091 --> 00:43:50,230
Speaker 0: I think this is kind of like cleansing your palate before eating something to make it taste a little bit better.

817
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:53,663
Speaker 0: Or more correctly, it's like putting a whole bunch of sugar on some medicine.

818
00:43:53,683 --> 00:43:55,210
Speaker 0: so it doesn't taste like shit when you eat it.

819
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:56,621
Speaker 1: I recommend you do what I do.

820
00:43:56,701 --> 00:43:57,669
Speaker 1: Just watch four, five, six.

821
00:43:57,990 --> 00:43:58,576
Speaker 1: Four, five, six.

822
00:43:58,859 --> 00:43:59,324
Speaker 1: Four, five, six.

823
00:43:59,344 --> 00:43:59,849
Speaker 1: Four, five, six.

824
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:02,810
Speaker 1: And then watch four, five, six again and pretend one, two, three don't exist.

825
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:08,090
Speaker 1: My order is more... Why would you eat shit just because you put some cinnamon on the shit?

826
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:08,838
Speaker 1: It's still shit.

827
00:44:08,919 --> 00:44:09,789
Speaker 1: Just don't even eat that.

828
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:13,309
Speaker 0: Two's not that bad if you cut out most of it.

829
00:44:13,551 --> 00:44:15,670
Speaker 1: Well, three is the least bad of all of them.

830
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:17,670
Speaker 0: Three's okay if you also cut out most of it.

831
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:18,637
Speaker 1: It's still poop.

832
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:19,929
Speaker 1: Don't eat it.

833
00:44:20,631 --> 00:44:21,769
Speaker 1: Why do you have to watch it?

834
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:25,690
Speaker 1: Just because it has some Star Wars logo on it just means you have to watch it.

835
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:28,347
Speaker 1: Are you watching all those Clone Wars things?

836
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:29,782
Speaker 1: The Cartoon Network?

837
00:44:29,904 --> 00:44:30,189
Speaker 1: one's okay.

838
00:44:30,872 --> 00:44:32,969
Speaker 0: The article actually makes a nice point about that.

839
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:39,030
Speaker 0: About how the conflict of Luke might be turning dark or going toward the dark side barely exists in the original trilogy.

840
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:41,610
Speaker 0: But kind of comes out if you watch it in this order.

841
00:44:42,872 --> 00:44:43,436
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

842
00:44:43,456 --> 00:44:45,410
Speaker 1: It's so much in the original.

843
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:51,330
Speaker 1: Return of the Jedi is all about, in the second half of Empire, it's all about Luke turning to the dark side.

844
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:55,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's a little ham-fisted and it doesn't really play, like it doesn't ring true the whole time.

845
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:56,176
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

846
00:44:56,196 --> 00:44:57,089
Speaker 1: When he goes in the cave?

847
00:44:58,051 --> 00:45:02,530
Speaker 0: Oh, and he meets Darth Vader, but it's actually him under the mask.

848
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:06,169
Speaker 0: Oh my god, the fist ham came out and ham-fisted me.

849
00:45:06,653 --> 00:45:08,409
Speaker 1: But it's like, you're like, oh, it's barely in it.

850
00:45:08,933 --> 00:45:10,029
Speaker 0: I didn't say it's barely in.

851
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:11,630
Speaker 0: You said it's barely in the original.

852
00:45:11,811 --> 00:45:13,509
Speaker 0: I said it barely rings true.

853
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:17,310
Speaker 1: How about in the opening of Return of the Jedi?

854
00:45:18,151 --> 00:45:23,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, most people I found don't actually kind of notice that hint that is talked about.

855
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:24,255
Speaker 1: You know how you notice it?

856
00:45:24,657 --> 00:45:25,200
Speaker 1: Do what I say.

857
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,688
Speaker 1: Just watch it a whole bunch of times.

858
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:28,610
Speaker 0: Or watch the five.

859
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:33,010
Speaker 1: And then anytime somebody says, you know, you will be destroyed, you'll be like, oh.

860
00:45:35,955 --> 00:45:36,310
Speaker 0: Anyway.

861
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:38,630
Speaker 1: Anyone wearing a black hood?

862
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:39,457
Speaker 0: You got a thing of the day?

863
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:40,390
Speaker 0: Captain thing of the day?

864
00:45:40,791 --> 00:45:42,503
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's an okay thing of the day.

865
00:45:42,523 --> 00:45:43,550
Speaker 1: I couldn't find anything so good.

866
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:47,090
Speaker 1: So this guy, it's an Etsy store called Nerd House.

867
00:45:47,591 --> 00:45:49,470
Speaker 1: N-I-R-D-H-A-U-S.

868
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:54,490
Speaker 1: And the reason the nerd has an eye is because he's making a pun on birdhouse.

869
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:59,810
Speaker 1: This dude makes birdhouses and it seems also Christmas ornaments, but mostly birdhouses.

870
00:46:00,451 --> 00:46:01,442
Speaker 1: And he makes them nerdy.

871
00:46:01,523 --> 00:46:02,130
Speaker 1: They're hand-painted.

872
00:46:02,632 --> 00:46:06,008
Speaker 1: And he's got, let's see, speaking of Star Wars, he's got two droids.

873
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:07,643
Speaker 0: Not bad.

874
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:09,836
Speaker 1: He's got a Bob-omb ornament.

875
00:46:09,896 --> 00:46:13,890
Speaker 1: He's got Mario, Luigi, Toad birdhouses.

876
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:19,627
Speaker 1: And the best, the hand-painted Bullet Bill small birdhouse.

877
00:46:20,088 --> 00:46:20,630
Speaker 1: Check that out.

878
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:21,429
Speaker 0: That's pretty good.

879
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:21,932
Speaker 0: Check it out.

880
00:46:22,516 --> 00:46:23,885
Speaker 1: But yeah, nerdy birdhouses.

881
00:46:23,925 --> 00:46:24,610
Speaker 1: Good call, dude.

882
00:46:25,211 --> 00:46:29,650
Speaker 1: That is a craft that I have not seen combined with nerdery yet.

883
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:31,528
Speaker 0: What order should I look at the birdhouses in?

884
00:46:32,411 --> 00:46:33,630
Speaker 1: It doesn't fucking matter.

885
00:46:34,593 --> 00:46:35,662
Speaker 1: You can see them all at once.

886
00:46:35,723 --> 00:46:36,530
Speaker 1: It's a photo gallery.

887
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:40,230
Speaker 0: In the meantime, we are going to be at the Penny Arcade Expo over Easter weekend.

888
00:46:40,991 --> 00:46:42,549
Speaker 1: It's Penny Arcade Expo East.

889
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:44,790
Speaker 0: Yes, 2012.

890
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:46,370
Speaker 0: One lecture, one main lecture.

891
00:46:46,791 --> 00:46:48,150
Speaker 0: Let's play a money-making game.

892
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:52,750
Speaker 0: We are doing a classroom-style tabletop workshop two hours long.

893
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:54,169
Speaker 0: Title to be announced.

894
00:46:54,730 --> 00:47:06,609
Speaker 0: We are also going to be at Anime Boston to do Diamonds in the Rough, which is a retitling of Cover Your Bases, which itself is a retitling of anime you never thought you'd like, which itself is a retitling of Anime You Should See.

895
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:11,088
Speaker 1: The throwaway panel that people come to all the time in droves.

896
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:12,789
Speaker 0: Because people don't know what to watch.

897
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:15,589
Speaker 0: And we need to tell them what order to watch Star Wars in.

898
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:22,530
Speaker 1: Because unlike, say, PAX, where it's the same people over and over again, the anime cons get this sort of turnover.

899
00:47:23,611 --> 00:47:26,289
Speaker 1: You get the new fan comes in, the old fan goes out.

900
00:47:27,955 --> 00:47:28,660
Speaker 0: I wonder why.

901
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:29,810
Speaker 0: Maybe we've talked about that.

902
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:31,670
Speaker 0: But anyway, that's it.

903
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:32,609
Speaker 1: Is there any other metas?

904
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:33,578
Speaker 0: Nah, not really.

905
00:47:33,618 --> 00:47:34,570
Speaker 0: Go to our YouTube channel.

906
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:35,292
Speaker 0: I got some more.

907
00:47:35,413 --> 00:47:39,750
Speaker 0: I found a bunch of old video that I never did anything with from PAX East 2011.

908
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:48,188
Speaker 0: So I'm putting up a PAX East 2012 preparation montage to get you ready, if you've never been to PAX East, for what PAX East is truly like.

909
00:47:49,232 --> 00:47:51,190
Speaker 0: Has such hits as The Cavernous Venue.

910
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:53,669
Speaker 0: I forgot how big Secret Tabletop was.

911
00:47:54,476 --> 00:47:56,110
Speaker 0: As in, bigger than Magfest.

912
00:47:59,431 --> 00:48:04,110
Speaker 0: So alright, we went on Star Wars for a while, but filtering the internet doesn't work.

913
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:05,173
Speaker 1: No it doesn't.

914
00:48:05,294 --> 00:48:08,010
Speaker 1: I mean, what is there to say about this?

915
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:16,450
Speaker 1: So some people, for whatever reason, have a computer, and they don't want people on that computer looking at certain things that come from the internet.

916
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:16,873
Speaker 1: Now the thing

917
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:30,090
Speaker 0: is, it usually comes down to, don't let people look at porn, which the real question I have here, and this is what we were discussing before we did the show, why are so many people trying to look at porn on every internet connection they get their grubby little hands on?

918
00:48:31,031 --> 00:48:32,080
Speaker 0: Why is this such a problem?

919
00:48:32,141 --> 00:48:33,210
Speaker 0: I was at IBM, right?

920
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:34,417
Speaker 0: Years ago.

921
00:48:34,437 --> 00:48:35,810
Speaker 0: A decade ago.

922
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:45,950
Speaker 0: And more than once, factory workers broke into labs by jimmying open the doors to look at porn on the PCs in those labs that weren't filtered.

923
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:47,988
Speaker 1: I was at the RIT library once.

924
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:50,590
Speaker 1: You know, in little QB areas where they had computers.

925
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:51,990
Speaker 0: Oh you mean the nap rooms?

926
00:48:52,492 --> 00:48:52,772
Speaker 1: Right.

927
00:48:53,515 --> 00:49:00,578
Speaker 1: And I'm just sitting there, computing, doing actual work, and this dude behind me, I just happened to notice, he's looking at porn.

928
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:02,630
Speaker 1: He's not whacking it in the library.

929
00:49:04,412 --> 00:49:05,377
Speaker 1: And he's trying to hide it too.

930
00:49:05,538 --> 00:49:07,950
Speaker 1: He's minimizing it, looking around his shoulder, opening it again.

931
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:11,590
Speaker 1: It's like, why are you looking at prawn in the library?

932
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:13,642
Speaker 1: Can't you just look at it somewhere?

933
00:49:13,683 --> 00:49:14,570
Speaker 1: Maybe that's your thing.

934
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:17,890
Speaker 1: It's sort of like you're one of those people, you get off on the fact that it's in public.

935
00:49:18,291 --> 00:49:23,770
Speaker 0: But why are so many businessmen getting caught all the time with porn on their laptops and porn on their office PCs?

936
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:32,109
Speaker 0: Do you know how many people, I did the filtering for part of IBM, how many factory workers just constantly tried to find porn?

937
00:49:34,034 --> 00:49:35,690
Speaker 0: They went for porn more than anything.

938
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:37,313
Speaker 1: It's like, why?

939
00:49:37,573 --> 00:49:43,490
Speaker 1: I mean, not to say I never look at porn ever, but I don't look at porn in public, or constantly.

940
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:45,888
Speaker 1: It's like, come on.

941
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:54,390
Speaker 0: I mean, I've read a bunch of articles recently talking about how much of a problem people just looking at porn on their iPads on planes has been lately.

942
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:55,750
Speaker 0: And at airports.

943
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:57,661
Speaker 1: It's like, why would you even want to?

944
00:49:57,721 --> 00:49:58,970
Speaker 1: Why does it need to be blocked?

945
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:01,903
Speaker 0: I mean, all right, so worst case, all right, so let's say I'm a businessman.

946
00:50:01,943 --> 00:50:03,129
Speaker 0: I really want to get my porn on.

947
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:04,970
Speaker 1: In your hotel room, dude.

948
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:06,915
Speaker 1: That's what hotel rooms are for.

949
00:50:06,935 --> 00:50:10,370
Speaker 1: They even sell porn in hotel rooms, specifically for that purpose.

950
00:50:10,551 --> 00:50:15,430
Speaker 0: I open up my, like, mulatto butts folder and I'm looking through and all right, great.

951
00:50:15,671 --> 00:50:19,429
Speaker 0: Now I've got a raging erection and no way to do anything about that.

952
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,076
Speaker 1: You can join the restaurant on a plane.

953
00:50:21,096 --> 00:50:21,940
Speaker 1: Maybe there's someone with you.

954
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,890
Speaker 1: You can go to the Mile High Club in the bathroom or something.

955
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:24,614
Speaker 0: That doesn't work.

956
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:26,650
Speaker 0: If you've been in, that doesn't actually work.

957
00:50:27,071 --> 00:50:29,846
Speaker 1: I'm just trying to say like, look, that's how crazy it is.

958
00:50:29,906 --> 00:50:30,670
Speaker 1: That's, you know.

959
00:50:30,971 --> 00:50:34,950
Speaker 1: And even then, if you had someone to join the Mile High Club with, what do you need the porn for?

960
00:50:35,592 --> 00:50:45,829
Speaker 0: Now, I do understand why, like, schools try to filter because, you know, like in elementary school, they'd rather avoid the problem of Jimmy was looking at hardcore pornography on the school's PC.

961
00:50:46,213 --> 00:50:46,426
Speaker 1: Yeah.

962
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:52,690
Speaker 0: But in my experience, those filters never prevent Jimmy from looking at the hardcore pornography.

963
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:57,209
Speaker 0: They only stop Bimmy, Jimmy's slightly dumber brother from doing it.

964
00:50:57,372 --> 00:50:57,590
Speaker 0: Right.

965
00:50:57,810 --> 00:50:59,697
Speaker 0: Because I remember as a kid, you know, it's weird.

966
00:50:59,717 --> 00:51:03,370
Speaker 0: When we grew up, I was, you know, computers were just starting to really appear in schools.

967
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:04,372
Speaker 0: We had Internet access.

968
00:51:04,814 --> 00:51:11,090
Speaker 0: And I remember I would, quote unquote, hack things like, oh, there's a public share with all the grades on them.

969
00:51:12,671 --> 00:51:19,029
Speaker 0: Or, oh, if I just don't log in, suddenly there's no restrictions because the restriction scripts only kick off after I log in.

970
00:51:19,436 --> 00:51:19,647
Speaker 1: Yep.

971
00:51:20,871 --> 00:51:23,490
Speaker 0: So I was pretty much able to do whatever I wanted on the Internet.

972
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:27,050
Speaker 1: Dude, we could go to the Q drive and there was like a network admin program.

973
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:30,522
Speaker 1: You'd run it and then you were the network admin for the whole town.

974
00:51:31,044 --> 00:51:32,590
Speaker 1: Like you could change the mayor's password.

975
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:36,506
Speaker 1: All you had to do was double click on Q and then double click on this EXE file.

976
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:37,490
Speaker 1: It was crazy.

977
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:41,330
Speaker 1: And the reason they expected you to not be able to do that was because you couldn't.

978
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:42,012
Speaker 1: Oh, they made it.

979
00:51:42,053 --> 00:51:45,550
Speaker 1: so there were no icons or anything to click on to do Windows Explorer.

980
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:49,910
Speaker 1: But if you pressed F3, you can get the find files dialog and you just did a little search.

981
00:51:50,431 --> 00:51:56,869
Speaker 1: And if any folders showed up in your search, you search for Windows, obviously, you right click on Windows and you click explore and then explore would open up.

982
00:51:57,450 --> 00:51:57,519
Speaker 0: Yep.

983
00:51:58,312 --> 00:51:59,609
Speaker 1: And it was really retarded.

984
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:00,609
Speaker 0: Those were good old days.

985
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:06,450
Speaker 0: Now, the only filters that actually work, in my opinion, are straight up whitelist filters.

986
00:52:07,371 --> 00:52:12,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the one way that you have a filter that actually works is you can visit these things and no other things.

987
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:20,770
Speaker 1: So if you whitelist, you know, Google dot com and CNN dot com, well, no one's going to see any porn because, you know, there isn't going to be porn on CNN dot com.

988
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:23,030
Speaker 1: And, you know, there isn't going to be porn because I'm on Google.

989
00:52:23,171 --> 00:52:23,352
Speaker 0: Right.

990
00:52:23,392 --> 00:52:26,790
Speaker 0: So I go to Google Images and there is amazing amounts of porn.

991
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:28,469
Speaker 1: No, but safe search is forced to be on.

992
00:52:28,973 --> 00:52:29,708
Speaker 0: How do I force that?

993
00:52:30,051 --> 00:52:36,430
Speaker 1: You can force that if you are on the proxy, the proxy can force the proxy, which is what you'd be using anyway.

994
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:38,869
Speaker 0: Even then, I do occasionally find porn with safe search on.

995
00:52:39,454 --> 00:52:40,569
Speaker 0: I'm often looking very rarely.

996
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:48,750
Speaker 1: See, the thing is with porn is that it's actually somewhat, you know, it's sort of a solved problem being able to detect porn technologically.

997
00:52:49,171 --> 00:52:49,392
Speaker 1: Right.

998
00:52:49,653 --> 00:52:53,790
Speaker 1: It's like for other things like spam filtering, you need people to say that's spam, that's not spam.

999
00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:55,648
Speaker 1: And with porn, we still sort of do that.

1000
00:52:55,708 --> 00:52:55,850
Speaker 1: Right.

1001
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:58,270
Speaker 1: People go into Google's and be like, oh, that's porn.

1002
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:00,090
Speaker 1: They market is porn or something like that.

1003
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:02,650
Speaker 1: So Google knows and learns what's porn and what's not.

1004
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:05,768
Speaker 1: But really, you know, porn sort of looks like something.

1005
00:53:05,809 --> 00:53:06,010
Speaker 1: Right.

1006
00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:09,370
Speaker 1: It's like we have, you know, face detection technology.

1007
00:53:09,691 --> 00:53:15,050
Speaker 1: We can find faces and specific people's faces in images, you know, with computers.

1008
00:53:15,512 --> 00:53:17,406
Speaker 1: We can find dicks to same stuff.

1009
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:17,910
Speaker 1: Right.

1010
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:19,154
Speaker 1: We can find boobs.

1011
00:53:19,716 --> 00:53:23,030
Speaker 1: You know, it's like you can just have a computer program, look at tons and tons of images.

1012
00:53:23,252 --> 00:53:24,967
Speaker 1: And it can be like, boo, that one has a boob.

1013
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:26,318
Speaker 0: That one has a penis.

1014
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:27,330
Speaker 0: Think about what that does.

1015
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:28,109
Speaker 1: That one has a vagina.

1016
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:34,830
Speaker 0: That'll basically filter out an increasingly wide swath of the middle of the porn curve.

1017
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:40,430
Speaker 0: The most generic vanilla porn, leaving only the extremes that don't show up in the filter.

1018
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:45,410
Speaker 1: No, it's actually, the thing is, there's so much porn on the internet, even extreme porn gets filtered.

1019
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:49,070
Speaker 0: No, I mean, the extreme fetishes, though, like pedal pushing.

1020
00:53:49,615 --> 00:53:50,770
Speaker 0: Is it really going to find?

1021
00:53:51,492 --> 00:53:52,945
Speaker 1: But that's, you know, that's not porn.

1022
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:54,749
Speaker 0: So what's the definition of porn?

1023
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:56,279
Speaker 1: Well, we're not talking about that.

1024
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,750
Speaker 1: We're talking about the filtering part, not the porn part.

1025
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:58,675
Speaker 0: So why do we filter then?

1026
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:01,430
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess this is a question we can't answer.

1027
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:06,930
Speaker 0: They don't understand why, when the adults are involved, we actually have to filter.

1028
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:09,601
Speaker 0: Why do so many businesses have to filter?

1029
00:54:09,641 --> 00:54:11,870
Speaker 0: because so many people are trying to see porn all the time?

1030
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:15,450
Speaker 1: Like, if I was a company, right, I mean, I refuse to work anywhere that has filtering.

1031
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:16,776
Speaker 0: My company has no filtering.

1032
00:54:17,017 --> 00:54:18,826
Speaker 0: The hospital I worked at had crazy filtering.

1033
00:54:18,866 --> 00:54:19,750
Speaker 0: It was a giant pain in the ass.

1034
00:54:19,931 --> 00:54:27,788
Speaker 1: If I was a company and I had a lot of employees, not just a few people I know, I wouldn't have filtering, but I would have monitoring of the office network.

1035
00:54:27,868 --> 00:54:28,090
Speaker 1: Right.

1036
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:35,750
Speaker 1: And it's like, you know, I'm willing to tolerate at work at an on the office network monitoring, even on a work computer.

1037
00:54:35,891 --> 00:54:40,790
Speaker 1: Even, you know, you could put the monitoring on the work computer because I don't do non-work on the work computer.

1038
00:54:40,931 --> 00:54:42,709
Speaker 1: I have complete separation, which is how it should be.

1039
00:54:43,471 --> 00:54:45,580
Speaker 1: And it's like, well, this doesn't belong to me.

1040
00:54:45,942 --> 00:54:47,950
Speaker 1: So they have a right to know how it's being used.

1041
00:54:48,010 --> 00:54:49,698
Speaker 1: It's their resources that they're paying for.

1042
00:54:49,718 --> 00:54:52,330
Speaker 1: You know, they should be able to know if I visited porn.

1043
00:54:52,751 --> 00:54:56,065
Speaker 1: And if they want to go and look and say, oh, you visited porn, you're fired.

1044
00:54:56,306 --> 00:54:57,270
Speaker 1: That's totally cool.

1045
00:54:57,490 --> 00:54:58,494
Speaker 1: In fact, that's what I would do.

1046
00:54:58,575 --> 00:55:02,390
Speaker 1: If I had the company, I would monitor anyone who got caught visiting the porn.

1047
00:55:02,751 --> 00:55:04,737
Speaker 1: It's like, well, we wouldn't filter it because that might.

1048
00:55:04,777 --> 00:55:10,413
Speaker 1: that filtering might also have false positives that make it harder for people to do their jobs, especially technological jobs.

1049
00:55:10,694 --> 00:55:17,010
Speaker 1: And it would slow the network down and would cost us money paying for this proprietary filtering package that we had to buy and whatever.

1050
00:55:17,991 --> 00:55:19,096
Speaker 1: But I still monitor you.

1051
00:55:19,176 --> 00:55:20,000
Speaker 1: And that should be enough.

1052
00:55:20,402 --> 00:55:20,623
Speaker 1: Right.

1053
00:55:20,703 --> 00:55:21,627
Speaker 1: I saw that you did it.

1054
00:55:21,668 --> 00:55:22,210
Speaker 1: You got caught.

1055
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:25,070
Speaker 1: And now you're fired because you're looking to porn at work or using your work computer.

1056
00:55:26,732 --> 00:55:28,822
Speaker 1: And why can't you know, anyone else do the same thing?

1057
00:55:28,882 --> 00:55:30,490
Speaker 1: Why can't you know, I was at the court today.

1058
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:31,854
Speaker 1: Why couldn't they just monitor?

1059
00:55:32,175 --> 00:55:37,130
Speaker 1: And if anyone looks at porn, then it detects that and then just kicks you off the network or something.

1060
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:38,435
Speaker 0: But isn't that almost a honeypot?

1061
00:55:38,455 --> 00:55:39,621
Speaker 0: Because they're going to look at porn.

1062
00:55:39,842 --> 00:55:41,550
Speaker 0: You're just going to weed out all the people who look at porn.

1063
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:42,688
Speaker 1: I didn't look at the porn.

1064
00:55:43,671 --> 00:55:44,152
Speaker 0: They will.

1065
00:55:44,293 --> 00:55:46,038
Speaker 1: So it's not even just it would make as well.

1066
00:55:46,058 --> 00:55:47,161
Speaker 1: For example, I was on.

1067
00:55:47,221 --> 00:55:50,150
Speaker 1: I was on Reddit at the off at the work at the court.

1068
00:55:50,391 --> 00:55:50,652
Speaker 1: Right.

1069
00:55:50,752 --> 00:55:52,077
Speaker 1: And most of Reddit worked.

1070
00:55:52,157 --> 00:55:54,586
Speaker 1: And Imgur worked, which, funnily enough, has a lot of porn on it.

1071
00:55:54,687 --> 00:55:55,610
Speaker 0: Mostly Digimon.

1072
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:56,331
Speaker 1: Right.

1073
00:55:56,391 --> 00:55:58,235
Speaker 1: But quick meme was filtered.

1074
00:55:58,716 --> 00:56:04,770
Speaker 1: And every time I tried to click on a Reddit link to quick meme, I would get the courts page, which I assume meant that it was filtered.

1075
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:07,901
Speaker 1: It didn't actually say it was filtered, but that was what was going on.

1076
00:56:08,363 --> 00:56:10,230
Speaker 1: But it's like, OK, there must be porn on quick meme.

1077
00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:11,633
Speaker 1: It's in their blacklist or something.

1078
00:56:11,714 --> 00:56:15,744
Speaker 1: But what I was trying to look at specifically wasn't porn.

1079
00:56:15,764 --> 00:56:18,210
Speaker 1: It was some other image on quick meme, probably with a funny caption.

1080
00:56:19,691 --> 00:56:23,610
Speaker 1: And I looked at it just now because I went back to the link and it was a funny caption on an Amish guy.

1081
00:56:24,311 --> 00:56:28,030
Speaker 1: And it's like, well, with monitoring, they would, you know, that wouldn't have been a problem.

1082
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:31,409
Speaker 0: But with focus, then they have to do human intervention, which costs money.

1083
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:36,830
Speaker 0: The porn filter costs money to not nearly as much as a human going through stupid logs.

1084
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:44,270
Speaker 0: I think a real better solution is you monitor usage, but you don't look at that like it's just archived in case there's a problem.

1085
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:53,070
Speaker 0: Like, say, you know, you've got employees not getting any fucking work done and, you know, a month goes by, you look and see, oh, he does nothing but surf Reddit all day.

1086
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:56,459
Speaker 1: The thing is, I do know there's an HR complaint.

1087
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:58,890
Speaker 0: Oh, look at all the hardcore porn he's been watching.

1088
00:56:59,731 --> 00:57:04,450
Speaker 1: I guess, you know, you could detect other things, though, like did a guy fill up this hard drive is using too much bandwidth?

1089
00:57:04,591 --> 00:57:07,401
Speaker 1: And then if one of those alarms sort of goes off, right?

1090
00:57:07,762 --> 00:57:09,710
Speaker 1: Or you can sort of have a thing that sort of looks at images.

1091
00:57:10,331 --> 00:57:14,790
Speaker 1: And if it starts to see dicks in them, then an alarm would go off and it would sort of say, hey, check out this guy.

1092
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:18,767
Speaker 1: You're not saying you shouldn't manually look at everything everyone does.

1093
00:57:18,807 --> 00:57:19,330
Speaker 1: That's crazy.

1094
00:57:19,590 --> 00:57:25,350
Speaker 1: You sort of have these alarms in the monitoring that say, here's some specific, you know, suspicious activity.

1095
00:57:25,691 --> 00:57:26,674
Speaker 1: Take a look at this.

1096
00:57:26,754 --> 00:57:28,561
Speaker 1: And then you investigate those instances.

1097
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,547
Speaker 1: And that's going to catch 99 percent.

1098
00:57:31,551 --> 00:57:37,630
Speaker 0: So what about filtering that businesses use to block malicious sites because users are dumbasses and get Trojans all the time?

1099
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:43,970
Speaker 1: The computers should be locked down enough to where no one should be able to get that sort of thing on their computer.

1100
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:44,171
Speaker 0: Should be.

1101
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:44,654
Speaker 0: Usually aren't.

1102
00:57:44,855 --> 00:57:47,629
Speaker 0: And those people will often do everything they can to get around that.

1103
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:52,925
Speaker 1: Just re- if anyone fucks with their computer, re-image that shit and be like, oh, that's it.

1104
00:57:53,507 --> 00:57:54,230
Speaker 1: That's all there is to it.

1105
00:57:54,791 --> 00:57:57,876
Speaker 0: So what about filtering for bandwidth problems?

1106
00:57:57,916 --> 00:58:06,390
Speaker 0: Like, it's weird how more and more colleges like the idea of a college in any way filtering basic Internet was crazy to me when I went to college.

1107
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:07,756
Speaker 0: Like, that was ludicrous.

1108
00:58:07,796 --> 00:58:08,198
Speaker 1: We went to.

1109
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,990
Speaker 1: we went to RIT, which I'm pretty sure still has complete unfiltered Internet.

1110
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:14,184
Speaker 0: Most of the other people I know went to other colleges.

1111
00:58:14,265 --> 00:58:15,290
Speaker 1: Non-technical places.

1112
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:15,790
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1113
00:58:15,810 --> 00:58:16,953
Speaker 0: Non-tech colleges were the same.

1114
00:58:17,534 --> 00:58:24,190
Speaker 0: And now I'm seeing more and more reports of people who are like there was even a Slashdot, like ask Slashdot where the guy was like, yo, dog.

1115
00:58:24,491 --> 00:58:26,683
Speaker 0: My college filters everything.

1116
00:58:26,763 --> 00:58:28,030
Speaker 0: How do I get on the real Internet?

1117
00:58:28,852 --> 00:58:29,690
Speaker 1: Go to a different college.

1118
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:31,313
Speaker 0: Actually, this is weird.

1119
00:58:31,373 --> 00:58:35,682
Speaker 0: how kind of old and conservative Slashdot is getting, because most of the comments were you should be studying.

1120
00:58:35,702 --> 00:58:38,928
Speaker 0: Don't you know, you shouldn't have the right to free Internet at college.

1121
00:58:39,009 --> 00:58:39,670
Speaker 0: That's bullshit.

1122
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:41,354
Speaker 1: What are you talking about?

1123
00:58:41,374 --> 00:58:41,696
Speaker 0: That's all.

1124
00:58:41,736 --> 00:58:43,161
Speaker 1: college is, is free Internet.

1125
00:58:43,503 --> 00:58:44,567
Speaker 1: First thing I do, get in the door.

1126
00:58:44,627 --> 00:58:45,149
Speaker 1: Oh my God, OZ3s.

1127
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:49,150
Speaker 0: Except now I have similarly fast connection through FiOS.

1128
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:50,936
Speaker 1: Not like OZ3s.

1129
00:58:51,157 --> 00:58:53,609
Speaker 1: Well, you forget exactly how fast it was.

1130
00:58:54,192 --> 00:58:56,002
Speaker 0: It was mostly not because of the OZ3s.

1131
00:58:56,042 --> 00:58:57,168
Speaker 0: It was because of the Internet too.

1132
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:00,630
Speaker 0: And because the only thing I was doing was pirating stuff from other people.

1133
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:05,700
Speaker 1: Apparently there's an ISP in California that it's called like it's the best ISP there is.

1134
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:10,870
Speaker 1: You can get gigabit for 60 bucks a month, but only in this like one area where they have fiber and such.

1135
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:18,770
Speaker 1: You can apparently when you click on a YouTube video, the entire video buffers instantly like click boom.

1136
00:59:19,370 --> 00:59:22,850
Speaker 1: Like it's a hundred percent buffer before you can even see the thing moving.

1137
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:34,870
Speaker 0: Kids usually say made up myths in video games like I heard that there's a place outside of canaria where if you walk in a circle a thousand times, Aris comes back to life and kills Lincoln.

1138
00:59:34,890 --> 00:59:35,372
Speaker 1: That's what they say.

1139
00:59:35,412 --> 00:59:38,787
Speaker 1: They say the YouTube videos, even a 1080p buffer instantly.

1140
00:59:38,927 --> 00:59:39,590
Speaker 1: One hundred percent.

1141
00:59:40,692 --> 00:59:42,098
Speaker 0: I guess it depends on the video.

1142
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:42,400
Speaker 0: I have.

1143
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:43,726
Speaker 0: I uploaded a video recently.

1144
00:59:43,766 --> 00:59:44,168
Speaker 0: It was 18 gigabytes.

1145
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:45,070
Speaker 1: I'm sure.

1146
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:50,810
Speaker 0: So it would take 18 gigabytes divided by 1000 gigabits per second.

1147
00:59:51,071 --> 00:59:58,970
Speaker 1: The speed test, the speed test dot net JPEGs from these people are like hundreds of megabytes per second download.

1148
00:59:59,876 --> 01:00:00,789
Speaker 1: It's crazy anyway.

1149
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:02,812
Speaker 0: All right.

1150
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:08,130
Speaker 0: So what about non porn filtering?

1151
01:00:08,891 --> 01:00:18,970
Speaker 0: Because one thing I remember in my high school was that in my middle school especially was that they blocked anything that was even remotely controversial to anyone.

1152
01:00:19,511 --> 01:00:26,510
Speaker 0: And furthermore, I've seen a lot of articles talking about how schools are more and more blocking Wikipedia to prevent people from using it as a reference.

1153
01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:31,170
Speaker 1: It's not going to prevent anyone from using it as a reference because they'll just go home and use it as a reference.

1154
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:37,630
Speaker 0: So should schools block content that isn't pornographic or straight up illegal?

1155
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:41,770
Speaker 1: I think that I think it actually should be illegal to do that.

1156
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:43,410
Speaker 0: Do they have a right to is another question.

1157
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:45,037
Speaker 1: I think it should actually be illegal to do that.

1158
01:00:45,057 --> 01:00:46,001
Speaker 1: That's like banning books.

1159
01:00:46,182 --> 01:00:46,945
Speaker 1: It's like you can't do that.

1160
01:00:47,006 --> 01:00:47,609
Speaker 1: It's the same thing.

1161
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:52,370
Speaker 1: What's the difference between blocking Wikipedia and banning a book from the library?

1162
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:53,989
Speaker 0: Well, they ban books all the time.

1163
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:54,830
Speaker 1: You shouldn't.

1164
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:55,838
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they do.

1165
01:00:55,859 --> 01:00:56,508
Speaker 0: They have a right to.

1166
01:00:56,916 --> 01:00:57,289
Speaker 1: No, you don't.

1167
01:00:57,671 --> 01:00:58,028
Speaker 0: Yeah, they do.

1168
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:00,089
Speaker 1: No, you can't ban books.

1169
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:01,857
Speaker 0: Schools just ban books all the time.

1170
01:01:01,897 --> 01:01:04,590
Speaker 0: It's not freedom of speech for a school to say, yeah, we're not going to carry this book.

1171
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:05,989
Speaker 0: I disagree.

1172
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:11,289
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's like, you know, if you if a kid brings the book to school, then that's OK.

1173
01:01:11,914 --> 01:01:12,168
Speaker 0: Usually.

1174
01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:12,970
Speaker 1: Right.

1175
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:13,634
Speaker 0: But then again.

1176
01:01:13,694 --> 01:01:13,937
Speaker 0: All right.

1177
01:01:13,957 --> 01:01:15,389
Speaker 0: So the kid brings hustler to school.

1178
01:01:16,156 --> 01:01:16,529
Speaker 1: All right.

1179
01:01:17,155 --> 01:01:18,670
Speaker 0: So it's probably going to get taken away.

1180
01:01:19,173 --> 01:01:21,090
Speaker 1: Is he making a distraction in the classroom?

1181
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:25,350
Speaker 0: Well, apparently he's gonna because if everyone just looks at porn, the first chance they get.

1182
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:28,010
Speaker 1: Well, then it's a distraction in the classroom.

1183
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:31,450
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter whether it's porn or whether it's a really cool pencil with ponies on it.

1184
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:32,790
Speaker 1: It's a distraction in the classroom.

1185
01:01:33,851 --> 01:01:35,768
Speaker 1: I mean, that's pretty much all it comes down to.

1186
01:01:36,272 --> 01:01:37,683
Speaker 0: So how about parents?

1187
01:01:37,724 --> 01:01:38,450
Speaker 0: I just I keep asking.

1188
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:44,030
Speaker 1: I mean, I think the fundamental thing here is that why I'm in favor of monitoring when necessary, but not filtering.

1189
01:01:44,433 --> 01:01:47,070
Speaker 1: Is that filtering is sort of like this pre justice.

1190
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:47,511
Speaker 1: Right.

1191
01:01:47,531 --> 01:01:51,110
Speaker 1: It comes in beforehand and punishes before you did anything.

1192
01:01:51,392 --> 01:01:53,690
Speaker 1: Whereas monitoring is like it's fair justice.

1193
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:58,610
Speaker 1: It's like we watch and if you do something bad and you get caught, then we punish you.

1194
01:01:58,710 --> 01:01:59,687
Speaker 1: Wait, it's totally legit.

1195
01:02:00,010 --> 01:02:02,929
Speaker 0: You've just independently derived the way free speech works in the US.

1196
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:03,956
Speaker 1: Oh, no.

1197
01:02:04,058 --> 01:02:04,970
Speaker 0: Did I tell.

1198
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:05,958
Speaker 0: That's how we did it.

1199
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,030
Speaker 0: That's how we do it.

1200
01:02:08,173 --> 01:02:08,538
Speaker 0: Funny.

1201
01:02:08,985 --> 01:02:09,290
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1202
01:02:09,611 --> 01:02:10,294
Speaker 0: So what about?

1203
01:02:10,374 --> 01:02:13,590
Speaker 0: because it's interesting how rapidly things change when we were kids.

1204
01:02:13,811 --> 01:02:14,496
Speaker 0: There's no Internet.

1205
01:02:14,516 --> 01:02:16,229
Speaker 0: Like there was nothing I could do.

1206
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:18,150
Speaker 0: And then Prodigy was a walled garden.

1207
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:18,735
Speaker 0: There was nothing.

1208
01:02:18,755 --> 01:02:20,290
Speaker 0: I mean, I hang out with weird people.

1209
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:24,050
Speaker 1: Well, the later Prodigy had webs and email part wasn't a walled garden.

1210
01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:24,949
Speaker 1: It was real emails.

1211
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:27,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there weren't any people to really email.

1212
01:02:28,032 --> 01:02:30,290
Speaker 0: Like you'd have to go out of your way to get into trouble in those places.

1213
01:02:30,410 --> 01:02:31,428
Speaker 0: You had to really be looking for it.

1214
01:02:32,151 --> 01:02:35,190
Speaker 1: But I'm sure you could get some guy to email you some prawns.

1215
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:36,430
Speaker 1: That was mad pixelated.

1216
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:40,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, but bandwidth was, you know, awesome pixelated as DOS prawn game.

1217
01:02:40,830 --> 01:02:41,248
Speaker 1: They existed.

1218
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:45,706
Speaker 0: So anyway, we grew up in an era where there you didn't really like.

1219
01:02:45,746 --> 01:02:49,388
Speaker 0: there wasn't a lot of filtering, partly because the tech savvy kids, you know, were different.

1220
01:02:49,991 --> 01:02:50,569
Speaker 0: Everything was weird.

1221
01:02:52,492 --> 01:02:55,202
Speaker 0: Now, does it even make sense, for example, a parent like it?

1222
01:02:55,402 --> 01:02:57,570
Speaker 0: should a parent give a kid a smartphone?

1223
01:02:57,711 --> 01:03:01,029
Speaker 0: And if so, should they try to filter it independent of any other PC?

1224
01:03:01,391 --> 01:03:04,830
Speaker 1: I think there is one thing that you definitely have to filter if you give a kid a smartphone.

1225
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:06,390
Speaker 0: The ability to buy things.

1226
01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:07,846
Speaker 1: Yes, the ability to spend money.

1227
01:03:07,927 --> 01:03:08,130
Speaker 1: Right.

1228
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:16,550
Speaker 1: Unless the kid is spending his own goddamn money, you can't just give your kid, no matter how responsible they are, the ability to spend all your freaking money.

1229
01:03:16,935 --> 01:03:17,288
Speaker 0: I disagree.

1230
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:19,690
Speaker 0: If the kid is responsible, you could because he's not gonna.

1231
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:23,850
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah, you could, you know, do the monitoring thing like, oh, you spent all the money.

1232
01:03:23,870 --> 01:03:24,650
Speaker 1: Now you're in trouble.

1233
01:03:24,771 --> 01:03:26,710
Speaker 1: But you can't get the money back.

1234
01:03:26,851 --> 01:03:28,389
Speaker 1: So it's like you're taking a risk.

1235
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:32,868
Speaker 0: You know, when I was a little kid, I had my parents credit card numbers in case they ever needed them.

1236
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:36,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess I would just buy stuff online with their credit card.

1237
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:39,170
Speaker 0: And I'd be like, Mom, I bought this hard drive and they didn't care.

1238
01:03:39,312 --> 01:03:40,084
Speaker 0: No, they told me to.

1239
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:43,450
Speaker 1: OK, if you have my we didn't have that kind of money.

1240
01:03:43,732 --> 01:03:45,610
Speaker 1: If I were to spend money, we didn't have it either.

1241
01:03:45,630 --> 01:03:48,050
Speaker 0: It's just I was like, I feel like I'm going to buy a thing.

1242
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:49,909
Speaker 0: Like I didn't I didn't go buy a Ferrari.

1243
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:51,509
Speaker 0: I didn't go buy a laptop.

1244
01:03:52,592 --> 01:03:54,029
Speaker 1: Yeah, I spent my own monies.

1245
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:55,929
Speaker 1: I had to earn the monies before I could spend it.

1246
01:03:56,172 --> 01:03:56,809
Speaker 0: It was my money.

1247
01:03:56,950 --> 01:03:58,570
Speaker 0: Just I needed a credit card to buy stuff online.

1248
01:03:58,750 --> 01:03:59,528
Speaker 0: I have to pay my parents back.

1249
01:03:59,871 --> 01:04:01,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll pay him back.

1250
01:04:01,431 --> 01:04:01,693
Speaker 1: Sure.

1251
01:04:01,794 --> 01:04:03,390
Speaker 0: But I had the credit card number.

1252
01:04:03,470 --> 01:04:07,510
Speaker 0: There was nothing to stop me from buying the Ferrari other than, I guess, the credit limit.

1253
01:04:08,391 --> 01:04:11,309
Speaker 1: You can't buy a Ferrari online with a credit card.

1254
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:13,389
Speaker 1: I just hate to tell you that.

1255
01:04:13,551 --> 01:04:14,328
Speaker 1: You can't even do that now.

1256
01:04:14,811 --> 01:04:18,610
Speaker 0: So is there any value, though, in trying to filter content for little kids?

1257
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:20,790
Speaker 0: You know, like the four year old who's just going to be online?

1258
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:25,590
Speaker 1: Because the thing is, I don't even think the four year olds are going to look they're not going to come across it.

1259
01:04:25,851 --> 01:04:26,114
Speaker 1: Right.

1260
01:04:26,175 --> 01:04:27,430
Speaker 1: It's like, what are they going to do?

1261
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:30,050
Speaker 1: They're going to turn the phone on and they're going to see ponies or something.

1262
01:04:30,190 --> 01:04:30,989
Speaker 1: That's what they're going to touch.

1263
01:04:31,513 --> 01:04:32,769
Speaker 1: And then they're going to mess with that.

1264
01:04:32,830 --> 01:04:34,118
Speaker 1: They're not even going to try.

1265
01:04:34,138 --> 01:04:35,970
Speaker 1: They're going to type in porn.

1266
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:53,930
Speaker 0: So there was just an article on Slashdot talking about how, and we've known this for a while, Slashdot's just late, about how there's a huge trend in targeting children for malware and data mining by making children centric games and websites that just collect data and then do bullshit.

1267
01:04:54,850 --> 01:05:11,690
Speaker 1: Well, you know, if you keep your kid from spending your money on apps and stuff like that and installing apps and whatever, then, you know, you give them a nice restricted account on Windows and such and only then, you know, he's not going to be able to install, you know, then it's the adult's fault for installing something that looked like a kid's app, but it was actually a shady malware.

1268
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:14,329
Speaker 0: But is there any value in just content filtering for kids?

1269
01:05:16,814 --> 01:05:17,649
Speaker 0: Is there any value?

1270
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:21,570
Speaker 1: This is just one of those situations, right, where it's the lazy parent, right?

1271
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:33,950
Speaker 1: It's like they want to sort of feel like they're a good parent and they think that keeping things out of their kid's vision is making them a better parent, but they don't want to work too hard at it and actually, you know, be there with their kids.

1272
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:45,647
Speaker 1: You know, they're like, "Oh, they want to be able to go and drink wine secretly in the pantry and just chill out and let the kid do whatever he's going to do without supervising him, even though they're really

1273
01:05:45,688 --> 01:05:46,029
Speaker 1: small.".

1274
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:49,609
Speaker 1: Well, I guess what's interesting is the-- They want a filter on there so they don't have to sit there.

1275
01:05:49,870 --> 01:05:56,190
Speaker 0: There was a really good kind of way around that that disappeared with the advent of tablets and laptops and smartphones and everything.

1276
01:05:56,933 --> 01:06:02,030
Speaker 0: You know, back in the day, the family had one computer hooked up to a modem, so it was probably in the kitchen because not everyone had a den.

1277
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:03,109
Speaker 1: Maybe it was in the den.

1278
01:06:03,331 --> 01:06:03,775
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

1279
01:06:03,795 --> 01:06:04,642
Speaker 1: It's in a public space.

1280
01:06:04,662 --> 01:06:05,570
Speaker 1: It's not in someone's bedroom.

1281
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:08,290
Speaker 0: So the kid would be there and the parents would kind of just always be around.

1282
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:18,790
Speaker 0: Of course, I remember the first thing I typed when I had access to the internet was literally-- I typed the words "bomb-making instructions" in front of my entire extended family and hit enter, and bomb-making instructions came up.

1283
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:20,525
Speaker 0: My dad was like, "I

1284
01:06:20,585 --> 01:06:20,928
Speaker 0: figured.".

1285
01:06:21,251 --> 01:06:22,198
Speaker 0: My mom was like, "Don't hurt

1286
01:06:22,218 --> 01:06:22,661
Speaker 0: yourself.".

1287
01:06:24,615 --> 01:06:26,489
Speaker 1: Well, that's because our families aren't, you know.

1288
01:06:26,810 --> 01:06:28,223
Speaker 0: But I guess, is there value in that?

1289
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:34,130
Speaker 0: Should we fault a parent who installs some filtering for their kid?

1290
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:45,470
Speaker 0: Or do we take the radical techno-progressivist-- The thing is, I mean-- This is a future where information is so available that it's impossible to filter and all you can do is provide context.

1291
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:45,992
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like.

1292
01:06:46,032 --> 01:06:54,630
Speaker 1: you can if you want, and it might, you know, delay the kid finding the prong, but it almost, it's sort of like the story of the kids of the toy guns, right?

1293
01:06:54,790 --> 01:06:59,010
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, you would go to one kid's house and there's tons of plastic guns everywhere.

1294
01:07:00,071 --> 01:07:04,030
Speaker 1: And then some kid visits and his mom doesn't, you know, his parents don't let him have any toy guns.

1295
01:07:04,030 --> 01:07:05,130
Speaker 1: We all do a kid like that.

1296
01:07:05,710 --> 01:07:08,929
Speaker 1: And when that kid shows up at the house, he's like, "Oh my god, toy

1297
01:07:08,969 --> 01:07:09,170
Speaker 1: guns!".

1298
01:07:09,211 --> 01:07:10,750
Speaker 1: He's going crazy over the toy guns.

1299
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:13,829
Speaker 1: Because they're banned, he becomes fascinated with them.

1300
01:07:14,212 --> 01:07:15,525
Speaker 1: And they're just like, "Oh my god, it's the best thing

1301
01:07:15,606 --> 01:07:15,748
Speaker 1: ever.".

1302
01:07:16,070 --> 01:07:19,370
Speaker 1: Whereas if they're just all over the place, the kids are like, "Yeah, toy guns, whatever.

1303
01:07:20,352 --> 01:07:20,739
Speaker 1: What's your

1304
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:21,025
Speaker 1: problem?"

1305
01:07:21,086 --> 01:07:21,310
Speaker 1: Right?

1306
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:22,910
Speaker 1: And it's sort of the same thing.

1307
01:07:22,950 --> 01:07:30,930
Speaker 1: If you put up this big banning thing and your kid notices, like, that there's something you're hiding from him, he's going to be mad curious and want to find whatever that is.

1308
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:39,150
Speaker 1: I am not confident that any parent- I think I would bet that a kid would find porn faster if there was blocking installed than if there wasn't.

1309
01:07:39,270 --> 01:07:43,310
Speaker 1: He just wouldn't have any curiosity to find the porn and it'd be longer until he found it by accident.

1310
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:44,110
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm not even confident?

1311
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:54,030
Speaker 1: But if there was a block in, if there was some sort of software preventing him, he would, then he would notice, as soon as he noticed that blocking software, he would do every effort to find the prongs and find it because the blocking software isn't perfect.

1312
01:07:54,030 --> 01:08:02,090
Speaker 0: I am not confident that there's any parent in the history of the world who would be able to outsmart their kids when it comes to blocking content on a computer.

1313
01:08:02,090 --> 01:08:02,733
Speaker 1: Yeah, even me.

1314
01:08:02,794 --> 01:08:05,809
Speaker 1: I wouldn't, if I had kids, I wouldn't be able to prevent them if they really, you know, it's impossible.

1315
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:09,390
Speaker 0: I mean, I already don't understand Homestock, so I guess I'm already getting old.

1316
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:15,910
Speaker 1: But, you know, I sort of feel like, you know, in general, parenting, right?

1317
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:19,267
Speaker 1: It's like, why even, what's even wrong if a kid sees porn?

1318
01:08:19,287 --> 01:08:19,870
Speaker 1: What's the problem?

1319
01:08:20,951 --> 01:08:22,270
Speaker 0: Well, maybe that's it, I guess.

1320
01:08:22,649 --> 01:08:28,810
Speaker 1: But even if there is a problem, it's like, well, look, no amount of blocking is really going to prevent it.

1321
01:08:29,069 --> 01:08:31,729
Speaker 1: So really, it's sort of the same, my same feeling on privacy.

1322
01:08:31,830 --> 01:08:34,465
Speaker 1: It's like, look, you can't keep your information secret.

1323
01:08:34,505 --> 01:08:35,410
Speaker 1: It'll be impossible.

1324
01:08:35,770 --> 01:08:36,210
Speaker 0: Well, this is it.

1325
01:08:36,310 --> 01:08:40,590
Speaker 0: So just give in to the fact that it's- Content filters of any kind only work in a walled garden.

1326
01:08:40,729 --> 01:08:43,850
Speaker 0: Now, in a place like China, it works because they made the whole thing one gigantic walled garden.

1327
01:08:43,930 --> 01:08:55,229
Speaker 1: It's like, just give in to the fact that it's impossible to block, and instead, your best bet is to have some other strategy, which is raise a kid who's not going to become one of those people who looks at porn in the freaking courthouse.

1328
01:08:56,330 --> 01:08:56,652
Speaker 1: Right?

1329
01:08:56,772 --> 01:09:00,149
Speaker 1: Raise a kid who's only going to look at porn when appropriate or not at all.

1330
01:09:06,029 --> 01:09:08,149
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1331
01:09:08,330 --> 01:09:13,290
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1332
01:09:13,671 --> 01:09:18,710

1333
01:09:19,090 --> 01:09:21,630
Speaker 0: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

1334
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:26,370
Speaker 0: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1336
01:09:31,189 --> 01:09:34,149
Speaker 1: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1337
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:37,310
Speaker 1: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
