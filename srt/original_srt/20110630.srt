00:00:56,817 --> 00:00:57,560
Speaker 0: It's on Netflix streaming.

19
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,088
Speaker 0: You're just watching.

20
00:00:58,108 --> 00:00:58,840
Speaker 1: I know what it's about.

21
00:00:59,061 --> 00:01:00,446
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's about.

22
00:01:00,506 --> 00:01:11,948
Speaker 0: for those of you who don't know a young boy in a poor, you know Northern British mining town during all the troubles and the strikes and everything and very kind of you know Blue-collar working-class people.

23
00:01:11,968 --> 00:01:18,511
Speaker 0: his dad wants him to do boxing, but he wants to do ballet So he sneaks away from boxing lessons and gets ballet lessons.

24
00:01:18,531 --> 00:01:19,514
Speaker 0: He's super good at it.

25
00:01:19,835 --> 00:01:21,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, and that causes havoc.

26
00:01:22,063 --> 00:01:22,887
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I don't think he's.

27
00:01:23,068 --> 00:01:23,873
Speaker 1: he's not gay though.

28
00:01:23,893 --> 00:01:25,782
Speaker 1: He just like he just likes ballet He's not.

29
00:01:25,822 --> 00:01:28,311
Speaker 0: he just really likes ballet like figure skaters.

30
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:36,013
Speaker 0: So we're watching the movie and he has a friend who is gay and one thing leads to another and the movies like at its climax were like the super happy.

31
00:01:36,053 --> 00:01:39,864
Speaker 0: like everything is great music is playing and Just as that music starts.

32
00:01:40,165 --> 00:01:43,637
Speaker 0: We all get text messages from people that are like gay marriages past.

33
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:45,963
Speaker 0: Yeah So we.

34
00:01:46,043 --> 00:01:51,631
Speaker 0: so we're standing there like turning on the news to see what's going on while the hurrah We won music is playing from Billy Elliot.

35
00:01:51,651 --> 00:01:52,234
Speaker 0: It was pretty funny.

36
00:01:52,254 --> 00:01:54,962
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Then we're like.

37
00:01:55,043 --> 00:02:00,879
Speaker 0: and then I saw someone on FARC said they just turned on pink lights on the Empire State Building and I was like bullshit.

38
00:02:01,901 --> 00:02:03,489
Speaker 0: So I went up on the roof like oh maybe.

39
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,057
Speaker 0: and then there was foggy so I couldn't see.

40
00:02:05,077 --> 00:02:05,117
Speaker 0: so.

41
00:02:06,405 --> 00:02:07,150
Speaker 0: And then I was like, wait a minute.

42
00:02:07,171 --> 00:02:07,694
Speaker 0: It was foggy.

43
00:02:07,714 --> 00:02:08,419
Speaker 0: Then how would they see?

44
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,025
Speaker 1: Actually, they had rainbow lights.

45
00:02:10,104 --> 00:02:14,620
Speaker 1: The rainbow lights were left over from something they did previously for something else.

46
00:02:16,743 --> 00:02:19,720
Speaker 0: On the next day - if you got him smoke him or light him.

47
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:25,215
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure that by now the Empire State Building is every possible conceivable light color configuration.

48
00:02:25,235 --> 00:02:26,880
Speaker 1: Yeah of red orange yellow.

49
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:31,700
Speaker 0: I do very much enjoy whenever I see it up in colors and I don't recognize what the deal is.

50
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,940
Speaker 0: I always like to look up and see like oh it's because of whatever.

51
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:34,987
Speaker 0: well always something weird.

52
00:02:35,047 --> 00:02:42,700
Speaker 1: the problem is is I went to the website and Like once and I just went on the entire list because they have it scheduled in advance except for special.

53
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,579
Speaker 0: I've done that but I've forgotten some of the things that they'll do it for.

54
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,929
Speaker 0: then I remember when I see the colors like all right It's green because of st.

55
00:02:50,312 --> 00:02:51,277
Speaker 0: Patrick's Day or whatever.

56
00:02:51,518 --> 00:02:56,215
Speaker 1: Yeah I like it when it's sports teams winning except as long as it's not Yankees or Jets.

57
00:02:56,536 --> 00:02:59,367
Speaker 1: Yankees aren't that bad They're basically the evil team.

58
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,914
Speaker 0: you ever seen damn Yankees.

59
00:03:01,316 --> 00:03:04,211
Speaker 1: you ever seen Shallon soccer, you know the?

60
00:03:04,231 --> 00:03:06,746
Speaker 1: you know, the evil is full of steroids That's the Yankees.

61
00:03:07,068 --> 00:03:08,839
Speaker 0: I point out that we went to our IT.

62
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,086
Speaker 0: We were the evil team.

63
00:03:11,467 --> 00:03:13,855
Speaker 1: We rooted for the evil team over the evil team.

64
00:03:14,517 --> 00:03:15,640
Speaker 1: nor was I on the evil team.

65
00:03:17,301 --> 00:03:18,834
Speaker 0: RIT hockey was the evil team.

66
00:03:18,935 --> 00:03:20,342
Speaker 1: I was not Scott.

67
00:03:20,362 --> 00:03:21,448
Speaker 0: we were in the corner crew.

68
00:03:21,508 --> 00:03:23,679
Speaker 0: We were basically the stooges of the evil team.

69
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:25,467
Speaker 1: Hey when you in Mighty Ducks, right?

70
00:03:25,628 --> 00:03:27,535
Speaker 1: No one no one's cheering for the evil team.

71
00:03:27,556 --> 00:03:28,540
Speaker 0: I was sharing to the evil team.

72
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:29,463
Speaker 1: What the fuck.

73
00:03:29,663 --> 00:03:34,579
Speaker 1: because they way no one in the movie was cheering for the evil team except the evil team, right?

74
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,940
Speaker 0: Of course, there was no cheering allowed in that evil team, but I'm just saying it's like evil teams don't have fans.

75
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,251
Speaker 0: So if you so Yankees have fans, those aren't fans.

76
00:03:44,271 --> 00:03:44,953
Speaker 1: They're not even human.

77
00:03:45,153 --> 00:03:47,481
Speaker 0: I Don't know.

78
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:51,719
Speaker 0: I always think of that one South Park where the Detroit Red Wings play against those kindergarteners.

79
00:03:53,225 --> 00:03:54,933
Speaker 0: I was rooting for the Red Wings in that game.

80
00:03:54,953 --> 00:03:56,640
Speaker 1: Did you're alone in that?

81
00:03:59,103 --> 00:04:01,000
Speaker 0: So it's Thursday, it's the lounge.

Speaker 1: This Google technology stuff this gaming stuff.

102
00:05:11,489 --> 00:05:14,640
Speaker 0: I got a lot to say about Google+ but it's not the time for that.

103
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,463
Speaker 1: There's anime stuff.

104
00:05:15,503 --> 00:05:17,049
Speaker 1: I can't say anything about it cuz I haven't used it.

105
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:18,454
Speaker 0: I've looked at it.

106
00:05:19,117 --> 00:05:19,839
Speaker 1: Okay, sure.

107
00:05:21,462 --> 00:05:23,171
Speaker 1: So, you know I'm gonna save that for the other days.

108
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:24,840
Speaker 1: so what's there to talk about today?

109
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,072
Speaker 1: Yeah, not much, but I did notice is a strange coincidence.

110
00:05:28,132 --> 00:05:32,847
Speaker 1: There seemed to be a lot of sales At the same time, huh?

111
00:05:32,927 --> 00:05:39,570
Speaker 1: Well threadless and I think it's related to the 4th of July Like they know that people are home on their computers.

112
00:05:39,831 --> 00:05:42,300
Speaker 1: So all the digital stores are having big discounts, right?

113
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,139
Speaker 1: There's a big steam sale is a big threadless sale.

114
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:55,529
Speaker 0: I'm sure that Had a sale because I've never bought anything on threadless unless they were doing their $10 sale or Anoth was buying me as many shirts.

115
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,434
Speaker 0: I wanted for free.

116
00:05:56,595 --> 00:06:03,160
Speaker 1: Yeah But the point is this if you want to buy t-shirts and or vidya games now's the time.

117
00:06:03,542 --> 00:06:12,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, the biggest thing on steam I look through there's nothing I really wanted but There's a square Enix idos pack at 75 bucks for life.

118
00:06:13,684 --> 00:06:17,540
Speaker 1: Best deal ever if that's your thing, it's like I didn't want any of those games really.

119
00:06:18,222 --> 00:06:25,547
Speaker 1: But if you wanted those games not even those if you are saving like three you're getting basically getting over $300 worth of games for nothing.

120
00:06:25,587 --> 00:06:30,964
Speaker 0: Yeah, I put it this way if you want even one if you want more than one game That's in that pack.

121
00:06:30,984 --> 00:06:31,467
Speaker 0: You might as well.

122
00:06:31,548 --> 00:06:34,851
Speaker 1: Well, no because I mean it you're still paying $75.

123
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:40,100
Speaker 0: if you want even one game in the pack, that means that you probably like the kinds of games they make.

124
00:06:40,762 --> 00:06:42,408
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're probably gonna play some of those.

125
00:06:42,448 --> 00:06:44,857
Speaker 1: let's let's look what's in this $75 pack.

126
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:45,239
Speaker 1: Hold on.

127
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:45,520
Speaker 1: Let's see.

128
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:52,638
Speaker 0: So man, there was a time when I paid $70 for Zelda 2, okay So there's that Batman game which a lot of people like I already own.

129
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:53,322

136
00:07:08,635 --> 00:07:10,080
Speaker 1: No, everyone knows about it.

137
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,647

154
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:59,008
Speaker 1: Anyway, that's a ton of games that are a lot of monies But you're only paying 75.

155
00:07:59,008 --> 00:08:04,155
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll wait cuz you know what two years from now I'll buy a pack that has that and more for like ten bucks.

00:08:04,336 --> 00:08:07,146
Speaker 1: I know right But I don't even want.

157
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,553
Speaker 1: I don't even want any of these games like.

00:08:08,593 --> 00:08:09,940
Speaker 1: even if I bought him when would I play them?

159
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,090
Speaker 0: This is something that's been happening a lot to me.

160
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,216
Speaker 0: Like it wasn't that long ago.

161
00:08:13,236 --> 00:08:13,900
Speaker 0: I was on Amazon.

162
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,805
Speaker 0: I was looking for.

163
00:08:14,825 --> 00:08:15,930
Speaker 0: I wanted to buy like I was.

164
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:19,044
Speaker 0: you know, whatever you finish an Amazon order You sit there like.

165
00:08:19,084 --> 00:08:20,308
Speaker 0: is there anything else I need?

166
00:08:20,448 --> 00:08:21,752
Speaker 0: Yep anything.

167
00:08:21,893 --> 00:08:22,093
Speaker 0: Yep.

168
00:08:22,154 --> 00:08:24,100
Speaker 0: So I looked at anime and I sorted by price.

169
00:08:24,582 --> 00:08:40,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, and gonkotsuo, which is a fantastic like b-plus show It would have been an a-minus if the ending wasn't stupid Was like 18 bucks for the whole box set and a deal and I added to my cart and then I thought I was like, ah 18 bucks.

170
00:08:41,422 --> 00:08:41,842
Speaker 1: Well, it was.

171
00:08:41,884 --> 00:08:42,426
Speaker 0: that's like.

172
00:08:42,787 --> 00:08:44,373
Speaker 1: it's not so much the $18.

173
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:46,140
Speaker 1: It's that I'm never going to watch this.

174
00:08:46,743 --> 00:08:49,897
Speaker 0: I would possibly watch it one more time at some point in the future.

175
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:54,640
Speaker 0: and more importantly I only buy DVDs if I'm lending them to people and that's the show I could lend to people.

176
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:57,755
Speaker 0: There are people I could think of who I'd be like, hey, you should watch this.

177
00:08:58,077 --> 00:08:58,519
Speaker 0: Here you go.

178
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:05,799
Speaker 0: But then I imagined 18 bucks And I realized that's like one steak dinner and I just I didn't buy it.

179
00:09:06,341 --> 00:09:06,623
Speaker 1: You know what?

180
00:09:06,683 --> 00:09:09,093
Speaker 1: I did buy an Amazon for a lot more than 18 bucks.

181
00:09:09,434 --> 00:09:10,920
Speaker 0: Happy steak dinner, but it's a steak dinner.

182
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:12,516
Speaker 1: Finally, we've been waiting right?

183
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,550
Speaker 1: Disco tech license both these movies and they're finally released.

184
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:20,947
Speaker 1: Galaxy Express 3 9 movie and I do Galaxy Movie.

185
00:09:21,088 --> 00:09:23,815
Speaker 0: when we get this we're gonna watch him and do some shows on that Yep.

186
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,452
Speaker 1: So I ordered both DVDs even though they were like 15 bucks each.

187
00:09:27,773 --> 00:09:30,163
Speaker 0: so Rose we never did a show on 3 9 Did we?

188
00:09:30,545 --> 00:09:31,894
Speaker 1: I don't know but it doesn't matter.

189
00:09:31,914 --> 00:09:35,115
Speaker 0: in the very least I want to do a show just on the 3 9 movie.

190
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:38,383
Speaker 0: Yeah independent of the show Independent of any other.

191
00:09:38,785 --> 00:09:42,656
Speaker 1: lazy Matsumoto do plenty of Matsumoto in this in the future.

192
00:09:42,677 --> 00:09:46,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course We got a. I'm rocking through fist of the North Star.

193
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:57,863
Speaker 0: I hit this point where I was like cuz you know when you watch a show that it like sometimes you watch a show any Show and or any media that you're consuming even games you get to a point where you almost feel like it's a chore Especially.

194
00:09:57,883 --> 00:09:59,815
Speaker 1: no, not really only if it sucks.

195
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:03,120
Speaker 1: Yeah If it's good, I have a strong desire.

196
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:08,040
Speaker 1: That's pretty much how I can tell us something I like or not is if I have a strong desire to keep going.

197
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:08,281
Speaker 1: Yep.

198
00:10:08,362 --> 00:10:09,708
Speaker 0: Well, I realized this like what was?

199
00:10:09,768 --> 00:10:10,753
Speaker 0: I was watching some show.

200
00:10:10,813 --> 00:10:12,160
Speaker 0: I think Oh cos they know you Jim.

201
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,320
Speaker 0: But I was like, I'm gonna watch the show cuz it was pretty good and then we'll do a show on it.

202
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,267
Speaker 0: I'll get Scott to watch it and I after like six episodes I'd like didn't really care about the seventh episode.

203
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:31,920
Speaker 0: and then not that long after I watched like I think it was Ava again And I just remember watching one episode me like, oh, right I watched like the whole show in a couple days like you can't help yourself, right?

204
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,685
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I started I was I've been watching.

205
00:10:33,705 --> 00:10:34,588
Speaker 1: oh, dude.

206
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:35,792
Speaker 1: I saw something.

207
00:10:35,912 --> 00:10:40,060
Speaker 1: That's a short show - it's almost 11 episodes But they're long like selling movies.

208
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,080
Speaker 0: I've only seen two movies and the first episode because cops who showed it to me way back.

209
00:10:44,221 --> 00:10:47,380
Speaker 1: I've seen now 11 episodes and the two movies.

210
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:54,373
Speaker 1: But there's a third movie and is two or three TV specials and some side spin-off One of which is a Muroi special.

211
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:55,640
Speaker 0: once I see the best character.

212
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,799
Speaker 0: I have a strong suspicion that the first movie is the best of all of it.

213
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:03,005
Speaker 1: I The TV shows pretty good.

214
00:11:03,106 --> 00:11:06,198
Speaker 0: It is but that movie is too but concentrated Lee.

215
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,082
Speaker 0: Awesome Yeah, pretty.

216
00:11:07,102 --> 00:11:10,773
Speaker 0: remember that scene at the end where he's on the roof and the music's playing and smoke.

217
00:11:11,215 --> 00:11:11,496
Speaker 1: Yeah.

218
00:11:11,576 --> 00:11:11,957
Speaker 1: Yeah.

219
00:11:12,017 --> 00:11:15,531
Speaker 1: Yeah Oh my god, and it's a DS game, which I just got.

220
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:16,254
Speaker 1: what you can't read.

221
00:11:16,274 --> 00:11:17,439
Speaker 0: Yeah, Scott hands me his DS.

222
00:11:17,701 --> 00:11:18,928
Speaker 0: He's like check this out.

223
00:11:18,948 --> 00:11:19,833
Speaker 0: I'm like, what is it?

224
00:11:19,853 --> 00:11:20,960
Speaker 0: He won't even tell me anything.

225
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:28,211
Speaker 0: He's like just wait just wait and then I hear Man all right.

226
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:29,322
Speaker 1: All right But yeah, it's.

227
00:11:29,542 --> 00:11:33,760
Speaker 1: I'm just saying that's an example of something where I watched one and I can't help but watch the next one.

228
00:11:34,063 --> 00:11:35,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, so fist of the North Star.

229
00:11:35,581 --> 00:11:38,174
Speaker 0: I was like that and then it petered out like in the middle of the fur.

230
00:11:38,214 --> 00:11:39,400
Speaker 0: the very first story arcs.

231
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,553
Speaker 0: I was doing other stuff and I can't watch it while I'm doing something else.

232
00:11:43,055 --> 00:11:54,284
Speaker 1: and really for me a Peter the only time I was slow was After the first story arc ended and the second one began and everything went like back to like, you know with the base level I was sort of like,

233
00:11:54,828 --> 00:11:55,734
Speaker 0: uh, so see what got but

234
00:11:55,754 --> 00:11:56,660
Speaker 1: then it built up again.

235
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:04,766
Speaker 0: It did this weird Peter out and then he got close to King Sama Like it was like alright He's actually gonna go get that bastard.

236
00:12:05,047 --> 00:12:08,480
Speaker 0: and then I just watched like every episode and then the next arc.

237
00:12:08,941 --> 00:12:21,546
Speaker 1: I was about to Peter out and then South Star swallow fist came and I was like, yeah Yes, that's the thing is that beginning of the second arc is a little bit slow But as soon as Ray shows up, you're like, yeah, BAM And then the toll show.

238
00:12:21,566 --> 00:12:23,397
Speaker 1: from then on there is no slowing down.

239
00:12:23,438 --> 00:12:26,591
Speaker 1: cuz you know Kenshiro has that no different recap episodes that you skip.

240
00:12:26,611 --> 00:12:28,920
Speaker 0: like there's the noise that happens when the guys about to explode.

241
00:12:29,221 --> 00:12:37,879
Speaker 0: I like how every power like different style has a different sound before a guy explodes or falls apart or whatever like that weird background like.

242
00:12:39,522 --> 00:12:42,840
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's not Wednesday, that's enough anime but stuff's on sale.

243
00:12:43,241 --> 00:12:44,406
Speaker 1: Yeah, bye.

244
00:12:44,546 --> 00:12:46,112
Speaker 1: It's time to empty your wallets people.

245
00:12:46,695 --> 00:12:48,040
Speaker 1: It's the economy's not doing too good.

246
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:53,437
Speaker 1: Yeah, we got we have to shut down professional sports leagues possibly shut down government.

247
00:12:53,477 --> 00:12:54,320
Speaker 1: Everything's shutting down.

248
00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:56,175
Speaker 1: Yeah, luckily, so we don't want.

249
00:12:56,215 --> 00:12:58,864
Speaker 0: the thing is He's not shutting down.

250
00:12:58,884 --> 00:13:02,214
Speaker 1: That's right, but we'll be okay as long as steam doesn't shut down.

251
00:13:02,254 --> 00:13:02,976
Speaker 1: So bye games.

252
00:13:03,598 --> 00:13:05,589
Speaker 1: Oh my god We'll be alright if steam shut down.

253
00:13:09,365 --> 00:13:12,695
Speaker 0: Okay, because I just got Galaga yeah, and I have not played it out.

254
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:14,320
Speaker 1: we Xbox live can't shut down either.

255
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,120
Speaker 1: So by Xbox games like Galaga legions DX it just came out if you don't buy your fool.

256
00:13:18,441 --> 00:13:28,820
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna talk about an aspect of this problem that we haven't talked about Because we've already said a lot of the things that many of you will expect us to say on this issue.

257
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,116
Speaker 0: So don't Scott don't interrupt me with uh, but we've already talked about this.

258
00:13:33,156 --> 00:13:34,160
Speaker 0: cuz I'm gonna skip all that bullshit.

259
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:49,129
Speaker 0: There's an article here and there's a lot of follow-up articles about the fact that there's a skills gap in America where GV never discussed this before where unemployment is very high yet simultaneously Many many places that are desperate to hire.

260
00:13:49,169 --> 00:13:51,397
Speaker 0: people are unable to find anyone qualified.

261
00:13:51,417 --> 00:13:53,953
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I thought you're talking about a gaming skills cap.

262
00:13:54,558 --> 00:14:00,064
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah before the show I was like, I'm gonna talk about the skills gap and Scott was like what the fuck We've talked about that.

263
00:14:00,084 --> 00:14:05,986
Speaker 0: Like it's like talking about the gaming skills cap like every Skills gap in the real world.

264
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:06,728
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

265
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:08,915
Speaker 1: You think it's related to the gaming skills cap.

266
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,139
Speaker 0: No, I don't think so.

267
00:14:10,562 --> 00:14:12,120
Speaker 1: I'm sure there are some fundamental principles.

268
00:14:13,226 --> 00:14:14,420
Speaker 0: So here's the deal.

269
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:24,115
Speaker 0: We already know that there's this problem of huge unemployment and we know that we have this problem where there's a very large unskilled workforce in the US and it's a big problem.

270
00:14:24,135 --> 00:14:26,909
Speaker 1: I wouldn't say it's unskilled I would just say it's.

271
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:34,315
Speaker 1: I would say this some portion is on Some portion is low and some portion is maybe skilled but in areas that are not valuable.

272
00:14:34,395 --> 00:14:36,601
Speaker 0: No, no, no, that's not it Mm-hmm.

273
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:42,760
Speaker 0: So according to this article and a couple other articles I found are these articles backed by studies or these just editorials?

274
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:49,800
Speaker 0: Uh, it's anecdotes from people trying to hire and then demographic information and it's like a hodgepodge of research from places.

275
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,826
Speaker 1: It's an article.

276
00:14:51,028 --> 00:14:51,571
Speaker 0: It's an angle.

277
00:14:51,611 --> 00:14:52,537
Speaker 0: I hadn't thought of before.

278
00:14:52,738 --> 00:14:52,980
Speaker 1: All right.

279
00:14:53,161 --> 00:14:56,034
Speaker 0: So the deal is that and I've had this I mean my company.

280
00:14:56,074 --> 00:14:59,207
Speaker 0: we were trying to hire people forever And it's it's hard to hire people that are.

281
00:14:59,227 --> 00:15:00,653
Speaker 0: when we interviewed was like.

282
00:15:01,075 --> 00:15:02,219
Speaker 0: it's like why'd you even come in?

283
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,906
Speaker 0: Like I'd look at their resume.

284
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:05,593
Speaker 0: I'd pick any word on it and be like.

285
00:15:05,854 --> 00:15:08,244
Speaker 0: so tell me about this and they just like be Daring headlights.

286
00:15:08,305 --> 00:15:10,074
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't understand the lying on resumes.

287
00:15:10,094 --> 00:15:11,260
Speaker 1: That's a different issue entirely.

288
00:15:11,461 --> 00:15:14,499
Speaker 1: Well, but I mean in general it is really hard at least, you know.

289
00:15:16,362 --> 00:15:20,796
Speaker 0: If someone who say use the ticketing system put that on their resume like familiarity with.

290
00:15:21,117 --> 00:15:29,520
Speaker 0: but if I ask them About it and they can't tell me anything Yeah, anything at all, I mean there are people who literally apply to programming jobs.

291
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:38,580
Speaker 1: You can't write fizzbuzz, which is a very simple program, you know Which you anyone any CS major who got went through cs1 should be able to trivially write fizzbuzz.

292
00:15:38,681 --> 00:15:39,689
Speaker 0: I've never heard of fizzbuzz.

293
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,000
Speaker 1: fizzbuzz is pretty simple.

294
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:45,713
Speaker 1: All you do is loop through numbers, you know X through Y and every single number.

295
00:15:45,753 --> 00:15:48,079
Speaker 1: you print out the number then you print a space.

296
00:15:49,103 --> 00:15:50,086
Speaker 1: Well, you print a space.

297
00:15:50,126 --> 00:15:50,828
Speaker 0: Okay, so far.

298
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:58,252
Speaker 1: This is one line in Perl right if the number is evenly divisible by three so one line you print out the word fizz still one line.

299
00:15:58,473 --> 00:16:01,063
Speaker 1: and if it's divisible by five you print out the Word buzz.

300
00:16:01,365 --> 00:16:06,467
Speaker 1: and if it's divisible by three and five you print out fizzbuzz Still one line.

301
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:16,885
Speaker 1: So this program basically forces you to do a iteration B modulus math C string formatting on output flow control Depending on you really.

302
00:16:16,905 --> 00:16:20,560
Speaker 1: but I mean that's basically the three things you have to know in order to write this program.

303
00:16:20,661 --> 00:16:21,593
Speaker 1: It's a trivial program.

304
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:27,579
Speaker 0: this way It could be slow control in that you could write this in basic with a loop that has if if in it.

305
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,677
Speaker 1: If you really wanted it's mostly about getting the string formatting exactly right with your print statements.

306
00:16:31,878 --> 00:16:34,347
Speaker 0: Yeah Really people couldn't.

307
00:16:34,467 --> 00:16:41,794
Speaker 1: there are people who apply for programming jobs who cannot write that program, you know I don't the line but let's skip past the lying and resumes go to the skill gap.

308
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:42,778
Speaker 0: Okay, so the skill gap?

309
00:16:42,978 --> 00:16:47,540
Speaker 0: so we People who need highly skilled workers cannot find them.

310
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,740
Speaker 1: That's why highly skilled workers are demanding even more and more money despite a shitty economy.

311
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:59,599
Speaker 0: Simultaneously, there's this huge like Proportion of the economy that needs low skill work.

312
00:16:59,901 --> 00:17:17,878
Speaker 0: Yeah now as in people who aren't experts at any particular thing But they need people who can write an email with reasonable grammar and spelling keep track of a small number of simple tasks, maybe handle a calendar do trivial clerical work and Many people are not qualified to do this work either

313
00:17:18,348 --> 00:17:18,760
Speaker 1: Really?

314
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:24,817
Speaker 0: so the problem is that we have the majority of the jobs that people are trying to hire right now.

315
00:17:24,896 --> 00:17:26,343
Speaker 0: if you forget the super High-skilled.

316
00:17:26,363 --> 00:17:28,957
Speaker 0: high-end are moderate to low-skilled jobs.

317
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:32,840
Speaker 0: yet The majority of our education system does not prepare people for that.

318
00:17:33,201 --> 00:17:38,700
Speaker 0: It prepares people who have money for the high-end and it prepares people who don't have money for nothing.

319
00:17:39,744 --> 00:17:43,180
Speaker 0: It prepares them for no-skill jobs, which aren't in demand anymore.

320
00:17:43,923 --> 00:17:52,717
Speaker 0: So we've got the situation where there are people who literally have no marketable skills Yep, other than they're a warm body and there aren't enough jobs for those people.

321
00:17:52,918 --> 00:17:53,580
Speaker 0: yet simultaneously

322
00:17:53,620 --> 00:18:04,368
Speaker 1: The thing is if I needed a job that wasn't the highest skilled job, right if I need the calendar task managing guy And I can't find anyone who can already do it I'll just interview people to find someone who's nice

323
00:18:04,628 --> 00:18:05,370
Speaker 0: and then just train them

324
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,032
Speaker 1: and train them.

325
00:18:06,413 --> 00:18:08,278
Speaker 0: Ah, so here's what's really going on.

326
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:11,720
Speaker 0: first Companies are unwilling to train people anymore.

327
00:18:11,961 --> 00:18:16,696
Speaker 1: Well, you know we could the government could solve that if they've had some sort of tax incentive for training.

328
00:18:16,756 --> 00:18:20,159
Speaker 1: like all your tax money You spend on training is tax exempt or something like that.

329
00:18:20,283 --> 00:18:28,647
Speaker 0: Yeah Two people who are in school are basically told by everyone at every turn that if you don't get a degree from a university You're fucked.

330
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:29,311
Speaker 1: They're lying.

331
00:18:29,714 --> 00:18:41,880
Speaker 0: Yes, they're lying but as a result There aren't people going into vocational programs and a lot of federal and state money that used to prop those programs up has been disappearing Quietly for a long time, you know what plumbers make mad money.

332
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,080
Speaker 1: They make a lot more money than guy who you know manages a calendar.

333
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:52,140
Speaker 0: Simultaneously a lot of people because they're told to have to get a degree Get huge student loans and get degrees and can't pay them off.

334
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,560
Speaker 0: They get degrees in highly skilled arenas that are not in demand.

335
00:18:56,122 --> 00:19:04,172
Speaker 0: So on the job market they are qualified for jobs that don't exist Yep, and they are qualified for these middle and low skill job.

336
00:19:04,493 --> 00:19:05,296
Speaker 1: people go to college.

337
00:19:05,376 --> 00:19:06,279
Speaker 1: I don't know what I want to do.

338
00:19:07,244 --> 00:19:08,471
Speaker 1: I'll get a liberal arts degree.

339
00:19:08,552 --> 00:19:09,899
Speaker 1: You might as well have gotten no degree.

340
00:19:10,401 --> 00:19:15,579
Speaker 0: But these people are very qualified to do a lot of these middle and low skill jobs that aren't actually very high demand.

341
00:19:15,639 --> 00:19:24,560
Speaker 0: people are Having a lot of trouble hiring people for these positions, but because those people have crippling student loan debt They can't afford to work the low skill job because it doesn't pay enough.

342
00:19:24,842 --> 00:19:27,500
Speaker 1: But if they'd gone to but the thing is I don't understand, right?

343
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,660
Speaker 1: So let's say I spent a lot and I went to a fancy school and I got a history degree.

344
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:36,680
Speaker 1: Yep, and I'm not gonna be history professor and I can be a history teacher and I got a big-ass loan.

345
00:19:37,205 --> 00:19:38,600
Speaker 1: I need a job that can pay off this big.

346
00:19:38,721 --> 00:19:41,234
Speaker 0: I see you've already made the mistake of getting a big-ass loan mistake.

347
00:19:41,254 --> 00:19:44,745
Speaker 1: I can't Can't undo it, right?

348
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:50,488
Speaker 1: I could go and get that job as an office clerk I think which I'm qualified for.

349
00:19:50,528 --> 00:19:59,758
Speaker 1: I think a lot of people for stupid reasons like pride don't do that Which is and it's probably that job would not be enough to pay off the student loan, but it's still more than zero, right?

350
00:20:00,581 --> 00:20:03,873
Speaker 1: It's either that job, which isn't enough or nothing.

351
00:20:04,154 --> 00:20:05,960
Speaker 1: It's like why would I choose the nothing?

352
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,763
Speaker 1: I know I can't get.

353
00:20:07,784 --> 00:20:13,380
Speaker 1: I tried I would continue to try even while working that that subpar job to get a better job.

354
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:17,445
Speaker 1: Well, here's to see if something opens up even if I can't get one It's better to.

355
00:20:17,486 --> 00:20:19,240
Speaker 1: at least it's better to work at Starbucks.

356
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:27,960
Speaker 0: I make something even if all those people did that they are a tiny portion of the real economy and that there's this huge Just massive people who don't have any marketable skills.

357
00:20:28,502 --> 00:20:31,251
Speaker 0: No one is willing to train them or give them these skills.

358
00:20:31,653 --> 00:20:36,871
Speaker 0: the schooling system doesn't give them these heads for sure And there's really almost no recourse for them.

359
00:20:37,373 --> 00:20:41,387
Speaker 0: and yet simultaneously on the high-skill end No company can hire for crap.

360
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:45,119
Speaker 0: I get job offers on a daily basis because people are desperate for anyone who knows IT.

361
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, and yet I know IT people who can't get jobs.

362
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:52,360
Speaker 1: This is why the next chance I get I'm gonna negotiate which I've never done before.

363
00:20:53,662 --> 00:20:54,204
Speaker 1: I'm too nice.

364
00:20:54,285 --> 00:20:57,339
Speaker 0: I'm also in the process of some of that that I probably won't talk about just yet.

365
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:04,623
Speaker 1: So very briefly basically a lesson if you don't have skills get some Don't you know?

366
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:09,549
Speaker 1: take whatever job you can get even if you have to work at a Home Depot or some shit Temporarily you get.

367
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:10,797
Speaker 1: you get more than zero dollars.

368
00:21:10,858 --> 00:21:11,099
Speaker 1: do it.

369
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,228
Speaker 1: I would do it and see.

370
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:16,460
Speaker 1: if you have skills you can negotiate for more money.

371
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:28,407
Speaker 0: Yep but if you're a young adult who is not yet decided if you're going to go to college if You do some research if you're not going to get a degree that will pay for your student loans You're better

372
00:21:28,548 --> 00:21:30,301
Speaker 1: off or unless if your parents are rich Yeah,

373
00:21:30,542 --> 00:21:38,447
Speaker 0: you're better off not going to college getting a job in one of these middle skill areas while simultaneously Fostering an expertise somewhere else.

374
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:39,390
Speaker 0: This is a good example.

375
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:47,440
Speaker 0: become a clerk at a hospital or a bank Because then you start accruing years of quote experience in the medical field or the financial field.

376
00:21:47,460 --> 00:22:00,720
Speaker 0: There's a huge demand for people who have basic skills You know reading writing simple math being an intelligent person and simultaneously who have some Experience with a very specialized industry even if they don't have degree related to said industry.

377
00:22:00,921 --> 00:22:04,478
Speaker 1: Listen to the TED talk with Mike Rowe and basically forget about.

378
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:06,429
Speaker 1: you know What everyone's told you that you should.

379
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,040
Speaker 1: you know, be what you want to be.

380
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,408
Speaker 1: You can't be what you want to be.

381
00:22:09,548 --> 00:22:13,266
Speaker 1: You'll probably end up poor and start Hey, I wanted to be a rich IT guy.

382
00:22:13,286 --> 00:22:17,160
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, but I mean go, you know, go listen to that TED talk.

383
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,850
Speaker 1: I'm sure it's I was think is the thing of the day.

384
00:22:18,951 --> 00:22:20,360
Speaker 1: once go get a job.

385
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:23,919
Speaker 1: It'll probably be something you never thought you would do but you can make a lot of money at.

386
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:30,860
Speaker 1: you Probably don't didn't grow up wanting to be a carpet installer, but you know what a carpet installers can make tons of money.

387
00:22:31,503 --> 00:22:35,542
Speaker 1: You know, you might not thought you would grow up to be a pig farmer But you know what?

388
00:22:35,643 --> 00:22:37,912
Speaker 1: You can make zillions being a big farmer.

389
00:22:37,972 --> 00:22:39,840
Speaker 0: the quote from the one of the articles that I read.

390
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:48,760
Speaker 0: I think I'll link to this one because the quotes in it Quote we have held on too long to these low-wage low-skill industries and we didn't make a strategic long-term investment in education.

391
00:22:49,482 --> 00:22:52,820
Speaker 1: And he goes on it doesn't help that a lot of the no-skill jobs are outsourced to other countries.

392
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:58,154
Speaker 0: Yeah, but he's saying that America has a huge demand for middle-skill jobs yet.

393
00:22:58,174 --> 00:23:00,300
Speaker 0: We don't prepare anyone for those jobs.

394
00:23:00,361 --> 00:23:09,260
Speaker 0: so there's a dichotomy between Super qualified people and people with effectively in terms of real-world marketable skills zero marketable skills.

395
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:14,940
Speaker 0: They don't exist as far as recruiters are concerned because they literally have nothing to offer and no one's willing to train anyone.

396
00:23:15,242 --> 00:23:16,490
Speaker 1: Yep, it sucks.

397
00:23:17,235 --> 00:23:21,260
Speaker 0: So on a lighter note California told Amazon to fuck off.

398
00:23:22,121 --> 00:23:25,215
Speaker 1: Well, you know well Amazon told California to fuck off.

399
00:23:25,255 --> 00:23:33,030
Speaker 0: well, California basically played a bluff game where they said Yeah We're gonna Change the laws to make sure that you have to pay sales tax.

400
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:37,187
Speaker 1: a lot of states have played this game and Amazon is so Far won every time.

401
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,700
Speaker 1: so I don't know why California thought it was gonna be any different.

402
00:23:40,061 --> 00:23:49,079
Speaker 0: Well here well partly California as we were talking about for the show while Amazon did technically have a business presence there It was small enough to where they can say, you know, what fuck it?

403
00:23:49,742 --> 00:23:57,923
Speaker 1: Well, the only business present they had was affiliates which they have in every state except for states that piss Amazon off by That.

404
00:23:57,943 --> 00:24:02,355
Speaker 0: they had up one like small office in California to whatever but doesn't matter.

405
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:10,080
Speaker 1: basically for those of you who don't know Amazon affiliates is a system where if you link to Amazon, let's say I link to the book club book on our website.

406
00:24:10,223 --> 00:24:10,920
Speaker 0: We need to do that.

407
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:20,520
Speaker 1: By the way, if you click on that link and then you buy the book after clicking on that link Amazon gives us some money for basically being freelance salesmen for them.

408
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,564
Speaker 1: We're selling you books.

409
00:24:21,805 --> 00:24:25,740
Speaker 0: Scott write a script that goes through every link we've ever made to Amazon in terms of the new affiliate link.

410
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:28,532
Speaker 1: Right, but you know, that's that's how Amazon affiliates works.

411
00:24:28,854 --> 00:24:35,560
Speaker 1: So the way the Amazon only charges sales tax in states that require it.

412
00:24:36,022 --> 00:24:47,380
Speaker 1: You know if Amazon has a presence in that state, for example we pay sales tax and Amazon purchases in New York because Amazon has warehouses and distribution centers and other things in the state of New York, right?

413
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:52,449
Speaker 1: Amazon did not physically have any of those things in the state of California For example the gig night star.

414
00:24:53,053 --> 00:24:57,859
Speaker 0: if you live in New York State You have to pay sales taxes that I then remit to the state of New York any other state?

415
00:24:58,241 --> 00:25:09,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, if you but technically if you live in say, Missouri, you are supposed to report that On your you know annual income tax report and pay that to the state.

416
00:25:10,664 --> 00:25:11,655
Speaker 1: Never it doesn't happen.

417
00:25:11,998 --> 00:25:14,226
Speaker 0: So Just give all the details of it.

418
00:25:14,587 --> 00:25:15,872
Speaker 0: Here's what I want to talk about.

419
00:25:15,912 --> 00:25:16,755
Speaker 0: Here's the problem.

420
00:25:16,776 --> 00:25:21,303
Speaker 0: I am we need a Either.

421
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:44,898
Speaker 0: states have to all get together and make collectively an open trivial to interface with Universal system whereby all their sales tax laws Whatever they are are codified such that anyone who's selling anything online or interstate can Trivially do all the taxes automatically without having to research every individual states.

422
00:25:44,939 --> 00:25:47,820
Speaker 1: bullshit That's the federal government's responsibility because it's interstate comments.

423
00:25:48,182 --> 00:25:55,660
Speaker 0: But they won't because all the states manage their own sales tax Which I think they shouldn't be able to charge the people who are out of state because that would be interstate commerce.

424
00:25:55,781 --> 00:25:58,014
Speaker 1: And I don't think yes, it would be allowed.

425
00:25:58,416 --> 00:25:59,120
Speaker 1: It's interstate.

426
00:25:59,341 --> 00:26:02,340
Speaker 1: Well, the problem is though the federal government doesn't want to have federal sales tax.

427
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:11,288
Speaker 0: Then if I buy something from Connecticut, it should be sales tax-free Yes, or we should have a federal sales tax or Federally administered state sales tax.

428
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:12,834
Speaker 0: I would be fine with any of those.

429
00:26:12,854 --> 00:26:14,660
Speaker 0: what I'm not fine with this is current situation.

430
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:19,394
Speaker 1: Where do to tell anyone's fine with the current situation is you know who is?

431
00:26:19,414 --> 00:26:21,480
Speaker 0: who really wants this situation to get worse?

432
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,220
Speaker 1: No, I'm saying who likes it the way it is brick-and-mortar stores.

433
00:26:24,461 --> 00:26:32,600
Speaker 0: They are lobbying hand over fist to keep things the way they are They are and to make Amazon be forced to pay even if they don't have business presences.

434
00:26:33,741 --> 00:26:34,343
Speaker 1: Well, but that's not.

435
00:26:34,363 --> 00:26:34,745
Speaker 1: that's not.

436
00:26:34,825 --> 00:26:37,154
Speaker 1: I'm saying that's that that's a change they're fighting for.

437
00:26:37,214 --> 00:26:39,407
Speaker 1: I'm saying who wants to keep it the way It is right.

438
00:26:39,528 --> 00:26:48,320
Speaker 0: if they can't get their change They want to keep it the way it is because it at least forces online businesses who fall into these loopholes to have to pay.

439
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,654
Speaker 1: yeah, and That amazing thing is it's not like I don't.

440
00:26:53,755 --> 00:26:54,460
Speaker 1: here's the one thing.

441
00:26:54,922 --> 00:27:00,060
Speaker 0: They seem to think that I'm only going to Amazon because I don't have to pay sales tax and that's what I do have to.

442
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,520
Speaker 0: Somehow if I had to pay that trivial sales tax that suddenly I'm gonna go to Best Buy.

443
00:27:06,062 --> 00:27:11,300
Speaker 1: The only thing I don't understand is how does paying sales tax hurt Amazon, right?

444
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,319
Speaker 1: Cuz it's like let's say Amazon sells on for a dollar.

445
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:17,553
Speaker 1: Collect the sales tax from us and then remit it doesn't have them anything.

446
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:18,276
Speaker 0: Yeah, it does.

447
00:27:18,316 --> 00:27:19,240
Speaker 0: Here's why it hurts.

448
00:27:20,262 --> 00:27:23,923
Speaker 0: If you say they had to do deal with every state sales tax, okay I say they did.

449
00:27:24,547 --> 00:27:26,820
Speaker 0: every state's laws are so completely different.

450
00:27:27,241 --> 00:27:35,700
Speaker 0: They would have to hire lawyers and do a huge amount of work to constantly make sure they're following all the laws of every state on every transaction.

451
00:27:36,761 --> 00:27:42,096
Speaker 0: Like some states like in New York, there's a sales tax on clothing in certain counties.

452
00:27:42,116 --> 00:27:46,694
Speaker 1: There's an administrative cost But it's not like but the sales tax itself.

453
00:27:46,895 --> 00:27:55,300
Speaker 0: It doesn't cost them anything No But the administrative costs are so high that I think it is Unconscious about conscionable to force Amazon or any online retail to deal with it.

454
00:27:55,641 --> 00:28:01,820
Speaker 1: But if you're like Walmart each individual Walmart store just worries about its own law and doesn't have to worry about the other one.

455
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:07,060
Speaker 0: But if I'm a store in New York I only have to worry about New York sales tax and I charge it to everyone because they're in New York.

456
00:28:07,682 --> 00:28:08,345
Speaker 1: So, how about this?

457
00:28:08,425 --> 00:28:14,368
Speaker 1: Maybe right there could be some sort of system where it's like Do you want your sales tax to be collected?

458
00:28:14,388 --> 00:28:17,979
Speaker 1: then you must send your data in by this form?

459
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's the responsibility of each locale.

460
00:28:22,505 --> 00:28:35,797
Speaker 0: My argument is that in the modern world unless there is an API that does that unless I as a business can automate it and just hook into Arizona and Nevada and Wisconsin system and that handles all of it with like soap or something then I shouldn't know.

461
00:28:35,837 --> 00:28:38,782
Speaker 1: if I was Amazon I would set up a system and you know That would be like.

462
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:42,621
Speaker 1: that would let them enter the data and be like alright if you want sales tax collected come in and type It in.

463
00:28:43,465 --> 00:28:47,100
Speaker 0: that would be fine except Amazon's in a very strong position to say fuck you.

464
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,747
Speaker 1: Well, they should because it's still.

465
00:28:48,868 --> 00:28:51,319
Speaker 1: I still think it's interstate commerce and the state shouldn't be.

466
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:57,286
Speaker 0: well The question is if I'm buying something online is the transaction occurring in the state I am in or in the state the service?

467
00:28:57,306 --> 00:28:59,032
Speaker 1: you buy something from Amazon.

468
00:28:59,133 --> 00:29:01,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, Amazon is a company in Seattle.

469
00:29:01,441 --> 00:29:02,444
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're in New York.

470
00:29:02,685 --> 00:29:06,720
Speaker 1: The money is going from your wallet in New York to a wallet in Washington.

471
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:13,517
Speaker 1: Therefore it is interstate commerce because the money is traversing state boundaries Regardless of if the item you're buying is in a warehouse in New York.

472
00:29:13,557 --> 00:29:16,272
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter The money is going from one state to another.

473
00:29:16,312 --> 00:29:17,117
Speaker 1: it's interstate commerce.

474
00:29:17,177 --> 00:29:19,187
Speaker 0: end of story And I'm not a lawyer.

475
00:29:19,267 --> 00:29:26,340
Speaker 1: Ah You're in Washington State and you buy something from Amazon and the goods are not in Washington State.

476
00:29:26,563 --> 00:29:27,660
Speaker 1: It is still interstate commerce.

477
00:29:27,761 --> 00:29:34,233
Speaker 1: The only situation would be if you give you buy something on Amazon You're in Washington State and it comes from a Washington State warehouse.

478
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:34,876
Speaker 0: What then?

479
00:29:34,977 --> 00:29:35,700
Speaker 0: it would be instant.

480
00:29:35,922 --> 00:29:37,739
Speaker 0: What if my order is?

481
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:43,480
Speaker 0: Routed through the internet to other states just because the Internet is the way it is.

482
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,360
Speaker 1: So the servers are not in the state of Washington.

483
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,714
Speaker 0: Maybe they are but the traffic goes through Wisconsin.

484
00:29:47,734 --> 00:29:51,968
Speaker 1: just somehow The internet or the internet routing traffic.

485
00:29:52,008 --> 00:29:53,575
Speaker 0: Yes, because here's a weird example.

486
00:29:53,595 --> 00:30:00,079
Speaker 0: when the Berlin Wall went up there was a subway and They went beat or under the Berlin Wall.

487
00:30:00,782 --> 00:30:10,729
Speaker 0: So there if you rode like one of the West Germany subways papers these I forget which one was which you would technically enter East Germany for a while Because it looped through the territory.

488
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:10,950
Speaker 1: Okay.

489
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:11,593
Speaker 1: Here's a question.

490
00:30:11,614 --> 00:30:12,740
Speaker 1: I I'm in New York.

491
00:30:13,161 --> 00:30:16,209
Speaker 1: I order something from a mail-order catalog in for in Detroit.

492
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,513
Speaker 1: That's clearly interstate commerce.

493
00:30:17,573 --> 00:30:17,774
Speaker 1: Yep.

494
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:20,020
Speaker 1: The mail goes through Canada.

495
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,324
Speaker 1: Is it international commerce?

496
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:24,194
Speaker 1: I don't know the met not the actual goods.

497
00:30:24,254 --> 00:30:25,860
Speaker 1: the goods don't go through customs now.

498
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:30,914
Speaker 0: Here's why I feel that you know, this is one of those situations I think the federal government should step in.

499
00:30:31,055 --> 00:30:36,193
Speaker 0: I think Should be heavily regulated by the feds and seriously fuck the states on this.

500
00:30:36,213 --> 00:30:36,673
Speaker 1: That's right.

501
00:30:42,478 --> 00:30:44,239
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day.

502
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:49,680
Speaker 1: Oh A very old thing of the day that everyone in the world knows.

503
00:30:50,343 --> 00:30:51,166
Speaker 1: I'm gonna bring it back.

504
00:30:51,347 --> 00:30:55,502
Speaker 0: If you don't know don't tell anyone that Zombocom Welcome.

505
00:30:55,944 --> 00:30:58,734
Speaker 0: Welcome to Zombocom where anything is positive.

506
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:01,303
Speaker 0: Zombocom is the most extensible website The world has ever seen.

507
00:31:01,384 --> 00:31:10,557
Speaker 0: it is the fact that it was made unattainable is attainable Like it was made so long ago and yet it does more than any single website.

508
00:31:10,597 --> 00:31:12,142
Speaker 0: web 2.0.

509
00:31:12,142 --> 00:31:19,082
Speaker 1: So much is possible that Zombocom could even be converted from flash to HTML 5.

510
00:31:19,082 --> 00:31:20,848
Speaker 0: The unattainable was attained.

511
00:31:20,969 --> 00:31:21,771
Speaker 1: It was attained.

512
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:22,734
Speaker 1: HTML 5 Zombocom.

513
00:31:22,855 --> 00:31:29,465
Speaker 0: Oh So this is one of those.

514
00:31:29,545 --> 00:31:34,340
Speaker 0: this is the kind of thing that like morning zoo would talk about but this intrigues me.

515
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,770
Speaker 0: This is one of those things where we're the internet not around.

516
00:31:37,171 --> 00:31:39,219
Speaker 0: I would never get to find out what the deal is.

517
00:31:40,187 --> 00:31:40,678
Speaker 0: There's a pool.

518
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:48,060
Speaker 0: In this pool someone drowned a swimming pool large public swimming pool outdoors with many lifeguards.

519
00:31:48,742 --> 00:31:49,464
Speaker 0: Someone drowned.

520
00:31:49,484 --> 00:31:50,406
Speaker 0: Okay.

521
00:31:50,526 --> 00:31:54,757
Speaker 0: No one noticed the body for at least two days if not longer.

522
00:31:54,777 --> 00:31:55,198
Speaker 1: What was it?

523
00:31:55,238 --> 00:31:55,760
Speaker 1: a deep pool?

524
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,532
Speaker 1: Yes, what was the color of the pool?

525
00:31:57,895 --> 00:31:58,379
Speaker 0: a blue?

526
00:31:59,201 --> 00:32:00,791
Speaker 1: Okay, so some pools aren't blue.

527
00:32:00,811 --> 00:32:05,280
Speaker 0: some of them are like gray cement, you know But like it's bluish cement or it's white cement and you know water is blue.

528
00:32:05,662 --> 00:32:09,100
Speaker 1: So this person was at the bottom of the deep pool, yes, what color was the bathing suit?

529
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:10,584
Speaker 0: I don't know and it's.

530
00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:11,186
Speaker 1: but they sunk.

531
00:32:11,688 --> 00:32:12,269
Speaker 1: they didn't float.

532
00:32:12,971 --> 00:32:23,359
Speaker 0: They sunk and drowned and then days later Despite the fact that multiple news agencies had taken pictures of this pool for unrelated stories and no one noticed the body.

533
00:32:23,861 --> 00:32:25,890
Speaker 1: Well, it was in the bottom of the pool.

534
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:27,758
Speaker 1: It's conceivable that no one would notice it.

535
00:32:27,778 --> 00:32:29,839
Speaker 0: Scott You can see to the bottom of any pool.

536
00:32:30,542 --> 00:32:35,800
Speaker 1: I'm just saying that you you could but if you weren't looking for it Scott lifeguards are obligated to look.

537
00:32:36,442 --> 00:32:38,751
Speaker 0: I know also they closed the pool at the end of the day.

538
00:32:38,771 --> 00:32:40,859
Speaker 0: You think someone might look in the pool also?

539
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:47,293
Speaker 0: inspectors pool inspectors Inspected this pool twice while the body was there.

540
00:32:47,434 --> 00:32:48,960
Speaker 0: maybe more times, right?

541
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:54,323
Speaker 1: But I mean you ever watch that video where it tells you count the number of times the guy bounces the basketball and there's a Dancing bear.

542
00:32:54,343 --> 00:32:56,859
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Scott's job is to look for drowned people.

543
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,871
Speaker 1: Lifeguards job is look for people currently drowning.

544
00:33:00,031 --> 00:33:01,298
Speaker 0: No also drowned people.

545
00:33:01,539 --> 00:33:01,983
Speaker 0: there They're.

546
00:33:02,124 --> 00:33:03,720
Speaker 0: you're supposed to look at the bottom of the pool.

547
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:09,613
Speaker 0: In fact, if you can't see the bottom of the pool because the pool is cloudy Then you have to get everyone out of the pool immediately.

548
00:33:09,633 --> 00:33:10,939
Speaker 0: That's like rules almost every pool.

549
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,288
Speaker 1: No, I'm not an expert in lifeguarding.

550
00:33:13,328 --> 00:33:16,640
Speaker 1: The point is it I could conceive of looking at a pool.

551
00:33:16,841 --> 00:33:19,511
Speaker 1: They're being someone at the bottom and not physically seeing them.

552
00:33:19,551 --> 00:33:21,579
Speaker 0: But Scott if you're a lifeguard, that's your only job.

553
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:27,258
Speaker 1: Regardless what I really don't there were three lifeguards what I really don't understand.

554
00:33:27,398 --> 00:33:34,477
Speaker 0: a kid Saw the person at the bottom of the pool Early on anything went to a lifeguard and said I think someone drowned.

555
00:33:34,517 --> 00:33:35,300
Speaker 0: nobody did anything.

556
00:33:35,682 --> 00:33:36,365
Speaker 1: Well, that's a problem.

557
00:33:36,385 --> 00:33:37,429
Speaker 1: But this is what I don't understand.

558
00:33:37,731 --> 00:33:39,800
Speaker 1: Did the person come to the pool unaccompanied?

559
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:44,480
Speaker 0: Apparently they went with friends and left and no one noticed that the person was.

560
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:48,936
Speaker 0: Understand is like a friend said after the fact that the person didn't know how to swim.

561
00:33:48,956 --> 00:33:49,966
Speaker 0: They didn't know why they went to the pool.

562
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:56,520
Speaker 1: You go to the pool with your friends and you leave without them and you don't wonder what happened to them and you just leave.

563
00:33:56,621 --> 00:33:57,989
Speaker 1: That's what's really weird.

564
00:33:58,029 --> 00:33:59,860
Speaker 0: This is just like that and there's more crazy.

565
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,800
Speaker 1: This is like a craziest and how could no one saw the person while they were drowning?

566
00:34:04,222 --> 00:34:10,005
Speaker 0: Well, cuz usually you don't you know, you know, we I think we talked about on the show how all right drowning People don't look like drowning people.

567
00:34:10,025 --> 00:34:12,614
Speaker 0: No, they look like perfectly fine and then they disappear.

568
00:34:12,735 --> 00:34:15,745
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Here's my guess.

569
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:24,260
Speaker 0: I am pretty sure that the inspectors Weren't inspecting the pool and we're taking bribes to not have to inspect the pool and now they're fucked.

570
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,786
Speaker 1: Well, I mean pool inspectors.

571
00:34:26,827 --> 00:34:29,860
Speaker 1: do they actually, you know, don't they usually just check the chemicals and stuff?

572
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,149
Speaker 0: Yeah, and also other things for example turbidity if the pool is too cloudy.

573
00:34:33,168 --> 00:34:33,871
Speaker 0: They have shut it down.

574
00:34:34,152 --> 00:34:36,520
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, and they reported everything was fine.

575
00:34:37,022 --> 00:34:37,966
Speaker 0: Oh my god on far.

576
00:34:37,985 --> 00:34:39,893
Speaker 0: There's a picture of the pool from this news article.

577
00:34:40,356 --> 00:34:42,610
Speaker 0: someone uh, Pasted Waldo's face.

578
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,896
Speaker 0: Oh That's clever, okay.

579
00:34:45,746 --> 00:34:50,833
Speaker 0: But this is just a really Sad and messed up story and I really want to know what the deal is.

580
00:34:50,893 --> 00:34:52,478
Speaker 0: The government stepped right in.

581
00:34:52,518 --> 00:34:53,625
Speaker 0: they're like What the fuck is this?

582
00:34:53,947 --> 00:34:55,920
Speaker 0: They put everybody involved on leave.

583
00:34:56,311 --> 00:35:04,152
Speaker 0: Well, yeah Every employee of the pool all the inspectors who inspected the pool and not only didn't see the body but didn't see the fact that The pool was cloudy and it's just like.

584
00:35:04,997 --> 00:35:10,103
Speaker 0: also Scott There were hundreds of people swimming in this pool every day and none of those people notice None of those people.

585
00:35:10,144 --> 00:35:13,439
Speaker 0: you think one kid with goggles would have been like there's a body down there.

586
00:35:14,307 --> 00:35:15,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, so why wasn't there?

587
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:21,620
Speaker 1: Must have been something about the body or the bathing suit or something that made it hard to see it or the cloudiness.

588
00:35:22,201 --> 00:35:26,073
Speaker 0: Ah FARC when minorities drown in pools, it turns out they become transparent.

589
00:35:26,555 --> 00:35:27,478
Speaker 1: Oh, it was minority.

590
00:35:27,939 --> 00:35:29,833
Speaker 0: I don't know I mean, no, no, I stopped.

591
00:35:29,854 --> 00:35:34,013
Speaker 0: basically I'd already read enough crazy things that I didn't read the rest of the article.

592
00:35:34,354 --> 00:35:35,860
Speaker 1: this story sounds too crazy.

593
00:35:35,941 --> 00:35:37,959
Speaker 1: It's I'm waiting for Snopes report on this one.

594
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:43,580
Speaker 1: It's looking pretty legit and it's yeah, I'm waiting for the Snopes report to get all the real details.

595
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:45,726
Speaker 1: I can't you know, this is too crazy.

596
00:35:45,766 --> 00:35:46,067
Speaker 1: Whoa.

597
00:35:46,107 --> 00:35:46,588
Speaker 0: Whoa.

598
00:35:46,629 --> 00:35:46,829
Speaker 0: Whoa.

599
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:47,150
Speaker 0: Whoa.

600
00:35:47,672 --> 00:35:49,798
Speaker 0: So apparently her friends did say she was missing.

601
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:50,600
Speaker 1: Okay?

602
00:35:51,200 --> 00:36:03,680
Speaker 0: investigators began looking for her after park personnel told them they found clothing a Cellphone and her identification card at the pool when they closed it, but they didn't investigate the pool or the facilities.

603
00:36:04,522 --> 00:36:05,049
Speaker 1: Okay.

604
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:09,200
Speaker 0: Yeah Police were told the woman was missing and was last seen at the pool.

605
00:36:09,702 --> 00:36:12,398
Speaker 0: They apparently went to the place and didn't notice anything.

606
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:20,345
Speaker 1: either There must have been something that you couldn't see it for some reason because the police the police would have seen it or There might be something else.

607
00:36:20,405 --> 00:36:20,867
Speaker 0: Here's the crazy.

608
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,457
Speaker 1: There's no way there could be crazy that many people.

609
00:36:23,477 --> 00:36:24,200
Speaker 0: Here's a crazy guess.

610
00:36:24,465 --> 00:36:25,239
Speaker 0: Someone was murdered.

611
00:36:26,764 --> 00:36:33,024
Speaker 0: They broke into the pool While it was closed and slipped the body in and then people found it the next day But the body had.

612
00:36:33,085 --> 00:36:34,029
Speaker 0: they drowned the person.

613
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,280
Speaker 0: so the coroner was like, yeah, they drowned two days ago.

614
00:36:36,401 --> 00:36:38,277
Speaker 1: The body was found eventually though, right?

615
00:36:38,861 --> 00:36:44,320
Speaker 0: It was found by kids who broke into the pool to swim after it was closed days after the body was in the ball.

616
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,647
Speaker 1: Maybe the pool was just so crowded.

617
00:36:45,687 --> 00:36:46,653
Speaker 1: No one ever could see the bottom.

618
00:36:46,994 --> 00:36:47,336
Speaker 0: I don't know.

619
00:36:47,377 --> 00:36:48,020
Speaker 1: What's the cloudiness?

620
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:48,461
Speaker 0: I don't know.

621
00:36:48,481 --> 00:36:50,389
Speaker 0: This is just crazy and too crazy.

622
00:36:50,429 --> 00:36:51,755
Speaker 1: There has to be something else to it.

623
00:36:51,775 --> 00:36:53,301
Speaker 0: I Don't know.

624
00:36:53,763 --> 00:36:54,385
Speaker 0: We'll find out.

625
00:36:54,586 --> 00:36:56,553
Speaker 0: Fark is following this heavily.

626
00:36:56,593 --> 00:36:58,360
Speaker 1: I'm thinking about hitting up the pool pretty soon.

627
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:00,892
Speaker 0: I'm thinking about going to that giant ass pool in Queens.

628
00:37:01,173 --> 00:37:01,796
Speaker 1: That's my pool.

629
00:37:01,816 --> 00:37:01,957
Speaker 1: Yeah.

630
00:37:01,997 --> 00:37:05,125
Speaker 1: Yeah I bike near it once.

631
00:37:05,165 --> 00:37:06,369
Speaker 1: Yeah, really happening.

632
00:37:06,429 --> 00:37:08,957
Speaker 1: It wasn't that crowded and it was really nice looking.

633
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:09,760
Speaker 0: It was really nice.

634
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:14,578
Speaker 1: There's people like barbecue and all around as long as you don't go when there's like a bunch of kids going.

635
00:37:14,598 --> 00:37:19,552
Speaker 0: Oh Scott I was about to say let's go this weekend But this is probably the worst possible weekend to go to that.

636
00:37:19,572 --> 00:37:21,240
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go bike around near it pretty soon.

637
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:25,160
Speaker 0: I tell you what that pool is chill this weekend and not super crowded.

638
00:37:25,481 --> 00:37:29,353
Speaker 0: We should you me Pete and Nuri and Emily should go over there swim and grill.

639
00:37:29,654 --> 00:37:29,855
Speaker 1: Yeah.

640
00:37:30,136 --> 00:37:30,497
Speaker 1: Yeah.

641
00:37:30,617 --> 00:37:34,400
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway So in the meta moment the book club book, which I'm going to do.

642
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:40,579
Speaker 0: Yeah, you did what you were going to do today, but we didn't because I got distracted and did not read foundation.

643
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:43,771
Speaker 0: yet We're gonna have the book club book episode soon.

644
00:37:43,791 --> 00:37:55,140
Speaker 1: It's Isaac Asimov's foundation and What we're gonna do is book club, you know the problem with book club I think right now is that it does seem like people are actually reading and some people actually care a lot.

645
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,888
Speaker 1: You know enough people care to make it worth it.

646
00:37:56,948 --> 00:37:58,536
Speaker 0: You got enough feedback to people.

647
00:37:58,596 --> 00:37:59,480
Speaker 1: is enough people to care?

648
00:37:59,742 --> 00:38:02,460
Speaker 0: I didn't think it was that popular but we got all this feedback suddenly.

649
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:08,312
Speaker 1: But the thing is because we only do a Thursday episode every other week and it's like we don't want book club to be like Every other Thursday, that's too much.

650
00:38:08,332 --> 00:38:12,473
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, you know They would be half the Thursday episodes to be book club episodes if we did it monthly.

651
00:38:12,594 --> 00:38:16,027
Speaker 1: and also we're gonna make book club Its own show once a month.

652
00:38:16,047 --> 00:38:17,572
Speaker 1: So there'll be 12 book clubs a year.

653
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:23,680
Speaker 0: because the trouble too is that if we do the book club You know normal geek 9s format we get all this other news and cruft on the episode.

654
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:27,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're gonna do book club as its own episode once a month.

655
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:32,578
Speaker 1: It's not gonna replace a Thursday episode anymore, which is means we really need Thursday episode ideas to send them in.

656
00:38:32,879 --> 00:38:39,823
Speaker 0: also I'm going to go find all the old book club episodes pull out the book club portions and put them in this feed Separate.

657
00:38:40,064 --> 00:38:40,266
Speaker 1: Yep.

658
00:38:40,809 --> 00:38:41,171
Speaker 1: It'll be it's.

659
00:38:41,191 --> 00:38:42,540
Speaker 1: I'll make it on its own section on the website.

660
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,759
Speaker 0: So anyway, if you have not yet finished Isaac Asimov's foundation, it's really short.

661
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:50,420
Speaker 1: You only got a few we a week couple weeks to listen to get the very least.

662
00:38:51,322 --> 00:38:53,353
Speaker 0: Just read the Wikipedia that tells you what it's about.

663
00:38:53,394 --> 00:38:56,379
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz that metamoment Kinetic on is next week.

664
00:38:56,661 --> 00:39:01,700
Speaker 0: We are the directors of the panels department gasp and we're not doing that many panels.

665
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:05,275
Speaker 0: We're doing a few because it's a lot of work to run a fucking panels department.

666
00:39:05,295 --> 00:39:10,390
Speaker 1: Let me tell you what, yep So we'll be there and then probably the week after that.

667
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:11,654
Speaker 1: We'll do the episode of foundation.

668
00:39:11,855 --> 00:39:17,380
Speaker 0: Yep, and any other Unofficial book club book is all of our Scott backers Prince of Nothing books.

669
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:19,412
Speaker 0: Just read them all because shit's going down with that.

670
00:39:20,075 --> 00:39:20,779
Speaker 1: We're out of merch.

671
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,847
Speaker 1: We're absolutely out of murder.

672
00:39:22,867 --> 00:39:23,811
Speaker 1: gonna order more merch.

673
00:39:24,172 --> 00:39:27,484
Speaker 1: I'm working on that probably after kinetic on all right But it's been time for packs though.

674
00:39:27,906 --> 00:39:29,171
Speaker 0: Hopefully in the very least.

675
00:39:29,231 --> 00:39:31,239
Speaker 0: I'll try to order the same shirt again at PAX.

676
00:39:31,741 --> 00:39:32,526
Speaker 1: We need a new shirt.

677
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:37,342
Speaker 1: Yep, send in shirt designs to Anything else.

678
00:39:37,744 --> 00:39:39,068
Speaker 0: oh that is pretty much it.

679
00:39:39,128 --> 00:39:44,927
Speaker 0: we will be at PAX Prime doing at least one panel possibly more Panel like things.

680
00:39:45,308 --> 00:39:45,529
Speaker 1: Yep.

681
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:47,496
Speaker 1: PAX dev is a maybe we don't know.

682
00:39:47,757 --> 00:39:59,011
Speaker 1: Yeah That's it all right, so Thursday, this is your idea, yeah Supermarché How you say it in French?

683
00:39:59,292 --> 00:39:59,995
Speaker 1: Okay, supermarché.

684
00:40:00,015 --> 00:40:02,137
Speaker 0: All right I don't know.

685
00:40:02,421 --> 00:40:10,483
Speaker 0: It's kind of funny that Supermarkets when gives is the best episodes over matter to me a lot more now that I don't have access to them the way I once Did.

686
00:40:10,523 --> 00:40:14,628
Speaker 1: well Stu Leonard's is also the best Almost like an amusement park.

687
00:40:14,688 --> 00:40:15,291
Speaker 1: It's a difference.

688
00:40:15,311 --> 00:40:16,335
Speaker 1: It's not exact.

689
00:40:16,355 --> 00:40:17,780
Speaker 1: It's not quite the same, right?

690
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:25,920
Speaker 1: It's like if you go to Wegmans, it's like a normal supermarket But the best Stu Leonard's is like its own kind of thing mostly for getting fresh produce dairy meats.

691
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:30,471
Speaker 1: You don't really buy the stuff that comes in packages from Stu Leonard's.

692
00:40:30,491 --> 00:40:37,593
Speaker 0: It's something that despite being very regional is very Uniform throughout the entirety of the United States.

693
00:40:37,693 --> 00:40:41,846
Speaker 0: I mean, it's it's necessarily well generally uniform.

694
00:40:41,866 --> 00:40:48,359
Speaker 0: you walk into a real big deal non Walmart supermarket and there's produce on the right.

695
00:40:49,421 --> 00:40:53,253
Speaker 1: Well, I mean that's just because you know supermarket design has become such.

696
00:40:53,334 --> 00:40:55,280
Speaker 1: they figured out the maximum money makings.

697
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:00,877
Speaker 1: Right is how do we arrange this store to make the most money and also meet the health codes?

698
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:02,891
Speaker 1: and also, you know Do all these requirements.

699
00:41:02,911 --> 00:41:16,750
Speaker 0: but like my whole life I've had this whole like this ritual of going to the supermarket to buy groceries on a regular basis and it was this kind of steady Cornerstone of my mundane life Up in New York City and then everything changed.

700
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:19,160
Speaker 0: like this is one of those places where everything's totally different.

701
00:41:19,281 --> 00:41:21,380
Speaker 1: Well, you have a doorman so you can order food online.

702
00:41:21,681 --> 00:41:25,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, also I live in a neighborhood where there aren't any supermarkets within a walking distance.

703
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:26,746
Speaker 1: I still go to the supermarket.

704
00:41:26,767 --> 00:41:28,977
Speaker 1: In fact, they're opening up a supermarket on my block.

705
00:41:29,118 --> 00:41:30,711
Speaker 1: once it's ready I won't have to cross the street.

706
00:41:30,751 --> 00:41:35,619
Speaker 0: got to admit though New York supermarkets are not really the same as what we're used to.

707
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:41,337
Speaker 1: Well, it's not a gigantic suburban supermarket that has everything in the goddamn universe, but has enough.

708
00:41:41,397 --> 00:41:42,260
Speaker 1: I'm just one person.

709
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,123
Speaker 1: What the fuck do I need?

710
00:41:43,263 --> 00:41:48,460
Speaker 0: Well, it's also the fact that now that you know, you go to it more often with less carrying capacity.

711
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,926
Speaker 0: It's not like the member in Beacon.

712
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:51,010
Speaker 0: We'd be like, there's also less.

713
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,395
Speaker 1: that's good less food spoilage.

714
00:41:52,415 --> 00:41:53,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's more money-saving.

715
00:41:54,041 --> 00:41:59,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I buy way more expensive food now than I ever bought but I buy a lot less of it.

716
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,985
Speaker 0: Yep, even though I'm eating more.

717
00:42:01,266 --> 00:42:05,480
Speaker 0: Yep, but we used to have the ritual like it's been a week and a half.

718
00:42:05,861 --> 00:42:06,985
Speaker 0: We're out of food.

719
00:42:07,306 --> 00:42:10,175
Speaker 0: We'd like for core geek nights than at 930 10 o'clock at night by a ton of food.

720
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:17,783
Speaker 0: We'd go to the shop right and buy as much food as we possibly could so you wouldn't have to go back so soon Cuz it's far away.

721
00:42:17,843 --> 00:42:22,500
Speaker 1: take like I have a chore to go there to get it out of the car and get it like unpacked.

722
00:42:22,741 --> 00:42:25,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh my god, and I was always exhausted.

723
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:25,641
Speaker 0: We'd.

724
00:42:25,701 --> 00:42:26,946
Speaker 0: I get up at like 5 a.m.

725
00:42:26,966 --> 00:42:29,555
Speaker 0: The next morning to catch a train for a but you had food.

726
00:42:30,117 --> 00:42:33,648
Speaker 1: I did have food And I have all these fun like weird.

727
00:42:33,748 --> 00:42:36,540
Speaker 1: and the thing is the only advantage of the bigger supermarket, right?

728
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,617
Speaker 1: Like a Wegmans isn't that like it's any?

729
00:42:38,677 --> 00:42:43,153
Speaker 1: you know The reason it's better is not because it just has a more selection, right?

730
00:42:43,434 --> 00:42:43,735
Speaker 1: It's like.

731
00:42:43,755 --> 00:42:45,180
Speaker 1: I don't necessarily need more selection.

732
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:55,562
Speaker 1: it's just the particular things particular items that I greatly desire and Smaller supermarkets with less selection or less likely to have those particular not all gonna have the Nueva Cucina Exactly.

733
00:42:55,622 --> 00:43:08,160
Speaker 1: You can make a small supermarket and if I was the purchaser and I chose what would be on the shelves It would be the best supermarket ever because it's just a few, you know Each person has a few items that are like their brands their items that they need

734
00:43:08,982 --> 00:43:09,224
Speaker 0: Direct.

735
00:43:09,265 --> 00:43:10,012
Speaker 0: they do that.

736
00:43:10,052 --> 00:43:10,900
Speaker 0: I get figures it out.

737
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:19,692
Speaker 0: So every time I log in it lists like here's all the shit you always buy and I'm like, yep one of those There's a humongous cereal aisle right and this you particularly like.

738
00:43:19,753 --> 00:43:21,940
Speaker 1: maybe three cereals boo berry, right?

739
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:22,523
Speaker 1: So if there's?

740
00:43:22,624 --> 00:43:27,580
Speaker 1: if there was a tiny supermarket that only had those three cereals You don't care that all the other cereals are missing.

741
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:36,579
Speaker 1: But the fact is odds are any supermarket is probably gonna have one of those cereals and the giant supermarket might have all three Amongst the mass of cereals.

742
00:43:36,881 --> 00:43:42,080
Speaker 1: Which is why you prefer the bigger supermarket because they're gonna have all the things you like just because they have so much selection.

743
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:46,510
Speaker 0: so I Learned something very important when we were living in Beacon.

744
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:50,605
Speaker 0: right one day one day I skipped work for whatever reason.

745
00:43:50,625 --> 00:43:51,508
Speaker 0: like I just didn't go to work.

746
00:43:51,568 --> 00:43:52,370
Speaker 0: It was like a Tuesday.

747
00:43:52,390 --> 00:44:02,958
Speaker 1: I thought I will buy groceries Now when I will be at the grocery store groceries during a weekday when all the old ladies are there.

748
00:44:02,978 --> 00:44:05,869
Speaker 0: and That was like another world.

749
00:44:05,929 --> 00:44:08,260
Speaker 0: it was like I was transported to a world of old people.

750
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:12,077
Speaker 0: Yep, slow old people with carts blocking every aisle.

751
00:44:12,258 --> 00:44:17,213
Speaker 0: Yep It was like this disaster of untold proportions.

752
00:44:17,274 --> 00:44:17,474
Speaker 1: Yep.

753
00:44:18,016 --> 00:44:19,340
Speaker 0: I ended up leaving and not buying anything.

754
00:44:19,742 --> 00:44:20,206
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's it.

755
00:44:20,246 --> 00:44:22,300
Speaker 1: that's a big problem in supermarkets, right?

756
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:25,520
Speaker 1: Is that you know, they need to stock a lot of things no matter the size of the store.

757
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,608
Speaker 1: They can't really have big wide aisles.

758
00:44:27,648 --> 00:44:30,660
Speaker 1: So the aisles are usually you know Wegmans has nice wide aisles.

759
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,065
Speaker 1: Not even they're not, you know.

760
00:44:32,286 --> 00:44:35,036
Speaker 1: at best you can fit two carts side-by-side, right?

761
00:44:35,137 --> 00:44:35,839
Speaker 0: I've seen three.

762
00:44:36,322 --> 00:44:37,027
Speaker 1: I've never seen three.

763
00:44:37,047 --> 00:44:40,846
Speaker 0: I've seen three, you know Two letters you can do.

764
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:43,274
Speaker 0: Leonard's is one five.

765
00:44:43,314 --> 00:44:46,244
Speaker 1: Yes, right soon as there's a one-way lane It goes through the store.

766
00:44:46,485 --> 00:44:50,280
Speaker 1: You do not stop you do not turn around you do not make any decision.

767
00:44:50,542 --> 00:44:51,207
Speaker 0: That's what we need.

768
00:44:51,227 --> 00:44:52,760
Speaker 0: that would fix that problem right quick.

769
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:54,468
Speaker 1: You go from the beginning to the end.

770
00:44:54,489 --> 00:44:56,680
Speaker 1: you have to go through every section my whole life.

771
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:57,544
Speaker 0: It's amazed me.

772
00:44:57,806 --> 00:45:00,499
Speaker 0: forget the old people just any time you go to the supermarket any hour.

773
00:45:01,002 --> 00:45:01,767
Speaker 0: And what do we do Scott?

774
00:45:01,787 --> 00:45:03,094
Speaker 0: we walk in we split up.

775
00:45:03,316 --> 00:45:06,870
Speaker 0: we go like Get everything we need as fast as possible get the fuck out.

776
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:07,171
Speaker 1: Yep.

777
00:45:07,813 --> 00:45:09,900
Speaker 0: I'll linger in a couple areas.

778
00:45:09,981 --> 00:45:11,994
Speaker 0: I'll linger in the meat-cheese area like all right.

779
00:45:12,035 --> 00:45:12,639
Speaker 0: I really like me.

780
00:45:13,601 --> 00:45:20,504
Speaker 0: I'll linger in the fresh vegetables area like oh I want to buy all of these but I shouldn't cuz I can't eat them all And that's it.

781
00:45:20,685 --> 00:45:25,227
Speaker 0: Otherwise, I get the fuck out but everyone like most people I ever see It's like they're walking.

782
00:45:25,267 --> 00:45:34,900
Speaker 0: they walk into the supermarket with purpose like I am going to buy X things and get out and get on with my life and then They like stop at the entrance and they're like days.

783
00:45:35,141 --> 00:45:36,606
Speaker 1: It's a psychological thing.

784
00:45:36,626 --> 00:45:40,260
Speaker 0: the same thing casinos do and then they like shuttle like up and down every aisle.

785
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:44,880
Speaker 1: It's a well-studied science of coercion that is affecting you whether you realize it or not.

786
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:48,930
Speaker 1: It's like you think you run in and run out But you know what you probably bought something that you weren't planning on.

787
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:53,214
Speaker 1: thing is I run it even if you're consciously Forcing yourself not to do it.

788
00:45:53,254 --> 00:45:53,839
Speaker 1: You end up doing it.

789
00:45:54,101 --> 00:45:58,600
Speaker 0: I noticed when I started buying groceries online that I there are a lot of things I don't buy anymore.

790
00:45:58,742 --> 00:46:00,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, buying online is great.

791
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:04,616
Speaker 1: Yeah Plus the best part of a buying online is that you never have to buy when you're hungry.

792
00:46:04,716 --> 00:46:05,660
Speaker 1: go into the store when you're hungry.

793
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,023
Speaker 1: Is the worst I I did is you end up buying a bunch of shit You're not gonna use.

794
00:46:09,124 --> 00:46:10,571
Speaker 0: I usually when I go hungry.

795
00:46:10,631 --> 00:46:14,085
Speaker 0: I always buy a lot of like chips and salsa Yeah, and odds.

796
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:14,948
Speaker 0: I'll buy a lot of odds.

797
00:46:15,349 --> 00:46:16,092
Speaker 1: It's you're not eating.

798
00:46:16,212 --> 00:46:17,256
Speaker 0: It's spots.

799
00:46:17,697 --> 00:46:24,080
Speaker 0: Yep I have weird fond memories of being in supermarkets like way late at night.

800
00:46:24,725 --> 00:46:26,580
Speaker 1: Yeah being supermarkets late nights fun is alright.

801
00:46:26,801 --> 00:46:33,600
Speaker 0: I hate it when markets aren't 24/7 even here like the food seller the only nice supermarket near me is closed at like 10 o'clock.

802
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:34,363
Speaker 1: What the fuck.

803
00:46:34,383 --> 00:46:35,770
Speaker 1: what the fuck be open all the time.

804
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:37,055
Speaker 1: I need food all the time.

805
00:46:37,075 --> 00:46:40,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Not anymore cuz I got delivery police.

806
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:41,614
Speaker 1: the bodegas always open.

807
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:46,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I guess Even though they were like five bucks for ice cream.

808
00:46:46,071 --> 00:46:48,380
Speaker 1: My bodega is expensive bodega guys made a new video.

809
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,613
Speaker 1: They're actually Boeing Boeing's hooking up with them.

810
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:54,689
Speaker 0: Oh, we should the Internet's Celebrities we should talk to those guys.

811
00:46:54,709 --> 00:46:55,472
Speaker 1: Those are the best guys.

812
00:46:55,492 --> 00:46:56,256
Speaker 1: They're still on the show.

813
00:46:56,336 --> 00:46:56,979
Speaker 1: They're still at it.

814
00:46:57,301 --> 00:46:58,668
Speaker 0: Yeah, those are good guys.

815
00:46:58,768 --> 00:47:01,060
Speaker 0: Those are my favorite guys, but it's something like when I was a kid.

816
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:05,139
Speaker 0: You know when you're too young to go to a bar There's nothing to do in town.

817
00:47:05,481 --> 00:47:11,287
Speaker 0: I'd always end up with a bunch of friends every now and then randomly either at like the playground Behind one of the elementary school.

818
00:47:11,307 --> 00:47:12,191
Speaker 1: You can't go to a playground.

819
00:47:12,231 --> 00:47:14,340
Speaker 1: You'll get in trouble because you're not accompanied by a child.

820
00:47:15,144 --> 00:47:18,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, when I was a kid when I was a punk kid you go to a park but on a playground.

821
00:47:18,703 --> 00:47:25,597
Speaker 0: yeah, that's bullshit, but anyway or I'd go to with all my friends like Meyer like the supermarket at like 3 a.m.

822
00:47:26,581 --> 00:47:30,500
Speaker 0: Cuz that's one of the few places that kids can go and you can get stuff that might be fun.

823
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:31,485
Speaker 0: They won't kick you out.

824
00:47:31,747 --> 00:47:34,160
Speaker 1: They've got like a tiny toy and game section.

825
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can sit on like the one bicycle the Huffy that they built in the corner and you can get it around.

826
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:46,624
Speaker 0: You can get a candy from the candy Tubs of the shittest ice cream in the world for like a dollar and get frozen pizza To put in the way.

827
00:47:46,664 --> 00:47:47,628
Speaker 1: you can get popcorn.

828
00:47:47,688 --> 00:47:50,199
Speaker 1: you can get a lot of stuff in the supermarket and you just hang out.

829
00:47:50,581 --> 00:47:53,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know until they kick you out because your punk kids they don't want you there.

830
00:47:53,581 --> 00:47:58,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, but and at RIT remember we used to have to take the bus to Wegmans.

831
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,213
Speaker 1: Well, that's only because you're carrying so many groceries.

832
00:48:00,233 --> 00:48:01,279
Speaker 1: You couldn't walk back with them.

833
00:48:01,481 --> 00:48:04,499
Speaker 1: Well, it was also kind of far and we didn't have cars.

834
00:48:04,539 --> 00:48:07,693
Speaker 0: yet We take that one movie mall shuttle.

835
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,720
Speaker 0: We'd always go.

836
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:14,199
Speaker 0: It's like a ritual like we'd always go to the Wegmans and we'd buy all our stuff and then we'd miss the bus.

837
00:48:14,219 --> 00:48:16,980
Speaker 0: cuz we'd Walk over to one of those other stores cuz we were waiting for the boss.

838
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,715
Speaker 1: There's like go to the borders and then you run back from the border.

839
00:48:19,735 --> 00:48:20,680
Speaker 0: See the boss like fuck.

840
00:48:22,986 --> 00:48:25,465
Speaker 0: Yep It was a good times.

841
00:48:25,988 --> 00:48:28,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wouldn't wanna go back to those times.

842
00:48:28,702 --> 00:48:31,630
Speaker 0: I you know, I kind of almost would cuz today.

843
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:41,840
Speaker 1: there are aspects of those times clearly that are wanted but the time you know You mean no responsibility infinite free time, but the aspect of you know Going to the grocery store at a bus and carrying girl is not what I want.

844
00:48:42,102 --> 00:48:43,490
Speaker 0: But I have the fond memories of that.

845
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:43,792
Speaker 0: cuz it was.

846
00:48:43,812 --> 00:48:45,020
Speaker 0: we're basically just hanging out.

847
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:49,840
Speaker 0: It was basically geek nights with three additional people for a couple hours, and then we got home with food.

848
00:48:50,162 --> 00:48:53,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you still don't want and we used to hang out in borders.

849
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:55,531
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz used to be bookstores.

850
00:48:55,813 --> 00:48:56,457
Speaker 1: Yeah, they used to be.

851
00:48:58,566 --> 00:49:04,636
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah Supermarkets supermarkets is pretty much the only physical store that I still have to go to.

852
00:49:04,857 --> 00:49:05,660
Speaker 0: I don't anymore.

853
00:49:06,841 --> 00:49:07,524
Speaker 0: It's pretty great.

854
00:49:07,624 --> 00:49:07,986
Speaker 0: Actually.

855
00:49:08,006 --> 00:49:09,572
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know I could.

856
00:49:09,793 --> 00:49:13,008
Speaker 1: I think someone in my building does fresh direct But I just I'm not home to get it.

857
00:49:13,069 --> 00:49:16,892
Speaker 1: Well, you can schedule it for specific time Yeah, but that's you know, it's like okay.

858
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,080
Speaker 1: I'll schedule for 10 at night.

859
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:20,111
Speaker 1: These guys show up 10 at night with groceries like great.

860
00:49:20,372 --> 00:49:21,498
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't really want to do that.

861
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:21,639
Speaker 0: Why?

862
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:23,543
Speaker 1: It's not my idea.

863
00:49:23,563 --> 00:49:26,635
Speaker 0: schedule it between like it's two-hour intervals schedule for like six o'clock.

864
00:49:27,217 --> 00:49:29,394
Speaker 0: Yeah They just bring it in.

865
00:49:30,581 --> 00:49:32,031
Speaker 1: That means I definitely have to be home.

866
00:49:32,091 --> 00:49:36,773
Speaker 0: I can't make a spontaneous plan Like if you're home, they take it into your kitchen for you.

867
00:49:36,914 --> 00:49:40,107
Speaker 1: not if yeah, but if I'm home That's the thing is I'm almost never home.

868
00:49:40,127 --> 00:49:41,734
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could live in a building with the doorman.

869
00:49:41,774 --> 00:49:42,618
Speaker 1: Yeah to move.

870
00:49:42,698 --> 00:49:43,814

00:49:46,533 --> 00:49:47,780

Speaker 1: Buy food and then eat it immediately and then only buy food.

874

893
00:50:43,428 --> 00:50:45,399
Speaker 0: I can do that with egg and cheese based dishes.

894
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:48,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could also do that with egg and cheese based the worst eggs ever.

895
00:50:49,000 --> 00:51:02,876
Speaker 0: Don't even talk to me about it, but I'm saying is if I had to I can combine What a dishes you like other than McDonald's egg, which is the only egg you ever make egg combined with pepper onion cheese And or so McDonald's omelet scallion.

896
00:51:03,098 --> 00:51:07,150
Speaker 0: Yeah So omelet do you actually flip the omelet?

898
00:51:08,655 --> 00:51:10,160
Speaker 1: I need to get an omelet pan to make it easier?

899
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, I do a real shitty job.

900
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:17,100
Speaker 0: You don't make other egg dishes like frittata eggs over easy eggs benedict sunny-side egg a quiche.

901
00:51:17,522 --> 00:51:18,125
Speaker 1: I don't like you.

902
00:51:18,165 --> 00:51:19,432
Speaker 0: sunny-side is the only dangerous one.

903
00:51:19,452 --> 00:51:20,820
Speaker 0: You should need sunny-side, but I like it.

904
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,730
Speaker 0: Anyway, I actually prefer over easy.

905
00:51:22,851 --> 00:51:23,534
Speaker 1: I like sunny-side.

906
00:51:23,816 --> 00:51:24,459
Speaker 0: just showing eggs.

907
00:51:25,343 --> 00:51:27,773
Speaker 0: Tell you yeah, I could talk about eggs for an hour.

908
00:51:27,853 --> 00:51:28,837
Speaker 1: They come out of chickens.

909
00:51:29,018 --> 00:51:29,580
Speaker 1: You open them up.

910
00:51:29,641 --> 00:51:30,250
Speaker 1: They taste good.

911
00:51:30,331 --> 00:51:30,880
Speaker 1: Cook them thoroughly.

912
00:51:31,966 --> 00:51:43,995
Speaker 0: The best egg ever is over easy French toast Where the yolk is liquid but the rest of it is not and you break it in half with toast and you shut dry toast And you shove that toast in that like egg yolk girls.

913
00:51:44,015 --> 00:51:44,778
Speaker 1: It's a girl scout.

914
00:51:45,562 --> 00:51:48,380
Speaker 1: We cut the hole in the middle of the in the bread and you put the egg in the middle.

915
00:51:48,581 --> 00:51:49,886
Speaker 0: No, that doesn't make the same thing.

916
00:51:50,147 --> 00:51:53,420
Speaker 0: It's got to be fried over easy in an obscene amount of butter.

917
00:51:53,701 --> 00:51:55,048
Speaker 0: Yeah, like an amount of butter.

918
00:51:55,088 --> 00:51:55,872
Speaker 0: That is ridiculous.

919
00:51:55,912 --> 00:51:57,440
Speaker 1: Nothing about New York grocery stores, right?

920
00:51:57,862 --> 00:52:05,012
Speaker 1: You know, not only do you have since you go less often you can buy less food at a time But they also offer smaller items, right?

921
00:52:05,052 --> 00:52:06,036
Speaker 1: So it's like in the suburbs.

922
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:07,020
Speaker 1: They offer bigger ones.

923
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can buy half a dozen eggs.

924
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:11,380
Speaker 1: They cut the egg cartons in half and sell you six eggs.

925
00:52:11,501 --> 00:52:19,500
Speaker 1: Yep, and I can't get that at the big grocery stores There's also every region of the US and I'm sure other countries as well have different grocery stores, right?

926
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:21,860
Speaker 1: So Wegmans is only available in certain places.

927
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,513
Speaker 1: Yeah The stop and shop is only available in certain places.

928
00:52:24,855 --> 00:52:25,700
Speaker 1: shop right is only in.

929
00:52:26,242 --> 00:52:29,415
Speaker 0: Wondered what the fuck was with the people who went to tops in Rochester.

930
00:52:29,656 --> 00:52:30,500
Speaker 1: I don't know it was cheaper.

931
00:52:30,942 --> 00:52:31,746
Speaker 0: It wasn't cheaper.

932
00:52:31,766 --> 00:52:32,569
Speaker 0: I went there once.

933
00:52:32,991 --> 00:52:33,634
Speaker 1: I never went there.

934
00:52:33,674 --> 00:52:38,400
Speaker 1: but down south You can go to Publix or Winn-dixie right in Florida or Georgia or whatever.

935
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:47,432
Speaker 1: And the thing is, you know each supermarket while they're mostly the same each one has you know Depending on its region and what store it is has its special things.

936
00:52:47,452 --> 00:52:49,660
Speaker 1: like Aldi the German supermarket place.

937
00:52:49,982 --> 00:52:54,466
Speaker 1: They sell like incredibly cheap computers Thing and people line up to buy them.

938
00:52:54,727 --> 00:52:57,837
Speaker 1: Meyer Publix in Florida, they make peanut butter.

939
00:52:57,977 --> 00:53:00,156
Speaker 1: in the deli section You can buy the peanut butter.

940
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,104
Speaker 1: It's like Institution.

941
00:53:02,606 --> 00:53:02,807
Speaker 1: Yeah.

942
00:53:03,028 --> 00:53:08,147
Speaker 1: Well Stu Leonard's is its own special things only like four of them I think like Myers in Michigan.

943
00:53:08,248 --> 00:53:18,180
Speaker 0: little note little weird aside if you're ever in Michigan or parts of the Midwest like that part like The the more affluent part of the Midwest almost any store name, especially if it's like a grocery kind of store.

944
00:53:18,982 --> 00:53:30,520
Speaker 0: They always they don't pluralize it but they add an S on the end because it's usually like like it's that Person's store like Kroger's or Meyers because I'm going to Walmart's Kmart's.

945
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:34,299
Speaker 0: Actually, yeah people often will say things like Kmart's.

946
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:45,439
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, you know this you know, while we don't do that so much in the Northeast right for you know, for example There are stores such as JC penny and people say I'm going to pennies or JC pennies.

947
00:53:45,661 --> 00:53:48,320
Speaker 1: But you know Macy's has an S at the end.

948
00:53:48,802 --> 00:53:53,754
Speaker 0: But in the Midwest just you'll know you'll notice you'll know people in the Midwest because they will say Grocery stores.

949
00:53:53,775 --> 00:53:59,194
Speaker 1: Yeah Min's has an S at the end and Stu Leonard's does too, but people don't say stop in shops.

950
00:53:59,375 --> 00:54:00,298
Speaker 1: They say stop and shop.
