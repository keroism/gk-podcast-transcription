1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,089
Speaker 0: It's Thursday April 12.

2
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:12,671
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:15,199
Speaker 0: I'm rim and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:17,242 --> 00:00:21,879
Speaker 0: Tonight we'll reminisce about one of our favorite toys the super soaker.

5
00:00:23,963 --> 00:00:24,998
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:27,552 --> 00:00:33,790
Speaker 1: Not only did it rain all day, but it's supposed to rain for the next five or six days pretty much continuously here.

7
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:35,034
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not good.

8
00:00:35,074 --> 00:00:37,280
Speaker 0: I mean the first work softball game.

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,063
Speaker 0: I thought was last.

10
00:00:38,103 --> 00:00:47,290
Speaker 0: Friday's is actually tomorrow and It's probably gonna be rained out Which would kind of suck if I stayed in the city for nothing and then got home late for nothing.

11
00:00:47,832 --> 00:00:51,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, well the thing is I'm sure they would know if it's gonna be rained out ahead of time.

12
00:00:52,691 --> 00:00:54,619
Speaker 0: You know disorganized these things can be.

13
00:00:54,860 --> 00:01:00,422
Speaker 1: well if it's that disorganized then half the people Probably won't show up if there's a chance of rain, so don't even chance it.

14
00:01:00,744 --> 00:01:03,635
Speaker 0: well the thing is if they don't show up And we do it wins.

15
00:01:03,655 --> 00:01:06,706
Speaker 0: you got a show that that's the way it works, but who cares?

16
00:01:06,847 --> 00:01:07,670
Speaker 1: it's a little league.

17
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,600
Speaker 1: It's not like the winning or losing matters.

18
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,610
Speaker 1: You only show up because you want to play softball.

19
00:01:12,032 --> 00:01:13,317
Speaker 0: I think it actually does kind of.

20
00:01:13,658 --> 00:01:14,843
Speaker 0: I think there is like a prize.

21
00:01:14,903 --> 00:01:16,449
Speaker 0: It's like a city league thing.

22
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:18,737
Speaker 1: Why do you think you're gonna win?

23
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:22,030
Speaker 1: you think you're good enough to win the city league who knows?

24
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:30,025
Speaker 0: I think the the advantage that our team has though is that we're young people and we'll probably Mostly playing against middle-aged men well might be able to beat them.

25
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:32,378
Speaker 1: while you are young people I know how fast you can run.

26
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:37,134
Speaker 0: you don't have to run Very Long hit.

27
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,763
Speaker 1: when is the last time you swung a bat?

28
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,270
Speaker 0: I can I can hit a ball.

29
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,247
Speaker 1: It was the last time you swung a baseball bat at a projectile and a wiffle.

30
00:01:44,267 --> 00:01:48,802
Speaker 0: that doesn't count I don't remember, but I was always good at hitting relatively.

31
00:01:48,903 --> 00:01:50,990
Speaker 1: Do you own a baseball mitt or a softball mitt?

32
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:51,953
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do.

33
00:01:52,073 --> 00:01:53,703
Speaker 0: Where is it my parents house?

34
00:01:54,005 --> 00:01:54,749
Speaker 1: Uh-huh?

35
00:01:55,631 --> 00:01:56,857
Speaker 1: We'll see how well this goes.

36
00:01:57,078 --> 00:01:57,801
Speaker 1: yeah, I don't know.

37
00:01:57,822 --> 00:01:59,289
Speaker 1: if I were you I wouldn't bother showing up.

38
00:02:00,092 --> 00:02:04,110
Speaker 0: Okay, there's a couple games that are gonna be on Fridays at like five something.

39
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:07,547
Speaker 0: So I'll probably go to those games for sure unless it rains.

40
00:02:07,889 --> 00:02:12,750
Speaker 0: well Yes, but the next game isn't until like a month from tomorrow, so it's not a problem.

41
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:16,322
Speaker 1: I think the point is this weather sucks, and I don't like it.

42
00:02:16,563 --> 00:02:16,723
Speaker 0: Yeah.

43
00:02:17,225 --> 00:02:17,747
Speaker 0: What's the deal?

44
00:02:17,807 --> 00:02:25,729
Speaker 0: It's supposed to be spring It's supposed to be warming okay granted It's finally not stupidly cold, and it's finally not snowing which is I'm glad for that.

45
00:02:25,749 --> 00:02:26,735
Speaker 1: plus We can't complain.

46
00:02:26,776 --> 00:02:30,973
Speaker 1: no April showers May flowers It's still.

47
00:02:31,094 --> 00:02:32,678
Speaker 0: it's not cold like goddamn.

48
00:02:32,738 --> 00:02:34,824
Speaker 0: I'm cold, but it's still too cold.

49
00:02:34,844 --> 00:02:35,767
Speaker 0: I need a coat.

50
00:02:36,128 --> 00:02:36,830
Speaker 0: It's it's wet.

51
00:02:37,352 --> 00:02:39,201
Speaker 0: I can't just go outside and do what I want.

52
00:02:39,503 --> 00:02:41,030
Speaker 1: actually it's really not that cold.

53
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:44,650
Speaker 1: I was wearing shorts yesterday and the day before it's not warm enough.

54
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:51,550
Speaker 0: I can't go driving around everywhere with all my windows in my car open and no shirt on and be comfortable all right.

55
00:02:52,274 --> 00:02:56,606
Speaker 1: But I finally it's nice out and I get to climb the mountain And I got this camera and I take a bunch of pictures.

56
00:02:56,666 --> 00:03:10,503
Speaker 1: and then Immediately now that I'm all set to go hiking every day and all that fun stuff It just rains every day, and you can't exactly go hiking in the rain, especially I'm not well one on the mountains when it rains.

57
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,630
Speaker 1: It's just mud and muck everywhere.

58
00:03:13,072 --> 00:03:16,730
Speaker 1: There's no trail other than the mud and muck trail also.

59
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,653
Speaker 1: It's dangerous.

60
00:03:17,814 --> 00:03:19,179
Speaker 0: so go through the mud and the muck.

61
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:19,841
Speaker 0: is it gonna hurt you?

62
00:03:20,383 --> 00:03:23,552
Speaker 1: oh, yeah, cuz I'll probably fall off the mountain Suck.

63
00:03:23,572 --> 00:03:26,561
Speaker 1: then I'd like to see you get up there in the rain.

64
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,310
Speaker 0: I die well in my all-terrain vehicle.

65
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:33,350
Speaker 1: Oh, there's no road that goes up that one, and I'm sure there's a road somewhere.

66
00:03:33,511 --> 00:03:34,776
Speaker 0: I'm not not on that one.

67
00:03:34,836 --> 00:03:35,840
Speaker 0: Maybe on the other side.

68
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:39,388
Speaker 1: No maybe on another mountain in the ridge I'll just have to make a road.

69
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:45,989
Speaker 1: I'd like to see you try my chainsaw anyway chainsaw chainsaw on the rocks.

70
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:53,569
Speaker 0: Oh My dynamite chainsaw makes roads out of rocks.

71
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:55,515
Speaker 0: I Think we're done here.

72
00:03:56,098 --> 00:03:58,150
Speaker 0: Let's move on to some news and nuts.

73
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,015
Speaker 1: There's no news.

74
00:03:59,276 --> 00:04:01,750
Speaker 1: my thing of the day is crack because I couldn't find anything better.

75
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:04,923
Speaker 1: My news is lame because the only news was that Kurt Vonnegut died.

76
00:04:04,943 --> 00:04:07,404
Speaker 1: and all I have to say about that is I really like Kurt Vonnegut.

77
00:04:07,628 --> 00:04:10,678
Speaker 0: I Really like Kurt Vonnegut, and I'm sad.

78
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:11,120
Speaker 0: He's dead.

79
00:04:11,842 --> 00:04:19,026
Speaker 0: usually when people like famous people die I go Oh that famous person died, and it's kind of rare when it's actually someone where I go.

80
00:04:19,466 --> 00:04:23,149
Speaker 1: oh great Yeah, I mean I felt the same way when Hunter S. Thompson died.

81
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:29,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I read less Hunter S. Thompson that I read Kurt Vonnegut so I cared less, but I still cared.

82
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:30,865
Speaker 1: Yep, though was interesting.

83
00:04:30,906 --> 00:04:37,344
Speaker 1: at work I was futzing with something and I ended up moving someone's printer And I noticed they had printed out an article about Kurt Vonnegut.

84
00:04:37,385 --> 00:04:38,450
Speaker 0: really that's how you found out.

85
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,306
Speaker 0: You know how I found out?

86
00:04:40,032 --> 00:04:46,768
Speaker 0: I was I was standing waiting for the sixth train to go to work and Someone standing next to me had the newspaper open and that article was right there.

87
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:52,949
Speaker 1: Actually, I really found out on FARC, and then I just noted that someone else also cared about Kurt Vonnegut at my work.

88
00:04:53,871 --> 00:05:01,144
Speaker 1: Granted it was at the one place where all the cool people seem to be you know all the metal people and the Scottish stuff And the people who know about computers at least a little.

89
00:05:01,164 --> 00:05:06,990
Speaker 0: yep Oh, so didn't I did I say on the show about the guy in the subway who was reading samurai executioner?

90
00:05:07,716 --> 00:05:08,302
Speaker 1: I don't know.

91
00:05:08,383 --> 00:05:08,888
Speaker 1: you told me.

92
00:05:09,472 --> 00:05:15,704
Speaker 0: Anyway, there's there's been a trend recently if I see people reading comics on the subway I think the subways and comics go hand in hand.

93
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:19,630
Speaker 0: and then yesterday I saw a guy on the subway, and he was reading samurai executioner.

94
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,664
Speaker 0: I didn't know which volume so I just went over to him.

95
00:05:21,684 --> 00:05:26,823
Speaker 0: I was like hey Kazuo Koike and he was like yeah, and that was that.

96
00:05:27,245 --> 00:05:31,800
Speaker 1: see what you should have done is you say that That's like the first test like do you know who wrote the thing?

97
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,789
Speaker 1: you're eating mm-hmm, and if he says yes, then you say Go to guy.

98
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:50,630
Speaker 1: They said because then you've started the conversation because now that person's either gonna think wow this guy knows going guy Or he's gonna think I better figure out what that thing he just said is because it must be somehow related.

99
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,309
Speaker 0: I should have said Ryuichi Ikigami.

100
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:58,704
Speaker 0: Then today I saw some lady and it looked like her son or maybe grandson.

101
00:05:58,744 --> 00:05:59,526
Speaker 0: I couldn't really tell.

102
00:05:59,566 --> 00:06:00,048
Speaker 0: what do I know?

103
00:06:00,088 --> 00:06:14,129
Speaker 0: they're strangers And they had it's not a good comic, but they had a Superman showcase Which is basically a big fat black-and-white book of a bunch of old Superman comics And she was reading them to her kid, which is pretty cool, so yeah

104
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:22,631
Speaker 1: Actually, this was like three days ago But I was walking around in the Bronx and I ended up standing by a traffic thing and there was a kid walking with his Mom.

105
00:06:22,651 --> 00:06:26,169
Speaker 1: he had a DS, and I heard some Phoenix Wright music.

106
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,530
Speaker 1: So I and I look and I look at the kid and I can kind of see his screen.

107
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,589
Speaker 1: He's obviously near the end of the first Phoenix Wright game.

108
00:06:34,152 --> 00:06:44,970
Speaker 1: So I say if something smells it's usually the butts and the kid is like Hahaha, and the mother looks at me with this look of what did you just say to my child?

109
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:51,165
Speaker 1: And she just stares at me because I'm this 20-something guy who just said something about a butt to her kid.

110
00:06:51,186 --> 00:06:53,812
Speaker 1: It was like 11.

111
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:54,740
Speaker 0: What did the kid say?

112
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,030
Speaker 1: the kid didn't say anything?

113
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,094
Speaker 1: He kind of laughed.

114
00:06:57,114 --> 00:07:00,790
Speaker 1: at the same time he seemed a little weirded out that someone talked to him.

115
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,337
Speaker 1: It wasn't his mom on the street.

116
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,984
Speaker 0: Hey it happens.

117
00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:10,426
Speaker 1: Yeah, though Yeah, I think this should be a trend whenever you see someone who is engaged in some form of media.

118
00:07:10,486 --> 00:07:13,615
Speaker 1: That is fairly rare Compared to normal people.

119
00:07:14,037 --> 00:07:15,260
Speaker 1: that is something that you like.

120
00:07:15,762 --> 00:07:18,550
Speaker 1: it's kind of a way to pick out the cool person in the crowd.

121
00:07:19,032 --> 00:07:20,217
Speaker 0: I think we just need a jet.

122
00:07:20,237 --> 00:07:31,277
Speaker 0: like if you're at a can anime convention or any sort of geek convention Everyone's doing something geeky, but when you see something doing something geeky that you like you always say hey I like that thing.

123
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:31,901
Speaker 0: you got there.

124
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:33,510
Speaker 1: Hey, I see you like mudkips.

125
00:07:33,772 --> 00:07:35,429
Speaker 0: Yeah, I heard you like mudkips.

126
00:07:35,912 --> 00:07:39,266
Speaker 0: So we got it sort of bring that out into the real world.

127
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:40,129
Speaker 0: where in the real world?

128
00:07:40,571 --> 00:07:44,166
Speaker 0: Well the non convention part of the world because conventions are still the real world.

129
00:07:44,186 --> 00:07:55,641
Speaker 0: Yeah No, this fantasy world exactly when you see someone doing anything geeky at all and a non geek environment You have to say hey, that's the rule.

130
00:07:55,842 --> 00:08:02,305
Speaker 0: you have to say something or else It sort of makes the world feel like there are the correct number of geeks about.

131
00:08:02,325 --> 00:08:03,790
Speaker 0: you know how many stealth geeks there are.

132
00:08:04,113 --> 00:08:05,529
Speaker 0: We got to unselfify them.

133
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,337
Speaker 0: Yeah pirates must win over the ninjas.

134
00:08:07,358 --> 00:08:10,250
Speaker 0: you have to be all flamboyant and wear your geekery on your sleeve.

135
00:08:10,511 --> 00:08:21,810
Speaker 1: I mean that's part of the reason you have all that social currency business with Nintendo and everything I carry on my person at all times various artifacts of my interests just in the hopes.

136
00:08:21,891 --> 00:08:28,342
Speaker 0: That's why you gotta put stickers in the top of your laptop And you got to put buttons on your bag, you know, we're a nerdy t-shirt.

137
00:08:28,463 --> 00:08:41,136
Speaker 1: in all the jobs I have ever had Never once has any co-worker ever seen any of the things I carry around and in any way Recognized what they might possibly have been.

138
00:08:41,157 --> 00:08:46,350
Speaker 1: Yep at most at best they'd ask me like so what the hell are those plastic things?

139
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,214
Speaker 1: All over your desk?

140
00:08:47,254 --> 00:08:49,829
Speaker 1: or what's that stupid blue circle on your keychain?

141
00:08:51,371 --> 00:08:54,309
Speaker 1: They Know what Mario is some of them, but that's about it.

142
00:08:54,711 --> 00:09:00,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, one of my one of the four partners who runs my business has a lot of Mario action in his office.

143
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:01,598
Speaker 0: So fear.

144
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,470
Speaker 1: Oh, you should have seen my office in IBM.

145
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:10,052
Speaker 1: I had PVCs and wall scrolls and posters covering pretty much everything on my side of it and nothing No one.

146
00:09:10,093 --> 00:09:14,070
Speaker 1: every now and then one guy be like, I think my kid likes that stuff that you got on your wall.

147
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:14,572
Speaker 1: What is it?

148
00:09:15,174 --> 00:09:20,914
Speaker 0: So I have the Mario diorama in my office the one raised infinite lives in world whatever.

149
00:09:21,323 --> 00:09:27,130
Speaker 0: but When I'm gonna eventually move to a different desk and when I do that, I'll probably bring some more pimpage, but not much.

150
00:09:27,451 --> 00:09:29,020
Speaker 0: I like to keep it light and tasteful.

151
00:09:29,543 --> 00:09:30,770
Speaker 0: I'm thinking about getting a retro robot.

152
00:09:31,533 --> 00:09:34,990
Speaker 1: So in the news that isn't depressing, you know, not people we like to died.

153
00:09:35,592 --> 00:09:39,063
Speaker 1: I want to talk about this mostly because I have a little thing to say about.

154
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:47,870
Speaker 1: I think I mentioned this before but Chicago is Talking about banning cocaine the energy drink not cocaine the drug that is already banned.

155
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:49,536
Speaker 1: Yes, now on one hand.

156
00:09:49,817 --> 00:09:55,399
Speaker 1: I think the rationale for it isn't that it's dangerous, but that it promotes drug use Which is probably the stupidest thing ever.

157
00:09:55,982 --> 00:09:57,650
Speaker 0: that is pretty goddamn stupid.

158
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:02,330
Speaker 0: That's like saying they're going to the cookware store prevents promote smoking weed.

159
00:10:02,891 --> 00:10:03,152
Speaker 1: What.

160
00:10:03,593 --> 00:10:07,945
Speaker 0: that's like saying that going to stoners pot palace promotes marijuana.

161
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:13,783
Speaker 1: So you're making a joke about Oh if people go and buy a pot, but then you didn't say pot.

162
00:10:14,004 --> 00:10:19,139
Speaker 1: you went one step more Ambiguous to the point that you just you didn't make a joke.

163
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,904
Speaker 1: You just kind of joke.

164
00:10:21,044 --> 00:10:23,150
Speaker 0: It was barely a joke anyway.

165
00:10:23,913 --> 00:10:29,061
Speaker 0: Yes, if there are two things that are Advertising there are two things that are called pot buying.

166
00:10:29,322 --> 00:10:31,209
Speaker 0: one does not suddenly make you want to buy the other.

167
00:10:31,229 --> 00:10:35,450
Speaker 0: if there are two Things called cocaine buying one isn't gonna make you buy the other unless you're a kettle.

168
00:10:36,593 --> 00:10:37,117
Speaker 0: Yes, you are.

169
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:39,030
Speaker 1: I think my joke is much better than your joke.

170
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,997
Speaker 1: I could go one step further about.

171
00:10:41,499 --> 00:10:46,445
Speaker 1: I miss calling the kettle black pot something I could go on a roll with this.

172
00:10:46,486 --> 00:10:46,930
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna.

173
00:10:47,891 --> 00:10:49,439
Speaker 1: I think it was a great idea.

174
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:51,330
Speaker 0: You know, you didn't even know I'm as was until yesterday.

175
00:10:51,511 --> 00:10:53,990
Speaker 0: So what do you who can't really make jokes about him?

176
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,852
Speaker 1: Why can't I?

177
00:10:55,093 --> 00:10:59,667
Speaker 1: he suddenly appeared in the media because he was mentioned on FARC for saying something silly.

178
00:10:59,688 --> 00:11:09,139
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, now while I'd say that these reasons for banning cocaine are stupid I will point out that the energy drink cocaine.

179
00:11:09,219 --> 00:11:09,861
Speaker 1: I've tried it.

180
00:11:10,383 --> 00:11:12,570
Speaker 1: it tastes like an asshole.

181
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:15,850
Speaker 1: It's the worst thing I have ever put in my mouth.

182
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:17,773
Speaker 1: I'm dead serious.

183
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:20,060
Speaker 1: I've never tasted anything worse than this ever.

184
00:11:20,301 --> 00:11:23,070
Speaker 0: Well, I don't and I ate a rotten apple.

185
00:11:23,311 --> 00:11:29,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I don't drink energy drinks, but I've smelled Red Bull and Red Bull smells like cough syrup.

186
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,119
Speaker 1: Red Bull tastes like wonderful.

187
00:11:31,521 --> 00:11:32,909
Speaker 0: Anyway rim seems to like that.

188
00:11:33,472 --> 00:11:40,515
Speaker 0: So if he doesn't like cocaine and I don't like the smell of Red Bull I can only imagine Cocaine was pretty bad.

189
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,582
Speaker 1: the smell of cocaine.

190
00:11:42,663 --> 00:11:46,696
Speaker 1: if you just open it and take a sniff of it It smells like vomit.

191
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:47,900
Speaker 1: I smell it.

192
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,325
Speaker 1: I just feel like I'm gonna vomit.

193
00:11:49,446 --> 00:11:50,590
Speaker 1: I just it makes me nauseous.

194
00:11:50,951 --> 00:11:51,654
Speaker 0: That's not good.

195
00:11:51,995 --> 00:11:54,685
Speaker 1: I drank a sip of it and I sat there going god.

196
00:11:55,408 --> 00:11:55,468
Speaker 1: Ah.

197
00:11:57,251 --> 00:12:00,444
Speaker 1: And then for some reason I took another sip like.

198
00:12:00,484 --> 00:12:01,930
Speaker 1: maybe the first sip didn't work.

199
00:12:02,371 --> 00:12:04,438
Speaker 1: Maybe it's gonna taste different this time.

200
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,683
Speaker 1: It tasted exactly the same.

201
00:12:06,586 --> 00:12:07,830
Speaker 1: I think I talked about this before.

202
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:08,774
Speaker 0: Take a third sip.

203
00:12:09,236 --> 00:12:09,517
Speaker 1: Actually.

204
00:12:09,597 --> 00:12:16,043
Speaker 1: No, I let it sit there in my two times For like five minutes cuz I didn't want to throw it away cuz it cost me like 325.

205
00:12:16,043 --> 00:12:16,545
Speaker 1: Oh you bought it.

206
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:18,835
Speaker 0: I thought you got it for free.

207
00:12:19,036 --> 00:12:19,720
Speaker 1: No, I bought it.

208
00:12:20,202 --> 00:12:22,132
Speaker 0: Uh, uh Bad move.

209
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:25,183
Speaker 1: Well, I needed a Red Bull cuz I was really tired.

210
00:12:25,243 --> 00:12:27,290
Speaker 1: and then hey, there's that cocaine drink.

211
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:30,561
Speaker 1: I've never seen it outside of the city and I'm really tired.

212
00:12:30,962 --> 00:12:35,043
Speaker 1: and it's not much more than Red Bull which is horribly Marked up at the drugstore.

213
00:12:35,063 --> 00:12:35,909
Speaker 1: I happen to be at.

214
00:12:36,752 --> 00:12:38,569
Speaker 0: Yeah, Red Bull is a lot of money big mistake.

215
00:12:39,871 --> 00:12:48,003
Speaker 1: But yeah, if Chicago bands cocaine, I'm really not at all Mad about that even though they're banning it for the wrong reason.

216
00:12:48,123 --> 00:12:50,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, I really don't like banning things.

217
00:12:50,532 --> 00:12:52,320
Speaker 0: I want to have as much freedom as possible.

218
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:54,430
Speaker 0: So or as much freedom is as reasonable.

219
00:12:55,032 --> 00:12:59,886
Speaker 0: So banning something that there's no reason to ban is not so it's not something I'm in favor of.

220
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:04,965
Speaker 0: but you considering the cocaine Tastes bad is probably bad for you and isn't always bad.

221
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:06,270
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna get worked up.

222
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,961
Speaker 1: Oh, well cocaine is designed to actually simulate cocaine.

223
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:13,130
Speaker 1: So it has some sort of chemical in it that numbs your throats.

224
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:15,622
Speaker 0: Yes, it can't be good.

225
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:21,568
Speaker 1: It also has like 280 or 300 milligrams of caffeine in it which is way too much caffeine.

226
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,510
Speaker 1: and That's coming from a guy who likes caffeine a lot.

227
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:27,203
Speaker 0: There's a guy at work who drinks a pot of coffee before he comes to work.

228
00:13:27,384 --> 00:13:28,409
Speaker 0: a pot a pot.

229
00:13:29,652 --> 00:13:30,375
Speaker 0: They were asking him.

230
00:13:30,415 --> 00:13:34,130
Speaker 0: he was drinking coffee at like three and they were like, hey how much coffee did you drink today?

231
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,101
Speaker 0: He's like, this is cup number something actually how much you drink?

232
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:39,550
Speaker 0: before you came to work and he was like pot.

233
00:13:39,891 --> 00:13:40,032
Speaker 1: He was.

234
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:44,670
Speaker 1: there was a guy back at IBM who drank gallons of coffee every day.

235
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:50,455
Speaker 1: He just carried around this gigantic thermos that he's had for like 20 years everywhere Golly refilling it.

236
00:13:50,535 --> 00:13:51,197
Speaker 1: but here's the thing.

237
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:53,064
Speaker 0: It was the cup on his belly.

238
00:13:53,244 --> 00:13:54,148
Speaker 1: It was decaf.

239
00:13:54,228 --> 00:13:54,830
Speaker 0: What the hell?

240
00:13:55,050 --> 00:14:02,161
Speaker 1: So, I don't know why he was drinking it because it's not like decaf taste good in the first place And you're not getting the primary benefit, which is caffeine.

241
00:14:02,623 --> 00:14:05,010
Speaker 1: You're basically drinking bad tasting water.

242
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:06,617
Speaker 0: That's fucked up right there.

243
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,807
Speaker 1: That's like drinking sugar-free Red Bull.

244
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:09,370
Speaker 1: What's the point?

245
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:12,243
Speaker 0: My boss drinks free sugary and free Red Bull.

246
00:14:12,283 --> 00:14:17,190
Speaker 1: He comes into work every day carrying Why half the rush of Red Bull is that you just drank a whole bunch of glucose?

247
00:14:17,936 --> 00:14:20,020
Speaker 0: I don't know man, but that's what he drinks All right.

248
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:26,370
Speaker 0: So, you know that awesome TV show on the BBC called top gear that we have to watch on YouTube and Google video?

249
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:33,590
Speaker 1: Yes, which actually I prefer watching it on Google video because it's not like I'd see it on TV Plus when you watch it on Google video, you don't have to watch the whole episode.

250
00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:38,117
Speaker 0: You can just watch one segment that you want to see and the other segments You don't have to see is not?

251
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,865
Speaker 0: every segment is exciting and entertaining.

252
00:14:39,925 --> 00:14:41,030
Speaker 0: Some of them are kind of okay.

253
00:14:41,271 --> 00:14:45,466
Speaker 1: I really only want to watch them do stupid things to cars and I want to watch the Stig race.

254
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:46,410
Speaker 0: That's pretty much it.

255
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:57,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, it seems like they might be in a deal to bring this show to the US without and judging by reading of this Article they're not gonna modify it too much too much.

256
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:58,664
Speaker 0: Well, you know, they're gonna.

257
00:14:59,005 --> 00:14:59,387
Speaker 1: well they get.

258
00:14:59,407 --> 00:15:00,470
Speaker 1: they gotta localize it.

259
00:15:00,771 --> 00:15:01,535
Speaker 0: I mean they are.

260
00:15:01,575 --> 00:15:04,450
Speaker 1: those people in England speak this weird-ass language.

261
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:08,030
Speaker 0: Well, I think the old they're basically gonna keep the show format the same.

262
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,479
Speaker 0: I don't know if they'll keep the same host.

263
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,526
Speaker 0: They might do that.

264
00:15:10,587 --> 00:15:11,030
Speaker 0: Who knows?

265
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:21,665
Speaker 0: they're still gonna have people racing against the Stig and Just like in Britain where they have British famous people race You know the normal cars around the track to try to beat each other.

266
00:15:21,725 --> 00:15:25,750
Speaker 0: They're gonna have American Famous people race cars around the track, huh?

267
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:29,290
Speaker 1: You know if it doesn't have the same hosts, I really won't care about it at all me either.

268
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:32,470
Speaker 1: But it might because I mean I'm interested in the cars.

269
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:36,769
Speaker 1: But the hosts of that show are the only reason I actually watch because they're really funny.

270
00:15:37,213 --> 00:15:39,773
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like hey And they're not.

271
00:15:40,134 --> 00:15:44,330
Speaker 0: the thing that makes that show so great is that you have these really funny really entertaining guys.

272
00:15:44,872 --> 00:15:53,670
Speaker 0: but they're guys who actually know and care about cars as opposed to Famous people who were you know professional hosts just happened to hosting a show about cars.

273
00:15:54,075 --> 00:16:04,450
Speaker 0: They're actual car guys Which is why the show works which is the same reason why blogs beat the newspaper because the newspaper people who are journalists They don't actually usually know about the thing they're writing about.

274
00:16:04,771 --> 00:16:21,095
Speaker 1: I think it also helps that they have albionic accents which in America as we've talked about before tends to give the perception of Increased intelligence and among a lot of people things just seem funnier when they have that sort of accent probably because a lot of us Grew up on Monty Python.

275
00:16:21,296 --> 00:16:23,123
Speaker 0: It might be it might not be who knows.

276
00:16:23,304 --> 00:16:24,590
Speaker 1: I think that's definitely part of it.

277
00:16:24,731 --> 00:16:32,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, if the show comes to America I hope it's still good because that'll just mean more top gear for everybody and maybe they'll just show the British show in America.

278
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,415
Speaker 1: That's what I really want.

279
00:16:33,435 --> 00:16:37,152
Speaker 0: That would be fine because then more people in this side of the water would know You know what?

280
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:46,710
Speaker 1: No, I don't want that because if they do that Then they're more likely to start taking the episodes off at YouTube And then I'm less likely to actually see them because a TV show?

281
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,293
Speaker 0: I don't think I do.

282
00:16:47,313 --> 00:16:50,850
Speaker 0: they gotta put a DVD box set to this thing so we can Netflix it.

283
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,035
Speaker 0: That's right Netflix top gear.

284
00:16:52,195 --> 00:16:53,842
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz you only need to see an episode once.

285
00:16:54,063 --> 00:16:54,666
Speaker 0: if they do that.

286
00:16:54,726 --> 00:16:55,349
Speaker 0: That would be hot.

287
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,855
Speaker 0: Hey British people.

288
00:16:58,116 --> 00:16:59,762
Speaker 0: Do you have top gear DVDs?

289
00:17:00,264 --> 00:17:08,115
Speaker 1: If so, send them to Actually if any of our Albionic listeners out there.

290
00:17:08,135 --> 00:17:09,761
Speaker 1: I just like saying Albion and Albionic.

291
00:17:10,061 --> 00:17:10,845
Speaker 1: It's not really a word.

292
00:17:10,865 --> 00:17:12,290
Speaker 0: I don't think I don't think so.

293
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:13,098
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm just gonna edit.

294
00:17:13,118 --> 00:17:14,109
Speaker 0: the only word is Albion.

295
00:17:14,531 --> 00:17:15,615
Speaker 1: Well Albion is the noun.

296
00:17:15,736 --> 00:17:19,829
Speaker 1: so by the rules of grammar and conjugation and such I can add.

297
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,983
Speaker 0: But we're talking about words from the other side of the ocean where those rules don't apply.

298
00:17:23,002 --> 00:17:27,166
Speaker 1: So I'll be honest albinish albinites.

299
00:17:27,991 --> 00:17:38,164
Speaker 1: Anyway, if you know from that island There Could in some way copy and then send to us DVDs of top gear.

300
00:17:38,264 --> 00:17:43,362
Speaker 1: if you in fact have DVDs of top gear We will shower vast riches upon you though.

301
00:17:43,502 --> 00:17:45,430
Speaker 1: Such vast riches may or may not exist.

302
00:17:45,751 --> 00:17:47,558
Speaker 0: I'll check amazon.co.uk.

303
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:53,380
Speaker 0: you do that top gear box set 25 pounds 25 pounds.

304
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:53,841
Speaker 1: That's it.

305
00:17:54,464 --> 00:17:55,567
Speaker 0: for how many DVDs?

306
00:17:55,728 --> 00:17:58,989
Speaker 1: Hold on That's less than an episode of freedom cup noodle.

307
00:18:00,611 --> 00:18:05,710
Speaker 0: It contains back in the fast lane revved up and winter Olympics, huh?

308
00:18:07,232 --> 00:18:19,038
Speaker 1: It's still a better deal than freedom cup noodle, but not by much Things of the day.

309
00:18:19,058 --> 00:18:20,103
Speaker 0: Hey rim.

310
00:18:20,425 --> 00:18:21,450
Speaker 0: Do you have your own blog?

311
00:18:22,251 --> 00:18:25,750
Speaker 1: Actually, I was gonna ask you to put one on the up on our server.

312
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:29,950
Speaker 0: I will as soon as I as soon as I switch it over to the Ubuntu.

313
00:18:30,231 --> 00:18:33,179
Speaker 0: But if you had your own blog, would you read it?

314
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,930
Speaker 1: probably otherwise, why am I doing it exactly now?

315
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,016
Speaker 0: This is a website.

316
00:18:38,056 --> 00:18:40,490
Speaker 0: I'm linking to is my thing of the day is a pretty shady site.

317
00:18:40,550 --> 00:19:00,955
Speaker 0: It's one of those SEO sites that where they tell you how to you know, get more people to come while that BS right but it actually does have on this site a semi serious blog on the topic and this guy his name is Ahmed Bilal and He wrote a very short thing and the short thing that he wrote is really good And that's the only reason I'm linking to it.

318
00:19:01,497 --> 00:19:05,170
Speaker 0: He says would you read your own blog if you wrote a blog?

319
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:06,754
Speaker 0: Would you read it?

320
00:19:06,814 --> 00:19:08,179
Speaker 0: Would you subscribe to it and read it?

321
00:19:08,621 --> 00:19:10,729
Speaker 0: If not, then why are you doing it?

322
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,701
Speaker 0: What's what the hell's the point if you don't want to read it?

323
00:19:13,882 --> 00:19:15,830
Speaker 0: No one else freaking wants to read it either.

324
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:22,702
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean granted you have to take it with a little bit of grand assault that you might not want to read something that you Just wrote.

325
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:23,409
Speaker 1: that sort of yes.

326
00:19:23,631 --> 00:19:33,662
Speaker 0: This is why also in the short bit He gives you a test and he says a simple way to test whether your blog provides value to the community is to put Yourself in the shoes of your readers and ask yourself the following questions ready.

327
00:19:34,425 --> 00:19:35,630
Speaker 0: one is the blog unique?

328
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:38,789
Speaker 0: Does it provide any information that I cannot find anywhere else?

329
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:39,908
Speaker 1: How many blogs?

330
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:45,929
Speaker 1: Literally don't do anything except post everything that engadget posts and then add like one comment or they.

331
00:19:46,069 --> 00:19:47,273
Speaker 0: you know Someone reads dig.

332
00:19:47,434 --> 00:19:56,268
Speaker 0: they find the comments the the links on dig every day that they enjoy and then they write a little thing About them that there should have been a comment on dig but instead a separate blog.

333
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:00,709
Speaker 1: now Why would you go to that when you can just go to day and read the comments?

334
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,076
Speaker 0: To is the blog original?

335
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:08,510
Speaker 0: does it offer personal opinion instead of regurgitating or echoing views that other people share?

336
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:17,063
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of people when they write their opinion of something or just sort of like, you know They're sort of joining the crew on one side or the other.

337
00:20:17,143 --> 00:20:19,090
Speaker 0: so it was like a ps3 or we thing.

338
00:20:19,371 --> 00:20:19,872
Speaker 0: They'll just be.

339
00:20:19,973 --> 00:20:21,056
Speaker 0: they'll write a blog post.

340
00:20:21,076 --> 00:20:23,083
Speaker 0: That's like we is awesome or we sucks.

341
00:20:23,103 --> 00:20:25,250
Speaker 0: They won't be saying anything new about it.

342
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,535
Speaker 0: Yeah, a point that had.

343
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:30,330
Speaker 0: all you do is make a few points that aren't in the debate already or be funny.

344
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:32,077
Speaker 1: There's always the option of being funny.

345
00:20:32,177 --> 00:20:32,438
Speaker 0: Yeah.

346
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:32,941
Speaker 0: Yeah funny.

347
00:20:33,001 --> 00:20:37,790
Speaker 1: I mean if you're writing about mudkips, maybe you like him Maybe you don't like him, but you got to say something about him.

348
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:41,061
Speaker 1: Maybe make a joke about a mudkip maybe have an insightful like.

349
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:43,469
Speaker 1: well mudkips are actually useful for blah blah blah.

350
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:47,969
Speaker 0: Yes, you have to say something that no one else is saying regardless of whether.

351
00:20:49,351 --> 00:20:53,022
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, the third thing he says is the blog essential?

352
00:20:53,403 --> 00:20:57,767
Speaker 0: if I unsubscribe from this blog today What would I lose out on?

353
00:20:59,032 --> 00:20:59,916
Speaker 0: Yeah, see I look.

354
00:20:59,936 --> 00:21:10,035
Speaker 0: that's how I look at my RSS subscriptions is you know I whenever I I go down the list of things I'm subscribed to and I say if I unsubscribe from this What would I be losing?

355
00:21:10,617 --> 00:21:16,278
Speaker 0: and most of the time when I act when I actually bother to ask myself that question Like a bunch of things.

356
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:26,262
Speaker 1: Yeah, I went through that with podcasts like three or four times where I'd look at a podcast that I'd been listening to and I Think did I actually enjoy listening to that and all the time?

357
00:21:26,443 --> 00:21:27,046
Speaker 1: No, I didn't.

358
00:21:27,467 --> 00:21:27,829
Speaker 0: and why?

359
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:28,795
Speaker 0: yeah It's like.

360
00:21:28,936 --> 00:21:31,352
Speaker 0: it's so weird that this whole subscription thing You have all the.

361
00:21:31,412 --> 00:21:41,810
Speaker 0: you subscribe to all these things and you listen to them or read them or maybe you don't but you subscribe To them and if you just look at them, you know casually you're just used to seeing them there and your subscription list.

362
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:49,189
Speaker 1: Yeah, like pen radio did that I got kind of sick of pen radio for a good two months fan But the episodes kept coming.

363
00:21:49,522 --> 00:21:56,730
Speaker 0: Yeah But if you actually carefully consider the things you subscribe to you'll find that a lot of things will be off your list mighty quick.

364
00:21:57,172 --> 00:21:58,679
Speaker 1: Yep, a lot of thing on geek nights.

365
00:21:58,961 --> 00:22:00,810
Speaker 1: A lot of things are very redundant.

366
00:22:00,991 --> 00:22:08,929
Speaker 1: I mean if I read dig and Fark I don't need to ever go to slash dot because everything on slash dot will be on one of those two.

367
00:22:09,231 --> 00:22:14,890
Speaker 0: Yep, so this is just a word to everyone out there who blogs or podcasts or anything of the sort.

368
00:22:15,414 --> 00:22:21,543
Speaker 0: Think about whether you would read Your blogger listen to your own podcast if you weren't the one making.

369
00:22:21,604 --> 00:22:25,898
Speaker 0: if someone else was making the exact same thing You're making would you subscribe and listen to it?

370
00:22:25,938 --> 00:22:29,590
Speaker 0: If the answer is no, you should probably change what you're doing.

371
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:33,143
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I am thinking about having a blog just lately.

372
00:22:33,223 --> 00:22:34,107
Speaker 1: I never really had one.

373
00:22:34,127 --> 00:22:43,528
Speaker 1: I had the slash job thing I think I posted in it twice Uh-huh, and I think one of the things I posted I also published in the awesome newspaper at our IT.

374
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,252
Speaker 0: Oh So awesome.

375
00:22:45,393 --> 00:22:46,095
Speaker 1: Remember that thing?

376
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:47,640
Speaker 1: I actually got hate mail for that.

377
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,161
Speaker 1: Yep.

378
00:22:48,542 --> 00:22:49,024
Speaker 0: That was cool.

379
00:22:49,405 --> 00:22:51,934
Speaker 1: Yeah, I generally yeah I'm not gonna get into that.

380
00:22:52,054 --> 00:22:54,425
Speaker 1: That's a story for another day a whole episode on that.

381
00:22:54,505 --> 00:22:55,570
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah, we should.

382
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:56,173
Speaker 0: What's your thing?

383
00:22:56,213 --> 00:22:59,610
Speaker 1: But I've just been feeling this desire to blog lately.

384
00:22:59,931 --> 00:23:04,510
Speaker 1: I have things to say that really don't fit into geek nights or maybe I don't want to say them out loud.

385
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:09,940
Speaker 1: I'd rather write them and now that I got a flicker and Now that my delicious and my dig streams.

386
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:13,202
Speaker 1: I could combine them all into one and have just the rim feed Sounds good.

387
00:23:13,628 --> 00:23:22,589
Speaker 1: Yep anyway my thing of the day is very much germane to the topic mostly because I couldn't think of a thing of the day and Everything I looked at on the internet today was totally lame.

388
00:23:23,293 --> 00:23:26,790
Speaker 1: So this is the video that inspired us to do tonight's episode.

389
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:32,388
Speaker 1: It is a video with Lonnie Johnson the man who created the super soaker the man who in?

390
00:23:32,388 --> 00:23:39,222
Speaker 1: 1989 57 or 58 revolutionized the world of water sports.

391
00:23:39,342 --> 00:23:46,041
Speaker 1: and by water sports, I mean Squirt guns not swimming and diving.

392
00:23:46,522 --> 00:23:52,122
Speaker 1: see many of you might be too young to remember this But there was a time when squirt guns sucks.

393
00:23:52,423 --> 00:23:54,170
Speaker 0: It's like most of my life.

394
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:59,170
Speaker 0: No, not most of my life, but a significant portion of my life pretty much every year until I was fifth grade.

395
00:23:59,371 --> 00:23:59,491
Speaker 0: It's

396
00:23:59,531 --> 00:24:22,090
Speaker 1: kind of like the cavemen who didn't have any tools yet the monkeys and they're just rolling around doing their monkey thing and then You know when they have a monkey war They just kind of claw and bite at each other and one day one of the monkeys picks up a stick and he hits another monkey with the stick and that stick is so Superior to any weapon the monkey had ever had before that he is now effectively a new being in warfare.

397
00:24:22,432 --> 00:24:24,624
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, let's talk about this video and then get into it.

398
00:24:25,147 --> 00:24:29,370
Speaker 0: in the video It shows the guy who invented the super soaker and it tells you how he invented it.

399
00:24:29,811 --> 00:24:33,466
Speaker 0: He was like working at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory or something like that.

400
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:45,089
Speaker 0: He was some sort of genius And he ended up accidentally Discussed, you know, he was playing with water or something and it scored it out and he said hey What if I use that principle to make a water gun?

401
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:49,588
Speaker 1: You know what proof that the space program is infinitely valuable to human culture.

402
00:24:49,889 --> 00:25:05,447
Speaker 0: Yes So he invented the super soaker and with all the money He made from inventing the super soaker and selling the patent to Laramie the company that made the super soaker physically He bought himself a lab and he never has to work again except for fun in his own personal lab.

403
00:25:05,488 --> 00:25:09,856
Speaker 1: now see this guy exemplifies Everything that people should aspire to.

404
00:25:09,917 --> 00:25:13,810
Speaker 1: not only did he do something that well not only a he was a genius.

405
00:25:13,951 --> 00:25:18,510
Speaker 1: Well, he did something that impacted the world in a tangible way for a lot of people.

406
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:29,970
Speaker 1: I mean he didn't end hunger or cure AIDS But he created something that did not exist at all and he revolutionized a small But I'd say important to my childhood industry.

407
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:33,863
Speaker 0: It was it was actually an invention and worthy of patents do?

408
00:25:34,265 --> 00:25:42,550
Speaker 1: he made a bunch of money off of it And instead of just pissing the money way or doing whatever he put that money toward his worthwhile pursuits.

409
00:25:42,951 --> 00:25:44,617
Speaker 1: He put the money into having a lab.

410
00:25:44,858 --> 00:25:54,455
Speaker 1: just like if I had a million dollars, I'd make a real recording studio And I would make a computer lab and a video game lab and many other labs I just like.

411
00:25:54,496 --> 00:25:56,968
Speaker 0: where my lab coat and not much else.

412
00:25:58,096 --> 00:26:04,380
Speaker 0: Okay I'll just let you it was a Lewis black joke.

413
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,756
Speaker 0: Remember he was like I did the experiment in my laboratory Oh the lab coat at the time.

414
00:26:10,097 --> 00:26:11,040
Speaker 1: I do recall that.

415
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:11,441
Speaker 1: Yes.

416
00:26:11,521 --> 00:26:13,146
Speaker 1: I do recall that Lewis black joke.

417
00:26:13,206 --> 00:26:14,590
Speaker 0: anybody listen so black.

418
00:26:15,792 --> 00:26:19,494
Speaker 1: There was a time when squirt gun fights Consisted.

419
00:26:19,514 --> 00:26:22,989
Speaker 1: there were basically three different levels of squirt gun and that was it.

420
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:26,390
Speaker 1: first There was the 50 cent or dime squirt gun.

421
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:29,100
Speaker 0: This is pretty much the only squirt gun I had until the super soaker existed.

422
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,890
Speaker 1: It was a little clear plastic thing.

423
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:32,071
Speaker 1: It was.

424
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:35,021
Speaker 1: they were like bright green transparent or pink.

425
00:26:35,423 --> 00:26:37,470
Speaker 0: yellow is shaped like a gun.

426
00:26:37,551 --> 00:26:44,224
Speaker 0: It looked like a real gun in shape But it was some clear pat plastic and you popped open a little hole in the back

427
00:26:44,304 --> 00:26:51,209
Speaker 1: with this piss poor little white Plug that had a little T on the end of it that kept it from falling out even though it always fell and

428
00:26:51,229 --> 00:26:56,368
Speaker 0: you would Turn the kitchen sink faucet on real low so that it would drip into there to fill it at the maximum rate and

429
00:26:56,408 --> 00:26:57,473
Speaker 1: you'd stand There or you

430
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:57,996
Speaker 0: use a funnel.

431
00:26:58,096 --> 00:27:06,715
Speaker 0: you'd stand there for like 10 minutes trying to fill the stupid thing And when you finally filled it and plugged it up you would squirt it and it worked at the same mechanism as like a spray Bottle of glass plus.

432
00:27:06,775 --> 00:27:06,956
Speaker 0: Yes.

433
00:27:07,237 --> 00:27:10,932
Speaker 1: The thing is you had to pump it or squirt it a bunch of times before it even works at All.

434
00:27:11,073 --> 00:27:13,270
Speaker 0: yeah, we had to squirt on the air out before it would squirt water.

435
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:17,406
Speaker 0: Yeah, the same way you have to pump like a liquid soap before the soap actually comes out.

436
00:27:17,467 --> 00:27:22,184
Speaker 1: these things shot I don't know maybe 11 feet and they shoot very far at all.

437
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:23,650
Speaker 0: They shot this piddling amount of water.

438
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:28,225
Speaker 1: It was so little water that if you got shot with it, you didn't even notice squirt.

439
00:27:28,245 --> 00:27:29,690
Speaker 0: You didn't even notice or care.

440
00:27:29,831 --> 00:27:30,835
Speaker 1: I mean squirt gun fights.

441
00:27:31,137 --> 00:27:49,950
Speaker 1: when I was a kid with these before the super soaker came around Effectively always ended in either some kid bringing a hose God I swear to God this kid David we were having a little squirt gun fight and Dave well, basically we realized that with these little squirt guns The only real tactic was to shoot other kids in the eye.

442
00:27:50,513 --> 00:27:52,683
Speaker 0: The eye I was about to say the ear is good too.

443
00:27:52,703 --> 00:27:54,090
Speaker 0: If you get real close here is good.

444
00:27:54,331 --> 00:27:55,477
Speaker 1: The eye was pretty much.

445
00:27:55,497 --> 00:27:56,401
Speaker 0: eyes is the weak spot.

446
00:27:56,421 --> 00:27:57,687
Speaker 0: That's what gets the boss down.

447
00:27:58,029 --> 00:28:02,170
Speaker 1: Yep So this kid we're having a little squirt gun fight and can't shot in the eye like eight times.

448
00:28:02,494 --> 00:28:03,670
Speaker 1: So he just ran away.

449
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:06,139
Speaker 1: We're like, ah, it's so much for him and we're fighting.

450
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,350
Speaker 1: we're fighting and for fighting and we see him run around the corner.

451
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:13,243
Speaker 1: He's it wasn't that far away like 20 minutes later and he's got something.

452
00:28:13,604 --> 00:28:23,547
Speaker 1: and then we see we realized at the last Second when we're all it's already too late that he is connected like for extension hoses to his house And that kid owned us.

453
00:28:25,012 --> 00:28:26,928
Speaker 0: Why didn't he just use it at the house you were at?

454
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,179
Speaker 1: Because we would have noticed and stopped him.

455
00:28:29,219 --> 00:28:30,686
Speaker 1: there's rules about that sort of thing.

456
00:28:30,706 --> 00:28:32,676
Speaker 1: if someone went for the hose That's a stabbing.

457
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,790
Speaker 0: See you even in the super soaker days You would go for the hose.

458
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:42,070
Speaker 0: The hose is the ultimate weapon in water fights and you always go for the hose no matter what it always gets down to the hose.

459
00:28:42,191 --> 00:28:45,454
Speaker 0: Eventually, you might as well go for it right away But without the hose.

460
00:28:45,816 --> 00:28:49,390
Speaker 0: the bet even better than a super soaker was the water balloon, which has always existed.

461
00:28:49,632 --> 00:28:51,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, except for having to clean up after the water balloon.

462
00:28:51,911 --> 00:28:55,590
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is they always had those ones that were shaped like grenades and look like grenade.

463
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:56,734
Speaker 1: Those are the worst.

464
00:28:56,774 --> 00:29:01,630
Speaker 0: worst ones that they're meant to be water balloons, but they're the worst at being water balloons.

465
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:06,570
Speaker 1: For some reason they always broke when I tried to fill them, but when I throw them at people they just bounced off.

466
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,509
Speaker 0: Yeah my favorite thing actually to do is to get the long ones the ones the clowns use and then you throw them.

467
00:29:11,529 --> 00:29:13,999
Speaker 1: they kind of Spin in the air and wrap around someone's face.

468
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:16,530
Speaker 0: Well, no that I put one like down my pant leg.

469
00:29:16,691 --> 00:29:18,142
Speaker 0: Well, I guess it'd be summer.

470
00:29:18,163 --> 00:29:18,929
Speaker 0: I have a short leg.

471
00:29:21,272 --> 00:29:27,508
Speaker 0: Sneak up on someone and you rip it out and you smack them with it While I did often smack people with them.

472
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:33,066
Speaker 1: But I usually have it like stuck to myself somewhere like tied on a little piece of floss or string.

473
00:29:33,126 --> 00:29:40,529
Speaker 1: you see that would break off and Depends or I just I carry one like a sword and then I have my little bag full of the normal one.

474
00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:44,689
Speaker 0: if you carried It like a sword it would bend over because it was too heavy and then it would just break wouldn't break.

475
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,590
Speaker 1: You gotta get quality water balloon.

476
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:49,738
Speaker 0: I guess if your balloon is quality enough Then it won't break.

477
00:29:49,879 --> 00:29:57,450
Speaker 1: see the problem was when they were too quality They'd either not break when you threw him at someone or you'd have to fill him to the such a breaking point.

478
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:02,325
Speaker 1: It was such an amount of water that they'd either hurt someone or just break on you.

479
00:30:02,526 --> 00:30:03,629
Speaker 0: hurting someone is great.

480
00:30:04,212 --> 00:30:06,665
Speaker 0: Yeah, how many times have I held a water balloon in my hand?

481
00:30:06,686 --> 00:30:07,389
Speaker 0: They would just break it.

482
00:30:08,632 --> 00:30:09,361
Speaker 0: That's the worst.

483
00:30:09,665 --> 00:30:10,090
Speaker 1: That's the thing.

484
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:16,441
Speaker 1: It's like those weapons in video games that damage someone else a lot But they have a chance of damaging you just as much.

485
00:30:16,501 --> 00:30:23,790
Speaker 0: I don't have a link but there's a video that was on the internet Recently somewhere that showed a guy getting hit directly in the face of the water balloon in like super slow mo.

486
00:30:24,013 --> 00:30:24,601
Speaker 1: It was all right.

487
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:31,467
Speaker 1: So so these guns obviously sucked and basically it was like the ancient Greeks having war.

488
00:30:31,767 --> 00:30:32,730
Speaker 1: it wasn't advance.

489
00:30:33,011 --> 00:30:34,918
Speaker 1: The war was kind of this honor bound.

490
00:30:35,199 --> 00:30:44,161
Speaker 1: the kids all line up and you basically would run up to another kid put the squirt Gun in their eye and pulled the trigger as much as possible And then they would cover their eye run away come back and do the same thing.

491
00:30:44,181 --> 00:30:44,683
Speaker 0: your finger

492
00:30:44,703 --> 00:30:45,928
Speaker 1: would start hurting because the

493
00:30:46,068 --> 00:30:47,934
Speaker 0: only thing We're not ergonomic at all No

494
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:48,632
Speaker 1: They weren't

495
00:30:48,692 --> 00:30:54,649
Speaker 0: and you had to keep pulling the trigger to squirt like you'd pull the trigger once and go squirt any good thing Let go and pull it again

496
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:59,650
Speaker 1: And you pull it harder and squirt it harder and they broke and on the beach they get sand in him and stop working.

497
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:05,058
Speaker 0: I mean literally you would buy a big sack of these things from the dollar store because they were maybe Half of them in.

498
00:31:05,098 --> 00:31:06,509
Speaker 1: the sack would work at all Yeah.

499
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:13,418
Speaker 1: And then during the fight you'd have to have like four in your pocket because otherwise they'd break and you would but the one in Your pocket would inevitably leak down your pants.

500
00:31:13,699 --> 00:31:16,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, so god they'd leak her on your hand while you were shooting.

501
00:31:16,371 --> 00:31:22,419
Speaker 0: So sometime around fourth or fifth grade, which must have been I don't know what year I'm not even gonna bother to figure it out sometime in the 90s.

502
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,804
Speaker 0: Maybe the late 80s.

503
00:31:24,406 --> 00:31:25,610
Speaker 0: I saw it in the circular.

504
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:28,944
Speaker 1: Oh, you're not gonna talk about the other better squirt guns that like the evolution.

505
00:31:29,084 --> 00:31:29,406
Speaker 0: Okay.

506
00:31:29,426 --> 00:31:31,510
Speaker 1: Well, okay briefly We won't go into detail.

507
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:36,247
Speaker 0: Like there were squirt guns that were battery powered and these are a kind of crazy and cool.

508
00:31:36,287 --> 00:31:39,742
Speaker 0: kids had them But they actually sucked worse than the sucky ones.

509
00:31:40,084 --> 00:31:41,450
Speaker 1: They were always shaped like an Uzi.

510
00:31:41,591 --> 00:31:47,949
Speaker 0: They were shaped like an Uzi and they were bright orange Usually and you'd fill them with water and you put two batteries in the in where the bullets would go on an Uzi.

511
00:31:47,969 --> 00:31:53,239
Speaker 1: in the Actually mine you had Magazines with holes in and that you filled with water.

512
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:54,102
Speaker 1: Oh, that's plan.

513
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:54,745
Speaker 0: That's real bad.

514
00:31:54,825 --> 00:31:55,828
Speaker 1: Anyway, it was all bad.

515
00:31:55,969 --> 00:31:56,650
Speaker 1: Awesome Yeah

516
00:31:57,152 --> 00:32:08,810
Speaker 0: And you would pull the trigger on it and we go tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick and it would basically shoot wussier shittier squirts than the handheld Finger-powered one, but it would shoot a lot of them and you could just hold the trigger down.

517
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:10,921
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course battery would run out real quick.

518
00:32:10,961 --> 00:32:12,690
Speaker 1: The battery lasted like two minutes.

519
00:32:12,851 --> 00:32:16,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was such an inefficient electric motor in there with the shittiest pump.

520
00:32:17,617 --> 00:32:18,650
Speaker 1: These things were expensive.

521
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:19,807
Speaker 1: I mean think about it.

522
00:32:20,211 --> 00:32:24,728
Speaker 1: These things were like 10 or 15 dollars and a normal squirt gun was like 10 cents.

523
00:32:25,552 --> 00:32:28,663
Speaker 0: And the other thing is these things mostly broke pretty quickly.

524
00:32:29,004 --> 00:32:30,630
Speaker 0: after two water fights you threw it out.

525
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:34,363
Speaker 1: The first one I got broke in the car on the way home.

526
00:32:34,664 --> 00:32:40,504
Speaker 1: Oh man, I cried And we took it back to the store like right away.

527
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:42,503
Speaker 1: cuz I was in Consolable.

528
00:32:44,355 --> 00:32:48,146
Speaker 1: I got another one and I was so careful with it and I brought it to his work on fight.

529
00:32:48,347 --> 00:32:49,330
Speaker 1: and I'm shooting some kid.

530
00:32:49,411 --> 00:32:49,956
Speaker 0: It broke.

531
00:32:50,381 --> 00:32:51,270
Speaker 1: it didn't break right away.

532
00:32:51,351 --> 00:32:59,049
Speaker 1: I shot him like four times and then He hit it with his squirt gun and it broke and the end broke off and all the water went.

533
00:32:59,089 --> 00:33:02,450
Speaker 0: push See what I always wondered is why doesn't someone make a squirt gun, right?

534
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:16,564
Speaker 0: where there's a tank of water about some sort of battery a trigger and One of those the thing that's kind of water squirting motor that they use to spray windshield wiper on your windshield Cuz that's pretty much a constant stream of water.

535
00:33:16,585 --> 00:33:17,490
Speaker 0: That's pretty powerful.

536
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:21,625
Speaker 1: Why don't you just have the equivalent of a super soaker with the equivalent of an air compressor?

537
00:33:21,645 --> 00:33:22,770
Speaker 0: that would work, too.

538
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:25,702
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway, so then the only other kind of squirt gun.

539
00:33:26,064 --> 00:33:27,108
Speaker 0: Oh the one we go.

540
00:33:27,128 --> 00:33:31,730
Speaker 1: Yep Yep, Scott just demonstrated it, but the only other weapon these are the one shot.

541
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:34,820
Speaker 1: These are ancient Greeks and this was like the spear.

542
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,870
Speaker 0: that the one shot actually is still a great squirt gun.

543
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,603
Speaker 0: And if you can find them, I don't think they make them.

544
00:33:39,744 --> 00:33:40,509
Speaker 1: I'm saying I see him.

545
00:33:40,831 --> 00:33:50,820
Speaker 1: It's basically a bazooka where it's long tube and you stick it in water the nozzle and you pull it and now you have got a tube of water a large cylinder of water.

546
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,355
Speaker 1: and the thing is they're always ever like there'd be one or two kids never squirt gun fight who would have?

547
00:33:55,375 --> 00:34:04,309
Speaker 1: you know, all the little squirt guns and they give thick thick thick thick thick thick at each other and Then there's always be the couple kids that also on their back had one full bazooka.

548
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:05,694
Speaker 0: Yeah, see now the bazooka.

549
00:34:06,276 --> 00:34:10,389
Speaker 0: I sort of equate it to sledding with a dish as opposed to sledding with a sled.

550
00:34:10,934 --> 00:34:13,090
Speaker 0: It's like the bazooka is this weird water gun?

551
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:23,399
Speaker 0: It's not like the other water guns But actually it can do a lot more than it looks like it can do just like the sledding dish can go real fast Even though it's different from everyone else with their normal sleds.

552
00:34:23,438 --> 00:34:34,790
Speaker 1: whenever the kid dropped his sidearm and pulled that thing out Everyone would pause and back up because you knew he only had one shot But you didn't want to be the one shot with it cuz that thing got you wet.

553
00:34:35,295 --> 00:34:36,750
Speaker 1: It was the only squirt gun that got you.

554
00:34:36,772 --> 00:34:36,925
Speaker 1: Yes

555
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:51,188
Speaker 0: Cuz the thing about it is even when super soakers came out the bazooka was still a useful weapon because you would basically Pull the two ends of it together and he would fire the entire Cylinder of water like almost a gallon of water at once at one person real

556
00:34:51,268 --> 00:34:51,690
Speaker 1: fast.

557
00:34:52,172 --> 00:34:53,980
Speaker 0: It was a wasn't like you could do about.

558
00:34:54,021 --> 00:34:54,824
Speaker 1: it was awesome.

559
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:55,949
Speaker 0: It's still awesome.

560
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was definitely a valid part of any.

561
00:34:59,381 --> 00:34:59,803
Speaker 1: you know what.

562
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:02,050
Speaker 1: it's one of those weapons that stood the test of time.

563
00:35:02,231 --> 00:35:05,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, so one day, you know when you're a kid you look at the toy circular.

564
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:09,653
Speaker 0: The newspaper comes on the weekend and there's a little advertisement that says hey Here's all the toys.

565
00:35:09,673 --> 00:35:14,433
Speaker 0: that toys are us or toy works or kb or wherever your toy store is and you look through that for new Toys you go.

566
00:35:14,474 --> 00:35:15,561
Speaker 0: Ooh, I want that action figure.

567
00:35:15,622 --> 00:35:16,810
Speaker 0: Ooh, look at those new video games.

568
00:35:17,233 --> 00:35:24,289
Speaker 0: It's actually how I found out about new video games before Video game magazines that I was looking at toy circular and look at the pictures of the video games.

569
00:35:25,431 --> 00:35:29,350
Speaker 0: Anyway, I saw a water gun in there, but it was all weird-looking.

570
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:34,457
Speaker 0: It was first of all is yellow and green and I was like what and had this weird Bulb on it.

571
00:35:34,598 --> 00:35:36,130
Speaker 1: It looked like an alien weapon.

572
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:40,209
Speaker 0: It did look like an alien ray gun and I said I looked at the picture and I said that's corny as hell.

573
00:35:40,229 --> 00:35:41,395
Speaker 0: who that Would want that thing?

574
00:35:41,918 --> 00:35:42,641
Speaker 0: and I didn't want it.

575
00:35:42,923 --> 00:35:44,310
Speaker 1: It was also expensive.

576
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:48,926
Speaker 1: I mean every kid knew that those Uzi's were crap because every kid had one and then it broke.

577
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:51,016
Speaker 1: so it was still you know $1 work it.

578
00:35:51,057 --> 00:35:52,044
Speaker 1: maybe you get the $2 nicer one.

579
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,695
Speaker 1: I was made out of slightly thicker plastic.

580
00:35:55,136 --> 00:36:00,170
Speaker 1: what kid was gonna convince their parents to drop 25 bucks on a squirt gun?

581
00:36:00,715 --> 00:36:03,115
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was like good $25.

582
00:36:03,115 --> 00:36:04,522
Speaker 0: my mom's not gonna buy me that.

583
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:05,326
Speaker 0: what the hell.

584
00:36:05,346 --> 00:36:05,969
Speaker 0: there's no way.

585
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:12,210
Speaker 0: So, of course eventually a kid on the street got a Super Soaker 50.

586
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:16,146
Speaker 0: I don't know why they started with calling it the 50 as if there was a Super Soaker before the 50.

587
00:36:16,146 --> 00:36:19,618
Speaker 1: so they Because then they made the 25.

588
00:36:19,618 --> 00:36:23,129
Speaker 0: Oh, that's right that I remember why they called it 50. because it could supposedly shoot 50 feet.

589
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:28,106
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the hundred gets you a hundred feet and supposedly could shoot about 80 feet.

590
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,290
Speaker 0: It could shoot pretty damn far.

591
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:31,603
Speaker 0: I mean you really had to get that thing going.

592
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:36,704
Speaker 0: to get it shoot the number of feet It was advertised at shooting but it could shoot hella far.

593
00:36:36,965 --> 00:36:46,590
Speaker 1: to give you an idea What the first squirt gun fight where a kid came with the Super Soaker was like when Shaka Zulu?

594
00:36:47,351 --> 00:36:51,645
Speaker 1: Broke the rules of warfare ran over to the other side and killed all those dudes.

595
00:36:51,785 --> 00:36:55,410
Speaker 0: It was like the in being Invention of the Maxim machine gun.

596
00:36:55,811 --> 00:37:04,990
Speaker 1: It's like in the myth in the middle of a Roman battle between the Romans and the Persians One guy walked over with a sawed-off shot gun.

597
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:11,169
Speaker 0: Yeah, see I remembered the first battle in which he kid down the street had the service ochre 50 and we did not.

598
00:37:12,152 --> 00:37:18,797
Speaker 0: we ended up running to the house a lot getting lots of water balloons coming out and running back into the house because Basically, he couldn't be stopped.

599
00:37:19,178 --> 00:37:22,550
Speaker 0: He wasn't by far the best water fight kind of her.

600
00:37:22,711 --> 00:37:24,742
Speaker 1: He didn't have that get it in your eyes skill.

601
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:26,230
Speaker 1: No, I didn't need it anymore.

602
00:37:26,431 --> 00:37:30,430
Speaker 0: He had an automatic weapon by sheer possession of weaponry alone.

603
00:37:30,671 --> 00:37:35,712
Speaker 0: Nobody even like five kids were no match for the one kid with the Super Soaker 50.

604
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:37,339
Speaker 1: I mean we'd all thought all right.

605
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,585
Speaker 1: He's gonna run out of water.

606
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:39,670
Speaker 1: Look how much water he's shooting.

607
00:37:39,751 --> 00:37:43,800
Speaker 0: Good God, if we had a whole tank of water We had a tiny gun of.

608
00:37:43,941 --> 00:37:47,770
Speaker 1: if we all just surround him He can't get us all and he would just get us all anyway.

609
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:51,123
Speaker 1: Cuz it shot so much water and it never seemed to stop shooting.

610
00:37:51,544 --> 00:37:55,140
Speaker 0: and if he needed to stop He would be go to the hose to get water.

611
00:37:55,180 --> 00:38:00,910
Speaker 1: and where you would never approach someone at the hose See what we always did is we always took the shooting thing off the hose.

612
00:38:01,432 --> 00:38:04,850
Speaker 0: So it was just uh, yeah, so you put your thumb on it cuz you're not an idiot.

613
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,982
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the thumb method wasn't that effective.

614
00:38:07,022 --> 00:38:08,430
Speaker 0: and you suck at the thumb method.

615
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:14,910
Speaker 1: No Why it's not that effective cuz it's real easy to run over and just grab the kids hand and now he's soaking wet.

616
00:38:15,311 --> 00:38:16,094
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's fine.

617
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:16,776
Speaker 0: That's fine.

618
00:38:16,997 --> 00:38:17,258
Speaker 1: Of course.

619
00:38:17,278 --> 00:38:20,890
Speaker 1: Some kids would bring those special like nine different nozzle attachments.

620
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:21,889
Speaker 0: Those ones are no good.

621
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:30,544
Speaker 0: The only the only ones that are good at this that straight ones because they have the best Single jet of high-power mode that the multi mode ones don't have.

622
00:38:30,785 --> 00:38:32,530
Speaker 1: or sometimes we just get rid of the hose.

623
00:38:32,691 --> 00:38:34,262
Speaker 1: It was just all the faucets on the house.

624
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:38,290
Speaker 1: Ooh Cuz then if you were really desperate you put your thumb on that thing.

625
00:38:38,451 --> 00:38:41,930
Speaker 0: Well, actually remember there were a lot of different systems that they eventually invented.

626
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:47,010
Speaker 0: We'd put a thing a special thing at the end of the hose and you would stick the front of your water gun into it.

627
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:47,996
Speaker 0: It would fill your water gun.

628
00:38:48,479 --> 00:38:49,485
Speaker 0: Those came a lot later.

629
00:38:49,525 --> 00:38:54,267
Speaker 0: I never tried them So I don't know how reliable they are, but supposedly I guess they still sell them.

630
00:38:54,407 --> 00:38:55,795
Speaker 1: I got to say though This is a side.

631
00:38:55,815 --> 00:38:56,983
Speaker 1: We're not talking about water balloons.

632
00:38:57,003 --> 00:39:03,067
Speaker 1: That's beyond the scope Yeah, but nothing was worse than trying to fill water balloons with a full-on hose.

633
00:39:03,368 --> 00:39:10,290
Speaker 0: It was just like You had to fill it at a sink in the house and then put him in like a trash bag and carry him outside.

634
00:39:10,531 --> 00:39:13,489
Speaker 1: Yeah, plus the enemy of the hose was always the kink in the hose.

635
00:39:16,433 --> 00:39:19,150
Speaker 1: But the super soaker kid was unstoppable.

636
00:39:19,593 --> 00:39:22,330
Speaker 0: He was a centurion in full armor and I had sticks.

637
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:33,470
Speaker 0: So as in every other arms race in the history of man Everyone else as soon as one kid and your block had a super soaker Everyone had to get one or be eternally wet.

638
00:39:34,132 --> 00:39:39,148
Speaker 1: Yep, and the thing is all right now everyone had one and the playing field was equalized.

639
00:39:39,188 --> 00:39:45,590
Speaker 1: but now Super soaker changed the nature of squirt gun warfare because now we were all equal again.

640
00:39:46,011 --> 00:39:49,244
Speaker 1: But water fights had this completely different dimension.

641
00:39:49,324 --> 00:39:50,890
Speaker 0: You'd be far away from people.

642
00:39:51,352 --> 00:39:52,957
Speaker 0: Everyone would get soaking wet.

643
00:39:53,399 --> 00:39:56,389
Speaker 0: Everyone would take a break at the same time to refill their water.

644
00:39:57,552 --> 00:39:58,696
Speaker 0: It was you would be far.

645
00:39:58,716 --> 00:40:00,202
Speaker 0: you run around a lot more.

646
00:40:00,503 --> 00:40:02,290
Speaker 0: you wouldn't have to get right up in people's faces.

647
00:40:02,832 --> 00:40:04,118
Speaker 0: People would stop to pump.

648
00:40:04,581 --> 00:40:05,525
Speaker 0: It was kind of crazy.

649
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:06,610
Speaker 1: I pumped continuously.

650
00:40:07,012 --> 00:40:08,096
Speaker 1: I also stopped pump.

651
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:19,430
Speaker 1: I also pumped continuously, but that meant you ran out of water faster, which well I wasn't shooting continuous Even if I wasn't shooting was always pumping right until I heard that little valve thing inside the pressure release start releasing.

652
00:40:19,552 --> 00:40:21,259
Speaker 1: Then I knew that I'd pumped it to the max Mmm.

653
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:33,768
Speaker 1: I realized later after I had long since lost and broken all my super soakers and gone to college that I could have just Gotten rid of that valve and made a super soaker that was either real powerful or would have broken.

654
00:40:34,129 --> 00:40:37,702
Speaker 0: Yep Yeah, so when did you actually go and get your super?

655
00:40:37,722 --> 00:40:39,650
Speaker 0: so your mom just like get you one or pretty much?

656
00:40:40,152 --> 00:40:43,918
Speaker 1: I think my parents actually said hey There's this new super soaker and I didn't care.

657
00:40:43,938 --> 00:40:47,330
Speaker 1: and then I came back from the first work on fight where someone had one.

658
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:53,513
Speaker 1: I was like I need a super soaker and my parents said alright, then they got me a super soaker 50 Yeah, see.

659
00:40:53,673 --> 00:41:01,010
Speaker 0: and then he had a different situation where because like I said, I wasn't into it right away I didn't really want one when they were available.

660
00:41:01,191 --> 00:41:05,370
Speaker 0: And then it's all the other kids figured out the day before me and they were sold out everywhere.

661
00:41:05,531 --> 00:41:08,187
Speaker 1: So you showed up just fights and you didn't have a super soaker.

662
00:41:08,227 --> 00:41:08,670
Speaker 1: I take it.

663
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:09,443
Speaker 1: No, no No.

664
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:18,570
Speaker 0: But we eventually went to a toy store that said they were gonna have him in and my mom actually drove me to a toy Store like early in the morning when they opened as the shipment came in or whatever.

665
00:41:18,811 --> 00:41:20,885
Speaker 0: See the thing is and they didn't get any 50s.

666
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,577
Speaker 0: So I got the unthinkable.

667
00:41:23,677 --> 00:41:27,330
Speaker 0: I knew it existed but no one had one be crazy to have one.

668
00:41:27,691 --> 00:41:32,590
Speaker 0: No, no one's parents would actually buy them it but my mom bonded the hundred.

669
00:41:32,811 --> 00:41:36,930
Speaker 0: See I got the hundred and not the 50 because that's what the store got in that day.

670
00:41:37,191 --> 00:41:41,345
Speaker 1: See, I actually got the hundred almost immediately after getting the 50 and I always carried both.

671
00:41:41,827 --> 00:41:44,275
Speaker 0: Whoa You were rich and spoiled.

672
00:41:44,416 --> 00:41:44,677
Speaker 1: Yeah.

673
00:41:44,817 --> 00:41:46,563
Speaker 1: Yeah mostly due to credit card.

674
00:41:46,603 --> 00:41:50,750
Speaker 0: I was boiled with a hundred but goddamn Oh the hundred was so great.

675
00:41:50,851 --> 00:41:52,381
Speaker 0: No one we knew had the hundred but me.

676
00:41:52,401 --> 00:41:53,026
Speaker 0: it was crazy.

677
00:41:53,086 --> 00:41:57,610
Speaker 1: the hundred Unlike the 50 which had one little tank and you pumped it up and it put air in the tank.

678
00:41:57,771 --> 00:41:58,819
Speaker 0: It had the special bulb.

679
00:41:59,121 --> 00:42:00,310
Speaker 1: Yes, it had the bulb.

680
00:42:00,691 --> 00:42:11,470
Speaker 1: So what you did is you had a tank and when you pumped it it forced water into this other Tank and it pressurized it there and that is where the water came out when you shot.

681
00:42:11,952 --> 00:42:22,950
Speaker 1: Now the key advantage of this other than of course a lot more power a lot more water Was that you could take the tank off the front and you could still shoot the water that was in the reserve.

682
00:42:23,232 --> 00:42:26,309
Speaker 1: So you could defend yourself while refilling no matter what your source was.

683
00:42:26,659 --> 00:42:30,970
Speaker 0: Yes The other thing is the bulb in the back that held the pressurized water.

684
00:42:31,211 --> 00:42:34,764
Speaker 0: See the super soaker 50 pressurizes the water in there in the tank.

685
00:42:34,805 --> 00:42:36,130
Speaker 0: That is also the supply tank.

686
00:42:36,652 --> 00:42:41,128
Speaker 0: so if you take that thing off you lose all your pressure and you have to refill and everything.

687
00:42:41,429 --> 00:42:45,650
Speaker 0: when you Pressurized in a separate tank that's never going to be removed from your gun.

688
00:42:46,132 --> 00:42:54,964
Speaker 0: that tank is made out of much stronger plastic than the refill tank is made out of and You could get a lot more pressure into that little thing than you could.

689
00:42:55,366 --> 00:43:03,796
Speaker 0: you could imagine also You could pump it so much that there would be no air left in there and it would just be water Solid wall.

690
00:43:03,816 --> 00:43:05,162
Speaker 1: there was actually air in there.

691
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:10,870
Speaker 0: Otherwise, yes work because water is not compressible I know but it would be under such incredible pressure.

692
00:43:11,472 --> 00:43:17,030
Speaker 1: I mean I realized when I'd shoot it and it came out with such force that it didn't come out in a straight line anymore.

693
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:18,579
Speaker 1: It kind of spattered at the end.

694
00:43:18,961 --> 00:43:19,323
Speaker 0: Really?

695
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:20,630
Speaker 0: Hey, I didn't have that problem.

696
00:43:20,791 --> 00:43:21,193
Speaker 1: Well, it wasn't.

697
00:43:21,213 --> 00:43:27,338
Speaker 1: it was more that I'd pump it until the release valve was hissing inside of it And I'd keep pumping while I shot.

698
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:30,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like they say in the instructions like pump it X times.

699
00:43:30,751 --> 00:43:33,530
Speaker 0: No, no, no, you pump it until you can't physically pump it anymore.

700
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:36,081
Speaker 0: Yeah, you just keep pushing it harder and harder.

701
00:43:36,101 --> 00:43:36,985
Speaker 0: He couldn't break it there.

702
00:43:37,326 --> 00:43:39,699
Speaker 1: if it hit a certain pressure It would just start leaking internally.

703
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:40,101
Speaker 0: Yep.

704
00:43:40,323 --> 00:43:47,590
Speaker 1: That was a safety mechanism So it wouldn't explode or hurt you or anything also see wouldn't break it immediately Because you know, otherwise every kid would just pump it until it broke.

705
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:52,544
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was one thing while super soakers did break and did require replacing with future models.

706
00:43:53,025 --> 00:43:54,710
Speaker 0: They didn't break quite that often.

707
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:58,210
Speaker 0: I mean the Uzi ones were incredibly unreliable compared to the super soakers.

708
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:01,552
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean the only super soaker that ever broke on me was my 50.

709
00:44:01,552 --> 00:44:05,189
Speaker 1: Started not working so well, and then it broke and I kept repairing it.

710
00:44:05,391 --> 00:44:07,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, my hundred lasted me several summers.

711
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:08,336
Speaker 0: I replaced it with like.

712
00:44:08,677 --> 00:44:13,524
Speaker 0: I replaced it with one of those ones that had two side-by-side tanks And that lasted me a few summers.

713
00:44:13,765 --> 00:44:14,510
Speaker 0: Oh, I never got that.

714
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:19,388
Speaker 1: I stopped at the hundred though a kid in my neighborhood got the 200 the day it came out.

715
00:44:19,568 --> 00:44:22,010
Speaker 0: Wow Yeah, I had like this one.

716
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:31,588
Speaker 0: I replaced the hundred with was like the XPS something something and had like two side-by-side Tanks and the jet of water it shot was like four times as thick and powerful as the one.

717
00:44:31,608 --> 00:44:32,190
Speaker 0: the hundred shot.

718
00:44:32,717 --> 00:44:45,410
Speaker 1: I don't know what it was but pretty much by the time all those super soakers started coming out was right about when I gave up on sport guns and Water fights all together and almost entirely into water balloons and nerf combined.

719
00:44:45,632 --> 00:44:47,629
Speaker 0: Yeah, see I that was the last one for me.

720
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:55,930
Speaker 0: But my brother went one step further and he got the one that was basically It was basically it looked like this giant laser rifles like the CPS something thousand.

721
00:44:56,050 --> 00:45:15,849
Speaker 0: It was ludicrous and you would pump it a whole lot and had this purple tank on the back and when you fired it it fired like an inch radius jet of water that was like six feet long like the jet of water that came out was six feet long and it would go far and If it hit you it was like getting hit with five water balloons.

722
00:45:16,292 --> 00:45:19,710
Speaker 0: But you could only shoot it about three times before you're out of water.

723
00:45:20,131 --> 00:45:21,115
Speaker 0: But it was pretty crazy.

724
00:45:21,496 --> 00:45:28,546
Speaker 1: now super soakers have continued to evolve and I used to think man These new super soakers aren't like the old ones their crab because they look really dumb.

725
00:45:28,586 --> 00:45:29,069
Speaker 1: a lot of them.

726
00:45:29,572 --> 00:45:31,610
Speaker 0: A lot of them look like they're made of shittier plastic.

727
00:45:31,932 --> 00:45:35,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, have lots of gimmicks on them that are just gonna break and aren't actually gonna help you out.

728
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:49,548
Speaker 1: However in terms of actual power, I'm gonna read a quote here From the new one of the new kinds these constant pressure systems Which actually have a rubber chamber that expands and exerts pressure on the water as you pump it.

729
00:45:49,808 --> 00:45:53,439
Speaker 1: Wow Yeah quotes in larger models.

730
00:45:53,739 --> 00:45:57,630
Speaker 1: The resulting blast is forceful enough that recoil can be felt.

731
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:16,624
Speaker 1: So Scott and I have seriously been considering buying just two of the best Normal-sized easy to deal with super say not the monster xxx xxx xl I vix now But probably the modern equivalent of the 50 or the hundred and just keep them around.

732
00:46:16,704 --> 00:46:29,789
Speaker 0: Well, I did buy one of those When I was a camp counselor after my freshman year of college That particular instance of being a camp counselor our cabin had like a huge water fight because you know Of course all these kids brought super soakers to camp and never used them.

733
00:46:30,311 --> 00:46:52,558
Speaker 0: so we had like people up on the roof of our cabin and all around our cabin making water balloons and water everywhere and None of us seem to think there was a problem and none of the people running the camp thought there was a problem but counselors Of the other cabins didn't like it because they thought we were being irresponsible or something Uh-huh, and they got upset that our cabin was having fun and theirs wasn't and they were also getting wet and we're like just don't Come near our cabins.

734
00:46:54,031 --> 00:47:04,330
Speaker 0: But yeah at that time I just went to the grocery store and bought the super soaker they had there which was like an XPS 100 something something it was pretty good for the standard cheap super soaker.

735
00:47:04,476 --> 00:47:05,654
Speaker 1: Yeah See it said.

736
00:47:05,674 --> 00:47:21,701
Speaker 1: but I think the reason I dropped out of all this stuff pretty much right after the hundred like at the end of the hundreds run was that by then I was becoming more competitive in my life and Me and all my friends realized that with nerf battles you can have an actual game where if you're hit you're out.

737
00:47:21,781 --> 00:47:26,866
Speaker 1: or if you hit you can't use that body part or Three hits and you're out or capture the flag.

738
00:47:26,906 --> 00:47:27,590
Speaker 1: if you're hitting you're out.

739
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:32,158
Speaker 1: You have to give up the flag or whatever and we played actual Games instead of just get each other.

740
00:47:32,198 --> 00:47:34,750
Speaker 0: and if paintball and airsoft did a bit around you would have played that instead.

741
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:36,998
Speaker 1: Well paintball was around and I wanted to play paintball.

742
00:47:37,038 --> 00:47:39,627
Speaker 1: It was just expensive and it's cheap now.

743
00:47:39,848 --> 00:47:40,510
Speaker 1: Yeah now it's cheap.

744
00:47:40,731 --> 00:47:45,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, actually we're really thinking about getting into paintball and airsoft in the near future.

745
00:47:45,973 --> 00:47:47,164
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll see how it goes.

746
00:47:47,184 --> 00:47:52,590
Speaker 1: in the very least We've already decided we're gonna buy a bunch of cheap airsoft guns and play some airsoft.

747
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:54,317
Speaker 0: Yes, I don't know if you really want to do that.

748
00:47:54,337 --> 00:47:58,875
Speaker 0: We already know I'm the laser tag god, so am I just Playing airsoft.

749
00:47:58,895 --> 00:48:03,210
Speaker 0: You're all gonna get hurt for you were the god of laser quest style laser tag.

750
00:48:03,451 --> 00:48:10,530
Speaker 1: However in the team based cues are I know that I won two tournaments that the biggest cues are in the world in Tennessee.

751
00:48:10,993 --> 00:48:20,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, mostly because you were just carried by your team Because usually I was the one who was taking people out invading the base blowing up the base and getting out.

752
00:48:20,792 --> 00:48:23,770
Speaker 1: Plus I was one of the few people who figured out how to use the grenade because they didn't tell you.

753
00:48:24,212 --> 00:48:26,746
Speaker 1: But I read the thing and it said how to use the grenade.

754
00:48:26,786 --> 00:48:29,669
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, we got to do a show on laser tag.

755
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:33,684
Speaker 1: So I guess that don't let us forget to do a show on laser tag.

756
00:48:33,704 --> 00:48:34,770
Speaker 0: You want to wrap this show up?

757
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:35,652
Speaker 1: I don't know.

758
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:40,533
Speaker 0: I guess the only other thing to say about super soakers is that there's a lot of people modding them for great Awesome.

759
00:48:41,238 --> 00:48:44,796
Speaker 0: I mean when I was a kid we used to think hey What else can we put in here besides water?

760
00:48:45,277 --> 00:48:47,083
Speaker 0: Well, we put in ammonia.

761
00:48:47,163 --> 00:48:47,725
Speaker 0: Haha.

762
00:48:47,905 --> 00:48:49,149
Speaker 0: No one ever actually did it.

763
00:48:49,531 --> 00:48:51,147
Speaker 0: Of course, you know everyone gives like what do we filled with P?

764
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:55,830
Speaker 1: Hey, oh remember those squirt that those they were the cheap crap squirt guns.

765
00:48:56,071 --> 00:48:59,322
Speaker 1: But they had the gimmick that they came with blue or red disappearing ink.

766
00:48:59,402 --> 00:49:00,145
Speaker 0: I remember those.

767
00:49:00,185 --> 00:49:01,590
Speaker 0: there was not a Nickelodeon toy.

768
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:02,294
Speaker 0: I think it was.

769
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:04,225
Speaker 0: I remember I remember seeing commercials on Nickelodeon.

770
00:49:04,285 --> 00:49:05,170
Speaker 1: It didn't really work.

771
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:08,370
Speaker 1: It either stained your clothes or it disappeared immediately.

772
00:49:08,551 --> 00:49:09,274
Speaker 0: It was no good.

773
00:49:09,475 --> 00:49:12,690
Speaker 0: one kid had one and no one cared because the super soaker was God.

774
00:49:13,112 --> 00:49:15,040
Speaker 0: Yeah came through a water fight with one of those people.

775
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:17,190
Speaker 0: just get pissed off at you and only attack you.

776
00:49:17,551 --> 00:49:20,322
Speaker 1: Well one kid thought of the great idea fill a super soaker with that.

777
00:49:20,343 --> 00:49:22,090
Speaker 1: then he realized how expensive that stuff was.

778
00:49:22,391 --> 00:49:26,905
Speaker 0: Well, it was just like any other, you know thing where they charge for refills the toy store.

779
00:49:27,026 --> 00:49:28,813
Speaker 0: It's overpriced and a ripoff Yep.

780
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:38,522
Speaker 0: Yeah, so yeah, I hope Everyone out there who where it's not warm enough yet to have water gun fights is now Really sad because it's not warm enough to have water gun fights.
