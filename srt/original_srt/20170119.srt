Speaker 1: I got some books I want to do anyway.

8
00:00:32,852 --> 00:00:37,510
Speaker 0: So Emily was just cleaning out some stuff in the kitchen and she found some old wasabi powders.

9
00:00:38,794 --> 00:00:40,862
Speaker 1: She was like when is this from guess?

10
00:00:40,922 --> 00:00:41,946
Speaker 1: and I'm like few years.

00:00:41,986 --> 00:00:46,270
Speaker 0: She's like beacon yeah Seven years old almost as old as podcast.

12
00:00:46,892 --> 00:00:53,113
Speaker 1: It's amazing cuz you know it was probably old ish even in beacon and it's one of the because I packed some kitchen stuff and like Brought it when we moved.

13
00:00:53,534 --> 00:00:55,019
Speaker 1: so I guess we brought.

14
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:02,323
Speaker 0: so I got home from magfest and I go over you know I'm sure and usually when I leave to go somewhere for more than two days.

15
00:01:02,343 --> 00:01:05,033
Speaker 0: I always clean the hell out everything Right.

16
00:01:05,214 --> 00:01:07,503
Speaker 1: so in the very least I do a quick check at the fridge of.

17
00:01:07,603 --> 00:01:10,313
Speaker 1: is there anything that'll be rotten by the time I Get back exactly?

18
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,276
Speaker 1: and is there?

19
00:01:11,557 --> 00:01:12,860
Speaker 1: is there anything in my garbage bag?

20
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:30,509
Speaker 0: so I go over and you know I got back from magfest And I go over to the corner get a banana Because I just bought some banana on the way home to put it right because I obviously got rid of all the banana And I noticed is like some goop heart sticky goop on the counter that was not there when I left.

21
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,040
Speaker 1: oh I get terrified when that happened.

22
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,664
Speaker 0: It's sort of in between the toaster in the fridge And it's sort of brownish like like what the hell is that?

23
00:01:38,704 --> 00:01:40,070
Speaker 1: what did you find another banana?

24
00:01:40,811 --> 00:01:41,315
Speaker 0: What the hell is it?

25
00:01:41,356 --> 00:01:42,870
Speaker 0: could it could have been banana juice?

26
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:43,676
Speaker 0: I've been potato.

27
00:01:43,757 --> 00:01:44,181
Speaker 0: it could have.

28
00:01:44,201 --> 00:01:45,130
Speaker 0: who knows what it could have been.

29
00:01:45,971 --> 00:01:46,955
Speaker 0: I'm like what the hell is that?

30
00:01:46,995 --> 00:01:49,042
Speaker 0: where did it come from to come inside the toaster?

31
00:01:49,504 --> 00:01:52,550
Speaker 0: was it like they come from inside the somehow the top of the fridge?

32
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:59,356
Speaker 0: So my god, I guess it came from the cabinet, but like the cabinet is full of dry goods How could it come from the cabinet?

33
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:02,669
Speaker 0: so I opened the cabinet, and then I realized what had happened.

34
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:02,709
Speaker 0: I?

35
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,175
Speaker 0: Don't know which can.

36
00:02:05,235 --> 00:02:10,211
Speaker 0: it was oh a can exploded Botulism.

37
00:02:10,793 --> 00:02:18,180
Speaker 0: I don't know what happened, but one of the cans of stuff was no bueno and I realized I've never had that happen in my entire life.

38
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:19,346
Speaker 0: I never seen that happen ever.

39
00:02:19,386 --> 00:02:20,130
Speaker 0: I didn't think it could happen.

40
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:26,129
Speaker 0: So I looked at the cans and like many of them were goopy, but none of them were like broken obviously right.

41
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,810
Speaker 0: yeah I think it might have been this black bean can because it was at the top.

42
00:02:30,111 --> 00:02:31,315
Speaker 1: How old were the black beans?

43
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:35,470
Speaker 0: all of these cans were probably beacon old?

44
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,022
Speaker 0: And I realized why the hell am I keeping any of these cans?

45
00:02:40,062 --> 00:02:42,030
Speaker 1: and clearly haven't used them in all this time.

46
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,058
Speaker 0: I haven't used these cans and all these years.

47
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:45,061
Speaker 0: I'm not going to use them.

48
00:02:45,101 --> 00:02:47,370
Speaker 0: their best buy dates are long fast gone.

49
00:02:47,814 --> 00:02:53,009
Speaker 0: they're probably still edible, but I Haven't used them, and I've never think to use them.

50
00:02:53,411 --> 00:02:55,403
Speaker 0: Why do I have at least perishable things?

51
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:56,650
Speaker 1: they hit this point of no return?

52
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,092
Speaker 1: We were like.

53
00:02:57,132 --> 00:02:57,857
Speaker 1: this is an edible.

54
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:58,422
Speaker 1: I know it.

55
00:02:58,522 --> 00:02:59,610
Speaker 1: I can feel safe throwing away.

56
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,030
Speaker 1: If you look at a can you're like it's still technically good.

57
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:06,705
Speaker 0: So I have to clean my cabinet, but I also reclaimed a bunch of cabinet space.

58
00:03:06,805 --> 00:03:08,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, so as a win-lose situation.

59
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:14,278
Speaker 1: So this is the geek nights book club.

60
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,490
Speaker 1: if you're not familiar you should go check out the other book club.

61
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,413
Speaker 1: But things but the.

62
00:03:17,473 --> 00:03:18,617
Speaker 0: it's about reading.

63
00:03:18,697 --> 00:03:28,748
Speaker 0: you should read books because you're an intelligent person and not one of those people who says I don't read which means you're a bad person I have no respect for cuz I have to say we've had friends who used to not read and you know what.

64
00:03:28,768 --> 00:03:31,518
Speaker 1: when they started Reading they got a lot smarter right?

65
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:36,229
Speaker 0: so if you don't read read, and if you do read You don't got to be told to read.

66
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:41,210
Speaker 0: But it's fun to read a book that other people also read like case in point and talk to them about it.

67
00:03:41,271 --> 00:03:42,010
Speaker 1: It's nothing books.

68
00:03:42,112 --> 00:03:46,481
Speaker 1: I like them a lot But the only reason they're so like weirdly dear to my.

69
00:03:46,662 --> 00:03:51,017
Speaker 0: if I couldn't make a joke about you know breaking horses Why would I read that book?

70
00:03:51,218 --> 00:03:52,143
Speaker 1: what do you see?

71
00:03:52,163 --> 00:03:54,348
Speaker 0: yeah if I was all alone They would just be horrified.

72
00:03:54,611 --> 00:04:05,841
Speaker 1: But it was because a bunch of our friends all read that book at the same time by accident And then another bunch of our friends all read the book at the same time thus Rekindling the purpose and then we kept these embers going.

73
00:04:06,223 --> 00:04:08,490
Speaker 1: there's something fun about consuming media altogether.

74
00:04:08,932 --> 00:04:13,648
Speaker 1: So you can have that like don't worry about spoilers like have a real conversation about a thing that you're all familiar with.

75
00:04:13,668 --> 00:04:18,723
Speaker 0: so we're Suggesting a book for you to read that you know is gonna be good And we read it together and has a fun time.

76
00:04:18,764 --> 00:04:25,846
Speaker 1: so we read Rebecca the novel that the famous Alfred Hitchcock movie is actually really closely based on.

77
00:04:25,947 --> 00:04:26,208
Speaker 0: right.

78
00:04:26,268 --> 00:04:34,762
Speaker 0: so I had you know I love me some Alfred Hitchcock movies and This is you know rear window is like my number one favorite movie.

79
00:04:34,802 --> 00:04:35,825
Speaker 1: We know so good.

80
00:04:35,905 --> 00:04:36,668
Speaker 0: It's the best movie.

81
00:04:36,688 --> 00:04:39,336
Speaker 0: There is and Rebecca was like the second.

82
00:04:39,457 --> 00:04:42,310
Speaker 0: it was not the second best movie there is but the second best Hitchcock movie.

83
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:50,954
Speaker 1: If you ask me yeah It's tough though because I like some of the like older weirder ones like that like the spy ones from his earlier career I mean, but they're not.

84
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:55,110
Speaker 1: yeah, I mean like they've got problems, but like the Lady Vanishes is pretty great.

85
00:04:55,191 --> 00:04:57,870
Speaker 0: It's a good movie, and I mean there's not a lot of bad ones or anyway.

86
00:04:58,891 --> 00:05:08,877
Speaker 0: So I did not know until recently that It was based on a book even though when you watch the movie the first thing it shows on the screen is based on the book by.

87
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:26,130
Speaker 0: I Did not know that and as soon as I found that out I said Oh, I guess that's my book club Vic and so it was Daphne du Maurier If nice French lady, so this is extra weird because I when Scott said this is gonna be the book.

88
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,730
Speaker 1: I wasn't sure if I had seen the movie Rebecca or not.

89
00:05:30,111 --> 00:05:41,220
Speaker 0: I have only seen it like two times in the past and it was long ago, and I rewatched it after reading the book and You know The memory of it is like now all tangled up.

90
00:05:41,461 --> 00:05:42,163
Speaker 1: Oh even worse.

91
00:05:42,203 --> 00:05:44,070
Speaker 1: so I wasn't sure if I'd seen the movie.

92
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,558
Speaker 1: I was pretty sure I'd seen it.

93
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:47,730
Speaker 0: I had a hundred percent definitely seen the movie.

94
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,983
Speaker 0: I was not wrong like oh like you were.

95
00:05:50,245 --> 00:05:51,070
Speaker 1: but here's the problem.

96
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:57,690
Speaker 1: I saw a lot of these movies when I was very very young because my mom was really into gothic horror.

97
00:05:57,831 --> 00:06:03,458
Speaker 0: Yeah, well the movie is made in what like 1940 something We were born in 1980.

98
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:11,485
Speaker 1: so my age was definitely single digits when I saw Rebecca And I conflated it with this other movie picture mommy dead.

99
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:12,830
Speaker 0: We're not even close.

100
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:20,948
Speaker 1: Actually There's a bunch of it hits a lot of the same notes to where you could see like aesthetically why they could be.

101
00:06:21,028 --> 00:06:23,163
Speaker 0: it's black and white and it's old.

102
00:06:23,243 --> 00:06:38,530
Speaker 1: yeah, but Reading Rebecca After I got about a third of the way through it like I suddenly like very vividly remember seeing a scene I'm reading in a movie, and I remembered all these sit like the scene where mrs.

103
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:43,230
Speaker 1: Danvers is trying to convince her to kill herself like I suddenly was like oh shit the skull-faced lady.

104
00:06:43,351 --> 00:06:44,320
Speaker 1: I remember this movie.

105
00:06:44,441 --> 00:06:45,309
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

106
00:06:46,077 --> 00:06:48,629
Speaker 1: So I remembered all these scenes But I couldn't quite link them together.

107
00:06:49,352 --> 00:06:53,264
Speaker 1: And then I sort of remembered the movie in the course of reading the book.

108
00:06:53,886 --> 00:06:55,250
Speaker 1: and then now I want to watch the movie again.

109
00:06:55,592 --> 00:06:56,601
Speaker 0: You didn't watch the movie again.

110
00:06:56,843 --> 00:06:57,570
Speaker 1: I didn't watch the movie again.

111
00:06:57,911 --> 00:07:04,630
Speaker 1: Oh, I did because I wanted to make sure that the book reading was as little polluted by the movie as possible.

112
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:05,605
Speaker 0: I just watched.

113
00:07:05,686 --> 00:07:05,950
Speaker 0: I'm gonna.

114
00:07:06,071 --> 00:07:09,789
Speaker 0: I'm gonna tell you all the things when we do this episode that are different in the movie.

115
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:14,069
Speaker 1: yep But last warning we're gonna spoil both of them, so I hope you've read the book.

116
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:15,510
Speaker 1: otherwise We're gonna assume that you read it.

117
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,320
Speaker 1: We're not gonna explain to you what the hell this book is about.

118
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:22,129
Speaker 0: well one other thing is that you know this People talk about like gothic romance like gothic.

119
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,528
Speaker 1: This is like the gothic horror fiction.

120
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:25,816
Speaker 0: It's like, but it's like.

121
00:07:25,836 --> 00:07:27,064
Speaker 0: I did it.

122
00:07:27,084 --> 00:07:32,085
Speaker 0: you know I'm not gonna lie I didn't really a hundred percent understand what that means.

123
00:07:32,105 --> 00:07:32,246
Speaker 0: like.

124
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:33,310
Speaker 0: what does it mean like gothic?

125
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:33,713
Speaker 0: It's like.

126
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:36,510
Speaker 0: this is nothing to do with goth kids You think about that kind of goth?

127
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,950
Speaker 1: Before not before I read the definition of gothic stories and like all this stuff.

128
00:07:41,392 --> 00:07:45,309
Speaker 1: Here's what I always imagine there's going to be a fancy masquerade of some kind.

129
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:46,272
Speaker 1: yeah There is.

130
00:07:46,513 --> 00:07:49,803
Speaker 1: there are dramatic moments where people are introduced and stuff happens.

131
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:54,744
Speaker 1: there are scenes and gardens around a manor house And it's spooky and it's night sometimes right.

132
00:07:54,764 --> 00:07:55,750
Speaker 0: so what it would it mean?

133
00:07:55,951 --> 00:08:00,665
Speaker 0: It's basically a collection of you know certain tropes that make something gothic.

134
00:08:00,686 --> 00:08:06,243
Speaker 0: so it's basically like vaporwave Spooky mansions right like you think about the movie Beauty and the Beast.

135
00:08:06,303 --> 00:08:08,088
Speaker 0: right don't go to the West Wing.

136
00:08:08,108 --> 00:08:08,389
Speaker 0: That's right.

137
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,690
Speaker 0: It's like that's where Rebecca's hanging out right exactly.

138
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,801
Speaker 0: It's like Beauty and the Beast is a gothic romance kind of thing.

139
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:22,510
Speaker 0: or like you know any kind of Edgar Allan Poe Action right where it's like oh, he's in the spooky house, and there's the Raven right and it's like whoo.

140
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:29,559
Speaker 0: So if it's also a tale of romance it usually includes You know medieval kind of theming.

141
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,770
Speaker 0: you know like hint even if the medieval stuff was way in the past.

142
00:08:33,251 --> 00:08:34,937
Speaker 0: Right you know that kind of stuff.

143
00:08:35,078 --> 00:08:36,924
Speaker 1: or like you know here's a more modern take.

144
00:08:36,943 --> 00:08:40,361
Speaker 1: so there's a. there's a sub-genre that I did Know about because again my mom was really into it.

145
00:08:40,764 --> 00:08:49,372
Speaker 0: southern gothic Which is basically set in the American South right instead of being in a European castle is in like you know a big old plantation House.

146
00:08:49,552 --> 00:08:51,319
Speaker 0: yeah, but it's the same kind of thing like.

147
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:56,744
Speaker 1: I think the best example of this is probably Midnight in the Garden of Good And Evil which is a fantastic I've heard of.

148
00:08:57,006 --> 00:08:59,577
Speaker 0: you never seen it Maybe but I don't remember.

149
00:08:59,677 --> 00:09:01,146
Speaker 0: it is also based on a book.

150
00:09:01,669 --> 00:09:02,454
Speaker 1: okay We could do.

151
00:09:02,494 --> 00:09:05,069
Speaker 1: this is the next book club to stick with a gothic theme for a while.

152
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:14,250
Speaker 1: But the movie it's your pick Men in the Garden of Good and Evil was the first movie I saw that featured Kevin Spacey where I was like god damn that guy's a good actor.

153
00:09:15,075 --> 00:09:16,090
Speaker 1: Like I just like that movie.

154
00:09:20,091 --> 00:09:20,352
Speaker 1: Later.

155
00:09:20,452 --> 00:09:22,639
Speaker 1: actually I think I saw this first fun fact.

156
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:25,950
Speaker 0: I saw the usual suspects for the first time in chemistry class.

157
00:09:27,394 --> 00:09:35,781
Speaker 1: Nothing better to do But it is a gothic tale, and it is like it is that to a T. It is like you know that vaporwave video.

158
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:37,110
Speaker 1: that is like yeah, that's vaporwave.

159
00:09:37,653 --> 00:09:40,270
Speaker 1: Look at this movie or this book and like yeah, that is a gothic romance.

160
00:09:41,573 --> 00:09:47,129
Speaker 1: So the only question I have for you the listener What is the main character's name?

161
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:54,486
Speaker 1: Because it is not said at any point in the novel or the movie.

162
00:09:54,526 --> 00:09:55,790
Speaker 0: no well it is it's mrs.

163
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,462
Speaker 1: Dewan's doing sir, but what was it before she got married?

164
00:09:58,945 --> 00:09:59,568
Speaker 1: It was just mrs.

165
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:11,824
Speaker 0: Miss something the girl who is hanging around the fat old kind of horrible lady Well, I mean almost the entire thing is is from her mrs.. Dewan's perspective.

166
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,308
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, so it's not.

167
00:10:13,388 --> 00:10:14,754
Speaker 0: it's it's me Right.

168
00:10:14,854 --> 00:10:16,784
Speaker 0: it's or her or you know I?

169
00:10:16,804 --> 00:10:22,007
Speaker 0: yeah, not her right It's I or me because it's from her point of view almost everything that happens.

170
00:10:22,107 --> 00:10:24,119
Speaker 1: much very Stark and made.

171
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,730
Speaker 1: I think that is one of the big tone differences.

172
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,680
Speaker 0: So you know like you don't say your name right if I'm telling a story.

173
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,085
Speaker 0: I'm never like oh Scott.

174
00:10:30,145 --> 00:10:31,470
Speaker 0: Did this yep, right?

175
00:10:31,751 --> 00:10:38,969
Speaker 0: I'm only gonna say my name if I have to narrate the dialogue of somebody talking to me and that person is gonna say mr.

176
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:39,781
Speaker 0: Ruben.

177
00:10:39,884 --> 00:10:47,258
Speaker 1: well We also know it was intentional because I'm because the author apparently had to continuously respond to Fan letters saying why did you do this?

178
00:10:47,739 --> 00:11:11,410
Speaker 1: and she would always say that she thought it was an interesting technical device And it was very much intentional and it served a purpose Independent of it kind of making sense looking at the book being from the perspective of mrs.. Dewan sir mm-hmm I really like the book, but I was I guess Startled by the difference when you find out in the middle that he just fucking shot Rebecca.

179
00:11:11,792 --> 00:11:12,635
Speaker 1: Yeah, like that.

180
00:11:12,936 --> 00:11:14,684
Speaker 1: then literally I was reading the book and I was like all right.

181
00:11:14,704 --> 00:11:15,808
Speaker 1: kind of remember this kind of remember this.

182
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:20,581
Speaker 1: and then He's tells his wife like oh, yeah I killed her and I literally stopped reading like wait what?

183
00:11:21,123 --> 00:11:22,770
Speaker 0: no you didn't know that was happening.

184
00:11:23,011 --> 00:11:25,203
Speaker 1: I didn't know that he murdered her.

185
00:11:25,223 --> 00:11:33,121
Speaker 1: It's an Alfred Hitchcock Thing Memory from the movie of her like falling down the stairs or something now.

186
00:11:33,182 --> 00:11:35,829
Speaker 0: so in the movie actually right because that's the thing right.

187
00:11:35,849 --> 00:11:45,893
Speaker 0: so You sort of have this dual situation going on where you know the story is being told from the perspective of Mrs.. Dewan sir.

188
00:11:46,274 --> 00:11:49,965
Speaker 0: right and you're sort of on her side like she's the good person.

189
00:11:50,487 --> 00:11:51,390
Speaker 0: and you know mrs.

190
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:55,590
Speaker 0: Danvers and Rebecca they're evil from the the dark right.

191
00:11:55,691 --> 00:11:57,483
Speaker 0: it's like they're the ones who are bad.

192
00:11:57,503 --> 00:12:04,850
Speaker 0: right and Mr.. Dewan sir is like he's sort of mysterious, but he's you know he's still good right?

193
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:14,949
Speaker 0: it's just you know he's not enough information coming out of him to get the whole story, which is what makes the story work and You sort of her on the side of you know mr.

194
00:12:15,351 --> 00:12:18,727
Speaker 0: And mrs.. Dewan sir and against Danvers and Rebecca.

195
00:12:18,747 --> 00:12:19,470
Speaker 0: yes, right.

196
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:23,430
Speaker 0: And then it's like oh, no actually we shot Rebecca.

197
00:12:24,214 --> 00:12:34,122
Speaker 0: And if you read the book Based on who you are as a human being in the real world if you're me suddenly you're like oh Well, I mean mrs.. Danvers is a little creepy.

198
00:12:34,162 --> 00:12:35,650
Speaker 0: Rebecca was totally fucking awesome.

199
00:12:35,952 --> 00:12:38,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got your piece of shit who murdered her.

200
00:12:38,611 --> 00:12:40,323
Speaker 0: But then it was like I would like to.

201
00:12:40,404 --> 00:12:41,310
Speaker 0: and now you're evil.

202
00:12:41,471 --> 00:12:45,287
Speaker 1: But at the same time it also sort of twists in that I mean you don't that the thing is.

203
00:12:45,327 --> 00:12:51,205
Speaker 1: a big theme of this Book is that you don't know what other people remember have experienced have been through.

204
00:12:51,225 --> 00:12:54,717
Speaker 1: you don't actually know their perspective If you only know by communicating with them.

205
00:12:54,798 --> 00:12:57,710
Speaker 0: right well because your first half of the book because it's for the perspective of mrs.

206
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:06,350
Speaker 0: Dewan sir And she doesn't ask about anything that happened before so she's just filled with like her Assumptions about the past of like this world that she's entered.

207
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:17,905
Speaker 1: But not just that she's filled by like her perceptions of everything like your half the first the entire first half of the book is her Sort of fantasizing about what might be happening, and she's sort of like.

208
00:13:17,925 --> 00:13:19,610
Speaker 0: she doesn't know anything.

209
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,961
Speaker 0: And it's also she's guessing and she's guessing assuming the worst.

210
00:13:23,061 --> 00:13:24,225
Speaker 1: yeah, she always seems the worst.

211
00:13:24,265 --> 00:13:27,474
Speaker 1: It's very like depressive Ideation of like.

212
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:28,478
Speaker 1: oh well they must hate me.

213
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,060
Speaker 1: everyone thinks.

214
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,370
Speaker 1: I'm horrible everything I must be so bad.

215
00:13:31,631 --> 00:13:34,505
Speaker 0: It's a good read because I know people in the real world who think that way.

216
00:13:34,525 --> 00:13:35,510
Speaker 0: it's a very common sentiment.

217
00:13:35,631 --> 00:13:39,390
Speaker 0: But and even people in the real don't think that way all the time think that way some of the time, right?

218
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,650
Speaker 0: It's like you don't know if someone likes you or not.

219
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,818
Speaker 0: So you think they must hate you, but then the big reveal.

220
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:49,094
Speaker 1: one of the big reveals now even more so I think than the murder is When mrs.

221
00:13:49,134 --> 00:13:55,050
Speaker 1: De winter reveals to her husband that she thinks he doesn't love her and that he's still in love with Rebecca.

222
00:13:55,131 --> 00:13:57,810
Speaker 0: Why didn't you have the balls to say anything about that earlier?

223
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:03,609
Speaker 1: But then he turns around and reveals that he assumed completely different things about her like his.

224
00:14:04,171 --> 00:14:09,190
Speaker 1: Imagining about her motivations and her desires and her happiness was also a hundred percent off.

225
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:14,210
Speaker 1: He was looking at her actions from his assumptions and making this really wrong conclusion.

226
00:14:14,593 --> 00:14:17,090
Speaker 1: She was looking at his actions from her assumptions making this really wrong.

227
00:14:17,511 --> 00:14:22,570
Speaker 1: They were both like a hundred and eighty degrees away from the reality of each other's situation.

228
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:30,602
Speaker 0: Now usually this is one of those cases where it's like if only you would have just said something Everything and it's like one of the usually when that happens in a story.

229
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:31,846
Speaker 1: It's like a bad story.

230
00:14:31,967 --> 00:14:32,850
Speaker 0: It's it's just bad.

231
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:37,010
Speaker 0: It's like oh if only you had just talked you could have sorted this out from the beginning, right?

232
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:42,461
Speaker 0: It's like he would have been happy to tell you he wouldn't have told you he murdered her But he would have told you that he didn't like Rebecca.

233
00:14:42,702 --> 00:14:44,370
Speaker 0: but he assumed you're on the start.

234
00:14:44,591 --> 00:14:48,706
Speaker 1: He assumed you were aloof and unhappy and he thought like he thought you heard like he was like.

235
00:14:48,727 --> 00:14:56,407
Speaker 0: well this marriage doesn't go Right, but you could have discussed that when you're still in Monte Carlo and you would have at least known He hated Rebecca and not been all insecure her all this time.

236
00:14:56,468 --> 00:14:59,335
Speaker 0: However There's a really good reason.

237
00:14:59,355 --> 00:15:04,709
Speaker 0: they didn't say any of these things to begin with and that's because they have this plot device of.

238
00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:09,973
Speaker 0: she Thinks perhaps correctly, so he doesn't want to hear about Right.

239
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:11,984
Speaker 0: You want to talk to someone about their dead spouse?

240
00:15:12,024 --> 00:15:13,110
Speaker 0: That's really uncomfortable.

241
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,412
Speaker 0: Yeah, right You don't like.

242
00:15:14,432 --> 00:15:17,767
Speaker 1: you want to bring that up like one of the most tense scenes in them in the book.

243
00:15:17,928 --> 00:15:18,390
Speaker 1: is when?

244
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:22,150
Speaker 1: She chases the dog off to that like Marina house in the cove.

245
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:23,774
Speaker 1: Yeah Cuz the whole like.

246
00:15:23,794 --> 00:15:24,717
Speaker 1: the whole description is.

247
00:15:24,777 --> 00:15:28,670
Speaker 1: he is like I don't want to go over there and he's obviously like really freaking out.

248
00:15:29,013 --> 00:15:32,353
Speaker 0: It's he doesn't want to be reminded of Rebecca.

249
00:15:32,414 --> 00:15:35,790
Speaker 0: so from your perspective knowing that you know, this guy's wife died.

250
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,670
Speaker 0: It's like you're trying to avoid that topic as much as possible.

251
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:43,323
Speaker 0: But you're also need to know what happened in the past to lose your insecurity.

252
00:15:43,383 --> 00:15:48,809
Speaker 1: that scene is tense because you the reader pick up on the fact that max is really uncomfortable.

253
00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:52,870
Speaker 0: and Well, I mean, but it's understandable his wife died there.

254
00:15:52,972 --> 00:16:00,073
Speaker 1: Well, mrs De Winter who doesn't have the same knowledge that we have as the reader like we can see a lot more because we're sort of this Perspective.

255
00:16:00,796 --> 00:16:04,570
Speaker 1: she sort of is putting that all of her head and is focused on just like chase after the dog.

256
00:16:04,994 --> 00:16:06,229
Speaker 1: She's not thinking about it.

257
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:19,190
Speaker 1: So you see her going headlong into this and meanwhile all the descriptions around it are just setting this really ominous tone To where you're almost afraid about what she's gonna find in there Like you have expect to find a body in there in that early scene.

258
00:16:19,431 --> 00:16:30,330
Speaker 0: Well, there's also a creepy guy right the creepy guy down by the beach Yeah, who basically to me, you know, he's not as significant a character, but he feels a lot like Boo Radley.

259
00:16:31,493 --> 00:16:45,469
Speaker 1: Right, it's always like that weird mysterious guy who knows up something, you know the things he'd say right, but he was interesting because When you first meet him, she has this perception of him in a certain way.

260
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:46,854
Speaker 1: but was it Frank?

261
00:16:46,934 --> 00:16:53,758
Speaker 1: someone says and during the book that he's not nearly as in like Incapacitated as he lets on incompetent.

262
00:16:53,838 --> 00:17:05,369
Speaker 1: Yeah, like he he is way more together than he is acting Yes, and different people have different perceptions of his capabilities Which again is like that's the driving theme of this book is you can't know you only know what people say.

263
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:14,229
Speaker 1: So when max tells the story of how and why he murdered Rebecca It's a weird situation where like yes, you shouldn't have murdered her.

264
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:21,429
Speaker 1: But you also understand sort of if everything he said was true why he would have because he's a piece of shit.

265
00:17:21,931 --> 00:17:26,230
Speaker 1: Ah, but this so think about a play devil's advocate from the perspective of society at that time.

266
00:17:26,731 --> 00:17:35,250
Speaker 1: She basically threatened to cuckold him or ruin his life did well well Did she didn't actually have a child?

267
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,192
Speaker 0: I guess not.

268
00:17:36,874 --> 00:17:42,592
Speaker 1: and the fur the final revelation at the end like knowing at the end that she just had cancer and couldn't have Had a child.

269
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:43,235
Speaker 0: Mmm.

270
00:17:43,637 --> 00:17:46,709
Speaker 1: It is implied that she was trying to get him to kill her.

271
00:17:47,331 --> 00:17:51,244
Speaker 1: Mmm that that was suicide by max sure but at the same.

272
00:17:51,344 --> 00:17:53,050
Speaker 1: but but he she was basically threatening.

273
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,318
Speaker 0: Right, but there's this whole right.

274
00:17:57,131 --> 00:18:01,285
Speaker 0: The book tries to convince you that like Rebecca was somehow a bad person.

275
00:18:01,325 --> 00:18:04,595
Speaker 0: But actually she was just a fucking Incredible person right?

276
00:18:04,635 --> 00:18:06,059
Speaker 0: It's like she was partying.

277
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,283
Speaker 0: She was getting it on.

278
00:18:07,303 --> 00:18:09,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, she could run that mansion like nobody's business.

279
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:10,833
Speaker 0: Oh, she's only.

280
00:18:11,114 --> 00:18:12,920
Speaker 1: she knew she could decorate way.

281
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:13,422
Speaker 0: Awesome.

282
00:18:13,482 --> 00:18:15,710
Speaker 0: It's like she was just like this awesome incredible person.

283
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,914
Speaker 0: You're like everyone loved.

284
00:18:17,376 --> 00:18:18,118
Speaker 0: it's like so.

285
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:23,258
Speaker 1: did the conversation that him and Rebecca had and Monte Carlo Take place the way max remembers it?

286
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:31,430
Speaker 1: did she at the beginning of their marriage say listen I fucked you and now I own this shit and I'll blackmail you so you got to play along or I'll ruin everything?

287
00:18:31,932 --> 00:18:34,423
Speaker 1: Well, you know that happened as said or is this again?

288
00:18:34,483 --> 00:18:35,909
Speaker 1: Is this all max?

289
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,861
Speaker 1: reading into things and being jealous or is it max?

290
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:49,770
Speaker 1: because he obviously lives in this world of High society at that time in place where Rebecca's actions in that perspective are seen as abhorrent and unforgivable?

291
00:18:50,031 --> 00:18:59,858
Speaker 1: Cuz they're too managed even though in a modern sense Rebecca would be seen in a much more modern and positive light Unless she was literally blackmailing him.

292
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:04,230
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you don't really know it's a very, you know, it's a sexist kind of issue, right?

293
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,961
Speaker 1: You know, it's like but it's complicated on the fact that we don't need.

294
00:19:07,182 --> 00:19:12,738
Speaker 0: the name of the mansion is Manderley and that's not an accident right?

295
00:19:13,099 --> 00:19:13,259
Speaker 0: is?

296
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:13,540
Speaker 0: you know?

297
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,245
Speaker 0: Manderley is the land of men.

298
00:19:15,746 --> 00:19:27,100
Speaker 0: Well, it's a patriarchy like it's a Ancestral home and Rebecca was max and Rebecca was running that shit and she wasn't no man Right, and that's how Max couldn't stand for that.

299
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:33,405
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time she may have been running it under Very dubious pretenses.

300
00:19:33,767 --> 00:19:40,493
Speaker 1: Hmm But again, we can't know because we only have one perspective and that is mrs De winters.

301
00:19:40,795 --> 00:19:43,370
Speaker 1: max's perspective is his telling of what happened.

302
00:19:44,012 --> 00:19:45,117
Speaker 0: You can go by mrs.

303
00:19:45,157 --> 00:19:47,908
Speaker 0: Danvers story of what Rebecca is like, right?

304
00:19:47,928 --> 00:19:48,430
Speaker 0: She's awesome.

305
00:19:48,631 --> 00:19:57,169
Speaker 0: So in the novel you definitely understand versus fitting is mrs Danvers, even though like she may be right in that Rebecca was way awesome, right?

306
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:01,121
Speaker 0: Miss Dan, it doesn't help your perspective because mrs.

307
00:20:01,141 --> 00:20:04,130
Speaker 0: Danvers herself even is obsessive and insane, right?

308
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:07,804
Speaker 0: She's like the lady in perfect blue spoilers.

309
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:10,919
Speaker 0: Yep, right It's like all these characters.

310
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,010
Speaker 0: obviously these characters were here first, right?

311
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:13,532
Speaker 0: You could.

312
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:14,997
Speaker 0: it's the other way around right?

313
00:20:15,037 --> 00:20:18,350
Speaker 0: It's like keep saying like Oh to kill a mockingbird came way after this.

314
00:20:21,074 --> 00:20:21,865
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it did.

315
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:23,762
Speaker 1: This is published in 1938, right?

316
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:33,851
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure to kill a mockingbird is a newer book and I'm a hundred percent sure perfect blue is newer 1960s.

317
00:20:33,892 --> 00:20:34,634
Speaker 1: the yeah, right.

318
00:20:34,674 --> 00:20:36,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, so there you go.

319
00:20:36,821 --> 00:20:38,908
Speaker 1: Yep, but so mrs.

320
00:20:38,948 --> 00:20:41,614
Speaker 1: Danvers Based on the book.

321
00:20:42,456 --> 00:20:47,591
Speaker 1: I am convinced that Rebecca was bisexual and straight-up seduced Mrs.

322
00:20:47,632 --> 00:20:52,230
Speaker 1: Danvers at some point probably to draw her into this sort of sapphic fascination.

323
00:20:53,532 --> 00:20:54,576
Speaker 1: So she basically made mrs.

324
00:20:54,616 --> 00:20:55,239
Speaker 1: Danvers her.

325
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:57,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, Rebecca was also super good at sailing.

326
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,434
Speaker 0: Yeah, all kinds of others.

327
00:20:59,715 --> 00:21:00,377
Speaker 1: She basically had mrs.

328
00:21:00,417 --> 00:21:05,110
Speaker 1: Danvers wrapped around her finger like she like she had her she was a thrall.

329
00:21:05,374 --> 00:21:08,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean mrs Danvers like took care of her since she was like small right.

330
00:21:08,939 --> 00:21:21,218
Speaker 1: so according to some of the liner notes in this book for this Book in the movie that had to be toned down because one of the rules of I guess the brain Commission is you weren't allowed to show lesbian Romance in cinema.

331
00:21:21,459 --> 00:21:21,619
Speaker 0: Yeah.

332
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,162
Speaker 0: No stop.

333
00:21:22,202 --> 00:21:22,724
Speaker 0: So a lot of.

334
00:21:22,764 --> 00:21:22,884
Speaker 0: so.

335
00:21:22,905 --> 00:21:27,724
Speaker 0: the movie is like Surprisingly close to the book while also key.

336
00:21:28,326 --> 00:21:29,350
Speaker 0: things are different, right?

337
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,339
Speaker 1: He didn't technically murder her because you're not.

338
00:21:31,379 --> 00:21:33,489
Speaker 1: you weren't allowed to show his spouse murdering another spouse.

339
00:21:33,972 --> 00:21:41,770
Speaker 0: I don't know if that was about being allowed But it was more like look if we show if that's the story in the book in the movie, right?

340
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,209
Speaker 0: Nobody's gonna go for that.

341
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:46,009
Speaker 1: There appears to have been a censorship rule.

342
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:49,730
Speaker 1: It's where you weren't allowed that the liner said something that the fact that it's possible.

343
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:53,365
Speaker 0: But also it's just like you couldn't if you put that in a movie, right?

344
00:21:53,466 --> 00:21:54,410
Speaker 0: Nobody would go for that.

345
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,736
Speaker 0: They'd be like, whoa, what?

346
00:21:55,817 --> 00:21:57,887
Speaker 0: No, they would turn on right?

347
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:06,850
Speaker 0: It's like you can't have the main character suddenly become the bad guy Like people would be hating the movie and throwing tomatoes at the screen or whatever right, you know, so yeah though again.

348
00:22:06,991 --> 00:22:11,160
Speaker 1: So it's interesting to look at also To kill a mockingbird again.

349
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:16,326
Speaker 0: The thing ends with like court scenes In court with judges and shit, right?

350
00:22:16,386 --> 00:22:24,230
Speaker 0: It's like come on Yep So the plate the movie the both of the movies actually those scenes are very similar in the way they play out.

351
00:22:24,631 --> 00:22:35,150
Speaker 1: So an interesting aspect of that moment too of when he reveals to mrs De Winter that he murdered Rebecca is that from that point forward like the whole time?

352
00:22:35,992 --> 00:22:44,530
Speaker 1: our main character is unsure of herself and Basically never takes decisive action on anything and second guess is literally everything.

353
00:22:45,273 --> 00:22:48,406
Speaker 1: And then from that moment on she's just like all right.

354
00:22:48,426 --> 00:22:50,319
Speaker 1: Well, let's cover the shit up Let's go like do this.

355
00:22:50,379 --> 00:22:55,985
Speaker 1: and this is like she starts Consoling him and giving him the stone-cold advice of a professional.

356
00:22:56,266 --> 00:22:57,290
Speaker 1: to go back to master Keaton.

357
00:22:57,712 --> 00:23:01,590
Speaker 1: This book has that theme again be like the master versus the professional.

358
00:23:02,232 --> 00:23:09,050
Speaker 1: So like she was a normal human being she was young and naive But that's also what made her interesting.

359
00:23:09,612 --> 00:23:17,830
Speaker 1: But she didn't realize that and even max notices that as soon as she started acting the way she you know Quote should have acted from his perspective.

360
00:23:18,572 --> 00:23:20,838
Speaker 1: Suddenly he's like wow, you've changed your old now.

361
00:23:20,878 --> 00:23:24,869
Speaker 0: Well, cuz suddenly your eyes suddenly Rebecca's ghost wasn't haunting her anymore, right?

362
00:23:26,013 --> 00:23:28,881
Speaker 1: But then to to to kill Rebecca's memory.

363
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:31,830
Speaker 1: she basically had to become to some degree Rebecca.

364
00:23:32,294 --> 00:23:34,450
Speaker 1: She had to fall into in the movie.

365
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:48,793
Speaker 0: it's even more that there's a scene in the movie that I don't think is in the I don't remember being in the book where she goes into the morning room right and there's all like Rebecca's stationery with the letter R on it on the table and He tells mrs.

366
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:56,151
Speaker 0: Danvers like throw all this shit out and she's like, oh, but these are you know, you know Mrs.

367
00:23:56,171 --> 00:23:59,692
Speaker 0: Dewinter's things and she's like, I'm mrs Dewinter.

368
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:04,990
Speaker 1: now she has a dream where she basically does that at the very end of the novel in the car ride back, right?

369
00:24:05,251 --> 00:24:18,610
Speaker 0: No, but in the in the movie That's a scene where she's like, yeah miss Danvers making you throw Rebecca shit out But she like looks in the mirror and it's like sort of sees Rebecca there because she you don't know what Rebecca looks like.

370
00:24:19,437 --> 00:24:22,014
Speaker 0: You get descriptions of it You don't know.

371
00:24:22,114 --> 00:24:28,090
Speaker 1: but she on one hand is afraid of Rebecca because she needs she needs to replace Rebecca or she won't feel comfortable.

372
00:24:28,571 --> 00:24:38,852
Speaker 1: but at the same time she's kind of envious of Rebecca because Rebecca seemed to be this very strong perfect figure and She's not living up to any of that Like she wishes.

373
00:24:39,093 --> 00:24:44,290
Speaker 1: she was a sailor and a horseback rider and a hunter and ran these fancy balls, right?

374
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,559
Speaker 0: But look, but look it's like that's.

375
00:24:45,639 --> 00:24:50,710
Speaker 0: you know, Max, you know He was married to the awesome person and he didn't like that.

376
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:54,690
Speaker 0: He wanted the you know, the woman who wasn't capable, right?

377
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:55,232
Speaker 0: You know.

378
00:24:55,473 --> 00:24:58,428
Speaker 1: so he could be the man at the same time sort of resentful.

379
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:03,369
Speaker 0: He didn't want the adult woman and he's like, ah shit I got the adult woman again.

380
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:06,059
Speaker 1: But he was also sort of resentful of the new mrs.

381
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:09,330
Speaker 1: Winter because she seemed very unhappy and unsure of herself all the time.

382
00:25:09,571 --> 00:25:12,650
Speaker 0: He wanted someone who was happy and light-hearted and you know.

383
00:25:13,356 --> 00:25:22,021
Speaker 1: But he also wanted a professional Someone who could like like during the ball the ball incident where she comes down wearing the dress because mrs Danvers totally fucking set her up.

384
00:25:22,101 --> 00:25:28,217
Speaker 1: Yeah, like brilliantly And you see it coming the whole time and then she walks downstairs everyone freaks out like.

385
00:25:28,237 --> 00:25:43,089
Speaker 1: that's what my favorite scenes in the book, but He being a professional just like puts on a face and does the dinner party like no sweat Mm-hmm, and she hides in a room and even Beatrice is like listen You got a fucking hardened up and come down here and do this thing.

386
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:50,676
Speaker 1: yeah, like just just put on the fucking dress and come down and play your part and we'll deal with this tomorrow because that's what Professionals do.

387
00:25:51,058 --> 00:25:52,649
Speaker 1: but she wasn't capable of doing that.

388
00:25:52,991 --> 00:26:00,844
Speaker 1: So max was obviously kind of angry at her for not being capable of doing that Despite the fact that to be capable of doing that she would have had to be more like Rebecca.

389
00:26:00,864 --> 00:26:04,330
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm He wasn't that mad though, right?

390
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:05,312
Speaker 0: Most of it was.

391
00:26:05,332 --> 00:26:08,285
Speaker 0: she just thought he was mad at her but he actually wasn't like.

392
00:26:08,306 --> 00:26:10,817
Speaker 0: the next time they're together He was mad.

393
00:26:11,018 --> 00:26:13,410
Speaker 0: But again, he's mad for a short time and he gets over well.

394
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,703
Speaker 1: He was also mad for a very different reason.

395
00:26:16,025 --> 00:26:21,345
Speaker 0: Yeah Hmm, that's another reminds me of another small difference.

396
00:26:21,385 --> 00:26:25,186
Speaker 0: It's not really meaningful Yeah, but in the book at the costume party, right?

397
00:26:26,611 --> 00:26:28,760
Speaker 0: What's the name of the the sister?

398
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,370
Speaker 0: again Beatrice Beatrice and her husband, right?

399
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:32,372
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like.

400
00:26:32,452 --> 00:26:33,476
Speaker 1: Beatrice seems awesome.

401
00:26:33,517 --> 00:26:34,280
Speaker 1: She is awesome.

402
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:34,721
Speaker 1: Derpy.

403
00:26:35,143 --> 00:26:35,745
Speaker 0: He is derpy.

404
00:26:35,906 --> 00:26:36,950
Speaker 1: It's like awesome and derpy.

405
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:50,310
Speaker 0: Yes, that is correct, but in both in the book and I'll be but in the book their costumes are like racially insensitive Yep, and in the movie they are different costumes Which is nice because this movie was made at a time when you could be racially insensitive and no one would give a shit.

406
00:26:50,491 --> 00:26:52,301
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think in the in the book.

407
00:26:52,341 --> 00:26:59,549
Speaker 0: He's like an Arab guy Which is not good with like, you know with paint on his face is I guess it's you know, not blackface.

408
00:26:59,569 --> 00:27:03,942
Speaker 1: good But you know, you sort of you might argue that that was the even.

409
00:27:04,343 --> 00:27:15,087
Speaker 1: the author may have been portraying the Accurate racist sensibilities of the upper class at the time on purpose maybe but in the movie he's a caveman and he's got or like a.

410
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:22,437
Speaker 0: He's wearing like a leopard print sort of like one shoulder Fred Flintstone kind of thing Yeah, and he's got a barbell with.

411
00:27:22,497 --> 00:27:25,830
Speaker 0: he's like good and good and it's on both ends of the barbell.

412
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:28,489
Speaker 0: It's inflated and as a joke really bounces it off the ground.

413
00:27:30,572 --> 00:27:31,675
Speaker 0: But he's derpy right.

414
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:38,134
Speaker 0: and yeah Beatrice but this you know as awesome as Beatrice is right the movie is very condensed.

415
00:27:38,495 --> 00:27:48,907
Speaker 0: so you lose a lot of those things like, you know times just hanging out with Beatrice or Going to visit the you know, the old lady grandma screaming Rebecca Rebecca Rebecca.

416
00:27:48,947 --> 00:27:50,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's not in there.

417
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:54,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know like a lot of those things are cut out right to save the time.

418
00:27:54,391 --> 00:27:58,963
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the court scenes I think were super well-written like they were coursing intense.

419
00:27:59,064 --> 00:28:01,390
Speaker 0: I mean court scenes are always the highest drama.

420
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,438
Speaker 0: That's why it's so.

421
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:04,110
Speaker 0: that's why it's so easy to make law and order.

422
00:28:05,872 --> 00:28:08,630
Speaker 0: This drama is gonna be so easy man, I could write this in my eyes closed.

423
00:28:08,758 --> 00:28:14,730
Speaker 0: Yeah I can write 10,000 episodes my eyes closed because court is the most dramatic place on earth before the boat guy is.

424
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:27,148
Speaker 1: But there's something that's weirding me out and I just want to tell you and then the prosecutor like the boat expert Yeah, and then the prosecutor raises eyebrow like yes, and then max is like, oh fuck me.

425
00:28:27,168 --> 00:28:27,449
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

426
00:28:28,012 --> 00:28:35,390
Speaker 1: And especially because at that point like mrs Nose and she knows the full details so she starts freaking out and then faints, right?

427
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:46,110
Speaker 0: I just actually really like how Even though I kind of want I want him to lose and be found out and go to jail I also want him to win because the person who's going after him is the biggest piece of shit on earth, right?

428
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:46,452
Speaker 0: It's like.

429
00:28:46,492 --> 00:28:47,094
Speaker 0: it's so weird.

430
00:28:47,115 --> 00:28:49,325
Speaker 0: It's like this guy Rebecca's cousin is like.

431
00:28:49,345 --> 00:28:52,743
Speaker 0: it's a big piece of shit Yeah, but Rebecca is awesome.

432
00:28:52,763 --> 00:28:58,749
Speaker 0: It's like well, he should get We you know, it's like, you know, everybody's like the clear good or bad guy.

433
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:02,378
Speaker 1: Frank is a diligent and earnest supporter.

434
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:03,763
Speaker 0: It's still a murderer right?

435
00:29:03,863 --> 00:29:05,067
Speaker 1: No, no Frank not max.

436
00:29:05,127 --> 00:29:05,287
Speaker 1: No.

437
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:06,170
Speaker 0: No Frank is fine.

438
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:10,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, Frank probably knows he knows Frank knows everything but I feel like it's injured.

439
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:20,009
Speaker 1: I think Frank is the kind of character who knows because he figured it out not because max told him no Yeah, and it's not clear very smart figures out that he actually doesn't know, right?

440
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:23,464
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't think he tell Frank ever tells max what he knows, right?

441
00:29:23,524 --> 00:29:24,669
Speaker 0: No, thanks things like don't know.

442
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:28,510
Speaker 0: mr Winter figures out cuz she notices and she she knows that Frank knows.

443
00:29:28,691 --> 00:29:32,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz she confides in Frank cuz you feel like she should have just run away with Frank.

444
00:29:33,012 --> 00:29:35,403
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Frank was like old and he's not that old.

445
00:29:35,463 --> 00:29:42,290
Speaker 0: He's getting old not in the movie But now Rebecca's cousin is a piece of shit, but I guess you know in the movie max is Laurence Olivier.

446
00:29:42,351 --> 00:29:43,768
Speaker 0: So why would you go with anyone else?

447
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:50,895
Speaker 0: Sure, Colonel Julian suspected heavily Yeah, but anyway the point is the.

448
00:29:50,995 --> 00:29:53,863
Speaker 0: the awesome part is how he's just like.

449
00:29:53,883 --> 00:29:55,588
Speaker 0: oh, alright you're accusing me.

450
00:29:56,009 --> 00:29:56,977
Speaker 0: fine Let's go.

451
00:29:56,998 --> 00:29:58,210
Speaker 0: Fuck you, right?

452
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:04,655
Speaker 0: It's like he's not like trying to hide it or run like he just confronts it head-on and he's like We're just gonna go explore.

453
00:30:04,675 --> 00:30:05,559
Speaker 0: Let's explore everything.

454
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:05,779
Speaker 0: Sure.

455
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,205
Speaker 0: You want to see what's in the kit.

456
00:30:07,245 --> 00:30:08,208
Speaker 0: I'll show you everything.

457
00:30:08,268 --> 00:30:08,710
Speaker 0: I'm exposed.

458
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:10,005
Speaker 0: Here's all the papers.

459
00:30:10,046 --> 00:30:10,309
Speaker 0: Let's go.

460
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:15,450
Speaker 1: I wonder about that because on one hand he might because his perspective is very different from the cousin.

461
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:16,574
Speaker 1: I forget that shit heads name.

462
00:30:16,594 --> 00:30:18,903
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, but favel favel favel.

463
00:30:19,245 --> 00:30:20,570
Speaker 1: So favel favel.

464
00:30:21,511 --> 00:30:34,470
Speaker 1: so on one hand from Max's perspective if all the dirty laundry came out that Rebecca was bone and her husband or her Cousin and everybody else on the planet would ruin favel's name and Rebecca's and his it's like I'll tie the grenade to myself.

465
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:35,252
Speaker 1: We'll all go down.

466
00:30:35,272 --> 00:30:41,470
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, but that's only true from his perspective of being in high society.

467
00:30:42,272 --> 00:30:43,619
Speaker 1: But I will doesn't give a shit about.

468
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,630
Speaker 0: could you imagine like I rob a bank right?

469
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:50,530
Speaker 0: yeah, and the cops come to investigate and there's Some.

470
00:30:51,152 --> 00:30:52,698
Speaker 0: you know, there's not super strong evidence.

471
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:55,387
Speaker 0: They can't take me in right away, but there's probable cause.

472
00:30:55,407 --> 00:30:56,250
Speaker 0: they think they're pretty sure.

473
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:56,652
Speaker 0: It's me.

474
00:30:56,672 --> 00:30:59,683
Speaker 0: they got ideas and they got to investigate because it's it's.

475
00:31:00,004 --> 00:31:01,530
Speaker 0: it looks like there's a possibility.

476
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:04,843
Speaker 0: So you start to investigate and I just fully cooperate.

477
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:05,486
Speaker 0: I'm just like yeah.

478
00:31:05,927 --> 00:31:07,394
Speaker 1: Oh my god Scott You know you need to watch.

479
00:31:07,474 --> 00:31:08,681
Speaker 0: you want to see what's in my closet.

480
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,289
Speaker 0: I'm open up all my closets to you.

481
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:11,273
Speaker 0: cops I don't have to.

482
00:31:11,313 --> 00:31:15,989
Speaker 1: you don't got a warrant, but I'm gonna show you God you have got to watch the Fargo TV show.

483
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:19,393
Speaker 0: This is someone who does that Holy shit.

484
00:31:19,955 --> 00:31:21,542
Speaker 0: Oh you want to see my bank records here?

485
00:31:21,642 --> 00:31:23,490
Speaker 0: Here's my bank records for the last ten years.

486
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,057
Speaker 1: So here's a perspective on that.

487
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:26,745
Speaker 0: It might was I on this night.

488
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:32,229
Speaker 1: That's where I was on this night I'm telling everyone and it might have been max assuming mutually assured destruction like bring it.

489
00:31:32,691 --> 00:31:36,690
Speaker 1: It might have also been Max resigned to his fate cuz he did not right.

490
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:40,330
Speaker 0: He did not know about the cancer and that he was good.

491
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:43,361
Speaker 0: He did not know he was gonna like be saved by this investigation.

492
00:31:43,381 --> 00:31:45,208
Speaker 0: right he was even he figured.

493
00:31:45,629 --> 00:31:46,617
Speaker 0: you know He's just like all right.

494
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:50,378
Speaker 0: They're gonna keep investigating We're gonna go through with it, and they're gonna find out the truth.

495
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,703
Speaker 0: Let's just go.

496
00:31:52,104 --> 00:31:53,128
Speaker 0: Let's just go through with it.

497
00:31:53,348 --> 00:31:55,618
Speaker 0: Yep He doesn't admit it.

498
00:31:55,699 --> 00:31:57,410
Speaker 0: He doesn't like break down and admit it ever.

499
00:31:57,953 --> 00:32:00,227
Speaker 0: But he's just like let's go through with it and see what you can find.

500
00:32:00,248 --> 00:32:03,429
Speaker 0: you know I'll fully cooperate and then he just sort of lucks out.

501
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:13,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I actually reading this I Wondered because Frank basically took the phone call and like arranged all that meeting.

502
00:32:14,552 --> 00:32:26,810
Speaker 1: I actually suspected heavily that that was not a real doctor and that Frank actually set this up Where this fake doctor would pretend to be a retired doctor and pull out this file and be like oh?

503
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,209
Speaker 1: And just like neatly tie everything together, and I thought it was a big ploy.

504
00:32:30,852 --> 00:32:31,353
Speaker 0: Frank did.

505
00:32:31,494 --> 00:32:32,336
Speaker 0: it's not as a real though.

506
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:34,844
Speaker 1: I suspected that when the scene was happy.

507
00:32:34,885 --> 00:32:36,048
Speaker 0: I think that's too clever, right?

508
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:41,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I see Frank doing something like like the book like the story has stuff, but it that's too much.

509
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:43,149
Speaker 0: That's like one step too far.

510
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:48,668
Speaker 1: I was pleasantly surprised that that that did not seem to be the case right cuz I didn't know either.

511
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:50,093
Speaker 0: How could it right?

512
00:32:50,615 --> 00:32:51,518
Speaker 1: well Frank did know.

513
00:32:51,579 --> 00:32:54,530
Speaker 0: he knew the murder happened no, but he didn't know about the cancer.

514
00:32:54,611 --> 00:32:55,560
Speaker 0: No, that would have been made up.

515
00:32:55,661 --> 00:32:56,590
Speaker 1: It was all made up.

516
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:03,770
Speaker 1: He told someone to tell this story the end and that would be too much because it was a conveniently retired doctor Not at a doctor's office.

517
00:33:04,632 --> 00:33:05,949
Speaker 0: Documents and shit.

518
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,770
Speaker 1: Donald Trump had a big pile of documents.

519
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:13,619
Speaker 0: It's not the same Documents documents is that the same?

520
00:33:13,779 --> 00:33:13,920
Speaker 1: cuz?

521
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,489
Speaker 1: also Colonel Julian really heavily leans on favelle like.

522
00:33:16,689 --> 00:33:18,296
Speaker 1: well I don't look into this any deeper.

523
00:33:18,356 --> 00:33:19,561
Speaker 0: that is another thing right?

524
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,870
Speaker 1: is it a little nervous when?

525
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:23,154
Speaker 1: Julian was the.

526
00:33:23,215 --> 00:33:28,409
Speaker 1: Julian said don't worry if he ever causes trouble for you again The doctor's testimony would be enough.

527
00:33:29,193 --> 00:33:42,379
Speaker 0: One thing seem comforted by that one thing that works in Max's favor Which is I think why he takes the strategy is he knows that Colonel Julian already had is already on Max's side Yeah, and against favelle, so he's gonna.

528
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,330
Speaker 0: You know he's gonna need like imposter like absolute.

529
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:54,074
Speaker 0: You know no reasonable doubt proved to be convinced and until then is going to come up with some other explanation for the evidence That makes you know.

530
00:33:54,094 --> 00:34:01,357
Speaker 0: yeah, cuz there's basically all that is they keep making up whenever there's evidence that appears like oh this boat Looks like someone murdered her in this boat.

531
00:34:01,899 --> 00:34:04,207
Speaker 0: right and he's like and it wasn't suicide.

532
00:34:04,227 --> 00:34:08,768
Speaker 0: and he's like well Maybe she did do it herself and locked herself in.

533
00:34:09,312 --> 00:34:09,955
Speaker 0: It's like they're.

534
00:34:09,975 --> 00:34:12,949
Speaker 0: basically he's going through because he's on Max's side.

535
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:19,967
Speaker 0: He's coming up with any explanation He can that where Max will still be innocent up even though the explanation of Max did it.

536
00:34:20,047 --> 00:34:20,889
Speaker 0: is there really the easy?

537
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,996
Speaker 1: Decide because one like don't rock the boat.

538
00:34:24,137 --> 00:34:27,366
Speaker 1: You know society and two he dines with that dude.

539
00:34:27,406 --> 00:34:28,830
Speaker 1: They're both upper-class.

540
00:34:29,591 --> 00:34:32,842
Speaker 0: So you couldn't imagine right that that would even be the case like it's like.

541
00:34:32,882 --> 00:34:34,228
Speaker 0: you couldn't even think that that was like.

542
00:34:35,212 --> 00:34:40,469
Speaker 1: You see favelle's victory in that Julian wouldn't have even like he would have just been like nope this is bullshit.

543
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:46,129
Speaker 1: But favelle at least had enough evidence to get Julian to say well I guess I got a look into this.

544
00:34:46,632 --> 00:34:51,130
Speaker 0: I mean like imagine if you know like rim died on the ski slope.

545
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,074
Speaker 0: Yeah How much would it?

546
00:34:53,195 --> 00:35:04,910
Speaker 0: how much evidence would have to appear before I would even consider like Emily pushed him off the skis Right like that would not even be considered even you know even though the tons of evidence like right it would.

547
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:09,450
Speaker 0: That wouldn't even be a possible explanation that would even come to mind.

548
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:12,188
Speaker 0: I like the point unless there was like a video of it.

549
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,259
Speaker 1: Beatrice is like oh my god.

550
00:35:14,299 --> 00:35:16,350
Speaker 1: I heard they're saying it's suicide.

551
00:35:16,716 --> 00:35:17,550
Speaker 1: That's bullshit.

552
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:22,248
Speaker 1: and I want to start shit to get people to realize it wasn't suicide and then be.

553
00:35:22,509 --> 00:35:24,576
Speaker 1: and then Max or bet and mrs.

554
00:35:24,597 --> 00:35:26,664
Speaker 1: De winter are like no, that's okay.

555
00:35:27,086 --> 00:35:27,789
Speaker 1: Just let that be.

556
00:35:28,271 --> 00:35:32,089
Speaker 0: Don't worry about that don't rock the boat.

557
00:35:35,313 --> 00:35:37,201
Speaker 1: So yeah, I'm pretty sure mrs.

558
00:35:37,241 --> 00:35:40,637
Speaker 1: Danvers just fucking burn the house down - No, that's oh.

559
00:35:40,677 --> 00:35:44,355
Speaker 0: so that's in the movie, right The end of the movie.

560
00:35:44,516 --> 00:35:47,770
Speaker 0: actually they come up to the house as it's burning.

561
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:48,652
Speaker 1: Yeah Do it.

562
00:35:48,692 --> 00:35:55,127
Speaker 0: the other book - that's the famous scene in the movie is they're standing in front of the burning Manderley and like mrs.

563
00:35:55,167 --> 00:36:03,980
Speaker 0: Danvers I think is inside burning with it now and they zoom in on the pillow on the bed with Like the famous movie ending right is?

564
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,710
Speaker 0: that's how you know that you've seen this movie and not some other movie.

565
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:10,208
Speaker 0: That's sort of like the rosebud sled at the end of citizen Kane.

566
00:36:10,228 --> 00:36:17,430
Speaker 0: now It's the pillow with the R on it at the end of Rebecca is like the yeah And then the the the end shows up on the screen while the pillows on fire.

567
00:36:18,673 --> 00:36:21,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, but in the book, it's gonna call like mrs.

568
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:26,473
Speaker 1: Danvers took all her shit and left and then the house mysteriously set on fire The end hmm.

569
00:36:26,894 --> 00:36:39,389
Speaker 1: Yep, but I like how the book went full circle because remember it started with two basically nameless characters Avoiding talking about anything at all, right, which is like, okay, they didn't get he didn't go to jail, right?

570
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:42,520
Speaker 0: But basically it's like yeah, they did sort of get.

571
00:36:42,861 --> 00:36:45,250
Speaker 0: you know, these these bad people deserve each other.

572
00:36:45,612 --> 00:36:50,333
Speaker 0: It's like yeah now you have a boring shitty life traveling around alone But at the same time it did.

573
00:36:50,454 --> 00:36:55,489
Speaker 1: that's that you get the impression that that is right after and that they could recover from this.

574
00:36:56,151 --> 00:36:57,395
Speaker 1: Mmm, because they do.

575
00:36:57,495 --> 00:36:58,277
Speaker 1: they both know.

576
00:36:58,337 --> 00:37:02,930
Speaker 1: now like they have a topic they avoid but they both have a full understanding of that topic.

577
00:37:03,614 --> 00:37:09,699
Speaker 0: Mmm, they're sort of you know, but they're like, you know They're sort of back to where max was before he met her.

578
00:37:09,759 --> 00:37:16,850
Speaker 0: only now they're both in it together right traveling around, you know Boring not but the ghost is dead.

579
00:37:17,091 --> 00:37:20,059
Speaker 1: They cannot go back home before.

580
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:26,502
Speaker 1: one problem for max is that his whole life was wrapped around Manderley the stupid house, so he's away from it.

581
00:37:26,663 --> 00:37:28,330
Speaker 1: wish I had a house, but it's all hot.

582
00:37:28,632 --> 00:37:30,181
Speaker 1: It's like the waterfall house even that shit.

583
00:37:30,261 --> 00:37:31,187
Speaker 0: He did not use that house.

584
00:37:31,247 --> 00:37:35,886
Speaker 0: Well, I Had if I had some kind of man that Rebecca used it right.

585
00:37:35,927 --> 00:37:38,942
Speaker 1: Rebecca was like Yeah, like half the time we invited so many people over.

586
00:37:39,002 --> 00:37:40,630
Speaker 1: people are like sleeping in the foyer.

587
00:37:41,433 --> 00:37:43,567
Speaker 0: If I had an estate, that's how it would go down.

588
00:37:45,732 --> 00:37:54,418
Speaker 0: You gotta be like the Great Gatsby like I wouldn't be letting my cottage on the beach have any cobwebs in it You know, I'd be using that boat every day.

589
00:37:54,438 --> 00:38:00,244
Speaker 1: All right, so a modern point but in the beginning of the book For mrs.

590
00:38:00,264 --> 00:38:16,747
Speaker 1: De Winter Is kind of the is an insufferably boring kind of person that I would avoid because if you don't know her inner universe Which is quashed by society around her like, you know all her imagination like all none of that seems to come out of her into the real world.

591
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:21,290
Speaker 1: because Even before max everyone in her life up to that point is basically forced her to be meek.

592
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:26,430
Speaker 1: So she ends up being really boring and cut the kind of person to avoid.

593
00:38:26,831 --> 00:38:33,781
Speaker 1: so you wonder if max sort of wasn't drawn to her use so much as the fact that she Was a she was.

594
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:39,905
Speaker 1: it would be easy to avoid Anything with her because she would just kind of sit idle if nothing happened.

595
00:38:40,286 --> 00:38:42,413
Speaker 0: I actually kind of like Ms.

596
00:38:42,473 --> 00:38:45,102
Speaker 0: Van whatever name is at the beginning.

597
00:38:45,664 --> 00:38:47,190
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah the she's you she is.

598
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:54,090
Speaker 1: She's like a side character in a musical like in the beginning who's like introducing people and like telling the framing story, right?

599
00:38:54,170 --> 00:39:01,324
Speaker 0: But it's like while she's obviously the kind of person to be like annoying to be with Right and like oh so fake and you know, whatever.

600
00:39:01,344 --> 00:39:02,650
Speaker 1: now, why don't we be like that when we're old?

601
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:06,330
Speaker 1: Why don't we be the old people who like pull up outside of like packs, right?

602
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:09,479
Speaker 0: But at the same time where she's sort of that like the annoying character.

603
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:11,766
Speaker 0: She's also like not stupid.

604
00:39:11,786 --> 00:39:21,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, and also Kind of really capable and is living life, you know, well, it's like she's got a family she's close with them She likes to travel she's spending your money.

605
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,941
Speaker 0: Well, right, you know, she You know lives the good life.

606
00:39:26,002 --> 00:39:27,310
Speaker 0: She's delicious food.

607
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:34,290
Speaker 1: Well, like she is very insincere but only around these social things to like engender and endear herself to other people.

608
00:39:34,814 --> 00:39:36,830
Speaker 1: But the rest of her life seems pretty genuine, right?

609
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,476
Speaker 0: And then you know, that's him.

610
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,121
Speaker 1: the core of his life is disingenuous.

611
00:39:40,161 --> 00:39:41,285
Speaker 0: now and then when mrs.

612
00:39:41,325 --> 00:39:49,273
Speaker 0: Dewinter is like, oh, yeah I'm leaving by she's like, oh suddenly she gives her like the real advice, you know, she's like, oh good luck Time.

613
00:39:49,674 --> 00:39:55,350
Speaker 1: she was also pigeon-holing that young girl into being nothing but what she was for the rest of her life.

614
00:39:55,913 --> 00:39:58,569
Speaker 1: There was no path for her out of that life.

615
00:39:58,991 --> 00:40:02,142
Speaker 0: Well being married to someone her own age that wasn't?

616
00:40:02,544 --> 00:40:04,370
Speaker 0: it have a horrible mansion and not a murderer.

617
00:40:04,631 --> 00:40:07,499
Speaker 1: But the way she treated her she like.

618
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,149
Speaker 1: I don't think she would ever grow into her own and become an adult.

619
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,699
Speaker 0: You could she could have become an adult just like mrs.

620
00:40:13,759 --> 00:40:14,401
Speaker 0: Van whatever.

621
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:20,036
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a fate worse than death But it's fine to be that person.

622
00:40:20,177 --> 00:40:21,882
Speaker 0: Yeah, but she wasn't an evil person.

623
00:40:21,902 --> 00:40:23,006
Speaker 0: She wasn't hurting anyone.

624
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:24,110
Speaker 0: She's just annoying people.

625
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:28,716
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it better than better than murdering people Murdering also the rich.

626
00:40:28,917 --> 00:40:32,010
Speaker 1: I'm the rich young dilettante who comes to stay in Monte Carlo.

627
00:40:33,213 --> 00:40:39,490
Speaker 0: Actually, you would be you are miss man, whatever you would be like, oh who's staying in the hotel?

Speaker 0: You are that annoying old lady.

633
00:40:56,222 --> 00:40:57,748
Speaker 1: I would beg to differ.

634
00:40:57,828 --> 00:40:58,250
Speaker 0: you are.

635
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:01,355

Speaker 1: she doesn't barge his place cards, which is also what you do spoonie bard, maybe You are.

Speaker 0: She's good at it.

643
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,915
Speaker 1: You know what actually a big problem with mr.

644
00:41:15,935 --> 00:41:18,062
Speaker 1: Winter is that she is not good at cards.

645
00:41:18,283 --> 00:41:19,808
Speaker 1: No, like not at all.

646
00:41:20,069 --> 00:41:22,478
Speaker 0: No Yeah, she doesn't have.

647
00:41:22,518 --> 00:41:23,930
Speaker 0: the only skill she has is drawing.

648
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:27,785
Speaker 0: Doesn't come into play like they keep bringing up that like that's.

649
00:41:27,846 --> 00:41:28,790
Speaker 0: her hobby is drawing.

650
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:35,690

651
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:39,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it was a very idle hobby and it's very noteworthy that she's not good at it.

652
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:43,447
Speaker 0: But she did it well enough for the dressmaker to make the exact dress true true.

653
00:41:43,508 --> 00:41:43,990
Speaker 1: That is true.

654
00:41:44,431 --> 00:41:48,605
Speaker 1: But otherwise like she doesn't do it like she avoids it in the house.

655
00:41:48,725 --> 00:41:50,270
Speaker 0: It's like she doesn't have other skills.

656
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:50,612
Speaker 0: She doesn't.

657
00:41:50,693 --> 00:41:51,880

00:42:01,179 --> 00:42:02,463
Speaker 1: Yeah playing with the one dog.

Speaker 0: Yeah, mrs do.

671
00:42:16,132 --> 00:42:23,004
Speaker 1: she may have only been able to do that by seducing and then blackmailing someone and Threatening to ruin his life.

672
00:42:23,024 --> 00:42:23,570
Speaker 0: better than killing.

673
00:42:25,995 --> 00:42:27,147
Speaker 1: Of course she was gonna die anyway.

674
00:42:28,911 --> 00:42:30,377
Speaker 0: Point is who you want.

675
00:42:30,397 --> 00:42:32,245

Speaker 0: Winter.

677
00:42:32,647 --> 00:42:33,329

680
00:42:38,934 --> 00:42:40,925

Speaker 1: Yeah You want to you want to share you want to hang out with her and favelle have a good night.

00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,625
Speaker 1: favelle is gonna be around.

684
00:42:48,645 --> 00:42:49,369
Speaker 1: That's the problem.

685
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:52,076
Speaker 1: Favelle is the worst character in this novel.

686
00:42:52,296 --> 00:42:53,038
Speaker 0: Hey in those days.

687
00:42:53,098 --> 00:42:54,221
Speaker 0: It was okay to duel people.

688
00:42:54,602 --> 00:42:56,187
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it duel him.

689
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:58,453
Speaker 1: I Like how even mrs.

690
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:03,569
Speaker 1: Dewinter is like wow, he's gonna be and I'll go in like ten more years.

691
00:43:03,952 --> 00:43:04,661
Speaker 0: He's busy Biff.

692
00:43:04,964 --> 00:43:05,147
Speaker 1: Yeah.

693
00:43:07,452 --> 00:43:08,497
Speaker 1: So here's the question Scott.

694
00:43:08,959 --> 00:43:23,889
Speaker 1: if when Colonel Julian and Max are there If max had just shot favelle and the three of them hit his body, but that have been okay I don't think Colonel Julian wouldn't let it go Even like are you shot someone right when max fucking punched him out?

695
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:27,619
Speaker 1: Colonel Julian just quietly turned his back and stood there.

696
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe you cuz favelle is the worst person.

697
00:43:31,271 --> 00:43:33,123
Speaker 0: It's still 1940 something right?

698
00:43:33,184 --> 00:43:37,342
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, there's a good book good movie.

699
00:43:38,026 --> 00:43:38,610
Speaker 0: It's good times.

700
00:43:38,771 --> 00:43:45,880
Speaker 1: There are deep complexities here that I'm not really qualified to try to Go into but there's a lot going on for a book.

701
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:47,806
Speaker 0: That was like originally like.

702
00:43:48,287 --> 00:43:51,918
Speaker 0: oh like a Bad romance novel right isn't.

703
00:43:52,078 --> 00:43:54,786
Speaker 0: and then you know amazing movie right is like thing is.

704
00:43:54,866 --> 00:43:58,296
Speaker 1: it's actually a really good Romance novel about a bad romance.

705
00:43:58,577 --> 00:44:02,048
Speaker 0: I'm just saying is like a book that was originally treated like it was.

706
00:44:02,289 --> 00:44:04,424
Speaker 0: you know Trash right is actually.

707
00:44:04,445 --> 00:44:06,532
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Reception.

708
00:44:06,552 --> 00:44:16,307
Speaker 1: well there was definitely a. there was this line cuz we read the liner notes for this that talked about how Gothic romance was a very like powerful avenue of feminist expression during the era.

709
00:44:16,367 --> 00:44:22,770
Speaker 1: this book was written And it was often written off as trashy romance when actually there's a lot going on right.

710
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:24,757
Speaker 0: I mean I'm sure you're not gonna be able to make like.

711
00:44:24,898 --> 00:44:30,809
Speaker 0: if you bought some romance novel on the shelf today at the grocery store Right could you make like an amazing movie out of it?

712
00:44:31,632 --> 00:44:35,245
Speaker 0: It's like you know I don't think the Fifty Shades of Grey movie.

713
00:44:35,265 --> 00:44:42,150
Speaker 0: not that I've seen it or read the book But pretty sure it's not even remotely close to being as good as this movie or book.

714
00:44:42,634 --> 00:44:43,360
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't.

715
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,549
Speaker 1: I did not even catch this.

716
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:46,035
Speaker 1: I'm just flipping through things here.

717
00:44:46,055 --> 00:44:49,507
Speaker 1: the opening line of the book is an iambic hexameter.

718
00:44:49,989 --> 00:44:56,260
Speaker 1: last night I dreamt I went to Mandalay again, okay There's all these little bits that I'm not gonna.

719
00:44:56,441 --> 00:44:58,006
Speaker 1: you can read the Wikipedia article right.

720
00:44:58,046 --> 00:45:02,610
