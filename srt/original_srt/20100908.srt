00:00:35,142 --> 00:00:38,636

13
00:00:49,193 --> 00:00:51,490
Speaker 1: I'll tell you everything that happened at PAX in another episode.

14
00:00:52,156 --> 00:01:01,770
Speaker 1: I don't really feel like it now But if I have to say one thing to prove that PAX happened I can say that the the final round of the Omega thon was the omega.

15
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,928
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay Omega claw I win.

16
00:01:08,293 --> 00:01:13,470
Speaker 0: So for any of you who are new listeners You're wondering what's going on geek nights is four different shows four nights a week.

17
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,742
Speaker 0: You know Mondays like science and neck beards and all that.

18
00:01:16,064 --> 00:01:17,090
Speaker 0: Tuesdays is what you want.

19
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:21,090
Speaker 0: Tuesdays is your gaming, but you know, I ran into a lot of anime fans at PAX.

20
00:01:21,191 --> 00:01:23,589
Speaker 0: We saw three anime world order hoodies at PAX.

21
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:28,863
Speaker 1: In fact during what I think one of them was the same guy twice But during one of our panels we were like hey who watches anime?

22
00:01:28,883 --> 00:01:34,927
Speaker 1: and a whole bunch of people raise their hand But they clearly they weren't hardcore anime fans because we said who is seen or heard of summer wars?

23
00:01:34,967 --> 00:01:38,625
Speaker 0: and almost nobody But a bunch of the enforcers really watched anime.

24
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:43,984
Speaker 0: the good one of the cool guys I was talking to you after the late show was all about fist of the North Star.

25
00:01:44,064 --> 00:01:44,626
Speaker 1: No snap.

26
00:01:44,686 --> 00:01:49,849
Speaker 1: Yeah, so was Our recent interview Marcos Ove and is all about this the North Star.

27
00:01:50,771 --> 00:01:54,966
Speaker 0: It's kind of cool that you go to Otacon and like the people there are really not anime fans.

28
00:01:55,026 --> 00:01:55,267
Speaker 0: alert.

29
00:01:55,408 --> 00:01:58,199
Speaker 0: when I say Otacon I guess I use that to mean like any anime con.

30
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:01,130
Speaker 0: a lot of people are not super into anime.

31
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,870
Speaker 0: They're kind of just there and into anime culture and they watch a little bit anime.

32
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:14,170
Speaker 0: But all the random people I kind of talked to at PAX where anime came up They were just kind of casual anime fans and they'd seen way more anime than the average anime con attendee.

33
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:14,532
Speaker 1: I think.

34
00:02:14,572 --> 00:02:28,870
Speaker 1: is they just seen more better anime because they're only watching the good stuff Whereas the so-called anime fans at the anime cons are watching tons of crap like Naruto and bleach which are tons and tons of episodes that are really terrible, but is there really tons of anime?

35
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,544
Speaker 0: I mean, they're watching tons of individual episodes, but not tons of different shows.

36
00:02:32,765 --> 00:02:33,247
Speaker 0: That's true.

37
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:39,970
Speaker 1: It's exactly right Whereas the more casual fans are watching only the really quality popular stuff or the stuff from their youth.

38
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:41,535
Speaker 1: But they're watching all this.

39
00:02:41,555 --> 00:02:46,190
Speaker 1: good stuff such as you know goes in the shell movies and Miyazaki movies.

40
00:02:46,354 --> 00:02:54,346
Speaker 0: It was funny though At least some of the enforcers I was talking to in a gaggle on Saturday We're talking about how yeah, they were really into like Naruto and bleach and really?

41
00:02:54,387 --> 00:02:55,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's interesting.

42
00:02:55,411 --> 00:02:57,343
Speaker 0: But then they also had seen cowboy bebop.

43
00:02:57,383 --> 00:03:03,510
Speaker 0: it goes to the shell and all that All right, and remember we when I got into anime, I was watching Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon.

44
00:03:04,431 --> 00:03:06,719
Speaker 0: I did not of course when I really got into anime.

45
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:12,529
Speaker 0: I watched vampire hunter D and project echo, but I did All right, yeah, I did both.

46
00:03:13,253 --> 00:03:26,056
Speaker 0: But the funny thing is of the anime world order hoodie people one of them And I didn't catch his name because we saw him like we were getting in the elevator Like Saturday night to go pass out and this guy's like walking by in the lobby like yo anime world order And he's like yo geek nights.

47
00:03:26,156 --> 00:03:26,578
Speaker 0: What up?

48
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:29,990
Speaker 0: I used to listen to you, but I disagreed with you about some anime.

49
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:30,970
Speaker 0: So I stopped listening.

69
00:04:09,052 --> 00:04:11,226
Speaker 0: It'd be very difficult to have a war with those guys.

00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:11,930
Speaker 0: cuz what am I gonna say?

71
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,144

79
00:04:27,788 --> 00:04:28,210
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

80
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:31,543
Speaker 1: There's no point having a war with someone who is already dead.

81
00:04:31,663 --> 00:04:35,236
Speaker 0: I Must be causing so much trouble for Emily.

82

86
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:49,580
Speaker 0: I'm weird.

00:04:49,802 --> 00:04:50,509
Speaker 1: Why do you do that?

88
00:04:50,811 --> 00:04:54,382
Speaker 1: I just do you think you need to eject the Stan Lee from your body.

89
00:04:54,402 --> 00:05:00,301
Speaker 1: I'm not bolding when I say oh my It's equally corny in fact perhaps even more corn.

90
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:00,983
Speaker 1: is it really corny?

91
00:05:01,044 --> 00:05:02,409

00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:08,190
Speaker 0: see I don't think it's corny.

94
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,089
Speaker 0: I will argue that what I do is just weird.

95
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:11,792
Speaker 1: It's corny.

96
00:05:11,953 --> 00:05:13,878
Speaker 0: now corny is this whole different level.

00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:14,580
Speaker 1: it makes it.

98
00:05:14,841 --> 00:05:17,910
Speaker 1: it causes everyone near you to groan in pain.

99
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:20,732
Speaker 1: Therefore you should not do it Everyone.

00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:43,713
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is?

112
00:05:44,014 --> 00:05:48,068
Speaker 0: that's probably the only gap in her anime watching experience.

113
00:05:48,108 --> 00:05:49,574
Speaker 0: at this point I mean mm-hmm.

114
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:53,508
Speaker 0: she she's into anime as much as we are and that's the only show I can think of.

115
00:05:53,528 --> 00:05:57,030
Speaker 1: try gun was one Of my favorite shows when I first saw is still one of my favorite shows.

116
00:05:58,214 --> 00:05:59,759
Speaker 1: I never got the whole box.

117
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,769
Speaker 1: I think I only bought the final DVD for some because we had to watch the.

118
00:06:04,796 --> 00:06:14,043
Speaker 1: But anyway the We never got the full box set because it was always like a zillion dollars And it never got cheap, and they never made a thin pass.

119
00:06:14,084 --> 00:06:14,868
Speaker 0: so it got re-released.

Speaker 0: No shipping basically no sales tax.

125
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:36,250
Speaker 0: This is why anime con dealers do not get my money anymore because I in the last like three years you walk in there you Look at the box set on the table like the $5 bin, and I'm like all right.

126
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,398

Speaker 0: That's a really good price for the whole show, but then I thought about it And I realized that 13 bucks is really not worth it.

154
00:07:52,824 --> 00:08:00,910
Speaker 0: cuz at that point The space that those DVDs take up in my apartment is almost not worth owning the show because maybe I'll watch it again once ever.

155
00:08:01,452 --> 00:08:05,586
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll lend it to someone once or twice, but that's really it.

156
00:08:05,847 --> 00:08:06,730
Speaker 0: I can't think of anyone.

157
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,299
Speaker 0: I know I'm gonna lend gonkotsuo to that.

158
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:13,319
Speaker 0: I don't already have to lend like bebop Ava, Eska, Trigon Eska flow.

159
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:21,168
Speaker 1: if it was if it was $13 right for like it's like 50 cents an episode for HD downloads that were free of DRM.

160
00:08:21,248 --> 00:08:21,870
Speaker 1: I might have bought it.

161
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,801
Speaker 1: I would have bought that yeah, but for DVDs.

162
00:08:24,861 --> 00:08:27,010
Speaker 1: It's like I don't want these DVDs taking up room in my house.

163
00:08:27,491 --> 00:08:37,770
Speaker 1: Also, I heard from reliable source that there were extras on the original DVDs and that thin case Does not have the because I wanted to fit it on for DVDs, but who cares about the extras?

164
00:08:38,071 --> 00:08:39,034
Speaker 1: What do you need extras for?

165
00:08:39,075 --> 00:08:42,750
Speaker 0: the extras are supposed to be awesome like a new town where they had all that useless bullshit.

166
00:08:43,332 --> 00:08:48,070
Speaker 1: The only extras in any DVD I've ever wanted were the South Park and also Futurama.

167
00:08:48,412 --> 00:08:55,058
Speaker 0: I did enjoy some of the commentary and the interviews on the ghost in the shell But there was all like original Japanese extras.

168
00:08:55,078 --> 00:09:00,338
Speaker 0: a lot of these DVDs have like American extras that just suck Or they have just the art gallery only.

169
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:08,890
Speaker 1: the only things I ever want to see are really short And really insightful commentaries by the actual creators of the thing not by some American voice actors or adapters.

170
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,920
Speaker 0: Hey to be fair the full commentary track to these had.

171
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,846
Speaker 0: a movie is worth it just to hear him being like.

172
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:24,840
Speaker 1: I Really like that sort of thing, but I also want to see Deleted scenes and that sort of stuff because even though I know deleted scenes are deleted for a reason because they suck It's still.

173
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:39,785
Speaker 1: they're still interesting Yeah, and the other oh, there's actually one other kind of extra that is good, and that is the omak a kind of thing for Example Minnie Pato or lotus island lotus island or What's on the the Hypno toad.

174
00:09:39,805 --> 00:09:43,057
Speaker 0: oh Was that really extra?

175
00:09:43,097 --> 00:09:45,184
Speaker 0: that was a full episode of course, that's.

176
00:09:45,224 --> 00:09:46,166
Speaker 1: that's why that's what.

177
00:09:46,227 --> 00:09:47,350
Speaker 1: that's what an omak a is.

178
00:09:47,431 --> 00:09:55,070
Speaker 1: It's actually extra Actual real content that's on there not some addendum sort of half content like a commentary.

179
00:09:55,391 --> 00:09:56,034
Speaker 1: It's an actual.

180
00:09:56,074 --> 00:09:59,649
Speaker 1: hey look you buy this DVD you get an actual extra episode sort of like.

181
00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:10,550
Speaker 1: you know They do that in comic sometimes like buy this comic and guess what there's actually another comic in it an Actual real comic not just like a page of something or an ad an actual extra comic free.

182
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:15,908
Speaker 1: So when you buy you know that's a real extra whatever All right.

183
00:10:16,743 --> 00:10:26,670
Speaker 1: So yeah So that the reason that gun could sue it was so cheap is because apparently there's this funimation save Program sa ve and they're selling save anime or save money.

184
00:10:26,931 --> 00:10:29,500
Speaker 0: I think it's save money because it's not save anime.

185
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,198
Speaker 0: cuz the thing I've seen in the anime community lately is oh my god Bye DVDs.

186
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,330
Speaker 0: We're all going out of business.

187
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:38,828
Speaker 1: Well, it definitely saves the customer money because they have all these anime series for like 15 bucks.

188
00:10:39,913 --> 00:10:41,279
Speaker 0: I'm not paying 15 bucks.

189
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,806
Speaker 0: I don't need the anime.

190
00:10:42,846 --> 00:10:43,670
Speaker 0: This is where they fail.

191
00:10:43,871 --> 00:10:47,310
Speaker 1: Well the thing is I went down the list and I looked at every single one of the shows.

192
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,942
Speaker 1: I was like nope nope nope nope nope except for one and I bought it.

193
00:10:51,103 --> 00:10:51,765
Speaker 0: What show was that?

194
00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:53,150
Speaker 1: galaxy railway?

195
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,617
Speaker 0: But you know what I. you know what I found out.

196
00:10:55,939 --> 00:10:59,010
Speaker 1: you find out there's actually galaxy railways too, and they don't have that.

197
00:10:59,092 --> 00:10:59,789
Speaker 1: It's unlicensed.

198
00:11:01,632 --> 00:11:05,050
Speaker 1: So this is galaxy railways one only which is which is a full series.

199
00:11:05,553 --> 00:11:07,384
Speaker 0: I considered though buying Eden of the East.

200
00:11:07,404 --> 00:11:08,310
Speaker 0: there's like 30 bucks.

201
00:11:08,431 --> 00:11:10,868
Speaker 0: But I kind of just want to watch it, and I don't want I read it.

202
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,058
Speaker 1: I was really I watched it all already.

203
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:13,982
Speaker 0: is it worth buying?

204
00:11:14,384 --> 00:11:15,488
Speaker 0: is it worth watching again ever?

205
00:11:16,211 --> 00:11:17,235
Speaker 1: I would watch it again.

206
00:11:17,336 --> 00:11:18,781
Speaker 1: Maybe in a few years.

207
00:11:18,841 --> 00:11:21,089
Speaker 1: Maybe but I wouldn't buy it yeah.

208
00:11:22,652 --> 00:11:27,782
Speaker 1: So I also bought that book Rules of play that Luke crane is always talking about.

209
00:11:27,842 --> 00:11:28,425
Speaker 0: oh wait wait wait.

00:11:28,445 --> 00:11:29,290
Speaker 0: so not anime stuff.

00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,798
Speaker 0: We're talking about not anime stuff for buying.

212
00:11:30,818 --> 00:11:33,130
Speaker 0: I wanted like a board gaming orgasm spree.

213
00:11:33,412 --> 00:11:33,854
Speaker 1: What'd you buy?

214
00:11:33,874 --> 00:11:34,398
Speaker 1: an Amazon?

00:11:34,478 --> 00:11:35,525
Speaker 0: well cuz we were just at PAX.

Speaker 0: I bought modern art.

217
00:11:36,511 --> 00:11:39,269
Speaker 0: It was like 20 bucks, and that was a fun game to whip out mm-hmm.

00:11:39,591 --> 00:11:41,223
Speaker 0: I bought Zula right oh cuz it was 20 bucks.

222
00:11:50,614 --> 00:11:51,718
Speaker 0: yeah, I didn't have it.

223
00:11:51,798 --> 00:11:52,179
Speaker 0: I got lost.

224
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:54,487
Speaker 0: cities cuz that game is pretty good.

225
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:58,042
Speaker 0: I hear yeah It was like 15, but it's a two people game, which is rare.

226
00:11:58,062 --> 00:11:59,690
Speaker 0: I also finally got some headphones.

227
00:12:00,292 --> 00:12:00,915
Speaker 1: Oh, which can?

228
00:12:01,156 --> 00:12:04,811
Speaker 0: some Panasonic like retro looking pink ones pink ones It's.

229
00:12:04,851 --> 00:12:12,082
Speaker 1: the pink ones were like $30 cheaper than the identical black ones Uh-huh, but to get some pics for the people who will love that.

230
00:12:12,102 --> 00:12:13,005
Speaker 0: I think they're pretty cool.

231
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:16,656
Speaker 0: I'm gonna be a headphone Musume I also bought.

232
00:12:16,676 --> 00:12:18,585
Speaker 1: I have a new strategy for the book club.

233
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:23,105
Speaker 1: I bought the next book club book But you're not gonna say I won't say it on the show until it's time.

234
00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:24,190
Speaker 0: It's not time yet.

235
00:12:24,636 --> 00:12:25,509
Speaker 1: No, I have a new strategy.

236
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:25,953
Speaker 1: I don't even.

237
00:12:26,034 --> 00:12:28,090
Speaker 1: the thing is I don't even know if it'll be a good book.

238
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:31,905
Speaker 1: I actually might be a bad book, but I think it will get people to read.

239
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:39,069
Speaker 0: so huh That's tantalizing because get people to read only means one of two things at least from your perspective.

240
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,282
Speaker 0: one It's a children's book or two.

241
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,550
Speaker 0: it is controversial.

242
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:45,028
Speaker 1: Neither one really yeah, huh?

243
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,255
Speaker 1: Third I did buy something.

244
00:12:47,295 --> 00:12:49,001
Speaker 0: I think you really are gonna want.

245
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,550
Speaker 0: but I got the ultra rare cocoa bean.

246
00:12:56,471 --> 00:13:00,590
Speaker 1: So I guess we should do news, but there is no news or at least there's no news that I care about.

247
00:13:00,811 --> 00:13:06,751
Speaker 0: I mean right stuff said that they're not gonna carry urban visions catalog anymore, but I can't think of what is urban vision have I don't.

248
00:13:06,771 --> 00:13:12,086
Speaker 0: they can't think of anything they have since like gogo 13 or ninja scroll.

249
00:13:12,347 --> 00:13:13,049
Speaker 0: I got like nothing.

250
00:13:13,069 --> 00:13:14,480
Speaker 1: so I want to do a geek bite.

251
00:13:15,005 --> 00:13:19,631
Speaker 1: Geek bite Bye ultra rare geek bite the.

252
00:13:20,172 --> 00:13:29,506
Speaker 1: so I got Scott's box right before packs and I talked about this on there, but it was so awesome And I read the whole thing that now I have to talk about it.

253
00:13:29,566 --> 00:13:34,077
Speaker 1: on geek nights I got this trade paperback called strange tales.

255
00:13:48,716 --> 00:13:52,274

Speaker 0: What do you got for me?

289
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:08,206
Speaker 1: So we were at packs packs West 2010. right and many things happen there But we can't talk about them because then what we talk about when we do the pack show and this show will become full of packs talk and we come the pack show.

290
00:16:09,032 --> 00:16:12,770
Speaker 1: So but that does not mean I cannot steal a thing of the day from packs.

291
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:16,449
Speaker 1: And you know I'm probably gonna steal a bunch of things of the day from packs because I need some things of the day.

292
00:16:17,312 --> 00:16:19,098
Speaker 1: So here is a thing that happened at packs.

293
00:16:19,158 --> 00:16:27,179
Speaker 1: that was I guess indirectly our fault that it happened But I was not present at the time, but luckily it is on the youtubes.

294
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,990
Speaker 1: in This video you see the man John st.

00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,539
Speaker 1: that was a great guy?

300
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,960
Speaker 1: But yeah, here's this video for your entertainment.

301
00:16:57,982 --> 00:17:00,360
Speaker 0: Alright, so I for once do not have a video.

302
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:06,040
Speaker 0: I was gonna do that synchronized walking on College Humor from Japan because typical Wednesday thing of the day fodder.

303
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:11,000
Speaker 0: But instead I have an article that I don't have any commentary about so I figure I'll link to it.

304
00:17:11,362 --> 00:17:13,497
Speaker 0: This is my thing of the day, but then I don't have to talk about it.

305
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:20,339
Speaker 0: It's by W to Arudo who seems to write somewhat inflammatory articles for the Japanese or the Japan Times.

306
00:17:20,461 --> 00:17:23,400
Speaker 1: So it says a Japanese troll not troll.

307
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:28,175
Speaker 0: They're inflammatory, but they're very observational and correct like this is most recent one before.

308
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:32,889
Speaker 0: this talks about how in Japan There's super racism against non-japanese people in hostels.

309
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,918
Speaker 0: And if you're not Japanese, they pretty much won't let you stay in hostels.

310
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:36,460
Speaker 1: That's true?

311
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,440
Speaker 0: Yes, so this sounds true?

312
00:17:38,521 --> 00:17:45,459
Speaker 0: I don't know talks about the jet program and The fact that the Japanese people by and large speak English worse than any other people in the world.

313
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:47,827
Speaker 1: You know, they do.

314
00:17:47,847 --> 00:17:54,714
Speaker 0: they pronounce things pretty poorly But they you know they have perfect grammar and he talks about that in extensive detail.

315
00:17:54,755 --> 00:18:07,818
Speaker 0: as to why he thinks that is and the He gets really into this stuff about the culture of the classroom and what programs like jet really do and what happens when you get Fluent English speaker in a classroom after the kind of tutelage that they get in Japan about English.

316
00:18:07,858 --> 00:18:16,480
Speaker 0: up to that point He basically says they teach English the way they teach Latin in America Mmm, and he makes really interesting points and it's a really good read.

317
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:24,392
Speaker 0: But I didn't really feel like commenting on it on the show other than getting you to read it All righty, and if you want to read about Japan and stuff that is kind of fucked up.

318
00:18:24,994 --> 00:18:26,520
Speaker 0: W tell Ardo is the way to go.

319
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:32,899
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just you know, I worry because it sounds like almost this is like a Fox News person of Japan almost, you know.

320
00:18:33,281 --> 00:18:40,191
Speaker 0: So I wonder and without further ado, I guess it's time for the meta Moment, let's keep the meta moment kind of short.

321
00:18:40,232 --> 00:18:42,060
Speaker 0: here almost everything we care about is done.

00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,352
Speaker 0: We got the New York Anime Festival New York comic-con coming up.

Speaker 0: It's like twenty two to four page short stories.

350
00:20:15,596 --> 00:20:16,480
Speaker 0: It's not that hard.

351
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:19,874
Speaker 1: Is there any other meta stuff we have to cover?

352
00:20:20,055 --> 00:20:21,200
Speaker 1: if there is we'll cover it later.

353
00:20:22,061 --> 00:20:22,905
Speaker 1: That's the end of that moment.

354
00:20:23,066 --> 00:20:26,240
Speaker 0: That was not prepared at all and kind of crappy what?

355

356
00:20:28,885 --> 00:20:30,170
Speaker 0: Let me look up the date.

357
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:36,199
Speaker 0: We're doing something cuz I was looking at the wrong thing No one cares about unless they live in New York.

358
00:20:36,722 --> 00:20:37,063
Speaker 1: We got it.

359
00:20:37,184 --> 00:20:41,140
Speaker 1: We need to get like the non New York convention schedule, you know.

360
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:47,660
Speaker 1: So we can tell like the next, you know relatively major anime gaming comic conventions that are.

361
00:20:48,941 --> 00:20:50,025
Speaker 0: Anybody cares about that stuff?

362
00:20:50,206 --> 00:20:51,671
Speaker 0: probably already knows.

363
00:20:52,153 --> 00:20:53,920
Speaker 1: you'd be surprised how many people like that.

364
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:57,478
Speaker 1: You know they they'll post even in our forums which means they're paying attention to the world.

365
00:20:57,498 --> 00:21:02,219
Speaker 1: a Convention happens near them and they don't find out until after true or even like I remember it nerd NYC.

366
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:05,474
Speaker 0: You know super hardcore gamers and a bunch of them.

367
00:21:05,495 --> 00:21:10,258
Speaker 0: They never heard of packs Penny arcade and yet they're like super video game super board game.

368
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:14,719
Speaker 0: Yep It happens and it's not like they don't like penny arcades like they'd never even heard of it.

369
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,940
Speaker 1: Yep, so we should get like a list of you know cons that are relatively big.

370
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,600
Speaker 1: I don't want to talk about like the Holiday Inn guy shows up selling some comics in a box.

371
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:27,936
Speaker 0: Oh, you mean like that comic con in Wildwood that we go to but it's not a con.

372
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:28,498
Speaker 1: It's just a.

373
00:21:28,618 --> 00:21:29,080
Speaker 0: it's a con.

374
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:29,883
Speaker 1: It's not a con.

375
00:21:29,903 --> 00:21:30,425
Speaker 1: It's a sales.

376
00:21:30,505 --> 00:21:31,589
Speaker 0: It's a convention.

377
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:32,211
Speaker 1: It's not.

378
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,134
Speaker 0: it is a convention.

379
00:21:33,215 --> 00:21:33,777
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

380
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:38,190
Speaker 1: Yes, it is Definition of convention needs to have events to be a convention.

381
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:38,852
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't.

382
00:21:38,952 --> 00:21:39,133
Speaker 0: Yes.

383
00:21:39,213 --> 00:21:40,357
Speaker 0: Just a dealer's room counts.

384
00:21:40,478 --> 00:21:41,140
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

385
00:21:42,382 --> 00:21:43,631
Speaker 1: So then the malls a convention.

386
00:21:43,913 --> 00:21:47,105
Speaker 1: No, okay, that's permanent So any temporary.

387
00:21:47,225 --> 00:21:50,075
Speaker 1: so flee it's a flea market is yeah, basically flea market convention.

388
00:21:50,136 --> 00:21:51,360
Speaker 0: Basically the same thing.

389
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,060
Speaker 1: No, a flea market is not a convention.

390
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,048
Speaker 0: I would argue that they are in fact the same thing.

391
00:21:55,109 --> 00:21:57,820
Speaker 1: a flea market would have to have a scheduled events to be a convention.

392
00:21:58,122 --> 00:22:00,359
Speaker 0: However, I would argue that many conventions do have fleas.

393
00:22:01,163 --> 00:22:01,565
Speaker 1: That is true.

394
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:09,716
Speaker 0: so when you know, we're talking about a Hypno toad as an extra and We actually watch and when I say we I mean me and Scott the entire front row crew.

395
00:22:09,756 --> 00:22:15,920
Speaker 0: for any new listeners who missed this Old episode we watched the entire episode of Hypno toad that was on that one future.

396
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,101
Speaker 0: I'm.

397
00:22:16,121 --> 00:22:19,596
Speaker 1: a thing is I don't remember if anything happened stuff at the end or not.

398
00:22:19,837 --> 00:22:20,660
Speaker 0: quite a bit happened.

399
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,346
Speaker 1: In fact, I don't remember.

400
00:22:22,728 --> 00:22:24,394
Speaker 0: we watch as a group the entire thing.

401
00:22:24,434 --> 00:22:25,900
Speaker 0: No one got bored known when did anything.

402
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:26,845
Speaker 1: In fact, we were bored.

403
00:22:26,865 --> 00:22:28,614
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone looked away from the screen.

404
00:22:29,277 --> 00:22:29,820
Speaker 1: I looked away.

405
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,936
Speaker 0: serotonin problem from the Hobbit joke.

406
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:49,859
Speaker 0: But future Amma animation one of the more important beloved well-known well-loved beloved Cartoons to ever be shown on American television very popular worldwide even and it's Wednesday and we've never talked about it.

407
00:22:50,582 --> 00:22:52,833
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean we're like every I've been.

408
00:22:53,014 --> 00:22:56,437
Speaker 1: I watched a whole bunch of animes But rim really hasn't and I read a whole bunch of comics.

409
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,951
Speaker 1: but rim I'm watching fist of the North Star and I'm watching already finish that.

411
00:23:03,402 --> 00:23:04,446
Speaker 1: So I'm just way out of you.

412
00:23:04,547 --> 00:23:05,891
Speaker 1: So yeah, that's a problem.

413
00:23:05,932 --> 00:23:06,895
Speaker 0: I've been reading books.

414
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:08,059
Speaker 1: I also been reading books.

415
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:10,787
Speaker 1: You have also not been shit-talking.

416
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,734
Speaker 1: Do you just way behind on everything?

417
00:23:13,015 --> 00:23:14,220
Speaker 0: I've been actually working on shit.

418
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,232
Speaker 0: Talk to you quite a bit.

419
00:23:15,596 --> 00:23:17,970
Speaker 1: All right Well, we'll see when I will see when I see some shit.

420
00:23:18,372 --> 00:23:19,840
Speaker 0: cuz Pax was our last big thing.

421
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:26,420
Speaker 1: The next important thing we have to do is Pax When I see some when I see some poop, I'll believe that you're not shit talking.

422
00:23:27,321 --> 00:23:27,724
Speaker 1: There you go.

423
00:23:28,388 --> 00:23:28,730
Speaker 1: All right.

424
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:34,292
Speaker 1: So yeah, so I said hey Let's see Futurama's animation and we've never done a show about that.

425
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:36,340
Speaker 1: And you know what people probably really like a show on that.

426
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,387
Speaker 1: So let's do a show on that.

427
00:23:37,467 --> 00:23:38,393
Speaker 0: Wait, this opens the door.

428
00:23:38,454 --> 00:23:39,420
Speaker 0: We could do a show on the Simpsons.

429
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:41,906
Speaker 0: Yeah, we could do a show on South Park.

430
00:23:41,926 --> 00:23:42,589
Speaker 0: Why Futurama?

431
00:23:42,609 --> 00:23:44,134
Speaker 0: Why is Futurama different from the Simpsons?

432
00:23:44,415 --> 00:23:47,672
Speaker 0: They're both still going They're both wildly popular.

433
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:49,120
Speaker 0: They're both good.

434
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:54,900
Speaker 1: Well, I think the thing with Futurama is that it has so much more nerd cred and it's much more appropriate for geek nights.

435
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:07,660
Speaker 1: Cuz you know, first of all, it is all sci-fi II right and has a future spacey theme large numbers of surprisingly subtle physics Jokes, yeah, and you know, the Simpsons has jokes all over the place too like that, you know.

436
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,279
Speaker 1: And it has plenty of geek cred as well.

437
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:12,215
Speaker 1: You know, you're not gonna go in a comic store without seeing some Simpsons stuff.

438
00:24:12,255 --> 00:24:14,243
Speaker 1: You got Simpsons comics You got comic book guy.

439
00:24:14,725 --> 00:24:19,500
Speaker 1: There's plenty of nerd jokes, you know, Alan Moore was on the Simpsons and in a guest appearance, right?

440
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,879
Speaker 1: There's plenty of nerd cred going on there.

441
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,767
Speaker 1: But I think you know, the Futurama is just a little bit more nerdy And I think it's really nerds that are propping it up.

442
00:24:27,828 --> 00:24:28,791
Speaker 1: right because it came.

443
00:24:28,811 --> 00:24:31,340
Speaker 1: it didn't really get the TV ratings.

444
00:24:31,802 --> 00:24:35,200
Speaker 1: It went away, but then the nerds sort of kept it alive.

445
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,920
Speaker 0: It's one of the only times the nerds who wanted something to come back actually got what they wanted.

446
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,291
Speaker 0: I mean, how much did people lose their shit about Firefly?

447
00:24:42,692 --> 00:24:43,154
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

448
00:24:43,374 --> 00:24:45,100
Speaker 0: We got a fight to bring Firefly back.

449
00:24:45,341 --> 00:24:45,822
Speaker 0: It's gonna cut.

450
00:24:45,883 --> 00:24:46,826
Speaker 0: it's never coming back.

451
00:24:46,846 --> 00:24:55,100
Speaker 1: I Have a. There are a few loud fans.

452
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:03,486
Speaker 1: The number of fans isn't actually that large just seems larger than it is because there's a few loud ones and not only are they Loud but they're extra dedicated.

453
00:25:03,506 --> 00:25:04,350
Speaker 1: It's even an event.

454
00:25:04,632 --> 00:25:06,239
Speaker 1: They all show up and pack the house.

455
00:25:06,461 --> 00:25:08,439
Speaker 1: We have a service and you have a Simpsons event.

456
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:17,025
Speaker 1: There's got to be a hundred times more Simpsons fans than Firefly fans, but if you have an event those people who are Simpsons fans They just watch it every Sunday.

457
00:25:17,065 --> 00:25:17,326
Speaker 1: They don't.

458
00:25:17,547 --> 00:25:18,471
Speaker 1: it's not their lives.

459
00:25:18,772 --> 00:25:20,700
Speaker 1: You know, they don't live and breathe Simpsons.

460
00:25:20,821 --> 00:25:22,399
Speaker 1: There's only so many people who do that.

461
00:25:22,761 --> 00:25:29,940
Speaker 1: So they're not gonna show up in droves and scream on the internet if there's a Simpsons event or a Simpsons thing or whatever.

462
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:31,839
Speaker 1: You know, there's only some people who will do that.

463
00:25:32,182 --> 00:25:39,600
Speaker 0: So really I think wide future Alma's relevant is that you know The Simpsons is still going but I watched a whole bunch of episodes of it in the last few weeks.

464
00:25:40,182 --> 00:25:41,848
Speaker 0: It's really not that funny anymore at all.

465
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:48,339
Speaker 0: It's really kind of mainstream and kind of Mainstream and lame do not necessarily mean the same thing.

466
00:25:48,902 --> 00:25:54,306
Speaker 0: But the Simpsons is really just kind of these like obvious Ham-fisted pop-culture jokes.

467
00:25:54,747 --> 00:26:00,064
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that's the main thing is that when you do the pop-culture jokes, you know You're really sort of like.

468
00:26:00,646 --> 00:26:04,380
Speaker 1: it's not enjoyable to anyone who doesn't isn't a person who was in pop.

469
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,469
Speaker 0: I'll get old Simpsons like Willie, you know the shinning.

470
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,997
Speaker 0: that was mostly kind of timeless jokes.

471
00:26:10,017 --> 00:26:10,980
Speaker 0: You can watch the episode today.

472
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,699
Speaker 0: It's just as funny.

473
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,746
Speaker 1: Well, that's because it was.

474
00:26:12,826 --> 00:26:15,220
Speaker 1: it was still a pop-culture reference to the shinning.

475
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:21,360
Speaker 0: It was a pop-culture reference to what was itself a timeless thing exactly what I was about to say, you know.

476
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:29,920
Speaker 1: So if you make if you look at like old Looney Tunes Episodes right the ones that hold up are the ones that just have generic jokes like, you know, rabbit season duck season, right?

477
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,940
Speaker 1: But the ones that are like where they're impersonating famous people of the time like, you know, Jack Benny.

478
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:36,511
Speaker 0: I would argue that those still work.

479
00:26:36,632 --> 00:26:40,439
Speaker 1: for example they work But they don't work on people who don't know who those famous people were.

480
00:26:40,821 --> 00:26:48,487
Speaker 0: But the Groucho Marx ones definitely work because I think a lot of people think that that kind of character is Bugs Bunny and don't Realize that there was a Groucho Marx.

481
00:26:48,748 --> 00:26:50,235
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that that worries me.

482
00:26:50,596 --> 00:26:51,520
Speaker 0: or Rodney Dangerfield?

483
00:26:51,601 --> 00:26:54,319
Speaker 0: I think people think that is a character, but don't know Rodney Dangerfield is.

484
00:26:55,564 --> 00:26:58,408
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know the point is What's his name are?

485
00:26:58,489 --> 00:27:00,786
Speaker 1: Yes Peter Laurie.

486
00:27:00,867 --> 00:27:02,378
Speaker 0: Yeah, Peter Laurie or how about?

487
00:27:04,182 --> 00:27:04,904
Speaker 0: I don't know who that is.

488
00:27:04,924 --> 00:27:05,807
Speaker 0: You don't know that guy is.

489
00:27:05,867 --> 00:27:06,128
Speaker 0: Yeah.

490
00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:10,140
Speaker 0: He's the the hotel manager in the hotel broken arms.

491
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,716
Speaker 0: Fame is famous actor and voice actor.

492
00:27:12,736 --> 00:27:15,564
Speaker 0: All right I can't do it.

493
00:27:15,725 --> 00:27:22,670
Speaker 0: Okay voice is still kind of shot from packs, but future Amma is Mostly with the exception of that iPhone episode.

494
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:23,975
Speaker 0: They just did pretty timeless.

495
00:27:24,055 --> 00:27:25,300
Speaker 0: I think yeah.

496
00:27:25,721 --> 00:27:30,400
Speaker 1: And the other thing is that the characters are just so much, you know, like the the variety in there.

497
00:27:30,822 --> 00:27:37,410
Speaker 1: you got so much, you know, each one is more exaggerated and Has more shtick going on right?

498
00:27:37,772 --> 00:27:39,400
Speaker 1: Whereas the simp - whereas the Simpsons.

499
00:27:39,641 --> 00:27:45,460
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, they have just this huge cast right where each one does a little bit first notice how.

500
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,765
Speaker 0: that's a recent phenomenon.

501
00:27:47,107 --> 00:27:47,809
Speaker 0: the Simpsons had.

502
00:27:47,829 --> 00:27:49,516
Speaker 0: you know the core and they're all the urban.

503
00:27:49,536 --> 00:27:52,509
Speaker 0: look at the early eras of the Simpsons you basically define them by.

504
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,719
Speaker 0: was it about Bart or was it about Homer?

505
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:56,284
Speaker 0: and then you defined it by.

506
00:27:56,344 --> 00:27:58,876
Speaker 0: was it when Homer was stupid when he was evil when he was cunning?

507
00:27:58,936 --> 00:28:05,459
Speaker 0: all these eras of the Simpsons and Every now and then they give like Moe would have an episode and then they kind of ran out of stuff to do.

508
00:28:05,499 --> 00:28:07,900
Speaker 0: and I Feel like now like half the episodes are about Moe.

509
00:28:08,582 --> 00:28:10,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't even know anymore it's always Moe.

510
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,860
Speaker 1: but in future in Futurama they have core characters.

511
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:15,064
Speaker 1: They've brought a few in.

512
00:28:15,325 --> 00:28:19,760
Speaker 1: you know, like zap Brannigan became more important and I guess I love that brand the green.

513
00:28:19,862 --> 00:28:20,537
Speaker 1: What's the green guy?

514
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,229
Speaker 1: The alien kiff.

515
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:25,118
Speaker 1: Yeah, he became more important, right?

516
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:36,974
Speaker 1: But and you know, but other than that, you know, most of the characters who were side characters like, you know Nixon and scruffy and hedonism, but they maintain like the right level.

517
00:28:37,135 --> 00:28:38,740
Speaker 1: They maintain their sideness.

518
00:28:38,921 --> 00:28:41,605
Speaker 1: There isn't a hedonism bought episode But they're still strong.

519
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:44,520
Speaker 0: a hedonism bought episode would I think harken the end of future?

520
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,640
Speaker 1: I would be a shark jumpage even though he doesn't bust up.

521
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,298
Speaker 1: I love he doesn't buy but it would be a shark jump, but it's the same thing.

522
00:28:49,358 --> 00:28:53,858
Speaker 0: every Oh most his lack was my favorite character in the Simpsons just because of two knives.

523
00:28:54,078 --> 00:28:58,340
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Oh, yeah, but then now like there's a Moe episode and I just don't care.

524
00:28:58,841 --> 00:29:00,766
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is in Futurama.

525
00:29:00,847 --> 00:29:09,789
Speaker 1: every episode what focus is usually on one of the core characters is oidberg or Amy right or fry or something like that.

526
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:14,226
Speaker 1: and then the other characters all the main ones are all in there Constantly, you know.

527
00:29:14,548 --> 00:29:15,955
Speaker 1: and the side characters they all.

528
00:29:15,975 --> 00:29:16,920
Speaker 1: they remain side.

529
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,539
Speaker 1: They'll show up for like one second in the episode and be gone.

530
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:22,851
Speaker 0: I've I've noticed something to the kind of talking about like and they can keep.

531
00:29:22,871 --> 00:29:28,432
Speaker 1: they can keep cranking the episodes and they still work Even though they're keeping the focus on the main crew.

532
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:29,637
Speaker 0: think about nerd culture.

533
00:29:29,677 --> 00:29:36,209
Speaker 0: when you were in high school You know back when the Simpsons was still, you know The old kind of Simpsons and even early college People would collect Simpsons.

534
00:29:36,269 --> 00:29:38,121
Speaker 0: quoting was kind of like the nerd thing to do Like.

535
00:29:38,141 --> 00:29:41,796
Speaker 0: you'd always make the Simpsons reference in concert conversation.

536
00:29:41,816 --> 00:29:42,438
Speaker 0: It would just come up.

537
00:29:43,321 --> 00:29:45,749
Speaker 0: You mostly hear the Futurama references around nerds.

538
00:29:45,769 --> 00:29:48,920
Speaker 0: You don't hear that many Simpsons references and if you do it's always old Simpsons.

539
00:29:49,448 --> 00:29:50,019
Speaker 0: Mmm, that's true.

540
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:52,471
Speaker 0: I feel like Futurama is the mantle of like.

541
00:29:52,853 --> 00:30:01,705
Speaker 0: that is the nerd cartoon And I guess the only other cartoon as he referenced a lot are like Venture Brothers or Archer South Park.

542
00:30:02,127 --> 00:30:03,191
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

543
00:30:03,392 --> 00:30:12,757
Speaker 0: plus name the good popular Cartoons that are on TV or were recently on TV in America that weren't animes.

544
00:30:13,118 --> 00:30:13,720
Speaker 0: there were an anime.

545
00:30:13,781 --> 00:30:17,505
Speaker 0: There's an animation cartoons Futurama South Park.

546
00:30:17,686 --> 00:30:20,336
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I would argue Archer you didn't watch Archer.

547
00:30:20,376 --> 00:30:22,343
Speaker 0: but Archer is fucking hilarious Whatever.

548
00:30:22,644 --> 00:30:26,478
Speaker 0: and I think a lot of people are quoting Archer and you just don't notice because you don't you didn't watch it.

549
00:30:27,301 --> 00:30:38,460
Speaker 1: It is very likely that many people quote things and I have no idea that they're quoting something because I did not watch the thing That they're quoting much like someone watching a non timeless Simpsons episode with pop culture references.

550
00:30:38,601 --> 00:30:40,329
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Simpsons kind of went the Shrek route.

551
00:30:40,369 --> 00:30:41,253
Speaker 0: I mean Shrek was.

552
00:30:41,615 --> 00:30:42,740
Speaker 0: it's all just pop culture.

553
00:30:42,821 --> 00:30:44,493
Speaker 0: That won't make any sense ten years from now.

554
00:30:44,836 --> 00:30:50,019
Speaker 0: Yep Of course, I worry that there's going to be a day when no one knows what the Shannon was.

555
00:30:51,504 --> 00:30:53,077
Speaker 1: There are people already who don't know what the shitting is.

556
00:30:53,158 --> 00:31:02,454
Speaker 0: I know I mean the fact that we'll go to an anime con and we're like how many people haven't seen cowboy bebop like half the crowd Raised their hands and then we're like how many people haven't seen Star Wars.

557
00:31:02,495 --> 00:31:03,980
Speaker 0: about half the crowd raised their hands.

558
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:05,770
Speaker 1: There were people who raised their hand.

559
00:31:06,051 --> 00:31:06,594
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they were.

560
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:10,971
Speaker 0: there are many gasps But there'll be a day when the gasps is.

561
00:31:10,992 --> 00:31:14,171
Speaker 0: you've seen Star Wars Which I mean look at this.

562
00:31:14,596 --> 00:31:20,897
Speaker 0: every Pax we have been to has the focal point of the keynote not been Star Wars changed everything.

563
00:31:21,158 --> 00:31:28,874
Speaker 1: every single Pax keynote speaker always Mentions and makes a big deal out of how Star Wars changed everything in their lives.

564
00:31:28,974 --> 00:31:34,615
Speaker 0: anime to every anime director We ever see in person is like yeah Star Wars fucking changed everything for me.

565
00:31:34,635 --> 00:31:36,020
Speaker 1: But meanwhile, right?

566
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,753
Speaker 1: It's so disappointing at George Lucas is a piece of shit right now.

567
00:31:39,813 --> 00:31:40,415
Speaker 0: No, he's not.

568
00:31:40,435 --> 00:31:42,743
Speaker 0: you know, what happened there Means a sad story.

569
00:31:43,065 --> 00:31:47,200
Speaker 0: He was a great director and then his neck killed him and continued making movies.

570
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,496
Speaker 1: The thing is he didn't even direct Empire Strikes Back Jedi.

571
00:31:51,963 --> 00:31:53,740
Speaker 1: He gets all this credit mean, you know.

572
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,680
Speaker 0: Well, it's kind of like M Night Shyamalan who unfortunately died before he can make the Avatar movie.

573
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,567
Speaker 0: I was looking forward to.

574
00:31:58,748 --> 00:32:06,964
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, you know, it's like The like who you know every other awesome Thing that is huge.

575
00:32:06,984 --> 00:32:07,847
Speaker 0: Well, look at the difference.

576
00:32:07,867 --> 00:32:09,172
Speaker 1: The person is also awesome.

577
00:32:09,212 --> 00:32:10,315
Speaker 0: Here's a big contrast.

578
00:32:10,576 --> 00:32:11,580
Speaker 0: So we've got Lucas, right?

579
00:32:11,981 --> 00:32:19,163
Speaker 0: There was a happy accident that all the people around him were amazingly competent and this awesome work came out and he's kind of a mediocre You know director.

580
00:32:19,183 --> 00:32:24,157
Speaker 0: all things considered meanwhile, I look at Soshi Khan who wrote and directed like everything.

581
00:32:24,538 --> 00:32:30,837
Speaker 1: Yep Yeah Anyway, why couldn't they take Lucas's thing?

582
00:32:33,421 --> 00:32:36,956
Speaker 0: Anymore so Futurama is just kind of poor nerds.

583
00:32:37,097 --> 00:32:37,800
Speaker 0: This is our show.

584
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,744
Speaker 0: This is what we've got.

585
00:32:38,885 --> 00:32:40,693
Speaker 0: and also look at Family Guy.

586
00:32:40,733 --> 00:32:44,715
Speaker 0: Family Guy was super popular Died and the nerds got what they wanted.

587
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:45,239
Speaker 0: it came back.

588
00:32:45,561 --> 00:32:52,973
Speaker 0: Remember that first episode when it came back when they brought back Ollie Williams with the Blackie weather forecast And we knew that they knew what made the show funny.

589
00:32:52,993 --> 00:32:54,280
Speaker 0: and then they never did that again.

590
00:32:54,841 --> 00:32:57,288
Speaker 0: And the show is just self-referential crap and pop culture.

591
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:57,870
Speaker 0: Hmm.

592
00:32:58,572 --> 00:33:01,260
Speaker 0: It's very rare that a show comes back and maintains goodness.

593
00:33:01,783 --> 00:33:02,789
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is very rare.

594
00:33:02,809 --> 00:33:04,700
Speaker 1: I mean the thing is I will not lie.

595
00:33:05,062 --> 00:33:13,414
Speaker 1: Personally think that the Futurama comeback was a you know It was a decline in quality But it was not so much of a decline as to no longer be good.

596
00:33:13,454 --> 00:33:16,579
Speaker 1: it like went from like 10 To like eight and a half, you know.

597
00:33:16,841 --> 00:33:21,980
Speaker 0: I would argue that most of the decline was in the interim movies because they were good but because they were long.

598
00:33:22,221 --> 00:33:24,649
Speaker 0: That was yeah, that was so tried to plot way too much.

599
00:33:24,709 --> 00:33:26,174
Speaker 0: and Futurama is not about plot.

600
00:33:26,535 --> 00:33:28,020
Speaker 0: It is about Azusa.

601
00:33:28,502 --> 00:33:30,652
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was sort of the slope downwards, right?

602
00:33:30,692 --> 00:33:35,279
Speaker 1: It's like the movies were all okay But like the Beast of the Billion Backs that was way too long.

603
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:42,162
Speaker 1: I really like the the one with the the fantasy one the best although vendors game was okay But it had.

604
00:33:42,183 --> 00:33:45,058
Speaker 0: it had some really kind of crap moments near the end.

605
00:33:45,761 --> 00:33:51,580
Speaker 0: It was kind of dumb, but it did individual jokes in that one made me laugh so hard that I almost peed.

606
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:56,931
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's why I like it the best cuz it's all about the actual jokes, you know I mean that was the episode.

607
00:33:56,971 --> 00:33:57,900
Speaker 0: that was the one we watched.

608
00:33:58,021 --> 00:34:11,518
Speaker 0: Maybe might have just been because it was late But it was the whole front row crew like laying all on top of each other's big pile on that old-ass TV late at night after like a burning wheel game And he made that Hobbit joke and we laughed for like 20 minutes and couldn't stop and I couldn't breathe.

609
00:34:11,819 --> 00:34:13,167
Speaker 0: Yep That was the same night.

610
00:34:13,206 --> 00:34:14,234
Speaker 0: We watched Hypno Toad.

611
00:34:14,556 --> 00:34:17,649
Speaker 1: Yep But yeah, it's like, you know the movies.

612
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:21,324
Speaker 1: they were alright and some of them were better than others But it's sort of like now.

613
00:34:21,364 --> 00:34:21,985
Speaker 1: they started this.

614
00:34:22,045 --> 00:34:22,588
Speaker 1: these.

615
00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:29,989
Speaker 1: I guess it's technically the 60s season because they're calling the movies the fifth season right and All the episodes in the current season.

616
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:31,175
Speaker 1: I've watched most of them.

617
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:37,719
Speaker 1: there might be one or two new ones I haven't watched but I've watched all the ones up, you know quite a few and the quality is pretty steady.

618
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,946
Speaker 1: All the episodes are equal.

619
00:34:39,266 --> 00:34:41,900
Speaker 1: They're all funny, but none of them are oh my god funny.

620
00:34:42,362 --> 00:34:44,560
Speaker 1: They're not like memorable for all time funny.

621
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,313
Speaker 1: They're just really good and worth watching.

622
00:34:47,474 --> 00:34:48,699
Speaker 1: kind of funny, you know.

623
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:55,899
Speaker 1: Whereas I feel that the episodes from before right some of the older ones are all time funny, you know.

624
00:34:56,926 --> 00:34:57,752
Speaker 1: But that's how it goes.

625
00:34:57,853 --> 00:35:00,257
Speaker 1: it's better to have you know Some good stuff than to have no stuff.

626
00:35:00,861 --> 00:35:05,376
Speaker 1: Of course and especially in the absence of South Park where it also kind of treads this line between.

627
00:35:05,397 --> 00:35:10,561
Speaker 0: it is mostly comedy But there is kind of a plot and you do care about the characters like.

628
00:35:10,581 --> 00:35:18,577
Speaker 0: there is good writing a good story and you really like you are sympathetic and this is a show that makes a lot of people cry and it's very emotional sometimes.

629
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:20,924
Speaker 0: the Dog episode.

630
00:35:20,944 --> 00:35:21,467
Speaker 0: Yeah.

631
00:35:21,527 --> 00:35:32,960
Speaker 1: I mean that is one thing that Futurama has family Right that South Park Simpsons Family Guy none of the other shows have and I think this is why nerds dig a little bit more.

632
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,872
Speaker 1: Is that it actually has this mild continuity?

633
00:35:35,972 --> 00:35:40,648
Speaker 1: It's like any episode is episodic You can just watch it but sort of like cowboy bebop, right?

634
00:35:41,029 --> 00:35:51,220
Speaker 1: Some episodes are continuity episodes, you know and They they go with each other and the characters actually sort of kind of change a little bit over time.

635
00:35:51,401 --> 00:36:01,355
Speaker 1: Personalities don't change their sticks don't change, you know bender still steals and is a jerk and you know You know, I noticed a claptrap in Borderlands is bender who's not a jerk.

636
00:36:01,475 --> 00:36:03,888
Speaker 0: I've decided that's right Cuz that's all he is he's bender.

637
00:36:03,988 --> 00:36:05,660
Speaker 0: bender was just not a complete asshole.

638
00:36:06,043 --> 00:36:09,215
Speaker 1: Yeah, but yeah, I gotta finish that game But the yeah.

639
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:25,006
Speaker 1: but you have these characters that continue over time with a mild continuity to it and there's actually some development and Because of that they can actually Make a thing where you care about the characters based on their history Whereas like the Simpsons can't really do that.

640
00:36:25,026 --> 00:36:35,140
Speaker 1: They might be able to make an episode where the story of that single episode is Sad or you know has some sort of you know emotional message as opposed to just pure comedy.

641
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:41,280
Speaker 1: But the characters can't change but they can't do it based on the main characters or anything like that.

642
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:49,300
Speaker 1: It has to be like oh my god You know Lisa Simpson met a really sad person and we learn about the sad person I get this in a recent episode.

643
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,788
Speaker 0: They gave Bart a girlfriend.

644
00:36:51,089 --> 00:36:52,477
Speaker 0: Oh, man, and that didn't continue.

645
00:36:52,517 --> 00:36:54,786
Speaker 0: in the next episode The character just gone as far as I can tell.

646
00:36:54,986 --> 00:36:57,214
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, but it ended with like they're totally dating.

647
00:36:57,234 --> 00:36:58,037
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

648
00:36:58,077 --> 00:37:01,489
Speaker 1: Yeah And how'd you know that?

649
00:37:01,851 --> 00:37:05,085
Speaker 0: cuz I watched it whoa And I was reminded of her.

650
00:37:05,105 --> 00:37:08,759
Speaker 0: remember we had the private West Coast front row crew after party at PAX.

651
00:37:09,121 --> 00:37:12,380
Speaker 0: Yep, that episode was on the screen in the background where we were hanging out.

652
00:37:12,701 --> 00:37:14,167
Speaker 1: No, I barely looked at it.

653
00:37:14,187 --> 00:37:17,700
Speaker 1: I just I just sort of glanced and I was like, oh Simpsons and I didn't really watch the episode.

654
00:37:17,782 --> 00:37:20,820
Speaker 1: I didn't watch it either Subtitle so it wouldn't have mattered.

655
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,126
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's that episode plus.

656
00:37:22,146 --> 00:37:23,151
Speaker 0: we were too busy hanging out with.

657
00:37:23,311 --> 00:37:25,923
Speaker 0: uh, Aaron Clark packs, Aaron Clark Not Otakon.

658
00:37:25,983 --> 00:37:29,760
Speaker 1: Aaron Clark good Aaron Clark not as evil twin from the east.

659
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,399
Speaker 1: You got to make that clear, but I don't know if he's a twin not even close.

660
00:37:35,389 --> 00:37:42,380
Speaker 1: The Divergence of the level of awesomeness is so great It's like hard to imagine that both the people have the same name.

661
00:37:42,521 --> 00:37:43,709
Speaker 0: Wow, that was the side.

662
00:37:43,749 --> 00:37:45,260
Speaker 1: They have nothing else in common.

663
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:50,297
Speaker 0: You realize that was simultaneously a shout-out and what I can only call a reverse shout-out.

664
00:37:50,558 --> 00:37:54,378
Speaker 0: Oh shit Luckily, I don't think the bad Aaron Clark actually listens to our show.

665
00:37:55,602 --> 00:37:57,748
Speaker 1: If he did it would make him less crappy.

666
00:37:57,808 --> 00:38:01,298
Speaker 0: there everyone whose name is Aaron Clark email us.

667
00:38:01,338 --> 00:38:02,020
Speaker 0: Let us know you listen.

668
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:02,947
Speaker 1: Let's get the phone book.

669
00:38:02,988 --> 00:38:04,480
Speaker 1: There's plenty of Aaron Clark's in the phone.

670
00:38:06,002 --> 00:38:06,869
Speaker 1: There's no shortage.

671
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:12,268
Speaker 1: I At least ten in any phone book Any US phone book.

672
00:38:13,421 --> 00:38:14,648
Speaker 0: I just can't help but think back to.

673
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:26,320
Speaker 0: we were having some argument at the shore about like information being free and your argument was basically the phone book never killed anyone and I think my Rebuttal and proof that you were wrong was Sarah Connor.

674
00:38:29,201 --> 00:38:32,472
Speaker 0: Anyway Sarah Connor lived the other like seven.

675
00:38:32,512 --> 00:38:33,455
Speaker 0: Sarah Connors didn't.

676
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:34,800
Speaker 1: that's their problem.

677
00:38:36,486 --> 00:38:39,020
Speaker 0: so Futurama It's awesome.

678
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,990
Speaker 0: Yeah It's hard to review things that we like.

679
00:38:43,331 --> 00:38:45,380
Speaker 1: What's what's some of your favorite?

680
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,494
Speaker 0: Episode that's such a crap.

681
00:38:48,514 --> 00:38:49,179
Speaker 0: cop-out.

682
00:38:49,803 --> 00:38:52,640
Speaker 1: What about that makes them your favorite episodes again?

683
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:56,860
Speaker 0: So my favorite episode straight up is the gargoyle one because it has the old jokes.

684
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:03,440
Speaker 0: I'm stealing my favorite episode as the old jokes and the gargoyle and then just and now a little one is that is how pop?

685
00:39:03,881 --> 00:39:04,323
Speaker 0: Freedom.

686
00:39:04,403 --> 00:39:05,767
Speaker 1: that is how papa gets freedom.

687
00:39:06,228 --> 00:39:09,639
Speaker 0: now born we born we tell you are born to me.

688
00:39:10,704 --> 00:39:11,146
Speaker 0: That was hmm.

689
00:39:11,427 --> 00:39:12,051
Speaker 0: I don't know.

690
00:39:12,071 --> 00:39:13,840
Speaker 0: There's something about that episode.

691
00:39:15,002 --> 00:39:22,954
Speaker 1: Well, it's because it's like they all fall in like the time goop and they're like There are so many like concise quotable memes in it.

692
00:39:23,215 --> 00:39:26,938
Speaker 1: My what my Get a job got a job.

693
00:39:26,958 --> 00:39:29,387
Speaker 1: I forgot Was in the same episode.

694
00:39:29,427 --> 00:39:29,970
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

695
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:30,553
Speaker 1: I don't know.

696
00:39:30,613 --> 00:39:31,940
Speaker 1: that was also an excellent episode.

697
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,799
Speaker 1: Time traveling boxes and they get a job.

698
00:39:36,442 --> 00:39:36,985
Speaker 1: That's a good one.

699
00:39:37,206 --> 00:39:38,533
Speaker 0: That wasn't time traveling boxes.

700
00:39:38,553 --> 00:39:39,700
Speaker 0: That was universes in boxes.

701
00:39:39,921 --> 00:39:41,291
Speaker 1: All right universe is in the boxes.

702
00:39:41,614 --> 00:39:42,360
Speaker 0: kind of inception.

703
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:42,881
Speaker 1: They're all.

704
00:39:42,902 --> 00:39:44,005
Speaker 1: they all feel the same way.

705
00:39:44,045 --> 00:39:48,620
Speaker 1: like a time travel episode a universe switching episode a space travel planet switching episode.

706
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,807
Speaker 1: They don't feel they don't feel like the same thing.

707
00:39:50,827 --> 00:39:52,472
Speaker 0: They didn't actually travel through time.

708
00:39:52,513 --> 00:39:54,037
Speaker 0: They just started going.

709
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:54,820
Speaker 0: they started merlin.

710
00:39:54,901 --> 00:39:58,685
Speaker 1: yeah, the time travel episode was the Fry.

711
00:39:58,725 --> 00:39:59,228
Speaker 1: does the grant?

712
00:39:59,248 --> 00:40:00,535
Speaker 1: does the grandma episode?

713
00:40:00,656 --> 00:40:00,977
Speaker 0: Yes.

714
00:40:01,138 --> 00:40:15,918
Speaker 1: Yeah But that would the time travel time shifting of bodies and world boxes for three different episodes you realize yeah It's also I think that sometimes there are self-referential jokes in Futurama Like though like they'll insult fry for getting with his grandma or something like that.

715
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:18,779
Speaker 1: But all right, so I remember they trying to them doing that.

716
00:40:19,101 --> 00:40:19,542
Speaker 1: But it's not.

717
00:40:19,602 --> 00:40:20,023
Speaker 1: it's not like.

718
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:31,640
Speaker 1: it's different to reference your own continuity to make a joke that it is to Sort of just retell the same joke over and over again like just Ali Williams is there.

719
00:40:31,881 --> 00:40:35,351
Speaker 0: I think it's only a matter of artistry because you can do both.

720
00:40:35,452 --> 00:40:39,094
Speaker 0: venture brothers and Archer did the self-referential thing I think the right way.

721
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,208
Speaker 0: Futurama does it in like a plotty way.

722
00:40:42,228 --> 00:40:42,950
Speaker 0: That's also good.

723
00:40:43,653 --> 00:40:46,989
Speaker 0: and say family guy at first They made the self-referential.

724
00:40:47,049 --> 00:40:48,318
Speaker 0: that was kind of the meta like.

725
00:40:48,378 --> 00:40:51,519
Speaker 0: haha We know that you like to this character and his one joke.

726
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:55,714
Speaker 0: But then they just kind of keep using like these meta jokes like that chick.

727
00:40:55,734 --> 00:40:57,540
Speaker 0: it was fucking come out of nowhere and attack Peters.

728
00:40:57,661 --> 00:40:58,244
Speaker 0: Like all right.

729
00:40:58,264 --> 00:41:00,696
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like think about this Ollie Williams from Family Guy, right?

730
00:41:00,756 --> 00:41:01,440
Speaker 1: Why is he funny?

731
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:07,166
Speaker 1: He's funny because it came out of no, it's funny because it came out of nowhere and because he says it in a funny way It's gonna rain.

732
00:41:07,186 --> 00:41:08,014
Speaker 1: It's gonna rain, right?

733
00:41:08,094 --> 00:41:10,024
Speaker 1: It's a Physicality of it.

734
00:41:10,064 --> 00:41:11,474
Speaker 1: the sound of it is funny.

735
00:41:11,514 --> 00:41:13,022
Speaker 1: It's just a funny sound It's no.

736
00:41:13,344 --> 00:41:17,560
Speaker 1: it's funny for the same reason that getting hit with a pie in the face is funny because it looks funny, right?

737
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:17,761
Speaker 1: It's.

738
00:41:18,325 --> 00:41:20,620
Speaker 1: it's just hilarious to look at and out of the ordinary.

739
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,352
Speaker 0: So if you're just gonna reference it straight you do it again.

740
00:41:23,855 --> 00:41:26,891
Speaker 1: It's not it's only funny It's not actually funny to just for him.

741
00:41:26,932 --> 00:41:28,260
Speaker 1: Just just keep saying it's gonna rain.

742
00:41:29,222 --> 00:41:41,233
Speaker 0: Look doing the same the exact same joke or the same style of joke one more time Later is also funny cuz that you know, a lot of comedians do that, but it's funny because hey Hey, I'm reminded of the funny joke from a second ago.

743
00:41:41,253 --> 00:41:42,279
Speaker 1: That's not an old joke.

744
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:45,292
Speaker 0: yet You can't do it the third time unless you do the comedian thing.

745
00:41:45,332 --> 00:41:51,540
Speaker 0: where you do it once do it twice Don't do it for a long time and then bring it all back to that at the end.

746
00:41:51,721 --> 00:41:56,330
Speaker 1: But you can't do that across multiple episodes Oh and again within a single episode.

747
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:59,525
Speaker 1: right if you do it across multiple episodes That doesn't work.

748
00:41:59,706 --> 00:42:01,680
Speaker 0: but like look at Archer and Venture Brothers.

749
00:42:01,801 --> 00:42:07,975
Speaker 0: This is where you can do the sort of self-referential Comedy in the right way because then it's more of a character development thing.

750
00:42:07,995 --> 00:42:09,683
Speaker 0: Like you're getting to know the character That's what future.

751
00:42:09,724 --> 00:42:10,186
Speaker 1: I'm ahead.

752
00:42:10,267 --> 00:42:12,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the other ones like an archer they have this thing.

753
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:19,690
Speaker 0: We're like in one of the early episodes like someone's like that's how you get ants and the other characters like hey yep, and they said like a yep kind of a like front row crew.

754
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,513
Speaker 0: we have stuff like that.

755
00:42:20,854 --> 00:42:24,346
Speaker 0: we say things in certain ways and That yep.

756
00:42:24,849 --> 00:42:32,860
Speaker 0: Nope kind of Characters do that to each other the way friends do throughout the entire show and then it becomes kind of this meta joke later.

757
00:42:33,502 --> 00:42:34,828
Speaker 0: Mmm, that's the right way to do it.

758
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,898
Speaker 0: Not just having the chicken suit come out.

759
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:40,319
Speaker 0: Yell It's going to rain while a deaf guy runs by all greased up.

760
00:42:41,321 --> 00:42:42,706
Speaker 0: Yeah, family guy's not funny anymore.

761
00:42:42,766 --> 00:42:44,211
Speaker 1: Here's it is another example, right?

762
00:42:44,231 --> 00:42:46,920
Speaker 1: So Bender has his bite my shiny metal ass, right?

763
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:49,548
Speaker 0: Remember when he didn't have his shiny metal ass?

764
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:51,192
Speaker 1: that is that is very similar.

765
00:42:51,313 --> 00:42:53,760
Speaker 0: bite my majestic golden ass to benders.

766
00:42:54,285 --> 00:42:54,789
Speaker 1: To Bart's.

767
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:55,859
Speaker 1: eat my shorts, right?

768
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,705
Speaker 1: But bender I mean Bart.

769
00:42:57,785 --> 00:43:01,920
Speaker 1: he stopped at the heat my shorts and the I Caramba and such and don't have a cow man.

770
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:02,362
Speaker 1: Why?

771
00:43:02,382 --> 00:43:08,679
Speaker 1: he only really said those things once and they were only Memorable slogans because people put them on t-shirts and shit, right?

772
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:09,883
Speaker 0: Think of this back then.

773
00:43:09,903 --> 00:43:12,433
Speaker 0: this is just kind of unrelated food for thought.

774
00:43:12,513 --> 00:43:14,280
Speaker 0: back then in the eat my shorts.

775
00:43:14,401 --> 00:43:15,792
Speaker 0: I Caramba era of the Simpsons.

776
00:43:15,812 --> 00:43:19,460
Speaker 0: I Cedar Point had to turn my I Caramba shirt inside out.

777
00:43:20,162 --> 00:43:22,711
Speaker 0: They wouldn't let me into the park because it was bad.

778
00:43:22,731 --> 00:43:24,918
Speaker 1: and what's bad about I Caramba?

779
00:43:24,958 --> 00:43:28,471
Speaker 0: back then Parents would not let kids watch the fucking Simpsons.

780
00:43:28,732 --> 00:43:31,060
Speaker 0: the Simpsons was the controversial show.

781
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:35,235
Speaker 1: But by my shining metal ass is better than I could look how far societies come.

782
00:43:35,616 --> 00:43:36,720
Speaker 1: we've come a long way.

783
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:44,573
Speaker 1: Yeah, we have but anyway the yeah, so That those jokes, you know, they really only told them once in the Simpsons.

784
00:43:44,673 --> 00:43:45,717
Speaker 1: They couldn't really do.

785
00:43:45,857 --> 00:43:48,027
Speaker 1: use them again You know to great effect.

786
00:43:48,047 --> 00:43:48,952
Speaker 1: They were basically just.

787
00:43:48,972 --> 00:43:50,219
Speaker 1: they just fell flat recently.

788
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:54,420
Speaker 0: They did a few eat my shorts jokes, but the thing is a bender.

789
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:57,894
Speaker 0: They were a hundred percent meta, but you can do bite my shine in my last.

790
00:43:57,934 --> 00:43:59,560
Speaker 1: but he doesn't just say it, right?

791
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:02,611
Speaker 1: They remix it each time they have learned from the internet.

792
00:44:02,953 --> 00:44:04,037
Speaker 1: So instead of it.

793
00:44:04,137 --> 00:44:10,540
Speaker 1: He will buy my Golden, and he only said like bite my shiny metal ass like a few times, you know.

794
00:44:10,641 --> 00:44:16,840
Speaker 1: And every other time he said it It was always a remix like he was wooden once and he would be like bite my splinter.

795
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,783
Speaker 1: He wouldn't ass.

796
00:44:17,944 --> 00:44:24,386
Speaker 1: or one time like his ass fell off or something and he was like, oh no bite No, he sold it to the devil.

797
00:44:24,406 --> 00:44:25,350
Speaker 0: No, right.

798
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:27,158
Speaker 1: He sold sold his ass to the devil.

799
00:44:27,298 --> 00:44:32,479
Speaker 1: Yeah You know, so they mix it up if they want to reuse it, you know.

800
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:42,763
Speaker 1: I mean if Bart actually did stuff with his shorts, you know or found interest they could have kept that going But they were not as clever and because they didn't have the continuity Right.

801
00:44:43,145 --> 00:44:49,315
Speaker 1: Hey, that was really a flop if they would have tried to do that at all And there was no way they could have kept it going for that many years.

802
00:44:49,435 --> 00:44:53,704
Speaker 1: cuz you know Simpsons did it Except Simpsons did.

803
00:44:53,744 --> 00:44:55,430
Speaker 0: it is almost a South Park at this point.

804
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:56,634
Speaker 1: It is indeed a South Park.

805
00:44:57,457 --> 00:45:00,545
Speaker 1: It is indeed All right, is there anything else to say here?

806
00:45:00,565 --> 00:45:08,723
Speaker 0: Uh, the only thing I really want to say is that Futurama started in In 1999.

807
00:45:08,723 --> 00:45:10,148
Speaker 1: I know how fucked up is that right?

808
00:45:10,168 --> 00:45:12,296
Speaker 0: She's like 12 years ago.

809
00:45:12,316 --> 00:45:13,500
Speaker 1: It went for four years.

810
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:24,024
Speaker 1: so in oh three it ended years ago ended in oh three and the movies came out when uh, 2003?

811
00:45:24,024 --> 00:45:25,553
Speaker 1: well, no, that's when the TV show ended.

812
00:45:25,593 --> 00:45:26,820
Speaker 1: So when did the first movie come out?

813
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:30,913
Speaker 1: 2008. so there are five years of no Futurama.

814
00:45:30,933 --> 00:45:32,380
Speaker 1: That's a fucking long time.

815
00:45:33,143 --> 00:45:37,538
Speaker 0: So, uh, Team Fortress 2 was what like nine years ten years in the making.

816
00:45:37,558 --> 00:45:38,702
Speaker 0: and then holy shit It came out.

817
00:45:39,063 --> 00:45:41,210
Speaker 0: Duke Nukem forever even fucking came out.

818
00:45:41,431 --> 00:45:41,792
Speaker 1: It did it.

819
00:45:42,595 --> 00:45:44,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not in the stores yet.

820
00:45:44,582 --> 00:45:45,284
Speaker 0: I played it.

821
00:45:45,404 --> 00:45:45,846
Speaker 0: you played it.

822
00:45:45,886 --> 00:45:46,789
Speaker 1: you played a demo.

823
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:47,733
Speaker 1: there were demos before.

824
00:45:47,893 --> 00:45:50,645
Speaker 0: I fucking played Duke Nukem forever John St.

825
00:45:50,685 --> 00:45:50,907
Speaker 0: John.

826
00:45:50,947 --> 00:45:53,180
Speaker 0: the voice of Duke Nukem took me into the back room.

827
00:45:53,481 --> 00:46:02,220
Speaker 1: I fucking played a fuck you with his balls of steel and then a booth babe gave me a tank top Tank top to cover up after.

828
00:46:06,261 --> 00:46:09,394
Speaker 1: The thing is that just because you could have played it just a demo there was.

829
00:46:09,515 --> 00:46:10,720
Speaker 1: that was not the full game.

830
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,603
Speaker 1: It is not in the store.

831
00:46:11,623 --> 00:46:12,205
Speaker 1: We do not know.

832
00:46:12,607 --> 00:46:30,220
Speaker 0: So I think the real notable thing about Futurama is that Nerds always demand shit and sometimes like in the situation of tribes - you've got to ignore those nerds and not fuck up your game Mmm, and sometimes the situation of Family Guy, you've got to understand what made your show great in the first place.

833
00:46:30,751 --> 00:46:41,120
Speaker 0: I mean, you know We did a whole panel of packs where we talked about like Actraiser this video game and it had the overworld map thing That was cool and had this shitty side-scroller kind of tacked on and the game was super popular.

834
00:46:41,643 --> 00:46:43,092
Speaker 0: So the people who made it were like, you know what?

835
00:46:43,595 --> 00:46:44,360
Speaker 0: Let's make a sequel.

836
00:46:44,723 --> 00:46:46,557
Speaker 0: Nobody cared about that cool overworld part.

837
00:46:46,638 --> 00:46:49,288
Speaker 0: clearly What made this game awesome was that shitty side-scroller.

838
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:52,580
Speaker 0: make a sequel just shitty side-scroller.

839
00:46:53,242 --> 00:46:57,754
Speaker 0: Yeah, I feel like Family Guy when it came back did that they they're like what made the show popular.

840
00:46:58,296 --> 00:46:59,780
Speaker 0: stupid self-referential humor.

841
00:46:59,902 --> 00:47:00,878
Speaker 0: Let's just go with that.

842
00:47:01,602 --> 00:47:05,036
Speaker 1: They were lazy and it worked, you know, I mean, that's the one thing.

843
00:47:05,056 --> 00:47:06,160
Speaker 1: look at South Park, right?

844
00:47:06,481 --> 00:47:07,760
Speaker 1: They started off with poop jokes.

845
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,267
Speaker 1: It seems like all the shows start with food.

846
00:47:09,288 --> 00:47:11,679
Speaker 0: scarily enough watching some South Park again.

847
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:16,340
Speaker 0: The poop joke era lasted like a few episodes in the first season.

848
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:21,318
Speaker 0: They got into social commentary like actual social commentary and jokes that weren't just.

849
00:47:21,398 --> 00:47:23,829
Speaker 0: oh my god Those kids are swearing pretty fucking quick.

850
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:33,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's it's like a difficulty curve in a video game You start with low difficulty you get with the low brow and then you raise the brow with a nice difficult You know challenge curve, you know, you got.

851
00:47:34,032 --> 00:47:35,640
Speaker 1: the show gets progressively more difficult.

852
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:40,716
Speaker 0: I mean South Park today is I think some of the better popular social commentary television out there.

853
00:47:41,298 --> 00:47:41,839
Speaker 1: Maybe the best.

854
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:46,030
Speaker 1: But you know the some of these other shows like Family Guy.

855
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:47,615
Speaker 1: they lowered the brow.

856
00:47:47,756 --> 00:47:48,940
Speaker 1: They didn't raise the brow.

857
00:47:49,301 --> 00:47:51,884
Speaker 0: Family Guy is not saying anything about society.

858
00:47:52,065 --> 00:47:52,706
Speaker 1: Not really.

859
00:47:52,766 --> 00:47:57,966
Speaker 1: No, you know, the Simpsons does sometimes and Futurama does every.

860
00:47:58,026 --> 00:48:00,074
Speaker 0: it says such a milquetoast things nowadays.

861
00:48:00,094 --> 00:48:04,332
Speaker 1: Futurama does sometimes Kinda, but that's about it.

862
00:48:04,775 --> 00:48:06,904
Speaker 1: It's all good All right.

863
00:48:07,306 --> 00:48:19,819
Speaker 0: I think Futurama social commentary is more taking Everything that it like every trend in our current world and just driving them out to the extreme Exaggeration of what if this course continues that long?

864
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:22,520
Speaker 0: Mmm, and in that way, it's weird I'll.

865
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:32,940
Speaker 0: Futurama is incredibly like over-the-top and inaccurate and yet in many ways very like Spiritually accurate to what our society is like if you take it to the extreme in every direction at once.

866
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:36,779
Speaker 1: I guess that really applies to its theme of future Futurama, right?

867
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:48,763
Speaker 1: You know you take something that we have currently and you extract it through the future And you you know, I mean you look at have all like the famous people of current time with their heads are in a jar And stuff like that.

868
00:48:48,803 --> 00:48:55,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll look at like the like the popular style architecture or they'll be like, it'll be like no robo sex.

869
00:48:55,864 --> 00:48:58,120
Speaker 1: You know, there's a social commentary in a Futurama.

870
00:48:58,421 --> 00:48:59,826
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's so.

871
00:49:00,047 --> 00:49:00,569
Speaker 1: it takes like.

872
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:03,620
Speaker 1: it takes a current social issue and extracts it out to the future robo.

873
00:49:04,262 --> 00:49:06,368
Speaker 0: Yep, but they rarely make focus of the episode.

874
00:49:06,388 --> 00:49:09,418
Speaker 0: The real focus of the episode is the character driven joke humor.

875
00:49:09,438 --> 00:49:12,420
Speaker 0: joke If I got a word is joke humor.

876
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,240
Speaker 1: That's what South Park, right?

877
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:21,700
Speaker 1: Will make the focus of the episode that social commentary and have the sort of plot on the side Whereas Futurama is the same thing only flips slightly.

878
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:28,820
Speaker 0: So right part of my feeling about South Park is colored by the fact that I've watched so many of those one episode commentaries.

879
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:33,460
Speaker 1: We watch the Futurama Extras and things but the commentaries weren't as good.

880
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:37,860
Speaker 0: They didn't talk as much about like the jokes and they were long and I want to watch them all the way through.

881
00:49:38,382 --> 00:49:47,352
Speaker 0: It wasn't like South Park where they'll tell you the secret that yeah this whole episode I really really wanted to see Cartman in his little boat t-shirt.

882
00:49:47,733 --> 00:49:49,359
Speaker 0: I feel like that really like that's funny to me.

883
00:49:50,041 --> 00:49:52,592
Speaker 0: He's really funny or we didn't know what the fuck we were doing.

884
00:49:52,632 --> 00:49:53,336
Speaker 0: So crab people.

885
00:49:53,356 --> 00:50:01,790
Speaker 0: Yeah This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
