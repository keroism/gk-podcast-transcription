1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,257
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, May 3rd.

2
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:12,900
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,649 --> 00:00:14,039
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,458
Speaker 1: And this is TechGeeknight.

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,899
Speaker 0: Talking slow for some reason.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,620
Speaker 1: Tonight, giving gifts to nerdy people.

7
00:00:24,282 --> 00:00:25,298
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

8
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:29,709
Speaker 1: So last night, we had a little game night.

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,289
Speaker 1: Played some Zendo, which apparently Natalie is the master of.

10
00:00:33,732 --> 00:00:43,150
Speaker 0: Well, the guy who wrote the game said in his blog that girls, in his opinion, many years of running this game for people are way better at Zendo than guys.

11
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,270
Speaker 0: Pretty much universally.

12
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,570
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, Judith and Emily were not nearly as good as Natalie.

13
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,569
Speaker 1: Natalie is like the queen of Zendo.

14
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:50,288
Speaker 0: Well, for now.

15
00:00:50,891 --> 00:00:54,510
Speaker 1: She exhibited the Buddha nature very extremely frequently.

16
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:57,870
Speaker 0: Ah, but she did it in the Scott- The overwhelming majority of the time.

17
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:04,890
Speaker 0: I point out that she did it in the Scott Johnson fashion of sit there for 20 minutes not moving and then suddenly say the answer.

18
00:01:05,464 --> 00:01:05,690
Speaker 1: Anyway.

19
00:01:07,231 --> 00:01:12,090
Speaker 1: So I'm going home and I already knew in advance that I was missing the hockey game for game night.

20
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,290
Speaker 1: Which is okay because it's not like it's the finals yet, right?

21
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:16,490
Speaker 0: I mean, it was an important game.

22
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,889
Speaker 0: I really wanted the Rangers to win.

23
00:01:18,832 --> 00:01:23,955
Speaker 1: So I get home and I go to ESPN.com and it says OT1, tied 1-1.

24
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,669
Speaker 1: And I'm like, oh shit, son.

25
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,809
Speaker 1: So I bring up my illegal stream on the HTPC.

26
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,570
Speaker 1: And basically it was in between the first and second overtimes.

27
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:34,115
Speaker 1: Tied 1-1.

28
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:36,610
Speaker 0: Now, if you're not familiar with hockey.

29
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,130
Speaker 1: Well, here's the rules of hockey, right?

30
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:42,930
Speaker 1: So in the regular season of the NHL under the current rules, which changed only a few years ago.

31
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:49,590
Speaker 1: If there's a tie at the end of the third period, you go to the first overtime, which is a short overtime.

32
00:01:49,712 --> 00:01:50,749
Speaker 1: That's only four on four.

33
00:01:51,952 --> 00:01:56,830
Speaker 1: If there is a tie at the end of that short overtime, you then do the shootout, right?

34
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,850
Speaker 1: I'm not going to go through all the shootout rules.

35
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, when I was a kid, I was a big fan of the shootout.

36
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:01,908
Speaker 1: Now I don't like the shootout.

37
00:02:02,171 --> 00:02:07,229
Speaker 0: I'm less of a fan of it, but I like it better than doing the, well, we're tied because I hate that.

38
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,269
Speaker 0: I hate ties.

39
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,970
Speaker 1: But in the playoffs, the way it works is the awesomest.

40
00:02:12,813 --> 00:02:13,969
Speaker 1: Oh, it's a tie game.

41
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:17,670
Speaker 1: We play a full another 20 minute period, right?

42
00:02:18,392 --> 00:02:21,250
Speaker 1: And if anyone scores, they win immediately, golden goal.

43
00:02:22,272 --> 00:02:29,288
Speaker 1: And if that overtime ends and nobody has won with their golden goal, we play another 20 minute overtime period.

44
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,010
Speaker 1: And they just keep playing hockey, period after period, until somebody scores.

45
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,328
Speaker 1: You could theoretically play forever, right?

46
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,250
Speaker 1: Because you must win.

47
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,039
Speaker 1: It's a playoff game.

48
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,809
Speaker 1: Someone must win.

49
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:41,370
Speaker 1: This game went to three overtimes.

50
00:02:41,691 --> 00:02:43,190
Speaker 0: That is crazy.

51
00:02:43,591 --> 00:02:46,710
Speaker 1: And the Rangers didn't score until they were only like five minutes left.

52
00:02:46,871 --> 00:02:55,389
Speaker 1: And they were so tired and everyone was like, but then when you win that kind of game, it's the best because they won it away.

53
00:02:56,152 --> 00:03:03,250
Speaker 1: So all the Capitals fans, when they scored that goal, were just like, oh, it was so good.

54
00:03:04,857 --> 00:03:12,330
Speaker 0: And the thing is, I didn't notice because after the game, I noticed the whole pack selling out in a very short amount of time thing.

55
00:03:12,673 --> 00:03:15,950
Speaker 0: So I was dealing with that and people are emailing me and I'm poking around and everything.

56
00:03:16,355 --> 00:03:17,390
Speaker 0: And then I see Scott's tweet.

57
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,602
Speaker 0: He's like, OT3?

58
00:03:18,622 --> 00:03:18,986
Speaker 0: And I'm like, what?

59
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:23,570
Speaker 1: If it was OT4, I was going to be like, but it was already.

60
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,170
Speaker 0: There are very few OT4s in the history of hockey.

61
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,826
Speaker 1: The game ended at midnight 30 Eastern.

62
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:34,250
Speaker 0: I mean, I saw a Red Wings game when, oh my God, when was it?

63
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,779
Speaker 0: It was, I don't know.

64
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:36,908
Speaker 0: I saw Red Wings game a long time ago.

65
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,930
Speaker 1: I think it was a seven o'clock game, maybe.

66
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:43,710
Speaker 0: So you know what the record is for the longest overtime ever in NHL hockey?

67
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:44,270
Speaker 1: What is it?

68
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,309
Speaker 0: It was the Red Wings versus the Montreal Maroons.

69
00:03:47,832 --> 00:03:48,630
Speaker 1: Not the Canadians.

70
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,210
Speaker 0: Nope.

71
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,170
Speaker 1: This is way back in the day.

72
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,210
Speaker 0: Montreal Maroons in 1936.

73
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,129
Speaker 1: Yeah, so pre-NHL.

74
00:03:55,473 --> 00:03:56,929
Speaker 0: How many overtimes do you think it was?

75
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,850
Speaker 1: I'm going to guess it's either, it's got to be a ridiculous number.

76
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:01,729
Speaker 1: Ten overtimes.

77
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:02,950
Speaker 0: Six, actually.

78
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:03,244
Speaker 0: Okay.

79
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,409
Speaker 0: There have only been two games ever that went to six.

80
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:05,857
Speaker 0: Whoa.

81
00:04:05,857 --> 00:04:12,909
Speaker 0: 116 minutes and 30 seconds of overtime play and the final score...

82
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,650
Speaker 1: Plus the 60, that doesn't count the 60 minutes of regular play?

83
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:15,846
Speaker 1: Nope.

84
00:04:16,652 --> 00:04:19,165
Speaker 0: And the final score of the entire game was 1-0 Wings.

85
00:04:22,232 --> 00:04:24,470
Speaker 0: That, think about how long that would have gone.

86
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:25,749
Speaker 0: Think about that.

87
00:04:26,112 --> 00:04:26,789
Speaker 0: Oh my gosh.

88
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,930
Speaker 1: I don't think there were that many spectators in the days of the Montreal Maroons.

89
00:04:30,193 --> 00:04:30,869
Speaker 1: I could be wrong.

90
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,730
Speaker 0: I've never, you know, I'm a big fan of hockey.

91
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,750
Speaker 0: I've never heard of the Montreal Maroons.

92
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:40,990
Speaker 1: Uh, you know, this was pre-Original Six.

93
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:45,590
Speaker 0: They were the last non-Original Six team to win the Stanley Cup until the expansion.

94
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:53,091
Speaker 0: Until the Flyers won as an expansion team in 1974.

95
00:04:53,091 --> 00:04:53,322
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

96
00:04:54,257 --> 00:04:54,468
Speaker 0: Wow.

97
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,450
Speaker 0: You realize if I just have Wikipedia in front of me and I don't, you know, let on and I don't know stuff?

98
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,790
Speaker 0: I sound like I know stuff.

99
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,670
Speaker 1: This is why, uh, let me reveal the secret which I've revealed many times.

100
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,123
Speaker 0: Oh, wait.

101
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:08,169
Speaker 0: Is this the secret of the world or just the secret of being a tech guy?

102
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,190
Speaker 1: The long-revealed secret.

103
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,967
Speaker 1: The curtain has been away, you know, from covering this man behind it for years.

104
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:19,310
Speaker 1: But we are only smart because we read internets.

105
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,670
Speaker 1: We actually don't know shit.

106
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,208
Speaker 0: Well, no, no, no.

107
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:21,730
Speaker 0: We're smart.

108
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,690
Speaker 0: We're not knowledgeable.

109
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:24,189
Speaker 1: There's a big difference.

110
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,530
Speaker 1: All we do is read internets.

111
00:05:25,771 --> 00:05:27,370
Speaker 1: That's how the source of all our knowledge.

112
00:05:27,811 --> 00:05:40,009
Speaker 1: If you also read internets as much as we do and stay connected to it constantly and have the instinct to, whenever you have any question whatsoever, to use the Google, you will be as smart or even likely smarter than we are.

113
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:41,410
Speaker 1: And more knowledgeable.

114
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:42,787
Speaker 1: So do that.

115
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,650
Speaker 1: Don't listen to us because you're getting fifth-hand knowledge.

116
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:47,709
Speaker 0: So it's Thursday.

117
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,230
Speaker 0: It's the lounge on Geek Nights.

118
00:05:50,613 --> 00:05:52,250
Speaker 0: Though I do want to say it's kind of an aside.

119
00:05:53,832 --> 00:05:55,650
Speaker 1: There's no lounge singers in this lounge.

120
00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:03,129
Speaker 0: The only podcasts or radio shows or anything that I listen to are... Well, I was listening to Norman Centuries, but it kind of just stopped.

121
00:06:03,852 --> 00:06:05,210
Speaker 1: I actually only listen to half of it.

122
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,809
Speaker 0: I listen to every episode that's out, but it just stopped like a long time ago.

123
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,349
Speaker 0: So I don't know what's up with that.

124
00:06:11,492 --> 00:06:14,329
Speaker 0: I listen to This American Life, but I'm going through the archives right now.

125
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:19,590
Speaker 0: I listen to It's All Politics from NPR News, which is my favorite political podcast.

126
00:06:20,036 --> 00:06:21,110
Speaker 0: My favorite political anything.

127
00:06:22,272 --> 00:06:23,370
Speaker 0: And I listen to Anime World Order.

128
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:28,730
Speaker 0: And I listen to Dave and Joel's Fast Crowded for the Gentlemen, which is the funniest thing I listen to on the internet.

129
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,570
Speaker 1: I listen to Anime World Order.

130
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:38,130
Speaker 1: I listen to ESPN, pardon the interruption because I don't have cable, so I can't watch it and listening to it is just as good and doesn't have as many commercials.

131
00:06:39,254 --> 00:06:40,450
Speaker 1: I listen to Judge John Hodgman.

132
00:06:40,812 --> 00:06:41,949
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, Judge John Hodgman.

133
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,750
Speaker 1: He delivers the justice swiftly.

134
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:52,450
Speaker 1: I listen to a few episodes of Comic Geek Speak now and then, usually the ones where they go over what's in the big, ugly catalog and what to buy.

135
00:06:54,772 --> 00:06:57,403
Speaker 1: And I listen to Atomic Tribute War 9000, which I am on sometimes.

136
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:08,990
Speaker 0: But a fortuitous moment happened because I happened to be listening to a podcast and this great This American Life on conventions ended and it was great.

137
00:07:09,631 --> 00:07:10,849
Speaker 1: Was it about nerdy conventions?

138
00:07:11,411 --> 00:07:12,230
Speaker 0: All kinds of conventions.

139
00:07:13,654 --> 00:07:15,569
Speaker 0: Scott, do you know what This American Life is?

140
00:07:16,091 --> 00:07:16,809
Speaker 1: Some NPR show.

141
00:07:17,074 --> 00:07:17,889
Speaker 0: Have you ever listened to it?

142
00:07:19,994 --> 00:07:20,810
Speaker 0: Anyway, you should.

143
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:27,208
Speaker 0: So it ends and Google Play or listen or whatever just picks another thing.

144
00:07:27,268 --> 00:07:31,881
Speaker 0: that's in my queue and I hear us and I'm like, "What?

145
00:07:32,302 --> 00:07:33,226
Speaker 0: I don't subscribe to my own

146
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:33,828
Speaker 0: podcast.".

147
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,230
Speaker 0: I only subscribe to like six podcasts.

148
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,830
Speaker 1: Why would I listen to this piece of shit?

149
00:07:37,412 --> 00:07:39,105
Speaker 0: I only subscribe to like six podcasts.

150
00:07:39,206 --> 00:07:39,690
Speaker 0: How is this?

151
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,369
Speaker 0: So then I realize...

152
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,170
Speaker 1: I do subscribe to our show but I just delete every episode before it downloads from iTunes.

153
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,389
Speaker 1: I just need to make sure it's working.

154
00:07:46,776 --> 00:07:47,550
Speaker 1: That's how I monitor.

155
00:07:49,591 --> 00:07:54,909
Speaker 0: So a long time ago, like many years ago, not the last Otacon we went to.

156
00:07:56,693 --> 00:08:03,490
Speaker 0: We used to have a tradition that died where we would get guest hosts to do geek nights in our format, like straight up, like news, things of the day.

157
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,769
Speaker 1: You mean we did it like a handful of times and that was it?

158
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,989
Speaker 0: We did it a bunch of times because we did it every year.

159
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,150
Speaker 0: See, I'm remembering this because we said these words on that show.

160
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,590
Speaker 0: We did it every year for several years when Otacon was happening.

161
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:19,070
Speaker 1: One year we got a whole bunch of episodes but we didn't really carry through with it that much.

162
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, years before we did it but we did like one.

163
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:33,789
Speaker 0: One year we got one but then we were in Wildwood and it didn't appear correctly and we couldn't get to any PC to re-upload it because there was no internet back then at the beach like we have now.

164
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:42,929
Speaker 0: But anyway, Fast Karate for the Gentlemen, Dave and Joel, did a Fast Karate for the Geek Nights on MD Guys 2, The Death Force.

165
00:08:43,475 --> 00:08:44,910
Speaker 0: And I'd forgotten that this happened.

166
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,308
Speaker 0: Like we put it in our feed and we forgot about it.

167
00:08:47,910 --> 00:09:00,549
Speaker 0: So they put it in their feed as filler and what's really funny is that the intro is us saying, "Hey, this is guest hosts, not us, and this is

168
00:09:00,609 --> 00:09:00,830
Speaker 0: funny.".

169
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:07,390
Speaker 0: And you and I are legit cracking up while we're talking about this episode of Fast Karate for the Geek Nights.

170
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,248
Speaker 0: Like you said something like, "This is one of the funniest things I've ever

171
00:09:10,289 --> 00:09:10,430
Speaker 0: heard.".

172
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,970
Speaker 0: And you're like laughing, like actually laughing, not fake laughing.

173
00:09:14,232 --> 00:09:15,058
Speaker 0: So I listened to it.

174
00:09:15,783 --> 00:09:16,850
Speaker 0: God damn is it funny.

175
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:18,807
Speaker 1: Even though it's so old.

176
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:23,490
Speaker 0: Well because one, Dave Riley does, like Joel didn't really like know what was going on.

177
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:27,368
Speaker 0: and Dave goes through our format in this very literal way.

178
00:09:27,388 --> 00:09:30,380
Speaker 0: so he's like, "So I guess now we gotta talk about, you know, just stuff.

179
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,829
Speaker 0: It's like the free forum opening part before we talk about the main

180
00:09:32,849 --> 00:09:32,990
Speaker 0: stuff.".

181
00:09:33,611 --> 00:09:37,850
Speaker 0: So I was doing laundry and he launches into this like mundane anecdote about laundry.

182
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:38,888
Speaker 1: That's our show.

183
00:09:39,131 --> 00:09:47,170
Speaker 0: And it turns out that that anecdote is in fact wonderful and involves a human tooth and it is just off the hook from that point onward.

184
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:53,809
Speaker 0: So I think it is proof that our format is good and also proof that you should listen to Fast Karate if you don't.

185
00:09:54,313 --> 00:09:54,949
Speaker 0: Because it's great.

186
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,949
Speaker 1: Actually I used to listen to it all the time and I did not not enjoy it.

187
00:09:59,331 --> 00:10:00,350
Speaker 0: You should not pick it up again.

188
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,190
Speaker 1: But I have not listened to it in a long time.

189
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,930
Speaker 0: Listen to the most recent episode, Driving While Minota.

190
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,884
Speaker 1: I have not listened to it since the 24 era.

191
00:10:07,973 --> 00:10:08,396
Speaker 0: You know how?

192
00:10:08,497 --> 00:10:09,303
Speaker 0: Driving While Black?

193
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:10,310
Speaker 0: Well, Driving While Minota.

194
00:10:10,837 --> 00:10:10,984
Speaker 0: Okay.

195
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:11,827
Speaker 0: So it's pretty good.

196
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,630
Speaker 1: Do you drive in a labyrinth?

197
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:23,010
Speaker 0: Remember in like 2005 when people would do like promos for other shows on their podcast because podcasting was a thing?

198
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,170
Speaker 0: There was a podcasting community.

199
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:30,110
Speaker 1: There are still people who are podcast listeners but they pretty much go hand in hand with radio listeners.

200
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, podcasting is just a medium now.

201
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,482
Speaker 0: But back then it was a thing.

202
00:10:33,563 --> 00:10:34,350
Speaker 0: Like there was a club.

203
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:40,210
Speaker 0: Like we knew a lot of the podcasters out there and everybody had this like incestuous weird community.

204
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:40,808
Speaker 1: Whatever.

205
00:10:41,156 --> 00:10:41,349
Speaker 0: Yeah.

206
00:10:41,651 --> 00:10:42,781
Speaker 0: Those were weird days.

207
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:43,709
Speaker 0: I think back on that.

208
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:48,330
Speaker 0: I mean remember we were trying to help that real radio station start a podcast?

209
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:48,818
Speaker 1: Yeah.

210
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:49,379
Speaker 1: Yeah.

211
00:10:49,694 --> 00:10:49,970
Speaker 1: Anyway.

212
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,608
Speaker 0: Those were weird times.

213
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,310
Speaker 1: So was that supposed to be your news?

214
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,721
Speaker 0: No, that was just some stuff.

215
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:55,245
Speaker 0: It's Thursday.

216
00:10:55,265 --> 00:10:55,810
Speaker 0: It's the lounge.

217
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,429
Speaker 0: Talk about whatever I want.

218
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,290
Speaker 1: You and your lounge.

219
00:10:58,733 --> 00:10:59,110
Speaker 0: You got a news?

220
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,961
Speaker 1: I have sort of news.

221
00:11:00,981 --> 00:11:01,750
Speaker 1: It's not really news.

222
00:11:02,153 --> 00:11:04,249
Speaker 1: I think I might have mentioned this in the show before.

223
00:11:05,572 --> 00:11:08,690
Speaker 1: And this isn't advertising because no one paid me to do this directly.

224
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,050
Speaker 1: But there's this website called TaskRabbit, right?

225
00:11:12,352 --> 00:11:13,290
Speaker 1: TaskRabbit.com.

226
00:11:14,231 --> 00:11:16,550
Speaker 1: And it is the awesomest website.

227
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:19,150
Speaker 1: Well it's not the awesomest ever but it's really awesome.

228
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,088
Speaker 1: The way it works is this.

229
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,229
Speaker 1: You need somebody to do something for you.

230
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:27,310
Speaker 0: Scott, that Detroit, sorry, that Red Wings game that was the longest ever was the Stanley Cup playoff game.

231
00:11:27,794 --> 00:11:28,530
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

232
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:29,183
Speaker 0: Anyway.

233
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:30,643
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

234
00:11:30,786 --> 00:11:31,010
Speaker 1: Anyway.

235
00:11:31,572 --> 00:11:37,729
Speaker 1: So let's say you need somebody to go to help you drive something home from the Ikea.

236
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:42,890
Speaker 1: Or maybe you need somebody to do your laundry or clean your dishes.

237
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:50,309
Speaker 1: Or maybe you need someone to fix something that broke in your house and you don't know how to fix it.

238
00:11:51,495 --> 00:11:52,889
Speaker 1: Or something like that.

239
00:11:54,016 --> 00:11:54,909
Speaker 1: And you don't know anyone.

240
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:58,627
Speaker 1: And you don't want to pay a professional and start looking through the Yellow Pages.

241
00:11:58,668 --> 00:11:59,130
Speaker 1: That's awful.

242
00:11:59,992 --> 00:12:01,870
Speaker 1: You go to TaskRabbit and you put in a task.

243
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:05,470
Speaker 1: So what I needed was I needed someone to take my shit to Goodwill to donate it.

244
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,490
Speaker 1: I had a bunch of old ass clothes I hadn't worn in years.

245
00:12:07,891 --> 00:12:10,269
Speaker 1: They were in my house taking up space which I don't have a lot of.

246
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,948
Speaker 1: And I said, "Get these the fuck out of

247
00:12:11,968 --> 00:12:12,070
Speaker 1: here.".

248
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:16,230
Speaker 1: But I couldn't take them out myself because there was no donation box nearby.

249
00:12:16,831 --> 00:12:17,869
Speaker 1: I no longer have a car.

250
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,093
Speaker 1: And whatever.

251
00:12:19,153 --> 00:12:21,390
Speaker 1: So it was a pain in the ass to get all these things out of my house.

252
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,750
Speaker 1: So I went and there was actually an item for donation pickup.

253
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:25,556
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "Oh.

254
00:12:25,838 --> 00:12:26,423
Speaker 1: How about that?

255
00:12:26,444 --> 00:12:27,069
Speaker 1: I will use

256
00:12:27,109 --> 00:12:27,190
Speaker 1: that.".

257
00:12:27,932 --> 00:12:30,027
Speaker 1: So you go in and what I did is I said, "Donation

258
00:12:30,068 --> 00:12:30,370
Speaker 1: pickup.".

259
00:12:30,511 --> 00:12:31,747
Speaker 1: And they said, "Describe what you

260
00:12:31,808 --> 00:12:31,970
Speaker 1: want.".

261
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:35,004
Speaker 1: I'm like, "I got two trash bags full of donation stuff.

262
00:12:35,305 --> 00:12:36,109
Speaker 1: Just get them out of

263
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:36,330
Speaker 1: here.".

264
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:37,313
Speaker 1: You know.

265
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,825
Speaker 1: And take them away.

266
00:12:38,905 --> 00:12:39,490
Speaker 1: That's all I want.

267
00:12:40,691 --> 00:12:41,820
Speaker 1: And then it's like, "Okay.

268
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:42,747
Speaker 1: How much are you willing to

269
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:43,050
Speaker 1: pay?".

270
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:43,895
Speaker 1: And I was like, "Man.

271
00:12:43,915 --> 00:12:46,329
Speaker 1: I would pay 40 bucks to get this shit out of

272
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:46,430
Speaker 1: here.".

273
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:49,849
Speaker 1: And it gives you a little graph showing you what other people have paid for the same thing.

274
00:12:50,331 --> 00:12:52,649
Speaker 1: So you don't have to pick some random number and don't know what to do.

275
00:12:53,591 --> 00:12:54,501
Speaker 1: Then it says, "Okay.

276
00:12:54,521 --> 00:12:55,250
Speaker 1: You have three choices.

277
00:12:55,652 --> 00:12:58,088
Speaker 1: Choice number one, we'll pick somebody for

278
00:12:58,149 --> 00:12:58,229
Speaker 1: you.".

279
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,610
Speaker 1: And that's the recommended option.

280
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:04,110
Speaker 1: Choice number two, we show you all the offers people have made and you pick one.

281
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,969
Speaker 1: And I forget choice number three.

282
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:07,174
Speaker 1: I said, "All right.

283
00:13:07,274 --> 00:13:08,098
Speaker 0: I'll trust you guys.

284
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,463
Speaker 1: Recommended option.

285
00:13:09,624 --> 00:13:10,527
Speaker 1: You pick something for

286
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:10,628
Speaker 1: me.".

287
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:15,610
Speaker 1: So like an hour later, it texts me and it's this nice lady.

288
00:13:15,691 --> 00:13:16,597
Speaker 1: And she's just like, "Hey.

289
00:13:17,121 --> 00:13:17,524
Speaker 1: I'll do it.

290
00:13:17,524 --> 00:13:17,665
Speaker 1: 22

291
00:13:17,665 --> 00:13:17,806
Speaker 1: bucks.".

292
00:13:19,155 --> 00:13:19,818
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "Oh.

293
00:13:20,703 --> 00:13:21,065
Speaker 1: Okay.".

294
00:13:22,252 --> 00:13:24,709
Speaker 1: And then she texted me whatever and emailed.

295
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,296
Speaker 1: And she's like, "All right.

296
00:13:26,336 --> 00:13:27,564
Speaker 1: I'll come over tomorrow at

297
00:13:27,564 --> 00:13:28,370
Speaker 1: 6.30.".

298
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:28,919
Speaker 1: I'm like, "All

299
00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:29,122
Speaker 1: right.".

300
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,609
Speaker 1: She showed up at 6.30, this nice friendly lady with a little car.

301
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,941
Speaker 1: I brought the stuff downstairs, put it in her car.

302
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:35,585
Speaker 1: She was friendly.

303
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:36,270
Speaker 1: She took it away.

304
00:13:36,951 --> 00:13:40,850
Speaker 1: And then I went online and I just said I had to click a button that says she did it.

305
00:13:41,131 --> 00:13:44,430
Speaker 1: And then I typed in a number of dollars for a tip and then I pushed okay.

306
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,067
Speaker 1: And that was that.

307
00:13:46,294 --> 00:13:47,289
Speaker 1: And it was totally awesome.

308
00:13:48,951 --> 00:13:57,587
Speaker 1: So if you got stuff that you need doing, maybe you have to do something like a big cleaning and you need someone to come help you.

309
00:13:59,474 --> 00:14:04,370
Speaker 1: Or maybe just something that's small, something that you need a small repair.

310
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,281
Speaker 1: The carpenter is not going to come and do that.

311
00:14:06,321 --> 00:14:07,609
Speaker 1: It's too small a job for him.

312
00:14:08,173 --> 00:14:09,108
Speaker 1: These kinds of things.

313
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:13,809
Speaker 1: Help carrying something to the dump because it's too heavy and you're all alone.

314
00:14:14,373 --> 00:14:15,440
Speaker 1: You know, this kind of thing.

315
00:14:16,165 --> 00:14:16,890
Speaker 1: Use this website.

316
00:14:17,551 --> 00:14:25,750
Speaker 1: And the link I'm going to give you, and this is the part where I make money, because I use them, they said, "Scott R. is using TaskRabbit to get all kinds of tasks done.

317
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:26,975
Speaker 1: We think you'll like it too.

318
00:14:27,558 --> 00:14:28,643
Speaker 1: Use my promo code,

319
00:14:28,764 --> 00:14:29,508
Speaker 1: P-A-L-2-8-3.".

320
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,870
Speaker 0: Wait a minute, Captain Advertising.

321
00:14:32,252 --> 00:14:33,490
Speaker 1: Oh, 106.

322
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,133
Speaker 0: Wait a minute.

323
00:14:34,676 --> 00:14:37,530
Speaker 0: Wait one fucking minute, Captain.

324
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:39,650
Speaker 0: Captain, there will never be ads on the show.

325
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:42,189
Speaker 0: It's not an ad because they didn't call me and ask for it.

326
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,475
Speaker 1: It is from me, so it is not paid by them.

327
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,675
Speaker 1: It was only an ad.

328
00:14:48,716 --> 00:14:50,790
Speaker 1: if they call up and buy the ad specifically.

329
00:14:52,031 --> 00:14:54,349
Speaker 1: Anyway, the point is, if you use the promo code or the link...

330
00:14:54,611 --> 00:14:55,950
Speaker 0: You've given me shit for less.

331
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:56,693
Speaker 1: Maybe.

332
00:14:56,956 --> 00:14:57,400
Speaker 1: It's buzz.

333
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,329
Speaker 1: marketing is what it is.

334
00:15:00,452 --> 00:15:03,070
Speaker 1: You get 10 bucks and I also get 10 bucks.

335
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,809
Speaker 1: Hey, that's not bad.

336
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:21,530
Speaker 0: So, actually, that is a pretty good segue because what I want to talk about a little bit is this Australian startup that straight up pays you if you will tweet and/or astroturf to your close personal friends' products.

337
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:22,270
Speaker 1: That's bullshit.

338
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:23,182
Speaker 0: So, what do you mean?

339
00:15:23,202 --> 00:15:23,470
Speaker 1: it's bullshit?

340
00:15:23,752 --> 00:15:25,850
Speaker 1: If you sign up for that, I would kick you in the junk.

341
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,210
Speaker 0: So, here's what's interesting.

342
00:15:28,392 --> 00:15:29,789
Speaker 1: How do they prove that you did it?

343
00:15:30,671 --> 00:15:38,350
Speaker 0: So, they pay you based on how well you do it, like how many of your friends follow through and all sorts of stuff.

344
00:15:39,076 --> 00:15:44,870
Speaker 0: And I didn't read all the details of it, but what I'm more interested in is not this, because astroturfing, not a new thing.

345
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:45,588
Speaker 1: No kidding.

346
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,789
Speaker 0: Not a new debate, not a new topic.

347
00:15:48,052 --> 00:15:51,060
Speaker 1: But astroturfing to your closest friends is like, "You're not even a friend anymore.

348
00:15:51,121 --> 00:15:51,908
Speaker 1: Just get the fuck

349
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:52,089
Speaker 1: out.".

350
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,605
Speaker 0: Yeah, so what's interesting is the first comment on.

351
00:15:54,645 --> 00:15:58,390
Speaker 0: Slashdot says, and I quote, "This should be considered illegal.

352
00:15:58,770 --> 00:15:59,739
Speaker 0: This is advertising.

353
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:00,850
Speaker 0: It is also a lie.

354
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:04,287
Speaker 0: That's fraud, plain and simple, and it is modded up plus five

355
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:04,710
Speaker 0: insightful.".

356
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,106
Speaker 0: You know what?

357
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,143
Speaker 0: It should not be illegal for me.

358
00:16:07,951 --> 00:16:08,423
Speaker 1: That wasn't a lie.

359
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,449
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I guess he... I don't know.

360
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:14,830
Speaker 0: Basically, most of the comments about this...

361
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:19,510
Speaker 1: The point is if you treat your friends like that, if you try to exploit your friends for money, you're not a friend.

362
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,468
Speaker 0: You're front-running me.

363
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:27,390
Speaker 0: What I noticed in all the discussions about this is that people are really mad that this exists.

364
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,990
Speaker 0: Now, I'm not mad that it exists at all, because this stuff has existed forever.

365
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,268
Speaker 0: This is nothing new.

366
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:37,550
Speaker 0: What I'm amazed at is how mad other people are about it, and I wonder why.

367
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:45,389
Speaker 0: Does this mean that people have friends who they think will actually do this to them, and that they would still want to continue to be friends with them?

368
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:50,510
Speaker 1: We have seen very many instances of people with shitty friends and family.

369
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:55,730
Speaker 0: I mean, I had a friend, quote, "friend" in high school, and he was an okay guy.

370
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,449
Speaker 0: He had a ferret who was smarter than he was, but I digress.

371
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,830
Speaker 0: And he got into that Amway scam.

372
00:17:02,152 --> 00:17:02,509
Speaker 0: Big scam.

373
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:11,008
Speaker 0: And the day he brought that up and tried to sell stuff to me, I was basically like, "Yeah, if you bring that up again ever, I'm pretty much not going to talk to you ever

374
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:11,269
Speaker 0: again.".

375
00:17:12,053 --> 00:17:15,470
Speaker 0: And I never really talked to him ever again, because he tried to turn that into a career.

376
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:16,669
Speaker 1: All righty.

377
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:17,410
Speaker 0: Along with his brother.

378
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:18,188
Speaker 1: Yep.

379
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:18,936
Speaker 0: Yeah.

380
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,240
Speaker 0: But the anger at this.

381
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,645
Speaker 0: People were like, "You should block all the URLs.

382
00:17:26,665 --> 00:17:27,387
Speaker 0: You should do everything.

383
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:29,365
Speaker 0: You should ban these people if you're an

384
00:17:29,445 --> 00:17:29,768
Speaker 0: ISP.".

385
00:17:30,051 --> 00:17:36,830
Speaker 0: People are really pissed about this, and I really don't understand why, because we already have ad block.

386
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:44,110
Speaker 0: Are there so many people who have such caustic social relationships to where this is actually a concern?

387
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:44,690
Speaker 1: Yes.

388
00:17:45,655 --> 00:17:45,885
Speaker 0: Yeah.

389
00:17:47,379 --> 00:17:48,430
Speaker 0: It's not a big question.

390
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,670
Speaker 0: It's just a question, and the answer is yes.

391
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:53,930
Speaker 1: Is this why so many people need to watch ponies?

392
00:17:54,230 --> 00:18:02,870
Speaker 0: If you're mad about this, it's because either ... It's kind of like the people who get mad about seeing an ad as opposed to just blocking it.

393
00:18:03,131 --> 00:18:08,129
Speaker 0: These are the people who need to block spam because they know they'll buy stuff from spam if they see it.

394
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:13,990
Speaker 0: And I find that whole side conversation hilarious, so I wanted to bring it to light.

395
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:14,728
Speaker 0: That's all I had to say.

396
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:15,230
Speaker 0: Okay.

397
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,640
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

398
00:18:24,302 --> 00:18:25,499
Speaker 0: Our friend Chase found this.

399
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,819
Speaker 0: I'm going to give credit where credit is due, and he showed it to us.

400
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:32,763
Speaker 0: We were having a night of, oh my God, internet clips, and ...

401
00:18:32,763 --> 00:18:33,439
Speaker 1: You mean that every night?

402
00:18:33,961 --> 00:18:38,639
Speaker 0: You mean the thing we need to turn into a legitimate game, because it's basically just an internet dick-waving contest.

403
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,700
Speaker 1: It's a difficult technological problem.

404
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know.

405
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:46,780
Speaker 0: It's also a difficult game to play, because most of the people who try to play this ...

406
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,059
Speaker 1: Are not as connected to the internet and have less ammo than we do.

407
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:59,220
Speaker 0: Or it's not just a matter of knowing funny things on the internet, because a video that's funny about Patrick Stewart will win for me, but won't win for Scott.

408
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,159
Speaker 0: You've got to have something that will win for the majority of the audience, or you lose.

409
00:19:04,103 --> 00:19:14,859
Speaker 0: So we were playing this, and I brought out some old gems, like those Russian pranks, or the rogue trumpeter, which, you know, those are my go-tos, because I know people haven't seen them.

410
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:22,440
Speaker 0: And Chase won the game by bringing out what I can only describe as an act of genius.

411
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:27,976
Speaker 0: This is someone who has taken a bunch of scenes from Star Wars, and nothing has changed.

412
00:19:33,181 --> 00:19:39,920
Speaker 0: Is played by Arnold, as in characters that Arnold played in other movies.

413
00:19:40,321 --> 00:19:40,662
Speaker 1: Right.

414
00:19:40,924 --> 00:19:44,200
Speaker 1: It's not a guy reading Darth Vader's lines in an Arnold voice.

415
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,360
Speaker 1: It is ...

416
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,690
Speaker 0: Welcome to the party, Richter.

417
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,020
Speaker 0: See you at the party, Richter.

418
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:48,741
Speaker 1: Right.

419
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:56,516
Speaker 1: They took audio clips from Arnold movies and replaced Vader's dialogue with dialogue.

420
00:19:56,536 --> 00:19:58,340
Speaker 1: that sort of makes sense.

421
00:19:59,525 --> 00:20:00,761
Speaker 0: No, what's funny is ...

422
00:20:00,761 --> 00:20:03,500
Speaker 1: But everyone else is still saying their original Star Wars lines.

423
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:10,780
Speaker 0: This shows a sort of phenomenon that I've noticed from a long time ago, because I was really into audio and audio visualizations.

424
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,420
Speaker 0: I promise this will link back up, when I was in high school.

425
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:19,220
Speaker 0: So I would use different visualizers, and I'd listen to a song while watching a visualization of that song.

426
00:20:20,362 --> 00:20:24,100
Speaker 0: And I would notice very strong correlations.

427
00:20:25,941 --> 00:20:35,440
Speaker 0: And I found a visualizer that claimed that it would analyze the audio and do visualizations that were relevant to what was going on in the audio on a high level.

428
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,548
Speaker 0: So yeah, it was open source.

429
00:20:37,589 --> 00:20:39,300
Speaker 0: I looked at the code, and it was random bullshit.

430
00:20:40,261 --> 00:20:44,060
Speaker 0: But if I showed it to other people, they would still see these strong correlations.

431
00:20:44,982 --> 00:20:52,620
Speaker 0: I bring that up, because if you watch this, and it's just Star Wars, Darth Vader's body language is very menacing.

432
00:20:53,540 --> 00:21:01,420
Speaker 0: If you watch this with Arnold doing the lines, the body language still seems to match up with the lines, and it's hilarious instead.

433
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,076
Speaker 1: That's right.

434
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,680
Speaker 0: So, you never notice ...

435
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,180
Speaker 1: Your brain does things, we know this.

436
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,540
Speaker 0: You never notice in Star Wars how much Darth Vader's kinda just shuffling his shoulders back and forth.

437
00:21:10,942 --> 00:21:16,520
Speaker 0: But when it's Arnold, suddenly he's just like ... And it's brilliant.

438
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:17,418
Speaker 0: That cape.

439
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,540
Speaker 0: It also made me realize that I have a scarily encyclopedic knowledge of Arnold Schwarzenegger movies.

440
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,100
Speaker 0: Who doesn't?

441
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:26,787
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm sitting there, and I'm like, "True lies.

442
00:21:27,008 --> 00:21:27,489
Speaker 0: True lies.

443
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:28,612
Speaker 0: Kindergarten cop.

444
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:29,554
Speaker 0: Commando.

445
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:30,076
Speaker 0: True

446
00:21:30,116 --> 00:21:30,477
Speaker 0: lies.".

447
00:21:32,587 --> 00:21:33,312
Speaker 0: Anyway, this is great.

448
00:21:35,607 --> 00:21:36,780
Speaker 1: My thing is not nearly as great.

449
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,355
Speaker 1: There's this guy on the internet, his name is Dr.

450
00:21:39,455 --> 00:21:40,040
Speaker 1: Nerdlove.

451
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,720
Speaker 1: I don't know how much he can help you with, you know, love.

452
00:21:45,161 --> 00:21:48,220
Speaker 1: But anyway, he's got a thousand likes on Facebook, so he's kinda popular, right?

453
00:21:48,861 --> 00:21:49,706
Speaker 1: He wrote this article.

454
00:21:49,727 --> 00:21:51,660
Speaker 1: that's actually a really good article.

455
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,330
Speaker 1: That is, "Learn from this.

456
00:21:53,571 --> 00:21:54,417
Speaker 1: Scott Pilgrim vs.

457
00:21:54,437 --> 00:21:54,517
Speaker 1: the

458
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:54,799
Speaker 1: World."

459
00:21:54,920 --> 00:22:01,860
Speaker 1: And he goes with the in-depth analysis on the romantic tangles and exploits of Scott Pilgrim.

460
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,599
Speaker 0: I wonder if it agrees with what I think.

461
00:22:03,801 --> 00:22:07,796
Speaker 1: He's basically teaching you all sorts of lessons, like, "Don't date a girl named

462
00:22:07,836 --> 00:22:08,378
Speaker 1: Knives."

463
00:22:10,802 --> 00:22:11,569
Speaker 1: "Nobody likes the

464
00:22:11,589 --> 00:22:12,417
Speaker 1: man-child."

465
00:22:12,821 --> 00:22:13,728
Speaker 1: "You are not the center of the

466
00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:14,273
Speaker 1: universe."

467
00:22:15,142 --> 00:22:15,656
Speaker 1: Et cetera.

468
00:22:15,942 --> 00:22:16,171
Speaker 0: But I am.

469
00:22:17,301 --> 00:22:19,620
Speaker 1: And, you know, he's not focusing on the manga or the movie.

470
00:22:20,021 --> 00:22:20,446
Speaker 1: Manga.

471
00:22:20,527 --> 00:22:21,459
Speaker 1: The book or the movie.

472
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:25,420
Speaker 1: He sorta, you know, mixes it all up all over the place, right?

473
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,900
Speaker 1: You know, just taking in everything.

474
00:22:27,821 --> 00:22:32,440
Speaker 1: And, you know, true or not, you know, correct or not, whatever.

475
00:22:32,821 --> 00:22:37,018
Speaker 1: It's a lot of fun to read this, and it was a good read, so read it.

476
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:52,120
Speaker 0: So, in the meta moment, we will be at, not this weekend, but next weekend, May 12th only, though the convention is the 11th and the 12th, Zenkai Con 2012 at the Greater Philadelphia Expo Center at Oaks, Pennsylvania.

477
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,278
Speaker 1: We're doing two- You better have breakfast past 11 AM, bitches.

478
00:22:57,265 --> 00:22:58,140
Speaker 0: That's not gonna happen.

479
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:00,179
Speaker 0: We are doing two lectures there.

480
00:23:00,901 --> 00:23:02,020
Speaker 1: We are- They're sucked.

481
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,160
Speaker 0: I forget which ones we're doing.

482
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:12,480
Speaker 0: One of them involves Dude Bro, "My shit is fucked up, so I have to shoot/slice you two at straight-up dog time," and My Little Pony.

483
00:23:13,264 --> 00:23:14,620
Speaker 0: I think that'll actually be a pretty good one.

484
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:19,580
Speaker 0: The other one's either Diamonds in the Raw for anime you should see, or maybe it's motivational anime, I forget.

485
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:19,976
Speaker 0: Whatever.

486
00:23:20,321 --> 00:23:21,439
Speaker 0: But anyway, it'll be fun.

487
00:23:21,921 --> 00:23:24,780
Speaker 0: It's a smaller con, but it's pretty big, actually.

488
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,840
Speaker 1: And the tabletop gaming is not half bad.

489
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,087
Speaker 0: Yep.

490
00:23:28,023 --> 00:23:30,039
Speaker 0: Some of our friends run it, and our big staff at it.

491
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:37,100
Speaker 0: So if you want to hang out with us at a con, and in an area, this is one of the best cons to do it, because we're not busy.

492
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,079
Speaker 0: We have two events to run.

493
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,400
Speaker 0: We're not staff.

494
00:23:40,981 --> 00:23:42,400
Speaker 0: We have zero responsibilities.

495
00:23:42,781 --> 00:23:45,340
Speaker 1: And there aren't a lot of other events that we're gonna try to go to.

496
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,940
Speaker 1: It's not like PAX, where it's like, "Sorry, can't hang out," going to the keynote.

497
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:48,896
Speaker 1: "Sorry, can't hang

498
00:23:49,018 --> 00:23:49,080
Speaker 1: out."

499
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:49,354
Speaker 1: Yeah.

500
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:55,360
Speaker 0: And it's not like Kinetic Con, where if a panelist catches fire, we have to deal with that shit.

501
00:23:55,762 --> 00:23:58,500
Speaker 0: If the convention catches fire, we will not do shit.

502
00:23:59,524 --> 00:24:00,779
Speaker 0: Other than continue to hang out.

503
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,500
Speaker 0: And maybe, you know, we can go out and get some dinner, hang out.

504
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:03,777
Speaker 0: We'll see.

505
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,839
Speaker 0: Let us know if you're gonna be there.

506
00:24:05,681 --> 00:24:06,094
Speaker 0: Don't be shy.

507
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:07,238
Speaker 1: Anything else?

508
00:24:08,482 --> 00:24:10,835
Speaker 0: So not too long after that, July 13th through 15th.

509
00:24:11,842 --> 00:24:12,399
Speaker 1: Too soon.

510
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,159
Speaker 0: Kinetic Con.

511
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,760
Speaker 0: We are responsible for all the panels, workshops, and lectures at that convention.

512
00:24:19,061 --> 00:24:21,960
Speaker 0: We're gonna be there, doing some of our own panels, lectures, and workshops.

513
00:24:22,362 --> 00:24:23,260
Speaker 0: It's a pretty fun con.

514
00:24:23,743 --> 00:24:28,180
Speaker 0: It's pretty big, relative to most cons, but it's not a-- The tabletop gaming is excellent.

515
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,300
Speaker 1: And in fact, the tabletop gaming library is the best.

516
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,139
Speaker 1: Better than PAX, East, West--.

517
00:24:34,401 --> 00:24:38,560
Speaker 0: Kinetic Con's tabletop is better than MagFest, PAX, any con I've been to.

518
00:24:39,022 --> 00:24:45,940
Speaker 1: To make it even better, if you play games in the Kinetic Con tabletop, this is a little-known fact, you earn tickets just by playing, right?

519
00:24:46,382 --> 00:24:48,660
Speaker 0: And with those tickets-- You can get, like, Dominion.

520
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:58,320
Speaker 1: You can get real, expensive, brand-new board games, but with those tickets the same way that you get chintzy plastic frogs at the arcade with tickets from the, you know, skeeball.

521
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:01,120
Speaker 1: And it doesn't take that many tickets.

522
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,814
Speaker 1: Like, ten tickets, you can get, like, a $40 game.

523
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:13,438
Speaker 1: If you love tabletop games of the awesome kind, just go to Kinetic Con, and if you do nothing else, even though there is plenty other things to do, like Super Art Fight-- Aw, shit.

524
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:24,656
Speaker 1: You can just play tabletop games the whole time and go home with a whole bunch of free tabletop games, and it'll only cost you the price of admission, and if you even take home one game, that's like getting free admission, right?

525
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,579
Speaker 1: I mean, what does it cost to get in there, 50, 60 bucks, something like that, for three days?

526
00:25:29,305 --> 00:25:30,200
Speaker 1: Uh, I don't remember.

527
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:36,120
Speaker 1: So if you win a $40 game, it's like, well, it's like you're paying you with board games to play board games.

528
00:25:36,263 --> 00:25:37,119
Speaker 1: It doesn't get better than that.

529
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, and we have some really good panel content, so, uh, yeah.

530
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,113
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the book club book is 1Q84 by Haruki Murakami.

531
00:25:46,181 --> 00:25:48,179
Speaker 1: It's really popular and shit, that's why we're reading it.

532
00:25:48,541 --> 00:25:54,700
Speaker 0: Also, Otakon, we submitted a bunch of lectures, so if you want us to be there, tell them.

533
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,953
Speaker 0: If we're not there, it's all them, not us.

534
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,270
Speaker 0: PAX Prime is sold out.

535
00:26:00,774 --> 00:26:01,580
Speaker 0: I hope you got a ticket.

536
00:26:03,464 --> 00:26:04,720
Speaker 0: They sold out in a couple hours.

537
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,478
Speaker 1: Like we told you.

538
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,925
Speaker 0: We'll probably be there.

539
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:10,340
Speaker 0: We've got some panels, some lectures in the works.

540
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:18,868
Speaker 0: Brand new stuff, looking pretty good, I think, and I did confirm, just for anyone who's interested, PAX Dev is happening.

541
00:26:18,988 --> 00:26:24,839
Speaker 0: They just haven't announced all the details yet, but absolutely confirmed there will be a PAX Dev before PAX Prime this year.

542
00:26:25,782 --> 00:26:28,180
Speaker 0: I think I'm going to attend, even if I'm not lecturing.

543
00:26:28,341 --> 00:26:28,857
Speaker 1: I may or may not.

544
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,220
Speaker 0: Because I'm kind of the boss now, like I can take time off work without it being a big deal.

545
00:26:34,561 --> 00:26:39,320
Speaker 0: So I'm going to go because, one, I can hang out in Seattle for a few extra days.

546
00:26:39,821 --> 00:26:53,300
Speaker 0: Two, if any indication from last year is true, the people I know who went to PAX Dev said that it was pretty good, but they really wanted to play games afterward, because there's a lot of downtime in the evening.

547
00:26:54,121 --> 00:26:59,740
Speaker 0: And there were not enough hardcore board gamers, but there is a small contingent of hardcore board gamers there.

548
00:27:00,242 --> 00:27:03,158
Speaker 0: And I think that is when I can play Eclipse in Puerto Rico and T&E.

549
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:08,119
Speaker 1: So anyway, I just want to add one more thing about the book club, right?

550
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:13,880
Speaker 1: I've been using various different logical ways to choose my next book choice, right?

551
00:27:14,561 --> 00:27:20,680
Speaker 1: And even though Rym has the next choice, I'm going to tell you right now I have decided on only one method of book choosing for the foreseeable future.

552
00:27:21,282 --> 00:27:21,736
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

553
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,898
Speaker 1: You know what that method is?

554
00:27:23,181 --> 00:27:23,480
Speaker 0: Random?

555
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:24,117
Speaker 1: No.

556
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,220
Speaker 0: The top hundred whatever books of all time?

557
00:27:27,361 --> 00:27:27,576
Speaker 0: No.

558
00:27:28,841 --> 00:27:29,085
Speaker 0: Anything?

559
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:29,350
Speaker 0: I don't know.

560
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:29,920
Speaker 0: What are you going to do?

561
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,700
Speaker 1: Book I already own and have not read.

562
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:32,802
Speaker 0: Oh.

563
00:27:35,324 --> 00:27:36,160
Speaker 0: That's a good philosophy.

564
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:37,655
Speaker 1: That's what I'm doing from now on.

565
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,219
Speaker 0: Uh, I think I'm doing the same.

566
00:27:41,671 --> 00:27:41,818
Speaker 1: Right.

567
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,840
Speaker 0: That's uh, you're a genius, Scott.

568
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:45,208
Speaker 1: Yup.

569
00:27:47,322 --> 00:27:49,960
Speaker 1: So this episode is about geek gifting, right?

570
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:55,200
Speaker 1: So I had this idea and this idea came to me because my birthday was recent, carousel time.

571
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,699
Speaker 1: I'm already dead, if you didn't know.

572
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,385
Speaker 1: Oh my.

573
00:27:57,791 --> 00:27:58,399
Speaker 0: Oh, she did.

574
00:28:00,122 --> 00:28:03,640
Speaker 1: Uh, and you know, my mom thought she was cute and she sent me a birthday card.

575
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:06,399
Speaker 1: Just sort of generic and I shoved it in with all the other cards in the box.

576
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:11,740
Speaker 1: Uh, but in that card, there was some pony stickers because my mom is like that.

577
00:28:12,364 --> 00:28:13,480
Speaker 0: You know what's interesting?

578
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,776
Speaker 0: Just because you bring that up.

579
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:26,740
Speaker 0: Pretty much every card, gift, anything I've gotten since My Little Pony became a thing and it was obvious that I was a big fan of it, has had a pony thing in it, so.

580
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,780
Speaker 1: Now, you know, I appreciate this gift of pony stickers, right?

581
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:38,660
Speaker 1: Because number one, it shows that my mom is not, you know, a stupid mom or I don't have bad parents like I see on the internet, people complaining about so often.

582
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,123
Speaker 0: What do you know?

583
00:28:39,164 --> 00:28:40,760
Speaker 0: You see that through Daryl Surratt's Twitter.

584
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,580
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, there's a lot of them out there.

585
00:28:42,961 --> 00:28:50,560
Speaker 1: I see a lot of stories like parents thinking their kids are gay because they're watching ponies or you know, all kinds of bad stuff, right?

586
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:54,140
Speaker 0: You saw the Daryl Surratt ad, he doubled down, now it's fuck you grandma.

587
00:28:54,440 --> 00:29:01,439
Speaker 1: I know, but to have parents who not only are like okay with, you know, watching ponies, but are like we'll send you pony stickers and be like lolz.

588
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,439
Speaker 0: Dude, your mom watched Radio Free Equestria.

589
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is some good parents right there.

590
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,140
Speaker 1: So anyway, but the thing is, they were the wrong ponies.

591
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,560
Speaker 1: They were third gen pony stickers.

592
00:29:11,881 --> 00:29:13,219
Speaker 0: Wait, oh, you know what that's like?

593
00:29:14,202 --> 00:29:32,839
Speaker 0: So let's say that I am going, I am, you know, a knight and I'm an emissary of some fantasy empire and I'm going to some other fantasy empire in a Forgotten Islands kind of world and I bring diamonds as a gift, but diamonds are bad in that place because diamonds are what the evil god,

594
00:29:32,879 --> 00:29:33,160
Speaker 1: you know.

595
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:34,739
Speaker 0: Nerds care about that.

596
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:40,280
Speaker 1: And you know, this reminded me of another similar incident, you know, to get again to show how my mom is cool, right?

597
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:56,760
Speaker 1: When I was a kid, I would buy the comic books at the comic book store when comic books only cost $1.25 and there were only two comic books that I read in the 90s, Adjectiveless X-Men and Spider-Man 2099. and my mom, she, you know, and my mom is somewhat nerdy, right?

598
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,200
Speaker 1: She likes the old horror stuff, she likes James Bond, she likes Zatoichi, you know, she's kind of nerdy.

599
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:12,560
Speaker 1: But she thought, hey, you know, she must have been in the mall or something and went to the comic book store and she knew that I read Spider-Man 2099, she knew that much, right?

600
00:30:13,303 --> 00:30:14,959
Speaker 1: And she bought the issue that was there.

601
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:19,700
Speaker 1: I think it was issue 10, but I already had issue 10.

602
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,579
Speaker 1: I needed issue 11, which is not out yet.

603
00:30:22,182 --> 00:30:28,440
Speaker 0: My parents actually had a lot better luck in that front because they, one, I mean, my mom, like, they made me watch Vampire Hunter D. Yeah, that's true.

604
00:30:28,521 --> 00:30:29,320
Speaker 0: So they got me into anime.

605
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:29,858
Speaker 1: That's true.

606
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,059
Speaker 0: So then they'd be like, let's buy some anime.

607
00:30:32,801 --> 00:30:34,140
Speaker 1: I mean, it was easy to get me gifts.

608
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,240
Speaker 1: We do not take our geekery supporting parents for granted.

609
00:30:37,323 --> 00:30:37,475
Speaker 1: No.

610
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:43,140
Speaker 1: Yet, at the same time, even geekery supporting parents will get it wrong.

611
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,240
Speaker 1: I guess they couldn't get it wrong with Magic Cards, right?

612
00:30:46,461 --> 00:30:49,140
Speaker 1: You can't go wrong there, if that's what you want.

613
00:30:49,565 --> 00:30:50,459
Speaker 1: But the point is this.

614
00:30:51,120 --> 00:31:01,115
Speaker 1: It is really, if you are not a nerd who is very, very close to the other nerd that you are gifting for, it is next to impossible to get them a gift.

615
00:31:01,737 --> 00:31:02,460
Speaker 1: that is correct.

616
00:31:03,241 --> 00:31:11,060
Speaker 1: Unless it is incredibly expensive or they themselves lack money and cannot buy nerdy things for themselves.

617
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,340
Speaker 0: So let's take the example of the nerd first.

618
00:31:13,782 --> 00:31:16,180
Speaker 0: Like the guy who was hardcore about one thing.

619
00:31:16,861 --> 00:31:17,660
Speaker 1: So he's a Trekkie.

620
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,498
Speaker 1: We'll go with the Trekkie.

621
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,339
Speaker 0: That's the easiest example.

622
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,260
Speaker 0: Alright, so one.

623
00:31:21,061 --> 00:31:22,813
Speaker 0: Are you also a Trekkie or Trekker?

624
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,920
Speaker 0: Do you even realize that they care about the difference?

625
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,860
Speaker 1: I do know they care about the difference, but I admit I do not know the difference.

626
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,740
Speaker 1: I do know there are two words and they mean different things.

627
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,100
Speaker 0: So I'll say this.

628
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:39,400
Speaker 0: If you're not on the same level of them, you're already ten years too early.

629
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:39,980
Speaker 1: Right.

630
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,120
Speaker 1: And it's like, okay, I know that that guy likes Star Trek.

631
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:53,780
Speaker 0: Alright, so what are you going to possibly know about and find that he doesn't already own or chooses not to own because it's a bad thing like a G3 pony?

632
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:54,720
Speaker 1: Exactly, right.

633
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,656
Speaker 1: I could go and get something like, you know, I don't...

634
00:31:57,161 --> 00:31:58,340
Speaker 0: Oh great, a bust of Picard.

635
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,831
Speaker 0: I'll put it next to my other bust of Picard.

636
00:32:00,872 --> 00:32:02,520
Speaker 0: that's signed by Patrick Stewart.

637
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:02,877
Speaker 0: Right.

638
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Speaker 1: It's like, I don't know much about Star Trek, but I am nerdy, so I know some things about it.

639
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,760
Speaker 1: And it's like, what could I think of to get someone who likes Star Trek?

640
00:32:09,881 --> 00:32:13,460
Speaker 1: I could get you like, you know, the Enterprise Technical Manual.

641
00:32:13,721 --> 00:32:14,319
Speaker 0: He's got that.

642
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:14,999
Speaker 1: He's got that.

643
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:20,920
Speaker 1: I could get you the box of Next Generation DVD, but that's just gotten Netflix and they got that.

644
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:28,979
Speaker 0: I guess there's two directions of what you can get him, but they are highly dependent upon knowing what that thing is.

645
00:32:29,161 --> 00:32:31,000
Speaker 1: You have to know what the guy's got.

646
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,900
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll get him like a model of the Voyager, but he hates Voyager.

647
00:32:35,242 --> 00:32:38,120
Speaker 0: My example is going to be, I was going to make it, I was going to double down.

648
00:32:38,341 --> 00:32:38,896
Speaker 0: So check this.

649
00:32:39,321 --> 00:32:45,000
Speaker 0: So one of the best things you can get, a nerd, is a thing that isn't commonly available.

650
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:49,140
Speaker 0: Like, get something signed by someone that they're not likely to meet.

651
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,278
Speaker 1: But even then, they might not like that person.

652
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,880
Speaker 0: So I come with a poster of the Voyager cast signed by whoever played Janeway.

653
00:32:57,961 --> 00:33:02,059
Speaker 0: And they burn it, you know, after I leave because they hate Janeway and they're a Kirk fan or whatever.

654
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,700
Speaker 1: Nerds, it's because someone is a geek, that means that they have a particular taste.

655
00:33:08,061 --> 00:33:12,880
Speaker 1: And if they have money, that means that they are already indulging in this thing that they like so much.

656
00:33:13,641 --> 00:33:16,260
Speaker 1: So to find the thing that they want, right?

657
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:27,500
Speaker 1: You have to be incredibly intimate with the person so much that you know what they've already got, what they want, the specific details of their likes and dislikes of that thing.

658
00:33:28,261 --> 00:33:34,480
Speaker 1: And in that case, it's very likely that the things that they do not have that they want are very, very expensive.

659
00:33:34,922 --> 00:33:39,420
Speaker 1: Like, I know some gifts I could get for some people, but it's like, yeah, that dude collects Avengers.

660
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,300
Speaker 1: He's missing issues two and three.

661
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,200
Speaker 0: Let's see Scott Chase.

662
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,658
Speaker 1: Avengers two and three, what the fuck am I gonna buy?

663
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,800
Speaker 0: Scott, our friend Chase Gordon, I'd get him a bunch of red cameras.

664
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,991
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure, right?

665
00:33:50,293 --> 00:33:51,180
Speaker 1: But you can't afford that.

666
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,895
Speaker 1: You know, it's like, so what are you gonna get him that he would like?

667
00:33:54,915 --> 00:33:56,000
Speaker 1: that doesn't cost a lot of money?

668
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,658
Speaker 1: It's incredibly difficult to do.

669
00:33:57,981 --> 00:34:05,660
Speaker 0: Well, let's cover it because I guess a good example of this, you know, we're talking in terms of stereotypical nerderies and geekeries, Star Trek and whatever.

670
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:10,100
Speaker 0: A wine aficionado is a good example because many of you probably don't know a lot about wine.

671
00:34:10,261 --> 00:34:11,780
Speaker 0: I know a pretty good amount about wine.

672
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:21,659
Speaker 0: I have some co-workers, we were at a fancy wine tasting some time ago, and one of my co-workers, you know, the sommelier brings out a wine and starts explaining it.

673
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:28,588
Speaker 0: And one of my co-workers says, I've actually been to that vineyard and he knew the guy who runs it and his family knows them and he's toured.

674
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:30,455
Speaker 0: He knew a lot.

675
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,619
Speaker 1: Was he pretending to know?

676
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,239
Speaker 0: No, he really knew.

677
00:34:34,341 --> 00:34:35,280
Speaker 1: Using the rim trick?

678
00:34:35,341 --> 00:34:35,898
Speaker 0: No, he really knew.

679
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:49,820
Speaker 0: So, what could I, I like wine, I know a little bit about wine, but my knowledge of wine compared to him is like Scott's knowledge of Star Trek compared to a Star Trek guy.

680
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,280
Speaker 0: That's right.

681
00:34:52,203 --> 00:34:59,960
Speaker 0: So, what wine related gift could I possibly, possibly get him that I would even know to get?

682
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:04,280
Speaker 1: Alright, you could get, A, one of the world's premier wines, right?

683
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,440
Speaker 1: Or like some incredibly famous epic wine for a zillion dollars.

684
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,340
Speaker 0: Okay, so now, one, I have to research heavily.

685
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:16,480
Speaker 1: Well, if you read volume three of Drops of God, you would know like the five premier number one A+ wines of France to get.

686
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,059
Speaker 0: It's just like saying, oh, if a guy has a car.

687
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:19,879
Speaker 1: Get him a Ferrari.

688
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:20,746
Speaker 0: Get him a Ferrari.

689
00:35:20,766 --> 00:35:22,140
Speaker 0: That's exactly what I was going to say.

690
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:28,380
Speaker 0: So, that implies a wealth disparity where you, the gift giver, have more money than the other person.

691
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,348
Speaker 0: And even then, you have to know their taste.

692
00:35:31,649 --> 00:35:34,299
Speaker 0: So, you get a Ferrari for someone who's legless.

693
00:35:34,479 --> 00:35:34,720
Speaker 0: Great.

694
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:37,060
Speaker 1: Maybe he wants Lamborghini, he hates Ferrari.

695
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:45,620
Speaker 0: I get like the rarest, most famous red wine for a guy who actually hates red wine or hates that particular vineyard or already has that wine.

696
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:46,119
Speaker 1: Yep.

697
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,320
Speaker 0: Or, someone who's really into wine but doesn't collect wine.

698
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:56,040
Speaker 0: So, I get him a fancy wine that he can't drink because it's rare and he can't store it because he doesn't have a wine cellar.

699
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:56,613
Speaker 1: Yep.

700
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,050
Speaker 0: Well, he's just going to resell it.

701
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,039
Speaker 0: I might as well get him cash.

702
00:35:59,660 --> 00:35:59,741
Speaker 1: Yeah.

703
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:01,700
Speaker 1: It is incredibly difficult.

704
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:09,140
Speaker 1: So, what do you actually do when you are in a situation where you must get a gift for a nerdy person?

705
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:14,640
Speaker 1: Well, one, you could, like we said, have enough knowledge that you could get them a gift.

706
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,283
Speaker 0: Well, let's cover all those cases first.

707
00:36:16,303 --> 00:36:25,840
Speaker 0: Let's assume that you're giving a gift to someone who has equal knowledge of the thing and you know each other well enough to know what the person already has.

708
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:31,060
Speaker 1: Oh, then it's really easy to get them something because you probably know the exact thing that's missing in their collection.

709
00:36:31,461 --> 00:36:38,120
Speaker 1: Or, you know, you don't actually get them, you know, it's harder when you have to get a gift for a particular time, like a birthday or a wedding.

710
00:36:38,481 --> 00:36:43,997
Speaker 1: It's easier if it's just like you're walking around town, you happen to see something and you're like, "Oh my God, that would be great for

711
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:44,539
Speaker 1: so-and-so.".

712
00:36:45,201 --> 00:36:47,546
Speaker 0: Ah, so let's up the difficulty.

713
00:36:48,308 --> 00:36:53,060
Speaker 0: They are a person who has money similar to the amount of money you have.

714
00:36:53,420 --> 00:37:00,300
Speaker 0: Meaning, sure, you can identify a ton of things they don't have, but because they have money and you have money, they're like us.

715
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,210
Speaker 0: Let's say they buy everything they want.

716
00:37:04,173 --> 00:37:05,357
Speaker 0: That isn't ludicrous.

717
00:37:05,979 --> 00:37:06,340
Speaker 0: Now what?

718
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,769
Speaker 0: They own everything you could possibly think of.

719
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:11,640
Speaker 0: that is in any way like purchasable on Amazon.

720
00:37:12,761 --> 00:37:19,800
Speaker 1: You would have to go outside the box, but it would take a great deal of time and effort and you may not even be able to come up with something.

721
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,609
Speaker 0: That's where you've got to get like the custom thing.

722
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,520
Speaker 0: Like, for example, My Little Pony, right?

723
00:37:24,001 --> 00:37:25,560
Speaker 0: So if someone's really into My Little Pony...

724
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,340
Speaker 1: You can get someone to commission something on DeviantArt.

725
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:27,722
Speaker 0: Exactly.

726
00:37:27,762 --> 00:37:31,220
Speaker 0: They've already got all the shitty toys that Hasbro allowed.

727
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:36,320
Speaker 0: You've got to commission like the real toys made by hand by someone that no one else can get.

728
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,267
Speaker 1: Or, of course, make it yourself, right?

729
00:37:38,648 --> 00:37:41,820
Speaker 1: Like the best gift I ever probably got was the hockey thing from Rowe.

730
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,060
Speaker 1: That is a pretty good thing.

731
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:48,720
Speaker 1: It's like that is not something that I knew I wanted, could have bought on Amazon, or could have imagined.

732
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,309
Speaker 0: Ah, you've hit on the rub, the important part.

733
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,940
Speaker 0: The something I knew I wanted.

734
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:58,340
Speaker 0: Because a nerd who is committed and has enough money...

735
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,139
Speaker 1: Knows what they want.

736
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,439
Speaker 0: And they buy everything they want, or they at least know it.

737
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:11,779
Speaker 0: If you can give someone a gift, who is a nerd, that is related to their nerdery, but is tangential in the sense that it's not something that existed or they would ever have considered getting.

738
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,259
Speaker 0: Like they would never even think to get the thing.

739
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:20,360
Speaker 0: That is pretty much the best possible gift, short of something that is that that you made yourself.

740
00:38:20,962 --> 00:38:22,728
Speaker 1: Right, so for the Star Trek person, right?

741
00:38:23,049 --> 00:38:24,956
Speaker 1: Try to think of some other hobby they have.

742
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:26,180
Speaker 1: Maybe they like to swim.

743
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,348
Speaker 1: Get them like a Star Trek bathing suit.

744
00:38:29,368 --> 00:38:31,616
Speaker 1: They would never think of that in a million years, right?

745
00:38:31,656 --> 00:38:32,760
Speaker 1: But it probably exists.

746
00:38:33,361 --> 00:38:37,175
Speaker 1: Or like a floating enterprise raft for the pool.

747
00:38:37,576 --> 00:38:38,600
Speaker 1: That probably exists.

748
00:38:39,481 --> 00:38:43,253
Speaker 0: Or a fan mashup of all of them like getting ready to swim.

749
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:45,100
Speaker 0: Maybe they're into like ancient ships.

750
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,520
Speaker 0: Or like, you know, so it's a bunch of like Star Trek characters rowing a trireme.

751
00:38:49,502 --> 00:38:52,418
Speaker 1: Yeah, or maybe make a model enterprise and put it in a bottle.

752
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:54,760
Speaker 0: Ah, not bad.

753
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,286
Speaker 1: Yeah, like that.

754
00:38:55,753 --> 00:38:56,219
Speaker 1: How about that?

755
00:38:57,341 --> 00:38:59,280
Speaker 0: Alright, so what if you don't know shit about their hobby?

756
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,719
Speaker 1: You don't know shit at all?

757
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:04,940
Speaker 0: Like you're trying to get a gift for someone where they're super into something.

758
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:07,499
Speaker 1: And you don't know anything about it.

759
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,370
Speaker 0: Well, they're a nerd.

760
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:13,160
Speaker 0: So you know that this is their primary thing.

761
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,315
Speaker 1: So I know that they like Star Trek, but that's it.

762
00:39:15,335 --> 00:39:15,860
Speaker 1: That's all I know.

763
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,859
Speaker 1: That's all you know about them.

764
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,197
Speaker 0: They're the kind of person who is identified.

765
00:39:19,882 --> 00:39:20,697
Speaker 1: So let's switch it to...

766
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,551
Speaker 0: Their identity is defined by that.

767
00:39:23,571 --> 00:39:25,880
Speaker 0: Because I'm starting to lean toward that as a nerd.

768
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:30,260
Speaker 0: A nerd is someone for whom their public identity is defined by their likes.

769
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:36,660
Speaker 1: So let's switch it to like Buffy the Vampire Slayer because I don't actually know anything about it other than there's vampires and there's a girl who fights them.

770
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,440
Speaker 0: And Joss Whedon.

771
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,531
Speaker 1: And Joss Whedon wrote it.

772
00:39:38,592 --> 00:39:39,099
Speaker 1: That's all I know.

773
00:39:39,881 --> 00:39:44,360
Speaker 1: So I know that someone, their favorite thing in the world is Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but that's all I know about it.

774
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:50,839
Speaker 0: So you're probably going to end up doing what your mom did where, "Oh, I'll get him this Buffy board game that I

775
00:39:50,879 --> 00:39:51,200
Speaker 0: found.".

776
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,054
Speaker 0: He hates board games and that game sucks and it's not the right Buffy.

777
00:39:54,075 --> 00:39:55,140
Speaker 0: It's from the show, not the movie.

778
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,791
Speaker 0: He actually only cares about the movie.

779
00:39:57,255 --> 00:39:57,839
Speaker 0: But you don't know that.

780
00:39:58,721 --> 00:40:00,231
Speaker 0: So that fail.

781
00:40:00,573 --> 00:40:01,177
Speaker 0: That's G3 ponies.

782
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,885
Speaker 1: You have to get something.

783
00:40:03,368 --> 00:40:05,680
Speaker 1: They have to like something else in their life, right?

784
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:11,300
Speaker 1: There has to be something else that you can get them outside of that department without going to the gift card route.

785
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,666
Speaker 0: I think this lends itself to a secondary problem.

786
00:40:13,967 --> 00:40:22,076
Speaker 0: There is a situation where there are people you know, you're obligated to give a gift to, you know they're nerdy because almost everyone's nerdy about something.

787
00:40:22,096 --> 00:40:22,880
Speaker 0: It might be football.

788
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:30,779
Speaker 0: But you don't know enough about the thing and because of the nature of your relationship, you only know them as a fan of that thing.

789
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,246
Speaker 0: Like buying a gift for coworkers.

790
00:40:34,286 --> 00:40:35,931
Speaker 0: They're into football.

791
00:40:36,452 --> 00:40:38,117
Speaker 0: I'll get a football thing.

792
00:40:38,177 --> 00:40:38,478
Speaker 1: Sportsball.

793
00:40:39,682 --> 00:40:45,900
Speaker 1: You know, regardless of geekery, a general gift giving strategy is to get a thing that anyone could like.

794
00:40:46,801 --> 00:40:47,423
Speaker 1: Spot it.

795
00:40:47,744 --> 00:40:49,591
Speaker 1: Just get spotted for anybody.

796
00:40:50,334 --> 00:40:51,157
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

797
00:40:51,197 --> 00:40:51,940
Speaker 1: Get them a spot it.

798
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:59,440
Speaker 0: I remember way back at IBM we had this gift giving thing and I went super generic and got a really nice bottle of wine that was like generic.

799
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,347
Speaker 0: Like easy drinking wine.

800
00:41:01,387 --> 00:41:02,593
Speaker 0: Like easy listening music.

801
00:41:02,653 --> 00:41:04,140
Speaker 0: Like something that everyone will kind of like.

802
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:14,259
Speaker 0: And meanwhile, the Eunuch Santa who worked there, who's an awesome dude, got the Star Wars Christmas special on VHS.

803
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:19,368
Speaker 0: And the thing is, most of the people there, it was like a reverse.

804
00:41:19,428 --> 00:41:23,120
Speaker 0: It was like if you're a nerd getting a gift for non-nerds.

805
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:29,795
Speaker 0: Like going deep in and bringing a thing out where you know the danger and some other people will know the danger.

806
00:41:29,875 --> 00:41:31,440
Speaker 0: but not everyone knows the danger.

807
00:41:32,221 --> 00:41:38,159
Speaker 0: Like imagine if you give the Star Wars Christmas special to someone who has no idea in a room where half the people know what it is.

808
00:41:39,982 --> 00:41:41,268
Speaker 0: That whole scene as it plays out.

809
00:41:41,288 --> 00:41:42,956
Speaker 1: The whole room though will probably explode.

810
00:41:42,976 --> 00:41:43,579
Speaker 1: Like whoa!

811
00:41:44,221 --> 00:41:44,302
Speaker 0: Whoa!

812
00:41:44,342 --> 00:41:45,206
Speaker 0: That's danger there.

813
00:41:45,246 --> 00:41:46,130
Speaker 1: You're in a danger zone.

814
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:48,360
Speaker 0: Some kind of zone in which there is danger.

815
00:41:50,562 --> 00:41:52,834
Speaker 0: I think I almost enjoy the reverse case more.

816
00:41:52,854 --> 00:41:53,497
Speaker 0: You know, we're nerds.

817
00:41:53,538 --> 00:41:53,960
Speaker 0: We're geeks.

818
00:41:54,921 --> 00:42:03,580
Speaker 0: When you're giving gifts to people who aren't nerds or geeks, find something that is way inside baseball but also has some either appeal.

819
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,295
Speaker 1: Right, because Star Wars Christmas special, right?

820
00:42:06,376 --> 00:42:07,040
Speaker 1: It's like okay.

821
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:07,820
Speaker 1: It's dangerous.

822
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:12,590
Speaker 1: People know Star Wars even if they're not nerds and there's a thing, right?

823
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:16,860
Speaker 1: So it would be sort of like this clever thing that anyone could understand almost.

824
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,260
Speaker 0: But people, the average person.

825
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,640
Speaker 1: Even if they don't fully understand.

826
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:23,560
Speaker 0: The average person is actually not likely to know about the Star Wars Christmas special.

827
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,109
Speaker 0: So they'd be like, "What do you mean?

828
00:42:25,149 --> 00:42:25,895
Speaker 0: There's more Star

829
00:42:25,916 --> 00:42:26,218
Speaker 0: Wars?".

830
00:42:26,723 --> 00:42:28,015
Speaker 0: And you're like, "Yeah, watch

831
00:42:28,056 --> 00:42:28,258
Speaker 0: this.".

832
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:28,826
Speaker 1: This is official.

833
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:29,619
Speaker 1: This is the real deal.

834
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:35,960
Speaker 0: You gotta give them something either that will get them into your geekery or give them something dangerous because that's hilarious.

835
00:42:37,205 --> 00:42:38,359
Speaker 0: It's basically a poison pill.

836
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:44,559
Speaker 1: You could also give things that are just sort of like generally good but people don't know.

837
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:52,100
Speaker 1: So usually it's hard to buy someone a comic book or a video game because they'll have a library of them, right?

838
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,840
Speaker 1: But people tend not to have too many gadgets.

839
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,490
Speaker 1: So it's like I know he doesn't have an e-reader.

840
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:59,500
Speaker 1: I know he doesn't have a digital camera.

841
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,824
Speaker 0: Ah, technology enabling.

842
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:02,912
Speaker 0: But then you're getting into the realm of expensive.

843
00:43:03,052 --> 00:43:05,040
Speaker 0: If they wanted one they would have already bought it.

844
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:11,495
Speaker 1: What you can't do is you can't try to buy a computer nerd a computer because it's like, "What are you going to do?

845
00:43:11,776 --> 00:43:13,139
Speaker 1: Go and buy me a new

846
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:13,500
Speaker 1: desktop?".

847
00:43:13,723 --> 00:43:14,919
Speaker 1: It's like it's not going to be right.

848
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:22,358
Speaker 0: So you buy an enablement gadget like someone who's really into novels but isn't technological and doesn't own an e-reader because they wouldn't even think to.

849
00:43:22,378 --> 00:43:23,300
Speaker 0: so you buy them an e-reader.

850
00:43:24,124 --> 00:43:25,400
Speaker 0: But you don't buy them a novel.

851
00:43:25,802 --> 00:43:26,045
Speaker 1: No.

852
00:43:26,673 --> 00:43:27,119
Speaker 1: Can't do that.

853
00:43:27,361 --> 00:43:29,420
Speaker 0: Unless you find an original printing of something.

854
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:29,780
Speaker 1: Yeah.

855
00:43:29,961 --> 00:43:31,367
Speaker 1: You can always get a gift card.

856
00:43:31,407 --> 00:43:35,081
Speaker 1: but I recommend if you have to get a gift card for somebody... No.

857
00:43:35,423 --> 00:43:36,206
Speaker 1: Get a gift card.

858
00:43:36,266 --> 00:43:39,298
Speaker 1: that is specific to a thing you know, right?

859
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,360
Speaker 1: So it's like the Amazon gift card is pretty good.

860
00:43:42,401 --> 00:43:43,440
Speaker 0: It's just cash though.

861
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,558
Speaker 1: That's what I get for people.

862
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:52,054
Speaker 1: But what you can do is you can get, for example, StarWarsShop.com gift cards.

863
00:43:52,074 --> 00:43:52,856
Speaker 1: So it's like, "Alright.

864
00:43:53,217 --> 00:43:54,219
Speaker 1: You're getting a Star Wars

865
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:54,560
Speaker 1: thing.".

866
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,871
Speaker 0: I've always been a fan of getting... If you're going to get someone a gift card, because that's crass.

867
00:43:57,891 --> 00:43:59,877
Speaker 0: That's one step above, "Here's some

868
00:43:59,938 --> 00:44:00,439
Speaker 0: cash.".

869
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:01,218
Speaker 0: That's what I do.

870
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,542
Speaker 0: But not enough cash.

871
00:44:02,562 --> 00:44:03,164
Speaker 0: Because here's the thing.

872
00:44:03,204 --> 00:44:06,030
Speaker 0: If you give someone a lot of cash, that's kind of an awesome gift.

873
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:07,253
Speaker 0: Like, "Hey dude.

874
00:44:07,273 --> 00:44:08,175
Speaker 0: We're really good friends.

875
00:44:08,656 --> 00:44:09,177
Speaker 0: It's your wedding.

876
00:44:09,197 --> 00:44:09,658
Speaker 0: Here's five

877
00:44:09,699 --> 00:44:10,059
Speaker 0: grand.".

878
00:44:11,042 --> 00:44:12,726
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's the other thing, right?

879
00:44:12,966 --> 00:44:15,071
Speaker 1: So if you couldn't buy me a computer, right?

880
00:44:15,492 --> 00:44:18,600
Speaker 1: But if you had five grand, you could not buy a bad computer.

881
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:27,871
Speaker 0: Or if you're buying a gift for a nerd and you have more money than them, the best gift you could give them in that regard is to go to them and say, "Look.

882
00:44:28,692 --> 00:44:32,056
Speaker 0: I don't know a lot about Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

883
00:44:32,076 --> 00:44:33,197
Speaker 0: But what will $5,000

884
00:44:33,197 --> 00:44:33,438
Speaker 0: buy?".

885
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:35,641
Speaker 1: Yeah.

886
00:44:36,182 --> 00:44:38,267
Speaker 1: Asking if no nerd will actually complain.

887
00:44:38,307 --> 00:44:39,128
Speaker 1: if you ask, right?

888
00:44:39,169 --> 00:44:42,335
Speaker 1: I would be like, "Death Star Lego.

889
00:44:42,696 --> 00:44:43,518
Speaker 1: Lego Death Star.

890
00:44:43,578 --> 00:44:43,939
Speaker 1: Can't go

891
00:44:43,979 --> 00:44:44,260
Speaker 1: wrong.".

892
00:44:44,443 --> 00:44:44,658
Speaker 1: Yup.

893
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:45,844
Speaker 1: I'll take it.

894
00:44:46,751 --> 00:44:48,000
Speaker 1: I got nowhere to put it, but I'll take it.

895
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:50,404
Speaker 0: But I'm a big fan if you're going to do the gift card.

896
00:44:50,725 --> 00:44:54,913
Speaker 0: Get a gift card to a store the person would never go to normally.

897
00:44:54,933 --> 00:44:56,255
Speaker 0: Like, never even think to go to.

898
00:44:56,556 --> 00:44:58,820
Speaker 0: Or like a restaurant that they would never think to go to.

899
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:05,247
Speaker 0: And it has to be for a kind of thing that there is no possible way they could use that money for anything practical.

900
00:45:06,128 --> 00:45:08,270
Speaker 0: That way, it's just something frivolous.

901
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:09,812
Speaker 0: Like, go to the crazy steakhouse.

902
00:45:10,172 --> 00:45:16,720
Speaker 0: Or go to, like, I'm trying to think of a store that sells something weird that isn't like the Jellybean store.

903
00:45:17,222 --> 00:45:18,159
Speaker 0: The candle store.

904
00:45:18,761 --> 00:45:20,232
Speaker 0: I don't really want a fucking candle.

905
00:45:20,273 --> 00:45:21,200
Speaker 0: No one wants a candle.

906
00:45:22,326 --> 00:45:23,344
Speaker 1: I saw today- You know what?

907
00:45:23,365 --> 00:45:24,280
Speaker 0: Skydiving lesson.

908
00:45:24,601 --> 00:45:25,140
Speaker 1: That's a good one.

909
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,680
Speaker 0: Like, something crazy like that that they would never think to do.

910
00:45:27,803 --> 00:45:28,158
Speaker 1: Good one.

911
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,414
Speaker 0: My mom got me that a long time ago, actually.

912
00:45:30,434 --> 00:45:30,940
Speaker 0: It was really awesome.

913
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:33,565
Speaker 1: There's a- I saw today on Voing.

914
00:45:33,585 --> 00:45:35,489
Speaker 1: Voing, a candle that is made of chocolate.

915
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:39,700
Speaker 1: You put it in a little cake and you light it and then it melts the chocolate and it becomes a fondant.

916
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:40,081
Speaker 0: Brilliant.

917
00:45:40,966 --> 00:45:41,247
Speaker 0: Brilliant.

918
00:45:41,991 --> 00:45:43,760
Speaker 0: That's a good gift for a fat person.

919
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:45,400
Speaker 1: Chocolate lover.

920
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,169
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can't really go wrong with food, right?

921
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:52,100
Speaker 1: Even if it's not a funeral, I'll take a fruit basket.

922
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:52,916
Speaker 0: So, Scott.

923
00:45:53,281 --> 00:45:53,660
Speaker 1: Gift basket.

924
00:45:53,921 --> 00:45:54,710
Speaker 0: What about our case?

925
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:55,620
Speaker 0: You and me, specifically.

926
00:45:56,704 --> 00:45:58,562
Speaker 1: If you want to get me something- What do you buy for us?

927
00:45:58,642 --> 00:46:11,135
Speaker 0: Because we're, you know, not to brag, but we buy literally everything I want, I either already bought or it's so expensive that- Unless you're a millionaire who wants to like, you know, be the guy who's like, "Yo, dude.

928
00:46:11,316 --> 00:46:11,697
Speaker 0: Here's 10

929
00:46:11,697 --> 00:46:12,038
Speaker 0: grand.".

930
00:46:12,741 --> 00:46:15,015
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, you know, you can get me the Lego Death Star.

931
00:46:15,236 --> 00:46:15,880
Speaker 1: I will not complain.

932
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:16,150
Speaker 1: Huh?

933
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,840
Speaker 0: Lego Superstar and Story, I'll take it.

934
00:46:19,022 --> 00:46:20,294
Speaker 1: You can get me a bigger apartment.

935
00:46:20,335 --> 00:46:20,860
Speaker 0: I will not complain.

936
00:46:21,903 --> 00:46:23,320
Speaker 1: Air hockey table, I will not complain.

937
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:26,073
Speaker 0: I have this extra trouble of, I live in the city.

938
00:46:26,093 --> 00:46:27,499
Speaker 1: I don't have that much space.

939
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,660
Speaker 1: A car with a parking lot, a parking spot, and/or garage?

940
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:33,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, but see, Scott, you realize every gift you're suggesting is something that's ludicrous.

941
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:34,034
Speaker 1: Yup.

942
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:38,260
Speaker 1: So, what do you- Make me something that I didn't know I wanted.

943
00:46:38,722 --> 00:46:43,279
Speaker 1: Yeah, the best gifts I've gotten are- We already discussed that, but yeah, it's pretty much your only option.

944
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,620
Speaker 0: Like, Nuri got me a fantastic scarf.

945
00:46:46,461 --> 00:46:50,057
Speaker 0: Ro got me, actually, a really good bottle of wine that we just drank the other night.

946
00:46:50,177 --> 00:46:50,760
Speaker 0: It was really good.

947
00:46:53,342 --> 00:46:55,350
Speaker 0: Emily gets me random stuff all the time.

948
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:56,394
Speaker 0: that's just awesome.

949
00:46:56,434 --> 00:47:02,879
Speaker 0: Stuff I would never- She gives me a gift, I'm like, "Wow, I never in a million years would have thought to get something like that on my

950
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:03,060
Speaker 0: own.".

951
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:08,700
Speaker 1: Another thing is, there might be something the person likes that's disposable, right?

952
00:47:09,161 --> 00:47:11,540
Speaker 1: And you can always get more, right?

953
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,780
Speaker 0: Yo, dawg, here's a box of condoms.

954
00:47:14,601 --> 00:47:15,617
Speaker 1: I didn't mean it like that.

955
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,127
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

956
00:47:17,147 --> 00:47:19,638
Speaker 1: That's exactly- That's not too bad, though, right?

957
00:47:20,102 --> 00:47:22,600
Speaker 1: Or it's something that you can never have enough of, right?

958
00:47:22,982 --> 00:47:23,839
Speaker 1: Here's some RAM.

959
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:27,380
Speaker 1: Right, so before it was like, you know, Imagine the Gathering cards, right?

960
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:34,759
Speaker 1: You can just buy someone a fucking box of them and it's like- Yeah, if someone's into collectible games, boosters will never, ever-.

961
00:47:35,504 --> 00:47:36,390
Speaker 1: You like miniatures?

962
00:47:36,592 --> 00:47:37,780
Speaker 1: Can't hurt to have more paint.

963
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:38,550
Speaker 0: Yeah.

964
00:47:39,421 --> 00:47:42,640
Speaker 0: No, no, no, already you might buy the wrong kind of paint.

965
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:46,839
Speaker 0: Because if you're painting Warhammer 40k and you get him the wrong paint, nope, nope.

966
00:47:47,161 --> 00:47:49,189
Speaker 1: But, you know, it couldn't hurt.

967
00:47:49,229 --> 00:47:51,740
Speaker 1: Here, here's a freaking, you know, here's a whole bunch of minis.

968
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:55,073
Speaker 0: Oh, great, some Fallen Empires boosters.

969
00:47:55,133 --> 00:47:56,640
Speaker 0: Those aren't legal in any tournament.

970
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:57,417
Speaker 1: I'm just saying.

971
00:47:57,761 --> 00:47:58,848
Speaker 0: And they're not valuable.

972
00:47:58,868 --> 00:48:00,680
Speaker 0: Because of my Fallen Empires.

973
00:48:01,101 --> 00:48:01,660
Speaker 1: It's better than nothing.

974
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:03,956
Speaker 0: Oh, great, they're even in Italian because he didn't know better.

975
00:48:04,138 --> 00:48:04,420
Speaker 0: Thanks.

976
00:48:04,461 --> 00:48:05,380
Speaker 1: That's actually kind of cool.

977
00:48:05,762 --> 00:48:06,138
Speaker 1: Thanks, Grandma.

978
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,166
Speaker 1: You couldn't do worse.

979
00:48:07,488 --> 00:48:09,019
Speaker 1: You could do worse, is what I'm- you know.

980
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:11,334
Speaker 0: I think I want to say something.

981
00:48:11,354 --> 00:48:13,247
Speaker 1: You have to avoid- Or like, you know, it's like Lego.

982
00:48:13,468 --> 00:48:15,336
Speaker 1: Just buy him a whole fucking bucket of Lego.

983
00:48:15,618 --> 00:48:16,100
Speaker 1: More Lego.

984
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,289
Speaker 0: This is getting back to the early.

985
00:48:18,631 --> 00:48:20,760
Speaker 0: But, uh, you have to avoid traps.

986
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:24,280
Speaker 0: If you're buying something for someone, like, gaming is a great example.

987
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,438
Speaker 0: How many of you- Can't have more dice.

988
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:35,760
Speaker 0: How many of you have Grandma bought you a Game Boy Advance game and it's like- Yeah, right?

989
00:48:36,141 --> 00:48:40,820
Speaker 1: Like, I mean, how many kids, you know- Because they went to Gamestop and took the advice of the Gamestop employee.

990
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:43,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Gamestop guys, like, you know, they heard of Nintendogs.

991
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:47,038
Speaker 1: My grandma bought me Ninja Turtles 2 Arcade Edition for NES.

992
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:58,619
Speaker 0: But I'm saying, there was a whole industry around things that are traps for nerd- for people who are buying gifts for people who are into a thing who don't know about that thing.

993
00:48:59,341 --> 00:49:02,880
Speaker 0: And that is exemplified by the Petz series, because that existed.

994
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:09,138
Speaker 0: Dogs was nothing more than to trick grandmas who didn't realize that Nintendogs- Was sold out.

995
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,880
Speaker 0: Was the name of the game.

996
00:49:11,001 --> 00:49:13,934
Speaker 0: So they go to the store and say, "I need that dog game for the

997
00:49:13,974 --> 00:49:14,597
Speaker 0: Nintendo.".

998
00:49:15,381 --> 00:49:20,860
Speaker 0: And the canny employee of Gamestop says, "Here is the high margin dogs game.

999
00:49:21,602 --> 00:49:23,014
Speaker 0: It is the Nintendo dogs

1000
00:49:23,074 --> 00:49:23,437
Speaker 0: game.".

1001
00:49:23,907 --> 00:49:24,119
Speaker 0: Yep.

1002
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,060
Speaker 0: Because it is the dogs game on Nintendo.

1003
00:49:26,301 --> 00:49:26,840
Speaker 1: It is a dog game.

1004
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:28,774
Speaker 0: And the kid opens it and says, "Thanks,

1005
00:49:28,814 --> 00:49:29,258
Speaker 0: Grandma.".

1006
00:49:30,144 --> 00:49:31,274
Speaker 0: And then tweets, "Fuck you,

1007
00:49:31,334 --> 00:49:31,738
Speaker 0: Grandma.".

1008
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:33,596
Speaker 1: And Daryl Swart retweets it.

1009
00:49:34,783 --> 00:49:36,180
Speaker 0: And then the circle of life is complete.

1010
00:49:36,361 --> 00:49:36,678
Speaker 0: That's right.

1011
00:49:37,001 --> 00:49:50,679
Speaker 0: So if you're buying a gift for someone who is a nerd and you don't know about it- Be very, very wary of things that are traps- That are literally trying to steal money from people who are exactly like you.

1012
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:54,674
Speaker 0: When in doubt, find another nerd of that thing and be like, "Is this a

1013
00:49:54,714 --> 00:49:54,996
Speaker 0: trap?"

1014
00:49:56,022 --> 00:49:56,426
Speaker 0: "Is this an

1015
00:49:56,587 --> 00:49:57,072
Speaker 0: Akbar?"

1016
00:49:58,145 --> 00:49:58,920
Speaker 0: In the vernacular.

1017
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:07,090
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1018
00:50:07,211 --> 00:50:12,210
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1019

00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:20,550
