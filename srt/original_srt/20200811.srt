1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,631
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday August 11th 2020.

2
00:00:11,631 --> 00:00:12,072
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,614 --> 00:00:14,359
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:14,379 --> 00:00:18,591
Speaker 0: tonight We're gonna talk about the tabletop game modern art and how to win.

5
00:00:18,771 --> 00:00:21,238
Speaker 0: It's because we are very good at it.

6
00:00:23,002 --> 00:00:25,505
Speaker 1: Let's do this still.

7
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:32,846
Speaker 0: uh still stuck at home, but I've basically like I said I've been trying to really like up my Physical training and exercise.

8
00:00:32,886 --> 00:00:36,160
Speaker 0: cuz going outside to exercise alone is like the one thing I can actually do.

9
00:00:36,741 --> 00:00:43,140
Speaker 0: So Saturday ran half marathon Sunday biked a hundred miles and Monday my body was a little bit like yo dawg.

10
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:47,379
Speaker 1: You're almost 40 cool it Yeah, so who cares about that?

11
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:57,691
Speaker 1: The New York Rangers have won in some sort of miraculous twist of fate Despite the drop that should have cursed a sea cursed drop.

12
00:00:57,771 --> 00:01:00,197
Speaker 1: Alright, so you got to understand how crazy this is, right?

13
00:01:00,257 --> 00:01:17,222
Speaker 1: So in Earlier in the hockey season right there was a hockey game in which Carolina had to bring in a backup goalie not just the regular backup goalie But the emergency backup goalie who was a zamboni driver and they end up winning that game Right.

14
00:01:17,925 --> 00:01:22,946
Speaker 1: the effect of that win on the standings is such that Right.

15
00:01:23,852 --> 00:01:32,596
Speaker 1: if they had not won that game It is likely that you know some other team would have had the first overall draft pick.

16
00:01:32,917 --> 00:01:34,100
Speaker 1: right that one game.

17
00:01:34,301 --> 00:01:37,340
Speaker 0: Oh, there's so many so many like moments.

18
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,586
Speaker 0: But that one was the one I saw everyone talking about.

19
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:48,020
Speaker 1: if the season had continued in normal fashion and there was not some horrible Earth, you know shaking pandemic, right?

20
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:55,820
Speaker 1: The Rangers probably would have gone on to do You know too well this season to get that many lottery balls and end up with the first overall

21
00:01:56,462 --> 00:02:01,580
Speaker 0: Like not out of the realm would have won the wild card race lost the first round of the playoffs and then right

22
00:02:02,471 --> 00:02:04,043
Speaker 1: pretty much So.

23
00:02:04,726 --> 00:02:08,500
Speaker 1: but instead what ended up happening is they did the lottery picks, right?

24
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,418
Speaker 1: But because they had these play-in games, right?

25
00:02:13,862 --> 00:02:18,540
Speaker 1: You know into the for the play for the playoffs, which this is good game design talk to remember.

26
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:26,161
Speaker 0: They had to design how they're gonna do The like finish the end of the season to figure out who's actually in the playoffs with this weird format Like.

27
00:02:26,322 --> 00:02:27,926
Speaker 0: yep, this was game design straight up.

28
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:47,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, so they came up with this format and the they it was randomly determined right that You know one of the eight teams That was going to lose in the play-in round ended up winning the first overall draft pick.

29
00:02:47,805 --> 00:02:49,338
Speaker 1: Detroit got shoved down to like.

30
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:51,944
Speaker 0: Such a Detroit.

31
00:02:52,284 --> 00:02:53,889
Speaker 0: if anyone needs good draft picks.

32
00:02:53,929 --> 00:02:54,831
Speaker 0: It's Detroit right now.

33
00:02:55,232 --> 00:02:56,857
Speaker 0: This is like the second dead wings era.

34
00:02:57,679 --> 00:03:02,875
Speaker 1: Yeah Which is you know, I guess, you know it to prevent tanking right?

35
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:11,010
Speaker 0: This is this is what you do Yeah Cuz if they just said whoever came in last in the season got like the first pick The end of every NHL season would be a real.

36
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:16,795
Speaker 0: you'd see like the Sabres and the Red Wings like Refusing to score on each other and infinite overtimes.

37
00:03:17,378 --> 00:03:20,914
Speaker 1: Yep I don't know at the players might be too proud to do that.

38
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:25,199
Speaker 0: I Feel like some teams would get to the point where enough they would not be too proud.

39
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,800
Speaker 1: Regardless, so it was randomly determined.

40
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:31,971
Speaker 1: So the odds of this or happening to begin with were very low.

41
00:03:32,032 --> 00:03:35,026
Speaker 1: right that one of the eight teams was gonna end up with The first pick.

42
00:03:35,127 --> 00:03:37,664
Speaker 1: not one of these, you know Teams that didn't what.

43
00:03:37,925 --> 00:03:45,360
Speaker 1: the teams that didn't even make it to the play-in games the teams that just you know Stayed home and as soon as the virus hit we're just done for the season.

44
00:03:45,922 --> 00:03:47,930
Speaker 1: those teams did not get the first overall pick.

45
00:03:48,573 --> 00:04:01,105
Speaker 1: one of the eight teams had it and There's basically a one in eight chance like roll it You know take a d8 Say I'm gonna roll a one roll a one that and the first roll and that those are the odds 12.5% chance of any one team.

46
00:04:03,963 --> 00:04:07,867
Speaker 0: Think of it like if they did a lottery But they hadn't sold the tickets yet.

47
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:13,606
Speaker 0: and then the lottery happened and we knew the winning ticket was in this one storm But we didn't know which ticket.

48
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:17,160
Speaker 1: so, you know, they took eight lottery.

49
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:23,883
Speaker 1: But after the eight teams after the eight play-in, you know series were done and the Rangers got swept Destroyed.

50
00:04:24,065 --> 00:04:24,813
Speaker 1: it was embarrassing.

51
00:04:24,873 --> 00:04:26,099
Speaker 0: It was a disaster.

52
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,899
Speaker 1: Disgraceful, right totally blown out, but it doesn't matter how much you lost you lost right?

53
00:04:32,842 --> 00:04:34,489
Speaker 1: There were eight teams that lost right?

54
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:39,384
Speaker 1: There was Rangers Leafs Wild heart not hurricanes.

55
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:39,826
Speaker 1: They beat us.

56
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:45,499
Speaker 1: Yeah leaves wild a jets eat penguins penguins in there, right?

57
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,965
Speaker 1: Florida Panthers, right.

58
00:04:48,427 --> 00:04:51,700
Speaker 1: any any one of these eight teams had an equal chance, right?

59
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,294
Speaker 1: Could you imagine if the like already still good penguins or Leafs got?

60
00:04:56,354 --> 00:04:58,180
Speaker 1: it's like that would have been the worst thing ever, right?

61
00:05:00,162 --> 00:05:07,712
Speaker 1: And so they go to do this lottery and since it's a simple d8 situation They don't have to do what they usually do with the book full of numbers.

62
00:05:07,732 --> 00:05:09,920
Speaker 1: or you know different teams have different odds.

63
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,445
Speaker 1: It was just a one out of eight chance.

64
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,553
Speaker 1: They made eight special balls.

65
00:05:13,593 --> 00:05:15,600
Speaker 1: that a team logos on them, right?

66
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:21,410
Speaker 1: They put the eight balls into a lottery ball machine and they picked one ball And if your team logo came out at the top, that was it.

67
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,415
Speaker 1: You got it, right?

68
00:05:22,817 --> 00:05:23,440
Speaker 1: You don't got it.

69
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:32,536
Speaker 1: Well, you're picking somewhere between like, you know ninth and who knows where way down there I just googled Rangers ball dropped and what's up at the top is rigged trending on Twitter.

70
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:38,420
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah No, so the dude he's got the dude from Ernst and Young right who is like prepared.

71
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:43,719
Speaker 1: You know the auditors who prepared these perfectly fair balls in the and the machine and everything, right?

72
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:49,379
Speaker 1: You know, they opens up the special case with the with the balls in it.

73
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,583
Speaker 1: It's a good case out.

74
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:52,750
Speaker 1: He takes the balls out one at a time.

75
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:55,600
Speaker 1: So the Commissioner can verify with his eyeball.

76
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,220
Speaker 0: I love his like stone face like he holds each one up like multiple angers angles to each camera.

77
00:06:00,301 --> 00:06:01,371
Speaker 0: He doesn't react like the.

78
00:06:01,391 --> 00:06:02,360
Speaker 0: I was just stone face.

79
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,736
Speaker 1: Yes He's showing showing the Commissioner of the balls and showing the whole world because it's on video.

80
00:06:06,896 --> 00:06:09,120
Speaker 1: right each ball Right the whole thing.

81
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:16,999
Speaker 1: You can watch the video of the whole thing to see that no shenanigans happened Except he holds up each ball one at a time to verify before putting them into the slot, right?

82
00:06:18,262 --> 00:06:19,408
Speaker 1: It takes out the Rangers ball.

83
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:29,123
Speaker 1: He drops it prematurely Prematurely drops the ball and I'm like, of course the one ball he prematurely drops is gonna be all right Of course.

84
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:32,655
Speaker 1: and then he takes it out again because the hasn't been visually verified.

85
00:06:33,197 --> 00:06:34,060
Speaker 1: that puts it back in.

86
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,984
Speaker 1: So it's the only ball.

87
00:06:35,004 --> 00:06:36,571
Speaker 1: he touches twice every other ball.

88
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:48,326
Speaker 1: He touches one time Right, and then if you watch it in slow motion, it's like you can see like the maple leafs ball like bumping our ball like up into the Right.

89
00:06:49,112 --> 00:06:53,940
Speaker 1: I did not notice that You got to watch the slow-mo video, but it's like this one in eight chance.

90
00:06:54,241 --> 00:07:01,289
Speaker 1: It's like and not the one ball that was touched twice ends up Miraculously being the one that gets the way sports goes.

91
00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:04,379
Speaker 0: really fair lottery machine because we won the draft.

92
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:06,909
Speaker 0: now It was rigged but had we lost it.

93
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,073
Speaker 0: We would have been cursed.

94
00:07:08,355 --> 00:07:09,057
Speaker 0: That's how they think.

95
00:07:09,077 --> 00:07:09,680
Speaker 1: there were threads.

96
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:19,320
Speaker 1: There were threads online all week Basically showing how no matter which of the eight teams won you could easily make an argument for why it was rigged.

97
00:07:19,561 --> 00:07:20,184
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they had.

98
00:07:20,446 --> 00:07:32,580
Speaker 1: they had prepared copy pastas for all eight Of course in advance and then of course as soon as we won People went and found the Rangers copy pasta that was prepared in advance and started posting it, right?

99
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,165
Speaker 0: Yeah, but now it's exciting cuz.

100
00:07:34,185 --> 00:07:38,781
Speaker 0: now the real question is gonna be so we're gonna get up this first draft pick Don't?

101
00:07:38,801 --> 00:07:39,184
Speaker 0: we have like.

102
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:41,419
Speaker 0: we have another first round pick too because of the trades.

103
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:44,003
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we have.

104
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,792
Speaker 1: so you need Carolina to lose quickly.

105
00:07:46,852 --> 00:07:49,280
Speaker 1: they just destroyed us right which is good if they had.

106
00:07:51,635 --> 00:07:54,680
Speaker 1: But We need care that we're gonna get Carolina's pick, right?

107
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,366
Speaker 1: So if Carolina wins at all, we're getting.

108
00:07:56,386 --> 00:07:59,700
Speaker 1: we're picking last with that one right at least last in the first round.

109
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,389
Speaker 1: We're just still not.

110
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:03,971
Speaker 1: it's still first round Yeah, but we want them to lose like right away.

111
00:08:04,031 --> 00:08:07,238
Speaker 1: that way that pick will be earlier right.

112
00:08:08,242 --> 00:08:09,533
Speaker 0: So we'll see what this team looks like.

113
00:08:09,553 --> 00:08:10,380
Speaker 0: cuz the Rangers are weird.

114
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,575
Speaker 0: They're like they were getting better and better over the course of the season.

115
00:08:13,595 --> 00:08:18,340
Speaker 0: the season got cut short And then when they went into this play in they were bad again.

116
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,920
Speaker 0: But they got a little bit better over the course of those three terrible terrible games.

117
00:08:24,522 --> 00:08:28,800
Speaker 0: Of course, I don't know if I'll even be hockey in 2021 like I feel like we might have to skip a year.

118
00:08:30,525 --> 00:08:31,278
Speaker 0: We'll see how things go.

119
00:08:32,662 --> 00:08:36,188
Speaker 0: So in some other gaming news There's a game out there.

120
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:37,760
Speaker 0: I have not played it like full disclosure.

121
00:08:37,981 --> 00:08:40,772
Speaker 0: I don't know if I will based on what other people have been saying about it.

122
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:42,659
Speaker 0: That is it's okay, but it's not great.

123
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:49,040
Speaker 0: but Fall guys has been moderately popular because it's like an online game that a bunch of people can play.

124
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,340
Speaker 0: It's really accessible really simple and I saw a lot.

125
00:08:52,742 --> 00:08:55,920
Speaker 1: I just watched some video of this game or some streams of it.

126
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,726
Speaker 1: You can see what it's all about.

127
00:08:57,806 --> 00:09:00,897
Speaker 1: pretty it's pretty straightforward and it does look pretty fun.

128
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:01,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, it looks it looks.

129
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,092
Speaker 1: I just I just don't know if I'm gonna get into it.

130
00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:05,480
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is be too late.

131
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:13,847
Speaker 0: I feel like fall guys would be way more fun at a convention or on a couch with a whole bunch of people Like among friends.

132
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:15,294
Speaker 1: the thing is it's like a battle royale.

133
00:09:15,314 --> 00:09:16,420
Speaker 1: We need like a hundred people.

134
00:09:16,481 --> 00:09:18,257
Speaker 1: I don't think it'd be fun with like ten people.

135
00:09:18,277 --> 00:09:21,840
Speaker 1: I don't know The probably a hundred people kind of situation.

136
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,046
Speaker 0: Yeah Well imagine like a room.

137
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:28,524
Speaker 0: it like a PAX where everyone in the room or a theater like everyone in the main theaters just play In this game.

138
00:09:28,584 --> 00:09:29,129
Speaker 0: Yeah, they'll.

139
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:30,520
Speaker 1: probably they could do something like that.

140
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's a magic conventions doing that.

141
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,440
Speaker 0: the game seems to have gotten more popular than anyone expected.

142
00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:37,166
Speaker 0: So it doesn't have.

143
00:09:37,186 --> 00:09:41,320
Speaker 0: despite being an online game where people are ostensibly competing to win like ortho game.

144
00:09:42,242 --> 00:09:45,671
Speaker 0: It is not like set up to have things like.

145
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:47,797
Speaker 0: you can't report other players for things.

146
00:09:48,358 --> 00:09:49,000
Speaker 1: I didn't know about that.

147
00:09:49,271 --> 00:09:59,640
Speaker 0: Yeah like it doesn't have a lot of the things that games like this would normally have and one of the things that does not have is Any way to prevent cheating and people are cheating like crazy in this.

148
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,145
Speaker 1: Well, so the first thing.

149
00:10:01,165 --> 00:10:09,635
Speaker 1: so when this game came out the first thing I heard about it was that they had the usual Going live on the first day and their internet their multiplayer two servers are failing.

150
00:10:09,695 --> 00:10:12,086
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was the first story I heard about this game.

151
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:15,955
Speaker 1: the second story I heard about this game Is that streamers are streaming it like crazy.

152
00:10:15,995 --> 00:10:16,640
Speaker 1: come look at it?

153
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,040
Speaker 1: And I went and looked at it and saw that it actually looked kind of fun.

154
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,066
Speaker 1: Yeah, right and so forth.

155
00:10:20,107 --> 00:10:22,120
Speaker 0: I earmarked it as I play this at some point.

156
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:26,523
Speaker 1: Yeah the third thing I heard about it was that some people were basically Trolling.

157
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:34,199
Speaker 1: so they'll be like races in the game and it's like as long as you get you know Make the cut in the race you go to the next round and you're not eliminated, right?

158
00:10:35,481 --> 00:10:43,237
Speaker 1: So people will race and if they finish early enough will stop at the finish line Turn around and just like interfere with other players.

159
00:10:43,298 --> 00:10:43,619
Speaker 1: That's cool.

160
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:49,219
Speaker 1: I like that and then when they're getting closer to the cut will turn around and cross the finish line.

161
00:10:50,261 --> 00:10:56,017
Speaker 1: So there's a lot of trolling kind of griefing behavior involved going on in the game, which is good and bad.

162
00:10:56,198 --> 00:11:06,637
Speaker 0: Yep It's more good than bad in a game like this because this is not a like Mario Kart Fox-only final destination situation like turn off all the items.

163
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:10,220
Speaker 1: also It can still be kind of frustrating depending on the specifics.

164
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:16,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, but this game is also like super loose control like like barely able to control your character game.

165
00:11:16,901 --> 00:11:22,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then the last thing I heard about it as rim said is that apparently cheating is now rampant in this game.

166
00:11:23,321 --> 00:11:28,617
Speaker 0: Yeah, like some of it's just like glitches like you can start people can start running before the gun goes off.

167
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:30,062
Speaker 0: people can just teleport To the end.

168
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:34,940
Speaker 0: I watched one streamer who was like way ahead of the pack and like really excited.

169
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:47,195
Speaker 0: There's this whole thing going on and then he gets to the end and there's like three people Already there who had teleported to the end at the start of the match and we're just waiting for someone to see before they went over the finish line.

170
00:11:48,147 --> 00:11:55,900
Speaker 1: Yep, so So yeah, I probably you know, it's it's I think the core does idea of this game that you know as it was designed.

171
00:11:56,041 --> 00:12:00,000
Speaker 1: It's like very very clever, you know, it's so basic.

172
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,105
Speaker 1: It obviously didn't take.

173
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:02,872
Speaker 1: you know, I mean, I'm sure it wasn't like.

174
00:12:02,892 --> 00:12:06,205
Speaker 1: I'm not saying it was super easy to make this game Right, but relatively speaking.

175
00:12:06,245 --> 00:12:06,526
Speaker 1: It didn't.

176
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:10,820
Speaker 1: it wasn't a triple-a budget super long difficult development, right?

177
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:14,680
Speaker 1: It's you know, it's a pretty relatively straightforward game, right?

178
00:12:15,603 --> 00:12:17,740
Speaker 1: But you know such ingenious and unique.

179
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:29,097
Speaker 1: They're the first ones to combine the battle royale with sort of like the monkey ball plus sort of the overwah Overcooked kind of a little bit right is like sometimes his teamwork involved.

180
00:12:29,157 --> 00:12:33,676
Speaker 1: It's like, okay We're gonna split you all into teams and each team has to push a ball through an obstacle course.

181
00:12:33,696 --> 00:12:34,700
Speaker 1: a little bit of Marvel Madness.

182
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:36,604
Speaker 0: People were complaining.

183
00:12:36,624 --> 00:12:41,160
Speaker 0: There's one minigame that was very hard and people were really mad about that one and never wanted to see it.

184
00:12:42,189 --> 00:12:45,953
Speaker 1: Yeah Regardless, you know, it's it's unique combination.

185
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:46,355
Speaker 1: I like it.

186
00:12:46,476 --> 00:12:47,340
Speaker 1: I like the concept.

187
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:47,883
Speaker 1: It's just.

188
00:12:47,924 --> 00:12:50,360
Speaker 1: you know, this is problem after problem after problem.

189
00:12:50,581 --> 00:13:02,452
Speaker 1: Clearly something here part of which part of which is caused by you know not lack of polish in the game itself and part of which is caused by Two more people playing it than they expected sort of what happened to zoom.

190
00:13:02,633 --> 00:13:04,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, where it's like, oh we have shitty software.

191
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,531
Speaker 1: Oh, no, too many people are using the shitty software.

192
00:13:07,692 --> 00:13:13,560
Speaker 1: It has broken under the weight of user So it actually hits teams top five.

193
00:13:14,324 --> 00:13:15,047
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

194
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:19,326
Speaker 0: It's broken under, you know, here's a question for you users What do you think is above?

195
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:23,480
Speaker 0: fall guys on Steam right now, I'm not looking at it right now.

196
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:23,881
Speaker 0: Yeah, like.

197
00:13:23,941 --> 00:13:29,000
Speaker 0: well if you had to guess I'm just curious if you're on tapped in that cuz hop games on Steam.

198
00:13:29,181 --> 00:13:29,381
Speaker 0: I am.

199
00:13:29,602 --> 00:13:31,288
Speaker 1: I'm looking at the list always up there.

200
00:13:31,328 --> 00:13:31,649
Speaker 1: Don't it?

201
00:13:31,669 --> 00:13:32,331
Speaker 1: Who's usually?

202
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:33,615
Speaker 0: yes go Dota 2.

203
00:13:33,615 --> 00:13:34,498
Speaker 0: Okay.

204
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:34,860
Speaker 1: I got two.

205
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,104
Speaker 1: I'm that's doing pretty good.

206
00:13:36,164 --> 00:13:36,405
Speaker 1: Yep.

207
00:13:36,847 --> 00:13:37,710
Speaker 0: There's only two more.

208
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,216
Speaker 1: It's only two more.

209
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:40,220
Speaker 0: the fifth the fourth one.

210
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:40,883
Speaker 0: I did not.

211
00:13:40,943 --> 00:13:43,273
Speaker 0: I would never imagined in a million years GTA 5.

212
00:13:43,273 --> 00:13:47,568
Speaker 0: Oh I didn't think that many people were playing that.

213
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:50,257
Speaker 1: Oh, this has to be like an online multiplayer game.

214
00:13:50,317 --> 00:13:53,485
Speaker 1: Yeah I don't know.

215
00:13:53,505 --> 00:13:53,807
Speaker 1: I give up.

216
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:54,371
Speaker 0: It's pub G.

217
00:13:54,391 --> 00:13:56,347
Speaker 1: Oh Dad, that makes yep.

218
00:13:56,367 --> 00:13:57,013
Speaker 0: That's the obvious one.

219
00:13:57,033 --> 00:13:57,900
Speaker 0: via GTA 5.

220
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,660
Speaker 0: I did not but as I apparently there is no way to report anyone for cheating.

221
00:14:02,982 --> 00:14:06,160
Speaker 0: Nor does the company have like any resources to do anything about the cheating?

222
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:06,921
Speaker 0: What they're?

223
00:14:06,941 --> 00:14:17,239
Speaker 0: they ask people like oh if you see a cheater come into our discord and tell us that ain't gonna fly No Like I said, it's fallen under the weight of more users than expect.

224
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,115
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I think it's gonna be a flash in the pan and die pretty quick.

225
00:14:20,135 --> 00:14:20,920
Speaker 0: So I don't think I'm right.

226
00:14:21,121 --> 00:14:21,766
Speaker 1: I don't know if it'll.

227
00:14:22,008 --> 00:14:27,080
Speaker 1: I don't know if it'll die, you know I think when you have that maybe it'll from the all sales to a steady.

228
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:31,155
Speaker 1: You can boost yourself up right with all that money like zoom has right?

229
00:14:31,235 --> 00:14:32,541
Speaker 0: I think the problem part of the problem This

230
00:14:32,601 --> 00:14:45,411
Speaker 1: is the thing is right is this see we're the kind of people right where if we came up with this idea Right, we would foresee all of these problems and Foreseeing those problems

231
00:14:45,432 --> 00:14:47,022
Speaker 0: decide not to make the game We

232
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:52,580
Speaker 1: would either decide not to make it or decide not to release it until we've solved all the problems.

233
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:52,773
Speaker 1: Yeah.

234
00:14:53,081 --> 00:14:58,320
Speaker 1: And then we would not release and we'd get beaten by this kind of but by actual fog.

235
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,190
Speaker 0: We would have made the same mistakes that video ball made.

236
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:11,320
Speaker 1: I think right and I think this is what happens With pretty much all not just video games, right but all successful multiplayer software.

237
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:18,600
Speaker 1: You look at you know, things like friggin Twitter and Facebook and you know, pretty much everything right Google, right?

238
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,362
Speaker 1: and it's like.

239
00:15:19,402 --> 00:15:21,289
Speaker 1: people are always complaining about these things.

240
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,458
Speaker 1: and it's like because they have all these problems.

241
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:29,326
Speaker 1: and it's like Yeah, because the way to succeed is to release a thing that gets the job done But it's full of problems.

242
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:36,035
Speaker 1: if you solve all the problems before you put your product out there You'll never put your product out there and you'll never be the winner, right.

243
00:15:36,276 --> 00:15:37,120
Speaker 1: and then it people.

244
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:41,914
Speaker 1: Yeah, no one's complaining about your perfect product that never got released and took ten years and that's just.

245
00:15:42,015 --> 00:15:43,740
Speaker 1: it's a software problem.

246
00:15:45,784 --> 00:15:55,188
Speaker 1: So I feel like there is something here though I don't think there's a way to make a price off a piece of software with a Incredibly large number of users.

247
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,994
Speaker 0: now that is a unique constraint.

248
00:15:57,636 --> 00:16:11,999
Speaker 1: that is problem that public users right not private business users, but like public users that is Simultaneously doesn't have people complaining about it and also successful.

249
00:16:14,023 --> 00:16:21,905
Speaker 0: So yeah, you can read the details here But I don't know if I'll be playing this because it seems like the skill cap is very low and the game is kind of Just ran to me really.

250
00:16:21,925 --> 00:16:23,331
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the kind of game.

251
00:16:23,371 --> 00:16:23,552
Speaker 1: It is.

252
00:16:23,572 --> 00:16:25,139
Speaker 1: It's like a fun party kind of situation.

253
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:31,009
Speaker 0: I feel like what the game I want is basically WarioWare.

254
00:16:31,071 --> 00:16:33,220
Speaker 0: this Like.

255
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,887
Speaker 0: I want massively online WarioWare.

256
00:16:36,188 --> 00:16:44,629
Speaker 0: like 10,000 people are doing that dancing game in the old GameCube WarioWare Until eventually one person's left go.

257
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:47,960
Speaker 0: make it now somehow how I foresee all these problems with it.

258
00:16:49,782 --> 00:16:52,192
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think people are gonna cheat and grief at that.

259
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:53,336
Speaker 1: What are you gonna do about it?

260
00:16:53,457 --> 00:16:54,200
Speaker 0: I'd let him grief.

261
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,184
Speaker 0: I just wouldn't let him cheat.

262
00:16:55,204 --> 00:16:56,067
Speaker 0: Yeah.

263
00:16:56,087 --> 00:17:00,003
Speaker 0: Well, I feel like it looks like some of the cheating here is like Exploits.

264
00:17:00,143 --> 00:17:04,319
Speaker 0: some of it might be fucking with API is like I. I don't know.

265
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:08,612
Speaker 0: I haven't looked into it that much I don't care that much but I think this could have been handled a lot better.

266
00:17:08,973 --> 00:17:10,480
Speaker 0: But again the game did well.

267
00:17:10,882 --> 00:17:11,465
Speaker 0: It's popular.

268
00:17:11,486 --> 00:17:12,290
Speaker 0: It's still popular.

269
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,839
Speaker 0: People are still playing it despite the cheaters.

270
00:17:16,029 --> 00:17:16,678
Speaker 0: So you got any news?

271
00:17:18,161 --> 00:17:18,884
Speaker 1: Do I have a news?

272
00:17:18,944 --> 00:17:29,759
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there's a lot of news coming out and like the board game land Because you know all the board game conventions didn't happen Right and Gen cons and things like that would be around this time.

273
00:17:31,281 --> 00:17:36,420
Speaker 1: So because of that right there's instead all the new people still making board games, right?

274
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,534
Speaker 1: The the virus doesn't prevent board game development.

275
00:17:39,574 --> 00:17:40,739
Speaker 1: In fact, it probably speeds it up.

276
00:17:40,961 --> 00:17:48,479
Speaker 1: You have more time to sit at home and work on their board games Or tabletop RPGs or whatever it is, you know tabletop stuff in general.

277
00:17:50,026 --> 00:17:51,844
Speaker 1: so There's plenty there.

278
00:17:51,884 --> 00:17:58,270
Speaker 1: I you know, there were some video game news as I saw but that was I didn't know enough about them To really talk about them, but plenty of tabletop news.

279
00:17:58,632 --> 00:18:07,734
Speaker 1: and one that really caught my eye Right was this announcement of a new dune board game, you know Because the existing dune board games kind of legendary and infamous in various ways.

280
00:18:07,774 --> 00:18:11,745
Speaker 1: We talked about it on the show before But here's a new dune board game.

281
00:18:12,187 --> 00:18:20,920
Speaker 1: That is the has the official dune license dune theme right which other Like, you know has not been available for other games that recently.

282
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:26,299
Speaker 1: But It's not anything like the old dune game.

283
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:35,920
Speaker 1: It is instead a deck building worker placement game made by the people who made clank Which is maybe one of the better deck building games.

284
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,459
Speaker 1: That's not dominion because they're most of the deck building games that aren't dominion or poop Yeah, so usually when you see a deck builder and it's not dominion you're like, eh

285
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe if the deck building is like a minor component of another game like slay the spire

286
00:18:49,528 --> 00:19:02,670
Speaker 1: Yep, but Regardless, there's a dune themed right board game coming out that is a worker placement game and a deck builder, which is I guess you know a Combo of two things that are like peanut butter and jelly.

287
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,239
Speaker 0: here is literally all that we know about it.

288
00:19:06,621 --> 00:19:08,788
Speaker 0: Do you want the entire power of the universe?

289
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:13,020
Speaker 0: and then it says deck building these worker placement talk about spice, right?

290
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:17,639
Speaker 0: Yep, deck building meets worker placement in a new board game of galactic struggle.

291
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:17,900
Speaker 0: That's it.

292
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,900
Speaker 0: There's always a video trailer and it's 30 seconds long.

293
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,821
Speaker 0: That's all it says.

294
00:19:23,242 --> 00:19:34,940
Speaker 1: right and dire wolf digital who is maybe the best company at making You know digital editions of board games they make they're making the roots digital root digital edition.

295
00:19:35,482 --> 00:19:39,739
Speaker 1: They made the yellow and yanxi digital edition, which is he works fine.

296
00:19:40,341 --> 00:19:42,730
Speaker 1: Perper, you know has very few issues.

297
00:19:42,751 --> 00:19:44,999
Speaker 1: It's not perfect, but it's pretty damn close to it.

298
00:19:46,705 --> 00:19:47,956
Speaker 1: And they're involved in this game.

299
00:19:48,057 --> 00:19:53,996
Speaker 1: so If you like dune if you like deck building or worker placement if you like clank, right.

300
00:19:54,016 --> 00:20:04,520
Speaker 0: if you like clank the game That's all I can imagine is because clank is all about go into the dungeon like that old infiltration game steal loot get out Before everyone else or get out and hope you don't die like a push.

301
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,280
Speaker 1: This game is probably gonna be about making a deck that gets you the most spice before the game ends.

302
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:18,671
Speaker 0: The whole premise of clank is like clank is every time you make noises The Dragons more likely to wake up and kill everybody.

303
00:20:18,732 --> 00:20:24,819
Speaker 0: kind of like how we know the Russian kind of like that worm Yeah, or like in the filtration you set off the alarm too many times cops show up.

304
00:20:25,161 --> 00:20:28,875
Speaker 0: So in this game, I feel like the clank is literally walk without rhythm.

305
00:20:29,196 --> 00:20:30,280
Speaker 0: So you don't attract the worm.

306
00:20:30,903 --> 00:20:32,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's probably what it's gonna be.

307
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:34,439
Speaker 0: I could feel that I could feel that real hard.

308
00:20:35,263 --> 00:20:37,235
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this this is promised.

309
00:20:37,295 --> 00:20:37,919
Speaker 1: keep your eye on it.

310
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,092
Speaker 0: Well, like storm and worm cards are like curses too many.

311
00:20:41,132 --> 00:20:43,160
Speaker 0: call pair in your hand and then bullshit happens.

312
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:47,400
Speaker 1: I'm cautiously put a worker you put a worker to go gather water or whatever.

313
00:20:47,641 --> 00:20:53,151
Speaker 0: Yeah, as long as I can be the Harkonnen in some capacity Why you gotta be so bad?

314
00:20:53,232 --> 00:20:55,003
Speaker 1: like I'm always bad I can't.

315
00:20:55,024 --> 00:20:56,631
Speaker 0: you'd be good cuz I'm not cuz I win.

316
00:20:56,651 --> 00:20:58,580
Speaker 0: when I play Harkonnen I tend to win dune.

317
00:20:59,704 --> 00:21:00,553
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz you're bad.

318
00:21:00,836 --> 00:21:02,906
Speaker 0: yeah Look, yeah, what do you got?

319
00:21:02,926 --> 00:21:04,491
Speaker 0: You got four treachery cards.

320
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:05,313
Speaker 0: I got eight.

321
00:21:05,795 --> 00:21:06,256
Speaker 0: like what?

322
00:21:06,437 --> 00:21:07,340
Speaker 0: Oh, you have a traitor.

323
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,058
Speaker 0: How many traders do you think I have?

324
00:21:11,443 --> 00:21:18,940
Speaker 0: So in some other news as you know pecs Online is happening because pecs is are basically not happening for the foreseeable future.

325
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,484
Speaker 0: And I just want to remind everyone that pecs online is a real thing and it is 24 by 9 meaning It's gonna go 24/7 for 9 days.

326
00:21:29,243 --> 00:21:32,440
Speaker 0: I and Scott and a lot of our friends and I hope many of you will do the same.

327
00:21:33,105 --> 00:21:44,960
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna take like a whole week off work But I'm going to like make a point of going online Going into these spaces and playing like online games with people during this packs watching panels doing stuff.

328
00:21:45,701 --> 00:21:51,786
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean there's been a lot of online conventions so far and I've not really Participated too much in them.

329
00:21:51,846 --> 00:22:02,411
Speaker 1: I've watched a couple panels from some of them like after the fact Like that but like I haven't like gone and like Attended in whatever that means for an internet convention.

330
00:22:03,353 --> 00:22:05,560
Speaker 1: I just been doing my own things, you know.

331
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:10,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, you know like we kind of say a lot especially when we're doing like pre-show stuff or in the meta moment.

332
00:22:11,242 --> 00:22:20,379
Speaker 0: For people like us where our jobs are just remote like we don't actually have any more free time now than we did before like Literally, nothing is different except we can't do some things we want to do.

333
00:22:20,942 --> 00:22:24,380
Speaker 0: But we didn't have enough time to do everything even before that.

334
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:26,370
Speaker 0: So there is no more free time.

335
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,280
Speaker 0: There's just more hassle and work that we're still doing.

336
00:22:28,662 --> 00:22:35,310
Speaker 0: So I'm not actually playing more games despite not going to work every day But I'm pretty excited about packs online.

337
00:22:35,612 --> 00:22:37,240
Speaker 0: we are doing a panel at it so stay tuned.

338
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:38,851
Speaker 0: We'll talk about that more in the meta moment.

339
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,429
Speaker 1: Uh Isn't this the meta moment now?

340
00:22:41,449 --> 00:22:42,254
Speaker 0: We're still doing news.

341
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:44,928
Speaker 1: Oh Okay, I thought this is the meta moment.

342
00:22:45,008 --> 00:22:46,334
Speaker 0: No, should I move into the better moment?

343
00:22:46,354 --> 00:22:47,520
Speaker 0: You want to talk about Luigi's penis?

344
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,027
Speaker 1: That's a huh.

345
00:22:50,322 --> 00:22:58,351
Speaker 0: So about Luigi's penis if you want Kotaku I was looking for like gaming news that I had something to say about and I saw a headline and They got me.

346
00:22:58,371 --> 00:22:59,159
Speaker 0: I was like, you know what?

347
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:05,419
Speaker 0: I want to see how thorough this article is because the article was titled it's from two years ago and they like resurfaced it.

348
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:09,807
Speaker 0: Bowser is only four feet tall Judging by Luigi's penis.

349
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,116
Speaker 1: This isn't your thing of the day.

350
00:23:12,176 --> 00:23:12,818
Speaker 1: This is still news.

351
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:13,260
Speaker 1: It's news.

352
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:16,675
Speaker 0: I'm saying it's news because hey, it's not news.

353
00:23:16,715 --> 00:23:17,680
Speaker 1: You said it was two years old.

354
00:23:18,061 --> 00:23:19,929
Speaker 0: It's uh, we don't do breaking news.

355
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:20,873
Speaker 0: We do commentary.

356
00:23:21,195 --> 00:23:23,932
Speaker 0: This is commentary on news Basically news at all.

357
00:23:23,953 --> 00:23:23,993
Speaker 1: if

358
00:23:24,013 --> 00:23:38,187
Speaker 0: you look at this article It compares like the size of Luigi's bulge in this promotional image to the length of standard tennis rackets and other characters And they do a bunch of math and they figure out how tall Bowser is and it's way more Thorough than it had any right to be.

359
00:23:38,729 --> 00:23:51,680
Speaker 0: if any of you if you are the original listener of geek nights You may remember a term that I don't think I've even said out loud in a decade But Gandalf's girthing when you argue about the physical reality of something completely made up for no reason.

360
00:23:53,320 --> 00:24:10,538
Speaker 0: so this article is pretty thorough and they make this argument that Bowser is about exactly four feet tall and The first comment in this article actually ruins the whole thing Completely ruins this entire theory with one sentence Bowser canonically has the ability to change size.

361
00:24:11,962 --> 00:24:12,385
Speaker 1: That's true.

362
00:24:12,445 --> 00:24:21,155
Speaker 0: so much for that and I would argue that Luigi at least in the context of this article probably also has the power to change size.

363
00:24:21,616 --> 00:24:22,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's eats a mushroom.

364
00:24:24,264 --> 00:24:25,071
Speaker 1: Hey changes sighs.

365
00:24:27,142 --> 00:24:33,709
Speaker 1: I'd also like to ruin the whole article by saying that Penises canonically have the ability to change size.

366
00:24:34,271 --> 00:24:35,817
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what I was getting at with you.

367
00:24:35,877 --> 00:24:37,522
Speaker 0: You went to the mushroom I was getting at.

368
00:24:38,004 --> 00:24:43,920
Speaker 0: the unit of measure that they're using for this can itself change size much like Luigi and much like Bowser.

369
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:51,597
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, that article just popped up promoted in my feed and I popped up a. yeah, just just popped up.

370
00:24:52,018 --> 00:24:54,259
Speaker 0: grew larger Mm-hmm hit a brick.

371
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:02,485
Speaker 0: anyway, it's time for things Of the day.

372
00:25:02,545 --> 00:25:03,529
Speaker 0: So what do you have?

373
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:05,074
Speaker 1: What did I have?

374
00:25:05,114 --> 00:25:06,680
Speaker 1: Let me remember by clicking FYI.

375
00:25:08,582 --> 00:25:12,040
Speaker 1: Alright, so I don't know if we did this as thing of the day or news previously.

376
00:25:12,181 --> 00:25:14,368
Speaker 1: This might be a rerun in which case oops.

377
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:17,540
Speaker 1: I tried to search my own website to see if this is a rerun.

378
00:25:17,741 --> 00:25:21,472
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know hard that is when you've been doing a podcast for 15 years.

379
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,860
Speaker 1: Well, and I have the shitty search functionality.

380
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,965
Speaker 0: Yeah, we never rebuilt it.

381
00:25:25,848 --> 00:25:26,712
Speaker 1: I'm rebuilding it now.

382
00:25:26,732 --> 00:25:26,973
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

383
00:25:27,515 --> 00:25:29,978
Speaker 1: Stay tuned coming along regardless.

384
00:25:31,221 --> 00:25:33,930
Speaker 1: So when we play counter-strike back in the day, right?

385
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:37,160
Speaker 1: We're talking like, you know counters like go did not exist, right?

386
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,200
Speaker 1: It was it was counter-strike and those counters like source and that was it, right?

387
00:25:40,602 --> 00:25:42,955
Speaker 1: We actually played a lot before counter-strike source even exists.

388
00:25:43,015 --> 00:25:43,920
Speaker 0: I was playing in the betas.

389
00:25:44,121 --> 00:25:48,215
Speaker 0: I was playing before the p90 was introduced and I remember when they introduced the p90.

390
00:25:48,235 --> 00:25:53,100
Speaker 0: it was way too powerful And that was a problem 20 years ago 20 years ago playing counter-strike.

391
00:25:53,441 --> 00:25:54,366
Speaker 1: Goddamn, we're old.

392
00:25:54,567 --> 00:25:57,300
Speaker 1: We had we ran our own little counter-strike server on my old desktop.

393
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,860
Speaker 1: Yeah in the apartment in the apartment there and on our counter a little counter-strike server, right?

394
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,153
Speaker 1: You know, it wasn't actually that powerful a computer.

395
00:26:05,515 --> 00:26:09,789
Speaker 1: So if we had too many People on it it sort of was laggy.

396
00:26:09,809 --> 00:26:12,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if we ran a map that was too big that was a problem.

397
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,376
Speaker 1: So I really want to run CS thunder, but that didn't work out too.

398
00:26:15,396 --> 00:26:16,000
Speaker 0: Well, right?

399
00:26:16,262 --> 00:26:19,658
Speaker 0: Ah CS thunder the best counter-strike map ever made exactly.

400
00:26:20,801 --> 00:26:24,900
Speaker 1: So what we did is we ran a certain you want to serve to be popular also, right?

401
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,639
Speaker 1: So we ran a server that ran one map and one map only and that map was FYI squirreled.

402
00:26:30,681 --> 00:26:32,005
Speaker 0: No counter-strike map.

403
00:26:32,045 --> 00:26:40,700
Speaker 0: naming conventions would be like CS underscore something or DE Underscore something or if you're old enough as or es escape.

404
00:26:41,444 --> 00:26:44,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, remember jail and that don't have first, right?

405
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,974
Speaker 1: So those first two letters would tell you what kind of map it was was.

406
00:26:48,055 --> 00:26:49,220
Speaker 1: what was the goal of the map?

407
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:49,643
Speaker 0: Yeah, like.

408
00:26:49,663 --> 00:26:50,392
Speaker 0: is it a demolition?

409
00:26:50,433 --> 00:26:51,000
Speaker 1: hostages?

410
00:26:52,481 --> 00:26:55,558
Speaker 1: Yeah, escorting the VIP out of the thing, right?

411
00:26:57,114 --> 00:27:02,052
Speaker 1: but FYI people say it stood for a fight yard, or I don't know.

412
00:27:02,092 --> 00:27:02,493
Speaker 1: Fuck you.

413
00:27:02,694 --> 00:27:04,320
Speaker 0: I always understood for fuck you.

414
00:27:05,045 --> 00:27:06,173
Speaker 1: I don't know what the hell it stood for.

415
00:27:06,213 --> 00:27:07,100
Speaker 1: I never thought about it.

416
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:14,380
Speaker 1: I just knew that FYI means you spawn you pick up guns off the ground that are near your feet.

417
00:27:14,521 --> 00:27:16,112
Speaker 0: They're just laying lined up like you look down.

418
00:27:16,152 --> 00:27:18,083
Speaker 0: There's like an m4 You look up.

419
00:27:18,104 --> 00:27:28,439
Speaker 1: someone else is also looking at is a tiny little like tic-tac-toe board Basically with three rows across and one row in the middle one horizontal, you know thing in the middle perfectly symmetrical.

420
00:27:28,961 --> 00:27:30,165
Speaker 1: You're not perfectly symmetrical.

421
00:27:30,205 --> 00:27:33,015
Speaker 1: There's some obstacles and crates and walls to hide behind a little.

422
00:27:33,035 --> 00:27:41,960
Speaker 1: there's a tiny by zone In the center if you can get to the middle of the map where the most vulnerable position You could spend your money.

423
00:27:42,281 --> 00:27:47,546
Speaker 1: You couldn't spend it where you spawned but you could spend it in the middle if you could get there and then that's how you Get grenades and stuff.

424
00:27:47,586 --> 00:27:49,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I get the joy of this map.

425
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,087
Speaker 0: The most important part was it's so tiny.

426
00:27:52,328 --> 00:27:58,930
Speaker 0: when you spawn and the game's like, okay ready and then it starts You can see the other team like you can like.

427
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:02,240
Speaker 0: sometimes like I'll be looking at a terrorist and I'm a counter-terrorist.

428
00:28:02,662 --> 00:28:05,090
Speaker 0: We're both looking at each other and the map hasn't started yet.

429
00:28:05,151 --> 00:28:10,065
Speaker 0: Like I've got my mouse just on his head Like ready to click.

430
00:28:10,728 --> 00:28:13,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what if he's standing on a sniper rifle and you're standing on like a pistol?

431
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,879
Speaker 0: Well, then we'll see what happens.

432
00:28:17,761 --> 00:28:20,312
Speaker 0: But you would sometimes get killed in less than a second.

433
00:28:20,855 --> 00:28:21,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was very fun.

434
00:28:22,804 --> 00:28:28,173
Speaker 1: It was and it was you wouldn't care even though in counter-strike when you die You don't come back to the next round, but the rounds are so quick.

435
00:28:28,656 --> 00:28:30,364
Speaker 1: It was so fast It was so fun.

436
00:28:30,666 --> 00:28:31,590
Speaker 1: You know, you it was.

437
00:28:31,972 --> 00:28:35,347
Speaker 1: you could just sit there playing ice world forever If the round went on longer than a minute.

438
00:28:35,467 --> 00:28:44,220
Speaker 0: that was like an epic match and usually it was two people sneaking Very carefully, which was usually fun enough to watch to where I wasn't bothered at all that I was dead.

439
00:28:44,902 --> 00:28:45,547
Speaker 1: Nope, not at all.

440
00:28:45,668 --> 00:28:52,479
Speaker 0: or that was like, you know what it is If you're that person who's left a lot so far boy, but you also know everyone's watching you waiting for you to fuck up.

441
00:28:53,102 --> 00:28:56,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, this was like the McDonald's of counter-strike maps.

442
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,480
Speaker 0: This was just like garbage that I was just shoving it in my face.

443
00:28:59,881 --> 00:29:02,832
Speaker 0: I probably played 20 or 30 hours in this map that one year.

444
00:29:02,873 --> 00:29:03,876
Speaker 0: We were running that server.

445
00:29:03,896 --> 00:29:10,797
Speaker 1: So these two articles I read them a long time ago but I guess I either forgot to make them news thing of the day or I did and this is a rerun.

446
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:33,556
Speaker 1: but the journalists here at rock paper shotgun went out and They wrote all about this map and they did a forensic Investigation of the digital files that composed the map to try to figure out who made this thing Right why it was named what it was made why they made it the way they made it pretty much everything And they found out.

447
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:45,700
Speaker 1: You know basically as much information as we can find out, you know using Research methods about the history of this map and why it exists and where it came from.

448
00:29:46,082 --> 00:29:49,098
Speaker 1: And if that's fascinating is someone who played it a lot.

449
00:29:50,421 --> 00:30:00,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, so my thing of the day I use this channel once before so I basically can never use it again as my thing of the day now because I'm using it twice but this was too good.

450
00:30:00,642 --> 00:30:18,387
Speaker 0: So this channel called tasting history is this dude and he will recreate Ancient and historic recipes of food like show you the process talk about the history God do like real research and then as faithfully as possible Recreate an ancient dish and then eat it.

451
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:21,979
Speaker 0: live usually for the first time on camera and talk about it.

452
00:30:22,581 --> 00:30:25,489
Speaker 0: Well, not live recorded on well recorded but live to tape like you.

453
00:30:25,529 --> 00:30:29,882
Speaker 0: record like that is his legit first reaction to this ancient food Right.

454
00:30:29,902 --> 00:30:30,584
Speaker 1: So some food.

455
00:30:31,025 --> 00:30:34,515
Speaker 1: the only video I saw from this guy's he made some old Roman condiment.

456
00:30:34,555 --> 00:30:35,799
Speaker 1: That's basically a fish oil.

457
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:40,834
Speaker 1: Yeah That is like supposedly was like the best condiment that Romans had.

458
00:30:40,894 --> 00:30:48,528
Speaker 1: It was just salty fish oil, basically Yeah, and he tried to make it and he made the best approximation He could given his resources.

459
00:30:49,051 --> 00:30:49,974
Speaker 1: and he ate it and it.

460
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:51,220
Speaker 1: yeah, it tasted like salty fish oil.

461
00:30:51,441 --> 00:30:53,373
Speaker 0: So this one is much more fascinating.

462
00:30:53,414 --> 00:31:08,385
Speaker 0: This is basically Kiki on is a healing potion from pre-grease like this is the drink described in the Odyssey and the Iliad that heroes would drink and Based on historical sources.

463
00:31:09,126 --> 00:31:12,475
Speaker 0: It's actually shockingly consistent throughout all of history.

464
00:31:12,916 --> 00:31:14,419
Speaker 0: What Kiki on is made of?

465
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:16,727
Speaker 0: So he made Kiki on.

466
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:18,680
Speaker 0: uh, oh does it describe here?

467
00:31:18,781 --> 00:31:26,639
Speaker 0: It's basically this mixture of red wine Barley meal goat cheese and honey, and it look makes this like purplish looking.

468
00:31:27,922 --> 00:31:28,605
Speaker 0: It's not like.

469
00:31:28,725 --> 00:31:30,675
Speaker 0: it's like a cross between a beverage and a yogurt.

470
00:31:30,695 --> 00:31:31,800
Speaker 0: It's almost like a milkshake.

471
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,467
Speaker 1: Mmm, it looks delicious.

472
00:31:34,728 --> 00:31:35,631
Speaker 0: Just like look at me.

473
00:31:35,752 --> 00:31:37,900
Speaker 1: Oh cheese and honey is already a good combo.

474
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,631
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a known modern, you know, I guess also ancient right?

475
00:31:41,671 --> 00:31:44,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is a food that is eaten widely today, right?

476
00:31:45,825 --> 00:31:49,033
Speaker 0: the other two things Barley meal and I like barley a lot.

477
00:31:49,053 --> 00:31:52,974
Speaker 1: barley meals really good Yeah, but I mean barley meal plus the.

478
00:31:53,074 --> 00:31:54,260
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess that kind of works.

479
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,074
Speaker 1: That's similar to like, you know, I wouldn't use barley meal.

480
00:31:57,114 --> 00:31:58,300
Speaker 1: I'd use maybe like a oatmeal.

481
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:02,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, like you have a yogurt you have a yogurt with some granola and some fruit, right?

482
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:04,027
Speaker 1: That's like it's a breakfast.

483
00:32:04,107 --> 00:32:06,176
Speaker 0: get some groats put some honey and goat cheese in it.

484
00:32:06,236 --> 00:32:07,702
Speaker 0: All right now we're talking That's some food.

485
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:11,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're just using goat cheese instead of like another yogurt in there, right?

486
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,890
Speaker 0: And then red wine like I really like red wine.

487
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:15,820
Speaker 1: I like using red wine instead of fruit.

488
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:22,340
Speaker 1: So it's yeah, basically it's like an ancient sort of combo that's similar to like a breakfast cup.

489
00:32:22,581 --> 00:32:27,287
Speaker 0: so the first thing I want to point out is one of the top comments on this YouTube video is Trojans hate this.

490
00:32:27,568 --> 00:32:30,560
Speaker 0: try this one drink that Achilles drinks every day.

491
00:32:32,412 --> 00:32:34,348
Speaker 0: But Watch the video.

492
00:32:34,892 --> 00:32:43,880
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna reveal Whether or like what this drink actually tastes like or if it's good or bad or anything Because this video is good like the history is really good.

493
00:32:44,161 --> 00:32:49,200
Speaker 0: But then you get to the point where he actually has it and tries it and that is when this video becomes a S tier.

494
00:32:50,143 --> 00:33:01,025
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that I would just opt for Your Greek yogurt or some other yogurt fruit fresh fruit, you know granola and What's the last thing honey?

495
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:01,507
Speaker 1: Honey?

496
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:03,695
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was particularly into this cuz I'm on honey.

497
00:33:03,735 --> 00:33:04,137
Speaker 1: I can't keep.

498
00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:04,960
Speaker 0: I'm on a Minogue.

499
00:33:05,101 --> 00:33:11,757
Speaker 0: I've always been like weirdly into Minnow in history and Recently, I've been more of a Mycenaean fan.

500
00:33:11,837 --> 00:33:18,262
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Yeah, you like the much later later degenerate societies that came after My stands.

501
00:33:18,302 --> 00:33:25,019
Speaker 0: neat but I've recently been learning more about cycladian cultures like prima no and stuff and it's all just very pretty cyclopean.

502
00:33:27,703 --> 00:33:32,519
Speaker 0: But yeah, basically the TLDR of that is the Greeks you think you know, like Athens and Sparta.

503
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,082
Speaker 0: They were basically like.

504
00:33:34,803 --> 00:33:49,938
Speaker 1: they kind of migrated into the ruins of like multiple older civilizations and kind of just took their stuff Mm-hmm, but basically basically it's you know, you read fantasy stories that talk about like, you know Lost Lemuria or Atlantis, right?

505
00:33:49,998 --> 00:33:54,330
Speaker 1: Yeah like that and it's like okay the Lemuria and Atlantis probably were not real, right?

506
00:33:54,511 --> 00:34:03,429
Speaker 1: but there were civilizations before Greek civilization like Minoans and Cyclopeans and Mycenaeans and that were real even crazier.

507
00:34:03,892 --> 00:34:06,665
Speaker 0: I was gonna talk about this and we're learning more about them all the time.

508
00:34:06,685 --> 00:34:07,469
Speaker 0: I got a thing in the day.

509
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:16,614
Speaker 0: Some crazy ancient ruins from them from the cycladian and the Minoan era were Discovered and have been excavated since 2018.

510
00:34:16,614 --> 00:34:19,900
Speaker 0: There's actually been updates in that field like big ones.

511
00:34:23,492 --> 00:34:24,614
Speaker 0: So, yeah met a moment.

512
00:34:25,016 --> 00:34:30,130
Speaker 0: we're gonna be live at the crunchyroll Expo with an all-new judge anime by its cover.

513
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,121
Speaker 0: We took that old old old panel.

514
00:34:32,141 --> 00:34:36,710
Speaker 0: We did once at an anime Boston We turned it for a while into a YouTube show that Scott and I were doing.

515
00:34:37,072 --> 00:34:40,952
Speaker 0: We kind of stopped doing it because it's a pain in the ass to make and not that many of you were watching it after The first few.

516
00:34:40,972 --> 00:34:42,780
Speaker 1: also also there's a powerful pandemic.

517
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, the pandemic makes it extra hard to make that show.

518
00:34:45,431 --> 00:34:48,029
Speaker 0: So we kind of paused it for a lot of reasons.

519
00:34:48,552 --> 00:34:58,516
Speaker 0: But we brought back the panel version that we did once an anime Boston Cleaned it up made it more to our modern sensibilities like wrote better jokes And we're doing that at the crunchyroll Expo.

520
00:34:58,536 --> 00:35:00,543
Speaker 0: as soon as I know when it will premiere.

521
00:35:00,984 --> 00:35:05,770
Speaker 0: then I'll let you know and obviously It was recorded live to tape like we recorded it in advance.

522
00:35:06,152 --> 00:35:12,711
Speaker 0: but we'll be in a voiled chat and you'll be able to ask you questions like during the panel and React to us or make fun of us or whatever it is You're gonna do.

523
00:35:13,253 --> 00:35:18,849
Speaker 0: we're also gonna be live at the penny arcade Expo online and we are doing a brand new panel.

524
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:26,290
Speaker 0: Scott's working primarily on this one and it's sort of a tangent from other panels we've done.

525
00:35:26,651 --> 00:35:32,030
Speaker 0: It's like a topic that we'd age into and talk about a little bit, but we'd always then move on to something else.

526
00:35:32,351 --> 00:35:35,461
Speaker 0: So Scott basically does the right turn and we're going deep into.

527
00:35:35,922 --> 00:35:37,106
Speaker 0: when should games ends?

528
00:35:37,608 --> 00:35:38,250
Speaker 0: How do they end?

529
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,333
Speaker 0: Why do they're gonna?

530
00:35:39,433 --> 00:35:41,801
Speaker 1: you're gonna design a game any kind of game.

531
00:35:42,283 --> 00:35:44,210
Speaker 1: you need to write in your rule book, right?

532
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,377
Speaker 1: The game ends when this happens.

533
00:35:46,839 --> 00:35:49,370
Speaker 1: Well, how do you write that rule that one specific rule?

534
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:50,214
Speaker 1: How do you write it?

535
00:35:50,294 --> 00:35:50,757
Speaker 1: And when it?

536
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:53,170
Speaker 1: what is a good thing to write and what is a bad thing to write?

537
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:55,537
Speaker 0: Yep, where is the finish line?

538
00:35:55,597 --> 00:35:59,870
Speaker 1: or a video game or a sport or I guess has to be a multiplayer game where there's winning?

539
00:36:00,171 --> 00:36:01,297
Speaker 0: We're talking about ortho games.

540
00:36:01,317 --> 00:36:03,387
Speaker 0: We're not talking about when should Final Fantasy 7 end.

541
00:36:04,832 --> 00:36:05,998
Speaker 0: Yeah, when should Death Stranding?

542
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,949
Speaker 0: and we're talking about like when should chess end?

543
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:13,405
Speaker 0: So Friday September 18th at 2 p.m.

544
00:36:13,746 --> 00:36:17,880
Speaker 0: Pacific time But since you know, normally we just say 2 p.m.

545
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,795
Speaker 0: Because like we're at PAX Pacific time That's 5 p.m.

546
00:36:21,896 --> 00:36:24,485
Speaker 0: Eastern Daylight Time on the PAX 3 channel.

547
00:36:24,947 --> 00:36:25,910
Speaker 0: It'll be live to tape.

548
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:29,190
Speaker 0: We're gonna record it live and then it'll be aired by PAX.

549
00:36:29,411 --> 00:36:31,902
Speaker 0: But we'll be in a chat room like ready to answer questions and stuff.

550
00:36:32,144 --> 00:36:36,017
Speaker 1: We're gonna want packs of Video file and they're gonna play it.

551
00:36:36,238 --> 00:36:36,418
Speaker 0: Yep.

552
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:39,208
Speaker 1: We could be in the chat room while it's playing.

553
00:36:39,469 --> 00:36:42,510
Speaker 0: basically We could stream it to them live like we have the capability.

554
00:36:42,871 --> 00:36:50,270
Speaker 0: but this is way easier especially because here we would we probably would have streamed it actually live if we were in the same room together.

555
00:36:50,692 --> 00:36:53,142
Speaker 0: But it's such a pain in the ass to do that right now.

556
00:36:53,223 --> 00:36:54,850
Speaker 0: So we got to keep all our options open.

557
00:36:54,992 --> 00:36:55,689
Speaker 0: So stay tuned.

558
00:36:56,831 --> 00:36:58,053
Speaker 0: I'm looking forward to PAX online.

559
00:36:58,113 --> 00:36:59,656
Speaker 0: Otherwise book club book.

560
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:00,838
Speaker 0: We're not really reading right now.

561
00:37:00,858 --> 00:37:02,180
Speaker 0: We're too busy working on other stuff.

562
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:14,750
Speaker 0: Emily and I reviewed Salados Amigos and I'm gonna post for the patrons our review of the horniest movie Disney ever made Donald Duck in the Three Caballeros.

563
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:23,250
Speaker 0: I'm gonna post that review for the patrons first because we can't actually post that one publicly yet Because in the series we're doing the reviews in chronological order.

564
00:37:23,892 --> 00:37:42,630
Speaker 0: We have to make it through victory through air power first, which was technically made between Salados Amigos and the Three Caballeros, but I cannot stress enough to you how utterly fucking horny Donald Duck is in the Three Caballeros like to a degree that is unnerving to my adult sensibilities.

565
00:37:43,172 --> 00:37:49,049
Speaker 0: I wonder what my parents thought about the fact that me and my little brother were obsessed with this movie and would watch it on loop as children.

566
00:37:51,255 --> 00:37:54,976
Speaker 0: You got anything any meta Any meta.

567
00:37:55,117 --> 00:37:56,263
Speaker 1: you should come on to the.

568
00:37:56,303 --> 00:38:10,870
Speaker 1: if you are have an internet connection which I'm sure you do you should use that internet connection and find all of the various spaces that we occupy on the internet and Spend the correct amount of time in those spaces and spend more time in other places.

569
00:38:12,072 --> 00:38:14,445
Speaker 1: But we exist anywhere you look on the internet.

570
00:38:14,465 --> 00:38:15,309
Speaker 1: We are there somehow.

571
00:38:16,271 --> 00:38:18,036
Speaker 0: Yep, our discord channels happen.

572
00:38:18,056 --> 00:38:21,527
Speaker 0: We got a forum where people are posting stuff like YouTube channels.

573
00:38:21,547 --> 00:38:22,370
Speaker 0: Just follow all our stuff.

574
00:38:22,631 --> 00:38:24,117
Speaker 0: Honestly, just google the word gig nights.

575
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:25,081
Speaker 0: You'll see a ton of crap.

576
00:38:25,523 --> 00:38:28,363
Speaker 0: Like we're past the error We're gonna have to give you a bunch of links.

577
00:38:28,383 --> 00:38:29,069
Speaker 0: You can find us.

578
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:34,972
Speaker 0: We uh, we've got a lot of Google juice on the gig nights brand from 15 years of podcasting Yep.

579
00:38:35,754 --> 00:38:37,902
Speaker 0: Oh, why do I have a notification in board game geek?

580
00:38:38,445 --> 00:38:39,890
Speaker 0: Oh, they're live streaming some Gen Con stuff.

581
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,161
Speaker 0: Okay Anyway, we are tonight gonna talk about a game.

582
00:38:43,241 --> 00:38:49,448
Speaker 0: pretty sure we reviewed this on gig nice a long long Are you sure we did a very long time ago, but what we're gonna talk about?

583
00:38:50,752 --> 00:38:51,981
Speaker 0: Search trying this out.

584
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:53,149
Speaker 0: We haven't played a lot of new games.

585
00:38:53,351 --> 00:38:55,930
Speaker 0: I just I'm playing overwatch cuz that's what I'm doing.

586
00:38:56,472 --> 00:39:01,888
Speaker 0: so we figured we take a game that we know very well and we think we're very good at and we've played a lot.

587
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:12,630
Speaker 0: and Without playing it again and doing some analysis We want to try to talk about like legit how to be good at this game Kind of like those panel we did on how to be good at Puerto Rico or how to be good at Carcassonne.

588
00:39:13,073 --> 00:39:14,727
Speaker 0: We want to do it for another game.

589
00:39:15,652 --> 00:39:23,110
Speaker 1: Yep, so if you don't know how to play the game modern art by Rainer Knizia We are not going to teach you how to play that game.

590
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:29,389
Speaker 1: We're assuming you know how to play that game already and before you listen to this podcast You should go and read the rules to that game.

591
00:39:30,794 --> 00:39:37,230
Speaker 1: If you haven't played the game You should probably play it a few times because otherwise why do you need to know how to win a game?

592
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:40,523
Speaker 1: You don't know how to the rules to or have never played before.

593
00:39:40,583 --> 00:39:43,597
Speaker 0: Yep, but the gist of this game The reason I think we want to pick this one.

594
00:39:44,179 --> 00:39:45,144
Speaker 0: It's a bidding game.

595
00:39:45,184 --> 00:39:55,848
Speaker 0: Like the whole game is run auctions for other players to buy stuff from you or Bid in auctions that other players are running and whoever has the most money at the end of the game wins.

596
00:39:56,990 --> 00:40:06,170
Speaker 0: You can also bid on your the things yours yourself auctioning off Yep, and there's multiple kinds of auctions like bidding and auctions is the primary thing in this game.

597
00:40:06,331 --> 00:40:07,736
Speaker 1: That's all you do in this game.

598
00:40:07,856 --> 00:40:11,530
Speaker 1: Yeah is run auctions and bid in auctions of various types, right?

599
00:40:11,891 --> 00:40:21,799
Speaker 1: So to win this game you not only have to basically your decision points in this game are a on your turn You're going to choose a card from your hand and auction it off.

600
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:22,883
Speaker 1: You're going to right.

601
00:40:23,345 --> 00:40:24,529
Speaker 1: you need to choose the right one.

602
00:40:26,192 --> 00:40:37,238
Speaker 1: The second thing your second decision point in the game is regardless of who is auctioning off what you need to figure out how much you are willing to pay for it and Bid that amount.

603
00:40:37,338 --> 00:40:39,390
Speaker 1: so you need those two things, right?

604
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:42,420
Speaker 1: Yep, and the rest of the game just sort of takes care of itself.

605
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:47,840
Speaker 1: make those two decisions wisely and you are good to go Yep, so the fascinating thing about bidding games.

606
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:52,190
Speaker 0: we talk about this a lot in panels lately to bidding and auctioning and valuation.

607
00:40:52,776 --> 00:41:05,781
Speaker 0: humans are just like Fred are naturally bad at this like people are so bad at it like If you like if you play Monopoly with kids It'll be random like it doesn't like someone will win because Monopoly is random.

608
00:41:06,142 --> 00:41:15,814
Speaker 0: if you play Monopoly and you actually use the bidding rules Against kids you'll probably beat them because kids will bid like a thousand dollars on boardwalk and then not have any money and go bankrupt Immediately.

609
00:41:16,157 --> 00:41:17,930
Speaker 0: people just is all can't do it.

610
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:26,439
Speaker 1: This is also why our human society has gone away from markets with bartering and Towards price tags on things in stores.

611
00:41:26,861 --> 00:41:29,490
Speaker 0: one of many reasons, but one of many reasons.

612
00:41:29,611 --> 00:41:44,860
Speaker 1: but in the days of bartering it's like bartering became a skill that pretty much everyone had to have or someone in your family or your group had to be good at it or Regardless of how hard you worked or whatever you how

613
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,790
Speaker 0: many nails is a fair price for two chicken eggs

614
00:41:48,791 --> 00:41:48,972
Speaker 1: Right.

615
00:41:49,012 --> 00:41:53,646
Speaker 1: So imagine you have a farm where you grow a corn or something and you bring your corn to market.

616
00:41:53,967 --> 00:41:59,551
Speaker 1: if you're bad at Selling figuring out the right price at which to sell the corn you get ripped off You.

617
00:41:59,571 --> 00:42:05,570
Speaker 1: just everyone else in the market is like hey loading up on cheap corn and you go home and you're starving and you can't.

618
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,917
Speaker 1: You know the other thing.

619
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:07,600
Speaker 1: we're not starving.

620
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,369
Speaker 1: you got corn, but you got nothing else, right?

621
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:11,533
Speaker 1: You know, you can't.

622
00:42:11,573 --> 00:42:19,970
Speaker 1: you got nothing didn't get enough other things in exchange for the corn, you know You'd not enough clothes not enough meats soaps, whatever you needed, right?

623
00:42:20,811 --> 00:42:22,095
Speaker 1: And you know vice versa.

624
00:42:22,135 --> 00:42:26,490
Speaker 1: maybe someone's really good at bargaining, you know, they don't have as much stuff, right?

625
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:33,868
Speaker 1: They their farm didn't output, you know They got one cow, but they bring that cow to market and they managed to go home with all the corn from the.

626
00:42:34,129 --> 00:42:40,070
Speaker 1: you know The person who's not good at bargaining how they're living pretty great and there's literally that's where people exchange their goods.

627
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,556
Speaker 1: There's no other goods exchange.

628
00:42:42,039 --> 00:42:43,204
Speaker 1: That's like your only option.

629
00:42:43,244 --> 00:42:45,449
Speaker 1: Yeah magic beans You're not good.

630
00:42:45,711 --> 00:42:58,670
Speaker 1: So if you the point I'm trying to make is that if you're not good at this game modern art and you cannot become good At it you would have lived a very shitty life in the ancient times when there were open-air markets for and no monies

631
00:42:58,992 --> 00:42:59,274
Speaker 0: Yep,

632
00:42:59,738 --> 00:43:01,010
Speaker 1: and everything was bartered.

633
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:02,294
Speaker 0: so first things first.

634
00:43:02,354 --> 00:43:14,383
Speaker 0: the main thing you have to be able to keep in your head to be good at this game is to be able to figure out the maximum possible value a painting could have.

635
00:43:14,623 --> 00:43:21,410
Speaker 0: because remember after a round ends the Paintings based on how many of them were bought by players and are out in front of people.

636
00:43:21,972 --> 00:43:27,090
Speaker 0: The what the top three pay out some money and the whole point of the game is to get more money than the other players.

637
00:43:27,431 --> 00:43:38,270
Speaker 0: So there is literally never ever a reason in this game to bid more money for a painting than it could Possibly be worth at that one single moments, right?

638
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:42,626
Speaker 0: So you can look at the chair is no clever strategy that does anything different from that.

639
00:43:42,948 --> 00:43:43,550
Speaker 0: not one, right?

640
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:49,232
Speaker 1: So it basically it's the more popular paintings right end up being worth more money Right.

641
00:43:49,453 --> 00:43:53,850
Speaker 1: and there's a chart on the side of the board that shows you the rankings of popularity at the end of each round.

642
00:43:55,014 --> 00:44:01,850
Speaker 1: So you can look over there and say aha It's let's say it's round two and you know that the Carl Gitter paintings were the most popular in round one.

643
00:44:02,191 --> 00:44:10,245
Speaker 1: Well that is now increase the value of all Carl Gitter paintings from here to the end of time Right, and maybe the van Gogh's are the.

644
00:44:10,305 --> 00:44:11,108
Speaker 1: is van Gogh one of them.

645
00:44:11,209 --> 00:44:13,021
Speaker 0: I forget I mean, it's all fake names.

646
00:44:13,424 --> 00:44:14,170
Speaker 0: if you play it depend.

647
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:20,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, it depends on which set you have like some people print their own copies of modern art and have different artworks in them.

648
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:24,244
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know Carl Gitter and light metal.

649
00:44:25,147 --> 00:44:25,689
Speaker 1: Oh light metal.

650
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:26,050
Speaker 1: that's one.

651
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:29,610
Speaker 1: So let's say light metal was super unpopular in round one, right?

652
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:39,850
Speaker 1: Well, you know that now the maximum value of light metal is now lower right over, you know Cuz even if light metal is maximum popularity for the rest of the game, right?

653
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:40,752
Speaker 1: It's the.

654
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:45,848
Speaker 1: you know that the maximum total value is now less by however many it is.

655
00:44:45,908 --> 00:44:46,269
Speaker 1: I forget.

656
00:44:46,289 --> 00:44:54,950
Speaker 0: Yeah There's a limited number of cards of each type of painting So you have to just keep a count of how many of those cards have been played already and how many do you have in?

657
00:44:55,190 --> 00:45:00,070
Speaker 0: Your hand and how many more cards will you draw over the course of the game that might give you another?

658
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:06,250
Speaker 0: painting of that type Mm-hmm the paintings that break ties toward themselves.

659
00:45:06,351 --> 00:45:09,670
Speaker 0: There are fewer of them as well and you just have to take all that into account.

660
00:45:10,051 --> 00:45:20,333
Speaker 0: But the thing I see people mess up the most is that once the round is over Like whichever painting had the most out everyone sells those paintings for $30.

661
00:45:20,333 --> 00:45:22,259
Speaker 0: each second place is $20.

662
00:45:22,259 --> 00:45:23,423
Speaker 0: third place is $10.

663
00:45:23,423 --> 00:45:33,118
Speaker 0: Everything else is nothing meaning bidding more than $30 in the first round on anything is 100% pointless.

664
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,368
Speaker 0: that just loses you points for nothing.

665
00:45:36,634 --> 00:45:44,102
Speaker 0: bidding 29 Probably not a good idea But it is plausible that there might be a reason to do it.

666
00:45:44,142 --> 00:45:46,650
Speaker 0: that one dollar profit might make sense.

667
00:45:47,072 --> 00:46:00,621
Speaker 0: But bidding 30 or more especially bidding more than 30 31. yet I see people do it so often even when when Scott and I pointed out to people at the table and tell them Literally bidding this amount of money will only lose you points.

668
00:46:00,661 --> 00:46:01,724
Speaker 0: Here is mathematical proof.

669
00:46:02,206 --> 00:46:03,590
Speaker 0: They will let it for ride.

670
00:46:03,691 --> 00:46:04,537
Speaker 0: Anyway, they'll say no.

671
00:46:04,578 --> 00:46:06,029
Speaker 0: No, I want I still want to go with my bid.

672
00:46:07,595 --> 00:46:09,446
Speaker 1: So this leads into two other things right.

673
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:12,418
Speaker 1: number one You're on your turn right.

674
00:46:12,458 --> 00:46:15,970
Speaker 1: the first decision point which of the things in my hand do I put up for auction?

675
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:20,352
Speaker 1: Right, whatever you choose is affecting the popularity You are making.

676
00:46:20,413 --> 00:46:26,670
Speaker 1: if you auction off a green painting a Carl getter you are making Carl getters worth more at that moment.

677
00:46:26,811 --> 00:46:35,390
Speaker 1: So if you have a bunch of Carl getters in front of you Even if the Carl getter you are about to auction if you don't if you're not the one who buys it, that's fine.

678
00:46:35,911 --> 00:46:38,820
Speaker 1: You have just increased the value of the two Carl getters.

679
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,788
Speaker 1: You've already got because you've made it more popular.

680
00:46:41,868 --> 00:46:42,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

681
00:46:43,172 --> 00:46:50,356
Speaker 1: so if you see someone else with like a whole bunch of light metals already in front of them because they've already bought them and Previous auctions that round.

682
00:46:50,838 --> 00:46:56,138
Speaker 1: you probably don't want to put a light metal out there Right because now you're just not.

683
00:46:56,258 --> 00:47:03,290
Speaker 1: even if that person doesn't win this third light metal Someone else buys it for even if they buy it for like a dollar, right?

684
00:47:03,591 --> 00:47:07,470
Speaker 1: Whatever you just gave that other person more value their light.

685
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:13,970
Speaker 0: They're gonna sell their light metals for more but consequently other players will bid more for your light metal.

686
00:47:14,672 --> 00:47:21,250
Speaker 1: Yes, because if you're desperate you put something up for auction and you buy it yourself your money goes to the bank, right?

687
00:47:21,551 --> 00:47:22,544
Speaker 1: So you better be.

688
00:47:22,625 --> 00:47:29,988
Speaker 1: you know If you're gonna buy something from yourself you better make sure that you're paying less enough that the profit of selling it is worthwhile.

689
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:43,999
Speaker 1: if Most of the time when you put something up for auction what you want is you want another player to buy it from you at a high price because if you buy something from the Bank, even with a big margin on your sale, right?

690
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:47,008
Speaker 1: All that does is raise your score, right?

691
00:47:47,048 --> 00:47:47,770
Speaker 1: It gives you money.

692
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:48,212
Speaker 1: That's it.

693
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:49,496
Speaker 1: Everyone else stays flat.

694
00:47:50,179 --> 00:47:55,750
Speaker 1: if I can get someone else to buy something from me Especially someone who's ahead of me, right?

695
00:47:56,053 --> 00:47:57,930
Speaker 1: Rim is in the first place that I'm in second place.

696
00:47:58,533 --> 00:48:01,410
Speaker 1: If I can get rim to buy something from me for a dollar.

697
00:48:01,932 --> 00:48:06,410
Speaker 1: That's the same as getting two dollars because rim has gone down one and I've gone up one.

698
00:48:06,511 --> 00:48:08,230
Speaker 1: I have to end the game with the most money.

699
00:48:08,353 --> 00:48:08,848
Speaker 1: I don't care.

700
00:48:09,291 --> 00:48:13,805
Speaker 1: You know how much of the most help what the differences between me in first place and rim and second.

701
00:48:14,167 --> 00:48:15,875
Speaker 1: as long as it's a difference I'm gonna win.

702
00:48:16,056 --> 00:48:16,822
Speaker 0: that is the mistake.

703
00:48:16,943 --> 00:48:23,790
Speaker 0: like mistake number two I see a lot of people making this game is exactly that they will buy their own paintings way more often than is warranted.

704
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:34,610
Speaker 0: That is usually not a good idea to buy your own painting unless like the situation where I've bought my own painting is Let's say it's the second round never in the first round and I got a bunch of light metal in my hand.

705
00:48:35,074 --> 00:48:39,288
Speaker 0: maybe I auction off a light metal and Someone buys it and pays me some amount of money.

706
00:48:41,112 --> 00:48:43,221
Speaker 0: Then or maybe I maybe I buy my own painting.

707
00:48:44,266 --> 00:48:47,650
Speaker 0: if I buy my own painting That's probably because I have more light metals in my hand to play.

708
00:48:47,971 --> 00:48:51,243
Speaker 0: So I buy my own painting low because there's no light metals out yet.

709
00:48:51,324 --> 00:48:52,990
Speaker 0: People don't think light metals that valuable.

710
00:48:53,254 --> 00:48:54,410
Speaker 0: They don't bid it up that high.

711
00:48:54,852 --> 00:49:01,349
Speaker 0: I buy it for a relatively low price from the bank, then I immediately when I have the auction up again I auction off another light metal.

712
00:49:01,873 --> 00:49:03,141
Speaker 0: So I've primed the market.

713
00:49:03,162 --> 00:49:08,744
Speaker 0: now people are gonna pay me Big for that second light metal and I'm also gonna get the margin of.

714
00:49:09,045 --> 00:49:10,350
Speaker 0: I got a light metal for cheap.

715
00:49:11,132 --> 00:49:13,319
Speaker 1: Yep, so you got to think about this.

716
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:16,187
Speaker 1: if I'm let's say I'm selling a light metal to rim for $10, right?

717
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:19,559
Speaker 1: That's a $20 gain for me.

718
00:49:19,639 --> 00:49:20,723
Speaker 1: Assuming rim is ahead of me.

719
00:49:20,864 --> 00:49:21,286
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

720
00:49:21,567 --> 00:49:23,132
Speaker 0: That's a good assumption Right.

721
00:49:23,333 --> 00:49:28,850
Speaker 1: So if that if that light metal comes around to me and I can bid on it, right?

722
00:49:29,432 --> 00:49:37,110
Speaker 1: I have to be bidding such that I'm paying $20 less than the end value of the light metal, right?

723
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:53,241
Speaker 1: So if I think the light metal is gonna sell at the end of the round for 40 if rims gonna pay 10 Then if I have to pay more, I guess everyone was paying Yeah, if rims gonna pay me 10 Then and I can pay 20 for it

724
00:49:53,462 --> 00:49:53,683
Speaker 0: that's

725
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:55,429
Speaker 1: I guess paying 20 would be better.

726
00:49:55,731 --> 00:49:56,895
Speaker 1: That would be equal right.

727
00:49:56,975 --> 00:50:00,166
Speaker 1: me paying 24 from myself is equal to rim buying it from.

728
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:03,025
Speaker 0: I feel like the math part of this Would be easier if we actually had like a whiteboard.

729
00:50:03,105 --> 00:50:06,401
Speaker 1: well people But actually not because rim is gonna then sell it for 40.

730
00:50:06,401 --> 00:50:07,264
Speaker 1: Yeah at a $30 profit, right?

731
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:09,516
Speaker 1: So you had to.

732
00:50:09,739 --> 00:50:10,590
Speaker 1: it's a basic calculate.

733
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:12,979
Speaker 1: They're paying me this much and getting this much profit.

734
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:16,493
Speaker 1: add those two numbers together and compare it to the number I'm paying.

735
00:50:16,553 --> 00:50:19,768
Speaker 1: first the number I'm getting right and see what the difference is.

736
00:50:19,969 --> 00:50:20,110
Speaker 1: now

737
00:50:20,811 --> 00:50:48,678
Speaker 0: honestly another sort of a better point there is Remember the compounding because in the first round like 30 is the most something can be worth But the second round the third round if a painting keeps showing up in The top three then all of the previous Showings add up so you can have a painting that is worth 60 or 90 like you can have a painting that's worth a ton Later in the game, so You don't really want to go too hard.

738
00:50:48,758 --> 00:50:52,810
Speaker 0: bid too much in the first round because the profits are kept.

739
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:54,897
Speaker 0: $30 is the most money.

740
00:50:55,298 --> 00:50:57,104
Speaker 0: any painting could be sold for no matter what.

741
00:50:57,787 --> 00:51:00,717
Speaker 0: but in the second round 60 is the most something could be sold.

742
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:03,327
Speaker 0: for the third round 90 is the most something could be sold for.

743
00:51:03,347 --> 00:51:11,482
Speaker 0: so Hold on to the auction types that are more powerful Especially the double auction for second third fourth round.

744
00:51:11,523 --> 00:51:13,310
Speaker 0: don't waste good auctions in the first round.

745
00:51:13,931 --> 00:51:28,702
Speaker 0: That's something that trips people up a lot because to play a painting whatever painting you play you are stuck with the kind of auction that that painting has on the card and some of the auctions are better or worse for you depending on the Situation on the table,

746
00:51:29,248 --> 00:51:29,410
Speaker 1: right?

747
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:34,710
Speaker 1: So let's talk about the different kinds of auctions when to play them and how to bid in them effectively.

748
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:41,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, right open auction is the least risky for everyone and tends to arrive at the most precise value and have the least profit.

749
00:51:42,133 --> 00:51:44,342
Speaker 1: Right, so the open auction is what is where it goes?

750
00:51:44,362 --> 00:51:46,410
Speaker 1: that everyone just keeps bidding whatever they want.

751
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:47,114
Speaker 0: Do I hear one?

752
00:51:47,134 --> 00:51:48,663
Speaker 0: do I hear two going once going twice?

753
00:51:48,723 --> 00:51:49,286
Speaker 0: I hear three.

754
00:51:49,326 --> 00:51:49,930
Speaker 0: Do I hear ten?

755
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:54,050
Speaker 0: I'm gonna be living my own painting going once going twice going three times sold to the idiot, right?

756
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:55,877
Speaker 1: So this is a very good auction.

757
00:51:55,897 --> 00:52:02,422
Speaker 1: it to play because play early in the game Because you're gonna get very close to the real value.

758
00:52:02,482 --> 00:52:04,750
Speaker 1: It's sort of like an information finding auction, right?

759
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:06,857
Speaker 1: It's like you're learning the value how other.

760
00:52:06,938 --> 00:52:10,310
Speaker 1: how much do other players believe this is worth, right?

761
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:10,691
Speaker 0: Think of it.

762
00:52:10,731 --> 00:52:16,510
Speaker 0: like every time another player bids like raises the bid they've revealed more information to you.

763
00:52:16,831 --> 00:52:20,170
Speaker 0: You're gonna get so many touch points with the other players than this auction.

764
00:52:20,812 --> 00:52:21,254
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're gonna.

765
00:52:21,314 --> 00:52:23,141
Speaker 1: this is really about learning not about making.

766
00:52:23,162 --> 00:52:25,350
Speaker 1: you're not gonna make big money when you do an open auction.

767
00:52:25,694 --> 00:52:26,585
Speaker 1: Right, you don't want to.

768
00:52:26,747 --> 00:52:28,750
Speaker 1: you know You don't want to do one of those towards the end of the game.

769
00:52:28,811 --> 00:52:30,527
Speaker 1: You want to do them early in the game, right?

770
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:31,777
Speaker 0: How you do today?

771
00:52:31,797 --> 00:52:34,315
Speaker 0: because if you do toward the end of the game It'll only pan out.

772
00:52:34,456 --> 00:52:45,145
Speaker 0: if you're like auctioning off a super valuable painting near the end But you're just gonna get the maximum possible reasonable profit Like it's just gonna write auctioning off something early in the game with an open auction.

773
00:52:45,205 --> 00:52:47,392
Speaker 1: Not only do you get its value It's like okay.

774
00:52:47,453 --> 00:52:48,757
Speaker 1: I get about what it's worth, right?

775
00:52:48,777 --> 00:52:51,105
Speaker 1: Because it's such a precise auction, but you're gonna.

776
00:52:51,125 --> 00:52:59,587
Speaker 1: that information is is non quantifiable Value that you're also getting and the earlier you get that the more powerful it is like.

777
00:52:59,628 --> 00:53:03,010
Speaker 0: first for example Say to an open information is useless at the end of the game.

778
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:14,410
Speaker 0: Let's say to an open auction on a Carl Gitter like arbitrarily early in the game nothing's out yet and Scott and Joey Jojo Kind of have a little bidding war with each other like push like back and forth.

779
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:17,169
Speaker 1: He must have hands full of Carl getters up the wazoo.

780
00:53:17,292 --> 00:53:20,300
Speaker 1: Yeah Like they know Carl Gitter is gonna be real popular.

781
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:31,310
Speaker 0: one of them wants to play a Carl Gitter Next to extract more value because it'll the bid will go a lot higher once people know If you're bidding in those auctions.

782
00:53:32,651 --> 00:53:34,679
Speaker 0: My advice to you this is psychological.

783
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:39,698
Speaker 0: like this is a strategy that does not work on people like us But it will work on other people.

784
00:53:40,221 --> 00:53:42,230
Speaker 0: if you know the value you're willing to bid.

785
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:46,570
Speaker 0: Don't be like bid up and get into bidding wars.

786
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:53,208
Speaker 0: just let everyone else bid for a while reveal as little information as possible and only enter the bidding if you still want it.

787
00:53:53,970 --> 00:54:00,627
Speaker 0: and The other players appear to be faltering off and the bid looks like it's about to lock down And they're below your number.

788
00:54:00,828 --> 00:54:03,832
Speaker 1: yeah Don't reveal your high number for no You know.

789
00:54:03,872 --> 00:54:07,765
Speaker 1: if they go over right like if I bid 20 and someone out bids me right.

790
00:54:07,846 --> 00:54:09,070
Speaker 0: don't be like I'm out.

791
00:54:09,232 --> 00:54:10,027
Speaker 0: Just don't say anything right.

792
00:54:10,047 --> 00:54:12,178
Speaker 1: well Let's say 20 is the most I'm willing to pay.

793
00:54:12,539 --> 00:54:16,272
Speaker 1: right if I bid 20 and someone else bids 21 22.

794
00:54:16,272 --> 00:54:18,730
Speaker 1: I just revealed information, and I got nothing out of it.

795
00:54:18,851 --> 00:54:23,429
Speaker 1: Yeah, I should wait, and if it gets to 19, and it's looking slow It looks like 20 is gonna be a winner.

796
00:54:24,012 --> 00:54:27,222
Speaker 1: Then I'll say 20, but if it looks like 20 is gonna be a loser.

797
00:54:27,262 --> 00:54:30,432
Speaker 1: people are quickly going 18 19 right and I'm like Oh, this is gonna.

798
00:54:30,473 --> 00:54:31,557
Speaker 1: Go past 20.

799
00:54:31,557 --> 00:54:32,320
Speaker 1: Don't bother saying 20.

800
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:32,862
Speaker 1: Just let it go to 21 22.

801
00:54:32,862 --> 00:54:33,264
Speaker 1: Let it go.

802
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:40,490
Speaker 0: Yep, if you say even one number and another player does not outbid you you made a mistake.

803
00:54:42,131 --> 00:54:45,970
Speaker 1: Yep, all right, so the next kind of auction is the once-around auction.

804
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:47,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, you put it out.

805
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:58,380
Speaker 1: everyone bids in a circle They have one shot, and then it ends up and you get the final say so this is a great auction when you are Pretty sure you want to be able to buy something yourself.

806
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:04,590
Speaker 1: Yep, right you there's a high margin on it because When you do this kind of auction no one can stop you from buying it yourself.

807
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:13,927
Speaker 0: Yep You always get the last choice and the only person who can stop you is the person before you by themselves Bidding way too much money, which they're going to give to you.

808
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:20,786
Speaker 1: Yep if anyone else bids over your number with the once-around auction you're gonna make bank on that.

809
00:55:20,866 --> 00:55:22,210
Speaker 1: so okay sure I'll take it.

810
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:24,222
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if it gets back to you.

811
00:55:24,443 --> 00:55:25,530
Speaker 1: Well you get what you wanted.

812
00:55:25,591 --> 00:55:29,379
Speaker 1: This was something you wanted to buy yourself And you have the power to do so.

813
00:55:29,399 --> 00:55:31,870
Speaker 1: no one else was able to pay enough to make it.

814
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:34,069
Speaker 1: You know worth your while to take their money.

815
00:55:34,632 --> 00:55:39,250
Speaker 1: Or maybe the person bidding who has the high bid is someone who's like in last place.

816
00:55:39,571 --> 00:55:42,663
Speaker 1: So taking their money isn't as good as taking you know your money right.

817
00:55:42,683 --> 00:55:45,514
Speaker 1: so yeah Then you just take it yourself.

818
00:55:45,535 --> 00:55:46,378
Speaker 1: no one can stop you.

819
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:49,169
Speaker 1: and the best thing is that if you?

820
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:53,604
Speaker 1: Don't play a bid if you just take someone else's money in this auction.

821
00:55:53,624 --> 00:55:55,190
Speaker 1: You don't have to reveal any information.

822
00:55:55,331 --> 00:55:58,062
Speaker 1: Yep, even better to say what you were going to bid you.

823
00:55:58,102 --> 00:56:00,070
Speaker 1: just everyone else reveals information to you.

824
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:10,340
Speaker 1: they reveal whether they were willing to bid more than the prior player and then At the end you can just say okay I'll take someone's money and don't reveal your valuation of that guy.

825
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:17,867
Speaker 0: and because they only get one shot they have to say The higher number if they actually want it like they can't play any game.

826
00:56:17,887 --> 00:56:19,112
Speaker 0: They have to be like 17.

827
00:56:19,112 --> 00:56:23,729
Speaker 1: they have to say that they say pass which means their numbers below the current number.

828
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:26,762
Speaker 0: yep Right uh there's also.

829
00:56:26,782 --> 00:56:27,989
Speaker 0: This is very opportunistic.

830
00:56:28,211 --> 00:56:37,110
Speaker 0: This is a good one to use if you have a very high value painting And you just want to have the maximum choice in how that painting get like how that all goes down.

831
00:56:37,973 --> 00:56:42,510
Speaker 0: The bonus of this one is that if no one if everyone passes you just get it for free.

832
00:56:42,673 --> 00:56:49,490
Speaker 0: I've seen it happen Mm-hmm sometimes that sucks in that you'll get basically get nothing for a painting that will be worth nothing.

833
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:53,318
Speaker 0: But that's that's how the game plays out.

834
00:56:53,679 --> 00:57:01,930
Speaker 0: usually if you do that like I will occasionally do a once-around For a painting that is not likely to be worth anything in the current round.

835
00:57:02,851 --> 00:57:08,630
Speaker 0: But I have a lot of that painting for later rounds and especially if it's the painting that has there's more of that painting.

836
00:57:08,995 --> 00:57:09,117
Speaker 0: Like.

837
00:57:09,137 --> 00:57:09,990
Speaker 0: they're not as rare.

838
00:57:10,452 --> 00:57:13,890
Speaker 0: I'm trying to thin the pool a little bit, but then be able to bust out later in the game.

839
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:20,389
Speaker 0: But that's a very opportunistic and nuanced play that would require a little more like a whiteboard to show you why I would do this in detail.

840
00:57:21,411 --> 00:57:24,250
Speaker 1: Alright the next kind of auction is the closed fist auction.

841
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:27,068
Speaker 0: This is the auction that traps players who have no idea what they're doing.

842
00:57:27,703 --> 00:57:27,870
Speaker 1: Alright.

843
00:57:27,890 --> 00:57:33,065
Speaker 1: So the closed fist auction is the auction where players don't have any information to go on.

844
00:57:33,105 --> 00:57:40,099
Speaker 1: you put money in your fist you put Your fist out there everyone reveals their fists Simultaneously and whoever's got the most money wins it.

845
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:47,720
Speaker 1: so you get information from everyone after the auctions over But you have no idea what to bid during the og.

846
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:54,458
Speaker 1: yup, so it's up to each player to be good at Evaluating the true value of the painting.

847
00:57:54,899 --> 00:57:58,992
Speaker 1: right because they've got one shot to pick a number put their fist out and open it And that's it.

848
00:57:59,413 --> 00:58:09,530
Speaker 1: so it's great for trapping players who overvalue things into giving you a lot of money And it's especially great for paintings that you don't want to take at all.

849
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:10,394
Speaker 1: Yeah Because you could.

850
00:58:10,414 --> 00:58:16,560
Speaker 1: just you can put it out there with a bit of zero Get information sell the painting and get a lot of money from someone else.

851
00:58:18,925 --> 00:58:21,647
Speaker 0: Yep, uh This is the one where players make the most mistakes.

852
00:58:21,888 --> 00:58:28,390
Speaker 0: people Weirdly like panic or have trouble with this kind of auction in particular in all games where this exists the closed fist reveal.

853
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:35,310
Speaker 0: I just watch people play Objectively incorrect bids all the time and fresh fish in any game.

854
00:58:35,792 --> 00:58:49,009
Speaker 0: So my advice to you is if you are struggling with a game like modern art Whenever the hidden auction happens bid less than you think you should Because that will hurt you less than bidding more than you should have.

855
00:58:49,932 --> 00:58:55,888
Speaker 1: Yep, it'll reveal less information about your evaluation if you win with that lower price.

856
00:58:55,928 --> 00:58:56,690
Speaker 1: That's also great.

857
00:58:57,054 --> 00:59:01,966
Speaker 1: You paid less for it And if you get outbid, well someone else paid too much right?

858
00:59:02,086 --> 00:59:10,077
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay Fix price is kind of the weakest auction because you after you're the only one who has to reveal information You have to pick the price.

859
00:59:10,479 --> 00:59:11,383
Speaker 0: You better be right.

860
00:59:11,564 --> 00:59:12,730
Speaker 0: I see people make mistakes here.

861
00:59:12,891 --> 00:59:17,110
Speaker 0: Usually they set the price way too low because they're hoping to buy it themselves.

862
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:22,889
Speaker 0: But if the price is actually too low someone else is going to buy the painting a hundred percent Mm-hmm.

863
00:59:24,151 --> 00:59:35,374
Speaker 0: It's the one that I will use if I'm playing a painting like let's say there's two Carl getters out but it's very early and there's also two of some other things out and I'm holding on to more.

864
00:59:35,394 --> 00:59:55,330
Speaker 0: like I don't have any more Carl getters in my hand and I suspect based on the information I've gained From auctions that there aren't a lot of Carl getters left in people's hands Meaning or the player who has a bunch of Carl getters won't get a chance to do another auction before the round ends in that I might put out a bullshit painting that I know is not gonna be worth nothing.

865
00:59:55,851 --> 01:00:04,579
Speaker 0: with a fixed price low enough to try to trick someone into thinking they can salvage it because they have Sussed out the information state of the game worse than me.

866
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:07,288
Speaker 0: I'm putting people in a predicament hoping to trick them.

867
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:13,789
Speaker 0: Otherwise, I'm playing a fixed price auction because I'm forced to because you don't get a choice sometimes in your hand.

868
01:00:13,809 --> 01:00:18,270
Speaker 1: Yep Yeah, yeah, the fixed price auction is really a test of your own skill.

869
01:00:18,411 --> 01:00:20,669
Speaker 1: How good is your valuation of it?

870
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:23,337
Speaker 1: Did you nail the exact right price?

871
01:00:23,657 --> 01:00:27,830
Speaker 1: that puts all the other players in a tough spot of choosing whether to buy it from you?

872
01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:32,910
Speaker 1: Or not such that you don't care who ends up buying it whether it's you or someone else.

873
01:00:33,231 --> 01:00:39,892
Speaker 1: You're happy with the result no matter what because you're so good at picking that number and this is sort of what separates the pros From the schmoes.

874
01:00:40,274 --> 01:00:40,535
Speaker 1: right?

875
01:00:40,816 --> 01:00:44,970
Speaker 1: if you can use the fixed price auction and set that price exactly, right?

876
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:49,698
Speaker 1: You're well on your way to winning the game But that's also very difficult to do.

877
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:53,390
Speaker 1: So why bother doing it when other action types are more advantageous?

878
01:00:53,591 --> 01:00:57,629
Speaker 1: All right, you do it when you have to and when you do do it try to do it very well.

879
01:00:58,133 --> 01:01:00,030
Speaker 1: So you got to do all that math of saying?

880
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:02,664
Speaker 1: All right, if they buy it at this price, I'll be happy.

881
01:01:02,724 --> 01:01:05,135
Speaker 1: if they buy it at this price I'll be happy if they buy to this price.

882
01:01:05,176 --> 01:01:09,070
Speaker 1: I'll be happy if I have to buy it at this price, then I won't be upset.

883
01:01:09,231 --> 01:01:11,167
Speaker 1: Okay, that's an okay price to put it out at.

884
01:01:11,207 --> 01:01:14,390
Speaker 0: yeah Yeah Also do not play the fixed price auction.

885
01:01:14,551 --> 01:01:19,981
Speaker 0: Even if it's a painting you want to get out there if you don't have a lot of money in behind your shield because you can't bid more than you have.

886
01:01:20,001 --> 01:01:22,738
Speaker 1: and Well, that's that's something else.

887
01:01:22,758 --> 01:01:24,686
Speaker 1: That's a more general strategy right is?

888
01:01:24,706 --> 01:01:26,414
Speaker 1: you can't bid money You don't have.

889
01:01:26,736 --> 01:01:29,470
Speaker 1: so if you keep buying your own paintings, you will run out of money.

890
01:01:29,651 --> 01:01:33,344
Speaker 1: You must sell paintings to other people for a lot of money.

891
01:01:33,364 --> 01:01:34,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't wait for the end of the round money.

892
01:01:35,012 --> 01:01:38,630
Speaker 1: That's gonna be too late Right, I guess this sort of is a little tangent, right?

893
01:01:38,710 --> 01:01:42,250
Speaker 1: But if you think about going to an actual auction right in the real world, right?

894
01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:46,930
Speaker 1: Let's say you go to like Sotheby's or whatever and there's auctions going on for famous shit, right?

895
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:50,830
Speaker 1: Some collectibles nonsense and there's some rich dudes there, right?

896
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:54,780
Speaker 1: Good luck getting the good shit against the rich dudes, right?

897
01:01:54,841 --> 01:01:57,650
Speaker 1: Because you know, something might be worth a million dollars.

898
01:01:58,252 --> 01:01:59,356
Speaker 1: You only got a thousand.

899
01:01:59,838 --> 01:02:09,938
Speaker 1: a rich dude can now walk away with that for a thousand and one because You don't have the million to bid them up to what it's the true worth, right, you know The same way thing works in modern art.

900
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:15,559
Speaker 1: if you don't have a lot of money if something's worth 50 bucks And you've only got 20.

901
01:02:15,559 --> 01:02:20,229
Speaker 1: Well, someone's gonna get it for 21 and Nothing you could do about it.

902
01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:34,250
Speaker 1: so you need to look at your own coffers and try to sell things to other players at high prices because Increasing your own funds if you're sitting at the table with a bunch of chips in front of you Even if you are weak in paintings.

903
01:02:34,331 --> 01:02:36,410
Speaker 1: You don't have a lot of paintings in front of you, right?

904
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:38,516
Speaker 1: Because you've been selling them, but you got chips.

905
01:02:39,098 --> 01:02:42,970
Speaker 1: you can dominate in the later rounds easily because no one else has ships.

906
01:02:43,131 --> 01:02:50,265
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're gonna be able to buy a lot of stuff way below value Even though everyone else was paying accurate values in the current round.

907
01:02:50,566 --> 01:02:51,569
Speaker 1: They were paying them all to you.

908
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:55,621
Speaker 0: So the double auction is the whole game.

909
01:02:55,741 --> 01:02:58,010
Speaker 0: if you play with skilled players, that is literally the whole game.

910
01:02:58,652 --> 01:03:03,530
Speaker 0: There is almost no reason to ever play a double auction in the first round.

911
01:03:04,333 --> 01:03:05,899
Speaker 1: No, no unless they're literally.

912
01:03:05,919 --> 01:03:08,148
Speaker 1: I've just a handful of double auctions by some bad and

913
01:03:08,228 --> 01:03:31,950
Speaker 0: honestly I won't even play him in the second round Unless I'm doing it specifically to get two of a painting out Either to force the round to end and cause a weird outcome that denies someone else a whole bunch of money Like I force a painting that my rival has three of into being fourth place and getting nothing But that I lose out too because I don't get to auction anything off like the round just ends.

914
01:03:32,111 --> 01:03:34,070
Speaker 0: That's a play that's highly situational.

915
01:03:34,070 --> 01:03:43,283
Speaker 0: You got to be good at math and know that the math will work out or I'm gonna get two out to force something to Four to guarantee that it's gonna be at least in second place.

916
01:03:43,303 --> 01:03:47,344
Speaker 0: I Mean, but it could fall into third place with the.

917
01:03:47,384 --> 01:03:50,779
Speaker 0: you know The whole precedence order and the tie break.

918
01:03:50,819 --> 01:03:51,963
Speaker 0: but you get my point.

919
01:03:52,003 --> 01:03:53,770
Speaker 0: the double auction is the big play.

920
01:03:54,132 --> 01:03:57,490
Speaker 0: It's gonna make one more paint one type of painting way more valuable in a hurry.

921
01:03:57,992 --> 01:04:17,204
Speaker 0: So my first advice is if someone else plays a double auction for one type of painting and then you Have one of those left in your hand a good thing to do is put that up for auction Immediately when you get a chance again especially if you go right after that double auction because people are gonna be pumped up.

922
01:04:17,566 --> 01:04:23,529
Speaker 0: that double auction basically Guaranteed that paintings worth cash and now you're gonna be able to collect some of that cash by selling yet another one.

923
01:04:23,892 --> 01:04:26,070
Speaker 0: Definitely don't buy your own painting in that situation.

924
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:29,049
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm the double auction.

925
01:04:31,011 --> 01:04:35,503
Speaker 0: Yeah, I really can't see good reasons to play them in the first round like ever.

926
01:04:35,523 --> 01:04:42,370
Speaker 1: no because the value of people have less money Right and the values of things are unknown and lower, right?

927
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:46,244
Speaker 0: You don't have that history of like Carl Gitter being worth 30 20 30 the first three rounds.

928
01:04:50,157 --> 01:04:55,527
Speaker 1: Yeah, so but you know in later rounds it's like okay How much are you gonna pay for two of something in the first round?

929
01:04:55,588 --> 01:04:57,135
Speaker 1: It's like Not much.

930
01:04:57,276 --> 01:05:00,130
Speaker 1: if you just hold that stuff in your hand until later rounds.

931
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:05,669
Speaker 1: It's like well two of that suddenly two of that painting you can sell it to someone else for a whole bunch.

932
01:05:05,789 --> 01:05:07,457
Speaker 1: Yep It's pretty straightforward.

933
01:05:07,477 --> 01:05:08,362
Speaker 1: You're selling two at once.

934
01:05:08,462 --> 01:05:15,604
Speaker 0: so like in a package deal Playing a double auction early in a round will cement that painting is likely to pay out.

935
01:05:15,865 --> 01:05:19,666
Speaker 0: playing it later in a round is Likely to give you a big payout.

936
01:05:20,951 --> 01:05:26,296
Speaker 1: Now remember the double auction that the method is One card has a doubler on it.

937
01:05:26,336 --> 01:05:31,070
Speaker 1: right you're putting it with another painting and you're using the auction method of the second painting.

938
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:31,796
Speaker 1: That's the rule right?

939
01:05:31,836 --> 01:05:31,977
Speaker 1: Yep.

940
01:05:32,279 --> 01:05:33,146
Speaker 1: That's the rule remember.

941
01:05:33,206 --> 01:05:33,650
Speaker 1: It's the rule.

942
01:05:33,831 --> 01:05:37,450
Speaker 0: It's it's a long time fiddly stuff around getting a painting for free and all that.

943
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:39,638
Speaker 0: But that never really happens among skilled.

944
01:05:39,658 --> 01:05:43,010
Speaker 1: you do not want to do a double auction with the fixed price.

945
01:05:43,351 --> 01:05:48,190
Speaker 1: Oh, no, that's that's not a good idea because good luck picking the exact right price.

946
01:05:48,231 --> 01:05:50,153
Speaker 1: That's gonna rake in the dough You don't?

947
01:05:50,194 --> 01:05:53,590
Speaker 1: you know, you want to use you know, pretty much any of the other types.

948
01:05:53,951 --> 01:05:59,530
Speaker 0: But really the once-around is really good with it because it gives you the final power over that.

949
01:05:59,871 --> 01:06:08,635
Speaker 0: Basically with once around and a double auction if the table Under values the painting you're just gonna get it like you're gonna get such a deal I'm gonna get two paintings cheap.

950
01:06:09,218 --> 01:06:12,650
Speaker 0: Yep, if the table over values it you're gonna get a big payout.

951
01:06:12,690 --> 01:06:14,120
Speaker 0: You pretty much win no matter what like.

952
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:15,610
Speaker 0: that's just always a good situation.

953
01:06:16,292 --> 01:06:26,230
Speaker 0: Yep, the only time you did net it won't work out is if the painting type you're doubling is Like at zero and other paintings are all already at three or four.

954
01:06:27,351 --> 01:06:29,078
Speaker 0: Then you're gonna waste your double auction.

955
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:35,760
Speaker 1: Yeah doubler on the open auction pretty good Yeah, right doubler on the closed fist is sort of a gamble.

956
01:06:35,921 --> 01:06:36,142
Speaker 1: right.

957
01:06:36,282 --> 01:06:40,495
Speaker 1: somebody, you know, everyone might bid, you know Poorly, right.

958
01:06:40,596 --> 01:06:42,443
Speaker 1: and you end up, you know putting out.

959
01:06:42,483 --> 01:06:44,350
Speaker 1: look like what number you putting out there, right?

960
01:06:45,471 --> 01:06:51,410
Speaker 1: You don't want to put out a number to where like, you know, if you put out, you know say 30. someone else puts 29.

961
01:06:51,410 --> 01:06:52,837
Speaker 1: It's like I'd rather what I had there 29.

962
01:06:52,837 --> 01:06:55,289
Speaker 1: Why did I do you know to decide you valued?

963
01:06:55,730 --> 01:06:57,276
Speaker 0: That's when I look at card counting.

964
01:06:57,577 --> 01:06:59,624
Speaker 0: How many of each painting have I seen?

965
01:06:59,925 --> 01:07:01,190
Speaker 0: how many are left in the deck?

966
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:07,570
Speaker 0: Like that's where you have to make the call because remember the historical values are all added.

967
01:07:08,011 --> 01:07:11,725
Speaker 0: But if a painting doesn't at least make third place, none of that matters.

968
01:07:11,845 --> 01:07:13,170
Speaker 0: It's worth nothing that round.

969
01:07:13,511 --> 01:07:23,769
Speaker 0: So if something if Carl Gitter when 30 30 30 and you're in the fourth round you might think oh Double I'll put out a double Carl Gitter as the first auction that'll pay out.

970
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:31,430
Speaker 0: big People might count the cards and realize Carl Gitter can't even get into third place Because one person has the rest of the getters in their hand.

971
01:07:31,450 --> 01:07:37,930
Speaker 0: They're not gonna play them and all the rest of them were already played to cause those three 30s to happen in the first three rounds.

972
01:07:39,433 --> 01:07:39,655
Speaker 0: Play it.

973
01:07:39,695 --> 01:07:43,337
Speaker 0: that's like the final mistake that sophomore players of this game will make.

974
01:07:43,678 --> 01:07:49,117
Speaker 0: they will forget that a painting is running out and Cannot place in the final round.

975
01:07:49,619 --> 01:07:51,887
Speaker 1: It's like oh this painting has been so popular the whole game.

976
01:07:51,927 --> 01:07:53,815
Speaker 1: It's worth a fortune Yeah, but there's none left.

977
01:07:53,855 --> 01:07:54,799
Speaker 1: people have bought them all.

978
01:07:54,819 --> 01:07:56,326
Speaker 1: there's no van goes left in the world.

979
01:07:56,386 --> 01:07:57,270
Speaker 1: They've already been sold.

980
01:07:57,691 --> 01:08:03,847
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's gonna be super unpopular these days simply because there's no you know, it's like everyone's holding their van.

981
01:08:03,867 --> 01:08:04,830
Speaker 1: goes no one selling?

982
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:12,690
Speaker 0: Yep It's only valuable if enough of them will be played before the end of the round to make it place at least third.

983
01:08:13,315 --> 01:08:14,729
Speaker 0: So you have to figure out what are the odds?

984
01:08:15,150 --> 01:08:16,639
Speaker 0: It'll be it'll place at all.

985
01:08:16,901 --> 01:08:24,557
Speaker 0: and once you figure out those odds Then you can use that and the maximum payout to figure out how much you should bid Generally bid higher

986
01:08:24,899 --> 01:08:25,279
Speaker 1: on that

987
01:08:25,481 --> 01:08:31,889
Speaker 0: if you are losing bid lower on that if you are winning The nuances if you can convince the players beating you to bid on it

988
01:08:32,578 --> 01:08:32,761
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

989
01:08:34,033 --> 01:08:42,270
Speaker 1: so the final thing you need to win a modern art is Luck because there is some luck in when you're drawing paintings, right?

990
01:08:42,330 --> 01:08:50,680
Speaker 1: It's like you might end up drawing And like the final rounds like a whole bunch of cards and all those cards are Unvaluable paintings that aren't gonna rank.

991
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:50,961
Speaker 1: Yeah.

992
01:08:51,062 --> 01:08:56,377
Speaker 1: No one's cared about them the whole game and They all have shitty auction types on.

993
01:08:56,398 --> 01:08:56,841
Speaker 0: so I get a whole.

994
01:08:56,861 --> 01:09:05,747
Speaker 1: because remember you start with a set of cards and you draw Three fixed auctions for Carl Gitter and Carl Gitter hasn't ranked in any round so far and it's the last round.

995
01:09:05,868 --> 01:09:06,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, fantastic.

996
01:09:07,752 --> 01:09:14,767
Speaker 0: Oh, well, or like I remember like I remember this game we played of it This was it like an early paxies.

997
01:09:15,671 --> 01:09:22,435
Speaker 0: I like I remember the moment because at no point in the entire game did I draw a double auction not once Not one turns out.

998
01:09:22,716 --> 01:09:28,689
Speaker 0: you cannot win this game if that happens to you unless multiple other players are very bad at this game.

999
01:09:30,093 --> 01:09:31,930
Speaker 0: But this was a table of like powerful people.

1000
01:09:32,411 --> 01:09:34,296
Speaker 0: So there was literally nothing I could do.

1001
01:09:34,376 --> 01:09:35,379
Speaker 0: there was just no way to win.

1002
01:09:35,459 --> 01:09:36,542
Speaker 0: double auctions are just.

1003
01:09:36,863 --> 01:09:39,609
Speaker 0: they're so powerful if nothing else.

1004
01:09:40,393 --> 01:09:43,264
Speaker 0: Make sure you are very careful with the double auctions you play.

1005
01:09:43,323 --> 01:09:44,790
Speaker 0: that is the key to victory.

1006
01:09:45,211 --> 01:09:47,982
Speaker 0: Once you get past the basics of don't bid more than something could be worth.

1007
01:09:48,564 --> 01:09:50,189
Speaker 1: All right, so you're playing the right auctions.

1008
01:09:50,551 --> 01:09:51,876
Speaker 1: You're choosing the right paintings.

1009
01:09:51,916 --> 01:09:53,100
Speaker 1: You're bidding the right amounts.

1010
01:09:53,121 --> 01:09:55,530
Speaker 1: You're participating in the auctions properly.

1011
01:09:55,671 --> 01:09:56,936
Speaker 1: Oh, that's what we didn't talk about right?

1012
01:09:56,956 --> 01:09:58,864
Speaker 1: So you're not the seller in the auction, right?

1013
01:09:58,884 --> 01:09:59,506
Speaker 1: You're the buyer.

1014
01:09:59,527 --> 01:10:03,859
Speaker 1: Ah Someone does the different kind of auctions, right?

1015
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:05,384
Speaker 1: How much do you bid on?

1016
01:10:05,444 --> 01:10:14,050
Speaker 0: Here's my simple heuristic number one I will bid more if the person I am buying from sucks at the game or is not likely to beat me, right?

1017
01:10:14,290 --> 01:10:17,490
Speaker 1: It's the opposite of what we said before someone's buying from you.

1018
01:10:17,650 --> 01:10:19,877
Speaker 1: They're going down and you're going up right.

1019
01:10:19,937 --> 01:10:20,980
Speaker 1: you buy from someone.

1020
01:10:21,221 --> 01:10:23,970
Speaker 1: you are helping that player whose current turn it is.

1021
01:10:24,351 --> 01:10:28,830
Speaker 1: So don't just look at the painting that they're selling and how much it's worth think about who that is.

1022
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:30,074
Speaker 1: It's like Oh rim is selling.

1023
01:10:30,094 --> 01:10:35,090
Speaker 1: I'm willing to pay less when rim is selling then when Joey Jojo is selling.

1024
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:39,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, right if that they might sell the same painting in the same auction type.

1025
01:10:39,651 --> 01:10:46,150
Speaker 1: But if rim is the seller I'd rather have my money go to Joey Jojo's, you know bank account than rims bank account.

1026
01:10:46,572 --> 01:10:47,296
Speaker 1: All right, so I'll pay.

1027
01:10:47,377 --> 01:10:49,649
Speaker 1: I'll bid less in the rim selling auctions.

1028
01:10:51,371 --> 01:10:55,848
Speaker 1: So that doesn't matter what type of auction it is, yeah, right it's just who is it right?

1029
01:10:55,868 --> 01:11:07,549
Speaker 1: try You don't know exactly where you rank in the game overall But you can get a pretty good idea because just how much money you have and how much your paintings plus the paintings You've already bought are worth, right?

1030
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:16,150
Speaker 1: So, I mean like you I guess you could track it perfectly if you're some kind of genius or you worked really hard But you could just sort of you know, get a feel for it, right?

1031
01:11:16,471 --> 01:11:17,979
Speaker 1: You know, you see some of the pile of chips.

1032
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,290
Speaker 1: don't buy paintings from them for too much money.

1033
01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:23,870
Speaker 1: Make them buy their own paintings to empty their pile of chips, right?

1034
01:11:24,150 --> 01:11:27,104
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know see someone else who has got barely any chips.

1035
01:11:27,144 --> 01:11:28,470
Speaker 1: Yeah buy their paintings from them.

1036
01:11:28,811 --> 01:11:30,457
Speaker 1: They'll have to won't be able to outbid you.

1037
01:11:30,498 --> 01:11:33,751
Speaker 1: you'll be able to buy them cheap and give money to someone who's not ahead of You.

1038
01:11:34,638 --> 01:11:48,722
Speaker 0: also you can Game people who are bad at this game a little bit and trick them into buying from you especially with the fixed price Mm-hmm, like look at the turn order.

1039
01:11:48,802 --> 01:11:55,293
Speaker 0: if a weak player is sitting to your left You can put the party if you can figure out a price that feels low But you know isn't?

1040
01:11:55,615 --> 01:11:59,808
Speaker 0: you can often trick them into buying something that there's no one else will talk.

1041
01:11:59,868 --> 01:12:01,797
Speaker 1: table talk You know talk about psychology.

1042
01:12:01,837 --> 01:12:04,130
Speaker 1: table talk is not banned in this game.

1043
01:12:04,190 --> 01:12:10,541
Speaker 1: You can be like, oh you can get you act like you're that guy that you know The smooth talker and the ancient barter.

1044
01:12:10,622 --> 01:12:12,410
Speaker 0: I got a handful of getters right here.

1045
01:12:12,490 --> 01:12:16,770
Speaker 0: Don't even try to make get her anything but like it's getters gonna be number one thirty points guaranteed.

1046
01:12:17,631 --> 01:12:23,345
Speaker 1: Right and just you know, try to mess with people right to get them to bid over under right.

1047
01:12:23,485 --> 01:12:25,430
Speaker 1: basically make any mistake whatsoever.

1048
01:12:25,631 --> 01:12:27,276
Speaker 1: It's just gonna benefit you right.

1049
01:12:27,738 --> 01:12:31,290
Speaker 1: just get people to not do all the things we just told you to do.

1050
01:12:31,642 --> 01:12:45,579
Speaker 0: Yep The other thing I'll do is something that I just tend to look for the painting that places Every round but is not in first every round like ideally something that's like 10 in the first round 20 in the second round 10 or 20 in the third round.

1051
01:12:46,202 --> 01:13:02,663
Speaker 0: if I have enough of that in my hand I will save and try actively to make it number one in the third round not to get those paintings But to get everyone else to buy them from me Because I know there'll be a lot of them and if they're in my hand Then I can put them out.

1052
01:13:02,723 --> 01:13:03,429
Speaker 0: people bid them up.

1053
01:13:03,751 --> 01:13:05,637
Speaker 0: Someone else will probably try to ride that train.

1054
01:13:05,677 --> 01:13:08,126
Speaker 0: put out at least one and I'll be able to buy one.

1055
01:13:08,186 --> 01:13:10,377
Speaker 0: to also capitalize on Both sides now.

1056
01:13:10,397 --> 01:13:14,559
Speaker 0: I'm winning on both sides of the transactions and That's a pretty good way to win this game.

1057
01:13:14,982 --> 01:13:16,088
Speaker 1: like so when you're right.

1058
01:13:16,511 --> 01:13:20,483
Speaker 1: So when you're participating in an auction as a buyer, right pick your number.

1059
01:13:20,504 --> 01:13:25,640
Speaker 1: right taking into account Not just the value of the painting but also who you're buying it from.

1060
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:28,930
Speaker 1: right reveal as little information as possible.

1061
01:13:29,514 --> 01:13:32,293
Speaker 1: Right if it's an open auction like we said I think earlier.

1062
01:13:32,473 --> 01:13:37,148
Speaker 1: right bid when if it seems like your number is gonna be a winning number based on other people's behavior.

1063
01:13:37,168 --> 01:13:39,239
Speaker 1: and If not, don't reveal your number.

1064
01:13:39,279 --> 01:13:41,130
Speaker 1: just let someone else win it because they're out bidding you.

1065
01:13:41,170 --> 01:13:43,036
Speaker 1: Anyway, you didn't have to reveal anything.

1066
01:13:43,537 --> 01:13:47,208
Speaker 1: if it's once around say your number if it comes to you on the once around.

1067
01:13:47,368 --> 01:13:49,669
Speaker 1: if it's already Over you pass, right?

1068
01:13:50,810 --> 01:13:51,694
Speaker 1: If it's a fixed price?

1069
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:54,946
Speaker 1: if the price is lower than the price that's in your mind buy it.

1070
01:13:55,227 --> 01:14:01,043
Speaker 1: Otherwise, don't All right, if it's double auction right try to pay less.

1071
01:14:01,224 --> 01:14:02,748
Speaker 1: figuring out the true value is hard.

1072
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:05,135
Speaker 0: So the lag.

1073
01:14:05,155 --> 01:14:08,430
Speaker 1: if it's a closed fist put your number in your hand put it out and reveal it.

1074
01:14:08,550 --> 01:14:21,848
Speaker 0: Yep, like this the last piece of advice I have is if you're auctioning off a painting or you don't care that much Like especially like an open auction for something that's kind of middling and may or may not place and you don't really care that much Like you're just playing it to get out of your hand or whatever.

1075
01:14:22,692 --> 01:14:26,763
Speaker 0: Whenever a decision is kind of arbitrary like that try to play a painting.

1076
01:14:27,044 --> 01:14:34,989
Speaker 0: that makes it more likely that someone who's doing better than You will get screwed Like if Scott's got three getters in front of him and nothing else has been played.

1077
01:14:35,754 --> 01:14:40,103
Speaker 0: auction off a non getter Like yeah, put out some garbo lighting.

1078
01:14:40,264 --> 01:14:41,170
Speaker 0: fixed price something.

1079
01:14:41,391 --> 01:14:46,449
Speaker 1: You're affecting the value of the already sold paintings no matter which painting you put out there.

1080
01:14:46,931 --> 01:14:52,127
Speaker 1: Right, so even if you know you make a good deal right on what you paid and what you sold.

1081
01:14:52,167 --> 01:14:58,570
Speaker 1: versus the value of the Painting that you're selling or buying You're affecting the values of the other paintings as well.

1082
01:14:58,650 --> 01:15:02,121
Speaker 1: Which gives or takes away money from other players of a losing player.

1083
01:15:02,141 --> 01:15:03,847
Speaker 1: has a bunch of getters in front of them.

1084
01:15:04,128 --> 01:15:05,958
Speaker 1: play a getter May get her more valuable.

1085
01:15:05,999 --> 01:15:06,562
Speaker 1: That's losing.

1086
01:15:06,643 --> 01:15:07,549
Speaker 1: player will get money.

1087
01:15:07,911 --> 01:15:08,734
Speaker 1: Who cares right?

1088
01:15:09,236 --> 01:15:11,304
Speaker 1: if rim is winning and has a bunch of getters?

1089
01:15:11,565 --> 01:15:12,670
Speaker 1: do not play getters.

1090
01:15:13,031 --> 01:15:14,276
Speaker 1: They're just going to make rim.

1091
01:15:14,437 --> 01:15:16,566
Speaker 1: or is existing getters worth more?

1092
01:15:16,666 --> 01:15:17,510
Speaker 1: don't play them at all.

1093
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:18,449
Speaker 1: Just hold on to them.

1094
01:15:19,075 --> 01:15:26,830
Speaker 1: Even if someone old pays for them Even if someone over pays you for them and you profit rim is also profiting even if he doesn't buy or sell them.

1095
01:15:26,870 --> 01:15:29,170
Speaker 1: It just sits there watching you trade them with someone else.

1096
01:15:29,870 --> 01:15:31,095
Speaker 1: Alright, don't let that happen.

1097
01:15:31,577 --> 01:15:35,208
Speaker 0: See what I realize, you know, what other game we could have done this with the listener pointed out I'm an array.

1098
01:15:36,392 --> 01:15:37,218
Speaker 0: We are both raised.

1099
01:15:37,259 --> 01:15:37,924
Speaker 1: Yeah, we could do.

1100
01:15:37,984 --> 01:15:38,327
Speaker 1: I'm an array.

1101
01:15:38,387 --> 01:15:38,750
Speaker 0: I'm an array.

1102
01:15:38,810 --> 01:15:40,078
Speaker 0: I think I could get to the point of like.

1103
01:15:40,118 --> 01:15:41,144
Speaker 0: here are set plays.

1104
01:15:41,185 --> 01:15:43,405
Speaker 0: this game is like super dialed in

1105
01:15:44,252 --> 01:15:44,977
Speaker 1: yep, pretty much

1106
01:15:45,098 --> 01:15:57,079
Speaker 0: partly because we played it enough to where like Literally, the only determiner of who wins when we play Amun Ray with our set of people is the randomness of what cards get drawn Because everything else like people play properly optimally.

1107
01:15:57,580 --> 01:16:14,890
Speaker 1: I can tell you this that in Amun Ray and also power grid I have a very similar heuristic because those games Modern art is just bidding power grid and mom and ray have bidding right in an auction Followed by a phases where you need to spend your money on resources.

1108
01:16:14,931 --> 01:16:22,370
Speaker 1: Yeah So an Amun Ray you're buying pyramids and farmers and in power grid you're buying houses and you're buying resources.

1109
01:16:22,693 --> 01:16:23,581
Speaker 0: I'm trying to end my.

1110
01:16:23,641 --> 01:16:30,310
Speaker 0: I'm trying to end my Operating building area phase with no more money like dollar tight, right?

1111
01:16:30,410 --> 01:16:31,054
Speaker 1: So what I do?

1112
01:16:31,114 --> 01:16:31,798
Speaker 1: in those games?

1113
01:16:31,878 --> 01:16:33,789
Speaker 1: my heuristic is generally, okay.

1114
01:16:34,091 --> 01:16:47,526
Speaker 1: Let me figure out how much money in power grid I need to buy all the fuel I need And all the houses I want to buy and I'll subtract that mentally from my money pool Right and the rest of the money I'm willing to bid on.

1115
01:16:47,627 --> 01:16:54,601
Speaker 1: if there's a power plant I want I will spend all the rest of the money on it up to right obviously Hopefully not all of it but up to that much right?

1116
01:16:54,942 --> 01:16:56,890
Speaker 1: It's like this is the money I need to buy resources.

1117
01:16:57,010 --> 01:16:59,902
Speaker 1: I'm willing to spend all the rest and the same thing on Amun Ray.

1118
01:16:59,962 --> 01:17:03,541
Speaker 1: It's like alright, I need this much money for pyramids I need this much money for cards.

1119
01:17:03,601 --> 01:17:04,870
Speaker 1: I need this much money for farmers.

1120
01:17:05,271 --> 01:17:08,302
Speaker 1: I'm gonna have this much money left over if I buy everything I want.

1121
01:17:08,342 --> 01:17:09,326
Speaker 1: I'll have $20 left over.

1122
01:17:09,346 --> 01:17:13,521
Speaker 1: All right Well, I'll sacrifice $20 to the gods, right?

1123
01:17:14,324 --> 01:17:20,547
Speaker 1: That's I don't need it for next round to our god Right or negative.

1124
01:17:20,628 --> 01:17:24,063
Speaker 1: I'll nay I'll spend everything I have to negative the gods if I wanted to go the other way.

1125
01:17:24,103 --> 01:17:25,630
Speaker 0: because that's one thing I like about sumer.

1126
01:17:26,272 --> 01:17:27,255
Speaker 0: Is the the?

1127
01:17:27,456 --> 01:17:29,763
Speaker 0: because there's a big bidding component in sumer.

1128
01:17:29,783 --> 01:17:37,650
Speaker 0: It's very mule like on the switch, but You can always bid an infinite amount of money if you're willing to spend victory points once you run out of cash.

1129
01:17:38,335 --> 01:17:39,201
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's pretty fun.

1130
01:17:39,504 --> 01:17:53,730
Speaker 0: That's real fun and sometimes it's the right idea, but that is the kind of mechanic much like the auctions in modern art that will cause a poor or Mathematically deficient player to make a very bad decision and destroy themselves in the first round.

1131
01:17:54,671 --> 01:18:01,343
Speaker 1: Alright, so I think hope that helps people win at modern art and also other bidding games Gives you something to think about.

1132
01:18:01,363 --> 01:18:04,941
Speaker 1: it's a good game I think to do this with on a podcast because it's not.

1133
01:18:05,262 --> 01:18:07,190
Speaker 1: there's no like visual elements to modern art.

1134
01:18:07,291 --> 01:18:09,570
Speaker 1: It's not like a chess where you have to see the the board.

1135
01:18:10,012 --> 01:18:13,429
Speaker 0: I think the only thing that would have that we could do if we made this with a video.

1136
01:18:13,852 --> 01:18:15,038
Speaker 1: There's an actual math.

1137
01:18:15,199 --> 01:18:16,306
Speaker 1: Yeah, I do the actual math.

1138
01:18:16,386 --> 01:18:17,010
Speaker 1: or even like much.

1139
01:18:17,070 --> 01:18:21,487
Speaker 0: Is it gonna be worth show like a table and show like here's a situation?

1140
01:18:21,528 --> 01:18:22,090
Speaker 0: What do you do?

1141
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:26,990
Speaker 0: Like here's what I would do exactly if the board look like there is a packs unplugged again.

1142
01:18:27,090 --> 01:18:28,576
Speaker 1: Why don't we do learn and win modern art?

1143
01:18:28,837 --> 01:18:31,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm 100% down for that because it got reprinted a bunch of times.

1144
01:18:32,411 --> 01:18:36,045
Speaker 0: Yeah, we don't like the reprints, but I like the terrible art from the first one.

1145
01:18:36,587 --> 01:18:39,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, well I don't know if the one you have is even the first one.

1146
01:18:39,321 --> 01:18:41,010
Speaker 1: There's probably older ones, but it's been again.

1147
01:18:41,030 --> 01:18:42,198
Speaker 1: It's been printed many times.

1148
01:18:42,258 --> 01:18:44,070
Speaker 1: There's also lots of print and play editions.

1149
01:18:44,251 --> 01:18:52,748
Speaker 1: Yeah, obviously you should be buying a copy of a game that you want But you know buy it and then if you like different art, maybe you know make also print one, right?

1150
01:18:53,009 --> 01:18:57,145
Speaker 1: Yeah But yeah, there's also modern art the card game which is slightly different.

1151
01:18:57,225 --> 01:19:00,756
Speaker 1: I haven't played it But it I believe it is more portable.

1152
01:19:01,237 --> 01:19:02,861
Speaker 1: So maybe try that one.

1153
01:19:02,902 --> 01:19:03,243
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1154
01:19:03,343 --> 01:19:05,770
Speaker 0: modern art is in a tiny tiny box.

1155
01:19:06,432 --> 01:19:10,169
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you won't have if you're playing or playing the car or something true the or on a train.

1156
01:19:10,430 --> 01:19:13,221
Speaker 1: Yeah, not having the chips I guess would be an improvement.

1157
01:19:13,421 --> 01:19:13,682
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1158
01:19:14,485 --> 01:19:14,766
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1159
01:19:14,887 --> 01:19:15,770
Speaker 1: I haven't played the card game.

1160
01:19:15,830 --> 01:19:16,876
Speaker 1: I just know that it's a version.

1161
01:19:16,917 --> 01:19:17,560
Speaker 1: It's only cards.

1162
01:19:17,701 --> 01:19:17,943
