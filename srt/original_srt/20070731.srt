1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,368
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday July 31st.

2
00:00:11,488 --> 00:00:12,833
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,073 --> 00:00:15,100
Speaker 0: I'm rim, and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:19,379
Speaker 0: Tonight we ramble a bit about the shoot-em-up games.

5
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:25,397
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,288 --> 00:00:34,118
Speaker 1: You know it wasn't too long ago We were talking about poke fatigue And how we were kind of sick and done at Pokemon.

7
00:00:34,661 --> 00:00:36,749
Speaker 1: that kind of got ruined over the week at the shore.

8
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:36,910
Speaker 1: when?

9
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,039
Speaker 1: Everyone had their pokemans, and they were showing me them.

10
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:40,762
Speaker 0: well basically.

11
00:00:40,842 --> 00:00:42,970
Speaker 0: I was had super Pokemon fatigue.

12
00:00:43,091 --> 00:00:44,826
Speaker 0: I had no desire to play whatsoever.

13
00:00:44,846 --> 00:00:53,252
Speaker 0: all right I kind of wanted to have the team that I wanted, but I didn't want to play the game at all and so I Didn't play.

14
00:00:53,393 --> 00:00:59,015
Speaker 0: and then at the shore well actually at Otakon someone traded me a spirit tube Which is my favorite Pokemon.

15
00:00:59,497 --> 00:01:02,930
Speaker 0: and then when we got to the the vacation spot?

16
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:12,260
Speaker 0: I we all went in the underground and I discovered that in the underground there are actual things down there that matter in the game As opposed to just useless spheres and crap.

17
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,610
Speaker 1: however that fact kind of pissed me off.

18
00:01:15,095 --> 00:01:16,389
Speaker 1: I didn't want to have to go down there.

19
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:17,655
Speaker 0: Yeah, well anyway.

20
00:01:17,675 --> 00:01:21,150
Speaker 0: I like getting the fossils because I like a lot of the fossil type Pokemon.

21
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,557
Speaker 1: No, no you like having the fossils.

22
00:01:22,698 --> 00:01:24,970
Speaker 1: I don't believe you like the process of getting the fossils?

23
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:30,428
Speaker 0: No, not really, but I do like the fossil pokemons like the omenites and the Kabuto's right.

24
00:01:30,849 --> 00:01:38,324
Speaker 0: so You know I was having a little bit of fun with the Pokemon again suddenly And then I had two spirit tombs and I started hatching spirit two megs.

25
00:01:38,464 --> 00:01:49,918
Speaker 0: Scott made a million spirit two megs and then I was hatching combis and Komi is the best Pokemon combis an awesome Pokemon, and then I said hey, I got spirits whom I got combi Let's get this on.

26
00:01:50,581 --> 00:01:52,250
Speaker 0: and I started playing a lot more pokemons.

27
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:55,662
Speaker 0: And then I haven't played pokemons since I got home.

28
00:01:56,264 --> 00:01:58,576
Speaker 1: see I wasn't a little bit of different boat I was just stuck.

29
00:01:58,616 --> 00:02:00,430
Speaker 1: I didn't know where to go cuz I hadn't played it in a while.

30
00:02:00,531 --> 00:02:02,248
Speaker 1: I didn't remember what was going on in the plot.

31
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:03,759
Speaker 0: well That's why when you turn the game on it.

32
00:02:03,779 --> 00:02:04,947
Speaker 0: Tells you what you did last.

33
00:02:05,169 --> 00:02:07,769
Speaker 1: yeah And what I did last was wander around trying to figure out where to go.

34
00:02:08,412 --> 00:02:08,753
Speaker 0: Awesome,

35
00:02:09,478 --> 00:02:26,568
Speaker 1: so as someone told me and I went up and I got my Gigantic special Pokemon and did all that and I'm nearing the end of the game And I realized that yeah, I want to actually beat this game however When I was playing around with everyone else and they were all in the underground and I refused to participate in that underground shenanigans.

36
00:02:26,589 --> 00:02:34,078
Speaker 1: I I realized that a lot of the things that I can do in this game But that I probably should do to have optimal Pokemon.

37
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,908
Speaker 1: I'm not willing to do Evie training.

38
00:02:36,968 --> 00:02:37,530
Speaker 1: I'm gonna fuck it.

39
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,549
Speaker 0: So I'm not willing to do those things either.

40
00:02:40,371 --> 00:02:41,055
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna.

41
00:02:41,135 --> 00:02:48,310
Speaker 0: you know basically the only other reason I started playing again is Because after you beat the game this island in the and the Northeast opens up to you, right?

42
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:56,110
Speaker 0: so I explored that entire island before I got fatigued and There was a volcano on that island that I just couldn't get to somehow.

43
00:02:56,351 --> 00:02:59,964
Speaker 0: So I kind of stopped playing because I couldn't get to the volcano or figure out how.

44
00:03:00,044 --> 00:03:02,553
Speaker 0: and I figured out how to go up That volcano.

45
00:03:02,593 --> 00:03:12,190
Speaker 0: so that sort of brought me back into the game and I'm pretty sure even though I'm fatigued again I will un-fatigued enough to go up the whole volcano also.

46
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,563
Speaker 0: We're just walking around the game like doing stuff while people were around.

47
00:03:16,944 --> 00:03:22,844
Speaker 0: I discovered like hidden places in the game I didn't know about before like the Fuego ironworks and stuff like that.

48
00:03:22,944 --> 00:03:24,650
Speaker 0: I also learned how to use the versus seeker.

49
00:03:26,131 --> 00:03:27,338
Speaker 1: So that's been around a while.

50
00:03:27,358 --> 00:03:29,490
Speaker 0: I know I just never knew how to use it properly.

51
00:03:29,571 --> 00:03:30,598
Speaker 0: It was like I'd push the button.

52
00:03:30,618 --> 00:03:32,329
Speaker 0: It would make a noise and it wouldn't do anything.

53
00:03:32,793 --> 00:03:34,448
Speaker 0: So I was like how the hell is this piece of shit work?

54
00:03:36,212 --> 00:03:36,616
Speaker 0: Cuz they weren't.

55
00:03:36,657 --> 00:03:40,530
Speaker 0: it didn't come with directions So I didn't know how to make it do its thing.

56
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:42,429
Speaker 1: They kind of told you what it did and how to use it.

57
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,563
Speaker 0: No, not when I got it.

58
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:47,524
Speaker 0: when I got it It said you can use this to fight trainers again, and I'm like, okay how?

59
00:03:47,684 --> 00:03:49,090
Speaker 1: so didn't you wonder like?

60
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,759
Speaker 1: Maybe I should go to where trainers are that I fought once.

61
00:03:52,101 --> 00:03:52,542
Speaker 0: I didn't.

62
00:03:52,743 --> 00:03:54,068
Speaker 0: I didn't even try really.

63
00:03:54,088 --> 00:03:55,676
Speaker 0: so Push the button.

64
00:03:55,716 --> 00:03:57,245
Speaker 0: it made a noise and didn't do anything once.

65
00:03:57,265 --> 00:04:01,010
Speaker 0: so I put it away And I could never get it to work in the older games either.

66
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:08,310
Speaker 0: So yeah, basically because I figured out how some stuff works in the game and found some new places a slightly rekindled interest.

67
00:04:08,392 --> 00:04:09,792
Speaker 0: But that's about it I don't know.

68
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:16,219
Speaker 1: I think for me and I said at the shore quite famously that I'm done with Pokemon to which people responded Well, then give me all your pokemons.

69
00:04:16,863 --> 00:04:35,590
Speaker 1: I'm not done with it in that regard I'm done with it in the sense that I am NOT going to put any effort into this game other than getting My perfect team maybe one like funny auxiliary team I'm thinking to make it an all anthropomorphic team great because there's actually far more than six anthropomorphic Pokemon at this point.

70
00:04:35,934 --> 00:04:36,136
Speaker 0: yep,

71
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:49,890
Speaker 1: and That's gonna be it because while I realized I don't really care about a good 80% of the game And I've already gotten the whole Pokemon experience It is kind of fun to battle with other people in public and I need a team to be able to do that.

72
00:04:50,271 --> 00:04:58,349
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the thing is I really want to have a perfect team of six Pokemon I really like but I do not want to have to do the work necessary to get that team.

73
00:04:58,692 --> 00:05:09,449
Speaker 1: So I realized I'm gonna do the work to get a team That's good enough to sit at an artist alley table and play against you listeners But I'm not gonna make a team that's good enough to beat the kid with six legendaries in the tournament.

74
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:14,527
Speaker 1: No, I'm definitely not gonna do this level one EV trains sub to hacked legendaries.

75
00:05:14,768 --> 00:05:26,030
Speaker 1: Yeah okay, so in the news I With we miss this since we were out on vacation But I find this sort of thing fascinating and it's the kind of thing we talk about a lot.

76
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:29,306
Speaker 1: It's also the kind of thing that gets us hecklers at Connecticut on.

77
00:05:29,327 --> 00:05:36,388
Speaker 1: yeah But we've talked a lot about board games and German games and how a lot of times we get sick of a game once we Solve it.

78
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:44,398
Speaker 1: You know when you realize you come to the core of a game and you read you now know the exact Optimal move to make at any time and beyond.

79
00:05:44,438 --> 00:05:46,886
Speaker 1: that victory is either predetermined or random.

80
00:05:47,527 --> 00:05:55,189
Speaker 1: Well, uh Some games particularly perfect information games can be solved in a very simple but not easy way.

81
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:57,900
Speaker 1: now I say simple but not easy because it is simple.

82
00:05:58,582 --> 00:06:00,310
Speaker 1: There is it's a perfect information game.

83
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,675
Speaker 1: You know every possible move.

84
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:04,085
Speaker 1: you can't hide information from the other person.

85
00:06:04,446 --> 00:06:05,390
Speaker 1: Everyone knows everything.

86
00:06:06,092 --> 00:06:10,666
Speaker 1: So all you have to do is have a computer try every single possible move.

87
00:06:11,147 --> 00:06:11,930
Speaker 1: That's very simple.

88
00:06:12,431 --> 00:06:20,170
Speaker 1: It's not however easy because a game like say checkers or chess has a lot of possible moves Like a bajillion.

89
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:29,090
Speaker 1: Well people have been working on these problems and a lot of smaller games have been solved in the past Like I believe five by five go is perfectly solved.

90
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:34,265
Speaker 1: Yep, just recently the game of checkers a game that I very much enjoy.

91
00:06:34,486 --> 00:06:35,349
Speaker 0: you enjoy checkers.

92
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:35,730
Speaker 1: I did it.

93
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,159
Speaker 1: I enjoyed checkers more than chess.

94
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,870
Speaker 0: I kind of like checkers, of course.

95
00:06:39,011 --> 00:06:48,245
Speaker 1: I think the reason was when I was a kid I had a friend named Adam who was actually a semi professional chess competitor And he was super super good and he was ranked.

96
00:06:48,265 --> 00:06:53,230
Speaker 1: and as a result Whenever I played chess, I always fucking lost and it was no fun at all.

97
00:06:53,311 --> 00:07:03,709
Speaker 0: I used to like chess more than like it now because Like when I'm just a kid and I got like little pieces that I'll move in weird ways It's like ooh wee fun times killing the other guys, you know.

98
00:07:04,271 --> 00:07:08,447
Speaker 0: But once you know chess sort of opened up and I saw what chess really was all about.

99
00:07:08,467 --> 00:07:09,230
Speaker 0: I didn't like that.

100
00:07:09,332 --> 00:07:09,927
Speaker 0: I'm not a fan.

101
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:15,890
Speaker 1: Yeah playing against him like seeing the patterns and realizing that the game was not about tactics or strategy.

102
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,335
Speaker 1: Well, I guess it was about strategy.

103
00:07:17,897 --> 00:07:21,430
Speaker 1: It's more about memorizing patterns long complex patterns.

104
00:07:22,238 --> 00:07:28,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway The game of checkers which I thought was fun is solved completely and perfectly.

105
00:07:29,111 --> 00:07:36,870
Speaker 1: It turns out that the first player black is guaranteed if he plays optimally and the other person also plays optimally a draw.

106
00:07:37,672 --> 00:07:47,070
Speaker 0: Yep, it's just like tic-tac-toe if everyone plays perfectly and makes the best possible move every time the game is a tie Every time yep.

107
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:57,528
Speaker 1: So by the same token no matter what player one does has his first move player two white can automatically if they make optimal moves from this point forward no matter what make the game a draw.

108
00:07:57,548 --> 00:08:04,610
Speaker 1: as a result the game of checkers is Completely and fundamentally and utterly broken and solved in every possible way.

109
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:08,270
Speaker 0: Yep, playing checkers is basically the same as playing tic-tac-toe.

110
00:08:08,896 --> 00:08:10,727
Speaker 0: It's the same game now of course

111
00:08:11,112 --> 00:08:25,259
Speaker 1: this brings up the interesting point that the heckler at Kineticon wouldn't let us get to while checkers is solved and done and a Person who theoretically knows the solved state and the ways to all the patterns leading up to the solved state Can never lose the game of checkers.

112
00:08:25,801 --> 00:08:33,269
Speaker 1: most people don't know this at all And as a result the game is still relatively strategic and tactical for those people.

113
00:08:33,952 --> 00:08:36,341
Speaker 1: So what it comes down to is a game.

114
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:42,429
Speaker 1: whether or not is solved is fun or not fun Depending on how much you have solved it relative to how much the other person is solved.

115
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:54,427
Speaker 1: That's why little kids have a lot of fun with tic-tac-toe And that's why me and Scott and pretty much everyone in the world who's intelligent Had a lot of fun with settlers of Catan for you know, two three years before they eventually solved it.

116
00:08:54,748 --> 00:09:03,602
Speaker 1: Yep So I guess the moral here is just because a game is solvable or We're down on a game because we solved it doesn't mean that game isn't awesome.

117
00:09:04,204 --> 00:09:06,110
Speaker 1: It just means we're done with it.

118
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,438
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's it the game over.

119
00:09:07,619 --> 00:09:09,329
Speaker 1: computers are done with checkers.

120
00:09:09,951 --> 00:09:11,476
Speaker 0: Computers aren't you done with checkers?

121
00:09:11,496 --> 00:09:14,064
Speaker 0: You know, they'll don't play checkers against the computer.

122
00:09:14,264 --> 00:09:16,110
Speaker 0: you the best you can hope for is to tie.

123
00:09:16,393 --> 00:09:21,560
Speaker 0: Yep, and that's if you play Perfectly with no mistakes one mistake you lose.

124
00:09:21,921 --> 00:09:23,166
Speaker 1: Yeah, apparently on this site.

125
00:09:23,206 --> 00:09:24,330
Speaker 1: They've solved a bunch of other things.

126
00:09:24,611 --> 00:09:25,677
Speaker 1: A worry is solved.

127
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:27,023
Speaker 1: I don't remember body.

128
00:09:27,385 --> 00:09:28,430
Speaker 1: I don't remember if that's the game.

129
00:09:28,511 --> 00:09:36,246
Speaker 1: I know or if I know Mancala, but I know one of the Connect for learn how to play Mancala actually connect four has been solved by multiple people.

130
00:09:36,728 --> 00:09:46,813
Speaker 0: Oh, okay I'm pretty sure I play connect for pretty close to solved I'm close, but I'm not great because the Linux computer on hard beats me about Pretty much.

131
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:52,150
Speaker 1: the only time I lose go is five by five solved and Othello is six by six solved.

132
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,376
Speaker 0: That's why we play big Othello.

133
00:09:54,437 --> 00:09:55,642
Speaker 1: God Othello is a good game.

134
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, I used to play that with my dad all the time.

135
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,656
Speaker 1: I don't think I ever beat him.

136
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:01,150
Speaker 0: I think of all the games of perfect information.

137
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,637
Speaker 0: Othello is a non randomness.

138
00:10:03,878 --> 00:10:05,525
Speaker 0: Othello is my my favorite.

139
00:10:05,626 --> 00:10:06,630
Speaker 1: I really do like Othello.

140
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,409
Speaker 1: Yeah, if I hadn't known Adam Cole as a kid, I probably would have liked chess a lot more.

141
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:16,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course, I think if you disk if you include the random perfect information games, I like the backgammon's.

142
00:10:17,691 --> 00:10:20,890
Speaker 1: See, I like backgammon's but there is a lot of randomness and there is a lot of it.

143
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:24,650
Speaker 1: It's pretty easy to make optimal move and it is easy to make optimal moves.

144
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:30,110
Speaker 0: But I also like in backgammon is the risk-taking going on, but the other games don't have so much true.

145
00:10:30,372 --> 00:10:31,761
Speaker 1: But then again, it's just odds playing.

146
00:10:31,842 --> 00:10:32,466
Speaker 1: It's one of those.

147
00:10:32,768 --> 00:10:36,449
Speaker 1: All right I have a 60% chance of this move being off being good.

148
00:10:36,831 --> 00:10:42,010
Speaker 1: However, if I take this move, there's a 30% chance that it'll completely fucking own the other guy.

149
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:45,662
Speaker 1: But a 20% chance that'll completely fucking own me and you know all these.

150
00:10:45,883 --> 00:10:46,103
Speaker 0: Yep.

151
00:10:46,144 --> 00:10:47,327
Speaker 0: That's exactly backgammon.

152
00:10:47,388 --> 00:10:47,909
Speaker 0: I kind of like it.

153
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,941
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, I think part of that is that's kind of how life is it?

154
00:10:51,664 --> 00:10:53,270
Speaker 1: Life is not a perfect information game.

155
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,400
Speaker 0: Life is like a backgammon?

156
00:10:54,944 --> 00:11:00,674
Speaker 1: Kinda I'd extend the analogy but I'm done with that.

157
00:11:00,835 --> 00:11:01,297
Speaker 1: All right.

158
00:11:01,739 --> 00:11:04,189
Speaker 0: I also like, you know, I mean, come on backgammon.

159
00:11:05,593 --> 00:11:07,077
Speaker 1: But seriously check out this site out.

160
00:11:07,297 --> 00:11:14,759
Speaker 1: and Lincoln Gannon if you think good God if you think this is pretty cool I'd recommend you try to read about game theory.

161
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,210
Speaker 1: All right warning if you don't like math you won't like game theory.

162
00:11:19,771 --> 00:11:28,110
Speaker 0: Okay, so I don't really have much news really but there's a whole bunch of video games out really recently and soon.

163
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:28,834
Speaker 0: You're ready for this?

164
00:11:28,934 --> 00:11:29,618
Speaker 1: Oh the video games.

165
00:11:29,638 --> 00:11:30,321
Speaker 1: We've got to buy them.

166
00:11:30,542 --> 00:11:30,904
Speaker 0: You ready?

167
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:31,749
Speaker 0: Here's the video games.

168
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:32,030
Speaker 0: You ready?

169
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:33,473
Speaker 0: I think yes.

170
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:38,470
Speaker 0: - well, first of all, I bought Planet Puzzle League for the DS which came out in early June.

171
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,613
Speaker 1: It's pretty freaking hot.

172
00:11:39,834 --> 00:11:47,730
Speaker 0: It's it's panel day pawn aka Tetris attack aka now granted Pokemon Puzzle League kind of bought it by accident.

173
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:53,670
Speaker 1: We were trying to leave Otakon to get to the beach and do our things at the beach But Scott decided he had to go shoe shopping.

174
00:11:53,771 --> 00:11:57,090
Speaker 1: So we dragged me and Pete into the mall and pranced around looking for shoes.

175
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:57,273
Speaker 0: I didn't.

176
00:11:57,314 --> 00:11:58,249
Speaker 1: I wait like an hour.

177
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:02,530
Speaker 0: I went to Foot Locker for like two seconds saw they had no shoes I wanted and walked out.

178
00:12:02,691 --> 00:12:08,970
Speaker 1: So Scott was prancing around looking for shoes But he couldn't find any you liked and I guess he couldn't find a matching handbag to go with the shoes.

179
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,236
Speaker 0: So he ended up not buying any.

180
00:12:11,276 --> 00:12:12,940
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, for less than 30 seconds.

181
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,730
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, me and Pete being men went over to the GameStop.

182
00:12:16,831 --> 00:12:19,730
Speaker 0: I went to the GameStop immediately after like 30 seconds.

183
00:12:19,851 --> 00:12:22,283
Speaker 1: Yeah, because the handbag didn't match the frickin shoes you wanted.

184
00:12:22,303 --> 00:12:23,670
Speaker 0: Because they sell handbags at Foot Locker.

185
00:12:26,031 --> 00:12:29,847
Speaker 1: Suffice to say Scott shoe shopping made us about an hour late to the show.

186
00:12:29,927 --> 00:12:32,110
Speaker 0: It made us like It was not what made us late.

187
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:36,323
Speaker 1: What made us late was the handbag not matching the shoes that you wanted.

188
00:12:36,343 --> 00:12:43,350
Speaker 1: The parking fee being an ass The parking fee might have been slightly less if you hadn't desperately and suddenly needed to buy shoes.

189
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,542
Speaker 0: The parking feed was not a result of my 30 seconds.

190
00:12:46,582 --> 00:12:48,750
Speaker 1: We drove 300 miles to an anime convention.

191
00:12:49,011 --> 00:12:51,921
Speaker 1: We were about to drive another hundred and something miles to the shore.

192
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:53,687
Speaker 0: And I spent 30 seconds in a Foot Locker.

193
00:12:53,787 --> 00:12:58,041
Speaker 1: And suddenly Suddenly Scott decides I need to buy shoes.

194
00:12:58,442 --> 00:13:00,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, I did because my sneakers are pretty much dead.

195
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,138
Speaker 0: I'm probably gonna replace them this weekend.

196
00:13:02,721 --> 00:13:04,087
Speaker 1: If only the handbag had matched.

197
00:13:04,288 --> 00:13:08,488
Speaker 0: Right Anyway How long are you gonna keep this up?

198
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:16,833
Speaker 1: You see you guys don't realize that Pete and I made fun of Scott along these lines for about four hours total non-consecutively.

199
00:13:16,853 --> 00:13:17,997
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

200
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:19,722
Speaker 1: Pretty much until my voice gave out.

201
00:13:19,742 --> 00:13:22,210
Speaker 0: Right, because I spent 30 seconds in a Foot Locker.

202
00:13:22,652 --> 00:13:24,140
Speaker 1: Well, the handbag wouldn't match.

203
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,044
Speaker 0: God damn it.

204
00:13:25,084 --> 00:13:26,150
Speaker 0: What the fuck's wrong with you?

205
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,650
Speaker 0: Are you sure you didn't take drugs before the show started?

206
00:13:29,752 --> 00:13:30,214
Speaker 1: I might have.

207
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:31,317
Speaker 0: Great.

208
00:13:31,638 --> 00:13:34,789
Speaker 1: I took a bunch of Sudafed and I had some rim summertime lemonade.

209
00:13:36,271 --> 00:13:37,436
Speaker 0: Aren't you not supposed to make those?

210
00:13:37,697 --> 00:13:41,092
Speaker 1: No, you're not supposed to mix Nyquil and rim summertime lemonade Uh-huh.

211
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:44,303
Speaker 1: Because Nyquil has acetaminophen in it, which is bad for your liver.

212
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,050
Speaker 0: But doesn't Nyquil also have alcohol in it?

213
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,275
Speaker 1: I didn't take Nyquil.

214
00:13:47,476 --> 00:13:47,757
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

215
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,184
Speaker 1: So it doesn't matter.

216
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:52,958
Speaker 0: Okay, so Pokemon puzzle- Pokemon puzzle.

217
00:13:53,018 --> 00:13:54,766
Speaker 0: Planet- Planet Puzzle League.

218
00:13:54,806 --> 00:13:55,610
Speaker 0: I got that, right?

219
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,153
Speaker 0: So that's out.

220
00:13:56,555 --> 00:13:57,661
Speaker 0: Picross DS.

221
00:13:57,721 --> 00:14:02,124
Speaker 0: If you never played, there was original- There's a game called Mario Picross for the original Game Boy.

222
00:14:02,224 --> 00:14:03,290
Speaker 1: A lot of people haven't played it.

223
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:06,260
Speaker 1: I'll admit that I had never heard of it or played it until Scott showed me about it.

224
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:12,556
Speaker 0: You can actually- you can go online and Someone made a Flash game.

225
00:14:12,616 --> 00:14:20,325
Speaker 0: If you just search on Google for Wii Picross, P-I-C-R-O-S-S They made a Flash game that you can play on the Wii.

226
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:22,511
Speaker 0: That's basically Picross.

227
00:14:23,474 --> 00:14:26,081
Speaker 0: And that's how you can learn what Picross is and how to play.

228
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:29,590
Speaker 0: And if you like that, then you should probably buy Picross.

229
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:35,107
Speaker 0: Basically, it's a puzzle, sort of like the ones you find in a puzzle book that you would buy in the newsstand.

230
00:14:35,588 --> 00:14:42,679
Speaker 0: And you try to basically decode this grid to create a picture that consists of pixels that are either on or off.

231
00:14:43,241 --> 00:14:44,825
Speaker 0: Another game you should pay attention to.

232
00:14:44,845 --> 00:14:49,399
Speaker 0: Oh, the first game for the Wii that I think is gonna be exciting.

233
00:14:50,082 --> 00:14:52,610
Speaker 0: Just today, or just tomorrow, I'm not sure.

234
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,217
Speaker 0: Mario Strikers Charge for the Wii.

235
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:55,839
Speaker 0: It's out.

236
00:14:56,019 --> 00:14:56,401
Speaker 0: US.

237
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,625
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

238
00:14:58,046 --> 00:14:59,090
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll buy it this weekend.

239
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:04,162
Speaker 1: We really should because we jumped on the old Mario Strikers bandwagon way too late.

240
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:04,864
Speaker 0: That's true.

241
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:13,558
Speaker 1: That game was pretty fantastic even though we both pretty much- Scott was better than me just because he played it more than me, but we pretty much dominated anyone else.

242
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:16,550
Speaker 1: we played against just because we played it slightly more than the rest of them.

243
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,149
Speaker 0: Yep, so if we get on this one early, it'll be pretty cool.

244
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:21,673
Speaker 0: Worms DS.

245
00:15:21,774 --> 00:15:25,247
Speaker 0: If you don't know, there was a Worms for the DS already, and it sucked.

246
00:15:25,267 --> 00:15:25,930
Speaker 1: It sucked ass!

247
00:15:26,612 --> 00:15:33,328
Speaker 1: That was one of the most disappointing things in the world because Worms always has the potential to be awesome, much like Scorched Earth was awesome.

248
00:15:33,489 --> 00:15:33,629
Speaker 1: Yep.

249
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:45,130
Speaker 0: So, Worms DS is supposed- is coming out on August 6th, the second Worms DS, and hopefully, it won't suck like the first Worms DS, and I guess we're just gonna have to wait and see on that one.

250
00:15:46,252 --> 00:15:47,528
Speaker 0: What other exciting games?

251
00:15:48,651 --> 00:15:52,366
Speaker 0: The Metroid game, I think, comes out towards the end of August, maybe.

252
00:15:52,387 --> 00:15:53,150
Speaker 0: I'm not quite sure.

253
00:15:53,330 --> 00:16:02,570
Speaker 1: I'm kind of excited just because I really don't like controlling games with the analog stick looking around, and if I can look around with a Wii stick, I'm all about that.

254
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:09,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll finally see how good the Wii is for FPSing and not with the stupid red whatever the the other one.

255
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:10,782
Speaker 1: Yeah, that game just came out.

256
00:16:10,883 --> 00:16:11,469
Speaker 0: It's a World War II game.

257
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:12,994
Speaker 1: Was it World War II?

258
00:16:13,235 --> 00:16:14,239
Speaker 0: There was a World War II game.

259
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:16,227
Speaker 1: Because there was that Yakuza game, Red Steel.

260
00:16:16,247 --> 00:16:16,930
Speaker 0: That's the Red Steel.

261
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,781
Speaker 0: Yeah, there were quite a- there are a few FPSes on the Wii, not so hot.

262
00:16:20,962 --> 00:16:26,309
Speaker 0: Hopefully, the Metroid will be hot, and yeah, there's some other games coming out.

263
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:37,874
Speaker 0: You should probably go on the internets and look at the release schedules because it's gonna basically slowly build up until the holiday season when you're gonna get the explosion, mostly with the Smash Brothers, but, you know.

264
00:16:37,974 --> 00:16:41,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is, we've been a little bit behind on the video games, haven't been buying the new ones.

265
00:16:42,295 --> 00:16:43,030
Speaker 0: Oh, right, I forgot.

266
00:16:44,532 --> 00:16:49,914
Speaker 0: I think I said on the show before that Paper Mario is out on the- the original Nintendo 64.

267
00:16:49,914 --> 00:16:51,459
Speaker 0: Paper Mario is out on the Wii.

268
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,001
Speaker 1: That is true.

269
00:16:52,021 --> 00:16:52,884
Speaker 1: For the Virtual Console.

270
00:16:52,984 --> 00:16:54,710
Speaker 1: There is, however, a much more important game.

271
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,176
Speaker 0: And that's probably worth buying.

272
00:16:56,236 --> 00:17:02,788
Speaker 0: However, just yesterday, they released Dynamite Headdy for the Wii Virtual Console.

273
00:17:02,848 --> 00:17:06,490
Speaker 0: Now, Dynamite Headdy is a game I had as a kid for the Sega Genesis.

274
00:17:07,053 --> 00:17:10,108
Speaker 0: And it's not a very well-known game, and you might be thinking, "What the fuck, Dynamite

275
00:17:10,127 --> 00:17:10,329
Speaker 0: Headdy?".

276
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,990
Speaker 0: I don't know, what the fuck is that shit, right?

277
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,741
Speaker 0: Dynamite Headdy is a game made by Treasure.

278
00:17:14,761 --> 00:17:21,510
Speaker 0: If you never heard of Treasure, you probably should have, because they're a game development house that sort of makes all these awesome games.

279
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:24,089
Speaker 0: They made Gunstar Heroes, which is also on Virtual Console.

280
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:30,466
Speaker 0: Dynamite Headdy, I would say, is one of maybe the best 10 2D platform games ever.

281
00:17:30,847 --> 00:17:31,610
Speaker 1: Let me put it this way.

282
00:17:32,231 --> 00:17:36,230
Speaker 1: I really didn't like the Sega Genesis, and I hated most of the games that came out on it.

283
00:17:36,651 --> 00:17:41,050
Speaker 1: However, this game, when Scott showed it to me, I had to respect it.

284
00:17:41,431 --> 00:17:44,030
Speaker 1: I feel a little bit bad for everything missed out on it as a kid.

285
00:17:44,451 --> 00:17:51,930
Speaker 0: You know, it's the walking and the jumping, and you basically, you're this guy with a head that's sort of detached, and you shoot your head at things in eight different directions.

286
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,270
Speaker 1: It's not as dumb as it sounds.

287
00:17:53,370 --> 00:18:05,310
Speaker 0: It's not as dumb as it sounds, and the theme of the world is like this big puppet world on a stage, and the things keep changing, and the music is cool, and the enemy, your nemesis, Trouble Bruin, is pretty cool.

288
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:16,330
Speaker 0: He's like this cat thing, and he always, at first, you fight him with his normal cat body, and then he attaches his head to all sorts of robots later on, and you have to play the game just to get the experience.

289
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,250
Speaker 0: Don't read any strategy guides or anything.

290
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:32,068
Speaker 0: Just play through, and it's really cool, and it's not like any other platform you've ever played, and when you switch all these different weird heads, and you find all these secrets, and you interact with the environment in weird ways, and it's a load of fun.

291
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:33,670
Speaker 0: Play Dynamite Headdy.

292
00:18:33,751 --> 00:18:36,348
Speaker 0: It's one of the only virtual console games worth your money.

293
00:18:43,231 --> 00:18:44,509
Speaker 1: Things of the day.

294
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:58,389
Speaker 1: So I thought this was somewhat interesting, and while there's a tiny chance it's not true, I know enough about criminals and prisons to know that they are some ingenious motherfuckers, and they come up with some elaborate ways.

295
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:03,050
Speaker 0: I mean, if you're- I think one of our earliest things of the day was the gallery of shivs, was it not?

296
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,789
Speaker 1: Not shavs, shivs.

297
00:19:05,014 --> 00:19:05,246
Speaker 0: Yes.

298
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,070
Speaker 1: You know what I like more than killing?

299
00:19:08,133 --> 00:19:08,550
Speaker 0: Stabbing?

300
00:19:08,778 --> 00:19:09,129
Speaker 0: Nothing.

301
00:19:10,331 --> 00:19:11,310
Speaker 1: Except maybe biscuits.

302
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,430
Speaker 1: God, I gotta find that prison funnies again.

303
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,929
Speaker 1: I didn't see it at the mocha this year, so I couldn't buy the next one.

304
00:19:17,773 --> 00:19:18,850
Speaker 0: Maybe you should look it up on the internet.

305
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:19,630
Speaker 1: I probably should.

306
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,009
Speaker 1: I didn't think of that until just now.

307
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,489
Speaker 1: I was reminded of it just now.

308
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:30,290
Speaker 1: But apparently, people in prisons, you know, they get a little bit of money, and they can buy little things sometimes to keep themselves company.

309
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:38,866
Speaker 1: They bought PS2s occasionally and video game systems, but the one system that everyone hated when they bought and they tried to keep them from getting was the N64.

310
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:47,330
Speaker 1: Because the N64's rumble pack could fairly easily be turned into a wicked awesome prison tattoo gun.

311
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:48,228
Speaker 0: Really?

312
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,589
Speaker 1: Quote, "It's actually pretty easy.

313
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,490
Speaker 1: There's no workshops in maximum security.

314
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:56,269
Speaker 1: They do it in their rooms with a battery power taped to a tube.

315
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:00,350
Speaker 1: The motor from the rumble is then taken out and attached to the top of the tube.

316
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,609
Speaker 1: A needle or pin is run down the middle of the tube.

317
00:20:03,091 --> 00:20:05,690
Speaker 1: When on, the needle will move up and down like a sewing machine.

318
00:20:06,095 --> 00:20:07,369
Speaker 1: The needle is then dipped in the ink.

319
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,801
Speaker 1: The ink is made from the ink inside of a ballpoint

320
00:20:09,822 --> 00:20:10,023
Speaker 1: pen.".

321
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:16,470
Speaker 0: That's a wonderful tattoo that I'm sure won't hurt at all or damage you permanently in any way.

322
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:23,470
Speaker 1: I don't think that just-- I don't think there's any prison tattoo that's not going to hurt a lot and not going to be bad for you in some way.

323
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:28,490
Speaker 0: Why don't they just have an actual tattoo parlor in the goddamn prison so that people could do it properly?

324
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:33,809
Speaker 1: Because most of the tattoos people get are to affiliate with their gang whatevers, and the prisons don't want to encourage that.

325
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:37,270
Speaker 1: Also, the prisons are generally kind of corrupt and broken in the US.

326
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:38,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

327
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,110
Speaker 1: But that's beside the point.

328
00:20:41,231 --> 00:20:48,310
Speaker 1: The point is, if you want to make yourself a custom prison tattoo, get yourself a rumble pack from an N64 and a ballpoint pen.

329
00:20:48,470 --> 00:21:02,610
Speaker 0: I think what it shows is that if you think that computer hackers or attackers in general do poorly in prison because they're weak and they'll get their asses beat and raped, probably not because they can come up with stuff like this ten times better than the prisoners can.

330
00:21:03,372 --> 00:21:05,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, think, these are not smart dudes in prison.

331
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,029
Speaker 1: If they were smart, they wouldn't be in prison.

332
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:08,889
Speaker 0: So imagine smart dudes in prison.

333
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,410
Speaker 1: Thing is, I still don't want to go to prison.

334
00:21:11,912 --> 00:21:15,910
Speaker 1: No, definitely not, but-- Yeah, you know that whole rather rule in hell than serve in heaven?

335
00:21:16,754 --> 00:21:18,310
Speaker 1: I wouldn't really care about ruling the prison.

336
00:21:18,733 --> 00:21:18,779
Speaker 0: No.

337
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:23,290
Speaker 0: All right, so, one of the hardest NES games I've ever played.

338
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:27,330
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not the hardest ever, period, but it's a damn fucking hard game.

339
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,769
Speaker 0: I mean, the game is basically a dick.

340
00:21:28,993 --> 00:21:29,969
Speaker 0: It's hard and long.

341
00:21:30,593 --> 00:21:31,490
Speaker 0: The game is Battletoad.

342
00:21:33,911 --> 00:21:38,890
Speaker 0: The game is Battletoads, and if you ever played Battletoads, you'll know what I'm talking about.

343
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,670
Speaker 0: And if you haven't played Battletoads, you should go play Battletoads.

344
00:21:43,154 --> 00:21:44,729
Speaker 0: It's a classic game everyone should play.

345
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:52,450
Speaker 1: The story behind Battletoads is very simply, Battletoads was a mediocre game, a little bit similar to like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade game.

346
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,390
Speaker 0: It was a walk sideways beat 'em up game.

347
00:21:54,430 --> 00:22:09,230
Speaker 1: But it also had a couple of cool modes and a couple of neat things, but basically it was mostly ignored, and a marketing effort, hitherto unseen by the likes of man, was brought forth by Nintendo through Nintendo Power, complete with comics.

348
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,930
Speaker 0: I don't think it was Nintendo specifically.

349
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:17,650
Speaker 1: Nintendo Power had this gigantic blitz of Battletoads is the best game ever.

350
00:22:17,991 --> 00:22:19,390
Speaker 0: They didn't make Battletoads, though.

351
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,870
Speaker 0: It wasn't a game made by Nintendo.

352
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,289
Speaker 1: But they pushed Battletoads.

353
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:27,170
Speaker 0: It was made by Rare, and Rare, I guess, paid everyone to push it off.

354
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:32,670
Speaker 1: Regardless of who paid for it, Nintendo and Nintendo Power pushed Battletoads more than they pushed the average game.

355
00:22:33,933 --> 00:22:42,910
Speaker 0: It was a heavily pushed game, and there were ads in every video game magazine, and I think there was a TV cartoon, and there was a whole bunch of stuff going on with Battletoads.

356
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,470
Speaker 1: The comic was particularly bad.

357
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:49,020
Speaker 1: The only thing I remember from it is the bad guy had a bumper sticker that said, "I, Club, and then

358
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,728
Speaker 1: Battletoads.".

359
00:22:50,151 --> 00:22:59,770
Speaker 0: Basically, the problem was that they wanted to beat Ninja Turtles, so they made Battletoads, and they pushed it as hard as they could, and it kind of worked, but it didn't beat Ninja Turtles.

360
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,209
Speaker 0: It just also succeeded on some level.

361
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:06,769
Speaker 1: The game had a lot of wacky, zany weirdness in it, and also a lot of really fucking hard jumps.

362
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,370
Speaker 0: Yep, and it was a good game anyway.

363
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:13,069
Speaker 0: I mean, it wasn't the greatest game, but it was a good game, and it's important to play Battletoads.

364
00:23:14,131 --> 00:23:17,130
Speaker 0: This video is a speedrun of Battletoads.

365
00:23:17,232 --> 00:23:17,730
Speaker 0: Hot damn.

366
00:23:17,851 --> 00:23:20,210
Speaker 0: It is not a perfect speedrun of Battletoads.

367
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:28,830
Speaker 0: The guy dies a few times, he does a few things sub-optimally, but it's still wicked, crazy, stupid fast, way faster than I could ever do it.

368
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:29,434
Speaker 1: What was it?

369
00:23:29,454 --> 00:23:30,284
Speaker 1: He beat it in like 25 minutes?

370
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:31,321
Speaker 0: 25 minutes.

371
00:23:32,152 --> 00:23:37,370
Speaker 1: It took me as a kid, like me and my little brother, I think four or five hours to actually beat the stupid game.

372
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,209
Speaker 0: Yep, so watch this.

373
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:45,750
Speaker 0: It's pretty amazing, and play Battletoads, and also watch this video, and play Battletoads, and watch the video.

374
00:23:46,453 --> 00:23:54,149
Speaker 1: So, a genre of gaming somewhat underserved nowadays, partly due to games that call themselves these, but are actually something else entirely.

375
00:23:54,711 --> 00:23:56,209
Speaker 1: Gonna talk a bit about the shmups.

376
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:09,309
Speaker 0: Well, actually, shmups, if you want to get, I don't know, depending on what facts you decide to agree upon, the shmup might be the oldest genre of video game, period.

377
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:10,549
Speaker 0: I mean, space war.

378
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:10,998
Speaker 1: Yep.

379
00:24:11,793 --> 00:24:12,350
Speaker 0: Space Invaders.

380
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:13,325
Speaker 0: There you go.

381
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:13,842
Speaker 1: Galaga.

382
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:17,330
Speaker 0: Galaga's a lot less old than Space Invaders.

383
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,069
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even so, it's older than most people.

384
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:19,810
Speaker 0: Galaxian.

385
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:20,399
Speaker 1: Yeah.

386
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,669
Speaker 0: You know, the prequel to Galaga.

387
00:24:23,071 --> 00:24:24,570
Speaker 1: You know, I've never actually played Galaxian.

388
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:26,210
Speaker 0: You've never played Galaxian?

389
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,290
Speaker 1: Nah, I've seen it, just never bothered playing it.

390
00:24:28,372 --> 00:24:28,806
Speaker 0: You know...

391
00:24:30,873 --> 00:24:31,489
Speaker 1: I've seen it.

392
00:24:31,631 --> 00:24:31,950
Speaker 0: With the bats.

393
00:24:32,231 --> 00:24:33,910
Speaker 1: I know, I've seen a lot of people play it.

394
00:24:34,051 --> 00:24:35,269
Speaker 0: I've played so much Galaxian.

395
00:24:35,832 --> 00:24:36,810
Speaker 1: I've played a lot more Galaga.

396
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:40,430
Speaker 0: I've played a lot of Galaga too, but I've played so much Galaxian.

397
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,990
Speaker 0: You've never played a single Galaxian?

398
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,770
Speaker 1: You know what, I've played a lot more than all those games combined.

399
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:46,810
Speaker 0: Galaxian on Windows 3.1 in the Microsoft Arcade Pack.

400
00:24:46,972 --> 00:24:47,428
Speaker 1: GigaWing.

401
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:48,483
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

402
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:49,308
Speaker 0: Great.

403
00:24:50,111 --> 00:24:50,564
Speaker 0: Alright, so.

404
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,050
Speaker 0: Shmups are pretty damn cool.

405
00:24:53,271 --> 00:24:54,389
Speaker 1: Should we define shmup?

406
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:55,669
Speaker 0: You want to define shmup?

407
00:24:55,811 --> 00:24:56,090
Speaker 0: Alright.

408
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:04,947
Speaker 0: The thing is, if you want to be non-so-strict with your interpretation of the word shmup, it's a shoot 'em up.

409
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:12,209
Speaker 0: So you could consider something like, I don't know, Gunstar Heroes or... What's that name?

410
00:25:12,953 --> 00:25:14,710
Speaker 0: I forget the game for the Super Nintendo.

411
00:25:16,152 --> 00:25:17,310
Speaker 1: R-Type, Gradius?

412
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:19,029
Speaker 0: No, no, no, those are obviously shmups.

413
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,650
Speaker 0: The one where the guy walks sideways.

414
00:25:21,897 --> 00:25:22,530
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

415
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:23,108
Speaker 1: Yeah.

416
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:28,588
Speaker 1: There was that prototype game that everyone has a ROM of, of a superhero that flies sideways or walks sideways, but...

417
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:28,857
Speaker 0: No.

418
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:38,670
Speaker 0: But depending on how liberal you are with your definitions, there are a lot of games that you could consider to be shmups that aren't actually space shmups, specifically.

419
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:49,549
Speaker 1: Yeah, generally the way I take a shmup is a game that either topscrolls or sidescrolls, and you have some sort of craft, and the craft moves around, and you can shoot projectiles out of the craft and possibly power the craft up.

420
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,590
Speaker 0: Oh, what about like, uh, Pocky and Rocky?

421
00:25:52,532 --> 00:25:57,910
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah, Pocky and Rocky looks like a mystical ninja kind of game, but it's actually a shmup, really.

422
00:25:58,294 --> 00:25:58,587
Speaker 0: Sort of.

423
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:59,628
Speaker 1: The way it plays it is.

424
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:10,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's basically a game where you shoot things, you move around in two or two... I mean, well, I guess, is it... Can you... Is any 3D game a shmup?

425
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:10,500
Speaker 0: I mean...

426
00:26:10,854 --> 00:26:11,188
Speaker 1: I don't know.

427
00:26:11,331 --> 00:26:12,866
Speaker 1: You could make a 3D-ish shmup, but...

428
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:14,449
Speaker 0: I mean, is Descent a shmup?

429
00:26:14,911 --> 00:26:15,549
Speaker 1: See, I wouldn't think so.

430
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:18,170
Speaker 1: I'd call that an FPS, partly because you're in the first person there.

431
00:26:18,571 --> 00:26:21,069
Speaker 1: In shmups, you're always in the third person, straight up.

432
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:24,990
Speaker 0: Oh, but what if you played Descent with the third person camera, which you can do?

433
00:26:25,633 --> 00:26:25,910
Speaker 1: I don't know.

434
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:33,190
Speaker 1: I wouldn't... See, I personally wouldn't consider it a shmup, but I'm not the kind of person who would argue over the, uh, minute details of the term shmup.

435
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:48,610
Speaker 0: Yes, but basically, a shmup is a game that involves moving, uh, something around the screen and having that thing not get hit by bullets while shooting things at... The primary thing you do in the game is shoot and dodge.

436
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:54,010
Speaker 0: Shooting bad guys with projectiles while dodging enemies and the projectiles they shoot.

437
00:26:54,190 --> 00:27:00,470
Speaker 1: I think some of the best examples I can think of are games like Gradius, R-Type, uh, 1942.

438
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,710
Speaker 0: Life Force, UN Squadron.

439
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,770
Speaker 0: Ikaruga, Space Invaders.

440
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, even though Ikaruga sucks.

441
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:11,069
Speaker 0: Space Invaders, Einhonder.

442
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:12,240
Speaker 1: Giga Wing.

443
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,010
Speaker 0: Darius and all of its incarnations.

444
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,189
Speaker 1: All those Raiden games.

445
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:16,918
Speaker 0: Raiden, yeah.

446
00:27:17,493 --> 00:27:18,030
Speaker 1: UN Squadron.

447
00:27:18,531 --> 00:27:19,310
Speaker 0: I said UN Squadron.

448
00:27:19,531 --> 00:27:20,309
Speaker 1: I wasn't listening at all.

449
00:27:20,611 --> 00:27:21,250
Speaker 0: Oh, good job.

450
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,211
Speaker 1: Well, Area 88.

451
00:27:22,211 --> 00:27:23,630
Speaker 0: At least I think I said UN Squadron.

452
00:27:23,871 --> 00:27:25,210
Speaker 1: You better have, I love that game.

453
00:27:25,654 --> 00:27:25,808
Speaker 1: Yes.

454
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,289
Speaker 1: I never beat that game, but I love it.

455
00:27:27,531 --> 00:27:28,390
Speaker 0: I never beat it either.

456
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:30,190
Speaker 0: Raptor Call of the Shadows.

457
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,809
Speaker 1: Oh, that game is like the best one ever.

458
00:27:33,136 --> 00:27:33,390
Speaker 0: Yeah.

459
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:33,926
Speaker 1: At least for me.

460
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:35,280
Speaker 1: But anyway.

461
00:27:35,672 --> 00:27:37,269
Speaker 1: I'll admit that I was never good at these games.

462
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,608
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm good at some of them, but not all of them.

463
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:46,570
Speaker 0: And uh, yeah, shmups are pretty cool because they're basically a test of pure dexterity.

464
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:47,890
Speaker 1: Did you say Legendary Wings?

465
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:48,669
Speaker 0: No.

466
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:49,370
Speaker 1: You should have.

467
00:27:49,633 --> 00:27:49,910
Speaker 0: Okay.

468
00:27:50,012 --> 00:27:50,669
Speaker 1: I like that game.

469
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:53,450
Speaker 0: It's all about dexterity and hand-eye coordination.

470
00:27:53,690 --> 00:28:02,690
Speaker 0: You got a whole bunch of shit on the screen, you're moving a guy around to avoid it, but you're also trying to shoot all the things on the screen that are making stuff to avoid.

471
00:28:03,672 --> 00:28:08,770
Speaker 0: And, you know, depending on the shmup, this works in different ways because, you know, what if you shoot diagonally?

472
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,090
Speaker 0: You got to move in such a way.

473
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:15,170
Speaker 0: What if there's way too many, some like, look at R-Type compared to Gradius, right?

474
00:28:16,011 --> 00:28:26,230
Speaker 0: R-Type is actually quite difficult because it's all about precisely moving your craft and you have this sort of sub shield thing that you can shoot and move around the screen.

475
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,530
Speaker 0: And it's all about when do you release the shield?

476
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:30,969
Speaker 0: When do you call the shield back?

477
00:28:31,473 --> 00:28:37,389
Speaker 0: Use the shield in a clever way to kill a bad guy quickly, but bring it back quick enough so that the other bad guys don't get you.

478
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:46,449
Speaker 0: You know, when the terrain of the screen moves around in such a way, you know, stand in the exact right spot and make very small precise movements not to get hit.

479
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:57,909
Speaker 0: Whereas Gradius is more shoot the bad guys, be in the right position to shoot them, make them get a lot, a lot of power ups and use your options to kill everything really fast before you get hit.

480
00:28:58,311 --> 00:29:09,130
Speaker 1: Or then there's games like Ikaruga, which are basically a memorize the exact sequence of moves you must make to get the highest score on this level, then memorize the exact sequence of moves to get a high score on the next level.

481
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:22,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, Ikaruga is interesting in that it has the mechanic of when you push a button, you switch from black to white and when you're black, black things can't hit you and your black weapon hurts white bad guys more.

482
00:29:22,632 --> 00:29:29,469
Speaker 0: And when you switch to white, white things can't hurt you and your white weapon hurts black bad guys more.

483
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,910
Speaker 0: And when you kill bad guys, they release little pellets.

484
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:38,869
Speaker 0: And if you absorb them because you're the same color as the pellets, then you power up your super weapon.

485
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:41,850
Speaker 0: So you'll see R-type masters.

486
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:47,450
Speaker 0: Usually what they do is they'll switch colors, collect a bunch of pellets, release the super weapon, switch colors, release a bunch of pellets.

487
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,309
Speaker 1: I believe you mean Ikaruga.

488
00:29:48,811 --> 00:29:49,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, Ikaruga, right.

489
00:29:49,912 --> 00:29:50,369
Speaker 0: What did I say?

490
00:29:50,635 --> 00:29:50,890
Speaker 1: R-type.

491
00:29:51,273 --> 00:29:51,970
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

492
00:29:52,492 --> 00:29:53,990
Speaker 0: R-type masters are much better than that.

493
00:29:54,401 --> 00:29:54,648
Speaker 1: Yes.

494
00:29:55,430 --> 00:30:01,370
Speaker 1: Thing is, it's kind of enjoyable to watch a person play Ikaruga, but I tried to play it a bunch of times and it wasn't fun.

495
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,909
Speaker 1: I pretty much just have to play it and memorize what I had to do.

496
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:08,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, basically Ikaruga on paper is an awesome shmup.

497
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:12,363
Speaker 0: The problem is you can't play it the same way.

498
00:30:12,383 --> 00:30:14,050
Speaker 0: you play a shmup and it's not fun.

499
00:30:14,891 --> 00:30:24,109
Speaker 0: It lacks what makes the other shmups fun, which is just sort of trying to escape the bullets, not get hit, try to freewheel it, get to the end.

500
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:27,310
Speaker 0: Because the way you get more points is to do these combos.

501
00:30:27,851 --> 00:30:31,370
Speaker 0: And the levels are exactly the same thing every time.

502
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:36,690
Speaker 0: And it really does, the way to play and win is to memorize exactly what to do.

503
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:41,970
Speaker 0: The game even has demo mode where it shows you what to do in a near optimal way.

504
00:30:42,151 --> 00:30:45,610
Speaker 0: And then you copy or memorize what the game did and you try to do it yourself.

505
00:30:46,231 --> 00:30:51,190
Speaker 1: See, the sad thing is I feel like that is the direction that almost all Japanese shmups are going these days.

506
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:55,130
Speaker 1: Every video I see of the end of some shmup is something along those lines.

507
00:30:55,290 --> 00:31:05,790
Speaker 1: Like the absolute perfect precise, this is the one pixel of my ship that can be hit and I'm slowly moving it left and right to avoid the billion billion billion billion projectiles in the precise manner.

508
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:06,250
Speaker 1: Yep.

509
00:31:06,492 --> 00:31:07,188
Speaker 0: I hate that.

510
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,068
Speaker 0: It's not fun.

511
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:17,549
Speaker 0: It's much more fun for there to be a lot, but not too many projectiles where you can sort of look at the screen and react quick enough based on what you see.

512
00:31:18,152 --> 00:31:26,270
Speaker 0: You know, even if it's you need to have a very quick reaction to succeed, you know, to avoid things and also have a weapon powerful enough to destroy the bad guys.

513
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:32,010
Speaker 0: I don't want my not so powerful and so large that you just kill all the bad guys without doing anything and it's boring.

514
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:35,849
Speaker 1: I don't want my shmup to be like that stupid piece of pizza and turtles that you just can't get.

515
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:36,747
Speaker 0: Exactly.

516
00:31:37,071 --> 00:31:44,030
Speaker 1: I don't want there to be a piece of pizza that I could only have gotten if I knew to stay near the bottom of the screen exactly 27.8 seconds into the third level.

517
00:31:44,363 --> 00:31:44,509
Speaker 1: Yes.

518
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:49,410
Speaker 0: Now there are actually a lot of newer shmups that are sort of doing interesting things.

519
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,350
Speaker 0: There's that Japanese guy, I forget his name.

520
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:53,930
Speaker 0: He's the, he's sort of an independent shmup developer.

521
00:31:54,030 --> 00:32:01,610
Speaker 0: And the one game that he's made that's pretty popular is to Miki fighters, which is you shoot bad guys and they're made of blocks.

522
00:32:02,051 --> 00:32:08,649
Speaker 0: And then as the bad guys are dying, you crash into their broken ships and they become part of your ship.

523
00:32:09,192 --> 00:32:13,549
Speaker 0: And that sort of adds to your arsenal, but it adds to your size as well.

524
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:16,930
Speaker 1: See, I love stuff like that in jet and shmups or any other kind of game.

525
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:21,130
Speaker 1: I really like a good way to progress, especially an interesting way.

526
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:25,790
Speaker 1: I think that's why I like Kirby so much because it captures some new bad guy and I get some cool new power to you.

527
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:32,969
Speaker 0: That's why G Darius is so cool because in G Darius, you have the third weapon, which allows you to grab bad guys and bring them over to your team.

528
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:36,810
Speaker 0: And you can have any bad guy pretty much on your team at a time.

529
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:41,169
Speaker 0: You can only have one bad guy at a time, but pretty much anything that's not a boss you can grab.

530
00:32:41,531 --> 00:32:49,250
Speaker 0: So you always wait for those sort of mid boss enemies and you use them to destroy and then you carry them around with you for the rest of the level dealing insane damages.

531
00:32:49,611 --> 00:32:50,207
Speaker 1: I love that.

532
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:57,769
Speaker 0: Yeah, but G Darius is a good one, but Darius games are fun because all the bad guys are big robotic fish and it's always funny.

533
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:01,070
Speaker 1: See, I was just in general, never very good at shmups.

534
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:04,270
Speaker 1: And the only ones I really played a lot were like the Battle of Midway.

535
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,228
Speaker 1: I played a lot because I actually owned it.

536
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:09,169
Speaker 1: And Legendary Wings, which I rented three times.

537
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:10,730
Speaker 0: I never heard of Legendary Wings.

538
00:33:10,831 --> 00:33:11,962
Speaker 1: It was on the NES or SNES.

539
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:13,210
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

540
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,370
Speaker 1: Angels, Flying Wings, SHMUP.

541
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:16,030
Speaker 0: Yep.

542
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:21,250
Speaker 0: Oh, there's, um, what's the one where it's half SHMUP, half like RPG?

543
00:33:22,314 --> 00:33:23,370
Speaker 1: Oh, you can't remember.

544
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,607
Speaker 0: Guardian, Guardian Legends.

545
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,010
Speaker 1: That game, I can't believe I forgot the name of it for a second.

546
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:33,166
Speaker 1: The game was impossible, but at the same time, that game was like this wonderful mystery to me.

547
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:36,993
Speaker 1: And as a kid, I spent so many hours trying to solve it and figure out what was going on.

548
00:33:37,451 --> 00:33:39,870
Speaker 1: And I never got very far because I wasn't good at the SHMUP part.

549
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:41,150
Speaker 0: Does Sinistar count?

550
00:33:42,094 --> 00:33:42,488
Speaker 1: I don't know.

551
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,570
Speaker 1: Sinistar is really kind of a unique game.

552
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:47,630
Speaker 0: It is a unique game, and it's hard to say if it's a SHMUP or not.

553
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:50,790
Speaker 0: Basically, I can't believe, have we ever talked about Sinistar on the show?

554
00:33:51,712 --> 00:33:54,450
Speaker 1: If we have or if we haven't, we're going to do it at some point in the future.

555
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,290
Speaker 0: I don't think we should spoil it.

556
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:56,130
Speaker 0: We should do a whole show on Sinistar.

557
00:33:56,292 --> 00:33:56,400
Speaker 1: Yeah.

558
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:59,610
Speaker 1: All I want to say is I would love to see Sinistar remade.

559
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:10,009
Speaker 0: Sinistar is a very old arcade game that is semi-unknown, semi-infamous, very awesome, easily turned into 4chan memes.

560
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,130
Speaker 1: I hunger.

561
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:13,016
Speaker 1: I live.

562
00:34:13,811 --> 00:34:14,529
Speaker 0: Run, coward.

563
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:16,029
Speaker 0: Run, run, run.

564
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:26,047
Speaker 0: Basically, Sinistar had this digitized voice of the things that Sinistar said, and Sinistar said some funny things like "I hunger" and "Beware, I

565
00:34:26,109 --> 00:34:26,310
Speaker 0: live.".

566
00:34:27,134 --> 00:34:27,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, Sinistar.

567
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:29,489
Speaker 0: It's sort of a SHMUP, but not really.

568
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:32,909
Speaker 1: Our friend Pete is probably the only person I know personally who's actually good at that game.

569
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:33,808
Speaker 0: I'm okay at it.

570
00:34:34,295 --> 00:34:34,748
Speaker 0: I practiced.

571
00:34:35,431 --> 00:34:36,449
Speaker 0: I can get some Cinnabombs.

572
00:34:37,152 --> 00:34:38,489
Speaker 0: And yes, they are called Cinnabombs.

573
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,248
Speaker 1: Not Cinnabons.

574
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,649
Speaker 0: No, not Cinnabons.

575
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:42,605
Speaker 0: Cinnabombs.

576
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,409
Speaker 0: Like boom, but cinnamon.

577
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:49,206
Speaker 1: Granted, that one lady we met at that rest stop back there could have used some Cinnabombs instead.

578
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:50,268
Speaker 0: Yeah, she could have.

579
00:34:50,971 --> 00:34:53,389
Speaker 1: I think she was trying to build the Sinistar inside of herself.

580
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:55,049
Speaker 0: I think she already was the Sinistar.

581
00:34:55,391 --> 00:34:56,029
Speaker 1: She was big enough.

582
00:34:56,811 --> 00:34:58,829
Speaker 0: So, what else is there to say about SHMUPs?

583
00:34:59,812 --> 00:35:09,550
Speaker 0: Uh, SHMUPs, I like them because it's sort of a game where I can use, I can just pick it up and play it at any time with no worries.

584
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:14,282
Speaker 0: It's a lot of fun to keep getting power-ups that make my weapon bigger and bigger and bigger.

585
00:35:15,051 --> 00:35:23,629
Speaker 0: And it's a lot of fun to just dodge things and shoot things, you know, and where the simple controls of move around and shoot and that's it.

586
00:35:24,091 --> 00:35:25,350
Speaker 1: So, it's kind of the Jerry Seinfeld thing.

587
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,429
Speaker 1: Moving around, shooting around.

588
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:32,670
Speaker 0: Moving around, shooting around and it's a simple control, but the actual game is very advanced and complex.

589
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:36,010
Speaker 0: You have to move in complex patterns and see what's coming up.

590
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:49,008
Speaker 0: In a way, it's sort of like DDR and you have these arrows coming at you and you have to sort of push these very few buttons in a pattern, you know, in a correct way that you can match the pattern.

591
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:58,970
Speaker 1: Actually, what I really like and what I want to see more of, particularly on the DS with the Wi-Fi or in the wireless, is some sort of versus or cooperative many-player shmuping.

592
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,070
Speaker 0: Well, there's that, what was the one?

593
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:01,949
Speaker 1: The one on the Xbox?

594
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:02,687
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

595
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,509
Speaker 0: The one that's on the DS.

596
00:36:06,495 --> 00:36:08,490
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that nanostray game.

597
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:13,329
Speaker 0: I'm not sure if that has multiplayer, but I heard that the second one might have some multiplayer.

598
00:36:13,916 --> 00:36:14,730
Speaker 0: So, that's pretty cool.

599
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:15,195
Speaker 1: Oh, go ahead.

600
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,330
Speaker 1: I just remembered something.

601
00:36:17,771 --> 00:36:27,569
Speaker 0: A lot of older shmups have co-op play, which is also something interesting because back in those days, the only games with co-op play were beat-em-ups and shoot-em-ups, pretty much em-ups.

602
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:33,870
Speaker 0: You would either, two people would walk down the street beating stuff up or two people would fly through space shooting bad guys together.

603
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:39,410
Speaker 0: And as time went on, the co-op shmups kind of went away.

604
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:41,490
Speaker 1: Well, co-op gaming kind of went away.

605
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:44,148
Speaker 0: Yeah, now it's sort of back and coming back, but...

606
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:50,848
Speaker 1: I think the Xbox has a lot to do with that because a lot of the best co-op gaming was always on the PC and now the Xbox and Xbox Live...

607
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:55,129
Speaker 0: Co-op gaming was always on the NES, where the shmups and the beat-em-ups were.

608
00:36:55,951 --> 00:36:58,830
Speaker 0: And then the SNES not so much and the Genesis a little bit.

609
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:03,530
Speaker 0: And then when you got to the N64 in the 3D days, the co-op gaming was pretty much gone.

610
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:08,450
Speaker 1: Too many games became just that player one, player two, player one.

611
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:19,170
Speaker 0: And then all the 3D games on the PlayStation and the N64 and stuff were all 3D games that had split-screen multiplayer, but no co-op action.

612
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:28,190
Speaker 1: What I just remembered is, and I gotta remember the name of it, but at Otacon in the far left of the video game room, we saw a game that was like this versus shmup.

613
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:34,669
Speaker 1: Kind of like those puzzle-y fond games, but you pick a cute little girl and you fly the cute little girls against each other.

614
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:38,310
Speaker 1: And depending on how well you shmup, it puts bad guys on the other person's screen.

615
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:47,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know how you play like a puzzle game against someone and when you do better, it puts more crap on the other person's screen.

616
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:50,930
Speaker 1: You set up the combo and then you blow it off and then they get screwed unless they counter it and all that stuff.

617
00:37:51,111 --> 00:37:53,230
Speaker 1: It was that, but it was a shmup with cute girls.

618
00:37:53,974 --> 00:37:56,290
Speaker 0: You picked, it looked like witches, basically.

619
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:59,758
Speaker 0: And you picked a witch.

620
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:02,687
Speaker 0: and I guess depending on which witch you picked, yeah.

621
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:08,708
Speaker 0: Depending on which witch you selected, it would send different bad guys over to the other side.

622
00:38:09,411 --> 00:38:17,630
Speaker 0: And you played a shmup on your side and the more bad guys you killed and the better you played, the harder it made it for the other person.

623
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:22,266
Speaker 0: And if they cleared out the stuff that they got sent over, then it sent worse stuff over to you.

624
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:25,910
Speaker 0: And it was pretty cool and I kind of wanted to play it, but there was a line.

625
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:26,870
Speaker 1: There wasn't a line.

626
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:31,469
Speaker 1: I was about to say we really wanted to play it, but there was just this guy sitting there playing it.

627
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,606
Speaker 0: And there was another guy there, too.

628
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,070
Speaker 1: There's two guys, but there was no one else.

629
00:38:35,111 --> 00:38:36,349
Speaker 1: And those two just kept playing it.

630
00:38:36,471 --> 00:38:37,510
Speaker 1: And eventually we walked away.

631
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:44,130
Speaker 1: Thing is, though, that's a wider gripe I have about pretty much every convention other than the classic gaming at Katsucon.

632
00:38:44,851 --> 00:38:51,350
Speaker 1: It seems like there's really no enforcement of any sort of etiquette of, all right, let someone else play the goddamn game.

633
00:38:51,890 --> 00:39:02,010
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is, when you go to an arcade or if you're in a place with like relatively few games, there is sort of an etiquette about getting up from the game.

634
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:06,170
Speaker 1: But no one follows that anymore, at least depending on what people do follow it.

635
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:15,587
Speaker 0: The problem is, is that when you have a big convention, most people do follow the etiquette of, you know, you play a game, you know, maybe the loser walks in a fighting game or something like that.

636
00:39:16,551 --> 00:39:35,510
Speaker 0: But when you're at a big convention like that, right, the people who do not there are people out there who don't follow the etiquette, the type of people who will play a demo game for an hour and not leave it right at an anime convention or any other sort of gaming convention with, you know, some sort of shared console game that is publicly and freely playable.

637
00:39:36,191 --> 00:39:40,010
Speaker 0: Those are the types of people who are going to go to the game room and stay there a long time.

638
00:39:40,271 --> 00:39:43,508
Speaker 0: Also, the types of people who are going to sit down at a game and not get up.

639
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:56,765
Speaker 0: And when you have a big convention and not so many games, odds are those kind of people, you know, if there's 100 of them at the con, they're all going to be sitting at a game system, taking it up.

640
00:39:57,252 --> 00:39:59,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't help that those people tend to be oblivious to other people.

641
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:04,589
Speaker 1: I just think cons what they need to do in the very least, because there are disagreements over what the etiquette is.

642
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:10,490
Speaker 1: I mean, I've been to arcades where I put a quarter up to play DDR and someone stares at me like, what the fuck are you doing with that quarter?

643
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:11,222
Speaker 0: Yep.

644
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,430
Speaker 1: You got to just have rules posted somewhere.

645
00:40:14,732 --> 00:40:15,569
Speaker 1: You don't enforce them.

646
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:17,669
Speaker 0: I found out the name of the versus Shmoop.

647
00:40:17,972 --> 00:40:18,629
Speaker 1: What's it called?

648
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:20,030
Speaker 0: Twinkle Star Sprites.

649
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,327
Speaker 1: What systems is it for?

650
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,088
Speaker 0: Neo Geo Saturn Dreamcast PS2.

651
00:40:25,054 --> 00:40:26,186
Speaker 1: I think we got to buy a PS2.

652
00:40:26,931 --> 00:40:28,489
Speaker 1: That's like four games I want now.

653
00:40:29,371 --> 00:40:35,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's a versus Shmoop where you pick a cute girly character and you Shmoop.

654
00:40:35,872 --> 00:40:40,830
Speaker 1: And yeah, see, I love those puzzle games already for the same, almost the same reasons.

655
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,750
Speaker 1: This game, I think, would be really cool.

656
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:45,770
Speaker 0: And I think I think someone needs to make a versus Shmoop for the DS.

657
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:46,449
Speaker 0: That's what we need.

658
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:49,649
Speaker 1: I think someone needs to make some sort of epic versus Shmoop for the DS.

659
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:52,930
Speaker 1: Some sort of Wi-Fi enabled leaderboard rankings.

660
00:40:53,978 --> 00:40:54,469
Speaker 1: I can dream.

661
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:59,549
Speaker 0: So if you had to pick one Shmoop forever, Giga Wing, Giga Wing, Giga Wing.

662
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:00,050
Speaker 1: All right.

663
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:00,634
Speaker 1: I think.

664
00:41:00,755 --> 00:41:01,990
Speaker 1: or after Call of the Shadows.

665
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:06,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I would just pick Galaga one because Galaga.

666
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:10,989
Speaker 0: The thing is, Galaga is actually a really interesting game that people don't seem to fully understand.

667
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:14,550
Speaker 0: Galaga, you're a little ship at the bottom and there's bad guys at the top.

668
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:17,550
Speaker 0: And it's not like Galaxian or Space Invaders.

669
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:19,810
Speaker 0: So the bad guys are there when you start the level.

670
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:24,710
Speaker 0: The bad guys fly into the screen one row at a time.

671
00:41:25,091 --> 00:41:28,810
Speaker 0: So it's like you're sitting there with a blank slate and a row of bad guys comes in.

672
00:41:29,011 --> 00:41:39,150
Speaker 0: While they're coming in, if you position yourself properly, you can kill all or a lot of them very quickly because they're all in a line and they all follow the same path.

673
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:43,370
Speaker 0: So if you shoot at the right spot in their path, you can hit a lot of them with bullets.

674
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:46,489
Speaker 0: Then whichever ones remain alive line up at the top.

675
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:54,809
Speaker 0: And after all the bad guys come in, they sort of go back and forth and then they'll take turns diving down at you the same way they do in Galaxian until you kill them all.

676
00:41:55,352 --> 00:41:59,450
Speaker 0: The thing in Galaga that makes it special is the ship capture.

677
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:08,109
Speaker 0: See, there are these bug bad guys in Galaga and that when they dive down at you, sometimes they'll spray this like wave beam at you.

678
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:13,929
Speaker 0: And most people go, oh, snaps wave beam and they dodge it or they kill the bad guy that's shooting the wave beam.

679
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:21,007
Speaker 0: Little do they know, if you have a life remaining and you get hit by the wave beam, you don't die.

680
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:26,923
Speaker 0: Well, you do die, you lose a life, but it captures your ship and your ship is now a bad guy.

681
00:42:27,571 --> 00:42:31,730
Speaker 0: But when you come back to life, you have a chance to shoot the bad guy.

682
00:42:31,991 --> 00:42:38,610
Speaker 0: And if you do not shoot your ship and you shoot the bad guy, you will now have two ships simultaneously.

683
00:42:38,994 --> 00:42:40,490
Speaker 1: On one hand, double the firepower.

684
00:42:40,793 --> 00:42:42,690
Speaker 1: On the other hand, double the surface area.

685
00:42:42,976 --> 00:42:43,147
Speaker 0: Yep.

686
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:46,289
Speaker 0: Your ship is now twice as wide as it normally is.

687
00:42:46,611 --> 00:42:50,390
Speaker 0: So it's much harder to dodge things and you basically sacrifice the life.

688
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:53,890
Speaker 0: But you can shoot two bullets side by side at once.

689
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,270
Speaker 0: And that's crazy awesome.

690
00:42:56,091 --> 00:43:02,770
Speaker 0: So Galaga is actually a very deep game and it plays forever the same way Space Invaders or Galaxian plays forever.

691
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:04,790
Speaker 0: And it's way cool.

692
00:43:05,071 --> 00:43:05,709
Speaker 0: I like it a lot.

693
00:43:06,231 --> 00:43:06,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, awesome.

694
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:08,429
Speaker 0: It's going to be out on the DS soon.

695
00:43:08,651 --> 00:43:09,810
Speaker 0: The Namco Arcade is coming.

696
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:10,868
Speaker 1: I'm waiting for that.

697
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:14,130
Speaker 1: I mean, weren't you going to buy the game on the virtual console until you saw that?

698
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:15,829
Speaker 0: Pretty much it happened the same day.

699
00:43:15,991 --> 00:43:18,629
Speaker 0: I was going to buy Galaga for the virtual console for five bucks.

700
00:43:19,192 --> 00:43:22,927
Speaker 0: And the next day I saw Namco Museum for DS.

701
00:43:24,011 --> 00:43:25,309
Speaker 0: And I said, well, I'll just wait for that then.

702
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:27,389
Speaker 1: I'm pretty much going to buy that the day it comes out.

703
00:43:27,651 --> 00:43:29,068
Speaker 0: I'm also going to buy it the day it comes out.

704
00:43:29,751 --> 00:43:30,670
Speaker 0: Do we really need two copies?

705
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:34,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, because that's the kind of game that I'll just play on my own like Tetris.

706
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:41,570
Speaker 1: I mean, some games like Bomberman or the puzzle game, only one person in your crew needs to own the game and then everyone download plays.

707
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:46,989
Speaker 1: But for a game like that, I kind of want it for the single player to kill time when I'm standing in line at the bank or whatever.

708
00:43:47,253 --> 00:43:48,367
Speaker 0: Yep, that's what I need it for.

709
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:49,710
Speaker 0: Hi.

710
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:52,370
Speaker 0: Anything else to say about shmups or should we go eat dinner?

711
00:43:52,512 --> 00:43:53,449
Speaker 1: I think we should go eat dinner.

712
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:56,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a lot of shmups are an awesome game genre.

713
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:59,149
Speaker 0: There's a lot of free shmups out there.

714
00:43:59,791 --> 00:44:05,990
Speaker 0: If you've never played any shoot them up games, you probably should play some Giga Wing and Raptor Call of the Shadows.

715
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:08,229
Speaker 0: I recommend you start if you're going to play shmups at all.

716
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:11,170
Speaker 0: You should probably play at least Gradius.

717
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:14,330
Speaker 0: Any Gradius, probably Gradius three is probably the easiest.

718
00:44:16,171 --> 00:44:17,629
Speaker 0: Raptor Call of the Shadows of the PC.

719
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:19,385
Speaker 0: It shouldn't be too hard to get that.

720
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:33,189
Speaker 0: Galaga, you probably want to play Space Invaders at least once and also play something like Pocky and Rocky to see how a shmup isn't necessarily ships in outer space shooting a million bullets, but it can also be other things.

721
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:39,969
Speaker 1: Now, of course, to all of our new listeners, if you're looking for the Otacon coverage, stay tuned until tomorrow, because tonight was video games.

722
00:44:40,351 --> 00:44:45,890
Speaker 1: Tomorrow night is anime and manga and comics and anime conventions.

723
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:46,510
Speaker 1: Yes.

724
00:44:46,831 --> 00:44:48,989
Speaker 0: If we went to a gaming convention, we'd be talking about it today.

725
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:49,949
Speaker 1: Yes, we would.

726
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:54,430
Speaker 1: But actually, the next gaming con we're going to, I believe, is UberCon, which I don't even know when it is.

727
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:58,289
Speaker 0: I'm going to start looking for other gaming cons because I really want to go to them.

728
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:07,590
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

729
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:10,170
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

730
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:22,110
Speaker 0: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontroadcrew.com, where you'll find show notes, links, our awesome forum, a link to our Frapper map, and links to all the RSS feeds.

731
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:28,330
Speaker 1: We say feeds plural because Geek Nights airs four nights a week, covering four different brands of geekery.

732
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:30,429
Speaker 1: Mondays are science and technology.

733
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:33,010
Speaker 1: Tuesdays we have video games, board games, and RPGs.

734
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:38,969
Speaker 1: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights, and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

735
00:45:39,431 --> 00:45:47,470
Speaker 0: You can send us feedback by email to geeknights@frontroadcrew.com, or you can send audio feedback via Odeo.

736
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:51,010
Speaker 0: Just click the link that says "send me an Odeo" on the right side of our website.

737
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:56,549

741

Speaker 0: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience, but unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
