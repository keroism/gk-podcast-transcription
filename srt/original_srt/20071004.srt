1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,568
Speaker 0: Hey, it's Thursday October 4th.

2
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:12,451
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,632 --> 00:00:14,838
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek knives.

4
00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:20,259
Speaker 0: tonight I explain what I was doing in Arizona, and why there weren't any shows at the end of last week.

5
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:25,377
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:31,734
Speaker 0: So I got into work yesterday.

7
00:00:31,774 --> 00:00:48,240
Speaker 0: well this morning like I do cuz I skipped work yesterday And I'm sitting in my office going over email getting ready to maybe do some actual work And an email pops up from the person at the front desk and normally I don't need to read an email from the person at the front desk because no one's gonna come and see me in my office.

8
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:53,733
Speaker 0: But the topic of this email intrigued me, and I decided to read it.

9
00:00:54,134 --> 00:00:56,560
Speaker 0: the topic read warning skunk.

10
00:00:59,943 --> 00:01:03,860
Speaker 0: So I open this email and it says not to alarm anyone.

11
00:01:04,161 --> 00:01:10,604
Speaker 0: But a skunk was spotted on the first floor somewhere in the atrium In the building.

12
00:01:10,925 --> 00:01:12,309
Speaker 1: yes, how do you get in?

13
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:15,859
Speaker 0: I'll get to that okay, so I'm thinking huh?

14
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,004
Speaker 0: I wonder how that happened.

15
00:01:18,024 --> 00:01:23,688
Speaker 0: and the email goes on to explain do not attempt to catch or bother the skunk Just stay in your office.

16
00:01:24,029 --> 00:01:26,140
Speaker 0: if you really feel like leaving you're free to leave.

17
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:31,036
Speaker 0: But there's a skunk in the building just so you all know just the animal.

18
00:01:31,076 --> 00:01:32,360
Speaker 1: people come and take it away.

19
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:34,469
Speaker 0: Well, I stayed in my cubicle.

20
00:01:34,891 --> 00:01:35,755
Speaker 1: Did you see the skunk?

21
00:01:35,835 --> 00:01:35,976
Speaker 0: No?

22
00:01:36,016 --> 00:01:36,860
Speaker 0: I didn't see the skunk.

23
00:01:37,201 --> 00:01:40,978
Speaker 1: What kind of you might as well not even told the story what the hell well the thing is.

24
00:01:40,998 --> 00:01:49,455
Speaker 0: I That was not what I expected to happen this morning But yeah about three hours later another email came back saying the skunk has been found.

25
00:01:49,716 --> 00:01:51,060
Speaker 0: animal control has taken it away.

26
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:53,200
Speaker 0: It was rather happy with the cat food.

27
00:01:53,240 --> 00:02:00,591
Speaker 0: We fed it and it is going to be released about 12 miles north of here and hopefully Apparently I didn't know that they had a live trap.

28
00:02:00,631 --> 00:02:01,656
Speaker 0: They fill it with cat food.

29
00:02:01,676 --> 00:02:02,420
Speaker 1: do skunk seat?

30
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:04,858
Speaker 0: You should probably go to what skunk seat.

31
00:02:04,878 --> 00:02:09,512
Speaker 1: calm What do skunks eat?

32
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:10,919
Speaker 0: but apparently cat food.

33
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:23,804
Speaker 0: And yeah, the skunk was found apparently because the building I work in used to be a warehouse you know like turn of the century whatever in this industrial complex and they turned it into offices and This skunk just found a way in.

34
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:29,564
Speaker 0: they found the hole they filled it in and hopefully no more skunks will wander into my office Looking for food.

35
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:33,100
Speaker 1: skunks eat mostly into insects many of which are pests to humans.

36
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,086
Speaker 1: They're therefore beneficial to have around.

37
00:02:35,126 --> 00:02:38,636
Speaker 1: they also eat some plant material including wild fruits apples and corn.

38
00:02:38,997 --> 00:02:42,656
Speaker 1: in winter and spring They eat mice and the eggs of ground nesting birds.

39
00:02:43,058 --> 00:02:43,259
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

40
00:02:44,261 --> 00:02:46,651
Speaker 0: So apparently cat food should be added to that list.

41
00:02:46,812 --> 00:02:48,720
Speaker 1: I think but this isn't Wikipedia so I can't.

42
00:02:49,701 --> 00:02:50,884
Speaker 1: This is please be kind.

43
00:02:51,165 --> 00:02:55,598
Speaker 0: calm skunk daddy as opposed to what badgers eat calm, which I believe is still up.

44
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:56,240
Speaker 1: what?

45
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,629
Speaker 1: You don't know if I got all about that website.

46
00:02:59,649 --> 00:03:00,171
Speaker 1: You did forget.

47
00:03:00,192 --> 00:03:00,854
Speaker 0: It's still there.

48
00:03:01,176 --> 00:03:05,329
Speaker 0: There it is Kind of like zombo.

49
00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:05,650
Speaker 0: It's just.

50
00:03:05,731 --> 00:03:07,259
Speaker 0: I think that's gonna be around forever.

51
00:03:08,508 --> 00:03:11,868
Speaker 1: Yeah It's got a little Simpsons logo at the bottom.

52
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:12,550
Speaker 0: That's good.

53
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:12,992
Speaker 0: That's good.

54
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:13,936
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

55
00:03:13,996 --> 00:03:21,095
Speaker 0: So anyway skunk related news aside We've been talking all week except Tuesday where we keep forgetting.

56
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:22,280
Speaker 1: but oh you remembered us.

57
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,972
Speaker 0: I totally forgot a week from a week from now.

58
00:03:26,213 --> 00:03:30,879
Speaker 0: So probably the week after next we're gonna do it Unless you know your questions all suck, but so far so good.

59
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:35,900
Speaker 0: Instead of just doing a you know question show ask rim and Scott we're doing a questions week.

60
00:03:36,582 --> 00:03:41,120
Speaker 0: So this being Thursday night if you have anything you want to ask us from I don't know.

61
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:46,614
Speaker 0: How do you feel about Barack Obama's ring - why did you get into podcasting?

62
00:03:46,655 --> 00:03:48,620
Speaker 0: go right ahead and ask it and we might just answer.

63
00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:51,327
Speaker 1: Yep, you can answer ask any question.

64
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,935
Speaker 1: It's not a Monday Tuesday or Wednesday question.

65
00:03:53,995 --> 00:03:55,359
Speaker 0: Nothing is out of bounds.

66
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:59,438
Speaker 1: Nope, and we will decide whether we will answer it or not on the show.

67
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:07,039
Speaker 1: and If you want your question to be answered, I recommend you make it a question that could be answered quickly a Question that is not stupid.

68
00:04:07,521 --> 00:04:13,258
Speaker 1: Do not put an essay before after or around your question making it difficult for us to figure out what your question is.

69
00:04:13,358 --> 00:04:20,252
Speaker 0: if your question Can be answered by Google on the first page We might not answer it or we might answer it just to make you look stupid.

70
00:04:20,433 --> 00:04:23,182
Speaker 1: if your question was answered in a previous episode Of geek nights.

71
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:28,580
Speaker 1: the same is also true unless of course the answer has changed which it could very well be possible.

72
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,385
Speaker 0: Yes, very much.

73
00:04:29,526 --> 00:04:31,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, but yeah ask the questions.

74
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,339
Speaker 1: You can send them by email to eat nights if I were crew to come or in the forum.

75
00:04:35,581 --> 00:04:38,130
Speaker 1: We have four different threads one for each question show.

76
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,820
Speaker 1: I think it should sell question to me the appropriate.

77
00:04:41,061 --> 00:04:45,256
Speaker 0: I think it should be self-evident which thread is for which kinds of questions unless you can't read.

78
00:04:45,296 --> 00:04:46,983
Speaker 1: in which case don't ask a question Please.

79
00:04:47,324 --> 00:04:48,169
Speaker 0: I can't read or write.

80
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, please don't ask questions if you can.

81
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:54,493
Speaker 1: The only question you should be asking is how do I learn to read and write?

82
00:04:54,894 --> 00:05:01,819
Speaker 0: All right, so there is kindergarten But anyway, it is a Thursday mean we can talk about whatever we want.

83
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:04,175
Speaker 1: So it's good because there's not much to talk about.

84
00:05:04,215 --> 00:05:07,472
Speaker 0: if anything specific I got a lot of tech news, but I got a hold off on that.

85
00:05:07,713 --> 00:05:09,160
Speaker 1: I don't really have that much tech news.

86
00:05:09,841 --> 00:05:12,932
Speaker 1: Okay, so, you know those guys, you know most dumb people out there.

87
00:05:13,033 --> 00:05:14,980
Speaker 1: now dumb people is a relative term.

88
00:05:15,262 --> 00:05:23,047
Speaker 1: You know, they can't fix their own computer if it breaks, you know If there's an error message and it won't go away and they can't make their computer do what they want it to do They have no clue what to do.

89
00:05:23,068 --> 00:05:25,320
Speaker 0: It's just like if the check engine light comes in my car.

90
00:05:25,483 --> 00:05:26,260
Speaker 0: I don't know what to do.

91
00:05:26,401 --> 00:05:27,326
Speaker 0: All I know is crap.

92
00:05:27,366 --> 00:05:29,960
Speaker 1: got to go to a mechanic or if it doesn't turn your car doesn't start.

93
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:30,662
Speaker 1: What do you do?

94
00:05:30,703 --> 00:05:31,104
Speaker 1: You don't know.

95
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:35,680
Speaker 0: I go to the mechanic and I say ah, my car doesn't start exactly exactly.

96
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:46,858
Speaker 1: So, you know normal people who were not lucky enough to offspring computer professionals or be offspring of computer professionals Or be related to someone who has offsprung computer professionals, etc.

97
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,840
Speaker 1: They really don't have anywhere to turn most of the time and they have to call up.

98
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,320
Speaker 1: You know the geek squad or one of those other ones firedog?

99
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,465
Speaker 0: What were you saying?

100
00:05:56,485 --> 00:05:58,735
Speaker 0: You don't have any tech news nerd something.

101
00:05:58,755 --> 00:06:00,747
Speaker 1: This isn't a news really It's sort of a thing of the day.

102
00:06:00,787 --> 00:06:01,774
Speaker 1: I turned into a news.

103
00:06:01,915 --> 00:06:07,540
Speaker 1: Uh-huh So the CBC the Canadian Broadcasting Company is sort of like the BBC of Canada.

104
00:06:08,461 --> 00:06:18,320
Speaker 1: They did on their news a little expose of all these Computer repair nerdy geeky companies that will come to your house to fix quote fix your computer, huh?

105
00:06:19,143 --> 00:06:21,706
Speaker 0: I Wonder how that turned out.

106
00:06:21,766 --> 00:06:24,919
Speaker 1: so they went to a local college which seemed like an okay college, you know.

107
00:06:25,463 --> 00:06:31,980
Speaker 1: and they said okay break this computer in one way and They broke the computer by putting in one bad stick of RAM.

108
00:06:32,502 --> 00:06:39,303
Speaker 1: Right now you you and me know that if you have a bad stick of RAM the computer when you try to turn it on Might go beep beep beep.

109
00:06:39,784 --> 00:06:40,826
Speaker 1: It also depends.

110
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:50,960
Speaker 1: I might go beep beep beep beep Will give you all some sort of screwed up errors, right?

111
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,420
Speaker 1: So those would be that cuz I'm a computer rational.

112
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:53,842
Speaker 1: I know.

113
00:06:53,922 --> 00:06:57,781
Speaker 1: those would be the symptoms of the only stick of RAM in your computer being bad Yep.

114
00:06:57,821 --> 00:07:01,798
Speaker 0: Now if you have multiple sticks in one's bad, it'll just boot and you won't have enough RAM most likely.

115
00:07:01,818 --> 00:07:07,193
Speaker 1: Yep It'll just be like if you have two 128 meg sticks totaling 256 and one of them is bad.

116
00:07:07,615 --> 00:07:14,800
Speaker 1: your computer will either say 128 when it starts up or it'll work and then it'll crash randomly Which really sucks.

117
00:07:15,462 --> 00:07:24,915
Speaker 1: So they call up ten different places to come and check out this computer in this one apartment All right now before I just want to point out before Scott six, I don't know what the results are.

118
00:07:24,975 --> 00:07:27,923
Speaker 0: But this is Such a trip.

119
00:07:27,943 --> 00:07:28,986
Speaker 0: This isn't a trick question.

120
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:30,731
Speaker 0: This is such a trivial problem.

121
00:07:30,932 --> 00:07:34,122
Speaker 0: any computer professional even a non-professional Take.

122
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,728
Speaker 1: you see I would have had to investigate.

123
00:07:35,748 --> 00:07:38,960
Speaker 1: it would have taken me like 15 minutes of trying different things to figure out.

124
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:40,187
Speaker 1: Is it the motherboard?

125
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:41,274
Speaker 1: is that the RAM stick?

126
00:07:41,334 --> 00:07:42,200
Speaker 1: Is it the video card?

127
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,740
Speaker 0: Maybe but this is not a difficult question.

128
00:07:44,861 --> 00:07:48,500
Speaker 0: It is not a difficult thing to solve given enough time to poke at the computer.

129
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:57,926
Speaker 1: I would have gotten the correct answer a hundred percent of the time and any Standard PC equipment plus the fact that they make it so that there's no Complimentary problems is huge.

130
00:07:58,187 --> 00:07:58,348
Speaker 0: Yep.

131
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:00,296
Speaker 1: There's no other problem, but the RAM stick.

132
00:08:00,477 --> 00:08:03,064
Speaker 1: All right, so They call ten people.

133
00:08:03,084 --> 00:08:07,940
Speaker 1: All right, guess how many of the ten people got it, right all ten?

134
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:09,724
Speaker 0: No, none of them.

135
00:08:09,825 --> 00:08:12,976
Speaker 0: I figured you'd only ask if the number was really high or really low.

136
00:08:13,096 --> 00:08:15,656
Speaker 1: no, it's it's neither It's three.

137
00:08:16,501 --> 00:08:18,531
Speaker 1: Three of them knew it was a bad RAM stick.

138
00:08:18,974 --> 00:08:22,272
Speaker 1: seven of them got it wrong You know, that's kind of better than I expected.

139
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,439
Speaker 0: What did the seven say?

140
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,020
Speaker 1: Because well some of them were just like motherboards dead, you know.

141
00:08:27,261 --> 00:08:32,480
Speaker 1: And obviously that's an easy thing to mistake if you're not well trained and you're not good at the troubleshooting is you know you then?

142
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,390
Speaker 0: Why are you in the computer repair business?

143
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:37,285
Speaker 0: You're just ripping people up Oh Ripping people off.

144
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:39,073
Speaker 1: No, you think that is bad.

145
00:08:39,434 --> 00:08:45,708
Speaker 1: One of the guys was like Yeah hard drives bad you're gonna need to pay like a hundred.

146
00:08:45,748 --> 00:08:46,611
Speaker 1: so, you know, he's like.

147
00:08:46,631 --> 00:08:50,651
Speaker 1: you got to pay me $100 for my time right now and replacement a hard drive.

148
00:08:50,691 --> 00:08:51,599
Speaker 1: hundred forty dollars.

149
00:08:52,603 --> 00:08:59,978
Speaker 0: Wow At my inflated consulting rate the the the ten or fifteen minutes It would take me to solve this.

150
00:09:00,342 --> 00:09:02,659
Speaker 0: Plus the cost of a stick around would be less than that.

151
00:09:02,739 --> 00:09:05,697
Speaker 1: plus It was like an average Dell the stick around would have been like 30 bucks.

152
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,708
Speaker 0: Yeah, if that he probably has one laying around probably.

153
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:15,160
Speaker 1: but yeah, some of the guys say some pretty crazy stuff and Basically what they do is they in the in this video?

154
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,996
Speaker 1: They expose the fact that most of the people doing this job are not computer professionals.

155
00:09:21,016 --> 00:09:26,080
Speaker 0: They have almost no training Whatsoever except that one guy who was obviously just a con man.

156
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:29,659
Speaker 1: Well, some of them were con men and some of them were poorly trained and some you know.

157
00:09:30,442 --> 00:09:41,859
Speaker 1: And I think the problem here is that this job does not pay enough unless you're scamming people to Basically get someone who actually knows that they're doing to do that job.

158
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:56,798
Speaker 0: This is a broader problem that I've run into in my life a lot And I think it's just because IT and computers and all this are kind of new and cars have been around a while The average person if their car breaks they immediately they think crap I'm gonna have to spend a lot of money to get this fixed.

159
00:09:56,818 --> 00:10:01,680
Speaker 0: and Then they go to a mechanic and they say all right mechanic, I don't know what's wrong with my car.

160
00:10:01,821 --> 00:10:07,007
Speaker 0: I'm going to trust you to fix it for me because I know I can't do it myself And you're the only one qualified.

161
00:10:07,669 --> 00:10:12,490
Speaker 0: and while there were a lot of scummy mechanics who ripped people off there's also a lot of mechanics who did the right thing.

162
00:10:12,551 --> 00:10:18,918
Speaker 1: and but the other thing is that it's not like a Mechanic can go and make like more money elsewhere without getting more skills.

163
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:28,948
Speaker 1: true I mean skills required to do this computer repair job are the same skills required to like not do my job But do a similarly paying job.

164
00:10:28,988 --> 00:10:33,829
Speaker 0: You need the equivalent of an associate's degree education to do Basic computer repair.

165
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:34,572
Speaker 0: It's not that.

166
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:41,777
Speaker 1: but with an associate's degree You could work as like, you know a job that pays a lot more money than computer repair guy.

167
00:10:41,797 --> 00:10:44,492
Speaker 0: and for the geeks, dude I'll be honest with an associate's degree.

168
00:10:44,552 --> 00:10:48,260
Speaker 1: You could do my job Yeah, and rims job pays more than geeks.

169
00:10:48,341 --> 00:10:50,420
Speaker 0: My job pays twice as much as geeks.

170
00:10:50,440 --> 00:11:04,530
Speaker 1: The thing is the only people who do this job are say high school and college kids who you know know what they're doing but they can't get a real job yet or People who aren't qualified or people ripping you off Enough money.

171
00:11:04,953 --> 00:11:11,198
Speaker 0: in a lot of places there's regulation as to who can be a mechanic and what they are allowed to offer and also there's just a lot of.

172
00:11:12,227 --> 00:11:20,346
Speaker 0: It seems like people customer side to know a mechanic is going to be expensive and most of the time just find a good mechanic and pay whatever they Ask and expect it to be a lot.

173
00:11:20,386 --> 00:11:29,250
Speaker 0: but a lot of times people who want a computer repaired They they look at what we do and say oh you just looked at it for a second and you know Flip the switch that I could have done that.

174
00:11:29,331 --> 00:11:30,700
Speaker 0: Why should I pay you a hundred bucks?

175
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,567
Speaker 1: Another problem here.

176
00:11:32,668 --> 00:11:34,620
Speaker 1: Is that a car cost say $20,000?

177
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:34,741
Speaker 1: right?

178
00:11:34,802 --> 00:11:42,360
Speaker 1: and Parts of a car, you know, they're big and mechanical and you gotta your hands dirty and it looks like hard work.

179
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:43,631
Speaker 0: And and it is hard work.

180
00:11:43,671 --> 00:11:44,539
Speaker 0: We're not pretending it is.

181
00:11:45,363 --> 00:12:03,840
Speaker 1: But you know paying $800 to fix a $20,000 car makes sense Right, and you know whether that $800 is the the rare skilled knowledge of the laborer or the parts doesn't really matter to you Because the price compared to the price of the whole thing that you're fixing makes sense for a computer, right?

182
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:13,060
Speaker 1: $1,000 computer, you know, you might need a $50 repair like a ramstick But the price of the labor of the person makes it seem stupid.

183
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,175
Speaker 1: You're gonna have to if you want me to come to your house spend the time to figure it out.

184
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:22,613
Speaker 1: deal with you Get the ramstick you install it give it back.

185
00:12:22,774 --> 00:12:24,140
Speaker 0: you notice Scott pies at that.

186
00:12:24,842 --> 00:12:27,674
Speaker 0: There are a lot of tech jobs out there that both of us could do.

187
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:29,528
Speaker 0: that would pay quite a bit of money that sort of thing.

188
00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:33,895
Speaker 0: but Honestly dealing with a lot of people is just not worth any amount of money.

189
00:12:34,096 --> 00:12:44,927
Speaker 1: and when you add it up It doesn't make sense for the people getting their computer repaired to have me do it because the cost to have me do it versus untrained guy Makes it no law.

190
00:12:44,947 --> 00:12:50,960
Speaker 1: you're better off buying a new computer than getting me to fix it But then untrained guy might not be trained.

191
00:12:51,321 --> 00:13:02,420
Speaker 1: that's why the only way to get your computer fixed if you don't know what you're doing is either a learn something or Be find me in high school or college while it's still worth it to pay me to do it.

192
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:08,520
Speaker 0: Well, I think one big difference and I think this will be good in the long run Is that to be a mechanic to fix problems with cars?

193
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:16,180
Speaker 0: You need a lot of very expensive tools a lot of equipment a lot of like physical knowledge in addition to technical knowledge.

194
00:13:16,582 --> 00:13:19,535
Speaker 0: So it's out of the realm for the average person to fix their car.

195
00:13:19,555 --> 00:13:22,399
Speaker 1: not just physical knowledge But like tools like you need a lift.

196
00:13:22,922 --> 00:13:29,409
Speaker 1: It's like sure I might read all these books on mechanics and everything about it and buy a tool set at Home Depot But I don't have a lift.

197
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,125
Speaker 1: that guy has a lift, you know No one can.

198
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,199
Speaker 1: it's not like everyone can afford to buy a lift.

199
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,134
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know one guy buys a lift and everyone uses his.

200
00:13:37,154 --> 00:13:42,040
Speaker 1: but he made money It doesn't you really everyone can own a Phillips screwdriver.

201
00:13:42,342 --> 00:13:43,327
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't need much.

202
00:13:43,428 --> 00:13:52,420
Speaker 0: at most if you really want to repair computers You need one working computer from which you can take known working parts and stick them in possibly not working computers.

203
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:59,480
Speaker 1: You also need a Phillips screwdriver Possibly a flathead a little one to pop off heatsink and an internet connection with that working computer.

204
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,071
Speaker 1: So you can go to new egg calm or possibly Google.

205
00:14:02,413 --> 00:14:03,497
Speaker 1: mostly new egg calm.

206
00:14:03,698 --> 00:14:05,162
Speaker 0: Yeah I don't know.

207
00:14:05,202 --> 00:14:08,553
Speaker 0: It's a complicated thing is like I was kind of hitting that.

208
00:14:08,653 --> 00:14:18,373
Speaker 0: I think the root issue is that people I By and large don't understand how Complicated computers are and as a result, they don't like like.

209
00:14:18,393 --> 00:14:20,600
Speaker 0: they look at what we do and they think wow, that was easy.

210
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,853
Speaker 0: Why do I pay you when in fact it's not quite so easy.

211
00:14:23,873 --> 00:14:24,496
Speaker 1: It's so easy.

212
00:14:24,536 --> 00:14:25,400
Speaker 1: Why'd you call me?

213
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:33,860
Speaker 0: Yeah But they're more willing to pay for other things like cars or you know house repair because the car means a lot more to them Than their computer and the car cost a lot more.

214
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,080
Speaker 0: But the computer does mean a lot to them because they really need those pictures and they really care about it.

215
00:14:38,401 --> 00:14:44,789
Speaker 0: It's it's kind of like people want something and they really want it and it's important to them But they're not willing to pay what it costs.

216
00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:46,777
Speaker 1: So it doesn't mean that much to them.

217
00:14:46,817 --> 00:14:47,580
Speaker 1: It means less than that.

218
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,799
Speaker 0: Well that that's the problem.

219
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:50,186
Speaker 0: It means just as much.

220
00:14:50,627 --> 00:14:59,359
Speaker 0: but they decide they're not willing to pay and as a result That's a market where there's no money to be made by skilled people And it's not even worth it.

221
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,940
Speaker 1: You know, even if people were willing to pay the amount they're willing to pay could buy them a new computer.

222
00:15:04,262 --> 00:15:07,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, the amount that they were required me to get to do the job.

223
00:15:07,381 --> 00:15:12,057
Speaker 0: I think there could be a happy medium where the prices could be reasonable and yet people get a good help.

224
00:15:12,098 --> 00:15:17,471
Speaker 1: what it will take Is an increased number of people with these skills to repair the computers.

225
00:15:17,852 --> 00:15:20,439
Speaker 1: thus the the price that we can get.

226
00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:26,180
Speaker 1: like You know, that would be like the job you could get and you couldn't really make any more money without getting more skills.

227
00:15:26,321 --> 00:15:33,080
Speaker 0: I think another problem is just that computers Despite people don't realize that they take as much if not more maintenance than a car.

228
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,964
Speaker 0: I mean people.

229
00:15:34,024 --> 00:15:35,109
Speaker 0: when they have a car they know.

230
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,540
Speaker 0: All right, I got to get an oil change every X.

231
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,089
Speaker 1: I gotta rotate my tires.

232
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:40,357
Speaker 0: I gotta buy new tires period.

233
00:15:40,377 --> 00:15:44,060
Speaker 1: sometimes They maintain them more than they have to because someone scams them into doing it.

234
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,380
Speaker 1: Like you got a valve lean like hey, you want to replace that filter?

235
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,119
Speaker 1: You only had to replace 40,000 miles even though you've only had it for a thousand miles.

236
00:15:50,653 --> 00:15:52,239
Speaker 1: But yeah You want to replace that filter 40 bucks?

237
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,006
Speaker 0: People expect that they have to do maintenance on a come on a car and if they don't know how to do it themselves They expect to pay someone else.

238
00:15:58,066 --> 00:15:59,714
Speaker 0: not a lot of money, but they got to pay something.

239
00:16:00,357 --> 00:16:03,951
Speaker 0: with computers Most people don't realize there's maintenance involved.

240
00:16:03,971 --> 00:16:06,500
Speaker 0: they buy a computer and they just assume it'll last forever.

241
00:16:06,681 --> 00:16:10,057
Speaker 1: It's like they don't do maintenance on their DVD players or their stereos.

242
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:16,280
Speaker 0: or you know They're televisions DVD players and stereos and televisions last a lot longer if you do do periodic maintenance.

243
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,286
Speaker 1: They do but they don't.

244
00:16:17,386 --> 00:16:19,700
Speaker 1: they're not expected to have to do maintenance on those things.

245
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,435
Speaker 1: And in fact many of those things will say don't maintain me.

246
00:16:22,495 --> 00:16:32,360
Speaker 1: Don't open me up You know, whereas with a computer and like a personal computer, it's not a Mac I guess you have to do maintenance and no one knows how or is told to do so or anything.

247
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:38,880
Speaker 0: See if people knew that maintenance had to be done if that was part of the these computer repair guys be out of a job.

248
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,132
Speaker 1: well

249
00:16:39,242 --> 00:16:55,495
Speaker 0: No if it just if there were a global consciousness among people who had computers that there was some sort of maintenance that had to be done periodically That periodic maintenance can be done by much less skilled people for much less money than Actually fixing the problem that comes from a lack of maintenance.

250
00:16:55,937 --> 00:16:56,399
Speaker 1: That is true.

251
00:16:57,102 --> 00:17:07,260
Speaker 0: And if we could just convince people that computers are not these you just boxes like DVD players and that they're not Simple and you can use one and you cannot know a lot about it.

252
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,372
Speaker 0: But you have to be willing to pay someone if you're not willing to learn it's one of the two.

253
00:17:10,714 --> 00:17:12,260
Speaker 0: learn something pay someone.

254
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:17,420
Speaker 0: If you're not willing to do either your computer is always going to crap out on you and there's nothing you can do about.

255
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,160
Speaker 1: but Don't get ripped off by one of these guys.

256
00:17:19,361 --> 00:17:21,711
Speaker 0: Yeah, but who you how you gonna know?

257
00:17:21,752 --> 00:17:23,459
Speaker 0: if you're gonna get ripped off because you don't know anything?

258
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:25,420
Speaker 1: Ask us right.

259
00:17:25,922 --> 00:17:33,653
Speaker 0: So I'm not gonna talk about this much but our friend James Randi the most crotchety man in the world Has the James Randi challenge.

260
00:17:33,673 --> 00:17:42,307
Speaker 0: we talked about this a while ago but he's kind of switched it up and he's ignoring the batshit crazy people because there's Nothing to be gained by slamming those.

261
00:17:42,348 --> 00:17:45,080
Speaker 1: but he's paying attention to the batshit crazy people for how many years?

262
00:17:45,741 --> 00:17:47,640
Speaker 1: And he's just fed up with it and they're a waste of his time.

263
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,484
Speaker 1: You know people come up.

264
00:17:48,504 --> 00:17:49,991
Speaker 1: they're like I can douse.

265
00:17:50,272 --> 00:17:55,848
Speaker 1: watch me douse and he's like, okay I'll watch you douse like I said, I would Okay, you didn't douse.

266
00:17:55,888 --> 00:17:58,620
Speaker 1: now that I actually looked at it go away you nut job.

267
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:01,710
Speaker 1: But but the the spirits were not an alignment.

268
00:18:01,911 --> 00:18:06,120
Speaker 0: like your pocket watch is interfering with fine I'll put my pocket watch at home.

269
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,830
Speaker 0: when will the spirits be in alignment and then the test still fails.

270
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,159
Speaker 0: and but nothing good was coming out of that.

271
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:24,700
Speaker 0: because basically, he was finding people and One by one at significant cost was either getting them to realize wow Maybe I can't douse or just making up excuses, but it wasn't changing the world in any meaningful way.

272
00:18:25,402 --> 00:18:31,959
Speaker 0: so he decided now to only go after people where they have something to lose where the public and the press would care.

273
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:47,779
Speaker 0: and one of these groups of people are the golden ear audiophiles the people who spend $10,000 on a wooden knob to stick on top of their volume knob to make the Resonance of the crystal a quantum matrix sound better and thus make the music more playful to the ear.

274
00:18:48,742 --> 00:18:54,400
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, or you know the $40,000 speaker cables that are actually just whatever gauge wire.

275
00:18:54,802 --> 00:19:02,660
Speaker 1: Yep, but it's hand-wound in Indonesia So why wouldn't it be better if it's hand-wound in like Malaysia?

276
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:03,583
Speaker 0: I don't know.

277
00:19:04,045 --> 00:19:15,435
Speaker 1: all I know is that these people are idiots and they're all over the internet And there's a famous quote that's like you know people who are into music You know they listen to songs and audiophiles listen to stereos.

278
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:25,896
Speaker 0: Oh so true Yeah, but the funny thing is anytime someone does a test of this audiophile crap it turns out that No, human being has ever been able to hear the difference.

279
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:26,500
Speaker 0: ever.

280
00:19:26,982 --> 00:19:27,827
Speaker 0: I remember ever.

281
00:19:28,149 --> 00:19:32,189
Speaker 1: I learned this lesson early on cuz when I was a kid I was watching PBS and there was some show.

282
00:19:32,209 --> 00:19:33,816
Speaker 1: I forget what the hell it was called.

283
00:19:34,057 --> 00:19:34,600
Speaker 0: was it Nova?

284
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:37,805
Speaker 1: No, it was started with a Z I think but he was they.

285
00:19:37,825 --> 00:19:44,466
Speaker 1: basically it was when CDs were really new right and he was actually like a choice like CDs or cassettes, I don't know right.

286
00:19:44,908 --> 00:19:45,911
Speaker 0: see I know right away.

287
00:19:46,212 --> 00:19:48,619
Speaker 0: the answer was cassettes because I knew a lot about her CDs.

288
00:19:48,982 --> 00:19:49,819
Speaker 0: Why did I say cassettes?

289
00:19:50,361 --> 00:19:56,700
Speaker 0: Yep, cuz I'd learn I knew a lot about how cassettes worked and I knew that it was really shitty and making cassettes sucked.

290
00:19:57,282 --> 00:20:00,331
Speaker 0: Yeah, once I knew what bias was and why I had to use it.

291
00:20:00,551 --> 00:20:03,400
Speaker 1: Ah, but anyway, but anyway, of course CDs are better.

292
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:12,400
Speaker 1: However, what they did is they did a test of all these kids and they had the kids come in blindfold And they had four boom boxes and two of them had cassettes and two of them had CDs, right?

293
00:20:13,522 --> 00:20:15,020
Speaker 1: They actually did like CDs.

294
00:20:15,222 --> 00:20:28,367
Speaker 1: I think they're all CD slash cassette boom boxes right and they had four of them and the kids would come in and they try to you know say which was better and which Was worse and in the end They what cassette or a CD didn't matter.

295
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,834
Speaker 1: all that mattered was which boom box it was.

296
00:20:31,175 --> 00:20:39,480
Speaker 1: and the boom box that looked the shittiest Actually was the best and it was because it had better speakers that were wooden and it didn't look as fancy as the other ones.

297
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:45,140
Speaker 1: But apparently it got more that sounds betters than the other ones did and it didn't matter if it was CD or cassette.

298
00:20:45,482 --> 00:20:48,558
Speaker 1: it sounded the cassettes and that one sounded better than CDs and the other one.

299
00:20:48,578 --> 00:20:50,602
Speaker 1: and Then I learned huh?

300
00:20:51,485 --> 00:20:55,397
Speaker 1: A lot of people are gonna trick you into thinking things sound better when they don't yep.

301
00:20:55,557 --> 00:21:10,180
Speaker 0: and taken to the extreme Now people will buy $40,000 speakers that don't sound better than $50 speakers and other people will make $40,000 without having to work, you know how many times Scott and I have been tempted to just be con men.

302
00:21:10,635 --> 00:21:12,660
Speaker 1: Yeah I don't start the audiophile business.

303
00:21:12,902 --> 00:21:23,454
Speaker 1: It would be I could go to Radio Shack Then write a story put the story on a piece of paper in a box with the shit I bought at Radio Shack resell mark up the price times a thousand.

304
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:24,740
Speaker 0: it would be so easy.

305
00:21:25,147 --> 00:21:30,740
Speaker 0: But yeah James Randi is going after these people and pretty much saying he's going after a bunch of specific ones.

306
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:41,920
Speaker 0: if in any double-blind test you can find any Statistically significant correlation between any of your products and a preference from listeners will give you a million dollars.

307
00:21:42,221 --> 00:21:44,874
Speaker 0: Yep, and funny how they're not taking him up on it.

308
00:21:45,236 --> 00:21:46,000
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, it's real fun.

309
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,547
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, is there any?

310
00:21:47,688 --> 00:21:50,180
Speaker 1: he's basically saying if you can prove this difference easy?

311
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:57,580
Speaker 0: He's targeting a specific cable maker saying if your cables are actually better We'll give you a million dollars because you're so awesome.

312
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:05,500
Speaker 1: He's even like he's comparing them against monster cables, which are still a ripoff, you know I say go all the way compare them against like lamp cord.

313
00:22:06,082 --> 00:22:08,751
Speaker 0: Lamp cord is some of the best speaker cable you're gonna find.

314
00:22:08,831 --> 00:22:09,173
Speaker 0: it is.

315
00:22:09,213 --> 00:22:11,340
Speaker 1: that's why I'm saying, you know, really insult them.

316
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,471
Speaker 1: He's basically saying yeah try to beat monster cable.

317
00:22:13,491 --> 00:22:15,802
Speaker 1: He should say try to beat lamp cord Cuz.

318
00:22:15,863 --> 00:22:17,209
Speaker 1: I had lamp cord is really good.

319
00:22:18,073 --> 00:22:18,917
Speaker 1: I should get some from Home Depot.

320
00:22:20,403 --> 00:22:29,906
Speaker 1: It's cheaper than anything at Radio Shack Things of the day.

321
00:22:30,367 --> 00:22:31,934
Speaker 0: So this might be a little old.

322
00:22:31,974 --> 00:22:33,320
Speaker 0: I've seen videos like this before.

323
00:22:33,722 --> 00:22:37,060
Speaker 0: People at RIT did something similar but nearly not as awesome.

324
00:22:37,262 --> 00:22:43,640
Speaker 0: I have seen many similar pranks in my day But this one is just so well done and also it uses one of my favorite disco songs.

325
00:22:44,001 --> 00:22:45,948
Speaker 1: It is the perfect execution of the idea.

326
00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:48,657
Speaker 0: In fact, I think it's the best execution I've ever seen.

327
00:22:48,677 --> 00:22:49,520
Speaker 0: I agree.

328
00:22:49,841 --> 00:22:52,252
Speaker 0: So imagine if you're just you know, you're bored in college.

329
00:22:52,292 --> 00:22:52,895
Speaker 0: What are you gonna do?

330
00:22:53,075 --> 00:22:56,110
Speaker 0: Obviously pull a prank So you get two of your friends.

331
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:14,260
Speaker 0: you got three people get to an elevator Boombox playing born to be alive not the Hitler remix or the original born to be alive And disco ball and some lights And you dress up in polyester and you have a disco party in that elevator all day.

332
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:17,840
Speaker 1: I love doing shit in elevators like that, but only first got to RIT.

333
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:31,285
Speaker 0: I remember I went to visit in another building and the elevator opens and there's just a guy sitting in a lawn chair in the And he says hey and I say hey and I get in and he says so how you like an RIT so far And I'm like, it's okay.

334
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:33,654
Speaker 0: I met some weird guy sitting in an elevator.

335
00:23:33,694 --> 00:23:35,200
Speaker 0: He's like, yeah, they'll do that.

336
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:41,044
Speaker 0: Then I got off on the third floor and it was just Good time.

337
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:42,170
Speaker 0: I love that kind of prank.

338
00:23:42,391 --> 00:23:44,080
Speaker 0: This video is so worth watching.

339
00:23:44,404 --> 00:23:48,209
Speaker 1: I missed the days when I would see Unexpected things like that in my life on a daily basis.

340
00:23:48,229 --> 00:23:48,470
Speaker 1: remember

341
00:23:48,510 --> 00:24:01,340
Speaker 0: when we came home that one day and there's just a burning couch outside of our apartment And I remember all I thought was I hope that's the only one and we just walked past it and went in and then an Hour later we came out and it finished burning.

342
00:24:01,681 --> 00:24:06,157
Speaker 0: There was the campus safety guy looking at it obviously thinking wonder who set this on fire?

343
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:07,000
Speaker 1: good times.

344
00:24:08,901 --> 00:24:12,216
Speaker 0: Or that crazy guy who wore a Viking hat for what like a year and a half.

345
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,160
Speaker 1: I know that guy.

346
00:24:13,381 --> 00:24:14,245
Speaker 0: I know that guy too.

347
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:15,773
Speaker 1: I think you might know him.

348
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:16,980
Speaker 1: You may know him very well.

349
00:24:18,482 --> 00:24:21,055
Speaker 0: So, what do you got for me speaking of the college times?

350
00:24:21,498 --> 00:24:24,205
Speaker 1: Oh boy You know people in college.

351
00:24:24,226 --> 00:24:24,928
Speaker 1: They're pretty bored.

352
00:24:24,989 --> 00:24:32,964
Speaker 1: No think of things to do, you know, they'll play some hacky sack They'll play some kickball some quarters 140 bucks playing quarters.

353
00:24:33,406 --> 00:24:35,591
Speaker 1: All right, they'll play some frisbee.

354
00:24:35,611 --> 00:24:37,336
Speaker 0: All right ultimate frisbee.

355
00:24:37,456 --> 00:24:37,676
Speaker 1: Yep.

356
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:42,576
Speaker 1: What if they Get really bored and they're inside with the frisbee.

357
00:24:42,597 --> 00:24:43,240
Speaker 1: What do you do then?

358
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,024
Speaker 1: Well, this is what you do.

359
00:24:45,064 --> 00:24:48,614
Speaker 1: You play a game that these people call GlaxoSmithKline.

360
00:24:48,674 --> 00:24:50,339
Speaker 1: No relation to the pharmaceutical company.

361
00:24:52,663 --> 00:24:55,592
Speaker 1: The way the game works is step one you get a table.

362
00:24:56,314 --> 00:24:59,727
Speaker 1: step two you get a frisbee Hopefully good frisbee.

363
00:25:00,189 --> 00:25:02,279
Speaker 1: step three you get some grease.

364
00:25:02,943 --> 00:25:04,051
Speaker 0: Grease me up woman.

365
00:25:04,554 --> 00:25:07,335
Speaker 1: step four Grease the table.

366
00:25:07,355 --> 00:25:13,620
Speaker 1: Oh Step five spin frisbee sideways on table.

367
00:25:15,142 --> 00:25:20,900
Speaker 1: Get four people around the table and much like hacky sack Keep that frisbee spinning.

368
00:25:22,302 --> 00:25:24,149
Speaker 1: And you watch this video these people doing this.

369
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:28,885
Speaker 1: and I'm like, hey, that's good times right there You know, there's something about.

370
00:25:28,925 --> 00:25:31,212
Speaker 1: they even document all the different techniques.

371
00:25:31,273 --> 00:25:31,995
Speaker 1: They come on.

372
00:25:32,256 --> 00:25:51,554
Speaker 0: That's that's exactly what I was gonna About that college thing where you're so bored that you'll come up you and your friends with a new sport Whatever it may be and then you'll proceed to play that sport obsessively until you are Probably the best four people in the world at that sport.

373
00:25:51,595 --> 00:26:00,200
Speaker 0: I think they're the only four people in the world Exactly, and at that point you have all the strategies all that you have names for the different possible moves.

374
00:26:00,421 --> 00:26:02,811
Speaker 1: Like yeah, where do you think like, you know skateboarders?

375
00:26:02,851 --> 00:26:05,120
Speaker 1: They call things like yeah, you're doing the reverse.

376
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,986
Speaker 1: I'll leave Ali something in the 720 handstand.

377
00:26:09,066 --> 00:26:13,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, or like, you know what figure skating the back the Lutz something and the something else.

378
00:26:13,261 --> 00:26:18,344
Speaker 1: Where do you think those names came from the first guy to do it was like, oh look at this I'm gonna do the.

379
00:26:18,525 --> 00:26:21,520
Speaker 1: he does something you're like, I call it the something chess is the same way.

380
00:26:21,801 --> 00:26:28,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got the Polish opening my favorite opening even though I've never fucking won with it ever, but I think it's I like it Yep.

381
00:26:28,741 --> 00:26:34,619
Speaker 1: so this one they've got like the wall and like the slide and the hop and the whatever.

382
00:26:34,639 --> 00:26:37,266
Speaker 1: and These guys they got the right idea.

383
00:26:37,327 --> 00:26:40,659
Speaker 0: There's just something to be said for making up a sport and then being really good at it.

384
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,946
Speaker 0: Yep, almost like air hockey.

385
00:26:42,966 --> 00:26:43,789
Speaker 1: I've got a table.

386
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:45,775
Speaker 1: You don't mind getting greasy and a frisbee.

387
00:26:46,136 --> 00:26:47,159
Speaker 0: They get the grease off.

388
00:26:48,942 --> 00:26:50,650
Speaker 0: Towel grease doesn't come off so easy.

389
00:26:51,133 --> 00:26:52,178
Speaker 1: towel grease remover.

390
00:26:53,062 --> 00:26:56,314
Speaker 0: I imagine that table never recovered and they probably are gonna throw it away.

391
00:26:56,334 --> 00:26:57,760
Speaker 1: pretty shitty table looking at it.

392
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,712
Speaker 1: Well, I think what they should have done is they should have had a square table.

393
00:27:00,732 --> 00:27:04,280
Speaker 1: the square the table sort of rectangular with a square table.

394
00:27:04,761 --> 00:27:10,079
Speaker 1: then all the players would be sort of equal and also they could sort of change the sport into instead of.

395
00:27:10,621 --> 00:27:13,179
Speaker 1: How long could the four of us keep this up to?

396
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,584
Speaker 1: Knock it off the other guy's side.

397
00:27:15,684 --> 00:27:16,045
Speaker 1: Huh?

398
00:27:16,146 --> 00:27:17,069
Speaker 1: Sort of like warlords.

399
00:27:17,851 --> 00:27:18,313
Speaker 0: Oh, man.

400
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:19,155
Speaker 0: That's a good reference.

401
00:27:19,436 --> 00:27:19,657
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

402
00:27:19,717 --> 00:27:20,680
Speaker 0: We got to review that game.

403
00:27:20,881 --> 00:27:22,287
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a damn good game.

404
00:27:22,488 --> 00:27:23,211
Speaker 1: warlords is a good.

405
00:27:23,231 --> 00:27:27,042
Speaker 1: game needs to be brought back 3d warlords Right.

406
00:27:27,082 --> 00:27:31,899
Speaker 0: So the show might be a little different from usual shows because it's mostly gonna be me talking and Scott going.

407
00:27:31,979 --> 00:27:32,120
Speaker 0: what?

408
00:27:32,762 --> 00:27:33,477
Speaker 0: Wow, huh?

409
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,078
Speaker 1: Or why you're stupid?

410
00:27:35,481 --> 00:27:40,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, well because you might have noticed that there was no show last Thursday and last Wednesday was a cop-out.

411
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,205
Speaker 0: That's because for various reasons.

412
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:49,891
Speaker 0: I was in Arizona from Wednesday night until you know Not too long ago in the desert in the desert.

413
00:27:49,911 --> 00:27:54,806
Speaker 0: Oh, I have never been west of Chicago in my life Until I flew to Arizona.

414
00:27:54,826 --> 00:28:03,056
Speaker 1: I haven't been west of Novi, Michigan unless you count Israel is West But I went east to get there so I don't count that.

415
00:28:03,378 --> 00:28:04,344
Speaker 0: wow Yeah, that's right.

416
00:28:04,364 --> 00:28:07,720
Speaker 0: when we drove out to Novi that crazy land were at 4 in the morning.

417
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:12,440
Speaker 0: You were staring out at the freeway from the window and bitching about how many cars and where the fuck are those people going at?

418
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,065
Speaker 0: 4 in the morning.

419
00:28:13,126 --> 00:28:14,136
Speaker 0: Why are there so many of them?

420
00:28:15,663 --> 00:28:17,080
Speaker 0: But that's it was a good time.

421
00:28:17,221 --> 00:28:24,978
Speaker 0: I think we've talked about that trip enough But I was in Arizona and I think I'm just gonna kind of chronologically talk about my trip because I noticed a lot of interesting things.

422
00:28:25,683 --> 00:28:37,100
Speaker 0: So first off I'd like to say this is the first time in my life Since high school when I flew to Florida to March in the Citrus Bowl that I flew in a plane without incident.

423
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,124
Speaker 0: Nothing bad happened.

424
00:28:39,345 --> 00:28:40,688
Speaker 0: My flight wasn't delayed.

425
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,253
Speaker 0: Nothing weird happened.

426
00:28:42,674 --> 00:28:44,640
Speaker 0: I got four bags of animal crackers.

427
00:28:44,741 --> 00:28:45,840
Speaker 0: I coconut tonic water.

428
00:28:46,245 --> 00:28:47,197
Speaker 1: You know why that was?

429
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,704
Speaker 0: Cuz I flew jet blue.

430
00:28:48,724 --> 00:28:52,540
Speaker 1: cuz you listen to me and you flew the jet blue instead of flying whatever crap you're flying before.

431
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:57,303
Speaker 0: Well, the reason I flew whatever crap I was flying before is cuz jet blue didn't fly at all the places I was trying to fly.

432
00:28:57,344 --> 00:28:58,428
Speaker 1: They're a domestic airline.

433
00:28:58,448 --> 00:29:01,420
Speaker 1: They only fly where it's profitable, which is what you wanted, right?

434
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,680
Speaker 1: You know, you didn't want the airlines to fly where it's not profitable.

435
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,780
Speaker 0: It's both cheaper and easier to fly to Tucson, Arizona or Phoenix, Arizona.

436
00:29:09,303 --> 00:29:12,379
Speaker 0: Then it is to fly to Detroit, which is much closer.

437
00:29:12,841 --> 00:29:17,720
Speaker 1: Yep, you know jet blue started out as we're gonna have all the same planes.

438
00:29:18,061 --> 00:29:23,660
Speaker 1: We're gonna have flights to get out on time where they've actually got two kinds of planes now with less weight.

439
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,403
Speaker 1: That was originally.

440
00:29:24,443 --> 00:29:28,760
Speaker 0: though they less waiting thing is they only have two kinds of planes and the planes are very similar.

441
00:29:28,861 --> 00:29:33,759
Speaker 1: Yep, and they're gonna you know Not give you the crap food on the plane because you don't want it.

442
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,247
Speaker 1: Anyway, and it would cost too much to give you food.

443
00:29:36,287 --> 00:29:37,350
Speaker 1: You actually want instead.

444
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:40,198
Speaker 1: I got animal crackers and water or cashews.

445
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:45,520
Speaker 1: Yep, and You know, we're gonna give you a TV in every seat and there's no first class.

446
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,274
Speaker 1: It's just coach all the way through this one class and it's pretty nice class.

447
00:29:50,354 --> 00:29:51,337
Speaker 1: It's not quite coach.

448
00:29:51,377 --> 00:29:52,320
Speaker 1: It's not quite first class.

449
00:29:52,401 --> 00:29:57,094
Speaker 1: it's normal class and They started expanding and it totally worked.

450
00:29:57,195 --> 00:30:11,040
Speaker 1: and while nowadays They're still not as cheap as they used to be because of rising fuel costs and whatnot as a whole Jet blue in my experience is still a more a less stressful flying experience than any other domestic airline.

451
00:30:11,582 --> 00:30:18,453
Speaker 0: And pretty much I just got to say if you ever drive to JFK Unless except in very specific surface.

452
00:30:18,473 --> 00:30:28,706
Speaker 0: So parking's a lot of money You're probably stupid because it not only is it cheaper faster easier and nicer to take air train to wherever you're going But it's just better.

453
00:30:29,007 --> 00:30:30,956
Speaker 0: There's no reason to drive to JFK.

454
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:31,820
Speaker 0: Well, you know luggage.

455
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,808
Speaker 1: Well, like my dad would drive me there.

456
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,777
Speaker 1: Let me off and then go away.

457
00:30:35,797 --> 00:30:40,560
Speaker 0: That's okay Yeah, but if you don't want to park there, so I just took Metro North to Grand Central.

458
00:30:40,923 --> 00:30:42,800
Speaker 0: Then I took the sixth train up to 51st Street.

459
00:30:43,102 --> 00:30:45,220
Speaker 0: I took the E train all the way across to Jamaica.

460
00:30:45,662 --> 00:30:54,093
Speaker 0: Then I got off there got right on air train took me right to my terminal got off check my bags Right there and then I had a really crappy burrito in the terminal.

461
00:30:54,775 --> 00:30:56,280
Speaker 1: Ah, you don't eat that food in the terminal.

462
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:01,880
Speaker 1: I was hungry this one place in the jet blue terminal there where you can get like mad french toast for breakfast.

463
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:02,445
Speaker 1: But that's it.

464
00:31:02,465 --> 00:31:03,413
Speaker 1: You don't want to eat in the terminal.

465
00:31:03,434 --> 00:31:09,420
Speaker 0: Otherwise, yeah Well, there was a sushi place and I really wanted it, but it was way too expensive and I imagined it wasn't that good.

466
00:31:09,585 --> 00:31:15,365
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah They do have that really big convenience store there that sells like half touristy crap But also half useful stuff.

467
00:31:15,385 --> 00:31:19,945
Speaker 0: I bought a naked juice there and I bought some cookies for the plane Usually buy gum there.

468
00:31:20,327 --> 00:31:26,063
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'm glad I didn't eat at the sushi place cuz when I got off in Tucson Three hours later.

469
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:28,430
Speaker 0: I can't believe how fast we flew to Arizona.

470
00:31:28,991 --> 00:31:29,934
Speaker 0: even the pilot got on.

471
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:32,200
Speaker 0: He's like, yeah, there was a tailwind.

472
00:31:32,301 --> 00:31:33,974
Speaker 0: We're here stupidly early.

473
00:31:34,014 --> 00:31:34,599
Speaker 0: Just so you know.

474
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:39,240
Speaker 0: But the exact same sushi place was in the terminal and Tucson.

475
00:31:39,722 --> 00:31:42,654
Speaker 1: That's how those things go like when you go to the rest stops on the highway.

476
00:31:42,714 --> 00:31:43,940
Speaker 1: They all have the same places.

477
00:31:44,522 --> 00:31:49,244
Speaker 1: Yep places you don't see in normal places cuz although I Would eat at them.

478
00:31:49,405 --> 00:31:55,867
Speaker 0: so I got picked up at the airport and one thing I'd like to notice is it was a lot Fucking hotter in Yonkers than it was in Arizona.

479
00:31:55,907 --> 00:31:56,589
Speaker 0: God damn.

480
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:57,912
Speaker 1: Well, maybe did it.

481
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:00,600
Speaker 1: was it actually temperature wise hotter or would just feel hotter?

482
00:32:00,781 --> 00:32:01,524
Speaker 0: Well, it was both cuz.

483
00:32:01,685 --> 00:32:04,920
Speaker 0: one it was like a 10 or 11 when I got to Arizona.

484
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,910
Speaker 0: So it was cooled off to like 75 80 degrees.

485
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:10,740
Speaker 0: that makes sense, but it was like 90 and Yonkers.

486
00:32:11,082 --> 00:32:14,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, people always tell you, you know, like oh the desert is really cold at night.

487
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:21,400
Speaker 1: Well, maybe but I was in the desert in Israel, which is a real desert and at night it was still warm.

488
00:32:21,641 --> 00:32:23,328
Speaker 0: It depends on what part of the desert and when.

489
00:32:23,348 --> 00:32:29,446
Speaker 0: but I got to say even during the day when it was, you know 90-95 degrees whatever It was really nice.

490
00:32:29,466 --> 00:32:32,280
Speaker 0: I was never uncomfortably hot the entire time there.

491
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:38,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean in Israel again because my only desert experience I walked through the desert for the whole day.

492
00:32:38,985 --> 00:32:40,160
Speaker 0: You can't walk through ten deserts.

493
00:32:40,361 --> 00:32:45,020
Speaker 1: I walked through the desert the whole for like an entire day and then part of another entire day.

494
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,407
Speaker 1: I think maybe even two and a half days.

495
00:32:46,447 --> 00:32:49,923
Speaker 0: I don't remember, you know people always say it's not the heat It's you that's the humidity.

496
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:51,488
Speaker 0: That's a hundred percent true.

497
00:32:51,508 --> 00:32:55,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, I never got like tired like I was gonna fall over.

498
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:55,702
Speaker 1: Well, that's cuz.

499
00:32:55,722 --> 00:32:56,525
Speaker 1: I was drinking water.

500
00:32:56,585 --> 00:33:00,320
Speaker 1: But regardless of that, you know that feeling of like, you know water.

501
00:33:00,681 --> 00:33:05,114
Speaker 1: Well, you know the the stereotypical cartoon guy in the desert that's all parched.

502
00:33:05,555 --> 00:33:07,260
Speaker 1: You never felt bad walk in the desert.

503
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:12,980
Speaker 1: I was just walking and Drinking water and walking and the water was warm and it didn't feel good to drink it.

504
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,569
Speaker 1: But I just kept walking.

505
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,500
Speaker 1: I didn't feel tired at any time.

506
00:33:16,641 --> 00:33:18,230
Speaker 0: I always say I like really hot weather.

507
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,040
Speaker 0: people always a lot of people balk at that.

508
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:27,360
Speaker 0: But I gotta say if it was always 95 degrees and 2% relative humidity I would be a happy rim.

509
00:33:27,741 --> 00:33:30,270
Speaker 0: I can tell you what it was so nice out there.

510
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:36,020
Speaker 1: as long as the showers are cold and there's a fridge rater somewhere I was just perfectly comfortable the whole time.

511
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:41,399
Speaker 0: I didn't even work up a sweat except when I was you know Cleaning out the horses water and giving the goats some hay.

512
00:33:42,541 --> 00:33:47,142
Speaker 1: Now it's are talking about animals camels, right you get to like when you're in the desert in Israel You get to ride the.

513
00:33:47,183 --> 00:33:49,515
Speaker 0: they're really cool, but they smell bad and they'll spit on you.

514
00:33:49,535 --> 00:33:52,420
Speaker 1: No, not really Riding them is not comfortable.

515
00:33:52,581 --> 00:33:53,666
Speaker 1: You're better off walking.

516
00:33:53,726 --> 00:34:00,320
Speaker 1: notice that whenever you see a picture of a guy with a camel all his Cargo is on the camel and he's walking with the camel like held on a leash.

517
00:34:00,801 --> 00:34:01,183
Speaker 1: That's cuz.

518
00:34:01,263 --> 00:34:06,540
Speaker 1: riding the camel sucks it bounces up and down and hurts your ass, you know, my grandpa told me the same thing.

519
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,444
Speaker 0: It's like you.

520
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:10,214
Speaker 0: you lean so far back you feel like you're gonna fall off.

521
00:34:10,475 --> 00:34:12,827
Speaker 0: then you lean so far forward You feel like you're gonna fall off.

522
00:34:12,868 --> 00:34:14,739
Speaker 0: then the camel stops and scratches itself.

523
00:34:15,021 --> 00:34:17,329
Speaker 0: Then you lean so far back you feel like you're gonna fall off.

524
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:18,694
Speaker 1: riding on a camel is not.

525
00:34:18,853 --> 00:34:20,480
Speaker 1: is you're better off walking?

526
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,101
Speaker 1: We didn't do it.

527
00:34:21,123 --> 00:34:22,849
Speaker 1: It's not a camel goes fast either.

528
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:25,339
Speaker 1: I mean if it went fast, you'd be alright, but it doesn't.

529
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,826
Speaker 1: That's why you want a desert horse.

530
00:34:27,348 --> 00:34:29,780
Speaker 1: is that that's comfortable and goes also desert horse.

531
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:36,000
Speaker 0: You could you late and then sweep down upon the caravan slaughter them all with scimitars and take their trade good.

532
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,846
Speaker 1: That's what I'm talking about.

533
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:42,074
Speaker 1: As long as it's an oasis to have the horse drink water Yeah, and if the oasis dries up, well, you better invade another one.

534
00:34:42,096 --> 00:34:44,617
Speaker 1: That's right right with beautiful women.

535
00:34:45,962 --> 00:34:51,040
Speaker 0: So I see my mom and I get picked up and I get back to the house and I got to say I haven't Seen my parents yet out in the desert.

536
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:59,340
Speaker 0: But they have a beautiful freaking house in the middle of nowhere like an hour out of Tucson near this town called Benson But Benson's even not that close.

537
00:35:00,221 --> 00:35:05,280
Speaker 0: They have this beautiful like southern Mexican American Spanish American villa.

538
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,304
Speaker 1: Well, you know desert.

539
00:35:07,365 --> 00:35:08,468
Speaker 1: I mean buying a house.

540
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:14,389
Speaker 1: most of the cost is the land and desert land is cost nothing But it looks like it fits in with the land.

541
00:35:14,429 --> 00:35:15,051
Speaker 0: So well, it's got.

542
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,500
Speaker 0: this beautiful terrace outside is gigantic.

543
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,832
Speaker 0: Yeah, they've got like a covered shed and all this stuff.

544
00:35:20,872 --> 00:35:24,545
Speaker 1: houses like that are real easy to make tons of land And there's a desert.

545
00:35:24,585 --> 00:35:30,826
Speaker 0: so it's not like the natural disaster is gonna destroy it and my parents are really cool So they don't have a green lot or anything.

546
00:35:30,846 --> 00:35:32,754
Speaker 0: They have whatever grew there.

547
00:35:33,035 --> 00:35:34,300
Speaker 0: granted, you know, they're doing a lot of work.

548
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,715
Speaker 0: They pull up all the prickly vines and all the bad things and they burn the brush.

549
00:35:37,756 --> 00:35:38,720
Speaker 0: every few got a cactus.

550
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:44,560
Speaker 0: There's cactuses all over but mostly it's just you know desert trees and I gotta have a big cactus in the front lawn.

551
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,365
Speaker 1: Just you know, I live in Florida I gotta have a palm tree.

552
00:35:46,385 --> 00:35:52,433
Speaker 0: you realize that when those cactuses get to the point Where they grow like they're too little happy arms coming out the side.

553
00:35:52,794 --> 00:35:54,300
Speaker 0: They're already hundreds of years old.

554
00:35:54,701 --> 00:35:57,171
Speaker 0: It's such a fucking crime to harm a cactus there.

555
00:35:57,211 --> 00:36:02,699
Speaker 1: You wouldn't believe I know but that's why I build my house Where the cat where the front lawn would be where the cactus already is.

556
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:08,739
Speaker 0: But uh, the land is big and the dogs the dogs freaking love it out there and I haven't seen those dogs.

557
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:10,404
Speaker 0: and you know Years, I love those dogs.

558
00:36:10,465 --> 00:36:14,579
Speaker 0: I grew up with some of those dogs and I'm very proud that the dogs remembered me.

559
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:16,807
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't know they remembered you.

560
00:36:16,827 --> 00:36:17,068
Speaker 1: they could.

561
00:36:17,088 --> 00:36:18,314
Speaker 1: isn't like it's a man it's man.

562
00:36:18,454 --> 00:36:19,620
Speaker 0: no they remembered me.

563
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:26,572
Speaker 0: They acted quite differently from the way they acted around my uncle Mike uh-huh, but they came out and they have all this land and the Keeley.

564
00:36:26,612 --> 00:36:28,799
Speaker 0: the little Irish Setters showed me around the property like.

565
00:36:28,999 --> 00:36:37,670
Speaker 0: she took Me out and showed me like the whole perimeter and every time I'd stop she like came back and said come on Come on and grab me and made me follow her and Riley just like.

566
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:47,239
Speaker 0: apparently there's this spot where this tortoise comes through every few Days and the tortoise either isn't smart enough to realize that there's a dog there or the tortoise just wants a ride.

567
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:58,015
Speaker 0: because Apparently Riley goat this big Irish setter goes to the spot and always checks if he finds this tortoise He picks it up and runs around with it with like a football for like an hour and then tosses it somewhere.

568
00:36:58,035 --> 00:36:58,818
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

569
00:36:59,721 --> 00:37:02,613
Speaker 0: But driving in I got to say, you know, we're coming down this desert road.

570
00:37:02,633 --> 00:37:03,316
Speaker 0: There's no light.

571
00:37:03,337 --> 00:37:04,120
Speaker 0: We're kicking up dust.

572
00:37:04,941 --> 00:37:17,040
Speaker 0: I saw like 40 jackrabbits running out of the way and kicking and jumping and stomping and then later on I get to you know Right near the house and a quail rock walks by and I I've never seen a quail in person other than in the zoo.

573
00:37:17,141 --> 00:37:24,438
Speaker 0: But quails are really cute when they run because they just kind of run like bit a bit a bit a bit a bit of straight across and they make these really great noises.

574
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:31,508
Speaker 0: and There were like two or three hundred quail and they just kept coming and then every time I tried to drive by they ran one Way or the other across the road.

575
00:37:31,528 --> 00:37:33,180
Speaker 1: I don't think I've ever seen a quail.

576
00:37:33,582 --> 00:37:37,100
Speaker 0: You know what a quail looks like with a little like Bob Lee coming out of the top of his head like quail man.

577
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,544
Speaker 1: I've seen cartoons of quails.

578
00:37:38,604 --> 00:37:39,627
Speaker 0: Have you seen quail man?

579
00:37:39,747 --> 00:37:40,088
Speaker 1: Yes.

580
00:37:40,329 --> 00:37:41,492
Speaker 0: Well, they look a lot like that.

581
00:37:41,512 --> 00:37:44,220
Speaker 0: I figured they're really really cute.

582
00:37:44,842 --> 00:37:47,894
Speaker 0: All right, and of course my mom I didn't like.

583
00:37:47,994 --> 00:37:49,340
Speaker 0: I heard talk but I hadn't met it.

584
00:37:49,802 --> 00:37:52,779
Speaker 0: They have a horse and it's one of the cutest horses I've ever seen.

585
00:37:53,161 --> 00:38:00,725
Speaker 0: She's a half Arabian half quarter horse and she's this really dark not a long horse No quarter cross not like a long cat.

586
00:38:01,327 --> 00:38:04,515
Speaker 0: and she's really smart and really sweet and really pretty.

587
00:38:04,596 --> 00:38:06,120
Speaker 0: and she's just beautiful horse.

588
00:38:06,802 --> 00:38:21,689
Speaker 0: And I spent a lot of time just brushing her and feeding her and cleaning out her stall because I just I wanted to do that and I gotta say like by the second morning getting up and you know carrying hay out to the horse and brushing the horse and cleaning out the water Trough and then giving hay to all the goats.

589
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,396
Speaker 0: and the goats are really friendly.

590
00:38:23,637 --> 00:38:27,110
Speaker 0: They're just like dogs They want to play with you and taking the dogs out.

591
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:33,554
Speaker 0: and you know, I could see myself living that life Just getting up every morning gathering the brush burning it feeding the animals.

592
00:38:34,136 --> 00:38:35,020
Speaker 0: I could live that life.

593
00:38:35,181 --> 00:38:43,200
Speaker 0: I could be one of those pioneer in the desert type guys Drive into town once a week with a pickup truck buy a bunch of hay don't even have to pay because everyone knows me.

594
00:38:43,261 --> 00:38:44,377
Speaker 0: They know I'll pay at some point.

595
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,879
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think I can live that life.

596
00:38:47,141 --> 00:38:53,599
Speaker 0: The only thing is I realized not too long after I got there that in the entire state of Arizona You cannot get pizza.

597
00:38:53,961 --> 00:38:59,702
Speaker 0: There is no pizza worth eating in that entire state the whole state as far as I can tell from everyone I talked to.

598
00:39:00,124 --> 00:39:02,071
Speaker 0: no one in Arizona knows how to make pizza.

599
00:39:02,513 --> 00:39:06,492
Speaker 0: They don't know bread sauce cheese One the water is kind of bad out there.

600
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:08,342
Speaker 0: to one place We went to.

601
00:39:08,362 --> 00:39:11,956
Speaker 1: I mean there's such rapid communication in the world now didn't one place we went to?

602
00:39:11,996 --> 00:39:12,378
Speaker 0: it's like they.

603
00:39:12,398 --> 00:39:13,623
Speaker 0: just they opened A pizza place.

604
00:39:13,865 --> 00:39:16,859
Speaker 0: so you order pizza and they give it to you in your styrofoam box.

605
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,653
Speaker 1: Won't the styrofoam melt and then get on the pizza?

606
00:39:20,713 --> 00:39:24,572
Speaker 0: and even if it doesn't that's gonna be one Soggy ass pizza by the time it gets to you.

607
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:27,667
Speaker 0: It sure is and a lot of them They just don't put yeast in the pizza.

608
00:39:27,687 --> 00:39:32,184
Speaker 0: So it ends up being like this flatbread, but it's not good flatbread It's just crappy flatbread.

609
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:35,054
Speaker 1: how they could go on the internet and look up pizza recipe.

610
00:39:35,114 --> 00:39:36,037
Speaker 0: They just don't think to.

611
00:39:36,117 --> 00:39:36,479
Speaker 0: I don't know.

612
00:39:37,301 --> 00:39:38,606
Speaker 1: How does I don't understand this?

613
00:39:38,666 --> 00:39:38,847
Speaker 1: we?

614
00:39:39,389 --> 00:39:41,295
Speaker 1: it's a known solved problem.

615
00:39:41,315 --> 00:39:42,138
Speaker 1: What do people like?

616
00:39:42,178 --> 00:39:42,619
Speaker 0: I don't get it.

617
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:49,360
Speaker 0: But at the same token I can get good Mexican food anywhere for no money, and I learned something.

618
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:54,560
Speaker 0: I did a bunch of different Mexican places, you know authentic Mexican food real Mexican food with Mexicans.

619
00:39:54,942 --> 00:39:57,600
Speaker 0: You know what it tastes the same as the cafe Maya.

620
00:39:58,011 --> 00:39:59,303
Speaker 0: Yeah 100 percent.

621
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:03,758
Speaker 0: that made me so happy because my mom was like you can't get good Mexican food up there.

622
00:40:03,798 --> 00:40:05,204
Speaker 0: and everything I tried I was like, you know what?

623
00:40:05,666 --> 00:40:08,359
Speaker 0: This is exactly like the cafe Maya up near us.

624
00:40:08,601 --> 00:40:09,123
Speaker 1: But you know what?

625
00:40:09,203 --> 00:40:13,520
Speaker 1: We have one place that has you know Mexican food right like like they have everywhere.

626
00:40:13,881 --> 00:40:16,732
Speaker 1: They have zero places that have pizza like we have here.

627
00:40:16,752 --> 00:40:17,575
Speaker 1: Yeah.

628
00:40:17,595 --> 00:40:18,739
Speaker 1: So what does that tell you?

629
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,932
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time we make pizza down there.

630
00:40:21,013 --> 00:40:27,040
Speaker 1: the way we make it here We can charge a lot of money for it because I'm sure the cafe Maya charges a lot more money for that food than the places down there.

631
00:40:27,201 --> 00:40:33,220
Speaker 0: I think the reason for that is just simply that it's not so much because we live outside of Arizona or that Arizona's weird.

632
00:40:33,562 --> 00:40:41,452
Speaker 0: It's just that we live in downstate New York City where we can get Authentic food from pretty much anywhere in the world if we want.

633
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, we want Somalian food.

634
00:40:44,021 --> 00:40:47,935
Speaker 1: We want Brazilian food, but they don't even have pizza Hut in Arizona.

635
00:40:48,116 --> 00:40:49,140
Speaker 0: Pizza Hut's not pizza.

636
00:40:49,201 --> 00:40:50,720
Speaker 0: That's like saying Taco Bell is tacos.

637
00:40:51,002 --> 00:40:54,120
Speaker 1: I know but I mean it'd be better than the stuff that you're talking about.

638
00:40:54,260 --> 00:41:10,989
Speaker 0: The other thing I noticed driving in there was a surprising number of Japanese or borrows is almost pizza Japanese or quote unquote Japanese or sushi restaurants like a disturbing number between The like the edge of town and the airport.

639
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:19,187
Speaker 0: I saw no less than 35 sushi restaurants 35 I counted Mm-hmm and one.

640
00:41:19,207 --> 00:41:20,572
Speaker 0: I wonder where they get their sushi from.

641
00:41:20,593 --> 00:41:22,340
Speaker 1: that is a good question.

642
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,946
Speaker 1: They imagine the freshest fish.

643
00:41:23,986 --> 00:41:26,515
Speaker 1: I imagine they desert and she's dead.

644
00:41:26,615 --> 00:41:28,000
Speaker 0: I yeah fishes desert.

645
00:41:28,381 --> 00:41:31,915
Speaker 0: There's no fishes in the desert fishes in the sea chickens on the land.

646
00:41:31,955 --> 00:41:33,140
Speaker 1: There's no chickens in the desert either.

647
00:41:33,682 --> 00:41:34,706
Speaker 0: Actually, there are a lot of them.

648
00:41:34,987 --> 00:41:35,830
Speaker 1: Well, what are they eating?

649
00:41:36,352 --> 00:41:38,139
Speaker 0: They're eating seed that you put out for him.

650
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:46,799
Speaker 0: Okay, actually a lot of my parents neighbors have a bunch of chickens and I'm trying to convince cuz my mom wants to start milking the goats and make goat cheese, which I'm all about.

651
00:41:46,819 --> 00:41:49,750
Speaker 0: and I'm trying to convince him to get some chickens too because chickens.

652
00:41:50,011 --> 00:41:54,830
Speaker 0: there's certain breeds of chickens that do really well in the desert and I know my mom would take great care of those chickens.

653
00:41:55,453 --> 00:41:57,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I don't like goat cheese.

654
00:41:57,844 --> 00:41:59,071
Speaker 0: I really what's wrong with you?

655
00:41:59,131 --> 00:42:00,036
Speaker 0: go cheese is awesome.

656
00:42:00,096 --> 00:42:06,403
Speaker 1: plus, you know As you know as much as you would study to me like even if I made goat cheese and studied on the internet how To make it.

657
00:42:06,766 --> 00:42:08,239
Speaker 1: I don't trust it not to be diseased.

658
00:42:08,681 --> 00:42:10,107
Speaker 0: Apparently it's not that hard to make.

659
00:42:10,147 --> 00:42:16,411
Speaker 0: I talked to some locals and a lot of them do it and my mom actually works with This Russian woman who has been pestering her constantly.

660
00:42:16,892 --> 00:42:18,820
Speaker 0: you have a goat and you're not milking it.

661
00:42:19,061 --> 00:42:20,167
Speaker 0: What the hell is wrong with you?

662
00:42:20,227 --> 00:42:20,991
Speaker 0: I'll come and milk it.

663
00:42:21,011 --> 00:42:22,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, just give me that milk.

664
00:42:22,963 --> 00:42:24,820
Speaker 1: I'm crazy rushy woman watch out.

665
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,337
Speaker 0: But actually I ate some Russian food because the woman made us some Russian lunch and it was these.

666
00:42:30,698 --> 00:42:32,540
Speaker 0: they were meatballs But they were Russian meatballs.

667
00:42:33,202 --> 00:42:41,883
Speaker 0: I gotta ask what spices she used because it didn't taste like anything I've ever eaten before but it was awesome like super awesome Mm-hmm.

668
00:42:42,224 --> 00:42:43,890
Speaker 0: We didn't have any Vodak to go with it.

669
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:46,459
Speaker 1: But oh well, they don't have Vodak in Arizona.

670
00:42:46,499 --> 00:42:48,220
Speaker 0: I'll admit I don't know much about Russian food.

671
00:42:48,321 --> 00:42:51,120
Speaker 0: I kind of imagine it's similar to Polish food.

672
00:42:51,582 --> 00:42:55,080
Speaker 0: And the only other thing I can think of is the stereotype of caviar and vodka.

673
00:42:55,822 --> 00:43:01,600
Speaker 1: I know a lot of Eastern European foods while not, you know, exactly identical from country to country are very similar.

674
00:43:01,922 --> 00:43:03,857
Speaker 1: You know, it's sort of like a gradient like the.

675
00:43:03,958 --> 00:43:11,679
Speaker 1: you know It's like you go east and then as you go, you know the Far East like, you know Siberia and as you go west the food changes a little bit more

676
00:43:12,862 --> 00:43:13,805
Speaker 0: Like in France, I mean

677
00:43:13,825 --> 00:43:15,973
Speaker 1: and then like you get to Poland that it's you know, it's food

678
00:43:16,033 --> 00:43:18,163
Speaker 0: in northern France and food in southern France.

679
00:43:18,203 --> 00:43:20,360
Speaker 0: it's all French, but it's very different.

680
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,440
Speaker 0: But yet if you go from south to north like it changes a little bit every time you go to along the way.

681
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:26,679
Speaker 1: Yep, so that's you know, that's what it's sort of like.

682
00:43:26,921 --> 00:43:31,387
Speaker 0: But the scary thing is aside from there being a lot of Japanese food There was a lot of fake Japanese food.

683
00:43:31,888 --> 00:43:36,487
Speaker 0: Like I looked at some of these places and they had sushi and they had you know Japanese food I like.

684
00:43:36,527 --> 00:43:58,178
Speaker 0: but some of these places they're like yes Asian Japanese bowl house and I looked inside and it was just a Chinese restaurant or even worse They had dishes like Asian bowl that had rice and stuff in it Mm-hmm, and even my mom because my mom doesn't like that finding kind of food very much for she was like Yeah, those places are no good, but people around here love them

685
00:43:58,861 --> 00:43:59,383
Speaker 1: Really?

686
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:03,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll get to people eating around there cuz I noticed something disturbing.

687
00:44:04,762 --> 00:44:07,259
Speaker 0: But aside from all that one other thing I know is leading the pizza.

688
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,928
Speaker 1: That's not real you'd be.

689
00:44:08,969 --> 00:44:11,060
Speaker 0: there aren't a lot of national change.

690
00:44:11,161 --> 00:44:13,373
Speaker 0: Like there weren't a lot of McDonald's and there weren't a lot of.

691
00:44:13,393 --> 00:44:14,579
Speaker 1: well, did you go to like, you know?

692
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,225
Speaker 1: Yeah, I heavily populated area.

693
00:44:16,285 --> 00:44:16,546
Speaker 0: I did.

694
00:44:16,606 --> 00:44:17,610
Speaker 0: I also asked a lot of.

695
00:44:17,671 --> 00:44:19,698
Speaker 0: I went through like Tucson, which is a big city.

696
00:44:20,462 --> 00:44:23,358
Speaker 0: I also just talked to a lot of people and people who Phoenix my parents.

697
00:44:23,438 --> 00:44:24,563
Speaker 0: not, you know I asked her out.

698
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:28,617
Speaker 0: I it was weird and my mom was asking me cuz no Walmart.

699
00:44:28,998 --> 00:44:31,410
Speaker 0: There's Walmart Okay, but I'm talking about food wise.

700
00:44:31,491 --> 00:44:33,140
Speaker 1: not that I like that but just you know, yeah

701
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:41,795
Speaker 0: but she even asked me, you know, I'm asking a lot and it's weird how I paid attention to things that I wouldn't have paid attention to if I'd gone there previously just because

702
00:44:41,815 --> 00:44:41,835
Speaker 1: I

703
00:44:42,497 --> 00:44:50,635
Speaker 0: do geek nights and I Kind of looked at a lot of things from a sort of journalistic side Like I thought about what am I gonna say about this experience when I came back.

704
00:44:50,695 --> 00:44:51,820
Speaker 0: and it's weird out.

705
00:44:51,921 --> 00:44:54,320
Speaker 0: Just doing this show has kind of changed the way I look at the world.

706
00:44:54,743 --> 00:44:57,079
Speaker 0: I pay attention to a lot of things I otherwise wouldn't have cared about.

707
00:44:58,341 --> 00:45:06,995
Speaker 0: But while there aren't a lot of McDonald's and Burger Kings all over the place There's a lot of Really really really specific niche only from a certain part of the world.

708
00:45:07,035 --> 00:45:08,300
Speaker 0: a certain part of America change.

709
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,529
Speaker 0: They're like there was a Little Caesars Pizza.

710
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:13,440
Speaker 0: Well, I've never didn't have actual pizza.

711
00:45:13,601 --> 00:45:16,612
Speaker 0: Yes, it tasted exactly like Little Caesars Pizza.

712
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,920
Speaker 1: I'm like, so is the best pizza in Arizona is what you're saying?

713
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,894
Speaker 0: Yeah, while Little Caesars Pizza is not good from a pizza perspective.

714
00:45:23,075 --> 00:45:24,440
Speaker 0: I love Little Caesars Pizza.

715
00:45:24,601 --> 00:45:31,842
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure if you went to like a baseball stadium or something or the football stadium You might have been able to get real pizza Possibly.

716
00:45:31,903 --> 00:45:38,040
Speaker 0: but at every place like Phoenix I got my mom has been looking around I gotta imagine this pizza in Phoenix somewhere.

717
00:45:38,401 --> 00:45:39,305
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's hard to find.

718
00:45:39,325 --> 00:45:42,840
Speaker 0: you have to go to like a fancy Italian restaurant and they'll make you a good pizza.

719
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,004
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, but

720
00:45:44,445 --> 00:46:03,740
Speaker 0: there was a Little Caesars and there's Jack in the Box, which wasn't really common elsewhere but in the cities there was a couple of them and So many of these little chains that I found out why from all the locals that most of the people living in Arizona especially in the cities are not Arizona natives their transplants from all over the country who just decided screw it.

721
00:46:03,881 --> 00:46:05,552
Speaker 0: I'm done with this snow bullshit.

722
00:46:05,874 --> 00:46:06,760
Speaker 0: I'm moving to Arizona.

723
00:46:06,941 --> 00:46:12,280
Speaker 1: Yep, a lot of old people move out there just as many as move to Florida and those people are kind of adventurous.

724
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:18,040
Speaker 0: A lot of them don't like, you know, normal fast food, whatever but at the same time they miss whatever their local thing was.

725
00:46:18,581 --> 00:46:24,340
Speaker 0: So there's a lot of money in finding out where people came from in Arizona and making whatever local chain.

726
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:28,740
Speaker 0: My mom wrote to White Castle and was like you should open a White Castle here.

727
00:46:28,901 --> 00:46:30,788
Speaker 0: Oh my god, and you know what they said?

728
00:46:30,809 --> 00:46:30,869
Speaker 0: Hmm.

729
00:46:31,592 --> 00:46:32,877
Speaker 0: You know how many letters we get.

730
00:46:32,938 --> 00:46:33,500
Speaker 0: we're trying.

731
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:34,604
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

732
00:46:34,705 --> 00:46:36,779
Speaker 1: Are they trying to come up with to the health standard or what?

733
00:46:38,181 --> 00:46:47,560
Speaker 0: Actually, that's a problem because remember our friend Kate's trying to get Wegmans out, you know in New York around here The problem is just you know White Castle or Wegmans or whatever have distributors in a certain area.

734
00:46:48,002 --> 00:46:51,540
Speaker 0: You got to get similar distributors in other places and sometimes that's hard.

735
00:46:51,741 --> 00:46:54,700
Speaker 1: You got to have a truck show up every day with new White Castles.

736
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,253
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what a truck has to come from somewhere.

737
00:46:57,454 --> 00:46:58,680
Speaker 0: but White Castle is a warehouse.

738
00:46:59,405 --> 00:47:01,320
Speaker 1: You can't have a whole warehouse just for one White Castle.

739
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:06,122
Speaker 1: You need to open a whole bunch of White Castles to support that warehouse and it takes a lot of time to set up that Warehouse.

740
00:47:06,142 --> 00:47:08,900
Speaker 1: and then how does this stuff get to that warehouse from some other warehouse?

741
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:09,401
Speaker 1: But bigger?

742
00:47:09,522 --> 00:47:11,610
Speaker 0: just the fact that White Castle responded right away.

743
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:13,277
Speaker 0: I was like, seriously, we know.

744
00:47:13,457 --> 00:47:15,160
Speaker 1: Oh my god It's probably their form letter.

745
00:47:15,901 --> 00:47:20,220
Speaker 0: No, they told her like we've gotten four other specific letters about this in the past month.

746
00:47:20,481 --> 00:47:21,066
Speaker 0: Believe me.

747
00:47:21,086 --> 00:47:23,019
Speaker 0: We will tell you when one comes.

748
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,047
Speaker 0: But yeah, I was just thinking about that.

749
00:47:26,087 --> 00:47:29,540
Speaker 0: cuz actually I'm really hungry right now and I'm also the hungry.

750
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,575
Speaker 0: I kind of want to like it the hunger.

751
00:47:31,595 --> 00:47:41,332
Speaker 0: No But now my mom brought this up long before I made any Observation and you know even Emily's been making fun of me.

752
00:47:41,352 --> 00:47:54,973
Speaker 0: because lately whenever someone's in my way I'm always like yeah fat people and a lot of times I almost say it not even in the Fat people but it's like a generic term for people in my way like not fat of the body but fat of the mind And I just I use the word more than I show

753
00:47:54,993 --> 00:47:55,880
Speaker 1: fat of the character.

754
00:47:56,211 --> 00:47:57,082
Speaker 0: Yeah like.

755
00:47:57,283 --> 00:48:11,262
Speaker 0: there are fat people who are jolly and awesome and there are skinny people who are Indignant and crappy and I I got to pick a better word I guess but I'm never gonna complain about fat people as in obese at New York State again Because good.

756
00:48:11,282 --> 00:48:15,979
Speaker 1: Well, even if you're at IBM and there's a lady taking up the entire hallway is that was only one lady?

757
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:22,699
Speaker 0: Good fucking God are the majority of people other than like the workers like the?

758
00:48:22,739 --> 00:48:24,607
Speaker 0: you know The Mexican workers and the laborers.

759
00:48:25,209 --> 00:48:27,900
Speaker 0: they're so fat and there's so many of it.

760
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,666
Speaker 0: And my mom was like she like when I came.

761
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:30,047
Speaker 0: she's like.

762
00:48:30,809 --> 00:48:34,140
Speaker 0: then you won't believe how many people are fat around here.

763
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:37,293
Speaker 0: And I was like whatever, you know my oh my god.

764
00:48:37,313 --> 00:48:41,831
Speaker 0: the majority of human beings I saw were scared not like, you know a little overweight.

765
00:48:41,871 --> 00:48:43,096
Speaker 0: cuz you know, there's nothing wrong with that.

766
00:48:43,458 --> 00:48:51,470
Speaker 0: I'm talking medically Dangerously scarily obese Mm-hmm and all of them are also transplants.

767
00:48:51,932 --> 00:48:54,340
Speaker 0: and the thing I don't get is why they move to the desert.

768
00:48:54,461 --> 00:48:55,526
Speaker 0: How can they bear it?

769
00:48:55,989 --> 00:48:58,039
Speaker 0: It's so hot and they're so big.

770
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:01,894
Speaker 1: I'm trying to look up like what's the fattest state in Mississippi?

771
00:49:02,115 --> 00:49:03,420
Speaker 1: I know but try to look up like a list.

772
00:49:03,501 --> 00:49:05,936
Speaker 1: I know Mississippi's the fattest but I want to see like the second.

773
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:06,178
Speaker 1: third.

774
00:49:06,218 --> 00:49:07,365
Speaker 0: fourth I don't remember.

775
00:49:07,426 --> 00:49:12,840
Speaker 0: all I know is that Colorado's the leanest Yeah, and New York City is actually like the leanest urban center.

776
00:49:12,941 --> 00:49:17,625
Speaker 0: But the thing is there's nothing wrong with being a little fat or a little, you know Chubby or whatever.

777
00:49:17,665 --> 00:49:18,732
Speaker 0: cuz you know what.

778
00:49:18,773 --> 00:49:24,817
Speaker 0: not everyone has to be rail thing But if you weigh more than 200 pounds more than you should.

779
00:49:24,897 --> 00:49:25,700
Speaker 0: something's wrong.

780
00:49:25,861 --> 00:49:28,280
Speaker 1: Okay, so I can't got on the numbers for Arizona, right?

781
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:33,654
Speaker 1: But apparently Arizona has less than 25% adult obesity, Mississippi has 29 and a half percent.

782
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:39,380
Speaker 0: You know, that's the thing the the illegals because there's a lot of them.

783
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,550
Speaker 0: I even talked to a few but I'm not gonna cuz.

784
00:49:41,751 --> 00:49:43,800
Speaker 0: the opinions in Arizona are very mixed about that.

785
00:49:44,141 --> 00:49:45,146
Speaker 0: It's kind of interesting cuz.

786
00:49:45,186 --> 00:49:45,688
Speaker 0: on one hand.

787
00:49:45,728 --> 00:49:51,445
Speaker 0: They're like a lot of people I talked to were yeah I don't want them coming in illegal But at the other hand they're like.

788
00:49:51,726 --> 00:49:56,201
Speaker 0: I really want them to come in legally because they work really hard and they're really really nice People.

789
00:49:56,422 --> 00:50:01,460
Speaker 1: so I'm looking at the map of the states that have more than 25% adult obesity all in the southwest.

790
00:50:01,702 --> 00:50:03,674
Speaker 1: No, it's pretty much Michigan.

791
00:50:04,016 --> 00:50:04,620
Speaker 1: It's a straight.

792
00:50:05,462 --> 00:50:11,340
Speaker 1: People are super fat in Michigan, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas.

793
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:13,729
Speaker 1: You know what it is down to Texas straight what it is.

794
00:50:13,769 --> 00:50:15,897
Speaker 1: and then South Carolina and West Virginia.

795
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:16,520
Speaker 0: That's it.

796
00:50:16,783 --> 00:50:17,857
Speaker 0: That's where all the corn is.

797
00:50:18,844 --> 00:50:20,512
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even that's where the corn is.

798
00:50:20,572 --> 00:50:24,312
Speaker 1: the same amount of corn gets eaten everywhere Maybe but maybe there's more corn there.

799
00:50:24,534 --> 00:50:25,600
Speaker 0: Maybe there's corn in the air.

800
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:27,808
Speaker 1: I think it's just the lifestyle of the Midwest.

801
00:50:27,988 --> 00:50:29,935
Speaker 1: Yeah is is the most.

802
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:31,320
Speaker 1: sit around do nothing ist.

803
00:50:32,358 --> 00:50:35,994
Speaker 1: Ah Yeah, the most driving ist the least walking ist.

804
00:50:36,295 --> 00:50:38,727
Speaker 0: Oh, that's the other thing I gotta say.

805
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:43,188
Speaker 0: when I was going you know 85 miles an hour 90 miles an hour.

806
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:49,495
Speaker 0: and I saw a cop and I go ah shit and I slow down to 75 And my mom says why'd you slow down?

807
00:50:49,535 --> 00:50:50,340
Speaker 0: you weren't speeding?

808
00:50:52,081 --> 00:50:54,971
Speaker 0: And even better the cop I passed wasn't even a cop.

809
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:55,954
Speaker 0: It was Border Patrol.

810
00:50:55,974 --> 00:50:59,631
Speaker 0: They don't care if someone's going 150 They're just watching for unless 150 full of Mexicans.

811
00:50:59,651 --> 00:51:14,160
Speaker 0: Yeah But really that the the whole you know immigration debate down there Being down there really puts a different perspective on it because on one hand They really are putting a big strain on the educational system and on a health care system.

812
00:51:14,622 --> 00:51:27,520
Speaker 0: But at the same time and no one I talked to disagreed They're really nice people and they work really hard and everyone I talked to really wanted a system where they could come here Illegally as long as they weren't let in illegally.

813
00:51:27,962 --> 00:51:32,278
Speaker 0: they should be citizens and they should get help and they should you know get classes to learn English.

814
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:38,020
Speaker 0: and The sentiment among a lot of those people was that they and this is the sentiment of those people.

815
00:51:38,141 --> 00:51:42,066
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna say my opinion either way But I'm just gonna paraphrase.

816
00:51:42,467 --> 00:51:47,586
Speaker 0: those people work a lot harder and try a lot harder than that people know don't then?

817
00:51:47,606 --> 00:51:57,520
Speaker 0: a lot of people who were born in this country and A lot of those people probably deserve to be here more than a lot of people who live here now That's for sure, and I don't know how I feel.

818
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:02,520
Speaker 0: I mean, it's a complicated issue, but it's interesting to hear the perspectives of people are actually down there.

819
00:52:02,601 --> 00:52:11,660
Speaker 0: You know dealing with this problem Yeah, but at the same time while a lot there's a lot of problems with people not speaking English Most people down there speak English.

820
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:18,820
Speaker 0: In fact more of the people I talked to even some illegal immigrants spoke more English than people running the white castles up in the Bronx.

821
00:52:20,254 --> 00:52:23,093
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, I could probably talk for another hour.

822
00:52:23,113 --> 00:52:41,463
Speaker 0: I don't want to borrow everyone but Arizona at least you know Tucson out in the middle of the desert is a really nice place and I'll save this for another time because I got a whole show I can do about my childhood because My mom gave me I found all the things that I've left with my parents from when I was a kid all the essays I wrote.

823
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:44,980
Speaker 0: I read a Christmas list that I wrote when I was in fourth grade.

824
00:52:45,706 --> 00:52:51,385
Speaker 1: Yeah All that kind of stuff is mostly at my parents house and a lot of it's thrown out Whatever.

825
00:52:51,586 --> 00:52:58,540
Speaker 0: my mom gave me my high school class ring Which on one side has a picture of a trumpet and on the other side has a picture of a dragon.

826
00:52:58,681 --> 00:52:59,733
Speaker 1: I just always had mine.

827
00:52:59,794 --> 00:53:00,360
Speaker 1: It's over there.

828
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,994
Speaker 1: I think it has like a computer on one side and then something else on the other side.

829
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:04,395
Speaker 1: the best

830
00:53:04,456 --> 00:53:17,323
Speaker 0: thing was my mom gave Me a bunch of pictures I had and one of them was a photograph of my bedroom in high school And I'm going to scan that in and kind of put a bunch of call-out boxes to point out cuz I Was such a dork.

831
00:53:17,704 --> 00:53:28,000
Speaker 0: in this picture offhand from memory visible are like 40 forgotten realms books For container ends so many pewter dragons and wizards and crystals.

832
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,204
Speaker 1: I don't waste the money on those.

833
00:53:29,304 --> 00:53:43,730
Speaker 0: a wizard staff a bet a bastard sword a bunch of Atari games all The manga I owned which constituted a good majority of the manga in the state of Michigan Like displayed prominently as prized possessions.

834
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:54,346
Speaker 0: I had comic books in those days all of Sailor Moon along with End of Evangelion in fan sub form a Big like Les Miserables poster.

835
00:53:54,727 --> 00:53:58,979
Speaker 0: two Star Wars posters one of which is tasteful one of which is 14 year old tasteful.

836
00:54:01,162 --> 00:54:04,332
Speaker 0: It was so nostalgic the fridge that was full of dr.

837
00:54:04,372 --> 00:54:05,355
Speaker 0: Pepper and nothing more.

838
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:06,760
Speaker 1: yeah, I guess it's kind of weird.

839
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:07,402
Speaker 1: It's like you.

840
00:54:07,683 --> 00:54:10,474
Speaker 1: you know like what was the last time you were in that house.

841
00:54:10,494 --> 00:54:12,120
Speaker 1: You know like a zillion years ago.

842
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:12,784
Speaker 0: It's like I.

843
00:54:13,268 --> 00:54:15,140
Speaker 1: I was in that it was in my bedroom.

844
00:54:15,321 --> 00:54:20,260
Speaker 1: I had the same bedroom since I was like three and it's still there, and I still go to it.

845
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:23,940
Speaker 1: It's largely intact and my brother lived in it alone for a few years.

846
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:25,750
Speaker 1: So he messed it up and made it sort of his.

847
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:27,420
Speaker 1: but most of my stuff is still there.

848
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,408
Speaker 1: So it's kind of like seeing a picture of.

849
00:54:29,448 --> 00:54:30,593
