1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,708
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday July 11th.

2
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:12,972
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,273 --> 00:00:15,720
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek night.

4
00:00:16,622 --> 00:00:18,599
Speaker 1: Tonight we begin convention season.

5
00:00:24,332 --> 00:00:25,386
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,557 --> 00:00:33,799
Speaker 1: Well, there's no more denying it It is fully 100% con season.

7
00:00:33,839 --> 00:00:44,542
Speaker 1: Scott and I are not going to have a moment's rest Until the Monday after Otakon when we wake up on the beach and do not leave it For about nine days or so.

8
00:00:44,603 --> 00:00:46,030
Speaker 0: give or take yes something like that.

9
00:00:46,251 --> 00:00:50,930
Speaker 1: I might leave the beach after a couple of days to go play some DDR, but then it's right back to that Beach.

10
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:55,490
Speaker 0: Yep, also might go away from the beach to just throw some money down a toilet.

11
00:00:55,692 --> 00:00:57,050
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I also come back.

12
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,470
Speaker 1: Well the last time we threw money down that toilet a whole bunch of more money came back.

13
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:08,930
Speaker 0: Well, you know it wasn't my fault that someone clogged up the toilet And all this other money someone else threw down there shoved right back up and into my wallet.

14
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,390
Speaker 1: I gotta say anecdotal evidence doesn't mean much.

15
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:18,790
Speaker 1: but from the perspective of the experiences of myself and Scott gambling is Awesome, and I'll just give you free money.

16
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:19,878
Speaker 0: Well, I think I don't need to do.

17
00:01:19,918 --> 00:01:21,370
Speaker 0: we don't need to do a whole episode about this.

18
00:01:21,651 --> 00:01:23,277
Speaker 0: No, we have one thing to say about gambling.

19
00:01:23,718 --> 00:01:26,890
Speaker 0: gambling in a casino is no different than playing an arcade.

20
00:01:27,131 --> 00:01:35,360
Speaker 0: You spend money to get entertainment and then the entertainment is quick and over, you know It's like putting 50 cents in a time crisis machine.

21
00:01:35,842 --> 00:01:38,890
Speaker 0: isn't really that different from putting 50 cents in a slot machine?

22
00:01:39,011 --> 00:01:41,991
Speaker 1: Well, unless you're playing gigawing because then you can play for like an hour I know.

23
00:01:42,012 --> 00:01:46,045
Speaker 0: but the you know, the the time the entertainment you're getting is much less.

24
00:01:46,126 --> 00:01:48,877
Speaker 0: but the chance of winning money You know if you like that's.

25
00:01:48,978 --> 00:01:50,867
Speaker 0: if that entertains you then that's oh, man.

26
00:01:51,712 --> 00:02:01,390
Speaker 1: I just to this day and this has been a fantasy of mine as a kid Imagine a real arcade with real games where somehow no one will ever allow a game of skill to award you money.

27
00:02:01,692 --> 00:02:03,303
Speaker 1: I know I know but I can dream.

28
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:07,962
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can dream Yes, but anyway cuz let me tell you Rampart world champion.

29
00:02:07,982 --> 00:02:15,250
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah the key to a casino is You have to assume that any money you gamble at a casino is gone.

30
00:02:15,632 --> 00:02:16,214
Speaker 0: You're just spend.

31
00:02:16,275 --> 00:02:17,942
Speaker 0: it's like spending money on time crisis.

32
00:02:17,962 --> 00:02:18,766
Speaker 0: You spent the money.

33
00:02:18,826 --> 00:02:19,710
Speaker 0: It's never coming back.

34
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:20,899
Speaker 0: That's how you have to assume.

35
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:25,270
Speaker 1: when I was a kid and I went to the arcade I had my five dollars are usually more like two dollars.

36
00:02:25,431 --> 00:02:26,356
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I put it in.

37
00:02:26,436 --> 00:02:28,830
Speaker 1: I get my tokens and I had to spend all those tokens.

38
00:02:29,152 --> 00:02:33,859
Speaker 0: So when you go to a casino you do the same thing You're putting money you turn the money into chips.

39
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,224
Speaker 0: That money is gone.

40
00:02:35,284 --> 00:02:36,790
Speaker 0: Pretend the money's never coming back.

41
00:02:37,373 --> 00:02:45,129
Speaker 0: Then you go and play games with your tokens chips until you're done having fun or until you run out of tokens and chips.

42
00:02:45,149 --> 00:02:51,651
Speaker 0: and Then if you have any left over the casino just happens to be nicer than the arcade and they let you turn it back into Money.

43
00:02:52,274 --> 00:02:53,097
Speaker 0: now arcade doesn't?

44
00:02:53,137 --> 00:02:53,318
Speaker 0: that's.

45
00:02:53,338 --> 00:02:54,041
Speaker 0: that's how it works.

46
00:02:54,101 --> 00:02:57,537
Speaker 1: If you feel the urge to go buy more chips Hit yourself.

47
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:58,603
Speaker 1: just hit yourself.

48
00:02:58,683 --> 00:02:59,830
Speaker 0: You never buy more chips.

49
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,035
Speaker 0: Let's like you go to the arcade.

50
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:04,110
Speaker 0: you put a 20 in the change machine and you don't get any more.

51
00:03:04,591 --> 00:03:05,635
Speaker 0: Same thing at the casino.

52
00:03:05,876 --> 00:03:09,990
Speaker 0: you take $200 and you say this $200 is going away and never coming back.

53
00:03:10,471 --> 00:03:15,190
Speaker 1: Now by the same you never put any more in if you get ahead by an amount of money.

54
00:03:15,652 --> 00:03:25,395
Speaker 1: That would be nice if you had yeah say a jackpot I. just if you get ahead to the point where getting that amount of money suddenly in cash would be a a Significant boon to your life.

55
00:03:25,556 --> 00:03:27,161
Speaker 1: Hey, fuck immediately.

56
00:03:27,201 --> 00:03:27,402
Speaker 0: Yes.

57
00:03:27,523 --> 00:03:28,365
Speaker 0: Hey lose it all.

58
00:03:28,426 --> 00:03:30,989
Speaker 0: I just won ten grand That could pay off my car.

59
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:38,948
Speaker 1: I will cash out now and not continue playing any games because the odds are always in the casinos favor if you have a good luck streak.

60
00:03:39,732 --> 00:03:41,939
Speaker 1: The odds are that will not continue.

61
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:47,270
Speaker 0: because I'm if you just sit in the casino and play forever You will eventually lose everything.

62
00:03:47,551 --> 00:03:52,108
Speaker 1: That's why rich people gamble because if you have a lot of money to gamble you can ride out the bad luck.

63
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:52,750
Speaker 1: and then when?

64
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,907
Speaker 1: You have good luck Once you break even or get above you cash out as soon as you've broken even or gotten above.

65
00:03:57,927 --> 00:04:03,128
Speaker 0: Yep Of course a lot of you know, eventually you just won't get a good luck streak and you lose all your money.

66
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:04,415
Speaker 0: Yep That's why I got us.

67
00:04:04,737 --> 00:04:09,002
Speaker 0: That's why guys who run casinos are loaded Man, we should run a casino.

68
00:04:09,022 --> 00:04:09,830
Speaker 0: We should anyway.

69
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,911
Speaker 1: So so we've talked about this a couple of times in the last week or two and I like to bring it up one more Time.

70
00:04:16,413 --> 00:04:21,550
Speaker 1: we have already got two fine upstanding gentlemen who are going to hopefully put on one hell of a show for us.

71
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:25,925
Speaker 1: We've got some guest hosts for next week for the Wednesday night show two weeks from now.

75
00:04:32,131 --> 00:04:39,808

76
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:42,240
Speaker 1: last year We had our Richard and Allison from movies.

77
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,849
Speaker 1: You should see and they did a bang-up job.

78
00:04:44,693 --> 00:04:49,350
Speaker 1: This year we've got two unnamed individuals for whom I have nothing but the highest of esteem.

79
00:04:49,932 --> 00:04:51,576
Speaker 0: Well, I didn't give it away at all.

80
00:04:51,937 --> 00:04:55,668
Speaker 1: It could be Darryl and Gerald and not Clarissa because I said gentlemen.

81
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:59,019
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, cuz I didn't say there wasn't a lady.

Speaker 1: Yeah, it's definitely anime world order.

84
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,143
Speaker 1: I can tell you that it has nothing to do with karate or yeah.

85
00:05:06,504 --> 00:05:06,765
Speaker 1: Yeah.

86
00:05:07,086 --> 00:05:08,270
Speaker 1: Oh, I guess I ruined it there.

87
00:05:08,571 --> 00:05:09,074
Speaker 0: Yeah, you did.

88
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:09,838
Speaker 1: You know what though?

89
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,977
Speaker 1: an ulterior motive and I'm gonna be Forthright and tell you all my ulterior motive.

93
00:05:19,936 --> 00:05:25,429
Speaker 0: while I am looking forward to what they come up with I did have a feeling that they would not come through and end up.

94
00:05:25,611 --> 00:05:28,289
Speaker 0: You know cuz I mean how long did it take them to do the valiant denims?

95
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,355
Speaker 1: See I told them though.

96
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:30,823
Speaker 1: They all they have to do is record the show.

97
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:32,130
Speaker 1: They don't have to edit it at all.

98
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,094
Speaker 1: I'll take care of all that.

99
00:05:33,114 --> 00:05:34,418
Speaker 1: All right, even better.

100
00:05:34,438 --> 00:05:39,098
Speaker 1: I know that they would have come through eventually because they're that way They'll always finish what they started.

101
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:40,848
Speaker 1: eventually might take a year or two.

Speaker 1: Yep Oh, well, so my last call if any of you out there now when I say any of you, you're all welcome to try but Seriously, we mean people who have podcast or audio experience or you think you can do a really good job with this.

108
00:06:25,561 --> 00:06:28,390

00:06:45,091 --> 00:06:48,437

116
00:06:48,558 --> 00:06:53,529
Speaker 1: but don't ask because if you have to ask you're not gonna be a moderate and I think we Need a secretary to read our email to us.

119
00:07:03,722 --> 00:07:05,710
Speaker 1: All I want to say is try next year.

120
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:09,042
Speaker 1: All you got to do is have a year of experience and you'll probably be good enough.

121
00:07:09,223 --> 00:07:09,424
Speaker 0: Yep.

122
00:07:09,885 --> 00:07:11,110
Speaker 1: It's just a matter of experience.

123
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:15,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, we don't want to put like, you know, so like memory we did that worst podcast episode.

124
00:07:16,152 --> 00:07:16,996
Speaker 1: Yeah, we wouldn't let.

125
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,705
Speaker 0: what was that terrible terrible podcast?

126
00:07:18,725 --> 00:07:19,469
Speaker 1: what anime Paul's?

127
00:07:21,415 --> 00:07:23,541
Speaker 0: The one with the little kids, oh that one.

128
00:07:23,802 --> 00:07:25,908
Speaker 0: yeah, we don't want that to go in our feet.

129
00:07:25,948 --> 00:07:29,390
Speaker 0: I mean More power to you doing that kind of thing.

130
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:33,330
Speaker 0: I mean, it's awesome that you you know care about us so much that you'll make a nice episode.

131
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,397
Speaker 0: But yeah, we have standards.

132
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:38,748
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I don't really mean to rag on anime Paul's you guys are cool.

133
00:07:38,788 --> 00:07:42,510
Speaker 1: It's just that You guys have been coming up in our forums a lot lately.

134
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:48,189
Speaker 0: Is that people just keep mentioning them when they were probably one of the least worst even though in fact You still made the worst?

135
00:07:48,631 --> 00:07:49,032
Speaker 1: I would just.

136
00:07:49,072 --> 00:07:54,828
Speaker 1: I would contend that anime Paul's is better than a full majority of podcasts in the world.

137
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:58,456
Speaker 1: Probably Sadly podcasts are usually not that good.

138
00:07:58,657 --> 00:07:59,961
Speaker 1: Yes, but I digress.

139
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:06,085
Speaker 0: so that means they're in the top either in the top 51% Of podcasts which is bad because 90% of podcasts suck.

140
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,721
Speaker 1: Anyway, oh, yeah times.

141
00:08:10,283 --> 00:08:11,407
Speaker 1: one other little quick thing.

142
00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:12,190
Speaker 1: I just want to get this out.

143
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:16,290
Speaker 1: I'm not doing a news tonight partly because I'm really tired and partly because I have a really tired.

144
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:24,661
Speaker 1: I have a very fancy new piece of equipment that we got air freighted overnight to us for Connecticut and Otacon And I really want to push all these buttons.

145
00:08:25,144 --> 00:08:28,158
Speaker 0: There aren't too many buttons on it I know but each one of them does a lot.

146
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:30,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, they feel good when you press them, too.

147
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,982
Speaker 1: They have that little funk of a high-quality device.

148
00:08:33,004 --> 00:08:33,385
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

149
00:08:34,211 --> 00:08:36,379
Speaker 1: Anyway, so uh a while ago.

150
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,604
Speaker 1: We did our show on Ava.

151
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:46,581
Speaker 1: We reviewed Ava despite all inclinations that we probably shouldn't tackle something like that and We said we're gonna do a final thoughts episode complete with spoilers.

152
00:08:47,143 --> 00:08:49,696
Speaker 1: and I figured this time unlike with other shows We've spoiled.

153
00:08:50,221 --> 00:08:51,070
Speaker 1: I want to give you some time.

154
00:08:51,111 --> 00:08:52,429
Speaker 1: We're not gonna do this for a month or two.

155
00:08:52,530 --> 00:09:01,624
Speaker 1: So if you want to hear our final thoughts on Ava and you don't want to have to skip an episode of geek night sometime In September or October, I'd recommend watching Ava in the next few months.

156
00:09:02,226 --> 00:09:03,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, I gotta watch it again.

157
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,775
Speaker 0: I haven't seen it in years.

158
00:09:04,895 --> 00:09:06,420
Speaker 1: I've seen it a good five times.

159
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,603
Speaker 1: So I think I'm good.

160
00:09:07,643 --> 00:09:08,646
Speaker 0: two times maybe.

161
00:09:08,947 --> 00:09:13,485
Speaker 0: I think yeah The second time and all of those are freshman year at RIT, so I haven't seen it since 2000.

162
00:09:13,485 --> 00:09:16,628
Speaker 1: Wow God I think we did watch it twice at RIT.

163
00:09:16,971 --> 00:09:20,224
Speaker 0: I know I watched it once by myself and then once with everyone else.

164
00:09:20,345 --> 00:09:21,610
Speaker 1: we marathoned it at RIT.

165
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,776
Speaker 1: I didn't stay for the whole thing.

166
00:09:23,298 --> 00:09:24,565
Speaker 1: Ah, I just subbed for someone.

167
00:09:24,746 --> 00:09:25,470
Speaker 0: I didn't do that.

168
00:09:25,892 --> 00:09:26,957
Speaker 1: Anyway, that's my news.

169
00:09:27,017 --> 00:09:35,795
Speaker 1: geek night stuff and to anyone who comes to the cons We're gonna talk about I'm gonna have something really fancy and I'm gonna be carrying it around and babying it and shoving microphones in People's faces.

170
00:09:35,957 --> 00:09:36,320
Speaker 0: great.

171
00:09:36,924 --> 00:09:40,453
Speaker 1: It's gonna be grand All right, so What?

172
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:51,410
Speaker 0: two weeks ago was anime Expo and for those of you who do not know Anime Expo is the biggest anime convention in North America outside of Japan.

173
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:56,990
Speaker 0: I think they claim to have 40,000 plus people in attendance, but we're not sure how they count those numbers.

174
00:09:57,453 --> 00:10:00,090
Speaker 0: So, you know, it could be that includes dealers.

175
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:03,464
Speaker 0: It could be they count people for three days if they come for the whole week.

176
00:10:03,485 --> 00:10:04,690
Speaker 0: Well, actually it's a four-day con.

177
00:10:05,532 --> 00:10:10,969
Speaker 0: So, you know that that immediately adds because they have the Thursday only people coming in and stuff like that, right?

178
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:15,082
Speaker 0: But anyway, it is the biggest con regardless of the accuracy of their attendance numbers.

179
00:10:15,242 --> 00:10:17,268
Speaker 1: granted Otacon is clear and far away.

180
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:18,292
Speaker 1: number two It's not like.

181
00:10:18,312 --> 00:10:21,763
Speaker 0: there's any contention and I have never been west of Michigan.

182
00:10:21,783 --> 00:10:22,526
Speaker 0: I have

183
00:10:22,586 --> 00:10:23,710
Speaker 1: never been west of Chicago

184
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:36,329
Speaker 0: yes, so neither of us have ever been to anime Expo and everything we know about it is from what we read of people's testimonies who have gone there and Things we read on the internet about the convention, that's all we know about it.

185
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:44,760
Speaker 1: Yep this year's been a little bit of an exception just in that there was a lot of anime Expo news leading up to the con and I read it all and I was actually excited about it.

186
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:52,010
Speaker 0: Yes, see our prior to this year Our general opinion of anime Expo was that it was a very industry convention, which is true.

187
00:10:52,291 --> 00:11:00,470
Speaker 0: it is a very industry convention and we tend to more like the Fan-run conventions than the industry convention, you know Otacon, KatsuKan.

188
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:07,230
Speaker 0: Yes, that's why we tend to not like comic conventions because comic conventions are very industry but like mocha is very not industry.

189
00:11:07,331 --> 00:11:08,422
Speaker 0: That's why we like it so much.

190
00:11:08,947 --> 00:11:14,410
Speaker 0: So You know cuz also when you go to an industry con we could probably do an episode about industry for his fan cons.

191
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:15,193
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's do that.

192
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:15,755
Speaker 0: All right.

193
00:11:15,835 --> 00:11:22,424
Speaker 0: Well, we'll not talk about it then but our general opinion of anime expo Is that a it's big it's industry.

194
00:11:22,504 --> 00:11:24,675
Speaker 0: We don't really care about it This year.

195
00:11:24,856 --> 00:11:37,090
Speaker 0: looking at all the press releases from anime Expo online I actually thought maybe they were gonna clean ourselves up, you know Maybe they were gonna be pretty awesome this year because the programming they had lined up on paper was awesome.

196
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:44,483
Speaker 0: They had that skin concert with I talked that was a news a few weeks ago Yeah, Yoshiki and gacked in the same band and it was crazy.

197
00:11:44,523 --> 00:11:46,310
Speaker 1: That's just that's absolutely unbelievable.

198
00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:53,822
Speaker 0: That's pretty much as big as the world premiere of a brand new band with like two of the biggest Rockstars in Japan in the same band.

199
00:11:53,842 --> 00:11:55,150
Speaker 0: That's just craziness.

200
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:57,260
Speaker 0: So they had that.

201
00:11:57,601 --> 00:11:59,410
Speaker 0: they also had a whole bunch of other stuff.

202
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:03,990
Speaker 0: There was like multiple concerts and and all sorts of other crazy awesome events.

203
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,646
Speaker 0: I'm not even gonna list him because you can just go read the press releases.

204
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:07,270
Speaker 0: anime Expo.

205
00:12:07,431 --> 00:12:11,754
Speaker 0: But I was very like I if anime Expo was closer I would have just gone.

206
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:15,230
Speaker 0: be just for the programming that they said they were gonna have I would have as well.

207
00:12:15,632 --> 00:12:27,578
Speaker 1: I mean, it doesn't draw me as hard as Pax does but that's because Pax is very special in that It's really I mean while it is nominally the penny arcade expo, it's really the rim has a nerdgasm Expo pretty much every year.

208
00:12:27,699 --> 00:12:29,927
Speaker 1: I look at packs and I just yearn for it.

209
00:12:30,289 --> 00:12:37,010
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, the best most enticing programming of any convention, you know for the cost of this Marantz one of us could have gone.

210
00:12:37,534 --> 00:12:38,622
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's that's cool.

211
00:12:38,803 --> 00:12:44,021
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Apparently according to the Internet's again because it's all I know about anime Expo.

212
00:12:44,342 --> 00:12:46,269
Speaker 0: So this could be completely wrong, but I doubt it.

213
00:12:47,212 --> 00:12:52,481
Speaker 0: Anime Expo did have all this awesome programming but they had big problems.

214
00:12:52,542 --> 00:12:53,048
Speaker 0: this year.

215
00:12:53,210 --> 00:13:05,850
Speaker 1: apparently these reports are Quite a bit more widespread than what you would normally get at a con because every anime con ever in the feedback and all the con Reports there's always that small percentage of people who bitch about everything.

216
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:11,786
Speaker 0: Yeah Like oh the cosplay was not judged according to these exact rules that I wanted it to be judged by.

217
00:13:11,906 --> 00:13:21,123
Speaker 0: or the elevators were too Small for my bountiful body yes, or this panel ran five minutes short or my panel was.

218
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:27,330
Speaker 0: we had to wait ten minutes before we could go in because The voice actors before us had a crowd around them and they would not disperse.

219
00:13:27,451 --> 00:13:28,395
Speaker 1: I love the people who are.

220
00:13:28,435 --> 00:13:31,410
Speaker 0: I can't get into this panel because I didn't wait in line early enough.

221
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:36,387
Speaker 1: My favorite people are the people who complain about the AMV's over which the con has almost no control.

222
00:13:36,548 --> 00:13:38,703
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, I'm almost no control.

223
00:13:38,723 --> 00:13:44,790
Speaker 0: There's one thing they could do The best from the worst but they if the if the best are still crap, what can they do about it?

224
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,941
Speaker 0: Yeah, not have AMV's more than what would people complain about?

225
00:13:48,102 --> 00:13:50,290
Speaker 1: the people who complain about the freaking weather?

226
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:55,110
Speaker 1: What do you think Otakon is gonna do about the fact that it's hot in Baltimore in August?

227
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, are they gonna move the convention to a different time of year?

228
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:01,701
Speaker 0: Maybe when you're in school and you can't go you punk kids.

229
00:14:01,761 --> 00:14:05,675
Speaker 1: No, we'll just move up to Michigan granted It's still there.

230
00:14:05,936 --> 00:14:08,364
Speaker 0: Oh, so everyone will just complain about it being freezing cold.

231
00:14:08,484 --> 00:14:10,887
Speaker 0: or oh, it's not far away from my house I can't go.

232
00:14:12,202 --> 00:14:12,370
Speaker 0: Yeah.

233
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:21,033
Speaker 0: Anyway, despite the if you'd subtract all the people who complain about any convention no matter what anime expos seem to seems to have had Huge problems.

234
00:14:21,314 --> 00:14:26,030
Speaker 0: that awesome concert we talked that I just talked about was delayed for multiple hours.

235
00:14:26,391 --> 00:14:35,239
Speaker 0: people had to wait in line outside not being able to enjoy any other part of the convention because they had to wait in line for Multiple hours before they could get in to see this concert.

236
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:39,821
Speaker 0: and Some people reviewing the concert said while it was pretty awesome.

237
00:14:39,861 --> 00:14:42,970
Speaker 0: It wasn't super awesome, and it wasn't super long either.

238
00:14:43,071 --> 00:14:45,070
Speaker 0: It was kind of not so long.

239
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,735
Speaker 0: Yeah, you wanted a concert to be.

240
00:14:46,895 --> 00:15:01,287
Speaker 1: meanwhile back at Otakon when Lark came not only did they do a complete full Just straight-up set at a concert like any arena concert and a gigantic encore, but everything happened pretty much right on schedule Yep, but that's kind of comparing apples and oranges.

241
00:15:01,448 --> 00:15:18,830
Speaker 0: Yep but also a lot of other things at this convention were constantly being canceled and delayed and moved around and We're not talking about just one concert It's it seems like the vast majority of the big events were canceled and moved and changed and delayed.

242
00:15:19,111 --> 00:15:23,950
Speaker 1: Not just that but a lot of people complain that almost all the panels got moved around or canceled or delayed.

243
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:29,106
Speaker 0: Yeah, the biggest one at least the one that had the biggest talk going on about it.

244
00:15:29,226 --> 00:15:30,109
Speaker 0: Is there someone named?

245
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:36,670
Speaker 0: Halkomomoe, I don't know if I'm saying it right, but apparently she's like the queen of Akihabara or something like that.

246
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:37,462
Speaker 1: Oh, I forgot

247
00:15:37,482 --> 00:15:55,390
Speaker 0: about that I'm not exactly sure but what the story is is that she was very upset with how you know This is a Japanese guest and she was very upset with how you know her interactions with the convention staff and they basically You know weren't meeting her needs and and she like posted on her blog that she was upset.

248
00:15:55,530 --> 00:16:00,590
Speaker 1: There's something something and then obviously her PR wrangler got a hold of her and told her to retract it.

249
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,075
Speaker 0: Yeah, but and whatever.

250
00:16:02,557 --> 00:16:17,730
Speaker 0: but the thing is is that basically she had to choose on like like one day of the con whether she basically had to decide between having her concert or Doing all her other events instead of just as scheduled doing all her events and her concert.

251
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:26,147
Speaker 0: So she canceled all her appearances For one day of the con and only did the concert and didn't do anything else that she was going to do.

252
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:31,849
Speaker 0: and she was All like apologizing to the fans and being like I will do my best in this concert for you.

253
00:16:32,531 --> 00:16:34,819
Speaker 0: These evil con staff fucked me over.

254
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:35,682
Speaker 0: I hate them.

255
00:16:35,883 --> 00:16:36,886
Speaker 0: people were crying.

256
00:16:36,906 --> 00:16:47,210
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, see it's really hard to say how much of that might be a pampered guest verse I mean, I don't know anything about very hard to tell from a blog post across the world.

257
00:16:47,712 --> 00:16:55,655
Speaker 0: You know if this is a pampered guest who is upset or if con logistics dictor over or a combination or who knows what.

258
00:16:55,916 --> 00:17:09,184
Speaker 1: one thing I find interesting is that I was poking around in the Anime Expo forums and there's a lot of outcry there and people demanding answers and demanding an explanation and all sorts of things and I couldn't find many if Any responses from the staff.

259
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:09,950
Speaker 1: in fact?

260
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:17,612
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of people trying to get together To go over to where the staff is located where their place of business is and knock on the door and try to get an Answer.

261
00:17:18,214 --> 00:17:24,770
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't know if the responses are official somewhere else But I got the impression that the staff was kind of hiding from the con.

262
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:29,310
Speaker 0: I don't know, you know impressions on the internet don't tell us anything.

263
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:32,545
Speaker 0: I have no idea what the reasons were for all these problems.

264
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:33,490
Speaker 0: I don't know who to blame.

265
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,869
Speaker 0: I don't even know any of the staff.

266
00:17:35,392 --> 00:17:36,154
Speaker 0: I don't know anything.

267
00:17:36,234 --> 00:17:40,890
Speaker 0: but I do know is that the con had major problems with a lot of events.

268
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,080
Speaker 0: that is absolutely true.

269
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:53,735
Speaker 0: that is what happened and I thought poorly of Anime Expo before and I still think poorly of them no matter how awesome their programming is and they're Not doing too much to fix that.

270
00:17:54,095 --> 00:18:01,461
Speaker 0: and if someone across the country who's never been to your con and it's someone who likes cons Thinks poorly of your con.

271
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:02,929
Speaker 0: That's pretty poor.

272
00:18:04,311 --> 00:18:07,907
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, I got to say I'm more and more impressed with Katsucon every year.

273
00:18:07,927 --> 00:18:11,719
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah It's fast becoming my second favorite or favorite con.

274
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,210
Speaker 0: Katsucon was very awesome and I only went to one of them.

275
00:18:15,491 --> 00:18:23,402
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've been to three and I will admit though on the second Katsucon I went to I achieved for about six hours epic level drunkenness.

276
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:24,165
Speaker 0: Whoa.

277
00:18:24,345 --> 00:18:25,870
Speaker 1: It was quite an experience.

278
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:28,181
Speaker 0: I think that's Katsucon's thing though.

279
00:18:28,503 --> 00:18:29,910
Speaker 1: It is that's why I like Katsucon.

280
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,937
Speaker 1: There's a lot more people my age.

281
00:18:32,318 --> 00:18:37,317
Speaker 1: I can go to a bar and just chill with a bunch of older anime fans But it's not a hentai con.

282
00:18:37,437 --> 00:18:39,485
Speaker 1: no, it's not like that Rhode Island things gonna be.

283
00:18:39,505 --> 00:18:40,730
Speaker 0: yeah, we'll see about that.

284
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:41,902
Speaker 1: I have high hopes for that.

285
00:18:42,023 --> 00:18:46,740
Speaker 0: I just I My cynicism low expectations, but a lot of hope.

286
00:18:47,081 --> 00:18:50,490
Speaker 0: cynicism greater than optimism exactly at least for that.

287
00:18:57,251 --> 00:18:58,857
Speaker 1: things of the day.

288
00:18:58,877 --> 00:19:03,953
Speaker 0: a long time ago, I had a thing of the day, which was Miotd.com.

289
00:19:04,013 --> 00:19:09,767
Speaker 0: it's a website that is mecha image of the day and every day they have a mecha image and it's.

290
00:19:10,068 --> 00:19:11,151
Speaker 0: it's a really awesome Site.

291
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:14,162
Speaker 0: I subscribe to the RSS feed and it's really good.

292
00:19:14,603 --> 00:19:21,523
Speaker 0: Well, my thing of the day today is a Particular image from the mecha image of the day on July 9th.

293
00:19:21,865 --> 00:19:28,110
Speaker 0: They put up this picture and it's a picture I feel like I've seen before But I'm not sure where I've seen it before it.

294
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:35,409
Speaker 0: I'm sure some nerd out there can tell me but this image is a mashup a really good mashup that looks a lot like.

295
00:19:36,031 --> 00:19:53,990
Speaker 0: Basically it combines like a Hildebrandt brothers Star Wars movie poster with a picture of a bunch of nerds in the front row of a concert and Star Wars and a concert where the Star Wars characters are Making a rock band of themselves and it's if you like Star Wars at all.

296
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:54,935
Speaker 0: This is something to see.

297
00:19:54,996 --> 00:19:57,490
Speaker 0: but my only question is why is this a mecha image of the day?

298
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:02,228
Speaker 0: I mean sure the droids are back there and Darth Vader's there, but it's not a mecha image.

299
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:02,710
Speaker 1: You know what?

300
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:03,594
Speaker 1: I don't think it matters.

301
00:20:03,674 --> 00:20:04,337
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

302
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,326
Speaker 0: Every geek should see this picture.

303
00:20:06,346 --> 00:20:09,541
Speaker 1: That's the three things I will point out about this picture that are awesome.

304
00:20:09,601 --> 00:20:10,124
Speaker 1: Number one.

305
00:20:10,465 --> 00:20:11,530
Speaker 1: Darth Vader is awesome.

306
00:20:11,932 --> 00:20:12,956
Speaker 0: It is always awesome.

307
00:20:13,157 --> 00:20:18,737
Speaker 1: number two Han Solo the way he is Engaging the crowd is awesome.

308
00:20:18,757 --> 00:20:19,559
Speaker 0: He's always awesome.

309
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:23,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, and number three notice the guy in the audience with a lightsaber.

310
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:29,346
Speaker 0: Yep Basically, if you're a geek of any kind, it's just a picture you need to see.

311
00:20:29,446 --> 00:20:30,933
Speaker 0: that's why it's a thing of the day Right.

312
00:20:31,336 --> 00:20:33,390
Speaker 1: So, uh, imagine a Zerg rush.

313
00:20:34,072 --> 00:20:34,393
Speaker 1: Okay.

314
00:20:34,593 --> 00:20:34,854
Speaker 1: All right.

315
00:20:35,115 --> 00:20:43,298
Speaker 1: Now imagine a Zerg rush where the target is not a human or a Terran or whatever, but Some poor kitten.

316
00:20:43,841 --> 00:20:45,570
Speaker 1: that's a pretty scary image, isn't it?

317
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:47,357
Speaker 0: I mean one Zerg can kill a kitten.

318
00:20:47,678 --> 00:20:53,861
Speaker 1: one Zerg could take both of us out from this room Handily, that's why I'm so afraid of real-world Starcraft.

319
00:20:54,262 --> 00:20:58,837
Speaker 0: Yeah, but remember if real-world Starcraft happens We'll have all those Terran equipments watch.

320
00:20:58,897 --> 00:21:00,322
Speaker 1: We don't we're just normal people.

321
00:21:00,362 --> 00:21:01,466
Speaker 1: the Terrans come from space.

322
00:21:01,486 --> 00:21:07,442
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, instead of the zombie apocalypse who's no different than alien?

323
00:21:07,923 --> 00:21:09,830
Speaker 1: no, yeah, you know what that would also kill us?

324
00:21:10,112 --> 00:21:11,019
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

325
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:16,681
Speaker 0: I think I could take alien cuz I've As long as I had those equipments, you know, as long as you don't.

326
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:19,110
Speaker 0: yeah, I played enough natural selection.

327
00:21:20,272 --> 00:21:23,090
Speaker 1: The problem is we don't have those machine guns that have a billion bullets.

328
00:21:23,672 --> 00:21:24,214
Speaker 0: That's what we.

329
00:21:24,334 --> 00:21:25,538
Speaker 0: if there's aliens we'll have those.

330
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,542
Speaker 0: that's how it works.

331
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:37,509
Speaker 1: All right, so now take you have flamethrowers I've just given you but replace the Zerg with eight an enormous number of Corgi puppies and it is one much safer.

332
00:21:38,771 --> 00:21:39,955
Speaker 1: They're much easier to take out.

333
00:21:39,995 --> 00:21:43,749
Speaker 1: but I got to say this is one of the most adorable things I've ever seen.

334
00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:45,635
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was all right.

335
00:21:46,057 --> 00:21:48,927
Speaker 0: The thing I don't like the problem is they don't zerg rush enough.

336
00:21:49,127 --> 00:21:52,526
Speaker 1: It's just yeah It devolves into just puppies playing and then puppies sleeping.

337
00:21:52,566 --> 00:21:57,890
Speaker 1: you can skip all that But the first bit you might think that's just like two or three puppies and that cat just looks mildly annoyed.

338
00:21:58,232 --> 00:22:01,890
Speaker 1: Just wait for it and watch until the cat gets away and you don't really need to watch the rest.

339
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,456
Speaker 0: But not the best animal video.

340
00:22:03,496 --> 00:22:05,764
Speaker 0: not as good as turtle attacking cat, but I don't know.

341
00:22:05,804 --> 00:22:06,286
Speaker 1: I like.

342
00:22:06,386 --> 00:22:09,138
Speaker 1: I like this more than turtle But that's just because you like turtles more than me.

343
00:22:09,259 --> 00:22:11,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not so not as good as rabbit attack snake.

344
00:22:12,051 --> 00:22:14,920
Speaker 1: No, it's not because that is still the baddest ass rabbit ever.

345
00:22:14,941 --> 00:22:19,123
Speaker 1: Yeah, like a rabbit that lives in a lion's den Why do you like that turtle?

346
00:22:19,184 --> 00:22:21,960
Speaker 1: It's not you I don't like to do.

347
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,889
Speaker 1: Oh random cute animal.

348
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:28,249
Speaker 1: But this one was particularly cute and the fact that they called it a zerg rush meant that I had to talk about it.

349
00:22:30,118 --> 00:22:31,350
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's con season.

350
00:22:31,453 --> 00:22:39,891
Speaker 1: like we said we're not gonna rest until The Monday after Otakon and then none of you are going to hear a peep out of us until the Monday after the Monday after Otakon,

351
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:46,890
Speaker 0: so we're gonna spend this episode telling you what cons we're going to here and what we're doing at those cons.

352
00:22:47,451 --> 00:22:50,179
Speaker 1: I guess we'll go in chronological order sounds good to me.

353
00:22:50,520 --> 00:23:01,432
Speaker 0: So this weekend this weekend as in July 13 14 15 we are going to be at Connecticut 2007.

354
00:23:01,432 --> 00:23:04,101
Speaker 1: Connecticut is located at the what Hartford Convention Center.

355
00:23:04,322 --> 00:23:06,770
Speaker 0: I think that's if it didn't move willing to the website.

356
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,049
Speaker 1: I'm sure you can find it.

357
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:15,399
Speaker 0: I've got a convention center on Columbus Boulevard in Hartford, Connecticut on July 13 through 15th 2007. now

358
00:23:15,601 --> 00:23:30,323
Speaker 1: we are going to be there Friday But we're pretty much going to have a few drinks with friends and go to bed The reason being that over the course of Saturday we are doing six live shows and then on Sunday We are doing a seventh and that is the minimum that we will be doing at this con.

359
00:23:30,343 --> 00:23:32,009
Speaker 1: There's probably going to be more.

360
00:23:33,851 --> 00:23:45,073
Speaker 1: Yeah, this will be a big test of our voices because for those of you who saw us at Otakon last year by Sunday We had lost our voices to the point that we had to medicate and I point out that Scott doesn't fucking take Medicine ever.

361
00:23:45,273 --> 00:23:52,010
Speaker 1: well halls doesn't really count so much as we took the mentholated halls and we took far more than a doctor would have Led us probably.

362
00:23:52,592 --> 00:23:56,625
Speaker 1: Yeah, we had to drug ourselves to be able to do the let the panel on Sunday.

363
00:23:56,685 --> 00:24:00,048
Speaker 1: We had lost our voices so badly Yeah, and now we're doing seven.

364
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,324
Speaker 0: Okay, so which seven are we doing?

365
00:24:03,344 --> 00:24:04,350
Speaker 0: Let's open up the cons kid.

366
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:12,869
Speaker 1: well mostly pretty much all day Saturday if you want to have a geek nights event, we're either gonna be in a panel or Outside of a panel preparing for another panel.

367
00:24:13,471 --> 00:24:18,410
Speaker 1: We're doing a podcasting and internet radio on Saturday from 12 30 to 1 30 in panel 2.

368
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:18,873
Speaker 1: I don't we need to.

369
00:24:18,893 --> 00:24:19,960
Speaker 1: we don't need to say where they all are.

370
00:24:19,981 --> 00:24:21,028
Speaker 0: No, we don't need to say where they all.

371
00:24:21,068 --> 00:24:22,275
Speaker 0: you'll see The con schedule.

372
00:24:22,376 --> 00:24:24,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, suffice to say we've done this panel like three or four times.

373
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:27,960
Speaker 1: There are in fact two or three examples of it in the feed already.

374
00:24:28,542 --> 00:24:30,690
Speaker 1: We're doing it partly because they were interested in it.

375
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:38,470
Speaker 1: They haven't had anything like that before at Connecticut And I think Connecticut's probably a good match for it because there's probably a lot of people there who are really interested in podcasting.

376
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:39,354
Speaker 1: I don't know a lot about it.

377
00:24:39,736 --> 00:24:39,917
Speaker 0: Yep.

378
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:48,250
Speaker 1: Oh, we're doing the how to run an anime club right before that Yep Which we have run along with our friend Scott Johnson the legendary Scott Johnson as featured in new type.

379
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:58,110
Speaker 1: We've been running this for like five or six years that pretty much every freaking con Yep, so if you want to know how to run an anime con or not an anime con anime club We run this everywhere.

380
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:02,833
Speaker 1: It's mostly for people who haven't seen this panel already Yep.

381
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:12,410
Speaker 0: All right after the podcasting internet radio panel that we're doing An hour and a half after that or so, we're gonna do the anime match game for two hours.

382
00:25:12,631 --> 00:25:16,725
Speaker 0: It's gonna be like the deluxe anime match game of super awesome at all time.

383
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:21,002
Speaker 1: Not only is this gonna be awesome Not only did I write twice as many questions.

384
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:29,270
Speaker 1: Not only did I get rid of the crappy questions Not only did we add so much to this, but we have got a lineup of celebrity guests from the con.

385
00:25:29,691 --> 00:25:32,942
Speaker 0: Yep, yes, whoever is the best guess at the con is who we're gonna get.

386
00:25:33,183 --> 00:25:34,046
Speaker 1: so we're not gonna.

387
00:25:34,086 --> 00:25:35,796
Speaker 1: it's not gonna be the usual Alright.

388
00:25:35,816 --> 00:25:41,563
Speaker 1: so Scott's on the panel along with Dave and Joel and whoever we could drag up five minutes before the con.

389
00:25:41,724 --> 00:25:43,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is gonna be some awesome guests.

390
00:25:43,378 --> 00:25:50,535
Speaker 0: Yeah These are gonna be like guests of honor at the con or official guests of the con are gonna make up our panel at the match Game worst case.

391
00:25:50,636 --> 00:25:53,750
Speaker 1: it's gonna be a bunch of cool webcomic artists, which is always hilarious.

392
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:58,126
Speaker 1: Yes, so Scott Scott and I will probably take turns sitting as these six panelists.

393
00:25:58,146 --> 00:25:59,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we always seem to do.

394
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,376
Speaker 1: That's always hilarious.

395
00:26:00,417 --> 00:26:02,689
Speaker 0: Yes, but this will be something you do not want to miss.

396
00:26:03,171 --> 00:26:08,850
Speaker 0: In fact looking at the schedule like it completely dominates everything running concurrent with it.

397
00:26:09,033 --> 00:26:20,328
Speaker 1: So yeah plus we've run this a lot over the years and I think this is going to be the best one because we have prepared more for this anime match game than we have for enemy Any anime match game we have ever run?

398
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:24,082
Speaker 1: Partly because we're not running it at Otacon like we'd are offered to.

399
00:26:24,423 --> 00:26:26,350
Speaker 1: so we're gonna use all the Otacon awesome here.

400
00:26:26,671 --> 00:26:26,872
Speaker 0: Yep.

401
00:26:27,674 --> 00:26:29,159
Speaker 0: All right shortly after that.

402
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,270
Speaker 0: We're gonna do the challenger on fire beta test.

403
00:26:32,511 --> 00:26:35,204
Speaker 1: Yes, I noticed this is also in the big panel room.

404
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:36,550
Speaker 1: So this should be awesome.

405
00:26:36,931 --> 00:26:39,201
Speaker 1: We're not sure how this is gonna work and I haven't finished it yet.

406
00:26:39,884 --> 00:26:46,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically challenger on fire It was the thing of the day a long time ago some Japanese game show where you have to name a hundred anime characters.

407
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:59,038
Speaker 0: Well, we wrote a piece of software there so that we are would be able to run this game in some in the best fashion we can without our own custom studio and We're gonna try to run this game.

408
00:26:59,058 --> 00:27:00,284
Speaker 0: This is gonna be a beta test though.

409
00:27:00,304 --> 00:27:01,350
Speaker 0: We've never done this before.

410
00:27:01,632 --> 00:27:02,740
Speaker 0: We don't know how it's gonna work.

411
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,170
Speaker 0: We don't know how to run it smoothly.

412
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:07,126
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're basically gonna practice running it to see.

413
00:27:07,549 --> 00:27:10,850
Speaker 0: you know Try to figure out how to make it work at other cons in the future.

414
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:19,190
Speaker 0: So if you want to be a part of a first ever con event that will possibly become a very popular con event in the future.

415
00:27:20,191 --> 00:27:21,316
Speaker 0: This is something you don't want to miss.

416
00:27:21,597 --> 00:27:21,778
Speaker 1: Yep.

417
00:27:21,818 --> 00:27:26,410
Speaker 1: Kinetic con has been very gracious in allowing us to test this So I'm really looking forward to it.

418
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:37,304
Speaker 1: I think we're gonna get a lot of good feedback and it'll be fun because think of this Either we're gonna run it awesomely and you'll all love it or We're gonna totally fuck up and you'll get to laugh at us for an hour straight.

419
00:27:37,565 --> 00:27:37,785
Speaker 1: Yep.

420
00:27:38,167 --> 00:27:39,170
Speaker 0: I'm glad it's only an hour.

421
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:42,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, cuz I don't know how many of these I'm gonna finish by then.

422
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:43,734
Speaker 1: I got a lot of work to do still.

423
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:47,870
Speaker 1: Yep, partly because of my odd emergency room adventure over the weekend.

424
00:27:48,411 --> 00:27:50,397
Speaker 1: Anyway, then later on that night.

425
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:55,572
Speaker 1: We don't have all the details yet, but we're going to be running guest interviews Ourselves.

426
00:27:55,592 --> 00:28:01,220
Speaker 1: so there's gonna be guests of the con who normally when a con guest has a panel They just kind of sit there and wing it.

427
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,190
Speaker 1: or maybe they have someone from the con try to guide him.

428
00:28:03,652 --> 00:28:05,680
Speaker 0: Well, we're gonna do or they have people from the audience.

429
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,230
Speaker 0: That's the same dumbass questions over and over what we're gonna.

430
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,940
Speaker 0: How did you become a voice actor?

431
00:28:10,161 --> 00:28:11,207
Speaker 0: How do I become a voice?

432
00:28:11,267 --> 00:28:12,751
Speaker 1: What's your Inspiration?

433
00:28:12,811 --> 00:28:16,222
Speaker 1: probably the crappest question you can ever ask anyone at a con ever.

434
00:28:16,442 --> 00:28:18,429
Speaker 0: What's the favorite thing you've ever worked on?

435
00:28:18,449 --> 00:28:20,338
Speaker 0: Yep What are you working on now?

436
00:28:20,358 --> 00:28:20,378
Speaker 0: I?

437
00:28:22,871 --> 00:28:26,307
Speaker 1: Like to see the weird question, I like to see the questions where the guy goes what.

438
00:28:26,849 --> 00:28:28,054
Speaker 0: yeah Those are my kind of quest.

439
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:28,315
Speaker 0: Yes.

440
00:28:28,435 --> 00:28:31,949
Speaker 1: But anyway, we are going to be setting up and it's not our panel.

441
00:28:31,989 --> 00:28:32,950
Speaker 1: Really We're just the moderators.

442
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:44,310
Speaker 1: we're going to be interviewing some of the guests of the con in front of everyone and Probably recording these for posterity and hopefully our goal is that we can guide these interviews into being awesome.

443
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:46,122
Speaker 1: We want to bring out the shine of these guests.

444
00:28:46,142 --> 00:28:54,217
Speaker 0: This is not a panel for us So imagine if you listened to like an episode of geek nights where we had a celebrity guest like the and we interviewed Them all awesomely right now.

445
00:28:54,277 --> 00:28:57,350
Speaker 0: This panel is basically gonna be that only live and in person.

446
00:28:57,892 --> 00:29:03,590
Speaker 0: So if you like listening to an episode of geek nights where we cleverly and awesomely interview a celebrity guest

447
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:07,383
Speaker 1: I'd like to point out particularly the Luke Crane interview creator of burning wheel

448
00:29:07,423 --> 00:29:12,910
Speaker 0: because they haven't done too many interviews even though I got really good at them all of a sudden while interviewing Luke Craig.

449
00:29:12,974 --> 00:29:19,030
Speaker 1: Yes It was really amazing because Scott had never really interviewed someone like that before and he went from suck to awesome in about two questions.

450
00:29:19,413 --> 00:29:26,646
Speaker 1: And the rest of that thing is Scott did a really freaking good job And I really I've listened to that episode twice twice because I enjoy it.

451
00:29:26,927 --> 00:29:27,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a good episode.

452
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:34,730
Speaker 1: It's also because I was actually pretty drunk while you guys were doing the interview So I was pretty much just sitting there watching the levels the whole time.

453
00:29:35,253 --> 00:29:38,914
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not saying but if you want to hear some of that kind of awesome This is a panel to go to.

454
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:48,407
Speaker 1: so after that kind of late night also on Saturday We are running the beta version of gecky guy putting the man back in manga.

455
00:29:48,427 --> 00:29:52,109
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah We've been thinking about doing this panel for a long time.

456
00:29:53,531 --> 00:29:56,101
Speaker 0: It's an actually what probably our only panel.

457
00:29:56,121 --> 00:29:58,330
Speaker 0: that's actually an anime manga panel.

458
00:29:58,491 --> 00:30:07,977
Speaker 1: Yes, and I will point out we'll talk about this in a bit But this is our prime time event at Otakon and we're running it at Otakon with None other than Gerald from anime world order

459
00:30:08,018 --> 00:30:08,980
Speaker 0: Gerald Rathcole

460
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:15,350
Speaker 1: who assures us that while we're gonna coordinate the whole panel He has something special lined up for the last 10 minutes.

461
00:30:15,812 --> 00:30:18,830
Speaker 1: Oh, man, and he's hinted at what it is, but I'm really looking forward to it.

462
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:24,130
Speaker 1: I think I know what it is, but oh man, so at Kinetic on it's not gonna be that exact thing.

463
00:30:24,231 --> 00:30:25,058
Speaker 1: We're not gonna have Gerald.

464
00:30:25,118 --> 00:30:27,073
Speaker 1: I don't think he wants to fly up for this But I don't.

465
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:29,328
Speaker 0: yeah, he's not gonna come from Florida to Kinetic on.

466
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:33,822
Speaker 1: Basically, if you've listened to our show at that rink eating long enough.

467
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:34,806
Speaker 1: I like Kinetic on.

468
00:30:34,826 --> 00:30:36,833
Speaker 1: it's actually bigger than you'd think Yeah, but it's not.

469
00:30:36,993 --> 00:30:40,104
Speaker 0: it's it's too small to be worth coming from Florida for.

470
00:30:40,525 --> 00:30:46,330
Speaker 1: yeah, I'm not gonna lie to you But anyway, what we're gonna be doing is kind of our half of this panel.

471
00:30:46,652 --> 00:30:49,970
Speaker 1: We're not gonna do the kind of 18 plus super crazy humor.

472
00:30:50,030 --> 00:31:02,970
Speaker 1: We're gonna do just more of a half history of manga half what this geeky guy is and more importantly We're just gonna talk about all those Genres of manga and all those manga that are out there that you probably haven't read that are probably really up your alley.

473
00:31:03,432 --> 00:31:12,590
Speaker 1: A lot of people maybe not you because you listen to our show and anime world order and you know all about this But there's a lot of people who don't realize that there's manga other than pretty boys and pretty girls and show Joe.

474
00:31:12,731 --> 00:31:16,635
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean you go to the bookstore and Basically what happened in the u.s.

475
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:25,270
Speaker 0: And manga I just knew this really quickly is This is I'm gonna probably say the same stuff again at the at the actual panel is that they originally brought manga to the u.s.

476
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:35,743
Speaker 0: you know you know all the crazy violent stuff the stuff that went along with the anime and Viz did it actually first and Dark Horse soon after and Most of it was ignored.

477
00:31:35,763 --> 00:31:36,830
Speaker 0: It didn't sell very well.

478
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:40,970
Speaker 0: It sold to the comic crowd a bit and it didn't make a big splash.

479
00:31:41,454 --> 00:31:46,597
Speaker 0: So they only kind of kept doing it you know at a very slow pace and in the comic book in the u.s.

480
00:31:46,637 --> 00:31:55,590
Speaker 0: comic book format and such and Then someone decided they're gonna bring over some show Joe in the digest format namely Tokyo pop and as you know it exploded.

481
00:31:56,094 --> 00:32:05,215
Speaker 0: The thing is people realizing that hey We can make a lot of money by bringing show Joey and shown and jump type stuff shown in fighting stuff Over to the u.s.

482
00:32:05,395 --> 00:32:07,864
Speaker 0: In this format and make a lot of money off of it.

483
00:32:07,924 --> 00:32:09,650
Speaker 0: and there's so much stuff in that format.

484
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:16,530
Speaker 0: They don't even bother to bring over anything else unless you know Because they can make plenty of money with just bringing over the same old stuff.

485
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:23,579
Speaker 0: The end result of this is they'll go to the manga section of the bookstore and they think that manga is Girly-girly and shown in fighting and nothing else.

486
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:23,840
Speaker 1: Yep.

487
00:32:24,081 --> 00:32:36,364
Speaker 1: The true end result is that awesome manga I forget the name of it But Emily told me about it is by the same guy who did eagle and there's some natural disaster that splits Japan in two And it's nothing but politicians and Yakuza arguing and looking dramatic.

488
00:32:36,765 --> 00:32:38,030
Speaker 1: That's so up my alley.

489
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:38,713
Speaker 1: I could cry.

490
00:32:38,974 --> 00:32:51,572
Speaker 1: the fact that that kind of manga almost never gets released over here is Probably one of the biggest tragedies of the manga industry in the u.s Yes, so we are going to tell you about as many of the manga or you know We're.

491
00:32:51,734 --> 00:32:55,470
Speaker 0: I think we'll go in depth on a few of them But maybe we'll probably mention a whole bunch of others.

492
00:32:55,490 --> 00:33:01,132
Speaker 1: We're gonna talk a lot about the history of manga and Tezuka and where the term gecky guy kind of came from and all that Stuff.

493
00:33:01,192 --> 00:33:08,829
Speaker 0: Yeah, you probably heard at an anime world order if you listen to them This panel isn't so well isn't for people who listen to podcasts for people at the con who you know.

494
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,595
Speaker 0: Yeah, I put the man back in their manga.

495
00:33:10,776 --> 00:33:14,066
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz basically the man back in their manga.

496
00:33:14,247 --> 00:33:15,290
Speaker 0: the read manga.

497
00:33:16,311 --> 00:33:24,809
Speaker 1: Part of the reason we named it what we did is for the ironic tongue-in-cheek Nature of because we expect a lot of people to come in expecting something very different from what we're going to do.

498
00:33:25,191 --> 00:33:32,310
Speaker 1: Yep, however, I will note that at Otakon they're going to get half of what we're going to do now and half Exactly what they expected.

499
00:33:33,613 --> 00:33:41,369
Speaker 0: But that's why that's gonna be 18 plus and that is why this Saturday at kinetic on is gonna be crazy because we're doing all that in one day.

500
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:42,012
Speaker 0: We're going.

501
00:33:42,032 --> 00:33:44,941
Speaker 1: we're doing 12 solid hours of entertainment.

502
00:33:45,342 --> 00:33:46,245
Speaker 1: Wow from 1230 p.m.

503
00:33:46,285 --> 00:33:47,851
Speaker 1: Until 1130 p.m

504
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:50,113
Speaker 0: Wow,

505
00:33:50,434 --> 00:34:06,966
Speaker 1: and then if we survive because remember the one cool thing about kinetic on are the awesome after parties and I might have to not go to them even though I know of some really cool ones, but Anyway, if we survive Sunday morning, we're running a panel on German board gaming.

506
00:34:06,986 --> 00:34:09,233
Speaker 0: Yep, basically the panel We're just gonna.

507
00:34:09,253 --> 00:34:09,835
Speaker 0: we're gonna?

508
00:34:10,177 --> 00:34:10,658
Speaker 1: no we're not.

509
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:11,159
Speaker 1: No, we're not.

510
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:14,713
Speaker 1: we're gonna croak miserably into microphones Cry.

511
00:34:15,013 --> 00:34:25,341
Speaker 0: we're gonna attempt to tell people who don't know anything about German board games and if only played Monopoly and such About the wonderful world of you know, Euro board gaming.

512
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:30,150
Speaker 0: and it just so happens that kinetic on has an excellent gaming room But you can go and play these games.

513
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:39,670
Speaker 0: So hopefully we'll be able to convince a whole bunch of people who don't who say German board game That sounds interesting and then we'll be able to convince them to go and play them right after the panel.

514
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:42,926
Speaker 1: Kinetic on has better gaming content than a lot of gaming cons.

515
00:34:43,045 --> 00:34:43,730
Speaker 0: It sure does.

516
00:34:43,911 --> 00:34:54,821
Speaker 1: In fact, I'd go so far as to say kinetic on is half gaming con And I'm probably gonna give away a board game or two because I happen to have a few board games laying around that are either Unopened even though they're awesome because I already own them.

517
00:34:54,841 --> 00:34:56,487
Speaker 0: or that you don't want or that I don't want.

518
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:58,755
Speaker 1: Yep I'll make it very clear which is which.

519
00:34:59,036 --> 00:35:03,430
Speaker 1: yeah, so thus kinetic on this weekend is going to be awesome.

520
00:35:03,551 --> 00:35:04,888
Speaker 1: If you were fans of us, yep.

521
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:12,046
Speaker 1: However, if you want to hang out with us I will warn you that we will probably not have time to say hi at kinetic on.

522
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,290
Speaker 0: no, probably not.

523
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:18,170
Speaker 0: I mean maybe Friday night depending on when we get there, which I imagine might be 9 10 ish something like that.

524
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:22,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, give or take we're probably gonna show out of bed get our badges and go straight to freakin sleep.

525
00:35:22,991 --> 00:35:28,321
Speaker 0: Yep, and Sunday after the German board gaming panel, you know I don't know how long we're gonna hang around.

526
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:29,730
Speaker 0: We'll see what our plans are.

527
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:35,030
Speaker 1: Yes, because you realize that pretty much right after kinetic on we have not a single moment of rest.

528
00:35:35,372 --> 00:35:37,890
Speaker 1: And then we're gonna be at Otacon ready to run.

529
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:42,423
Speaker 0: Basically three days of work after kinetic on is over and then leave.

530
00:35:42,443 --> 00:35:43,486
Speaker 0: don't go to Otacon BAM.

531
00:35:43,887 --> 00:35:44,770
Speaker 0: It's gonna be that crazy.

532
00:35:45,156 --> 00:35:53,031
Speaker 1: so, uh Otacon I'm not gonna get into the issues that they had with panels But partly due to the fact that we're friends with a few people on the staff Yes,

533
00:35:53,071 --> 00:36:03,250
Speaker 0: we'll see how this turns out and I'm tell I guarantee you despite our favor for Otacon and our enjoyment of it We will not be dishonest in our reporting if things go poorly.

534
00:36:03,571 --> 00:36:10,970
Speaker 1: However, we did despite the snafu of panels managed to secure four panels at Otacon as well as an artist alley table.

535
00:36:11,433 --> 00:36:17,889
Speaker 1: Now one of them is gonna be with all the other Podcasters because I submitted it and they apparently also wanted to submit it.

536
00:36:18,151 --> 00:36:20,810
Speaker 1: So I basically rolled them both into one and then handed it back over to them.

537
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,059
Speaker 1: But it's no big deal.

538
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,410
Speaker 1: It's gonna be all our friend podcasters.

539
00:36:23,511 --> 00:36:26,389
Speaker 1: We're gonna sit around and shoot the shit in front of a crowd for a while.

540
00:36:26,973 --> 00:36:29,366
Speaker 0: Yeah, that'll probably be an off-the-cuff kind of panel.

541
00:36:29,466 --> 00:36:30,090
Speaker 0: be a lot of fun.

542
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:34,162
Speaker 0: You know, if you like anime podcasters, there will be a lot of anime podcasters.

543
00:36:34,202 --> 00:36:36,770
Speaker 0: They're talking about anime podcasting.

544
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:39,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, possibly other anime manga topics.

545
00:36:39,451 --> 00:36:42,663
Speaker 1: We did this almost exact panel at sitcom and I recorded it.

546
00:36:42,964 --> 00:36:48,490
Speaker 1: the recording was unusable But now we have the Mirand so we're probably gonna get an awesome recording of it.

547
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,161
Speaker 0: Yep, so this will.

548
00:36:50,322 --> 00:36:55,389
Speaker 0: even if you don't show up at Otacon You'll probably still be able to hear that panel on the internets in someone's feed.

549
00:36:55,489 --> 00:36:57,174
Speaker 0: Yep Maybe not ours, but someone's now.

550
00:36:57,214 --> 00:37:04,708
Speaker 1: the second panel that we are responsible for but we are not actually running is a panel entitled kendo exclamation point.

551
00:37:05,271 --> 00:37:09,204
Speaker 1: Basically, our friend katsunori Matsushita is a yondan.

552
00:37:09,244 --> 00:37:10,187
Speaker 1: I believe a yondan.

553
00:37:10,387 --> 00:37:12,755
Speaker 1: I don't know how to say Alright, let me put it this way.

554
00:37:12,775 --> 00:37:16,466
Speaker 1: He is a badass motherfucker when it comes to kendo.

555
00:37:16,486 --> 00:37:17,690
Speaker 1: He's a certified instructor.

556
00:37:18,031 --> 00:37:20,482
Speaker 1: He was the friend the kendo club at RIT.

557
00:37:20,502 --> 00:37:22,389
Speaker 1: He trains in kendo.

558
00:37:23,172 --> 00:37:30,349
Speaker 1: Last year there were some kids playing with bokuto and shinai outside of Otacon and they were trying to spar with each other And it was kind of dangerous.

559
00:37:30,871 --> 00:37:33,679
Speaker 1: so katsu walks over and says can I spar?

560
00:37:33,699 --> 00:37:36,755
Speaker 1: and the guy says sure you ever done this before?

561
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:42,622
Speaker 1: and katsu says once or twice and I'll find the pictures whenever I get a chance to post him up.

562
00:37:42,682 --> 00:37:44,410
Speaker 0: We got to get a video the next time.

563
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:46,087
Speaker 1: There are two frames of interest.

564
00:37:46,168 --> 00:37:50,482
Speaker 1: frame Number one is katsu standing there and the other guy looking very aggressive trying to hit katsu.

565
00:37:51,003 --> 00:37:58,966
Speaker 1: The second frame is a shinai one Nanometer away from this guy's eyeball and the guy screaming like a girl and falling over.

566
00:37:59,447 --> 00:38:00,350
Speaker 0: katsu didn't even hit him.

567
00:38:00,851 --> 00:38:05,987
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like it's really awesome when you see him swing the stake because it's like the other guys.

568
00:38:06,047 --> 00:38:14,209
Speaker 0: they sort of you know They don't know how to really sword fight or kendo or anything, you know They they just kind of you know feel like they're mimicking movies or whatever.

569
00:38:14,651 --> 00:38:23,463
Speaker 0: And katsu just swings the stick really hard and really fast and he moves right in on you Like wicked fast like he's standing there and the next second.

570
00:38:23,523 --> 00:38:25,510
Speaker 0: He's like swung the stick five times in your face.

571
00:38:25,812 --> 00:38:28,029
Speaker 1: We have both tried to fight with katsu and it doesn't end.

572
00:38:28,049 --> 00:38:33,912
Speaker 0: well Yes, but standing off to the side and watching it there is not much that is as amusing I believe.

573
00:38:33,953 --> 00:38:34,534
Speaker 1: the question.

574
00:38:34,555 --> 00:38:38,689
Speaker 1: the guy that he owned asked afterward and I quote what is he?

575
00:38:40,703 --> 00:38:46,703
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, so so if you want to learn about kendo a relative I mean, he's not the kendo master of the world.

576
00:38:46,844 --> 00:38:54,730
Speaker 0: his dad is yeah But he's effectively a kendo master of some level far beyond the vast majority of kendo people in the world.

577
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,499
Speaker 1: So he's gonna talk about the history of kendo.

578
00:38:56,539 --> 00:38:58,790
Speaker 1: He's gonna talk about the techniques and all that and the schools.

579
00:38:59,071 --> 00:39:07,590
Speaker 1: He's probably gonna demonstrate a bunch of training and a bunch of moves and most importantly Safety because a lot of kids hurt themselves with their stupid swords that they don't know how to use at the con.

580
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,918
Speaker 0: Yes, and it's gonna show you how to be less stupid.

581
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:16,770
Speaker 1: if the con will allow it at the end of the panel There's a good chance that katsu and I will end a long-running feud.

582
00:39:17,151 --> 00:39:22,106
Speaker 1: The longest story short is that katsu was the president and ruler of the RIT kendo club.

583
00:39:22,146 --> 00:39:24,692
Speaker 1: that we all found it a bunch of Us not me.

584
00:39:25,053 --> 00:39:31,023
Speaker 1: Yeah, not not Scott but a bunch of the rest of us in some political subterfuge at the at RIT.

585
00:39:31,063 --> 00:39:38,550
Speaker 1: I Awesome because I felt a lot like sayonji and all that business from utana.

586
00:39:39,371 --> 00:39:44,070
Speaker 1: It was an honorary position that technically was supposed to go to the most skilled person in kendo.

587
00:39:44,454 --> 00:39:45,650
Speaker 1: So the president was elected.

588
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:48,885
Speaker 0: You know the person who ran the president and the vice president be the same person.

589
00:39:49,307 --> 00:39:52,090
Speaker 1: if that were the case Then the vice president be the second best person.

590
00:39:52,230 --> 00:40:05,349
Speaker 1: Okay, but due to the fact that I founded the club along with all of them for a good year I was the vice president because the rule was you have to challenge the vice president and I never showed up to the kendo club practices.

591
00:40:06,931 --> 00:40:16,610
Speaker 1: so, uh, that was a dishonor that has been lingering for a long time and Katsu a long time ago challenged me for the title and I have yet to fight him.

592
00:40:16,811 --> 00:40:25,250
Speaker 1: So if the con will let us and if they won't we'll probably do not some sort of liability insurance action Yeah But if they won't we'll probably do it at some point in our travels.

593
00:40:25,712 --> 00:40:28,482
Speaker 1: Katsu and I will have a short sparring match to demonstrate.

594
00:40:28,522 --> 00:40:33,316
Speaker 0: basically rim will hold the stick up in the air Drop the stick and run away.

595
00:40:33,336 --> 00:40:35,202
Speaker 1: I can't run faster than him.

596
00:40:35,243 --> 00:40:36,286
Speaker 1: That's my only power.

597
00:40:36,327 --> 00:40:37,230
Speaker 1: It's my secret attack.

598
00:40:37,431 --> 00:40:39,802
Speaker 0: Well, you can run fast to them as long as you turn around.

599
00:40:40,144 --> 00:40:41,892
Speaker 0: if you're sort of standing there He can like.

600
00:40:42,233 --> 00:40:43,537
Speaker 0: he shuffles really quick.

601
00:40:43,577 --> 00:40:44,781
Speaker 0: That's like the sword shuffle.

602
00:40:44,922 --> 00:40:58,724
Speaker 0: It's kind of surprising like you blink and he's right there Yeah, but like actually running like, you know in a marathon not so much but standing flat-footed and then suddenly being like 10 feet Forward like like snap you're 10 feet forward.

603
00:40:59,026 --> 00:41:01,415
Speaker 0: It's like whoa, it's like Pretty cool.

604
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:03,430
Speaker 1: So then we're not running it.

605
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:09,410
Speaker 1: But again, this is one that I've spoken on pretty much every Otakon I've ever been to is the how to run an anime club.

606
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:16,890
Speaker 1: we're usually Scott sits in the front of the room and Corrects people who make mistakes and answers questions kind of willy-nilly and I said I'll probably just sit there going?

607
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,760
Speaker 0: Ah, I won't even be there.

608
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,530
Speaker 0: who might sit at the artists alley you are?

609
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:24,590
Speaker 1: You should probably go because I really want to send our reporters out to report on all the other panels.

610
00:41:24,751 --> 00:41:31,197
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I we need some ammo for our proposal a modest proposal to Otakon But it's usually a good.

611
00:41:31,258 --> 00:41:35,390
Speaker 0: I really don't want to go to a lot of those panels though We need to send other people to get report.

612
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:44,709
Speaker 1: I know I mostly want to spend my time like I usually do in the live-action video room Yep, but our friend Scott Johnson runs this every year and it's usually a pretty good panel.

613
00:41:45,992 --> 00:41:49,569
Speaker 1: It wasn't great last year, but there were issues and I think it'll be a lot better this year.

614
00:41:50,213 --> 00:41:57,686
Speaker 0: Yep, so if you care about running anime clubs This is pretty much the premier how to run an anime club panel ever so you should go to it now.

615
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:59,833
Speaker 1: last and most Awesome.

616
00:42:00,315 --> 00:42:03,810
Speaker 1: We are running gecky guy putting the man back in manga.

617
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:08,170
Speaker 0: All right, we talked about this already cuz we're running at Kinetic on but we are running it at Otakon.

618
00:42:08,371 --> 00:42:15,927
Speaker 1: We are running it at Otakon as far as I can see on Friday night from like midnight to 1 in the middle of the panels and it's gonna be 18 plus.

619
00:42:17,254 --> 00:42:19,151
Speaker 0: Oh man, sorry for you under 18.

620
00:42:19,151 --> 00:42:26,815
Speaker 1: Yes This is gonna be one of those because we realized that at Otakon the 18 plus primetime panels are Standing room.

621
00:42:26,936 --> 00:42:28,447
Speaker 1: only hundreds of people turned away.

622
00:42:28,689 --> 00:42:33,309
Speaker 1: Yep So we kind of wanted this panel to be 18 plus even though it didn't really need to be.

623
00:42:33,691 --> 00:42:36,564
Speaker 0: However, we could have easily made it not 18 plus.

624
00:42:36,725 --> 00:42:37,750
Speaker 0: we're doing that at Kinetic on.

625
00:42:38,131 --> 00:42:41,783
Speaker 1: However, the fact that Gerald from anime world order is involved.

626
00:42:41,843 --> 00:42:43,970
Speaker 1: I think by Fiat makes it 18 plus.

627
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:50,487
Speaker 0: Also the fact that you know be by making it 18 plus be intent, you know, but we didn't have to.

628
00:42:50,909 --> 00:43:01,604
Speaker 0: we just Intentionally put some 18 plus stuff in there Which I think will not diminish the content of the panel because we will keep that content there But we will add extra content.

629
00:43:01,644 --> 00:43:03,192
Speaker 0: That will be Humorous.

630
00:43:03,573 --> 00:43:07,004
Speaker 1: in fact, I'm gonna let you all in on a secret because our audience is not you.

631
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,582
Speaker 1: our audience is people who don't know About this stuff.

632
00:43:09,907 --> 00:43:23,090
Speaker 0: Yes most of the I gotta be honest a lot of the reason we're running so many panels at cons is To tell everyone who comes to our panels and enjoys it They should fucking listen to geek nights because it's just like coming to our panels every day four times a week.

633
00:43:23,512 --> 00:43:32,190
Speaker 0: So we're gonna pull an Ava and if they're willing to pay money to go to a con to listen to our panel Then they'll sure as hell download a free mp3 four times a week to listen to our panel.

634
00:43:32,511 --> 00:43:36,150
Speaker 1: What we're gonna do is pull the bait and switch the panel.

635
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:39,730
Speaker 1: Look, it's gonna be 18 plus putting the man back in manga.

636
00:43:40,091 --> 00:43:45,205
Speaker 1: People are gonna expect something horrible because the panels going at the same time are all hentai panels.

637
00:43:45,385 --> 00:43:46,990
Speaker 1: Yep, or yaoi or whatever.

638
00:43:47,411 --> 00:43:51,790
Speaker 1: Yep, so we're gonna be in the sea of yaoi and hentai and all these 18 plus people.

639
00:43:52,232 --> 00:43:57,090
Speaker 1: So they're gonna come in expecting the kind of thing that you get from an 18 plus panel and they're gonna get that.

640
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:09,381
Speaker 1: But they're also gonna get a good half of the panel is going to be very informative And we're going to try to trick them in and then teach them about Real manga and history of manga and Tezuka and all that stuff

641
00:44:09,462 --> 00:44:13,213
Speaker 0: and hopefully industry people will be there Recognizing that.

642
00:44:13,273 --> 00:44:15,078
Speaker 0: look see how crowded this panel is.

643
00:44:15,339 --> 00:44:17,385
Speaker 0: there is a demand for the manly mangas.

644
00:44:17,626 --> 00:44:18,930
Speaker 0: freaking bring them over here.

645
00:44:19,672 --> 00:44:22,041
Speaker 0: You could probably get them real cheap because no one else wants them.

646
00:44:22,522 --> 00:44:24,690
Speaker 1: I will point out we are not actually sexist.

647
00:44:24,811 --> 00:44:37,642
Speaker 0: However, putting the man back in mom I think we're gonna have a big disclaimer at the beginning of this panel even at Kinetic on because we're gonna say a lot of sexist things Just because a lot of the gecky guy is sexist and pretty horribly.

648
00:44:37,702 --> 00:44:38,143
Speaker 1: That's.

649
00:44:38,484 --> 00:44:46,350
Speaker 0: but while I disagree with the sexism It's entertaining and that's sort of one of the things that makes me like those sorts of mangas.

650
00:44:46,812 --> 00:44:51,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like how I can like Death Note, even though I can't agree with Death Note at all.

651
00:44:52,632 --> 00:45:02,102
Speaker 1: I think what the moral is going to be is do not come to our 18 plus gecky guy panel if you are easily Offended by the knowing it by the ranch as know-it-all something.

652
00:45:02,122 --> 00:45:03,606
Speaker 1: Holy Daryl Surratt anything.

653
00:45:03,647 --> 00:45:04,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, Daryl Surratt.

654
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:08,330
Speaker 1: Yes, if you're offended by Daryl Surratt do not come to our panel.

655
00:45:08,511 --> 00:45:10,804
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least not a gag that one come to the other one.

656
00:45:10,865 --> 00:45:11,690
Speaker 1: Yes come to the other ones.

657
00:45:11,971 --> 00:45:15,042
Speaker 0: Also at Otacon we have a table in the artists alley.

658
00:45:15,303 --> 00:45:17,390
Speaker 0: it's a table in the way back near the bathroom.

659
00:45:17,551 --> 00:45:20,410
Speaker 1: We actually traded with someone else who practically begged us to move.

660
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:22,257
Speaker 0: Yes, but they were also near the bathrooms.

661
00:45:22,738 --> 00:45:25,950
Speaker 0: all our friends who have tables are spread out all over the artists alley.

662
00:45:26,032 --> 00:45:26,628
Speaker 0: I looked at the map.

663
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:35,509
Speaker 0: So we're not gonna have like a podcast alley within the artists alley or anything like that, which is sad Maybe next year, but there will be things to do at our table.

664
00:45:35,589 --> 00:45:37,316
Speaker 1: Yes All I'm going to say basically

665
00:45:37,557 --> 00:45:55,670
Speaker 0: what we're gonna do is when we're not at an event or running an event We will be at the table and possibly we're gonna try to arrange it so that most of the time at least one of the front row crew will be manning the table and You can come to the table to get you know, talk to us or meet people or hang out or whatever.

666
00:45:56,171 --> 00:46:06,340
Speaker 0: we're also at Otacon going to arrange an informal meetup at some point probably like last year and More information on that once the Otacon schedule comes out and we know what time we should do that.

667
00:46:07,342 --> 00:46:16,483
Speaker 0: I Supercons This week is the last week of episodes of geek nights.

668
00:46:16,543 --> 00:46:30,406
Speaker 0: next week is gonna be like three episodes Maybe and the week after that for specials and we need people to You know make episodes of geek nights to fill in that week of four specials or else you're gonna get Episodes you're gonna get last year last year.

669
00:46:30,627 --> 00:46:33,623
Speaker 1: Yes Granted some people really like those episodes.

670
00:46:33,643 --> 00:46:35,090
Speaker 0: Some people did like those episodes.

671
00:46:35,352 --> 00:46:35,776
Speaker 1: You know what?

672
00:46:35,817 --> 00:46:41,470
Speaker 0: I like it poked in the eye - yes They like the episodes that someone else made for us more than they like those episodes.

673
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:47,246
Speaker 1: Yes, and I just want to say again that Richard and Allison from movies You should see did a really good job and they're really cool people.
