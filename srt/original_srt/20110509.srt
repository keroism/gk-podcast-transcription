1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,770
Speaker 1: It's Monday, May 9th, 2011.

2
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:11,012
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,485 --> 00:00:12,857
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,506
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,546 --> 00:00:17,639
Speaker 1: Tonight we talk about, I forget, oh yeah, memory.

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:19,360
Speaker 0: Nothing.

7
00:00:23,292 --> 00:00:24,309
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

8
00:00:27,072 --> 00:00:28,750
Speaker 1: You know, like my opening joke?

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,790
Speaker 0: Have you ever had an opening joke that I liked in six years, five years?

10
00:00:33,394 --> 00:00:33,969
Speaker 1: Pretty much now.

11
00:00:34,471 --> 00:00:34,532
Speaker 0: Now.

12
00:00:34,894 --> 00:00:37,750
Speaker 0: So, what do you think of, I think about this one?

13
00:00:38,052 --> 00:00:39,250
Speaker 1: I can't remember.

14
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:39,969
Speaker 0: Okay.

15
00:00:40,752 --> 00:00:42,444
Speaker 1: So, it's, you know, the end of spring.

16
00:00:42,524 --> 00:00:43,390
Speaker 1: It's the end of the season.

17
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,489
Speaker 1: I can't believe I forgot until just now.

18
00:00:46,351 --> 00:00:48,290
Speaker 1: As in yesterday when I ordered groceries.

19
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,350
Speaker 1: But, uh, it's fiddlehead season.

20
00:00:50,891 --> 00:00:53,690
Speaker 1: So I got some fiddleheads and I'm going to sauté them in garlic and butter.

21
00:00:54,251 --> 00:00:55,189
Speaker 1: In like an hour.

22
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,870
Speaker 0: Why don't you just eat the garlic and the butter?

23
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:02,370
Speaker 1: Well, the garlic and the butter you see are not food, but are merely things to put on food.

24
00:01:03,372 --> 00:01:04,316
Speaker 0: I disagree.

25
00:01:04,637 --> 00:01:07,990
Speaker 0: Butter dip butter is the most excellent of foods.

26
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,587
Speaker 1: Butter dip butter is more of an hors d'oeuvre.

27
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:13,162
Speaker 0: Is an hors d'oeuvre not food?

28
00:01:13,182 --> 00:01:14,330
Speaker 0: Food is the superset.

29
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,410
Speaker 1: If I eat it, does it not bleed deliciously into my mouth?

30
00:01:18,038 --> 00:01:18,209
Speaker 0: It does.

31
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,790
Speaker 1: If I tickle it, well, I guess it doesn't laugh.

32
00:01:22,911 --> 00:01:27,590
Speaker 0: It'll get your hands kind of greasy, and then you could use those greasy hands to make someone else laugh.

33
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,370
Speaker 1: Oh, there's something about, because I've been biking to work every day, right?

34
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,053
Speaker 1: And it used to be.

35
00:01:31,093 --> 00:01:34,230
Speaker 1: I'd subway to work, subway home, run, and then do stuff.

36
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,250
Speaker 1: But biking three times a day is kind of making me hungry all the time.

37
00:01:38,751 --> 00:01:44,630
Speaker 1: Which makes me think about food all the time, which makes me cook more often, because when I'm hungry I cook rather than eat out.

38
00:01:45,191 --> 00:01:46,229
Speaker 1: As a result, I've been cooking a lot.

39
00:01:47,292 --> 00:01:48,840
Speaker 1: I think I've mastered frittata.

40
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,569
Speaker 1: I've got to move on to full-on quiche now.

41
00:01:51,474 --> 00:01:51,685
Speaker 0: Blech.

42
00:01:52,551 --> 00:01:53,261
Speaker 1: What's wrong with you?

43
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:53,809
Speaker 1: Do you like eggs?

44
00:01:54,353 --> 00:01:54,525
Speaker 0: Yeah.

45
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:55,469
Speaker 1: Do you like nutmeg?

46
00:01:56,356 --> 00:01:56,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's alright.

47
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,304
Speaker 1: Onions?

48
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:57,799
Speaker 1: Yep.

49
00:01:58,332 --> 00:01:58,669
Speaker 1: Potatoes?

50
00:01:59,010 --> 00:01:59,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, potato's good.

51
00:02:00,094 --> 00:02:00,369
Speaker 1: Tomatoes?

52
00:02:00,776 --> 00:02:00,842
Speaker 1: Yep.

53
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:02,049
Speaker 1: Well, that's a quiche.

54
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,210
Speaker 0: No, quiche is disgusting.

55
00:02:03,652 --> 00:02:03,716
Speaker 1: Why?

56
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,070
Speaker 0: Because in their combination, a great evil is unfurled.

57
00:02:08,334 --> 00:02:09,410
Speaker 1: It's just egg pie.

58
00:02:09,832 --> 00:02:10,467
Speaker 0: That's disgusting.

59
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:11,609
Speaker 1: You eat egg custard.

60
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:12,990
Speaker 0: Egg custard is different.

61
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:13,665
Speaker 0: How so?

62
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:14,950
Speaker 0: That's egg cake.

63
00:02:16,914 --> 00:02:18,670
Speaker 1: I would argue an egg custard is a pie.

64
00:02:20,172 --> 00:02:22,810
Speaker 1: In the same way that a cheesecake is in fact a pie.

65
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,109
Speaker 0: Cheesecake is a cake.

66
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,690
Speaker 1: It's not made out of bread.

67
00:02:26,632 --> 00:02:27,810
Speaker 0: It has graham cracker crust.

68
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:29,747
Speaker 1: So does quiche.

69
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:32,189
Speaker 1: Sometimes.

70
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:33,303
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

71
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:34,209
Speaker 1: It's a pie crust.

72
00:02:35,914 --> 00:02:36,084
Speaker 1: Anyway.

73
00:02:37,275 --> 00:02:37,570
Speaker 0: Anyway.

74
00:02:38,055 --> 00:02:38,510
Speaker 1: It's Monday.

75
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,169
Speaker 1: It's tech day.

76
00:02:40,352 --> 00:02:43,090
Speaker 1: I had a lot I wanted to talk about, so I guess I had to narrow this down.

77
00:02:43,991 --> 00:02:47,350
Speaker 1: I'm gonna complain about a guy who wrote something stupid on the internet.

78
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,119
Speaker 1: So there's this guy on...

79
00:02:50,516 --> 00:02:50,967
Speaker 0: Uh, here we go.

80
00:02:51,531 --> 00:02:51,784
Speaker 1: InfoWorld.

81
00:02:52,511 --> 00:02:53,790
Speaker 1: This article was on Slashdot.

82
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,950
Speaker 1: It's actually making the rounds.

83
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,430
Speaker 1: A lot of people were talking about it.

84
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,508
Speaker 0: Slashdot, it made the rounds a week ago.

85
00:02:59,017 --> 00:02:59,103
Speaker 1: Yeah.

86
00:02:59,932 --> 00:03:02,290
Speaker 1: Thing is, I don't go to Slashdot to get stuff first.

87
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,310
Speaker 1: I go to Slashdot to get witty commentary.

88
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,830
Speaker 1: Or more importantly, Slashdot means I don't have to do research.

89
00:03:08,191 --> 00:03:09,790
Speaker 0: I don't read the comments on any site.

90
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,047
Speaker 0: Ever.

91
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,589
Speaker 1: I pretty much only go to Fark and Slashdot, and you know what I do?

92
00:03:14,031 --> 00:03:16,450
Speaker 1: I primarily read the comments and not the articles.

93
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:17,970
Speaker 0: Between us, you've read the whole internet.

94
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:18,649
Speaker 1: Pretty much.

95
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:25,430
Speaker 1: But basically, this is one of those guys who writes generic, techy articles that then nerds complain about, totally missing the point usually.

96
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:35,569
Speaker 1: He's the kind of guy that... Well, I've learned a lot about these guys, because way back when I worked at the hospital, and I was bored and thinking about quitting.

97
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:41,749
Speaker 0: The thing is, I've realized this problem in gaming and technology, and I'm sure it also exists in other areas, right?

98
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:42,830
Speaker 0: But consider this.

99
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,567
Speaker 0: If I read a restaurant review, right?

100
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:50,384
Speaker 0: That sounds pretty good to me, but I bet, I bet there are chefs out there who are like, "That restaurant critic doesn't know

101
00:03:50,425 --> 00:03:50,627
Speaker 0: shit.".

102
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,228
Speaker 0: Because if he knew shit, you know what he would be?

103
00:03:52,535 --> 00:03:52,788
Speaker 0: A cook.

104
00:03:53,271 --> 00:03:53,989
Speaker 1: Not necessarily.

105
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,950
Speaker 1: Perhaps he simply loves to eat cupcakes, but not to bake cupcakes.

106
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,846
Speaker 0: He can bake and eat the cupcakes together.

107
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,030
Speaker 1: But see, I think here's the problem.

108
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:10,390
Speaker 1: People who love food enough to review food, who also learn to be professional chefs, die of obesity immediately.

109
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,230
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

110
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,170
Speaker 0: There's a feedback loop.

111
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:18,890
Speaker 1: So thus, the people who are smart enough to not learn to cook are the only people who can survive being food critics.

112
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:25,210
Speaker 0: Right, but things that I know about, like technology and gaming, I see these journalists writing about gaming or technology.

113
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:30,210
Speaker 0: And I bet to normal people, they sound like they really know what they're talking about.

114
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:39,550
Speaker 0: But the fact is, as someone who actually does technology and knows games, I guess I don't technically do games, but I know a lot more about games than a lot of game journalists.

115
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:44,228
Speaker 1: Well, according to a lot of developers we've talked to, we think about games way more than they do.

116
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:46,850
Speaker 0: The journalists don't know anything.

117
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:54,510
Speaker 0: So this is probably some tech guy who, you know, if he knew more about technology, he would be a technologist and not a technology journalist.

118
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:54,967
Speaker 1: Maybe he is.

119
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,570
Speaker 1: What about people like John C. Dvorak?

120
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,082
Speaker 1: He knows a lot.

121
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,249
Speaker 0: He doesn't know nearly.

122
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:58,886
Speaker 0: No, he doesn't.

123
00:04:59,390 --> 00:04:59,989
Speaker 1: Let me put it this way.

124
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,022
Speaker 0: He knows more about technology companies than actual computers.

125
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:09,330
Speaker 1: John C. Dvorak has a great breadth of knowledge in the techno industry at large.

126
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,029
Speaker 1: It's very shallow.

127
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:15,150
Speaker 1: It is very shallow, but it is very breadthful and I can't disrespect him for that.

128
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:23,310
Speaker 0: But the thing is, most of those guys, he doesn't know about, you know, I mean, he knows enough about computers that he can use them and set them up and do all sorts of normal people things.

129
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,250
Speaker 1: He also knows effectively how to troll.

130
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:30,330
Speaker 0: But I mean, and he knows a lot about, you know, the tech companies.

131
00:05:30,992 --> 00:05:38,410
Speaker 0: And if he was writing an article about computers, it would go in the business section of the newspaper, not in the, you know, technology section of the newspaper.

132
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,450
Speaker 1: But he has more knowledge of tech than the vast majority of tech journalists.

133
00:05:42,196 --> 00:05:42,709
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's true.

134
00:05:43,491 --> 00:05:47,208
Speaker 0: But I mean, he's not going to be writing anything for like the ACM Journal or the IEEE, you.

135
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,810
Speaker 1: But I have for you a counterexample and then an anecdote.

136
00:05:51,392 --> 00:06:01,930
Speaker 1: Because the counterexample is that in the financial sector, I read articles on financial stuff and those people know way more than me or most other people in the field about the field.

137
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:02,706
Speaker 0: They know a lot.

138
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,150
Speaker 0: Then how come they're doing that instead of making mad money?

139
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:10,970
Speaker 1: They're making pretty good money because usually the people who are writing the things that I'm reading are also published academics.

140
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:20,430
Speaker 1: Anyway, the anecdotal evidence I have is that when I was sick of working at the hospital and I thought about giving up on IT completely, that was when I went to take the LSAT.

141
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:21,729
Speaker 1: I was like, I'll be a lawyer.

142
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,929
Speaker 1: And all the lawyer friends were like, God, no, you'll hate it.

143
00:06:24,371 --> 00:06:26,209
Speaker 1: And then I was like, OK, I'll be a journalist.

144
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:28,790
Speaker 1: And I actually applied to a bunch of tech journalism jobs.

145
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:35,209
Speaker 1: And I ghostwrote for a bunch of tech journals and websites because that's how you interview for places like that.

146
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:39,490
Speaker 1: You ghostwrite articles for them that they publish so they don't have to do work.

147
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,710
Speaker 1: They get free work, basically.

148
00:06:41,471 --> 00:06:46,449
Speaker 1: So I got my assignments and I wrote and basically the assignments were pathetic.

149
00:06:47,354 --> 00:06:50,330
Speaker 1: They were along the lines of X is popular.

150
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:57,409
Speaker 0: Write an article about how Y influences X so that we can get increase the search engine traffic as most people are searching for X.

151
00:06:57,855 --> 00:06:58,048
Speaker 1: Yep.

152
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:58,506
Speaker 0: Yep.

153
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:02,670
Speaker 1: And basically the vast majority of tech journalism seems to be that.

154
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:05,048
Speaker 1: And I after interviewing these people.

155
00:07:05,712 --> 00:07:06,387
Speaker 1: Yeah, I gave up.

156
00:07:06,637 --> 00:07:06,809
Speaker 1: Yeah.

157
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:10,789
Speaker 1: Well, I don't think Wired magazine exactly has the hard hitting tech writers either.

158
00:07:11,334 --> 00:07:12,670
Speaker 0: It has a few, but not many.

159
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:24,229
Speaker 1: So anyway, this dude, Galen Gruman, wrote this thing where he basically says that wireless network infrastructure is being neglected and it needs to be the core.

160
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:31,165
Speaker 1: It needs to be as well managed, as important, as central to enterprise as the wired network needs to be.

161
00:07:31,992 --> 00:07:33,290
Speaker 0: And in what way does he mean that?

162
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,710
Speaker 0: Does he mean like the backbone of the Internet should be wireless?

163
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:36,241
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

164
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:41,190
Speaker 1: So he has all these statistics, which I am highly half of them.

165
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:41,590
Speaker 1: I'm dubious.

166
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,350
Speaker 1: I just don't think they're accurate.

167
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:43,823
Speaker 1: Okay.

168
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:55,950
Speaker 0: And the other half, even if they're accurate, he is begging the question and drawing the absolute wrong conclusion, because I do think that a lot of enterprise people either a, they don't have wireless at all for security reasons.

169
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,187
Speaker 1: They don't need it.

170
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,950
Speaker 0: Well, I think that there are some significant benefits to having it.

171
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:10,630
Speaker 0: Even if you don't need it, it could be significantly beneficial and it is possible to make it secure enough as long as you don't use it, you know, for as long as you fence it off from certain applications.

172
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:10,820
Speaker 0: Right.

173
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:17,890
Speaker 0: It's like if people can get their exchange, their emails on their phones with Wi-Fi walking around the office.

174
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,830
Speaker 1: Ah, but so here's that's worse.

175
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:21,200
Speaker 1: Yes.

176
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:31,009
Speaker 1: One of the examples he uses is the rapid growth of smartphones and how many people have smartphones that have Wi-Fi capabilities and how if they could use those on the wireless network, things would be so much better.

177
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:43,289
Speaker 1: Yet the vast majority of what anyone does with a smartphone in any professional context is read email, get pages, respond to email and pages.

178
00:08:43,702 --> 00:08:43,890
Speaker 0: Yep.

179
00:08:44,111 --> 00:08:45,627
Speaker 1: You can do that over your three G's.

180
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:57,290
Speaker 0: Ah, but actually if I was enterprise and I'm worried about security, I would rather have if those things going over the Wi-Fi in my company on my company's network, then going over the three G of AT&T or something like that.

181
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:03,850
Speaker 1: But the Wi-Fi, so having the secure Wi-Fi would be pointless because the only reason to have one of those devices is because you're leaving the office.

182
00:09:04,093 --> 00:09:05,249
Speaker 1: You're going somewhere else.

183
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:09,010
Speaker 0: Yes, but at least more of the traffic that has the email.

184
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,730
Speaker 1: Nope, because no one uses their goddamn Blackberry when they're in the office.

185
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:13,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, they do.

186
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,990
Speaker 1: Whoo, their computer's there.

187
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:19,630
Speaker 0: You go look at any office that just people walking around the offices with Blackberries.

188
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:20,190
Speaker 1: You know what?

189
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:26,830
Speaker 0: I don't know what offices you've been to, but that's all I see when people are walking and anyone who gets up to walk around in the bathroom, phones are in their hands are looking at it.

190
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:27,549
Speaker 1: See, I've seen that.

191
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:27,950
Speaker 1: You know what?

192
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,810
Speaker 0: In conference rooms, Blackberries all over the table.

193
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:39,708
Speaker 1: The only people who are ever checking their email on their Blackberries in the offices were the mid-level executives, and most of the people I see walking around with a phone have a web page up.

194
00:09:40,152 --> 00:09:42,090
Speaker 0: I see everybody from top to bottom doing that.

195
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:42,969
Speaker 1: I don't see that.

196
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:49,370
Speaker 1: Of course, I've always worked in big enterprise where it's a very different environment, but nonetheless, I don't think there's any benefit to people.

197
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,650
Speaker 1: Plus, most Blackberries don't handle connecting to WANs gracefully.

198
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,090
Speaker 0: Well, who's using a Blackberry?

199
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,210
Speaker 0: Most enterprise users.

200
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,430
Speaker 0: I know, that's your other problem.

201
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,789
Speaker 0: Trash your Blackberry server.

202
00:09:59,652 --> 00:10:02,610
Speaker 0: Use Exchange and get Windows or Android or iPhones.

203
00:10:02,753 --> 00:10:03,690
Speaker 1: Now, we've talked about this.

204
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:09,590
Speaker 1: The plausible deniability of using Blackberry basically protects you from all possible litigation in the event of a problem.

205
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,990
Speaker 0: What's not plausibly deniable about an Exchange server?

206
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,290
Speaker 1: Hardly anyone uses that on phones for enterprise.

207
00:10:15,557 --> 00:10:16,149
Speaker 0: It will change.

208
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:16,686
Speaker 0: It works.

209
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:17,590
Speaker 1: It will change.

210
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, it works, but it's safer from a business perspective.

211
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,130
Speaker 0: These people already have Exchange servers.

212
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,489
Speaker 0: They just have to turn ActiveSync on.

213
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:24,746
Speaker 0: Done.

214
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,270
Speaker 0: One click.

215
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:30,870
Speaker 1: Plus, most of the people who care about this, who actually want to receive their work email, they're Blackberry types anyway.

216
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:32,770
Speaker 1: A lot of them don't have their own smartphone.

217
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,029
Speaker 1: A lot of them are happy to have gotten the work smartphone.

218
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:41,570
Speaker 1: Otherwise, he points out that the use of wireless printers is on the rise.

219
00:10:43,698 --> 00:10:44,210
Speaker 1: E-book readers.

220
00:10:44,771 --> 00:10:48,250
Speaker 1: He says 38% of these people in businesses have e-book readers.

221
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,549
Speaker 0: You don't need an e-book reader at work.

222
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:49,834
Speaker 0: No.

223
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,309
Speaker 0: What possible thing at work could you need?

224
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,870
Speaker 0: Why would you need the e-book reader to be on the work network?

225
00:10:55,835 --> 00:10:56,590
Speaker 1: Here's a good example.

226
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,810
Speaker 1: Barcode scanners for inventory control.

227
00:10:58,950 --> 00:10:59,270
Speaker 1: You know what?

228
00:10:59,270 --> 00:10:59,810
Speaker 1: Yeah.

229
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:01,510
Speaker 1: That's a great wireless application.

230
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,107
Speaker 1: And you know what?

231
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,910
Speaker 1: It requires effectively zero bandwidth.

232
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,289
Speaker 0: Yeah, almost none.

233
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:12,266
Speaker 0: You drop a couple access points strategically in the warehouse so that you get coverage, and that's it.

234
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:17,290
Speaker 0: Now, you could make a point- And you have those on a separate network where the barcode app is the only application accessible.

235
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:21,290
Speaker 1: His article is pretty stupid, and I disagree with almost everything he says.

236
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:29,110
Speaker 1: But there is a point to be made that one, wireless networks are almost always shitily managed or nonexistent in any company.

237
00:11:29,696 --> 00:11:30,930
Speaker 1: My company happens to do it right.

238
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:41,525
Speaker 1: We have a wireless network with proper authentication, and strangers in our office who are visiting, we can give them a code, they can connect, and they only get access to the internet and things we gave them access to.

239
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:46,570
Speaker 1: Completely sequestered from the real corporate network, let alone the production networks.

240
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:52,947
Speaker 1: Separately, say you're in a business where you need wireless on some sort of production network.

241
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:57,030
Speaker 1: You have two wirelesses on two different frequencies.

242
00:11:57,251 --> 00:12:01,030
Speaker 0: Even my house has four wirelesses on two different frequencies.

243
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:05,750
Speaker 0: My house, which only has one person living in it, with a router I bought on Amazon.

244
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:13,530
Speaker 1: One of the points the guy makes is that you need to centrally manage your wireless with the same level of efficiency and proficiency that you manage your wired network.

245
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:14,288
Speaker 1: No shit.

246
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:14,815
Speaker 1: Duh.

247
00:12:15,591 --> 00:12:17,530
Speaker 1: Manage all your IT professionally.

248
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:22,088
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think what he's saying, though, is there are a lot of places that just don't have wireless at all.

249
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:33,290
Speaker 1: Which is fine, because I would argue that in most business situations, most offices, it is cheaper, safer, faster, and more reliable to use wired for everything.

250
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:38,910
Speaker 1: Because almost any office space you go into will have a centralized network infrastructure already in the building.

251
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,790
Speaker 0: You gotta have a wireless, though.

252
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:46,929
Speaker 0: At the very least, you've got people coming into the office who are clients or outsiders and they wanna get some internets.

253
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:47,769
Speaker 1: Yup, and you know what?

254
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,988
Speaker 1: It's trivial to set up a DMZ wireless internet.

255
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,883
Speaker 0: I think there are places that have no wireless.

256
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,670
Speaker 1: But that doesn't seem to be what this guy's arguing.

257
00:12:54,850 --> 00:13:00,630
Speaker 1: He's arguing that your actual real corporate network, the one your real shit is on, should be mostly wireless.

258
00:13:00,852 --> 00:13:01,229
Speaker 0: That's retarded.

259
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:02,970
Speaker 1: I mean, wireless printer?

260
00:13:03,393 --> 00:13:03,890
Speaker 1: What the hell?

261
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,590
Speaker 1: You can't afford to run a cable?

262
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:11,490
Speaker 0: I guess if you had some kind of weird ass office and you couldn't wire it for some reason.

263
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:15,830
Speaker 1: I could see this being the case if you had places where people are highly mobile.

264
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,710
Speaker 1: A stupid office where people just use laptops and wander around all over the place.

265
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:31,530
Speaker 0: But the thing is, even if you have, let's say you have that, let's say you have an office that's a big open space, there's no walls or whatever, and everyone has MacBook Airs that don't have network cards, and everyone just has wireless everything and you roam around the office.

266
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,048
Speaker 0: You know what?

267
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:42,830
Speaker 0: You'll still need to run a wire to the access point from the internets, which is probably in the corner of the office on a rack or something, where your firewalls and your servers are.

268
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:43,910
Speaker 0: They have to be wired.

269
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:48,570
Speaker 0: You gotta run the wires anyway to the access points.

270
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:53,307
Speaker 0: You might as well stick a switch there instead of the access point, and suddenly you've gotta block it to cubes.

271
00:13:53,610 --> 00:14:04,429
Speaker 1: Actually, your example is pretty terrible because, yeah, that wire is a given, but if it's a big open space with nowhere to run wires, then yeah, wireless is a lot cheaper and easier than running wires.

272
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:05,594
Speaker 1: Eh.

273
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:10,690
Speaker 1: All over the office as opposed to a two foot wire from the router to the access point.

274
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,704
Speaker 0: No, but I mean, it depends how big the office is.

275
00:14:12,744 --> 00:14:13,450
Speaker 0: first of all, right?

276
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,590
Speaker 0: And second of all, wires are really cheap.

277
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:24,310
Speaker 0: You can get a whole bundle of them for nothing and you can get little switches for really nothing, but good access points can be very expensive if you need a lot of them.

278
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:27,070
Speaker 0: Like if you need five or six of them, that could be like a thousand dollars.

279
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:39,830
Speaker 1: The other thing is, I think a lot of newer companies that are starting up or people who are making new office spaces have this idea, and this article is playing to that, that going all wireless or going mostly wireless is a good idea.

280
00:14:40,411 --> 00:14:42,190
Speaker 1: And it introduces to me security problems.

281
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,690
Speaker 1: Wireless technology is not great.

282
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,230
Speaker 1: It introduces expenses.

283
00:14:45,433 --> 00:14:46,530
Speaker 0: Everyone's using wireless.

284
00:14:46,991 --> 00:14:53,030
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, when you go to a conference and too many people use wireless and it doesn't work, imagine that every day if you have a lot of people in the office.

285
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:53,966
Speaker 1: Yep.

286
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,129
Speaker 0: That would be the worst thing ever.

287
00:14:56,431 --> 00:14:57,530
Speaker 1: And I mean, that's it.

288
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,390
Speaker 1: I could go into more and more about why I think this article is pretty dumb.

289
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:05,350
Speaker 1: Like he goes on like 75% of users have tablets and tons of people have laptops.

290
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,789
Speaker 0: But you're not supposed to use those at work.

291
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,510
Speaker 1: What are you going to use a tablet for at work?

292
00:15:08,671 --> 00:15:10,150
Speaker 1: Unless you're walking around.

293
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:15,650
Speaker 0: Unless you're a developer who's developing a tablet application, in which case there's going to be like a Wi-Fi there for you.

294
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:23,967
Speaker 1: Or, one big use of tablets that is really important is anyone who has to be mobile and capture data from things.

295
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:28,350
Speaker 1: Like walking around, checking on business processes, or doing inventory control.

296
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:34,170
Speaker 1: A wireless barcode scanner and a tablet you can hold is a million times more efficient than any sort of other device.

297
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:50,490
Speaker 0: The thing is, even with systems like that, you know, like I said, cover the warehouse and wireless, or you could even just as efficiently set up some sort of system where you go around collecting data on the tablet and then when you're done you just put the tablet in a dock and then it gets wired and then all the data comes out.

298
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:53,310
Speaker 0: And that's just almost as efficient.

299
00:15:53,350 --> 00:16:01,668
Speaker 1: I guess my problem with fluff articles like this is that he makes a bold assertion that isn't really backed up and the data is kind of specious and shitty and independently.

300
00:16:01,688 --> 00:16:04,930
Speaker 1: the other point he makes that is legitimate is a useless point.

301
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:08,750
Speaker 1: He's basically saying wireless should be administered properly.

302
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:11,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, everything should be administered properly.

303
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:14,469
Speaker 1: So that's the end of my crotchety tech news.

304
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,348
Speaker 0: Anyway, you know they always have those poon to own things?

305
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:19,119
Speaker 0: Oh yeah!

306
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:23,649
Speaker 0: Where it's like, you know, if you can hack this laptop then you get it.

307
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:24,729
Speaker 0: And stuff like that.

308
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:28,649
Speaker 1: I detect a pronunciational shift from pun slowly to poon.

309
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:29,390
Speaker 0: Anyway.

310
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,348
Speaker 1: And eventually to pwn.

311
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,330
Speaker 0: I think that's how they pronounce the contest.

312
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:37,090
Speaker 0: But the point is, that contest happened a while ago and it won't be happening again for quite a while.

313
00:16:38,452 --> 00:16:41,710
Speaker 1: You know what, if you can beat me in Advanced Wars, I'll give you my copy of Advanced Wars.

314
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:42,687
Speaker 0: No, you have to give me the DS.

315
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:43,730
Speaker 0: That's how it would work.

316
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:44,324
Speaker 0: Fine.

317
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:45,086
Speaker 0: Yeah.

318
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:47,590
Speaker 0: But if I lose, I don't have to give you anything.

319
00:16:50,171 --> 00:16:52,010
Speaker 0: Well, Chrome always wins those things.

320
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,749
Speaker 0: Basically, no one ever cracks the Chrome.

321
00:16:54,810 --> 00:17:00,109
Speaker 0: But, just now, Vupen Security, V-U-P-E-N, has pwned.

322
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:00,882
Speaker 0: Pwned.

323
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:01,829
Speaker 0: Pooninated.

324
00:17:02,332 --> 00:17:03,209
Speaker 1: I do prefer pwned.

325
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,723
Speaker 1: I like the idea that- Owned-ed.

326
00:17:05,713 --> 00:17:10,690
Speaker 1: I know I'm the minority opinion, but before there was voice on the internet, there was a dichotomy.

327
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:11,969
Speaker 1: And people in some areas said pwn.

328
00:17:12,371 --> 00:17:13,608
Speaker 1: Some said poon, some said pwn.

329
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,410
Speaker 1: Pwn and own works because it fits the word.

330
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,767
Speaker 1: You were owned, you were pwned.

331
00:17:19,231 --> 00:17:20,549
Speaker 1: But the origin was a typo.

332
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,548
Speaker 1: Pwned is the way you would actually pronounce it as reading.

333
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:29,410
Speaker 0: Anyway, so these people, they have discovered a security problem in Google Chrome.

334
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:30,047
Speaker 0: They got it.

335
00:17:30,892 --> 00:17:32,810
Speaker 0: No one else has ever, I don't think, gotten one.

336
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,070
Speaker 0: At least not in recent memory.

337
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,789
Speaker 1: They got got.

338
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,870
Speaker 0: They got one, and it's of the biggest kind.

339
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:42,370
Speaker 0: It bypasses all security features, even the sandbox, and it's silent, so there's no crash.

340
00:17:42,993 --> 00:17:45,450
Speaker 0: And it's an undisclosed zero-day vulnerability.

341
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:50,667
Speaker 0: It works on all Windows systems and Chrome version 1169, whatever.

342
00:17:53,771 --> 00:17:56,129
Speaker 0: Basically, they have a video here that shows them doing it.

343
00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:02,230
Speaker 0: And they can, through Google Chrome, run arbitrary binary instructions on your computer.

344
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:02,863
Speaker 0: Period.

345
00:18:03,552 --> 00:18:04,750
Speaker 1: Glad I don't use Chrome.

346
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:10,490
Speaker 0: Well, I'm just saying, what's interesting about this story is not that somebody owned Chrome, even though that's kind of rare.

347
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:16,770
Speaker 0: It's that usually when someone discovers a vulnerability, they announce it in sort of different ways.

348
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:21,910
Speaker 0: There's the one where they just announce it to the world, and it's like, aha, you got to fix it now before everyone starts hacking you.

349
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:27,330
Speaker 0: Sometimes they're like, they whisper it to the company in question so that they can fix it and release a patch.

350
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:30,589
Speaker 0: And then when the patch comes out, then they announce it on the same day as the patch comes out.

351
00:18:31,292 --> 00:18:37,450
Speaker 0: Sometimes they whisper it to the company, but then they're like, company, you got 30 days to fix it or else we're going to announce it, right?

352
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:47,030
Speaker 0: In this case, the rumor seems to be that this Vupen Security is trying to do a blackmail situation.

353
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:47,470
Speaker 0: What?

354
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:51,590
Speaker 0: They're like, Google, pay us a bunch of money or else we'll tell.

355
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,150
Speaker 0: And Google already, I mean, I know Mozilla has bounties.

356
00:18:54,491 --> 00:19:04,290
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure Google also has some sort of bounties for finding, you know, for doing certain, finding certain vulnerabilities or solving bugs or features of some kind.

357
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:07,670
Speaker 1: There's a very fundamental moral, or I guess this is actually straight up ethics.

358
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,900
Speaker 0: Straight up legal, right?

359
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,110
Speaker 0: I mean, they're blackmailing something.

360
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:11,901
Speaker 1: Well, independently.

361
00:19:11,922 --> 00:19:12,350
Speaker 0: Is it ethical?

362
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,270
Speaker 0: Or at least extorting.

363
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:20,310
Speaker 1: Is it ethical to ask for a finder's fee for finding an undisclosed, unknown vulnerability in someone's software?

364
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,836
Speaker 0: Well, you're wording it differently.

365
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,987
Speaker 0: Is it extorting or is it blackmailing or is it finder's fee?

366
00:19:25,007 --> 00:19:25,730
Speaker 0: It's the same thing.

367
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:26,611
Speaker 1: Well, is it though?

368
00:19:26,631 --> 00:19:27,433
Speaker 1: Here's my question.

369
00:19:28,214 --> 00:19:35,910
Speaker 1: Is it a crime or should it be a crime to disclose truth that you acquired through legal means?

370
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,201
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, if they just disclose it, you know, I mean, people have done that.

371
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:40,205
Speaker 0: I don't really have a problem with that.

372
00:19:40,285 --> 00:19:41,289
Speaker 0: It's the extorting of money.

373
00:19:42,613 --> 00:19:44,617
Speaker 1: This is why it's an interesting argument.

374
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:50,050
Speaker 1: So it is OK to disclose a vulnerability that I find through legal means like it is ethically.

375
00:19:50,713 --> 00:19:52,304
Speaker 1: You can't fault someone for telling the truth.

376
00:19:52,344 --> 00:19:52,908
Speaker 1: Is that correct?

377
00:19:52,989 --> 00:19:53,190
Speaker 0: Right.

378
00:19:53,650 --> 00:20:00,130
Speaker 1: So is it ethical to tell someone else who could fix it and who is affected by it that it exists?

379
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:04,567
Speaker 0: This vulnerability, you could you could tell anyone whatever you want.

380
00:20:04,768 --> 00:20:05,070
Speaker 1: All right.

381
00:20:05,652 --> 00:20:07,739
Speaker 1: Is it ethical to say to them, here's the bug.

382
00:20:08,601 --> 00:20:11,230
Speaker 1: If you don't give me money, I will tell other people.

383
00:20:12,071 --> 00:20:14,138
Speaker 0: No, that's that's a line there.

384
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,302
Speaker 1: But how so?

385
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,590
Speaker 1: I'm I'm basically threatening telling the truth.

386
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,894
Speaker 0: You're threatening somebody.

387
00:20:19,095 --> 00:20:21,623
Speaker 0: But it's not that telling the truth is always OK.

388
00:20:21,703 --> 00:20:22,847
Speaker 0: It's threatening someone.

389
00:20:22,867 --> 00:20:23,509
Speaker 0: that's not OK.

390
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,875
Speaker 1: So what if I don't actually threaten?

391
00:20:26,356 --> 00:20:28,362
Speaker 1: What if I simply say I found this vulnerability.

392
00:20:28,382 --> 00:20:31,390
Speaker 1: I plan to tell the public in a week.

393
00:20:32,112 --> 00:20:32,616
Speaker 0: You can do that.

394
00:20:32,636 --> 00:20:34,147
Speaker 1: Dot, dot, dot.

395
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:36,372
Speaker 1: Hmm.

396
00:20:36,913 --> 00:20:39,924
Speaker 1: Unless, you know, someone gave me something.

397
00:20:39,984 --> 00:20:40,666
Speaker 0: Well, there you go.

398
00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:41,710
Speaker 0: You crossed the line again, didn't you?

399
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,473
Speaker 1: So that's the line?

400
00:20:42,493 --> 00:20:43,196
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think so.

401
00:20:43,357 --> 00:20:43,779
Speaker 1: So I can't.

402
00:20:44,221 --> 00:20:45,627
Speaker 1: What if I ask for a finder's fee?

403
00:20:45,647 --> 00:20:46,270
Speaker 1: I don't even blackmail.

404
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,939
Speaker 1: I just say, would you be willing to pay me for the fact that I found this?

405
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,950
Speaker 0: Well, I think there might already be a bounty or something.

406
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:52,834
Speaker 1: Without threatening.

407
00:20:52,874 --> 00:20:55,045
Speaker 1: Just saying, will you pay me for the fact that I found this?

408
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:55,789
Speaker 0: You can ask.

409
00:20:55,849 --> 00:20:56,070
Speaker 0: Sure.

410
00:20:56,430 --> 00:21:00,650
Speaker 1: And then if they don't respond or say no, if you just happen to release to the public.

411
00:21:01,711 --> 00:21:02,515
Speaker 1: The thing you found.

412
00:21:02,535 --> 00:21:03,800
Speaker 0: I mean, you're not threatening them.

413
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,969
Speaker 1: Ah, so implied threats are OK.

414
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,250
Speaker 0: It's not an implied threat if you're either threatening them or you're not.

415
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:14,750
Speaker 1: So as long as I don't actually directly threaten them, it's OK to blackmail the ever living fuck out of them.

416
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,720
Speaker 0: You're not blackmailing them if you're not threatening them.

417
00:21:17,504 --> 00:21:18,750
Speaker 0: Threat is part of blackmail.

418
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:22,480
Speaker 1: I sent someone the naked pictures I got of them and I'm like, hey, I found these pictures.

419
00:21:23,624 --> 00:21:25,310
Speaker 1: I'm thinking about just publishing them, you know.

420
00:21:27,952 --> 00:21:28,234
Speaker 0: All right.

421
00:21:28,274 --> 00:21:30,569
Speaker 1: Would you be willing to pay me for the pictures?

422
00:21:33,112 --> 00:21:33,495
Speaker 0: I don't know.

423
00:21:33,595 --> 00:21:34,823
Speaker 1: At what point did I make a threat?

424
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:35,669
Speaker 0: I don't know.

425
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,374
Speaker 0: The point is, I don't.

426
00:21:37,795 --> 00:21:41,670
Speaker 0: I think there is a definite line where if you threaten someone, that is no good now.

427
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,293
Speaker 1: I mean, my ethics are pretty simple.

428
00:21:43,353 --> 00:21:51,913
Speaker 1: My personal ethical analysis is that if I find a severe vulnerability in software that is publicly available, I would inform the company.

429
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:57,850
Speaker 1: But if they did not respond or take me seriously or agree to fix it in a reasonable span, I would announce it publicly.

430
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:58,992
Speaker 0: That's a good idea.

431
00:21:59,012 --> 00:22:01,641
Speaker 0: I really, you know, I don't even know what I do.

432
00:22:01,661 --> 00:22:04,149
Speaker 0: I might just be like, you know, I don't really go for it.

433
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,354
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't really care enough.

434
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:13,230
Speaker 0: I guess if it was, you know, I mean, if it was like a Mozilla situation where I know they have bounties, I would just be like, hey, you have a bounty I'd like to collect.

435
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:13,772
Speaker 0: Here you go.

436
00:22:14,134 --> 00:22:17,550
Speaker 1: I know tons of vulnerabilities in enterprise software because it's all shittily written.

437
00:22:19,494 --> 00:22:20,689
Speaker 0: You should go and blackmail them.

438
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,876
Speaker 0: Yeah, I should.

439
00:22:22,896 --> 00:22:24,460
Speaker 1: What am I going to blackmail them with?

440
00:22:24,681 --> 00:22:27,950
Speaker 1: I call up, you know, one of the huge, I'm not going to name any names because.

441
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:28,830
Speaker 1: Huge company.

442
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:35,010
Speaker 1: I call up one of these huge companies and be like, if you don't pay me, I'm going to tell the world that your software sucks balls.

443
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:35,882
Speaker 0: OK.

444
00:22:36,991 --> 00:22:37,776
Speaker 1: But it sucks.

445
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:38,723
Speaker 1: Don't you care?

446
00:22:38,743 --> 00:22:39,690
Speaker 1: Because no one cares.

447
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:40,250
Speaker 0: No one cares.

448
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,244
Speaker 1: So things of the day.

449
00:22:49,264 --> 00:22:50,049
Speaker 1: What do you got for me?

450
00:22:53,398 --> 00:22:54,130
Speaker 1: You forgot, didn't you?

451
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:54,666
Speaker 0: No, I didn't.

452
00:22:55,534 --> 00:22:58,190
Speaker 0: OK, so, you know, Star Trek, right?

453
00:22:58,996 --> 00:22:59,409
Speaker 1: Which one?

454
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,308
Speaker 0: That thing I don't like.

455
00:23:00,591 --> 00:23:02,009
Speaker 1: So any particular Star Trek?

456
00:23:02,651 --> 00:23:04,589
Speaker 0: Star Trek, I guarantee you've never seen or heard of.

457
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:05,415
Speaker 1: All right.

458
00:23:07,132 --> 00:23:09,150
Speaker 0: I know weird that I would know a Star Trek that you've never seen.

459
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:09,948
Speaker 1: Well, let's see.

460
00:23:10,496 --> 00:23:11,448
Speaker 1: So, I mean, not many.

461
00:23:13,011 --> 00:23:15,490
Speaker 1: See, I could make a dirty joke and be like, oh, you mean Voyager.

462
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:20,089
Speaker 0: But anyway, in the year nineteen hundred and seventy one.

463
00:23:20,978 --> 00:23:21,269
Speaker 0: Right.

464
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:22,690
Speaker 1: Star Trek Christmas special.

465
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:23,078
Speaker 0: No.

466
00:23:24,313 --> 00:23:24,949
Speaker 1: Star Trek cartoon.

467
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:25,350
Speaker 0: No.

468
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:33,370
Speaker 0: This twenty one year old dude who is in college at Ohio State University was in a class, a TV production.

469
00:23:33,811 --> 00:23:36,170
Speaker 1: Oh, I saw this on the Internet.

470
00:23:36,518 --> 00:23:36,830
Speaker 0: Yeah.

471
00:23:36,994 --> 00:23:37,306
Speaker 0: Yeah.

472
00:23:37,911 --> 00:23:44,690
Speaker 0: And as his final exam, he made a five minute episode of Star Trek on a one inch open real videotape.

473
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,470
Speaker 0: He transferred it to U-matic.

474
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:47,688
Speaker 0: I don't even know what the hell that is.

475
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:48,950
Speaker 0: He transferred it to Beta.

476
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:49,705
Speaker 0: I know what that is.

477
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,730
Speaker 0: And he got an A minus on his project.

478
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:53,446
Speaker 1: A minus.

479
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:56,450
Speaker 0: And now he has transferred it to YouTube.

480
00:23:57,174 --> 00:23:58,190
Speaker 1: As well he should.

481
00:23:58,552 --> 00:23:59,548
Speaker 0: And you can now watch it.

482
00:24:00,271 --> 00:24:01,108
Speaker 1: My head is off to you.

483
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:01,808
Speaker 1: Good sir.

484
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:04,369
Speaker 0: I don't even like Star Trek, but it's like, this is so hellish.

485
00:24:04,831 --> 00:24:06,329
Speaker 0: How can you not make a thing of the day?

486
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:09,790
Speaker 1: You know, I think you would actually like later next generation.

487
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:11,025
Speaker 0: Whatever.

488
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,209
Speaker 1: I think you would.

489
00:24:12,531 --> 00:24:14,269
Speaker 0: I'm watching better shows.

490
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:15,330
Speaker 1: What though?

491
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,050
Speaker 1: I mean, what problem do you have?

492
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,555
Speaker 1: Isn't the sci-fi you like?

493
00:24:18,937 --> 00:24:22,010
Speaker 1: hard sci-fi with serious ethical and scientific questions?

494
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,030
Speaker 1: And ambiguous answers?

495
00:24:24,391 --> 00:24:24,710
Speaker 0: You know what?

496
00:24:25,252 --> 00:24:29,630
Speaker 0: I don't like two spaceships sitting perfectly still, shooting lasers at each other, not even trying to dodge or anything.

497
00:24:30,272 --> 00:24:32,769
Speaker 1: That's actually probably how real space combat would be.

498
00:24:33,721 --> 00:24:33,785
Speaker 0: No.

499
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:37,030
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it would be more like X-Wing and TIE Fighter.

500
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:37,940
Speaker 1: No.

501
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:38,497
Speaker 0: Yeah.

502
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:39,709
Speaker 1: Probably not.

503
00:24:40,596 --> 00:24:41,530
Speaker 0: Or Descent 3.

504
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:42,530
Speaker 1: Move in all possible directions.

505
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,970
Speaker 1: Actually, if it wasn't like Star Trek.

506
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:44,670
Speaker 0: Or Free Space.

507
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:49,269
Speaker 1: You realize if it wasn't like Star Trek, Scott, it would be most likely very similar to Battlestar Galactica.

508
00:24:50,674 --> 00:24:51,530
Speaker 0: Which Battlestar Galactica?

509
00:24:51,954 --> 00:24:52,210
Speaker 1: New one.

510
00:24:53,077 --> 00:24:53,165
Speaker 0: Yeah.

511
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,630
Speaker 0: That was a pretty good space fighting game going on there.

512
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,990
Speaker 1: But Star Trek I think is similarly plausible.

513
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:02,350
Speaker 0: The point is, if there were space battles, all space- They would not be like Star Wars.

514
00:25:02,952 --> 00:25:04,729
Speaker 1: As much as we want them to be like Star Wars.

515
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:07,709
Speaker 0: Also, the space fighters would be able to move in any possible direction.

516
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:08,930
Speaker 1: There wouldn't be space fighters.

517
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:11,270
Speaker 1: There'd be cannons that shoot you from light years away.

518
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:12,646
Speaker 0: That also.

519
00:25:13,252 --> 00:25:14,010
Speaker 1: Like Star Trek.

520
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:15,650
Speaker 0: No, but they're right next to each other.

521
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:16,129
Speaker 1: No, they're not.

522
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,146
Speaker 0: Do you know how far away they are?

523
00:25:17,771 --> 00:25:20,370
Speaker 0: So that they can see each other and they can talk on the radio in real time.

524
00:25:20,631 --> 00:25:21,330
Speaker 0: On the video telephone.

525
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,509
Speaker 1: How do you know it's actually real time?

526
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,330
Speaker 0: They're talking on the video telephone in real time.

527
00:25:24,471 --> 00:25:25,250
Speaker 1: How do you know it's real time?

528
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:25,850
Speaker 0: Because there's no delay.

529
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,110
Speaker 1: How do you know there's no delay?

530
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:27,690
Speaker 0: There's no delay.

531
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,050
Speaker 1: How much Star Trek have you seen?

532
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,630
Speaker 0: They can even talk to Earth in real time.

533
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,370
Speaker 1: No, they can't.

534
00:25:31,411 --> 00:25:31,865
Speaker 0: No, they can't.

535
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:32,768
Speaker 1: No, they can't.

536
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:33,507
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure they do.

537
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,089
Speaker 1: So, my thing of the day.

538
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:38,934
Speaker 0: They can even, the spaceship even goes faster than the light, so the radios definitely can go.

539
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,062
Speaker 0: You know those videos.

540
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:41,082
Speaker 0: Ansibles.

541
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:45,167
Speaker 1: The videos where they make, someone takes a compilation of all the times.

542
00:25:45,207 --> 00:25:46,268
Speaker 1: Tom Hanks pees in a movie.

543
00:25:46,571 --> 00:25:47,188
Speaker 0: Oh, that's a good one.

544
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:48,290
Speaker 1: Well, that is a good one.

545
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,850
Speaker 1: We were at work the other day, right?

546
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:57,910
Speaker 1: We're having this lunch meeting and we're talking about movies and Tom Hanks movies came up and I brought up my anecdote about Tom Hanks peeing in movies.

547
00:25:58,432 --> 00:25:59,349
Speaker 1: Nobody believed me.

548
00:25:59,551 --> 00:26:00,148
Speaker 0: And you watched it.

549
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:01,406
Speaker 1: And I showed it and they were like, "Wow.

550
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:04,287
Speaker 1: How did you find that or know

551
00:26:04,368 --> 00:26:04,570
Speaker 1: that?".

552
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,510
Speaker 0: Because I look on the internet every day.

553
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:07,308
Speaker 0: What are you looking at?

554
00:26:07,551 --> 00:26:07,970
Speaker 0: Television?

555
00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:12,230
Speaker 1: The internet makes us likened unto wizards and/or gods.

556
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:15,870
Speaker 1: So this is a video that I'm happy someone made.

557
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,349
Speaker 1: Dave Riley will love this video.

558
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:22,170
Speaker 1: It is the great sandwiches from movies of all time.

559
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:22,970
Speaker 0: Oh, snap.

560
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,630
Speaker 0: I wonder, I can't even think of like that many great sandwiches.

561
00:26:25,993 --> 00:26:26,665
Speaker 1: It's got the PB&J.

562
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,769
Speaker 0: Was there a Blondie and Dagwood movie?

563
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:29,870
Speaker 1: Here's an example.

564
00:26:29,991 --> 00:26:30,469
Speaker 1: There was.

565
00:26:31,415 --> 00:26:32,250
Speaker 1: It's not in there, though.

566
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,365
Speaker 1: You've never seen that movie?

567
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,170
Speaker 0: No, but I'm sure it had a fucking giant sandwich in it.

568
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,070
Speaker 1: It's black and white.

569
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,769
Speaker 1: It's from the era of movies that you enjoy.

570
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,010
Speaker 0: Does it have a gigantic sandwich?

571
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:41,328
Speaker 0: Yes.

572
00:26:41,431 --> 00:26:41,988
Speaker 0: I'm sure it does.

573
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:46,370
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's got the PB&J and the kid from the never-ending story.

574
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,659
Speaker 0: Was there a Three Stooges sandwich?

575
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:48,830
Speaker 0: that was pretty epic?

576
00:26:49,811 --> 00:26:58,910
Speaker 1: I don't want to spoil this thing, but the number one sandwich is the sandwich that Dave makes when he has the presidential kitchen in the movie Dave.

577
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,269
Speaker 0: Oh, that's a fucking sandwich right there.

578
00:27:00,551 --> 00:27:02,130
Speaker 1: Dave is one of my favorite movies.

579
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:02,990
Speaker 0: It's a great movie.

580
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:06,970
Speaker 0: I thought it was one of my favorite movies, but it's a great movie that is not brought up enough.

581
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:07,450
Speaker 0: You know what?

582
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:10,746
Speaker 1: It's one of my favorite movies in the genre of politician.

583
00:27:10,766 --> 00:27:11,570
Speaker 1: does what's right.

584
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:22,289
Speaker 0: It's actually kind of funny because I never made the connection until just now, but it's basically Sanctuary/Eagle, but from the US, and I saw that before I ever heard about Sanctuary or Eagle.

585
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:22,601
Speaker 0: Yeah.

586
00:27:23,071 --> 00:27:24,650
Speaker 0: I think it's older than both of those.

587
00:27:24,971 --> 00:27:29,910
Speaker 1: And Dave and Bullworth are actually very similar movies except that Bullworth has the more realistic ending.

588
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:39,430
Speaker 0: Well, it's a rated G version, and I don't know if Dave is actually rated G, but it might be PG or PG-13 because there is a scene where the president has a heart attack having sex with a mistress.

589
00:27:39,851 --> 00:27:53,570
Speaker 1: If you've never seen the movie Dave, which was made in 1993, that was a long time ago, but I'm looking at the sandwich, and oh my God, I'm hungry now, when he's grating the carrots onto it at the end.

590
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,208
Speaker 0: It's a movie everybody needs to see.

591
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:56,730
Speaker 0: Oh, look at that sandwich.

592
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:57,690
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

593
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:58,256
Speaker 0: Yup.

594
00:27:58,773 --> 00:27:59,709
Speaker 0: Oh, ah.

595
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:02,290
Speaker 0: Taxpayers pay for that sandwich, but not really.

596
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:03,969
Speaker 0: Movie budget paid for that sandwich.

597
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:08,670
Speaker 0: I wonder how many times he had to do that scene where he made and ate the sandwich.

598
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:10,610
Speaker 1: He even eats, they show him eating the sandwich.

599
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:11,389
Speaker 0: I know.

600
00:28:11,571 --> 00:28:12,189
Speaker 0: Well, how could you not?

601
00:28:12,551 --> 00:28:13,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a good sandwich.

602
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:18,649
Speaker 0: And it'd be a really easy acting job, the eating part, so maybe there was only one take, but the making part might be hard.

603
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:19,950
Speaker 1: You know, that doesn't always work out.

604
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,029
Speaker 1: I mean, vitamin E to vegemin.

605
00:28:21,411 --> 00:28:27,249
Speaker 0: I'm just saying the making part might have had multiple takes, you know, and all the interns probably ate all those sandwiches.

606
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:36,009
Speaker 1: As an aside, I'm curious, you youngins out there, you kids listening to Geek Nights, does vitamin E to vegemin mean anything to you?

607
00:28:36,696 --> 00:28:36,908
Speaker 0: Maybe.

608
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:37,970
Speaker 1: I'm curious.

609
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,250
Speaker 1: Does it mean anything to you, Scott?

610
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:39,986
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know what it is.

611
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:40,527
Speaker 0: You do?

612
00:28:40,774 --> 00:28:40,950
Speaker 0: Yeah.

613
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:41,098
Speaker 1: Okay.

614
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:41,584
Speaker 1: I'm curious.

615
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,369
Speaker 1: Listeners, let me know if you know.

616
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:44,630
Speaker 0: I'm not really a big fan, though.

617
00:28:44,731 --> 00:28:45,065
Speaker 1: No, I'm not.

618
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,390
Speaker 1: Well, it's important to television history.

619
00:28:47,678 --> 00:28:47,848
Speaker 1: Yeah.

620
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:49,469
Speaker 1: But I'm just curious.

621
00:28:49,891 --> 00:28:54,430
Speaker 1: I feel like that was common knowledge in our generation, and I don't know if it's still common knowledge.

622
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:56,010
Speaker 0: It's not common knowledge in our generation.

623
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:59,510
Speaker 1: I think it is, due to one factor and one factor alone.

624
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,430
Speaker 1: Naked Night.

625
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,690
Speaker 0: A lot of kids didn't watch Naked Night.

626
00:29:03,051 --> 00:29:07,670
Speaker 0: And plus, anyone who's like one or two years younger than us, by the time that they... It's not our generation.

627
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:08,570
Speaker 0: Naked Night was gone.

628
00:29:08,752 --> 00:29:09,470
Speaker 1: Not our generation.

629
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:10,510
Speaker 1: We've proven this.

630
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:20,290
Speaker 1: You, me and Scojo remember all the same things from our childhood, and yet people born two years before us, completely different childhood, in terms of media.

631
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:28,124
Speaker 0: But the point is, I bet there's a whole bunch of people who are exactly... I bet there are people even older than us, like early 30s people, do not know what it is.

632
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:28,668
Speaker 0: Maybe not.

633
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:29,450
Speaker 1: The Naked Night factor.

634
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:36,857
Speaker 1: I think almost anyone born in America between 1979 and 1983 knows what vitamin and vegemin is.

635
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,850
Speaker 0: I don't know, because remember they moved it to TV Land, a different station?

636
00:29:40,071 --> 00:29:40,538
Speaker 0: That's when...

637
00:29:41,595 --> 00:29:42,288
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was the end.

638
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,170
Speaker 0: And then when SNCC came around.

639
00:29:44,512 --> 00:29:45,268
Speaker 1: Oh my God, SNCC.

640
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:48,309
Speaker 0: And there was no more... You couldn't really see Naked Night unless you stayed up way too late.

641
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:55,670
Speaker 1: And of course, in the meta moment, the Geek Nights book club, book club book, is still Isaac Asimov's foundation.

642
00:29:56,510 --> 00:30:00,430
Speaker 0: Yup, other interesting things, events around the town.

643
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:03,190
Speaker 1: We're gonna be at PAX Prime, if you wanna buy a badge.

644
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,430
Speaker 0: That's a long time from now.

645
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,310
Speaker 1: They're sold out, so, fucked.

646
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:08,910
Speaker 0: You could buy a bunch of single day badges, loser.

647
00:30:09,579 --> 00:30:09,706
Speaker 0: Anyway.

648
00:30:10,271 --> 00:30:11,149
Speaker 1: We might be at PAX Dev.

649
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:13,090
Speaker 1: Might be at Ode Account.

650
00:30:13,451 --> 00:30:20,429
Speaker 0: May 21st and 22nd is BarCampNYC, you gotta go to the website and register, even though it's free.

651
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,949
Speaker 0: You have to register for each day separately, but it's free.

652
00:30:23,491 --> 00:30:24,008
Speaker 0: You should go.

653
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:29,350
Speaker 0: I'm helping organize that shit, even though I'm gonna be really tired, because I'm gonna be up all night Friday, May 20th in the library.

654
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,270
Speaker 1: Running around the library, chasing Slimer.

655
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,130
Speaker 0: I don't think I'll be running around the library.

656
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,110
Speaker 0: Other interesting events.

657
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:40,090
Speaker 1: This weekend, Board Game Night, NerdNYC, down at Think Coffee.

658
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:40,418
Speaker 0: Friday.

659
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:41,287
Speaker 0: Friday.

660
00:30:42,171 --> 00:30:46,750
Speaker 0: And June 18th is Recess All Day, Board Game Night, basically.

661
00:30:47,897 --> 00:30:48,450
Speaker 0: And that's good enough.

662
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:49,269
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's good enough.

663
00:30:49,894 --> 00:30:50,809
Speaker 0: You should follow me on Twitter.

664
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,530
Speaker 1: And you should follow me on Twitter.

665
00:30:52,711 --> 00:30:53,428
Speaker 0: A-P-R-E-C-H-E.

666
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:53,830
Speaker 1: You know what?

667
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:59,750
Speaker 1: Follow @APRECHE, @S-C-H-E-Z-A-R, and @GeekNights.

668
00:31:00,671 --> 00:31:02,230
Speaker 1: Rhymes with weeknights.

669
00:31:03,475 --> 00:31:04,489
Speaker 0: I think they can figure that one out.

670
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,089
Speaker 1: You know, it amazes me.

671
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:06,650
Speaker 1: It's weird.

672
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:11,010
Speaker 1: People I talk to who are our age, who are connected to the internet, I'm like, "Geek

673
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:11,370
Speaker 1: Nights."

674
00:31:11,432 --> 00:31:11,845
Speaker 1: And they're like, "Oh,

675
00:31:11,866 --> 00:31:11,990
Speaker 1: okay."

676
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:12,667
Speaker 1: And they just Google it.

677
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:19,329
Speaker 1: People who aren't super internet-y, or who are a lot older, usually I say, "Geek

678
00:31:19,369 --> 00:31:19,530
Speaker 1: Nights.".

679
00:31:19,631 --> 00:31:20,964
Speaker 1: They're like, "How do I find

680
00:31:20,985 --> 00:31:21,025
Speaker 1: it?"

681
00:31:21,632 --> 00:31:22,608
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "Google for

682
00:31:22,649 --> 00:31:22,690
Speaker 1: it."

683
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:23,501
Speaker 1: And they're like, "Google for

684
00:31:23,521 --> 00:31:23,724
Speaker 1: what?".

685
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:24,801
Speaker 1: I'm like, "Geek

686
00:31:24,842 --> 00:31:25,147
Speaker 1: Nights.".

687
00:31:25,615 --> 00:31:26,184
Speaker 1: "What do you mean, 'Geek

688
00:31:26,225 --> 00:31:26,509
Speaker 1: Nights'?"?

689
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:28,490
Speaker 1: Like, "Weeknights, but geek.

690
00:31:28,731 --> 00:31:29,621
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for

691
00:31:29,662 --> 00:31:29,743
Speaker 1: me?".

692
00:31:34,214 --> 00:31:35,890
Speaker 1: This happens to be a lot of conventions.

693
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:41,610
Speaker 0: And this is why, in the olden days, old people were smarter than the young people, right?

694
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:43,147
Speaker 0: When an old man walks in?

695
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:49,410
Speaker 0: They had the years and years of experience and knowledge built up in their brains, whereas young people didn't.

696
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:54,350
Speaker 0: And the young people needed to live and learn and learn and learn and learn to get enough in their brains to become old people.

697
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:57,870
Speaker 0: But now, everyone has a library in their pocket.

698
00:31:58,051 --> 00:32:04,069
Speaker 0: And only young people actually go to the library, whereas old people are still going to the library.

699
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:07,610
Speaker 1: I feel like I need to differentiate, because there's two kinds of old.

700
00:32:08,112 --> 00:32:09,609
Speaker 1: We need separate words.

701
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:13,590
Speaker 1: Because on one hand, there's physically old, like you've lived longer.

702
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,601
Speaker 0: No, I'm saying old of mind.

703
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:18,969
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'm saying you do generate, by being older, even of mind, wisdom.

704
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:25,469
Speaker 1: I know a lot of weird stuff about being alive that I realized, talking to punk kids in the forum, they don't know.

705
00:32:26,253 --> 00:32:28,210
Speaker 1: They don't know things about checking accounts.

706
00:32:29,191 --> 00:32:31,147
Speaker 0: No, but you can learn them if you go on Google.

707
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:34,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I learned them because I'm old.

708
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:35,422
Speaker 0: It just happens.

709
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,508
Speaker 0: I learned them because I got a checking account.

710
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:37,900
Speaker 0: Yeah.

711
00:32:38,152 --> 00:32:39,205
Speaker 0: I went to the bank and said,

712
00:32:39,246 --> 00:32:39,387
Speaker 0: "Hey.".

713
00:32:39,631 --> 00:32:40,848
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you knew to even do that.

714
00:32:42,513 --> 00:32:44,050
Speaker 0: I wonder about checking accounts.

715
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:47,150
Speaker 0: Maybe I should go to the bank or the bank's website.

716
00:32:48,672 --> 00:32:55,621
Speaker 1: But anyway, I think really what it comes down to is people who are conservative, generally conservative, as in this far, no farther.

717
00:32:58,512 --> 00:33:01,950
Speaker 1: Those are the people who don't realize they can just go to Google.

718
00:33:02,251 --> 00:33:03,010
Speaker 1: Not even go to Google.

719
00:33:03,251 --> 00:33:11,609
Speaker 1: If they just go to the bar at the top of their computer, because the Internet Explorer is the computer, and type geek nights, it'll probably get to us.

720
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:12,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably.

721
00:33:13,832 --> 00:33:16,070
Speaker 1: Anyway, talking about memory.

722
00:33:17,232 --> 00:33:23,228
Speaker 0: Right, so we got this idea because a lot of people don't understand how memory in a computer works.

723
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:36,376
Speaker 1: The same argument comes up in our forum regularly where someone says, "I prefer browser X over browser Y or application X over application Y because application Y uses way more memory than

724
00:33:36,622 --> 00:33:36,642
Speaker 1: X.".

725
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:39,670
Speaker 0: Right, we'll get to that because that's what spurred this idea on.

726
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:47,970
Speaker 0: We'll discuss that issue later, but we decided let's do a show on memory, period, because people don't know how that shit works, right?

727
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:53,469
Speaker 0: So basically, the thing is your computer, the number one most important thing in a computer is memory.

728
00:33:53,851 --> 00:33:55,710
Speaker 1: Because a processor can process all it wants.

729
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,890
Speaker 1: All right, I add two binary numbers, great.

730
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:00,389
Speaker 1: Where does the answer go?

731
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:05,967
Speaker 0: Right, a transistor can be on or off, but it's basically doing work.

732
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,319
Speaker 0: It's like a saw.

733
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:15,650
Speaker 0: A saw can cut two pieces of wood, but you got to put the wood somewhere after it falls off the edge of the cutting board, right?

734
00:34:16,351 --> 00:34:22,530
Speaker 0: So memory can hold a zero or a one in it and keep that zero or one there.

735
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:25,290
Speaker 0: A transistor can't hold on to a zero or one.

736
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:27,149
Speaker 1: Well, it can if you don't ever give it anything else.

737
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:30,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you can't read, you know, it's not memory, right?

738
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:35,909
Speaker 0: So memory is pretty much any, you know, anything that can hold on to data.

739
00:34:36,632 --> 00:34:39,070
Speaker 0: You can say memory, remember this zero, okay.

740
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:42,790
Speaker 0: And then later you can come back and say memory, what are you holding in you?

741
00:34:42,851 --> 00:34:43,848
Speaker 0: And he'll say zero, sir.

742
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:44,949
Speaker 0: That is memory.

743
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:45,870
Speaker 1: I mean, think of it this way.

744
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:52,170
Speaker 1: If I make a really simple circuit, just wires that represent binary numbers, I can add them together with a very simple circuit.

745
00:34:52,512 --> 00:34:53,768
Speaker 1: I don't even need transistors.

746
00:34:54,002 --> 00:34:54,130
Speaker 0: Nope.

747
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:55,797
Speaker 1: And the result will come out.

748
00:34:55,837 --> 00:34:57,670
Speaker 0: the other end, which are probably made of transistors.

749
00:34:57,810 --> 00:35:04,110
Speaker 1: So if I connect the end to light bulbs, I have a circuit that performs one calculation once forever.

750
00:35:04,799 --> 00:35:05,009
Speaker 0: Yep.

751
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:08,830
Speaker 1: So if I turn the computer off and turn it back on, it gives me the same answer again.

752
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:09,298
Speaker 0: Yep.

753
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:18,310
Speaker 0: So a CPU with its billions of transistors, right, can do a lot of work of adding and multiplying and dividing and moving and reading and writing.

754
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:23,410
Speaker 0: But it can't actually remember anything except for the fact that it has a little bit of memory in it.

755
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:28,969
Speaker 0: The most important memory in the whole computer, the registers, the memory that only computer scientists know about.

756
00:35:29,971 --> 00:35:38,589
Speaker 0: How many registers do you think are like in, I mean, every different chip in the world has different kind of chip, at least has different numbers of registers of different sizes with different purposes.

757
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:39,908
Speaker 1: The numbers have gone up.

758
00:35:40,211 --> 00:35:40,297
Speaker 1: Yeah.

759
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:48,050
Speaker 0: But I think I'm pretty sure that like an x86 CPU or a 64 bit CPU only has like eight or 16 registers in it.

760
00:35:48,291 --> 00:35:49,661
Speaker 0: It's not a lot of registers.

761
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:50,950
Speaker 0: and the registers.

762
00:35:51,314 --> 00:35:52,144
Speaker 0: Guess how big they are?

763
00:35:53,916 --> 00:35:54,670
Speaker 1: I wonder if they've guessed.

764
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:56,130
Speaker 1: I wonder if we should do this like Blue's Clues.

765
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:56,685
Speaker 0: I don't know.

766
00:35:56,850 --> 00:36:02,890
Speaker 0: But yeah, if you haven't figured it out, in a 64 bit chip, each register holds 64 bits usually, right?

767
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:06,623
Speaker 1: So it used to be that it mattered a lot.

768
00:36:07,024 --> 00:36:08,610
Speaker 1: as to when you're thinking about performance.

769
00:36:09,111 --> 00:36:12,610
Speaker 1: People talk about level one cache, level two cache, level three cache.

770
00:36:13,091 --> 00:36:15,990
Speaker 1: And if we want the broader picture, let's zoom way out from registers.

771
00:36:16,991 --> 00:36:18,149
Speaker 1: The CPU is doing stuff.

772
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:21,170
Speaker 1: You've got memory right at the CPU.

773
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:26,030
Speaker 1: Like the memory, the CPU is directly accessing the registers on its die, in fact.

774
00:36:26,211 --> 00:36:26,589
Speaker 0: The registers.

775
00:36:26,892 --> 00:36:26,978
Speaker 0: Yeah.

776
00:36:27,291 --> 00:36:27,398
Speaker 1: Yeah.

777
00:36:27,791 --> 00:36:34,668
Speaker 1: And as you zoom out, you've got memory that's further and further away, both physically and computationally from the CPU.

778
00:36:35,355 --> 00:36:36,510
Speaker 1: It's further away physically.

779
00:36:36,933 --> 00:36:39,549
Speaker 1: So it takes more time to get stuff out of it.

780
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:45,849
Speaker 1: It's further away temporarily because usually to make it bigger, you have to have levels of abstraction on top of it.

781
00:36:46,131 --> 00:36:50,306
Speaker 1: You know, you address the memory like, give me this chunk of memory, give me that chunk of memory.

782
00:36:50,891 --> 00:36:52,290
Speaker 0: You're getting way too ahead of yourself here.

783
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,890
Speaker 0: Basically, you know, the thing is memory, right?

784
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:57,250
Speaker 0: There's a quantum problem here, right?

785
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:01,310
Speaker 0: And that you want to have a lot of memory, but memory takes up a lot of space.

786
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:06,030
Speaker 0: And even though it's a couple inches, that matters a fuck ton, right?

787
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,810
Speaker 0: A transistor is a quantum device.

788
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:11,470
Speaker 0: It's operating on the level of electrons, right?

789
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:15,390
Speaker 0: So if the thing is an inch away, that makes all the difference in the universe.

790
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:25,510
Speaker 0: That's why the memory that is closest to the CPU, basically the fastest memory there is, is so tiny because that's all you can fit in a small enough space to actually work that quickly.

791
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:31,030
Speaker 1: Now, there are more concerns, too, about power and addressing and we're not I mean, you don't care about the core level.

792
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,169
Speaker 1: No one cares, except computer engineers.

793
00:37:34,115 --> 00:37:35,129
Speaker 1: Even they often don't care.

794
00:37:35,752 --> 00:37:39,429
Speaker 1: But basically, the point I want to get at is that you've got these you've got this hierarchy of memory.

795
00:37:40,153 --> 00:37:42,390
Speaker 1: And as you go further away, it gets slower and slower and slower.

796
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:51,210
Speaker 1: You know, then eventually after all these caches, you get to the RAM and then after that, you get to the disks and then after that, you get to stuff you've stored out on the Internet.

797
00:37:51,451 --> 00:37:51,673
Speaker 1: Yeah.

798
00:37:52,015 --> 00:37:54,010
Speaker 1: And then after that, you get to stuff stored on tape.

799
00:37:54,353 --> 00:37:56,070
Speaker 1: I mean, tape is memory.

800
00:37:56,251 --> 00:37:58,248
Speaker 1: It's just really fucking slow to get at it.

801
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,867
Speaker 0: Some guys got to go to the closet to get it.

802
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,170
Speaker 0: You got to put it in the machine.

803
00:38:02,272 --> 00:38:03,410
Speaker 0: You got to run the tape through.

804
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:04,429
Speaker 0: All right.

805
00:38:04,871 --> 00:38:07,310
Speaker 0: But anyway, you know, the way a computer works, right?

806
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:09,429
Speaker 0: People don't seem to realize this when you turn it on.

807
00:38:09,851 --> 00:38:14,630
Speaker 0: What a computer does use most computers is they look at addresses in memory, right?

808
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:16,570
Speaker 0: All the memory in the whole computer has addresses.

809
00:38:17,151 --> 00:38:23,550
Speaker 0: And the computer, when it turns on, looks at address number zero usually, at least in most computers.

810
00:38:24,071 --> 00:38:31,830
Speaker 0: And it takes whatever is in the memory at address number zero, loads it into a register and then does whatever that says to do.

811
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:46,130
Speaker 0: And usually it'll say something like, you know, go to address, you know, read some memory from, you know, read from the disk this and put it in this area of memory and then move forward to number one and start working again.

812
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:46,814
Speaker 1: So think of this.

813
00:38:47,076 --> 00:38:48,990
Speaker 1: You got bio, you know, computer starts from nothing.

814
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:54,173
Speaker 1: It executes one hard coded instruction and it that tells it where to look, where to look, where to look.

815
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:55,590
Speaker 1: Eventually, it's the bootloader hits.

816
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:59,355
Speaker 1: The disk pulls up the beginning of your operating system, which then loads the rest of the operating system.

817
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:01,110
Speaker 0: Think of it like you have a book of instructions.

818
00:39:01,431 --> 00:39:01,712
Speaker 0: Right.

819
00:39:01,874 --> 00:39:04,270
Speaker 0: And the instructions all have line numbers on them.

820
00:39:04,371 --> 00:39:05,749
Speaker 0: It's like a choose your own adventure book.

821
00:39:05,911 --> 00:39:06,172
Speaker 0: Right.

822
00:39:06,554 --> 00:39:09,370
Speaker 0: And it starts at zero, a really boring one, a really boring one.

823
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:12,690
Speaker 0: It starts at zero and there's an instruction and you follow the instruction.

824
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:13,936
Speaker 0: And then, you know, you go.

825
00:39:14,056 --> 00:39:18,196
Speaker 0: if it doesn't tell you to go somewhere else, you just go to one and do the next instruction.

826
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:25,220
Speaker 0: And if that doesn't tell you to go somewhere else, like go to number 30 or something like that, you go to number two and just follow the instructions straight through.

827
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:25,970
Speaker 0: And that's the computer.

828
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:26,994
Speaker 0: That's how a computer works.

829
00:39:27,376 --> 00:39:32,550
Speaker 0: And the way it does this is there's a register that has the current number of the line it's on.

830
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:34,349
Speaker 0: So it always remember what line it's on right now.

831
00:39:35,012 --> 00:39:40,409
Speaker 0: And there's another register that has the thing you should do right now, the current instruction that you should be doing.

832
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:53,410
Speaker 0: And all the computer does is it looks in the memory at, you know, whatever number it's supposed to be on, follows that instruction and then makes the number go up by one and follow the next instruction.

833
00:39:53,653 --> 00:39:54,610
Speaker 0: That's all the computer does.

834
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:55,496
Speaker 0: It just goes through.

835
00:39:55,557 --> 00:39:57,170
Speaker 0: the memory is where all the instructions are.

836
00:39:57,473 --> 00:39:58,689
Speaker 0: It's the most important thing.

837
00:39:59,051 --> 00:39:59,593
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

838
00:39:59,673 --> 00:40:06,010
Speaker 1: I just noticed that my thing of the day, that line underneath says this also serves as an in memoriam reel.

839
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:10,010
Speaker 1: And I realized that every one of those sandwiches died in the course of production.

840
00:40:11,911 --> 00:40:17,010
Speaker 1: Anyway, so all that stuff, the core of it doesn't really matter.

841
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:20,651
Speaker 1: You should understand like you should remember what registers are and caches and everything.

842
00:40:20,671 --> 00:40:26,692
Speaker 1: But really, everything under RAM, faster than RAM doesn't matter to the average user.

843
00:40:26,733 --> 00:40:30,750
Speaker 1: You buy a CPU, whatever CPU you buy has all that.

844
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:41,996
Speaker 1: Like like when you think about the subtle differences between a Xeon processor or, you know, an I7, I9, I5 core, whatever, some of that has to do with how much caching it has, how many registers.

845
00:40:42,017 --> 00:40:43,550
Speaker 1: that's where they are, how they're accessed.

846
00:40:44,412 --> 00:40:46,030
Speaker 0: But well, the number of registers isn't going to be there.

847
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:48,690
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, but how they're accessed, how much cash there is.

848
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,570
Speaker 1: Is there a level two cash, level three cash?

849
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:53,249
Speaker 1: You know, all that stuff is an on die off die.

850
00:40:54,450 --> 00:41:00,730
Speaker 0: Basically, the way it works is computers generally automatically write like let's say you're watching a video or something like that.

851
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:01,071
Speaker 0: Right.

852
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:04,452
Speaker 0: Well, it loads the video from the hard drive into the memory so it can actually read it.

853
00:41:04,974 --> 00:41:11,610
Speaker 0: And then, you know, if there's a the program that's actually decoding the video, right, is probably getting used a whole lot.

854
00:41:11,891 --> 00:41:17,014
Speaker 0: So it'll probably move some parts of that program or the whole thing into the cache because it keeps going.

855
00:41:17,035 --> 00:41:20,188
Speaker 0: It keeps using that all so often, you know, that it can.

856
00:41:20,329 --> 00:41:24,890
Speaker 0: the computer can go a lot faster if it keeps that data closer to the CPU.

857
00:41:25,153 --> 00:41:26,770
Speaker 1: Now, the same thing happens at every level.

858
00:41:27,032 --> 00:41:29,750
Speaker 1: So the level that matters to you guys is RAM because you do the same thing.

859
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,890
Speaker 1: You've got shit on the disk and shit in your RAM.

860
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:40,110
Speaker 1: If you pull something from the disk into RAM to do something with it, because it's a lot faster, RAM is orders of magnitude faster than the disk.

861
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,810
Speaker 0: Even if you have a solid state drive, it's still orders of magnitude faster.

862
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:53,589
Speaker 1: It's a good idea if you've got a lot of RAM to keep whatever you just read off the disk in the RAM because it costs you almost nothing to get rid of it from the RAM if you don't need it anymore.

863
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,710
Speaker 1: But if it's in the RAM, it's really fast to do that thing again.

864
00:41:58,592 --> 00:42:02,670
Speaker 1: And at every level between any two kinds of memory, the same basic logic is going on.

865
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:09,809
Speaker 1: This is why it doesn't matter that applications use a lot of RAM unless you don't have enough RAM.

866
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:14,992
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's pretty much like, you know, let's say you're thinking about your wallet, right?

867
00:42:15,012 --> 00:42:37,749
Speaker 0: You got a bunch of credit cards in your wallet and you put the credit card that you use the most often in the front and you put the credit card that use the least often in the back and that, you know, and every every time you use a credit card, you move it to the front, then eventually they're going to automatically be arranged in this really efficient, you know, you know, way to where the most used ones are the easiest to get at and you'll save the most time.

868
00:42:37,931 --> 00:42:39,722
Speaker 1: You take a hit if you got to get the credit card.

869
00:42:39,742 --> 00:42:40,990
Speaker 1: that's not in the nice part.

870
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:43,850
Speaker 1: There's like buried under your license, your driver's license or something.

871
00:42:44,193 --> 00:42:45,249
Speaker 1: It's like when you have a cash miss.

872
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:45,751
Speaker 0: Yeah.

873
00:42:45,791 --> 00:42:48,450
Speaker 0: But the thing is, you know, that that'll help you go the fastest.

874
00:42:48,631 --> 00:42:54,070
Speaker 0: But it's not like, you know, you're going to be better off if you leave some empty slots in your wallet, right?

875
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:55,930
Speaker 0: Empty slots don't get you anything.

876
00:42:56,050 --> 00:43:04,350
Speaker 0: You might as well put some cards in there because maybe you will need them and it'll be a lot slower to go back home and get them than if they were in those empty slots.

877
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:10,369
Speaker 0: So there is no reason not to fill up your entire wallet if you have enough cards to fill up the whole wallet.

878
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:24,050
Speaker 1: Where this misconception that Firefox or something using a ton of RAM is a bad idea that came from seems to be that for a long time, Linux, the philosophy of memory management in Unix and Linux systems was use all the goddamn RAM.

879
00:43:24,431 --> 00:43:25,481
Speaker 0: It still is.

880
00:43:25,623 --> 00:43:26,310
Speaker 1: It always has been.

881
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:30,530
Speaker 0: If you go, Linux automatically does this for you without even realizing it.

882
00:43:30,931 --> 00:43:34,730
Speaker 0: It automatically caches as much as it can from disk no matter what.

883
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:41,350
Speaker 0: And if you type free space minus M on the command line on a Linux machine, it'll show you how much memory is free and used.

884
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,590
Speaker 0: And there'll be one line.

885
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:44,390
Speaker 0: This is plus minus buffers cache.

886
00:43:44,912 --> 00:43:51,870
Speaker 0: And even though it might seem to you by reading that chart that you have zero memory free, the fact is you actually have a lot free.

887
00:43:51,991 --> 00:43:56,714
Speaker 0: It's just caching so much from the disk so that it doesn't have to go and read from the slow ass hard drive.

888
00:43:56,754 --> 00:43:59,830
Speaker 1: I mean, basically you play MP3 and the MP3 is five megs.

889
00:44:00,251 --> 00:44:03,190
Speaker 1: The whole thing is just in RAM unless something else needs that RAM.

890
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:03,631
Speaker 0: Yeah.

891
00:44:03,651 --> 00:44:09,053
Speaker 0: Linux keeps, you know, your dentist card that you use once every six months in the wallet.

892
00:44:09,174 --> 00:44:12,170
Speaker 0: if you just used it, because, you know, well, why not?

893
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:16,397
Speaker 0: I'm not I don't have anything else in the wallet, so maybe I'll maybe I'll get my teeth knocked out.

894
00:44:16,437 --> 00:44:17,769
Speaker 0: I don't want to have to go back home to get it.

895
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:19,290
Speaker 1: Many people didn't know about computers.

896
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:24,013
Speaker 1: They had a Windows computer back in like the three days, the 311 days, the Windows 95 days.

897
00:44:24,736 --> 00:44:28,254
Speaker 1: And one of the metrics of performance they'd always look at is how much free RAM do they have?

898
00:44:28,598 --> 00:44:29,970
Speaker 0: Well, that was very important in those days.

899
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:32,510
Speaker 1: If they didn't have a lot of free RAM, they'd want to get some more.

900
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:36,735
Speaker 1: They'd complain about stuff using a lot of RAM, which was kind of legit because Windows didn't cache a lot.

901
00:44:37,177 --> 00:44:41,649
Speaker 1: If the RAM was used, it was usually being used by a program and you'd be hitting the swap because you never had enough RAM.

902
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:47,693
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the thing is if you run out of space, if you use all of your RAM, then you have a problem.

903
00:44:47,714 --> 00:44:54,130
Speaker 0: because what happens is the computers do a thing called paging to where all the things that are in memory are stored in pages like pages of a book.

904
00:44:54,471 --> 00:45:01,570
Speaker 0: And what will happen is it'll take pages if your RAM is full and it still needs to put more things in the RAM because it can't work directly off the disk.

905
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:02,979
Speaker 0: It has to work off, you know, has to.

906
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,211
Speaker 0: it can only follow instructions that are in the memory.

907
00:45:05,813 --> 00:45:14,210
Speaker 0: It'll actually take pages from memory, write those pages onto the hard drive and then read from the hard drive and put it in the new empty space.

908
00:45:14,571 --> 00:45:30,814
Speaker 0: And the thing is, sometimes what happens is if you have like two applications that are both working at the same time and there's no memory left, you'll get what's called thrashing to where it's constantly taking pages out of memory, putting them on the disk, taking pages off the disk, putting them into memory, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.

909
00:45:31,055 --> 00:45:39,611
Speaker 0: And you're at a RAM and it's using your hard drive like RAM and your computer slows to a crawl and your disk goes because it's thrashing all the time.

910
00:45:39,652 --> 00:45:41,789
Speaker 0: And that is bad if you're right out of RAM.

911
00:45:42,291 --> 00:45:44,950
Speaker 1: So, I look at my computer right now, you know, I'm recording Geek Nights right now.

912
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:45,371
Speaker 1: I got a bug.

913
00:45:45,391 --> 00:45:46,577
Speaker 1: I got Firefox open.

914
00:45:46,597 --> 00:45:49,310
Speaker 1: It's been open for like weeks doing stuff.

915
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:51,489
Speaker 1: And right now I got six gigs of RAM.

916
00:45:51,932 --> 00:45:52,417
Speaker 0: That's a lot.

917
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:53,610
Speaker 1: You know why I have six gigs?

918
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:56,589
Speaker 1: Because I have six DIMMs and I had to populate three.

919
00:45:58,151 --> 00:46:01,190
Speaker 1: So two gigabyte DIMMs were really the only thing I could get.

920
00:46:01,431 --> 00:46:04,574
Speaker 0: You weren't going to use one gig sticks because then you'd have three gigs, which isn't enough.

921
00:46:04,997 --> 00:46:06,630
Speaker 0: And four is about right, though.

922
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:07,909
Speaker 1: Now I'm thinking about getting more.

923
00:46:08,171 --> 00:46:08,949
Speaker 0: What do you need more for?

924
00:46:09,072 --> 00:46:09,929
Speaker 1: Well, video editing.

925
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:10,752
Speaker 0: Maybe.

926
00:46:10,872 --> 00:46:22,350
Speaker 1: But anyway, right now, recording Geek Nights with my FireWire and all this stuff, I got three gigs of RAM cached and about two gigs available, not even used.

927
00:46:24,552 --> 00:46:30,229
Speaker 1: And yet Firefox is using four hundred and eleven, four hundred and twelve, four hundred and thirteen, four hundred and fourteen megabytes.

928
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:30,691
Speaker 0: Yep.

929
00:46:31,195 --> 00:46:33,110
Speaker 0: And people are like, oh, my God, it's using so much.

930
00:46:33,191 --> 00:46:34,490
Speaker 0: And it's like, well, is it crashing?

931
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:35,075
Speaker 0: Well, no.

932
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,130
Speaker 1: Audition, meanwhile.

933
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:36,820
Speaker 0: Is it swapping?

934
00:46:36,942 --> 00:46:37,249
Speaker 0: Well, no.

935
00:46:37,471 --> 00:46:41,860
Speaker 1: Audition which is recording Geek Nights currently is using one hundred and eighty megabytes.

936
00:46:42,306 --> 00:46:42,550
Speaker 0: All right.

937
00:46:42,731 --> 00:46:44,049
Speaker 0: You know, it's back in the day.

938
00:46:44,191 --> 00:46:50,510
Speaker 0: You actually would have problems because you would try to play a game like, say, MEC Warrior 2 and it would use eight megabytes of RAM.

939
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:55,039
Speaker 0: So if you had an eight megabyte of RAM computer, you couldn't really do anything else at the same time.

940
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,130
Speaker 0: It would be quite troublesome.

941
00:46:56,350 --> 00:47:00,970
Speaker 1: Now, specifically with Firefox or Chrome or browsers, whatever browser people are complaining about where they say it's slow.

942
00:47:01,571 --> 00:47:02,236
Speaker 1: Usually it's not.

943
00:47:02,296 --> 00:47:04,290
Speaker 1: But forget that where they're saying it's using too much memory.

944
00:47:05,071 --> 00:47:08,390
Speaker 1: The browser for most users is 90 percent of what they do on the computer.

945
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:10,270
Speaker 1: The browser basically is their computer.

946
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:10,571
Speaker 0: Yeah.

947
00:47:10,651 --> 00:47:16,770
Speaker 0: And if you're if it's if you're using the browser for 90 percent of your work, then you should have no problem letting it use 90 percent of your RAM.

948
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:21,304
Speaker 1: You want it to use as much RAM as it can because that'll just make your browsing faster and easier.

949
00:47:21,324 --> 00:47:21,770
Speaker 0: Yeah.

950
00:47:21,931 --> 00:47:23,230
Speaker 0: I mean, what is what is it doing?

951
00:47:23,371 --> 00:47:24,296
Speaker 0: It's caching things.

952
00:47:24,376 --> 00:47:34,492
Speaker 0: It's remembering things that it downloaded from the Internet and holding them in RAM so that if you if you need them again, that it'll be able to get them very quickly and it won't have to go back home to get your dentist card again.

953
00:47:34,593 --> 00:47:37,410
Speaker 0: If you go back to that website again, that's all it's doing.

954
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:39,370
Speaker 0: And who cares if it's using memory?

955
00:47:39,491 --> 00:47:41,930
Speaker 0: It doesn't hurt you unless you run out of memory.

956
00:47:42,352 --> 00:47:42,633
Speaker 0: And it's.

957
00:47:42,855 --> 00:47:45,953
Speaker 0: and the thing is, it's smart enough to look at how much memory you have free.

958
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:46,698
Speaker 0: Right.

959
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:48,350
Speaker 0: So that it doesn't use all your memory.

960
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:49,182
Speaker 0: It's not stupid.

961
00:47:49,202 --> 00:47:49,670
Speaker 0: Right.

962
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:52,550
Speaker 0: It's not going to be like, oh, look, we're using all the memory.

963
00:47:53,013 --> 00:47:54,630
Speaker 0: You know, I guess we should use even more.

964
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,098
Speaker 0: It's not stupid.

965
00:47:56,118 --> 00:47:57,430
Speaker 0: It goes, oh, shit, we're out of memory.

966
00:47:58,631 --> 00:47:59,013
Speaker 0: Let's see.

967
00:47:59,094 --> 00:48:01,670
Speaker 0: Are we using this card more often or this card more often?

968
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:05,274
Speaker 0: Well, let's take the most often used card, keep it in the wallet and get rid of the other one.

969
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:06,850
Speaker 0: It's not dumb, right?

970
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:11,451
Speaker 0: It's not going to make you swap unless there is absolutely no card that it can get rid of.

971
00:48:11,511 --> 00:48:14,750
Speaker 1: Now, many people might say, but but but what about my phone?

972
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:15,351
Speaker 1: Yeah.

973
00:48:15,391 --> 00:48:21,990
Speaker 1: You write a special browser that handles, you know, memory management is very different on a compact device or device where power usage matters.

974
00:48:23,292 --> 00:48:28,393
Speaker 0: The other thing is that there are programs out there that have what are called memory leaks.

975
00:48:28,917 --> 00:48:29,158
Speaker 0: Right.

976
00:48:29,219 --> 00:48:30,750
Speaker 0: And this is this is kind of a situation.

977
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:30,951
Speaker 0: Right.

978
00:48:30,971 --> 00:48:38,750
Speaker 0: When you're writing a program, if you're writing in Java or Python or something like that, there is an automatic system called a garbage collector.

979
00:48:38,951 --> 00:48:43,393
Speaker 0: And what this does is, you know, as you're programming, you're making a variable, putting it in memory.

980
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,690
Speaker 0: You're using it and then maybe you don't need it anymore.

981
00:48:46,851 --> 00:48:49,190
Speaker 0: And you go on to use some other variables or some objects.

982
00:48:49,331 --> 00:48:49,552
Speaker 0: Right.

983
00:48:49,592 --> 00:48:52,891
Speaker 0: And maybe you load some data from a database, use it, and then you don't need it anymore.

984
00:48:53,353 --> 00:48:57,470
Speaker 0: Well, if you're writing in Java or Python or any garbage collected language.

985
00:48:57,751 --> 00:48:57,993
Speaker 0: Right.

986
00:48:58,275 --> 00:49:00,470
Speaker 0: Those things that you don't need anymore that are in memory.

987
00:49:00,911 --> 00:49:04,890
Speaker 0: Will slowly but surely be removed from memory by the garbage collector.

988
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:05,712
Speaker 0: Right.

989
00:49:05,732 --> 00:49:10,556
Speaker 0: So that, you know, your program, you know, won't, you know, slowly grow and grow and grow for no reason.

990
00:49:10,576 --> 00:49:13,030
Speaker 0: It'll only grow as far as it needs to grow.

991
00:49:13,311 --> 00:49:13,593
Speaker 0: Right.

992
00:49:13,633 --> 00:49:16,370
Speaker 0: You know, you won't be like, oh, here's a card that I'm going to use once.

993
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:21,142
Speaker 0: There's a one used metro card and I'm going to leave that one used metro card in my wallet forever, even though I used it once already.

994
00:49:21,464 --> 00:49:22,330
Speaker 0: that it doesn't do that.

995
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:22,694
Speaker 0: It's not.

996
00:49:22,755 --> 00:49:23,609
Speaker 0: it's smart enough not to.

997
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:36,450
Speaker 0: But if you write a program and say C, C++, Objective C, some sort of non garbage collected compiled language, you as the program or when you're writing this program need to manually manage the memory.

998
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:42,393
Speaker 0: You need to specifically code, you know, take this data, put it in the memory, do a bunch of stuff.

999
00:49:42,514 --> 00:49:45,650
Speaker 0: Now take that data and remove it from the memory.

1000
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:47,550
Speaker 0: You need to actually code that specific thing.

1001
00:49:48,012 --> 00:49:48,213
Speaker 0: Right.

1002
00:49:48,294 --> 00:49:50,650
Speaker 0: In Java, you don't need to ever say remove that from the memory.

1003
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:52,389
Speaker 0: You can now, but you don't want to.

1004
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:57,070
Speaker 1: At the same time, many, many Java written applications have huge memory leaks.

1005
00:49:57,271 --> 00:49:59,090
Speaker 0: Well, that's a that's a different problem altogether.

1006
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:05,409
Speaker 1: Well, that's just due to the fact that people effectively will leave objects open in a context where they could still be used.

1007
00:50:05,832 --> 00:50:06,034
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1008
00:50:06,175 --> 00:50:07,850
Speaker 1: And thus will never be garbage collected.

1009
00:50:08,331 --> 00:50:13,672
Speaker 1: And thus through every iteration of a loop, a new object, object, object, object, object, object.

1010
00:50:13,792 --> 00:50:23,309
Speaker 0: It is possible to make a memory leak in a garbage collected environment, but it is more common that it will happen in a non garbage collecting environment regardless because you're relying on fallible humans.

1011
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:23,750
Speaker 0: Yes.

1012
00:50:23,831 --> 00:50:31,150
Speaker 0: It is possible to write a program that will just fill up the memory slowly but surely with stuff that is not needed in the memory.

1013
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:37,609
Speaker 0: And then what will happen is your whole computer will slow to a crawl once it runs out of memory and can't remove anything from the memory.

1014
00:50:37,871 --> 00:50:40,310
Speaker 0: What's interesting is because the program is written poorly.

1015
00:50:40,731 --> 00:50:42,139
Speaker 1: What's interesting is a lot of people.

1016
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:43,770
Speaker 1: this is kind of a more technical aside.

1017
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:46,770
Speaker 1: Windows and Linux handle the situation very differently.

1018
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:55,290
Speaker 1: And I realized looking at the Internet for some unrelated thing that many people have encountered something scary in the Linux world.

1019
00:50:55,732 --> 00:51:00,490
Speaker 1: They'll be using their computer and it slows down and suddenly shit starts crashing.

1020
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:01,010
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1021
00:51:01,192 --> 00:51:04,270
Speaker 1: And they look in varlog messages or usually they didn't configure logging.

1022
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:04,570
Speaker 1: Right.

1023
00:51:04,872 --> 00:51:09,210
Speaker 1: So the console starts writing this line OOM killer invoked.

1024
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:09,771
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1025
00:51:09,892 --> 00:51:14,973
Speaker 0: So Linux in the kernel has a thing called the OOM killer out of memory, the out of memory killer.

1026
00:51:15,014 --> 00:51:22,850
Speaker 0: And what it does is when your computer runs out of memory and runs out of swap space so it can't even do the page thrashing to the disk anymore.

1027
00:51:23,214 --> 00:51:24,630
Speaker 0: It is literally out of memory.

1028
00:51:24,751 --> 00:51:26,209
Speaker 0: It usually has nowhere to go.

1029
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:36,590
Speaker 1: Usually happens when you've got an application that is crashing in such a way, which is actually fairly common, especially with demons that are poorly written or that do something very intensive like market data handlers.

1030
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:39,810
Speaker 0: Or someone has like an infinite fork loop that they wrote in a bash.

1031
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:42,570
Speaker 1: They'll get out of control and just fill the RAM in the space of a second.

1032
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:42,930
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1033
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:48,210
Speaker 0: What Linux will do is it will based on priorities, this prioritizing algorithm.

1034
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:49,890
Speaker 1: It's semi random in some cases.

1035
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:50,374
Speaker 0: Semi.

1036
00:51:50,395 --> 00:51:50,889
Speaker 0: It depends.

1037
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:51,172
Speaker 0: Right.

1038
00:51:51,192 --> 00:51:52,110
Speaker 0: You can go look up the algorithm.

1039
00:51:52,171 --> 00:51:53,290
Speaker 1: I don't even know the algorithm.

1040
00:51:53,391 --> 00:51:55,090
Speaker 0: It will pick a process.

1041
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:58,170
Speaker 0: It'll pick something that is using memory and kill it.

1042
00:51:58,290 --> 00:52:07,950
Speaker 0: So let's say you've got Firefox and Apache server and an instant message client and an evil thing and my SQL server.

1043
00:52:08,171 --> 00:52:10,269
Speaker 1: Never mind the million other things that are running in the back.

1044
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:10,552
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1045
00:52:10,573 --> 00:52:11,230
Speaker 0: And they're all running.

1046
00:52:11,592 --> 00:52:11,814
Speaker 0: Right.

1047
00:52:11,854 --> 00:52:13,710
Speaker 0: And suddenly your computer runs out of memory.

1048
00:52:13,911 --> 00:52:14,153
Speaker 0: Right.

1049
00:52:14,374 --> 00:52:16,910
Speaker 0: The Linux kernel will be just like my SQL.

1050
00:52:17,652 --> 00:52:18,257
Speaker 0: I pick you.

1051
00:52:18,479 --> 00:52:19,869
Speaker 0: You are now gone and it just kills it.

1052
00:52:20,293 --> 00:52:22,030
Speaker 0: And now suddenly there's a whole bunch of free memory.

1053
00:52:22,131 --> 00:52:24,070
Speaker 0: The Linux kernel basically just reaches into your wallet.

1054
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:26,810
Speaker 0: It's like we were out of room in this wallet for more cards.

1055
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,930
Speaker 0: And I have a card that has to go in the wallet.

1056
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:31,849
Speaker 0: Well, I'm picking a card out of the wallet and I'm throwing it in the shredder.

1057
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:34,790
Speaker 0: And now we've got cards are all in place again.

1058
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:37,370
Speaker 1: Now, the thing is, very rarely will the O.M.

1059
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:43,329
Speaker 1: killer save you because usually it kills something that you wanted to be running or even if it kills stuff you didn't want.

1060
00:52:43,611 --> 00:52:45,810
Speaker 1: Whatever went crazy is like, oh, more RAM.

1061
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:47,099
Speaker 0: Yeah, goodie.

1062
00:52:47,321 --> 00:52:48,189
Speaker 0: But the thing is, the O.M.

1063
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:50,430
Speaker 0: killer probably will eventually kill the evil thing.

1064
00:52:50,511 --> 00:52:53,310
Speaker 0: But the thing is, the evil thing is usually something that you want running.

1065
00:52:53,771 --> 00:52:53,912
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1066
00:52:53,932 --> 00:52:56,345
Speaker 0: So pretty much no matter what, you're going to be either.

1067
00:52:56,426 --> 00:52:57,732
Speaker 0: your computer will keep working.

1068
00:52:57,873 --> 00:52:58,074
Speaker 0: Right.

1069
00:52:58,114 --> 00:52:58,556
Speaker 0: And you'll.

1070
00:52:58,898 --> 00:53:05,993
Speaker 0: you'll be able to fix it because the computer will have free memory to be able to connect to it and log in and enter commands to solve the problem, which is great.

1071
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:09,451
Speaker 0: The problem is, is something that you wanted to keep running is now not running.

1072
00:53:09,472 --> 00:53:12,590
Speaker 1: Well, the two cases I've run into primarily with the O.M.

1073
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:18,448
Speaker 1: killer and my advice to all of you, a lot of people Google on the Internet looking for what do I do to recover from the O.M.

1074
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:18,995
Speaker 1: killer?

1075
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:19,684
Speaker 1: You know what?

1076
00:53:19,745 --> 00:53:20,090
Speaker 1: Reboot.

1077
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:26,234
Speaker 1: That's usually the only safe way because you don't know what it killed and you don't know how it killed it.

1078
00:53:26,254 --> 00:53:31,410
Speaker 0: It might if it killed it with kill dash nine, that program might have ended in a weird state, especially if it was like a database.

1079
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:32,930
Speaker 1: I mean, you want to recover manually.

1080
00:53:33,231 --> 00:53:33,512
Speaker 1: All right.

1081
00:53:33,572 --> 00:53:41,469
Speaker 1: Dig through VAR log messages and figure out what it killed in what order and then run an LSOF to figure out what files are still being held open by zombie processes.

1082
00:53:41,912 --> 00:53:42,869
Speaker 0: Yes, a lot of ways.

1083
00:53:43,331 --> 00:53:44,177
Speaker 1: Basically, you got to reboot.

1084
00:53:44,197 --> 00:53:45,889
Speaker 1: But to usually when I see O.M.

1085
00:53:46,452 --> 00:53:53,070
Speaker 1: killer invoked and it didn't somehow kill the bad process, it'll end up getting to a knit and then your machine's done.

1086
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:53,671
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1087
00:53:53,691 --> 00:53:55,809
Speaker 1: And then you have to reboot because there's literally nothing you can do.

1088
00:53:56,331 --> 00:53:56,654
Speaker 1: Right.

1089
00:53:56,674 --> 00:53:58,290
Speaker 0: Windows, on the other hand, basically just goes.

1090
00:53:59,391 --> 00:53:59,592
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1091
00:53:59,612 --> 00:54:04,390
Speaker 1: Windows, even Windows servers for just sits there forever.

1092
00:54:04,851 --> 00:54:05,414
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

1093
00:54:05,896 --> 00:54:10,497
Speaker 0: And there's you have to just like hard rebooted yet to push the reset button because it just it just will.

1094
00:54:10,517 --> 00:54:12,870
Speaker 1: just it'll try guys out there.

1095
00:54:13,771 --> 00:54:19,511
Speaker 1: If you have to physically touch a machine to reboot it, oh, my, my machine did it pretty much.

1096
00:54:20,033 --> 00:54:25,933
Speaker 1: You should have some sort of RAT card, open manage, at least whatever, at the least KVF.

1097
00:54:26,014 --> 00:54:26,255
Speaker 0: Yep.

1098
00:54:26,637 --> 00:54:28,909
Speaker 1: Got to have something to remotely reboot shit.

1099
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:33,754
Speaker 0: Yeah, physically, especially if you're in a data center, because there's no way you're going to go down there.

1100
00:54:33,774 --> 00:54:38,655
Speaker 0: Yeah, dude, walk, walk, find the machine that's probably labeled with some numbers.

1101
00:54:38,937 --> 00:54:41,633
Speaker 0: Look up in a book to figure out which numbers match up to which machine.

1102
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:44,570
Speaker 1: I think that's about all.

1103
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:52,070
Speaker 1: I mean, really, we just wanted to kind of cover memory, mostly because I want to end the stupid debate about memory usage and memory leaks and fire in browsers.

1104
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:52,814
Speaker 0: I do want to talk.

1105
00:54:52,854 --> 00:54:55,646
Speaker 0: I do want to spend like two minutes, though, talking about how different memories work.

1106
00:54:55,768 --> 00:54:55,910
Speaker 0: Right.

1107
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:59,490
Speaker 0: So the registers in the CPU, those are flip flops.

1108
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:01,530
Speaker 0: If you want to know what a flip flop is, look it up.

1109
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:02,583
Speaker 1: We did a show on that.

1110
00:55:02,726 --> 00:55:02,970
Speaker 0: We did.

1111
00:55:03,371 --> 00:55:03,612
Speaker 0: Right.

1112
00:55:03,693 --> 00:55:06,430
Speaker 0: So the memory that's in your RAM, the SDRAM.

1113
00:55:06,673 --> 00:55:06,897
Speaker 0: Right.

1114
00:55:06,937 --> 00:55:07,649
Speaker 0: You know how that works?

1115
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:10,549
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually, I took a class on that at RIT.

1116
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:11,569
Speaker 0: So do you know how it works?

1117
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:14,010
Speaker 1: Well, let's see.

1118
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:14,942
Speaker 1: You want me to actually explain?

1119
00:55:14,962 --> 00:55:15,490
Speaker 1: I'm trying to remember.

1120
00:55:16,032 --> 00:55:16,416
Speaker 1: Pretty much.

1121
00:55:16,437 --> 00:55:17,550
Speaker 0: I don't think you know how it works.

1122
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:18,420
Speaker 1: Isn't it capacitative?

1123
00:55:18,765 --> 00:55:19,029
Speaker 0: It is.

1124
00:55:19,632 --> 00:55:24,490
Speaker 0: It is a grid of capacitors, basically really tiny capacitors and a whole lot of them.

1125
00:55:24,852 --> 00:55:26,430
Speaker 0: And the computer will charge them up.

1126
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:29,010
Speaker 0: And, you know, a capacitor is like a little temporary battery.

1127
00:55:29,111 --> 00:55:31,290
Speaker 0: So if it's holding a charge, that's a one.

1128
00:55:31,371 --> 00:55:33,109
Speaker 0: And if it and then it lets the charge go.

1129
00:55:33,493 --> 00:55:34,910
Speaker 0: And now that capacitor is a zero.

1130
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:39,955
Speaker 0: So it's a grid of a zillion capacitors and it can charge, it can charge them up and discharge them.

1131
00:55:40,056 --> 00:55:41,810
Speaker 0: And that is how it's ones and zeros.

1132
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:51,630
Speaker 0: But obviously, if the computer turns off, you lose all the memory in RAM because all the capacitors empty out, just like, you know, if you turn the computer off, all the flip flops go to zero.

1133
00:55:51,810 --> 00:56:00,150
Speaker 1: OK, because basically what I was worried is that you were going for the more specific answer about like dynamic versus static, whether or not refresh intervals.

1134
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:01,650
Speaker 0: That is too advanced for these people.

1135
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:02,970
Speaker 1: That is why I was equivocating.

1136
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:06,110
Speaker 0: But that is also why there are security vulnerabilities.

1137
00:56:06,391 --> 00:56:06,592
Speaker 0: Right.

1138
00:56:06,673 --> 00:56:14,650
Speaker 0: Where you can actually turn a computer off, take the RAM stick out really quick and read the memory out of it because the capacitors don't drain instantly.

1139
00:56:15,231 --> 00:56:15,412
Speaker 0: Right.

1140
00:56:15,453 --> 00:56:23,050
Speaker 0: There were some security vulnerabilities where people were extracting hard drive encryption, disk encryption, using liquid nitrogen to cool RAM.

1141
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:26,570
Speaker 0: And they would cool the RAM with liquid nitrogen, pull the stick out.

1142
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:29,430
Speaker 0: The capacitors would still be holding their charge because they were so cold.

1143
00:56:29,732 --> 00:56:31,730
Speaker 0: And then they would read the memory really quickly.

1144
00:56:31,851 --> 00:56:33,050
Speaker 0: But of course, you have physical access.

1145
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:33,917
Speaker 0: You have everything anyway.

1146
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:35,670
Speaker 0: So it's kind of it's just a fun proof of concept.

1147
00:56:36,391 --> 00:56:43,290
Speaker 1: You know, where it would be useful if people, especially, you know, a terrorist or a financial person who needed to get away with something, did our strategy.

1148
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:46,021
Speaker 1: Laptop, boot CD, RAM only.

1149
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:49,655
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1150
00:56:49,775 --> 00:56:51,741
Speaker 0: There's also Biosis based.

1151
00:56:51,761 --> 00:56:54,890
Speaker 0: CMOS is basically like a circuit breaker, right?

1152
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:58,475
Speaker 0: It's a whole bunch of just like the circuit breaker in your basement, only much smaller.

1153
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:00,090
Speaker 0: And that's how that works.

1154
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:03,068
Speaker 0: It's basically if the breakers are turned to the one way, it's zero.

1155
00:57:03,451 --> 00:57:04,507
Speaker 0: And if they're turned the other way, it's one.

1156
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:10,610
Speaker 0: And those right, the circuit breaker switches in your basement, they don't move around unless the fuse gets tripped.

1157
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:11,692
Speaker 0: Right.

1158
00:57:11,712 --> 00:57:17,950
Speaker 0: So, you know, and in a in on a bios, right, the fuse is only tripped manually.

1159
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:19,890
Speaker 0: It's not you know, it's not hooked up to a fuse.

1160
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:22,990
Speaker 0: It's hooked up to a manual flash device.

1161
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:26,169
Speaker 0: So you basically you're manually controlling which way the switches go.

1162
00:57:26,992 --> 00:57:30,550
Speaker 0: So, you know, you put something in that memory, it's there forever.

1163
00:57:31,033 --> 00:57:33,130
Speaker 0: You know, and a hard drive is a magnetic disk.

1164
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:38,530
Speaker 0: You know, it sets the different little spots on the disk to be zero or one by turning the magnets around.

1165
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:41,166
Speaker 1: Now, you might talk about a solid state disk flash memory.

1166
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:44,890
Speaker 1: It's just flash memory and a hard drive form factor with better logic.

1167
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:45,371
Speaker 0: Yep.

1168
00:57:45,902 --> 00:57:46,229
Speaker 0: That's it.

1169
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:47,430
Speaker 0: Flash memory is weird.

1170
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:48,530
Speaker 1: What about ferrite core?

1171
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:50,670
Speaker 0: That's that's also a magnet.

1172
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:55,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of a lot of the other kinds of memory, just magnets like tape is magnets.

1173
00:57:56,150 --> 00:58:05,490
Speaker 0: You know, there are some physical memory storage formats like abacus, abacus, you know, gears, you know, marbles and slots.

1174
00:58:06,633 --> 00:58:06,753
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1175
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:18,628
Speaker 1: I've made a fairly complex binary computer out of marbles in slots with flip flop switches to not technically cheat, but to technically completely win a Science Olympiad competition.

1176
00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:21,930
Speaker 0: This physical switches, you just turn the switch left or right like a relay.

1177
00:58:22,191 --> 00:58:22,412
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1178
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:26,410
Speaker 0: You know, there's all kinds of ways to store a zero or a one.

1179
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:34,356
Speaker 0: But the ones in your computer are mostly flip flops, magnets, flash and grid of capacitors.

1180
00:58:34,517 --> 00:58:35,749
Speaker 0: Those are those are the biggest ones.

1181
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:39,690
Speaker 1: But really, look at your RAM usage and look at it for real.

1182
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:40,669
Speaker 0: Don't look at your RAM.

1183
00:58:40,992 --> 00:58:41,748
Speaker 1: You look at it to know.

1184
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:44,590
Speaker 1: Make sure that you're you've got a big set of cash.

1185
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:45,650
Speaker 1: Don't look for free memory.

1186
00:58:45,972 --> 00:58:47,169
Speaker 1: Look for memory that's cashed.

1187
00:58:47,632 --> 00:58:50,650
Speaker 1: And if you have none, if it's all being used legit.

1188
00:58:51,355 --> 00:58:51,518
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1189
00:58:51,538 --> 00:58:52,109
Speaker 1: You need more RAM.

1190
00:58:52,331 --> 00:58:58,070
Speaker 1: And yeah, and but lack of RAM is almost never the cause of your problem.

1191
00:58:58,150 --> 00:59:01,930
Speaker 0: If you see a program using a lot of RAM, just completely ignore it.

1192
00:59:02,031 --> 00:59:03,009
Speaker 0: I mean, dude, a big deal.

1193
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:03,987
Speaker 1: I edit HD.

1194
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:05,281
Speaker 1: I did it an hour of 1080p.

1195
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:07,036
Speaker 1: And you know what?

1196
00:59:07,358 --> 00:59:09,330
Speaker 1: Six gigs of RAM was plenty.

1197
00:59:09,931 --> 00:59:10,072
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1198
00:59:10,172 --> 00:59:15,214
Speaker 0: Unless you are running out of RAM, like your disk is thrashing, just completely ignore.

1199
00:59:15,274 --> 00:59:17,350
Speaker 0: Who cares if Firefox is using six hundred megabytes?

1200
00:59:17,552 --> 00:59:19,470
Speaker 0: It's only making Firefox faster.

1201
00:59:20,094 --> 00:59:21,330
Speaker 0: It's not a problem.

1202
00:59:21,676 --> 00:59:22,550
Speaker 0: It's not an issue.

1203
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:28,610
Speaker 0: As some other program that uses 20 megabytes is probably poorly written because it's not caching anything.

1204
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:36,290
Speaker 1: As an aside, if you think that your browser is using way too much RAM or it's growing as a memory leak, odds are it doesn't.

1205
00:59:36,430 --> 00:59:39,930
Speaker 1: And some shitty add on that you installed is, in fact, the cause of the problem.

1206
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:42,370
Speaker 0: That can be possible as long as your disk isn't thrashing.

1207
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:44,610
Speaker 0: Just ignore how much memory is being used.

1208
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:54,292
Speaker 0: However, one thing you should be aware of is that when using many programs at once, you might just have to close something like if you want to play a 3D game that's incredibly advanced,

1209
00:59:54,653 --> 00:59:54,714
Speaker 1: it

1210
00:59:54,794 --> 01:00:06,349
Speaker 0: might need like two gigs plus of RAM to hold all those textures and all that other kinds of stuff, especially if your video card doesn't have enough memory to hold all the textures in it, because that's what video card memory is used for, holding textures.

1211
01:00:07,991 --> 01:00:10,421
Speaker 0: Your PCI Express or your AGP slot will.

1212
01:00:10,461 --> 01:00:13,829
Speaker 0: you will actually store some of the textures in your regular RAM.

1213
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:17,590
Speaker 0: So if you you know, you might end up using tons of RAM when playing a game.

1214
01:00:18,012 --> 01:00:27,029
Speaker 0: So maybe if you don't have a lot of RAM, maybe you only have two gigs, you know, and your video card only has half a gig, you might want to close your browser before you play a game and you'll be fine.

1215
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:32,048
Speaker 1: And if you're buying a computer, building a computer, buying RAM, pretty much how many DIMMs do you have?

1216
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:39,541
Speaker 1: And then look at the instruction book, put in the minimum number of DIMMs to get whatever interleaving or whatever set up is.

1217
01:00:39,601 --> 01:00:40,970
Speaker 0: some computers have dual.

1218
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:42,198
Speaker 0: What's it called?

1219
01:00:42,259 --> 01:00:42,870
Speaker 0: Dual, whatever.

1220
01:00:42,991 --> 01:00:44,710
Speaker 0: And some have triple like mine has triple.

1221
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:45,536
Speaker 1: I have six DIMMs.

1222
01:00:45,657 --> 01:00:47,350
Speaker 1: I got to fill at least three to have optimal.

1223
01:00:47,572 --> 01:00:47,733
Speaker 0: Yes.

1224
01:00:47,773 --> 01:00:49,890
Speaker 0: He has to buy three sticks of RAM for that computer.

1225
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:56,089
Speaker 0: My computer, you need to buy two sticks and putting them in alternating slots, pretty much get four gigs of RAM or six gigs of RAM.

1226
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:57,550
Speaker 0: RAM is so cheap.

1227
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:58,990
Speaker 0: There's no reason not to get a ton of it.

1228
01:00:59,171 --> 01:01:04,750
Speaker 0: And if your computer has so even if you have a crappy net book or something, right, a RAM upgrade is ridiculously inexpensive.

1229
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:09,835
Speaker 0: So if you are running out, let's say you have a gig of RAM in a net book and Firefox is using five hundred.

1230
01:01:10,137 --> 01:01:12,210
Speaker 0: Well, it's not Firefox's fault for using five hundred.

1231
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:12,999
Speaker 0: It's totally fine.

1232
01:01:13,263 --> 01:01:13,770
Speaker 0: It's your fault.

1233
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:15,769
Speaker 0: It's your fault for having one gig.

1234
01:01:16,071 --> 01:01:19,791
Speaker 0: So go and buy a two or a four gig stick and put it in that net book and it'll be so awesome.

1235
01:01:20,233 --> 01:01:28,050
Speaker 1: There is the side topic of RAM disks, which are not as commonly used in the modern era because we have solid state disks and just because we have tons of RAM.

1236
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:28,672
Speaker 0: That's true.

1237
01:01:29,013 --> 01:01:33,730
Speaker 1: But there was a time I once made a RAM disk and installed Doom onto it.

1238
01:01:34,071 --> 01:01:38,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically what some people do, if you have so much RAM that you've got a whole bunch of extra, you don't even know what to do with it.

1239
01:01:38,972 --> 01:01:40,650
Speaker 0: Let's say my computer had 20 gigs of RAM.

1240
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:42,889
Speaker 0: It's like, well, obviously I'm not even using four.

1241
01:01:43,211 --> 01:01:44,511
Speaker 0: So what the fuck am I going to do with 20?

1242
01:01:44,511 --> 01:01:46,770
Speaker 0: Well, I could make a disk in RAM.

1243
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:47,131
Speaker 0: Right.

1244
01:01:47,151 --> 01:01:50,270
Speaker 0: So the computer treats, thinks it has a new hard disk like E colon.

1245
01:01:50,712 --> 01:01:52,589
Speaker 0: But really, it's RAM that's being used.

1246
01:01:53,031 --> 01:01:53,313
Speaker 0: Right.

1247
01:01:53,836 --> 01:01:56,370
Speaker 0: Which means when the computer turns off, that disk is going to be erased.

1248
01:01:56,850 --> 01:01:58,570
Speaker 1: So I installed Firefox there.

1249
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:03,530
Speaker 0: I can install a program into that RAM and now that program will load extremely quickly.

1250
01:02:04,311 --> 01:02:09,770
Speaker 1: So on boot, let's say I have a program that gets installed into this drive and runs.

1251
01:02:09,951 --> 01:02:10,476
Speaker 1: It doesn't know.

1252
01:02:10,496 --> 01:02:12,030
Speaker 1: You don't have to do anything special in the program.

1253
01:02:12,554 --> 01:02:14,170
Speaker 1: And yet you'll get crazy performance.

1254
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:15,270
Speaker 1: It's just completely volatile.

1255
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:24,474
Speaker 0: Or if you're working, you're editing a video or if you're editing a very large Photoshop file, right, you could save it into that RAM disk and then it'll be very quick to save and load that file.

1256
01:02:24,535 --> 01:02:26,990
Speaker 0: As long as the computer doesn't turn off or what, it'll be safe.

1257
01:02:27,170 --> 01:02:30,848
Speaker 0: And then what you could do is you would copy that file to your actual regular disk.

1258
01:02:31,048 --> 01:02:34,510
Speaker 0: that's safe every once in a while so that you don't lose your information.

1259
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:39,971
Speaker 1: My current computer, I put the operating system windows on a 32 gigabyte solid state drive.

1260
01:02:40,172 --> 01:02:40,333
Speaker 0: Yep.

1261
01:02:40,694 --> 01:02:44,993
Speaker 1: And everything else is I'm slow as seventy two hundred RPM, a half terabyte drive.

1262
01:02:45,013 --> 01:02:47,370
Speaker 0: And as a result, the computer boots very, very quickly.

1263
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:51,830
Speaker 1: My computer boots faster than I'm trying to think of something.

1264
01:02:52,012 --> 01:02:52,729
Speaker 1: It's like 10 seconds.

1265
01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:53,574
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's really fast.

1266
01:02:53,654 --> 01:03:01,769
Speaker 0: And, you know, many common operations, because the most commonly accessed files, the operating system files in the windows folder, it's going to are going to happen very, very quickly.

1267
01:03:02,151 --> 01:03:07,372
Speaker 0: But all the things that you don't do so often, like how often do you open up a game once a day?

1268
01:03:07,412 --> 01:03:13,264
Speaker 1: Not even that, like most of my media is on the NAS over the network on the gigabit ethernet because I don't.

1269
01:03:14,032 --> 01:03:15,570
Speaker 0: But it's gigabit ethernet is pretty fast.

1270
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:15,911
Speaker 0: It is.

1271
01:03:15,931 --> 01:03:18,510
Speaker 0: I mean, a serial ATA drive is three gigabit per second.

1272
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:19,710
Speaker 0: So gigabit ethernet is one.

1273
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:23,813
Speaker 1: We could stream stuff off of our computers upstairs and that hundred megabit and it was fine.

1274
01:03:23,853 --> 01:03:26,210
Speaker 0: You should see me streaming over my gigabit at home.

1275
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:26,570
Speaker 0: Right.

1276
01:03:26,771 --> 01:03:33,749
Speaker 0: It's it's one gigabit is fast enough to get filed music and video files, you know, maybe not fast enough to run a counter strike.

1277
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:35,849
Speaker 0: You don't want to stall counter strike on the NAS.

1278
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:36,310
Speaker 0: That's stupid.

1279
01:03:42,538 --> 01:03:44,680
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1280
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:49,983
