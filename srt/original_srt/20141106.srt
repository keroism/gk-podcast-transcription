1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,959
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, November 6th, 2014.

2
00:00:09,959 --> 00:00:10,180
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:13,070
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,496
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,737 --> 00:00:17,410
Speaker 0: I'm back from Australia and we're back from hiatus.

6
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:21,810
Speaker 0: Tonight, we're talking about the election that you probably didn't vote in.

7
00:00:23,851 --> 00:00:24,848
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

8
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:29,459
Speaker 0: Oh my gosh, I'm back.

9
00:00:29,499 --> 00:00:30,990
Speaker 0: We've missed a lot of Geek Nights.

10
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:33,160
Speaker 0: I was feeling pretty good yesterday.

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,670
Speaker 0: I landed on Tuesday night.

12
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,830
Speaker 0: I went to work on Wednesday, just like a boss.

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,310
Speaker 0: And today, I think I have a PaxBox.

14
00:00:41,151 --> 00:00:43,490
Speaker 1: Oh, why did you call me over here if you had a PaxBox?

15
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:44,556
Speaker 0: Just don't touch me.

16
00:00:44,576 --> 00:00:46,050
Speaker 0: It feels like one of those sinus-y kind of things.

17
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,006
Speaker 0: So just stay away from me.

18
00:00:48,313 --> 00:00:48,899
Speaker 0: I feel pretty good.

19
00:00:48,919 --> 00:00:49,990
Speaker 0: Just, you know, the usual sore throat.

20
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,689
Speaker 0: I'm going to mute Snaxit up and get a good night's sleep.

21
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:52,840
Speaker 1: Great.

22
00:00:55,012 --> 00:00:56,089
Speaker 1: Apparently, there is no term limit.

23
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:57,755
Speaker 0: Yeah, no term limits.

24
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,790
Speaker 0: Meaning Clobo's going to keep running until he dies.

25
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:03,470
Speaker 1: I've never heard of anyone being governor for more than eight years anyway.

26
00:01:03,792 --> 00:01:05,108
Speaker 0: How many governors can you name?

27
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,128
Speaker 1: Quite a few.

28
00:01:07,431 --> 00:01:07,713
Speaker 0: Alright.

29
00:01:08,055 --> 00:01:08,578
Speaker 0: So yeah, anyway.

30
00:01:08,598 --> 00:01:09,182
Speaker 0: It's the lounge.

31
00:01:09,283 --> 00:01:10,068
Speaker 0: It's Thursday on Geek Nights.

32
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,296
Speaker 0: No, it's not the lounge.

33
00:01:11,316 --> 00:01:12,805
Speaker 1: This is actually a Monday-Wednesday week.

34
00:01:12,825 --> 00:01:13,630
Speaker 1: This is a special.

35
00:01:14,693 --> 00:01:16,450
Speaker 0: Wow, we haven't done a special in a long time.

36
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:17,881
Speaker 1: This is not a lounge.

37
00:01:17,921 --> 00:01:18,929
Speaker 1: Get your lounge out of my face.

38
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,258
Speaker 0: It's only the lounge.

39
00:01:20,278 --> 00:01:22,130
Speaker 0: if it's a normal episode on a Thursday, then.

40
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,275
Speaker 1: It's never the lounge.

41
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:26,450
Speaker 1: I'll find an excuse then, too, but I found an excuse today was easier.

42
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:44,349
Speaker 0: For those of you who found out about Geek Nights because of Pax Australia, which I seem to believe is a lot of people based on the number of Twitter followers I got and the surprising number of emails I got from people who had questions about the panel, yeah, this is Geek Nights, and we'll talk about Pax on Tuesday next week.

43
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:45,954
Speaker 0: That's gaming night.

44
00:01:45,994 --> 00:01:49,628
Speaker 0: Tonight's Thursday, so we're talking about whatever.

45
00:01:49,669 --> 00:01:50,030
Speaker 0: My butt.

46
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:57,210
Speaker 1: Stuff that Australians could care absolutely nothing about, because they're on the other side of the world, and this is pretty much a New York issue.

47
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,508
Speaker 0: So, last year...

48
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,016
Speaker 1: But it's okay to do a New York issue.

49
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:03,350
Speaker 1: It legitimizes my registration of the geeknights.nyc domain.

50
00:02:03,531 --> 00:02:04,516
Speaker 0: That, in fact, is true.

51
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:13,990
Speaker 0: So, last year, Scott and I went to Pax Australia, but it was summer here, and we went in Australia's winter, meaning we lost two weeks of summer.

52
00:02:14,153 --> 00:02:14,489
Speaker 1: It sucked.

53
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:21,870
Speaker 0: This year, I went in the fall, and it was summer there, so I got bonus summer, thus canceling that out.

54
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:23,630
Speaker 1: That would have been amazing.

55
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,289
Speaker 0: And my impressions on summer Australia are such.

56
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:29,090
Speaker 0: To keep it relatively brief.

57
00:02:29,551 --> 00:02:30,554
Speaker 0: Not talking about Pax at all.

58
00:02:30,694 --> 00:02:35,290
Speaker 0: One, Sydney is way different from Melbourne, and a lot like New York.

59
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:48,190
Speaker 0: However, imagine if New York had a beach that was 100 times better than the beach at Wildwood, and was literally 20 minutes via cheap mass transit from Midtown.

60
00:02:49,372 --> 00:02:50,230
Speaker 1: So, you mean Rockaway?

61
00:02:50,911 --> 00:02:57,150
Speaker 0: Rockaway is far more than 20 minutes away from Midtown, and not 100 times better than Wildwood's beach.

62
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,650
Speaker 1: Not 100 times better than Wildwood, but you can get there really quickly.

63
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,590
Speaker 0: Have you ever taken the subway there?

64
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,370
Speaker 1: No, I just biked there.

65
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,148
Speaker 0: It takes an hour.

66
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,329
Speaker 1: From Midtown?

67
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:05,676
Speaker 1: Yeah.

68
00:03:06,371 --> 00:03:08,290
Speaker 0: In fact, it takes more than an hour from Midtown.

69
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:09,748
Speaker 1: That makes no sense.

70
00:03:10,553 --> 00:03:11,463
Speaker 0: Look at that train.

71
00:03:11,745 --> 00:03:12,170
Speaker 0: Look at it.

72
00:03:13,171 --> 00:03:15,190
Speaker 0: So, there's a ferry that just stops.

73
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,368
Speaker 1: Biking is faster than that.

74
00:03:16,851 --> 00:03:17,249
Speaker 0: Exactly.

75
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,058
Speaker 0: So, yeah, there's a ferry.

76
00:03:19,078 --> 00:03:20,550
Speaker 0: There are people who live.

77
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:28,010
Speaker 1: I thought you were going to say, imagine if right where the Intrepid is is the amazing beach, and you just walk there from Midtown.

78
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:32,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you get on a ferry, and the beach is literally 20 minutes away.

79
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,500
Speaker 0: It's still a little far.

80
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,470
Speaker 1: It's not walk there.

81
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,330
Speaker 0: No, you get on a ferry that costs seven bucks.

82
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:37,828
Speaker 0: That's fine.

83
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:38,657
Speaker 0: Round trip.

84
00:03:38,778 --> 00:03:39,263
Speaker 0: It was awesome.

85
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:49,910
Speaker 0: Two, you know in Wildwood, when we go swimming, when we go to the ocean, even in Florida or whatever, you can dive under the wave, you can ride the wave, jump over the wave, jump into the wave.

86
00:03:50,491 --> 00:03:57,329
Speaker 0: Depending on the wave, you got to do a different thing, but it doesn't really matter, because if you miss, it's just like a wave in the balls or a wave in the face.

87
00:03:59,251 --> 00:04:03,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the waves, just the default waves at Manly Beach, were like eight feet.

88
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,050
Speaker 1: They're real surfing waves like in the movies.

89
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I'm swimming out there.

90
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,910
Speaker 0: Lifeguards, they'll try to save you, I guess, but they give zero fucks how far out you swim.

91
00:04:14,473 --> 00:04:15,170
Speaker 1: No, it's Australia.

92
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,149
Speaker 0: So, I swam way out there.

93
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,810
Speaker 0: Basically, there was a row of people who weren't on surfboards that were the furthest down.

94
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:25,050
Speaker 0: I was one group back from them, because I'm not a pro swimmer.

95
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,009
Speaker 1: That's a good idea.

96
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,110
Speaker 1: That's like how I'm going to be second in line to get cyborg implants.

97
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:34,710
Speaker 0: So, the waves are coming, and it's like eight foot wave, which is already like five feet higher than like the peak we get in Wildwood.

98
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:42,270
Speaker 0: So, I missed reading one once, and it threw me head over heels like 20 or 30 yards back up the beach.

99
00:04:42,913 --> 00:04:44,630
Speaker 0: Like, it was amazing swimming.

100
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,325
Speaker 0: And then a 12-footer came.

101
00:04:46,711 --> 00:04:47,301
Speaker 1: I got my ass kicked.

102
00:04:47,342 --> 00:04:47,668
Speaker 0: It was awesome.

103
00:04:48,472 --> 00:04:51,270
Speaker 0: So, then a 12-footer came, and yeah, that was an awesome beach.

104
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,790
Speaker 1: I remember I was out there with a ruler.

105
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,750
Speaker 1: That's why I got picked up and thrown, because I was measuring each wave.

106
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,090
Speaker 0: So, in Wildwood, like a lot of people just kind of stand there.

107
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,690
Speaker 1: It's also why lifeguards didn't save him.

108
00:04:59,871 --> 00:05:00,527
Speaker 0: And the waves hit him.

109
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:06,470
Speaker 0: So, there, like you see everyone in a row does the exact same thing at the exact same time.

110
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,770
Speaker 0: Like, suddenly a whole line of people just boop under the water, or boop up into the air.

111
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:10,862
Speaker 0: Like, everyone can read the waves.

112
00:05:10,902 --> 00:05:11,530
Speaker 0: It was super fun.

113
00:05:12,973 --> 00:05:14,289
Speaker 0: It's called Manly Beach.

114
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,529
Speaker 0: Do you know why it's called Manly Beach?

115
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,190
Speaker 1: Because you have to be manly to survive?

116
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,936
Speaker 0: Actually, kinda.

117
00:05:20,197 --> 00:05:22,530
Speaker 0: So, it's not like Batman and Batman Avenue.

118
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,810
Speaker 0: So, I assume Manly Beach was named after, like, Lord Manly or something dumb like that.

119
00:05:28,575 --> 00:05:29,549
Speaker 1: That would be my second guess.

120
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:34,629
Speaker 0: So, the first white dude that landed there, the natives were particularly manly to him.

121
00:05:35,271 --> 00:05:39,350
Speaker 0: So, he called it Manly in honor of those manly natives.

122
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,289
Speaker 0: And I was climbing.

123
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,430
Speaker 1: And that gay, gay, gay explorer.

124
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,530
Speaker 0: And I was climbing.

125
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,470
Speaker 1: The awesomest explorer of all time.

126
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:47,729
Speaker 0: I think they, like, stabbed him with a spear.

127
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,140
Speaker 0: And he was like, "It's okay.

128
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:49,604
Speaker 0: You guys are

129
00:05:49,705 --> 00:05:49,988
Speaker 0: awesome.".

130
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:50,693
Speaker 1: "This guy's okay.

131
00:05:50,774 --> 00:05:52,967
Speaker 1: This guy's the most amazing explorer I've ever heard of.

132
00:05:53,028 --> 00:05:53,309
Speaker 1: He's my

133
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:53,410
Speaker 1: hero.".

134
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:58,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, Australia's fucking... So, this is the most Australian... Knifey spoonie expert.

135
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,410
Speaker 0: Beyond even Manly Beach is two monuments at Manly Beach.

136
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:07,770
Speaker 0: The first monument is a plaque that commemorates the first time white people stood there.

137
00:06:07,894 --> 00:06:08,149
Speaker 1: Great.

138
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:14,710
Speaker 0: And the second one, I was climbing on these cliffs around, like, the tidal basin, like the tidal pools.

139
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,089
Speaker 0: I was, like, both climbing on these cliffs.

140
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,165
Speaker 0: And the tide was, like, out, so it was pretty safe.

141
00:06:19,507 --> 00:06:20,050
Speaker 0: I figured it was fine.

142
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,488
Speaker 1: Wouldn't it be more safe if the tide was in?

143
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:25,049
Speaker 1: Because then you'd land in water if you fell, as opposed to jagged rocks?

144
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:30,330
Speaker 0: No, if you land in that water, the water is only, like, a foot deep over the rocks.

145
00:06:30,714 --> 00:06:31,950
Speaker 0: And it's super roiling.

146
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,650
Speaker 0: Roiling is the word I would use.

147
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,110
Speaker 0: Meaning, you know the phrase...

148
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,810
Speaker 1: It's not really going to help you either way if you fall.

149
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,829
Speaker 0: You know the phrase "dash upon the rocks to death"?

150
00:06:40,732 --> 00:06:42,970
Speaker 0: That is what would happen if you were in that water when the tide was up.

151
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,404
Speaker 1: No, because I'd just climb down.

152
00:06:46,444 --> 00:06:47,190
Speaker 0: I wasn't going to fall.

153
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,710
Speaker 0: So I'm climbing around, and I see this big boulder.

154
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:50,051
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.

155
00:06:50,132 --> 00:06:50,635
Speaker 1: I saw you.

156
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:52,990
Speaker 1: You were thinking about the situation where you climbed down and not the situation where you...

157
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:54,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, if I have trouble, I was just going to climb down.

158
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,307
Speaker 0: If you fall to your death.

159
00:06:55,811 --> 00:06:57,069
Speaker 0: And if I fell, like, fuck it.

160
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:02,970
Speaker 0: But what I didn't want to be in the situation of is I'm climbing, I get into trouble, and now the tide's in, and I can't climb down.

161
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:09,110
Speaker 0: So I'm out there, and I see a rock, like, a big rock just kind of hanging out, like, kind of on the beach and the other rocks.

162
00:07:09,632 --> 00:07:10,847
Speaker 0: And there's a plaque on it.

163
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:16,890
Speaker 0: So I kind of, like, carefully make my way over there with a little bit of swimming and get to this rock.

164
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,269
Speaker 0: You know what the plaque basically says?

165
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:23,166
Speaker 0: "In 1912, this giant-ass rock washed up on the beach after a crazy

166
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:23,507
Speaker 0: storm.".

167
00:07:24,552 --> 00:07:26,430
Speaker 0: And to commemorate this, plaque.

168
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:34,770
Speaker 0: So they have a plaque commemorating the day in 1912 that a particularly big rock washed up on the beach.

169
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,590
Speaker 1: In 1912, how exciting do you think things were in Sydney?

170
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:39,892
Speaker 1: Really?

171
00:07:39,912 --> 00:07:46,750
Speaker 1: I mean, that big rock just showing up out of nowhere was probably, like, the biggest news they had in two months.

172
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:51,682
Speaker 1: It was probably, like, everyone was probably stopping to check, like, "Hey, did you see that rock that showed up?

173
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:53,406
Speaker 1: Holy shit.

174
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:54,469
Speaker 1: That motherfucker is

175
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:54,670
Speaker 1: big.".

176
00:07:55,372 --> 00:07:57,990
Speaker 0: So the other thing, I was hanging around, you know, doing my thing, and I went biking.

177
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:03,910
Speaker 0: I rented some shito semi-mountain bike, and I biked, like, all around the Yarra River in Melbourne and a lot of Australia stuff.

178
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,670
Speaker 0: I passed by an apartment rental place, and I was checking out, like, apartments for rent.

179
00:08:08,317 --> 00:08:09,430
Speaker 0: The rents were pretty reasonable.

180
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:16,630
Speaker 0: Then I remembered from last year that rents in Australia are written down per week.

181
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,669
Speaker 1: Can you actually rent it for one week?

182
00:08:19,451 --> 00:08:19,793
Speaker 0: No.

183
00:08:19,813 --> 00:08:21,604
Speaker 0: It's just that's how they denote rent.

184
00:08:21,664 --> 00:08:22,690
Speaker 0: It's per week, not per month.

185
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:23,829
Speaker 1: Do you have to pay it every week?

186
00:08:24,235 --> 00:08:24,769
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

187
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:25,282
Speaker 0: Okay.

188
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:31,110
Speaker 0: And all that meant was that the rents were New York rents as opposed to pretty reasonable rents.

189
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,239
Speaker 1: It's a major city.

190
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,109
Speaker 1: It has New York rents.

191
00:08:34,231 --> 00:08:42,030
Speaker 1: However, if it was actually 25% of the New York rent price, it would be a very crowded city with people trying to live there.

192
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,498
Speaker 0: So Australia might be my backup plan.

193
00:08:44,518 --> 00:08:48,117
Speaker 0: if I ever have to leave the country, simply for the fact that I could- They're not going to let you in.

194
00:08:48,158 --> 00:08:49,709
Speaker 1: It's very hard to get a visa or whatnot.

195
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:56,690
Speaker 0: I am confident I could get myself Australian citizenship or naturalization or a green card or a visa or whatever.

196
00:08:57,232 --> 00:08:59,489
Speaker 0: I am super confident I can make that happen.

197
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:01,138
Speaker 1: Sure.

198
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:01,469
Speaker 1: Good luck.

199
00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:06,790
Speaker 0: The industry I work in by day is that kind of industry.

200
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:12,450
Speaker 0: I mean, a lot of people I know live there or live in Singapore.

201
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:18,069
Speaker 0: And basically, because they work in that industry, they can just live there forever and work there and the government's totally okay with it.

202
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,299
Speaker 0: So yeah, Australia was super awesome.

203
00:09:22,741 --> 00:09:25,369
Speaker 0: The sun doesn't fucking fuck around down there.

204
00:09:25,953 --> 00:09:27,690
Speaker 1: You're pretty close to that whole no zone layer.

205
00:09:27,831 --> 00:09:31,710
Speaker 0: And their sunscreen is way better than our sunscreen.

206
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,466
Speaker 1: I'm sure it is.

207
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,170
Speaker 0: Apparently, it's much more tightly regulated and they use that one chemical that we're not allowed to use.

208
00:09:38,053 --> 00:09:39,570
Speaker 0: I brought back a shit ton of that sunscreen.

209
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:40,206
Speaker 1: Oh, they let you?

210
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,610
Speaker 0: Well, no one asked.

211
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,668
Speaker 1: Customs didn't find it?

212
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,649
Speaker 0: Customs didn't even look at me.

213
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:46,548
Speaker 1: There you go.

214
00:09:46,834 --> 00:09:46,921
Speaker 0: Yeah.

215
00:09:47,951 --> 00:09:48,430
Speaker 1: White privilege.

216
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:50,508
Speaker 1: Smuggling.

217
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,490
Speaker 1: A little Han Solo over here.

218
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:56,330
Speaker 0: Well, I declared $40 of stuff that I brought back over here.

219
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,890
Speaker 0: Remember, Australia doesn't care what you bring out of the country.

220
00:09:59,751 --> 00:10:00,928
Speaker 0: The US just cares what you bring in.

221
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,077
Speaker 1: Because it's an island.

222
00:10:02,098 --> 00:10:03,070
Speaker 1: They don't want you bringing in shit.

223
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:08,270
Speaker 0: Though, Australia does have exit immigration, which the US does not have.

224
00:10:08,711 --> 00:10:11,570
Speaker 0: So to leave Australia, you've got to go through immigration.

225
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:16,470
Speaker 0: And that line was longer than any line I've ever stood in to get into any country.

226
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,103
Speaker 1: We didn't have to go through a crazy line.

227
00:10:18,123 --> 00:10:18,850
Speaker 1: we left last time.

228
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:19,768
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know why?

229
00:10:20,051 --> 00:10:23,810
Speaker 0: Because some Australian little fucking teenager went and joined ISIS.

230
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,207
Speaker 0: And Australia's panicking about it.

231
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:34,519
Speaker 0: So they're super scrutinizing anyone who's leaving the country to make sure they're not intending to go to Turkey, which is apparently the way you go.

232
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:36,310
Speaker 0: if you want to then go fight for ISIS.

233
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:39,129
Speaker 1: So shouldn't they just check the people with plane tickets to Turkey?

234
00:10:40,053 --> 00:10:41,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that holds up the line, I guess.

235
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,769
Speaker 1: How is your passport with your turkey stamps?

236
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:43,770
Speaker 1: Does that help you out?

237
00:10:44,612 --> 00:10:48,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, so people there... We were talking about passports.

238
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,710
Speaker 0: Because I ran into Brian Hicks and all these little people I haven't seen in forever.

239
00:10:51,732 --> 00:10:52,370
Speaker 0: Since September.

240
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,103
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's like, "What the fuck are you going to Turkey all the time

241
00:10:55,183 --> 00:10:55,324
Speaker 0: for?".

242
00:10:56,594 --> 00:10:57,348
Speaker 1: Gobble, gobble, gobble.

243
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,648
Speaker 0: Yeah, super fun time.

244
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,189
Speaker 1: It's gobble season pretty soon over here.

245
00:11:01,431 --> 00:11:02,066
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is.

246
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,370
Speaker 1: I'm getting all up in that.

247
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:04,539
Speaker 0: I'm excited about this.

248
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:05,650
Speaker 0: I'm feeling some turkey.

249
00:11:06,071 --> 00:11:07,430
Speaker 0: I want to make some fucking stuffing.

250
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:08,890
Speaker 0: Oh my gosh.

251
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:09,344
Speaker 0: Soap top.

252
00:11:09,993 --> 00:11:10,548
Speaker 0: Yeah, no.

253
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:13,889
Speaker 1: You said yeah.

254
00:11:15,752 --> 00:11:17,567
Speaker 1: I could just buy some and make it right at home.

255
00:11:18,051 --> 00:11:19,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, the reptile brain.

256
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:23,208
Speaker 0: The same part of your brain that when you're hungry smells McDonald's and says, "Eat some of that

257
00:11:23,228 --> 00:11:23,429
Speaker 0: shit.".

258
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:23,932
Speaker 1: You know what?

259
00:11:23,993 --> 00:11:26,309
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll just buy some stove top on the way home and then cook it.

260
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:27,473
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

261
00:11:27,815 --> 00:11:30,270
Speaker 0: Part of your brain is going to really, really enjoy that.

262
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,630
Speaker 0: And meanwhile, the rest of your brain is going to be getting ready to eject.

263
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,670
Speaker 1: We used to eat that shit so much.

264
00:11:33,732 --> 00:11:34,308
Speaker 0: I know we did.

265
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,169
Speaker 0: And we even made it with margarine and butter.

266
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:36,932
Speaker 1: You know what?

267
00:11:36,972 --> 00:11:39,987
Speaker 1: Tonight, I'll just go and get that and a tub of frosting.

268
00:11:40,027 --> 00:11:40,510
Speaker 1: That'll be dinner.

269
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:41,530
Speaker 0: Tub of frosting.

270
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:45,890
Speaker 0: If you want to go full on, the entree has to be a Red Baron Four Cheese pizza.

271
00:11:46,374 --> 00:11:48,127
Speaker 1: I don't know if I can find one of those.

272
00:11:50,035 --> 00:11:51,445
Speaker 0: Also known as we brought...

273
00:11:52,453 --> 00:11:53,710
Speaker 1: I could do macaroni and ketchup.

274
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:58,787
Speaker 0: I think Scott and I both burned our mouths severely ten times.

275
00:12:00,215 --> 00:12:00,549
Speaker 0: A lot of times.

276
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,270
Speaker 0: And also being the number of times we ate the Red Baron Four Cheese pizza.

277
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:04,765
Speaker 1: Yes.

278
00:12:05,811 --> 00:12:06,675
Speaker 0: Those were good times.

279
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:08,122
Speaker 0: That really hurt.

280
00:12:08,182 --> 00:12:09,910
Speaker 0: I remember not being able to taste things.

281
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,150
Speaker 1: It was mostly that microwave's fault.

282
00:12:12,271 --> 00:12:13,703
Speaker 1: It wasn't the Red Baron's fault.

283
00:12:13,965 --> 00:12:14,470
Speaker 1: He's a good guy.

284
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,576
Speaker 0: I think the Red Baron.

285
00:12:15,938 --> 00:12:16,502
Speaker 0: That pizza.

286
00:12:17,025 --> 00:12:17,930
Speaker 0: It depends on what side you're on.

287
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:24,250
Speaker 0: Remember, when I was in Turkey last, I saw World War I and all this stuff from the opposite perspective.

288
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:26,821
Speaker 0: Where the good guys and the bad guys were reversed.

289
00:12:26,862 --> 00:12:28,530
Speaker 0: from the usual perspective you get in the West.

290
00:12:29,653 --> 00:12:31,229
Speaker 0: So, Red Baron was a good guy to some people.

291
00:12:34,118 --> 00:12:34,330
Speaker 1: Anyway.

292
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,330
Speaker 0: So you got anything to talk about in the front bit?

293
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:36,912
Speaker 1: I do.

294
00:12:36,973 --> 00:12:39,390
Speaker 1: So, I'm going to talk about some netrunning.

295
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:40,648
Speaker 1: Because you know whatevs.

296
00:12:41,492 --> 00:12:43,830
Speaker 1: So, the company that makes Netrunner is Fantasy Flight Games.

297
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:44,916
Speaker 1: They make a lot of games.

298
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:46,889
Speaker 1: Games you might, you know, just normal board games too.

299
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,922
Speaker 1: Like, um, Citadel's.

300
00:12:49,285 --> 00:12:49,910
Speaker 1: They published that.

301
00:12:50,112 --> 00:12:50,362
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

302
00:12:51,151 --> 00:12:54,530
Speaker 1: And, uh, you know, they're a huge US game company publisher.

303
00:12:55,351 --> 00:12:57,989
Speaker 1: So, their world championships are right now.

304
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,770
Speaker 1: But I'm not fucking going to Minnesota to play fucking Netrunner.

305
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:01,809
Speaker 1: That's insane.

306
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:02,609
Speaker 0: What if you could have won?

307
00:13:03,211 --> 00:13:04,930
Speaker 1: I couldn't even win in Boston or Philadelphia.

308
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,550
Speaker 1: So what makes you think I'm going to win in Minnesota?

309
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:07,829
Speaker 0: How many New Yorkers went there?

310
00:13:08,717 --> 00:13:10,250
Speaker 1: I know two New Yorkers who went there.

311
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,670
Speaker 1: But one of them won the Canadian National Championship.

312
00:13:12,972 --> 00:13:15,109
Speaker 1: And the other one won the Boston Regionals.

313
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,107
Speaker 1: Well, Cambridge Massachusetts Regionals.

314
00:13:17,651 --> 00:13:19,429
Speaker 1: So, let's hope they win.

315
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,009
Speaker 1: And they're going to, they're planning to win.

316
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:22,485
Speaker 1: I'll root.

317
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,468
Speaker 1: And they're better than me.

318
00:13:23,972 --> 00:13:24,750
Speaker 1: So, anyway.

319
00:13:25,633 --> 00:13:27,310
Speaker 1: So, they're live streaming that shit.

320
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,470
Speaker 1: You know, Fantasy Flight Games screws a lot of things up.

321
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:36,490
Speaker 1: But one thing they don't screw up is at least, you know, live streaming for the world championships.

322
00:13:36,651 --> 00:13:38,101
Speaker 1: So, you can watch it twitch.tv/ffglive.

323
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:43,390
Speaker 1: And also, they realize Netrunner is the real game.

324
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,410
Speaker 1: And all the other games are sort of second fiddle at best.

325
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:50,829
Speaker 1: So, if you want to see all those other games like X-Wing Miniatures, Game of Thrones card game, etc.

326
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,929
Speaker 1: You got to watch like Today, Tomorrow, Friday, you know.

327
00:13:54,571 --> 00:13:56,070
Speaker 1: Saturday there's going to be some Netrunner.

328
00:13:56,511 --> 00:13:58,350
Speaker 1: Sunday is nothing but Netrunner.

329
00:13:58,735 --> 00:13:59,290
Speaker 1: All day.

330
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:02,130
Speaker 1: No other game has a day dedicated to just itself.

331
00:14:02,411 --> 00:14:05,550
Speaker 0: I think Netrunner is becoming the football of tabletop.

332
00:14:05,915 --> 00:14:06,909
Speaker 1: It pretty much sort of is.

333
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,150
Speaker 1: It's becoming a big deal.

334
00:14:09,551 --> 00:14:13,545
Speaker 1: So, you want to watch Netrunner World Championships this Sunday, twitch.tv/ffglive.

335
00:14:15,613 --> 00:14:15,658
Speaker 0: Oh.

336
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:19,310
Speaker 0: So, not talking about PAX, but speaking of that and like sport.

337
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,350
Speaker 0: Because they're streaming a tabletop game.

338
00:14:22,472 --> 00:14:25,590
Speaker 0: People keep saying esports, but I feel like it's just like G-sports, game sports.

339
00:14:26,915 --> 00:14:28,930
Speaker 1: No, it's sports and games.

340
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:33,430
Speaker 1: Esports are just sports because they involve physical athletic ability.

341
00:14:33,531 --> 00:14:36,630
Speaker 1: Even though it's only the athletic ability of your hands, it's still athletic ability.

342
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,810
Speaker 1: Something like chess is not a sport.

343
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:44,630
Speaker 1: It's just a game because there is no athletic ability required or tested by the game itself.

344
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:50,070
Speaker 0: So, poker is on ESPN 2 or 3 or whatever, but that's a game, not a sport.

345
00:14:50,212 --> 00:14:50,649
Speaker 1: Exactly.

346
00:14:50,972 --> 00:14:52,169
Speaker 0: Unless you had jungle poker.

347
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:53,509
Speaker 0: Jungle poker.

348
00:14:54,574 --> 00:14:55,169
Speaker 0: Poker boxing.

349
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:59,010
Speaker 0: So, you flip over a card and whoever grabs the totem first gets that card.

350
00:14:59,430 --> 00:14:59,810
Speaker 1: Poker boxing.

351
00:15:00,935 --> 00:15:01,421
Speaker 0: I would poker box.

352
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:02,501
Speaker 1: Yeah.

353
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:09,568
Speaker 1: No, you wouldn't because probably the best people at poker boxing would probably be boxers and not poker players.

354
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,910
Speaker 1: So, you would just get the KO.

355
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,150
Speaker 0: No, you just got to get someone who's immune.

356
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:17,290
Speaker 1: Someone like you stand up and then a professional boxer stands up.

357
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:17,848
Speaker 1: It's like I fold.

358
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,630
Speaker 0: You got to get the kind of person.

359
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:19,950
Speaker 0: I fold.

360
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,490
Speaker 1: It's all you.

361
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:20,887
Speaker 1: I'm all in.

362
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,242
Speaker 1: I fold.

363
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:24,130
Speaker 0: Who could hold out against Mike Tyson until his arms got tired.

364
00:15:24,534 --> 00:15:24,749
Speaker 1: Nobody.

365
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:26,269
Speaker 0: A couple people were able to.

366
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:26,748
Speaker 0: Zero people.

367
00:15:27,395 --> 00:15:28,290
Speaker 0: One or two people.

368
00:15:28,471 --> 00:15:29,308
Speaker 1: No one on earth.

369
00:15:30,031 --> 00:15:32,070
Speaker 0: I think Mike Tyson's got a TV show now, that cartoon.

370
00:15:32,256 --> 00:15:32,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, he does.

371
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:36,810
Speaker 1: It's basically Scooby Doo plus Mike Tyson plus Adult Swim.

372
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:37,306
Speaker 1: Yeah.

373
00:15:38,592 --> 00:15:39,449
Speaker 0: That's a thing.

374
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:40,669
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not watching that.

375
00:15:41,134 --> 00:15:41,286
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

376
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:51,229
Speaker 0: So, with all that, I was doing one of the panels at PAX and I talked about bad feedback and bad heuristics in games and I used Dodas and League of Legends, all those MOBAs as an example.

377
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:51,540
Speaker 0: Yeah.

378
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:55,710
Speaker 0: In the US, when we shit all over MOBAs, people get really mad.

379
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:56,850
Speaker 1: I know they don't get really mad.

380
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,964
Speaker 0: But there's a little bit of like, "Oh,

381
00:15:59,044 --> 00:15:59,145
Speaker 0: boo.".

382
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:06,129
Speaker 1: People love those games and if they're one of the people who plays those games, they defend them to some extent.

383
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:16,630
Speaker 0: In Australia, the people who came up to me after the panel play a lot of MOBAs and were like, "Wow, that explains why I am not the world champion at MOBAs.

384
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,590
Speaker 0: Playing MOBAs doesn't teach you MOBAs.

385
00:16:18,851 --> 00:16:19,601
Speaker 0: How should I learn

386
00:16:19,621 --> 00:16:20,026
Speaker 0: MOBAs?".

387
00:16:20,552 --> 00:16:22,707
Speaker 0: And I was like, "Just find someone who's good and get them to teach

388
00:16:22,727 --> 00:16:22,827
Speaker 0: you.".

389
00:16:23,722 --> 00:16:24,370
Speaker 0: Is there any other way?

390
00:16:24,675 --> 00:16:24,785
Speaker 0: No.

391
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:28,610
Speaker 1: Read all the wikis and facts and practice like crazy.

392
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,929
Speaker 0: Or write a wiki by reverse engineering the whole game.

393
00:16:32,831 --> 00:16:36,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, decompile the source code and figure out frame timings and whatnot.

394
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:36,400
Speaker 0: Yep.

395
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,468
Speaker 1: It's just like a fighting game.

396
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,100
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

397
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:53,000
Speaker 0: So when I was in Paxos, another thing is I brought up Five Nights at Freddy's, so I was talking about horror games.

398
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:56,140
Speaker 1: My sister actually made a Let's Play of that for her work.

399
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,913
Speaker 0: I started recording myself playing it, live streaming it.

400
00:16:59,933 --> 00:17:03,860
Speaker 0: I'm not interested in, but no one's really done a teardown of the mechanics.

401
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:08,318
Speaker 0: And I'm doing one of those kinds of videos like, "This game's jump

402
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:08,640
Speaker 0: scares.".

403
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,760
Speaker 1: Welcome, you're not playing TIE Fighter.

404
00:17:10,582 --> 00:17:11,700
Speaker 0: 'Cause I just got back.

405
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:13,117
Speaker 1: No, I played TIE Fighter when you were away.

406
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,660
Speaker 0: And I don't have a joystick yet.

407
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,060
Speaker 1: If you play the 1994 version, you can use mouse and keyboard.

408
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,920
Speaker 0: Why the fuck would you even?

409
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,980
Speaker 1: It actually worked pretty well.

410
00:17:23,141 --> 00:17:24,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's not TIE Fighter.

411
00:17:24,941 --> 00:17:25,720
Speaker 0: That's like... It worked.

412
00:17:26,928 --> 00:17:27,659
Speaker 1: Would you rather do that?

413
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,780
Speaker 1: There were no TIE Fighter at all.

414
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:29,580
Speaker 0: No TIE Fighter.

415
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,275
Speaker 0: No, I'll play it.

416
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's good.

417
00:17:31,841 --> 00:17:32,193
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

418
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,860
Speaker 1: The emperor is pleased with my performance.

419
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,198
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you're playing... What about the shadow guy?

420
00:17:36,561 --> 00:17:37,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got a promotion from him.

421
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,418
Speaker 0: Do you have a tattoo?

422
00:17:39,081 --> 00:17:39,417
Speaker 1: Not yet.

423
00:17:40,723 --> 00:17:41,438
Speaker 1: I'm working on it.

424
00:17:42,421 --> 00:17:45,140
Speaker 0: I'm gonna live stream the shit out of some TIE Fighter, I have to get a joystick.

425
00:17:45,922 --> 00:17:46,899
Speaker 1: I thought you had one around here.

426
00:17:47,722 --> 00:17:49,018
Speaker 0: No, I did.

427
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:49,856
Speaker 0: So I did.

428
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,899
Speaker 0: But that joystick, I'm pretty sure doesn't actually work.

429
00:17:54,422 --> 00:17:55,955
Speaker 0: And I haven't used it in a decade, so.

430
00:17:56,985 --> 00:17:57,457
Speaker 1: I'll take it.

431
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,839
Speaker 0: I don't even know where it is.

432
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,640
Speaker 0: I might have thrown it away.

433
00:17:59,742 --> 00:18:00,760
Speaker 0: Maybe in that blue suitcase.

434
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,620
Speaker 1: In one of these boxes.

435
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,019
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm looking at a line.

436
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,460
Speaker 0: Actually, there were a bunch of joysticks for sale at PAXOS.

437
00:18:07,484 --> 00:18:08,858
Speaker 0: And they looked real nice.

438
00:18:10,183 --> 00:18:12,300
Speaker 0: But things are expensive in Australia.

439
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,919
Speaker 0: Except Uniqlo stuff was cheap.

440
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,680
Speaker 0: So anyway, Five Nights at Freddy's, regardless of... I really like that game.

441
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,920
Speaker 0: It doesn't have a lot of replay value, but I think no one's done a game like that before.

442
00:18:24,461 --> 00:18:24,996
Speaker 1: It's no FTL.

443
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,079
Speaker 0: No, totally different kinds of games.

444
00:18:28,643 --> 00:18:30,500
Speaker 0: There's also that duck song on YouTube.

445
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,179
Speaker 0: That video.

446
00:18:32,561 --> 00:18:33,300
Speaker 1: The stupid duck song.

447
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,260
Speaker 0: Everyone bumps into it occasionally as a recommended video.

448
00:18:36,922 --> 00:18:39,340
Speaker 0: It's one of the most watched videos ever on YouTube.

449
00:18:40,182 --> 00:18:42,618
Speaker 0: That stupid song gets stuck in your head, waddle, waddle.

450
00:18:44,782 --> 00:18:48,580
Speaker 0: And someone mashed that up with Five Nights at Freddy's, and it is apt.

451
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:56,299
Speaker 0: The only thing more apt than that is an image that I just found that mashed up something old and amazing.

452
00:18:57,024 --> 00:18:57,557
Speaker 0: I found this.

453
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,379
Speaker 1: Where did you find that?

454
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,519
Speaker 1: Did you search for that on purpose?

455
00:18:59,841 --> 00:19:01,200
Speaker 0: I was looking for a picture.

456
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:05,120
Speaker 1: How could anyone have combined those two so remote things?

457
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:10,893
Speaker 0: I was looking for pictures from Five Nights at Freddy's to make my panel, and I found this.

458
00:19:11,343 --> 00:19:11,859
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

459
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,140
Speaker 0: So this is my alternate thing of the day.

460
00:19:14,565 --> 00:19:15,060
Speaker 1: It's incorrect.

461
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,855
Speaker 1: You should say, "It's Freddy time," instead of, "It's

462
00:19:18,016 --> 00:19:18,157
Speaker 1: me.".

463
00:19:19,802 --> 00:19:22,939
Speaker 0: Well, so "It's me" is an inside joke for Five Nights at Freddy's.

464
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:23,949
Speaker 0: It's me.

465
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:32,112
Speaker 0: Basically, one of the things that the game does to kind of explain how the game is horror, there's text.

466
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:41,760
Speaker 0: There's a sign that says, "Out of order," and whenever anything weird happens, that's like the unexplained and creepy catchphrase.

467
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:46,799
Speaker 0: So if you look at that room when the game's fucked up, the sign says, "It's me," instead.

468
00:19:47,861 --> 00:19:49,620
Speaker 0: That doesn't make any sense, and it's kind of unnerving.

469
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:53,416
Speaker 0: And then you hear a voice at one point that just whispers to you like, "It's

470
00:19:53,477 --> 00:19:53,637
Speaker 0: me."

471
00:19:54,301 --> 00:19:57,280
Speaker 0: And once or twice, "It's me," just flashes on the screen for no reason.

472
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,109
Speaker 1: Okay.

473
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:11,577
Speaker 0: So it's one of those like, there's a consistent, unnerving, and not really contextually explainable thing that happens, which is the kind of thing in proper horror that puts someone's brain ill at ease.

474
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:24,466
Speaker 0: Like when you see something that your brain can't parse, like when you're laying in the room late at night, and you wake up, and a shadow's a certain way, and you see something that your brain cannot parse, and your brain gets into this mode of, "What is that, and what does it

475
00:20:24,507 --> 00:20:24,731
Speaker 0: mean?".

476
00:20:25,421 --> 00:20:28,986
Speaker 0: Before your smart brain wakes up a little bit and says, "The curtain moved, go back to

477
00:20:29,007 --> 00:20:29,197
Speaker 0: bed.".

478
00:20:29,402 --> 00:20:30,459
Speaker 1: It's a shirt on a chair.

479
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:30,808
Speaker 0: Yup.

480
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:38,320
Speaker 0: But before the shirt on the chair part of the brain steps in, there's a tiny part of the brain, some old ancient part that says, "Whatever that is, I gotta figure out if it's

481
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:39,791
Speaker 0: dangerous.".

482
00:20:40,107 --> 00:20:40,339
Speaker 0: So yeah.

483
00:20:40,882 --> 00:20:41,779
Speaker 0: So that's my thing of the day.

484
00:20:42,002 --> 00:20:42,258
Speaker 1: All right.

485
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:42,919
Speaker 0: Don't wear it out.

486
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,500
Speaker 1: My thing of the day, there are pygmy seahorses.

487
00:20:46,101 --> 00:20:46,800
Speaker 1: I like sea creatures.

488
00:20:47,442 --> 00:20:48,380
Speaker 1: I like sea creatures.

489
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,819
Speaker 0: I'm typing this into Google right now.

490
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,300
Speaker 1: A pygmy seahorse is an excellent sea creature.

491
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,959
Speaker 1: It's a really tiny seahorse.

492
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:00,800
Speaker 1: Now, pygmy seahorses, I learned a lot about them from this video, and you're gonna learn everything that I know about them from this video.

493
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:07,680
Speaker 1: They're really tiny, and the pygmy seahorse comes in two varieties, orange and purple.

494
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:14,760
Speaker 1: The orange ones, they basically, no matter which color they are, they basically live in some sort of sea plant for their whole lives.

495
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,860
Speaker 1: They just sort of, you know, hang out on the plant, and they look just like the plant.

496
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,219
Speaker 1: They have little nurples on them, just like the plant.

497
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,119
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, look at those nurples.

498
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:20,900
Speaker 1: All right.

499
00:21:21,621 --> 00:21:24,700
Speaker 1: So the orange one lives in the orange plants, and the purple one lives in the purple plant.

500
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:30,820
Speaker 1: And they live their seahorse lives hanging out in that plant, and then they die their seahorse death living in that plant.

501
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:36,551
Speaker 1: So scientists were like, "Hey, how come you never see a purple one in an orange plant or an orange one in a purple

502
00:21:36,571 --> 00:21:36,814
Speaker 1: plant?".

503
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:49,140
Speaker 1: It's like, do they just, you know, and it's perfectly, you know, maybe there's just two different genetic variations, and the orange ones are born in an orange plant, and so they live in it, and then the purple ones are born in a purple plant, so they live in that.

504
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,660
Speaker 0: Or maybe like they get a pigment from like their diet, like there's a lot of possible explanations.

505
00:21:53,440 --> 00:22:02,720
Speaker 1: So it was very difficult, but eventually they managed to snatch two orange ones and bring them back to like an aquarium lab place without them dying.

506
00:22:03,108 --> 00:22:03,498
Speaker 1: So they did.

507
00:22:04,341 --> 00:22:08,936
Speaker 1: And then of course, you know how seahorses do, where the dude carries the babies and squirts them out, right?

508
00:22:10,501 --> 00:22:19,958
Speaker 1: So they had it, they got the two orange ones make babies, and they put some of the babies with the orange plant and some with the purple plant to see if they would all be orange or some of them would be purple.

509
00:22:20,263 --> 00:22:20,800
Speaker 0: And what happened?

510
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,660
Speaker 0: I'm skimming Wikipedia.

511
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,460
Speaker 0: I don't know the answer.

512
00:22:23,701 --> 00:22:24,074
Speaker 1: Damn it.

513
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,099
Speaker 0: So those are pretty awesome animals.

514
00:22:30,421 --> 00:22:32,639
Speaker 0: Should we do a Thursday show on sea animals?

515
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,919
Speaker 1: Rays are the best, the end.

516
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,600
Speaker 0: I'm pretty, I'm a fan of dolphins, different kinds of dolphins.

517
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:38,697
Speaker 1: They're okay.

518
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,320
Speaker 1: Dolphins are all smart, but not that cool.

519
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,056
Speaker 0: Whales are good too.

520
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:41,851
Speaker 1: Whoo.

521
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:46,540
Speaker 1: Whales are sort of big and mystical, but it's no octopus.

522
00:22:47,621 --> 00:22:49,039
Speaker 0: Well, octopus versus giant squid.

523
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,780
Speaker 1: Giant squid is the king of the sea.

524
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,880
Speaker 0: Octopus is more mischievous, in my opinion.

525
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:58,018
Speaker 0: Giant squid's a little more frightening and bitey bitey, but I don't really know a lot about either of them.

526
00:22:58,018 --> 00:22:58,946
Speaker 1: 20,000 leagues, kind of.

527
00:23:00,362 --> 00:23:03,160
Speaker 1: Squid is the best little cracking action.

528
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:09,239
Speaker 0: In the meta moment, we are back and on our regular schedule, I've got a bit of a post about Pax Pox, I think.

529
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,240
Speaker 0: It started coming on today, but hopefully I will be good to continue doing shows.

530
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,240
Speaker 0: So on Tuesday, we will talk about Paxos and I don't know, what should we talk about?

531
00:23:18,423 --> 00:23:18,939
Speaker 1: Some kind of game.

532
00:23:19,201 --> 00:23:20,700
Speaker 0: Have we even done a show on Pendante yet?

533
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,920
Speaker 1: Have we done a show on Tie Fighter?

534
00:23:22,741 --> 00:23:24,180
Speaker 0: Tie Fighter, Pendante.

535
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,820
Speaker 1: There's a lot of games to talk about.

536
00:23:26,162 --> 00:23:28,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a lot of gaming news as well.

537
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:29,880
Speaker 0: Lots of game.

538
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,480
Speaker 0: We could just do game shows forever.

539
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,599
Speaker 1: And next Thursday, I don't know what we're going to do, but maybe you should select a book club book.

540
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,459
Speaker 0: So the next book club book.

541
00:23:36,946 --> 00:23:37,359
Speaker 1: Oh, great.

542
00:23:37,962 --> 00:23:42,360
Speaker 0: I have actually selected one and it is Watership Down.

543
00:23:44,725 --> 00:23:46,660
Speaker 0: Why don't you want to read Watership Down?

544
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,940
Speaker 0: What's wrong with Watership Down?

545
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,520
Speaker 0: It's one of the most famous and beloved books in English literature.

546
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,899
Speaker 0: It's one of the more read books ever.

547
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:59,816
Speaker 0: It's extremely popular and there's a pretty interesting story as to how and why the book was written.

548
00:24:01,081 --> 00:24:01,778
Speaker 1: I don't really care.

549
00:24:02,281 --> 00:24:02,760
Speaker 0: You don't care?

550
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:03,440
Speaker 1: Not really.

551
00:24:04,222 --> 00:24:07,220
Speaker 0: What do you think Watership Down by Richard Adams is about?

552
00:24:07,662 --> 00:24:08,117
Speaker 1: Bunny war.

553
00:24:09,544 --> 00:24:10,255
Speaker 0: That's yeah, kind of.

554
00:24:13,324 --> 00:24:16,259
Speaker 0: In my... So I was asking like in Australia, I was like, "Hey, book

555
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:16,420
Speaker 0: club.".

556
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:19,620
Speaker 0: I was asking a lot of people there because a lot of our newer listeners are there.

557
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,060
Speaker 0: People who don't... They haven't listened to old episodes.

558
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,720
Speaker 0: They don't know what our fucking deal is yet.

559
00:24:24,402 --> 00:24:26,879
Speaker 0: They're young and naive and don't realize what assholes we are.

560
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:30,977
Speaker 0: So I was asking them like, "Hey, what book should we do on the

561
00:24:31,037 --> 00:24:31,258
Speaker 0: show?".

562
00:24:31,883 --> 00:24:33,600
Speaker 0: And a lot of people said, "Prince of Nothing.

563
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,740
Speaker 0: You should read that book.

564
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,290
Speaker 0: That book's

565
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:35,576
Speaker 0: good.".

566
00:24:35,862 --> 00:24:36,559
Speaker 1: People said that?

567
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:36,829
Speaker 1: Yeah.

568
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:42,033
Speaker 0: Multiple people recommended it when I was like, "Oh, what's a good fantasy book we could talk about on Geek

569
00:24:42,053 --> 00:24:42,339
Speaker 0: Nights?".

570
00:24:43,001 --> 00:24:45,097
Speaker 0: And they were like, "So have you ever heard of R. Scott

571
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:45,399
Speaker 0: Bakker?".

572
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,057
Speaker 0: I'm like, "Have you heard of R. Scott

573
00:24:47,137 --> 00:24:47,360
Speaker 0: Bakker?".

574
00:24:47,742 --> 00:24:51,479
Speaker 0: And I quote myself, "I'm sorry, but I believe I have come before

575
00:24:51,499 --> 00:24:51,599
Speaker 0: you.".

576
00:24:55,443 --> 00:24:56,640
Speaker 0: So yeah, that is the book club book.

577
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,700
Speaker 0: You can just call me the darkness.

578
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,020
Speaker 1: I'd be like, "Do I know R. Scott Bakker?

579
00:25:03,081 --> 00:25:03,509
Speaker 1: What do you

580
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:03,733
Speaker 1: see?".

581
00:25:04,262 --> 00:25:05,440
Speaker 0: But a lot of nerds I know.

582
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:05,854
Speaker 0: What do you see?

583
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:12,099
Speaker 0: A lot of nerds, especially nerds who are like art nerds, they all read Watership Down when they were young.

584
00:25:12,862 --> 00:25:14,718
Speaker 0: So I feel like I should read it.

585
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:15,452
Speaker 1: Great.

586
00:25:16,283 --> 00:25:17,499
Speaker 1: Or Emily just told you to.

587
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,299
Speaker 0: I have bunnies and Emily really likes that book and I've never read it.

588
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,660
Speaker 0: And I would like to watch the movie, but I should read the book first in my opinion.

589
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:25,940
Speaker 0: So I'm going to read the book and I'm going to watch the movie.

590
00:25:27,052 --> 00:25:27,240
Speaker 1: Whatever.

591
00:25:27,761 --> 00:25:29,199
Speaker 0: Otherwise, PAX South is coming up.

592
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,499
Speaker 0: Hopefully we'll be doing one or two or three panels at it.

593
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,800
Speaker 0: And then right after that is PAX East.

594
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,259
Speaker 0: Badges go on sale soon.

595
00:25:39,442 --> 00:25:40,319
Speaker 0: So watch out for that.

596
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,640
Speaker 0: And then not long after that is PAX Prime.

597
00:25:43,081 --> 00:25:44,399
Speaker 0: And in between the two is Kineticon.

598
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,399
Speaker 1: There's also a magfest that we're not going to.

599
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, magfest is awesome though.

600
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,458
Speaker 0: So if you could not get...

601
00:25:50,762 --> 00:25:52,080
Speaker 1: I heard Rebecca Sugar is going to be a magfest.

602
00:25:52,721 --> 00:25:57,660
Speaker 0: So if you were unable to get badges or hotels to PAX South or PAX South is too far away.

603
00:25:57,881 --> 00:25:58,539
Speaker 1: You should be at magfest.

604
00:25:58,821 --> 00:25:59,520
Speaker 0: You should be at magfest.

605
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:06,117
Speaker 0: Magfest is, in my opinion, the third best gaming convention in the English speaking world.

606
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,220
Speaker 0: Number one is PAX Prime.

607
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:14,740
Speaker 0: PAX OSS as of this year edged out both PAX East and magfest, I think.

608
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,099
Speaker 0: But that's only because PAX OSS has a real...

609
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:22,434
Speaker 1: But you spent all of PAX, he's doing video streaming, so I don't know if your evaluation can really be...

610
00:26:23,001 --> 00:26:26,260
Speaker 0: Ah, but I think we both agree that magfest is more fun than PAX East.

611
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,060
Speaker 1: Maybe.

612
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:37,379
Speaker 0: PAX OSS has, it feels a lot like PAX Prime due to both internal factors and external factors, meaning there's food.

613
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,338
Speaker 1: That's true.

614
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,140
Speaker 0: There's places.

615
00:26:39,961 --> 00:26:40,598
Speaker 0: It's nice to walk around.

616
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,117
Speaker 1: Well now there is.

617
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,200
Speaker 1: There wasn't last year.

618
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,080
Speaker 0: There wasn't last year.

619
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:47,600
Speaker 0: Last year, eh, big top, glad I went, memories, but eh.

620
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,451
Speaker 0: They had this big sign that's like, "Pax OSS 2014, now with less

621
00:26:50,491 --> 00:26:50,652
Speaker 0: tent.".

622
00:26:55,221 --> 00:26:56,632
Speaker 1: They get all that shit right.

623
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,839
Speaker 1: That's the shit they never fuck up.

624
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,619
Speaker 0: Yep, exactly.

625
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:00,413
Speaker 1: Anyway.

626
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:03,300
Speaker 0: So yeah, the election happened.

627
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:10,157
Speaker 0: You probably didn't vote in it because young people just don't fucking vote in midterms and that's why shit's fucked.

628
00:27:10,842 --> 00:27:12,680
Speaker 1: People in the United States don't vote.

629
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:19,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, so those of you who do not live in the United States, to explain this to you, every four years we elect our president.

630
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,240
Speaker 0: That's the only time most of the people who vote, vote ever.

631
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,719
Speaker 1: There are elections every single year on the same day.

632
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:26,208
Speaker 0: Yup.

633
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,520
Speaker 1: That's the first Tuesday of November is the election day.

634
00:27:29,761 --> 00:27:34,316
Speaker 1: Even if it's not the president year, in all those three in between years, there are also votes.

635
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:45,300
Speaker 0: Now every four or six or eight years, there's always either a member of Congress on the governor, or goopener, if you know what I'm referencing.

636
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,618
Speaker 0: Governor races- Or mayors.

637
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:48,430
Speaker 0: Yup.

638
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,679
Speaker 0: Or- State legislatures.

639
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,440
Speaker 1: There's all kinds of judges.

640
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,820
Speaker 0: Judges who run unopposed always.

641
00:27:53,941 --> 00:27:54,660
Speaker 1: Dog catchers.

642
00:27:56,784 --> 00:27:58,539
Speaker 1: So- Sheriffs in some places.

643
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:02,040
Speaker 0: I don't need to explain this because apparently John Oliver just talked about this.

644
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:14,500
Speaker 0: So go watch the most recent John Oliver last week tonight and he explains how almost all actual laws in the US now are passed at the state level because our national politics is completely deadlocked and will be for another two years minimum.

645
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,532
Speaker 0: Probably another 12 years.

646
00:28:17,722 --> 00:28:17,917
Speaker 1: Maybe.

647
00:28:18,723 --> 00:28:19,399
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

648
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:34,020
Speaker 0: So this election happened and the main reason I wanted to talk about this, one, I didn't really want to do a show the day after I got back from Australia, and two, a bunch of our smart friends got tricked and voted the wrong way on a proposition.

649
00:28:34,861 --> 00:28:38,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, afterwards they explained it to them, they actually realized.

650
00:28:38,462 --> 00:28:41,959
Speaker 1: It wasn't a situation where they disagreed with us and they said yes and we said no.

651
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:50,096
Speaker 1: It was a situation where they said yes, we said no, and then when we explained it to them they were like, "Oh shit, I actually wanted to vote

652
00:28:50,156 --> 00:28:50,378
Speaker 1: no.".

653
00:28:50,741 --> 00:28:52,280
Speaker 0: And thus the problem with democracy.

654
00:28:53,403 --> 00:28:54,958
Speaker 0: So, our friends are smart people.

655
00:28:56,563 --> 00:28:57,300
Speaker 0: Smart people.

656
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,220
Speaker 0: People who I know to be smart.

657
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,096
Speaker 1: Who care about voting and voted.

658
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:06,339
Speaker 0: They voted in a midterm election, they care, and they even did some research ahead of time.

659
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:08,920
Speaker 1: They are educated college graduates.

660
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:16,159
Speaker 0: They're worldly, they've been around the block, they have jobs and monies, and are smart people.

661
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:22,580
Speaker 0: And despite reading the bill and researching ahead of time, they voted the wrong way.

662
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,840
Speaker 0: So New York State had three proposals.

663
00:29:27,822 --> 00:29:29,939
Speaker 0: The two they had voted right on, pretty much everyone.

664
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,179
Speaker 1: Sort of, right?

665
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,920
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the second and third ones.

666
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,039
Speaker 0: Proposal two is my favorite one.

667
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:44,899
Speaker 0: Proposal two was, we don't have to print an entire copy of every bill on paper and give it to everyone before we can vote on it.

668
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,399
Speaker 1: That one is a good one to say yes on.

669
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,599
Speaker 1: Obvious reasons.

670
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:58,639
Speaker 1: It's basically saying, allow Albany to do some technology because the Constitution currently forbids using technology.

671
00:30:01,704 --> 00:30:06,473
Speaker 0: And I read, I did some research on the bill just to make sure, like, is there anyone smart opposing it?

672
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:23,240
Speaker 0: And one motherfucker, and the state level, is actually against the bill and argued that it will be to the detriment of the pulp and paper industry, and that that is a huge part of upstate New York.

673
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:27,480
Speaker 0: Pretty sure they were referring to their particular district in upstate New York.

674
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,820
Speaker 0: Luckily, it passed.

675
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:34,260
Speaker 0: We can stop killing a whole bunch of trees for literally no reason.

676
00:30:34,945 --> 00:30:35,600
Speaker 1: So that one was fine.

677
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:40,040
Speaker 1: The third one was, let's basically have a bond, which is a loan.

678
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:55,520
Speaker 1: It's basically borrowing a ton of money, two billion dollars to buy shit for schools, but specifically to buy it for public schools, to buy them fast internets and fancy smart boards and all sorts of technologies that they don't have.

679
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:57,879
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure they're going to waste this fucking money, right?

680
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,540
Speaker 1: That's the thing.

681
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:07,620
Speaker 1: It's like, on the one hand, I was like, I should vote no, because this is probably some deal where the company that makes the smart boards is like, hey, we want like two billion dollars.

682
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:19,360
Speaker 1: So just get the taxpayers to take out a loan and pay interest for it and give us the two billion dollars and we'll sell you a bunch of useless garbage technologies to put in your schools that no teacher actually wants and is useless.

683
00:31:19,964 --> 00:31:21,319
Speaker 1: And I sort of want to say no to that.

684
00:31:21,962 --> 00:31:25,719
Speaker 1: But then I thought, you know, that some kid is going to school and the Internet in his school sucks.

685
00:31:26,381 --> 00:31:37,799
Speaker 1: And even though this horrible companies or whoever contractor is going to make mad corrupt monies on this, at some point, they'll be that kid in school and the school finally has somewhat better Internet.

686
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:38,370
Speaker 1: Yeah.

687
00:31:38,621 --> 00:31:39,556
Speaker 1: And that kid will be like, yes.

688
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:49,359
Speaker 0: And honestly, our schools are so bad at this point that I really want to pump some money in just because that at least fix a few of the grossest problems.

689
00:31:50,012 --> 00:31:50,200
Speaker 1: Yeah.

690
00:31:50,321 --> 00:31:54,638
Speaker 1: And it's like we're going to spend rather spend two billion dollars on this than on something else.

691
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,240
Speaker 0: The people who are going to vote against this are like libertarians.

692
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,180
Speaker 1: I don't think they know nonsense or whatever.

693
00:31:59,344 --> 00:31:59,577
Speaker 1: Yeah.

694
00:31:59,886 --> 00:32:00,437
Speaker 1: Last time.

695
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,519
Speaker 0: The other reason I was for it is while Cuomo's for it and he can eat a big old dick.

696
00:32:05,684 --> 00:32:06,418
Speaker 1: That's what he does.

697
00:32:06,962 --> 00:32:08,939
Speaker 1: In fact, he can and does.

698
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:19,320
Speaker 0: But apparently a bunch of people, mostly conservatives, were against this bill because one of the people who has a lot of over there, oh, they don't want to pay for school.

699
00:32:19,853 --> 00:32:19,938
Speaker 1: No.

700
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:25,820
Speaker 0: One of the people who has a lot of oversight over how the tech like what is bought and how it's used is Eric Schmidt from Google.

701
00:32:26,286 --> 00:32:26,820
Speaker 1: Oh, how about that?

702
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:35,040
Speaker 0: And those people are all mad because they're arguing that Google shouldn't get to, you know, a big corporation should be like if Microsoft that it is sort of corrupt.

703
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:35,700
Speaker 1: That's what I was saying.

704
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:39,118
Speaker 0: Except Google doesn't really sell products.

705
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,119
Speaker 1: Microsoft and Apple actually.

706
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,980
Speaker 1: Mark Microsoft the most sells those kinds of products.

707
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:44,839
Speaker 1: Google doesn't.

708
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,847
Speaker 1: Google doesn't have anything like.

709
00:32:47,289 --> 00:32:50,040
Speaker 1: Google doesn't make a product that they could put that money.

710
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,980
Speaker 0: Google does not have a horse in the race.

711
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,678
Speaker 0: Google has a guy betting on the race.

712
00:32:53,946 --> 00:32:54,139
Speaker 0: Yep.

713
00:32:54,341 --> 00:33:00,040
Speaker 0: Like Google just needs people that like people who use tech more in school are going to be better Google employees down the road.

714
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,380
Speaker 1: I guess they have Google shortcuts on the computer desktops.

715
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:02,880
Speaker 1: I don't know.

716
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,300
Speaker 0: You know what?

717
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:16,259
Speaker 0: Eric Schmidt's the kind of person where if if he has some oversight, I'm at least confident that through all the bureaucracy that's going to prevent any intelligent thing being done with this money, a little bit of good might happen.

718
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, it'll be better than, you know, someone who doesn't know anything about technology.

719
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,620
Speaker 0: I trust him more than I trust anyone in New York state politics.

720
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,960
Speaker 1: I mean, he's not a perfect individual by any means.

721
00:33:26,121 --> 00:33:26,540
Speaker 0: No, he's not.

722
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:29,880
Speaker 1: But what did I easily Google his list of fuck ups?

723
00:33:30,222 --> 00:33:30,859
Speaker 0: What did I say?

724
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,100
Speaker 0: I trust him more than anyone in New York state politics.

725
00:33:33,561 --> 00:33:42,239
Speaker 1: He is a person who, despite being a CEO of one of the largest companies on earth, said, you know, what do you care about privacy if you got nothing to hide?

726
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,240
Speaker 1: So Proposal one, the one that everyone fucked up.

727
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:49,199
Speaker 0: Listen, the correct vote was no.

728
00:33:49,501 --> 00:33:50,939
Speaker 1: The correct vote was no.

729
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:51,566
Speaker 0: He's got an.

730
00:33:51,627 --> 00:33:52,339
Speaker 0: Emily voted no.

731
00:33:52,648 --> 00:33:53,020
Speaker 0: That's right.

732
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,220
Speaker 0: Several of our very smart friends voted yes.

733
00:33:55,860 --> 00:34:02,155
Speaker 0: So I did all my research at the airport waiting for my luggage and then I voted on the way home.

734
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:09,320
Speaker 1: I did my research by following Zephyr Teachout on Twitter because I figured, hey, she didn't win, but she's probably going to tell everyone else how to vote.

735
00:34:09,763 --> 00:34:12,139
Speaker 1: And I already did the research that said I should vote for her.

736
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,632
Speaker 1: So if I'm going to vote for her, I might as well vote.

737
00:34:14,672 --> 00:34:15,699
Speaker 1: however she says to vote.

738
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:17,599
Speaker 1: So that'll make my job real easy.

739
00:34:18,202 --> 00:34:21,239
Speaker 1: And she tweeted many times saying, good God, vote no on one.

740
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:23,420
Speaker 0: I knew one was bad just by reading it.

741
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,520
Speaker 0: And the thing is, this is why it bothers me that smart friends got it wrong.

742
00:34:26,721 --> 00:34:27,500
Speaker 1: Well, it was intentional.

743
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:38,583
Speaker 1: I remember, you know, we get to vote on it, but we don't get the fact that it gets on the ballot and what is written there next to it is controlled by the people who are already elected.

744
00:34:39,167 --> 00:34:41,260
Speaker 1: So you can't trust them to write the correct thing there.

745
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,659
Speaker 1: They're going to use deceptive language.

746
00:34:42,802 --> 00:34:43,759
Speaker 1: And I did now.

747
00:34:44,181 --> 00:34:46,760
Speaker 0: So Emily's logic was basically because we were talking about the bill.

748
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:51,780
Speaker 0: She was like, I read the intense and it was obviously like stopping gerrymandering.

749
00:34:52,501 --> 00:34:58,513
Speaker 0: But then I scroll down, I read like the actual implementation and I was like, wait a minute, intent.

750
00:34:58,533 --> 00:34:59,120
Speaker 0: What did she say?

751
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:05,080
Speaker 0: She basically said either this is just written very badly, like bad board game rules or it's actually nefarious.

752
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,245
Speaker 1: It is nefarious.

753
00:35:06,446 --> 00:35:08,580
Speaker 1: There is no question it was nefarious.

754
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,680
Speaker 0: Revising states redistricting procedure.

755
00:35:12,241 --> 00:35:20,101
Speaker 0: The purpose of this proposal is to reform the process of establishing new state legislative and congressional district lines that the Constitution requires every 10 years.

756
00:35:21,084 --> 00:35:27,739
Speaker 1: So basically and it was we have a process for drawing the districts for the state legislature in New York state.

757
00:35:27,921 --> 00:35:28,143
Speaker 0: Yes.

758
00:35:28,406 --> 00:35:29,880
Speaker 0: The process also Congress.

759
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:30,322
Speaker 1: Yes.

760
00:35:30,402 --> 00:35:34,440
Speaker 1: The existing process is mad, rigged and corrupt.

761
00:35:34,641 --> 00:35:37,560
Speaker 0: And it's run by the Republican and Democratic Party.

762
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,340
Speaker 1: And it's all crazy gerrymandered.

763
00:35:39,421 --> 00:35:40,332
Speaker 1: And we need to fix that.

764
00:35:40,392 --> 00:35:41,040
Speaker 1: That is correct.

765
00:35:41,421 --> 00:35:43,380
Speaker 1: This is your intent is to fix that problem.

766
00:35:43,481 --> 00:35:44,719
Speaker 1: That is a noble intent.

767
00:35:44,981 --> 00:35:49,984
Speaker 0: And the abstract of the bill says we are fixing that with an independent or neutral or whatever commission.

768
00:35:50,426 --> 00:35:52,960
Speaker 1: That sounds good to rule number one of legislation.

769
00:35:53,461 --> 00:35:56,540
Speaker 0: Whatever a bill says, assume it does the opposite unless proven otherwise.

770
00:35:57,181 --> 00:35:59,740
Speaker 0: Whatever this summary is, it's probably the opposite.

771
00:36:00,842 --> 00:36:01,285
Speaker 0: So it's fair.

772
00:36:01,305 --> 00:36:03,519
Speaker 0: And the better it sounds, the worse it probably is.

773
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:12,736
Speaker 0: So basically it replaces the existing system, which is pretty vague and just like the parties sort of.

774
00:36:13,102 --> 00:36:14,540
Speaker 1: So keep in mind this past.

775
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,379
Speaker 1: So this horrible thing is going to happen.

776
00:36:16,921 --> 00:36:18,510
Speaker 0: Yes.

777
00:36:18,731 --> 00:36:20,360
Speaker 0: Instead, they'll form a commission.

778
00:36:20,861 --> 00:36:27,220
Speaker 0: Now, in my research, I discovered that the commission was originally in this legislation called an independent commission.

779
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,342
Speaker 1: It is now not.

780
00:36:28,362 --> 00:36:38,900
Speaker 0: There was a lawsuit that was one saying that because the commission would not be independent, they can't lie and say it would be independent in the law.

781
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:39,381
Speaker 1: Yep.

782
00:36:40,203 --> 00:36:49,538
Speaker 0: That's fucked up that there was a lawsuit against the law and it was one and the law still passed.

783
00:36:49,821 --> 00:36:50,042
Speaker 1: Yep.

784
00:36:50,725 --> 00:36:53,640
Speaker 0: So they were trying to hide what the law did.

785
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:54,884
Speaker 0: They failed.

786
00:36:55,205 --> 00:36:58,059
Speaker 0: And yet they still succeeded in lying about what the law did.

787
00:36:58,881 --> 00:37:07,940
Speaker 0: Basically, what it does is it sets up a commission that's half Democrats and half Republicans and they get to draw the lines.

788
00:37:08,741 --> 00:37:11,220
Speaker 0: However, and this is how you know, the law is bullshit.

789
00:37:11,921 --> 00:37:25,880
Speaker 0: If their proposal is not approved by the legislature twice, the legislature can then modify their proposal as they see fit in order to pass one, meaning the legislature can do whatever the fuck they want.

790
00:37:26,041 --> 00:37:28,939
Speaker 0: Anyway, this commission literally does nothing.

791
00:37:29,321 --> 00:37:29,521
Speaker 1: Yep.

792
00:37:30,465 --> 00:37:32,772
Speaker 0: Even worse, the original system.

793
00:37:33,153 --> 00:37:40,507
Speaker 1: you could be right, because I mean, at that point, from what we've heard so far, you could basically say, well, it basically just adds bureaucracy.

794
00:37:40,608 --> 00:37:41,820
Speaker 1: at worst, right?

795
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:46,439
Speaker 1: The legislature is still going to draw the lines in the end anyway, so it doesn't really matter if you vote yes or no.

796
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:50,440
Speaker 1: So there has to be some other thing going on that would make voting no really important.

797
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:51,383
Speaker 0: Yep.

798
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:54,460
Speaker 0: So the last clause of the new restrictions.

799
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,640
Speaker 0: Well, there are one, two, three.

800
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,680
Speaker 0: There are five restrictions.

801
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:00,800
Speaker 0: The top four are basically already covered by the existing system.

802
00:38:01,303 --> 00:38:02,176
Speaker 0: Don't gerrymander.

803
00:38:03,002 --> 00:38:03,508
Speaker 1: But they do.

804
00:38:03,528 --> 00:38:04,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't matter.

805
00:38:04,841 --> 00:38:05,464
Speaker 0: The fifth one.

806
00:38:05,725 --> 00:38:18,680
Speaker 0: But maybe because it actually says that someone could try to know maintenance of cores of existing districts, of preexisting political subdivisions and of communities of interest must be considered.

807
00:38:19,544 --> 00:38:21,040
Speaker 0: That is not a requirement.

808
00:38:21,321 --> 00:38:22,460
Speaker 0: Well, now it's a requirement.

809
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,564
Speaker 0: It wasn't before.

810
00:38:24,186 --> 00:38:27,960
Speaker 0: So in the old system, reformers could theoretically say, you know what?

811
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,382
Speaker 0: Fuck it.

812
00:38:28,664 --> 00:38:30,960
Speaker 0: Let's have a computer and redraw everything randomly.

813
00:38:31,821 --> 00:38:32,985
Speaker 0: This prevents that.

814
00:38:33,005 --> 00:38:36,799
Speaker 0: the existing gerrymandering is the best we can ever get now.

815
00:38:37,521 --> 00:38:40,099
Speaker 0: We can never be less gerrymandered than we already are.

816
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,255
Speaker 1: It's locks it in.

817
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,140
Speaker 1: So someone can't like, you know, if this commission and the legislature both.

818
00:38:46,662 --> 00:38:46,782
Speaker 1: Right.

819
00:38:46,802 --> 00:38:48,029
Speaker 1: Let's say we vote in all new.

820
00:38:48,109 --> 00:38:50,723
Speaker 1: somehow miracle happens with the current gerrymandered districts.

821
00:38:50,784 --> 00:38:52,899
Speaker 1: People in New York State move a whole bunch.

822
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:56,780
Speaker 0: We vote in like all like Green Party, Green Party and Libertarians.

823
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:03,380
Speaker 1: A bunch of old people die and a bunch of people move and we still have the same districts and we vote in awesome people and they make an awesome commission.

824
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:08,803
Speaker 1: And that commission draws an awesome, just like crazy grid of awesomeness that is not gerrymandered.

825
00:39:08,904 --> 00:39:12,580
Speaker 0: One, they violated the law, so their proposals invalid.

826
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:18,323
Speaker 1: And even if the legislature approves it, we would need another similar constitutional referendum.

827
00:39:18,544 --> 00:39:24,179
Speaker 1: So we'd also have to vote yes, no on a thing like this again in order to go back and undo this.

828
00:39:24,381 --> 00:39:25,980
Speaker 0: So this bill is bad for two reasons.

829
00:39:26,382 --> 00:39:30,800
Speaker 0: One, it is fake reform intended to deflect attention on gerrymandering.

830
00:39:31,261 --> 00:39:39,078
Speaker 0: Basically, all the people who voted for this and like proponents of it in the state can now say, look, I backed the reform bill to fix gerrymandering.

831
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:42,340
Speaker 0: And two, so it's fake reform because it doesn't actually do anything.

832
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:47,983
Speaker 1: And it's basically when I put on my TV commercial, I'd be like, I tried to go against gerrymandering.

833
00:39:48,003 --> 00:39:51,100
Speaker 0: Joey Jojo voted against it because he's pro gerrymandering.

834
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:51,581
Speaker 1: Yeah.

835
00:39:52,243 --> 00:39:58,963
Speaker 0: And two, it actually entrenches gerrymandering forever, but pretends that it is fixing it.

836
00:39:59,868 --> 00:40:02,240
Speaker 0: So how did our friends get fooled?

837
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:08,000
Speaker 1: Because when I read this, they can't read or they didn't read carefully because I school I school lawyer to its lawyer text.

838
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,098
Speaker 1: No one knows how to read it.

839
00:40:09,382 --> 00:40:11,460
Speaker 0: I did, but I read the actual bill.

840
00:40:11,803 --> 00:40:13,420
Speaker 0: And at the bottom, where is it?

841
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:13,843
Speaker 0: Where is it?

842
00:40:13,863 --> 00:40:15,840
Speaker 0: There's the line where I knew it was bullshit.

843
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:19,200
Speaker 0: A hundred percent where I can't find it.

844
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:21,420
Speaker 0: The speaker is so right reading.

845
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,242
Speaker 0: Here it is.

846
00:40:22,705 --> 00:40:26,877
Speaker 0: If the speaker of the assembly and the temporary president, the Senate belong to different parties, blah, blah, blah.

847
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,740
Speaker 1: And you haven't fallen asleep by the time you've gotten to this line.

848
00:40:30,241 --> 00:40:33,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, but basically what the line says, I'm trying to find it.

849
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,599
Speaker 1: And that's not the line you skip over because it's so boring.

850
00:40:36,241 --> 00:40:36,503
Speaker 0: Yeah.

851
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:39,260
Speaker 0: It basically says that the legislature.

852
00:40:40,882 --> 00:40:44,238
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, proposed amendment, 60 day deadline, which the court must decide.

853
00:40:44,278 --> 00:40:46,271
Speaker 0: a petition challenging an apportionment plan would be.

854
00:40:46,291 --> 00:40:51,660
Speaker 0: it would provide the legislature with an opportunity to correct any legal problems the court finds with a redistricting plan.

855
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,739
Speaker 0: Guys, if you can read the rules to a board game, you can read this.

856
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:04,480
Speaker 0: Maybe this is why we're doing our panel on learning games at Pac South, probably because no one we know reads the rules to board games.

857
00:41:04,801 --> 00:41:06,259
Speaker 0: We have to explain the rules to them.

858
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:10,684
Speaker 0: Apparently, no one reads the rules to government and we have to explain that to them to right now.

859
00:41:10,764 --> 00:41:17,319
Speaker 1: Imagine being an actual representative in a legislature somewhere on the town state, whatever level you are.

860
00:41:17,521 --> 00:41:19,459
Speaker 0: Now, you might say, well, I'll read the bills.

861
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:23,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, you won't because you have to spend 90 percent of your time fundraising.

862
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:23,402
Speaker 1: Right.

863
00:41:23,542 --> 00:41:29,100
Speaker 1: Oh, not only that, even if you had time to read them, they're all worded like this only 10 times longer.

864
00:41:30,103 --> 00:41:31,279
Speaker 1: And you fucked up reading this.

865
00:41:31,701 --> 00:41:39,204
Speaker 1: How the hell if you were elected today, how the hell would you read any bill and understand its full consequences if you couldn't even read this tiny referendum thingy?

866
00:41:39,305 --> 00:41:40,960
Speaker 0: I think I know how to fix this correctly.

867
00:41:41,382 --> 00:41:42,740
Speaker 0: I think I know how to fix this one problem.

868
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,404
Speaker 0: I got a crazy.

869
00:41:43,544 --> 00:41:45,900
Speaker 0: this is this is usually you're the one who's like, I know how to fix this.

870
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:51,400
Speaker 1: So I'm going to Scott, I'm going to pull the rim, then I'm going to find all the reasons that you're going to shut me down.

871
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:51,965
Speaker 1: That's right.

872
00:41:51,985 --> 00:41:53,499
Speaker 0: So here's my idea.

873
00:41:54,002 --> 00:41:56,420
Speaker 0: So, you know, in school, we study literature.

874
00:41:58,423 --> 00:41:59,329
Speaker 0: And we study movies.

875
00:41:59,369 --> 00:42:02,957
Speaker 0: sometimes, like in high school, like you watch a movie and you'll read a book and you'll like write a paper on it.

876
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,632
Speaker 0: People in school, like high school should do the same thing.

877
00:42:06,672 --> 00:42:11,879
Speaker 0: for games, like in English class, someone should have to play like Half-Life 2 and write a paper on it.

878
00:42:12,742 --> 00:42:12,882
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

879
00:42:13,465 --> 00:42:15,193
Speaker 1: And how is that going to help with this situation?

880
00:42:15,354 --> 00:42:19,240
Speaker 1: and how is that ever going to happen until we're like 90 years old?

881
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,340
Speaker 1: There'll be enough old people dead for that to happen.

882
00:42:21,642 --> 00:42:23,300
Speaker 1: And then kids will think it's mad boring.

883
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,441
Speaker 1: Half-Life 2 will be like fucking Citizen Kane and they'll be like, what the fuck is this shit?

884
00:42:26,762 --> 00:42:30,239
Speaker 1: I want to go do my, you know, feelies with the, you know, VR.

885
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,144
Speaker 1: All right.

886
00:42:31,184 --> 00:42:33,140
Speaker 0: So to pull a Scott and I'll have to escalate.

887
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,959
Speaker 0: So, yes, all that happens.

888
00:42:35,141 --> 00:42:37,300
Speaker 0: We like kill all the old people with guns or something.

889
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,179
Speaker 1: So no, we are the old people.

890
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,740
Speaker 1: There aren't the old people who are in our way are gone.

891
00:42:41,984 --> 00:42:42,839
Speaker 0: So we make it happen.

892
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:50,280
Speaker 0: But we also like in math class or game class, you have to play some tabletop games and like learning the rules.

893
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,460
Speaker 1: Tabletop games will still exist.

894
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,959
Speaker 1: You won't just play them in cyberspace.

895
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're virtual tabletop games in cyberspace.

896
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,428
Speaker 0: There's a table.

897
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:58,040
Speaker 0: So you got to learn the rules of these games.

898
00:42:58,561 --> 00:43:04,100
Speaker 1: And while these laws, you know, and then we'll finally fix gerrymandering and nobody will care because they were living in cyberspace.

899
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:04,561
Speaker 1: Yeah.

900
00:43:04,683 --> 00:43:06,120
Speaker 1: And cyberspace laws all that matter.

901
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:18,379
Speaker 0: No, there's a culture book about that where the machines, the AIs, the intelligences, the minds are like, yeah, in our in our Internet, which we call infinite fun space, we have infinite fun all the time.

902
00:43:18,682 --> 00:43:19,398
Speaker 1: The best space.

903
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:31,180
Speaker 0: But because the physical world like something could blow us up back there, we have to at least keep an eye pointing at that to keep an eye on all that shit and take turns.

904
00:43:31,623 --> 00:43:33,239
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically that's what they do.

905
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:50,460
Speaker 0: So if people had to learn rules to games by reading them, my idea is that the same percentage of those people who learn how to read rules as actually learn math from math math class would now be able to parse these laws.

906
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,980
Speaker 1: I do not think the percentage would increase anyway.

907
00:43:54,761 --> 00:43:57,480
Speaker 0: I think it would increase, but I think it'd be like the one to two percent increase.

908
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,314
Speaker 1: I mean, if you just improve education in general, I mean, that your specific class isn't really helping.

909
00:44:02,396 --> 00:44:02,580
Speaker 1: Right.

910
00:44:02,741 --> 00:44:05,700
Speaker 1: It's it, you know, it's just education in general.

911
00:44:06,162 --> 00:44:10,722
Speaker 1: I mean, and there was, in fact, an English class, I think, in 10th grade, we actually had to.

912
00:44:11,224 --> 00:44:19,584
Speaker 1: there was an assignment where we had to read and write instructions to things as if you were explaining it to someone who knew absolutely nothing other than the English language.

913
00:44:19,604 --> 00:44:21,160
Speaker 0: There was a Science Olympiad event.

914
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,788
Speaker 0: I don't know if it exists where.

915
00:44:22,848 --> 00:44:28,000
Speaker 1: what would happen is they give you an object and you had any any proper nouns related to the task or unknown.

916
00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:29,638
Speaker 1: You had to teach those.

917
00:44:30,461 --> 00:44:40,540
Speaker 1: So it's like to be like it'd be like teach someone how to like peel a banana and write those instructions, but you can't use the following words unless you explain what those words are somehow.

918
00:44:40,981 --> 00:44:45,662
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had assignments like that, but because it was taboo, basically like here's a list of words.

919
00:44:45,682 --> 00:44:47,998
Speaker 0: you can't use a thesaurus later.

920
00:44:50,242 --> 00:44:51,368
Speaker 0: But our event was more.

921
00:44:51,771 --> 00:44:53,360
Speaker 0: you just have to describe a process.

922
00:44:53,882 --> 00:44:58,105
Speaker 0: So like here's an object, write instructions on how to build that object from those materials.

923
00:44:58,429 --> 00:44:59,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, peeling banana.

924
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:04,460
Speaker 1: It's like, all right, there's going to be a yellow object in front of you shaped, you know, vaguely crescent shaped.

925
00:45:04,603 --> 00:45:05,420
Speaker 1: That is the banana.

926
00:45:06,121 --> 00:45:13,249
Speaker 1: The banana is an harder outer coating, you know, which is the peel protecting the mushy inside part that you can't see.

927
00:45:13,269 --> 00:45:14,860
Speaker 1: yet on one end of the banana.

928
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:21,420
Speaker 0: I would say a stick bite it and keep biting it and swallow all the parts that you can actually swallow without choking spit out all the other parts.

929
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:21,761
Speaker 1: Yes.

930
00:45:21,822 --> 00:45:23,213
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's that's my that's my.

931
00:45:23,234 --> 00:45:23,980
Speaker 0: you know what that is.

932
00:45:24,181 --> 00:45:25,838
Speaker 0: That's my loop optimized version.

933
00:45:26,263 --> 00:45:27,253
Speaker 1: Mm hmm.

934
00:45:27,314 --> 00:45:27,779
Speaker 1: Very good.

935
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:40,900
Speaker 1: So otherwise, I actually voted for almost all Green Party candidates because I voted for the Green Party person on the governor just to be, you know, obscenity.

936
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:41,637
Speaker 0: Fuck you, Cuomo.

937
00:45:42,761 --> 00:45:46,000
Speaker 0: And then I would have rather let the Republicans burn it down.

938
00:45:46,421 --> 00:45:46,763
Speaker 0: Yes.

939
00:45:47,024 --> 00:45:49,360
Speaker 0: It like I would rather the Republican have won than Cuomo.

940
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,740
Speaker 1: So I guess people who aren't from New York don't know this story.

941
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:56,634
Speaker 1: So Cuomo is basically the only reason he's governor, his name recognition, because his father was governor.

942
00:45:56,654 --> 00:45:56,715
Speaker 0: Yep.

943
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:01,982
Speaker 0: So name recognition is basically all that matters unless like you get your dick out in public.

944
00:46:02,002 --> 00:46:04,922
Speaker 1: I bet people probably don't even know that it's a different person than his father, whatever.

945
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:10,244
Speaker 1: Anyway, he's governor and he was basically having a fight with Republicans.

946
00:46:10,284 --> 00:46:12,280
Speaker 1: He wanted to do something and they didn't want to do it.

947
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:17,720
Speaker 1: So he said, all right, if you don't do it, I'm going to create this corruption commission that's going to find all your corruptions and get you in trouble.

948
00:46:18,021 --> 00:46:24,056
Speaker 0: And that corruption commission, much like the choo choo bomb in Smash Brothers, came right back at it.

949
00:46:24,117 --> 00:46:24,300
Speaker 1: Right.

950
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:31,280
Speaker 1: So the corruption commission, you know, was finding stuff out and then the Republicans eventually like, OK, OK, you win, stop with the corruption thing.

951
00:46:31,741 --> 00:46:31,982
Speaker 1: Right.

952
00:46:32,244 --> 00:46:35,099
Speaker 1: We were going to come with the compromise and they got the deal done.

953
00:46:35,601 --> 00:46:37,219
Speaker 1: She said, OK, now the deal's been made.

954
00:46:37,726 --> 00:46:38,620
Speaker 1: I don't need you anymore.

955
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,559
Speaker 1: Corruption commission.

956
00:46:40,521 --> 00:46:46,280
Speaker 1: But meanwhile, the corruption commission was not only investigating the things the Republicans did, they're investigating corrupt things he did.

957
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,165
Speaker 0: I want to talk to the people.

958
00:46:47,185 --> 00:46:49,160
Speaker 1: That's why he took that corruption commission down.

959
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,879
Speaker 0: I want to talk to people on that commission because those are the Eliot Nessus.

960
00:46:52,221 --> 00:46:52,522
Speaker 1: Right.

961
00:46:52,904 --> 00:46:59,960
Speaker 1: So even though Eliot Nessus was a super dick in real life, he in fact said at one point publicly, this corruption commission can investigate any corruption whatsoever.

962
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:00,888
Speaker 1: That's totally cool.

963
00:47:00,928 --> 00:47:02,060
Speaker 1: And they were investigating him.

964
00:47:02,121 --> 00:47:03,137
Speaker 1: And that's when he shut him down.

965
00:47:03,961 --> 00:47:06,859
Speaker 1: So independent of that doesn't really get much more corrupt than that.

966
00:47:07,301 --> 00:47:08,309
Speaker 0: Independent of that.

967
00:47:08,329 --> 00:47:09,880
Speaker 1: And people voted for this person for governor.

968
00:47:10,321 --> 00:47:14,760
Speaker 0: Again, more people live in New York City, like in our area than the rest of the state.

969
00:47:14,961 --> 00:47:15,423
Speaker 1: That's correct.

970
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:22,200
Speaker 0: But the rest of the state has undue representation due to shenanigans because it's full of old people and gerrymandering.

971
00:47:22,981 --> 00:47:35,961
Speaker 0: And because of the way the state constitution is, New York City can't do some things on its own like minimum wages in the city, rent controls in the city, speed limits in the city.

972
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:37,519
Speaker 1: Even the MTA is a state deal.

973
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:49,180
Speaker 0: I guess that technically, but I mean, MTA trains go upstate, but still, so the subways don't need state approval to do really internal things like lower the speed limit because a lot of people are getting hit by cars.

974
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,179
Speaker 1: We actually won that one.

975
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:50,604
Speaker 0: We did.

976
00:47:51,111 --> 00:47:51,739
Speaker 1: Not that it's helping.

977
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:56,419
Speaker 0: Cuomo and the state have fought de Blasio and the city at every turn.

978
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:00,804
Speaker 1: Basically, the interests of the state and the interests of the city are basically 100 percent opposed.

979
00:48:01,367 --> 00:48:04,724
Speaker 1: What New York City wants and what New York State wants from New York City are the opposite.

980
00:48:04,764 --> 00:48:08,541
Speaker 0: Part of it's because it's way cheaper to lobby the state than the city.

981
00:48:09,144 --> 00:48:15,540
Speaker 0: So real estate lobbies do all their lobbying at the state level, and then the state prevents rent and land reform in the city.

982
00:48:15,661 --> 00:48:17,220
Speaker 1: I mean, you go to the state legislature.

983
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,040
Speaker 1: How many how many people in the state legislature are from New York City?

984
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:20,741
Speaker 1: Right.

985
00:48:20,923 --> 00:48:22,560
Speaker 0: You know, how many people even know the majority?

986
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,900
Speaker 0: New York City is not the capital of New York State.

987
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:31,880
Speaker 1: You go around and you convince a bunch of people who are from the sticks to do a certain thing that benefits the stakes and hurts the city.

988
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,700
Speaker 1: And they're all like, oh, absolutely.

989
00:48:33,841 --> 00:48:34,751
Speaker 1: I'll do that, of course.

990
00:48:34,832 --> 00:48:35,640
Speaker 1: Oh, and you gave me money.

991
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:36,250
Speaker 1: How awesome is that?

992
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:36,859
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll do that.

993
00:48:37,301 --> 00:48:40,940
Speaker 1: And then the city doesn't have a majority of representatives in there.

994
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:44,240
Speaker 1: So the city can't just, you know, force the state to do whatever it wants.

995
00:48:44,883 --> 00:48:47,780
Speaker 1: So that's basically a bunch of people in the sticks.

996
00:48:48,542 --> 00:48:51,600
Speaker 1: I decide what happens in New York City because we're in the same state.

997
00:48:51,921 --> 00:48:52,483
Speaker 0: I voted.

998
00:48:52,503 --> 00:48:59,599
Speaker 0: I also honestly, as much as I hated Cuomo, I voted for the green because I was pretty sure the Republican wouldn't actually win anyway.

999
00:49:00,742 --> 00:49:04,580
Speaker 0: And for comptroller, I voted for the green person because I did some research.

1000
00:49:05,762 --> 00:49:07,518
Speaker 0: They they sound like one of us.

1001
00:49:08,582 --> 00:49:16,281
Speaker 0: They were like, just legalize marijuana and everything else to just go crazy on everything like radical, radical, crazy reform, because pretty much what's going on there.

1002
00:49:16,401 --> 00:49:22,059
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't really vote in the rest of them because I wrote myself in on everything that was unopposed.

1003
00:49:23,663 --> 00:49:25,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, all basically everything was unopposed.

1004
00:49:25,944 --> 00:49:27,180
Speaker 1: And I'm thinking right.

1005
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,579
Speaker 1: So there are all these unopposed judges.

1006
00:49:28,741 --> 00:49:29,044
Speaker 1: Why don't?

1007
00:49:29,064 --> 00:49:30,640
Speaker 0: why doesn't one of us like right.

1008
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:34,140
Speaker 1: What does it take to run for judge certain number of signatures on a petition?

1009
00:49:34,521 --> 00:49:34,702
Speaker 1: Right.

1010
00:49:34,762 --> 00:49:37,999
Speaker 1: So if I ran for judge, could I win?

1011
00:49:38,602 --> 00:49:41,860
Speaker 1: And if I did win, I don't know anything about judging.

1012
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:45,180
Speaker 1: I would be like, you know what that means?

1013
00:49:45,641 --> 00:49:48,760
Speaker 1: My job was just to judge things like based on my judgment.

1014
00:49:49,041 --> 00:49:50,280
Speaker 0: You're really good at that, Scott.

1015
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:52,360
Speaker 0: You were perhaps the most judgmental person I know.

1016
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,999
Speaker 1: I think I could do a pretty good job.

1017
00:49:54,421 --> 00:50:01,128
Speaker 1: And, you know, I think people would want to be defendants in my courtroom, but I don't think that I would be good at.

1018
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:05,900
Speaker 1: I think every case that came to my court would then get appealed to some other court and fixed because I'd be bad at it.

1019
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:08,199
Speaker 1: And it would cost the state a lot of money just to have me as judge.

1020
00:50:08,722 --> 00:50:12,940
Speaker 1: So but it's not illegal for me to run for judge despite lack of legal ability.

1021
00:50:13,361 --> 00:50:15,379
Speaker 1: And if I won, I would be the judge.

1022
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,220
Speaker 1: And then what the fuck would happen?

1023
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,399
Speaker 1: Would that be my job now?

1024
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,307
Speaker 1: Do I get paid enough to do that all day?

1025
00:50:20,528 --> 00:50:21,451
Speaker 1: or like?

1026
00:50:21,933 --> 00:50:24,671
Speaker 1: how do I judge things like I don't even know to wear a robe?

1027
00:50:24,712 --> 00:50:25,440
Speaker 1: Can I be like, you know what?

1028
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,329
Speaker 1: My courtroom, no robe.

1029
00:50:27,136 --> 00:50:27,419
Speaker 1: Take that.

1030
00:50:27,901 --> 00:50:30,520
Speaker 0: You would either be the best or the worst judge that New York has ever.

1031
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:31,780
Speaker 1: I'd be the awesomest judge.

1032
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:32,182
Speaker 1: Good.

1033
00:50:32,222 --> 00:50:33,980
Speaker 0: There's no middle ground with you on that.

1034
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:37,320
Speaker 1: But I mean, regardless of if it's me or not, somebody.

1035
00:50:37,461 --> 00:50:41,320
Speaker 1: Just imagine anyone who doesn't know how to be a judge being elected judge.

1036
00:50:41,461 --> 00:50:42,413
Speaker 1: How the fuck do you do it?

1037
00:50:42,858 --> 00:50:42,980
Speaker 1: Right.

1038
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:43,242
Speaker 1: It's not.

1039
00:50:43,282 --> 00:50:45,340
Speaker 1: being representative is actually easier than being judge.

1040
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,278
Speaker 1: You don't need to know anything.

1041
00:50:46,921 --> 00:50:47,243
Speaker 1: You can.

1042
00:50:47,263 --> 00:50:53,779
Speaker 1: you just have to vote on stuff, which is, you know, something I feel pretty confident and even a reasonably intelligent person can learn to do.

1043
00:50:54,402 --> 00:50:56,540
Speaker 1: But being a judge is actually a skill based job.

1044
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:00,908
Speaker 1: That'd be like, what if I got voted as crane operator and I knew nothing about operating cranes?

1045
00:51:01,009 --> 00:51:01,719
Speaker 1: People would die.

1046
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,720
Speaker 1: What if I got voted as train engineer?

1047
00:51:04,122 --> 00:51:06,379
Speaker 1: Now I next day I have to go to the train and make it go.

1048
00:51:07,103 --> 00:51:09,920
Speaker 1: People would not get to work on time if they got there alive.

1049
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:11,598
Speaker 1: Yeah, it would be bad.

1050
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:14,760
Speaker 0: Or you start optimizing for the wrong thing.

1051
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,620
Speaker 1: And what do you do in places where you can run for sheriff?

1052
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,040
Speaker 1: What if I get voted sheriff and I know nothing about policing?

1053
00:51:20,022 --> 00:51:21,119
Speaker 0: That could be kind of fun.

1054
00:51:21,942 --> 00:51:23,520
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm sure I could figure it out eventually.

1055
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:31,943
Speaker 0: Probably easier than judge, but I didn't look at the actual numbers, but I should go find like how many people voted for that one Elliot, whatever who's running completely unopposed.

1056
00:51:32,404 --> 00:51:36,100
Speaker 0: And then we just got to figure out could like if we put you up.

1057
00:51:36,702 --> 00:51:38,460
Speaker 0: And just ran a purely Internet campaign.

1058
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:48,880
Speaker 1: No, not if we could run a real campaign is only a so small area to purely Internet campaign because all the other people in a story to vote for.

1059
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:49,521
Speaker 0: Yes.

1060
00:51:50,143 --> 00:52:01,179
Speaker 0: You go to every nerd and young person thing be like, just lie to just be like, I will do everything in my power to legalize marijuana if I'm elected to the position that has no control over that.

1061
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:05,923
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, something we could really do is just run in the Democratic primary for judge.

1062
00:52:06,727 --> 00:52:08,378
Speaker 1: And then if you're in the D slot, you're on.

1063
00:52:09,221 --> 00:52:09,602
Speaker 1: That's it.

1064
00:52:09,823 --> 00:52:13,153
Speaker 0: Yeah, I I actually am changing my.

1065
00:52:13,434 --> 00:52:16,819
Speaker 0: well, I did change my party affiliation because I was unaffiliated takes a whole year.

1066
00:52:17,141 --> 00:52:17,423
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1067
00:52:17,664 --> 00:52:20,440
Speaker 0: For a long time, because fuck the Democrats.

1068
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:21,445
Speaker 1: Fuck everyone.

1069
00:52:21,666 --> 00:52:23,399
Speaker 0: Yeah, but so.

1070
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:28,400
Speaker 0: Democrat primaries are the only actual elections, the real election.

1071
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,399
Speaker 1: Your vote counts a lot.

1072
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:30,063
Speaker 0: Yep.

1073
00:52:30,525 --> 00:52:33,500
Speaker 0: So, yeah, I got to be in their stupid party.

1074
00:52:34,104 --> 00:52:36,100
Speaker 0: And I don't think parties should get the party power.

1075
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:36,563
Speaker 0: They do.

1076
00:52:36,805 --> 00:52:38,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, they can exist just fine.

1077
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:38,722
Speaker 0: They shouldn't.

1078
00:52:39,024 --> 00:52:43,007
Speaker 0: the state and they sit in the government should not run their primaries for them.

1079
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:44,040
Speaker 1: So now here's the thing.

1080
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:46,240
Speaker 1: If you get elected judge, what kind of judge are you?

1081
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,280
Speaker 1: Am I doing traffic court?

1082
00:52:47,441 --> 00:52:48,991
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

1083
00:52:49,031 --> 00:52:50,260
Speaker 1: like what court am I judging in?

1084
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:51,398
Speaker 0: You know what my problem is?

1085
00:52:52,021 --> 00:52:59,799
Speaker 0: I knew that I knew about what those positions did in Michigan, and I never looked up the differences between Michigan and New York when I moved here.

1086
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:02,520
Speaker 1: I'm glad they were unopposed because then I don't feel bad for not knowing.

1087
00:53:02,661 --> 00:53:02,983
Speaker 1: Yup.

1088
00:53:03,083 --> 00:53:05,680
Speaker 0: I only do research uneducatedly if it could matter.

1089
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:11,304
Speaker 0: And I considered unopposed all the elections where it was like a Democrat and then like a libertarian.

1090
00:53:12,209 --> 00:53:13,738
Speaker 0: Those libertarians got like 40 votes.

1091
00:53:15,581 --> 00:53:19,479
Speaker 0: Green Party actually for governor got almost like five percent of the vote.

1092
00:53:19,981 --> 00:53:20,323
Speaker 1: It's third.

1093
00:53:20,343 --> 00:53:24,470
Speaker 1: There's a lot of hippies in this state in the city, you know, they're voting for that shit.

1094
00:53:24,736 --> 00:53:24,920
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1095
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,003
Speaker 0: My big hope is I want to see Zephyr teach out, bust out and next time there's a big election.

1096
00:53:30,405 --> 00:53:32,860
Speaker 0: I have a feeling she's not going to try to go for governor or anything, though.

1097
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,020
Speaker 0: No, she's probably going to go straight to national politics.

1098
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,790
Speaker 0: Oh, maybe that's the common trajectory.

1099
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:40,181
Speaker 0: is people go for governor or like something like that.

1100
00:53:40,221 --> 00:53:44,848
Speaker 1: Run for House of Representatives in my district and get rid of this Maloney lady who's not the greatest.

1101
00:53:45,412 --> 00:53:46,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, she's not the worst.

1102
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,440
Speaker 0: She's just Gennaro.

1103
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:48,860
Speaker 1: She's not the greatest either.

1104
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:49,321
Speaker 0: Yup.

1105
00:53:50,529 --> 00:53:52,180
Speaker 0: So, yeah, that's politics.

1106
00:53:53,501 --> 00:53:54,129
Speaker 0: See you next week.

1107
00:53:54,412 --> 00:53:54,999
Speaker 0: Talk about Pax.

1108
00:53:56,526 --> 00:53:57,340
Speaker 1: Live somewhere better.

1109
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:05,810
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.
