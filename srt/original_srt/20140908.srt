1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,378
Speaker 0: It's Monday, September 8th, 2014.

2
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:12,521
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,882 --> 00:00:14,045
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,225 --> 00:00:15,569
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:17,433
Speaker 0: Tonight, upgrading computers.

6
00:00:18,356 --> 00:00:19,440
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:20,282 --> 00:00:23,754
Speaker 0: Because somehow we never talked about that, at least not as a topic.

8
00:00:23,834 --> 00:00:24,417
Speaker 1: Are you sure?

9
00:00:24,437 --> 00:00:26,304
Speaker 0: I did a cursory search.

10
00:00:26,565 --> 00:00:27,508
Speaker 1: That's about all we ever do.

11
00:00:27,729 --> 00:00:27,890
Speaker 0: Yeah.

12
00:00:29,511 --> 00:00:33,468
Speaker 0: Interestingly, I could not find an episode we'd ever done on hacking as a concept.

13
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:36,905
Speaker 1: Because it becomes a pedantic argument about, "Whoa, that's not hacking.

14
00:00:36,945 --> 00:00:37,629
Speaker 1: Hacking is this.

15
00:00:37,669 --> 00:00:38,071
Speaker 1: Hacking is

16
00:00:38,091 --> 00:00:38,252
Speaker 1: this.".

17
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:44,960
Speaker 0: Scott, I believe that if you and I were to discuss hacking, we would not in fact get into a stupid and pedantic argument.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,887
Speaker 1: No, but everyone listening would be, "Whatever we decided the definition of hacking was, people would be like, 'That's not

19
00:00:49,927 --> 00:00:50,329
Speaker 1: hacking.'".

20
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:50,992
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

21
00:00:51,253 --> 00:00:51,795
Speaker 0: Fuck them.

22
00:00:51,836 --> 00:00:52,619
Speaker 1: That's cracking.

23
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:53,462
Speaker 1: That's modding.

24
00:00:53,502 --> 00:00:56,793
Speaker 1: That's a hack, but it's not hacking or a hacker.

25
00:00:57,014 --> 00:00:57,575
Speaker 0: Fuck them.

26
00:00:57,595 --> 00:00:58,638
Speaker 0: Yeah.

27
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:02,588
Speaker 1: We'd have to be more, you know, anyway.

28
00:01:02,768 --> 00:01:03,370
Speaker 0: More what?

29
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:05,473
Speaker 1: More defensive.

30
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:08,040
Speaker 0: So we'd have to be hacking.

31
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,976
Speaker 0: colon the act of breaking into systems to which you do not have authorized access.

32
00:01:14,016 --> 00:01:14,798
Speaker 1: You mean cracking?

33
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:16,663
Speaker 0: No, cracking is...

34
00:01:16,683 --> 00:01:20,074
Speaker 1: This is why we're not doing that show.

35
00:01:20,094 --> 00:01:20,898
Speaker 0: So you got any news?

36
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:23,590
Speaker 1: Well, there's a big Apple news tomorrow.

37
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,515
Speaker 1: Tomorrow's Apple Day.

38
00:01:24,656 --> 00:01:26,225
Speaker 0: Oh no, there's gonna be another iPhone.

39
00:01:26,265 --> 00:01:29,238
Speaker 1: Most of you are listening to this tomorrow, meaning today's Apple Day.

40
00:01:29,258 --> 00:01:30,603
Speaker 0: iPhone.

41
00:01:30,764 --> 00:01:41,643
Speaker 1: When I was driving home from a weekend getaway, we crossed midtown to get to the 59th Street Bridge and we passed by the Apple store and there were people waiting yesterday, which was the 7th.

42
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:45,922
Speaker 0: Guys, you just wait like a couple days and just walk into an Apple store.

43
00:01:45,942 --> 00:01:46,727
Speaker 1: My contract doesn't run out.

44
00:01:46,768 --> 00:01:49,082
Speaker 1: See, last year I waited a bit before getting the iPhone.

45
00:01:49,162 --> 00:01:51,935
Speaker 1: Well, two years ago I waited a bit before getting an iPhone 5.

46
00:01:51,935 --> 00:01:56,732
Speaker 1: So now my contract ends in October, so I can just chill out and pick it up in October.

47
00:01:56,752 --> 00:01:57,194
Speaker 1: Yeah.

48
00:01:57,957 --> 00:02:01,850
Speaker 0: I'm waiting because my phone works fine and I'd like a new phone.

49
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,440
Speaker 0: And I don't have to buy one right now.

50
00:02:04,922 --> 00:02:11,590
Speaker 0: And last time I checked, the best phone I could get in terms of being relatively small and not shitty was the Moto X Developer Edition.

51
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:18,212
Speaker 0: Because that was actually cheaper than the regular Moto X. that was just worse in every possible way.

52
00:02:18,774 --> 00:02:18,975
Speaker 1: Cool.

53
00:02:19,115 --> 00:02:22,867
Speaker 1: So let's talk about some other hardware that is announced-ish.

54
00:02:23,128 --> 00:02:26,581
Speaker 0: You sent me a picture of a Drobo looking thing.

55
00:02:26,902 --> 00:02:27,604
Speaker 1: So I didn't know.

56
00:02:27,624 --> 00:02:34,573
Speaker 1: TiVo was like still a thing, but apparently it is because people get DVRs that aren't the shitty ones that are attached to their cable plan.

57
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:34,994
Speaker 0: Wow.

58
00:02:35,095 --> 00:02:38,024
Speaker 0: I imagine TiVo as being like Nectar and Adventure Time.

59
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:42,476
Speaker 1: So this is the TiVo's new product, the TiVo Mega.

60
00:02:42,516 --> 00:02:43,198
Speaker 1: It's $5,000.

61
00:02:43,198 --> 00:02:51,358
Speaker 1: It looks like 10 hard drives in it, which is about $1,000 worth.

62
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:55,049
Speaker 0: It's like a fucking 4U rack mount device.

63
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:58,546
Speaker 1: And then it's got a computer in it, so given the benefit of the doubt, that computer's $2,000.

64
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:00,574
Speaker 0: Who is this aimed at already?

65
00:03:00,775 --> 00:03:01,317
Speaker 0: Rack mount!

66
00:03:01,357 --> 00:03:02,100
Speaker 0: Who has a rack?

67
00:03:02,401 --> 00:03:07,826
Speaker 1: And then I guess you're paying for TiVo software and stuff, so I'll give you a few hundred for that.

68
00:03:07,906 --> 00:03:11,721
Speaker 1: So there's like a $1,500 markup on this thing, at least, if not more.

69
00:03:12,002 --> 00:03:20,710
Speaker 0: The huge server-sized TiVo contains a whopping 24 terabytes of storage in a RAID 5 arrangement with hot, swappable drives.

70
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:23,838
Speaker 0: So it's just a SAN.

71
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:24,901
Speaker 1: Yes, but...

72
00:03:25,042 --> 00:03:26,525
Speaker 0: That probably doesn't even have iSCSI.

73
00:03:27,227 --> 00:03:30,358
Speaker 1: I think it can record more than one thing at a time, maybe.

74
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:30,899
Speaker 1: Better for $5,000.

75
00:03:30,899 --> 00:03:34,754
Speaker 0: Anything could record more than one thing at a time.

76
00:03:34,775 --> 00:03:36,323
Speaker 1: It better have at least two tuners.

77
00:03:36,443 --> 00:03:38,431
Speaker 1: It better have at least two tuners, at least.

78
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,859
Speaker 1: But anyway, um, yeah.

79
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,622
Speaker 1: Oh, it says six tuners.

80
00:03:45,624 --> 00:03:49,050
Speaker 0: Who would ever need this for anything?

81
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:53,038
Speaker 1: So on the one hand, no one needs this for anything.

82
00:03:56,686 --> 00:03:59,293
Speaker 1: On the other hand, no one needs this for anything.

83
00:04:00,376 --> 00:04:01,018
Speaker 1: Seriously?

84
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:05,231
Speaker 1: You're gonna back up all of television for like the next day?

85
00:04:05,793 --> 00:04:08,663
Speaker 0: Yeah, you watch one channel anyway, maybe two.

86
00:04:09,205 --> 00:04:17,154
Speaker 1: If anyone who has this who's actually using all six tuners at once, right, prove to me that there's six things worth recording and keeping forever.

87
00:04:17,555 --> 00:04:21,690
Speaker 1: If you're watching something and deleting it, you don't need this.

88
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:30,908
Speaker 1: You only need this if you have a legitimate reason to not only record six things at once, but to record so many things and to need to keep them around for all time.

89
00:04:30,928 --> 00:04:37,853
Speaker 0: According to the article, if you keep high quality HD, I don't know if this is based on them speculating or based on the specs.

90
00:04:38,054 --> 00:04:38,314
Speaker 1: 1080p.

91
00:04:38,314 --> 00:04:40,581
Speaker 0: 4,000 hours total.

92
00:04:41,704 --> 00:04:43,630
Speaker 0: That's not even that much content.

93
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:45,636
Speaker 1: Well, it's 10 a piece.

94
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:46,278
Speaker 0: Yeah.

95
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:52,747
Speaker 1: Most TV shows actually, even if you buy, let's say you buy the best cable package you can get, but the best dish package you can get.

96
00:04:52,808 --> 00:04:53,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do.

97
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,645
Speaker 1: It's called the internet and you have a four and you have a four K TV.

98
00:04:56,665 --> 00:04:57,308
Speaker 0: All right.

99
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:59,336
Speaker 1: Almost nothing is in four K if nothing.

100
00:04:59,938 --> 00:05:09,222
Speaker 1: And even tons of stuff is not even in 10 80 B. Lots of stuff is just 10 80 I or seven 20 peak because they don't want to use the bandwidth on the cable network for that or the satellite network.

101
00:05:09,382 --> 00:05:13,197
Speaker 0: Also, the people who still watch broadcast TV largely can't tell.

102
00:05:13,217 --> 00:05:16,950
Speaker 1: I wonder, here's the thing that's not mentioned, right?

103
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:28,968
Speaker 1: You're recording in HD, mostly video, but if TV shows are actually often in surround sound, if I record a TV show with this, no, you're not sounding so good there.

104
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:34,725
Speaker 1: Now is it, um, will it record, you know, 5.1 surround sound and play it back properly?

105
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:41,254
Speaker 0: That would actually be, all right, wait, I'm looking at the actual specs here because you seem to have just looked at the news.

106
00:05:41,294 --> 00:05:45,090
Speaker 0: without 24 terabyte raid five, which already raid five.

107
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:54,824
Speaker 0: Really like raid technology is kind of, uh, I don't want to say obsolete, but there, there's better ways to do redundancy than raid in the modern era.

108
00:05:54,844 --> 00:05:56,632
Speaker 1: Well, they've already said, right?

109
00:05:56,792 --> 00:05:57,716
Speaker 0: Also raid five.

110
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:01,550
Speaker 0: If any one of those tendis dies, it is a race against the clock.

111
00:06:01,931 --> 00:06:05,794
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm sure it'll light up and you can take it out because there's, you know, on the front panel.

112
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:06,135
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

113
00:06:06,155 --> 00:06:06,899
Speaker 0: It does a little bit more.

114
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,027
Speaker 0: So streaming live and recorded stuff so we can stream live stuff as you're watching it to smartphones and tablets.

115
00:06:13,388 --> 00:06:17,907
Speaker 1: So it's also a sling box with built in stream transcoding also whistling box, multi-room.

116
00:06:17,927 --> 00:06:19,152
Speaker 0: I don't know what that means.

117
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:22,950
Speaker 1: That means that, so normally a TiVo will have like one video out, right?

118
00:06:23,111 --> 00:06:24,559
Speaker 1: So it's plugged into one TV.

119
00:06:24,619 --> 00:06:26,309
Speaker 1: That's the TV you can watch recorded things on.

120
00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:38,039
Speaker 1: So if you go upstairs to your bedroom, cause you have a house, not in a Newark apartment, you couldn't watch something from the TiVo upstairs because the TiVo is downstairs where this TiVo will stream to the other TV in the house.

121
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:44,278
Speaker 0: Universal search across the local stuff, cable listings, video on demand, Netflix.

122
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,864
Speaker 1: That's something that TiVo just does.

123
00:06:46,085 --> 00:06:47,290
Speaker 0: Wait a minute and YouTube.

124
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,978
Speaker 0: Will it also record YouTube?

125
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:50,646
Speaker 1: I don't know if it'll record YouTube.

126
00:06:50,686 --> 00:06:51,410
Speaker 1: That would be interesting.

127
00:06:51,550 --> 00:07:01,020
Speaker 1: That would be, that would be interesting because one thing people don't know about TiVo is you have a TiVo, you can actually get the files off the TiVo pretty easily to use them, you know, for stuff on your computer.

128
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,904
Speaker 0: It's not what you watch.

129
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:05,300
Speaker 0: It does the same thing that I guess TiVo did or still does.

130
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,988
Speaker 0: It tells you what you should watch.

131
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:12,554
Speaker 1: But that's the, that's the thing that TiVo just does is if you have TiVo, you use that as your user interface for the whole TV.

132
00:07:12,634 --> 00:07:14,642
Speaker 0: Use your smartphone or tablet as the remote control.

133
00:07:14,822 --> 00:07:15,083
Speaker 0: Yep.

134
00:07:15,866 --> 00:07:16,408
Speaker 0: All right.

135
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:18,435
Speaker 1: Something I can already do with just any cable.

136
00:07:18,877 --> 00:07:25,784
Speaker 0: Slide Pro remote comes with it, including a full QWERTY keyboard to make fast text entry, RF, whatever.

137
00:07:25,804 --> 00:07:27,010
Speaker 1: That's the TiVo remote control.

138
00:07:27,251 --> 00:07:27,812
Speaker 0: Ethernet.

139
00:07:28,856 --> 00:07:30,160
Speaker 1: That's the stream tour out the house.

140
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,360
Speaker 1: Yeah.

141
00:07:30,481 --> 00:07:30,762
Speaker 0: Yep.

142
00:07:30,822 --> 00:07:31,564
Speaker 0: Blah, blah, blah.

143
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,832
Speaker 1: The YouTube and such also.

144
00:07:33,852 --> 00:07:36,201
Speaker 0: There's really no other specs here.

145
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:38,772
Speaker 1: It's just a TiVo with a lot of space that's maxed out.

146
00:07:38,872 --> 00:07:42,285
Speaker 0: I just, I can't imagine the person this is aimed at.

147
00:07:42,305 --> 00:07:43,068
Speaker 0: The kind of person.

148
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,535
Speaker 1: I'm not even paying for cable.

149
00:07:44,575 --> 00:07:46,424
Speaker 1: Do I really need to pay for a six X cable?

150
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:52,661
Speaker 0: The kind of person who this is aimed at is the kind of person who wouldn't be capable of using it.

151
00:07:52,701 --> 00:07:57,193
Speaker 1: It's watch TV.

152
00:07:57,414 --> 00:07:57,514
Speaker 1: But

153
00:07:57,574 --> 00:08:02,614
Speaker 0: even then, that kind of person is better served by pirate bay and a net like by a fucking, you could

154
00:08:02,694 --> 00:08:11,961
Speaker 1: almost justify using this at say some sort of media network where or like a news network where they're like, you know, getting clips from other, like if you work through the daily show, for example, right?

155
00:08:12,143 --> 00:08:12,384
Speaker 1: Yeah.

156
00:08:12,404 --> 00:08:16,905
Speaker 1: You could use this to record the daily show and the archive all your episodes forever, but yeah.

157
00:08:16,926 --> 00:08:22,789
Speaker 1: Or you could record all the news programs, all six 24 hour news and then use the embedded built in search.

158
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:28,417
Speaker 1: I see where you're going with this, but if you are a pro like that, you're not using some consumer friendly as TiVo.

159
00:08:28,457 --> 00:08:32,092
Speaker 1: You got that shit handled by the tech guys because you're a fucking TV network.

160
00:08:32,113 --> 00:08:33,155
Speaker 1: You don't need this.

161
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:43,610
Speaker 0: Well, and I mean the, the more hours of television someone watches from broadcast, I imagine the less understanding of like having a homeland.

162
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:50,413
Speaker 1: they are really rich person who'd never home and gets home once a year and watches all the TV at once.

163
00:08:50,694 --> 00:08:59,484
Speaker 0: If I were an overseas pirate who's providing illegal television to other people, this would be, this would be the best fucking thing in the world.

164
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:00,508
Speaker 0: Huh?

165
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:02,218
Speaker 1: Maybe that's not a good money deal.

166
00:09:02,258 --> 00:09:04,913
Speaker 1: If you're smart enough for that, you can just build a computer to do that much better.

167
00:09:04,933 --> 00:09:14,278
Speaker 0: And if you're the kind of person who's hobby is illegally redistributing American television broadcasts, I imagine you built your own crazy box with all the hard drives that people threw away.

168
00:09:14,319 --> 00:09:21,111
Speaker 1: But one thing to point out though, if you build your own crazy box, it's probably a lot harder to get six TV tuners than it is to just buy this.

169
00:09:21,752 --> 00:09:25,362
Speaker 1: TV tuners, good ones that just work like these ones.

170
00:09:26,606 --> 00:09:27,328
Speaker 0: They exist.

171
00:09:27,428 --> 00:09:28,571
Speaker 1: Yeah, but not easy.

172
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:29,614
Speaker 1: They're a little finicky.

173
00:09:29,935 --> 00:09:31,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, but even then $5,000 that's a lot of money.

174
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,451
Speaker 0: $5,000.

175
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:43,051
Speaker 0: with $5,000 I could buy like three fully loaded out like Drobo five ends for less than $5,000 a year.

176
00:09:43,151 --> 00:09:50,016
Speaker 0: I could buy the maximum cable satellite package, but then you wouldn't have everything you'd ever seen on it forever.

177
00:09:50,037 --> 00:09:51,121
Speaker 1: I don't need that.

178
00:09:51,483 --> 00:09:53,632
Speaker 0: Or for, you know, 4,000 hours worth of content.

179
00:09:53,652 --> 00:09:55,518
Speaker 1: If I'm paying that much, I'm watching that shit live.

180
00:09:55,778 --> 00:09:55,939
Speaker 0: Yeah.

181
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:57,745
Speaker 0: Huh?

182
00:09:58,748 --> 00:09:59,450
Speaker 0: It's interesting.

183
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:04,563
Speaker 0: Really curious who decided this was a good idea.

184
00:10:04,684 --> 00:10:11,595
Speaker 1: Who at TiVo came up with this thought it was a good idea, you know, actually went through with it and developed it and now decided to go ahead and sell it.

185
00:10:11,977 --> 00:10:12,158
Speaker 0: Yep.

186
00:10:12,218 --> 00:10:16,054
Speaker 0: I mean, they even make it big deal about how user swappable drives already trouble.

187
00:10:16,696 --> 00:10:16,856
Speaker 1: Yep.

188
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:26,131
Speaker 0: So in other, uh, interesting news, so people using drones for a lot of awesome stuff, pretty much only used for awesome stuff except for killing people.

189
00:10:26,854 --> 00:10:28,559
Speaker 0: Well, it depends with some people just need killing.

190
00:10:29,824 --> 00:10:30,044
Speaker 1: Yeah.

191
00:10:30,406 --> 00:10:31,288
Speaker 0: No, it happens.

192
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:33,254
Speaker 0: We did a show on kill bots.

193
00:10:33,635 --> 00:10:33,796
Speaker 0: Yeah.

194
00:10:34,257 --> 00:10:38,168
Speaker 0: So the FAA has done something interesting.

195
00:10:38,188 --> 00:10:56,877
Speaker 0: They've escalated the war because it's basically technically illegal to use drones for pretty much any commercial purpose, but tons of people are using them because they're so easy to use to like look for wells or like keep track of your cattle or just like all the stuff that you might want to use a drone for.

196
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:57,841
Speaker 0: Like people just doing this.

197
00:10:58,544 --> 00:11:06,113
Speaker 0: The FAA has been going around the internet looking for anyone who's using drones for any useful purpose and sending them cnds.

198
00:11:06,756 --> 00:11:07,138
Speaker 1: Okay.

199
00:11:07,178 --> 00:11:09,508
Speaker 1: Like if you post a youtube video of using a drone for something.

200
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:09,789
Speaker 1: Yes.

201
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,575
Speaker 0: They're literally a quote.

202
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:20,124
Speaker 0: Those who use UAS only for recreational enjoyment, operate in accordance with advisory circular 91 dash 57 cetera.

203
00:11:20,425 --> 00:11:21,409
Speaker 0: Generally applies to remote.

204
00:11:21,449 --> 00:11:21,510
Speaker 0: Wow.

205
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,835
Speaker 0: That's a really long paragraph.

206
00:11:22,855 --> 00:11:35,361
Speaker 0: I'm not going to read, but basically they are trying to prevent people from using them for such example topics as tornado research, inspecting gas well stacks or aerial photography, journalism, education.

207
00:11:36,144 --> 00:11:39,615
Speaker 1: I guess they want you to pay them now to get an FAA license.

208
00:11:40,598 --> 00:11:47,422
Speaker 0: No, you can't really get licenses in most situations because there's no precedent for using drones for these sorts of things.

209
00:11:48,125 --> 00:12:07,889
Speaker 0: Basically what's happened here is that the technology around drones like autonomous or like far remote drones has so rapidly eclipsed our ability to regulate it, but simultaneously our regulatory bodies are just competent enough to be able to trivially find all the people who are using this.

210
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:10,660
Speaker 1: It's not the regulator that is competent enough.

211
00:12:10,821 --> 00:12:17,891
Speaker 1: It's the bureaucrat who's enforcing the existing regulations and the regulators are basically not making any new regulations or changing them.

212
00:12:17,931 --> 00:12:25,220
Speaker 0: So I want to know what intern at FAA at the FAA ruined everything by telling their superior that you could just Google for this stuff.

213
00:12:25,301 --> 00:12:27,634
Speaker 0: I have a feeling it was figured it out on their own feeling.

214
00:12:27,674 --> 00:12:36,049
Speaker 1: A superior said, you know, Hey, you know, any, whoever enforces, you know, the most thingies gets bonuses and is, you know, surprise, something like that.

215
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:42,814
Speaker 1: Like, Hey, bureaucrats who enforce regulations, whoever can report the most violations gets prize maybe.

216
00:12:43,516 --> 00:12:44,278
Speaker 0: And the prize.

217
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:53,112
Speaker 0: Well, so we'll see what happens because the real issue is simply that Congress, the United States Congress has literally zero capacity to deal with this issue.

218
00:12:53,212 --> 00:12:54,659
Speaker 1: And he kind of any small issue.

219
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:56,688
Speaker 0: Well, this issue, I don't think is small.

220
00:12:56,748 --> 00:13:01,648
Speaker 0: The problem is I think, and I'm going to make a really pessimistic and I think accurate prediction.

221
00:13:01,668 --> 00:13:07,689
Speaker 0: It will be more than 20 years before Congress deals with this issue effectively.

222
00:13:07,729 --> 00:13:09,879
Speaker 1: You know, in other countries, this is not a problem.

223
00:13:10,342 --> 00:13:12,392
Speaker 0: Actually, this is a problem in a lot of other countries.

224
00:13:12,412 --> 00:13:13,879
Speaker 1: I didn't say every other country.

225
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,146
Speaker 0: I say there are three.

226
00:13:15,186 --> 00:13:17,815
Speaker 0: This is, well, I can name one Somalia.

227
00:13:18,296 --> 00:13:18,617
Speaker 1: Sure.

228
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:26,886
Speaker 1: I've seen plenty of like TV shows from other countries and not just Korea, but that is one of them because that is the one I watch the most TV shows from.

229
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:29,441
Speaker 1: They're just using drones to film shit all the fucking time.

230
00:13:29,462 --> 00:13:36,999
Speaker 0: So here's the question, because the same thing's happening in the U S major TV, the same thing's happening in the U S. So the question is, is it in these countries illegal?

231
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,694
Speaker 0: And how are the regulators just not even at the level of responding?

232
00:13:42,177 --> 00:13:43,342
Speaker 0: Are they just ignoring old law?

233
00:13:43,362 --> 00:13:46,718
Speaker 0: Like the problem is that the laws just don't have any way to deal with this stuff.

234
00:13:46,979 --> 00:13:50,193
Speaker 1: If there's no law about something, at least in the U S that means it's legal.

235
00:13:51,117 --> 00:13:54,310
Speaker 0: So here's an interesting example of how that's really starting to backfire.

236
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:57,261
Speaker 0: Someone made a really cool drone thing where say you're skiing, right?

237
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:05,532
Speaker 0: The drone will follow you circling at a predefined distance and following a pattern and just get awesome video of you skiing.

238
00:14:05,853 --> 00:14:06,094
Speaker 0: Cool.

239
00:14:06,214 --> 00:14:06,957
Speaker 0: Totally awesome.

240
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,172
Speaker 0: Uh, that is banned at ski resorts and there's some laws around it.

241
00:14:11,273 --> 00:14:11,594
Speaker 0: Sure.

242
00:14:11,654 --> 00:14:20,485
Speaker 0: However, there is a way there is a loophole to get around the law that is far more dangerous than breaking the law, which is attached the drone to a tether.

243
00:14:21,909 --> 00:14:30,279
Speaker 0: If you do that, you now have a rotating neck catcher, but simultaneously you're not breaking that law anymore, but it will strangle you to death.

244
00:14:30,721 --> 00:14:33,873
Speaker 0: Well, it'll probably strangle someone else or maybe get caught on it.

245
00:14:33,894 --> 00:14:37,831
Speaker 1: If it goes around you 360 degrees all at once, then it will tie you up.

246
00:14:38,132 --> 00:14:38,794
Speaker 0: Well, they could.

247
00:14:39,316 --> 00:14:41,866
Speaker 0: Scott, I can imagine tethers where that is not.

248
00:14:41,906 --> 00:14:45,065
Speaker 1: what would happen to like a screw on the top of your helmet and it just stays above you.

249
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:47,395
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think the problem will be if you run into anything.

250
00:14:49,582 --> 00:14:50,786
Speaker 0: So I don't know what to do about this.

251
00:14:50,926 --> 00:14:55,279
Speaker 0: It's a, the problem is that these tech issues are no longer tech issues.

252
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:04,182
Speaker 0: There are solely bureaucracy issues and we will likely not see in our youth any action taken by any major world government.

253
00:15:04,202 --> 00:15:10,650
Speaker 0: I don't know what to do about this, but the problems are amazing and the technology is moving so quickly.

254
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,738
Speaker 0: Look at how, look at one funeral at a time.

255
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:13,362
Speaker 1: The next.

256
00:15:13,502 --> 00:15:20,057
Speaker 0: Yeah, but look at in the last five years, how rapidly drones went from toys to extremely commercially useful.

257
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:41,240
Speaker 0: So things of the day, uh, I found this, it's an anime music video called night of the hunter and it is set to the Kirby anime and it seems to follow a meta night.

258
00:15:41,681 --> 00:15:42,283
Speaker 0: The character.

259
00:15:42,303 --> 00:15:44,289
Speaker 0: I make this my thing of the day.

260
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,856
Speaker 0: One, because it has as of now 318 views and 14 likes.

261
00:15:46,877 --> 00:15:48,321
Speaker 0: So the internet has not seen this.

262
00:15:48,481 --> 00:16:03,761
Speaker 0: and two, it is proof of a, of a new internet theory and anime music video to a thing can guaranteedly make that thing seem a thousand times more awesome than it is.

263
00:16:03,781 --> 00:16:06,430
Speaker 1: I think I've seen this before.

264
00:16:07,751 --> 00:16:08,212
Speaker 1: Yeah.

265
00:16:08,413 --> 00:16:13,330
Speaker 1: This, this AMV, not the, not the same view specifically, but like that shot of meta night.

266
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,198
Speaker 1: I feel like I've seen that somewhere.

267
00:16:15,218 --> 00:16:15,278
Speaker 1: Huh?

268
00:16:16,082 --> 00:16:22,564
Speaker 0: You know where you might've seen it is in that Evangelion opener to, uh, set to the animation from Kirby, the animation.

269
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:23,366
Speaker 1: Maybe.

270
00:16:23,687 --> 00:16:35,279
Speaker 1: Anyway, so Calcio Fiorentino also known as Calcio Storico historic football is an early form of football that originated in 16th century Italy.

271
00:16:35,499 --> 00:16:36,664
Speaker 1: Once widely played.

272
00:16:36,684 --> 00:16:41,118
Speaker 1: The sport is thought to originated in the Piazza Santa Croce in Florence.

273
00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:45,350
Speaker 1: Here it became known as the G go Dell Italian word.

274
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:53,494
Speaker 1: This is excellent or simply Calcio, which is now also the name for football in the Italian language.

275
00:16:53,514 --> 00:17:01,831
Speaker 1: Uh, so basically there's four sections of Italy, the blues, the reds, the whites and the greens.

276
00:17:01,851 --> 00:17:03,296
Speaker 1: Oh, Florence, right?

277
00:17:03,396 --> 00:17:07,170
Speaker 1: Each quarter of Florence, uh, is represented by a team.

278
00:17:07,891 --> 00:17:13,702
Speaker 1: And once a year on June 24th, they play this game.

279
00:17:13,722 --> 00:17:17,670
Speaker 1: Uh, it's pretty much football that doesn't stop.

280
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:22,550
Speaker 1: You can do whatever you want to get the ball and the net touchdown at the other end to get a point.

281
00:17:23,852 --> 00:17:27,510
Speaker 1: And you have a zillion dudes and also some historic pomp and circumstance.

282
00:17:28,451 --> 00:17:31,728
Speaker 0: Scott showed this to me and before it was explained what was going on.

283
00:17:31,788 --> 00:17:32,892
Speaker 0: Here's how I would describe it.

284
00:17:32,972 --> 00:17:40,299
Speaker 0: Not knowing there is a huge line of boxers facing off, beating the ever living fuck out of each other.

285
00:17:40,379 --> 00:17:40,942
Speaker 1: Okay, so here we go.

286
00:17:40,962 --> 00:17:43,293
Speaker 1: I'm going to read the rules from Wikipedia because why not?

287
00:17:44,055 --> 00:17:50,157
Speaker 1: Matches last 50 minutes and are played 50 5 0. played in a field covered in sand twice as long as it is wide.

288
00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:51,884
Speaker 1: A white line divides it in half.

289
00:17:51,924 --> 00:17:53,129
Speaker 1: A goal runs the width of each end.

290
00:17:53,571 --> 00:17:57,062
Speaker 1: Each team has 27 players with no substitutions.

291
00:17:57,523 --> 00:18:04,481
Speaker 1: The teams are made of four goalkeepers, three fullbacks, five halfbacks and 15 forwards.

292
00:18:05,705 --> 00:18:08,595
Speaker 1: Captain and standard bears tent sits at the center of the goal net.

293
00:18:08,756 --> 00:18:11,349
Speaker 1: They do not actively participate, but can organize their teams.

294
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:16,891
Speaker 1: They act sometimes act as reps and mainly to calm down the players or to stop fights, stop fights.

295
00:18:17,494 --> 00:18:20,565
Speaker 1: Uh, there's a ref and he has six lines.

296
00:18:20,585 --> 00:18:24,263
Speaker 0: The only things you're not allowed to do are sucker punches and kicks to the head.

297
00:18:24,444 --> 00:18:24,725
Speaker 0: Yes.

298
00:18:24,806 --> 00:18:27,419
Speaker 0: Head butting, punching, elbowing and choking are totally okay.

299
00:18:27,761 --> 00:18:28,867
Speaker 1: Every anything else is okay.

300
00:18:28,887 --> 00:18:33,041
Speaker 0: So it's, oh, more than one person can't attack another person at the same time.

301
00:18:33,162 --> 00:18:33,362
Speaker 1: Yep.

302
00:18:34,104 --> 00:18:34,265
Speaker 1: Yep.

303
00:18:34,626 --> 00:18:39,082
Speaker 1: So, uh, players try by any means necessary to get the ball into the opponent's goal.

304
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:41,734
Speaker 0: Guys, any means necessary.

305
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:47,657
Speaker 1: I mean, it is important to shoot with precision because every time a player misses, the opposing team gets half a point.

306
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:52,958
Speaker 1: So basically no one goes for like the long throw that they lands in the score area.

307
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:57,800
Speaker 1: They fight until there's an opening and then run over and put it in very carefully or relatively carefully.

308
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:10,196
Speaker 0: Like at one point there was just this line of people and they have their fists up like old, uh, and then one guy he's looking at the other guy looking at each other in the eye.

309
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:13,654
Speaker 0: They got their fists up and then he just hauls back and kicks him in the nuts.

310
00:19:14,096 --> 00:19:27,482
Speaker 1: I do really like this rule though of, you know, the, if you take a shot and the other team gets half a point, I feel like that mechanic could be used in other, not ridiculously violent games, soccer, even board games,

311
00:19:27,522 --> 00:19:27,944
Speaker 0: soccer,

312
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:33,183
Speaker 1: even less shots and even more boring in games where, you know, shots are too much.

313
00:19:33,303 --> 00:19:34,950
Speaker 1: It could help basketball a lot, right?

314
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,015
Speaker 1: You wouldn't take a shot.

315
00:19:36,055 --> 00:19:38,206
Speaker 0: Well, that would just mean no one would ever go for it.

316
00:19:38,226 --> 00:19:39,351
Speaker 0: It would only dunk.

317
00:19:39,532 --> 00:19:39,793
Speaker 1: Yeah.

318
00:19:39,813 --> 00:19:54,132
Speaker 1: I mean, there are ways you could use this, you know, kind of rule, maybe in conjunction with other modifications to improve a lot of games or sports to basically when people are just shooting like crazy or just trying to score like crazy because there's no reason not to, right?

319
00:19:54,413 --> 00:20:02,446
Speaker 1: You can force people to be much more careful, uh, in their attack strategies by basically awarding points to the other team for failed offense.

320
00:20:02,506 --> 00:20:08,509
Speaker 1: Like what if in football, if you didn't get a field goal or a touchdown on your drive, the other team got a point.

321
00:20:10,652 --> 00:20:17,036
Speaker 1: If they, if the defense gets a stop that you score points, so suddenly defense becomes way more important, right?

322
00:20:17,437 --> 00:20:18,441
Speaker 0: This is amazing.

323
00:20:18,641 --> 00:20:26,625
Speaker 0: And at least at one point in my life before I die, I want to be in live attendance of this game and go to Florence on June 24th.

324
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:36,899
Speaker 0: And also, uh, these guys get points because the uniforms they wear are basically, it's like a cross between a modern sports outfit and pantaloons.

325
00:20:37,421 --> 00:20:39,367
Speaker 1: They somehow have not completely removed this.

326
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:43,679
Speaker 1: It's like this kind of reenactment aspect of the sport, which is great.

327
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,260
Speaker 0: Yeah.

328
00:20:44,902 --> 00:20:53,428
Speaker 0: Uh, I think this would be really popular if it were played in the United States, but it would also be illegal.

329
00:20:53,568 --> 00:20:58,825
Speaker 1: It's basically football earliest, most primitive form of football that I've seen ever.

330
00:20:59,327 --> 00:21:00,792
Speaker 0: It also illustrates something like it.

331
00:21:01,113 --> 00:21:10,461
Speaker 0: I love this video because it's so primal and so fucked up, but at the same time, uh, watch this and then watch modern American football.

332
00:21:10,923 --> 00:21:13,771
Speaker 0: And that is why there are rules in sports.

333
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:19,370
Speaker 1: That's why football has more rules than all the other sports in the meta moment.

334
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:22,741
Speaker 0: The book club book is a canticle for Liebowitz.

335
00:21:22,861 --> 00:21:24,366
Speaker 1: I've read two thirds of it.

336
00:21:24,848 --> 00:21:25,892
Speaker 0: Ah, did you get the spaceships?

337
00:21:26,253 --> 00:21:28,119
Speaker 1: I am on the first page of spaceships.

338
00:21:28,681 --> 00:21:33,136
Speaker 0: Oh, spaceships is by far the most depressing section of that book.

339
00:21:33,156 --> 00:21:35,766
Speaker 1: The second section was rather depressing.

340
00:21:36,147 --> 00:21:36,328
Speaker 0: Wow.

341
00:21:36,368 --> 00:21:37,933
Speaker 0: You thought the second section was depressing?

342
00:21:38,394 --> 00:21:38,856
Speaker 1: Slightly.

343
00:21:38,876 --> 00:21:39,478
Speaker 1: Wow.

344
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:42,166
Speaker 0: Why do you read the third section?

345
00:21:42,447 --> 00:21:44,052
Speaker 1: It was like silver lining depressing.

346
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:44,634
Speaker 0: Yeah.

347
00:21:45,056 --> 00:21:45,256
Speaker 0: Yeah.

348
00:21:45,517 --> 00:21:45,798
Speaker 0: Yeah.

349
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:49,771
Speaker 0: The first section might be the most depressing depending on how you look at it.

350
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:52,980
Speaker 0: We'll see.

351
00:21:53,241 --> 00:21:56,671
Speaker 0: We've got to save our commentary for after we both read it all the way through.

352
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:58,660
Speaker 0: I might have to read it again.

353
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,383
Speaker 0: It's been so long.

354
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:00,969
Speaker 0: I don't remember many details at all.

355
00:22:02,651 --> 00:22:02,872
Speaker 0: Yeah.

356
00:22:03,092 --> 00:22:04,236
Speaker 0: I wonder why it took so long.

357
00:22:04,898 --> 00:22:05,159
Speaker 1: Anyway.

358
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:05,862
Speaker 0: Anyway.

359
00:22:05,882 --> 00:22:11,220
Speaker 0: We have no major conventions coming up until PAX Australia, which is coming up in like two months.

360
00:22:11,722 --> 00:22:12,364
Speaker 1: I'm not going.

361
00:22:12,585 --> 00:22:13,066
Speaker 0: I'm going.

362
00:22:13,548 --> 00:22:14,993
Speaker 0: So I will see you all there.

363
00:22:15,013 --> 00:22:16,398
Speaker 0: Happy.

364
00:22:17,282 --> 00:22:17,563
Speaker 1: Fricking.

365
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:19,570
Speaker 1: Why does the grocery store have like Halloween shit already?

366
00:22:20,311 --> 00:22:21,975
Speaker 0: Uh, I have not seen that.

367
00:22:22,156 --> 00:22:23,339
Speaker 1: I saw Halloween candy.

368
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:25,565
Speaker 1: I even saw Hanukkah shit.

369
00:22:26,147 --> 00:22:27,150
Speaker 0: Uh, I'm waiting to hear.

370
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,100
Speaker 1: Oh, I guess it was Rosh Hashanah shit, but yeah.

371
00:22:29,161 --> 00:22:29,683
Speaker 0: I'm waiting.

372
00:22:29,764 --> 00:22:30,709
Speaker 1: That's actually appropriate.

373
00:22:30,729 --> 00:22:31,954
Speaker 1: That's like the first Christmas song.

374
00:22:31,994 --> 00:22:37,597
Speaker 0: You will know because I will tweet a lot of obscenity the moment I hear a Christmas song.

375
00:22:37,637 --> 00:22:38,219
Speaker 1: Five weeks.

376
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,766
Speaker 0: And any retail establishment.

377
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:42,034
Speaker 1: It's gonna be, it was before Halloween last year.

378
00:22:42,175 --> 00:22:44,824
Speaker 1: So give it five weeks, five to six weeks.

379
00:22:45,506 --> 00:22:48,115
Speaker 0: I suppose I could avoid going into stores, thus avoiding this.

380
00:22:48,335 --> 00:22:49,680
Speaker 1: I can't avoid going to work.

381
00:22:50,683 --> 00:22:51,044
Speaker 0: Why?

382
00:22:51,626 --> 00:22:52,750
Speaker 0: Why would you hear it at work?

383
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,894
Speaker 1: I'm at work at 49th and 7th.

384
00:22:55,777 --> 00:22:59,345
Speaker 1: It might as well be fucking Santa's workshop.

385
00:23:00,167 --> 00:23:01,831
Speaker 0: You might as well, you know, earplugs.

386
00:23:02,934 --> 00:23:03,976
Speaker 1: Eye plugs.

387
00:23:06,582 --> 00:23:07,444
Speaker 0: Practice being blind.

388
00:23:07,484 --> 00:23:11,333
Speaker 0: Try to walk from the subway to your door without opening your eyes.

389
00:23:11,755 --> 00:23:17,114
Speaker 1: They're replacing the, uh, you know, the billboards on my office building with digital signage.

390
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:18,419
Speaker 0: That won't be annoying.

391
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,186
Speaker 1: I'm glad it faces away from the building.

392
00:23:20,206 --> 00:23:24,319
Speaker 1: So, and we don't, none of our windows are near it, but still it's there.

393
00:23:25,503 --> 00:23:25,844
Speaker 0: So yeah.

394
00:23:26,265 --> 00:23:33,862
Speaker 0: Uh, the other day we, uh, you know, we're back from PAX and we recorded panels and a bunch of other content in glorious 4k.

395
00:23:33,923 --> 00:23:38,614
Speaker 0: We're not uploading that shit in 4k.

396
00:23:39,256 --> 00:23:41,001
Speaker 0: So, uh, that's awesome at all.

397
00:23:41,523 --> 00:23:42,847
Speaker 0: Went to edit that shit.

398
00:23:43,348 --> 00:23:51,332
Speaker 0: And the first thing I realized was that, uh, I built my computer, the one I'm using right now for geek nights in 2009.

399
00:23:51,332 --> 00:23:52,617
Speaker 1: Oh, well five years.

400
00:23:52,858 --> 00:23:53,581
Speaker 1: Time to upgrade.

401
00:23:53,822 --> 00:23:54,043
Speaker 1: Yeah.

402
00:23:54,244 --> 00:23:55,107
Speaker 0: I have not upgraded yet.

403
00:23:55,127 --> 00:23:55,710
Speaker 1: Or buy a new one.

404
00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:09,261
Speaker 0: And in fact, the only thing I've had to upgrade in the entire span of this computer was I bought a $0 now and I bought a better video card at one point.

405
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:09,823
Speaker 0: That's it.

406
00:24:10,966 --> 00:24:12,590
Speaker 0: Now I have to upgrade again.

407
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:16,682
Speaker 0: I just ordered a couple of, uh, 256 gigabyte SSDs.

408
00:24:17,003 --> 00:24:19,050
Speaker 1: That's not really, it's kind of an upgrade.

409
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:29,960
Speaker 0: Well, it's an upgrade because when I first bought this computer, I put windows on a 32 gigabyte SSD that I paid like $300 for because it was 2009 when I did that.

410
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:30,561
Speaker 0: And that was awesome.

411
00:24:35,191 --> 00:24:43,176
Speaker 0: Later I moved windows from that 32 gigabyte SSD to a spinning disk because windows outgrew it and there's no way to fix that.

412
00:24:43,196 --> 00:24:43,677
Speaker 1: Nope.

413
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:54,457
Speaker 0: So that slowed the computer down to a degree, at least until it booted up because between 12 gigs of RAM and ready boost, pretty much it took forever to boot, but once it was booted, it was fine.

414
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:06,330
Speaker 0: But one panel recorded in 4k, plus the 1080p backup video from an alternate angle and the audio is like 80 gigabytes.

415
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,458
Speaker 0: I can't put the whole thing on an SSD.

416
00:25:09,819 --> 00:25:22,250
Speaker 0: In fact, I interleaved the segments across two spinning disks and the SSD, but the moral is I can't really edit 4k video unless it's on an SSD.

417
00:25:23,611 --> 00:25:28,366
Speaker 0: So I bought a couple of cheapo 256 gigabyte SSDs to add to this computer.

418
00:25:28,386 --> 00:25:30,974
Speaker 0: I think I can get another two years out of it.

419
00:25:31,516 --> 00:25:31,857
Speaker 0: Easily.

420
00:25:32,439 --> 00:25:34,004
Speaker 1: Computers are lasting longer than they ever did.

421
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:40,171
Speaker 1: Mine, I don't know when I bought it, but it's lasting way long and needs no upgrades, but that's because I went all the fuck out.

422
00:25:40,292 --> 00:25:40,733
Speaker 0: I did too.

423
00:25:40,793 --> 00:25:41,817
Speaker 0: I spent like $3,800 on this computer.

424
00:25:41,837 --> 00:25:49,446
Speaker 1: I have a GTX 680, 32 gigs of RAM, i7 ridiculousness, and it hasn't needed any upgrading ever.

425
00:25:49,566 --> 00:25:49,807
Speaker 0: Yep.

426
00:25:49,888 --> 00:25:51,635
Speaker 0: I mean, I got a, I got an i7.

427
00:25:51,655 --> 00:25:52,559
Speaker 1: I got this one.

428
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:53,523
Speaker 1: The 680 was new.

429
00:25:53,603 --> 00:25:55,150
Speaker 1: So that's figured out when that was.

430
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,177
Speaker 0: I don't even have USB three.

431
00:25:57,198 --> 00:25:58,262
Speaker 1: I have USB three.

432
00:25:58,362 --> 00:25:58,764
Speaker 0: Yeah.

433
00:25:58,864 --> 00:26:00,170
Speaker 0: Your computer is way newer than mine.

434
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:09,708
Speaker 1: So the, you know, the best thing about upgrading is something like a hard drive, which is not really a tech sort of an upgrade, whatever is keeping the old stuff.

435
00:26:09,949 --> 00:26:11,797
Speaker 1: It's like, you upgrade your video card, your old video card.

436
00:26:11,817 --> 00:26:12,159
Speaker 1: Goodbye.

437
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:13,062
Speaker 1: You know, my 800, my 8,800 GT is gone.

438
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:15,632
Speaker 1: Someone else has it.

439
00:26:15,672 --> 00:26:15,893
Speaker 0: Yep.

440
00:26:16,434 --> 00:26:25,259
Speaker 1: But, uh, you know, when I had the old previous computer, I had a 128 gig SSD in that, in that computer.

441
00:26:25,701 --> 00:26:27,027
Speaker 1: I didn't buy it when I made that computer.

442
00:26:27,047 --> 00:26:32,159
Speaker 1: I bought it later when I got the new computer, but a 256 gig SSD.

443
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,283
Speaker 1: And now I got two SSDs.

444
00:26:34,825 --> 00:26:41,686
Speaker 1: Oh, and the 128 one is like, you know, my Adobe premiere Photoshop swap discy thing.

445
00:26:41,807 --> 00:26:51,824
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is, you know, if I tried it, it's hard because the advice I would give on how upgrading computers works is different every five years because technology has actually changed.

446
00:26:51,845 --> 00:26:54,533
Speaker 0: Like consumer PC technology has changed a lot.

447
00:26:55,676 --> 00:26:55,897
Speaker 1: Yeah.

448
00:26:55,937 --> 00:26:57,240
Speaker 1: Since like the nineties.

449
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:11,716
Speaker 0: But at the same time, the trend has been with a few exceptions up, you can upgrade computers pretty semi indefinitely at this point because CPU is pretty much never the bottleneck anymore.

450
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:14,042
Speaker 1: Well, it's sometimes isn't a better CPU to get.

451
00:27:14,062 --> 00:27:20,489
Speaker 0: Well, like, well, I'll put it this way for what most of you listening use your computers for.

452
00:27:20,529 --> 00:27:26,957
Speaker 0: Like, especially like anyone who uses like playing games or whatever, the video card matters more than everything else in your computer.

453
00:27:27,138 --> 00:27:27,319
Speaker 0: Yep.

454
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:30,513
Speaker 1: And if you're not using a video card, nothing else in your.

455
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:32,000
Speaker 1: nothing in the computer is holding you back.

456
00:27:32,281 --> 00:27:39,410
Speaker 0: So, cause I, the reason I thought of this episode was I saw a friend who will remain nameless, who was saying that, Oh, GTA five is coming out.

457
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,196
Speaker 0: I guess I got to get a new PC.

458
00:27:41,256 --> 00:27:43,667
Speaker 0: My gaming PC doesn't really hold up anymore.

459
00:27:43,788 --> 00:27:44,591
Speaker 1: Just buy a new video card.

460
00:27:44,612 --> 00:27:45,697
Speaker 0: I was like, what video card do you have?

461
00:27:45,717 --> 00:27:46,319
Speaker 0: Just buy a new one.

462
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:48,650
Speaker 0: I don't upgrade computers.

463
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:49,914
Speaker 0: That's really hard.

464
00:27:50,015 --> 00:27:50,838
Speaker 0: Not worth the effort.

465
00:27:51,018 --> 00:27:57,505
Speaker 1: I'm anti intellectual and like spending a bunch of ridiculous, unnecessary money on things like dude, what you're going to buy?

466
00:27:57,526 --> 00:27:59,213
Speaker 0: a thousand dollar new one.

467
00:27:59,273 --> 00:28:00,517
Speaker 1: My car needs an oil change.

468
00:28:00,557 --> 00:28:01,681
Speaker 1: Better buy a new car.

469
00:28:02,203 --> 00:28:07,279
Speaker 0: If you buy like a thousand dollar new computer, the video card it comes with is probably shit.

470
00:28:07,761 --> 00:28:08,784
Speaker 1: That's also true.

471
00:28:09,085 --> 00:28:15,067
Speaker 0: If you buy a $400 video card, you can probably keep using the same computer for another two to four years.

472
00:28:15,409 --> 00:28:16,312
Speaker 1: That's also true.

473
00:28:16,994 --> 00:28:22,790
Speaker 0: I mean, the greatest thing is I run, I ran one time I rendered a video in software mode.

474
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:25,280
Speaker 0: I haven't turned off the video card acceleration just to see.

475
00:28:26,123 --> 00:28:32,103
Speaker 0: And I ran the windows performance profiler for the entire render just to see like what was being used.

476
00:28:32,685 --> 00:28:38,180
Speaker 0: And sure I could, in that case, I maxed out my CPU a hundred percent.

477
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:38,761
Speaker 1: Whoa.

478
00:28:39,162 --> 00:28:39,804
Speaker 1: All the cores.

479
00:28:40,045 --> 00:28:40,626
Speaker 1: All eight.

480
00:28:40,767 --> 00:28:41,448
Speaker 1: Whoa.

481
00:28:41,749 --> 00:28:48,804
Speaker 0: But at the same time, disk IO was at like 80%.

482
00:28:48,804 --> 00:28:51,009
Speaker 0: And Ram, I was using maybe half my Ram.

483
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:51,390
Speaker 1: Yep.

484
00:28:52,251 --> 00:28:57,967
Speaker 0: But then when I switched to a video card rendering, CPU is not maxed out.

485
00:28:58,248 --> 00:29:00,838
Speaker 0: Disk IO is literally the hundred percent bottleneck.

486
00:29:01,722 --> 00:29:06,416
Speaker 0: And if I render solely from an SSD, I can't actually tell.

487
00:29:06,477 --> 00:29:07,461
Speaker 0: Like it kind of jumps around.

488
00:29:07,481 --> 00:29:11,739
Speaker 0: Like at that point renders go so fast that it literally like is no longer concerned.

489
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:19,612
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, even a video render, an HD video rendering, which is something that takes, unless it happens instantly, like you click export and it says done.

490
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,159
Speaker 1: There's some bottleneck somewhere.

491
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:22,520
Speaker 1: Yep.

492
00:29:22,881 --> 00:29:23,142
Speaker 1: Right.

493
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:27,535
Speaker 1: But you're playing a video game and it's rendering one frame.

494
00:29:27,676 --> 00:29:30,444
Speaker 1: every time your monitor refreshes the end.

495
00:29:30,765 --> 00:29:30,986
Speaker 0: Yep.

496
00:29:32,089 --> 00:29:32,390
Speaker 1: You're done.

497
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:38,590
Speaker 0: So if you got a hundred frame monitor, you need to render a hundred frames at that resolution.

498
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:39,975
Speaker 1: No one has a hundred frame monitor.

499
00:29:39,995 --> 00:29:41,059
Speaker 1: You either have like a 60, a 75 or a 120.

500
00:29:41,059 --> 00:29:44,812
Speaker 1: Probably a 60 or 120.

501
00:29:44,812 --> 00:29:46,958
Speaker 0: Man, that's something that changed a lot.

502
00:29:46,978 --> 00:29:48,061
Speaker 0: Remember CRTs?

503
00:29:48,081 --> 00:29:51,852
Speaker 0: I ran my CRT at RIT at a hundred Hertz.

504
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:53,517
Speaker 0: Yeah.

505
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:53,999
Speaker 1: Yeah.

506
00:29:54,019 --> 00:29:55,484
Speaker 1: There were nineties and stuff like that too.

507
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:55,846
Speaker 1: Whatever.

508
00:29:55,986 --> 00:29:56,227
Speaker 0: Yep.

509
00:29:56,448 --> 00:30:01,623
Speaker 0: Well, if I ran it under about 75, like I ran it at 60, it would make kind of a noise.

510
00:30:01,643 --> 00:30:05,476
Speaker 1: So 60 by the way, 60 is enough for pretty much anything you're going to do.

511
00:30:05,496 --> 00:30:06,460
Speaker 0: Yep.

512
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:11,445
Speaker 1: 120 is if you have 3d because it's basically doing two sixties left eye, right eye, left eye, right eye, left eye, right eye.

513
00:30:11,445 --> 00:30:12,210
Speaker 0: 240 buys you nothing.

514
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:13,793
Speaker 0: Nothing.

515
00:30:13,813 --> 00:30:14,114
Speaker 0: Nothing.

516
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:14,696
Speaker 1: Waste.

517
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:23,040
Speaker 0: But seriously guys, if you're thinking, if your computer seems slow and it seems slow as a gamer, uh, just buy a video card.

518
00:30:23,902 --> 00:30:29,879
Speaker 0: I highly doubt your video card is already the second fastest video card on Mi Pro silence.

519
00:30:30,421 --> 00:30:32,649
Speaker 1: That's some other upgradey bullshit, right?

520
00:30:32,729 --> 00:30:36,640
Speaker 1: So more RAM, a lot of people like, man, I buy more RAM.

521
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:43,161
Speaker 1: Number one, it could be when you don't have enough RAM that you're just really bad at computer.

522
00:30:43,181 --> 00:30:45,409
Speaker 1: That's actually the most likely thing.

523
00:30:46,292 --> 00:30:50,230
Speaker 1: I have computers that don't have much RAM in them, like four gigs, which is not a lot these days.

524
00:30:50,951 --> 00:30:53,038
Speaker 1: And I had never used all that RAM ever.

525
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,101
Speaker 1: Why?

526
00:30:54,122 --> 00:30:59,102
Speaker 1: Because A on that computer, for example, my work computer, I'm not doing anything ridiculous.

527
00:30:59,122 --> 00:31:05,627
Speaker 1: I actually am doing some things like virtual machines, but even that doesn't push the limits of four gigs.

528
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,736
Speaker 0: Most of the people who complain like, ah, I need more RAM.

529
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,499
Speaker 0: I'm using on my RAM.

530
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,966
Speaker 1: Why does your Chrome have 10,000 tabs open?

531
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:14,361
Speaker 0: But even then, if you look, they're still not swapping.

532
00:31:14,381 --> 00:31:15,626
Speaker 0: That's true.

533
00:31:15,786 --> 00:31:17,676
Speaker 0: Like they mistake, like, yeah, like.

534
00:31:17,716 --> 00:31:18,702
Speaker 0: right now I'm looking at my computer.

535
00:31:18,722 --> 00:31:19,910
Speaker 0: I've got 12 gigs of RAM.

536
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,922
Speaker 0: I've turned swapping off because I literally do not need it.

537
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:23,605
Speaker 0: You know what?

538
00:31:24,087 --> 00:31:29,602
Speaker 0: I've got four gigs of cash, eight gigs available, four gigs free.

539
00:31:30,384 --> 00:31:30,645
Speaker 1: Right.

540
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:34,880
Speaker 1: It is very unlikely that you actually need more RAM or that it will do anything for you.

541
00:31:35,281 --> 00:31:39,139
Speaker 1: And even if you are filling up your RAM, it's probably just your shitty behavior.

542
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:42,975
Speaker 1: Or you let a bunch of shit ruin your computer and it's all running in the background.

543
00:31:43,337 --> 00:31:44,181
Speaker 1: Shit you don't need that.

544
00:31:44,201 --> 00:31:46,874
Speaker 1: you should uninstall or clear out or viruses or who knows what.

545
00:31:47,296 --> 00:31:48,561
Speaker 1: And you just fucked up your computer.

546
00:31:48,582 --> 00:31:49,868
Speaker 1: And that's why your RAM is full.

547
00:31:50,209 --> 00:31:59,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I've pretty much never seen anyone using all the RAM unless either a piddly amount of RAM or they think they're using all the RAM because they don't know what all those metrics mean.

548
00:31:59,692 --> 00:32:07,870
Speaker 1: If you are not swapping, which means your computer has literally used all of the RAM and is using hard drive as extra RAM because it has no choice.

549
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:11,244
Speaker 1: More RAM will do absolutely nothing for you whatsoever.

550
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:16,987
Speaker 0: Now, simultaneously, I've seen people suggest that you should have an SSD and put your swap on that.

551
00:32:17,048 --> 00:32:18,012
Speaker 0: No, just buy more RAM.

552
00:32:18,413 --> 00:32:19,558
Speaker 0: Yes, just buy more RAM.

553
00:32:19,598 --> 00:32:20,743
Speaker 0: That's cheaper than SSDs.

554
00:32:20,823 --> 00:32:25,039
Speaker 1: If your computer can't hold more RAM, then you should upgrade maybe your actual computer.

555
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:36,666
Speaker 1: But, you know, four gigs at work, just doing normal everyday stuff that, you know, and a virtual machine, which means more more so than people are just doing web browsing and shit is more than enough.

556
00:32:36,947 --> 00:32:40,502
Speaker 1: So if you've got eight or if you've got more than four, you don't need more.

557
00:32:41,004 --> 00:32:46,270
Speaker 0: So part of the reason I bought the computer I did, the motherboard I got actually was really expensive compared to other motherboards.

558
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,719
Speaker 0: You know what it's got going for it?

559
00:32:48,041 --> 00:32:55,329
Speaker 0: One, it's got like a fuck ton of sados, like way more than I could ever use, which seemed like I would use it back then.

560
00:32:55,369 --> 00:32:58,704
Speaker 0: And then I ended up not so much like I made some raids and I kind of didn't need them anymore.

561
00:32:59,468 --> 00:33:05,304
Speaker 0: But because hard drive technology just got so much better, but it had six dim slots.

562
00:33:06,366 --> 00:33:09,836
Speaker 0: So I've got, I just filled that thing up with two gigabyte sticks.

563
00:33:10,257 --> 00:33:10,438
Speaker 1: Yeah.

564
00:33:11,802 --> 00:33:12,123
Speaker 1: So

565
00:33:12,965 --> 00:33:26,152
Speaker 0: there used to be a time when you'd buy cards to upgrade your computer like, well, there used to be a time when you would buy like a chip to put over your four eighty six or over your three eighty six or like you'd put a math coprocessor in there.

566
00:33:27,115 --> 00:33:27,778
Speaker 1: Those were days.

567
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:30,810
Speaker 1: There were days where you just replace your CPU in the same motherboard.

568
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:31,311
Speaker 1: Yeah.

569
00:33:31,652 --> 00:33:32,495
Speaker 0: I remember those days.

570
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:38,173
Speaker 0: Remember we went from sockets to slot or slot sockets to slots to sockets again.

571
00:33:38,374 --> 00:33:41,004
Speaker 1: There were days when your motherboard only had S.A.T.

572
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:44,134
Speaker 1: at thirty three ribbon cable connectors.

573
00:33:44,215 --> 00:33:49,855
Speaker 1: You bought an eighty sixty six controller for your PCI slot connected drives to the computer I'm using.

574
00:33:49,916 --> 00:33:58,069
Speaker 0: now that I built in 2009 is the first computer I've ever built that didn't have at least one like legacy ISO or ISA slot hanging off on the back.

575
00:33:58,832 --> 00:34:00,178
Speaker 1: I think mine might have an ISIS.

576
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:00,539
Speaker 1: I don't know.

577
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,624
Speaker 0: This one doesn't even have PCI.

578
00:34:01,644 --> 00:34:01,825
Speaker 0: Whoa.

579
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,634
Speaker 0: It only has PCI X six.

580
00:34:05,096 --> 00:34:05,537
Speaker 0: Yeah.

581
00:34:06,499 --> 00:34:07,341
Speaker 1: I don't even know anymore.

582
00:34:07,983 --> 00:34:20,342
Speaker 0: But seriously, anyone who says that buying a new computer periodically is more cost effective than building a slightly better computer yourself and then periodically upgrading it is flat out wrong.

583
00:34:20,362 --> 00:34:20,543
Speaker 0: Yes.

584
00:34:20,583 --> 00:34:23,876
Speaker 1: Now, it's situations for the Mac people out there, right?

585
00:34:23,917 --> 00:34:27,411
Speaker 1: Because in the Mac world, first of all, Apple, they're going to rip you off.

586
00:34:27,652 --> 00:34:27,833
Speaker 0: Yeah.

587
00:34:28,195 --> 00:34:32,090
Speaker 1: When you buy a brand new Mac, everybody knows they're overcharging for the RAM.

588
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:39,623
Speaker 1: And if you buy an Apple device, they overcharge and for the storage, it's like, oh, you want to get a sixty four gig iPhone instead of a thirty two gig iPhone.

589
00:34:39,965 --> 00:34:40,889
Speaker 1: That'll be one hundred bucks.

590
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:45,530
Speaker 1: Dude, I just paid one hundred dollars for one twenty eight gig as is SD card for my camera.

591
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:48,224
Speaker 1: You can't be charging me one hundred dollars for thirty two gigs.

592
00:34:48,726 --> 00:34:49,069
Speaker 1: Fuck you.

593
00:34:49,811 --> 00:34:51,481
Speaker 1: But in an iPad, what are you going to do?

594
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:54,835
Speaker 1: They don't let you open that shit up, which is why PCs are better than Macs.

595
00:34:56,842 --> 00:35:00,094
Speaker 1: And in fact, most Macs these days, you can hardly open that shit up.

596
00:35:00,697 --> 00:35:03,328
Speaker 1: I think they let you get to the RAM slots on some of them.

597
00:35:03,348 --> 00:35:04,773
Speaker 1: I'm not even sure which ones anymore.

598
00:35:04,893 --> 00:35:05,094
Speaker 0: Yep.

599
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:07,643
Speaker 1: And the Mac Pro is that big black thing now.

600
00:35:08,245 --> 00:35:12,603
Speaker 1: Like even that those video cards, it's like you can't just switch out those cards.

601
00:35:12,623 --> 00:35:14,591
Speaker 1: You don't know the OS X as a driver for that.

602
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:18,707
Speaker 1: You don't know, you know, that it's going to work in that weird slot or something.

603
00:35:19,149 --> 00:35:21,014
Speaker 1: And they're overcharging you by a lot.

604
00:35:21,816 --> 00:35:24,323
Speaker 1: So it really sucks big time.

605
00:35:24,704 --> 00:35:29,500
Speaker 1: You know, it not only do at max cost more, but upgrading them is like losing an option.

606
00:35:29,862 --> 00:35:35,512
Speaker 1: So you do kind of need to buy a new computer when they start sucking, which is right away because the video cards they come with are garbage.

607
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:35,874
Speaker 0: Yep.

608
00:35:36,014 --> 00:35:36,597
Speaker 0: And you know what I do.

609
00:35:36,657 --> 00:35:41,015
Speaker 0: as a result, every fall of the year old video cards in them, I just buy a new laptop.

610
00:35:41,898 --> 00:35:42,260
Speaker 0: You know what?

611
00:35:42,381 --> 00:35:46,215
Speaker 0: I have every old laptop I've ever owned because they don't stop working now.

612
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:51,911
Speaker 1: The other thing with Apple is in terms of what we said about running out of RAM.

613
00:35:51,931 --> 00:35:57,091
Speaker 1: OS X is just really shitty at using RAM compared to Windows, which is shitty compared to Linux.

614
00:35:57,252 --> 00:35:59,598
Speaker 1: OS X is awful at managing memory.

615
00:35:59,738 --> 00:36:00,480
Speaker 0: Can you back that up?

616
00:36:01,443 --> 00:36:01,684
Speaker 1: Yeah.

617
00:36:02,065 --> 00:36:05,516
Speaker 1: Everyone at my work, it's just like I'm running the same stuff.

618
00:36:05,556 --> 00:36:09,113
Speaker 1: everyone else is running, you know, Chrome and the virtual machine and whatever.

619
00:36:09,675 --> 00:36:12,364
Speaker 1: And you look at their Macs and they're just using way more RAM.

620
00:36:13,146 --> 00:36:13,327
Speaker 0: Huh?

621
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:14,491
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't know.

622
00:36:14,531 --> 00:36:17,865
Speaker 0: I honestly don't know enough about Apple memory management.

623
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,512
Speaker 1: It's like they open up Photoshop.

624
00:36:19,612 --> 00:36:20,456
Speaker 1: I open up Photoshop.

625
00:36:20,537 --> 00:36:21,923
Speaker 1: My computer is four gigs of RAM.

626
00:36:22,084 --> 00:36:22,727
Speaker 1: I'm just fine.

627
00:36:22,988 --> 00:36:24,573
Speaker 1: They're like, shit, I'm almost running out.

628
00:36:26,278 --> 00:36:26,539
Speaker 0: Huh?

629
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:27,301
Speaker 0: Yeah.

630
00:36:27,582 --> 00:36:28,705
Speaker 0: That's interesting, actually.

631
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:33,984
Speaker 1: So, and the thing is, Apple also be charging you so much for the extra RAM.

632
00:36:34,024 --> 00:36:44,504
Speaker 1: So you have to do is when you buy a Mac, get the lowest amount of RAM, hope you get a Mac that allows you to change the RAM, then go online and buy a RAM from some third party and put it in there yourself.

633
00:36:44,564 --> 00:36:45,729
Speaker 1: Don't let Apple store do it.

634
00:36:45,769 --> 00:36:45,849
Speaker 0: Yep.

635
00:36:46,751 --> 00:36:53,400
Speaker 0: So just skip all the Mac mini because I mean, every upgrade I could actually list every upgrade I've ever given to a computer in my entire life.

636
00:36:53,842 --> 00:36:55,691
Speaker 0: That's, that's sort of telling it on how useful this is.

637
00:36:56,172 --> 00:37:04,836
Speaker 0: My 486, SX2, it had four megabytes of RAM and I convinced my dad to spend $300 and we bought four more megabytes.

638
00:37:05,318 --> 00:37:08,168
Speaker 1: Ours had eight and I upped it to 16.

639
00:37:08,168 --> 00:37:10,616
Speaker 0: Let me tell you, when we got that, when we got up to eight.

640
00:37:10,817 --> 00:37:12,102
Speaker 1: No more boot disks.

641
00:37:12,182 --> 00:37:12,986
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

642
00:37:13,287 --> 00:37:15,074
Speaker 0: When we got the eight, I could play doom.

643
00:37:15,094 --> 00:37:16,702
Speaker 0: I didn't even use a boot disk for doom.

644
00:37:16,742 --> 00:37:25,879
Speaker 1: I'd hold F5 to boot into like, well I had eight, so I never used a boot disk for doom, but I didn't even have, once I had 16, I didn't even need a boot disk for Mac warrior two.

645
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,714
Speaker 0: I still used a boot disk for, oh, what did I use a boot disk for?

646
00:37:30,116 --> 00:37:33,750
Speaker 0: Some quest for glory games and fantasy empires because they perform better.

647
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:34,653
Speaker 0: if I did it that way.

648
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:37,021
Speaker 1: My friends had dual speed CD roms.

649
00:37:37,041 --> 00:37:38,346
Speaker 1: I had quad speed.

650
00:37:38,526 --> 00:37:40,473
Speaker 1: I could install doom so fast.

651
00:37:40,533 --> 00:37:42,278
Speaker 0: Man, you're like that kid with the Neo Geo.

652
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:42,900
Speaker 1: Yes.

653
00:37:44,485 --> 00:37:45,549
Speaker 0: So yeah, that was my upgrade.

654
00:37:45,569 --> 00:37:49,703
Speaker 0: And then, then the most important upgrade I ever did in my entire life to a computer.

655
00:37:49,723 --> 00:37:53,676
Speaker 0: We had a built-in, like Fort 16 sound cars, piece of shit.

656
00:37:54,458 --> 00:38:02,980
Speaker 0: I convinced my parents to buy me a sound blaster, all 32, my advanced wave effects.

657
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:08,415
Speaker 0: that when I installed that, then I would proceed to play tie fighter and X-wing.

658
00:38:09,017 --> 00:38:10,643
Speaker 0: The music in those games was MIDI.

659
00:38:10,924 --> 00:38:17,084
Speaker 0: And because the all 32 had it embedded, like real MIDI support and MIDI chips, uh, that music sounded amazing.

660
00:38:17,746 --> 00:38:20,636
Speaker 1: We had a sound blaster 16 from the start in the 46.

661
00:38:20,636 --> 00:38:23,186
Speaker 0: Oh, you didn't have advanced wave effects though.

662
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:28,802
Speaker 1: No, but that Pentium three, four 50 that I brought to RIT that I built myself in 1999 board.

663
00:38:28,822 --> 00:38:29,102
Speaker 1: Yeah.

664
00:38:29,122 --> 00:38:34,155
Speaker 1: That one had a sound blaster live.

665
00:38:34,316 --> 00:38:36,140
Speaker 0: Yeah.

666
00:38:36,441 --> 00:38:40,935
Speaker 1: I bought a sound blaster live with surround sound and I've had surround sound ever since.

667
00:38:41,036 --> 00:38:43,973
Speaker 0: In fact, I remember I got the one that had that like front panel with all that stuff.

668
00:38:44,033 --> 00:38:46,463
Speaker 1: because that, that I didn't have that ridiculous one.

669
00:38:46,483 --> 00:38:48,632
Speaker 1: I had the cheap sound blaster live.

670
00:38:48,652 --> 00:38:49,476
Speaker 1: Yeah.

671
00:38:49,516 --> 00:38:51,324
Speaker 0: I had the full on one, the five 12, what?

672
00:38:51,364 --> 00:38:54,115
Speaker 0: I don't, I even forget what they were called gold platinum.

673
00:38:54,176 --> 00:38:56,124
Speaker 1: I don't remember the silver one or whatever.

674
00:38:56,284 --> 00:38:56,585
Speaker 0: Yeah.

675
00:38:56,867 --> 00:39:01,690
Speaker 0: But remember I was really into like music and audio and I thought I'd use that front panel and the SPDIF and all that stuff.

676
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:02,272
Speaker 1: No, you weren't.

677
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:02,854
Speaker 1: Yeah.

678
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:03,839
Speaker 1: That was only if you're a musician.

679
00:39:03,859 --> 00:39:05,004
Speaker 0: I use the MIDI a lot.

680
00:39:06,109 --> 00:39:07,556
Speaker 1: I use the midi and games that use the midi.

681
00:39:07,817 --> 00:39:09,004
Speaker 0: I use the midi to compose too.

682
00:39:09,024 --> 00:39:10,230
Speaker 0: I had a pirated copy of Cakewalk.

683
00:39:11,312 --> 00:39:13,162
Speaker 1: I kind of want to copy Cakewalk, but didn't pirate one.

684
00:39:13,202 --> 00:39:13,363
Speaker 0: Yeah.

685
00:39:13,403 --> 00:39:16,235
Speaker 0: Ken had it and he gave it to me and we, we did a lot of midi back in the day.

686
00:39:16,677 --> 00:39:17,480
Speaker 1: Did not do midi.

687
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,066
Speaker 1: I did a video game.

688
00:39:19,327 --> 00:39:21,416
Speaker 0: I was, you know, I was really into midi.

689
00:39:21,456 --> 00:39:22,843
Speaker 0: Like I had a huge midi collection.

690
00:39:23,085 --> 00:39:27,877
Speaker 0: It's hanging out in that hard drive right next to, uh, uh, Hey people.

691
00:39:28,338 --> 00:39:28,839
Speaker 0: Yeah.

692
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:39,582
Speaker 0: So then we bought the Pentium 200 and I bought, I upgrade, I bought for that a video card.

693
00:39:39,883 --> 00:39:46,142
Speaker 1: That Pentium 3450 was the first time I bought a video card when I built the thing and I had a TNT too the day it came out.

694
00:39:46,203 --> 00:39:46,403
Speaker 1: Wow.

695
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:50,434
Speaker 0: I bought a creative graphics blaster extreme.

696
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,102
Speaker 0: That was when I could play GL quick.

697
00:39:55,122 --> 00:39:56,004
Speaker 0: That was amazing.

698
00:39:58,127 --> 00:40:08,116
Speaker 0: And I bought some more RAM for that thing at one point and I bought like an extra card on the back that gave me USBs and I didn't buy much else for it.

699
00:40:08,718 --> 00:40:14,037
Speaker 0: After that I bought, I got that SCSI card so I could have my SCSI Plextor CDR.

700
00:40:14,659 --> 00:40:19,094
Speaker 1: After that, there was just many, many years of various AMD mishmash because that shit was broken.

701
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:25,522
Speaker 0: But that was the era when you bought, you buy a motherboard and then you'd buy a processor and some RAM and video cards and stuff.

702
00:40:25,844 --> 00:40:31,038
Speaker 0: And then like you'd periodically just swap out individual components during the college years, early two thousands.

703
00:40:31,098 --> 00:40:34,809
Speaker 1: We kept, it was, you know, late, late nineties, early, just like buying stuff.

704
00:40:35,331 --> 00:40:42,142
Speaker 1: The acceleration in hardware, you know, performance was just so much and prices kept going down and old stuff and new stuff could come out.

705
00:40:42,162 --> 00:40:43,247
Speaker 1: That was actually way better.

706
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:49,835
Speaker 0: Like I bought an 800 megahertz processor and then six months later it was worth it to me to buy a gigahertz processor.

707
00:40:49,855 --> 00:40:50,015
Speaker 0: Yeah.

708
00:40:50,096 --> 00:40:51,140
Speaker 1: It was like golden age.

709
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:54,474
Speaker 1: Just kept buying stuff, buying stuff, switching CPU's in the same motherboard.

710
00:40:54,534 --> 00:40:54,915
Speaker 1: Yeah.

711
00:40:55,197 --> 00:40:55,819
Speaker 0: Slot A.

712
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:56,541
Speaker 1: Yeah.

713
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:57,765
Speaker 1: Craziness was going on.

714
00:40:57,785 --> 00:40:59,692
Speaker 1: Uh, Socket A mostly.

715
00:40:59,712 --> 00:41:00,856
Speaker 1: These are all Socket A machines.

716
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:01,137
Speaker 0: Yeah.

717
00:41:01,538 --> 00:41:09,932
Speaker 0: I had slot A until that motherboard exploded because I got hit by the, uh, bootleg Chinese industrial espionage, uh, capacitor problem on my a bit board.

718
00:41:10,012 --> 00:41:10,233
Speaker 1: Yep.

719
00:41:10,694 --> 00:41:20,547
Speaker 1: But ever since the, you know, the overclocking era too, but ever since the I three, I five, I seven era is hardly any reason to upgrade computers last so much longer now.

720
00:41:20,567 --> 00:41:21,089
Speaker 1: Yeah.

721
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:23,780
Speaker 0: Because I mean, you're limited pretty much by video card.

722
00:41:24,221 --> 00:41:27,213
Speaker 0: And if you're not limited by that, you're limited by disc IO.

723
00:41:27,233 --> 00:41:29,403
Speaker 0: I highly doubt anything else is limiting you.

724
00:41:29,865 --> 00:41:31,716
Speaker 1: And video cards are the only thing that are getting better.

725
00:41:31,736 --> 00:41:34,675
Speaker 1: And you might be like, well, how come video cards are getting better and CPU's aren't?

726
00:41:34,696 --> 00:41:35,219
Speaker 1: Well, here's the thing.

727
00:41:36,261 --> 00:41:46,826
Speaker 1: When they're making CPU's, especially these days, they're trying to make them faster, of course, but they don't want to make them less efficient, especially since they're mostly being used in laptops and things of that nature.

728
00:41:47,227 --> 00:41:51,100
Speaker 1: They want them to use less energy and also their general purpose.

729
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,818
Speaker 1: Yes, they do all, they're not specific, you know, geared towards this one task.

730
00:41:54,838 --> 00:41:55,882
Speaker 1: They need to be able to do anything.

731
00:41:56,604 --> 00:42:03,967
Speaker 0: So CPU's aren't getting that much faster, but they're not, not only are they not getting faster, they're getting slower.

732
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:17,579
Speaker 0: Clock speeds are going down to accommodate more cores, different memories, stuff like if you look at server hardware, like Xeons, like crazy stuff, higher end servers have lower clock speeds than what you would put in your desktop PC.

733
00:42:18,741 --> 00:42:29,600
Speaker 0: In fact, if you want high clock speeds, like really high clock speeds, a lot of the processors that have actually higher clock speeds have fewer cores or disabled cores or other trade-offs.

734
00:42:31,021 --> 00:42:33,932
Speaker 1: But video cards is the land of we don't give a fuck.

735
00:42:33,992 --> 00:42:34,856
Speaker 1: Why are they faster?

736
00:42:34,876 --> 00:42:38,430
Speaker 1: Well, the chips aren't actually like ridiculously that much.

737
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:41,663
Speaker 1: It's like the same fabrication technologies we have for CPU's.

738
00:42:41,683 --> 00:42:42,547
Speaker 1: It's not something special.

739
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,536
Speaker 1: It's that they just don't give a fuck.

740
00:42:44,556 --> 00:42:49,378
Speaker 1: So like, oh, let's just put like four GPU's on here with hella fans and use 10 zillion electricities.

741
00:42:49,398 --> 00:42:49,961
Speaker 0: Well, put it this way.

742
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:54,118
Speaker 0: If you have an SLI set up, like two video cards, that shit's bigger than my laptop.

743
00:42:54,419 --> 00:42:55,543
Speaker 0: It's like my whole laptop.

744
00:42:55,664 --> 00:42:57,450
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, my car is slow.

745
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:59,196
Speaker 1: I should get a better engine.

746
00:42:59,517 --> 00:43:01,162
Speaker 1: I already have a V12.

747
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:03,668
Speaker 1: I guess I'll just have two V12s then.

748
00:43:03,688 --> 00:43:05,673
Speaker 1: That's a video card.

749
00:43:06,014 --> 00:43:10,386
Speaker 1: Whereas, you know, the CPU is like, I've got a four cylinder turbo.

750
00:43:11,409 --> 00:43:12,572
Speaker 1: How can I make this faster?

751
00:43:13,274 --> 00:43:16,966
Speaker 1: It's really fucking hard without just button to V12 instead.

752
00:43:17,066 --> 00:43:25,800
Speaker 0: But at the same time, for a lot of what, especially you guys, like listeners of GeekKnives are doing with your computers, the video card matters more than everything else.

753
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:37,535
Speaker 0: So it's optimized to do the few things you do that actually tax a computer, which is matrix math, rendering images and holding textures and memory, applying them to services.

754
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:38,258
Speaker 1: Exactly.

755
00:43:38,278 --> 00:43:38,358
Speaker 0: Yeah.

756
00:43:38,378 --> 00:43:49,487
Speaker 0: I mean, my video editing, I mean, it would take about 25 hours in software only mode to render the video of the panel with the 4K.

757
00:43:49,908 --> 00:43:53,581
Speaker 0: But I started a test render to kind of scope it out and to test some stuff.

758
00:43:54,263 --> 00:43:54,724
Speaker 0: Nine hours.

759
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:55,386
Speaker 0: That's it.

760
00:43:55,987 --> 00:43:57,913
Speaker 0: Nine hours with the CUDA cores doing their thing.

761
00:43:58,134 --> 00:43:58,314
Speaker 1: Yep.

762
00:44:00,219 --> 00:44:02,146
Speaker 0: So yeah, if your computer is slow, video card.

763
00:44:02,748 --> 00:44:08,467
Speaker 0: If the video card isn't the problem, replace whatever disk your applications run from with an SSD.

764
00:44:09,269 --> 00:44:18,016
Speaker 0: If you're already on an SSD and you already have the second fastest video card, it's probably, you know, 90 percent of time.

765
00:44:18,096 --> 00:44:24,125
Speaker 1: if you have a PC and it's running poorly or even a Mac is running poorly, it's because you put a bunch of shitty fucking crap on there.

766
00:44:24,627 --> 00:44:32,038
Speaker 1: Clean up, reinstall your OS cleanly and don't fuck it up this time, because you still will every time because you're not me and everyone but me fucks it up.

767
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:34,970
Speaker 1: But try not to fuck it up as much as you did the last time.

768
00:44:35,813 --> 00:44:37,420
Speaker 1: Don't install your ghetto ass software.

769
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,750
Speaker 1: If you're not sure if software is ghetto ass, ask me.

770
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:40,614
Speaker 1: Yeah.

771
00:44:40,634 --> 00:44:47,642
Speaker 0: To summarize it actually more simply, you don't need to upgrade your computer most likely except for the video card and everything else.

772
00:44:47,823 --> 00:44:50,114
Speaker 1: And you definitely don't need to buy a new computer in the year 2014.

773
00:44:50,114 --> 00:44:52,022
Speaker 1: You just need to upgrade it.

774
00:44:52,384 --> 00:44:52,886
Speaker 0: Yeah.

775
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,874
Speaker 1: If you need to, which is unlikely.

776
00:44:55,175 --> 00:44:58,168
Speaker 0: And if you're going to build a brand new computer now, like say you're running.

777
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:01,603
Speaker 1: Maybe your computer actually is mad old because you have bad money.

778
00:45:01,623 --> 00:45:02,927
Speaker 1: Your computer is like 10 years old.

779
00:45:02,947 --> 00:45:04,793
Speaker 0: You've got like an AMD K7.

780
00:45:05,535 --> 00:45:05,796
Speaker 1: Right.

781
00:45:06,619 --> 00:45:13,075
Speaker 0: In that case, buy like a super fast, super awesome like core I5 or I7.

782
00:45:13,516 --> 00:45:17,789
Speaker 0: Get a good extensible motherboard with a whole bunch of dims and sadies and whatever.

783
00:45:19,254 --> 00:45:21,805
Speaker 0: Spend more money on the power supply than you think you should.

784
00:45:21,865 --> 00:45:23,655
Speaker 0: In fact, spend double what you think you should.

785
00:45:23,675 --> 00:45:24,077
Speaker 0: Yeah.

786
00:45:24,137 --> 00:45:25,442
Speaker 1: Don't I don't know.

787
00:45:25,683 --> 00:45:30,577
Speaker 0: Don't buy like a 10,000 watt like, oh my God, ridiculous power thing.

788
00:45:30,938 --> 00:45:34,268
Speaker 1: But also don't get the twenty dollar going to explode and not work thing.

789
00:45:34,369 --> 00:45:37,780
Speaker 0: Don't buy high wattage by high quality.

790
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:38,281
Speaker 1: Yeah.

791
00:45:38,301 --> 00:45:46,509
Speaker 1: I usually get like the four hundred five hundred watt, like super efficient and viral friendly and tech ultra reliable power supply.

792
00:45:46,569 --> 00:45:46,830
Speaker 0: Yeah.

793
00:45:47,091 --> 00:45:52,895
Speaker 0: But seriously, don't skimp on the power supply because if you had a problem, don't get a twenty dollar one.

794
00:45:53,076 --> 00:45:56,594
Speaker 0: I've noticed a lot of people are afraid of upgrading because they they hear horror stories.

795
00:45:56,614 --> 00:46:01,354
Speaker 0: They've experienced things where like they try to upgrade the computer because they built their own computer.

796
00:46:01,374 --> 00:46:02,458
Speaker 0: Yes.

797
00:46:02,498 --> 00:46:04,387
Speaker 1: An incompetent person screwed something up.

798
00:46:04,427 --> 00:46:09,911
Speaker 1: That is not a reason not to do the thing unless you are also incompetent, in which case you shouldn't not do the thing.

799
00:46:10,032 --> 00:46:11,960
Speaker 1: You should become not incompetent.

800
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:16,617
Speaker 0: There was a time where computers would fail to boot due to no fault of your own.

801
00:46:16,677 --> 00:46:20,430
Speaker 0: That time was the AMD case, K3 or K7, whatever era.

802
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:21,734
Speaker 0: Yes, we're past that.

803
00:46:21,834 --> 00:46:25,208
Speaker 1: And even during that era, just get an RMA on the part that's not working.

804
00:46:25,429 --> 00:46:25,650
Speaker 0: Yep.

805
00:46:25,871 --> 00:46:33,888
Speaker 0: Well, back then, like there'd be weird incompatibilities like of course you shouldn't have bought up whatever Northbridge coupled with a whatever video card in that particular brand.

806
00:46:33,908 --> 00:46:36,198
Speaker 1: You might say, well, I just don't want the hassle.

807
00:46:36,279 --> 00:46:38,166
Speaker 1: I'd rather spend money than have the hassle.

808
00:46:38,226 --> 00:46:40,495
Speaker 1: And that's called anti intellectual.

809
00:46:40,616 --> 00:46:43,829
Speaker 0: Now there's the forget that I'm not going to try to insult the listener.

810
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:45,355
Speaker 1: I insult the listener.

811
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:46,320
Speaker 0: I'll put it this way.

812
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,782
Speaker 0: Buying the new computer will not get you a performance improvement compared to just buying the video card.

813
00:46:53,063 --> 00:47:01,068
Speaker 0: And literally a child whose age is in the single digits could replace the video card given almost no instruction.

814
00:47:01,369 --> 00:47:05,302
Speaker 0: You just pulled the old one out and put the new one where the old one was.

815
00:47:05,603 --> 00:47:07,328
Speaker 1: And maybe upgrade the driver.

816
00:47:07,348 --> 00:47:15,752
Speaker 0: Now I guess the worst thing that can happen is if you pull the old one out and it turns out that the slot it was plugged into you is like AGP.

817
00:47:15,772 --> 00:47:19,462
Speaker 1: Buy a new computer if that's the case.

818
00:47:19,663 --> 00:47:19,924
Speaker 0: Yep.

819
00:47:20,165 --> 00:47:25,421
Speaker 1: If your computer does not have a PCI express x16 slot, you need a new computer.

820
00:47:27,688 --> 00:47:31,980
Speaker 0: But a $400 video card will buy you more than almost anything else you can do to your computer.

821
00:47:37,266 --> 00:47:39,508
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

822
00:47:39,548 --> 00:47:44,703
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.
