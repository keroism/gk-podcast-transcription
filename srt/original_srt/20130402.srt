1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,268
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, April 2nd, 2013.

2
00:00:10,268 --> 00:00:10,470
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,705 --> 00:00:13,159
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,808
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,900
Speaker 1: Tonight, ground floor.

6
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:21,219
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,979
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, and I guess we're back from PAX.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:28,385
Speaker 0: Hooray.

9
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,587
Speaker 0: Geek Nights has returned.

10
00:00:30,627 --> 00:00:33,479
Speaker 0: We are not a dead podcast like all those before us.

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,544
Speaker 1: Mostly returned.

12
00:00:34,985 --> 00:00:38,720
Speaker 1: I got back from PAX and went to work and everything was fine for like two days.

13
00:00:39,543 --> 00:00:40,286
Speaker 1: And then I got sick.

14
00:00:40,547 --> 00:00:43,218
Speaker 1: And it wasn't just the normal like, "Oh, I'm sick after a

15
00:00:43,258 --> 00:00:43,539
Speaker 1: con.".

16
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:47,140
Speaker 1: I had influenza, like an actual flu.

17
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,180
Speaker 0: Did you go to a doctor?

18
00:00:49,023 --> 00:00:50,540
Speaker 1: No, because there's no point.

19
00:00:52,301 --> 00:00:57,240
Speaker 1: Unless they were going to give me a tube or something, there's nothing to do for a flu unless you're dying of it.

20
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:57,945
Speaker 1: I wasn't dying.

21
00:00:57,965 --> 00:00:58,872
Speaker 1: I just had 103 fever.

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:00,999
Speaker 0: That sounds like dying.

23
00:01:02,505 --> 00:01:03,340
Speaker 1: I've had worse fevers.

24
00:01:04,241 --> 00:01:08,280
Speaker 1: This was easily the sickest I've been in about a decade.

25
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,740
Speaker 1: And today is the first day I'm not horribly ill.

26
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,800
Speaker 1: So I brought Scott over into the plague house to hopefully catch some plague and experience this the way I did.

27
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,000
Speaker 0: I did call in sick today so that I could do laundry and play X-Com.

28
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,320
Speaker 1: It would thus be ironic if you actually got sick.

29
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,500
Speaker 0: It would be indeed, but that's okay.

30
00:01:29,123 --> 00:01:29,608
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

31
00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:30,579
Speaker 0: I don't want to get sick.

32
00:01:31,722 --> 00:01:34,477
Speaker 1: I hope none of your coworkers listen to this like, "I thought Scott called in

33
00:01:34,537 --> 00:01:34,859
Speaker 1: sick.".

34
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:35,467
Speaker 0: Whatever.

35
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,098
Speaker 0: They don't give a shit.

36
00:01:37,743 --> 00:01:39,620
Speaker 0: I haven't been sick from work in like forever.

37
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:40,789
Speaker 0: I have five sick days.

38
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:41,820
Speaker 0: They reset in July.

39
00:01:42,584 --> 00:01:43,237
Speaker 0: I'm going to use them.

40
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,666
Speaker 0: I'll probably use another one.

41
00:01:44,686 --> 00:01:46,380
Speaker 0: It's like go biking in June or something.

42
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,020
Speaker 1: See guys, this is why if you're on a company, you're better off just giving your employees unlimited sick days.

43
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,458
Speaker 0: That's right.

44
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,960
Speaker 1: They don't feel obligated to use up the sick days you give them.

45
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,580
Speaker 0: If I had unlimited sick days, I would have gone to work today because you don't want to be caught abusing the infinite sick day policy.

46
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:05,879
Speaker 0: But if you have a set number, it's like, "Well, that's how many days I'm going to be sick minimum.

47
00:02:06,741 --> 00:02:11,959
Speaker 0: If I'm legitimately sick longer than that, then oh well, I'm going to get a doctor's

48
00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:12,140
Speaker 0: note.".

49
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,260
Speaker 1: No, then I'm coming to work anyway.

50
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,520
Speaker 0: Also that and getting all the other employees sick and ruining your company.

51
00:02:20,263 --> 00:02:21,238
Speaker 1: I guess you got nothing else to say?

52
00:02:23,044 --> 00:02:24,280
Speaker 0: Not until we get started.

53
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,185
Speaker 1: We're started.

54
00:02:25,205 --> 00:02:26,436
Speaker 1: It's live.

55
00:02:26,476 --> 00:02:26,940
Speaker 1: We're back.

56
00:02:27,362 --> 00:02:27,924
Speaker 0: Okay, sure.

57
00:02:27,944 --> 00:02:31,500
Speaker 0: You want to do some news, I guess?

58
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:32,344
Speaker 1: I don't know.

59
00:02:32,364 --> 00:02:34,079
Speaker 1: I don't really have any news except for PAX.

60
00:02:35,141 --> 00:02:36,858
Speaker 0: What about PAX that we went to?

61
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,860
Speaker 1: PAX is pretty great.

62
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,543
Speaker 0: It was PAX East 2013.

63
00:02:40,543 --> 00:02:41,040
Speaker 0: More importantly.

64
00:02:41,768 --> 00:02:42,160
Speaker 1: Our ninth PAX?

65
00:02:43,042 --> 00:02:45,050
Speaker 1: It was our 22nd panel out of PAX.

66
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:48,018
Speaker 0: Okay.

67
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,280
Speaker 1: Which was kind of, we've done more PAX panels.

68
00:02:50,381 --> 00:02:52,859
Speaker 0: How have we done 22 panels in nine PAXs?

69
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:58,540
Speaker 1: Because we used to do three panels per PAX for several PAXs in a row.

70
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,860
Speaker 0: All right, now we're doing one.

71
00:03:00,362 --> 00:03:01,178
Speaker 0: Oh, we did two this time.

72
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,640
Speaker 1: We did two, but they were in the little theater.

73
00:03:04,282 --> 00:03:06,940
Speaker 0: The tabletop theater that needs to be renamed desperately.

74
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:07,508
Speaker 1: Kobold.

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,580
Speaker 0: We're thinking Kobold Theater, but it might be something else.

76
00:03:10,801 --> 00:03:12,780
Speaker 1: I can't come up with a name better than Kobold Theater.

77
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,238
Speaker 1: But yeah, we got to experience PAX from a very different perspective too.

78
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,660
Speaker 1: Many of you know because we tweeted about it and talked about it, but we actually were enforcers this year.

79
00:03:21,742 --> 00:03:22,600
Speaker 1: Me, Scott, and Emily.

80
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:24,740
Speaker 1: We were on the other side.

81
00:03:24,781 --> 00:03:26,079
Speaker 0: Emily was an enforcer last year.

82
00:03:26,383 --> 00:03:26,639
Speaker 1: She was.

83
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,280
Speaker 1: She was a veteran.

84
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:29,360
Speaker 1: She has an extra pin beyond what I have.

85
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:29,731
Speaker 0: Oh no.

86
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:35,820
Speaker 1: But we've seen the inner secrets of the enforcers and we can reveal all their secrets to you now.

87
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,760
Speaker 0: All the non-really exciting secrets.

88
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,738
Speaker 1: You know what the secrets are?

89
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,419
Speaker 1: They're smart people who are allowed to act with their smartness and they just do the right thing to make PAX happen.

90
00:03:46,287 --> 00:03:46,498
Speaker 1: That's it.

91
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,280
Speaker 1: That's the secret.

92
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:48,939
Speaker 0: All staff confident.

93
00:03:49,505 --> 00:03:49,677
Speaker 0: The end.

94
00:03:49,801 --> 00:03:50,890
Speaker 0: Well, staff 99% confident.

95
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,680
Speaker 1: I did not meet an incompetent enforcer.

96
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:02,620
Speaker 0: No, I did not meet an incompetent enforcer, but there were people who were mostly confident, but had some amount of incompetence to them.

97
00:04:02,901 --> 00:04:04,980
Speaker 1: I believe all people have some amount of incompetence.

98
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,738
Speaker 0: That's what I said.

99
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,379
Speaker 1: I lost an episode of Geek Nights to Ether one time.

100
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,349
Speaker 0: That's why I said 99% confident.

101
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,940
Speaker 1: You apparently didn't realize that you can change volumes and recordings of audio.

102
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:14,407
Speaker 0: I do.

103
00:04:14,761 --> 00:04:15,737
Speaker 0: I'm just too lazy to do so.

104
00:04:18,661 --> 00:04:21,459
Speaker 1: But yeah, PAX was the same as PAX always is.

105
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:22,519
Speaker 1: The expo hall was bigger.

106
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,840
Speaker 1: Tabletop seemed smaller, but it was, it appears that it was actually slightly bigger.

107
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:42,974
Speaker 0: Well, it's hard to tell, but they changed the shape of it and we don't, I didn't count the chairs, so there's no way to know, but at least, uh, whether it was bigger or smaller, it was, there was always somewhere to sit at least, you know, even when it was super full, there was like a chair here and a chair

108
00:04:43,175 --> 00:04:43,377
Speaker 1: there.

109
00:04:43,844 --> 00:04:44,299
Speaker 0: Not like that.

110
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,952
Speaker 0: And you know, a year ago it was 100% full.

111
00:04:47,062 --> 00:04:48,000
Speaker 0: You cannot sit in there.

112
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,600
Speaker 0: You have to go to extra tabletop.

113
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,880
Speaker 1: But the thing is last year there was extra tabletop.

114
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,900
Speaker 0: And this year there was not.

115
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:04,599
Speaker 1: And now that extra tabletop was gone and yet regular tabletop was not full the whole time, either there was more space in tabletop, which I don't think there actually was.

116
00:05:05,161 --> 00:05:09,340
Speaker 1: Two, there was more space elsewhere in the con that people were tabletop gaming.

117
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,098
Speaker 0: Seemed about the same.

118
00:05:10,982 --> 00:05:13,060
Speaker 1: Three, less people were tabletop.

119
00:05:13,321 --> 00:05:16,477
Speaker 0: I think that might be somewhat true.

120
00:05:17,481 --> 00:05:19,740
Speaker 0: Uh, let me, let me tell you a story, right?

121
00:05:20,221 --> 00:05:29,320
Speaker 0: So I'm enforcing and I'm standing in the area between the expo hall and the tabletop sort of near the, uh, the line for, you know, swag bags and such, right?

122
00:05:29,526 --> 00:05:29,840
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

123
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,596
Speaker 0: There's an old dude, middle aged dude, maybe 40, 50 something.

124
00:05:33,462 --> 00:05:35,778
Speaker 0: And his son who is way young listeners.

125
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,799
Speaker 1: I just want to let you know, this is a story that you're going to be amazed by.

126
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:39,837
Speaker 0: Yeah.

127
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,019
Speaker 0: Maybe eight, nine years old, something like that.

128
00:05:42,187 --> 00:05:42,357
Speaker 0: Right.

129
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:49,600
Speaker 0: And you know, the guy, you know, I'm standing there and what's happening in this area is the Mike and Jerry autograph signing.

130
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:49,892
Speaker 0: Right.

131
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:50,617
Speaker 0: And there's a line.

132
00:05:51,301 --> 00:05:54,060
Speaker 0: This dude asked me, Hey, what's his line for it?

133
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,720
Speaker 0: I'm like, Oh, Mike and Jerry autograph signing, you know, and pin trading also.

134
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:58,219
Speaker 0: Right.

135
00:05:58,723 --> 00:06:00,519
Speaker 0: And he's like, who are they?

136
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:02,540
Speaker 0: And I'm like, you know, that's understandable.

137
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:02,840
Speaker 0: Right.

138
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,180
Speaker 0: Not everyone that comes to PAX knows about penny arcade.

139
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:06,633
Speaker 0: Right.

140
00:06:06,841 --> 00:06:08,440
Speaker 0: Not everyone knows who Mike and Jerry are.

141
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,058
Speaker 0: And I'm like, Oh, well.

142
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,274
Speaker 0: Yeah.

143
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,059
Speaker 1: I mean, how many people go to anime cons and don't know who anime is?

144
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:12,600
Speaker 0: Right.

145
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,000
Speaker 0: Of course.

146
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,058
Speaker 0: So I'm like, Oh, well, you know, it's the penny arcade expo.

147
00:06:17,922 --> 00:06:20,200
Speaker 0: Uh, these guys, you know, are the reason we're here.

148
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,780
Speaker 0: They made a web comic called penny arcade about, you know, 10 plus years ago.

149
00:06:23,907 --> 00:06:24,140
Speaker 0: Right.

150
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:30,400
Speaker 0: And you know, from that web comic, they have created this convention, which is in three places in the world every year.

151
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,120
Speaker 0: And you know, you're at it right now.

152
00:06:32,221 --> 00:06:33,900
Speaker 0: Welcome to our penny arcade.

153
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:34,320
Speaker 0: Right.

154
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:41,760
Speaker 0: And he's like, first of all, I don't remember the, I'm not going to exactly remember every word that was said, but here's the gist.

155
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:47,520
Speaker 0: Number one, uh, he didn't realize that packs was penny arcade expo.

156
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,319
Speaker 0: It took him like a few minutes to get that.

157
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:49,979
Speaker 0: Right.

158
00:06:50,641 --> 00:06:53,520
Speaker 0: Uh, he was like, Oh, packs penny arcade expo.

159
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,020
Speaker 0: He didn't realize they were the same thing.

160
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:59,580
Speaker 0: He thought right that he was here with his kid for packs.

161
00:06:59,620 --> 00:06:59,690
Speaker 0: Yes.

162
00:07:00,361 --> 00:07:07,640
Speaker 0: He thought the expo hall was packs physically speaking, and he thought that all this stuff going on behind that wall was another convention.

163
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:15,160
Speaker 0: Now when I said penny arcade expo, he thought I was talking about something that wasn't packs that was in the rest of the convention center.

164
00:07:15,664 --> 00:07:16,879
Speaker 0: That wasn't the expo hall.

165
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,060
Speaker 0: Now,

166
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:32,219
Speaker 1: while that seems crazy in retrospect, thinking about it a little bit, and you can understand why normal people would think that because normal people who don't go to a lot of conventions or who only go to like New York comic con, San Diego, comic con, dragon con, things like that.

167
00:07:32,741 --> 00:07:37,060
Speaker 1: They expect conventions to pretty much be a gigantic expo hall and little else.

168
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,352
Speaker 1: Right.

169
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,300
Speaker 0: It's like you go to the auto show, it's one big room and that's it.

170
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,640
Speaker 0: So this guy bought tickets to packs, came to packs East.

171
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:46,180
Speaker 0: And if you think about it, you come to packs East, there's an info booth.

172
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:52,619
Speaker 0: You go in the front door and there's the expo hall and there's walls and weird hallways to go to anything else.

173
00:07:53,581 --> 00:08:04,518
Speaker 0: And you don't get your program and all that stuff that gives you information about the other or the maps or anything unless you go beyond the expo hall to the baggy area behind it where the guy was.

174
00:08:05,032 --> 00:08:05,220
Speaker 0: All right.

175
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,320
Speaker 0: So I pointed him obviously to go get a program.

176
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:08,000
Speaker 0: Right.

177
00:08:08,341 --> 00:08:14,800
Speaker 0: And I told him, yeah, this entire building, even these hallways on the side that you don't see and in the back is all packs.

178
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,219
Speaker 0: You have a badge to all of this.

179
00:08:16,901 --> 00:08:20,198
Speaker 0: You're missing 90 percent of what's going on if you only stay in that room, et cetera.

180
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:24,720
Speaker 0: But, you know, I was talking about how, yeah, Penny Arcade is it's a webcomic.

181
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:29,980
Speaker 0: And the last thing the guy was like, yeah, I've never heard of Penny Arcade, the webcomic.

182
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,320
Speaker 0: I'm like, oh, well, when you go home, you know, search for Penny Arcade, the webcomic.

183
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,977
Speaker 0: And he's like, oh, maybe my kid has heard of Penny Arcade, the webcomic.

184
00:08:37,241 --> 00:08:40,919
Speaker 0: So I'm like, I'm going to go to the kid and I'm like, hey, have you heard of the webcomic Penny Arcade?

185
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,900
Speaker 0: And he says, I don't know, apparently, you know, he was failing at the English comprehension.

186
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,258
Speaker 1: Little kids are like that.

187
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:47,540
Speaker 0: Right.

188
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:53,120
Speaker 0: But he was like, he said to me, these are the exact words is the webcomic homestuck.

189
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:01,619
Speaker 0: So few words to a yes or no question of have you heard of Penny Arcade, the webcomic?

190
00:09:02,123 --> 00:09:03,720
Speaker 0: He said, is that homestuck?

191
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:16,099
Speaker 1: Well, no, Penny Arcade is so few words, but have so adequately expressed the youth of America coming up into this world as is that homestuck?

192
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:20,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, no, Penny Arcade is not homestuck.

193
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,720
Speaker 0: The letter A is not the letter B. Apples are not oranges.

194
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:30,432
Speaker 1: I feel like we could turn that back into some sort of old, you know, the old, is this Battletoads memes?

195
00:09:30,621 --> 00:09:31,719
Speaker 1: Like, is this homestuck?

196
00:09:32,163 --> 00:09:32,420
Speaker 0: Yeah.

197
00:09:33,242 --> 00:09:38,460
Speaker 0: I asked Robert Koo, you know, if there was a way that we can better serve these people and he said he didn't seem too worried about it.

198
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,540
Speaker 0: He's like, yeah, people like that come to the convention, whatever.

199
00:09:41,124 --> 00:09:41,699
Speaker 0: We have maps.

200
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,534
Speaker 0: It's up to them.

201
00:09:43,481 --> 00:09:45,894
Speaker 0: And I was like, and the thing is, you can't hand out.

202
00:09:46,095 --> 00:09:48,879
Speaker 0: the one thing you could think of would be to hand out the programs in the front.

203
00:09:49,624 --> 00:09:50,659
Speaker 0: But there's nowhere to do that.

204
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,397
Speaker 0: There's no space.

205
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:51,710
Speaker 1: Yep.

206
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,760
Speaker 1: There's not enough space to line people up inside.

207
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,260
Speaker 0: And I don't think you could put the X ball hall.

208
00:09:56,721 --> 00:10:01,020
Speaker 0: You could put the Q room closer to the front of the con and move the X ball hall back.

209
00:10:01,665 --> 00:10:01,897
Speaker 0: Right.

210
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:06,411
Speaker 0: But then that sort of ruins that whole effect of looking in the window and seeing the X ball.

211
00:10:07,729 --> 00:10:08,038
Speaker 0: I don't know.

212
00:10:08,764 --> 00:10:10,060
Speaker 1: I don't think there's any good way around it.

213
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,280
Speaker 1: But all that really does is solidify that point that I was talking about.

214
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,019
Speaker 0: If you go to PAX Prime, all right, that shit's a maze.

215
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,820
Speaker 1: We've talked about this over and over, over again on Geek Notes.

216
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,560
Speaker 1: There are just people who are really into something who somehow are so off the radar.

217
00:10:25,122 --> 00:10:27,759
Speaker 1: It's like they have a hobby that they've never Googled for.

218
00:10:28,301 --> 00:10:31,160
Speaker 1: They've never looked up on the Internet with any other search engine.

219
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,636
Speaker 0: They're going to this PAX thing, but they didn't bother to look up anything about this thing they're going to.

220
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,480
Speaker 1: They seem to know it's about video games.

221
00:10:37,841 --> 00:10:43,320
Speaker 1: They somehow bought tickets online in advance, despite the fact that it sold out pretty quick.

222
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:43,913
Speaker 0: Yeah.

223
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,780
Speaker 0: They somehow got to go to it.

224
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,340
Speaker 0: Maybe they read about it in the Boston newspaper or something.

225
00:10:48,842 --> 00:10:49,194
Speaker 0: I don't know.

226
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:58,540
Speaker 1: But just how there are so many nerds who are really nerdy about something yet seem to just never take it upon themselves to learn more about the thing.

227
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,136
Speaker 0: Whatever.

228
00:11:00,981 --> 00:11:03,260
Speaker 1: Maybe we just need to brand all those things as home stock.

229
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:08,519
Speaker 0: So the only other thing I want to say about PAX, you know, PAX is like the home stock of video games.

230
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,100
Speaker 0: Sure.

231
00:11:10,342 --> 00:11:12,940
Speaker 0: Is in the X, you know, things I saw at PAX that were cool.

232
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:16,360
Speaker 0: I was enforcing a lot and doing panels a lot, so I didn't see too many cool things.

233
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:16,876
Speaker 1: Yeah.

234
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:21,060
Speaker 1: I walked through the expo hall once on my own because I never met up with you when you were walking through.

235
00:11:21,421 --> 00:11:25,579
Speaker 0: And I told you I was with at the only booth in the back right with George and you didn't.

236
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,920
Speaker 1: I was walking over there.

237
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,980
Speaker 1: And then by the time I got there, you guys, I waited there for like five, 10 minutes.

238
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,596
Speaker 0: You didn't show up.

239
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:40,659
Speaker 0: Anyway, I walked around that expo hall and the one thing the expo hall that really stood out that I remember that was that I'm going to spend money for for sure is this game called Shovel Knight.

240
00:11:41,682 --> 00:11:45,540
Speaker 0: So Shovel Knight, I think, is coming out for PC, might be coming out for some other things.

241
00:11:45,741 --> 00:11:47,536
Speaker 0: You can look it up online, see videos of it.

242
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:58,259
Speaker 0: Basically, it is a game that combines all the greatest aspects of all these games that I have already know and love.

243
00:11:58,521 --> 00:12:01,920
Speaker 0: So you're a knight and you have a shovel as your weapon, right?

244
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:02,897
Speaker 0: You can dig with it.

245
00:12:03,402 --> 00:12:07,400
Speaker 0: So it's a 2D platform game that looks like an NES game.

246
00:12:07,902 --> 00:12:10,320
Speaker 0: And the level design is very much like Megaman.

247
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,080
Speaker 0: And there are many Megaman-esque enemies in it.

248
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,860
Speaker 0: So you're playing a lot like Megaman.

249
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,300
Speaker 0: You can jump and you can shovel.

250
00:12:16,882 --> 00:12:20,020
Speaker 1: But the way your powers are, you're a little also like a Scrooge McDuck.

251
00:12:20,341 --> 00:12:23,998
Speaker 0: Well, OK, so there's a little bit of Scrooge McDuck in the things you can do with the shovel.

252
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,740
Speaker 0: For example, you can down stab onto a guy to bounce off of him like a Scrooge McDuck.

253
00:12:29,101 --> 00:12:34,283
Speaker 0: You can also down stab like a Zelda, like a link from Zelda 2.

254
00:12:34,283 --> 00:12:39,880
Speaker 0: You can also use the shovel to reflect shots back at enemies, sort of like a Zelda 2 link.

255
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,660
Speaker 0: You can also press up and attack to use a secondary weapon like a Castlevania.

256
00:12:47,961 --> 00:12:52,820
Speaker 0: So it's like you have secrets in the levels like a Kirby's adventure.

257
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:59,679
Speaker 0: Wait, so Scott, it's a typical 8-bit throwback game, but it's got all those aspects from all those things.

258
00:12:59,781 --> 00:13:01,100
Speaker 1: It's got Scott's best aspects.

259
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:11,700
Speaker 0: All the best aspects from the best games combined into one plus, right, the controls and the designs and the arts were all super perfect.

260
00:13:12,161 --> 00:13:15,300
Speaker 0: Usually a lot of these games come out and they're a little flimsy in one way or another.

261
00:13:15,622 --> 00:13:16,800
Speaker 0: This game wasn't even out yet.

262
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,660
Speaker 0: It was just like PAX demo and already the controls were like dead on.

263
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,359
Speaker 0: It was so good.

264
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,238
Speaker 1: How long did you play it?

265
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,019
Speaker 0: For like five minutes, ten minutes, something like that.

266
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:26,500
Speaker 0: Enough to like beat a whole level.

267
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,075
Speaker 1: I'll believe it.

268
00:13:27,503 --> 00:13:27,594
Speaker 0: Yeah.

269
00:13:28,861 --> 00:13:32,120
Speaker 0: So when you see Shovel Knight hitting Steam, buy that shit.

270
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:41,779
Speaker 1: I was pretty excited about, not that I knew about this game, but I kind of just ignored it like it was in the file of games I planned to play at some point, but that Don't Starve that people were talking about.

271
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,360
Speaker 0: I've heard of that.

272
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,160
Speaker 1: I looked at it and it looked cool.

273
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:43,580
Speaker 0: What's it about?

274
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:45,720
Speaker 1: You really don't know anything about it?

275
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,158
Speaker 0: I've heard there's a game called Don't Starve.

276
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,560
Speaker 0: So the deal is... Is it a scary game I think?

277
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,800
Speaker 1: You're a dude by yourself in a world and you have to not starve.

278
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:58,200
Speaker 1: So, I don't know, start fucking farming before you die.

279
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,040
Speaker 0: Okay.

280
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:08,380
Speaker 1: Grab some, you know, think of it as like an adventure game with a little bit of this sort of Minecraft, like go and get things to do things with and build your little settlement.

281
00:14:09,642 --> 00:14:14,277
Speaker 1: It sounds really fun and now that I've actually seen it and poked at it a little bit, it looks really fun too.

282
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,000
Speaker 1: So I think I'm going to move it up in my queue.

283
00:14:16,382 --> 00:14:16,446
Speaker 0: Mmm.

284
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:22,866
Speaker 0: Bargo, bargo, bargo, bargo, bargo, bargo, bargo.

285
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:29,250
Speaker 1: But the game I'm the most excited about that I saw that was new to me is the DuckTales remake.

286
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:30,910
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, it was new to everybody.

287
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:38,730
Speaker 1: Because DuckTales, what's funny is just before PAX, I was showing some people who'd never heard of it, the DuckTales NES game in our apartment.

288
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:44,069
Speaker 0: Just before PAX, I happened to have been playing it on my NES emulator on my DS before going to bed.

289
00:14:44,411 --> 00:14:45,710
Speaker 0: And that game is balls hard.

290
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,070
Speaker 1: Serendipity, that game is, you know, I beat it as a kid many times.

291
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,129
Speaker 0: Game is balls hard.

292
00:14:50,571 --> 00:14:51,830
Speaker 1: I would be hard pressed to beat it today.

293
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,169
Speaker 0: I was dying in like level two.

294
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,047
Speaker 0: I was just like, ah.

295
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:54,887
Speaker 1: Wait, level two.

296
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,944
Speaker 1: Which, what order do you do?

297
00:14:56,984 --> 00:14:57,770
Speaker 1: the levels in, Scott?

298
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:58,510
Speaker 1: It's like Mega Man.

299
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,290
Speaker 1: It's very important.

300
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,810
Speaker 0: Well, I mean the first level, you don't have a choice, right?

301
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:02,019
Speaker 0: No.

302
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,110
Speaker 0: It's just the side scrolly forest level with the monkeys.

303
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:05,421
Speaker 0: What?

304
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:05,675
Speaker 1: No.

305
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,650
Speaker 1: You can pick whatever level you want.

306
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:08,498
Speaker 0: What?

307
00:15:09,012 --> 00:15:10,750
Speaker 0: I pushed start and I was in that monkey level.

308
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,589
Speaker 1: That is not how that game works.

309
00:15:13,515 --> 00:15:14,430
Speaker 0: I gotta go back and check.

310
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:19,393
Speaker 1: You just pick a place and go to, are you sure you're not referring to DuckTales 2?

311
00:15:19,393 --> 00:15:20,390
Speaker 0: Maybe I played the wrong one.

312
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,870
Speaker 0: I was definitely screwed to McDuck using the pogo stick cane.

313
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:27,010
Speaker 0: Okay, so apparently I just pushed start and went to the Amazon directly.

314
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,390
Speaker 1: Scott, that game is burned into my memory.

315
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:29,965
Speaker 0: Okay.

316
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,405
Speaker 0: But I didn't own it as a kid.

317
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,029
Speaker 0: I only played it like a few times.

318
00:15:33,193 --> 00:15:33,670
Speaker 0: I owned it.

319
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,369
Speaker 0: At some other people's houses.

320
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:42,930
Speaker 1: It amazes me that it's one of those games I could beat pretty handily as a kid that I have some surprising difficulty with re-beating today.

321
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:44,569
Speaker 0: Yeah, Mega Man 2 I can beat today, but.

322
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:45,730
Speaker 1: I don't know.

323
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,073
Speaker 1: When is the last time you beat Mega Man 2?

324
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,470
Speaker 0: You wanna play right now?

325
00:15:49,675 --> 00:15:50,086
Speaker 1: Let's see.

326
00:15:50,611 --> 00:15:53,269
Speaker 1: Which one was Mega Man 2 or Bionic Commando first?

327
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,609
Speaker 0: Bionic Commando 2 I think is a shorter game, right?

328
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:57,183
Speaker 0: I mean.

329
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:06,809
Speaker 0: Let's go see what the top scores are for speed runs with non-assisted for both those games and we can see if they're roughly the same speed game.

330
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,249
Speaker 1: That'll be our omega-thon.

331
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,719
Speaker 0: And what we can do is, right, we can both do it.

332
00:16:11,422 --> 00:16:20,350
Speaker 0: and then instead of just saying who is faster, we say who had a greater percentage overage versus the world record, right?

333
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:33,649
Speaker 0: So if I was 50% slower than the best at Mega Man 2, and you were 60% slower than the best at Bionic Commando, then, right, you're better at Bionic Commando than I am at Mega Man 2, That could be interesting.

334
00:16:34,991 --> 00:16:36,630
Speaker 1: But yeah, otherwise, I mean, PAX was PAX.

335
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,130
Speaker 1: The concerts were the concerts.

336
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:41,987
Speaker 1: There was a band, a new band at PAX that I actually wanted to see.

337
00:16:42,027 --> 00:16:43,306
Speaker 1: that I ended up not going to see.

338
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:52,350
Speaker 1: I was who, when they fight, do something about fighting, I already forgot because everyone I talked to who saw them said that they weren't actually that good.

339
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:53,950
Speaker 1: So I'm kind of glad I didn't bother.

340
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:59,590
Speaker 1: They were supposed to be a Final Fantasy themed equivalent of the Proto Man.

341
00:17:01,231 --> 00:17:06,970
Speaker 1: That's how they were described by many people to me with the added bonus of really good rock ballad vocals.

342
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:10,169
Speaker 1: It turns out that's not exactly what they are.

343
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:14,890
Speaker 1: And everyone I talked to who told me to listen to them told me never mind.

344
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,868
Speaker 0: Was it a Friday night concert or a Saturday night?

345
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:17,909
Speaker 0: Friday night.

346
00:17:18,676 --> 00:17:19,329
Speaker 0: Those who fight.

347
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:19,990
Speaker 1: Those who fight.

348
00:17:20,592 --> 00:17:21,589
Speaker 1: So I did not hear them.

349
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,150
Speaker 1: I did not see them perform.

350
00:17:23,671 --> 00:17:27,430
Speaker 1: But everyone who told me to see them later told me never mind.

351
00:17:28,394 --> 00:17:28,626
Speaker 0: Okay.

352
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,850
Speaker 1: But I mean, everything else was the same.

353
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,370
Speaker 1: I mean, the concert was full.

354
00:17:33,197 --> 00:17:33,286
Speaker 0: Sure.

355
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,428
Speaker 0: Magfest, though.

356
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,129
Speaker 0: Machine supremacy.

357
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:37,930
Speaker 1: That's a whole different ballgame.

358
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,030
Speaker 0: What are you going to do?

359
00:17:40,992 --> 00:17:44,510
Speaker 1: I wonder if there's going to be trouble at Magfest with that big a concert there.

360
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,390
Speaker 1: They don't have that big a venue for the concert.

361
00:17:46,671 --> 00:17:47,330
Speaker 0: It's not going to be that big.

362
00:17:47,892 --> 00:17:50,270
Speaker 0: It's going to be as big as any of the biggest concerts at Magfest.

363
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,310
Speaker 1: But they've never toured in the US ever, have they?

364
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:56,810
Speaker 0: You think a whole, you think a zillion people are going to suddenly show up at Magfest for machine supremacy?

365
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,510
Speaker 0: Who have never gone to Magfest before?

366
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:04,390
Speaker 1: A ticket to Magfest is not really out of line with a ticket to a major stadium concert.

367
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:04,717
Speaker 0: No.

368
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:07,189
Speaker 0: But it's not, they're not a major stadium group.

369
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:08,869
Speaker 1: You never know.

370
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:14,349
Speaker 0: You think there's that many people in the US that are going to go all the way to DC and get a hotel room just to see them?

371
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,030
Speaker 0: They might.

372
00:18:15,472 --> 00:18:16,370
Speaker 0: They're not that popular.

373
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:17,309
Speaker 1: We'll find out.

374
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:22,229
Speaker 1: I mean, there were a lot of people who were at that one Otacon just to see Larkon CL.

375
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,370
Speaker 0: Larkon CL is a lot bigger than machine supremacy.

376
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,169
Speaker 1: True, but how big are they in America?

377
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:30,209
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm not counting the crazy people who flew from Japan to see them here.

378
00:18:31,332 --> 00:18:32,550
Speaker 0: Anyway, we'll see.

379
00:18:33,092 --> 00:18:39,310
Speaker 1: But yeah, the only bad part of PAX, it was really sad, is the Omegathon finale for the first time.

380
00:18:39,431 --> 00:18:41,150
Speaker 0: I missed it for the first time.

381
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,190
Speaker 0: That's really sad.

382
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:47,550
Speaker 1: So it was great at first because it turned out it was Half-Life 1 ricochet.

383
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:49,190
Speaker 0: Sure.

384
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:51,989
Speaker 0: That would have been a great game for...

385
00:18:52,212 --> 00:18:52,847
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

386
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:57,650
Speaker 1: So Scott couldn't see the Omegathon finale because he was enforcing and I was enforcing.

387
00:18:57,731 --> 00:18:58,990
Speaker 1: but I was enforcing main theater.

388
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,348
Speaker 1: I was like doing security at the front of the room.

389
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:02,217
Speaker 0: So...

390
00:19:02,751 --> 00:19:14,721
Speaker 1: So I'm in there doing my thing, getting the crowd all situated, and our friend Ro walks up to me and says, "So I know that you're thinking, how are we gonna prank Scott because he's not

391
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:14,946
Speaker 1: here?".

392
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,347
Speaker 0: I even texted Ro, "Don't lie to

393
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:17,528
Speaker 0: me.".

394
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:23,261
Speaker 1: And I looked at her and said, "I've been trying to come up with the perfect game to lie to him for the last

395
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:23,665
Speaker 1: hour.".

396
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:30,367
Speaker 1: And then we collaborated and we agreed that we came up with many possible ideas and we threw them all out.

397
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,070
Speaker 0: But what were some of your ideas?

398
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:42,680
Speaker 1: So Ro's first idea was NS2 and I was like, "No, that'd be way too obvious.

399
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,332
Speaker 0: It'd be too

400
00:19:43,434 --> 00:19:43,598
Speaker 0: hard.".

401
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,380
Speaker 0: That couldn't be an Omegathon finale game.

402
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,279
Speaker 1: Unless they'd primed them and taught them how to play ahead of time and set up teams.

403
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,980
Speaker 0: That would have been so boring, not suspenseful, not exciting, too hard to play.

404
00:19:54,121 --> 00:19:55,480
Speaker 0: I would not believe that for a second.

405
00:19:57,443 --> 00:20:04,978
Speaker 1: And then we debated a little more and we tried to come up with some old NES game or something and Ro was like, "You know, Outlaw would be perfect, but it's only two

406
00:20:05,018 --> 00:20:05,360
Speaker 1: player.".

407
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:05,878
Speaker 0: That's right.

408
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,059
Speaker 1: And then eventually we realized...

409
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,240
Speaker 0: You could have easily fooled me at PAX Prime by saying Outlaw, easily.

410
00:20:12,501 --> 00:20:13,118
Speaker 0: I would believe that.

411
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,320
Speaker 0: In fact, that should be the PAX Prime Omegathon finale.

412
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,539
Speaker 1: You know, it'd be great if someday you're enforcing at Prime and you miss the Omegathon finale and it is Outlaw and then you don't believe us.

413
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,558
Speaker 0: Nah, then fuck me.

414
00:20:25,001 --> 00:20:28,698
Speaker 1: So eventually we realized that Half-Life 1 Ricochet is the best one because...

415
00:20:29,282 --> 00:20:30,500
Speaker 0: It did have a team mode.

416
00:20:30,845 --> 00:20:31,820
Speaker 1: It does have team mode.

417
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,880
Speaker 1: It's quick and easy to learn, easy to spectate.

418
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:43,320
Speaker 0: It would have been great for spectating with using HLTV as people were falling off to their desks and getting decapitated and getting the triple shot.

419
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:47,080
Speaker 1: It's the kind of game that someone with no experience could play very well.

420
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:54,720
Speaker 0: As long as you know how to control an FPS with the mouse and keyboard, basically, you can play that game because there's only two attack buttons and that's it.

421
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,318
Speaker 0: There's no jump.

422
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,719
Speaker 0: You just... You guess you can jump, but you don't want to.

423
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,520
Speaker 1: Players would learn together.

424
00:20:59,786 --> 00:21:00,460
Speaker 1: Everything would work out.

425
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,179
Speaker 1: It'd be a perfect game.

426
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:07,000
Speaker 1: Also, it's just weird enough to where it would be like the crazy Omegathon finale.

427
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,480
Speaker 1: And of course, Ricochet is very near and dear to me and Scott's hearts.

428
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,500
Speaker 0: It would make a great Omegathon finale at either Omegathon.

429
00:21:15,306 --> 00:21:16,260
Speaker 0: Just a straight up duel.

430
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,840
Speaker 0: They could do best of five or whatever and be awesome.

431
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:27,980
Speaker 1: So what we agreed to do, we coordinated this shit, is that we were going to text Scott simultaneously when they actually announced it.

432
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,179
Speaker 1: That way we would be in sync.

433
00:21:30,501 --> 00:21:31,198
Speaker 0: You were in sync.

434
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:40,940
Speaker 1: And then we each wanted to tweet or text or tweet at him a little bit later some details from the game to see how long we could keep it going.

435
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:47,919
Speaker 1: And I think my favorite moment was I texted you and I said, "Man, no one's gotten a head shot yet.

436
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,790
Speaker 1: Triple shot is

437
00:21:48,871 --> 00:21:49,235
Speaker 1: ruling.".

438
00:21:49,721 --> 00:21:51,393
Speaker 1: And you responded something like, "Well,

439
00:21:51,534 --> 00:21:52,078
Speaker 1: obviously.".

440
00:21:52,502 --> 00:21:53,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, right?

441
00:21:53,581 --> 00:22:01,000
Speaker 0: It takes less skill to hit someone with a triple shot, especially with the bouncing off the walls, that's going to get some hits from people who aren't paying attention in all directions.

442
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:08,319
Speaker 0: And if you've never played before, you probably don't know about the right-click chainsaw shot and it's hard to hit with even if you know how to use it.

443
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,100
Speaker 1: So I was very proud of the horrible prank we played on Scott.

444
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:19,620
Speaker 0: It fooled me for about a minute because the other enforcers in my area got correct information from other people.

445
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,057
Speaker 1: Well, it was a little longer than a minute because I have the timeline of the text to and from.

446
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,116
Speaker 0: It was a matter of minutes and I was just like...

447
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,420
Speaker 1: Minutes, but not minutes.

448
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,940
Speaker 0: And I was also not trusting.

449
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,372
Speaker 0: I was only like 75% fooled, not 100% fooled.

450
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:38,378
Speaker 0: If I was 100% fooled, why would I have been asking other enforcers to confirm, right?

451
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:39,940
Speaker 1: Maybe you weren't.

452
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,114
Speaker 1: Maybe you were just like, "Oh man,

453
00:22:41,175 --> 00:22:41,398
Speaker 1: ricochet.".

454
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:50,292
Speaker 0: It was indeed though very plausible and a very good choice, which is why I was like, "Oh, I'm going with it until I had to ask

455
00:22:50,313 --> 00:22:50,696
Speaker 0: somebody.".

456
00:22:51,465 --> 00:22:52,118
Speaker 1: I was proud of that.

457
00:22:52,822 --> 00:22:58,160
Speaker 1: We did our due diligence in pranking, but the actual omega-thon was Space Team.

458
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,440
Speaker 1: Now Space Team actually was a pretty good omega-thon, like it was a good idea.

459
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,196
Speaker 0: It could be, yeah.

460
00:23:05,262 --> 00:23:09,920
Speaker 1: When it worked, it was actually really funny to watch, especially the way they did it.

461
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,360
Speaker 0: How did they get the video on the screens?

462
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,800
Speaker 1: They had people holding HD cameras over everyone's heads like this.

463
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:16,540
Speaker 0: They didn't use the video out from iPhones?

464
00:23:17,148 --> 00:23:17,479
Speaker 1: Uh, no.

465
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,239
Speaker 0: That sucks.

466
00:23:18,681 --> 00:23:20,200
Speaker 1: They talked about different ways to do it.

467
00:23:21,002 --> 00:23:24,340
Speaker 0: If they're going to spend money, they could have gotten those particular Android phones.

468
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,160
Speaker 0: It's on Android, right?

469
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,860
Speaker 0: Or is it iPhone only?

470
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,820
Speaker 1: I think it's iPhone only.

471
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,060
Speaker 0: Well, iPhone, you could get the video out cable, right?

472
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,000
Speaker 1: That wouldn't have worked out so well.

473
00:23:31,281 --> 00:23:31,720
Speaker 0: You could get it.

474
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,197
Speaker 0: No, no.

475
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:43,818
Speaker 1: Seeing them actually touching the screens kind of matters to the drama and also seeing them doing the things like flip it over, turn, twist it around, all that stuff, shake it.

476
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:44,743
Speaker 0: Mmm.

477
00:23:45,744 --> 00:23:45,871
Speaker 1: Mmm.

478
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:53,400
Speaker 1: So they had HD cameras like over everyone's shoulders and the two omega knots had to pick teammates from the Penny Arcade crew.

479
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,499
Speaker 0: See, I'm not a fan of this.

480
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,349
Speaker 0: This is scenes who have been happening in recent.

481
00:23:56,409 --> 00:24:00,719
Speaker 0: omega thons where, you know, it's the omega thon at PAX East is two versus two.

482
00:24:01,301 --> 00:24:03,040
Speaker 0: Find a game that's two versus two.

483
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:10,660
Speaker 0: If it's four versus four and you've got to like pick people for your team now, whether you go to Germany or not, it doesn't lie solely in your and your partner's hands.

484
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,134
Speaker 0: It lies in the hands of these other people that don't get to.

485
00:24:13,336 --> 00:24:15,699
Speaker 0: don't care because they don't get to go to Germany if they win or lose.

486
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,378
Speaker 0: I mean, now they're not going to try to win.

487
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,070
Speaker 0: But still, it should it should always be.

488
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:23,300
Speaker 0: if you want to make it two versus two, make it a two versus two game.

489
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:23,920
Speaker 0: End of story.

490
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:25,000
Speaker 1: Now, see, I disagree.

491
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,360
Speaker 0: Crokinole was so perfect.

492
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:31,660
Speaker 1: I disagree because the primary purpose of the omega seems to be to entertain the crowd.

493
00:24:32,522 --> 00:24:34,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, that is definitely very important to the omega.

494
00:24:35,201 --> 00:24:36,880
Speaker 0: The game must entertain the crowd.

495
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:42,678
Speaker 0: However, also, you cannot forget that those people up there are battling for a significant prize.

496
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:43,175
Speaker 0: Yeah.

497
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,920
Speaker 1: But at the same time, what's funny is that I see well.

498
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:50,940
Speaker 1: So I was actually at the Jenga, the pre-Omegathon finale, and that was great to watch.

499
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:51,820
Speaker 0: They've done that before.

500
00:24:52,001 --> 00:24:52,780
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's always every year.

501
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,600
Speaker 1: They seem to add a complication like this year.

502
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,699
Speaker 1: They taped the people together in these really awkward ways and then made him do it.

503
00:24:59,421 --> 00:25:04,298
Speaker 1: And it got to the point where one of the teams like they were stuck, they touched a piece of the head to pull it.

504
00:25:04,662 --> 00:25:07,720
Speaker 1: But there is no way they could pull it without knocking the whole thing down.

505
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:11,399
Speaker 1: But they had unlimited time, so they kept going for it.

506
00:25:12,004 --> 00:25:13,098
Speaker 1: And they kept going for it.

507
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,978
Speaker 1: And he's like, "Wika, Wika, Wika, Wika, Wika, Wika, Wika, Wika, Wika,

508
00:25:17,998 --> 00:25:18,219
Speaker 1: Wika.".

509
00:25:18,722 --> 00:25:20,420
Speaker 1: This goes on for several minutes.

510
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,060
Speaker 0: This is the giant Jenga set, too, right?

511
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:22,797
Speaker 0: Giant Jenga.

512
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,900
Speaker 1: And Mike's like, "Come on, you can do it.

513
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,609
Speaker 1: The crowd's with

514
00:25:25,629 --> 00:25:25,751
Speaker 1: you.".

515
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,899
Speaker 1: And then as it keeps going on, eventually the crowd...

516
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:42,220
Speaker 0: If I touched a piece that I knew is impossible to remove from the Jenga, but was therefore forced to remove that piece, losing the Jenga, instead of trying to remove the piece, well, first I would give it a minimum effort to see if there was maybe a possibility.

517
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:42,760
Speaker 0: Rage quit?

518
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:49,080
Speaker 0: As soon as there was no possibility, I would just like jump into the Jenga or kick it or dive in first into it.

519
00:25:49,241 --> 00:25:50,659
Speaker 1: I've never seen the Jengas until now.

520
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:55,120
Speaker 1: There's a long tradition of the losing team being one who actually does exactly that.

521
00:25:55,864 --> 00:25:56,560
Speaker 1: Losing style.

522
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:57,954
Speaker 1: But no, they went for it.

523
00:25:59,080 --> 00:25:59,695
Speaker 0: Body check it.

524
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:05,008
Speaker 1: They started losing the crowd, and at one point, the crowd just starts chanting, "Physics, physics,

525
00:26:05,292 --> 00:26:05,819
Speaker 1: physics."

526
00:26:06,061 --> 00:26:09,460
Speaker 1: And then they started stomping their feet to try to make it just fall on its own.

527
00:26:10,866 --> 00:26:11,539
Speaker 1: It was pretty great.

528
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,680
Speaker 0: That's pretty great.

529
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:17,318
Speaker 1: A bunch of people in the audience coordinated and went, "One, two, three," and all jumped at the same time.

530
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:17,813
Speaker 1: Yeah.

531
00:26:19,381 --> 00:26:25,499
Speaker 0: They should do that not just to get those people to lose, but they should do that when the winners are up there doing their normal Jenga.

532
00:26:25,902 --> 00:26:26,520
Speaker 0: It's no good.

533
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,819
Speaker 0: Just everyone constantly jump up and down.

534
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,899
Speaker 1: That might be what happened during the Omegathon finale, for all we know.

535
00:26:32,145 --> 00:26:32,379
Speaker 1: Hey.

536
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,220
Speaker 1: Could just be a troller.

537
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:33,716
Speaker 0: Sure.

538
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:42,880
Speaker 1: But the funny part was Mike was pretty much on with the quips the entire time, and at one point, he's like, "You know, guys, you could just buy a ticket to Germany.

539
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:43,784
Speaker 1: Might be

540
00:26:43,805 --> 00:26:44,233
Speaker 1: faster.".

541
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:50,600
Speaker 0: See, those guys have been practicing that quipery for basically over a decade.

542
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,020
Speaker 1: Well, it shows now, like in Strip Search.

543
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,058
Speaker 0: Have you been watching Strip Search?

544
00:26:54,442 --> 00:26:55,020
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

545
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,838
Speaker 1: The thing is- Mike and Jerry, I salute you.

546
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:57,371
Speaker 0: Yeah.

547
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:03,360
Speaker 0: It's like artists, 30 minutes is less time than what you have.

548
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:03,893
Speaker 0: You have 40 minutes.

549
00:27:06,063 --> 00:27:14,323
Speaker 0: But it's like they come up with a joke like that, and that's Mike's favorite thing to do is come up with a clever joke and reuse that joke over and over again, maybe tweaking it slightly.

550
00:27:14,404 --> 00:27:17,520
Speaker 0: so, the mega time, mega tea, mega toe, over and over again.

551
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,336
Speaker 0: That's his favorite thing.

552
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,145
Speaker 0: There's even a podcast.

553
00:27:20,286 --> 00:27:34,380
Speaker 0: once, like a few years ago, where he did some word joke, and he did the word joke again with a different word, but it's the same joke, and he said, "I think, I remember, yeah, when I find a joke like that, I just latch onto it, and it's never unfunny.

554
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,445
Speaker 0: You just keep using it over and over

555
00:27:35,526 --> 00:27:35,908
Speaker 0: again.".

556
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:53,139
Speaker 1: So anyway, the Omegathon finale, Space Team, it was going to work out fine, and the first round went great, and then there were some network issues, and then there kept being network issues, and eventually, they just had to call it, and all the Omeganauts get to go to Germany.

557
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,238
Speaker 0: Who's going to pay for that?

558
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:55,380
Speaker 1: Penny Arcade?

559
00:27:55,828 --> 00:27:55,977
Speaker 0: Sure.

560
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:56,538
Speaker 1: They got money.

561
00:27:57,545 --> 00:27:57,760
Speaker 1: Okay.

562
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:11,480
Speaker 1: What's sad is that it was super exciting up to that point, like they finally got a good run in, like one team got all the way to like the sixth or eighth, I forget what zone they got to, and the game didn't crash, they died legit.

563
00:28:12,381 --> 00:28:16,719
Speaker 1: So the other team had to either get past them or it was over.

564
00:28:17,621 --> 00:28:25,819
Speaker 1: So the other team goes, and we're already at the end now, the other team gets to the same zone they were in, and then the game breaks.

565
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:35,640
Speaker 1: So you might think, and I thought this at first too, maybe they didn't test it fully.

566
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,180
Speaker 1: Maybe they didn't test it with everyone in the room.

567
00:28:37,661 --> 00:28:44,079
Speaker 1: I have verified with everyone who knows, they tested this more than any of us could have dreamed of testing it.

568
00:28:44,846 --> 00:28:45,498
Speaker 1: They tested it.

569
00:28:45,881 --> 00:28:46,640
Speaker 0: I just never tried.

570
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,040
Speaker 0: See, I wouldn't even bother testing it.

571
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,139
Speaker 0: I would have ruled it right out.

572
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,030
Speaker 0: No wifi, no internet needed for anything ever.

573
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:55,799
Speaker 0: in any event I do at a live thing ever, because it cannot be trusted.

574
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:59,460
Speaker 1: But they seriously, they tested it behind the stage.

575
00:28:59,841 --> 00:29:03,079
Speaker 1: Imagine how nervous they were, because they can't let anyone in on what it might be.

576
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:11,760
Speaker 1: I mean, it'd be suspicious if you see a bunch of people playing Space Team just all over the place who are on the PA staff behind the scenes.

577
00:29:13,302 --> 00:29:14,939
Speaker 1: But they tested it during the concerts.

578
00:29:15,382 --> 00:29:22,719
Speaker 1: They tested it apparently on stage when the crowd was already in for the omega-thon, like 10 minutes before go-live, and everything was fine.

579
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,318
Speaker 1: It only failed in the actual omega-thon.

580
00:29:26,841 --> 00:29:32,200
Speaker 1: Even after they asked people, and Coop was like, "Yeah, this is ghetto, I know, but whatever," to go into airplane mode.

581
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:32,939
Speaker 1: It still didn't help.

582
00:29:33,368 --> 00:29:33,458
Speaker 0: Nope.

583
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,178
Speaker 0: Who knows what that was causing it?

584
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:35,753
Speaker 1: Yeah.

585
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:39,800
Speaker 1: It's some sort of wifi disturbance of some kind.

586
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,579
Speaker 1: It's hard to tell.

587
00:29:41,722 --> 00:29:43,537
Speaker 0: Some people I heard were saying, "Why didn't you use

588
00:29:43,577 --> 00:29:43,960
Speaker 0: Bluetooth?".

589
00:29:44,463 --> 00:29:46,839
Speaker 0: That was apparently an alternative that might have worked.

590
00:29:47,863 --> 00:29:51,780
Speaker 1: From what I've been told, that was considered and not viable.

591
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:52,267
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

592
00:29:52,822 --> 00:29:53,092
Speaker 0: I don't know.

593
00:29:54,282 --> 00:29:55,840
Speaker 0: All I'm saying is, I would never do anything.

594
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,320
Speaker 0: I wouldn't even bother being like, "Testing the wifi, it works.

595
00:29:58,461 --> 00:29:58,977
Speaker 0: Okay, let's do

596
00:29:59,019 --> 00:29:59,060
Speaker 0: it.".

597
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,758
Speaker 0: I would be like, "No.

598
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,180
Speaker 0: We are never going to do anything that requires wifi or internet, because we cannot trust

599
00:30:04,283 --> 00:30:04,345
Speaker 0: it.".

600
00:30:04,921 --> 00:30:05,419
Speaker 0: End of story.

601
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:18,209
Speaker 0: Maybe if I had a dedicated internet line coming in, like a T1 that I rented and tested and had ethernet cables going to it, and I was visiting web pages on it, I'm like, "Okay, we can use

602
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:18,413
Speaker 0: this.".

603
00:30:19,705 --> 00:30:20,820
Speaker 1: I would trust internet just fine.

604
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:24,460
Speaker 1: What I do is cut off attendee access to the internet before.

605
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:27,540
Speaker 0: I would trust a wired LAN game as well, obviously.

606
00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:28,739
Speaker 0: That's fine.

607
00:30:34,002 --> 00:30:35,560
Speaker 1: Anyway, things of the day.

608
00:30:37,161 --> 00:30:40,360
Speaker 0: You've seen a lot of performances on the internet of music.

609
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,719
Speaker 0: This is not a new thing.

610
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,659
Speaker 0: It is super old.

611
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,461
Speaker 0: In fact, this particular video is from 2010.

612
00:30:45,461 --> 00:30:49,800
Speaker 0: I just didn't see it until today, because, well, not even today, like a couple days ago.

613
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,600
Speaker 0: What this is, is a guy named James Hill.

614
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,700
Speaker 0: The video was uploaded by Gordon Mayer on YouTube.

615
00:30:56,462 --> 00:30:59,380
Speaker 0: This is at the Dusty Springs Seattle Uke Fest.

616
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,530
Speaker 0: He's playing a uke, a lele, ukulele.

617
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:06,760
Speaker 0: He is playing the song "Billie Jean" by Michael Jackson.

618
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:17,420
Speaker 0: The way this guy plays this ukulele, it is like he is playing five or six instruments simultaneously, even though it's only one instrument.

619
00:31:17,945 --> 00:31:18,940
Speaker 0: It is pretty impressive.

620
00:31:19,643 --> 00:31:20,270
Speaker 0: It's worth seeing.

621
00:31:20,331 --> 00:31:20,999
Speaker 0: if you haven't seen it.

622
00:31:21,481 --> 00:31:28,179
Speaker 0: It's probably, even I, who have seen almost everything on the internet, in reality, I've only probably seen 90% of things on the internet.

623
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:32,460
Speaker 0: This is one of those 10% of things that comes around again.

624
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:36,834
Speaker 0: It's like I'm seeing it for the first time when everyone else has seen it for the second time.

625
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:43,737
Speaker 0: But whatever, now you can remove this from your 10% and move up to 91% of internet being seen.

626
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:48,540
Speaker 1: So this, what I have for you, my thing of the day, winter's over.

627
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,179
Speaker 1: It's a winter wrap up, if you will.

628
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,880
Speaker 1: This is a fan made, sort of stop motion, live action.

629
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,879
Speaker 0: It's not stop motion, it's live motion.

630
00:31:59,104 --> 00:32:02,300
Speaker 1: You can argue that it's just incredibly high frame rate stop motion.

631
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:02,978
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

632
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,638
Speaker 0: It's regular videoing.

633
00:32:05,781 --> 00:32:14,459
Speaker 1: This is a highly accurate representation of the winter wrap up scene from My Little Pony, done with real life models.

634
00:32:15,201 --> 00:32:18,580
Speaker 1: And it's just extremely well done and very charming to watch.

635
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:20,519
Speaker 0: It's charming, I'll give you that.

636
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,327
Speaker 1: There's something, it warmed the cockles of my heart, or maybe that's my fever coming back.

637
00:32:25,821 --> 00:32:28,359
Speaker 0: It does have three quarters of a million views, almost.

638
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, that says something.

639
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,119
Speaker 0: It says something, all right.

640
00:32:33,543 --> 00:32:34,180
Speaker 0: Bargo, bargo.

641
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,976
Speaker 1: In the meta moment, the book club book, which you still haven't put on the website is...

642
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:40,420
Speaker 0: Oh, I will do that when I get home.

643
00:32:40,782 --> 00:32:44,800
Speaker 0: It is The Player of Games by Iain M. Banks.

644
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:48,179
Speaker 0: It is the most geek nights a book can possibly be.

645
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:55,500
Speaker 0: I started reading it and then I haven't read it again in a little while because of PAX and stuff, but I'm going to continue reading it very soon.

646
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,959
Speaker 0: I think Emily's actually read more than either of us.

647
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:01,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, because she borrowed my Kindle and she's been reading it, so I gotta borrow it back.

648
00:33:02,141 --> 00:33:03,140
Speaker 0: I thought she had her own Kindle.

649
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:06,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I bought the book, I can't just give it to her.

650
00:33:07,102 --> 00:33:08,059
Speaker 0: Oh, you bought it?

651
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,460
Speaker 0: See, this is why I don't buy Kindle books ever with the DRMs.

652
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:14,840
Speaker 1: We both buy books, but then we just trade Kindles periodically.

653
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever.

654
00:33:16,951 --> 00:33:17,120
Speaker 0: Anyway.

655
00:33:17,364 --> 00:33:17,659
Speaker 1: I don't know.

656
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,819
Speaker 1: I don't pirate everything because I got money.

657
00:33:20,381 --> 00:33:22,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got money too, but I'm still not going to buy a DRM book.

658
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,299
Speaker 0: If they were selling a DRM free book, I'd probably buy that.

659
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,487
Speaker 1: So you wouldn't buy a DRM book for like $2?

660
00:33:28,487 --> 00:33:28,677
Speaker 0: No.

661
00:33:30,201 --> 00:33:32,740
Speaker 1: But you'd pay, how much would you pay for the paperback of that book?

662
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,620
Speaker 0: Whatever it costs on Amazon.

663
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:35,879
Speaker 1: What if it was like 20 bucks?

664
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,578
Speaker 0: No, I probably wouldn't just buy it at all then.

665
00:33:40,162 --> 00:33:41,899
Speaker 0: I'm not going to pay 20 bucks for a paperback, you crazy.

666
00:33:43,542 --> 00:33:45,680
Speaker 0: I'm paying the reasonable paperback price.

667
00:33:47,161 --> 00:33:50,020
Speaker 1: But yeah, our next conventions are Kinetic Con.

668
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:50,840
Speaker 0: Anime Boston.

669
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:51,899
Speaker 1: And Anime Boston.

670
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:52,231
Speaker 0: In May.

671
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:56,800
Speaker 0: This weekend is the Mocha Festival in New York City.

672
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,079
Speaker 0: You should go to that.

673
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,840
Speaker 1: We'll be there Saturday hanging out, looking at comics, buying comics.

674
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,838
Speaker 1: I think I spend more money at Mocha than any other convention I ever go to.

675
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,779
Speaker 0: It doesn't say anything I want to buy, really, except PAX t-shirts at PAX.

676
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,580
Speaker 1: I guess I'll spend more getting to PAXOS, but that's a different expense altogether.

677
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:14,539
Speaker 0: It's a different situation, right.

678
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,398
Speaker 0: Kinetic Con.

679
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,099
Speaker 0: Spend more on food at Anime Boston.

680
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:28,578
Speaker 1: And Kinetic Con, we're basically in the process of scheduling the con, but if you haven't submitted a panel yet and you really want to submit, and your submission's really, really good, you might still make it in.

681
00:34:29,161 --> 00:34:33,699
Speaker 1: In particular, we got fewer anime submissions than we've ever gotten.

682
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:38,539
Speaker 0: So if you submit a crappy anime panel, it's actually likely to get accepted because we need anime.

683
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,020
Speaker 0: It's a multi-genre convention.

684
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:46,078
Speaker 0: We want to give time to all genres roughly, equally, or fairly.

685
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:55,179
Speaker 0: So any genres that are underrepresented or medias or geekeries that are underrepresented are more likely to get their panels accepted.

686
00:34:55,460 --> 00:35:01,459
Speaker 1: What's interesting, though, is that for three years now, the number of anime panels submitted has dropped precipitously every year.

687
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,560
Speaker 0: And we keep trying to solicit people to come do some panels, Mike Tool.

688
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:05,935
Speaker 0: But they don't.

689
00:35:06,601 --> 00:35:09,200
Speaker 1: And the trend, it amazed me the trend has continued.

690
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:14,760
Speaker 1: So I am now not surprised when certain people I know at Anime Cons are complaining that they don't get any panel submissions.

691
00:35:15,301 --> 00:35:18,680
Speaker 1: There might just be a drying up in general of Anime Con content.

692
00:35:19,506 --> 00:35:19,916
Speaker 0: There may be.

693
00:35:20,321 --> 00:35:20,839
Speaker 1: It's hard to say.

694
00:35:21,464 --> 00:35:21,675
Speaker 0: Maybe.

695
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:30,460
Speaker 0: There's not much left to say about anime, or the people who have things to say don't have things to say about anime, or the people who have things to say about anime are few and far between.

696
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,799
Speaker 1: I mean, we're doing five.

697
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,680
Speaker 0: Or they've already said everything they had to say and there's not really much new to say.

698
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,920
Speaker 1: We're doing five panels in Anime Boston.

699
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,439
Speaker 1: We could have done more, but we didn't want to.

700
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,031
Speaker 0: Yeah.

701
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,177
Speaker 0: No, I don't want to do more than that.

702
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,420
Speaker 0: We still got to do the really hard one, though.

703
00:35:42,822 --> 00:35:42,908
Speaker 0: Yeah.

704
00:35:43,281 --> 00:35:45,600
Speaker 1: Let's start on that before July.

705
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,940
Speaker 0: Let's divide up the, before July, the cons in May.

706
00:35:51,701 --> 00:35:55,313
Speaker 1: But anyway, at PAX, we played a game that looked like.

707
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:57,400
Speaker 1: I looked at it and it looked amazing.

708
00:35:57,521 --> 00:36:00,820
Speaker 1: It looked like exactly the kind of game that is totally my jam.

709
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:04,700
Speaker 1: A bunch of our friends were playing it and they all said, "This game is great.

710
00:36:05,061 --> 00:36:05,798
Speaker 1: You've got to play

711
00:36:05,819 --> 00:36:05,860
Speaker 1: it."

712
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:12,200
Speaker 1: Including some of them who are not known for their love of complicated, boring German games.

713
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,159
Speaker 0: So I played this game, actually.

714
00:36:14,862 --> 00:36:17,340
Speaker 0: I don't think Rin was playing the time I was playing, right?

715
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:22,680
Speaker 1: I played in one game that didn't finish after you already knew something about the game.

716
00:36:23,081 --> 00:36:28,760
Speaker 1: And then I played another game of it the next day with only fast people that also did not finish.

717
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,540
Speaker 0: Basically, let's just get to the point, right?

718
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,460
Speaker 0: I played this game and we didn't finish, but I thought that we didn't finish because some of the people we're playing with were new.

719
00:36:35,681 --> 00:36:37,019
Speaker 0: I was actually new to it as well.

720
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,120
Speaker 0: He's new to this game, even though I was playing quickly.

721
00:36:39,724 --> 00:36:40,680
Speaker 0: And they were playing slowly.

722
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,800
Speaker 0: So I was like, "All right, we're just going to end this now because it's too late.

723
00:36:44,241 --> 00:36:47,798
Speaker 0: We'll play this again another time with only fast people and it'll be

724
00:36:47,918 --> 00:36:48,200
Speaker 0: awesome.".

725
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,680
Speaker 0: Because so far, everything in this game is super fun and awesome.

726
00:36:51,421 --> 00:36:54,100
Speaker 0: So then we came back and it was the day after PAX.

727
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,379
Speaker 0: Only awesome people were left.

728
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,160
Speaker 0: People were fast and awesome at board games.

729
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,959
Speaker 0: We played this game and it took for fucking ever.

730
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,240
Speaker 0: This game is so goddamn slow, even though it's fun.

731
00:37:04,761 --> 00:37:09,867
Speaker 1: I literally, in my opinion of this game, went from, "This is going to be one of my favorite board

732
00:37:09,908 --> 00:37:10,174
Speaker 1: games.".

733
00:37:10,682 --> 00:37:12,660
Speaker 0: You said you were going to go home and buy it.

734
00:37:12,901 --> 00:37:14,780
Speaker 1: I almost bought it that night.

735
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,619
Speaker 1: I just fell asleep before I remembered to in the hotel room.

736
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:20,400
Speaker 1: I'm so glad I didn't buy this game.

737
00:37:20,524 --> 00:37:20,919
Speaker 0: So glad.

738
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,860
Speaker 0: So really, the game is called Ground Floor.

739
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,718
Speaker 0: Did we mention that already?

740
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:30,760
Speaker 1: Ground Floor is a game that is a pseudo-simulation of a company growing.

741
00:37:31,381 --> 00:37:40,039
Speaker 1: And you'll add floors to your building and specialize out your building and hire workers and then distribute those workers around the board doing stuff for you.

742
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:46,344
Speaker 1: Not in a normal, traditional worker placement way, but more like you have an abstraction of.

743
00:37:46,446 --> 00:37:47,380
Speaker 1: you add an employee.

744
00:37:47,782 --> 00:37:52,100
Speaker 1: An employee has three time markers that designate what they're doing with their time.

745
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:52,700
Speaker 0: Yeah.

746
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:57,640
Speaker 0: So you spend these time markers to choose all around the board and all the different places.

747
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:03,039
Speaker 0: And each different place on the board that you can put workers is basically like a game in and of itself.

748
00:38:03,241 --> 00:38:17,040
Speaker 0: So it's like on this big board, there's a bunch of little tiny games and you can buy in to play those games by spending your two different currencies, the money and the information currencies and your time markers into those games to play them.

749
00:38:17,502 --> 00:38:21,851
Speaker 0: And of course, if you play and do well at those games, you get more resources out of them.

750
00:38:22,282 --> 00:38:34,920
Speaker 0: And the only game that really matters is the final game on the board, which is the construction game, which allows you to build new floors in your building and new windows for your building so that you can get victory points.

751
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:41,200
Speaker 0: You can also get victory points by upgrading things on your own card to make your games more efficient.

752
00:38:41,281 --> 00:38:42,399
Speaker 0: But that's pretty minor.

753
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:52,599
Speaker 0: It's really all about playing a bunch of tiny games with your little pieces in order to get resources to get, you know, victory points in the last the construction game.

754
00:38:54,142 --> 00:39:05,660
Speaker 1: So now it's interesting that the game has so many structures, yet actual victory points are relatively few and far between and are really only in this sort of construction phase.

755
00:39:06,081 --> 00:39:10,960
Speaker 1: Like adding floors and adding improvements to your building gets you a few victory points.

756
00:39:11,541 --> 00:39:19,940
Speaker 0: It also makes it easier to get more victory points because those added floors to your building give you vast powers, powers greater than any other power available in the game.

757
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:28,920
Speaker 1: But that there's such complexity in the game before that point and so little complexity there at the end was kind of surprising.

758
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,100
Speaker 1: It wasn't what I usually expect from games.

759
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:42,040
Speaker 0: Well, I think the reason the complexity drains out of the game is because as you get those improvements to your building, you actually can now ignore some of the other games.

760
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:42,521
Speaker 0: Right.

761
00:39:42,541 --> 00:39:48,599
Speaker 0: So if you were to get, say, in the third phase of the game, the accounting floor, which I really wanted, but we didn't get to the third phase goes too long.

762
00:39:49,162 --> 00:39:51,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, we didn't even get to the third phase.

763
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:51,740
Speaker 0: Right.

764
00:39:51,760 --> 00:40:09,380
Speaker 0: You can use that accounting floor to just get cash money, which means you can now ignore pretty much the factory retail part of the game, which is usually the best way to get cash because you now have your own supply of cash that all you do is just spend some workers and get cash directly.

765
00:40:09,925 --> 00:40:10,759
Speaker 0: So screw that.

766
00:40:11,081 --> 00:40:11,302
Speaker 0: All right.

767
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:16,979
Speaker 0: There is also other things that like get you add information to your income so you can get tons of folders all the time.

768
00:40:17,482 --> 00:40:24,419
Speaker 0: You can now if you get that, you can now ignore the folder getting game, except when it's really obvious and easy to get a ton of folders out of it.

769
00:40:24,961 --> 00:40:36,658
Speaker 0: So in that later game, you're pretty much just rushing to construct very quickly and ignoring most of the other bits, except for the marketing bit, which you can't ignore at all the whole game.

770
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:42,465
Speaker 1: Now, the way the game works fundamentally is you've got your little board with, you know, your building on it.

771
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:44,320
Speaker 1: It's got this cute little thing as you add floors.

772
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:53,840
Speaker 1: They like rise up out of the top of your board, like the production values are super high quality, but you'll have your CEO and you choose to hire or not hire employees.

773
00:40:54,361 --> 00:40:58,360
Speaker 1: And the cost of hiring depends on the current economy and how many other people hired.

774
00:40:58,882 --> 00:41:04,622
Speaker 1: And that's a trend in the entire game that things you do depend heavily on who did it before you.

775
00:41:05,827 --> 00:41:11,080
Speaker 1: Sometimes it's affected by who does it after you and is affected by the economy, which has its own sort.

776
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,880
Speaker 1: It's like a weather in the game that changes like it's a recession.

777
00:41:14,262 --> 00:41:14,989
Speaker 1: Now it's stable.

778
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,200
Speaker 1: Boom times, depression.

779
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,005
Speaker 1: It jumps around.

780
00:41:17,127 --> 00:41:18,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you can always see what's coming.

781
00:41:18,801 --> 00:41:21,280
Speaker 0: So it's not like you can get surprised and screwed by luck.

782
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:24,140
Speaker 1: It's like you only see a little bit into the future.

783
00:41:24,301 --> 00:41:28,860
Speaker 0: You can see one into the future, which is pretty much enough to plan a turn ahead.

784
00:41:28,981 --> 00:41:29,164
Speaker 0: Right.

785
00:41:29,184 --> 00:41:30,439
Speaker 0: Which is all you really need the plan.

786
00:41:30,561 --> 00:41:30,723
Speaker 0: Right.

787
00:41:30,743 --> 00:41:32,400
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, next year is going to be recession.

788
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,345
Speaker 0: Money is going to be tight.

789
00:41:33,727 --> 00:41:35,739
Speaker 0: Get money now during the boom times.

790
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:47,160
Speaker 1: So the problem with this game and I want to talk about the problems rather than getting into more detail about how to play, because the rules are very difficult to follow.

791
00:41:48,242 --> 00:41:50,220
Speaker 1: We were taught to play by one group of people.

792
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:57,279
Speaker 1: And as a result, we messed up like four different parts of the game because they didn't understand that part of the rules.

793
00:41:57,861 --> 00:41:58,022
Speaker 1: Yeah.

794
00:41:58,042 --> 00:42:03,840
Speaker 1: Rereading the rules and playing again, those parts of the game were still messed up, but in different ways.

795
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,346
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like I read.

796
00:42:05,426 --> 00:42:09,704
Speaker 0: I reread the rules to how to play the marketing game like three or four times.

797
00:42:09,805 --> 00:42:19,640
Speaker 0: And I read something different each time because different parts of the rule book, the rules for it were spread out over different parts instead of all concentrated in one, you know, direct area.

798
00:42:20,301 --> 00:42:27,160
Speaker 0: And the flow was way out of whack and we got it wrong a bunch of different ways, a bunch of different times before getting it right.

799
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:27,800
Speaker 1: Yeah.

800
00:42:27,841 --> 00:42:38,298
Speaker 1: The fact that we couldn't get the rules straight in repeated play and repeated rereadings of the rules bothered me because I cannot think of a game that has given us that much trouble that we didn't just out of hand dismiss.

801
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,259
Speaker 0: And just remember, this is all pros playing this game.

802
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,480
Speaker 1: Hellas was the last game where I had this level of rules.

803
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,780
Speaker 0: Well, the problem with Hellas is that the rules were just wrong, right?

804
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,140
Speaker 0: They were just the rules didn't fully explain themselves.

805
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,480
Speaker 0: You had to go get a rat online or something to explain it.

806
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,740
Speaker 1: But this game theoretically resolvable.

807
00:42:54,881 --> 00:43:03,060
Speaker 1: But the fact that all of us smart, super gamer people are reading the rules together over and over again had trouble agreeing on what the rules.

808
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like the rules did have everything written down in there somewhere.

809
00:43:06,401 --> 00:43:20,657
Speaker 0: But every time we reread it, we found something different that re-explained or, you know, we know we actually were doing that wrong and we're doing a little more right this time, but we're doing it's like because the main problem is you do things in different orders and the order matters a lot.

810
00:43:21,342 --> 00:43:23,820
Speaker 0: And sometimes the order it's just like popularity order.

811
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:28,200
Speaker 0: OK, but it also matters on like, well, the popularity just changed.

812
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,797
Speaker 0: So do we change the order now and do we do it in the order of this?

813
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:41,839
Speaker 0: You know, do we do broadcast, then print, then networking, or do we do, you know, this person in all three and then this person in all three?

814
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,559
Speaker 1: Now, this is the crux of the problem.

815
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:48,260
Speaker 1: It wouldn't be so bad if it were just that the rules were confusing, but the game was fine.

816
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:56,960
Speaker 1: The problem lies in the fact that while the rules are confusing, the actual mechanics the rules are describing are extremely nonintuitive.

817
00:43:58,221 --> 00:44:02,780
Speaker 1: As a result, if you try to intuit how it should go, you're going to get it wrong.

818
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:12,500
Speaker 1: But if you try to read the rules and figure it out, you're going to get a hell of a time getting it right, because it's hard to grok what the rules are saying because they don't match with what you'd expect.

819
00:44:12,904 --> 00:44:14,219
Speaker 0: I feel like this game could work.

820
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:18,933
Speaker 0: It's one of those ones where obviously it could work if it was a video game, because that makes everything faster, right?

821
00:44:20,061 --> 00:44:23,100
Speaker 0: But even then, it's just, it's not a fast game.

822
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,620
Speaker 0: Every round, you've got to do all this stuff, right?

823
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,200
Speaker 0: It took us like two hours to get halfway through the game.

824
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:33,260
Speaker 0: It's going to be like a four hour motherfucker with, you know, even people playing on a computer.

825
00:44:33,382 --> 00:44:34,500
Speaker 0: Maybe it's gonna be three hours.

826
00:44:34,861 --> 00:44:36,580
Speaker 0: You can just play clips instead, right?

827
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:40,344
Speaker 1: As I was going to say, Buttroom and Scott, you play four and five hour games all the time.

828
00:44:40,365 --> 00:44:41,320
Speaker 1: and yes, that is true.

829
00:44:41,641 --> 00:44:49,420
Speaker 1: But in a game of Eclipse, my brain is engaged the entire time and I feel this deep sense of satisfaction about the decisions I'm making.

830
00:44:49,520 --> 00:45:04,554
Speaker 1: In this game, I was never satisfied with the decision I was making because I had almost no directional heuristic whatsoever to tell me if what I was doing was going to help me win and if not, what I could do differently.

831
00:45:04,594 --> 00:45:05,400
Speaker 1: that would be better.

832
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,880
Speaker 0: It's like when you play Eclipse for four hours, you're getting your four hours worth.

833
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,800
Speaker 0: If your four hours is packed with Eclipse, you know, it's a full meal the whole time.

834
00:45:13,521 --> 00:45:17,800
Speaker 0: This is like eating snacks for four hours, you know, waiting for dinner.

835
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,198
Speaker 0: It's like, dude, I could have just eaten this.

836
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:26,660
Speaker 0: You know, this is, it feels like a lighter game than it is, you know, the mechanically, it feels like a Euro game, you know, more like a Puerto Rico.

837
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:34,460
Speaker 0: It should take 90 minutes, but it just drags and drags and, but you're not doing enough stuff that it feels like it should be that long.

838
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:44,580
Speaker 0: So very unsatisfying, even though I guess, you know, mechanically speaking, if you follow the rules and you're willing to sit there for that long, it's not really that bad.

839
00:45:44,965 --> 00:45:45,698
Speaker 0: It's actually pretty good.

840
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,580
Speaker 1: Now I worry that it is still bad.

841
00:45:49,022 --> 00:46:03,638
Speaker 1: And my, the reason I worry that it's bad is that having played through it and tried to figure it out, I realized that most of the game is not very complex and the decisions are usually pretty obvious and direct.

842
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:06,060
Speaker 0: There are many obvious decisions.

843
00:46:06,842 --> 00:46:08,818
Speaker 1: So what determines who's doing?

844
00:46:08,838 --> 00:46:09,080
Speaker 1: well?

845
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:15,458
Speaker 1: It seems to come down to the advertising agency and the quote unquote popularity metric in the game.

846
00:46:15,962 --> 00:46:18,340
Speaker 1: And this is where the game just fails me.

847
00:46:18,501 --> 00:46:20,078
Speaker 0: It's also the part where the rules are fucked up.

848
00:46:20,781 --> 00:46:25,600
Speaker 1: That the metric there has the same problem that that Viva Java game had.

849
00:46:26,061 --> 00:46:30,360
Speaker 1: In fact, I would say that this game and Viva Java share many of the same problems.

850
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:40,420
Speaker 1: This game uses a mechanic where you have a, a slider, a metric of popularity, and you put your little color token on it to show you how popular you are.

851
00:46:40,961 --> 00:46:43,940
Speaker 1: And you'll move up by moving your token steps to the right.

852
00:46:45,882 --> 00:46:51,600
Speaker 1: But because this is not granular enough, you'll almost always end up being on top of other people.

853
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:55,340
Speaker 1: There'll be three or four players stacked on one spot at any given time.

854
00:46:56,281 --> 00:47:02,140
Speaker 1: The precedent's order of how that tie is resolved is confusing, counterintuitive.

855
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:06,439
Speaker 1: I would argue the opposite of what I would expect from historical games.

856
00:47:07,061 --> 00:47:08,840
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you can sort of understand, right?

857
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:12,298
Speaker 0: Let's say we're both at popularity one and you're on top of me.

858
00:47:12,801 --> 00:47:14,719
Speaker 0: You're more popular because you're on top of me.

859
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:16,720
Speaker 1: That makes sense on an intuitive level.

860
00:47:17,221 --> 00:47:19,480
Speaker 0: So you gain three popularity, right?

861
00:47:19,882 --> 00:47:21,119
Speaker 0: Then I gained three.

862
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:26,977
Speaker 0: Well, you would think on the one hand, you gain the popularity first, which means you're better than me.

863
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:27,209
Speaker 0: Right.

864
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,219
Speaker 0: Therefore, you should be more popular than me.

865
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:34,440
Speaker 0: But because I moved second physically, my token is now on top of yours.

866
00:47:34,941 --> 00:47:45,080
Speaker 0: And now I'm more popular, which makes sense in a different way in that, you know, someone who's catching up, you know, it's a slight, you know, uh, you know, we know there's no catch up mechanism, right?

867
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,460
Speaker 0: But it's, it's a slight catch up kind of thing.

868
00:47:47,561 --> 00:47:54,860
Speaker 1: Like, you know, the guy who got away first, the catch up mechanism and that it narrows the playing field between, you know, percentage chance of victory and failure.

869
00:47:55,300 --> 00:48:00,679
Speaker 0: You got the benefit of going ahead first because you went ahead first, whereas I'm coming up from behind.

870
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:06,015
Speaker 0: So now you have to, you know, use that benefit you got from going early to keep getting away from me.

871
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,599
Speaker 1: But game designers take note.

872
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:18,000
Speaker 1: That just becomes an extremely annoying heuristic for people to actually deal with if they're trying to win your game, because it's very counterintuitive in practice.

873
00:48:18,221 --> 00:48:27,179
Speaker 1: Never use the mechanic of getting to the point second makes you the winner of the tie to as a catch up mechanism.

874
00:48:27,741 --> 00:48:28,419
Speaker 1: Never do that.

875
00:48:28,761 --> 00:48:34,499
Speaker 1: I've decided having run into a few games that have done it only recently, I've never run into this before.

876
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,900
Speaker 1: It's only, it only seems like these recent games.

877
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:42,618
Speaker 0: I think a better idea would have been to have the popularity just be, you know, popularity points.

878
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:43,160
Speaker 0: Right.

879
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:46,680
Speaker 0: And people would just have these points and, you know, it'd be some number.

880
00:48:47,363 --> 00:48:50,477
Speaker 0: And, you know, instead of having a scale from like, what does the scale go?

881
00:48:50,497 --> 00:48:53,600
Speaker 0: from like one to ten or something only goes up to nine.

882
00:48:53,684 --> 00:48:53,938
Speaker 1: Yeah.

883
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:54,558
Speaker 0: Have it.

884
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,280
Speaker 0: Let it be just from zero to a lot like zero to one hundred.

885
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:01,539
Speaker 0: So everyone has like a, you know, a very, you know, a much more granular scale.

886
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:03,860
Speaker 1: This and Viva Java both had that problem.

887
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:11,279
Speaker 1: The pot, the scale they use for this mechanism of determining who gets to go first in different areas is just not granular enough.

888
00:49:11,941 --> 00:49:15,000
Speaker 0: Or in another way you could think about it is that it's too granular.

889
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:19,080
Speaker 0: If you think about Kalis, the turn order, there's five players, there's five spots.

890
00:49:19,202 --> 00:49:20,220
Speaker 0: They're always in order.

891
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,360
Speaker 0: One, two, three, four, five.

892
00:49:21,464 --> 00:49:21,860
Speaker 0: Exactly.

893
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:24,099
Speaker 0: There's no one's on top of anyone or anything like that.

894
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:28,500
Speaker 0: There is a exact way to determine that order precisely.

895
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,059
Speaker 0: Power grid.

896
00:49:29,141 --> 00:49:29,960
Speaker 0: What's the turn order?

897
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:30,899
Speaker 0: There's this numbers.

898
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,620
Speaker 0: You just line up the people in specific order.

899
00:49:33,982 --> 00:49:35,699
Speaker 0: No one's tied in the turn order.

900
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:48,280
Speaker 1: So I think having read through this and just played the game, I think the reason that this advertising agency that determines your popularity is so confusing because we're just talking about the popularity points.

901
00:49:48,701 --> 00:49:50,780
Speaker 1: This is not all the bullshit around them.

902
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:54,900
Speaker 1: The fact that they decline and you lose popularity every turn.

903
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:02,439
Speaker 0: Remember, this is a game that has like seven tiny games in it and this popularity thing is just one of those games.

904
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,320
Speaker 1: Nevermind the fact that affects all the other games.

905
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:16,579
Speaker 1: Even getting popularity, you have to put guys onto this advertising agency and then populate them into one of three things that score popularity in a really extra doubly non-intuitive manner.

906
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:18,459
Speaker 0: It's like you got to put your guys in here.

907
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:22,080
Speaker 0: Then once they're in there in the holding area, then they can go into the actual game.

908
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:28,680
Speaker 1: But some abilities let you go right into one of these areas early, but then you lose a bonus and it gets complicated.

909
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,480
Speaker 0: But I think that that costs less resources.

910
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:38,259
Speaker 1: That complicated bullshit is all there to obfuscate the fact that the rest of the game is pretty brain dead.

911
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:38,839
Speaker 0: Yeah.

912
00:50:39,641 --> 00:50:43,720
Speaker 0: It's like when you're going in the factory, it's like the decision what to do in the factory is pretty simple.

913
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,830
Speaker 0: The warehouse is buy a box there.

914
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:49,739
Speaker 0: if it's the good way to get a box instead of using the assembly.

915
00:50:49,909 --> 00:50:50,059
Speaker 0: Right.

916
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:53,140
Speaker 1: And if it's too expensive, just buy the box from your own building instead.

917
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:58,786
Speaker 0: The folder game is pretty much just like if you need folders, you can get a whole bunch of them here if you know.

918
00:50:58,907 --> 00:51:02,200
Speaker 0: and you know, see if you're going to give that other person folders and whatever.

919
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:03,279
Speaker 1: It always fills up.

920
00:51:03,902 --> 00:51:06,771
Speaker 0: And the construction is get in there.

921
00:51:06,872 --> 00:51:14,579
Speaker 0: first, if you care about somebody taking a specific building you want to buy, if not, just get in there if you can afford it, because that's victory points.

922
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,900
Speaker 0: You want to get those as soon as possible.

923
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,980
Speaker 1: Don't worry about not getting in because you have like a thousand actions.

924
00:51:20,265 --> 00:51:20,495
Speaker 0: Yeah.

925
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,720
Speaker 0: It is like that's the real problem, right?

926
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:29,640
Speaker 0: Imagine if you're playing a curricula instead of having a five family members, each family member had like five units of work each day.

927
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:33,400
Speaker 0: So you had twenty five different workers and there were like 50 jobs.

928
00:51:34,442 --> 00:51:36,640
Speaker 0: And you could, you know, you put on your guys all different jobs.

929
00:51:36,821 --> 00:51:38,220
Speaker 0: That's why the game takes forever.

930
00:51:38,601 --> 00:51:42,620
Speaker 0: They really should have abstracted more of this stuff to make it less granular overall.

931
00:51:43,301 --> 00:51:48,739
Speaker 0: And I think you could have had a good game there because the simulation of company does sort of work out.

932
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:49,980
Speaker 1: Oh, the game was super fun.

933
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:50,699
Speaker 1: And this is the problem.

934
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:58,840
Speaker 1: The game is super fun in the first couple of turns until people have enough actions to actually use the advertising agency.

935
00:51:59,264 --> 00:52:00,780
Speaker 1: And then the game bogs down.

936
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:05,437
Speaker 0: And that's the other reason it bogs down is because advertising is the only thing you can really do for free.

937
00:52:06,001 --> 00:52:12,799
Speaker 0: So at the end of your turn, we have all these extra time markers, slash worker tokens, and you have nothing else to do with them.

938
00:52:13,302 --> 00:52:16,020
Speaker 0: You just dump them all in there for free, basically.

939
00:52:17,361 --> 00:52:24,080
Speaker 1: And you still got to follow the turn order and go around procedurally, because depending on what I do, other people might do something different.

940
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:28,700
Speaker 1: And it ends up being really unsatisfying.

941
00:52:29,253 --> 00:52:29,499
Speaker 0: Very.

942
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:36,620
Speaker 1: Now, I really think if you fix the advertising agency, there's no game there.

943
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:37,759
Speaker 1: And that's the problem.

944
00:52:38,401 --> 00:52:41,760
Speaker 0: Or what you could do is you could make the advertising agency the whole game.

945
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:42,882
Speaker 0: But the advertising

946
00:52:42,943 --> 00:53:05,420
Speaker 1: agency is super unfun because not only is it not intuitive and is the popularity game just non-granular and annoying and difficult to figure out, it also requires a large amount of procedural calculation on the place in the place of the players to figure out what to do with every one of their actions.

947
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:19,220
Speaker 0: And the thing is, most of the time I was calculating, actually not sure if this is something clever the game designers did or not, is I would be like, OK, if I put my guy into networking directly, I'll get this.

948
00:53:19,441 --> 00:53:23,139
Speaker 0: Well, if I pay this to get him into networking, then I'll get two guys in there.

949
00:53:23,521 --> 00:53:29,220
Speaker 0: So if I do that, I'll actually just be losing a dollar because I could just put two guys in there directly.

950
00:53:29,441 --> 00:53:38,760
Speaker 0: But rather than spending a dollar and a folder and one guy to get two guys in, I can just spend two guys with the dollars that you might go into print instead.

951
00:53:38,961 --> 00:53:39,182
Speaker 0: Right.

952
00:53:39,222 --> 00:53:47,580
Speaker 0: And I calculated all these different possibilities every turn and they all turned out to be equal, except for a few where I would just lose a dollar for no reason.

953
00:53:47,861 --> 00:53:49,180
Speaker 1: See, now they're equal in a vacuum.

954
00:53:49,281 --> 00:53:50,880
Speaker 1: But the problem is you get both.

955
00:53:51,723 --> 00:53:55,520
Speaker 0: They were equal in terms of the number of popularity points I would have received.

956
00:53:55,900 --> 00:54:01,100
Speaker 1: Ah, but were you also taking into account the fact that whoever has the most tokens, each one of those areas also gets bonus popularity?

957
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:04,719
Speaker 0: I was, at least in those specific scenarios that I was in.

958
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:05,964
Speaker 0: You know, I could not.

959
00:54:06,004 --> 00:54:14,278
Speaker 0: I would basically have gained the same whether I put two workers directly into networking to one guy into advertising.

960
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:25,900
Speaker 1: Would you have gained the same effectively if you would land on the same space as someone else and they were in print, but you were in broadcast instead of networking?

961
00:54:26,301 --> 00:54:28,693
Speaker 0: I couldn't figure that out because the rules are all.

962
00:54:28,773 --> 00:54:29,457
Speaker 1: that's the part.

963
00:54:29,477 --> 00:54:30,140
Speaker 1: that's the problem.

964
00:54:30,301 --> 00:54:37,800
Speaker 1: Even if I figure out that if I do this, this is my optimal way to get the same number of popularity points is what I calculated.

965
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:44,878
Speaker 0: But I didn't calculate whether I would land there second or third or first, thus determining my actual popularity order.

966
00:54:45,321 --> 00:54:49,238
Speaker 1: And in general, some parts of the board, it's a benefit to be the first one in.

967
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:52,139
Speaker 1: in some parts of the board is the benefit to be the last one in.

968
00:54:53,041 --> 00:54:56,439
Speaker 1: And the game just doesn't take that into account very well.

969
00:54:57,304 --> 00:54:57,400
Speaker 0: Nope.

970
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:02,199
Speaker 1: So I don't know what I can say about this game.

971
00:55:03,043 --> 00:55:04,777
Speaker 1: Other than that, I kind of hate it.

972
00:55:06,162 --> 00:55:08,374
Speaker 0: I don't know if I hate the game and I'm definitely not going to.

973
00:55:08,495 --> 00:55:10,659
Speaker 1: I hate it because I enjoyed it so much.

974
00:55:11,301 --> 00:55:19,360
Speaker 1: And then after the first third, I realized that the game is going to take four hours and just going to be increasingly tedious.

975
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:21,448
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't hate it.

976
00:55:21,468 --> 00:55:22,759
Speaker 0: We're definitely never going to play it again.

977
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:28,820
Speaker 0: Apparently, this game was part of a Kickstarter where you got two similarly themed games from the same designer.

978
00:55:29,581 --> 00:55:33,680
Speaker 0: The other game that came with this is Skyline, which is sort of a nice Yahtzee.

979
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:34,445
Speaker 0: I kind of like it.

980
00:55:34,668 --> 00:55:35,779
Speaker 1: Skyline is actually pretty fun.

981
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,105
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a Yahtzee.

982
00:55:37,226 --> 00:55:41,297
Speaker 0: You roll dice, you reroll the one, you know, but there's a little different rules to it.

983
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:45,783
Speaker 0: Are you trying to build buildings instead of matching particular slots on your Yahtzee card?

984
00:55:46,488 --> 00:55:47,940
Speaker 0: You can roll different kinds of dice.

985
00:55:48,902 --> 00:55:52,561
Speaker 0: If you're looking for a Yahtzee type of game and you don't roll through the ages, you can play.

986
00:55:52,622 --> 00:55:54,780
Speaker 0: roll through the ages or you can play Skyline.

987
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,200
Speaker 0: They're both better than Yahtzee.

988
00:55:56,341 --> 00:55:59,656
Speaker 0: And they're pretty much, you know, fill that same niche or same role.

989
00:56:02,304 --> 00:56:04,075
Speaker 1: I thought about buying Skyline, but it's 30 bucks.

990
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:05,482
Speaker 0: Fuck that.

991
00:56:05,543 --> 00:56:08,820
Speaker 1: It's not 30 bucks for what amounts to a pile of dice.

992
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:09,402
Speaker 1: Yeah.

993
00:56:09,603 --> 00:56:12,579
Speaker 1: And in some cards for that, you might as well just play Yahtzee.

994
00:56:12,941 --> 00:56:13,244
Speaker 0: Yeah.

995
00:56:13,345 --> 00:56:14,840
Speaker 0: Or roll through that much as roll through the ages.

996
00:56:15,285 --> 00:56:15,831
Speaker 1: I don't know.

997
00:56:16,216 --> 00:56:16,499
Speaker 0: Check it.

998
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,111
Speaker 1: Roll through the ages is 30 bucks.

999
00:56:19,481 --> 00:56:20,760
Speaker 0: OK, well, neither of those.

1000
00:56:20,983 --> 00:56:22,340
Speaker 1: No, that's roll through the ages.

1001
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,180
Speaker 0: Bronze Age is an expansion.

1002
00:56:25,863 --> 00:56:28,220
Speaker 1: I don't see anything but roll through the ages.

1003
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:29,839
Speaker 0: Oh, no, that is roll through the ages.

1004
00:56:30,343 --> 00:56:30,745
Speaker 0: That is it.

1005
00:56:31,914 --> 00:56:32,660
Speaker 1: The Bronze Age.

1006
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,439
Speaker 0: Yeah, it says the Bronze Age on it.

1007
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:38,419
Speaker 1: I haven't played this game in almost two years, I think.

1008
00:56:38,801 --> 00:56:39,045
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1009
00:56:39,898 --> 00:56:39,999
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1010
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:41,780
Speaker 0: Don't spend thirty dollars for Yahtzee clone.

1011
00:56:41,861 --> 00:56:42,978
Speaker 0: That's crook slightly so.

1012
00:56:43,242 --> 00:56:44,139
Speaker 0: Yeah, with a different theme.

1013
00:56:44,482 --> 00:56:47,417
Speaker 1: But it's just this game is you?

1014
00:56:47,458 --> 00:56:47,860
Speaker 1: try it.

1015
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:50,979
Speaker 1: If you have some don't buy it, don't buy this game by any means.

1016
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:54,260
Speaker 1: But find someone else who has it or pick it up in a tabletop library.

1017
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:57,480
Speaker 1: Get someone to teach you how to play it and play the first few rounds.

1018
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,379
Speaker 1: You'll see what we mean.

1019
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:02,999
Speaker 1: It's super fun until you get about three rounds in.

1020
00:57:03,321 --> 00:57:06,820
Speaker 0: And everyone's got a bunch of employees and way too many time markers.

1021
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:09,100
Speaker 1: And also that's when someone's like, you know what?

1022
00:57:09,363 --> 00:57:10,620
Speaker 1: I want to have my popularity.

1023
00:57:10,922 --> 00:57:13,080
Speaker 1: And then everyone's got to start playing that popularity game.

1024
00:57:13,445 --> 00:57:14,579
Speaker 1: that becomes the whole game.

1025
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,399
Speaker 1: It's not intuitive and not fun.

1026
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:23,140
Speaker 1: The game requires so much calculation on the players parts to have any chance of doing better than other players and winning.

1027
00:57:23,581 --> 00:57:28,932
Speaker 1: And that part and all the other rest of the game is just completely obvious brain dead decisions.

1028
00:57:29,013 --> 00:57:29,960
Speaker 1: Ninety nine percent of the time.

1029
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:35,480
Speaker 0: If you want to play a game that consists of a bunch of separate smaller games that tie into each other, just play power grid.

1030
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:36,482
Speaker 0: Right.

1031
00:57:36,563 --> 00:57:37,112
Speaker 0: Don't play this.

1032
00:57:37,357 --> 00:57:37,519
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1033
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:42,520
Speaker 1: And if you want to play a good worker placement game that isn't a curricula, just play Kalis.

1034
00:57:43,401 --> 00:57:45,454
Speaker 0: You can also play, I guess, Le Havre is out.

1035
00:57:45,494 --> 00:57:46,400
Speaker 0: there is a lot of them.

1036
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,739
Speaker 1: I like Le Havre OK, but I don't like it that much.

1037
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,089
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've only played like once.

1038
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:51,260
Speaker 0: I don't know if I played it twice.

1039
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:51,925
Speaker 1: I own it.

1040
00:57:51,945 --> 00:57:52,695
Speaker 1: We can play it again.

1041
00:57:52,715 --> 00:57:53,039
Speaker 0: I own it.

1042
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,178
Speaker 1: I thought I owned it.

1043
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:57,815
Speaker 0: No, I bought Ora at La Vara, which is also.

1044
00:57:58,056 --> 00:57:58,879
Speaker 0: maybe we could play that, too.

1045
00:57:59,261 --> 00:58:10,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, I haven't played those other ones enough to know if I like them more or less than it's hard to say, because as much as I like them when I play them, whenever I think back to Kalis, I forget how much I actually really like Kalis.

1046
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:11,058
Speaker 0: Kalis is really good.

1047
00:58:11,423 --> 00:58:12,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, I feel like I could play Kalis again.

1048
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,500
Speaker 1: It's all about the castle.

1049
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:17,260
Speaker 1: 20 cubes in the castle.

1050
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:18,625
Speaker 0: That's right.

1051
00:58:18,645 --> 00:58:21,379
Speaker 0: Except that one guy beat us with the gold frickin jeweler.

1052
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:22,223
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was.

1053
00:58:22,264 --> 00:58:24,019
Speaker 1: that was a close really run affair, though.

1054
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,239
Speaker 1: If I'd gotten a couple more stone, I would have beaten him.

1055
00:58:27,183 --> 00:58:30,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, plus he pretty much gold, gold, golded in a vacuum and we ignored him.

1056
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:31,640
Speaker 1: Scoffed at him, in fact.

1057
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:35,800
Speaker 0: Let's let's end the show with this by saying Netrunner is still the best game play.

1058
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:36,183
Speaker 0: Netrunner.

1059
00:58:36,405 --> 00:58:37,799
Speaker 1: Netrunner is a pretty good game.

1060
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:42,339
Speaker 1: Scott's been playing XCOM, so we'll probably talk about XCOM in an upcoming game.

1061
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:43,249
Speaker 1: I'm not playing XCOM.

1062
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:45,057
Speaker 0: That doesn't begin with the letter N. I'm not playing that.

1063
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,318
Speaker 0: I only play games that begin with the letter N.

1064
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:48,912
Speaker 1: Scott's been playing The.

1065
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:52,800
Speaker 1: You don't count the when you're cataloging a game in the title of a game.

1066
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:53,242
Speaker 0: I'm playing.

1067
00:58:53,362 --> 00:58:57,840
Speaker 0: I am playing a game called natural selection two and a game called Netrunner and a game.

1068
00:58:58,422 --> 00:59:00,180
Speaker 1: The new XCOM.

1069
00:59:00,681 --> 00:59:04,920
Speaker 1: No, I'm playing enemy unknown.

1070
00:59:06,381 --> 00:59:07,530
Speaker 0: Begins with the sound N, enemy.

1071
00:59:09,521 --> 00:59:15,139
Speaker 1: We probably won't do any more shows this week because if you couldn't tell, I'm still kind of fighting off this flu.

1072
00:59:17,922 --> 00:59:19,659
Speaker 1: Not completely having fought it off yet.

1073
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:23,940
Speaker 0: Well, Geek Nights will return to normal next week up until anime Boston.

1074
00:59:24,581 --> 00:59:27,400
Speaker 0: We'll bring you a show about mocha comics probably again.

1075
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:28,680
Speaker 1: We'll be a little more high energy.

1076
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, it'll be good.

1077
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:31,108
Speaker 1: We're coming back.

1078
00:59:31,311 --> 00:59:32,060
Speaker 1: Just give us time.

1079
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:36,859
Speaker 0: We see also a lot of stuff saved up from the you know, all this time of no shows that we can bust out.

1080
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:39,399
Speaker 1: All right, kids, see you in a week.

1081
00:59:45,013 --> 00:59:47,130
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1082
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:52,290

1089
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:41,471

Speaker 1: What the fuck?

1094
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:47,190
Speaker 0: Duh, you broke everything.

1095
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:48,288
Speaker 1: You were way louder than me.

1096
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:50,433
Speaker 1: Ooh.

1097
01:00:50,453 --> 01:00:50,514
Speaker 1: Ooh.

1098
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:55,440
Speaker 0: You moved the novelty to be too loud.
