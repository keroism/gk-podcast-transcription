1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,380
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, May 8th, 2018.

2
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,583
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,623 --> 00:00:14,790
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek night tonight.

4
00:00:15,332 --> 00:00:25,316
Speaker 0: Battle tech the video game the new one Not any of the old battle taking 20 80 not the one on the SNES We'll use on that warrior.

5
00:00:25,657 --> 00:00:28,570
Speaker 1: people use years to tell different things apart that have the same name.

6
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:29,755
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do that in the time.

7
00:00:29,775 --> 00:00:31,843
Speaker 1: When has there ever been like a doom?

8
00:00:31,924 --> 00:00:40,022
Speaker 1: and then the same year also do Call Right, or they might be like doom video game and do board game.

9
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,109
Speaker 1: But yeah, then you can just say what you know.

10
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,256
Speaker 0: Yeah, very rare is doesn't?

11
00:00:44,276 --> 00:00:47,006
Speaker 1: that is not battle tech and battle tech in the same year.

12
00:00:47,287 --> 00:00:52,949
Speaker 0: Yeah so, uh Stanley Cup playoffs are happening and it's still weird to me.

13
00:00:53,311 --> 00:01:00,770
Speaker 0: This is the first time in my entire sentient life that no team I cared about was in the Stanley Cup playoffs.

14
00:01:01,373 --> 00:01:11,269
Speaker 0: Like there were some years where the Red Wings got eliminated in the first round But they were always there and the first year in a long long long long time They were not in the playoffs.

15
00:01:11,511 --> 00:01:28,809
Speaker 0: I think they set a record for most consecutive playoff occurrences in the modern like not original six era because the original six era What four teams made it to the playoffs out of six and it was the same for almost every year But not counting the Challenge Cup era for obvious reasons.

16
00:01:29,252 --> 00:01:35,650
Speaker 0: But just as the Red Wings for the first time didn't make it I'd been living in New York for like a decade and the Rangers are in the play.

17
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,510
Speaker 1: So there was a screenshot someone showed from I guess a shot from one of the games recently.

18
00:01:40,657 --> 00:01:40,827
Speaker 1: Yeah

19
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:40,970
Speaker 0: I

20
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:56,947
Speaker 1: probably I think a lightning game and it was like players with most playoff appearances in the past X years and it was just like a little corner graphic and almost everyone on that list was a New York Ranger until very recently,

21
00:01:57,087 --> 00:01:57,569
Speaker 0: so I guess it

22
00:01:57,609 --> 00:01:58,010
Speaker 1: was like.

23
00:02:02,442 --> 00:02:04,410
Speaker 0: Well to your point it's zero cups.

24
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:09,243
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's why it was most playoff game appearances.

25
00:02:09,423 --> 00:02:11,510
Speaker 1: Yeah going deep got you more on that list.

26
00:02:11,952 --> 00:02:19,789
Speaker 0: I'm uh, I'm very conflicted now because on one hand I just wanted no Pennsylvania team to still be in the playoffs and we have succeeded at this.

27
00:02:21,671 --> 00:02:24,702
Speaker 0: But Pennsylvania is the bottom right corner and they're gone the asshole.

28
00:02:24,722 --> 00:02:30,704
Speaker 1: they put all their stupid balls in the football Yeah, and fuck them, but well, it's it's past.

29
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:40,487
Speaker 0: and on one hand I don't like Tampa because they have historically been a team that has not teams I care about out of the playoffs, but on the other hand, it's basically the Tampa Rangers.

30
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:43,942
Speaker 1: at this point It is the 2015 New York Rangers of Florida.

31
00:02:44,324 --> 00:02:45,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, 2015, Florida Rangers.

32
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:50,270
Speaker 0: And as I forgot until you reminded me Rangers get a conditional draft pick, right?

33
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:59,990
Speaker 1: So there is a conditional draft pick where if Tampa wins the cup this year, I think or maybe even next year Then the they have a draft pick that already belongs to the Rangers.

34
00:03:00,151 --> 00:03:05,450
Speaker 1: But that draft pick will move from the second round to the first round if Tampa wins.

35
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:08,190
Speaker 1: And of course if Tampa wins it would be the last pick in the first round.

36
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,169
Speaker 1: But last pick in the first round is still a few pigs better than you know.

37
00:03:13,592 --> 00:03:16,442
Speaker 1: Pick it like close to last pick in the second round.

38
00:03:16,562 --> 00:03:25,403
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a big move up if Tampa wins So but on the other hand that upper left quadrant of like the Predators and the Jets I don't really watch those teams or know about him.

39
00:03:25,423 --> 00:03:26,470
Speaker 0: I don't really care that much.

40
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:32,696
Speaker 1: Well, because you know unlike the other sporting leagues, you know It's like you don't see.

41
00:03:33,037 --> 00:03:36,450
Speaker 1: but if you're in the hockey East you don't see the West too much.

42
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, you see like the West like one game a year per team.

43
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:48,188
Speaker 0: But I think in the end I'm still rooting for the Vegas Golden Knights and the reasons are pretty simple one if they win They will be fucking insufferable.

44
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,619
Speaker 0: There'll be an entire year of batting a thousand.

45
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,301
Speaker 0: That's right.

46
00:03:52,341 --> 00:04:00,369
Speaker 1: every Stanley Cup we've been up for came in and taught you Yeah, it's just like when rim plays a game for the first time and wins.

47
00:04:01,294 --> 00:04:02,570
Speaker 1: I'm undefeated in this game.

48
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:08,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, my my pro move is to learn a degenerate baby strategy for a first time game and never play it again.

49
00:04:10,493 --> 00:04:13,450
Speaker 1: Well, you can say this if you were you the Golden Knights you would stop playing hockey.

50
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,785
Speaker 0: Yeah, just retire the team like we're done hundred percent Stanley Cups.

51
00:04:16,885 --> 00:04:17,930
Speaker 1: close the arena we built.

52
00:04:20,331 --> 00:04:21,214
Speaker 0: So it'll also.

53
00:04:21,755 --> 00:04:24,304
Speaker 0: it'll anger the most people.

54
00:04:24,906 --> 00:04:25,909
Speaker 1: no doesn't anger me.

55
00:04:25,989 --> 00:04:28,179
Speaker 1: yeah I just think I don't know why people are upset.

56
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:30,510
Speaker 0: people like Don Cherry will probably be furious.

57
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,396
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think he'd be madder.

58
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,543
Speaker 0: I think he'd be really mad about this.

59
00:04:35,564 --> 00:04:36,005
Speaker 1: who cares?

60
00:04:36,487 --> 00:04:39,473
Speaker 1: so I've been watching They win.

61
00:04:39,554 --> 00:04:43,750
Speaker 1: or like the Jets win, what's the difference, you know, the national predators aren't a very old team.

62
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,460
Speaker 1: What if they win is not what they're allowed, you know, yes But is this so the reason I bring this up?

63
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,947
Speaker 0: cuz I think I kind of when I panels.

64
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:50,630
Speaker 0: they talked about this.

65
00:04:51,212 --> 00:04:52,899
Speaker 0: I and I've been talking about this a lot lately.

66
00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:58,841
Speaker 0: I think the Vegas Golden Knights are doing so well Specifically because of the structure of the expansion draft.

67
00:04:58,881 --> 00:04:59,142
Speaker 1: Yes.

68
00:04:59,302 --> 00:05:01,490
Speaker 1: This is not a thing you think this is the thing that is.

69
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, but game did like game design is Tuesday geek night.

70
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:12,173
Speaker 1: So the deal is if you play the expansion draft was structured in such a way and the owner and the GM of the Golden Knights milk it.

71
00:05:12,454 --> 00:05:17,190
Speaker 1: they made deals before the draft even happened to sort everything out.

72
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:24,936
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that they basically it wasn't an expansion draft because usually when there's an expansion in sports You have multiple teams coming in.

73
00:05:24,977 --> 00:05:26,703
Speaker 1: here is just one team being added.

74
00:05:26,843 --> 00:05:28,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they basically wasn't a draft.

75
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,333
Speaker 1: It was a looting.

76
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:30,699
Speaker 1: they looted all the other team.

77
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:33,190
Speaker 0: every team could protect like a small number of people.

78
00:05:33,632 --> 00:05:41,610
Speaker 0: So this team this is a hockey team that could not get any superstars But could otherwise get pretty much anyone they wanted and design their team.

79
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,575
Speaker 0: It's like the difference between.

80
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:45,770
Speaker 0: here's the analogy in dungeons and dragons third and fourth edition.

81
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:54,345
Speaker 0: If you play a character from level 1 to level 10 You're gonna make a lot of compromises along the way because the sunk cost and situations and everything.

82
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,559
Speaker 1: and you build you this thing Again, you can explain it much simpler than that.

83
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,099
Speaker 1: It's like you're playing El Grande and you know And you can't get first place anywhere.

84
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:03,838
Speaker 1: You just automatically get second place everywhere You win.

85
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:04,866
Speaker 1: Yeah at the most points.

86
00:06:05,088 --> 00:06:05,852
Speaker 0: Yep The end.

87
00:06:06,153 --> 00:06:15,190
Speaker 0: but if you make a D&D character level 10 from the beginning you craft that perfect specialty option from the beginning and ignore all the history.

88
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:17,758
Speaker 0: So I don't see what happens in the hockey's.

89
00:06:18,059 --> 00:06:19,465
Speaker 0: but there is much more important news.

90
00:06:19,987 --> 00:06:22,759
Speaker 1: at least for me This is such isn't the biggest news.

91
00:06:23,081 --> 00:06:25,010
Speaker 0: It is for me because the steam controller is garbage.

92
00:06:25,372 --> 00:06:25,814
Speaker 0: I said it.

93
00:06:25,914 --> 00:06:28,930
Speaker 1: so the steam controller is kind of I mean it has good parts in bed.

94
00:06:29,372 --> 00:06:33,070
Speaker 0: Boy has two good parts the left paddle button the right paddle button.

95
00:06:33,592 --> 00:06:36,766
Speaker 1: But yeah, the steam controller is not the controller of choice.

96
00:06:36,806 --> 00:06:38,717
Speaker 1: I think for pretty much anyone There's a reason why.

97
00:06:38,737 --> 00:06:40,350
Speaker 1: there's a reason why they're in the discount bin.

98
00:06:40,871 --> 00:06:45,446
Speaker 0: There's a reason why my steam controller ran out of battery because there wasn't even a battery in it anymore.

99
00:06:45,687 --> 00:06:49,782
Speaker 1: Xbox controller At least the Xbox 360 controller is still great.

100
00:06:50,224 --> 00:06:51,630
Speaker 1: I haven't used an X bone controller.

101
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:56,350
Speaker 1: I'm sure it's just fine except the d-pad on it is meh, but otherwise just fine if you don't need the d-pad.

102
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,457
Speaker 1: D-pad is serviceable, but not great.

103
00:06:58,577 --> 00:07:02,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, the PlayStation controller a lot of people love those fart noise.

104
00:07:03,011 --> 00:07:08,810
Speaker 1: The only reason I do not like them is because the d-pad on them while functional has separation.

105
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:16,610
Speaker 1: I mean, I know that it's still underneath a solid d-pad But it has this plastic cross so that you can't really touch all of that d-pad.

106
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:25,242
Speaker 1: It's it's effectively like these four separate buttons sort of and it offends my sensibilities Even though it works better than the Xbox one.

107
00:07:25,262 --> 00:07:27,170
Speaker 1: I add is unusable for me.

108
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:27,672
Speaker 0: Well, that's it.

109
00:07:27,732 --> 00:07:31,570
Speaker 1: It offends our old grog Nardi sensibilities, but the rest of the controller is just fine.

110
00:07:31,871 --> 00:07:35,450
Speaker 0: I have a much more fundamental beef with the PlayStation controller.

111
00:07:36,012 --> 00:07:41,990
Speaker 0: I never really had PlayStations and during the Soul Calibur era Soul Calibur 2 I use the game of cube controller.

112
00:07:42,151 --> 00:07:44,501
Speaker 0: I don't want to use a PlayStation controller.

113
00:07:44,542 --> 00:07:46,370
Speaker 1: controller is basically perfect.

114
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:58,572
Speaker 1: Yeah, except for the fact that it's kind of weird and doesn't really match well with games that use a normal shape Except for Soul Calibur 2 where it matched better than any other controller because the whole horizontal vertical attack thing Right.

115
00:07:58,652 --> 00:08:01,870
Speaker 1: Anyway, so now you've got the switch pro controller.

116
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:07,648
Speaker 1: The switch pro controller is basically perfect except it does not have analog buttons on the top.

117
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,494
Speaker 1: and oh, you know The the throttling ones.

118
00:08:09,554 --> 00:08:11,421
Speaker 1: it only has four regular buttons on the.

119
00:08:11,461 --> 00:08:12,345
Speaker 0: but to be fair.

120
00:08:12,365 --> 00:08:13,730
Speaker 0: I haven't played a game.

121
00:08:14,052 --> 00:08:15,783
Speaker 1: Two regular buttons on the top.

122
00:08:16,105 --> 00:08:16,770
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

123
00:08:17,913 --> 00:08:22,617
Speaker 1: The point is it doesn't have the throttles like, you know The the analog levers for anything.

124
00:08:22,858 --> 00:08:24,422
Speaker 1: needs that any racing game.

125
00:08:24,944 --> 00:08:27,030
Speaker 0: name a name a game that needs that that you play.

126
00:08:27,554 --> 00:08:29,127
Speaker 1: I place f-zero will come.

127
00:08:30,032 --> 00:08:34,003
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, we'll see what happens if f-zero comes on the switch.

128
00:08:34,063 --> 00:08:35,769
Speaker 1: Mario Kart doesn't have it but it could.

129
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:36,772
Speaker 0: yeah It could.

130
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:38,561
Speaker 0: now cuz Mario Kart is a whole different ballgame.

131
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,986
Speaker 1: I'm just saying Mario Kart.

132
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:42,376
Speaker 0: there There are exactly two settings.

133
00:08:42,638 --> 00:08:45,087
Speaker 0: Your gas is going all the time or you have lost.

134
00:08:45,267 --> 00:08:50,582
Speaker 1: I'm just saying Racing games where you want to have that analog throttle.

135
00:08:50,643 --> 00:08:57,090
Speaker 0: I'm just saying name a racing game you have played I don't know in the last decade f-zero Where did what did you last play f-zero?

136
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,990
Speaker 1: definitely since 2008.

137
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,062
Speaker 0: yeah since 2008.

138
00:09:03,062 --> 00:09:04,108
Speaker 1: Then I played f-zero GX

139
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:08,605
Speaker 0: Anyway, but this is a big deal for me partly because

140
00:09:09,128 --> 00:09:22,208
Speaker 1: oh, but yeah The news is that steam is now officially supporting the switch pro controller Which means you can now use it with your HDPC and you can get rid of your Xbox controllers that you had just because.

141
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:26,923
Speaker 1: yeah Yeah, but the thing is the switch pro controller is more expensive.

142
00:09:26,963 --> 00:09:28,750
Speaker 1: I'm not like throwing out my Xbox controllers.

143
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,217
Speaker 0: The other thing you know, it's gonna happen.

144
00:09:30,317 --> 00:09:31,743
Speaker 1: It's annoying to switch.

145
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:33,029
Speaker 1: It's it's a switch.

146
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:37,242
Speaker 1: I know I just swap the pro controller between your switch and your PC.

147
00:09:37,302 --> 00:09:39,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, so and buying more of them would be expensive.

148
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,804
Speaker 1: So I'm not gonna probably do this unless like I really need to get

149
00:09:43,025 --> 00:09:56,909
Speaker 0: I am going to buy one more pro controller to plug into my main PC not my HDPC because I play a lot of games here and I don't want to have to keep repairing the Xbox controllers in the other room in here on this PC.

150
00:09:56,989 --> 00:10:01,629
Speaker 0: and I don't want to use the fucking steam controller because I have a very low opinion of it.

151
00:10:01,991 --> 00:10:07,026
Speaker 1: You know what game needs those analog levers that I have played definitely within the last decade.

152
00:10:07,247 --> 00:10:11,222
Speaker 1: Yeah Rocket League Oh, yep, actually the steam controller is the only thing.

153
00:10:11,262 --> 00:10:13,290
Speaker 0: I mean, how does Rocket League work on the switch?

154
00:10:15,475 --> 00:10:15,963
Speaker 1: Not as good.

155
00:10:16,348 --> 00:10:18,850
Speaker 1: Oh Okay, I haven't played Rocket League on the switch.

156
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:26,723
Speaker 1: I used to actually use the steam controller when I played Rocket League and actually I did too because that was It was like actually good for that the pedal buttons.

157
00:10:26,763 --> 00:10:27,848
Speaker 0: I used for my juking around.

158
00:10:27,888 --> 00:10:28,811
Speaker 0: It was yeah It was.

159
00:10:28,912 --> 00:10:34,467
Speaker 1: it was actually, you know better than slightly better than the Xbox controller in some ways for that one game.

160
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:37,076
Speaker 0: Yep Man, just steam.

161
00:10:37,658 --> 00:10:43,249
Speaker 1: Why can't someone just make a switch pro controller with some analog levers on it And then it can throw away every other controller and buy five of those?

162
00:10:43,531 --> 00:10:51,080
Speaker 0: Yep, that would be worth the investment and then never buy another controller again, frankly I should just get USB converters or use an old gaming cube controllers.

163
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:53,307
Speaker 1: I mean the switch pro controller is USB C.

164
00:10:54,312 --> 00:11:02,084
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah but the fact that it's getting official support is a big deal because Actually also I have a USB converter that can take four game controllers at once.

165
00:11:02,144 --> 00:11:07,809
Speaker 0: there was a time in my life when I was Very willing to hack and fiddle with things, but I don't got time for that shit.

166
00:11:08,511 --> 00:11:14,649
Speaker 0: I am too old to like install a special driver to make a weird thing work on my control on my computer.

167
00:11:14,669 --> 00:11:21,166
Speaker 0: Nope so in some other news, I Played two games at pat does then kai khan.

168
00:11:21,206 --> 00:11:22,653
Speaker 1: so it's not news It's a gig.

169
00:11:22,713 --> 00:11:24,661
Speaker 0: It's two gig bites really big bites.

170
00:11:24,781 --> 00:11:27,150
Speaker 0: I'm gonna talk about these two games because they're there is a thread.

171
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,197
Speaker 0: They are both designed by coal.

172
00:11:29,478 --> 00:11:31,223
Speaker 0: Well, where are they?

173
00:11:31,244 --> 00:11:33,210
Speaker 1: Well, you can't even pronounce the person's name.

174
00:11:33,452 --> 00:11:51,190
Speaker 0: Oh, but these are two games That I don't know if you will like but you seem to want to play And They're similar in some regard John made by the same person and an infamous traffic.

175
00:11:51,551 --> 00:11:52,856
Speaker 1: Well, I've heard of the John company.

176
00:11:53,057 --> 00:11:56,190
Speaker 0: So an infamous traffic is the same person and similar concept.

177
00:11:56,551 --> 00:12:09,910
Speaker 0: So the idea of an infamous traffic or both these games are that there is a historical So geo-economic or power structure of some kind like the opium in infamous traffic is about the opium trade.

178
00:12:10,311 --> 00:12:10,852
Speaker 1: Oh great.

179
00:12:11,474 --> 00:12:13,881
Speaker 0: And yeah, these are these games are interesting.

180
00:12:13,921 --> 00:12:16,347
Speaker 1: So it's based on the car the present day.

181
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:25,039
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah, especially because like I might argue that the area around Lancaster is the Ground zero of the current opioid epidemic.

182
00:12:25,962 --> 00:12:26,544
Speaker 1: It sounds right.

183
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:30,496
Speaker 0: I will say that jokes about Pennsylvania and Lancaster.

184
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:34,190
Speaker 0: in the course of playing this game in Lancaster where shall we say abundance?

185
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,568
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm as were people who appeared to be.

186
00:12:37,394 --> 00:12:37,978
Speaker 0: There appeared to be.

187
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:43,880
Speaker 0: there's a mechanic in this game called opportunity Which basically means are there people who want opium in this area?

188
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:50,648
Speaker 0: Yes, and I think that there were a lot of opportunities in the area where this convention is.

189
00:12:51,832 --> 00:13:05,710
Speaker 0: But John company and I realized got to know this is about the British East India company Mm-hmm, and if you don't know most people I realized have a middle school social studies knowledge of what the East India Company did.

190
00:13:06,255 --> 00:13:08,580
Speaker 0: Don't really know Both of these.

191
00:13:08,601 --> 00:13:09,550
Speaker 1: I mean, I know what it did.

192
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:15,642
Speaker 1: I just didn't know the one fact that you just told me which is that the name of it was not I do that East India.

193
00:13:15,682 --> 00:13:16,609
Speaker 0: What did it do?

194
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:24,089
Speaker 1: Completely controlled all trade between Britain and all these colonies and all these other places and such and such.

195
00:13:24,773 --> 00:13:26,542
Speaker 0: It's actually way more complicated than that.

196
00:13:26,603 --> 00:13:30,819
Speaker 0: it was basically its own Sovereign government mega Corp.

197
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:41,369
Speaker 0: Yep, and it had its own armies multiple of them So boats that invaded and conquered India on its own not without necessarily having permission to do so.

198
00:13:42,953 --> 00:13:58,389
Speaker 0: but anyway, these games are basically very nuanced and shockingly accurate simulations of How these two things functioned From the perspective of the people who were driving them.

199
00:13:58,831 --> 00:14:03,010
Speaker 0: So you basically in both cases play a shitty white dude in Britain?

200
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,678
Speaker 0: Who has and your victory points what you actually do to win.

201
00:14:06,698 --> 00:14:07,500
Speaker 0: the games are?

202
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:18,870
Speaker 0: analogous to the actual motivations of those people which came down to Bullshit around social standing and getting your relatives into comfortable positions.

203
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:39,770
Speaker 0: But as a result So in John company You're basically you're doing things like get someone in your family to be the executive in this part of the East India company Who's responsible for something and all the players get relatives in all these different places And if you have a relative who's like in charge of procurement or in charge of the second presidency army you

204
00:14:40,654 --> 00:14:40,775
Speaker 1: can do

205
00:14:40,795 --> 00:14:47,650
Speaker 0: whatever the fuck you want that you're in charge of that and You all have to work together to make sure the company doesn't just go bankrupt.

206
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:54,355
Speaker 0: Well simultaneously trying to achieve your goals and basically these games are Some of the most.

207
00:14:54,576 --> 00:14:56,830
Speaker 0: like you I were a teacher in a high school.

208
00:14:57,332 --> 00:15:01,310
Speaker 0: I would make kids play these games to learn about these concepts rather than read a history book.

209
00:15:01,751 --> 00:15:06,043
Speaker 0: That is how high an opinion I have on the history and function of these games.

210
00:15:06,604 --> 00:15:10,849
Speaker 0: However, I do not know if They're necessarily enjoyable.

211
00:15:11,572 --> 00:15:16,890
Speaker 0: Nor do I know if you will like them, but I like them and I would know I don't want to step that back.

212
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,862
Speaker 0: I appreciate them and I want to play them again.

213
00:15:20,882 --> 00:15:28,410
Speaker 0: I am not sure if I like them But I appreciate them and kind of like with quartermaster general.

214
00:15:28,571 --> 00:15:31,926
Speaker 0: I just want to play them again, and I just always want to play them again.

215
00:15:31,946 --> 00:15:36,504
Speaker 1: It's weird How I like quartermaster general, but it doesn't matter because you're a bullshit.

216
00:15:36,545 --> 00:15:37,930
Speaker 0: you are banned from quartermaster.

217
00:15:38,353 --> 00:15:40,870
Speaker 1: I don't know why you guys are against just slightly.

218
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,779
Speaker 0: You're banned from quartermaster general.

219
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:44,903
Speaker 0: You think we're joking.

220
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,430
Speaker 0: you're banned from this game for life.

221
00:15:48,351 --> 00:15:49,053
Speaker 1: What's your problem?

222
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,217
Speaker 0: because none of us want that.

223
00:15:50,437 --> 00:15:51,461
Speaker 1: why don't you want that?

224
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:54,330
Speaker 0: because the game as it is is exactly what we want.

225
00:15:54,491 --> 00:15:55,957
Speaker 1: Then why do you want garbage?

226
00:15:56,379 --> 00:15:58,610
Speaker 1: It's it's so close to perfection yet so far.

227
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:01,790
Speaker 0: This is why I don't know what your opinion will be of John company.

228
00:16:02,731 --> 00:16:06,969
Speaker 0: I don't know if you're gonna feel if you're gonna do the quartermaster general thing or if you're gonna be into it.

229
00:16:07,612 --> 00:16:14,938
Speaker 0: I all I know is that we got to play this game so we can do a show on it And I'm sure we will accomplish this at a coming packs.

230
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:24,884
Speaker 0: and in case anyone didn't know Scott is legit banned from the game of quartermaster And in perpetuity and you you laugh, but you are bad.

231
00:16:25,345 --> 00:16:27,470
Speaker 1: There's no way that game would just be so good.

232
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:30,907
Speaker 1: I don't know why you guys are so obstinate about making it already is so good.

233
00:16:30,947 --> 00:16:31,550
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

234
00:16:32,073 --> 00:16:34,910
Speaker 0: It's like saying you know what we really need to do to fix battle tech.

235
00:16:35,332 --> 00:16:39,730
Speaker 0: No small lasers and no jump jets because they're bullshit and no look-up tables.

236
00:16:40,811 --> 00:16:46,150
Speaker 1: No, it would be bullshit if you had dice that were like all ones with like one six on one of the dice.

237
00:16:46,331 --> 00:16:48,319
Speaker 0: But that's how it feels when you play real battle tech.

238
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:49,684
Speaker 0: Anyway, no, it's not.

239
00:16:49,745 --> 00:16:51,010
Speaker 0: It's always just miss bad.

240
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,856
Speaker 0: I guess miss glancing.

241
00:16:52,896 --> 00:16:53,999
Speaker 0: blow to center torso.

242
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:54,601
Speaker 1: battle is 2d 6.

243
00:16:54,601 --> 00:16:54,681
Speaker 1: Yep.

244
00:16:54,701 --> 00:16:57,530
Speaker 1: 2d 6 2d 6 2d 6.

245
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:03,467
Speaker 1: It's not like, you know a D that always rolls a 1 and then a D with 5 ones and a 6 on it.

246
00:17:04,932 --> 00:17:09,069
Speaker 0: So we got one less little news that isn't really gaming related, but you got to see this shit.

247
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:10,578
Speaker 1: Why I didn't?

248
00:17:10,637 --> 00:17:12,230
Speaker 1: I was just sending this to you cuz you need to see it.

249
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,296
Speaker 0: Oh, you don't want to talk about it today.

250
00:17:13,316 --> 00:17:14,300
Speaker 1: Is it for Monday?

251
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,307
Speaker 0: All right, we'll save for Monday.

252
00:17:15,347 --> 00:17:16,915
Speaker 1: Monday What the fuck you gonna do?

253
00:17:17,117 --> 00:17:19,290
Speaker 0: Never mind, you don't get to learn about this today.

254
00:17:25,332 --> 00:17:27,130
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day.

255
00:17:27,251 --> 00:17:29,320
Speaker 0: So I am a fan of Rube Goldberg machines.

256
00:17:29,702 --> 00:17:32,895
Speaker 0: when I was a kid in middle school in high school I competed in the Zulberg

257
00:17:32,915 --> 00:17:36,929
Speaker 1: machines have probably been things of the day more often than any other category of yep

258
00:17:37,471 --> 00:17:47,341
Speaker 0: But kind of like it's one of those rules where like a steamed hams edit where you can't just Use these things as things of the day Unless there's some unique thing about this

259
00:17:47,462 --> 00:17:47,562
Speaker 1: one.

260
00:17:47,582 --> 00:17:49,350
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm sure there's like a Rube Goldberg community.

261
00:17:49,711 --> 00:17:54,230
Speaker 1: We could make a whole podcast about Rube Goldberg machines only there probably is a tire podcast.

262
00:17:54,592 --> 00:17:54,794
Speaker 1: but

263
00:17:55,337 --> 00:18:21,246
Speaker 0: this Rube Goldberg machine is particularly fascinating because it breaks some of the tropes of Rube Goldberg machines and it also Surprised me at several junctures in terms of how it functioned and it was subtle Kinda like our friend Luke the juggler who makes points about how a juggling routine Can be made funny through intrinsic properties of juggling and good stagecraft.

264
00:18:21,888 --> 00:18:30,510
Speaker 0: There are some extremely well-crafted Visual jokes in this Rube Goldberg machine and I do not even want to spoil them.

265
00:18:30,932 --> 00:18:31,996
Speaker 0: You just need to watch it.

266
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:35,010
Speaker 0: And all I want to say is keep an eye on that laptop.

267
00:18:36,612 --> 00:18:38,610
Speaker 0: Okay, this Rube Goldberg machine is fantastic.

268
00:18:39,431 --> 00:18:47,110
Speaker 0: It's probably it is on the level of that slow motion Rube Goldberg machine that okay go did in terms of how much I enjoyed.

269
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,649
Speaker 1: Why like the Rube Goldberg the Japanese kids want to tell the story the story?

270
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,162
Speaker 0: Oh, what was that called a balls adventure something something like that.

271
00:18:54,223 --> 00:18:54,965
Speaker 0: I forget what that was.

272
00:18:55,026 --> 00:18:55,829
Speaker 0: Anyway, what do you got?

273
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,688
Speaker 1: Oh, so it's just a tweet, but the tweet had a funny video in it.

274
00:19:00,795 --> 00:19:02,206
Speaker 1: It looks like it's Japanese.

275
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:07,564
Speaker 1: Of course Basically two dudes in pink bodysuit things.

276
00:19:08,006 --> 00:19:13,370
Speaker 1: They're on some bicycle And this bicycle is interesting and that is a tandem bicycle.

277
00:19:14,073 --> 00:19:37,790
Speaker 1: Yet one of the seats the rear seat is facing Backwards so one person's facing forward and one person's facing backwards and they're riding on this sort of side of the road with a jersey Barrier next to them and on the other side of the jersey barrier is a legit pro bike race happening And the peloton is right there and they're biking ahead of the peloton And I guess one person is watching the race because they're facing back.

278
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:47,547
Speaker 0: It looks like bikers threw something at them at one point I don't know and the other like this very clueless moment where something gets thrown at them Like people don't seem happy about them being there I don't know.

279
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:51,670
Speaker 1: But the other the other person is just looking forward and biking and smiling.

280
00:19:51,711 --> 00:20:00,334
Speaker 1: Yeah if you go to the next tweet and reply you can actually see the bicycle up close and how the gearing works to Make this thing possible.

281
00:20:00,515 --> 00:20:01,517
Speaker 0: It's cleverly done.

282
00:20:01,537 --> 00:20:05,248
Speaker 1: It's you know, it's a hack together together mess, but it works.

283
00:20:05,308 --> 00:20:07,933
Speaker 0: So It's it's just.

284
00:20:07,953 --> 00:20:10,099
Speaker 0: they'll just watch it and appreciate it for what it is.

285
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:10,961
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

286
00:20:12,104 --> 00:20:20,236
Speaker 1: I like how the the text in the Pretty much as a bunch of W's and then some Japanese moon language In the meta moment.

287
00:20:20,296 --> 00:20:21,684
Speaker 0: the book club book for geek.

288
00:20:21,704 --> 00:20:26,524
Speaker 0: the geek nights book club If you didn't know we have a book club is Emily Wilson's translation of the Odyssey.

289
00:20:26,585 --> 00:20:30,458
Speaker 0: I assume Scott has read zero More pages of this good assumption.

290
00:20:30,639 --> 00:20:31,783
Speaker 0: All right, we will.

291
00:20:31,843 --> 00:20:32,245
Speaker 1: I'm busy.

292
00:20:32,285 --> 00:20:33,108
Speaker 1: I'm getting new furniture.

293
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:36,590
Speaker 1: on Saturday I had to take apart all the furniture in my apartment and throw it out.

294
00:20:37,011 --> 00:20:43,555
Speaker 0: I got a bunch of flights coming up cuz I'm going to be not Scott and not geek not just me with Emily at TCAF this weekend in Toronto.

295
00:20:43,615 --> 00:20:46,346
Speaker 0: So one if you're in Toronto and you're gonna be a TCAF.

296
00:20:46,447 --> 00:20:47,250
Speaker 1: What's TCAF?

297
00:20:48,971 --> 00:20:55,130
Speaker 0: It's basically a comic convention similar to like mocha or SPX or Emerald City comic-con.

298
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,489
Speaker 0: A lot of our friends will be there.

299
00:20:56,671 --> 00:20:56,933
Speaker 1: It's not.

300
00:20:56,993 --> 00:20:58,909
Speaker 1: Emerald City comic-con is like a real comic-con.

301
00:20:59,251 --> 00:21:03,090
Speaker 0: It's not an indie show like yeah, but there's a big indie presence there and a lot of the same people go.

302
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:06,069
Speaker 0: I mean New York comic-con has an indie presence in the artist alley too.

303
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,909
Speaker 0: I specifically left New York comic-con off that.

304
00:21:09,951 --> 00:21:12,099
Speaker 1: Emerald City is you know, no different than like Heroes.

305
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,070
Speaker 0: Emerald City has a way bigger indie presence than you realize.

306
00:21:15,311 --> 00:21:16,936
Speaker 1: So does every other comic-con.

307
00:21:17,156 --> 00:21:18,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, not New York comic-con.

308
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,644
Speaker 1: Even San Diego does.

309
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:23,649
Speaker 1: you just don't see it in the news about San Diego Because the news about San Diego doesn't cover it.

310
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:27,489
Speaker 1: Yeah, they have a giant and massive artist alley that has all the indie peoples in it.

311
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:33,135
Speaker 0: Yeah, not all because a lot of the people I know who go to these things that like a lot There's a lot of indie people.

312
00:21:33,155 --> 00:21:35,382
Speaker 1: Yeah, not all of them go to all the guys.

313
00:21:35,402 --> 00:21:46,670
Speaker 0: But there is a huge huge overlap between ECCC and SPX and TCAF and Though like that Venn diagram is tighter than a lot of the other clusters of conventions.

314
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:54,145
Speaker 0: but anyway, I'll be there hanging out and otherwise, they'll just be digging around in Toronto for the weekend and This previous weekend I was at Zenkai Con.

315
00:21:54,286 --> 00:21:54,990
Speaker 0: we did three panels.

316
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:59,653
Speaker 0: So if you were here listening to this or watching the stream because you saw me at Zenkai Con Well, guess what?

317
00:22:00,096 --> 00:22:10,304
Speaker 0: I posted notes and links and stuff If you go to our website A lot of people seem to find the YouTube channel Can't quite make the leap from that channel to the fact that we actually have a website.

318
00:22:10,545 --> 00:22:11,789
Speaker 1: people don't use websites.

319
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:14,878
Speaker 1: It's 2018 yep, like they just go to.

320
00:22:14,938 --> 00:22:18,067
Speaker 1: you know one place like Twitter only or YouTube only.

321
00:22:18,168 --> 00:22:26,190
Speaker 0: it's extra sad But I started putting links to our YouTube on our flyers instead of our website and it increased the response rate heavily.

322
00:22:27,671 --> 00:22:40,830
Speaker 0: so whatever we have a website and if you go to that website, you can see actually a video of one of the panels I did from a different con way more professional because it's the video for packs and Zenkai Con was super fun and the funniest thing that happened was on the way home.

323
00:22:41,171 --> 00:22:52,870
Speaker 0: there were all these teams who were on the train who went to Zenkai Con from New York City and they were loud and I Overheard their conversation and the conversation was basically these kids go to cons like you and I used to go to cons.

324
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,056
Speaker 0: They go to like every anime con.

325
00:22:54,076 --> 00:22:56,287
Speaker 0: Hmm, and they're pretty they get money from.

326
00:22:56,307 --> 00:22:56,970
Speaker 1: if they're teens.

327
00:22:57,532 --> 00:23:01,426
Speaker 0: Well, they're like teens and a couple of them are like freshmen in college and they go.

328
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:02,330
Speaker 1: where do they get money from?

329
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:02,851
Speaker 0: I don't know.

330
00:23:02,871 --> 00:23:03,092
Speaker 0: They do.

331
00:23:03,113 --> 00:23:06,369
Speaker 0: the East Coast Con circuit cram 12 people in a hotel room like we used to.

332
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,323
Speaker 0: but the funniest things were one.

333
00:23:09,343 --> 00:23:13,580
Speaker 0: they Someone brought up Otakon and they all started laughing.

334
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,290
Speaker 0: They're like, yeah who even fucking goes to Otakon anymore?

335
00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:18,216
Speaker 1: Otakon moved and changed in.

336
00:23:18,236 --> 00:23:18,417
Speaker 1: such.

337
00:23:18,658 --> 00:23:25,861
Speaker 0: one of them went this year and was like the previous Otakon and they were like Yeah the panels are like way worse than Zenkai Con's panels.

338
00:23:26,122 --> 00:23:29,678
Speaker 0: all the good people don't go anymore and And the convention center is a hole.

339
00:23:30,563 --> 00:23:34,840
Speaker 0: and one of the other ones is like yeah anime boss is like the only anime con worth going to anymore.

340
00:23:35,261 --> 00:23:43,695
Speaker 0: and then they basically were like if you want to see panels Literally go to any con because no con has higher quality panels, but they don't go to gaming cons They only go to anime cons.

341
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:55,710
Speaker 0: So in the estimation of this large group of teens to summarize Zenkai Con has the exact same level of quality of panels as every major anime con on the Eastern Seaboard.

342
00:23:57,432 --> 00:24:08,950
Speaker 0: I don't know if that is speaking highly of Zenkai Con or speaking lowly of the Eastern Seaboard But that is the information that I have from a large group of teens who are very loud over the course of two and a half hours.

343
00:24:10,838 --> 00:24:16,890
Speaker 0: So I Have always for a very long time because I really enjoyed playing battle tech which we reviewed on Geek Nights a long time ago.

344
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,000
Speaker 0: Apparently, I don't remember doing this.

345
00:24:19,462 --> 00:24:21,250
Speaker 0: I really like tabletop battle tech.

346
00:24:21,771 --> 00:24:28,070
Speaker 0: I really like rolling 2d6 over and over again and like this sort of squad based combat in these really fiddly details.

347
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,057
Speaker 1: Well cuz battle tech the pen and paper game.

348
00:24:30,077 --> 00:24:37,430
Speaker 1: We actually did an episode on it super super super long ago Back in the way early days of Geek Nights where we lived in Beacon.

349
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:47,703
Speaker 1: Yeah but pen and paper battle tech is a game where you can get all the joy of a miniatures game where you know on your Turn you move and shoot and you roll dice to determine how much you hit and such.

350
00:24:47,743 --> 00:24:48,746
Speaker 0: but miniatures game.

351
00:24:48,807 --> 00:24:49,609
Speaker 0: in the like it

352
00:24:49,690 --> 00:25:17,570
Speaker 1: is actually Simpler and more comprehensible and you dealing with less units and also giant robots Yeah, and you also get the fun of like custom, you know, instead of customizing like this whole army like Warhammer You you know in each individual unit you're actually just customizing like a couple giant robots and it's pretty easy to do, you know, and It's fun to fill in little bubbles when you get hit right like everything about it is like this sort of.

353
00:25:18,512 --> 00:25:26,430
Speaker 1: It's sort of like this elegant system where you have a complex game That is easier to play than other games that are equally complex.

354
00:25:26,678 --> 00:25:32,410
Speaker 1: Yep Because it's just designed so nicely and that is why battle tech has been around Almost as long as I have lived.

355
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:38,920
Speaker 1: I think the game was invented in like 1984 or something like that but also it's been around since then and it's still around and it's still big.

356
00:25:39,181 --> 00:25:44,216
Speaker 0: these games edge into wargame territory and Simulatory territory and that they're.

357
00:25:44,717 --> 00:25:57,296
Speaker 0: they're more like simulations and simulations of this fictional galaxy universe whatever you want to call it, but in terms of they're kind of random and not that fair and more like Real-world tactical decision-making.

358
00:25:57,357 --> 00:25:58,560
Speaker 0: like it's not.

359
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,387
Speaker 1: it's not Gundam where these are super-powered robots of like.

360
00:26:01,467 --> 00:26:02,430
Speaker 1: oh we got awesomeness.

361
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:03,152
Speaker 0: This is more like.

362
00:26:03,253 --> 00:26:05,941
Speaker 1: you know battle tech is slow and dumpy robots.

363
00:26:05,961 --> 00:26:13,878
Speaker 0: They go like that are huge and go kitchen like Situations like oh they busted through my left armor and blew up the ammo for my weapon.

364
00:26:13,918 --> 00:26:16,953
Speaker 0: Now my pilots hurt and Really unluckily.

365
00:26:16,973 --> 00:26:17,957
Speaker 0: I'm in a bad situation.

366
00:26:18,017 --> 00:26:29,959
Speaker 1: That's really the fun of battle tech is the stimulatory things where it's like, alright Well, I got knocked over and now falling down the hill and I took damage in this specific part and that part had ammo in It and there's a chance the ammo explodes.

367
00:26:30,401 --> 00:26:30,863
Speaker 1: it did.

368
00:26:31,164 --> 00:26:32,410
Speaker 1: All right that ammo exploded.

369
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,599
Speaker 1: How much damage does it do this much?

370
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,764
Speaker 1: what happens now?

371
00:26:35,784 --> 00:26:37,230
Speaker 1: Well, it damaged your gyro.

372
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,413
Speaker 1: It's gonna be hard to stand up.

373
00:26:38,474 --> 00:26:45,836
Speaker 1: everything just sort of makes sense in a common sense way without having to have this sort of like Esoteric military knowledge.

374
00:26:45,876 --> 00:26:49,890
Speaker 1: you would have to like, you know have those grog guard war games, which also make sense.

375
00:26:50,171 --> 00:26:50,533
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

376
00:26:50,573 --> 00:26:53,549
Speaker 1: This just makes sense because you understand a giant robot.

377
00:26:54,452 --> 00:26:58,585
Speaker 0: So I've always enjoyed it, but I don't have time to play that kind of game anymore.

378
00:26:58,645 --> 00:27:01,273
Speaker 0: or space and I have space I don't have time.

379
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:10,939
Speaker 0: and before you say like mech war whatever those all the not official or mega mech mega mech Those things are intolerable, right?

380
00:27:10,979 --> 00:27:23,034
Speaker 1: There are software versions of the tabletop game Back when I could tolerate pretty intolerable software that are free open source ish and their user interfaces are so bad They're not even worth attempt.

381
00:27:23,295 --> 00:27:25,442
Speaker 0: Even when I had infinite time.

382
00:27:25,723 --> 00:27:27,268
Speaker 0: They were not worth pursuing.

383
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:32,275
Speaker 0: Nope So battle tech got kick-started Right.

384
00:27:32,295 --> 00:27:34,430
Speaker 1: So actually I first discovered this at a PAX.

385
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:40,550
Speaker 1: I was walking around and there was a booth and the booth was like battle tech and I'm like Well, this is not the catalyst booth.

386
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:44,910
Speaker 1: Which catalyst if you don't know is the company that currently licenses and publishes.

387
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:52,883
Speaker 1: I don't know if they own but they currently publish the pen and paper Miniatures books and stuff for battle tech tabletop.

388
00:27:53,003 --> 00:27:55,855
Speaker 1: Yep, and it was not the catalyst booth But it was a battle tech booth.

389
00:27:55,895 --> 00:27:56,839
Speaker 1: and I said what is this?

390
00:27:56,899 --> 00:27:59,330
Speaker 1: and they said we are making a battle tech video game.

391
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:05,079
Speaker 1: That is the turn-based You know pen and paper miniature battle tech only a video game.

392
00:28:05,139 --> 00:28:06,983
Speaker 1: and I said shut up and take my monies.

393
00:28:07,063 --> 00:28:13,401
Speaker 1: and then I went With them at another PAX and also played the beta.

394
00:28:13,421 --> 00:28:15,850
Speaker 1: cuz I kick-started at a level where let me play the beta.

395
00:28:16,412 --> 00:28:16,753
Speaker 1: And it was.

396
00:28:16,893 --> 00:28:17,937
Speaker 1: I was so surprised.

397
00:28:18,338 --> 00:28:19,041
Speaker 1: It was legit.

398
00:28:19,061 --> 00:28:20,867
Speaker 1: Like they were actually developing this game.

399
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:21,770
Speaker 1: It wasn't some scam.

400
00:28:22,131 --> 00:28:24,180
Speaker 1: They were actually making this thing real.

401
00:28:24,421 --> 00:28:26,710
Speaker 1: They were making significant progress very rapidly.

402
00:28:26,851 --> 00:28:43,981
Speaker 1: More importantly they made it right because playing the beta what you saw was Next walk and they torso twerking shooting and torso twist is key anyway, so Now just recently like a week or two ago ish I don't know the big game has been fully released.

403
00:28:44,042 --> 00:28:46,310
Speaker 1: You can now buy whether you kick-started or not.

404
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:46,633
Speaker 1: I already.

405
00:28:46,653 --> 00:28:48,410
Speaker 1: I just got it because I already kick-started it.

406
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:51,059
Speaker 1: Yep, you can just go on steam and buy this fucking game.

407
00:28:51,601 --> 00:28:53,467
Speaker 1: It is out and a lot of people are playing it.

408
00:28:53,487 --> 00:28:55,826
Speaker 1: and Great, let's talk about it.

409
00:28:55,866 --> 00:28:56,149
Speaker 0: All right.

410
00:28:56,411 --> 00:28:57,294
Speaker 0: So first things.

411
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:58,198
Speaker 0: first there are two.

412
00:28:58,339 --> 00:29:01,030
Speaker 0: I want to get these out of the way because they're kind of topical like news wise.

413
00:29:01,572 --> 00:29:04,525
Speaker 0: There are two quote-unquote controversies about the game already.

414
00:29:04,545 --> 00:29:05,650
Speaker 1: a lot of it's weird.

415
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:08,186
Speaker 1: It's like it's there's a lot of controversies, but they're all.

416
00:29:08,387 --> 00:29:08,910
Speaker 1: there's minor.

417
00:29:09,131 --> 00:29:12,892
Speaker 1: It's like there's a lot of minor controversies and no major ones There are.

418
00:29:12,932 --> 00:29:15,744
Speaker 0: there are two that I think are relevant and newsworthy.

419
00:29:15,885 --> 00:29:19,917
Speaker 0: ish one of them The which the people are complaining about.

420
00:29:19,977 --> 00:29:24,570
Speaker 0: it are wrong in my opinion and just don't understand humans or games.

421
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:28,850
Speaker 0: But their argument is that the game shows some to hit percentages.

422
00:29:29,312 --> 00:29:37,145
Speaker 0: uh-huh, and someone proved that the actual to hit percentages are Narrower than that like the real.

423
00:29:37,186 --> 00:29:47,058
Speaker 0: the numbers they show are slightly fabricated and they actually groom the random number generator to Effectively avoid streaks a little bit.

424
00:29:47,078 --> 00:29:48,342
Speaker 1: I wouldn't just be 2d6.

425
00:29:48,482 --> 00:29:50,026
Speaker 0: It's not just 2d6.

426
00:29:50,086 --> 00:29:50,929
Speaker 1: Why is it not just 2d6?

427
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,336
Speaker 0: So you didn't see this controversy.

428
00:29:53,717 --> 00:29:57,290
Speaker 1: I did see someone saying that the percentages shown were inaccurate.

429
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:57,893
Speaker 0: They're slightly.

430
00:29:57,914 --> 00:29:58,396
Speaker 1: I did not.

431
00:29:58,437 --> 00:30:00,448
Speaker 1: I did not read the actual numbers in math.

432
00:30:00,609 --> 00:30:03,799
Speaker 0: Yeah The deal here's the real deal from.

433
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:12,630
Speaker 0: in my semi-professional opinion on this particular issue This happens a lot in games because it turns out if you tell a human they have an n-percent chance to hit something.

434
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:29,430
Speaker 0: Humans are so bad at math and so bad at statistics and so bad at patterns in this type of environment That if you say an 80% chance to hit and you actually hit 80% of the time They will perceive the 20% of the time they miss as bullshit.

435
00:30:30,052 --> 00:30:32,800
Speaker 0: They will perceive that the numbers are way off.

436
00:30:33,101 --> 00:30:34,546
Speaker 0: I mean it was a perfectly accurate.

437
00:30:34,586 --> 00:30:35,950
Speaker 1: It is bullshit, but that's battle.

438
00:30:36,474 --> 00:30:38,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's not the right kind of bullshit.

439
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:46,741
Speaker 0: all I'm saying is that when game companies fudge those kinds of numbers they're doing it because Your brain is dumb and they were tricking your brain.

440
00:30:47,002 --> 00:30:50,576
Speaker 0: and as long as you don't try to peel back that onion You'll enjoy games a lot more.

441
00:30:50,596 --> 00:30:51,439
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

442
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,205
Speaker 1: You're saying is ignorance is bliss?

443
00:30:53,606 --> 00:30:57,161
Speaker 0: in this particular case Yes, and also it's such a my one.

444
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:59,070
Speaker 0: This is not an e-sport, but I'm playing to win.

445
00:30:59,751 --> 00:31:00,695
Speaker 0: Yeah, so play to win.

446
00:31:00,715 --> 00:31:01,518
Speaker 1: How is it not an e-sport?

447
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,570
Speaker 0: This is not yet a major e-sport where it matters.

448
00:31:05,772 --> 00:31:08,407
Speaker 0: And if it came to pass, I'm gonna be Battletech world champion.

449
00:31:08,427 --> 00:31:11,477
Speaker 0: Watch out Based on our history together.

450
00:31:11,577 --> 00:31:14,188
Speaker 0: There is no chance you will ever be the Battletech champion.

451
00:31:14,228 --> 00:31:14,549
Speaker 0: Why not?

452
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:17,398
Speaker 0: 18 small lasers and no rear armor.

453
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:18,402
Speaker 1: That's just what I like.

454
00:31:18,462 --> 00:31:21,662
Speaker 1: if I have to win and the championship is on the line It's just a LRM boat.

455
00:31:21,703 --> 00:31:25,580
Speaker 1: Yeah I got a LRM boat and an SRM boat.

456
00:31:26,263 --> 00:31:27,750
Speaker 0: I was always a fan of mex 2 boat.

457
00:31:27,992 --> 00:31:33,777
Speaker 0: I've always been a fan of mex with no rear armor Like zero rear armor.

458
00:31:33,857 --> 00:31:35,785
Speaker 1: Good luck against my jump jet and then you're dead.

459
00:31:36,026 --> 00:31:37,110
Speaker 0: I'm already backed into a cliff.

460
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:37,854
Speaker 0: You can't touch me.

461
00:31:37,874 --> 00:31:39,543
Speaker 1: I can just go up on top of the mouth.

462
00:31:39,745 --> 00:31:56,270
Speaker 0: Yeah anyway, anyway, but the other controversy and I controversy I'm making the hardest quotes ever is that shitheads and gum regators are really mad at this game because It has female male and gender neutral pronouns.

463
00:31:57,152 --> 00:32:04,361
Speaker 0: They are the the internet shitstorm around that is Actually pretty big and it's I didn't see any of it.

464
00:32:04,662 --> 00:32:06,630
Speaker 0: It's all shitty people.

465
00:32:06,971 --> 00:32:08,599
Speaker 1: Anyway, well, you don't have to play battle tech.

466
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:13,449
Speaker 1: They're trying to mass boycott the game, which is great Because that means shitty people be playing battle tech.

467
00:32:13,812 --> 00:32:16,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, only if someone plays battle take that means they good.

468
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:19,010
Speaker 0: But if you see anyone complaining about that at all.

469
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:33,055
Speaker 1: And like if you see there is one thing about that that does bother me If you go and it's the character creation screen right up is if you choose he as your pronoun Yeah You get all these photos to choose from that are Stereotypically looking like dudes.

470
00:32:33,156 --> 00:32:36,285
Speaker 0: if you click enough you also get female looking ones like it didn't know.

471
00:32:36,325 --> 00:32:38,111
Speaker 1: if you choose she you get different Ones.

472
00:32:38,352 --> 00:32:38,914
Speaker 1: she's they.

473
00:32:39,014 --> 00:32:40,098
Speaker 1: you get all of them.

474
00:32:40,118 --> 00:32:43,590
Speaker 1: So it's like why can't I choose the she looking one?

475
00:32:46,211 --> 00:32:49,261
Speaker 1: Basically if you choose he or she you get half as many.

476
00:32:49,321 --> 00:32:52,090
Speaker 1: you get half of the choices for your image.

477
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,560
Speaker 1: And if you choose day, you can choose any image you want.

478
00:32:54,921 --> 00:32:56,930
Speaker 1: They should just allowed all images for all products.

479
00:32:57,652 --> 00:33:04,510
Speaker 0: But if you see anyone complaining about these options like for real those people are basically just gummer gators and they're mad.

480
00:33:04,751 --> 00:33:05,193
Speaker 1: I thought.

481
00:33:05,293 --> 00:33:10,315
Speaker 1: I thought the thing you were gonna bring up was that the game if you play single-player Which is what you're playing probably.

482
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:13,706
Speaker 1: Yeah, is that there's a lot of slowness and time losing in this game.

483
00:33:13,746 --> 00:33:15,813
Speaker 1: There are slow animations There are slow things.

484
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:16,476
Speaker 1: You got to watch.

485
00:33:16,516 --> 00:33:18,683
Speaker 1: you got to watch FMV's you got.

486
00:33:18,944 --> 00:33:27,350
Speaker 1: it's all this stuff in the game is very Time-consuming and waiting happens for no reason and the game could be sped up a lot.

487
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:33,376
Speaker 1: And the example I always bring up when people say oh no you want it You can't speed it up is even Pokemon.

488
00:33:33,437 --> 00:33:34,299
Speaker 1: lets you speed it up.

489
00:33:34,781 --> 00:33:35,663
Speaker 1: The children's game.

490
00:33:35,703 --> 00:33:37,890
Speaker 1: lets you turn off animations and do fast text.

491
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:38,188
Speaker 1: Yep.

492
00:33:38,331 --> 00:33:46,061
Speaker 1: So there is no reason that any adult game including you are stone Shouldn't allow you to turn off animations and speed everything up.

493
00:33:46,362 --> 00:33:50,619
Speaker 1: to just let you play without any visual cruft This camera zooming it.

494
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:55,809
Speaker 1: you can turn off some of it in the options menu And you can do other things by editing some files and stuff.

495
00:33:56,291 --> 00:34:02,590
Speaker 1: But it's like just let me play the battle tech without any of this garbage like zooming in and watching missiles fire.

496
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:06,445
Speaker 1: No, I want to click fire and just see a number of how much damage was done.

497
00:34:06,485 --> 00:34:12,329
Speaker 0: So counterpoint I Actually very much enjoy the slow ramp.

498
00:34:12,972 --> 00:34:16,244
Speaker 0: I actually in this game partly because battle tech.

499
00:34:16,685 --> 00:34:19,458
Speaker 0: I actually really enjoy These slow animation.

500
00:34:19,498 --> 00:34:24,141
Speaker 1: you enjoyed it one time and then I want to turn it off But I keep enjoying it because it has this interesting bit of tension.

501
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:25,889
Speaker 0: It simulates for me.

502
00:34:26,351 --> 00:34:27,135
Speaker 1: I don't got time for that.

503
00:34:27,155 --> 00:34:27,536
Speaker 1: I want to hurry.

504
00:34:27,577 --> 00:34:28,440
Speaker 0: I know I agree with you.

505
00:34:28,562 --> 00:34:41,045
Speaker 0: The option should be there but I part of the appeal I had of original classic pen and paper battle tag was Pete shoots a thousand SRMs at me because that's what Pete liked to do.

506
00:34:41,065 --> 00:34:50,130
Speaker 0: I then have to sit here and listen as He rolls 2d6 while Alex or you are looking at a book and say right center torso.

507
00:34:50,311 --> 00:34:55,228
Speaker 1: Oh, that would be fine if it like fired each weapon individually, but I get that experience.

508
00:34:55,248 --> 00:34:57,530
Speaker 1: animation No, it just makes a slow animation.

509
00:34:58,874 --> 00:35:06,467
Speaker 0: like I see the missiles come in and they actually like they'll veer off before they hit and you get that like oh They're gonna miss and a few of them hit.

510
00:35:07,212 --> 00:35:11,070
Speaker 0: You see the PPC fight the PVC scary than me the most because he had no indications.

511
00:35:11,372 --> 00:35:12,498
Speaker 1: Inner sphere garbage.

512
00:35:12,518 --> 00:35:14,669
Speaker 1: the inner PPC is like the best weapon you can get.

513
00:35:15,973 --> 00:35:18,305
Speaker 0: It is inner sphere garbage, but give them time.

514
00:35:18,426 --> 00:35:19,250
Speaker 0: It's like when sip five.

515
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:21,097
Speaker 1: I don't know why people hate clan stuff.

516
00:35:21,117 --> 00:35:22,823
Speaker 1: so much stuff is bullshit.

517
00:35:22,863 --> 00:35:23,826
Speaker 0: Why it's too.

518
00:35:23,886 --> 00:35:24,830
Speaker 0: It's op and not fun.

519
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,630
Speaker 1: What if everyone just as clan stuff was difference?

520
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:33,108
Speaker 0: That's that's the same as playing Dungeons & Dragons versus PvP with two level 20 characters.

521
00:35:33,189 --> 00:35:34,333
Speaker 0: wrong with that It ain't fun.

522
00:35:34,494 --> 00:35:34,675
Speaker 1: What's?

523
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:35,177
Speaker 1: how was that?

524
00:35:35,418 --> 00:35:38,090
Speaker 1: any less fun than fighting to one level one characters?

525
00:35:38,532 --> 00:35:41,283
Speaker 0: It's uh, it's a lot different and a lot less fun.

526
00:35:41,444 --> 00:35:42,468
Speaker 1: Why what's there ever done?

527
00:35:42,508 --> 00:35:42,890
Speaker 1: it was there.

528
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,977
Speaker 1: It's in heavyweight boxing and featherweight boxing.

529
00:35:44,997 --> 00:35:47,124
Speaker 0: They're boxing way more fun to watch.

530
00:35:47,324 --> 00:35:48,468
Speaker 1: Well, who says me?

531
00:35:48,488 --> 00:35:50,033
Speaker 1: All right Well, I don't think this.

532
00:35:50,174 --> 00:35:51,538
Speaker 1: I mean they're both equally.

533
00:35:51,558 --> 00:35:52,682
Speaker 1: they're different, but I think they're.

534
00:35:52,702 --> 00:35:56,474
Speaker 0: you got a reason why in our group No one ever.

535
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:59,064
Speaker 0: you were the only one who wanted clan ever.

536
00:35:59,245 --> 00:35:59,546
Speaker 0: Why not?

537
00:35:59,566 --> 00:36:00,650
Speaker 0: None of us wanted clan.

538
00:36:01,072 --> 00:36:04,084
Speaker 1: I like heavyweight boxing just it's obviously different but it's like.

539
00:36:04,104 --> 00:36:07,137
Speaker 1: I like it just as much as Most of the clan stuff was.

540
00:36:07,157 --> 00:36:09,386
Speaker 1: the only thing that's bullshit is intersphere verse clan.

541
00:36:09,426 --> 00:36:10,350
Speaker 1: That's obviously stupid.

542
00:36:10,531 --> 00:36:13,943
Speaker 0: Yeah, clan verse clan is a time and place what I know.

543
00:36:13,983 --> 00:36:15,409
Speaker 1: I'm not asking for intersphere verse clan.

544
00:36:15,429 --> 00:36:15,770
Speaker 1: That's dumb.

545
00:36:15,811 --> 00:36:17,009
Speaker 1: I just want to see clan verse clan.

546
00:36:17,351 --> 00:36:22,345
Speaker 1: Let me get my arrow for my ultra aces and whatnot for Gauss rifles.

547
00:36:22,626 --> 00:36:28,262
Speaker 1: my you know, triple strength My embers and you know triple strength wasn't clan that we are PvP.

548
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:30,147
Speaker 0: I just advanced intersphere.

549
00:36:30,368 --> 00:36:35,598
Speaker 1: I don't know whatever targeting computer is All the good stuff there.

550
00:36:35,638 --> 00:36:40,939
Speaker 0: I saw some screenshots of like gyros and stuff in this game Mmm, I think you can get that in the campaign.

551
00:36:41,341 --> 00:36:44,093
Speaker 0: Anyway, I have not played the game enough yet Like I like.

552
00:36:44,114 --> 00:36:45,399
Speaker 1: yeah, I have not played it enough.

553
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,031
Speaker 0: I played it a lot, but I haven't played it enough Right.

554
00:36:48,051 --> 00:36:48,794
Speaker 1: So here's the thing is like.

555
00:36:48,834 --> 00:36:54,438
Speaker 1: the game like on the one hand is so good and that yes It is tabletop battle tech.

556
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:57,632
Speaker 1: you take your turns you move your mechs you shoot, you know If you it's.

557
00:36:57,873 --> 00:37:00,204
Speaker 1: the fundamental concepts are all the same.

558
00:37:00,224 --> 00:37:03,017
Speaker 1: we take damage to areas Right areas.

559
00:37:03,077 --> 00:37:08,078
Speaker 1: your arm falls off you can walk up to someone and melee them You can step on a vehicle and it gets destroyed.

560
00:37:08,118 --> 00:37:14,361
Speaker 1: the fact that DFA is there like DFA real easy Like, you know all the weapons, you know work the same.

561
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:19,610
Speaker 1: you can have someone's spot for your LRM fire You can you know you get a cover if you're in the woods.

562
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:22,654
Speaker 0: In fact, my only complaint about the game I only like mechanical.

563
00:37:22,694 --> 00:37:27,790
Speaker 0: complaint about this game is that they implemented this hardpoint system and met customization.

564
00:37:28,011 --> 00:37:28,814
Speaker 1: Oh that I don't like.

565
00:37:28,834 --> 00:37:29,636
Speaker 1: that is actually.

566
00:37:29,656 --> 00:37:52,540
Speaker 1: there are many things that they've changed from the actual tabletop rules but a lot of the things they've changed are functionally equivalent or similar enough for like the exact roles and math for like falling over aren't exactly the same but it's effectively the same kind of thing where it's like yeah, if you moved a lot and then you get bumped a lot then your odds Of falling over increase and then you fall over,

567
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,886
Speaker 0: you know, you've moved a lot.

568
00:37:53,906 --> 00:37:54,830
Speaker 0: So you're harder to hit.

569
00:37:54,911 --> 00:37:56,783
Speaker 0: It's a much it's a very in the woods.

570
00:37:56,844 --> 00:37:57,710
Speaker 1: It's harder to hit you.

571
00:37:57,931 --> 00:38:03,710
Speaker 0: It's harder to hit and the game is a really good job of really streamlining the heuristics and indicators and artifacts around that.

572
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:12,404
Speaker 0: So like the further your guy moves and depending on the things that happen It'll show these little chevrons that show how much evasion you accumulated.

573
00:38:12,444 --> 00:38:12,605
Speaker 0: It's not.

574
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,350
Speaker 0: it's a really intuitive system, right?

575
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:18,310
Speaker 1: There's not just piloting skill and gunning skill which would used to be just like two numbers.

576
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:26,278
Speaker 1: Yeah now like four different stats that like grit and something else and like you can Level up your characters and to like get different.

577
00:38:26,539 --> 00:38:29,309
Speaker 0: you never played battle tech as a campaign though.

578
00:38:29,329 --> 00:38:29,630
Speaker 1: That's well.

579
00:38:29,771 --> 00:38:31,450
Speaker 1: No, that's messy mech warrior.

580
00:38:31,492 --> 00:38:42,588
Speaker 1: Yeah the RPG has some of that stuff but battle tech as a campaign is Basically just playing the battle tech tabletop game that we played But linking the missions together and having money.

581
00:38:42,608 --> 00:38:46,121
Speaker 1: now The other thing that is missing and having a store and having a story is.

582
00:38:46,362 --> 00:38:54,929
Speaker 0: there's a deeper level of fiddly mech Customization that is not present and that is the things like what engine did you put in the Mac, right?

583
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:55,973
Speaker 1: So they don't allow.

584
00:38:55,993 --> 00:39:02,637
Speaker 1: they only allow customizing the mech to the way that mech warrior 2 allowed customizing the mech But actually even more restrictive.

585
00:39:02,999 --> 00:39:05,690
Speaker 1: because what they've done is like rim was saying they these hard points.

586
00:39:05,851 --> 00:39:11,330
Speaker 1: So usually in mech warrior 2 or in battle tech on pen and paper You could just you have these slots on the Mac.

587
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:17,399
Speaker 1: You have a lot of them and you can put whatever you want in there that you can fit Without running out of slots or running out of weight.

588
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:20,310
Speaker 1: in this one the mechs have these hard points.

589
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:21,059
Speaker 1: So it's like okay.

590
00:39:21,201 --> 00:39:29,480
Speaker 1: on this mech The left torso can hold one missile weapon and the right torso can hold two Ballistic weapons and the arms can hold two lasers.

591
00:39:29,561 --> 00:39:31,850
Speaker 1: each or each Mac has like a different loadout.

592
00:39:32,112 --> 00:39:34,692
Speaker 0: I wouldn't even be that butter about it If it.

593
00:39:34,933 --> 00:39:40,199
Speaker 0: if it was if they were like there were a mix that a lot of hard points It was just the next have so few hard points.

594
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:43,190
Speaker 1: You basically cannot customize much at all.

595
00:39:43,291 --> 00:39:44,525
Speaker 1: You just need to get a different Mac.

596
00:39:44,687 --> 00:39:50,270
Speaker 1: Yep Also, they're the way the game is structured which is a truth of battle tech.

597
00:39:50,411 --> 00:39:52,039
Speaker 1: But is they tried this?

598
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:55,195
Speaker 1: I think the hard points were an attempt to solve this problem But didn't solve it.

599
00:39:55,255 --> 00:39:57,809
Speaker 1: is that it's just better to field heavier max?

600
00:39:58,385 --> 00:40:04,955
Speaker 1: Yeah You're better off just putting the four heaviest mechs you can out in the field loaded with the most stuff Yep, and the LRMs are just better.

601
00:40:05,176 --> 00:40:09,790
Speaker 0: like 180 ton Mac can kick the shit out of 250 or 60 ton max usually.

602
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:13,245
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean in battle tech the pen and paper your game without the hard points.

603
00:40:13,386 --> 00:40:21,359
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, it's true Every hundred ton Mac may as well be the same as every other hundred ton Mac But I could make a 30 ton Mac.

604
00:40:21,379 --> 00:40:24,410
Speaker 0: That was really fucking dangerous in the right circumstances.

605
00:40:24,651 --> 00:40:28,089
Speaker 1: Sure, you know you look at your mission situation you make the right kind of deal, but that's it.

606
00:40:28,372 --> 00:40:37,673
Speaker 0: This is this is where in the campaign Different tonnages have interesting uses and I actually feel like a light Mac that I set up to be a scout And I've done things.

607
00:40:38,155 --> 00:40:43,513
Speaker 0: but in the in multiplayer, which is my main interest in this battle tech game There aren't.

608
00:40:43,734 --> 00:40:48,590
Speaker 0: there isn't yet like a scenario builder, so it just comes down to what's the tonnage?

609
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:53,947
Speaker 0: We're gonna play with and we both field lances of appropriate tonnage, and it's and they're like.

610
00:40:53,987 --> 00:40:55,030
Speaker 0: I can't make a scenario.

611
00:40:55,130 --> 00:41:00,969
Speaker 0: There's no like customizer there yet, which in multiplayer can lead to a problem where?

612
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:06,290
Speaker 0: And when Scott and I played for the first time the same thing that used to happen in our old battle tech days happen.

613
00:41:07,033 --> 00:41:15,090
Speaker 0: We both set up our max in an optimal ambush position And then dickered around for like 20 minutes and neither one of us would commit our forces anywhere.

614
00:41:15,653 --> 00:41:17,242
Speaker 0: Till eventually we were just like fuck it.

615
00:41:17,262 --> 00:41:18,248
Speaker 0: Let's just play the game.

616
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:21,074
Speaker 0: I Want to be able to build scenarios.

617
00:41:21,094 --> 00:41:26,470
Speaker 0: I want to be able to build like or at least have scenarios that are more interesting for multiplayer.

618
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:30,841
Speaker 1: So the thing is this game for all its you know.

619
00:41:31,001 --> 00:41:34,234
Speaker 1: hey, I can now play a video game But it's battle tech.

620
00:41:34,314 --> 00:41:42,750
Speaker 1: the turn-based game hooray has lots and lots of these tiny Issues that you can see complained about on the subreddit for this game and many other place.

621
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:56,195
Speaker 0: But what I would analogize this to actually is when Civ 5 first came out It was real fun for like a month, and then it was tapped out and had a similar Breadth of problems.

622
00:41:56,335 --> 00:41:58,401
Speaker 1: yeah, so this has tons and tons of tiny issues.

623
00:41:58,441 --> 00:42:01,450
Speaker 1: for example some today the one I saw most recently.

624
00:42:01,792 --> 00:42:03,421
Speaker 1: There was a mech standing on top of a building.

625
00:42:03,984 --> 00:42:07,722
Speaker 1: somebody decided Hey Let me destroy this building and they destroyed it.

626
00:42:08,043 --> 00:42:11,598
Speaker 1: the mech was then floating in air And then the mech was then standing on the ground.

627
00:42:11,638 --> 00:42:12,340
Speaker 1: perfectly fine.

628
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:18,950
Speaker 1: in pen and paper battle tech you take falling damage Which is severe as fuck and holy shit, but in this video game?

629
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:21,201
Speaker 0: We just like nothing pointed out in the campaign.

630
00:42:21,543 --> 00:42:24,643
Speaker 0: they moved a mech into a spot And then an event happened, and they were hosed.

631
00:42:24,683 --> 00:42:25,530
Speaker 0: they just couldn't continue.

632
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:27,981
Speaker 1: Yeah, little bugs there was some like there's.

633
00:42:28,021 --> 00:42:29,147
Speaker 1: some missions were like.

634
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:30,974
Speaker 1: you know vehicles Go too fast.

635
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:35,797
Speaker 1: there's some like missions where you go in and there's just a million enemies that are super strong And it's like fuck you.

636
00:42:35,817 --> 00:42:36,402
Speaker 1: so you might as well.

637
00:42:36,423 --> 00:42:37,230
Speaker 1: Just run away.

638
00:42:38,812 --> 00:42:40,318
Speaker 1: You know there's like tons of like.

639
00:42:40,358 --> 00:42:41,743
Speaker 1: you know I could go on and on.

640
00:42:41,763 --> 00:42:43,710
Speaker 1: there's just you know the user interface problems.

641
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:47,470
Speaker 1: We're like you're trying to click on a thing, but actually you've moved your mech by accident.

642
00:42:48,931 --> 00:42:51,179
Speaker 0: It's hard to get the angle of my view just right.

643
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:52,966
Speaker 1: some you have the camera is not the greatest.

644
00:42:53,026 --> 00:42:54,576
Speaker 1: also the a lot of The maps.

645
00:42:54,616 --> 00:42:57,416
Speaker 1: everything is dark And it's hard to see what's going on.

646
00:42:57,717 --> 00:43:01,250
Speaker 1: the mechs don't look distinct enough because they're sort of blending into the background.

647
00:43:01,653 --> 00:43:04,209
Speaker 1: They're camo you know so it's like it's hard to even see.

648
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:05,774
Speaker 0: But I just want to be clear.

649
00:43:06,457 --> 00:43:10,529
Speaker 0: the game's still real fun and as a 1.0 like a released game.

650
00:43:10,549 --> 00:43:15,677
Speaker 0: if This if they're able to invest in this game I mean the fact the game actually launched.

651
00:43:15,697 --> 00:43:17,202
Speaker 1: kick-starting games is like usually.

652
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:18,788
Speaker 1: it's just like they run away with your fucking money.

653
00:43:19,109 --> 00:43:36,226
Speaker 0: if this game gets DLC Over time even in DLC expensive DLC even free clan DLC even just guy like I'm talking like the civilization levels of DLC I Would buy it all.

654
00:43:38,053 --> 00:43:39,258
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the thing.

655
00:43:39,298 --> 00:43:42,430
Speaker 0: you'll see that adds like the advanced tech so I can have my Gauss rifle.

656
00:43:43,093 --> 00:43:47,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, my main problem is like I played the single-player and like the campaign.

657
00:43:47,672 --> 00:43:50,290
Speaker 1: There's lots of stuff like you get a manage the mechs in the mech bay.

658
00:43:50,531 --> 00:43:53,302
Speaker 0: It's real fun because it evokes old xcom.

659
00:43:53,783 --> 00:43:54,165
Speaker 0: well.

660
00:43:54,205 --> 00:43:55,490
Speaker 1: It's from mech warrior mercenaries.

661
00:43:55,490 --> 00:44:01,805
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're managing your money, and I really enjoy that because shit sucks your things are always broken down Everyone's always hurt.

662
00:44:01,886 --> 00:44:02,130
Speaker 0: you're like.

663
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:10,725
Speaker 1: But the thing is there's a lot of fiddly issues like I'm trying to allocate tons of armor on my mech And it's like forty nine point seven seven and it won't let me make it exactly fifty.

664
00:44:10,766 --> 00:44:11,970
Speaker 1: and then I go to start a mission.

665
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:15,664
Speaker 1: It's like warning you're not using all the tonnage on your mech, and I'm like who's fucking fault is that?

666
00:44:15,764 --> 00:44:17,614
Speaker 1: forty nine point nine nine ton?

667
00:44:17,795 --> 00:44:23,289
Speaker 0: asshole granted right Making mechs repeatedly on pen and paper at similar issues.

668
00:44:24,112 --> 00:44:31,549
Speaker 0: I never had an issue of point oh one tons missing, but I had issues of little fiddly details like that And usually we just ignored them, so it didn't matter.

669
00:44:32,581 --> 00:44:40,300
Speaker 1: But yeah You know there's this Problems like you've got to repair a mech and it cost more on if you do it from one screen on the other screen and Oh, yeah, and you gotta wait.

670
00:44:40,481 --> 00:44:42,419
Speaker 1: You know for the mech to actually repairs That's it.

671
00:44:43,791 --> 00:44:48,990
Speaker 0: There's definitely some problems now in the the economy of how long on the one screen.

672
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:50,458
Speaker 1: It's like how much of the salvage worked.

673
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:52,590
Speaker 1: oh like three million space bucks.

674
00:44:52,671 --> 00:44:53,989
Speaker 1: And then you go to the screen to sell it.

675
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:57,310
Speaker 1: It's like you can't sell it, and then it's like it's not actually worth jack shit.

676
00:44:57,350 --> 00:44:59,129
Speaker 0: It's like what the hell because you got to finish it.

677
00:44:59,250 --> 00:44:59,933
Speaker 0: It's not like stay.

678
00:44:59,953 --> 00:45:06,681
Speaker 1: why can't I sell that if a piece of a mech is worth that much and then when I do finish it The full mech is worth less than the it said the part was worth.

679
00:45:06,701 --> 00:45:09,673
Speaker 1: You know and they got this reputation system Confused

680
00:45:09,694 --> 00:45:21,549
Speaker 0: but also it's sparse in that head like it's fun, but You do end up just hitting play and letting like 40 days go by Because you're waiting for like all your mechs to repair and stuff like

681
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:23,908
Speaker 1: yeah Why would I do the next mission before my mixer repair?

682
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:24,029
Speaker 0: yep?

683
00:45:24,431 --> 00:45:28,147
Speaker 0: So the economy of action in the single-player campaign type.

684
00:45:28,207 --> 00:45:33,695
Speaker 1: you're starting everyone There's scarters starting scout dies, so I'm like my starting scout guy didn't die I'm doing died.

685
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:35,725
Speaker 1: I go to the subreddit and everyone's like Decker.

686
00:45:35,765 --> 00:45:36,630
Speaker 1: He always dies.

687
00:45:36,911 --> 00:45:39,480
Speaker 0: I don't know how they could have him die.

688
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:49,167
Speaker 1: I like blew through that mission, and then I immediately do well No, I mean he's your scouting guy for like the whole many yeah for the beginning of the game You just keep him around right and then the next mission.

689
00:45:49,227 --> 00:45:49,549
Speaker 1: I did.

690
00:45:50,673 --> 00:45:51,198
Speaker 1: He just got.

691
00:45:51,299 --> 00:45:51,904
Speaker 1: he was perfect.

692
00:45:51,965 --> 00:45:52,530
Speaker 1: perfect health.

693
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:53,434
Speaker 1: He hadn't been hit yet.

694
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:57,230
Speaker 1: a mech just walks over to him comes out of the fog and fires like a million.

695
00:45:57,351 --> 00:45:59,520
Speaker 1: He dies instantly, but that is battle tech.

696
00:45:59,701 --> 00:46:01,729
Speaker 1: right, but then I loaded the game so he didn't die.

697
00:46:02,652 --> 00:46:04,802
Speaker 1: But everyone else is like this guy keeps dying.

698
00:46:04,863 --> 00:46:06,330
Speaker 0: I'm playing hardcore in all consequences.

699
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:07,458
Speaker 0: I never back out of a fight.

700
00:46:07,719 --> 00:46:07,941
Speaker 1: Well.

701
00:46:07,981 --> 00:46:09,250
Speaker 1: I mean why not load a save game?

702
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:12,464
Speaker 1: Oh, also if you have too many save games the game starts to slow down.

703
00:46:12,484 --> 00:46:13,590
Speaker 1: You have to delete your save games.

704
00:46:14,892 --> 00:46:19,162
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Basically, I got you know I played the single-player until I was like.

705
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:20,809
Speaker 1: some of the missions are so samey.

706
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:24,990
Speaker 1: That's where I feel like I don't care about the plot enough to see the rest of it.

707
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:25,941
Speaker 1: I could watch it on YouTube.

708
00:46:25,961 --> 00:46:29,690
Speaker 1: so now I'm pretty much just only waiting for like people who want to play multiplayer.

709
00:46:29,931 --> 00:46:34,073
Speaker 1: But I feel like that's where the sweet spot is gonna be kind of like Civ 5.

710
00:46:34,073 --> 00:46:35,890
Speaker 0: The sweet spot is multiplayer.

711
00:46:36,931 --> 00:46:48,730
Speaker 0: until there's a DLC that adds something to the game and that as long as they do continue to invest in this game and release Content and improve it then there will definitely be a cycle of play the game with people in multiplayer.

712
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:53,550
Speaker 0: It starts to get tapped out some content comes in we jump back on the single-player train.

713
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:57,819
Speaker 1: You know whenever we're in a battle tech mood We can actually play a battle tech now without having to bust.

714
00:46:57,859 --> 00:46:59,324
Speaker 0: so I would say cardboard.

715
00:46:59,464 --> 00:47:12,699
Speaker 0: if you are in the situation We're in where you have fond memories of old pen and paper battle tech But don't have time to play it buy this game The even if you only play the campaign and play it multiplayer a few times It'll scratch that if you're

716
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,750
Speaker 1: expecting the exact same rules.

717
00:47:15,151 --> 00:47:16,456
Speaker 1: This is not that for exam.

718
00:47:16,476 --> 00:47:19,769
Speaker 0: you know like I never 100% knew the rules back then.

719
00:47:19,869 --> 00:47:22,073
Speaker 1: anyway I know I know the rules But how to present?

720
00:47:22,134 --> 00:47:29,770
Speaker 1: for example the biggest rule change is that in paid pen and paper battle tech right everyone moves Then everyone shoots, and you all shoot simultaneously.

721
00:47:29,951 --> 00:47:31,255
Speaker 1: So I get a headshot on rim.

722
00:47:31,556 --> 00:47:45,040
Speaker 1: He still might get a headshot on me before he dies right whereas in this There's initiatives more like X come so the fast makes go first unless they delay And then the next Mexico and they move shoot move shoot Which is more what you're used to in a turn-based strategy video game.

723
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:45,923
Speaker 1: right like advance wars.

724
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:47,047
Speaker 1: move shoot move shoot right.

725
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:53,290
Speaker 1: so In that sense you could just like destroy a mech before it even gets a chance to do anything if you get lucky right?

726
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:54,776
Speaker 1: Yeah, which is not the same.

727
00:47:54,937 --> 00:47:56,725
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, you go with that on purpose.

728
00:47:56,746 --> 00:47:57,690
Speaker 0: You set up stress.

729
00:47:58,813 --> 00:48:00,570
Speaker 1: It's fine right there's nothing wrong with it.

730
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:04,185
Speaker 1: I'm just saying if you're expecting it to be exactly the same it is not.

731
00:48:04,325 --> 00:48:07,289
Speaker 1: it is just the same Feel and mostly the same.

732
00:48:07,672 --> 00:48:19,450
Speaker 0: But I would also say if you're gonna get into it for the multiplayer Get in on it now because our crew the front row crew and geek guides forums We're gonna try to get a bunch of multiplayer going as long as the iron is hot.

733
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:22,380
Speaker 1: The only thing I can say is that like there's all these PC games now.

734
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:28,870
Speaker 1: It's still PC game season yet the game I still play the most display the fire especially since they got a new character.

735
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:29,955
Speaker 1: And it's like I played.

736
00:48:29,975 --> 00:48:36,029
Speaker 1: I played the what was the other way into the breach like for a day I really liked into the brain liked it so much.

737
00:48:36,391 --> 00:48:40,190
Speaker 1: It's nothing wrong with it, but then I you know and I played battle tech for like a few days.

738
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:41,939
Speaker 0: But slay the spire just scratch.

739
00:48:41,959 --> 00:48:43,990
Speaker 1: I just played slay the spire every day.

740
00:48:44,071 --> 00:48:46,850
Speaker 0: I still place play the spy every day at least for now.

741
00:48:47,051 --> 00:48:48,517
Speaker 0: I play this almost like this.

742
00:48:48,598 --> 00:48:51,270
Speaker 0: scratch is a really profound itch, and I'm playing it a lot.

743
00:48:51,392 --> 00:48:52,509
Speaker 1: I just don't play it every day.

744
00:48:52,611 --> 00:48:53,547
Speaker 1: They just play it you know.

745
00:48:53,893 --> 00:49:00,150
Speaker 1: But I feel like once I get doing multiplayer with our friends and it's like if I already played slay the spire that day and I'm bored and I got nothing to do.

746
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:01,837
Speaker 1: Then I plan to open battle tech.
