1
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,000
Speaker 2: Yeah, or it be Tuesday, September the 19th, and this be Geek Nights.

2
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,120
Speaker 2: Tonight on this fabulous talk-lucky-pirates day, we be talkin' about the video game called Pirates.

3
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:39,970
Speaker 2: Ah, or it be a glorious day, the highest of pirate holidays.

4
00:00:41,111 --> 00:00:43,690
Speaker 3: Indeed, there was much booty gathering.

5
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,430
Speaker 2: Yes, me co-workers not be believin' in the pirate's creed.

6
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:48,988
Speaker 2: I done slain them all.

7
00:00:49,652 --> 00:00:53,689
Speaker 3: I not be having co-workers, for I have mutinied and killed a lot of 'em.

8
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:59,046
Speaker 2: Though, though today's episode will be quite authentic, for I, Rim, a.k.a.

9
00:00:59,146 --> 00:01:02,526
Speaker 2: DJ Plunder, have made actual grog.

10
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:07,924
Speaker 1: I'm drinking it currently from Puss's rum, the rum that was used by the actual British Navy.

11
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:12,089
Speaker 3: I have already drunken all of the rum aboard me ship.

12
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:13,090
Speaker 2: Ye have not a ship.

13
00:01:13,252 --> 00:01:14,990
Speaker 2: I am not with only cannonballs.

14
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,450
Speaker 2: Ye have not a ship, and ye have not any rum.

15
00:01:17,851 --> 00:01:23,350
Speaker 2: But anyway, as the episode be progressin', me be gettin' more and more piratey in me intoxication.

16
00:01:25,011 --> 00:01:29,750
Speaker 3: Aye, so let us, uh, make haste and progress with our pirate podcast.

17
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:35,550
Speaker 2: Ye be knowin', I note that even in a pirate's tongue, ye still say the ums and likes.

18
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,889
Speaker 3: Pirates are known for their arms and arlikes.

19
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:40,815
Speaker 1: Arrr.

20
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:42,246
Speaker 0: Aye.

21
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:47,670
Speaker 2: Yarr, so Nintendo be makin' vast strides against ye mighty pirates.

22
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,009
Speaker 2: They be region locking the wee.

23
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:52,510
Speaker 3: Region locking?

24
00:01:53,271 --> 00:02:00,428
Speaker 3: So when I am pirating their games from Muslim ships of gold, I cannot be playing them in the Caribbean.

25
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,729
Speaker 2: Nay, we be needin' modder chips.

26
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:10,749
Speaker 2: So I be wonderin' why Nintendo be doin' such a dastardly thing to ye noble pirates, and I've got a few ideas.

27
00:02:11,691 --> 00:02:20,409
Speaker 2: A, it seems that Nintendo wishes to look over the Europeans who do not buy the video games so much, and they do not be carin' about the market there.

28
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:36,870
Speaker 2: And B, it seems that they always be afraid of piracy, as they had much resisted the use of the... And B, they had very much disliked us pirates, and they had been using whatever forces they had to prevent our piracy.

29
00:02:37,432 --> 00:02:43,008
Speaker 2: Such things as not wanting to go to easily copyable discs, and thus causing the N64 to sail.

30
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:43,866
Speaker 1: Fail.

31
00:02:45,712 --> 00:02:53,529
Speaker 2: And of course, arr, there be the differences between PAL and the NTSC, which means that region coding might just be a bi-productar.

32
00:02:54,611 --> 00:03:12,530
Speaker 3: Aye, well, Nintendo be from the land of Japan, where there are many ninjas, the mortal enemies of pirates, so it is no... So it is not unexpected that they would impose region locks to thwart piracy.

33
00:03:14,191 --> 00:03:17,230
Speaker 2: So, be ye heaven and news, ye scurvy dog.

34
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:23,210
Speaker 3: Aye, well, the very same Nintendo and their new console, the Wii.

35
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,290
Speaker 2: The arrr evolution.

36
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:34,150
Speaker 3: Aye, there be many pre-orders available from Amazon and the Nintendo World Store.

37
00:03:34,351 --> 00:03:36,944
Speaker 0: However, they are now sold out.

38
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,967
Speaker 2: That be a strong grog I be drinkin'.

39
00:03:41,592 --> 00:03:45,029
Speaker 2: Well, at least ye be getting your pre-order in at the actual home.

40
00:03:45,750 --> 00:04:03,610
Speaker 3: Aye, and the rumor be that the reason pre-orders are no longer available, be that they want to make sure that anyone who already has a pre-order is guaranteed to get a system, for they do not know just how many those blasted ninjas will bring over the ocean.

41
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:09,570
Speaker 3: And they do not know how many I will plunder from their ships as they cross the Pacific.

42
00:04:10,071 --> 00:04:11,266
Speaker 2: Aye, a free booter ye be.

43
00:04:12,093 --> 00:04:12,524
Speaker 3: That we be.

44
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:27,626
Speaker 2: Now, of course, before we be making to the things of the day, arrr, ye must be knowing that it is mighty difficult to speak like a pirate, and thus, if ye be having difficulty on this holiest of days, I suggest ye be following the link in our show

45
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:27,927
Speaker 1: notes,

46
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:31,290
Speaker 2: which shall be describing the mighty ways of speaking like a pirate.

47
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:33,750
Speaker 0: What do you do with a drunken sailor?

48
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,490
Speaker 1: What do you do with a drunken sailor?

49
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,270
Speaker 1: What do you do with a drunken sailor?

50
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,646
Speaker 2: I lie in the mornin'.

51
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:46,307
Speaker 2: Now, as ye be knowin', a pirate's life is mighty short, but we have many hobbies and things that we love to do and we not be plunderin'.

52
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,650
Speaker 2: Perhaps the greatest thing a pirate can ever do is enjoy a good game of hockey.

53
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:54,150
Speaker 3: And what is great about a game of hockey?

54
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,530
Speaker 3: Why do pirates enjoy this sport today?

55
00:04:56,732 --> 00:04:58,330
Speaker 3: Is it because they enjoy the cold?

56
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:58,835
Speaker 3: No.

57
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,830
Speaker 3: Is it because they enjoy nets and pucks and sticks?

58
00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:02,204
Speaker 0: No.

59
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,042
Speaker 2: It is because we enjoy plunderin'.

60
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,030
Speaker 3: There ain't be any plunderin' in hockey.

61
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,906
Speaker 2: Ye there be.

62
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,658
Speaker 2: We be takin' that silver cup.

63
00:05:09,698 --> 00:05:11,710
Speaker 2: they be tossin' back and forth that ice.

64
00:05:12,653 --> 00:05:14,310
Speaker 3: Ah, yeah.

65
00:05:18,711 --> 00:05:23,850
Speaker 3: Nay, the reason pirates love the game of hockey is because it involves much brawling.

66
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:29,808
Speaker 2: Well then, I be beginning a mutiny against a Scot here, for yesterday.

67
00:05:29,848 --> 00:05:34,510
Speaker 2: I remember that he had made a thing of the day that was about a hockey player who was knocked out.

68
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:40,209
Speaker 2: I now have a video of at least a hundred hockey players all being knocked out.

69
00:05:41,131 --> 00:05:42,649
Speaker 3: Aye, were they knocked out by pirates?

70
00:05:43,631 --> 00:05:44,568
Speaker 2: Ah, yes.

71
00:05:45,817 --> 00:05:46,086
Speaker 0: No.

72
00:05:47,153 --> 00:05:47,970
Speaker 2: Not at all.

73
00:05:49,476 --> 00:05:49,746
Speaker 3: Yes.

74
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:54,290
Speaker 2: Pirates not be carin' about ye petty semantic arguments and logic.

75
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,469
Speaker 2: Pirates be carin' about the knockouts.

76
00:05:58,138 --> 00:05:58,750
Speaker 2: And the gold.

77
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,270
Speaker 3: Were they knocked out by gold?

78
00:06:03,911 --> 00:06:08,090
Speaker 3: Arr, my thing of the day actually involves pirates playing hockey.

79
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,410
Speaker 2: Ye thing of the day be nothing, ye be not a pirate, ye be but a scurvy dog.

80
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:27,530
Speaker 3: Nay, only scurvy dogs be the Providence Bruins who dared to play hockey against the mighty Portland Pirates in a game of ice hockey in the year of 1993, or 1994.

81
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:36,530
Speaker 2: It be a little known fact that no hockey team had ever defeated the Pirates, for whenever they tried to score a goal, we simply shot them with our cannons.

82
00:06:37,991 --> 00:06:51,750
Speaker 3: Aye, but at this game, we were sadly absent, for there was much booty to be gathering across the town, and the Portland Pirates and the Providence Bruins had a mighty brawl which rocked the entire arena.

83
00:06:52,577 --> 00:06:52,702
Speaker 0: Arr!

84
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,527
Speaker 2: I think we be tonin' down the pirate.

85
00:06:56,547 --> 00:06:57,070
Speaker 1: talk a bit.

86
00:06:59,174 --> 00:07:00,129
Speaker 2: It cannot be done.

87
00:07:01,871 --> 00:07:03,448
Speaker 3: What kind of pirate are ye?

88
00:07:04,152 --> 00:07:06,029
Speaker 2: I be a pirate who has had too much grog.

89
00:07:07,733 --> 00:07:09,290
Speaker 3: And that is a fine pirate.

90
00:07:09,751 --> 00:07:11,030
Speaker 0: There is no other kind.

91
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:14,229
Speaker 2: Fine, perhaps I am the captain of the ship that goes off to fight the pirates.

92
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,310
Speaker 3: Then blast ye with this cannon.

93
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:21,380
Speaker 1: Right.

94
00:07:24,046 --> 00:07:25,460
Speaker 1: I don't think we can do this anymore.

95
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,876
Speaker 3: Arr ye be a wuss.

96
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:27,647
Speaker 1: May!

97
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:32,880
Speaker 3: I'm you, Ginny.

98
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:50,100
Speaker 1: I think at this point our listeners need to know that we have cut out about 50% of this episode, which consisted of nothing more than us laughing hysterically, and I don't know if there's actually any continuity in what we've said for the past 10 minutes.

99
00:07:50,642 --> 00:07:52,860
Speaker 0: I don't know, did anyone get that at all?

100
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:55,280
Speaker 1: I could barely understand what I was saying.

101
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,500
Speaker 1: I mean, it's one thing to talk like a pirate.

102
00:07:57,921 --> 00:08:02,000
Speaker 1: It's another thing to try to talk like a pirate about things that aren't very piratey at all.

103
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,518
Speaker 0: Like video games?

104
00:08:04,301 --> 00:08:11,860
Speaker 1: And also the fact that we'd talk for about a minute, we'd crack up, we'd cut that out, we'd forget what we were talking about, and then we'd pick up where we left off.

105
00:08:12,682 --> 00:08:14,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, but hey.

106
00:08:15,221 --> 00:08:17,200
Speaker 0: You gotta observe the holidays, you know what I mean?

107
00:08:17,601 --> 00:08:18,079
Speaker 0: What you gonna do?

108
00:08:18,824 --> 00:08:19,540
Speaker 1: Talk like a pirate.

109
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,338
Speaker 0: That's right.

110
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,100
Speaker 3: That's right!

111
00:08:21,946 --> 00:08:22,030
Speaker 1: Arr.

112
00:08:23,032 --> 00:08:23,178
Speaker 1: Anyway.

113
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:30,080
Speaker 1: Now anyway, the truth is that I have indeed been drinking actual grog throughout this entire episode.

114
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:36,299
Speaker 1: All I have to say about grog is that it tastes really good, but it burns when it goes down.

115
00:08:36,561 --> 00:08:43,389
Speaker 0: Yeah, he made the grog by combining water, lemon juice, and sugar, which is lemonade, and rum.

116
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,179
Speaker 1: Not just rum.

117
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,854
Speaker 1: Normal rum is not 100 proof.

118
00:08:47,581 --> 00:08:48,260
Speaker 1: This is Pusser's rum.

119
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,137
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're not talking about Captain Morgan, that piece of...

120
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,400
Speaker 3: Arr, that scurvy dog, Captain Morgan is sending a Davy Jones locker.

121
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,760
Speaker 1: No, this is actual British Navy rum.

122
00:08:58,563 --> 00:08:59,197
Speaker 3: Pusser's rum.

123
00:09:00,021 --> 00:09:01,599
Speaker 3: The finest rum on the sea.

124
00:09:02,604 --> 00:09:03,659
Speaker 1: Actually, it's pretty rank.

125
00:09:03,981 --> 00:09:04,392
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is.

126
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,300
Speaker 1: I couldn't drink this up.

127
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,419
Speaker 0: It's basically concentrated poison.

128
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,293
Speaker 1: Good guy.

129
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, you tried a teaspoon of it at one point.

130
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,199
Speaker 0: Good guy.

131
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,199
Speaker 1: It tastes like poison.

132
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,616
Speaker 0: It is poison.

133
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,500
Speaker 3: But, Arr, that's what pirates be drinking.

134
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,898
Speaker 1: I've drunk maybe a hundredth of this bottle since I bought it.

135
00:09:23,426 --> 00:09:24,259
Speaker 0: Was it worth buying it?

136
00:09:24,744 --> 00:09:25,257
Speaker 1: I'd say so.

137
00:09:25,545 --> 00:09:25,859
Speaker 1: Okay.

138
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:26,519
Speaker 1: Just for today.

139
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,820
Speaker 1: Just so I could actually drink grog and talk like a pirate day.

140
00:09:30,225 --> 00:09:30,499
Speaker 0: Alright.

141
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:39,640
Speaker 1: Anyway, talk like a pirate day is awesome, but I don't know if you guys actually would want to listen to us try to talk about a game like pirates.

142
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:45,940
Speaker 0: I don't know, it's pretty hard on our throats, but I'm sure everyone else would get a big kick out of it if we managed.

143
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,120
Speaker 1: See, the thing is, we have often lapsed into these sorts of pseudo-languages in the past.

144
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,760
Speaker 1: We'll probably do a whole show on this topic at some point.

145
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:58,440
Speaker 1: But there was a time in RIT when for some reason we started speaking like cavemen.

146
00:09:58,781 --> 00:09:59,700
Speaker 1: Not pirates, but cavemen.

147
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:05,395
Speaker 0: Well, that was because you were playing Settlers of Catan, and when you play Settlers of Catan, you say things like, "Ooh, wood for

148
00:10:05,456 --> 00:10:05,658
Speaker 0: sheep.".

149
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,215
Speaker 2: "Ooh, wood give or

150
00:10:07,295 --> 00:10:07,700
Speaker 2: smash.".

151
00:10:10,062 --> 00:10:13,117
Speaker 3: "I build a road, you give brick, I give two

152
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:13,559
Speaker 3: rocks.".

153
00:10:14,561 --> 00:10:25,298
Speaker 1: So, we started doing that in other games, and then one day we started doing it in our daily lives, and it got to the point where we actually had a little bit of trouble speaking normally.

154
00:10:27,283 --> 00:10:34,200
Speaker 0: When I raised my hand in class, I wouldn't talk like a caveman, but whenever we were around with the crew, everyone would go to caveman talk.

155
00:10:35,621 --> 00:10:43,351
Speaker 1: We'd go to a restaurant, and I'd almost say something like, "Chilly be be wanting," or, "Chilly be give do, eat

156
00:10:44,315 --> 00:10:44,636
Speaker 1: will.".

157
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,900
Speaker 0: Isn't it funny how cave talk is pretty close to pirate talk?

158
00:10:49,221 --> 00:10:50,360
Speaker 1: It's also pretty close to Hebrew.

159
00:10:50,741 --> 00:10:59,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I think it's just that the Hebrew language, if you try to translate it directly to English, is they don't have a lot of, at least modern Hebrew.

160
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,360
Speaker 1: The amenities of modern language.

161
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,054
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it translates a lot like cave talk, so if you want to say, "Who is

162
00:11:05,074 --> 00:11:05,154
Speaker 0: that?"

163
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:06,923
Speaker 0: You say, "Who

164
00:11:07,487 --> 00:11:07,567
Speaker 0: he?".

165
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,019
Speaker 0: That's how it goes.

166
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:14,340
Speaker 1: Anyway, we do nominally have a topic for today.

167
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:19,780
Speaker 1: It's a game that we both played on different systems, and the game has been released for a million freaking systems.

168
00:11:20,501 --> 00:11:23,840
Speaker 1: Before we get into that, what's a pirate's favorite video game?

169
00:11:25,308 --> 00:11:25,779
Speaker 2: R-Type.

170
00:11:26,901 --> 00:11:30,240
Speaker 2: What's a pirate ricer's favorite type of car?

171
00:11:30,901 --> 00:11:31,309
Speaker 0: A GT-R.

172
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,740
Speaker 0: No, a type R.

173
00:11:36,784 --> 00:11:38,739
Speaker 2: What's a pirate's second favorite video game?

174
00:11:40,648 --> 00:11:41,540
Speaker 2: The Legend of Zelda.

175
00:11:43,605 --> 00:11:45,100
Speaker 0: There not be such a game.

176
00:11:47,883 --> 00:11:49,197
Speaker 1: Alright, I think we're done.

177
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,540
Speaker 3: Not R, Revolution Racing.

178
00:11:53,903 --> 00:11:54,918
Speaker 1: R, Ridge Racer.

179
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,376
Speaker 0: Ridge Racer.

180
00:11:59,462 --> 00:12:00,459
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're in silly today.

181
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:03,360
Speaker 1: Wow, we were tired yesterday, we're silly today.

182
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,799
Speaker 1: I promise the rest of the week will be normal.

183
00:12:05,604 --> 00:12:06,180
Speaker 0: No, it won't.

184
00:12:06,301 --> 00:12:07,039
Speaker 1: I won't have it all.

185
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:07,777
Speaker 0: Not a chance.

186
00:12:07,921 --> 00:12:10,540
Speaker 1: Anyway, the game we said we wanted to talk about, because it's easy.

187
00:12:11,683 --> 00:12:16,919
Speaker 1: Now, the game is Sid Meier's Pirates, and it's a really old game that's been released for a whole bunch of different systems.

188
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,880
Speaker 1: I played it on the NES, and Scott played it on the Genesis.

189
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,800
Speaker 0: Well, I played it on the Genesis emulator.

190
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,059
Speaker 0: This thing, though, you gotta understand how old this game is.

191
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:29,017
Speaker 0: This thing came out for the Amiga, the Apple II, the Apple IIGS, the Atari, the Commodore, the Mac.

192
00:12:29,402 --> 00:12:30,579
Speaker 0: And all the other systems listed.

193
00:12:30,822 --> 00:12:31,939
Speaker 0: The Amstrad CPC.

194
00:12:32,522 --> 00:12:33,440
Speaker 0: On the Wikipedia article.

195
00:12:33,883 --> 00:12:34,578
Speaker 1: That you're reading right now.

196
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of freaking systems.

197
00:12:38,043 --> 00:12:39,420
Speaker 0: We're gonna be talking about the old version.

198
00:12:39,501 --> 00:12:42,820
Speaker 0: We haven't played the new version that came out in 2004.

199
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,040
Speaker 1: However, from what I've heard, the new version is pretty much the same game.

200
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:46,711
Speaker 0: Yeah.

201
00:12:47,162 --> 00:12:47,251
Speaker 0: Yeah.

202
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,000
Speaker 0: At least that's what I've heard, also.

203
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:53,980
Speaker 1: Now, a lot of people talk about Grand Theft Auto, and how this game was revolutionary for its open gameplay.

204
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,140
Speaker 1: Now, you could just go anywhere and do anything, and there were no real, like, fully defined victory conditions.

205
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,940
Speaker 1: You just got out of it whatever you wanted, but there were missions in case you wanted to try to follow the story.

206
00:13:04,721 --> 00:13:08,379
Speaker 1: This game was basically Grand Theft 16th Century Boats.

207
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,980
Speaker 0: That's exactly what it was.

208
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:15,638
Speaker 0: You started in a town, and in the town you could hire a crew, buy a boat, all that sort of stuff.

209
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,780
Speaker 0: You could get a writ of, what's it called?

210
00:13:18,321 --> 00:13:21,380
Speaker 0: You could get a letter of marque, which is basically a privateering license.

211
00:13:22,121 --> 00:13:29,915
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, you would start out as either, like, a Dutch, or a British, or a Spanish, or all these different, you know, all the nationalities around, depending on what centuries you're playing in.

212
00:13:30,721 --> 00:13:36,599
Speaker 1: And then, you'd start as them, and nominally, you were supposed to prey on the shipping of nations that your nation was at war with.

213
00:13:37,022 --> 00:13:42,839
Speaker 1: So say you're British, and the British are at war with the French, and you see a French ship, you're perfectly within your rights to attack that ship.

214
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,880
Speaker 1: But the thing is, you could just attack any ship.

215
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,815
Speaker 1: You could just say, "Screw it and attack British

216
00:13:48,835 --> 00:13:49,078
Speaker 1: ships!".

217
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:54,059
Speaker 1: You could just raid a town if you wanted to, or go searching for buried treasure, which was all over the place.

218
00:13:54,820 --> 00:14:02,619
Speaker 1: Also the Spanish had their gold armada going around, and there was also the silver train going around from town to town, and you could try to capture that.

219
00:14:03,102 --> 00:14:04,237
Speaker 1: You could try to marry women.

220
00:14:05,103 --> 00:14:06,680
Speaker 1: The game was just completely open-ended.

221
00:14:07,201 --> 00:14:17,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, most of what you do to try to win is you want to get as much gold as you can, and then you go back to wherever you, if you did, decided to get a letter of mark, and you would say, "Haha!

222
00:14:17,261 --> 00:14:17,812
Speaker 0: Look at all this

223
00:14:17,853 --> 00:14:18,159
Speaker 0: gold!".

224
00:14:18,322 --> 00:14:19,700
Speaker 0: And then you would get, like, the best ending.

225
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:26,860
Speaker 0: But there were other ways, you know, to go about the game, and, you know, you could stop playing it anytime you wanted, and start playing anytime you wanted.

226
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,000
Speaker 1: Yep, and the game, like, it wasn't over if you lost.

227
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:39,099
Speaker 1: Like, one time I lost my ship, and all that happened was I was captured, held in prison for, like, four years, then I escaped, but now I had a disease, so I was sick, and I was much older.

228
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:39,507
Speaker 0: Yeah.

229
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:45,340
Speaker 0: The game is really a whole bunch of smaller games sort of tied together into the same system.

230
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:51,500
Speaker 0: I mean, like, the boat fighting another boat is one game, you know, shooting cannonballs and sailing around a little mini-map.

231
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,599
Speaker 0: And then there's the sword fighting game, where you actually board another ship and have to sword fight the other captain, and that's another game.

232
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,972
Speaker 0: Then attacking a fortress on the land is a whole 'nother?

233
00:15:00,992 --> 00:15:05,760
Speaker 0: game, and then managing your resources is yet another game, and they're all tied together.

234
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,279
Speaker 0: Navigating around the world is another game.

235
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:26,518
Speaker 1: Yep, and the world map was large and somewhat complex, and towns would change hands, and towns would figure out, like, say you're an enemy of the British, but you're fine with the Dutch, and you're going around, and you attack a Dutch ship at some point, and then you go to a Dutch town, everyone's fine, you go to another Dutch town, everyone's fine, because no one heard about it yet.

236
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,160
Speaker 1: But then a ship that ran afoul of the people who you've attacked get to a town, and then word starts spreading.

237
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:42,577
Speaker 1: And one day, you go to a Dutch port, and every time you go to a port, it always asks you, "Do you want to sail in openly, sneak in, land the ship far away and walk in, or

238
00:15:42,697 --> 00:15:43,098
Speaker 1: attack?".

239
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:50,180
Speaker 1: And if you just sail into town, but word had spread that you were actually a pirate, suddenly they start shooting at you, and your ships might get sunk.

240
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:55,639
Speaker 0: Yeah, the advantage of sailing into town openly is that it's real easy to buy goods and load them up on your boat.

241
00:15:56,181 --> 00:16:03,200
Speaker 0: But if you really need to do business in the town, like talk to someone in the town or something like that, you can always sneak into town.

242
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,439
Speaker 0: And sometimes you can sneak into town and take it over that way.

243
00:16:07,361 --> 00:16:15,900
Speaker 0: Or you could, you know, it was very easy, actually, once you got the hang of it, and you had enough resources, to just sail your boat into town and blow it up, unless they had a wicked fortress.

244
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:20,798
Speaker 1: And even then, you just park your boat upstream a bit and march your army of sailors into the town.

245
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:21,976
Speaker 0: Yep, yep, yep.

246
00:16:23,561 --> 00:16:24,123
Speaker 0: That's the thing, is?

247
00:16:24,143 --> 00:16:29,960
Speaker 0: there were a lot of minigames, and they all were pretty cool, but once you figured them out, they became stupid.

248
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:32,831
Speaker 0: Like, if you know what you're doing, you should win every sword fight, every single time.

249
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,510
Speaker 1: Yep, and in terms of ship combat, it basically came down to, there's a whole bunch of different kinds of ships, but in a fight, you really

250
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,293
Speaker 3: always

251
00:16:39,334 --> 00:16:46,720
Speaker 1: just want to use the tiniest, crappiest ship with this one little cannon, and just circle around the enemy ship going ping ping ping ping ping ping ping, until they eventually started sinking.

252
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:53,759
Speaker 0: Yeah, because if you know, as soon as you build the skill of sailing that boat, no one can hit you, you know, no matter what they do.

253
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:58,359
Speaker 0: Unless they also have the same boat, in which case you want to collide with them and then do the sword fight thing.

254
00:16:58,761 --> 00:17:05,659
Speaker 1: Now the gameplay really satisfies, at least early on, this urge I have for types of games that don't exist so much anymore.

255
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:14,020
Speaker 1: The empire building kind of games, where you have a large thing to manage, and you travel around managing it, and everything matters.

256
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:24,940
Speaker 1: Like if you find a ship and you capture it, now you've got two ships in your armada, so you put half your supplies on one ship, but all your sailors on the other ship, you move stuff around, and you basically just travel around the world.

257
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:30,509
Speaker 1: If you run into a ship, it says "You see a ship in the distance, it has British flags, what do you want to

258
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:30,672
Speaker 1: do?".

259
00:17:31,262 --> 00:17:32,354
Speaker 1: "Oh a town, I'll go in and do

260
00:17:32,394 --> 00:17:32,556
Speaker 1: this.".

261
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,177
Speaker 1: "Oh, the governor doesn't like me, maybe I'll bribe

262
00:17:35,258 --> 00:17:35,358
Speaker 1: him.".

263
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:48,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the game doesn't give you any direction at all, I mean, if you decide that you want to play a game where you sink ships of France and you don't do anything else, you're basically going to be a warboat, you can be a warboat and not do any pirating at all.

264
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:54,040
Speaker 0: You know, if you want to go and just look for buried treasure and not do anything else, you can go and try to do that.

265
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:58,697
Speaker 0: It might fail because you might run out of resources or something, but you're welcome to try.

266
00:18:00,102 --> 00:18:09,558
Speaker 1: Now the game had a million, like you could start in all these different centuries, it was very historical, the game was really designed to teach you a lot about that age of sailing and piracy.

267
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:32,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's pretty cool, like, in the years in which like, you know, France and Britain, you know, made peace and then went to war again and made peace and went to war again, that happens in the game, so you'll be like fighting a French ship, if you're British, and then you'll land in a port and there'll be news that, you know, there's peace between Britain and France and the peace was made before you started fighting that guy.

268
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:32,832
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

269
00:18:33,921 --> 00:18:45,249
Speaker 1: Or, what was more fun is when you'd go into town somewhere and you'd head off and you're British and then you see French and you're allied with the French and you see a French ship and you're like "alright, hello" and you try to go in, they attack you, what the fuck?

270
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,467
Speaker 1: And then you end up in a French town and they attack you and then you find out that you're at war.

271
00:18:49,041 --> 00:19:06,979
Speaker 0: Yup, it's pretty crazy like that, you know, because it accurately models the slowness of communications all those centuries ago when they didn't have internets and telephones or anything and the boat was the fastest way to get information and you're in one and you're still getting it way too late.

272
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:15,140
Speaker 1: Now the game also taught you a lot about geography and about colonization, you know, which countries colonized, which islands and which parts of the Americas when.

273
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:24,498
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean a lot of time you spend sailing around the Caribbean and you can see pretty accurately like "hey, there's a city there on Jamaica and look who's got it".

274
00:19:24,638 --> 00:19:29,418
Speaker 0: now you learn "oh, those are the people who took over Jamaica and colonized that island".

275
00:19:29,478 --> 00:19:37,460
Speaker 1: and then- Of course, you could totally throw a monkey wrench in that by, you know, conquering places and stalling your own governors on behalf of the king.

276
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:46,179
Speaker 0: Well, of course, but at least if you sail around and just look at the way stuff is after many plays of the game, you learn what it's like and, you know.

277
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:50,940
Speaker 1: Now sadly, the game is really fun for about an hour.

278
00:19:51,661 --> 00:19:55,200
Speaker 0: I'd say the game is fun until you figure it out.

279
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:08,060
Speaker 0: Like if you haven't figured out the sword fighting and you haven't figured out the ship combat and you haven't done everything, like you haven't taken a town, you haven't found a buried treasure, you know, it depends on your skill level.

280
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:14,658
Speaker 0: How long does it take you to do everything once and become the master of all these different little games?

281
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:21,080
Speaker 0: Once you've reached that point, then the game has nothing else for you because you can just play it and do whatever you want with nothing standing in your way.

282
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:31,357
Speaker 1: There's also the fact that the gameplay gets very tedious because it basically ends up, if you want to sail somewhere, you sail in game time with no way to speed it up or slowing down.

283
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:37,780
Speaker 1: So your ship is just going and going and going and going and going and going for minutes and minutes and minutes, occasionally running into other ships.

284
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:42,080
Speaker 1: But if you're in a depopulated area, sometimes there's not even ships around, just nothing.

285
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:54,580
Speaker 0: And sometimes it's pretty annoying because the wind will go against you, you know, and actually teaches you pretty well about trade winds and, you know, sailing routes and sea lanes and all that stuff, you know, the way the wind goes.

286
00:20:54,680 --> 00:21:02,760
Speaker 0: But if you don't know what you're doing, you don't know where the good winds are, you could end up sailing against the wind for like 10 minutes, not getting anywhere.

287
00:21:03,142 --> 00:21:10,839
Speaker 1: Yup, meanwhile your crew is running out of food and rum and they're getting pissed off and they're getting scurvy and then they mutiny and then pirates come and get you.

288
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:17,719
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing about the game is that there are actual pirates out there too and usually until you learn the game, they'll just kick your ass.

289
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:22,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, the pirates are rightly the most dangerous guys in the game most of the time.

290
00:21:23,485 --> 00:21:24,699
Speaker 1: Other than the British Navy.

291
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:32,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I mean, they have these black boats that sail around and kind of show up randomly and if they kick your ass, you're in big trouble.

292
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:40,379
Speaker 0: But if you kick their ass, it kind of sucks because if you attack, say, a French boat, there's a pretty good chance there's something on it.

293
00:21:40,783 --> 00:21:41,479
Speaker 0: A pirate boat?

294
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,840
Speaker 0: You got like a one in three chance of them having pirated something already.

295
00:21:46,401 --> 00:21:49,739
Speaker 0: You know, they might not have anything because they're pirates and they used it all.

296
00:21:51,641 --> 00:21:59,639
Speaker 1: The game also really paid attention to a lot of detail that you probably wouldn't know or care about unless you read a FAQ of how it calculated all this crap.

297
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:12,219
Speaker 1: But I mean, the weather and the kinds of ships you used mattered, supposedly, but it never really was clear in the game how it all mattered and you pretty much ended up just ignoring all that stuff even though you know it's all in there.

298
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:20,678
Speaker 0: Yeah, sort of like for sword fighting, you could choose if you had like a rapier, a sword, or what was the other one?

299
00:22:21,242 --> 00:22:22,520
Speaker 1: I don't remember, a cutlass or something?

300
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, or a cutlass or a scimitar.

301
00:22:24,621 --> 00:22:33,120
Speaker 0: You had a choice of swords and it really didn't matter at all which sword you chose and you usually chose the rapier just because it was the easiest to win with.

302
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:36,579
Speaker 1: You also designed your pirate character and you got to pick what he was good at.

303
00:22:37,063 --> 00:22:37,317
Speaker 1: Yeah.

304
00:22:37,663 --> 00:22:38,600
Speaker 1: I always picked charming.

305
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:46,580
Speaker 0: I always picked sword fighting because the sword fighting was the way to win all the sword fights automatically and it would just take less time to win them if I had sword fighting.

306
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,919
Speaker 1: See, I won them automatically just by having more guys usually because I was charming.

307
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:56,279
Speaker 0: See, my goal is every sword fight, I basically hit the other guy till he died and never got hit myself.

308
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,134
Speaker 0: So, I could have one guy and I would do just as well at the game as if I had a hundred guys.

309
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,920
Speaker 1: Now, sadly, there aren't so many other good pirate games.

310
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,480
Speaker 1: I can't name really any particularly good games that are pirate themed other than Monkey Island.

311
00:23:12,144 --> 00:23:12,356
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

312
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,765
Speaker 0: Well, of course Monkey Island.

313
00:23:13,805 --> 00:23:18,320
Speaker 0: but the video games, yeah, it's pretty hard to find pirate themed video games.

314
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:25,000
Speaker 0: I mean, there are a bunch of One Piece games but they're all like fighting games and stuff and they're not that great from what I've seen.

315
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,720
Speaker 0: I played one in the store once.

316
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,640
Speaker 1: The new Sid Meier's Pirates, if I said this before, is pretty much the same as this game, just pretty.

317
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,553
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's 3D and it's new and I never played it.

318
00:23:33,613 --> 00:23:34,860
Speaker 0: but I'm just going on here, say.

319
00:23:35,201 --> 00:23:37,579
Speaker 1: I wanted it but I still saw it for like 50 bucks, so.

320
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I don't think either of our computers, my computer could probably play it.

321
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,498
Speaker 1: My computer can't.

322
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,456
Speaker 0: No, it can't.

323
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:48,258
Speaker 0: Maybe when we get new computers, we'll get like a used copy or something or we'll pirate it.

324
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:48,980
Speaker 3: Yarr.

325
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:49,429
Speaker 3: Yarr.

326
00:23:50,807 --> 00:23:51,039
Speaker 0: Yeah.

327
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,760
Speaker 0: What other pirate video games are not easy to come by?

328
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,380
Speaker 1: Even pirate board games, we were burned by that a bunch of times.

329
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:03,023
Speaker 1: There's a lot of German board games that are pirate themed and without exception, they're all S.

330
00:24:03,264 --> 00:24:07,340
Speaker 0: Well, I think Moiterer, which is a card game actually, is a good pirate game.

331
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,045
Speaker 1: It's the least S.

332
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:13,380
Speaker 0: It is, Moiterer is probably the best pirate themed board card game ever.

333
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,940
Speaker 1: Even though, I mean, the game seemed, I don't remember if we really talked about the game in depth.

334
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,040
Speaker 1: The game seems kind of broken, but it's still fun to play.

335
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,139
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's really fun.

336
00:24:20,261 --> 00:24:21,299
Speaker 0: It might be a little broken.

337
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:30,680
Speaker 0: It just, basically once everyone knows how to play, whatever, we're not going to talk about Moiterer now, but let's see, what other pirate games are there?

338
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:35,180
Speaker 0: There's that game that everyone plays with the little put together ships.

339
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,679
Speaker 1: Oh, the cardboard collectible ships.

340
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Pirates of the Spanish Main or whatever it's called.

341
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,880
Speaker 0: It actually looks like an okay game.

342
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:44,280
Speaker 0: I just don't want to collect ships.

343
00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:51,240
Speaker 0: I mean, if there was some way that's like, you just buy the game in a box and that's it, then I would be cool with it, but I'm really against the collecting bit.

344
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:59,578
Speaker 1: Well, see, the way people explain that game to me was that if you know anything about ships, it's really annoying because the ships move more like star ships than they do like actual ships.

345
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,433
Speaker 0: I think that's why they released a new game that has a similar system that uses rocket ships.

346
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,560
Speaker 1: We should try to play that Steve Jackson pirate game.

347
00:25:08,042 --> 00:25:08,718
Speaker 0: Which one's that?

348
00:25:09,263 --> 00:25:10,620
Speaker 1: The paper one that we never played.

349
00:25:11,683 --> 00:25:12,780
Speaker 0: Ah, ah, yeah.

350
00:25:12,962 --> 00:25:13,479
Speaker 0: Maybe we should.

351
00:25:13,827 --> 00:25:14,399
Speaker 0: That might be cool.

352
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,086
Speaker 0: There was a, what was that one?

353
00:25:16,126 --> 00:25:18,399
Speaker 0: we played once that was basically like had a treasure map.

354
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,759
Speaker 0: It was like a kid's game.

355
00:25:20,262 --> 00:25:21,639
Speaker 1: I wasn't there and I didn't play it.

356
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,240
Speaker 0: Oh, it's like, it was like a treasure map with a bunch of squares.

357
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,960
Speaker 1: It was like you and Luke playing that game.

358
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:26,310
Speaker 0: Yeah.

359
00:25:26,821 --> 00:25:28,720
Speaker 0: Like you go around the map looking for the treasure.

360
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,920
Speaker 0: It's pretty, uh, it's a pretty lame kid's game.

361
00:25:32,561 --> 00:25:37,080
Speaker 0: And there's some other ones, you know, I've seen that like Pirates Cove or something.

362
00:25:37,201 --> 00:25:38,860
Speaker 0: I don't know what they're actually called.

363
00:25:39,181 --> 00:25:44,076
Speaker 0: They've seen it around and you sail around bringing goods from island to island and stuff like that.

364
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,479
Speaker 1: It surprises me that pirates are so well loved among geeks.

365
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,440
Speaker 1: I mean, geeks seem to be split pretty much 50/50 pirates or ninjas.

366
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,740
Speaker 1: Yet there are a billion ninja games for every video game system ever.

367
00:25:56,622 --> 00:25:57,498
Speaker 1: No pirate games.

368
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:02,918
Speaker 0: But I think it's just the pirate theme doesn't really lend itself very well to...

369
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,340
Speaker 1: What are you talking about?

370
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,060
Speaker 1: You could have a ship combat game.

371
00:26:06,282 --> 00:26:06,700
Speaker 1: Straight up.

372
00:26:06,762 --> 00:26:07,220
Speaker 0: Oh, I know.

373
00:26:07,261 --> 00:26:08,699
Speaker 0: There's Pirates, Vikings, and Knights.

374
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:10,217
Speaker 1: Ah, yeah.

375
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,540
Speaker 1: I forgot about that game.

376
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:11,833
Speaker 0: Yeah.

377
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,217
Speaker 0: Okay.

378
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,015
Speaker 0: There's an old mod for Half-Life 1 that's free.

379
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,480
Speaker 0: Well, Half-Life 1 isn't free.

380
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,176
Speaker 0: The mod is free.

381
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,200
Speaker 0: Called Pirates, Vikings, and Knights.

382
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,039
Speaker 1: Now you might be wondering, what is this game about?

383
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:30,080
Speaker 0: It's basically a deathmatch on a bunch of different maps in which pirates, Vikings, and knights fight each other.

384
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,180
Speaker 0: And you can choose which team you want to be on.

385
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,140
Speaker 0: And then after you choose your team, you can choose your class.

386
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:41,320
Speaker 0: So like, if you're a knight, you can either be like the peasant, the super armored knight.

387
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,540
Speaker 1: There's like the archer, the knight, that kind of thing.

388
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,080
Speaker 0: So the pirates was like the guy with the handheld cannon.

389
00:26:47,823 --> 00:26:49,160
Speaker 1: You mean the captain with the blunderbuss.

390
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, the guy with the hook, and the guy with the sword.

391
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,159
Speaker 1: That was also the captain, Scott.

392
00:26:53,743 --> 00:26:54,620
Speaker 1: That was also the captain.

393
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,060
Speaker 0: Whatever.

394
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,180
Speaker 0: There was a guy with a parrot.

395
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,640
Speaker 1: All those things you said were the captain.

396
00:26:58,081 --> 00:26:59,539
Speaker 0: The captain's the only one you should play as.

397
00:26:59,641 --> 00:27:00,198
Speaker 0: The other guy sucks.

398
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:00,818
Speaker 1: Whatever.

399
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,059
Speaker 0: The other guy's a gun, right?

400
00:27:02,502 --> 00:27:03,140
Speaker 0: It's like a pistol.

401
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:08,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically the game was cool because there's these treasure chests, and they're really big and heavy.

402
00:27:08,621 --> 00:27:10,180
Speaker 1: And you're all fighting, and you all have a base.

403
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,739
Speaker 1: And the knights have all these treasure chests, and they're trying to protect them.

404
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:21,518
Speaker 1: The pirates and the Vikings are both trying to steal these chests from the knights, drag them back to their own base, and they get points for how long they sit there in their base.

405
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,059
Speaker 1: And when they get stolen, the knights try to get them back.

406
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, the knights are actually the most dangerous guys in the game.

407
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,160
Speaker 0: They have like those giant swords that chop you in half.

408
00:27:31,521 --> 00:27:32,300
Speaker 1: It's two kinds of games.

409
00:27:32,601 --> 00:27:36,700
Speaker 1: One, it's the pirates and the Vikings together versus the knights.

410
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:41,057
Speaker 1: But then, the pirates and the Vikings are competing with each other over the chests as well.

411
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,420
Speaker 0: And you can kill anyone.

412
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:44,959
Speaker 0: Team kill should be on in a game like this.

413
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:48,400
Speaker 1: The game was really poorly done, but that just made it more awesome.

414
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:53,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know how you play Counter-Strike, and then Inevi- I think this was something really enlightening.

415
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:59,320
Speaker 0: I was watching a video with the guy who worked on Team Fortress 2, which isn't out yet.

416
00:27:59,901 --> 00:28:03,540
Speaker 0: And he was like, "You know, when you play in FPS, inevitably, silly things happen.

417
00:28:03,901 --> 00:28:06,040
Speaker 0: You play NS and people dance on the cheese.

418
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:16,236
Speaker 0: You play Counter-Strike and a guy will blip through the door, or guys will pile up and do something silly, or there'll be a toilet and something funny

419
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:16,698
Speaker 0: happens.".

420
00:28:17,581 --> 00:28:25,819
Speaker 0: And in every FPS you'll play, they try to fight against the fact that FPS engines have this quality to them.

421
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:39,360
Speaker 0: They try to make the game really serious, and if a silly thing happens or a glitch happens that's hilarious, they try to take it out of the game and make it so it doesn't happen to ruin the mood of the game of serious military action.

422
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:45,560
Speaker 1: This game, pretty much the first thing everyone would ever try to do is make the treasure chest break somehow or disappear.

423
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:49,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, Team Fortress 2, the guy said, "What we want to do in this game is just embrace

424
00:28:49,706 --> 00:28:49,896
Speaker 0: that.".

425
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,920
Speaker 0: And I think Pirates and Vikings and Knights is the game that first embraced this quality.

426
00:28:55,681 --> 00:29:00,648
Speaker 0: Especially since the maps are so complicated and Half-Life 1, that shit was just bound to happen.

427
00:29:00,668 --> 00:29:01,500
Speaker 0: that was out of control.

428
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,575
Speaker 1: Though granted, I think Natural Selection embraced it, but in an entirely different way.

429
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,680
Speaker 0: Well, I think the community embraced it, I don't think the game embraced it.

430
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,340
Speaker 1: Well, the game did in a couple little ways.

431
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:16,880
Speaker 1: For one, the reason the gorge jumping was so cool was because they never actually put in the jumping animations, the gorge just kind of floated around.

432
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:22,604
Speaker 1: And all the players demanded that they leave it that way, even though they could have fixed it.

433
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,999
Speaker 1: And then two, they set up the ready rooms with stuff in them.

434
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:30,999
Speaker 1: So no matter what silly stuff would happen in there, they designed those rooms for silly stuff to happen.

435
00:29:31,781 --> 00:29:32,599
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess, I guess.

436
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:39,000
Speaker 0: But other than that, the game, inside the game, they didn't want silly things to go on.

437
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:44,460
Speaker 0: It was supposed to be a serious dark and moody alien versus human marine thing.

438
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:49,080
Speaker 1: Well, I guess my question to all of our listeners is, are there good pirate games?

439
00:29:49,441 --> 00:29:50,278
Speaker 1: What are they?

440
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:51,899
Speaker 3: What are they?

441
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,898
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know there was like some sort of average crappy-ass pirate game for the PS2.

442
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,658
Speaker 0: And I know there's a lot of games that are like air pirates, you know, or other.

443
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:02,235
Speaker 1: Now, whoa!

444
00:30:02,641 --> 00:30:12,860
Speaker 1: We're not talking about Crimson Skies, because while air pirates are perhaps the coolest thing that's ever been conceived by humankind, I really consider them to be above and beyond this conversation.

445
00:30:13,283 --> 00:30:14,200
Speaker 0: I also agree.

446
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:23,880
Speaker 1: I'm talking about pirates with scurvy, ugly beards, cutting people with swords and collecting gold, and then not actually doing anything with that gold because they're pirates.

447
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:28,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm sure there are games based on Pirates of the Caribbean, the movie and stuff.

448
00:30:29,201 --> 00:30:30,480
Speaker 1: I don't think those games are good.

449
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,600
Speaker 1: If they are, prove us wrong.

450
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:36,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, I also don't think those games have any chance of being good if they exist.

451
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,300
Speaker 0: Uh, you know, there are pirate games.

452
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,540
Speaker 0: The thing is, none of them are of note.

453
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:52,200
Speaker 0: I mean, the one we talked about, Sid Meier's Pirates, is the, besides Monkey Island, those two are the most notable pirate games, and none of them are that recent.

454
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,960
Speaker 0: I mean, even the new Sid Meier's Pirates came out, what, two years ago?

455
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:56,617
Speaker 0: Three years ago?

456
00:30:56,905 --> 00:30:57,140
Speaker 0: Yeah.

457
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:57,610
Speaker 0: Yeah.

458
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,840
Speaker 0: So, I mean, come on, where are the good pirate games?

459
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,819
Speaker 0: We got ninja games out the ass.

460
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:04,979
Speaker 0: Where are the pirates at?

461
00:31:05,301 --> 00:31:05,979
Speaker 0: Where's the respect?

462
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:07,105
Speaker 3: Arrr.

463
00:31:08,601 --> 00:31:19,511
Speaker 2: So, I guess I be closing with the final note that starting tomorrow, the pirate talk will be gone, as will the tiredness and some of the silliness, and the show will be back to what it usually is-ar.

464
00:31:21,061 --> 00:31:22,979
Speaker 1: That really hurts my throat, so I can't do that anymore.

465
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:29,838
Speaker 0: Yar, and if you be wondering why we be talking in the pirate fashion for this, most of this episode.

466
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,780
Speaker 1: If you're wondering that, then you're an idiot.

467
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:40,399
Speaker 3: You should be visiting a very certain website, and you should be using the internets and keeping your eyes open.

468
00:31:40,821 --> 00:31:42,419
Speaker 3: What kind of geek are ye?

469
00:31:42,781 --> 00:31:50,439
Speaker 1: Actually, I'll end this with a funny anecdote from Emily, who, as we learned in the forums, was incredibly popular when she appeared on the show.

470
00:31:51,381 --> 00:32:05,380
Speaker 1: But she studies film and animation, and she was in a class, I think it was last year, when people were pitching their ideas for something, like a project, and one guy had this great idea to have some pirates and some ninjas, and they fight.

471
00:32:06,661 --> 00:32:12,950
Speaker 1: And the class has to critique it, and she says, "Well, that's cool and all, but isn't that idea just completely

472
00:32:13,051 --> 00:32:13,514
Speaker 1: overdone?".

473
00:32:14,543 --> 00:32:15,880
Speaker 1: And the guy had no idea.

474
00:32:16,361 --> 00:32:17,158
Speaker 1: He didn't know.

475
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:23,938
Speaker 1: He had no idea that this pirate versus ninja thing has been a staple of the internet for like seven years.

476
00:32:25,341 --> 00:32:34,579
Speaker 1: He had absolutely no clue at all, and a lot of people in the class didn't either, and she had to explain it to him, which I can't imagine that.

477
00:32:35,681 --> 00:32:47,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like there's this whole world, and people have to like, you know, stay in touch with it, and it's one thing, like I am not in touch with the pop culture world, but that is on purpose.

478
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:55,515
Speaker 0: I know it's there, and I can tell if someone is talking about something that is pop culture, and I say, "Oh, okay, that's something I don't know in pop culture,".

479
00:32:55,615 --> 00:32:58,619
Speaker 0: and I can try to figure it out if it seems like something I have to know.

480
00:32:58,941 --> 00:33:04,999
Speaker 1: I can tell when there are rumblings in the pop culture world, because I can see the natives scrambling and there's chatter.

481
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:14,031
Speaker 1: Whenever something happens in that world, all the people at my work are chattering about it, and I hear tidbits like, "Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, Paris Hilton, blah, something, blah, something, oh my God,

482
00:33:14,052 --> 00:33:14,316
Speaker 1: blah.".

483
00:33:15,251 --> 00:33:16,720
Speaker 1: I kind of piece together what's going on.

484
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:29,500
Speaker 0: And like little tidbits of it like pop up every now and then on like Google News and Digg and all that stuff, but you know, to not be in touch at all, at all with like what's going on in the internet.

485
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:33,940
Speaker 1: Especially if you're in college and you don't know about Pirates versus Ninjas.

486
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:40,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you're making movies about Pirates and Ninjas, pretty much before you do anything you should Google it.

487
00:33:40,761 --> 00:33:46,390
Speaker 0: That's the rule from now until a very long time in the future, Google everything before you do it.

488
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:53,580
Speaker 0: Especially, you know, to make sure, wake up and Google the day, every day you wake up to make sure it's not a holiday.

489
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,459
Speaker 3: Like talk like a pirate day.

490
00:33:57,062 --> 00:34:04,600
Speaker 1: And as a final, final, final note, because people seem to have wondered a bit, and some people didn't seem sure if we would celebrate talk like a pirate day or not.

491
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:09,679
Speaker 1: We've celebrated talk like a pirate day for as long as we have known that it has existed.

492
00:34:09,801 --> 00:34:11,418
Speaker 0: I think we've celebrated every single one.

493
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,498
Speaker 1: I think so because it started kind of recently.

494
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:17,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, well it started a long time ago, but it was popularized.

495
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,520
Speaker 1: It started in terms of the internet made a big deal about it recently.

496
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:24,159
Speaker 1: Like in the last four or five years.

497
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,380
Speaker 0: Very, very recently.

498
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,420
Speaker 0: So we're on top of it.

499
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:36,340
Speaker 0: It's like our holiday, it's so weird, it's like I was raised Jewish, right, and I celebrated holidays like Purim and stuff every single year of my life.

500
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:45,699
Speaker 1: I was raised in a normal white bread suburban family, and because we were nominally Catholic, just because I went to Catholic school, we celebrated, you know, Christmas and Easter and all that stuff.

501
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,800
Speaker 0: Now I celebrate talk like a pirate day.

502
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:51,400
Speaker 0: I'm more observant of that holiday than pretty much any other holiday.

503
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:58,100
Speaker 1: I pretty much only celebrate talk like a pirate day, Thanksgiving, but the way I celebrate that is I eat a whole bunch of food.

504
00:34:58,241 --> 00:35:02,179
Speaker 0: The way I observe all the other holidays is I either get a day off of work or I don't.

505
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is the only holiday where I actually do something.

506
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:10,620
Speaker 1: In fact, for any of our longer time listeners, you might remember what happened to us last Christmas.

507
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:14,695
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a funny one.

508
00:35:14,775 --> 00:35:15,640
Speaker 0: Go back and listen to that.

509
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could repeat it here.

510
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,130
Speaker 0: Oh, no, don't go back and listen.

511
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,040
Speaker 0: That's probably terrible.

512
00:35:19,542 --> 00:35:20,979
Speaker 1: But God, that was a long time ago.

513
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it'll be funny.

514
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,960
Speaker 1: Are we going to have to be like George Lucas and remaster all of our early episodes?

515
00:35:27,603 --> 00:35:30,639
Speaker 0: No, we're just going to put them all in one DVD and then sell them.

516
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,540
Speaker 1: You know what I'm going to do if we ever release Geek Nights on a DVD or something?

517
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:39,680
Speaker 1: I'm going to add Jabba the Hutt and Greedo shooting first, randomly.

518
00:35:40,427 --> 00:35:40,899
Speaker 0: Good idea.

519
00:35:42,121 --> 00:35:43,139
Speaker 1: We'll have a special edition.

520
00:35:44,322 --> 00:35:45,066
Speaker 0: With extras.

521
00:35:45,308 --> 00:35:47,039
Speaker 0: It costs more and it comes in a tin box.

522
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:53,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it'll have those Geek Nights scenes that we always wanted to add, but we didn't have the technology to add.

523
00:35:54,379 --> 00:35:54,420
Speaker 1: Oh.

524
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,380
Speaker 1: Like, I can't think of anything funny.

525
00:35:58,822 --> 00:36:00,060
Speaker 1: I can't think of anything funny at all.

526
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,480
Speaker 0: Like when Long John Silver came into the room right now and shot Rim in the head.

527
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:09,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, we just we couldn't afford to get the Foley and all that, you know, make the special effects for it.

528
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:10,984
Speaker 3: Yeah.

529
00:36:11,307 --> 00:36:13,000
Speaker 0: Oh, by the way, Muppet Trisha Allen is awesome.

530
00:36:17,021 --> 00:36:21,120
Speaker 1: I promise, starting tomorrow, Geek Nights will be back on track with the show you know and love.

531
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:25,380
Speaker 0: I think this is the show they know and love, the show that tomorrow is the show they hate.

532
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, I seem to get that impression.

533
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,840
Speaker 1: The more we hate an episode we do, the more people seem to like it and vice versa.

534
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,516
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, someone yesterday was backing me up on the AC-97.

535
00:36:35,301 --> 00:36:36,198
Speaker 0: Who would have thought about that?

536
00:36:37,603 --> 00:36:38,220
Speaker 0: I wouldn't have thought.

537
00:36:39,442 --> 00:36:40,679
Speaker 0: Anyway, we're done.

538
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,020
Speaker 3: Arrrrr.

539
00:36:50,143 --> 00:36:52,240
Speaker 1: And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

540
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,879
