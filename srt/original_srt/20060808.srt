1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,330
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, August 8th, and this is a Geek Nights Special.

2
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:14,277
Speaker 1: Hooray!

3
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,790
Speaker 1: What does it mean to be a Geek Nights Special?

4
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,509
Speaker 1: It means it's a short episode without all the trappings of Geek Nights, meaning it's not really an episode of Geek Nights.

5
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,129
Speaker 0: The reason is, we're not here!

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:34,927
Speaker 1: See, we were at Otacon this previous weekend, and for this whole week we were on the Jersey Shore, and possibly maybe in Atlantic City, and at a bunch of places doing a whole bunch of stuff.

7
00:00:35,972 --> 00:00:39,610
Speaker 0: And that means we can't record anything, or we can't record a real episode.

8
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:45,069
Speaker 1: Well actually, we're recording a whole ton of stuff, probably right now, but we're not going to be able to upload any of it.

9
00:00:47,634 --> 00:00:50,309
Speaker 0: So, as a result, we have pre-recorded the following for you.

10
00:00:50,750 --> 00:01:00,990
Speaker 1: You see, whenever we're going to be out of town, or for whatever reason we can't do an episode, we always make up for it with some Geek Nights Specials, which are free format, we talk until we run out of something to talk about, funny little stories, and whatnot.

11
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:18,028
Speaker 1: So if you're new to Geek Nights, which I'm sure a lot of you are because I'm sure a lot of you have found us as a result of Otacon, find any episode anywhere on the site or in our feed in iTunes that does not have the word "special" in the title to get a feel for what our show actually is.

12
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:27,629
Speaker 0: Alright, now, in this little special, we're going to tell this story about Panguacon 2.0, which we attended many years ago.

13
00:01:28,051 --> 00:01:32,989
Speaker 1: And it probably is still in my list of conventions I have gone to in the top five of greatest cons ever.

14
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,389
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, instances of cons, I mean, the convention as a whole, I can't really comment because I've only been to it once.

15
00:01:39,130 --> 00:02:05,930
Speaker 0: But anyway, part of the reason I'm telling this story is because there's a guy who does the Board Games To Go podcast, Mark Johnson, and he used to sorta kinda work for Steve Jackson kinda, he did a little podcast about it, so you can go listen to that at BoardGamesToGo.com, and you know, the story involves Steve Jackson, so I informed him that the story exists, and this is a perfect opportunity to tell that story so he can be entertained by it, and hopefully everyone else will also be entertained by the story.

16
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,729
Speaker 1: So on a whim, I went to Panguacon!

17
00:02:09,371 --> 00:02:16,310
Speaker 0: We went to Panguacon 2.0, which is primarily a Linux convention in Novi, Michigan, which is right near Detroit.

18
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's basically like a borough of Detroit, think of it that way.

19
00:02:20,051 --> 00:02:39,610
Speaker 0: But it was a hotel con, which is primarily about Linux, but they also had lots of gaming, they also had PC gaming, they had, let's see, not so much anime, a lot of sci-fi, fantasy, sword fighting kinda renaissance action, you know, but general geek con.

20
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:45,369
Speaker 1: One interesting note is that this convention had a perk that I've never had at any other convention where I wasn't staff.

21
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:53,610
Speaker 1: Anyone who had a badge to Panguacon was entitled to an infinite amount of free beer or free hard cider for the entire weekend.

22
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:57,829
Speaker 0: As long as you weren't already very intoxicated, they would continue to give it to you.

23
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:02,230
Speaker 1: Which was somewhat interesting, I've never experienced that at a con before.

24
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:11,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you know, it was pretty crazy to hang out in like this small hotel, relatively small hotel, and you got people in there like Neil Gaiman and shit, it was pretty crazy.

25
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:17,790
Speaker 1: Now I went kind of on a whim because I had a huge project, a project of the order of magnitude of...

26
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, this was in the college days, so he had a school project.

27
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:26,230
Speaker 1: If RIM doesn't finish this, RIM does not graduate, and it was due like the next week, like Tuesday.

28
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:39,490
Speaker 1: And I also didn't have enough money to go to the con, but I eventually decided to go anyway, and we all crammed into Alex's minivan, we had a wireless network in the minivan that was actually online through a cell phone.

29
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:40,310
Speaker 0: Through Canada.

30
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:53,290
Speaker 1: And we drove all the way through Canada, I showed everyone a big boy's diner, and there's a picture of us fondling the big boy, and then we made our way to Novi for this convention, which I don't think we ever covered the convention as a whole.

31
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:56,050
Speaker 0: No, but we're only going to tell one story from the convention.

32
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,649
Speaker 1: Yeah, we have many stories from this con.

33
00:03:58,311 --> 00:04:10,930
Speaker 0: The main story from this convention is that when we got there, things were pretty slow, we got there pretty early, and unlike other conventions, it wasn't already zooming away as soon as it opened, it was pretty toned down on Friday.

34
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:16,190
Speaker 0: So we decided to break out Puerto Rico, and play Puerto Rico in the hotel lobby.

35
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:29,087
Speaker 1: So we're playing, and this dude walks over, this older dude, and he's kind of scary looking, like he's got dark hair, little scary goatee, I wouldn't say scary, I'd say he just looked like a gamer.

36
00:04:29,592 --> 00:04:33,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, but you know, gamers are scarier than the average doofus.

37
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:33,989
Speaker 1: Well yeah, I'll agree to that.

38
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:34,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

39
00:04:35,473 --> 00:04:37,409
Speaker 0: He wasn't like a frightening holy crap guy.

40
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,998
Speaker 1: He walks over and he's like, "Hey, Puerto Rico, I've always wanted to play that game, it looks

41
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:41,246
Speaker 1: good.".

42
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,059
Speaker 0: And we're just paying attention to the game, like, "Yeah, Puerto Rico, this is like the best game

43
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:45,263
Speaker 0: ever.".

44
00:04:45,651 --> 00:04:47,010
Speaker 1: Like, we barely even look up at the guy.

45
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:47,839
Speaker 0: Barely.

46
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:52,808
Speaker 0: And then like a few, you know, he walks away, he's like, "Maybe I could play it

47
00:04:52,848 --> 00:04:53,170
Speaker 0: sometime.".

48
00:04:53,191 --> 00:04:53,683
Speaker 0: And we're like, "Yeah,

49
00:04:53,704 --> 00:04:53,868
Speaker 0: sure.".

50
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,909
Speaker 1: And we're like, "Yeah, well anytime we're around free, we'll play a game with

51
00:04:56,949 --> 00:04:57,029
Speaker 1: you.".

52
00:04:57,132 --> 00:04:57,283
Speaker 1: Yep.

53
00:04:57,892 --> 00:04:58,339
Speaker 0: He's like, "Yeah,

54
00:04:58,379 --> 00:04:58,521
Speaker 0: cool.".

55
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,080
Speaker 0: Then like a few minutes later, you know, some guy comes over and he's like, "Oh, I think that's Steve

56
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:03,430
Speaker 0: Jackson.".

57
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:03,714
Speaker 0: We're like,

58
00:05:03,734 --> 00:05:03,916
Speaker 0: "What?".

59
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:09,410
Speaker 0: And apparently, the guy who came over and talked to us about Puerto Rico was Steve Jackson.

60
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:09,820
Speaker 0: Yeah.

61
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,307
Speaker 0: And he did not make that known, but someone else knew it was him.

62
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,295
Speaker 0: Yep.

63
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:18,970
Speaker 0: If you don't know, Steve Jackson is the guy who runs Steve Jackson games.

64
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,385
Speaker 0: They make games like Illuminati, Munchkin, etc.

65
00:05:23,352 --> 00:05:24,046
Speaker 0: That's who he is.

66
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:24,507
Speaker 0: Yeah.

67
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:25,708
Speaker 0: In case you don't know who he is.

68
00:05:26,213 --> 00:05:28,089
Speaker 1: And he wanted to play Puerto Rico with us.

69
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,789
Speaker 0: Yeah, GURPS.

70
00:05:29,051 --> 00:05:29,687
Speaker 0: He also makes GURPS.

71
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,570
Speaker 1: Now, in addition to that, he brought this thing to the con, Chaos.

72
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:41,550
Speaker 1: And I'm not going to cover it in detail, but he basically gave everyone a pile of components of a marble machine.

73
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:46,130
Speaker 1: You know those machines where it pulls a marble to the top and then the marble goes down a bunch of stuff and makes it to the bottom?

74
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:53,368
Speaker 1: He brought enough stuff to make an infinite, like a massive one, just absolute a pile of stuff.

75
00:05:53,871 --> 00:05:56,005
Speaker 1: And he left it in a room and his instructions were, "Go

76
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:56,287
Speaker 1: nuts.".

77
00:05:57,093 --> 00:05:58,710
Speaker 1: We spent much of the con going nuts.

78
00:05:59,192 --> 00:05:59,870
Speaker 0: We did indeed.

79
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:07,389
Speaker 0: Now, a little later, you know, we saw him again and we were like, "Hey, now that we know who you are, we kind of want to play Puerto Rico with you.

80
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,095
Speaker 0: Hey.".

81
00:06:08,551 --> 00:06:13,209
Speaker 0: And, you know, even though we were being kind of doofus-y, annoying fanboys, he was just like, "Yeah, cool.

82
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,926
Speaker 0: We'll play it, you know, at this

83
00:06:14,967 --> 00:06:15,149
Speaker 0: time.".

84
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,746
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were like, "Sunday, like right before we leave, we'll

85
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:17,928
Speaker 1: play."

86
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:18,476
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

87
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:24,369
Speaker 1: Now, independent of all this, our friend James was pining after Lisa at the time.

88
00:06:24,835 --> 00:06:24,980
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

89
00:06:25,891 --> 00:06:37,808
Speaker 1: And he pretty much spent the entire convention carrying his laptop around on the wireless network just pouncing to make sure any time she was online, he talked to her, to the exclusion of talking to any of us or doing anything with us.

90
00:06:38,353 --> 00:06:39,990
Speaker 0: Or doing anything at the convention, really.

91
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:44,670
Speaker 0: I mean, he would go to some panels at the convention and he'd pay attention to the panel and his computer.

92
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:45,436
Speaker 1: Yep.

93
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:55,450
Speaker 1: And then Sunday, for various reasons, he decided that we had to get out of Detroit and back to Rochester as soon as possible, and he wanted to leave at the crack of dawn.

94
00:06:56,212 --> 00:06:57,090
Speaker 0: And we were like, "Uh, no.

95
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:57,970
Speaker 0: This convention's awesome.

96
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:58,621
Speaker 0: We kind of want to hang

97
00:06:58,641 --> 00:06:58,906
Speaker 0: around.".

98
00:06:59,195 --> 00:06:59,409
Speaker 0: Yeah.

99
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,550
Speaker 0: And we want to play Puerto Rico with Steve Jackson.

100
00:07:01,915 --> 00:07:02,022
Speaker 1: Yeah.

101
00:07:02,731 --> 00:07:07,629
Speaker 1: I don't know what actually convinced us to go back early, because no one wanted to go back except him.

102
00:07:07,934 --> 00:07:08,019
Speaker 0: Yeah.

103
00:07:08,531 --> 00:07:09,450
Speaker 0: We should have stayed faster.

104
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:14,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, for some reason, we ended up going back early, and as a result, we missed playing Puerto Rico with Steve Jackson.

105
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:21,669
Speaker 0: I think the final deal he made with us is that we would help him clean up the chaos, and then he would play Puerto Rico with us.

106
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:22,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were all set to do that.

107
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,250
Speaker 0: And he had never played Puerto Rico before.

108
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:30,890
Speaker 0: We were going to show him the amazingness of Puerto Rico, and we could have influenced future Steve Jackson game designs, and who knows what would have happened.

109
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:31,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, you never know.

110
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,789
Speaker 1: Maybe this would have been the Steve Jackson podcast.

111
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,464
Speaker 0: Steve Jackson finally makes an awesome game.

112
00:07:36,484 --> 00:07:37,430
Speaker 0: that's not just random.

113
00:07:39,271 --> 00:07:42,810
Speaker 0: No, some of his games are fun, but they're not hardcore, super German games.

114
00:07:42,931 --> 00:07:45,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, Illuminati is probably the closest, all things considered.

115
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,262
Speaker 0: Yep, yep, yep.

116
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:51,569
Speaker 0: But yeah, that's the story of us almost playing Puerto Rico with Steve Jackson.

117
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,530
Speaker 1: This was also in kind of our earlier days of going to cons.

118
00:07:55,773 --> 00:07:57,549
Speaker 0: And our earlier days of German board gaming.

119
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:05,108
Speaker 1: Yeah, we weren't so hip to how to make a con awesome, so we didn't stand our ground and say, "Screw you, James, we're going to stay and do all this fun

120
00:08:05,128 --> 00:08:05,370
Speaker 1: stuff.".

121
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:18,049
Speaker 1: Nowadays, I mean, now, you should see in the forum, we have a private thread for all the front row crew who are actually going to Otacon, the sheer amount of planning and rules and dictation that has gone on as to what's going on.

122
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:28,006
Speaker 1: Like, you will show up at the hotel at this time, you will pay me this money before you get into the door, you are liable to pay regardless of whether or not you arrive at the con, etcetera, etcetera.

123
00:08:28,451 --> 00:08:33,785
Speaker 1: If someone, if we don't stand for any delay or any problems when we go to conventions now.

124
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:37,769
Speaker 0: Yeah, and pretty much if anyone screws up, they're not allowed back with us.

125
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:39,028
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

126
00:08:40,051 --> 00:08:44,890
Speaker 1: Which is kind of cool, we've had people over the years who have heard about how smoothly our con experience goes.

127
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:45,430
Speaker 1: I'm not kidding.

128
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:50,026
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are people, you know, cause generally I don't think anyone in our group has screwed up yet.

129
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:53,270
Speaker 0: No, we've never- Not royally enough to be kicked out of the group.

130
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,590
Speaker 1: We have never told someone they were not welcome to come back to a con with us.

131
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,189
Speaker 0: Yeah, yet.

132
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,429
Speaker 0: But we would, if you screwed up badly enough.

133
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:04,185
Speaker 0: But the point is, is that other people are, you know, go to cons with other groups of people.

134
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:09,810
Speaker 0: And, you know, those groups of people screw up and their con experience is diminished as a result.

135
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:17,366
Speaker 0: And some of those people who are awesome and they hate the fact that the group they go to the con with sucks, they've come over to our group and been like,

136
00:09:17,386 --> 00:09:18,110
Speaker 0: "Hooray!".

137
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:23,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're not gonna mention names, but one of them actually said, like they were saying all the horrible things that were going on in the room.

138
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:28,785
Speaker 1: You know, drama and people fighting and didn't have enough money and the room cost more than they expected and blah, blah, blah.

139
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:35,827
Speaker 1: And then they came and hung out in our room for a bit and they said something to the effect of, "Wow, I should just stay with you

140
00:09:35,888 --> 00:09:36,170
Speaker 1: guys.".

141
00:09:36,392 --> 00:09:37,705
Speaker 1: And then I said, "Yes, you

142
00:09:37,766 --> 00:09:38,049
Speaker 1: should!".

143
00:09:38,252 --> 00:09:38,707
Speaker 1: You know what?

144
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:41,268
Speaker 1: Any number of people can stay with us.

145
00:09:41,891 --> 00:09:44,169
Speaker 1: We can get as many rooms as we need.

146
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,010
Speaker 1: We have a crazy party every year and it's always awesome.

147
00:09:47,896 --> 00:09:48,170
Speaker 0: Indeed.

148
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:56,110
Speaker 1: The problem is, now our crew, if it weren't for the fact that some people who went last year can't make it this year, we would have needed all three rooms.

149
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,287
Speaker 0: Yep, yep.

150
00:09:59,311 --> 00:10:08,390
Speaker 0: Anyway, so also at PenguinCon 2.0, as a side note, Mayfair Games was there, which I didn't realize until much too late in the convention.

151
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:12,630
Speaker 0: And a guy from Mayfair Games taught us how to play Tigris and Euphrates.

152
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:14,250
Speaker 1: And it was fantastic.

153
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:15,970
Speaker 0: It was indeed fantastic.

154
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,790
Speaker 1: And I like how he seemed to pick on the fact that we were really into board gaming.

155
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:24,630
Speaker 0: It's like we went over and they were sitting at a table with a giant settler set.

156
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,487
Speaker 0: You know, now you can go buy that giant settler set for like 200 bucks?

157
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,469
Speaker 1: This was the prototype of that.

158
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, they had it on a table and they were playing it.

159
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,585
Speaker 0: And I was like, "Whoa, I'll buy that for 100

160
00:10:33,585 --> 00:10:33,686
Speaker 0: bucks.".

161
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,324
Speaker 0: And they were like, "No, not

162
00:10:35,365 --> 00:10:35,567
Speaker 0: enough.".

163
00:10:36,311 --> 00:10:38,326
Speaker 0: And I'm like, "Oh, then it's not worth it, but it's still

164
00:10:38,447 --> 00:10:38,729
Speaker 0: awesome.".

165
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:40,105
Speaker 0: And they were like, "Ah,

166
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:40,429
Speaker 0: thanks.".

167
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:49,505
Speaker 0: And then we walked over to the table full of games to find a game to play and we picked up Tigris and Euphrates because I had heard it was a great classic game and we had never played it.

168
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,306
Speaker 1: Yep, and we're talking about the game like, "Ooh, it looks like a tile game,

169
00:10:52,367 --> 00:10:52,669
Speaker 1: ooh-da-doo.".

170
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:57,434
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we bring it over to the other side of the room and a guy from Mayfair just appears and he's like,

171
00:10:57,455 --> 00:10:58,361
Speaker 0: "Ahhh.".

172
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,847
Speaker 1: And he's like, "You know what the deal is with this

173
00:11:01,887 --> 00:11:02,150
Speaker 1: game?".

174
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,749
Speaker 0: And he bestowed his wisdom upon us.

175
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:10,329
Speaker 0: Also, we kind of needed him because there were two sets of T&E in the box and we would have gotten messed up if he wasn't there.

176
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:15,068
Speaker 1: Yep, plus he taught us how to play the game in the manner that we usually teach other people how to play games.

177
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,721
Speaker 1: Like, the very efficient bam, bam, bam.

178
00:11:17,902 --> 00:11:22,210
Speaker 1: by the time he's finished speaking because he has a practice feel, you know the game and you're ready to play.

179
00:11:22,531 --> 00:11:26,930
Speaker 0: Yep, so thank you anonymous Mayfair Games guy, you're awesome.

180
00:11:27,572 --> 00:11:28,989
Speaker 0: We are T&E fans, thanks to you.

181
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,850
Speaker 1: And Steve Jackson, if you're listening, we're still up for that game of Puerto Rico.

182
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,129
Speaker 0: Yeah, come to Utica.

183
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,189
Speaker 0: Or come to our house.

184
00:11:35,351 --> 00:11:36,309
Speaker 0: Even though you live in Texas.

185
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:46,610
Speaker 1: And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.
