1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,148
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, October 26th, 2011.

2
00:00:10,148 --> 00:00:10,309
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,503 --> 00:00:12,899
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,100
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights tonight because I am actually in Japan.

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:22,801
Speaker 0: We are continuing with our coverage of the new 52, week 2.

6
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:22,989
Speaker 1: Boogaloo.

7
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:26,948
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

8
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,543
Speaker 0: So as promised, week 2 of the 52.

9
00:00:33,543 --> 00:00:35,130
Speaker 0: We'll just go right down the list.

10
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,242
Speaker 1: I can't wait for this to be over.

11
00:00:36,424 --> 00:00:36,768
Speaker 1: Alright, so...

12
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,710
Speaker 0: I feel like week 1 was... better?

13
00:00:39,811 --> 00:00:42,430
Speaker 0: Like, I enjoyed reading week 1.

14
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:46,129
Speaker 1: According to my... I don't remember, 'cause it's... or I read these a while ago.

15
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:52,910
Speaker 1: But looking at my little spreadsheet here, week 2 was the worst week by far.

16
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,130
Speaker 0: Week 2 was definitely the worst week.

17
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,229
Speaker 1: Alright, so let's just go into it.

18
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,790
Speaker 1: The first one was Batman and Robin.

19
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:01,930
Speaker 0: So here's what pisses me off.

20
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:02,850
Speaker 1: Yet another Batman book.

21
00:01:02,951 --> 00:01:03,367
Speaker 0: Right away.

22
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:08,790
Speaker 0: Obviously they know Batman is their strongest franchise because Batman is in, like, all these comics.

23
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:10,202
Speaker 1: Yeah, like 30-40% of the books.

24
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,798
Speaker 0: Every Batman is different.

25
00:01:12,838 --> 00:01:15,190
Speaker 0: Like, way different in how he's presented.

26
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,950
Speaker 0: And it's kind of annoying.

27
00:01:17,571 --> 00:01:20,690
Speaker 1: It's not the same Batman in all the different books.

28
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:21,650
Speaker 1: It's the same thing with the Superman.

29
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:22,414
Speaker 1: The action comic.

30
00:01:22,434 --> 00:01:24,770
Speaker 1: Superman was clearly not the Superman in the other books.

31
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,230
Speaker 1: It's like, these are different people here, but you're supposed to try to tell me it's the same person?

32
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,268
Speaker 1: I can't believe it.

33
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:37,570
Speaker 0: The Superman was a little... like, there was too much of him being kind of sardonic and Robin being a punk-ass bitch kid.

34
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:43,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, you don't know if you're getting Mad Batman or Sad Batman or- I was getting, like, Stern Dad Batman.

35
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:44,351
Speaker 1: Right.

36
00:01:44,392 --> 00:01:46,330
Speaker 1: It's like, which one is gonna show up this time?

37
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,430
Speaker 1: You know, I mean, fanfiction does a better job of getting characters right than this.

38
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:56,044
Speaker 1: You know, it's like, if I go read, you know, a fanfiction of, say, Spider-Man, it's gonna be Spider-Man.

39
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,649
Speaker 0: Spider-Man having sex with a tiger version of Spider-Man.

40
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:07,470
Speaker 1: Even though he's doing weird things, his personality will be recognizable as Spider-Man.

41
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:14,570
Speaker 1: 'Cause, you know, when people do fanfiction, it's 'cause they like the character, and they make the character like the character.

42
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,682
Speaker 1: Here, it's like, who is Batman, really?

43
00:02:17,742 --> 00:02:19,430
Speaker 1: What is Batman's personality?

44
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,570
Speaker 0: But a miserable pile of sad.

45
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:26,990
Speaker 1: It depends which of the 13 or 14 different books you read, 'cause there's a different Bruce Wayne in each one.

46
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:31,750
Speaker 0: At least we know that the worst Batman was from last week on Justice League International.

47
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,229
Speaker 0: That was like Guy in Batman's clothes.

48
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,488
Speaker 1: That was Super Friends Batman.

49
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,953
Speaker 0: Maybe that's it.

50
00:02:37,334 --> 00:02:42,450
Speaker 0: There are like 10 guys who are Batman, and they're all actually different.

51
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:52,050
Speaker 1: Well, that actually, I think, from what I understand, is there was a Batman Incorporated something, where there were like franchised Batmans.

52
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,470
Speaker 0: Well, isn't that like Nightwing?

53
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:54,553
Speaker 1: I don't know.

54
00:02:54,573 --> 00:02:57,447
Speaker 1: I think that there were actually Batmans who were not Bruce Wayne.

55
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:58,310
Speaker 1: Is it Batman?

56
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,803
Speaker 1: But the thing is, all of these Batmans are Bruce Wayne.

57
00:03:01,883 --> 00:03:03,670
Speaker 1: Batman Incorporated was like, okay, you're Batman.

58
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,575
Speaker 1: You're another Batman.

59
00:03:04,595 --> 00:03:06,767
Speaker 1: You're Batman Paris or something, but you're not Bruce Wayne.

60
00:03:07,731 --> 00:03:09,990
Speaker 1: These are all supposed to be Bruce Wayne and Batman.

61
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,440
Speaker 0: I guess with this one, the plot started out.

62
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:20,850
Speaker 0: okay, but I really... I don't need to deal with... Batman dealing with his parents' deaths no longer interests me.

63
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,261
Speaker 1: Well, that's something I liked in some of the other books.

64
00:03:23,361 --> 00:03:25,170
Speaker 1: It skipped over the origin bullshit.

65
00:03:26,612 --> 00:03:31,826
Speaker 0: And it kind of kept like, you know, this is the last time I'm going to celebrate the death.

66
00:03:31,887 --> 00:03:33,190
Speaker 0: I'm going to celebrate the life instead.

67
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:37,810
Speaker 0: And that was all neat and good, but it's tired because Batman's a tired old character.

68
00:03:38,912 --> 00:03:45,550
Speaker 0: I don't care anymore that he's sad that his parents were killed by whoever killed them, depending on what continuity you're looking at.

69
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,270
Speaker 1: Okay, so here's the notes that I wrote, right?

70
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:53,370
Speaker 1: So first, a lot of the art looked like they were underwater when they weren't underwater.

71
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,083
Speaker 1: There was like a haze over it or something.

72
00:03:55,104 --> 00:03:55,890
Speaker 1: I don't know what's up with that.

73
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:56,661
Speaker 0: It wasn't that bad though.

74
00:03:56,681 --> 00:03:57,250
Speaker 0: I kind of like the art.

75
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:57,980
Speaker 1: No, it's not too bad.

76
00:03:58,001 --> 00:03:58,610
Speaker 1: It was just average.

77
00:03:59,391 --> 00:04:00,457
Speaker 1: Okay, this is what I understand.

78
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,550
Speaker 1: You have all these different Robins, right?

79
00:04:03,433 --> 00:04:05,250
Speaker 0: I guess they're all dead from the past?

80
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:09,027
Speaker 1: There's like four or five of them, and I think the dead ones are back to life or whatever.

81
00:04:09,107 --> 00:04:09,469
Speaker 1: I don't know.

82
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,577
Speaker 1: But here's the question, right?

83
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:18,010
Speaker 1: That Justice League number one... I keep going back to that Justice League number one because it was the first book that came out, right?

84
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,144
Speaker 1: That Justice League number one was supposed to be how many years ago?

85
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:22,270
Speaker 1: Five years ago.

86
00:04:22,713 --> 00:04:24,188
Speaker 0: So in the span of five years...

87
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,100
Speaker 1: In the span of five years, there are all those Robins?

88
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:26,784
Speaker 1: Really?

89
00:04:26,804 --> 00:04:27,608
Speaker 1: Really?

90
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,280
Speaker 1: Not only that... Really?

91
00:04:30,272 --> 00:04:31,530
Speaker 0: This is supposed to be a number one.

92
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,809
Speaker 1: You started from scratch and you've already fucked it up.

93
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,023
Speaker 0: And I'm fine if you've started in media res.

94
00:04:36,063 --> 00:04:37,110
Speaker 0: I like that, in fact.

95
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:49,630
Speaker 0: But I feel like too many of these number ones are trying to shoehorn in backstory that nerds already know anyway to have an excuse to use it in number twos and number threes.

96
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,819
Speaker 1: And not help itself by shoehorning in Adam West with the bat poles.

97
00:04:53,859 --> 00:04:58,730
Speaker 1: I'm surprised they didn't use the clock to open it and not the Shakespeare bust.

98
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,118
Speaker 0: That was actually part of my problem with this one.

99
00:05:01,298 --> 00:05:04,330
Speaker 0: It was a little too campy in its plot.

100
00:05:05,031 --> 00:05:05,514
Speaker 1: It's weird.

101
00:05:05,534 --> 00:05:08,750
Speaker 1: It tried to take the campiness and put a dark shade in front of it.

102
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,874
Speaker 0: That's exactly what I was going to say.

103
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:14,690
Speaker 0: There's a veneer of dark, badass Batman, but underneath it's Adam West.

104
00:05:15,893 --> 00:05:23,550
Speaker 0: I think the biggest example of that was that the radiation was going to leak out and Batman just totally busts open the pool that happens to be above it.

105
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:26,210
Speaker 1: That might as well have been shark repellent.

106
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:30,327
Speaker 0: When he had the net to catch all the kids who fell through the hole, that did it.

107
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:35,982
Speaker 0: But then they're dark when Robin effectively totally was like, "I'm going to fucking kill those guys.

108
00:05:36,262 --> 00:05:36,944
Speaker 0: Shut up, Batman.

109
00:05:36,964 --> 00:05:37,846
Speaker 0: You're not the boss of me.

110
00:05:38,127 --> 00:05:39,189
Speaker 0: I can kill people if I want

111
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:39,330
Speaker 0: to.".

112
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:42,850
Speaker 1: The other thing I didn't like was there's something going on in Moscow.

113
00:05:44,091 --> 00:05:51,690
Speaker 1: Obviously they're going to tie it in later, but it's like you're reading two separate things going on that aren't related at all within the entire comic.

114
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:56,301
Speaker 1: A comic book is a single work, so you can have that disjoint.

115
00:05:56,402 --> 00:05:58,728
Speaker 1: show me one place, show me the other place over a trade.

116
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,378
Speaker 1: But this is a single comic.

117
00:06:01,418 --> 00:06:03,050
Speaker 1: It has to make sense within itself.

118
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,630
Speaker 1: All that Moscow stuff just felt thrown in and out of nowhere because it never tied together within the entire issue.

119
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:15,310
Speaker 0: Well it did, in that the Moscow guy probably wanted the radioactive doomedads that Batman stopped from being stolen.

120
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:19,730
Speaker 1: The only way you can assume that is because they happen to be in the same book on adjacent pages.

121
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:20,973
Speaker 0: Which is why I assume.

122
00:06:21,073 --> 00:06:26,110
Speaker 0: Also because the guy lowered the two dead guys from before into that vat of acid.

123
00:06:27,092 --> 00:06:30,570
Speaker 0: Which was kind of a weird scene in the way it was drawn.

124
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:32,994
Speaker 0: They're kind of hanging in space.

125
00:06:33,395 --> 00:06:38,650
Speaker 0: It felt like they were going with almost two different styles in Moscow and I guess Gotham.

126
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,530
Speaker 0: Didn't feel like Gotham.

127
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,361
Speaker 1: So anyway, I gave this a meh.

128
00:06:42,421 --> 00:06:43,369
Speaker 1: What did you give this?

129
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:46,299
Speaker 0: I almost want to say it's bad.

130
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,384
Speaker 0: It's not even worth my time.

131
00:06:47,404 --> 00:06:48,167
Speaker 0: I don't care.

132
00:06:48,187 --> 00:06:48,930
Speaker 0: I'm going to say bad.

133
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:49,156
Speaker 1: Oh, bad.

134
00:06:49,282 --> 00:06:49,470
Speaker 1: Alright.

135
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,503
Speaker 0: Because I wouldn't read number two even if we had it.

136
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:54,010
Speaker 0: I just don't care.

137
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:54,873
Speaker 1: I also don't care.

138
00:06:54,893 --> 00:06:55,214
Speaker 1: Alright.

139
00:06:55,857 --> 00:06:56,861
Speaker 1: Batwoman.

140
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:58,107
Speaker 1: Not Batgirl.

141
00:06:58,408 --> 00:06:58,910
Speaker 1: Batwoman.

142
00:06:59,331 --> 00:06:59,692
Speaker 1: Alright.

143
00:07:00,555 --> 00:07:01,999
Speaker 1: I don't remember this really.

144
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:05,810
Speaker 1: It's been a while and I don't have the book on hand to bring it back to memory.

145
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,381
Speaker 0: Batwoman is really pale.

146
00:07:07,421 --> 00:07:08,510
Speaker 0: I don't know anything about Batwoman.

147
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:14,927
Speaker 0: But I was talking to Daryl Surratt about this and he told me that Batwoman, this one, was written before the 52 thing happened.

148
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:16,571
Speaker 1: Really?

149
00:07:16,672 --> 00:07:19,382
Speaker 0: Which is why it kind of just picks up.

150
00:07:19,562 --> 00:07:21,590
Speaker 0: It's funny because it kind of works as number one.

151
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:25,370
Speaker 0: Because it's completely in media res with zero backstory.

152
00:07:25,531 --> 00:07:27,561
Speaker 0: It's just, hey, Batwoman.

153
00:07:28,787 --> 00:07:29,470
Speaker 0: Here's Batwoman.

154
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,381
Speaker 1: I wrote down, let's see, the plot can't stay focused.

155
00:07:32,722 --> 00:07:34,650
Speaker 1: And I wrote down that the art was actually awesome.

156
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,296
Speaker 0: Yeah, it started out really strong.

157
00:07:36,337 --> 00:07:37,763
Speaker 0: Batwoman is investigating the ghost.

158
00:07:37,804 --> 00:07:39,070
Speaker 0: that's drowning people.

159
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:40,994
Speaker 0: Right.

160
00:07:41,035 --> 00:07:45,230
Speaker 1: And there's like a teenage gang or something and she goes after her, right?

161
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,854
Speaker 0: That was like an afterthought.

162
00:07:46,874 --> 00:07:50,745
Speaker 0: It was almost like an Adam West flashback to her and her equivalent of Robin.

163
00:07:52,711 --> 00:07:57,830
Speaker 1: There's like a weird serial killing kind of thing going around and she's chasing it and she ends up at some house.

164
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:02,286
Speaker 0: But independently she's got her Robin who has a superhero name, I guess.

165
00:08:02,366 --> 00:08:03,390
Speaker 0: I don't know anything about the Batwoman.

166
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,857
Speaker 1: I don't think that that person is a Robin.

167
00:08:05,897 --> 00:08:10,390
Speaker 1: I think it's actually a superhero girlfriend from another group or something.

168
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:13,330
Speaker 0: But now she's training to be Batwoman's Robin.

169
00:08:13,831 --> 00:08:14,769
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

170
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:20,746
Speaker 0: But she had a uniform from before and Batwoman seems to do the same dialogue.

171
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,070
Speaker 0: It might as well be Batman.

172
00:08:22,953 --> 00:08:24,870
Speaker 0: When she's in Batwoman mode.

173
00:08:26,816 --> 00:08:28,163
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is bad.

174
00:08:28,183 --> 00:08:29,349
Speaker 1: I don't want it.

175
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,482
Speaker 0: The art was good to a degree.

176
00:08:31,563 --> 00:08:32,450
Speaker 0: I liked the...

177
00:08:32,634 --> 00:08:33,328
Speaker 1: Yeah, the art was great.

178
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:43,030
Speaker 0: I really liked that two page spread of all the people talking around the center image of the kind of drowned woman Rusalka, almost like a stained glass thing.

179
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:46,230
Speaker 0: But otherwise the plot really was not...

180
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,908
Speaker 1: Make an art book, dude.

181
00:08:47,711 --> 00:08:53,870
Speaker 0: If the plot had just straight up been Batwoman investigates the ghost that murders children.

182
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:58,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, they could have concentrated on it and only on like one murder as opposed to the whole string.

183
00:08:59,211 --> 00:09:00,463
Speaker 1: Oh, it could have been the whole string.

184
00:09:00,483 --> 00:09:01,170
Speaker 0: That would have been fine.

185
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:09,110
Speaker 0: If it didn't also have the I'm training a Robin and all that other... If it had just been that story, like one episode of BTAS.

186
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,162
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

187
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:10,488
Speaker 1: I don't know.

188
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,374
Speaker 0: I mean, it was meh.

189
00:09:11,836 --> 00:09:12,560
Speaker 0: It wasn't bad.

190
00:09:12,661 --> 00:09:14,109
Speaker 0: I would read it, but I wouldn't buy it.

191
00:09:15,212 --> 00:09:15,895
Speaker 0: Definitely a meh.

192
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:19,150
Speaker 0: I just... It wasn't grabbing me.

193
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,710
Speaker 1: So far we got meh bad and bad meh.

194
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,850
Speaker 0: And I wonder why she's so pale.

195
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,438
Speaker 1: Alright, so Deathstroke.

196
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:25,949
Speaker 1: I actually remember this.

197
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:27,410
Speaker 0: I like this one kinda.

198
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:27,738
Speaker 0: Really?

199
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,730
Speaker 0: Because it reminded me of Cable.

200
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, it sure did.

201
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:35,810
Speaker 1: Basically you have this, you know, some government, another acronym organization.

202
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:40,370
Speaker 1: He wants to hire, or government thing, wants to hire a guy to do something.

203
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:42,540
Speaker 0: Ah, but Deathstroke's too old.

204
00:09:42,621 --> 00:09:44,530
Speaker 0: It's almost like a Dark Knight Returns situation.

205
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,170
Speaker 1: He's too old for this shit, but he's the ultimate badass assassin guy.

206
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,610
Speaker 1: He gets the job done like Golgo 13.

207
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:51,926
Speaker 0: Alright, obviously spoilers.

208
00:09:51,947 --> 00:09:52,210
Speaker 0: Fuck you guys.

209
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,270
Speaker 1: I actually wrote Golgo 13.

210
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,850
Speaker 0: He basically is Golgo 13.

211
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:02,130
Speaker 0: I kind of actually did not see coming him murdering his entire team at the end of the first issue.

212
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:02,908
Speaker 1: I saw that coming.

213
00:10:03,491 --> 00:10:04,630
Speaker 0: I didn't know anything about this character.

214
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,970
Speaker 1: He was basically... I didn't know anything about him either.

215
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,110
Speaker 1: But I know he's like an incredible badass.

216
00:10:09,851 --> 00:10:11,945
Speaker 1: You know, the loner, awesome assassin Golgo 13 guy.

217
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:16,610
Speaker 1: And suddenly he gets tricked into working with these kids.

218
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:22,522
Speaker 1: Usually in those cases, it's like, you know, the guy will be like, "Oh yeah, I'm not working with these kids.

219
00:10:22,562 --> 00:10:23,309
Speaker 1: Get them the fuck out of

220
00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:23,410
Speaker 1: here.".

221
00:10:23,451 --> 00:10:24,489
Speaker 1: But he actually went along with it.

222
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:27,307
Speaker 1: And as soon as he went along with it, I'm like, "Oh, they're all gonna

223
00:10:27,347 --> 00:10:27,669
Speaker 1: die.".

224
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,410
Speaker 0: Well, I thought they were gonna die.

225
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:33,070
Speaker 1: He wouldn't go along with it if he wasn't gonna teach them a lesson about how he works alone.

226
00:10:33,231 --> 00:10:36,050
Speaker 0: I thought they were going to die in the course of the mission or something.

227
00:10:37,255 --> 00:10:40,010
Speaker 1: If Golgo 13 got an assistant, they would be dead.

228
00:10:40,151 --> 00:10:43,930
Speaker 0: I did not expect them to be murdered by him just outright at the end of the issue.

229
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,429
Speaker 1: Especially since because they weren't superheroes, you knew that they were done.

230
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:56,310
Speaker 1: And then, you know, I was like, you know, when he killed them, I was like, "Oh, the slightly clever idea of instead of them dying on the mission, he killed them.

231
00:10:56,411 --> 00:10:56,795
Speaker 1: Okay.

232
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:57,442
Speaker 1: Cool.

233
00:10:57,705 --> 00:10:58,048
Speaker 1: Whatever.".

234
00:10:58,351 --> 00:11:00,730
Speaker 0: He's a little too stereotypical badass though.

235
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:04,170
Speaker 0: I feel like if I want to read this kind of story, I'll read Golgo 13.

236
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:04,639
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like...

237
00:11:05,351 --> 00:11:10,026
Speaker 0: If I want to read about an emotionless, unstoppable killing machine, that's what I'm gonna read.

238
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:10,672
Speaker 1: Exactly.

239
00:11:10,692 --> 00:11:14,689
Speaker 1: He was such... Even though he was a badass, he was such a vanilla badass.

240
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:20,510
Speaker 1: He didn't have any... At least Deadpool has humor or attempts at humor.

241
00:11:21,011 --> 00:11:22,049
Speaker 1: You know, failed attempts.

242
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,189
Speaker 1: At least there is an attempt.

243
00:11:23,852 --> 00:11:24,810
Speaker 1: They don't even try.

244
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,390
Speaker 1: It's just like, he's just a badass.

245
00:11:26,751 --> 00:11:31,350
Speaker 1: There's no... Even Golgo 13 has a style with his quiet and his dot, dot, dot.

246
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,930
Speaker 1: And he's always raping some girl or whatever.

247
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,129
Speaker 1: But this guy had nothing other than, "I kill people and I awesome at

248
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:38,209
Speaker 1: it.".

249
00:11:38,471 --> 00:11:39,377
Speaker 0: "And I work alone.

250
00:11:39,397 --> 00:11:40,747
Speaker 0: I'm not too old for this

251
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:41,028
Speaker 0: shit.".

252
00:11:41,292 --> 00:11:41,483
Speaker 1: Right.

253
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:46,090
Speaker 1: Also, did you notice on the one page, they threw in a J. Jonas Jameson?

254
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:46,594
Speaker 1: It's like,

255
00:11:46,635 --> 00:11:46,858
Speaker 1: "What?".

256
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:48,930
Speaker 1: This is Marvel Comics, dude.

257
00:11:51,671 --> 00:12:00,130
Speaker 0: Otherwise, the actual action that was going on when he boards that plane, it reminded me of Air Force One in that it was kind of...

258
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:04,926
Speaker 1: Yeah, boarding the plane in flight is an old, "We need the extreme action scene.

259
00:12:04,967 --> 00:12:05,309
Speaker 1: Let's do

260
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:05,490
Speaker 1: this.".

261
00:12:06,033 --> 00:12:13,589
Speaker 0: But the action was otherwise just kind of lame, and they threw in the weird alien plot and then immediately forgot about the word alien plot.

262
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,179
Speaker 0: Granted, it's one issue.

263
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,690
Speaker 0: I'm sure that's gonna come back.

264
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:18,310
Speaker 1: Obviously.

265
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:21,249
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had no intention of reading this.

266
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,590
Speaker 0: Why didn't they just fucking shoot the plane down?

267
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:26,350
Speaker 0: They did not need to send him onto the plane.

268
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,470
Speaker 1: 'Cause it wouldn't have made it such a badass action scene.

269
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,970
Speaker 1: He wouldn't have been a badass if he just shot a rocket at a plane.

270
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:31,628
Speaker 0: It's just, it's meh.

271
00:12:32,475 --> 00:12:32,923
Speaker 1: I put meh.

272
00:12:34,052 --> 00:12:34,749
Speaker 0: I put meh on it.

273
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:41,069
Speaker 0: Because I wouldn't mind knowing what he does next.

274
00:12:43,099 --> 00:12:43,548
Speaker 1: If someone told me.

275
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,609
Speaker 1: I just don't care at all.

276
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:50,850
Speaker 0: See, I can't say bad on something like this, because I got other things to say bad about.

277
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:54,610
Speaker 1: Right, well, if he had some character to him, I would have put maybe even good.

278
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:58,209
Speaker 1: You know, it was that, that just made the huge difference there.

279
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,705
Speaker 1: It was just that there was no character at all.

280
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,369
Speaker 1: In fact, those kids that died had actual character to them.

281
00:13:05,313 --> 00:13:08,050
Speaker 0: They were a stereotypical 24 assistant, basically.

282
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,462
Speaker 1: Yeah, but actually I would have rather read a book about them, would have been meh.

283
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,289
Speaker 0: You just read a book about them.

284
00:13:13,491 --> 00:13:15,250
Speaker 1: But a book about Deathstroke would have been bad.

285
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:16,408
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's bad.

286
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,610
Speaker 1: Alright, so, Demon Knights.

287
00:13:20,191 --> 00:13:26,230
Speaker 0: So, this is just straight up fantasy, but it's written like superhero comic.

288
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:33,590
Speaker 1: Right, that's, it was so weird, 'cause like, when it started getting all fantasy, I was like, oh, actually, I'm kind of- This is, like, I was kind of digging it, like, alright.

289
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,922
Speaker 1: Like, even though it's a little bit of that R.A.

290
00:13:35,963 --> 00:13:37,350
Speaker 1: Salvatore kind of fantasy.

291
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:40,085
Speaker 0: But, like, the bad guys had their thing.

292
00:13:40,106 --> 00:13:45,270
Speaker 0: where they're, you get the sense that they're conflicted villains, like, they're doing evil for a greater good.

293
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,970
Speaker 0: At least, they believe it to be a greater good.

294
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:52,510
Speaker 1: Actually, it felt almost like a slayers plot without the comedy.

295
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:57,109
Speaker 0: I was also reminded slightly of, take the plot of Bone, not the character.

296
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,786
Speaker 1: Like a light surface level fantasy.

297
00:13:59,807 --> 00:14:03,510
Speaker 1: that's not, it's not, you know, a Lord of the Rings or a Prince of Nothing.

298
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:07,450
Speaker 1: It's just an adventury party going to stabby stabby, you know?

299
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:11,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, like, the child's death was regrettable, and all this, the villains were conflicted.

300
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:13,970
Speaker 0: Also, the cover art was hideous.

301
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,449
Speaker 1: I looked at the cover, and I was like, blech.

302
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,350
Speaker 1: But then, when I looked in the book, I was like, oh, this is pretty great.

303
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:25,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, I liked seeing Merlin, and I liked how the demon is like, uh, yeah, the guy who I'm possessing is kind of a fuckwit, but whatever.

304
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:36,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, and he talks, they're in the inn, and the inn explodes, of course, and the girl is like, you know, she acts like she's friends with the guy who's possessed by the demon, sort of a birdie the mighty, almost.

305
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,729
Speaker 1: But then when the demon comes out, she's like, yeah, let's just not let that jerk know.

306
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:40,829
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like it rough.

307
00:14:42,092 --> 00:14:45,919
Speaker 0: They start making out, and then they fight, and then at the end, it's like, but it got a little derpy.

308
00:14:45,939 --> 00:14:49,610
Speaker 0: at the end, when the villains are like, we'll do what we always do when there's a problem.

309
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:54,170
Speaker 0: We throw dragons at it, and then, oh, shit, a dragon appears and attacks the inn.

310
00:14:54,250 --> 00:15:00,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that, you know, that derpiness combined with the fact that the plot was a little bit all over the place.

311
00:15:00,773 --> 00:15:01,519
Speaker 1: It didn't have enough focus.

312
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:02,668
Speaker 1: I think that's what put it to meh.

313
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:09,290
Speaker 1: If they would've just made it, like, you know, kept with that fantasy aspect more strongly, it could've been good, but it's meh.

314
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:13,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would like it, but they got too much superhero on my fantasy.

315
00:15:13,771 --> 00:15:14,948
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it's--.

316
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:18,230
Speaker 0: Also, the action scenes, where they're actually fighting in the inn, were pretty incomprehensible.

317
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:29,367
Speaker 0: Like, I couldn't tell what was going on, and I lost track of who was who, and it kept, like, focusing on all these other people that I worry that maybe people who know these characters would recognize them, but I had no idea.

318
00:15:30,131 --> 00:15:35,290
Speaker 1: I'd known about the demon, 'cause he was in Wednesday comics, but the Wednesday comics is nothing like this at all.

319
00:15:35,571 --> 00:15:36,949
Speaker 1: It might as well have been a separate character.

320
00:15:38,735 --> 00:15:39,730
Speaker 0: So, it came down to meh.

321
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,306
Speaker 1: It's like demon Etrigan, yeah, meh.

322
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:41,925
Speaker 0: Yeah.

323
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,550
Speaker 1: Could've been good.

324
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:44,375
Speaker 1: Could've been good.

325
00:15:44,415 --> 00:15:45,061
Speaker 1: Had potential.

326
00:15:45,363 --> 00:15:46,150
Speaker 1: Unfulfilled potential.

327
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,950
Speaker 0: So, let's talk about the other Jeff Lemire.

328
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,525
Speaker 1: So, Jeff Lemire, who has so far done no wrong.

329
00:15:51,691 --> 00:15:52,449
Speaker 0: Agent of acronym.

330
00:15:53,132 --> 00:15:54,429
Speaker 1: Agent of acronym group.

331
00:15:55,692 --> 00:16:00,349
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the first, if you notice, like, the first two pages actually look like a Jeff Lemire book.

332
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:00,722
Speaker 1: They do.

333
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:10,230
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure he drew those first two pages, especially that second page looks a lot like the sweet tooth, you know, with that dead dog there and everything, and the monsters coming out of the woods, right?

334
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,283
Speaker 1: So, I was reading these first three pages, and I'm like, "Yeah, Jeff Lemire, all

335
00:16:13,323 --> 00:16:13,546
Speaker 1: right.".

336
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:17,740
Speaker 1: After those first three pages, it's like, "Is it still Jeff

337
00:16:17,761 --> 00:16:18,284
Speaker 1: Lemire?"

338
00:16:18,304 --> 00:16:18,405
Speaker 1: Right?

339
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:23,090
Speaker 0: It's like-- Yeah, I kind of wish it would've kept up with what it was doing.

340
00:16:23,271 --> 00:16:27,970
Speaker 0: It turned into a weird-- It reminds me of manga.

341
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:29,149
Speaker 1: Really?

342
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,930
Speaker 1: Like, random-- I was not reminded of that at all.

343
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:41,210
Speaker 0: Partly because the mad scientist put himself in the body of a schoolgirl, and-- Okay, yeah, that visual aspect, sure.

344
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:44,469
Speaker 0: And just kind of the way the mad scientist talked.

345
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,089
Speaker 0: It reminded me of Washu from Tenchi Muyo.

346
00:16:47,398 --> 00:16:47,648
Speaker 1: Okay.

347
00:16:48,255 --> 00:16:48,547
Speaker 0: A lot.

348
00:16:49,432 --> 00:16:54,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, this reminded me more of, like, crappy Hellboy wannabe, right?

349
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,089
Speaker 1: I think Jeff Lemire was definitely phoning it in on this.

350
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,429
Speaker 1: Or at least I feel like he was.

351
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:07,707
Speaker 1: It's just like, "Okay, "acronym org science organization "gets a group of powerful guys together "to go fight acronym bad guy

352
00:17:07,728 --> 00:17:07,970
Speaker 1: organization.".

353
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:12,010
Speaker 0: Now, it could've been fun if it had been a little more over the top.

354
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,030
Speaker 0: Exactly, that's true.

355
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,730
Speaker 0: It didn't go over the top enough.

356
00:17:15,132 --> 00:17:20,210
Speaker 1: Right, it's like you had this mummy who was kind of silly and mysterious and some of these other characters, right?

357
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:21,510
Speaker 0: And Franklin sounds like, "Where's my wife?

358
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:23,185
Speaker 0: "Oh, whatever, I'm too old for this

359
00:17:23,204 --> 00:17:23,347
Speaker 0: shit.".

360
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,470
Speaker 1: But see, that's what I'm saying.

361
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,150
Speaker 1: It's like Hellboy goes to the extremes.

362
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:33,730
Speaker 1: He either gets the really funny BPRD kind of Hellboy wisecracking or the incredibly dark Cthulhu Hellboy, right?

363
00:17:34,132 --> 00:17:37,090
Speaker 1: This was just sort of in between with both at the same time.

364
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:41,430
Speaker 1: Hellboy shows you one and then the other, you know, back and forth.

365
00:17:41,571 --> 00:17:45,048
Speaker 1: This had them both at the same time all the time in the middle.

366
00:17:46,137 --> 00:17:48,030
Speaker 0: It never felt dark or serious.

367
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,610
Speaker 0: It just felt like it was trying to be funny.

368
00:17:51,231 --> 00:17:57,330
Speaker 0: I mean, the whole explanation of we made our base in this tiny microscopic bullshit explanation.

369
00:17:58,033 --> 00:18:00,610
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, this is the one with the base and the floating ball, right?

370
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,469
Speaker 1: Are you seriously telling me no one just come and smash that fucking thing?

371
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:07,429
Speaker 0: You don't need to explain your bullshit to me.

372
00:18:07,915 --> 00:18:10,250
Speaker 0: and if you're gonna explain it, explain it in context.

373
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,970
Speaker 0: Don't just, you know, tell me it and it's stupid.

374
00:18:14,313 --> 00:18:15,606
Speaker 1: And it didn't matter at all.

375
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,250
Speaker 0: Maybe if it didn't matter.

376
00:18:17,653 --> 00:18:22,510
Speaker 0: Like, if they'd explained that and then like four pages later Frankenstein ate it or something, that would've been awesome.

377
00:18:23,215 --> 00:18:24,130
Speaker 0: But they didn't do that.

378
00:18:25,593 --> 00:18:27,170
Speaker 1: Just a bunch of proper nouns and nonsense.

379
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:34,509
Speaker 0: I don't want to say bad because I kind of like the art, but I don't want to read more of it because I just don't give a shit.

380
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:35,429
Speaker 1: I put bad.

381
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,890
Speaker 1: Jeff Lemire, you know, no one's perfect.

382
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:43,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm gonna agree with you and put bad because I'm not gonna read more.

383
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,088
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

384
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,039
Speaker 0: So, alright.

385
00:18:45,447 --> 00:18:45,610
Speaker 0: Alright.

386
00:18:46,053 --> 00:18:49,790
Speaker 0: I feel like we should do Green Lantern number one and Red Lanterns together.

387
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:51,250
Speaker 1: Okay, we can skip around.

388
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,570
Speaker 1: So, Green Lantern.

389
00:18:54,232 --> 00:18:57,410
Speaker 0: You told me that these were 52 number ones.

390
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:02,630
Speaker 0: That this, I can start reading this and I don't need to know about your universe.

391
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,970
Speaker 0: So, who the fuck is Sinestro?

392
00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:07,950
Speaker 1: I think it's Sinestro.

393
00:19:10,132 --> 00:19:12,510
Speaker 0: This made no goddamn sense.

394
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:16,010
Speaker 0: I might as well have picked up Green Lantern issue 1008.

395
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:16,668
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

396
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:24,610
Speaker 1: This is, you know, go listen to our episode we did about Green Lantern Rebirth because this Green Lantern is still the same shit even though it's how many issues later.

397
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:25,747
Speaker 1: Same crap.

398
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:31,390
Speaker 0: Like, everything is explained in the stupid derpy comic book superhero way.

399
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,388
Speaker 0: All these characters, I don't know who they are.

400
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:34,990
Speaker 0: Pointless exposition.

401
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,510
Speaker 0: Ludicrous space sector gobbledygook bullshit.

402
00:19:39,414 --> 00:19:39,949
Speaker 0: What the hell?

403
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:48,270
Speaker 1: This doesn't even seem to... And the thing is, at least it partially makes sense even though I know so little about Green Lantern.

404
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:48,894
Speaker 1: Oh, it does.

405
00:19:49,036 --> 00:19:50,530
Speaker 0: Obviously, this is a bad guy.

406
00:19:50,911 --> 00:20:00,490
Speaker 0: Who is forced to be a good guy, doesn't want to be but he's probably actually really good at heart for whatever reason and he's gonna be the reluctant good guy in the end.

407
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,388
Speaker 1: But here's the thing, right?

408
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,770
Speaker 1: There's two aspects to the continuity, right?

409
00:20:04,351 --> 00:20:09,110
Speaker 1: That, you know, you only get this comic because you read what came before.

410
00:20:09,912 --> 00:20:11,450
Speaker 1: One is the understanding, right?

411
00:20:11,693 --> 00:20:14,810
Speaker 1: I don't know what's going on because I don't know the history of Green Lantern.

412
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,210
Speaker 1: This doesn't have that problem that much.

413
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,529
Speaker 1: It has a little bit, but not that much.

414
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:24,450
Speaker 1: The problem it really has is I don't care because I haven't read the hit, right?

415
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:33,830
Speaker 1: It's like, unless you're already invested and you care about these characters and already know about them, unless you already care, this comic has no meaning for you.

416
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:42,489
Speaker 1: It's like, what's the emotional impact of this guy saying this thing if I don't already care about Green Lanterns?

417
00:20:42,711 --> 00:20:43,790
Speaker 0: And I don't care.

418
00:20:44,131 --> 00:20:47,485
Speaker 1: It only has an emotional impact if you already know and care.

419
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:56,347
Speaker 1: So even if you understand it, the fact that you don't care makes the whole comic just completely vacant of anything.

420
00:20:57,811 --> 00:20:59,450
Speaker 0: I read it and I felt nothing at the end.

421
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:03,629
Speaker 0: Green Lantern is bad, but it bothers me too.

422
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:09,647
Speaker 0: I don't like continuity between, you know, comics, the whole "I gotta read all these comics to make sense of it,".

423
00:21:10,171 --> 00:21:15,810
Speaker 0: but the Green Lantern stuff going on in all the other DC comics seems to have no goddamn relation to this Green Lantern stuff.

424
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:18,610
Speaker 1: Well, that's no different from the Batman or the Superman stuff.

425
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,135
Speaker 0: But it's like almost negative continuity.

426
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:27,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, see, this is, you know, I was surprised at some of the other Geoff Johns books.

427
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:29,084
Speaker 1: I've always hated everything he's ever done, you know.

428
00:21:31,294 --> 00:21:35,510
Speaker 1: We're actually kind of okay, but this one is typical Geoff Johns, don't give a shit.

429
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:39,530
Speaker 0: But as bad as Green Lantern was, Red Lantern takes the page.

430
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,518
Speaker 1: Was somehow worse.

431
00:21:40,538 --> 00:21:41,930
Speaker 1: Like, I wish I had double bad.

432
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:45,209
Speaker 0: First off, I gotta bring this up again.

433
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:53,710
Speaker 0: There's a page when the woman, the Red Lantern woman with the gigantic boobs and the skeleton wings What page number is it?

434
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,089
Speaker 0: There's no page numbers.

435
00:21:55,790 --> 00:22:06,290
Speaker 0: It is page, let's see, if I count every page other than the cover, including the ads, but not including the cover piece of paper, one, two, three, four, five, six.

436
00:22:06,671 --> 00:22:08,769
Speaker 0: On page seven, she's picking poop out of her butt.

437
00:22:09,334 --> 00:22:09,887
Speaker 1: She sure is.

438
00:22:10,351 --> 00:22:12,530
Speaker 0: She just pulled her finger out of her butt and there's poop on it.

439
00:22:12,713 --> 00:22:13,107
Speaker 1: There is.

440
00:22:13,852 --> 00:22:14,488
Speaker 1: What the fuck?

441
00:22:15,111 --> 00:22:15,629
Speaker 1: What the fuck?

442
00:22:15,972 --> 00:22:16,870
Speaker 1: There's no other way to interpret that.

443
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,430
Speaker 1: That's one of those accidental arts, right?

444
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,429
Speaker 1: Because he just drew someone in a typical comic pose.

445
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:21,589
Speaker 0: But why did they draw the poop?

446
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:28,470
Speaker 1: He drew the typical comic pose of someone with their hand in a claw behind them to be menacing, like, ahh, right?

447
00:22:29,111 --> 00:22:33,290
Speaker 1: And it just so happened that the hand is supposed to be in front of the butt.

448
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:34,050
Speaker 1: Not on the butt.

449
00:22:34,913 --> 00:22:38,310
Speaker 1: But the finger happens to align with the edge of the butt.

450
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:42,250
Speaker 1: And they also did that thing where there's sort of sparks coming off the finger.

451
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,488
Speaker 1: But they're black poop sparks.

452
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:47,250
Speaker 1: It's because the finger's near the butt and the sparks.

453
00:22:47,431 --> 00:22:49,789
Speaker 1: it looks like she just picked some dingleberries out.

454
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:53,290
Speaker 0: There are not black poop sparks on her other hand or on any of her other fingers.

455
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,309
Speaker 0: It is just the finger that just picked the butt.

456
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,109
Speaker 0: And I don't know what's going on.

457
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:05,370
Speaker 0: There's, I guess there's a bunch of red lanterns and they're all insane except for one of them?

458
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,669
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just like there's a pack of wild dogs.

459
00:23:08,451 --> 00:23:13,349
Speaker 0: And they're almost, like, they say weird stuff like they're trying to think, but they can't.

460
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,130
Speaker 0: They're full of rage and they're fighting with each other all the time.

461
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:20,350
Speaker 1: I think the red lanterns are supposed to be, if my understanding is correct, the rage, right?

462
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,810
Speaker 1: Each lantern is supposed to mean something.

463
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,670
Speaker 0: But the main red lantern doesn't have this problem.

464
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:27,550
Speaker 1: So it's like red lantern is rage and I think orange is greedy or something.

465
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,770
Speaker 0: But the main red lantern is totally, like, with it.

466
00:23:29,871 --> 00:23:31,750
Speaker 0: And he's just kind of, like, musing over things.

467
00:23:32,251 --> 00:23:38,270
Speaker 0: But then, like, a fever pod explodes nearby and covers him in blood and the pain is unbearable.

468
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,103
Speaker 0: And I just, fever pod?

469
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:40,870
Speaker 0: Like, what?

470
00:23:41,371 --> 00:23:44,090
Speaker 1: Is this the one where the rings started running away from people?

471
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,009
Speaker 1: Or is that a different one?

472
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:45,529
Speaker 0: That's the other one.

473
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:45,970
Speaker 1: Okay.

474
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:50,210
Speaker 0: This is just weird bullshit.

475
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:51,103
Speaker 1: Let me see it again.

476
00:23:51,124 --> 00:23:51,450
Speaker 1: I haven't looked.

477
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:55,984
Speaker 0: And then it cuts to this weird flashback where the red lantern guy's like, "My whole sector got wiped

478
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:56,267
Speaker 0: out."

479
00:23:56,711 --> 00:23:59,270
Speaker 0: And it shows his family getting killed in front of his eyes.

480
00:24:00,391 --> 00:24:06,910
Speaker 0: That is one of the most derpy, poorly executed examples of that I've ever seen.

481
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:07,272
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.

482
00:24:07,292 --> 00:24:10,090
Speaker 1: There's, like, nothing really happens in this at all, does it?

483
00:24:10,171 --> 00:24:11,090
Speaker 1: No, other than the poop.

484
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,309
Speaker 1: Like, I'm flipping through it and, like, there's nothing that happens.

485
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:16,115
Speaker 1: It's basically just a bunch of red lanterns going, "RAH!

486
00:24:16,135 --> 00:24:16,822
Speaker 1: We're red lanterns!

487
00:24:16,883 --> 00:24:17,328
Speaker 1: RAAH!".

488
00:24:17,631 --> 00:24:19,625
Speaker 0: Yep, and the guy's saying, "It sucks.

489
00:24:19,766 --> 00:24:20,169
Speaker 0: Everything's

490
00:24:20,189 --> 00:24:20,350
Speaker 0: pain.".

491
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:20,793
Speaker 1: And what the fuck?

492
00:24:20,813 --> 00:24:23,570
Speaker 1: This cat, the double-page spread of the cat lantern?

493
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:27,510
Speaker 1: It's like, that cat lantern is there just for, like, fanboy appeal.

494
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:28,189
Speaker 1: Poop got a single page.

495
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,803
Speaker 0: Like, "Oh my god, there's a cat lantern!

496
00:24:30,066 --> 00:24:30,368
Speaker 0: Lulz!

497
00:24:31,091 --> 00:24:32,321
Speaker 1: They should have made the cat long.

498
00:24:32,361 --> 00:24:32,885
Speaker 1: It would have been

499
00:24:32,925 --> 00:24:33,248
Speaker 1: funnier.".

500
00:24:33,591 --> 00:24:38,587
Speaker 0: I just... Naito manga makes more sense than this red lantern.

501
00:24:38,608 --> 00:24:38,990
Speaker 0: I just read.

502
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:45,570
Speaker 0: However, this red lantern still is a paragon of linear storytelling compared to Legion Lost.

503
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:46,798
Speaker 1: You want to go to Legion?

504
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:47,769
Speaker 1: Alright, Legion Lost.

505
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,209
Speaker 0: Oh, I guess we didn't actually review that yet, did we?

506
00:24:50,431 --> 00:24:51,183
Speaker 1: No, do you want to?

507
00:24:51,203 --> 00:24:51,589
Speaker 1: Let's go to it.

508
00:24:51,975 --> 00:24:52,687
Speaker 0: Give me my list back.

509
00:24:54,734 --> 00:24:55,369
Speaker 0: Legion Lost.

510
00:24:56,151 --> 00:24:57,088
Speaker 0: I wrote notes for these.

511
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,930
Speaker 1: Legion Lost is the worst.

512
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:02,470
Speaker 0: So I gotta say, I wrote a note for another one.

513
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:06,689
Speaker 0: I threw away the notes I wrote from week one, since we're already passed on week two.

514
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,849
Speaker 0: But for one of the other entries, I wrote, "What the

515
00:25:09,869 --> 00:25:09,970
Speaker 0: fuck?".

516
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:12,547
Speaker 0: Oh, Olmec, I wrote, and I quote, "What the fuck did I just

517
00:25:12,607 --> 00:25:12,809
Speaker 0: read?".

518
00:25:13,239 --> 00:25:13,447
Speaker 1: Yeah.

519
00:25:14,351 --> 00:25:18,350
Speaker 0: I wrote that again and underlined it for Legion Lost.

520
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,303
Speaker 1: Okay, so Legion Lost, here's my youngest.

521
00:25:20,343 --> 00:25:20,948
Speaker 1: read my notes.

522
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:21,190
Speaker 1: Ready?

523
00:25:22,431 --> 00:25:22,745
Speaker 1: Samoflange.

524
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,970
Speaker 1: Flashpoint Breakwall, proper nouns.

525
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:31,070
Speaker 0: The girl with the antennas who transforms all the time is kind of cute.

526
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,334
Speaker 1: "What is after release?

527
00:25:32,414 --> 00:25:33,156
Speaker 1: Bad art.

528
00:25:33,397 --> 00:25:36,588
Speaker 1: At least the others that weren't really number one were

529
00:25:36,628 --> 00:25:37,290
Speaker 1: comprehensible.".

530
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:43,530
Speaker 1: I actually asked people at Comic-Con, I went to a guy that I know knows more DC Comics stuff than anyone.

531
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,224
Speaker 1: And I asked him, "Legion

532
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:45,688
Speaker 1: Lost."

533
00:25:46,131 --> 00:25:51,769
Speaker 1: And he's like, "Yeah, there are even people who know all about the Legion that couldn't understand what the fuck was going

534
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:51,890
Speaker 1: on.".

535
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:54,636
Speaker 0: Daryl Surratt said it best.

536
00:25:54,978 --> 00:26:02,030
Speaker 0: It is a number one, and we were talking on chat today, in that it's as incomprehensible as any other number one in Legion Lost.

537
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:16,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, from what I understand, the Legion of Superheroes is basically, in some years in the future, way in the future, from the ranks of the DC Universe, there's a whole legion of superheroes, like this big super team, right?

538
00:26:17,231 --> 00:26:21,190
Speaker 1: And they have flight rings, so even if they can't fly, they all get rings so they can fly.

539
00:26:21,432 --> 00:26:22,970
Speaker 0: Because otherwise, I don't know.

540
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,999
Speaker 1: And they all get sent, and there's a ton of them.

541
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,863
Speaker 1: Tons of them.

542
00:26:25,944 --> 00:26:27,170
Speaker 1: And they're all in this one team.

543
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:29,678
Speaker 1: Like, imagine if Justice League was all the heroes.

544
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,970
Speaker 1: And they all split up into teams and go on missions in different places.

545
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:42,390
Speaker 1: And, you know, even if you read all the Legion comics in the beginning, even big fans of this sort of, it's almost like a sub-universe.

546
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,209
Speaker 1: Like a demi-universe.

547
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:47,409
Speaker 0: Because they time travel to multiple dimensions all over the place.

548
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:52,250
Speaker 1: They time travel all over the fuck, and there's a ten billion characters, so people don't understand it.

549
00:26:52,410 --> 00:27:05,406
Speaker 1: So this Legion Lost, in particular, is about one group of legionnaires who are in a time bubble, who they travel in time and get trapped in a place, and something happens there.

550
00:27:05,867 --> 00:27:07,050
Speaker 1: That's all I can figure out.

551
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,680
Speaker 0: I don't know if anything actually happened.

552
00:27:09,505 --> 00:27:09,947
Speaker 0: I can't...

553
00:27:10,451 --> 00:27:13,230
Speaker 1: Aren't they trapped there because the time bubble is smashed?

554
00:27:13,872 --> 00:27:14,876
Speaker 1: The time bubble!

555
00:27:14,916 --> 00:27:15,579
Speaker 0: Something's wrong!

556
00:27:15,619 --> 00:27:16,502
Speaker 0: Don't let it crash!

557
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:22,905
Speaker 0: And then it crashes, and some guy yells, "The Time Institute warned the Legion of Superheroes not to ride the time stream,

558
00:27:22,945 --> 00:27:23,527
Speaker 0: Timberwolf!".

559
00:27:24,431 --> 00:27:26,513
Speaker 1: Yeah, first of all, this has- "My bad!

560
00:27:26,593 --> 00:27:29,265
Speaker 0: Baphmadad will control your scuba-doo and kill the

561
00:27:29,325 --> 00:27:29,606
Speaker 0: fuckmadad!".

562
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,143
Speaker 1: That's why I wrote down

563
00:27:31,204 --> 00:27:31,530
Speaker 1: "Baphmadad.".

564
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:40,566
Speaker 0: It's just, everyone says things that can only be described as, "I will hit you, you little guy, with the samoflange, because samoflanges do

565
00:27:40,847 --> 00:27:41,569
Speaker 0: Baphmadad.".

566
00:27:41,931 --> 00:27:50,950
Speaker 1: Right, so, the thing is, this book has something that exemplifies one thing that is a problem across all superhero comics, or many of them, but this has it the most.

567
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:51,609
Speaker 0: It's bad?

568
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,136
Speaker 1: Yes, but it has the character.

569
00:27:54,196 --> 00:27:56,262
Speaker 1: that's not a character at all, right?

570
00:27:56,282 --> 00:27:58,890
Speaker 1: Remember how I talked about how Deathstroke was sort of vanilla?

571
00:27:59,053 --> 00:28:00,030
Speaker 1: But at least he was a badass.

572
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:06,990
Speaker 1: In this, what you have is you basically have people standing there in costumes with powers, right, and names.

573
00:28:07,911 --> 00:28:11,567
Speaker 1: They're a superhero name, a superhero costume, and that's it.

574
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,590
Speaker 1: They don't have any personality or anything.

575
00:28:14,951 --> 00:28:19,250
Speaker 1: You can just shuffle all the characters around between the speech bubbles, and it wouldn't make a difference.

576
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:23,870
Speaker 0: It is much like Final Fantasy VI, where depending on who's in your party, different people say the same line.

577
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:29,870
Speaker 0: Someone needs to say, "I'm sure glad my acting gig at the Time Institute turned into this.

578
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:32,241
Speaker 0: Locate the Daphnorian DNA.

579
00:28:32,562 --> 00:28:33,929
Speaker 0: The ring sensor array isn't

580
00:28:33,949 --> 00:28:34,150
Speaker 0: working.".

581
00:28:34,611 --> 00:28:37,962
Speaker 1: Right, it's like none of the characters, there are no personalities.

582
00:28:38,102 --> 00:28:40,690
Speaker 1: All they are, these characters don't even exist.

583
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:44,463
Speaker 1: They're just visual designs with powers.

584
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:46,350
Speaker 1: That's all they are, and there's just tons of them.

585
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:50,350
Speaker 1: There's tons and tons of characters, but none of them are actually characters.

586
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,915
Speaker 1: Compare this to any good thing ever.

587
00:28:54,876 --> 00:28:56,539
Speaker 1: Look at, say, Lord of the Rings.

588
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:07,241
Speaker 1: Right, it's like they actually have a character to them.

589
00:29:07,261 --> 00:29:09,630
Speaker 1: There's no character to these characters.

590
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:16,370
Speaker 1: They're just a picture with a name and a list of powers, and you could shuffle them all up.

591
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,500
Speaker 1: You could replace them all with pictures of Superman.

592
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:20,110
Speaker 1: It wouldn't make any goddamn difference.

593
00:29:21,713 --> 00:29:22,829
Speaker 1: So, fuck this book.

594
00:29:23,712 --> 00:29:25,870
Speaker 0: I don't know what I can say beyond that.

595
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:29,630
Speaker 1: By far, I think it might be the worst of the whole thing.

596
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,548
Speaker 0: I could not tell you how many characters are in this.

597
00:29:32,172 --> 00:29:33,016
Speaker 1: I couldn't tell you any.

598
00:29:33,036 --> 00:29:36,150
Speaker 1: I can't even remember a single character from it at all.

599
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,596
Speaker 0: I remember the shape-shifting girl.

600
00:29:37,918 --> 00:29:39,344
Speaker 0: For whatever reason, I remember her, and...

601
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,304
Speaker 1: Maybe everyone was just her.

602
00:29:42,344 --> 00:29:43,030
Speaker 1: That's why they're all the same.

603
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:44,349
Speaker 0: And there was a girl with wings.

604
00:29:45,131 --> 00:29:45,272
Speaker 1: Okay.

605
00:29:45,676 --> 00:29:47,010
Speaker 1: I'd have to look at it to remember anything.

606
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:48,298
Speaker 0: The rest of them, I didn't.

607
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:49,526
Speaker 0: Oh, there's a bug-looking guy.

608
00:29:49,546 --> 00:29:50,130
Speaker 0: I forgot about him.

609
00:29:50,452 --> 00:29:50,729
Speaker 1: Okay.

610
00:29:51,111 --> 00:29:52,830
Speaker 0: He says a bunch of random stuff.

611
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,092
Speaker 1: Sure.

612
00:29:54,213 --> 00:29:56,109
Speaker 1: And the art was bad on top of that.

613
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:59,389
Speaker 0: It was just really generic-y, comic-book-y, boring art.

614
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:03,150
Speaker 1: At least some of the other bad books had the good art, like the Batwoman.

615
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,257
Speaker 1: This one, just bad.

616
00:30:04,257 --> 00:30:04,661
Speaker 1: 100% bad.

617
00:30:06,251 --> 00:30:07,139
Speaker 1: Fire all these people.

618
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,068
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, guys.

619
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:13,670
Speaker 0: I want to know if there's anyone in the world who likes this comic, and if so, I really want to know what they like about it.

620
00:30:13,971 --> 00:30:16,370
Speaker 1: I did see some people who liked it a lot.

621
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:20,608
Speaker 1: They must be the biggest Legion fanboys in the goddamn universe or something.

622
00:30:20,648 --> 00:30:21,009
Speaker 1: I don't know.

623
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:24,890
Speaker 1: Or maybe that's what they like, is they like non-char--?

624
00:30:25,131 --> 00:30:29,270
Speaker 1: I read the incredibly famous Christ in Infinite Earths, right?

625
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:33,089
Speaker 1: So I bought it and read it, just because it's so famous and important in comic history and everything, right?

626
00:30:33,651 --> 00:30:39,530
Speaker 1: And it has every DC comic superhero from the late '80s in it, or whatever, as all of them.

627
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:43,270
Speaker 1: But the thing is, on most of them aren't actually characters.

628
00:30:43,371 --> 00:30:48,790
Speaker 1: They're like this, where they appear on the page, and maybe they say something, but there's no character to them.

629
00:30:50,356 --> 00:30:52,525
Speaker 1: It's like, "I'm going to do a story about the Rocketeer,".

630
00:30:52,545 --> 00:30:53,710
Speaker 1: and I drew a picture of the Rocketeer.

631
00:30:54,172 --> 00:30:55,199
Speaker 1: And that's it.

632
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,105
Speaker 1: He's on the page.

633
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:56,487
Speaker 1: Look at him.

634
00:30:56,507 --> 00:30:56,930
Speaker 1: It's the Rocketeer.

635
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:57,893
Speaker 1: It's like, "Oh, it's just a picture of the

636
00:30:57,934 --> 00:30:58,637
Speaker 1: Rocketeer.".

637
00:30:58,878 --> 00:31:11,930
Speaker 1: He's not acting like the Rocketeer X. It's like, I could make a Back to the Future comic, and I could draw the Professor and Marty there, but if they don't act like the Professor and Marty, just like, "Hey, hey, let's go travel in time.

638
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,502
Speaker 1: Okay, we've traveled in time.

639
00:31:13,542 --> 00:31:14,148
Speaker 1: There is danger

640
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:14,329
Speaker 1: here.".

641
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:20,469
Speaker 1: It's like, if they're not acting like, "Oh my God, Marty, what are we going to--" then it's not actually them.

642
00:31:21,071 --> 00:31:23,310
Speaker 0: That was actually a pretty good Professor voice.

643
00:31:23,372 --> 00:31:23,909
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know, right?

644
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:24,736
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was good.

645
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,430
Speaker 0: So yeah, I'm giving this one a good.

646
00:31:28,032 --> 00:31:29,550
Speaker 0: Just to fuck up your rating system.

647
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,810
Speaker 1: You actually want me to put good for Legion Lost next to your name?

648
00:31:31,972 --> 00:31:32,125
Speaker 1: Nah.

649
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:32,688
Speaker 1: Okay.

650
00:31:33,236 --> 00:31:33,930
Speaker 0: I couldn't consciously.

651
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:38,438
Speaker 1: All right, Grifter, which I don't really remember, but-- It was really boring.

652
00:31:38,538 --> 00:31:41,170
Speaker 0: The art was okay, but it was so boring, I don't care.

653
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,175
Speaker 1: All right, so here's my notes.

654
00:31:42,497 --> 00:31:44,308
Speaker 1: "Find you with a creepy mask on.

655
00:31:44,429 --> 00:31:44,610
Speaker 1: Easy.".

656
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:47,828
Speaker 1: I think this guy was-- all right, he was trying to hide, but someone was trying to hide himself.

657
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:55,970
Speaker 0: All right, so he's a grifter, and he does this really generic, like, grift that wouldn't work on anyone.

658
00:31:56,531 --> 00:31:57,253
Speaker 1: You know what?

659
00:31:57,594 --> 00:32:02,128
Speaker 1: I don't even remember there being a grift, which shows just how bad this was.

660
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,119
Speaker 0: And then he gets kidnapped by aliens.

661
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,750
Speaker 0: They try to put an alien in his body.

662
00:32:06,213 --> 00:32:07,830
Speaker 0: He wakes up during it and runs away.

663
00:32:08,351 --> 00:32:10,625
Speaker 0: Now they can sense him, and he hears their voices.

664
00:32:10,666 --> 00:32:11,350
Speaker 0: They live style.

665
00:32:12,251 --> 00:32:14,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was-- I wrote, "They live," with an exclamation point.

666
00:32:15,071 --> 00:32:18,026
Speaker 0: So he's sitting there, and a random person will turn to him and be like, "Find you.

667
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:18,569
Speaker 0: Find

668
00:32:18,589 --> 00:32:18,690
Speaker 0: you.".

669
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:19,641
Speaker 0: And he's like, "Shut the fuck up.

670
00:32:19,661 --> 00:32:20,288
Speaker 0: Get away from me, you

671
00:32:20,308 --> 00:32:20,470
Speaker 0: bastards.".

672
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,476
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember that part.

673
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,990
Speaker 1: I also wrote down that the art was great.

674
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,495
Speaker 1: I'd have to see it again to remember that, but-- It was cool.

675
00:32:26,535 --> 00:32:28,090
Speaker 0: It was kind of gangly, the characters.

676
00:32:28,972 --> 00:32:33,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's like-- the fact that I remember nothing from this book at all.

677
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:37,590
Speaker 1: Like, at least Legion Lost was so bad that I remembered how bad it was.

678
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:41,950
Speaker 1: Grifter was just so nothing that I'm having a hard time remembering anything about it.

679
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:45,290
Speaker 1: I couldn't even remember what the character looked like until I looked it up on Google Image Search.

680
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:47,629
Speaker 1: And Rym left the book at work, so I can't look at it now.

681
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:50,210
Speaker 0: It just didn't give me a compelling reason to care about his narrative.

682
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,757
Speaker 0: I don't care what the aliens want.

683
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,490
Speaker 0: It wasn't really-- none of that was presented.

684
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:57,408
Speaker 0: Now, I think what they were going for is a, "You don't know what they

685
00:32:57,468 --> 00:32:57,649
Speaker 0: want.".

686
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:00,370
Speaker 0: That's why it's so horrifying, but-- Yup.

687
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:05,590
Speaker 0: Also, he jumped out of the plane before it took off, and that action scene just didn't really make any sense.

688
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:13,290
Speaker 0: The side character dialogue was dumb, and I'm going to say bad just because it was really boring.

689
00:33:15,591 --> 00:33:16,099
Speaker 1: Mr.

690
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:16,830
Speaker 1: Terrific.

691
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,098
Speaker 0: Might as well be Static Shock.

692
00:33:19,138 --> 00:33:22,150
Speaker 0: It was the same "I'm smart, look at my science" bullshit.

693
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:25,710
Speaker 1: But he's the third smartest guy in the universe or whatever, right?

694
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,794
Speaker 0: As he keeps telling me.

695
00:33:27,336 --> 00:33:28,299
Speaker 0: And I don't care.

696
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,110
Speaker 0: He's got these three balls, and he throws them around.

697
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:36,590
Speaker 0: He tricks the guy that's chasing him to go to a metal thing, just like in Static Shock.

698
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:40,422
Speaker 1: And it's like he's got these magic balls.

699
00:33:40,482 --> 00:33:42,670
Speaker 1: All his powers reside in these magic balls.

700
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,075
Speaker 1: Magic balls are him.

701
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:46,220
Speaker 1: Magic balls.

702
00:33:46,261 --> 00:33:48,350
Speaker 1: The third smartest guy in the world has magic balls.

703
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,190
Speaker 0: Wouldn't you if you were the third smartest guy in the world?

704
00:33:50,311 --> 00:33:51,688
Speaker 1: I would have a lot more magic balls.

705
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:52,507
Speaker 0: More than three?

706
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:52,916
Speaker 0: Yeah.

707
00:33:53,910 --> 00:34:02,073
Speaker 0: So he tricks the bad guy into going by the big metal thing, and then-- And the guy's like, "What?

708
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:03,417
Speaker 0: You magnetized

709
00:34:03,498 --> 00:34:03,738
Speaker 0: me?".

710
00:34:03,758 --> 00:34:06,046
Speaker 0: And the guy's like, "Yeah, I did.

711
00:34:06,066 --> 00:34:06,587
Speaker 0: I guess you know

712
00:34:06,688 --> 00:34:07,350
Speaker 0: science.".

713
00:34:07,511 --> 00:34:08,074
Speaker 0: Like, no.

714
00:34:08,822 --> 00:34:09,770
Speaker 0: None of you know science.

715
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,455
Speaker 1: No, not even the third smartest.

716
00:34:11,475 --> 00:34:14,949
Speaker 1: If that's the third smartest guy in the universe, that explains a fucking lot.

717
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:20,130
Speaker 0: But it was the same "I science you, you little guy" with my Baphidad crap that I hate.

718
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,940
Speaker 1: Also, what's the origin story?

719
00:34:23,121 --> 00:34:25,409
Speaker 1: I thought we were getting away from the origin stories in all these other books.

720
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,422
Speaker 1: But here we go, talking about the origin of Mr.

721
00:34:27,443 --> 00:34:27,705
Speaker 1: Terrific.

722
00:34:27,725 --> 00:34:28,268
Speaker 1: It's like, what the fuck?

723
00:34:28,851 --> 00:34:30,510
Speaker 0: But it was a boring origin.

724
00:34:30,876 --> 00:34:31,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, who gives a shit?

725
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:32,670
Speaker 0: And he's a boring character.

726
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:38,230
Speaker 1: I think the idea of making a book about a really smart--just a guy who's really smart could work out.

727
00:34:38,712 --> 00:34:39,417
Speaker 0: They did, Scott.

728
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:41,309
Speaker 0: He became the mayor of New York.

729
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:42,250
Speaker 1: Sure.

730
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,579
Speaker 1: But I'm talking about also in Fantastic Four, right?

731
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,085
Speaker 1: Fantastic Four often is good.

732
00:34:48,146 --> 00:34:49,510
Speaker 1: Not always, but often is good.

733
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:49,992
Speaker 1: Because Mr.

734
00:34:50,032 --> 00:34:53,206
Speaker 1: Fantastic is really smart, and they do stories about how smart Mr.

735
00:34:53,246 --> 00:34:53,889
Speaker 1: Fantastic is.

736
00:34:54,190 --> 00:35:00,310
Speaker 1: And how his smartness and his diligence at working so hard pulls him away from his family and all that kind of, you know.

737
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:00,841
Speaker 0: Yup, yup.

738
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:06,990
Speaker 1: And he solves problems with actual clever things as opposed to just making a Baphidad, although he often makes a Baphidad.

739
00:35:09,031 --> 00:35:09,874
Speaker 1: But yeah, this Mr.

740
00:35:09,914 --> 00:35:14,509
Speaker 1: Terrific is nowhere--even the worst Fantastic Four story is ten times better than Mr.

741
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:14,730
Speaker 0: Terrific.

742
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:19,890
Speaker 0: It was all Baphidad, and I was really annoyed by the dialogue of the bystanders, even more so than in Grifter.

743
00:35:20,512 --> 00:35:23,825
Speaker 0: Because there's a scene where he's up there, and the crowd's like, "Who's that?

744
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:24,508
Speaker 0: Nice

745
00:35:24,809 --> 00:35:24,950
Speaker 0: ass!".

746
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:30,010
Speaker 0: Like, they're checking out his ass, and just the things they're saying don't make sense.

747
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,490
Speaker 0: No one would say things like what they were saying.

748
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:33,370
Speaker 1: Nope.

749
00:35:33,813 --> 00:35:36,670
Speaker 1: No one would say anything like any of these characters in any of these books would say.

750
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:41,484
Speaker 0: Nah, Batman would say what Batman said in Batman #1.

751
00:35:41,484 --> 00:35:44,230
Speaker 0: Well, actually, Detective Comics #1.

752
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,510
Speaker 0: Batman would say what Batman said in that comic.

753
00:35:47,315 --> 00:35:48,442
Speaker 1: Anyway, so Mr.

754
00:35:48,462 --> 00:35:49,690
Speaker 1: Terrific, what are you giving--I say bad.

755
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:50,265
Speaker 1: It's a meh.

756
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,064
Speaker 1: Are you giving meh?

757
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:56,210
Speaker 0: 'Cause it was not--it wasn't actively as bad as a lot of this other stuff.

758
00:35:56,270 --> 00:36:02,530
Speaker 1: I think also I read all these week twos in a row, and I think my mood might have affected my string of bads here, but yeah, bad bad bad.

759
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:03,527
Speaker 0: I read 'em in two strings.

760
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:06,365
Speaker 1: I can't change my mind without re-reading it, but I'm gonna say bad.

761
00:36:07,671 --> 00:36:12,250
Speaker 0: So, Resurrection Man seems like a really cool concept that they're running into the ground.

762
00:36:13,172 --> 00:36:16,030
Speaker 1: You actually think the concept is cool if a guy who doesn't die and keeps coming back?

763
00:36:16,371 --> 00:36:17,375
Speaker 0: I think it could be cool.

764
00:36:17,516 --> 00:36:21,670
Speaker 0: as--take the Highlander concept, which people really dig, and-- I don't dig it that much.

765
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:27,410
Speaker 0: But you actually kill the guy, and he just wakes up, you know, Shadowrun the SNES game style a couple of days later.

766
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:36,450
Speaker 0: But no, every time he wakes up, he has some super power, and again, the plot was kind of boring and incomprehensible.

767
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:40,061
Speaker 1: Okay, so first of all, the art in this was horrendously awful.

768
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:41,426
Speaker 1: I showed you the rib boob.

769
00:36:42,671 --> 00:36:45,689
Speaker 0: I guess I didn't notice that, 'cause I was trying to figure out what was going on.

770
00:36:46,011 --> 00:36:55,569
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's like, some of the art in this is just hideous and inconsistent and doesn't stay on model, really, and I can't tell who's who a lot, and it's just like, what the fuck?

771
00:36:57,070 --> 00:37:00,164
Speaker 1: Yet again, there's another comic with an airplane involved.

772
00:37:00,265 --> 00:37:01,330
Speaker 1: How many of those are there?

773
00:37:01,792 --> 00:37:03,209
Speaker 1: All of them, I guess?

774
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:07,768
Speaker 1: The art style also seems to change from page to page a lot.

775
00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:10,550
Speaker 1: I don't know, it's just all over the place.

776
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:13,490
Speaker 0: I also like the story of maybe, you know, Final Destination style.

777
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,830
Speaker 0: You know, they're trying to kill him dead, 'cause he's supposed to be dead.

778
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:21,830
Speaker 0: But it's like they took that story, and they put superhero crap into it.

779
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:27,070
Speaker 1: The thing is, what's disappointing about this is this is written by Abnett and Lanning.

780
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:35,070
Speaker 1: Now, Abnett and Lanning actually wrote a whole bunch of Marvel comics, all the more recent cosmic outer space Marvel comics that I actually like a lot.

781
00:37:36,152 --> 00:37:37,719
Speaker 1: They went downhill over time.

782
00:37:37,759 --> 00:37:39,688
Speaker 1: They started off good, and they went down to meh.

783
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,114
Speaker 1: But I actually liked them.

784
00:37:41,535 --> 00:37:45,530
Speaker 1: But this Abnett and Lanning book is not good.

785
00:37:46,371 --> 00:37:47,699
Speaker 1: So, there you go.

786
00:37:48,041 --> 00:37:49,430
Speaker 1: Just 'cause, you know, no one's perfect.

787
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:50,998
Speaker 1: Jeff Lemire wrote a bad book.

788
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:52,750
Speaker 1: Abnett and Lanning wrote a bad book.

789
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:58,850
Speaker 0: It just, I don't know, it feels like one of those pulp comics from a long time ago, and they're trying to recapture that, I think.

790
00:37:59,211 --> 00:38:01,069
Speaker 1: I like pulp comics from a long time ago.

791
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,787
Speaker 0: But it's just, it's a little too...

792
00:38:04,495 --> 00:38:05,549
Speaker 1: Like a nice Flash Gordon?

793
00:38:06,474 --> 00:38:15,370
Speaker 0: I just feel like the storytelling in this general sense, it's kind of hard to explain, but it feels like a lot, like Demon Knights had the same problem.

794
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:21,669
Speaker 0: Like, it feels like this kind of, the DC crap just edges its way back in, even if the story would have otherwise been good.

795
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:30,048
Speaker 0: Like, they do this certain kind of portrayal of the story that just reminds me, "Oh yeah, I'm reading a superhero comic book that's actually kind of

796
00:38:30,068 --> 00:38:30,510
Speaker 0: generic.".

797
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:34,930
Speaker 1: Well, I think what these people, I get the feeling that a lot of these books like this, right?

798
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:50,990
Speaker 1: The books that aren't necessarily superhero books directly, but are still DC Universe, they're looking at Sandman, and they're looking at Alan Moore's Swamp Thing, and how those books were able to be sort of, you know, dark and sort of mystic and magical.

799
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:51,613
Speaker 0: You're right!

800
00:38:51,714 --> 00:38:54,970
Speaker 0: I hereby dub this a wannabe of that kind of comic.

801
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:56,074
Speaker 1: Right?

802
00:38:56,195 --> 00:39:08,050
Speaker 1: All these books like that are looking at those two examples that had a little bit of superhero world, they're in the DC Universe, but they managed to keep most of it out, but a little bit in, and it totally worked.

803
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:23,010
Speaker 1: And they're looking at those books and trying to be that and totally failing because Abnett and Lanning, as much as I liked some of their previous works, are not Neil Gaiman, and they're not Alan Moore, nor can they be.

804
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:29,854
Speaker 1: They should stick to being Abnett and Lanning, which is, you know, if they had stuck to being Abnett and Lanning and done, say, "You know what?

805
00:39:30,336 --> 00:39:41,126
Speaker 1: Actually, I like their outer space stuff in Marvel so much, maybe you should have had the Geoff Johns do the Resurrection Man, and had the Abnett and Lanning do the Green Lantern, maybe it could have been the first goddamn good Green

806
00:39:41,146 --> 00:39:41,448
Speaker 1: Lantern.".

807
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:49,870
Speaker 0: I would have rather seen Jeff Lemire do the Resurrection Man, because they need to focus on the guy being sad and alone because he keeps on dying.

808
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:52,147
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that could have worked out.

809
00:39:52,308 --> 00:39:52,550
Speaker 1: Anyway.

810
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:55,021
Speaker 1: So, for Resurrection Man, what do you have?

811
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:07,290
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go with Med, just because in Week 2, some of the stuff was so bad that I'd feel really awkward putting Resurrection Man in the same category as Legion Lost.

812
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:15,130
Speaker 1: I know, just because that's why you need a 5-star system is the best, because in a 5-star system, you'd give it a 2, and you'd give the Legion Lost the 1.

813
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:23,989
Speaker 0: I'll say Med, because I would read one more of this to see if it goes anywhere or gets interesting, but I would not read any more of Legion Lost if you paid me to.

814
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:24,836
Speaker 1: That's true.

815
00:40:25,446 --> 00:40:25,690
Speaker 1: Okay.

816
00:40:25,935 --> 00:40:26,610
Speaker 0: Suicide Squad.

817
00:40:27,051 --> 00:40:27,488
Speaker 1: Suicide Squad.

818
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:30,190
Speaker 0: I didn't know that was Harley Quinn until they said her name.

819
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,336
Speaker 1: Same thing, exactly.

820
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:38,208
Speaker 1: I did not know at all, because the character design was changed, and she wasn't acting like Harley Quinn at all.

821
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:38,691
Speaker 0: Not at all.

822
00:40:38,892 --> 00:40:48,510
Speaker 0: I liked her hammer, and some of the flashback-y stuff was more like her, but the her in the present of this comic was just boobs with a hammer.

823
00:40:49,797 --> 00:40:49,886
Speaker 1: Yeah.

824
00:40:50,392 --> 00:40:53,990
Speaker 0: And the story is kind of… cliche?

825
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:54,969
Speaker 0: Yeah.

826
00:40:55,230 --> 00:41:05,830
Speaker 0: We've got a Suicide Squad of criminals that we've put explosion collars on, only in this case we injected them so we wouldn't have to draw an explosion collar, and we send them to do suicide missions that they'll always survive.

827
00:41:06,613 --> 00:41:06,870
Speaker 1: Okay.

828
00:41:06,891 --> 00:41:07,529
Speaker 0: It's hardcore.

829
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:12,050
Speaker 1: So first of all, right, King Shark is fucking awesome.

830
00:41:12,171 --> 00:41:12,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, King Shark.

831
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:14,649
Speaker 1: Just because he's a fucking shark.

832
00:41:14,911 --> 00:41:16,196
Speaker 1: King Shark is….

833
00:41:16,216 --> 00:41:19,730
Speaker 0: I also like the dynamic.

834
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,670
Speaker 0: The characters, to be fair, are actually characters in this.

835
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:23,110
Speaker 1: That is true.

836
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:24,090
Speaker 0: They have personalities.

837
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:25,930
Speaker 0: King Shark is basically….

838
00:41:26,011 --> 00:41:28,250
Speaker 1: I wish they would have gone more all out with that.

839
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:28,900
Speaker 1: It would have been better.

840
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,698
Speaker 0: King Shark is like Dr.

841
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,270
Speaker 0: McNinja crossed with Radiscoll.

842
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:32,706
Speaker 0: Yeah.

843
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:40,810
Speaker 1: Actually, I kind of liked where this was going up until the reveal that they were all Battle Royaleed or whatever.

844
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:40,934
Speaker 1: Right?

845
00:41:42,014 --> 00:41:43,350
Speaker 1: It was like, "Oh, this is getting good.

846
00:41:43,894 --> 00:41:45,049
Speaker 1: Oh, that's what it is.

847
00:41:45,716 --> 00:41:46,324
Speaker 1: Ah, dang

848
00:41:46,344 --> 00:41:46,405
Speaker 1: it.".

849
00:41:46,792 --> 00:41:47,069
Speaker 1: You know?

850
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:51,710
Speaker 1: It's like they were going in a good direction, but then it wasn't actually.

851
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,989
Speaker 1: The reality was better than the lie.

852
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:57,930
Speaker 0: I'd rather them have a more complex hook to be there.

853
00:41:58,111 --> 00:41:59,170
Speaker 0: They're not forced to be there.

854
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:01,210
Speaker 0: There's no just, "Oh, the explosion collar.

855
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:01,781
Speaker 0: You gotta do

856
00:42:01,822 --> 00:42:01,985
Speaker 0: this.".

857
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:02,498
Speaker 0: But more….

858
00:42:03,171 --> 00:42:07,208
Speaker 1: I would have rather had just be like, "Let's fucking make mischief,

859
00:42:07,248 --> 00:42:07,670
Speaker 1: bitches.".

860
00:42:08,121 --> 00:42:08,450
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

861
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:11,850
Speaker 1: And have them sort of be all out, sort of kooky, making mischief, fucking shit up.

862
00:42:12,031 --> 00:42:12,428
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

863
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,109
Speaker 0: I would read that.

864
00:42:13,411 --> 00:42:13,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, right?

865
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,850
Speaker 0: Harley Quinn goes around just being Harley Quinn.

866
00:42:16,336 --> 00:42:16,530
Speaker 1: Right.

867
00:42:16,953 --> 00:42:18,810
Speaker 1: With fucking King Shark and these other dudes.

868
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:18,914
Speaker 1: Yeah.

869
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:29,170
Speaker 1: If you just let them loose instead of reining them in to be yet another forced together acronym team to go fight against the other organization.

870
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:34,030
Speaker 1: If you would have just let them loose, but kept them together because they were all going….

871
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:36,630
Speaker 1: Maybe they were all getting revenge on the same person or something.

872
00:42:37,058 --> 00:42:37,650
Speaker 1: You know, maybe….

873
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:39,130
Speaker 1: You know what you could have done?

874
00:42:39,753 --> 00:42:41,310
Speaker 1: One page, you're all trapped.

875
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:42,230
Speaker 1: You're all going to work for me.

876
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:46,590
Speaker 1: Next page, we totally just smashed your stupid system on fucking King Shark.

877
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:49,650
Speaker 1: And then them getting their revenge on… Oh, fuck yeah.

878
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:50,109
Speaker 1: Let them loose.

879
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:54,149
Speaker 1: So, there was potential there, which actually I put meh.

880
00:42:54,691 --> 00:42:58,810
Speaker 0: I also put meh because I liked the characters enough to where I wouldn't….

881
00:42:58,830 --> 00:42:59,330
Speaker 1: You had another….

882
00:42:59,330 --> 00:42:59,419
Speaker 1: Yeah.

883
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:06,669
Speaker 0: I think you encapsulated my thoughts, too, that I don't feel like the characters are going to be given enough room to thrive to where I'll care.

884
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:07,330
Speaker 1: Yup.

885
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:09,310
Speaker 1: Also, fucking King Shark.

886
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:10,750
Speaker 0: King Shark is the best.

887
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,867
Speaker 0: When he just fucking bites that guy's arm like….

888
00:43:13,512 --> 00:43:15,509
Speaker 1: They should have just made fucking King Shark the book.

889
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,130
Speaker 1: Ten to twenty-two pages of biting.

890
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:20,210
Speaker 1: That would have been great.

891
00:43:20,471 --> 00:43:20,888
Speaker 1: Best book.

892
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:23,670
Speaker 0: King Shark and Radiscoll, an epic adventure.

893
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:26,910
Speaker 1: Okay, so Superboy, the last book of this week.

894
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:30,310
Speaker 1: So, a lot of people… Is this Astro Boy or what?

895
00:43:30,932 --> 00:43:31,950
Speaker 0: It's Astro Boy.

896
00:43:32,595 --> 00:43:33,069
Speaker 0: Now, here's the thing.

897
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:36,146
Speaker 1: This is Astro Boy the same way the Lion King is.

898
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:40,150
Speaker 0: Many people hinted to me saying, "Oh, yeah, Rick's obviously going to like…".

899
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,549
Speaker 1: I mean, just look at this fucking page.

900
00:43:42,212 --> 00:43:43,650
Speaker 1: It's Astro Boy without the hair.

901
00:43:43,992 --> 00:43:44,102
Speaker 0: Yup.

902
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:45,088
Speaker 0: Come on.

903
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:47,550
Speaker 0: But I did like the….

904
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:48,470
Speaker 1: The art's actually really good.

905
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:48,788
Speaker 1: I like it.

906
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:56,209
Speaker 0: I did like the fact that the whole Smallville thing kind of gets explained that it was a virtual reality to figure this guy out.

907
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:59,090
Speaker 1: Well, because, yeah, this is going on, right?

908
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:02,690
Speaker 1: It's like this isn't a story of Superman's youth.

909
00:44:02,751 --> 00:44:04,850
Speaker 1: This is a story of someone who is not Superman.

910
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:07,590
Speaker 1: He's like a robot android something Astro Boy.

911
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:22,529
Speaker 1: But, they want him to be like Superman, so they need to give him similar memories or experiences to Superman, so he gets the virtual reality, you know, Smallville in sort of the Matrix style, which is sort of like, "Oh, that's pretty

912
00:44:22,549 --> 00:44:22,670
Speaker 1: cool.".

913
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:31,410
Speaker 1: But actually, I would have rather read that, you know, that Smallville comic than read the Astro Boy comic because I already read Astro Boy.

914
00:44:31,571 --> 00:44:31,691
Speaker 1: Now,

915
00:44:31,731 --> 00:44:32,194
Speaker 0: there's

916
00:44:32,214 --> 00:44:33,118
Speaker 1: kind of an aside,

917
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:39,706
Speaker 0: but I've noticed and I didn't point it out in all of them because I didn't, you know, I stopped noting it after I saw it so often, but

918
00:44:40,329 --> 00:44:40,590
Speaker 1: a lot

919
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:51,129
Speaker 0: of these comics are making very quick oblique references to fan culture or current events in ways that reek of trying to be pop-cultury edgy.

920
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:55,209
Speaker 0: Like in this one, the white haired girl is like, "I totally wasn't a Mary

921
00:44:55,249 --> 00:44:55,430
Speaker 0: Sue.".

922
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:56,194
Speaker 1: Yeah.

923
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:57,290
Speaker 0: It's like, "Yeah, really?

924
00:44:57,852 --> 00:45:00,023
Speaker 0: That didn't… That line kind of came out of

925
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:00,507
Speaker 0: nowhere.".

926
00:45:00,952 --> 00:45:02,530
Speaker 1: I do want to give some props to this book.

927
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:06,430
Speaker 1: This book was a very high meh, almost good because… Almost good.

928
00:45:06,813 --> 00:45:06,930
Speaker 1: Yeah.

929
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:12,310
Speaker 1: The props I want to give it are, number one, there was no fighting in it and there was only one explosion.

930
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:12,670
Speaker 1: Yep.

931
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:16,130
Speaker 1: Almost every other book has like an obligatory action scene.

932
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:18,250
Speaker 1: There was like five pages of superhero battling.

933
00:45:18,893 --> 00:45:19,869
Speaker 1: No battling in here.

934
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:21,410
Speaker 1: None whatsoever, right?

935
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:23,048
Speaker 1: There's one explosion and that's it.

936
00:45:25,279 --> 00:45:26,130
Speaker 1: Also, I wrote boots.

937
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,650
Speaker 1: Is someone wearing cool boots or something?

938
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:28,527
Speaker 0: There were some really good….

939
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:30,950
Speaker 0: Multiple people had really good footwear in the art.

940
00:45:31,111 --> 00:45:32,169
Speaker 0: I also had a note about that.

941
00:45:32,373 --> 00:45:32,606
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

942
00:45:33,012 --> 00:45:33,730
Speaker 1: I like that footwear.

943
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:36,770
Speaker 1: Also, proper nouns ahoy.

944
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:40,810
Speaker 1: Yet another acronym organization working on evil science or good science.

945
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:41,965
Speaker 0: But I did like how I….

946
00:45:42,471 --> 00:45:45,510
Speaker 0: The expected story of, you know, they're going to kill him.

947
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:46,508
Speaker 0: She sets him free.

948
00:45:47,571 --> 00:45:50,489
Speaker 0: It was building up to that in the beginning and then immediately that was not it.

949
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,850
Speaker 0: He, you know, when they try to kill him, she doesn't stop them.

950
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:53,628
Speaker 0: She's like, "Oh, well.

951
00:45:53,912 --> 00:45:54,197
Speaker 0: This is

952
00:45:54,237 --> 00:45:54,624
Speaker 0: sad."

953
00:45:55,151 --> 00:45:57,710
Speaker 0: And then when he blows up, all those people die.

954
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,010
Speaker 0: She doesn't let him free.

955
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,350
Speaker 0: She puts him back in the fucking lab.

956
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:02,849
Speaker 1: I actually kind of wish they would like….

957
00:46:03,131 --> 00:46:05,510
Speaker 1: It would be really cool if they took this book, right?

958
00:46:05,951 --> 00:46:08,130
Speaker 1: And you could even leave the Astro Boy story.

959
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:11,570
Speaker 1: But what you do is you make that girl the focus.

960
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:13,450
Speaker 1: Like everything is from her perspective.

961
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:17,650
Speaker 1: And like the Super Boy is like just sort of barely in it in the background.

962
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:18,830
Speaker 0: He's the force of nature.

963
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:22,890
Speaker 1: He's sort of like not even there, but it's all about this girl.

964
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:26,908
Speaker 1: Like you show her going home at night and the Super Boy is just sort of there-ish.

965
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:29,290
Speaker 1: You know, that would have been fucking awesome.

966
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:32,410
Speaker 0: Because then you could do a whole thing where his thoughts are really just her projecting.

967
00:46:32,531 --> 00:46:34,570
Speaker 1: And because the girl's actually pretty cool.

968
00:46:34,773 --> 00:46:34,864
Speaker 0: Yeah.

969
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:44,030
Speaker 0: But like her projecting on him and her having, you know, expecting all these reactions to situations or expecting all these sorts of things, but really it's just her projection.

970
00:46:44,213 --> 00:46:45,090
Speaker 0: She can't understand him.

971
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:46,087
Speaker 0: He's totally alien to her.

972
00:46:46,394 --> 00:46:46,885
Speaker 1: Yeah, and he's….

973
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:48,190
Speaker 0: But no, they didn't go in that direction.

974
00:46:48,471 --> 00:46:57,050
Speaker 0: And, you know, to go from you saying props, my biggest con with this, and it's funny because everyone told me that they thought I'd really like this one.

975
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:58,830
Speaker 0: And they're probably going to be surprised that I give it a met.

976
00:46:59,894 --> 00:47:01,590
Speaker 0: It wreaks a little too much of effort.

977
00:47:01,791 --> 00:47:05,170
Speaker 0: Like it's trying too hard to be poignant and serious.

978
00:47:05,592 --> 00:47:08,550
Speaker 0: And it's not doing it terribly elegantly.

979
00:47:08,893 --> 00:47:09,179
Speaker 0: Maybe.

980
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:09,750
Speaker 1: I like the arts.

981
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:10,668
Speaker 0: I like the arts too.

982
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:16,330
Speaker 0: It was a little too, you know, the monologues of Super Boy were a little too forced.

983
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:17,357
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

984
00:47:17,712 --> 00:47:18,368
Speaker 1: What am I?

985
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:19,328
Speaker 1: Who am I?

986
00:47:19,935 --> 00:47:20,770
Speaker 0: Oh, this is a simulation.

987
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:21,509
Speaker 0: What do you see?

988
00:47:22,453 --> 00:47:23,207
Speaker 1: What do you see?

989
00:47:24,012 --> 00:47:25,430
Speaker 0: But in this case, he's like, what do I see?

990
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:27,968
Speaker 0: I see this and this and this and this and this.

991
00:47:28,757 --> 00:47:28,989
Speaker 1: Yup.

992
00:47:29,731 --> 00:47:34,246
Speaker 0: So I'm going to have to give it a met just for that because it could have been so much better, but they didn't go….

993
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:35,990
Speaker 1: I also gave it a met, but it was almost good.

994
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:42,590
Speaker 0: It's funny to me how I've given one of these comics a met because it wasn't crazy enough.

995
00:47:43,372 --> 00:47:46,069
Speaker 0: And yet the ones that I hate the most are the craziest ones.

996
00:47:46,718 --> 00:47:47,226
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

997
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:52,130
Speaker 0: There's a certain kind of crazy, like there's over the top crazy, like if….

998
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:57,350
Speaker 1: I think what it is, is it's just about, it's not about that you like crazy or you like uncrazy.

999
00:47:57,590 --> 00:48:02,870
Speaker 1: It's like given this sort of raw material, what direction do you take it?

1000
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:09,970
Speaker 1: And it seems like they take the raw materials in the opposite direction of whatever direction they naturally want to go in to make a balance.

1001
00:48:10,312 --> 00:48:12,950
Speaker 1: Whereas what they should do is they should just take it to the extreme.

1002
00:48:13,131 --> 00:48:15,950
Speaker 1: If something wants to go crazy, let it be crazy.

1003
00:48:16,153 --> 00:48:17,150
Speaker 0: And then you get Legion Lost.

1004
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:19,368
Speaker 0: It wants to be what it is and it is what it is.

1005
00:48:20,573 --> 00:48:22,210
Speaker 1: At least it's for somebody.

1006
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:23,409
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have to give it that.

1007
00:48:23,811 --> 00:48:26,289
Speaker 1: In 52 comics, not all of them are going to be for everyone.

1008
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:32,230
Speaker 0: I mean if you really like incomprehensible bullshit, Legion Lost is probably one of the better comics you could read.

1009
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:33,343
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean there are 52 of them.

1010
00:48:35,351 --> 00:48:43,350
Speaker 1: There's no way they could possibly all be good nor would I expect them to be because that would mean they would all be catering to me, which is not a good idea.

1011
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:45,589
Speaker 1: You want to have some of them cater to different groups.

1012
00:48:46,293 --> 00:48:49,305
Speaker 1: So, you know, but I don't know.

1013
00:48:50,369 --> 00:48:50,610
Speaker 1: Whatever.

1014
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:53,269
Speaker 1: You still should let them go in the direction they naturally want to go.

1015
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:55,348
Speaker 0: I think that's pretty much it.

1016
00:48:55,831 --> 00:48:56,647
Speaker 1: That's it for week two.

1017
00:48:57,330 --> 00:49:02,840
Speaker 1: Next time on week three we got Batman, Catwoman, more Green Lanterns.

1018
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:04,389
Speaker 0: Oh my god, that Green Lantern shit.

1019
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:08,550
Speaker 1: More Legions of Superheroes and Wonder Woman with the cool cover.

1020
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:12,829
Speaker 0: I feel like week one is my favorite week.

1021
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:17,410
Speaker 0: Week four is my second favorite week because I kind of liked Aquaman.

1022
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:18,457
Speaker 1: Well, we'll see.

1023
00:49:19,003 --> 00:49:19,489
Speaker 1: We'll get there.

1024
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:23,370
Speaker 0: But seriously, Blue Beetle, that's the only one I didn't read yet from week three.

1025
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:25,903
Speaker 0: The fuck's the Blue Beetle's deal because I see him.

1026
00:49:26,065 --> 00:49:26,750
Speaker 0: He comes up a lot.

1027
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:31,065
Speaker 1: It's a guy who's got sort of this mechanical... It's like an outer space...

1028
00:49:31,411 --> 00:49:31,769
Speaker 0: So Iron Man.

1029
00:49:32,551 --> 00:49:38,789
Speaker 1: No, it's a magical scarab that came from outer space and you turn into Iron Man that way instead of being Iron Man because you're rich.

1030
00:49:40,813 --> 00:49:41,007
Speaker 0: Okay.

1031
00:49:43,052 --> 00:49:48,070
Speaker 1: Imagine if an alien artifact came in the window and you took it and it turned into cat armor.

1032
00:49:55,373 --> 00:49:57,510
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1033
00:49:57,730 --> 00:50:02,650
