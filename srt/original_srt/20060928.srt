00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:49,658

11
00:00:49,678 --> 00:00:56,684
Speaker 0: yeah I don't read it But the best way I found to follow boing boing is to wait for someone like Scott to link you to it Periodically.

12
00:00:56,725 --> 00:00:58,620
Speaker 1: now for everything on boing boing is gold.

13
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,471

Speaker 1: they interviewed my man Doug Rushkoff Who is basically a genius?

19
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:33,054

20
00:01:33,475 --> 00:01:36,525
Speaker 1: he writes comic books He teaches at NYU.

21

00:01:41,943 --> 00:01:46,180
Speaker 0: it is entirely heterosexual and based solely in logic and reason.

27
00:01:47,263 --> 00:01:50,952
Speaker 1: It's sort of like the way, you know It's like.

28
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:53,006
Speaker 1: yeah I wish I was not as that you have.

29
00:01:53,227 --> 00:02:00,796
Speaker 0: you have an intellectual hard-on for Douglas Rushkoff The same way that I have a creative hard-on for Neil Gaiman, I guess.

30
00:02:00,836 --> 00:02:02,783
Speaker 1: yeah something like that He also.

00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,922
Speaker 0: Mmm, I think that's why Daryl kept stealing their bits.

66
00:05:38,685 --> 00:05:39,729
Speaker 1: It might be it's you know.

67
00:05:40,292 --> 00:05:46,889

Speaker 0: Pokemon games whether you like it or not ushered in a new era of gaming.

89
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:23,467
Speaker 0: Well, I guess internal that in terms of gaming itself, but in terms of culture around gaming Specifically the portable gaming the culture, you know The culture of Pokemon kids has a lot to do with why certain kinds of games get made today.

90
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:24,430
Speaker 1: That is true.

91
00:07:24,932 --> 00:07:31,023
Speaker 1: Another thing is, you know Pokemon the TV show the anime crap, whatever Magga, awesome.

92
00:07:31,063 --> 00:07:38,150
Speaker 1: Well the original Pokemon adventures manga is actually really awesome with red and yellow.

93
00:07:38,431 --> 00:07:44,850
Speaker 1: Yes, the one and the original Pokemon games, you know the main line of Pokemon games.

97
00:08:01,891 --> 00:08:06,030
Speaker 0: I think that you missed my joke about mainline because it's like a drug all addictive.

98
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,357
Speaker 1: I don't know what you're talking about.

99
00:08:08,558 --> 00:08:09,280
Speaker 1: I don't get it.

100
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:10,887
Speaker 0: Pokemon is like mainlining.

101
00:08:10,947 --> 00:08:12,232
Speaker 0: It's the main line I don't know.

102
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:15,484
Speaker 0: main lining is a is slang for doing intravenous drugs.

103
00:08:15,725 --> 00:08:16,348
Speaker 1: I didn't know that.

104
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,559
Speaker 1: Wow So I chose you.

105
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:19,726
Speaker 1: how much of a druggie I am?

106
00:08:19,927 --> 00:08:20,913
Speaker 1: good game I didn't know.

107
00:08:20,954 --> 00:08:23,268
Speaker 1: a main lining is but now I know the more you know.

108
00:08:24,374 --> 00:08:24,957
Speaker 1: Yeah, I learned.

109
00:08:25,017 --> 00:08:27,609
Speaker 1: I learned basically everything about Pokemon over.

110
00:08:27,991 --> 00:08:33,269
Speaker 1: I read the Wikipedia and I realized I played Pokemon red and I played Pokemon silver.

111
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:41,640
Speaker 1: and since then the only Pokemon games to come out were like these Gem, whatever ones.

112
00:08:41,702 --> 00:08:47,690
Speaker 1: I don't forget what they're called But if I play that and then I get either diamond or pearl I'm all caught up.

113
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,192
Speaker 1: There's only.

114
00:08:48,273 --> 00:08:51,068
Speaker 1: I only really need to play two Pokemon games to catch up.

115
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:51,410
Speaker 0: now.

116
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:55,530
Speaker 0: I meanwhile have never played a Pokemon game ever not even in passing.

117
00:08:55,852 --> 00:08:58,124
Speaker 1: I'll lend you my a copy of Pokemon red.

118
00:08:58,164 --> 00:08:59,089
Speaker 1: You could play in your GBA.

119
00:08:59,732 --> 00:09:03,547
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't want to bust the GBA out with its lack of a backlight SP.

120
00:09:03,588 --> 00:09:04,190
Speaker 1: That's downstairs.

121
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:06,680
Speaker 0: Oh, you mean Pete's SP that he keeps leaving at our house.

122
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:07,765
Speaker 0: That is effectively ours.

123
00:09:07,986 --> 00:09:08,548
Speaker 1: Yep, that one.

124
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:13,487
Speaker 0: Okay Yeah, I'll put it right with Scott Johnson's DVD player you mean our DVD player.

125
00:09:13,568 --> 00:09:17,079
Speaker 0: that's right Yep, but no, I just I never played any Pokemon games.

126
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,390
Speaker 0: I didn't even realize there were Pokemon games back then.

127
00:09:20,571 --> 00:09:27,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's basically I mean, it's an RPG with leveling So it's kind of a but really the leveling doesn't matter at all.

128
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:40,784
Speaker 1: if you you know, if you use attacks at the right element, you know, it's all fun and games and You know, it's mostly exploring this map and talking to people and you know figuring out You know, how do I get through certain areas?

129
00:09:40,864 --> 00:09:41,629
Speaker 1: and you know?

130
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:46,470
Speaker 1: What trick do I have to do to get this Pokemon to come out of a tiding hole and all that kind of stuff?

131
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,442
Speaker 0: Don't forget trying to get the ultra rare uber whatever Pokemon.

132
00:09:50,743 --> 00:09:52,690
Speaker 1: No, that's not really necessary.

133
00:09:52,891 --> 00:10:10,282
Speaker 1: I mean I used to put the first time I played Pokemon I did catch them all and then in the second Pokemon the silver one There were 250 Pokemon instead of 150 and I caught you know, I brought my original 150 over But there was still you know, a hundred more to get.

134
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:15,744
Speaker 1: I didn't care about it that I just caught whatever I felt like and I used the Pokemon I cared about.

135
00:10:15,805 --> 00:10:18,998
Speaker 1: screw all those other Pokemon And I think that's really the way.

136
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:21,870
Speaker 1: if you want to have fun playing Pokemon if you try to catch them all.

137
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,234
Speaker 1: It's not really that fun cuz.

138
00:10:23,274 --> 00:10:24,738
Speaker 1: now and Pokemon diamond.

139
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:27,205
Speaker 1: They're like 500 some odd Pokemon.

140
00:10:27,265 --> 00:10:28,348
Speaker 0: You can't catch 500 Pokemon.

141
00:10:29,514 --> 00:10:30,624
Speaker 1: No, you can't catch 500 Pokemon.

142
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:33,253
Speaker 1: Snorlax.

143
00:10:33,334 --> 00:10:34,021
Speaker 0: Porlax.

144
00:10:34,062 --> 00:10:45,455
Speaker 1: Yeah, so So, you know really all you do is you figure out which Pokemon you like, you know You like the way they look you like the way they fight and you use those Treat them like your babies.

145
00:10:45,515 --> 00:10:47,963
Speaker 0: and then I only really know the original Pokemon.

146
00:10:48,104 --> 00:10:49,669
Speaker 0: and I only really like Squirtle.

147
00:10:50,732 --> 00:10:51,494
Speaker 1: I like Dragonite.

148
00:10:51,514 --> 00:10:53,400
Speaker 0: Squirtle and Bulbasaur are my men.

149
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:54,343
Speaker 1: Dragonite.

150
00:10:55,366 --> 00:10:56,470
Speaker 1: I like Dragonite and I like.

151
00:10:58,731 --> 00:10:59,653
Speaker 1: What's the other one I like?

152
00:10:59,854 --> 00:11:01,137
Speaker 1: oh the one that Adish.

153
00:11:01,538 --> 00:11:02,661
Speaker 1: I like Adish, uh-huh.

154
00:11:03,002 --> 00:11:04,065
Speaker 0: I kind of like Togepi.

155
00:11:04,948 --> 00:11:05,690
Speaker 1: I don't know what that is.

156
00:11:07,548 --> 00:11:09,213
Speaker 1: and What's the other one?

157
00:11:09,254 --> 00:11:10,298
Speaker 1: I forget which ones I like.

158
00:11:10,518 --> 00:11:10,800
Speaker 1: I like.

159
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,783
Speaker 1: I like a few Pokemon.

160
00:11:11,803 --> 00:11:13,470
Speaker 0: It's all about Squirtle and Bulbasaur.

161
00:11:14,076 --> 00:11:18,336
Speaker 1: Oh the guy with the swirly mouth Whatever his name is though a little known fact.

162
00:11:18,918 --> 00:11:30,830
Speaker 0: the voice actress who did the voices of many Pokemon including if I recall correctly Bulbasaur was none other in Japan than Mikumi Hayashibara One of the most highly paid voice actresses ever.

163
00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:37,250
Speaker 1: It seems like they give her a lot of parts doing like these little tiny noises for like one second in shows.

164
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:44,338
Speaker 0: I don't know if just because she liked doing it or if it was just a gimmick or whatever, but it's funny It is it's it's great.

165
00:11:44,378 --> 00:11:45,725
Speaker 1: I'd like if I interviewed her.

166
00:11:45,745 --> 00:11:46,550
Speaker 1: That's what I would ask her.

167
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:52,890
Speaker 1: It's the only question I really need to ask her is you know Why do you do these parts and shows doing like little animal voices, you know?

168
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,564
Speaker 1: Maybe she's just very good at it and everyone else sucks in Japan.

169
00:11:56,584 --> 00:11:56,885
Speaker 1: I don't know.

170
00:11:56,986 --> 00:11:57,830
Speaker 0: She is really good at it.

171
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,761
Speaker 0: I guess though she is, you know, one of the most sought-after voice.

172
00:12:00,781 --> 00:12:03,130
Speaker 0: that was I don't think she's been in any anime recently.

173
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,396
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think anyone.

174
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:07,329
Speaker 1: I think she's sort of like, you know washed up and retired.

175
00:12:07,349 --> 00:12:13,590
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, she was super big when we first got into anime and then it kind of shifted and then Ayumi was really big.

176
00:12:13,771 --> 00:12:14,976
Speaker 0: Well, I mean he's always been big.

177
00:12:15,036 --> 00:12:17,386
Speaker 1: Well, Mikumi wasn't exactly the same.

178
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:18,390
Speaker 1: She was a voice actor.

179
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,217
Speaker 1: Well, you me is a pop star.

180
00:12:20,237 --> 00:12:21,924
Speaker 1: Well, I'll be is like my god.

181
00:12:22,145 --> 00:12:27,310
Speaker 0: Mikumi was a pop star Not like Madonna level but gumi was one of the big pop stars.

182
00:12:28,132 --> 00:12:29,345
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah.

183
00:12:29,365 --> 00:12:34,910
Speaker 0: All right Now this was actually Scott's news and I stole it and pushed another news off because he really wanted to talk about it.

184
00:12:35,011 --> 00:12:37,789
Speaker 0: We didn't want to wait till Monday, and I don't know if you'll care or not.

185
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:43,007
Speaker 0: But the patents the final patents on the gift image, you know, gi.

186
00:12:43,148 --> 00:12:44,953
Speaker 1: Oh Jeff No, technically

187
00:12:45,294 --> 00:12:56,210
Speaker 0: no because according to several studies about 70% of people in the world say gift Correct and the vast majority of human beings in America say gift

188
00:12:56,390 --> 00:13:01,850
Speaker 1: Yes, but somehow on the official website the guy who made gift says it must be pronounced Jeff

189
00:13:02,251 --> 00:13:03,656
Speaker 0: Yeah, now everyone

190
00:13:03,736 --> 00:13:05,121
Speaker 1: denies him now.

191
00:13:05,281 --> 00:13:07,368
Speaker 0: One of the reasons is that Jeff sounds kind of dumb.

192
00:13:08,212 --> 00:13:10,080
Speaker 1: Yep, it's a name of a peanut butter brand.

193
00:13:10,221 --> 00:13:14,697
Speaker 0: Also the fact that it's an acronym for Graphics interchange format like that.

194
00:13:15,158 --> 00:13:17,484
Speaker 0: Uh, gah, it's a plosive G.

195
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:18,728
Speaker 1: It's not a graphics.

196
00:13:18,828 --> 00:13:21,042
Speaker 0: It's graphics Yeah, it's not giraffes.

197
00:13:21,163 --> 00:13:21,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.

198
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:28,890
Speaker 0: And of course last but not least the people responsible for gift are in many ways a lot like the GNU free people.

199
00:13:29,271 --> 00:13:37,248
Speaker 0: And in fact, I found a distinct correlation between people who say Jeff and people who are all GNU Yeah, so I guess we should start saying Jannu

200
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:40,762
Speaker 1: Yeah,

201
00:13:40,944 --> 00:13:47,449
Speaker 0: but anyway I'm sure many of you are actually too young to remember this story or just didn't care enough about the internet.

202
00:13:48,152 --> 00:13:50,883
Speaker 0: Gifts were a big deal in the early days of the internet.

203
00:13:50,903 --> 00:13:52,068
Speaker 1: They were a huge deal.

204
00:13:52,088 --> 00:14:00,988
Speaker 0: now It was done by CompuServe but this company called Unisys did a thing that was covered by a patent that had that gift also used.

205
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:10,350
Speaker 0: and then IBM and a bunch of other people also had patents and they all covered this thing that Pretty much everyone was using for free before all these companies started suing everybody.

206
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,829
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was an image file format named gift and everyone was using it.

207
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:19,389
Speaker 1: But a lot of the technology in that file format was patented by various other companies.

208
00:14:19,469 --> 00:14:22,890
Speaker 0: now Unisys was generally rat-bastardly about it.

209
00:14:22,951 --> 00:14:30,733
Speaker 0: But then you know They played nice a little while and then they started being really really really mean right before the year 2000.

210
00:14:30,733 --> 00:14:43,640
Speaker 0: And to make a long story short all the patents But one have expired and now at the beginning of October coming up real soon October 1st The last patent covering gift will expire.

211
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:50,626
Speaker 0: at that point gift and everything involved in gift are 100% free public domain to the world forever.

212
00:14:50,646 --> 00:14:52,832
Speaker 0: Hooray This is.

213
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:58,429
Speaker 0: it's such a rare thing that something like this happens in our day and age where something is actually for.

214
00:14:58,469 --> 00:15:00,339
Speaker 1: patents Don't last a thousand years.

215
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,070
Speaker 1: They last a reasonable amount of time.

216
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:12,646
Speaker 0: The thing is the patent for gift lasted almost be it through and beyond the useful life of gift Yeah, isn't useful anymore except for animated gifs on 4chan.

217
00:15:12,807 --> 00:15:25,312
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much You know, I mean it does still have its uses to make you know, very Light websites that you know can have a lot of bandwidth traffic because they are smaller than pings and JPEGs and anything else You're gonna use.

218
00:15:26,015 --> 00:15:30,150
Speaker 1: but at the same time you really if you use a ping it's not gonna hurt you that badly.

219
00:15:30,353 --> 00:15:32,615
Speaker 1: I mean, come on What are you worried about?

220
00:15:33,238 --> 00:15:34,986
Speaker 0: Well alpha which doesn't work so well.

221
00:15:35,207 --> 00:15:37,719
Speaker 1: a lot of things Yeah, but that's gonna be fixed soon.

222
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:50,262
Speaker 1: not that gif has alpha in it, yeah Yeah, that's that's the realm of JPEG and paying and whatnot, but Yeah, gift is free if does have alpha these transparent gifts.

223
00:15:50,844 --> 00:15:53,311
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but it's not the same kind of thing that you can do in Ping.

224
00:15:53,331 --> 00:15:58,246
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's only because you shrink the palette and gift but it's pretty old.

225
00:15:58,266 --> 00:15:59,550
Speaker 1: It is pretty old.

226
00:15:59,913 --> 00:16:02,473
Speaker 0: I mean the only real news here is that Gif is free.

227
00:16:02,493 --> 00:16:03,517
Speaker 0: It is absolutely free.

228
00:16:03,537 --> 00:16:12,870
Speaker 1: if you'd ever wondered what came of all that stuff because a lot of new people I think a lot of you didn't even know there was trouble concerning gift Like they just thought a gift was a different kind of file format.

229
00:16:13,346 --> 00:16:14,575
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean I guess it was because of.

230
00:16:14,816 --> 00:16:21,069
Speaker 0: we grew up in a very specific and important era of the Internet Where all these things happened and they were big deals.

231
00:16:22,031 --> 00:16:31,420
Speaker 0: I mean there were gift versus JPEG wars while we were making websites on geocities back in the day Yeah, and nowadays no one even knows it cares.

232
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,342
Speaker 0: people use whatever.

233
00:16:32,543 --> 00:16:35,250
Speaker 1: yeah, so but those days are finally over.

234
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,481
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's no more trouble with using gift.

235
00:16:38,943 --> 00:16:41,717
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you will now see there There's a lot of software out there.

236
00:16:41,737 --> 00:16:52,153
Speaker 1: a lot of people like wouldn't use gift, you know For one reason or another for the patent thing, but now everyone's gonna use it without any qualms and it should make life a little Bit easier.

237
00:16:52,214 --> 00:16:52,355
Speaker 0: Yep.

238
00:16:52,536 --> 00:16:54,450
Speaker 0: In fact, there are a whole bunch of open source programs.

239
00:16:54,570 --> 00:17:00,985
Speaker 0: I think go script is one of them where they were actually waiting and starting October 1st They're going to release versions that support gift.

240
00:17:01,226 --> 00:17:03,579
Speaker 0: Yeah They waited this long.

241
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:14,640
Speaker 0: Yeah Wow Wow things of the day.

242
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:22,140
Speaker 0: Which day today today today not do I don't know where you're going with this?

243
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,430
Speaker 0: But I don't see a funny joke coming anywhere three day.

244
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,720
Speaker 0: There is no joke on the horizon here at all for day.

245
00:17:29,821 --> 00:17:31,046
Speaker 0: You're just gonna keep going with this.

246
00:17:31,487 --> 00:17:33,595
Speaker 0: I'll just turn off your microphone one day.

247
00:17:33,615 --> 00:17:37,629
Speaker 1: All right My thing of the day you may not know this.

248
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:41,260
Speaker 1: In fact, I didn't really know this but there were airships.

249
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:43,667
Speaker 1: Yeah, there were lots of them.

250
00:17:44,109 --> 00:17:51,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I knew that we had zeppelins But I didn't know we had airships like real airships dirigibles if you will.

251
00:17:51,741 --> 00:17:54,430
Speaker 0: Oh, do you ever see Indiana Jones the Last Crusade?

252
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,899
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was like a blimp, but they didn't.

253
00:17:58,102 --> 00:18:00,331
Speaker 1: It didn't what didn't have airplanes on it.

254
00:18:00,693 --> 00:18:02,078
Speaker 0: It had one airplane on it one.

255
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,086
Speaker 1: It didn't have a whole bunch of them on it.

256
00:18:04,528 --> 00:18:07,519
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I believe you're thinking today's the USS Macon.

257
00:18:07,981 --> 00:18:10,149
Speaker 1: Yes, see in 1935.

258
00:18:10,149 --> 00:18:12,136
Speaker 1: There was this USS Macon.

259
00:18:12,296 --> 00:18:16,645
Speaker 1: It was an airship 785 foot airship.

260
00:18:16,966 --> 00:18:18,270
Speaker 0: now think about that for a minute.

261
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,817
Speaker 0: that is almost last exile in proportion.

262
00:18:20,857 --> 00:18:21,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a picture of it.

263
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:28,240
Speaker 1: you can go look at it and It had a hangar bay with four sparrowhawk biplanes.

264
00:18:28,862 --> 00:18:33,719
Speaker 1: You know, this is a big airship with planes in it and it fell into the sea.

265
00:18:34,942 --> 00:18:46,900
Speaker 0: See, I've always been a huge fan of airships and air pirates, but more importantly in the modern world I'm a huge fan of a lot of people who've been trying to bring back airships for intercontinental shipping.

266
00:18:47,442 --> 00:18:47,864
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're.

267
00:18:47,964 --> 00:18:52,180
Speaker 1: I mean you could pick up a warehouse with one of these things and fly it over the ocean real cheaply.

268
00:18:52,521 --> 00:18:59,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean imagine instead of sending, you know load stuff onto a boat send the boat over load the stuff out of trucks Send it over to the warehouse.

269
00:18:59,622 --> 00:19:02,280
Speaker 0: You could just pick up the warehouse full of stuff from the factory.

270
00:19:02,721 --> 00:19:07,297
Speaker 0: Take it to wherever your distribution center was put it down pick up another warehouse and take it back.

271
00:19:07,577 --> 00:19:10,384
Speaker 0: Yep Unfortunately, pretty cool.

272
00:19:10,785 --> 00:19:18,736
Speaker 0: The primary argument I've seen against using airships in the modern world is nothing other than What if terrorists shoot it down?

273
00:19:18,756 --> 00:19:18,816
Speaker 0: OMG?

274
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,692
Speaker 1: Uh They're not easy to shoot down.

275
00:19:22,712 --> 00:19:23,458
Speaker 0: Yeah, they are.

276
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,165
Speaker 0: Yeah, they are.

277
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:25,667
Speaker 1: shoot it with.

278
00:19:25,727 --> 00:19:26,872
Speaker 1: you couldn't shoot it with like a guy.

279
00:19:26,893 --> 00:19:28,540
Speaker 1: you shoot it with like a rocket or something.

280
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,141
Speaker 0: They're.

281
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:30,329
Speaker 0: they're big and slow.

282
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,899
Speaker 0: It wouldn't be hard to shoot one down.

283
00:19:32,322 --> 00:19:33,268
Speaker 1: Yeah, you just you couldn't.

284
00:19:33,328 --> 00:19:35,079
Speaker 1: you know, if you shot it with a gun it would go ding.

285
00:19:35,622 --> 00:19:38,960
Speaker 1: You'd have to shoot it with something better than that, you know, like certain sniper rifles.

286
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,079
Speaker 0: I think a Barrett could take one out maybe but what's it gonna do?

287
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:42,220
Speaker 1: good?

288
00:19:43,696 --> 00:19:46,047
Speaker 0: Um It'll do a little more than that.

289
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:48,418
Speaker 0: It won't catch on fire like the Hindenburg.

290
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:51,277
Speaker 1: No No, well that was because that one was poorly made.

291
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:56,514
Speaker 0: but well Yeah to dispel a common myth the Hindenburg did not burn because of what was in it.

292
00:19:56,794 --> 00:20:04,600
Speaker 0: the Hindenburg burn because people didn't understand Chemistry so well and they painted the outside of the Hindenburg with what was effectively rocket fuel.

293
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,248
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically that that's what happened.

294
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,375
Speaker 1: You know, the hydrogen would just gone poof.

295
00:20:09,515 --> 00:20:10,839
Speaker 1: It wouldn't have started burning like that.

296
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:16,180
Speaker 1: Yep Anyway, this particular airship fell into the sea and was lost.

297
00:20:16,661 --> 00:20:18,928
Speaker 1: Recently, they found it.

298
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,700
Speaker 1: some fisherman a commercial fisherman caught a piece of it in his net.

299
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:29,420
Speaker 1: it was some girder and he he showed it off at the local seafood restaurant and Thus be went huh?

300
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,825
Speaker 1: Where did you get that from?

301
00:20:30,865 --> 00:20:42,359
Speaker 1: and up lo and behold there's the airship and all sorts of other goodies under the sea that are fun to look at, you know, and it's especially fun to look at cuz It's a fucking airship.

302
00:20:43,281 --> 00:20:44,285
Speaker 1: So check out this thing of the day.

303
00:20:44,325 --> 00:20:46,232
Speaker 1: Look at the pictures of the sunken airship.

304
00:20:46,854 --> 00:20:47,737
Speaker 1: sunken airship.

305
00:20:47,797 --> 00:20:48,500
Speaker 1: Isn't that kind of funny?

306
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:55,380
Speaker 1: Well, you know it is a ship in the air But it's sunk in the water as opposed to like, you know floating out into space.

307
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,089
Speaker 0: Well first it sunk to the ground and then it kept sinking.

308
00:20:58,289 --> 00:20:58,570
Speaker 1: Yeah.

309
00:20:58,651 --> 00:20:58,892
Speaker 1: Yeah.

310
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,778
Speaker 0: Anyway, what can I say?

311
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:01,420
Speaker 0: I like airships.

312
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,228
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty damn cool.

313
00:21:03,268 --> 00:21:03,911
Speaker 1: Let me say that.

314
00:21:04,614 --> 00:21:05,619
Speaker 0: so my thing of the day.

315
00:21:06,721 --> 00:21:14,305
Speaker 0: I realized recently when I was talking about him that many of my friends have not actually seen his stand-up or didn't know that he Was anything other than mr.

316
00:21:14,345 --> 00:21:14,687
Speaker 0: Bean.

317
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:16,152
Speaker 1: I got mr.

318
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,618
Speaker 1: Bean stories used to calling mr.

319
00:21:17,638 --> 00:21:17,818
Speaker 1: Bean.

320
00:21:17,838 --> 00:21:20,373
Speaker 1: in high school At least a few people did you kind of look like mr.

321
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:21,379
Speaker 1: Bean a little bit.

322
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,102
Speaker 1: You looked like.

323
00:21:22,142 --> 00:21:24,531
Speaker 0: yes, you looked a lot more like him when we were freshmen.

324
00:21:24,752 --> 00:21:25,053
Speaker 1: Yeah.

325
00:21:25,355 --> 00:21:26,077
Speaker 0: Yeah, you did.

326
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:28,180
Speaker 1: All right Well, that was real close to high school.

327
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:36,885
Speaker 0: I mean not so much in your physical appearance But in your mannerisms and the way you walked around and moved your head around and looked at things And shifted your eyes.

328
00:21:36,906 --> 00:21:37,609
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

329
00:21:38,232 --> 00:21:38,956
Speaker 0: You had a mr.

330
00:21:38,996 --> 00:21:39,700
Speaker 0: Beanish manner.

331
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,067
Speaker 0: Alrighty, then there's a trait in burning wheel.

332
00:21:43,448 --> 00:21:46,736
Speaker 0: But anyway, Rowan Atkinson the man who did mr.

333
00:21:46,776 --> 00:21:49,545
Speaker 0: Bean while mr Bean is often hilarious.

334
00:21:50,026 --> 00:21:54,060
Speaker 0: I would say that it is probably near the bottom of the funny things he has done.

335
00:21:54,822 --> 00:21:57,810
Speaker 0: I mean the least funny thing Rowan Atkinson ever did was the mr.

336
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:01,100
Speaker 0: Bean movie, which is probably the second worst movie ever made.

337
00:22:01,401 --> 00:22:02,990
Speaker 1: I don't know a movie this mr.

338
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:03,432
Speaker 1: Bean movie.

339
00:22:03,633 --> 00:22:04,176
Speaker 0: It was called mr.

340
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:04,277
Speaker 0: Bean.

341
00:22:05,681 --> 00:22:07,387
Speaker 1: Okay, maybe y'all should see it sometime.

342
00:22:07,547 --> 00:22:11,866
Speaker 0: I would watch MD guys like eight or nine times before I'd watch that fucking mr Bean book is.

343
00:22:11,907 --> 00:22:13,159
Speaker 1: how could you not with you know?

344
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,860
Speaker 1: A guy shooting a guy through the head and then using the same gun as a grappling hook in there?

345
00:22:18,201 --> 00:22:22,574
Speaker 0: I would even watch Clifford almost once before I'd watch mr.

346
00:22:22,594 --> 00:22:22,814
Speaker 0: Bean.

347
00:22:23,155 --> 00:22:23,436
Speaker 1: Okay.

348
00:22:23,697 --> 00:22:27,006
Speaker 0: Good God, but anyway He's most well known for mr.

349
00:22:27,026 --> 00:22:29,656
Speaker 0: Bean, but he was also the black adder.

350
00:22:29,817 --> 00:22:37,740
Speaker 0: He was in the black adder which is an absolutely hilarious show and He was himself Rowan Atkinson doing stand-up stand-up skip comedy.

351
00:22:38,821 --> 00:22:55,720
Speaker 0: I've found on YouTube and Google video a collection of many of the routine Stand-up bits that he would do and if you have never seen such things as fatal beating or welcome to hell You've really missed out on one of the funniest comedians I can remember.

352
00:22:56,603 --> 00:23:00,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I mean the funniest in a comedian ever I had to say is Richard Pryor.

353
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,829
Speaker 1: But this stuff is also the hilarious.

354
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:04,516
Speaker 0: I pretty much Richard Pryor.

355
00:23:04,556 --> 00:23:05,380
Speaker 0: I put way up there.

356
00:23:05,661 --> 00:23:14,380
Speaker 1: The thing is the only reason I put Richard Pryor at the top is because I've watched a lot of stand-up comedy in my day Right, but one day randomly a freshman year at RIT.

357
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:19,669
Speaker 1: I remember it specifically like I knew who Richard Pryor was whatever But I was flipping through the channels.

358
00:23:19,709 --> 00:23:21,737
Speaker 1: cuz actually that was the last time I had television.

359
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:22,660
Speaker 0: breathe no more.

360
00:23:25,922 --> 00:23:41,286
Speaker 1: And I came upon Richard Pryor doing stand-up comedy on the TV Randomly and I was just uncontrollably Laughing it like from the time I switched to the to his channel to the time Beyond the time when it was over.

361
00:23:41,306 --> 00:23:46,099
Speaker 1: I just couldn't stop laughing harder and longer than anyone else.

362
00:23:46,686 --> 00:23:49,747
Speaker 1: See I gotta say though I think laughter is a good measure of the comedy.

363
00:23:49,988 --> 00:23:54,020
Speaker 0: Dana Carvey had a similar effect on me the first time I saw his HBO special.

364
00:23:54,742 --> 00:23:57,692
Speaker 0: Maybe maybe of course by the 80th time.

365
00:23:57,712 --> 00:23:59,539
Speaker 0: I wasn't laughing so much anymore.

366
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:10,135
Speaker 0: Yeah chopping broccoli Make a time make a to make a team make it to and in fact you Yeah, I mean like George Carlin Lewis black I love them all.

367
00:24:10,316 --> 00:24:13,669
Speaker 1: yeah, yeah I'm a big fan of comedy in general stand-up comedy.

368
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,275
Speaker 1: But yeah, awesome.

369
00:24:15,717 --> 00:24:23,660
Speaker 0: I still wish I Try to describe this comedians humor because then maybe one of you remember what his name was, but I can't really describe it.

370
00:24:24,308 --> 00:24:31,500
Speaker 0: I'll just let it lie But I'll let it be known that there was this comedian that I saw on Comedy Central three times three different shows.

371
00:24:32,281 --> 00:24:35,751
Speaker 0: Guy was utterly freaking hilarious and to this day.

372
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:38,699
Speaker 0: I have no idea who that was and I've never seen him again.

373
00:24:39,643 --> 00:24:41,331
Speaker 1: Was he the guy that died Hedberg?

374
00:24:41,351 --> 00:24:42,155
Speaker 0: No, it wasn't.

375
00:24:42,175 --> 00:24:43,320
Speaker 0: Hedberg wasn't Mitch Hedberg?

376
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:43,882
Speaker 1: Okay.

377
00:24:44,003 --> 00:24:46,213
Speaker 1: No, is that would explain why you never saw him again?

378
00:24:46,454 --> 00:24:47,459
Speaker 0: No, no, no, it was this.

379
00:24:48,322 --> 00:24:53,800
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna get into it because I barely remember anything about the guy and most of his jokes were more visual than they were.

380
00:24:54,283 --> 00:24:56,019
Speaker 1: Alright, well, let's get into our main bit then.

381
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,655
Speaker 0: Oh the main bit that we've been avoiding because it's kind of a throwaway episode.

382
00:24:59,755 --> 00:25:00,759
Speaker 1: Yeah the throw episode.

383
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:14,857
Speaker 1: now Some of our listeners particularly one unnamed listener has named Has been pushing very hard for us to do an episode about what we're going to do an episode about right now.

384
00:25:14,878 --> 00:25:29,980
Speaker 0: fact at Otakon during the geek nights meet-and-greet where we were hanging out with a bunch of our fans and have a grand old time He asked us while we had a recorder out Exactly the question that we're going to begin answering in part 1 of how to deal with the zombie apocalypse.

385
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:35,300
Speaker 1: Well, I don't like the word apocalypse because then you're assuming that it's a zombie apocalypse.

386
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,317
Speaker 1: It's basically how to deal with any number of zombie happenings.

387
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:43,090
Speaker 0: Yes I mean zombie apocalypse is one tip type of scenario.

388
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,217
Speaker 0: The problem is zombie apocalypse.

389
00:25:45,598 --> 00:25:47,425
Speaker 0: in the end You're pretty much always fucked.

390
00:25:47,586 --> 00:25:49,413
Speaker 1: Yeah, because you're assuming there's an apocalypse.

391
00:25:49,433 --> 00:25:51,100
Speaker 1: So it is the end of the world and you're done.

392
00:25:51,461 --> 00:26:00,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's pretty much the dawn of the dead and you can try to survive longer perhaps But the end result is the same if it is absolutely a zombie apocalypse.

393
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:06,700
Speaker 0: Luckily, you can't know during it if it is a zombie apocalypse or not or just a zombie outbreak.

394
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,604
Speaker 0: 88 days later showed us.

395
00:26:07,645 --> 00:26:07,785
Speaker 0: Yes.

396
00:26:07,826 --> 00:26:20,251
Speaker 1: Yes So yes the first thing you need to do when deciding how you're going to survive a zombie attack of some sort is Get information about the zombie attack.

397
00:26:20,593 --> 00:26:21,216
Speaker 0: Yeah now I get well.

398
00:26:21,236 --> 00:26:29,262
Speaker 0: before we go any further I just want to say that this is not going to be a multi-part in the sense that we're going to do a series on Zombies.

399
00:26:29,604 --> 00:26:32,655
Speaker 0: Oh, no, no, no, but every time we need to throw away Thursday.

400
00:26:32,735 --> 00:26:35,120
Speaker 0: I think it'll be instead of monkey Tuesday It'll be throwaway Thursday.

401
00:26:35,421 --> 00:26:37,548
Speaker 1: It's one of those geeky things that you know.

402
00:26:37,748 --> 00:26:44,032
Speaker 1: geeky people talk about and discuss for fun when they're bored and you know That's what we're gonna do when we got nothing better to talk about.

403
00:26:44,052 --> 00:26:45,780
Speaker 1: We'll just start talking about some hobbies.

404
00:26:46,241 --> 00:26:54,060
Speaker 0: So today we're going to go over how to figure out what kind of zombie attack it is and How we would determine what we're going to do.

405
00:26:54,120 --> 00:27:00,780
Speaker 0: But we can't talk about specifics because it really depends on the exact nature of the zombies that exists.

406
00:27:01,342 --> 00:27:05,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I mean what if there's a zombie outbreak in California and I'm in New York?

407
00:27:05,841 --> 00:27:07,739
Speaker 1: Well, that gives me a lot of time, doesn't it?

408
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:12,240
Speaker 0: Now what if they're slow-moving zombies that don't turn you into a zombie unless you die?

409
00:27:12,742 --> 00:27:16,459
Speaker 0: What if they're fast-moving zombies that turn you into a zombie if they so much as scratch you?

410
00:27:16,479 --> 00:27:18,458
Speaker 1: yeah What if rim is the first zombie?

411
00:27:19,562 --> 00:27:21,367
Speaker 0: Yeah, what are they lurching zombies?

412
00:27:21,447 --> 00:27:22,750
Speaker 0: Are they strong zombies?

413
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,014
Speaker 0: Are they magic zombies?

414
00:27:24,034 --> 00:27:25,097
Speaker 0: Are they science zombies?

415
00:27:25,117 --> 00:27:26,220
Speaker 0: Are they disease zombies?

416
00:27:27,881 --> 00:27:30,820
Speaker 1: Everything hinges on these questions and their answers.

417
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:36,980
Speaker 1: I mean It's changing the answer just slightly changes the whole strategy of how not to get killed and turn into a zombie.

418
00:27:37,341 --> 00:27:42,020
Speaker 0: Thus today we're mostly just going to talk about how to assess the zombie apocalypse.

419
00:27:42,781 --> 00:27:53,548
Speaker 1: Well, I think first what we should do is you should take things that are assumed to be true in any zombie situation that is zombies are Former humans of some sort.

420
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:56,199
Speaker 1: they were human and now they are something else.

421
00:27:56,662 --> 00:27:58,751
Speaker 0: yes, they may or may not have been dead.

422
00:27:58,771 --> 00:28:08,590
Speaker 0: they may or may not be dead and They seek to turn other humans into zombies by some means or in the very I mean They might not be able to turn you into a zombie at all.

423
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,420
Speaker 0: It might just be dead people.

424
00:28:10,902 --> 00:28:14,060
Speaker 0: It might just be I think the most common definition.

425
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:18,957
Speaker 1: But there is a danger of lit non zombie humans becoming zombies.

426
00:28:19,419 --> 00:28:23,320
Speaker 0: Yes Though I there are some situations I could see where that wouldn't be the case.

427
00:28:23,621 --> 00:28:29,640
Speaker 0: I mean say a meteor went by and woke up all the dead people, but then the meteor crashed and that stopped happening.

428
00:28:30,483 --> 00:28:40,060
Speaker 1: Oh, so only the graveyards had zombies and then there was a limited Finite number of zombies and all the living people were never zombies and they're just living people.

429
00:28:40,321 --> 00:28:41,447
Speaker 0: So that is a possibility.

430
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:42,151
Speaker 0: However remote.

431
00:28:42,412 --> 00:28:43,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, that would count.

432
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, now I guess I mean the way you could really distinguish the zombie attack here is that regardless of how they came about?

433
00:28:50,380 --> 00:29:10,310
Speaker 0: zombies either are generally aggressive toward humans and or other living things or zombies specifically are attempting to either kill people and turn them into zombies or They just have a hunger for brains that can't be satisfied any other way except the vegetarian zombies.

434
00:29:11,073 --> 00:29:12,518
Speaker 0: Don't go make that fucking joke.

435
00:29:12,739 --> 00:29:13,703
Speaker 1: Great.

436
00:29:14,245 --> 00:29:15,550
Speaker 0: I hate you so much.

437
00:29:17,533 --> 00:29:18,619
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, leave me alone.

438
00:29:18,639 --> 00:29:24,770
Speaker 0: Yeah throwaway Thursdays Alright.

439
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:42,261
Speaker 0: So so generally what we'll assume in any zombie case is that they are humanoid beings that were once human that have become Generally malevolent beings that have little intelligence and are attempting to harm and the very least humans Mm-hmm.

440
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:50,269
Speaker 1: Another thing you had to realize though I just I was thinking about the case you just brought up where all the dead people come back to life as zombies and that's it.

441
00:29:51,253 --> 00:29:54,370
Speaker 1: There are more people alive now than have ever died.

442
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:56,155
Speaker 1: Win that by.

443
00:29:56,436 --> 00:29:59,847
Speaker 0: you can't make a statement like that because we don't really know.

444
00:29:59,867 --> 00:30:00,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, we do.

445
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:01,532
Speaker 0: No, we don't.

446
00:30:01,572 --> 00:30:03,017
Speaker 0: that is that is a contention.

447
00:30:03,057 --> 00:30:04,963
Speaker 0: That is up to a great deal of debate.

448
00:30:05,043 --> 00:30:07,030
Speaker 0: And also what do you consider a human?

449
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,475
Speaker 0: What's the exact line?

450
00:30:08,535 --> 00:30:09,318
Speaker 0: just our species?

451
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:10,102
Speaker 0: What about hominids?

452
00:30:10,283 --> 00:30:12,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are zombie elephants.

453
00:30:12,051 --> 00:30:13,209
Speaker 1: We're definitely in trouble.

454
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:14,163
Speaker 0: So I'll be monkeys.

455
00:30:14,366 --> 00:30:22,703
Speaker 0: a Normal monkey could kill both of us if this room there were a monkey here in that blue chair and that monkey wanted to kill Us unless it was a spider monkey.

456
00:30:22,844 --> 00:30:29,269
Speaker 0: We'd both be dead Yeah, and if it was a spider monkey one of us would still be dead or at least covered in shit.

457
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:32,639
Speaker 1: Vomit and god knows what other kind of mess.

458
00:30:33,141 --> 00:30:34,307
Speaker 0: god spider monkeys.

459
00:30:34,427 --> 00:30:38,509
Speaker 1: Yeah so How should we begin?

460
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:43,185
Speaker 0: She'll propose a scenario and then or just generally how to react.

461
00:30:43,205 --> 00:30:44,028
Speaker 0: we could talk about that.

462
00:30:44,048 --> 00:30:46,157
Speaker 0: All right All right, so let's say we don't know.

463
00:30:46,238 --> 00:30:53,309
Speaker 0: let's say we're sitting here doing geek nights right now And our friend Scott Johnson calls the cell phone that's sitting next to me the ringers off and I ignore it.

464
00:30:53,913 --> 00:30:56,169
Speaker 0: He calls it five or six more times.

465
00:30:56,591 --> 00:30:59,038
Speaker 0: So I think huh and I pick the phone up.

466
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:06,521
Speaker 0: and Scott Johnson being the stalwart defender against all things malevolent Because you know your friend Scott Johnson is waiting for this day.

467
00:31:07,444 --> 00:31:09,490
Speaker 0: He is the first line of defense.

468
00:31:09,731 --> 00:31:12,470
Speaker 0: He is nor ad when it comes to zombies and vampires.

469
00:31:12,891 --> 00:31:19,734
Speaker 0: Basically, if any of those come to exist Scott Johnson will call the both of us first and tell us it begins and then we'll Do whatever.

470
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:20,037
Speaker 0: do it.

471
00:31:20,643 --> 00:31:21,370
Speaker 1: I pick up the phone.

472
00:31:21,812 --> 00:31:25,848
Speaker 1: The first thing you have to do is get someone in the world to be your nor ad.

473
00:31:26,029 --> 00:31:27,715
Speaker 0: yes We have Scott Johnson.

474
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,545
Speaker 0: You could have us but now you're one degree away.

475
00:31:30,846 --> 00:31:32,010
Speaker 0: You won't get worn right away.

476
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,950
Speaker 0: I am going to do things before I warn you about this.

477
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,797
Speaker 1: I can also be a nor ad.

478
00:31:36,877 --> 00:31:42,137
Speaker 1: the problem with that is you need to spend every waking moment of your life in a Constant vigil for zombie happenings.

479
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:42,559
Speaker 0: Yes.

480
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:43,924
Speaker 0: No, you could narrow it down.

481
00:31:43,964 --> 00:31:48,357
Speaker 0: I mean Scott Johnson is a Evil magic or evil zombie.

482
00:31:48,397 --> 00:31:48,819
Speaker 0: nor ad.

483
00:31:48,859 --> 00:31:49,661
Speaker 0: he's really broad.

484
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:51,666
Speaker 0: He's watching for vampires.

485
00:31:51,907 --> 00:31:52,970
Speaker 0: He's watching for magic.

486
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,195
Speaker 0: He's watching for all of that.

487
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:57,027
Speaker 0: If you're just a zombie nor ad it's real easy.

488
00:31:57,087 --> 00:31:57,750
Speaker 0: Just watch the news.

489
00:31:58,851 --> 00:32:05,810
Speaker 0: Just watch all the news and the moment you hear about a disease anywhere that isn't explained go to like Def Con 2 and wait.

490
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,393
Speaker 0: Yeah That's really it.

491
00:32:08,474 --> 00:32:09,718
Speaker 0: All you can do is watch the news.

492
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,862
Speaker 1: Hmm unless the zombies are happening in your town Yeah, but even then you're you all.

493
00:32:14,882 --> 00:32:16,149
Speaker 0: you just kind of be generally wary.

494
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:17,345
Speaker 0: Mmm-hmm.

495
00:32:18,092 --> 00:32:24,221
Speaker 1: Make sure when you see someone walking on the street if they're walking kind of slow if they got their hands out in front of Them go check them out.

496
00:32:24,301 --> 00:32:26,951
Speaker 1: Make sure you know, they're not Zombified.

497
00:32:27,473 --> 00:32:31,248
Speaker 1: Yeah, because seriously it could be that just one zombie and that's it.

498
00:32:31,891 --> 00:32:37,890
Speaker 0: However, Scott Johnson the nor ad the one thing that he is always impressed upon us in his knowledge of being a zombie.

499
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:53,927
Speaker 0: Nor ad is that if you ever come across a zombie or Vampire or anything like that that immediately makes the odds that other similar things exist go from practically zero To not one but an infinitely larger number.

500
00:32:53,947 --> 00:33:03,369
Speaker 0: Yep I mean if you see one zombie That's when you start grabbing crosses and see if they work on things Start digging up people that you might think are vampires and staking them.

501
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:06,882
Speaker 1: So when you get like Necronomicon and start reading them, yep.

502
00:33:06,922 --> 00:33:07,123
Speaker 0: Yep.

503
00:33:07,143 --> 00:33:09,110
Speaker 0: You start trying to cast spells just in case.

504
00:33:09,471 --> 00:33:13,165
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I don't try to cast spells every day only because the odds are they won't work.

505
00:33:13,586 --> 00:33:15,915
Speaker 0: if I run into a vampire You can bet your ass.

506
00:33:15,935 --> 00:33:19,390
Speaker 0: I'm gonna find every old skin bound book I can get and read every word out loud.

507
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:24,388
Speaker 1: I'll be sacrificing the lambs and shit trying to get some spell action going on.

508
00:33:24,449 --> 00:33:28,430
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, so again, the first thing you have to do is have intelligence.

509
00:33:28,551 --> 00:33:30,201
Speaker 0: That is probably the most important thing.

510
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:40,212
Speaker 0: the sooner you figure out What kinds of zombies these are and what kind of threat they pose the better chance you have of surviving until the end and possibly winning Mm-hmm.

511
00:33:40,733 --> 00:33:52,476
Speaker 1: Now you might be able if you're lucky to get all this information from the news and the internet and your friends and such because someone else far away will figure it out and Disseminate the information around the world.

512
00:33:52,577 --> 00:33:57,133
Speaker 0: However, if zombie movies are any indication, that's not gonna fucking happen Anything.

513
00:33:57,153 --> 00:34:06,058
Speaker 0: you'll turn on the news and you'll see a reporter freaking out and then being killed by a zombie and then there won't be any useful radio Television or anything even your hair.

514
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:11,429
Speaker 1: you're gonna have to rely on your ham radio guys and those guys There are usually fat so they won't be.

515
00:34:12,712 --> 00:34:16,250
Speaker 0: So the step to know at least one radio nerd.

516
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:23,330
Speaker 0: Every zombie movie worth its salt has the one guy who has the radio and he's the one who makes contact with that one other.

517
00:34:24,292 --> 00:34:27,804
Speaker 1: Or if you're seriously worried about zombies because I got to be honest, I'm not.

518
00:34:28,206 --> 00:34:32,949
Speaker 1: even though I'm prepared I'm not worried about zombies because the chances of zombies are pretty much yes.

519
00:34:33,074 --> 00:34:42,149
Speaker 0: I mean I'm ready for zombies if I hear that zombies exist Instead of freaking out because the normal human reaction is to freak out for like five minutes before you deal with it.

520
00:34:42,652 --> 00:34:44,058
Speaker 0: I'm ready, so I won't freak out.

521
00:34:44,319 --> 00:34:55,810
Speaker 1: I'll immediately a Mac enact rims zombie plan Yes But if you are worried about it I suggest becoming a ham radio hobbyist to getting your license and everything like that because that'll help a lot more than many other things.

522
00:34:56,071 --> 00:35:00,470
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean medicine is not gonna work so well, especially if they're infecting zombies.

523
00:35:00,711 --> 00:35:03,521
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're basically your second skill that you're gonna want.

524
00:35:03,581 --> 00:35:08,300
Speaker 1: after ham radio skill is gun the skill Alright, so here's the important question.

525
00:35:08,681 --> 00:35:10,690
Speaker 0: You can you've got intelligence, you know zombies exist.

526
00:35:11,354 --> 00:35:14,129
Speaker 0: What information do you need before you can figure out what to do?

527
00:35:14,952 --> 00:35:22,382
Speaker 0: You need to know very briefly one what kinds of zombies they are What creates them?

528
00:35:22,482 --> 00:35:23,609
Speaker 0: Where do they come from?

529
00:35:24,452 --> 00:35:26,047
Speaker 0: how can they be killed?

530
00:35:26,067 --> 00:35:31,270
Speaker 0: and Is there any like special thing like a special secret thing?

531
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:39,429
Speaker 0: you know the plot point at the end of the movie like ah, if you say was it was it they explode or They only last one nights?

532
00:35:39,791 --> 00:35:41,518
Speaker 1: Yeah, the other thing you have to know.

533
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,936
Speaker 1: if they poke what threat to these zombies posed to you They might be benign zombies.

534
00:35:46,136 --> 00:35:49,910
Speaker 1: It could be you know, they just walk around aimlessly and do nothing and then they die.

535
00:35:50,991 --> 00:35:53,818
Speaker 0: Yep, and also where did they spawn?

536
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,410
Speaker 0: Did they all come from one place that they simultaneously appear all around the world?

537
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:04,490
Speaker 0: That is really key because in the case of the former everything's gonna be okay.

538
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,410
Speaker 0: It's probably gonna be like a really easy cakewalk.

539
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:11,026
Speaker 0: If you know either a disease or something 88 something you'll get.

540
00:36:11,046 --> 00:36:11,810
Speaker 0: you'll feel safe yourself.

541
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:19,349
Speaker 1: Yeah, if it was all in one place You know the National Guard or your country's military will surround that place and you'll have no problems.

542
00:36:19,409 --> 00:36:21,010
Speaker 0: plus It's probably a freak accident.

543
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:33,910
Speaker 0: It's probably either some disease got loose or some portal to a dark world open or some necromance are fucked up Necromancer, but if zombies are appearing all over the world simultaneously You might have a Dawn of the Dead situation.

544
00:36:34,051 --> 00:36:38,230
Speaker 1: You might have a very bad situation because you basically can't run away anywhere.

545
00:36:38,371 --> 00:36:46,110
Speaker 1: You need to hole up and survive for as long as possible Perhaps in some sort of biodome or farm or space shuttle.

546
00:36:46,672 --> 00:36:49,965
Speaker 0: So I guess in or boat in order of what you need to know.

547
00:36:50,246 --> 00:36:51,170
Speaker 0: you start with.

548
00:36:51,511 --> 00:36:56,390
Speaker 0: Where are the zombies right now if they're in LA and you're in New York?

549
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:59,890
Speaker 0: You have a lot more time to plan if they're down the street.

550
00:37:00,355 --> 00:37:07,790
Speaker 0: You've got to act immediately Mmm, so figure that out before you do anything and then right after that figure out what kind of zombie that is.

551
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:09,133
Speaker 0: That is.

552
00:37:09,475 --> 00:37:12,130
Speaker 0: that is probably the biggest factor in your survival.

553
00:37:13,052 --> 00:37:14,559
Speaker 0: You can break it into a whole bunch of elements.

554
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,090
Speaker 0: Are they fast zombies or slow zombies?

555
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:18,747
Speaker 1: Yeah, are they?

556
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:24,846
Speaker 1: Zombies that can turn you into a zombie or are they zombies that just kind of don't do anything?

557
00:37:25,227 --> 00:37:32,509
Speaker 0: if they're the former Do they do it by biting your neck by killing you by scratching you by being near you?

558
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:35,389
Speaker 1: Are the zombies strong or are they weak?

559
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:41,830
Speaker 1: You know do they wander around aimlessly or do they smell your brains and come after them quickly?

560
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:44,397
Speaker 0: Are they living or dead?

561
00:37:44,938 --> 00:37:51,581
Speaker 0: if they're actually dead then it's either going to be one of those headshot Situations or destroy the head situations.

562
00:37:51,721 --> 00:37:54,130
Speaker 0: or you know some magical solution situation.

563
00:37:55,193 --> 00:37:57,099
Speaker 1: How are the zombies destroyed?

564
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:58,483
Speaker 1: can they be destroyed?

565
00:37:58,503 --> 00:38:04,023
Speaker 0: because if they're living if they're living beings with a disease You can fight them the way you would fight anyone on PCP.

566
00:38:04,525 --> 00:38:04,605
Speaker 0: Mmm.

567
00:38:04,665 --> 00:38:05,750
Speaker 0: You just beat them to death.

568
00:38:06,091 --> 00:38:07,216
Speaker 1: Yeah, can they?

569
00:38:07,276 --> 00:38:07,939
Speaker 1: can they jump?

570
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:08,963
Speaker 1: can they climb?

571
00:38:09,044 --> 00:38:10,470
Speaker 1: How can you slow them down?

572
00:38:10,591 --> 00:38:13,110
Speaker 1: Will they be able to break through a barrier, you know?

573
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:15,320
Speaker 1: Can you hold them off instead of killing them all?

574
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,470
Speaker 0: can they detect humans or not?

575
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,574
Speaker 0: And if so, how?

576
00:38:18,895 --> 00:38:19,638
Speaker 0: what draws them?

577
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:20,682
Speaker 0: are they attracted to light?

578
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,490
Speaker 0: are they attracted to shopping malls?

579
00:38:23,715 --> 00:38:27,416
Speaker 1: Are they attracted to Underground, you know train tracks?

580
00:38:27,757 --> 00:38:31,750
Speaker 0: if they see a human do they become aggressive or they just attack anything in front of them?

581
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:34,618
Speaker 0: Mmm, do they attack non humans?

582
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,926
Speaker 1: Do they attack non living things?

583
00:38:37,026 --> 00:38:38,130
Speaker 0: Do they attack each other?

584
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:41,090
Speaker 1: Do they even attack or do they just go around aimlessly?

585
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:45,470
Speaker 0: Do they just swipe if you're nearby and you also have to worry about a lot of tricky situations.

586
00:38:45,571 --> 00:38:47,290
Speaker 0: I mean fast or slow zombie, right?

587
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:52,503
Speaker 0: I mean you've seen fast zombies, you know The zombie that runs at full tilt at you and then tears you apart.

588
00:38:52,683 --> 00:38:58,634
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then the slow shuffling Brains.

589
00:38:58,714 --> 00:39:01,970
Speaker 0: but zombie cannot swallow this injustice.

590
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:10,109
Speaker 0: But there's a really tricky situation you got to watch out for and this has been a furious subject of debate among the front row crew.

591
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:18,310
Speaker 0: Lunging zombies are one of the most dangerous kinds of zombies because they give all the appearances of a slow zombie.

592
00:39:18,653 --> 00:39:29,162
Speaker 0: They shuffle slowly and slowly Brains, but then when you're within, you know, eight feet They suddenly lunge like as fast as lightning and get you.

593
00:39:29,183 --> 00:39:31,590
Speaker 0: Mmm, but you won't know that right away.

594
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:35,530
Speaker 0: It's real hard to figure out if it's a lunging zombie or not without letting someone die.

595
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:50,290
Speaker 1: now the worst thing that can kill you you know is if they're a mixed bag if some zombies are fast and some are slow if some are strong and some are weak if some can get you with A scratch and some with a bite then you basically need to be prepared for all these different situations.

596
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:57,955
Speaker 1: You know if some get killed with a headshot and some get killed with a silver bullet you're gonna need to get like silver Shotgun shells.

597
00:39:58,015 --> 00:40:02,350
Speaker 1: it's it's really gonna suck and it things just get worse when you have a mixed bag of zombies.

598
00:40:02,873 --> 00:40:05,990
Speaker 1: So you better hope that there's just one kind of zombie.

599
00:40:06,673 --> 00:40:10,127
Speaker 1: You better hope there's no kind but one kind any more than one kind.

600
00:40:10,147 --> 00:40:10,770
Speaker 1: you're in trouble.

601
00:40:11,892 --> 00:40:15,790
Speaker 0: So, let's say for the sake of argument that the zombies are in your town.

602
00:40:16,151 --> 00:40:19,942
Speaker 0: You don't know the situation in the rest of the world, but you know, they're in your town.

603
00:40:20,263 --> 00:40:22,670
Speaker 0: You can see them down the street.

604
00:40:23,774 --> 00:40:29,902
Speaker 1: All right, step one Can you get to the grocery store without going through the zombies?

605
00:40:30,544 --> 00:40:31,166
Speaker 0: Well, I think.

606
00:40:31,226 --> 00:40:32,290
Speaker 1: or the hardware store?

607
00:40:32,332 --> 00:40:34,637
Speaker 0: Yeah well before you do anything don't even worry about that.

608
00:40:34,877 --> 00:40:45,882
Speaker 0: get some binoculars or something and try to observe the zombies because hopefully Some curious neighbors will wander out and see what's going on and you can watch to see if they're lunging zombies or not if they're Fast or slow all that stuff.

609
00:40:46,205 --> 00:40:52,709
Speaker 0: Mmm I mean if they're slow zombies and and they're not lunging or anything, even if they're killing people don't fucking worry about it.

610
00:40:53,031 --> 00:40:54,397
Speaker 0: Yeah, those kind of zombies.

611
00:40:54,658 --> 00:40:57,110
Speaker 0: You could probably just close your door and go back to playing video games.

612
00:40:57,694 --> 00:40:59,930
Speaker 1: Maybe maybe but it also might be fun.

613
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:02,690
Speaker 1: See, here's the thing, you know, that's the safest thing to do.

614
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:08,829
Speaker 1: But you might want to go get in your car and run them over for fun Especially if you have a nice big truck.

615
00:41:10,072 --> 00:41:15,298
Speaker 0: But then you got to figure out if they're slow like let's say all right, we observe them We see that they're slow killing zombies.

616
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,682
Speaker 0: They are killing people.

617
00:41:16,963 --> 00:41:18,547
Speaker 0: when they see humans they go after them.

618
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:22,070
Speaker 0: now We got to figure out if they're massing anywhere or not.

619
00:41:22,311 --> 00:41:23,675
Speaker 0: Are they organized in any way?

620
00:41:24,016 --> 00:41:28,569
Speaker 0: because if it looks like they're massing the answer is always get the fuck out of town.

621
00:41:30,172 --> 00:41:33,630
Speaker 0: Because if they're massing that means you'll go to sleep you'll wake up in the morning.

622
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:36,826
Speaker 0: Now your house is surrounded by more zombies than you can kill.

623
00:41:36,846 --> 00:41:40,310
Speaker 0: at that point You're dead because you won't get enough food and you'll starve to death.

624
00:41:40,591 --> 00:41:46,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean you could like if there's a mass somewhere but it's not near your house.

625
00:41:46,771 --> 00:41:55,969
Speaker 1: you might be able to pull a trick like a throwing a Exploding propane tank making a big gap in the zombies and then driving through it to escape or something like that.

626
00:41:56,591 --> 00:41:59,261
Speaker 1: But you can't let the mass for too long or else.

627
00:41:59,341 --> 00:42:01,730
Speaker 1: It's too big for even a propane tank explosion.

628
00:42:02,931 --> 00:42:07,710
Speaker 0: Now we don't get a lot of go long on this and there's also the fact that we did this episode mostly as a throwaway.

629
00:42:08,131 --> 00:42:13,390
Speaker 0: But in the future when we do more of these episodes, I think we can illustrate a fairly important point.

630
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:16,310
Speaker 0: There's actually a moral to all of these zombie episodes.

631
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:19,622
Speaker 1: We love morality turn turn turn the moral.

632
00:42:20,003 --> 00:42:26,728
Speaker 0: and we talked today, you know about gathering the intelligence And we'll probably talk next time we do this about weapons and that sort of thing.

633
00:42:26,808 --> 00:42:27,330
Speaker 1: the fun part

634
00:42:27,531 --> 00:42:48,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, but in terms of this discussion think of it this way We are geeks we also have no drama in our lives and We very rarely have trouble because we usually plan ahead for just about everything every Possible contingency or at least we put ourselves in a situation where well, we haven't planned for a particular contingency.

635
00:42:48,492 --> 00:42:56,063
Speaker 0: we are ready to deal with it regardless of whether or not we've prepared and The key is simply to approach any problem in your life.

636
00:42:56,304 --> 00:42:57,689
Speaker 0: No matter what that problem is.

637
00:42:58,171 --> 00:43:05,538
Speaker 0: Logically if you wake up one day and you walk outside and there's a dragon just sleeping in the street Don't freak out and run around immediately.

638
00:43:05,578 --> 00:43:07,565
Speaker 0: Just think why is this dragon here?

639
00:43:08,207 --> 00:43:09,090
Speaker 0: What might he want?

640
00:43:09,452 --> 00:43:10,300
Speaker 0: Is he looking at me?

641
00:43:10,361 --> 00:43:11,169
Speaker 0: Is he going to kill me?

642
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:16,710
Speaker 0: How can I deal with this situation in a productive constructive and possibly life-saving way?

643
00:43:18,351 --> 00:43:40,389
Speaker 1: Another thing you can look at it is a lot of people in this world completely lack Basic problem-solving skills, you know, they might know a lot of stuff and they might not be stupid But you know if their computer is broken or their car is broken They can't apply basic logic and saying oh this is caused by that Which means the problem must be in this area and such and such and such.

644
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:42,376
Speaker 0: Yeah approach things logically.

645
00:43:42,476 --> 00:43:43,359
Speaker 0: at least try to.

646
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:47,656
Speaker 0: if you if something bad happens at least try to figure out why it happened.

647
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,648
Speaker 0: if there's a way you can avoid it in the future.

648
00:43:49,668 --> 00:44:01,429
Speaker 1: and Trying to figure out how to survive various zombie scenarios is a great exercise of your Problem-solving muscle and will help you in other areas of life in which you must solve problems.

649
00:44:02,293 --> 00:44:03,156
Speaker 0: You know, you know what?

650
00:44:03,176 --> 00:44:06,650
Speaker 0: I love more than anything and I think we'll end on this, you know being throwaway Thursday.

651
00:44:06,911 --> 00:44:13,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, we managed to turn a throwaway episode about killing fucking zombies into some sort of moral lesson.

652
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:17,667
Speaker 1: yeah, so we're gonna have real episodes next week.

653
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:22,293
Speaker 1: and then Next Friday Saturday and Sunday is Sitakan.
