1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,197
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, July 24th, 2019.

2
00:00:12,197 --> 00:00:15,001
Speaker 1: I'm Rym, and this is Geek Nights.

3
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:20,170
Speaker 1: Tonight, we are talking about that kappa anime, Sarazanmai.

4
00:00:22,652 --> 00:00:23,666
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,909
Speaker 1: There's some kappa and some butt stuff.

6
00:00:30,457 --> 00:00:33,088
Speaker 1: Yeah, not Furikappa, the original, the OG.

7
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:34,463
Speaker 0: No one knows Furikappa.

8
00:00:34,971 --> 00:00:40,030
Speaker 1: We've talked about Furikappa probably more than any other anime podcast in human history.

9
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,090
Speaker 0: It is my favorite pre-school anime.

10
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:48,010
Speaker 1: It is also my favorite pre-school anime, and I think it's my second favorite kappa centric anime.

11
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:49,820
Speaker 0: I don't know if Doraemon is like pre-school.

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,168
Speaker 0: I feel it's more kindergarten, right?

13
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,849
Speaker 0: Because you guys sort of have to know more language to talk about Doraemon.

14
00:00:53,990 --> 00:01:00,470
Speaker 1: I think it's my second favorite kappa, because I think Sarazanmai is a better kappa focused anime based on the episodes we've seen.

15
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,009
Speaker 0: Furikappa is even below Sesame Street level.

16
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:07,730
Speaker 0: In Sesame Street, if you're in elementary school, you're watching Sesame Street, Doraemon, whatever.

17
00:01:08,852 --> 00:01:11,810
Speaker 0: So, I feel like Furikappa is definitely pre-school.

18
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:16,410
Speaker 1: So, you noticed we didn't do a show Monday, which usually...

19
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:16,752
Speaker 0: I came.

20
00:01:16,812 --> 00:01:17,858
Speaker 0: I was ready to do a show.

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,890
Speaker 0: Even though there was no topic, I was ready to do a show.

22
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:20,332
Speaker 1: I was pissed.

23
00:01:20,492 --> 00:01:34,010
Speaker 1: It was funny, because for one thing, I had just spent a good chunk of my day arguing with people online about how New York is objectively superior to every other place on Earth and how cars should be banned and the subway, which is all true.

24
00:01:34,331 --> 00:01:40,674
Speaker 0: I mean, in total, if you add up all the things about New York, positive and negative, it is the best place on Earth.

25
00:01:40,755 --> 00:01:51,630
Speaker 0: But at each individual thing, except for maybe things like pizza, bagels, you know, things like that, there are many places that can easily beat New York in individual areas.

26
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:56,610
Speaker 1: But a place where that is not true is Intra-City Mass Transit.

27
00:01:59,191 --> 00:01:59,665
Speaker 0: There's Tokyo.

28
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:07,730
Speaker 1: Tokyo actually doesn't go to that many places, and there's all different companies that run it, so you can't have the same card at every subway.

29
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,410
Speaker 0: I'm sure the trains run more on time.

30
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:09,990
Speaker 1: Not at night.

31
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,690
Speaker 1: They don't run at night, and they don't run that often.

32
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,250
Speaker 0: Aren't people working super late, though?

33
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,874
Speaker 1: Yeah, fuck you.

34
00:02:15,894 --> 00:02:16,437
Speaker 1: It sucks.

35
00:02:17,141 --> 00:02:17,967
Speaker 1: London's the same way.

36
00:02:18,047 --> 00:02:18,349
Speaker 1: London...

37
00:02:18,611 --> 00:02:19,790
Speaker 0: I know it doesn't run that late at night.

38
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,536
Speaker 0: And it doesn't actually go to the... The trains are nicer.

39
00:02:21,556 --> 00:02:22,730
Speaker 0: The underground trains are a lot nicer.

40
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,518
Speaker 1: No, they're not.

41
00:02:23,538 --> 00:02:24,429
Speaker 1: They're not air-conditioned.

42
00:02:24,954 --> 00:02:25,410
Speaker 0: Not at all?

43
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:25,812
Speaker 0: No!

44
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:29,130
Speaker 1: The London Underground actually kind of sucks.

45
00:02:29,752 --> 00:02:31,070
Speaker 0: But the trains are a lot newer and nicer.

46
00:02:31,493 --> 00:02:32,969
Speaker 1: Have you ever even been to London?

47
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,554
Speaker 0: I've seen them.

48
00:02:33,675 --> 00:02:34,564
Speaker 0: I look to trains online.

49
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:43,584
Speaker 1: So the London Underground one does not actually... It has so few stations and covers so little ground and has so little density.

50
00:02:43,624 --> 00:02:46,970
Speaker 1: compared to New York, it's usually not useful to get where you're going.

51
00:02:48,231 --> 00:02:53,950
Speaker 1: And part of that is because a lot of... Like, in New York, people come in to, like, Grand Central, Penn Station.

52
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,239
Speaker 1: There's not that many places.

53
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:58,450
Speaker 1: They come into the city and then they transfer to the subway.

54
00:02:58,952 --> 00:03:05,843
Speaker 1: In London, there's a lot more light rail, so people will take the equivalent of the LIRR to wherever it is.

55
00:03:05,863 --> 00:03:06,670
Speaker 1: they work in London.

56
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,989
Speaker 0: The Harry Potter place.

57
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they don't necessarily need to, like, then get on the Underground.

58
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:15,329
Speaker 1: Also, the London Underground trains don't hold that many people and are really small.

59
00:03:16,092 --> 00:03:17,670
Speaker 1: Like, not that many cars.

60
00:03:17,991 --> 00:03:23,350
Speaker 1: People who have not been to New York do not understand how many fucking people fit into one train of a New York City subway.

61
00:03:23,514 --> 00:03:24,230
Speaker 0: Oh, like thousands.

62
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,670
Speaker 1: Paris is, like, the only place where the trains run at night other than New York.

63
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,450
Speaker 0: I thought they don't run at night.

64
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,209
Speaker 1: No, Paris is, like, the one place where they do.

65
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:31,983
Speaker 0: I thought they don't.

66
00:03:32,614 --> 00:03:33,188
Speaker 1: Paris they do.

67
00:03:33,451 --> 00:03:33,788
Speaker 0: Are you sure?

68
00:03:34,454 --> 00:03:35,770
Speaker 1: I don't think they run all night.

69
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,810
Speaker 0: I thought New York was the only one where they run all night.

70
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,410
Speaker 1: Paris they run pretty much all night.

71
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:48,610
Speaker 0: Anyway... I mean, there are places that have better total transportation pictures, like mostly Netherlands, Amsterdam...

72
00:03:49,053 --> 00:03:51,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, partly because they're tiny and have a very low population density.

73
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:54,626
Speaker 0: Also because they got rid of cars in, like, the '70s and '80s.

74
00:03:55,390 --> 00:04:08,570
Speaker 1: But in terms of a normal human being, 24/7, getting from one part of New York City to another part of New York City, the subway is crazy amazing, considering that it's 100 years old and we spend almost no money maintaining it.

75
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,108
Speaker 0: And always broken.

76
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:13,470
Speaker 1: Always broken, but the broken subway still gets me there faster than driving would.

77
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:16,129
Speaker 0: Not really.

78
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:18,010
Speaker 1: Unless you're going between Brooklyn and Queens.

79
00:04:18,231 --> 00:04:19,009
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was going to say.

80
00:04:19,471 --> 00:04:20,189
Speaker 1: So here's my point.

81
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:25,390
Speaker 1: It's Monday when we tried to do the show, I couldn't get home because the subways were just fucked by the rain.

82
00:04:26,271 --> 00:04:29,527
Speaker 1: So that was interesting because I just argued that we should ban cars.

83
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,830
Speaker 0: I'm sure if it rains in Tokyo, the trains are working just fine.

84
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:39,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, but my point was that cars were not getting anyone anywhere faster that night.

85
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,517
Speaker 0: No, I wouldn't...

86
00:04:41,931 --> 00:04:47,750
Speaker 1: There was like a two-hour delay driving out of Manhattan, so the subway still got me home faster.

87
00:04:48,172 --> 00:04:51,070
Speaker 1: But it did not get me home fast enough to do the show.

88
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,229
Speaker 1: There's no way I was expecting Scott to wait here for an hour.

89
00:04:56,111 --> 00:05:05,570
Speaker 1: So yeah, we just didn't do a Monday show, which I think it's notable though, it's the first time we bailed on a Monday show because we were physically prevented from doing the show as opposed to...

90
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:06,667
Speaker 0: At least on a punctual...

91
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,504
Speaker 1: Yeah, because we just didn't have an idea.

92
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,590
Speaker 0: We also didn't have an idea though.

93
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,269
Speaker 1: But I feel like we could have come up with one.

94
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,589
Speaker 1: We were gonna do a show no matter what.

95
00:05:16,134 --> 00:05:19,869
Speaker 1: I was about to say come hell or high water, but high water actually prevented us from doing the show.

96
00:05:20,231 --> 00:05:21,049
Speaker 0: It wasn't even that high.

97
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,530
Speaker 1: It wasn't that high, but it was high enough.

98
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,308
Speaker 0: Medium water.

99
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:29,370
Speaker 1: Did you see the video of the person who got out of their car and just like unclogged the drain in the tunnel and then the flood went away?

100
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:29,939
Speaker 0: Yeah, I shared that video.

101
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:30,609
Speaker 0: That's why you saw it.

102
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,345
Speaker 1: Everyone shared that video.

103
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:32,649
Speaker 1: Fark!

104
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:34,850
Speaker 1: That was on the front page of Fark.

105
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,269
Speaker 0: And I was like, "Hey, they should go up and be friends with our thing of the

106
00:05:38,309 --> 00:05:38,510
Speaker 0: day.".

107
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,210
Speaker 1: The culvert draining guy.

108
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:39,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, the culvert guy.

109
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:40,299
Speaker 0: Yeah.

110
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,487
Speaker 1: Does he got any news?

111
00:05:42,992 --> 00:05:44,549
Speaker 0: No, I don't have any news really.

112
00:05:44,731 --> 00:05:46,050
Speaker 1: Alright, I guess we'll get it out of the way.

113
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,549
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, there was a San Diego Comic-Con.

114
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,482
Speaker 0: And there was... Oh yeah, a ton of stuff got announced.

115
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:52,470
Speaker 1: MCU, whatever.

116
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,610
Speaker 0: Right, which means there are Eisner Award winners.

117
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:55,986
Speaker 0: You can look them up yourself.

118
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,130
Speaker 0: I actually haven't read most of them, so that's why.

119
00:06:00,391 --> 00:06:05,529
Speaker 0: I looked at the list and I was like, "Oh, usually on Geek Nights, I talk about the list of Eisner Award winners and like ones that are...".

120
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:09,989
Speaker 0: But it's like I really have read almost none to none of them, so I can't really say much about them.

121
00:06:10,512 --> 00:06:12,748
Speaker 0: How much I agree or disagree or anything like that.

122
00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:18,290
Speaker 0: And yeah, most of the news from San Diego Comic-Con was not...

123
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,429
Speaker 1: Live action Hollywood movies.

124
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:26,550
Speaker 0: Right, it's like there wasn't really, you know, too much that was getting really exciting there.

125
00:06:27,252 --> 00:06:30,550
Speaker 0: So, you know, that was in my wheelhouse to discuss.

126
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,062
Speaker 1: Yup.

127
00:06:32,096 --> 00:06:36,562
Speaker 0: It was, you know, it's mostly like, "Oh my God, here's the superhero movies we're gonna make that Scott's not gonna

128
00:06:36,602 --> 00:06:37,110
Speaker 0: watch.".

129
00:06:37,232 --> 00:06:37,537
Speaker 0: And I said,

130
00:06:37,618 --> 00:06:38,288
Speaker 0: "Okay.".

131
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:39,570
Speaker 1: So I guess we'll get it out of the way.

132
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:44,550
Speaker 1: We can't avoid talking about the terrifying tragedy that happened to Kyoto Animation.

133
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,190
Speaker 0: I mean, but what is there to say about it other than it was a terrifying, horrifying tragedy.

134
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:49,685
Speaker 1: Yup.

135
00:06:50,394 --> 00:06:50,985
Speaker 1: Well, it's to the...

136
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:55,809
Speaker 0: Things like this happen far too often, which is more than zero times is too often.

137
00:06:56,611 --> 00:07:05,229
Speaker 1: As an American, it's easy to be numb to this because we have mass shootings that kill similar numbers of people often enough to where they don't even all make the news.

138
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:06,063
Speaker 0: Yup, yup, yup.

139
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:21,530
Speaker 1: But it's also important, like I want to impress on like American anime fans that this is not on the scale of a tragedy that affected the anime industry so much as like a giant national tragedy for the nation of Japan.

140
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:31,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think people definitely in the United States don't, you know, like when there's big tragedies, right, it's like they're not really seen as big as big as they are.

141
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:39,650
Speaker 0: Like I remember, because, you know, K-pop was and such, right, I see a lot of Korean stuffs and years ago there was the seawall fairy.

142
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,090
Speaker 0: It was like a fairy with hundreds of people.

143
00:07:42,452 --> 00:07:46,610
Speaker 0: that was basically that you can look up why, but the fairy went down and a bunch of people drowned.

144
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:47,629
Speaker 0: Lots of people.

145
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,910
Speaker 0: And the population of Korea is not large.

146
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,929
Speaker 0: There are not a lot of total Korean people on Earth.

147
00:07:54,991 --> 00:07:59,110
Speaker 1: There also aren't mass deaths as often as happened in the United States.

148
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:18,588
Speaker 0: Right, a significant number of the Korean people on Earth drowned in the fairy to where it was like an enormous, enormous deal for those people, whereas if that same fairy with the same number of people had like, I don't know, sunk in Manhattan, it would be a deal.

149
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,190
Speaker 0: But we would not be talking about it still.

150
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,643
Speaker 1: It would be in the news in the U.S.

151
00:08:22,663 --> 00:08:28,826
Speaker 1: for like two days and then a month later when the follow-up like, "Oh, the driver of the thing has been

152
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:29,309
Speaker 1: charged.".

153
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,068
Speaker 0: Right, so if this, you know what, like 30-something people.

154
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:37,450
Speaker 1: 34 because people in the hospital are still dying because burn injuries are horrific.

155
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:43,023
Speaker 0: Right, so if this had not been anime-related, right, it probably wouldn't even make news in the

156
00:08:43,124 --> 00:08:43,467
Speaker 0: U.S.,

157
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,950
Speaker 0: but it would still, it's probably still, I imagine, the number one news in Japan even now.

158
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:53,067
Speaker 1: It is because this is the single largest mass murder in Japan since World War II.

159
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:58,050
Speaker 0: Right, if you probably look, it's probably the front page of every Japanese newspaper every single day.

160
00:08:58,231 --> 00:08:59,169
Speaker 1: Like, you know what this is like?

161
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,530
Speaker 1: Remember when Columbine happened in the U.S.

162
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,198
Speaker 1: This is like 9/11 big.

163
00:09:03,731 --> 00:09:04,846
Speaker 0: When Columbine happened.

164
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,128
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, what, 1000, you know, let's see.

165
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,227
Speaker 1: When the Columbine mass shooting happened in the

166
00:09:11,328 --> 00:09:11,570
Speaker 1: U.S.,

167
00:09:11,892 --> 00:09:19,990
Speaker 1: that was the only thing in the news for months because that was relatively unprecedented and it was a big deal.

168
00:09:20,312 --> 00:09:22,890
Speaker 1: Now they happen so often, they're not even talked about.

169
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:35,429
Speaker 0: Right, it's like, you know, the actual count of people dying is probably, you know, hundredths of the people that died on 9/11, but in terms of, you know, societal impact to the country, you know.

170
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:47,116
Speaker 1: But also, this will deeply affect KyoAni because if 34 people, like I work for a giant company, if 34, well we had one person in my department die a while ago.

171
00:09:47,136 --> 00:09:47,889
Speaker 0: Probably a significant person.

172
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,104
Speaker 1: Yeah, one person died out of nowhere.

173
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,141
Speaker 1: It was terribly tragic.

174
00:09:52,161 --> 00:10:00,888
Speaker 1: She died in a plane crash like out of nowhere and that actually really affected obviously psychologically, but it also affected the day-to-day business, like it affected what we're gonna do.

175
00:10:01,373 --> 00:10:02,790
Speaker 0: I had a meeting with that person tomorrow.

176
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,039
Speaker 0: Now they're not there.

177
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,090
Speaker 0: They're never gonna be there.

178
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:05,670
Speaker 1: It's actually tough.

179
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,390
Speaker 0: Whatever they knew, whatever they had to say, all their knowledge gone.

180
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:21,548
Speaker 1: What's tough is that some of the things that I had this person design for me aren't done yet, so literally today I was doing an engineering like UX review and I pulled up the screen and I just remembered, oh yeah, she designed that.

181
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,305
Speaker 1: Oof.

182
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:32,590
Speaker 0: I mean, I've only been at the place I'm working right now a little over a year and I've learned basically a whole shit ton about, you know, our business.

183
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:48,569
Speaker 0: If I got hit by a bus while I'm biking and I don't work anymore, they have to find a new developer who's as good as me and then teach them everything that it took me six months to learn about the business not to mention any software things.

184
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:54,108
Speaker 0: Then they have to learn the code that I already wrote and then that project's gonna be delayed for like, you know, right?

185
00:10:55,414 --> 00:10:57,550
Speaker 0: If 34 people, that's more than our whole department.

186
00:10:58,161 --> 00:10:59,170
Speaker 0: Our whole project would be over.

187
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,150
Speaker 0: They would have to start from nothing.

188
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,421
Speaker 1: Yup, or shut, like.

189
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:03,410
Speaker 1: that's the kind of thing that shuts down a company.

190
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,949
Speaker 0: An insurance policy would pay out to maybe save the company.

191
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:07,485
Speaker 1: Yup.

192
00:11:08,352 --> 00:11:26,920
Speaker 1: And the only other thing that's notable to say about this, and I'm not gonna say the name of the person who did it because he's just some terrorist shitbag, but it is becoming increasingly apparent that he is another one of these obsessed crazy fan types who are a very real danger to the creative

193
00:11:26,941 --> 00:11:27,564
Speaker 0: endeavors

194
00:11:28,006 --> 00:11:28,870
Speaker 1: in the world today.

195
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:40,430
Speaker 1: Crazed fans believe that the companies that make the anime titties and the video games that they like owe them something and when they don't get what they expected, they freak out and they're dangerous.

196
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:48,130
Speaker 0: We've talked about this before, you know, and it's like, what's the root cause is questionable, right?

197
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:53,070
Speaker 0: Is the toxic masculinity the root cause?

198
00:11:53,596 --> 00:11:54,750
Speaker 1: Is it the sense of entitlement?

199
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:59,990
Speaker 0: Is it some fungus, you know, like rabies or some disease like rabies that controls your brain?

200
00:12:00,031 --> 00:12:00,609
Speaker 0: 'cause those are real.

201
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:01,929
Speaker 0: I'm not even joking about that.

202
00:12:02,071 --> 00:12:03,749
Speaker 1: Yeah, I doubt it's that in these cases.

203
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:09,704
Speaker 0: Right, but I'm saying there's like lead poisoning, right, when lead went out of our gas, violence went way down in the

204
00:12:09,846 --> 00:12:09,988
Speaker 0: U.S.,

205
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:10,170
Speaker 0: right?

206
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,630
Speaker 1: Yup, and we can't say for sure.

207
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:18,730
Speaker 0: Right, the root cause of why people like this exist is unknown, but people like this have always been around, right?

208
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:23,966
Speaker 0: But there seems to be a correlation of people who are sad, right?

209
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,429
Speaker 1: Yup, isolated.

210
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,630
Speaker 0: Isolated, toxically, masculine, always men.

211
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:30,387
Speaker 0: Always men.

212
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:39,850
Speaker 0: Never women, so there must be some relation to either societal treatment of men or genetically men or both or something like that.

213
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:43,310
Speaker 1: And then hyper obsessive about a piece of popular culture.

214
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,490
Speaker 0: Well, not just a piece of, obsession with something, right?

215
00:12:46,611 --> 00:12:52,690
Speaker 0: It could be a celebrity that they stalk, it could be a person they know that they stalk, it could be a piece of artwork, right?

216
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:57,469
Speaker 0: Like they're obsessed with, you know, a catcher in the rye, like the guy who shot John Lennon.

217
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:58,282
Speaker 0: Right?

218
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:04,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, people like young kids today don't really know a lot about why John Lennon was shot.

219
00:13:04,313 --> 00:13:04,450
Speaker 1: Right.

220
00:13:04,571 --> 00:13:05,430
Speaker 1: It was stupid.

221
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:05,884
Speaker 1: Right.

222
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,329
Speaker 1: It was just as stupid as this.

223
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:12,764
Speaker 0: It could be, you know, an anime or a studio or a song or a band.

224
00:13:13,046 --> 00:13:27,029
Speaker 0: or, you know, these people who have all those other problems tend to get obsessed with a thing and then when they, if they, right, but they often do, or I guess we only, confirmation bias, we only hear about them when they do.

225
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:32,149
Speaker 0: So maybe the ones who- Well, there's another, there's gotta be some other factor on top of all these things.

226
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,890
Speaker 0: There are many people like this who I guess don't end up acting out violently.

227
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:36,060
Speaker 0: Yup.

228
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:40,510
Speaker 0: But those who do, target that thing that they're obsessed with with their violence.

229
00:13:41,052 --> 00:13:44,490
Speaker 0: It always, it looks a lot like the serial killers you see in like Hannibal movies.

230
00:13:44,750 --> 00:14:00,509
Speaker 1: Yup, but I think it's like, 'cause you know, the history of- But the history of serial killers, like it was kind of a big deal when the FBI, like in the early days of this kind of research, figured out that there's this one kind of murder that's very different from every other kind of murder we've ever seen.

231
00:14:00,954 --> 00:14:04,909
Speaker 1: And they follow a pattern and the pattern was oddly specific.

232
00:14:05,216 --> 00:14:05,367
Speaker 0: Yup.

233
00:14:05,851 --> 00:14:11,010
Speaker 1: And there is a similar, kind of like how they figured out what a sequence killer was and later they call it a serial killer.

234
00:14:11,471 --> 00:14:18,650
Speaker 1: There is a kind of dangerous person that fits a very narrow profile and the same kind of person did this crime.

235
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:22,410
Speaker 0: Right, and we see it also happening with like the crazy QAnon dude.

236
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:22,862
Speaker 0: Yup.

237
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:29,529
Speaker 1: Yeah, remember the head of the Gambino crime family was murdered by someone who thought that Donald Trump would protect him because of QAnon.

238
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,150
Speaker 1: Like, that is crackpot, batshit, crazy.

239
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:37,573
Speaker 0: It's definitely crackpot because if anything, Trump and Gambino's are like, "Yeah,

240
00:14:37,593 --> 00:14:37,797
Speaker 0: baby.".

241
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:40,646
Speaker 0: They're like best bros.

242
00:14:41,953 --> 00:14:46,569
Speaker 0: I guess, or maybe they're not best bros 'cause it could be Russian Mafia versus Italian Mafia.

243
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,147
Speaker 0: Could be.

244
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,308
Speaker 0: Maybe they're not best bros.

245
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:57,030
Speaker 1: The point is, If you were nefarious and you wanted to hurt people, you would trick the QAnon nut jobs into attacking the person you wanted to take out.

246
00:14:57,171 --> 00:14:57,610
Speaker 1: Just saying.

247
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:58,270
Speaker 0: Anyway.

248
00:14:59,072 --> 00:15:06,828
Speaker 1: So, there's not much more to say about this except that I hope the studio survives because they're doing really good work.

249
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:07,303
Speaker 1: Mmm.

250
00:15:08,393 --> 00:15:13,167
Speaker 1: In much more horrifying news 'cause I gotta make a segue out of that, the Cats trailer came out.

251
00:15:13,795 --> 00:15:15,110
Speaker 0: This is much less horrifying.

252
00:15:16,794 --> 00:15:18,330
Speaker 0: In fact, the opposite of horrifying.

253
00:15:19,796 --> 00:15:21,769
Speaker 1: The internet reacted to it pretty strongly.

254
00:15:22,934 --> 00:15:24,205
Speaker 0: it's easy to see why, right?

255
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:37,088
Speaker 0: Is that A, musicals, regardless of what you personally think of them, is sort of a cultural thing where it's sort of like funny to laugh at them and be against them.

256
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:40,188
Speaker 1: Now, I love musicals.

257
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:40,810
Speaker 0: Right.

258
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:54,270
Speaker 0: There seems to be this at least some large feeling in the general pop culture, at least in the US, that, you know, you should hate musicals or you should only like them ironically.

259
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:56,210
Speaker 1: Well, like the anti-disco movement.

260
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:59,790
Speaker 1: Like, that was a pop culture thing to make fun of disco even if you didn't care that much about disco.

261
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,110
Speaker 0: That was a racist movement, actually.

262
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:01,829
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, yeah.

263
00:16:02,876 --> 00:16:03,770
Speaker 1: I said pop culture.

264
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:04,782
Speaker 0: But anyway.

265
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:06,409
Speaker 0: Was I wrong?

266
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,589
Speaker 0: Maybe the anti-musical movement is anti-gay.

267
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:09,286
Speaker 0: Who knows?

268
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:18,250
Speaker 1: But I love musicals and I like the music from Cats but I do not like Cats as a musical.

269
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:22,449
Speaker 0: I both like musicals and Cats and the music in Cats.

270
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:31,130
Speaker 1: I like the music in Cats but I don't want to see any part of Cats except the musical pieces themselves separated from Cats the musical.

271
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:33,248
Speaker 0: Cats is not my favorite musical by any stretch.

272
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,030
Speaker 0: But if you said, "Hey, Scott.

273
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,218
Speaker 1: Cats is playing

274
00:16:36,258 --> 00:16:36,501
Speaker 1: again."

275
00:16:37,695 --> 00:16:38,930
Speaker 1: I don't need to go see Cats again.

276
00:16:39,154 --> 00:16:39,870
Speaker 0: Have some tickets.

277
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:40,957
Speaker 0: I'd be like,

278
00:16:41,018 --> 00:16:41,345
Speaker 0: "Alright."

279
00:16:41,693 --> 00:16:46,249
Speaker 0: And in fact, I would even pay a number of dollars for those tickets greater than zero.

280
00:16:46,633 --> 00:16:51,010
Speaker 1: I would go see Martin fucking Gair again before I would see Cats again.

281
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,450
Speaker 0: I thought that's your favorite shit, though.

282
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,830
Speaker 1: Martin Gair is not good.

283
00:16:55,232 --> 00:16:56,290
Speaker 0: I thought it was your favorite biz.

284
00:16:56,612 --> 00:17:01,590
Speaker 1: I like Martin Gair in the same way that I like watching a Dark Souls speedrun.

285
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:09,809
Speaker 1: Attempting to perform Martin Gair is an interesting feat unto itself and I like to watch experts struggle to do difficult things.

286
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,510
Speaker 1: But I do not- Martin Gair is not a good musical.

287
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,868
Speaker 0: I mean, there's a reason it's not really playing, anyway.

288
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:19,169
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was intended to be Les Mis 2, basically, and it did not succeed.

289
00:17:20,537 --> 00:17:21,150
Speaker 1: But I digress.

290
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,349
Speaker 0: Okay, so there's a trailer for a new Cats movie.

291
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:30,290
Speaker 0: Now, usually when things are adapted from some other medium to movie, right?

292
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:34,150
Speaker 0: Which is usually the direction most adaptations go is to movie, right?

293
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,149
Speaker 0: Rarely from movie.

294
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,189
Speaker 0: Usually, they're not so hot.

295
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,410
Speaker 0: We got some notable exceptions like Lord of the Rings, for example.

296
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,349
Speaker 0: But not The Hobbit.

297
00:17:43,914 --> 00:17:47,749
Speaker 0: Which I didn't even see past one and a half- I only watched one and a half Hobbit movies.

298
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,980
Speaker 1: And it depends, because there are 0.75 good Hobbit movies.

299
00:17:52,856 --> 00:17:54,647
Speaker 1: If you don't count the old animated ones.

300
00:17:55,873 --> 00:17:56,088
Speaker 1: Anyway.

301
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,190
Speaker 1: There are 0.75 live-action Hobbit movies.

302
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:25,109
Speaker 0: Anyway, so, the thing is, the one kind of adaptation to movie that actually has a very long history of being very successful and good is Broadway play, especially musical, but pretty much any Broadway play, even non-musical ones, any stage production, to movie, those actually, historically, tend to be great, and many of the best movies of all time were just originally plays of some kind.

303
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,210
Speaker 0: There's a great Death of the Salesman movie.

304
00:18:27,951 --> 00:18:30,348
Speaker 0: There's a great- Oh, uh, Fiddler on the Roof.

305
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,530
Speaker 0: There's a little- What else can I think?

306
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,249
Speaker 0: Cabaret, one of the best movies.

307
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,008
Speaker 0: Cabaret is a great movie.

308
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:39,009
Speaker 0: Is it Oklahoma?

309
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:39,810
Speaker 0: Wasn't that originally?

310
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:40,929
Speaker 0: That's kind of a good movie.

311
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,790
Speaker 1: Oh, I haven't seen Oklahoma since I was a little kid.

312
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:43,649
Speaker 0: Kind of a good movie.

313
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:44,509
Speaker 0: It's not bad.

314
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,569
Speaker 1: Oklahoma where the wind comes running down the ta-.

315
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,788
Speaker 0: The point is, I can go on like this for a while.

316
00:18:50,534 --> 00:18:51,664
Speaker 1: We've done a show about musicals.

317
00:18:53,058 --> 00:18:53,368
Speaker 0: Oh, did we?

318
00:18:54,058 --> 00:18:54,250
Speaker 1: Probably.

319
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,719
Speaker 1: If we didn't, there's an easy Thursday show.

320
00:18:56,431 --> 00:19:05,350
Speaker 0: Anyway, if you go to the theater with a camera, which they won't let you do, and you just record the stage play- Not good usually.

321
00:19:05,692 --> 00:19:09,190
Speaker 0: It's usually, it's rarely, rarely, rarely ever good.

322
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:18,010
Speaker 0: I actually have seen just recording of Cats on television on cable randomly when I was at my family's house, and it's aight.

323
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,750
Speaker 0: It's nowhere near being there.

324
00:19:20,194 --> 00:19:30,021
Speaker 1: It's like- And it's nowhere near if they adapted it to a movie, like say Moulin Rouge, where there's a camera that can move around and you can do multiple takes and have CG.

325
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:39,168
Speaker 0: It's worse than being in the cheapest, crappiest, obstructed view seat at the theater than watching just recording of what happened at the theater.

326
00:19:39,434 --> 00:19:39,501
Speaker 0: Yep.

327
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:40,030
Speaker 0: Right?

328
00:19:40,734 --> 00:19:50,049
Speaker 0: But when you make an actual movie with the same plot, same music, same script basically, just adapt it from a stage play to a screenplay, it tends to turn out great.

329
00:19:51,694 --> 00:19:57,169
Speaker 0: So, a cat's moving, which I already like cats, so I actually think this is gonna be great.

330
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:08,850
Speaker 1: I guess my- What the internet took issue with, which I do disagree too, is that the faces are way too human and they edge into an uncanny valley as a result.

331
00:20:08,951 --> 00:20:13,786
Speaker 0: Obviously, it would've been better if they didn't do all the CG nonsense and just had to stick people in the cat costumes.

332
00:20:14,332 --> 00:20:14,442
Speaker 1: Yeah.

333
00:20:15,012 --> 00:20:21,650
Speaker 1: Or if they doubled down on the CG nonsense and just made either actual cats, a la Lion King.

334
00:20:22,001 --> 00:20:22,088
Speaker 0: Yep.

335
00:20:22,476 --> 00:20:24,008
Speaker 1: I would've watched the hell out of that.

336
00:20:24,392 --> 00:20:36,109
Speaker 0: Or, right, the main problem here is if it looks in the trailer like what they've done, it's not as bad as the Sonic the Hedgehog movie trailer was, but it looks like they've made CG furry cat people, right?

337
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,949
Speaker 1: With non-furry human faces.

338
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:44,549
Speaker 0: That their bodies are controlled by some sort of motion capture, plus a little flair added by animators, right?

339
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,650
Speaker 0: Post, you know, whatever, right?

340
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:50,210
Speaker 0: Like, you know, whiskers twinkling and stuff you can't really do with your motion capture.

341
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:50,358
Speaker 0: Yeah.

342
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:53,949
Speaker 0: I guess you could attach some whiskers to your face, but you can't control the way a cat does, right?

343
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:56,749
Speaker 0: Or tails, for example, right?

344
00:20:57,913 --> 00:21:05,650
Speaker 0: And then, they've sort of taken people's faces, and for the face capture, it almost looks... You remember that YouTube with the annoying orange?

345
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:12,448
Speaker 0: It was like an orange, and there was like a human lip and eyes in the orange that were just like superimposed there on their own.

346
00:21:12,735 --> 00:21:13,049
Speaker 1: Yep.

347
00:21:13,497 --> 00:21:14,110
Speaker 0: It's like that.

348
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:22,910
Speaker 0: It's like they just put someone's face and just drew a lasso tool around their moving face and just pasted it onto the cat face.

349
00:21:23,173 --> 00:21:24,710
Speaker 0: And drew some whiskers on it.

350
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:31,970
Speaker 1: It should have either just been actual actors and practical effects or make them have actual fucking cat faces.

351
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,050
Speaker 1: Just go nuts with it.

352
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,330
Speaker 0: But I feel like it's one of those things.

353
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:45,100
Speaker 0: I didn't actually see it yet, but actually now, I think you can watch it on Discord stream as the more recent Battle Angel movie where people during the trailer were like, "The eyes, I'm

354
00:21:45,161 --> 00:21:45,569
Speaker 0: again!".

355
00:21:45,694 --> 00:21:45,803
Speaker 0: Right?

356
00:21:46,231 --> 00:21:52,429
Speaker 0: I haven't seen it, but I have heard from people that actually, when you watch the movie, it's not really a big problem.

357
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,349
Speaker 0: It just stands out in the trailer.

358
00:21:55,197 --> 00:22:05,367
Speaker 0: So I feel, I'm not saying I guarantee this, but I just feel that when you watch this Cats movie that the weird faces, I think you will possibly get over them.

359
00:22:06,135 --> 00:22:09,608
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's hard to say because Cats is kind of long and boring.

360
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,890
Speaker 0: Cats is, I mean, long is a good thing.

361
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,428
Speaker 0: You want more for your money and boring, no.

362
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:19,490
Speaker 1: You want longer, more for your money, watch the full Jekyll and Hyde.

363
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:20,309
Speaker 0: Alright.

364
00:22:21,321 --> 00:22:21,490
Speaker 0: Sure.

365
00:22:21,691 --> 00:22:22,108
Speaker 0: Sounds good.

366
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:27,489
Speaker 0: There's actually, what was that one that's like a, there was a Harry Potter one that was recent.

367
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:28,450
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's still going.

368
00:22:28,854 --> 00:22:29,050
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

369
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:31,170
Speaker 0: You have to go on two different days.

370
00:22:31,431 --> 00:22:32,970
Speaker 0: It's like a two show deal.

371
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,208
Speaker 0: You gotta come on two days.

372
00:22:35,473 --> 00:22:37,369
Speaker 0: Like part one on one day, or part two on another day.

373
00:22:37,751 --> 00:22:39,470
Speaker 1: I think someone on Twitter said it best.

374
00:22:39,972 --> 00:22:42,010
Speaker 0: another play that did the same thing, where it's two part.

375
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:46,009
Speaker 1: Instead of making the photorealistic Lion King that does not look good.

376
00:22:46,251 --> 00:22:47,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Lion King one apparently is awful.

377
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:48,423
Speaker 0: I don't know why.

378
00:22:48,444 --> 00:22:48,846
Speaker 0: they, you know.

379
00:22:49,071 --> 00:22:53,270
Speaker 1: I think they should have made the Lion King like this, and they should have made Cats Like the Lion King.

380
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,470
Speaker 1: I think those would have made, it would have made two better movies.

381
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,390
Speaker 0: I think they should just go back to hand drawn animation.

382
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:00,138
Speaker 1: Yeah.

383
00:23:01,637 --> 00:23:07,970
Speaker 1: I feel like these, it's funny how even mainstream media sites are calling that the live action Lion King.

384
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:08,481
Speaker 0: Right.

385
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:13,930
Speaker 1: But I feel like those movies are just aimed at the international generic audience.

386
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,130
Speaker 0: Just about any movie is aimed at the international audience.

387
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:18,441
Speaker 0: You don't make enough money by putting just a movie in U.S.

388
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:18,750
Speaker 0: theaters.

389
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:33,599
Speaker 1: So I got a brief pseudo geek bite, because when we judged anime by its cover most recently, one of the shows we talked about that looked really good, but then when we looked at what it was about, we decided it probably wasn't that good, was Fire Force, which

390
00:23:33,923 --> 00:23:34,025
Speaker 0: was

391
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:34,470
Speaker 1: Fire Fighters.

392
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:39,008
Speaker 0: Was the Japanese name of it, because we didn't say Fire Force when we... Anano Shobutai?

393
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:43,307
Speaker 0: Yeah, we didn't judge it according to the... AnnieChart.net likes to use Japanese names.

394
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:43,920
Speaker 1: Yeah.

395
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,849
Speaker 1: But we knew it was the fireman anime.

396
00:23:45,931 --> 00:23:48,589
Speaker 0: Yeah, because the image we saw had Fire Fighters in it.

397
00:23:48,771 --> 00:23:53,848
Speaker 1: And it looked really aesthetic, but then when we looked at what it was about, it's got a bunch of proper nouns.

398
00:23:53,951 --> 00:23:55,830
Speaker 0: It looks just like a shonen action fight.

399
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,010
Speaker 1: And it's by the Soul Eater.

400
00:23:57,391 --> 00:23:58,509
Speaker 1: It's by the Soul Eater guy.

401
00:23:58,790 --> 00:23:59,770
Speaker 0: It's going to be Soul Eater.

402
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:05,290
Speaker 0: Fight the supernatural force shonen show, but everyone, it looks like Fire Fighters.

403
00:24:05,714 --> 00:24:05,786
Speaker 1: Yup.

404
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:11,949
Speaker 1: And my main worry about this show was that it's going to be a dumb shonen fighting show.

405
00:24:12,472 --> 00:24:16,789
Speaker 1: A lot of people are trying to tell me this is not the case, and that is legitimately good.

406
00:24:17,112 --> 00:24:18,529
Speaker 0: Well, do those people like Soul Eater?

407
00:24:18,951 --> 00:24:21,545
Speaker 1: So, here's my new worry about Fire Force.

408
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:22,706
Speaker 1: Did you watch Fire Force?

409
00:24:22,932 --> 00:24:23,269
Speaker 1: Not yet, no.

410
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:24,350
Speaker 0: geek biting it?

411
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:25,627
Speaker 1: No, I said it's a pre-geek bite.

412
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:26,950
Speaker 0: Pre-geek bite.

413
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:27,610
Speaker 0: It's the geek.

414
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:28,450
Speaker 0: He already did that.

415
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:29,988
Speaker 0: It was called Judge Anime by his cover.

416
00:24:30,672 --> 00:24:32,350
Speaker 1: So here's my thinking on this now.

417
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,109
Speaker 0: Oh my god, this is all rim.

418
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:33,930
Speaker 0: I got nothing to do with this.

419
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,050
Speaker 1: So all I'm saying is, my worry about this show now...

420
00:24:36,112 --> 00:24:37,428
Speaker 0: Whenever I judge, it still stands.

421
00:24:37,913 --> 00:24:40,589
Speaker 1: My worry about this show, I have a more nuanced judge because I took a bite.

422
00:24:41,096 --> 00:24:41,221
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

423
00:24:41,956 --> 00:24:50,029
Speaker 1: My worry is that... Remember how Noir felt like it was going to be the greatest anime ever, and then nine or ten episodes in, we realized the music had just tricked us?

424
00:24:50,311 --> 00:24:52,890
Speaker 1: I worry that Fire Force is the same thing.

425
00:24:52,970 --> 00:25:00,868
Speaker 1: The people who are saying it's good have been tricked by the amazing aesthetics, and in eight or nine episodes, they're going to realize it's just Soul Eater.

426
00:25:01,854 --> 00:25:02,000
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

427
00:25:02,853 --> 00:25:03,229
Speaker 0: All right.

428
00:25:03,593 --> 00:25:04,530
Speaker 1: So what do you got to geek bite?

429
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:20,067
Speaker 0: So, you know, I've been buying a lot less comic books lately because I've been reading a lot less comic books and waiting for more trades, and there's, you know, there's a lot less... It's like Saga is on hiatus, for example, right?

430
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:29,429
Speaker 0: You know, and it's... There seemed to be this thing where there was a wave when I started buying comic books in the Beacon days where it's like, aha, I'm out of college and I have a job.

431
00:25:29,552 --> 00:25:30,530
Speaker 0: I can buy comic books now.

432
00:25:30,995 --> 00:25:34,129
Speaker 0: So I bought all the great comic books of history that I had never read.

433
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,969
Speaker 1: And between the two of us, we have a large pile of comics.

434
00:25:37,391 --> 00:25:43,710
Speaker 0: And then over time, great series, I got them all and they were done, or things stopped, right?

435
00:25:43,952 --> 00:25:48,790
Speaker 0: And the number of new things that came out, because I was buying decades worth of great stuff, right?

436
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:54,009
Speaker 0: The rate at which new stuff came out that I was going to read and also the rate of me reading stuff.

437
00:25:54,794 --> 00:25:55,543
Speaker 0: It was down, right?

438
00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:02,389
Speaker 1: Of all the complete manga I've bought up there, I think Here Is Greenwood is the only one I actually read all of.

439
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:05,549
Speaker 0: Then there's like a wave where it's like, all right, you got all these American comics.

440
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:10,469
Speaker 0: Well, now we're going to publish all these great mangas of history that you never had, like all these Tezukas and stuff.

441
00:26:10,751 --> 00:26:11,909
Speaker 0: So I was buying all that.

442
00:26:12,315 --> 00:26:14,490
Speaker 0: And then that wave has now sort of crashed.

443
00:26:14,713 --> 00:26:21,108
Speaker 0: And now there's only like a trickle of new comic books that I have time to read and want to read and I'm willing to pay to read.

444
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:29,509
Speaker 1: And there's even a worst piece there for me in particular in that other than comics, I do not consume anything else with physical media.

445
00:26:29,975 --> 00:26:30,870
Speaker 1: Like anything.

446
00:26:31,531 --> 00:26:32,230
Speaker 1: Anime, books, nothing.

447
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:32,520
Speaker 0: Yep.

448
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:40,087
Speaker 0: I would get digital comics if, A, I could get all the ones that I want, in the format I want, and they weren't meh.

449
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:42,970
Speaker 1: And B, like the reading experience is still like not quite there.

450
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:43,548
Speaker 0: It's not there.

451
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:48,187
Speaker 0: Anyway, there are some things like comics I can read digitally, like if they were meant to, like a webcomic.

452
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:48,480
Speaker 0: Yeah.

453
00:26:48,912 --> 00:26:54,750
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is, I recently went to the beach, I had some reading time.

454
00:26:55,130 --> 00:27:02,449
Speaker 0: I've been trying to read the comics I have because there's quite a few comics I have that are in a pile known as read and then get rid of to clean up shelf space.

455
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,330
Speaker 0: Then there's read and keep forever.

456
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:18,090
Speaker 0: But anyway, one of the ones I did not read, but is a read and keep forever one, obviously, is Lone Wolf and Cub by Kazuo Koike, because originally, people don't know, it was published by Dark Horse in these tiny weird shaped volumes.

457
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,487
Speaker 1: I remember, I'd always see them.

458
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,770
Speaker 1: I always wanted them, but I didn't have money.

459
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:28,489
Speaker 0: You can get these at discount bins at like any convention, and there were like tons of them, and in order to get the full set of the manga, you had to buy a lot of these little tiny volumes.

460
00:27:28,892 --> 00:27:34,168
Speaker 0: So I started collecting them at one point, but I didn't want to start reading until I had them all, just in case, right?

461
00:27:35,513 --> 00:27:37,868
Speaker 0: And then before I could get them all, "You know what?

462
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:42,216
Speaker 0: We're going to reprint it in these big volumes that are not only larger in page

463
00:27:42,236 --> 00:27:42,336
Speaker 0: size.".

464
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,729
Speaker 0: See, the art is better, easier to see.

465
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,329
Speaker 0: Not these little tiny bookies.

466
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,970
Speaker 1: Because you're reading Kazuo Koike, you got to appreciate that art.

467
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,170
Speaker 0: Well, he's not the artist.

468
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,450
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, but his subject matter.

469
00:27:54,750 --> 00:28:04,049
Speaker 0: Anyway, but also each volume was actually like three, I think three smaller ones combined into a single volume, like these omnibus editions.

470
00:28:04,593 --> 00:28:07,609
Speaker 0: So I could buy much fewer total books and get all of it.

471
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,070
Speaker 0: So that was quite a while ago.

472
00:28:09,151 --> 00:28:10,709
Speaker 0: I bought those as they published them.

473
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:12,188
Speaker 1: And you still got the little ones?

474
00:28:12,713 --> 00:28:13,489
Speaker 0: No, I got rid of the little ones.

475
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:14,269
Speaker 1: Okay, get rid of them all.

476
00:28:15,255 --> 00:28:18,410
Speaker 0: I have all of Lone Wolf and Cub in larger editions.

477
00:28:19,634 --> 00:28:20,910
Speaker 0: So I finally got around to reading it.

478
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:27,570
Speaker 0: I've read two and a half large books, which is about, I'd say, seven to eight small books' worth.

479
00:28:29,837 --> 00:28:33,710
Speaker 0: And I mean, everyone says it's like a masterpiece, all time great manga.

480
00:28:33,954 --> 00:28:34,708
Speaker 0: And they ain't lying.

481
00:28:35,516 --> 00:28:35,750
Speaker 0: All right.

482
00:28:36,611 --> 00:28:38,609
Speaker 1: So lay those omnibuses on me.

483
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:45,489
Speaker 0: If you, you know, if you're the kind of person who watches like samurai movies, you know, like some Akira Kurosawa and such.

484
00:28:46,261 --> 00:28:46,490
Speaker 0: Right.

485
00:28:46,815 --> 00:28:50,829
Speaker 0: And you're like, man, I've seen like every samurai movie, great samurai movie there is.

486
00:28:51,331 --> 00:28:56,130
Speaker 0: You know, I sure would like more samurai tales because they're really great.

487
00:28:56,453 --> 00:28:57,369
Speaker 0: Well, here you go.

488
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:00,530
Speaker 0: This one is like way better than most.

489
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:06,290
Speaker 0: I'm sure you can still get it quite easily, maybe even digitally in English.

490
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,107
Speaker 0: Why wouldn't you?

491
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:10,347
Speaker 0: The only negative thing I can say is that it is still flippid.

492
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:12,588
Speaker 0: It is left to right.

493
00:29:14,391 --> 00:29:21,930
Speaker 0: And also they leave a lot of words like Romanized, but still the Japanese word, they even warn you about it.

494
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,028
Speaker 0: They intentionally do it.

495
00:29:23,472 --> 00:29:34,148
Speaker 0: And I can see why, because the words they leave are words that have a meaning that is so complicated that you couldn't put enough words in the tiny, tiny bubbles that this comic has.

496
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,750
Speaker 1: All according to Keikaku.

497
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:36,510
Speaker 0: Right.

498
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:37,929
Speaker 0: Not like that.

499
00:29:38,371 --> 00:29:46,889
Speaker 0: But, you know, they're usually words, you know, because I imagine that it's an older style of Japanese language from the olden times.

500
00:29:48,932 --> 00:30:03,110
Speaker 0: And also the other thing they do that is slightly meh in the translation, which I guess is a thing that a lot of people have done, which is, you know, when people in the, you know, at least if you know about anime and manga, you're a seasoned anime manga connoisseur.

501
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:11,190
Speaker 0: That when someone's speaking in like different dialects of Japan, they just translate it to different accents of America.

502
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,210
Speaker 0: So it's like someone's talking in a Southern way.

503
00:30:13,593 --> 00:30:15,529
Speaker 0: Oh, they must be from Osaka or whatever.

504
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:16,001
Speaker 0: Right.

505
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:16,825
Speaker 0: Whatever it is.

506
00:30:17,432 --> 00:30:19,890
Speaker 0: So they do that thing a lot as well.

507
00:30:20,155 --> 00:30:20,849
Speaker 0: That stands out.

508
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:23,366
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's basically, you know, Lone Wolf and Cub.

509
00:30:23,591 --> 00:30:27,009
Speaker 0: If you don't know anything about it, it's about this badass dude.

510
00:30:27,511 --> 00:30:28,890
Speaker 0: His background is mysterious.

511
00:30:29,473 --> 00:30:32,430
Speaker 0: He's like the best god tier swordsman there is.

512
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,230
Speaker 0: He's an assassin.

513
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:38,650
Speaker 0: You can hire him for 500 Rio, which is a lot of fucking money and he'll kill whoever you want to kill.

514
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:47,748
Speaker 0: And his only condition is that you tell him the truth, like the whole story, like, you know, I need you to kill this person because X, Y, and Z. And then he does it.

515
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,109
Speaker 0: You better not lie to him.

516
00:30:49,451 --> 00:30:50,429
Speaker 0: No, that would be a bad idea.

517
00:30:51,273 --> 00:30:52,870
Speaker 0: But yeah, he's, he's just god tier.

518
00:30:53,091 --> 00:30:56,290
Speaker 0: And he has a son, a little like, you know, three year old kid.

519
00:30:56,633 --> 00:31:00,165
Speaker 0: He pushes the kid around in a little carriage, which has weapons built into it.

520
00:31:01,615 --> 00:31:01,929
Speaker 1: Spoilers.

521
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,230
Speaker 0: That's not spoilers.

522
00:31:05,713 --> 00:31:13,507
Speaker 0: And yeah, the kid is also a super dangerous badass because his whole life has been going around with his assassin dad watching his assassin dad chop people up.

523
00:31:14,755 --> 00:31:15,590
Speaker 1: I'm just thinking about your crew.

524
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,390
Speaker 1: I'm already now the rabbit in the lion's den.

525
00:31:17,513 --> 00:31:21,610
Speaker 0: That's actually a good, that's actually an example of a word they don't translate.

526
00:31:21,711 --> 00:31:24,890
Speaker 0: is he's always talking about like, I travel the path of Meifumado.

527
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:27,270
Speaker 0: I don't actually know how to pronounce it or if I'm saying it right.

528
00:31:27,631 --> 00:31:31,850
Speaker 0: But basically it's the word for the Buddhist hell equivalent, right?

529
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,050
Speaker 0: That's the road he travels.

530
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:37,828
Speaker 0: So you couldn't really, it would be weird if it was like, I travel the road of Buddhist hell all the time.

531
00:31:38,512 --> 00:31:42,830
Speaker 1: And you could translate it as just the road to hell, but in the US that has different connotations.

532
00:31:43,191 --> 00:31:44,970
Speaker 0: It's not, if they could say Jigoku.

533
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:49,088
Speaker 0: I happen to know the Japanese word for hell is Jigoku because that's one of my favorite Japanese words.

534
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:51,408
Speaker 0: But Jigoku.

535
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:54,130
Speaker 1: Plus it comes up a lot in Eccentric Family with the thin golden thread.

536
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:56,230
Speaker 0: It comes up a lot in anime and manga in general.

537
00:31:56,413 --> 00:31:57,510
Speaker 1: Jipu no Jigoku.

538
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,136
Speaker 0: Japanese word of the day.

539
00:31:59,297 --> 00:31:59,980
Speaker 0: Jigoku.

540
00:32:00,061 --> 00:32:01,950
Speaker 0: J-I-G-O-K-U.

541
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:02,829
Speaker 0: It means hell.

542
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:11,089
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is, if he said I walked the path of Jigoku that would not have the same meaning at all.

543
00:32:11,351 --> 00:32:12,669
Speaker 0: It's completely different, right?

544
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,209
Speaker 0: So there you go.

545
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:17,930
Speaker 0: This is your, I guess, reminder to read Lone Wolf and Cub.

546
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:23,587
Speaker 0: If it's, you know, it's a thing you probably know, haven't thought about, maybe you've read it, maybe you haven't.

547
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:24,810
Speaker 0: If you haven't, correct yourself.

548
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:32,490
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

549
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:36,350
Speaker 1: So I'm a big fan of optical illusions because they're neat.

550
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:37,166
Speaker 1: Some of them.

551
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:44,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they're neat especially when they illustrate something weird about how the human brain processes visual information.

552
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:50,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are some optical illusions where it's like no one ever explains them really.

553
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:58,870
Speaker 0: And it's just sort of like, you know, it could be a trick of the light as opposed to it, but the ones that are a trick of the brain that are explained are the best ones.

554
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:05,210
Speaker 0: Because it's not the illusion, because once you're an adult the illusion itself doesn't really fascinate you anymore unless you're a jaded adult.

555
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:12,290
Speaker 1: But more like this illusion works because your brain processes simple information faster than it processes complex information.

556
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,108
Speaker 0: Right, stuff like that.

557
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,629
Speaker 1: Like that is the mind-bending stuff.

558
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,526
Speaker 0: Oh my god, it's not red.

559
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,390
Speaker 0: You're seeing green, but it's red.

560
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:22,890
Speaker 1: Yep, your brain is making shit up because that's what it does.

561
00:33:23,471 --> 00:33:29,950
Speaker 1: And this particular Twitter account just happens to, I'm just going to read the description.

562
00:33:30,491 --> 00:33:36,384
Speaker 1: "I am an experimental psychologist who studies visual illusions as well as makes illusion

563
00:33:36,525 --> 00:33:37,009
Speaker 1: artworks.".

564
00:33:37,402 --> 00:33:37,530
Speaker 0: Nice.

565
00:33:38,311 --> 00:33:39,702
Speaker 1: And the account is just that.

566
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:40,610
Speaker 1: It's amazing.

567
00:33:41,712 --> 00:33:47,484
Speaker 1: One of these really blew my mind because I was unaware of it and it's one, I'm not going to...

568
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,269
Speaker 0: Is it the one where you stare at the dot?

569
00:33:49,553 --> 00:33:49,725
Speaker 1: No.

570
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:51,030
Speaker 0: Is that magic eye?

571
00:33:51,411 --> 00:34:06,649
Speaker 1: It's the one about complexity of information where there's this image and if you move your head or move the image, parts of it will move faster than other parts because your brain literally takes longer to process the more complex part of the image.

572
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:11,290
Speaker 1: So your brain is showing you the simpler information faster.

573
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:17,570
Speaker 0: Isn't it interesting how video codecs have the same issues with complex parts of the image versus simple parts of the image?

574
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:27,668
Speaker 1: Yep, like all the contrast of a black gradient gets really messed up and bad if there's complex motion in the foreground for a little bit, stuff like that.

575
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:39,909
Speaker 1: That's also, you know, fun fact, if you're too young to know, when MP3s came out, the reason why MP3s were a big deal was that they encoded audio in a way that got rid of a ton of information

576
00:34:40,513 --> 00:34:40,734
Speaker 0: that

577
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:47,650
Speaker 1: the human brain did not need that information to reconstruct the sound for your conscious understanding.

578
00:34:48,733 --> 00:34:49,389
Speaker 1: So what do you got?

579
00:34:49,793 --> 00:35:00,529
Speaker 0: So, a long time ago, I did a thing of the day where there was some, you know, '50s kind of game show or something, right, where they had to guess, like, something about this old man.

580
00:35:01,113 --> 00:35:02,269
Speaker 1: Oh, that was a really good one.

581
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:11,564
Speaker 0: And it turned out that the old man, you know, this was in the '50s, 1950-something, so when my parents were alive, even though they were just, like, zero, they were less than 10, right?

582
00:35:14,172 --> 00:35:16,749
Speaker 1: The New York City subway had already been around for 50 years.

583
00:35:16,951 --> 00:35:17,192
Speaker 1: Right.

584
00:35:17,474 --> 00:35:24,010
Speaker 0: But there was a man on the game show who had been a child and was in Ford's Theatre when Lincoln was assassinated, right?

585
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:27,910
Speaker 0: And it was like, damn, that person was alive in 1950-something as an old man.

586
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,761
Speaker 1: That person was alive to be on TV.

587
00:35:30,023 --> 00:35:30,325
Speaker 1: Like, whoa.

588
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,658
Speaker 0: So here is television for 1953, I think?

589
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:35,996
Speaker 1: October 18th, 1950.

590
00:35:35,996 --> 00:35:37,830
Speaker 0: Oh, they got the exact date.

591
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,709
Speaker 1: I didn't even notice because I didn't watch the whole thing.

592
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:40,650
Speaker 1: With commercials.

593
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:41,351
Speaker 0: Yes.

594
00:35:42,294 --> 00:35:47,595
Speaker 0: So this appears to be a TV show, sort of a game show, but not really.

595
00:35:47,615 --> 00:35:52,422
Speaker 0: I guess it is a game show to some extent, called What's My Line?

596
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:53,129
Speaker 0: You may have heard of it.

597
00:35:53,471 --> 00:35:55,910
Speaker 0: And I've heard of it, but I never actually knew how the show went.

598
00:35:56,070 --> 00:36:00,149
Speaker 0: The way the show goes is there's a panel of -- everyone on the show is white.

599
00:36:01,654 --> 00:36:02,327
Speaker 1: It's the '50s.

600
00:36:02,891 --> 00:36:03,706
Speaker 0: There are women on the show.

601
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:07,569
Speaker 0: Celebrity comedy guests on the show.

602
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:14,129
Speaker 0: At least, you know, they weren't major celebrities because I haven't heard of them, but they were celebrities of the time of some nature, right?

603
00:36:15,651 --> 00:36:19,512
Speaker 0: And they were comedian, funny people, writers, that sort of thing, right?

604
00:36:19,532 --> 00:36:20,929
Speaker 0: Colonists, those sorts of people.

605
00:36:21,532 --> 00:36:30,910
Speaker 0: And they would bring someone on the show, just a random person, and they would be trying to guess, sort of like a 20-questions thing, what the person's job was, right?

606
00:36:31,612 --> 00:36:42,749
Speaker 0: And one of the men, for example, who appears on the show, the more questions the people have to ask, I think the more prize and money the contestant, the person with the job gets, right?

607
00:36:44,492 --> 00:36:47,669
Speaker 0: So one of the men was like a bathtub salesman, right?

608
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:51,110
Speaker 0: So they're asking questions like, "Oh, is this a thing?

609
00:36:52,491 --> 00:36:54,790
Speaker 0: Does your work involve any sort of product?

610
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,028
Speaker 0: Is it something that I would use?

611
00:36:57,451 --> 00:36:58,789
Speaker 0: Is it something I would use in the home?

612
00:36:59,171 --> 00:37:01,042
Speaker 0: Is it something I would use in my

613
00:37:01,203 --> 00:37:01,646
Speaker 0: bathroom?".

614
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:02,634
Speaker 0: Right?

615
00:37:02,736 --> 00:37:03,444
Speaker 0: It's like, "Yes, you

616
00:37:03,464 --> 00:37:03,646
Speaker 0: might.".

617
00:37:04,111 --> 00:37:05,860
Speaker 0: "Would women use it or men use

618
00:37:05,981 --> 00:37:06,081
Speaker 0: it?".

619
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:16,210
Speaker 0: They ask these kinds of questions, and he's a bathtub salesman, so he answers truthfully, but the answer ends up being funny, and it's a funny show to watch, right?

620
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:22,930
Speaker 0: So in this particular episode, well, I think in a lot of the episodes, they have a true celebrity appear.

621
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:32,423
Speaker 0: They blindfold the panel, and they have the host answer the questions for the celebrity, because otherwise you can guess by voice who it was.

622
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:39,607
Speaker 1: Like if it was Barack Obama in the modern era, and you heard the voice, you'd be like, "That's Barack

623
00:37:39,647 --> 00:37:40,070
Speaker 1: Obama!".

624
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,414
Speaker 0: Yeah, you'd be like, "Do you work in

625
00:37:41,454 --> 00:37:42,518
Speaker 0: manufacturing?".

626
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:46,592
Speaker 0: "No.".

627
00:37:46,794 --> 00:37:47,539
Speaker 0: "Oh, you're Obama.

628
00:37:48,344 --> 00:37:48,465
Speaker 0: It's

629
00:37:48,526 --> 00:37:48,989
Speaker 0: Obama.".

630
00:37:49,632 --> 00:37:50,918
Speaker 1: Obama would say, "Welp,".

631
00:37:51,179 --> 00:37:51,902
Speaker 1: and then you'd be like, "Okay, Mr.

632
00:37:52,023 --> 00:37:52,304
Speaker 1: Obama.".

633
00:37:53,831 --> 00:37:54,954
Speaker 0: Right.

634
00:37:55,134 --> 00:38:04,650
Speaker 0: But here on this episode, which it's crazy that this is on YouTube, someone managed to save the recording of this, because it seems like it was live television.

635
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:10,270
Speaker 0: Eleanor Roosevelt was the celebrity person that they had to guess.

636
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:11,390
Speaker 1: That is amazing.

637
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:16,957
Speaker 0: That's really amazing, and also, the reason I think it's live television is because they only have one ad.

638
00:38:16,977 --> 00:38:19,350
Speaker 0: It's for Remington Electric Razors.

639
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:24,905
Speaker 1: Well, because the show is called on the marquee, like while they're doing the show, "Remington Razors

640
00:38:25,045 --> 00:38:25,649
Speaker 1: present.".

641
00:38:25,972 --> 00:38:26,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

642
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,145
Speaker 1: Or "Remington Electric Shavers

643
00:38:28,226 --> 00:38:28,550
Speaker 1: present.".

644
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,930
Speaker 0: Yes, they're constantly, it's the only thing they advertise.

645
00:38:31,412 --> 00:38:37,928
Speaker 0: They talk about it constantly, and I think even there's this little board that shows the prize that he's counting up with, has a picture of an electric razor on it.

646
00:38:39,811 --> 00:38:42,190
Speaker 1: I'd almost rather go back to this kind of advertising.

647
00:38:42,811 --> 00:38:43,999
Speaker 0: I mean, it's honest advertising.

648
00:38:44,019 --> 00:38:45,830
Speaker 0: It's the kind of advertising you guys would do.

649
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,810
Speaker 0: We're like, "Yeah, buy this piece of crap.

650
00:38:48,211 --> 00:38:50,844
Speaker 0: This piece of crap is paying us to make this show.

651
00:38:50,924 --> 00:38:51,527
Speaker 0: Don't buy

652
00:38:51,628 --> 00:38:51,668
Speaker 0: it.".

653
00:38:54,013 --> 00:38:57,884
Speaker 0: In fact, at one point, one of the guests is like, "Oh, you sell electric razors?

654
00:38:57,904 --> 00:38:58,570
Speaker 0: Is that what they're doing?

655
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:00,318
Speaker 0: You in the razor business, maybe?

656
00:39:00,398 --> 00:39:01,725
Speaker 0: Is Remington making

657
00:39:01,745 --> 00:39:01,785
Speaker 0: it?".

658
00:39:02,931 --> 00:39:06,250
Speaker 0: They incorporate the ad into the, you know, anyway.

659
00:39:07,513 --> 00:39:12,950
Speaker 0: It's a good way to spend 20 to 30 minutes a year, and I think it's live TV because they have to hurry to the end of the show.

660
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:13,259
Speaker 0: Yeah.

661
00:39:14,277 --> 00:39:15,010
Speaker 0: It's not a recording.

662
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:21,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, also live TV was still relatively in its infancy in terms of how to produce television.

663
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:23,149
Speaker 0: Well, they invented live TV before recorded TV.

664
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:34,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the trouble was live TV, producing that with the limited time schedules and everything was very difficult, and they didn't have a lot of the modern techniques that we use in production today.

665
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:41,369
Speaker 1: So, in the moment, the Geek Night's Book Club book is the first, well, not book, but the first novel.

666
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:42,008
Speaker 0: Yep.

667
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:44,110
Speaker 1: The Tale of Genji.

668
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:51,470
Speaker 0: The first novel ever written by human beings that we still have and know about and is in recorded history and such.

669
00:39:52,352 --> 00:39:52,695
Speaker 1: Yep.

670
00:39:52,815 --> 00:39:59,170
Speaker 1: Click on the link to make sure you get the right translation because that's the one we're talking about, and it is the fully unabridged one.

671
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:06,790
Speaker 1: Geek Nights, if we're about anything, if you had to define a thing that defines Geek Nights, it is that we use the unabridged versions of things.

672
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:08,349
Speaker 0: Geek Nights is never abridged.

673
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:12,470
Speaker 1: Except with the original Gundam, maybe we would just talk about the compilation movies.

674
00:40:12,691 --> 00:40:13,006
Speaker 0: Eh, whatever.

675
00:40:13,691 --> 00:40:16,689
Speaker 0: But I am reading a different book right now.

676
00:40:17,311 --> 00:40:19,050
Speaker 1: I am also reading a different book right now.

677
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:22,590
Speaker 0: This book, The Tale of Genji, is a long book, so...

678
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:23,728
Speaker 1: It'll take us a little while.

679
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:29,244
Speaker 0: I mean, this book club will be in a while, but not like the ones in the past.

680
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:31,849
Speaker 0: We've delayed a long time because we didn't read.

681
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,630
Speaker 1: It'll actually take us a while to read it.

682
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,860
Speaker 0: It'll take us a while to get to it and then read it.

683
00:40:36,991 --> 00:40:42,650
Speaker 0: But yeah, my reading, not playing games on my phone plan continues, and I always open Kindle app.

684
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:44,450
Speaker 0: I think I might just delete all games from my phone.

685
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:44,831
Speaker 1: Yep.

686
00:40:45,717 --> 00:40:47,670
Speaker 1: I'm keeping one emergency game on my phone.

687
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:48,722
Speaker 1: Of course.

688
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:50,987
Speaker 0: Nuroshima Hex.

689
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:52,587
Speaker 1: Nuroshima Hex.

690
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:56,630
Speaker 1: I play that game 100% perfectly, as far as I can tell.

691
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:57,216
Speaker 1: When?

692
00:40:58,292 --> 00:40:59,409
Speaker 1: How am I not on top of this?

693
00:41:00,113 --> 00:41:00,749
Speaker 0: What do they add?

694
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:01,709
Speaker 0: I think they added new dudes.

695
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:02,410
Speaker 1: Are you sure?

696
00:41:02,531 --> 00:41:03,810
Speaker 0: I haven't used it in a while, but I've heard.

697
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,790
Speaker 1: I gotta check right now before we get to the main bit.

698
00:41:05,976 --> 00:41:06,126
Speaker 1: Okay.

699
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:11,490
Speaker 1: Because I would be surprised if there are new dudes in Nuroshima Hex 3.0.

700
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:12,350
Speaker 0: Well, that's the board game.

701
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:12,760
Speaker 1: Yeah.

702
00:41:13,273 --> 00:41:13,530
Speaker 0: I don't know.

703
00:41:13,811 --> 00:41:15,964
Speaker 0: I think they've added new dudes to the digital edition.

704
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:17,643
Speaker 0: I'm not 100% sure, though.

705
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,670
Speaker 1: Because I know of a lot of factions.

706
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:20,214
Speaker 0: I'm like 75% sure.

707
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:23,970
Speaker 1: Alright, I've found some recent things.

708
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:24,393
Speaker 1: Whoa!

709
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:26,810
Speaker 1: No, those are unofficial fan armies.

710
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:27,407
Speaker 1: Those don't count.

711
00:41:29,533 --> 00:41:31,510
Speaker 1: Oh, there's a revised Doomsday Machine.

712
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:33,869
Speaker 1: There's Mephisto.

713
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,505
Speaker 1: That's new.

714
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:37,690
Speaker 1: And there's Uranopolis.

715
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:38,666
Speaker 1: So, piss town?

716
00:41:40,371 --> 00:41:42,930
Speaker 1: Strong robots requiring a power supply.

717
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:43,690
Speaker 0: Oh, interesting.

718
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:46,990
Speaker 1: Alright, so they redid Doom Machine because it sucked, I guess.

719
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:47,650
Speaker 0: It really sucked.

720
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:48,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, it did suck.

721
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:49,289
Speaker 0: Wasn't it the reflecting one?

722
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:50,124
Speaker 1: Mephisto.

723
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:50,968
Speaker 1: No unit.

724
00:41:51,491 --> 00:41:53,589
Speaker 1: Just modules enhancing an alien HQ.

725
00:41:54,693 --> 00:41:55,450
Speaker 1: And Uranopolis.

726
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:56,288
Speaker 1: The robots.

727
00:41:56,692 --> 00:41:56,782
Speaker 1: Okay.

728
00:41:57,711 --> 00:42:00,250
Speaker 1: Those are two, two and a half new factions.

729
00:42:00,835 --> 00:42:01,568
Speaker 1: As far as I can tell.

730
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:02,290
Speaker 1: Alright.

731
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:03,487
Speaker 1: I did not know that.

732
00:42:03,891 --> 00:42:06,590
Speaker 1: That'll get me like another month's worth of enjoyment out of that game.

733
00:42:07,732 --> 00:42:09,390
Speaker 1: And otherwise, stay tuned.

734
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:11,349
Speaker 1: We will be live at PEX WEST.

735
00:42:12,134 --> 00:42:12,728
Speaker 1: The mothership.

736
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:13,648
Speaker 1: The real PEX.

737
00:42:13,833 --> 00:42:14,026
Speaker 1: Yes.

738
00:42:14,412 --> 00:42:17,390
Speaker 1: We will be doing panels on Friday and Saturday.

739
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:18,450
Speaker 0: Lame panels.

740
00:42:18,531 --> 00:42:19,169
Speaker 0: You can skip.

741
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,910
Speaker 0: But please come to them so I can keep getting free badges.

742
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:26,270
Speaker 0: But actually I'm not worried about that because they give us two panels at the PEX.

743
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:27,088
Speaker 0: They must be desperate.

744
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:32,430
Speaker 1: Well, also notice they're in the Hyatt and it's counter-programming to other big events.

745
00:42:33,071 --> 00:42:44,169
Speaker 1: And based on some other things I've seen about the schedule and based on the worry about the security line situation in the main convention center, they really need to get more people to go over to the Hyatt during peak times.

746
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:49,490
Speaker 1: And both of our panels are in the Hyatt counter-programmed against other big events.

747
00:42:50,490 --> 00:43:00,370
Speaker 1: So, and the title, these are panels that if you're a Geek Nights listener, you do not need to go to these panels because you know what we're going to say.

748
00:43:01,151 --> 00:43:06,350
Speaker 1: This is the kind of panel where someone will see the 40 games you must play.

749
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:07,849
Speaker 1: Ooh, I'm excited.

750
00:43:08,292 --> 00:43:12,649
Speaker 1: And then they're going to get tricked and it's going to be Raymond Scott telling them about game design and stuff.

751
00:43:13,651 --> 00:43:15,368
Speaker 1: So, uh, these panels are not for you.

752
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:20,450
Speaker 1: They're for your friend who doesn't know enough names of games to play.

753
00:43:20,791 --> 00:43:20,984
Speaker 1: All right.

754
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:23,090
Speaker 1: So tell your friends to go to this panel.

755
00:43:23,451 --> 00:43:26,350
Speaker 1: You yourself, the listener, you know what we're going to say.

756
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:29,949
Speaker 1: You do not need to go to these panels and let's get right into it.

757
00:43:30,212 --> 00:43:31,610
Speaker 1: There's an anime that we knew we needed.

758
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:34,610
Speaker 1: We had to watch, uh, we had like a hundred percent.

759
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:36,730
Speaker 1: This is the kind of show we judged it.

760
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:40,570
Speaker 0: We said, Oh shit, that is a show made by Kuni Igu Iguahara.

761
00:43:40,935 --> 00:43:41,769
Speaker 1: We're going to watch it.

762
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:50,510
Speaker 0: He who directed some episodes of Sailor Moon and then made Utena, made Utena the movie, made, then didn't take anything, then made that bear show.

763
00:43:51,272 --> 00:43:53,209
Speaker 0: Well, there's penguin drum, which we didn't watch.

764
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:55,929
Speaker 0: I didn't watch the penguin show or the bear show.

765
00:43:56,472 --> 00:43:57,489
Speaker 0: And now he's made the kappa show.

766
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:58,208
Speaker 1: No, I can't.

767
00:43:58,410 --> 00:43:59,830
Speaker 1: The bear show is so good.

768
00:44:00,132 --> 00:44:00,390
Speaker 0: All right.

769
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:02,270
Speaker 0: So there's a lot of things that are so good.

770
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:02,910
Speaker 0: How much time I got?

771
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:03,668
Speaker 0: I got to read Telegenji.

772
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:06,010
Speaker 0: So you know what's better than bear show?

773
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:06,689
Speaker 0: Lone Wolf and Cup.

774
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:08,490
Speaker 1: So we're going to talk about Sarazanmai.

775
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:09,810
Speaker 1: We've only seen a few episodes.

776
00:44:10,192 --> 00:44:13,169
Speaker 1: I know a lot more about it than I think Scott does.

777
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:16,650
Speaker 1: And I've seen Yurikuma Arashi.

778
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:19,250
Speaker 1: So there's a lot of parallels I can draw between the two.

779
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:20,830
Speaker 0: There's a lot of parallels between a lot of things.

780
00:44:21,212 --> 00:44:22,830
Speaker 0: I've only seen two episodes of Sarazanmai.

781
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:26,790
Speaker 0: Usually we watch three or four, but we didn't have anything else to do the show on.

782
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:28,129
Speaker 0: And we wanted to do a show.

783
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:32,670
Speaker 1: We're going to review it to tell you can figure out if you need to watch it or not.

784
00:44:33,491 --> 00:44:36,470
Speaker 1: You should watch it, but you may not be the kind of person who wants to see it.

785
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:37,370
Speaker 0: Stop listening to Geek Nights.

786
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:39,030
Speaker 0: I don't know why you even listen to it in the first place.

787
00:44:39,271 --> 00:44:43,030
Speaker 1: But we're not going to spoil anything because I don't want to spoil.

788
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:44,029
Speaker 0: I've seen two episodes.

789
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:46,997
Speaker 1: So here's the thing about your.

790
00:44:47,178 --> 00:44:51,410
Speaker 1: I was about to say Yurikuma Arashi, which of Tezuka's poster tenant works.

791
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:55,930
Speaker 1: I really like Yurikuma Arashi and I think it is definitely worth watching.

792
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:56,867
Speaker 0: You mean Ikuhara?

793
00:44:57,871 --> 00:44:58,370
Speaker 1: Lesbian bear.

794
00:44:58,570 --> 00:44:59,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, you said Tezuka.

795
00:44:59,915 --> 00:45:00,187
Speaker 1: I did.

796
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:00,930
Speaker 1: It's a different person.

797
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:01,158
Speaker 1: I did.

798
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:04,710
Speaker 1: Lesbian Bear Storm is another way to translate the name of that show.

799
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:05,288
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

800
00:45:05,851 --> 00:45:14,230
Speaker 1: I would say if you have not seen anything that Ikuhara made, you should watch them in the order that they were released.

801
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:20,689
Speaker 1: Watch the Sailor Moon parts that he had something to do with, like Sailor Moon S, the good Sailor Moon.

802
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:25,650
Speaker 1: Watch Utena and then just watch them in chronological release order.

803
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:26,649
Speaker 0: Oh, so you should watch Utena the movie.

804
00:45:27,492 --> 00:45:30,149
Speaker 1: Yeah, you should watch Utena the movie after you watch Utena the show.

805
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:34,450
Speaker 1: And before you watch Penguin Drum, Yurikuma Arashi or Sarazanmai.

806
00:45:34,994 --> 00:45:36,890
Speaker 0: You want to know something interesting I have on my calendar.

807
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:37,670
Speaker 0: Uh oh.

808
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:40,370
Speaker 0: Let me just find it here.

809
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:41,548
Speaker 1: I'm worried about what this is.

810
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:44,230
Speaker 0: On August 14th, 2019.

811
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:46,169
Speaker 1: August 14th, I will still be around.

812
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:52,248
Speaker 0: Utena the movie will be exactly 20 years old.

813
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:54,409
Speaker 1: God damn it, I am old.

814
00:45:55,670 --> 00:46:03,690
Speaker 1: God damn, I remember watching trailers to that movie and being crazy excited about it because I didn't know what it was going to be.

815
00:46:04,253 --> 00:46:07,410
Speaker 1: And I thought it would tell me more about Utena the TV show.

816
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:08,010
Speaker 0: That's right.

817
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:10,970
Speaker 1: And it didn't, but it taught me a lot about Ikuhara.

818
00:46:11,391 --> 00:46:12,161
Speaker 0: Also, this is the year

819
00:46:12,161 --> 00:46:14,190
Speaker 0: 2019. 1989

820
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:15,161
Speaker 0: Batman is 30 years old.

821
00:46:16,731 --> 00:46:19,330
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, we can play that game of things are old.

822
00:46:19,611 --> 00:46:20,003
Speaker 0: I'm just saying.

823
00:46:21,131 --> 00:46:24,759
Speaker 1: The 1989 Batman is still my favorite non-BTS Batman.

824
00:46:26,178 --> 00:46:26,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway.

825
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:28,108
Speaker 1: Not lying, not making a joke.

826
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:30,980
Speaker 0: So Sarazanmai is a show about Kappa.

827
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:32,409
Speaker 0: If you don't know Kappa.

828
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:33,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is all real.

829
00:46:34,354 --> 00:46:35,270
Speaker 1: You gotta know this shit.

830
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:38,070
Speaker 1: If you don't know about Japanese myths around Kappa.

831
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:41,990
Speaker 0: I know enough about Kappa to be dangerous, but I don't know everything there is to know about Kappa.

832
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:46,530
Speaker 1: You need to know more about Kappa than you probably do before you watch this show.

833
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:51,290
Speaker 1: Or you're going to be in the deep end of a pool and you're not going to be able to swear.

834
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:55,750
Speaker 0: So Kappa are like these mythical Japanese creatures that sort of look frog-like.

835
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:59,650
Speaker 1: Yep, they wear a dish on their head that makes them look like they have a monk's haircut.

836
00:46:59,912 --> 00:47:05,429
Speaker 0: Right, it makes them look like they shaved a circle at the top of their head, but actually they're wearing a dish on the top of their head.

837
00:47:07,352 --> 00:47:08,970
Speaker 1: They're frog-like, they're mystical creatures.

838
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:12,069
Speaker 1: The dish is important, like sealing their dish is a big deal.

839
00:47:12,851 --> 00:47:18,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, you'll see Kappa a lot in a lot of other animes and mangas, right?

840
00:47:18,491 --> 00:47:19,229
Speaker 0: Like Furakapa.

841
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:21,529
Speaker 0: Or Fura Fura Kappa.

842
00:47:22,191 --> 00:47:22,690
Speaker 1: Well, you know what?

843
00:47:23,251 --> 00:47:26,682
Speaker 1: If you're going to watch Sarazanmai, I'm going to read two sentences from Wikipedia.

844
00:47:29,812 --> 00:47:39,250
Speaker 1: This is what you need to know that unless you are an advanced anime fan or know about Japanese myth, you will not know.

845
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:44,428
Speaker 1: Quote, "The Kappa are known to favor cucumbers and love to engage in sumo

846
00:47:44,448 --> 00:47:44,830
Speaker 1: wrestling.".

847
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:45,418
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, they love cucumbers.

848
00:47:45,439 --> 00:47:46,088
Speaker 0: Yep, they love that too.

849
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:47,410
Speaker 0: That's sentence number one.

850
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:57,648
Speaker 1: Sentence number two, "They are often accused of assaulting humans in water and removing a mythical organ called a shirikodama from their victim's

851
00:47:57,788 --> 00:47:58,069
Speaker 1: anus.".

852
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:02,589
Speaker 0: Yep, so there's this idea that you have this organ in your body called a. what is it?

853
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:04,070
Speaker 1: Shirikodama.

854
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:06,410
Speaker 0: Right, which is not a real organ in the body.

855
00:48:07,691 --> 00:48:12,330
Speaker 1: It's a mythological organ that could be analogized to the prostate, maybe.

856
00:48:14,011 --> 00:48:17,949
Speaker 0: There's a made-up bodily organ, so it's sort of like, "I got your

857
00:48:17,969 --> 00:48:18,230
Speaker 0: finger.".

858
00:48:19,972 --> 00:48:21,680
Speaker 1: "I got this thing in your anus.

859
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:22,725
Speaker 1: that is the seed of your

860
00:48:22,786 --> 00:48:23,248
Speaker 1: desire.".

861
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:26,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Kappa like to steal it from people.

862
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:31,989
Speaker 0: So a mythical creature, there's a story about it stealing things from people's butts that they don't even have to begin with.

863
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:46,469
Speaker 1: Yep, some people will translate it or talk about it as a liver, depending on when you... But it is important that you know that Kappa will steal this mythical organ from humans' anuses and that Kappa like cucumbers and sumo.

864
00:48:47,433 --> 00:48:49,250
Speaker 1: And you need to know all the basic stuff about Kappa.

865
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:58,570
Speaker 0: There's also the area of Japan where the show takes place, which I forget the name of, is a place that is tied to a lot of Kappa lore.

866
00:48:59,471 --> 00:49:07,230
Speaker 0: The same way that when you watch Eccentric Family, that place in Japan is tied to a lot of Tanuki lore.

867
00:49:08,411 --> 00:49:12,990
Speaker 0: Or the way that certain places in the US are tied to Paul Bunyan lore.

868
00:49:14,731 --> 00:49:16,729
Speaker 1: Johnny Appleseed, that kind of thing.

869
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:22,650
Speaker 0: Right, the same kind of thing, where there's a myth, but the myth has a connection to a real world geography.

870
00:49:23,092 --> 00:49:27,130
Speaker 0: And that's what's going on here, because the show takes place basically in the Kappa area.

871
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:41,090
Speaker 1: So you need to know all of that because that is what this show is about on the surface in the same way that Utena on the surface is about a bunch of high school kids fighting over who gets to go up into a floating castle and become God.

872
00:49:43,992 --> 00:49:45,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the shallow part of the pool.

873
00:49:46,211 --> 00:49:47,580
Speaker 0: Right, so the show, Sara's on my...

874
00:49:49,615 --> 00:49:51,690
Speaker 1: Now take all that and add the Ikuhara factor.

875
00:49:51,690 --> 00:50:01,089
Speaker 0: So you have this kid, he's the main character, and he's just like a high school kid doing high school kid stuff, but he's got secrets.

876
00:50:01,571 --> 00:50:02,390
Speaker 1: Yep, everyone has secrets.

877
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:03,870
Speaker 0: He's got secrets, right?

878
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:05,008
Speaker 0: And the show stylizes this.

879
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:09,650
Speaker 0: And the secrets, they're not extreme, crazy secrets, but they're quite out of the ordinary.

880
00:50:11,373 --> 00:50:13,370
Speaker 0: They're not like ridiculous, totally ridiculous.

881
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:18,730
Speaker 1: They're not that out of the ordinary in terms of a lot of people got secrets on that level.

882
00:50:19,191 --> 00:50:24,410
Speaker 0: People do have secrets on that level, but this specifically I think would not apply to maybe zero people on Earth.

883
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:30,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, the second secret we learned about him is probably more common of committing that kind of crime because you've got problems.

884
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:32,230
Speaker 0: Yes, that is true.

885
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:41,490
Speaker 0: So in the course of him taking care of his secret biz, he bumps into some other kids in town.

886
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:45,530
Speaker 0: One of them is like a criminal who's trying to jack cars and works for the Yakuza or something.

887
00:50:47,372 --> 00:50:52,970
Speaker 1: The second kid, it's like, okay, the show, you see this kid, you're like, okay, this kid's going to be some kind of delinquent.

888
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:58,810
Speaker 1: We're going to have main guy who's got a thing, delinquent guy, and then the third kid.

889
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:03,190
Speaker 0: The third kid you don't learn too much about in two episodes, but he's obviously the nerd kid.

890
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:10,550
Speaker 1: And like the next scene with the delinquent kid is he is literally fucking waterboarding someone for the mob.

891
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:10,891
Speaker 1: Yep.

892
00:51:11,152 --> 00:51:13,201
Speaker 0: But anyway, so they all go to the same school.

893
00:51:13,402 --> 00:51:15,170
Speaker 0: They get entwined with each other.

894
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:24,330
Speaker 0: And what really, really because there's nothing really to bring them together other than circumstance is that they happen to all basically get stuck dealing with this cop.

895
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:28,749
Speaker 1: This cop, just like this fat, lazy cop is just hanging out and they all meet him.

896
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:29,491
Speaker 0: Right.

897
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:36,830
Speaker 0: They awaken this cop who is dormant and they all get trapped by him into, you know, the same way that it's like, oh, you're up the genie lab.

898
00:51:36,931 --> 00:51:38,499
Speaker 0: Now you're stuck with all this genie biz.

899
00:51:38,961 --> 00:51:40,550
Speaker 0: Well, you're stuck with cop a biz now.

900
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:41,650
Speaker 1: Or like in Yuri Kuma.

901
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:42,509
Speaker 0: Welcome to COPPA.

902
00:51:43,593 --> 00:51:45,801
Speaker 1: Your girlfriend got eaten by a bear.

903
00:51:46,022 --> 00:51:48,030
Speaker 1: Bears are lesbians from outer space.

904
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:49,722
Speaker 0: Now you have to deal with bears now.

905
00:51:49,802 --> 00:51:50,830
Speaker 1: No escaping the bear plot.

906
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:54,450
Speaker 1: And then the whole show is about a world where bears just randomly attack people.

907
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:55,273
Speaker 0: So no escape.

908
00:51:55,293 --> 00:51:57,725
Speaker 0: This guy, these kids cannot escape the COPPA plot.

909
00:51:57,745 --> 00:51:58,650
Speaker 0: So what's the COPPA plot?

910
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:13,630
Speaker 0: The COPPA plot is that there are, I guess, sort of these things they have to fight in similar plot structure, similar episode structure to say in Utena or any sort of one of those anime where, you know, the episode leads up to a battle of some kind.

911
00:52:14,111 --> 00:52:20,530
Speaker 0: You know, it has the same structure, not as much as Tatami Galaxy has the exact same structure every episode.

912
00:52:21,072 --> 00:52:24,930
Speaker 0: But quite some more like Utena, right, where it's like, OK, things happen.

913
00:52:25,231 --> 00:52:28,129
Speaker 0: There's a lead in plot, sort of like a Simpsons episode.

914
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:30,360
Speaker 1: Then there's a duel with some special music.

915
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:32,490
Speaker 1: that like is the climax of that little mini plot.

916
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:33,391
Speaker 0: There's a duel.

917
00:52:33,451 --> 00:52:48,570
Speaker 0: So in the duel, basically the characters had to somehow reveal one of their secrets, you know, and involve that anus organ and COPPA going on into some of this attacking move that allows them to win the battle.

918
00:52:49,491 --> 00:52:55,045
Speaker 0: It's a very allegorical battle and not a true actual battle.

919
00:52:55,125 --> 00:52:56,930
Speaker 0: It's not physical shounen combat.

920
00:52:56,990 --> 00:53:08,910
Speaker 1: If Ikuhara has had a artistic trend over time from Utena onward, it is to have a show that is deeply allegorical and works on multiple levels, even under very careful scrutiny.

921
00:53:09,651 --> 00:53:20,150
Speaker 1: But as his creative works have progressed, he gets more and more heavily focused on the allegory to the point that the surface details barely make sense.

922
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:22,398
Speaker 0: In Utena they actually show you some sword fighting.

923
00:53:22,418 --> 00:53:25,250
Speaker 0: In Sarazanmai they don't show you any fighting.

924
00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:38,630
Speaker 1: It's singing and butt juices everywhere and monsters flying through the sky and the otter police or literal sexy otter dudes.

925
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:38,891
Speaker 0: Right.

926
00:53:38,951 --> 00:53:48,030
Speaker 0: It's not the same style as the witches in Madoka, but it is just as sort of wacky all over the place in terms of like, you know, anyway.

927
00:53:49,091 --> 00:54:01,730
Speaker 0: And yet when they do this and they fight and win the battles to protect whatever the fuck from whatever it is that COPPA wants them to fight, they basically, based on what secrets they revealed, they get a plate.

928
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:05,870
Speaker 0: And if they get a golden plate, they can literally make a wish with the golden plate.

929
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:08,200
Speaker 1: I love how the nerd kid fucks that up like right away.

930
00:54:08,241 --> 00:54:08,783
Speaker 1: Here's the wish.

931
00:54:08,944 --> 00:54:09,607
Speaker 1: Oh, you wasted it.

932
00:54:09,868 --> 00:54:10,230
Speaker 1: Good job.

933
00:54:10,771 --> 00:54:21,450
Speaker 0: And if you get silver plates, you need to collect a bunch of silver plates together and then you can get a golden plate or just make a wish, I guess, with a bunch of silver plates, something like that.

934
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:25,870
Speaker 1: No, clearly the COPPA is manipulating these kids for his own ends.

935
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:26,771
Speaker 0: Clearly.

936
00:54:27,293 --> 00:54:33,810
Speaker 0: It's not a good situation, but that's what's going on is the kids, all three of them, you're going to follow them.

937
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:34,814
Speaker 0: They're secret.

938
00:54:34,834 --> 00:54:37,370
Speaker 0: They also transform into COPPA when the shit goes down, by the way.

939
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:37,610
Speaker 1: Yeah.

940
00:54:37,631 --> 00:54:40,577
Speaker 1: The only reason they're doing these fights, it did skip that.

941
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:46,290
Speaker 1: The COPPA turns them into COPPA and he's like, go steal the anus organ from this zombie.

942
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:51,110
Speaker 1: We'll get to the zombies because the zombies are created by the Otter police.

943
00:54:52,571 --> 00:54:53,330
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, the Otter police.

944
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:55,074
Speaker 1: You got to just watch this show.

945
00:54:56,076 --> 00:55:00,046
Speaker 1: It's, it's pretty crazy in a really good way.

946
00:55:00,066 --> 00:55:01,730
Speaker 1: And it escalates rapidly.

947
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:19,230
Speaker 1: And I think in the end, much like Utena and Yurikuma Arashi, it's really about the little secrets that humans have and hide from each other and the pain of those being revealed and the, like a Evangelion and the Hedgehog's dilemma, the pain of getting close to someone.

948
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:25,730
Speaker 1: There is always discomfort and pain the more you share with other people, but yet sharing is the only way to grow and change.

949
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:28,490
Speaker 1: It's, there's a lot of allegories around that kind of thing.

950
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:33,270
Speaker 0: You know, the human desire, you know, and then the stealing of it by the COPPA.

951
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:40,610
Speaker 1: But also like you may have a desire, but depending on how you express that desire could be harmful to other people, harmful to yourself.

952
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:42,113
Speaker 0: Your secret desires.

953
00:55:42,133 --> 00:55:47,470
Speaker 0: You know, it's like things you really love, but you can't show people that you love these things.

954
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:54,690
Speaker 1: Or things that you love, but if you embrace a hedonistic version of those things, it may end up being harmful in a way that a different kind of expression.

955
00:55:55,273 --> 00:55:58,970
Speaker 1: Those are the kinds of topics this show looks like it's going to be dealing with.

956
00:56:00,531 --> 00:56:10,370
Speaker 1: As opposed to say, Yurikuma Arashi, which is very specifically focused on lesbian issues in Japan and like people navigating those spaces.

957
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:15,109
Speaker 1: And Utena is about adolescence and feminism and etc.

958
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:23,330
Speaker 0: It takes the lens of COPPA folklore, applies it to three characters, high school kids, you know, to examine those topics.

959
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:26,650
Speaker 0: And that's what I've learned from two episodes, who knows what's going to happen.

960
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:29,725
Speaker 0: And it's not too many episodes, it's only what, eleven, twelve?

961
00:56:29,785 --> 00:56:30,670
Speaker 1: It's not a long show.

962
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:32,350
Speaker 1: Neither is Yurikuma, Yurikuma is pretty short.

963
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:37,110
Speaker 0: It's not some twenty-six episode, thirty plus, like Utena is what, thirty-nine?

964
00:56:37,432 --> 00:56:37,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, thirty-nine.

965
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:38,669
Speaker 0: This is way shorter.

966
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:47,088
Speaker 1: My advice to you, if you watch this, or any Ikuhara show, treat them all the same way we treat Utena on.

967
00:56:47,108 --> 00:56:48,090
Speaker 1: Geek Nights Presents Utena.

968
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:58,130
Speaker 1: Meaning, if you watch Saruzanmai, pay attention to the show really closely and look at all the little details and see what you can piece together.

969
00:56:58,310 --> 00:57:03,289
Speaker 1: Like, look for stuff, don't trust what the characters are telling you, don't trust what the show is showing you.

970
00:57:04,351 --> 00:57:08,122
Speaker 1: Just like in Utena, don't just say, "Oh, sword fighting castle in the sky?

971
00:57:08,142 --> 00:57:10,689
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's some anime, that stuff just happens in

972
00:57:10,709 --> 00:57:10,890
Speaker 1: anime.".

973
00:57:11,031 --> 00:57:14,490
Speaker 1: No, there's a literal castle in the sky and literal sword.

974
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:23,528
Speaker 1: So in the show, there are literal butt juices, literal kappa, literal shirokodama, the butt anus organ.

975
00:57:25,291 --> 00:57:30,150
Speaker 1: Think about those things in a very literal and direct way and then try to figure out the allegories from there.

976
00:57:30,632 --> 00:57:32,348
Speaker 1: And the show will be very enriching to you.

977
00:57:34,112 --> 00:57:36,889
Speaker 1: I like it a lot and I'm going to watch the rest of it and we'll probably do a final...

978
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:37,630
Speaker 0: I'll watch it eventually.

979
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:41,489
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think we should watch it while the iron's hot because we could do a final thoughts episode on this.

980
00:57:42,832 --> 00:57:43,441
Speaker 0: I just want to go home.

981
00:57:44,491 --> 00:57:46,009
Speaker 1: I'm not saying watch it right now.

982
00:57:47,413 --> 00:57:49,270
Speaker 1: I got to go for a run and eat some food, so I think we're done.

983
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:52,750
Speaker 1: That image that I just put up on the screen, that is the show.

984
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:01,120
