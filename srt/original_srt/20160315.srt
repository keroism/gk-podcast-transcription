1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,363
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday March 15th 2016.

2
00:00:11,363 --> 00:00:17,859
Speaker 1: I'm rim, I'm Scott and this is geek night tonight gaming news.

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,618
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:28,550
Speaker 1: So many of you might have been wondering what was up with my Twitter the other night between me and Emily.

5
00:00:28,871 --> 00:00:30,999
Speaker 0: I think most people listening are not reading your Twitter.

6
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,845
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know I got more followers than you.

7
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:34,250
Speaker 0: I don't really care.

8
00:00:34,371 --> 00:00:35,377
Speaker 1: Yeah, I do.

9
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:36,988
Speaker 0: how many people are actually reading that?

10
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:37,049
Speaker 0: uh?

11
00:00:38,296 --> 00:00:39,301
Speaker 1: I think a reasonable number.

12
00:00:39,321 --> 00:00:40,890
Speaker 1: a few people reacted to what I true.

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,229
Speaker 1: so basically what happened was something happened, and I was typing some tweets like hey guys what's going on?

14
00:00:46,249 --> 00:00:49,926
Speaker 1: and I'd like tweeted one, and then I realized there was a typo.

15
00:00:49,946 --> 00:00:51,486
Speaker 1: so I deleted it And then I retweeted it.

16
00:00:51,971 --> 00:00:59,490
Speaker 1: But because I did that after I'd sent the second tweet it ended up in my timeline sending one tweet before the other one.

17
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:06,982
Speaker 1: So the first thing that I actually said was basically We're at the ER now Emily's getting her eye checked out.

18
00:01:07,022 --> 00:01:13,903
Speaker 1: the explosion was substantial But we're mostly okay like something like that, but I didn't even have an eyepatch.

19
00:01:13,983 --> 00:01:14,665
Speaker 0: I was disappointed.

20
00:01:14,886 --> 00:01:18,598
Speaker 0: Yeah, though, so what happened was Disappointed because I wanted to get hurt more.

21
00:01:18,638 --> 00:01:19,824
Speaker 0: I want a cool eyepatch.

22
00:01:19,884 --> 00:01:21,896
Speaker 0: I Would know if I was there.

23
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:24,493
Speaker 0: I would have worn one even if I didn't need it It was.

24
00:01:24,713 --> 00:01:27,643
Speaker 1: luckily it is the part of the eye that Emily got cut on.

25
00:01:27,823 --> 00:01:32,386
Speaker 1: is the part that doesn't make you see well the Part that also apparently heals really really fast?

26
00:01:32,486 --> 00:01:33,415
Speaker 1: yeah, but yeah So we're.

27
00:01:33,436 --> 00:01:34,390
Speaker 0: I've been cut there as well.

28
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:39,110
Speaker 0: I got I was think we're at the beach when I was a kid me and my friend was throwing sand at each other.

29
00:01:40,252 --> 00:01:41,161
Speaker 1: That's the kind of thing you're doing.

30
00:01:41,182 --> 00:01:41,808
Speaker 1: you're a kid like you.

31
00:01:41,828 --> 00:01:47,513
Speaker 0: don't Balls of wet sand just throwing them at each other real hard like today Scott.

32
00:01:47,553 --> 00:01:50,849
Speaker 1: if I threw sand at you one I'd be worried that I'd hurt your eyes.

33
00:01:51,831 --> 00:01:54,029
Speaker 1: You'd be really worried that I hurt your eyes.

34
00:01:54,471 --> 00:01:56,298
Speaker 1: We wouldn't throw sand at each other like.

35
00:01:56,338 --> 00:02:09,919
Speaker 1: I can imagine what would happen if I threw sand at you and my brain says hey Cut it out Imagining being hit by sand and you're like oh fuck no and that is called empathy But as a kid we're just throwing sand at each other.

36
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:10,681
Speaker 0: We didn't give a fuck.

37
00:02:10,883 --> 00:02:14,650
Speaker 1: I got my eye scratched once Messing around with the dogs.

38
00:02:16,032 --> 00:02:22,950
Speaker 0: My eye was not as ugly looking as Emily's is but it I had to wear an eyepatch and shit and put like cream in it every day.

39
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,342
Speaker 1: Well, you might have had a puncture an infection or something.

40
00:02:25,403 --> 00:02:26,689
Speaker 0: I had to put cream in there every day.

41
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,470
Speaker 1: Emily just had a four millimeter cut Mm-hmm on the sclera.

42
00:02:31,631 --> 00:02:37,149
Speaker 1: But so basically where I'm sitting exactly where I am now and Emily sitting next to me and we're both working on stuff.

43
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:51,709
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm working on projects and I have the Red Wings game on and I literally say hey the game started again and Emily turns around Toward me and then there's an explosion Really loud and we are showered in broken glass.

44
00:02:52,791 --> 00:03:00,890
Speaker 1: So it took my brain easily a couple seconds to figure out that it wasn't the window getting blown out By like a bomb or something or the construction.

45
00:03:01,192 --> 00:03:04,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I mean there's construction for all I know a crane just like crashed through the window.

46
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:08,450
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah, I would definitely immediately assume something happened to the construction.

47
00:03:08,852 --> 00:03:26,936
Speaker 1: so we're both sitting there like I have my eyes closed and I kind of look up and Emily's sitting there with her head down and I shake myself and all the broken glass kind of comes off of me out of the Floor like alright and I look and Emily does the same thing and I look up and I see that the tempered glass Shield on top of a light.

48
00:03:27,277 --> 00:03:28,741
Speaker 0: that's in the room really weird light.

49
00:03:28,761 --> 00:03:30,326
Speaker 1: It's a standard torch air like.

50
00:03:30,346 --> 00:03:31,510
Speaker 1: there's nothing special about that.

51
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,442
Speaker 0: It's a weirdo light as a perfectly standard form of light.

52
00:03:34,502 --> 00:03:36,370
Speaker 0: No, there's only one standard form of light.

53
00:03:36,451 --> 00:03:37,909
Speaker 0: That is a light bulb on a stick.

54
00:03:38,673 --> 00:03:41,906
Speaker 1: That is just a light bulb on a stick Scott with it with a shade around.

55
00:03:41,946 --> 00:03:42,810
Speaker 0: There's a shade.

56
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,355
Speaker 0: It's upwards upside down.

57
00:03:45,395 --> 00:03:47,742
Speaker 1: You want the diffuse light to bounce off the ceiling.

58
00:03:47,782 --> 00:03:48,404
Speaker 1: come back down.

59
00:03:48,464 --> 00:03:50,490
Speaker 1: That's like nice modern lighting design.

60
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:52,117
Speaker 0: No, I want a normal lamp.

61
00:03:52,157 --> 00:03:53,001
Speaker 0: That's like next to you.

62
00:03:53,544 --> 00:03:54,628
Speaker 1: I could also have that.

63
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:56,196
Speaker 0: I guess Hey lamp, how you doing?

64
00:03:56,397 --> 00:03:59,050
Speaker 0: So or you know fishnet leg lamp.

65
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,910
Speaker 1: So the funny thing is the light was still on and it still works just fine.

66
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,501
Speaker 1: It wasn't the halogen bulb that exploded like you'd expect.

67
00:04:05,521 --> 00:04:06,485
Speaker 0: that would be really weird.

68
00:04:06,827 --> 00:04:14,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, so What actually happened and this is you know, all the news reports to read will say it's uncommon.

69
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:19,329
Speaker 1: But I've run into this enough times in my life to know it's a thing.

70
00:04:19,851 --> 00:04:25,370
Speaker 1: Tempered glass, you know safety glass the kind of glass you use if you have like a table or a windshield.

71
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:37,857
Speaker 1: So laminated is one part but also but that's not all of it Tempered glass is also way stronger than regular glass and if it shatters or breaks It'll break into small pieces.

72
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,890
Speaker 1: so it won't cut you because if you break a normal window you get big old chunks.

73
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,379
Speaker 0: Yeah chunks that are dangerous and sharp.

74
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:49,684
Speaker 1: Yeah, like if you think like oh, I'll just punch through a window You'll probably cut yourself so bad.

75
00:04:49,704 --> 00:04:50,650
Speaker 1: You have to go to the hospital.

76
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,567
Speaker 0: That's why you should wrap a towel around your hand and then punch the window.

77
00:04:53,607 --> 00:04:57,376
Speaker 1: Yes So and safety glass also.

78
00:04:57,536 --> 00:05:01,930
Speaker 0: don't punch one of those a modern window because it's usually two pieces of glass one after the other.

79
00:05:02,071 --> 00:05:05,450
Speaker 1: Well more importantly if you punch a modern window, you'll probably just break yourself and not the window.

80
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,776
Speaker 0: It's also true unless you're really good at punching.

81
00:05:07,977 --> 00:05:09,963
Speaker 1: So tempered glass is amazing.

82
00:05:10,003 --> 00:05:11,166
Speaker 1: It's super strong.

83
00:05:11,306 --> 00:05:12,630
Speaker 1: Like it's pretty much invincible.

84
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:14,463
Speaker 0: There's a reason they don't use it on phones.

85
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:24,220
Speaker 1: Uh So actually apparently people buy tempered glass screen protectors and Some phones have used tempered glass in the past.

86
00:05:24,481 --> 00:05:26,550
Speaker 0: Usually they use my gorilla grass or sapphire.

87
00:05:26,671 --> 00:05:29,867
Speaker 1: What probable the gorilla glass might be a form of tempered glass.

88
00:05:29,907 --> 00:05:30,550
Speaker 1: I'm actually not sure.

89
00:05:31,072 --> 00:05:32,740
Speaker 1: I don't know what gorilla glass is made about.

90
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,870
Speaker 0: I haven't been to the glass museum in like ten years.

91
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:42,827
Speaker 1: So so tempered glass effectively or the ten years has the outside of it Under extreme compressive force all the time.

92
00:05:42,928 --> 00:05:46,350
Speaker 1: by the way They made it and the inside of it has the opposite.

93
00:05:46,491 --> 00:05:54,000
Speaker 1: so it's actually sparse and the effect of this is that the whole thing is Straining at itself all the time.

94
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,409
Speaker 0: Isn't that the same things like a King Rupert's drop?

95
00:05:56,529 --> 00:06:04,683
Speaker 1: Yes It's actually as far as I can tell in my layman's understanding of physics a very similar principle Except it doesn't have Prince Rupert not King Rupert.

96
00:06:04,703 --> 00:06:07,396
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't have the Vulnerable tail at the end.

97
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:11,573
Speaker 0: It's sort of like wrapped around itself or maybe the vulnerable tail is just you don't know where it is Mixed in.

98
00:06:11,895 --> 00:06:19,507
Speaker 1: so basically if there is a flaw Unless you test it which will cause it to shatter at the time.

99
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:20,049
Speaker 1: You made it.

100
00:06:20,692 --> 00:06:21,455
Speaker 1: There's no way to know.

101
00:06:21,516 --> 00:06:26,355
Speaker 1: it all looks the same and apparently most tempered glass companies don't test Because it costs the money.

102
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:26,977
Speaker 1: and why bother?

103
00:06:26,997 --> 00:06:31,170
Speaker 0: well, I mean usually people even like people that make really fancy things.

104
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:45,009
Speaker 0: It's like I know cameras like they'll test like every tenth camera or something because it's like testing all of them takes too much time And you're making too many of them basically tempered glass if it has a microscopic defect in it at any point.

105
00:06:45,691 --> 00:06:57,503
Speaker 1: Then it may at some point in the next 10 to 30 years for literally no measurable demonstrable or repeatable reason Explode violently.

106
00:06:57,523 --> 00:06:57,968
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

107
00:06:58,394 --> 00:07:04,990
Speaker 1: And if you go on YouTube You'll find a lot like the very regular news story of some people are home and they hear an explosion.

108
00:07:05,332 --> 00:07:08,370
Speaker 0: No, no one was lucky enough to have the camera rolling just while it happened.

109
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:13,229
Speaker 1: There are a bunch of videos of it happening on like security cameras and things and it's a thing.

110
00:07:13,832 --> 00:07:17,565
Speaker 1: So we bought a new torsion lamp and I'm gonna try something.

111
00:07:18,086 --> 00:07:19,110
Speaker 1: I bought a halogen.

112
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,172
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah So I got.

113
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:20,755
Speaker 1: I bought.

114
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:24,830
Speaker 1: I have a halogen one that I might buy another one of the one I'm touching right now in the studio.

115
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:33,069
Speaker 1: Cuz I like it, but I got an LED one that has a ring of LEDs on the top and I'm gonna see if that's actually bright enough.

116
00:07:33,672 --> 00:07:37,443
Speaker 1: It is very hard to research on the internet to find out how bright lamps are.

117
00:07:37,744 --> 00:07:42,398
Speaker 1: everyone just lies like the manufacturers Make up bullshit about how bright their lamps are.

118
00:07:42,619 --> 00:07:46,250
Speaker 0: I bought an LED light bulb just to put in a regular old lamp.

119
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,654
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's totally fine.

120
00:07:47,975 --> 00:07:52,650
Speaker 1: Yep, but I don't know if it'll produce enough lumens to illuminate an entire room.

121
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,473
Speaker 1: We're gonna find out.

122
00:07:53,513 --> 00:07:58,330
Speaker 0: you just need more of them maybe but I mean it's as bright as a 60 watt or whatever bulb.

123
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,174
Speaker 0: So it's the same thing.

124
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:02,693
Speaker 1: So anyway, we shake ourselves off and I'm like, I think I'm okay How about you?

125
00:08:02,753 --> 00:08:12,478
Speaker 1: and Emily says I think I'm fine and then she looks up at me and I see blood Trickling out of her eye and I see blood The worst possible place.

126
00:08:12,498 --> 00:08:23,533
Speaker 1: She's like do I look okay, and I'm like and I'm doing that like yeah But maybe we should go to a clinic just in case you know as I like starting to google for like where the nearest emergency Is.

127
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:35,659
Speaker 1: So, uh, yeah it ended up being fine and actually the doctor we saw was really funny and really nerdy and I counted for a Lot and we were kind of talking shot up out of hospitals.

128
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:43,770
Speaker 1: and the final funny that I have is that while we were waiting I was explaining how ICD codes work and I used to work in hospitals a long time ago.

129
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:44,715
Speaker 1: I've dealt with all this crap.

130
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:51,070
Speaker 1: So the way you code an injury I was trying to figure out what the code was gonna be for glass in the eyeball.

131
00:08:51,434 --> 00:08:52,869
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I think I figured it out.

132
00:08:53,492 --> 00:09:02,247
Speaker 1: I should go check once I get the insurance thing back, but then I realized in a moment of glory You know the picture of an eyeball and then a picture of a knife and then a picture of a skull.

133
00:09:02,448 --> 00:09:04,616
Speaker 1: So Here's the side.

134
00:09:05,037 --> 00:09:08,810
Speaker 1: do not ever google for different kinds of eye injuries.

135
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,758
Speaker 1: No, do not figure out how bad they are.

136
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:15,528
Speaker 1: No, you will see the worst things you've ever seen.

137
00:09:15,608 --> 00:09:18,699
Speaker 1: rotten knuckle Good God right there.

138
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:21,070
Speaker 1: It was like a screw like in an eye.

139
00:09:21,693 --> 00:09:26,760
Speaker 0: Like if there's two boxes and one of them says goatee and the other one says eye injury Let's just open the goatee box.

140
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:26,982
Speaker 0: Yes.

141
00:09:27,022 --> 00:09:32,374
Speaker 1: Hey, but awesome But I Realized what.

142
00:09:32,434 --> 00:09:33,639
Speaker 1: so, you know your clever idea.

143
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:41,208
Speaker 1: if you want to get like all the New York sports jerseys But have the names like rot to like rotated across all the different sports.

144
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:53,390
Speaker 1: Sure I want to do a hockey jersey, but I want to have the ice the International ICD code For an injury caused by a pie hockey puck specifically to the striking you in the face.

145
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,401
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that code is like w 220 220 or something like that.

146
00:09:57,922 --> 00:09:59,787
Speaker 1: That's what I'm gonna get on my Rangers Jersey.

147
00:10:00,249 --> 00:10:02,210
Speaker 1: sure It's no good.

148
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,080
Speaker 1: I already have a Red Wings Jersey.

149
00:10:06,643 --> 00:10:07,850
Speaker 1: I'm also gonna get a Red Wings Jersey.

150
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,984
Speaker 1: And so I actually have a conundrum.

151
00:10:10,004 --> 00:10:15,549
Speaker 1: We saw the Isabelle cup Like I saw the cup come out first time I've ever seen and anyone for anyone seen.

152
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,430
Speaker 0: But it's the first time ever seen before cup.

153
00:10:18,711 --> 00:10:26,119
Speaker 1: It's the first time I have ever seen in person a hockey game where an end dot star HL Cup came out.

154
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,690
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, and it was actually kind of exciting.

155
00:10:29,112 --> 00:10:38,830
Speaker 1: So I kind of want a riveters Jersey because they're the New York team But I kind of want a Boston Pride Jersey because they're far and away the best team.

156
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:42,768
Speaker 0: Well, I mean we went to that footy game, right?

157
00:10:43,931 --> 00:10:44,693
Speaker 0: Would you button?

158
00:10:45,054 --> 00:10:50,630
Speaker 1: but we chose the Jersey based on who had the best logo right and I think stealth jet wins the logo.

159
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:55,770
Speaker 0: I think they were also the home team and we weren't, you know aware before the game started who was better.

160
00:10:56,352 --> 00:10:59,986
Speaker 1: Yeah, I saw that stealth bomber logo and I was like, that's the one that team.

161
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:09,628
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, yeah, so that was an exciting night But actually the emergency room in Queens at that hospital right by Scott so on this being renovated.

162
00:11:09,648 --> 00:11:13,020
Speaker 1: Yeah Way, okay, like you just went into.

163
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,387
Speaker 0: the good time might have been.

164
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,033
Speaker 1: it was real crowded But everyone's got a chill.

165
00:11:16,074 --> 00:11:18,382
Speaker 1: it was it was the opposite of that time.

166
00:11:18,422 --> 00:11:20,570
Speaker 1: you and Emily took me to get my finger sewn back.

167
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,453
Speaker 0: I mean, it wasn't.

168
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:22,777
Speaker 0: it wasn't like.

169
00:11:22,817 --> 00:11:24,201
Speaker 0: that was a Newburgh Hospital.

170
00:11:24,221 --> 00:11:24,984
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can.

171
00:11:25,004 --> 00:11:27,070
Speaker 0: you could have gone to a Bronx Hospital, right?

172
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:30,296
Speaker 0: It's like yeah You were in Astoria Hospital.

173
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:40,243
Speaker 1: Yeah, also having worked in emergency rooms all over the Bronx in an earlier life Uh Yeah, the emergency room in that hospital in Queens way better.

174
00:11:40,263 --> 00:11:44,590
Speaker 1: if you're in the Bronx and you hurt yourself I would suggest you make your way down to queen promise.

175
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:51,523
Speaker 0: So the reason that hospital is being redone actually is because the town Councilman who is the Greek guy because they voted for the Greek guy no matter what.

176
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,110
Speaker 1: that's how Queen Astoria does.

177
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:57,042
Speaker 0: yeah, one of his like campaign promises was redoing that hospital.

178
00:11:57,082 --> 00:12:06,370
Speaker 0: and the reason is because like his dad had a heart attack or a stroke or something and Ambulance took him all the way to Manhattan and he was like what the fuck there's a hospital in Astoria, right?

179
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,322
Speaker 0: My dad would have been better off if you would have gotten the hospital sooner.

180
00:12:09,523 --> 00:12:11,310
Speaker 0: Obviously, that's a big factor, right?

181
00:12:11,691 --> 00:12:12,615
Speaker 0: Why didn't you take him there?

182
00:12:12,636 --> 00:12:14,003
Speaker 0: They're like the hospitals too small.

183
00:12:14,023 --> 00:12:15,330
Speaker 0: So he's like, I'm gonna make it bigger.

184
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:21,585
Speaker 1: So it's weird that that sort of selfish like personal experience is what drives someone to political action.

185
00:12:21,626 --> 00:12:26,190
Speaker 1: But at the same time if Hitler saves a puppy still saved a puppy.

186
00:12:26,752 --> 00:12:30,930
Speaker 0: Is it necessarily good that the hospitals getting bigger or is that just a corrupt thing?

187
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,898
Speaker 1: Well, I we can see really need that hospital be big.

188
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:34,801
Speaker 1: Yeah, we do.

189
00:12:35,183 --> 00:12:40,124
Speaker 0: Our hospitals are in really sad state But I mean that specific one in that specific spot.

190
00:12:40,164 --> 00:12:41,410
Speaker 1: I'll take any better hospital.

191
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:46,130
Speaker 1: Do you really think that if that hospital didn't get better some other hospital was gonna get better?

192
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,217
Speaker 0: Maybe a second hospital a better idea.

193
00:12:48,237 --> 00:12:56,554
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I said the only thing that would happen is some other Representative Monster in that hospital.

194
00:12:56,574 --> 00:13:00,042
Speaker 1: Yeah thing is enlightened self-interest.

195
00:13:00,323 --> 00:13:02,889
Speaker 1: That's the hospital I can get to on the end train.

196
00:13:04,411 --> 00:13:05,644
Speaker 1: That's where you can walk to it.

197
00:13:05,704 --> 00:13:06,250
Speaker 0: It's on crescent.

198
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:12,449
Speaker 1: Yeah, we actually took the subway to the hospital, but after I determined that the blood was not continuing to gush out of Emily's eye.

199
00:13:13,455 --> 00:13:15,349
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't pay ambulance fee if you don't have to.

200
00:13:15,651 --> 00:13:19,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, if someone can ask if they're okay, then you probably don't need an ambulance.

201
00:13:20,011 --> 00:13:23,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, usually but what about the situation where the person like in like there's?

202
00:13:23,161 --> 00:13:30,290
Speaker 1: this is a classic scene in horror movies where the person Looks up and you see their face and they look fine and they ask hey, am I okay?

203
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:34,403
Speaker 1: Okay, and then it pans to the other person's face and they look horrified.

204
00:13:34,664 --> 00:13:37,373
Speaker 1: and then it pans back and you see like the poles Sticking out of their chest.

205
00:13:37,554 --> 00:13:38,557
Speaker 0: that doesn't really happen.

206
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:40,282
Speaker 1: I'll bet that happens.

207
00:13:40,784 --> 00:13:41,125
Speaker 0: I don't know.

208
00:13:41,486 --> 00:13:42,830
Speaker 1: I will bet that happens.

209
00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:45,210
Speaker 0: I assume if you have you're impaled you're not talking.

210
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:46,920
Speaker 1: Anyway, you got any news or any things.

211
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,670
Speaker 1: or should we get into the gaming news roundup?

212
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,596
Speaker 0: Non gaming news.

213
00:13:51,656 --> 00:13:54,067
Speaker 0: this really I think I might have had one, but I forgot it.

214
00:13:54,107 --> 00:13:54,770
Speaker 0: So who gives a shit?

215
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,777
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a double Super Tuesday.

216
00:13:56,877 --> 00:14:00,349
Speaker 1: Donald Trump's probably gonna get the Republican nomination, which that is my sport to watch.

217
00:14:01,231 --> 00:14:01,994
Speaker 0: It's not a sport.

218
00:14:02,557 --> 00:14:03,501
Speaker 1: It is a sport on it.

219
00:14:03,561 --> 00:14:04,385
Speaker 1: It's a mind sport.

220
00:14:04,546 --> 00:14:05,972
Speaker 0: It's not you know What.

221
00:14:06,052 --> 00:14:10,990
Speaker 1: if so in that panel at magfest we have mind sport and like sports sport and a mind sport.

222
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,518
Speaker 0: You have to win by your own skills.

223
00:14:12,558 --> 00:14:13,926
Speaker 1: So this is a third one.

224
00:14:13,966 --> 00:14:14,710
Speaker 1: It's a money sport.

225
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,585
Speaker 0: It doesn't count.

226
00:14:17,665 --> 00:14:22,584
Speaker 0: see also Money is not Not a sport.

227
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,109
Speaker 1: things of the day.

228
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:34,504
Speaker 1: So nowadays the computers we don't really think much about random access memory.

229
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,330
Speaker 1: It's just your computers have RAM.

230
00:14:36,671 --> 00:14:45,870
Speaker 1: It's not like the random access is different from the other kinds of access because faster Everything that you interact your hard drives are random access.

231
00:14:46,831 --> 00:14:48,401
Speaker 0: Computers these days have like all.

232
00:14:48,522 --> 00:14:54,890
Speaker 0: it's basically, you know You need lots of memory, right and you want it to all be as fast as possible and have as much of it as possible.

233
00:14:55,051 --> 00:15:00,629
Speaker 0: But the faster it is like l1 cache like the fat or registers the fastest possible memory.

234
00:15:01,213 --> 00:15:04,010
Speaker 0: They just can't be that big because of physical limitations.

235
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:10,030
Speaker 0: So then we have l1 cache, which is like, okay We can make this a little bigger than registers and it's ridiculously fast.

236
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:14,576
Speaker 0: We put it like right next to it so he can still only have so much of it We can't have like.

237
00:15:14,837 --> 00:15:21,443
Speaker 0: it would be so awesome if you could have like 500 gigabytes of l1 cache it and not need any other storage whatsoever.

238
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:23,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay, but we can't do that yet.

239
00:15:24,151 --> 00:15:32,005
Speaker 0: So then we have l2 cache l3 and we have basically all the way down to your hard drive Which is multiple terabytes and it's still really really fast.

240
00:15:32,066 --> 00:15:44,194
Speaker 0: It's faster than like Registers used to I don't know as fast and registers used to be in old computers but it's faster than RAM used to be my computers most ways to get data in and out of Processing machines.

241
00:15:44,616 --> 00:15:55,150
Speaker 1: for most like much of the early history of computing as in like this Some of the stuff was still in use when we were born like was sequential access.

242
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:03,770
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean usually you had a computer and you would input with switches or tape or Cards and then it would output with lights or something like that.

243
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:08,450
Speaker 0: And then the only storage would be like flip actual flip-flops, right?

244
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:10,535
Speaker 0: Or maybe made of transistors.

245
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:16,210
Speaker 0: or maybe you're writing bits out to another tape or something or you have relays that like physical switches.

246
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:19,410
Speaker 0: They go kachunk kachunk and that's where the memory is stored, right?

247
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:26,090
Speaker 1: But the idea of addressing a particular part of your storage to get a particular thing right a real to real tape.

248
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,492
Speaker 0: You can't address it Just.

249
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,630
Speaker 0: it just allows you to have a really big output.

250
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:35,029
Speaker 0: But you have to output everything all at once and then you can read it back all at once just like you can't.

251
00:16:35,109 --> 00:16:39,350
Speaker 0: it's hard Fast-forward and rewind and zoom get to the exact spot on a cassette tape.

252
00:16:39,471 --> 00:16:40,710
Speaker 0: So this you drive yourself insane.

253
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:47,918
Speaker 1: so the kind of stuff I'm talking about is from the era where it was literally feasible if you had a network device or a way to communicate with another device.

254
00:16:47,938 --> 00:17:01,739
Speaker 1: a Feasible way to get more storage would be to send data to someone knowing that it'll come back to you milliseconds later and By offloading data like that.

255
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,930
Speaker 1: You could use that as a poor man's RAM.

256
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:10,483
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, I mean if you play any of the Zachtronics games, especially the new one where that's like assembly code What the hell's the name of the stupid thing?

257
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:14,358
Speaker 0: Oh, uh Space cam no space cam is the old one.

258
00:17:14,377 --> 00:17:14,638
Speaker 0: Yeah.

259
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:17,849
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's the new one the one where you're programming a computer.

260
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,477
Speaker 0: Yeah, you literally have to do that.

261
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:20,359
Speaker 1: I see something.

262
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,886
Speaker 0: Yeah, they don't give you RAM really.

263
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:33,127
Speaker 0: so a lot of times we have to do is take another node and all that node will do is basically accept an input and Then send that output out another, you know port on request.

264
00:17:33,528 --> 00:17:40,110
Speaker 0: that way It's basically acting as a space to store like a byte of memory, right, but it's really just another computer.

265
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,073
Speaker 0: So it's like you have to.

266
00:17:41,414 --> 00:17:42,237
Speaker 0: you have two computers.

267
00:17:42,277 --> 00:17:45,970
Speaker 0: They only consist of transistors and flip-flops and whatever, you know.

268
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,585
Speaker 0: But you can say hey listen send these bits over to that computer.

269
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:50,870
Speaker 0: that computer is program.

270
00:17:50,952 --> 00:17:58,530
Speaker 0: Hey Scott Say take input store and register when and then if you receive this input send your the memory that's in your register to the output.

271
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:02,430
Speaker 1: Yep, or like hey Scott saved the number eight to me in 12 seconds like that kind of nonsense.

272
00:18:03,313 --> 00:18:07,789
Speaker 1: This is a collection of early random access devices.

273
00:18:07,849 --> 00:18:11,716
Speaker 1: eight like See, I wasn't listening.

274
00:18:11,736 --> 00:18:12,138
Speaker 1: I'm fucked.

275
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,144
Speaker 1: That's gone for that.

276
00:18:13,184 --> 00:18:14,229
Speaker 1: That number is gone forever.

277
00:18:17,073 --> 00:18:22,602
Speaker 0: So we're talking about dektrons Williams tubes, which are literally I've never seen.

278
00:18:22,622 --> 00:18:23,826
Speaker 0: I've never seen most of these things.

279
00:18:23,867 --> 00:18:34,801
Speaker 1: So Williams tube you basically have a monitor and you illuminate a dot on it and Before the dot fades you look back to see what was there.

280
00:18:34,821 --> 00:18:37,550
Speaker 1: so you basically have a monitor that is ran.

281
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,573
Speaker 0: Is it a cathode ray?

282
00:18:38,713 --> 00:18:39,135
Speaker 0: Yes.

283
00:18:39,155 --> 00:18:41,482
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a cathode ray tube because castle.

284
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:44,270
Speaker 0: so it's a camera and a TV hooked up back to back.

285
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,396
Speaker 1: Yeah, so think of a mod like a traditional CRT.

286
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:51,490
Speaker 1: It's scanning right but theoretically it can address any individual point on the CRT.

287
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:51,991
Speaker 1: It's just.

288
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:56,870
Speaker 1: that would be stupid and useless unless you were trying to use your monitor as RAM.

289
00:18:57,272 --> 00:18:59,244
Speaker 0: But TV camera is the same thing.

290
00:18:59,285 --> 00:19:00,070
Speaker 0: It's a cathode ray.

291
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:08,900
Speaker 0: it just goes in reverse and scans the image into the signal and then you send that second runs over to the TV that Mercury back out delay lines.

292
00:19:09,221 --> 00:19:11,590
Speaker 1: I mean some of this stuff is terrifying.

293
00:19:12,415 --> 00:19:13,361
Speaker 1: Core memory, which?

294
00:19:13,703 --> 00:19:14,930
Speaker 0: why didn't you save this for Monday?

295
00:19:15,575 --> 00:19:20,270
Speaker 0: because this is Interesting isn't core memory like the way like I mean a bio?

296
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:24,100
Speaker 0: Bios is like a circuit breaker right a grid of circuit breakers.

297
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,970
Speaker 0: core memory is a grid of ferrite cores.

298
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:32,340
Speaker 0: That's similar to a BIOS, I guess they're not Fuses though.

299
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,008
Speaker 0: There's a YouTube.

300
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:38,030
Speaker 1: now There's a YouTube video on this link that shows you what core memory looks like and how it works.

301
00:19:38,752 --> 00:19:43,288
Speaker 1: And there are people whose hobby is to make core memory the same way that nerds make chain mail.

302
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,316
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm It's cool that you do.

303
00:19:45,336 --> 00:19:47,268
Speaker 0: they use their commit their computers, I guess.

304
00:19:49,812 --> 00:19:54,009
Speaker 1: But apparently core memory was almost always made by hand and that's why it was so expensive.

305
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:54,130
Speaker 1: there.

306
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:57,410
Speaker 1: You couldn't make a machine to make it efficiently interesting.

307
00:19:57,912 --> 00:20:00,481
Speaker 0: I'm sure we could now if we wanted to but we don't need to.

308
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:01,826
Speaker 0: yeah, I don't know.

309
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:03,292
Speaker 0: probably could anyway You know what?

310
00:20:03,312 --> 00:20:04,117
Speaker 1: You could make you.

311
00:20:04,157 --> 00:20:05,143
Speaker 1: so oh my god.

312
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:06,370
Speaker 1: So, let's see quite a memory.

313
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,075
Speaker 0: Why don't we try to shrink our memory?

314
00:20:08,155 --> 00:20:11,927
Speaker 1: core memory cost about a dollar per bit?

315
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:15,315
Speaker 0: Yeah her Bit.

316
00:20:15,336 --> 00:20:20,386
Speaker 1: Yeah Bit yeah Ten bits.

317
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,735
Speaker 0: Anyway I do so.

318
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:34,868
Speaker 0: you ever watch anime or maybe like a sci-fi movie and at the beginning there's always that villain Given his presentation like thinking like the guy in Robocop given a presentation about like the the evil robot, right?

319
00:20:34,988 --> 00:20:37,695
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, or What's another good example?

320
00:20:37,935 --> 00:20:50,190
Speaker 0: rezo and copy rezo like here's my evil plan and all the magical diagrams of how I'm gonna destroy the world Or whatever I imagine like a Steve Jobs presentation only blatantly evil and obviously selling you a bad thing to the evil military.

321
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:54,290
Speaker 1: You know what like the Steve Jobs parody with the devil and Rick and Morty.

322
00:20:55,152 --> 00:20:56,160
Speaker 0: Sure that I haven't seen okay.

323
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,430
Speaker 1: You should watch Rick and Morty, right?

324
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:02,130
Speaker 0: I mean this, you know, imagine like say like giving a presentation and like the instrumentality project, right?

325
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,117
Speaker 1: You know that gave me an idea for a fun thing.

326
00:21:04,177 --> 00:21:05,784
Speaker 1: I should make say lays PowerPoints.

327
00:21:06,085 --> 00:21:07,410
Speaker 1: Just make that as like an account.

328
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:10,010
Speaker 0: I mean, that's a common trope in movies right now.

329
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:16,670
Speaker 0: You would never think that anywhere on earth would anyone actually give a presentation with that aesthetic.

330
00:21:17,213 --> 00:21:20,370
Speaker 0: That's not a parody or a joke or because they're acting in a movie.

331
00:21:20,831 --> 00:21:23,298
Speaker 0: But in fact that is what happens in this video.

332
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:31,862
Speaker 0: is a man named Lee Su man, right and he is the CEO Head whatever chairman of SM Entertainment.

333
00:21:31,882 --> 00:21:32,505
Speaker 0: I think yes.

334
00:21:32,786 --> 00:21:33,669
Speaker 1: He's the Scorpio.

335
00:21:34,932 --> 00:21:37,690
Speaker 0: It's SM Entertainment because his name is Su man.

336
00:21:38,011 --> 00:21:44,730
Speaker 0: That's why it's SM Entertainment and the slogan of SM Entertainment has always been like the future of culture technology, right?

337
00:21:44,851 --> 00:21:47,170
Speaker 0: Which is really cool slogan of scariness.

338
00:21:47,970 --> 00:22:00,928
Speaker 0: And he gave this presentation recently right which despite being like a company that makes kpop and shit This presentation is basically evil corporation the stereotypical presentation.

339
00:22:00,948 --> 00:22:03,070
Speaker 0: Wow It's so frightening.

340
00:22:03,592 --> 00:22:06,039
Speaker 0: This is why it's like he's showing off like you'd be.

341
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:09,470
Speaker 0: think he's about to demonstrate like his new laser weapon to take over the world.

342
00:22:10,392 --> 00:22:16,390
Speaker 0: When he's talking about like first we train people and then we produce really good music and then we market them.

343
00:22:16,772 --> 00:22:19,370
Speaker 1: It's like that board meeting and kill la kill with the evil company.

344
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,573
Speaker 1: I mean these.

345
00:22:20,754 --> 00:22:31,850
Speaker 0: he's actually presenting this plan whereby he's going to make a kpop group called NCT That exists everywhere in the world and has you know a group in everyone's hometown.

346
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,856
Speaker 1: It's kind of shit that he's gonna deploy.

347
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:42,649
Speaker 0: He's gonna deploy his new culture technology worldwide and at the end of the presentation He has a bunch of people come in wearing masks doing a spooky dance.

348
00:22:43,357 --> 00:22:49,270
Speaker 1: This is the kind of shit you see I'm using on the news in the background at the beginning of an apocalypse movie.

349
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:57,076
Speaker 0: Yeah or these subtitles would be straight out of anime like that or something you see on like a Commercial for a blatantly evil product.

350
00:22:57,176 --> 00:23:05,670
Speaker 1: in total recall I can explain the concept of SM's culture technology CT very easily through our artists development system.

351
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:13,587
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you should just watch this because even if it's the most hilarious But also frightening presentation ever.

352
00:23:13,627 --> 00:23:14,070
Speaker 1: What's with this?

353
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:18,165
Speaker 1: Like say lay look at the graphic read overlay on him.

354
00:23:18,285 --> 00:23:20,339
Speaker 0: The graphics are incredible.

355
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:22,012
Speaker 0: who Did?

356
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:25,002
Speaker 1: there's no way they don't realize that this just looks.

357
00:23:25,062 --> 00:23:26,507
Speaker 0: no he definitely did it on purpose.

358
00:23:26,747 --> 00:23:29,857
Speaker 0: There's no question They're too smart to have done this by accident.

359
00:23:29,877 --> 00:23:33,528
Speaker 1: I mean even Hank Scorpio acted like a normal person around other people.

360
00:23:33,889 --> 00:23:36,341
Speaker 0: Yeah This is like not even hiding it.

361
00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:41,148
Speaker 1: in the moment We are going to be at anime Boston not this weekend, but next weekend.

362
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:44,185
Speaker 1: on Friday We're doing role-playing anime and Jojo anime by its cover.

363
00:23:44,527 --> 00:23:49,070
Speaker 1: on Saturday We're doing how to run an anime club more for an anime openers and still do anime club.

364
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,561
Speaker 0: Why don't we do how to do a panel instead?

365
00:23:50,581 --> 00:23:53,644
Speaker 1: Well, because I got saw Because we did how to do a panel last year.

366
00:23:53,684 --> 00:23:54,470
Speaker 0: I alternate that one.

367
00:23:55,071 --> 00:23:58,607
Speaker 1: That's a gimme because they both fill and people really want to see that kind of content.

368
00:23:58,647 --> 00:24:04,123
Speaker 1: forget everything man I remember pretty well, and I've still been in touch with some people at RIT anime.

369
00:24:04,163 --> 00:24:04,805
Speaker 1: I learned some things.

370
00:24:04,825 --> 00:24:05,307
Speaker 1: Yeah.

371
00:24:05,628 --> 00:24:07,353
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's interesting You know what?

372
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:09,579
Speaker 1: Our advice is still correct.

373
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:10,762
Speaker 0: Sure pretty much.

374
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:17,648
Speaker 1: There's very little that's changed at least at one place yep, but that one place still seems to have like the culture is pure there still.

375
00:24:17,668 --> 00:24:20,114
Speaker 1: and Motivational anime.

376
00:24:20,355 --> 00:24:21,800
Speaker 1: we don't have any panels on Sunday.

377
00:24:21,881 --> 00:24:24,510
Speaker 1: So you want to see us Friday and Saturday?

378
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:28,350
Speaker 1: We're also gonna be at Zank icon the following weekend doing a whole bunch of panels.

379
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:33,584
Speaker 1: Scott might not be but I will be and we're gonna be at PAX East doing.

380
00:24:33,604 --> 00:24:34,146
Speaker 0: I'll be there.

381
00:24:34,387 --> 00:24:40,829
Speaker 1: Atari game design Which actually we've done this panel a couple times now with different Atari games.

382
00:24:41,754 --> 00:24:43,642
Speaker 0: I think it's pretty good and change the games up.

383
00:24:43,662 --> 00:24:45,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're definitely gonna change the games up.

384
00:24:45,531 --> 00:24:56,168
Speaker 1: I feel like maze craze does not need to be talked about and I feel like we need a game That's better than slot racers, but not as good as outlaw to fill like a middle ground.

385
00:24:56,188 --> 00:24:58,036
Speaker 1: Sorry circus That need that.

386
00:24:58,056 --> 00:24:58,760
Speaker 1: that's a paddle game.

387
00:24:59,062 --> 00:25:00,530
Speaker 1: Oh fuck unless you want to buy a knob.

388
00:25:01,311 --> 00:25:02,876
Speaker 1: No, if we get two knobs, no.

389
00:25:03,056 --> 00:25:09,715
Speaker 1: Yeah, we could bring the Atari and tell the enforcer like yeah, we need s video Or just going.

390
00:25:09,876 --> 00:25:13,450
Speaker 0: we have plenty of time before PAX East go on eBay and buy some fucking knobs.

391
00:25:14,094 --> 00:25:16,230
Speaker 1: I need to be able to plug them into a USB port on my laptop.

392
00:25:16,611 --> 00:25:21,670
Speaker 0: You can buy converter from Atari to USB because it's the same thing as Sega Genesis to USB.

393
00:25:22,413 --> 00:25:26,550
Speaker 1: I don't think yeah, but Sega Genesis to USB only works because it's still just buttons.

394
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:27,012
Speaker 1: What'll the?

395
00:25:27,072 --> 00:25:30,143
Speaker 1: what will the rolling analog ish slider do?

396
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:31,990
Speaker 0: it'll convert it mean?

397
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,624
Speaker 0: Well, you have an analog stick on your steam controller, right?

398
00:25:35,764 --> 00:25:42,810
Speaker 0: I do and that connects by USB By talking to the Windows controller API as an analog input.

399
00:25:43,072 --> 00:25:52,590
Speaker 1: I am not confident that if I buy a Sega to USB Adapter and plug a paddle controller from an Atari into it that it will work without me having to do some major fuckery.

400
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:55,326
Speaker 0: I think it'll work and I think it will only cost you like five to ten.

401
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:55,869
Speaker 1: What about money?

402
00:25:56,932 --> 00:26:00,350
Speaker 0: I think you can also find an Atari to jet it - I'm gonna look for it right now.

403
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:01,777
Speaker 0: Tell you what, I will.

404
00:26:01,837 --> 00:26:03,183
Speaker 1: I'll look if there's gotta be.

405
00:26:03,224 --> 00:26:04,490
Speaker 0: this can't be that hard to buy.

406
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:08,790
Speaker 0: I know I just haven't actually actually working paddles though because you might have to buy those as well.

407
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,275
Speaker 1: I do have working paddles.

408
00:26:10,295 --> 00:26:11,559
Speaker 1: That's the one thing I have.

409
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:12,441
Speaker 0: Are they actually good?

410
00:26:12,462 --> 00:26:19,149
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're good enough for kaboom Even though player two is a little bit better than player one, but not that much.

411
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:21,897
Speaker 1: We're gonna save the best for last.

412
00:26:21,917 --> 00:26:25,550
Speaker 1: so we're gonna talk about the go stuff and the rise of the AI last.

413
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:28,359
Speaker 1: So if you're waiting for us to talk about that just stay tuned.

414
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:36,590
Speaker 1: So in other gaming news other than that Xbox Live supposedly now supports cross-platform multiplayer with the ps4.

415
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,834
Speaker 0: Well, it's with everything right.

416
00:26:38,854 --> 00:26:45,290
Speaker 0: supposedly they're adding this and rocket League is gonna be the game that you can play across all three systems.

417
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:50,070
Speaker 0: You're gonna PC people Xbox people and PlayStation people all playing the same game against each other.

418
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:54,890
Speaker 1: So currently if I do matchmaking though cats and dogs, it still only matches me with computer people.

419
00:26:54,930 --> 00:27:01,370
Speaker 1: I can only play with ps4 people if I make like a private group and like join with them What you can play with PlayStation people right now automatically.

420
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:06,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, because before the matchmaking I could play with them anytime I wanted but they never put in the same match as me.

421
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:09,586
Speaker 0: If I just did the magic you turn it off because by default it's your.

422
00:27:09,807 --> 00:27:17,077
Speaker 0: by default You are playing with PlayStation people unless you flick the switch and the options that says don't do that Please change at some point.

423
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:17,721
Speaker 0: you had.

424
00:27:17,943 --> 00:27:19,170
Speaker 0: the default is to play with them.

425
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:21,189
Speaker 0: You would have to check the box to not play with them.

426
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:24,783
Speaker 0: I feel like if that's true you ever see anyone with a with a avatar.

427
00:27:24,803 --> 00:27:25,987
Speaker 0: This is PSY net.

428
00:27:26,329 --> 00:27:28,109
Speaker 0: No Well, you probably turned it off.

429
00:27:28,411 --> 00:27:31,784
Speaker 1: Well, then I'll keep it off because the times I did play with PlayStation people locally.

430
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,129
Speaker 1: PlayStation culture is bad.

431
00:27:33,972 --> 00:27:41,010
Speaker 0: I don't really notice any difference really between the steam people and the PlayStation people because Rocket League is the pretty much the perfect game for for this cross.

432
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,556
Speaker 1: Hey who plays with keyboard and mouse?

433
00:27:42,576 --> 00:27:43,239
Speaker 0: cuz it's control.

434
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:44,986
Speaker 0: It's the same thing across every system.

435
00:27:45,026 --> 00:27:45,407
Speaker 0: controller.

436
00:27:45,447 --> 00:27:47,780
Speaker 0: controller controller It's the same options at the same game.

437
00:27:48,102 --> 00:27:49,530
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter which one you're using.

438
00:27:49,974 --> 00:28:02,563
Speaker 0: So it's like perfect, you know you know they tried this a long time ago when they had that shatter run game for the Xbox 360 and you could play against people on the PC and They disabled that shortly after because the place did the PC.

439
00:28:02,603 --> 00:28:03,766
Speaker 0: people kicked everyone's ass.

440
00:28:03,987 --> 00:28:14,270
Speaker 1: Yep, like the other night I was playing Counter-Strike cuz I've been playing a lot of Counter-Strike lately and there was someone on my team Who was just being really bad, but he acted like he played Counter-Strike for a long time.

441
00:28:14,632 --> 00:28:21,429
Speaker 1: So I finally just watched him playing like spectating Definitely using a controller like I saw him be like.

442
00:28:23,131 --> 00:28:26,666
Speaker 1: So I'm like, dude, are you using a controller?

443
00:28:26,807 --> 00:28:28,844
Speaker 1: and he's like What do you mean?

444
00:28:28,864 --> 00:28:34,147
Speaker 1: and I'm like Are you holding in your hand an Xbox controller or a keyboard and a mouse?

445
00:28:34,408 --> 00:28:39,107
Speaker 1: and he was like How would you use a keyboard and a mouse and then someone else on my team voted to kick?

446
00:28:39,348 --> 00:28:43,485
Speaker 1: Yes Yeah, it was one of the funniest things I've ever seen in my life.

447
00:28:43,525 --> 00:28:48,486
Speaker 1: Yeah Okay, like I regret that I was not streaming that game.

448
00:28:48,988 --> 00:28:59,339
Speaker 0: oh my god Yeah, but no this is.

449
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:11,747
Speaker 1: I'm actually excited for this because rocket league is also one of the best like casual But also serious multiplayer esport games other than video ball in recent history.

450
00:29:12,068 --> 00:29:16,022
Speaker 0: video ball If only you'd come out before rocket league what took you so long?

451
00:29:16,202 --> 00:29:19,294
Speaker 0: video ball where I mean he's at GDC I know right now.

452
00:29:19,555 --> 00:29:20,197
Speaker 0: give it a good talk.

453
00:29:20,237 --> 00:29:21,201
Speaker 0: He's given big hits.

454
00:29:21,362 --> 00:29:23,550
Speaker 0: He's swinging hard and hitting hard.

455
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,904
Speaker 0: I've had three video ball.

456
00:29:24,944 --> 00:29:25,510
Speaker 0: still isn't out.

457
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,413
Speaker 0: So what good are you?

458
00:29:26,493 --> 00:29:31,610
Speaker 1: we're gonna have texted me so far today being like yo dog blah blah blah.

459
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:32,904
Speaker 1: Where are you at GDC?

460
00:29:32,924 --> 00:29:35,516
Speaker 1: And I'm like, no But I got a GDC.

461
00:29:35,536 --> 00:29:37,164
Speaker 0: you want to pay for me to go to GDC.

462
00:29:37,184 --> 00:29:39,686
Speaker 1: It's like a zillion dollars I think I might come in to pay for next year.

463
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,927
Speaker 0: Your Companies like where are we sending you?

464
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:47,395
Speaker 1: Technology conference sure Right.

465
00:29:47,455 --> 00:29:49,486
Speaker 1: I mean they sent me to PAX Australia once.

466
00:29:49,546 --> 00:29:50,190
Speaker 1: so do you want?

467
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:53,428
Speaker 0: I don't know why the game developers keep supporting GDC.

468
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:58,550
Speaker 0: I wish that they would go to PAX dev or just something else and make it not cost a fortune.

469
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:11,183
Speaker 0: Yeah, because honestly because someone who whoever runs GDC is the IGDA or somebody is making big profits off that GDC is more of a Spectacle and Pax dev is more of a no world, but the thing is GDC.

470
00:30:11,224 --> 00:30:13,031
Speaker 0: It's like because the game developer It's.

471
00:30:13,192 --> 00:30:20,540
Speaker 0: it's like the conference itself isn't really providing anything other than it's like we rented the space But because all the developers go to it.

472
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, right there and they make it good.

473
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,356
Speaker 0: It's like the same thing with fucking Gen Con.

474
00:30:25,376 --> 00:30:29,450
Speaker 0: it's like a garbage convention, but because all the tabletop companies go to it.

475
00:30:29,932 --> 00:30:34,030
Speaker 0: It's like well that you have to go there because that's what the tabletop companies are going.

476
00:30:34,493 --> 00:30:37,110
Speaker 0: And if all the tabletop companies would just say fuck you Gen Con.

477
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,234
Speaker 0: We're gonna do something better.

478
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:40,804
Speaker 0: It would be done and it would be amazing.

479
00:30:40,984 --> 00:30:53,318
Speaker 1: meanwhile e3 basically doesn't exist anymore and all the companies are bailing on the e3 and they're either doing nothing or at least haven't said they're doing anything different or They're running their own events now.

480
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:55,005
Speaker 0: EA was like we're gonna set up.

481
00:30:55,025 --> 00:30:56,009
Speaker 0: We're not gonna go into e3.

482
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:59,310
Speaker 0: We're gonna set up something across the street on our own which people do at PAX.

483
00:30:59,932 --> 00:31:04,310
Speaker 0: But they specifically said they're doing it because we don't see value in doing something just for the industry.

484
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:09,470
Speaker 0: We want the public to come in and it's like oh, that's why we're gonna do our own thing across the street.

485
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:10,835
Speaker 0: Yeah We can let everyone in.

486
00:31:10,975 --> 00:31:19,209
Speaker 1: it's interesting because what I see at PAX dev is there's a lot of people who are there Who you know are there to work and the people who aren't there who I try to get there.

487
00:31:19,249 --> 00:31:20,990
Speaker 1: like yo You should really give a talk at dev.

488
00:31:21,452 --> 00:31:31,170
Speaker 1: They don't want to because since it's a private serious business industry thing It doesn't get any play elsewhere and they're actually only going to these conferences for spectacle.

489
00:31:31,511 --> 00:31:37,448
Speaker 0: Oh you saying the developers are going to GDC because the press is allowed to GDC and because that's dev doesn't allow press.

490
00:31:37,749 --> 00:31:39,830
Speaker 0: you see Pax dev I think they're thinking was out.

491
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:40,474
Speaker 0: There's no press.

492
00:31:40,494 --> 00:31:43,972
Speaker 0: developers will come and say all the good shit and they do Opposite.

493
00:31:43,992 --> 00:31:47,624
Speaker 0: the developers are all going to GDC and saying the good shit because there is press.

494
00:31:47,965 --> 00:31:48,547
Speaker 1: I feel it's.

495
00:31:48,627 --> 00:31:53,325
Speaker 1: I feel like there Are people who don't go to things like dev but do go to GDC because they're actually going.

496
00:31:53,346 --> 00:31:55,770
Speaker 1: the reason their company sends them Is to generate press.

497
00:31:56,292 --> 00:32:02,569
Speaker 1: But then there's another kind of person who goes to a thing like dev and wouldn't go to GDC because they want to talk inside baseball.

498
00:32:03,151 --> 00:32:07,482
Speaker 0: Maybe you could have two areas or different days, right?

499
00:32:07,703 --> 00:32:15,342
Speaker 0: You could have secret day and public in public day And media passes would only get you in on public days.

500
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:16,045
Speaker 1: Whoa.

501
00:32:16,105 --> 00:32:20,622
Speaker 1: Yeah for the public areas And I were GDC I take I mean you.

502
00:32:20,722 --> 00:32:22,850
Speaker 0: you could apply that to like every convention, right?

503
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:34,306
Speaker 0: I mean even pretty much every convention we go to no matter what it is even like anime Boston or something has like a press junket where like you have all the guests and you Have or the chairs of the convention and the press go to a panel.

504
00:32:34,326 --> 00:32:35,170
Speaker 0: that's not on the schedule.

505
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:38,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean like we went to the one at PAX years ago.

506
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,876
Speaker 0: I think that was the first PAX East.

507
00:32:39,896 --> 00:32:43,953
Speaker 0: we went to it because our panel was right after it and we were just sitting there Waiting for it to start.

508
00:32:44,013 --> 00:32:50,797
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's like gave in taiko and a few press and they're just asking some bullshit questions And then I asked him what he ate for breakfast.

509
00:32:50,998 --> 00:32:53,386
Speaker 1: that was easily the best question that was asked.

510
00:32:53,828 --> 00:32:56,989
Speaker 0: and yeah Don't think you're missing out by being kept out of these things.

511
00:32:57,972 --> 00:33:01,789
Speaker 0: If there is anything good that happens at them the press is there and they'll write an article.

512
00:33:02,851 --> 00:33:07,310
Speaker 0: Notice, they don't write too many articles about what happens at the press junket because nothing happens.

513
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:09,455
Speaker 1: So I got going.

514
00:33:09,475 --> 00:33:10,520
Speaker 1: you got a list of news over there.

515
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,388
Speaker 0: Yeah, so blizzard, right?

516
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:16,110
Speaker 0: There's some Hearthstone updates coming out But that's not a real big story.

517
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:19,370
Speaker 0: The big story is that for the first time in a bajillion years?

518
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:30,182
Speaker 0: They made a patch to Diablo 2 and then they put a patch for Warcraft 3 and it's like, holy Shit, look at that Passion these old games to make them run.

519
00:33:30,262 --> 00:33:33,177
Speaker 0: on the new windows 16.

520
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:37,546
Speaker 0: You could run Warcraft 3 on new max now straight up that.

521
00:33:38,394 --> 00:33:47,615
Speaker 1: That's amazing for a lot of reasons because while people like you and me Can get old DOS games to run because we know how to use things like DOS box Or we know that GOG exists.

522
00:33:48,017 --> 00:33:50,424
Speaker 0: normal people cannot write in GOG.

523
00:33:50,484 --> 00:33:52,530
Speaker 0: All they do is they usually take the old game.

524
00:33:52,811 --> 00:33:54,838
Speaker 0: They rarely get the source code to the old game.

525
00:33:54,858 --> 00:33:57,949
Speaker 0: They usually is setting it up and configuring it with DOS box.

526
00:33:58,471 --> 00:34:03,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that you can just double-click in you know, GOG galaxy or whatever and game will play.

527
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:06,683
Speaker 1: They fucks with all the business that if I get there's still dogs, but there's still.

528
00:34:07,386 --> 00:34:09,375
Speaker 0: you're still using DOS box A lot of the time right?

529
00:34:09,415 --> 00:34:11,987
Speaker 0: you're very rarely running the game directly on Windows straight up.

530
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:15,690
Speaker 0: But Blizzard they have the source code and all the stuff for their old games.

531
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:22,290
Speaker 0: They can update them and they're doing so I guess to get you to buy them and keep making money off them.

532
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:24,358
Speaker 0: So someone Warcraft 3 isn't free.

533
00:34:24,378 --> 00:34:32,726
Speaker 1: You got to buy that and someone noticed that several months ago Blizzard had a single job posting quote senior software engineer classic games.

534
00:34:33,107 --> 00:34:33,949
Speaker 1: that was then filled.

535
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,138
Speaker 0: So I guess then this happened who it?

536
00:34:36,178 --> 00:34:39,010
Speaker 0: we should ask who this person is and interview them.

537
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:42,562
Speaker 0: Yeah, because they probably don't have a lot of secrets that they can't talk about right?

538
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:43,505
Speaker 0: is you know, they're.

539
00:34:43,686 --> 00:34:51,310
Speaker 0: they've all the Architectures and stories of how these games are made has been well documented in many long-form gaming articles, right?

540
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:54,849
Speaker 0: You know the the saga of how Starcraft was made and all this shit, right?

541
00:34:55,231 --> 00:34:56,469
Speaker 0: But the question is it's like whoa.

542
00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:09,524
Speaker 0: First of all, let's go play these games that we couldn't play easily because they're way good or at least fun for Diablo's case fun once But Warcraft 3 is always fun Yeah, and I can actually play that RTS because it's not ridiculous

543
00:35:09,705 --> 00:35:10,307
Speaker 1: even though

544
00:35:10,327 --> 00:35:13,379
Speaker 0: I'll still lose But I'll lose less bad than it's Starcraft 2.

545
00:35:13,379 --> 00:35:30,450
Speaker 1: if the fact that this happened the way the timing and the way that it did it bodes well for the sort of continuing maturation of games as a significant force of media because This sort of like archival preservation thing has not really happened that much in gaming except in museums.

546
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:33,104
Speaker 0: Well, I mean Nintendo's got the Virtual Console right.

547
00:35:33,144 --> 00:35:34,330
Speaker 0: 20th anniversary of Pokemon.

548
00:35:34,471 --> 00:35:36,566
Speaker 0: They put that Pokemon right on the VC on 3ds, right?

549
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:38,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's you know.

550
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:38,993
Speaker 0: You don't think of it.

551
00:35:39,034 --> 00:35:46,748
Speaker 0: there are a bunch of other think of it the same way because it's not like a patch to make Something up-to-date even though they did patch it to make it up-to-date a patch it to make it work on the 3ds.

552
00:35:47,653 --> 00:35:49,503
Speaker 0: They just don't sell it that way.

553
00:35:49,544 --> 00:35:50,610
Speaker 0: so you don't think of it the same way.

554
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:57,301
Speaker 1: But think about how many Nintendo games over the years have just disappeared Yep, except in ROM libraries that people run in Nestle or whatever.

555
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:57,502
Speaker 0: Right?

556
00:35:57,522 --> 00:36:00,190
Speaker 0: Well, I mean those things can be easily emulated, right?

557
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:07,350
Speaker 0: But PC games are actually rather difficult to emulate for a wide variety of reasons, right?

558
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:15,200
Speaker 0: Because you know, especially like let's say you get some old, you know a PC game and it's like, oh, yeah This one only has real sound on an ad-lib.

559
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,290
Speaker 0: It doesn't have real sound on a sound blaster.

560
00:36:17,531 --> 00:36:19,842
Speaker 1: Yeah, do you know about DMAs and IRQs?

561
00:36:20,224 --> 00:36:23,795
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you don't And you don't need to like.

562
00:36:23,855 --> 00:36:25,222
Speaker 1: it's stupid to know about this game.

563
00:36:25,242 --> 00:36:27,090
Speaker 0: This game was programmed poorly.

564
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:32,070
Speaker 0: So it's expecting to run in a 286. if you run it on a 386 or faster, it'll go really fast.

565
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:34,060
Speaker 1: Whoa dog, 100 megahertz.

566
00:36:34,141 --> 00:36:35,226
Speaker 1: That's that's a bit much.

567
00:36:35,287 --> 00:36:40,930
Speaker 0: I had a 100 I had a 100 megahertz computer and it was a 486 and some games did not work on it.

568
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:41,915
Speaker 0: And that was Iran.

569
00:36:41,935 --> 00:36:43,182
Speaker 0: who's running PC DOS.

570
00:36:43,363 --> 00:36:44,610
Speaker 0: Oh, but no you gotta run MS-DOS.

571
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:48,580
Speaker 1: So twitch has done two interesting things.

572
00:36:49,101 --> 00:36:49,262
Speaker 1: one.

573
00:36:49,663 --> 00:36:51,830
Speaker 1: They're streaming Julia Child's cooking show.

574
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:56,090
Speaker 0: Well, that's sort of after the success of their you know, painting show.

575
00:36:56,831 --> 00:36:58,216
Speaker 0: Right, you know, they're dead.

576
00:36:58,236 --> 00:36:59,099
Speaker 1: I watched a bunch of that.

577
00:36:59,139 --> 00:36:59,902
Speaker 1: That was good business.

578
00:37:00,062 --> 00:37:08,261
Speaker 0: Of course, right after they saw those successful They went out obviously to look for Equivalent things and they stayed in the PBS library.

579
00:37:08,482 --> 00:37:08,964
Speaker 0: I hope they do.

580
00:37:09,004 --> 00:37:09,224
Speaker 0: Mr.

581
00:37:09,264 --> 00:37:09,605
Speaker 0: Rogers.

582
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:10,970
Speaker 1: So I recall a time.

583
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:17,470
Speaker 1: Mr Rogers, I recall a time not that get him out here when twitch basically banned all non gaming content.

584
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,050
Speaker 0: It's a beautiful day in the twitch neighborhood.

585
00:37:19,291 --> 00:37:32,967
Speaker 1: I also remember a time not that long ago where if Content that wasn't literally screen capture of a game appeared on Twitch and Anyone started watching it half the chat stream was what is this RL bullshit?

586
00:37:32,987 --> 00:37:33,429
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

587
00:37:34,534 --> 00:37:36,784
Speaker 0: Well, unless somebody was like streaming my little pony.

588
00:37:36,824 --> 00:37:48,150
Speaker 1: Yeah But it's interesting that I think the main reason twitch did these two things and why they're doing more things like this Is that being a hundred percent gaming only focused?

589
00:37:49,091 --> 00:37:57,058
Speaker 1: They were set to lose out to YouTube because YouTube was just the same gaming stuff plus Literally any other kind of content in the world.

590
00:37:57,138 --> 00:37:59,305
Speaker 0: YouTube gaming is not doing that.

591
00:37:59,365 --> 00:38:01,214
Speaker 0: Well, people are still on Twitch Really?

592
00:38:01,254 --> 00:38:03,130
Speaker 0: They haven't built the community at YouTube gaming.

593
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:14,050
Speaker 1: That's interesting because I don't interact with the community and if you don't interact with the community and you just want to use the service To watch YouTube is just technologically superior by a huge margin like watching twitch streams.

594
00:38:14,211 --> 00:38:19,730
Speaker 1: Not that great because for a lot of reasons that don't want to really get into now, but it doesn't work that great.

595
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:20,492
Speaker 1: yeah, you do.

596
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:27,502
Speaker 0: only the main problems with the YouTube one is that if Is the there's a limitation that people aren't aware of.

597
00:38:27,582 --> 00:38:29,130
Speaker 0: it can only be so long, right?

598
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:39,350
Speaker 0: I did a YouTube game stream once and that like it cut off at 12 hours and I did another one and The encoding like never worked and the video is not there, right?

599
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,230
Speaker 0: So it's like it's buggy in that sense.

600
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:45,830
Speaker 0: But but like the actual way you stream and watching the stream is just better in fact.

601
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,779
Speaker 1: so I've been playing with you.

602
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:52,890
Speaker 1: guys might have watched me play counter-strike the other day and What's interesting is in the second half of that video?

603
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:56,141
Speaker 1: I was basically neo god among men walking around as a murder machine.

604
00:38:56,482 --> 00:39:02,785
Speaker 1: But aside from that the Shadowplay, you know the thing where you basically have impact free streaming.

605
00:39:03,046 --> 00:39:06,301
Speaker 1: if you have an Nvidia card One it used to only work with twitch.

606
00:39:06,864 --> 00:39:12,150
Speaker 1: if you install the beta New version like you have to enable the beta and then download the beta and run the beta.

607
00:39:13,231 --> 00:39:14,736
Speaker 1: It can also stream to YouTube.

608
00:39:15,117 --> 00:39:17,083
Speaker 0: Did that force you to update your Nvidia driver?

609
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:19,390
Speaker 0: Uh, yes, that makes it five crash.

610
00:39:20,631 --> 00:39:23,074
Speaker 1: Yes, actually How I fixed it.

611
00:39:23,958 --> 00:39:36,540
Speaker 1: if you start the game through the Nvidia experience It always works really so and apparently a lot of people have pointed out that if you ever run into a game where one of The Nvidia patches breaks it I mean a later patch will probably obviously fix it.

612
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,990
Speaker 1: but they almost always work fine.

613
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:46,670
Speaker 1: If you open the Nvidia like game tuning experience and click a launch game from there This has worked a hundred percent for me, which is really interesting.

614
00:39:46,831 --> 00:39:49,563
Speaker 0: But if you'd open up sieve from steam, it just doesn't even start.

615
00:39:49,724 --> 00:39:49,945
Speaker 1: Yep.

616
00:39:50,567 --> 00:39:54,849
Speaker 0: All right Maybe now that I know that maybe I'll update my driver because I've been keeping my driver old.

617
00:39:55,191 --> 00:40:01,610
Speaker 1: I was also a problem, but let me tell you the shadow cast YouTube again way better.

618
00:40:01,811 --> 00:40:06,509
Speaker 1: I can send as many megabits per second as I fucking want as long as I got a pipe for it.

619
00:40:06,831 --> 00:40:08,879
Speaker 1: Not like twitch limiting you to three or six or whatever.

620
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:11,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I tried a 12 megabit per second stream.

621
00:40:11,931 --> 00:40:15,342
Speaker 1: I tried streaming like 10 like giant resolutions.

622
00:40:15,803 --> 00:40:17,208
Speaker 1: It all worked pretty much fine.

623
00:40:17,228 --> 00:40:27,930
Speaker 1: It was kind of cool Mmm, the other thing that it was interesting is it didn't have any options for like setting voice volume Or like any of that fiddly stuff you do in like OBS or like even X split.

624
00:40:28,754 --> 00:40:30,088
Speaker 1: So I was like, I wonder if this will work.

625
00:40:30,953 --> 00:40:32,270
Speaker 1: They just has intelligent defaults.

626
00:40:32,573 --> 00:40:40,656
Speaker 1: It just figures out like, you know We did knows you're gonna have game audio and knows you're gonna have talking audio and it just handles it Mmm and makes it sound great.

627
00:40:40,937 --> 00:40:42,904
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was shocked by how I'm.

628
00:40:42,924 --> 00:40:44,610
Speaker 0: can you get your webcam in the shot or whatever?

629
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:59,295
Speaker 1: Yes, actually, I didn't try that because I might have not been dressed when I was playing Counter-Strike, but Okay, yeah, but the other news is that another thing twitch is doing is they have announced What do they call it stream first?

630
00:40:59,315 --> 00:41:04,110
Speaker 1: All right, it is an initiative to work with developers designing new games.

631
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:09,790
Speaker 1: So people are currently making games to integrate streaming into their platforms from day one.

632
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:14,870
Speaker 0: That's something they tried before right but they sort of backed off on that.

633
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:19,210
Speaker 0: Like I saw a whole bunch of this especially like around the time the ps4 was coming out.

634
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:25,377
Speaker 0: Yeah, like games that like included twitch is part of the game like in the game you could push a button and start streaming to twitch.

635
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:30,674
Speaker 0: and then I thought like eventually every game was just gonna have this and It didn't happen.

636
00:41:30,694 --> 00:41:32,180
Speaker 0: and I'm like, well, why didn't that happen?

637
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:34,490
Speaker 0: And then I guess now they're gonna try again, but it's twofold.

638
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,755
Speaker 0: It's not just what.

639
00:41:35,775 --> 00:41:37,001
Speaker 0: YouTube should try the same thing.

640
00:41:37,021 --> 00:41:37,523
Speaker 0: Yeah, they should.

641
00:41:37,563 --> 00:41:39,210
Speaker 1: it's not just integrated into the game to make streaming.

642
00:41:39,231 --> 00:41:46,025
Speaker 0: You should also Somebody should make a service to where you can send your RT MPs to one place and have them go to both YouTube and twitch at the same time.

643
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:50,060
Speaker 1: That's the kind of company that either YouTube or twitch would buy.

644
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:55,260
Speaker 0: you can do it yourself by starting up a little server and using Something like VLC even or something to go between.

645
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,550
Speaker 1: I think there's even an nginx plug-in that you can use those.

646
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:00,323
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, but nginx is sort of a weird thing to use.

647
00:42:00,383 --> 00:42:03,530
Speaker 0: Yeah web server Why would you use it to proxy the anyway?

648
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:09,463
Speaker 1: But so after after a certain unnamed convention where someone wanted to use it for that I've discovered that actually a lot of people use it for that.

649
00:42:09,926 --> 00:42:11,134
Speaker 0: It's a web server It's not.

650
00:42:11,255 --> 00:42:12,869
Speaker 0: it's not a video streaming process.

651
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:17,110
Speaker 1: You're not gonna believe this but a lot of people are using JavaScript for both front end and back end coding.

652
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,769
Speaker 0: You don't say that you don't say.

653
00:42:19,951 --> 00:42:21,457
Speaker 1: But it's more than that.

654
00:42:21,477 --> 00:42:31,292
Speaker 1: this is also an initiative to allow two-way communication so the game can be dynamic based on events in the Making.

655
00:42:31,312 --> 00:42:35,747
Speaker 1: twitch plays Pokemon something that you can use an API to do easily and officially.

656
00:42:35,767 --> 00:42:41,509
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm That is something that I don't think YouTube could move on with any speed.

657
00:42:42,131 --> 00:42:42,854
Speaker 0: YouTube could do that.

658
00:42:43,115 --> 00:42:44,519
Speaker 1: They won't not with any speed.

659
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:47,950
Speaker 0: YouTube chat should be available by the YouTube API because they're just comments or whatever.

660
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:48,901
Speaker 1: It's not just chat.

661
00:42:48,922 --> 00:42:49,610
Speaker 1: They want to go further than that.

662
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:58,004
Speaker 1: They want to make it easy to have real game experiences like deep integrations down the road Like what like maybe even share a controller straight up with someone.

663
00:42:58,526 --> 00:43:06,070
Speaker 0: so I go on YouTube I go on Twitch and there's a game being played and I'm watching it and I take out my controller and I start playing.

664
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:10,250
Speaker 0: the Game that I'm seeing a stream of is delayed by at least 30 seconds to a few minutes.

665
00:43:10,411 --> 00:43:14,890
Speaker 1: So obviously there are a lot of things they still need to work out and this is just an initiative to work with developers.

666
00:43:15,272 --> 00:43:16,016
Speaker 1: It appears that there's.

667
00:43:16,117 --> 00:43:23,590
Speaker 1: they're starting the focus with simple Interactions that are delay friendly like typing something that in a vote and those kinds of things.

668
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:36,708
Speaker 0: So it's so a little thing shows up in twitch and I interact with it and then event click to vote he-man or minotaur And then eventually that whatever we happens affects what the person playing the game Yeah deals with.

669
00:43:37,211 --> 00:43:56,187
Speaker 1: So the end game though because there's a feature in the nvd experience shadowcast beta stuff that I didn't look at too closely But it basically let me share an interface where someone on the internet could watch my stream and Connect to my game with a controller to play effectively local co-op with me from the game.

670
00:43:56,368 --> 00:43:57,591
Speaker 1: I'm running Mm-hmm.

671
00:43:58,051 --> 00:44:03,359
Speaker 1: I did not investigate that further, but I will at some point for probably for the next Tuesday's show.

672
00:44:03,379 --> 00:44:03,779
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

673
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:11,938
Speaker 1: So twitch is definitely trying to do things to stay ahead of the game with YouTube because you're right They're still dominant.

674
00:44:11,959 --> 00:44:14,955
Speaker 0: Well ever since Amazon bought them They have the resources to do stuff like.

675
00:44:15,055 --> 00:44:23,681
Speaker 1: buy TV show like this is right, but they have the benefit of focusing primarily on gaming But they also have the drawback of they don't have the like.

676
00:44:23,742 --> 00:44:26,470
Speaker 1: we literally will appeal to any streaming content of YouTube.

677
00:44:27,155 --> 00:44:29,130
Speaker 1: So we'll see how this all shakes down in the long run.

678
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:29,429
Speaker 0: All right.

679
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:39,337
Speaker 0: So there was a product called the 2600 - daptor and the original version supported both paddles And the joystick.

680
00:44:39,658 --> 00:44:56,925
Speaker 0: the new version the two hundred twenty six hundred daptor two supports paddles joysticks 7800 controllers the calculator thing that sort of joystick with two buttons thing the trackball The star Raider thingy and the because our panel is has a lot going for it.

681
00:44:57,266 --> 00:45:07,298
Speaker 1: if we're standing there with legit Atari 2600 controllers that will add a plus or twenty six hundred daptor two Units on hand two for 57 bucks.

682
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:12,133
Speaker 0: Well, that's more expensive than I thought but I think you might only need one to do two Paddles.

683
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:14,450
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, cuz there are two paddles per plug.

684
00:45:14,631 --> 00:45:18,149
Speaker 1: But if we want to do warlords, we need two of them because we need four paddles.

685
00:45:19,551 --> 00:45:24,250
Speaker 0: You know what warlords not actually that good warlords is so good.

686
00:45:24,611 --> 00:45:25,514
Speaker 1: The concept is good.

687
00:45:25,554 --> 00:45:30,310
Speaker 0: if you played it recently on the Atari 2600 the resolution being low is a problem.

688
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:31,815
Speaker 1: There are other problems with that game.

689
00:45:31,876 --> 00:45:32,578
Speaker 1: that that's another.

690
00:45:32,598 --> 00:45:34,947
Speaker 0: the angles not being highly varied is a problem.

691
00:45:35,007 --> 00:45:39,929
Speaker 1: that game Remade intelligently could be the next video ball.

692
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:41,834
Speaker 0: It's called video ball.

693
00:45:41,975 --> 00:45:43,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just video.

694
00:45:43,501 --> 00:45:45,810
Speaker 0: There's also selling six-foot USB cables for two bucks.

695
00:45:46,616 --> 00:45:48,050
Speaker 1: I don't think I need a six-foot USB cable.

696
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:53,591
Speaker 0: Also, if you're not interested in using any of those weird like a trackball you get the original 2600 daptor two for 48.

697
00:45:53,591 --> 00:46:00,273
Speaker 0: That's not much cheaper anyway, so 400 bucks.

698
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:09,223
Speaker 0: Whatever what's I still don't believe any of these VR is gonna succeed because they're all.

699
00:46:09,243 --> 00:46:11,470
Speaker 1: you have a fucked up definition of succeed.

700
00:46:11,912 --> 00:46:15,150
Speaker 1: These are going to succeed in the same way that ultra high-end video cards do same way.

701
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:18,120
Speaker 1: They call the Kinect succeeded way better than the Kinect.

702
00:46:18,301 --> 00:46:19,324
Speaker 0: then we the wiimote.

703
00:46:19,424 --> 00:46:23,269
Speaker 1: more people buy like Nvidia 980s than by Kinect.

704
00:46:24,832 --> 00:46:27,784
Speaker 1: We moats the original wiimote that succeeded.

705
00:46:28,507 --> 00:46:29,270
Speaker 0: NES power pad.

706
00:46:30,193 --> 00:46:31,760
Speaker 1: The power pad was ahead of its target.

707
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:36,196
Speaker 1: our globe power glove was ahead of its time Ahead of its time.

708
00:46:36,236 --> 00:46:39,190
Speaker 0: still it was ahead of its time in the 90s and it's still ahead of its time.

709
00:46:39,391 --> 00:46:46,130
Speaker 1: I disagree because if you have that amount of disposable income and you're a hot VR hobbyist this technology is here.

710
00:46:46,294 --> 00:46:50,314
Speaker 1: It's great but for mom and Mainstream and sure.

711
00:46:50,334 --> 00:46:54,653
Speaker 0: so all these hobbyists will buy one just like all the people have 3d printers right now We'll buy one.

712
00:46:54,693 --> 00:46:56,282
Speaker 0: that's I think that's about the level it can get to.

713
00:46:56,362 --> 00:46:59,779
Speaker 0: is where 3d printers are now Which is so widely deployed among hobbyists.

714
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:01,486
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is not so great.

715
00:47:01,607 --> 00:47:05,359
Speaker 0: That's Scott It's not something that you could economically Scott make a large.

716
00:47:05,379 --> 00:47:08,368
Speaker 1: video games used to be widely deployed only among hobbyists.

717
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:10,211
Speaker 1: It took a while Sure.

718
00:47:10,552 --> 00:47:12,197
Speaker 0: It's not something that you could.

719
00:47:12,258 --> 00:47:13,161
Speaker 0: it's not at the point.

720
00:47:13,201 --> 00:47:15,689
Speaker 0: See success is when enough people have it.

721
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:26,710
Speaker 0: It's worthwhile to for a video game hardware device where it's worthwhile to Spend a large budget making a game for it, right?

722
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:33,716
Speaker 0: So a lot of indie devs are making games of this because it's fun and because it's cool or because you know Demos and whatever.

723
00:47:33,856 --> 00:47:36,970
Speaker 1: that is the only way to incubate the next generation.

724
00:47:37,251 --> 00:47:41,350
Speaker 0: No, like company is gonna make like, you know Madden or anything for this, right?

725
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:44,771
Speaker 0: Because there just aren't enough people even if everyone who has one buys your game It's like.

726
00:47:44,791 --> 00:47:47,850
Speaker 0: that wasn't enough to justify the cost of making this game and that's fine.

727
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:53,410
Speaker 1: You need a. this is the first VR platform that is viable to incubate the next generation of VR games.

728
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:54,495
Speaker 1: We've never had that before.

729
00:47:54,797 --> 00:47:57,410
Speaker 1: the last time VR got big one of the big limitations was that one.

730
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,223
Speaker 1: There was no way to deploy it in homes at all.

731
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:01,590
Speaker 1: There couldn't be an indie scene.

732
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:03,920
Speaker 1: It was too expensive too big too horrible.

733
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:04,483
Speaker 1: Now.

734
00:48:04,523 --> 00:48:08,720
Speaker 1: You can actually deploy it widely and People eat while it is very expensive.

735
00:48:09,222 --> 00:48:10,710
Speaker 1: It is very cheap.

736
00:48:11,111 --> 00:48:22,097
Speaker 0: If you're a hobbyist, it's still a giant thing to stick on your face - it'll always be that no But eventually it'll be just like sunglasses or contact lenses or like a tiny little thing Then replacement eyeballs.

737
00:48:22,297 --> 00:48:34,619
Speaker 0: Yes, eventually when it gets to slightly when it gets to like Ski goggle level instead, you know, it's not it's not that much bigger than my ski goggles It's got to be at least maybe swim goggle.

738
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,790
Speaker 1: Have you worn and used the current generation?

739
00:48:37,412 --> 00:48:40,420
Speaker 0: Oculus it is vastly superior to previous ones.

740
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,010
Speaker 0: Yes technology is getting better, but it's still not good enough.

741
00:48:44,111 --> 00:48:45,538
Speaker 0: It's too big and uncomfortable.

742
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,610
Speaker 0: This is actually for long periods of time.

743
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:49,996
Speaker 1: The thing is I think it's being.

744
00:48:50,096 --> 00:48:57,108
Speaker 1: it is successful and continue to be successful, but I'm not super confident in the PlayStation VR.

745
00:48:57,892 --> 00:49:07,930
Speaker 0: Because I mean I mean I mean if you're gonna assume right forget about the argument about all the VR being Unsuccessful, right if you're gonna bet on a VR you bet on the oculus one.

746
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:11,841
Speaker 0: Right all these other ones the valve one and the Sony one.

747
00:49:11,881 --> 00:49:12,803
Speaker 0: It's like get that shit.

748
00:49:13,064 --> 00:49:15,270
Speaker 0: I think it's not going anywhere.

749
00:49:15,611 --> 00:49:21,974
Speaker 1: I think the first good big games like the big ones are gonna come out of valve because they'll understand how to use the Technology.

750
00:49:22,075 --> 00:49:25,492
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I think those games are gonna run on the Right.

751
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:35,570
Speaker 0: and yeah, whatever the vibes and whatever the garbage is out there Samsung nonsense all that shit is gonna be the hollow Basically fake, but that is that stuff is garbage.

752
00:49:35,791 --> 00:49:43,496
Speaker 1: But while I disagree with most of what you were saying before the one thing I do agree with is that fully mainstream Gamer culture.

753
00:49:43,516 --> 00:49:44,825
Speaker 1: It's not quite there yet.

754
00:49:44,845 --> 00:50:03,550
Speaker 1: I Think the PlayStation VR will not be a great experience because people will buy that It costs as much as a game console, but they'll expect the big games you're talking about while the people who buy the oculus on a computer Understand and expect that it's an emergent incubating environment.

755
00:50:04,313 --> 00:50:09,270
Speaker 1: So the oculus person buys an oculus gets exactly what they expected and are amazed by it.

756
00:50:09,752 --> 00:50:13,249
Speaker 1: The kid who buys the PlayStation VR is gonna be real disappointed with it.

757
00:50:14,132 --> 00:50:15,335
Speaker 0: And you want to hear air I'll give you.

758
00:50:15,376 --> 00:50:16,780
Speaker 0: I'll give you a positive right?

759
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:31,950
Speaker 0: This is unlikely to happen, but it is one for non unrealistic future right in which they do make Badass really amazing games for the VR that everyone needs to play right say counter-strike or whatever, right?

760
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:36,113
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it becomes such that like to play counter-strike E-sport.

761
00:50:36,193 --> 00:50:37,679
Speaker 0: for reals you need to have the VR.

762
00:50:37,719 --> 00:50:40,430
Speaker 0: you can't be counter-striking with a monitor anymore, right?

763
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:45,630
Speaker 0: It's at that point for certain games Right and obviously not everyone gonna be doing that at home, right?

764
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:49,970
Speaker 0: You know the people who are eSports champions will be because probably they'll just get one from their sponsors or whatever.

765
00:50:50,392 --> 00:50:56,094
Speaker 0: But most people will still have monitors for a very long time at least five ten Maybe even more than that.

766
00:50:56,134 --> 00:50:58,240
Speaker 0: years right even if monitors become way better.

767
00:50:59,163 --> 00:51:06,666
Speaker 0: it could and I hope this happens Bring back the net cafe or at least make the net cafe exist in the US.

768
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:09,434
Speaker 1: Oh, I can't afford Arcade.

769
00:51:09,474 --> 00:51:12,045
Speaker 0: it's like if you want to play Street Fighter.

770
00:51:12,145 --> 00:51:14,724
Speaker 0: It's like nowadays You love sticks in their home but like.

771
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:22,715
Speaker 0: imagine if the only real way to play certain games that were super important was to go and use VR and You can't afford it.

772
00:51:22,775 --> 00:51:24,060
Speaker 0: so everyone starts good.

773
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,250
Speaker 0: we open up net cafes in the US for real.

774
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:31,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, mostly because we also have the declining prices of commercial retail real estate.

775
00:51:31,531 --> 00:51:37,527
Speaker 1: Also, there is no better way to massively increase the incidence of pink eye among gamers in the United States.

776
00:51:37,648 --> 00:51:38,309
Speaker 0: That is correct.

777
00:51:40,491 --> 00:52:00,730
Speaker 0: So I could see for example in countries that already have net cafes so like a Japan, right It's some net cafe in Japan might be putting an oculus in every one of the little boobs Right, and that's totally realistic And that could be a way that it sees, you know more immediate success, even if it's not in the home.

778
00:52:01,211 --> 00:52:05,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, partly because one of the problems with the more mainstream audience is kind of like with the Nintendo Wii controller.

779
00:52:05,652 --> 00:52:06,629
Speaker 1: There's an article about this.

780
00:52:06,731 --> 00:52:17,423
Speaker 0: In fact, if I was gonna make a VR game I would target it at the person who's in a net cafe in some other country because you want an open space that Is well controlled to do VR.

781
00:52:17,483 --> 00:52:25,943
Speaker 0: and if I was making VR hardware I would get salespeople in those countries to start going around to the companies that run the net cafes and be like look Buy one of these for every booth $400 a booth.

782
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:33,888
Speaker 0: But that or maybe you know, put them in half your booths and charge more for those booths or something You know as a premium to pay for it something like that.

783
00:52:34,653 --> 00:52:42,182
Speaker 1: So last and not least AlphaGo Defeated the human four to one four out of five times.

784
00:52:42,302 --> 00:52:44,008
Speaker 1: Yeah, the human won one game.

785
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:48,949
Speaker 0: Okay, so I don't know how much of the fundamental information you want to go over here.

786
00:52:49,511 --> 00:52:52,142
Speaker 1: But they feel like we could do a whole show on this in general.

787
00:52:52,222 --> 00:52:54,310
Speaker 0: But yeah, so it's playing go, right?

788
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:58,634
Speaker 0: So you already know go is a perfect information game Just like chess.

789
00:52:58,934 --> 00:53:07,985
Speaker 0: the reason that computers can play chess a lot easier before they could play go is because the space of chess The number of possible board positions was much fewer.

790
00:53:08,005 --> 00:53:14,387
Speaker 0: That's not Diminishing the number of possible board positions in chess because there's a fuck ton of them.

791
00:53:14,708 --> 00:53:19,741
Speaker 0: There's just Exponentially orders of magnitude more board positions in go.

792
00:53:19,902 --> 00:53:20,965
Speaker 1: so it's big.

793
00:53:20,985 --> 00:53:22,610
Speaker 1: go is so much more.

794
00:53:22,851 --> 00:53:36,259
Speaker 0: I think the the analogy I gave because we talked about this in some of our lectures the number of board positions in Like in a chess board with I don't know if this is these numbers are close in Actual in actuality but relatively right.

795
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:39,350
Speaker 0: we'd be like comparing the number of atoms in the Sun.

796
00:53:39,631 --> 00:53:46,179
Speaker 0: We'd be like the number of board business in chess and the number of board positions in go Like the number of atoms in the universe.

797
00:53:46,219 --> 00:53:50,337
Speaker 0: actually maybe more maybe more maybe more Right.

798
00:53:50,417 --> 00:53:51,407
Speaker 0: It's like that's the.

799
00:53:51,427 --> 00:54:05,120
Speaker 0: so computers are able to do well at chess because we could have a database of every of almost every chess board position and The best possible move to do from that position and then just do a lookup and make a move.

800
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,344
Speaker 1: But even so think of it this way.

801
00:54:06,465 --> 00:54:15,834
Speaker 0: checkers was weakly mathematically solved after a decade-long Supercomputer checkers, which would be like the number of atoms in the ocean.

802
00:54:15,954 --> 00:54:18,000
Speaker 1: chess is by no means solved.

803
00:54:18,281 --> 00:54:21,231
Speaker 1: We just have clever a eyes mostly with these lookup tape.

804
00:54:21,251 --> 00:54:23,920
Speaker 0: They have most of the you know, most common positions.

805
00:54:24,041 --> 00:54:25,972
Speaker 0: So you rarely you're gonna confuse the chess pro.

806
00:54:25,992 --> 00:54:27,260
Speaker 1: So the chess programs?

807
00:54:27,682 --> 00:54:31,457
Speaker 1: I've not solved chess, but they will beat any human ever no matter what.

808
00:54:31,578 --> 00:54:38,580
Speaker 0: pretty much I think the days of the days of people beating a chess AI at chess are pretty much over.

809
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:45,510
Speaker 0: Yeah But when you're the last big the best the best chess players on earth right now Basically are just people who can do what the computer does.

810
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:50,971
Speaker 1: and there's a lot of cool stuff about how it kind of ruined chess because people are doing things that the computer.

811
00:54:50,991 --> 00:54:57,260
Speaker 0: the last time I watched pro chess the commentators had the computer and it told them this move and they looked at that move and they started talking about how.

812
00:54:57,341 --> 00:54:59,677
Speaker 0: Whoa, that's a crazy move that no one ever think of.

813
00:54:59,717 --> 00:55:05,616
Speaker 0: and I mean It's a lot easier to see chess Even if you're not a pro and I guess chess has at least a few heuristics of right the king.

814
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:06,660
Speaker 0: and I saw the move.

815
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:07,102
Speaker 0: It didn't know.

816
00:55:07,122 --> 00:55:08,609
Speaker 0: like whoa, what an amazing move.

817
00:55:08,629 --> 00:55:10,820
Speaker 0: and they're like, yeah, no person would ever think to do this.

818
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,024
Speaker 0: They're like, is he gonna see it?

819
00:55:12,084 --> 00:55:15,838
Speaker 0: and this guy's sitting there thinking for a long time and eventually he does that move.

820
00:55:15,898 --> 00:55:23,280
Speaker 0: and it's like Before that period of time where computers existed no human would have done that move right just thinking about it looking at it.

821
00:55:23,541 --> 00:55:28,296
Speaker 1: So the takeaways are one the computer did not solve go not even.

822
00:55:28,316 --> 00:55:29,540
Speaker 0: I mean we still haven't solved chess.

823
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:30,707
Speaker 0: We definitely haven't solved go.

824
00:55:30,787 --> 00:55:31,954
Speaker 1: we may never solve go.

825
00:55:32,035 --> 00:55:35,715
Speaker 1: it might not be Solvable in the unit without a quantum computer.

826
00:55:35,755 --> 00:55:36,700
Speaker 0: I don't think it's possible.

827
00:55:36,801 --> 00:55:38,720
Speaker 0: Yeah with one it might not even be possible.

828
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:50,780
Speaker 1: but the important thing for him from a game perspective is that this AI is So far ahead of what even futurists were predicting that I was kind of taken aback that this happened.

829
00:55:51,121 --> 00:55:56,039
Speaker 1: Like when they announced this I was hoping the I would win but I didn't really think it would.

830
00:55:56,059 --> 00:55:56,139
Speaker 0: well.

831
00:55:56,420 --> 00:56:05,703
Speaker 0: so I mean I. we've been talking about machine learning stuff a lot and we keep seeing it's like it's really hot lately and You know, it's been doing so well It's so many things.

832
00:56:05,763 --> 00:56:19,026
Speaker 0: and when they finally said we you know, we've got a thing using this tech these techniques It's gonna play go it's gonna play again It's ready to play against like the one of the top players ever Right and They were willing to like make a show of it.

833
00:56:19,107 --> 00:56:21,294
Speaker 0: and I'm like they must think it's gonna win.

834
00:56:21,876 --> 00:56:24,468
Speaker 0: and there's been so much machine Learning like positives lately.

835
00:56:24,528 --> 00:56:26,640
Speaker 0: I'm like, I think it's gonna win.

836
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:31,782
Speaker 0: It's like I almost couldn't believe that it was gonna win but like even before the first match It's like.

837
00:56:32,103 --> 00:56:32,424
Speaker 0: I'm like.

838
00:56:32,544 --> 00:56:33,106
Speaker 0: I felt like.

839
00:56:33,467 --> 00:56:33,728
Speaker 0: I'm like.

840
00:56:33,788 --> 00:56:35,374
Speaker 0: I'm like, oh the computer's gonna win.

841
00:56:35,394 --> 00:56:37,160
Speaker 0: and then I'm like what the fuck am I saying?

842
00:56:38,401 --> 00:56:39,424
Speaker 0: Gonna win it go.

843
00:56:39,444 --> 00:56:39,985
Speaker 0: Oh, right.

844
00:56:40,046 --> 00:56:41,450
Speaker 0: It's like ludicrously impossible.

845
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:42,694
Speaker 0: and then it like destroyed him.

846
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,599
Speaker 0: and I'm like, well, there it is.

847
00:56:44,961 --> 00:56:56,941
Speaker 1: But it was so in terms that advancement it was as recently as January like it was in January In fact that we even as humans were able to figure out how many possible legal positions there are in 19 by 19.

848
00:56:56,941 --> 00:57:11,440
Speaker 0: Go right this like we've shown Figured that an earlier version of this same program played against someone who is not as good but really really good and in matches That weren't you know, highly publicized and it played about as well as like a good amateur player.

849
00:57:11,521 --> 00:57:14,160
Speaker 0: So it played really well, but not as well as it played now.

850
00:57:14,503 --> 00:57:15,940
Speaker 0: They gave it an honorary.

851
00:57:16,665 --> 00:57:18,560
Speaker 0: Right nine rank, right?

852
00:57:19,101 --> 00:57:26,867
Speaker 0: No person has ever honorarily received which is the highest rank and go by the way, which means that you play Divinely, right?

853
00:57:27,148 --> 00:57:45,760
Speaker 0: So they basically without having to go through the rank up system but I mean Right Right without ever having to like rank up and and you know You know start at the bottom and work its way to the top this computer played against someone who had that rank.

854
00:57:46,201 --> 00:57:47,806
Speaker 0: It beat him four out of five times.

855
00:57:48,167 --> 00:57:51,337
Speaker 0: the Korean go organization basically just gave an honorary.

856
00:57:51,357 --> 00:57:53,142
Speaker 0: They're just like, alright Like.

857
00:57:53,162 --> 00:57:54,426
Speaker 1: imagine if I walked into.

858
00:57:54,547 --> 00:57:55,149
Speaker 1: you know the go.

859
00:57:55,169 --> 00:57:58,160
Speaker 0: that's like like if rim walked out onto an ice-skating rink.

860
00:57:59,342 --> 00:58:06,924
Speaker 0: He played some hockey like in one game and he beat, you know the entire, you know Blackhawks all by himself.

861
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:09,995
Speaker 0: Yeah, even certainly even even defending the goal.

862
00:58:10,316 --> 00:58:11,420
Speaker 0: and they're just like, you know, what rim.

863
00:58:12,661 --> 00:58:17,960
Speaker 0: You just played one game of hockey, you know, or maybe five games of hockey one you won four out of five.

864
00:58:18,281 --> 00:58:19,508
Speaker 0: We're just gonna put your name on the cup.

865
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:25,300
Speaker 0: I mean, I didn't play in the NHL season You didn't you know, you didn't go do anything else.

866
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:26,085
Speaker 0: We're just here's the.

867
00:58:26,105 --> 00:58:27,292
Speaker 0: put your name on the cup and you know what?

868
00:58:27,494 --> 00:58:28,520
Speaker 0: Here's an Olympic gold medal.

869
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:29,564
Speaker 0: It's not even the Olympics.

870
00:58:30,066 --> 00:58:30,728
Speaker 0: Here's the gold man.

871
00:58:30,929 --> 00:58:32,615
Speaker 1: I could probably take on the Leafs.

872
00:58:32,755 --> 00:58:33,819
Speaker 1: I can at least win a couple games.

873
00:58:36,622 --> 00:58:38,289
Speaker 0: Right, that's basically just like here.

874
00:58:38,429 --> 00:58:40,960
Speaker 0: this computer is as good as the highest ranked player.

875
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:43,849
Speaker 1: There you go And it is the commentary already.

876
00:58:43,869 --> 00:58:49,490
Speaker 1: it did some things in the game that no human Has ever seriously done as far as we can tell.

877
00:58:49,912 --> 00:58:56,140
Speaker 0: and in the one game at loss the human, you know Displayed his magnificence right and did amazing things as well.

878
00:58:56,225 --> 00:59:01,660
Speaker 1: Yeah So it was very interesting watching the computer flail and try increasingly desperate moves.

879
00:59:01,761 --> 00:59:04,176
Speaker 1: It was doing whatever had the best chance of winning.

880
00:59:04,296 --> 00:59:04,880
Speaker 0: see that's the thing.

881
00:59:04,942 --> 00:59:05,360
Speaker 0: So right.

882
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:12,400
Speaker 0: So that was the most fascinating part for me because it was the part Understood the most right because I don't I can't really tell what to do that in games, right?

883
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:19,040
Speaker 0: I can't tell what's going on and go really all that much Except because I've only played going very small boards and very poorly.

884
00:59:19,381 --> 00:59:25,664
Speaker 0: so the only things that I know are bad are like really basic moves right and Towards the end.

885
00:59:26,025 --> 00:59:32,951
Speaker 0: when it had lost it started doing moves that even I could just see immediately Like that's dumb that piece is just gonna get taken.

886
00:59:32,971 --> 00:59:34,216
Speaker 0: you just gave points to the other guy.

887
00:59:34,256 --> 00:59:36,427
Speaker 0: that was odd and I'm like Why would the computer do that?

888
00:59:36,528 --> 00:59:38,400
Speaker 0: And then I looked at the board even more closely.

889
00:59:38,682 --> 00:59:47,200
Speaker 0: I like paused the video and I realized wait That's a dumb move because the next move the other guy is gonna make is this move which will just take those pieces.

890
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:53,178
Speaker 0: But if that other guy doesn't make that move if the other guy is really dumb, right?

891
00:59:53,398 --> 01:00:00,691
Speaker 0: Which he isn't He's like the best there is right close to it then That move would actually be the first in a series of moves

892
01:00:00,992 --> 01:00:02,095
Speaker 1: that would allow

893
01:00:02,155 --> 01:00:07,240
Speaker 0: it to get a whole bunch of points back And be back in the game if the other guy just lets it right.

894
01:00:07,602 --> 01:00:09,070
Speaker 0: So, of course, he didn't let it.

895
01:00:09,151 --> 01:00:14,027
Speaker 0: but the computer is basically like saying Alright, are you he's like he's like I've.

896
01:00:14,228 --> 01:00:17,720
Speaker 0: the computer is like I have lost but I could still win if you're really dumb.

897
01:00:18,001 --> 01:00:20,052
Speaker 0: So I'm just gonna check and make sure you're not really dumb.

898
01:00:20,253 --> 01:00:20,856
Speaker 0: Oh, you're not.

899
01:00:20,916 --> 01:00:21,700
Speaker 0: Alright, let me try again.

900
01:00:22,183 --> 01:00:24,719
Speaker 0: Oh, you're not and it ran out of those and then it gave up.

901
01:00:25,162 --> 01:00:33,000
Speaker 0: So it was almost like in football where you know I talked about this a lot where it's like you're losing in order to come back because you're so far behind.

902
01:00:33,362 --> 01:00:41,560
Speaker 0: You can't just play conservatively which the AlphaGo does very, you know AlphaGo gets ahead and plays conservatively just to keep its winning.

903
01:00:42,223 --> 01:00:49,720
Speaker 0: It doesn't try to like be aggressive and get a whole bunch of points Which is actually why it's worse at playing black than it playing white because black goes first.

904
01:00:50,102 --> 01:00:51,529
Speaker 0: It has to be more aggressive, right?

905
01:00:51,911 --> 01:00:52,615
Speaker 0: It doesn't do that.

906
01:00:52,695 --> 01:00:53,580
Speaker 0: It says I'm winning.

907
01:00:53,882 --> 01:00:57,928
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna do whatever I have to do to keep this points lead Right and win the game.

908
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:05,201
Speaker 0: It doesn't try to like score a whole bunch of extra points and like run up the score like New England Patriots or whatever Right.

909
01:01:05,422 --> 01:01:09,920
Speaker 0: It just tries to win the game which and the best way to do that is by getting ahead and playing conservatively.

910
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:18,840
Speaker 0: So when it's behind it has to do a high-risk high-reward Maneuvers in order to get back into the lead because that's the best chance of winning.

911
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:26,886
Speaker 0: It's like what's my best chance of winning this football game when I'm down by two touchdowns Miracle onside kick Ridiculous trick play right.

912
01:01:26,926 --> 01:01:34,395
Speaker 0: so in go it just so happens that an onside kick is make a really dumb move and hope the other Guy doesn't you know, it's really what an onside kick is.

913
01:01:34,416 --> 01:01:35,220
Speaker 0: It's a really dumb move.

914
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:39,260
Speaker 0: It's I'm gonna kick it really short and give myself bad field position.

915
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:39,431
Speaker 0: Yeah.

916
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:46,229
Speaker 0: And hope the other team can't catch this football that's bouncing around and you know Right and hope that I get it instead right.

917
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:47,634
Speaker 0: and that's in seeing it do that.

918
01:01:47,674 --> 01:01:48,798
Speaker 0: I understood what was going on.

919
01:01:48,858 --> 01:01:51,329
Speaker 0: I'm like, aha What a smart computer.

920
01:01:51,591 --> 01:01:58,800
Speaker 1: a commentator has also pointed out that it Acted like a human and appeared to show the kind of intuition sort of past the go Turing test, right?

921
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,012
Speaker 0: It's like every I was.

922
01:02:00,052 --> 01:02:09,880
Speaker 0: there's two different Commentaries in English and also a Korean one that I can't understand but in all three of them because I did watch you could see The people who are experts at go who are commenting, right?

923
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:31,099
Speaker 0: They're also at that highest divine rank or commenting and they're like, yeah It'll play this move next and about half the time the computer played that move next Right, so it's like even you know human, I think that is actually less of a statement about how great the computer is, but how great people are and that this ridiculously complicated game.

924
01:02:31,805 --> 01:02:39,820
Speaker 0: You know over the 2,500 years of playing We've figured out a lot of the correct moves to make in various patterns and we're right.

925
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:53,553
Speaker 1: Oh, well that we or at least as right as as can be known we have developed Heuristics simple enough to hold in a human brain that are almost as good as state-of-the-art 2016 AI.

926
01:02:53,714 --> 01:02:54,319
Speaker 0: that's pretty good.

927
01:02:54,485 --> 01:02:59,515
Speaker 0: Yeah Humans right bad and the human can come up with that answer while the computer is thinking right.

928
01:02:59,535 --> 01:03:00,719
Speaker 0: the computer took like about.

929
01:03:00,959 --> 01:03:06,919
Speaker 0: you know Sometimes it did faster than other times But it always took its turn in about like 30 seconds or so or something like that, right?

930
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:13,145
Speaker 0: But a lot of times, you know, the person who's commenting doesn't have to like sweat and you know Take their time with their decision.

931
01:03:13,165 --> 01:03:16,440
Speaker 0: They can just be like it could play here and then it plays there, right?

932
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:17,364
Speaker 0: You know, it's like.

933
01:03:17,404 --> 01:03:30,996
Speaker 0: I almost went, you know, but the guy actually playing is like And I'm sure if the commentator was actually playing they would also be thinking much harder and not just going with their first instinct on Every move right but but often that first instinct was the right instinct, but

934
01:03:31,036 --> 01:03:36,648
Speaker 1: we'll be talking about this You know, there's a lot of consequences of these games Like this is big news and

935
01:03:36,708 --> 01:03:46,846
Speaker 0: even the people who made it who actually, you know, they keep calling it Google's AlphaGo, but actually it's a company Google bought that makes this but anyway But yeah, Google owns it now.

936
01:03:46,966 --> 01:03:50,500
Speaker 0: Sergey Brin was even there like one of the days, you know to make an appearance or whatever.

937
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:57,780
Speaker 1: But what I've read the next applications of this particular strain of AI learning is going to be medical diagnoses and humans.

938
01:03:57,961 --> 01:04:00,821
Speaker 0: You can use this for all sorts of ridiculous things Like.

939
01:04:00,861 --> 01:04:04,393
Speaker 0: you could use this for spam filtering or you know, you could.

940
01:04:04,413 --> 01:04:06,440
Speaker 0: you can use this for like so many different applications.

941
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:21,140
Speaker 0: It's just kind of I try to do some tutorials and like how to make it work how to do Google tensorflow stuff and the tutorials are not very helpful for someone of my math knowledge level But I'm gonna keep working on it because there's tons of stuff you can do with this.

942
01:04:21,682 --> 01:04:33,600
Speaker 0: And I just want to point out one more thing is that this is able to work for Go Even though Go is like the most complex game only because is a game of perfect information, right?

943
01:04:33,822 --> 01:04:40,000
Speaker 0: You couldn't get this to even play poker Which is much simpler than Go because it has no idea what the fuck anyone else has in their hand.

944
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:45,160
Speaker 0: Right and because of you know, if there was some hidden stones and go it wouldn't it wouldn't work.

945
01:04:45,441 --> 01:04:49,240
Speaker 0: It has to know everything that's going on to be able to make these good decisions.

946
01:04:49,521 --> 01:04:52,054
Speaker 1: Now you could make an AI with different kinds of heuristics.

947
01:04:52,194 --> 01:04:53,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, it would have done, right?

948
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,579
Speaker 0: It would have to like be guessing it like what's you know?

949
01:04:55,700 --> 01:05:01,853
Speaker 0: But let's say we had it play poker and we just said well the cards and other people's hands You know the odds of what they could be.

950
01:05:01,913 --> 01:05:02,760
Speaker 0: now make your decision.

951
01:05:03,101 --> 01:05:07,915
Speaker 0: It would still be really good, but it wouldn't be like just so consistently dominant.

952
01:05:07,955 --> 01:05:09,540
Speaker 0: because luck, right?

953
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:15,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, but in the end and there's also no luck in Go even forget about perfect information, right?

954
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:16,955
Speaker 0: There's no luck in Go right you play something like T&E.

955
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:21,080
Speaker 0: Not only is there to not knowing what's in other people's hands, right?

956
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:32,344
Speaker 0: Even though a computer could remember how many points everyone has but not knowing what tiles you're gonna draw That's that would mess it up big time because I imagine I think it would play like in T&E if it was behind by A little bit.

957
01:05:32,404 --> 01:05:34,440
Speaker 0: it would try to dump tiles, right?

958
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:39,540
Speaker 0: So would I and then sure it would try to dump tiles is like an onside kick and get a fistful of blue tiles.

959
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:40,163
Speaker 0: Then what would you do?

960
01:05:40,203 --> 01:05:42,936
Speaker 0: dump six more and end the game and when it's losing, I don't know, right?

961
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:47,855
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is eventually we'll have methods for those sorts of a eyes.

962
01:05:47,915 --> 01:06:00,542
Speaker 1: the the AI, you know The thing that's going to cause the mainstream people to really freak out is gonna be when there is an AI that plays Texas Hold'em Consistently better than humans in the long run all the time No matter what.

963
01:06:00,763 --> 01:06:08,919
Speaker 1: Yep, and it'll be interesting as to if I suspect that's possible Just from looking at cards played and odds and games over time.

964
01:06:09,662 --> 01:06:20,154
Speaker 1: But it'll be real interesting if one of the inputs into that is Cameras looking at the other players Analyzing human emotions and facial regular stuff.

965
01:06:20,194 --> 01:06:20,777
Speaker 0: this can be done.

966
01:06:20,797 --> 01:06:33,420
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm curious how it'll play something like netrunner because like netrunner it's like, okay, we should know she in advance I put down a card with four advancements Running that could either score the computer a bunch of points and win at the game or it could lose immediately.

967
01:06:33,761 --> 01:06:34,384
Speaker 0: What's it gonna do?

968
01:06:34,404 --> 01:06:35,729
Speaker 0: one out of two shot?

969
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:38,520
Speaker 0: Is it gonna roll a 1d2 in its memory and then decide?

970
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:39,720
Speaker 0: What's it gonna do?

971
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:46,111
Speaker 1: It's gonna step back and look at the history of all games Where a situation like that happened and look at how those games went.

972
01:06:46,613 --> 01:06:53,840
Speaker 0: you had to figure out I mean usually I mean most of the time most decks don't play the instant kill card, right?

973
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:57,259
Speaker 0: So it's you know in most games you would just get points doing that.

974
01:06:57,621 --> 01:07:01,739
Speaker 0: So but if it ran and died it would be game over a no runner AI.

975
01:07:02,161 --> 01:07:03,933
Speaker 0: So that's gonna be using this current method.

976
01:07:03,973 --> 01:07:12,057
Speaker 0: right of the of you know The neural net and the whatever right the same method that AlphaGo uses I think would have a very hard time in games with luck and imperfect information.

977
01:07:12,238 --> 01:07:27,760
Speaker 1: the netrunner I think you need a different mechanism could scrape the internet and tournament information to figure out the ongoing meta and Maybe even figure things out about its opponents and then use that information in its heuristic scouting is against the rules of netrun ever cheating.

978
01:07:28,701 --> 01:07:30,045
Speaker 1: But how could you stop it?

979
01:07:30,286 --> 01:07:31,249
Speaker 0: I know you can't stop.

980
01:07:31,310 --> 01:07:33,136
Speaker 0: Yeah, everyone keeps saying there's no way.

981
01:07:33,336 --> 01:07:38,897
Speaker 1: if I'm gonna lie If I was in a never under tournament, I would look at the Facebook of the people I thought we're gonna be in the tournament.

982
01:07:39,483 --> 01:07:41,620
Speaker 0: Well, I mean you could look at the netrunner DB of those people.

983
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:42,544
Speaker 0: But yeah, just if you could.

984
01:07:42,564 --> 01:07:46,160
Speaker 0: just you know, bringing rock to the scissors is just how things go.

985
01:07:46,681 --> 01:07:49,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean, you know, what's the compute?

986
01:07:49,530 --> 01:07:52,560
Speaker 0: could if everyone knows the computers gonna be playing everyone could target things.

987
01:07:52,580 --> 01:08:00,610
Speaker 0: They know the computer's weakness is but it's even if the computer knows that it has this weakness It's it's not like you can do anything about it.

988
01:08:00,631 --> 01:08:06,573
Speaker 0: It's like if I know that I'm bad at you know the swimming part of the triathlon I'm still slow at swimming.

989
01:08:06,654 --> 01:08:08,525
Speaker 0: It's like good But I'm gonna do better.

990
01:08:08,565 --> 01:08:11,940
Speaker 1: or you get you build a different body because you're a robot and you can do whatever you want.

991
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:18,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's you know I'm really want to see something play games with randomness and imperfect information.

992
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:25,080
Speaker 1: But I suspect that after this point humans will not significantly contribute to the further understanding of go as a game.

993
01:08:26,162 --> 01:08:30,283
Speaker 0: I think they I think they will in the very short term because They're humans.

994
01:08:30,303 --> 01:08:36,399
Speaker 0: the humans who are into go are gonna learn a ton from these games and other games that happened in chess.

995
01:08:37,084 --> 01:08:38,959
Speaker 1: Humans never beat the AI again.

996
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:44,560
Speaker 1: The only thing that happened was human games started doing things they did ending in draws more.

997
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:49,316
Speaker 0: Oh, yes, they're not letting the AlphaGo play so many public games against masters.

998
01:08:49,376 --> 01:08:50,259
Speaker 0: It played five games.

999
01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:52,567
Speaker 0: now They're gonna improve it I guess before letting it play anyone else.

1000
01:08:53,109 --> 01:08:59,899
Speaker 0: and in these like very extreme short term They're gonna learn from what it did and learn new things from that on their own.

1001
01:09:00,201 --> 01:09:13,520
Speaker 0: But then when AlphaGo comes back another time or another time Right after it's like alpha beta or I guess beta go or gamma go or whatever it is at that point It'll be so advanced that there isn't anything new to learn from it.

1002
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:17,832
Speaker 0: It'll just school everyone and there won't be any human, you know, I don't.

1003
01:09:18,073 --> 01:09:20,120
Speaker 0: it'll school everyone more than there is to learn.

1004
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:31,279
Speaker 1: It's gonna play out exactly the same way I did with chess and the end game of that is chess among humans is really boring now And if you played chess against anyone online, they're almost always cheating with AI.

1005
01:09:31,982 --> 01:09:32,845
Speaker 0: It'll be kind of sad.

1006
01:09:32,926 --> 01:09:42,080
Speaker 0: if if I mean I don't like go I don't like playing it You know, but it'll be kind of sad if it goes the way of chess to where playing it professionally is now dumb.

1007
01:09:42,553 --> 01:09:53,310
Speaker 1: Yeah well it wouldn't be dumb except that chess is kind of fundamental end game seems to be that like the gravity like the Attractors in the full space of chess that we haven't explored.

1008
01:09:53,832 --> 01:10:01,260
Speaker 1: it appears that most of the attractors are draws So humans can stumble into the draw patterns and do things that the AI is also doing.

1009
01:10:01,741 --> 01:10:11,797
Speaker 1: but because the humans aren't perfect like the AI is or at least not near perfect the humans will always be pulled into the Draw black holes and playing for the draw is much more reliable now than playing for the win.

1010
01:10:11,817 --> 01:10:16,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Wonder if the game of go itself will change in any way, right?

1011
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:20,540
Speaker 0: Will they upgrade to like 20 by 20 or 21 by 21?

1012
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:21,384
Speaker 0: Well, that's gonna be the other.

1013
01:10:21,404 --> 01:10:25,080
Speaker 0: are they gonna upgrade it to beyond the capacity of the computer?

1014
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:35,102
Speaker 0: But you know humans will have to change their game dramatically obviously also But at least if they can get out of range of the computer being able to play then they can still have meaningful games Again, there

1015
01:10:35,183 --> 01:10:36,627
Speaker 1: might however now and not

1016
01:10:36,747 --> 01:10:41,141
Speaker 0: everything from 19 by 19 is irrelevant in 20 by 20 or 21 by 21.

1017
01:10:41,141 --> 01:10:46,097
Speaker 1: But I think the AI is now in a similar intuitive position to humans.

1018
01:10:46,699 --> 01:10:55,015
Speaker 1: I suspect this AI if thrown against 20 by 20 Would do as well as at least like the Masters.

1019
01:10:55,095 --> 01:10:56,300
Speaker 1: It might not be humans all the time.

1020
01:10:56,543 --> 01:10:57,415
Speaker 0: The problem is it do.

1021
01:10:57,516 --> 01:11:06,100
Speaker 0: well I think the problem is is if you go to like if you go even bigger just if you let's say, you know Let's say we knew for sure the 25 by 25 was out of the computers range.

1022
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:11,357
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, like you would run out of time because Moore's law hasn't caught up right and whatever you we just can't.

1023
01:11:11,617 --> 01:11:13,626
Speaker 1: but how good Would humans be at that game?

1024
01:11:13,746 --> 01:11:16,760
Speaker 0: Well, I mean so I mean a lot of the things they know already would be okay.

1025
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,529
Speaker 0: I think the problem is the game is to be too long.

1026
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:22,161
Speaker 0: It would just take too long to play a 25 by 25.

1027
01:11:22,161 --> 01:11:23,405
Speaker 0: You'd be there for like 10 years.

1028
01:11:23,425 --> 01:11:28,380
Speaker 1: go Google Google for the 50 move rule or the hundred move rule in chess.

1029
01:11:28,521 --> 01:11:30,669
Speaker 1: That is the sad state of chess today.

1030
01:11:30,689 --> 01:11:33,560
Speaker 0: Well, I mean go doesn't have that problem because the board only fills up more.

1031
01:11:33,781 --> 01:11:35,651
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if the board gets too big, it's like.

1032
01:11:35,671 --> 01:11:37,179
Speaker 0: well we had to fill this whole fucking board.

1033
01:11:37,703 --> 01:11:44,718
Speaker 1: All right, we don't have time for this shit and I suspect Unlike the NHL or the NFL No one's gonna change the rules of go.

1034
01:11:46,161 --> 01:11:49,999
Speaker 0: Mmm, I could see some minor rules being changed.

1035
01:11:50,863 --> 01:11:54,360
Speaker 0: Duty things learned from this computer, but it would take a very long time, right?

1036
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:57,735
Speaker 1: But I didn't know there was a disconnect between the two methods of scoring.

1037
01:11:57,775 --> 01:11:58,820
Speaker 1: that was actually different.

1038
01:11:58,901 --> 01:12:02,057
Speaker 0: There's different methods of scoring There's there's all sorts of thing.

1039
01:12:02,117 --> 01:12:17,720
Speaker 0: go you know despite being what seems like a culture of like a conservative old game of like 2500 years old has changed its rules over the course of time pretty significantly Slowly because in the last ten years go go is not afraid.

1040
01:12:17,861 --> 01:12:19,005
Speaker 0: I mean, it's it's not.

1041
01:12:19,086 --> 01:12:28,900
Speaker 0: it's less afraid to change its rules than baseball is right It's not I mean, it's still conservative, but it's less afraid of changing than other conservative games and sports out there.

1042
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,859
Speaker 1: So chess's rules have changed significantly over the years, right?

1043
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:35,152
Speaker 1: I'm Hassan and all that shit and moving pawns twice in the beginning.

1044
01:12:35,453 --> 01:12:37,605
Speaker 1: that just happened to speed up the game because the game went too long.

1045
01:12:37,847 --> 01:12:40,709
Speaker 0: Yep, so Good for you in that respect.

1046
01:12:40,749 --> 01:12:42,759
Speaker 0: go but computers coming for you.

1081
01:15:18,543 --> 01:15:24,018
Speaker 1: Yep Lieutenant are we supposed to question suspects this way?

1082
01:15:26,686 --> 01:15:27,850
Speaker 1: Is this by the book lieutenant?
