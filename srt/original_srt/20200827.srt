1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,191
Speaker 1: It's Thursday August 27th 2020.

2
00:00:12,191 --> 00:00:15,159
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

3
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:22,678
Speaker 1: tonight We are talking about our own personal histories of buying stuff online Which wasn't always the thing?

4
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,558
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:27,062 --> 00:00:31,600
Speaker 0: So we already did a podcast about like exercise video games or whatever.

6
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:36,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, and of course we should have waited to do that episode, but we didn't have another show idea.

7
00:00:38,802 --> 00:00:44,120
Speaker 0: Recently got this thing called Zwift, which is it's good and bad, right?

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:01:26,704
Speaker 0: So it's basically the idea is you get some sort of stationary bicycle or bike trainer that has the necessary Bluetooth connections right to report to so that it can report it yours your power and cadence and whatnot to some other device externally like a bike computer and You connect it to your phone tablet or computer and you run the Zwift software and Zwift is a virtual world where people are biking around and it comes to training programs and all this stuff And if your trainer or stationary bike is fancy enough the game will actually end up Controlling the bike to make it harder or easier to pedal Based on.

9
00:01:26,924 --> 00:01:32,319
Speaker 0: you know, like the world that you're in it's like you're biking up a hill and it suddenly gets harder to pedal, right?

10
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:39,980
Speaker 0: So Since the gym in my building, you know, I was like, well, I can't go outside too much.

11
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,672
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go use the trainer the the stationary bike in the gym.

12
00:01:43,712 --> 00:01:44,856
Speaker 1: No gems are closed.

13
00:01:45,277 --> 00:01:46,040
Speaker 0: I did it for a while.

14
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,287
Speaker 0: I was about to do it.

15
00:01:47,328 --> 00:01:47,931
Speaker 0: They closed it.

16
00:01:48,334 --> 00:01:49,299
Speaker 0: then they opened it again.

17
00:01:49,621 --> 00:01:52,439
Speaker 0: So I did it and then they closed it again and it's still closed.

18
00:01:52,781 --> 00:01:57,220
Speaker 1: Our gym is weirdly still open but no one will use it like no one's willing to use it, but it is open.

19
00:01:58,261 --> 00:02:04,560
Speaker 0: So anyway, so I already had this wahoo kicker bike computer that I use for GPS when I'm outside.

20
00:02:05,102 --> 00:02:06,268
Speaker 0: So I got the wahoo.

21
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:17,244
Speaker 0: I was gonna get the wahoo kicker trainer Which is direct drive trainer Which is where you take off your rear wheel and you directly connect your bike to the gears on the trainer And it.

22
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:20,379
Speaker 0: those are vastly superior to the ones you keep your wheel on.

23
00:02:21,022 --> 00:02:22,227
Speaker 0: They're just way more expensive.

24
00:02:22,327 --> 00:02:23,170
Speaker 0: Obviously it was.

25
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:26,443
Speaker 0: it was a lot of money and I was thinking about getting it But I didn't get it.

26
00:02:26,523 --> 00:02:27,006
Speaker 0: I didn't get it.

27
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:30,058
Speaker 0: I didn't get it and then they came out with a slightly upgraded version.

28
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:31,543
Speaker 0: Okay, fine.

29
00:02:31,864 --> 00:02:34,513
Speaker 1: That's the way Scott like ooh GoPro is pretty good.

30
00:02:34,553 --> 00:02:35,656
Speaker 1: But do I really need a GoPro?

31
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:36,740
Speaker 1: Oh, there's a new GoPro.

32
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:40,080
Speaker 1: Well, I guess if I guess now's the time now's the time, right?

33
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,812
Speaker 0: So if I'm not gonna buy if I don't buy it now, then I'm never gonna buy it.

34
00:02:42,832 --> 00:02:45,804
Speaker 0: So I Figure winter is coming, right?

35
00:02:46,024 --> 00:02:51,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, and also, you know all indoor sports equipment is just gonna sell the fuck out in like October.

36
00:02:52,402 --> 00:02:54,771
Speaker 0: That's the other thing is the previous version was sold out.

37
00:02:54,832 --> 00:02:56,880
Speaker 0: this new one came out and they had him in stock.

38
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,864
Speaker 0: I'm like, well, okay.

39
00:02:57,884 --> 00:03:02,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, and also the Swift app thing cost 15 bucks a month.

40
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,150
Speaker 0: So we'll see if we keep pay.

41
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,260
Speaker 0: I haven't even paid for it yet.

42
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,571
Speaker 0: I just had a free trial that came with the trainer.

43
00:03:06,732 --> 00:03:07,515
Speaker 0: you keep doing it though.

44
00:03:07,556 --> 00:03:14,559
Speaker 0: It must be pretty good Yeah, so I'm doing it and I'm streaming it on my twitch channel So you can watch me bike to nowhere if you really have nothing to do.

45
00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:25,037
Speaker 0: but I found that a Streaming this has worked out for me better than streaming other video games because when I'm streaming other video games I don't say much and I'm trying to focus on the game.

46
00:03:25,057 --> 00:03:29,655
Speaker 0: Yep And if I got it, you know, that's why I stopped streaming xcom cuz.

47
00:03:29,696 --> 00:03:30,519
Speaker 1: well, that's really fun.

48
00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:33,708
Speaker 1: It's a lot of energy.

49
00:03:33,728 --> 00:03:34,391
Speaker 1: It's not.

50
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:39,052
Speaker 1: it's not the same just like when I'm playing a game by myself Just like sitting there like a shiloh play my game versus like.

51
00:03:39,373 --> 00:03:40,800
Speaker 1: alright like and subscribe.

52
00:03:40,981 --> 00:03:44,920
Speaker 1: I'm gonna attack this guy because of this reason like I can't keep that energy up for four hours.

53
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:46,724
Speaker 0: Real streaming is hot.

54
00:03:46,784 --> 00:03:48,310
Speaker 0: real video game streaming is hard work.

55
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:54,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is not hard because when I'm on a bike Talking is sort of natural like a bike with someone and I talk to them.

56
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,065
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I got.

57
00:03:56,086 --> 00:03:58,054
Speaker 0: I finally got a pretty good setup where you can.

58
00:03:58,094 --> 00:03:59,580
Speaker 0: just you know, it's like bike and chat.

59
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,342
Speaker 0: It's really good.

60
00:04:00,643 --> 00:04:01,164
Speaker 0: Plus I can.

61
00:04:01,264 --> 00:04:09,553
Speaker 0: the Swift, you know app makes riding the stationary bike like way way way better and I like Okay, we know I knew in advance.

62
00:04:09,614 --> 00:04:13,971
Speaker 0: Yeah, it makes the Communicate to the trainer makes it harder and faster to pedal.

63
00:04:14,473 --> 00:04:24,162
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a poorly rendered low Graphical quality CG world that is definitely way less than $15 a month should get you That.

64
00:04:24,202 --> 00:04:28,036
Speaker 0: you see yourself biking in and you know, this race is in there, which I'm not doing.

65
00:04:28,057 --> 00:04:29,767
Speaker 0: all this other stuff I like.

66
00:04:29,808 --> 00:04:35,973
Speaker 0: I knew all that in advance But after doing it it vastly exceeded expectations.

67
00:04:36,194 --> 00:04:38,440
Speaker 0: like you you're right you're biking up a hill.

68
00:04:38,982 --> 00:04:46,412
Speaker 0: It feels like you're biking up a hill as much as it's got because I've been on non trainer Exercise bikes were ooh hill mode.

69
00:04:46,673 --> 00:04:48,140
Speaker 1: the pedal just gets harder to pedal.

70
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,011
Speaker 1: It does not feel like I'm actually biking up a hill.

71
00:04:50,293 --> 00:04:51,460
Speaker 1: It feels like my brakes are stuck.

72
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:57,687
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know it's so smooth and so quiet and you know It doesn't disturb people around.

73
00:04:57,788 --> 00:05:00,320
Speaker 0: versus like the wheel on trainers make a lot of noise.

74
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,036
Speaker 0: So there's the other people living with you.

75
00:05:03,043 --> 00:05:09,832
Speaker 0: You obviously need a fan blowing on you while you're riding this And you know, you need a towel to cover your handlebars.

76
00:05:09,872 --> 00:05:10,636
Speaker 0: they don't get all sweaty.

77
00:05:10,676 --> 00:05:14,860
Speaker 1: we need a dynamic Blower so it speeds up the blowing if you're going fast.

78
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,282
Speaker 1: They do.

79
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:21,569
Speaker 0: they do sell one of those million dollars and they sell a bunch of extra Accessories you don't need which I didn't buy it.

80
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:22,653
Speaker 1: I need a UV lamp.

81
00:05:22,753 --> 00:05:24,340
Speaker 1: So I get the sunburn I would have gotten.

82
00:05:27,321 --> 00:05:31,880
Speaker 0: But yeah a greatly exceeded expectations and I keep using it and I'll probably keep using it through the winner.

83
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:37,882
Speaker 1: We'll see if I keep when if I ever stop paying for it sounds like it does enough like despite though You know kind of like.

84
00:05:37,902 --> 00:05:47,555
Speaker 1: VR is a similar thing in that despite the low quality of like the visuals It's showing you I feel like it's enough for your brain to sort of map everything together.

85
00:05:47,636 --> 00:05:51,659
Speaker 1: Like yeah, it's kind of like biking like Okay, I'm biking now like it puts your brain in a different mode.

86
00:05:52,981 --> 00:06:04,276
Speaker 0: And the way the training programs work is this thing called ERG mode where instead of you know Difficulty matching the terrain what they do is they actually set.

87
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:12,296
Speaker 0: when I was you know Just biking on the stationary bike in the gym I was like my plan was Stay at 90 rpm regardless of difficulty.

88
00:06:12,376 --> 00:06:16,679
Speaker 0: make it easier If you have to just stay at 90 rpm for as long as you know for the time period.

89
00:06:16,739 --> 00:06:19,359
Speaker 1: I mean That's kind of how I bike like my goal is how I bike outside.

90
00:06:19,544 --> 00:06:31,936
Speaker 0: Yeah I was trying to simulate biking outside which is stay at 90 rpm unless you're going up some crazy hill and you can't and you're Lowest gear right but otherwise always shift to whatever gear that you can bike at 90 rpm in.

91
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,250
Speaker 0: so The trainer though the ERG mode.

92
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,739
Speaker 0: what they do is it's not about the RPM.

93
00:06:38,602 --> 00:06:41,333
Speaker 0: It sets the trainer at a particular wattage.

94
00:06:41,754 --> 00:06:59,122
Speaker 0: it forces you even Even if you shift gears like let's say you shift into a lower gear right you'll see your cadence will go up sure But it's gonna get harder to pedal Relatively because it's forcing you to put out a particular wattage Constantly.

95
00:06:59,463 --> 00:07:08,539
Speaker 0: if you could shift into a higher gear and suddenly pedaling will feel a little bit easier kinda your cadence will be lower Because you're putting out the same wattage though.

96
00:07:10,604 --> 00:07:12,200
Speaker 0: So that's the way the training works.

97
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,670
Speaker 0: But the trick with that is that as well if you can keep it up You're good to go right.

98
00:07:17,711 --> 00:07:29,620
Speaker 0: as long as you keep pedaling It's a plus, but if for some reason like you get you get some weakness And you can't keep up with the wattage you end up in a spiral of doom because your cadence goes down.

99
00:07:29,881 --> 00:07:34,960
Speaker 0: So it makes it tougher and your cadence goes down, and it makes it tougher, and then you're sort of you get stuck.

100
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:41,212
Speaker 1: That's a lot like when you're biking up a long hill climb and you're run out of steam But you're already in your lowest gear right.

101
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:48,740
Speaker 0: so doing this training thing That's gonna determine my like something threshold power or whatever and measure nonsense and whatnot.

102
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,257
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's lots of factors there like your VO2 max matters.

103
00:07:52,621 --> 00:07:57,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's all kinds of ramp, but it was like okay do a hundred watts for two minutes.

104
00:07:57,401 --> 00:07:59,893
Speaker 0: Okay, now do two hundred and five watts for one minute.

105
00:07:59,934 --> 00:08:09,850
Speaker 1: I'm like it's like oh god That sounds a lot like when I got a VO2 max like test at the doctor when I was in high school And it was just like yeah bike harder bike harder bike harder bike harder.

106
00:08:10,131 --> 00:08:11,074
Speaker 1: You couldn't bike any harder.

107
00:08:11,094 --> 00:08:18,879
Speaker 0: Yep, but yeah the The the heart rate monitor that goes with it, I don't have that and I don't care too much, but that's sold out.

108
00:08:20,081 --> 00:08:25,540
Speaker 0: But you could use any Bluetooth heart rate monitor you could but it there's one that goes with it specifically.

109
00:08:26,103 --> 00:08:29,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know I might as look at all the stuff for the same company for maximum compatibility.

110
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean that's what I do with cameras and everything else like yeah.

111
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:41,799
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the point is if you want to come watch me bike in place But really just talk to me about anything not just biking in place you can come to my twitch channel.

112
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:43,491
Speaker 0: I'm doing it somewhat frequently.

113
00:08:43,611 --> 00:08:46,406
Speaker 0: actually I have a good setup So that makes it easy to do.

114
00:08:47,108 --> 00:08:50,360
Speaker 0: and if you want to bike in place you probably want to set up.

115
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,679
Speaker 0: That is cheaper than this setup.

116
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:59,280
Speaker 1: Yep, like I didn't say getting a trainer because my I want to do more like spin class style like just cardio training in the winter.

117
00:08:59,661 --> 00:09:05,260
Speaker 0: You know I'm only interested in biking outside, so this is basically replacing biking outside or helping me bike outside.

118
00:09:05,607 --> 00:09:06,260
Speaker 1: I have a different mode.

119
00:09:06,601 --> 00:09:10,779
Speaker 1: I've been running a half marathon every week since the quarantine started and I have not missed one.

120
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:16,480
Speaker 1: But I can't do that in the winter And I'm not gonna do it on a treadmill one because I don't want to go to the gym downstairs.

121
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:23,359
Speaker 1: I don't want to have a giant treadmill in my apartment and Running on a treadmill for two hours is the literal definition of hell.

122
00:09:24,381 --> 00:09:25,264
Speaker 1: Like that is just.

123
00:09:25,304 --> 00:09:37,780
Speaker 1: that is not fun for anyone, so I basically wanted a spin kind of Biking just exercise bike to be able to do like two hours of cardio once a week to keep that up all winter.

124
00:09:38,323 --> 00:09:40,454
Speaker 1: So basically my plan will be like every Saturday morning.

125
00:09:40,494 --> 00:09:40,816
Speaker 1: I'll get up.

126
00:09:40,856 --> 00:09:41,560
Speaker 1: I'll get on this thing.

127
00:09:41,962 --> 00:09:46,218
Speaker 1: I'll bike hard for two hours while I like watch a movie Play a switch game.

128
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:47,664
Speaker 0: Yeah.

129
00:09:49,043 --> 00:09:55,640
Speaker 0: So yeah, yeah the the setup I have is I mean if you count the cost of my bicycle because it's using my real bicycle, right?

130
00:09:57,162 --> 00:10:00,236
Speaker 0: The price will be very high yeah, and you know the above.

131
00:10:00,356 --> 00:10:04,656
Speaker 1: using your real bicycle That's a lot like buying a new computer around a fancy video card.

132
00:10:04,676 --> 00:10:09,251
Speaker 0: you already own Mmm But I made this bicycle.

133
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:14,198
Speaker 0: when I have to go back outside I take it off the train or put the wheel back on yeah, so so I'd get dual use out of it.

134
00:10:14,941 --> 00:10:24,960
Speaker 1: Yep, so in the news there was one like really big news, and you have to pay attention to this because Regardless of if it continues or not it was a historic moment, and it's like it's not gonna.

135
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:32,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seems like it might not continue, but basically if you somehow like even people I know like didn't notice this news right away.

136
00:10:33,084 --> 00:10:35,059
Speaker 1: But basically the NBA went on strike.

137
00:10:36,121 --> 00:10:41,480
Speaker 0: They didn't use the word strike because they would just contractual obligations and legal nonsense.

138
00:10:41,621 --> 00:10:50,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the NBA is not a boycott, but it was a strike Yeah, so basically and I'll link to this article that talks about why it was a strike not a boycott.

139
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:54,520
Speaker 0: But the point is easily the boycott means you're not buying something a strike.

140
00:10:54,584 --> 00:10:57,003
Speaker 0: Yeah We're not going to work But go to work.

141
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:05,967
Speaker 1: this gets complicated for a lot of reasons because there are a lot of groups in America who are either contractually or in some cases Legally not allowed to strike.

142
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,654
Speaker 1: That's why I like teachers unions.

143
00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:09,842
Speaker 1: They can't strike in a lot of states It's illegal.

144
00:11:09,923 --> 00:11:10,666
Speaker 0: they can.

145
00:11:10,686 --> 00:11:14,380
Speaker 0: as long as they can't just have you make sure you strike, right?

146
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,812
Speaker 0: So when a strike is illegal right when it's a wildcat strike meaning right?

147
00:11:18,853 --> 00:11:20,839
Speaker 1: There's no official union moment.

148
00:11:22,221 --> 00:11:24,550
Speaker 0: Well wildcat strike is different from any legal strikes.

149
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:29,959
Speaker 0: You can have a wildcat strike even if it's legal to strike It just it means the Union didn't officially say it was a strike.

150
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,127
Speaker 0: Right, the Union didn't declare a strike.

151
00:11:32,147 --> 00:11:34,295
Speaker 0: the people the workers just stopped working.

152
00:11:34,355 --> 00:11:35,720
Speaker 1: right you can also have a work slowdown.

153
00:11:36,021 --> 00:11:36,705
Speaker 1: You can have a work.

154
00:11:36,745 --> 00:11:38,292
Speaker 1: sure you can have a sick point.

155
00:11:38,433 --> 00:11:46,220
Speaker 0: is the original point Is that if you if it is technically illegal for you to strike example teachers union or something like that, right?

156
00:11:46,722 --> 00:11:49,345
Speaker 0: It's not actually Illegal for you to strike.

157
00:11:49,446 --> 00:11:50,088
Speaker 0: It's only.

158
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:55,400
Speaker 0: all that means is if your strike fails There will be severe conflict.

159
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,127
Speaker 1: You'll all be fired and maybe saved.

160
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,901
Speaker 0: if you have even if it's illegal for you to strike I'm gonna.

161
00:12:01,062 --> 00:12:04,955
Speaker 0: I'm an ex-union and we're not allowed to strike because it's teachers or something.

162
00:12:05,396 --> 00:12:16,480
Speaker 0: if you just strike successfully if your strike works Then you won't face any of the consequences from the law for the strike being illegal because you won.

163
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:20,555
Speaker 1: Yeah because no one with a gun is gonna come to your house and force you to do your job.

164
00:12:20,595 --> 00:12:25,380
Speaker 1: the only exception to that the People who actually can't strike are the military.

165
00:12:26,761 --> 00:12:30,515
Speaker 0: Sure, if you try you'll be you'll be AWOL and you'll be arrested.

166
00:12:30,656 --> 00:12:31,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, that won't go.

167
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,993
Speaker 0: Well, unless the unless the MPs are also on strike at that point.

168
00:12:36,034 --> 00:12:36,956
Speaker 1: That is not a strike.

169
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:38,080
Speaker 1: That is a coup.

170
00:12:38,782 --> 00:12:40,098
Speaker 0: Yes, I believe so.

171
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:46,490
Speaker 1: But this was historic is basically and you can read the news Like we're not gonna try to explain to you everything that happened.

172
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,720
Speaker 1: You can read like real journalism that covered this.

173
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:51,028
Speaker 1: Also, this situation is evolving rapidly.

174
00:12:51,048 --> 00:12:52,815
Speaker 1: it's like 6 30 p.m.

175
00:12:52,895 --> 00:12:54,280
Speaker 1: Eastern Time on Thursday.

176
00:12:54,781 --> 00:12:57,951
Speaker 1: So like stuff could move real quick like last night.

177
00:12:57,991 --> 00:13:10,480
Speaker 1: stuff move real quick, but basically the Bucks Decided they weren't gonna play game five Because in solidarity with racial justice concerns because another black man was murdered well shot by the police.

178
00:13:10,802 --> 00:13:11,407
Speaker 1: He didn't die.

179
00:13:11,427 --> 00:13:13,079
Speaker 1: He was shot seven times.

180
00:13:13,686 --> 00:13:16,984
Speaker 0: But yeah, but That was seven too many times.

181
00:13:17,065 --> 00:13:22,359
Speaker 1: Well, yeah that obviously police violence against black people is a huge problem in the United States.

182
00:13:23,383 --> 00:13:27,316
Speaker 1: But they decided they just they would not take they would not come out of the locker room.

183
00:13:27,336 --> 00:13:28,340
Speaker 1: They're not gonna play game five.

184
00:13:29,361 --> 00:13:34,376
Speaker 1: So few other basketball teams also said possibly spontaneously, you know what?

185
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're not gonna play either.

186
00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:36,904
Speaker 0: Oh, that's a good idea.

187
00:13:37,065 --> 00:13:38,629
Speaker 1: Some MLB teams did this.

188
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,277
Speaker 1: the Detroit Lions said, you know what no practice.

189
00:13:41,317 --> 00:13:41,558
Speaker 1: Fuck it.

190
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:43,251
Speaker 1: No practice we're not gonna take the field today.

191
00:13:43,271 --> 00:13:48,600
Speaker 1: and A bunch of bad soccer teams did this bunch of minor league women's hockey.

192
00:13:49,142 --> 00:13:56,195
Speaker 1: This spread real quick and a huge chunk of professional sports in America Basically struck last night.

193
00:13:56,921 --> 00:13:57,985
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm all in.

194
00:13:58,025 --> 00:14:00,295
Speaker 0: supporters like some of them are unstriking.

195
00:14:00,355 --> 00:14:03,971
Speaker 0: They didn't last very long Yeah, so that remains to be seen.

196
00:14:04,091 --> 00:14:04,252
Speaker 0: there

197
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:06,000
Speaker 1: is an article like dateline

198
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,363
Speaker 0: Today

199
00:14:07,383 --> 00:14:23,440
Speaker 1: a few hours ago on waypo that I'll link to the NBA short playoff halt was the sports World's boldest push for racial justice in decades, but it also links to an article Supposedly saying that the players have agreed to resume the playoffs at least in the NBA.

200
00:14:25,964 --> 00:14:26,808
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean word were to.

201
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:29,620
Speaker 1: I dudes like we don't get to say what the players should do.

202
00:14:30,444 --> 00:14:37,330
Speaker 1: All I will say is that this is a powerful moment and those players Have a lot more power than some of them might realize right now.

203
00:14:37,792 --> 00:14:39,656
Speaker 1: America's got a lot of bread and circuses.

204
00:14:39,676 --> 00:14:47,720
Speaker 1: I Think the circuses are very important to the continued tolerance of our societal breakdown.

205
00:14:48,202 --> 00:14:53,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, my hope is that like, okay, we couldn't you know, it's like everyone hopes at least the good people, right?

206
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,244
Speaker 0: We hope like.

207
00:14:54,264 --> 00:14:56,354
Speaker 0: oh, well, we don't actually hope for a strike.

208
00:14:56,374 --> 00:15:01,620
Speaker 1: We hope to just solve the problem The rise of fascism to be blunted and for a right government.

209
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:07,940
Speaker 0: Yes, yes, we just see massive strikes as an effective tool that we have because they're not being used.

210
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:09,804
Speaker 0: Yes strikes.

211
00:15:10,025 --> 00:15:13,800
Speaker 1: Oh such a powerful tool, but only if they succeed, right?

212
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:19,416
Speaker 0: So, you know, it's you kind of imagine like your dream like oh everyone just doesn't go to work today.

213
00:15:19,556 --> 00:15:23,417
Speaker 0: everyone like nobody It's like that'll fix everything and it probably would.

214
00:15:23,437 --> 00:15:25,746
Speaker 1: yeah There's a precedent for that.

215
00:15:25,786 --> 00:15:31,482
Speaker 0: in other countries not the stock market would go you and every rich person would go fuck This.

216
00:15:31,804 --> 00:15:32,246
Speaker 1: or like.

217
00:15:32,286 --> 00:15:33,673
Speaker 1: there's other types of strikes like.

218
00:15:34,155 --> 00:15:35,260
Speaker 1: here's a crazy scenario.

219
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,263
Speaker 1: This is not likely.

220
00:15:36,504 --> 00:15:43,725
Speaker 1: but imagine if the wealthiest states within the United States like at the state level like say things got bad enough To our New York and California.

221
00:15:43,765 --> 00:15:44,247
Speaker 1: We're just like.

222
00:15:44,628 --> 00:15:46,114
Speaker 1: we're not gonna submit federal taxes.

223
00:15:46,134 --> 00:15:47,860
Speaker 1: We're just not gonna send money to the feds.

224
00:15:48,484 --> 00:15:49,329
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see what happens.

225
00:15:49,369 --> 00:15:50,677
Speaker 0: But the point is like that's it.

226
00:15:50,697 --> 00:15:51,160
Speaker 1: That's a strike.

227
00:15:51,521 --> 00:15:57,140
Speaker 0: Everyone imagines, you know, we imagine this giant strikes likes but you can't have something like that come out of nowhere, right?

228
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,625
Speaker 0: You can't just that's not real.

229
00:15:58,645 --> 00:15:59,649
Speaker 1: boots on the ground.

230
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,575
Speaker 1: That's organizing like with a capital.

231
00:16:01,736 --> 00:16:02,699
Speaker 1: Oh, there's a hard work.

232
00:16:03,321 --> 00:16:10,602
Speaker 1: It's like a fantasy right that you would have right especially because America has mostly destroyed the infrastructure of unions being able to coordinate Such an action.

233
00:16:10,944 --> 00:16:27,028
Speaker 0: even a strike like this of like one day right can sort of be like, okay We do one day now and then next time we do like a week And then the next time more people join in and then exit right and it could be you know Finally getting the ball little snowball here.

234
00:16:27,088 --> 00:16:29,676
Speaker 1: look at the ball rolling by preventing the ball from rolling.

235
00:16:30,378 --> 00:16:32,195
Speaker 0: That's right You know.

236
00:16:33,086 --> 00:16:34,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, like this this was a powerful moment.

237
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,776
Speaker 1: Like some some people walked out of other positions in sports.

238
00:16:39,137 --> 00:16:47,701
Speaker 1: the cool thing like one of the things I really appreciated was that a lot of the coaches and a lot of the staff are white because there's obviously a lot of other disparity problems in These leagues.

239
00:16:48,223 --> 00:16:58,719
Speaker 1: but as far as I could see all the coaches of the teams that refused to play not only like Affirmatively supported their players, but also step back and let the players explain what was going on.

240
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, well the NBA is is is sort of unique.

241
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:04,740
Speaker 0: in this way right into where it's really a player run league.

242
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, hey the players union in the NBA is pretty powerful.

243
00:17:08,203 --> 00:17:15,236
Speaker 0: Well, it's not just the union isn't as strong as say the baseball union No, the baseball is the most power but because of the structure of the.

244
00:17:15,377 --> 00:17:23,200
Speaker 0: not just you know The history of the league and the history of basketball right and you know the involvement of black people in basketball, right?

245
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,171
Speaker 0: But also the structure of the game itself.

246
00:17:26,191 --> 00:17:28,319
Speaker 0: Here's some geek nights territory, right?

247
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:40,960
Speaker 0: Basketball is five on five right and it's a game such that just a few good players It's like you have Michael Jordan, right you get Scottie Pippen.

248
00:17:42,082 --> 00:17:44,168
Speaker 0: You need all you need is a Dennis Rodman.

249
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:47,860
Speaker 0: the other two people right like they're good, but yeah, they're good.

250
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,540
Speaker 1: I mean, they're good enough to play professionally.

251
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,700
Speaker 1: You got to be good enough to be on the court with the stars, right?

252
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:55,660
Speaker 1: But it's like the end of the story.

253
00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:02,042
Speaker 0: You can just get like three two to three star players on the court and the rest of the people as long as their NBA Level.

254
00:18:02,685 --> 00:18:04,914
Speaker 0: it's like you're gonna be good enough to win right?

255
00:18:04,954 --> 00:18:08,912
Speaker 0: so a few Players like you know our huge stars.

256
00:18:08,932 --> 00:18:10,740
Speaker 0: They're not wearing helmets, right?

257
00:18:11,141 --> 00:18:12,145
Speaker 0: You see their faces.

258
00:18:12,206 --> 00:18:13,351
Speaker 0: they have personalities.

259
00:18:13,411 --> 00:18:15,160
Speaker 0: they express themselves, right?

260
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:21,200
Speaker 0: They're not like hockey player robots like you know not saying much right props to a vendor Kane for saying a lot recently.

261
00:18:21,562 --> 00:18:23,734
Speaker 0: But yeah, they have huge endorsement deals.

262
00:18:23,795 --> 00:18:24,740
Speaker 0: They're public figures.

263
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,480
Speaker 0: They get involved in other things besides their sport a lot of the time, right?

264
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,880
Speaker 0: So because of the the nature of the game and just that a few star players are what makes the team.

265
00:18:35,422 --> 00:18:37,631
Speaker 0: You know the player chooses the coaches.

266
00:18:38,073 --> 00:18:38,394
Speaker 0: right.

267
00:18:38,836 --> 00:18:42,972
Speaker 0: if you're the star player You're more important to the organization than the GM.

268
00:18:43,012 --> 00:18:43,855
Speaker 0: or you know anyone right?

269
00:18:44,237 --> 00:18:49,376
Speaker 0: whereas in baseball It's like no the owner is the GM the coaches the manager is.

270
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:50,200
Speaker 0: they run the show.

271
00:18:50,441 --> 00:18:51,284
Speaker 0: You're just some player.

272
00:18:51,385 --> 00:18:54,317
Speaker 0: even if you're the star player right you don't run the show here.

273
00:18:54,357 --> 00:18:54,899
Speaker 0: You can't pick.

274
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:02,483
Speaker 1: Yeah You know you can't tell us what to do because individual players have relatively little input into the result of the game compared to basketball Right.

275
00:19:02,564 --> 00:19:13,377
Speaker 0: so that has allowed that unique You know Happenings to happen in basketball first and other sports are largely followers in these.

276
00:19:13,818 --> 00:19:18,680
Speaker 0: in these things Yeah, but you know individual sports have a long history right in this right?

277
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,591
Speaker 0: You know your your Olympics plenty of politics in the Olympics.

278
00:19:22,832 --> 00:19:25,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, right you got your I think Naomi.

279
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,664
Speaker 0: I was like I refuse to play tennis.

280
00:19:27,025 --> 00:19:27,246
Speaker 0: Yep.

281
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,169
Speaker 1: I saw that like.

282
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:40,184
Speaker 1: that's what this situation is evolving rapidly and even if the NBA resumes play I Suspect a lot of the other teams in other sports and leagues will not resume play and The situation is fluid.

283
00:19:40,586 --> 00:19:41,428
Speaker 1: pay attention to this.

284
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:50,100
Speaker 1: the biggest like a general strike could possibly Be the impetus to solve a lot of our racial violence problems in America.

285
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:58,939
Speaker 0: I want to see some strikes and like you know some other entertainment like really you know just imagine I just want TV to turn off, but look the writers strike.

286
00:19:59,522 --> 00:20:01,328
Speaker 1: Shittier TV made just as much money.

287
00:20:01,348 --> 00:20:04,379
Speaker 1: in fact probably made more money because it's the quality didn't actually matter.

288
00:20:04,399 --> 00:20:06,460
Speaker 0: well That's because they only lost writers.

289
00:20:06,681 --> 00:20:11,340
Speaker 0: I'm saying like that like the people who are keeping the TV on go on strike.

290
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,744
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's literally.

291
00:20:12,964 --> 00:20:18,460
Speaker 0: people go to their cable box, and there is nothing on right like they can't even find someone.

292
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,511
Speaker 1: Oh, you want to talk about that?

293
00:20:19,531 --> 00:20:20,420
Speaker 0: run the machinery?

294
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,760
Speaker 0: What if the broadcast reruns that know the optic console room network?

295
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:29,260
Speaker 1: Admins at tier 2 ISPs could go on strike and the internet would stop working in about three weeks.

296
00:20:30,482 --> 00:20:31,793
Speaker 0: That's also like the whole internet.

297
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:32,599
Speaker 1: We should stop working.

298
00:20:33,721 --> 00:20:43,678
Speaker 0: I'm not kidding people at like say for ice and get us turn off everyone's phones And even if the Verizon CEO is like he wouldn't be able to find someone to turn them back on.

299
00:20:43,739 --> 00:20:46,165
Speaker 1: yeah But here's there's the key.

300
00:20:46,426 --> 00:21:14,067
Speaker 1: the part of the reason why we haven't had like a general strike to respond to the rise of fascism In the murder of black people in America is that if you strike even if you is an organization like a even a powerful union if Enough other people don't strike at the same time to give you a critical mass for the movement to succeed Then you basically suffer all the consequences of your style strike personally with no Positive outcome like you.

301
00:21:14,248 --> 00:21:17,080
Speaker 0: if you look like you know the spectrum strike is still ongoing.

302
00:21:17,181 --> 00:21:17,824
Speaker 0: I believe right.

303
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:25,159
Speaker 0: so the an ISP slash cable company in New York spectrum who used to be Time Warner the evil bad one that you try to avoid?

304
00:21:25,179 --> 00:21:32,640
Speaker 0: yeah All of their like support workers the ones that would drive around in vans fixing people's cable, right?

305
00:21:33,621 --> 00:21:37,920
Speaker 0: They basically have been on strike for a very long time now the longest strike in US history.

306
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:40,892
Speaker 1: Okay, I found an article that's talking about it.

307
00:21:41,516 --> 00:21:42,079
Speaker 1: It's still ongoing.

308
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:49,753
Speaker 0: I assume all those people are just doing other jobs now because they're all skilled And spectrum just has like independent contractors.

309
00:21:49,773 --> 00:21:55,146
Speaker 0: You know doing that all that work There's a bunch of scabs doing work Who've been doing it for a while now.

310
00:21:55,787 --> 00:22:08,748
Speaker 0: if you call spectrum to get help a scab will come to you know to do the work for you And that's that's like yeah, it's like I really want that strike to succeed, but so far It's just been a failure.

311
00:22:08,808 --> 00:22:10,419
Speaker 0: all they basically did was quit.

312
00:22:11,521 --> 00:22:12,664
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that's the problem.

313
00:22:12,805 --> 00:22:13,507
Speaker 0: get anything.

314
00:22:13,727 --> 00:22:17,639
Speaker 1: if you take a stand by just quitting your job someone just replaces you.

315
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:23,423
Speaker 0: like Visually quitting you're effectively quitting because you didn't show up And then they just fire you.

316
00:22:23,724 --> 00:22:33,151
Speaker 1: very few people are actually that critical to a company to where you striking by yourself Or just your team striking would actually force of change.

317
00:22:33,593 --> 00:22:41,100
Speaker 1: and even then even if you do that Your company might have not have enough power to actually force a change in broader society.

318
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,707
Speaker 0: No reason for me to strike my come.

319
00:22:44,727 --> 00:22:45,711
Speaker 0: what's my company gonna do?

320
00:22:45,811 --> 00:22:47,718
Speaker 0: I can't put pressure on them to what they're like.

321
00:22:47,758 --> 00:22:48,931
Speaker 0: we already agree.

322
00:22:49,114 --> 00:22:53,649
Speaker 1: yes Like my company is formally endorsed Biden like it's formed like that.

323
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,053
Speaker 1: They're issuing statements.

324
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:56,617
Speaker 1: They're donating money to these causes.

325
00:22:56,738 --> 00:23:00,851
Speaker 0: It's But yeah, the other thing is that you know an NBA player on strike.

326
00:23:00,891 --> 00:23:03,038
Speaker 0: It's like even the lowest NBA player.

327
00:23:03,058 --> 00:23:03,560
Speaker 0: They got money.

328
00:23:04,302 --> 00:23:09,858
Speaker 0: It's like yeah, they're losing money if they don't play possibly, but if none of them play the NBA can't make money.

329
00:23:09,939 --> 00:23:14,477
Speaker 0: so now But some of the star players are still gonna be.

330
00:23:14,497 --> 00:23:15,643
Speaker 0: just fine They're there.

331
00:23:15,784 --> 00:23:19,740
Speaker 0: there are players who would lose some money, but they're not gonna be starving or homeless.

332
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,027
Speaker 0: They all have even the lowest NBA totem.

333
00:23:22,047 --> 00:23:26,380
Speaker 0: pole player right is making enough that they're not gonna be starving right?

334
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:35,119
Speaker 0: They might lose a significant amount of their income, and you know it could be hurt to them relatively speak But they're not gonna be starving.

335
00:23:35,561 --> 00:23:50,512
Speaker 0: but if so, but if a spectrum worker goes on strike if some Verizon tech dude right or You know this did someone at your local Starbucks right the baristas go on strike It's like yeah, those people could be homeless very quickly right.

336
00:23:50,552 --> 00:23:52,940
Speaker 0: so it's you did much harder for them to go on strike.

337
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,156
Speaker 0: They need to basically a guarantee of success to even start.

338
00:23:56,377 --> 00:24:01,959
Speaker 0: yeah, right Whereas here the NBA someone like that they can afford to go on strike and fail and just go back to work.

339
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:16,094
Speaker 1: So my hope is that even if this does not continue immediately that it was a sign that these groups are willing to do this again and May hopefully a movement will come out of this because the whole all of America is talking about it.

340
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:18,161
Speaker 1: like they they succeeded in one Thing.

341
00:24:18,221 --> 00:24:20,532
Speaker 1: this is now the front of the news.

342
00:24:21,074 --> 00:24:26,555
Speaker 0: if they succeeded in nothing else It was teaching people how to strike again Maybe or showing people that it's still a thing.

343
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:28,485
Speaker 1: yep Because that might be.

344
00:24:28,525 --> 00:24:31,378
Speaker 1: there's might come a time where that's the only tool we've got left before.

345
00:24:31,418 --> 00:24:35,199
Speaker 1: it gets to very much different and more dire tools.

346
00:24:44,251 --> 00:24:48,190
Speaker 1: but anyway things Of the day, what do you got?

347
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:49,613
Speaker 0: What do I have?

348
00:24:49,653 --> 00:24:51,441
Speaker 0: so you all know how whip works?

349
00:24:51,863 --> 00:24:52,907
Speaker 1: I don't think most people do I?

350
00:24:54,091 --> 00:24:57,453
Speaker 1: I don't think most people actually know how it works or how fucking dangerous They are.

351
00:24:57,493 --> 00:24:58,559
Speaker 1: and if you don't know how it works.

352
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,505
Speaker 1: You should not touch one.

353
00:24:59,525 --> 00:25:02,105
Speaker 0: well Yeah, if you don't know how whip works you shouldn't touch one.

354
00:25:02,146 --> 00:25:03,846
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz you're gonna Put your own word out.

355
00:25:04,553 --> 00:25:05,721
Speaker 0: Go to go to the internet.

356
00:25:05,762 --> 00:25:06,830
Speaker 0: type in how does a whip work?

357
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:14,766
Speaker 0: But you know the long and short of it is that a wave goes down the whip be Speeds up and then at the end the very tip of the whip breaks the sound barrier and goes crack.

358
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:15,770
Speaker 0: right okay?

359
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:22,130
Speaker 0: So the question is what if instead of a normal old you know Indiana Jones whip right?

360
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:35,750
Speaker 0: right you went out and got yourself a big-ass chain like a Big chain way big and you whip that chain And the end of the chain breaks the sound barrier.

361
00:25:37,853 --> 00:25:38,525
Speaker 0: That's scary.

362
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:44,550
Speaker 1: Video is scary because there's way too many people way too close to that chain.

363
00:25:44,952 --> 00:25:48,849
Speaker 0: Yeah, this guy basically whips the chain and then starts running away from it.

364
00:25:49,311 --> 00:25:52,302
Speaker 1: But then other people are like crowding around like who let me watch?

365
00:25:52,382 --> 00:25:54,008
Speaker 0: people are standing too close to it.

366
00:25:54,289 --> 00:25:55,436
Speaker 0: luckily No one is hurt.

367
00:25:55,496 --> 00:25:59,194
Speaker 0: the video is very short, but yeah Still awesome video.

368
00:25:59,495 --> 00:26:01,662
Speaker 1: so when I was a kid I was time you do this.

369
00:26:01,923 --> 00:26:03,830
Speaker 0: stand further away and run faster.

370
00:26:04,274 --> 00:26:18,887
Speaker 1: I was at farm city week which is like the local fair in like Macomb County when I was a kid and there's like carny rides there and we were waiting in line to ride like one of the carny rides like a spinning thing and My parents hated the fact that I always wanted to ride these dodgy carny rides like.

371
00:26:18,907 --> 00:26:24,890
Speaker 1: they really Really did not want us to ride these rides, and they always ended up giving in and letting us ride the rides.

372
00:26:25,765 --> 00:26:27,639
Speaker 1: But These rides were not safe.

373
00:26:27,821 --> 00:26:29,050
Speaker 0: obviously no kidding.

374
00:26:29,391 --> 00:26:35,013
Speaker 1: So we're in line and the chain that drives like the center shaft to one of these spinning things snapped.

375
00:26:35,374 --> 00:26:41,254
Speaker 1: so now it was a. it was no longer a circle it was just one long whip and It did this thing.

376
00:26:41,274 --> 00:26:42,158
Speaker 1: it like flew out of.

377
00:26:42,258 --> 00:26:45,010
Speaker 1: it flew out like I saw it fly outward.

378
00:26:45,431 --> 00:26:52,290
Speaker 1: It didn't hit anyone somehow and then right at the end it went crack and it hit a tree and the tree fucking fell over.

379
00:26:53,051 --> 00:26:55,544
Speaker 0: That's right, and then it was chaos everywhere.

380
00:26:55,825 --> 00:26:59,856
Speaker 1: people thought they were hurt But they weren't like police showed up and firefighters It was.

381
00:27:00,301 --> 00:27:03,966
Speaker 1: it was a really fun Spectacle that we didn't get to see because my parents were like we're getting the fuck out of here.

382
00:27:03,986 --> 00:27:04,529
Speaker 1: that drove us home.

383
00:27:05,192 --> 00:27:06,136
Speaker 0: Luckily no one was hurt.

384
00:27:06,377 --> 00:27:07,201
Speaker 1: Yeah, no one was hurt.

385
00:27:07,241 --> 00:27:10,232
Speaker 1: It was a miracle, but that was Terrifying.

386
00:27:10,353 --> 00:27:13,346
Speaker 1: cuz I of course a little kid wouldn't people like.

387
00:27:13,406 --> 00:27:21,410
Speaker 1: it's understandable Why someone would not understand the danger of a whip motion because it is not intuitive that that thing would go as fast as it.

388
00:27:22,464 --> 00:27:22,590
Speaker 0: Yep.

389
00:27:23,931 --> 00:27:25,718
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's also not intuitive to me.

390
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:34,969
Speaker 0: Why if you're a carnie with a reputation for dangerous rides It's like yeah have your dangerous rides, but I'm gonna maintain those rides as well as like it doesn't cost me more as it does.

391
00:27:35,852 --> 00:27:38,743
Speaker 0: How much more could it cost to just make sure you have a nice chain on there?

392
00:27:38,763 --> 00:27:47,247
Speaker 1: a lot of those places will hire People like local people day laborer just to run the rides and they have like one technician who oversees everything.

393
00:27:47,327 --> 00:27:51,450
Speaker 0: if they are not Yeah, take get the technician to do a good job, but don't let the chain rust.

394
00:27:51,901 --> 00:27:54,254
Speaker 1: Yeah No That is not how those things go.

395
00:27:54,775 --> 00:27:55,236
Speaker 0: tell you what.

396
00:27:55,597 --> 00:28:00,289
Speaker 0: start a carny business and see how much money that's a bad business to be in.

397
00:28:00,871 --> 00:28:04,310
Speaker 0: It's probably a large insurance expenses and low incomes.

398
00:28:04,973 --> 00:28:06,442
Speaker 1: So I was poking out.

399
00:28:06,502 --> 00:28:08,834
Speaker 1: I found a video that went viral But it wasn't as good as the.

400
00:28:09,216 --> 00:28:12,850
Speaker 1: so I went and got like I found a better video of a similar thing.

401
00:28:13,632 --> 00:28:21,754
Speaker 1: You know horror games and horror movies that there's a certain kind of ambient soundtrack and music that's often in the background like Okay stuff.

402
00:28:22,377 --> 00:28:25,169
Speaker 1: Yeah, you ever wonder how they make that sound like that kind of sound?

403
00:28:25,891 --> 00:28:27,734
Speaker 0: I mean it depends which there's a few sounds.

404
00:28:27,775 --> 00:28:34,904
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could you know, so what if I showed you a video of An instrument and I've seen people make these instruments before like.

405
00:28:35,205 --> 00:28:53,590
Speaker 1: there are companies that will either bespoke make these instruments for your horror project or You can hire them and they will basically send people or like work with you to have someone play these instruments To the timing that you want for how you want the horror movie nonsense to go in your thing.

406
00:28:54,294 --> 00:28:57,892
Speaker 1: So what this is is a video of someone demonstrating one of those Instruments.

407
00:28:58,394 --> 00:29:01,442
Speaker 1: a lot of times these are made by a custom instrument.

408
00:29:02,104 --> 00:29:05,569
Speaker 1: This one happens to be called the apprehension engine.

409
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,174
Speaker 0: interesting it's

410
00:29:08,058 --> 00:29:27,107
Speaker 1: a And it's got a hurdy-gurdy style control and a bunch of stuff and if you watch this thing or listen to the one It just sounds like every horror soundtrack ever But - they demonstrate all the different kinds of sounds this can make and how you can combine them.

411
00:29:27,648 --> 00:29:33,450
Speaker 1: This is a Fascinating and complex instrument that I think would be really really fun to play.

412
00:29:34,112 --> 00:29:39,070
Speaker 0: No, well, that's much more impressive than the lightsaber instrument, which is an electric razor and a metal bowl.

413
00:29:42,134 --> 00:29:43,630
Speaker 1: No, this thing is ridiculous.

414
00:29:44,814 --> 00:29:57,328
Speaker 1: All right in the moment We're gonna be live at not well live to tape and not one but two upcoming conventions the virtual crunchyroll expo Which just announced a ton more guests on Friday September 4th at 4 30 p.m.

00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,796
Speaker 1: Competitive games should end.

424
00:30:32,816 --> 00:30:32,876
Speaker 0: Yep.

425
00:30:33,961 --> 00:30:36,129
Speaker 0: So we've already recorded and submitted these.

426
00:30:36,671 --> 00:30:38,521
Speaker 0: So they're gonna play them if they approve them.

427
00:30:38,581 --> 00:30:43,824
Speaker 0: if they don't if they like if they don't find anything They don't like I haven't got an email back telling me to never contact them again.

428
00:30:44,005 --> 00:30:45,090
Speaker 1: So so far so good.

429
00:30:45,772 --> 00:30:48,058
Speaker 0: It seems like they're gonna show them on their channels.

430
00:30:48,178 --> 00:30:52,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, and we'll try to be in the chat rooms associated with these channels.

431
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:55,690
Speaker 1: I think the packs one will have like our Twitter handles like prominent.

432
00:30:56,152 --> 00:31:00,787
Speaker 1: So we might like I might even just like live tweet the panel and like respond.

433
00:31:01,148 --> 00:31:02,293
Speaker 1: Well, we'll see We haven't planned.

00:31:03,699 --> 00:31:05,066
Speaker 0: So it's gonna be twitch.tv.

00:31:05,086 --> 00:31:07,237
Speaker 0: slash packs 3 I presume.

437
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:11,562
Speaker 1: Yep, but the I was once the host of packs 2 in a distant time.

438
00:31:11,582 --> 00:31:13,590
Speaker 0: This is packs 3 at the crunchyroll one.

439
00:31:13,651 --> 00:31:17,257
Speaker 0: I don't know if you have to pay or something But you basically for free.

441
00:31:20,427 --> 00:31:20,668
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

442
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:21,290
Speaker 0: I'll have to do that.

443
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,034
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did it.

444
00:31:22,135 --> 00:31:22,739
Speaker 1: It was painless.

445
00:31:22,779 --> 00:31:23,443
Speaker 1: It seemed to work.

446
00:31:23,685 --> 00:31:25,998
Speaker 1: Like I have a okay I have an attendee badge to this thing.

447
00:31:26,018 --> 00:31:30,985

448
00:31:31,045 --> 00:31:32,030
Speaker 1: it was really straightforward.

449
00:31:32,775 --> 00:31:33,490
Speaker 0: Okay, seems good.

450
00:31:33,638 --> 00:31:45,268
Speaker 1: Yeah I feel like if the free online conventions are the way to go very few people are willing to pay a lot of money for conventions online Though some paid conventions expo crunchyroll.com.

451
00:31:45,308 --> 00:31:45,670
Speaker 0: Here it is.

Speaker 1: So game devs of color online is coming up real soon.

453
00:31:49,321 --> 00:31:51,650

454
00:31:51,851 --> 00:32:00,409
Speaker 1: That is not the place for us to present But I will be attending that because that convention is awesome and the panels there are better than most of the panels I see at other gaming conventions.

455
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:04,036
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm 100% agree with that.

Speaker 0: Yep.

457
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:08,255

473
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:45,781
Speaker 1: We're responding much more to the listener than we have in the last several years Because we're also stuck like we're stuck in the same boat.

474
00:32:45,801 --> 00:32:51,686
Speaker 0: You are I Am now registered for the crunchyroll Expo and my ticket has been activated.

475
00:32:51,726 --> 00:32:54,379
Speaker 1: Yeah So I guess we'll get right into this.

476
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,149
Speaker 1: This was an idea we had because we thought it'd be fun.

477
00:32:56,955 --> 00:33:06,483
Speaker 1: We came up with it randomly while we were doing another show and Basically the gist of it is that one Until relatively recently you could not order things online.

478
00:33:06,523 --> 00:33:24,090
Speaker 1: Like that was a new thing I remember there'd be the blue screen at the end of a TV commercial where you could call a phone number And either read a credit card over the phone or like do COD Which I don't think anyone listening to this will remember or know what collect on delivery was.

479
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,242
Speaker 1: I don't think that's even a thing anymore in the US.

480
00:33:26,423 --> 00:33:29,495
Speaker 0: I think it might still be but yeah The point is is that the there was.

481
00:33:29,996 --> 00:33:32,503
Speaker 0: there was a catalog phone right.

482
00:33:32,523 --> 00:33:34,970
Speaker 0: there were phone and mail-in catalogs, right?

483
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:39,743
Speaker 0: You know shopping from home QVC stuff like that before the the web and the internet.

484
00:33:40,225 --> 00:33:45,690
Speaker 0: the web and the internet came into existence But e-commerce right came a little bit later, right?

485
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:53,539
Speaker 0: So like for example, if you install the doom shareware and you wanted to upgrade to full doom It told you right on the screen.

486
00:33:53,820 --> 00:34:01,970
Speaker 0: Yes, you know send money to this You know call this number or send something to this address and we'll send you back the full version of doom.

487
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,495
Speaker 0: Yeah mail scorched earth.

488
00:34:03,535 --> 00:34:06,164
Speaker 1: They'd send you back the code to unlock the triple tank.

489
00:34:06,927 --> 00:34:10,121
Speaker 1: Yep, exactly I think I ever saw anyone in my life who had that unlocked.

490
00:34:10,926 --> 00:34:11,489
Speaker 0: I didn't either.

491
00:34:14,212 --> 00:34:24,230
Speaker 0: The point is is that in the earliest days of the Internet the E-commerce did exist in like the late 90s in terms of type your credit card info in buy something the way you do now.

492
00:34:24,811 --> 00:34:29,263
Speaker 0: But it was super new and there were a lot of websites that existed.

493
00:34:29,284 --> 00:34:42,750
Speaker 0: that were simply existing businesses that existed before e-commerce existed that had mail-in catalogs or phone shopping and They made websites because it was easy to make a website that just listed their catalog.

494
00:34:43,393 --> 00:34:46,969
Speaker 0: But they did not set up e-commerce because that was hard to do in those days.

495
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:58,728
Speaker 0: So you could just go to their website and then buy from them buy a mail or phone and it wasn't until a few years Later that you know e-commerce was just easy for anyone to set up.

496
00:34:58,808 --> 00:35:05,830
Speaker 0: and nowadays We have things like you could just open up an Amazon seller account you Shopify or you know, all this anyone.

497
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:13,090
Speaker 1: 1999 to 2000 I went from there aren't many things I can buy online - I buy literally everything online.

498
00:35:13,675 --> 00:35:13,877
Speaker 0: Yep.

499
00:35:14,644 --> 00:35:16,773
Speaker 0: in addition You know we've been buying.

500
00:35:16,813 --> 00:35:30,744
Speaker 0: we have earned the unique position of being so old that I've been buying things online as long as buying things online has existed, yep, and websites that you buy things from Keep a history of what you've bought and even if the websites go away.

501
00:35:31,085 --> 00:35:32,310
Speaker 0: You still have your email address.

502
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:34,298
Speaker 0: My email address is super old, right?

503
00:35:34,379 --> 00:35:34,820
Speaker 0: It doesn't go.

504
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,648
Speaker 0: I don't have the very first email address.

505
00:35:36,668 --> 00:35:37,110
Speaker 0: I ever started?

506
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:39,921
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, because some stuff was on my RIT one or I don't?

507
00:35:39,941 --> 00:35:45,095
Speaker 0: yeah, I don't have my full full history But I do have a long history of.

508
00:35:45,256 --> 00:35:55,485
Speaker 0: I can search and look up everything I've bought online and when and if you look at That that gives you sort of a scarily accurate look of like.

509
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:57,230
Speaker 0: this is what your life was.

510
00:35:57,451 --> 00:36:00,882
Speaker 0: This is what the world was at this time on this exact date.

511
00:36:00,922 --> 00:36:03,270
Speaker 0: You bought this thing at this price, right?

512
00:36:03,671 --> 00:36:05,723
Speaker 0: And it's like that's where you were in life.

513
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:06,850
Speaker 0: That's where the world was.

514
00:36:07,091 --> 00:36:16,029
Speaker 0: It's like just by looking at this one thing a single person's online order history from Amazon or somewhere right You can learn so much.

515
00:36:16,511 --> 00:36:31,470
Speaker 0: So we decided to do a show where let's look at our order histories and there will be many Fascinating things to talk about gleamed from the information held within Mostly Amazon, you know, we're not endorsing Amazon there.

516
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:36,670
Speaker 0: Yeah company, but you know, aha I see you also participate in society.

517
00:36:37,754 --> 00:36:42,750
Speaker 1: I do have a short list of things I bought from like the pre history like before.

518
00:36:43,251 --> 00:36:44,802
Speaker 0: Let's talk about that first, right?

519
00:36:44,822 --> 00:36:45,950
Speaker 0: So what did you buy online?

520
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,664
Speaker 0: like So old so long ago.

521
00:36:49,704 --> 00:36:50,650
Speaker 0: You don't really even have a record.

522
00:36:50,650 --> 00:37:02,730
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm not gonna talk about the first thing I ever bought online ever because I bought it by mailing cash in an envelope to some guy Who then opened up a BBS account so I could download wares?

523
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:11,429
Speaker 1: But it was 1996 Because I wanted to have an account on Sierra's the realm the first graphical MMO.

524
00:37:11,651 --> 00:37:13,830
Speaker 0: No, I guess that counts as an online purchase.

525
00:37:14,092 --> 00:37:23,570
Speaker 1: so you literally you put your credit card number into a website and Like did stuff and then your account would activate and I did this with my parents credit card.

526
00:37:23,892 --> 00:37:31,690
Speaker 1: That was the first time I ever completed a transaction Entirely online without mailing a check or cash or something.

527
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,574
Speaker 1: 1996.

528
00:37:33,574 --> 00:37:36,790
Speaker 0: yeah, I guess AOL had a lot of things I could have like extra stuff.

529
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:39,563
Speaker 0: You could have put a credit card in for to get more stuff, right?

530
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:41,010
Speaker 0: Like you go to a well channel.

531
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:41,813
Speaker 0: It's like yay.

532
00:37:41,853 --> 00:37:42,918
Speaker 0: to do this thing cost money.

533
00:37:42,938 --> 00:37:44,625
Speaker 0: I would just never do anything that cost money.

534
00:37:44,725 --> 00:37:47,779
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much like Oh, I don't want mad maze to be better.

535
00:37:47,819 --> 00:37:48,583
Speaker 1: I don't give a shit.

536
00:37:48,964 --> 00:37:50,712
Speaker 0: Yeah, no zero times I did that.

537
00:37:50,832 --> 00:37:56,329
Speaker 0: the first things I bought online were mostly computer parts for my first computer that I built in the late 90s.

538
00:37:57,934 --> 00:38:00,696
Speaker 0: some of those things I Ordered by.

539
00:38:00,716 --> 00:38:16,610
Speaker 0: I think it's like TC computers had a website But there was also a website by calm which is like that one of the first big e-commerce sites Apparently it's now owned by Rakuten, but they had like buy calm which is just buying stuff.

540
00:38:17,252 --> 00:38:21,610
Speaker 0: But the one I went to was by comp calm which is selling computer stuff specifically.

541
00:38:22,192 --> 00:38:37,305
Speaker 0: So the way it worked is I would go there I would add stuff to my cart check out then it would print a piece of paper Write a personal check put it with the piece of paper in an envelope mail it and after the personal check cleared Then they would send me the stuff that I had ordered.

542
00:38:37,346 --> 00:38:38,170
Speaker 0: so it took a while.

543
00:38:39,272 --> 00:38:43,310
Speaker 0: It was faster than you think but still obviously slower than one-click shopping.

544
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:46,943
Speaker 0: Yeah, what we have today with a credit card and whatnot or PayPal or anything.

545
00:38:46,964 --> 00:38:47,285
Speaker 0: Yeah, there were.

546
00:38:47,305 --> 00:38:48,690
Speaker 0: no there were no paypals.

547
00:38:48,851 --> 00:38:57,663
Speaker 0: Basically PayPal didn't exist yet quite yet You know Or any other sort of Apple pays or any payment mechanisms.

548
00:38:57,724 --> 00:39:07,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, well cuz like in 1999 I wanted to get anime fan subs and I did a transaction online But then I had to mail a check to the guy because he didn't have a way to process credit cards.

549
00:39:08,211 --> 00:39:11,489
Speaker 0: Yep, PayPal came into existence in what year?

550
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:16,130
Speaker 1: Let's say I've never had a PayPal account ever and I refused to use it my whole life.

551
00:39:16,452 --> 00:39:17,681
Speaker 1: I got away with that December.

552
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:19,911
Speaker 0: December of 98.

553
00:39:19,911 --> 00:39:24,250
Speaker 1: PayPal came I remember in 98 like I didn't fucking trust PayPal and refused to use it.

554
00:39:24,752 --> 00:39:35,728
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but a PayPal now is pretty is actually kind of trustworthy especially if you're gonna shop if you're gonna buy use it because Sometimes you go to a site where you don't trust that e-commerce site.

555
00:39:35,768 --> 00:39:41,530
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, right and it's like oh, it's just some guys like, you know tiny little e-commerce store.

556
00:39:41,992 --> 00:39:46,430
Speaker 0: It's like well, I'll use PayPal because I don't want to put my credit card info onto this weird site, right?

557
00:39:47,732 --> 00:39:51,850
Speaker 0: And PayPal is actually mostly good for if you're a customer buying stuff with it.

558
00:39:52,311 --> 00:39:56,242
Speaker 0: I just would not recommend it even today as a store receiving money.

559
00:39:56,283 --> 00:40:05,070
Speaker 1: You can get grifted by them in quite a few ways Yeah, but so my first actual Transactional purchase that is the thing I bought with the credit card myself.

560
00:40:05,251 --> 00:40:08,926
Speaker 1: No, shenanigans anything was in the year 2000 right before I went to college.

561
00:40:09,327 --> 00:40:11,213
Speaker 1: I spent almost $4,000.

562
00:40:11,213 --> 00:40:25,675
Speaker 1: I cashed in every bond that every relative had ever bought for me in my entire life and I bought an Athlon k7 800 and on every component I needed to build a computer That I was gonna bring to RIT from egghead.com.

563
00:40:25,775 --> 00:40:29,220
Speaker 1: new egg is called new egg because nerds wanted egghead to come back.

564
00:40:29,882 --> 00:40:33,293
Speaker 0: The egghead died and went out of business or closed or whatever.

565
00:40:33,775 --> 00:40:35,259
Speaker 0: and then they're like someone's like.

566
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:51,819
Speaker 1: well There's clearly a demand for this business of selling computer parts and an egghead was so crazy like compare like Normal e-commerce was not great in the year 2000 yet, but egghead was like hey nerd Here's nerd shit, and it's really straightforward like search by spec.

567
00:40:52,882 --> 00:40:55,756
Speaker 1: Yeah, here's all the RAM you can buy based on the spec you put in.

568
00:40:55,796 --> 00:40:56,500
Speaker 1: pick the ones you want.

569
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:56,901
Speaker 1: It was.

570
00:40:58,265 --> 00:40:59,890
Speaker 1: I would just hang out like poking her out of that site.

571
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:03,100
Speaker 0: making wish lists and other e-commerce sites were not yet.

572
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,860
Speaker 0: So in those days even Amazon was still selling books only.

573
00:41:06,941 --> 00:41:08,999
Speaker 0: But basically yeah, right there weren't you know?

574
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:16,199
Speaker 0: Buy.com was sort of like the only one that was like selling a bunch of stuff and even like I said they had different sites For each different product category, right?

575
00:41:17,861 --> 00:41:22,940
Speaker 0: So, you know, it was the only place like to buy computers online was from a computer only place.

576
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,824
Speaker 0: They went out of business.

577
00:41:23,844 --> 00:41:30,973
Speaker 0: new egg came into existence as basically like hey nerds now Here's a you know, you what you like new egg and it's gone shop here.

578
00:41:30,993 --> 00:41:32,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, that seemed to be a smart move.

579
00:41:33,563 --> 00:41:38,195
Speaker 0: I don't know why egghead couldn't continue doing what they did Instead of letting new egg come around.

580
00:41:38,235 --> 00:41:39,582
Speaker 0: but hey, yeah We have it now.

581
00:41:39,703 --> 00:41:47,855
Speaker 1: so but the notable thing is what I the two things I bought in this other than the Athlon k7 Is the Plex tor Scuzzy CD burner and a 21 inch CRT?

582
00:41:50,061 --> 00:41:53,170
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, so I went to Amazon.

583
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:53,490
Speaker 0: calm.

584
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:56,379
Speaker 0: so the oldest things I bought were computer parts from buy.com, right?

585
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,254
Speaker 0: But the oldest thing of my Amazon history is obviously books from 1999.

586
00:42:01,254 --> 00:42:03,080
Speaker 1: No, I never bought books on Amazon.

587
00:42:03,942 --> 00:42:07,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually I then I bought a CD later in summer of night.

588
00:42:09,004 --> 00:42:11,008
Speaker 0: So I guess they added CDs pretty early on.

589
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:12,973
Speaker 0: the first book guy.

590
00:42:13,013 --> 00:42:13,635
Speaker 0: This is great.

591
00:42:13,655 --> 00:42:20,920
Speaker 0: You couldn't have planned you could not have planned this Right, it's like it's like I did this on purpose so that I could say it was true.

592
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,026
Speaker 0: But I can prove that it's true right.

593
00:42:23,266 --> 00:42:34,959
Speaker 0: the first book that I ever bought on amazon.com on February 10th, 1999 21 years ago is catch-22 Joseph Eller.

594
00:42:36,523 --> 00:42:36,845
Speaker 0: It's like.

595
00:42:36,926 --> 00:42:41,839
Speaker 0: it's like I was thinking like, huh, you know This is the whole world is changing.

596
00:42:42,888 --> 00:42:56,682
Speaker 0: Let me Write like christen this new world By by buying the perfect first book on Amazon Like you would go back in time to intentionally make this the first book Right.

597
00:42:57,203 --> 00:43:06,362
Speaker 1: I bought the first thing I ever bought on Amazon was in 2004 and it was the Simpsons fourth season DVD box set for $35.

598
00:43:06,362 --> 00:43:06,482
Speaker 1: Yep.

599

Speaker 0: Yeah if I go ahead.

601
00:43:09,031 --> 00:43:13,766
Speaker 0: so I didn't really buy anything on Amazon after 99 Until we get to 2002.

602
00:43:13,766 --> 00:43:16,013
Speaker 0: So this is like midway through college.

603
00:43:16,033 --> 00:43:16,334
Speaker 0: Yep.

604
00:43:16,795 --> 00:43:17,939

Speaker 0: I bought a gundam seed DVD, I guess in Oh five.

609
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:29,220
Speaker 0: I think that was after media play.

610
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,836
Speaker 1: Oh, there's so many DVDs in my Amazon history.

611
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:33,602

612
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:39,600
Speaker 0: I got box sets one and two complete first and second seasons of Rocky and Bullwinkle.

613
00:43:39,741 --> 00:43:41,247

614
00:43:41,407 --> 00:43:42,532
Speaker 1: I remember those.

615
00:43:42,552 --> 00:43:44,460
Speaker 1: I remember those exact DVDs.

616
00:43:45,641 --> 00:43:48,032
Speaker 0: Here is a D&D players handbook three and a half.

617
00:43:48,072 --> 00:43:49,801
Speaker 0: So I guess that was in 2006.

618
00:43:49,801 --> 00:43:50,147
Speaker 0: So that was.

619
00:43:50,188 --> 00:43:57,120
Speaker 0: we were in beacon But I had lost access to a game store right because I was buying my nerdy stuff at Millennium when I was in college.

620
00:43:57,221 --> 00:43:59,076
Speaker 0: Right, so that was not being bought online.

621
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:04,134
Speaker 0: Yeah But here we see having to buy stuff online because the nerd store is gone.

622
00:44:04,154 --> 00:44:06,080
Speaker 0: I'm buying lots of comic books.

623
00:44:06,161 --> 00:44:07,777
Speaker 0: I bought a copy of paranoia XP.

624
00:44:07,817 --> 00:44:08,100
Speaker 0: It's funny.

625
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:08,642
Speaker 1: You can see.

626
00:44:08,662 --> 00:44:14,784
Speaker 1: I like, you know, I'm looking at this because there's a pivotal purchase on October of 2005. here I'll get to in a second.

627
00:44:14,804 --> 00:44:22,680
Speaker 1: But basically you see me buying mostly like DVD box sets of like classic things until we leave college.

628
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:27,372
Speaker 1: Then I bought so much media like in that era before.

629
00:44:27,412 --> 00:44:30,120

638
00:45:06,979 --> 00:45:17,097
Speaker 1: oh that is when I replaced the stick microphone and then and the bullshit microphones that we bought from Radio Shack with a Real mixer for the first time.

639
00:45:17,158 --> 00:45:22,814
Speaker 1: it cost $50 and Amazon is really sad to tell me that the return window closed on November 28 2005.

640
00:45:22,814 --> 00:45:36,854
Speaker 0: I can't return it Yeah, but yeah, you look at like, you know 2007 right, so this is I guess I think by this time Maybe like I had my second job after college or close to it, right?

00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:38,820
Speaker 0: So I'm buying all kinds.

642
00:45:39,061 --> 00:45:40,366
Speaker 0: You know, it's like I graduated college.

643
00:45:40,386 --> 00:45:44,200
Speaker 0: I'm buying all the nerdy stuff that I couldn't afford earlier in life, right?

644
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,188
Speaker 1: Yeah, the sword problems started to happen.

Speaker 1: have money.

646
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:53,680

647
00:45:54,362 --> 00:45:55,727
Speaker 1: So many games.

648
00:45:55,807 --> 00:45:58,496
Speaker 1: I feel like I bought a DS game like every month for that period.

649
00:45:58,898 --> 00:46:02,780
Speaker 0: right manga Here's a Pokemon pearl pre-sell stylus.

650
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:09,806
Speaker 0: I guess when Pokemon pearl came out there was a special exclusive stylus that you could get As a pre-order bonus.

651
00:46:09,846 --> 00:46:13,839
Speaker 0: you see that in here right as long as Pokemon games coming out.

652
00:46:13,919 --> 00:46:21,104
Speaker 1: Yeah it's basically all video games and media here and And Not much else.

653
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:22,508
Speaker 1: Oh and this is interesting.

654
00:46:22,568 --> 00:46:36,700
Speaker 1: I didn't start buying household goods until around 2008 like that's when suddenly mundane crap appears in my Amazon like Hairdryer a bucket some batteries like that's when I think I Amazon expanded a bit to sell just stuff

655
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:36,941
Speaker 0: Yep,

656
00:46:37,343 --> 00:46:37,947
Speaker 1: and when I stopped

657
00:46:37,967 --> 00:46:42,251
Speaker 0: going to stores, we got the pizza stone I ordered that broke several times the

658
00:46:42,291 --> 00:46:43,920
Speaker 1: waffle maker that got fungus.

659
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:47,135
Speaker 0: We got the giant crock pot.

660
00:46:47,155 --> 00:46:47,859
Speaker 0: That was too big.

661
00:46:49,081 --> 00:46:52,772
Speaker 0: My eyes are iron that I still have to this day that I still use.

662
00:46:53,154 --> 00:46:55,802
Speaker 1: Yep, cuz that 2009 2010 Especially.

663
00:46:55,822 --> 00:47:02,212
Speaker 1: that's when we were moving to the city and suddenly you see me buying like a lot of light bulbs bunch of coat hangers.

664
00:47:02,232 --> 00:47:05,831
Speaker 1: Oh Wow, still even in 2009.

665
00:47:05,831 --> 00:47:10,652
Speaker 1: I bought a giant pack of CD RW's Yep, a whole bunch of eneloop batteries.

666
00:47:10,672 --> 00:47:14,591
Speaker 1: We discovered eneloop battery But I think we both bought the eneloop at exactly the same time.

667
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:15,896
Speaker 0: Prince of Nothing books.

668
00:47:16,539 --> 00:47:26,314
Speaker 1: Yeah Embarrassingly, I see an order where I bought three copies of Some fantasy novel and three copies of the God Delusion.

669
00:47:26,334 --> 00:47:31,179
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure those were gifts for relatives Because we didn't know Richard Dawkins was a piece of shit back then.

670
00:47:31,781 --> 00:47:35,391
Speaker 0: Here's the knife block that I still have in my kitchen in 2009.

671
00:47:35,391 --> 00:47:37,276
Speaker 1: Yep, but it's interesting to like.

672
00:47:37,296 --> 00:47:48,400
Speaker 1: it's weird to see this transition of like buying Computer technology online because nothing else is online to buying all Nerd media online because it was cheaper than going to the store.

673
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:51,893
Speaker 1: Like I wasn't buying DS games on Amazon because it was easier.

674
00:47:51,974 --> 00:47:53,580
Speaker 1: I was buying it because it was cheaper than GameStop.

675
00:47:55,342 --> 00:48:00,800
Speaker 1: But then there's a sudden switch of only buying nerdy stuff online to literally buying everything online.

676
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:13,500
Speaker 1: Like as I go to 2010 2011, it's obvious that this is replaced Almost every store for me and I literally just don't buy anything anywhere except on Amazon or Sweetwater or Newegg.

677
00:48:14,083 --> 00:48:24,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, once you get to 2010 20 2009 2010 It's like each year is several pages of orders versus the previous years mostly fit onto one page.

678
00:48:24,942 --> 00:48:29,226
Speaker 1: Oh, there are 14 pages of orders from 2019 on Amazon.

679
00:48:29,868 --> 00:48:30,330
Speaker 0: Oh, let's see.

680
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:30,792
Speaker 0: What's you think?

681
00:48:30,812 --> 00:48:31,053
Speaker 0: Yeah.

682
00:48:31,073 --> 00:48:31,775
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

683
00:48:31,896 --> 00:48:32,940
Speaker 0: It's my whole life.

684
00:48:33,321 --> 00:48:36,369
Speaker 1: Everything I bought is I is here in 2009.

685
00:48:36,369 --> 00:48:38,755
Speaker 0: I have how many pages hold on?

686
00:48:39,035 --> 00:48:42,669
Speaker 1: say 14 is what I got Six pages.

687
00:48:42,689 --> 00:48:54,111
Speaker 1: Oh But I bought less than you last year, you know, what's depressing though, you know what I bought on December 11th Risk legacy, you know what remains unopened in my closet.

688
00:48:54,793 --> 00:48:55,876
Speaker 0: I think we opened it.

689
00:48:56,318 --> 00:48:57,000
Speaker 1: We never played it.

690
00:48:57,121 --> 00:48:58,052
Speaker 1: I know we never played it.

691
00:48:59,642 --> 00:49:01,249
Speaker 1: Maybe we definitely never played it.

692
00:49:02,153 --> 00:49:04,781
Speaker 1: I bought it in 2011.

693
00:49:04,781 --> 00:49:16,631
Speaker 0: It's really strange to see stuff that like I own I still have I still use I still know I have right yet Somehow it's like I really have had it for that long.

694
00:49:16,691 --> 00:49:20,205
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm feeling that with a lot of things Here we go.

695
00:49:20,225 --> 00:49:20,486
Speaker 0: Here we go.

696
00:49:20,507 --> 00:49:26,029
Speaker 0: For example, here's a here's a seven pack of Headbands right for my head, right?

697
00:49:26,049 --> 00:49:26,733
Speaker 0: This is from 2012, right?

698
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:40,782
Speaker 0: So I guess I've been bald longer than 2012 and I guess around that time I realized somehow that I was oh, yeah Cuz look I bought the crappy bike trainer that I got rid of for the $50 one Right.

699
00:49:40,822 --> 00:49:55,100
Speaker 0: around the same time and I guess it looks like a week later I realized that sweat pouring from my head was a problem and I ordered a seven pack of sweat bands Right for my head and I'm still using those ten dollars for seven sweat bands.

700
00:49:55,824 --> 00:49:58,380
Speaker 0: I was just using those the other day on this vastly superior.

701
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:01,794
Speaker 1: So last weekend I went rollerblading a bunch cuz like I used to rollerblade a lot cuz.

702
00:50:01,814 --> 00:50:05,116
Speaker 1: I grew up in the 80s and 90s Like that was the thing just to go to roller rings.

703
00:50:06,004 --> 00:50:13,160
Speaker 1: When I moved to New York, I had rollerblades But they were so old that the technology had advanced to the point that they were obsolete and dangerous.

704
00:50:13,622 --> 00:50:16,360
Speaker 1: They're also broken because I'd worn them out at RIT because it was poor.

705
00:50:17,002 --> 00:50:19,792
Speaker 1: So I bought new rollerblades and I can see here.

706
00:50:20,133 --> 00:50:21,980
Speaker 1: in 2009 I bought wrist guards.

707
00:50:23,102 --> 00:50:24,091
Speaker 1: Those are the same wrist guards.

708
00:50:24,131 --> 00:50:25,059
Speaker 1: I'm still using today.

709
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,386
Speaker 1: Yep, I can't believe.

710
00:50:27,426 --> 00:50:28,611
Speaker 1: I bought them in 2009.

711
00:50:28,611 --> 00:50:30,800
Speaker 1: I bought them as soon as I moved to New York.

712
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:31,302
Speaker 1: That's almost.

713
00:50:31,342 --> 00:50:37,601
Speaker 1: that's literally one of the first things I bought when I moved to New York City was wrist guards so I could rollerblade Mm-hmm.

714
00:50:38,565 --> 00:50:39,367
Speaker 1: I guess you know why.

715
00:50:39,407 --> 00:50:40,491
Speaker 1: you know why I got.

716
00:50:40,531 --> 00:50:46,470
Speaker 1: this is interest reminding me of my life because in Beacon I didn't rollerblade because there was nowhere to rollerblade.

717
00:50:46,511 --> 00:50:47,995
Speaker 1: that was safe in the suburbs.

718
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,323
Speaker 1: I Moved to the city.

719
00:50:50,343 --> 00:50:51,407
Speaker 1: I can rollerblade.

720
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:54,960
Speaker 1: I bought rollerblades and I bought like new rollerblades and then I bought our wrist guards.

721
00:50:55,901 --> 00:51:01,077
Speaker 0: This is like better than any kind of like diary you could use to like remember your life, right?

722
00:51:01,197 --> 00:51:02,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, what did you buy?

723
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,368
Speaker 0: What did you buy when it's like?

724
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:07,640
Speaker 0: Oh look, you know, I started buying camera stuff.

725
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:08,827
Speaker 0: I guess that's what I got it.

726
00:51:08,847 --> 00:51:12,522
Speaker 0: I know exactly now when I got interested in 2011.

727
00:51:12,522 --> 00:51:20,101
Speaker 1: there's like three full pages of skiing shit because that was when I went from skiing kinda to like being super serial about skiing Right.

728
00:51:20,502 --> 00:51:24,693
Speaker 0: Oh, look, that's when I bought the canvas bag to hold coins in.

729
00:51:24,733 --> 00:51:27,380
Speaker 0: that's when I started having to do laundry with coins.

730
00:51:28,102 --> 00:51:29,706
Speaker 0: Oh, look, that's where I bought a bike pump.

731
00:51:29,746 --> 00:51:31,571
Speaker 0: I guess that's when I started biking more.

732
00:51:31,651 --> 00:51:32,373
Speaker 0: Seriously.

733
00:51:32,514 --> 00:51:36,370
Speaker 0: Oh, that's when I bought the razors to Clippers to shave my head.

734
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:37,780
Speaker 0: That's when I started shaving my head.

735
00:51:38,162 --> 00:51:41,260
Speaker 0: Oh, that's when I bought a second television because the first one got burgled.

736
00:51:42,461 --> 00:51:49,059
Speaker 0: It's like you can see all these life events to the basically the exact day, but just from what you bought only, right?

737
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:52,999
Speaker 0: Which is why you know privacy concerns are a thing.

738
00:51:53,521 --> 00:51:58,719
Speaker 1: Yeah, this data could definitely be used to figure things out about me as I'm looking through these things I've bought.

739
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:09,097
Speaker 1: But uh, the other thing I noticed going through this over the years I bought increasingly be like expensive large like things on Amazon up to a point.

740
00:52:09,679 --> 00:52:27,650
Speaker 1: but around 2015 I stopped buying them on Amazon and I start buying them directly from the manufacturer or directly from a handful of industry specialty resellers like Sweetwater or B&H Instead of being a not a fan.

741
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:32,987
Speaker 1: Oh, I hate being like I don't buy things from B&H anymore But there were some things that you could like.

742
00:52:33,227 --> 00:52:45,990
Speaker 1: if you tried to buy LED panels like like studio lighting on Amazon in like 2010 it was all like dangerous garbage But B&H had professional lights.

743
00:52:46,191 --> 00:52:47,477
Speaker 1: So I bought professional lights from B&H.

744
00:52:48,441 --> 00:52:56,127
Speaker 0: Yeah, I noticed that there's like a. there was like a spike of buying stuff right at times when I moved Yeah, 2009.

745
00:52:56,127 --> 00:52:58,360
Speaker 1: I bought a shit ton of stuff, right?

746
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:01,900
Speaker 0: And you know times of my life situation changed.

747
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,740
Speaker 0: I had to buy a lot of stuff and then it basically it's like as eventually it's like over time.

748
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:08,603
Speaker 0: It's like now my.

749
00:53:08,744 --> 00:53:11,614
Speaker 0: you know, not only do I bring stuff from a previous places.

750
00:53:11,674 --> 00:53:21,553
Speaker 0: I've lived but it's like I've really especially recently right and not just because of the pandemic or whatever but like Buying the amount of stuff I buy.

751
00:53:21,574 --> 00:53:24,367
Speaker 0: it's not like I'm buying nothing But it just goes way down.

752
00:53:24,447 --> 00:53:29,911
Speaker 0: more and more of the stuff I buy is simply restocking Yep, sumable consumables.

753
00:53:29,931 --> 00:53:31,800
Speaker 1: Like what am I buying in 2020?

754
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:40,024
Speaker 1: Like I'm going back to my list other than I bought a ton of stuff for our panel production pipeline because the pandemic but that's That's a special circumstance.

755
00:53:40,044 --> 00:53:41,528
Speaker 0: batteries dishwasher.

756
00:53:41,568 --> 00:53:43,454
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's see fun batteries.

757
00:53:43,895 --> 00:53:45,159
Speaker 1: I'm looking at Amazon right now.

758
00:53:45,219 --> 00:53:45,520
Speaker 0: liquid.

759
00:53:45,621 --> 00:53:46,949
Speaker 1: I bought a pack of other people.

760
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:48,580
Speaker 0: I got a pack of quadruple-a batteries.

761
00:53:49,001 --> 00:53:54,067
Speaker 1: I got some paper towels some toilet paper cliff bar cliff energy shots the gels.

762
00:53:54,708 --> 00:53:56,430
Speaker 1: I keep just buying those over and over again.

763
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,437
Speaker 0: Lots of cleaning equipment on here.

764
00:53:59,457 --> 00:54:02,608
Speaker 0: Yeah for some reason replacements for stuff that broke I see here.

765
00:54:03,471 --> 00:54:06,522
Speaker 1: Oh, I can tell there's the day when I must have been sick.

766
00:54:06,562 --> 00:54:17,810
Speaker 1: all my old socks because I remember I did a sock purge And I got rid of all my bullshit old broken socks and I bought like 10 pair of the exact same smart Wool running sock to use forever like I bought all these socks all at once.

767
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:22,336
Speaker 0: You know and also being a nerd right, you know We're at least the kind of nerd.

768
00:54:22,356 --> 00:54:25,069
Speaker 0: we are where your computer is such an important thing in your life.

769
00:54:25,652 --> 00:54:29,809
Speaker 0: Right and like building the new computer is like a big event like every five six years or so.

770
00:54:30,051 --> 00:54:31,909
Speaker 0: All right used to be more frequent.

771
00:54:31,929 --> 00:54:32,797
Speaker 0: now It's less frequent.

772
00:54:33,201 --> 00:54:34,050
Speaker 0: you go back to new way.

773
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:36,498
Speaker 0: You can see exactly which computers you got when.

774
00:54:36,518 --> 00:54:37,281
Speaker 0: right.

775
00:54:37,461 --> 00:54:41,656
Speaker 0: because I'm starting to like there was a point at which I was like This is my first computer.

776
00:54:42,258 --> 00:54:48,338
Speaker 0: This is my second computer up right and then eventually it's like Which computer is this six?

777
00:54:48,398 --> 00:54:49,361
Speaker 0: I don't even know anymore.

778
00:54:49,421 --> 00:54:50,084
Speaker 1: There was a computer.

779
00:54:50,144 --> 00:54:51,750
Speaker 1: I was thinking back and there was a computer.

780
00:54:52,112 --> 00:54:53,781
Speaker 1: I forgot about that.

781
00:54:53,882 --> 00:55:01,042
Speaker 1: I built around 2006 used for several years and forgot right up because that computer was not.

782
00:55:01,082 --> 00:55:03,388
Speaker 1: it was an 8-bit motherboard and it was not stable.

783
00:55:03,408 --> 00:55:05,238
Speaker 1: I Remember that computer.

784
00:55:05,864 --> 00:55:06,973
Speaker 1: I remember the day I built it in.

785
00:55:06,993 --> 00:55:09,430
Speaker 1: the power supply didn't work and I was a pissy mood all day.

786
00:55:09,913 --> 00:55:16,541
Speaker 1: all these memories came back from November of 2006 when I built this computer with a bullshitty motherboard.

787
00:55:16,561 --> 00:55:32,370
Speaker 1: because honestly 2006 bad year to buy a computer That was like the height of Athlons not being stable but good Intel's were not cheap yet Yep, but yeah It's like I go back and I can see exactly which computers I got when computers I built for other people.

788
00:55:32,793 --> 00:55:34,044
Speaker 0: HTP sees also.

789
00:55:34,065 --> 00:55:37,117
Speaker 0: Yeah You know all that's and it's like I can.

790
00:55:37,157 --> 00:55:43,420
Speaker 0: really I can even track my own even though that's less of a privacy concern like Someone else who sees that won't be able to learn much from it, right?

791
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:48,290
Speaker 0: They'll just say oh, it's got bought computers every five years For every four or five six years.

792
00:55:48,771 --> 00:55:54,846
Speaker 0: But I can look at that and just because of my memory plus the order history, right?

793
00:55:55,187 --> 00:55:59,259
Speaker 0: I can get a better Reminder of my entire life, right?

794
00:55:59,299 --> 00:56:02,610
Speaker 0: Yeah where I was what I was doing what life was like literally.

795
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:05,742
Speaker 0: I'm looking at that order history seeing a bit only a bit.

796
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:13,810
Speaker 1: a b9 Pro Just brought back a flood of memories from that year that I would never have access to get otherwise.

797
00:56:14,943 --> 00:56:26,109
Speaker 1: Yep Also every computer I bought it's funny I noticed something looking at all the computers I bought because I now I have I'm in front of me Literally every computer I've ever bought.

798
00:56:27,031 --> 00:56:34,030
Speaker 1: Every one of them has a bunch of external like five and a half inch drives doing shit.

799
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:45,589
Speaker 1: They all have a DVD player They all have except for the first one because DVD players too expensive back then and like a CD burner and then that just stops Like my new computer doesn't even have an external port.

800
00:56:47,113 --> 00:56:49,429
Speaker 0: The other thing is that you can try to do the opposite, right?

801
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:55,431
Speaker 0: Think about a life event you had that was so significant that you don't you wouldn't forget it ever Mm-hmm.

802
00:56:55,933 --> 00:57:00,129
Speaker 0: and then go and look and find your order histories or just check your email for order.

803
00:57:00,571 --> 00:57:18,490
Speaker 0: You know if you don't want to go to like any particular website for like, you know Your your email at the time or your order histories at the time Right and you'll learn about like oh this is you know, you'll sort of put pieces together like oh I bought this stuff and did these things and that was like the same week as this other light.

804
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:21,423
Speaker 0: You know this vacation I went on that I could never forget right?

805
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:25,218
Speaker 0: It's like, oh look, there's the stuff I bought before the vacation right.

806
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,189
Speaker 0: and then here's the stuff I bought when I got home, right?

807
00:57:28,911 --> 00:57:30,135
Speaker 0: You know, it totally makes sense.

808
00:57:30,175 --> 00:57:30,356
Speaker 0: Yeah.

809
00:57:30,416 --> 00:57:33,408
Speaker 0: Oh look I bought a new luggage then I left right then I came back.

810
00:57:33,468 --> 00:57:37,636
Speaker 0: then I bought Oh, I don't know some sun lotion.

811
00:57:37,696 --> 00:57:38,759
Speaker 0: cuz I burnt myself higher.

812
00:57:39,241 --> 00:57:43,154
Speaker 0: I remember I don't know that's not something in my list That's just something I thought of.

813
00:57:43,194 --> 00:57:46,209
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm just skimming through here like randomly looking at stuff.

814
00:57:46,269 --> 00:57:49,781
Speaker 1: cuz There are some things like cell phones are not here.

815
00:57:49,901 --> 00:57:52,110
Speaker 1: cuz until recently you didn't buy cell phones online.

816
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:55,529
Speaker 1: You went to like a cell provider store and bought a cell phone.

817
00:57:56,373 --> 00:58:02,702
Speaker 0: Every cell phone I bought is either from a cell store Either from a phone store or from an Apple store.

818
00:58:02,742 --> 00:58:04,770
Speaker 1: I remember going to the mall to buy my first cell phone.

819
00:58:07,053 --> 00:58:08,728
Speaker 0: My first cell phone is given to me.

820
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:12,850
Speaker 1: Yeah Because you had the cell phone at RIT before we did when I was co-oping at IBM.

821
00:58:13,051 --> 00:58:17,690
Speaker 1: I went to the mall and I bought a Sprint phone because that was the only phone I could afford.

822
00:58:18,456 --> 00:58:20,489
Speaker 0: Yep anyway.

823
00:58:21,611 --> 00:58:24,562
Speaker 1: So, uh, there's no moral to this show other than that.

824
00:58:25,164 --> 00:58:37,809
Speaker 1: It was surprising to us Looking back at this history how interesting it was to see like this track of data about us Parallel with the memories we have our lives up to this point.

825
00:58:39,071 --> 00:58:45,190
Speaker 0: It's also I guess one other thing is it's interesting to see if your preferences changed over your life, right?

826
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:48,243
Speaker 0: Yeah, like it's like oh I was I was.

827
00:58:48,444 --> 00:58:49,730
Speaker 0: they know they haven't really at all.

828
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:49,911
Speaker 0: I was.

829
00:58:49,992 --> 00:58:54,000
Speaker 0: I've been buying the same like laundry detergent for yep I noticed the most.

830
00:58:54,604 --> 00:59:04,296
Speaker 1: every technology thing I'm looking at here is either the cheapest bootleggiest piece of shit or the most expensive option and there's nothing in the middle Anything I've ever bought.

831
00:59:04,316 --> 00:59:06,243
Speaker 1: I've never bought a middle-of-the-road thing.

832
00:59:06,263 --> 00:59:08,210
Speaker 1: I either go big or I buy garbage.

833
00:59:08,732 --> 00:59:11,645
Speaker 0: I can see book club books that I've bought for the podcast in here.

834
00:59:11,665 --> 00:59:16,690
Speaker 1: Yeah And this is like it's just fascinating.

835
00:59:17,853 --> 00:59:19,930
Speaker 0: So yeah, everyone go check out your order histories.

836
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:22,339
Speaker 0: Hope that no one ever leaks them to the world.

837
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:32,230
Speaker 1: like say let's go go search your email for like Invoice and go to the oldest email go to Amazon just go to the oldest thing and just you might be surprised.

838
00:59:32,503 --> 00:59:39,709
Speaker 0: Yeah type in things like invoice or order and then go to the end literally the end of your email like the earliest possible time.

839
00:59:39,729 --> 00:59:42,226
Speaker 0: I Paid $200 for that piece of shit.

840
00:59:43,493 --> 00:59:50,970
Speaker 1: Okay, okay in 2013. like I was saying LED panels weren't good Until recently and they were expensive.

841
00:59:51,652 --> 00:59:53,277
Speaker 1: I spent $200 in 2013 for an LED panel that I still have.

842
00:59:53,337 --> 01:00:00,436
Speaker 1: that is like the most dangerous Poorly soldered piece of shit.

843
01:00:00,999 --> 01:00:02,464
Speaker 1: I should probably just throw this thing away.

844
01:00:02,484 --> 01:00:03,087
Speaker 1: I still have it.

845
01:00:03,368 --> 01:00:03,890
Speaker 1: I don't use it.
