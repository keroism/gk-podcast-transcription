1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,258
Speaker 0: It's Monday June 13th 2016.

2
00:00:12,258 --> 00:00:17,250
Speaker 0: I'm rim I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight talking to your computer.

3
00:00:19,211 --> 00:00:20,227
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:31,938
Speaker 1: So you know there are certain things that like become like personal Traditions like something you do every year or something you know.

5
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:33,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got a few of those things.

6
00:00:33,669 --> 00:00:34,514
Speaker 1: you got a few of those things.

7
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,147
Speaker 1: like it's like your thing And you always do it.

8
00:00:36,248 --> 00:00:44,243
Speaker 0: like every year around Emily's birthday We go for some sort of like crazy hike or some sort of like outdoor adventure, okay, so For the past.

9
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:58,320
Speaker 1: I don't know how many years right either by chance or by intention I have gone to the Big Apple barbecue in Madison Square Park, but this year for so whatever reason It was this weekend, and I don't know about it until it was too late.

10
00:00:58,521 --> 00:00:59,854
Speaker 0: Oh, you don't regather missed enough.

11
00:00:59,874 --> 00:01:00,540
Speaker 0: you missed Christmas.

12
00:01:01,042 --> 00:01:05,640
Speaker 1: I read it and that's where I found out that it happened and they posted after it was already happening.

13
00:01:06,165 --> 00:01:07,335
Speaker 1: Where were you during the week?

14
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:07,759
Speaker 0: I?

15
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:16,078
Speaker 1: Skipped it every year, but only because unless you get there early in the day That's what I used did I would bike there at the crack of dawn and eat like ribs and beans like 10 or 11 a.m.

16
00:01:17,221 --> 00:01:21,099
Speaker 1: And like that there's one dude's beans have become like maybe my favorite food.

17
00:01:22,202 --> 00:01:24,910
Speaker 0: I mean, it's that's the desert island food.

18
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:30,740
Speaker 1: It's a tough run between that and like salt and fat You know.

19
00:01:32,883 --> 00:01:36,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, so they have the menus all different now, but that it's always all different.

20
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, that scallop is there of course is there and I thought I'd go back to ice cream.

21
00:01:40,802 --> 00:01:42,916
Speaker 0: Uh the ice cream is not going yet next month.

22
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:43,580
Speaker 0: the ice cream is back.

23
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,626
Speaker 1: I'm going next month then.

24
00:01:44,746 --> 00:01:46,938
Speaker 0: but instead they I got that panna cotta that I never get.

25
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:47,761
Speaker 0: no I don't know.

26
00:01:47,781 --> 00:01:49,366
Speaker 0: so you know what's under that panna cotta?

27
00:01:49,947 --> 00:01:54,119
Speaker 0: like a half-inch thick sponge cake made primarily with olive oil.

28
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:56,407
Speaker 1: Okay, holy shit.

29
00:01:57,029 --> 00:01:59,098
Speaker 0: was that probably really bad for me?

30
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,800
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I totally missed it, but the guy who owns the John Brown place is oh that place is the one that's right here.

31
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:13,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's open a new place in Astoria, so I mean that place is crazy good food especially cornbread.

32
00:02:13,581 --> 00:02:17,305
Speaker 1: Oh my so that doesn't run out of food or have bad Here's here.

33
00:02:17,325 --> 00:02:20,058
Speaker 0: There's two problems in my life right now related to that place.

34
00:02:20,339 --> 00:02:22,599
Speaker 0: one It's right next to the climbing gym that we go to.

35
00:02:24,188 --> 00:02:26,500
Speaker 0: If I walk out of the climbing gym, it's real tempting.

36
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:27,363
Speaker 0: So think about this.

37
00:02:27,403 --> 00:02:34,420
Speaker 0: you're exercising for like an hour like climbing up while you're hungry, and then you smell Barbecue fucking good barbecue like legit.

38
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:36,540
Speaker 1: I would just get a cornbread only if I want to hurt.

39
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,040
Speaker 1: You know, I can't eat barbecue that often no matter how much our body wants to also.

40
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:46,628
Speaker 0: But there's a far more insidious problem.

41
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:51,886
Speaker 0: when I bike to work my path goes past that place really Wouldn't you?

42
00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:52,047
Speaker 1: just?

43
00:02:52,268 --> 00:02:55,124
Speaker 1: I mean it's going down that street You're not just it shouldn't?

44
00:02:55,144 --> 00:02:56,792
Speaker 1: it usually would be just off to the left.

45
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:58,480
Speaker 0: no so the going down Vernon.

46
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:06,000
Speaker 0: The fastest way to get to the Pulaski is to go and then turn right on that Street I think it's 44th and then get on Vernon.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,163
Speaker 0: Yeah And then turn left.

48
00:03:07,544 --> 00:03:11,420
Speaker 1: I would turn right and go alongside the bridge get on Vernon then turn left.

49
00:03:11,722 --> 00:03:15,120
Speaker 0: So there's a shorter way if you just go under the seven train the whole way.

50
00:03:15,582 --> 00:03:20,120
Speaker 0: But there isn't bike lane through a chunk of that and that is like the most agro driver place in Queens.

51
00:03:20,221 --> 00:03:25,807
Speaker 1: I mean if I was going from here what I would do is I would just cut through that Not a road next to the project.

52
00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:27,334
Speaker 0: No, that's too far out of the way.

53
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:28,880
Speaker 1: That's when they go south on Vernon.

54
00:03:29,161 --> 00:03:31,227
Speaker 0: No, you're better off doing the ant.

55
00:03:31,448 --> 00:03:35,200
Speaker 0: cuz if you go that and that bike path goes straight into the Pulaski.

56
00:03:35,521 --> 00:03:38,333
Speaker 0: Otherwise you've gone out of your way cuz you're coming back from that road later.

57
00:03:38,354 --> 00:03:39,820
Speaker 1: I'm going right and then I'm going south.

58
00:03:39,901 --> 00:03:40,830
Speaker 1: It's not like I'm going north.

59
00:03:40,992 --> 00:03:44,807
Speaker 0: it adds Not insignificant distance whatever.

60
00:03:45,048 --> 00:03:48,660
Speaker 0: I mean I track my rides pretty closely like I know the absolute fastest possible.

61
00:03:48,983 --> 00:03:51,140
Speaker 1: I'm also not in a big hurry to go to work.

62
00:03:51,601 --> 00:03:54,068
Speaker 0: The problem is a real barbecue place.

63
00:03:54,388 --> 00:03:56,995
Speaker 0: They start making the barbecue early in the morning.

64
00:03:57,015 --> 00:03:58,058
Speaker 1: Yeah, it takes all fucking day.

65
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:00,828
Speaker 1: So The smell is why they run out of food.

66
00:04:00,868 --> 00:04:06,969
Speaker 0: because they didn't put enough in in the morning is perhaps peaking Just as I would buy pest it every morning.

67
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:13,233
Speaker 0: the smell of barbecue on that street is so powerful That I'll be thinking about it all day.

68
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:13,675
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

69
00:04:13,756 --> 00:04:14,680
Speaker 1: That's why they run out of food.

70
00:04:14,901 --> 00:04:15,503
Speaker 0: Yes, you know what I did.

71
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:18,134
Speaker 0: instead and instead of doing the barbecue thing I just like ran 11 miles.

72
00:04:18,154 --> 00:04:22,800
Speaker 1: Hey, hey You want to go eat there right after we're done with this show?

73
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:25,631
Speaker 1: Actually, I have three blue aprons and I've cooked.

74
00:04:25,711 --> 00:04:27,560
Speaker 1: I got them on Saturday and I've cooked zero of them.

75
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,535
Speaker 0: Oh, no, we have a blue apron I think coming today.

76
00:04:30,595 --> 00:04:31,560
Speaker 0: So we should probably cook that.

77
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,655
Speaker 0: Yeah, if it doesn't come to we always have a rule.

78
00:04:33,695 --> 00:04:33,997
Speaker 0: we always.

79
00:04:34,219 --> 00:04:36,800
Speaker 0: you know It's like Matt Cawthon in a Wheel of Time leave it up to chance.

80
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:42,659
Speaker 0: We'll say things like if the blue apron arrives by the time we're ready to eat then we'll cook it.

81
00:04:43,104 --> 00:04:46,149
Speaker 0: But if it doesn't That's okay.

82
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:46,879
Speaker 1: The weather was good.

83
00:04:47,483 --> 00:04:51,320
Speaker 1: I went to the park went to a big shop a lot of stuff going on in the city lately actually.

84
00:04:51,381 --> 00:04:52,260
Speaker 0: So I kind of lost track.

85
00:04:52,441 --> 00:04:56,560
Speaker 0: There's several events that I saw and thought I should go to that and then I went to some other event.

86
00:04:56,741 --> 00:05:00,252
Speaker 1: I actually actually worked on a shit talk project a lot of Saturday.

87
00:05:00,814 --> 00:05:01,637
Speaker 0: I worked on one too.

88
00:05:01,657 --> 00:05:07,660
Speaker 0: All right I remember how I said I'm gonna make those that chicken surprise shirt and all the fast food franchise themed t-shirts.

89
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,865
Speaker 1: Yeah, you worked on that.

90
00:05:09,045 --> 00:05:16,331
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the problem is there are Zero high-resolution scans of the actual art.

91
00:05:16,552 --> 00:05:17,033
Speaker 1: Well, we have.

92
00:05:17,134 --> 00:05:18,056
Speaker 1: you were in a game.

93
00:05:18,096 --> 00:05:19,280
Speaker 1: we can just do it ourselves.

94
00:05:19,764 --> 00:05:20,733
Speaker 0: It's very hard to get the game.

95
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:22,343
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna base I've got has it.

96
00:05:22,384 --> 00:05:25,175
Speaker 0: so I'm going to see if Chris will get a will scan.

97
00:05:25,476 --> 00:05:26,480
Speaker 0: if he doesn't I want a scanner.

98
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:31,537
Speaker 0: I'll just buy him one because they're like $10 and I have actually a way good scanner.

99
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,243
Speaker 1: now because It can.

100
00:05:33,384 --> 00:05:34,930
Speaker 1: I needed one that could scan film negative.

101
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,720
Speaker 0: We have a good scanner, but it's for like big art.

102
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,413
Speaker 0: It's not for like little tiny film things.

103
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,247
Speaker 1: I only use it for films but it can also scan.

104
00:05:43,287 --> 00:05:51,740
Speaker 0: it can also scan paper because a big old flatbed thing, but That I looked at some tentative designs for how the shirt would look and it looks real good.

105
00:05:52,461 --> 00:05:54,267
Speaker 0: So this is definitely gonna happen.

106
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:57,680
Speaker 0: I'm gonna make a few just so I can buy them myself.

107
00:05:58,063 --> 00:05:59,820
Speaker 1: Hope the guy who made the game doesn't come after you.

108
00:05:59,903 --> 00:06:06,811
Speaker 0: Well, no So you can make a shirt and not make it public so I could just buy it for myself Like miss print a high-quality t-shirt on demand.

109
00:06:07,032 --> 00:06:09,381
Speaker 0: Okay, I can make a lot of shirts Like.

110
00:06:09,401 --> 00:06:12,440
Speaker 0: I still know how I got this account because it looks like it's still invite only from Amazon.

111
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:20,782
Speaker 0: But if the shirts look good I'm gonna make one for me and I might give one to like Chris or Anthony just as a gift because I feel like that's Appropriate.

112
00:06:21,505 --> 00:06:27,813
Speaker 0: and then the next step is I'm actually gonna try to reach out to the guy and be like look Can I have a licensing agreement to just make these shirts?

113
00:06:28,235 --> 00:06:29,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll sell them on Amazon.

114
00:06:29,501 --> 00:06:31,913
Speaker 1: I'll give you like half the money Amazon gives me.

115
00:06:32,033 --> 00:06:32,275
Speaker 1: Okay.

116
00:06:32,295 --> 00:06:33,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, what do I give a shit?

117
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,040
Speaker 1: I'll give you all the money Amazon gives me or I'll even be like, you know what?

118
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:43,580
Speaker 1: I'll sell them at the value where no money comes out and these shirts just exist or I'll charge him at the price you want Them to be charged and give you all the money.

119
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:43,761
Speaker 1: I don't.

120
00:06:43,781 --> 00:06:47,283
Speaker 0: yeah, cuz I just really like that Terrible like.

121
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:52,376
Speaker 0: there's something about the chicken surprise logo on a bright orange t-shirt that just it just did.

122
00:06:52,757 --> 00:06:54,000
Speaker 0: it warms the cockles of my heart.

123
00:06:54,101 --> 00:06:55,559
Speaker 0: Do you got any news?

124
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,908
Speaker 0: So I know this is a loaded question.

125
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:04,365
Speaker 1: Yeah, so six minutes before we did the show Dateline 6 p.m.

126
00:07:04,365 --> 00:07:04,987
Speaker 0: 605 p.m.

127
00:07:05,047 --> 00:07:05,228
Speaker 0: Right?

128
00:07:05,248 --> 00:07:07,535
Speaker 1: So we were already thinking earlier in the day man.

129
00:07:07,555 --> 00:07:09,420
Speaker 1: What an easy news for Monday tech show.

130
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,104
Speaker 1: It's Apple Day.

131
00:07:10,225 --> 00:07:12,940
Speaker 1: Thank you Apple for finally having your day on our Monday.

132
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:20,340
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm sure it's happened before but usually it feels like Apple Day is always like the week before We do a Monday show or two weeks.

133
00:07:21,403 --> 00:07:29,048
Speaker 1: We'll do a show on Monday and then Apple Day will be Wednesday and we won't come around again till the week and a half At least once to like we're.

134
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:31,740
Speaker 0: someone was out of town and we like couldn't do the show for a few weeks.

135
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:38,315
Speaker 1: There have definitely been cases though where Apple Day was on you guys day But today is one of those days again, and I thought oh what an easy day.

136
00:07:38,355 --> 00:07:39,480
Speaker 1: all this Apple news, right?

137
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,834
Speaker 1: But no six minutes before we did the show an even bigger news appeared.

138
00:07:45,295 --> 00:07:51,100
Speaker 1: that is not tech related, but doesn't matter It's too big to ignore and thankfully it happened before the show and not during the show.

139
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:57,110
Speaker 1: So we didn't ruin our show like stopping in the middle when someone was reading the internet and saw this news Which we probably would have like.

140
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,620
Speaker 0: there's very little breaking news.

141
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,473
Speaker 0: That is actually breaking news as far as geek nights is concerned.

142
00:08:01,573 --> 00:08:03,928
Speaker 1: I was like this news is so big I had to be like rim.

143
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:04,655
Speaker 1: you guys sit down.

144
00:08:04,736 --> 00:08:08,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm like Like it's really it's too big and I'm like this is too big.

145
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,375
Speaker 0: did copyright get reformed.

146
00:08:10,496 --> 00:08:17,146
Speaker 1: No, it's not that big Not that big But this news is ginormous.

147
00:08:17,186 --> 00:08:20,600
Speaker 1: You probably know it already unless I mean by the time you're listening to this, right?

148
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,565
Speaker 1: It's been hours already.

149
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:22,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if you know who we are.

150
00:08:22,571 --> 00:08:24,280
Speaker 0: you can guess what we're about to talk about.

151
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,537
Speaker 1: So one of the most important people right the president, I don't know is he a CEO?

152
00:08:29,597 --> 00:08:30,600
Speaker 1: was was CEO.

153
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:31,406
Speaker 1: I could look.

154
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:33,159
Speaker 1: I guess I gave up the whole news already.

155
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:34,662
Speaker 0: I'm gonna.

156
00:08:34,683 --> 00:08:37,294
Speaker 0: I'm gonna look up his LinkedIn profile and actual title was cuz.

157
00:08:37,313 --> 00:08:38,520
Speaker 0: I didn't even Robert.

158
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,943
Speaker 1: I do not know his middle name.

159
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:41,910
Speaker 1: He might not even have one coup.

160
00:08:42,191 --> 00:08:49,833
Speaker 1: My grandpa doesn't have a middle name has officially resigned as The person who was in charge of penny arcade.

161
00:08:49,893 --> 00:08:58,440
Speaker 1: He was the president Sure One of the most important people who makes the shit happen that we care about.

162
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:07,466
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, he's used the Walt still is but he is still for until I guess mid-july the president of operations And business development.

163
00:09:07,907 --> 00:09:09,052
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm for penny arcade Inc.

164
00:09:09,353 --> 00:09:11,926
Speaker 0: and the managing director of Child's Play.

165
00:09:11,946 --> 00:09:12,612
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

166
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:13,257
Speaker 0: I was.

167
00:09:13,358 --> 00:09:16,860
Speaker 0: I Wonder if he will continue to run Child's Play.

168
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:19,480
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure he's resigned from everything who's going to the beach.

169
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,713
Speaker 0: But I think that the thing specifically said leaving penny arcade, I don't know it didn't.

170
00:09:23,773 --> 00:09:24,796
Speaker 1: I mean it wasn't detailed.

171
00:09:24,816 --> 00:09:30,000
Speaker 0: right to be honest I know a lot of people who are managing directors of charities, which means they literally do nothing.

172
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:32,338
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you have your name on it, right?

173
00:09:33,582 --> 00:09:34,959
Speaker 1: So what does this mean?

174
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,691
Speaker 0: It's and again, we're not going to speculate on any weird stuff.

175
00:09:39,711 --> 00:09:40,694
Speaker 1: We don't have any information.

176
00:09:40,734 --> 00:09:41,938
Speaker 1: You don't have really.

177
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:45,412
Speaker 0: yeah Even if we did if we had information you didn't have.

178
00:09:45,473 --> 00:09:46,880
Speaker 0: it's probably something we shouldn't share.

179
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:55,699
Speaker 1: People who paid money to be in Club PA which we're not in I think they got a Newsletter from him this morning or something and they know more than we do because we're not paying for that shit.

180
00:09:56,001 --> 00:09:58,259
Speaker 1: Yep, and no one shared that online yet.

181
00:09:58,982 --> 00:10:06,107
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it looks like the the official pack site thing just says that in July 15th He's going to step down up.

182
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,294
Speaker 0: Yep from penny arcade and Child's Play.

183
00:10:08,394 --> 00:10:10,808
Speaker 0: Okay, and That's all we know.

184
00:10:11,537 --> 00:10:16,325
Speaker 0: So Generally when this sort of thing happens just in general You know crap.

185
00:10:16,345 --> 00:10:17,289
Speaker 0: Oh basic business.

186
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:18,413
Speaker 0: There was a drama.

187
00:10:18,695 --> 00:10:25,994
Speaker 1: There's either some sort of internal drama Reason like we're not doing so well lately out with the CEO.

188
00:10:26,355 --> 00:10:27,319
Speaker 1: Let's put a new one in.

189
00:10:27,983 --> 00:10:32,006
Speaker 0: I don't suspect the latter is what happened here And I don't even really suspect the farmers.

190
00:10:32,046 --> 00:10:32,728
Speaker 0: what happened here?

191
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:38,640
Speaker 0: because penny arcade is a pretty just as an outside observer I mean, you never can know unless you're part of one of these things.

192
00:10:39,367 --> 00:10:44,660
Speaker 0: It looks pretty tight Like I feel like there's enough family feeling and intimacy to where it was.

193
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,734
Speaker 1: I mean, it seems like their growth phase has and oh you mean drama.

194
00:10:47,975 --> 00:10:48,115
Speaker 1: Yeah.

195
00:10:48,156 --> 00:10:58,009
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think that was drama But it seems like their growth phase has ended and there's sort of been really like in this status quo of hovering and instability For a quite a while

196
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,364
Speaker 0: which is you know, when you look at it They were like a few

197
00:11:00,404 --> 00:11:01,048
Speaker 1: years at least.

198
00:11:01,108 --> 00:11:03,180
Speaker 1: how they pack south is already going into a third year.

199
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,626
Speaker 1: So they're like for the past two or three years.

200
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,940
Speaker 1: They just been sort of doing the same thing not really doing it.

201
00:11:08,181 --> 00:11:21,799
Speaker 0: They hit this sort of like peak momentum where they started expanding paxes rapidly and not just taxes But like their other endeavors like they tried the strip search and they tried You know, I really like strip search, but I don't think that can make enough money.

202
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:34,479
Speaker 0: They're printing, you know, all kinds of tabletop games and they're you know, and while I love the idea of making tabletop games like that I don't think most of those games were that good or at least they weren't gonna be profitable enough.

203
00:11:34,841 --> 00:11:35,405
Speaker 1: They made all.

204
00:11:35,425 --> 00:11:39,927
Speaker 0: those are video games RPG ones.

205
00:11:40,048 --> 00:11:40,571
Speaker 0: I own them all.

206
00:11:40,591 --> 00:11:41,497
Speaker 0: I don't think I ever really played.

207
00:11:41,517 --> 00:11:41,880
Speaker 0: them played.

208
00:11:42,061 --> 00:11:43,888
Speaker 1: I beat the first one it even played the second one,

209
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:59,948
Speaker 0: but the in terms of paxes it's interesting because the two main paxes West and East and we'll get back to the fact that it's called West now because it's interesting that they pointedly changed the name to West Kind of ahead of all this.

210
00:11:59,968 --> 00:12:02,760
Speaker 0: So I wonder if that was in a little planning phase.

211
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,287
Speaker 1: I don't think that has anything to do with them resigning No, but well it could in the sense of like.

212
00:12:07,307 --> 00:12:11,858
Speaker 0: they're trying to align paxes to be their own thing and sort of consolidate I don't think.

213
00:12:13,744 --> 00:12:17,779
Speaker 0: Well, we'll see because they've definitely been trying to get more people to go to the other paxes.

214
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,529
Speaker 0: But that's for sure as the world is shown.

215
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,455
Speaker 0: No, everyone wants to go to Pax Prime.

216
00:12:22,495 --> 00:12:23,780
Speaker 0: All the other paxes are second-tier.

217
00:12:24,021 --> 00:12:28,814
Speaker 1: Yeah, imagine if there was like San Diego Comic Con and there was another San Diego Comic Con.

218
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:29,696
Speaker 1: It's like no one.

219
00:12:30,057 --> 00:12:36,400
Speaker 0: the Milwaukee Comic Con That's the same people and like 80% the same contact content, but it's in Milwaukee.

220
00:12:36,962 --> 00:12:38,267
Speaker 0: Like would you go to Milwaukee?

221
00:12:38,488 --> 00:12:41,880
Speaker 1: Apparently there was room for New York Comic Con, but there's room for East and West packs.

222
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:48,360
Speaker 1: Yeah I don't think there's room for more than two things in the u.s Cuz all you can do is hit the population center on the West and hit the population center on the East.

223
00:12:48,486 --> 00:12:56,906
Speaker 0: Yeah Because based on the data that I've been able to get access to over the years my suspicion was sort of you too in Chicago Never got big packs.

224
00:12:57,147 --> 00:12:57,468
Speaker 0: prop.

225
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:07,179
Speaker 0: ex-west seems to have mostly people who are local Or people who have money and just fly to it because it's the big packs and the whole game industry is there.

226
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:13,100
Speaker 0: Pax East seems to be mostly either game industry, especially East Coast game industry.

227
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:19,277
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you know, there's 50 to 70 million people within a short drive of Boston.

228
00:13:19,337 --> 00:13:20,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, so

229
00:13:21,062 --> 00:13:27,224
Speaker 0: everyone on the East Coast goes to that one or at least tries to because even if you can't afford to fly out west like That's within spitting distance

230
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:33,444
Speaker 1: pack south is like hardly any industry or the the mid-tier and lower industry who can't you know Like

231
00:13:33,749 --> 00:13:35,964
Speaker 0: I'll put it this way This is this is the shocking truth.

232
00:13:36,165 --> 00:13:42,183
Speaker 0: and locals if you die hards if you list it in order of like how much actual impact They have in the industry.

233
00:13:42,203 --> 00:13:50,651
Speaker 0: everyone in the games industry or adjacent to it who goes to pack south in an official capacity We're in we're not in the bottom tenth of that list.

234
00:13:50,671 --> 00:13:51,775
Speaker 0: We're in like the bottom ninth.

235
00:13:51,996 --> 00:13:57,698
Speaker 0: Yeah, like Like We're at the bottom of the list as opposed to not being on the list, right?

236
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:06,043
Speaker 0: But pack south is almost all locals like from Texas like not even from nearby states But like.

237
00:14:06,364 --> 00:14:09,759
Speaker 0: they live in or near San Antonio and drive there for the day.

238
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:18,000
Speaker 0: Like and tax us is pretty much just people in Asia Pacific and crazy people like us who fly mostly Australians.

239
00:14:18,181 --> 00:14:22,800
Speaker 1: I didn't see you know, how many like Chinese Japanese Philippines.

240
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:30,969
Speaker 0: I get the impression Just because I've been to I went to a. no I went to the next pack, you know the two packs ausses ago after when Scott didn't.

241
00:14:30,989 --> 00:14:41,050
Speaker 0: you don't see a lot of Antarctic ins there and what you what I saw Was that the I suspect the demographic of people from Asia Pacific who go to packs Australia who are not from Australia?

242
00:14:42,242 --> 00:14:46,540
Speaker 0: Is very close to the demographic of people from Asia Pacific who go to packs prime?

243
00:14:47,742 --> 00:14:55,520
Speaker 0: That is my guess Based on the audience's based on interactions and even people from Western Australia don't go to the Eastern Australian bags.

244
00:14:55,741 --> 00:15:02,475
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is so big like it's Melbourne Sydney Brisbane get like that East Coast District and that seems to be the majority.

245
00:15:02,595 --> 00:15:09,239
Speaker 0: Yeah, so packs is can't expand in terms of more packs is unless those packs is like.

246
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:20,574
Speaker 0: I Hate to say this, but if there were two packs is in Seattle and two packs is in Boston They'd probably bolt they'd probably all four sell out way more than packs south does.

247
00:15:20,755 --> 00:15:22,540
Speaker 0: maybe that's my guess anyway.

248
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:23,709
Speaker 1: But yeah, Robert cool.

249
00:15:23,729 --> 00:15:24,555
Speaker 1: What's gonna happen to packs?

250
00:15:24,576 --> 00:15:24,878
Speaker 1: I don't know.

251
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:39,814
Speaker 0: Yeah, because not for nothing but even at even as recently as the packs east we just went to like some shit went down like we're like with the Boston police nonsense where they were like scat like checking people's bags and crab like it was kind of a clusterfuck.

252
00:15:40,436 --> 00:15:51,270
Speaker 0: and then we saw Physically Robert Coo walked over there and was looking at it and sort of like frowning and Then a tweet came out that was like we're dealing with this.

253
00:15:51,631 --> 00:15:55,574
Speaker 1: and then it was dealt with and it was from his Twitter account not the penny arcade Twitter account.

254
00:15:55,897 --> 00:15:55,978
Speaker 0: and

255
00:15:56,654 --> 00:16:09,579
Speaker 1: also there was the time there was a hotel block and some packs people couldn't get in their hotel rooms and Because the Oakland Raiders came to town and the hotel gave the rooms to them instead and then Robert Coo Personally went to the hotel and fought with them and got the Oakland Raiders kicked out of the hotel.

256
00:16:10,283 --> 00:16:13,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's like sure even if it's somebody else's job to do that.

257
00:16:13,661 --> 00:16:16,680
Speaker 1: Do you think that they will succeed where Robert Coo succeeded?

258
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:24,759
Speaker 1: I think that another person or any most human beings I can think of like if Mike or Jerry had to go talk to the Hotel, they're not gonna make it happen.

259
00:16:25,241 --> 00:16:29,095
Speaker 1: Right, who do you know in the penny arcade organization that could go to the hotel and make that happen?

260
00:16:29,115 --> 00:16:32,514
Speaker 0: because that sort of Conversation is it's there's.

261
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:33,380
Speaker 0: there's a lot of factors.

262
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:39,900
Speaker 0: There's the magic man factor or magic, you know The magic person the someone who just has that combination of gravitas and whatever which is pretty rare.

263
00:16:40,482 --> 00:16:50,340
Speaker 0: There's also the knows enough about the industry business contract law Whatever to be able to actually make the real argument that needs to be made like breach of contract or you know, whatever.

264
00:16:50,902 --> 00:16:52,046
Speaker 0: That's a skill like.

265
00:16:52,086 --> 00:16:53,471
Speaker 0: that's a real difficult thing to do.

266
00:16:53,532 --> 00:16:55,680
Speaker 0: If you don't know it's a skill and knowledge.

267
00:16:55,908 --> 00:16:56,119
Speaker 0: Yeah.

268
00:16:56,462 --> 00:17:04,652
Speaker 0: and then third and a personality you've also got to be someone who Understands like packs and like the culture of the convention and its needs.

269
00:17:04,913 --> 00:17:07,619
Speaker 0: there are very few people who have all of those attributes.

270
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:14,017
Speaker 0: So not like I have a lot of faith in packs because the enforcers do a lot of the like.

271
00:17:14,057 --> 00:17:16,724
Speaker 1: the things that make it Enforce your kid go fight with a hotel.

272
00:17:16,746 --> 00:17:33,859
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there is a tier of things above the top of the enforcers That are at the level of penny arcade staff that I I hope They find some combination of people who can fill this role effectively because I don't think there's one person who could know.

273
00:17:34,501 --> 00:17:36,166
Speaker 0: That's how much I respect Robert coup.

274
00:17:36,206 --> 00:17:36,747
Speaker 0: in all the years.

275
00:17:36,768 --> 00:17:40,820
Speaker 0: I have either interacted with him or just watched him interact with others.

276
00:17:41,842 --> 00:17:43,627
Speaker 0: So I guess Robert like we salute you.

277
00:17:43,828 --> 00:17:44,148
Speaker 0: Good luck.

278
00:17:44,168 --> 00:17:44,650
Speaker 0: Have fun.

279
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:53,773
Speaker 0: I hope you are taking a vacation and you enjoy it And we'll keep going to Pax's until they burn into fire.

280
00:17:53,793 --> 00:17:54,736
Speaker 0: I hope they don't.

281
00:17:54,836 --> 00:18:10,258
Speaker 0: I hope Pax's outlive me But they could burn it if I now if somehow I'm not saying this is gonna happen But if somehow Pax's decline I'll do everything I can just to get everyone I know and just start the equivalent spiritual successor.

282
00:18:10,278 --> 00:18:11,580
Speaker 0: Sure That's what I would do.

283
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,339
Speaker 0: That would be my life.

284
00:18:12,561 --> 00:18:19,559
Speaker 0: I would consider quitting a job and then borrowing money to try to make that happen But hopefully it'll not come to that geek night's Expo GNX.

285
00:18:21,997 --> 00:18:29,708
Speaker 0: I Might just go more generic than that Of course just gax Not even just nice arcade expo.

286
00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:31,553
Speaker 0: No just stuff that Nickelodeon.

287
00:18:31,814 --> 00:18:33,078
Speaker 0: It doesn't even stand for anything.

288
00:18:33,098 --> 00:18:33,660
Speaker 0: It's just gax.

289
00:18:35,242 --> 00:18:37,390
Speaker 0: So I guess in actual techno, right?

290
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,458
Speaker 1: So what it was Apple Day like we said before.

291
00:18:39,478 --> 00:18:40,565
Speaker 0: yep It took me.

292
00:18:40,766 --> 00:18:48,459
Speaker 1: this is the worldwide developers conference Which means the Apple only talks about stuff that developers care about not stuff like products that normal people would buy.

293
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:55,280
Speaker 0: it was Surprisingly hard to without several minutes of googling find a succinct list of the things that they announced.

294
00:18:55,324 --> 00:19:01,925
Speaker 1: well Cuz a tech news site wants to make a whole bunch of stories one for each item that Apple talked about to get you to Most ad impressions.

295
00:19:01,945 --> 00:19:03,431
Speaker 1: I'm clicking on all these separate articles.

296
00:19:03,592 --> 00:19:03,853
Speaker 1: Yep.

297
00:19:04,335 --> 00:19:05,640
Speaker 0: So I'm not super high level.

298
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,927
Speaker 0: They're really pushing Swift both as like.

299
00:19:07,967 --> 00:19:09,070
Speaker 0: well the super high level.

300
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:15,723
Speaker 1: they're talking about their four OS's right TV the Mac the iOS and The watch.

301
00:19:15,983 --> 00:19:19,635
Speaker 0: yep now there's no more OS X. there's gonna be what Sierra.

302
00:19:19,816 --> 00:19:20,337
Speaker 1: they called it.

303
00:19:20,438 --> 00:19:21,100
Speaker 1: No, it's Mac OS.

304
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:29,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, they changed it because they had iOS TV OS watch OS and now instead of OS X It's Mac OS which is what it was originally.

305
00:19:29,641 --> 00:19:35,157
Speaker 1: I think they really messed up with OS X because they went with the animal names right away and they kept.

306
00:19:35,177 --> 00:19:41,761
Speaker 1: you know in those Early 2000s they kept incrementing the animal and they never had the balls to just make it OS 11.

307
00:19:41,761 --> 00:19:45,112
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I think it's because they never really even even the one.

308
00:19:45,212 --> 00:19:58,640
Speaker 1: if you compare the newest one to the first OS X it still has that same fundamental design of The old Mac OS bar the top right that you know The the top level menus that you even have on like a Mac Plus which I have in my closet.

309
00:19:59,122 --> 00:20:04,040
Speaker 1: But what made it OS X was the taskbar at the bottom and you still have that exact same fucking taskbar at the bottom.

310
00:20:04,381 --> 00:20:10,720
Speaker 1: So it's like it's still OS X. It doesn't seem like it's worthy of an 11 right because they haven't revamped it completely.

311
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:21,020
Speaker 1: So it they just kept improving or well changing, you know The various apps and adding features in like notifications and spaces and all that, you know, I kind of stuff.

312
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:23,929
Speaker 1: So I guess that's the reason they never went to 11 with it.

313
00:20:24,772 --> 00:20:34,987
Speaker 1: So I guess now realizing that You know the you can't just keep incrementing the the you know place name while keeping OS X They wanted the symmetry.

314
00:20:35,268 --> 00:20:37,881
Speaker 1: so they went, you know watch OS iOS OS.

315
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:41,392
Speaker 0: I could cut the other thumb off for symmetry here.

316
00:20:41,432 --> 00:20:47,880
Speaker 1: if they wanted real symmetry symmetry iOS They announced iOS 10, but it's Mac OS Sierra.

317
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:51,331
Speaker 1: shouldn't iOS also have like names of things and not numbers?

318
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:54,662
Speaker 1: because you're gonna get like iOS 37 and then it's gonna be weird and It's gonna be.

319
00:20:54,844 --> 00:20:56,820
Speaker 1: you know, the marketing people aren't gonna like that.

320
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,520
Speaker 1: Well, that's for the same reason people don't like they didn't want to do Super Bowl L.

321
00:21:01,142 --> 00:21:05,219
Speaker 0: Is this going to get into the situation that video cards got into for a long time?

322
00:21:05,661 --> 00:21:17,060
Speaker 0: That I think radio and video cards still kind of have this problem like the ATI nonsense that processors have where Users unless they are paying attention don't really know what version of something they're running anymore.

323
00:21:17,827 --> 00:21:28,552
Speaker 1: I think they're gonna you know Either change Mac OS to have a number or they're gonna change all the other ones to have names and it'll be iOS name Watch OS name tv OS name.

324
00:21:28,672 --> 00:21:30,220
Speaker 1: Yeah Mac OS name.

325
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:33,600
Speaker 0: So they made a big deal about end-to-end encryption and all their privacy stuff.

326
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:37,920
Speaker 0: And if that whole session seemed to just be a big middle finger to the FBI which props?

327
00:21:38,261 --> 00:21:45,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, except they also gave the FBI like this huge Like olive branch, right?

328
00:21:45,841 --> 00:21:50,560
Speaker 1: While they were announcing all this shit about, you know privacy, which Apple does right?

329
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,739
Speaker 1: It's that's a legit thing and that they've always believed and they're just promoting that fact that they have that belief more than they used to.

330
00:21:57,603 --> 00:22:01,035
Speaker 1: They also made phones way easier to unlock.

331
00:22:01,055 --> 00:22:03,904
Speaker 1: They're like, hey everybody look Half the new features.

332
00:22:03,964 --> 00:22:08,159
Speaker 1: they like not half but a large number of the new features they announced especially in iOS.

333
00:22:08,179 --> 00:22:13,660
Speaker 1: We're like Check all this stuff that you can do without having to go through the pain in the ass of unlocking your phone.

334
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,112
Speaker 0: It's like really that's such a pain in the ass with my fingerprint sensor.

335
00:22:17,494 --> 00:22:21,411
Speaker 0: or Oh Android said that forever I can run like fucking almost any widget I want.

336
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,160
Speaker 1: but that's also a bad idea.

337
00:22:23,381 --> 00:22:27,260
Speaker 1: Oh, I'll just send a password reset email to Scott and then I got his phone.

338
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:28,304
Speaker 1: I can't unlock it.

339
00:22:28,344 --> 00:22:33,706
Speaker 1: But oh I can see the password reset email on the home screen screen And then I reset his email.

340
00:22:33,746 --> 00:22:38,445
Speaker 1: now, I got everything and then you know, they also announced a feature That was like a pretty quick thing.

341
00:22:38,465 --> 00:22:42,319
Speaker 1: They're like, oh you could unlock your Mac if you're wearing your iWatch.

342
00:22:42,399 --> 00:22:42,700
Speaker 1: Oh great.

343
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:46,475
Speaker 1: So now it's not something I know and it's not something I know and something I have.

344
00:22:46,555 --> 00:22:47,880
Speaker 1: it's the worst of all situations.

345
00:22:48,382 --> 00:22:53,100
Speaker 0: Well, it's not the worst which is the worst locked the worst by something I and other people also know.

346
00:22:53,421 --> 00:22:57,853
Speaker 1: Well, the worst is unlocked completely all the time, but it's just something you have.

347
00:22:57,873 --> 00:23:00,480
Speaker 1: you just put your iWatch near your Mac and unlocks.

348
00:23:00,781 --> 00:23:01,304
Speaker 1: It's like great.

349
00:23:01,324 --> 00:23:02,591
Speaker 1: So now the FBI is happy day.

350
00:23:02,611 --> 00:23:08,940
Speaker 0: They're like, oh just take someone's watch and unlock The whole point of multi-factor authentication that there are multiple factors, right?

351
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:16,382
Speaker 1: I'm gonna have to now like I'm a next iPhone or when the OS gets updated go through all the settings to make sure that Like I turn off lock screen notifications.

352
00:23:16,422 --> 00:23:25,540
Speaker 1: for like all these apps that are important like I can't have lock screen notifications for inbox because of emails will show up and I got to make sure that like you can't do any fucking shit.

353
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,193
Speaker 1: Well, my phone is locked like reply.

354
00:23:27,213 --> 00:23:28,060
Speaker 0: they were like check it out.

355
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,242
Speaker 1: You can reply to text while the phone is locked and I'm like, that's fucking great Right.

356
00:23:32,262 --> 00:23:36,800
Speaker 1: It's like now it takes my lock phone and starts messaging people with it without having to unlock it.

357
00:23:37,022 --> 00:23:43,000
Speaker 0: Literally the whole point of locking the phone Is that if you set your phone on the table and you walk away for a second people can't fuck up your shit.

358
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:47,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, at least they have the feature if someone tries to unlock it too many times it erases itself.

359
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,766
Speaker 1: But seriously, I just like.

360
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:51,660
Speaker 1: I'm sure the settings will allow you to make it right.

361
00:23:52,121 --> 00:24:00,011
Speaker 1: But they kept promoting all this stuff like look how easy it is to unlock or look at all you can do without Unlocking and I'm like that's not privacy.

362
00:24:00,252 --> 00:24:04,900
Speaker 0: But what I also don't get is that all those things Have been an Android for a long time.

363
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,422
Speaker 0: They're just all.

364
00:24:05,442 --> 00:24:07,671
Speaker 1: you can turn them all on like everything Apple does is.

365
00:24:07,691 --> 00:24:09,980
Speaker 1: some is something someone else has done for a long time.

366
00:24:10,461 --> 00:24:12,569
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what Apple's history in the 80s.

367
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:13,934
Speaker 1: We got a GUI guys.

368
00:24:14,014 --> 00:24:15,520
Speaker 1: You mean the GUI you stole from Xerox?

369
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,407
Speaker 1: No, no, we got a GUI before I can.

370
00:24:17,468 --> 00:24:20,100
Speaker 1: it's you know, like even less than in this decade.

371
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,660
Speaker 1: They're like check it out virtual desktops.

372
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,506
Speaker 1: You mean the virtual desktops I had in Unix.

373
00:24:23,567 --> 00:24:27,240
Speaker 1: and like the 80s and 90s those virtual desktops you acted like you invented them.

374
00:24:27,661 --> 00:24:29,228
Speaker 1: So, oh, we got an mp3 player.

375
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:31,740
Speaker 1: You mean like the one that I just saw over there.

376
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,910
Speaker 1: It's like the iPod wasn't the first mp3 player.

377
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:35,860
Speaker 0: So they made a giant update to iMessage.

378
00:24:36,062 --> 00:24:37,959
Speaker 1: But we got a smartphone you mean like the palm trio.

379
00:24:38,502 --> 00:24:43,020
Speaker 0: I don't understand who uses iMessage on purpose for it being iMessage.

380
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:49,018
Speaker 1: Well, I think there are people who don't use hangouts right and all they do is text their friends.

381
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:53,860
Speaker 0: Yep Well, you don't understand these people who text me like never ever text me.

382
00:24:54,642 --> 00:24:57,200
Speaker 1: I text you and a hangout isn't gonna work for some reason.

383
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,094
Speaker 0: Yeah, like if you're at a convention and like data services aren't working.

384
00:25:00,134 --> 00:25:00,676
Speaker 1: Yeah, who knows?

385
00:25:01,078 --> 00:25:02,183
Speaker 1: but anyway So or someone?

386
00:25:02,203 --> 00:25:03,047
Speaker 1: I don't know their hangout.

387
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:06,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if you tell how would I ever know someone's phone number?

388
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,487
Speaker 0: But not their email.

389
00:25:07,587 --> 00:25:09,660
Speaker 1: I don't know if you get in the habit of texting all the time.

390
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,406
Speaker 1: It is using the messages app as your primary messaging app Yeah, and all your.

391
00:25:13,446 --> 00:25:15,820
Speaker 1: you can use it to text you and all you're doing is texting people.

392
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:16,980
Speaker 1: But your friends have iPhones.

393
00:25:17,542 --> 00:25:22,160
Speaker 1: You don't even realize your iMessaging them and the only way you know is because the messages are blue instead of green.

394
00:25:22,421 --> 00:25:23,766
Speaker 1: Yep, and it doesn't.

395
00:25:24,027 --> 00:25:25,894
Speaker 1: even if you pay for text, it doesn't cost you anything.

396
00:25:25,934 --> 00:25:27,560
Speaker 1: but who pays for not unlimited text?

397
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,544
Speaker 1: But you know, whatever.

398
00:25:28,564 --> 00:25:34,266
Speaker 1: Yeah, but all this stuff to add all these fancy features to where if you're iMessaging You can do all this crazy shit.

399
00:25:34,588 --> 00:25:34,708
Speaker 1: Now.

400
00:25:34,728 --> 00:25:37,160
Speaker 0: What worries me is because Google is pushing their thing.

401
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:47,340
Speaker 0: That's gonna come out later alo, which is basically androids equivalent of iMessage and They've stated very clearly that it will not have a desktop equivalent.

402
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:53,400
Speaker 0: So What they haven't said yet is whether or not it'll interoperate with hangouts.

403
00:25:53,821 --> 00:25:57,635
Speaker 0: Like will it just be a front-end hangouts or is it its own stupid thing like iMessage?

404
00:25:57,876 --> 00:26:01,709
Speaker 0: because if it's its own stupid thing It's at least the iPhone.

405
00:26:01,729 --> 00:26:04,680
Speaker 0: people who use iMessage for this purpose are those kinds of people.

406
00:26:05,165 --> 00:26:06,520
Speaker 0: Android people don't do that crap.

407
00:26:06,642 --> 00:26:08,201
Speaker 0: So it'll just be a useless app You can.

408
00:26:08,322 --> 00:26:13,680
Speaker 1: actually people don't realize if you use iChat on your Mac you can iMessage.

409
00:26:14,202 --> 00:26:18,099
Speaker 1: So if you're like with if you have a whole bunch of Apple friends, you can all use iMessage.

410
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:24,400
Speaker 0: Oh and on your desktop coming in iOS 10 voicemail transcription the thing I've had for like six years.

411
00:26:25,022 --> 00:26:25,864
Speaker 0: Google boys.

412
00:26:25,904 --> 00:26:26,225
Speaker 1: Yeah.

413
00:26:26,446 --> 00:26:26,787
Speaker 0: Yeah.

414
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,652
Speaker 0: Also, it'll detect spam calls.

415
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:28,912
Speaker 0: Yeah.

416
00:26:28,952 --> 00:26:31,058
Speaker 0: I already have a spam blocker on my phone - thanks.

417
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,812
Speaker 0: Yep Home automation with home kit.

418
00:26:33,893 --> 00:26:35,080
Speaker 0: They well the way.

419
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,208
Speaker 0: Announcements about updates they may affect.

420
00:26:38,228 --> 00:26:39,372
Speaker 1: they made API's.

421
00:26:39,392 --> 00:26:42,060
Speaker 1: there's an app that comes with the phone called like home, right?

422
00:26:42,481 --> 00:26:43,284
Speaker 1: And basically they were.

423
00:26:43,385 --> 00:26:49,482
Speaker 1: you would if you got like a some let's say you bought home automation lights and a home automation Thermostat.

424
00:26:49,522 --> 00:26:54,881
Speaker 1: they each of those things that have their own app like you'd have a nest app or something right or a Philips LED light bulb App.

425
00:26:55,443 --> 00:27:05,980
Speaker 1: but basically they made API's so that instead of having to make your own separate fucking app when you're a company that makes a home Automation device you just makes an app that integrates with the home kit app.

426
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:09,060
Speaker 1: So now the person can control all their home automation products.

427
00:27:09,722 --> 00:27:13,233
Speaker 1: That with from one app instead of from a hundred different problem is.

428
00:27:13,393 --> 00:27:16,628
Speaker 0: I've looked into a lot of different home automation stuff because I Can think of use cases?

429
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not worth it.

430
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:18,803
Speaker 1: Here's the thing.

431
00:27:18,843 --> 00:27:26,620
Speaker 1: and especially if I had a house definitely but not in an apartment But even in a house I can reach the light switch from wherever I am even in in a house.

432
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:33,640
Speaker 0: Most of the home automation hardware that I've seen out there is hot garbage with zero security.

433
00:27:33,981 --> 00:27:34,282
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah

434
00:27:34,924 --> 00:27:49,170
Speaker 0: that like even if you come up with cool ways to use it and even if you ignore all the problems like the Bugs I saw with the nest stuff where you just literally can't set your thermostat cuz fuck you It's just none of this stuff really works that well like we're.

435
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:53,464
Speaker 0: VR is more here than that home automation is Like.

436
00:27:53,524 --> 00:27:54,207
Speaker 1: they're about the same.

437
00:27:54,407 --> 00:27:54,769
Speaker 1: now.

438
00:27:54,869 --> 00:28:12,799
Speaker 0: VR is way more here than home automation Because VR is the equivalent of the people who bought open GL video cards back when there was one game that used it Like hobbyists, but even the people who are super hobbyists about home automation Find that they can't actually use this shit, and it doesn't integrate.

439
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:20,660
Speaker 1: well And I know there are people who have home automation shit that works like opening their garage door with their phone Opening their house door with their phone changing the lights of their phone.

440
00:28:20,764 --> 00:28:22,945
Speaker 0: Yeah No Look at all this light stuff.

441
00:28:22,965 --> 00:28:31,053
Speaker 0: like the companies have just deprecated an API and just like bricked all the existing Hardware that was out there the nest stuff barely works.

442
00:28:31,294 --> 00:28:32,760
Speaker 0: all these light bulb things have problems.

443
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,047
Speaker 0: There's fights over the standards.

444
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,695
Speaker 1: I'm sure but the people are into it.

445
00:28:35,735 --> 00:28:36,660
Speaker 1: have the good ones that work?

446
00:28:36,801 --> 00:28:38,095
Speaker 0: No, but from what I gather it's not.

447
00:28:38,115 --> 00:28:38,499
Speaker 0: we're into it.

448
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:42,177
Speaker 0: Not all of them are pretty surprising number of problems on a regular basis.

449
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,895
Speaker 1: hmm I think I mean it can't be that hard to make a good one.

450
00:28:45,935 --> 00:28:46,559
Speaker 1: I should just do it.

451
00:28:46,901 --> 00:28:48,185
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's really the case.

452
00:28:48,205 --> 00:28:51,940
Speaker 0: There's a lot of low-hanging fruit companies making really bad.

453
00:28:52,121 --> 00:29:03,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, no one's buying that you got by the good shit If you're in the home if you're into that you're hanging out in the home automation Subreddit and stuff and like you know what the good stuff is right Apple music is redesigned No one cares.

454
00:29:04,141 --> 00:29:11,230
Speaker 1: So a lot of the announcements that they made also are Siri related which is what our main topic is gonna be about.

455
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,436
Speaker 1: yeah, so let's just hold off on that.

456
00:29:13,476 --> 00:29:14,700
Speaker 0: well hold off on that indeed.

457
00:29:16,251 --> 00:29:20,296
Speaker 1: But yeah They didn't announce new Mac books knew that and nothing you could buy was announced.

458
00:29:20,376 --> 00:29:20,657
Speaker 1: right.

459
00:29:20,858 --> 00:29:27,570
Speaker 1: the other big Announcement that I was I was like I was sitting through the whole thing and I'm like nothing Nothing, I care about nothing.

460
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:28,274
Speaker 1: I care about.

461
00:29:28,314 --> 00:29:29,520
Speaker 1: so here's something I do care about.

462
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,829
Speaker 1: Small thing you can used to be an iPhone.

463
00:29:32,869 --> 00:29:36,179
Speaker 1: a lot of the apps you couldn't delete because they came with iOS.

464
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:41,200
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I remember the iPhone kids complaining right, so I didn't really give a shit.

465
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,876
Speaker 1: I just shoved them in a folder on the second screen and never looked at.

466
00:29:44,037 --> 00:29:44,540
Speaker 0: delete them now.

467
00:29:44,761 --> 00:29:47,392
Speaker 1: But some people are OCD and like they have to delete the app.

468
00:29:47,432 --> 00:29:47,894
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

469
00:29:47,914 --> 00:29:49,240
Speaker 1: They got some fucking problems, right?

470
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,143
Speaker 1: They got to delete that shit.

471
00:29:50,304 --> 00:29:51,469
Speaker 0: I mean I would really like to.

472
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:53,357
Speaker 0: there's one Xperia icon.

473
00:29:53,377 --> 00:29:55,003
Speaker 0: I can't delete Whatever.

474
00:29:55,083 --> 00:30:01,725
Speaker 1: so the reason there's actually an okay somewhat decent reason for having undeletable apps Some of them anyway.

475
00:30:02,046 --> 00:30:06,040
Speaker 1: so for example the messages app right the one that protects messages.

476
00:30:06,493 --> 00:30:17,319
Speaker 1: Yeah It's possible for example that like you would be in I don't know a website and the website would have a phone number on it And you would want to touch that phone number in order to call or text.

477
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:22,355
Speaker 1: So if they let you delete the phone or messages app that would be wouldn't unit you.

478
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:24,000
Speaker 1: basically there's integrations there.

479
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:24,905
Speaker 1: Right if they deleted this?

480
00:30:24,925 --> 00:30:33,660
Speaker 1: if they let you delete Safari because you wanted to use Chrome It's like well What if you delete Safari and don't have Chrome or don't even have a browser or Chrome doesn't update like back in the day?

481
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,288
Speaker 1: It's like you click on a link in.

482
00:30:35,308 --> 00:30:37,359
Speaker 1: if someone sends you in Hangouts, and you can't open it.

483
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,664
Speaker 1: It's like you would break your phone.

484
00:30:38,704 --> 00:30:45,470
Speaker 0: basically remember back in the day when they're all the kind of BS lawsuits against Microsoft saying you Can't bundle Internet Explorer with Windows.

485
00:30:45,571 --> 00:30:47,320
Speaker 1: It's like then what do I do when I have a brand new computer?

486
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,045
Speaker 1: I need a browser.

487
00:30:48,065 --> 00:30:49,656
Speaker 0: Yeah, how can I download Chrome?

488
00:30:49,837 --> 00:30:49,918
Speaker 1: yes?

489
00:30:51,521 --> 00:30:53,309
Speaker 0: Anyway, so don't you get.

490
00:30:53,369 --> 00:31:10,738
Speaker 1: there are certain apps that you still aren't able to delete But a lot of the apps that didn't have that kind of integration where you they were basically undeletable are now going to be able to be deleted in the next iOS for example like the compass or You know the reminders app or like it's kind of garbage that like you might not be using.

491
00:31:10,758 --> 00:31:14,085
Speaker 1: you know the You know whatever.

492
00:31:14,145 --> 00:31:15,510
Speaker 1: so that's that's an okay news.

493
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:19,546
Speaker 1: and other news is that they made a new free app And I was getting.

494
00:31:19,566 --> 00:31:21,415
Speaker 1: when they started announcing it I was like oh my god.

495
00:31:21,475 --> 00:31:21,957
Speaker 1: finally.

496
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:24,609
Speaker 1: finally But no it wasn't what I thought it was gonna be.

497
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,859
Speaker 1: so they're like they want people to let.

498
00:31:26,899 --> 00:31:27,180
Speaker 1: they talked.

499
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,229
Speaker 1: They started talking about Swift their programming language.

500
00:31:29,249 --> 00:31:31,680
Speaker 1: They made and hyping it up way more than it deserves.

501
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,840
Speaker 0: They're really pushing it to be a general-purpose language.

502
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,850
Speaker 1: It's not bad language, but you know they're hyping it up.

503
00:31:36,152 --> 00:31:37,076
Speaker 1: Apple always does that.

504
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:40,179
Speaker 1: they talk about how great Everything is when it's not as great as they say it is.

505
00:31:40,924 --> 00:31:42,173
Speaker 1: I mean you can have a fun time.

506
00:31:42,213 --> 00:31:43,240
Speaker 1: go and look at old keynotes.

507
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:50,426
Speaker 1: So they hype something up for being so great that is now a dead product or no longer exists But anyway, so hyping up Swift.

508
00:31:50,466 --> 00:31:50,767
Speaker 1: They're like.

509
00:31:50,787 --> 00:31:55,240
Speaker 1: you know we're making a thing where you can code Swift on iPad.

510
00:31:55,361 --> 00:31:59,460
Speaker 1: I'm like yes, finally you don't need a stupid Mac with Xcode to make an app.

511
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:03,233
Speaker 1: You can just make an app for iOS on an iOS device.

512
00:32:03,654 --> 00:32:04,297
Speaker 1: It's a miracle.

513
00:32:04,357 --> 00:32:06,197
Speaker 1: It's the greatest yes But that's not what they did.

514
00:32:06,982 --> 00:32:13,203
Speaker 1: They basically made an app which seems like a perfectly decent app for learning to program Swift like a kids kind of thing basically a Modern day.

515
00:32:13,384 --> 00:32:16,620
Speaker 0: the heading for this thing is just called literally teaching kids to code right.

516
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,213
Speaker 1: It's you know it's like a modern-day logo like when I had the little turtle.

517
00:32:20,795 --> 00:32:22,340
Speaker 1: kids today are gonna have this which is great.

518
00:32:22,682 --> 00:32:23,326
Speaker 1: It's totally great.

519
00:32:23,387 --> 00:32:27,499
Speaker 1: kids need this because they don't have the turtle anymore And I don't think the turtle would get kids excited these days.

520
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,616
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I. we grew up at the end of the era where the turtle could cause any excitement.

521
00:32:31,636 --> 00:32:33,524
Speaker 0: you draw boobs with it Once and then you're done.

522
00:32:33,565 --> 00:32:35,192
Speaker 1: Yeah, and like you know in the late 80s.

523
00:32:35,493 --> 00:32:38,065
Speaker 1: You know me coding with the turtle It's like that was.

524
00:32:38,085 --> 00:32:40,940
Speaker 1: that was it right, but now this is a turtle for the kids today.

525
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,860
Speaker 1: It's great that they made this But it doesn't let you make an app and get it in the App Store, and it doesn't let you make it.

526
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,959
Speaker 1: it's not Xcode it's not Xcode for iOS.

527
00:32:49,979 --> 00:32:53,667
Speaker 1: and My co-worker was like oh, they can't make that.

528
00:32:53,708 --> 00:32:55,333
Speaker 1: and I'm like why couldn't they make it.

529
00:32:55,353 --> 00:32:55,614
Speaker 1: They're like.

530
00:32:55,634 --> 00:33:00,612
Speaker 1: well here is three Arguments that I countered and he said oh, I guess you're right.

531
00:33:00,632 --> 00:33:05,360
Speaker 1: so first argument was well How are you gonna type, and I'm like dude it supports Bluetooth keyboards?

532
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:12,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like oh, okay, and the other argument was but how can how can it like compile like Xcode is like this huge program?

533
00:33:12,381 --> 00:33:13,920
Speaker 1: How can it possibly compile a program?

534
00:33:15,365 --> 00:33:18,419
Speaker 1: And I'm like an Apple to compiles a program to run on itself.

535
00:33:20,243 --> 00:33:23,199
Speaker 1: I'm like your computer right there compiles a program that runs on itself.

536
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:30,182
Speaker 1: It's like any computer can since it doesn't run on vacuum tubes pretty much Can run.

537
00:33:30,222 --> 00:33:32,429
Speaker 1: it can compile a program that then runs on itself.

538
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:39,834
Speaker 0: as an aside actually vacuum tubes are coming back For audio amplifiers no for processing.

539
00:33:39,854 --> 00:33:41,985
Speaker 0: obviously save this for Some.

540
00:33:42,005 --> 00:33:50,700
Speaker 0: Monday you have a vacuum tube smaller than a transistor Yeah, so vacuum tubes have use cases to replace transistors in certain situations.

541
00:33:51,163 --> 00:33:57,422
Speaker 1: Whatever anyway a little tiny vacuum tubes Yeah, and then he's like the Xcode is such a big giant application They don't want to.

542
00:33:57,603 --> 00:33:58,849
Speaker 1: you know maintain that.

543
00:33:58,909 --> 00:33:59,130
Speaker 1: I'm like.

544
00:33:59,151 --> 00:33:59,954
Speaker 1: you don't have to maintain it.

545
00:33:59,995 --> 00:34:01,120
Speaker 1: you make something completely different.

546
00:34:01,501 --> 00:34:07,860
Speaker 1: You just call it Xcode or mobile Xcode or something and then you make it only develop iOS apps.

547
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,507
Speaker 1: It doesn't need to be able to make Mac apps.

548
00:34:09,728 --> 00:34:11,960
Speaker 1: Yep, or it all needs to be able to make iOS.

549
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:23,659
Speaker 0: and maybe I mean frankly if I could run either net either native Adobe applications or Like the steam games that were run on my regular old non video accelerated laptop.

550
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:28,273
Speaker 0: now I would own like three laughs three iPads, but that'll never happen.

551
00:34:28,393 --> 00:34:30,438
Speaker 0: So I bet they're almost useless to me.

552
00:34:31,021 --> 00:34:32,766
Speaker 1: I've had is perfectly fine.

553
00:34:32,786 --> 00:34:33,610
Speaker 1: I don't need a laptop.

554
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:38,987
Speaker 0: It is what 90% of what I use my laptop for is Running Adobe software.

555
00:34:39,007 --> 00:34:39,871
Speaker 0: I run these.

556
00:34:39,933 --> 00:34:41,320
Speaker 1: I run the mobile Adobe software.

557
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,065
Speaker 1: I never found it.

558
00:34:42,226 --> 00:34:43,976
Speaker 1: I've never found that I've needed the full one.

559
00:34:44,058 --> 00:34:46,708
Speaker 0: Have you Edit a panel video.

560
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,194
Speaker 1: I don't do that on the go.

561
00:34:48,214 --> 00:34:49,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, I do that sitting on my desk at home.

562
00:34:50,101 --> 00:34:51,007
Speaker 0: I do that on my laptop.

563
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,237
Speaker 1: No interest in doing it on the go.

564
00:34:52,338 --> 00:34:54,929
Speaker 0: either I do it on the go or playing some.

565
00:34:55,010 --> 00:35:00,713
Speaker 1: I bet I could still do it with mobile Adobe from here, dude I would defy you to do that.

566
00:35:00,733 --> 00:35:02,480
Speaker 1: I just don't place it five on the go either.

567
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:05,700
Speaker 0: I place it five on the go and overwatch runs totally fine on my laptop.

568
00:35:07,504 --> 00:35:08,458
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're the only one left.

569
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:18,320
Speaker 1: I'll be like the last man on earth walking around while everyone else is plenty hooked in and play overwatch And then my glasses that I don't need will break while I'm sitting in front of the library.

570
00:35:21,522 --> 00:35:31,528
Speaker 0: It's totally an aside, I know I bring this up a lot but seriously I Cannot believe that overwatch is actually the successor to weapons factory Like I never thought that would actually ever.

571
00:35:31,749 --> 00:35:32,491
Speaker 1: next gaming show.

572
00:35:32,511 --> 00:35:35,080
Speaker 1: we can talk about all these e3 announcements like the new quake.

573
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:35,763
Speaker 0: What was this?

574
00:35:35,803 --> 00:35:39,276
Speaker 0: someone tweeted and they were like, wow, you three has a lot of announcements.

575
00:35:39,316 --> 00:35:41,785
Speaker 0: There's shoot man There's walk man.

576
00:35:41,805 --> 00:35:43,512
Speaker 0: There's puzzle man and jump man.

577
00:35:43,532 --> 00:35:44,456
Speaker 1: That's pretty much it.

578
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:52,871
Speaker 0: Yep things of the day.

579
00:35:52,891 --> 00:35:55,344
Speaker 0: so This is a lecture.

580
00:35:55,384 --> 00:35:57,250
Speaker 1: You've been trying to use this thing a day for like weeks.

581
00:35:57,591 --> 00:36:11,320
Speaker 0: So the little backstory I learned a Compared to an average person I learned a lot about elevators about four or five years ago because I was so butter about Connecticut and anime Boston's main hotels having magfest.

582
00:36:13,345 --> 00:36:15,260
Speaker 0: We didn't stay we didn't have to use that elevators.

583
00:36:15,361 --> 00:36:17,180
Speaker 0: I didn't care about the elevator party, right?

584
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:23,100
Speaker 1: but but we were at conventions in hotels a lot and there are many times where there's too many people who overload the elevators.

585
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:26,535
Speaker 1: and obviously there's a capacity limit that elevators have depending how many shafts.

586
00:36:26,555 --> 00:36:31,140
Speaker 1: yup, but It was obvious the elevators are running sub optimally.

587
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:34,992
Speaker 1: They would be completely full and they would keep stopping to let more people on.

588
00:36:35,514 --> 00:36:37,480
Speaker 1: and I got mad all sorts of other stupid shit.

589
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:41,094
Speaker 0: So I started learning about elevators to figure out like is this solvable?

590
00:36:41,155 --> 00:36:42,118
Speaker 0: And the answer was pretty much.

591
00:36:42,259 --> 00:36:44,326
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, just reprogram the fucking elevator right?

592
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,925
Speaker 0: It's not even that hard.

593
00:36:45,965 --> 00:36:51,986
Speaker 1: but people don't program elevators at places that like don't have such incredible Elevator traffic or it's not?

594
00:36:52,006 --> 00:36:55,180
Speaker 1: you know, like some hotel that's got like four elevator shafts.

595
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,010
Speaker 1: It's like how often is that hotel so crowded?

596
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:00,560
Speaker 0: like what is the nerd gonna not go to his convention?

597
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:08,327
Speaker 1: No, he's just gonna bitch every day on Sunday and not realize they just they just put the elevators in default mode And the hotel staff are taking service elevators.

598
00:37:08,348 --> 00:37:09,150
Speaker 1: They don't even give a crap.

599
00:37:09,331 --> 00:37:11,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the smart people are also taking service elevators.

600
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:17,244
Speaker 0: But a lot of people like to think they can hack Elevators now.

601
00:37:17,525 --> 00:37:29,400
Speaker 0: Yes, you could like you could reprogram the elevators all sorts of crazy stuff with it but most people who say they think they can hack an elevator are full of utter shit are Spreading urban legends and just all this sort of nonsense.

602
00:37:29,802 --> 00:37:32,436
Speaker 0: Now I learned as much as I could learn just on my own about elevator.

603
00:37:32,456 --> 00:37:37,400
Speaker 1: main urban legend I've heard I don't know how true it is is hold the number you want to go to and closed door at the same time.

604
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,263
Speaker 0: That's never been true.

605
00:37:38,283 --> 00:37:41,777
Speaker 1: So some elevators it will express no no elevators.

606
00:37:41,797 --> 00:37:42,360
Speaker 0: Will it do that?

607
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:51,588
Speaker 0: Boom the urban legend denied the best case for that is there are some elevators where if you do that It'll still stop on every floor.

608
00:37:51,648 --> 00:37:56,925
Speaker 0: that had a floor call, but it just won't open the door But it'll stop at the floor.

609
00:37:57,045 --> 00:37:59,672
Speaker 0: Anyway, not saving you any time.

610
00:38:00,273 --> 00:38:01,316
Speaker 0: The door just won't open.

611
00:38:01,336 --> 00:38:04,211
Speaker 0: Oh, well, so This is a lecture better.

612
00:38:04,251 --> 00:38:05,380
Speaker 1: Hope it opens at your destination.

613
00:38:06,142 --> 00:38:17,374
Speaker 0: This is you know, we talked about like we go to cons But we don't go to that many panels at cons anymore because very few Pat like an anime con Unless it's like Mike tool or Daryl Surratt, like no one's gonna tell me anything.

614
00:38:17,454 --> 00:38:18,377
Speaker 0: I don't already know.

615
00:38:18,397 --> 00:38:21,954
Speaker 1: man Maybe someone would but you don't care that more.

616
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:30,276
Speaker 0: they're gonna tell me something I don't know But they're gonna mumble it through 50 unrelated minutes of like rambling Sonic the Hedgehog fanfic or whatever like.

617
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:31,660
Speaker 0: they're not good presenters.

618
00:38:32,422 --> 00:38:35,631
Speaker 0: But this right here is a panel from a convention.

619
00:38:36,152 --> 00:38:40,613
Speaker 0: if you want a prototype for the kind of panel that I like to go To at a con it is this one.

620
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:45,030
Speaker 0: It was called Elevator hacking from the pit to the penthouse.

621
00:38:45,471 --> 00:38:56,440
Speaker 0: I believe it was given at a Def Con a couple years ago and They very pointedly gave this panel on Sunday at the end of the con because the panel is two hours of yo-dog.

622
00:38:56,722 --> 00:38:59,119
Speaker 0: Here's how elevators work and how to fucking hack them.

623
00:38:59,502 --> 00:39:02,880
Speaker 1: So if they gave it to the beginning of the con the elevators would have been fucked up for the whole con.

624
00:39:03,101 --> 00:39:04,285
Speaker 1: It's actually a Def Con.

625
00:39:04,606 --> 00:39:06,372
Speaker 0: So some of these things I knew.

626
00:39:06,392 --> 00:39:08,880
Speaker 0: so Scott have you ever seen riot mode in an elevator?

627
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,745
Speaker 0: Riot mode riot mode.

628
00:39:11,166 --> 00:39:14,340
Speaker 0: No, Ella's many elevators have riots mode.

629
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:18,451
Speaker 0: Okay, so I thought I knew what riot mode did.

630
00:39:18,471 --> 00:39:19,895
Speaker 0: I was wrong now.

631
00:39:19,955 --> 00:39:21,520
Speaker 0: I actually know a riot mode does.

632
00:39:22,222 --> 00:39:25,877
Speaker 0: I also know how it's distinct from executive mode and all these crazy mode.

633
00:39:25,918 --> 00:39:26,520
Speaker 1: executive mode.

634
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:32,329
Speaker 1: the only mode I know about is regular mode and Fire departments here mode go directly to the floor.

635
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:33,634
Speaker 1: We tell you to know.

636
00:39:33,654 --> 00:39:35,320
Speaker 0: So what do you think fire mode does?

637
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:41,046
Speaker 0: I knew a little more about it because I got my dad So usually my grandfather fireman.

638
00:39:41,207 --> 00:39:45,800
Speaker 1: usually when there's a fire in a building all the elevators would go to the bottom and open the doors.

639
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,580
Speaker 0: All right, that's that's phase one, right?

640
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:51,689
Speaker 1: It's phase one and then it no one will be able to use them Except if they have the fireman key.

641
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:56,580
Speaker 1: and when the fireman goes in there with the fireman key He can manually control the elevator and go directly to the floor.

642
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,891
Speaker 1: They want and open and close the doors by you know, whenever they want essentially.

643
00:39:59,911 --> 00:40:02,219
Speaker 0: Yes, that's phase two and then that's it.

644
00:40:02,802 --> 00:40:05,579
Speaker 1: So and then they hopefully put the fire out before it becomes an issue.

645
00:40:06,601 --> 00:40:09,979
Speaker 0: Some buildings either don't have the alarm systems hooked into the elevator directly.

646
00:40:10,502 --> 00:40:11,065
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure.

647
00:40:11,085 --> 00:40:13,820
Speaker 1: in New York you have to in a big if your building's big enough, right?

648
00:40:14,221 --> 00:40:22,440
Speaker 0: Or if you have the fireman key if you go to that slot on the outside of the elevators Just put your key in and twist it It'll come to the bottom and open up all the depending on the building.

649
00:40:22,641 --> 00:40:25,129
Speaker 0: Maybe all the elevators in the building will come to the bottom.

650
00:40:25,169 --> 00:40:30,559
Speaker 0: probably now if they're not connected to each other and the talks about This then maybe only certain banks will come down.

651
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:33,139
Speaker 1: I mean, there's a lot of buildings like express elevator, right?

652
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,778
Speaker 1: There's a lot of buildings like really big ones or like they tell you to use the stairs.

653
00:40:36,838 --> 00:40:41,099
Speaker 1: It's like dude I'm on floor 83 if I use the stairs, I am so fucked.

654
00:40:41,561 --> 00:40:48,682
Speaker 0: So this lecture not only it's about 20% like actually like legit specific ways to hack Elevators.

655
00:40:49,124 --> 00:40:52,156
Speaker 0: the rest of it is just explaining how elevators work and it's just.

656
00:40:52,497 --> 00:40:55,287
Speaker 0: it is a Fascinating lecture like Sim tower.

657
00:40:55,307 --> 00:40:56,210
Speaker 1: You'll learn all the same shit.

658
00:40:56,612 --> 00:40:59,100
Speaker 0: Uh, so do you know the history of Sim tower, right?

659
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:05,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, Sim tower was actually basically a real simulator application for tall buildings.

660
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:11,528
Speaker 0: it was a Japanese thing for us to optimize elevators and shit and They turned it into a game because it was just fun.

661
00:41:11,588 --> 00:41:13,636
Speaker 1: and then it wasn't even made by Max's made by.

662
00:41:13,656 --> 00:41:15,586
Speaker 1: it was a Japanese Game called the tower.

663
00:41:15,687 --> 00:41:20,474
Speaker 1: Yeah, they rebranded Sim tower released in the US But for real like this places him to.

664
00:41:20,615 --> 00:41:21,600
Speaker 0: this is two hours.

665
00:41:22,262 --> 00:41:42,936
Speaker 0: like you will be shocked at how fascinating this lecture on how elevators work is and give you basically the gist of it is if you care about security an Elevator is unless it is secured Elsewhere like before you even get to the elevator And then later is just a shaft or a stairway that goes to every floor of your building.

666
00:41:43,157 --> 00:41:45,057
Speaker 0: That is not locked Pretty much.

667
00:41:45,841 --> 00:41:47,449
Speaker 0: So you gotta think of the day I do.

668
00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:49,760
Speaker 1: it's just a quick thing of the day because I couldn't find anything.

669
00:41:49,982 --> 00:41:51,780
Speaker 1: So basically it's a little thing.

670
00:41:51,820 --> 00:42:00,820
Speaker 1: It's like how to turn any cat in the Totoro and you just cut out this little paper thing and you put it on the Back of the cat and it's just pointing out how like the back of a cat's head is Totoro shaped.

671
00:42:01,224 --> 00:42:02,517
Speaker 1: So you put this the white thing.

672
00:42:03,425 --> 00:42:05,260
Speaker 1: You put the white thing on the back of the cat.

673
00:42:05,728 --> 00:42:06,360
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

674
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,429
Speaker 1: And you could just turn any cat into a Totoro.

675
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:10,940
Speaker 0: if any of you own cats you have to send us a picture of you.

676
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,077
Speaker 1: So you can see all these tweets here of people who did it and took a cute picture.

677
00:42:14,097 --> 00:42:18,420
Speaker 1: so You know, I think that they went to the trouble of cutting out the eyes.

678
00:42:18,521 --> 00:42:21,540
Speaker 1: But I think you could just use a little reinforcement to use for three ring binders.

679
00:42:21,681 --> 00:42:26,397
Speaker 1: I was about to suggest the same thing and it would be sticky already and you wouldn't have to like spray post-it glue on it or anything.

680
00:42:28,443 --> 00:42:31,610
Speaker 1: So how to make your own Cat into a Totoro.

681
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:32,134
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

682
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:32,880
Speaker 0: This is real good.

683
00:42:33,081 --> 00:42:35,979
Speaker 1: And if your cat makes a good pose, it'll be an even funnier picture like that middle one.

684
00:42:36,504 --> 00:42:39,044
Speaker 0: You would all better do this to your cats If you have a cat.

685
00:42:39,064 --> 00:42:40,812
Speaker 1: you had to do this in the meta moment.

686
00:42:40,853 --> 00:42:41,636
Speaker 0: kinetic ons coming up.

687
00:42:41,697 --> 00:42:43,142
Speaker 0: in less than a month We'll be there.

688
00:42:43,363 --> 00:42:46,333
Speaker 0: We're doing two of our, you know, foreign anime opener panels.

689
00:42:46,554 --> 00:42:49,951
Speaker 0: We're doing writing game rules Which is a kind of new lecture for us.

690
00:42:49,991 --> 00:42:51,440
Speaker 0: There's a riff on an older lecture.

691
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:51,582
Speaker 0: They're.

692
00:42:51,603 --> 00:42:52,659
Speaker 0: hopefully we'll also be doing a bags.

693
00:42:53,145 --> 00:42:59,940
Speaker 0: We might do it a couple other things But we can't do a lot even though we're actually some of the highest in demand panelists at the show.

694
00:43:00,542 --> 00:43:04,360
Speaker 0: We we run the panels department so we can't actually spend all our time doing panels.

695
00:43:04,681 --> 00:43:06,891
Speaker 0: We got to sit at a desk and get a hotel.

696
00:43:06,911 --> 00:43:08,257
Speaker 0: I do have a hotel.

697
00:43:08,297 --> 00:43:10,389
Speaker 0: It's kind of far away But it's our transportation.

698
00:43:11,154 --> 00:43:12,000
Speaker 0: I booked Amtrak.

699
00:43:13,343 --> 00:43:14,799
Speaker 0: Well, it's an Amtrak or Megabus.

700
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,444
Speaker 0: Yeah, you take Megabus.

701
00:43:17,464 --> 00:43:18,909
Speaker 1: I'll do something else.

702
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:22,560
Speaker 0: Megabus or Amtrak a walk or you can rent a car.

703
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,631
Speaker 0: I'm not renting a car and paying to park it in Hartford.

704
00:43:24,651 --> 00:43:26,902
Speaker 0: No, I Did that once.

705
00:43:26,922 --> 00:43:27,947
Speaker 0: that was way too much money?

706
00:43:28,229 --> 00:43:29,354
Speaker 0: No, I'll show.

707
00:43:29,374 --> 00:43:30,459
Speaker 0: I'll tell you what Amtrak's were on.

708
00:43:31,322 --> 00:43:34,269
Speaker 0: I'm going Thursday night and coming back Sunday night.

709
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:35,112
Speaker 0: I'm not sticking around.

710
00:43:35,172 --> 00:43:35,793
Speaker 0: I just don't care.

711
00:43:35,914 --> 00:43:36,696
Speaker 1: No, I'm not sick.

712
00:43:37,037 --> 00:43:46,004
Speaker 0: Yeah, uh otherwise Pax Prime will be doing hopefully at least one or two panels there and The Patriots going strong.

713
00:43:46,445 --> 00:43:48,210
Speaker 0: somebody and I'm not.

714
00:43:48,471 --> 00:43:54,332
Speaker 0: I might thank you personally if this shows out to be legit just Donated $50 a month to us.

715
00:43:54,513 --> 00:43:55,539
Speaker 1: What the fuck is wrong with them?

716
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:56,403
Speaker 0: So I'll see.

717
00:43:56,443 --> 00:44:03,949
Speaker 1: if that's like a whole video game every month that you could buy a brand new one Why is geek nights worth that much to you?

718
00:44:04,049 --> 00:44:04,552
Speaker 1: What the fuck?

719
00:44:04,612 --> 00:44:10,577
Speaker 1: and if you're so rich that you can afford that Why don't you pay me enough money so I don't go to work cuz that'd be a lot more than $50 a month.

720
00:44:11,401 --> 00:44:13,591
Speaker 1: But they're so rich if they can afford 50 a month on something.

721
00:44:13,611 --> 00:44:14,153
Speaker 1: That's stupid.

722
00:44:14,294 --> 00:44:14,997
Speaker 0: I can afford $50 a month.

723
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:25,095
Speaker 0: I'm something that I think if it turns out to be legit I'm gonna donate $50 a month be to either Neil Cicierega or Crash Course.

724
00:44:25,155 --> 00:44:26,880
Speaker 1: That's way too much money for either of those.

725
00:44:27,061 --> 00:44:29,293
Speaker 0: I respect both of those institutions so much.

726
00:44:29,434 --> 00:44:33,518
Speaker 1: if I was mega rich though I would just pay Neil Cicierega like a zillion dollars.

727
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:37,334
Speaker 0: No, dude, if I was super rich, I would hire Neil Cicierega to be my court barred.

728
00:44:37,575 --> 00:44:38,740
Speaker 0: Sure like full stop.

729
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:43,213
Speaker 0: I would just be like I just go to him every morning and be like today.

730
00:44:43,233 --> 00:44:45,098
Speaker 0: I would like to hear the song.

731
00:44:46,821 --> 00:44:48,867
Speaker 1: Right, he'd write for you the cantarega tales.

732
00:44:49,088 --> 00:44:53,500
Speaker 0: I want pump up the jam set to the tune of time after time.

733
00:44:54,082 --> 00:44:56,189
Speaker 0: Okay, actually legit want that.

734
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:57,494
Speaker 0: Okay running through my head.

735
00:44:57,514 --> 00:45:01,637
Speaker 1: It barely works anyway It's not working for me.

736
00:45:02,101 --> 00:45:03,869
Speaker 0: So people make a bit interesting.

737
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:15,000
Speaker 0: people make a big deal about how much they like Siri Except they notice any except they seem to only make a big deal about it If they're fake people showing you how Siri works online or in advertisements.

738
00:45:16,525 --> 00:45:22,900
Speaker 1: The only time like I'm in New York City There's iPhones everywhere and the only time I ever see Siri being used is at an Apple keynote.

739
00:45:23,284 --> 00:45:24,800
Speaker 1: I never see anyone use it in person.

740
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:35,398
Speaker 0: I have seen someone use it in person only and when I say only I mean literally 100% of the times I have ever seen someone use Siri out loud in public.

741
00:45:35,438 --> 00:45:35,880
Speaker 0: in New York.

742
00:45:36,281 --> 00:45:38,810
Speaker 0: They were showing someone else what Siri is.

743
00:45:39,532 --> 00:45:41,640
Speaker 0: They were not actually earnestly using it, right?

744
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:45,715
Speaker 1: But meanwhile, so, you know, I've seen a couple people have claimed.

745
00:45:45,735 --> 00:45:48,548
Speaker 1: I haven't seen them use it But they claim to use Siri often.

746
00:45:48,588 --> 00:45:49,231
Speaker 1: It's like a few.

747
00:45:49,272 --> 00:45:50,820
Speaker 1: there's a few diamonds in the rough out there.

748
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:53,493
Speaker 1: We just keep I don't know if they're diamonds, but there's few people out there.

749
00:45:53,513 --> 00:46:01,472
Speaker 1: a few bad eggs Use Siri a whole bunch, but also I have a co-worker who use claims and I believe him.

750
00:46:01,612 --> 00:46:02,315
Speaker 1: I don't see why I'd lie.

751
00:46:02,355 --> 00:46:07,520
Speaker 1: He's got the Amazon The echo the echo and he says he uses that like a whole bunch.

752
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:11,220
Speaker 0: But it's like I would use something like an echo way more than I would use something on my phone.

753
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,254
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can see that but I think he's in a situation.

754
00:46:13,274 --> 00:46:14,080
Speaker 1: It's like perfect for it.

755
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:17,640
Speaker 1: Like because the Amazon echo it's like if you don't have I have other stuff.

756
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,428
Speaker 1: So it's like I have a sound system.

757
00:46:19,508 --> 00:46:22,220
Speaker 1: if I didn't have one then that would make sense, right?

758
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:24,768
Speaker 1: It's like it can't control my existing sound system.

759
00:46:24,808 --> 00:46:27,157
Speaker 1: It just is a sound system and home automation is there.

760
00:46:27,238 --> 00:46:29,062
Speaker 0: I can't be like Echo.

761
00:46:29,284 --> 00:46:32,180
Speaker 0: turn the temperature down turn the lights up close the blinds, right?

762
00:46:32,762 --> 00:46:35,444
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I think you know the biggest thing is like.

763
00:46:35,464 --> 00:46:43,012
Speaker 1: so the main idea here is that you control something by talking to it and There are occasions where I find myself wanting to do this.

764
00:46:43,193 --> 00:46:45,160
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, so pretty much only two times.

765
00:46:46,163 --> 00:46:52,880
Speaker 0: One use case is I am biking and I want to respond to a text when I was wearing Google Glass That's well, that's my number one.

766
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,444
Speaker 1: It's not even Google Glass Like I see on my watch.

767
00:46:55,484 --> 00:47:04,240
Speaker 1: there's something there and I just want to either say like hang up or you know Quick text reply or something without having to stop biking except I don't stop biking.

768
00:47:04,381 --> 00:47:06,740
Speaker 0: I just reach over because I have the pebble with the physical buttons.

769
00:47:07,142 --> 00:47:10,440
Speaker 1: Like I could push the physical button too, but I can't do everything I want to do.

770
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,066
Speaker 1: You can do a lot more with the voice, right?

771
00:47:12,126 --> 00:47:12,507
Speaker 0: Oh true.

772
00:47:12,648 --> 00:47:17,099
Speaker 0: So well like, you know, the Google like reply fuck you I'm not coming to your birthday.

773
00:47:17,241 --> 00:47:20,380
Speaker 1: Also, if I talk if I talk while I'm biking that's not really a big deal.

774
00:47:20,541 --> 00:47:23,137
Speaker 1: But will it work if I talk along biking with the wind and everything?

775
00:47:23,158 --> 00:47:23,500
Speaker 1: I don't know.

776
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:26,411
Speaker 0: So with Google Glass it did like scarily.

777
00:47:26,451 --> 00:47:28,940
Speaker 0: Well, it was actually yeah, Google Glass worked.

778
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:32,280
Speaker 0: I never had a problem talking to but that was only kid was on my face with the watch.

779
00:47:32,541 --> 00:47:37,020
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna like let go and like hold my watch up to my mouth to talk into it.

780
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,951
Speaker 1: No, it's got to be able to hear me from where I am.

781
00:47:39,011 --> 00:47:40,460
Speaker 0: cuz I can only do that of going slow.

782
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,185
Speaker 0: I don't know if you get like.

783
00:47:41,427 --> 00:47:48,141
Speaker 0: if you bike like at a high speed You can't let go with one hand or if you bump into something you're dead Right.

784
00:47:48,362 --> 00:47:50,050
Speaker 1: The other time is I want to do.

785
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:53,185
Speaker 1: it is when I'm hold when I my hands are busy Right and not cooking.

786
00:47:53,566 --> 00:47:56,560
Speaker 0: so I'm like I'm cooking and I think I'm knee-deep in a bunch of raw chicken.

787
00:47:56,661 --> 00:47:57,768
Speaker 0: I want to be like set.

788
00:47:57,909 --> 00:47:59,580
Speaker 1: I don't want to touch the phone with my dirty hand.

789
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,287
Speaker 1: I want to say set five-minute timer.

790
00:48:01,328 --> 00:48:05,728
Speaker 1: There's actually Apple commercial cookie monster did this and he's like, yeah He's like said cookie time.

791
00:48:05,828 --> 00:48:14,216
Speaker 0: I want to do things like said cookie timer Set oven preheat oven to 450 which can't do another great use which I don't have.

792
00:48:14,256 --> 00:48:15,660
Speaker 0: how long do I cook this for again?

793
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:21,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's another situation that isn't doesn't pertain to me but pertains to people who can't use their hands.

794
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,889
Speaker 1: Well for whatever disability reason.

795
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:26,820
Speaker 0: that's that's like the best possible use case, right?

796
00:48:27,182 --> 00:48:37,700
Speaker 1: You know, it's like you're missing an arm and you're using one to hold something and you're just like, you know Hey, dude, scary cuz like with Google Glass again while I never used it except maybe you got a hook or something.

797
00:48:37,901 --> 00:48:38,002
Speaker 1: But

798
00:48:38,042 --> 00:48:50,938
Speaker 0: except to show off like I would owe when you're hanging out at dinner when we were in glass all the time I'd be like God like, you know, hey Google whatever and I just ask it a Google query Like how many people live in Singapore and I get the

799
00:48:51,019 --> 00:48:51,260
Speaker 1: answer.

800
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,019
Speaker 1: So it's not that these things are useless and it's good that they're making them better.

801
00:48:54,482 --> 00:48:58,260
Speaker 1: But personally, I'm not talking to my fucking phone in public ever.

802
00:48:58,641 --> 00:49:01,452
Speaker 0: It's not happening like there's no use case.

803
00:49:01,472 --> 00:49:10,076
Speaker 1: and if someone else did and it's like you think oh But if someone else did it like you're worried Like someone's gonna like look at you weird and something and it's like I would if I was one.

804
00:49:10,116 --> 00:49:11,100
Speaker 1: someone else is doing it.

805
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:12,064
Speaker 1: I'd give them the side.

806
00:49:12,305 --> 00:49:13,389
Speaker 1: I I'd give them big side.

807
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:14,715
Speaker 1: I maybe your side.

808
00:49:14,936 --> 00:49:15,277
Speaker 0: I know you're.

809
00:49:15,297 --> 00:49:15,880
Speaker 0: you don't talk.

810
00:49:16,241 --> 00:49:17,668
Speaker 0: In fact, you're talking to someone else.

811
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:20,280
Speaker 0: if you're talking not to a person and you're not on a Bluetooth headset.

812
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,025
Speaker 0: I assume you're crazy.

813
00:49:21,065 --> 00:49:26,731
Speaker 1: I mean even if I'm on the subway early in the morning and Like anyone says anything it's like oh my god.

814
00:49:26,771 --> 00:49:27,775
Speaker 1: It's rush hour in the morning.

815
00:49:27,815 --> 00:49:28,718
Speaker 1: Shut the fuck up.

816
00:49:28,819 --> 00:49:30,919
Speaker 1: Yep Oh my god, do you want to die?

817
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:34,332
Speaker 1: Surprised this homeless guy who's trying to sleep isn't stabbing you right now.

818
00:49:34,573 --> 00:49:36,100
Speaker 1: And if he was I wouldn't do anything.

819
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,159
Speaker 1: I wouldn't push the red button.

820
00:49:38,182 --> 00:49:39,979
Speaker 1: Maybe I'd Brett push the red button after a minute.

821
00:49:40,281 --> 00:49:43,840
Speaker 0: It's funny you bring that up cuz I got a rims-renz for the patreon about that sort of topic.

822
00:49:44,061 --> 00:49:45,486
Speaker 1: That's someone pushed the red button.

823
00:49:45,868 --> 00:49:47,294
Speaker 0: No, no, it's just the whole.

824
00:49:47,635 --> 00:49:59,194
Speaker 0: so, you know in New York Like there's a certain timber of voice like a certain like quality where you hear someone's voice in the distance And you say not turning my back or whatever that is.

825
00:49:59,214 --> 00:50:14,660
Speaker 0: Hey, yep But I noticed the other day that I have an aggressive thing to say to you, yep I noticed that people who live in New York immediately turn to assess the threat and tourists don't seem to react to it right away.

826
00:50:15,701 --> 00:50:17,065
Speaker 0: I noticed that yeah.

827
00:50:17,286 --> 00:50:17,466
Speaker 0: Yeah.

828
00:50:17,567 --> 00:50:21,740
Speaker 0: Anyway, that's the totally aside, but I want this technology to get better.

829
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:23,951
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's I just disabled Siri.

830
00:50:24,011 --> 00:50:25,578
Speaker 1: They're like we had Siri on the Mac.

831
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:28,078
Speaker 1: now It's like it's like dude.

832
00:50:28,822 --> 00:50:33,400
Speaker 1: None of these announcements mean anything because if I get any device that has Siri I am disabling it immediately.

833
00:50:33,501 --> 00:50:43,529
Speaker 1: And you know what the number one reason I disable it immediately Even though I do have occasional uses for it Like there's a couple times rum got my hands full of dough and I really want to set the timer enough Like if I have my hands right?

834
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:45,765
Speaker 0: Oh, I haven't set it up I can't make.

835
00:50:45,865 --> 00:50:48,517
Speaker 1: I have Siri disabled and I can't use it and I'm disappointed.

836
00:50:48,558 --> 00:51:01,266
Speaker 1: I can't lie I'm disappointed at that moment, but when I had Siri enabled, you know, and I wasn't really using it It kept activating constantly and I'm like, oh my god get the fuck like it kept turning on and being like dude Hello, and I'm like

837
00:51:02,029 --> 00:51:02,853
Speaker 0: why go

838
00:51:02,914 --> 00:51:03,135
Speaker 1: away.

839
00:51:03,175 --> 00:51:04,260
Speaker 1: I'm not trying to use you now.

840
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:10,020
Speaker 1: You have accidentally enabled yourself and tried to listen to me when I don't want you here and that happened constantly.

841
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:15,800
Speaker 0: Well every time I'm going to do the kinds of thing I could do with Siri I'm either holding my phone.

842
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:22,040
Speaker 1: Anyway, I can only imagine like sitting there work doing real work on your Mac and like you're just working and then Siri pops up.

843
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:22,502
Speaker 1: It's like hello.

844
00:51:22,723 --> 00:51:23,185
Speaker 1: What do you want?

845
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:24,510
Speaker 1: And I'm like go fuck away.

846
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:24,972
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

847
00:51:25,053 --> 00:51:26,378
Speaker 1: I'm disabling you so hard.

848
00:51:26,478 --> 00:51:26,840
Speaker 1: uninstall.

849
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:33,402
Speaker 0: So it comes down to because the voice recognition is really good like the technology is there like yeah No, it's fine.

850
00:51:33,562 --> 00:51:38,680
Speaker 1: Like even now like my back end of it just keeps getting better like crazy fast better.

851
00:51:38,961 --> 00:51:40,528
Speaker 0: Yeah, neural networks are a big part of that.

852
00:51:40,568 --> 00:51:43,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know the deep learning and whatnots, right?

853
00:51:44,381 --> 00:51:48,051
Speaker 0: But the output of what it does is still like.

854
00:51:48,372 --> 00:51:58,692
Speaker 0: someone needs to do a lot of like real UX effort into making the experience for the use cases that actually would matter to normal people Which I think just comes down to.

855
00:51:58,712 --> 00:52:01,388
Speaker 0: I am cooking Like that use case.

856
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:03,560
Speaker 0: like you said the Cookie Monster set a timer.

857
00:52:04,265 --> 00:52:06,863
Speaker 0: It has to also know what I'm cooking Like.

858
00:52:06,883 --> 00:52:25,379
Speaker 0: the recipe has to be like easy to put in so I can like ask it questions about the thing I'm cooking right now and has to just work immediately all the time while I'm cooking because if it can't answer the question I'm asking I gotta wash all the rotten chicken off my hands or the raw chicken Hopefully it's not rotten and then I gotta go to my phone and futz with it.

859
00:52:25,761 --> 00:52:28,956
Speaker 0: And at that point a hundred percent of my utility was already gone.

860
00:52:29,097 --> 00:52:44,851
Speaker 1: Yep Yeah, it's pretty much really good for things that take one step Like what's the score the hockey game or give me directions or but anything requires multiple steps and like decisions It's like they always use examples of like apps for like restaurant reservations and shit, right?

861
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:48,340
Speaker 1: So it's like, okay, Siri find me a restaurant.

862
00:52:49,981 --> 00:52:53,431
Speaker 1: Okay, get one that has a gluten-free option for my friend.

863
00:52:53,591 --> 00:52:56,440
Speaker 1: So okay get one that has this table for seven.

864
00:52:57,082 --> 00:52:58,086
Speaker 1: Okay, you know it's like.

865
00:52:58,347 --> 00:53:04,894
Speaker 0: thing is even even if you're at a computer in this neighborhood Like you're at a computer on Yelp or on the internet.

866
00:53:04,974 --> 00:53:06,540
Speaker 0: That's still a really hard problem to solve.

867
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:11,020
Speaker 1: Clicking on like, you know anything takes multiple steps and becomes real work.

868
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:17,889
Speaker 1: suddenly the voice thing is he's useless and it's like you just need to click or touch until it has that sort of semantic context.

869
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:20,161
Speaker 0: or I can be like Siri.

870
00:53:20,442 --> 00:53:21,266
Speaker 0: how hot like?

871
00:53:21,306 --> 00:53:23,474
Speaker 0: how hot do I have to make this chicken to not make me sick?

872
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:26,110
Speaker 0: and serious bonds like cook it to This temperature for this amount of time?

873
00:53:26,131 --> 00:53:30,895
Speaker 1: and there's a lot of cotton, you know There's a lot of things where it's like, you know a simple search it can do right like.

874
00:53:31,156 --> 00:53:32,120
Speaker 1: what's the news today?

875
00:53:32,782 --> 00:53:35,048
Speaker 1: Whatever the headlines but it's like it doesn't.

876
00:53:35,289 --> 00:53:39,799
Speaker 1: usually I'm doing a complex search like I get to a street in this police activity And it's like man.

877
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:46,110
Speaker 1: I know I can search Twitter and do the exact searches in this way And maybe I'll find the info I want to be like.

878
00:53:46,231 --> 00:53:46,753
Speaker 1: I can't be like.

879
00:53:47,094 --> 00:53:47,576
Speaker 1: can I be like?

880
00:53:47,636 --> 00:53:48,760
Speaker 1: search Twitter for?

881
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,283
Speaker 1: tweets and this you know It's like suddenly.

882
00:53:51,303 --> 00:53:56,305
Speaker 1: it's a complex query and I don't know if Siri can do that unless it gets to the point where I can Be like Siri.

883
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:58,617
Speaker 0: what's going on at 42nd Street?

884
00:53:58,718 --> 00:54:06,933
Speaker 1: Yeah Right and it knows that you're thinking, you know asking about something that's happening right now And you know and it's not just gonna be like Oh 42nd Street.

890
00:54:24,884 --> 00:54:32,400
Speaker 0: it's very rare that you see this situation because usually it's people want to do something With the technology but the technology like the back end

891
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:39,820
Speaker 1: I really wonder like are the Apple people like using Siri all the time Like if I go to the Apple offices everyone walking around talking to their phone like a fucking weirdo.
