2
00:00:11,667 --> 00:00:12,148
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,228 --> 00:00:14,714
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:14,754 --> 00:00:26,928
Speaker 1: We talk about the board game, Agricola Let's do this.

5
00:00:30,892 --> 00:00:37,110
Speaker 1: So I took tomorrow off work for the sole Reason of I want to go skiing and I don't want to pay a lot of money to go on the weekend.

6
00:00:37,793 --> 00:00:39,482
Speaker 0: See if I had all these days off.

7
00:00:39,602 --> 00:00:50,311
Speaker 0: I would not be using them You know like on these Wednesdays and things I would pile them up right up against the holidays and get like this gigantic Vacation which is what I'm doing I'm getting.

8
00:00:50,512 --> 00:00:53,964
Speaker 0: I'm gonna have the final like two weeks of the year off and not going.

9
00:00:54,205 --> 00:00:59,349
Speaker 0: basically next week I'm going to work and then after that I'm not going to work again until January 5th.

10
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:03,850
Speaker 1: Well, you see the only reason I'm doing it this way is that I forgot how many extra vacation days I had.

11
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:10,770
Speaker 1: So by the time it was okay, I got to spend all these other people already took all the good days Mm-hmm, but I worked it out.

12
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:16,150
Speaker 1: I'm taking the whole week before New Year's off and all the time like right around Christmas off and you know all that business.

13
00:01:16,752 --> 00:01:20,663
Speaker 1: And then of course, I'm taking like a month off next year, maybe two.

14
00:01:21,004 --> 00:01:24,414
Speaker 0: so it all works out - I don't know Anyone will give you two months.

15
00:01:24,454 --> 00:01:26,320
Speaker 1: Well, I got 30 vacation days.

16
00:01:26,561 --> 00:01:28,970
Speaker 1: Well, that's not - that's a month and a half.

17
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:31,197
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not two months.

18
00:01:31,297 --> 00:01:35,050
Speaker 1: It's a month and a half and if I take a little bit of leave of absence, there we go.

19
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:37,702
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wish I could do leave of absence.

20
00:01:37,742 --> 00:01:38,889
Speaker 0: I'll do leave of absence for a whole year.

21
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:41,502
Speaker 1: I thought that they just won't pay you.

22
00:01:41,984 --> 00:01:43,190
Speaker 1: you want to live a year without getting paid.

23
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:49,218
Speaker 0: Well, leave of absence is cool because it means I can sort of leave the job But then go back to it as soon as I need money.

24
00:01:49,338 --> 00:01:56,890
Speaker 0: Yes, you know, it's like quitting but you're not quitting You're just you know, it's like guaranteed job if you want it again, but you can leave it for now.

25
00:01:57,011 --> 00:02:06,088
Speaker 1: See one guy at my work Apparently a while sometime a long time ago took a sabbatical a long one to be a professional chef for a while And then he came back to do our stuff.

26
00:02:06,931 --> 00:02:14,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, see it's like if I could just like take six months off and you know I wouldn't care if I didn't get paid because I got money saved up enough for six months.

27
00:02:15,273 --> 00:02:18,306
Speaker 0: Then I could just live for six months and try to do something else.

28
00:02:18,326 --> 00:02:20,716
Speaker 0: And if I fail Guaranteed go back.

29
00:02:20,776 --> 00:02:27,546
Speaker 1: No problem, but it's been busy at work lately I haven't had the opportunity to wander around and go for like those super long lunches.

30
00:02:27,586 --> 00:02:35,556
Speaker 1: I used to go on but I wandered over today to Bryan Park to check out the ice skating and it was Surprisingly bustling even at lunchtime.

31
00:02:35,576 --> 00:02:40,672
Speaker 0: Yeah, the ice skating over there is kinda it's kind of weak compared to the Rockefeller Center ice skating.

32
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:47,665
Speaker 0: the thing is the Rockefeller Center is much fancier and You know shinier and all that to anyone who's never been to New York City.

33
00:02:47,685 --> 00:02:50,215
Speaker 1: Yeah, you see that place You know, it's really small.

34
00:02:50,355 --> 00:02:54,550
Speaker 1: you see that place on TV or in the critic with all those flags and it's like this gigantic.

35
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:59,290
Speaker 1: There's always like the two protagonists of a movies like ice skating by themselves at night.

36
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,809
Speaker 1: Now there's an hour-long line and the rink is like the size of our house.

37
00:03:04,472 --> 00:03:07,362
Speaker 0: Yeah, the rink is the Bryant Park rink is also pretty small.

38
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:09,330
Speaker 1: It's bigger than last year.

39
00:03:09,571 --> 00:03:11,543
Speaker 0: It is but the ice is still not the greatest.

40
00:03:11,564 --> 00:03:12,509
Speaker 0: It's not the greatest ice.

41
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,782
Speaker 1: They built that gigantic like winter village around it.

42
00:03:15,802 --> 00:03:18,030
Speaker 0: Well, they always do that to sell like holiday gifts.

43
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:26,368
Speaker 1: They got the same thing in Union Square, but it like giant gift thing, but this year They got this two-story like heated building you can go into and hang out.

44
00:03:26,429 --> 00:03:26,770
Speaker 1: It's weird.

45
00:03:26,991 --> 00:03:28,197
Speaker 0: Oh, that's kind of where you let.

46
00:03:28,217 --> 00:03:30,107
Speaker 0: they usually just do like, you know the booths.

47
00:03:30,268 --> 00:03:34,229
Speaker 0: it looks like Oh, they're like fully enclosed looks like a dealer's room at a convention only Christmas.

48
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:35,917
Speaker 1: now They're like fully enclosed buildings.

49
00:03:36,057 --> 00:03:41,970
Speaker 1: and then they built this two-story like building of Buildings among and they got all those trucks providing the electricity and shit.

50
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,002
Speaker 1: No, they got like structures and buildings providing all that.

51
00:03:45,022 --> 00:03:45,404
Speaker 1: Huh?

52
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:46,167
Speaker 1: You got to go see it.

53
00:03:46,207 --> 00:03:46,810
Speaker 1: It's kind of weird.

54
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:49,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've seen it, you know, like two or three years in a row.

55
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:50,794
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, but they've.

56
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:52,059
Speaker 1: they've upped the ante.

57
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,590
Speaker 1: so I went and got Belgian waffles covered in ice cream.

58
00:03:55,051 --> 00:03:56,014

Speaker 1: They're tomorrow My Thursday, maybe That's all I got.

63
00:04:08,179 --> 00:04:10,770
Speaker 1: I guess I should have a gaming anecdote or something.

64
00:04:11,212 --> 00:04:14,069
Speaker 1: I've been I've been playing and s left for dead.

65
00:04:14,812 --> 00:04:16,517
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm playing video games.

00:04:16,598 --> 00:04:18,043
Speaker 1: I have order ecclesia.

67
00:04:18,344 --> 00:04:19,185
Speaker 1: I have played it.

68
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:20,269
Speaker 1: It's awesome.

69
00:04:20,752 --> 00:04:22,780
Speaker 1: It might be the best Castlevania game ever.

70
00:04:22,861 --> 00:04:24,508
Speaker 1: I can't say that for sure just ever.

71
00:04:24,528 --> 00:04:25,333
Speaker 0: I don't know I can't.

72
00:04:25,394 --> 00:04:29,668
Speaker 0: I haven't played it, but I don't know Might might as in as in.

73
00:04:29,688 --> 00:04:38,134
Speaker 1: you know How when you look at a team like in football and there's two games left and they're undefeated up to this point and you know They might go undefeated.

74
00:04:38,655 --> 00:04:39,858
Speaker 1: This is beyond that.

75
00:04:39,898 --> 00:04:42,505
Speaker 1: This is like, alright, the Lions won a game.

76
00:04:42,826 --> 00:04:44,150
Speaker 1: They might win another game.

77
00:04:45,211 --> 00:04:46,857
Speaker 1: Okay, but it might be.

78
00:04:46,877 --> 00:04:47,480
Speaker 1: there's a chance.

79
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:50,030
Speaker 1: I'll give the game that it's fantastic.

80
00:04:50,371 --> 00:04:50,693
Speaker 1: You know what?

81
00:04:50,713 --> 00:04:51,797
Speaker 1: I played on the way.

82
00:04:51,838 --> 00:04:54,730
Speaker 0: how much different could it be from just other Castlevania's?

83
00:04:55,191 --> 00:04:56,235
Speaker 0: Just polish.

84
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:57,500
Speaker 1: polish counts for a lot.

85
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,403
Speaker 0: It's just more of the same.

86
00:04:58,664 --> 00:05:00,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly but polish.

87
00:05:00,732 --> 00:05:06,076
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I could be playing that but after I finished the book I was reading it I didn't play that.

88
00:05:06,096 --> 00:05:14,990
Speaker 1: I in fact took that out of my DS Put advance wars in good job and turned three of my the last A's I have into S's.

89
00:05:16,134 --> 00:05:20,957
Speaker 1: All right, and that was somehow Greatly gratifying perhaps more so than Castlevania.

90
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:23,886
Speaker 1: Am I getting stuck in gay?

91
00:05:23,926 --> 00:05:25,190
Speaker 1: Am I like a gaming rut?

92
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:26,936
Speaker 1: Is that the reason I'm only playing?

93
00:05:26,956 --> 00:05:29,226
Speaker 0: and as no you're in a gaming, right?

94
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,130
Speaker 0: You've been playing anything?

95
00:05:30,752 --> 00:05:33,543
Speaker 1: No, no a rut means you're doing the same thing over and over and over again.

96
00:05:33,643 --> 00:05:35,169
Speaker 1: a lull means I'm not playing at all.

97
00:05:35,431 --> 00:05:35,875
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

98
00:05:36,218 --> 00:05:37,006
Speaker 1: I think I'm in a rut.

99
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:40,281
Speaker 0: Alright you and your rut lulls.

100
00:05:40,402 --> 00:05:40,684
Speaker 1: I don't know.

101
00:05:40,704 --> 00:05:41,549
Speaker 1: What can I do about it?

102
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,215
Speaker 1: I guess I could play mirrors edge.

103
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,359
Speaker 0: you do it all for the lulls.

104
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:56,849
Speaker 1: I Want to play new games but a lot of times new games disappoint me so profoundly that and I looked at like the upcoming games for DS list we.

105
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,217
Speaker 0: There's like nothing.

106
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,650
Speaker 0: it's like Dragon Quest 5.

107
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:06,510
Speaker 0: It's like I'm actually almost considering a stupid level up RPG just because there's nothing else.

108
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:10,002
Speaker 0: I mean Chrono Trigger came out recently, but I'm talking about the future.

109
00:06:10,142 --> 00:06:12,390
Speaker 0: This is the DS is not looking like anything.

110
00:06:12,651 --> 00:06:13,775
Speaker 0: Where's the fire emblem?

111
00:06:13,815 --> 00:06:14,176
Speaker 0: Come on.

112
00:06:14,216 --> 00:06:14,738
Speaker 0: What the fuck?

113
00:06:14,798 --> 00:06:16,745
Speaker 1: I'm waiting another advance Wars.

114
00:06:16,785 --> 00:06:17,749
Speaker 1: That's like printing money.

115
00:06:18,653 --> 00:06:21,065
Speaker 0: Where's like new Super Mario Brothers -

116
00:06:21,306 --> 00:06:27,745
Speaker 1: yeah, seriously We had that 2d side scroll in original style platformer Mario on the DS and while it was

117
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:33,030
Speaker 0: always like Kirby's Canvas curse again Like when the DS first came out at least they were trying shit even when it didn't work.

118
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:37,324
Speaker 0: So well now it's like they've given up and they just bring it out.

119
00:06:37,445 --> 00:06:38,930
Speaker 1: You know, I'm gonna say something funny.

120
00:06:39,491 --> 00:06:42,983
Speaker 1: Where's another 3d Metroid game with FPS and where is no?

121
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:45,170
Speaker 0: where's a 2d Metroid game true dad?

122
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:49,606
Speaker 0: They got in the Castlevania is they're almost the same exact thing, but you know Metroid is something else.

123
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,497
Speaker 1: I Don't know really what's going on.

124
00:06:52,517 --> 00:06:53,601
Speaker 1: I mean, I felt I don't know.

125
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:56,050
Speaker 1: I feel like the cycle has been broken in some way.

126
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:05,870
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess my whole life I've been used to this sort of ebb and flow of Games come in games go out games come in games go out and the DS for a long time has had like the same flow.

127
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:12,894
Speaker 1: And just as I was getting to the point where I wouldn't pull my DS out anymore a game would come along and like it Was this perfect timing.

128
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:15,563
Speaker 0: but suddenly they were like doing Phoenix, right?

129
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,128
Speaker 0: They throw out some hotel does?

130
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:20,990
Speaker 0: there was all this You know weird, you know the stuff coming out and now it's just nothing.

131
00:07:22,351 --> 00:07:24,962
Speaker 0: Anyone if anyone knows a DS game that's coming out.

132
00:07:24,982 --> 00:07:26,830
Speaker 0: That's worth paying attention to now.

133
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,744
Speaker 1: No I'm not one that's already out and one that is up worth paying attention to.

134
00:07:30,764 --> 00:07:37,749
Speaker 1: that is the important part there because There are a lot of games for the DS and the GBA Not worth paying attention to now.

135
00:07:38,631 --> 00:07:41,143
Speaker 0: Actually, I was playing a GBA game recently.

136
00:07:41,163 --> 00:07:48,063
Speaker 0: I went out and I got Zelda 3 Aka Link to the past and because I don't have a news.

137
00:07:48,123 --> 00:07:48,907
Speaker 0: I'm gonna talk about it.

138
00:07:48,947 --> 00:07:52,169
Speaker 0: some People may not realize something that's sort of freaky.

139
00:07:52,712 --> 00:07:54,238
Speaker 0: Alright, there was all the one in Zelda 2.

140
00:07:54,238 --> 00:07:58,452
Speaker 0: Zelda 3 was for the Super Nintendo and came out in 91.

141
00:07:58,452 --> 00:08:05,310
Speaker 0: The Game Boy Zelda came out in 93 Which is totally blows my mind that the Game Boy one came after the Super Nintendo one.

142
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:10,630
Speaker 1: Well, I just I mean Zelda 1 and Zelda 2 had that flimsy like contiguous plot.

143
00:08:10,731 --> 00:08:12,450
Speaker 1: I mean there weren't that many Zelda games back then.

144
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:24,503
Speaker 1: There was the Legend of Zelda and then actually the BS Zelda plot Which I just recently learned of is more contiguous a little bit Yeah, but I'm talking about the the well-known Nintendo canon.

145
00:08:24,643 --> 00:08:24,924
Speaker 0: Yeah.

146
00:08:24,944 --> 00:08:31,146
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we got you know, Zelda 1 Zelda 2 Contiguous in that the instruction book told you they were contiguous.

147
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:36,270
Speaker 1: Yeah They both had a Zelda and a link and an Impa and it kind of made sense.

148
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,575
Speaker 0: There was no input in Zelda 1.

149
00:08:37,575 --> 00:08:39,722
Speaker 1: now, I guess there was old man.

150
00:08:39,964 --> 00:08:41,610
Speaker 0: There was a woman and old woman.

151
00:08:42,332 --> 00:08:48,214
Speaker 1: I like to think that old woman was impas in the instruction book is all the two Not in Zelda 1.

152
00:08:48,214 --> 00:08:49,941
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure now are you okay?

153
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:51,045
Speaker 0: You can go investigate.

154
00:08:51,105 --> 00:08:52,530
Speaker 0: Well, it's pretty sure right over there.

155
00:08:52,651 --> 00:08:54,862
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure she's not in these all the one instruction book.

156
00:08:54,983 --> 00:08:57,829
Speaker 1: Anyway, is this gonna be a sword situation?

157
00:08:58,212 --> 00:09:01,289
Speaker 1: Perhaps Scott and I got into an argument at RIT.

158
00:09:01,871 --> 00:09:06,005
Speaker 1: This lasted like an hour with and everyone in the room was wasn't RIT was here.

159
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:07,794
Speaker 1: No, it was alright It wasn't.

160
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:09,068
Speaker 1: it was definitely at RIT.

161
00:09:09,992 --> 00:09:15,546
Speaker 1: Yes, because I I still had all those remember that Lego bin full of instruction manuals that I've.

162
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:18,817
Speaker 0: you still had the instruction to Zelda instruction manuals out in the hallway where it is now.

163
00:09:18,877 --> 00:09:20,904
Speaker 1: Yes, but this argument happened at RIT.

164
00:09:20,985 --> 00:09:22,390
Speaker 0: I know it didn't happened here.

165
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:26,650
Speaker 1: All right, I don't understand why you're making up something like that.

166
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:31,645
Speaker 0: Why are you making up something or remembering incorrectly and refuse to distrust your memory?

167
00:09:31,886 --> 00:09:37,648
Speaker 1: because I remember very clearly Whose memory wins.

168
00:09:38,653 --> 00:09:40,018
Speaker 1: In the past it has been mine.

169
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:40,941
Speaker 0: No, Jessica.

170
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:43,590
Speaker 0: Someone else agrees with your memory does not mean your memory is correct.

171
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:57,750
Speaker 1: I can get people to say yeah Scott is this gonna be one of those situations where you tried to convince me that I was in Rochester in the theater with you idiots watching the second second matrix movie when in fact I was living in Poughkeepsie?

172
00:09:59,071 --> 00:10:04,646
Speaker 0: Well, there is the perfect example in which you know, I had people agreeing with my memory yet.

173
00:10:04,746 --> 00:10:05,789
Speaker 0: Somehow we were wrong.

174
00:10:05,849 --> 00:10:10,190
Speaker 0: now This is a situation where people may agree with your memory, but you can still be wrong.

175
00:10:10,391 --> 00:10:12,300
Speaker 1: I point out that I think you're just hedging your bet there.

176
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:14,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, this definitely happened at RIT.

177
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,716
Speaker 0: It definitely did not.

178
00:10:15,756 --> 00:10:24,217
Speaker 1: the pertinent part here is that there have often been Arguments in the crew where For reasons of entertainment.

179
00:10:24,337 --> 00:10:28,090
Speaker 1: No one will actually look anything up or in any way try to bring evidence.

180
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:28,612
Speaker 1: We'll just well.

181
00:10:28,652 --> 00:10:31,264
Speaker 0: when we do things happen usually relating to berries.

182
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:32,710
Speaker 1: Oh my god the berries.

183
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,099
Speaker 0: This happens kind of look and learn.

184
00:10:35,119 --> 00:10:35,701
Speaker 0: you learn your lesson.

185
00:10:35,741 --> 00:10:38,030
Speaker 0: Don't look shit up when you're arguing because everyone will be wrong.

186
00:10:38,652 --> 00:10:47,344
Speaker 1: all I want to say is we argued for over an hour about berries and We realized then that we didn't know what berries were.

187
00:10:47,525 --> 00:10:50,254
Speaker 1: and you might think that's stupid But now look online.

188
00:10:50,535 --> 00:10:51,718
Speaker 1: We didn't know what berries were.

189
00:10:51,738 --> 00:10:53,563
Speaker 1: Our argument was bullshit after an hour.

190
00:10:53,643 --> 00:10:55,067
Speaker 0: Everyone's argument was bullshit.

191
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:56,090
Speaker 1: It was fantastic.

192
00:10:57,272 --> 00:10:58,319
Speaker 0: Don't look anything up.

193
00:10:58,803 --> 00:11:00,534
Speaker 0: You'll learn things You don't want to know.

194
00:11:00,977 --> 00:11:06,549
Speaker 1: but at the point when we were having this argument Which I still insist was at RIT in colony because I was sitting in my computer chair.

195
00:11:07,193 --> 00:11:09,910
Speaker 0: Anyway, I still insist it was not because you're sitting in this room.

196
00:11:10,492 --> 00:11:18,441
Speaker 1: I said that it was the red sword and I said it was the wood Sword and I I was pretty sure it was the red sword.

197
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:19,906
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it'd be wooden.

198
00:11:19,986 --> 00:11:20,849
Speaker 1: So it's pretty red.

199
00:11:21,632 --> 00:11:23,618
Speaker 0: Yeah red because it's made of wood.

200
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:24,721
Speaker 1: if it was made of wood.

201
00:11:24,741 --> 00:11:25,183
Speaker 0: It's also the.

202
00:11:25,203 --> 00:11:29,639
Speaker 0: she is the shittiest sword Which is why it is it of course.

203
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:29,840
Speaker 0: Wait.

204
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,307
Speaker 0: Wait, it's reddish brown.

205
00:11:31,367 --> 00:11:32,050
Speaker 0: First of all, right?

206
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,516
Speaker 1: The second sword is the white sword.

207
00:11:33,576 --> 00:11:36,590
Speaker 1: therefore it follows that they have color names until you hit the master sword.

208
00:11:37,152 --> 00:11:39,079
Speaker 0: It's actually so a magic sword.

209
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:41,849
Speaker 0: I just said that would white and magic.

210
00:11:42,694 --> 00:11:45,390
Speaker 0: No, it's red white and actually no we're both wrong.

211
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,075
Speaker 1: Yes, it was sword.

212
00:11:47,296 --> 00:11:50,345
Speaker 0: that the first sword in Zelda 1 is just sword.

213
00:11:50,546 --> 00:11:51,228
Speaker 0: It is not red.

214
00:11:51,248 --> 00:11:53,737
Speaker 0: It is not wooden It is just sword.

215
00:11:53,957 --> 00:11:56,306
Speaker 0: However, I contend that sword is made of wood.

216
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:57,550
Speaker 1: There is nothing.

217
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:01,560
Speaker 0: Why else would it be red quite so fantastic and wooden and brown?

218
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:15,070
Speaker 1: after having an hour-long argument with many different people taking many different sides everyone strongly full of conviction and Then the luminary from on high comes down with proof evidence of the truth.

219
00:12:15,531 --> 00:12:24,009
Speaker 1: The evidence is presented and it turns out that every single person in the argument was equally wrong and no one in any way had anything even resembling truth.

220
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,670
Speaker 0: Anyway, I played Zelda 3 again.

221
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:31,890
Speaker 0: I played the GBA version which is pretty interesting because it also has four swords in it.

222
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:35,430
Speaker 0: But I'm not sure if that four swords is the same four swords that the GameCube has.

223
00:12:35,892 --> 00:12:37,844
Speaker 0: If it's a different four swords, then I have to play it.

224
00:12:37,885 --> 00:12:39,191
Speaker 0: if the same four swords I don't.

225
00:12:39,252 --> 00:12:49,128
Speaker 0: but actually I'm thinking maybe I should play it because if you beat the four swords in the GBA version Then you get an extra dungeon in the single-player version like the hero dungeon or some shit like that.

226
00:12:50,363 --> 00:12:52,516
Speaker 0: anyway Zelda 3 is sorta.

227
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,320
Speaker 0: It's a very strange Zelda game and it's like.

228
00:12:57,601 --> 00:12:59,910
Speaker 0: I wish the newer Zelda games are more like it.

229
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:10,582
Speaker 1: You know, I feel like Zelda 3 set one of those precedents that should have been followed like, you know It was followed in Zelda 64, but then it was never followed again.

230
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:11,786
Speaker 1: Yes, but that's the thing.

231
00:13:11,806 --> 00:13:16,090
Speaker 1: They didn't keep following I mean when the square boss president was set.

232
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:20,545
Speaker 1: Square bosses were everywhere from that point on like that.

233
00:13:20,665 --> 00:13:28,824
Speaker 0: It was obvious you expected them Yeah and in a way that Diluted the power of it yet at the same time not having one felt even less so.

234
00:13:28,944 --> 00:13:35,786
Speaker 1: it created a ritual and the loss of The power of the square boss was kind of balanced by the fact that you added this ritual of gaming.

235
00:13:35,846 --> 00:13:36,027
Speaker 1: the.

236
00:13:36,468 --> 00:13:39,445
Speaker 1: I know it's Coming I beat you and now I beat you Mr.

237
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,068
Speaker 1: behind the scenes.

238
00:13:41,817 --> 00:13:50,998
Speaker 1: but Zelda 3 Set the precedent of you play a little game and do some dungeons and then holy shit The actual game is like 80 percent.

239
00:13:51,018 --> 00:13:54,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, you start the game by beating like this opening dungeon, right?

240
00:13:55,050 --> 00:14:08,450
Speaker 0: then you get like three medals and then you do the castle thing again and Then suddenly there's seven more dungeons and then another castle seven Which is actually which is actually sort of sad.

241
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,581
Speaker 0: I wish they were eight and then another castle.

242
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:14,590
Speaker 0: that way it's sort of like the original Zelda Whereas eight dungeons and then nine is the boss.

243
00:14:14,911 --> 00:14:20,030
Speaker 1: I do feel like Zelda 3 was probably the ultimate of the old style Zelda game.

244
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:24,730
Speaker 0: The other thing about it is that it has like so many items like oh my god.

245
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:28,950
Speaker 0: And some of the items like you don't even get them in dungeons like the Cape.

246
00:14:29,573 --> 00:14:32,430
Speaker 0: You get the Cape like somewhere that's not in a dungeon at all.

247
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:36,190
Speaker 0: You could actually completely miss the Cape and never find it if you don't know what you're doing.

248
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:42,216
Speaker 0: and if you don't have the Cape some of the game is just stupidly hard like You'll not like.

249
00:14:42,296 --> 00:14:44,310
Speaker 0: the Cape allows you to get some other items, too.

250
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,210
Speaker 0: So if you don't get the Cape like you won't get all the pieces of heart and you oh, it's terrible.

251
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:53,478
Speaker 1: But I guess like compared to ages and seasons which were not I don't know They weren't as fun as hell to three to me.

252
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:57,114
Speaker 1: or convert a minish cap, which was trivial Yeah, it's all.

253
00:14:57,154 --> 00:15:01,890
Speaker 0: the three was like the business and Zelda 64 was just like Zelda 3 and had just as many items.

254
00:15:02,232 --> 00:15:04,430
Speaker 0: It also had two different worlds to go between.

255
00:15:04,611 --> 00:15:07,547
Speaker 0: You know the young world young link and old link world versus.

256
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:11,130
Speaker 0: you know Link to the past had the golden world in the regular world.

257
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,550
Speaker 1: Of course, it wasn't the same kind of game from a purely mechanical stand.

258
00:15:14,712 --> 00:15:16,290
Speaker 0: Well, it was a 3d game and a 2d game.

259
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:19,890
Speaker 0: But otherwise, it was like the same, you know made from the same mold.

260
00:15:20,351 --> 00:15:25,330
Speaker 1: But just I'm saying in terms of pure mechanics like in terms of the kind of game you play on a straight up.

261
00:15:25,511 --> 00:15:27,349
Speaker 1: How like how do I interact with this game way?

262
00:15:28,072 --> 00:15:34,407
Speaker 1: Zelda 3 was kind of like the ultimate of the top-down 2d hit stuff with your sword and solve complicated.

263
00:15:34,447 --> 00:15:35,790
Speaker 1: Sometimes time-based puzzles game.

264
00:15:36,432 --> 00:15:41,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, the other 2d Zelda's, you know, even though they did just weren't as grand as all the three.

265
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:46,372
Speaker 0: It's like they kept making 2d Zelda's minish cap, you know Gameboy But why?

266
00:15:46,874 --> 00:15:47,496
Speaker 0: or just seasons?

267
00:15:47,516 --> 00:15:51,170
Speaker 0: and while those are great except for minish cap, they weren't as big.

268
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:58,030
Speaker 0: I mean I beat ages and I beat it and I was like what that was, you know It's like they should just make another 2d Zelda for the DS.

269
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:58,472
Speaker 0: That's right.

270
00:15:58,492 --> 00:16:07,286
Speaker 0: There was another 2d Zelda for the DS also not as big as all the three Nah, and they should just make it just like Zelda 3 only even bigger.

271
00:16:07,407 --> 00:16:14,170
Speaker 0: be like, yeah There's three over worlds and 25 dungeons and that would be the business right there.

272
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,034
Speaker 0: That's all you got to do.

273
00:16:15,054 --> 00:16:21,995
Speaker 1: that game was just so good and the dungeons were so varied I mean minish cap and even a lot of the others Top down Zelda's.

274
00:16:22,336 --> 00:16:26,110
Speaker 1: the dungeons were all the same just skin differently or like there'd be one game or like eat.

275
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:31,452
Speaker 0: Yeah the dungeon would have like one gimmick to it and they'd be really short and small and it would just be that gimmick to the Dungeon.

276
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,690
Speaker 1: Zelda 3 like every dungeon was so different?

277
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:38,886
Speaker 0: Yeah And pretty big too and dangerous like it actually counted at the end.

278
00:16:38,946 --> 00:16:40,090
Speaker 0: it tells you how many times you died.

279
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,655
Speaker 0: I think I died 14 times.

280
00:16:41,775 --> 00:16:42,518
Speaker 0: That's about right.

281
00:16:42,558 --> 00:16:44,384
Speaker 1: something like that for a seasoned player.

282
00:16:44,665 --> 00:16:46,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

283
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,675
Speaker 0: Just you haven't played.

284
00:16:47,695 --> 00:16:52,090
Speaker 0: Zelda 3 probably plays all the three and the thing is all the three is actually like.

285
00:16:53,051 --> 00:16:59,130
Speaker 0: It's weird because the overworld even though there's two over worlds as the golden world in the regular world is actually pretty small.

286
00:16:59,711 --> 00:17:00,374
Speaker 0: It's like.

287
00:17:00,655 --> 00:17:12,125
Speaker 0: Zelda 1 feels like it has a bigger overworld than Zelda 3 like it actually, you know It's like I could get from one end of the map to the other like in no time Without even using the magic flute or anything, but it's the not so magic flute.

288
00:17:12,224 --> 00:17:13,209
Speaker 1: actually Zelda 1 had.

289
00:17:14,371 --> 00:17:19,209
Speaker 1: Don't start that argument again, but the argument about whether it was the flute of the magic flute.

290
00:17:19,691 --> 00:17:21,858
Speaker 0: Well in Zelda 1 the flute was obviously magical.

291
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:24,307
Speaker 0: in Zelda 3 the flute had no magical powers whatsoever.

292
00:17:24,488 --> 00:17:26,390
Speaker 0: How about Zelda 2?

293
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,934
Speaker 0: Now that to the flute.

294
00:17:27,973 --> 00:17:28,496
Speaker 1: What did it do?

295
00:17:28,536 --> 00:17:29,539
Speaker 1: Do you remember what it did?

296
00:17:30,161 --> 00:17:31,745
Speaker 0: You blew the flute and it.

297
00:17:32,146 --> 00:17:33,329
Speaker 1: it did something.

298
00:17:35,551 --> 00:17:37,229
Speaker 0: Made bad guys do stuff.

299
00:17:38,652 --> 00:17:40,941
Speaker 1: It only was usable on the overworld map.

300
00:17:41,002 --> 00:17:44,511
Speaker 0: I know I know you used it on the overworld map Twice.

301
00:17:44,992 --> 00:17:47,120
Speaker 0: well, maybe three they like make something appear.

302
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:47,963
Speaker 0: That was invisible.

303
00:17:48,565 --> 00:17:49,810
Speaker 1: It made a castle appear.

304
00:17:50,191 --> 00:17:53,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was invisible and that's a magic flute then.

305
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,505
Speaker 1: and it made a spider run away.

306
00:17:54,525 --> 00:17:55,990
Speaker 0: Oh, right, right.

307
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,304
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's definitely a magic flute.

308
00:17:58,372 --> 00:18:00,279
Speaker 0: But the Zelda 3 flute was non-magical.

309
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:03,110
Speaker 0: All it did was I guess I would say this bird come and carry you away.

310
00:18:03,612 --> 00:18:04,275
Speaker 1: It amazes me.

311
00:18:04,315 --> 00:18:07,830
Speaker 1: There are a lot of gamers who they played like all the modern Zelda games.

312
00:18:07,891 --> 00:18:13,910
Speaker 1: They love Twilight Princess and all this stuff But they've never played any of the original Zelda's like 1 2 3 6.

313
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,658
Speaker 0: Well, that's like the people who played Final Fantasy 7.

314
00:18:15,658 --> 00:18:19,781
Speaker 0: They're like, oh my god, if I'm a super Final Fantasy guy They haven't played Final Fantasy 6.

315
00:18:19,781 --> 00:18:22,416
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like or 1 2 3 4 5.

316
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:28,741
Speaker 1: if you're gonna play one of the original Zelda's for context and you're not really a gamer You don't really want to like.

317
00:18:28,761 --> 00:18:29,629
Speaker 1: be hardcore about it.

318
00:18:30,452 --> 00:18:36,607
Speaker 0: I think Zelda 3 is the best one because Zelda 3 combines the epicness and but also the hardness like Zelda 64 is.

319
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:42,490
Speaker 0: Actually while it's as big and epic as all the three it's easy.

320
00:18:43,612 --> 00:18:43,913
Speaker 0: So how?

321
00:18:43,954 --> 00:18:46,590
Speaker 0: the three is actually kind of hard in places.

322
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:50,806
Speaker 0: I mean you can always go to the fortune teller to figure out what you need to do, which I did not do.

323
00:18:50,826 --> 00:18:54,677
Speaker 0: but You know, it's it's still places in.

324
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:55,721
Speaker 0: it are freaking hard.

325
00:18:55,861 --> 00:18:57,547
Speaker 0: Some of the bosses was to own you.

326
00:18:57,627 --> 00:19:01,020
Speaker 1: I think Zelda 2 Probably was harder, but it was only a.

327
00:19:01,081 --> 00:19:02,570
Speaker 0: very well the two is definitely harder.

328
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,516
Speaker 0: But Zelda 3 actually had difficulty.

329
00:19:04,536 --> 00:19:10,550
Speaker 0: a lot of the other Zelda's, you know, even the Gameboy Zelda just doesn't have difficulty Even though it's the same kind of game.

330
00:19:10,711 --> 00:19:15,870
Speaker 1: I mean Zelda 1. a lot of the difficulty was just you don't know where stuff is and you got a bomb every wall.

331
00:19:16,231 --> 00:19:21,630
Speaker 0: The other thing is like getting your head like a lot of the other games that allow you to travel between two worlds.

332
00:19:21,851 --> 00:19:22,574
Speaker 0: Right, like.

333
00:19:22,614 --> 00:19:23,980
Speaker 0: the way that works is either.

334
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,209
Speaker 0: it's like there are portals and you can go to them and that's it.

335
00:19:26,691 --> 00:19:32,130
Speaker 0: Zelda 3 the way you travel between the two worlds is actually sort of tricky and and difficult.

336
00:19:32,431 --> 00:19:36,384
Speaker 0: It's like you as soon as you beat the first half of the game, right?

337
00:19:36,544 --> 00:19:37,688
Speaker 0: Well, here's how.

338
00:19:37,728 --> 00:19:38,330
Speaker 0: here's how it works.

339
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,154
Speaker 0: I'll explain it to you.

340
00:19:39,194 --> 00:19:42,590
Speaker 0: right you start out in the good overworld, right?

341
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:47,770
Speaker 0: The good overworld has portals to the dark world, right?

342
00:19:49,611 --> 00:19:51,197
Speaker 0: There's also the magic mirror.

343
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,510
Speaker 0: if you have the magic mirror and you're in the dark world.

344
00:19:54,812 --> 00:19:57,270
Speaker 0: You can use it at any time to go to the good world.

345
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:00,710
Speaker 0: So the magic mirror is actually one way it goes from dark world to good world.

346
00:20:00,911 --> 00:20:12,457
Speaker 1: But the thing is what's brilliant is one the way that the way they set it up to bring you back Which from a game design standpoint was probably primarily to prevent you from getting to places You shouldn't get to or breaking the game

347
00:20:12,577 --> 00:20:18,017
Speaker 0: exactly when you use the magic mirror to go from the good world From the bad world to the good world.

348
00:20:18,158 --> 00:20:21,710
Speaker 0: one way it leaves these sparkles lying there, right?

349
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:29,210
Speaker 0: And that means you can go back to the bad world through the sparkles But you won't be able to go back to the bad world at a different spot.

350
00:20:29,731 --> 00:20:32,138
Speaker 0: So where you can only go.

351
00:20:32,158 --> 00:20:34,905
Speaker 0: it basically prevents you from going to places in the.

352
00:20:35,246 --> 00:20:41,830
Speaker 0: you'll be able to go anywhere in the good World because you can go everywhere in the good world, but it prevents you from going to places in the dark world.

353
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:42,957
Speaker 0: they don't want you to go yet.

354
00:20:43,661 --> 00:20:52,809
Speaker 0: and what happens is as you Expand more in the dark world right by getting new items like the hammer and such right that let you go to new places in the dark world.

355
00:20:54,012 --> 00:21:02,610
Speaker 0: You you can still go everywhere in the good world, but there are portals in The good world to the dark world that you have to find in tricky spots.

356
00:21:03,293 --> 00:21:06,490
Speaker 0: So it's like there's some places in the dark world like the bottom left.

357
00:21:06,652 --> 00:21:07,467
Speaker 0: You just can't get there.

358
00:21:07,992 --> 00:21:14,129
Speaker 0: But eventually you'll get the hammer and when you get the hammer You can go someplace in the good world and then use the mirror.

359
00:21:14,931 --> 00:21:16,299
Speaker 0: It's it is or no?

360
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:17,023
Speaker 0: you then use the port.

361
00:21:17,044 --> 00:21:18,150
Speaker 1: yes other way or anywhere.

362
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:23,206
Speaker 0: See how confusing it is to explain but it totally.

363
00:21:23,266 --> 00:21:24,050
Speaker 0: it's really clever.

364
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,976
Speaker 0: They can actually make a whole game just out of that.

365
00:21:26,056 --> 00:21:30,871
Speaker 1: one game design of Zelda 3 is so perfect and polished It's.

366
00:21:31,513 --> 00:21:32,576
Speaker 1: it's an amazing game.

367
00:21:32,616 --> 00:21:34,280
Speaker 1: It's one of the best games ever made.

368
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:34,982
Speaker 1: Yep.

369
00:21:35,062 --> 00:21:37,349
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely all right.

370
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:39,497
Speaker 0: a Lot of people haven't played Zelda 3.

371
00:21:39,497 --> 00:21:42,188
Speaker 0: I played it again recently and beat the whole thing and got every item.

372
00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:45,662
Speaker 0: so Other people gotta be paying attention to that.

373
00:21:45,943 --> 00:21:51,430
Speaker 1: so speaking of upcoming DS games I had a segue here if you hadn't jumped in but I'll go back like this didn't happen.

374
00:21:52,132 --> 00:22:02,966
Speaker 1: There is an upcoming DS game that you'll probably all want to play at least a little bit What the great Gianna sisters is actually an assistant getting a legitimate release?

375
00:22:03,467 --> 00:22:03,587
Speaker 0: Well.

376
00:22:03,647 --> 00:22:04,630
Speaker 0: It was always legitimate.

377
00:22:04,711 --> 00:22:09,902
Speaker 1: Well, no it was taken off the shelves pretty much immediately And I think I don't know was my cousin's had a copy?

378
00:22:09,922 --> 00:22:10,626
Speaker 0: was you could buy it?

379
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:11,209
Speaker 0: everyone had it.

380
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:12,674
Speaker 0: anyone I come to have 64 had.

381
00:22:12,715 --> 00:22:16,870
Speaker 1: Gianna says yes, but Dean intended it was taken off of shelves everywhere.

382
00:22:16,951 --> 00:22:19,168
Speaker 1: There are lots of lawsuits and stuff around it.

383
00:22:20,193 --> 00:22:23,810
Speaker 0: I know is that everyone I knew had a Commodore 64 also had Gianna sisters.

384
00:22:24,273 --> 00:22:29,162
Speaker 0: So if it was taken off the shelves it was taken off the shelves way late Meaning after everyone bought it.

385
00:22:29,504 --> 00:22:30,450
Speaker 1: well not everyone had it.

386
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,903
Speaker 0: I mean no one not everyone, but a lot of people.

387
00:22:33,446 --> 00:22:42,360
Speaker 1: anyway this game I don't know how this is reported on Kotaku But someone has sorted out all the rights because the game Was basically a lot of work sorting out the rights to an old game.

388
00:22:42,381 --> 00:22:46,815
Speaker 1: the game was basically just a straight-up Clone of Mario.

389
00:22:46,896 --> 00:22:48,381
Speaker 0: it wasn't an exact clone.

390
00:22:48,441 --> 00:22:48,963
Speaker 1: It was 90% the same game.

391
00:22:51,311 --> 00:22:52,276
Speaker 1: Oh jumping hitting.

392
00:22:52,457 --> 00:22:55,090
Speaker 1: you jump and hit star blocks to get your power-ups.

393
00:22:55,371 --> 00:23:01,516
Speaker 0: Well in every run level one looks a lot like Mario 1 1 But the other levels start.

394
00:23:01,536 --> 00:23:05,150
Speaker 0: you know in the second world is an underground world, and there's a lot of similarities.

395
00:23:05,391 --> 00:23:06,795
Speaker 0: But it's actually really different.

396
00:23:06,815 --> 00:23:09,564
Speaker 0: you can shoot things, and they don't shoot like fireballs.

397
00:23:09,604 --> 00:23:10,948
Speaker 0: They shoot sort of straightforward.

398
00:23:10,988 --> 00:23:20,970
Speaker 0: I think and You know there's this it's it's different enough for Mario 1 that I would say it is not a ripoff even though in those days You know a platforming game where you hit blocks with your head.

399
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:27,470
Speaker 1: Well the thing is if you look through the game there are a whole bunch of spots that are exactly tile for tile.

400
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:31,289
Speaker 0: There are many spots, but there are not entire things.

401
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:36,010
Speaker 1: But there are so many spots that the game clearly had to have been drawn primarily from it.

402
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,862
Speaker 0: There was there is indeed an obvious drawing from.

403
00:23:38,962 --> 00:23:41,409
Speaker 1: also the girl's name was Maria.

404
00:23:43,031 --> 00:23:44,015
Speaker 0: Yeah, Maria, Giana.

405
00:23:44,276 --> 00:23:49,478
Speaker 1: Yes, Maria Mario one Maria Maria Giana.

406
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,145
Speaker 1: yes one letter.

407
00:23:51,185 --> 00:23:52,089
Speaker 1: There is no way.

408
00:23:52,993 --> 00:23:54,702
Speaker 0: Well, you know if it was really a ripoff.

409
00:23:54,722 --> 00:23:56,069
Speaker 0: She would have been named Giana, Giana.

410
00:23:57,373 --> 00:23:58,808
Speaker 1: How many Mario's are there between you?

411
00:24:00,251 --> 00:24:00,351
Speaker 0: Three.

412
00:24:00,734 --> 00:24:03,310
Speaker 1: I kind of want to play this game plus got mushrooms and blocks.

413
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:06,178
Speaker 1: Yeah, who comes up with that?

414
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,183
Speaker 1: out of nowhere?

415
00:24:07,283 --> 00:24:08,570
Speaker 0: the bad the bosses were different.

416
00:24:09,192 --> 00:24:10,418
Speaker 1: Yeah, those bosses were what.

417
00:24:10,578 --> 00:24:13,230
Speaker 1: what bosses were there in Mario 1 other than King Koopa?

418
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:13,996
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

419
00:24:14,016 --> 00:24:15,709
Speaker 0: King Koopa wasn't there there was like these other things.

420
00:24:16,513 --> 00:24:20,050
Speaker 0: They were actually more like the bosses from Super Mario Land for the game boy.

421
00:24:20,871 --> 00:24:34,159
Speaker 1: Anyway, the game was trouble and somehow now it's coming out on the DS, and I can't imagine that this will sell to anyone except people who remember the original and Have their old-school credentials on the line.

422
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:35,342
Speaker 0: next had really good music.

423
00:24:35,382 --> 00:24:36,706
Speaker 0: that was nothing like tomorrow day.

424
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,370
Speaker 1: the game had fantastic music.

425
00:24:38,431 --> 00:24:39,985
Speaker 1: That's why there's so many remixes.

426
00:24:46,804 --> 00:24:55,219
Speaker 1: Normally, I'd say things of the day right here But Scott informed me that he thinks it's stupid to say things of the day And that we should just I guess assume that people will figure it out.

427
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:58,733
Speaker 0: I think it's pretty corny at least the way you say things of the day.

428
00:24:58,793 --> 00:25:00,219
Speaker 1: Yeah, so how should I say it?

429
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,126
Speaker 1: Just be like hey time for things of the day.

430
00:25:03,347 --> 00:25:04,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, totally lame.

431
00:25:04,731 --> 00:25:07,580
Speaker 0: so at least it's not things of the day.

432
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,344
Speaker 0: Corny.

433
00:25:09,607 --> 00:25:16,100
Speaker 0: things of the day things of the day Yeah, and you don't sound like a person you know with a mental problem, so what do you got?

434
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,930
Speaker 1: Oh, so check this out, but are things of the day lame.

435
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,475
Speaker 0: No just you saying it.

436
00:25:21,695 --> 00:25:23,039
Speaker 1: Okay, so why don't you say it then?

437
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,370
Speaker 1: Like I offered that you could say it right now, and you refused.

438
00:25:27,731 --> 00:25:31,224
Speaker 0: yeah, cuz we should have a you know like a Thing.

439
00:25:31,445 --> 00:25:33,920
Speaker 1: what kind of thing like someone saying things of the day?

440
00:25:37,824 --> 00:25:40,507
Speaker 0: Maybe not in a corny way It's an encore.

441
00:25:40,568 --> 00:25:42,679
Speaker 1: give me an example of a non corny way, how would you say it?

442
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,954
Speaker 1: How would you record that that thing for posterity?

443
00:25:45,974 --> 00:25:47,179
Speaker 0: I don't have a robot do it.

444
00:25:48,361 --> 00:25:49,967
Speaker 1: Okay, so we get the Stephen Hawking voice.

445
00:25:49,987 --> 00:25:52,014
Speaker 0: doesn't have to be Stephen Hawking be better robot than that.

446
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:53,640
Speaker 1: there aren't that many better robots.

447
00:25:54,042 --> 00:25:55,209
Speaker 0: I think there are anyway.

448
00:25:55,229 --> 00:25:57,260
Speaker 0: What do you got like a Godzilla anyway?

449
00:26:00,105 --> 00:26:00,694
Speaker 0: That sounds good.

450
00:26:02,601 --> 00:26:11,173
Speaker 0: So this dude went to the monster truck rally Bitchin and you know what he brought with him a monster truck a camera.

451
00:26:11,956 --> 00:26:13,220
Speaker 0: You know what he put on that camera?

452
00:26:15,043 --> 00:26:16,580
Speaker 0: No now a tilt shift lens.

453
00:26:17,741 --> 00:26:19,094
Speaker 0: Aha, you know what that is.

454
00:26:19,114 --> 00:26:19,760
Speaker 1: I've no idea.

455
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,763
Speaker 0: I had no idea either.

456
00:26:21,244 --> 00:26:22,908
Speaker 0: and you know what else he did with that camera.

457
00:26:23,028 --> 00:26:26,597
Speaker 0: took pictures besides that more specifically broke it.

458
00:26:26,938 --> 00:26:35,415
Speaker 0: stop-motion the stop-motion tilt shift lens and Monster truck rally, you know what the result is a thing of the day.

459
00:26:35,455 --> 00:26:36,660
Speaker 0: the whole monster truck rally.

460
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,640
Speaker 0: It looks like matchbox cars and all the people look like toy people.

461
00:26:41,361 --> 00:26:45,534
Speaker 0: And he made a video of this because it's stop-motion and he put this cool song on.

462
00:26:45,574 --> 00:26:49,645
Speaker 0: it called metal heart and he aimed the Video after the song metal heart.

463
00:26:49,725 --> 00:26:54,117
Speaker 0: and it's pretty cool because like there's like a little demolition derby with all these matchbox cars.

464
00:26:54,578 --> 00:26:58,390
Speaker 0: It's Just a pretty hilarious video all around.

465
00:26:58,772 --> 00:27:00,460
Speaker 1: Oh, I see how it works.

466
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:03,700
Speaker 1: There's a good Wikipedia thing that explains tilt shifting.

467
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:06,120
Speaker 0: Yes, it you tilt every shit.

468
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,191
Speaker 1: Well it reduced by doing that because you're taking everything at the angle.

469
00:27:09,311 --> 00:27:10,556
Speaker 1: It reduces the depth of field.

470
00:27:10,576 --> 00:27:11,318
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

471
00:27:12,161 --> 00:27:17,235
Speaker 0: Anyway, everything looks tiny like it's a toy and it's awesome and you should watch it.

472
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:22,279
Speaker 0: All right, especially when the Robotic, you know monster thing comes out.

473
00:27:23,682 --> 00:27:29,380
Speaker 1: So we've been playing Left 4 Dead and of course, it's fun, but we haven't really Messed around with the game a lot yet.

474
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,246
Speaker 1: I mean a lot of people.

475
00:27:30,266 --> 00:27:36,399
Speaker 1: when I was younger and a game like this was out I would be looking for glitches and then exploiting those glitches for hilarity and all that instead.

476
00:27:36,439 --> 00:27:39,442
Speaker 0: now I watch other people explain the glitches on YouTube and I just play normal like.

477
00:27:39,483 --> 00:27:53,378
Speaker 1: yes now I have not Attempted this and I don't know if valve is fixed it because they tend to be very vague when they release updates to Left 4 Dead like a lot of the updates say fixed a glitch or Fixed the exploits that we're not going to better than

478
00:27:53,478 --> 00:27:55,964
Speaker 0: Apple Saying bug fixes,

479
00:27:56,505 --> 00:28:02,660
Speaker 1: but I suspected something like this and we're gonna try to experimentally verify the behavior here.

480
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:17,520
Speaker 1: but it appears that if you just abandon your team and just move through the map as fast as possible You can stay ahead of I guess where the AI director is deciding what to do and most of the zombies will spawn behind you.

481
00:28:17,842 --> 00:28:26,060
Speaker 1: all the swarms if they spawn at all will spawn behind you and Any boss zombies that spawn in front of you will be glitched and stupid will probably run backwards.

482
00:28:26,181 --> 00:28:32,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if everyone runs together It doesn't work because then you've got everyone together and it's gonna try to get you.

483
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:39,060
Speaker 0: But if you've got three people falling way back and one person way ahead It's gonna keep attacking the three people and not the one person.

484
00:28:39,442 --> 00:28:42,699
Speaker 1: I'm gonna have to experiment with this and then possibly run ahead.

485
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:47,131
Speaker 0: Yeah Cuz I've thought about running ahead a few times but I never ran ahead that far.

486
00:28:47,272 --> 00:28:54,260
Speaker 0: and in this video some girl just starts running Way far ahead everyone else and then this other guy says oh, I thought we were gonna play seriously.

487
00:28:54,361 --> 00:28:54,843
Speaker 0: I guess not.

488
00:28:54,863 --> 00:29:03,197
Speaker 0: so he starts running and the other two people stay behind and die and The girl makes it the safe room and then the guy eventually shows up at the safe room She lets him in and that's over.

489
00:29:03,882 --> 00:29:18,899
Speaker 1: though in general I gotta say I can only play left for dead with good people anymore because I want to move fast and people just like hunker down and waste all their ammo and their time in their life like Hiding from every zombie swarm instead of just fighting their way through it and moving on.

490
00:29:19,503 --> 00:29:23,363
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely, you know if the team sits in one spot too long It's no good.

491
00:29:23,383 --> 00:29:27,540
Speaker 0: And I think the last versus game we played was was the awesome.

492
00:29:27,801 --> 00:29:29,753
Speaker 1: That was such a close game until the very end.

493
00:29:29,794 --> 00:29:31,784
Speaker 0: when my it's like It's like at first.

494
00:29:31,824 --> 00:29:33,612
Speaker 0: I join in right seven geek nights.

495
00:29:33,652 --> 00:29:42,227
Speaker 0: people already there including rim and rims You know gets on a team with some people I recognize the names of so I'm like shit among the team of people I don't recognize the names of.

496
00:29:42,508 --> 00:29:43,815
Speaker 0: is this gonna be a bad team?

497
00:29:43,835 --> 00:29:47,653
Speaker 0: as I knows At least two people on the other team rim and classic are good.

498
00:29:47,673 --> 00:29:49,260
Speaker 0: are the people on this team good?

499
00:29:49,683 --> 00:29:50,127
Speaker 0: I don't know.

500
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:51,599
Speaker 0: this could turn out to be bad for me.

501
00:29:51,981 --> 00:29:58,307
Speaker 1: They won the first round by like 40 points that we won the first round by like almost nothing And then we won the second round.

502
00:29:58,327 --> 00:30:01,520
Speaker 0: So in the end we were like they were ahead by like five points.

503
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:08,850
Speaker 0: It was this incredibly tiny margin and I was like, ah, I was like, alright guys We got to win this and then in the third round.

504
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:09,873
Speaker 1: We just destroy.

505
00:30:09,913 --> 00:30:11,216
Speaker 0: it was total ownage.

506
00:30:11,517 --> 00:30:20,050
Speaker 1: and in the fourth round It was total ownage again and we wrecked them, but I can't say one thing if you watch this video Times I have played this game with good people.

507
00:30:20,391 --> 00:30:22,740
Speaker 1: the team of four has moved almost this quickly.

508
00:30:23,509 --> 00:30:24,440
Speaker 1: So it is possible.

509
00:30:25,102 --> 00:30:26,600
Speaker 1: Don't hide in the back.

510
00:30:26,861 --> 00:30:31,615
Speaker 1: I feel like this should be something like the the rallying cry of shoot the medic not the heavy.

511
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,266
Speaker 1: move fast not slow Yeah, just freaking.

512
00:30:34,327 --> 00:30:35,633
Speaker 0: go go go go go.

513
00:30:35,674 --> 00:30:35,855
Speaker 0: go.

514
00:30:35,855 --> 00:30:36,216
Speaker 1: 180 miles an hour.

515
00:30:37,212 --> 00:30:43,505
Speaker 0: Yeah Stop when you have to but then as soon as there's an opening go like as soon as it's quiet go Soon as elevator opens get in.

516
00:30:43,946 --> 00:30:49,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's been a long time since there has been a two or three player board game.

517
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,860
Speaker 0: Oh wait hit before we start is an idea.

518
00:30:51,000 --> 00:31:01,745
Speaker 0: You know how when people like running a mile or something or like, you know in in the Olympics and such They have like people who are just there to like set the pace, you know It's like they'll go fast and you just one guy keeps up with them But then they drop behind

519
00:31:01,766 --> 00:31:03,880
Speaker 1: nominate one person on the team to be the pace setter, right?

520
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,788
Speaker 0: Someone is the pace setter and it's like everyone else.

521
00:31:05,829 --> 00:31:08,060
Speaker 0: just keep up with me, you know, and I'll be the leader.

522
00:31:08,281 --> 00:31:13,300
Speaker 1: Well, you go one step further and you the pace setter is also the point mmm.

523
00:31:14,421 --> 00:31:21,123
Speaker 1: Well, I guess theoretically if you're coordinated the pace setter should be the rear guard but that's very hard to pull off unless you're really Good.

524
00:31:21,184 --> 00:31:22,318
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like everyone.

525
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:25,516
Speaker 0: shit You know, there's someone in front and everyone just keep up with that guy in front.

526
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:29,912
Speaker 0: everyone Just do it, you know and guy in front just keep going as fast as you.

527
00:31:29,932 --> 00:31:39,084
Speaker 1: well as we've proven if you apply even rudimentary tactical Thinking and predefined strategy to left for dead The game ends.

528
00:31:39,485 --> 00:31:40,007
Speaker 1: you just wait.

529
00:31:40,027 --> 00:31:41,250
Speaker 0: Well, we haven't played an expert yet.

530
00:31:41,311 --> 00:31:41,993
Speaker 0: So what to say?

531
00:31:42,213 --> 00:31:43,296
Speaker 1: Well inverses at least.

532
00:31:43,898 --> 00:31:44,580
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, definitely.

533
00:31:45,701 --> 00:31:50,859
Speaker 1: Anyway, so we've had this trouble where there aren't good two or three player board games.

534
00:31:50,879 --> 00:32:12,280
Speaker 1: I mean By the way game theory is a versus three player game will either devolve into solitaire You know non interactive solitaire or weekly interactive solitaire or it'll devolve into Two people gang up and have a chance of winning Thereby increasing their odds of winning to 50% while the third person is marginalized has no reason to continue.

535
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:15,754
Speaker 0: Yep, because there are games where you can hurt the other players.

536
00:32:15,814 --> 00:32:17,260
Speaker 0: For example a war game, right?

537
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:23,623
Speaker 0: I can just attack rim or attack Alex right and in that kind of game you'll end up where You can't.

538
00:32:23,663 --> 00:32:28,180
Speaker 0: not everyone is just going to attack the person to their right and be attacked by the person on their left.

539
00:32:28,241 --> 00:32:29,396
Speaker 0: It's not going to work out that way.

540
00:32:29,901 --> 00:32:30,263
Speaker 0: Someone's.

541
00:32:30,283 --> 00:32:33,719
Speaker 0: whoever goes down first is down and the other two people is.

542
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:37,370
Speaker 0: Whoever gets the spoils is probably gonna win in a three-player game.

543
00:32:37,731 --> 00:32:39,676
Speaker 1: There is no incentive to play evenly.

544
00:32:39,736 --> 00:32:43,006
Speaker 1: you want to Crush one other player.

545
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:54,977
Speaker 1: So basically as soon as bus increasing your chances of winning from one out of three to one out of Two so as soon as any one player is weak everyone else well everyone else the other two people should pounce on them.

546
00:32:54,997 --> 00:33:01,800
Speaker 1: and When it's me Scott and Alex playing that always happens because that's the optimal strategy doing anything.

547
00:33:02,242 --> 00:33:10,119
Speaker 1: In fact, it's at the point where if you if that didn't happen We'd almost be disappointed because then clearly someone is playing sub optimally and stupidly.

548
00:33:10,481 --> 00:33:16,182
Speaker 0: Yep, someone's either like just holding out and then not attacking or you know Something like that.

549
00:33:16,263 --> 00:33:21,140
Speaker 0: two-player games, you know if you do that, right then it becomes two two-player games.

550
00:33:21,241 --> 00:33:34,053
Speaker 0: But the second two-player game one person is double power because they have the spoils from the first two-player game and two-player games either boil down to paper rock scissors, yep, or Indirect solitaire.

551
00:33:34,477 --> 00:33:44,447
Speaker 1: Yep So we've had trouble because it's not often we'll get you know The five people we need to play like the optimal set of all the good games we own Pretty much four or five or six people.

552
00:33:44,487 --> 00:33:48,040
Speaker 1: we can play awesome games two or three not happening.

553
00:33:48,964 --> 00:33:57,400
Speaker 1: So finally a game appeared that has provided Two and three player play that does not immediately break down.

554
00:33:58,281 --> 00:34:00,389
Speaker 0: Not immediately, but it'll break down.

555
00:34:00,429 --> 00:34:03,340
Speaker 1: but it has not yet and doesn't look like it will anytime soon.

556
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,274
Speaker 0: And as soon as it does, well, it's sufficiently complex that it's not gonna.

557
00:34:07,294 --> 00:34:12,753
Speaker 1: as soon as the game does break down It's definitely going to turn into one of those really good four and five player games.

558
00:34:12,813 --> 00:34:13,014
Speaker 0: Yep.

559
00:34:13,255 --> 00:34:15,648
Speaker 0: I mean the game is is Agricola?

560
00:34:15,728 --> 00:34:19,789
Speaker 0: I think is the correct pronunciation The pronunciation should be Agricola.

561
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:20,713
Speaker 0: Well, that's what we say.

562
00:34:20,954 --> 00:34:22,239
Speaker 1: No, that's not just what we say.

563
00:34:22,581 --> 00:34:26,132
Speaker 1: That is what the dude what speaks Latin at my office said.

564
00:34:26,152 --> 00:34:30,326
Speaker 0: it should be pronounced as oh, whatever It's like you and your Herakles.

565
00:34:30,848 --> 00:34:34,197
Speaker 1: Well, the the name in Greek was Herakles.

566
00:34:34,297 --> 00:34:34,920
Speaker 0: Are you Greek?

567
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,068
Speaker 1: Well, if you're saying that are you Greek?

568
00:34:37,751 --> 00:34:39,539
Speaker 0: if you're saying the name, are you Greek?

569
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,462
Speaker 1: But so the Scott.

570
00:34:40,502 --> 00:34:43,074
Speaker 1: by that logic, I mean do you ever translate names?

571
00:34:43,516 --> 00:34:44,359
Speaker 0: Do you say?

572
00:34:44,922 --> 00:34:45,563
Speaker 0: Schedule.

573
00:34:46,306 --> 00:34:49,540
Speaker 1: No, I'm not saying everyone should say Herakles.

574
00:34:49,641 --> 00:34:52,880
Speaker 1: I'm saying the name of the person as he called himself.

575
00:34:53,221 --> 00:34:55,268
Speaker 1: Did he exist or as he was spoken of?

576
00:34:55,629 --> 00:35:00,759
Speaker 1: I mean when you read the Count of Monte Cristo and someone's name is Etienne Do you want to translate it to Steve?

577
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:02,766
Speaker 0: Doesn't really matter.

578
00:35:02,968 --> 00:35:04,179
Speaker 1: or do you just leave it as Etienne?

579
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:04,922
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

580
00:35:04,942 --> 00:35:09,480
Speaker 1: you leave it as Herakles or do you change it to Hercules anyway in Greek?

581
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,244
Speaker 1: It's Herakles.

582
00:35:10,586 --> 00:35:14,091
Speaker 1: It was romanized to Hercules doesn't matter Doesn't matter at all.

583
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,579
Speaker 1: the point is Agricola is a word in Latin.

584
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:19,566
Speaker 0: Anyway, so Agricola is what I'll say.

585
00:35:19,726 --> 00:35:24,520
Speaker 0: either way because that is our funny mispronunciation or in rims case correct Latin pronunciation.

586
00:35:25,103 --> 00:35:25,324
Speaker 0: Right.

587
00:35:25,605 --> 00:35:26,610
Speaker 1: It is a simulation.

588
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,354
Speaker 1: We've talked about this.

589
00:35:27,414 --> 00:35:28,680
Speaker 1: We don't have to talk about what the game is about.

590
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,022
Speaker 1: We've already.

591
00:35:29,042 --> 00:35:30,068
Speaker 0: it's a farming game.

592
00:35:30,088 --> 00:35:30,953
Speaker 0: you farm.

593
00:35:31,034 --> 00:35:39,680
Speaker 1: it simulates Freeholder farmers or farm families in the end of the Middle Ages beginning of the Renaissance times in Europe.

594
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:48,446
Speaker 0: Yep, you grow your crops you bake your bread you care for your animals you make babies You take care tell you.

595
00:35:48,466 --> 00:35:50,877
Speaker 1: making babies is necessary and costly.

596
00:35:51,279 --> 00:35:54,916
Speaker 0: indeed It's pretty much the whole point of the game is to make babies and you got to feed the babies.

597
00:35:54,936 --> 00:35:57,656
Speaker 0: That's the hard part And that's it.

598
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,162
Speaker 0: I mean.

599
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:06,400
Speaker 0: it reminds me a lot of Calus in that you sort of have these Board of open actions and when one person takes the action, no one else can take the action that turn.

600
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,975
Speaker 0: It also reminds me of like a few games I've played online like.

601
00:36:10,015 --> 00:36:19,500
Speaker 0: there was this one flash game That was like a poverty simulator and it's like each turn You pick what you want each person in your family to do and you just try to get by without starving.

602
00:36:19,722 --> 00:36:21,899
Speaker 0: You know the same sort of mechanic goes on there.

603
00:36:22,281 --> 00:36:25,558
Speaker 1: Well, the game is a basically a resource optimization game.

604
00:36:25,598 --> 00:36:36,460
Speaker 1: straight up You're trying to you start with a very very limited set of resources and among your resources are the you know The things on the board that you acquire and your actions which are your people that you get to spend to do things.

605
00:36:36,841 --> 00:36:38,567
Speaker 0: Actions is the most viable resource.

606
00:36:38,788 --> 00:36:55,139
Speaker 1: Well, yes, but that basically you take these actions and you try to Use them to acquire more goods and more resources in order to spend those resources to get more resources Optimizing your growth and then having the optimal set of resources at the end of the game to get the most points.

607
00:36:55,801 --> 00:37:00,980
Speaker 0: Yep, and the thing about the game is like the way the scoring goes is it's it's not one of those games.

608
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:02,639
Speaker 0: You want to get a whole bunch of one thing?

609
00:37:03,142 --> 00:37:05,993
Speaker 0: But then again, you don't want to get a little bit of everything either.

610
00:37:06,033 --> 00:37:09,739
Speaker 0: you want to get a whole lot of everything In order to get the most points.

611
00:37:09,941 --> 00:37:16,746
Speaker 1: Well, the game has a certain mechanism designed to where the obvious strategies of these other games They're like this tend to not work.

612
00:37:16,826 --> 00:37:25,355
Speaker 1: the I'll pick one thing and hammer it and optimize it and make this Perfectly working machine that just takes in sheep and spits out victory points.

613
00:37:25,395 --> 00:37:26,820
Speaker 1: You can't do anything like that in this game.

614
00:37:27,281 --> 00:37:39,814
Speaker 0: Well what the game does really well is at the same time as you're trying to get victory points You're also trying to feed your family right and get a bigger family Which means you have to feed them more in order to carry on.

615
00:37:39,874 --> 00:37:41,802
Speaker 0: if you ever fail to feed your family You're fucked.

616
00:37:41,902 --> 00:37:42,825
Speaker 1: you're basically done.

617
00:37:42,965 --> 00:37:46,176
Speaker 0: So and the way to age of steam mechanic, right?

618
00:37:46,216 --> 00:37:55,280
Speaker 0: So early on in the game You're just trying to get this food Machine rolling so that you can get enough food to feed a bigger family to get more food to feed the bigger family.

619
00:37:55,421 --> 00:37:57,300
Speaker 0: And then I'm doing so awesome.

620
00:37:57,702 --> 00:38:03,320
Speaker 0: I can make so much extra stuff that even though I'm also feeding my family I can also get victory points, right?

621
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,287
Speaker 0: but the way to most early on.

622
00:38:06,307 --> 00:38:08,433
Speaker 0: you want to feed the family efficiently.

623
00:38:08,473 --> 00:38:14,040
Speaker 0: you want to get that food as quickly as possible and The way to do that is to pick one thing and go for it.

624
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:22,070
Speaker 0: Right, if you try to spread out early on, you know a little bit of sheep a little bit of grain a little bit of vegetable A little bit of baking a little bit of cooking.

625
00:38:22,492 --> 00:38:24,280
Speaker 0: You're not gonna get the food early enough.

626
00:38:24,481 --> 00:38:28,139
Speaker 1: Actually, that's how I've won both of the games that I won.

627
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:29,282
Speaker 0: What?

628
00:38:29,704 --> 00:38:32,320
Speaker 1: by spreading out a lot early on and not hammering anything?

629
00:38:32,621 --> 00:38:36,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you're not gonna get the food as quickly, you know, I didn't need it.

630
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,780
Speaker 1: I got plenty I got enough food to feed my feet and that's that's the trick there.

631
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,869
Speaker 0: Right is is you want to get the food more efficiently?

632
00:38:42,909 --> 00:38:46,920
Speaker 0: you target in so you have this instinct to target in on one thing.

633
00:38:47,401 --> 00:38:53,719
Speaker 0: But really, you know, you can get enough food without the targeting even though it's less efficient on the food getting.

634
00:38:53,759 --> 00:38:55,208
Speaker 1: but anyway the deal with this game.

635
00:38:55,228 --> 00:38:59,660
Speaker 1: the reason is notable at all because From all we've said it's just a solitaire game.

636
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:05,460
Speaker 1: It doesn't break or fix any of the problems of two or three player games and sounds a little bit of non solid.

637
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:11,740
Speaker 1: This is the point I'm making right now because it all that appears from this to just be a solitary.

638
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,685
Speaker 0: You can actually play it.

639
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:15,240
Speaker 0: solitaire comes which is for one player lame.

640
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,774
Speaker 1: But at the same time that's probably a good way to practice and just.

641
00:39:19,196 --> 00:39:24,740
Speaker 1: it's an easy way to do All the math to solve the game without having to actually do the math.

642
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:33,137
Speaker 1: it's much more intuitive to play the game single player than it is to sit down with a pen and paper and actually calculate the odds and calculate the patterns and all that.

643
00:39:33,258 --> 00:39:35,999
Speaker 1: but Solitaire games suck and I hate them.

644
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,554
Speaker 1: They're just they're not fun because you're not really.

645
00:39:38,574 --> 00:39:39,760
Speaker 1: it's kind of like playing.

646
00:39:39,881 --> 00:39:47,161
Speaker 1: I play a tower defense game and you play a tower defense game and then you know We keep playing it and see who has the highest score and that's it and there's no interaction at all There's.

647
00:39:47,442 --> 00:39:50,859
Speaker 1: so it's an entirely strategic and not at all tactical game.

648
00:39:52,001 --> 00:39:57,434
Speaker 1: This game while it is highly strategic is also highly tactical because there is a Commons.

649
00:39:57,795 --> 00:40:01,024
Speaker 1: the Commons from which you get resources is Extremely limited.

650
00:40:01,325 --> 00:40:08,249
Speaker 1: every round if you take an action and every action is unique No one else can take that action at all.

651
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:09,111
Speaker 0: Not that round.

652
00:40:09,192 --> 00:40:17,939
Speaker 0: Anyway, so for example if I take wood this round No one else can take wood And in fact, I've emptied the wood bin and the wood bin will fill up slowly.

653
00:40:18,381 --> 00:40:20,529
Speaker 0: Well relatively slowly but at the same time.

654
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:34,640
Speaker 1: to the other cool thing that while this is so limited The rules in terms of what you can do with the resources you spend Unlike most other German board games and most other games are not fiddly and not arbitrarily limited.

655
00:40:35,044 --> 00:40:45,041
Speaker 1: If you take the build action you can build as many things as you can possibly afford in whatever configuration you want and a lot of times when you build something it'll Give you an.

656
00:40:45,262 --> 00:40:45,844
Speaker 0: and/or.

657
00:40:45,924 --> 00:40:51,020
Speaker 0: it's like yeah build part pieces for your build rooms in your hut and or build stables.

658
00:40:51,221 --> 00:40:51,684
Speaker 0: We don't care.

659
00:40:51,744 --> 00:40:54,340
Speaker 0: build as many stables and hut rooms as you want go nuts.

660
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:56,200
Speaker 0: It's like wow two different things.

661
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:01,480
Speaker 0: You can do it like so fields as many as you want and bake bread as many as you want at the same time.

662
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,145
Speaker 0: It's like so.

663
00:41:02,185 --> 00:41:04,239
Speaker 1: there's definitely this desire to one.

664
00:41:04,821 --> 00:41:10,640
Speaker 1: Tactically, you might want to take a suboptimal action to prevent your opponent from taking an extremely example.

665
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:18,797
Speaker 0: You might want to sew without baking bread just to prevent your opponent from sewing and baking bread But at the same because then you'll you'll starve them and then they're age of steamed.

666
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:26,300
Speaker 1: It's over Yep, but at the same time you have this instinct, which is probably a good one to build up resources and build up resources.

667
00:41:26,724 --> 00:41:31,612
Speaker 1: this is also I think why the extremely powerful nature of taking an action does.

668
00:41:31,632 --> 00:41:33,339
Speaker 1: denying it to everyone else doesn't break the game.

669
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:45,819
Speaker 1: if You save up your resources in an optimal configuration Then you can take that action later and have the same effect because you can spend all the resources you've gathered up to this point.

670
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:52,980
Speaker 1: while The other person took the action earlier They spent all the resources they had but they didn't get as much out of the taking of the build action.

671
00:41:53,442 --> 00:41:58,907
Speaker 1: Yep, so basically the game's resource mechanics are Very enough and fiddly enough.

672
00:41:58,927 --> 00:42:00,353
Speaker 1: I mean building materials.

673
00:42:00,373 --> 00:42:02,120
Speaker 1: There's wood and there's reeds and there's stone.

674
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:07,280
Speaker 1: There's a whole bunch of different kinds of animals and you have two pastures for all of them and stables and all that business.

675
00:42:07,982 --> 00:42:09,426
Speaker 1: There's different kinds of crops.

676
00:42:09,466 --> 00:42:10,489
Speaker 1: There's different buildings.

677
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:11,893
Speaker 1: There's specialists.

678
00:42:12,194 --> 00:42:21,682
Speaker 1: There's so many things in the game that they skirt the line between so many, you know good game design solely through obscurity and Obscurity.

679
00:42:21,722 --> 00:42:25,010
Speaker 1: that makes the game good and challenging and intellectually stimulating.

680
00:42:25,051 --> 00:42:34,580
Speaker 0: It also skirts the line between just randomness going on But also, you know some sort of you know complex and varied controls that are somehow equal.

681
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:43,607
Speaker 1: But luckily the game does a fantastic job of having a lot of randomness the randomness thus preventing Set strategies like Puerto Rico.

682
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:52,754
Speaker 1: The only randomness is the plantations and at least in the three-player game It's pretty much a solved on deal and there's no there really isn't any effective randomness.

683
00:42:52,774 --> 00:43:01,360
Speaker 1: because you can you can as a player mitigate the randomness so much and The amount of randomness that is there is so little that the game will still break down.

684
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,883
Speaker 0: Yep, but in Agricola.

685
00:43:02,964 --> 00:43:09,680
Speaker 0: right you get at the beginning of the game every player gets seven minor improvement cards and seven occupation cards.

686
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:17,466
Speaker 0: There are also is a tray with I think ten or twelve major Improvement cards that are available to everyone.

687
00:43:18,048 --> 00:43:21,900
Speaker 0: and these all these cards are basically sort of like buildings in Puerto Rico.

688
00:43:22,061 --> 00:43:30,500
Speaker 0: Right you you you find some way to play them in front of you by you know paying the cost the appropriate cost and then They you know give you new abilities or powers.

689
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:33,830
Speaker 0: And there's a lot of them and they all have different powers.

690
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:39,856
Speaker 0: and in some ways if you draw better ones or better Combination of them at the beginning of the game because you can never draw anymore.

691
00:43:39,897 --> 00:43:42,311
Speaker 0: That's it That's the 14 cards you get that's it.

692
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:43,780
Speaker 0: never know more, right?

693
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:46,637
Speaker 1: well, there are some things that change that but we don't have to get into that but

694
00:43:47,942 --> 00:43:54,532
Speaker 0: You know they if you draw better cards, maybe you'll have an advantage Maybe you won't you will be different from the other players,

695
00:43:54,592 --> 00:44:04,960
Speaker 1: but the brilliance of this game This is I think what stands out in the game more than anything and it wasn't obvious to us right away And it probably wouldn't be obvious to you if you just played the game sight unseen.

696
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:14,617
Speaker 1: But early on one of the first games Scott played He you know he has all these professions the people because one thing you can do is play these people and they all have these different effects.

697
00:44:15,961 --> 00:44:22,731
Speaker 1: You feel like you like you can make all these combos like wow if I get all four of these guys and play like they're All great, and you feel like you want to use them all.

698
00:44:22,751 --> 00:44:24,159
Speaker 1: and Scott tried to use a lot of them.

699
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:32,867
Speaker 1: But looking at the game you probably unless you're playing a very specific strategy will only ever play maybe two of them.

700
00:44:32,927 --> 00:44:39,860
Speaker 1: the majority of the cards you have in your hand both improvements and Professions will go unplayed and are expected to go on played.

701
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:48,335
Speaker 1: It's not that you're supposed to use them all and bring them all out at the right time It's that you are given all these tactical and strategic options.

702
00:44:48,836 --> 00:44:51,359
Speaker 1: It's kind of like a randomized draft.

703
00:44:52,303 --> 00:44:54,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean the thing is right with the cards.

704
00:44:54,791 --> 00:44:58,894
Speaker 0: let's say there's a card that says four ears a card I I know actually right.

705
00:44:58,975 --> 00:45:09,440
Speaker 0: it says If you have this card in front of you And you build the fourth room in your house you automatically get the fifth room in your house.

706
00:45:09,922 --> 00:45:14,180
Speaker 0: Right so think about this you have to spend an action to play this card.

707
00:45:14,823 --> 00:45:21,080
Speaker 0: Then you have to spend another action to build the fourth room in your house And then you automatically get the fifth room in your house, right?

708
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:22,969
Speaker 0: What does that get you?

709
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:24,560
Speaker 0: well you spent two actions?

710
00:45:25,042 --> 00:45:27,291
Speaker 0: And you saved the resources.

711
00:45:27,311 --> 00:45:29,620
Speaker 0: it costs normally to build a house room.

712
00:45:29,761 --> 00:45:32,620
Speaker 0: So it's like how much does it cost to build a house room like five?

713
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,369
Speaker 0: Resources in or five wooden to read something like that.

714
00:45:35,972 --> 00:45:38,180
Speaker 0: so basically the card saves you five wooden to read.

715
00:45:39,861 --> 00:45:45,680
Speaker 0: If you know you had an extra read lying around and there's five wood lying on a wood spot.

716
00:45:46,182 --> 00:46:00,430
Speaker 0: You could spend two actions to take the wood and then build the fourth room in your house and thus you're still spending two actions and Still getting the fifth room in the house You know at the same cost of resources and actions.

717
00:46:00,872 --> 00:46:06,940
Speaker 0: so the card didn't actually save you anything Except now you have a card in front of you that might get you points.

718
00:46:07,101 --> 00:46:11,660
Speaker 0: You know if it has points associated with it Or if another card allows you to get points based on cards.

719
00:46:12,222 --> 00:46:24,934
Speaker 0: So if a card doesn't save you an action or save you Resources that you couldn't have gotten with one action Then it's really sort of no difference if you use the card or don't.

720
00:46:25,335 --> 00:46:35,500
Speaker 0: the only difference it makes is Well for the other players you're either going to block up the play card action or block up the get resource action.

721
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:47,159
Speaker 0: So it basically just gives you a most of the time a different way to do the same thing Except for the rare cases where it actually saves you an action, which is when you definitely want to do it.

722
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, it doesn't save you an action.

723
00:46:49,351 --> 00:46:51,421
Speaker 0: doing it is sort of yes No Maybe

724
00:46:51,461 --> 00:47:02,120
Speaker 1: but the kind of the randomized draft coupled with the fact that you get it gives you all these kind of tactical and strategic Options, I mean you see all your cards at the beginning and you can make your strategy based on that.

725
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:04,068
Speaker 0: You're not drawing the cards throughout the game.

726
00:47:04,208 --> 00:47:07,020
Speaker 0: You know, you're it's all the beginning and then you make a plan based on it.

727
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:20,339
Speaker 1: Yes, and you can definitely have a very very clear strategy a very precise strategy, but at the same time you have to be tactically agile and able to react to what the other players are doing and be able to anticipate what the other players will do.

728
00:47:20,359 --> 00:47:30,100
Speaker 1: and these factors more so than the complexity of the math of the game are Probably what are going to give it the longer play time that it otherwise might not have worn.

729
00:47:30,482 --> 00:47:38,586
Speaker 0: The other things about the game that are that are interesting to note is that number one If you play with different numbers of players the game actually changes drastically.

730
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:43,139
Speaker 0: like all these new actions come out and all these new cards come out and the game is completely different.

731
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,726
Speaker 0: so It scales very well.

732
00:47:44,766 --> 00:47:46,797
Speaker 0: I mean this thing is from one to six players.

733
00:47:46,857 --> 00:47:50,671
Speaker 1: It also has There are multiple decks of cards.

734
00:47:50,811 --> 00:47:52,035
Speaker 0: Well that there's two.

735
00:47:52,075 --> 00:47:53,420
Speaker 0: there's two things going on here, right?

736
00:47:53,660 --> 00:48:01,800
Speaker 0: There's you get a lot of cards with the game Right and the cards are minor improvements and occupations of the two kinds of cards in each deck.

737
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:09,500
Speaker 0: Right, there is the complex deck the interactive deck the basic deck and the Z man.

738
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,827
Speaker 0: Who's the US publisher expansion deck?

739
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:14,716
Speaker 0: so you can mix up the cards any which way you want.

740
00:48:14,736 --> 00:48:15,820
Speaker 0: if you think a card is?

741
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,425
Speaker 0: Unbalanced get it out of there.

742
00:48:17,646 --> 00:48:25,633
Speaker 0: Right if you think a card is too weak get it out of there, you know You can just mix and match the cards to make any deck you want.

743
00:48:25,673 --> 00:48:30,960
Speaker 0: as long as there are at least seven cards of each Kind per player everyone will get enough cards.

744
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:33,309
Speaker 0: so it doesn't matter which cards you have in there.

745
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:35,717
Speaker 0: as long as you think they're fair put them in.

746
00:48:35,878 --> 00:48:37,344
Speaker 0: if you think they're Unfair take them out.

747
00:48:37,766 --> 00:48:41,120
Speaker 0: and if you want a game that's more interactive just use the interactive deck.

748
00:48:41,241 --> 00:48:44,277
Speaker 0: If you think one again is more complex use just the complex deck.

749
00:48:44,298 --> 00:48:47,399
Speaker 0: if you want a game That's random shuffle all the cards together and go nuts.

750
00:48:48,042 --> 00:48:53,260
Speaker 0: You know plus a lot of the cards are like this card is only for three and up player games.

751
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,500
Speaker 0: This card is only for four and up player games.

752
00:48:55,962 --> 00:49:04,657
Speaker 0: So you won't put those cards in when there's like two players because they won't mess up Really break the game or they won't work because other things change in the two-player game.

753
00:49:04,677 --> 00:49:05,560
Speaker 0: The card won't make sense.

754
00:49:05,707 --> 00:49:31,475
Speaker 1: Yeah now the one thing I guess my enjoyment in this game one thing that really stands out is that you know like the difference between Age of steam and railroad tycoon was that you feel like you're accomplishing something and Few games like this have ever instilled in me a sense of accomplishment like this game does but at the same time have Hit me so hard and made me feel at times Simultaneously like I was accomplishing so little.

755
00:49:31,495 --> 00:49:35,937
Speaker 0: yes Like you start out with Jack and she start with the meager ist of crap.

756
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:38,360
Speaker 0: You got like two people in a hut.

757
00:49:38,982 --> 00:49:41,430
Speaker 1: You start with nothing and all of the option.

758
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:42,533
Speaker 1: like the things you do.

759
00:49:42,734 --> 00:49:44,660
Speaker 1: the options you have are pitiful.

760
00:49:45,021 --> 00:49:46,586
Speaker 0: It's like one grain.

761
00:49:46,827 --> 00:49:52,528
Speaker 1: take a tiny bit of stuff put out plow one field And they're the first like.

762
00:49:52,548 --> 00:49:53,312
Speaker 1: you'll go through the whole.

763
00:49:53,413 --> 00:49:59,040
Speaker 1: like the game actually plays really quickly Except for the time people spend thinking and the whole like first set of the game.

764
00:49:59,703 --> 00:50:06,572
Speaker 1: You're making very important very heady decisions But yet the fruits of your labor do not come into play.

765
00:50:07,094 --> 00:50:10,626
Speaker 0: for you know five or six turns Yeah And you have to feed your people.

766
00:50:10,666 --> 00:50:19,800
Speaker 1: like the harvest comes quickly you have to set in motion Events in turn one that will come into fruition in turn five and be ready for that.

767
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:20,964
Speaker 1: Then the whole.

768
00:50:20,984 --> 00:50:25,340
Speaker 0: if you don't have enough food you will starve and then you basically just lose if you can't feed your people.

769
00:50:25,945 --> 00:50:27,318
Speaker 0: All right, it's basically just you're out.

770
00:50:28,184 --> 00:50:34,788
Speaker 0: the thing I've always wondered right and that no one's tried yet is Consider this the the begging strategy.

771
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:35,651
Speaker 1: Yes.

772
00:50:35,691 --> 00:50:37,757
Speaker 1: The game is specifically designed to prevent that.

773
00:50:38,218 --> 00:50:38,720
Speaker 0: is it really?

774
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:45,080
Speaker 1: Yes, because remember you take more begging if you have if your food deficit is greater.

775
00:50:45,183 --> 00:50:45,659
Speaker 0: That's true.

776
00:50:45,801 --> 00:50:53,893
Speaker 1: But if you didn't then the obvious strategy is at one point in the game Beg produce zero food and just go crazy with the victory points.

777
00:50:53,974 --> 00:50:55,358
Speaker 0: No, no, no, here's my.

778
00:50:55,398 --> 00:50:56,742
Speaker 0: here's the strategy I'm thinking of.

779
00:50:56,802 --> 00:50:57,023
Speaker 0: right.

780
00:50:57,405 --> 00:50:58,749
Speaker 0: Let's say per chance.

781
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:00,074
Speaker 0: You didn't have enough food.

782
00:51:00,134 --> 00:51:01,580
Speaker 0: Maybe you had some food, but not enough.

783
00:51:02,322 --> 00:51:03,966
Speaker 0: There was a move you could make.

784
00:51:04,006 --> 00:51:04,688
Speaker 0: you could write.

785
00:51:04,748 --> 00:51:13,339
Speaker 0: someone else in the game needs one particular action to get enough food instead of feeding yourself with another action.

786
00:51:13,983 --> 00:51:25,788
Speaker 0: Instead block them and forcing both of you to beg right and or maybe multiple players to beg and in that way the begging didn't matter because Everyone begged.

787
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:31,800
Speaker 1: Yes, that is definitely a strategy But I feel like the situation would have to like arise perfectly.

788
00:51:32,042 --> 00:51:34,400
Speaker 0: I feel like moons would have to line up in a straight row.

789
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:38,340
Speaker 1: I get the impression that if you ever beg you've done fucked.

790
00:51:38,601 --> 00:51:48,200
Speaker 1: I also I get the impression that if you beg you fucked up, of course I did pull a somewhat fantastic coup against Scott and Alex the most recent.

791
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:48,481
Speaker 1: well,

792
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:50,652
Speaker 0: you forgot you had the car that lets you eat wood,

793
00:51:50,893 --> 00:52:14,560
Speaker 1: but simultaneously I basically pointed out that I could not win the game and I had a lot of Math to back me up by not pointing out the card I had that let my people eat wood because they both also forgot about it despite the fact that I made a big deal about it way in the beginning of the game and I basically convinced them both that I had lost the game totally and there was no way I could win And I was like I shouldn't even play anymore.

794
00:52:14,861 --> 00:52:16,469
Speaker 1: Let's just get this game done with go go go.

795
00:52:17,153 --> 00:52:19,884
Speaker 1: and then they ignored me the rest of the game And then I won by one point.

796
00:52:20,125 --> 00:52:21,890
Speaker 0: Well, we were ignore you.

797
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:23,435
Speaker 0: we were just be all he did.

798
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:26,001
Speaker 0: really it didn't change my game strategically.

799
00:52:26,282 --> 00:52:28,610
Speaker 0: what he changed was basically we were.

800
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:40,226
Speaker 0: it realized there is a flaw in the game and that if Let's say Rin didn't have that card He was in a position Where he fucked up and there's no way he could win because he would been forced to beg and it was close to the end Of the game and he couldn't have won.

801
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,292
Speaker 1: Yes, there's that.

802
00:52:41,453 --> 00:52:44,749
Speaker 0: if that situation arises Why should he keep playing?

803
00:52:45,151 --> 00:52:47,000
Speaker 0: and that's frustrating for the other players?

804
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,420
Speaker 0: Cuz it's like well if I was in his shoes, I agree.

805
00:52:49,821 --> 00:52:50,926
Speaker 0: Why should I keep playing?

806
00:52:50,966 --> 00:52:54,219
Speaker 0: I can't win but being one of the other players who can win.

807
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:59,700
Speaker 0: Now my game is ruined if he decides to stop playing because now I'm not gonna find out who wins.

808
00:53:00,041 --> 00:53:00,824
Speaker 0: Cuz the game's over.

809
00:53:01,005 --> 00:53:12,707
Speaker 1: some games deal with this very elegantly in that you still like railroad tycoon Even if you can't win if the game is fun enough and you can accomplish enough in your turn To where the end of the game is enjoyable.

810
00:53:12,827 --> 00:53:16,678
Speaker 0: other games have rules that are awesome like quitting without fucking up the game.

811
00:53:16,758 --> 00:53:19,285
Speaker 1: do this Yep, or age of steam.

812
00:53:19,525 --> 00:53:20,287
Speaker 1: Well, you fucked up.

813
00:53:20,548 --> 00:53:21,992
Speaker 1: You're done out of the game.

814
00:53:22,012 --> 00:53:24,799
Speaker 1: You're out bankrupt zero leave.

815
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:26,969
Speaker 1: Yep But this game.

816
00:53:26,989 --> 00:53:34,720
Speaker 1: I can foresee Players getting into that situation and there's especially bad players against good players.

817
00:53:35,042 --> 00:53:41,876
Speaker 0: It's gonna easily happen where they get in a situation where it's obvious They cannot win no matter what even if they were allowed to do whatever they wanted to.

818
00:53:42,017 --> 00:53:42,379
Speaker 1: there's no.

819
00:53:42,399 --> 00:53:45,419
Speaker 1: I mean I can think of a few hackish ways out, but there's no elegant way out.

820
00:53:45,862 --> 00:53:48,459
Speaker 0: No, unless you have like miracle cards in your hand or something.

821
00:53:48,911 --> 00:53:51,548
Speaker 1: Yeah That's one of the biggest failings of the game.

822
00:53:51,569 --> 00:54:10,291
Speaker 1: that and the fact that it worries me how powerful an extra child is and the fact that Basically One player in a three-player game It is very easy for one player to be denied an extra child For so long that it might be impossible for them to win.

823
00:54:10,311 --> 00:54:18,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much you can just keep you know Depending on the card that comes up that lets you make babies comes up someone immediately gets on it.

824
00:54:18,961 --> 00:54:21,159
Speaker 0: Okay, the next round no one else can get on it, right?

825
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:23,629
Speaker 0: So that person has a baby before everyone else.

826
00:54:24,091 --> 00:54:31,340
Speaker 0: the next round they use their baby Someone else immediately jumps on and gets the second baby or the same person does it or see?

827
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:34,009
Speaker 1: I think the problem is in a two-player game.

828
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:35,615
Speaker 1: is he is kind of even out.

829
00:54:36,177 --> 00:54:41,915
Speaker 1: in a four-player game More likely one person gets a little boost instead of one person getting kicked down.

830
00:54:42,236 --> 00:54:53,641
Speaker 1: Yeah in three-player I feel like there's this specific condition Whereby a player can be marginalized Completely out of the game through no fault of their third person doesn't get the baby Right.

831
00:54:53,681 --> 00:55:01,648
Speaker 0: the third person to get the baby is sort of way down there because this harvest comes before and then There's sort of a step behind everyone.

832
00:55:01,668 --> 00:55:04,540
Speaker 1: now this happened to me, but I saved it.

833
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:08,153
Speaker 1: I salvaged it, but I could foresee a situation where it's on.

834
00:55:08,173 --> 00:55:14,300
Speaker 1: so don't have the wood eating card Yes, but even if I didn't have the wood eating card of course my whole strategy would have been different.

835
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:21,080
Speaker 1: But still there remains that there could be situations whereby you could lose a game through no fault of your own.

836
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,388
Speaker 1: But I'm not sure yet.

837
00:55:22,408 --> 00:55:24,460
Speaker 1: hmm the game needs a lot more play.

838
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:27,635
Speaker 0: It does it does, but that's the one thing it hasn't gotten bored.

839
00:55:27,675 --> 00:55:28,720
Speaker 0: yet another thing about this game.

840
00:55:28,781 --> 00:55:35,580
Speaker 0: Right is a lot of times I'll play games that have like where you put a lot of cards out in front of you right even something like magic the gathering.

841
00:55:35,721 --> 00:55:35,921
Speaker 0: Right.

842
00:55:36,263 --> 00:55:41,626
Speaker 0: you put a bunch of cards out that have like permanent effects, and I'll always be like ah shit I forgot about this card.

843
00:55:41,686 --> 00:55:42,994
Speaker 0: I had I didn't do what it said.

844
00:55:43,074 --> 00:55:43,738
Speaker 0: crap you know.

845
00:55:44,241 --> 00:55:46,538
Speaker 0: I can try to remember what game that happens to me in a lot.

846
00:55:47,482 --> 00:55:53,930
Speaker 0: I can't think of one right now, but it's always like you play special powers in front of you and then later It's like oh, I forgot to use this even though.

847
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:54,734
Speaker 0: I had it crap.

848
00:55:54,996 --> 00:55:59,000
Speaker 1: well in La Chita I remember a number of times all of us would forget to count one of our cities.

849
00:55:59,121 --> 00:56:01,557
Speaker 0: But yeah stuff like that, but that game's just hard to score.

850
00:56:01,597 --> 00:56:04,756
Speaker 0: like you know I'll have a card in front of me that says take an extra victory point.

851
00:56:04,856 --> 00:56:09,719
Speaker 0: if this happens Then that will happen like three times, and I'll be like oh, I forgot to take the extra victory point.

852
00:56:09,759 --> 00:56:14,136
Speaker 0: shit You know I could have had three points, but now I forgot crap in a Greek Allah.

853
00:56:14,197 --> 00:56:15,060
Speaker 0: That doesn't really happen.

854
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,586
Speaker 0: I seem to remember every card.

855
00:56:16,627 --> 00:56:23,020
Speaker 0: I have in front of me and use them all at every appropriate opportunity Which is I don't know what about something about the design of the game?

856
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:30,689
Speaker 0: You know what it is me from forgetting the cards and whatever it is I don't know what it is is good The game is so there's so little actually going on.

857
00:56:30,729 --> 00:56:39,392
Speaker 1: the decisions you make as complex and horrible as they are to make are Simple to enact and are limited in number on an absolute scale.

858
00:56:39,472 --> 00:56:48,996
Speaker 1: so the kids you'll spend most of your time Reading all your cards over and over again and forming very complex strategies and very complex like.

859
00:56:49,317 --> 00:56:56,379
Speaker 1: I'll do this on turn two So that in turn five because he won't need this and he won't need this I'll be able to take this action, and then this action

860
00:56:56,793 --> 00:57:04,321
Speaker 0: Yeah I think also part of it though with the cards is sort of like San Juan where San Juan has all these cards and you look at them You're like man.

861
00:57:04,362 --> 00:57:11,607
Speaker 0: if I can get the well and the steeple and the something else then I could get like a bajillion Resources with like one play.

862
00:57:12,048 --> 00:57:16,565
Speaker 0: the thing is you're better off just getting a whole bunch of silver mines Right?

863
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:18,120
Speaker 0: so I feel like in Agricola.

864
00:57:18,241 --> 00:57:25,316
Speaker 0: Maybe you're better off just getting a whole bunch of big Obvious like major improvements and forgetting all the little cards that add up and combo together.

865
00:57:25,356 --> 00:57:27,807
Speaker 1: because well don't combo That's the thing you can't combo.

866
00:57:27,847 --> 00:57:30,320
Speaker 1: you can't expect to play all these things at the same time.

867
00:57:30,704 --> 00:57:31,879
Speaker 1: You just have to have a strategy.

868
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:45,574
Speaker 1: And I think the reason we don't forget to use cards is that cards not only have a very specific purpose But the cost of playing a card is Enormous, so if you play a card you had a fucking good reason to play it And you're not gonna forget about.

869
00:57:45,614 --> 00:57:46,060
Speaker 0: yeah, you're gonna.

870
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:49,275
Speaker 0: You know when you play a card you're gonna use it at least twice.

871
00:57:49,375 --> 00:57:53,068
Speaker 0: otherwise that was stupid Because you wasted a whole action.

872
00:57:53,189 --> 00:58:03,487
Speaker 0: if you're only gonna use it once you probably could have just did a different action and got an Equivalent you know effect for it, but uh in I guess in conclusion This game is fantastic.

873
00:58:03,527 --> 00:58:04,332
Speaker 1: if you're a board game fan.

874
00:58:04,352 --> 00:58:04,855
Speaker 1: Just buy it.

875
00:58:04,895 --> 00:58:05,599
Speaker 1: don't even worry about.

876
00:58:05,639 --> 00:58:07,719
Speaker 0: yeah This is pretty much the game right now.

877
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:08,623
Speaker 0: It's very it's.

878
00:58:08,764 --> 00:58:12,680
Speaker 0: it's got a lot of things in common with a lot of other games like Kayla's and things like that.

879
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:25,051
Speaker 0: But it's different enough from other games and it combines elements from many different games that it is something unique that stands alone and Even if it's eventually solved it has a lot of replay value.

880
00:58:25,131 --> 00:58:30,952
Speaker 0: and for most people who aren't as crazy as us about solving games You'll probably be entertained by this like times a hajillion.

881
00:58:31,273 --> 00:58:32,559
Speaker 1: and also you know crazy at us.

882
00:58:33,422 --> 00:58:37,678
Speaker 1: You know we always laugh like yeah settlers of Catan is a completely worthless game if you've solved it.

883
00:58:38,562 --> 00:58:40,290
Speaker 1: It took us years to solve it

884
00:58:40,571 --> 00:58:50,421
Speaker 0: and the vast majority of people will never solve it and they will always find settlers of Catan to be awesome and That vast majority of people will find Agricola to be awesome forever probably But

885
00:58:50,701 --> 00:58:57,320
Speaker 1: I guess not to sound like we're conceited about that the only reason we solve games like settlers or three-player boarders.

886
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,244
Speaker 1: We're crazy.

887
00:58:58,264 --> 00:58:58,947
Speaker 1: We play them.

888
00:58:58,987 --> 00:58:59,991
Speaker 0: We play them too much.

889
00:59:00,272 --> 00:59:02,120
Speaker 0: most people play them like once in a blue moon.

890
00:59:02,441 --> 00:59:05,088
Speaker 1: We would play settlers every day in college.

891
00:59:05,289 --> 00:59:09,159
Speaker 1: We would play Puerto Rico like three or four times a day over the summer.

892
00:59:09,259 --> 00:59:11,925
Speaker 1: Yep It's crazy.

893
00:59:11,945 --> 00:59:15,140
Speaker 0: people mostly will be happy to play settlers once a week or once a month.

894
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:23,196
Speaker 1: Yeah And I mean I guess the number of times we played it Makes sense if you don't say if you play a game that many times you haven't solved it something's wrong.

895
00:59:23,476 --> 00:59:25,148
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right I think we're done.

896
00:59:25,168 --> 00:59:25,857
