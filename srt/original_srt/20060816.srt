1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,420
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday August 16th, and this is geek nights.

2
00:00:13,227 --> 00:00:15,236
Speaker 1: tonight it's Otakon.

3
00:00:16,881 --> 00:00:17,916
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:19,362 --> 00:00:23,560
Speaker 0: Well tonight is very special geek nights because tonight is Otakon.

5
00:00:24,161 --> 00:00:24,703
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

6
00:00:24,803 --> 00:00:26,448
Speaker 1: Otakon was two weekends ago.

7
00:00:26,748 --> 00:00:26,929
Speaker 0: Well.

8
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:29,315
Speaker 0: We're going to go back in time and relive Otakon 2006.

9
00:00:29,315 --> 00:00:29,636
Speaker 0: Holy crap.

10
00:00:31,641 --> 00:00:33,392
Speaker 0: Well, we're not crammed to an elevator with.

11
00:00:33,432 --> 00:00:34,580
Speaker 0: you're going to Otakon I assume.

12
00:00:36,407 --> 00:00:37,660
Speaker 2: So have you ever been to Otakon before?

13
00:00:41,035 --> 00:00:41,783
Speaker 0: also One.

14
00:00:41,883 --> 00:00:45,760
Speaker 0: you might notice as you may have noticed all week that I sound slightly different from usual.

15
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:48,220
Speaker 0: It is again because I do not have a pop filter.

16
00:00:48,662 --> 00:00:51,820
Speaker 0: Someone stole it or more likely I lost it at Otakon.

17
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,124
Speaker 1: Well, how much did it cost?

18
00:00:53,525 --> 00:00:57,920
Speaker 0: it cost five cents plus one fifth of a pair of two dollar pantyhose?

19
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,522
Speaker 1: That's not much.

20
00:01:00,124 --> 00:01:04,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I got to go out and get a new pantyhose and a new embroidery loop.

21
00:01:05,384 --> 00:01:08,767
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll just buy some Pop filters are like 20 bucks.

22
00:01:08,908 --> 00:01:09,892
Speaker 0: I am making a new one.

23
00:01:10,072 --> 00:01:11,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, maybe that's a good idea.

24
00:01:12,523 --> 00:01:16,299
Speaker 0: Yeah, unless a microphone I get that's good comes with one that would be good anyway.

25
00:01:16,339 --> 00:01:23,589
Speaker 0: now I said it's a special geek nights partly because we're going to break from tradition a bit and tonight We're just going to talk about Otakon.

26
00:01:23,669 --> 00:01:24,232
Speaker 0: No news.

27
00:01:24,675 --> 00:01:25,640
Speaker 0: No things of the day.

28
00:01:26,222 --> 00:01:33,539
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter because all the things of the day I have in waiting are video game related Yes, and all my news is crap.

29
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,343
Speaker 1: There's no good news.

30
00:01:34,383 --> 00:01:38,459
Speaker 0: and also you can basically consider everything we say today to be a thing of the day.

31
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:45,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if you really want some anime news, I mean I was probably just gonna read something from anime news network.

32
00:01:45,322 --> 00:01:49,127
Speaker 1: So just just go read that website And you'll be okay.

33
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:55,940
Speaker 0: Yeah now don't be worried starting tomorrow We're gonna go right back to the usual schedule with the news the things of the day the meta bits all that stuff.

34
00:01:56,603 --> 00:02:10,049
Speaker 0: we're doing this partly because Otakon episodes tend to be long and - because many times a lot of the people who were listening to this episode will only listen to this episode because a lot of people from Otakon are probably listening right now.

35
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:17,431
Speaker 1: Yeah, and also it takes a long time to sum up four days of activities into Less than two hours, hopefully.

36
00:02:17,853 --> 00:02:19,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see if we even finish this.

37
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,092
Speaker 1: Yeah, if we add news and things of the day, it's gonna be even longer.

38
00:02:22,212 --> 00:02:30,194
Speaker 0: So let's get right into it Yep, so without further ado we left for Otakon 2006 at what 7/8 in the morning.

39
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:32,943
Speaker 1: That's about right.

40
00:02:32,963 --> 00:02:34,147
Speaker 0: Yeah every year.

41
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:35,872
Speaker 0: We try to get there by noon on Thursday.

42
00:02:36,474 --> 00:02:38,019
Speaker 0: It's basically a four-day event for us.

43
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:49,400
Speaker 1: and Well, it was pretty good drive except for the fact that there were four people in my car Which is fine for people can fit in my car, but it was myself or people's worth of luggage does not fit in my car.

44
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:54,277
Speaker 1: Well, it mostly fit mostly fit, but I couldn't see that well out the back window.

45
00:02:54,397 --> 00:02:54,678
Speaker 1: Yeah.

46
00:02:54,718 --> 00:02:55,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

47
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,472
Speaker 0: I once drive drove like 800 miles with my car so full of stuff.

48
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:02,100
Speaker 0: I couldn't even see out the right side of my windshield.

49
00:03:03,361 --> 00:03:05,459
Speaker 0: Wow, yeah, it was really awesome.

50
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:08,230
Speaker 0: Anyway, my house and my me not so much.

51
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,080
Speaker 1: There were a lot of cops on the road.

52
00:03:10,461 --> 00:03:11,645
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think there were more cops.

53
00:03:11,665 --> 00:03:15,840
Speaker 0: However in Delaware the state we were in the least than it all the other states combined.

54
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,498
Speaker 1: Well, actually we were in percentage of the state.

55
00:03:20,302 --> 00:03:22,093
Speaker 1: We were in most of Delaware.

56
00:03:22,294 --> 00:03:28,255
Speaker 0: as far as I can tell Every single police officer in the state of Delaware was on the road.

57
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,060
Speaker 0: We were on trying to pull us over.

58
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,680
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, I 95, you know, it's like you get a million.

59
00:03:32,841 --> 00:03:40,056
Speaker 1: No one's like 90% of the people driving through Delaware on I-95 are not stopping in Delaware unless they want to buy something that 0% sales tax.

60
00:03:40,116 --> 00:03:44,028
Speaker 1: and You know, they're from another state.

61
00:03:44,068 --> 00:03:44,911
Speaker 1: That is not Delaware.

62
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:46,959
Speaker 0: Therefore Delaware wants money.

63
00:03:47,341 --> 00:03:55,999
Speaker 1: it's basically a bunch of cops lined up in Delaware ready to steal money from the other states and Jersey and Maryland were not light on police activity either.

64
00:03:56,292 --> 00:04:04,495
Speaker 0: Yeah In fact Baltimore has bit by bit been getting worse in this that there are pretty much red light cameras at almost every major intersection in the Inner Harbor.

65
00:04:04,515 --> 00:04:07,580
Speaker 1: now Don't run red lights in Baltimore.

66
00:04:07,812 --> 00:04:07,918
Speaker 0: Yeah.

67
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:14,214
Speaker 0: And when I say don't run red lights I mean don't run green lights because the lights basically go green green green green green yellow red.

68
00:04:14,956 --> 00:04:16,099
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and there's.

69
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:20,779
Speaker 0: no It's such a scam but that is a topic for another day.

70
00:04:21,582 --> 00:04:25,793
Speaker 1: We got to Otacon without incident and we parked the car.

71
00:04:26,194 --> 00:04:28,300
Speaker 2: Katsu has finally joined the front row crew.

72
00:04:28,562 --> 00:04:29,979
Speaker 2: How long did it take you to get here?

73
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,623
Speaker 2: Several hours.

74
00:04:31,723 --> 00:04:33,771
Speaker 2: I got held up because of traffic accidents.

75
00:04:33,952 --> 00:04:35,136
Speaker 0: Did you kill anyone?

76
00:04:35,156 --> 00:04:37,068
Speaker 2: No Do you plan to?

77
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:44,185
Speaker 0: Maybe Yep, and now they're.

78
00:04:44,426 --> 00:04:50,223
Speaker 0: the options in parking are basically park expensively at our hotel or park cheaply a block away And you know what?

79
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:51,993
Speaker 0: We're lazy and we have money.

80
00:04:52,053 --> 00:04:53,180
Speaker 0: So we parked at the hotel.

81
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:58,857
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's weird because theoretically if you read the sign my understanding is that the park at the hotel is $21 a day.

82
00:05:00,062 --> 00:05:01,200
Speaker 1: Isn't that the way you read the sign?

83
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:12,580
Speaker 1: In fact, that is exactly what the sign says and I think a year or two year last a year ago at Otacon 2005 We scammed them by forgetting the ticket and we paid like 20 bucks.

84
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:16,934
Speaker 0: Well, the guy said 20 bucks and I said, okay, and then he let us go.

85
00:05:16,954 --> 00:05:21,310
Speaker 1: Yep this year I handed them the ticket because we were just so tired.

86
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,695
Speaker 1: We didn't even want to try the scam.

87
00:05:22,776 --> 00:05:23,860
Speaker 0: Also, we couldn't talk.

88
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,240
Speaker 0: There's no way we could scam people when we couldn't talk exactly.

89
00:05:27,381 --> 00:05:28,766
Speaker 0: So literally we couldn't talk.

90
00:05:28,806 --> 00:05:34,550
Speaker 0: the only person in the car who could actually speak was Yuko And she was not about to help us scam someone.

91
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:40,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, I handed him the ticket and they asked for $21 and the ticket said I was there since Thursday.

92
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:49,265
Speaker 0: so hey now it's not just that we're misreading all the policies or signs because two years ago and Three years ago.

93
00:05:49,706 --> 00:05:52,294
Speaker 0: We paid quite a bit of money to park there.

94
00:05:52,494 --> 00:05:53,477
Speaker 1: Yes, we did.

95
00:05:53,517 --> 00:05:54,360
Speaker 1: It was a lot of money.

96
00:05:54,561 --> 00:06:00,380
Speaker 0: So I'm not sure exactly what's going on But you know what park at your hotel's parking lot if you stay in the Renaissance.

97
00:06:00,762 --> 00:06:04,720
Speaker 1: Yes parking under the Renaissance is a good place to park and it's a nice lot.

98
00:06:05,102 --> 00:06:13,893
Speaker 1: I mean if you go to the very bottom level of the lot There's a bunch of spaces and you're pretty close to an elevator and there's some guys down there who wash your car if you pay Them which is cool.

99
00:06:14,055 --> 00:06:17,187
Speaker 0: Yeah All right, yeah, so then, you know, we hung out.

100
00:06:17,328 --> 00:06:21,160
Speaker 0: eventually the entire front row crew gathered and we had a little pool party.

101
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:22,045
Speaker 0: Yeah, we had.

102
00:06:22,105 --> 00:06:24,659
Speaker 0: in fact we took over the entire pool.

103
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:25,119
Speaker 0: Yeah

104
00:06:25,564 --> 00:06:38,020
Speaker 1: The worst part was that we wanted to use the hot tub But we couldn't use it as much as last year because if too many people get into the hot tub The water is displaced and it covers the air intakes with water and then the jet stop working.

105
00:06:38,322 --> 00:06:40,720
Speaker 0: Pete alone could pretty much make the jet stop working.

106
00:06:41,161 --> 00:06:46,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, so not too many people could go in there and a lot of non front row crew people were in there.

107
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,757
Speaker 0: So, however, there were more front row crew people than other kinds of people in the pool that night.

108
00:06:51,817 --> 00:06:52,560
Speaker 1: That is correct.

109
00:06:52,761 --> 00:06:57,694
Speaker 0: We were one massive massive nest of people who can't see without their glasses

110
00:06:57,734 --> 00:07:00,769
Speaker 1: and there weren't a bunch of screaming kids in there So that God

111
00:07:01,011 --> 00:07:01,496
Speaker 0: last year

112
00:07:03,902 --> 00:07:08,520
Speaker 1: And of course I have it but right before the pool party we were in line to get badges

113
00:07:09,122 --> 00:07:09,384
Speaker 0: Which

114
00:07:09,564 --> 00:07:11,493
Speaker 1: we do need because they are not stinking

115
00:07:11,935 --> 00:07:12,056
Speaker 0: now.

116
00:07:12,156 --> 00:07:15,447
Speaker 0: before we go any further I would like to note that throughout this episode.

117
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:28,600
Speaker 0: I'm going to be tossing in relevant interviews and audio from the convention Coolness, but anyway on Thursday the temperature in Baltimore with the heat index was what a hundred and five.

118
00:07:28,921 --> 00:07:31,731
Speaker 1: It was officially too damn hot degrees out.

119
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:32,473
Speaker 0: Good.

120
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:35,864
Speaker 0: God was it hot now despite this woman It is motherfucking hot.

121
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:47,171
Speaker 0: despite this not only did people wait in line since some god-awful hour But there were people Cosplaying in the Sun in line.

122
00:07:47,231 --> 00:07:49,640
Speaker 1: There were not many but they were there.

123
00:07:50,861 --> 00:07:57,460
Speaker 0: I'm here in the hundred degree plus weather outside of Otacon for people trying to get in for their pre-registration on Thursday.

124
00:07:57,681 --> 00:07:59,567
Speaker 2: Now, what is your name Lindsey Kieffer?

125
00:07:59,989 --> 00:08:00,812
Speaker 2: And who are you dressed up?

126
00:08:00,972 --> 00:08:06,050
Speaker 2: as actually this is part of my costume I'm actually gonna go as a Shinsengumi member.

127
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:12,083
Speaker 0: Oh now Shinsengumi from any particular anime or just the idea from Veroni Kenshin Beautiful.

128
00:08:12,123 --> 00:08:16,255
Speaker 2: now you're wearing right now a full heavy looking black outfit.

129
00:08:16,657 --> 00:08:17,700
Speaker 2: Is it actually that heavy?

130
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:18,943
Speaker 2: No, not really.

131
00:08:19,023 --> 00:08:20,510
Speaker 2: Actually, the sleeves are pretty airy.

132
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,680
Speaker 2: So so how you make it out in this heat?

133
00:08:23,401 --> 00:08:27,639
Speaker 2: I'm actually doing surprisingly well, but it wouldn't hurt to have a water bottle right now.

134
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:29,866
Speaker 0: So is your first Otacon?

135
00:08:30,227 --> 00:08:33,479
Speaker 2: No, actually I've been here several times before coming for my fifth year now.

136
00:08:34,241 --> 00:08:38,259
Speaker 0: So we're here in the pre-reg line for Otacon Thursday night.

Speaker 0: Well, what do you think the temperature is right now?

141
00:08:46,348 --> 00:08:50,821
Speaker 2: Oh, I'd say it's about 95 97.

142
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:51,584
Speaker 2: How are you doing this?

143
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:52,306
Speaker 2: I would die.

144
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:53,630
Speaker 0: I'm dying now and I'm wearing shorts.

145
00:08:54,313 --> 00:08:56,440
Speaker 2: Oh the the mask makes it very hot.

146
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,391
Speaker 2: I must say, um, I noticed the mask is not on right now.

147
00:08:59,411 --> 00:09:05,939
Speaker 2: No, uh, I Was walking down the entire line with it on and I was just sweating the entire time.

148
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:09,753
Speaker 2: So you're aware how long the line is in front of you, right?

149
00:09:09,914 --> 00:09:10,317
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.

150
00:09:10,558 --> 00:09:12,385
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah How long have you been here in line?

151
00:09:12,946 --> 00:09:14,852
Speaker 0: Um, about 20 25 minutes.

152
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:16,096
Speaker 2: That's not bad at all.

153
00:09:16,638 --> 00:09:18,182
Speaker 2: No, not really All right.

154
00:09:18,222 --> 00:09:19,086
Speaker 2: So then one last question.

155
00:09:19,107 --> 00:09:19,950
Speaker 0: This is your first Otacon.

156
00:09:19,971 --> 00:09:20,734
Speaker 0: You've been here before?

157
00:09:20,754 --> 00:09:26,732
Speaker 2: I was here last year Actually, so you think it's gonna be better worse I can't tell right now.

158
00:09:28,075 --> 00:09:29,319
Speaker 2: be warmer at least yeah.

159
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,980
Speaker 0: Now luckily Otacon did something very nice that the line was very long and there were a lot of people there.

160
00:09:37,522 --> 00:09:47,880
Speaker 0: So well before they were scheduled to let people in to get registrations They opened the doors and brought much of the line into the well Not much because the line was massive but as many people as they could into the air conditioning.

161
00:09:48,141 --> 00:09:57,967
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean there were some people there who waited since like the crack-ass crack of dawn and way earlier than they possibly needed To wait which is kind of sad.

162
00:09:58,008 --> 00:09:59,372
Speaker 1: because when did we get in the line?

163
00:09:59,413 --> 00:10:01,339
Speaker 1: I mean the line was open at five, right?

164
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,065
Speaker 0: Yep, we was five to nine.

165
00:10:03,085 --> 00:10:06,700
Speaker 0: We waited till about quarter after six and by then the line was moving steadily.

166
00:10:06,861 --> 00:10:14,456
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean a quarter after six we got in the line and we were physically Like maybe I don't know a football field from the door.

167
00:10:14,778 --> 00:10:22,293
Speaker 1: Yeah, barely Yeah, and you know the line just moved so fast that you know within I'd say less than a half hour.

168
00:10:22,353 --> 00:10:23,140
Speaker 1: We had our badges.

169
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,667
Speaker 1: So the people who get and wait in that Thursday line way at the front.

170
00:10:27,968 --> 00:10:28,689
Speaker 1: What are you thinking?

171
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:35,300
Speaker 0: I mean Seriously, I'm here with two lovely ladies who have just gotten their free registrations.

172
00:10:35,481 --> 00:10:37,819
Speaker 2: Now, how long did you have to stand in line to get it this early?

173
00:10:38,302 --> 00:10:39,468
Speaker 2: Forever okay.

174
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,600
Speaker 2: I got here like two and she was here.

175
00:10:43,363 --> 00:10:45,129
Speaker 0: Did you get in line at two or did you?

176
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,157
Speaker 2: yeah, I got in line around ten o'clock.

177
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:52,851
Speaker 0: Wow Were there people already in line?

178
00:10:52,871 --> 00:10:55,962
Speaker 2: when you got here there weren't too many There weren't?

179
00:10:55,982 --> 00:10:57,808
Speaker 2: you miss means there were people in line.

180
00:10:57,828 --> 00:11:04,769
Speaker 2: people in line the person the first person got in around Three or five a.m I think so.

181
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,134
Speaker 2: Are you dealing with the weather?

182
00:11:06,194 --> 00:11:07,358
Speaker 2: It's a little warm.

183
00:11:07,398 --> 00:11:07,900
Speaker 0: I've noticed.

184
00:11:08,422 --> 00:11:15,160
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had to send up set up like a 10th or outside the convention center Just to keep us from the heat while we're waiting.

185
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:22,920
Speaker 2: It's pretty bad like umbrellas and like sheet tape to a wall and like chairs and like just create shade.

186
00:11:23,402 --> 00:11:25,514
Speaker 0: So is this your first old account or you've been to him before?

187
00:11:25,534 --> 00:11:26,500
Speaker 2: this would be my fourth year?

188
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,386
Speaker 0: Excellent.

189
00:11:28,407 --> 00:11:36,264
Speaker 2: This is I'm not sure I can't I Fantastic.

190
00:11:36,284 --> 00:11:37,089
Speaker 0: So here's a question.

191
00:11:37,109 --> 00:11:38,496
Speaker 0: What do you think about the musical act?

192
00:11:38,516 --> 00:11:39,220
Speaker 0: They're gonna have this year.

193
00:11:40,621 --> 00:11:44,678
Speaker 2: I'm excited, but I was a little disappointed that they're holding it so far off-site.

194
00:11:45,543 --> 00:11:47,680
Speaker 0: But at the same token, it's an actual concert arena.

195
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:58,706
Speaker 2: They were able to bring them in but I don't like the way Otakon is handling the concert situation The fact that I cosplay.

196
00:11:58,726 --> 00:12:01,339
Speaker 2: I don't want to keep on changing in and out of costumes to go there.

197
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:03,288
Speaker 2: True in the morning.

198
00:12:07,581 --> 00:12:12,099
Speaker 0: I mean if you really like them, it's worth it, but I don't like them enough to do that.

199
00:12:14,021 --> 00:12:17,632
Speaker 0: So are you guys going to be cosplaying this weekend, what are you cosplaying as?

200
00:12:17,652 --> 00:12:24,360
Speaker 0: very briefly if you'll go from digi-chart Anytime from the OS town girls, but yes, we avoided all that.

201
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,598
Speaker 0: I mean we brought our DS's didn't even really have a chance to play them in the line.

202
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:28,742
Speaker 1: Nope Not at all.

203
00:12:29,404 --> 00:12:34,280
Speaker 1: In fact, the only things we did in the line were enjoy the cosplays that went running by like Little Mac.

204
00:12:35,062 --> 00:12:35,864
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

205
00:12:36,165 --> 00:12:36,446
Speaker 0: Yes.

206
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,672
Speaker 0: That was one of the best cosplays I've ever seen.

207
00:12:38,953 --> 00:12:41,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think there's pictures of it on the flicker.

208
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was a guy dressed exactly like Little Mac from Mike Tyson's punch-out.

209
00:12:45,192 --> 00:12:48,432
Speaker 0: Yeah Now when I say exactly I mean exactly.

210
00:12:48,472 --> 00:12:50,440
Speaker 0: he had a pixel face over his face.

211
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:58,415
Speaker 0: That was so well done and well positioned that if you zoom in on a picture of him No matter how far you zoom in it just looks exactly like Little Mac.

212
00:12:58,576 --> 00:13:03,739
Speaker 1: Yep, it Is perfect and there was a guy running behind in front of him with.

213
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:17,279
Speaker 1: you know The bicycle or I think I had a scooter instead of a bicycle, but he had a little boombox playing Yep, and it was so cool.

214
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:21,346
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're not.

215
00:13:21,386 --> 00:13:28,636
Speaker 0: we're gonna mention the cosplays we saw off and on but Rest assured there were many many many amazing cosplays.

216
00:13:28,656 --> 00:13:32,451
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Alright, I'm here with the dude dressed up as dr.

Speaker 2: you read the comic.

220
00:13:35,141 --> 00:13:36,164
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, I have now.

221
00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:40,620
Speaker 2: When did you decide to do this cosplay when I found that I had a lab coat in my closet?

222
00:13:41,122 --> 00:13:42,085
Speaker 0: How long you been reading?

223
00:13:42,165 --> 00:13:42,466
Speaker 0: Dr.

224
00:13:42,486 --> 00:13:45,134
Speaker 2: McNinja Oh for like for about five months now.

225
00:13:45,255 --> 00:13:46,659
Speaker 2: It's like how long it's been out.

226
00:13:47,121 --> 00:13:48,125
Speaker 1: I know there any other webcomics.

227
00:13:48,146 --> 00:13:48,367
Speaker 0: You're it.

228
00:13:48,387 --> 00:13:48,929
Speaker 0: I'm just curious.

229
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:49,452
Speaker 0: Excuse me.

230
00:13:49,512 --> 00:13:51,060
Speaker 0: Do you want other webcomics to read?

231
00:13:51,381 --> 00:13:54,836
Speaker 2: Oh eg cats penny arcade Perry Bible's fellowship.

232
00:13:55,478 --> 00:14:01,904
Speaker 2: Yes This comic sucks In 8-bit theater.

233
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:03,910
Speaker 0: All right, so I guess one question.

234
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,034
Speaker 0: How's Otacon going this year?

235
00:14:05,154 --> 00:14:07,060
Speaker 0: I mean your cosplay now, it's hot outside.

236
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:08,785
Speaker 0: How's the con going?

237
00:14:08,845 --> 00:14:10,513
Speaker 2: It's not pretty good so far.

238
00:14:10,533 --> 00:14:13,022
Speaker 2: This is actually my first time at Otacon Really?

239
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,109
Speaker 0: Have you been to the dealer's room yet?

240
00:14:15,511 --> 00:14:17,799
Speaker 2: I saw the line back there and I'm not trying to go on that line.

241
00:14:19,043 --> 00:14:20,368
Speaker 2: Any idea how big it is.

242
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:23,900
Speaker 2: I seem on a brochure and like yeah, that's it.

243
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:27,859
Speaker 0: So if this is your first I would've got is this your first anime con or no?

244
00:14:28,282 --> 00:14:30,996
Speaker 2: I've been to the big Apple anime fest which kind of closed down before.

245
00:14:31,016 --> 00:14:35,460
Speaker 0: Yeah What was the first anime you ever saw that you knew was anime?

246
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,484
Speaker 2: That's gonna have to be Akira.

247
00:14:38,106 --> 00:14:38,408
Speaker 0: All right.

248
00:14:38,468 --> 00:14:40,456
Speaker 0: What was the first anime ever ever?

249
00:14:42,657 --> 00:14:51,077
Speaker 2: Of Ever would probably be a cure also Like the first one ever made first one ever made Check gets work.

250
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:53,774
Speaker 2: It's a better guess than some people have had.

251
00:14:53,835 --> 00:14:56,347
Speaker 1: Yeah All right, so that was Thursday.

252
00:14:56,368 --> 00:14:59,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, Thursday was mostly a front row crew pool party.

253
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:05,577
Speaker 1: It was a pool party and it was a nighttime party and it was a line to get badges.

254
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:06,460
Speaker 1: No the badges.

255
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:12,160
Speaker 1: Usually at Otacon, you know, they have a whole bunch of different badges to choose from with art from different anime.

256
00:15:12,461 --> 00:15:21,566
Speaker 1: And you know usually, you know, there's a cute one and there's a girly one and a Gundam one robot one An almost yaoi one.

257
00:15:21,626 --> 00:15:27,447
Speaker 1: Yeah, and usually they have to do with newer shows and popular shows of the time You know and sometimes an obscure show.

258
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:30,699
Speaker 1: this year the selection for badges was ass.

259
00:15:32,022 --> 00:15:35,480
Speaker 0: I mean, I am NOT one to complain about Otacon.

260
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:40,053
Speaker 0: I consider Otacon to be the greatest anime convention I've ever been to.

261
00:15:40,755 --> 00:15:42,560
Speaker 0: but good God where the badge is crap.

262
00:15:43,303 --> 00:15:46,357
Speaker 1: I mean a lot of them were new shows which okay.

263
00:15:46,397 --> 00:15:47,040
Speaker 0: Here's the problem.

264
00:15:47,261 --> 00:15:47,842
Speaker 0: that's a word.

265
00:15:48,003 --> 00:15:57,000
Speaker 0: they were new shows and I'm making quote marks with my fingers because they're the shows that are Currently being released on DVD or on TV in the u.s.

266
00:15:57,271 --> 00:15:58,083
Speaker 1: Yeah it's great.

267
00:15:58,203 --> 00:16:01,356
Speaker 0: now the problem with this is that the shows that are currently coming out in the u.s.

268
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:10,925
Speaker 0: Are Earlier in the year and last year in Japan and that was a drought for us anime wise and it wasn't that much really good To watch.

269
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:22,220
Speaker 1: my real problem was that it's okay If you use shows that are currently being released in the u.s But you should you know, try to cover at least one from each major genre of anime.

270
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:28,040
Speaker 1: I mean, I chose the speed graph for one which is not a show that's really worth finishing.

271
00:16:28,461 --> 00:16:30,167
Speaker 1: I mean you could just watch a few episodes of that.

272
00:16:30,187 --> 00:16:30,889
Speaker 1: show is done.

273
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,334
Speaker 0: Did we review speedgrapher?

274
00:16:32,435 --> 00:16:32,936
Speaker 1: No, but it's.

275
00:16:33,017 --> 00:16:36,488
Speaker 1: it's one of the only Shows that I actually recognized.

276
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:39,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, I kind of figured what a couple of the shows are.

277
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,926
Speaker 0: I picked a random badge this year.

278
00:16:41,287 --> 00:16:42,290
Speaker 1: Yeah weird.

279
00:16:42,611 --> 00:16:44,999
Speaker 0: The other thing was that I mean every year forever.

280
00:16:45,802 --> 00:16:51,805
Speaker 0: Whenever we saw the badge selection, it was always whoo, and there was a big debate like oh check it out They got that and they got that.

281
00:16:51,826 --> 00:16:54,176
Speaker 0: or oh, there's Nesca floating water over this year.

282
00:16:54,296 --> 00:16:59,459
Speaker 0: Everyone went And we all looked at each other to make sure that we were all seeing the same thing.

283
00:17:00,122 --> 00:17:01,127
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean like is there?

284
00:17:01,268 --> 00:17:03,036
Speaker 1: maybe they have twice as many badges this year.

285
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:03,840
Speaker 1: Is there another board?

286
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:11,339
Speaker 0: I need to look at or something though At least there are a bunch of explanations for what happened and hopefully we'll talk to some Otakon staff and get some more official answers.

287
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:17,359
Speaker 0: But I've heard that one the industry pretty much decides what the badges are because they are the ones who did.

288
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:19,369
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is they're the ones who give permission.

289
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,319
Speaker 0: You can't just use anime on a badge.

290
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,204
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know.

291
00:17:22,404 --> 00:17:28,417
Speaker 0: and so generally from what I gather Otakon will tell the industry hey, we need badges send us art and we'll pick some things.

292
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:38,248
Speaker 0: and I heard that one the industry sent the badges that they want or they've sent the anime that they want to promote Which sadly is not the anime I care about.

293
00:17:38,328 --> 00:17:47,331
Speaker 0: but that that is understandable - apparently they did not send Most of their art in the proper format for Otakon to use.

294
00:17:47,392 --> 00:17:50,540
Speaker 0: thus Otakon was forced to ignore most of the submissions.

295
00:17:50,901 --> 00:17:56,356
Speaker 1: Yeah, Otakon really whoever does the badges should like get on the industry earlier and be like.

296
00:17:56,857 --> 00:18:00,260
Speaker 1: these are the badges We want send us art for these shows.

297
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:06,796
Speaker 1: We need at least one robot show one showing in fighting show one show Joe drama, you know.

298
00:18:07,117 --> 00:18:12,543
Speaker 1: one kitty show One cutesy show one crazy comedy, you know That's what they need.

299
00:18:12,623 --> 00:18:20,320
Speaker 0: someone in the Otakon forum said there should be a policy that every year there is one Gundam or giant robot fashioned bad.

300
00:18:20,529 --> 00:18:23,890
Speaker 1: Yes that way no matter what I can default to the robot badge.

301
00:18:24,211 --> 00:18:24,913
Speaker 0: now the bet.

302
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:33,100
Speaker 0: the most telling sign that the badges really were kind Of mad this year was that the one badge that everyone recognized was the Hellsing badge.

303
00:18:33,945 --> 00:18:37,622
Speaker 0: That badge ran out almost immediately Mm-hmm.

304
00:18:38,324 --> 00:18:39,548
Speaker 0: I heard other badges.

305
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:40,592
Speaker 1: We're all plentiful.

306
00:18:40,973 --> 00:18:47,098
Speaker 0: Yep, and honestly throughout the whole con I had no idea what my badge was until someone told isn't it Trinity blood.

307
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:49,266
Speaker 1: Yeah I watched the first episode of that show.

308
00:18:49,286 --> 00:18:51,695
Speaker 1: I say it's crap, but that's just.

309
00:18:51,735 --> 00:18:52,960
Speaker 1: that's a quick review right there.

310
00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:57,959
Speaker 0: Now the other problem here is that we're watching like pretty much what's on TV in Japan right now.

311
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,417
Speaker 1: Now if there had been a Nana bad, I would have snatched that up.

312
00:19:01,437 --> 00:19:03,172
Speaker 0: a good god There should have been a Nana badge.

313
00:19:03,213 --> 00:19:03,940
Speaker 1: there should have been.

314
00:19:04,801 --> 00:19:05,303
Speaker 1: It should have been.

315
00:19:05,664 --> 00:19:09,640
Speaker 1: you know, in fact, there should have been two Nana badges a serious one and kind of a goofy one.

316
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,964
Speaker 0: You Know what?

317
00:19:12,004 --> 00:19:14,196
Speaker 0: I would have been happy if they made all the badges Nana.

318
00:19:14,337 --> 00:19:14,558
Speaker 1: Yeah.

319
00:19:14,639 --> 00:19:18,020
Speaker 1: All right Let's stop spending so much time talking about the badges.

320
00:19:18,181 --> 00:19:21,798
Speaker 0: Well, the badges are one of our few complaints about Otakon say are one of the few complaints.

321
00:19:22,139 --> 00:19:22,220
Speaker 0: now.

322
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,440
Speaker 0: I will note in other general con stuff that the Otakon con book was full color.

323
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:34,963
Speaker 0: Maybe there's something going on with the full color publishing because first kinetic on was oh our book is full color And it was super cheap.

324
00:19:35,003 --> 00:19:36,610
Speaker 0: and now suddenly Otakon is full color.

325
00:19:36,691 --> 00:19:38,920
Speaker 1: It does look like it's from the same printing company.

326
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,028
Speaker 1: Can we find out what company prints these things?

327
00:19:41,129 --> 00:19:44,040
Speaker 0: Probably I didn't look into that at all.

328
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:51,861
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm looking for like a publisher a printer on here, but I can't find one at all now.

329
00:19:51,881 --> 00:20:02,300
Speaker 0: the other thing they've done with the con book this year is that the book had very little in the way of Otakon scheduling stuff or stuff about Otakon and it was mostly articles written by people.

330
00:20:02,381 --> 00:20:03,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, it also had fewer ads.

331
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:09,655
Speaker 1: I mean it's less ads but if you were ads than previous years Usually the Otakon con book is just loaded with ads.

332
00:20:09,716 --> 00:20:10,600
Speaker 1: this year not so many.

333
00:20:10,821 --> 00:20:12,610
Speaker 0: It was pretty much just straight-up informative.

334
00:20:13,032 --> 00:20:19,394
Speaker 0: and then a whole bunch of fairly Interesting articles about the con or about anime or about Japanese films in general.

335
00:20:19,715 --> 00:20:21,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, which I thought was cool.

336
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:23,098
Speaker 1: I mean, I think last year wasn't there.

337
00:20:24,142 --> 00:20:26,800
Speaker 1: There was an article about the the Philippine.

338
00:20:27,362 --> 00:20:30,413
Speaker 1: Every year there was a lot of action stuff and that's what they showed.

339
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:34,225
Speaker 1: in the live-action room was a lot of Filipino Live just this year.

340
00:20:34,265 --> 00:20:36,432
Speaker 0: the sheer number of well-written articles.

341
00:20:36,452 --> 00:20:37,034
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

342
00:20:37,174 --> 00:20:38,057
Speaker 1: I think there are three of them.

343
00:20:38,097 --> 00:20:39,020
Speaker 1: They were pretty big too.

344
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:45,697
Speaker 0: Yeah, also in previous years, you'd usually see people walking around with the con book and their little pocket schedule.

345
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:51,300
Speaker 0: this year I did not see a single person who hadn't just registered walking around with the con book.

346
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:54,372
Speaker 0: They all carried around the new format pocket schedule.

347
00:20:54,533 --> 00:20:57,223
Speaker 1: Oh, the new pocket schedule is the bomb I had.

348
00:20:57,484 --> 00:21:02,400
Speaker 0: the only gripe at all I had with it is that you can't get Saturday folded correctly.

349
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,056
Speaker 0: Exactly that the main crease the biggest crease in the entire thing goes right through the middle of Saturday.

350
00:21:08,096 --> 00:21:08,317
Speaker 1: Yes.

351
00:21:08,718 --> 00:21:09,560
Speaker 1: This is perfect.

352
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,711
Speaker 1: This is a thousand times better than the previous Otakon thing.

353
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:15,140
Speaker 1: In fact, every convention should have something just like this.

354
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:25,819
Speaker 1: However, you need to have the folds match the days so that someone can easily go BAM Friday BAM Saturday BAM Sunday without unfurling a giant piece of paper.

355
00:21:26,321 --> 00:21:31,580
Speaker 0: Now the other thing is that it was very very large and while it folded folded easily like a map.

356
00:21:31,801 --> 00:21:34,150
Speaker 0: I know some people had some difficulty refolding it.

357
00:21:34,532 --> 00:21:36,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's people who don't know how to fold

358
00:21:37,441 --> 00:21:47,435
Speaker 0: But to the easy way to mitigate that I mean this thing was huge and it had not only the schedules But all of the con information including descriptions of all the panels and descriptions

359
00:21:47,495 --> 00:21:49,743
Speaker 1: of all the panels and all the showings Which is terrific.

360
00:21:50,124 --> 00:21:54,080
Speaker 0: if they had to though, they could have gotten rid of the description to the panels and showings.

361
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, they could have put those in the con book.

362
00:21:56,201 --> 00:21:59,780
Speaker 1: I mean it was handy to have them there, but I didn't really need them at the con.

363
00:21:59,941 --> 00:22:02,838
Speaker 1: You know, I could have looked those up in the in my hotel room.

364
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,711
Speaker 0: true But we're the kind of people who do a lot of research ahead of time.

365
00:22:05,872 --> 00:22:07,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know other people don't is true?

366
00:22:07,941 --> 00:22:08,543
Speaker 1: Yeah, it really.

367
00:22:08,563 --> 00:22:12,960
Speaker 1: it doesn't matter where those things are as long as they are available, you know.

368
00:22:13,141 --> 00:22:25,272
Speaker 1: But definitely in this thing it was handy to have the schedule printed in an easier to read format not with those oval things and Also the hours of operation were printed nicely and one of the sides.

369
00:22:25,332 --> 00:22:33,580
Speaker 1: However, there was a little bit of confusion Where they printed what it say it said like Sunday 1 p.m To close you should net you shouldn't do that.

370
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,769
Speaker 1: You need a time there, but that's the only.

371
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:38,239
Speaker 1: that's a tiny ass complaint if I ever seen one.

372
00:22:39,281 --> 00:22:42,875
Speaker 0: Now as for the con in general, it had slightly over 22,000 people this year.

373
00:22:44,542 --> 00:22:48,455
Speaker 1: It was like 300 more people than last year, which is essentially nothing.

374
00:22:48,556 --> 00:22:49,760
Speaker 0: That means no one was turned away.

375
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:51,333
Speaker 1: Yeah, no one was turned away.

376
00:22:51,393 --> 00:22:55,271
Speaker 1: But also Otakon isn't growing as rapidly as it was before.

377
00:22:55,331 --> 00:22:59,980
Speaker 0: I mean they grew by 1% Yep, but then again, there could be a lot of reasons for that.

378
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:05,639
Speaker 0: I mean having a limit on the con at all is a certainly Chilling factor for people who may or may not be sure if they're gonna go.

379
00:23:06,362 --> 00:23:11,840
Speaker 0: The fact that they've gotten rid of group discounts the fact that they've gotten rid of one day passes probably really cut down.

380
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:18,521
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah The one the lack of one day passes probably did kill a lot of the thing is I think the lack of one day passes is Fine.

381
00:23:18,842 --> 00:23:19,906
Speaker 1: I do think it's fine.

382
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,873
Speaker 1: It's but a convention so large.

383
00:23:21,953 --> 00:23:23,860
Speaker 1: I think you're perfectly justified in doing that.

384
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:31,699
Speaker 0: Yes, I mean they've saved so much time and money and effort and people who want to be there for three days have such a Bigger advantage now in terms of actually enjoying the con.

385
00:23:32,221 --> 00:23:38,140
Speaker 1: I do still think that to appease the dealers that they should have some sort of Sunday dealer room pass.

386
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,560
Speaker 1: You know where you can go to the dealers room and not do anything else.

387
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:47,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, I suggested that last year too and the main reason is there might be a slight logistical problem with it, though.

388
00:23:47,483 --> 00:23:55,398
Speaker 0: well the main reason they don't is that the reason they got rid of day passes primarily was because it's a nightmare for the security people to Mm-hmm and to.

389
00:23:56,481 --> 00:23:58,349
Speaker 0: They'd have to keep all of these stuff.

390
00:23:58,369 --> 00:24:01,140
Speaker 0: They use to differentiate in place to have Sunday things.

391
00:24:01,781 --> 00:24:08,700
Speaker 0: Yep, in addition to that now They have to worry about the fire code on Sunday instead of just knowing that there aren't enough badges to break the fire code.

392
00:24:08,722 --> 00:24:21,200
Speaker 1: Yeah See that the solution that I would come up with is one that no one would probably agree with who actually has to work at The con but would be to have a special after-hours dealers room open only, you know.

393
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:27,700
Speaker 1: So like at like two or three you close the dealers room except to a bunch of people who paid for dealers room only.

394
00:24:28,121 --> 00:24:31,010
Speaker 0: You know, yeah, but the logistical concerns of that are insane.

395
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:31,813
Speaker 1: Yes, they are.

396
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:39,553
Speaker 1: or like maybe open the dealers room on You know for like certain hours before it really opens on Friday.

397
00:24:39,653 --> 00:24:40,075
Speaker 1: I don't know.

398
00:24:40,095 --> 00:24:41,780
Speaker 0: I say just don't worry about it.

399
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,788
Speaker 0: There's no reason to change something that works so well.

400
00:24:43,969 --> 00:24:44,170
Speaker 0: Yep.

401
00:24:44,331 --> 00:24:44,531
Speaker 3: Yeah.

402
00:24:44,551 --> 00:24:52,200
Speaker 0: Yeah now in terms of staff Despite the fact there were more people at Otacon there were fewer staff and I have to say it was noticeable.

403
00:24:52,564 --> 00:24:53,191
Speaker 1: Yes, it was.

404
00:24:53,211 --> 00:24:53,959
Speaker 1: I don't know.

405
00:24:54,140 --> 00:25:03,710
Speaker 1: It could have been just that the staff shirts didn't stand out as much but I'm fairly confident that there were much fewer staff at Otacon this year and according to the official statistics there were less staff.

406
00:25:03,851 --> 00:25:28,033
Speaker 1: Okay, and you can't really blame Otacon that much I mean you can put a little blame on them for having less staff because it did hurt the con noticeably that there were not enough staff and They could have done more to recruit more staff but at the same time you got to blame the fans because the staff are all fan volunteers, so People aren't volunteering enough time to Otacon and they should get on that.

407
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:28,755
Speaker 0: Yep.

408
00:25:28,915 --> 00:25:31,824
Speaker 0: Well then again, I mean our friend Scott Johnson just joined the staff.

409
00:25:32,005 --> 00:25:32,186
Speaker 0: Yep.

410
00:25:32,286 --> 00:25:34,032
Speaker 0: So we're all getting in on that action.

411
00:25:34,313 --> 00:25:34,554
Speaker 1: Yep.

412
00:25:34,654 --> 00:25:36,240
Speaker 1: So we're not shit talkers.

413
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:37,168
Speaker 1: Is that what you're saying?

414
00:25:37,734 --> 00:25:38,319
Speaker 0: something like that?

415
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,344
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you should.

416
00:25:39,465 --> 00:25:46,298
Speaker 1: if you think Otacon isn't you know needs more staff Don't complain about it unless you are signing up to be staff.

417
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:55,038
Speaker 0: Yep I mean when we did our critique of Connecticut a while back the first thing the Connecticut staff told to us was People like you need to join the staff basically.

418
00:25:55,239 --> 00:26:03,585
Speaker 1: Yep It's like if you complain about a con not having enough staff or having shitty staff and you don't join the staff or attempt to Join the staff of that convention.

419
00:26:03,886 --> 00:26:04,589
Speaker 1: You can shut up.

420
00:26:05,091 --> 00:26:07,459
Speaker 1: Yep, and that's all I got to say about that.

421
00:26:08,123 --> 00:26:11,300
Speaker 0: But despite the lower number of staff the con went very smoothly.

422
00:26:11,461 --> 00:26:15,998
Speaker 0: I don't think there were any major events other than people passing out from the heat.

423
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:17,222
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean there were.

424
00:26:17,283 --> 00:26:21,497
Speaker 1: there were some incidents that were beyond our vision probably behind the scenes.

425
00:26:21,597 --> 00:26:22,380
Speaker 0: Yes, there was one.

426
00:26:23,023 --> 00:26:31,980
Speaker 0: anonymous staffers explained to me that something happened with the staff whereupon There was a. they kept calling it a crisis and I don't know exactly what happened.

427
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:36,836
Speaker 0: But a number of staff were laid up dealing with some sort of problem Saturday afternoon.

428
00:26:36,856 --> 00:26:39,425
Speaker 0: Ah Whatever I don't.

429
00:26:39,485 --> 00:26:40,308
Speaker 0: I think it involved.

430
00:26:40,369 --> 00:26:45,569
Speaker 0: it was an internal matter and I don't know anything more than that because everyone was very Anonymous and very vague about it.

431
00:26:46,091 --> 00:26:55,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only thing that got me about Otakon staff was I think we were in the panel room once right and you know in the panel room is the cool panel guy.

432
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,144
Speaker 1: What's his name?

433
00:26:56,628 --> 00:26:57,877
Speaker 1: Dragon Master will ooh, right?

434
00:26:58,078 --> 00:27:12,272
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Yeah, and he was sitting there and this other staffer pretty high-level staffer because you know, they're high-level staff for when they have a radio He thought necessarily no not necessarily but I mean at Katsu khan they give the gophers Radio.

435
00:27:12,454 --> 00:27:13,820
Speaker 1: Oh, wow But yeah.

436
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:20,320
Speaker 1: Anyway, he comes in and he like introduces himself to the other guy and it's like okay too high-level staff never met each other.

437
00:27:20,962 --> 00:27:27,320
Speaker 1: Maybe they should do like Otakon should have at least one Some sort of coordination beating before the car.

438
00:27:27,449 --> 00:27:32,455
Speaker 0: No The way the reason that happens that Otakon is very delegated and compartmentalized.

439
00:27:32,555 --> 00:27:33,358
Speaker 1: it is it is.

440
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:38,240
Speaker 1: but still You should you know get to know the other people that you have to work with, you know, cuz there's no way.

441
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,027
Speaker 0: There's like 500 staffers.

442
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:40,970
Speaker 0: That's cool.

443
00:27:41,271 --> 00:27:43,460
Speaker 0: And most of them don't live anywhere near Baltimore.

444
00:27:45,401 --> 00:27:47,287
Speaker 1: Most kelly's the highest-level people.

445
00:27:47,588 --> 00:27:50,116
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the highest-level people do know each other for the most part.

446
00:27:50,297 --> 00:27:55,900
Speaker 0: Yeah still I kind of weird that you know Scott I point out that our radio does not mean high-level staff.

447
00:27:56,121 --> 00:27:56,642
Speaker 1: That's true.

448
00:27:56,803 --> 00:27:58,148
Speaker 0: You know, what means high-level staff?

449
00:27:58,489 --> 00:27:59,814
Speaker 0: if they always look busy.

450
00:28:00,135 --> 00:28:07,414
Speaker 0: They're not dealing with crowds They're listening to a microphone stoically or they're listening to a headphone stoically and then they suddenly disappear.

451
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, that is a high-level staffer.

452
00:28:11,968 --> 00:28:14,164
Speaker 1: Anyway What else went down?

453
00:28:14,184 --> 00:28:19,500
Speaker 0: I mean there were no major issues that I'm aware of and the con was generally well-run.

454
00:28:19,721 --> 00:28:35,299
Speaker 1: I think the only other real problem with the con was that there were certain there were lines for certain events that caused light trouble and more more staff could have made that smoother and Possibly some sort of system that someone could have come up with might help it.

455
00:28:35,783 --> 00:28:41,234
Speaker 1: I think all they really need to do is put you know Make the people do the swirly lines around some tape on the floor.

456
00:28:41,254 --> 00:28:42,640
Speaker 0: Oh, no, they're easier ways than that.

457
00:28:43,041 --> 00:28:54,179
Speaker 0: I mean an amazement has a no line policy where you're not allowed to stand in line And I don't really want to talk about it in great detail because that would really take away from all the.

458
00:28:54,279 --> 00:29:07,380
Speaker 1: oh I'm saying is that there there there were events that were incredibly popular and long lines formed for certain panels and showings and that a Sis there could be a system in place to prevent the trouble that is caused by that.

459
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,806
Speaker 0: Well, here's the problem here.

460
00:29:08,987 --> 00:29:12,160
Speaker 0: Most of those lines were completely unwarranted.

461
00:29:12,495 --> 00:29:22,980
Speaker 0: Yeah Because other than panels that have a limited number of people who can get in there was absolutely no reason To line up for the dealers room or to line up to get into the artists alley.

462
00:29:23,142 --> 00:29:26,404
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, let's talk about the dealers room line Friday morning.

463
00:29:26,846 --> 00:29:29,579
Speaker 0: All right, so and then we'll we'll skip a bit in our list here.

464
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:32,530
Speaker 0: But yeah Friday morning the dealers room opened.

465
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:33,995
Speaker 0: actually in the afternoon it opened late.

466
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:37,379
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's see When do the official hours say it opens?

467
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:43,137
Speaker 1: dealers room on Friday opens at noon now it closes at 8 p.m.

468
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,728
Speaker 1: So it stays open later than any other day on.

469
00:29:45,768 --> 00:29:48,680
Speaker 0: people lined up the moment the con opened.

470
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:57,086
Speaker 0: In fact before the con opened a line that had at least a thousand people in it formed outside the con Trying to get into the main entrance.

471
00:29:57,367 --> 00:29:57,608
Speaker 1: Yep.

472
00:29:57,969 --> 00:30:15,718
Speaker 0: Now these people were all stupid because we walked right up to any of the other entrances and walked right in because as every piece of literature about Otakon says at The moment the con opens any member with a badge can go in any door.

473
00:30:15,739 --> 00:30:22,539
Speaker 1: now There was a couple doors where they were preventing us from getting in despite our badge possessions and that was ass.

474
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:30,679
Speaker 0: No, that made perfect sense because those specific doors and there were only three of them Empathy directly into places where people line up.

475
00:30:31,402 --> 00:30:35,800
Speaker 0: They also are right near registration and right in the middle one near registration.

476
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,329
Speaker 1: I'm not talking about the ones down in the tunnel area.

477
00:30:38,349 --> 00:30:41,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, those were surrounded by the line for registration.

478
00:30:42,682 --> 00:30:43,245
Speaker 0: There are a lot.

479
00:30:43,305 --> 00:30:50,736
Speaker 0: there is a great number of people without badges in a Massive mob right outside all of those doors and those doors go directly into lines.

480
00:30:50,977 --> 00:30:51,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's all right.

481
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:54,337
Speaker 0: They had good reasons for that and every other door was open.

482
00:30:54,498 --> 00:31:02,752
Speaker 0: Yep Yeah, but despite this at least a thousand people lined up stupidly to get in and we told a few people, you know You didn't have to stand in that line and they didn't believe us.

483
00:31:03,215 --> 00:31:03,516
Speaker 1: Yeah.

484
00:31:03,998 --> 00:31:10,660
Speaker 0: Oh well Anyway, but the dealers room two people lined up immediately and sat there for at least four hours before they could get in.

485
00:31:10,761 --> 00:31:11,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like what do you think?

486
00:31:12,201 --> 00:31:18,008
Speaker 1: I mean if you're if you're gonna wait in line to go to the dealers room the line should be like at the last hour.

487
00:31:18,068 --> 00:31:21,820
Speaker 1: the dealers room is open on Sunday because that's when they start giving the shit away at.

488
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:27,933
Speaker 1: you know rock bottom prices and Nowadays, you can just walk in and get a cacti or any time you want.

489
00:31:27,993 --> 00:31:29,740
Speaker 1: The ton berries are plentiful these days.

490
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was nothing rare at the con at all.

491
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:35,940
Speaker 1: There are no rare things that are going to sell out that you can't get.

492
00:31:36,101 --> 00:31:39,500
Speaker 1: So what the hell is the point of going into the dealers room right away?

493
00:31:39,883 --> 00:31:41,700
Speaker 0: The best part is I didn't record this.

494
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:50,158
Speaker 0: well I recorded this interview but it came out kind of crappy because the key people I talked to were kind of shy and quiet or The other people I talked to were really loud but far away and it didn't work.

495
00:31:51,122 --> 00:32:02,660
Speaker 0: But of all the people who were sitting pretty much right near the front of the line to get into the dealers room meaning they had Been sitting there for about four hours Mm-hmm does the con opens at eight and the dealers room opens at noon?

496
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:07,360
Speaker 1: Why would you sit there for four hours when for the majority of the con?

497
00:32:07,701 --> 00:32:10,088
Speaker 1: You can just walk into the dealers room with no line at all.

498
00:32:10,449 --> 00:32:10,610
Speaker 0: Now.

499
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:14,040
Speaker 0: I asked them this like are you here to get anything specific?

500
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,810
Speaker 0: Why are you waiting for the dealers room?

501
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:17,240
Speaker 0: You know, what's the special thing?

502
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,620
Speaker 0: You think's gonna sell out and no one had anything.

503
00:32:21,082 --> 00:32:24,754
Speaker 0: They just wanted to go into the dealers room and they really didn't have any reason.

504
00:32:24,814 --> 00:32:28,269
Speaker 0: like I tried to ask him You know, there's nothing to do.

505
00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:28,751
Speaker 0: Are you?

506
00:32:28,912 --> 00:32:30,720
Speaker 0: you don't have any panels to go to two later?

507
00:32:30,981 --> 00:32:32,326
Speaker 0: They didn't really have any answer for me.

508
00:32:33,149 --> 00:32:33,370
Speaker 1: Huh?

509
00:32:34,274 --> 00:32:35,940
Speaker 1: I guess they're just consumer whores.

510
00:32:36,542 --> 00:32:37,386
Speaker 0: I really didn't get it.

511
00:32:37,486 --> 00:32:40,479
Speaker 0: I couldn't get out of these people why they were in line for the dealers room.

512
00:32:40,499 --> 00:32:44,619
Speaker 0: a Few people didn't know that it didn't open until noon.

513
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:48,552
Speaker 0: They got out of line when they found out from me while I interviewed them.

514
00:32:48,813 --> 00:32:51,180
Speaker 1: Those people were intelligent yet ignorant.

515
00:32:51,381 --> 00:32:55,600
Speaker 0: There was also a large group of people just playing DS's and drawing penises on picto chat in the line.

516
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,886
Speaker 0: So they were doing something.

517
00:32:57,107 --> 00:33:00,242
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, hey if all you wanted to do was play DS Cuz.

518
00:33:00,282 --> 00:33:01,389
Speaker 1: nothing else is interesting.

519
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,059
Speaker 1: The line was a great place to go.

520
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:04,913
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are all kinds of people at.

521
00:33:04,933 --> 00:33:05,860
Speaker 1: DS is ready to play.

522
00:33:06,282 --> 00:33:08,900
Speaker 0: I felt bad for the staff or who had to deal with that stupid line.

523
00:33:09,462 --> 00:33:12,758
Speaker 1: what they should do is they should just say there is no dealers room line.

524
00:33:13,099 --> 00:33:17,440
Speaker 1: or You know, maybe find a way to open the dealers room when the con opens on Friday.

525
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:23,180
Speaker 0: I know that'd be hard But I can see a lot of very good reasons why they wanted the dealers room to open late.

526
00:33:23,684 --> 00:33:25,740
Speaker 0: Because the dealers room being open when the con opens.

527
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:32,399
Speaker 0: That's the first thing most people go to and as a result any panels that are Friday morning get completely decimated.

528
00:33:32,961 --> 00:33:33,824
Speaker 1: I guess I guess.

529
00:33:33,924 --> 00:33:38,420
Speaker 1: but if you lay it by an hour instead of four hours, I think the way it was was fine.

530
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,790
Speaker 0: Just don't let people line up for it.

531
00:33:40,072 --> 00:33:41,658
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course then again You know what?

532
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:48,180
Speaker 0: Let people line up for it because that keeps people who aren't the brightest bulbs out of everyone else's way Friday morning.

533
00:33:48,802 --> 00:33:50,107
Speaker 1: Mmm, maybe they should.

534
00:33:50,147 --> 00:33:53,240
Speaker 1: and well the thing was at the line for that dealers room, right?

535
00:33:53,861 --> 00:33:58,700
Speaker 1: It was directed in the building and then out, you know towards the escalator area.

536
00:33:59,141 --> 00:34:01,610
Speaker 1: Maybe they have directed it out the tunnel to the street.

537
00:34:02,092 --> 00:34:04,440
Speaker 0: They couldn't because out that tunnel was the registration.

538
00:34:04,581 --> 00:34:12,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if they bent the registration line towards the base Because you can't line up outside of the Convention Center grounds.

539
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:16,280
Speaker 0: Remember what happened at during the or before the Laraku concert two years ago?

540
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,127
Speaker 0: Yeah, when the state police came.

541
00:34:18,147 --> 00:34:18,909
Speaker 0: Yeah.

542
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:24,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know They handled it the best they could other than not letting people line up.

543
00:34:25,844 --> 00:34:32,755
Speaker 0: I can think of a whole bunch of ways to solve the line problems But I think we'll talk about that more when we try to interview some of the staffers in the coming weeks.

544
00:34:33,016 --> 00:34:36,326
Speaker 0: Okay, so Let's go to the geek nights meetup.

545
00:34:36,627 --> 00:34:38,875
Speaker 1: All right, we had a geek night's meetup out on the patio.

546
00:34:38,895 --> 00:34:42,649
Speaker 0: a few people showed up Yep, and rather than talk about it right away.

547
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:44,616

635
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,919
Speaker 2: I actually saw it many years before they said it and I was sitting there going.

636
00:39:22,005 --> 00:39:37,499
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, I got to say the fans of geek nights who actually hung out with us at Otakon were the people who I'd kind of Picked out in the forums over the course of you know, the last many months as people who are generally agreeable to me.

637
00:39:38,104 --> 00:39:39,639
Speaker 0: So Peter, how's Otakon treating you so far?

638
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:42,919
Speaker 2: You have anything you like to say to our listeners out there?

639
00:39:44,304 --> 00:39:45,298
Speaker 0: What do you need for dinner tonight?

640
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:50,279
Speaker 1: Slayer yeah, there are some other people in the forum who are agreeable to me.

641
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,200
Speaker 1: They did not show up, but the people who did show up were generally awesome.

642
00:39:54,421 --> 00:40:08,198
Speaker 0: We're not going to give you the list of people but suffice to say there's a group of about five or six people in the forums Outside of the actual front row crew Who Scott and I have found we can count on to say the kinds of things we would say even when we're not there.

643
00:40:08,218 --> 00:40:12,751
Speaker 0: Yep We actually haven't been there much lately due to being busy with life.

644
00:40:13,152 --> 00:40:13,353
Speaker 0: Yep.

645
00:40:14,095 --> 00:40:15,760
Speaker 1: Okay, let's talk about what was in the dealers room.

646
00:40:16,446 --> 00:40:19,929
Speaker 0: Oh, you don't want to talk about the meetup More to say about it.

647
00:40:19,949 --> 00:40:22,339
Speaker 1: I mean we played audio of it and that was pretty much it.

648
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,494
Speaker 0: Yeah, well aside from that we also hung out with the anime world order people.

649
00:40:26,755 --> 00:40:30,525
Speaker 0: Yeah Gerald and Daryl Some things happened.

650

Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll talk about.

651
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:33,212
Speaker 1: I'll talk about that.

652
00:40:33,854 --> 00:40:39,071
Speaker 0: And also I'd like to give a plug for Next week probably Wednesday, maybe Thursday.

653
00:40:39,111 --> 00:40:41,760
Speaker 0: I'm not exactly sure yet, but I recorded well.

654
00:40:41,840 --> 00:41:00,220
Speaker 0: We recorded two separate long round tables that were actually we use the real equipment instead of that crappy recording bit One with a whole bunch of webcomic artists including a guy who does Dominic Deegan seer for hire It's in classic guy who does that and I know who does fallen and a few other people.

655
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,249
Speaker 1: Yeah, I promised that a week from tomorrow.

656
00:41:02,289 --> 00:41:03,032
Speaker 1: We would do the.

657
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:04,720
Speaker 1: what is the front row crew episode?

658
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:05,418
Speaker 1: All right.

659
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:13,600
Speaker 1: So I guess the next two Wednesdays are gonna be recordings from Otakon one involving webcomics and one involving clown pistols.

660
00:41:14,942 --> 00:41:29,250
Speaker 0: and in addition to that round table, we recorded a Kind of late-night half drunken us talking about anime and anime cons thing with anime world order Ninja consultant and fast karate for the gentleman fast karate.

661
00:41:29,691 --> 00:41:32,138
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's slow karate faster.

662
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:38,299
Speaker 0: now Once again, I have things to say about that round table, which I think I'm going to play a short clip from tonight.

663
00:41:38,701 --> 00:41:41,319
Speaker 0: But the whole thing will be available at some point next week.

664
00:41:41,721 --> 00:41:42,825
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe we'll just.

665
00:41:42,966 --> 00:41:46,239
Speaker 1: I figure we would do that a week from today or two weeks from today.

666
00:41:46,259 --> 00:41:49,074
Speaker 0: true But I might play the relevant clip from it tonight.

667
00:41:49,175 --> 00:41:53,149
Speaker 1: I think that's a good idea Alright, so in the dealers room.

668
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:54,553
Speaker 1: It was a dealers room.

669
00:41:54,774 --> 00:41:54,934
Speaker 0: Yep.

670
00:41:55,075 --> 00:41:56,118
Speaker 0: It was a massive.

671
00:41:56,178 --> 00:42:00,428
Speaker 1: as always The industry area was kind of like sparse.

672
00:42:00,468 --> 00:42:04,820
Speaker 1: I mean Bandai wasn't there and Viz wasn't there and those were like my big places.

673
00:42:04,921 --> 00:42:05,466
Speaker 1: that's where I go.

674
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:10,590
Speaker 1: Viz has the bags and You know Bandai has the robots and they were not there.

675
00:42:10,771 --> 00:42:13,020
Speaker 0: In fact, there was almost no free stuff this year.

676
00:42:13,441 --> 00:42:17,135
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean now the thing is no Khan has had free stuff for a while.

677
00:42:17,155 --> 00:42:19,367
Speaker 1: I Don't know what's up with that.

678
00:42:19,608 --> 00:42:22,023
Speaker 0: Well, I don't think the industry is doing so well But here's the thing.

679
00:42:22,043 --> 00:42:29,259
Speaker 1: if you go to in all the panels a lot of the industry panels In fact, pretty much all the industry panels what they did is they would do trivia and free stuff.

680
00:42:29,822 --> 00:42:36,127
Speaker 1: that's like the big thing at panels now is trivia and then giving away DVDs and But they're not giving away.

681
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:38,660
Speaker 1: like the free goodies in the dealers room.

682
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:43,174
Speaker 1: The artists alley is still giving away free goodies, but not the dealers and not the industry.

683
00:42:43,274 --> 00:42:45,200
Speaker 0: what the hell now in terms of what?

684
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,130
Speaker 0: We bought I mean the dealers room was impressive.

685
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:51,080
Speaker 0: as far as Otakon dealers rooms go it is big.

686
00:42:51,281 --> 00:42:55,134
Speaker 1: But they didn't fill the dealers room, but they did have more dealers than last year.

687
00:42:55,495 --> 00:42:55,676
Speaker 0: Yep.

688
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:03,440
Speaker 0: Oh, well I didn't buy much just because I bought everything I wanted to buy this year at anime next and to an extent at a con.

689
00:43:03,801 --> 00:43:07,699
Speaker 1: I mean I pretty much bought anything I wanted there and there wasn't that much that I wanted.

690
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:08,804
Speaker 1: that I didn't already have.

691
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:11,554
Speaker 0: I kind of wanted the Death Note box thing.

692
00:43:11,674 --> 00:43:13,200
Speaker 0: I just didn't get around to buying it.

693
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, it's just too much money.

694
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:19,616
Speaker 1: It's like I wanted the original Galaxy Express 3 9 movie poster, but for 30 bucks.

695
00:43:19,817 --> 00:43:28,540
Speaker 0: you can yeah You know, but almost the entire front row crew each bought the giant robo box set.

696
00:43:28,842 --> 00:43:31,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were selling all of giant robo.

697
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:39,533
Speaker 1: I have Vogler in this plastic eyeball for I think 30 bucks But another guy had it for 25 and another guy had a used one.

698
00:43:39,573 --> 00:43:40,516
Speaker 1: That was beat up for 10.

699
00:43:40,516 --> 00:43:44,986
Speaker 0: Yep And at least seven of us bought it.

700
00:43:45,166 --> 00:43:47,252
Speaker 3: Yep and buy right DVD.

701
00:43:47,593 --> 00:43:50,220
Speaker 3: who is the ultimate seller of cheap DVDs?

702
00:43:50,601 --> 00:43:55,480
Speaker 3: Those are the guys who sold the $5 DVDs and everything you can buy from their website.

703
00:43:55,681 --> 00:43:58,580
Speaker 3: But then you have to make a minimum order of like a whole mess of DVDs.

704
00:43:58,821 --> 00:44:01,920
Speaker 3: But if you see them at a con you can buy just one DVD for five bucks.

705
00:44:02,784 --> 00:44:11,293
Speaker 3: They were selling among many other very cheap box sets The Zeta Gundam box set which comes with a ton of shit in it.

706
00:44:11,634 --> 00:44:13,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, didn't it come with like 12 pencil sharpeners?

707
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:19,160
Speaker 3: Yeah, it came with 12 robot pencil sharpeners, which are much more robot than pencil sharpener.

708
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:25,990
Speaker 3: I don't know why they even put the pencil sharpeners in there because they're just robot toys Through a specific scene for family guy.

709
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:28,100
Speaker 3: They were selling this box set for 40 bucks.

710
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,549
Speaker 3: Now this was like supposed to be a $200 box set.

711
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:36,992
Speaker 3: now 40 bucks 50 episodes Plus swag as less than a buck an episode and free swag.

712
00:44:37,494 --> 00:44:39,460
Speaker 0: now wasn't it the one with the broken subtitles?

713
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,230
Speaker 3: Yeah, there are a few problems with the release.

714
00:44:42,331 --> 00:44:44,400
Speaker 3: I mean, it's not a perfect amazing release.

715
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:56,867
Speaker 3: However, Zeta Gundam is probably as far as I've been told I'm gonna watch it to find out the Gundam series period like the best one and This is the US release.

716
00:44:56,927 --> 00:44:59,940
Speaker 3: it's what you know and it's watchable, I mean, it's not the worst ever.

717
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:06,294
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see what I watch it because so far Much of the Gundam I've watched has been pretty bad, but I've watched you know f91.

718
00:45:06,334 --> 00:45:10,307
Speaker 0: Yeah Wing was actually pretty good.

719
00:45:10,367 --> 00:45:11,433
Speaker 0: I kind of enjoyed wing.

720
00:45:11,453 --> 00:45:12,940
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm seed was awesome.

721
00:45:13,141 --> 00:45:15,428
Speaker 0: Yeah, G Gundam can die in a fire.

722
00:45:15,468 --> 00:45:19,000
Speaker 3: G Gundam could die in two fires and a thousand fiery son.

723
00:45:19,201 --> 00:45:21,350
Speaker 0: My favorite gun him is still war in the pocket.

724
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:23,097
Speaker 3: Yeah, that was a good one.

725
00:45:23,138 --> 00:45:23,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was.

726
00:45:24,565 --> 00:45:25,310
Speaker 0: Of course it was.

727
00:45:25,813 --> 00:45:25,974
Speaker 3: no.

728
00:45:25,994 --> 00:45:29,913
Speaker 3: no my favorite though I think right now is like the eighth MS team.

729
00:45:29,933 --> 00:45:31,400
Speaker 3: still is that one?

730
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,562
Speaker 3: You know was just.

731
00:45:32,722 --> 00:45:38,540
Speaker 3: the robots were more like tanks and they were just generic war machines and it wasn't about robots at all.

732
00:45:39,021 --> 00:45:45,238
Speaker 3: You know Gundam seed would be my favorite but half the show was about robots and about you know, crazy Gundam stuff.

733
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:54,180
Speaker 0: Yeah Alright now right along with the dealers room is the artist alley Which every year is usually one of the highlights of my con experience.

734
00:45:55,127 --> 00:46:04,024
Speaker 0: Now before we talk about the artist alley I'm going to play a whole bunch of interviews done both by us and more importantly by our Correspondence in the field.

735
00:46:04,144 --> 00:46:05,989
Speaker 0: Kate and Adam aka art boy.

736
00:46:06,009 --> 00:46:11,564
Speaker 2: Hi, this is Kate correspondent for geek nights here at Otacon 2006.

737
00:46:11,564 --> 00:46:18,017
Speaker 2: I'm with chai otherwise known as Lianne PC here for chai.

738
00:46:18,098 --> 00:46:25,220
Speaker 2: chai Chai studios, okay We're talking today about her lovely artwork.

Speaker 2: Let me tell you the inking is amazing and I highly recommend you check out chai studios.

740
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:32,685
Speaker 2: comm Alright chai.

741
00:46:33,066 --> 00:46:34,912
Speaker 2: What kind of artwork you normally do?

742
00:46:34,932 --> 00:46:42,139
Speaker 2: I do a lot of mixture of Asian themes pieces and characters with more of a realistic feel to it.

743
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:50,550
Speaker 2: I love doing more old-school fantasy pirate artwork ninja artwork the whole Fun little based in history.

744
00:46:50,690 --> 00:47:00,504
Speaker 2: Yeah, but then taking it to a whole new extreme And it looks like you use an anime type style, but not No Doesn't nicely?

745
00:47:00,524 --> 00:47:03,700
Speaker 2: I end up getting a lot of people who are just like a fan art banner.

746
00:47:04,366 --> 00:47:05,799
Speaker 2: So I do play around a lot with that.

747
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:11,559
Speaker 2: But I was very influenced by Japanese anime and Japanese woodblock prints growing up.

748
00:47:11,961 --> 00:47:14,169
Speaker 2: So that has found a way into my style.

749
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:15,032
Speaker 2: Oh interesting.

750
00:47:15,052 --> 00:47:17,160
Speaker 2: Do you do any etching into the woodblock yourself?

751
00:47:17,825 --> 00:47:19,800
Speaker 2: Um, I actually do not do woodblock prints.

752
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:30,471
Speaker 2: I did do lithography for a while and I do actually do screen printing where I try the style of Wood blocks and do it on fabrics and clothing my fashion design.

753
00:47:30,972 --> 00:47:33,157
Speaker 2: Have you ever thought of bringing any of that to Otacon?

754
00:47:33,177 --> 00:47:38,697
Speaker 2: I Actually have not done that because a lot of people aren't quite so interested in original fashions at Oda.

755
00:47:38,717 --> 00:47:39,340
Speaker 2: Oh, really?

756
00:47:40,563 --> 00:47:43,860
Speaker 2: Is that the trend you think or is it just price issues?

757
00:47:44,826 --> 00:47:45,711
Speaker 2: I think it's price issues.

758
00:47:45,731 --> 00:47:51,280
Speaker 2: when you're a freelancer Kind of go with what is definitely price efficient and what you know will sell where you're at.

759
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:52,871
Speaker 2: So I actually bring a lot of that.

760
00:47:52,932 --> 00:48:06,900
Speaker 2: I do fashion shows in the New Haven and Boston area, so I always bring that stuff to those but I don't bring my Portfolio collection of anime themed artwork there either because they'd be like, um, how is this high couture?

761
00:48:08,493 --> 00:48:09,360
Speaker 2: That would be an issue.

762
00:48:10,061 --> 00:48:11,365
Speaker 2: Alright, so where are you from?

763
00:48:11,385 --> 00:48:18,772
Speaker 2: I'm actually currently located in western, Massachusetts in Ludlow, which is next to Springfield But I was a navy brat.

764
00:48:18,973 --> 00:48:19,840
Speaker 2: I'm from everywhere.

765
00:48:20,723 --> 00:48:22,060
Speaker 2: What cons do you frequent?

766
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,127
Speaker 2: Most of the New England ones.

767
00:48:24,227 --> 00:48:26,059
Speaker 2: I do anime Boston and Otacon every year.

768
00:48:26,722 --> 00:48:30,413
Speaker 2: I also do con bust and I did kinetic on for the first time this past year.

769
00:48:31,316 --> 00:48:32,740
Speaker 2: and how many Otacons have you been to?

770
00:48:33,821 --> 00:48:34,611
Speaker 2: I've been here.

771
00:48:34,631 --> 00:48:40,365
Speaker 2: I. I Have been attending Otacon since 1998 So quite a veteran.

772
00:48:40,646 --> 00:48:40,827
Speaker 2: Yep.

773
00:48:41,068 --> 00:48:42,694
Speaker 2: I only started doing artists alley.

774
00:48:42,734 --> 00:48:44,200
Speaker 2: However about two years ago.

775
00:48:45,702 --> 00:48:46,688
Speaker 2: So it's still new for me.

776
00:48:47,331 --> 00:48:48,296
Speaker 2: And do you take Commission?

777
00:48:48,316 --> 00:48:48,396
Speaker 2: I do.

778
00:48:49,561 --> 00:48:55,120
Speaker 2: What's the strangest and or most perverted and or silliest Commission request you've ever gotten?

779
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:00,919
Speaker 2: That would be for a zombie cow pirate in chibi form.

780
00:49:02,321 --> 00:49:04,729
Speaker 2: And did you complete the mission?

781
00:49:04,949 --> 00:49:08,380
Speaker 2: I did and I was quite amused because he informed me that the cow was also purple.

782
00:49:10,041 --> 00:49:11,526
Speaker 2: That's an odd request.

783
00:49:11,606 --> 00:49:14,577
Speaker 2: I'd have to say how much did it cost for that specific Commission?

784
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:16,261
Speaker 2: $10?

785
00:49:16,261 --> 00:49:17,304
Speaker 2: Okay.

786
00:49:17,384 --> 00:49:17,685
Speaker 2: Okay.

787
00:49:17,986 --> 00:49:20,092
Speaker 2: What's the most perverted request you've ever gotten?

788
00:49:20,112 --> 00:49:29,039
Speaker 2: I Am yeah, I'm doing a wife of venom piece right now.

789
00:49:31,423 --> 00:49:36,847
Speaker 2: Yes, it's the bathing suit is the venom Aspect from Marvel and like.

790
00:49:37,028 --> 00:49:39,679
Speaker 2: oh, it's very interesting very confusing to me.

791
00:49:40,301 --> 00:49:46,779
Speaker 2: Okay, but I see you do some yaoi and some shown and I that that is not exclusively what you do.

792
00:49:47,603 --> 00:49:49,600
Speaker 2: Do you find that that sells better at cons?

793
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:54,851
Speaker 2: And sometimes people at cons are always looking for their favorite pairings that they're never gonna see.

794
00:49:55,693 --> 00:50:03,111
Speaker 2: and I actually have two pairings that From Naruto that people never really see not even in doujinshi's.

795
00:50:03,412 --> 00:50:04,455
Speaker 2: and what pairing would that be?

796
00:50:04,976 --> 00:50:06,139
Speaker 2: Kakashi and Asama?

797
00:50:10,361 --> 00:50:12,540
Speaker 2: Yeah, so so for yaoi and shown in i-fans.

798
00:50:12,701 --> 00:50:17,640
Speaker 2: I think it's a really nice thing, but it's also nice that you mark it off and you give a warning.

799
00:50:17,981 --> 00:50:20,653
Speaker 2: So, you know your art is child friendly too.

800
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:22,260
Speaker 2: Just don't go into those sections.

801
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:25,213
Speaker 2: I have large Disney stickers covering up the center bit.

802
00:50:25,695 --> 00:50:31,400
Speaker 2: Haha interesting Have you ever had to draw a giant member a giant pulsating member?

803
00:50:32,441 --> 00:50:33,524
Speaker 2: No, I refuse those.

804
00:50:33,544 --> 00:50:35,069
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, you don't do those.

805
00:50:35,089 --> 00:50:41,580
Speaker 2: Um, I have a point where I'm like, okay, I'm sorry I think you'll be more better served by the tentacle porn down the.

806
00:50:42,822 --> 00:50:44,367
Speaker 2: So your integrity is not for sale.

807
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:45,791
Speaker 2: No, unfortunately not.

808
00:50:46,173 --> 00:50:46,534

827
00:51:57,331 --> 00:51:59,137
Speaker 2: So it's like a dual screen action.

00:51:59,158 --> 00:51:59,780
Speaker 2: You gotta go in there.

829
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:00,121

Speaker 1: it's not really hate.

861
00:53:18,224 --> 00:53:22,796
Speaker 2: it's a jab at everybody who takes Cosplaying way too seriously.

862
00:53:23,277 --> 00:53:27,110
Speaker 2: Can you give me an example of someone who took cosplaying way too seriously?

863
00:53:27,752 --> 00:53:31,415
Speaker 2: I don't know about too seriously But there's people who see it as as

Speaker 0: who need to lighten up and Realize

869
00:53:44,059 --> 00:53:44,521
Speaker 1: it's just

870
00:53:44,701 --> 00:53:45,465

881
00:54:35,191 --> 00:54:46,230
Speaker 2: So and right now I'm going to head over to the fan art Art show and head into the adult area and see what people there have to say because you know I'm going to go where no man has gone before.

882
00:54:47,694 --> 00:54:48,078
Speaker 2: All right.

883
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,110
Speaker 2: This is art boy.

884
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:58,689
Speaker 2: I have now entered the den of iniquity that we know as the adult area in the Otacon Art show and so far it's actually rather tame.

885
00:54:59,571 --> 00:55:01,842
Speaker 2: There's not a hell of a lot going on in here.

886
00:55:02,707 --> 00:55:05,661
Speaker 2: Hang on one second All right, this is a second take.

887
00:55:05,681 --> 00:55:06,525
Speaker 2: this is art boy.

888
00:55:06,565 --> 00:55:07,610
Speaker 2: You are Phil finder in the field.

889
00:55:08,112 --> 00:55:11,590
Speaker 2: I am currently walking through the adult art area at Otacon.

890
00:55:12,752 --> 00:55:16,930
Speaker 2: I entered expecting horrible horrible things, but really it's not that terrible.

891
00:55:18,772 --> 00:55:19,857
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's not a lot of.

892
00:55:19,877 --> 00:55:21,083
Speaker 2: there's a lot of pornography around.

893
00:55:21,143 --> 00:55:24,582
Speaker 2: it used your staff But what's your name?

894
00:55:24,864 --> 00:55:25,850
Speaker 0: Maxwell Maxwell?

895
00:55:27,212 --> 00:55:29,789
Speaker 2: Why do you think there's such a low turnout of a filth this year?

896
00:55:30,914 --> 00:55:32,710
Speaker 2: It just depends on which artists come.

897
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:36,503
Speaker 2: And would you say this is pretty tame compared to what we've seen in the past.

898
00:55:37,065 --> 00:55:38,070
Speaker 2: sex my first year kind.

899
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:39,399
Speaker 2: This is your first year at Otacon.

900
00:55:39,539 --> 00:55:39,922
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.

901
00:55:40,244 --> 00:55:41,069
Speaker 2: Oh, you know what you're missing.

902
00:55:42,491 --> 00:55:49,428
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that Somebody's been here before because I think that some of this artwork that would be considered the dope really isn't.

903
00:55:49,889 --> 00:55:50,913
Speaker 2: I mean We got.

904
00:55:50,933 --> 00:55:55,010
Speaker 2: we have some Final Fantasy characters here who are really just holding towels in front of them.

905
00:55:55,411 --> 00:55:58,160
Speaker 2: It's suggestive it just hold towels if I'm looking terrible.

906
00:55:58,622 --> 00:56:01,110
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's a new yosh character lounging in a bed.

907
00:56:01,652 --> 00:56:05,350
Speaker 2: There's one thing that's selling for like $500 that looks like the frame cost more than the artwork.

908
00:56:05,431 --> 00:56:06,744
Speaker 2: I mean, it's just sort of sad.

909
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:10,149
Speaker 2: I don't see if I can find anybody who's into this kind of thing trying to interview them.

910
00:56:10,471 --> 00:56:14,090
Speaker 2: You know, sometimes if you see an artwork, there's a minimum bid very high.

911
00:56:14,331 --> 00:56:16,438
Speaker 2: It could just be the artist is you know what not for sale.

912
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:17,822
Speaker 2: put a minimum bid.

913
00:56:18,545 --> 00:56:19,247
Speaker 2: That's true.

914
00:56:19,307 --> 00:56:20,110
Speaker 2: That's a good idea.

915
00:56:21,271 --> 00:56:23,780
Speaker 2: So tell me you're here in the adult area of Otacon.

916
00:56:24,503 --> 00:56:25,567
Speaker 2: What brought you into this area?

917
00:56:25,587 --> 00:56:26,410
Speaker 2: What were you hoping to find?

918
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:40,810
Speaker 2: Because last year they actually had a few that were pretty good, but it's only that's as much as last year I guess normally Past I have come in here and it's just been like a den of iniquity full of filth of all imaginable kinds.

919
00:56:41,091 --> 00:56:43,218
Speaker 2: Yeah, would you say this year sort of a disappointing turnout?

920
00:56:43,398 --> 00:56:48,450
Speaker 2: Yes a little bit like they're good, but last year There's just so much variety.

921
00:56:48,911 --> 00:56:52,002
Speaker 2: Were you looking for something specific this year or just whatever tickled your fancy?

922
00:56:52,103 --> 00:56:53,327
Speaker 2: Yeah browsing.

923
00:56:53,768 --> 00:56:55,233
Speaker 2: All right, cool I'm gonna keep on looking around.

924
00:56:55,555 --> 00:56:57,702
Speaker 2: you have anything to say about the turnout this year for the?

925
00:56:58,405 --> 00:57:01,854
Speaker 2: for the adult area I'm a little disappointed.

926
00:57:02,516 --> 00:57:08,386
Speaker 2: I love hentai and I I just see one that I would really think of buying just because it's two bondage girls.

927
00:57:09,251 --> 00:57:10,837
Speaker 2: What do you think about these Final Fantasy ones?

928
00:57:10,857 --> 00:57:12,885
Speaker 2: I mean, would you classify those as really adults?

929
00:57:13,287 --> 00:57:17,907
Speaker 2: Not really because First of all, I don't like guy hentai.

930
00:57:18,931 --> 00:57:22,218
Speaker 2: second of all They're not naked.

931
00:57:22,238 --> 00:57:31,100
Speaker 0: I Is good the Good But you know, no and no nudity.

932
00:57:31,663 --> 00:57:31,843
Speaker 2: Yeah.

933
00:57:31,883 --> 00:57:41,980
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's pretty tame in the news here And even we even have a Rama looks like a Rama one-half inked on rice paper on which there are No nipples and no sex going on either.

934
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,130
Speaker 2: Oh, just she's kind of riding Rama.

935
00:57:48,353 --> 00:57:52,550
Speaker 2: All right, let's see if anybody else is anything to say here in the the adult section.

936
00:57:52,570 --> 00:58:01,976
Speaker 2: let's see we have a suggestive Oscar seen that a thousand times and Wow, there are numerous numerous panels that are completely Completely empty.

937
00:58:02,741 --> 00:58:04,209
Speaker 3: What are your feelings on the empty panels here?

938
00:58:05,412 --> 00:58:11,401
Speaker 2: We could have drawn it Gravitation gravitation.

939
00:58:11,623 --> 00:58:23,273
Speaker 2: Yeah Sean and I are if you're looking for mega mix that Before.

940
00:58:23,293 --> 00:58:27,861
Speaker 2: yeah What's last year's compared to this year's much better.

941
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:29,670
Speaker 2: they had way more stuff way more stuff.

942
00:58:29,857 --> 00:58:37,090
Speaker 2: Yeah Would you say that that you normally find things that are also more suggestive and if I may more filthy here?

943
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:41,030
Speaker 2: Because I think that what I've seen coming from an art background is pretty tame.

944
00:58:43,631 --> 00:58:51,235
Speaker 2: Think it's like sort of marginally because people still like to keep it pretty like I find like more like I mean More the hardwood stuff.

945
00:58:51,295 --> 00:58:52,761
Speaker 2: It's just like in the dojinshi.

946
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:55,130
Speaker 2: You don't really see it a lot on the like the walls.

947
00:58:55,311 --> 00:58:58,164
Speaker 2: If they had a couple of hardwood pieces last year, but definitely this year.

948
00:58:58,184 --> 00:59:01,317
Speaker 2: It's totally flat like This stuff might as well be outside.

949
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:02,963
Speaker 2: Yeah, I see walking around here.

950
00:59:03,003 --> 00:59:04,810
Speaker 2: I see like it's like a full.

951
00:59:05,051 --> 00:59:07,101
Speaker 2: There's a full display that is empty.

952
00:59:07,462 --> 00:59:08,648
Speaker 2: There's another full display.

953
00:59:08,688 --> 00:59:16,345
Speaker 2: That is Mostly empty as there are a couple of framed things which aren't I'd say are more suggestive.

954
00:59:16,406 --> 00:59:21,410
Speaker 2: as opposed to a doll This could be like out on the out on the tables.

955
00:59:23,171 --> 00:59:24,215
Speaker 2: There there are three.

956
00:59:24,235 --> 00:59:35,145
Speaker 2: there are three completely empty displays and all in all a pretty sad showing Pretty pretty sad showing and a disappointment to a hand-tied pants everywhere.

957
00:59:35,245 --> 00:59:43,652
Speaker 2: if I might go so far This has been our boy your fill finder in the field for Otakon 2006.

958
00:59:43,652 --> 00:59:46,990
Speaker 3: Wow, I never listened to those interviews and you know, I still haven't listened to them.

959
00:59:47,171 --> 00:59:47,572
Speaker 0: You know what?

960
00:59:47,813 --> 00:59:49,119
Speaker 0: I didn't really listen to them either.

961
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:59,231
Speaker 0: I listened through them a little bit while I Man mashed the absolute hell out of them to make them not sound bad because that Sony recording bit is starting to become my arch Enemy.

962
00:59:59,733 --> 01:00:03,205
Speaker 3: Ram and Scott are not responsible for the content of the interviews.

963
01:00:03,225 --> 01:00:03,948
Speaker 3: You just listened to.

964
01:00:04,389 --> 01:00:08,291
Speaker 0: yes I mean I trust Kate and Adam very much and I'm pretty sure the inner I mean.

965
01:00:08,311 --> 01:00:22,506
Speaker 0: I skimmed through them and it seemed like they interviewed some really interesting funny people and I like Adams a filth finding mission Very much Despite the fact that he dropped and broke my Sony ICD p320.

966
01:00:22,546 --> 01:00:22,867
Speaker 0: good.

967
01:00:23,148 --> 01:00:23,750
Speaker 3: It deserved it.

968
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:25,014
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

969
01:00:25,094 --> 01:00:25,877
Speaker 0: It didn't deserve it.

970
01:00:26,278 --> 01:00:27,201
Speaker 0: Sony deserved it.

971
01:00:27,522 --> 01:00:29,870
Speaker 0: This is like the poor crippled kid that Sony crippled.

972
01:00:30,211 --> 01:00:34,644
Speaker 0: This could have been such an awesome piece of hardware and Sony's DRM ruined it.

973
01:00:34,864 --> 01:00:41,942
Speaker 2: Yeah, speaking of DRM As an IT professional DRM can blow me outstanding.

974
01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:46,055
Speaker 2: I agree with that.

975
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:49,090
Speaker 0: How many of us are IT professionals or computer programmers?

976
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:51,431
Speaker 2: Who's?

977
01:00:51,492 --> 01:00:52,418
Speaker 2: who's the Neil Luddite?

978
01:00:53,224 --> 01:01:26,707
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah scientists Where I work here in Baltimore We do not allow iTunes installed because of the DRM will actually cause problems with the machine setups because the DRM is running in the background and we have Certain software on the machines that let us know what the fuck people are doing and that DRM will actually Cause that software that we built ourselves to go.

979
01:01:26,727 --> 01:01:33,627
Speaker 2: no good so We've actually figured out a way around it.

980
01:01:33,687 --> 01:01:46,589
Speaker 2: I can't say what it is because I want to keep my job But we struggled for about a year with this with the Apple DRM and we're running into other issues now with DRM because now we're recording meetings

981
01:01:47,192 --> 01:01:47,473
Speaker 0: and we're

982
01:01:47,553 --> 01:01:59,558
Speaker 2: actually doing video casts and I work for a subsidiary of a very very very fucking large Multinational corporation and the DRM of other products is causing problems with our in-house

983
01:01:59,578 --> 01:01:59,859
Speaker 0: stuff.

984
01:02:00,848 --> 01:02:03,385
Speaker 0: that was from our Geek nights meet up.

985
01:02:03,526 --> 01:02:11,920
Speaker 0: a few of our listeners and some of our front row crew members had some things to say about DRM after an argument that had broken out in our forums a while ago about it.

986
01:02:12,321 --> 01:02:13,867
Speaker 3: Anyway back to the artists alley.

987
01:02:13,988 --> 01:02:14,289
Speaker 0: Yes.

988
01:02:14,349 --> 01:02:16,377
Speaker 3: Yeah, the artists alley this year.

989
01:02:16,397 --> 01:02:17,040
Speaker 3: It was pretty good.

990
01:02:17,261 --> 01:02:21,640
Speaker 0: I mean, I was very much impressed with the caliber of art in the artists alley itself.

991
01:02:21,801 --> 01:02:22,990
Speaker 0: It seemed to be above average.

992
01:02:23,272 --> 01:02:24,320
Speaker 3: It was definitely above average.

993
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:33,316
Speaker 3: Also, the artists alley was really big and the layout was really good and they get people got a lot of table space but there were some empty tables in the back corner.

994
01:02:33,377 --> 01:02:45,800
Speaker 3: now, I realized the artists alley did sell out when they first allowed signups and Because some people didn't pay or you know copped out that it left empty tables that were not filled.

995
01:02:46,052 --> 01:02:55,827
Speaker 0: Yep now the thing is there are quite a bit more cop-outs than usual and my best guess is that one after the whole OMG Otakon is banning fan art.

996
01:02:56,048 --> 01:03:00,180
Speaker 3: lol riot that happened and then that might have had a small effect.

997
01:03:00,542 --> 01:03:04,964
Speaker 3: Yeah, like I don't think because I don't think the news of that was that widespread It was.

998
01:03:04,984 --> 01:03:12,849
Speaker 0: but the the thing that I wanted to mention that about is that I noticed who was Conspicuously absent from the artist alley this year.

999
01:03:13,852 --> 01:03:25,920
Speaker 0: all those artists who just mass manufacturer basically traced things or Naruto headbands are generally all the people who kind of say the Naruto headband manufacturers were not there.

1000
01:03:26,341 --> 01:03:29,272
Speaker 0: Oh, no, there was a guy making him but he wasn't making Naruto once.

1001
01:03:29,312 --> 01:03:31,299
Speaker 0: he was making just weird funny custom ones.

1002
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:35,950
Speaker 3: Ah Aha, but there were the people who made like the hats.

1003
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:36,934
Speaker 3: remember those people.

1004
01:03:37,014 --> 01:03:38,500
Speaker 3: Yeah, they were in the dealers room.

1005
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:39,042
Speaker 3: They moved.

1006
01:03:39,062 --> 01:03:40,086
Speaker 3: they actually made a company.

1007
01:03:40,106 --> 01:03:40,809
Speaker 3: they moved on up.

1008
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:43,880
Speaker 3: Yeah, so yeah, there were a bunch of people absent.

1009
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:52,460
Speaker 3: however I do think that they if you notice the time when they announced that there are a bunch of cop-outs and openings Was real close to the con.

1010
01:03:52,560 --> 01:04:02,240
Speaker 3: I think they should have had the deadline for paying up and you know You know not copping out a little earlier to give people who you know might have been on the waiting list more.

1011
01:04:04,003 --> 01:04:09,740
Speaker 0: We were offered as geek nights a table in the artists alley Just because we had a panel and we could use it for geek nights.

1012
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:16,577
Speaker 0: We decided early on that we didn't want it Because we figured we didn't want to deny an artist a chance to be in the alley.

1013
01:04:16,718 --> 01:04:16,879
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

1014
01:04:17,321 --> 01:04:19,328
Speaker 0: And then the artist alley sold out.

1015
01:04:19,369 --> 01:04:22,359
Speaker 0: so we felt very justified and smug in our altruistic decision.

1016
01:04:23,322 --> 01:04:30,840
Speaker 0: Then right before the con we find out oh noes There are artists alleys tables and by then it was totally too late for us to put together a geek nights thing.

1017
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:36,380
Speaker 3: Yeah, it's like if the artists alley sells out right the freaking day you open it for sign ups.

1018
01:04:36,922 --> 01:04:43,596
Speaker 3: You should require that everyone cough up the money within a couple, you know Maybe three to four weeks if they haven't paid up.

1019
01:04:43,637 --> 01:04:47,800
Speaker 3: by then You got a clear amount and have a waiting list and all that good stuff.

1020
01:04:48,101 --> 01:04:52,859
Speaker 0: Seems that Otakon generally is very very forgiving of stupidity among its members.

1021
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:54,183
Speaker 3: Yeah I mean they stopped.

1022
01:04:54,384 --> 01:05:07,470
Speaker 3: basically what they do is instead of having like smart systems and forcing people into them They just try to make it so simple that there's less you can be stupid with, you know They eliminated group memberships, which was a great thing.

1023
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:13,140
Speaker 0: group memberships have caused nothing but problems at any con ever Yeah, but they only cause problems because of stupidity.

1024
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:17,500
Speaker 3: So rather than force people to be smart or punish them for being dumb.

1025
01:05:17,841 --> 01:05:24,691
Speaker 0: They just eliminate your chance to be dumb, you know, well with the group discounts It's not just that it screws stupid people.

1026
01:05:25,333 --> 01:05:26,980
Speaker 0: smart people also screw Otakon.

1027
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:28,264
Speaker 0: Just think about it.

1028
01:05:28,284 --> 01:05:31,258
Speaker 0: You just go in the forum find ten people are all going to.

1029
01:05:31,318 --> 01:05:32,684
Speaker 3: oh, yeah That's a separate issue.

1030
01:05:32,724 --> 01:05:36,900
Speaker 3: But you see I'm talking about the general, you know dealing with stupid people.

1031
01:05:37,121 --> 01:05:42,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, well thing is it seems like Otakon will always put forth the maximum effort to help anyone.

1032
01:05:42,479 --> 01:05:44,680
Speaker 3: Yeah I mean which is which is good and bad.

1033
01:05:44,810 --> 01:05:55,796
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean if one I see a lot of cases where like one person screws up their registration and The staff the high-level staffers will personally track down what happened and then email the person back right away.

1034
01:05:55,816 --> 01:06:03,500
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and All I can say is that Otakon has some of the most dedicated and amazing staff of any convention I've ever been to.

1035
01:06:03,801 --> 01:06:07,399
Speaker 3: Yeah, I think it's a great policy to help anyone who has any amount of trouble.

1036
01:06:07,841 --> 01:06:10,512
Speaker 3: However, I do not think that you should it.

1037
01:06:10,572 --> 01:06:26,991
Speaker 3: there's a line at which you say, okay We can't give you any more personal help beyond this level because then it would be denying someone else of something, you know And you know trying to give someone that extra Excessive amount of time to pay for their artists.

1038
01:06:27,111 --> 01:06:29,940
Speaker 3: alley is keeping someone else out of the alley, you know.

1039
01:06:30,061 --> 01:06:30,644
Speaker 3: And there's like.

1040
01:06:30,665 --> 01:06:32,839
Speaker 3: you got to put a deadline and say that's it, you know.

1041
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:42,652
Speaker 3: Yeah, I mean if you really want set a deadline and then the real deadline is a week later You know to allow for the latecomers, I think they do that too.

1042
01:06:42,873 --> 01:06:43,194
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1043
01:06:43,394 --> 01:06:44,980
Speaker 3: Yeah, but you get my point.

1044
01:06:45,161 --> 01:06:45,885
Speaker 0: Yeah, I get your point.

1045
01:06:46,488 --> 01:06:48,920
Speaker 0: But despite that I mean the caliber of art was amazing.

1046
01:06:49,081 --> 01:06:51,069
Speaker 0: I was very impressed with a lot of the artists.

1047
01:06:51,129 --> 01:06:53,660
Speaker 0: I saw I took a whole bunch of business cards.

1048
01:06:53,821 --> 01:07:01,599
Speaker 0: I plan to commission several of the artists I met later on Even though the one person I wanted to commission the most said that she doesn't take commissions.

1049
01:07:02,041 --> 01:07:03,526
Speaker 3: How could you not take commissions?

1050
01:07:03,606 --> 01:07:08,965
Speaker 0: It was it was the girl who had those that black metal work stuff I wanted all right.

1051
01:07:09,045 --> 01:07:13,300
Speaker 0: I wanted a full-size utenna rose that I could put in my window.

1052
01:07:13,601 --> 01:07:20,638
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, like just the full, you know, the black like silhouetted utenna rose Yeah, and she explained that she doesn't do commissions and I didn't have a chance to.

1053
01:07:20,658 --> 01:07:22,867
Speaker 0: you know Try to convince her otherwise, so maybe I'll try later.

1054
01:07:22,887 --> 01:07:24,916
Speaker 3: Uh, did you get her website or whatever?

1055
01:07:24,976 --> 01:07:25,940
Speaker 0: I have her business card.

1056
01:07:26,382 --> 01:07:29,078
Speaker 3: Yeah, the art show was also pretty cool.

1057
01:07:29,199 --> 01:07:34,820
Speaker 0: Yes You see I was worried because all the cons I've gone to this year so far had pretty mediocre art shows.

1058
01:07:35,082 --> 01:07:36,595
Speaker 3: Basically no art show to speak of.

1059
01:07:36,999 --> 01:07:42,255
Speaker 0: yeah But even the ones that had an art show they just there were a lot of those bootleg kind of look.

1060
01:07:42,295 --> 01:07:44,020
Speaker 0: someone traced a cell.

1061
01:07:44,482 --> 01:07:45,325
Speaker 0: Oh, wow.

1062
01:07:45,385 --> 01:07:46,871
Speaker 0: You're such a talented artist.

1063
01:07:47,253 --> 01:08:04,553
Speaker 3: Yeah, the art show at Otacon this year, you know They didn't fill up all of the space they had for it with art Which is you know, it makes the art show look smaller than it is because you have all these empty spaces Which is good because that way the art show can be as big as it needs to be But it also it makes it feel small when it's not.

1064
01:08:04,614 --> 01:08:05,317
Speaker 3: you know what I'm saying?

1065
01:08:05,779 --> 01:08:08,735
Speaker 3: Yeah Anyway, there was lots of awesome arts in there.

1066
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:13,100
Speaker 0: Yep of note There were these power of girls things that I've been on all of them and I was outbid.

1067
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:15,920
Speaker 3: There was a little Phoenix right in a frame that I bid on and lost.

1068
01:08:16,442 --> 01:08:19,899
Speaker 0: There was a kid Koopa being beaten up by all the other Koopa kids.

1069
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,654
Speaker 0: That was awesome and I bid quite a bit of money and yet I was outbid.

1070
01:08:23,834 --> 01:08:25,340
Speaker 0: Yep, but I bought the print.

1071
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:26,626
Speaker 0: I'm very happy.

1072
01:08:26,908 --> 01:08:39,560
Speaker 3: Yeah, speaking of that kid Koopa print there were Two artists in the artists alley that were quite particularly awesome And I want to give them the mad props mostly because they stay drew sketches in the pirate book.

1073
01:08:40,041 --> 01:08:40,884
Speaker 0: Oh the pirate book.

1074
01:08:40,924 --> 01:08:43,171
Speaker 0: for anyone who isn't aware of our pirate book.

1075
01:08:43,212 --> 01:08:45,901
Speaker 0: This was Scott's idea and he is its minder Mm-hmm.

1076
01:08:46,363 --> 01:08:49,955
Speaker 3: I got a blank sketchbook and I'm gonna take it to all the conventions.

1077
01:08:50,336 --> 01:09:00,299
Speaker 3: and at the conventions I go to the cool artists the particularly awesome ones and I say Will you draw anything you want as long as it is piratey in some way in this book?

1078
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:03,754
Speaker 3: and Eventually, this book will be full of piratey goodness.

1079
01:09:04,457 --> 01:09:08,102
Speaker 3: so far I think most of our artsy friends have drawn something in it Have they?

1080
01:09:08,182 --> 01:09:11,013
Speaker 0: we forgot to ask almost everyone during the week of awesome there.

1081
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:12,859
Speaker 3: a few of them did and a few of them did.

1082
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:15,332
Speaker 3: Not you know, it's not like we're not gonna see them again.

1083
01:09:15,393 --> 01:09:16,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not hard to track down.

1084
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:27,630
Speaker 3: There are if there are friends they're gonna draw something in it and if you know But you know the rest of the pages have I think there's like three or four friends who still have to do it and then From then on it's all I got to say.

1085
01:09:27,670 --> 01:09:29,479
Speaker 0: the best thing in that book is still that bone beard.

1086
01:09:29,621 --> 01:09:31,420
Speaker 3: Yeah, okay a bone beard.

1087
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:39,689
Speaker 3: It was drawn by the guy who did your kid Koopa and he also did the print I bought from him Which was like Galactus verse.

1088
01:09:39,872 --> 01:09:40,999
Speaker 0: I forgot about that.

1089
01:09:41,462 --> 01:09:48,580
Speaker 3: It's got Galactus and then it has you know The Katamari king of the universe guy and then it has the silver surfer and a little Katamari.

1090
01:09:48,843 --> 01:09:52,604
Speaker 3: It's sort of like this, you know It's very well done.

1091
01:09:52,685 --> 01:09:54,411
Speaker 3: Yes, that guy's name that awesome.

1092
01:09:54,511 --> 01:09:57,180
Speaker 3: Awesome guy who drew bone beard the ghost.

1093
01:09:57,381 --> 01:09:58,526
Speaker 3: I guess that's what we're calling him.

1094
01:09:58,767 --> 01:10:00,916
Speaker 0: Well, he has a bone beard of little bones.

1095
01:10:01,157 --> 01:10:01,960
Speaker 3: I know it's so great.

1096
01:10:02,041 --> 01:10:03,676
Speaker 3: I'm gonna scan it in and put it on the internet.

1097
01:10:05,101 --> 01:10:13,960
Speaker 3: His name is Brandon Kramer and his website is Brando k.com br a and D. Okay, ay dot-com and it's awesome.

1098
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:19,760
Speaker 3: You can actually see the kid Koopa and the Galactus and stuff on his website on some section on there.

1099
01:10:20,801 --> 01:10:23,032
Speaker 3: The other awesome person who was an awesome artist.

1100
01:10:23,293 --> 01:10:29,735
Speaker 3: I was in the art show And there was this whole section full of these incredibly cute pay like illustrations.

1101
01:10:29,835 --> 01:10:34,078
Speaker 3: It was just like oh my god Like every single one of them was like, oh my god.

1102
01:10:37,202 --> 01:10:45,500
Speaker 0: And I look that would that for those of you who think Scott is just this horrible Crotchety asshole that is a side of Scott you rarely see.

1103
01:10:46,922 --> 01:10:48,128
Speaker 3: And I was you know, it was.

1104
01:10:48,329 --> 01:10:48,992
Speaker 3: I realized.

1105
01:10:49,032 --> 01:10:50,680
Speaker 3: hey all of these are by the same part.

1106
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:53,860
Speaker 3: Well, it's not hard to tell they were all by the same person, but they were too awesome.

1107
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:57,960
Speaker 0: Just the way she draws her eyes just really sets her characters off.

1108
01:10:58,043 --> 01:11:15,694
Speaker 3: Yeah It wasn't your typical anime art and the quality was like ten steps above just about everything else there in terms of skill Involved and everything, you know, and I looked and the name on all of it was Katie Osoyeki, I don't know how to pronounce the last name and I'm sure

1109
01:11:15,754 --> 01:11:15,995
Speaker 1: she'll

1110
01:11:16,015 --> 01:11:21,603
Speaker 3: forgive us but Osoyeki, whatever.

1111
01:11:22,567 --> 01:11:23,871
Speaker 3: and I was like, oh my god.

1112
01:11:23,911 --> 01:11:25,256
Speaker 3: I wonder if that person is here.

1113
01:11:25,336 --> 01:11:26,199
Speaker 3: Well, they must be here.

1114
01:11:26,742 --> 01:11:32,767
Speaker 3: So I went over to the artist alley info booth and I said does Katie Osoyeki have a table?

1115
01:11:33,228 --> 01:11:34,152
Speaker 3: and sure enough she did.

1116
01:11:34,513 --> 01:11:45,314
Speaker 3: so I went to find her and she was awesome and She drew a little girl in the buyer book that goes are I'm a pirate And she has a little parrot and whatever it is quite high quality.

1117
01:11:45,414 --> 01:11:47,000
Speaker 3: Yeah, I'll scan it and put on the internet also.

1118
01:11:48,022 --> 01:11:48,807
Speaker 3: She is too awesome.

1119
01:11:48,827 --> 01:11:55,332
Speaker 3: You can go to her website, which is Katie o katie o dot k?

1120
01:11:55,572 --> 01:11:57,457
Speaker 3: u i ki dot net.

01:11:57,557 --> 01:12:01,276
Speaker 3: she also has a Deviant art which you can find if you just search for Katie.

1122
01:12:01,377 --> 01:12:02,686
Speaker 0: Oh Yep.

1123
01:12:02,787 --> 01:12:04,600
Speaker 0: Also our friend Carla was in the artist alley.

1124
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:06,086
Speaker 0: Our friend cat was in the artist alley.

1125
01:12:06,548 --> 01:12:09,340
Speaker 0: our friend Brian Carroll of instant classic was in the artist alley.

1126
01:12:10,323 --> 01:12:20,118
Speaker 0: Our friend I do who does fallen was in the artist alley sharing a table with our good friend Nury who does Artist Ally the podcast and she was selling her awesome dice jewelry.

1127
01:12:20,259 --> 01:12:28,100
Speaker 0: Yes She came up like killing selling dice jewelry at an amazement and she started like making dice jewelry.

1128
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:29,304
Speaker 0: That's exactly what it is.

1129
01:12:29,324 --> 01:12:31,291
Speaker 0: Like little earring with a d8 or a pen.

1130
01:12:31,551 --> 01:12:33,117
Speaker 0: Scott Johnson bought the best piece.

1131
01:12:33,177 --> 01:12:39,038
Speaker 0: It's a d30 Just like on this bling chain, it's basically a black rope with a d30.

1132
01:12:39,078 --> 01:12:42,334
Speaker 0: at the end of it It looks like such a 70s swinger thing.

1133
01:12:42,454 --> 01:12:43,258
Speaker 3: It does it's.

1134
01:12:43,298 --> 01:12:46,467
Speaker 3: so It's not really something you want to wear.

1135
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:48,453
Speaker 3: I mean, I maybe a d20 I would wear on a shorter rope.

1136
01:12:51,383 --> 01:12:53,379
Speaker 0: I think the thing Scott Johnson bought is great.

1137
01:12:54,343 --> 01:12:55,066
Speaker 3: It's great for him.

1138
01:12:55,850 --> 01:12:57,838
Speaker 3: He's got a giant hairy chest like a 70s swinger.

1139
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:08,415
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is I think that is the perfect because if you go to a club wearing like a 70s shirt With the top unbuttoned a bit and wearing that around your neck that that'll be the awesome.

1140
01:13:08,496 --> 01:13:13,192
Speaker 0: because if any girl Talks to you despite that she is cool guaranteed.

1141
01:13:13,292 --> 01:13:18,170
Speaker 3: or if a girl comes up and says she knows what it is Like why do you have a d30 on your neck then?

1142
01:13:18,290 --> 01:13:18,993
Speaker 3: That's the one.

1143
01:13:19,094 --> 01:13:20,700
Speaker 3: see you once he's like, what's that?

1144
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:21,763
Speaker 3: Those are not the ones.

1145
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:22,224
Speaker 0: Yep.

1146
01:13:22,425 --> 01:13:22,746
Speaker 0: You want to.

1147
01:13:23,087 --> 01:13:25,976
Speaker 0: why does that dice not have dots on it?

1148
01:13:26,076 --> 01:13:27,220
Speaker 0: Why does it have numbers?

1149
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:37,371
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyone who knows, you know die notation really really really is a cool person Mm-hmm, but she was telling these things left and right.

1150
01:13:37,411 --> 01:13:37,933
Speaker 0: good God.

1151
01:13:38,174 --> 01:13:40,000
Speaker 3: Okay, so artist Ally was awesome.

1152
01:13:40,402 --> 01:13:42,213
Speaker 1: I spent a lot of time there as did.

1153
01:13:42,274 --> 01:13:43,240
Speaker 1: I didn't get tired of it.

1154
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,200
Speaker 1: I just kept walking around finding new awesome thing.

1155
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:49,940
Speaker 0: In fact Sunday after we'd completely lost our voices we ran into a girl who was doing caricatures there.

1156
01:13:50,021 --> 01:13:53,120
Speaker 0: She works at some amusement park and she's an anime fan.

1157
01:13:53,200 --> 01:14:01,660
Speaker 0: so she did I forget her name or I'd plug her but she decided to do anime type caricatures and We didn't really get to talk to her so much and I wanted to interview her.

1158
01:14:02,322 --> 01:14:04,168
Speaker 0: Neither one of us could actually talk.

1159
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:09,867
Speaker 0: so we kind of stood there and gestured as she talked to us for a while Yep, so that was artist Ally.

1160
01:14:10,168 --> 01:14:11,612
Speaker 1: Yes in the video game room.

1161
01:14:12,234 --> 01:14:13,337
Speaker 1: We talked about that yesterday.

1162
01:14:13,357 --> 01:14:14,220
Speaker 1: So we're skipping over that.

1163
01:14:14,541 --> 01:14:17,893
Speaker 0: Yep, if you want to hear our coverage of gaming at Otakon check out yesterday's episode.

1164
01:14:18,133 --> 01:14:20,404
Speaker 1: Okay, let's talk about the showings now.

1165
01:14:20,485 --> 01:14:27,220
Speaker 0: the only thing I Actually watch at Otakon was Osamu Tezuka's porno.

1166
01:14:28,404 --> 01:14:38,700
Speaker 0: It was well, it's not really pornographic It was just it was in the over 18 showings and many people call it a hentai though It's more just an erotically charged animation.

1167
01:14:38,765 --> 01:14:45,221
Speaker 1: Yes It's called Belladonna and is not something that's easy to get or see and I wish I would have known about it because I would have gone To it.

1168
01:14:45,402 --> 01:14:53,588
Speaker 0: I watched a good 15 minutes of it and with Adam art boy, and it was really cool and I really kind of want to see it.

1169
01:14:53,949 --> 01:14:54,591
Speaker 0: in total.

1170
01:14:54,671 --> 01:15:00,490
Speaker 0: the problem was it was raw and My knowledge of Japanese extends to say is raw.

1171
01:15:00,711 --> 01:15:01,674
Speaker 0: It was raw.

1172
01:15:02,035 --> 01:15:02,999
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't know that.

1173
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:11,043
Speaker 0: luckily my knowledge of anime Japanese is good enough to where I kind of figured out what was going on and that there was a Demon.

1174
01:15:11,706 --> 01:15:18,498
Speaker 0: and because I kept the eye, you know when you're an anime fan There's words you hear all the time and I heard a lot of those words.

1175
01:15:19,442 --> 01:15:21,551
Speaker 0: So I could kind of figure out what was going on.

1176
01:15:21,993 --> 01:15:30,299
Speaker 0: and in terms of actual Japanese The only thing I can understand at all is dogs and cats and saying what their names are or whether or not I own them.

1177
01:15:31,981 --> 01:15:35,090
Speaker 0: There were no dogs, but someone was something at some point.

1178
01:15:35,832 --> 01:15:37,617
Speaker 0: Okay, and someone said someone's name.

1179
01:15:37,637 --> 01:15:41,071
Speaker 1: I Watched three things at Otacon.

1180
01:15:41,091 --> 01:15:43,080
Speaker 1: They were all live-action Asian movies.

1181
01:15:43,722 --> 01:15:45,869
Speaker 1: The first one is Lady Terminator, which I saw.

1182
01:15:45,869 --> 01:15:49,280
Speaker 1: 80% of Lady Terminator is a bad movie.

1183
01:15:49,421 --> 01:15:52,213
Speaker 0: She mates and then she terminates.

1184
01:15:52,394 --> 01:15:53,520
Speaker 1: that is the tagline.

1185
01:15:54,180 --> 01:16:10,304
Speaker 1: basically, you have like this 80s chick just kind of walking around shooting people and occasionally she'll trick some guy into having sex with her and Basically the guy just gets like this blood bukkake face and dies Blood bukkake.

1186
01:16:10,645 --> 01:16:16,760
Speaker 1: I think there was some sort of snake in her snatch that bit the guys and caused the blood bukkake to happen.

1187
01:16:16,861 --> 01:16:25,538
Speaker 1: I'm not sure but the movie is basically some Detective guys cobs running around trying to fight this 80s terminator.

1188
01:16:25,558 --> 01:16:34,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever It was pretty lame But right after it we I watched art of the devil - and you don't need to see art of the devil one.

1189
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:41,379
Speaker 1: to see art of the devil - Because art of the devil - was just sort of like this horror gross-out movie and you know what?

1190
01:16:41,982 --> 01:16:44,712
Speaker 1: Compared to things like ichi the killer it was

1191
01:16:44,832 --> 01:16:45,274
Speaker 3: tame

1192
01:16:45,615 --> 01:17:05,165
Speaker 1: but compared to 99% of movies out there this had some pretty gory scenes the best among which was when one guy had Propane torch put to him while he was sedated with muscle relaxants and all of his flesh was basically completely burned off especially on his legs.

1193
01:17:05,848 --> 01:17:12,980
Speaker 1: and then the lady took a washcloth and basically Wiped the flesh off his leg and you saw a bone and everything.

1194
01:17:14,621 --> 01:17:20,437
Speaker 0: At this point, I think I was wandering around with Adam somewhat intoxicated interviewing people at the rave.

1195
01:17:20,838 --> 01:17:25,572
Speaker 1: Yeah, and That's a good movie to go see if you're liking the ultra violence in the gore.

1196
01:17:25,772 --> 01:17:28,259
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, the horror wasn't too.

1197
01:17:29,944 --> 01:17:32,260
Speaker 0: That was really the best tasteless movie this year.

1198
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:41,491
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not really gonna summarize the plot of it because the plot is just kind of whatever but yeah There were some gory scenes that were pleasant for if you like gore.

1199
01:17:42,053 --> 01:17:44,280
Speaker 1: Yep, and the last movie I saw was sex inferior.

1200
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:45,666
Speaker 1: I didn't see the whole thing base.

1201
01:17:45,726 --> 01:17:48,719
Speaker 1: I waited a while to see it because I had high expectations.

1202
01:17:48,859 --> 01:17:50,716
Speaker 0: now Meanwhile, they had been pushed back.

1203
01:17:51,422 --> 01:17:53,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, this time was the day changed the time on it.

1204
01:17:53,781 --> 01:18:00,600
Speaker 0: So a good half of the crew was waiting for this movie and I showed up and once again I was somewhat intoxicated because it was late at night.

1205
01:18:00,821 --> 01:18:06,520
Speaker 0: And yeah, so they're all waiting to watch this movie and I come over and I decide that it is not worth it.

1206
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:11,214
Speaker 0: So I went back to the room to record what ended up being the webcomics roundtable instead.

1207
01:18:11,234 --> 01:18:13,040
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm sex inferior.

1208
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:17,062
Speaker 1: I watched about maybe a half hour of it and Basically what it was.

1209
01:18:17,082 --> 01:18:20,648
Speaker 1: It was sort of an old movie, which I thought it was a newer movie.

1210
01:18:20,688 --> 01:18:44,481
Speaker 1: I guess I was wrong and It started out with the woman and I don't remember anything until the major scene of the movie was basically this woman is completely naked and She has a sword and in slow motion She chops up a bunch of dudes Kill Bill volume 1 style But not as many dudes as Kill Bill volume 1 88 and her.

1211
01:18:44,521 --> 01:18:48,313
Speaker 0: yeah, so she only got what like 86 85 More like 15.

1212
01:18:48,313 --> 01:19:01,235
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there was blood and bouncing boobs everywhere and then the movie basically consisted of Some consensual sex some Non-consensual sex.

1213
01:19:01,336 --> 01:19:04,427
Speaker 0: what's the deal with consensual sex in an ultraviolet movie?

1214
01:19:04,748 --> 01:19:11,943
Speaker 1: and then lots of chopping people up in blood and a really lame Political Yakuza plot?

1215
01:19:12,044 --> 01:19:12,689
Speaker 1: that was yeah.

1216
01:19:12,850 --> 01:19:14,372
Speaker 0: see the thing is whatever.

1217
01:19:14,673 --> 01:19:19,059
Speaker 0: I hung out most of that night in the room with cool people recording a whole bunch of stuff.

1218
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:25,550
Speaker 0: and Now right before this Scott specifically had chided me when I said I wasn't going to watch this movie.

1219
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:28,077
Speaker 1: You didn't see any of the movies.

1220
01:19:28,117 --> 01:19:30,103
Speaker 1: you had to go see at least one ultraviolet.

1221
01:19:30,123 --> 01:19:31,006
Speaker 0: I saw belladonna.

1222
01:19:31,206 --> 01:19:32,430
Speaker 1: that wasn't ultraviolet.

1223
01:19:32,691 --> 01:19:33,333
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

1224
01:19:33,414 --> 01:19:39,537
Speaker 0: Honestly, the tradition isn't going so well because there haven't been so many Worthwhile violent movies.

1225
01:19:39,617 --> 01:19:39,777
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1226
01:19:39,818 --> 01:19:40,881
Speaker 1: Hey Otakon listen up.

1227
01:19:40,922 --> 01:19:44,898
Speaker 1: You got to find the most violent and horrible movies You can and put them on Saturday night.

1228
01:19:45,018 --> 01:19:47,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what it's a it's your duty.

1229
01:19:47,550 --> 01:19:52,050
Speaker 0: You realize if they follow the progression of trying to beat every year, they'll end up with snuff films.

1230
01:19:52,692 --> 01:19:53,153
Speaker 1: Awesome.

1231
01:19:53,575 --> 01:19:57,889
Speaker 0: and then what there's nothing worse there's nothing more than that.

1232
01:19:59,133 --> 01:20:04,129
Speaker 1: They'll get a time machine and like videotape the Holocaust and bring the tapes back to us.

1233
01:20:04,451 --> 01:20:06,802
Speaker 0: That's really just a high production value snuff film.

1234
01:20:07,626 --> 01:20:14,466
Speaker 0: I guess yeah Yeah, but I so all right, he yells at me why are you gonna not see this movie?

1235
01:20:14,486 --> 01:20:24,144
Speaker 1: this movie's gonna be awesome Ah, but the problem I think is that the descriptions in the Otakon con book They conflicted slightly with IMDB and that they were much more positive.

1236
01:20:24,245 --> 01:20:29,323
Speaker 1: and now I see that Everything in the Otakon con book is described in a positive light.

1237
01:20:29,644 --> 01:20:31,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, so then I'm waiting in the room.

1238
01:20:31,532 --> 01:20:35,945
Speaker 0: You know we're recording this we're finishing up this or this one roundtable and we're about to start another one.

1239
01:20:36,005 --> 01:20:43,366
Speaker 0: when the anime world order people are gonna arrive and Scott and everyone return and the words out of everyone's mouths are basically wow.

1240
01:20:43,406 --> 01:20:44,550
Speaker 0: That was a waste of time.

1241
01:20:45,150 --> 01:20:46,499
Speaker 0: Goddamn, I could have been asleep.

1242
01:20:46,901 --> 01:20:47,344
Speaker 0: Yep.

1243
01:20:47,908 --> 01:20:53,949
Speaker 0: Oh, well I seem to recall last year when I walked out of whatever the hell that violent movie was.

1244
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:57,478
Speaker 1: Oh It was something else is something else.

1245
01:20:57,518 --> 01:21:01,670
Speaker 0: part two and I remember that as I walked out you said to me Where are you going rim?

1246
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:02,813
Speaker 0: You're breaking the tradition.

1247
01:21:03,394 --> 01:21:06,603
Speaker 0: and then when you arrived at the room several hours later, your words were wow.

1248
01:21:07,446 --> 01:21:08,849
Speaker 0: That was a waste of my life.

1249
01:21:09,372 --> 01:21:10,296
Speaker 1: Hey, you know what?

1250
01:21:10,738 --> 01:21:17,010
Speaker 1: It's my tradition that every year I'm gonna have three days or four days of awesomeness.

1251
01:21:17,352 --> 01:21:20,570
Speaker 1: I got a waste two of those hours at least doing something.

1252
01:21:20,872 --> 01:21:29,189
Speaker 0: All right Otakon if you want to mess with Scott of geek nights All you have to do is show the worst crap you can find at midnight on Saturday and he'll be there.

1253
01:21:29,631 --> 01:21:30,313
Speaker 1: I will be.

1254
01:21:30,333 --> 01:21:33,301
Speaker 0: just show like I don't even know like some.

1255
01:21:33,943 --> 01:21:36,229
Speaker 1: how else am I supposed to become an expert on this topic?

1256
01:21:37,890 --> 01:21:45,030
Speaker 0: If I don't sit through at least some of this shit good God, okay Peter what do you have to say to everyone out there about Otakon?

1257
01:21:46,573 --> 01:21:51,125
Speaker 0: Now at this point we had actually recorded another good hours worth of content.

1258
01:21:51,145 --> 01:21:57,766
Speaker 0: Well, actually a good 45 minutes and We realized that there's no way we can cover all of Otakon 2006 in only one episode.

1259
01:21:59,532 --> 01:22:06,198
Speaker 0: so rather than have a really lopsided distribution, we've cut it off now and Next Wednesday on anime day.

1260
01:22:06,238 --> 01:22:29,689
Speaker 0: We will continue with the remainder of our coverage which will include Among other things a long long discussion about panels that Otakon and our feelings on them the concert the rave our hotel room and the crazy parties we had the roundtables and interviews we had the assassination attempt that was undertaken by anime world order against geek nights one fateful night.

1261
01:22:29,709 --> 01:22:49,489
Speaker 0: and finally the geek fable of our Sunday Which I don't really want to get into other than the fact that We have discovered that when both Scott and I lose our voices social order around us breaks down Quickly, so of course once again, you can listen to our panel that we recorded live at Otakon on Monday.

1262
01:22:50,555 --> 01:22:55,799
Speaker 0: This previous Monday this previous Tuesday yesterday you could have heard all about video games at Otakon.

1263
01:22:56,100 --> 01:23:00,877
Speaker 0: today is the first half of our coverage of Otakon and Tomorrow a very important episode.

1264
01:23:00,937 --> 01:23:08,550
Speaker 0: we're going to talk about some interesting things that we did in Wildwood, New Jersey When we were bored and we realized that we like hacking computers.

1265
01:23:08,690 --> 01:23:11,014
Speaker 0: So why not try to hack the boardwalk?

1266
01:23:18,946 --> 01:23:21,109
Speaker 0: and that was geek nights with rim and Scott.

1267
