1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,325
Speaker 1: It's Monday, July 25th, 2022.

2
00:00:10,325 --> 00:00:10,726
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:10,766 --> 00:00:12,511
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:12,531 --> 00:00:18,799
Speaker 1: tonight We are talking about software as a service.

5
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:20,295
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:21,704 --> 00:00:26,000
Speaker 1: So, uh, you know in olden times we would say the inverse of the weather.

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,172
Speaker 1: So when it's warm, we'd always say like woman and make this old reference.

8
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:38,553
Speaker 1: and if it's cold out We'd say warm today and we kind of vacillate but it's fucking warm today I must say having biked back home from work just now.

9
00:00:38,573 --> 00:00:40,645
Speaker 0: Oh It's so nice.

10
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:42,074
Speaker 1: I'm loving I'm not complaining.

11
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:47,660
Speaker 1: It is this is a consequence of the earth being destroyed by powers beyond my control.

12
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:50,480
Speaker 1: But in my local I can't affect it area.

13
00:00:51,182 --> 00:00:56,839
Speaker 1: I am perfectly comfortable in weather between 85 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit and we could even push that a little higher.

14
00:00:57,802 --> 00:01:01,271
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean finally, you know, it's like got some beach times.

15
00:01:01,512 --> 00:01:04,580
Speaker 0: Yeah bike times go lay in the park time.

16
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:08,698
Speaker 1: No, uh, was that we went to Sandy Hookley yesterday and you're just hanging out on Friday.

17
00:01:09,441 --> 00:01:12,349
Speaker 1: That was real good work Friday real good ocean water.

18
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,776
Speaker 0: That was no surprise.

19
00:01:14,796 --> 00:01:15,900
Speaker 0: Why the sharks are loving it.

20
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, looks like they open up Rockaway Beach again, which was closed for several days due to shark sightings.

21
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:22,220
Speaker 1: And even then they were like, yeah, there's no real risk.

22
00:01:22,341 --> 00:01:25,380
Speaker 0: But you know, I'm not sure how long it was actually closed.

23
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,780
Speaker 1: It looks like it was closed for a few days because it was closed on Sunday.

24
00:01:29,142 --> 00:01:33,420
Speaker 1: I checked it was hard to say it was hard to say no and then I got it And I saw it was closed.

25
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:38,157
Speaker 1: so I signed up for Beach Alerts and then I got an alert at like 4 p.m.

26
00:01:38,197 --> 00:01:38,578
Speaker 1: yesterday.

27
00:01:38,618 --> 00:01:41,560
Speaker 1: that said Rockaways are open again for swimming starting tomorrow

28
00:01:42,882 --> 00:01:43,002
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm,

29
00:01:43,725 --> 00:01:59,420
Speaker 1: but so while we're there over in New Jersey like off like North New Jersey like to the left to Sandy Hook in North like if you're just on that Beach a Giant plume of black smoke just like a rose from the ground like gigantic in the distance.

30
00:01:59,982 --> 00:02:01,246
Speaker 0: Well, there's like a port over there.

31
00:02:01,266 --> 00:02:02,891
Speaker 0: there is so I was like a big.

32
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:05,460
Speaker 0: there's usually some large military boat over there.

33
00:02:06,185 --> 00:02:07,979
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that thing's always there at some.

34
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:11,480
Speaker 1: so Every time within I think oh, what's the deal with all that stuff over there?

35
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,002
Speaker 1: and I never look.

36
00:02:12,062 --> 00:02:20,536
Speaker 0: I'm not military nerd enough to know if it belongs to the Coast Guard or the Navy or if it's in Service or if it's a destroyer or a cruiser or something else.

37
00:02:20,637 --> 00:02:21,983
Speaker 1: Oh, I Do.

38
00:02:22,063 --> 00:02:24,011
Speaker 1: I know after I finished my bout of swimming.

39
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:26,320
Speaker 1: I stagger back to the beach and I just pull up my phone.

40
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,231
Speaker 1: I look on Twitter and I type, you know Be black smoke cloud North Jersey.

41
00:02:31,271 --> 00:02:33,220
Speaker 1: just see like is there something going on?

42
00:02:33,662 --> 00:02:45,024
Speaker 1: And what I find is that about every six months There's a storm of tweets where people are like what the fuck is that giant black smoke cloud from New Jersey like that part in New Jersey?

43
00:02:45,446 --> 00:02:51,980
Speaker 1: and then like days later There's a news story that is like this is the fire that caused this giant cloud of smoke?

44
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:58,692
Speaker 1: So, uh, I didn't see a lot of tweets for this one So I don't think it's one is nearly as big as the other ones in the past.

45
00:02:59,094 --> 00:03:05,940
Speaker 1: and then I found pictures of all the other Times that happened and they were so much worse that this one was probably a non event.

46
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,184
Speaker 1: I don't think that many people are.

47
00:03:07,204 --> 00:03:10,073
Speaker 0: there's so many fires in this one place because there's a whole.

48
00:03:10,134 --> 00:03:12,000
Speaker 1: it's a confluence of shipping and industry.

49
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:13,483
Speaker 1: There's just.

50
00:03:13,684 --> 00:03:15,272
Speaker 1: they're all different causes to one time.

51
00:03:15,312 --> 00:03:16,900
Speaker 1: It was a chemical plant one time.

52
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,170
Speaker 1: It was a ship that caught on fire one time.

53
00:03:19,231 --> 00:03:22,621
Speaker 1: It was a truck that crashed on a 95.

54
00:03:22,621 --> 00:03:24,438
Speaker 1: My god, is that a ratio?

55
00:03:26,403 --> 00:03:28,055
Speaker 1: I'm in the mood to watch some Horatio.

56
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:28,760
Speaker 1: It's about that time.

57
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:35,777
Speaker 1: But anyway, remember yet on the last geek nights I started the show doing the typical thing of talk about a thing without saying what it was.

58
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:42,378
Speaker 1: and Before we did the show I said what I was gonna talk about and you had a guess about what I was actually gonna talk about.

59
00:03:42,398 --> 00:03:44,690
Speaker 1: that was wrong But not a bad guess.

60
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:45,999
Speaker 1: Do you remember what your guess was?

61
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,365
Speaker 0: Water in the ceiling.

62
00:03:48,747 --> 00:03:54,696
Speaker 1: So guess what I came home to today Water in the ceiling but not in our apartment.

63
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:05,069
Speaker 1: I Come into the lobby by after biking home and there's a giant bucket in the lobby and there is water Streaming out of the ceiling into this bucket.

64
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:07,435
Speaker 1: looks like they've been constantly replacing this bucket.

65
00:04:08,036 --> 00:04:09,380
Speaker 1: There's no problem in our apartment.

66
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,273
Speaker 1: So for once the water in the ceiling is actually water in the floor.

67
00:04:13,474 --> 00:04:15,220
Speaker 0: I good in your apartment hundred percent.

68
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,565
Speaker 1: There's nothing wrong in our apartment.

69
00:04:16,586 --> 00:04:19,440
Speaker 1: So for once the gods have been kind.

70
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,673
Speaker 1: It's water in the floor instead of water in the ceiling.

71
00:04:21,853 --> 00:04:22,780
Speaker 1: It's not my problem.

72
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,868
Speaker 1: Okay All right, I guess we got a lot of news.

73
00:04:27,888 --> 00:04:30,640
Speaker 1: I guess you would dive right into it unless you have something interesting to share.

74
00:04:31,002 --> 00:04:32,671
Speaker 1: That's as good as what I mean, you know, I had.

75
00:04:32,751 --> 00:04:38,389
Speaker 0: I went to the beach on Friday went to City field on Saturday.

76
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:41,120
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah hung out inside on Sunday.

77
00:04:41,341 --> 00:04:44,693
Speaker 1: I did on Saturday, so I went out run computer.

78
00:04:44,734 --> 00:04:46,259
Speaker 0: just got here two weeks early.

79
00:04:46,842 --> 00:04:50,600
Speaker 1: I was gonna go out running and I thought I'll see how far I get in the heat.

80
00:04:50,701 --> 00:04:57,772
Speaker 1: I made it about six miles at my normal pace and then my body was like listen I let you get this far, but this is gonna be a problem.

81
00:04:58,234 --> 00:04:59,780
Speaker 1: But at the same time I felt pretty good.

82
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:11,709
Speaker 1: so I actually ran the rest of the half marathon just at a slower speed and I actually gave up a half mile before mile 13 because at that point my body said nope you were done It would be inadvisable to proceed.

83
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:13,198
Speaker 1: So I just stopped and then I biked home.

84
00:05:15,243 --> 00:05:15,686
Speaker 0: Good idea.

85
00:05:15,707 --> 00:05:19,407
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a fun time Sucks hit the bricks.

86
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:19,931
Speaker 1: Yep.

87
00:05:20,313 --> 00:05:26,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the thing is Even I you Scott and I both talk a lot about like oh don't collect things on us.

88
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,071
Speaker 1: That's a good reason like avoid completionist mentality.

89
00:05:29,091 --> 00:05:43,060
Speaker 1: Like all these harmful behaviors even I At 12 and a half miles a tiny part of my brain said just go a little bit further You'll hit 13 you'll hit a magic number and thankfully the conscious part of my brain said fuck that.

90
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:47,360
Speaker 1: And I just stopped immediately right next to a city bike station got on a bike and started slowly back in home.

91
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,127
Speaker 1: But just fuck it.

92
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:53,673
Speaker 0: I mean I rode in the The New York City Century three times.

93
00:05:53,714 --> 00:05:54,660
Speaker 0: it no longer exists.

94
00:05:54,941 --> 00:06:00,788
Speaker 0: I rode in the final one as well and the second time I did it The weather was just bad and it was.

95
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:02,634
Speaker 0: it was gross and it sucked.

96
00:06:02,694 --> 00:06:03,397
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was.

97
00:06:03,678 --> 00:06:04,320
Speaker 0: it was man.

98
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,644
Speaker 0: He just wasn't good.

99
00:06:06,206 --> 00:06:10,760
Speaker 0: So when I got to Astoria, I was like well to finish the hundred miles.

100
00:06:10,841 --> 00:06:17,587
Speaker 0: I got to go all the way to the Bronx all the way back down like Fuck that Basically after the Astoria.

101
00:06:17,647 --> 00:06:18,551
Speaker 0: rest stop though.

102
00:06:18,571 --> 00:06:28,778
Speaker 0: I went over the bridge to Manhattan I got the free water bottle t-shirt and I went right back over the bridge home Like screw this.

103
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:36,720
Speaker 1: So there is a bunch of tech news and in one news, uh, a chess playing robot broke a seven-year-old kid's finger.

104
00:06:37,742 --> 00:06:41,758
Speaker 0: I watched the video of this which is blurry and far away, which I guess is for the best.

105
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:58,240
Speaker 0: Yeah It looked like security camera footage, but basically the robot like, you know moves the piece right and Then the kid goes to move his piece and somehow the robot keeps going and doesn't just stay where it was.

106
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:08,525
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got a lot to say about exactly what happened here But I pointed the article is really funny because the head of the Moscow chess Federation said quote The robot broke.

107
00:07:08,565 --> 00:07:10,352
Speaker 1: the robot broke the child's finger.

108
00:07:10,754 --> 00:07:19,500
Speaker 0: This is of course bad Which thanks, I guess I think the thing is it breaks his finger by it has a piece, right?

109
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:26,578
Speaker 0: and it's putting the piece down and it presses the piece down towards the table and then releases it and it's like.

110
00:07:26,598 --> 00:07:30,134
Speaker 0: I Feel like there's no reason for it to even do that ever.

111
00:07:30,255 --> 00:07:31,300
Speaker 0: it should hover.

112
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,412
Speaker 0: You know It should get close enough and then let go and the piece can just drop.

113
00:07:35,493 --> 00:07:39,860
Speaker 0: that is really harder because something Drop it from like a centimeter.

114
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,723
Speaker 0: It doesn't have to.

115
00:07:40,824 --> 00:07:45,734
Speaker 1: you know drop me from a centimeter would still be able to injure a person from the pressing to get it to a centimeter.

116
00:07:48,172 --> 00:07:49,738
Speaker 0: But your finger isn't a centimeter.

117
00:07:49,778 --> 00:07:52,950
Speaker 1: your finger is not likely completely pressed flat against the ground.

118
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,515
Speaker 1: Probably his finger was a little higher.

119
00:07:54,535 --> 00:07:55,760
Speaker 1: probably caught it an angle.

120
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,405
Speaker 1: It could cause a serious injury either way.

121
00:07:57,425 --> 00:08:00,740
Speaker 0: I Think you know and plus it would just let go.

122
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,234
Speaker 0: and that then if you're there You're why?

123
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,442
Speaker 1: well, you're just gonna back up one centimeter.

124
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:12,596
Speaker 0: It would let go of the piece and now it's like it's not hurting you because even then the wobble introduced Introduces a significant amount of uncertainty.

125
00:08:12,616 --> 00:08:46,226
Speaker 1: There is a far more important underlying issue here robots in general all robots are extremely dangerous unless they follow best engineering practices with hardware interlocks and People who make software who often don't interface with hardware like this tend to solve problems thinking like a software engineer and don't incorporate the extreme multi-redundant system Nature of like hardware interlocks that all machines that interact with humans require full stop.

126
00:08:46,607 --> 00:08:54,846
Speaker 1: This is just like absolute egregious Misconduct that this robot saying well allowed humans to be within striking distance of it.

127
00:08:54,866 --> 00:09:04,198
Speaker 0: I Mean really it should have one of those You know basically the equivalent of what an elevator has where your hand is in it and it goes Exactly a hardware interlock people.

128
00:09:04,258 --> 00:09:07,430
Speaker 1: if the beam is broken by anything the robot is not allowed.

129
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:12,988
Speaker 1: That's a. that board is a no-go zone until the obstruction is cleared plus pressure sensors.

130
00:09:13,048 --> 00:09:18,310
Speaker 1: if it encounters Resistance when placing the piece it has to immediately back up and then issue an emergency stop.

131
00:09:18,711 --> 00:09:28,010
Speaker 1: I could list all the different things because one of my intern jobs when I first worked at IBM was inventorying disaster scenarios for hardware interlocks in the fab.

132
00:09:29,251 --> 00:09:30,334
Speaker 1: So I does a job.

133
00:09:30,394 --> 00:09:39,020
Speaker 1: I sat there and brainstormed on all the ways this one machine could kill someone and then the engineer Can't can't kill you.

134
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,236
Speaker 1: Ah This chest mark could definitely kill a person.

135
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:44,322
Speaker 0: We're gonna put your head under it.

136
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:49,827
Speaker 0: What if I make my move and Then I put your art put your neck under it.

137
00:09:49,847 --> 00:09:59,550
Speaker 1: So I coincidentally sneeze and That sneeze coincidentally breaks one of the legs in my chair and I fall forward just as the robot decides to make its move.

138
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:03,429
Speaker 0: I don't think your head would fit under it cuz it doesn't lift the piece high enough.

139
00:10:03,851 --> 00:10:05,356
Speaker 0: It depends your head onto it.

140
00:10:05,677 --> 00:10:08,928
Speaker 1: Ah, so the other thing people underestimate in this kind of situation.

141
00:10:09,048 --> 00:10:10,495
Speaker 1: Is that reliable?

142
00:10:10,556 --> 00:10:19,490
Speaker 1: servo motors, especially with leverage even if they don't look that strong are Terrifyingly strong and they know I'm not I'm not questioning this.

143
00:10:21,075 --> 00:10:22,506
Speaker 0: Your head wouldn't get under the.

144
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:23,756
Speaker 1: oh no It wouldn't have to.

145
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:27,377
Speaker 1: it would coming across Just to get to the vision where it's gonna drop.

146
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:33,017
Speaker 1: the piece could hit someone's head enough to fracture their skull depending on exactly What kinds of motors they're using?

147
00:10:33,057 --> 00:10:33,760
Speaker 1: I don't know the detail.

148
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:38,645
Speaker 0: It has to be a very very it's possible but that would have to be extremely unlucky.

149
00:10:38,745 --> 00:10:45,603
Speaker 1: for yes, and That is the nature of machine safety and real engineering and hardware interlocks you it.

150
00:10:46,184 --> 00:10:55,930
Speaker 1: the chance has to not just be very low It has to be either zero if possible or like beyond negligible anyway.

151
00:10:56,751 --> 00:11:05,557
Speaker 1: Anyway, this is just a comedy of errors and the people who let humans be around this robot in my opinion are guilty of extreme Misconduct with technology.

152
00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:13,025
Speaker 0: the thing I don't understand about the whole situation Right is why the fuck is a chess robot necessary only because it's cool.

153
00:11:13,346 --> 00:11:13,687
Speaker 1: That's it.

154
00:11:13,747 --> 00:11:14,470
Speaker 1: That's purely cool.

155
00:11:15,613 --> 00:11:24,290
Speaker 0: Just play digital fucking chess, right unless you're playing against a person, you know with the nice pieces It's like what's wrong with a digital event?

156
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,434
Speaker 0: Just a chess video game.

157
00:11:25,735 --> 00:11:28,665
Speaker 1: pure cool factor, especially if you're trying to get kids invested in chess.

158
00:11:28,725 --> 00:11:34,384
Speaker 1: chess is already not Popular among kids especially because they know that the computers get more popular there.

159
00:11:34,765 --> 00:11:36,290
Speaker 1: It's hard to make chess more popular.

160
00:11:37,074 --> 00:11:38,863
Speaker 0: Yeah, play a different game then.

161
00:11:38,883 --> 00:11:43,942
Speaker 1: Ah, baby Of course computers what we can go anyway, we've talked.

162
00:11:43,962 --> 00:11:45,146
Speaker 1: that's a Tuesday topic.

163
00:11:45,487 --> 00:11:55,285
Speaker 1: moving on Amazon one of the evil mega corpse in our corporate libertarian hellhole one of the drivers of the capitalist excesses destroying the world.

164
00:11:55,727 --> 00:11:59,195
Speaker 1: Amazon is Purchasing one medical.

165
00:11:59,596 --> 00:12:01,322
Speaker 0: This is if you don't know what one medical is.

166
00:12:01,443 --> 00:12:02,506
Speaker 1: I pay for one medical.

167
00:12:02,546 --> 00:12:03,670
Speaker 1: So does Emily I use it heavily.

168
00:12:04,553 --> 00:12:05,097
Speaker 0: Oh, I got.

169
00:12:05,137 --> 00:12:09,510
Speaker 0: I mean I get it for free Like I had it for free at my last work and my current work.

170
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:13,164
Speaker 0: But I didn't even bother taking the free sign up because I already have a doctor.

171
00:12:13,244 --> 00:12:18,943
Speaker 0: I don't really need a different doctor No, but yeah, if I guess if I didn't already have a doctor, right?

172
00:12:19,123 --> 00:12:21,270
Speaker 0: I probably would have gone with the one medical.

173
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,302
Speaker 1: You know why I signed up for it my last job.

174
00:12:23,322 --> 00:12:24,006
Speaker 1: I was hard.

175
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,677
Speaker 1: I couldn't find any PCP who would take me.

176
00:12:26,717 --> 00:12:31,274
Speaker 1: like no one had openings for anything that my insurance took or that took my Just gone to my doctor.

177
00:12:31,294 --> 00:12:33,302
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know if they took my insurance.

178
00:12:33,343 --> 00:12:34,166
Speaker 1: It wasn't great insurance.

179
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:34,547
Speaker 0: I go to NYU.

180
00:12:35,391 --> 00:12:41,809
Speaker 1: It's like it's an enormous, you know network of Practice insurance that my last job was not great and I'm gonna leave it at that.

181
00:12:42,151 --> 00:12:43,377
Speaker 1: But okay, they gave it.

182
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:47,269
Speaker 1: then they were after after this insurance after like a month They were like, okay, this is your it sucks.

183
00:12:47,551 --> 00:12:52,790
Speaker 1: So they gave us one medical on top of it because one medical took that insurance and then I can instantly get a doctor.

184
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,960
Speaker 0: So one medical basically is sort of like.

185
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,328
Speaker 0: it's not velvet rope doctor.

186
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:00,713
Speaker 0: It's like I don't know.

187
00:13:00,773 --> 00:13:04,128
Speaker 0: What is like it is the station at the extension at the airport.

188
00:13:04,168 --> 00:13:09,116
Speaker 1: doctor This is the premium economy Concierge medical service.

189
00:13:09,136 --> 00:13:13,749
Speaker 1: So if you fly on a plane, there's coach which is fuck you Like good luck have fun.

190
00:13:14,192 --> 00:13:22,680
Speaker 1: and then on the other end there's business class like the ten thousand dollar ticket with the Private lounge and the concierge and shall I warm sir's butthole?

191
00:13:23,001 --> 00:13:32,870
Speaker 1: but in between the two this premium economy it costs like 50% more than regular economy and the seats are slightly bigger and you get a slightly nicer area to sit sometimes.

192
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:38,540
Speaker 0: So one medical it's like you pay I think if you pay for it as well like a hundred bucks a year I'm not a lot.

193
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:39,628
Speaker 0: It's not a lot.

194
00:13:40,613 --> 00:13:43,724
Speaker 0: You know, even if you're you know hard up a hundred bucks a year.

195
00:13:43,744 --> 00:13:45,270
Speaker 0: That's you know, what?

196
00:13:46,214 --> 00:13:48,250
Speaker 0: It's divided by twelve less than ten bucks a month.

197
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,950
Speaker 1: Especially you don't have great insurance.

198
00:13:51,051 --> 00:14:04,410
Speaker 1: This is not an ad for one medical But I know multiple people who got health care that they likely would not have received Because they had a crappy like bare minimum Obamacare style health care plan plus one medical which took that plan.

199
00:14:05,173 --> 00:14:09,349
Speaker 0: Yep, so one medical basically is just like a doctor that had.

200
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:14,265
Speaker 0: you know It's a doctor Network right of medical places for regular doctoring.

201
00:14:14,346 --> 00:14:31,026
Speaker 0: It's like they don't have hospitals But you know if they're they have less patients they they pay more attention to you right and they got modern technologies Right and supposedly they're paying more attention to you, you know less waiting for appointment.

202
00:14:31,046 --> 00:14:32,088
Speaker 1: that is absolutely true.

203
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:32,710
Speaker 1: in my experience.

204
00:14:32,951 --> 00:14:36,684
Speaker 0: I have right more time to spend more time with you right etc.

205
00:14:36,704 --> 00:14:48,329
Speaker 1: I've never had to wait the appointment I don't have to talk to anyone I click on an app or a website to make any appointments any Cancellations all my medical records are in one place like easily accessible like everything just works.

206
00:14:49,157 --> 00:14:52,562
Speaker 0: Yep, so Amazon buys them right?

207
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:54,050
Speaker 0: So now the question is alright.

208
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,260
Speaker 0: Obviously, that's not great.

209
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is terrifying and bad news.

210
00:14:59,613 --> 00:15:03,376
Speaker 0: But the second question is like, okay Well, what is Amazon gonna do?

211
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:11,406
Speaker 0: because on the one hand all the evil things you can think Amazon is gonna do Yeah involve taking patient data and using it.

212
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:16,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know in bad privacy that are not just illegal.

213
00:15:16,711 --> 00:15:23,489
Speaker 1: But like the best way I'd put this is there are laws that if you're rich enough in America and you break them There's basically no consequences.

214
00:15:24,112 --> 00:15:25,215
Speaker 1: But there are some laws.

215
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:33,630
Speaker 1: no matter how rich you are if you fuck up around those laws or regulations The industry term is you are fucked.

216
00:15:34,052 --> 00:15:39,411
Speaker 1: For example, don't piss off the IRS like actually piss them off granted That's kind of hard to do.

217
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:50,825
Speaker 1: don't violate the GDPR in Europe and don't violate HIPAA in the United States Mmm, so my suspicion this is pure speculation.

218
00:15:50,845 --> 00:15:53,634
Speaker 1: I'd we have no inside info pure just guessing.

219
00:15:54,135 --> 00:16:04,648
Speaker 1: my guess is what Amazon is purchasing is the fact that one medical has a Platform that has basically passed muster on all HIPAA regulations.

220
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:12,010
Speaker 1: yet Does modern things like apps that just show you all your medical records and like transferring them between a bunch of doctors?

221
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:18,961
Speaker 1: I've seen four different primary care practitioners in four years for my physicals and Every one of them knew everything like instantly.

222
00:16:18,981 --> 00:16:21,030
Speaker 0: I see the same one every time.

223
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,921
Speaker 1: So I've had bad luck for you for four years in a row.

224
00:16:24,941 --> 00:16:27,067
Speaker 1: I get a physical next year.

225
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:28,030
Speaker 1: I set up a physical.

226
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:32,990
Speaker 1: I find out my doctor has retired or quit or moved away from New York or something that happened to me.

227
00:16:33,432 --> 00:16:34,375
Speaker 0: I came to the city.

228
00:16:34,636 --> 00:16:36,985
Speaker 0: The first doctor I saw was like the best doctor.

229
00:16:37,005 --> 00:16:38,250
Speaker 0: No, he didn't retire.

230
00:16:38,591 --> 00:16:41,061
Speaker 0: He got a job as like a director in Florida.

231
00:16:41,081 --> 00:16:42,005
Speaker 0: He was such a good.

232
00:16:42,106 --> 00:16:44,139
Speaker 0: He was such a good doctor He had to go down there.

233
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:46,252
Speaker 1: You're going to blackjack Right.

234
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:49,566
Speaker 0: So now I have basically the second best doctor at the same place.

235
00:16:49,807 --> 00:16:56,083
Speaker 0: I was just like, alright Well, whatever other doctor is at the same place I'll go to and I've had that doctor for like a decade plus.

236
00:16:56,324 --> 00:17:00,719
Speaker 1: so yeah part of my problem is I Basically never need to go to the doctor.

237
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:10,992
Speaker 1: like the last time I went for anything other than a physical which I only get every other year was When I hit my balls on my bike in that bike accident Years.

238
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,577
Speaker 0: I think I think I'm gonna go soon.

239
00:17:12,597 --> 00:17:13,520
Speaker 0: Yeah.

240
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:23,107
Speaker 1: Well, then for my once my new insurance starts, I'm 40 I'm gonna make an appointment to get the all the Adult older man checkups a little bit early just in case.

241
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:23,609
Speaker 1: cuz why not?

242
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,031
Speaker 0: I'll see.

243
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:28,982
Speaker 0: if my what my if I'll go to the regular doctor if he says I should then I will be says don't bother I won't.

244
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:47,488
Speaker 1: so I suspect Amazon wants to offer services in this space and I suspect they're buying one medical mostly because they've built a technology a Platform a bunch of services that do all of this in a way that has passed legal and regulatory muster.

245
00:17:47,508 --> 00:17:51,630
Speaker 1: I Suspect that is the only reason they have purchased one medical.

246
00:17:52,352 --> 00:17:57,230
Speaker 0: I also think that you know, there there are so many ideas of ways the Amazon could use.

247
00:17:57,692 --> 00:17:59,541
Speaker 0: you know the data that one medical has.

248
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:08,472
Speaker 0: yeah, you know technologies and Some of them may be difficult to accomplish legally, but given the resources of Amazon They can.

249
00:18:08,513 --> 00:18:11,222
Speaker 0: basically you know of all those ideas.

250
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:13,290
Speaker 0: they can push them to their limits, right?

251
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:21,552
Speaker 0: So for example, you know, it's like oh go to one medical and then your prescriptions get filled by Amazon who is Manufacturing.

252
00:18:21,593 --> 00:18:31,510
Speaker 1: I was actually gonna say my guess number two is Amazon wants to offer an online Pharmacy that's just integrated with one medical and everything else and just works.

253
00:18:32,094 --> 00:18:54,198
Speaker 0: They could also be like, oh well now, you know Even if they you know Maybe they can get away with I don't know if they can right get away with like anonymizing all the data Right and then, you know, they can use that to like, you know, okay Well, we know that you know There's a lot of this disease with this kind of person and then we have our information over here that tells us What kind of people are based on their shopping though

254
00:18:54,398 --> 00:18:58,370
Speaker 1: using that type of data even in an anonymized fashion gets real?

255
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,253
Speaker 1: Close to illegal.

256
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:02,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like what it's like.

257
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,846
Speaker 0: they don't have to know that for it's like.

258
00:19:03,966 --> 00:19:04,668
Speaker 0: it's one thing.

259
00:19:04,749 --> 00:19:07,899
Speaker 0: if they say Alright, we know rim has diabetes.

260
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,685
Speaker 0: Let's show them insulin ads, right?

261
00:19:09,725 --> 00:19:10,989
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's over the line.

262
00:19:11,069 --> 00:19:23,730
Speaker 0: clearly I hope it would be over the line But it's another thing to be like, okay We have this anonymized set of data that we can predict who's got diabetes and then we got over here our shopping data.

263
00:19:24,114 --> 00:19:25,147
Speaker 0: So already you can predict.

264
00:19:26,251 --> 00:19:39,470
Speaker 0: Predicting that is already Possibly illegal or possibly in some regulations Would be you know, it would be illegal, but if there's any way to do it Amazon's gonna try.

265
00:19:39,751 --> 00:19:43,160
Speaker 1: Do you know how much trouble Nintendo had to go through to even have a?

266
00:19:43,401 --> 00:19:46,450
Speaker 1: this is an accurate heart rate monitor in the switch?

267
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,221
Speaker 1: Yeah per ring fit.

268
00:19:48,241 --> 00:19:53,204
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, I think the thing that's getting scary now is technology wise right?

269
00:19:53,244 --> 00:19:54,046
Speaker 0: the Apple watch.

270
00:19:54,588 --> 00:19:57,580
Speaker 0: if you look I think it was two or three Apple keynotes ago.

271
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:02,269
Speaker 0: whenever the whenever the Apple watch 7 was announced It must have been September of last year, right?

272
00:20:02,471 --> 00:20:06,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, that Apple keynote was I think terrifying.

273
00:20:06,491 --> 00:20:10,590
Speaker 1: Oh it by the eyes of Apple watch or you will just die, right?

274
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:22,013
Speaker 0: Apple's marketing whatever you want to say about it has always been our products are magical Wonderful luxurious, you know, you make your life better Etc.

275
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:31,190
Speaker 0: It's always been positive messaging from Apple no matter how Corny or wrong or inaccurate or overstated or carefully worded, right?

276
00:20:31,612 --> 00:20:47,329
Speaker 0: But that was the first time I can remember ever Apple having marketing of fear right of saying buy an Apple watch or your kids might get Right, if you don't if your kids don't have Apple watches They could be kidnapped and you never know where they are.

277
00:20:47,611 --> 00:20:52,618
Speaker 0: If your kids don't know if you don't have an Apple watch you might have a heart attack and die And if you have one you could live.

278
00:20:52,678 --> 00:20:53,643
Speaker 0: it would save your life.

279
00:20:53,944 --> 00:20:55,030
Speaker 0: get an Apple watch or die.

280
00:20:55,251 --> 00:20:56,014
Speaker 0: It's like they.

281
00:20:56,175 --> 00:20:58,062
Speaker 0: that's never happened before right?

282
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:02,143
Speaker 0: and they're still going with that same Basically line of selling the Apple watch.

283
00:21:02,526 --> 00:21:07,379
Speaker 0: Yeah Stories you see news stories occasionally.

284
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,066
Speaker 0: I just saw one like two weeks ago.

285
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:10,070
Speaker 0: That was like up.

286
00:21:10,971 --> 00:21:21,697
Speaker 0: Somebody got alerts on their Apple watch For a regular heart rate and they felt fine that but the alert kept coming up enough times That they said, you know what?

287
00:21:21,758 --> 00:21:23,064
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go to the hospital.

288
00:21:23,084 --> 00:21:24,170
Speaker 0: They were a true story.

289
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,787
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's a true story or not, but it could be.

290
00:21:28,173 --> 00:21:34,310
Speaker 0: And it turned out they had some like surprise Fast-growing rare tumor thing that was gonna kill them.

291
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:40,250
Speaker 1: Well, that's it at the fact that the Apple watch is a bunch of sensors that are actually shockingly accurate.

292
00:21:40,572 --> 00:21:49,227
Speaker 1: Considering like the fact that they're just in a watch That data can make a lot of life-changing predictions if that technology is regulated.

293
00:21:49,287 --> 00:21:53,229
Speaker 0: Well, right I mean, you know, it's entirely possibly a true story.

294
00:21:53,752 --> 00:22:02,053
Speaker 0: But to go around telling people buy this or die is like, oh boy I mean, well you could buy a Google watch and see if that'll help you out like.

295
00:22:02,134 --> 00:22:04,509
Speaker 0: I'm just saying like, you know, but you know if.

296
00:22:05,671 --> 00:22:15,850
Speaker 0: If that's gonna be the thing and that's gonna be the the sales pitch for a whole line of health-related Products now because it used to be the health products are just like track your biz, right?

297
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:17,678
Speaker 0: You know what's up with your own body.

298
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,930
Speaker 0: now, it's get it or die.

299
00:22:20,532 --> 00:22:27,886
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, and if we you know, if Apple's the only one in that zone It's like Amazon's got to do something to get in that zone.

300
00:22:27,906 --> 00:22:40,311
Speaker 1: So by buying one because thanks to kovat The rate of long-term illness and disability across the global population is going to be significantly higher in the future than it would have otherwise Been.

301
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:46,489
Speaker 1: health care is to put it in the ghoulish terms of capitalism a hot space to invest in right now.

302
00:22:47,251 --> 00:22:55,693
Speaker 0: So Amazon, I wouldn't be surprised if somehow the Amazon one medical merger leads to a buy Amazon product or die Situation.

303
00:22:55,733 --> 00:23:00,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at least my choice will be among two mega corpse to decide if I live or die.

304
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:10,317
Speaker 0: You could buy either corporation a or corporation a. both start with a and they both sell something that promises to Extend your life.

305
00:23:10,377 --> 00:23:11,946
Speaker 0: Yeah by detecting death.

306
00:23:12,449 --> 00:23:18,030
Speaker 1: now This is right on the heels of Amazon basically like doing a partnership with grubhub.

307
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:18,651
Speaker 1: Amazon is.

308
00:23:18,952 --> 00:23:23,299
Speaker 1: it looks like it's in a round of merging things into itself as much as possible.

309
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:27,708
Speaker 1: again In some other news some fantastic news.

310
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:31,150
Speaker 1: Microsoft, you know my they own minecraft.

311
00:23:33,232 --> 00:23:34,356
Speaker 1: The official announcement.

312
00:23:34,657 --> 00:23:42,860
Speaker 1: the word is NFTs are fucking bent mm-hmm across Minecraft Integrations with NFTs.

313
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:47,002
Speaker 1: anything related to NFTs 100% banned full stop.

314
00:23:47,263 --> 00:23:49,416
Speaker 1: they issued a statement that is Unequivocable.

315
00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:51,150
Speaker 1: it is it is direct.

316
00:23:51,453 --> 00:23:53,329
Speaker 1: There is no way to weasel out of it.

317
00:23:53,852 --> 00:23:58,610
Speaker 1: And the funniest part about this is that I learned because of this announcement.

318
00:23:59,253 --> 00:24:06,601
Speaker 1: There are a bunch of companies who built some blockchain NFT bullshit that integrated with custom minecraft servers.

319
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:11,233
Speaker 1: All of them are fucked now every one of them Right.

320
00:24:11,253 --> 00:24:12,601
Speaker 0: Well, there's a second news on.

321
00:24:12,641 --> 00:24:14,150
Speaker 0: this is obviously a great news, right?

322
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,360
Speaker 0: Microsoft is basically to my knowledge.

323
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:20,639
Speaker 0: Microsoft has no coin bullshit and Continues to have no coin bullshit.

324
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,410
Speaker 0: So that's that's good for them, right?

325
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I guess that's also true of Apple.

326
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,474
Speaker 0: and yeah, right Apple hasn't done any cool Any coin bullshit.

327
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:32,522
Speaker 1: a heuristic you can use our crypto bullshit is.

328
00:24:32,883 --> 00:24:40,190
Speaker 1: you know that old axiom of if a company has a lot Of bad engineers, it'll likely have more bad engineers over time and vice versa.

329
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:45,143
Speaker 1: If a company does any coin stuff, they are more likely a bad company than good.

330
00:24:45,465 --> 00:24:48,822
Speaker 1: and if a company does no coin stuff They're more likely a good company than bad.

331
00:24:48,842 --> 00:24:59,550
Speaker 0: But anyway Was I saying all right, so the the news on top of this is that there are some other people who are pro coin.

332
00:24:59,894 --> 00:25:05,262
Speaker 0: I don't want to mention who they are And who are upset at this news and they they have.

333
00:25:05,342 --> 00:25:07,108
Speaker 0: they're determined they're gonna fail.

334
00:25:07,449 --> 00:25:08,934
Speaker 1: Oh I got it up.

335
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:10,719
Speaker 1: I got the whole article up about these guys.

336
00:25:11,201 --> 00:25:19,903
Speaker 0: They are determined to make basically a Minecraft coin clone And they that like they're gonna make it better than minecraft and it's like dude.

337
00:25:20,304 --> 00:25:33,370
Speaker 1: people have been making my craft for how long to almost like Every venture capitalist like low tier dipshit even adjacent to gaming has sold someone on.

338
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:36,730
Speaker 1: I'm gonna make a better minecraft and it's gonna be worth billions.

339
00:25:37,532 --> 00:25:40,780
Speaker 0: Right minecraft where it is now, right?

340
00:25:41,282 --> 00:25:41,562
Speaker 0: Let's see.

341
00:25:41,603 --> 00:25:44,450
Speaker 0: When was the first minecraft released in?

342
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,576
Speaker 0: 2011. so it's 11 years old.

343
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:56,268
Speaker 0: So if you have the resources of Microsoft Right who granted Microsoft hasn't owned it for the whole 11 year period?

344
00:25:56,369 --> 00:26:04,230
Speaker 0: but You would need all that money and the resources of even even before then minecraft had a lot of money Right because it sold a lot.

345
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:04,358
Speaker 0: Yeah.

346
00:26:04,671 --> 00:26:13,517
Speaker 0: So you would need all those resources over the course of 10 to 11 years and that will catch you up To where minecraft is now, right?

347
00:26:13,918 --> 00:26:18,230
Speaker 0: It's like if you're starting from nothing how the and minecraft is still being developed.

348
00:26:18,873 --> 00:26:20,441
Speaker 0: How are you going to catch up with it?

349
00:26:20,481 --> 00:26:22,310
Speaker 0: trying to make the same damn thing?

350
00:26:23,711 --> 00:26:24,594
Speaker 0: That's it.

351
00:26:24,634 --> 00:26:26,642
Speaker 0: Yeah, your only hope is to make something else.

352
00:26:26,822 --> 00:26:28,910
Speaker 0: You're trying to make the same thing good, right?

353
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:33,904
Speaker 1: It's like well, you never mind the fact that everyone who's claiming this in this ecosystem.

354
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:51,068
Speaker 1: All they actually want to make is Basically a scam program that convinces people to convert their money into useless database tokens, basically Yeah, this isn't a situation where like you're making another FPS where it's like, okay people played the one FPS.

355
00:26:51,329 --> 00:26:51,810
Speaker 0: it's done.

356
00:26:52,376 --> 00:26:53,247
Speaker 0: They're done playing it.

357
00:26:53,631 --> 00:26:58,747
Speaker 0: You're gonna try to make another the next one that they're gonna buy next because they're done with the first one.

358
00:26:58,788 --> 00:27:01,309
Speaker 0: This is like Everyone's playing minecraft.

359
00:27:02,232 --> 00:27:04,650
Speaker 0: How are you gonna get them to play something that's not minecraft?

360
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:10,176
Speaker 0: It's the same reason you can't get anyone to play anything that's not fucking D&D or Magic the Gathering Like.

361
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,418
Speaker 1: but the cool part is Microsoft like their announcement about this.

362
00:27:14,478 --> 00:27:30,710
Speaker 1: was it actually explained why and they said it so succinctly the speculative pricing and investment mentality around NFTs takes the focus away from playing the game and Encourages profiteering which we think is inconsistent with the long-term joy and success of our players.

363
00:27:31,512 --> 00:27:37,310
Speaker 1: Of course, they also said quote integrations of entities with minecraft are generally not something will support or allow.

364
00:27:37,491 --> 00:27:38,736
Speaker 1: Oh, there's another really fun thing.

365
00:27:38,777 --> 00:27:39,199
Speaker 1: They said.

366
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,670
Speaker 1: they basically said these are bad for everyone.

367
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,968
Speaker 0: Yeah, obvious, which they absolutely are.

368
00:27:45,933 --> 00:27:49,190
Speaker 0: But I mean you can see the same thing even without the coin part, right?

369
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,222
Speaker 0: You can see that what they're saying is absolutely true.

370
00:27:51,262 --> 00:28:02,865
Speaker 0: I just talked about Magic the Gathering And it's like yeah the profiteering that has been with Magic the Gathering since its inception has definitely You know put sort of a hamper on the play of Magic the Gathering, right?

371
00:28:03,066 --> 00:28:03,326
Speaker 0: Yeah.

372
00:28:03,647 --> 00:28:12,010
Speaker 1: Yeah Generally anything that makes scarcity where scarcity is not necessary is just a consequence of a broken capitalist economy.

373
00:28:12,845 --> 00:28:15,648
Speaker 1: Yeah and yet more news.

374
00:28:16,751 --> 00:28:20,242
Speaker 1: Global warming is of course destroying the world and I hate that.

375
00:28:20,262 --> 00:28:22,650
Speaker 1: that's just gonna be our news probably for the rest of our lives.

376
00:28:23,112 --> 00:28:45,029
Speaker 1: But now France one of the few countries that is actually Heavily investing in nuclear power as a means to stop emitting carbon into the atmosphere to try to stop this They're running into a problem and that a lot of their second-gen nuclear reactors Can't cool themselves effectively because they rely on passive cooling via water from local rivers that are now too

377
00:28:45,089 --> 00:28:45,289
Speaker 0: hot.

378
00:28:46,192 --> 00:28:49,641
Speaker 0: Yep, just about every nuclear power plant right?

379
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:56,957
Speaker 0: It's like cooling itself with a river or well cooling towers Nuclear reactors Mostly like.

380
00:28:56,997 --> 00:29:10,963
Speaker 1: there are far better ways to do this But those ways are a lot more expensive and it's a lot cheaper to use a nearby body of water to do this, obviously Yeah, so the climate change has made that water too hot.

381
00:29:11,304 --> 00:29:13,390
Speaker 0: So it basically the water is too hot.

382
00:29:13,511 --> 00:29:15,270
Speaker 0: It can't cool the nuclear reactor.

383
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:28,365
Speaker 0: So you can't really operate the nuclear reactor or you have to operate it at a much lower, you know power output and Then it's like well You know if you continue to operate it with the hot water, guess what?

384
00:29:28,385 --> 00:29:29,330
Speaker 0: You're gonna be a big trouble.

385
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,474
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you don't do.

386
00:29:30,594 --> 00:29:31,818
Speaker 0: you obviously aren't gonna do that.

387
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,283
Speaker 0: And now what happens?

388
00:29:33,544 --> 00:29:35,190
Speaker 0: Well, you don't have enough power.

389
00:29:35,693 --> 00:29:44,477
Speaker 0: everyone's turning on their air conditioners and got to get that power extra power from somewhere and They burn fossil fuel somewhere.

390
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:45,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not.

391
00:29:45,281 --> 00:29:57,240
Speaker 1: and the worst part is this is on the heels of Germany and a number of other countries that otherwise have very good progressive ideas Basically turning their back on nuclear power For somewhat dubious reasons.

392
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:07,550
Speaker 1: because despite all the trouble of nuclear power It objectively kills far fewer people and harms far fewer people than even a fraction of the equivalent production via coal.

393
00:30:07,971 --> 00:30:09,014
Speaker 1: But people don't.

394
00:30:09,415 --> 00:30:11,781
Speaker 1: people don't think about externalities of both options.

395
00:30:11,821 --> 00:30:16,374
Speaker 1: people like to think of option a has externalities Therefore we can't do it.

396
00:30:16,535 --> 00:30:22,797
Speaker 1: and then they look at option B and they don't actually talk about the externalities of option B. There is no option without externalities.

397
00:30:22,817 --> 00:30:25,848
Speaker 1: There is no way to generate power without consequences.

398
00:30:26,069 --> 00:30:29,723
Speaker 1: somewhere Mmm, and this is on the heels of.

399
00:30:29,763 --> 00:30:38,822
Speaker 0: there is one way The biological way, uh So have chlorophyll in your bod and be a plant.

400
00:30:39,484 --> 00:30:40,187
Speaker 0: that is true.

401
00:30:40,488 --> 00:30:41,090
Speaker 1: That is true.

402
00:30:42,672 --> 00:30:45,159
Speaker 0: Your generate it won't be electricity necessarily.

403
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:47,987
Speaker 0: You want to know what nervous system there would be kind of.

404
00:30:48,147 --> 00:30:49,070
Speaker 1: so you want to know?

405
00:30:49,352 --> 00:31:06,550
Speaker 1: One of the biggest mass extinction events in the world history is little guys figured out that they could make chlorophyll and do that sort of thing and They started pumping an extremely toxic substance that we call oxygen into the air and killed almost all of the life on earth.

406
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:11,577
Speaker 1: Mmm, so there are externalities of even that type of thing.

407
00:31:11,617 --> 00:31:13,661
Speaker 0: if we is that is that like.

408
00:31:13,821 --> 00:31:29,090
Speaker 0: maybe that's like, you know They're oxygen, you know focused being then carbon focused beings that oxygen beings All right, and it's like when we're in harmony together, then we have a symbiotic relationship, right?

409
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:34,790
Speaker 0: Where it's like they release the the oxygen and we breathe the oxygen release the carbon and everything's you know in balance.

410
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:45,888
Speaker 0: And then if the balance is disrupted well one form of life just dies and the other one dominates Until eventually right and it just cycles that way, you know back and forth right.

411
00:31:45,928 --> 00:31:49,967
Speaker 0: eventually You know the the other the opposite will rise again.

412
00:31:49,987 --> 00:31:58,509
Speaker 0: Yeah Cuz like the air will have so much oxygen in it The trees will sort of suffocate themselves and then the oxygen beings come back into play.

413
00:31:59,332 --> 00:32:01,639
Speaker 1: So even worse and then we'll get out of the news.

414
00:32:02,101 --> 00:32:03,746
Speaker 1: There's a story pointing out that.

415
00:32:04,308 --> 00:32:12,249
Speaker 1: so if you don't know Really close to New York City like way closer than you would expect there actually was a nuclear power plant that ran for a long time.

416
00:32:13,093 --> 00:32:13,656
Speaker 1: Indian point.

417
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:15,063
Speaker 0: it was.

418
00:32:15,164 --> 00:32:16,350
Speaker 0: it had been Native American point.

419
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:25,645
Speaker 1: yeah, it was the one of the jankiest rip like Nuclear power plants in America because America is not building nuclear power plants anymore.

420
00:32:25,685 --> 00:32:26,187
Speaker 1: It was really.

421
00:32:26,267 --> 00:32:27,070
Speaker 0: it was really old.

422
00:32:27,271 --> 00:32:28,216
Speaker 0: It had a lot of problems.

423
00:32:28,297 --> 00:32:30,590
Speaker 0: It was basically like the nuclear power plant from the Simpsons.

424
00:32:31,092 --> 00:32:34,422
Speaker 0: So this guy didn't even look at it and see how sad it looks.

425
00:32:34,502 --> 00:32:35,385
Speaker 0: Yeah, it doesn't like.

426
00:32:35,425 --> 00:32:38,848
Speaker 1: pictures of it look terrifying Misguided.

427
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:45,373
Speaker 1: progressives and environmentalists had been advocating for years to shut it down, which I Supported.

428
00:32:45,473 --> 00:32:49,243
Speaker 1: we needed to shut it down, but they were advocating shut it down.

429
00:32:49,344 --> 00:33:00,767
Speaker 0: Stop not shut it down After we build a better nuclear power plant to take up the load Right, cuz even though some you know, all kinds of people were against it right for their own reasons.

430
00:33:00,807 --> 00:33:07,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know I mean it was a shitty Absolutely before shutting it down And all parts of the political spectrum.

431
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,595
Speaker 0: people were for shutting it down for different reasons Which is why it was able.

432
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:16,976
Speaker 0: it was politically able to get it shut down because there was some agreement on that part of the Policy.

433
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:23,806
Speaker 0: right they shut it down part But the where to get more energy part of the policy had vast disagreement.

434
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:25,350
Speaker 1: not even that's disagreement.

435
00:33:25,853 --> 00:33:31,738
Speaker 1: No discussion nobody advocating for it shutting down Argued or discussed.

436
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:34,590
Speaker 1: where will we get the power from if we shut it?

437
00:33:35,515 --> 00:33:40,920
Speaker 0: That's because right the there was a dispute over where to get more power from.

438
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:51,410
Speaker 0: the problem was is that a Lot of the people in that dispute were nimby's of various shapes and sizes who wanted nothing to be built anywhere.

439
00:33:51,470 --> 00:34:02,309
Speaker 0: It's like even some of them who may have been you know for say solar panels, you know panels or hydro or Wind or something or whatever?

440
00:34:02,511 --> 00:34:11,443
Speaker 0: Geothermal anything they may have been nominally for that existing somewhere Would not permit basically that to exist anywhere.

441
00:34:11,623 --> 00:34:14,275
Speaker 0: in the state of New York There's no location.

442
00:34:14,315 --> 00:34:16,745
Speaker 0: Well at which they would be okay with it like.

443
00:34:16,784 --> 00:34:26,306
Speaker 1: so right near our apartment There's a cogeneration plant which generates a bunch of pollution If they replace that with a nuclear power plant like right next to us, I would absolutely support that.

444
00:34:26,406 --> 00:34:34,110
Speaker 1: I would rather live Directly next to a Modern nuclear power plant then within a hundred miles of a coal or oil power plant.

445
00:34:34,652 --> 00:34:53,370
Speaker 0: I would also rather have that be especially since there's an area right near the power plant is known as asthma alley Because all the all the kids who Oh surprise Public housing projects kids right living near the power plant that burns fossil fuels Have a higher rate of asthma than kids who live say out in the woods or whatever.

446
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:56,429
Speaker 1: So because all these nimby's wouldn't let us build more nuclear power.

447
00:34:57,273 --> 00:35:06,058
Speaker 1: The end result now this news New York State's fossil fuel use has soared Catastrophically solely because the Indian point was shut down.

448
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:09,469
Speaker 1: We're burning more coal and oil in New York State than ever.

449
00:35:11,452 --> 00:35:17,859
Speaker 1: So, uh, yeah getting a little sick of the anti-nuclear Movement because we do not have alternatives.

450
00:35:18,481 --> 00:35:21,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, you know, it's like listen, you know, just do something.

451
00:35:21,712 --> 00:35:23,650
Speaker 0: It's like yeah, okay nuclear's got problems.

452
00:35:24,192 --> 00:35:27,950
Speaker 0: But it's like anything is better than burning the fossil fuel, right?

453
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:35,121
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, even if you're gonna build a nuclear power plant and then you know figure out just just do it to fit You know while you while you can to figure out something.

454
00:35:35,141 --> 00:35:36,730
Speaker 0: but you ever play power grid the board game.

455
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:41,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like come on build an interim power plant just to get you to the next phase of society.

456
00:35:41,972 --> 00:35:44,602
Speaker 0: It's like at the end of the game of power grid.

457
00:35:44,623 --> 00:35:46,510
Speaker 0: You've got amazing power plants, right?

458
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:48,899
Speaker 0: But it's like in the minute, you know the beginning of the game.

459
00:35:48,919 --> 00:35:53,416
Speaker 0: It's like you're just burning coal oil crash Whatever, you know, you'll do whatever.

460
00:35:53,476 --> 00:35:57,770
Speaker 0: garbage nuclear a solar solar one that really sucks.

461
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:09,488
Speaker 0: It only makes like a small amount of energy power that one anything you can do to get power to the houses Right, and then at the end of the game then you'll have something amazing and great, right?

462
00:36:09,608 --> 00:36:11,638
Speaker 1: Yeah Actually, I'll link to.

463
00:36:11,658 --> 00:36:13,030
Speaker 1: there's a great kurgis act video.

464
00:36:13,412 --> 00:36:30,504
Speaker 1: I can't make them things of the day because I've linked to them a bunch in the past but they did a long-form analysis of how nuclear power probably is the best and Most likely to succeed way to get us off of fossil fuels before we can do something else

465
00:36:31,367 --> 00:36:32,370
Speaker 0: and like a Dyson sphere

466
00:36:32,952 --> 00:36:51,449
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually to get us to the point where we could do something like a mini Dyson sphere, but it might be impossible to get to that distant phase without using nuclear power in the middle room because nothing else could generate that much power Except coal and oil which will literally kill us all if we burn.

467
00:36:51,469 --> 00:36:54,280
Speaker 0: thing I want to think about is like, you know, cuz I'm a nerd right?

468
00:36:54,301 --> 00:36:56,690
Speaker 0: I think about in board game video game jobs, right?

469
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:02,667
Speaker 0: It's like let's say that it takes, you know X energies to build right the.

470
00:37:02,867 --> 00:37:03,870
Speaker 0: what something right?

471
00:37:04,071 --> 00:37:10,675
Speaker 0: there's already some project and You know the earth only has X Energies, right?

472
00:37:10,715 --> 00:37:11,780
Speaker 0: It's like you play Starcraft.

473
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,729
Speaker 0: It's like eventually there's no Tyderium.

474
00:37:14,433 --> 00:37:14,735
Speaker 1: Are you?

475
00:37:14,936 --> 00:37:16,970
Speaker 1: are you about to talk about the Olduvai theory?

476
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,810
Speaker 1: I'm just saying I'm just curious if that's what you're going for.

477
00:37:21,871 --> 00:37:23,516
Speaker 0: Yeah, we could we could get.

478
00:37:23,556 --> 00:37:30,241
Speaker 0: if we don't, you know, spend our energy wisely, you know, even if we go nuclear It's like alright, there's no more nuclear material left geniuses.

479
00:37:30,301 --> 00:37:31,205
Speaker 0: Now what you didn't?

480
00:37:31,245 --> 00:37:32,269
Speaker 0: you didn't build the next thing?

481
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:36,258
Speaker 0: Yeah, so basically your energy on air conditioning instead.

482
00:37:36,298 --> 00:37:40,670
Speaker 1: now what there is a critical art credible argument with a lot of debate.

483
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:42,075
Speaker 1: This is not settled science.

484
00:37:42,115 --> 00:38:04,160
Speaker 1: This is like an ongoing debate among experts and has been for At least a hundred years, but there's a theory or an idea that the you the earth has a finite amount of Accessible energy to pre-industrial civilizations meaning there is energy You can access only with an advanced fully powered civilization.

485
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:11,542
Speaker 1: and there's other energy that starting from nothing Cavemen could eventually harness that energy and like rebuild society.

486
00:38:12,505 --> 00:38:20,030
Speaker 1: if you use up that Accessible energy and then you fuck up the idea is that now it's too late.

487
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,890
Speaker 1: There is literally no way to ever make an advanced society on earth again.

488
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:23,754
Speaker 1: you had your chance.

489
00:38:24,055 --> 00:38:29,678
Speaker 1: the accessible resources are gone unless aliens come and Harness the inaccessible energy.

490
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:32,369
Speaker 1: You've destroyed the possibility of civilization on earth.

491
00:38:33,172 --> 00:38:38,190
Speaker 0: There could be and you know a new and like a long period of time it could come back.

492
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,501
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah dinosaur dinosaurs like right?

493
00:38:40,641 --> 00:38:41,325
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's all.

494
00:38:41,345 --> 00:38:45,643
Speaker 0: phase two of all the human They call the humans die and someone else arises.

495
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:49,580
Speaker 0: in a few billion years They could burn us the way we burn the dinosaur.

496
00:38:49,701 --> 00:38:52,390
Speaker 1: Ah, but that is all well, actually it wasn't really dinosaurs It's mostly algae.

497
00:38:52,452 --> 00:39:02,570
Speaker 1: but anyway the I'll just say the problem is that could be a clock that still runs out because There's a limited number of cycles that can happen before the Sun starts to emit less energy and then we're all fucked.

498
00:39:03,332 --> 00:39:04,356
Speaker 0: That's a very long time.

499
00:39:04,416 --> 00:39:05,560
Speaker 1: It is a very long time.

500
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:08,289
Speaker 0: We have quite a few chances before that happened.

501
00:39:08,329 --> 00:39:20,250
Speaker 1: Yep uh, but my point to get into the main bit is just that nuclear power in my personal opinion is Possibly the only way we have to avoid having to have that conversation.

502
00:39:24,572 --> 00:39:27,367
Speaker 1: but anyway things of the day.

503
00:39:27,387 --> 00:39:43,610
Speaker 1: so You know in New York There's all those like big peers that go out like off of Manhattan that are abandoned But look like they had like old-timey like 1920s stuff on them Like all those pleasure peers as a few of them that I can think of.

504
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:46,816
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of them are gone But there's you know There's a few around the one on the east side.

505
00:39:46,877 --> 00:39:52,546
Speaker 1: actually sadly they blocked off now and it looks like they're gonna tear it down Because it's sinking into the river, but it's

506
00:39:52,707 --> 00:39:53,110
Speaker 0: dangerous

507
00:39:53,472 --> 00:39:58,196
Speaker 1: Yeah, and also before if they don't tear it down like kids hang out on that thing Like I see them every time I run fast it

508
00:39:58,658 --> 00:40:04,478
Speaker 0: I would hang out there and I see here's you can go on like oh, yeah Can RCP or down in Brooklyn is happening?

509
00:40:04,498 --> 00:40:06,564
Speaker 0: There's yeah, you know a lot going on down there.

510
00:40:06,725 --> 00:40:18,121
Speaker 1: So if you ever go to the UK there are structures easily an order of magnitude bigger than some of the biggest peers in New York City that Are all decrepit and abandoned.

511
00:40:18,141 --> 00:40:19,169
Speaker 1: now, but they're still out there.

512
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:36,047
Speaker 1: We're talking like the size of a convention center just hanging out like off over the water slowly rusting and those are pleasure peers from like the like a Effectively old-timey like late Victorian through Edwardian Britain.

513
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:39,440
Speaker 0: Yeah And you ever watch your watch great mouse detective, right?

514
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,243
Speaker 0: It's like they go.

515
00:40:40,343 --> 00:40:41,267
Speaker 0: they go to this tavern.

516
00:40:41,327 --> 00:40:42,110
Speaker 0: Where's the tavern?

517
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:50,143
Speaker 0: It's like down off the side very like there's a dock right in front of the door to the tavern Clearly off some pier like, you know down.

518
00:40:50,204 --> 00:40:51,450
Speaker 0: it's not up on the street level.

519
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:54,842
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got a place like Brighton like that was the history of their whole city.

520
00:40:54,882 --> 00:40:56,809
Speaker 1: And basically this video is.

521
00:40:56,869 --> 00:40:57,700
Speaker 1: it's long It's like 45 minutes.

522
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:00,897
Speaker 1: it's a documentary but it talks about.

523
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:05,127
Speaker 1: it's like what those peers were actually like when they were in use.

524
00:41:05,849 --> 00:41:08,855
Speaker 0: and I Wonder what goes on in there?

525
00:41:09,136 --> 00:41:09,637
Speaker 1: You know what?

526
00:41:09,878 --> 00:41:10,360
Speaker 1: You know what?

527
00:41:10,741 --> 00:41:12,085
Speaker 1: You're pretty close to the truth.

528
00:41:12,446 --> 00:41:13,470
Speaker 0: They know the truth.

529
00:41:13,911 --> 00:41:14,773
Speaker 1: Yeah, the truth.

530
00:41:15,816 --> 00:41:20,490
Speaker 1: if you have an idea that the old old-timey people were different from modern people watch this video.

531
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:26,070
Speaker 1: No, but those peers did some cool shit that I think we need to bring back today.

532
00:41:27,653 --> 00:41:28,900
Speaker 0: Is it unsafe shit?

533
00:41:29,182 --> 00:41:31,003
Speaker 1: No, absolutely not Okay.

534
00:41:31,712 --> 00:41:39,681
Speaker 1: Other there was the one woman who would had a show where she would dive off the pier into the water over and over again After cajoling people into betting money that she wouldn't make it.

535
00:41:39,741 --> 00:41:41,629
Speaker 1: but otherwise, that's pretty much cool.

536
00:41:43,955 --> 00:41:44,600
Speaker 1: Hey say what do you got?

537
00:41:45,527 --> 00:41:51,850
Speaker 0: so While we're still talking about so much climate change because that's all we're gonna be talking about the rest of our lives anyway?

538
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:52,311
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

539
00:41:52,372 --> 00:41:59,591
Speaker 1: Well, you know this year is the hottest summer I've ever experienced and it's also the coldest summer I ever will experience again Mm-hmm.

540
00:41:59,792 --> 00:42:01,137
Speaker 1: That's a very different move.

541
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,040
Speaker 0: Yep.

542
00:42:02,402 --> 00:42:04,750
Speaker 0: So I'm pretty sure this story does not look fake to me.

543
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:07,646
Speaker 0: It looks like a real story on a real website, right?

544
00:42:07,706 --> 00:42:10,678
Speaker 0: So But basically here's the deal.

545
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:19,270
Speaker 0: air conditioning is not great, right, you know Even the best air conditioners like the mini split ones or like the big the big ones for a big building.

546
00:42:19,812 --> 00:42:21,116
Speaker 0: You know the efficiency of them.

547
00:42:21,136 --> 00:42:25,650
Speaker 0: It's like it's using a lot of energy, you know, just to move heat from one side to the other.

548
00:42:26,296 --> 00:42:26,418
Speaker 0: It's.

549
00:42:26,438 --> 00:42:26,641
Speaker 0: there

550
00:42:26,863 --> 00:42:38,830
Speaker 1: are extremely efficient ones however, they can only be deployed in very large dense buildings and Yeah, that's not what you can put in like a bus or someone's small house

551
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:47,506
Speaker 0: Yeah, but one of the things that hurts the efficiency of an air conditioner is that it is not just cooling All right, just pumping heat from one side to the other.

552
00:42:47,566 --> 00:43:00,190
Speaker 0: It's also Dehumidifying right because you have bait like you ever see like air conditioners people have and it's like this You know a little outlet on them and like water just leaks onto the street or the outside because it's condensation, right?

553
00:43:00,251 --> 00:43:05,239
Speaker 0: You know, everyone knows you got a hot thing a cold thing Condensation right and it's humid inside.

554
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,101
Speaker 0: right is.

555
00:43:06,382 --> 00:43:07,726
Speaker 0: humidity is always relative.

556
00:43:07,827 --> 00:43:08,890
Speaker 0: It's it's about right.

557
00:43:09,072 --> 00:43:10,690
Speaker 0: It's not about the total amount of water.

558
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:16,830
Speaker 0: It's about how much water the air can hold versus how much water is in the air, right?

559
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:20,695
Speaker 0: So it's like the capacity of a sponge Versus how wet it is.

560
00:43:20,755 --> 00:43:24,650
Speaker 0: if you decrease the sponges capacity the same amount of water suddenly gets really wet.

561
00:43:25,932 --> 00:43:28,944
Speaker 0: But the point is you want to dehumidify because it feels gross right.

562
00:43:28,964 --> 00:43:30,410
Speaker 0: people don't like it when it's really humid.

563
00:43:31,552 --> 00:43:34,785
Speaker 0: So air conditioners as a side effect of what they do.

564
00:43:34,825 --> 00:43:36,090
Speaker 0: They're dehumidifying right?

565
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:41,189
Speaker 0: You know, the water is condensing in the air conditioner and leaking outside the the building, right?

566
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:47,454
Speaker 0: So but when air conditioners do that, that's really inefficient it's it's hurting.

567
00:43:47,474 --> 00:43:58,370
Speaker 0: or if the air conditioner didn't have to dehumidify if you just had a dry hot place and You wanted to cool it down the air conditioner could do that much more readily with much less energy.

568
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:06,017
Speaker 0: So if you could find a way to dehumidify Separately from the air conditioner, right?

569
00:44:06,238 --> 00:44:13,880
Speaker 0: That was say more efficient than the dehumidifiers that we have that you just go and buy What we used in RIT.

570
00:44:16,332 --> 00:44:18,323
Speaker 0: Yeah, I thought that was a humidifier.

571
00:44:18,383 --> 00:44:19,590
Speaker 1: No, that was a dehumidifier.

572
00:44:20,352 --> 00:44:26,989
Speaker 1: Okay, the point is if you just buy a dehumidifier we live we our apartment was underground and basically a swamp.

573
00:44:28,251 --> 00:44:32,202
Speaker 0: Anyway, if you buy a dehumidifier, those are not really that efficient either.

574
00:44:32,422 --> 00:44:35,130
Speaker 0: right and yet to keep emptying the water right which sucks.

575
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:40,262
Speaker 0: So how could if we could make a more efficient dehumidifier?

576
00:44:40,664 --> 00:44:42,469
Speaker 0: Not only would that be good on its own?

577
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:46,964
Speaker 0: Especially for you know, just places that needed to be dry for whatever reason.

578
00:44:47,024 --> 00:44:49,686
Speaker 0: libraries, you know present any kind of thing like that.

579
00:44:51,061 --> 00:45:01,390
Speaker 0: but You could combine it with an air conditioner and the air conditioner and this better Dehumidifier combined would use less energy than just the air conditioner on its own.

580
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:10,630
Speaker 0: So somebody has invented what appears to be a somewhat ingenious Dehumidifier and the way it works is there's a desiccant in it.

581
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:14,450
Speaker 0: So a desiccant is basically the opposite of a humectant, right?

582
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:17,487
Speaker 0: It's just like a chemical that takes water out of.

583
00:45:17,507 --> 00:45:21,730
Speaker 0: you know The air and that's why you have like what do they call the silica gel packets, right?

584
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:25,370
Speaker 0: Whenever you buy something the silica gel is a desiccant.

585
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:34,321
Speaker 0: It's it's making sure that the box with the sneakers in it stays dry and you know It doesn't get ruined during shipping and gets all soggy or whatever.

586
00:45:34,341 --> 00:45:38,798
Speaker 0: All right, so, you know, I guess mothballs I guess keep moths away.

587
00:45:38,818 --> 00:45:40,890
Speaker 0: I don't know they might also be a desiccant.

588
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:42,595
Speaker 0: No mothball.

589
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:48,147
Speaker 1: so there are different mothballs now, but mothballs relief release that naphthalene which is deadly to moths.

590
00:45:49,471 --> 00:45:50,800
Speaker 0: Okay, not great for you either.

591
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:52,470
Speaker 1: mothballs are not good for humans.

592
00:45:53,651 --> 00:45:55,780
Speaker 0: But I thought they also preserve the clothes with dryness.

593
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:56,141
Speaker 0: I could be.

594
00:45:56,241 --> 00:45:58,593
Speaker 1: no they just make the clothes smell like an old grandma from the 20s.

595
00:45:59,596 --> 00:46:08,930
Speaker 0: alright The point is the way this Dehumidifier works is they got a desiccant in there and they got two sides to the dehumidifier, right?

596
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:12,062
Speaker 0: So one side the desiccant is bringing in all the water.

597
00:46:12,182 --> 00:46:13,487
Speaker 0: like give me that water, right?

598
00:46:13,548 --> 00:46:14,110
Speaker 0: I'm a desiccant.

599
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:14,836
Speaker 0: That's what I do.

600
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:31,970
Speaker 0: on the other side They're using energy, right but a small amount to sort of refresh the desiccant That was just used and is already full Right, and then once the one side right is sort of refreshed the whole thing swaps.

601
00:46:32,773 --> 00:46:37,730
Speaker 0: And now you're refreshing the side that's full while the other side does the dehumidifying.

602
00:46:38,132 --> 00:46:41,329
Speaker 1: So now we got a heat pump and a humidity pump.

603
00:46:41,952 --> 00:46:52,003
Speaker 0: It's basically a chemical humidity pump and because the desiccant is doing a lot of the work The only energy you're expending is the energy to refresh the desiccant.

604
00:46:52,525 --> 00:46:56,469
Speaker 0: It's a lot more efficient in theory I guess than the normal old.

605
00:46:57,197 --> 00:47:02,222
Speaker 1: I haven't read all the details on it But I imagine the production and the life cycle of the desiccant.

606
00:47:02,723 --> 00:47:04,770
Speaker 1: it can be done at scale and thus economically.

607
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:09,548
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know if you have to replace you're gonna have to replace the desiccants completely at some point.

608
00:47:09,649 --> 00:47:16,590
Speaker 0: Yeah But it's you know, it's I think of it similarly to way I think about like a catalytic converter to where there's like.

609
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:19,201
Speaker 0: You know, it's a chemical process that's happening right?

610
00:47:19,241 --> 00:47:21,190
Speaker 0: That's you know, saving you energy.

611
00:47:21,331 --> 00:47:28,169
Speaker 0: so if you put one of these and set it up in a room it'll dry it out and then your air conditioner will also use less energy.

612
00:47:28,189 --> 00:47:35,110
Speaker 0: and Hopefully this can you know, hopefully this is just you know, the kind of idea that can work, right?

613
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:43,830
Speaker 0: You know people are trying to solve climate change with ideas for producing energy And they're covering energy and capturing carbon.

614
00:47:44,051 --> 00:47:52,570
Speaker 0: It's like you could do a lot just by finding more efficient ways to do things We already do right and we have to do all of these things, right?

615
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:55,805
Speaker 0: It's like they replace fossil fuels with a battery-powered car, but it's like.

616
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:56,730
Speaker 0: is it more efficient?

617
00:47:57,110 --> 00:48:02,066
Speaker 0: Maybe you know, but it's like being more efficient is gonna help a lot more.

618
00:48:02,226 --> 00:48:09,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, right It's like find a way to get the same amount of work done with less juice and here is one way to do that.

619
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:12,590
Speaker 1: Maybe in the meta moment the geek big geek nights book club book.

620
00:48:12,671 --> 00:48:17,983
Speaker 1: It'll be a very short one Which is my gift to you after the tale of Genji a few times ago.

621
00:48:18,485 --> 00:48:19,990
Speaker 1: Binti by Nnedi Okorafor.

622
00:48:20,652 --> 00:48:25,950
Speaker 1: It is about a Space Academy and someone traveling to join the Space Academy.

623
00:48:26,351 --> 00:48:28,780
Speaker 1: It'll probably take you one session to read.

624
00:48:29,282 --> 00:48:31,530
Speaker 1: We'll do the show either next Thursday or the following Thursday.

625
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:34,058
Speaker 1: I see no reason not to and depending on Scott picks.

626
00:48:34,298 --> 00:48:34,900
Speaker 1: I have chosen.

627
00:48:35,622 --> 00:48:36,365
Speaker 1: there are two books.

628
00:48:36,425 --> 00:48:37,047
Speaker 1: I'm thinking of.

629
00:48:37,588 --> 00:48:43,075
Speaker 1: so we'll see what Scott picks before I pick mine, but It'll be.

630
00:48:43,216 --> 00:48:46,600
Speaker 1: maybe I'll let Scott choose among the two For my good.

631
00:48:47,629 --> 00:48:49,860
Speaker 0: Oh Is that is that gonna be a new.

632
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,030
Speaker 0: we could do that as a new book club thing, right?

633
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:53,334
Speaker 0: I swear and right.

634
00:48:53,354 --> 00:49:00,470
Speaker 1: see like starting now who chose the first ever book club, but I Don't have an easy way to check that right now with my streaming setup, right?

635
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:03,944
Speaker 0: Whoever it was right the other person can choose the final book.

636
00:49:04,145 --> 00:49:05,510
Speaker 0: you use our current system.

637
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:10,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, make sure make sure everyone who had the starting player marker everyone gets one legit pick, right?

638
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:13,364
Speaker 0: Our current system is you have you pick whatever you want.

639
00:49:13,404 --> 00:49:15,373
Speaker 0: The other person has no veto No, nothing.

640
00:49:15,513 --> 00:49:18,443
Speaker 0: and then we just take turns right and we just use.

641
00:49:18,483 --> 00:49:20,209
Speaker 0: you know, basically threats to.

642
00:49:22,551 --> 00:49:33,185
Speaker 0: Maybe we could switch over to an I cut you choose scenario where you choose two books and the other person picks Which of the two and we go back and forth like that instead.

643
00:49:33,326 --> 00:49:36,630
Speaker 1: I like this idea So we'll figure out exactly who gets to do this first.

644
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:40,784
Speaker 1: But if it is me then on the next one, I will offer two choices.

645
00:49:41,707 --> 00:49:42,550
Speaker 0: I cut you choose.

646
00:49:42,851 --> 00:49:44,758
Speaker 1: Yeah defense if you want to sting.

647
00:49:44,778 --> 00:49:47,870
Speaker 1: I don't know if I want to reveal anything about what my two will be because they are.

648
00:49:49,773 --> 00:49:54,921
Speaker 1: They are so diametrically radically different from each other that it's almost funny and I don't want to.

649
00:49:55,062 --> 00:50:00,410
Speaker 0: I mean you could always just choose two awful books or You know or choose two amazing ones or make it a hard choice.

650
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:05,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly, but I feel like choosing two awful books just makes the person who put that choice up look bad.

651
00:50:05,734 --> 00:50:09,610
Speaker 1: So I think we are discouraged from that by peer pressure.

652
00:50:10,612 --> 00:50:11,739
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think so.

653
00:50:11,779 --> 00:50:13,470
Speaker 0: with I cut you choose right?

654
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:22,777
Speaker 0: It's like you could basically guarantee that a particular book never becomes book club book by just always choosing the other option Right.

655
00:50:23,465 --> 00:50:25,093
Speaker 1: It's basically It always.

656
00:50:25,334 --> 00:50:30,610
Speaker 0: rim could have just come up and be like katamani cristo and the star fiction kind of money.

657
00:50:32,352 --> 00:50:33,058
Speaker 0: Right, exactly.

658
00:50:33,098 --> 00:50:33,461
Speaker 0: Just keep.

659
00:50:33,481 --> 00:50:37,056
Speaker 0: you could just keep doing that Again.

660
00:50:37,157 --> 00:50:38,510
Speaker 1: one day Scott will be like, you know what?

661
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,876
Speaker 1: I'll take the katamani cristo over that.

662
00:50:40,976 --> 00:50:44,246
Speaker 1: that like Star Trek Star Wars fan fiction crossover.

663
00:50:44,266 --> 00:50:44,687
Speaker 0: Will I?

664
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:48,295
Speaker 1: That can also be a gambit.

665
00:50:48,375 --> 00:50:51,307
Speaker 1: what if I put forth a choice like that and Scott fix the one?

666
00:50:51,327 --> 00:50:52,010
Speaker 1: I was hoping he wouldn't?

667
00:50:52,873 --> 00:50:56,502
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like you have to read it too, right?

668
00:50:56,522 --> 00:50:57,569
Speaker 0: Yeah, I picked the bad one.

669
00:50:57,831 --> 00:50:58,515
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's.

670
00:50:58,576 --> 00:51:06,110
Speaker 1: that's one of the important separations of power That's the safety check on this entire process because we both have to read the book.

671
00:51:06,331 --> 00:51:09,705
Speaker 1: So we are both incentivized to not put up a book that we do not want to read.

672
00:51:09,726 --> 00:51:14,778
Speaker 0: Yep Okay All right, any other metamoment?

673
00:51:14,878 --> 00:51:16,063
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's just get right into it.

674
00:51:16,144 --> 00:51:17,530
Speaker 1: software as a service.

675
00:51:17,871 --> 00:51:32,590
Speaker 1: this is an area where I can speak very directly and professionally because Much of my career has been being a product manager selling Designing maintaining software as a service offerings in a variety of markets.

676
00:51:33,574 --> 00:51:35,082
Speaker 0: Yep, so I mean back in the day.

677
00:51:35,102 --> 00:51:36,730
Speaker 0: if you wanted software, right?

678
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:38,074
Speaker 0: You would buy the software.

679
00:51:38,114 --> 00:51:50,949
Speaker 0: someone would give you right the software or at least a copy of it either the source code or Compiled binary version of it and you have it and now you can run it and no one can stop you from using it.

680
00:51:51,993 --> 00:51:54,041
Speaker 0: If you have the source code, you can modify it easily.

681
00:51:54,161 --> 00:51:56,389
Speaker 0: If you don't you can modify it with difficulty.

682
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,798
Speaker 0: Maybe it has plugins that you can write who knows?

683
00:51:59,898 --> 00:52:01,644
Speaker 0: but you have the software.

684
00:52:01,924 --> 00:52:03,590
Speaker 0: you never have to whoever gave it to you.

685
00:52:04,053 --> 00:52:06,189
Speaker 0: You never have to give them money ever again.

686
00:52:06,451 --> 00:52:16,465
Speaker 0: Yeah, unless they do some maybe some tricky DRM or you know some other shady Like you have to pay them for upgrades upgrades or patches you have to pay them.

687
00:52:16,605 --> 00:52:21,370
Speaker 1: maybe they offer Professional services to like help you out with it.

688
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:22,494
Speaker 1: There's a lot of ways to go.

689
00:52:22,614 --> 00:52:24,702
Speaker 1: but like you think of a ticketing system.

690
00:52:24,762 --> 00:52:28,275
Speaker 1: you buy JIRA they give you an exe You're running on your server.

691
00:52:28,516 --> 00:52:31,206
Speaker 1: You've got a local JIRA and you pay someone to administer it.

692
00:52:31,808 --> 00:52:37,350
Speaker 0: right now We talked about you know, the the game streaming like, you know, the what's it called?

693
00:52:37,872 --> 00:52:39,459
Speaker 0: Can't remember the name of the stupid Google thing?

694
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:40,102
Speaker 1: Oh stadia.

695
00:52:40,786 --> 00:52:41,750
Speaker 0: Yeah the stadia, right?

696
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:45,650
Speaker 0: It's like, you know that that's basically software as a service, right?

697
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:56,187
Speaker 0: somebody else will run the software on their computer right and They're just gonna send you the user interface of that software.

698
00:52:56,247 --> 00:53:11,370
Speaker 0: and in the year 22 The way you do that is with a website usually or sometimes a mobile app Or maybe even a desktop app if they're really, you know, cool But your computer isn't really doing any of the work of the software, right?

699
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:13,435
Speaker 0: The database is not in your computer.

700
00:53:13,455 --> 00:53:18,110
Speaker 0: the the processing is the heavy-duty processing isn't happening on your computer.

701
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:18,952
Speaker 0: yeah, you are.

702
00:53:19,012 --> 00:53:32,165
Speaker 0: just all the inputs and outputs are going over the network to the software that is hosted somewhere else and You're seeing and hearing and interacting with just the front end on your local device, whatever it is.

703
00:53:32,185 --> 00:53:44,550
Speaker 0: and because of that The company that makes the software Can now charge you money indefinitely or cut you off right or put limits on your use of the software or control.

704
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:46,798
Speaker 0: You know whatever way they want to break it up.

705
00:53:46,838 --> 00:53:55,650
Speaker 0: They can be like, ah, you can do 10 uses a month or You know, however, their software works, right but at the same time pricing models and whatever.

706
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:57,095
Speaker 1: However, you use the software.

707
00:53:57,537 --> 00:54:00,648
Speaker 1: if say the software breaks they got to deal with it.

708
00:54:00,688 --> 00:54:04,459
Speaker 0: Not you Yep, there are many upsides right?

709
00:54:04,499 --> 00:54:07,046
Speaker 0: You don't have to patch maintain the software.

710
00:54:07,307 --> 00:54:08,290
Speaker 0: Someone else is doing that.

711
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:10,349
Speaker 0: It's just always up to date all the time.

712
00:54:10,598 --> 00:54:15,887
Speaker 0: Yeah You also can't prevent it from being updated because they're just updating it at their wish.

713
00:54:16,007 --> 00:54:21,067
Speaker 1: I will say right now I see that and have my entire career as a positive not a negative update.

714
00:54:21,088 --> 00:54:25,396
Speaker 0: your shit Yep You know, there's some other problems right.

715
00:54:25,436 --> 00:54:29,027
Speaker 0: security wise it's like well someone else is responsible for the security.

716
00:54:29,108 --> 00:54:29,730
Speaker 0: you like that.

717
00:54:30,252 --> 00:54:34,030
Speaker 0: But if they fuck up, well, they fucked up not just you they fuck up everybody.

718
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:37,970
Speaker 0: There's a single point of failure that is now under attack, right?

719
00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:38,992
Speaker 0: It's like we don't.

720
00:54:39,273 --> 00:54:46,950
Speaker 0: it's like if you have a thousand Microsoft Exchange servers as even if someone finds a vulnerability They have to now find all the exchange servers.

721
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:48,174
Speaker 0: It's like you might not get hit.

722
00:54:48,735 --> 00:54:56,725
Speaker 0: but if there's just one exchange server for the whole world like exchange comm or something It's like no one's gonna bother with any other exchange server.

723
00:54:56,745 --> 00:54:57,590
Speaker 0: They're just gonna hit that one.

724
00:54:58,051 --> 00:55:05,714
Speaker 1: Now that can get because there's there's a lot of subtle like variations on this that edge into other something as a service Discussions.

725
00:55:06,075 --> 00:55:13,885
Speaker 1: So for example when I you know, I was telling stuff like this I'll give some concrete examples some software that monitors your financial transactions.

726
00:55:13,925 --> 00:55:17,437
Speaker 1: Like let's say I'm a product manager I have a company I'm selling that.

727
00:55:17,978 --> 00:55:20,527
Speaker 1: so we actually offered it in a few different modes.

728
00:55:20,828 --> 00:55:25,310
Speaker 1: on one hand We offered it as a pure hosted software as a service solution.

729
00:55:25,694 --> 00:55:27,330
Speaker 1: You run our agents in your infrastructure.

730
00:55:27,912 --> 00:55:36,389
Speaker 1: It sends all the logs to our servers and you just log into a web page and you access everything do everything Mm-hmm the traditional software as a service.

731
00:55:36,951 --> 00:55:46,719
Speaker 1: We also had a model where we would do the same thing, but you're all your shit would be on its own Dedicated tenancy not shared with any other tenancies like.

732
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,224
Speaker 1: it is not a shared platform.

733
00:55:48,605 --> 00:55:50,570
Speaker 1: I'm running an instance just for you.

734
00:55:50,873 --> 00:55:58,730
Speaker 0: We charge a lot more for that obviously But you're basically right when you do that, you're basically all you're doing is selling the software and you're also reselling hosting.

735
00:55:58,911 --> 00:55:59,814
Speaker 0: Yep, basically.

736
00:55:59,895 --> 00:56:01,882
Speaker 0: and and IT services, right?

737
00:56:01,902 --> 00:56:03,127
Speaker 0: So it's like you're busy.

738
00:56:03,167 --> 00:56:03,830
Speaker 0: a bundle deal.

739
00:56:03,991 --> 00:56:10,703
Speaker 0: It's like I'm selling you the software and I'm selling you hosting and IT labor So that you don't have to do that part yourself.

740
00:56:10,904 --> 00:56:11,709
Speaker 0: and a combo deal.

741
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:16,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, like buying a Gameboy and a carrying case batteries in a combo deal.

742
00:56:17,292 --> 00:56:26,770
Speaker 1: Now a third option we offered was we will give us a sir give us physical infrastructure cloud something Give us a place to run it in your own environment.

743
00:56:27,912 --> 00:56:31,370
Speaker 1: We will have access to your environment via a secure channel.

744
00:56:31,871 --> 00:56:37,489
Speaker 1: We will deploy the software in your environment and run it in your environment and manage it for you.

745
00:56:37,953 --> 00:56:39,930
Speaker 1: But the data never leaves your environment.

746
00:56:40,613 --> 00:56:43,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, now if they obviously people want to do that for compliance reasons.

747
00:56:44,513 --> 00:56:51,660
Speaker 0: But the only danger with that setup is they could be like, aha We're gonna stop paying keep running the software.

748
00:56:51,681 --> 00:56:53,908
Speaker 0: Obviously, they won't get updates or support or any.

749
00:56:53,989 --> 00:56:55,553
Speaker 1: also Spoilers.

750
00:56:55,694 --> 00:56:57,789
Speaker 1: if someone tried to do that, it would not go well for them.

751
00:56:58,652 --> 00:57:01,842
Speaker 0: I'm sure it wouldn't but they could try right with other modes.

752
00:57:02,083 --> 00:57:03,648
Speaker 0: They have no chance of trying that abs.

753
00:57:03,688 --> 00:57:04,410
Speaker 0: It'd be impossible.

754
00:57:04,591 --> 00:57:06,242
Speaker 0: Yeah, because you could just block them.

755
00:57:06,443 --> 00:57:07,168
Speaker 0: close their account.

756
00:57:07,369 --> 00:57:07,450
Speaker 0: now.

757
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:14,230
Speaker 1: Another variation on all this is some services will give you like the software service.

758
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:29,436
Speaker 1: they host the software for you like all those details I just talked about don't matter that much for this and They will also administer it for you like if there's configuration or like management still like they'll sort of just do it and some of them will do ever like.

759
00:57:29,496 --> 00:57:40,954
Speaker 1: they will make you do everything and they'll give you logins to the front end and Effectively logins to like the administrative backend like yeah manage your own users on our platform Mm-hmm.

760
00:57:41,277 --> 00:57:42,688
Speaker 1: I've seen both out there in the wild.

761
00:57:43,532 --> 00:57:46,604
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's every variation that you can kind of think of right.

762
00:57:46,644 --> 00:57:48,110
Speaker 0: and so software as a service.

763
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:56,157
Speaker 0: This model has sort of taken over over the past decade or so, right decade and a half maybe And there really isn't.

764
00:57:56,438 --> 00:58:03,206
Speaker 0: you know, very few people now are making Software that you sell unless it's like in the App Store or something.

765
00:58:03,467 --> 00:58:08,863
Speaker 1: and even then Subscription software isn't quite software as a service like Adobe Creative Cloud.

766
00:58:08,903 --> 00:58:10,228
Speaker 1: We're both using it right now.

767
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:11,713
Speaker 1: Good night.

768
00:58:11,753 --> 00:58:12,014
Speaker 1: Sure.

769
00:58:12,475 --> 00:58:13,157
Speaker 1: That is not.

770
00:58:13,539 --> 00:58:15,304
Speaker 1: arguably that is not software as a service.

771
00:58:15,545 --> 00:58:17,130
Speaker 1: That is software via subscription.

772
00:58:17,672 --> 00:58:18,915
Speaker 1: They just give me the is.

773
00:58:19,036 --> 00:58:21,423
Speaker 0: there are some services they provide like.

774
00:58:21,483 --> 00:58:26,740
Speaker 0: they're you know document cloud and yeah Parts of it, but it's not software as a service.

775
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,710
Speaker 0: It is a subscription for regular software.

776
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:32,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're not helping me run audition locally.

777
00:58:32,731 --> 00:58:35,281
Speaker 1: They're not like they do have like web.

778
00:58:35,321 --> 00:58:40,410
Speaker 0: there is like web lightroom that you can log into But it's obviously not getting used that much exactly.

779
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:40,952
Speaker 0: It's like there are.

780
00:58:41,072 --> 00:58:47,350
Speaker 0: there are some parts of it that are software as a service II but it's mostly software You're installing and running.

781
00:58:47,479 --> 00:58:58,510
Speaker 1: Yep And a big part of this like if I had to say anything software as a service is possibly the hottest Technology sector on earth right now in terms of the money that is being made by companies, right?

782
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:08,176
Speaker 0: pretty much every company that makes software has just gone with this model by default, right because Everyone's got web browsers Since phones became a thing.

783
00:59:08,296 --> 00:59:10,381
Speaker 0: Everyone's got all kinds of different devices.

784
00:59:10,461 --> 00:59:13,770
Speaker 0: It's like to start with a new company making new software.

785
00:59:14,332 --> 00:59:16,761
Speaker 0: It's like what platform are you gonna target right?

786
00:59:16,821 --> 00:59:19,310
Speaker 0: It's like it used to be just oh you make Windows software.

787
00:59:19,893 --> 00:59:20,897
Speaker 0: You don't need to make anything else.

788
00:59:20,917 --> 00:59:22,323
Speaker 0: just make Microsoft Windows software.

789
00:59:22,343 --> 00:59:22,966
Speaker 0: you're done.

790
00:59:23,006 --> 00:59:25,355
Speaker 0: right now It's like well people got Linux servers.

791
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,118
Speaker 0: They got Windows.

792
00:59:26,178 --> 00:59:27,001
Speaker 0: They got Macs.

793
00:59:27,041 --> 00:59:27,804
Speaker 0: They got iPhones.

794
00:59:27,844 --> 00:59:28,647
Speaker 0: They got Androids.

795
00:59:28,687 --> 00:59:29,630
Speaker 0: They got Nintendo switches.

796
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:31,135
Speaker 0: It's like Jesus Christ.

797
00:59:31,456 --> 00:59:31,757
Speaker 0: I can't.

798
00:59:31,958 --> 00:59:33,002
Speaker 0: I'm not a tiny company.

799
00:59:33,062 --> 00:59:36,032
Speaker 0: I can't afford to port my software ten times Right.

800
00:59:36,273 --> 00:59:46,266
Speaker 0: I got to make web software that runs on everything because everything has a web browser and then which means I got to make A web server and I can't have people installing a web server on their computers.

801
00:59:46,286 --> 00:59:47,190
Speaker 0: That's just not gonna work.

802
00:59:48,253 --> 00:59:55,020
Speaker 0: So You're just sort of making software as a service as a necessity but also because of the revenue stream necessity.

803
00:59:55,402 --> 00:59:57,429
Speaker 0: where is if you try to sell software?

804
00:59:57,449 --> 01:00:01,260
Speaker 0: and Just as a press, you know a fit object, right?

805
01:00:01,521 --> 01:00:04,009
Speaker 0: You don't get a continuous revenue stream these days.

806
01:00:04,029 --> 01:00:07,410
Speaker 0: and Then what right you run out of money?

807
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:08,373
Speaker 0: You can't pay your people.

808
01:00:08,614 --> 01:00:17,721
Speaker 0: you need to have a continuous way to pay your people which means you need to get customers paying Continuously no matter how big or small whatever you're selling is.

809
01:00:17,741 --> 01:00:25,501
Speaker 1: I think a big driver of this is that Most of the software as a service offerings are not a technology.

810
01:00:25,541 --> 01:00:28,770
Speaker 1: It's not a. they're not selling this to technology companies.

811
01:00:28,871 --> 01:00:39,650
Speaker 1: They're selling it to Normal companies that are doing something and those companies don't necessarily have like a ton of IT Expertise internally, they're like making books.

812
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:47,395
Speaker 1: They're printing books and they just need access to something to manage their book inventory or manage the subscribers to their whatever Like whatever that stuff is.

813
01:00:47,958 --> 01:00:50,210
Speaker 1: They just need but they need the process.

814
01:00:50,611 --> 01:00:55,670
Speaker 1: They're paying for access to software that will enact some sort of process or handle some sort of problem for them.

815
01:00:56,091 --> 01:01:01,120
Speaker 1: They don't want to have to deal with the technology aspect of running that software nor should they necessarily.

816
01:01:02,161 --> 01:01:04,789
Speaker 0: Yeah, think about something like, you know a CRM right.

817
01:01:04,810 --> 01:01:10,645
Speaker 0: there's a lot of sass CRM some of them really enormous like Salesforce is absolutely huge.

818
01:01:10,885 --> 01:01:14,013
Speaker 1: Oh, it's like the smaller tier one that I've used occasionally.

819
01:01:14,033 --> 01:01:16,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, so think about this, right?

820
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:20,303
Speaker 0: Salesforce is a generic CRM, right?

821
01:01:20,464 --> 01:01:22,790
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, it's like a one-size-fits-all deal.

822
01:01:22,811 --> 01:01:23,412
Speaker 1: What are you selling?

823
01:01:23,472 --> 01:01:25,077
Speaker 1: shoes knives doesn't matter.

824
01:01:25,258 --> 01:01:26,020
Speaker 0: computers, right?

825
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:28,550
Speaker 0: You're if you sell anything, right?

826
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:30,900
Speaker 0: It's sort of you can make it fit, right?

827
01:01:31,261 --> 01:01:40,625
Speaker 0: It's never gonna be a perfect fit for whatever your business is unless your business is selling Salesforce right Because that's probably right.

828
01:01:40,665 --> 01:01:42,512
Speaker 0: there number one customer is themselves, right?

829
01:01:42,552 --> 01:01:52,159
Speaker 0: So but it's like Hey, what are you gonna do if you're some company selling shoes and you need a CRM?

830
01:01:53,321 --> 01:02:11,695
Speaker 0: You can get this CRM that has been devised Enormous resources gone into developing it for a large number of years has an army of some of like top tier engineers working on it Right and you know keeps getting updates and but all this IT stuff is just taking care of.

831
01:02:12,377 --> 01:02:15,566
Speaker 0: it's not cheap But you know, what's more expensive?

832
01:02:15,907 --> 01:02:17,551
Speaker 0: It's like what would it cost you?

833
01:02:17,812 --> 01:02:18,714
Speaker 0: What's your alternative?

834
01:02:18,955 --> 01:02:19,837
Speaker 0: right a?

835
01:02:20,178 --> 01:02:21,040
Speaker 0: use something else?

836
01:02:21,161 --> 01:02:22,129
Speaker 0: That's not as good.

837
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:26,172
Speaker 1: Yeah, right Be nothing you nothing is what a lot of people do.

838
01:02:26,192 --> 01:02:27,799
Speaker 0: use nothing.

839
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,728
Speaker 0: See try to make your own.

840
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,314
Speaker 0: that's just for you.

841
01:02:33,334 --> 01:02:34,719
Speaker 0: That's perfect fit for you.

842
01:02:35,343 --> 01:02:47,157
Speaker 0: But the amount it would cost to build something It's a perfect fit for you that solves all that you would have to Resolve all these problems that the people at the SAS company have already solved over the years, right?

843
01:02:47,618 --> 01:02:49,424
Speaker 0: It's like You're not gonna.

844
01:02:49,865 --> 01:02:54,560
Speaker 0: meanwhile you're just distracting you from your actual job of selling shoes, right?

845
01:02:55,100 --> 01:03:02,824
Speaker 0: It's like you really kind of have no choice as a non tech company than to sort of use these SAS products Right.

846
01:03:03,327 --> 01:03:05,799
Speaker 0: It's like it just doesn't make sense to do anything else.

847
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:09,613
Speaker 1: Well even more interesting a lot of SAS offerings.

848
01:03:09,653 --> 01:03:16,637
Speaker 1: what they come out of is a company Has a problem to solve and there isn't a SAS solution for that thing exactly.

849
01:03:16,697 --> 01:03:18,700
Speaker 1: They need to solve it So there's no choice.

850
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:24,600
Speaker 1: They have to solve it themselves and then often what happens is being able to solve that problem.

851
01:03:25,122 --> 01:03:28,894
Speaker 1: It's more lucrative than how you would make money with that solution.

852
01:03:29,175 --> 01:03:37,567
Speaker 1: and those companies end up selling The software they built to solve their own problem to everyone else who has that problem and then they stopped selling Whatever it is, they originally sold.

853
01:03:38,291 --> 01:03:39,699
Speaker 0: Yeah people do this on purpose.

854
01:03:39,759 --> 01:03:40,181
Speaker 0: now It's.

855
01:03:40,281 --> 01:03:42,809
Speaker 0: it's so, you know common and sort of obvious.

856
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:46,440
Speaker 1: I have done this on purpose in my professional career.

857
01:03:47,203 --> 01:03:52,123
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like people, you know, it's like they're like, oh well we make shoes, right People.

858
01:03:52,204 --> 01:03:54,900
Speaker 0: all the other shoe companies need a need software.

859
01:03:55,381 --> 01:04:04,178
Speaker 0: We make shoes and we know that we need this software that does X and we can't find anything that does X worth a shit Right, and we know there's more shoe companies besides us.

860
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:08,280
Speaker 0: So if we make something that does X that's a big investment.

861
01:04:08,481 --> 01:04:15,760
Speaker 0: But there isn't a competitor and if we're first to market and we do a good enough job We can get every other shoe company to use it.

862
01:04:15,821 --> 01:04:17,379
Speaker 0: They'll have no choice right?

863
01:04:18,441 --> 01:04:25,988
Speaker 0: And then we don't even need to worry about selling shoes because we'll just sell the X tool that helps shoe selling companies And we're good, right?

864
01:04:26,371 --> 01:04:30,527
Speaker 1: It's a hell of a business model and It's worked out very well for me over the years.

865
01:04:31,209 --> 01:04:31,651
Speaker 0: It's worked.

866
01:04:31,711 --> 01:04:33,879
Speaker 0: I've seen it happen frequently, right?

867
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:42,280
Speaker 1: so One interesting aspect of that, you know Cuz I have a lot of direct experience as a head of product in this space like lots of sales.

868
01:04:43,024 --> 01:04:44,935
Speaker 1: One thing I can say that was very true.

869
01:04:45,257 --> 01:04:49,687
Speaker 1: Is that Selling it this way, you know, I mentioned before two options.

870
01:04:50,028 --> 01:04:50,951
Speaker 1: Here's the software.

871
01:04:51,613 --> 01:04:56,200
Speaker 1: use it on your own or we'll run it for you Say I did like, you know, I sell the software.

872
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,315
Speaker 1: We used to sell some of that software directly to people.

873
01:04:58,415 --> 01:04:59,080
Speaker 1: use it as you see fit.

874
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:04,020
Speaker 1: All right, our documentation had to be legit our documentation.

875
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:18,824
Speaker 1: We spent so much keeping our user guide up to date for external, you know, Joey Jojo Shaben who buys our software That documentation better answer any question they have about how to set this stuff up or they're open in a ticket to my own help Desk and that's costing me money.

876
01:05:19,506 --> 01:05:20,609
Speaker 1: So what's easier?

877
01:05:21,110 --> 01:05:34,470
Speaker 1: making real user guides, which don't really exist in the modern world often or Just hosting it for people and then I only need to make user guides for teams inside my own company who I can hire and train at scale.

878
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:45,420
Speaker 1: the economy of scale of sell of Having a team to manage the software that you give other people access for to Compared to giving them direct access to the software to manage themselves.

879
01:05:45,861 --> 01:05:48,127
Speaker 1: The economy of scale for your service team is.

880
01:05:48,809 --> 01:05:51,777
Speaker 1: it is hard to express how much of a game changer that is.

881
01:05:51,797 --> 01:05:58,560
Speaker 0: Yeah So at least also, you know from the perspective of someone who makes software for a living, right?

882
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:01,066
Speaker 0: What you know, I've always up until now.

883
01:06:01,167 --> 01:06:05,620
Speaker 0: I've always worked at companies that were not technology companies, right?

884
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:17,091
Speaker 0: They were always doing some other business of some kind and they just had data or websites or both and they needed Engineers, you know because they weren't you know to make software.

885
01:06:17,131 --> 01:06:18,896
Speaker 1: I have always worked at technology companies.

886
01:06:19,738 --> 01:06:35,540
Speaker 0: Yeah You know and what I noticed right was basically what was happening is all I was doing at work and a lot of places was gluing Existing solutions together solutions mostly but also open source solutions, right?

887
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:40,140
Speaker 0: And like I wasn't making software really not very much right?

888
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:51,146
Speaker 0: I was just there was like other software we were buying, you know We didn't have that many engineers like we couldn't build and they weren't hiring a bunch more that they needed to you know Create in anything ambitious.

889
01:06:51,828 --> 01:07:03,240
Speaker 0: So I was like all we were doing was buying or installing free or Available products that existed that someone else was making and all my work was just gluing those things together.

890
01:07:03,441 --> 01:07:05,739
Speaker 1: So guess what is easy to sell as a service?

891
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:08,914
Speaker 1: Gluing things together the service and a lot of companies.

892
01:07:08,934 --> 01:07:09,518
Speaker 1: That's all they do.

893
01:07:10,302 --> 01:07:11,267
Speaker 0: There is that is true.

894
01:07:11,287 --> 01:07:16,056
Speaker 0: If there's a combination that is a common combination You can sell a service of.

895
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:28,059
Speaker 0: you know If those two things don't combine themselves together with their own glue on their own You can sell some glue until they run you out of the market sell them the KFC Taco Bell as a service exactly.

896
01:07:29,321 --> 01:07:32,231
Speaker 0: But what was happening was I was like, hey, you know my job.

897
01:07:32,252 --> 01:07:34,520
Speaker 0: It's like I you know, I enjoy writing.

898
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:39,312
Speaker 0: Creating software like, you know is a different thing than gluing software.

899
01:07:39,332 --> 01:07:42,180
Speaker 0: Like you're still programming but it's different, right?

900
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:59,549
Speaker 0: It's not you know, it's like, you know, you go and you do some advent of code even you know Just a little programming problems and you're like, oh, this is real programming not just serializing Serializing data from one shape to another which you're not really solving any processing Problems, right?

901
01:07:59,569 --> 01:08:01,100
Speaker 0: You're just sort of organizing information.

902
01:08:02,242 --> 01:08:05,916
Speaker 0: It's more like information science and less programming going on, right?

903
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:14,857
Speaker 0: So It's like alright I guess I'll go work at a technology company if I want to make software and actually do a different activity.

904
01:08:15,419 --> 01:08:23,238
Speaker 0: and it you know It makes me think like hey, you know, you think worldwide everyone complains about this developer shortage Which may or may not exist.

905
01:08:24,023 --> 01:08:53,300
Speaker 0: But it really makes sense to be like hey Shouldn't all the you know, having all the engineers right work together at few companies Making solutions that are you know, incredible even if only broadly applicable Makes a lot more sense than having engineers at every company Making kind of mass illusions, right because they don't have the resources and the manpower to make anything amazing.

906
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:54,564
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

907
01:08:55,027 --> 01:08:56,211
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, it's like.

908
01:08:56,270 --> 01:09:00,296
Speaker 0: this is just how it has to be unless the you know Everyone in the world learns how to program.

909
01:09:01,182 --> 01:09:12,551
Speaker 1: Why some percentage of restaurants have a shitty website with like a broken flash link on them and some percentage have a custom website That's janky and the rest have paid some company to manage it for them.

910
01:09:13,252 --> 01:09:16,805
Speaker 0: and some have no website and they're only on you Your grub hubs and whatnot.

911
01:09:16,825 --> 01:09:20,198
Speaker 1: Oh, and if they're not on grow pub and they're not don't have a website.

912
01:09:20,218 --> 01:09:24,283
Speaker 1: as far as I'm concerned They don't exist sure But it's like.

913
01:09:24,303 --> 01:09:32,899
Speaker 0: yeah, it's like, you know, it just makes sense, you know in terms of the economy, you know Forget capitalism just even if you had socialism just efficiency wise economy.

914
01:09:32,979 --> 01:09:35,087
Speaker 0: I have all the engineers, you know.

915
01:09:35,148 --> 01:09:51,160
Speaker 0: not reinventing the wheel working together making better solutions Right, even if they're not bespoke solutions, you know, and then you know, okay if there really does need to be a bespoke solution It can just be a combination or a plug-in or a modification of some existing broader solution, right?

916
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:54,149
Speaker 0: Yeah sales force like I you know, they use the example.

917
01:09:54,189 --> 01:09:57,439
Speaker 0: just because it's so enormous right, you know how many plugins they got going on.

918
01:09:58,182 --> 01:09:58,463
Speaker 0: It's like.

919
01:09:58,784 --> 01:10:10,253
Speaker 0: that's how they they you know have become so big is because they got you know Whatever your if your business doesn't work with the basic version It's like they got plugins and glue and all cut.

920
01:10:10,273 --> 01:10:11,056
Speaker 0: they can make it they'll.

921
01:10:11,137 --> 01:10:12,020
Speaker 0: they have engineers.

922
01:10:12,462 --> 01:10:13,005
Speaker 0: They were like you.

923
01:10:13,025 --> 01:10:21,300
Speaker 0: will you get a contract with them and Salesforce employees will program something to make sure that your business works on their platform.

924
01:10:21,421 --> 01:10:25,920
Speaker 1: I wonder if you and I have both interact with the same people itself on Salesforce over the years.

925
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,165
Speaker 0: There's there's so many people there.

926
01:10:28,386 --> 01:10:29,068
Speaker 0: There's no way.

927
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:37,580
Speaker 0: but that's the thing is they have armies of people doing this one thing It's like there's no point in trying to do anything else and the same goes for all the other SAS solutions.

928
01:10:37,681 --> 01:10:40,295
Speaker 0: Right Google search is a SAS solution, right?

929
01:10:40,335 --> 01:10:41,100
Speaker 0: It's just a free one.

930
01:10:41,743 --> 01:10:45,180
Speaker 0: It's like what kind of search engine are you gonna make you have no chance?

931
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:49,545
Speaker 1: Well SAS take a big rule those all kinds of problems But you have no chance.

932
01:10:49,867 --> 01:10:57,150
Speaker 1: SAS didn't really become as big as it is until Modern web browsers and the modern internet arose.

933
01:10:57,230 --> 01:11:00,360
Speaker 1: before that it was actually really hard to offer this kind of solution.

934
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:08,680
Speaker 1: I was involved in some of this at IBM and you know in earlier internet days a Lot of Citrix involved in software as a server, right?

935
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:19,335
Speaker 0: Well, that's I was gonna say because the like the first thing I mentioned was how hard it is to port and Develop a desktop application that's multi-platform without the web.

936
01:11:19,355 --> 01:11:21,020
Speaker 0: this common, you know.

937
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:23,126
Speaker 0: You write once run anywhere deal.

938
01:11:23,567 --> 01:11:23,888
Speaker 0: It's like.

939
01:11:24,069 --> 01:11:26,316
Speaker 0: your only other option was like a Java thing.

940
01:11:26,336 --> 01:11:33,280
Speaker 1: Yeah my old company We were kind of before that like when I was first there Java web start was how we offered access to our software.

941
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:40,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, you know if you don't have even if you do all your processing on some server somewhere without the web browser.

942
01:11:41,324 --> 01:11:53,491
Speaker 0: You need some sort of client-side application that will give the you know, the person access to that service and If you have to hit multiple platforms You're stuck to make multiple client-side apps and port them.

943
01:11:53,552 --> 01:11:55,139
Speaker 0: and it's it's like you haven't solved.

944
01:11:55,159 --> 01:11:58,518
Speaker 0: you Still have to get a whole bunch of engineers to do that.

945
01:11:58,962 --> 01:12:01,059
Speaker 0: No matter how trivial the client-side app is.

946
01:12:01,702 --> 01:12:08,308
Speaker 0: It's like but the web means you just need some web devs and now you've hit every Possible client device in.

947
01:12:08,529 --> 01:12:11,200
Speaker 0: you know the universe even like an old Apple - or something.

948
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:17,496
Speaker 1: How many websites just hit a whole bunch of basically like web API microservices to do whatever it is.

949
01:12:17,536 --> 01:12:17,977
Speaker 1: They're doing.

950
01:12:17,997 --> 01:12:20,009
Speaker 0: I Mean all of them.

951
01:12:20,151 --> 01:12:22,920
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, basically.

952
01:12:23,943 --> 01:12:26,179
Speaker 0: So, yeah software as a service is like is now.

953
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:34,851
Speaker 0: You know the business model and the technological model that is currently dominant and I think will remain dominant for the foreseeable future.

954
01:12:34,971 --> 01:12:44,060
Speaker 0: right and you know unless Something really drastic would have to change for a different, you know model to take out software as a service.

955
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:50,161
Speaker 1: Yep This is a space that I have been professionally involved in for a long time and expect to continue to be so for a long Time to come.

956
01:12:56,274 --> 01:12:58,519
Speaker 1: this has been geek nights with rim and Scott.
