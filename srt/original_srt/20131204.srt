1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,191
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, December 4th, 2013.

2
00:00:12,191 --> 00:00:12,592
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:13,174
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,255 --> 00:00:14,398
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:18,428
Speaker 0: Tonight, Rumiko Takahashi's primal needs.

6
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:20,312
Speaker 1: Oh, gosh.

7
00:00:20,332 --> 00:00:21,475
Speaker 1: You say it that way.

8
00:00:21,716 --> 00:00:24,162
Speaker 0: Part of the Rumiko Takahashi anthology.

9
00:00:24,182 --> 00:00:26,827
Speaker 0: You might have gotten it in your Genian box.

10
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,232
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

11
00:00:31,818 --> 00:00:35,592
Speaker 0: So I wanted to do something that people don't really do anymore.

12
00:00:35,612 --> 00:00:38,525
Speaker 0: At least, like, hobbyists don't care about it like they used to back in the day.

13
00:00:38,545 --> 00:00:40,933
Speaker 0: I wanted to make a webcam.

14
00:00:42,017 --> 00:00:43,101
Speaker 1: What do you mean make a webcam?

15
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:44,426
Speaker 1: You just get a webcam.

16
00:00:44,466 --> 00:00:44,847
Speaker 0: It's like 10 bucks.

17
00:00:44,867 --> 00:00:45,991
Speaker 1: Yeah, like a 24/7 hosted webcam.

18
00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:50,268
Speaker 1: Oh, well, you could just use your Elgato, right?

19
00:00:50,328 --> 00:00:51,032
Speaker 1: Just hook it up and...

20
00:00:51,193 --> 00:00:51,817
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could.

21
00:00:51,897 --> 00:00:55,677
Speaker 0: So the only way to really do that, the only, like, other than... You have Vios.

22
00:00:55,717 --> 00:00:56,320
Speaker 1: What's the problem?

23
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,908
Speaker 0: So where do you host it?

24
00:00:58,009 --> 00:00:59,095
Speaker 0: Like, there's a lot of options there.

25
00:00:59,135 --> 00:00:59,799
Speaker 0: Where do you host it?

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,442
Speaker 0: How do you host it?

27
00:01:00,462 --> 00:01:01,506
Speaker 1: You can use Twitch, YouTube, whatever.

28
00:01:01,848 --> 00:01:07,869
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you can theoretically make a YouTube live event that never ends.

29
00:01:08,451 --> 00:01:18,029
Speaker 0: But the practical reality of that, based on my experiences with the Elgato software and the heat that the thing generates over time and everything else, not the best option.

30
00:01:18,992 --> 00:01:22,706
Speaker 0: And basically, I was looking around because it's hard to search for that.

31
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:37,327
Speaker 0: Because if you search for anything related to webcam, you mostly find the software people use to make webcams work, like physical webcams, not to run what you used to call a webcam, which meant a camera pointed to something 24/7 that is on a web page for you to look at.

32
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:42,190
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is, the webcam is like the kind that you're looking for, where it's just anyone can look at it anytime.

33
00:01:42,712 --> 00:01:49,117
Speaker 1: Most of those are sold as, like, security cameras where you log into this web site and look at your thing.

34
00:01:49,177 --> 00:01:51,003
Speaker 1: And they're mostly really low.

35
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:54,057
Speaker 1: Even the ones that you see in public, like, look at the panda at the zoo.

36
00:01:54,077 --> 00:01:55,764
Speaker 1: That's set up the same way.

37
00:01:55,885 --> 00:02:00,222
Speaker 1: And it's just... Or... You have to know your IP so you can visit the URL.

38
00:02:00,242 --> 00:02:10,026
Speaker 0: So there's a lot of companies that sell those webcam services, mostly to restaurants and businesses, to have, like, a webcam of your waiting room to see how long it would be to get a table, stuff like that.

39
00:02:10,127 --> 00:02:11,051
Speaker 1: It's all the same stuff.

40
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,485
Speaker 1: The security stuff, the panda thing, and they're all the same.

41
00:02:13,525 --> 00:02:20,577
Speaker 0: But I realized that it was hard to search for when I went and found all the software because there's a lot of software to, like, run Apache and then...

42
00:02:20,617 --> 00:02:22,385
Speaker 1: There's some open source software.

43
00:02:22,747 --> 00:02:30,981
Speaker 1: The thing is, you would just run it as a server and port forward, and then you would have to know your IP of your house, visit it, and then with VLC in a special URL.

44
00:02:31,002 --> 00:02:31,926
Speaker 0: Yeah, but no, that's bullshit.

45
00:02:31,946 --> 00:02:38,493
Speaker 0: I wanted the traditional... You host a website somewhere with HTTP and embedded in that site is a little video.

46
00:02:38,573 --> 00:02:43,554
Speaker 1: Well, you could just put the link embedded in the site with HTML, you know, that special address for VLC.

47
00:02:43,574 --> 00:02:44,237
Speaker 0: Yes, if you have it.

48
00:02:44,518 --> 00:02:48,015
Speaker 1: And then you had, like, a VLC plug-in and then it would appear on the website.

49
00:02:48,176 --> 00:02:53,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm well aware of all those options, but the software that people make to manage the stuff well... It's really...

50
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:56,431
Speaker 1: It's like this software that's pre-installed on your router.

51
00:02:56,632 --> 00:02:57,295
Speaker 1: It's really shitty.

52
00:02:57,315 --> 00:03:01,008
Speaker 0: It really hasn't changed much in the last 15 years.

53
00:03:01,088 --> 00:03:01,891
Speaker 1: No, it hasn't.

54
00:03:02,071 --> 00:03:02,894
Speaker 1: No one cares about that.

55
00:03:02,934 --> 00:03:03,997
Speaker 0: Yeah, no one cares at all.

56
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:12,542
Speaker 0: But what's interesting is that I realized the best way to do this is actually just to use Skype because what I...

57
00:03:12,562 --> 00:03:13,466
Speaker 1: How do you do that?

58
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:16,258
Speaker 1: Because you need the other end to pick up when you call.

59
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,244
Speaker 0: Ah, so get this.

60
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:25,390
Speaker 0: A lot of people use Skype to be a personal secure webcam, and it's actually way more secure than a lot of the other ways to do it.

61
00:03:25,491 --> 00:03:29,450
Speaker 1: Except for, you know, the NSA looking at everything Microsoft wants to show them, which is everything.

62
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:30,636
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, of course, of course.

63
00:03:30,656 --> 00:03:35,193
Speaker 0: Well, I could use, like, PGP phone to encrypt the audio going over that connection.

64
00:03:35,534 --> 00:03:35,815
Speaker 1: Good job.

65
00:03:36,237 --> 00:03:38,948
Speaker 0: Anyway, so what you do is you make a Skype account.

66
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,335
Speaker 0: You don't give it to anyone.

67
00:03:40,355 --> 00:03:41,400
Speaker 0: You don't tell anyone it exists.

68
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:48,146
Speaker 0: Give it to some really obscure name and make it context with the people you want to be able to view your little webcam.

69
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,500
Speaker 0: Like, you want them to be able to log in and look at your video occasionally.

70
00:03:51,521 --> 00:04:04,665
Speaker 0: And then there's an option buried deep in Skype that basically says automatically answer with video any call that comes in and then also check the option to only accept calls from people who are contacts with you.

71
00:04:05,408 --> 00:04:06,352
Speaker 1: Ah, so it's basically.

72
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:09,266
Speaker 1: it doesn't matter if someone figures out the obscure name because it ain't picking up.

73
00:04:09,346 --> 00:04:10,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, it'll never respond.

74
00:04:10,672 --> 00:04:13,726
Speaker 0: So I set this up and I tested it, and it works amazingly.

75
00:04:13,806 --> 00:04:14,851
Speaker 1: I'm sure it works just fine.

76
00:04:14,911 --> 00:04:15,775
Speaker 0: So now I have a lot.

77
00:04:15,795 --> 00:04:16,458
Speaker 0: I have access.

78
00:04:16,498 --> 00:04:18,406
Speaker 0: I didn't know about that auto pickup option.

79
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:19,831
Speaker 1: Neither did I. It's the option.

80
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:24,490
Speaker 1: So now, so any number of people can call it once and let's keep picking up and making new.

81
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:32,820
Speaker 0: I think if someone else if you call while someone else is already called in, either it kicks one of them out or it kicks the other one out.

82
00:04:32,861 --> 00:04:33,906
Speaker 1: It doesn't make a group.

83
00:04:34,188 --> 00:04:38,064
Speaker 1: So suddenly you've got two people attached to each other like, oh, I don't think three way.

84
00:04:38,084 --> 00:04:40,512
Speaker 0: I got to test a little more to find out.

85
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,820
Speaker 0: But it works surprisingly well.

86
00:04:42,961 --> 00:04:45,913
Speaker 0: Now I have a bunny cam to check on the bunnies when we're off at conventions.

87
00:04:46,677 --> 00:04:52,223
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm sure it works well, but I don't know, you know, technologically, I guess it could be a better option, but you know what?

88
00:04:52,544 --> 00:04:58,828
Speaker 0: There are no better options that don't either cost a lot of money and still probably suck because they reek of enterprise.

89
00:04:58,868 --> 00:05:00,834
Speaker 1: I still like the VLC URL method.

90
00:05:00,854 --> 00:05:02,359
Speaker 0: Yeah, but VLC is.

91
00:05:04,142 --> 00:05:08,261
Speaker 1: the only problem with that is you got to use dynamic DNS or know your house's IP and hope it doesn't change.

92
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:09,766
Speaker 0: Skype comes with net busting.

93
00:05:10,348 --> 00:05:10,849
Speaker 1: That's true.

94
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:17,471
Speaker 0: Also, I got to trust the security of the VLC stuff or roll my own authentication.

95
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:19,879
Speaker 1: Oh, you know what you could do?

96
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:20,743
Speaker 0: Skype's authentication.

97
00:05:20,803 --> 00:05:24,923
Speaker 1: Here's the way you could do it with your without worrying about your house's net busting, right?

98
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:29,963
Speaker 0: You could just do port forwarding and stuff because I know there's a better way to do it, right?

99
00:05:30,846 --> 00:05:34,277
Speaker 1: The computer that has the VLC running, right?

100
00:05:34,337 --> 00:05:35,080
Speaker 1: The stream running.

101
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,101
Speaker 1: Yeah, you VPN that computer to like your web hosting somewhere that you already have no matter.

102
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:41,225
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

103
00:05:41,245 --> 00:05:44,737
Speaker 1: And then you just connect to your web host and there it is.

104
00:05:44,797 --> 00:05:47,608
Speaker 1: It's like it's running on your web host all the time.

105
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:47,809
Speaker 1: Yeah.

106
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:50,218
Speaker 0: And you have the VPN originate from home.

107
00:05:50,238 --> 00:05:55,559
Speaker 0: So even if your dynamic IP from your ISP changes, it'll always reinitiate and still write.

108
00:05:55,579 --> 00:05:59,194
Speaker 1: So you VPN to your web host from the Starbucks where you're at.

109
00:05:59,254 --> 00:06:03,634
Speaker 1: And then it's like the computer in your house is with VLC is on your same land as you.

110
00:06:03,674 --> 00:06:05,161
Speaker 1: And then you just type in its address and you're good.

111
00:06:05,302 --> 00:06:10,965
Speaker 0: So, yeah, you kids who only subscribe to Wednesday and anime, manga, comics, take that technology.

112
00:06:11,005 --> 00:06:11,487
Speaker 1: Boom.

113
00:06:11,568 --> 00:06:13,295
Speaker 0: That's what Monday gig nights is like.

114
00:06:13,335 --> 00:06:14,219
Speaker 0: It's actually pretty cool.

115
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:19,281
Speaker 1: Subscribe to that one to the one that we make the least except Thursday, which you make even less.

116
00:06:19,784 --> 00:06:22,175
Speaker 0: I could do some more Thursdays if we just talk more about politics.

117
00:06:22,838 --> 00:06:24,347
Speaker 1: I think there might be mentoring next Thursday.

118
00:06:24,368 --> 00:06:24,690
Speaker 1: We'll see.

119
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,454
Speaker 0: We'll figure it out.

120
00:06:25,776 --> 00:06:27,062
Speaker 0: Like we said, it's the holiday season.

121
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:27,544
Speaker 0: There's trouble.

122
00:06:27,865 --> 00:06:29,390
Speaker 0: So, uh, got any news?

123
00:06:29,992 --> 00:06:30,896
Speaker 1: Do I have news?

124
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:32,522
Speaker 1: I do, in fact, have news.

125
00:06:32,562 --> 00:06:38,186
Speaker 1: There's this company that people don't know a lot about and I didn't know a lot about until recently called Picture Box.

126
00:06:38,748 --> 00:06:42,882
Speaker 1: And they're basically a publisher of incredibly niche artsy fartsy books.

127
00:06:43,384 --> 00:06:43,605
Speaker 1: Right.

128
00:06:44,107 --> 00:06:48,321
Speaker 1: So why do we care about this company, Picture Box and their artsy fartsy books?

129
00:06:48,462 --> 00:06:49,907
Speaker 1: Besides, maybe some of them are cool.

130
00:06:49,967 --> 00:06:56,429
Speaker 1: Well, some of them were super cool, like crazy weird mangas and shit, including one Tezuka manga.

131
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:06,167
Speaker 1: And I ordered it before they went out of business, which is the news that they're going out of business so you can loot them for 50% off pretty much everything they've got.

132
00:07:07,211 --> 00:07:11,329
Speaker 1: And some of this stuff is crazy cool and I kind of want it, but I kind of don't want to spend money.

133
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:13,821
Speaker 0: Yeah, I also don't want stuff to take up space in my apartment.

134
00:07:13,861 --> 00:07:14,444
Speaker 0: Exactly.

135
00:07:14,464 --> 00:07:23,858
Speaker 0: I mean, I just took every anime DVD I owned except for some things that are in crazy efficient box sets and threw away all the clamshells and art and goodies.

136
00:07:23,998 --> 00:07:25,142
Speaker 1: I did that years ago.

137
00:07:25,162 --> 00:07:26,267
Speaker 0: Yeah, I finally did it.

138
00:07:26,809 --> 00:07:27,391
Speaker 0: Good God.

139
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:29,801
Speaker 0: That was like three garbage bags of crap I got rid of.

140
00:07:30,222 --> 00:07:31,548
Speaker 0: And now there's one tiny binder.

141
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:36,548
Speaker 1: I'm going to get, I saved up a bunch of Amazon boxes and I'm going to start mailing stuff to Amazon to sell.

142
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:37,553
Speaker 1: So we'll see.

143
00:07:37,955 --> 00:07:43,297
Speaker 0: So speaking of companies going out of business, Scott and I relatively recently discovered Rune Factory.

144
00:07:43,317 --> 00:07:44,421
Speaker 1: I didn't discover it recently.

145
00:07:44,441 --> 00:07:45,848
Speaker 1: I played Rune Factory 2.

146
00:07:45,848 --> 00:07:46,471
Speaker 1: I didn't beat it though.

147
00:07:46,772 --> 00:07:48,722
Speaker 0: Oh, see, I'd never played any of those games.

148
00:07:48,762 --> 00:07:51,473
Speaker 1: It's Harvest Moon, but also Dating and also Dungeons.

149
00:07:51,593 --> 00:07:51,834
Speaker 0: Yeah.

150
00:07:51,955 --> 00:07:55,090
Speaker 0: Three awesome things that on their own can be kind of lame, but together.

151
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,191
Speaker 1: Yeah.

152
00:07:55,693 --> 00:07:58,267
Speaker 1: It's one of those games where it's like, it's not really linear.

153
00:07:58,287 --> 00:08:00,458
Speaker 1: It's just sort of do whatever, but there's so much to do.

154
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:01,683
Speaker 1: It's like, there's always something to do.

155
00:08:01,904 --> 00:08:02,145
Speaker 1: Yeah.

156
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:04,595
Speaker 0: So I'd started playing it.

157
00:08:04,715 --> 00:08:05,418
Speaker 0: It's pretty fun.

158
00:08:05,438 --> 00:08:07,425
Speaker 1: Like Rune Factory 4, you're playing the new one.

159
00:08:07,465 --> 00:08:07,827
Speaker 1: Yeah.

160
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:09,011
Speaker 0: Like the old ones.

161
00:08:09,894 --> 00:08:10,135
Speaker 0: Yeah.

162
00:08:10,235 --> 00:08:15,195
Speaker 0: And Neverland, the company that developed it, bankrupt, suspends operations, done.

163
00:08:15,215 --> 00:08:16,881
Speaker 1: A lot of people like Rune Factory had to go bankrupt.

164
00:08:16,922 --> 00:08:18,950
Speaker 0: Japanese video game developer Neverland Co.

165
00:08:19,091 --> 00:08:23,615
Speaker 0: Limited announced on his website that the company is suspending operations, blah, blah, blah, bankruptcy.

166
00:08:23,635 --> 00:08:24,722
Speaker 0: I guess they didn't get enough sales.

167
00:08:24,802 --> 00:08:25,345
Speaker 1: I was helping.

168
00:08:25,426 --> 00:08:25,908
Speaker 1: I bought it.

169
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:27,537
Speaker 0: According to the Anime News Network.

170
00:08:27,718 --> 00:08:28,863
Speaker 0: Well, remember, they're just the developer.

171
00:08:28,903 --> 00:08:30,069
Speaker 0: Like other people own the IP.

172
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:30,571
Speaker 1: Yeah.

173
00:08:30,612 --> 00:08:31,757
Speaker 1: I never heard of Neverland.

174
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,284
Speaker 1: Like on the box it says XSeed.

175
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,087
Speaker 1: What's the deal with that?

176
00:08:34,227 --> 00:08:35,172
Speaker 0: That's the publisher.

177
00:08:35,332 --> 00:08:35,554
Speaker 1: Okay.

178
00:08:35,573 --> 00:08:36,840
Speaker 1: So who published Harvest Moon?

179
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,482
Speaker 1: Who makes that?

180
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:38,486
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

181
00:08:38,527 --> 00:08:41,339
Speaker 1: So it's not the same developer for Harvest Moon as it is for...

182
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:41,821
Speaker 0: No.

183
00:08:42,102 --> 00:08:42,804
Speaker 0: Neverland here.

184
00:08:42,865 --> 00:08:44,371
Speaker 0: I got the Anime News Network article up.

185
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:47,603
Speaker 0: So Neverland is also known for Shining Force.

186
00:08:48,165 --> 00:08:49,329
Speaker 1: That's a popular game.

187
00:08:49,349 --> 00:08:49,530
Speaker 0: Yeah.

188
00:08:49,771 --> 00:08:50,373
Speaker 0: Lufia.

189
00:08:50,553 --> 00:08:51,075
Speaker 1: That's huge.

190
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:54,067
Speaker 0: You can already see there's kind of a trend to the kinds of games they work on.

191
00:08:54,127 --> 00:08:54,308
Speaker 1: Right.

192
00:08:54,328 --> 00:08:59,511
Speaker 1: But all these games are, they're not like super Final Fantasy level, but they're like one step under.

193
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:01,439
Speaker 1: These are big, relatively big games.

194
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:01,640
Speaker 1: Yeah.

195
00:09:02,101 --> 00:09:08,945
Speaker 0: According to the Anime News Network article here, and I keep saying Anime News Network because I'm just reading from their press release.

196
00:09:09,005 --> 00:09:10,690
Speaker 0: I did no independent research on this.

197
00:09:11,111 --> 00:09:13,940
Speaker 0: So blah, blah, blah.

198
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,105
Speaker 0: Neverland apologized.

199
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,250
Speaker 0: So they're a Japanese company.

200
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:16,833
Speaker 0: We're sorry.

201
00:09:16,853 --> 00:09:18,078
Speaker 1: There won't be a Rune Factory 5, kids.

202
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:20,565
Speaker 0: Recent, okay.

203
00:09:20,605 --> 00:09:26,246
Speaker 0: The announcement that in recent years the industry had changed and as a result the company's sales have been sluggish.

204
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:36,018
Speaker 0: They added that they had tons of loans that were hard to repay and they had some sources of funding, but then that all backed out and they're done.

205
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:38,991
Speaker 1: Well, I know you anime kids also tend to like JRPGs.

206
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,518
Speaker 1: That seems to be the popular, most popular genre.

207
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,445
Speaker 0: There's like no comments on this article.

208
00:09:42,525 --> 00:09:43,608
Speaker 0: No one seems to care.

209
00:09:43,869 --> 00:09:53,126
Speaker 1: Anyway, but Lufia is a really interesting JRPG because even though it's pretty typical, walk around, fight monsters, random encounters, buy loot, equip items, right?

210
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:59,292
Speaker 1: It's really interesting because the very beginning of the game, you're basically the ultimate badass is saving the world.

211
00:09:59,352 --> 00:10:02,849
Speaker 1: Like from the get-go, it's like you're already a zillion levels and crazy invincible.

212
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:04,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, you get into a battle, you've had all these powers.

213
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:07,372
Speaker 1: Right, you battle like the super boss immediately.

214
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:11,190
Speaker 1: And the first time I played it, I was like, this is the best ever and no leveling up.

215
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:14,423
Speaker 1: I'm just going to be a badass the whole time and it's going to be badass as fighting.

216
00:10:14,444 --> 00:10:23,210
Speaker 1: And then as soon as you beat that boss, it gives you your real characters, which are the sons and daughters of the characters you just were.

217
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:29,071
Speaker 1: And they're mad weak and you have to level up and become as strong as your parents and fuck that.

218
00:10:29,152 --> 00:10:31,522
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's interesting they let you do that.

219
00:10:31,883 --> 00:10:38,389
Speaker 0: Lufia also just, I know a lot of people who outgrew JRPGs, you know, like you do and you have a life and things to do.

220
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:42,806
Speaker 1: And the only Luns that are still playable are Chrono Trigger and Chrono Trigger and Earth Band.

221
00:10:43,047 --> 00:10:50,232
Speaker 0: Lufia has such, the people who liked Lufia, you'll know Lufia fans because they have a whole bunch of Lufia swag to this day.

222
00:10:50,473 --> 00:10:51,618
Speaker 1: Oh, they also like Lunar.

223
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,684
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh my god, Lunar and Lufia.

224
00:10:53,704 --> 00:10:56,391
Speaker 0: It's like the two L's of this JRPG.

225
00:10:56,411 --> 00:11:00,282
Speaker 1: I know a dude named Lu who likes Lunar.

226
00:11:00,302 --> 00:11:04,513
Speaker 0: I was about to bring Lu up as an example.

227
00:11:04,854 --> 00:11:07,581
Speaker 1: Lufia also begins with Lu, I wonder if he likes it.

228
00:11:07,681 --> 00:11:12,315
Speaker 0: But Lufia people have the same kind of connection that Lunar people do.

229
00:11:12,335 --> 00:11:14,603
Speaker 0: And other than Chrono Trigger.

230
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:17,015
Speaker 1: Same thing with like Breath of Fire people or whatever.

231
00:11:17,055 --> 00:11:21,695
Speaker 0: Breath of Fire people really don't deserve to continue to, those games are bad guys, I'm sorry.

232
00:11:21,735 --> 00:11:22,639
Speaker 1: Or Thousand Arms people.

233
00:11:23,301 --> 00:11:25,048
Speaker 0: Nobody remembers Thousand Arms.

234
00:11:25,088 --> 00:11:27,057
Speaker 0: Were there even any sequels to Thousand Arms?

235
00:11:27,117 --> 00:11:27,760
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

236
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:28,441
Speaker 1: Anyway.

237
00:11:30,448 --> 00:11:33,899
Speaker 0: I remember I was amazed when someone explained to me what Thousand Arms was.

238
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,264
Speaker 0: Like, never conceived.

239
00:11:35,304 --> 00:11:37,513
Speaker 1: It's not much different from Rune Factory.

240
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:38,216
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

241
00:11:38,256 --> 00:11:45,319
Speaker 0: But back then, in like freshman year of RIT, I'd never conceived of mixing dating game with Final Fantasy.

242
00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:47,187
Speaker 1: I wish Rune Factory was also a puzzle game.

243
00:11:47,408 --> 00:11:48,070
Speaker 1: That'd be the best.

244
00:11:48,552 --> 00:11:50,961
Speaker 0: Or maybe some mappings, Metrian Odyssey, mix that in.

245
00:11:52,202 --> 00:11:53,444
Speaker 1: So yeah, every game at once.

246
00:11:53,945 --> 00:12:04,642
Speaker 0: There are only seven comments on this article on the bankrupt.

247
00:12:05,305 --> 00:12:10,346
Speaker 0: And some of the first posts are, I don't know how to feel, I like this game, but I don't really know anything.

248
00:12:10,888 --> 00:12:12,875
Speaker 0: There's one guy who knows a shit ton about it.

249
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:14,501
Speaker 0: But then there's a comment.

250
00:12:14,521 --> 00:12:15,625
Speaker 1: How many fedoras is he wearing?

251
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,916
Speaker 0: He knows about it for real, no fedora.

252
00:12:19,478 --> 00:12:23,015
Speaker 0: Like, For Real knows about it, talks about who owns the IP, it's a company called Marvelous.

253
00:12:23,297 --> 00:12:25,006
Speaker 0: He knows the people who work at the company.

254
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:28,805
Speaker 1: Oh, so a different company owns the IP, so someone else could develop Rune Factory 5 easily.

255
00:12:29,046 --> 00:12:29,327
Speaker 1: Yes.

256
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:30,150
Speaker 1: Okay, whatever.

257
00:12:30,391 --> 00:12:32,097
Speaker 0: So, there's a comment here.

258
00:12:32,117 --> 00:12:33,301
Speaker 0: that's kind of amazing to me.

259
00:12:34,023 --> 00:12:36,150
Speaker 0: Since I've never owned a Nintendo console.

260
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,577
Speaker 1: Then why are you commenting on this?

261
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:41,987
Speaker 0: I've only ever played the once Rune Factory game.

262
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,397
Speaker 0: But I loved Oceans, blah blah blah.

263
00:12:45,818 --> 00:12:52,324
Speaker 0: We're at a point in the world where there are people who will grow up having never owned or used a Nintendo console and won't be missing much.

264
00:12:53,988 --> 00:12:56,214
Speaker 1: Except the entire NES and SNES library.

265
00:12:56,615 --> 00:12:59,986
Speaker 0: Does it count as owning an NES if you just use an emulator?

266
00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:02,316
Speaker 1: No, but you still gotta play that shit.

267
00:13:02,376 --> 00:13:05,504
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can play it, but they'll never own a Nintendo console.

268
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:06,105
Speaker 1: Oh, that's fine.

269
00:13:11,856 --> 00:13:14,260
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

270
00:13:16,742 --> 00:13:23,246
Speaker 0: So, we're sure that we talked about this on Geek Nights probably as a thing of the day at some point in the past.

271
00:13:23,347 --> 00:13:24,210
Speaker 1: I'm almost 99% sure.

272
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:25,515
Speaker 0: I'm also pretty sure.

273
00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:28,025
Speaker 1: But it could have been one of those episodes that was lost.

274
00:13:28,346 --> 00:13:30,352
Speaker 0: It also could be that we're just wrong.

275
00:13:31,075 --> 00:13:33,102
Speaker 0: Like, maybe we just talked about it.

276
00:13:33,222 --> 00:13:34,226
Speaker 1: I am so positive.

277
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:37,277
Speaker 1: this is already a thing of the day or news or something.

278
00:13:37,377 --> 00:13:44,660
Speaker 0: So if you believe that this is a duplicate and you're mad about that, by all means, please send us the link.

279
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,229
Speaker 1: Help us find the episode where we talked about this already.

280
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,257
Speaker 0: So, Prince Rupert's Drop.

281
00:13:49,277 --> 00:13:51,805
Speaker 0: This is a video that explains it.

282
00:13:52,146 --> 00:14:01,012
Speaker 0: Basically, if you take some glass and melt it and drop it in water, the thing that comes out is actually kind of crazy and awesome.

283
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:07,010
Speaker 0: It's crazy and awesome in a way that this video really, really expresses well.

284
00:14:07,531 --> 00:14:08,494
Speaker 0: That's all science.

285
00:14:08,555 --> 00:14:08,956
Speaker 0: It's cool.

286
00:14:09,196 --> 00:14:09,658
Speaker 0: Check it out.

287
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:11,703
Speaker 1: I also have a science thing of day.

288
00:14:12,606 --> 00:14:24,877
Speaker 1: So, if I take some water and I have two cups of water and I pour the cups of water together into one cup, two bodies of water now form one body of water.

289
00:14:24,978 --> 00:14:26,342
Speaker 0: Two cups, one body.

290
00:14:26,703 --> 00:14:27,065
Speaker 1: Right.

291
00:14:27,406 --> 00:14:31,562
Speaker 1: They combine because the water molecules don't know which body of water they belong to.

292
00:14:31,682 --> 00:14:34,530
Speaker 1: So, it all becomes one body of water, right?

293
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,011
Speaker 1: Obvious.

294
00:14:35,653 --> 00:14:41,091
Speaker 1: What if I take a bar of copper and another bar of copper and I touch them together?

295
00:14:41,573 --> 00:14:45,607
Speaker 1: Shouldn't the atoms of copper be confused about which bar they belong to?

296
00:14:45,788 --> 00:14:47,815
Speaker 1: How does they stay apart from each other?

297
00:14:47,835 --> 00:14:51,088
Speaker 0: Now, I was wrong when Scott posed this question to me.

298
00:14:51,108 --> 00:14:53,076
Speaker 0: I tried to come up with something.

299
00:14:53,096 --> 00:14:55,504
Speaker 1: Well, you could be right if Feynman is wrong.

300
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:55,865
Speaker 0: Yeah.

301
00:14:56,206 --> 00:14:56,867
Speaker 1: Unlikely.

302
00:14:58,612 --> 00:14:59,273
Speaker 0: Unlikely.

303
00:14:59,294 --> 00:15:00,677
Speaker 0: Well, yeah.

304
00:15:00,757 --> 00:15:04,551
Speaker 0: I tried to come up with some rationale having to do with adhesion and cohesion.

305
00:15:04,592 --> 00:15:04,913
Speaker 0: Right.

306
00:15:04,933 --> 00:15:06,218
Speaker 1: It's something so obvious.

307
00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:17,450
Speaker 1: Like, you don't even think to ask this question, but as soon as someone asks you this question, like, why do two bars of copper or iron or whatever not just merge together like two cups of water, right?

308
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:26,970
Speaker 1: And you answer is incredibly surprising.

309
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,256
Speaker 1: So, I'm just going to link to it.

310
00:15:28,296 --> 00:15:31,204
Speaker 1: You should read it because it will blow your mind.

311
00:15:31,244 --> 00:15:37,035
Speaker 1: Like, that much blowing.

312
00:15:37,196 --> 00:15:38,137
Speaker 0: Yep.

313
00:15:38,158 --> 00:15:39,400
Speaker 0: You know, Feynman was good at that.

314
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,483
Speaker 1: That's what he does.

315
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:41,547
Speaker 0: Yeah.

316
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,270
Speaker 0: That's his thing.

317
00:15:42,712 --> 00:15:44,860
Speaker 0: Yo, did you ever think about this?

318
00:15:46,441 --> 00:15:46,721
Speaker 1: Okay.

319
00:15:47,042 --> 00:15:47,442
Speaker 0: Okay.

320
00:15:48,004 --> 00:15:49,847
Speaker 0: In the metamoment, the book club book is?

321
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:51,009
Speaker 0: Aideru.

322
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:51,851
Speaker 1: Yes.

323
00:15:51,931 --> 00:15:53,013
Speaker 1: By William Gibson.

324
00:15:53,093 --> 00:15:57,142
Speaker 0: It might seem cliche.

325
00:15:57,563 --> 00:15:59,269
Speaker 0: Don't give me any crap about this.

326
00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:01,676
Speaker 0: like super cliche cyberpunk setting.

327
00:16:01,737 --> 00:16:03,862
Speaker 1: This cliche Shakespeare.

328
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:09,672
Speaker 0: Two young lovers separated.

329
00:16:10,113 --> 00:16:11,556
Speaker 1: All right.

330
00:16:11,836 --> 00:16:12,017
Speaker 0: Yep.

331
00:16:12,357 --> 00:16:13,800
Speaker 1: I've read this story a million times.

332
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:24,526
Speaker 0: Since it's Wednesday, don't forget that we have an ongoing series, Gig Nights Presents, Shoujo Kakamei Utena, where we're talking at length about the allegory and symbolism and cool things you might not notice.

333
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:28,062
Speaker 0: And the incredibly obvious non-metaphorical parts.

334
00:16:28,102 --> 00:16:28,464
Speaker 0: Yes.

335
00:16:29,227 --> 00:16:30,432
Speaker 1: The car is a metaphor for sex.

336
00:16:30,452 --> 00:16:32,320
Speaker 1: The straight forward plot as well.

337
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,448
Speaker 0: The car is both metaphor for sex and literal sex.

338
00:16:35,549 --> 00:16:36,552
Speaker 0: Yes.

339
00:16:37,274 --> 00:16:39,360
Speaker 1: I'm making videos of games and Netrunner.

340
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,021
Speaker 1: Yeah.

341
00:16:40,524 --> 00:16:43,360
Speaker 1: People seem to like them, but those are people who like Netrunner.

342
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:47,650
Speaker 0: Otherwise, check us out at MAGFest.

343
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,776
Speaker 0: It's coming up real soon.

344
00:16:48,816 --> 00:16:51,508
Speaker 0: We're going to be on a bunch of panels.

345
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:53,134
Speaker 0: They're going to be panel discussion.

346
00:16:53,194 --> 00:16:59,880
Speaker 0: So other people will be sitting on these panels with us and we're just going to be argumentative and jerks like we are every year.

347
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,224
Speaker 0: So come enjoy the spectacle.

348
00:17:01,244 --> 00:17:03,592
Speaker 1: And the concerts.

349
00:17:03,913 --> 00:17:04,074
Speaker 0: Yep.

350
00:17:04,295 --> 00:17:05,098
Speaker 0: We'll be at the concerts.

351
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:08,348
Speaker 0: We'll be doing stuff, hanging out, doing our thing.

352
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:11,138
Speaker 0: PAX East is a ways off, but we're going to be at that.

353
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,185
Speaker 0: PAX Prime's a ways off.

354
00:17:13,205 --> 00:17:13,888
Speaker 0: We're going to be at that.

355
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:14,733
Speaker 0: Anime Boston.

356
00:17:14,954 --> 00:17:16,000
Speaker 0: Anime Boston's a ways off.

357
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,723
Speaker 0: We're going to be at that.

358
00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:18,012
Speaker 1: Kineticon, you can submit panels.

359
00:17:18,193 --> 00:17:20,587
Speaker 0: Kineticon panel submissions have been open for months.

360
00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:21,310
Speaker 1: Yeah.

361
00:17:21,371 --> 00:17:21,792
Speaker 1: Take that.

362
00:17:21,854 --> 00:17:23,060
Speaker 1: We're going to start scheduling shit.

363
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:24,202
Speaker 1: July, right?

364
00:17:24,301 --> 00:17:24,603
Speaker 1: Yeah.

365
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:30,260
Speaker 0: So submit your panels, ye all, and read every word in the submission.

366
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,784
Speaker 0: We've cleaned up a lot of things, so there's no more confusion about who gets a badge and how many badges.

367
00:17:37,025 --> 00:17:38,189
Speaker 0: But I was promised a badge.

368
00:17:38,229 --> 00:17:39,312
Speaker 0: It's all sorted out now.

369
00:17:39,713 --> 00:17:41,700
Speaker 0: So you can't get badges.

370
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,060
Speaker 0: you're not supposed to get, but you're also going to get a badge if you're supposed to get a badge.

371
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:45,563
Speaker 1: That's right.

372
00:17:46,367 --> 00:17:48,680
Speaker 1: And you will know if you're supposed to get one or not beforehand.

373
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:49,180
Speaker 1: Yep.

374
00:17:50,244 --> 00:17:52,994
Speaker 1: Is there anything else in the meta?

375
00:17:53,335 --> 00:17:54,037
Speaker 0: No, not really.

376
00:17:54,078 --> 00:17:57,591
Speaker 0: Just check out our stuff, join our awesome forum, which is reinvigorated.

377
00:17:57,812 --> 00:18:07,883
Speaker 0: And if you want to play some Counter-Strike, I think maybe tomorrow might play a little bit of Counter-Strike in the evening on the official Thursday.

378
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:10,211
Speaker 0: The official Geek Nights Counter-Strike server.

379
00:18:10,412 --> 00:18:11,194
Speaker 1: Tomorrow's Thursday?

380
00:18:11,676 --> 00:18:12,037
Speaker 0: Yes.

381
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:29,238
Speaker 1: After you're done playing Counter-Strike on the official Geek Nights Counter-Strike server at 9pm New York time, you should come to the official Geek Nights IRC channel, and in your other window on your computer, open up Jan Saltybet, so that we can have a chat during the Saltybet.

382
00:18:29,278 --> 00:18:32,308
Speaker 1: that is not inside the Saltybet chat, so you can read it.

383
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:33,111
Speaker 0: Yo, dog.

384
00:18:33,311 --> 00:18:40,615
Speaker 1: We've been doing this for every Shaker Classic for the past month or so, so more people showing up would be cool.

385
00:18:40,895 --> 00:18:47,767
Speaker 0: Now perhaps between the Saltybetting and the Counter-Striking, you should watch the new Kill La Kill, so we can all talk about it in between Saltybets.

386
00:18:47,847 --> 00:18:48,350
Speaker 0: That's right.

387
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,781
Speaker 0: Why aren't there Kill La Kill characters in Saltybet yet?

388
00:18:50,801 --> 00:18:52,246
Speaker 1: Because go make one.

389
00:18:52,486 --> 00:18:55,717
Speaker 0: Yeah, I looked at how to make one of them.

390
00:18:55,737 --> 00:18:56,800
Speaker 0: Emily said it would be easy.

391
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,121
Speaker 0: Nope.

392
00:18:57,362 --> 00:18:58,326
Speaker 1: So Emily, you do it.

393
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,957
Speaker 0: I delved into that documentation.

394
00:19:01,037 --> 00:19:01,519
Speaker 0: I was like, all right.

395
00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:02,664
Speaker 1: Talking like it's so easy.

396
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,392
Speaker 0: I never said it was easy.

397
00:19:04,412 --> 00:19:08,606
Speaker 1: You should even do the easy character, the sidekick girl, and not the main character.

398
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:10,912
Speaker 0: I'll just do Senketsu.

399
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:11,815
Speaker 0: It's just him.

400
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:13,760
Speaker 1: Oh, it's even easier.

401
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:14,781
Speaker 0: Yeah, or the dog.

402
00:19:14,801 --> 00:19:17,767
Speaker 1: Just the dog.

403
00:19:17,787 --> 00:19:18,469
Speaker 0: Oh, guts.

404
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:20,132
Speaker 1: Anyway.

405
00:19:20,433 --> 00:19:30,104
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Scott ordered a ridiculous- Okay, so Crunchyroll does this thing where they're like, it's also the TRSI that does this with Crunchyroll, right?

406
00:19:30,164 --> 00:19:31,630
Speaker 1: It's basically teamed up.

407
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,979
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure the Crunchyroll store is just TRSI.

408
00:19:34,721 --> 00:19:40,002
Speaker 1: Anyway, they do this thing where it's like, buy a box of mystery manga, like 20 bucks, tons of manga.

409
00:19:40,042 --> 00:19:43,460
Speaker 1: And it's all the shit from the discount rack at the conventions that no one ever buys.

410
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,326
Speaker 1: And they did the same thing with DVDs.

411
00:19:45,386 --> 00:19:46,129
Speaker 1: And I said, you know what?

412
00:19:46,491 --> 00:19:48,941
Speaker 1: This will be on adventure and kind of fun.

413
00:19:48,961 --> 00:19:49,463
Speaker 1: So I'll do it.

414
00:19:49,503 --> 00:19:50,667
Speaker 1: I gave them like 25 bucks.

415
00:19:50,988 --> 00:19:53,597
Speaker 1: They sent me a box of like a zillion DVDs.

416
00:19:53,617 --> 00:19:58,295
Speaker 1: So, of course, I think it was between 99 and a hundred percent.

417
00:19:58,355 --> 00:19:59,720
Speaker 1: genie on and pioneer DVDs.

418
00:19:59,941 --> 00:20:01,626
Speaker 0: This is a treasure.

419
00:20:01,847 --> 00:20:02,469
Speaker 0: You know what this is?

420
00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:07,827
Speaker 0: This is a box ready made to be at an anime con dealers room under the table.

421
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:12,185
Speaker 1: Dude, if you bought a bunch of these boxes, you could just be an anime con dealer immediately.

422
00:20:12,426 --> 00:20:13,371
Speaker 0: One dollar, one dollar.

423
00:20:13,391 --> 00:20:14,597
Speaker 1: You wouldn't make any money on them.

424
00:20:14,718 --> 00:20:16,204
Speaker 0: One dollar, silent service.

425
00:20:16,646 --> 00:20:19,016
Speaker 1: If I sold them for a dollar each, I'd maybe break even.

426
00:20:19,056 --> 00:20:21,084
Speaker 1: But no, then I had to pay for the table at the convention.

427
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:23,452
Speaker 1: Anyway, and that's only if I sold out.

428
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:26,423
Speaker 1: Yeah, so some of the DVDs and they were good.

429
00:20:26,443 --> 00:20:28,070
Speaker 1: I got like a random lane DVD.

430
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:30,218
Speaker 1: Oh, and I got not DVD one.

431
00:20:30,238 --> 00:20:35,175
Speaker 1: There are some lupin DVDs and there were some random couple X DVDs.

432
00:20:35,215 --> 00:20:36,740
Speaker 1: I guess you want to watch that X TV.

433
00:20:38,601 --> 00:20:39,725
Speaker 1: But mostly it's just garbage.

434
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:45,609
Speaker 1: One of the DVDs in there was Rumiko Takahashi Anthology, which and there's three DVDs of that.

435
00:20:45,629 --> 00:20:46,775
Speaker 1: And I only got one or two of them.

436
00:20:46,835 --> 00:20:52,377
Speaker 1: And I don't know which ones, but I also knew that rim for some reason already owned one of the DVDs of that.

437
00:20:52,437 --> 00:20:53,862
Speaker 1: It may be one that was in the box.

438
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,170
Speaker 1: Maybe the missing one or one?

439
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:56,731
Speaker 1: I don't have.

440
00:20:56,832 --> 00:20:59,139
Speaker 0: I cannot tell or remember.

441
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:01,949
Speaker 1: I have to go home and check where I got this thing.

442
00:21:02,872 --> 00:21:03,855
Speaker 0: I don't know if I bought it.

443
00:21:04,016 --> 00:21:06,063
Speaker 1: As far as I know, you just always had it.

444
00:21:06,103 --> 00:21:07,971
Speaker 1: Like it's always been on the DVD show.

445
00:21:08,031 --> 00:21:09,156
Speaker 1: I know forever.

446
00:21:09,176 --> 00:21:13,336
Speaker 0: In fact, if you look at pictures of the old geek house, like you'll see it there on the DVD show.

447
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,382
Speaker 0: It's sitting there in that.

448
00:21:14,422 --> 00:21:16,873
Speaker 1: I do not know when it appeared or from whence it came.

449
00:21:16,994 --> 00:21:18,320
Speaker 0: It's like right next to Horatio.

450
00:21:18,681 --> 00:21:23,000
Speaker 1: There's some, there's some, you may have bought it at like an early convention for a discount rack.

451
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,072
Speaker 0: There's usually a lens man VHS tape hanging out right nearby.

452
00:21:26,092 --> 00:21:26,895
Speaker 1: That's exactly right.

453
00:21:27,457 --> 00:21:27,738
Speaker 0: Yeah.

454
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,567
Speaker 0: So Rumik theater, Rumiko Takahashi.

455
00:21:31,651 --> 00:21:34,259
Speaker 0: Guys, you should know who Rumiko Takahashi is.

456
00:21:34,439 --> 00:21:35,222
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know what?

457
00:21:35,282 --> 00:21:38,392
Speaker 1: She has not been as popular as late.

458
00:21:38,553 --> 00:21:42,266
Speaker 1: It's like, she was huge, huge, huge, huge, the biggest deal.

459
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:43,993
Speaker 1: And now she's sort of faded.

460
00:21:44,073 --> 00:21:45,720
Speaker 1: Like what has she done recently today?

461
00:21:46,141 --> 00:21:46,723
Speaker 1: Don't know who that is.

462
00:21:46,883 --> 00:21:47,806
Speaker 0: American fandom.

463
00:21:48,127 --> 00:21:50,715
Speaker 0: She was pretty much only known and Inuyasha.

464
00:21:50,735 --> 00:21:52,922
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's it.

465
00:21:53,223 --> 00:21:56,781
Speaker 0: Now, if you were an anime fan who actually paid attention, you probably knew her from her.

466
00:21:56,862 --> 00:22:01,989
Speaker 0: Say it's her first, of course, or at least you knew her for those three things, but those are like the three biggest, right?

467
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,879
Speaker 1: And then I guess Maison Ikkoku comes in fourth.

468
00:22:05,161 --> 00:22:06,246
Speaker 0: I really like Maison Ikkoku.

469
00:22:06,266 --> 00:22:07,169
Speaker 1: I know that's your jam.

470
00:22:07,249 --> 00:22:16,015
Speaker 0: I read all of Maison Ikkoku off the shelf by being a manga cow in media play, media play, talk Walden books.

471
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:21,590
Speaker 1: I remember you reading the last one in media play because it was a long manga series.

472
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:22,372
Speaker 0: It took me years.

473
00:22:23,535 --> 00:22:33,834
Speaker 0: So Rumik theater is one of her things because she, if you can say anything about her, I'm not going to say that I'm a huge fan of her work because it gets kind of some of her work.

474
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:34,938
Speaker 1: I really like some of it.

475
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:37,667
Speaker 0: It gets kind of repetitive and same.

476
00:22:37,687 --> 00:22:40,436
Speaker 1: A lot of similarities between the works.

477
00:22:40,697 --> 00:22:40,957
Speaker 0: Yep.

478
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:46,032
Speaker 0: Inuyasha just goes on and on and on and on and fucking, oh my God.

479
00:22:46,433 --> 00:22:50,667
Speaker 0: Ranma starts out just really funny and as it goes on, it's still funny.

480
00:22:50,687 --> 00:22:54,239
Speaker 1: It's sort of the same thing over and over again.

481
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,594
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that I think Ranma peaked in the episode with the other bird.

482
00:22:57,715 --> 00:22:58,920
Speaker 1: That's the only episode.

483
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,547
Speaker 1: That's one of the only episodes I've seen.

484
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,036
Speaker 1: I've seen maybe five episodes.

485
00:23:02,056 --> 00:23:08,144
Speaker 1: Consider yourself privileged because that's the one that anime club always showed because it was a Christmas episode technically.

486
00:23:08,365 --> 00:23:08,928
Speaker 0: Technically.

487
00:23:09,008 --> 00:23:10,615
Speaker 1: And it was like the best ones anyway.

488
00:23:10,635 --> 00:23:10,776
Speaker 1: Yeah.

489
00:23:10,816 --> 00:23:15,654
Speaker 0: We'd also show that, oh my God, that Kimigori orange road Christmas thing.

490
00:23:15,674 --> 00:23:16,377
Speaker 1: I never watched that.

491
00:23:16,577 --> 00:23:18,986
Speaker 0: Oh my God, we should review all those old shows.

492
00:23:19,046 --> 00:23:20,231
Speaker 0: Marmalade boy, let's do it.

493
00:23:20,713 --> 00:23:22,179
Speaker 1: You're all by yourself.

494
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,727
Speaker 0: Have you ever seen Marmalade boy?

495
00:23:23,747 --> 00:23:27,183
Speaker 1: If we're going to do one of those, we should do koto cha first because it's actually funny.

496
00:23:27,524 --> 00:23:28,448
Speaker 0: Okay, I could do that.

497
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:29,171
Speaker 1: Go get it.

498
00:23:29,512 --> 00:23:30,797
Speaker 0: All right, I'll get it somehow.

499
00:23:31,239 --> 00:23:37,320
Speaker 0: So yeah, Rumic Theater is a manga that she, I wanted to say did, but it's actually still going.

500
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,887
Speaker 0: It's been going for almost as long as I've been alive.

501
00:23:40,048 --> 00:23:40,469
Speaker 0: Whoa.

502
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:45,343
Speaker 0: Original run 1987 through ongoing volumes four.

503
00:23:45,543 --> 00:23:49,029
Speaker 1: So it's as old as my brother.

504
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,677
Speaker 0: But it was animated.

505
00:23:54,378 --> 00:24:02,049
Speaker 0: Not all of it obviously, but there was turned into sort of this slice of life episodic anime thing that a bunch of got these DVDs of and never watch.

506
00:24:02,069 --> 00:24:04,623
Speaker 0: And they just seem to be, you'll see them in the bargain bins everywhere.

507
00:24:04,683 --> 00:24:09,604
Speaker 0: And after all these years, finally decided to watch one because I've never actually read Rumic Theater.

508
00:24:09,624 --> 00:24:10,828
Speaker 0: I've read her other stuff.

509
00:24:11,009 --> 00:24:11,911
Speaker 1: I've never read it either.

510
00:24:12,774 --> 00:24:19,234
Speaker 0: So we watched one episode of Rumiko Takahashi anthology, the first one, which is title.

511
00:24:19,254 --> 00:24:25,891
Speaker 0: Well, the DVD is titled prime primal desires, primal, primal.

512
00:24:25,911 --> 00:24:27,276
Speaker 0: I already forget you forget.

513
00:24:27,296 --> 00:24:29,223
Speaker 1: It's something like that, but yeah, I don't know.

514
00:24:29,243 --> 00:24:32,995
Speaker 1: the title of the episode is the tragedy of P. Oh, there you go.

515
00:24:34,219 --> 00:24:36,183
Speaker 1: Tragedy of P kidney stones.

516
00:24:36,223 --> 00:24:36,584
Speaker 1: The end.

517
00:24:38,027 --> 00:24:47,597
Speaker 0: So if I had to say anything about this anime series ignoring the manga, ignoring any other about this single episode, we don't know.

518
00:24:47,617 --> 00:24:51,049
Speaker 1: the other episodes are like extrapolating solely from this one episode.

519
00:24:51,852 --> 00:24:56,702
Speaker 0: I would say that it is extremely Rumiko Takahashi.

520
00:24:58,146 --> 00:25:01,013
Speaker 1: I guess it's named after is Rumic theater.

521
00:25:01,093 --> 00:25:04,000
Speaker 0: It's got her kind of trademark humor.

522
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,951
Speaker 0: The character designs are just like straight up her thing.

523
00:25:06,991 --> 00:25:14,826
Speaker 0: You show anyone who knows anything about anime, any still from the show and they'll be like, Oh, that's probably Rumiko Takahashi, something, something or someone who's copying her.

524
00:25:15,027 --> 00:25:16,913
Speaker 0: Yeah.

525
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:21,108
Speaker 0: And it's just like kind of a slow slice of life that doesn't really have much of a plot.

526
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:22,795
Speaker 1: I think it has a plot.

527
00:25:22,836 --> 00:25:23,840
Speaker 1: The plot just doesn't resolve.

528
00:25:24,661 --> 00:25:24,942
Speaker 1: Right.

529
00:25:25,022 --> 00:25:30,224
Speaker 1: It's what you have here is it's like a story about the normal real life everyday happenings.

530
00:25:30,344 --> 00:25:34,526
Speaker 1: Nothing really crazy except for the fact that there's a penguin there, but that's not impossible.

531
00:25:34,546 --> 00:25:36,273
Speaker 0: And the penguin is totally normal penguins.

532
00:25:36,314 --> 00:25:36,936
Speaker 0: Not magical.

533
00:25:37,157 --> 00:25:39,523
Speaker 1: It's like pen pen.

534
00:25:39,543 --> 00:25:39,784
Speaker 1: Yeah.

535
00:25:39,944 --> 00:25:41,068
Speaker 0: But dumber than pen pen.

536
00:25:41,088 --> 00:25:42,071
Speaker 0: More like a real penguin.

537
00:25:42,492 --> 00:25:44,739
Speaker 1: Pen pens bigger than P. Yeah.

538
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:47,428
Speaker 0: But pen pens also smarter than P. That's true.

539
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:50,117
Speaker 1: Pen pen is like iron basically.

540
00:25:50,137 --> 00:25:50,438
Speaker 0: Yeah.

541
00:25:50,518 --> 00:25:52,024
Speaker 0: Pen pens are smart anyway.

542
00:25:52,044 --> 00:25:58,029
Speaker 1: Uh, but yeah, it's just about a family that lives in an apartment complex and like apartment complex drama.

543
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:58,832
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

544
00:25:58,853 --> 00:25:59,837
Speaker 1: You're not allowed to have pets.

545
00:25:59,897 --> 00:26:00,239
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

546
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:00,922
Speaker 1: They have a penguin.

547
00:26:00,962 --> 00:26:01,485
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

548
00:26:01,746 --> 00:26:04,640
Speaker 0: All of this could have been resolved by punching that one lady in the face.

549
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,683
Speaker 0: She was the problem.

550
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:13,490
Speaker 1: So basically the conflict is this one lady's a bitch and is actually trying to enforce the pet law, but no one, the pet rule, not law.

551
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:17,403
Speaker 1: And no one cares about it except these old biddies.

552
00:26:17,664 --> 00:26:21,098
Speaker 1: And it's a typical homeowner's association, but it's a Japanese.

553
00:26:21,138 --> 00:26:25,873
Speaker 0: homeowners associate that Rubik theater C is so Japanese.

554
00:26:25,913 --> 00:26:36,248
Speaker 0: Like the way they, the, the residents of this place, this apartment building confront each other is the most like passive aggressive, creepy thing you'll ever see.

555
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:36,629
Speaker 0: Yeah.

556
00:26:36,991 --> 00:26:38,375
Speaker 1: Like, but it's so real.

557
00:26:38,416 --> 00:26:42,554
Speaker 1: That's why it's, it's like, you know, people say slice of life and they focus on the slice.

558
00:26:42,595 --> 00:26:43,580
Speaker 1: I'm focusing on the life.

559
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,051
Speaker 1: Like this is true to life, even though it's animated.

560
00:26:46,191 --> 00:26:46,392
Speaker 0: Yep.

561
00:26:46,432 --> 00:27:03,900
Speaker 0: Like little touches that you might like, for example, the, the, the wife comes home and there's a habitual problem where her son will make a bunch of noise and then the same bitch lady will come upstairs and in the most passive aggressive way manner complain, she'll be like, uh, your son must be really excited today.

562
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,752
Speaker 0: And you stand there stone faced, waiting for a response.

563
00:27:07,374 --> 00:27:13,476
Speaker 0: And then after the apology, she'll be like, she'll apologize in response to the main character's apology.

564
00:27:13,496 --> 00:27:18,377
Speaker 1: It's like, I try to tolerate it about four out of five times, but sometimes I really just have to come up here.

565
00:27:18,437 --> 00:27:20,022
Speaker 0: I apologize for that.

566
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:31,456
Speaker 0: But the, so the kids are all in the apartment and the mother comes home and the camera just pans down as she sees all the shoes piled up in the entryway.

567
00:27:31,476 --> 00:27:32,279
Speaker 0: And she's like, oh fuck.

568
00:27:34,021 --> 00:27:36,935
Speaker 0: And that's not something that would happen like much of America.

569
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:41,914
Speaker 1: So it's, it's a ridiculous situation and the thing is ridiculous, but it doesn't resolve.

570
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:43,319
Speaker 1: It's just sort of like the end.

571
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:47,719
Speaker 1: So to summarize the full plot, this woman, they, you're just going to no need to watch it.

572
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,643
Speaker 1: We'll just summarize it for you.

573
00:27:48,663 --> 00:27:49,768
Speaker 0: We'll just summarize it for you.

574
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:54,988
Speaker 0: Cause it, cause it goes, it has a secretive space moment at the end.

575
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:57,095
Speaker 0: It goes all, it goes all free Willy.

576
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:59,584
Speaker 0: And then it goes all, I don't even know.

577
00:27:59,604 --> 00:28:01,490
Speaker 0: I don't even know where it goes.

578
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:01,891
Speaker 0: I guess.

579
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:02,232
Speaker 0: Yeah.

580
00:28:02,694 --> 00:28:15,019
Speaker 0: So basically this woman, this old woman is being kicked out of her apartment building because she had a little dog and the homeowner's association found out about it and they made her leave.

581
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:15,882
Speaker 0: and she's like, it's fine.

582
00:28:15,922 --> 00:28:16,665
Speaker 0: I love my dogs.

583
00:28:16,685 --> 00:28:17,608
Speaker 0: I'll just live somewhere else.

584
00:28:18,431 --> 00:28:20,900
Speaker 0: And then this bitch lady is there.

585
00:28:21,421 --> 00:28:27,620
Speaker 0: And then we explore the bitch lady's life and how she doesn't want anyone to have pets or be happy.

586
00:28:28,981 --> 00:28:38,734
Speaker 0: And the reason for this ends up being because she had a pet and she had to give him up because she moved into an apartment building and she followed the rules.

587
00:28:38,754 --> 00:28:46,966
Speaker 1: So now she's making sure everyone else follows the rule instead of when she could just be nice and not get rid of the stupid rule, but she's going to be a bitch instead.

588
00:28:46,986 --> 00:28:49,175
Speaker 0: And it's actually pretty funny.

589
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:50,782
Speaker 0: Like this is actually enjoyable.

590
00:28:50,983 --> 00:28:53,273
Speaker 1: The scene with the penguin in the space is funny.

591
00:28:53,695 --> 00:28:53,936
Speaker 0: Okay.

592
00:28:53,956 --> 00:28:58,491
Speaker 0: Well the other parts to him, we laughed because it's that sort of slice of life humor.

593
00:28:58,532 --> 00:29:08,185
Speaker 0: Like the mom's reactions to this woman and the way characters sort of say like this at one point, the, the, the bitch woman's kid is actually really smart.

594
00:29:08,586 --> 00:29:13,245
Speaker 0: And she, the mother needs the kid to lie to his mother about the presence of this penguin.

595
00:29:13,305 --> 00:29:14,993
Speaker 1: And the kid does cause he's good.

596
00:29:15,094 --> 00:29:24,387
Speaker 0: The kid totally does, but this is a great scene where she's the, the mom is behind the bitch lady and she's just like frantically gesturing to the kid to lie.

597
00:29:24,969 --> 00:29:28,542
Speaker 0: And her own son is kind of dumb and doesn't quite get that they're lying.

598
00:29:28,562 --> 00:29:30,552
Speaker 0: And then the other kid's like, ah, let's just get out of here.

599
00:29:30,592 --> 00:29:30,853
Speaker 0: Come on.

600
00:29:31,295 --> 00:29:33,263
Speaker 0: But no, just go, well, I'll tell you later.

601
00:29:35,189 --> 00:29:39,942
Speaker 0: So then they have this weird discussion about like what it means to be a pet.

602
00:29:40,384 --> 00:29:47,048
Speaker 0: And then she takes the penguin outside and then we get like three solid minutes of panning shots of galaxies.

603
00:29:47,129 --> 00:29:47,229
Speaker 1: Yeah.

604
00:29:47,249 --> 00:29:48,778
Speaker 1: I think they're trying to the message.

605
00:29:48,818 --> 00:29:50,806
Speaker 1: I think she's trying to give us with the story.

606
00:29:50,887 --> 00:29:54,000
Speaker 1: is that look, you know, the rule is there for a reason.

607
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:59,623
Speaker 1: It disturbs neighbors, but mostly it's not fair to the pet to make it live in an apartment where it's all cooped up.

608
00:29:59,643 --> 00:30:00,870
Speaker 1: Look, you set the penguin free.

609
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:01,835
Speaker 1: You took it out for a walk.

610
00:30:01,895 --> 00:30:02,840
Speaker 1: Now look how happy it is.

611
00:30:03,582 --> 00:30:04,244
Speaker 0: Ah, space.

612
00:30:04,826 --> 00:30:09,099
Speaker 0: But you could take the penguin for a walk and have it live in an apartment.

613
00:30:09,139 --> 00:30:09,742
Speaker 0: It would be fine.

614
00:30:09,782 --> 00:30:10,545
Speaker 0: And also the pet.

615
00:30:10,565 --> 00:30:11,791
Speaker 0: that's the big crisis point.

616
00:30:11,831 --> 00:30:13,558
Speaker 0: in the middle of this thing is a cat.

617
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:16,310
Speaker 0: Cats are perfectly fine living in houses and apartments.

618
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,434
Speaker 1: That's exactly right.

619
00:30:18,117 --> 00:30:32,190
Speaker 0: But I cannot express to you the sheer dissonance between what this appears to be about, which is just passive aggressive lady being extremely passive aggressive and causing trouble for her neighbors and not getting any comeuppance or learning any lessons whatsoever.

620
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:32,492
Speaker 0: Yep.

621
00:30:32,733 --> 00:30:33,938
Speaker 0: Her plot never resolves.

622
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,563
Speaker 0: She still is complete.

623
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:46,286
Speaker 0: She's, you know, she's like, she's like the bad woman in the beginning of the looks like her acts like her.

624
00:30:46,307 --> 00:30:56,408
Speaker 0: And even in the end, when they get rid of the penguin anyway, because the owner, the owner comes back, she's like, if you'd still had the penguin the next day, I would have filed a formal complaint.

625
00:30:56,468 --> 00:30:57,111
Speaker 1: Go fuck yourself.

626
00:30:57,191 --> 00:30:59,642
Speaker 0: I was just waiting for someone to hit her.

627
00:30:59,863 --> 00:31:00,284
Speaker 0: Yeah.

628
00:31:00,405 --> 00:31:01,550
Speaker 1: I don't know why that didn't happen.

629
00:31:02,253 --> 00:31:05,365
Speaker 1: Uh, but yeah, the real thing is here based on this episode, right?

630
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:09,179
Speaker 1: Do you want to watch more Rumu Kota Gaiji's anthology?

631
00:31:09,239 --> 00:31:11,307
Speaker 0: A little, you know what this show is good for?

632
00:31:11,749 --> 00:31:17,172
Speaker 0: This is the kind of show that if it was on crunchy roll, you're watching an episode every now and then over dinner.

633
00:31:17,233 --> 00:31:22,254
Speaker 1: I think, yeah, I definitely think it's definitely on the same level as like, uh, folk tales and whatnot.

634
00:31:22,415 --> 00:31:24,483
Speaker 1: It's just modern ish folk tale.

635
00:31:24,904 --> 00:31:27,435
Speaker 0: It's also because it's old and people haven't heard of it.

636
00:31:27,455 --> 00:31:34,729
Speaker 0: No one's going to watch it, but I think if you put it on crunchy roll and kind of pushed it the same way you'd push those other kinds of crunchy roll, go search for it.

637
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:35,151
Speaker 0: I don't know.

638
00:31:35,613 --> 00:31:38,566
Speaker 0: I pretty much only watch kill la kill right now on crunchy roll.

639
00:31:38,586 --> 00:31:39,450
Speaker 1: That's about it.

640
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:39,591
Speaker 1: Yeah.

641
00:31:39,892 --> 00:31:40,756
Speaker 0: Until kill la kill.

642
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:45,397
Speaker 1: And also the biking show, but no one else should watch that unless you really fucking love biking.

643
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:48,549
Speaker 1: It is the most generic anime ever to exist.

644
00:31:48,609 --> 00:31:51,600
Speaker 1: You should find the generic anime for the thing that you like instead.

645
00:31:52,281 --> 00:32:02,133
Speaker 0: But I find interestingly that that statement about this very episodic slice of life show applies to all of Rumiko Takahashi's anime adaptations.

646
00:32:02,775 --> 00:32:09,414
Speaker 0: I mean, Ranma is really funny, but if you try to watch it in order, like every episode, it's awful.

647
00:32:10,377 --> 00:32:11,240
Speaker 0: It's the kind of show.

648
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,568
Speaker 0: It's like the Simpsons just, Oh, Hey, it's on.

649
00:32:13,628 --> 00:32:15,094
Speaker 0: Let's watch an episode.

650
00:32:15,676 --> 00:32:17,301
Speaker 0: Have we seen every episode at this point?

651
00:32:17,361 --> 00:32:18,003
Speaker 0: Who cares?

652
00:32:19,708 --> 00:32:23,098
Speaker 1: I guess Inuyasha maybe has to be in order, but really?

653
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:23,519
Speaker 1: No.

654
00:32:23,659 --> 00:32:25,127
Speaker 1: It's like, they got crystal number one.

655
00:32:25,187 --> 00:32:26,675
Speaker 1: All right, I'll let's watch them get crystal number 35.

656
00:32:26,675 --> 00:32:26,756
Speaker 1: Okay.

657
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,987
Speaker 1: I believe you forget crystal number 10.

658
00:32:28,987 --> 00:32:29,690
Speaker 1: Now crystal number 1,072.

659
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:33,265
Speaker 0: That show is more, they get crystal number one.

660
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,570
Speaker 0: There's only one crystal.

661
00:32:35,132 --> 00:32:35,473
Speaker 0: Yay.

662
00:32:35,514 --> 00:32:36,156
Speaker 0: We've won.

663
00:32:36,176 --> 00:32:36,838
Speaker 0: Oops.

664
00:32:36,979 --> 00:32:39,147
Speaker 0: And then it shatters into like a billion crystals.

665
00:32:39,228 --> 00:32:39,449
Speaker 1: Right.

666
00:32:39,469 --> 00:32:40,071
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

667
00:32:40,111 --> 00:32:40,372
Speaker 0: Yeah.

668
00:32:40,975 --> 00:32:45,236
Speaker 0: It's just, you got to watch like the first two and then you can watch the episodes in any order.

669
00:32:45,577 --> 00:32:47,545
Speaker 0: And it's the same way with all these shows.

670
00:32:48,768 --> 00:32:58,742
Speaker 0: But I think a lot of anime fans who hear about an old famous show, like a Ranma one half or Ursa Yatsura, they'll try to watch it the way they watch the anime they like today.

671
00:32:59,103 --> 00:33:02,034
Speaker 0: They'll try to just start on episode one and power through it.

672
00:33:02,054 --> 00:33:02,696
Speaker 0: I do.

673
00:33:03,017 --> 00:33:09,180
Speaker 1: Most of the anime that is translated, brought over, marketed heavily, pushed heavily and become popular.

674
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:13,558
Speaker 1: Most of those are either, are shows that are serial regardless of length.

675
00:33:13,598 --> 00:33:18,539
Speaker 1: It could be a one piece that's super long or an attack on Titan that's short, but they're all serials.

676
00:33:18,639 --> 00:33:26,345
Speaker 1: And the anime, there are plenty of anime that are more like Simpsons where it's completely episodic and a million episodes.

677
00:33:26,486 --> 00:33:26,706
Speaker 0: Right.

678
00:33:26,766 --> 00:33:30,196
Speaker 1: But those anime, you know, uh, detective Conan, right?

679
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:37,441
Speaker 1: Those anime tend not to be brought over to the U S except I think Lupin is the most of all that was brought over.

680
00:33:37,903 --> 00:33:40,270
Speaker 1: And that one is also pushed less heavily.

681
00:33:40,531 --> 00:33:40,892
Speaker 0: Right.

682
00:33:41,694 --> 00:33:43,620
Speaker 1: So, and this is just one of those though.

683
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:53,239
Speaker 0: This one is much, much shorter, which is interesting because in regular American TV for a long time, there was a huge push to have things that were as episodic as possible.

684
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,228
Speaker 1: You can syndicate them in any order and not give a fuck.

685
00:33:55,389 --> 00:34:00,714
Speaker 0: But yet anime fans were kind of a niche market and they were really focused on the shows that they would just power through.

686
00:34:01,437 --> 00:34:04,328
Speaker 0: Granted, I know the hardcore people who will power through a show like Ranma.

687
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:05,994
Speaker 1: Go you?

688
00:34:06,074 --> 00:34:06,415
Speaker 1: Yep.

689
00:34:06,897 --> 00:34:07,780
Speaker 1: Has nothing better to do?

690
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,449
Speaker 0: Well, I guess that was the only anime you had.

691
00:34:10,811 --> 00:34:11,112
Speaker 1: Sure.

692
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,020
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't know if I would have or not.

693
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:18,112
Speaker 0: The only reason I didn't was that it was $40 for one VHS tape of Ranma.

694
00:34:18,132 --> 00:34:22,242
Speaker 1: I spent $25 for just a million DVDs.

695
00:34:22,322 --> 00:34:23,563
Speaker 0: It was 30.

696
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:24,927
Speaker 0: If I was willing to watch the dub.

697
00:34:31,098 --> 00:34:33,665
Speaker 0: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

698
00:34:33,685 --> 00:34:37,301
Speaker 0: Thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and brand.

699
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:37,661
Speaker 0: Okay.

00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:38,525
