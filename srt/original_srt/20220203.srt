1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:08,840
Speaker 0: 

2
00:00:08,882 --> 00:00:10,710
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, February 3rd, 2022.

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:10,951
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:13,984 --> 00:00:14,479
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,762
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

6
00:00:15,783 --> 00:00:23,140
Speaker 1: Tonight on the Geek Nights Book Club, we review the first novel, The Tale of Genji.

7
00:00:25,184 --> 00:00:26,218
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

8
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:35,760
Speaker 1: So I think more so than other book club books, this one deserves a little bit of a meta preamble.

9
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:47,620
Speaker 0: Well, so first of all, according to the Geek Nights website database, we announced that this was the book club book on June of 2019.

10
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,845
Speaker 1: June 20th, 2019, which 2019 was a thousand years ago.

11
00:00:49,845 --> 00:00:50,928
Speaker 1: 2019 was a different world.

12
00:00:57,201 --> 00:00:58,263
Speaker 0: Yeah.

13
00:00:58,924 --> 00:01:06,660
Speaker 0: So basically, you know, the world went to poop and also the book itself is hard to read and lots of things happened.

14
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,063
Speaker 0: It was interesting.

15
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:14,220
Speaker 1: I didn't actually like we'd announced it in June and usually when we start a new book club book, like I don't actually start reading it right away.

16
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,284
Speaker 1: Like I'd wait a few weeks.

17
00:01:15,646 --> 00:01:19,160
Speaker 1: I started reading it and we'll talk about like what that was like.

18
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:25,040
Speaker 1: But in terms of just the meta part and I was plugging along, I was like seven or eight chapters in like slow and steady.

19
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,800
Speaker 0: I was enjoying it, but I had 50 some odd chapters, so that's not bad.

20
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:39,920
Speaker 1: And I was reading it mostly like when I was commuting or like sitting at a restaurant, like at lunch, like at work, like I'd sit at a restaurant for an hour having my lunch and I'd read for an hour.

21
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,820
Speaker 1: And then we'd go on trips.

22
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,623
Speaker 0: I was reading it mostly.

23
00:01:42,643 --> 00:01:46,880
Speaker 0: I had the Kindle app on my phone and then I would open it on the subway.

24
00:01:48,444 --> 00:01:48,865
Speaker 1: Yep.

25
00:01:48,885 --> 00:01:52,395
Speaker 1: That was one, especially early chapters of Genji, two subway trips.

26
00:01:52,475 --> 00:01:54,320
Speaker 1: You could finish a chapter actually.

27
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:59,380
Speaker 0: But that's also why I hadn't start reading it right away because in June I was biking to work.

28
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:00,462
Speaker 0: Yep.

29
00:02:00,844 --> 00:02:01,165
Speaker 0: Same.

30
00:02:01,507 --> 00:02:04,060
Speaker 1: So I started reading it on the subway toward the end.

31
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,221
Speaker 0: I didn't start reading it until like September 2019.

32
00:02:07,221 --> 00:02:07,481
Speaker 0: Yep.

33
00:02:07,822 --> 00:02:17,600
Speaker 1: But then, as you all know, in March the world shut down and everything changed and for about a year I didn't read a lot.

34
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,928
Speaker 1: Like we talked about this on Geek Nights a bunch, but it was this weird situation I'd never been in in.

35
00:02:22,988 --> 00:02:30,760
Speaker 1: like my life up to this point where most of the time I would spend reading was like traveling or like laying on a beach.

36
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:40,460
Speaker 1: Like all the all the context I had where I would generally sit down and read for a long period of time fiction, all those activities disappeared from my life because of COVID.

37
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:43,780
Speaker 1: Plus the world was weird and stressful, especially in those early days.

38
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:52,360
Speaker 1: Like it's it's easy to not really internalize how stressful those first like six months were when none of us know knew how this was going to go.

39
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,180
Speaker 1: So, yeah, a lot of things got in our way of reading this book, not just the book itself.

40
00:02:59,161 --> 00:03:06,900
Speaker 0: You know, a lot of times you see like professional athletes give interviews like I don't want to make excuses, but here I'm like, let's make some perfectly valid excuses.

41
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,045
Speaker 0: You got a valid excuse?

42
00:03:08,065 --> 00:03:10,680
Speaker 0: You know, don't give me invalid excuses.

43
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:16,080
Speaker 0: But listen, if you have valid excuses for things, use them as long as they're valid.

44
00:03:16,341 --> 00:03:18,419
Speaker 0: It's like, OK, like valid excuse.

45
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,480
Speaker 1: This book would have taken us a while without COVID.

46
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:31,880
Speaker 1: It wouldn't have taken us this long, but based on the based on the trajectory we had before COVID, we would have done this show probably like summer of 2020.

47
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,323
Speaker 1: Like, really?

48
00:03:32,343 --> 00:03:34,580
Speaker 0: That's what it would be more like late.

49
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,311
Speaker 1: If there had been zero COVID by August 31st, I think it's plausible.

50
00:03:39,331 --> 00:03:44,121
Speaker 1: we would have done the show definitely by the end of the year 2020.

51
00:03:44,121 --> 00:03:47,400
Speaker 0: But anyway, now that I finished it, my appetite for reading has returned voraciously.

52
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,640
Speaker 0: The next book club book, which I guess we announced at the end of the show as per usual.

53
00:03:52,622 --> 00:03:54,239
Speaker 0: I'm already 80 percent done.

54
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,360
Speaker 1: Well, because you seem to have thought that I had already read it, but no, Emily read it and I was really excited to read it.

55
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:00,304
Speaker 1: And I bought it.

56
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:03,600
Speaker 1: I read one chapter and thought, holy shit, this is the next book club book.

57
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,879
Speaker 0: The prologue or the first chapter?

58
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,527
Speaker 1: Well, the prologue.

59
00:04:05,587 --> 00:04:06,640
Speaker 1: I didn't actually even get to the first.

60
00:04:06,901 --> 00:04:10,000
Speaker 1: I read the prologue and based on what I do from Emily, this book is so up our alley.

61
00:04:10,921 --> 00:04:14,880
Speaker 0: Anyway, so tale again, gee, we finally read this whole damn book.

62
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:19,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is the first novel ever written by any person.

63
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:28,960
Speaker 0: There were many long forms of literature, both of fictional literature before the tale of Genji, such as like, I don't know, the Odyssey, which he already did the book club on.

64
00:04:29,341 --> 00:04:30,852
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the Odyssey.

65
00:04:30,912 --> 00:04:32,040
Speaker 0: Odyssey is an epic poem.

66
00:04:32,284 --> 00:04:32,999
Speaker 0: It's like a novel.

67
00:04:33,402 --> 00:04:35,140
Speaker 1: Also, it was not written as a book.

68
00:04:35,221 --> 00:04:37,020
Speaker 1: It was an oral tradition later transcribed.

69
00:04:38,063 --> 00:04:39,079
Speaker 0: Yep, exactly.

70
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:50,777
Speaker 1: And also it was, what's really fascinating is it was like the Odyssey was around 725 BC and the tale of Genji is around 1000 AD.

71
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,221
Speaker 0: Yep.

72
00:04:54,786 --> 00:04:55,492
Speaker 0: So 1700 years apart.

73
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:03,100
Speaker 1: But meanwhile, Rome didn't fall until about 400 years after the tale of Genji was written.

74
00:05:04,461 --> 00:05:09,560
Speaker 0: So did Rome have novels or did they not receive the invention of the novel yet?

75
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:21,720
Speaker 1: Well, that's something that it's an aside that I think about a lot and I wish history books did, like history classes did more was sort of always zoom out from any zoomed in lesson to just talk about the state of the entire world at some time.

76
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:26,400
Speaker 1: Like America's cowboys were a very short time, but like what was going on to the rest of the world?

77
00:05:27,504 --> 00:05:28,619
Speaker 1: Not what a lot of people think.

78
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:35,220
Speaker 1: But anyway, so the tale of Genji is extremely notable and important for a lot of reasons.

79
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:40,938
Speaker 1: And honestly, it should be studied in school all around the world, as it often is.

80
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:54,320
Speaker 0: I'm kind of annoyed that people whose entire job, including like, you know, the translator and many other people, where all they do is study the tale of Genji, you know, the same way that like, you know, rabbis study the Torah.

81
00:05:55,321 --> 00:06:08,520
Speaker 0: They just have this is like they're a significant portion of their lives is studying, you know, this single book, and not just the story itself, but the entire context around it, you know, historically, culturally, etc.

82
00:06:09,241 --> 00:06:19,340
Speaker 0: Because you have this extremely long book, written by a person at a time in history, right further in the past than any other such work.

83
00:06:19,981 --> 00:06:29,660
Speaker 0: And just by your by reading it, and you know, looking at other physical artifacts surrounding it, you can learn a whole lot about, you know, that era and what was going down.

84
00:06:30,462 --> 00:06:33,372
Speaker 0: And that's actually how I decided to make this the book club book is.

85
00:06:33,432 --> 00:06:35,419
Speaker 0: I went there was a I had heard of the book.

86
00:06:37,061 --> 00:06:40,248
Speaker 0: And I had a general idea of what its deal was.

87
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:45,060
Speaker 0: But then they had an exhibit at the Met Museum over in Manhattan.

88
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:49,591
Speaker 0: And since I live in New York City, one morning, I think I woke up on like a weekend.

89
00:06:50,032 --> 00:06:53,000
Speaker 0: And Twitter was like, I had known the exhibit was there.

90
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:58,092
Speaker 0: But I think Twitter or something reminded me that like, it was the last weekend for the exhibit.

91
00:06:58,112 --> 00:06:59,997
Speaker 0: So I'm like, I got nothing to do.

92
00:07:00,037 --> 00:07:00,999
Speaker 0: And you want to just go over there.

93
00:07:01,059 --> 00:07:01,340
Speaker 0: All right.

94
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,325
Speaker 0: Just got on the train and went over there.

95
00:07:03,405 --> 00:07:05,131
Speaker 0: Just check it out.

96
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:05,372
Speaker 0: Right.

97
00:07:05,412 --> 00:07:07,700
Speaker 0: We went, you know, and I checked it out.

98
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:09,966
Speaker 0: And I learned a lot of things there.

99
00:07:10,026 --> 00:07:13,919
Speaker 0: that will probably be discussed if, you know, in the second episode about this book.

100
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:20,613
Speaker 0: But after doing that, going to that exhibit, I was like, well, I guess I should make this the book club book.

101
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:21,135
Speaker 0: Right.

102
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:22,820
Speaker 0: We can read this and I need to choose one.

103
00:07:23,923 --> 00:07:27,120
Speaker 0: So, you know, I don't remember what the previous book club book was.

104
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,286
Speaker 1: Actually, so we have done a grand total of.

105
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:34,975
Speaker 1: I was looking at our book club book history, trying to remember.

106
00:07:35,016 --> 00:07:35,737
Speaker 1: We've done 29 books.

107
00:07:37,561 --> 00:07:40,819
Speaker 1: And the one we did before this was Pages of Pain, it looks like.

108
00:07:41,622 --> 00:07:42,003
Speaker 0: Oh, OK.

109
00:07:42,043 --> 00:07:46,333
Speaker 0: So I mean, on the one hand, that's more books than I thought.

110
00:07:46,374 --> 00:07:48,920
Speaker 0: But on the other hand, in 15, that's two books a year.

111
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,607
Speaker 0: That's not a great rate.

112
00:07:50,647 --> 00:07:52,053
Speaker 1: We did a lot pretty quickly.

113
00:07:52,073 --> 00:07:53,760
Speaker 0: Let's get it up to four books a year.

114
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,203
Speaker 1: I feel like four is a good.

115
00:07:55,223 --> 00:07:57,551
Speaker 1: We did a lot like densely for a while.

116
00:07:57,591 --> 00:08:00,320
Speaker 0: I don't mean I don't mean getting the average up to four books a year.

117
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,527
Speaker 0: That'll mean we'll have to do eight books a year for a while.

118
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:06,299
Speaker 0: I mean, just get the rate from here on out up to four books a year.

119
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,299
Speaker 1: Yeah, because part of the joy is reading a book like together, like we're assuming you read the book, too.

120
00:08:12,581 --> 00:08:16,219
Speaker 1: If you didn't, you're going to have no idea what we're talking about coming soon.

121
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,261
Speaker 0: Yeah, spoilers.

122
00:08:17,321 --> 00:08:21,651
Speaker 1: Genji dies like two thirds of the way through this thing, like both.

123
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,255
Speaker 1: later than I expected based on.

124
00:08:23,315 --> 00:08:25,540
Speaker 1: I learned that he dies in the middle of the book early on.

125
00:08:25,861 --> 00:08:26,722
Speaker 1: And I was kind of waiting.

126
00:08:26,943 --> 00:08:27,644
Speaker 1: When's he going to die?

127
00:08:27,685 --> 00:08:28,426
Speaker 1: When's he going to die?

128
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:34,379
Speaker 1: But also there is more book after he dies than I expected there to be.

129
00:08:37,022 --> 00:08:38,005
Speaker 1: But yeah, lots of spoilers.

130
00:08:38,025 --> 00:08:43,679
Speaker 1: But also we're like one, I have to refer to notes to really remember which character is which.

131
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,392
Speaker 1: And I frequently was mistaken about who someone was.

132
00:08:48,954 --> 00:08:50,940
Speaker 0: And the only way you're in the book.

133
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:57,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only way I was able to avoid that was that after the first like ten chapters, every time I finished a chapter, I would stop.

134
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:09,140
Speaker 1: And the next day, I would read a summary of that chapter, like from an external source, like a cliff note type thing, just to see if that lined up with what I got out of the chapter.

135
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:15,473
Speaker 1: And usually it was really spot on, but every now and then something, like I just missed something completely.

136
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,520
Speaker 1: Like something stupid obvious in retrospect.

137
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:27,080
Speaker 1: And it's partly just an artifact of the writing style and the language and partly the translation, but I think I was thinking about a lot.

138
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,423
Speaker 1: I was mentioning this to Scott before we started the show.

139
00:09:30,105 --> 00:09:37,540
Speaker 1: We recently read The Odyssey, which had a very modern, fantastic translation by Emily Wilson.

140
00:09:39,602 --> 00:09:47,340
Speaker 1: So the interesting thing about that translation was that it took the text and modernized it that made it easier to consume, understand, and enjoy to a modern audience.

141
00:09:48,161 --> 00:10:00,340
Speaker 1: The Tale of Genji would be harder to do because the things that are missing from the book, especially in the earlier chapters for me as a modern reader, those words are not there.

142
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,186
Speaker 1: They're only inferable from the text and from context.

143
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:11,880
Speaker 1: A translation that did what Emily Wilson did to The Odyssey would actually have to add a lot of context and words that are not there.

144
00:10:13,562 --> 00:10:18,920
Speaker 1: And I don't know if that still counts as a translation or if that gets into full on adaptation territory.

145
00:10:19,641 --> 00:10:22,633
Speaker 0: It would have to be like a Talmud situation.

146
00:10:22,653 --> 00:10:24,199
Speaker 0: I don't know if people know what the Talmud is.

147
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,022
Speaker 0: It's a Jewish book.

148
00:10:28,623 --> 00:10:30,085
Speaker 0: It's a Jewish set of books.

149
00:10:30,606 --> 00:10:41,260
Speaker 0: And basically if you ever open one up, it's like these huge red books and in the middle of each page will be a section of the Torah or the Old Testament.

150
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:41,721
Speaker 0: Right.

151
00:10:42,082 --> 00:10:51,740
Speaker 0: And all around the edges in the margins, there's these different sections and it's basically different comments from different rabbis throughout history.

152
00:10:52,221 --> 00:10:52,442
Speaker 0: Right.

153
00:10:52,904 --> 00:10:55,312
Speaker 0: Explaining what it means or what they thought about it.

154
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,818
Speaker 0: And they're like getting in the margins.

155
00:10:56,878 --> 00:10:57,360
Speaker 0: It's like all these.

156
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:10,020
Speaker 0: So the majority of the book is notes telling you that the real original text is in the middle and everything else is like, you know, so it's sort of like reading a newspaper article and putting the comments all around the sides.

157
00:11:11,081 --> 00:11:12,584
Speaker 0: From all the other people.

158
00:11:12,685 --> 00:11:18,980
Speaker 0: So I think if you want to make the tale of Genji more readable, right, you would do something like that.

159
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,644
Speaker 0: But then how long would it take you to read that fucking thing?

160
00:11:21,664 --> 00:11:22,506
Speaker 0: Right.

161
00:11:22,806 --> 00:11:30,500
Speaker 0: You would read a page and then you read all these comments from all these different scholars telling you what, you know, explaining what the heck that was.

162
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,144
Speaker 1: That's something I gave up on early on the first few chapters.

163
00:11:33,605 --> 00:11:35,988
Speaker 1: I would click on footnotes to like get the context.

164
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:43,100
Speaker 1: But there are so many footnotes that was so interruptive to my reading process that I just gave up on that.

165
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,120
Speaker 0: Yep.

166
00:11:45,624 --> 00:11:45,924
Speaker 0: All right.

167
00:11:45,964 --> 00:11:52,840
Speaker 0: So we're going to spend this episode from here on out talking about just the story, pretending that this was just like a book we just read.

168
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:54,502
Speaker 0: Just like any other book.

169
00:11:54,963 --> 00:11:59,408
Speaker 0: And then we'll do another episode where we talk about all kinds of meta stuff, history stuff.

170
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,232
Speaker 0: Stuff about the author.

171
00:12:02,632 --> 00:12:04,474
Speaker 0: Stuff I saw at the museum.

172
00:12:04,494 --> 00:12:06,176
Speaker 0: Stuff about novels as a form.

173
00:12:09,301 --> 00:12:09,481
Speaker 1: Yep.

174
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:14,133
Speaker 1: That one we'll probably either do the next Thursday episode or the following one, just because I'm going to brush up a little bit.

175
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:16,700
Speaker 1: Read some Wikipedias on Heian Era.

176
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,927
Speaker 0: I'm just going to talk about stuff that I know and not research additional things.

177
00:12:21,228 --> 00:12:22,391
Speaker 0: Because it's like, what's the point?

178
00:12:22,471 --> 00:12:26,680
Speaker 0: If someone out there wants to know those additional things, you can go research them on the internet yourself.

179
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,120
Speaker 1: I guess not just to regurgitate on the show.

180
00:12:31,122 --> 00:12:33,871
Speaker 0: There are people who are professional scholars about this.

181
00:12:33,931 --> 00:12:36,420
Speaker 0: If you really want to know, you can find them.

182
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:38,359
Speaker 0: I'm happy to tell you.

183
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:46,575
Speaker 1: The part I want to read about specifically is the debates over all the college years chapters of this book and who actually wrote them.

184
00:12:46,675 --> 00:12:49,580
Speaker 1: Because there's one chapter in particular.

185
00:12:49,821 --> 00:12:50,400
Speaker 0: I got the gist.

186
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:51,300
Speaker 1: Yep.

187
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,587
Speaker 1: But there's one chapter in particular where I clicked on a footnote.

188
00:12:55,968 --> 00:12:56,609
Speaker 1: Which one was it?

189
00:12:56,629 --> 00:13:00,475
Speaker 1: It was near the end of Genji's life.

190
00:13:00,755 --> 00:13:01,216
Speaker 1: He dies.

191
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:03,840
Speaker 1: And then I think it was the second or third chapter.

192
00:13:04,121 --> 00:13:12,720
Speaker 1: Whichever one it was, I just remember the footnote basically said that this chapter may be an ahistorical forgery for political reasons.

193
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,627
Speaker 1: Like, written later and inserted.

194
00:13:15,687 --> 00:13:18,740
Speaker 1: And there was a whole thing that I'm just curious about now.

195
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,708
Speaker 1: But yeah, we're going to treat this like it's just a book we read.

196
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,557
Speaker 1: And I don't regret reading this.

197
00:13:24,777 --> 00:13:25,319
Speaker 1: I enjoyed it.

198
00:13:27,021 --> 00:13:38,260
Speaker 1: The only thing that really stands out to me that's hard to reconcile is that on one hand, the last part of the book was easier to read and easier to understand.

199
00:13:38,961 --> 00:13:48,196
Speaker 1: But the story was both more compelling and less compelling in that it almost felt more like a modern novel.

200
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,740
Speaker 1: But the story felt a little more contrived.

201
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,508
Speaker 1: Like it was, "I'm going to figure out a way to make drama happen with a narrative on

202
00:13:55,608 --> 00:13:56,029
Speaker 1: purpose.".

203
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:01,098
Speaker 1: Whereas most of the tale of Genji up to that point was more like, "Here's a bunch of characters.

204
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:02,140
Speaker 1: What would

205
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:02,380
Speaker 1: happen?".

206
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:09,029
Speaker 1: It just sort of follows what would logically happen based on the story that was presented.

207
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:12,274
Speaker 1: And it kind of just flows and then just sort of peters out.

208
00:14:12,635 --> 00:14:16,460
Speaker 1: But the drama feels way more constructed after Genji dies.

209
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:28,940
Speaker 0: Well, I think, you know, the first, before Genji dies, the form of the novel is there is a narrator who is basically telling you, "Oh, this happened, then this happened, then this," right?

210
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:38,119
Speaker 0: And then the narrator breaks the fourth wall on a very few occasions and they say things like, "Oh, but yeah, I don't remember all of

211
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:38,340
Speaker 0: that.".

212
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,219
Speaker 1: Genji said heartfelt words that it would be improper to repeat to you here.

213
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,802
Speaker 0: Yeah, stuff like that, exactly.

214
00:14:47,705 --> 00:14:53,812
Speaker 0: But yeah, after Genji dies, I think, you know, it's still a third-person narrated book.

215
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:55,694
Speaker 0: So-and-so did this, so-and-so did that.

216
00:14:56,135 --> 00:15:00,220
Speaker 0: But I think the presence of that narrator is sort of gone.

217
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,742
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it's replaced by.

218
00:15:01,782 --> 00:15:07,413
Speaker 1: there's a lot more "he said, she said" paragraph explaining where the fuck someone is.

219
00:15:07,894 --> 00:15:08,855
Speaker 1: Like, where are we?

220
00:15:09,196 --> 00:15:11,400
Speaker 1: That was not in the first part of the book, really.

221
00:15:11,784 --> 00:15:11,986
Speaker 0: Yep.

222
00:15:12,773 --> 00:15:13,440
Speaker 0: It's very different.

223
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:22,960
Speaker 1: Like, way early on when a ghost shows up and murders someone Genji's having sex with, which, like, that happens way early and it's not the first ghost murder.

224
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:28,110
Speaker 1: But it surprised me that I had to back up and reread that section again.

225
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,996
Speaker 1: One, to figure out, no, literal ghosts is what they're talking about.

226
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:33,060
Speaker 1: And two, wait, where are they?

227
00:15:33,401 --> 00:15:37,048
Speaker 1: They went to some abandoned house, like, just somewhere.

228
00:15:37,108 --> 00:15:39,713
Speaker 1: Like, they just fucking snuck away to an abandoned house.

229
00:15:40,214 --> 00:15:41,837
Speaker 1: And it was not clear.

230
00:15:41,877 --> 00:15:43,580
Speaker 1: I did not get that in my first reading.

231
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,845
Speaker 0: Alright, so basic plot summary, right?

232
00:15:46,885 --> 00:15:53,740
Speaker 0: Because, despite being fucking long, obviously, not that much happens in these books.

233
00:15:54,335 --> 00:15:54,520
Speaker 1: Yeah.

234
00:15:55,341 --> 00:16:01,230
Speaker 0: You could list the things that happened and just very quickly, right?

235
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:05,095
Speaker 0: So, it's really separated into three sections, if you think about it.

236
00:16:05,135 --> 00:16:08,200
Speaker 0: And the first section is like young Genji, right?

237
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,860
Speaker 0: Where he's, you know, rim, rim, he's like, oh, yeah, he's coasting through life or whatever, right?

238
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,560
Speaker 1: Sleepwalking through life, no real responsibilities.

239
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:24,071
Speaker 0: He's a teenager of great privilege and talent and skill and beauty and he's taking advantage of it.

240
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:32,180
Speaker 0: and he's horny and he's, you know, his dad's the emperor, so he's just, you know, doing his thing, right?

241
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,248
Speaker 1: It's almost even better because his dad's the emperor, but he's not the heir.

242
00:16:36,268 --> 00:16:41,180
Speaker 1: So, he's almost like, has all the wealth of the emperor's son, but none of the responsibilities.

243
00:16:41,921 --> 00:16:59,360
Speaker 0: Right, so then, the second part is like, okay, Genji's sort of an adult now, so he's not the emperor, but he does have a lot of responsibilities, even though the book never talks about those responsibilities, but he's like, you know, a chancellor or a counselor or all kinds of different government positions.

244
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:16,599
Speaker 1: But you see, he's also, that's the point where he's, the story, like, it's almost like he fucked around and he starts to find out, like, that's where suddenly, one, there's a bunch of times where consequences happen, which wasn't happening in the earlier parts of the books, or two, something he did before.

245
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:20,400
Speaker 0: He's much more restricted because he can't get away with stuff that he got away with when he was a kid.

246
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:22,359
Speaker 1: Stuff he did before it catches up with him.

247
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,440
Speaker 0: He also cares about things more than he did before, you know.

248
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:36,020
Speaker 1: I remember there was one chapter then, right before he goes on exile, where he's just like, The exile is sort of the transition point.

249
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:44,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, for a bunch of things, but like, he's about, he could just run away, like, he's about to get caught fucking around, and he's like, I'm gonna rock and run away.

250
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,908
Speaker 1: And then he's like, you know what, no, that actually isn't gonna work out.

251
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,833
Speaker 1: I gotta be an adult here.

252
00:17:49,853 --> 00:17:50,956
Speaker 1: I can't just run away.

253
00:17:51,357 --> 00:17:52,380
Speaker 1: They're gonna catch me anyway.

254
00:17:53,002 --> 00:17:53,965
Speaker 1: I've gotta deal with this.

255
00:17:54,065 --> 00:17:58,760
Speaker 1: It was a significant transition that happened over the course of one paragraph.

256
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,180
Speaker 1: And then he goes on exile pretty soon after.

257
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:10,640
Speaker 0: So that second part, where Genji's an adult, it really slows down and zooms in to this status quo scenario where Genji lives in this house, right?

258
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:17,540
Speaker 0: With his ladies and all his staff and servants and all these goings on at his house.

259
00:18:18,502 --> 00:18:27,040
Speaker 0: And the court drama, since he's now such a significant person, and also the drama of the people that are close to him and related to him.

260
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,217
Speaker 1: But the part that I thought most interesting about that part of the book was that...

261
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,240
Speaker 0: I think that's the significant famous part of the book.

262
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,437
Speaker 1: It's the most interesting by far, because the court drama...

263
00:18:41,401 --> 00:18:51,880
Speaker 0: Even if something was the first novel technically, it wouldn't have been such a significant, studied, historic thing if there wasn't any sort of merit to it.

264
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,620
Speaker 0: I think most of the merit of the story is in that middle section.

265
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:00,780
Speaker 1: Absolutely, because what I like is that in the first part, there's no real undercurrent.

266
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,700
Speaker 1: It's just, yeah, there's political drama, but Genji's so beautiful, it doesn't matter.

267
00:19:04,881 --> 00:19:06,165
Speaker 1: He's a child, who cares?

268
00:19:06,727 --> 00:19:10,660
Speaker 1: But he's just hanging out with his friend, the captain, and everything's great.

269
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:19,660
Speaker 1: But in the second part, especially when the court turns against him, and there's a lot of background chatter about these evil times.

270
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:26,660
Speaker 1: And it's interesting because the book doesn't actually explain specifically what is happening in the court.

271
00:19:27,322 --> 00:19:34,740
Speaker 1: It just shows that the displeasure of individuals that are part of that has cast him out of polite society for a while.

272
00:19:35,802 --> 00:19:41,480
Speaker 1: But it's definitely implied that there is danger there, that the government is not stable, that the times are changing.

273
00:19:42,663 --> 00:19:46,117
Speaker 1: There's an undercurrent that Genji's job actually did matter at that point.

274
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:46,760
Speaker 1: A lot.

275
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,680
Speaker 1: And everyone's jobs mattered a lot because there's political upheaval.

276
00:19:52,262 --> 00:20:01,500
Speaker 0: Well, you can also see that political upheaval is reflected in the story in the forms of what activities all these nobles are partaking in.

277
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:07,880
Speaker 0: So before the darker times, they're all having parties and festivals.

278
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:11,040
Speaker 1: A lot of music, a lot of poetry contests.

279
00:20:12,904 --> 00:20:19,420
Speaker 0: And then later in the story, they keep talking about how no one plays the music like they did before.

280
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:31,520
Speaker 0: It's just the level of festivity and luxury that's happening significantly decreases over time amongst the noble family.

281
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:48,900
Speaker 1: That's the other thing I want to read about because I wonder if in Heian era Japan, there was an era of conservatism and asceticism that set in in the government that this book was mirroring while also having Genji's fortune sort of follow that same path.

282
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:49,441
Speaker 0: Right.

283
00:20:49,761 --> 00:21:07,380
Speaker 0: Well, I think also part of it is that if you didn't already know this, you can tell from the book that women, especially noble women in that era, were very cloistered, secluded, treated as objects as a very patriarchal, misogynist society.

284
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:12,648
Speaker 1: Like literally, Genji doesn't even see the face of half the people he has sex with.

285
00:21:13,028 --> 00:21:20,660
Speaker 1: One of the chapters is literally he's trying to figure out which daughter of this guy he actually slept with the previous night because he's not sure.

286
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:29,938
Speaker 0: But this book is written by a woman of that time who was like, you know, the daughter of like some like governor or something.

287
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:30,600
Speaker 0: Right.

288
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:34,686
Speaker 0: I think that's what the name Murasaki Shikibu.

289
00:21:34,746 --> 00:21:45,120
Speaker 0: I think what they said that it means is like Murasaki, that's the name of like a flower and it's the name of one of the characters in the book that sort of like her, you know, self insert.

290
00:21:45,561 --> 00:21:45,801
Speaker 0: Right.

291
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:54,555
Speaker 0: And then Shikibu means like like like like masks, like ceremonial something.

292
00:21:55,095 --> 00:21:55,336
Speaker 0: Right.

293
00:21:55,396 --> 00:21:57,339
Speaker 0: And it's like that's like her dad's job.

294
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,080
Speaker 0: Right.

295
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,844
Speaker 0: That's that they don't know the real name of this person.

296
00:22:01,864 --> 00:22:02,645
Speaker 0: Right.

297
00:22:02,685 --> 00:22:13,220
Speaker 0: Much like we don't know the names of a lot of the characters because he wasn't polite to refer to people by their actual name at the time, which honestly gave me the most struggle reading this book.

298
00:22:13,861 --> 00:22:14,101
Speaker 0: Right.

299
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:15,463
Speaker 0: But this author.

300
00:22:15,823 --> 00:22:16,084
Speaker 0: Right.

301
00:22:16,384 --> 00:22:21,711
Speaker 0: You know, was similarly much like the characters was similarly sequestered.

302
00:22:21,731 --> 00:22:22,512
Speaker 0: Right.

303
00:22:22,752 --> 00:22:23,573
Speaker 0: In society.

304
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:23,774
Speaker 0: Right.

305
00:22:23,834 --> 00:22:24,795
Speaker 0: Hidden from view.

306
00:22:25,376 --> 00:22:25,696
Speaker 0: Right.

307
00:22:25,936 --> 00:22:26,337
Speaker 0: Not a lot.

308
00:22:26,377 --> 00:22:28,540
Speaker 0: Not just walking about town, seeing what's going on.

309
00:22:28,921 --> 00:22:35,154
Speaker 0: So I think, you know, my guess would be why didn't they write about like what's going on in the government?

310
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:37,680
Speaker 0: And because because the person writing didn't know.

311
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,281
Speaker 1: What?

312
00:22:38,321 --> 00:22:43,933
Speaker 1: Yeah, they either didn't know what they knew, but it could also know about goings on in up in the palace.

313
00:22:43,973 --> 00:22:46,077
Speaker 0: That's that's the things they wrote about were things they knew.

314
00:22:46,137 --> 00:22:47,280
Speaker 0: They didn't write about anything else.

315
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:47,500
Speaker 0: Yep.

316
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:59,860
Speaker 1: Though two two things that stand out to me around that are the other thing that could be going on is the depending on the time the author may have avoided the topics that could have gotten them in trouble.

317
00:23:01,661 --> 00:23:02,442
Speaker 1: That could have happened.

318
00:23:02,763 --> 00:23:12,120
Speaker 1: But to true, I'm curious about why some of those things were left out, because there are a few points where there is dialog from commoners.

319
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:16,069
Speaker 1: It happens once early on, but it happens a couple times later, like pretty rare.

320
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:16,731
Speaker 0: But it's in there.

321
00:23:16,831 --> 00:23:20,380
Speaker 1: It happens a little bit when Genji's in exile because he's like not in the court town.

322
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:20,640
Speaker 1: Like he's.

323
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,743
Speaker 1: basically it's funny.

324
00:23:21,783 --> 00:23:25,030
Speaker 1: He's like, I'm in the fucking booties in the middle of nowhere.

325
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:29,280
Speaker 1: It's like I got forced to forced to move to like upstate New York and this shit sucks.

326
00:23:29,722 --> 00:23:32,352
Speaker 1: But then you look at the map at the end of this goddamn book.

327
00:23:32,914 --> 00:23:33,979
Speaker 1: He didn't go that far.

328
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:36,985
Speaker 0: It's like it's not like you had cars.

329
00:23:37,306 --> 00:23:37,567
Speaker 0: Yep.

330
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:41,480
Speaker 0: You know, someone pulled him in like a wagon or carried him and, you know.

331
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,380
Speaker 1: Yep.

332
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:43,623
Speaker 0: But you can't go that far.

333
00:23:43,763 --> 00:23:47,070
Speaker 1: There's a few points along the way where you get dialog from regular ass people.

334
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:52,140
Speaker 1: And every time that occurs, those characters talk like normal human beings.

335
00:23:52,381 --> 00:23:56,110
Speaker 1: And that really doesn't happen at any other point until the college years.

336
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,960
Speaker 1: Part of this book where there's a lot more like structured dialog than there was in the beginning.

337
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:05,373
Speaker 0: And I could have just been, you know, I don't know if that's an artifact of the original text or the translators did that.

338
00:24:05,674 --> 00:24:05,975
Speaker 0: Yeah.

339
00:24:06,235 --> 00:24:06,656
Speaker 0: On purpose.

340
00:24:06,676 --> 00:24:08,040
Speaker 1: That's what that's one of the things I don't know.

341
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:14,251
Speaker 0: So second part of the book, right, is the court drama of, you know, Genji and all his people.

342
00:24:14,311 --> 00:24:17,216
Speaker 0: They live in, you know, in the in the city next to the palace.

343
00:24:17,737 --> 00:24:18,799
Speaker 0: How things go on.

344
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:19,460
Speaker 0: Right.

345
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,884
Speaker 0: And Genji finally dies.

346
00:24:22,245 --> 00:24:22,545
Speaker 0: Right.

347
00:24:22,585 --> 00:24:25,170
Speaker 0: Because you don't live that long in that era.

348
00:24:27,053 --> 00:24:28,295
Speaker 1: Like they don't make it that far.

349
00:24:29,257 --> 00:24:29,498
Speaker 0: Yeah.

350
00:24:29,578 --> 00:24:30,800
Speaker 0: No one no one lives that long.

351
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,323
Speaker 0: They're like, oh, man, I'm 50.

352
00:24:32,323 --> 00:24:34,787
Speaker 0: I'm really it's almost more than like 40.

353
00:24:34,787 --> 00:24:36,590
Speaker 0: Like they're considered like old retire.

354
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:42,420
Speaker 1: I mean, look, his half brother, the guy who was emperor briefly, he has to abdicate because he's dying.

355
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,662
Speaker 1: Like he's sick.

356
00:24:44,323 --> 00:24:46,247
Speaker 1: Well, Genji is still actually doing pretty well.

357
00:24:46,287 --> 00:24:49,534
Speaker 1: Like we get to get another emperor while Genji is still just fine.

358
00:24:50,216 --> 00:24:50,356
Speaker 0: Yeah.

359
00:24:50,376 --> 00:24:51,679
Speaker 0: The guy goes up to the mountains.

360
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:52,060
Speaker 1: Yeah.

361
00:24:54,003 --> 00:24:54,363
Speaker 0: But yeah.

362
00:24:54,403 --> 00:24:59,030
Speaker 0: So then after Genji dies, the focus shifts to these other two characters.

363
00:24:59,090 --> 00:24:59,270
Speaker 0: Right.

364
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:00,452
Speaker 0: It's his grandson.

365
00:25:01,193 --> 00:25:05,740
Speaker 0: Well, Kaoru is not his grandson.

366
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,023
Speaker 0: Well, Kaoru is basically.

367
00:25:09,063 --> 00:25:11,785
Speaker 1: Let me pull up that chart of the characters again.

368
00:25:12,065 --> 00:25:12,306
Speaker 0: Right.

369
00:25:12,766 --> 00:25:16,449
Speaker 0: Kaoru is, I guess, legally Genji's son.

370
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:17,230
Speaker 0: Right.

371
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:28,660
Speaker 0: But what actually happened was Genji's the wife of one of the wives of Genji that was Kaoru's mother actually got it on with, you know, the intended.

372
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,160
Speaker 0: Right.

373
00:25:30,301 --> 00:25:36,346
Speaker 1: No, I love this because in the first part of the book, this is like a major part of the story, the Kashiwagi thing.

374
00:25:36,366 --> 00:25:38,468
Speaker 0: It's like it takes like two chapters.

375
00:25:38,548 --> 00:25:43,712
Speaker 0: It's like the biggest chapter in the book is like all about this this one drama.

376
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:51,879
Speaker 1: It's like what I love about that drama is how much it parallels the very beginning of the tale of Genji with the.

377
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,345
Speaker 1: There's the relationship that was expected, the relationship that wasn't expected.

378
00:25:57,385 --> 00:25:58,206
Speaker 1: Genji gets bored, whatever.

379
00:25:58,266 --> 00:26:04,936
Speaker 1: But then you get the point where Genji is sleeping with the wrong person and the emperor's son is actually Genji's son.

380
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:08,180
Speaker 1: And now the same thing sort of happens to Genji.

381
00:26:09,961 --> 00:26:10,141
Speaker 0: Yeah.

382
00:26:10,161 --> 00:26:19,434
Speaker 0: So anyway, but yeah, so Kaoru, who is, I guess, legally Genji's son, but, you know, probably Kashiwagi, almost definitely Kashiwagi's biological son.

383
00:26:20,015 --> 00:26:21,517
Speaker 0: And then there's this other guy.

384
00:26:21,537 --> 00:26:23,160
Speaker 0: I forget his name.

385
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,059
Speaker 1: Oh, Kuimo Nakahara, the friend guy.

386
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,181
Speaker 0: Yeah, the friend guy.

387
00:26:28,221 --> 00:26:32,164
Speaker 0: But basically it's like, you know, here you see a lot of tropes.

388
00:26:32,264 --> 00:26:33,245
Speaker 0: Yeah.

389
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:39,550
Speaker 0: You see in this story, you got these two guys and there's a lot of tropes that I think have carried to the present day.

390
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:39,830
Speaker 0: Right.

391
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:51,680
Speaker 0: You've got the one dude who's like, you know, buff and, you know, sexy and, you know, naughty, you know, get, you know, just like raping people and whatnot.

392
00:26:52,240 --> 00:27:02,007
Speaker 0: And then you got, you know, Kaoru who's like, you know, he's very, you know, religious and, you know, reserved.

393
00:27:02,608 --> 00:27:03,729
Speaker 0: Right.

394
00:27:03,749 --> 00:27:04,810
Speaker 0: And, you know, uptight.

395
00:27:06,931 --> 00:27:09,233
Speaker 0: And you got the parallel between these two dudes.

396
00:27:09,813 --> 00:27:18,560
Speaker 0: and they basically fight over the daughters of this dude who lives in the mountains or lives, you know, in a village.

397
00:27:19,042 --> 00:27:23,180
Speaker 0: And they just fight over his daughters for like several chapters and then the ends, abruptly the end.

398
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,621
Speaker 1: And it escalates.

399
00:27:24,801 --> 00:27:36,634
Speaker 1: The thing is, unlike all the stuff that happens in the first part of the book, that conflict escalates rapidly to a faked death, an attempted suicide, and they lose, like they both lose in the end.

400
00:27:36,774 --> 00:27:42,320
Speaker 1: Like it's a radically different ending from how those dramas ended in the first part.

401
00:27:42,901 --> 00:27:43,101
Speaker 0: Right.

402
00:27:43,181 --> 00:27:50,448
Speaker 0: It's like, but on the one hand, it does keep escalating, but also the fundamental drama doesn't change.

403
00:27:50,528 --> 00:27:53,531
Speaker 0: It's like they're still fighting over these two, these ladies.

404
00:27:53,711 --> 00:27:55,073
Speaker 0: They're still fighting over these ladies.

405
00:27:55,393 --> 00:27:59,237
Speaker 0: Okay, things, something happened, but these two dudes are still fighting over these ladies.

406
00:28:00,538 --> 00:28:02,060
Speaker 0: It's like, it just stays that way.

407
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:06,365
Speaker 1: But I like how in the end, she's basically like the one girl is just like, fuck it.

408
00:28:06,406 --> 00:28:08,488
Speaker 1: I'm going to be a nun and fuck both y'all.

409
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:10,091
Speaker 1: Like, I'm not even going to respond to your letters.

410
00:28:10,111 --> 00:28:17,000
Speaker 0: A lot of people throughout the entire book go off to become nuns or monks when they're done with noble biz.

411
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,442
Speaker 1: I mean, Genji kind of does that.

412
00:28:18,462 --> 00:28:23,013
Speaker 0: But I assume that's something you can do as a luxury of being noble.

413
00:28:23,094 --> 00:28:25,319
Speaker 0: is that you can afford to just go into the, you know.

414
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:26,681
Speaker 1: Yeah.

415
00:28:26,701 --> 00:28:28,223
Speaker 1: Well, that's the CEO in Roman history.

416
00:28:28,263 --> 00:28:30,367
Speaker 1: Like there's the same thing of fuck the Roman empire.

417
00:28:30,387 --> 00:28:31,088
Speaker 1: I retired.

418
00:28:31,108 --> 00:28:32,230
Speaker 1: I'm going to take care of my turnips.

419
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,472
Speaker 1: This is your problem now.

420
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:35,595
Speaker 0: Like I'm not going to go be a hermit.

421
00:28:36,537 --> 00:28:38,320
Speaker 1: I can appreciate that desire.

422
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:40,962
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

423
00:28:40,982 --> 00:28:46,306
Speaker 0: So we'll zoom in a little bit more in part one, right?

424
00:28:46,426 --> 00:28:53,212
Speaker 0: So part one, you got Genji and his mom is like a concert of the emperor, right?

425
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:55,114
Speaker 0: The Kiritsubo concert, right?

426
00:28:55,974 --> 00:29:00,358
Speaker 0: Uh, but, uh, and like the emperor like totally thinks she's awesome.

427
00:29:00,878 --> 00:29:01,099
Speaker 0: Right.

428
00:29:01,179 --> 00:29:02,600
Speaker 0: And thinks Genji is awesome too.

429
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:02,900
Speaker 0: Yeah.

430
00:29:03,361 --> 00:29:09,809
Speaker 0: But technically this other concert of the emperor, the Koki Den concert, right?

431
00:29:10,269 --> 00:29:12,392
Speaker 0: Is like the more important one.

432
00:29:12,412 --> 00:29:13,233
Speaker 0: Yeah.

433
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:19,440
Speaker 0: So the Koki Den concert's son, Suzaku is going to be the next emperor, not Genji.

434
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:19,781
Speaker 0: Yeah.

435
00:29:19,881 --> 00:29:21,043
Speaker 1: And Suzaku is okay.

436
00:29:21,063 --> 00:29:29,160
Speaker 1: Like he's not a bad person, but, uh, that drama kind of drives everything that happens to Genji in the second part like that.

437
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,021
Speaker 0: So, right.

438
00:29:30,281 --> 00:29:35,247
Speaker 0: So since Genji is not the heir, he goes around, you know, doing all sorts of shenanigans.

439
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:46,180
Speaker 0: But meanwhile, Genji is the most beautiful, the most perfect, the most talented, the most beloved, the perfect, you know, like everything person, right?

440
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:51,288
Speaker 0: It's like when he dances at the festival or sings or poetries or anything, he's like the best.

441
00:29:51,608 --> 00:29:54,973
Speaker 0: It's like, this guy's the best at everything, right?

442
00:29:55,414 --> 00:29:59,520
Speaker 0: You know, just the perfect dude, except for all the bad things he does.

443
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:00,962
Speaker 0: Right.

444
00:30:01,765 --> 00:30:05,520
Speaker 0: So Genji goes around sleeping with all kinds of ladies.

445
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:06,600
Speaker 1: Yeah.

446
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:12,172
Speaker 1: And it's, it's interesting how some of them are super dramatic, like the ghost murder.

447
00:30:12,552 --> 00:30:16,380
Speaker 1: Some of them are just absolute shit shows that are just hilarious.

448
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:27,954
Speaker 1: There's a big mix of what happens, but it's interesting in terms of his taste because he doesn't seem to care that much who he actually has sex with for most of the first part, because the only

449
00:30:27,994 --> 00:30:28,334
Speaker 0: person he

450
00:30:28,554 --> 00:30:32,660
Speaker 1: actually wants to have sex with all the time is the woman who reminds him of his own mom.

451
00:30:33,523 --> 00:30:33,644
Speaker 0: Right.

452
00:30:33,664 --> 00:30:37,220
Speaker 0: Well, I think all of it is having to do with his mother issues.

453
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:42,689
Speaker 1: His mother issues are such a big part of Genji's life.

454
00:30:42,889 --> 00:30:48,580
Speaker 1: It is sad and funny and it stands out a lot to a moderate audience.

455
00:30:49,421 --> 00:30:49,702
Speaker 0: Right.

456
00:30:49,822 --> 00:30:53,489
Speaker 0: So one of the emperor's other consorts, right?

457
00:30:53,549 --> 00:31:00,100
Speaker 0: Wives is Fujitsubo, who is extremely significant in the book, right?

458
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:17,980
Speaker 0: And that's like, so Genji gets with her and she has a baby and that baby is actually the third emperor, Reizei, who everyone, basically, you know, it's a very small number of characters who know that that is not the emperor's son.

459
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:23,628
Speaker 1: The funniest scene in the whole goddamn book is they think they got away with it.

460
00:31:23,688 --> 00:31:31,098
Speaker 1: And then like a few chapters later, like the kids a little older and the emperor Reizei is just like, hey, uh, or is that?

461
00:31:31,138 --> 00:31:32,260
Speaker 1: no, uh, Susan.

462
00:31:32,721 --> 00:31:33,799
Speaker 1: God, I forget their fucking name.

463
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:40,140
Speaker 0: Well, because the reason that, you know, the hint that gives it away to the cat, like, you know, because you're reading the book as the reader.

464
00:31:40,701 --> 00:31:42,460
Speaker 1: Well, the hint is he looks exactly like Genji.

465
00:31:42,981 --> 00:31:43,183
Speaker 0: Right.

466
00:31:43,223 --> 00:31:45,079
Speaker 0: It's like he's way hot, just like Genji.

467
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:52,380
Speaker 1: But the emperor invites Genji over and they're like hanging out and Genji shows up and he sees the kid for the first time in like a little while.

468
00:31:52,921 --> 00:31:53,579
Speaker 0: And it looks like him.

469
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:53,880
Speaker 0: Yeah.

470
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,322
Speaker 1: He's just like, fuck shit.

471
00:31:55,964 --> 00:31:56,665
Speaker 1: How do they not know?

472
00:31:56,845 --> 00:31:57,666
Speaker 1: They're going to find out.

473
00:31:57,947 --> 00:31:59,990
Speaker 1: And the emperor is very, very like.

474
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:06,340
Speaker 1: there's a whole scene where the emperor is like talking to Genji and the whole time Genji's quietly panicking that he's about to be executed.

475
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:07,521
Speaker 0: Yep.

476
00:32:08,223 --> 00:32:08,523
Speaker 0: But yes.

477
00:32:08,724 --> 00:32:11,751
Speaker 0: But I mean, after getting with Fujitsubo, right.

478
00:32:12,452 --> 00:32:14,196
Speaker 0: You know, Genji, like, you know, is like.

479
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:15,720
Speaker 0: that's like his number one.

480
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:21,900
Speaker 1: He's like he's obsessed with her to the point that even she is like, dude, like, you've got to calm down, kid.

481
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:28,720
Speaker 0: But he can't like, you know, their relationship from then on out is very, you know, distant.

482
00:32:28,861 --> 00:32:28,981
Speaker 0: Right.

483
00:32:29,021 --> 00:32:33,140
Speaker 0: It's like Genji keeps trying to like, you know, like, you know, talk to her more.

484
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:39,599
Speaker 0: It's like he just, you know, because of the way the society is and whatnot, he just, you know, he sort of forced away from her.

485
00:32:40,184 --> 00:32:41,460
Speaker 0: She becomes a nun at one point.

486
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,960
Speaker 1: It's interesting because she is not stupid and she is like, Genji.

487
00:32:46,281 --> 00:32:46,883
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure.

488
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:49,111
Speaker 1: We could like I wouldn't mind.

489
00:32:49,433 --> 00:32:51,320
Speaker 1: But you realize how much shit we're in.

490
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,288
Speaker 1: Like this is a dangerous situation.

491
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:56,000
Speaker 1: You've got to just like not bother me for a little while.

492
00:32:56,283 --> 00:32:57,618
Speaker 1: And he is incapable of this.

493
00:32:58,402 --> 00:32:58,623
Speaker 0: Right.

494
00:32:58,683 --> 00:33:02,779
Speaker 0: So that's that's the first most important, I guess, person that Genji is getting with.

495
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:03,000
Speaker 0: Right.

496
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:10,720
Speaker 0: The I guess it's worth mentioning, Genji has this legal wife, Aoi, who only shows up like two and a half times.

497
00:33:11,261 --> 00:33:16,400
Speaker 0: And she dies very young, which Genji, I guess, you know, doesn't really like her or care about her.

498
00:33:16,581 --> 00:33:18,199
Speaker 0: And that's sort of convenient for Genji.

499
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:28,219
Speaker 1: There's a whole chapter that really paints her as being extremely angry and difficult, which take with a grain of salt because Genji was ignoring her.

500
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,780
Speaker 1: Her whole of all her fortunes were ruined by being married to Genji.

501
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:40,700
Speaker 1: The whole like left of the palace is angry at the fact that she was basically forced into a marriage with Genji instead of the real crown prince.

502
00:33:41,481 --> 00:33:44,380
Speaker 1: So like there's a lot of drama that comes out of that relationship.

503
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,140
Speaker 1: But basically the only time she appears is what?

504
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:53,800
Speaker 1: She forces the other woman out of the way with her carriage and causes a bunch of drama that Genji has to go apologize for.

505
00:33:54,063 --> 00:33:55,719
Speaker 1: And then she has Genji's kid and dies.

506
00:33:57,809 --> 00:33:58,113
Speaker 0: Yep.

507
00:33:58,133 --> 00:33:58,538
Speaker 0: So then...

508
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,579
Speaker 1: And then Genji ignores the kid for like a year.

509
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:01,900
Speaker 0: Right.

510
00:34:03,021 --> 00:34:03,261
Speaker 0: All right.

511
00:34:03,281 --> 00:34:11,360
Speaker 0: So now you've got, I guess, the second most important character, right, which is where the author's name comes from, who's Murasaki.

512
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,760
Speaker 0: So Murasaki, and this is where Genji the creep enters the scene.

513
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:20,699
Speaker 1: Well, Genji the hebophile creep as opposed to just Genji the creep.

514
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,440
Speaker 0: It's borderline there.

515
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,260
Speaker 1: It's pedophile at this point.

516
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,500
Speaker 1: The only saving grace is Genji does not appear to actually do anything until she's a little older.

517
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:33,647
Speaker 0: But... But anyway...

518
00:34:34,226 --> 00:34:34,311
Speaker 1: Yeah.

519
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,938
Speaker 1: I guess to her credit, when he finally does, she is like, "What the fuck,

520
00:34:39,998 --> 00:34:40,379
Speaker 1: dad?".

521
00:34:41,309 --> 00:34:41,559
Speaker 1: Yeah.

522
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:45,695
Speaker 1: There's a whole chapter where she is like, "Uh, this is not what I signed up for.

523
00:34:45,715 --> 00:34:45,775
Speaker 1: WTF.".

524
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:47,541
Speaker 0: Yep.

525
00:34:47,562 --> 00:34:52,458
Speaker 0: So anyway, Genji finds this girl, Murasaki, somewhere, right?

526
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,774
Speaker 0: And he's like, "Holy

527
00:34:53,815 --> 00:34:54,079
Speaker 0: shit.".

528
00:34:54,241 --> 00:34:56,659
Speaker 0: And I guess, you know, the girl reminds him of his mom, right?

529
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,720
Speaker 1: This is where it's both kinds of creepy.

530
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:05,040
Speaker 1: He's like, "Well, I want to continue to have sex with my pseudo mom, but I can't because I'll get in trouble.

531
00:35:05,521 --> 00:35:08,576
Speaker 1: So I have found a girl who I can groom to be just like

532
00:35:08,636 --> 00:35:08,777
Speaker 1: her.".

533
00:35:09,702 --> 00:35:09,903
Speaker 0: Yeah.

534
00:35:09,923 --> 00:35:13,140
Speaker 0: He finds this like very young girl, extremely young, Murasaki.

535
00:35:13,341 --> 00:35:23,974
Speaker 0: And he basically keeps trying to pressure and convince, right, the girl's guardians to like, you know, "Listen, I'm basically, the emperor is my dad, right?

536
00:35:24,014 --> 00:35:25,560
Speaker 0: I'm a super rich, noble dude.

537
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,890
Speaker 0: You know, let me have this girl.

538
00:35:28,212 --> 00:35:29,700
Speaker 0: I'll raise her as my daughter.

539
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:32,295
Speaker 0: I swear to you that my intentions are pure,

540
00:35:32,315 --> 00:35:32,436
Speaker 0: right?".

541
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:39,099
Speaker 1: And to their credit, they are basically like, "Lol, there is no way we're giving this girl to

542
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:39,219
Speaker 1: you.".

543
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,918
Speaker 0: Even in the year 1000, they're like, "What the fuck is wrong with

544
00:35:41,959 --> 00:35:42,100
Speaker 0: you?".

545
00:35:42,321 --> 00:35:52,719
Speaker 1: One of the lines I mentioned, I think, when we were doing a meta moment like a year ago, because this is still really early in the book, but it was something like, "This Genji certainly has modern

546
00:35:52,779 --> 00:35:53,100
Speaker 1: tastes.".

547
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,880
Speaker 1: Like, I guess this is what nobles are like today.

548
00:35:56,201 --> 00:36:03,278
Speaker 1: It's a conversation, I want to say, between like the woman who's her guardian and that guy who's there, like the two people who are sort of taking care of her.

549
00:36:04,742 --> 00:36:06,739
Speaker 1: It's like just a side conversation that happens.

550
00:36:07,242 --> 00:36:15,560
Speaker 1: But he just fucking kidnaps her, and hides her at his house, and ploys her with toys, and it is 100% creepy groomer, like the whole time.

551
00:36:16,081 --> 00:36:20,280
Speaker 0: He grooms Murasaki basically through her entire childhood.

552
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:34,840
Speaker 1: To be exactly like his mom, or his mom fetish, and to like get, like he tricks her into sitting on his lap, like even through the translation, and the history, and thousand years of humanity.

553
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,276
Speaker 1: You read this today and you're like, "Yeah, it is as creepy as it feels like it

554
00:36:38,376 --> 00:36:38,456
Speaker 1: is.".

555
00:36:39,341 --> 00:36:41,111
Speaker 0: Yup, it is creepy AF.

556
00:36:41,654 --> 00:36:42,660
Speaker 0: Genji is no good.

557
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,045
Speaker 1: But what the fuck Genji?

558
00:36:44,246 --> 00:36:49,755
Speaker 1: He finally like convinces her to marry him, despite the fact that it's a bunny drop, or even she is like,

559
00:36:49,835 --> 00:36:50,016
Speaker 1: "No.".

560
00:36:50,821 --> 00:36:51,819
Speaker 1: And then he immediately cheats on her.

561
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,752
Speaker 0: Oh my god, it is bunny drop, isn't it?

562
00:36:53,792 --> 00:36:55,060
Speaker 0: Only it's a forced bunny drop.

563
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,805
Speaker 0: The bunny drop guy, right?

564
00:36:57,628 --> 00:37:01,420
Speaker 0: It landed on him, whereas Genji went out and tried to get it on purpose.

565
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,959
Speaker 1: Yep, Genji bunny dropped on purpose.

566
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,820
Speaker 0: It's even worse than bunny drop, somehow.

567
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,786
Speaker 0: But the worst thing, the thing

568
00:37:06,827 --> 00:37:23,920
Speaker 1: that actually like made me really not like Genji, because up to this point, not like Genji was funny, even if he's kind of a bad person, but as soon as he actually marries her and it's real, he immediately cheats on her, and actually just kind of ignores her for a long time.

569
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,260
Speaker 1: Like he doesn't give a shit about her anymore.

570
00:37:26,261 --> 00:37:29,698
Speaker 0: Yep, so he's got, you know, he grooms this girl.

571
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,386
Speaker 0: Right, well, okay, so hold on.

572
00:37:32,406 --> 00:37:34,560
Speaker 0: So he got, Murasaki is so important, right?

573
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,639
Speaker 0: It's like basically the focus of most of the book, right?

574
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:45,311
Speaker 0: So he grooms this girl all through her childhood, but then when you get to the second part of the book, she's basically like the perfect heroine.

575
00:37:45,351 --> 00:37:57,040
Speaker 0: Like Genji did such a good job grooming her, that she became the most amazing woman that everyone loves, who is perfect and smart and wonderful and is the greatest.

576
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,780
Speaker 0: And, you know, everything about her is amazing.

577
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,900
Speaker 0: And that's why she's sort of like the author self-insert deal.

578
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:09,680
Speaker 1: Yep, she is like literally perfect in every possible way.

579
00:38:09,981 --> 00:38:10,540
Speaker 1: And it is telling.

580
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,875
Speaker 0: And she's absolutely the one that Genji actually loves the most.

581
00:38:13,935 --> 00:38:14,840
Speaker 0: that's still alive.

582
00:38:16,801 --> 00:38:27,780
Speaker 0: But it was interesting how- When she dies, there's like a whole chapter of people crying, whereas other people, like an emperor dies in like a sentence, like a middle of a paragraph, when Murasaki dies.

583
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:32,440
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, there's more text for Murasaki's death than there is for Genji's death.

584
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,640
Speaker 0: Yep, but- There's just so much mourning and wailing and whatnot.

585
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:39,900
Speaker 1: But Genji definitely does not like fully appreciate her until it's too late.

586
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,345
Speaker 1: Yeah, like he gives up.

587
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:43,519
Speaker 1: He doesn't interact with her that much.

588
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:53,234
Speaker 0: No, but he's also a jerk to the very end because even at the end, right, she really wants to go, you know, become a nun or whatever, and Genji is like,

589
00:38:53,336 --> 00:38:53,518
Speaker 0: "No."

590
00:38:54,741 --> 00:38:57,539
Speaker 0: He doesn't let her until, you know, basically ever.

591
00:38:58,025 --> 00:38:58,260
Speaker 1: Yep.

592
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,040
Speaker 0: Even though that's what she really wanted.

593
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,200
Speaker 1: She's very clearly trying to be a nun to kind of get away from his crap.

594
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:04,407
Speaker 0: Yeah.

595
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,800
Speaker 0: Anyway, Murasaki, you know, the author is named after her, right?

596
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:12,140
Speaker 0: Yeah.

597
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:20,600
Speaker 0: You know, extremely important part, this whole grooming thing is like, I guess like it's almost like the main thread of the whole first two parts of the book, right?

598
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,520
Speaker 0: It's, I guess, bigger than any other threads.

599
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:27,860
Speaker 0: All right, so one more to get the Akashi lady, right?

600
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:33,419
Speaker 0: So Genji's like out in this, I guess, place called Akashi, I guess, I don't know.

601
00:39:35,324 --> 00:39:41,680
Speaker 1: And he gets with this Akashi lady- That was when the after exile, he went with that captain, right?

602
00:39:43,486 --> 00:39:44,419
Speaker 0: It was hard to follow.

603
00:39:44,521 --> 00:39:44,852
Speaker 1: Yeah.

604
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,059
Speaker 0: And it was so early in the book, I read it like at least a year ago.

605
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:57,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I want to say he goes out there with her, with him, and that dude is just like, "Holy shit, Genji's perfect, and I think he has the hottest of my daughter.

606
00:39:57,741 --> 00:39:59,913
Speaker 1: I have to make sure they have

607
00:39:59,994 --> 00:40:00,215
Speaker 1: sex.".

608
00:40:02,287 --> 00:40:04,600
Speaker 0: But anyway, the Akashi lady, right?

609
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,220
Speaker 0: You know, Genji likes her, I guess.

610
00:40:06,463 --> 00:40:06,635
Speaker 0: Okay.

611
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:16,960
Speaker 0: And she ends up, you know, moving to his house, but she sort of just like lives in the house quietly on her own, off in a corner somewhere, and doesn't get a lot of attention from anybody.

612
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:24,799
Speaker 0: She's just sort of like, "Well, I guess, you know, I got with Genji once, and now I live here, and I guess I'm living comfortably.

613
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:25,653
Speaker 0: Okay.".

614
00:40:25,822 --> 00:40:25,996
Speaker 1: Yep.

615
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:26,757
Speaker 1: But that's his father.

616
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:36,890
Speaker 1: The father was, I'm pretty sure it was her father, was just really trying to get them together, vaguely hoping Genji would marry her, just to give her wealth and a better life.

617
00:40:37,862 --> 00:40:46,016
Speaker 1: There was definitely a sitcom plot around them conspiring to get Genji to like her enough to maybe marry her.

618
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:47,677
Speaker 1: It was like this long shot.

619
00:40:48,340 --> 00:41:05,839
Speaker 0: But anyway, the Akashi lady's daughter ends up being a huge plot point in the second half of the book, because this whole thing of Genji trying to set her up with a good life and get her married to the right person, right?

620
00:41:06,643 --> 00:41:11,140
Speaker 0: He ends up being able to get her married to the emperor, ends up being the fourth emperor, right?

621
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:17,720
Speaker 0: He basically sets her up with the heir, while the third emperor, Reize, is the emperor.

622
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,500
Speaker 0: He gets her set up with the heir, who's still a kid at the time.

623
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,240
Speaker 1: Reize, remember, is Genji's actual child with his fake mom.

624
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

625
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:39,420
Speaker 0: So when Genji's biological son is the emperor, he gets the Akashi lady's daughter, hooked up with his, I guess, his grandson, right?

626
00:41:39,741 --> 00:41:45,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, because the fourth emperor would be... Oh no, because the fourth emperor isn't the son of Reize.

627
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:49,900
Speaker 1: No, the fourth emperor is the child of the second emperor, Suzaku.

628
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,600
Speaker 1: Let me find that fucking chart that you sent me before.

629
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,680
Speaker 1: I got a tab open here somewhere.

630
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,919
Speaker 0: The second emperor's son is the fourth emperor.

631
00:41:57,381 --> 00:42:02,359
Speaker 1: Yes, Suzaku emperor married someone on the right, and then that is the emperor that the Akashi princess.

632
00:42:02,843 --> 00:42:16,758
Speaker 1: That's sort of what I meant about a sort of constructed feeling that maybe we'll talk about more in the meta show, where the first two-thirds of this book is almost like the map of relationships just centers around Genji directly, because that's what's driving the story.

633
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:30,777
Speaker 1: But the last third of the book almost feels like the author took those relationships and constructed the drama they wanted from all the characters that were available from the first part of the book.

634
00:42:32,303 --> 00:42:34,000
Speaker 1: That's just kind of how it felt to me as the reader.

635
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:56,420
Speaker 0: And so then you come to, I guess, in the second part of the book, where Genji's got the house and everything, there's a major drama that develops with regards to Suzaku's daughter, So Suzaku has a bunch of... The second emperor, Suzaku, has a bunch of daughters.

636
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:02,520
Speaker 1: The one who was emperor when Genji was exiled, partly because of drama from his own family.

637
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:03,774
Speaker 1: He liked Genji.

638
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:04,819
Speaker 0: His half brother.

639
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:12,678
Speaker 0: So his half brother has daughters, but the half brother is going to go into the mountains to live.

640
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,100
Speaker 1: Well, because he had to advocate because he was probably sick.

641
00:43:17,108 --> 00:43:18,160
Speaker 1: He couldn't do his job anymore.

642
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:25,540
Speaker 0: And so he's trying to get these daughters set up with good lives before he leaves.

643
00:43:25,606 --> 00:43:25,760
Speaker 0: Right.

644
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:26,978
Speaker 0: So someone can support them.

645
00:43:27,921 --> 00:43:29,859
Speaker 0: And he's basically Hemen and Haag.

646
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,720
Speaker 0: And the daughter he cares about most is the third one.

647
00:43:32,881 --> 00:43:36,199
Speaker 0: He's got these other ones, but he cares about the third one the most.

648
00:43:37,264 --> 00:43:40,359
Speaker 1: Well, because she's the daughter of the Fujitsubo.

649
00:43:40,761 --> 00:43:42,260
Speaker 1: Like that line.

650
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,620
Speaker 0: Well, but she was the daughter.

651
00:43:45,082 --> 00:43:53,159
Speaker 0: I forget if that was the... I forget which daughter is the one that like, you know, hangs a piece of paper on the post when they move out of the house.

652
00:43:53,663 --> 00:43:54,376
Speaker 1: Oh, God.

653
00:43:54,943 --> 00:43:56,520
Speaker 0: There was like a whole big thing about that.

654
00:43:56,721 --> 00:43:57,396
Speaker 1: I think that was her.

655
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:01,159
Speaker 1: I always get confused with Fujitsubo.

656
00:44:01,822 --> 00:44:02,939
Speaker 1: The Fujitsubo princess.

657
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,840
Speaker 1: Fujitsubo something happens a lot in that part of the book.

658
00:44:07,481 --> 00:44:09,280
Speaker 0: There's a lot of names that are reused.

659
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,660
Speaker 0: For example, right.

660
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:14,440
Speaker 0: You know, Genji lives in a house called Rokujo.

661
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,338
Speaker 0: What is Rokujo?

662
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:19,780
Speaker 0: It's literally, you know, Hachi Roku, like Initial D. It's 6th Street.

663
00:44:20,581 --> 00:44:24,218
Speaker 0: His house is on the 6th Street in the city where the palace is.

664
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:28,160
Speaker 1: Which was very obvious when I saw the map at the end of this book.

665
00:44:28,883 --> 00:44:30,539
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's another house called Ichijo.

666
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,380
Speaker 0: That's on the 1st Street.

667
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:35,180
Speaker 0: There's a different, like, noble house on each street.

668
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:48,040
Speaker 0: And the people, because it's, I guess, impolite to refer to them by name, they'll be like, oh, you know, when they talk about, like, you know, the Koki Den concert, that's like the concert that lives in the Koki Den.

669
00:44:48,141 --> 00:44:50,119
Speaker 1: It's like I'm the Crescent Street podcaster.

670
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:59,920
Speaker 0: Like an area in the palace, the areas of the palace, the wings, have different names, and people get named after the wing that they live in or the house that they live in.

671
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:06,000
Speaker 1: Oh, Scott, I heard the Packard Square podcaster is talking about the tale of Genji with the Astoria podcaster.

672
00:45:06,761 --> 00:45:07,606
Speaker 0: Right, exactly.

673
00:45:07,646 --> 00:45:10,100
Speaker 0: That's how they're referring to people, right?

674
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,676
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, yeah, the Queens boy and the Texas boy, right?

675
00:45:14,841 --> 00:45:20,480
Speaker 0: The Madison Avenue guy and the Times Square guy, you know, that's what's going on here.

676
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:29,200
Speaker 0: So that's why it gets confusing when people move, because people move, their name fucking changes, and it's some name someone else had before.

677
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:35,640
Speaker 0: They'll be like a Rokujo lady, and then there'll be another Rokujo lady who's not the same one as the last Rokujo lady.

678
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:36,252
Speaker 0: Yup.

679
00:45:38,092 --> 00:45:38,320
Speaker 0: Anyway.

680
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:45,900
Speaker 1: In fact, the Rokujo lady had a daughter that married, that was the daughter that married the emperor that was Genji's son, the Reizei emperor.

681
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:47,440
Speaker 0: Anyway.

682
00:45:51,666 --> 00:46:01,619
Speaker 0: So, the second emperor is trying to figure out, you know, I gotta give this third princess that's my most important princess, I gotta get her the best husband, who do I give her to?

683
00:46:02,022 --> 00:46:03,559
Speaker 1: The best person I know, Genji.

684
00:46:04,343 --> 00:46:08,440
Speaker 0: Right, he's like, he thinks about all these other options, he doesn't like Genji.

685
00:46:09,221 --> 00:46:14,760
Speaker 0: You can tell he recognizes the reasons not to go for Genji, which there are many.

686
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:20,358
Speaker 0: But when he looks at everyone else, he's like, I guess it'll be Genji then, right?

687
00:46:22,401 --> 00:46:26,780
Speaker 1: I got the impression he had mixed feelings, because he liked Genji in some ways.

688
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,760
Speaker 1: He's actually pretty nice to Genji, considering what he knows Genji did.

689
00:46:31,829 --> 00:46:32,038
Speaker 0: Yup.

690
00:46:32,982 --> 00:46:39,220
Speaker 0: But anyway, so, Genji ends up sort of being forced to marry this princess that he's not really interested in.

691
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:48,260
Speaker 1: Well, the emperor publicly asks him, meaning, he can't say no, there's no consequence of saying no except personal ruin.

692
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:49,378
Speaker 0: Yup.

693
00:46:50,020 --> 00:47:05,418
Speaker 0: And so the book portrays this third princess, right, basically as an annoying child, right, that doesn't, you know, she's not very talented, whatever, but Genji's forced to spend a lot of time with her, even though he doesn't want to, just because he has to, right?

694
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:12,100
Speaker 0: And then Murasaki, the groomed wife that he actually likes, you know, is upset about that.

695
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:12,445
Speaker 1: Yup.

696
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:15,110
Speaker 0: Why aren't you spending time with me?

697
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:20,053
Speaker 1: Why are you spending time with this annoying- You spent all this time grooming me, and now you're not even gonna hang around with that brat?

698
00:47:20,073 --> 00:47:20,194
Speaker 1: Great.

699
00:47:22,242 --> 00:47:23,180
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go be a nun.

700
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:24,661
Speaker 0: Yup.

701
00:47:25,302 --> 00:47:32,700
Speaker 0: So, you know, Genji doesn't, you know, actually seem to like the third princess, but he's sort of forced into it, he doesn't have much of a choice.

702
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:33,192
Speaker 0: Yup.

703
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:45,740
Speaker 0: And so now he's got like four ladies living in his house, all in different wings, all with different names, but, you know, basically this third princess and Murasaki are the ones that matter in terms of the plot the most.

704
00:47:46,000 --> 00:48:03,440
Speaker 1: Now, one thing that I thought was really interesting about that, as like the house in particular, was that throughout the book, you get glimpses of, like, all the women are cloistered separately from the men, obviously, and when we're zoomed in, we usually see all the men talking to each other, or Genji talking to, like, a woman through a screen.

705
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:07,460
Speaker 0: Well, they're usually also talking to people, not directly, but through messaging.

706
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:08,345
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, like through Yu Gao.

707
00:48:08,446 --> 00:48:10,980
Speaker 1: Yu Gao is like Genji's go-to, like, get a message.

708
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:22,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like they, you know, they talk to someone, and then the person goes and tells, you know, it's like a little back and forth with their servants sharing the messages between them, or always writing letters all the time.

709
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:38,020
Speaker 1: But it always, every time those things happen, it's clear that in the, like, on the side of the screen that the book doesn't portray, where all the women are hanging out, the women, like, all read the love letters together, and, like, they all know what's going on.

710
00:48:38,421 --> 00:48:46,056
Speaker 0: It'll be like a woman with, like, all of her, you know, I guess maidens and all sorts of, you know, retainers, and all these, like, a whole group of people.

711
00:48:46,076 --> 00:48:48,140
Speaker 0: You're not just talking to this one person, right?

712
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,218
Speaker 0: It's like they always have people near them.

713
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,993
Speaker 1: Like, when Genji writes some letters, the women are like, "You've got to respond to him, otherwise we look bad.

714
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:57,036
Speaker 1: Like, go have sex with him.

715
00:48:57,116 --> 00:48:57,758
Speaker 1: Seriously, come

716
00:48:57,858 --> 00:48:57,918
Speaker 1: on.".

717
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,667
Speaker 0: They're like, "Oh, this dude's so hot.

718
00:49:00,707 --> 00:49:01,693
Speaker 0: Why don't you want to bang him?

719
00:49:01,754 --> 00:49:02,438
Speaker 0: I'll bang him for

720
00:49:02,499 --> 00:49:02,599
Speaker 0: you.".

721
00:49:02,861 --> 00:49:04,269
Speaker 1: "Can I bang him for you?

722
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:04,792
Speaker 1: He won't even

723
00:49:04,833 --> 00:49:05,034
Speaker 1: know.".

724
00:49:06,724 --> 00:49:21,720
Speaker 1: That happens, like... But, uh, so, it felt like there was tons of drama just behind the screen that was, like, not really portrayed directly during those chapters of the book.

725
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:44,518
Speaker 1: Like, you get the impression all the women of the house were having all this drama around, like, the Genji situation, but that was just an undercurrent because the books... I don't think the books really ever go behind the screen except the one time where Genji's back there and he gets caught during that storm in, like, the 18th or 19th chapter.

726
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:53,299
Speaker 0: I mean, there are times where they talk about, like, "Oh, yeah, the people were busy and were elsewhere, so someone was able to get around and make

727
00:49:53,339 --> 00:49:53,620
Speaker 0: mischief.".

728
00:49:55,323 --> 00:50:02,138
Speaker 0: And so that is actually one of the most important parts where Kashiwagi, right, who's this guy?

729
00:50:02,158 --> 00:50:03,300
Speaker 0: the Intendant, right?

730
00:50:04,461 --> 00:50:07,580
Speaker 0: The Intendant is, like, sort of like a lesser Genji.

731
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:10,290
Speaker 0: You know, he's a talented... He was Genji's friend.

732
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:12,760
Speaker 0: He's a talented, wonderful dude, right?

733
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:17,620
Speaker 0: But he's actually in love with this third princess that Genji has been forced upon.

734
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, but he marries the other princess.

735
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:30,700
Speaker 0: Right, he's legally married to the second princess, but he doesn't really like her, and she, you know, is like... Right?

736
00:50:31,121 --> 00:50:32,460
Speaker 0: He likes the third princess.

737
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:36,492
Speaker 0: And the third princess is legally married to Genji, but doesn't really...

738
00:50:36,512 --> 00:50:38,960
Speaker 1: Well, she's just annoying and a problem generally.

739
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:52,540
Speaker 0: Right, but Kashiwagi actually loves the third princess, and so he eventually finds that, you know, he keeps going there and calling on her and finding excuses to get closer to her and whatnot, even though she stays so distant from him.

740
00:50:53,041 --> 00:50:56,019
Speaker 1: Kind of like what Genji was doing in the entire first third of the book.

741
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,040
Speaker 0: Yup.

742
00:50:57,641 --> 00:51:01,669
Speaker 0: He just keeps trying, and, you know, Genji's friends with him.

743
00:51:01,689 --> 00:51:06,999
Speaker 0: Genji likes him, so it's not that, you know, awkward for him to be around, hanging around his house, you know.

744
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:11,131
Speaker 1: But then his daughter is Kaworu.

745
00:51:12,214 --> 00:51:12,515
Speaker 1: Son.

746
00:51:12,816 --> 00:51:13,900
Speaker 1: His son is Kaworu.

747
00:51:14,581 --> 00:51:23,980
Speaker 0: Right, so he gets, finally, you know, the right timing, right, when there's not a lot of ladies behind the screen, besides that third princess.

748
00:51:24,761 --> 00:51:30,320
Speaker 0: And he goes in there and makes his non-consensual move, right, as is so often in this book.

749
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:41,880
Speaker 1: It was... The thing that was interesting is, in the earlier parts of the book, the less consensual and non-consensual sexual encounters were much more, like, vaguely described.

750
00:51:42,361 --> 00:51:44,526
Speaker 1: This one was very much more, like, "Now's my

751
00:51:44,566 --> 00:51:44,987
Speaker 1: chance!"

752
00:51:45,087 --> 00:51:46,050
Speaker 1: and he, like, storms in.

753
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:50,580
Speaker 1: Like, it was much more abrupt and it felt more violent the way it was written.

754
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:51,680
Speaker 0: Yeah.

755
00:51:51,881 --> 00:51:57,852
Speaker 0: I mean, this book will never say, like, in it, like, "They fucked," but the book will be like, "Ah, yes.

756
00:51:58,754 --> 00:52:01,459
Speaker 0: They, uh, you know, he stayed there

757
00:52:01,539 --> 00:52:01,739
Speaker 0: late.".

758
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:02,539
Speaker 1: Yup.

759
00:52:03,422 --> 00:52:03,905
Speaker 0: It's like, "Wink,

760
00:52:03,946 --> 00:52:04,248
Speaker 0: wink!".

761
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:06,079
Speaker 0: You know, it's that kind of deal.

762
00:52:06,661 --> 00:52:12,190
Speaker 0: But this scene was, like, yes, he stormed through the curtain and carried her, you know.

763
00:52:12,531 --> 00:52:13,132
Speaker 0: It's, like, up.

764
00:52:13,372 --> 00:52:14,594
Speaker 0: He's, like, picked her up.

765
00:52:14,635 --> 00:52:16,718
Speaker 0: He's got his hands on her and they actually said that.

766
00:52:16,798 --> 00:52:17,299
Speaker 0: It's, like, up.

767
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:17,740
Speaker 0: They did it.

768
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:18,108
Speaker 0: Yup.

769
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,127
Speaker 0: They made babies.

770
00:52:19,672 --> 00:52:20,258
Speaker 0: And sure enough...

771
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:21,440
Speaker 1: They made one baby, at least.

772
00:52:22,162 --> 00:52:30,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, the baby that they make, the Intendant and the Third Princess, right, is Kaoru, who's the main character of the final part of the book.

773
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:30,876
Speaker 0: Yeah.

774
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:38,020
Speaker 0: Who is, you know, I guess legally Genji's son, but biologically almost definitely the Intendant Kashiwagi's son.

775
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:38,823
Speaker 0: Yup.

776
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:40,759
Speaker 1: Oh, and so in this chart...

777
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,500
Speaker 0: That's the major drama of the second part.

778
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:45,586
Speaker 1: ...in this chart I'm looking at to remember the names of all these characters.

779
00:52:45,646 --> 00:52:52,780
Speaker 1: So, this chart is great because it has a line for formal marriage, a line for child of doubtful parentage, which is what they use for that.

780
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:59,739
Speaker 1: Then there's a line for sexual relations without issue, and a line for sexual relations with issue.

781
00:53:01,062 --> 00:53:01,697
Speaker 0: Mhm, mhm.

782
00:53:02,101 --> 00:53:04,790
Speaker 1: And that describes the tale of Genji more than anything.

783
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:07,800
Speaker 1: It's those four types of relationships.

784
00:53:08,742 --> 00:53:08,882
Speaker 0: Yup.

785
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:14,592
Speaker 0: So that's pretty much the plot of, you know, all the significant plot points.

786
00:53:14,612 --> 00:53:19,180
Speaker 0: There's a lot of other little tiny side stories here and there that are brief or whatnot.

787
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:24,326
Speaker 1: There's one chapter that's basically just like... There was a chapter that really confused me.

788
00:53:24,346 --> 00:53:37,740
Speaker 1: It was around a little bit after the exile time, but reading, skimming over some footnotes, apparently that one was mostly allegory to well-known Chinese literature that anyone reading this book in a contemporary time would have known.

789
00:53:37,924 --> 00:53:38,538
Speaker 1: We just didn't know.

790
00:53:39,581 --> 00:53:39,741
Speaker 0: Yup.

791
00:53:40,462 --> 00:53:40,722
Speaker 0: Yup.

792
00:53:40,742 --> 00:53:42,784
Speaker 0: So, that's the plot, right?

793
00:53:43,245 --> 00:53:57,300
Speaker 0: As a plot goes, there are some parts of it that are interesting or compelling or dramatic, but overall, it's not like trying to say anything like a lot of modern novels do.

794
00:53:58,081 --> 00:54:08,220
Speaker 1: I think the third bit, like the college years after Genji dies, it might have been trying to say a little more, because think about how it actually ends.

795
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:10,237
Speaker 1: It ends with the...

796
00:54:10,521 --> 00:54:10,814
Speaker 0: Abruptly.

797
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:26,020
Speaker 1: But it ends abruptly with these sort of pseudo-Genji, like the cycle repeats, similar stories keep happening, but the difference is, he goes to like do the grand gesture to get the woman back after he uncovers that her death was faked and she's actually like okay.

798
00:54:26,642 --> 00:54:28,367
Speaker 1: And she's just like, nope, fuck you.

799
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:29,832
Speaker 1: And then it ends.

800
00:54:30,253 --> 00:54:32,520
Speaker 1: Like, nope, this isn't going to keep happening.

801
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:39,625
Speaker 0: Alright, so, just other things about the story itself, right?

802
00:54:39,645 --> 00:54:53,820
Speaker 0: So, you get this plot, and even though you could talk, you could describe the plot in much more detail, there are more things going on, but the ratio of words to things that happen is really low.

803
00:54:54,241 --> 00:55:03,280
Speaker 1: Especially considering the words don't often describe anything in particular, they tend to just set the mood for a scene.

804
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:15,268
Speaker 0: Well, set a mood for a scene or describe in ridiculous detail everything, like things that don't matter, right?

805
00:55:15,288 --> 00:55:31,540
Speaker 0: So they'll be like, if there's a festival going on, you could have several pages where they're like, this song was sung, and this person played this instrument, and they sounded great, and this person played this instrument in this mode, and they weren't as great, right?

806
00:55:32,242 --> 00:55:35,359
Speaker 0: And these flowers were blooming and they smelled like this.

807
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:39,335
Speaker 1: But then one sense in the middle of that will be like, oh yeah, this person's dead now.

808
00:55:39,476 --> 00:55:40,279
Speaker 1: And you're like, wait, wait, what?

809
00:55:40,459 --> 00:55:40,580
Speaker 1: What?

810
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:50,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're literally, it can't get over that like, oh yeah, this emperor died and the next emperor took over, and fast forward, like in a paragraph, in the middle of a paragraph.

811
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:55,385
Speaker 0: Like events, significant events in the world, right?

812
00:55:58,068 --> 00:56:08,840
Speaker 0: It's like, you got a chapter that took you an hour to read, you know, and half of it was just incredibly detailed descriptions of flowers or poems or whatever, right?

813
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:19,700
Speaker 0: And nothing happening, nothing advancing, none of the dramatic, you know, current circumstances being addressed, maybe not even any dialogue happening at all.

814
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:23,526
Speaker 0: And then maybe something will happen, right?

815
00:56:23,987 --> 00:56:30,140
Speaker 0: So if you just, I think, you know, there is an abridged edition, which we declined to read, and I guess that's good.

816
00:56:30,761 --> 00:56:40,017
Speaker 1: I'm glad we read the unabridged version because I feel like we would have lost, like there's a lot of just mood and feeling that I could have internalized reading something so old.

817
00:56:40,037 --> 00:56:41,679
Speaker 1: I'm glad I did it.

818
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:46,625
Speaker 0: But if you want just the plot, you can cut this book down a lot.

819
00:56:46,645 --> 00:56:58,980
Speaker 0: The plot could probably be, if you just tried to write the plot only, think, you know, characters doing things, things happening, and you use modern language even, you know, you could chop this thing down.

820
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:02,100
Speaker 0: 80% or more could just be done.

821
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:13,000
Speaker 1: This is something I actually don't want to dwell on because, one, we've gone almost an hour already and I want to save this for the more meta show, but something that struck me, there was a specific moment, again, around The Exile, because the writing style changed.

822
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:26,440
Speaker 1: Like a lot of things shift around that time, not just the plot and the characters like Genji growing up, but I think that around that is the first time a chapter ends and the next chapter just picks up where the previous one left off.

823
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:29,986
Speaker 1: Like it's the same contiguous story.

824
00:57:30,567 --> 00:57:38,440
Speaker 1: A lot of the earlier chapters, like a chapter ends and the next chapter is like three years later and Genji's with a totally different set of people.

825
00:57:39,501 --> 00:57:45,910
Speaker 0: Well, there's also times where it's like you'll have a chapter and they'll be like, this chapter covers from when Genji's 23 to when he's 24.

826
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:47,232
Speaker 0: It's like, okay.

827
00:57:47,593 --> 00:57:52,360
Speaker 0: And the next chapter will be like, oh, this chapter covers from when Genji's 22 to 25.

828
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:55,324
Speaker 0: It's sort of like, yeah, there'll be like.

829
00:57:55,364 --> 00:58:02,572
Speaker 0: on a modern book, what you would do is you would keep things quite often, you know, sometimes unintentionally, you know, you would unintentionally.

830
00:58:02,692 --> 00:58:09,120
Speaker 0: or sometimes in a modern book, you'll intentionally, you know, not be chronological, but in a clever way.

831
00:58:10,141 --> 00:58:16,820
Speaker 1: Like the best example of this I've seen in my modern reading of anything is that one culture book, Use of Weapons.

832
00:58:17,901 --> 00:58:18,061
Speaker 0: Yep.

833
00:58:18,822 --> 00:58:21,207
Speaker 0: So imagine, think about this in my life, right?

834
00:58:21,268 --> 00:58:23,332
Speaker 0: So imagine I was still commuting to work, right?

835
00:58:23,352 --> 00:58:27,240
Speaker 0: So I have my work life and then I have podcast convention life, right?

836
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:33,791
Speaker 0: So if you were going to write my life as a book, you'd be like, chapter one, Scott goes to work.

837
00:58:34,072 --> 00:58:36,496
Speaker 0: Chapter two, Scott comes home from working podcasts.

838
00:58:36,917 --> 00:58:38,540
Speaker 0: Chapter three, Scott goes back to work.

839
00:58:39,563 --> 00:58:43,272
Speaker 1: Chapter one, the paxes Scott went to for these four years.

840
00:58:43,532 --> 00:58:46,460
Speaker 1: Chapter two, Scott's job for these four years.

841
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:47,900
Speaker 0: Exactly.

842
00:58:48,101 --> 00:58:48,361
Speaker 0: Right.

843
00:58:48,662 --> 00:58:59,840
Speaker 0: So it's like it becomes really hard to tell, like, well, at the third pax in chapter two, it's like, was that like before or after the drama at Scott's work in chapter four?

844
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:06,532
Speaker 1: But I think part of that is that those worlds rarely intersect in this story.

845
00:59:06,773 --> 00:59:10,560
Speaker 1: The things that happen in two different threads do not affect each other.

846
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,943
Speaker 1: That breaks a little bit in the last third, though.

847
00:59:14,963 --> 00:59:27,160
Speaker 1: And that's sort of the stuff we want to talk about in the meta episode, because those later chapters, there's so much more like this character went here and did this and is talking to this person sitting in this place.

848
00:59:27,441 --> 00:59:31,431
Speaker 1: And then you get a bunch of dialogue that is like way more modern dialogue.

849
00:59:31,471 --> 00:59:32,293
Speaker 1: It goes longer.

850
00:59:32,373 --> 00:59:35,060
Speaker 1: It's structured more like a modern novel.

851
00:59:36,201 --> 00:59:42,940
Speaker 1: If you read chapter one of Genji and then chapter like forty eight of Genji back to back, they would not feel like they're the same book or the same author.

852
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:44,520
Speaker 0: Yeah.

853
00:59:44,601 --> 00:59:50,820
Speaker 0: But I guess in the case of Genji, you know, this sort of split up will be like, OK, Genji was courting three ladies at once.

854
00:59:51,882 --> 00:59:52,122
Speaker 0: Right.

855
00:59:52,302 --> 00:59:57,090
Speaker 0: But we're going to have one chapter that's going to tell you all the instances of Genji courting Lady one.

856
00:59:57,691 --> 01:00:03,100
Speaker 0: And then the next chapter will be all the instances of Genji courting Lady two, even though those things were happening concurrently.

857
01:00:04,141 --> 01:00:04,362
Speaker 0: Right.

858
01:00:04,382 --> 01:00:06,611
Speaker 0: There are two separate plots.

859
01:00:06,711 --> 01:00:09,020
Speaker 0: We're going to tell them to you in separate chapters.

860
01:00:10,241 --> 01:00:10,441
Speaker 1: Yep.

861
01:00:10,962 --> 01:00:19,039
Speaker 0: And so it becomes confusing, though, when you're trying to follow the sequence of who's who, what's happening, et cetera.

862
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:20,520
Speaker 1: Yep.

863
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:29,040
Speaker 1: But it almost like to read this book to enjoy if you're listening to this, but you chose not to read the book for whatever reason, we were alluding to this in our meta moments along the way.

864
01:00:30,122 --> 01:00:40,380
Speaker 1: If you just sort of roll with it, it is actually an enjoyable read if you're just willing to not fully understand exactly what happened when.

865
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:51,480
Speaker 1: Like the story of all his interactions with Fujitsubo, really compelling story like this is an adult and a man child having drama and it's a pretty good story.

866
01:00:51,801 --> 01:00:59,780
Speaker 1: But if you try to like chronologically remember exactly how that lines up with him going after Mers, just don't don't do not try.

867
01:01:00,261 --> 01:01:02,820
Speaker 1: It's not worth the effort unless you're doing lit crit on this book.

868
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:03,680
Speaker 0: Right.

869
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:15,820
Speaker 0: I think the only reason to read the unabridged as we did is if you want to get all of that historical context, you know, poetry, all you want to get all those extra meta bits in there.

870
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:22,980
Speaker 0: If you just want to enjoy the story that is happening here, I would strongly recommend going for an adaptation.

871
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:27,120
Speaker 0: I'm sure there's a manga that I've heard is good.

872
01:01:27,661 --> 01:01:31,040
Speaker 1: Emily's read a bunch of it because she's been doing Japanese lessons online for a long time.

873
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:35,400
Speaker 1: And what they do is like read this manga together and talk about it in Japanese.

874
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,591
Speaker 1: Like that's a good way to brush up on your Japanese.

875
01:01:37,953 --> 01:01:39,340
Speaker 1: But I kind of want to read this manga.

876
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,959
Speaker 1: I don't think it's translated anywhere.

877
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,345
Speaker 0: Oh, OK.

878
01:01:42,786 --> 01:01:46,500
Speaker 1: I feel like that would clarify some of the nuances that I probably missed.

879
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,920
Speaker 0: But also just being able to see people's faces would help with the name issue.

880
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:57,340
Speaker 1: You know, it'd be really funny if the manga is just Genji sitting in front of various differently drawn blinds for the entire thing.

881
01:01:58,102 --> 01:02:00,720
Speaker 0: But then you could remember which curtain was which based on what's drawn.

882
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:01,121
Speaker 0: Yeah.

883
01:02:03,004 --> 01:02:12,820
Speaker 1: But also, if you just read it, like just rolling through it, there are so many legitimately really, really funny scenes.

884
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:19,660
Speaker 1: There's the scene where he's having said they're having sex secretly and like the servants are right outside.

885
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:32,320
Speaker 1: Remember, like their beds are so like this woman is in a bed that is surrounded by curtains, that is itself surrounded by blinds, that is itself in a room that has windows that are covered by their own blinds with guards outside.

886
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:33,829
Speaker 1: Genji is in there.

887
01:02:34,051 --> 01:02:34,979
Speaker 1: They're having sex.

888
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:42,680
Speaker 1: And then a thunderstorm happens and the captain of the guard runs in to check on the women because he's one of the few men allowed to go to that room.

889
01:02:43,341 --> 01:02:44,400
Speaker 1: Guess who's hiding?

890
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:49,668
Speaker 1: Like that whole scene is really funny.

891
01:02:50,249 --> 01:02:55,823
Speaker 1: or the old lady he's having sex with where the husband finds out and it's just like, "Yeah, I'm too old for this shit.

892
01:02:55,843 --> 01:02:59,793
Speaker 1: You were welcome to sexually pleasure my wife, like by all

893
01:02:59,833 --> 01:03:00,074
Speaker 1: means.".

894
01:03:03,102 --> 01:03:15,860
Speaker 1: And if you read the like read the Tale of Genji to get those scenes, I feel like it's better to enjoy them in the utter bridge version just because you're almost reading and it takes you a minute to realize what's actually happening.

895
01:03:16,281 --> 01:03:21,316
Speaker 1: And suddenly it's really funny when you realize like, "Oh, oh shit, he's actually in that room right now.

896
01:03:21,436 --> 01:03:22,058
Speaker 1: Oh, I get it.

897
01:03:22,179 --> 01:03:22,499
Speaker 1: I get

898
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:22,560
Speaker 1: it.".

899
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:30,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like somehow if you just read and read and read and don't stop, don't try to go back and understand the sentence.

900
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:39,060
Speaker 0: It's like that barest hint of what happened that you smelled from afar, even though there's no clarity.

901
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,760
Speaker 0: It's like a blurry haze, but you can sort of make out a little bit what happened.

902
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:50,380
Speaker 0: If you just keep going, when you reach the end of like a big long paragraph, it'll still be a fuzzy picture, but it'll be enough.

903
01:03:51,841 --> 01:03:54,995
Speaker 0: And you'll understand enough to enjoy and follow.

904
01:03:56,300 --> 01:04:04,000
Speaker 1: He's trying to have sex with, I think he was trying to have sex with Fujitsu Bo early on, and he fucks up and ends up in like the wrong servants quarters.

905
01:04:04,781 --> 01:04:08,480
Speaker 1: So he basically just has sex with this random woman who's just sleeping there like quietly.

906
01:04:09,901 --> 01:04:13,618
Speaker 1: And later on, he's like, "Oh shit, I don't want to know who that

907
01:04:13,718 --> 01:04:13,778
Speaker 1: is.".

908
01:04:14,482 --> 01:04:17,119
Speaker 1: There's another time where he has sex with that woman, he doesn't know what she looks like.

909
01:04:17,461 --> 01:04:23,640
Speaker 1: And then he does shenanigans to figure out who it is, and he sees her, and she's really ugly, and he's mad, and you go.

910
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,439
Speaker 1: Loki makes fun of him for a while about it.

911
01:04:28,621 --> 01:04:29,243
Speaker 0: I guess I get.

912
01:04:29,343 --> 01:04:35,260
Speaker 0: one last thing is that the book has, surprisingly, a lot of supernatural stuff going on.

913
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:52,680
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, so it's not that first ghost murder I talk about a lot just because that's really early on, but Genji's wife was murdered by the spirit of another character who is still alive, and that is treated as absolutely real in this story.

914
01:04:52,920 --> 01:05:10,068
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's people who are sick, Buddhist priests, monks come in and try to pray the spirits away, and then people who are sick will suddenly rise up and start talking because the spirit that was possessing them and making them sick is trying to tell you what they're mad about.

915
01:05:10,088 --> 01:05:12,857
Speaker 0: That happens at least twice, I think.

916
01:05:13,278 --> 01:05:13,920
Speaker 0: That kind of thing.

917
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:17,487
Speaker 1: Yep, there are just ghosts and spirits.

918
01:05:17,748 --> 01:05:27,278
Speaker 1: Genji has a vision right before he goes out of exile where the dragon turtle king is like, "Hey, I got a daughter," and Genji's like, "I gotta get the fuck out of

919
01:05:27,319 --> 01:05:27,580
Speaker 1: town.".

920
01:05:28,561 --> 01:05:30,987
Speaker 0: Yep.

921
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:34,377
Speaker 0: And the other thing is that there's a lot of disease going around.

922
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:41,940
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, I mean, look, how many emperors abdicate because they're dying in their 40s of malaria?

923
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:48,440
Speaker 0: Right, well Genji, that's basically the thing, Genji lives as long as he does despite having malaria.

924
01:05:49,900 --> 01:06:01,400
Speaker 0: But it's like, other diseases are not so specific, you probably couldn't figure out what they were without, maybe you could never figure them out, because there's not enough information in the book, or some scholar knows,

925
01:06:01,982 --> 01:06:02,142
Speaker 1: but

926
01:06:02,503 --> 01:06:08,360
Speaker 0: you can see a lot of people get sick with various things at various times, their medical technology is not great.

927
01:06:11,181 --> 01:06:25,995
Speaker 0: There's just lots of sickness and unwellness is a frequent plot point amongst many people from Genji's legal wife, the Aoi, that he was forced to marry when he was young that he doesn't care about, up through everybody.

928
01:06:28,462 --> 01:06:39,300
Speaker 1: But I guess what I'd leave you with on this is, the plot by itself, like if you read a summary of the plot, there's not much there and it's not that interesting.

929
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:58,055
Speaker 1: It's only interesting to read summaries of the plot after you've read a bunch of the actual text to sort of bring it together, because the value, like what I enjoyed about this was reading the actual original text translated, and trying to just get myself into the mindset of this book from the year 1000-ish.

930
01:07:02,501 --> 01:07:14,380
Speaker 1: So, if you didn't read it, honestly, you can find copies of it, just read the first four or five chapters, just read a little bit of it, even if you just listen to this whole thing, you'll find something to enjoy.

931
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:20,180
Speaker 0: I think you should only read it if you have some interest, some reason to be interested.

932
01:07:20,782 --> 01:07:27,680
Speaker 0: If you're just a person who likes to read a book and you pick this up as a book, you're probably not going to have a good time.

933
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:39,118
Speaker 0: But if you care about history or poetry or culture or anything like that, then you're going to get the extra value from reading the actual text.

934
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:55,500
Speaker 1: I have this old book, I think I got rid of it eventually, I think we gave it away or I donated or something, but I had this book that I got at Atlantic Books long, long ago, and it was a collection of essays from Japanese authors in various ancient times.

935
01:07:55,741 --> 01:07:58,740
Speaker 1: It was that kind of book, the kind of book Rim would buy in Wildwood.

936
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:26,600
Speaker 1: But the first essay in that book, because I didn't read beyond that, this book was thick, was this guy from 1200s Japan, and he was reading ancient Chinese literature and his essay, he was sort of musing on how amazing it is to read the words a person from a thousand years ago wrote a thousand years later.

937
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:39,426
Speaker 1: And that stuck with me, especially because I was reading someone who himself had written that many hundreds of years before I came in, and humans have been doing this forever.

938
01:08:39,846 --> 01:08:43,915
Speaker 1: So even if you don't do it with the Tale of Genji, do it with something.

939
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:45,880
Speaker 1: Read an old book.

940
01:08:46,386 --> 01:08:47,080
Speaker 0: We read The Odyssey.

941
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:49,764
Speaker 1: Yeah, like read something old at least once.

942
01:08:49,844 --> 01:08:59,380
Speaker 1: And honestly, The Odyssey, the Emily Wilson translation, it is really, really accessible, like way more than you'd think from a book written in BC.

943
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:00,781
Speaker 0: Yep.

944
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:04,167
Speaker 0: So yeah, we're going to do one more.

945
01:09:04,548 --> 01:09:11,479
Speaker 0: Since we put so much effort into reading this incredibly long book over such a long period of time, we are going to do at least one more episode.

946
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:18,200
Speaker 0: We're going to talk about not the actual content of the story, but all sorts of meta stuff around the book.

947
01:09:18,661 --> 01:09:22,060
Speaker 1: I got so much to say I've been holding back on in this episode.

948
01:09:22,761 --> 01:09:23,082
Speaker 0: Yep.

949
01:09:23,122 --> 01:09:27,956
Speaker 0: So we'll let that all out because clearly we need to, and we need episode ideas, especially for Thursday.

950
01:09:27,975 --> 01:09:29,180
Speaker 0: So you might as well.

951
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:32,366
Speaker 0: But we've also, Rym, selected another book.

952
01:09:32,587 --> 01:09:38,060
Speaker 0: And this book is a S-tier book that is very, the opposite of the Tale of Genji.

953
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:43,200
Speaker 0: And relatively speaking, it is like, you know, extremely new novel.

954
01:09:44,441 --> 01:09:48,778
Speaker 0: And I, when I knew that it existed, I said, "I am reading the fuck out of

955
01:09:48,818 --> 01:09:49,019
Speaker 0: that.".

956
01:09:49,481 --> 01:09:53,420
Speaker 0: Even before Rym selected it as the book club book, I knew I was going to read the fuck out of it.

957
01:09:53,520 --> 01:10:00,340
Speaker 0: But I said, when I, when I heard of the book's existence, I thought to myself two things.

958
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:04,047
Speaker 0: The first thing I thought was it's going to be a series.

959
01:10:04,107 --> 01:10:05,650
Speaker 0: It's the first book in a series.

960
01:10:06,231 --> 01:10:11,060
Speaker 0: Therefore, I'm going to hold out and not read it until that series is done.

961
01:10:11,641 --> 01:10:14,558
Speaker 0: Rym foiled that plan by selecting it as a book club book.

962
01:10:15,721 --> 01:10:21,114
Speaker 1: Because I learned, Emily read it, so I got a lot of like, "Rym, you should read it.

963
01:10:21,375 --> 01:10:23,279
Speaker 1: Here's a thing about the book that will intrigue

964
01:10:23,299 --> 01:10:23,400
Speaker 1: you.".

965
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:27,697
Speaker 1: And everything Emily said was very much, "Hey, Rym, we have to read this

966
01:10:27,738 --> 01:10:27,918
Speaker 1: book.".

967
01:10:28,521 --> 01:10:29,870
Speaker 0: I knew I had to read this book.

968
01:10:29,910 --> 01:10:31,500
Speaker 0: I just wanted to wait to read the book.

969
01:10:31,881 --> 01:10:33,259
Speaker 1: So the next book club book is?

970
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:34,282
Speaker 0: Wait, wait, wait.

971
01:10:34,303 --> 01:10:40,279
Speaker 0: So then the second thing that I thought to myself was we should not select this as a book club book.

972
01:10:41,861 --> 01:10:44,952
Speaker 0: Because I don't want to keep doing authors.

973
01:10:44,992 --> 01:10:45,695
Speaker 0: We already did.

974
01:10:45,735 --> 01:10:47,000
Speaker 0: I like, we got to mix it up.

975
01:10:47,521 --> 01:10:48,945
Speaker 1: You are Scott Becker.

976
01:10:48,965 --> 01:10:53,779
Speaker 1: You've, uh, you're, you're, you have decelerated at a rate that is worrying to me.

977
01:10:55,583 --> 01:10:57,760
Speaker 0: But anyway, this is Rym's choice.

978
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:01,456
Speaker 1: The City We Became by N.K.

979
01:11:01,497 --> 01:11:01,939
Speaker 1: Jemisin.

980
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:09,040
Speaker 0: I am already, so it took us two and a half years, however long, since June 2020 to read the Tale of Genji.

981
01:11:09,941 --> 01:11:13,931
Speaker 0: I started reading this book this year and it's only February 3rd.

982
01:11:14,052 --> 01:11:15,335
Speaker 0: I am 80% done with this book.

983
01:11:17,762 --> 01:11:17,843
Speaker 1: Yep.

984
01:11:17,863 --> 01:11:20,592
Speaker 0: Partly because you were under the misa- The day it was announced, I'm 80% done already.

985
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,980
Speaker 1: You were under the misapprehension that I had already read it and we could knock out a book club book.

986
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:26,264
Speaker 1: I have not read this book yet.

987
01:11:26,324 --> 01:11:31,400
Speaker 1: I read the prologue and then I stopped on purpose because I was going to, I committed to finishing Genji.

988
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:32,879
Speaker 1: I finished fucking Genji.

989
01:11:33,482 --> 01:11:33,722
Speaker 0: Right.

990
01:11:33,783 --> 01:11:39,420
Speaker 0: So we have the opposite problem now where we need to give the listener time to read the book if they haven't already.

991
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:45,800
Speaker 0: So listener will probably do an episode on this book in, I guess, March, April at the earliest, right?

992
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:47,949
Speaker 0: Give you some time to get the book and read it.

993
01:11:48,110 --> 01:11:50,140
Speaker 0: Of course, it didn't take me that long at all.

994
01:11:51,141 --> 01:11:56,440
Speaker 0: I'm going to be done probably in two, three sittings more at the most because it's easy to read.

995
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:58,440
Speaker 0: Compared to Genji, oh God, it's easy to read.

996
01:11:58,641 --> 01:11:58,862
Speaker 1: Yep.

997
01:11:59,083 --> 01:11:59,485
Speaker 1: It is.

998
01:11:59,806 --> 01:12:02,880
Speaker 1: It is kind of like how we played some PUBG the other day.

999
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:07,420
Speaker 1: And then when I played Fortnite the next night, it was like, wow, this is just such a breath of fresh air.

1000
01:12:07,541 --> 01:12:09,131
Speaker 1: Like it does not take effort.

1001
01:12:09,413 --> 01:12:10,359
Speaker 1: I can just enjoy this.

1002
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:11,340
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1003
01:12:11,441 --> 01:12:17,000
Speaker 0: Also, now that I don't have any guilt of like I'm reading, you know, because I felt guilty whenever I read something that wasn't Genji.

1004
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:18,440
Speaker 0: Like I should be reading Genji.

1005
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:18,661
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

1006
01:12:18,681 --> 01:12:23,940
Speaker 1: I've got this great book that is like the history of liberalism as a concept in human history.

1007
01:12:24,703 --> 01:12:28,440
Speaker 1: And I forced myself to stop reading it because I wanted to finish Genji.

1008
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:29,700
Speaker 0: Yep.

1009
01:12:29,881 --> 01:12:40,280
Speaker 0: But now that that guilt is gone, I am like reading, you know, not just this book, but like all reading like, you know, comics and also like voraciously like, ah, I don't, I can't, I don't have to feel guilty reading this other stuff.

1010
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:42,083
Speaker 0: I'm just reading up a storm now.

1011
01:12:42,224 --> 01:12:49,620
Speaker 0: So, uh, you know, and I already got some good ideas for a book club book after we read this one.

1012
01:12:50,181 --> 01:12:52,466
Speaker 0: I guess that would be the summer reading book, right?

1013
01:12:52,667 --> 01:12:55,132
Speaker 0: So we'll see.

1014
01:12:55,152 --> 01:12:55,654
Speaker 0: All right.

1015
01:12:55,674 --> 01:12:58,380
Speaker 0: We're finally, we're finally halfway done with this Genji.

1016
01:13:03,081 --> 01:13:05,327
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1017
01:13:05,367 --> 01:13:10,360

1023
01:13:31,511 --> 01:13:34,380
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1024
01:13:34,842 --> 01:13:46,740
Speaker 1: And the Patreon patrons for this much awaited episode of the Geek Nights Book Club are... Heidi McNichol, Alan Joyce, Lynn Geegee, Dread Lily Tenerbrait, and a bunch of people who really don't want me to say their names.

1027
01:14:04,541 --> 01:14:06,345
Speaker 1: It took us a while, like Scott said.

1028
01:14:06,365 --> 01:14:07,588
Speaker 1: Yeah, we got some excuses.

1029
01:14:08,470 --> 01:14:12,980
Speaker 1: Only about 20% of that delay was intrinsic to us.

1030
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,806
Speaker 1: The rest was due to circumstance.

1031
01:14:14,886 --> 01:14:18,600
Speaker 1: But anyway, for now, I simply leave you with...
