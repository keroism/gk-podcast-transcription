1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,541
Speaker 1: It's Monday April 27th 2020.

2
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:12,962
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,524 --> 00:00:15,509
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:22,389
Speaker 1: tonight We're talking about our TMP streaming and how we have set it up to record geek nights from home.

5
00:00:23,692 --> 00:00:24,423
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,938 --> 00:00:31,850
Speaker 1: So, uh Normally at the beginning of the show we have our little opening bit where we talk about stuff.

7
00:00:32,271 --> 00:00:43,490
Speaker 1: There was we were doing which usually in the summer boils down to so I was biking somewhere and X happened or so I biked somewhere and Y happened, but we're not going anywhere doing anything.

8
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,403
Speaker 0: Yeah, but staying at home doing nothing I did.

9
00:00:46,423 --> 00:00:47,930
Speaker 1: it was really nice on Saturday.

10
00:00:48,051 --> 00:00:50,950
Speaker 1: So we biked down to Prospect Park and did a bunch of loops and came back.

11
00:00:51,831 --> 00:01:02,590
Speaker 0: Mmm, there's a lot of people I see in the New York Internet communities and the common post people seem to be making is Hey, look at all these too many people outside, what are they doing?

12
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:08,550
Speaker 0: They got to go back inside and it's every single time the photo they post of too many people includes them.

13
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:12,970
Speaker 0: It's like everyone goes outside and takes a picture and says what are all these other people doing outside?

14
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,075
Speaker 0: I need to be out here.

15
00:01:14,236 --> 00:01:15,542
Speaker 1: So biking some doing it, right?

16
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:16,950
Speaker 0: I've allowed to be out here.

17
00:01:17,171 --> 00:01:18,436
Speaker 1: I think I realized what's going on.

18
00:01:18,476 --> 00:01:22,190
Speaker 1: the problem even though there's no good solution to this is pedestrians.

19
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:27,008
Speaker 1: Because basically what's happening now that I've biked around in the city a whole bunch during this thing?

20
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:30,006
Speaker 1: The cyclists seem to be fine because they keep their distance.

21
00:01:30,046 --> 00:01:36,335
Speaker 1: they're moving fast Like you're not next to anyone for more than like a half a second But the pedestrians.

22
00:01:36,395 --> 00:01:42,194
Speaker 1: there's way more people out like if you go to any park anywhere any like walking path anything Especially along the rivers.

23
00:01:42,696 --> 00:01:46,830
Speaker 1: There's more people that are normally out at this time of year like everybody's outside.

24
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:53,277
Speaker 1: I think they're getting stir-crazy, but they're all just walking and it's people who don't normally walk like they're not out there Normally like it's not that crowded.

25
00:01:53,317 --> 00:02:00,870
Speaker 1: But now that everybody's going out to walk to get outside There's giant blobs of pedestrians everywhere making on crowded and dangerous situations.

26
00:02:01,632 --> 00:02:12,145
Speaker 0: Well, a lot of other cities made the right move of basically closing roads or as we like to call it opening roads To people in the war on cars community.

27
00:02:12,628 --> 00:02:14,905
Speaker 0: Yes Open the streets, right?

28
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,017
Speaker 0: You know, it's like Oakland is actually crazy.

29
00:02:18,118 --> 00:02:23,857
Speaker 0: open the streets, you know, cuz it's like hey, there's not too many cars And people don't need to be driving.

30
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:34,610
Speaker 0: let's if we open the streets there's more room for people to walk so They could go not be near each other right and New York be mostly because of the mayor.

31
00:02:34,912 --> 00:02:37,104
Speaker 0: You know, the City Council is like open the streets.

32
00:02:37,185 --> 00:02:37,909
Speaker 0: I'm a kid, right?

33
00:02:39,432 --> 00:02:40,055
Speaker 1: Yeah, just open.

34
00:02:40,115 --> 00:02:42,627
Speaker 0: Oh, they just the mayor of New York and the college like.

35
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:43,310
Speaker 1: there's an easy solution.

36
00:02:44,351 --> 00:02:49,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, mostly the the mayor and the police have been hesitant to open the streets to give people more room.

37
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,438
Speaker 1: Well, cuz I might set a bad precedent.

38
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,550
Speaker 1: people might realize they like the streets being closed.

39
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:59,850
Speaker 0: Well, they do like the streets being open, but they're they're gonna you know, yeah today they announced they're gonna do something.

40
00:03:00,051 --> 00:03:00,676
Speaker 1: But I know.

41
00:03:00,777 --> 00:03:02,997
Speaker 1: but this is what actually happens I noticed.

42
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:08,709
Speaker 1: so if I go out of these parks I have to avoid like all the nice places to go because there's a million people clogging everything up.

43
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:21,850
Speaker 1: but because of that all the people who are running are Running in the bike paths and the bike lanes to get away from all the slow Pedestrians that are making it unsafe for them because if they just run they're also safe because they're not really next to anyone.

44
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:24,118
Speaker 0: Yeah, people are trying to dodge people more.

45
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:27,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, so they spread out and block the bike lanes.

46
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:30,664
Speaker 1: So the bikers now are stuck behind all the people see.

47
00:03:30,684 --> 00:03:33,303
Speaker 0: normally I would just if I you know And I'm gonna when it gets warm.

48
00:03:33,323 --> 00:03:33,930
Speaker 0: I'm gonna bike.

49
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,682
Speaker 0: I'll just bike away from the city to where it's not crowded.

50
00:03:36,702 --> 00:03:38,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, right out in the middle of nowhere.

51
00:03:38,691 --> 00:03:45,557
Speaker 0: The problem is if I buy too far I got to like take a train home and I want to do that And also little things like.

52
00:03:45,637 --> 00:03:47,806
Speaker 1: I got to carry all the equipment I could possibly need.

53
00:03:47,846 --> 00:03:49,051
Speaker 1: I got to carry all the food I could Need.

54
00:03:49,071 --> 00:03:52,190
Speaker 1: I can't just do my old go-to of just stop at a restaurant.

55
00:03:52,553 --> 00:03:53,059
Speaker 1: I need food.

56
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,533
Speaker 0: you can't stop at a restaurant But you could.

57
00:03:54,553 --> 00:03:56,747
Speaker 0: there are places you can still stop like you know.

58
00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:05,741
Speaker 0: yeah Depending on where you are Especially if you have someone with you right cuz you know wouldn't bike super close to the first in your with right But you could you know be like all right.

59
00:04:05,761 --> 00:04:06,766
Speaker 0: you stand here with the bikes.

60
00:04:06,826 --> 00:04:09,958
Speaker 0: I'll go in the grocery Yep, I'll get food.

61
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:12,047
Speaker 0: We'll sit here on these benches eat the food.

62
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:13,634
Speaker 1: yep I'm vaguely planning.

63
00:04:13,714 --> 00:04:17,990
Speaker 1: some sit six feet apart and picnic and in like flushing or something later.

64
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:18,753
Speaker 0: I just can't.

65
00:04:18,773 --> 00:04:24,177
Speaker 0: you just can't do like a group bike ride where you're like lined up right on top each other like you know Normally do.

66
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,815
Speaker 1: but something else happened That was sort of annoying.

67
00:04:27,177 --> 00:04:30,690
Speaker 1: well other than the blobs of people because the blobs of people is annoying as they are.

68
00:04:31,111 --> 00:04:40,670
Speaker 1: They're easy to avoid if you just don't go to the places that are very obviously going to be popular to those people like If you come in one street from the river ghost town.

69
00:04:41,332 --> 00:04:44,323
Speaker 0: I just remember all kinds of things like you know smorgasburg.

70
00:04:44,383 --> 00:04:44,925
Speaker 0: It's like rip.

71
00:04:45,488 --> 00:04:46,070
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

72
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:56,370
Speaker 1: The Kent Avenue bike path is like jam-packed With slow people wobbling around to the point that I can't go over there like go take Bedford or something instead.

73
00:04:57,811 --> 00:05:04,391
Speaker 1: Anyway, but so the thing I noticed is there's a lot of people biking who have clearly never biked before which on one hand is Good.

74
00:05:04,734 --> 00:05:06,970
Speaker 1: it is people who are stir crazy, and they're going outside.

75
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,149
Speaker 1: They're getting on a city bike.

76
00:05:08,571 --> 00:05:17,809
Speaker 1: But I witnessed like three different almost catastrophic accidents because there's a lot of people biking now Who have no idea how to bike?

77
00:05:18,771 --> 00:05:21,261
Speaker 1: Yeah, like way more than normal.

78
00:05:21,281 --> 00:05:26,043
Speaker 0: I mean people try to do things They don't know how to do all the time, and that's good.

79
00:05:26,104 --> 00:05:27,210
Speaker 0: It's how you learn how to do things.

80
00:05:27,472 --> 00:05:28,016
Speaker 1: But they're doing.

81
00:05:28,056 --> 00:05:34,090
Speaker 1: it can be bad on a crowded street Almost having head-on collisions with other people who are also doing it on a public street.

82
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:36,839
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm yep, that's that's how I do.

83
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:41,523
Speaker 1: yep, but there are way more of them than because usually this time of year There's like a few people are doing it, but I think it's just.

84
00:05:41,543 --> 00:05:45,379
Speaker 1: people are getting stir-crazy They're going outside They're trying things they've never tried before.

85
00:05:45,681 --> 00:05:56,167
Speaker 1: my only advice to you if you live in New York And you were listening to this and you've never biked before Get on a city bike and practice like on an empty street before you go to the really crowded bike path like.

86
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:58,192
Speaker 1: that's all I ask Mean.

87
00:05:58,212 --> 00:06:00,139
Speaker 0: you know it's just the same thing we always talk about.

88
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:10,233
Speaker 0: is this people who you know actually You know do things and care about doing them well and want to learn right and try hard and pay attention Right.

89
00:06:10,695 --> 00:06:12,422
Speaker 0: and then there's people who don't care.

90
00:06:12,442 --> 00:06:14,169
Speaker 0: They're just like I'm riding a bike.

91
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,220
Speaker 0: well You know you can go faster if you learn how to use the gears.

92
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,110
Speaker 0: I don't want to learn anything right.

93
00:06:18,731 --> 00:06:19,634
Speaker 1: They're wobbling around.

94
00:06:19,654 --> 00:06:20,598
Speaker 0: they don't think it's a problem.

95
00:06:20,618 --> 00:06:22,545
Speaker 0: They don't care about improving right.

96
00:06:22,645 --> 00:06:23,729
Speaker 0: they've done all they want to do.

97
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:28,730
Speaker 0: Those are the two attitudes all right, and you know that attitude is the bad attitude.

98
00:06:29,284 --> 00:06:34,468
Speaker 1: Yep And that is that is actually a big part of where geek nights came from and why we do the show is us being

99
00:06:34,549 --> 00:06:45,075
Speaker 0: and every Everything I do even if it's not something I care too much about I'm always looking to do it better learn more about it Right try to improve efficiency quality Skill everything.

100
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:46,101
Speaker 1: how's that hadoken coming?

101
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:47,529
Speaker 0: I?

102
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,448
Speaker 0: mean I learned.

103
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:50,605
Speaker 0: So.

104
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,606
Speaker 1: Anyway So one news Scott's done more research on this than I have.

105
00:06:56,887 --> 00:07:03,474
Speaker 1: I wasn't aware That this was a thing until recently because I just I haven't been paying attention to tech news And it's rare.

106
00:07:03,755 --> 00:07:07,528
Speaker 1: there is tech news that actually matters to any pipeline.

107
00:07:07,688 --> 00:07:08,030
Speaker 1: I own.

108
00:07:08,994 --> 00:07:15,419
Speaker 0: So the deal is this is technology that's been around for a long time Yeah called SMR shingled magnetic recording.

109
00:07:15,881 --> 00:07:18,489
Speaker 0: that happens inside of old-school.

110
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:20,073
Speaker 0: I mean They're not.

111
00:07:20,153 --> 00:07:23,970
Speaker 0: it's weird that you call them old-school because everyone uses SSDs for everything nowadays.

112
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:28,669
Speaker 0: Yeah, magnetic drives still have a place because SSD capacity is not that big.

113
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:34,700
Speaker 1: yeah There's a reason why I have to one terabyte SSDs And then I also have to five terabyte magnetic disks.

114
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:42,190
Speaker 0: and Mike right so the magnetic disks have a technology in them So that they can have a technology them called SMR shingled magnetic recording.

115
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:48,735
Speaker 0: And it's called shingled because basically what happens is a lot like the shingles on the roof of a house Structurally right.

116
00:07:49,238 --> 00:07:52,170
Speaker 0: so the read the the inside of the hard drive.

117
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:57,452
Speaker 0: You know you're spinning the platters And you have these heads that move back and forth and read and write The.

118
00:07:57,973 --> 00:08:08,802
Speaker 0: just because of the way things are the physical size of the head that only does reading can be made Physically very small so you can read from a very tiny area.

119
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:09,243
Speaker 0: right.

120
00:08:10,126 --> 00:08:15,190
Speaker 0: the head that does writing Has to be larger just because it has more parts or it's bigger.

121
00:08:15,271 --> 00:08:17,350
Speaker 0: I don't understand why it just has to be right.

122
00:08:18,511 --> 00:08:21,019
Speaker 0: So the result is that you could actually write.

123
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:24,229
Speaker 0: Let's say you write a one with with the right head, right?

124
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,093
Speaker 0: You've actually.

125
00:08:26,113 --> 00:08:34,943
Speaker 0: what you've done is you've actually written two ones on top of each other Right and the read head could read from like only part of that area right.

126
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:47,856
Speaker 0: so if you're a clever and you wrote the you took the right head and you wrote down two ones at once and Then even though the right head is big you could just move it Less than its size.

127
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:51,669
Speaker 0: the motor that moves it is just as precise as the motor that moves the read head.

128
00:08:52,253 --> 00:09:00,492
Speaker 1: This is the kind of crap that like old PC games would put copy protection on discs by writing stuff in a weird way to a floppy Right.

129
00:09:00,512 --> 00:09:04,583
Speaker 0: so you could move the right head halfway up and then write a zero.

130
00:09:04,884 --> 00:09:12,706
Speaker 0: so now in that spot where they used to be Two ones on top of each other is now a zero and then a one under it like shingles right.

131
00:09:13,047 --> 00:09:19,090
Speaker 0: so you move the right Head up you know half ways each time and you can actually get increased.

132
00:09:19,451 --> 00:09:21,981
Speaker 0: You know not it's not as precise as that.

133
00:09:22,002 --> 00:09:25,613
Speaker 0: you couldn't get you know double your density But you.

134
00:09:25,914 --> 00:09:30,290
Speaker 0: but you can get a large increase in storage capacity by using this technology.

135
00:09:30,853 --> 00:09:33,406
Speaker 0: And it happens completely internal to the drive.

136
00:09:33,446 --> 00:09:38,066
Speaker 0: so your computer Doesn't necessarily know about it or know or have to care about it that much.

137
00:09:38,488 --> 00:09:39,733
Speaker 0: the hard drive Just does it.

138
00:09:40,114 --> 00:09:42,524
Speaker 0: it reports that it has larger capacity.

139
00:09:43,026 --> 00:09:57,862
Speaker 0: it uses caching You know technologies so that even though Writing is taking a longer amount of time to write your computer might not notice if you're not trying to write or read too much Because of caches and various things going on.

140
00:09:58,284 --> 00:09:59,008
Speaker 0: and it kind of works.

141
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:02,017
Speaker 0: Now the obvious the problem.

142
00:10:02,037 --> 00:10:04,003
Speaker 1: like we're not saying this technology is bad.

143
00:10:04,063 --> 00:10:18,057
Speaker 1: the problem is that a Lot of hard drives are using this and not telling you and the way hard drive statistics tend to be reported Could easily hide Potentially catastrophic performance problems from you.

144
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,942
Speaker 0: well it doesn't hide it actually.

145
00:10:19,982 --> 00:10:22,348
Speaker 0: it just you you your hard drive just doesn't work right.

146
00:10:22,369 --> 00:10:22,870
Speaker 0: so what?

147
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,889
Speaker 0: What happens is back in the day?

148
00:10:25,251 --> 00:10:34,254
Speaker 0: You know when they first introduced this technology you would go to buy hard drives and the hard drives had different labels on them like different branding In term.

149
00:10:34,295 --> 00:10:40,310
Speaker 0: so they would be like Western Digital red black whatever and they were supposed to indicate different tiers of performance.

150
00:10:41,591 --> 00:10:43,678
Speaker 0: And there would be like NAS hard drives and the.

151
00:10:43,979 --> 00:10:48,656
Speaker 0: the SMR was used in what were usually labeled as like Archival drives.

152
00:10:48,736 --> 00:10:49,138
Speaker 0: right like.

153
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,570
Speaker 0: buy these cheap large drives.

154
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,358
Speaker 0: They're for archival.

155
00:10:53,378 --> 00:10:55,870
Speaker 0: they're not for like high read/write applications.

156
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,954
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're like real.

157
00:10:56,974 --> 00:10:58,359
Speaker 0: the drive up read a lot.

158
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,623
Speaker 1: Maybe but you're not writing right.

159
00:10:59,643 --> 00:11:00,306
Speaker 1: They're not suddenly.

160
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,490
Speaker 0: They're not unreliable.

161
00:11:01,836 --> 00:11:07,384
Speaker 0: They're Danny right It's just you use this to fill up a data and then not access it too often.

162
00:11:07,645 --> 00:11:09,250
Speaker 0: right and you could save money that way.

163
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:26,343
Speaker 0: And that's how they were marketed, but more recently they've been putting this technology into drives with different branding Like Western some Western Digital Reds even one model of Western Digital black has it Which is supposed to be like one of the higher performance models.

164
00:11:26,544 --> 00:11:32,463
Speaker 1: actually I have to go check What because I have two blacks in my current computer that I bought a long time ago.

165
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,647
Speaker 1: I got a check.

166
00:11:33,707 --> 00:11:38,687
Speaker 0: they might be SMRs right, but the point is is that you might know their SMR.

167
00:11:38,707 --> 00:11:44,467
Speaker 0: because Number one some people are reporting like people are weirdos using ZFS.

168
00:11:44,507 --> 00:11:50,988
Speaker 0: Yeah Are like hey my ZFS keeps kicking this drive out because it's it's timing out.

169
00:11:51,088 --> 00:11:53,666
Speaker 0: unlike rights It kicks it out of the cluster all right.

170
00:11:54,813 --> 00:12:03,950
Speaker 0: Other people are like they have drives in their NAS crash And then they replace them and the NAS refuses to use the SMR drive as a replacement.

171
00:12:04,051 --> 00:12:04,855
Speaker 0: It's like no that one's.

172
00:12:04,976 --> 00:12:06,022
Speaker 0: it's that drive is bad.

173
00:12:06,062 --> 00:12:08,276
Speaker 0: I'm not yeah, I'm not repair I'm not repairing.

174
00:12:08,377 --> 00:12:11,837
Speaker 1: on to that like I tried to write to it And it wasn't as performant as I expected.

175
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:13,483
Speaker 1: something's wrong with it right right.

176
00:12:13,503 --> 00:12:14,206
Speaker 0: It's like the.

177
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:20,970
Speaker 0: because so You might not you know there are ways to tell like maybe a few ways to tell if the drive is SMR.

178
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:27,676
Speaker 0: But you know now basically because this is like a fiasco all the hard drive manufacturers I've sort of spill.

179
00:12:27,737 --> 00:12:30,268
Speaker 0: I've you know come clean and be like okay these drives have them.

180
00:12:30,308 --> 00:12:31,132
Speaker 0: these drives Don't?

181
00:12:31,172 --> 00:12:31,313
Speaker 0: right?

182
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:36,898
Speaker 1: yeah, but the reason I'm mad about it like the real problem Is that the hard drive companies were really like.

183
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:41,330
Speaker 1: they knew that if they talked about this technology people would avoid those drives.

184
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:49,029
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, right, so they say yeah The only people who are buying individual magnetic drives are people who know what they're buying.

185
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:56,110
Speaker 0: yep So look at nobody's buying individual magnetic hard drives in 2020. who isn't a nerd who knows about all the things on the label?

186
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,907
Speaker 1: Yep, so I don't have any customers issue these statements like all.

187
00:13:00,028 --> 00:13:00,410
Speaker 1: right.

188
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:04,019
Speaker 1: Here's some of the drives where we might be using this technology.

189
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,280
Speaker 0: right.

190
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:11,145
Speaker 0: Seagate statement was like these NAS drives these Fox Pro whatever's iron something's.

191
00:13:11,266 --> 00:13:14,016
Speaker 0: yeah these ones Definitely never have SMR.

192
00:13:14,116 --> 00:13:15,842
Speaker 0: They are the ones that aren't.

193
00:13:15,882 --> 00:13:18,450
Speaker 0: those might put these ones never have it.

194
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,662
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you know because it's like.

195
00:13:20,722 --> 00:13:22,090
Speaker 0: it's not a bad technology.

196
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,150
Speaker 0: It's just it crushes your performance.

197
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:38,379
Speaker 0: So if you're buying drives And you need lots of reading or writing like in your NAS that you're using a lot for example as opposed to your NAS That's asleep all day Then you need to know Right if using ZFS you need to know if you're.

198
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,730
Speaker 0: if you're NAS isn't going to accept the drive as a replacement.

199
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:45,650
Speaker 0: You need to know and not buy the wrong drive, so it's fine to have it out there.

200
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,643
Speaker 1: It's like okay product except this article the first article will link to.

201
00:13:49,684 --> 00:13:50,948
Speaker 1: it actually points out something.

202
00:13:51,389 --> 00:14:00,750
Speaker 1: this Technology does not actually let the manufacturers put more capacity in the drive so much as they're selling The same capacities.

203
00:14:01,454 --> 00:14:01,877
Speaker 1: They're just.

204
00:14:02,038 --> 00:14:03,730
Speaker 1: it may cost them less money to make them.

205
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:07,150
Speaker 1: They're saving themselves money, but they're not passing that on to us right?

206
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,378
Speaker 0: I thought that was interesting.

207
00:14:08,438 --> 00:14:20,290
Speaker 0: is that you know one that they listed like oh, yeah The drives that are like big like the 10 terabyte one like that one's you know like normal CMR Which is like you know classical magnetic recording right?

208
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,662
Speaker 0: They're like yeah the two terabyte one the cheapo model.

209
00:14:24,084 --> 00:14:26,115
Speaker 0: that one has SMR And I'm like wait a minute.

210
00:14:26,256 --> 00:14:32,730
Speaker 0: wouldn't the 10 terabyte one have like You know six terabytes worth of platters, and then use SMR to get up to ten?

211
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:37,649
Speaker 0: It's like no no one's gonna because someone who buys a 10 terabyte drive is gonna pay the money.

212
00:14:38,031 --> 00:14:42,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, so they went after the cheapo like the people are buying these one to four terabyte.

213
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:48,329
Speaker 0: You want to make that four terabyte the two terabyte four terabyte drive cheaper by using one or two three?

214
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,953
Speaker 0: Terabytes of platters.

215
00:14:50,013 --> 00:14:55,728
Speaker 0: take a platter out right increase the capacity drop the price and compete on that low end.

216
00:14:55,768 --> 00:14:58,817
Speaker 0: on the high end Right people are gonna a notice.

217
00:14:59,018 --> 00:14:59,961
Speaker 0: be care more.

218
00:15:00,382 --> 00:15:06,983
Speaker 0: see that performance problem will be Exacerbated when you have so much space on there right you know.

219
00:15:07,084 --> 00:15:11,080
Speaker 0: even because like you think someone's buying a 10 terabyte drive Right the first thing that you know gonna.

220
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,070
Speaker 0: Do is try to fill it up with 10 terabytes of data.

221
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:14,114
Speaker 0: Yep, that's gonna.

222
00:15:14,154 --> 00:15:18,190
Speaker 0: Take a long fucking ass time if it's got the shingle Emma, right?

223
00:15:20,412 --> 00:15:21,722
Speaker 0: So they would notice it immediately.

224
00:15:21,742 --> 00:15:22,850
Speaker 1: yeah, so this is like.

225
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:24,762
Speaker 1: This is a scandal like.

226
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:25,729
Speaker 1: this is not just like.

227
00:15:25,749 --> 00:15:27,516
Speaker 1: oh Here's the technology people didn't understand.

228
00:15:27,556 --> 00:15:27,677
Speaker 1: like.

229
00:15:27,777 --> 00:15:31,030
Speaker 0: I consider this scandal among people who still care about magnetic drives.

230
00:15:31,111 --> 00:15:41,379
Speaker 0: I imagine most listeners out there You know who aren't doing some sort of videos big storage application only have SSDs these days and don't give a crap though.

231
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,350
Speaker 1: I still run into a lot of people who only have spinning disks.

232
00:15:45,032 --> 00:15:45,673
Speaker 0: That's strange.

233
00:15:45,693 --> 00:15:48,160
Speaker 0: if you only have spinning disks you can at least buy.

234
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:53,558
Speaker 0: if not if you don't have any m2 slots in your computer Yeah, you can buy like I see.

235
00:15:54,020 --> 00:16:02,308
Speaker 0: yeah a two and a half inch s ATA SSD And that those are way cheap these days because people like sort of don't care too much about those anymore.

236
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:05,790
Speaker 1: Yep You can get like a terabyte for not that much money.

237
00:16:06,251 --> 00:16:12,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can get those way cheap these days especially the slower models and those will still be like lightning fast change like change your life.

238
00:16:13,011 --> 00:16:21,602
Speaker 0: Yeah, like better than any other upgrade you can do to your PC is putting with putting your operating system And your most used applications onto an SSD instead of a magnetic.

239
00:16:21,702 --> 00:16:23,689
Speaker 1: I think the people most likely to be burned by this.

240
00:16:23,729 --> 00:16:25,475
Speaker 1: I think There's two very specific classes of people.

241
00:16:25,515 --> 00:16:38,783
Speaker 1: class number one people who buy a low-end NAS like a to drive NAS Because they're smart and they like they're upgrading their game, but that's like they buy this NAS They just look for like what are some cheap for terabyte hard drives to stick in this thing?

242
00:16:39,084 --> 00:16:40,910
Speaker 1: BAM SMR the NAS works like shit.

243
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,490
Speaker 1: They'll never know why right?

244
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:50,130
Speaker 0: I think the people who get burned are the people who are say who have lots of storage needs like Photo-video experts who aren't also computer experts, right?

245
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:56,410
Speaker 0: Like there's a lot of people who are like camera people and they have NASA's right, but they don't know too much about computer.

246
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:01,610
Speaker 1: They mostly just like well, those are the kind of people who are buying like drobos instead of buying like a real NAS.

247
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,333
Speaker 1: That's way better.

248
00:17:02,353 --> 00:17:06,790
Speaker 0: exactly exactly that kind of person right who's got like a Mac and a drobo connected to it or something.

249
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:12,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, that person might got like 10 drives in there of 10 different sizes and you just try it in this hard drive work.

250
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:17,828
Speaker 1: Yeah, so my advice to you is if you understand what we just talked about make your own decisions.

251
00:17:17,848 --> 00:17:19,503
Speaker 1: like SMR It probably has a use.

252
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:27,388
Speaker 0: just if next time you buy magnetic disks do some research to see if they have it or not and if you need it think About your application and whether it's gonna hurt you or not.

253
00:17:27,731 --> 00:17:33,250
Speaker 0: And if you have any existing magnetic disks, just look up the model to make sure whether it has SMR or not.

254
00:17:34,372 --> 00:17:35,783
Speaker 0: And you know, it's like I could look up.

255
00:17:35,884 --> 00:17:41,010
Speaker 0: the only magnetic disks I really use like the ones in my NAS are the most recently purchased ones like they're working.

256
00:17:41,232 --> 00:17:41,675
Speaker 0: So it's like.

257
00:17:41,715 --> 00:17:43,427
Speaker 0: I guess if they have it, it's not a big deal.

258
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:58,660
Speaker 1: Yep I guess I just can't put my hands down when I'm not like when no one's accessing it Exactly, but I think the real thing is if you don't understand any of what we talked about Just never get an SMR drive unless it is dirt cheap.

259
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:12,323
Speaker 0: because and if you don't understand we talked about what you don't buy magnetic disks You probably don't need yeah But like it's 2020 the SMR drive versus the non SMR drive The price difference is not enough to even like like.

260
00:18:12,363 --> 00:18:14,229
Speaker 1: that is not a compromise that is worth doing.

261
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,560
Speaker 1: you Just get a worse drive and you don't save a material amount of money.

262
00:18:18,323 --> 00:18:19,787
Speaker 0: The hard drive manufacturer says yeah.

263
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:21,721
Speaker 1: Yeah Boss saves money.

264
00:18:21,762 --> 00:18:26,989
Speaker 0: You don't save money All right, so, uh, I just want to talk briefly geek bite about the new.

265
00:18:27,612 --> 00:18:31,345
Speaker 0: What is the actual name of this product that iPad magic keyboard or something?

266
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:32,910
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, you got that thing.

267
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:33,553
Speaker 1: I haven't seen it.

268
00:18:34,397 --> 00:18:37,010
Speaker 0: It's called magic keyboard for iPad Pro, right?

269
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:45,250
Speaker 0: So in the most recent iOS more recent iOS updates They they improved the support for pointing devices like mice and touch pads, right?

270
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:48,109
Speaker 0: So presumably you could use like a Bluetooth mouse or something, right?

271
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:54,364
Speaker 0: So when I got the iPad Pro Originally, you know, I wanted to get a hundred bucks.

272
00:18:55,128 --> 00:18:59,644
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I could buy a laptop for 300 bucks and get change.

273
00:18:59,664 --> 00:19:00,970
Speaker 0: You sure could.

274
00:19:02,423 --> 00:19:05,573
Speaker 0: So The mat.

275
00:19:05,593 --> 00:19:22,168
Speaker 0: so when I bought the iPad Pro the second because I had the original iPad Pro and then I switched to the newer one after that and The I bought a the original one that I had I had like a separate Bluetooth keyboard that I got.

276
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:22,750
Speaker 0: that was all cheap.

277
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:24,405
Speaker 0: Oh that I would put next to it.

278
00:19:25,852 --> 00:19:27,116
Speaker 0: But that didn't work out too.

279
00:19:27,156 --> 00:19:34,167
Speaker 0: Well, because it was really annoying to carry around a Bluetooth keyboard everywhere And like you wouldn't use it when it was a separate thing too often.

280
00:19:34,287 --> 00:19:39,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, right That's why I still have a super thin traditional laptop that just rolls open and has a keyboard.

281
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:50,184
Speaker 0: So when I got the next iPad Pro, I bought the the keyboard that Apple made that goes with it the smart keyboard folio I think they call it which was actually okay.

282
00:19:50,204 --> 00:19:51,330
Speaker 0: Like it wasn't great.

283
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:55,730
Speaker 0: It was like this, you know, the keyboard was kind of like these flat Mac keys, right?

284
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:04,550
Speaker 0: But it it worked and it was also a cover for the iPad and you could fold it back And hold your iPad like a normal iPad and you know, it was cool.

285
00:20:05,155 --> 00:20:18,409
Speaker 0: the problem with it is that it was Fragile and it broke and I found a thread of people on the Apple support who had it break in the exact same way And basically when I connect it it says yeah unsupported accessory like it's an Apple made

286
00:20:18,449 --> 00:20:18,669
Speaker 1: product

287
00:20:19,592 --> 00:20:24,749
Speaker 0: And it broke after Apple care expired right so I couldn't do anything about it.

288
00:20:26,471 --> 00:20:31,670
Speaker 0: So it became just like it became a keyboard a cover with a keyboard that occasionally worked.

289
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,038
Speaker 0: So There are these third-party keyboards you can get.

290
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:39,809
Speaker 0: that are also cases like Logitech make some and whatnot.

291
00:20:40,911 --> 00:20:43,078
Speaker 0: But I've tried those in stores and like.

292
00:20:43,138 --> 00:20:44,804
Speaker 0: they're like kind of meh, right?

293
00:20:44,824 --> 00:20:46,750
Speaker 0: They're cheaper, but they're meh, right?

294
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:56,795
Speaker 0: They're like big and chunky and I kind of defeat the purpose like you might as you're right if you're getting one of those You might as well buy a laptop because even though they're cheaper They're not my laptop.

295
00:20:56,875 --> 00:21:01,390
Speaker 1: My actual laptop is thinner than your iPad Pro plus this keyboard.

296
00:21:02,691 --> 00:21:03,953
Speaker 0: I don't know about that.

297
00:21:03,973 --> 00:21:04,534
Speaker 0: They're real.

298
00:21:04,574 --> 00:21:07,018
Speaker 0: laptop is almost definitely slower than the iPad.

299
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:11,250
Speaker 0: the iPad is People don't realize because it's hard to directly.

300
00:21:12,133 --> 00:21:13,659
Speaker 0: It's hard to directly compare.

301
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:17,712
Speaker 0: I think people are sleeping on this including Apple I think is sleeping on this.

302
00:21:18,353 --> 00:21:25,888
Speaker 0: is that the CPUs that Apple is making the arm ones for the iOS devices are Insanely powerful.

303
00:21:25,989 --> 00:21:34,440
Speaker 0: people don't realize it Like be an iPhone 7 or like, you know iPhone 8 is like faster than almost every Android phone, right?

304
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're already on like iPhone 11 right with even newer CPUs Right.

305
00:21:39,283 --> 00:21:47,834
Speaker 0: and the iPad Pro is like I think it might be like as fast as like super high-end Microsoft Surface Pro if not faster, right?

306
00:21:47,914 --> 00:21:56,514
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're just like ridiculous I saw of similar size has a pretty fast i7 in it Yeah, but has fans and it blows right.

307
00:21:56,574 --> 00:22:07,813
Speaker 1: now if you it did Even if you push a fan that has only ever made noise once and the time it made noise was when as a test I Turned I tried to play overwatch on the laptop with all the settings turned up.

308
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:09,720
Speaker 0: point is iPad pros really strong?

309
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,447
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, you're paying up your.

310
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:14,660
Speaker 1: it's a real computer just without a real operating system, right?

311
00:22:14,981 --> 00:22:25,468
Speaker 0: The price of the iPad Pro actually can you know considering what it does is actually sort of not as overpriced as other Apple products Like this keyboard which is ridiculously overpriced my laptop.

312
00:22:25,528 --> 00:22:29,238
Speaker 1: I keep talking about cost over $2,000 like right.

313
00:22:29,258 --> 00:22:29,739
Speaker 1: It's not like.

314
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:29,979
Speaker 1: yeah.

315
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,488
Speaker 0: So the keyboard is ridiculously overpriced.

316
00:22:33,729 --> 00:22:35,835
Speaker 0: don't get it unless you have like money to set on fire.

317
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:37,400
Speaker 0: because Wow, is it overpriced?

318
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,727
Speaker 1: Yeah, three hundred dollars.

319
00:22:39,948 --> 00:22:51,519
Speaker 0: You've spent on a keyboard for a tablet right exactly, but It's pretty nice like the actual like in terms of like a keyboard with the flat chiclet keys.

320
00:22:52,183 --> 00:22:58,166
Speaker 0: It might be like the best keyboard of not mechanical keys That have had.

321
00:22:58,547 --> 00:23:01,460
Speaker 0: it just doesn't have any F keys, but I guess in an iPad you don't need those.

322
00:23:01,821 --> 00:23:06,353
Speaker 1: Oh, I also would need those on a laptop because I use F keys a lot.

323
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:07,216
Speaker 0: Yeah.

324
00:23:07,236 --> 00:23:08,800
Speaker 0: Well, I pet iOS doesn't really need them.

325
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,415
Speaker 0: Yeah, what does it do on iOS?

326
00:23:10,435 --> 00:23:13,620
Speaker 0: Yeah I guess if it's a Mac you need them, right?

327
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,884
Speaker 0: But iOS doesn't need F keys.

328
00:23:15,486 --> 00:23:19,760
Speaker 0: also the trackpad the mad trackpad that's incorporated into the bottom of the keyboard.

329
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,522
Speaker 0: Was that part good?

330
00:23:20,543 --> 00:23:22,308
Speaker 1: because I would pay $300 for that to be good.

331
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:26,563
Speaker 0: that is better than any trackpad on any laptop I've ever.

332
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:29,780
Speaker 1: the best trackpad I've ever touched on a lap.

333
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:37,940
Speaker 0: It's even better than like the I used to have the Apple Separate trackpad when I had a Mac at a job and this is better than that.

334
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:41,491
Speaker 1: The only show host I've ever liked and it was actually crazy good.

335
00:23:41,772 --> 00:23:45,784
Speaker 1: the old Fujitsu lifebooks had this Amazing trackpad.

336
00:23:46,105 --> 00:23:47,771
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that's this is even better than that.

337
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:48,092
Speaker 1: Yeah.

338
00:23:48,152 --> 00:23:48,855
Speaker 1: Wow, really?

339
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:50,280
Speaker 0: I'd if you it's so good.

340
00:23:50,482 --> 00:23:55,020
Speaker 1: All right, as soon as soon as quarantines over enough I want to touch that trackpad because it's so nice.

341
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:59,758
Speaker 1: I have never found a trackpad that even came close to that for jitsu lifebook trackpad, you know, it's.

342
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:00,360
Speaker 0: it's ridiculous.

343
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:04,919
Speaker 1: I don't imagine someone spent like a decade just designing the perfect trackpad at for jitsu.

344
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:13,908
Speaker 0: Yeah So the only the other than the obscene cost right which you shouldn't spend unless you have obscene Extra money.

345
00:24:13,968 --> 00:24:25,360
Speaker 0: or you really need a keyboard on your iPad As head as a USB C port on it Which is cool because you can now get to USB C ports on your iPad Pro one for charging one for connecting stuff.

346
00:24:26,042 --> 00:24:30,460
Speaker 0: But the one that's the one that's on the keyboard can pretty much only be used for charging.

347
00:24:30,581 --> 00:24:43,122
Speaker 0: so if you want to say connect some devices maybe like a you know HDMI output thing you still need half the main one that one has to go on the iPad and the charging has to go on the Keyboard.

348
00:24:43,162 --> 00:24:43,806
Speaker 1: Well, it makes sense.

349
00:24:43,866 --> 00:24:46,800
Speaker 1: It's not like the keyboard has a USB C connection to the tablet.

350
00:24:47,463 --> 00:24:48,127
Speaker 0: Right, exactly.

351
00:24:48,428 --> 00:24:50,560
Speaker 0: The other thing is it's pretty cool to hinge.

352
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:55,200
Speaker 0: It's like the iPad sort of floats in the air and a magical Apple way.

353
00:24:55,503 --> 00:25:00,094
Speaker 1: I'm looking at it on the stream right now Which is as much as I think this thing is overpriced.

354
00:25:00,134 --> 00:25:04,430
Speaker 0: that looks pretty cool Right, and it actually completely works and is complete here.

355
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:05,996
Speaker 0: I'm holding it up on the YouTube, right?

356
00:25:06,196 --> 00:25:09,909
Speaker 0: Yeah, it totally works Right, it's not some right.

357
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:16,580
Speaker 0: it's completely legit that that part of it is completely Though that whole contraption is definitely thicker than my laptop.

358
00:25:17,822 --> 00:25:19,006
Speaker 0: This is let me get my ruler.

359
00:25:19,026 --> 00:25:21,878
Speaker 1: I don't have my laptop within length after the show.

360
00:25:21,898 --> 00:25:22,340
Speaker 1: Let's measure.

361
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:26,907
Speaker 0: Okay, my ruler says The whole thing.

362
00:25:26,927 --> 00:25:28,795
Speaker 1: I'm gonna write this down.

363
00:25:28,856 --> 00:25:31,147
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go measure mine All right.

364
00:25:31,167 --> 00:25:35,386
Speaker 0: Let me flip flat here And get a piece of paper.

365
00:25:35,747 --> 00:25:36,972
Speaker 1: this is very important science.

366
00:25:37,012 --> 00:25:38,357
Speaker 1: this is primary journalism.

367
00:25:38,397 --> 00:25:39,160
Speaker 1: geek nights is doing.

368
00:25:40,301 --> 00:25:44,655
Speaker 0: It's basically like it's a centimeter, but you have to add that little beginning.

369
00:25:44,735 --> 00:25:46,200
Speaker 0: run on the ruler.

370
00:25:46,862 --> 00:25:50,876
Speaker 0: Okay, so it's a. it's a centimeter plus the space on the ruler before the zero.

371
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:52,180
Speaker 1: Okay, so about a centimeter.

372
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:57,920
Speaker 0: So like let one and one between one and one and a half centimeters total the keyboard and the iPad Pro.

373
00:25:58,181 --> 00:25:58,943
Speaker 1: I will post the.

374
00:25:58,964 --> 00:26:05,932
Speaker 1: I will measure my laptop closed without any shenanigans and post that in the forum And we'll see because if my laptop is thinner than that.

375
00:26:06,234 --> 00:26:07,018
Speaker 1: That's just really funny.

376
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:11,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, the keyboard also adds a lot of weight to the fit to the iPad.

377
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:15,158
Speaker 1: Well making it real you spend $300 to just turn it into a laptop.

378
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:24,448
Speaker 0: basically That's true because the other negative about it that I didn't realize is that you know when you use an iPad you kind of want To rotate horizontal vertical.

379
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:27,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know you also get your magic pencil going on right?

380
00:26:28,783 --> 00:26:30,200
Speaker 0: This thing doesn't rotate.

381
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:35,344
Speaker 0: You can't flip the keyboard to the back like you can With the folio.

382
00:26:35,444 --> 00:26:36,729
Speaker 0: it pretty much just turns that.

383
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:45,900
Speaker 0: so basically if you want to on laptop you have to take the iPad out of The case noted okay you take the iPad out and now it's an iPad and then you put it back in and it's a laptop.

384
00:26:46,121 --> 00:26:47,204
Speaker 0: so it's sort of like.

385
00:26:47,225 --> 00:26:55,139
Speaker 0: it's sort of like the the surface Pro where the Monitor where the top comes out and the keyboard stays behind.

386
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:56,648
Speaker 0: It's a lot.

387
00:26:56,689 --> 00:27:02,719
Speaker 0: it's a lot like that situation But yeah way overpriced.

388
00:27:05,086 --> 00:27:06,115
Speaker 0: The problem is is like.

389
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:08,585
Speaker 0: It's like for what it is.

390
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:10,890
Speaker 0: It's overpriced, but it's like.

391
00:27:11,071 --> 00:27:14,780
Speaker 0: There's no amount of money that you can spend on a other product.

392
00:27:14,901 --> 00:27:20,959
Speaker 0: That is it's like every other keyboard You can get is not as is garbage much I want to make fun of you for buying this.

393
00:27:21,381 --> 00:27:26,900
Speaker 1: That is kind of our philosophy of our life of by the cheapest thing or by the best thing never go in the middle.

394
00:27:27,221 --> 00:27:30,980
Speaker 1: But sometimes the best thing is overpriced, but there is no alternative.

395
00:27:31,861 --> 00:27:33,648
Speaker 0: Except that's exactly the situation here.

396
00:27:33,668 --> 00:27:34,511
Speaker 0: is Apple has you.

397
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:36,660
Speaker 0: I think Apple knows they have you over a barrel.

398
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,343
Speaker 0: They're like man.

399
00:27:37,363 --> 00:27:40,114
Speaker 0: No one's really making anything in this category.

400
00:27:40,135 --> 00:27:40,476
Speaker 0: That's any.

401
00:27:40,536 --> 00:27:41,380
Speaker 0: it's worth a shit.

402
00:27:41,741 --> 00:27:43,550
Speaker 0: We can charge a fortune for ours.

403
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,293
Speaker 0: It's like.

404
00:27:44,313 --> 00:27:44,735
Speaker 0: What are you gonna?

405
00:27:44,755 --> 00:27:45,740
Speaker 0: Do buy something else?

406
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,460
Speaker 0: I Buy ours for way too much money or else go with some trash, right?

407
00:27:52,301 --> 00:28:04,120
Speaker 0: It's like if you went to the store, and you were buying literal apples to eat right and it's like oh Yeah, there's a whole barrel full of rotten apples that are a penny each and there's one normal Apple.

408
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,186
Speaker 0: It's like well What's a normal Apple worth 50 cent?

409
00:28:06,347 --> 00:28:10,000
Speaker 0: right a dollar maybe if you're you know in a you know if it's out of season?

410
00:28:10,141 --> 00:28:11,188
Speaker 0: And it's really tasty.

411
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:13,302
Speaker 0: it's like and they're charging $100.

412
00:28:13,302 --> 00:28:14,029
Speaker 0: It's like I paint $100 to one Apple.

413
00:28:16,282 --> 00:28:17,286
Speaker 1: All the other ones are rotten.

414
00:28:17,307 --> 00:28:17,949
Speaker 0: What are you gonna?

415
00:28:17,969 --> 00:28:18,371
Speaker 0: Do not eat?

416
00:28:18,411 --> 00:28:20,380
Speaker 1: I think the better analogy is airport pricing.

417
00:28:20,601 --> 00:28:24,252
Speaker 1: That's what that thing costs when you're in the airport like that.

418
00:28:24,272 --> 00:28:25,757
Speaker 1: you want it, and you're in the airport.

419
00:28:25,857 --> 00:28:26,239
Speaker 0: That's it.

420
00:28:27,001 --> 00:28:38,399
Speaker 0: But I am excited because something I've been asking for for 13 years Which is the ability to make iOS apps on an iOS device with Xcode for iOS.

421
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:42,631
Speaker 0: Right every computer that has a keyboard.

422
00:28:42,671 --> 00:28:44,960
Speaker 0: pretty much you can make apps for it on the computer.

423
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,720
Speaker 0: You can make a Windows app on a Windows computer, huh, right you can make an OS X app on a Mac, right?

424
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,748
Speaker 0: Every computer ever has been able to program.

425
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:57,100
Speaker 0: almost every computer ever has had the ability to make apps for itself.

426
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,364
Speaker 0: Yep, that's kind of west is.

427
00:28:58,645 --> 00:29:03,660
Speaker 1: that's one of those like very important concepts that if we ever lose that capability we've broken society.

428
00:29:04,905 --> 00:29:11,077
Speaker 0: right iOS Doesn't have this, but the rumor is there is an Xcode for iOS.

429
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:11,940
Speaker 0: that might be a coming.

430
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:13,544
Speaker 0: We'll see.

431
00:29:13,644 --> 00:29:20,102
Speaker 0: so if if that happens then this keyboard is totally worth $350.

432
00:29:20,102 --> 00:29:21,388
Speaker 0: If not then it might not be.

433
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:30,623
Speaker 1: maybe wait on that, but anyway Things of the day, so I'll do mine first.

434
00:29:30,663 --> 00:29:32,270
Speaker 1: cuz it's a I found a channel.

435
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:33,679
Speaker 1: I don't think I've linked to that.

436
00:29:34,444 --> 00:29:35,450
Speaker 1: it's one of those things that I want.

437
00:29:36,652 --> 00:29:45,304
Speaker 1: It's this real engineering channel, but this video is a 20-minute long Detailed explanation of how fucking insane the sr-71 blackbird was.

438
00:29:45,926 --> 00:29:47,310
Speaker 0: we all know how insane it was.

439
00:29:47,611 --> 00:29:50,990
Speaker 0: How much more can we learn about how insane it was this one actually?

440
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,835
Speaker 1: Explains a lot more like it sort of.

441
00:29:52,855 --> 00:29:55,624
Speaker 1: it provides a lot of the foundation like ramjets.

442
00:29:55,644 --> 00:30:02,788
Speaker 1: a lot of people know the word ramjet but don't really understand what a ramjet is and They only partially understand what it is.

443
00:30:03,771 --> 00:30:05,509
Speaker 1: Well you might want to watch this video.

444
00:30:06,316 --> 00:30:08,573
Speaker 0: I don't need to know that what it is I just need to.

445
00:30:08,653 --> 00:30:12,029
Speaker 0: I just know that the blackbird had them and that's part of what made it all well.

446
00:30:12,271 --> 00:30:14,422
Speaker 0: So the blackbird sides the way that it looks so cool.

447
00:30:14,482 --> 00:30:19,890
Speaker 1: if the blackbird just had ramjets It would never be able to take off because ramjets don't work unless you're already going very fast.

448
00:30:21,011 --> 00:30:25,930
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm right the whole point of a ramjet is I'm still I'm super oversimplifying.

449
00:30:26,832 --> 00:30:29,230
Speaker 1: The air intake is fast enough to self compress.

450
00:30:30,452 --> 00:30:31,603
Speaker 0: Okay, okay going so fast.

451
00:30:32,356 --> 00:30:39,650
Speaker 1: Yeah They can't even start running or provide any thrust unless you start them after you're already going extremely fast.

452
00:30:39,931 --> 00:30:42,704
Speaker 0: You know it's like a lot of it's like F Formula One cars, right?

453
00:30:42,744 --> 00:30:44,050
Speaker 0: It's like they have to heat them up, right?

454
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,047
Speaker 0: It's like the brakes don't work until they're hot.

455
00:30:46,872 --> 00:30:55,708
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then you don't want to go too hot because they'll melt like a rail You can't stop gets launched with a like regular propellant to get it fast enough for the ramjet to kick in.

456
00:30:56,531 --> 00:31:04,193
Speaker 1: Right, you know, but this video is just a really good like it's the right depth like it's just interesting that very fast machines Can't go slow.

457
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:05,617
Speaker 0: Yeah, I only go fast.

458
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,262
Speaker 1: Yeah, I do like.

459
00:31:07,342 --> 00:31:09,870
Speaker 1: I like the videos in this genre.

460
00:31:10,051 --> 00:31:17,310
Speaker 1: I actually like ones that are much more in depth Like I like them to be deeper than I can understand to force me to do research and engage.

461
00:31:17,753 --> 00:31:20,570
Speaker 1: But what I appreciate about this video and what's my thing of the day?

462
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:36,770
Speaker 1: It's at a really good level of depth for most people to like really internalize how fucking insane the SR 71 Blackbird was without just being a facile two-minute check out this thing and without being a like hour-long nonsense fest that only me and two other people care about.

463
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,964
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Somebody got all right.

464
00:31:40,653 --> 00:31:41,422
Speaker 0: So thing of the day.

465
00:31:41,503 --> 00:31:48,562
Speaker 0: so way back I think I did a thing of the day or a news of some guy on YouTube Explaining, you know, like when Docker was more of a thing.

466
00:31:48,803 --> 00:31:52,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think it still is the thing I got a lot of Docker infrastructure.

467
00:31:53,672 --> 00:32:00,442
Speaker 0: It's not it's less of a thing for me these days, but cuz it's still out there And I learned how it actually works.

468
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:09,010
Speaker 0: right the Linux kernel has these API's for Cgroups and other various things that allow you to make a container without making an actual virtual machine, right?

469
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:11,801
Speaker 0: You basically say hey all these processes are in this C group.

470
00:32:12,102 --> 00:32:13,910
Speaker 0: They only get this much RAM between them.

471
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:16,040
Speaker 0: They can only have these permissions, right?

472
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,928
Speaker 0: They're sort of isolated over there.

473
00:32:18,852 --> 00:32:24,169
Speaker 0: It's because Linux kernel added these API's and a guy I found a video of a guy explaining it and it was.

474
00:32:24,249 --> 00:32:25,901
Speaker 0: I was Like, oh, that's how it fucking works.

475
00:32:25,941 --> 00:32:27,090
Speaker 0: Why didn't you explain that Docker?

476
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:27,891
Speaker 0: Right.

477
00:32:27,931 --> 00:32:30,310
Speaker 0: Docker is just a wrapper that makes using those things easy.

478
00:32:30,454 --> 00:32:39,435
Speaker 1: Yeah don't actually need to use Docker which is John general problem where a lot of technology in the last couple decades will Exist and be used.

479
00:32:39,515 --> 00:32:44,895
Speaker 1: but most of the documentation that people have access to explains how to use it But doesn't explain why.

480
00:32:44,956 --> 00:32:51,671
Speaker 1: so the people using it don't have a working mental model of what it's doing And then when it misbehaves they cannot troubleshoot it Exactly.

481
00:32:51,952 --> 00:32:58,090
Speaker 0: So Docker is just a bunch of wrapper scripts around that to you know, make make using it easy.

482
00:32:58,251 --> 00:32:59,595
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're not saying that's wrong.

483
00:32:59,716 --> 00:33:00,238
Speaker 1: It should like.

484
00:33:00,338 --> 00:33:02,084
Speaker 1: using that stuff natively would be a nightmare.

485
00:33:02,325 --> 00:33:03,510
Speaker 1: The doctor did a good thing.

486
00:33:04,052 --> 00:33:06,625
Speaker 1: It's yeah, if you use Docker, but don't know what doctors doing.

487
00:33:07,268 --> 00:33:21,603
Speaker 0: However somebody named Julia Evans has produced the zine that you can purchase for $12 and get a PDF or Print it out or whatever Or you can pay like 170 dollars and get it for your whole company.

488
00:33:21,844 --> 00:33:23,329
Speaker 0: Oh if everyone needs to learn it.

489
00:33:24,791 --> 00:33:28,641
Speaker 0: And it's called how containers work and it's cute little cartoons.

490
00:33:28,981 --> 00:33:29,944
Speaker 1: Oh, these look great.

491
00:33:30,445 --> 00:33:32,350
Speaker 0: that completely explain in.

492
00:33:33,532 --> 00:33:41,112
Speaker 0: You know language you can understand and graphics Containers seem weird because they are weird Exactly.

493
00:33:41,935 --> 00:33:43,582
Speaker 0: And yeah, it teaches you about pivot root.

494
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:44,846
Speaker 0: It teaches about layers.

495
00:33:44,906 --> 00:33:52,808
Speaker 0: It teaches you about I'll you know see groups the namespaces all that stuff that I learned in that video including extra stuff.

496
00:33:52,848 --> 00:33:53,430
Speaker 0: I didn't know.

497
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:57,662
Speaker 0: And a handy like 20-something page zine.

498
00:33:57,883 --> 00:33:59,810
Speaker 0: you'll learn better than you will from the YouTube video.

499
00:34:01,232 --> 00:34:09,489
Speaker 0: This is really helpful And if you need to ever do anything involving a Linux container This might be the best documentation available.

500
00:34:10,851 --> 00:34:12,295
Speaker 0: Is this cute cartoon zine?

501
00:34:12,315 --> 00:34:13,560
Speaker 0: because I don't see any other.

502
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,350
Speaker 0: unless you want to like, you know read Linux kernel biz.

503
00:34:17,551 --> 00:34:19,458
Speaker 0: This is this is your best shot out there.

504
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,745
Speaker 1: So this looks really good.

505
00:34:20,966 --> 00:34:21,989
Speaker 1: I think I might actually buy.

506
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:24,728
Speaker 0: Yeah, where was this before when I was watching that YouTube video?

507
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:34,723
Speaker 1: That's the other thing that's annoying me lately is a lot of things will get implemented and the only documentation Including our ITMP server is a YouTube video.

508
00:34:34,743 --> 00:34:36,449
Speaker 1: someone made like give me words.

509
00:34:37,072 --> 00:34:38,114
Speaker 0: There are several.

510
00:34:38,235 --> 00:34:42,530
Speaker 0: I have found several good how to make wire guard work things.

511
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,315
Speaker 1: There you go.

512
00:34:44,476 --> 00:34:45,741
Speaker 1: Yeah, but not everything has that.

513
00:34:45,781 --> 00:34:47,427
Speaker 1: there are thing even like.

514
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:48,149
Speaker 1: of all.

515
00:34:48,591 --> 00:34:54,409
Speaker 1: Adobe is one of the few companies that has what I would call sufficient written documentation for their product.

516
00:34:54,550 --> 00:35:02,155
Speaker 0: Adobe has like a whole I think like several teams of people that are like outreach people specifically pushing tutorials Like they have a tutorial app.

517
00:35:02,275 --> 00:35:10,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, right Pushing out tutorials daily like tutorials learn Photoshop stuff.

518
00:35:10,353 --> 00:35:11,410
Speaker 1: I'm talking about documentation.

519
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:23,769
Speaker 1: Like if you go into Adobe like audition and pick some crazy random filter that does something weird and you click on help There is a detailed and accurate explanation of exactly what all those parameters do.

520
00:35:24,732 --> 00:35:35,270
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, like yeah, Adobe definitely tries hard to push tutorials and Documentation For its users to help people learn their stuff, right?

521
00:35:36,251 --> 00:35:37,237
Speaker 0: That's how they make their money.

522
00:35:37,277 --> 00:35:41,950
Speaker 0: They want you to become a master of their stuff Right and then not want to switch to some other stuff.

523
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:42,814
Speaker 0: I mean it worked on me.

524
00:35:43,176 --> 00:35:46,270
Speaker 0: I was you're one of those people who's afraid of learning something else.

525
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:52,386
Speaker 1: I would Probably I don't know what I do Like if I had to read like learn some other bullshit pipeline to make audio like.

526
00:35:52,426 --> 00:35:53,290
Speaker 1: I've used Pro Tools.

527
00:35:53,391 --> 00:35:54,658
Speaker 1: I've used a lot of those other tools.

528
00:35:55,201 --> 00:35:56,830
Speaker 1: I don't like any of them, right?

529
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:57,091
Speaker 0: They don't.

530
00:35:57,132 --> 00:36:00,751
Speaker 0: I also don't want you to bounce off their software by not being able to figure it out Right.

531
00:36:00,771 --> 00:36:06,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, but lots of time and money into teaching more maybe more than any other big software company.

532
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:14,162
Speaker 1: Yeah, so in the meta moment, we're not really reading the tale of Hanzo right now because we're too busy Tale busy doing nothing.

533
00:36:14,868 --> 00:36:30,969
Speaker 1: Uh However, once it gets warmer like give me a month I suspect when I go out biking in the evenings and on weekends I might just like stop in a park not of near any people under a tree and read Mm-hmm, in which case I might start reading the tale of Genji again.

534
00:36:31,331 --> 00:36:33,238
Speaker 1: But to otherwise this matter by the other meta moments.

535
00:36:33,439 --> 00:36:40,250
Speaker 1: while we are not doing any conventions for the foreseeable future I am continuing to take the reviews we have done of board games.

536
00:36:41,014 --> 00:36:42,250
Speaker 1: Cut them out of their episodes.

537
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:46,430
Speaker 1: You don't have to hear me talk about like 20 minutes of being annoyed at slow people on their bikes.

538
00:36:46,711 --> 00:36:50,710
Speaker 1: You can just hear the review of the thing and I got another one of those up.

539
00:36:51,011 --> 00:36:58,797
Speaker 1: We reviewed a game that we played at PAX East which I think was 4,000 years ago at this point Called no return.

540
00:36:58,818 --> 00:37:06,570
Speaker 1: That is a legit crazy good game And if you did not listen to our episode that was 58 minutes long where we reviewed this game and another game.

541
00:37:06,993 --> 00:37:09,050
Speaker 1: You can watch this 10 minute YouTube video.

542
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:13,726
Speaker 1: That is just the review of this game and then buy this game because it's great and some odd.

543
00:37:13,746 --> 00:37:14,850
Speaker 0: some technology meta.

544
00:37:15,576 --> 00:37:17,069
Speaker 0: the new release of Ubuntu.

545
00:37:17,314 --> 00:37:36,322
Speaker 0: Ubuntu The LTS release 2024 2020 which will be you know stable and supported till 2025 Just came out and I'm taking this opportunity to update all of geek night's Technology infrastructure so that I won't have to do it again for five years.

546
00:37:36,342 --> 00:37:41,127
Speaker 0: Hopefully because this is the time I'm trapped inside I won't have to do it again when I could be outside.

547
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:53,252
Speaker 1: Generally we're actually you might have seen we've slowed down not just because we're not to conventions But we've slowed down a lot of our ancillary projects and that's because of all these infrastructure investments We're working on.

548
00:37:53,293 --> 00:37:58,650
Speaker 0: so if you know that the point is if you notice downtime of any geek night's technology services.

549
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:03,264
Speaker 0: That's why and also if you notice improvement of any geek nice technology services.

550
00:38:03,304 --> 00:38:04,287
Speaker 0: Those are coming as well.

551
00:38:04,347 --> 00:38:13,250
Speaker 1: Yeah slowly But along those lines like go check out our forum and look around in there We're trying to update our like commit code of conduct for our community.

552
00:38:13,371 --> 00:38:16,750
Speaker 1: We're doing a lot of stuff and you can be a part of a lot of these changes.

553
00:38:17,131 --> 00:38:20,364
Speaker 1: Go poke around at all our places and look for the things we're asking for.

554
00:38:20,886 --> 00:38:21,830
Speaker 1: one of the things I'll highlight.

555
00:38:22,612 --> 00:38:28,870
Speaker 1: I'll mention this partly because our plan kind of got disrupted because of the quarantine so TBD on what the actual plan is.

556
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:39,613
Speaker 1: but if you were say Interested in contributing content to a zine that would be possibly distributed at gaming conventions in the future I'll hit us up.

557
00:38:39,894 --> 00:38:41,961
Speaker 1: just if that sounds interesting to you at all.

558
00:38:42,503 --> 00:38:44,249
Speaker 1: talk to us and we'll see what happens.

559
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:50,790
Speaker 1: Also keeping that vague because I don't know when and how we can do what we wanted to do in light of the current world.

560
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,989
Speaker 1: So I'm not gonna commit to anything more than what I just said.

561
00:38:54,153 --> 00:39:02,677
Speaker 0: Yeah, the other thing is Alright, I've seen a lot of people running like online only conventions Which is a thing we could appear at.

562
00:39:02,958 --> 00:39:03,139
Speaker 1: Yep.

563
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:07,856
Speaker 1: It's also a thing we could run but I'm too busy for that Doing that but I will.

564
00:39:07,876 --> 00:39:09,562
Speaker 0: I'm not doing that but I will appear.

565
00:39:09,582 --> 00:39:13,446
Speaker 0: if someone wants its nose of an online Convention that will let us appear at it.

566
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:17,021
Speaker 0: Let us know because I've seen some podcast ones and I've seen some.

567
00:39:17,041 --> 00:39:24,790
Speaker 1: we were invited to join one that was gaming related But they were doing audio only panels and I went through every panel we've recorded.

568
00:39:25,734 --> 00:39:34,690
Speaker 1: if you don't have the slides like they don't make any fucking sense because we Use those slides pretty heavily when we talk and we'll often not say things out loud that are on the slides.

569
00:39:35,212 --> 00:39:38,790
Speaker 0: Exactly, we need the kind where it's like a webinar where everyone watches us or something.

570
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:46,309
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you want a live stream like I saw for example, some people were doing Relevant to the episode where we're about to do an RTMP.

571
00:39:46,491 --> 00:39:48,744
Speaker 0: They were having a live stream and they would just.

572
00:39:48,965 --> 00:39:49,770
Speaker 0: it was one channel.

573
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:56,930
Speaker 0: You'd sit there and watch and it was like you're sitting in a panel room and it would space Lee Import different streams to switch between the different people.

574
00:39:57,131 --> 00:39:59,950
Speaker 1: So think of it this way because we're gonna make like panels and stuff on our own.

575
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,277
Speaker 1: But if there's an online conference like that.

576
00:40:02,618 --> 00:40:06,710
Speaker 1: where you want us to talk about things we haven't talked about already.

577
00:40:07,292 --> 00:40:18,602
Speaker 1: That is an inducement to get us to make a panel on that topic is to get us invited to appear on one of those things because we have a lot of time to write panels and Now is the time for us to do the panels

578
00:40:18,864 --> 00:40:19,850
Speaker 0: and know where to do the panel.

579
00:40:19,931 --> 00:40:21,289
Speaker 0: Yes, so no incentive to write one.

580
00:40:21,531 --> 00:40:30,865
Speaker 1: but also we can do the kinds of content that is a little more adventurous or experimental or Difficult to get through the line on the kinds of conventions.

581
00:40:30,905 --> 00:40:35,580
Speaker 1: We normally attend Exactly, so you can be self-interested in this.

582
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:39,628
Speaker 1: if you want us to talk about something that you think we'd be good at that We just have not talked about yet.

583
00:40:40,176 --> 00:40:41,553
Speaker 1: So, uh, yeah Let us know.

584
00:40:41,593 --> 00:40:46,742
Speaker 1: and also if you find any of these conferences that are awesome Post about it in the forum because I will gladly attend.

585
00:40:46,762 --> 00:40:48,229
Speaker 0: on the good thing about ya.

586
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:51,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, the other good thing about these online conventions is maybe they'll just record.

587
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,198
Speaker 0: It's like I could attend them after.

588
00:40:53,238 --> 00:40:58,822
Speaker 1: if the timings not good course recording It might be difficult for a lot of people which leads into what this show is about.

589
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:13,273
Speaker 1: So back in God 2007 or 8. we did a live stream of geek nights like on a couch in Beacon Right.

590
00:41:13,313 --> 00:41:15,660
Speaker 0: We did that with a webcam plugged into a computer.

591
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:22,098
Speaker 1: in an era before like any streaming technology existed We used like you stream Right, exactly.

592
00:41:22,118 --> 00:41:23,223
Speaker 0: We just webcam and computer.

593
00:41:23,243 --> 00:41:24,690
Speaker 0: There was no stuff going on.

594
00:41:25,173 --> 00:41:29,193
Speaker 1: We had halogen bulbs that were too hot Pointed at us.

595
00:41:29,213 --> 00:41:31,643
Speaker 1: think it was a nightmare in 2013.

596
00:41:31,643 --> 00:41:39,961
Speaker 1: We did a video or an episode on live-streaming video which is Completely out of date now because 2013 was a long time ago.

597
00:41:39,981 --> 00:41:43,290
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, so like that didn't know it as much back then.

598
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:43,774
Speaker 1: Yeah, what?

599
00:41:43,815 --> 00:41:45,109
Speaker 1: not only do we not know as much but?

600
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:50,952
Speaker 1: Consumer level or prosumer level technology did not really exist in 2013.

601
00:41:50,952 --> 00:41:56,959
Speaker 1: So it was hard to do a lot of this without professional equipment and even a lot of the professional equipment was not great back then.

602
00:41:58,032 --> 00:42:02,910
Speaker 0: Fast forward definitely newer better technologies available for you today that are right.

603
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:06,561
Speaker 0: I remember back like even the capture cards that I had back then.

604
00:42:06,682 --> 00:42:08,427
Speaker 0: Oh my god not support 1080p, dude.

605
00:42:09,531 --> 00:42:09,875
Speaker 1: I had that.

606
00:42:10,117 --> 00:42:16,950
Speaker 1: I tried to use that Aver TV USB to record a console and that's when I discovered that the latency on that thing was like eight seconds.

607
00:42:17,732 --> 00:42:20,240
Speaker 0: Well I bought like that elgato for cheap at PAX.

608
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,985
Speaker 0: yeah, I also bought the totally.

609
00:42:22,105 --> 00:42:23,710
Speaker 0: it totally crashed and stopped working.

610
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:25,818
Speaker 1: Yeah, that elgato just didn't fucking work like.

611
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:32,519
Speaker 1: I think I live stream successfully with it two or three times Yep, and now I've got this Aver one that works great.

612
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:36,462
Speaker 1: Yeah, I might end up getting the same one because well There's a newer model.

613
00:42:36,482 --> 00:42:37,010
Speaker 0: get the newer one.

614
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:38,337
Speaker 1: Yeah, well the same kind of thing.

615
00:42:38,357 --> 00:42:47,490
Speaker 1: because one thing I looked into now that we're getting into the main bit but I looked into HDMI capture cards, but I want a pro one cuz prosumer level stuff isn't that great.

616
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:51,546
Speaker 1: I want multi input, and I discovered the final limitation.

617
00:42:51,566 --> 00:42:56,703
Speaker 1: for the first time in my life I hit a hardware limitation on the kind of workstation that I build.

618
00:42:57,064 --> 00:43:00,590
Speaker 1: you know what you need a lot of for good HDMI input capture cards.

619
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:05,810
Speaker 1: PCIe lanes you know what most computers don't have a lot of PCIe lanes.

620
00:43:06,412 --> 00:43:14,092
Speaker 1: Yep, if you don't know what a PCIe lane is I hope you're not trying to make Video hardware Right.

621
00:43:14,132 --> 00:43:15,055
Speaker 0: okay, so here's the.

622
00:43:15,256 --> 00:43:16,099
Speaker 0: is the deal right?

623
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,050
Speaker 0: so let's say you want to do some web streaming?

624
00:43:19,252 --> 00:43:20,967
Speaker 0: Yeah, right you know twitch or YouTube?

625
00:43:20,987 --> 00:43:24,050
Speaker 0: right well It's really easy to do because all you got to do is open OBS.

626
00:43:24,552 --> 00:43:25,956
Speaker 0: Yeah, and learn how to use OBS.

627
00:43:26,077 --> 00:43:31,839
Speaker 0: and what you do is you make a scene and in that scene you can incorporate all your Sources of video and audio.

628
00:43:31,879 --> 00:43:34,050
Speaker 0: right you might have audio sources like your microphone.

629
00:43:34,392 --> 00:43:37,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, you might have audio sources like some sound that's playing on your computer.

630
00:43:37,791 --> 00:43:40,230
Speaker 1: I've dragged one of my OBS's into the stream, so you can see it.

631
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:43,120
Speaker 1: I'm gonna drag the second OBS into the stream so you can see it.

632
00:43:43,582 --> 00:43:48,080
Speaker 0: right you might have other audio sources Like another friend with another microphone.

633
00:43:48,502 --> 00:43:54,430
Speaker 0: you might have audio sources Video sources like capturing a video game that's playing on the computer.

634
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,778
Speaker 0: Yeah, webcam all sorts of things.

635
00:43:56,818 --> 00:44:00,070
Speaker 0: right, but you can only stream things that you can capture.

636
00:44:00,231 --> 00:44:03,943
Speaker 0: So basically anything you want to display and stream out to people.

637
00:44:04,344 --> 00:44:10,670
Speaker 0: you need some way of getting that Video and audio data into that computer and the computer only has so many holes.

638
00:44:11,112 --> 00:44:15,209
Speaker 0: So the holes you often end up using are the USB holes your webcam connects to USB.

639
00:44:15,811 --> 00:44:17,716
Speaker 0: Yeah, right or not?

640
00:44:17,776 --> 00:44:20,142
Speaker 0: even a hole just in the computer memory itself.

641
00:44:20,222 --> 00:44:22,006
Speaker 0: your game is playing right.

642
00:44:22,086 --> 00:44:24,634
Speaker 0: the the video of that game Is in a frame buffer.

643
00:44:24,654 --> 00:44:30,955
Speaker 0: OBS can look at the images of that game right after it and like a webcam is just USB It'll just work the same.

644
00:44:31,095 --> 00:44:32,199
Speaker 1: like that.

645
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,644
Speaker 1: that camera is just a webcam.

646
00:44:33,665 --> 00:44:35,170
Speaker 1: There's literally nothing fancy going on.

647
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:39,510
Speaker 0: So let's say you want to stream your Nintendo switch right where your Nintendo switch is outside your computer.

648
00:44:39,631 --> 00:44:41,318
Speaker 0: So what you need is need a capture card.

649
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:45,879
Speaker 0: the capture card is HDMI in and HDMI out Because you need to then display.

650
00:44:45,899 --> 00:44:47,729
Speaker 0: you need to be able to see the game to play it, right?

651
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:52,970
Speaker 0: So you have HDMI in from the switch out to your TV so you can see the video game.

652
00:44:53,010 --> 00:45:03,670
Speaker 0: So you can play and then USB out from the capture card Goes to the computer that runs OBS and you add that image to your scene on OBS and you stream and you're good to go.

653
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:09,030
Speaker 0: Yep, right the problem is is that when you want to do anything complicated, right?

654
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:14,482
Speaker 0: Suddenly you're in a situation where it's like you just can't do it.

655
00:45:14,542 --> 00:45:16,950
Speaker 0: Let's say, you know, I'm here and rim is far away.

656
00:45:17,091 --> 00:45:18,289
Speaker 0: Yeah, we want to be in the same.

657
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:21,147
Speaker 0: So, you know both our faces next to each other in the same stream.

658
00:45:21,187 --> 00:45:27,529
Speaker 1: previously I had two webcams plugged into two USB ports pointed at each of our faces right all plugged into one PC.

659
00:45:28,471 --> 00:45:38,950
Speaker 0: Let's say I got like a LAN party and even though everyone's in the same room There's too many computers, right and I can't plug in four capture cards on the same computer.

660
00:45:39,051 --> 00:45:40,527
Speaker 0: It just doesn't work, right?

661
00:45:41,231 --> 00:45:53,004
Speaker 0: I need some other way to get all of these different video and audio sources into a single OBS right To compose a single scene to stream it out to the world.

662
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:54,328
Speaker 0: How do you do this?

663
00:45:54,649 --> 00:45:54,830
Speaker 0: Right?

664
00:45:55,310 --> 00:46:07,170
Speaker 0: Well, this is technology called RTMP the real-time messaging protocol I believe and RTMP is actually what they used way back in the day to do live streams with Adobe Flash.

665
00:46:07,511 --> 00:46:09,518
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's it was invented by Adobe.

666
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:10,381
Speaker 0: It's open.

667
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:11,606
Speaker 0: It's like an open protocol.

668
00:46:11,626 --> 00:46:12,770
Speaker 0: It's not a secret or anything.

669
00:46:13,031 --> 00:46:17,913
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a bunch of extensions to it, but you can't really use those in most cases Right.

670
00:46:17,934 --> 00:46:28,250
Speaker 0: So in the earliest days of like watching like professional Streams like you know on the YouTube not YouTube, but like the internet you'd be like someone's doing a live stream of a thing.

671
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:29,193
Speaker 0: It's a special thing.

672
00:46:29,273 --> 00:46:34,450
Speaker 1: They're probably go to their website software and they're probably right like a tricaster or something exactly.

673
00:46:34,532 --> 00:46:35,368
Speaker 0: You'd go to their website.

674
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:36,656
Speaker 0: You'd be like you need flash.

675
00:46:36,797 --> 00:46:42,083
Speaker 0: or there was also that Microsoft thing for a while that died And old Adobe like Adobe suites.

676
00:46:42,244 --> 00:46:43,450
Speaker 1: you could just get that software.

677
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:48,710
Speaker 1: There's a lot of software that Adobe has gotten rid of over the years that managed some of this stuff, right?

678
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:50,809
Speaker 0: But yeah that all used this thing called RTMP.

679
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:57,230
Speaker 0: So what we've done nowadays is there are lots of alternatives to RTMP because honestly it's sort of a junky old protocol.

680
00:46:57,411 --> 00:46:58,354
Speaker 1: I mean think of it this way.

681
00:46:58,615 --> 00:47:03,110
Speaker 1: It's video right video streaming, but it uses TCP for some inexplicable reason.

682
00:47:03,611 --> 00:47:06,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's junky and old but for some it still works, right?

683
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,763
Speaker 0: It gets the job done.

684
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,207
Speaker 0: It handles HD.

685
00:47:09,247 --> 00:47:10,330
Speaker 0: It handles everything, right?

686
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:11,655
Speaker 0: It's just junky and old.

687
00:47:12,439 --> 00:47:20,209
Speaker 0: so there have been newer protocols that are better designed Or right they work and have additional features that may or may not matter to you.

688
00:47:20,692 --> 00:47:23,309
Speaker 0: But RTMP works and there's a lot of support for it.

689
00:47:23,711 --> 00:47:27,510
Speaker 0: So it's like you might as well just use it unless it doesn't work for you.

690
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:35,071
Speaker 1: Yes, I mean the default like if you want to stream something to like YouTube or Twitch It's literally just an RTMP destination with the stream key Exactly.

691
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:42,715
Speaker 0: So the way this works is you want to use RTMP and what you have to think of it is that You're replacing it.

692
00:47:42,996 --> 00:47:47,190
Speaker 0: Imagine you had one computer to do the streaming and all your sources at HDMI cables.

693
00:47:47,672 --> 00:47:53,577
Speaker 0: What you're doing is you're replacing the HDMI cable with a network connection Yep, and using RTMP.

694
00:47:54,018 --> 00:48:00,164
Speaker 0: right Ethernet or Wi-Fi or cellular right is now Your HDMI cable is now a network cable instead.

695
00:48:00,425 --> 00:48:01,169
Speaker 1: Yep, right.

696
00:48:01,751 --> 00:48:02,575
Speaker 1: So what you do?

697
00:48:02,595 --> 00:48:11,470
Speaker 1: so what Scott is doing is Scott is running OBS in his house And in his house, he's got a fancy microphone plugged in and OBS is just getting that audio.

698
00:48:11,772 --> 00:48:14,650
Speaker 1: He's got a camera plugged in and OBS is getting that video.

699
00:48:15,172 --> 00:48:18,343
Speaker 1: They are locally synced and he's sending me an RTMP stream.

700
00:48:18,644 --> 00:48:24,389
Speaker 0: That is that audio in that video And that stream is now a source in RIMS OBS.

701
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:33,590
Speaker 0: Just like I have an OBS that I'm not streaming to YouTube I'm streaming to RIM and RIM is incorporating my stream into his stream as a source.

702
00:48:33,991 --> 00:48:39,982
Speaker 0: So it's like I have a super long HDMI cable going all the way to RIMS house But we're just using a network cable instead.

703
00:48:40,002 --> 00:48:41,110
Speaker 1: I pulled it all into the stream.

704
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:43,750
Speaker 1: So we've got an amazing ridiculous recursion here.

705
00:48:44,112 --> 00:48:53,070
Speaker 1: But the problem is OBS for as good as it is Cannot just directly accept an RTMP stream like it's not a server, right?

706
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:56,463
Speaker 0: You'd have to open up like a port on your computer and it'd be weird.

707
00:48:56,624 --> 00:48:58,430
Speaker 0: It's just OBS doesn't do that Yep.

708
00:48:58,651 --> 00:49:01,882
Speaker 1: So what we've got in the middle of all that is an nginx server.

709
00:49:02,223 --> 00:49:05,393
Speaker 1: if you're not familiar if we've done a show on nginx I feel like I don't know.

710
00:49:05,774 --> 00:49:14,519
Speaker 1: nginx is a web server that sort of replaced Apache mostly just easier to use than Apache Because most of what Apache does it's not what anyone needs.

711
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:15,522
Speaker 0: Apache still out there.

712
00:49:15,562 --> 00:49:17,227
Speaker 0: I still use it for some things.

713
00:49:17,268 --> 00:49:21,410
Speaker 0: but yeah It's just a web server, but you can make extensions for it.

714
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:23,539
Speaker 0: And for some reason I don't understand the reason.

715
00:49:24,062 --> 00:49:27,253
Speaker 0: instead of making like an RTMP server That's like a standalone product.

716
00:49:27,695 --> 00:49:33,550
Speaker 0: right the most popular way to make an RTMP server for free is this nginx RTMP extension.

717
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:34,794
Speaker 0: So it's like everyone.

718
00:49:34,834 --> 00:49:35,938
Speaker 1: like nginx is the thing.

719
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:37,082
Speaker 1: it's like node.

720
00:49:37,162 --> 00:49:37,985
Speaker 1: everyone just uses it.

721
00:49:38,025 --> 00:49:40,857
Speaker 1: anytime you want to proxy anything They'll just make an nginx module.

722
00:49:40,897 --> 00:49:41,380
Speaker 1: Basically.

723
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:46,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know why it's sort of a hacky way to do it But again, it's junky but it somehow works.

724
00:49:47,315 --> 00:49:50,269
Speaker 1: So I'm running an nginx server on my PC right now.

725
00:49:50,691 --> 00:49:57,875
Speaker 1: I have opened ports and forwarding so Scott is streaming this to me via the RTMP protocol and this server Does almost nothing.

726
00:49:57,955 --> 00:50:07,470
Speaker 1: it's using like 0.1 percent CPU because all it does is take that RTMP stream in and Make it available for me to pull via OBS.

727
00:50:08,273 --> 00:50:16,182
Speaker 0: Yep, so here's is the thing that you know that there's a lot of these hidden advantages of using RTMP and an RTMP server for streaming that people.

728
00:50:16,503 --> 00:50:18,110
Speaker 0: it's not immediately apparent, right?

729
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:26,674
Speaker 0: so the first thing is that the RTMP server like rim said doesn't take a lot of CPU because it's not doing encoding unless you Tell it to write.

730
00:50:26,954 --> 00:50:37,589
Speaker 0: the final OBS is doing all the encoding and you know a transcoding of video Composing a scene to send to YouTube or whoever and that takes CPU power to do.

731
00:50:38,111 --> 00:50:43,605
Speaker 0: But just taking streams and moving pushing bits along your only limitation is your bandwidth.

732
00:50:43,866 --> 00:50:49,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm pushing out Megabit, right which is way more than necessary.

733
00:50:50,411 --> 00:50:59,950
Speaker 1: Now Scott has sent me since we started doing this show 10 gigabytes of data and I have sent myself because I am my OBS Is not going to YouTube nor is my yeah.

734
00:51:00,911 --> 00:51:08,838
Speaker 1: Accepting Scott my OBS is broadcasting to a local host port to this same RTMP server And I've sent myself 11 gigabytes of data so far.

735
00:51:09,501 --> 00:51:09,661
Speaker 0: Yep.

736
00:51:10,023 --> 00:51:13,778
Speaker 0: It's like I'm doing 1080p 60 FPS Right and YouTube or twitch.

737
00:51:13,798 --> 00:51:15,184
Speaker 0: They only want six megabit.

738
00:51:15,204 --> 00:51:15,947
Speaker 0: They don't want 20 20 is insane.

739
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:17,555
Speaker 0: They're like blah.

740
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:19,548
Speaker 0: they won't let you send them 20 even right?

741
00:51:21,071 --> 00:51:24,501
Speaker 0: But because I'm sending you know 20 to rim.

742
00:51:24,862 --> 00:51:27,007
Speaker 0: it doesn't take any of my CPU, right?

743
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:27,850
Speaker 0: It's really easy.

744
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:33,405
Speaker 0: Point at which we're using a lot of CPU is that final computer that does the encoding.

745
00:51:33,685 --> 00:51:36,823
Speaker 0: everything else is just pushing crazy high quality.

746
00:51:37,267 --> 00:51:49,088
Speaker 0: so Advantage one of doing it this way is that you could actually record each of these separate sources individually, right and that would only eat up your storage space.

747
00:51:49,108 --> 00:51:52,619
Speaker 0: and Those individual recordings would be super high quality.

748
00:51:52,680 --> 00:52:00,890
Speaker 0: if you only record that final encoded stream You're losing a lot of that original quality because it's all been encoded away in the compression.

749
00:52:02,212 --> 00:52:06,030
Speaker 0: So by having all those individual source recordings, it's super high quality.

750
00:52:06,712 --> 00:52:11,123
Speaker 0: You can now say later on make a YouTube video that you upload.

751
00:52:11,364 --> 00:52:14,716
Speaker 0: that is ridiculously high quality higher quality than Recording of the stream.

752
00:52:15,178 --> 00:52:18,475
Speaker 1: Yep, right and it also reduces recompression.

753
00:52:18,798 --> 00:52:26,834
Speaker 1: just re-encoding Artifacts because I'm getting a very high quality stream from Scott that I'm then down mixing at the very end of the pipeline Right.

754
00:52:27,157 --> 00:52:28,950
Speaker 0: Also, let's say you're doing PC games.

755
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:34,470
Speaker 0: Right, if you're streaming from the same computer that you're playing the PC game on directly to YouTube or Twitch.

756
00:52:34,891 --> 00:52:39,470
Speaker 0: Well now the computer has to play the game, but your CPU also has to do the video encoding.

757
00:52:39,571 --> 00:52:41,124
Speaker 0: Your CPU is doing double duty, right?

758
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:47,130
Speaker 0: So you're basically you push by you sending an RTMP stream to an RTMP server, right?

759
00:52:47,611 --> 00:52:59,183
Speaker 0: That encoding is happening somewhere else either on a second computer or you can configure the RTMP server to sort of be To do to do the send but to twitch or YouTube or to multiple places.

760
00:52:59,765 --> 00:53:04,178
Speaker 0: right and have it do the encoding And that's save your computer.

761
00:53:04,198 --> 00:53:06,810
Speaker 0: This needs to use its CPU for playing doom eternal.

762
00:53:07,091 --> 00:53:12,630
Speaker 0: Yeah can spend it playing doom eternal and use very small amount of CPU to just push bits of what's on your screen.

763
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:12,931
Speaker 0: Yep.

764
00:53:12,971 --> 00:53:20,556
Speaker 1: Now if you have a real gaming PC like a serious one and you're just streaming your own game and things locally connected to it That's usually not a problem.

765
00:53:20,596 --> 00:53:22,528
Speaker 1: It usually will not interfere with your game at all.

766
00:53:23,293 --> 00:53:30,669
Speaker 0: If you're someone who really cares about like, you know Not losing any frames and having your whole CPU for the the game then it might matter, you know.

767
00:53:31,313 --> 00:53:33,390
Speaker 0: Or if your CPUs weak and you want to do this anyway.

768
00:53:33,844 --> 00:53:37,355
Speaker 0: Yeah There's one thing where you can get an internet server in the cloud To do it.

769
00:53:37,576 --> 00:53:43,239
Speaker 1: the OBS is on the edge or sending a high bitrate Partly because that means there's less like compression it has to do.

770
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:56,387
Speaker 1: but we also set them to use pretty bullshitty Compression like don't spend a lot of time Mm-hmm, like don't spend a lot of resources doing better compression because compression gets better if you throw more CPU at it.

771
00:53:57,109 --> 00:54:00,790
Speaker 1: and If you throw a less CPU at it, it just won't be as good but it'll be good enough for this.

772
00:54:01,051 --> 00:54:04,450
Speaker 1: The high bitrate makes up for the lack of CPU resources, right?

773
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:09,590
Speaker 0: So now the other advantage you have here is that you know, let's say you're streaming on your local computer, right?

774
00:54:09,991 --> 00:54:10,774
Speaker 0: Well, you know.

775
00:54:10,835 --> 00:54:14,790
Speaker 0: now you got like, you know, you start your stream you stop your stream, right?

776
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:16,275
Speaker 0: You're trying to mess with things.

777
00:54:16,315 --> 00:54:18,783
Speaker 0: you get to check your audio every time right.

778
00:54:18,803 --> 00:54:20,730
Speaker 0: your stream always starts out weird, right?

779
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:28,070
Speaker 0: By having this edge OBS that's doing the final stream, right and all the other sources are sort of behind it.

780
00:54:28,551 --> 00:54:32,764
Speaker 0: You can turn that one on right and your stream is live and it's not going anywhere.

781
00:54:33,386 --> 00:54:34,730
Speaker 0: and all those other streams?

782
00:54:35,292 --> 00:54:37,984
Speaker 0: You can test them out without having to show them to anyone.

783
00:54:38,265 --> 00:54:40,573
Speaker 0: you can just open VLC If you have to.

784
00:54:40,673 --> 00:54:45,530
Speaker 0: if you don't have any other way to do it, yep, and play one of those RTMP streams directly.

785
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:56,103
Speaker 0: It's like and you could just like watch me on the stream without streaming me to the internet See how it is See how it sounds see how it looks and then incorporate me into the scene once I'm ready.

786
00:54:56,705 --> 00:55:00,537
Speaker 0: and then now your stream is way More professional because it's all.

787
00:55:00,617 --> 00:55:10,610
Speaker 0: if you turns on you have a nice screen that says going live soon Doing all your testing behind the scenes right you update your you know, you switch your scene in OBS.

788
00:55:11,454 --> 00:55:12,709
Speaker 0: You go live, right?

789
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:17,436
Speaker 0: let's say you have to go to the bathroom and you've got like a Mobile streaming setup with like.

790
00:55:17,697 --> 00:55:20,869
Speaker 0: you're gonna stream directly from your iPhone, right and you don't want to hover it.

791
00:55:21,891 --> 00:55:22,453
Speaker 0: Right, you can.

792
00:55:22,513 --> 00:55:27,250
Speaker 0: you can actually do this the software for your phone iPhone or Android or iPad where you can just stream straight from?

793
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:31,089
Speaker 0: The phone either the phone camera or capturing what's on the screen of your phone.

794
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:35,363
Speaker 0: So what you do is your stream doesn't turn off right.

795
00:55:35,704 --> 00:55:37,170
Speaker 0: you just change scenes.

796
00:55:37,812 --> 00:55:42,808
Speaker 0: Well, you turn on your phone first you get it streaming you verify that it's working you switch scenes.

797
00:55:42,949 --> 00:55:45,378
Speaker 0: now You know your stream hasn't gone off.

798
00:55:45,538 --> 00:55:52,449
Speaker 0: people are watching on YouTube are still watching you but suddenly whoop It switches over to your phone and you're walking around with the phone.

799
00:55:53,152 --> 00:56:00,693
Speaker 0: Right and it's super professional because your phone is streaming to the RTMP server your computer streaming to the RTMP server Right.

800
00:56:00,733 --> 00:56:02,582
Speaker 0: your camera, maybe you got a separate camera.

801
00:56:02,623 --> 00:56:11,492
Speaker 0: that's streaming to the RTMP server Right and then the central OBS is just switching between scenes and it's hiding all the inelegant Devices.

802
00:56:11,512 --> 00:56:17,330
Speaker 0: turning on device turning off audio checks all those things are hidden because they're all being connected over the network.

803
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:21,536
Speaker 1: Yep, and the only drawback the only drawback at all Is this all told?

804
00:56:21,597 --> 00:56:24,189
Speaker 1: this introduces significant latency in your streams?

805
00:56:24,753 --> 00:56:28,754
Speaker 1: But at the very end that final OBS Whoever's managing that?

806
00:56:28,855 --> 00:56:36,650
Speaker 1: one can just watch the streams and fucks with the encode delays to sync them up Right as long as visual sources are self synced, right?

807
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:43,090
Speaker 0: That final stream is gonna be delayed behind the real world like you're gonna be seeing things heavily delayed.

808
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:46,430
Speaker 0: It's like I might clap and you'll hear the clap 30 seconds later.

809
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,554
Speaker 0: Maybe something like that.

810
00:56:47,714 --> 00:56:48,598
Speaker 1: that means

811
00:56:48,778 --> 00:57:01,250
Speaker 0: as long as I'm in sync with the other things on the screen Right, if we're me and remember both playing a game as long as I'm not a minute ahead of rim It doesn't matter if we're both together at the same time and we're both a minute behind the real world.

812
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:07,090
Speaker 1: But what that means is I cannot use the stream Scott is sending to me to interact with Scott.

813
00:57:07,491 --> 00:57:10,018
Speaker 1: So we have a separate out-of-band of all this.

814
00:57:10,039 --> 00:57:24,550
Speaker 1: We have a discord voice chat is how we're actually talking to each other and audio quality through all of this Even if unless you are super professional and know what you're doing and have good hardware Gonna be pretty shitty for a lot of reasons.

815
00:57:25,272 --> 00:57:31,729
Speaker 1: So you got to make sure that all the people in all your different destinations have like a good microphone good preamps all that stuff.

816
00:57:32,492 --> 00:57:38,036
Speaker 0: Well, like I was saying the RTMP service can be configured to do recording Yeah, and encoding right.

817
00:57:38,056 --> 00:57:38,999
Speaker 0: as a result that work.

818
00:57:39,019 --> 00:57:42,310
Speaker 1: Scott's voice is being sent to discord direct to me with low latency.

819
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:47,033
Speaker 1: It's also being sent through RTMP with much higher latency Yep.

820
00:57:47,194 --> 00:57:47,355
Speaker 0: Yep.

821
00:57:47,395 --> 00:57:47,556
Speaker 0: Yep.

822
00:57:48,361 --> 00:57:52,606
Speaker 0: So yeah, if you're doing any Moderately complicated streaming setup, right?

823
00:57:52,727 --> 00:57:55,435
Speaker 0: I highly recommend Figuring this stuff out.

824
00:57:55,535 --> 00:57:56,841
Speaker 0: It's not easy to do.

825
00:57:56,982 --> 00:58:04,290
Speaker 1: but look the config file for my nginx If is under a hundred lines and most of that is white space and comments, right?

826
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:04,734
Speaker 0: You have to.

827
00:58:04,754 --> 00:58:06,370
Speaker 0: still it's the documentation out there.

828
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:07,073
Speaker 0: There's a lot.

829
00:58:07,093 --> 00:58:10,969
Speaker 0: it took me so long to set this up because there's so many different recommendations out there.

830
00:58:11,133 --> 00:58:13,697
Speaker 0: Yeah so much conflicting info a lot of threat.

831
00:58:13,718 --> 00:58:19,159
Speaker 0: you'll search online for help on this and you'll find threads that are super super old and Is like is this still the right info?

832
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:20,728
Speaker 0: Yeah, I still be using this.

833
00:58:22,631 --> 00:58:23,273
Speaker 1: You'll learn.

834
00:58:23,293 --> 00:58:30,089
Speaker 1: you'll learn some things along the way like for example, you know how when you stream to like YouTube or whatever There's that stream key that you have to set up.

835
00:58:31,211 --> 00:58:37,189
Speaker 1: Now I know where that stream key is like where in the protocol that is used and it is stupid.

836
00:58:38,055 --> 00:58:39,709
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like super stupid.

837
00:58:40,731 --> 00:58:47,849
Speaker 1: But you're gonna have to learn how all these things work Like why the RTMP URLs and your eyes like look the way that they do.

838
00:58:48,432 --> 00:58:52,390
Speaker 1: But if you learn all of that, then you can be fluent in this real quick.

839
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:55,608
Speaker 1: It took me a couple hours of fucking with it to be a master.

840
00:58:56,505 --> 00:58:56,689
Speaker 0: Yep.

841
00:58:57,972 --> 00:58:59,520
Speaker 0: So yeah now there are.

842
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:07,469
Speaker 1: our quality is not perfect yet But that's just because I've not put the effort into a pipeline and because I'm literally running all of this on one PC.

843
00:59:09,052 --> 00:59:25,076
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you're streaming games, so basically if your use cases are Combining multiple things together in one stream Offloading encoding to a different computer because you're using a lot of CPU on the computer to play games or something You've got mobile you just get multiple.

844
00:59:25,096 --> 00:59:29,730
Speaker 0: you're switching between multiple different stream sources like living room bedroom outside the house.

845
00:59:30,592 --> 00:59:33,943
Speaker 0: You got a stream that you know, maybe has different people, right?

846
00:59:33,964 --> 00:59:39,603
Speaker 0: So it's like this you go to the geek nights channel It's me then it's rim then it's me again right switching back and forth.

847
00:59:39,623 --> 00:59:40,727
Speaker 0: He's streaming right now.

848
00:59:40,747 --> 00:59:41,570
Speaker 0: Yep, right?

849
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:43,393
Speaker 0: Anything fancy?

850
00:59:43,795 --> 00:59:53,939
Speaker 0: this is the road you have to go down where you replace your HDMI cables with network cables or Wi-Fi And you end up Saving money because now you have to buy hardware.

851
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,309
Speaker 1: Yeah, right video capture devices are not cheap.

852
00:59:57,311 --> 01:00:01,010
Speaker 0: Instead of buying a capture device you can just use a network cable, right?

853
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:07,930
Speaker 0: Why I was like I could take my iPad take an HDMI out into a capture device or the iPad could stream itself over Wi-Fi.

854
01:00:08,432 --> 01:00:09,054
Speaker 0: So right.

855
01:00:09,255 --> 01:00:12,246
Speaker 1: two last points there because there's some hardware I want to talk about.

856
01:00:12,287 --> 01:00:15,809
Speaker 1: but point number one This is just a very useful trick for all of you.

857
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:27,090
Speaker 1: If you want to do this and you want to run multiple OBS's Make a copy of your whole OBS directory and just update the shortcut and add a - - portable to the command.

858
01:00:27,672 --> 01:00:32,610
Speaker 1: That will run an OBS that state stores its own configuration locally and its own directory.

859
01:00:32,891 --> 01:00:37,689
Speaker 1: So you have multiple OBS's with totally different configs all startable independently on one PC.

860
01:00:38,932 --> 01:00:46,762
Speaker 1: That is that was not well documented, but I found it - you might think Why don't cameras just have RTMP?

861
01:00:46,782 --> 01:00:48,569
Speaker 1: and the answer is expensive cameras do.

862
01:00:49,491 --> 01:00:54,149
Speaker 0: Yep, you can buy like a $4,000 camcorder that actually does have RTMP.

863
01:00:54,392 --> 01:00:55,347
Speaker 0: It has like a LAN hook.

864
01:00:55,671 --> 01:01:00,150
Speaker 0: They can plug an ethernet cable into it and it could stream just on its own this camera just like boom.

865
01:01:00,311 --> 01:01:04,641
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if you have enough money or you have a studio where you're streaming That's the kind of thing you want to buy.

866
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:06,090
Speaker 0: that's probably really good and convenient.

867
01:01:07,198 --> 01:01:08,930
Speaker 0: But I gotta warn you we tried this out.

868
01:01:09,576 --> 01:01:10,828
Speaker 1: There is hardware.

869
01:01:11,431 --> 01:01:14,342
Speaker 1: You can just plug your kit like put on your camera with little antennas.

870
01:01:14,363 --> 01:01:16,310
Speaker 1: that'll do this and like Scott said it's crazy expensive.

871
01:01:16,874 --> 01:01:19,269
Speaker 1: There is cheaper hardware out there.

872
01:01:19,631 --> 01:01:28,432
Speaker 1: This ICV company seems to make most of it and a lot of the other devices I've seen with other brand names look like they're This hardware with a different brand name on it Right.

873
01:01:28,552 --> 01:01:41,526
Speaker 0: So like you could like I just said if you want to incorporate a device that has HDMI output but does not have Any sort of network output right and you don't want to buy a capture card or be tied down to.

874
01:01:41,908 --> 01:01:45,640
Speaker 0: you know The physical wire right plugged into a computer somewhere.

875
01:01:46,021 --> 01:01:54,569
Speaker 0: because think about it if you want to stream from a say a Nintendo switch Yeah, right You now need a computer to support that switch because the computer has to have the capture card plugged in with USB.

876
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:55,332
Speaker 1: Yeah, or here's my.

877
01:01:55,352 --> 01:02:01,030
Speaker 1: you know, I want to do live video streams for like the rims rants on patreon on Fridays instead of like.

878
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:02,057
Speaker 1: I want to do a nice video thing.

879
01:02:02,338 --> 01:02:03,325
Speaker 1: I want to set up in the living room.

880
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:04,130
Speaker 1: I have a nice backdrop.

881
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:05,355
Speaker 1: I can put my fancy camera.

882
01:02:05,817 --> 01:02:09,170
Speaker 1: So if my camera has a device on it, that'll just stream our TMP.

883
01:02:09,672 --> 01:02:14,010
Speaker 1: I just point it at the same server that we're using for geek nights and it just live streams.

884
01:02:14,331 --> 01:02:16,480
Speaker 0: I don't need to run an HDMI cable.

885
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,850
Speaker 0: You won't need to have another computer with a capture card.

886
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:20,095
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can just have camera.

887
01:02:20,357 --> 01:02:21,522
Speaker 0: go live with the camera.

888
01:02:21,622 --> 01:02:22,124
Speaker 0: good to go.

889
01:02:22,526 --> 01:02:23,330
Speaker 1: So here's the problem.

890
01:02:24,211 --> 01:02:26,419
Speaker 1: Unless you spend a couple thousand dollars.

891
01:02:26,499 --> 01:02:30,486
Speaker 1: These devices are complete and utter garbage.

892
01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:33,196
Speaker 1: Holy shit, is this a piece of shit?

893
01:02:33,677 --> 01:02:38,451
Speaker 0: there seems to be a big gulf between at the professional devices and the cheap ones Right.

894
01:02:38,491 --> 01:02:39,756
Speaker 0: So the professional devices?

895
01:02:39,816 --> 01:02:43,530
Speaker 0: I saw some out there that looked really good and obviously totally work.

896
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:44,613
Speaker 0: They do 1080p.

897
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:48,044
Speaker 0: They have strong CPUs that so they can encode the video properly.

898
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:49,228
Speaker 0: They have Wi-Fi.

899
01:02:49,248 --> 01:02:49,850
Speaker 0: they have Ethernet.

900
01:02:50,191 --> 01:02:54,048
Speaker 0: Some of them have LCD screens on them so you can preview the video that they're streaming up.

901
01:02:54,972 --> 01:02:56,317
Speaker 0: They're very configurable.

902
01:02:56,357 --> 01:02:57,200
Speaker 0: They have lots of features.

903
01:02:57,942 --> 01:03:14,613
Speaker 0: They'll have like all kinds of audio inputs sometimes SDI inputs, you know multiple HDMI in and out A large battery packs the ability to be plugged into the wall all kinds of features That you need right, but those will be very expensive.

904
01:03:14,633 --> 01:03:18,330
Speaker 1: So this bootleg one was like 170 on Alibaba.

905
01:03:18,471 --> 01:03:19,720
Speaker 1: I wisely super cheap.

906
01:03:19,981 --> 01:03:25,236
Speaker 1: I wisely chose to buy it on Amazon for 200 because Amazon is much easier to return things to.

907
01:03:25,356 --> 01:03:26,721
Speaker 0: it's basically the cheapest one Right.

908
01:03:26,741 --> 01:03:27,890
Speaker 0: So what is an HDMI?

909
01:03:27,971 --> 01:03:29,200
Speaker 0: It's exactly what we want, right?

910
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:30,204
Speaker 0: It's a black box.

911
01:03:30,305 --> 01:03:33,000
Speaker 1: It has a battery hole on the top so I can stick a battery in it.

912
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:33,964
Speaker 1: It's got two antenna.

913
01:03:34,124 --> 01:03:35,028
Speaker 1: It'll connect to Wi-Fi.

914
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:38,140
Speaker 1: It has an Ethernet port so I could just plug a LAN cable into it.

915
01:03:38,461 --> 01:03:40,586
Speaker 1: It's got an HDMI in bam.

916
01:03:40,727 --> 01:03:40,987
Speaker 0: Perfect.

917
01:03:41,008 --> 01:03:45,580
Speaker 0: So basically you can with that device you could turn anything that is HDMI output.

918
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:50,120
Speaker 0: It's like a camera right and it comes with a cold turn it into a live streaming camera.

919
01:03:50,401 --> 01:03:52,169
Speaker 1: So I mounted to my camera plugged it in.

920
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:54,780
Speaker 1: when you power it on it just has a web interface.

921
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:55,884
Speaker 1: You connect directly to it.

922
01:03:56,145 --> 01:03:59,215
Speaker 1: You can configure like four different sub streams.

923
01:03:59,315 --> 01:04:01,863
Speaker 1: It'll stream to four different destinations Simultaneously.

924
01:04:01,883 --> 01:04:10,025
Speaker 1: you set the bit rates it all just works and it kind of does all just work except It's tiny little bullshit.

925
01:04:10,045 --> 01:04:15,440
Speaker 1: CPU hit a hundred percent immediately with one stream going to one destination.

926
01:04:16,742 --> 01:04:23,270
Speaker 0: You couldn't even set what if you set the encoder to be like like we said, you know Don't try to compress the video to send all your bits.

927
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:26,120
Speaker 1: I tried every possible set of options.

928
01:04:26,761 --> 01:04:28,208
Speaker 1: Nothing would make this thing work.

929
01:04:28,469 --> 01:04:30,257
Speaker 1: I got it to a point where it didn't max out this.

930
01:04:30,278 --> 01:04:30,740
Speaker 0: well it worked.

931
01:04:30,841 --> 01:04:32,031
Speaker 0: It just worked crappily, right?

932
01:04:32,091 --> 01:04:33,140
Speaker 0: Well video was low-quality.

933
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:33,723
Speaker 1: Well the video.

934
01:04:33,763 --> 01:04:36,920
Speaker 1: when it was at a hundred percent the video would stutter to the point that it wasn't working.

935
01:04:37,461 --> 01:04:45,263
Speaker 1: I got the CPU below a hundred a few times, but then the encoding quality was so bad, you know, like Really crap.

936
01:04:45,303 --> 01:04:45,785
Speaker 0: What have you said?

937
01:04:45,825 --> 01:04:48,115
Speaker 0: It's like 720p 30 like it couldn't.

938
01:04:48,276 --> 01:04:49,140
Speaker 0: it couldn't keep up with that.

939
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,286
Speaker 1: No, I couldn't keep up with that.

940
01:04:50,568 --> 01:04:51,553
Speaker 1: It just could not.

941
01:04:51,614 --> 01:04:52,760
Speaker 0: that's like the minimum, right?

942
01:04:52,940 --> 01:05:03,800
Speaker 1: Well, partly I can't output less than 1080p on the HDMI that comes out of my camera raw because no one has a use case for that Mmm, so like it won't do that which would be fine.

943
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:07,820
Speaker 1: This device should be able to handle that and it technically would stream video.

944
01:05:08,181 --> 01:05:15,910
Speaker 1: But I think the encoding software is bullshitty because the RTMP server Couldn't auto detect the resolution of what it was outputting.

945
01:05:15,951 --> 01:05:16,633
Speaker 1: like it works.

946
01:05:16,814 --> 01:05:27,980
Speaker 1: when I consumed it in OBS But the RTMP server showed a weird resolution like it like something's wrong with the like the how it was encoding I didn't get to the point of wire sharking it to figure out what was wrong because I didn't care anymore.

947
01:05:28,423 --> 01:05:37,420
Speaker 0: I've already mailed this thing back into that at a refund Yeah, but I think my solution is if I ever ever want to stream from on the go, right?

948
01:05:37,781 --> 01:05:40,590
Speaker 0: I'm going to probably just stream from my phone.

949
01:05:40,831 --> 01:05:41,252
Speaker 0: Yep, right?

950
01:05:41,493 --> 01:05:42,336
Speaker 0: They'll be like phone.

951
01:05:42,396 --> 01:05:43,680
Speaker 0: start streaming, right?

952
01:05:44,721 --> 01:05:51,160
Speaker 1: By an HDMI input card to plug my camera into or I'm gonna buy like a multi-thousand dollar version of this from a company.

953
01:05:51,221 --> 01:05:52,492
Speaker 1: That isn't bootleg nonsense.

954
01:05:53,077 --> 01:05:57,839
Speaker 1: Oh good I gave it one star and I lit into how shitty this thing is.

955
01:05:58,301 --> 01:06:03,458
Speaker 0: I feel like I would give something like that based on your description to star only because it did work.

956
01:06:04,342 --> 01:06:06,500
Speaker 0: Right, like the web interface worked it did its thing.

957
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:10,820
Speaker 1: It was just really slow and but even if you get it working it encodes.

958
01:06:11,162 --> 01:06:22,420
Speaker 1: It does not actually encode h.264 correctly Like the iframes are all messed up and like it has so many encoding artifacts and it it's weird what it's doing.

959
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:24,998
Speaker 1: I could not get it to behave deterministically.

960
01:06:26,503 --> 01:06:29,139
Speaker 1: It also got so hot that it scalded me so I didn't trust it.

961
01:06:30,322 --> 01:06:34,518
Speaker 1: Like literally I have a red burn on my wrist from bumping into it while I was testing it.

962
01:06:35,502 --> 01:06:37,209
Speaker 0: So everyone out there it took me so long.

963
01:06:37,269 --> 01:06:41,766
Speaker 0: if you're wondering how people doing these fancy streams This is how they're doing it, right?

964
01:06:41,826 --> 01:06:45,820
Speaker 0: They're not using some sort of physical switcher in the real world like a professional?

965
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:50,529
Speaker 0: Yeah, no video people would do it I don't know.

966
01:06:51,813 --> 01:07:00,427
Speaker 0: think about like the truck out behind the sports stadium Right where they're choosing which screens to play and they have a million cameras people who are live streaming on Twitch and YouTube.

967
01:07:00,467 --> 01:07:20,773
Speaker 0: the way they're doing it is all the different cameras are streaming to a centralized RTMP server and then someone with a centralized OBS is Choosing which ones go live and that RTMP server is sort of replacing the truck that's behind the sports stadium And you're replacing the HDMI cables with RTMP streams.

968
01:07:21,094 --> 01:07:22,620
Speaker 0: So it streams on streams on streams.

969
01:07:23,044 --> 01:07:23,873
Speaker 0: I know that's the way it's done

970
01:07:23,954 --> 01:07:42,433
Speaker 1: and frankly If you learn how to make that work Other than the underlying technology like the server you're using as opposed to say like hardware encoders and running real cables and stuff The reality is you'll learn like messing with OBS in that format Like you'll learn all the skills you need to work in one of those trucks.

971
01:07:42,534 --> 01:07:47,660
Speaker 1: like it's the same pipeline It's just different on infrastructure to drive that pipeline.

972
01:07:48,021 --> 01:07:53,399
Speaker 0: You can also get people who are streamers maybe popular ones who aren't good at technology to like pay you to help them out.

973
01:07:54,041 --> 01:07:59,880
Speaker 0: Yep, because good lord people already in that industry, but there's still obviously room to move into that an industry.

974
01:08:00,102 --> 01:08:12,354
Speaker 1: I've tried to watch a lot of people who are Ostensibly professionals in this space with their own live streams during the quarantine because a lot of professional entertainers are trying to live stream from home and Yeah, they don't know how to make any of this stuff work.

975
01:08:12,998 --> 01:08:14,883
Speaker 0: No We only just learned it.

976
01:08:15,445 --> 01:08:17,872
Speaker 1: Yep, but the point is it did not take long.

977
01:08:17,993 --> 01:08:19,920
Speaker 1: RTMP is like not hard.

978
01:08:20,041 --> 01:08:22,898
Speaker 1: You just have to understand all these sort of VIP.

979
01:08:23,582 --> 01:08:26,359
Speaker 0: Well, you got to know TCP IP and you got to know all the stuff around streaming.

980
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:28,899
Speaker 1: Like you got to know how video works like on a basic level.

981
01:08:28,961 --> 01:08:34,066
Speaker 1: You got to know how like encoders work on a basic level got to know how Microphones work on a basic level.

982
01:08:34,086 --> 01:08:40,209
Speaker 1: like you need to have all these basic pieces and then you can use this technology To stitch them all together, which is the last mile.

983
01:08:40,832 --> 01:08:40,992
Speaker 0: Yeah.

984
01:08:41,354 --> 01:08:41,635
