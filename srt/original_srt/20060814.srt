1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,610
Speaker 3: It's Monday August 14th, and this is geek nights.

2
00:00:13,131 --> 00:00:14,957
Speaker 3: tonight after an almost two-week hiatus.

3
00:00:14,997 --> 00:00:17,760
Speaker 3: We bring you our live podcasting panel from Otacon.

4
00:00:20,162 --> 00:00:21,197
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:22,144 --> 00:00:25,199
Speaker 3: Well after almost two weeks of hiatus geek nights is back.

6
00:00:25,983 --> 00:00:33,710
Speaker 2: Beware we live we hunger Run coward run run run see.

7
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,820
Speaker 3: I thought about putting the actual wav files in but that was so much more fun.

8
00:00:37,101 --> 00:00:41,375
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess you can put them in near the end of the episode for funnies or randomly throughout.

9
00:00:41,756 --> 00:00:49,039
Speaker 3: ooh also funnies But anyway for anyone who isn't aware Meaning mostly people who may be new listeners since we seem to have a lot of you.

10
00:00:49,702 --> 00:00:57,480
Speaker 3: We were at Otacon and Wildwood and Atlantic City and Beacon for the last two weeks pretty much collecting content for podcasting.

11
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:03,138
Speaker 3: We have enough content to do the next three weeks handily.

12
00:01:03,158 --> 00:01:06,140
Speaker 2: at this point I'd say we have enough content to the next three months.

13
00:01:08,086 --> 00:01:12,360
Speaker 3: Now instead of doing one or two massive massive episodes are going really long all week.

14
00:01:13,042 --> 00:01:13,163
Speaker 0: The

15
00:01:13,203 --> 00:01:19,314
Speaker 3: plan is that we are just going to use all of these stories from Otacon and the week of awesome Throughout the next several weeks as we

16
00:01:19,355 --> 00:01:19,677
Speaker 0: see fit

17
00:01:21,021 --> 00:01:27,460
Speaker 2: Which means you are in store for many many entertaining episodes of geek nights instead of one incredibly stupid long one

18
00:01:27,842 --> 00:01:36,320
Speaker 3: Now for all of you who are looking for our Otacon coverage or all of that business We are going to have our main Otacon con report this Wednesday on anime manga comics day.

19
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:40,013
Speaker 2: Tomorrow we're gonna talk about just the gaming that

20
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,440
Speaker 1: we did over the past two weeks

21
00:01:41,741 --> 00:01:42,323
Speaker 2: I think right

22
00:01:42,444 --> 00:01:51,080
Speaker 3: which was mostly the gaming room at the con that we did check out and play a bunch of games in and Then playing DDR for pretty much three days non-stop in Wildwood.

23
00:01:51,582 --> 00:01:54,073
Speaker 2: We also played some D&D for a bit.

24
00:01:54,454 --> 00:01:55,820
Speaker 3: sure we did a bit, but we fell asleep.

25
00:01:56,901 --> 00:01:58,606
Speaker 3: It's right about halfway through the one shot.

26
00:01:58,847 --> 00:02:01,615
Speaker 3: yeah right after we fought and failed to kill that dragon.

27
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:02,597
Speaker 2: good job.

28
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:06,718
Speaker 2: Thursday We will reveal the new motto of the front row crew.

29
00:02:06,858 --> 00:02:13,460
Speaker 3: yes We will have to give mad props to the two people who are somewhat together responsible for the new motto the front row crew.

30
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,670
Speaker 3: But suffice to say we enacted the motto to its fullest.

31
00:02:16,811 --> 00:02:25,530
Speaker 3: we have done not one not one, but two Um Dumb things that are going to be all over the internet.

32
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,492
Speaker 3: I guarantee it.

33
00:02:26,974 --> 00:02:34,260
Speaker 2: Hopefully we can use the Incredible internet popularity of the dumb things we have done to bring in new listeners.

34
00:02:34,542 --> 00:02:36,050
Speaker 3: I mean honestly we did these things.

35
00:02:36,292 --> 00:02:37,780
Speaker 3: just they're the kind of things we would do anyway.

36
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,210
Speaker 3: We found them hilarious, but then afterward we realized that they're exactly the things we always see on Boing.

37
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:53,738
Speaker 2: Boing Yeah I mean the other day I was going around the internet, and I saw a link to a blog story about leet license plates.

38
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:55,708
Speaker 2: hello I have a leet license plate.

39
00:02:55,748 --> 00:02:59,187
Speaker 3: you have the most basic leet license And why wasn't I on there?

40
00:02:59,267 --> 00:03:01,679
Speaker 3: what the hell you're also in one of the most populous states.

41
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,955
Speaker 3: Yeah, the fact that no one got that before you I guess.

42
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,100
Speaker 2: oh well I was neglected.

43
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:13,318
Speaker 2: But we will generate two awesomes to counteract my lack of leet license plate.

44
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:24,880
Speaker 3: knowing Now if you notice that I particularly sound a lot different than usual one We completely lost our voices at Otacon as in Scott, and I could not talk at all.

45
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:27,306
Speaker 2: Now you're going today.

46
00:03:27,326 --> 00:03:32,486
Speaker 2: what we have for you is actually a recording of our Otacon panel Which was Sunday morning.

47
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,900
Speaker 2: now we lost our voices sometime around the middle of Saturday.

48
00:03:35,944 --> 00:03:45,871
Speaker 3: Yes We drugged ourselves with the halls and menthol in order to actually do the show and it was painful as in the moment the panel Was over I couldn't talk at all anymore.

49
00:03:46,032 --> 00:03:55,517
Speaker 2: Yes, so thanks to the halls of medicine We did our panel and thus destroyed our throats and vocal cords Which is part of the reason why the panel is going to sound bad now?

50
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,238
Speaker 3: Additionally we'll talk about the rest of the problems with the panel recording when we actually play it.

51
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:11,422
Speaker 3: yeah Yeah, additionally you might notice that I sound different because my pop filter Which I brought to Otacon to show to all of the other podcasts is nice homemade Embroidery loop.

52
00:04:11,983 --> 00:04:16,094
Speaker 3: yes the one that was featured on the creative mom podcast the same.

53
00:04:16,615 --> 00:04:18,519
Speaker 3: it has been lost somewhere.

54
00:04:18,861 --> 00:04:24,460
Speaker 3: Therefore I'm currently angling the microphone oddly in order to minimize the popping that I normally make.

55
00:04:25,382 --> 00:04:25,823
Speaker 2: Good job.

56
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:30,019
Speaker 3: Yeah, so I'm gonna have to stop somewhere and buy a new pop filter sometime soon.

57
00:04:31,081 --> 00:04:40,248
Speaker 2: Yeah, we'll probably buy those new microphones that the audio guy at Otacon told us to get and then we'll buy pop filters for them Yes, or buy more embroidery loops.

58
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:43,380
Speaker 3: also the fact that the audio guy at Otacon laughed at our mixer.

59
00:04:43,521 --> 00:04:44,673
Speaker 3: We're going to upgrade the mixer.

60
00:04:44,976 --> 00:04:50,865
Speaker 2: Yeah Yeah, especially since there's nothing really wrong with the mixer itself except It doesn't have enough holes.

61
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:53,355
Speaker 3: we used all of them at Otacon.

62
00:04:53,657 --> 00:04:57,720
Speaker 3: yep in fact We recorded a whole bunch of awesome interviews that are going to be played all week.

63
00:04:58,163 --> 00:05:01,363
Speaker 3: We also survived an assassination attempt Which will be.

64
00:05:01,825 --> 00:05:05,120
Speaker 3: we actually have audio of that which will be played at some point in the next two weeks.

65
00:05:05,382 --> 00:05:07,036
Speaker 2: Yeah, probably a week from Wednesday.

66
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,551
Speaker 3: I'm guessing Fucking clown pistols.

67
00:05:09,773 --> 00:05:12,303
Speaker 2: Oh my god All right.

68
00:05:12,925 --> 00:05:13,145
Speaker 3: All right.

69
00:05:13,206 --> 00:05:16,597
Speaker 3: Anyway to not go too on about all of our crazy stuff.

70
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:17,520
Speaker 3: That'll come during the week.

71
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:18,859
Speaker 3: We have the news as usual.

72
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:23,760
Speaker 2: Wow, there was a lot of news in the past two weeks that we didn't talk about at all.

73
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,342
Speaker 2: And you know what?

74
00:05:24,764 --> 00:05:29,440
Speaker 2: I didn't even bother to go back on dig to see every news story of the past two weeks.

75
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,536
Speaker 3: Yeah, I basically just picked out the one that kind of stood out in my head.

76
00:05:32,737 --> 00:05:33,682
Speaker 2: and yeah This is.

77
00:05:33,722 --> 00:05:39,210
Speaker 2: this is the time when podcasts like twit come in handy, you know, cuz they're weekly They just summarize the whole week.

78
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:45,097
Speaker 3: So listening to two twits today I was completely caught up even though that's what all of you seem to want us to turn geek nights into.

79
00:05:45,117 --> 00:05:46,343
Speaker 2: yeah It's like what.

80
00:05:46,484 --> 00:05:49,500
Speaker 2: if you want to listen to it, seriously, just listen it to it.

81
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,759
Speaker 3: I do note that most of the people who suggest that said that they like us more than they like to it.

82
00:05:54,382 --> 00:05:59,320
Speaker 2: Some of the people yeah, but how come twit has a whole jillion listeners and we don't ah, we'll get on that.

83
00:05:59,621 --> 00:06:00,544
Speaker 3: Yeah, all right.

84
00:06:00,584 --> 00:06:04,277
Speaker 3: So mine's real simple because I don't think I need to do much commentary on this.

85
00:06:04,317 --> 00:06:07,916
Speaker 3: This is pretty Obvious now self-explanatory.

86
00:06:08,057 --> 00:06:12,998
Speaker 3: Sony Kinda sucks and blu-ray has pretty much been a train wreck from the start.

87
00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:21,042
Speaker 3: now recently the blu-ray drives the first of the blu-ray drives have come out and Alright cool.

88
00:06:21,985 --> 00:06:38,778
Speaker 3: It came to the attention of the internet that these drives cannot actually play commercially released blu-ray discs due to problems with the copyright and DRM stuff and as well due to problems with the software and The fact that HDCP does not really work on computers.

89
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:38,979
Speaker 3: yet.

90
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:52,500
Speaker 2: Basically the way it is you buy a blu-ray drive for your computer because you want to burn blu-ray discs play Blu-ray movies on your computer something whatever you want to do store data on them because they're marginally larger.

91
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,432
Speaker 2: Maybe you have a blu-ray disc and you want to play.

92
00:06:55,894 --> 00:06:57,180
Speaker 2: you want to get data off of it.

93
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,939
Speaker 2: It's a data blu-ray disc and put it on your computer except no one has those.

94
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:04,511
Speaker 3: yet The only blu-ray discs are commercially released movies that don't work.

95
00:07:04,652 --> 00:07:07,040
Speaker 3: on the only drives that exist right now.

96
00:07:07,523 --> 00:07:20,980
Speaker 2: The drive can play the movies But what it does is it requires that you have this DRM called HDCP which is high definition content protection in your video card and I think even in your monitor, right?

97
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:29,880
Speaker 3: Yes now to the best of my knowledge unless something's changed or I haven't googled around too closely There don't appear to be any video cards that have HDCP support.

98
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:36,380
Speaker 2: There were many that said they had HDCP support over HDCP ready, but none of them actually were.

99
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:42,499
Speaker 3: Yeah, so if you want a blu-ray drive don't buy one they don't work.

100
00:07:43,424 --> 00:07:54,040
Speaker 2: Well, you can buy one as long as you know that in the future You're going to have to buy a new video card that has this DRM in it and a new monitor that has this DRM in it.

101
00:07:54,683 --> 00:08:02,600
Speaker 3: If that even comes to pass or if they don't change HDCP or if they don't just completely redo the format or all the other possible problems.

102
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:16,760
Speaker 2: Yeah it's like you need to have a video card that has DRM a monitor that has DRM a special cable and then This blu-ray drive and some of those things exist and some of those things don't or at least they're not all commercially available.

103
00:08:17,641 --> 00:08:24,660
Speaker 2: therefore it Effectively the D hit the blu-ray drive for your computer cannot play blu-ray movies.

104
00:08:25,462 --> 00:08:28,040
Speaker 3: So I hate to be the Deadpool dead horse, and I'm not gonna go.

105
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,900
Speaker 3: I'm really not gonna talk about blu-ray again because there's.

106
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:33,323
Speaker 3: It's kind of like Jack Thompson.

107
00:08:33,344 --> 00:08:38,078
Speaker 3: Yeah, I only talk about blu-ray or Jack Thompson if they top themselves somehow.

108
00:08:38,803 --> 00:08:41,597
Speaker 2: And so a lot of Jack Thompson lately, but it's nothing out of the ordinary.

109
00:08:41,616 --> 00:08:42,200
Speaker 3: It's nothing new.

110
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,768
Speaker 3: He's just been in the news more.

111
00:08:43,928 --> 00:08:44,250
Speaker 3: Yeah.

112
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:44,471
Speaker 3: Yes.

113
00:08:44,531 --> 00:08:48,899
Speaker 3: I mean he would have to pretty much kill a baby For me to talk about him, didn't he?

114
00:08:51,184 --> 00:08:53,700
Speaker 3: Yeah, but I I'm very much.

115
00:08:53,820 --> 00:09:01,298
Speaker 3: I'm pretty much 90% certain that blu-ray as a format is going to fail and That I was about 80% certain until this news came out.

116
00:09:01,681 --> 00:09:04,294
Speaker 3: So we'll see if anything can make that percentage ever go down again.

117
00:09:04,937 --> 00:09:06,745
Speaker 2: We'll see All right.

118
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:10,766
Speaker 2: So also in the news What was my news again?

119
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:11,710
Speaker 3: Good job.

120
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:12,433
Speaker 3: Good.

121
00:09:12,473 --> 00:09:14,200
Speaker 3: You finally get back after two weeks.

122
00:09:14,662 --> 00:09:17,537
Speaker 2: I just reminded myself like two minutes ago of what it was.

123
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,085
Speaker 2: Oh Right the RAA.

124
00:09:20,587 --> 00:09:21,790
Speaker 2: Oh they exist.

125
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,619
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're still around doing stupid shit and they're suing people as always.

126
00:09:26,502 --> 00:09:31,435
Speaker 2: So they sued this guy and while they were suing this guy he died.

127
00:09:31,756 --> 00:09:33,300
Speaker 3: He suddenly died of an aneurysm.

128
00:09:33,622 --> 00:09:38,031
Speaker 2: Yep, so they said ah shit How are we gonna sue a dead man?

129
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:40,080
Speaker 3: You know what they're going to sue a dead man.

130
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:52,299
Speaker 3: They're continuing with the lawsuit and they're forcing the family He bereaved family including the man's children to submit deposition so that they can that they can then prosecute and then Extract money from his estate.

131
00:09:53,262 --> 00:09:56,160
Speaker 2: Yep, so they basically said alright the guy died.

132
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:59,876
Speaker 2: We'll give you 60 days to mourn on the 61st day.

133
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:04,119
Speaker 2: We want you to come in and give deposition so that we can take his money.

134
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,378
Speaker 3: um, I don't know what to say to that.

135
00:10:07,418 --> 00:10:10,940
Speaker 3: that's That's the worst PR move in the world.

136
00:10:11,302 --> 00:10:19,937
Speaker 3: I mean they've already sued old ladies young kids single moms College students and now they're suing a dead man and they're making his children testify against it.

137
00:10:19,957 --> 00:10:20,840
Speaker 2: Well, I mean think about this.

138
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,794
Speaker 2: Let's say you had a legitimate lawsuit against someone like a really legitimate one.

139
00:10:24,934 --> 00:10:27,603
Speaker 2: say, I don't know What's something you would see.

140
00:10:27,643 --> 00:10:32,700
Speaker 3: you stole a million dollars from me straight up by violating a contract and then you died.

141
00:10:33,161 --> 00:10:33,663
Speaker 2: There you go.

142
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,147
Speaker 3: I should be able to get that money back.

143
00:10:35,307 --> 00:10:44,080
Speaker 2: You should but sometimes, you know, if it's not a big deal Even though you have a legitimate case, you'll let it go because the guy died.

144
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:47,935
Speaker 3: Yeah, I mean the RIAA obviously is not suing people to get money.

145
00:10:48,035 --> 00:10:49,340
Speaker 3: getting money is just a byproduct.

146
00:10:49,701 --> 00:10:58,188
Speaker 3: They're suing people in order to scare people into not downloading things which isn't working at all - they've never actually won a lawsuit.

147
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,459
Speaker 3: They just get people to settle and everyone who's ever fought them has won.

148
00:11:01,479 --> 00:11:06,580
Speaker 3: and Three they're not going to scare any more people by continuing to sue this dead daddy.

149
00:11:07,144 --> 00:11:09,479
Speaker 3: All they're going to do is piss more people off.

150
00:11:10,122 --> 00:11:19,657
Speaker 2: all I can hope is that because of the attention brought to this case of Where the guy died that some of those lawyers who won cases for other people will go help.

151
00:11:19,698 --> 00:11:23,419
Speaker 2: these people Prevent the RIAA from taking money from the estate.

152
00:11:24,681 --> 00:11:30,680
Speaker 2: Because I'm thinking what the RIAA is thinking is that hey look there's an estate and no one to defend it.

153
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:35,540
Speaker 2: Maybe we can loot it and they won't feel bad because they're looting a dead man who isn't there to care.

154
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,747
Speaker 3: I don't think they're thinking that at all.

155
00:11:36,828 --> 00:11:46,441
Speaker 3: I think very simply they'll just sue anyone They have a case against I don't know and then if the person fights back They'll probably just immediately drop the suit as they tend to do Whatever.

156
00:11:46,823 --> 00:11:47,445
Speaker 2: They're evil.

157
00:11:47,586 --> 00:11:49,332
Speaker 2: They're more evil every day.

158
00:11:49,353 --> 00:11:51,320
Speaker 2: They haven't let up, you know.

159
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,638
Speaker 3: Wow, so the news today was Sony is incompetent and the RIAA is evil.

160
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,982
Speaker 2: Seems like nothing much changed while we were away for two weeks.

161
00:12:00,062 --> 00:12:00,803
Speaker 2: Fantastic.

162
00:12:07,568 --> 00:12:08,969
Speaker 2: Things of the past two weeks.

163
00:12:09,349 --> 00:12:12,870
Speaker 3: Things of the day Alright for all of our new listeners.

164
00:12:13,613 --> 00:12:24,710
Speaker 3: We're not gonna annoy all of our current listeners as we have in the past when we get a bunch of new listeners by explaining The entire show every day for an entire week, but I think it warrants explanation that what we're about to do is something we do.

165
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:30,647
Speaker 3: it's a bit on every show where we Show you and then talk about whatever thing we found on the internet in the last 24 hours.

166
00:12:31,371 --> 00:12:34,309
Speaker 3: That was awesome enough to share with anyone on the internet.

167
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,677
Speaker 2: It's probably something you've already seen.

168
00:12:36,717 --> 00:12:40,550
Speaker 2: if you're the type of person who reads lots of websites like dig and slash

169
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:47,850
Speaker 3: Many of our listeners do not do these things and they're often new and sometimes our listeners send us things that we have not seen

170
00:12:48,492 --> 00:12:49,154
Speaker 2: Very rarely

171
00:12:49,476 --> 00:12:51,302
Speaker 3: maybe once or twice ever though actually

172
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:52,266
Speaker 0: over

173
00:12:52,326 --> 00:13:03,232
Speaker 3: the week of awesome Which actually we'll talk about in great detail on Thursday because that's where all the hijinks took place Our friend showed us a good number of things that we had missed over the course of the internet that we are now going to Share.

174
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:13,270
Speaker 2: yep, and you know sometimes, you know I think the real point of the thing of the day is that We're gonna tell you about cool things on the internet that you'll probably find out about in a couple weeks.

175
00:13:13,651 --> 00:13:20,718
Speaker 2: But since you find out about them now you kind of keep pace with us a little bit plus You know you get all of our witty commentary.

176
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:22,686
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's really all about the witty commentary.

177
00:13:22,947 --> 00:13:25,339
Speaker 3: So this video I forget who exactly showed it to us.

178
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:30,542
Speaker 3: It was either Jess or Yuko, I believe I don't actually remember because I walked into the room and it was playing.

179
00:13:31,265 --> 00:13:37,690
Speaker 3: it's called dad's home And it is this cute awesome animation kind of reminds me of the Perry Bible Fellowship.

180
00:13:38,612 --> 00:13:46,570
Speaker 3: yeah, and it's just a father comes home and Goes on a destructive rampage, and then he saves the day by rocking out hard.

181
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:49,058
Speaker 3: I can't describe it any other way other than that.

182
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,704
Speaker 3: It is exactly my kind of humor.

183
00:13:50,824 --> 00:13:52,410
Speaker 2: Wow that was some witty commentary.

184
00:13:52,793 --> 00:13:58,002
Speaker 2: It's so worth listening to this show Because they couldn't figure that out just by watching it.

185
00:13:58,624 --> 00:14:10,369
Speaker 3: well the thing is it's it's that humor That's kind of offbeat and hard to follow like the guy's head catches on fire randomly and then self referentially and then he gets isolated laser eyes for no reason.

186
00:14:11,672 --> 00:14:14,650
Speaker 3: So one if you're a fan of the Perry Bible Fellowship watch this video.

187
00:14:15,252 --> 00:14:17,640
Speaker 2: If you're not a fan of Perry Bible Fellowship go read it.

188
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,750
Speaker 3: if you like this video go read the Perry Bible Fellowship.

189
00:14:20,851 --> 00:14:27,669
Speaker 2: Go read the Perry Bible Fellowship No matter what if you can read the English language even if you can't read the English language.

190
00:14:28,311 --> 00:14:38,627
Speaker 3: Though on a completely side note that I'll talk about again whenever we do playback the our webcomic roundtable that we did at Otacon I might have added a new webcomic to my list of webcomics.

191
00:14:39,109 --> 00:14:40,938
Speaker 3: Oh Yeah, cuz I've known.

192
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,950
Speaker 3: you know I've met Michael Mookie.

193
00:14:43,691 --> 00:14:44,113
Speaker 3: I don't know.

194
00:14:44,153 --> 00:14:51,454
Speaker 3: actually I'd never known his last name until just now when I'm looking at the book in front of me, but Dominic Deegan Oracle for Hire I'd never read.

195
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,523
Speaker 3: I just kind of knew the guy who wrote it.

196
00:14:53,644 --> 00:15:01,884
Speaker 3: as in I ran into my cons all the time And you go gave me the book of the first I guess season of his webcomic, and I think for the first time since dr.

197
00:15:01,924 --> 00:15:02,366
Speaker 3: McNinja.

198
00:15:02,426 --> 00:15:03,609
Speaker 3: I'm going to read a new webcomic.

199
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:07,318
Speaker 3: Only thought of that because of Perry Bible Fellowship.

200
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,869
Speaker 2: I think it's a good enough time to say mad props to the dr.

201
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,544
Speaker 2: McNinja cosplayer at Otacon.

202
00:15:11,725 --> 00:15:16,668
Speaker 2: Oh, yes I think I was the only one who recognized his costume because I walked out to him like are you dr.

203
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:20,890
Speaker 2: McNinja, and he was like oh, yeah, and we shook hands, and he was all good time.

204
00:15:21,051 --> 00:15:23,102
Speaker 3: He reacted exactly the way he should have.

205
00:15:23,303 --> 00:15:25,556
Speaker 2: there was a picture of him in my flicker So you go check that out.

206
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:26,462
Speaker 3: definitely good in fact.

207
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:33,230
Speaker 3: go check out the flicker And you might be able to surmise Some of the things that have gone on that we were going to be talking about over the next two weeks.

208
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:38,670
Speaker 2: You'll probably be able to surmise more from our friends flickers than from ours because I don't take very many pictures.

209
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:47,580
Speaker 3: Yeah though all of you who are savvy to the forums will probably easily find the other flicker that has the pictures of us doing the Dumb things we did last week.

210
00:15:47,801 --> 00:15:54,850
Speaker 2: Yeah, the things we will talk about Thursday All right my thing of the day is I'm sure everyone has seen this by now because it's at the top of YouTube.

211
00:15:56,391 --> 00:16:04,283
Speaker 2: It's an old man on YouTube like a 79 year old man, and he's from Britain Which is awesome because that means he talks in a cool way.

212
00:16:04,303 --> 00:16:05,832
Speaker 3: is he actually 79 Or did you?

213
00:16:05,872 --> 00:16:07,738
Speaker 2: he really is like 79 years old.

214
00:16:07,778 --> 00:16:09,925
Speaker 3: you keep saying like is he or is he not 79 79 years old, okay?

215
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:29,444
Speaker 2: And because you said like 79 lies in he's like 80 or he's like 90, but the fact that you used 79 specifically 79 years old okay I think what the deal was is YouTube profile says 78, but in one of the videos He says 79. so he must have joined YouTube before his birthday.

216
00:16:29,584 --> 00:16:30,468
Speaker 3: damn you internet.

217
00:16:30,648 --> 00:16:40,109
Speaker 2: Yeah Anyway this old guy apparently he used to be a biker but not he doesn't have tattoos or anything and he used to be pretty hardcore.

218
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:59,190
Speaker 2: and now he's an old man in Britain and he likes blues music which is awesome because I like blues music and he likes YouTube and he's one of the few old people who actually knows enough to Go on YouTube and look at stuff, and he thinks it's really cool that all the cool videos that young people are making.

219
00:17:00,055 --> 00:17:16,069
Speaker 2: So he decided that he would try to make a YouTube video and he pretty much set up a webcam and he played some blues music and He talked about being an old cranky guy And he figures he'll impart some of his old man wisdom onto the YouTube kids out there.

220
00:17:16,431 --> 00:17:22,628
Speaker 2: I have so much respect for this man, and he succeeds in becoming the most popular thing on YouTube.

221
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:27,219
Speaker 3: I mean 79. think about how old that is.

222
00:17:27,661 --> 00:17:35,130
Speaker 3: think about how different the world was when he was a punk kid and Now he's managed to get on YouTube and become stupid pop.

223
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:38,627
Speaker 3: I mean, I know a lot of people my age who couldn't get on YouTube.

224
00:17:38,889 --> 00:17:39,029
Speaker 1: yep

225
00:17:39,473 --> 00:17:57,937
Speaker 2: So I've linked you to his first video Which is called first try and there's a lot of comments and a lot of there even videos people have put up in response To this video, but he also if you go to the guy's YouTube page Which I can't seem to find because I don't know how to use YouTube There is you can see all the videos.

226
00:17:57,978 --> 00:17:58,519
Speaker 2: He's made.

227
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,226
Speaker 2: He's got like episodes going on.

228
00:18:00,386 --> 00:18:02,955
Speaker 2: It's sort of like a. It's more like a vlog.

229
00:18:03,396 --> 00:18:04,800
Speaker 2: you know a vlog.

230
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,502
Speaker 3: I like that.

231
00:18:05,582 --> 00:18:06,304
Speaker 2: It's a vlog.

232
00:18:06,425 --> 00:18:11,742
Speaker 2: That's a terrible word that should never be you I know, but that's the most accurate word for what this old man is making.

233
00:18:11,843 --> 00:18:15,718
Speaker 3: you know what you're allowed to say vlog because I've Said blog o sphere more than once

234
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,401
Speaker 2: all right,

235
00:18:16,522 --> 00:18:17,727
Speaker 3: and I said pot is fear once -

236
00:18:17,747 --> 00:18:17,968
Speaker 1: yeah

237
00:18:18,571 --> 00:18:27,730
Speaker 2: I normally wouldn't say vlog for something like ask a ninja or whatever But this is a vlog an awesome old man vlog that is deservedly at the top of YouTube.

238
00:18:28,573 --> 00:18:33,130
Speaker 3: All right now before we go into the podcasting panel at Otacon first off a bunch of meta bits.

239
00:18:33,632 --> 00:18:38,390
Speaker 3: Stay tuned once again all this week for all of our Otacon and Wildwood and Atlantic City coverage.

240
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:41,383
Speaker 3: We have so many funny stories to tell.

241
00:18:41,403 --> 00:18:44,677
Speaker 2: you have no idea Not a single idea.

242
00:18:44,738 --> 00:18:47,570
Speaker 2: unless you were with us, then you already know all these stories.

243
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:48,876
Speaker 3: We did some dangerous things.

244
00:18:49,218 --> 00:18:51,890
Speaker 3: we gambled and won a decent sum of money.

245
00:18:52,311 --> 00:18:53,054
Speaker 2: Don't give it away.

246
00:18:53,074 --> 00:18:54,861
Speaker 3: Yeah, that wasn't giving anything away.

247
00:18:54,881 --> 00:18:55,765
Speaker 2: I was giving something away.

248
00:18:55,865 --> 00:18:56,950
Speaker 3: It was giving a tiny bit away.

249
00:18:57,793 --> 00:19:00,595
Speaker 2: someone ate something Not someone else.

250
00:19:00,615 --> 00:19:01,781
Speaker 2: the kind of stuff you got to give away.

251
00:19:01,821 --> 00:19:03,409
Speaker 3: someone had something made.

252
00:19:04,912 --> 00:19:05,958
Speaker 2: People bought things.

253
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,306
Speaker 3: yes people bought things.

254
00:19:07,387 --> 00:19:10,138
Speaker 2: indeed People did not buy things.

255
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:13,370
Speaker 3: um some things that were bought involved eyeballs and robots.

256
00:19:14,671 --> 00:19:18,370
Speaker 2: People engaged in activities and said things which were humorous.

257
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,914
Speaker 3: There is a thing that exists.

258
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:25,670
Speaker 3: it is called a clown pistol, and it is weighed heavily on my mind all right, okay?

259
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:27,233
Speaker 3: Now the panel.

260
00:19:27,895 --> 00:19:32,930
Speaker 3: we were asked to do a poll actually we asked to do and then Otacon said this is a great idea.

261
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:41,378
Speaker 3: Please do it a panel on podcasting as in how to listen to podcast what they are how to do them And all that sort of thing at Otacon this year,

262
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:48,150
Speaker 2: and it was scheduled for Sunday morning, which means Everyone is checking out at their hotels and isn't going to come to your panel.

263
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,505
Speaker 2: But regardless of that like a good number of people showed up.

264
00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:54,075
Speaker 3: Yeah, it was also Interestingly enough scheduled.

265
00:19:54,195 --> 00:20:01,222
Speaker 3: I mean there are four panel rooms at Otacon this year two of which are the standard panel rooms one of which is like the tiny panel room.

266
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:05,677
Speaker 3: they give to unpopular things and They put us in the panel room.

267
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,563
Speaker 3: that was pretty much massive.

268
00:20:07,743 --> 00:20:09,008
Speaker 3: I would use the word ginormous.

269
00:20:09,048 --> 00:20:16,790
Speaker 2: Yes this year They've destroyed main events They what used to be main events which is this tremendous ballroom on the top floor of the Convention Center.

270
00:20:17,452 --> 00:20:28,745
Speaker 2: They removed that entirely because the only reason they had main events was for the cosplay and they didn't really Anything else they used it for did not use even half the space of main events now.

271
00:20:28,825 --> 00:20:30,470
Speaker 3: This may not happen next year.

272
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,276
Speaker 2: Yeah, we don't know.

273
00:20:31,336 --> 00:20:31,739
Speaker 2: next year.

274
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,170
Speaker 3: We will have much to say about.

275
00:20:34,157 --> 00:20:38,918
Speaker 3: Yes And on Wednesday we give our general con report.

276
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:44,080
Speaker 2: so because they move main events to the arena down the street They split.

277
00:20:44,181 --> 00:20:44,929
Speaker 2: they split up.

278
00:20:45,513 --> 00:20:47,529
Speaker 2: They moved the cosplay to the arena down the street.

279
00:20:48,071 --> 00:20:55,939
Speaker 2: Main events was split up and they cut it in half and one half of it was theater is now theater one Which is a showing theater for movies and stuff.

280
00:20:56,581 --> 00:20:58,829
Speaker 2: The other half was split in half yet again.

281
00:20:59,652 --> 00:21:01,919
Speaker 2: One of those quarters I think was a video room.

282
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:06,272
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was like video seven or something or video six I don't remember.

283
00:21:06,312 --> 00:21:06,914
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

284
00:21:07,415 --> 00:21:12,430
Speaker 2: but the other quarter so a former quarter of main events became panel four.

285
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:13,614
Speaker 2: Now us.

286
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,644
Speaker 3: there was a massive sound system in there to the point.

287
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:19,448
Speaker 3: now some of its cut out But you can still hear the echo.

288
00:21:20,091 --> 00:21:26,750
Speaker 3: We were on stage with the microphones and it was so loud and echoey that it sounded fine in the place for the audience.

289
00:21:27,312 --> 00:21:32,969
Speaker 3: But because we were on stage we could not actually hear what anyone in the audience was saying to us.

290
00:21:33,451 --> 00:21:38,950
Speaker 2: Yep, so eventually at some point in the podcast we get off the stage and then we can hear people.

291
00:21:39,171 --> 00:21:40,663
Speaker 3: Yes, now there is a feedback.

292
00:21:40,784 --> 00:21:46,106
Speaker 3: at one point I forget who walked in front of the speaker, but he walked in front of the speaker.

293
00:21:46,387 --> 00:21:48,617
Speaker 2: whoever they are They are a fan boy or girl.

294
00:21:48,738 --> 00:21:49,642
Speaker 3: if I listen to it.

295
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:51,130
Speaker 3: I could probably figure out who it was.

296
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,777
Speaker 3: I don't remember now.

297
00:21:52,817 --> 00:21:56,070
Speaker 3: The other part of this is that the audio equipment was very expensive and fancy.

298
00:21:56,634 --> 00:21:58,569
Speaker 3: It was also old and broken.

299
00:21:59,012 --> 00:22:07,686
Speaker 3: So as a result the raw recording of the panel, which sounded really good Otherwise because they used really good microphones and everything was top-notch has this.

300
00:22:10,971 --> 00:22:28,883
Speaker 2: Yeah, basically what happened is there was already existing awesome audio equipment in the panel more than we will ever need for geek nights and we asked the guy the audio engineer in charge of the room if we could have a cable that would you know we could plug into our Mac and our mixer and record from it and he did.

301
00:22:28,963 --> 00:22:37,330
Speaker 3: he gave us a cable but the cable went And there's really nothing to do about it and it was pretty low and it was pretty consistent.

302
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:39,510
Speaker 3: So whatever we decided to record anyway.

303
00:22:40,671 --> 00:22:47,910
Speaker 3: Now the choices in terms of playing this panel back for you were either one leave that noise in which was not what you want.

304
00:22:48,311 --> 00:22:53,410
Speaker 2: No, I tried to listen to it with that noise and it is painful wicked painful.

305
00:22:53,832 --> 00:23:06,693
Speaker 3: Now the other option was to do a simple noise gate wherein I cut out these Whenever no one's talking, but that means that you hear it whenever we talk and it made me sound weird Not good.

306
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:17,127
Speaker 3: the third option which we went with was to basically use the audacity noise reduction thing because while I could have done It manually Scott did not want to sit there for an hour or more while I did it.

307
00:23:17,449 --> 00:23:28,773
Speaker 3: Yep plus I've never done that on such a terrible source of noise before and I removed all of the frequencies that the Was on.

308
00:23:29,295 --> 00:23:32,946
Speaker 3: as a result, we sound slightly like robots and we're slightly echoey.

309
00:23:33,247 --> 00:23:34,050
Speaker 3: Well, the echoes were there.

310
00:23:34,491 --> 00:23:36,216
Speaker 3: I know it's doubly echoey.

311
00:23:36,838 --> 00:23:41,070
Speaker 3: Yes, and so it's it sounds a lot better than some podcasts.

312
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:41,872
Speaker 3: I've listened to it.

313
00:23:42,273 --> 00:23:44,038
Speaker 3: So you can't complain to me about this.

314
00:23:44,078 --> 00:23:56,478
Speaker 2: Yes, your only other option besides a slightly robotic sounding Podcasting panel was to have no Podcasting panel and we would now be talking about something else unprepared.

315
00:23:57,022 --> 00:24:06,187
Speaker 3: now as a result We are going to have next week on Monday a discussion on the difficulties of doing live shows as opposed to recorded shows in our studio.

316
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:16,110
Speaker 3: There's a big difference between performing live and not performing live And there's also a big difference between performing live with your own equipment and performing live with other people's equipment.

317
00:24:17,951 --> 00:24:27,979
Speaker 3: Also, there's a big difference between being well-rested and being hungover with a sore throat a broken voice and a bloodshot eye Two bloodshot eyes here.

318
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:29,570
Speaker 2: Yeah, but no hangover.

319
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:34,770
Speaker 3: So I'll warn you now we sound weird because our voices are completely gone and we've taken drugs in order to be able to speak.

320
00:24:35,771 --> 00:24:41,576
Speaker 3: We are so tired and broken because we had to get up at 6 in the morning to prepare for this and to get out Of our hotel room.

321
00:24:41,596 --> 00:24:42,121
Speaker 3: Mm-hmm.

322
00:24:42,363 --> 00:24:46,058
Speaker 3: We had slept exactly 3.5 hours in the 48 hours prior to this panel.

323
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:53,682
Speaker 3: Yeah Yes now as it despite all that I think it was a pretty good panel.

324
00:24:53,802 --> 00:24:55,610
Speaker 3: It was definitely not our best work.

325
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:57,820
Speaker 3: I was much happier with the podcasting panel.

326
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,286
Speaker 3: We did at Tora con last year.

327
00:24:59,307 --> 00:25:01,316
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm Yeah, that was definitely.

328
00:25:01,437 --> 00:25:02,462
Speaker 2: it was more fun at least.

329
00:25:02,985 --> 00:25:13,689
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, this is fun But I think if they had given us a better time like maybe like Friday late later Friday or earlier Saturday Also, if I hadn't been hungover that would have really helped.

330
00:25:14,226 --> 00:25:17,421
Speaker 2: Yeah Then we could have had more people in there and then it would more exciting.

331
00:25:17,923 --> 00:25:29,111
Speaker 3: now also the one thing that would be nice Is I think instead of doing an informative panel, even though everyone seemed to really like I mean We got a lot of really good questions and a lot of people tried to bother us after the show to ask us more questions Which?

332
00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:31,438
Speaker 3: because at that point we couldn't talk anymore.

333
00:25:31,459 --> 00:25:33,204
Speaker 3: We were unable to answer all of your questions.

334
00:25:33,826 --> 00:25:39,298
Speaker 2: if you have questions Send us email send us an audio Audio also.

335
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:50,748
Speaker 3: Yeah, Odeo is awesome But I think next year we're going to try to do a more less informative more fun panel as in Rim and Scott talk about something unrelated to podcasting loudly for an hour on Friday night.

336
00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:55,759
Speaker 2: Ah Something possibly making fun of hentai And I don't want to do one of those.

337
00:25:55,779 --> 00:26:00,610
Speaker 3: not as in we watch hentai and make fun of it But we get people to come and we make fun of them for liking hentai.

338
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,201
Speaker 2: Mmm, I can think of something better than that.

339
00:26:04,221 --> 00:26:05,730
Speaker 2: It's given a given a year.

340
00:26:05,871 --> 00:26:07,890
Speaker 2: I'm guaranteed to come up with something non anti-relate.

341
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:14,710
Speaker 3: It's got to be something that'll fit into the over 18 late-night crowd at Otacon as opposed to the hungover Sunday morning crowd.

342
00:26:15,484 --> 00:26:15,790
Speaker 2: All right.

343
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:24,210
Speaker 3: And Also the final bit before we play this the other things that we recorded Otacon are a whole bunch of interviews that we're going to Play all throughout the week whenever they're relevant.

344
00:26:24,872 --> 00:26:30,990
Speaker 3: We did a webcomics roundtable with a whole bunch of webcomic artists and it turned out really well.

345
00:26:31,613 --> 00:26:34,608
Speaker 3: all I have to do is do stuff to it and then we'll play it probably next week.

346
00:26:34,629 --> 00:26:41,649
Speaker 3: and We recorded a short roundtable with the folks at anime world order and the folks at ninja consultant and who else was there?

347
00:26:42,713 --> 00:26:43,837
Speaker 2: Fast karate for the gentle.

348
00:26:43,878 --> 00:26:46,990
Speaker 3: Yes, we will be playing that probably next Wednesday.

349
00:26:47,371 --> 00:26:56,438
Speaker 2: Yes, if you visit all of those podcasts the anime world order the ninja consultant and the fast karate for the gentleman Those are like the primary podcasters.

350
00:26:56,478 --> 00:27:04,646
Speaker 2: We were down with at the con so their latest Episodes have stuff possibly relating to us that you might be interested in.

351
00:27:04,866 --> 00:27:08,654
Speaker 3: Yes, and during the next week We will have stuff related to all of them Mm-hmm.

352
00:27:09,015 --> 00:27:23,034
Speaker 3: So thus without further ado and once again, I apologize This is as good as I could make this sound the Monday after the week of awesome the podcasting and internet radio panel from Otacon 2006.

353
00:27:23,034 --> 00:27:23,177
Speaker 1: whoo.

354
00:27:24,573 --> 00:27:26,222
Speaker 0: Well, we've got a stellar crowd here.

355
00:27:26,262 --> 00:27:27,649
Speaker 0: So I suppose we will just begin.

356
00:27:29,671 --> 00:27:35,048
Speaker 0: My name is rim, I'm Scott and we are the hosts of geek nights the late-night podcast for geeks.

357
00:27:35,609 --> 00:27:39,287
Speaker 0: now This is a panel not about geek nights our podcast.

358
00:27:39,327 --> 00:27:41,256
Speaker 0: what about Podcasting in general?

359
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:49,209
Speaker 0: how to listen if anyone's interested how to make a podcast What this whole thing's about and then we'll probably just descend in general chaos as the panel goes on.

360
00:27:50,192 --> 00:27:51,436
Speaker 1: So thank you all for coming.

361
00:27:51,456 --> 00:27:53,843
Speaker 1: I know it's not easy to wake up.

362
00:27:53,943 --> 00:28:00,881
Speaker 1: It's Sunday at 10 in the morning after Yeah after a raucous Saturday night, so thank you.

363
00:28:00,901 --> 00:28:03,890
Speaker 0: All right, so how many of you listen to podcasts?

364
00:28:05,191 --> 00:28:07,602
Speaker 0: All right, how many of you have never heard of a podcast?

365
00:28:07,622 --> 00:28:11,455
Speaker 0: you just wandered into this room whoo All right.

366
00:28:11,697 --> 00:28:13,170
Speaker 0: Do any of you actually do a podcast?

367
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:14,471
Speaker 0: Really?

368
00:28:14,531 --> 00:28:19,548
Speaker 0: All right, we will do some shoutouts at the end to get you to pick your podcast since we got to represent here No to con.

369
00:28:20,571 --> 00:28:30,270
Speaker 0: But for all of you who have no idea about podcasting or how to listen We'd like to go through kind of what podcasting really is and the fact that you don't need an iPod to be a part of podcasting.

370
00:28:30,731 --> 00:28:37,510
Speaker 1: Well, technically a podcast is an RSS feed with enclosures pointing to multimedia coded files.

371
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,954
Speaker 1: But what that means?

372
00:28:38,994 --> 00:28:44,070
Speaker 0: that means in English if you have an mp3 player and any kind of pod catching software.

373
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:46,339
Speaker 0: There are millions of applications out there that all do it.

374
00:28:46,499 --> 00:28:47,463
Speaker 0: iTunes iTunes.

375
00:28:47,523 --> 00:28:49,110
Speaker 0: Pardon me is the one most people know.

376
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,119
Speaker 1: There's a juice receiver.

377
00:28:51,139 --> 00:28:57,290
Speaker 0: you subscribe to a radio show online So you go to their website and subscribe and then every time they make a new episode.

378
00:28:57,651 --> 00:29:01,181
Speaker 0: It's automatically downloaded the next time you plug in your mp3 player.

379
00:29:01,401 --> 00:29:04,510
Speaker 0: It's automatically put on the mp3 player and then you listen to it.

380
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:07,882
Speaker 0: It's like a radio show plus a TiVo on the internet.

381
00:29:08,505 --> 00:29:10,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you don't even need an mp3 player.

382
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:18,715
Speaker 1: I mean most people just listen on their computers with whatever Windows Media Player iTunes or whatever music player they have, you know And you don't even need.

383
00:29:18,815 --> 00:29:21,104
Speaker 1: all you need is a computer and an internet connection.

384
00:29:21,124 --> 00:29:23,816
Speaker 1: if you listen to us with dial-up I don't know what's up with that.

385
00:29:24,439 --> 00:29:26,390
Speaker 0: people listen to us with dial-up in foreign countries.

386
00:29:26,451 --> 00:29:27,528
Speaker 0: I don't know how they manage that.

387
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:32,163
Speaker 1: Yeah, and a podcast isn't necessarily just audio even though it's usually audio.

388
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:39,850
Speaker 1: There are plenty of video podcasts out there and Yeah, we don't make those because they're very difficult and time-consuming and bandwidth intensive.

389
00:29:40,432 --> 00:29:41,154
Speaker 0: Yeah, though one of them.

390
00:29:41,274 --> 00:29:44,202
Speaker 0: I mean ask a ninja is a very popular video podcasts.

391
00:29:45,065 --> 00:29:46,268
Speaker 0: one person recognized.

392
00:29:46,348 --> 00:29:49,098
Speaker 0: ask a ninja All right.

393
00:29:49,379 --> 00:29:50,223
Speaker 0: I know it's Sunday morning.

394
00:29:50,243 --> 00:29:50,604
Speaker 0: wake up.

395
00:29:51,448 --> 00:29:55,439
Speaker 3: Give me a Leroy Jenkins.

396
00:29:58,512 --> 00:29:58,814
Speaker 0: All right.

397
00:29:58,834 --> 00:29:59,698
Speaker 0: All right.

398
00:30:00,081 --> 00:30:02,954
Speaker 0: I've never had such a stellar crowd before Mm-hmm.

399
00:30:03,619 --> 00:30:09,246
Speaker 0: I will take some questions in a minute But is anyone everyone kind of clear on how to like what podcasts are how to listen to them?

400
00:30:09,286 --> 00:30:11,532
Speaker 0: It's just internet radio At all.

401
00:30:12,194 --> 00:30:13,858
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's exactly what it uses.

402
00:30:13,918 --> 00:30:26,900
Speaker 1: In fact, it's not a podcast if it doesn't use real simple syndication, you know I'll repeat because he wanted to know if the subscribing to podcast is using RSS real simple really simple syndication, which yes that's the only way.

403
00:30:26,921 --> 00:30:37,950
Speaker 1: and Basically someone makes you know an RSS feed and in each item in the feed They put what's called an enclosure which is just a URL to an mp3 or a video file.

404
00:30:38,512 --> 00:30:54,049
Speaker 1: and then if you use a piece of software like iTunes or juice receiver or iPod or or any of those things it recognizes the enclosure and When there's a new item in the feed and the enclosures there it automatically will get the episode for you And you can listen to it whenever you want.

405
00:30:54,532 --> 00:31:08,849
Speaker 0: And also what a lot of people do is if they don't want to install anything on their computer or they don't have an mp3 player you can go to like Odeo or Yahoo podcasts and they have players or things built into the web browser Or you just go to a website and you can just stream the audio directly from there.

406
00:31:09,291 --> 00:31:15,050
Speaker 1: I mean half our listeners don't even use the RSS feed or you know any of the podcasting features at all.

407
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:25,850
Speaker 1: They just visit our website four days a week Click on a link and download an mp3 and then play in their player without using anything fancy Though more than half of our listeners use Firefox.

408
00:31:29,071 --> 00:31:31,018
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you use Firefox, it's pretty easy.

409
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:33,687
Speaker 1: You can subscribe to podcasts with the live bookmarks.

410
00:31:33,707 --> 00:31:34,409
Speaker 1: It works pretty well.

411
00:31:35,388 --> 00:31:38,618
Speaker 0: now Podcasting really I mean webcomics.

412
00:31:38,678 --> 00:31:46,009
Speaker 0: now webcomics started out kind of this obscure thing and then they kind of ballooned and then one day they Exploded and suddenly mega Tokyo and penny arcade and all this is just huge.

413
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,489
Speaker 0: Podcasting hasn't quite reached that point yet.

414
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:51,200
Speaker 0: There are probably more people reading a popular webcomic.

415
00:31:51,521 --> 00:31:53,610
Speaker 0: then listen to all the podcasts combined.

416
00:31:54,952 --> 00:31:59,477
Speaker 1: There's some crazy popular podcasts, but they're usually Associated with big media.

417
00:31:59,577 --> 00:32:03,150
Speaker 1: I mean you don't see big media going into the web comics industry so much.

418
00:32:03,551 --> 00:32:09,810
Speaker 1: But there are podcasts of like major league baseball official podcasts ABC NBC CBS NPR.

419
00:32:10,091 --> 00:32:13,890
Speaker 1: All have official podcasts, you know, and those have a whole mess of listeners.

420
00:32:14,071 --> 00:32:18,204
Speaker 1: But those people, you know, they're only listening usually to that specific thing.

421
00:32:18,224 --> 00:32:20,170
Speaker 1: They're not into the podcasting scene.

422
00:32:21,252 --> 00:32:27,964
Speaker 0: But among the non huge podcast the best thing I mean you're all here at an anime concert Obviously some stretch of either nerd or geek, which is awesome.

423
00:32:28,004 --> 00:32:29,290
Speaker 0: Those are not bad words anymore.

424
00:32:29,913 --> 00:32:33,468
Speaker 0: There are more geekly podcast I think than there are anything else out there.

425
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,719
Speaker 0: I mean how many video game podcasts are there?

426
00:32:35,981 --> 00:32:37,348
Speaker 1: too many and none of them are good.

427
00:32:40,632 --> 00:32:47,510
Speaker 1: Yet generally what happened is because early in the podcasting days The only people who knew how to use RSS and all this stuff were geeks.

428
00:32:47,831 --> 00:33:02,483
Speaker 1: So the podcast that became the most popular and got the most attention early on were the podcast targeted towards the geek demographic podcasts like twit, I got it, you know, like a hajillion listeners and You know all the podcasts that are sort of there.

429
00:33:02,603 --> 00:33:04,270
Speaker 1: I mean there are crazy podcasts out there.

430
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:07,744
Speaker 1: There's one that's like about Australian real estate market and stuff.

431
00:33:08,106 --> 00:33:09,029
Speaker 1: It gets kind of crazy.

432
00:33:09,733 --> 00:33:11,443
Speaker 0: But you think you just made up that weird example.

433
00:33:11,483 --> 00:33:12,650
Speaker 0: That's a big podcast.

434
00:33:13,272 --> 00:33:14,676
Speaker 1: It is a pretty happening.

435
00:33:14,696 --> 00:33:19,430
Speaker 1: this is a podcast about like financial aid for colleges, that's all they talk about like every week.

436
00:33:20,372 --> 00:33:20,895
Speaker 1: It's crazy.

437
00:33:21,116 --> 00:33:24,816
Speaker 0: And of course, I know the question burning on everyone's mind Are there anime podcasts?

438
00:33:25,298 --> 00:33:27,125
Speaker 0: and the answer is there's an infinite number of them.

439
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:31,570
Speaker 0: I Actually, they're here and they're supposed to be at this panel with us.

440
00:33:31,911 --> 00:33:34,378
Speaker 0: We don't know where they went but anime world order.

441
00:33:34,418 --> 00:33:35,922
Speaker 0: You might have seen their flyers.

442
00:33:36,263 --> 00:33:36,824
Speaker 0: They're here.

443
00:33:37,346 --> 00:33:37,807
Speaker 0: Are they here?

444
00:33:37,827 --> 00:33:39,317
Speaker 0: I Didn't see them.

445
00:33:39,541 --> 00:33:40,070
Speaker 0: I still don't see.

446
00:33:40,382 --> 00:33:43,054
Speaker 0: Okay There's some work on.

447
00:33:43,094 --> 00:33:46,346
Speaker 0: they were in our room last night and despite their assassination attempt.

448
00:33:46,387 --> 00:33:47,210
Speaker 0: We were still here today.

449
00:33:47,632 --> 00:33:49,319
Speaker 1: That's right a clown.

450
00:33:49,339 --> 00:33:50,887
Speaker 1: We are immune to clown pistol.

451
00:33:50,907 --> 00:33:56,586
Speaker 0: Yeah I was shot in the face with a clown pistol after Daryl Surratt screamed six-center tyrannous last night.

452
00:33:56,646 --> 00:33:59,288
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Got a little bruise still.

453
00:34:00,432 --> 00:34:03,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, the anime podcast pretty much fall into two categories.

454
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:06,390
Speaker 1: There's the ones that's one fanboy going.

455
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:12,565
Speaker 1: Yeah, my favorite anime is this and it was so great and you don't listen to those worst anime ever.

456
00:34:13,348 --> 00:34:18,505
Speaker 1: and then there's like The three or four ones that are actually intelligent like ours.

457
00:34:21,132 --> 00:34:23,170
Speaker 0: Ours really goes beyond an anime podcast.

458
00:34:23,291 --> 00:34:25,159
Speaker 0: We're kind of well, we'll get it up.

459
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:27,469
Speaker 0: you guys actually are you interested in how to like how we do this?

460
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,429
Speaker 0: How people make podcast how this all works?

461
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,983
Speaker 0: All right, I don't know if they picked it up but everyone yelled.

462
00:34:33,003 --> 00:34:34,089
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we'll get right into that.

463
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:37,085
Speaker 0: We do a show called geek nights.

464
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:44,190
Speaker 0: now We do it four nights a week for about an hour every night, which is crazy by most people's standards.

465
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:45,949
Speaker 1: I mean, they're like, how do you do it?

466
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:48,569
Speaker 1: And we're like we sit down and talk for an hour every night.

467
00:34:49,132 --> 00:34:52,130
Speaker 0: See the thing is I mean, we're really not trying to diss anyone or anything.

468
00:34:52,150 --> 00:35:02,629
Speaker 0: But in terms of podcasting it seems like a lot of the podcast has started early on Or I'm people who really knew a lot about what they wanted to talk about Not so much about the audio or the tech or all that stuff.

469
00:35:03,051 --> 00:35:11,622
Speaker 0: so a lot of podcasts have a lot of good content, but they're hard to listen to either because of audio problems or Their website is difficult to use if the RSS feeds are broken.

470
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:18,010
Speaker 0: a lot of good podcasts don't show up in iTunes Just because people don't know how to do all the stuff to make it show up in iTunes.

471
00:35:18,471 --> 00:35:23,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's some podcasts that I honestly want to listen to but they don't even have it a feed with enclosures.

472
00:35:23,771 --> 00:35:24,073
Speaker 1: It's just.

473
00:35:24,153 --> 00:35:38,990
Speaker 1: I would have to go to their website every once in a while to Maybe find a new episode if I'm lucky and it's just not worth the effort no matter how good their show is The effort of constantly checking a website all the time for a new episode.

474
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:42,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean some people listen to one or two podcasts.

475
00:35:42,371 --> 00:35:49,296
Speaker 0: Yeah, they'll just go to the website every day and download the episode But if the episode gets uploaded an hour later Then they'll miss it till the next day.

476
00:35:49,316 --> 00:35:54,510
Speaker 0: or if you listen to 20 podcasts and they update every day Why not just have it all automatic?

477
00:35:55,350 --> 00:36:04,450
Speaker 0: So if one podcast isn't automatic they really lose out on listenership just because a lot of like most people who listen to the podcasts They don't even know that you can listen to them outside of iTunes.

478
00:36:05,192 --> 00:36:07,164
Speaker 0: So it doesn't show up in iTunes as far as they're concerned.

479
00:36:07,184 --> 00:36:07,989
Speaker 0: It doesn't even exist.

480
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:11,199
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty sad that you know it.

481
00:36:11,821 --> 00:36:14,575
Speaker 1: It was a big mistake when they came up with the word podcast It's like.

482
00:36:14,636 --> 00:36:22,417
Speaker 1: at first they thought all right That's the perfect word, and then they're like oh wait now We have to tell everyone a thousand times that you don't need an iPod You don't need iTunes.

483
00:36:22,497 --> 00:36:25,210
Speaker 0: and yeah, how many times when we tell someone one of our old friends?

484
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,121
Speaker 0: Hey, we do a radio show now a podcast.

485
00:36:27,584 --> 00:36:30,536
Speaker 0: Oh, I don't have an iPod You don't need one.

486
00:36:30,717 --> 00:36:35,030
Speaker 1: if you can play an mp3 and download an mp3 you can listen to podcasts.

487
00:36:36,032 --> 00:36:36,374
Speaker 1: That's it.

488
00:36:36,979 --> 00:36:43,943
Speaker 0: Yep now in terms of actually Recording or doing this it seems There's a lot of bad information out there on the internet.

489
00:36:44,004 --> 00:37:04,044
Speaker 0: if you just think like oh I'm gonna do a podcast and Google around or look at what other people have said they've done I hate to say it But most of the guides out there Really give terrible advice as to how to make your audio sound good or how to use the applications properly or actually This is kind of an aside, but the worst thing is that Apple seems to really push a lot of their solutions like buy a Mac.

490
00:37:04,084 --> 00:37:11,887
Speaker 0: It's really easy to podcast and We found by doing it four nights a week that Macs are really not a good solution for podcasting at all.

491
00:37:11,987 --> 00:37:15,437
Speaker 0: and GarageBand Which is really promoted as this podcasting tool.

492
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:22,160
Speaker 0: if you go beyond the most amateur level in the world like if you try to go Anywhere beyond that it's pretty much unusable.

493
00:37:22,984 --> 00:37:32,150
Speaker 0: It just it doesn't have the functionality It doesn't have the features it has arbitrary limits in it Like you can't even record an episode as long as you want because it'll arbitrarily say oh that was too long.

494
00:37:32,212 --> 00:37:32,787
Speaker 0: I'm stopping you.

495
00:37:33,452 --> 00:37:48,432
Speaker 1: The worst thing about if you use GarageBand to make a podcast and you don't know what you're doing if you just follow the instructions That Apple gives you you will accidentally make a podcast that really does need an iPod or iTunes to listen to and that's really Really bad.

496
00:37:48,472 --> 00:37:54,854
Speaker 1: you're basically saying oh those millions of people with windows and whatever they can't listen to my show Screw them.

497
00:37:55,055 --> 00:37:58,490
Speaker 1: only Apple people can listen to my show which is not very good.

498
00:37:58,872 --> 00:38:00,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, one of our listeners wants asked us.

499
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,110
Speaker 0: Why don't you do the Apple enhanced podcast?

500
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,428
Speaker 0: I think it would be really cool.

501
00:38:03,831 --> 00:38:09,548
Speaker 0: We had to explain to him that that would alienate at least half of our listeners who don't have Apple don't have iPods And they still want to listen.

502
00:38:10,232 --> 00:38:11,274
Speaker 1: Yeah, also the.

503
00:38:11,475 --> 00:38:21,570
Speaker 1: if you could we could do some people put an enhanced podcast and a normal mp3 podcast up together But that doubles the amount of bandwidth and storage we need and it really really sucks.

504
00:38:22,452 --> 00:38:24,241
Speaker 0: Now what we use to actually record the show.

505
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:25,810
Speaker 0: we'll take a whole bunch of questions in a little bit.

506
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,850
Speaker 0: We've got a lovely assistant here Nury.

507
00:38:28,191 --> 00:38:36,624
Speaker 0: We'll be going around with a microphone at some point because we are recording this and it's all going to go up on our show After we get back from the Jersey Shore at some point.

508
00:38:38,891 --> 00:38:46,389
Speaker 0: But we've got a Linux box actually running Gentoo and on that we run a program called resound Which is if anyone has ever heard of it?

509
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:58,610
Speaker 1: It's like an old program called cool edit Pro or cool edit 2000 Which yeah, if you can get cool edit Pro or cool edit 2000 Those are the ultimate wave editing programs ever created and you can make awesome podcasts with that.

510
00:38:58,691 --> 00:39:00,490
Speaker 1: But it's they don't make it anymore.

511
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:08,359
Speaker 1: What happened was Adobe bought it and then they removed a bunch of good stuff from it and added a bunch of other Crap that you don't care about to it.

512
00:39:08,419 --> 00:39:10,370
Speaker 1: and they called it audition and they doubled the price.

513
00:39:11,071 --> 00:39:16,450
Speaker 0: So I mean cool edit really was the industry standard for a lot of radio stations like professional ones for the longest time.

514
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:21,830
Speaker 0: But resound is an open source program that it mimics almost all the functionality of cool edit.

515
00:39:22,513 --> 00:39:27,071
Speaker 0: And it's actually got to the point now where there are many cases where it goes beyond what cool edit can even do in the first Place.

516
00:39:27,693 --> 00:39:30,141
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if you're loaded you can buy audition.

517
00:39:30,381 --> 00:39:33,110
Speaker 1: if you're poor you can install Linux and get resound for free.

518
00:39:33,672 --> 00:39:38,970
Speaker 0: Now what most people use who do podcasts actually is a program called audacity, which is also open source.

519
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,978
Speaker 0: But you can run it on Windows Linux.

520
00:39:40,998 --> 00:39:44,230
Speaker 0: you can even run it on Macs if you want and it's really easy to use.

521
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:44,631
Speaker 0: It's got.

522
00:39:45,093 --> 00:39:49,990
Speaker 0: basic functionality is there to where you could put a pretty good podcast with it even not knowing a lot about audio.

523
00:39:50,751 --> 00:40:00,827
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if you get really if you get more advanced audacity will eventually not have the features you're looking for and you know Some of the filters in it, you might want to do something different and it just doesn't have.

524
00:40:00,847 --> 00:40:07,310
Speaker 1: you know The controls that you want and you know, so if you keep it simple and audacity is probably all you're ever gonna need.

525
00:40:07,451 --> 00:40:10,570
Speaker 1: But if you want to do fancy stuff, you're gonna need something else like resound.

526
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:16,789
Speaker 0: I mean really in terms of what you use to do a podcast you have to decide Are you doing this just for fun?

527
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:19,790
Speaker 0: Do you really want to learn about how to do this the professional way?

528
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:21,736
Speaker 0: How deeply do you want to get into this?

529
00:40:22,037 --> 00:40:24,769
Speaker 0: because the scale of money you can spend is from five bucks to?

530
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:28,664
Speaker 0: Tens of thousands of dollars on fancy equipment like a certain podcast.

531
00:40:28,684 --> 00:40:30,170
Speaker 0: We know that still doesn't sound so good.

532
00:40:30,411 --> 00:40:33,345
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean look at all this equipment those guys have over there.

533
00:40:33,406 --> 00:40:36,349
Speaker 1: if we had that stuff We could make some crazy freaking podcast.

534
00:40:36,711 --> 00:40:40,550
Speaker 0: The AV guy who sets up this room was actually laughing at our tiny little mixer we have here?

535
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:46,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, instead we have like a hundred dollars worth of junk on the floor, which is more than most people have.

536
00:40:47,051 --> 00:40:53,889
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, we'll go through all the hardware in a minute and we try to show it to you But it's all plugged in but after the panel we can totally just show you like everything we've got.

537
00:40:53,929 --> 00:41:00,271
Speaker 0: now It's plugged in but in terms of actually doing the podcast and you know how deeply you want to get into it There's.

538
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:17,136
Speaker 0: you have to learn a lot about audio and if you use like resound or audacity and you get Audio textbooks and you actually try to learn how to do it better as opposed to using an apple Which will make it sound pretty good to start, but you really can't go anywhere from there You'll learn a lot about audio.

539
00:41:17,157 --> 00:41:20,410
Speaker 0: You'll learn a lot of valuable skills that maybe you could use in a job someday.

540
00:41:20,491 --> 00:41:23,550
Speaker 0: I mean you can put audio engineer on your resume there.

541
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:27,849
Speaker 0: You've already gained something from podcasting even if your podcast pod fades as they like to call it.

542
00:41:28,372 --> 00:41:30,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I mean even if you.

543
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,470
Speaker 1: there's also this web hosting side of it.

544
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:33,514
Speaker 1: You know, there's a lot of.

545
00:41:33,916 --> 00:41:35,443
Speaker 1: you need to manage blog software.

546
00:41:35,463 --> 00:41:39,790
Speaker 1: you need to manage the RSS feed You need to manage all those podcast directories.

547
00:41:40,132 --> 00:41:43,790
Speaker 1: So in addition to getting audio engineering skills, you're getting a lot of webmastering skills.

548
00:41:44,432 --> 00:41:47,423
Speaker 1: If you don't have the webmastering skills, your podcast isn't going to work.

549
00:41:47,986 --> 00:41:57,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, like most podcasters they either use something like libsyn which has a good service for doing podcasts or They'll use wordpress.com and then feed burner to run the feed.

550
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:03,230
Speaker 0: We'll talk about all that stuff in detail, but we actually because we're technologists I mean, we're both computer professionals.

551
00:42:03,853 --> 00:42:11,570
Speaker 0: We have our own hosting as in we have our own Linux box in the sky that we run our own Everything on our own web server our own forums our own jabber server.

552
00:42:12,272 --> 00:42:16,527
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a lot of fun to actually manage everything on the low level that way.

553
00:42:16,647 --> 00:42:26,570
Speaker 1: if something goes wrong I know it's my fault and I know I can fix it instead of having to wait for some guy Who might be on vacation to come and do something to some computer somewhere?

554
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:28,969
Speaker 0: But at the same time it takes a lot more work.

555
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:37,997
Speaker 0: I mean if you're just using like libsyn and libsyn goes down all you do is email libsyn and say hey my podcast disappeared WTF and maybe it'll come back up at some point.

556
00:42:38,499 --> 00:42:40,044
Speaker 0: we if it goes down.

557
00:42:40,265 --> 00:42:41,629
Speaker 0: we have to sit there and try to fix it.

558
00:42:42,571 --> 00:42:47,310
Speaker 0: But at the same time by dealing with all that you'll learn a lot and your podcast will get better and better and better.

559
00:42:47,411 --> 00:42:51,721
Speaker 0: it'll sound better it'll look more professional and You'll learn a lot.

560
00:42:51,741 --> 00:42:52,167
Speaker 0: What can I say?

561
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:58,329
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if you actually want to make a podcast, you know, you get the software we just described to you.

562
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:02,224
Speaker 1: You plug a microphone into the computer and you push record.

563
00:43:02,244 --> 00:43:03,830
Speaker 1: It's really that easy.

564
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:09,350
Speaker 0: Microphones are a big source of confusion for a lot of people because most people you buy a computer.

565
00:43:09,852 --> 00:43:15,630
Speaker 0: It either has a microphone built into it or it comes with like that tiny little white stick microphone that comes with most sound cards.

566
00:43:16,394 --> 00:43:19,349
Speaker 0: You really me you really can't use that.

567
00:43:19,851 --> 00:43:25,390
Speaker 0: I mean it's cheap, but your podcast will sound terrible like if anyone listened to the first penny arcade podcast.

568
00:43:26,111 --> 00:43:29,810
Speaker 0: They basically use something like that sitting on one side of the room and it just it was almost unlistenable.

569
00:43:30,711 --> 00:43:32,276
Speaker 0: But that doesn't mean you have to spend a lot of money.

570
00:43:32,617 --> 00:43:36,250
Speaker 0: We have $20 RadioShack microphones and our broadcast sounds pretty good.

571
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:41,616
Speaker 0: I think I could say yeah, I think we need to buy some of these things though We got to upgrade at this point.

572
00:43:41,817 --> 00:43:51,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, since we have this giant crowd here, obviously Please don't spend more money than your skill allows.

573
00:43:51,471 --> 00:44:00,557
Speaker 1: I mean a lot of people will you know, they get in, you know They get into something and then they buy fancy equipment like guys will get into golf and then they'll buy a fancy set of golf Clubs thinking it'll make them better at golf.

574
00:44:01,018 --> 00:44:02,564
Speaker 1: The same thing is true with podcasting.

575
00:44:02,584 --> 00:44:04,110
Speaker 1: a lot of people get into podcasting.

576
00:44:04,373 --> 00:44:09,667
Speaker 1: They spend thousands of dollars Like I get a fancy microphone at a big mixer and they don't know really how to use it.

577
00:44:09,727 --> 00:44:13,410
Speaker 1: that well So it doesn't help their audio quality that much.

578
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:21,569
Speaker 1: We've done the opposite where we spend the minimum Possible and we use our knowledge to bring the quality up above a lot of the people who spend more money than we do.

579
00:44:22,353 --> 00:44:26,070
Speaker 0: Because really I mean podcasting is fun and great and you can just do it in your spare time.

580
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:33,268
Speaker 0: But it will take a lot of time and a lot of effort at least initially as you Learn how to edit audio and you learn what sounds good and what doesn't.

581
00:44:33,328 --> 00:44:46,083
Speaker 0: I mean When we started doing the show it would take me about three hours after every episode to Do all the stuff to it to make it sound good to you guys, you know post-production editing out, you know Scott coughing or Scott burping or Scott dropping the microphone

582
00:44:46,303 --> 00:44:47,588
Speaker 1: rim hacking up a loogie.

583
00:44:47,829 --> 00:44:57,679
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, or when we forget something or you forget what we're talking about or we forget the mics aren't actually on and we talk for An hour or you accidentally delete the whole episode.

584
00:44:57,699 --> 00:44:59,987
Speaker 0: that only happened two or three times.

585
00:45:00,228 --> 00:45:10,778
Speaker 0: Yeah okay, and As it goes on it's gotten to the point now where it takes us literally maybe two minutes worth of Editing to make the show ready to go yet.

586
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:14,410
Speaker 1: What really takes the longest now is the actual computer processing.

587
00:45:14,491 --> 00:45:15,054
Speaker 1: I mean rims.

588
00:45:15,095 --> 00:45:17,370
Speaker 1: computer is a half on one gigahertz.

589
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:20,604
Speaker 1: It takes you know, he clicks make mp3 and we wait ten minutes.

590
00:45:20,805 --> 00:45:22,050
Speaker 1: It's it's really kind of painful.

591
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:23,796
Speaker 0: Hey, I built that computer for $4,000 in like 1999.

592
00:45:23,796 --> 00:45:29,492
Speaker 0: It's time to buy a new box Now.

593
00:45:29,512 --> 00:45:37,870
Speaker 0: I suppose I mean we could ramble on a lot about all the specific details of what we use for hosting what we use Equipment wise but I guess at this point we could send our lovely assistant.

594
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:43,925
Speaker 0: And if you guys have specific questions since it's kind of a small crowd I guess we can really address all of you almost individual.

595
00:45:43,966 --> 00:45:44,550
Speaker 0: if you really want.

596
00:45:44,731 --> 00:45:45,455
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll get all nice.

597
00:45:45,495 --> 00:45:47,024
Speaker 0: and yes, that was indeed your cue.

598
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:49,156
Speaker 0: Oh lovely assistant This is Mary.

599
00:45:49,176 --> 00:45:51,530
Speaker 0: by the way, who does a podcast called artists alley?

600
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,994
Speaker 1: Don't turn it on in front of the speakers or we'll all die.

601
00:45:57,175 --> 00:45:59,995
Speaker 0: Yes walk it Walk across then turn it on.

602
00:46:01,702 --> 00:46:02,327
Speaker 0: See it's amazing.

603
00:46:02,367 --> 00:46:03,980
Speaker 0: I do just doing this for so long.

604
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,280
Speaker 0: You'll learn so much about how to deal with all this audio stuff or like how to hold a microphone properly.

605
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,814
Speaker 0: We've Scott still kind of struggling with from time to time.

606
00:46:12,156 --> 00:46:12,679
Speaker 1: What can I say?

607
00:46:15,094 --> 00:46:17,309
Speaker 1: Hello You were mentioned.

608
00:46:17,369 --> 00:46:21,291
Speaker 1: you were talking earlier about Enhanced podcast Apple enhanced podcast.

609
00:46:21,331 --> 00:46:23,420
Speaker 1: What's the difference between an enhanced podcast?

610
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:27,278
Speaker 1: I think okay our podcast is an mp3 file.

611
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:30,809
Speaker 1: You can play it on anything that plays an mp3.

612
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:33,697
Speaker 1: an enhanced podcast is an Apple.

613
00:46:33,777 --> 00:46:34,900
Speaker 1: It's a special Apple thing.

614
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:35,804
Speaker 1: That's Apple only.

615
00:46:35,844 --> 00:46:41,097
Speaker 1: so you need iTunes or an iPod and what they do is first It's an AAC file and not an mp3.

616
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:45,593
Speaker 1: So you need some software that can play an AAC in order to hear the audio.

617
00:46:45,934 --> 00:46:52,791
Speaker 0: now a lot of modern even not iPods But mp3 players will play AAC But not everything and there are people who actually couldn't listen to now.

618
00:46:52,831 --> 00:46:58,940
Speaker 1: in addition what it does for you is if you have this Normal AAC is which are just audio and that's not a big deal.

619
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:01,250
Speaker 1: But an enhanced AAC does.

620
00:47:01,793 --> 00:47:02,817
Speaker 1: it does three things for you.

621
00:47:02,877 --> 00:47:03,359
Speaker 1: number one?

622
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:06,760
Speaker 1: You can put like these markers within your podcast.

623
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:11,780
Speaker 1: So for example our podcast starts out with the news and the thing of the day than the main bit.

624
00:47:12,222 --> 00:47:22,258
Speaker 1: We can put little markers at the beginning of each segment that allow people using the enhanced Podcast to skip around to different segments, so it's like chapter markers on exactly.

625
00:47:22,278 --> 00:47:28,300
Speaker 1: it Also allows you to put different images album covers for different parts of the podcast.

626
00:47:28,461 --> 00:47:34,602
Speaker 1: so if you're talking about a race car in the first part of the episode you can have a picture of a race car as The album art.

627
00:47:34,683 --> 00:47:39,602
Speaker 1: and then later on you're talking about the or really owl and you have a picture of an owl is the album Art.

628
00:47:40,205 --> 00:47:42,479
Speaker 1: and the third thing it does is it allows you.

629
00:47:43,362 --> 00:47:46,791
Speaker 1: It allows you to put a link to a website in the album art.

630
00:47:46,832 --> 00:47:57,220
Speaker 1: so if someone's listening with iTunes, and you start talking about Otakon then there'll be a picture of the Otakon logo down there with a link to Otakon.com right there.

631
00:47:57,441 --> 00:48:01,966
Speaker 1: So if someone's listening and they go oh, that's pretty interesting they look over in the corner They see a link.

632
00:48:02,006 --> 00:48:02,651
Speaker 1: they click on it.

633
00:48:02,692 --> 00:48:03,700
Speaker 1: it opens up in their browser.

634
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:11,020
Speaker 1: It's actually pretty cool, but you're alienating so many listeners by doing it that it's kind of not worth it.

635
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:12,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean we're not saying don't do it at all.

636
00:48:12,741 --> 00:48:14,210
Speaker 0: We're just saying we don't do it because of our.

637
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:15,820
Speaker 0: we really kind of have a broad appeal.

638
00:48:15,981 --> 00:48:22,306
Speaker 0: But in terms of there are a lot of podcasts that make very good use of that like podcasts that tried to teach you Japanese which there are a lot of.

639
00:48:22,828 --> 00:48:27,820
Speaker 0: they'll show the Kana or they'll show kanji while they talk about him And it's a great method of learning all the kanji.

640
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:38,741
Speaker 0: you know if you see the kanji there in your iPod and it's telling you about the kanji and then the next one back and forth or Technology podcast they'll show the schematic diagram of whatever thing they're talking about while they're talking about it Which

641
00:48:38,901 --> 00:48:50,099
Speaker 1: yeah, I find it's really good for music podcast because you you know as you listen to different songs throughout the podcast You'll see the cover of the album that they're playing and you'll have a link to the band's website And all that kind of cool stuff.

642
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:53,948
Speaker 1: But yeah If you have a lot of money and a lot of bandwidth.

643
00:48:54,068 --> 00:49:02,620
Speaker 1: you can do a normal mp3 and an enhanced podcast for the people Who want the enhanced podcast, but if you can't afford you know double?

644
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:07,899
Speaker 1: Bandwidth and double the storage for all your podcasting needs, then you probably should just make an mp3.

645
00:49:08,682 --> 00:49:13,099
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean we already spend over a thousand dollars a year just on bandwidth and hosting at this point.

646
00:49:13,601 --> 00:49:15,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'd add in two feeds.

647
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:15,975
Speaker 0: We'd have double that.

648
00:49:16,257 --> 00:49:22,470
Speaker 1: yeah All right question Dylan time.

649
00:49:23,981 --> 00:49:25,679
Speaker 1: Actually sort of a direct question.

650
00:49:26,601 --> 00:49:29,358
Speaker 1: I've just started listening to your podcast, so I haven't caught up yet.

651
00:49:30,203 --> 00:49:37,286
Speaker 1: By now has somebody told you what the duty of grand Fenwick is The touchy of grand Fenwick.

652
00:49:37,828 --> 00:49:40,498
Speaker 0: we had a couple people answer the question which made me very happy.

653
00:49:40,538 --> 00:49:52,079
Speaker 0: good Yeah, our podcast has actually gotten a somewhat interesting community around it to the point that our forums are basically a whole Text-based show I mean unto themselves.

654
00:49:54,230 --> 00:50:15,677
Speaker 1: Yeah All right, I have a Convention well a meeting and we want to podcast those two people who were not able to attend that and we have Some background hiss from our audio equipment Because again we couldn't afford to bring big stuff.

655
00:50:17,301 --> 00:50:19,263
Speaker 1: Is there software to take out that?

656
00:50:19,283 --> 00:50:23,088
Speaker 1: yes before we actually broadcast it and what?

657
00:50:23,108 --> 00:50:24,270
Speaker 1: how difficult is that to do?

658
00:50:25,334 --> 00:50:35,441
Speaker 0: There I could go into excruciating detail into how to Like how to take the hiss out how to get rid of noise all that stuff And I'll try to keep it as informative and yet light as I can.

659
00:50:35,541 --> 00:50:41,150
Speaker 0: but basically there are a couple of ways to deal with Noise, I mean you know most of you've ever tried to record something on your computer.

660
00:50:41,511 --> 00:50:49,108
Speaker 0: There's that hissing noise in the background or a low hum sometimes or your voice is just really scratchy I hope sounds like those.

661
00:50:50,132 --> 00:50:54,847
Speaker 1: Or you breathe into the microphone you know because you hold it next to your face all the time like that.

662
00:50:57,210 --> 00:50:59,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, or the speaker.

663
00:50:59,944 --> 00:51:05,552
Speaker 1: some of them are nailing the mic Microphone.

664
00:51:05,612 --> 00:51:07,903
Speaker 0: discipline is a very important part of podcasting.

665
00:51:07,943 --> 00:51:09,189
Speaker 0: How annoying is this right now?

666
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:11,587
Speaker 0: Would you listen to a podcast that did this for an hour?

667
00:51:13,391 --> 00:51:19,081
Speaker 0: There are so many to do and I hate it because I like the podcast But I just can't listen to him because they keep going like this.

668
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,790
Speaker 0: I have no idea what they're actually talking about.

669
00:51:21,673 --> 00:51:35,689
Speaker 0: But in terms of like hisses and noise If you the hardware solution is something called a noise gate which in its simplest form is a tiny little thing that says whenever the Audio level is below a certain threshold it gets rid of all the audio there at all.

670
00:51:36,131 --> 00:51:40,070
Speaker 0: So if there's a low hiss whenever you're not talking that low hiss disappears.

671
00:51:40,291 --> 00:51:44,047
Speaker 0: And then when you amplify the whole podcast it doesn't amplify that hissing.

672
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:44,770
Speaker 0: you make it a louder hiss.

673
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:47,323
Speaker 0: More advanced ways to get rid of noise.

674
00:51:47,383 --> 00:51:54,670
Speaker 0: if you use audacity It has a nice function where you highlight an empty part of your podcast like while you're recording you record 10 seconds of silence.

675
00:51:55,137 --> 00:52:02,221
Speaker 0: You highlight it And then you kick a. they call it a noise signature And it'll try to figure out what frequencies all the noise are in.

676
00:52:02,622 --> 00:52:07,782
Speaker 0: and then you can remove that from the rest of the show Which works with varying degrees of success.

677
00:52:07,963 --> 00:52:09,208
Speaker 0: you really have to experiment with it.

678
00:52:09,731 --> 00:52:13,222
Speaker 0: Generally the more noise you remove the more you sound like a robot on the show.

679
00:52:14,125 --> 00:52:16,666
Speaker 1: I can't tell you how many robot podcasts I've listened to it.

680
00:52:19,031 --> 00:52:20,114
Speaker 0: The hardware in general.

681
00:52:20,154 --> 00:52:26,034
Speaker 0: in terms of this sort of thing a hardware solution is always better than a software solution in terms of quality And ease of use.

682
00:52:26,457 --> 00:52:28,990
Speaker 0: but a software solution is usually free.

683
00:52:30,393 --> 00:52:30,900
Speaker 0: That is key.

684
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:31,690
Speaker 0: I mean a noise gate.

685
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:39,809
Speaker 0: You know twenty thirty dollars But it all adds up as you buy noise gates compressors for every audio problem you have there's a piece of hardware That'll make it go away.

686
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:48,350
Speaker 1: But that's one more chunk of money you have to spend and even when there is a piece of hardware that can make your problem You're gonna have to spend some time learning to use that piece of hardware.

687
00:52:48,531 --> 00:52:49,859
Speaker 1: I mean a noise gates.

688
00:52:49,879 --> 00:52:54,059
Speaker 1: pretty simple I could set one of those up But a compressor is a lot more difficult.

689
00:52:54,179 --> 00:52:56,969
Speaker 1: if you don't know about audio engineering you're gonna have to read some books.

690
00:52:57,857 --> 00:53:07,915
Speaker 1: Yeah Actually when we did record this we had it compressed and that was part of the problem because it was a little bit of a noisy Mixer.

691
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:10,328
Speaker 1: so it did bring the floor up and that brought the noise up.

692
00:53:11,075 --> 00:53:19,279
Speaker 0: Actually if you have a big problem with noise There's a hardware thing or actually you can do this in software in a lot of programs called an expander Which obviously opposite of a compressor.

693
00:53:19,842 --> 00:53:21,770
Speaker 0: now actually I'll talk about this now.

694
00:53:21,971 --> 00:53:26,886
Speaker 0: It's a nice segue because this is really an important part of podcasting that very few podcasts.

695
00:53:26,906 --> 00:53:27,950
Speaker 0: You know how to do properly.

696
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:37,510
Speaker 0: There there are two ways to deal with noise and two ways to deal with audio levels But generally you want everything in a podcast to be about the same volume.

697
00:53:37,651 --> 00:53:39,629
Speaker 0: It's not music or there's a quiet part in a loud part.

698
00:53:40,011 --> 00:53:44,589
Speaker 0: You don't want one guy in a podcast to be really loud and one guy to be really quiet because that's annoying.

699
00:53:44,609 --> 00:53:51,524
Speaker 0: and a compressor what it does is It'll once the audio gets above a certain loudness.

700
00:53:51,946 --> 00:53:57,070
Speaker 0: It'll start Decreasing the amplitude or reducing the gain on that audio further.

701
00:53:57,151 --> 00:54:00,109
Speaker 0: So the louder I talk the more it turns the volume down on me.

702
00:54:00,511 --> 00:54:04,450
Speaker 0: So in the end no matter how much I yell the podcast it still sounds pretty much the same.

703
00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:05,965
Speaker 0: it doesn't get that much louder.

704
00:54:05,986 --> 00:54:13,030
Speaker 0: and The problem with this is that you're making the whole thing quieter as a result because all they can do is take away audio.

705
00:54:13,813 --> 00:54:17,590
Speaker 0: Now you have noise like the hissing the hum and all that and that's really low.

706
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:21,465
Speaker 0: That's like this low level like you look at a picture of a wave, you know, the actual audio.

707
00:54:21,826 --> 00:54:35,530
Speaker 0: There's this low-level warbling going on when no one's talking and If you compress the highest vocal points the highest Amplitude of the wave the points where you're talking the loudest are far away from that noise.

708
00:54:36,052 --> 00:54:38,180
Speaker 0: That way the noise is overpowered by your voice.

709
00:54:38,622 --> 00:54:43,349
Speaker 0: when you compress you make that How I'm trying to do this in such non-technical terms.

710
00:54:44,313 --> 00:54:46,964
Speaker 1: If you fail miserably, you're bringing those peaks down.

711
00:54:47,024 --> 00:54:51,181
Speaker 0: you're bringing your audio level down Which means my voice is now closer to that noise.

712
00:54:51,683 --> 00:54:53,250
Speaker 0: So you've brought the noise floor up.

713
00:54:53,912 --> 00:54:58,250
Speaker 0: The floor below which the noise is is higher and as a result, there's more noise in your podcast.

714
00:54:58,571 --> 00:55:04,695
Speaker 1: it makes a lot more sense when you look at some of the waves from when you talk and then you can see ah Someone shows you a picture of.

715
00:55:04,735 --> 00:55:08,930
Speaker 1: this is what a good wave should look like and this is what you have recorded.

716
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:10,239
Speaker 1: You're like, oh my god.

717
00:55:10,299 --> 00:55:11,085
Speaker 1: It's so bad.

718
00:55:11,105 --> 00:55:15,830
Speaker 0: Oh Just basically it if Scott yells it turns the volume down on him automatically.

719
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:17,770
Speaker 0: Now an expander is what you need.

720
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:19,517
Speaker 0: It does the exact opposite it.

721
00:55:19,778 --> 00:55:22,168
Speaker 0: the louder something is the louder it makes it.

722
00:55:22,429 --> 00:55:26,321
Speaker 0: so it Expands the audio and it amplifies everything except the noise.

723
00:55:26,662 --> 00:55:29,170
Speaker 0: it amplifies everything that's above a certain threshold.

724
00:55:29,612 --> 00:55:35,240
Speaker 0: so the noise or the hiss which is below that won't get picked up and That would probably deal with the problem.

725
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:39,791
Speaker 0: you have at least to some degree All right more questions.

726
00:55:44,917 --> 00:55:47,320
Speaker 0: I swear to God if we get feedback in this room, I'll scream.

727
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:56,515
Speaker 1: hi Um, yeah, my question is that say like that a couple of my friends of mine want to do a pocket but we want for example interview somebody but they're not in the same room.

728
00:55:56,555 --> 00:55:57,098
Speaker 1: as I say like.

729
00:55:57,118 --> 00:56:00,877
Speaker 1: they're like Oh Just like in another state or something.

730
00:56:02,246 --> 00:56:03,320
Speaker 1: What's for PC users?

731
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:06,008
Speaker 1: What's the best software you recommend for that?

732
00:56:06,309 --> 00:56:09,740
Speaker 1: to do a conference and report a podcast before you're interviewing someone?

733
00:56:10,482 --> 00:56:11,674
Speaker 0: Well, there's a story here.

734
00:56:12,037 --> 00:56:12,299
Speaker 1: Okay?

735
00:56:13,982 --> 00:56:18,559
Speaker 1: There are many many ways and as always a lot of money will make it really easy.

736
00:56:19,082 --> 00:56:21,914
Speaker 0: Well, did we tell the funny story first about how we failed at this?

737
00:56:22,336 --> 00:56:23,180
Speaker 1: All right, tell the story.

738
00:56:23,321 --> 00:56:24,347
Speaker 0: It's Otacon related.

739
00:56:24,689 --> 00:56:27,929
Speaker 0: So about two months ago We did what.

740
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:31,388
Speaker 0: we did a bunch of stuff on Otacon The artist alley fiasco.

741
00:56:31,408 --> 00:56:43,540
Speaker 0: that happened when there was the misunderstanding and as a result we ended up talking to Jim bottles a bunch the con chair of Otacon this year and He expressed interest in having us interview him on the show and we thought this is gonna be fantastic.

742
00:56:43,661 --> 00:56:44,525
Speaker 0: The con chair of Otacon.

743
00:56:44,565 --> 00:56:45,249
Speaker 0: we get to talk to him.

744
00:56:45,269 --> 00:56:46,918
Speaker 0: We're gonna ask him so much stuff off the record.

745
00:56:46,958 --> 00:56:47,320
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

746
00:56:48,441 --> 00:56:55,272
Speaker 0: So we get him on and he doesn't want to use Skype because for various reasons Skype is good But it's also bad and he had a Mac and we had.

747
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:55,835
Speaker 0: we didn't.

748
00:56:55,875 --> 00:56:56,720
Speaker 0: we had a Mac eventually.

749
00:56:57,161 --> 00:57:01,878
Speaker 0: So we decided to try to use I chat which supposedly integrates with garage band.

750
00:57:01,978 --> 00:57:08,148
Speaker 1: Yes Theoretically if you have I chat your garage band And so it is the other person you can.

751
00:57:08,329 --> 00:57:11,300
Speaker 1: I chat with each other and garage band will record your conversation.

752
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:17,359
Speaker 1: That will fail if they have a really really old version of I chat like Jim bowels does.

753
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:21,055
Speaker 1: Now some other solutions are you can get.

754
00:57:21,075 --> 00:57:28,937
Speaker 1: I forget what the name of it is but this is telephone bridge where you can actually use an actual telephone and plug the telephone cable into something.

755
00:57:28,978 --> 00:57:32,640
Speaker 1: that then goes into your Computer and you can record it as if it was a microphone.

756
00:57:32,801 --> 00:57:36,320
Speaker 1: But it's a telephone and then you just call them on the phone and start talking.

757
00:57:36,884 --> 00:57:38,779
Speaker 0: Now the audio that way is usually pretty bad.

758
00:57:39,261 --> 00:57:46,405
Speaker 1: I think you have to know a lot about audio to make that work properly and even then just telephones in general a very Low audio quality.

759
00:57:46,445 --> 00:57:51,459
Speaker 0: I mean we did some interviews over cell phones and it was listenable, but it sounded pretty bad.

760
00:57:51,559 --> 00:57:51,940
Speaker 0: overall.

761
00:57:52,682 --> 00:58:06,039
Speaker 0: I'd say the best solution if you don't have a lot of equipment You have a lot of PCs is something called gizmo phone Which is a lot like Skype voice over IP, but it has recording built into it So you can just record the whole conversation without having to do anything special.

762
00:58:06,843 --> 00:58:14,311
Speaker 0: Skype has no built-in way to record what you're talking about and There are no really easy ways to get around that that.

763
00:58:14,471 --> 00:58:26,740
Speaker 1: your choices for recording Skype are pretty much there's like a couple programs called like hot recorder or turbo recorder or something like that and They have ads and you have to pay their shareware and they will record Skype.

764
00:58:26,967 --> 00:58:27,380
Speaker 1: They you know.

765
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:31,494
Speaker 1: You just open Skype start talking push the button in the recorder and it will record.

766
00:58:32,056 --> 00:58:33,260
Speaker 0: what some people do is they'll.

767
00:58:33,881 --> 00:58:46,788
Speaker 0: They'll do the Skype where one person records what comes out of their speakers the other person records that comes out of their speakers and then they mix it together and that is the most tedious and Terrible way you could possibly do it But a lot of podcasts do it that way.

768
00:58:46,948 --> 00:58:51,635
Speaker 1: now the correct way to record Skype is Actually somewhat difficult to set up.

769
00:58:51,756 --> 00:58:57,202
Speaker 1: audio wise I mean if you don't have you need a mixer you need a bunch of cables you need two Computers

770
00:58:57,542 --> 00:58:58,164
Speaker 2: on your end

771
00:58:58,625 --> 00:59:07,615
Speaker 1: and what you do is you have a computer that records the audio you have a computer that only does Skype and you treat the output of the computer.

772
00:59:07,635 --> 00:59:12,860
Speaker 1: that does Skype as You know a person with a microphone and you plug them into your mixer.

773
00:59:13,302 --> 00:59:22,335
Speaker 1: The thing is you then have to send back what you say to the Skype computer So the person can hear you talking without sending them back what they say.

774
00:59:22,536 --> 00:59:27,272
Speaker 1: because then you know If they talk it comes into your computer then goes back out to them.

775
00:59:27,312 --> 00:59:29,900
Speaker 1: They hear everything they say and it really screws it up.

776
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,364
Speaker 1: So you need a mixer.

777
00:59:31,384 --> 00:59:34,113
Speaker 1: I need to fiddle with the auxilary settings and it's.

778
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:38,160
Speaker 0: there's no way I can explain easily Without showing you how to do it.

779
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:43,894
Speaker 0: But after the panel anyone wants to see come on up and I'll show you exactly How we do that and where the cables go and how it all works.

780
00:59:43,995 --> 00:59:44,920
Speaker 1: There is an episode.

781
00:59:45,061 --> 00:59:48,593
Speaker 1: There is a TV show I think I'm revision 3.com or whatever.

782
00:59:48,633 --> 00:59:52,424
Speaker 1: the URL is called system Systm and they have.

783
00:59:52,605 --> 00:59:57,103
Speaker 1: there was an episode where they went to this guy Leo Laporte who's a big-time Podcasting guy.

784
00:59:57,123 --> 01:00:05,200
Speaker 1: they went to his house and he showed everyone like the ISDN box He had and this giant mixer and how he set up Skype and that's how we figured out how to do it.

785
01:00:05,281 --> 01:00:06,498
Speaker 1: We saw exactly what he did.

786
01:00:07,428 --> 01:00:24,132
Speaker 1: my question is When it comes to Group environments where you have multiple people talking in a room at the same time You have a group discussion and you can't get individuals up to the microphone one at a time Do you have an arrangement for that a solution for that?

787
01:00:24,192 --> 01:00:25,457
Speaker 1: Well, there are two ways.

788
01:00:25,477 --> 01:00:33,080
Speaker 0: Well, actually we had a lot of experience with that last night and Generally, I mean we do the show together.

789
01:00:33,181 --> 01:00:38,857
Speaker 0: We also live together in college for a long time A lot of listeners seem to think that we are gay which was kind of Larry's.

790
01:00:38,877 --> 01:00:39,943
Speaker 1: we're not gay We're just.

791
01:00:40,366 --> 01:00:41,573
Speaker 0: well, what was the term from clerks?

792
01:00:42,257 --> 01:00:57,440
Speaker 0: I don't know But we've been friends for so long and actually all these people that we know too when we record a show We just we have these cues and even for all in the room together talking It's really no big deal in terms of cutting people off.

793
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,890
Speaker 0: There's just kind of this vibe and flow and especially us.

794
01:00:59,931 --> 01:01:03,928
Speaker 0: when we get a third person on our show as a guest They can't get a word in edgewise.

795
01:01:04,169 --> 01:01:06,520
Speaker 0: we have to force ourselves to shut up and let them talk.

796
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:14,820
Speaker 1: Yes, some people like invited us onto their podcasts and you know inviting one of us is okay But if they invite both of us, it basically becomes an episode of our show.

797
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:21,476
Speaker 0: Yeah What we were with them is the guess we appeared on what geek speak and it was just us talking to each other for an Hour and him kind of like.

798
01:01:21,759 --> 01:01:24,943
Speaker 1: yeah Yeah, if you want to record a group There's two ways you could do it.

799
01:01:24,983 --> 01:01:29,677
Speaker 1: number one you get a mixer and a whole bunch of microphones one for everybody.

800
01:01:29,778 --> 01:01:31,724
Speaker 0: again money can Every problem.

801
01:01:32,286 --> 01:01:37,384
Speaker 1: number two you can get I haven't actually found one yet up for sale But you can get them.

802
01:01:37,504 --> 01:01:45,620
Speaker 1: there are these omni directional mics that you can put in the middle of a table that you know They use them for like teleconferencing and offices and things and if you get one of those it might call.

803
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:46,486
Speaker 1: I don't know how much they cost.

804
01:01:46,506 --> 01:01:47,453
Speaker 1: They're probably a lot of money.

805
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:53,684
Speaker 1: 60 70 bucks Yes But if they if you get one of those you put it in the middle of table and you Everyone's voice will come through.

806
01:01:53,744 --> 01:01:58,360
Speaker 1: the quality won't be amazing, but it'll be decent enough to share with everyone.

807
01:01:58,442 --> 01:02:00,966
Speaker 0: It'll be pretty bad Over all things considered.

808
01:02:01,508 --> 01:02:03,234
Speaker 1: It'll sound like an office teleconference.

809
01:02:03,535 --> 01:02:04,680
Speaker 0: I mean generally what we did.

810
01:02:05,023 --> 01:02:06,700
Speaker 0: I think the best will just what we did last night.

811
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:10,514
Speaker 0: We had a whole bunch of people trying to be on our show and we only had three.

812
01:02:10,875 --> 01:02:15,450
Speaker 0: see there are two kinds of microphones Basically, they're omni directional and uni directional.

813
01:02:16,112 --> 01:02:20,967
Speaker 0: now an omni directional mic records the same Volume from any direction.

814
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:24,320
Speaker 0: so you stick it in the middle of four people and they can just all kind of talk at it.

815
01:02:24,461 --> 01:02:28,946
Speaker 0: Or you hand it to someone and if they don't know how to hold a microphone It doesn't matter how they're holding it.

816
01:02:28,986 --> 01:02:29,909
Speaker 0: They'll still sound the same.

817
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:33,380
Speaker 0: The problem is it picks up all the noise in the room.

818
01:02:33,581 --> 01:02:36,258
Speaker 0: so if someone's you know fiddling with something in the corner, it'll pick that up too.

819
01:02:36,278 --> 01:02:41,340
Speaker 0: and Unidirectional mics really only pick up sound from essentially one direction.

820
01:02:41,501 --> 01:02:46,860
Speaker 0: So you have to point it very specifically at yourself in a certain way And it won't pick up any noise.

821
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:53,292
Speaker 0: Like if I had a unidirectional mic and Scott's talking to me Scott wouldn't even get picked up on the mic, but I would be picked up perfectly.

822
01:02:53,312 --> 01:02:55,099
Speaker 1: These are unidirectional.

823
01:02:55,119 --> 01:03:01,580
Speaker 1: So if I But if it was omni directional you'd still be able to hear me if I was like this side of it.

824
01:03:02,123 --> 01:03:10,280
Speaker 0: So what we did is we had the three unidirectional mics and we gave those two I guess the three people we thought were the coolest or whoever had the best voices and then everyone else.

825
01:03:10,701 --> 01:03:16,944
Speaker 0: We just stuck one omni directional mic and we recorded that on a separate track Because it was so noisy.

826
01:03:17,406 --> 01:03:21,440
Speaker 0: and then what I can do in post-production now is the three people on the good mics.

827
01:03:21,581 --> 01:03:29,274
Speaker 0: I just throw them in and then I only bring in the track from the other omni directional mic When people on that track are talking and otherwise I quash it out.

828
01:03:29,334 --> 01:03:39,100
Speaker 0: so no the noise comes through In terms of dealing with a bunch of people as in terms of who talks when You just have to designate someone as the moderator.

829
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:42,874
Speaker 0: I mean we had I basically did the whole first roundtable.

830
01:03:42,894 --> 01:03:44,300
Speaker 0: we did Scott wasn't in the room so much.

831
01:03:44,703 --> 01:03:46,640
Speaker 0: So I moderated the whole thing, you know, I asked people questions.

832
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:48,587
Speaker 0: I would cut people off if they were talking too long.

833
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:51,879
Speaker 0: then when we did the thing where you know, the assassination attempt occurred.

834
01:03:53,793 --> 01:03:55,200
Speaker 0: We Scott we were tired.

835
01:03:55,280 --> 01:04:01,174
Speaker 0: So Scott and I just kind of did it and there's really no true moderator and it kind of descended into chaos until we got shot.

836
01:04:02,962 --> 01:04:06,120
Speaker 0: But in general it if you ever want to have a whole bunch of people recorded.

837
01:04:06,562 --> 01:04:13,772
Speaker 0: Someone needs to be the moderator someone you everyone needs to agree that they will take that person's direction No matter what they say until the recording stops.

838
01:04:14,133 --> 01:04:18,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean some podcasts, you know Don't have a moderator and everyone's polite and they know each other.

839
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:20,990
Speaker 1: So they know, you know only talk at once.

840
01:04:21,071 --> 01:04:27,079
Speaker 1: if people are interrupting each other or talking over each other It becomes unlistenable because you know one person just keep talking over each other.

841
01:04:27,202 --> 01:04:30,994
Speaker 1: Yeah Well one person is this loud and another person is exactly as loud.

842
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:35,126
Speaker 1: if they both talk at the same time It gets double loud and not good.

843
01:04:37,632 --> 01:04:38,073
Speaker 0: I can't believe.

844
01:04:38,093 --> 01:04:38,914
Speaker 0: that's all the questions.

845
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:39,295
Speaker 0: No.

846
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:40,278
Speaker 1: No, I've got the mic.

847
01:04:41,019 --> 01:04:46,480
Speaker 0: Ah Understand that hosting and the RSS feed is basically an art form.

848
01:04:46,701 --> 01:04:51,520
Speaker 1: Constantly developing sounds like two of you are having far more fun than should be allowed.

849
01:04:51,922 --> 01:04:54,679
Speaker 1: Did you share with us some of your experiences with that?

850
01:04:55,900 --> 01:05:07,140
Speaker 1: Okay, what I do is we have hosting from a company called line ode which is not for the faint of heart If you cannot administer a Linux system on your own do not get a line ode.

851
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:19,364
Speaker 1: But I have a line ode because I can do that and what I did is install the patchy the web server PHP, you know the programming language system and WordPress WordPress.

852
01:05:19,564 --> 01:05:27,339
Speaker 1: if you make a blog post in WordPress and you link to an mp3 It will automatically make the RSS feed and the enclosure and do everything for you.

853
01:05:27,922 --> 01:05:34,900
Speaker 1: If you don't want to you can go to wordpress.com and get your own WordPress blog But your URL is going to be something dot wordpress.com.

854
01:05:35,742 --> 01:05:44,419
Speaker 1: Then what we did is you need special things in your feed for iTunes to recognize it because iTunes is screwed up And they like to do their own thing.

855
01:05:45,265 --> 01:05:58,191
Speaker 1: so if you want iTunes and Apple to recognize You know all the information about your podcast and you want them to put your podcast in their directory properly You need to add all this stuff to your feed Which there's two ways you can do it.

856
01:05:58,252 --> 01:06:02,858
Speaker 1: if you're using WordPress number one you can get a WordPress plug-in that allows you to do it.

857
01:06:02,878 --> 01:06:05,460
Speaker 1: or You can use feed burner.

858
01:06:05,661 --> 01:06:06,664
Speaker 1: What feed burner does?

859
01:06:06,684 --> 01:06:10,096
Speaker 1: is they provide a service where you give them an RSS feed.

860
01:06:10,116 --> 01:06:10,878
Speaker 1: then they?

861
01:06:11,642 --> 01:06:20,131
Speaker 1: Tidy up your RSS feed into something perfect And then you share the feed burner feed with everyone because you know that one always works Just fine, and that's that's what we do.

862
01:06:20,533 --> 01:06:20,674
Speaker 0: Yeah.

863
01:06:20,715 --> 01:06:21,480
Speaker 0: They're very good.

864
01:06:21,621 --> 01:06:27,038
Speaker 0: I mean, I'd say I'm not quite the majority of podcasts now Or it's moving to feed burner just because it's so easy.

865
01:06:27,802 --> 01:06:34,050
Speaker 0: I mean like we're Linux admins and all that and dealing with email is such a pain that we just use Gmail And it's kind of the same deal.

866
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:35,399
Speaker 0: It's a pain to deal with RSS.

867
01:06:36,221 --> 01:06:40,120
Speaker 0: So if you just use feed burner they take over everything for you, and you don't have to worry about all that.

868
01:06:40,342 --> 01:06:44,628
Speaker 1: There are a lot of people out there who are scarily Manually editing their RSS feeds.

869
01:06:44,768 --> 01:06:48,220
Speaker 1: if you're manually editing your RSS feed you are doing something wrong.

870
01:06:48,321 --> 01:06:54,300
Speaker 1: You should have a piece of software that is doing that for you automatically Or else I don't know why you're wasting your time.

871
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:59,059
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean the RSS exists to make podcasting or anything like this easier to do not harder to do.

872
01:06:59,842 --> 01:07:06,380
Speaker 1: And as for the hosting there are a lot more companies now used to be just Libsyn really But now there's a whole bunch of competitors.

873
01:07:06,581 --> 01:07:22,486
Speaker 1: I think that pod show company has something and there's a few others and The way they seem to work for podcasts is you can upload so many megabytes of podcasts per month and then infinity downloads Which is which is good because you know if you get a hundred million listeners all of a sudden You don't want to be screwed.

874
01:07:22,888 --> 01:07:25,080
Speaker 0: Yep, and they keep your archives as long as you keep paying them.

875
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:26,452
Speaker 0: so everything stays up forever.

876
01:07:26,472 --> 01:07:32,300
Speaker 0: and All told we spend about a hundred and twenty dollars a month on all of our hosting.

877
01:07:32,621 --> 01:07:39,502
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think our Libsyn is 40 bucks and the line out hosting is 80 bucks But in terms of anyone else out there I mean one.

878
01:07:39,803 --> 01:07:47,172
Speaker 0: we do four shows a week, and they're all about an hour long - we record pretty high quality and we use 96 kilobits per second.

879
01:07:47,634 --> 01:08:01,860
Speaker 0: for various reasons and For anyone else out there who isn't insane like we are If you do like a weekly or a monthly podcast you could easily get away with spending ten or fifteen dollars a month and be Perfectly fine and ready to go in case you get slashed on it or parked or something.

880
01:08:02,101 --> 01:08:05,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, Libsyn actually provides a total podcasting solution.

881
01:08:05,421 --> 01:08:10,440
Speaker 1: So if you're not doing a whole lot of podcasting you can just pay them and everything will work.

882
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:11,865
Speaker 1: You won't need any other hosts.

883
01:08:11,925 --> 01:08:12,889
Speaker 1: You won't need anything else.

884
01:08:12,929 --> 01:08:15,740
Speaker 1: You'll probably need a domain name from someone, but that's about it.

885
01:08:16,081 --> 01:08:21,979
Speaker 0: I don't personally terribly recommend using Libsyn for that because their technological service is very good.

886
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:30,630
Speaker 0: Their customer support is kind of lacking and if you don't know about the technology and you need help Libsyn generally can't provide it very easily or very well.

887
01:08:31,171 --> 01:08:32,676
Speaker 1: It's sort of like using GarageBand.

888
01:08:32,716 --> 01:08:33,420
Speaker 1: You know it works.

889
01:08:33,761 --> 01:08:37,560
Speaker 1: It's everything in one, but at the same time you can't really do anything with it.

890
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:40,479
Speaker 1: You're trapped inside the noobs world the low end.

891
01:08:41,182 --> 01:08:46,727
Speaker 0: I generally recommend using WordPress in some form either on whatever hosting you already have or WordPress.com.

892
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:50,466
Speaker 0: it's easy to use you'll learn a lot And it's really the best solution.

893
01:08:50,506 --> 01:08:51,169
Speaker 0: as far as I can see.

894
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:55,265
Speaker 1: there are other blog softwares that are just as good like movable Type or type.

895
01:08:55,386 --> 01:08:56,470
Speaker 1: I don't know what they're called.

896
01:08:56,712 --> 01:08:58,139
Speaker 1: I don't use them, but they're out there.

897
01:09:00,082 --> 01:09:00,344
Speaker 1: Hey guys.

898
01:09:00,365 --> 01:09:02,076
Speaker 1: Hey, what's up um?

899
01:09:02,899 --> 01:09:06,009
Speaker 1: By podcast we use Skype and Audacity.

900
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:19,676
Speaker 1: simply because one of our new one of our hosts is in England and The other programs don't work so well over there We're running into a problem rather severe problem where two of us there are four of us total.

901
01:09:19,796 --> 01:09:28,663
Speaker 1: two of us sound great The other two sound awful, and if we put it into a car they become unhearable There.

902
01:09:29,145 --> 01:09:32,138
Speaker 0: it's always twos with us apparently, but there are two things that cause that.

903
01:09:33,261 --> 01:09:41,555
Speaker 0: Early on we record everything where we can coded everything to 64 kilobit per second mp3s which is pretty much as low as you would ever want to go for voice.

904
01:09:41,575 --> 01:09:48,218
Speaker 0: and Because of the way our levels are we didn't realize that you know listening to our masters everything that I mean.

905
01:09:48,238 --> 01:10:04,133
Speaker 0: it sounded pretty good to us, but then one of our listeners told us one day that in the car we sound like two robots killing each other and Those are basically the artifacts from encoding something to an mp3 or in skype's case What skype uses to compress the audio to send it across.

906
01:10:04,816 --> 01:10:05,700
Speaker 0: the best solution?

907
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:11,680
Speaker 0: I mean in terms of encoding you can't do much about Skype because Skype changes how it encodes depend on your bandwidth.

908
01:10:12,143 --> 01:10:14,699
Speaker 0: So there's nothing you can do about that except buy more bandwidth.

909
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:26,000
Speaker 0: in Terms of dealing with the fact that they sound bad the best thing you can really do is have them on two separate tracks and Then do a separate set of filters to the bad sounding one to try to smooth it out a little.

910
01:10:26,261 --> 01:10:29,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, also two guys sound bad and two guys sound fine.

911
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,628
Speaker 1: There's probably something wrong with their end.

912
01:10:30,668 --> 01:10:32,960
Speaker 1: Maybe they have a sound card with a lot of noise on it.

913
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:35,128
Speaker 1: Maybe they didn't set their levels properly.

914
01:10:35,469 --> 01:10:38,480
Speaker 0: I think it sounds like his problem is very specifically an encoding issue.

915
01:10:38,741 --> 01:10:42,536
Speaker 0: Yeah, because that kind of noise really only comes up when you're compressing something.

916
01:10:42,557 --> 01:10:45,605
Speaker 1: all right MP3 before you upload.

917
01:10:46,027 --> 01:10:49,780
Speaker 1: you should probably upload all the waves and combine them and make an MP.

918
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,889
Speaker 0: You never want to transcode anything.

919
01:10:51,929 --> 01:10:52,673
Speaker 0: I mean real.

920
01:10:52,693 --> 01:10:55,628
Speaker 0: briefly in case anyone isn't fully aware of this There are two ways always two.

921
01:10:56,333 --> 01:11:04,258
Speaker 0: you can encode audio losslessly like in flack or essentially a wave file where it's perfect or an mp3 where it's small because it's lossy.

922
01:11:04,358 --> 01:11:05,582
Speaker 0: information is Destroyed.

923
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:09,092
Speaker 0: if you encode something to mp3 some information is lost.

924
01:11:09,694 --> 01:11:13,108
Speaker 0: if you encode that to an mp3 again More is lost.

925
01:11:13,550 --> 01:11:17,027
Speaker 0: so if you encode to mp3 upload it And then he makes an mp3 from that.

926
01:11:17,449 --> 01:11:25,388
Speaker 0: that is probably where almost all of your problems are coming from Especially if he's using a bitrate less than 96 It's just like if you ever use Photoshop.

927
01:11:25,408 --> 01:11:27,756
Speaker 1: you want to do everything in what the PSD format.

928
01:11:27,796 --> 01:11:32,460
Speaker 1: that is completely lossless Until the very last minute you make your JPEG or your paying or your gift.

929
01:11:32,922 --> 01:11:33,423
Speaker 1: It's the same thing.

930
01:11:33,443 --> 01:11:38,983
Speaker 1: you want to keep everything as a wave file, or if you're using an Apple they have those lossless Files.

931
01:11:39,023 --> 01:11:45,420
Speaker 1: yeah, whatever they're called you want to make everything you know lossless until the very last minute you make your mp3 or your AAC.

932
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:47,123
Speaker 1: Anyone else?

933
01:11:47,785 --> 01:11:52,581
Speaker 0: we're almost out of time, so I have a question about the new video Podcasts.

934
01:11:52,902 --> 01:11:57,059
Speaker 0: I know you guys aren't too involved, but I'm guessing that you know more than most.

935
01:11:57,361 --> 01:12:00,477
Speaker 0: We've been debating doing it and the only limiting factor is money.

936
01:12:00,518 --> 01:12:04,674
Speaker 0: at this point The only video podcast I watch is ask a ninja.

937
01:12:05,176 --> 01:12:07,216
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean Think of it.

938
01:12:07,843 --> 01:12:13,320
Speaker 1: I'm listening to the audio podcast because while I work I'm a computer programmer so I could sit in work and listen at the same time.

939
01:12:13,421 --> 01:12:14,689
Speaker 1: It was a video podcast.

940
01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:16,400
Speaker 1: you know I'd have to stop work.

941
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:21,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I work in the Bronx, and I live an hour north of it So I drive to work an hour one way every day.

942
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:23,460
Speaker 0: I can listen to podcasts in the car just fine.

943
01:12:24,043 --> 01:12:25,471
Speaker 0: I can't watch a movie in the car.

944
01:12:25,491 --> 01:12:25,632
Speaker 0: Well.

945
01:12:25,692 --> 01:12:26,396
Speaker 0: I can but it's fine.

946
01:12:26,416 --> 01:12:29,684
Speaker 0: I have a good idea But in turn I mean it.

947
01:12:30,066 --> 01:12:36,352
Speaker 0: video podcasting is really I don't think going to take off soon because It's really just the barrier to entry and the amount of effort.

948
01:12:36,814 --> 01:12:42,084
Speaker 0: I mean think you've got blogging podcasts video casts and Blogging.

949
01:12:42,104 --> 01:12:43,579
Speaker 0: the barrier to entry is really small.

950
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:45,166
Speaker 0: I mean blogs are free.

951
01:12:45,628 --> 01:12:48,720
Speaker 0: all you have to do is type whenever it takes almost no effort.

952
01:12:48,801 --> 01:12:50,794
Speaker 0: Just type whatever you want audio now.

953
01:12:50,815 --> 01:12:51,600
Speaker 0: You know this equipment.

954
01:12:51,741 --> 01:12:52,806
Speaker 0: You need to learn about audio.

955
01:12:52,826 --> 01:13:03,939
Speaker 0: you need to actually sit down and record the audio Usually late at night when I need to go to bed because I've worked in the morning And Pardon me now, and you have to worry about the noise in the room and all that video.

956
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:13,171
Speaker 0: now You also have to worry about lighting about bandwidth about makeup about all these other things, and it's just it becomes an Exponentially increasing amount of effort.

957
01:13:13,292 --> 01:13:18,474
Speaker 1: yeah, I mean with audio You know the mp3 is gonna work on everyone's computer pretty much if you use video.

958
01:13:18,494 --> 01:13:21,972
Speaker 1: you got to worry about the mpeg 4s What's it called the h.264?

959
01:13:23,284 --> 01:13:24,730
Speaker 1: And the iPod formats.

01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:30,613
Speaker 1: at the PSP formats the Divix the expid There's so many different video formats the QuickTime the windows media.

961
01:13:31,236 --> 01:13:33,468
Speaker 1: It's really just a pain in the butt I think.

962
01:13:33,488 --> 01:13:34,758
Speaker 0: maybe give it three or four years.

963
01:13:34,798 --> 01:13:39,299
Speaker 0: video Podcasting is bandwidth increases as long as you know the internet isn't made up of a series of tubes.

964
01:13:41,541 --> 01:13:48,039
Speaker 1: Yeah as digital cameras get cheaper and as Google turns on more dark fiber you're gonna see a lot more video podcasting.

965
01:13:50,071 --> 01:13:53,190
Speaker 1: All right, I think we're out of time anyway, so we're not on time just yet.

Speaker 0: We got to wind down.

967
01:13:54,498 --> 01:13:56,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think we have any more questions.

968
01:13:57,412 --> 01:14:02,907
Speaker 0: I guess at this point everyone who does a podcast come on up here And we'll well yell and scream and be if someone will take a picture.

Speaker 0: we've been around for about a year.

999
01:15:49,317 --> 01:15:53,853
Speaker 0: so after a year We finally figured out how to use like microphones and mixers and stuff.

1000
01:15:54,415 --> 01:15:55,780
Speaker 0: so now it sounds pretty good.

1001
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:59,480
Speaker 0: So if you haven't listened in a long time you check it out and some guy offered to build this web page.

1002
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:01,367
Speaker 0: So the web page also looks pretty good.

1003
01:16:01,808 --> 01:16:04,097
Speaker 0: I really recommend the anime world order podcast.

1004
01:16:04,258 --> 01:16:04,900
Speaker 1: They're pretty awesome.

1005
01:16:05,404 --> 01:16:07,037
Speaker 1: They came out like last December or something.

1006
01:16:09,943 --> 01:16:16,520
Speaker 1: Most of our listeners are fifth graders, so They're either like fifth graders and junior high kids or parents.

1007
01:16:17,601 --> 01:16:22,460
Speaker 1: So if you are a fifth grader or no fifth graders, I understand that fifth graders like our podcast.

1014
01:16:40,381 --> 01:16:48,349
Speaker 1: my podcast is a taco generation and We've been doing for about a year and Darryl contributes a lot so that they hear his voice quite a bit.

1015
01:16:49,871 --> 01:16:51,576
Speaker 1: And we're we're pretty old-school.

1016
01:16:51,957 --> 01:16:58,441
Speaker 1: I'm the only one represented out of the 10 of us 10 15 of us that Normally do our podcast every week.

1017
01:16:58,582 --> 01:17:03,807
Speaker 1: and because they're all lame They have something else like you know life to do or something like that.

1018
01:17:04,209 --> 01:17:06,487
Speaker 1: actually I think it's Otacon has burned them out completely.

1019
01:17:06,588 --> 01:17:09,143
Speaker 1: so And since we're old school.

1020
01:17:09,203 --> 01:17:14,350
Speaker 1: We're all old guys So you know they can't get out of their rocker chairs that come to them to con stuff.

1024
01:17:25,797 --> 01:17:34,650
Speaker 0: See I didn't really warn him But you learn a lot about audio and the first thing you'll learn when you start doing live shows anywhere Is that you never walk in front of those big things because they'll hurt you.

1025
01:17:34,690 --> 01:17:39,750
Speaker 0: I Marcus noble I host the skunk smells podcast.

Speaker 1: There aren't.

1055
01:19:06,864 --> 01:19:13,296
Speaker 1: there are a lot of podcasts covering weird things like I said Australian real estate But there are a lot of things that there isn't a podcast for them like.

1056
01:19:13,316 --> 01:19:14,200
Speaker 1: I don't think you know.

1057
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:17,038
Speaker 1: There's no podcast about like lens men there.

1058
01:19:18,763 --> 01:19:25,580
Speaker 0: If you know something if there's something you're an expert at there's something you're passionate about You could do a podcast so easily and anyone else.

1059
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:28,799
Speaker 0: It's a great way to meet people who are interested in the same weird things you're interested in.

1060
01:19:29,381 --> 01:19:44,656
Speaker 0: I mean my favorite podcast other than geek nights right now that I listen to is called 12 Byzantine emperors And it's just this guy talking about 12 emperors from the ancient empire of Byzantine and Byzantium and all that is actually Rome Which I just learned.

1061
01:19:52,004 --> 01:19:56,889
Speaker 0: And I just like to say that it's really Podcasting is really seems to be starting to take off.

1062
01:19:56,929 --> 01:19:59,758
Speaker 0: I mean last year at Otacon there was practically no podcasting.

1063

1065
01:20:06,941 --> 01:20:13,696
Speaker 0: There's probably going to be a podcasting party that I'm sure all of us will have something to do with and I'm sure there will Be some sort of trouble occurring.

1066
01:20:15,741 --> 01:20:20,439
Speaker 0: Clown pistol related the fact that he yelled six semper tyrannous before he shot me.
