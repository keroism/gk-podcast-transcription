1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,140
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, October 6th, 2021.

2
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,670
Speaker 0: I'm Rym, and I'm Scott, and this is Geek Nights.

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:20,490
Speaker 0: Tonight, we review, without spoilers, the Evangelion rebuild movies.

4
00:00:21,532 --> 00:00:22,548
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:23,611 --> 00:00:27,090
Speaker 0: I guess vague spoilers about what Evangelion as a whole is about.

6
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:29,089
Speaker 1: Maybe.

7
00:00:31,012 --> 00:00:34,170
Speaker 0: There's a little bit of a statute of limitations on that show overall.

8
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:40,567
Speaker 0: Normally, this is the point where we do a little opening bit and talk about, like, "Oh, what happened on the bike ride and what we did this

9
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:40,950
Speaker 0: weekend?".

10
00:00:41,051 --> 00:00:43,022
Speaker 0: But nothing happened in the last two days.

11
00:00:43,606 --> 00:00:44,210
Speaker 0: There's nothing to us.

12
00:00:44,754 --> 00:00:46,809
Speaker 1: No, it's been rather uninteresting over here.

13
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:54,029
Speaker 0: Between the last show and this show, I played Blades in the Dark online all night, and I did two days of work.

14
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:55,593
Speaker 1: I worked.

15
00:00:55,937 --> 00:00:56,543
Speaker 1: I ate food.

16
00:00:56,563 --> 00:00:57,149
Speaker 1: I slept.

17
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:02,330
Speaker 1: I rode my bike to nowhere up a virtual French mountain.

18
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:03,790
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

19
00:01:06,574 --> 00:01:09,930
Speaker 0: One thing I can say is I noticed something about my body from this hike.

20
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:13,056
Speaker 0: It's about weight.

21
00:01:13,297 --> 00:01:16,150
Speaker 0: Not body weight, but physical weight.

22
00:01:16,971 --> 00:01:19,682
Speaker 0: I'll run 15 miles and feel fine.

23
00:01:19,702 --> 00:01:22,507
Speaker 0: I'll bike 100 miles and just be a little sore, and then fine the next day.

24
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:30,749
Speaker 0: When I normally hike, I can hike 10 to 15 miles without any soreness, and 15 to 25 miles, I'm achy at the end of it.

25
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:42,590
Speaker 0: But hiking with a heavy pack actually makes my knees hurt at the end of the day, whereas more strenuous activity without that pack does not.

26
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:53,289
Speaker 0: And I think it comes down solely to the fact that when you think about it, when I run and do all these other things, my muscles also get stronger and bigger, and changes happen in my body.

27
00:01:54,874 --> 00:01:58,590
Speaker 0: But bones and knees are mostly just bones and knees, and ligaments are just ligaments.

28
00:01:58,771 --> 00:02:04,090
Speaker 0: You can't make a ligament just bigger or stronger like you can the muscles around it.

29
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:13,928
Speaker 0: So that bottleneck, having that extra 30 pounds on my back, is a big goddamn deal to the parts of my body that are the least able to be trained or improved in any way.

30
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,269
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know anything about that.

31
00:02:17,212 --> 00:02:20,470
Speaker 1: I'm not an orthopedist or whatever the correct doctor is.

32
00:02:21,537 --> 00:02:22,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was thinking which ones which over there.

33
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:23,620
Speaker 1: It makes common sense.

34
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,229
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah.

35
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just something I didn't really think about.

36
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,740
Speaker 0: It's like, all right, I can hike 20 miles.

37
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,108
Speaker 0: I'll put out a pack and I'll hike 20 miles.

38
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,590
Speaker 0: I'll just be more tired.

39
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,770
Speaker 0: And now, I actually wasn't more tired at all, but my knees hurt.

40
00:02:35,018 --> 00:02:35,909
Speaker 0: I also couldn't run.

41
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,390
Speaker 0: You could feel my knees being like, nope, do not do that when you're this heavy.

42
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,030
Speaker 1: You've got a big load on your back.

43
00:02:42,853 --> 00:02:52,769
Speaker 1: If you go on a long bike ride, even if you get off and feel totally fine, like you don't feel achy or anything, if you try to walk up some stairs immediately after, you wobble, wobble, wobble.

44
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,267
Speaker 0: Yep, yep, yep.

45
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,500
Speaker 0: But the other thing that was interesting is when I was wearing those really fancy backpacks.

46
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,150
Speaker 0: When I was a kid, I didn't have a fancy backpack like modern technology.

47
00:03:03,711 --> 00:03:06,010
Speaker 1: Also, some of those didn't exist, even if you had all the money.

48
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:06,710
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, that's what I'm saying.

49
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:13,785
Speaker 0: The hiking backpacks today are materially different, kind of like how skis are different in the 21st century.

50
00:03:16,472 --> 00:03:23,167
Speaker 0: So, the thing that was really interesting about wearing that heavy pack was that it didn't feel like any weight at all, other than the knee thing, like when you're wearing it.

51
00:03:23,892 --> 00:03:28,130
Speaker 0: Unless you lean to the side at all, and then suddenly you feel all that weight all at once.

52
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,989
Speaker 0: Like you gotta stay kind of straight up, or suddenly you feel it all.

53
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,781
Speaker 1: Uh oh, I don't stand up straight.

54
00:03:34,801 --> 00:03:36,210
Speaker 1: I don't look like dynamite.

55
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:39,856
Speaker 0: So yeah, we'll get right into it.

56
00:03:40,097 --> 00:03:49,290
Speaker 0: Normally, anime news, manga news, comic news, but we had a whole bunch of big news on Monday, and the news train continued.

57
00:03:49,651 --> 00:03:50,716
Speaker 0: We cannot talk about this.

58
00:03:51,037 --> 00:03:54,330
Speaker 0: There was a massive leak at Twitch.

59
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,990
Speaker 0: Like this is huge news that we're still just barely unpacking.

60
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,810
Speaker 0: We've barely even unpacked all the stuff we talked about on Monday.

61
00:04:03,111 --> 00:04:20,809
Speaker 0: So, what we know is that Twitch, someone leaked, not just like password hashes, or like all the baby stuff that gets leaked all the time, it appears that they leaked the entire source code for Twitch, including like change logs and multiple versions of a lot of things.

62
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,358
Speaker 0: Entire databases of just raw information.

63
00:04:26,461 --> 00:04:29,770
Speaker 0: I saw talk of two-factor secrets were even leaked.

64
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,950
Speaker 0: Raw passwords were not leaked, I don't think, but hashes were.

65
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,022
Speaker 1: Well, so supposedly, there was one dump.

66
00:04:37,523 --> 00:04:39,049
Speaker 1: The dump was confirmed, legit.

67
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,469
Speaker 1: It was actually a dump.

68
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:46,630
Speaker 0: Ferg confirmed it at 7.30am yesterday, and then Twitch also confirmed it was legit a few hours later.

69
00:04:46,630 --> 00:05:03,510
Speaker 1: But it was supposedly part one, so the only things that were actually in part one that seemed to have leaked is the source code of Twitch, its entire Git repository, which includes the entire history of the Git repository.

70
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:14,070
Speaker 1: So you could presumably check out, you know, Twitch 1.0 from 2000-whatever, and try to run it on who knows what hardware, if I don't think that's going to be possible.

71
00:05:15,793 --> 00:05:43,130
Speaker 1: And also, some data that included something related to the payouts people get, you know, the earnings of streamers, but that data looks, at least, I haven't seen the original data because I'm not downloading some shady leak from Fortune, but the people have so processed that data via some unknown means and published it without much annotation describing what the numbers are.

72
00:05:44,993 --> 00:05:46,240
Speaker 1: And it doesn't have a lot of meaning.

73
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,346
Speaker 1: what people have tweeted, right?

74
00:05:48,891 --> 00:06:06,930
Speaker 0: It's a situation where people are coming in hot with hot takes about data they've looked at, but the serious people, like the journalists who are going through this data and methodically analyzing it, it's going to be a little while before we get really verified explanations of the full extent of this data.

75
00:06:07,271 --> 00:06:16,124
Speaker 1: Regardless, any claims of any data other than that, other than the source code repository and some data-- Well, actually, so here's the official list.

76
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:16,789
Speaker 0: This is confirmed.

77
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,889
Speaker 0: This is what is in the leak tube right now.

78
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:26,830
Speaker 0: Three years of creator payouts with the asterisk that we don't exactly know what those numbers represent specifically.

79
00:06:28,092 --> 00:06:31,870
Speaker 0: The entirety of Twitch TV with commit history going back to nearly the beginning.

80
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,290
Speaker 0: The source code for the mobile, desktop, and video game console Twitch clients.

81
00:06:37,452 --> 00:06:41,490
Speaker 0: Code related to all the proprietary SDKs and internal AWS services used by Twitch.

82
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:46,010
Speaker 0: An unreleased Steam competitor from Amazon Game Studios.

83
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:47,410
Speaker 1: Right.

84
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:52,110
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, so they did, they do or did, or maybe still do have like a Twitch app.

85
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:58,249
Speaker 1: And if you get free games from Twitch because you have Twitch Prime, that's the app you need to get those games.

86
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:03,630
Speaker 1: So that's, I don't know why they're calling it like some unreleased secret Steam competitor.

87
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,839
Speaker 1: There is a Steam competitor from Twitch.

88
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:06,622
Speaker 1: It's the Twitch app.

89
00:07:06,763 --> 00:07:08,410
Speaker 1: It has, you can download games in it.

90
00:07:09,274 --> 00:07:10,080
Speaker 1: It has a library.

91
00:07:10,101 --> 00:07:11,270
Speaker 1: It does what Steam does.

92
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,870
Speaker 0: I did read a little more about this, but there's still, people are still investigating it.

93
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:21,230
Speaker 0: But the claim is that what it is, if you look at it, is something that is not available and out there.

94
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:25,630
Speaker 1: Like it has other-- It's probably like a rebranded, upgraded, who knows what.

95
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,950
Speaker 1: But all of these things are under the umbrella of the source code repositories from Twitch.

96
00:07:30,211 --> 00:07:34,970
Speaker 0: Oh, also a whole bunch of raw data that hasn't been analyzed yet on IGDB and CurseForge.

97
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,375
Speaker 0: Other Twitch properties.

98
00:07:37,395 --> 00:07:40,089
Speaker 0: There's other things Twitch owns that I don't interact with.

99
00:07:40,691 --> 00:07:47,090
Speaker 0: And all of Twitch's internal security tools, including their red team penetration test suites.

100
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,292
Speaker 1: Right.

101
00:07:48,312 --> 00:07:50,110
Speaker 1: So all their source codes, all their software.

102
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:50,530
Speaker 0: Yup.

103
00:07:51,092 --> 00:07:58,630
Speaker 0: So we don't know much more yet, but if you have a Twitch account, I highly recommend you change your password.

104
00:07:59,072 --> 00:08:02,770
Speaker 0: And if you have two-factor authentication, disable it and re-enable it.

105
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:16,029
Speaker 1: And beyond that-- Of course, there hasn't been any confirmed truth to the fact that anything in the Twitch SQL database presumably has been compromised in any way.

106
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:16,519
Speaker 0: Yup.

107
00:08:18,691 --> 00:08:27,070
Speaker 1: But they did say it was leak part one, and it was such a leak that you have to imagine if they got all this, they could have, who knows what they could have gotten.

108
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:31,180
Speaker 1: But maybe Twitch was using, were they using GitHub?

109
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,082
Speaker 1: They're Amazon.

110
00:08:32,102 --> 00:08:34,669
Speaker 1: They're probably using OZ code, whatever it is.

111
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:43,450
Speaker 1: So the breach could have come on that side of things and then thus not had access to anything else.

112
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:48,604
Speaker 1: The only outlier is that payment data, why would that be in Git?

113
00:08:48,664 --> 00:08:50,550
Speaker 1: if the Git was the compromised part only?

114
00:08:50,981 --> 00:08:51,190
Speaker 1: Yeah.

115
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,681
Speaker 1: That would be in a database somewhere.

116
00:08:52,761 --> 00:08:53,869
Speaker 1: Why was it in its own database?

117
00:08:54,191 --> 00:08:58,542
Speaker 1: Maybe it was in some sort of payment processor that got compromised or something.

118
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:00,187
Speaker 1: Who knows?

119
00:09:00,247 --> 00:09:01,170
Speaker 1: Something strange is there.

120
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:08,189
Speaker 0: I guess what I would say is that I would be more surprised if this is the extent of the leak than I would be if a part two comes out.

121
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:09,070
Speaker 1: Right.

122
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:15,977
Speaker 1: But there's no reason not to just go change your password, reset your stream keys.

123
00:09:16,437 --> 00:09:17,318
Speaker 1: It's free to do.

124
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,379
Speaker 1: Couldn't hurt.

125
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,346
Speaker 0: If you're not-- Worst case, it's a waste of time.

126
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:26,560
Speaker 0: But best case, it might protect you possibly from other things that may be coming along.

127
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,460
Speaker 1: Make sure you have 2FA enabled on there, which you should do for all your accounts everywhere anyway.

128
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:59,840
Speaker 1: But one thing we did discuss today, which I just is really true, is that a Twitch account, unless you are A, streaming, obviously you need an account, B, subscribing, which you're going to need an account, you really want to chat on Twitch, or you really want to use the feature where you follow people and get notified when they go live, which can be useful for people who rarely go live.

129
00:10:01,241 --> 00:10:10,900
Speaker 1: So unless you want to use one of those four things or combination thereof, even if you watch a lot of Twitch, there's no reason to actually have a Twitch account.

130
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:22,080
Speaker 0: I mean, I will admit, like I tweeted this too, like full disclosure, rather than like deal with this, I just, I reset my, I went, I logged into my Twitch account and I just deleted it because I don't actually use it that often.

131
00:10:22,661 --> 00:10:27,975
Speaker 1: If you don't use any of those four features, even if you use Twitch a lot, you don't need an account.

132
00:10:28,015 --> 00:10:29,660
Speaker 1: An account doesn't get you much, right?

133
00:10:30,321 --> 00:10:45,360
Speaker 1: And most of that, that's just, which is why they should be ego, you know, back to the argument from last week, they should go even harder on making it hard to get an account because people don't even really need an account unless you're doing those things.

134
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,612
Speaker 1: And most of the people who want to make accounts are bots.

135
00:10:48,713 --> 00:10:50,420
Speaker 1: So therefore the barrier should be higher.

136
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,468
Speaker 0: When I saw the breach, I went like, Oh, maybe I should change my password.

137
00:10:53,508 --> 00:10:57,480
Speaker 0: And I wasn't even logged into Twitch on any of my browsers at the time.

138
00:10:57,801 --> 00:11:01,259
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, Twitch will log you out, I think after a certain number of days, no matter what you do.

139
00:11:02,003 --> 00:11:03,519
Speaker 0: But that means I had not like done anything.

140
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,860
Speaker 1: Their expired time seems to be shorter than some others.

141
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,421
Speaker 0: Yeah.

142
00:11:06,441 --> 00:11:09,920
Speaker 0: Cause YouTube, like Google, like almost never logs me out.

143
00:11:10,782 --> 00:11:11,047
Speaker 1: Yeah.

144
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,720
Speaker 1: Very rarely.

145
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,380
Speaker 0: So on some other news, you got this thing from Katsuka.

146
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:16,561
Speaker 1: Yeah.

147
00:11:16,621 --> 00:11:19,935
Speaker 1: Thank you to the listener for posting this on our discord right before the show.

148
00:11:19,975 --> 00:11:21,080
Speaker 1: Cause I couldn't find the news.

149
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:33,100
Speaker 1: So the Onkama studio, the French animation studio, who made an animation such as Dofus and Wakfu, which I've heard of.

150
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:33,840
Speaker 1: Yeah.

151
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:42,080
Speaker 1: Wakfu was a big deal when it came out in some areas, but I haven't heard of it, you know, I've heard of it, but I haven't heard from it in a long time.

152
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,225
Speaker 0: I think we even talked about it on a gig nights.

153
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:46,900
Speaker 0: I watched a bunch of it and I kind of got bored with it and I didn't continue with it.

154
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:53,720
Speaker 1: I wasn't into it, but it was definitely unique at the time and it had an impact like on, you know, animation as a, as a whole.

155
00:11:53,941 --> 00:11:57,360
Speaker 0: It definitely got a critical mass of true fans globally.

156
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,302
Speaker 1: Yeah.

157
00:11:59,322 --> 00:12:07,760
Speaker 1: But anyway, the people who made that are making a full length animated motion film, which is like we always say on geek nights.

158
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:18,880
Speaker 1: There are not that despite the proliferation of, you know, everyone around the world making all kinds of content, more music in a day than you could possibly listen to more movies than ever.

159
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,583
Speaker 1: You could watch more books than you could ever read.

160
00:12:21,184 --> 00:12:31,360
Speaker 1: If you limit yourself to full length, animated movies, 90, you know, we're talking 60, 90 minutes plus two D, you know, animated films.

161
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,768
Speaker 1: Even if they're made with computers, there are not many.

162
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:35,791
Speaker 1: Yeah.

163
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:39,420
Speaker 1: The number that come out in a year are like a few hands worth.

164
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:46,420
Speaker 0: And if you remove everything that is a sequel to an existing property that brings that number down even further.

165
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,201
Speaker 1: Right.

166
00:12:47,341 --> 00:12:57,697
Speaker 1: Because even if you're a totally just an indie place, like to, to animate a thing of that length is a, just a tremendous endeavor, you know, even with the most modern technologies.

167
00:12:57,717 --> 00:12:59,680
Speaker 1: or, you know, let's say you have a pile of money.

168
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,161
Speaker 1: Right.

169
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:02,044
Speaker 1: So there just aren't that many of them.

170
00:13:02,504 --> 00:13:12,900
Speaker 1: You could conceivably, I think if someone dedicated themselves to being, you know, to doing this, you could watch every animated movie that is of a certain length.

171
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:13,241
Speaker 1: Right.

172
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:19,620
Speaker 1: 60, 90 minutes plus that has ever been made by humans within within a lifetime of a single human who is healthy.

173
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:26,980
Speaker 0: You could definitely watch every year, every single feature length animated film that comes out in the world.

174
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,681
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably.

175
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:33,147
Speaker 1: Uh, even if you went for like the really unpopular ones, whatever.

176
00:13:33,888 --> 00:13:42,620
Speaker 1: Uh, so yeah, so they're making one and our policy because of the, what we just said is even it, why not watch an original, right?

177
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,104
Speaker 1: It's an original story.

178
00:13:44,164 --> 00:13:49,297
Speaker 0: Also with these character designs and the, and the topic princess dragon, like, yeah, I'm down, I'm game.

179
00:13:49,658 --> 00:13:50,079
Speaker 0: You got me.

180
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,260
Speaker 0: Right.

181
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,603
Speaker 1: It's like we already have dragon Prince.

182
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,645
Speaker 1: Let's go princess dragon.

183
00:13:55,367 --> 00:14:04,280
Speaker 1: But the thing, all I can say about it, cause there's so little information about it right now, other than like a picture and a little trailer that's tiny or whatever.

184
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:16,160
Speaker 1: But the style of the characters reminds me of a princess Kaguya, maybe a little less sketchy parts, but you know what I mean?

185
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:16,741
Speaker 1: Yup.

186
00:14:16,881 --> 00:14:18,524
Speaker 1: If you've seen princess Kaguya, you know what I mean?

187
00:14:18,704 --> 00:14:26,117
Speaker 0: And the dragon's got a little bit of a Western dragon coupled with a guy who look at the background and the foreground of the, of the movie poster.

188
00:14:26,137 --> 00:14:27,680
Speaker 1: We're doing a little judge by the poster here.

189
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:33,906
Speaker 1: Uh, the art style is like, you know, exactly the opposite of that.

190
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:34,486
Speaker 1: Right.

191
00:14:34,526 --> 00:14:40,491
Speaker 1: So it creates this contrast between the characters and the world that really, you know, I think would work well in a movie.

192
00:14:40,912 --> 00:14:50,220
Speaker 1: And that makes me think that, Oh, this movie might be good if they've already, you know, you can see how much thought they've put into this and positive aspects coming out from a still image.

193
00:14:51,262 --> 00:14:57,011
Speaker 1: I have a positive expectation of what this is going to be, whatever it's going to be.

194
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:02,480
Speaker 1: So it's coming out December 15th in French theaters.

195
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:11,358
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

196
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:12,200
Speaker 0: So check this out.

197
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,290
Speaker 0: This video talks about a bunch of dangerous toys that were sold in America.

198
00:15:17,131 --> 00:15:21,856
Speaker 0: Uh, lawn darts are like, that is, that is baby's first dangerous toy that was sold in stores.

199
00:15:21,896 --> 00:15:23,719
Speaker 0: Like we're, we're going to way beyond that.

200
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:33,630
Speaker 0: But the primary dangerous toy in this video from the sixties, it is a real toy is a gasoline powered pogo stick.

201
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:36,293
Speaker 1: That sounds lovely.

202
00:15:36,533 --> 00:15:38,377
Speaker 0: It is terrifying.

203
00:15:38,918 --> 00:15:45,610
Speaker 1: And I mean, the gasoline powered is probably what's terrifying most people, but pogo stick by itself is terrifying and dangerous.

204
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:51,158
Speaker 1: A pogo stick by itself is already a terrifying dangerous toy, especially when it's constructed poorly.

205
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:51,919
Speaker 0: So yup.

206
00:15:51,939 --> 00:15:58,710
Speaker 0: So imagine a pogo stick that is literally powered by gasoline to make you jump higher.

207
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:01,451
Speaker 1: Yeah.

208
00:16:01,471 --> 00:16:02,072
Speaker 1: Let's not do that.

209
00:16:02,412 --> 00:16:02,612
Speaker 0: Yeah.

210
00:16:03,013 --> 00:16:03,854
Speaker 0: Uh, no one, like.

211
00:16:04,074 --> 00:16:14,910
Speaker 0: there's no gore or anything in this video, but I will say that the person who is trying it out and working on it and demonstrating it hurts themselves basically every time they use it in the entire video.

212
00:16:17,251 --> 00:16:22,461
Speaker 1: You know, you could do, I guess you could make some sort of a pneumatic pogo stick.

213
00:16:22,721 --> 00:16:24,404
Speaker 0: It would be the same result.

214
00:16:24,444 --> 00:16:27,330
Speaker 0: It's kind of like powered powered roller skates or roller blades.

215
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:30,066
Speaker 1: But at least you wouldn't have like this motor going on.

216
00:16:30,086 --> 00:16:30,730
Speaker 1: You'd basically...

217
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,472
Speaker 0: No, no, it's not a motor.

218
00:16:31,672 --> 00:16:32,575
Speaker 0: It is gas.

219
00:16:32,695 --> 00:16:38,150
Speaker 0: Every time it comes down, it ignites the cylinder once and shoots you back up in the air.

220
00:16:40,551 --> 00:16:42,090
Speaker 1: Oh, so the pogo stick is the piston.

221
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,637
Speaker 0: Yeah, the pogo stick is the piston.

222
00:16:43,677 --> 00:16:45,810
Speaker 0: You come down, spark plug fires and shoots you in the air.

223
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,730
Speaker 1: But at least there wouldn't be fire involved if you just used a compressed gas.

224
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,357
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, the fire, even with this, the fire doesn't hurt anyone.

225
00:16:51,657 --> 00:16:56,730
Speaker 0: The act of it pushing you back into the air itself is the danger here.

226
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,010
Speaker 1: I mean, even a trampoline is hella dangerous.

227
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:02,865
Speaker 0: I kind of want to go jump on a trampoline again.

228
00:17:02,905 --> 00:17:03,470
Speaker 0: It's been a while.

229
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:07,029
Speaker 1: You should go to a professional trampoline place.

230
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:11,109
Speaker 0: It's way more fun to just have trampoline fights with friends in someone's backyard.

231
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:16,844
Speaker 1: Well, the trampoline places though, they just have a field of trampolines.

232
00:17:17,045 --> 00:17:18,249
Speaker 1: So that sort of, you know...

233
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:18,911
Speaker 0: Yeah, true.

234
00:17:18,932 --> 00:17:24,369
Speaker 0: You don't have the situation of just falling off the trampoline, which is way scarier than a lot of people realize.

235
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,854
Speaker 1: Well, scary is falling between the trampolines.

236
00:17:29,078 --> 00:17:36,530
Speaker 1: Anyway, so thing of the day, this isn't animation related in any way, but this is dude and he runs a campground.

237
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,894
Speaker 1: People come and camp there.

238
00:17:37,934 --> 00:17:39,780
Speaker 1: They rent little campsites and then they leave.

239
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,150
Speaker 1: It's sort of like a hotel, only way less amenities.

240
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:47,374
Speaker 1: So this campground has been open for a long time.

241
00:17:47,714 --> 00:17:48,976
Speaker 1: It's still open until today.

242
00:17:48,996 --> 00:17:59,490
Speaker 1: And in the 80s, 1985, according to this video, he decided to, you know, use a computer to manage the reservation system at the campground.

243
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:04,610
Speaker 1: But in 1985, you couldn't exactly buy a campground reservation software.

244
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was not campground management as a service.

245
00:18:09,592 --> 00:18:10,714
Speaker 1: I don't even know if there is today.

246
00:18:10,734 --> 00:18:13,419
Speaker 1: You'd probably use something more generic, right, to do that.

247
00:18:14,681 --> 00:18:20,291
Speaker 1: But anyway, so what this person did is they got themselves a computer in 1985.

248
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:21,354
Speaker 1: What computer could you get?

249
00:18:21,394 --> 00:18:23,981
Speaker 1: that wasn't very, that wasn't ridiculously expensive?

250
00:18:24,382 --> 00:18:27,290
Speaker 1: They got an Atari ST, a perfectly fine computer.

251
00:18:27,991 --> 00:18:36,050
Speaker 1: And by themselves, they wrote the software to manage the campground reservation system, which is not that complicated a thing.

252
00:18:36,453 --> 00:18:37,681
Speaker 1: Atari ST could handle it.

253
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:38,990
Speaker 1: It would just wouldn't be that fancy.

254
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:40,493
Speaker 0: It's pretty fancy.

255
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:43,843
Speaker 0: Like it shows a map of the campground and like the campsites.

256
00:18:43,943 --> 00:18:46,370
Speaker 0: Like it's more fancy than you might expect when you watch this video.

257
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:48,091
Speaker 1: Yeah.

258
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:51,517
Speaker 1: But that software doesn't need any internet.

259
00:18:51,837 --> 00:18:53,019
Speaker 1: It didn't need any updates.

260
00:18:54,161 --> 00:18:56,064
Speaker 1: The computer, why would it break?

261
00:18:58,408 --> 00:18:59,530
Speaker 1: It still works today.

262
00:18:59,991 --> 00:19:10,090
Speaker 1: The only upgrade that was made is because, you know, disk drives, uh, I've moving parts and such, they had to replace, you know, the disk drives with something that uses USB sticks, right?

263
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,092
Speaker 1: Some sort of interface.

264
00:19:11,412 --> 00:19:20,810
Speaker 1: Like I have those same similar thing on my Apple computers where I fool the Apple computers into thinking that a micro SD card is actually an old hard drive or an old floppy drive.

265
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:21,311
Speaker 1: Same trick.

266
00:19:22,032 --> 00:19:24,015
Speaker 1: Um, but other than that, it still works.

267
00:19:24,055 --> 00:19:25,097
Speaker 1: He's still using it today.

268
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:31,167
Speaker 1: Why upgrade, you know, um, actually that's in a conversation.

269
00:19:31,187 --> 00:19:32,830
Speaker 1: that's, you know, going on in the tech space.

270
00:19:33,711 --> 00:19:38,790
Speaker 1: Uh, even though it's not a Monday show, we won't go into the discussion, but you know, with chip shortages and such, right?

271
00:19:39,451 --> 00:19:51,170
Speaker 1: It's like if an old slow as chip can do a thing, why use a crazy fancy one, but factories only make new fancy ones, you know, and reuse environment.

272
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:58,101
Speaker 1: So many concerns going into this topic, but this is a actually a good, you know, is this a good environmental move?

273
00:19:58,422 --> 00:19:58,722
Speaker 1: Yes.

274
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:03,610
Speaker 1: Cause he didn't have to buy a new computer, use new Silicon, reduce, reuse, recycle.

275
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,114
Speaker 0: This is reduced and reuse at the same time.

276
00:20:06,755 --> 00:20:11,844
Speaker 1: You have to consider how much power this old as computers using probably more than an iPhone is.

277
00:20:11,964 --> 00:20:15,390
Speaker 1: and an iPhone is many, many, many times more powerful.

278
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:19,376
Speaker 1: So there's a lot going on here, but really interesting video.

279
00:20:19,576 --> 00:20:20,138
Speaker 0: Well, it's funny cause.

280
00:20:20,158 --> 00:20:25,790
Speaker 0: when I worked at IBM, I guess a statute of limitations or NDAs or whatever up, but when I was there, this was a long time ago.

281
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:34,360
Speaker 0: Uh, one of the systems I had to manage was the core DNS for basically the entire fab, like the factory, like critical DNS.

282
00:20:34,961 --> 00:20:42,070
Speaker 0: And it was running on this ancient computer that hadn't been rebooted in years that was running OS2 warp connected to our token ring network.

283
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:50,524
Speaker 0: And, uh, we just all agreed to not try to move it, to not try to shut it down, to not try to upgrade it because it was working fine.

284
00:20:51,566 --> 00:20:53,970
Speaker 0: I presume it's still there to this day.

285
00:20:54,471 --> 00:20:59,850
Speaker 1: But if it's not online and it works, you're good.

286
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:04,737
Speaker 0: So the other day I bumped into, we were cleaning up the apartment that we'll get into the Evangelion review.

287
00:21:05,338 --> 00:21:11,990
Speaker 0: I, uh, I found a set of disks that was actually a parting gift when I did finally quit IBM and move on to other things.

288
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,290
Speaker 1: I thought there was the plaque with the token ring cards.

289
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,051
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I have that.

290
00:21:16,071 --> 00:21:17,773
Speaker 0: That's actually on my desk at work today.

291
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,635
Speaker 0: But I love that plaque.

292
00:21:20,336 --> 00:21:31,610
Speaker 0: But because I, my first big IT project in my career, like the biggest thing I ever did first was helping IBM migrate off of token ring and onto Ethernet.

293
00:21:32,211 --> 00:21:35,397
Speaker 0: And if you think that makes me really old, actually it doesn't.

294
00:21:35,697 --> 00:21:38,002
Speaker 0: This was just a really old archaic network.

295
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:40,346
Speaker 0: But also it makes me really old.

296
00:21:40,687 --> 00:21:41,849
Speaker 0: Two things are happening there.

297
00:21:43,290 --> 00:22:00,430
Speaker 0: But, uh, so the parting gift when I left, because I really like the people I worked with, they gave me CDs that were the last official release of OS2 warp, the operating system, long after it stopped being released to the public.

298
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,948
Speaker 1: You can just download it.

299
00:22:02,712 --> 00:22:04,301
Speaker 0: This was never released to the public.

300
00:22:04,341 --> 00:22:05,830
Speaker 0: I don't know if this is available anywhere.

301
00:22:06,711 --> 00:22:08,469
Speaker 1: Oh, let's get it up on oldversion.com.

302
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:09,952
Speaker 0: Yeah, I found these disks.

303
00:22:10,052 --> 00:22:11,094
Speaker 0: So this weekend.

304
00:22:11,114 --> 00:22:12,175
Speaker 1: Archive.org, let's go.

305
00:22:12,215 --> 00:22:14,859
Speaker 0: This weekend, I'm going to rip these disks to ISOs.

306
00:22:14,899 --> 00:22:18,063
Speaker 0: I'm going to figure out if this is anywhere and see what I can do with these disks.

307
00:22:18,123 --> 00:22:18,885
Speaker 0: So stay tuned.

308
00:22:18,965 --> 00:22:22,770
Speaker 1: Archive.org and oldversion.com are probably your best bets.

309
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:23,432
Speaker 1: Exactly.

310
00:22:23,612 --> 00:22:26,683
Speaker 0: So that's that's an exciting project I'm going to do this weekend.

311
00:22:27,004 --> 00:22:28,750
Speaker 0: I hope these CDRs are still readable.

312
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,417
Speaker 1: That's oldversion.com.

313
00:22:31,457 --> 00:22:32,020
Speaker 1: Still love them.

314
00:22:32,061 --> 00:22:32,624
Speaker 1: Take a look.

315
00:22:32,664 --> 00:22:33,228
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

316
00:22:33,288 --> 00:22:33,530
Speaker 1: Anyway.

317
00:22:34,191 --> 00:22:44,390
Speaker 0: In the meta moment, the geek dies book, which we are steamrolling through now, the tale of Genji as he sleeps and fucks his way through life, causing minor problems along the way.

318
00:22:47,031 --> 00:22:51,126
Speaker 0: Otherwise, we're not going to any conventions anytime soon for all the reasons you can imagine.

319
00:22:51,387 --> 00:22:51,929
Speaker 0: Our most recent...

320
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,924
Speaker 1: No, PAX Unplugged is happening, though.

321
00:22:53,964 --> 00:22:54,570
Speaker 1: We won't be there.

322
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,112
Speaker 1: Yep.

323
00:22:56,492 --> 00:23:01,719
Speaker 0: Atari Game Design, the last panel we did for a convention, which was for PAX East Online, is just on YouTube.

324
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,581
Speaker 0: You can just watch it.

325
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:04,043
Speaker 0: Follow us on the Internet.

326
00:23:04,103 --> 00:23:05,264
Speaker 0: We keep doing stuff.

327
00:23:05,645 --> 00:23:06,546
Speaker 0: We stream stuff.

328
00:23:06,606 --> 00:23:07,447
Speaker 0: We're making stuff.

329
00:23:07,467 --> 00:23:08,328
Speaker 0: We keep making stuff.

330
00:23:08,348 --> 00:23:09,650
Speaker 0: This podcast is on the Internet.

331
00:23:10,471 --> 00:23:16,345
Speaker 0: And I feel like we should jump right into the review because we already have too much to say for one episode.

332
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:18,450
Speaker 0: And I haven't even seen the last of these movies.

333
00:23:19,011 --> 00:23:19,452
Speaker 1: That's right.

334
00:23:19,512 --> 00:23:22,638
Speaker 1: So, RIM did not watch all four of these movies.

335
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:25,163
Speaker 1: I watched... This is my strategy.

336
00:23:25,263 --> 00:23:27,187
Speaker 1: I remember we were at Otacon.

337
00:23:27,207 --> 00:23:28,469
Speaker 1: The last Otacon we went to was '09.

338
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:29,450
Speaker 0: Yeah.

339
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,694
Speaker 1: So, we were at an Otacon.

340
00:23:31,734 --> 00:23:33,299
Speaker 1: I forget if it was '08 or '09.

341
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:34,081
Speaker 1: Someone can look it up.

342
00:23:34,802 --> 00:23:37,650
Speaker 1: And it was definitely one of the last two that we were at, for sure.

343
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:42,390
Speaker 1: And they were showing the first Evangelion rebuild movie.

344
00:23:42,991 --> 00:23:45,610
Speaker 0: Evangelion 1.0, you are not alone.

345
00:23:46,351 --> 00:23:46,591
Speaker 1: Right.

346
00:23:46,631 --> 00:23:48,375
Speaker 1: So, they were showing it there, like U.S.

347
00:23:48,415 --> 00:23:48,916
Speaker 1: Premiere.

348
00:23:49,437 --> 00:23:52,022
Speaker 1: And I was like, at that moment, I said, "You know what?

349
00:23:52,042 --> 00:23:53,906
Speaker 1: There's going to be four of these things.

350
00:23:54,468 --> 00:23:55,329
Speaker 1: I've already seen the

351
00:23:55,349 --> 00:23:55,570
Speaker 1: show.".

352
00:23:55,771 --> 00:23:56,814
Speaker 1: And I said, "At that moment...".

353
00:23:56,874 --> 00:23:57,938
Speaker 1: I said, "Nah.

354
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:01,429
Speaker 1: I'll wait until all four out and watch them all in one

355
00:24:01,469 --> 00:24:01,610
Speaker 1: go.".

356
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:01,970
Speaker 1: Yep.

357
00:24:02,131 --> 00:24:03,173
Speaker 0: I had two thoughts there.

358
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,275
Speaker 0: My first thought was that.

359
00:24:04,336 --> 00:24:07,162
Speaker 0: And my second thought was, "I've already seen Evangelion.

360
00:24:07,202 --> 00:24:10,689
Speaker 0: It's just going to be super fancy, like reanimated movies of the same

361
00:24:10,729 --> 00:24:10,930
Speaker 0: thing.".

362
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:14,636
Speaker 1: I was not sure what I was thinking, because I peeked in.

363
00:24:14,676 --> 00:24:15,999
Speaker 1: I think I even peeked in the door.

364
00:24:16,099 --> 00:24:18,222
Speaker 1: And I saw scenes that I had seen already.

365
00:24:18,303 --> 00:24:22,269
Speaker 1: And I was like, "Oh, this is just going to be like a compilation, sort of HD remake

366
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:22,610
Speaker 1: deal.".

367
00:24:22,731 --> 00:24:23,278
Speaker 0: That's what I thought.

368
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:23,784
Speaker 0: And you know what?

369
00:24:23,824 --> 00:24:24,270
Speaker 0: That's fair.

370
00:24:24,571 --> 00:24:25,750
Speaker 1: That's what I thought at the time.

371
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:30,589
Speaker 0: Because other than the last 30 seconds of that fucking movie, that is just what it is.

372
00:24:31,371 --> 00:24:39,568
Speaker 1: Well, I learned not long after that that it wasn't just an HD remake, because once the second one came out, right?

373
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:41,892
Speaker 0: Yep.

374
00:24:41,992 --> 00:24:44,799
Speaker 0: So, that was 2007 in Japan that that movie came out.

375
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:48,267
Speaker 0: So, Scott says in 2007, "I will wait until this is

376
00:24:48,307 --> 00:24:48,528
Speaker 0: done.".

377
00:24:48,548 --> 00:24:49,330
Speaker 0: A wise move.

378
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:52,390
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know if 2007 was when they showed it in the US, though.

379
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:56,310
Speaker 0: Well, so I'm going to go by the Japanese release dates, because it wasn't really...

380
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, we don't know what date they showed it.

381
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:02,830
Speaker 0: It was not released officially in North America until 2009.

382
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,084
Speaker 0: But...

383
00:25:03,271 --> 00:25:04,602
Speaker 1: It must have been '09.

384
00:25:04,622 --> 00:25:05,470
Speaker 1: then it was at Otakon.

385
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,569
Speaker 0: But '08 was the last Otakon we went to.

386
00:25:08,271 --> 00:25:09,086
Speaker 1: No, we went to Otakon '09.

387
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:09,976
Speaker 1: Did we?

388
00:25:09,996 --> 00:25:10,648
Speaker 0: I don't think we did.

389
00:25:11,271 --> 00:25:12,470
Speaker 1: I think '09 was the last one.

390
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:15,010
Speaker 0: '09 is the one where they kicked us off the staff because we refused to come.

391
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,187
Speaker 1: I think I have a badge for '09.

392
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,860
Speaker 0: I think '08 was the last one.

393
00:25:17,961 --> 00:25:18,264
Speaker 0: Anyway...

394
00:25:18,931 --> 00:25:19,530
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

395
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:20,486
Speaker 1: I'll go by the Japanese years.

396
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:23,435
Speaker 0: So, 2007.

397
00:25:23,435 --> 00:25:26,730
Speaker 0: We wisely agreed to wait until all four movies come out, then watch them all.

398
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,217
Speaker 0: 2009.

399
00:25:28,217 --> 00:25:29,286
Speaker 0: The second movie comes out.

400
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,990
Speaker 0: Way off the rails from the first movie, but we just keep waiting.

401
00:25:34,851 --> 00:25:48,368
Speaker 1: The reason I knew when things had gone off the rails is because I had started seeing pictures of this Ava pilot who was not in the show, not in any... It's like, "Oh, clearly they've changed a lot if there's a whole new freaking character in

402
00:25:48,408 --> 00:25:48,649
Speaker 1: there.".

403
00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:49,950
Speaker 1: 2012.

404
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,458
Speaker 1: The third movie comes out.

405
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,256
Speaker 0: So, 2012.

406
00:25:55,256 --> 00:25:57,930
Speaker 0: Nearly a decade ago, the third movie came out.

407
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:02,132
Speaker 0: And the fourth movie came out this year in 2021.

408
00:26:02,132 --> 00:26:02,676
Speaker 1: Now, hold up.

409
00:26:02,736 --> 00:26:04,408
Speaker 1: There's an extra layer to this.

410
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:10,490
Speaker 1: Not only were there four movies, but each movie sort of had two releases.

411
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:19,267
Speaker 1: So, what they did is they released the movie quickly to the theater, and then they updated them a bit to fix them up.

412
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:25,230
Speaker 1: Sort of like how a lot of times there'll be a TV anime, and then for the DVD release, they'll fix a lot of stuff.

413
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:30,910
Speaker 0: Yep, they fixed a bunch of stuff, and they added a total of seven minutes to the runtime.

414
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:32,138
Speaker 1: Right, so...

415
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:33,389
Speaker 0: Across all four movies.

416
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:41,570
Speaker 1: Right, so each of the four movies individually had two versions, and a slight, tiny upgrade.

417
00:26:43,953 --> 00:26:47,449
Speaker 1: It gets confusing because the names of the movies have version numbers in them.

418
00:26:48,151 --> 00:26:55,811
Speaker 1: But if you consider them all to just be 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, they released 1.1, 2.1, 3.0, and 4.1.

419
00:26:55,811 --> 00:26:57,859
Speaker 1: So, you don't need to watch those .0 ones.

420
00:26:57,899 --> 00:27:00,810
Speaker 1: You only need to watch the beefed up ones.

421
00:27:01,131 --> 00:27:07,250
Speaker 1: I don't even know what the differences are because I've never watched those unpolished ones.

422
00:27:07,391 --> 00:27:08,409
Speaker 1: I've only watched the four.

423
00:27:08,951 --> 00:27:14,690
Speaker 1: And if you go on Amazon Prime, which is where you can watch this in the United States for free if you have Prime, so not free.

424
00:27:15,911 --> 00:27:18,500
Speaker 1: You will just see those upgraded ones.

425
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,925
Speaker 1: You will not see those original ones.

426
00:27:19,945 --> 00:27:20,487
Speaker 1: They don't exist.

427
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,865
Speaker 1: They're like Star Wars, not Special Edition.

428
00:27:24,047 --> 00:27:24,550
Speaker 1: They're just gone.

429
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,870
Speaker 0: Now, what I will say is we're going to review these like a normal anime review.

430
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,890
Speaker 0: We're not going to spoil stuff other than I hinted at it at the beginning.

431
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:38,330
Speaker 0: We're going to spoil broad themes of Evangelion, obviously, like what the show's about and stuff.

432
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:42,507
Speaker 1: We might spoil the original TV show from how many years ago?

433
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:42,648
Speaker 1: The 90s?

434
00:27:43,491 --> 00:27:43,793
Speaker 1: Yup.

435
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:47,148
Speaker 0: But we're not going to spoil anything materially.

436
00:27:47,188 --> 00:27:47,530
Speaker 0: Don't worry.

437
00:27:48,571 --> 00:27:56,890
Speaker 0: Like we used to do in ancient times, we're going to do a separate, completely spoiler-filled Final Thoughts episode because I've only seen three.

438
00:27:57,451 --> 00:28:00,506
Speaker 0: I have not seen the end of this yet.

439
00:28:00,727 --> 00:28:01,250
Speaker 0: Scott has.

440
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:04,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know why you're even qualified to have this show if you haven't seen the fourth one.

441
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:05,054
Speaker 1: I saw them all.

442
00:28:05,094 --> 00:28:07,269
Speaker 1: I watched as soon as they came out.

443
00:28:07,731 --> 00:28:12,230
Speaker 1: That weekend, I watched the first two on Saturday and the second two on Sunday, and I might do it again.

444
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:14,820
Speaker 0: Well, I'm going to watch them all again.

445
00:28:14,861 --> 00:28:15,222
Speaker 0: Good lord.

446
00:28:15,302 --> 00:28:17,090
Speaker 0: Actually, I went back and watched scenes.

447
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:18,450
Speaker 1: I might not watch the first one again.

448
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:24,490
Speaker 0: I don't need to watch the first one again, but I did go back and watch scenes from the original Evangelion to compare to the first movie.

449
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:28,685
Speaker 0: And, uh, yeah, I have a lot to say.

450
00:28:28,705 --> 00:28:31,081
Speaker 1: I don't know how- Alright, well, let's start there.

451
00:28:31,101 --> 00:28:32,190
Speaker 1: Let's start with the first movie.

452
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:37,083
Speaker 1: So the first movie is literally just the TV series.

453
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:39,808
Speaker 1: Evangelion episodes one through- Yup.

454
00:28:40,072 --> 00:28:41,059
Speaker 1: I forget which one.

455
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,650
Speaker 1: The sniper rifle one, I want to say?

456
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,216
Speaker 0: Yeah, it goes up to about the sniper rifle.

457
00:28:44,296 --> 00:28:46,546
Speaker 0: Actually, no, it doesn't even quite get to the sniper rifle one.

458
00:28:46,566 --> 00:28:47,390
Speaker 0: It's like right there.

459
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:50,530
Speaker 1: No, I think the sniper rifle is included in the first movie.

460
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,178
Speaker 0: Yes, you're right.

461
00:28:51,199 --> 00:28:51,443
Speaker 0: You're right.

462
00:28:51,464 --> 00:28:51,790
Speaker 0: Never mind.

463
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:52,650
Speaker 1: Yes.

464
00:28:52,730 --> 00:29:00,930
Speaker 1: So if you take just Evangelion, the TV show, from episode one up through whatever episode the sniper rifle is, you know, the famous one, right?

465
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,481
Speaker 1: The whatever it's called, Plasma Cannon.

466
00:29:02,501 --> 00:29:03,550
Speaker 1: I forget what they called it, right?

467
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:04,288
Speaker 0: Positron Cannon.

468
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:05,613
Speaker 1: That's the one.

469
00:29:05,694 --> 00:29:07,790
Speaker 1: The Positron Cannon episode, the famous episode.

470
00:29:08,712 --> 00:29:14,181
Speaker 1: And you edit it down, you know, to only- because think about it, those episodes are what?

471
00:29:14,181 --> 00:29:16,806
Speaker 1: 20 to 30 minutes each times.

472
00:29:17,948 --> 00:29:19,210
Speaker 1: maybe five, six, seven?

473
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:22,590
Speaker 1: So your- it gets edited down just to the important scenes.

474
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:23,553
Speaker 0: Oh, I found a listing.

475
00:29:23,633 --> 00:29:29,410
Speaker 0: It covers up until about like episode six of the original show.

476
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:29,931
Speaker 1: Episode six.

477
00:29:29,951 --> 00:29:35,086
Speaker 1: Okay, so about six times 25 would be 150.

478
00:29:35,086 --> 00:29:36,470
Speaker 1: How many minutes long is the movie?

479
00:29:37,258 --> 00:29:38,450
Speaker 0: A hundred and one minutes.

480
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,770
Speaker 1: So you're cutting out 40 minutes basically.

481
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:58,349
Speaker 0: And I will say this, my only complaint about this entire rebuild is, and it's not even really an important complaint, is that the first movie, up until the very end, loses the atmosphere of the original show in that- Not enough cicada scenes.

482
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:09,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, because it's so condensed, it's almost just like a greatest hits of like, it is shot for shot, all the really iconic scenes from those first six episodes, beautifully animated.

483
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:18,650
Speaker 0: But it like skips all the like side character building and all the atmosphere and it feels just rushed and fast.

484
00:30:19,071 --> 00:30:27,290
Speaker 0: But at the same time, I don't have a real complaint about that because what it really did for me is just remind me of, oh yeah, that's what happened to Neva.

485
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:30,715
Speaker 1: I think that was the purpose of it.

486
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:33,839
Speaker 1: It's not, you know, a replacement for the TV show.

487
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:41,490
Speaker 1: It's a, all right, we're making these other three movies and we're expecting you not to go and watch the TV show again.

488
00:30:42,031 --> 00:30:48,461
Speaker 1: But you've seen the TV show before, so watch this first movie and we're just going to refresh you.

489
00:30:48,942 --> 00:30:53,690
Speaker 1: so you're where you need to be to watch the next three rebuild movies.

490
00:30:54,431 --> 00:30:58,277
Speaker 1: Also, while we're here, right, it's like some nostalgia.

491
00:30:58,377 --> 00:31:02,043
Speaker 1: You're seeing all these iconic famous scenes that we've kept in.

492
00:31:02,223 --> 00:31:05,949
Speaker 1: We've edited out cicada noise scenes and things of that nature, right?

493
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:13,164
Speaker 1: And we, you know, it's really this plot wise, you're getting everything.

494
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:15,250
Speaker 1: There's almost no changes whatsoever.

495
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:15,771
Speaker 1: You're kind

496
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:33,890
Speaker 0: of getting more earlier because the difference, the main differences, other than the big difference we'll talk about at the end, are that it focuses more, like it shows you more viscera and blood details of the angels, which is notable for the rest of the movies, the blood.

497
00:31:35,251 --> 00:31:45,869
Speaker 0: Two, it pretty explicitly tells you Sele's deal and a lot of what's going on way earlier than that even comes up in the actual original show.

498
00:31:47,931 --> 00:31:59,490
Speaker 0: Like, it's like, oh yeah, human instrumentality, Sele, like, it just kind of tells you a lot of this stuff really explicitly way earlier and it completely skips anything related to the computers.

499
00:32:00,191 --> 00:32:05,219
Speaker 1: But otherwise, it's pretty much mentioned the computers occasionally throughout the movies.

500
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:11,510
Speaker 1: But if you haven't seen the TV, you might not know what they're talking about when they talk about the computers.

501
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,810
Speaker 1: But yeah, the whole computer thing just edited out entirely.

502
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:26,970
Speaker 0: And I guess the one thing I'll say as a review first is that I would not recommend watching these movies without watching the original show first, partly because the original show is brilliant and a very important piece of animation.

503
00:32:27,473 --> 00:32:28,500
Speaker 0: It is worth watching.

504
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,647
Speaker 0: I'm going to link to...

505
00:32:30,191 --> 00:32:31,069
Speaker 1: Even if you don't like it.

506
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:38,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, like, if you love Evangelion, if you hate Evangelion, there's a reason everyone keeps talking about Evangelion and we're doing this show right now.

507
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:42,750
Speaker 0: The show is important, it is worth watching, and whatever you take away from it, you're going to take away from it.

508
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:53,830
Speaker 0: And if you watch this first movie, it really removes a lot of the things that set you in the mood for the rest of Evangelion.

509
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,069
Speaker 0: You'll miss out on a lot of why that show was good.

510
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:03,226
Speaker 1: But if you are someone who's just not ever going to watch the TV show, it's like, I guess this can sort of get you up to speed.

511
00:33:03,447 --> 00:33:04,630
Speaker 1: It's going to get the job done.

512
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:16,250
Speaker 0: Also, after the first movie, the rest of the movies, the rebuilds, they're faster in terms of plot that happens, but they also have all the atmosphere and everything back.

513
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:20,270
Speaker 0: The pacing is more like Evangelion after that first movie.

514
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:21,627
Speaker 0: A little bit.

515
00:33:22,052 --> 00:33:25,430
Speaker 0: We'll get to that, especially in the second movie and the third movie and the vibe.

516
00:33:27,135 --> 00:33:31,350
Speaker 0: But then, at the very end of this movie, I'm watching it, not knowing a lot about the rebuilds.

517
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:37,970
Speaker 1: You're watching the first movie and literally everything that happens is like, you know what's going to happen because you've seen the TV show, it's just the TV show.

518
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:42,130
Speaker 0: I was literally just there like, alright, now I'm going to see this scene, now I'm going to see this scene.

519
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:45,530
Speaker 0: He's going to lay there in the bed with his hand over his eye, listening to that tape.

520
00:33:45,831 --> 00:33:52,970
Speaker 1: There's one scene that is a scene from the TV show, but it happens way later in the TV show.

521
00:33:53,832 --> 00:34:00,450
Speaker 1: They put it in the middle of this movie, so it's a slight time change in terms of when that event happens.

522
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:03,810
Speaker 0: And that event is very important to the show.

523
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:10,570
Speaker 1: It's an important event, but other than that, everything else is pretty much lockstep.

524
00:34:11,011 --> 00:34:17,550
Speaker 1: You know, we're talking frame by frame, the only difference being the aspect ratio and the resolution and whatnot, right, because it's HD.

525
00:34:17,951 --> 00:34:18,895
Speaker 0: And all the blood stuff.

526
00:34:19,337 --> 00:34:22,290
Speaker 0: Until the very end of this movie.

527
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:26,909
Speaker 1: We're talking like seconds, like the final seconds of the first movie.

528
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:34,050
Speaker 0: Like suddenly, it is just like, oh, by the way, everything after this moment is complete batshit.

529
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:36,181
Speaker 0: This isn't the Evangelion you know at all.

530
00:34:36,443 --> 00:34:37,550
Speaker 0: Here's a bunch of new characters.

531
00:34:37,891 --> 00:34:46,330
Speaker 0: Here's a character who you should not know about, literally on the moon, looking down at Earth.

532
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:47,909
Speaker 0: And he says some stuff.

533
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,129
Speaker 1: And is surrounded by some stuff.

534
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:56,190
Speaker 0: Yup, some stuff that if you've seen Evangelion and you haven't seen these movies, it is hard.

535
00:34:57,214 --> 00:34:59,089
Speaker 0: All you can react to that is, oh my God.

536
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:05,930
Speaker 0: And if we had watched this movie when it first came out, we wouldn't have been able to respond to that for years.

537
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:09,390
Speaker 1: Right, it's like what the hell was going on there, right?

538
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:14,830
Speaker 1: That final few seconds scene in no way fits, right?

539
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,970
Speaker 1: It's like everything they've showed you is something you've seen before.

540
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:25,690
Speaker 1: And then they show you something that doesn't fit at all with any of the end of Evangelion movies, TV shows, like anything, right?

541
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:29,390
Speaker 0: Like we're talking, I don't think this will spoil anything material.

542
00:35:30,791 --> 00:35:39,910
Speaker 0: You see like a bunch of Spears of Longinus and a character on the moon and a bunch of other Avas and all this ridiculous nonsense that you cannot parse.

543
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:45,050
Speaker 1: Right, it would be like if you're watching, you know, just to stick with Anno's faves, right?

544
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:47,450
Speaker 1: Let's say you're watching like a Godzilla movie, right?

545
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:52,590
Speaker 1: And it's like, okay, Godzilla's smashing the Tokyo, the humans are finding a way to stop him, right?

546
00:35:52,931 --> 00:35:53,589
Speaker 1: Okay, cool.

547
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:57,950
Speaker 1: And then at the end, you know, it's like, you know, the movie's over, right?

548
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:59,689
Speaker 1: And you're like, okay, that was a Godzilla movie.

549
00:36:00,111 --> 00:36:05,990
Speaker 1: And then they show you like the bottom of the ocean where 10 Godzillas live in a house or something.

550
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:06,485
Speaker 1: It's like, what?

551
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:10,829
Speaker 0: And one of those Godzillas is like talking in English and doing something strange.

552
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,308
Speaker 1: It's like, what?

553
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,869
Speaker 1: It doesn't fit in any way with any Godzillas come before.

554
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:21,250
Speaker 0: Or like that Godzilla, like opens a gate and a submarine comes out.

555
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:24,150
Speaker 0: And in that submarine are a bunch of little Godzillas or some nonsense.

556
00:36:26,312 --> 00:36:28,350
Speaker 1: So after that, the second movie.

557
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:51,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, after that, the best way I can describe this is imagine the same characters plus new characters who are mostly the same people, but the events that happen around them are radically different and happen in a different order or two different people or four different reasons.

558
00:36:52,232 --> 00:37:06,788
Speaker 0: Like I'd almost imagine an alternate universe where like radically different things happen, but the characters react to those events the way you would expect those characters from the original show to react had those events happened in the original show.

559
00:37:08,171 --> 00:37:14,850
Speaker 0: And the moral is like, it's the same story, the same core, but with a very different journey.

560
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:16,230
Speaker 1: Right.

561
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:24,770
Speaker 1: So this, I've talked about this before, I think with some other media, the same idea that, you know, let's say you have a story, right?

562
00:37:25,111 --> 00:37:28,890
Speaker 1: And you're telling a story about capitalism bad, right?

563
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:29,850
Speaker 1: So you have a story, right?

564
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:35,630
Speaker 1: And so you can tell that same story with the same message of capitalism bad.

565
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:46,449
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter at the, like at the ending, you could have capitalism kill the good character or at the end, you could have socialism save the good character, right?

566
00:37:47,711 --> 00:37:54,230
Speaker 1: And those are completely different endings, completely different things happen, but you're saying the same thing, right?

567
00:37:54,431 --> 00:37:57,390
Speaker 1: Even with drastically different events in the plot.

568
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:59,889
Speaker 0: Which almost serve to reinforce each other.

569
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:00,932
Speaker 1: Right.

570
00:38:01,032 --> 00:38:08,927
Speaker 1: So here it's like you're Evangelion, same exact message as original Evangelion, mostly like 90% plus, right?

571
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,750
Speaker 1: Hedgehog's dilemma, all that biz, right?

572
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:24,749
Speaker 1: It's saying the same things, even though the events that are unfolding with the same characters, you know, same voice actors in most cases, all cases, I don't even get right.

573
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,217
Speaker 0: They sound right.

574
00:38:26,318 --> 00:38:27,289
Speaker 0: That's all that matters to me.

575
00:38:27,811 --> 00:38:30,419
Speaker 1: Same personality, same director, right?

576
00:38:30,479 --> 00:38:34,150
Speaker 1: Same all this stuff, same designs, mostly same designs.

577
00:38:35,371 --> 00:38:43,570
Speaker 1: Telling the same effective story meaning wise, but the events that unfold are tremendously different.

578
00:38:43,970 --> 00:39:01,490
Speaker 0: So like a non-spoilery example, other than that, the one of the core, like I'll link to the episode where we talked about like what Evangelion was about in depth, but it has the like physical story of the events that happen, but the moral in the message is mostly around the hedgehog's dilemma.

579
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:05,010
Speaker 0: The idea that humans are separate beings.

580
00:39:05,652 --> 00:39:09,770
Speaker 0: We can communicate with each other, but we can't communicate what's in our truest heart perfectly.

581
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:10,532
Speaker 0: Like we can't.

582
00:39:10,653 --> 00:39:14,110
Speaker 0: I cannot convey the truest thoughts I have in my brain to Scott.

583
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:17,110
Speaker 0: Well, I can convey a simulacra of that, but they're not the same.

584
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:25,369
Speaker 0: The closer people get to each other, the more potential they have to hurt each other, but also the more potential they have to help each other.

585
00:39:27,412 --> 00:39:35,370
Speaker 0: And the show just explores this concept almost to the extreme, absurd conclusions that this conversation could have.

586
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:44,980
Speaker 0: So imagine in the first show, you're watching the show and you're thinking, "Fucking Shinji, if you would just talk to someone even once about your feelings, everything would have been

587
00:39:45,021 --> 00:39:45,284
Speaker 0: different.".

588
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:46,815
Speaker 0: So now watch these movies.

589
00:39:47,317 --> 00:39:50,190
Speaker 0: Oh, Shinji talked to someone about his feelings.

590
00:39:50,612 --> 00:39:52,160
Speaker 0: Everything is really different.

591
00:39:52,261 --> 00:39:53,950
Speaker 0: It's the exact same message.

592
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:55,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly right.

593
00:39:55,881 --> 00:39:56,730
Speaker 1: That's exactly right.

594
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:00,310
Speaker 0: Misato, you could have gone into that room and said something instead of saying nothing.

595
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:04,010
Speaker 0: Gendo, you could have praised your fucking son once, maybe.

596
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,324
Speaker 0: And yes, that's true.

597
00:40:06,565 --> 00:40:07,190
Speaker 0: Everything's different.

598
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:14,090
Speaker 0: It validates everything you thought about the original show, and it shows how, yeah, the events are very different, but the message is the same.

599
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:16,234
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could just show.

600
00:40:16,295 --> 00:40:26,910
Speaker 1: it's like, if you do this, if the show is trying to tell you do X, you can send the message of do X either by showing someone not doing X and failing or doing X and succeeding.

601
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:38,230
Speaker 1: So it's a rebuild in that way, and that last time they showed not doing X and failing, and this time they'll show doing X and succeeding, but the message is still, "You should have done X," right?

602
00:40:38,651 --> 00:40:40,784
Speaker 1: Oh, and it's sort of like, "Look, they did X and it worked.

603
00:40:40,824 --> 00:40:41,348
Speaker 1: See, I told

604
00:40:41,368 --> 00:40:41,468
Speaker 1: you.".

605
00:40:43,893 --> 00:40:57,250
Speaker 1: So I think this is really interesting in that, you know, usually when people redo movies or any kind of story in any medium, right, you're usually getting a sequel or a prequel, which this is not.

606
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:59,350
Speaker 1: This is not a sequel or a prequel, right?

607
00:41:00,951 --> 00:41:08,150
Speaker 1: It is not a HD remake where you're just doing the same thing again, only fancier colors, right?

608
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,630
Speaker 1: And it's like a Star Wars special.

609
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:16,750
Speaker 0: It is hard to express how radically different everything is after the first movie.

610
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:17,732
Speaker 1: Right.

611
00:41:17,753 --> 00:41:18,510
Speaker 1: It's a rebuild.

612
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:28,170
Speaker 1: And so in the rebuild, the overall thing that makes it different is that is it good, right?

613
00:41:28,211 --> 00:41:29,710
Speaker 1: Is it better than the original?

614
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:35,690
Speaker 1: It's not like a superhero comics where it's like, "Okay, alternate universe," right?

615
00:41:35,912 --> 00:41:36,941
Speaker 1: It's like, "No, this is

616
00:41:37,001 --> 00:41:37,445
Speaker 1: canon.".

617
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:40,525
Speaker 1: And so the TV show is also canon.

618
00:41:40,786 --> 00:41:41,350
Speaker 1: It's all canon.

619
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:47,670
Speaker 0: In fact, based on at least the first three movies, "canon" with a capital C, and I'll leave it at that.

620
00:41:48,832 --> 00:41:52,870
Speaker 1: Everything that happened in the TV show happened and everything in this happened, even though it's not a sequel.

621
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:58,570
Speaker 1: And that'll only make sense if you've seen it all, which is why it's okay to just say that.

622
00:41:58,732 --> 00:41:59,830
Speaker 1: It's not spoiling anything.

623
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:08,830
Speaker 1: But whether the movies... I actually like the TV show way more than the movies still, even having seen all four of the movies.

624
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:11,490
Speaker 0: But I liked the movies nearly equally.

625
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:21,570
Speaker 1: But what I think is great about the rebuild and why I think maybe someone else will attempt a rebuild of something else at some point.

626
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,348
Speaker 1: I don't know if any... I can't think of anyone who has.

627
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:35,150
Speaker 0: The nearest thing I can think of, but it's such a poor analogy because these tended to be garbage, was there was a number of 90s anime that had an OAV that was very popular.

628
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:42,270
Speaker 0: And then they would make an alternate universe where they tell the same story again as a longer TV show to explore an alternate set of events.

629
00:42:43,072 --> 00:42:44,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's an alternate universe.

630
00:42:46,172 --> 00:42:48,760
Speaker 0: And also, they didn't really have the same messages.

631
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:51,990
Speaker 0: They were mostly just bad and watered down.

632
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:52,920
Speaker 1: You know what's comparable?

633
00:42:52,961 --> 00:42:53,690
Speaker 1: You know what's comparable?

634
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:55,070
Speaker 1: Zelda's comparable.

635
00:42:56,612 --> 00:43:02,290
Speaker 1: Zelda games is like, yeah, there was a book that had some sequence of timelines or whatever in it or something.

636
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:07,249
Speaker 1: But all the Zelda games are mostly separate, taking place in different...

637
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:12,009
Speaker 0: But they explore a very similar story, a very similar universe, a very similar...

638
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:16,950
Speaker 1: Every Zelda game is sort of like Rebuild of Legend of Zelda, in a way.

639
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:17,737
Speaker 1: And the existence...

640
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:26,231
Speaker 0: Even though I like the TV show more than the movies... Zelda 2 is canonically an explicit sequel of Zelda 1.

641
00:43:26,231 --> 00:43:26,526
Speaker 0: But anyway...

642
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:37,210
Speaker 1: The existence of these movies, the fact that they're there, actually, somehow, makes the TV show better.

643
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:37,762
Speaker 0: Yes!

644
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:42,150
Speaker 1: It's like, the TV show is better because the movie's here.

645
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:55,530
Speaker 1: It's the opposite of what nerds complain about, which obviously isn't true, is that, oh, you ruined the thing I like by making a new thing, which can't possibly happen because you could just pretend the new thing isn't there.

646
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:56,534
Speaker 0: It's almost put me into a loop.

647
00:43:56,715 --> 00:44:00,330
Speaker 0: Watching these movies, I really want to go back and watch the entire show again.

648
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:06,030
Speaker 0: But if I watch the entire show again, I feel like I'm going to think, oh, now I want to watch the movies again.

649
00:44:08,231 --> 00:44:16,150
Speaker 1: It's like, if these movies were, say, garbage, completely awful, the TV show would still be as good as it was on its own.

650
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:20,950
Speaker 0: And we could just ignore the movies, like we do for those other Indiana Jones movies.

651
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:26,690
Speaker 1: That original artwork cannot be harmed, but it's not easy to elevate it either.

652
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:46,930
Speaker 1: The movies, even if you don't think they're good, even if you don't like them, or don't like them as much as the TV show, I like them just not as much as the TV show, they somehow have the power to, if you have seen them, the original TV show now means more.

653
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:52,850
Speaker 1: It has become elevated in a way because there was a rebuild that happened later.

654
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:54,435
Speaker 0: And I'd say it's from two angles.

655
00:44:54,595 --> 00:44:59,530
Speaker 0: On one hand, it reinforces the underlying themes of the original show.

656
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:06,450
Speaker 0: So you watch the original show again, and you can compare all these different paths and really internalize the meta message.

657
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:17,670
Speaker 0: But also, the movie explores many of the worldbuilding and science fiction aspects of the show that were footnotes in the show and vice versa.

658
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:20,357
Speaker 0: I'll give an example that's not super spoiler-ly.

659
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:28,201
Speaker 0: In the show, there's a moment where you find out there's a nerve base in the US, and there's an accident there, and it just disappears.

660
00:45:28,622 --> 00:45:29,205
Speaker 0: It blows up.

661
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:30,350
Speaker 0: There's a big disaster.

662
00:45:31,972 --> 00:45:32,717
Speaker 1: It's like a footnote.

663
00:45:32,758 --> 00:45:34,410
Speaker 1: Isn't that in the lava episode, I want to say?

664
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:35,052
Speaker 0: I think so.

665
00:45:35,093 --> 00:45:36,920
Speaker 0: I forget exactly, but I think you're right.

666
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:39,429
Speaker 0: So that just happens, and characters react to it.

667
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:43,619
Speaker 0: But you don't get an episode where they go and investigate it.

668
00:45:43,899 --> 00:45:48,490
Speaker 0: In the movies, that happens, and they go fucking deal with it.

669
00:45:50,251 --> 00:45:56,741
Speaker 1: Yeah, because the original TV show has these hints that early in the TV show, they deliver AV unit 3.

670
00:45:56,741 --> 00:45:57,423
Speaker 1: It's delivered.

671
00:46:02,814 --> 00:46:03,518
Speaker 0: From Europe.

672
00:46:04,302 --> 00:46:05,930
Speaker 0: Well, O2 from Europe.

673
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,041
Speaker 0: And then 3.

674
00:46:08,041 --> 00:46:09,631
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's unit 2.

675
00:46:09,631 --> 00:46:11,050
Speaker 0: It's unit 2, but it's the third one.

676
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:13,936
Speaker 1: But yeah, it gets delivered.

677
00:46:14,258 --> 00:46:17,570
Speaker 1: But they never show you what the hell is... Kaji comes from somewhere else.

678
00:46:21,756 --> 00:46:25,330
Speaker 1: In the end of Evangelion, spoilers, all those white ones show up.

679
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:27,915
Speaker 1: It's like, where did they come from?

680
00:46:27,935 --> 00:46:34,230
Speaker 1: The movies actually go and show you what's going on around other parts of the world.

681
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:36,978
Speaker 0: You see Kaji doing his spy shit.

682
00:46:37,018 --> 00:46:40,710
Speaker 0: You see the place where the things come from.

683
00:46:41,111 --> 00:46:45,068
Speaker 0: I'm trying not to talk about that, but the place where the things come from.

684
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:54,910
Speaker 1: There's a lot of blanks that got filled in, and it's not new information, because all that stuff was in the TV show.

685
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:58,510
Speaker 0: And that stuff was not material to the message or even the plot.

686
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:08,510
Speaker 1: Right, but because it matters for the plot of these movies, which is a different plot, they're now showing you all those things this time, before you didn't see them.

687
00:47:09,171 --> 00:47:15,750
Speaker 0: So you get to flesh out the physical events from the show and the movie, and you also get to flesh out the themes.

688
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:22,813
Speaker 0: But the moments that gave me the chills watching the movies were... There are iconic scenes in the show.

689
00:47:22,913 --> 00:47:33,550
Speaker 0: The one I'm thinking of very specifically is when the skull-faced alien gets near terminal dogma and is staring Masato in the face.

690
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:39,049
Speaker 0: That scene in the show is one of the most haunting scenes in the entire show to me.

691
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:52,690
Speaker 0: And that exact same scene, with very different events leading up to it and very different events happening after it, but the two worlds almost converge into that scene being identical in the second movie.

692
00:47:53,810 --> 00:48:03,710
Speaker 0: And the fact that the two stories I've seen intersected so perfectly and then diverge again at that moment, that stuck with me.

693
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:14,530
Speaker 0: And that is how the whole of these two sets of tellings of the story, the episodes versus the movies, are greater than the sum of their parts.

694
00:48:15,593 --> 00:48:29,250
Speaker 1: So the second movie, unlike the first movie, while it's pretty much all stuff that did not happen in the TV show, it still is sort of like almost slightly altered events from the TV show.

695
00:48:30,112 --> 00:48:36,650
Speaker 1: There are things that happen in the TV show that kind of happen in the second movie differently, mixed up a little bit.

696
00:48:37,591 --> 00:48:39,902
Speaker 0: Some things from later in the show happen then.

697
00:48:40,264 --> 00:48:41,370
Speaker 0: Brand new things happen.

698
00:48:41,891 --> 00:48:51,949
Speaker 0: But the atmosphere is different, because the thing about these movies that's so striking is that each movie has a radically different vibe and feeling and mood.

699
00:48:53,010 --> 00:49:02,490
Speaker 0: The second movie really focuses on the scale of what humanity has built, but also the fact that Earth is teeming with life.

700
00:49:03,312 --> 00:49:10,950
Speaker 0: This positive optimism of humans were trying to save the world, and all the atmospheric scenes, it's not the cicadas.

701
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:15,589
Speaker 1: That's what comes from the old robot shows that Evangelion is one of.

702
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:28,389
Speaker 0: But instead of all the cicadas and the emptiness that is so pervasive in the original show, you see a world filled with people, teeming with life, going about their days, trying to survive and rebuild.

703
00:49:29,553 --> 00:49:34,950
Speaker 0: And I think that's really epitomized by the scene where Kaji takes them on the field trip with the ocean stuff.

704
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:45,370
Speaker 0: And then it all kind of goes to shit, and the third movie is more like the empty times, coupled with things that are very hard to talk about without spoiling huge things.

705
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:50,730
Speaker 1: So the third movie basically has no overlap with the original TV show whatsoever.

706
00:49:51,431 --> 00:50:00,929
Speaker 1: It's like the first movie, you're on the TV side, the second movie is sort of like this border space, and the third movie is completely in a new thing.

707
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:06,698
Speaker 0: The second movie is off the rails, but you're still in the same universe.

708
00:50:06,718 --> 00:50:14,789
Speaker 0: You're on a train and the scenery is very different, but you're still like, "Alright, I see how this track came from the track I was

709
00:50:14,949 --> 00:50:15,009
Speaker 0: on.".

710
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:20,770
Speaker 0: And then after that, it's just like the train has fallen off a cliff and is in space somehow.

711
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:30,690
Speaker 1: Right, and so there's four movies, and somehow, even though these are four anime movies, you know they're going to be four of them, they're in a series.

712
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:38,950
Speaker 1: Usually, when you are going to make an anime series, even Evangelion, you save your terrible secret of space for the last few episodes.

713
00:50:39,351 --> 00:50:46,730
Speaker 0: No, the terrible secret of space goes beyond what you would have possibly ever expected before the end of the second movie.

714
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:48,151
Speaker 1: Right.

715
00:50:48,332 --> 00:50:55,390
Speaker 1: Here, it's like each individual movie goes terrible secret of space at the end, even though the first one only does a little bit.

716
00:50:57,152 --> 00:51:02,590
Speaker 1: And it's like, how was the end of the third movie not the end of the whole thing?

717
00:51:03,791 --> 00:51:12,970
Speaker 0: I mean, the end of the second movie, but for something that happens in the final seconds of it, could have been the end of Evangelion.

718
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:14,709
Speaker 1: Yeah, it could have just been.

719
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:19,061
Speaker 0: And I say that literally as in, remember the movie end of Evangelion?

720
00:51:19,101 --> 00:51:22,730
Speaker 0: Like, yup, sure, that is literally the end, game over.

721
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:30,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like the events that happen in each of the movies are so climactic, they could be, you know, it's just like four ends.

722
00:51:31,811 --> 00:51:38,230
Speaker 1: It's like the power, you know, usually animes save up their power for the end and then release the full blast.

723
00:51:38,571 --> 00:51:44,103
Speaker 0: This is more like Promare, the movie, where it just keeps escalating and escalating and escalating.

724
00:51:44,344 --> 00:51:46,910
Speaker 0: It's like a song that just keeps swelling and no point dies down.

725
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:53,069
Speaker 1: This is the thing out of Revolver and there's four bullets in the Revolver and they're all maximum power and they go one, two, three, four.

726
00:51:54,271 --> 00:51:56,595
Speaker 1: But, Rim hasn't seen the fourth one.

727
00:51:57,437 --> 00:52:03,890
Speaker 1: The fourth one, so a Revolver usually has six shots, so let's say the first movie is one bullet comes out.

728
00:52:05,392 --> 00:52:06,455
Speaker 1: Maybe it grazes you.

729
00:52:06,475 --> 00:52:10,650
Speaker 1: The second and third movies, there's just one bullet each and they hit you.

730
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:11,930
Speaker 0: Like right in the forehead.

731
00:52:13,633 --> 00:52:19,010
Speaker 1: And then the fourth movie is all three remaining shots come out at once.

732
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:27,030
Speaker 1: The fourth movie is like too much for a human being that can process Evangelion.

733
00:52:27,631 --> 00:52:29,676
Speaker 0: I'll put it this way.

734
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:39,065
Speaker 0: After having only seen two, I was messaging Scott like a while ago and then again I was like, "Yeah, we're gonna have to do like a whole separate Final Thoughts because I have too much to say so

735
00:52:39,085 --> 00:52:39,145
Speaker 0: far.".

736
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:42,847
Speaker 0: And then Scott was like, "Yeah, you haven't even seen the fourth

737
00:52:42,968 --> 00:52:43,029
Speaker 0: one.".

738
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:44,737
Speaker 1: You still haven't seen the fourth one.

739
00:52:44,777 --> 00:52:46,445
Speaker 1: You really don't know anything.

740
00:52:46,485 --> 00:52:47,390
Speaker 1: the fuck is going on.

741
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:51,909
Speaker 0: I already think I have like hours of things to say so far.

742
00:52:53,451 --> 00:52:55,980
Speaker 1: Well, the last one will give you a year of things to say.

743
00:52:56,964 --> 00:52:58,690
Speaker 1: Or maybe you won't be able to say a damn thing.

744
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:00,997
Speaker 1: You'll be like, "Well, I got nothing to say.

745
00:53:02,041 --> 00:53:02,823
Speaker 1: That shut me up.

746
00:53:03,526 --> 00:53:03,787
Speaker 1: It's so

747
00:53:03,827 --> 00:53:04,248
Speaker 1: powerful.".

748
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:19,910
Speaker 0: But I really enjoy these movies and it is hard to think of any media I've encountered where this like two different angles intersecting, two different views of the same story complement each other so well.

749
00:53:22,772 --> 00:53:30,390
Speaker 1: But yeah, this is, you know, thankfully, I guess, you know, it's the end of the real end of Evangelion, right?

750
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:32,156
Speaker 1: There will be no more Evas after this.

751
00:53:32,176 --> 00:53:35,145
Speaker 1: You know, the mangas, I think, are done, right?

752
00:53:35,165 --> 00:53:36,550
Speaker 1: TV shows done, movies are done.

753
00:53:37,171 --> 00:53:41,690
Speaker 1: You know, they're gonna never make any more Evangelion anything ever again.

754
00:53:43,172 --> 00:53:44,706
Speaker 0: This is no more Evas.

755
00:53:44,807 --> 00:53:45,130
Speaker 1: The end.

756
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:52,410
Speaker 0: So I will say, I read a lot of the manga, but I never finished it because it wasn't done at the time I was reading it, which was a long goddamn time ago.

757
00:53:54,231 --> 00:54:06,949
Speaker 0: What I remember about the manga was that it felt like the show, but with a lot more context and it went way deeper into everything, but still very close, stuck very closely to the show.

758
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:20,290
Speaker 0: So I can't say yet, having not seen the fourth movie, if the manga is like a necessary part of this triptych or if the show and the movies together are like the thing.

759
00:54:22,486 --> 00:54:24,138
Speaker 0: And you haven't read the manga at all, I don't think so.

760
00:54:24,974 --> 00:54:25,099
Speaker 1: Nope.

761
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:26,422
Speaker 0: The manga is real good.

762
00:54:26,522 --> 00:54:34,220
Speaker 0: Like, you get a lot of Futsuki, you get a lot of Kaji, you get a lot, like the watermelon scenes are way, way longer.

763
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:37,110
Speaker 0: Characters conversations are just real and long.

764
00:54:37,592 --> 00:54:39,380
Speaker 0: But again, I didn't finish the manga, so.

765
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:44,350
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, I guess just, you know, superficially, character wise, right?

766
00:54:45,352 --> 00:54:47,980
Speaker 1: The movies have more Futsuki Friday.

767
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:49,660
Speaker 0: Yep, I like Futsuki a lot.

768
00:54:50,682 --> 00:54:53,259
Speaker 1: They have less Ritsuko going on.

769
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:58,740
Speaker 0: Yep, like the show really explores Ritsuko and the Magi, and that is not really a thing in these movies.

770
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:01,399
Speaker 0: Like it's a thing, but it's not like a major...

771
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:07,000
Speaker 1: They mention the three Magi quite a few times, but they don't tell you what they are in the movies, they don't show the plot around them.

772
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:13,740
Speaker 0: So think of it this way, in the movies, the three Magi are like what one of the nerve bases disappearing in the show is.

773
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:19,700
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, that happens, people react to it, it's part of the fiction of the universe, but it's not explored deeper.

774
00:55:21,143 --> 00:55:24,980
Speaker 1: Yep, and I think that's why Ritsuko has less, you know, action.

775
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:33,000
Speaker 1: Kaji in the movies is somewhat similar to the TV show where he comes in big, right, as a huge part.

776
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:36,437
Speaker 1: He's like, it's Kaji, the Kaji stuff, and then not, right?

777
00:55:36,477 --> 00:55:36,980
Speaker 1: And then he's done.

778
00:55:37,681 --> 00:55:39,360
Speaker 1: It's like, alright, that was the Kaji part.

779
00:55:39,549 --> 00:55:39,697
Speaker 0: Yep.

780
00:55:43,448 --> 00:55:43,980
Speaker 0: It's hard to say.

781
00:55:44,101 --> 00:55:46,397
Speaker 1: And then there's new characters that weren't even in the...

782
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:54,880
Speaker 0: I guess all this, one thing I can say is that before I watched these, I remember seeing the new character and thinking, really?

783
00:55:55,340 --> 00:56:02,480
Speaker 0: You just put another boob girl in and that's okay, Anna, whatever, but I like that character a lot, that character works well.

784
00:56:04,372 --> 00:56:04,620
Speaker 1: It's hard.

785
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,360
Speaker 1: The character is there for a reason, I guess.

786
00:56:07,925 --> 00:56:08,029
Speaker 1: Yep.

787
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:18,900
Speaker 0: It really makes a scene at the end of the second movie work and make sense and give you a lot of context for what happens.

788
00:56:20,061 --> 00:56:26,920
Speaker 0: Like, imagine a character who does the thing by accident versus a character who was trying to do the thing on purpose.

789
00:56:29,121 --> 00:56:34,359
Speaker 0: Which, in a way, contextualizes what Kaji was up to in the original show but kind of failed at.

790
00:56:36,741 --> 00:56:41,180
Speaker 1: Anyway, so we'll talk about this again once Rim has seen the fourth movie so he knows what he's talking about.

791
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:46,020
Speaker 0: Also, I've really, like, it's hard to, like, we're dancing around stuff a lot because I want to talk specifics.

792
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:47,789
Speaker 1: I don't know why you just don't go watch the fourth movie.

793
00:56:47,829 --> 00:56:48,835
Speaker 1: It just took me two days.

794
00:56:48,855 --> 00:56:49,700
Speaker 1: I don't know what you're waiting for.

795
00:56:50,041 --> 00:56:50,938
Speaker 1: It's sitting right there.

796
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:51,580
Speaker 1: I'm busy.

797
00:56:51,901 --> 00:56:52,875
Speaker 1: It doesn't cost you anything.

798
00:56:52,895 --> 00:56:53,260
Speaker 1: You have Amazon.

799
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:57,060
Speaker 0: I'm still mulling over the other ones, so... I'm mulling.

800
00:56:58,142 --> 00:56:59,760
Speaker 1: You can watch them as many times as you need.

801
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:01,147
Speaker 0: Oh, they're getting watched again.

802
00:57:01,429 --> 00:57:03,119
Speaker 0: The only one I'm not going to watch again is the first one.

803
00:57:03,948 --> 00:57:04,999
Speaker 1: Bring a notepad if you need to.

804
00:57:06,461 --> 00:57:12,120
Speaker 0: So, yeah, my advice to you, if you have never seen any Evangelion, go watch the original show.

805
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,880
Speaker 0: Like, goddamn, there's a reason people keep talking about it.

806
00:57:15,521 --> 00:57:22,276
Speaker 1: And try not to, you know, it's like, yeah, you could watch it on Netflix if you have to, but really, you want to find... I have, you know, DVD...

807
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,752
Speaker 0: There's a platinum, like, DVD release.

808
00:57:24,812 --> 00:57:26,160
Speaker 0: that is, like, the one to watch.

809
00:57:26,761 --> 00:57:31,920
Speaker 1: That's the one because it has the director's cuts which have a few key scenes in some later episodes.

810
00:57:32,442 --> 00:57:36,980
Speaker 1: And you have the original openers and enders with the Japanese audio, the English song...

811
00:57:37,101 --> 00:57:53,620
Speaker 0: And those key scenes, while they're not strictly necessary, they basically... There's a couple of scenes in that director's cut that, if you're watching the show for the first time, you'll go, "Oh, I get it," about some moderately critical plot points of, like, why Sele and certain things are doing what they're doing.

812
00:57:54,081 --> 00:57:57,360
Speaker 0: That is a little bit more obtuse without those scenes.

813
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,920
Speaker 0: Like, still sus-outable, but...

814
00:58:01,965 --> 00:58:03,780
Speaker 1: They're quite helpful scenes that have been added.

815
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:08,320
Speaker 1: So, yeah, that's the ideal Evangelion TV to watch.

816
00:58:08,721 --> 00:58:11,260
Speaker 1: And then, yeah, after that, now you can watch these movies.

817
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:15,480
Speaker 1: You can watch these movies without watching the TV show, as if it's its own thing.

818
00:58:15,803 --> 00:58:16,178
Speaker 0: I wouldn't.

819
00:58:17,283 --> 00:58:21,578
Speaker 1: But, yeah, it's like, I think, A, they're not as good as the TV show, right?

820
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:27,160
Speaker 1: And B, a lot of stuff is just gonna, like, just be a miss.

821
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:27,748
Speaker 1: You're gonna be like,

822
00:58:27,829 --> 00:58:27,992
Speaker 1: "What?".

823
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:28,468
Speaker 0: Yup.

824
00:58:29,785 --> 00:58:30,677
Speaker 1: What the heck is that?

825
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:38,708
Speaker 1: I understand, like, you know, the meaning of a lot of the things that happen in these movies, even though it's not like.

826
00:58:38,748 --> 00:58:41,800
Speaker 1: there's some, you know, prerequisite knowledge.

827
00:58:41,901 --> 00:58:43,560
Speaker 1: You can't follow what's happening.

828
00:58:44,583 --> 00:58:46,320
Speaker 1: You know, they do stand alone.

829
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:46,792
Speaker 0: Yup.

830
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:49,768
Speaker 0: But there's a difference between "What the fuck was

831
00:58:49,868 --> 00:58:50,209
Speaker 0: that?"

832
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:53,299
Speaker 0: versus "Why the fuck did the Spear of Longinus

833
00:58:53,379 --> 00:58:53,560
Speaker 0: appear?".

834
00:58:54,541 --> 00:58:55,362
Speaker 1: Well, it's more like.

835
00:58:55,382 --> 00:59:05,100
Speaker 1: the importance and meaning of what you're seeing only makes sense in contrast against the original TV show.

836
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:06,280
Speaker 0: I think that's a very important point.

837
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:12,220
Speaker 0: The contrast between the two is a huge part of why they complement each other so well.

838
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:13,797
Speaker 1: Right.

839
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:19,680
Speaker 1: So, it's like, if you watch the movies, you know, it's sort of like watching, like, a, alone, and you've never seen the TV show ever.

840
00:59:20,303 --> 00:59:22,160
Speaker 1: It's like watching a silhouette play.

841
00:59:22,441 --> 00:59:26,980
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, you can follow who the characters are and what's happening and hear all the dialogue and you know what happened.

842
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:30,300
Speaker 1: But you're just seeing, like, the black outline.

843
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:38,000
Speaker 1: If you've seen the real TV show, now, even if you're looking at the silhouette, it's all filled in because you know what the hell everything is.

844
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:38,475
Speaker 0: Yup.

845
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:44,060
Speaker 0: So, yeah, we've gone on pretty long just reviewing these without spoiling anything.

846
00:59:44,203 --> 00:59:45,180
Speaker 0: So, stay tuned.

847
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:51,020
Speaker 0: We'll record our, like, super long spoiler episode probably without news or anything because we'll need some time.

848
00:59:51,729 --> 00:59:52,479
Speaker 0: And, yeah, watch these.

849
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:53,438
Speaker 1: We might need to do two.

850
00:59:53,701 --> 00:59:53,989
Speaker 1: One for...

851
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:54,556
Speaker 0: Yeah.

852
00:59:55,345 --> 00:59:55,577
Speaker 0: Four.

853
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:56,740
Speaker 0: Well, three.

854
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,680
Speaker 1: See how much material you get from that fourth movie.

855
00:59:59,086 --> 00:59:59,152
Speaker 0: Yup.

856
01:00:00,101 --> 01:00:04,299
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah, I don't know what else we can say except you should watch these.

857
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course.

858
01:00:06,862 --> 01:00:08,060
Speaker 1: It's an animated movie.
