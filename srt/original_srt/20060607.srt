1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,453
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday June 7th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:13,473 --> 00:00:15,480
Speaker 1: We bring you our coverage of Philly wizard world.

3
00:00:16,742 --> 00:00:17,758
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:18,962 --> 00:00:22,520
Speaker 1: So anyone who breathes knows just how much I hate Sony.

5
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:29,440
Speaker 1: But I really have to reiterate today after the craft they put me through there are people who don't know you and they breathe.

6
00:00:29,741 --> 00:00:30,665
Speaker 1: Oh, they know.

7
00:00:30,966 --> 00:00:34,420
Speaker 1: kids born today their first words are Wow rim hates Sony.

8
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:37,468
Speaker 1: It's like those worms in that Family Guy episode.

9
00:00:37,488 --> 00:00:44,012
Speaker 1: all right all right, so I go to conventions And I've got my little Sony ICD p320.

10
00:00:44,053 --> 00:00:47,285
Speaker 0: now if you hate them so much Why did you buy one of their products?

11
00:00:47,626 --> 00:00:48,208
Speaker 1: You know why?

12
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:55,099
Speaker 1: because there really aren't any good products in this area and Hardware wise Sony makes the best one.

13
00:00:55,962 --> 00:01:01,520
Speaker 1: Now hardware wise I want I can't stress this enough this little piece of hardware that Sony made is awesome.

14
00:01:02,082 --> 00:01:03,206
Speaker 1: It's very good at recording.

15
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:05,494
Speaker 1: I can plug my big external mic into it.

16
00:01:05,513 --> 00:01:05,734
Speaker 1: it works.

17
00:01:05,754 --> 00:01:06,196
Speaker 1: Just fine.

18
00:01:06,216 --> 00:01:07,320
Speaker 1: it records tons of audio.

19
00:01:07,802 --> 00:01:09,830
Speaker 1: It's a really good little thing and I love it.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,788
Speaker 1: Now it has a little USB bit on the side and the USB bit Theoretically allows me to get the wave files.

21
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:23,823
Speaker 1: I've recorded off of it, so I can use them to make geek nights In order to get the wave files off.

22
00:01:23,843 --> 00:01:38,340
Speaker 1: there is one and only one way I have to run the software for Windows only on The CD that Sony gave me and The sheer amount of DRM that they have put into this little CD is staggering.

23
00:01:39,922 --> 00:01:45,620
Speaker 0: So they give you a huge pile of DRM to protect things that you recorded.

24
00:01:46,303 --> 00:01:59,000
Speaker 1: Well if you're recording apparently I might record something unauthorized and then try to put it on my computer or Put a song on here in the crap quality that it records and then give it to someone else.

25
00:01:59,823 --> 00:02:00,929
Speaker 0: And how this DRM?

26
00:02:00,949 --> 00:02:01,210
Speaker 0: though?

27
00:02:01,773 --> 00:02:06,539
Speaker 0: even if you use the Sony software There's nothing to stop you from doing that.

28
00:02:07,821 --> 00:02:09,588
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, there is you can't.

29
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:14,507
Speaker 1: if you put a file on to this recorder from a computer You cannot get it back off.

30
00:02:14,808 --> 00:02:16,214
Speaker 1: It's flagged as un gettable.

31
00:02:16,495 --> 00:02:17,820
Speaker 1: that way you can't share anything.

32
00:02:18,623 --> 00:02:28,000
Speaker 1: it also flags things based on what computer and user ID recorded them and If you're not the same user ID you can't get it back off of the device.

33
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,399
Speaker 1: You can only put things on the device.

34
00:02:29,721 --> 00:02:36,287
Speaker 0: But what if you go to a concert record something on the device take the device home take the wave file off make an mp3 And send it around the net?

35
00:02:36,871 --> 00:02:38,040
Speaker 1: that I can do just fine.

36
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,312
Speaker 0: That's the only thing they should be worried about.

37
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:41,660
Speaker 0: no one else is gonna pirate.

38
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,864
Speaker 0: I think in another way.

39
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:47,740
Speaker 1: it only lets me get the file back off in a lower quality than the thing can actually do.

40
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,805
Speaker 1: Yeah, and further it.

41
00:02:51,086 --> 00:02:54,800
Speaker 1: it's really I don't know what they're trying to protect because I got all my stuff off of here.

42
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,543
Speaker 1: Just fine.

43
00:02:55,583 --> 00:03:04,350
Speaker 1: It just took me a lot of wrangling and cheating and uninstalling and reinstalling the software And it's just also I can't get it to work in wine.

44
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:09,820
Speaker 1: There's no Linux version and even though it's a USB device It's not just a USB flash hard drive.

45
00:03:10,302 --> 00:03:15,560
Speaker 1: It's a special proprietary thing that Linux just can't deal with and Windows can't even deal with.

46
00:03:15,961 --> 00:03:22,120
Speaker 1: Only the software you get from Sony that is also difficult to uninstall and I think does bad things can get the stuff off.

47
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:23,163
Speaker 0: Why don't?

48
00:03:23,525 --> 00:03:24,528
Speaker 0: you might have gotten root-kitted.

49
00:03:25,191 --> 00:03:25,552
Speaker 1: you know what?

50
00:03:25,592 --> 00:03:27,720
Speaker 1: that's fine, I actually expect that I got root-kitted.

51
00:03:28,142 --> 00:03:32,380
Speaker 1: I don't use that Windows for anything anything in the world other than the stupid Sony recording.

52
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,752
Speaker 0: But why don't we make a recording bit that doesn't have DRM and sell it?

53
00:03:36,515 --> 00:03:36,936
Speaker 1: you know what?

54
00:03:36,976 --> 00:03:39,936
Speaker 1: that's not a bad idea It's not at all though.

55
00:03:39,956 --> 00:03:44,112
Speaker 1: I think Eventually, I'll just buy a good SSR from a reputable company.

56
00:03:44,172 --> 00:03:47,685
Speaker 1: the problem is I have to get a professional one that cost hundreds of Dollars more than this thing.

57
00:03:47,886 --> 00:03:50,600
Speaker 0: yep, those are pretty expensive, but also pretty awesome.

58
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:58,565
Speaker 1: They even have those super microphone inputs and all that jazz, so if you needed one more reason to hate Sony Damn it.

59
00:03:59,253 --> 00:04:04,534
Speaker 1: Yeah Alright yeah, anything happened to you today while I was at work.

60
00:04:04,554 --> 00:04:09,273
Speaker 0: I said at work all day Reading comics so not working.

61
00:04:09,634 --> 00:04:10,457
Speaker 0: No not working.

62
00:04:10,477 --> 00:04:11,120
Speaker 0: then I came home.

63
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,933
Speaker 1: Surprisingly you came home not too long before I did.

64
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:15,716
Speaker 0: I had to stop.

65
00:04:15,937 --> 00:04:16,500
Speaker 0: it was raining.

66
00:04:16,922 --> 00:04:17,223
Speaker 0: I left.

67
00:04:17,284 --> 00:04:17,927
Speaker 1: yes, it was raining.

68
00:04:17,947 --> 00:04:20,220
Speaker 0: I left work a little late cuz I had to finish reading the comic.

69
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,366
Speaker 1: Oh, you tell me about rain.

70
00:04:21,406 --> 00:04:25,164
Speaker 1: I woke up, and it wasn't sunny, but it was nice out here I didn't.

71
00:04:25,305 --> 00:04:28,040
Speaker 1: it didn't look like it was gonna rain hard if at all when I woke up.

72
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:29,764
Speaker 1: So I drove to work.

73
00:04:29,904 --> 00:04:34,079
Speaker 1: You know 50 miles to the south into a fucking rainstorm.

74
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:40,704
Speaker 1: Rim does not own an umbrella and rim did not bring a coat and rim has to park far away from his job and walk Around in the Bronx.

75
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:42,594
Speaker 0: I lost my umbrella.

76
00:04:42,614 --> 00:04:43,559
Speaker 0: I need to buy a new one.

77
00:04:44,143 --> 00:04:48,248
Speaker 0: I had a broken umbrella, and then I left another umbrella on the trains And I need to buy my third umbrella.

78
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,823
Speaker 1: Emily found an umbrella that she thought was mine But wasn't.

79
00:04:50,863 --> 00:04:52,614
Speaker 1: but I took it anyway, and then it broke.

80
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:55,985
Speaker 0: It was just a crap By the newsstand city umbrella.

81
00:04:56,106 --> 00:04:59,174
Speaker 1: it served me well for about four rainstorms.

82
00:04:59,214 --> 00:05:00,778
Speaker 0: That's about how long those things last.

83
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:01,440
Speaker 1: it fell apart.

84
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,440
Speaker 1: I think Katsu or someone was swinging around like a sword, and it just went whoop.

85
00:05:05,561 --> 00:05:06,925
Speaker 1: Well, it wasn't the best thing.

86
00:05:07,326 --> 00:05:08,089
Speaker 0: no not at all.

87
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:08,811
Speaker 1: We're just fine.

88
00:05:08,911 --> 00:05:10,296
Speaker 1: I'm kind of against umbrellas.

89
00:05:10,316 --> 00:05:12,885
Speaker 0: I Pro umbrella.

90
00:05:12,905 --> 00:05:16,899
Speaker 1: I prefer wearing a big long coat and a hat as opposed to having an umbrella.

91
00:05:17,602 --> 00:05:19,530
Speaker 0: No, no one's making you use an umbrella.

92
00:05:19,751 --> 00:05:20,153
Speaker 1: You know what?

93
00:05:20,173 --> 00:05:25,512
Speaker 0: damn straight, but I'll take an umbrella if I have the chance, and it's raining.

94
00:05:25,532 --> 00:05:27,260
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna use one any non rain.

95
00:05:27,663 --> 00:05:33,394
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a bit silly unless it's a parasol Or a Sunbrella.

96
00:05:34,621 --> 00:05:37,582
Speaker 0: Not gonna use those Sunbrella.

97
00:05:37,602 --> 00:05:39,600
Speaker 1: yeah, what if you are an albino?

98
00:05:41,122 --> 00:05:45,300
Speaker 1: I'm not an albino, but what if you were say you were an albino now at that point?

99
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,700
Speaker 1: Would you be okay with using a Sunbrella?

100
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:56,603
Speaker 0: If I was an albino I'd probably just stay inside Not even if you had magic powers like powder Who?

101
00:05:57,325 --> 00:05:58,629
Speaker 1: Wow okay never mind?

102
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,094
Speaker 1: I've never seen that movie.

103
00:06:00,355 --> 00:06:01,920
Speaker 0: What movie is that powder?

104
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:04,992
Speaker 1: Okay, it's about an albino guy with magic power.

105
00:06:05,153 --> 00:06:10,274
Speaker 1: I figured that out And in the end society doesn't understand him, and then he disappears.

106
00:06:10,756 --> 00:06:13,425
Speaker 0: really yeah That sucks.

107
00:06:13,465 --> 00:06:16,200
Speaker 0: in the end you should use his magic powers to fuck society.

108
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:22,740
Speaker 1: No uses magic powers to save the one person who wasn't totally afraid of him, and then he runs away And no one really learns a lesson.

109
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:30,694
Speaker 1: stupid albinos Alright, so you couldn't get some trouble finding some news, so what'd you dig up?

110
00:06:31,236 --> 00:06:37,120
Speaker 0: I think we'll just Instead of saving it for next Tuesday will and say it's anime day.

111
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,393
Speaker 0: I want to do anime news, but there's also a big video game news.

112
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:42,757
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I don't know.

113
00:06:42,857 --> 00:06:43,680
Speaker 0: they're both kind of quick.

114
00:06:44,883 --> 00:06:53,268
Speaker 0: The big video game news is that there's new Smash Brothers Character roster announcements going down.

115
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:57,660
Speaker 1: I am jumping up and down in my seat right now because one of them was a Scott prediction.

116
00:06:58,142 --> 00:07:08,878
Speaker 0: Yeah, not only a Scott prediction, but a right up rims-alley prediction, that's right a Yeah, so let's see first who are they taking out of Smash Brothers?

117
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,620
Speaker 1: well They're taking out young link which I'm fine with because no one cared about young link.

118
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,105
Speaker 0: He's like who's little link.

119
00:07:14,405 --> 00:07:15,770
Speaker 1: the same people use Pichu.

120
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:20,060
Speaker 1: yeah Pichu exists solely for the penis combination exactly.

121
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,408
Speaker 0: They also took out ice climbers.

122
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:25,134
Speaker 1: You see I'm kind of sad about that.

123
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:26,860
Speaker 1: I thought ice climbers was a neat character.

124
00:07:27,962 --> 00:07:31,037
Speaker 0: I thought ice climbers could you know the character?

125
00:07:31,057 --> 00:07:31,138
Speaker 0: fine?

126
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:40,955
Speaker 0: But the problem with them was that there was the duality of having two ice climbers But they didn't actually have any innovative way to use that.

127
00:07:41,015 --> 00:07:45,071
Speaker 0: like you couldn't have one ice climber Somewhere beating up one guy with the other one beating up another guy.

128
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:50,836
Speaker 0: You're pretty much one ice climber with this Ball and chain other ice climber hanging on to you.

129
00:07:51,098 --> 00:07:54,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, though I've seen videos of people doing crazy stuff with those eyes.

130
00:07:54,582 --> 00:07:58,877
Speaker 0: People do crazy stuff with anyone, but I just it wasn't really fun or exciting.

131
00:07:58,997 --> 00:07:59,600
Speaker 1: I found it fun.

132
00:08:00,082 --> 00:08:02,674
Speaker 1: Yeah, I couldn't use the characters for shit, but I thought they were cool.

133
00:08:02,895 --> 00:08:06,086
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm and Mr.. Game & Watch got cut.

134
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:07,211
Speaker 0: I like mr.. Game & Watch.

135
00:08:07,231 --> 00:08:09,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, even though he's a lot like Mewtwo.

136
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:09,702
Speaker 0: Yeah, he was.

137
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,347
Speaker 0: he's not like Mewtwo at all.

138
00:08:11,547 --> 00:08:13,353
Speaker 1: He feels that way like he jumps.

139
00:08:13,413 --> 00:08:15,500
Speaker 1: He falls a little slowly, and he's kind of woo.

140
00:08:17,341 --> 00:08:25,485
Speaker 0: Not really yeah, but mr.. Game & Watch like the character again was cool But I thought his moves were pretty much Completely standard in every way.

141
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:29,577
Speaker 0: and there's already Mario who has completely standard moves and dr.

142
00:08:29,617 --> 00:08:30,500
Speaker 0: Mario and Luigi.

143
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,000
Speaker 1: How standard is flipping flapjacks at someone?

144
00:08:35,102 --> 00:08:35,464
Speaker 0: It's a pretty.

145
00:08:35,504 --> 00:08:37,215
Speaker 0: It's just a standard kind of projectile.

146
00:08:37,275 --> 00:08:37,698
Speaker 0: It's not right.

147
00:08:37,738 --> 00:08:38,100
Speaker 1: wait a minute.

148
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,179
Speaker 1: So apparently all the characters is standard cuz either have a sword a projectile a jump fist kind of thing.

149
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:48,098
Speaker 0: He didn't have anything to differentiate him fighting wise from a lot of the other characters.

150
00:08:48,118 --> 00:08:48,700
Speaker 0: all right.

151
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,272
Speaker 1: Then what's the difference between say Roy and?

152
00:08:52,861 --> 00:08:53,745
Speaker 0: Link nothing.

153
00:08:53,765 --> 00:08:54,990
Speaker 0: they're both sword guys.

154
00:08:55,051 --> 00:08:55,372
Speaker 0: That's my.

155
00:08:55,392 --> 00:09:01,673
Speaker 0: that's what I'm saying is that in Smash Brothers They should really cut out the characters who fight similarly.

156
00:09:01,693 --> 00:09:02,977
Speaker 1: all right, so get rid of Luigi.

157
00:09:05,906 --> 00:09:18,040
Speaker 0: Well, you know you can keep them in there, but why bother making a whole separate character Which is moves that are crooks slightly different have like different fighting styles like sword guy generic guy gun guy?

158
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,683
Speaker 0: Etc.

159
00:09:18,904 --> 00:09:23,880
Speaker 0: and then just you can pick a model so you'd go to sword guy And there'd be like 50 sword guys to choose from it.

160
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,633
Speaker 0: It changes the way the model you use, but it's still.

161
00:09:26,874 --> 00:09:27,859
Speaker 0: they fight like a sword guy.

162
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:35,860
Speaker 0: People seem to like the fact that they're all crooks slightly I know, but the thing is this way you could really please a lot of people by having a zillion characters.

163
00:09:36,122 --> 00:09:38,017
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I think you take a lot of people off too.

164
00:09:39,142 --> 00:09:48,548
Speaker 0: But then you could also say there was sword guy link and then sword guy Meta Knight, but you know they would be.

165
00:09:48,568 --> 00:09:56,605
Speaker 0: you know while their basic moves would be very similar They would all you could crook each one a little tiny bit like You know.

166
00:09:56,645 --> 00:10:00,160
Speaker 0: maybe ones faster one slower kind of like different carts in Mario Kart.

167
00:10:00,582 --> 00:10:02,735
Speaker 0: You know you just move the meters around for each one.

168
00:10:02,755 --> 00:10:06,985
Speaker 0: Yeah I don't know it.

169
00:10:07,005 --> 00:10:09,975
Speaker 0: just I felt that a lot of the characters and melee were redundant.

170
00:10:09,995 --> 00:10:14,860
Speaker 0: so getting rid of these characters Removes a little bit of that, but now for the added characters.

171
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,766
Speaker 0: Scott's prediction kid Koopa.

172
00:10:18,027 --> 00:10:24,024
Speaker 1: Oh my god if anyone out there knows me I play kid Koopa Exclusively in any game.

173
00:10:24,105 --> 00:10:27,777
Speaker 1: I play where it's an option, and I defy you to pick it before me.

174
00:10:27,797 --> 00:10:31,436
Speaker 0: well I'm smash brothers is okay, cuz they're gonna be for kid Koopas at once.

175
00:10:31,677 --> 00:10:35,205
Speaker 1: ha ha Koopa.

176
00:10:35,387 --> 00:10:36,905
Speaker 1: I just really like kid Koopa I don't know.

177
00:10:36,925 --> 00:10:37,250
Speaker 1: maybe it's cuz.

178
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:44,040
Speaker 1: I like dragons And he's kind of like a little dragon maybe because I'm a big fan of Bowser, and he's like the cool punk Bowser kid.

179
00:10:45,042 --> 00:10:47,715
Speaker 1: I like his little face mask with the painted thing.

180
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:48,680
Speaker 1: I just I like him.

181
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,323
Speaker 1: I like him a lot.

182
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:52,560
Speaker 0: they got rid of kid link and they added in Wind Waker link.

183
00:10:52,700 --> 00:11:01,961
Speaker 0: We I guess that'll be fun cuz he has some cool sword moves that the other links don't have and he also has some cool items that the other links don't have and In.

184
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:12,134
Speaker 0: it'll be pretty weird to see like this cel shaded guy fighting these ultra realistic guys Any more than seeing a two-dimensional game and watch fighting everyone.

185
00:11:12,275 --> 00:11:13,158
Speaker 0: no it'll be similar.

186
00:11:13,218 --> 00:11:13,800
Speaker 0: so that kind of.

187
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:17,472
Speaker 0: So it replaces the kid link and the game and watch.

188
00:11:18,055 --> 00:11:21,237
Speaker 0: you know you just put a get Wind Waker link in there, and you're all good.

189
00:11:21,257 --> 00:11:31,860
Speaker 0: and the last one that they've added in is Oh Ridley, I think that's gonna be cool because there weren't enough non humanoid things.

190
00:11:32,141 --> 00:11:35,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, I really want to see non like weird things like.

191
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,556
Speaker 1: I'd like to see the vehicle from blaster master.

192
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:44,296
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean In Smash Brothers so far they're pretty much been three types of things.

193
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:53,360
Speaker 0: you can be humanoids Bowser and Donkey Kong which are kind of big creatures and little creatures like Kirby Pikachu and Jigglypuff etc.

194
00:11:54,222 --> 00:12:00,239
Speaker 0: So throwing in Ridley is a new kind of creature and that I think will really stir things up.

195
00:12:01,145 --> 00:12:06,600
Speaker 0: They should put in all kinds of other weird Creatures that don't fit the usual.

196
00:12:08,143 --> 00:12:14,656
Speaker 0: You know Things that are in Smash Brothers like the blaster master vehicle like the boys or the bionic commando.

197
00:12:14,977 --> 00:12:17,345
Speaker 0: bionic commandos humanoid He while he's humanoid.

198
00:12:17,385 --> 00:12:24,120
Speaker 1: He's a man who cannot lift his legs enough to jump yet He can fly around on a mechanical arm.

199
00:12:24,803 --> 00:12:28,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think the problem with him is that you pretty much have to jump in bionic commandos.

200
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,306
Speaker 0: So what if there's a flat map?

201
00:12:30,346 --> 00:12:30,768
Speaker 0: What's he gonna?

202
00:12:30,808 --> 00:12:31,974
Speaker 1: Do you know what?

203
00:12:32,637 --> 00:12:33,199
Speaker 1: I don't care?

204
00:12:34,103 --> 00:12:36,573
Speaker 1: I want him anyway, okay, and I want Megaman.

205
00:12:36,995 --> 00:12:38,240
Speaker 0: no Megaman would be good.

206
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,936
Speaker 0: But again, he yeah, similar to Samus and he's a Capcom character.

207
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:45,083
Speaker 1: So good luck though They could make a Megaman.

208
00:12:45,103 --> 00:12:53,350
Speaker 1: Well, if all of his attacks were turned into a classic Megaman bad guy with all their powers Yeah You could pull it off.

209
00:12:53,794 --> 00:12:55,621
Speaker 0: Yeah Whatever.

210
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:56,564
Speaker 0: Okay.

211
00:12:56,684 --> 00:13:01,095
Speaker 1: Anyway in my news there is someone is formed and I'm not.

212
00:13:01,135 --> 00:13:04,123
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna talk about the details because I'm not really These people.

213
00:13:04,865 --> 00:13:06,792
Speaker 1: now there is the pirates Bay.

214
00:13:07,374 --> 00:13:10,939
Speaker 1: There was also the pirate party political party over there.

215
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:16,920
Speaker 1: Yeah here in the US a bunch of people have gotten together and decided to officially legally form the pirate party in the US.

216
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,826
Speaker 0: Normally, I'd be all for that.

217
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:21,052
Speaker 1: now one their website is crap.

218
00:13:21,694 --> 00:13:23,480
Speaker 1: They don't know what they're doing.

219
00:13:23,781 --> 00:13:31,300
Speaker 1: They're very unprofessional about it and their only platform or plank as it were is this whole piracy thing.

220
00:13:32,581 --> 00:13:33,948
Speaker 1: That's not the way to do this.

221
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,119
Speaker 1: that's not the way to win the hearts and minds.

222
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:40,915
Speaker 0: Nope, if you're gonna make a political party and you expect me to get behind it.

223
00:13:41,477 --> 00:13:48,560
Speaker 0: You better be Professional and serious and have your shit together and stop playing with a knife while we're trying to make a podcast.

224
00:13:48,964 --> 00:13:49,978
Speaker 1: Why doesn't affect you?

225
00:13:51,241 --> 00:13:52,507
Speaker 0: You're obviously not paying attention.

226
00:13:52,668 --> 00:13:52,809
Speaker 0: Yes.

227
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:54,940
Speaker 0: I am you're sitting there paying attention to play with a knife.

228
00:13:55,486 --> 00:13:56,559
Speaker 1: I'm very much paying attention.

229
00:13:57,184 --> 00:13:59,180
Speaker 0: Anyway, if you're a pirate then you could play with a knife.

230
00:13:59,661 --> 00:14:09,866
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're not joining the pirate party because they're lame and maybe one day if they actually are more professional and not a bunch of losers then we'll Get behind them.

231
00:14:10,489 --> 00:14:16,260
Speaker 1: I mean I just I want to vote for third parties But at the same time I want to vote for the lesser of two evils.

232
00:14:16,882 --> 00:14:25,111
Speaker 1: But at the same time almost every third party does something I don't like and there's really no candidate out there in the world Who represents me other than well me?

233
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:27,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, I want to vote for me.

234
00:14:27,661 --> 00:14:31,332
Speaker 1: I think I'm gonna write myself in and the next election I can write in on.

235
00:14:31,934 --> 00:14:33,198
Speaker 0: I got it everyone on.

236
00:14:33,218 --> 00:14:34,503
Speaker 0: the next time There's an election.

237
00:14:34,543 --> 00:14:41,855
Speaker 0: We're just all gonna write in like Ford Prefect or something like that Or Cthulhu or something Johnny.

238
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,224
Speaker 0: Yeah There we go.

239
00:14:44,465 --> 00:14:48,096
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're just feel very disenfranchised more and more as time goes on.

240
00:14:48,798 --> 00:14:58,213
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, we should do a long show sometime on our specific political beliefs Since I think they kind of come out in the show they do.

241
00:14:58,313 --> 00:15:00,120
Speaker 1: but I get the impression that freedom.

242
00:15:00,981 --> 00:15:08,123
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've just noticed that the way them we tend to gloss over the details because we bring it up like oh girl Bush is dumber.

243
00:15:08,264 --> 00:15:09,630
Speaker 1: Oh girl back is evil.

244
00:15:10,173 --> 00:15:10,514
Speaker 1: Oh girl.

245
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:14,265
Speaker 1: The Democrats are wishy-washy but We don't I mean are.

246
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:20,507
Speaker 1: we actually have very complex political views that really don't come out in our quick arbitrary Gripping at one another.

247
00:15:20,527 --> 00:15:22,598
Speaker 0: that's fine dirty hippies.

248
00:15:25,161 --> 00:15:26,363
Speaker 1: Yeah, we heard liberals.

249
00:15:26,483 --> 00:15:28,066
Speaker 1: we are not leftists and it's right.

250
00:15:34,478 --> 00:15:35,240
Speaker 1: things of the day.

251
00:15:36,023 --> 00:15:36,103
Speaker 1: Now.

252
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,493
Speaker 1: we've talked about Sega satana sashiro before.

253
00:15:39,015 --> 00:15:43,839
Speaker 1: he's not being a thing of the day But we have periodically brought him up because we is one of our minor heroes.

254
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:46,967
Speaker 1: I've linked to my thing of the day today.

255
00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:49,235
Speaker 1: Someone has made a actually someone.

256
00:15:49,255 --> 00:15:50,740
Speaker 1: this looks like it's an old music video.

257
00:15:50,801 --> 00:16:00,445
Speaker 1: I think it's legitimate from overseas but anyway, it is a compilation set to music of almost all of Sagatons videos.

258
00:16:01,147 --> 00:16:03,776
Speaker 1: it is quite epic and awesome and I suggest you watch it.

259
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,227
Speaker 1: if You've never seen him before other than the video.

260
00:16:07,247 --> 00:16:13,920
Speaker 1: I just linked to I Strongly suggest you seek out all of his commercials and watch them all in order.

261
00:16:14,234 --> 00:16:15,245
Speaker 0: Yeah Just everyone knows.

262
00:16:15,446 --> 00:16:21,160
Speaker 0: when the Sega satan came out in Japan It was actually a lot more popular over there than it is over here with good reason.

263
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:27,060
Speaker 0: It had many many good games over there that it didn't have over here and there was a series of commercials with this guy.

264
00:16:27,622 --> 00:16:33,248
Speaker 0: And if they're awesome and famous and you should know about them Are we sure we're saying it right though?

265
00:16:33,288 --> 00:16:35,216
Speaker 0: I think it's Sega satan Shiro.

266
00:16:35,818 --> 00:16:38,299
Speaker 1: the side I linked to said Sega satan sashiro.

267
00:16:39,202 --> 00:16:47,000
Speaker 1: Maybe they say it different ways in different parts of the song and the Google video link spells it differently from the image.

268
00:16:47,321 --> 00:16:52,775
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, actually long sounds like Sega satan Shiro, you know, so I don't know.

269
00:16:53,577 --> 00:16:54,700
Speaker 1: it's it's different everywhere.

270
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,061
Speaker 1: You know what?

271
00:16:55,121 --> 00:16:55,543
Speaker 1: I don't care.

272
00:16:55,563 --> 00:16:56,526
Speaker 0: I don't care either.

273
00:16:57,047 --> 00:16:59,315
Speaker 0: But all you have to know is it's Sega Saturn.

274
00:16:59,555 --> 00:17:00,398
Speaker 1: Yeah, you'll find it.

275
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:05,530
Speaker 0: Yes my thing today It keeping you with my Smash Brothers theme.

276
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,818

277
00:17:07,858 --> 00:17:09,806
Speaker 0: Yeah, mr Hey and the same video game.

278
00:17:09,886 --> 00:17:24,020
Speaker 0: there's been a significant drought of things of the day lately on anime day but it's a video of Smash Brothers that shows jigglypuff getting smashed against the screen and And What appears to be a penis?

279
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,119
Speaker 1: Thank You Scott.

280
00:17:27,222 --> 00:17:32,200
Speaker 0: Who can resist the the hot coffee of Smash Brothers?

Speaker 1: Hey, yes Alright just in case no one Listen to that episode from a while back.

284
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:48,260
Speaker 1: There is a minor 12 year old ish Easter egg in Smash Brothers.

285
00:17:49,003 --> 00:17:50,430
Speaker 1: Now there's a character named Pichu.

286
00:17:51,074 --> 00:17:52,380
Speaker 1: there's a character named Ness.

287
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,900
Speaker 1: When you click on a character to select him the game says his name.

288
00:17:57,401 --> 00:18:01,392
Speaker 1: Therefore if you and a friend select Pichu and Ness with the proper timing.

289
00:18:01,773 --> 00:18:04,119
Speaker 1: Well, try it yourself and see what happens.

290
00:18:05,503 --> 00:18:19,055

00:18:47,512 --> 00:18:48,095
Speaker 1: What can I say?

298
00:18:48,356 --> 00:18:49,140
Speaker 0: and last weekend?

299
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,520
Speaker 0: We went to for a few hours and Saturday wizard world, Philadelphia.

300
00:18:53,881 --> 00:19:00,321
Speaker 1: Now this is unique in the cons we go to in that it is a comic convention as opposed to an anime or gaming Convention.

301
00:19:00,402 --> 00:19:03,050
Speaker 0: is this the first I've been to comic conventions before?

302
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:07,949
Speaker 0: but mostly the small kind like in a mall Never this big before.

303
00:19:07,969 --> 00:19:11,166
Speaker 1: this is like a real comic convention All right.

304
00:19:11,186 --> 00:19:13,220
Speaker 0: Shall we talk about the events in chronological order?

305
00:19:13,742 --> 00:19:17,895
Speaker 1: Alright, so it was pouring rain and it sucked driving there.

306
00:19:18,136 --> 00:19:19,500
Speaker 0: it sure sucked driving there.

307
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:26,220
Speaker 1: In fact, it had rained continuously from when we left our house until we got to Philly And then the next morning when we drove to the con it was still raining.

308
00:19:26,381 --> 00:19:33,464
Speaker 0: Yeah, we didn't have too much time finding the place or driving around Philly was a lot more pleasant than driving around say, New York Yeah, or Chicago.

309
00:19:33,544 --> 00:19:37,360
Speaker 0: It was like driving around Albany, but with roads a little bit more crowded.

310
00:19:37,481 --> 00:19:39,791
Speaker 1: I caused an accident the last time I drove in Chicago.

311
00:19:40,494 --> 00:19:42,468
Speaker 0: Oh, I've never driven in Chicago You know what?

312
00:19:42,508 --> 00:19:43,299
Speaker 1: It really sucks.

313
00:19:43,461 --> 00:19:49,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, we found parking pretty easily But since it was raining we we did have to walk through some water to get to the con.

314
00:19:50,242 --> 00:19:54,660
Speaker 0: But it was good that we waited for the line to get a bit shorter before he went over there.

315
00:19:54,921 --> 00:19:58,578
Speaker 0: We sat in the car for maybe 10 minutes, you know playing DS and whatnot.

316
00:19:59,221 --> 00:20:02,390
Speaker 0: And when we got over there the line only took about 10 minutes.

317
00:20:02,972 --> 00:20:05,620
Speaker 0: then we paid what 25 bucks for a one-day pass.

318
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:09,014
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would like to note right now that I want my 25 bucks back.

319
00:20:09,637 --> 00:20:19,412
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay 25 bucks for a con isn't a really bad deal except when the con You know doesn't provide the Oda cons.

320
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:20,295
Speaker 0: what 50 bucks?

321
00:20:20,917 --> 00:20:21,640
Speaker 1: I think they raised it.

322
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,309
Speaker 1: But yeah, there was a time when it was 50 bucks.

323
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,340
Speaker 0: All right, Oda cons about 50 bucks.

324
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,296
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna bother to look it might even be 40 for all.

325
00:20:27,357 --> 00:20:27,538
Speaker 0: I know.

326
00:20:28,322 --> 00:20:33,557
Speaker 0: That means this con would have to be half as good as Oda con not even close for one day.

327
00:20:33,838 --> 00:20:36,995
Speaker 1: Keep in mind Yeah, one day one day.

328
00:20:37,015 --> 00:20:41,010
Speaker 0: so Already the entry price is a rip.

329
00:20:41,131 --> 00:20:43,000
Speaker 0: I say ten bucks would have been fine.

330
00:20:43,362 --> 00:20:49,255
Speaker 1: Yeah, more like five, you know, we didn't go in any official capacity So we didn't get in free like her kind of used to.

331
00:20:49,275 --> 00:20:53,533
Speaker 1: yeah Yeah, now they gave us these to register into the con one.

332
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:55,340
Speaker 1: their badges were totally counterfeitable.

333
00:20:56,022 --> 00:21:07,380
Speaker 0: Okay, not only the badges were counterfeitable But I'd like to point out when you go to an anime con or a lot every con I've been to you get to either they print your name on the badge or you put your name on the badge.

334
00:21:07,745 --> 00:21:10,222
Speaker 0: these badges were just Stock.

335
00:21:10,322 --> 00:21:11,707
Speaker 1: you got a barcode.

336
00:21:11,968 --> 00:21:15,240
Speaker 1: Yeah didn't do anything because they didn't scan it or look at it or anything.

337
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,223
Speaker 1: They just stuck it in there.

338
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,048
Speaker 0: Yep, and seemed like everyone.

339
00:21:18,088 --> 00:21:21,778
Speaker 0: no one really had customized badges except maybe guests and such.

340
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,172
Speaker 1: now They gave us a survey to fill out while we were in line.

341
00:21:25,253 --> 00:21:26,639
Speaker 1: That was also a registration form.

342
00:21:27,504 --> 00:21:33,740
Speaker 1: Now aside from the fact that it asked a lot of personal questions I really didn't feel comfortable answering to a freaking comic convention.

343
00:21:34,021 --> 00:21:41,067
Speaker 1: Yeah, it had a wonderful bit where at one section and I did a little checkbox area You know a square and next to it.

344
00:21:41,108 --> 00:21:48,654
Speaker 1: It said yes, please sign me up for Affiliated blah blah blah blah blah blah blah, please send me newsletters from the convention.

345
00:21:48,834 --> 00:21:51,100
Speaker 0: people wizard because it's a wizard world convention.

346
00:21:51,465 --> 00:21:55,669
Speaker 0: So it said yes wizard Please send me all your newsletters to my email address.

347
00:21:55,789 --> 00:22:00,383
Speaker 1: now the yes was already checked off when we got it and there was no Option.

348
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:06,000
Speaker 0: so basically what it meant was if you enter your email address, you're going to get newsletters.

349
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:13,720
Speaker 0: So obviously we didn't enter our email addresses and sadly no one cared because he really wanted to fight with them on that.

350
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,457
Speaker 1: Yeah, because they also wanted like my home address and phone number and all this information.

351
00:22:18,477 --> 00:22:19,220
Speaker 1: that really wasn't cool.

352
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,638
Speaker 1: They want to know how much money we make.

353
00:22:21,242 --> 00:22:29,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean a survey is fine and I answered some of the questions But I left a lot out that I wasn't gonna tell them that they shouldn't ask.

354
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,580
Speaker 1: There was one funny question where it asked how many people did you tell you were going to Philly wizard world?

355
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:39,239
Speaker 1: And we were like hundreds and hundreds lots.

356
00:22:41,201 --> 00:22:50,530
Speaker 0: The options were like one two, three, four five six other other a lot seven plus All right, so we got our badges.

357
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,314
Speaker 0: you went in the con.

358
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,407
Speaker 0: the con Was one big room.

359
00:22:54,728 --> 00:22:56,254
Speaker 1: Well, there were other rooms outside.

360
00:22:56,274 --> 00:23:00,580
Speaker 1: That's true panels, but The most of the con was just one big room.

361
00:23:00,741 --> 00:23:08,260
Speaker 0: None of the panels are really interesting to us and some of the panels Required tickets that you had to pay for if you wanted to see Kevin Smith.

362
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,998
Speaker 0: You would have had to buy a ticket on Friday separate from your con ticket.

363
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,106
Speaker 1: now I don't like that.

364
00:23:13,591 --> 00:23:19,556
Speaker 1: at least at anime cons The policy is if you pay for a con you get everything that con has to offer for no more money.

365
00:23:19,877 --> 00:23:20,579
Speaker 1: Your admission is it?

366
00:23:21,328 --> 00:23:33,619
Speaker 1: Gaming cons Go halfway and all the old-style gaming con seems to be dying but old-style gaming cons You would pay some pittance to get in and then you paid four or five dollars for every game you wanted to participate in.

367
00:23:34,422 --> 00:23:37,620
Speaker 1: New gaming cons tend to just pay, you know, you pay like an anime con.

368
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:41,880
Speaker 0: I think what it is is that at an anime con?

369
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:55,559
Speaker 0: pretty much everyone there that you want to see and the panels you want to go to are Guests of the con which means the con Itself got those people to come and thus your membership fee pays for that.

370
00:23:55,981 --> 00:24:01,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, some of the things at the con were guests so you didn't pay for those panels separately.

371
00:24:02,021 --> 00:24:11,646
Speaker 0: However, I think that certain people who are charging for autographs or people charging to go to panels Those aren't con guests.

372
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:16,680
Speaker 0: Those are con exhibitors holding events and charging them for them separately.

373
00:24:17,224 --> 00:24:19,380
Speaker 0: So that's why that happens now.

374
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,186
Speaker 1: That's one thing I really want to talk about.

375
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:26,710
Speaker 1: that at any con I've ever been to if there's a guest and they're signing autographs They just sign autographs.

376
00:24:26,993 --> 00:24:33,361
Speaker 1: Maybe there's a line Maybe there's a limit but they just sign autographs and hang out and I think the people who are guests of the con were doing That.

377
00:24:33,742 --> 00:24:40,399
Speaker 1: but there were so many people here who were charging money for autographs and those people are here with some autograph company.

378
00:24:41,711 --> 00:24:48,600
Speaker 0: Yeah But still, you know the fact that you're coming there with an autograph company to sign autographs and you're not a con guest.

379
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,066
Speaker 0: It's like what the heck, you know, you're just.

380
00:24:50,367 --> 00:24:52,576
Speaker 1: it's like it's all just a big scheme to get money out of us.

381
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:56,190
Speaker 1: gert gerts I was gonna say nerd and geek and it all kind of went together.

382
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,274
Speaker 1: Yeah.

383
00:24:57,415 --> 00:25:00,213
Speaker 0: Oh, don't start a new word I don't know.

384
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:14,334
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've noticed people said in the forums but for all of you overseas listeners here in the u.s Nerd and geek seem to mean the opposite or have the opposite connotations that they do.

385
00:25:14,414 --> 00:25:17,382
Speaker 0: It seems like different people have Decided.

386
00:25:17,403 --> 00:25:18,367
Speaker 0: they mean different things.

387
00:25:18,408 --> 00:25:18,689
Speaker 0: Yep.

388
00:25:19,252 --> 00:25:21,904
Speaker 0: Nerd is bad and geek is good At least where we live.

389
00:25:22,266 --> 00:25:25,279
Speaker 1: geek is like what we are and nerd is like the comic book guy.

390
00:25:25,661 --> 00:25:28,368
Speaker 1: Yep, worst word ever.

391
00:25:28,388 --> 00:25:32,279
Speaker 0: a guy at a sci-fi convention dressed as a Star Trek dude is a nerd.

392
00:25:32,783 --> 00:25:33,429
Speaker 1: Well, it depends.

393
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:34,378
Speaker 1: he could be a cool guy.

394
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:44,071
Speaker 1: He's also talking about the relative merits of Star Trek technology versus Star Wars technology And he doesn't shut up when you're given the body language of dude, please go away.

395
00:25:44,092 --> 00:25:45,776
Speaker 1: The stench is overpowering me.

396
00:25:45,796 --> 00:25:47,200
Speaker 1: That is a nerd.

397
00:25:49,123 --> 00:25:51,219
Speaker 1: That is correct, that's what that is.

398
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:59,364
Speaker 0: Okay, so we got in the con now used to anime conventions which take up entire hotels or entire convention center our entire cities.

399
00:25:59,645 --> 00:26:13,380
Speaker 0: this one had panel rooms out in the hallway, which are actually pretty good and The con itself was one giant room I'd say Equal in size to the Otacon dealers room, but with a slightly higher ceiling

400
00:26:13,902 --> 00:26:17,853
Speaker 1: Yep, but also it only held is I think four or five thousand people.

401
00:26:17,893 --> 00:26:19,859
Speaker 1: was the fire capacity of that room was it?

402
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:26,680
Speaker 0: Because I ran by the sign and I saw it there I didn't look that you sure that wasn't for just half because it looked like they combined two rooms.

403
00:26:27,584 --> 00:26:30,056
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it looked like that was for the whole exhibit hall.

404
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:30,920
Speaker 0: Who knows?

405
00:26:31,761 --> 00:26:35,719
Speaker 0: Anyway, one half of the entire exhibit hall was dealers.

406
00:26:37,002 --> 00:26:41,072
Speaker 0: Now the dealer half was split into yet again two halves.

407
00:26:41,152 --> 00:26:48,920
Speaker 0: half of it was actual con dealers and half of it was the Publishers who had dealing booths which weren't used exclusively for dealing.

408
00:26:49,081 --> 00:27:00,699
Speaker 0: So like the Marvel in the DC booth and such we're down in the publisher area Next to the spike TV booth and the guys from comic book stores selling comic books were in the other half.

409
00:27:01,942 --> 00:27:08,503
Speaker 0: now the other half of the Convention Center was artists alley a gaming area and A food area.

410
00:27:08,784 --> 00:27:11,792
Speaker 1: Well, there's also the autograph area which was cordoned off.

411
00:27:12,033 --> 00:27:27,037
Speaker 1: Well, the autograph area was just this row of Little desks with people sitting at them giving autographs and then in front of those very long scary-looking lines Yep, where no one in those lines would interview with me, but I'll talk about that later.

412
00:27:27,057 --> 00:27:35,262
Speaker 0: All right So we started just by walking around, you know scoping out the lid of the land and then we made our way through artists alley Yep.

413
00:27:35,865 --> 00:27:39,800
Speaker 1: Now it was very different from an anime con artists alley.

414
00:27:40,682 --> 00:27:40,963
Speaker 1: It was.

415
00:27:41,304 --> 00:27:53,480
Speaker 1: it was people literally hawking their wares and I just I don't want to say that they were desperate But a lot of people were really trying to oversell themselves or wouldn't let me just walk by?

416
00:27:54,122 --> 00:27:55,407
Speaker 0: Yeah that I agree.

417
00:27:55,427 --> 00:28:00,006
Speaker 0: it seems like independent comic makers are You know?

418
00:28:00,067 --> 00:28:08,620
Speaker 0: because in an anime convention The artists alley is gonna have just some people making cute fan art or some people with a webcomic and they're usually just hanging out.

419
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:27,809
Speaker 0: Yeah This artists alley most of the people there were people who were artists and writers mostly artists of independent comic books which means they're trying to make their living or a portion of their living or They already spent a bunch of money in printing comic books that they need to sell to make a profit.

420
00:28:28,311 --> 00:28:35,795
Speaker 0: so they were really desperate to get your attention and Not so skilled at doing it in a way that wasn't off-putting.

421
00:28:36,196 --> 00:28:46,679
Speaker 1: after about three times I just stopped being polite which is very difficult for me to do and I just started brushing them off because they wouldn't leave me Alone, I'd want to look through their sketchbook and they just wouldn't stop bothering me.

422
00:28:47,122 --> 00:28:48,030
Speaker 1: Oh, you're gonna buy a comic.

423
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,340
Speaker 1: Oh if you buy this, I'll give you this for free.

424
00:28:50,742 --> 00:28:53,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like I go over to a guy's stuff, you know, cuz maybe I saw a cute drawing.

425
00:28:53,981 --> 00:28:57,547
Speaker 0: I'd go look at it and he'd be like, oh hey You wanna you wanna this here?

426
00:28:57,587 --> 00:28:58,110
Speaker 0: take some of this.

427
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:58,592
Speaker 0: take some of this.

428
00:28:58,672 --> 00:29:00,983
Speaker 0: Oh you want this is only one and I'm like All right, dude.

429
00:29:01,524 --> 00:29:01,866
Speaker 0: All right.

430
00:29:02,388 --> 00:29:03,752
Speaker 0: No, it wasn't everyone though.

431
00:29:03,913 --> 00:29:10,094
Speaker 0: Some of the guys are just you know, cool The thing was some of the people were extra quiet and wouldn't be sociable.

432
00:29:10,114 --> 00:29:13,170
Speaker 0: Like I'd be like, hey and they'd be like, oh, hey Yeah, it's like.

433
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,700
Speaker 0: it was two extremes.

434
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,724
Speaker 0: There wasn't anyone.

435
00:29:16,146 --> 00:29:19,740
Speaker 0: there are very few people who were normally sociable in the artists alley.

436
00:29:19,881 --> 00:29:20,423
Speaker 0: There were a couple.

437
00:29:20,684 --> 00:29:22,010
Speaker 0: I ran in but the most were not.

438
00:29:22,251 --> 00:29:25,948
Speaker 1: I would say there were three groups of people that were Normally sociable that I ran into.

439
00:29:26,551 --> 00:29:30,572
Speaker 1: one was at the studio and I interviewed him But the interview didn't come out so well cuz a lot of noise around.

440
00:29:31,276 --> 00:29:33,959
Speaker 1: the second one His comic is sitting right in front of me.

441
00:29:34,301 --> 00:29:35,446
Speaker 1: I'll talk about him in a minute.

442
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:38,740
Speaker 1: and the third one was the comic geek speak people who seemed kind of cool.

443
00:29:38,921 --> 00:29:39,101
Speaker 1: yeah,

444
00:29:39,121 --> 00:29:55,779
Speaker 0: the comic geek speak people, you know, I listen to their podcast which is pretty cool and It's weird that when you met them in person because I already I already knew who they work as they put their pictures online And their logo is actually little characters of themselves so you can figure out who's who and all that.

445
00:29:56,541 --> 00:30:05,887
Speaker 0: But the people who you know, like the cool comics in their group were less sociable than the people who are Ultra super trivia nerdy.

446
00:30:06,027 --> 00:30:09,559
Speaker 0: It was kind of backwards which I think is part of what makes their podcast so good.

447
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,250
Speaker 1: Now the second guy I talked about.

448
00:30:13,773 --> 00:30:18,410
Speaker 1: he was sitting there dressed Exactly the way the character in his comic looks.

449
00:30:19,072 --> 00:30:21,680
Speaker 0: I think he said he was the character from his comic.

450
00:30:21,761 --> 00:30:22,780
Speaker 0: He didn't give his real name.

451
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,620
Speaker 1: No, he didn't and I was looking at the comic and I don't see his real name anywhere prominent.

452
00:30:27,082 --> 00:30:28,948
Speaker 0: I think he wrote a comic about himself.

453
00:30:29,389 --> 00:30:32,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least his alter ego, which is common in comic books.

454
00:30:32,982 --> 00:30:35,880
Speaker 1: Now he really had the art of the sail mastered.

455
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,020
Speaker 1: He's sitting there and I walk over and I see what his comic is and I hold out my little microphone.

456
00:30:40,141 --> 00:30:41,107
Speaker 1: I'm like, can I interview you?

457
00:30:41,127 --> 00:30:42,214
Speaker 1: and he stopped?

458
00:30:42,234 --> 00:30:42,999
Speaker 1: He doesn't say a word.

459
00:30:43,422 --> 00:31:03,019
Speaker 1: he stands up and he puts on his coat and Then in full character, give me the following About a hero acts and dresses like a pimp.

460
00:31:08,363 --> 00:31:09,408
Speaker 0: You got a website or anything.

461
00:31:09,428 --> 00:31:14,668
Speaker 0: we can find our listeners that definitely it's called Black bastard.

462
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:19,526
Speaker 0: calm don't forget baby Black bastard.

463
00:31:19,988 --> 00:31:21,052
Speaker 1: he stayed in character.

464
00:31:21,092 --> 00:31:27,207
Speaker 1: as far as I can tell the whole con Yep, it's pretty much the best cosplay there.

465
00:31:27,227 --> 00:31:27,829
Speaker 0: Yeah.

466
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,554
Speaker 0: Well, it was of a character.

467
00:31:29,614 --> 00:31:34,128
Speaker 0: He created that's like if Who can I think of?

468
00:31:34,148 --> 00:31:37,408
Speaker 0: the utenna guy came to the con Dressed as toga.

469
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:39,100
Speaker 1: All right, that would be really scared.

470
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:49,420
Speaker 0: It would be really scary and just stood in an artist alley booth Selling you tenor DVDs and playing toga in character acting as if he was toga and he didn't eco her.

471
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,506
Speaker 0: Who's that now?

472
00:31:50,546 --> 00:31:53,240
Speaker 1: Not only was this guy awesome, but he didn't bother me because I was looking.

473
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:58,246
Speaker 1: I was like, I'm gonna come back and buy a comic or I'll be back later and Every other freaking artist.

474
00:31:58,366 --> 00:32:04,953
Speaker 1: if I said I'll come back around or I don't buy anything in my first pass They obviously thought I was lying and they tried to like.

475
00:32:04,973 --> 00:32:06,440
Speaker 1: they tried to bother me more.

476
00:32:06,882 --> 00:32:09,212
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz rim really doesn't buy anything on the first pass.

477
00:32:09,233 --> 00:32:10,820
Speaker 0: He hates carrying shit around the con.

478
00:32:11,001 --> 00:32:13,974
Speaker 0: Yeah, he'll go and figure out everything he's gonna buy.

479
00:32:14,276 --> 00:32:18,154
Speaker 0: then at the last minute He'll run around throwing money at everyone and then leave anime cons.

480
00:32:18,174 --> 00:32:18,737
Speaker 1: that works here.

481
00:32:18,797 --> 00:32:20,246
Speaker 1: No one believe me They're all bastards.

482
00:32:20,266 --> 00:32:22,260
Speaker 1: So I actually didn't go back cuz I was kind of pissed.

483
00:32:22,381 --> 00:32:27,032
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you're a bastard even if a comic looks, okay We're not gonna go for it unless you're a black bastard.

484
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:28,360
Speaker 1: cuz that guy was like, hey, that's cool.

485
00:32:28,948 --> 00:32:29,637
Speaker 1: And then I came back.

486
00:32:29,678 --> 00:32:29,860
Speaker 1: he's like.

487
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:35,426
Speaker 1: I knew you'd be back and I gave my three dollars and I got my signed copy of black bastard number one Black bastard.

488
00:32:35,446 --> 00:32:36,510
Speaker 0: we gotta read that comics.

489
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:38,157
Speaker 1: I'll review it next week.

490
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:39,444
Speaker 0: All right I got some other.

491
00:32:39,484 --> 00:32:44,199
Speaker 0: I can read some other comics to review next week - all right We'll have a little comic week for once.

492
00:32:44,942 --> 00:32:51,440
Speaker 1: Now at this point the two Scots because we went with our good friend Scott Johnson who is the master of finding deals at conventions.

493
00:32:52,046 --> 00:32:52,692
Speaker 0: But you know what?

494
00:32:52,732 --> 00:32:53,156
Speaker 0: He likes.

495
00:32:54,242 --> 00:32:55,440
Speaker 1: I like crap.

496
00:32:56,801 --> 00:32:58,459
Speaker 0: That's why he doesn't have to spend a lot of money.

497
00:32:59,402 --> 00:33:08,828
Speaker 1: The back story there is that we were winding down We were about to leave for the beach and I ran up behind him and cornered him and started just interviewing him even though we're friends with a little recording bit.

498
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:19,408
Speaker 1: and he said that in the middle of talking about how he gets all the good deals and Then he said ah crap now you're gonna play that on your show like every day for the next 20 years and you know That's right.

499
00:33:19,428 --> 00:33:19,489
Speaker 1: Yep.

500
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:19,913
Speaker 1: Yep

501
00:33:23,453 --> 00:33:40,918
Speaker 0: I Like crap No, but basically after I we had perused artists alley The only thing left for us to do at the con since he weren't interested in any of the panels That were at least none of the ones that were running while we were there Was to walk around the dealers room and make sure there wasn't anything insanely cheap and worth buying.

502
00:33:41,239 --> 00:33:44,494
Speaker 1: now The two Scots did that while I went off for other erstwhile pursuits.

503
00:33:44,715 --> 00:33:48,659
Speaker 1: So I like doing in such Yeah, so I'll let him talk about his dealing experience first.

504
00:33:48,921 --> 00:34:15,320
Speaker 0: Well, it seems to me like most of the people running around buying stuff were They had a list of comics that they wanted because they were collectors and they were looking, you know they had the list that they in their hand and they would look through bins for anything on that list and pull it out and Make a pile and then once they had a pile big enough from one dealer They would pay for it and go to the next dealer trying to fill up their whole list Starting with the cheapest stuff and going to the expensive stuff.

505
00:34:16,003 --> 00:34:19,998
Speaker 1: I saw dudes walking around with like a couple hundred comics in a big old sack.

506
00:34:20,279 --> 00:34:22,868
Speaker 0: Yep Of course, there was a lack of bags.

507
00:34:23,049 --> 00:34:26,360
Speaker 0: Someone should have called up bandai who always has the good Otacon bags.

508
00:34:26,742 --> 00:34:32,286
Speaker 0: I mean they had Sony bags, but they disappeared right away and They weren't even really that big.

509
00:34:32,306 --> 00:34:34,034
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've still got my bandai bag.

510
00:34:34,054 --> 00:34:38,800
Speaker 1: That thing is really high quality Yeah, and the con bag was really crappy and mine broke.

511
00:34:39,155 --> 00:34:42,353
Speaker 0: Yeah Someone needs some some better bags like the nice vis bags.

512
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:45,632
Speaker 0: vis always has awesome bags With the canvas and everything.

513
00:34:45,672 --> 00:34:46,540
Speaker 0: I have two vis bags.

514
00:34:49,273 --> 00:34:51,206
Speaker 0: anyway, I Was looking for one comic.

515
00:34:51,467 --> 00:34:51,788
Speaker 1: what that?

516
00:34:51,808 --> 00:34:52,270
Speaker 1: spider-man 2099?

517
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:56,246
Speaker 0: spider-man 2099 number 36 but I bought that.

518
00:34:56,648 --> 00:35:05,250
Speaker 0: I bought spider-man 2099 when I was a kid and I got one through 34 or 35 something like that.

519
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:07,777
Speaker 0: and that yeah one through 35 I got when I was a kid.

520
00:35:08,479 --> 00:35:16,293
Speaker 0: then Recently because I started buying comics again I found an eBay auction and I acquired 37 through the end.

521
00:35:16,695 --> 00:35:18,482
Speaker 0: that leaves out number 36.

522
00:35:18,482 --> 00:35:20,634
Speaker 1: Apparently it's impossible to find on eBay.

523
00:35:20,694 --> 00:35:21,780
Speaker 0: It's five bucks.

524
00:35:21,941 --> 00:35:31,380
Speaker 0: I could get it for like a lot of money But it's not worth paying because if I found it at a con it would cost me 25 cents or 10 cents or 10 cents, which I'll talk about too.

525
00:35:31,561 --> 00:35:37,430
Speaker 0: So the good part of the con there are three things I was looking at 25 cent comic books.

526
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:46,285
Speaker 0: 50 cent comic books Occasionally $1 comic books, but only you know super rarely and Half off trades.

527
00:35:46,585 --> 00:35:47,989
Speaker 0: half off trades are awesome.

528
00:35:48,391 --> 00:35:49,654
Speaker 0: That's what Scott Johnson loaded up.

529
00:35:49,694 --> 00:35:54,633
Speaker 0: He bought a pile ant-man Essential ant-man 50% off.

530
00:35:54,713 --> 00:36:01,240
Speaker 1: as he buys it Now funnily enough ant-man came up in conversation like 15 times that weekend.

531
00:36:01,763 --> 00:36:04,680
Speaker 0: He just because he read the ant-man was the first comic he read.

532
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:08,778
Speaker 0: You know what are when he had read a different comic in the car when that would have come up.

533
00:36:08,859 --> 00:36:13,439
Speaker 1: when all you Have is a trade of ant-man Every problem looks like an ant.

534
00:36:16,403 --> 00:36:25,716
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing was is that You know there weren't for all the the fact that the only thing for me to do with the con was look at cheap-ass comics.

535
00:36:26,278 --> 00:36:30,669
Speaker 0: only maybe Five or six of the dealers had cheap-ass comics.

536
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:34,680
Speaker 1: Most of them had a million expensive Silver Age comics like on a wall.

537
00:36:34,982 --> 00:36:46,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, most like there were three or four dealers Exclusively selling old expensive comics Which I wanted nothing to do with because they're terrible and only really collectors care about them because reading them is painful.

538
00:36:46,741 --> 00:36:52,340
Speaker 0: And if you there are good ones to read they've been reprinted in trade paperback since and I can go get them for half off.

539
00:36:53,760 --> 00:37:05,209
Speaker 0: Also, there were guys selling scary collector stuff like comics sealed in hard plastic things with like Grade numbers on them telling you how mint they are.

540
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:09,400
Speaker 1: there was that auction service that was selling collectible auction services.

541
00:37:10,401 --> 00:37:11,386
Speaker 1: Wow, there was those.

542
00:37:11,406 --> 00:37:14,340
Speaker 1: there were the group of people selling a collectible comic insurance.

543
00:37:15,073 --> 00:37:15,480
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

544
00:37:15,823 --> 00:37:22,080
Speaker 0: So if you have a large comic collection They would sell you insurance in case your comic collection was destroyed in a flood or something.

545
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,144
Speaker 1: I didn't really talk to them.

546
00:37:23,205 --> 00:37:29,515
Speaker 1: But based on what I saw in my brief watching of them talk to people I'm pretty sure it was some sort of scam or they.

547
00:37:29,555 --> 00:37:30,360
Speaker 0: it was such a scam.

548
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,927
Speaker 0: These people didn't even look like comic people.

549
00:37:31,967 --> 00:37:33,674
Speaker 0: They were two insurance salesman ladies.

550
00:37:33,734 --> 00:37:37,769
Speaker 0: Yeah, there were People selling t-shirts nerdy t-shirts.

551
00:37:37,809 --> 00:37:38,351
Speaker 0: That was cool.

552
00:37:38,492 --> 00:37:40,380
Speaker 0: One guy had every nerdy t-shirt in existence.

553
00:37:41,121 --> 00:37:43,992
Speaker 0: I wasn't about to buy anything from him because he was hideously overpriced.

554
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:44,393
Speaker 0: how much worse.

555
00:37:44,413 --> 00:37:44,674
Speaker 0: hoodies.

556
00:37:45,016 --> 00:37:49,087
Speaker 1: Oh God, they were $45 $45 hoodie.

557
00:37:49,207 --> 00:37:51,740
Speaker 0: forget it, but he did have a lot of wide selections.

558
00:37:51,961 --> 00:37:56,805
Speaker 1: However, you can get all that stuff at an anime con or you know on the internet internet Yeah for much cheaper.

559
00:37:57,428 --> 00:38:00,380
Speaker 0: and there was plenty of guys selling overpriced toys.

560
00:38:00,741 --> 00:38:04,753
Speaker 0: However, there were some gems such as the bin of $5 GI Joe's.

561
00:38:07,588 --> 00:38:08,299
Speaker 0: That was pretty good.

562
00:38:08,406 --> 00:38:18,460
Speaker 0: Yeah The guy basically had old GI Joe toys with all the accessories and little plastic bags and you could root through the bin Pick out any plastic bag you wanted and it was a set price of a few bucks.

563
00:38:18,883 --> 00:38:25,540
Speaker 1: One guy had in the middle of all this crack He had like this pile of crap laying somewhere and one item was the awesome.

564
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,025
Speaker 1: I'm gonna die.

Speaker 1: Oh box set awesome.

Speaker 1: and he didn't know like.

568
00:38:30,072 --> 00:38:31,900
Speaker 1: he was like, ah, there was no price on it.

569
00:38:32,322 --> 00:38:33,286
Speaker 1: So I offered him 40 bucks.

570
00:38:33,306 --> 00:38:34,612
Speaker 1: He said no and then I walked away.

00:38:34,632 --> 00:38:37,926
Speaker 0: Yeah Wow 40 bucks He get for less than that online 30.

572
00:38:37,926 --> 00:38:39,814
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably 30 is a good price for that.

573
00:38:39,955 --> 00:38:43,812
Speaker 0: That's that's about the right price I'd say at least for the box of the little DVDs.

574
00:38:43,892 --> 00:38:45,519
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's the little DVD, but yeah the new.

577
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:55,156
Speaker 0: Yeah, all the good stuff to be found at this con were in the boxes under the tables.

578
00:38:55,196 --> 00:39:00,273
Speaker 0: you get on your hands and knees And you dig through boxes and you dig through messes to find shit.

579
00:39:00,694 --> 00:39:02,560
Speaker 0: The thing is I'm running out of patience.

580
00:39:03,562 --> 00:39:08,219
Speaker 0: I went over and there were plenty of guys at 25 cent bins and plenty of people looking through them.

581
00:39:08,801 --> 00:39:12,552
Speaker 0: Some people had their 25 cent bins in alphabetical order.

582
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:17,640
Speaker 0: for those I could just go straight to the parts I cared about and the rest whatever.

583
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:28,438
Speaker 0: Some of the guys had things completely unsorted, you know, what I looked through Cursor early, but it wasn't worth my time to look through every single goddamn comic in there.

584
00:39:28,839 --> 00:39:30,250
Speaker 0: the comic I wanted might have been in there.

585
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,339
Speaker 0: It wasn't worth my time.

586
00:39:31,822 --> 00:39:36,158
Speaker 0: I could have made more money working a minimum wage job than spending an hour to buy a 25 cent comic.

587
00:39:38,861 --> 00:39:45,532
Speaker 0: But yeah other than that the dealing and the artists Ally and talking to a couple people There was nothing else to do.

588
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:49,020
Speaker 1: So we went to the beach Yep, and the beach was much more enjoyable.

589
00:39:49,372 --> 00:39:55,640
Speaker 1: Yeah I can safely say that I am never returning to any comic convention that cost money to get into.

590
00:39:56,396 --> 00:40:05,649
Speaker 0: Yeah the way I see it is that if a comic an anime convention or gaming convention is a big party with lots of Activities that will occupy you throughout a weekend.

591
00:40:06,151 --> 00:40:08,500
Speaker 0: And so you want to go to those no matter what they cost.

592
00:40:09,441 --> 00:40:14,920
Speaker 0: And as long as you know, well not no matter what they cost as long as the cost is proportional to the party.

593
00:40:15,141 --> 00:40:20,568
Speaker 1: Well considering that I would pay about a hundred and fifty dollars just off the top of my head go to Otacon I think that's a good deal.

594
00:40:20,589 --> 00:40:30,300
Speaker 0: Yep, a comic-con at least one like this seems to be less of a party and more of a temporary ultra giant comic book store.

595
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:43,134
Speaker 0: which means if you're gonna pay the entry fee and you're not interested in a lot of the panels like us because well, most of the panels are Regardless of whether we found them interesting or not.

596
00:40:43,194 --> 00:40:46,646
Speaker 0: They were genuinely Uninteresting industry panels.

597
00:40:46,927 --> 00:40:53,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, or they don't go to those types of panels at anime con Or they cost a lot of extra money and you had to stand in line.

598
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm sure going to see Kevin Smith would have been interesting But you know what?

599
00:40:56,060 --> 00:41:03,940
Speaker 0: It wasn't worth spending an entire weekend of rushing around Philadelphia at the crack-ass of dawn getting in lines paying extra money for tickets.

600
00:41:04,542 --> 00:41:05,405
Speaker 0: It's just not worth it.

601
00:41:05,927 --> 00:41:07,874
Speaker 0: If it was just walk in and see Kevin Smith.

602
00:41:07,914 --> 00:41:09,500
Speaker 0: I would have been like, yeah, sure fine cool.

603
00:41:09,882 --> 00:41:14,611
Speaker 0: He'd probably entertain me for a good hour or so Yeah, but it wasn't worth the effort required.

604
00:41:14,732 --> 00:41:16,320
Speaker 0: only super nerds would go to that effort.

605
00:41:16,461 --> 00:41:19,533
Speaker 0: So let them have their fun be my guest now.

606
00:41:19,614 --> 00:41:23,408
Speaker 1: while the two Scots were doing all this I was doing what I do at every convention I go to.

607
00:41:23,428 --> 00:41:30,498
Speaker 1: I was walking around trying to interview people about their con experience and something happened that has never happened to me before.

608
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:37,360
Speaker 1: and The more I tried to talk to people and interview people the more I realized that I was in a strange and foreign land.

609
00:41:38,481 --> 00:41:58,459
Speaker 1: Now for the first thing the first person I asked like hey you want to be interviewed for a blah blah blah podcast Which yeah the same shtick I do at every time I interview someone and the guy backed off and he's like, uh and he seemed really surprised that I talked to him like he wasn't sure I was talking to him and Then he got really uncomfortable and told me no, he didn't want to talk to me.

610
00:41:59,752 --> 00:42:01,385
Speaker 1: All right I figured I just picked some fanboy.

611
00:42:01,747 --> 00:42:05,240
Speaker 1: the next three people I tried to interview reacted in almost the same way.

612
00:42:05,602 --> 00:42:09,706
Speaker 1: Everyone refused an interview like they didn't want to have anything to do with me They didn't want to talk to me.

613
00:42:09,766 --> 00:42:12,739
Speaker 1: They wanted me to leave them alone so they could continue about whatever business they had.

614
00:42:13,301 --> 00:42:22,239
Speaker 1: hmm, I finally found two cool guys who look like they're having a good time and I interviewed them and I'll play a little segment from that at the end of this because it's not really relevant now.

615
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:24,749
Speaker 1: But I just asked him, you know why they're here.

616
00:42:24,769 --> 00:42:26,476
Speaker 1: They really like Silver Age comics.

617
00:42:26,516 --> 00:42:28,608
Speaker 1: They don't like anime They don't like video games.

618
00:42:28,829 --> 00:42:30,599
Speaker 1: They only like Silver Age comics.

619
00:42:31,661 --> 00:42:35,600
Speaker 0: Well one day there are only so many Silver Age comics, aren't you gonna run out of those one day?

620
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,847
Speaker 1: You know, I didn't think to ask him that I wish I would have.

621
00:42:38,409 --> 00:42:45,484
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean it's like I only like beer from 1970 through 1975.

622
00:42:45,484 --> 00:42:47,791
Speaker 0: Well, eventually it's gonna all get drunk, isn't it?

623
00:42:48,272 --> 00:42:50,138
Speaker 0: Yeah, then you'll have nothing left to like.

624
00:42:50,278 --> 00:42:50,800
Speaker 1: kill yourself.

625
00:42:51,382 --> 00:42:55,037
Speaker 0: It's like I. my only hobby is collecting model trains made in the 80s.

626
00:42:55,761 --> 00:42:57,833
Speaker 0: There are only so many model trains made in the 80s.

627
00:42:57,874 --> 00:42:58,920
Speaker 0: Eventually you'll have them all.

628
00:43:00,001 --> 00:43:06,160
Speaker 1: Now some people would interview with me But either they didn't want me to record it like they were afraid of my little microphone.

629
00:43:06,803 --> 00:43:13,485
Speaker 1: So I got to talk to him a little bit and they all basically said the same thing that these Comic guys I actually did interview said, you know Oh, I'm here for the deals.

630
00:43:13,565 --> 00:43:15,453
Speaker 1: or oh I can get comics for cheap.

631
00:43:15,513 --> 00:43:18,749
Speaker 1: or oh I can see the famous people I like and get him to sign my blah blah blah.

632
00:43:19,171 --> 00:43:20,879
Speaker 1: Those are really the only answers people gave me.

633
00:43:21,423 --> 00:43:24,865
Speaker 0: Yeah, as far as signing things goes I'm really kind of indifferent.

634
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:29,540
Speaker 0: the guy who made who writes and draws Mouse Guard was there which is awesome.

635
00:43:29,781 --> 00:43:30,225
Speaker 1: He's which.

636
00:43:30,325 --> 00:43:32,160
Speaker 0: Mouse Guard is an awesome freaking comic.

637
00:43:32,261 --> 00:43:35,560
Speaker 0: If you don't know go to this comic store near you and buy Mouse Guard.

638
00:43:35,942 --> 00:43:36,506
Speaker 0: It doesn't look.

639
00:43:36,546 --> 00:43:40,919
Speaker 0: it's not the same size and shape as a normal comic But it's worth every penny if you like.

640
00:43:41,221 --> 00:43:53,180
Speaker 0: I don't know red wall or anything involving funny because I don't like red wall anything involving anthropomorphic animals living out cool things or any sort of medieval questing intrigue stories.

641
00:43:53,761 --> 00:43:58,354
Speaker 1: The fact that they are mice is irrelevant to the story, but it's directly relevant to the atmosphere.

642
00:43:58,374 --> 00:43:59,296
Speaker 0: That's correct.

643
00:43:59,978 --> 00:44:00,600
Speaker 1: It's just really cool.

644
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:05,496
Speaker 0: We'll review it where the enemy because the enemies aren't dragons like they are in a human story.

645
00:44:05,537 --> 00:44:08,619
Speaker 0: They're snakes and crabs Yeah, and other mice, of course.

646
00:44:09,482 --> 00:44:13,180
Speaker 0: But anyway, the guy was there who I didn't expect and I was like, whoa, dude, you're awesome.

647
00:44:13,321 --> 00:44:14,126
Speaker 0: And then I bought his.

648
00:44:14,368 --> 00:44:16,060
Speaker 0: you know, I already had number one at home.

649
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,639
Speaker 0: So I bought two and three which are the only ones out so far.

650
00:44:19,163 --> 00:44:21,699
Speaker 0: I asked him if there was gonna be a trade and he said yes.

651
00:44:22,161 --> 00:44:27,660
Speaker 0: So all of you who like to save money just wait around for the mouse guard trade to come out and get all over that.

652
00:44:28,402 --> 00:44:30,851
Speaker 0: I think it's gonna be a bunch of separate miniseries.

653
00:44:30,911 --> 00:44:33,460
Speaker 0: So there might be a trade for each miniseries.

654
00:44:33,862 --> 00:44:43,600
Speaker 0: so I'll probably just finish off the first miniseries and get the trades for the rest of them, but You know, I bought two and three off of them, you know, and I was complimenting how awesome he was and everything.

655
00:44:43,701 --> 00:44:52,340
Speaker 0: He seemed like he wasn't talking so much But I found out later if when the CGS guys interviewed him for real that is because he lost his voice from talking so much.

656
00:44:53,562 --> 00:44:54,245
Speaker 1: All right, that's cool.

657
00:44:54,406 --> 00:44:59,267
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know, then he's like signing the issues and I'm like I don't really care if you sign it or not.

658
00:44:59,588 --> 00:45:00,311
Speaker 0: I just want to read it.

659
00:45:00,793 --> 00:45:04,847
Speaker 0: Yeah, but other comic nerds are like Oh, holy collectible increasing value.

660
00:45:04,887 --> 00:45:09,742
Speaker 1: Yeah, they stood in line for like 45 minutes to get someone to sign something and to pay for the Privilege of it.

661
00:45:10,023 --> 00:45:10,464
Speaker 0: Yeah.

662
00:45:10,765 --> 00:45:12,651
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, the guy who does black bastard.

663
00:45:13,273 --> 00:45:15,420
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna assume his name is black bastard.

664
00:45:15,601 --> 00:45:17,287
Speaker 0: I'm sure that's what he would like you to call him.

665
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:20,559
Speaker 1: He just signed it without even saying a word other than oh, yeah.

666
00:45:23,955 --> 00:45:36,020
Speaker 1: Now Finally, I ran into some people who were cool and they were excited to interview with me and one of them was dressed up as a Jedi and Then later later another one walked up and she was dressed as Sailor V from Sailor Moon.

667
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:39,588
Speaker 0: Now you might wonder transformation noise, but I can't.

668
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:41,292
Speaker 1: you might wonder why.

669
00:45:41,373 --> 00:45:50,917
Speaker 1: you know, someone would be dressed up as an anime character and It turns out that these people are anime con fans and they'd never been to a comic convention before.

670
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:51,940
Speaker 1: and this is their first one.

671
00:45:52,022 --> 00:45:55,894
Speaker 1: and well Why do you guys go to conventions?

672
00:45:55,934 --> 00:45:56,840
Speaker 1: Like what is the appeal?

673
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:03,020
Speaker 1: Mostly to dress up and be a celebrity and have everybody want to take their picture with you outstanding.

674
00:46:04,202 --> 00:46:07,898
Speaker 1: If you stand still long enough some guy will come up and ask to interview you for a radio show.

675
00:46:08,884 --> 00:46:11,259
Speaker 1: And while I'm here it appears that Sailor V has arrived.

676
00:46:12,765 --> 00:46:20,693
Speaker 1: I have seen all 200 episodes of Sailor Moon including Amichandarotsukor So you're obviously anime fan.

677
00:46:20,754 --> 00:46:24,630
Speaker 1: in addition to So what anime con do you go to?

678
00:46:24,651 --> 00:46:26,380
Speaker 1: What conventions in general do you go to every year?

679
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:30,803
Speaker 0: I go to Otakon and Kasakon every year and sometimes Anime USA All right.

680
00:46:30,823 --> 00:46:34,077
Speaker 1: So here's a nice broad-based question real broad you cosplay?

681
00:46:34,137 --> 00:46:34,579
Speaker 1: obviously.

682
00:46:36,605 --> 00:46:37,753
Speaker 1: Why very very open-ended?

683
00:46:37,874 --> 00:46:38,840
Speaker 1: Why do you cosplay?

684
00:46:40,205 --> 00:46:43,940
Speaker 1: I love sewing and I really like attention.

685
00:46:44,822 --> 00:46:48,130
Speaker 1: All right, there's another broad question.

686
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:52,420
Speaker 1: obviously this is a comic convention which is often very different from an anime convention.

687
00:46:52,903 --> 00:46:54,491
Speaker 1: Do you like one more than the other?

688
00:46:54,552 --> 00:46:54,692
Speaker 1: like?

689
00:46:54,733 --> 00:46:55,778
Speaker 1: what's the difference between the two?

690
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,626
Speaker 0: Actually my first comic convention ever.

691
00:46:58,646 --> 00:47:00,873
Speaker 0: so I'm still forming my opinion.

692
00:47:00,893 --> 00:47:03,843
Speaker 1: I Dragged her to it.

693
00:47:04,586 --> 00:47:05,750
Speaker 1: That would be my boyfriend.

694
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:08,640
Speaker 1: Um, it's a lot less people cosplay here.

695
00:47:08,762 --> 00:47:09,540
Speaker 1: It's very interesting.

696
00:47:10,723 --> 00:47:14,325
Speaker 1: I'm kind of still getting used to it Now after I turn the mic off.

697
00:47:14,345 --> 00:47:23,020
Speaker 1: they talked a little bit more and their basic impression of comic conventions Is that everyone's kind of scary and they're kind of boring and there's nothing to do and no one cosplays.

698
00:47:23,681 --> 00:47:31,892
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do think that the general comic-con atmosphere is one of Isolation, I mean it comes down to a few things.

699
00:47:31,953 --> 00:47:33,660
Speaker 0: I talked already about how the name tags.

700
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:34,968
Speaker 0: You don't even put your name on them.

701
00:47:34,988 --> 00:47:43,823
Speaker 0: So they're not expecting you to be social - there really aren't any group activities at the con other than the small gaming area Everything to do.

702
00:47:43,863 --> 00:47:50,743
Speaker 1: there is an individual thing and the gaming area wasn't just free gaming like go set up a game and play it Or here's some games to play.

703
00:47:51,245 --> 00:47:54,414
Speaker 1: It was definitely a. we're plugging this set of games.

704
00:47:54,495 --> 00:47:56,019
Speaker 1: Come here and play them with us.

705
00:47:56,342 --> 00:47:58,163
Speaker 0: It was watsy Lots.

706
00:47:58,183 --> 00:48:00,693
Speaker 0: he was all over it, you know, you know an anime concept.

707
00:48:00,733 --> 00:48:05,412
Speaker 0: plenty of solitary things to do But they also have plenty of group things to do, you know.

708
00:48:05,493 --> 00:48:07,200
Speaker 0: cosplay is a group activity.

709
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:11,574
Speaker 0: There's always role-playing at an anime con.

710
00:48:11,715 --> 00:48:12,860
Speaker 0: That's a group activity.

711
00:48:12,962 --> 00:48:21,300
Speaker 0: You know There's all sorts of group things going down at anime cons and there just weren't any group things at the comic-con whatsoever.

712
00:48:22,021 --> 00:48:27,100
Speaker 0: Also, I'd like to point out is that anime is a group activity.

713
00:48:27,764 --> 00:48:33,813
Speaker 0: You sit together with people and enjoy Watching animated shows in a group.

714
00:48:34,074 --> 00:48:35,340
Speaker 0: You don't do it all alone.

715
00:48:35,541 --> 00:48:39,359
Speaker 0: Well, some people do it all in your room, but it's mostly you do it together.

716
00:48:39,901 --> 00:48:42,648
Speaker 0: Reading comics is a personal thing.

717
00:48:42,688 --> 00:48:43,951
Speaker 0: You sit down alone.

718
00:48:43,971 --> 00:48:45,154
Speaker 0: You comic-booking you.

719
00:48:45,174 --> 00:48:47,640
Speaker 0: you don't sit around with a group of people reading comics.

720
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:56,647
Speaker 1: now you I mean you can but it's not the same like if you're watching an anime with ten people, you know, like that host mojo and Something crazy happens.

721
00:48:56,708 --> 00:48:58,760
Speaker 1: Everyone goes who yells and screams and laughs.

722
00:48:59,041 --> 00:48:59,923
Speaker 1: That's a group thing.

723
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:05,520
Speaker 1: If you're all reading comics together, you're not going to all have the same experience together and yell and scream together.

724
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:07,866
Speaker 0: Yeah I think it's it's not just.

725
00:49:08,588 --> 00:49:19,920
Speaker 0: I think that the resulting attitudes of the people in the particular geekeries are Mostly a result of the nature of the geekeries themselves and it's not something people think about a lot.

726
00:49:20,702 --> 00:49:24,009
Speaker 1: Also that just the it's probably related but just the culture.

727
00:49:24,029 --> 00:49:28,360
Speaker 1: it seems that anime and gaming conventions are wider nets.

728
00:49:28,881 --> 00:49:31,340
Speaker 1: I mean everyone who goes to an anime con for the most part likes anime.

729
00:49:31,942 --> 00:49:36,740
Speaker 1: Everyone who goes to a gaming con for the most part likes gaming and everyone goes to a comic-con for the most part likes comics.

730
00:49:37,702 --> 00:49:44,939
Speaker 1: Most of the people who went to the comic-con Didn't like anime or just didn't watch anime or had no interest in anime or gaming for that matter.

731
00:49:45,702 --> 00:49:50,060
Speaker 1: But most of the people who went to the gaming con like anime and most of the people went to the anime cons like gaming.

732
00:49:50,565 --> 00:49:55,771
Speaker 0: Yeah, or at least there's a lot more Crossover at the gaming and anime cons into other geekeries.

733
00:49:55,791 --> 00:49:58,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the crossover doesn't exist like a gaming con.

734
00:49:59,122 --> 00:50:04,052
Speaker 0: there is significant sci-fi and fantasy novel type stuff.

735
00:50:04,093 --> 00:50:06,365
Speaker 0: crossover in anime.

736
00:50:06,446 --> 00:50:12,500
Speaker 0: video gaming heavy crossover ring at a board gaming con and Anime is slightly less crossover ring, but still plenty.

737
00:50:12,813 --> 00:50:14,505
Speaker 1: Yeah But it's like the Venn diagram.

738
00:50:14,585 --> 00:50:19,700
Speaker 1: of all the geekeries comics are really kind of mostly not overlapping with anything.

739
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:27,620
Speaker 0: Scott's Hypothesis for why this is so is that while all geekeries are expensive, you know board games are cheap.

740
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:28,522
Speaker 1: Hypothesis.

741
00:50:28,803 --> 00:50:30,127
Speaker 0: if you it's a good hypothesis.

742
00:50:30,207 --> 00:50:30,448
Speaker 1: I know.

743
00:50:30,488 --> 00:50:38,092
Speaker 0: I just wanted to say that anime is not a cheap hobby But comics with their collector mentality.

744
00:50:38,233 --> 00:50:41,626
Speaker 0: I by far the most expensive men Geekery there is.

745
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:54,231
Speaker 0: yet if you're a comic nerd you're spending money Every single week on Wednesday when new comics come out anime fans buy DVD now and then board game guys Buy a bunch of games every few months.

746
00:50:54,572 --> 00:51:09,800
Speaker 0: comic guys are consistently spending money and time week after week on their geekery thus to the exclusion of other geekeries and That is why there is less crossover with the comic geeks.

747
00:51:10,181 --> 00:51:21,616
Speaker 1: That's why Scott thinks there is less crossover with the comic geeks now very relevant to this in the spirit of anime world order Which I'm more and more a fan of ever since I met them way back at Katsu khan.

748
00:51:21,636 --> 00:51:24,173
Speaker 1: I Did my own search for the truth?

749
00:51:24,697 --> 00:51:35,776
Speaker 1: Oh, I Tried to find out the truth behind the difference in anime convention goers Versus comic convention goers and I went around an amazement way back and I didn't.

750
00:51:35,897 --> 00:51:36,900
Speaker 1: I got all these interviews.

751
00:51:37,304 --> 00:51:41,767
Speaker 1: I asked people one simple question Why do you go to conventions?

752
00:51:42,108 --> 00:51:42,970
Speaker 1: What is the appeal?

753
00:51:43,091 --> 00:51:43,853
Speaker 1: What is the draw?

754
00:51:44,174 --> 00:51:45,217
Speaker 1: Why are you here now?

755
00:51:46,341 --> 00:51:47,266
Speaker 1: Here's what they answered.

756
00:51:47,830 --> 00:52:04,458
Speaker 1: Let's see all the cosplayers mostly And I love everyone such a door to be with my people All the above Hot guys in costumes and I fit in All the above.

757
00:52:06,565 --> 00:52:07,619
Speaker 1: It's a gathering of geeks.

758
00:52:07,741 --> 00:52:10,360
Speaker 1: It's where we all come and we're with our own kind.

759
00:52:10,683 --> 00:52:20,534
Speaker 1: It's like salmon go upstream Geeks come to cons And there's other geeks and the geekness, you know, reaches some new levels Now very typical very broad-based.

760
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:23,466
Speaker 1: They seem very Very thoughtful answers.

761
00:52:23,486 --> 00:52:25,432
Speaker 1: They seem like they really enjoy what they do.

762
00:52:25,753 --> 00:52:27,820
Speaker 1: They have a lot of very well other than hot guys.

763
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,371
Speaker 1: They have many varied reasons for being there hot guys.

764
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:32,159
Speaker 1: It's definitely a social thing.

765
00:52:33,709 --> 00:52:33,875
Speaker 1: now.

766
00:52:34,781 --> 00:52:35,565
Speaker 1: Consider this.

767
00:52:36,048 --> 00:52:38,080
Speaker 1: this was recorded at Philly wizard world.

768
00:52:38,422 --> 00:52:48,880
Speaker 1: This is the only interview I got with someone that was intelligible Because almost everyone who actually would interview with me was shy or a low talker or mumbled or something and the interview is just worthless.

769
00:52:49,522 --> 00:52:50,827
Speaker 1: This is a real broad question.

770
00:52:50,847 --> 00:52:52,574
Speaker 1: But why do you go to these conventions?

771
00:52:52,634 --> 00:52:53,718
Speaker 0: What's the appeal?

772
00:52:53,758 --> 00:52:54,220
Speaker 0: What's the draw?

773
00:52:54,802 --> 00:52:55,224
Speaker 0: The joys?

774
00:52:55,244 --> 00:52:58,840
Speaker 0: you can get books cheaper and what you can do are if you buy them at the stand.

775
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,265
Speaker 1: Yeah, big dealers room.

776
00:53:01,666 --> 00:53:02,168
Speaker 0: Yep.

777
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:09,692
Speaker 0: So I think my final assessment is that if Scott were to go to comic cons in the future.

778
00:53:10,093 --> 00:53:15,275
Speaker 0: They would have to either be a Scott is a guest and thus it's everything's free.

779
00:53:15,335 --> 00:53:18,581
Speaker 0: and why not go be Everything's?

780
00:53:19,063 --> 00:53:24,180
Speaker 0: it doesn't cost anything to get in and I'm not I don't have to travel out of my way to get there.

781
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:25,606
Speaker 0: And thus why not go?

782
00:53:25,626 --> 00:53:28,578
Speaker 0: and you know, maybe there's a chance of finding a good deal.

783
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:33,354
Speaker 0: Or see it's some point a couple years from now.

784
00:53:33,535 --> 00:53:34,278
Speaker 0: I'm going well.

785
00:53:34,398 --> 00:53:47,460
Speaker 0: starting now I'm going to start making a list of any old comic I want that I can't get or that should be in a 25-cent bin and if that list ever gets super long perhaps a couple years from now I will go to a car.

786
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,568
Speaker 0: I got an idea and get all the time.

787
00:53:49,588 --> 00:53:54,425
Speaker 1: we could either provide this as a service and make money or Find people to do it.

788
00:53:54,485 --> 00:53:54,886
Speaker 1: for us.

789
00:53:55,629 --> 00:53:58,480
Speaker 1: have people who will stand outside comic conventions.

790
00:53:58,984 --> 00:54:00,699
Speaker 1: You give them a list of all the things you want.

791
00:54:01,342 --> 00:54:06,500
Speaker 1: Once they have a bunch of lists they go in search the bargain bins buy it all bring it back for a small markup.

792
00:54:07,801 --> 00:54:09,974
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's already a 25 cent bin.

793
00:54:10,134 --> 00:54:11,120
Speaker 0: any kind of markup?

794
00:54:11,361 --> 00:54:14,116
Speaker 1: Well, the markup is you pay him five bucks for all of their time.

795
00:54:14,156 --> 00:54:14,679
Speaker 0: There you go.

796
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:15,843
Speaker 0: That's what it.

797
00:54:15,904 --> 00:54:18,392
Speaker 0: you know, it's how long I'm talking about.

798
00:54:18,412 --> 00:54:19,436
Speaker 1: you hire the fanboys.

799
00:54:19,456 --> 00:54:20,540
Speaker 1: We're gonna be in there anyway.

800
00:54:21,624 --> 00:54:24,066
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah I think wouldn't be.

801
00:54:24,086 --> 00:54:27,440
Speaker 0: a much better idea is if all the dealers sorted their shit.

802
00:54:27,761 --> 00:54:29,327
Speaker 0: You could just give the dealer a list.

803
00:54:29,628 --> 00:54:29,829
Speaker 0: that would.

804
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:35,611
Speaker 0: that would have been nice because the main problem I had was in The big bins full of comics.

805
00:54:35,631 --> 00:54:37,260
Speaker 0: I had to look through them manually.

806
00:54:37,663 --> 00:54:40,440
Speaker 0: I would have much rather given the guy a list of what I wanted.

807
00:54:41,002 --> 00:54:47,939
Speaker 0: He would have gone through his bins and he knows everything is in his bins Collected it all for me and then give it to me in charge.

808
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,046
Speaker 1: now I'm not.

809
00:54:49,207 --> 00:54:54,470
Speaker 1: I don't want to sound like a conspiracy theorist But I have a sneaking feeling that some of that is intentional.

810
00:54:55,092 --> 00:54:58,000
Speaker 1: if you force them to look through they might see other stuff.

811
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:06,505
Speaker 0: Yeah, get up something might enter their eyes is 25 cents, you know and stuff did catch my eye when I was looking for spider-man I got speedball.

812
00:55:07,088 --> 00:55:08,656
Speaker 0: That's just for hilarity sake.

813
00:55:08,676 --> 00:55:19,243
Speaker 1: but then again I mean, we're pretty discerning because actually while we were at the shore the bookstore on the boardwalk We're selling all of their old manga which was mostly some pretty bad stuff 25 cent.

814
00:55:19,263 --> 00:55:20,346
Speaker 0: they were selling the comics.

815
00:55:20,507 --> 00:55:22,373
Speaker 0: one manga and now comics one.

816
00:55:22,393 --> 00:55:22,995
Speaker 0: It's not manga.

817
00:55:23,015 --> 00:55:24,499
Speaker 0: It's mostly Chinese stuff.

818
00:55:24,519 --> 00:55:29,574
Speaker 0: and Comics one was a company that brought over a bunch of pretty good Chinese comics.

819
00:55:29,614 --> 00:55:31,560
Speaker 1: Well, they also had like first president Japan.

820
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,409
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, no, that was the Raijin.

821
00:55:33,449 --> 00:55:35,600
Speaker 0: I think yeah, but I don't think that was comics one.

822
00:55:35,721 --> 00:55:38,455
Speaker 1: But yeah, I'm just saying that they also had the bookstore.

823
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:38,696
Speaker 0: Yes.

824
00:55:38,736 --> 00:55:39,420
Speaker 0: Yes, that's correct.

825
00:55:39,621 --> 00:55:42,452
Speaker 1: Now they were all 25 cents each and there was a pile of them.

826
00:55:42,532 --> 00:55:43,014
Speaker 0: Yeah, ma.

827
00:55:43,034 --> 00:55:48,807
Speaker 0: We're not talking comics for 25 cents Trait, you know Digest mangas for 25 cents.

828
00:55:48,867 --> 00:55:50,593
Speaker 1: I only bought like four.

829
00:55:50,934 --> 00:55:52,760
Speaker 1: they weren't even worth a quarter to me.

830
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:53,643
Speaker 0: I bought zero.

831
00:55:53,743 --> 00:55:56,652
Speaker 0: now I would if there were certain things there.

832
00:55:56,732 --> 00:55:58,899
Speaker 0: I would have paid the quarter without a second thought.

833
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:05,959
Speaker 0: like Comics one put out this great series Kazan and they put out a couple other great series, but I think one called one.

834
00:56:06,521 --> 00:56:11,077
Speaker 0: I'm not I don't remember but I would recognize it if I saw it and they didn't have those.

835
00:56:11,177 --> 00:56:13,225
Speaker 0: if they would have I would Have scooped him up instead.

836
00:56:13,265 --> 00:56:16,056
Speaker 0: They had basically complete crap that I wouldn't want to read it all.

837
00:56:16,457 --> 00:56:17,771
Speaker 0: so I didn't buy it Not even for 25 cents.

838
00:56:19,381 --> 00:56:22,837
Speaker 0: Now one good one thing about the comic-con was you were not there on Sunday.

839
00:56:22,957 --> 00:56:26,451
Speaker 0: on Sunday One of the dealers changed his 25 cent bins into 10 cent.

840
00:56:26,491 --> 00:56:36,036
Speaker 0: Whoa now If I had been there when there were 10 cent bins I would have loaded up on stuff that I even had the slightest interest in.

841
00:56:36,056 --> 00:56:38,270
Speaker 0: because well $0.10 for comic book.

842
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:38,532
Speaker 0: man.

843
00:56:38,794 --> 00:56:39,580
Speaker 1: now, we're resistant.

844
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:48,160
Speaker 1: However, I have a feeling that the comic types who would buy the 10 cent comic Then decide that they have to read the rest of it and then the cycle continues.

845
00:56:49,062 --> 00:56:56,092
Speaker 0: Yeah, well like for example, I went in and I saw Doom 2099 and now that's a comic.

846
00:56:56,112 --> 00:57:00,194
Speaker 0: that's kind of normal ish, you know I mean, I read spider-man 2099 when I was a kid.

847
00:57:01,604 --> 00:57:05,665
Speaker 0: So doom 2099 kind of goes with that and you know It's pretty cool-looking and all that.

848
00:57:06,268 --> 00:57:09,700
Speaker 0: and I found in a bin number one, two, three four.

849
00:57:09,841 --> 00:57:14,444
Speaker 0: So I kept going and going and then eventually it was like 12 24 36.

850
00:57:14,444 --> 00:57:19,956
Speaker 0: I don't think those are the exact numbers, but I was like, oh Well screw that I didn't buy any of it.

851
00:57:21,741 --> 00:57:27,100
Speaker 0: You know a comic guy would have gotten all of them and then gone elsewhere to try and fill in all the holes.

852
00:57:27,642 --> 00:57:29,950
Speaker 0: I'm saying if you don't got it all I ain't getting any of it.

853
00:57:30,493 --> 00:57:32,279
Speaker 1: I like how you went in twelves.

854
00:57:32,861 --> 00:57:35,029
Speaker 1: Yep, I just I found that interesting.

855
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:36,112
Speaker 0: Well year by year.

856
00:57:36,493 --> 00:57:36,754
Speaker 1: Yeah.

857
00:57:36,855 --> 00:57:40,338
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know because comics come out whatever It's just what came to mind.

858
00:57:41,742 --> 00:57:43,992
Speaker 1: But yeah, that was our experience at Philly Wizard World.

859
00:57:44,233 --> 00:57:45,780
Speaker 1: I was very underwhelmed.

860
00:57:46,302 --> 00:57:50,820
Speaker 1: It was really weird to have people not want to be interviewed.

861
00:57:51,041 --> 00:57:52,648
Speaker 1: I mean that's never happened to me before.

862
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:55,600
Speaker 0: I mean because you've been interviewing in so many places.

863
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,525
Speaker 1: Yeah But all the anime cars have interviewed.

864
00:57:57,546 --> 00:58:01,822
Speaker 1: I just started with the Katsu khan where I started doing it and no one ever turned me Down.

865
00:58:01,843 --> 00:58:09,260
Speaker 1: I interviewed freaking parents Cops who were standing nearby watching the khan Random people walking by the hotel who were like what the hell is all this?

868
00:58:14,629 --> 00:58:18,280
Speaker 1: It wasn't even that people didn't want to be interviewed It's that they didn't want to talk to me.

00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,324
Speaker 1: They didn't want to be bothered.

870
00:58:19,645 --> 00:58:24,884
Speaker 1: the fact that I talked to them like broke them out of this haze that they wanted to retreat Back into as quickly as possible.

871
00:58:25,346 --> 00:58:38,064
Speaker 0: Yep, you know and I didn't even really see people talking to each other other than People who came with each other Discussing things they had bought and and stuff like that except all the people who go to anime cons Ended up.

872
00:58:38,164 --> 00:58:44,672
Speaker 1: they seem to be all together like congregated in this open area And they were all hanging out having a ball and running around hitting each other with lightsabers.

886
00:59:19,125 --> 00:59:29,400

887
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:36,199
Speaker 1: Yep When you have volunteers doing everything and it's just people who want other people to have a good time Things always seem to work out better.

00:59:36,561 --> 00:59:48,180
Speaker 0: Then if you're paying people to provide a service to other people at a profit you all sorts remember This is Wizard World Wizard magazine as in the you know the magazine about comics and superheroes and shit.
