1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,760
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, January 4th, 2023.

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,041
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,692 --> 00:00:15,130
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,695
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:16,735 --> 00:00:20,270
Speaker 0: Tonight, we are talking about Keanu Reeves, Berserker.

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,128
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:29,510
Speaker 0: It will, it won't hit you like a truck, but, uh, I don't know, it's basically just Keanu Reeves as Wolverine.

8
00:00:31,936 --> 00:00:33,070
Speaker 1: Just jumping out a little bit on the review.

9
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,168
Speaker 1: He's a little more than Wolverine.

10
00:00:34,672 --> 00:00:42,447
Speaker 0: He's a little more than Wolverine, but there's big Wolverine vibes, and I just read an interview right before the show where someone was like, "So, your character's a lot like

11
00:00:42,467 --> 00:00:42,950
Speaker 0: Wolverine.".

12
00:00:43,151 --> 00:00:45,762
Speaker 0: And Keanu Reeves' response is like, "Yeah, I fucking love Wolverine.

13
00:00:45,782 --> 00:00:46,887
Speaker 0: I wanted to play Wolverine.

14
00:00:46,907 --> 00:00:47,268
Speaker 0: Wolverine's

15
00:00:47,389 --> 00:00:47,610
Speaker 0: awesome.".

16
00:00:49,534 --> 00:00:50,363
Speaker 0: Which, yeah, I like it.

17
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:54,308
Speaker 1: I don't think he, I mean, I guess he could kind of do Wolverine, but...

18
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,246
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, the interviewer was very much like, "Oh, you would be a great

19
00:00:58,287 --> 00:00:58,829
Speaker 0: Wolverine.".

20
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,310
Speaker 0: Depends on what kind of Wolverine you were going for.

21
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:05,206
Speaker 1: You don't tell anyone anything negative when you're interviewing them, but, you know, you're trying to be good with famous people.

22
00:01:05,226 --> 00:01:05,709
Speaker 1: That's right.

23
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:17,688
Speaker 0: [laughs] You only say bad things to a famous person if you're trying to provoke a reaction from them, or you're about to drop the bomb of, like, "Let's talk about the scandal that you don't know

24
00:01:17,748 --> 00:01:17,989
Speaker 0: about.".

25
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,208
Speaker 0: [laughs] Anyway...

26
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,347
Speaker 1: You don't actually ask that to the person to their face.

27
00:01:22,427 --> 00:01:22,690
Speaker 1: Come on.

28
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,133
Speaker 0: Depends.

29
00:01:23,194 --> 00:01:24,770
Speaker 0: It depends on the exact situation.

30
00:01:25,594 --> 00:01:30,490
Speaker 0: [laughs] But, uh, anyway, so, uh, you know, it's Wednesday, not Tuesday.

31
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:46,681
Speaker 0: Not gonna dwell on hockey too much, but, uh, there was a, the hockey game last night between the Rangers and the Carolina Hurricane was actually, like, that was a fucking great hockey game other than a really weird call at the end that I understand now, but it kind of gave the Rangers the game

32
00:01:46,702 --> 00:01:48,287
Speaker 1: in... Yeah, pretty much.

33
00:01:48,551 --> 00:01:49,303
Speaker 0: And I have seen...

34
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,870
Speaker 1: I mean, they were already ahead, but it sort of, it was like a, it was like a free-sealed deal.

35
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,227
Speaker 1: It's like, you're up by one, and they just give you one more so they can't win.

36
00:01:58,267 --> 00:01:58,970
Speaker 1: They can't catch up.

37
00:01:59,110 --> 00:01:59,331
Speaker 1: Yep.

38
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:10,789
Speaker 0: But it's, on one hand, I gotta preface this, because as a Rangers fan, it always feels like the Rangers, like, are usually on the wrong side of iffy calls, but...

39
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:16,704
Speaker 1: It does, it does feel like that, yet so many Rangers fans... I don't do this, right?

40
00:02:16,724 --> 00:02:17,350
Speaker 1: I call it out.

41
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,148
Speaker 1: But so many Rangers fans are always saying, "Ah, the league has it in for the

42
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:21,550
Speaker 1: Rangers.".

43
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,590
Speaker 0: But no, the league does not have it in for the Rangers.

44
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,091
Speaker 1: Right?

45
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:25,447
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "What the hell is wrong with

46
00:02:25,487 --> 00:02:25,589
Speaker 1: you?".

47
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:28,130
Speaker 1: If anything, the league wants the Rangers to win.

48
00:02:28,571 --> 00:02:31,650
Speaker 1: One of the biggest, most expensive teams with the most fans.

49
00:02:31,911 --> 00:02:34,529
Speaker 1: It's like, the league wants the Rangers to win real bad.

50
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,770
Speaker 0: They make a lot more money overall if the Rangers win the Stanley Cup than if, like, Buffalo wins it.

51
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:48,507
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much, like, if the league had their way, it would be all New York-Toronto all the time to make the biggest one, right?

52
00:02:48,547 --> 00:02:48,989
Speaker 1: They wouldn't...

53
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,779
Speaker 0: There's a way to do a hockey league.

54
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:59,732
Speaker 0: You have a league that's, forget original six, original two, it's just two teams, it's the best players, and it's just this, like, 50/50, like, nonsense game.

55
00:03:00,194 --> 00:03:02,263
Speaker 1: All-star game, but actually that's the only...

56
00:03:02,303 --> 00:03:04,892
Speaker 0: All-star game, but that's it, and like, every player...

57
00:03:05,113 --> 00:03:12,537
Speaker 1: You could just make a league that only has two teams, and they play seven games a year, and that's it.

58
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:13,961
Speaker 1: The end.

59
00:03:14,322 --> 00:03:16,308
Speaker 1: You know, I would... Up to seven games a year.

60
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:22,859
Speaker 0: I would watch that, but also that would be an okay way, if you got an esport that's, like, not big enough to have a real ecosystem.

61
00:03:23,481 --> 00:03:28,442
Speaker 0: That's the kind of league you make to get some buzz without, like, having to make a full league with a bunch of teams.

62
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:32,880
Speaker 1: I mean, you think about it sort of the way the individual sports work.

63
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,522
Speaker 1: It's like tennis.

64
00:03:33,543 --> 00:03:37,901
Speaker 1: There's four tennises a year that really matter, and the rest are lower tennises.

65
00:03:37,921 --> 00:03:39,890
Speaker 0: That's true, and, like, the tennis nerds pay attention.

66
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:45,237
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, there's a lot of people, but it's still tournaments with, you know, individual champions, and that's, you know...

67
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:55,560
Speaker 0: Yep, but basically there's this play at the end of the game where the ranger... So, one of the members of the Carolina Hurricanes was holding a hockey stick, and the stick just broke, which happened.

68
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,143
Speaker 0: Well, someone...

69
00:03:56,304 --> 00:03:59,218
Speaker 1: It was against the boards, and someone banged into it, and yeah, it broke.

70
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,183
Speaker 0: But they break.

71
00:04:00,263 --> 00:04:02,553
Speaker 0: Like, these are extremely dangerous, powerful people.

72
00:04:02,593 --> 00:04:07,014
Speaker 0: The kind of person where if they, like, if one of them punched me or Scott, we would just die, probably.

73
00:04:07,195 --> 00:04:08,480
Speaker 1: Hockey sticks break often.

74
00:04:09,102 --> 00:04:09,363
Speaker 0: Yep.

75
00:04:09,804 --> 00:04:14,382
Speaker 0: Like, I broke hockey sticks when I was a kid, like, especially, but these are, like, special hockey sticks.

76
00:04:14,423 --> 00:04:18,399
Speaker 0: Anyway, the rule in hockey is you can't play with a broken stick.

77
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:25,582
Speaker 0: So, if you play with a broken stick, because that is extremely dangerous, a broken hockey stick is basically a super sharp spear.

78
00:04:26,585 --> 00:04:26,785
Speaker 1: Yep.

79
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:33,692
Speaker 0: So, the rule is if your stick breaks, you have to drop it immediately, and it is a penalty if you play at all with it.

80
00:04:34,113 --> 00:04:38,427
Speaker 1: So, but in my entire life of watching hockey, that's been the rule, right?

81
00:04:38,548 --> 00:04:46,902
Speaker 1: And just about any hockey game you watch, you're gonna see at least once, if not more than once, hockey stick broken and someone throwing it away, right?

82
00:04:47,123 --> 00:04:50,276
Speaker 1: Immediately, like a hot potato, like, get that shit away from me, right?

83
00:04:50,296 --> 00:04:53,511
Speaker 1: Because you don't want a penalty, and you don't want to hurt someone also, right?

84
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:53,812
Speaker 1: Both.

85
00:04:54,194 --> 00:05:02,727
Speaker 1: So, and that's every single time in my entire life of all the hockey I've watched at every level, there's been many, many, many broken sticks in every single time.

86
00:05:02,787 --> 00:05:08,411
Speaker 1: So, it immediately throws the stick away, and I've never seen the penalty called because it never needed to be called.

87
00:05:08,552 --> 00:05:08,813
Speaker 1: Yep.

88
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:12,225
Speaker 1: Nobody ever actually tried to play with the broken stick.

89
00:05:12,265 --> 00:05:16,780
Speaker 0: The average NHL player will go through about 200 sticks a season.

90
00:05:17,162 --> 00:05:23,748
Speaker 1: But that's not that they break 200 sticks, it's that sticks wear out, or they just change a stick every game, or whatever, right?

91
00:05:23,768 --> 00:05:28,550
Speaker 1: And that's 80 something games, so that's like two sticks a game, two to three sticks a game, no big deal.

92
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:28,870
Speaker 1: Yep.

93
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:39,643
Speaker 0: So, in this situation, the penalty got called, and it's a situation where by the letter of the rules of hockey, that was the right call,

94
00:05:40,305 --> 00:05:49,870
Speaker 1: but simultaneously- The guy didn't realize the stick was broken for like about a second, maybe one second at most, but longer than usual, right?

95
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:50,412
Speaker 1: In terms of-.

96
00:05:50,432 --> 00:06:03,750
Speaker 0: But that would have been fine, because it turns out the rule is, if you are holding a broken stick, and the stick itself affects the play in any way, that is the penalty.

97
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,599
Speaker 0: So, whether or not you know it's broken does not matter.

98
00:06:09,263 --> 00:06:19,361
Speaker 0: So, in the end, I mean, I feel like the game is broken anyway, but it felt good, even though I'm sure my perception that luck goes against the Rangers more often than for them is wrong.

99
00:06:19,683 --> 00:06:27,997
Speaker 0: I'm sure that every hockey fan on earth believes that about their team, but you know what, I'll take it when luck goes our way, because how many pucks not stop that fucking-.

100
00:06:28,037 --> 00:06:34,787
Speaker 1: I mean, I would be super mad if that call was made against my team, I would be super mad if a Carolina fan said that was a bullshit call.

101
00:06:34,807 --> 00:06:36,453
Speaker 1: I'd say, "Yes, you're right, but I'll take

102
00:06:36,473 --> 00:06:36,513
Speaker 1: it.".

103
00:06:36,674 --> 00:06:36,834
Speaker 1: Yep.

104
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:38,460
Speaker 0: I feel like I'll take.

105
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,929
Speaker 0: it is a very hockey response, not other sports.

106
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,681
Speaker 1: Unlike earlier in the season, right, when Makar got a tripping penalty.

107
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:54,471
Speaker 1: He drew a tripping penalty, but he fell on his own, and he told the ref, "No, no, no, don't call the penalty,".

108
00:06:54,491 --> 00:06:55,133
Speaker 1: and the ref didn't.

109
00:06:57,138 --> 00:06:58,462
Speaker 1: And it's like, "I wouldn't do that.

110
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:00,026
Speaker 1: If it was just a whatever game-".

111
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,277
Speaker 0: No, that is too honorable.

112
00:07:03,377 --> 00:07:14,899
Speaker 1: That is like a Klingon letting another Klingon just kill them because of Yeah, it's like if it's just a whatever game, you know, yeah, I would do that sportsman-like behavior of saying, "No, no, no, don't call that penalty,".

113
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:21,804
Speaker 1: but this is a professional game where winning matters, and it's like, "Yeah, the ref was wrong.

114
00:07:21,864 --> 00:07:28,488
Speaker 1: I'll admit the ref was wrong if someone asked me, but I would never try to not win when it's an important for serious

115
00:07:28,528 --> 00:07:28,769
Speaker 1: game.".

116
00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:34,737
Speaker 0: I mean, what's the game we watch where the dude reaches into the goalie's mitt, pulls the puck out, and throws it into the net?

117
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,966
Speaker 1: And then pretends like it was a goal, right?

118
00:07:37,086 --> 00:07:41,865
Speaker 1: It's like he didn't get away with it, but I would absolutely can't blame him for trying.

119
00:07:41,905 --> 00:07:51,561
Speaker 0: I screencapped the screen on the HDPC because there's this moment where like the ref is talking to him, and he's like kind of laughing, and the ref just has this look on his face like, "Are you

120
00:07:51,642 --> 00:07:52,124
Speaker 0: serious?".

121
00:07:52,727 --> 00:07:58,801
Speaker 1: You're gonna waste every tens of this to maybe 20,000 people in just here and all the people at home watching.

122
00:07:58,821 --> 00:08:06,749
Speaker 1: You're going to take away this goal when you just threw the puck in the net with your hand.

123
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:13,434
Speaker 0: So anyway, in the news, this is too big a deal to not talk about, but I'm not going to dwell on it because it's Wednesday.

124
00:08:13,454 --> 00:08:16,910
Speaker 0: We're going to talk about comics, but something just happened in the U.S.

125
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,101
Speaker 0: House of Representatives that has not happened in a hundred years.

126
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:23,112
Speaker 1: It's happened more than once before, though.

127
00:08:23,152 --> 00:08:26,181
Speaker 0: No, so it has happened 14 times.

128
00:08:26,522 --> 00:08:27,766
Speaker 1: Oh, that's more than I thought.

129
00:08:27,866 --> 00:08:41,258
Speaker 0: It has happened 14 times in American history, and the last time it happened was in the year 1923, and in 1923 it was kind of a like ridiculous circumstance.

130
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,995
Speaker 0: Every single other time that it happened was in the lead-up to the Civil War.

131
00:08:46,557 --> 00:08:49,570
Speaker 0: Like, it was sort of a sign that the Civil War was about to happen.

132
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,415
Speaker 0: Like, for real.

133
00:08:51,716 --> 00:08:57,574
Speaker 0: Every single time it happened, other than 1923, was in the lead-up to the Civil War and was about slavery.

134
00:08:58,979 --> 00:09:01,707
Speaker 0: So it stopped happening after the Civil War.

135
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:07,444
Speaker 0: It happened once in 1923 with some weird fucked up nonsense, and now it just happened.

136
00:09:07,604 --> 00:09:10,793
Speaker 0: And as of today, they voted six times and failed.

137
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,641
Speaker 0: There is no Speaker of the House in the United States.

138
00:09:14,464 --> 00:09:22,770
Speaker 0: And the short summary of this, because this is like arcane rules that even American politicians don't super know.

139
00:09:23,192 --> 00:09:26,971
Speaker 0: Like that football game where like there was a tie and like not everyone really knew how ties worked.

140
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:33,592
Speaker 0: It's kind of like that, but for once, for you non-USians, the rule is actually like so simple.

141
00:09:33,954 --> 00:09:35,078
Speaker 0: it's almost ludicrous.

142
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,087
Speaker 1: It's one sentence in the Constitution.

143
00:09:37,127 --> 00:09:38,814
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's literally the actual Constitution.

144
00:09:38,874 --> 00:09:40,742
Speaker 1: It's not even like some other obscure law.

145
00:09:40,802 --> 00:09:43,133
Speaker 1: It's literally one sentence in the Constitution.

146
00:09:43,193 --> 00:09:45,605
Speaker 0: There's no like regal room for interpretation.

147
00:09:45,646 --> 00:09:46,490
Speaker 0: It's really straightforward.

148
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:55,872
Speaker 0: Every time there's a new Congress, which is every time we have a vote for the House of Representatives, the first thing they do is they bring in all the new members like, "Hey, you're all here.

149
00:09:55,972 --> 00:09:57,538
Speaker 0: We formed our new house.

150
00:09:57,558 --> 00:09:58,241
Speaker 0: We're starting a new

151
00:09:58,261 --> 00:09:58,643
Speaker 0: Congress.".

152
00:09:58,924 --> 00:10:03,199
Speaker 0: The next thing they do is the whole house just votes on who the Speaker of the House is.

153
00:10:04,122 --> 00:10:08,582
Speaker 0: The thing is, political parties don't exist as far as the American Constitution is concerned.

154
00:10:08,603 --> 00:10:09,809
Speaker 0: They're just a thing that people do.

155
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:11,717
Speaker 0: There's no rules about them.

156
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,405
Speaker 0: Like they don't exist in our government.

157
00:10:13,425 --> 00:10:14,691
Speaker 1: You can vote for whoever you wanted.

158
00:10:14,812 --> 00:10:17,163
Speaker 1: At least you can vote for someone who's in the room, right?

159
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:17,484
Speaker 0: Yeah.

160
00:10:17,926 --> 00:10:18,630
Speaker 1: You can't vote for me.

161
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:19,775
Speaker 0: Actually, you can.

162
00:10:19,795 --> 00:10:20,759
Speaker 0: They don't need to be in the room.

163
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,628
Speaker 0: There's a lot of nonsense.

164
00:10:22,648 --> 00:10:23,090
Speaker 1: Wait, hold on.

165
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,773
Speaker 1: I didn't know that.

166
00:10:23,793 --> 00:10:25,099
Speaker 1: That's new information here.

167
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:26,064
Speaker 1: Yeah, it can be anyone.

168
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:29,077
Speaker 1: Let's say that everyone in the House voted for me.

169
00:10:29,097 --> 00:10:30,785
Speaker 1: You're the Speaker of the House.

170
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:31,367
Speaker 1: You can resign.

171
00:10:31,488 --> 00:10:35,960
Speaker 1: Okay, that means obviously I'm in line to be President, right?

172
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:36,903
Speaker 0: If you're eligible.

173
00:10:37,164 --> 00:10:39,773
Speaker 1: But sure, I guess I'm not eligible to be President.

174
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:40,255
Speaker 1: Am I?

175
00:10:40,295 --> 00:10:40,777
Speaker 0: No, you are.

176
00:10:40,797 --> 00:10:41,720
Speaker 0: Okay.

177
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,724
Speaker 0: You absolutely are.

178
00:10:42,805 --> 00:10:44,651
Speaker 0: Unless you were not born on U.S.

179
00:10:44,692 --> 00:10:45,113
Speaker 0: soil.

180
00:10:45,594 --> 00:10:47,260
Speaker 1: Well, that's the age qualification.

181
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,346
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're definitely qualified.

182
00:10:49,366 --> 00:10:57,984
Speaker 1: Okay, anyway, the point is if I became Speaker of the House, but then I would conduct the business of the House and do all the Speaker's roles and have the Speaker's office.

183
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,236
Speaker 0: Which basically would mean you have unlimited power to decide.

184
00:11:00,296 --> 00:11:02,949
Speaker 1: I could be the boss of the guy with the mace over there, right?

185
00:11:02,989 --> 00:11:06,539
Speaker 0: You have basically unlimited power to decide what the House does.

186
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:19,646
Speaker 1: Sure, but when it came time to vote on a bill on whether it would become law or at least send it to the Senate to maybe become law, I would not have a vote because I would not be an elected representative from a state.

187
00:11:19,907 --> 00:11:23,249
Speaker 0: But you could do things like the House tries to pass a bill and you're just like, "No, you don't want...".

188
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:26,503
Speaker 1: I mean, I could do things much more powerful than voting, but I wouldn't have a vote.

189
00:11:26,684 --> 00:11:27,166
Speaker 0: Exactly.

190
00:11:27,508 --> 00:11:34,831
Speaker 1: So, okay, the fact that anyone can... Has anyone who is not a House representative been elected Speaker of the House ever?

191
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:41,854
Speaker 0: It's either happened zero or one times, and if it happened, the one time it happened was like 1700s.

192
00:11:42,757 --> 00:11:49,823
Speaker 1: Could they vote for someone who was like... Could they vote for the person who's already the President making themselves in line for their own job?

193
00:11:50,305 --> 00:12:00,014
Speaker 0: I don't think there's a rule against that, but I'm pretty sure there are rules against the situation that causes... But I don't actually know.

194
00:12:00,034 --> 00:12:03,667
Speaker 1: Could they vote for a Senator to have that job?

195
00:12:03,687 --> 00:12:06,478
Speaker 0: I don't... Well, I think, again, they could vote for anyone.

196
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:07,222
Speaker 0: The problem...

197
00:12:07,262 --> 00:12:09,974
Speaker 1: Could they vote for the Governor of a state to have that job?

198
00:12:10,035 --> 00:12:12,504
Speaker 1: So someone would be Governor of a state and also...

199
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:18,247
Speaker 0: I am pretty confident, based on everything I've read, they could vote for anyone.

200
00:12:18,267 --> 00:12:24,132
Speaker 0: They could even vote for someone who is not a citizen and who is not able to be President because they weren't born on US soil.

201
00:12:24,514 --> 00:12:26,424
Speaker 0: All that means is they get skipped in the line of succession.

202
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:28,354
Speaker 1: But anyway, they can't agree on anyone right now.

203
00:12:28,454 --> 00:12:39,489
Speaker 0: So basically, because the vote is the entire House, and our fascist party only holds the House by a few seats, if any four Republicans don't vote for...

204
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:39,870
Speaker 1: No, three.

205
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:40,531
Speaker 1: Three.

206
00:12:40,691 --> 00:12:40,912
Speaker 0: Four.

207
00:12:42,055 --> 00:12:53,030
Speaker 1: They have a lead of four seats, so if three people vote otherwise... Yeah, so they... I guess three means they're voting for the Democrat.

208
00:12:53,491 --> 00:13:04,147
Speaker 0: Yeah, so basically, every time we vote, there are 212 votes for a Democrat, because that is actually the person who keeps winning these votes, but you need a majority to become Speaker.

209
00:13:04,588 --> 00:13:08,121
Speaker 0: So the Democrats all vote for a really good person, Akeem Jeffries.

210
00:13:08,141 --> 00:13:16,810
Speaker 0: 200-ish Republicans vote for an absolute dipshit guy, and then like 20 Republicans vote for an even fashier dipshit.

211
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,719
Speaker 1: It's the even fashier dipshit.

212
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:21,988
Speaker 1: It's like, "How much worse can you

213
00:13:22,008 --> 00:13:22,209
Speaker 1: get?".

214
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:29,953
Speaker 0: But the reason this is happening is that the 20-ish people who are basically saying, "Nope, we're not going to let it

215
00:13:29,973 --> 00:13:30,275
Speaker 0: happen."

216
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:39,175
Speaker 0: They're the kinds of people who do not care what happens to Congress at all, and they were elected by people who don't believe the 2020 election was fair and who are just crazy.

217
00:13:39,636 --> 00:13:49,650
Speaker 0: So their base loves this, meaning they'll get re-elected into the House forever, and they benefit from the Republicans and the Democrats failing to do anything.

218
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:55,052
Speaker 0: So they're basically holding the Republican Party hostage, and they're holding America hostage, because guess what?

219
00:13:55,353 --> 00:13:58,705
Speaker 0: Until the House has a Speaker, the House cannot do anything.

220
00:13:59,026 --> 00:14:00,973
Speaker 0: It can't even pay its members.

221
00:14:01,254 --> 00:14:02,317
Speaker 0: It can't hire aides.

222
00:14:02,598 --> 00:14:03,581
Speaker 0: It can't hire staff.

223
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:04,805
Speaker 0: It can't process payroll.

224
00:14:05,106 --> 00:14:07,754
Speaker 0: It can do nothing, and the rule is...

225
00:14:07,774 --> 00:14:12,228
Speaker 1: Well, they could theoretically still pass a law.

226
00:14:12,288 --> 00:14:12,810
Speaker 0: No, they can't.

227
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,297
Speaker 1: It doesn't say that in the Constitution.

228
00:14:16,337 --> 00:14:18,667
Speaker 1: It still says they could get a majority.

229
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:19,992
Speaker 1: They could vote for a law.

230
00:14:20,133 --> 00:14:23,122
Speaker 0: The House needs a Speaker to bring the bill to the floor.

231
00:14:23,784 --> 00:14:27,766
Speaker 1: I thought that's a rule that they would have to elect a Speaker and pass rules to make that a rule every time.

232
00:14:27,786 --> 00:14:30,397
Speaker 0: The House needs to elect a Speaker to have a rule.

233
00:14:31,701 --> 00:14:38,290
Speaker 1: Right, but you don't need to have a rule of making a law is in the Constitution, so that's the one rule you don't need to vote into being a rule.

234
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:47,720
Speaker 0: The Speaker... So there are extremely arcane things that could happen, but effectively, the way this works is now playoff hockey overtime rules.

235
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:53,806
Speaker 0: They just keep voting, and the dipshit caucus, which actually a few reporters are even calling them now.

236
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:57,263
Speaker 0: on the Republican side, they basically said, "Nothing will convince us.

237
00:14:57,504 --> 00:14:59,373
Speaker 0: We're going to vote against this guy forever.

238
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:00,417
Speaker 0: We will not

239
00:15:00,438 --> 00:15:00,960
Speaker 0: negotiate.".

240
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:01,381
Speaker 1: Good.

241
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,446
Speaker 1: Do nothing for two years.

242
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:03,169
Speaker 1: That would be amazing.

243
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:08,692
Speaker 0: That would be the best possible outcome compared to the alternative of the fascist party doing anything, literally anything.

244
00:15:09,995 --> 00:15:16,873
Speaker 0: So this is unprecedented territory that we have not been in since before the Civil War.

245
00:15:16,893 --> 00:15:23,755
Speaker 0: It is worth reading up the details of this because this is ongoing, and it's a shit show.

246
00:15:23,795 --> 00:15:27,305
Speaker 0: This is an absolute clown circus fuck-up.

247
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:28,790
Speaker 0: Nobody expected this.

248
00:15:29,252 --> 00:15:31,240
Speaker 0: I even didn't think this would actually happen.

249
00:15:31,521 --> 00:15:33,168
Speaker 0: Like, this is the kind of thing...

250
00:15:33,188 --> 00:15:34,555
Speaker 1: I just want to put this out there.

251
00:15:34,736 --> 00:15:38,492
Speaker 1: I mean, sure, someone else has already put this out there, but if you know, if we only need...

252
00:15:38,512 --> 00:15:48,688
Speaker 0: Oh, the Democrats are heavily, heavily trying to convince a few Republicans who aren't even going to run for re-election, like they're on their way out.

253
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:51,119
Speaker 0: They're in the current Congress, like not the new one that's coming in.

254
00:15:51,662 --> 00:15:53,891
Speaker 0: Just vote for someone good and then retire.

255
00:15:55,094 --> 00:15:57,120
Speaker 1: That's one way out.

256
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,063
Speaker 1: That's one way out.

257
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,426
Speaker 1: There's another way out, right?

258
00:15:59,928 --> 00:16:05,902
Speaker 1: Go convince three states to recall their Republicans.

259
00:16:05,922 --> 00:16:11,419
Speaker 1: Or even better, and if they send Democrats instead, right, then that's enough votes for the Democrats.

260
00:16:11,439 --> 00:16:12,705
Speaker 0: Scott, it's even easier than that.

261
00:16:13,046 --> 00:16:14,855
Speaker 0: The rule is not the majority of the House.

262
00:16:14,935 --> 00:16:16,925
Speaker 0: The rule is the majority of the members present.

263
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:19,895
Speaker 1: Oh, you just trapped someone outside.

264
00:16:19,915 --> 00:16:20,437
Speaker 0: So guess what?

265
00:16:20,758 --> 00:16:26,059
Speaker 0: If a small number of Republicans don't show up and quorum gets called, Democrats just win.

266
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,766
Speaker 1: How do you call the quorum without the speaker?

267
00:16:28,047 --> 00:16:28,670
Speaker 1: Who's in charge?

268
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:36,296
Speaker 0: So the actual procedure is first, the teller, like the administrative staff, do a vote to see if there is a quorum.

269
00:16:36,859 --> 00:16:39,672
Speaker 1: What if those people aren't present because they're not being paid and they just go home?

270
00:16:39,773 --> 00:16:44,676
Speaker 0: Then there can't be a quorum and we have a constitutional crisis and that has never happened and nobody knows what to do.

271
00:16:46,021 --> 00:16:47,567
Speaker 1: What if Mace Guy is just like, "Fuck this

272
00:16:47,588 --> 00:16:47,788
Speaker 1: shit.".

273
00:16:48,331 --> 00:16:49,838
Speaker 0: I hope Mace Guy just fucking leaves.

274
00:16:51,004 --> 00:16:59,112
Speaker 0: See, it's funny, if this was the UK, you know there'd be like, in the wimbly dimbly of 1840, the Mace something something and by their grace and his pleasure.

275
00:16:59,132 --> 00:17:05,714
Speaker 1: Well, you know, you gotta say a point in favor of the monarchy is that, you know, there is a fallback.

276
00:17:06,297 --> 00:17:14,867
Speaker 1: You have this sort of on-paper autocrat that doesn't actually do anything and just lets the democracy happen, but the democracy really collapses, right?

277
00:17:14,887 --> 00:17:18,863
Speaker 1: It's like, technically, the monarch can be like poke, right?

278
00:17:18,883 --> 00:17:19,705
Speaker 0: You know what I would say?

279
00:17:19,726 --> 00:17:22,596
Speaker 0: This is a total aside, but this is actually a real opinion I have.

280
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:32,471
Speaker 0: Stopping Brexit would have been like the moment for a monarch to do something and the fact that they chose not to ended even that power of the monarchy.

281
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,998
Speaker 1: Yes, well, that particular monarchy, yeah.

282
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,121
Speaker 0: Yep.

283
00:17:36,261 --> 00:17:41,716
Speaker 1: I'm not saying I would, I mean, this is a point in favor.

284
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:43,883
Speaker 0: There are a surprising number of...

285
00:17:43,923 --> 00:17:48,740
Speaker 1: While I have spoken a point in favor of monarchies, I am not in favor of monarchies.

286
00:17:48,781 --> 00:17:51,130
Speaker 1: The con list is much longer than the pro list.

287
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:58,054
Speaker 0: Like, if you list all the pros and cons of heroin, there are some pros, but there are thousands and thousands of cons.

288
00:17:58,395 --> 00:17:59,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, heroin feels great.

289
00:18:00,101 --> 00:18:06,366
Speaker 1: If I just say that and I don't talk about all the cons of heroin, I just don't want someone to think I'm pro-heroine.

290
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:08,758
Speaker 0: We did that panel a long time where we were like, "What's the most fun game on Earth?

291
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:09,321
Speaker 0: Just take

292
00:18:09,361 --> 00:18:09,764
Speaker 0: heroin.".

293
00:18:10,307 --> 00:18:11,352
Speaker 0: Doesn't mean you should play it.

294
00:18:11,573 --> 00:18:13,099
Speaker 1: There might be better games than that.

295
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,405
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm mega-heroine.

296
00:18:14,706 --> 00:18:16,893
Speaker 1: I haven't tried any of those, that whole genre, on purpose.

297
00:18:16,913 --> 00:18:18,156
Speaker 1: Yeah, that and MMOs, never once.

298
00:18:18,176 --> 00:18:19,699
Speaker 0: Anyway.

299
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:21,222
Speaker 0: I played some months.

300
00:18:25,392 --> 00:18:27,681
Speaker 0: It's some animation news, because I don't dwell on that.

301
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:33,141
Speaker 0: You can read an article that'll be way more informed than I am about the arcane procedures of the American house.

302
00:18:33,663 --> 00:18:38,599
Speaker 0: MF Ghost, the anime that's just more Initial D. We have our third trailer.

303
00:18:39,061 --> 00:18:40,124
Speaker 0: It has Eurobeat in it.

304
00:18:40,425 --> 00:18:43,695
Speaker 0: This is the trailer that actually has Eurobeat in it.

305
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:46,323
Speaker 0: This is the final actual confirmation.

306
00:18:46,343 --> 00:18:48,390
Speaker 0: Initial D2 has Eurobeat.

307
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,696
Speaker 0: That is all I needed to hear.

308
00:18:49,716 --> 00:18:50,520
Speaker 0: I literally don't care.

309
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:51,828
Speaker 1: I mean, technically, this isn't Initial D2.

310
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:56,266
Speaker 1: They've already had Initial D1, 2, 3, however many Initial D's.

311
00:18:56,286 --> 00:18:59,478
Speaker 0: I watched through, like, Fourth Stage or whatever?

312
00:18:59,498 --> 00:19:01,366
Speaker 0: Anyway, I watched a lot more Initial D than you do.

313
00:19:01,386 --> 00:19:06,608
Speaker 1: This is the point at which, basically, you know, MF Ghost manga, to my knowledge, has been around a while.

314
00:19:06,668 --> 00:19:11,050
Speaker 1: But basically, the same guy who made Initial D is like, "Okay, I can't do anything more with these characters.

315
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,315
Speaker 1: Times have changed, right?

316
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:20,021
Speaker 1: I will just, rather than make more Initial D, I'll just make another car manga with new characters, new cars, new

317
00:19:20,121 --> 00:19:20,383
Speaker 1: everything.".

318
00:19:20,403 --> 00:19:25,123
Speaker 0: So, Scott, I'm gonna name some names of characters who are now confirmed to be in the manga and the show.

319
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:34,022
Speaker 0: Takahashi Ryosuke, Takahashi Keisuke, Ikitani, Itsuki, Kenji are all in the show.

320
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:35,125
Speaker 0: Okay.

321
00:19:35,766 --> 00:19:41,650
Speaker 0: It literally is following the dream project that they started in Initial D, so it really is kind of just... Are they this old?

322
00:19:42,152 --> 00:19:42,995
Speaker 0: It is, I guess.

323
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,050
Speaker 0: So, yeah, this is gonna be the dumbest show that I watch.

324
00:19:50,913 --> 00:19:51,516
Speaker 0: You got any news?

325
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:54,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, so let's talk about something, you know, good being made.

326
00:19:55,891 --> 00:19:58,159
Speaker 0: Oh my god, I'm so excited about this.

327
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:17,414
Speaker 1: Right, so Cartoon Saloon, who we are big fans of here at Geek Nights, the Irish animation studio that brought you the Irish trilogy, as well as many other amazing works, and as well as many other works that we don't really pay attention to, like some kids' TV shows like that, Puffin Rock, or whatever, which I'm sure if I had a child, I would show it to them, but...

328
00:20:17,455 --> 00:20:20,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, one of the rare batting a thousand entities on Earth.

329
00:20:22,412 --> 00:20:25,546
Speaker 1: Yeah, so they're, you know, they gotta make some more movies now, right?

330
00:20:25,566 --> 00:20:28,558
Speaker 1: They finished that Wolf Walkers, they gotta go to the next, right?

331
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:30,285
Speaker 1: It's like, what are they gonna make now?

332
00:20:31,469 --> 00:20:37,573
Speaker 1: You know, it's like, well, wisely, they're not like, "Okay, guy who's directed everything we've made, make something

333
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:37,934
Speaker 1: again.".

334
00:20:37,954 --> 00:20:43,354
Speaker 1: You know, it's like, let's get some new people in here, we'll animate what they want instead, right?

335
00:20:44,097 --> 00:21:00,041
Speaker 1: So, someone I've never heard of, but has an Oscar nomination named Louise Bagnall, I hope I'm pronouncing their name correctly, they made a short called Late Afternoon, which I think was the Oscar-nominated thing.

336
00:21:00,061 --> 00:21:08,611
Speaker 1: I think they also made, let's see, cartoon development, Oscar-nominated, debut feature, Julian.

337
00:21:09,072 --> 00:21:35,450
Speaker 1: Right, okay, so there's a book called Julian is a Mermaid by Jessica Love, and Louise Bagnall is going to direct the full-length animated feature adaptation of Julian is a Mermaid, but it's only called Julian, and Cartoon Saloon, the same studio that did the Wolf Walkers and the Song of the Sea and all that, is going to be the studio receiving that direction.

338
00:21:37,151 --> 00:21:37,854
Speaker 1: We got it sorted.

339
00:21:38,596 --> 00:21:43,975
Speaker 1: The point is, Julian is a Mermaid is like an awesome story, it's obviously a kid's book, right?

340
00:21:44,457 --> 00:21:49,518
Speaker 1: But it's an awesome story about New York, so it's like, yep, they finished their Ireland, and like, where are we going next?

341
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:50,423
Speaker 1: New York, that's right.

342
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:51,046
Speaker 0: Yep.

343
00:21:51,388 --> 00:21:51,790
Speaker 1: Let's go.

344
00:21:53,351 --> 00:22:02,771
Speaker 0: Right alongside, we're both reading, or I'll be imminently reading, as I finish and leave the unseen, the world we make, which seems like I'm just gonna burn through that thing pretty quick.

345
00:22:05,018 --> 00:22:08,429
Speaker 1: So yeah, who knows when this is coming out, or how it's coming out, or anything.

346
00:22:08,469 --> 00:22:20,350
Speaker 0: Whenever it comes out, I imagine we will be in the theater seeing it in New York, because you can see any animated movie in New York when it comes out, and I highly encourage you to see this sight unseen.

347
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:23,701
Speaker 0: You don't need a review to know to go see this movie.

348
00:22:24,062 --> 00:22:26,491
Speaker 1: I mean, this is in a super early stage, right?

349
00:22:26,531 --> 00:22:35,896
Speaker 1: It says they're gonna pitch it in March at a French event or whatever, so it's in the pitching phase, I guess.

350
00:22:35,936 --> 00:22:49,627
Speaker 1: They're trying to get some monies and whatnot, but it's like, so far, usually when I see a news about a movie, especially movies, that early, you can't say it's gonna happen, because Mouseguard had people animating it, and it didn't happen, right?

351
00:22:49,647 --> 00:22:56,270
Speaker 1: They filmed whole movies, and they never got released, but Cartoon Salute has never failed to release it.

352
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:59,441
Speaker 1: It's a thing that they have mentioned publicly.

353
00:23:00,124 --> 00:23:06,414
Speaker 1: They've always found a way, so I'm confident that within maybe a few years, we will see this, and that'll be pretty good.

354
00:23:12,038 --> 00:23:14,623
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day!

355
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:20,102
Speaker 0: I try not to use, we both try not to use the same channel or the same website like more than once.

356
00:23:21,106 --> 00:23:22,651
Speaker 0: Obviously, you know, a lot of gig nights.

357
00:23:22,691 --> 00:23:23,193
Speaker 0: We started in 2005.

358
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:36,204
Speaker 0: Otherwise, it'd be easy to just do practical engineering like every fucking week for me, but I realized I've used SciShow and a bunch of other things that John and/or Hank Green have made over the years, so I can't use those channels.

359
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:43,547
Speaker 0: I have never used the Vlogbrothers as a thing of the day, so this video from a year ago that's new to me.

360
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:45,132
Speaker 1: Is it the vlog?

361
00:23:45,714 --> 00:23:47,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, Vlog or Vlog, Video Log.

362
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,203
Speaker 1: You mean vlog?

363
00:23:50,323 --> 00:23:50,825
Speaker 0: Vlog.

364
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:52,370
Speaker 1: Vlog?

365
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:55,280
Speaker 1: I mean, I gotta post an article on my Vlog.

366
00:23:57,484 --> 00:23:59,859
Speaker 0: I was thinking it was the guy in that video who calls it his home page.

367
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:08,960
Speaker 0: Anyway, so this video is titled "So Orange Juice Isn't What It Seems" and one, it's really funny.

368
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,053
Speaker 0: Like, Hank Green definitely has evolved and extremely...

369
00:24:13,073 --> 00:24:14,378
Speaker 1: Eh, I watched it.

370
00:24:14,438 --> 00:24:15,403
Speaker 1: It's a YouTube yelling guy.

371
00:24:15,423 --> 00:24:16,107
Speaker 0: I don't think it's funny.

372
00:24:16,127 --> 00:24:17,917
Speaker 0: I think Hank Green's style is extremely funny.

373
00:24:17,937 --> 00:24:22,458
Speaker 0: I actually very much like his evolved current, like the style he grew into about five years ago.

374
00:24:22,478 --> 00:24:22,980
Speaker 0: Did not lol.

375
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:23,983
Speaker 1: No lols.

376
00:24:24,003 --> 00:24:24,826
Speaker 0: You don't laugh at anything.

377
00:24:24,846 --> 00:24:27,757
Speaker 1: I laugh at it, it's actually funny.

378
00:24:28,138 --> 00:24:46,720
Speaker 0: But the more important thing is that this video sort of condenses all the things I think about orange juice very succinctly into a video and none of this is new to me or Scott, but if you drink orange juice and you think you know anything about the orange juice you're drinking, you're probably wrong.

379
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,213
Speaker 0: And also, orange juice is not better for you than just fucking soda.

380
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,301
Speaker 0: Like, I still drink orange juice.

381
00:24:52,361 --> 00:24:56,515
Speaker 0: I love orange juice, but in the words of Hank Green, it's just candy water.

382
00:24:56,535 --> 00:25:05,912
Speaker 1: Well, the one thing he doesn't mention, which is what I did to basically stop drinking orange juice, which is, you know, he compares, you know, the fresh orange juice, right?

383
00:25:05,952 --> 00:25:07,760
Speaker 1: Get oranges and squeeze them, right?

384
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,192
Speaker 1: Whereas what I just do is I just eat oranges.

385
00:25:11,273 --> 00:25:13,201
Speaker 1: You don't have to squeeze them, just eat the or- Oh, peel.

386
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:16,075
Speaker 1: You don't have to peel, but you take the- Peel it and fucking eat it.

387
00:25:16,196 --> 00:25:19,089
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the problem is that slows you down like a pistachio.

388
00:25:19,129 --> 00:25:21,178
Speaker 0: You got to open each pistachio and eat them.

389
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:23,287
Speaker 1: Drinking orange juice is like- No, no, no.

390
00:25:23,327 --> 00:25:27,786
Speaker 1: You open a pistachio and you get, like, one little nut and you have to open a bunch of them.

391
00:25:27,827 --> 00:25:31,581
Speaker 1: An orange, you can open one orange and you get a ton of orange.

392
00:25:31,722 --> 00:25:40,329
Speaker 0: But I can drink orange juice and it's like the equivalent of just funneling a bag of pre-shelled pistachios directly into my mouth.

393
00:25:40,931 --> 00:25:41,875
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a bad idea.

394
00:25:41,895 --> 00:25:42,618
Speaker 1: It's a good idea.

395
00:25:42,638 --> 00:25:43,662
Speaker 0: It's a great idea.

396
00:25:43,763 --> 00:25:44,345
Speaker 1: It's a bad idea.

397
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:48,017
Speaker 1: I eat like 5000 calories a day in the summer, so.

398
00:25:48,037 --> 00:25:51,349
Speaker 1: At least in North America, it's orange season like now-ish, right?

399
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:54,399
Speaker 1: Go and just buy a sack of oranges.

400
00:25:54,439 --> 00:25:55,765
Speaker 1: That's the cheapest way to get them.

401
00:25:56,046 --> 00:25:58,274
Speaker 1: And just eat oranges every morning.

402
00:25:58,315 --> 00:26:02,110
Speaker 1: And that's- You'll get fiber and everything and there's still delicious juice in there.

403
00:26:02,392 --> 00:26:09,236
Speaker 1: You still experience plenty of juice flavor, but you take in much less candy water into your body.

404
00:26:09,256 --> 00:26:13,536
Speaker 0: Thing is, I'm seeking the candy water because remember, I'm all- I'm pretty much always at a calorie deficit.

405
00:26:13,576 --> 00:26:15,084
Speaker 0: Like, I got to keep eating or I have trouble.

406
00:26:15,165 --> 00:26:15,929
Speaker 1: Eat more oranges.

407
00:26:15,969 --> 00:26:16,652
Speaker 1: Eat the whole sack.

408
00:26:16,954 --> 00:26:19,967
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if I eat the whole sack, I could also juice the whole sack and drink it.

409
00:26:21,152 --> 00:26:23,662
Speaker 1: You're throwing away all that useful delicious fibers.

410
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,530
Speaker 0: Nah, but I also- I zest them all for cocktails.

411
00:26:26,972 --> 00:26:27,975
Speaker 0: Anyway, what do you got?

412
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:29,761
Speaker 1: What do I have?

413
00:26:29,801 --> 00:26:32,190
Speaker 1: So, I didn't know this sport existed, which is very rare.

414
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:34,298
Speaker 1: It's underwater hockey.

415
00:26:34,318 --> 00:26:36,287
Speaker 1: Apparently, people in the UK play it.

416
00:26:36,327 --> 00:26:37,796
Speaker 1: I don't know if anyone else anywhere else plays it.

417
00:26:37,856 --> 00:26:39,483
Speaker 0: I kind of want to try to play it.

418
00:26:39,563 --> 00:26:45,601
Speaker 1: I thought this was one of those fake concocted documentary videos, but no, it's real.

419
00:26:47,446 --> 00:26:52,739
Speaker 1: This may be among- first of all, the notable things about this sport, right?

420
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:54,125
Speaker 1: So, it's underwater hockey.

421
00:26:54,426 --> 00:27:03,162
Speaker 1: There's a puck just like a hockey- ice hockey puck and you have a little tiny sticks and the puck is at the bottom of the swimming pool and you're trying to get it into a goal.

422
00:27:03,704 --> 00:27:05,512
Speaker 1: It's- the rules are what you think they are.

423
00:27:05,572 --> 00:27:07,420
Speaker 1: The problem is, it's at the bottom of the pool.

424
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,525
Speaker 1: It's three meters deep.

425
00:27:09,887 --> 00:27:11,251
Speaker 1: Meters, right?

426
00:27:11,452 --> 00:27:13,558
Speaker 1: You can't- you got to dive to get down there.

427
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:15,648
Speaker 1: Everyone's got flippers and goggles and everything.

428
00:27:15,668 --> 00:27:20,646
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's going to be no Shaq situation where someone's so tall they can just kind of kick it or something.

429
00:27:22,371 --> 00:27:26,400
Speaker 1: But, good luck staying down there that long, right?

430
00:27:26,481 --> 00:27:37,208
Speaker 1: It's like even if you're the Wayne Gretzky of swim hockey, pool underwater hockey, like you go down there, you can be amazing, but it's like there's no way you're going to get the puck all the way from one end of the pool to the other.

431
00:27:37,228 --> 00:27:38,374
Speaker 1: It's a full-size pool.

432
00:27:38,535 --> 00:27:44,297
Speaker 0: And even more, the harder you play, the more you use up your oxygen and the less time you can spend down there.

433
00:27:44,317 --> 00:27:51,097
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like you basically must have like teamwork to be any good at this game.

434
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:55,472
Speaker 1: You cannot- it's not an individual- it's like the least individual sport ever, right?

435
00:27:55,513 --> 00:28:02,522
Speaker 1: Like your whole- you could have a team- like one person in the video even says you could put all the best players in the same team and they would suck.

436
00:28:02,603 --> 00:28:04,391
Speaker 1: The team that wins all the time is this team.

437
00:28:04,412 --> 00:28:05,778
Speaker 1: that's like been together for 12 years.

438
00:28:06,422 --> 00:28:07,869
Speaker 1: They all know what everyone's going to do.

439
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,819
Speaker 1: They've got all their systems worked out, right?

440
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,195
Speaker 1: You know, and they've had very few lineup changes and that team dominates, right?

441
00:28:14,215 --> 00:28:19,539
Speaker 1: Because that's- it's all about- you talk about coordination of like, you know, some FPS team in Overwatch.

442
00:28:19,579 --> 00:28:24,053
Speaker 1: It's like comes nothing close to, you know, the underwater hockey.

443
00:28:24,073 --> 00:28:30,816
Speaker 1: And the second thing is that the underwater hockey may be the most physically demanding sport I've ever seen.

444
00:28:30,836 --> 00:28:37,319
Speaker 1: Like it doesn't look physically demanding like, you know, a weightlifting or a sprinting or a, you know, a gymnastics.

445
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:38,142
Speaker 0: I'll give you an example.

446
00:28:38,303 --> 00:28:42,982
Speaker 0: I can run- I can run a half marathon without even breaking a sweat in under two hours.

447
00:28:43,022 --> 00:28:44,106
Speaker 0: Like I just feel great at the end.

448
00:28:44,688 --> 00:28:49,464
Speaker 0: I can't swim more than like half a mile without being fucking wrecked.

449
00:28:50,126 --> 00:28:51,491
Speaker 1: But it's like just swimming.

450
00:28:51,571 --> 00:28:53,257
Speaker 1: But like, no, this isn't just swimming.

451
00:28:53,297 --> 00:29:00,674
Speaker 1: This is- you're going underwater and holding your breath for a significant amount of time, coming back up and then trying to go back under as soon as possible.

452
00:29:00,734 --> 00:29:05,871
Speaker 1: And when you're down there, swimming with flippers as hard as you can, right?

453
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:10,430
Speaker 1: And it's like, if you're the goalie, it's like the goalie I think is the most fascinating thing.

454
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:14,787
Speaker 1: They didn't talk about it in the video, but I sort of noticed like, do you have a goalie even?

455
00:29:14,988 --> 00:29:16,774
Speaker 1: It's like, why bother, right?

456
00:29:16,834 --> 00:29:20,466
Speaker 1: But the goalie can't just stay down there and wait the whole time.

457
00:29:20,486 --> 00:29:25,565
Speaker 1: The goalie has to stay up and look into the water with their goggles and their snorkel.

458
00:29:25,786 --> 00:29:27,070
Speaker 1: Like they have snorkels, short ones.

459
00:29:28,213 --> 00:29:34,255
Speaker 1: And like, see if the puck is coming close to the goal and when it does, time their dive, right?

460
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:37,665
Speaker 1: It's like the goalie might go down, make a save, right?

461
00:29:37,926 --> 00:29:41,679
Speaker 1: Run out of breath and be like, "Am I gonna die or are we gonna get scored

462
00:29:41,699 --> 00:29:41,739
Speaker 1: on?".

463
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,260
Speaker 0: Yep, go down too early and you gotta come up and then undefended goal, empty net.

464
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,553
Speaker 1: Yeah, do you have two goalies like rotating?

465
00:29:48,573 --> 00:29:49,437
Speaker 1: Like what are you gonna do?

466
00:29:49,498 --> 00:29:51,423
Speaker 1: It's like, I don't know.

467
00:29:52,004 --> 00:29:54,151
Speaker 1: But yeah, I would never play this.

468
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:55,656
Speaker 1: I would never watch it.

469
00:29:55,716 --> 00:29:59,229
Speaker 0: If it were easy to play, like I would want to play a game of this.

470
00:29:59,289 --> 00:30:00,596
Speaker 0: This would be really fun, I think.

471
00:30:00,656 --> 00:30:02,645
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would play in a much shallower pool.

472
00:30:02,665 --> 00:30:06,059
Speaker 0: I play in a deep pool, but I would want to play it with people who are...

473
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,325
Speaker 1: Not three meters.

474
00:30:07,426 --> 00:30:08,914
Speaker 1: It had to be like three meters to be fun.

475
00:30:08,994 --> 00:30:13,033
Speaker 0: I just want to, I would play it against people who are as bad at it as I expect I will be.

476
00:30:13,053 --> 00:30:14,680
Speaker 0: I don't want to play against people who are good.

477
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:20,706
Speaker 1: The problem with the three meter pool is that like I would have a hard time even getting to the bottom period.

478
00:30:20,726 --> 00:30:21,712
Speaker 0: Blow on flippers.

479
00:30:21,752 --> 00:30:22,215
Speaker 0: make that real.

480
00:30:22,235 --> 00:30:23,622
Speaker 0: Have you ever swum with... They help, they help.

481
00:30:23,662 --> 00:30:25,228
Speaker 0: Have you ever swum with flippers?

482
00:30:25,348 --> 00:30:27,256
Speaker 0: It is like quadruple speed.

483
00:30:27,336 --> 00:30:28,400
Speaker 0: Like it is, it's hacks.

484
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,121
Speaker 1: But also I could only stay down, you know, the amount of time it would take me to get to the bottom.

485
00:30:33,162 --> 00:30:35,010
Speaker 1: I'd be able to hockey for like a few seconds.

486
00:30:35,271 --> 00:30:38,366
Speaker 1: It's like, give me the one and a half meter, two meter pool.

487
00:30:38,386 --> 00:30:40,134
Speaker 1: Then I can actually do some hockey.

488
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:41,240
Speaker 0: How long can you hold your breath?

489
00:30:41,541 --> 00:30:42,123
Speaker 0: I'm curious.

490
00:30:42,143 --> 00:30:47,264
Speaker 1: I mean, the problem is I could, you know, okay, so I do a little bit of hockeying and then I come up.

491
00:30:47,626 --> 00:30:50,318
Speaker 1: It's like, how long until I can go down again?

492
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,288
Speaker 1: It's like, my time at the bottom is decreasing.

493
00:30:53,328 --> 00:30:53,930
Speaker 1: That's true.

494
00:30:53,950 --> 00:31:01,075
Speaker 0: Because you can train yourself with hypoxic training to be able to work harder with less air.

495
00:31:01,215 --> 00:31:03,163
Speaker 1: Well, doesn't that significantly shorten your life?

496
00:31:03,966 --> 00:31:05,091
Speaker 0: No, there's no evidence of that.

497
00:31:05,151 --> 00:31:05,232
Speaker 0: In

498
00:31:05,272 --> 00:31:08,643
Speaker 1: fact, people who dive for, you know, clams and so

499
00:31:08,703 --> 00:31:21,585
Speaker 0: people who do extreme diving like that, it probably is not great for their brains, but people, if you don't do that kind of stuff, you can train yourself to hold your breath, like double the time a normal person could without any significant injury, according to my physical therapist.

500
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:26,666
Speaker 0: Anyway, I'm not messing with that, but anyway, in the meta moment, the geek does book club book.

501
00:31:26,686 --> 00:31:27,650
Speaker 0: I leave the unseen.

502
00:31:28,032 --> 00:31:30,905
Speaker 0: I'm going to be out of town next week for a work trip in Germany.

503
00:31:31,367 --> 00:31:40,427
Speaker 0: So we'll either do the show the following week, which would be an off day because that's another Monday, Wednesday week, or, uh, right after I get back from a separate unrelated ski trip in Vail.

504
00:31:40,507 --> 00:31:46,972
Speaker 0: So finish, I'll leave the unseen in January because we're going to do an episode at the latest in the first part of February.

505
00:31:46,992 --> 00:31:48,055
Speaker 0: All right.

506
00:31:48,557 --> 00:31:49,400
Speaker 1: Uh, we have a forum.

507
00:31:49,561 --> 00:31:57,129
Speaker 1: We've talked about it on every episode of this show ever, basically, but, uh, I just upgraded the forum, which I do whenever there's up upgrades.

508
00:31:58,092 --> 00:32:00,700
Speaker 1: But today there was a somewhat bigger upgrade.

509
00:32:01,663 --> 00:32:08,062
Speaker 1: Uh, and so I went through all the settings on the forum and I rejiggered them all, not too much, but enough.

510
00:32:09,006 --> 00:32:13,605
Speaker 1: Uh, and now the forum is as a nude, it's got a little sidebar going on, which I think is much nicer.

511
00:32:13,645 --> 00:32:15,031
Speaker 0: I like that little sidebar.

512
00:32:15,452 --> 00:32:16,316
Speaker 1: Yeah.

513
00:32:16,336 --> 00:32:16,979
Speaker 1: So I'm like, all right.

514
00:32:16,999 --> 00:32:18,324
Speaker 1: I don't know if anyone's mad about that.

515
00:32:18,364 --> 00:32:20,150
Speaker 1: They can go kick rocks.

516
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:26,918
Speaker 0: If Twitter's got you down and you don't know how the fuck Mastodon works, because good luck actually knowing every detail.

517
00:32:26,938 --> 00:32:28,987
Speaker 1: Mastodon is not hard to describe how it works.

518
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:29,890
Speaker 1: It's just email.

519
00:32:30,011 --> 00:32:30,252
Speaker 0: Yes.

520
00:32:30,292 --> 00:32:31,396
Speaker 1: The same thing as email.

521
00:32:31,758 --> 00:32:33,524
Speaker 1: I have found understand how email works.

522
00:32:34,167 --> 00:32:40,591
Speaker 0: I have found that most of the people are saying Mastodon is complicated are just not like getting that basic concept.

523
00:32:40,612 --> 00:32:42,460
Speaker 1: You understand email, you understand Mastodon.

524
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:43,200
Speaker 1: Yup.

525
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:43,601
Speaker 0: Same thing.

526
00:32:43,702 --> 00:32:47,812
Speaker 0: Federated timeline is harder for people.

527
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:50,760
Speaker 1: Mastodon does, but it's not necessary.

528
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,121
Speaker 1: It's not.

529
00:32:51,201 --> 00:33:00,499
Speaker 0: part of what I don't understand is people are really, really butthurt about that tab, but you don't even have to look at that tab and not all the Mastodon does even have that tab.

530
00:33:01,782 --> 00:33:07,665
Speaker 1: There's a difference between the protocol that Mastodon uses and the Mastodon software and the decisions it made.

531
00:33:07,725 --> 00:33:07,885
Speaker 1: Right.

532
00:33:07,925 --> 00:33:10,254
Speaker 1: Imagine if you had email, right.

533
00:33:10,374 --> 00:33:13,365
Speaker 1: And you chose Gmail as your, your email provider.

534
00:33:14,027 --> 00:33:26,014
Speaker 1: And there was a tab in Gmail that showed you like other people's emails, other people's emails that were not emails to you or from anyone, you know, or like, or it showed you like your friends' emails to other people.

535
00:33:26,074 --> 00:33:26,637
Speaker 1: And it's like, what?

536
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,948
Speaker 1: It's like, that's how it'd be messed up.

537
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:29,169
Speaker 1: Right.

538
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:33,390
Speaker 1: It's like, just cause you're on Gmail, you're seeing all these other emails and that's Mastodon's choice.

539
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,515
Speaker 1: Gmail could do that.

540
00:33:34,695 --> 00:33:42,282
Speaker 1: Google could show you someone who could, if they wanted to, they could, they could just show you all the emails on Gmail between everybody.

541
00:33:42,302 --> 00:33:45,912
Speaker 1: Um, you know, they just choose not to,

542
00:33:46,273 --> 00:33:47,957
Speaker 0: but just saying if that's

543
00:33:48,018 --> 00:33:48,840
Speaker 1: all got you down

544
00:33:49,301 --> 00:33:57,766
Speaker 0: the geek nights forum launched before Twitter and is still going for red forums are, uh, are art that has come

545
00:33:57,806 --> 00:33:58,811
Speaker 1: and gone over the years,

546
00:33:59,193 --> 00:34:01,723
Speaker 0: but I think they do something that other things don't do.

547
00:34:02,325 --> 00:34:04,893
Speaker 0: And I would like to see a resurgence of forums again.

548
00:34:04,913 --> 00:34:05,977
Speaker 0: Yep.

549
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:11,860
Speaker 0: I like forums, forums are how, how you can type a lot of words without C C annoying all your friends.

550
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,000
Speaker 0: Hmm.

551
00:34:13,322 --> 00:34:22,219
Speaker 0: So berserker, uh, if you look at the cover, berserker is just Keanu Reeves, uh, the berserker.

552
00:34:22,902 --> 00:34:29,360
Speaker 0: And it's a comic by Keanu Reeves and about a character who is clearly played by Keanu Reeves.

553
00:34:29,981 --> 00:34:30,222
Speaker 1: Yeah.

554
00:34:30,362 --> 00:34:36,024
Speaker 1: I'm not sure how much he's actually contributed to the writing, but he's listed as a co-writer.

555
00:34:36,123 --> 00:34:37,789
Speaker 0: Yeah.

556
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:41,480
Speaker 1: The other writer is Matt Kent from, you know, what was it?

557
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,203
Speaker 1: The spy thing.

558
00:34:42,404 --> 00:34:42,625
Speaker 1: Right.

559
00:34:42,725 --> 00:34:45,960
Speaker 1: And, uh, what's the other one, the one that even had a board game.

560
00:34:46,701 --> 00:34:47,121
Speaker 0: Oh God.

561
00:34:47,943 --> 00:34:49,306
Speaker 0: Uh, I got to look at Wikipedia now.

562
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:51,129
Speaker 1: Mind MGMT.

563
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:51,650
Speaker 1: Right.

564
00:34:53,414 --> 00:34:53,694
Speaker 1: Yeah.

565
00:34:54,616 --> 00:34:57,723
Speaker 0: Pistol whip super spy super spy.

566
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:59,551
Speaker 1: That was the first time I heard of Matt Kent.

567
00:34:59,611 --> 00:35:00,153
Speaker 1: I got that.

568
00:35:00,535 --> 00:35:00,675
Speaker 1: Yeah.

569
00:35:00,735 --> 00:35:04,610
Speaker 1: And mind MGMT is the one that also had a board game and people love that.

570
00:35:05,313 --> 00:35:11,140
Speaker 1: Um, but yeah, since that super spy book that we got way long time ago, there's probably geek nights episode about that.

571
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:12,904
Speaker 1: Matt can't exploded.

572
00:35:12,924 --> 00:35:16,716
Speaker 1: So now it's Matt Kent and Keanu Reeves co-writing, right?

573
00:35:17,398 --> 00:35:21,113
Speaker 1: Uh, the artist is Ron Garney, uh, who I haven't heard of the cover.

574
00:35:21,133 --> 00:35:22,177
Speaker 1: Your artist is Raphael.

575
00:35:22,218 --> 00:35:25,146
Speaker 1: Grandpa, who I have heard of thinking and coloring bill Crabtree.

576
00:35:25,487 --> 00:35:30,120
Speaker 0: And it's just a 12 issue comic about Keanu Reeves.

577
00:35:31,022 --> 00:35:35,324
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know if there's going to be more issues maybe, but there's two volumes, two trade paperbacks.

578
00:35:35,364 --> 00:35:36,027
Speaker 1: I have both of them.

579
00:35:36,729 --> 00:35:38,898
Speaker 1: I read both of them and yeah, it's litter.

580
00:35:38,978 --> 00:35:43,137
Speaker 1: It's like, you know how much Keanu Reeves himself contributed to the writing.

581
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:45,142
Speaker 1: It's like, it's basically.

582
00:35:45,242 --> 00:35:48,893
Speaker 1: take what would have been a movie with him in it.

583
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:57,460
Speaker 1: The cliche movie you expect him to be in, but it's like exact like typecasting him and just make it a comic book instead.

584
00:35:58,481 --> 00:35:58,862
Speaker 0: Yup.

585
00:35:58,882 --> 00:36:03,956
Speaker 0: What if John Wick was 80,000 years old and actually invulnerable.

586
00:36:04,838 --> 00:36:05,099
Speaker 1: Right.

587
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:11,240
Speaker 0: But he's, he's actually invulnerable, but it's like, I mean, John, maybe John Wick is just the berserker.

588
00:36:11,381 --> 00:36:13,051
Speaker 0: Like he went through a, I'm going to be a mob hit man.

589
00:36:13,132 --> 00:36:13,937
Speaker 0: He's not invulnerable.

590
00:36:13,957 --> 00:36:14,480
Speaker 1: He's immortal.

591
00:36:14,701 --> 00:36:15,143
Speaker 1: It's different.

592
00:36:15,525 --> 00:36:17,594
Speaker 0: Well, he is both invulnerable and immortal.

593
00:36:17,915 --> 00:36:18,799
Speaker 1: He's not invulnerable.

594
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:19,702
Speaker 1: He takes lots of damage.

595
00:36:19,722 --> 00:36:21,026
Speaker 1: He just always heals all the damage.

596
00:36:22,632 --> 00:36:27,611
Speaker 1: They're very Wolverine like, but, uh, yeah, like it's like 10 X Wolverine, right?

597
00:36:27,631 --> 00:36:32,509
Speaker 1: It's like, he could be turned into like, like one cell of his body remains.

598
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:40,616
Speaker 0: It's like, I mean, there are definitely multiple arcs where Wolverine comes back from a few cells or some DNA like that is, but not this quickly.

599
00:36:40,636 --> 00:36:41,299
Speaker 0: Not quickly.

600
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:46,965
Speaker 0: I want to say the last time I saw Wolverine and already I haven't read comics in like a decade, at least X-Men comics.

601
00:36:47,367 --> 00:36:53,049
Speaker 0: The last time I remember Wolverine coming back from almost nothing was like early 2000s.

602
00:36:53,089 --> 00:36:55,698
Speaker 1: And the other thing is that Wolverine's skeleton, right?

603
00:36:55,838 --> 00:37:02,077
Speaker 1: Is like somehow always, even though, you know, the Adam, at times the metal was removed from it.

604
00:37:02,237 --> 00:37:02,558
Speaker 1: Yeah.

605
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:05,732
Speaker 0: It's still, I assume it's Wolverine adamantium right now.

606
00:37:05,752 --> 00:37:07,179
Speaker 0: I assume Wolverine is still alive.

607
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:08,504
Speaker 0: I don't know what's going on with the X-Men.

608
00:37:08,524 --> 00:37:12,300
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, it's not going to be Marvel comic books.

609
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:16,334
Speaker 1: If there's no Wolverine in any of them right now, they would, why would they do that?

610
00:37:16,816 --> 00:37:23,003
Speaker 0: So I guess the story of this, like what this is about, I've read the first volume and about a third of the second volume.

611
00:37:23,023 --> 00:37:24,089
Speaker 0: Scott's obviously read all of it.

612
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:25,356
Speaker 0: We're not going to spoil things.

613
00:37:25,436 --> 00:37:25,979
Speaker 0: It's short.

614
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:27,906
Speaker 0: Like this sounds cool to be more volumes.

615
00:37:27,966 --> 00:37:32,000
Speaker 0: It's not over, but if this sounds good, like just read it.

616
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,386
Speaker 0: Cause there's not that much of it out yet.

617
00:37:33,727 --> 00:37:34,993
Speaker 0: And it's pretty good.

618
00:37:35,033 --> 00:37:35,535
Speaker 0: And I like it.

619
00:37:35,596 --> 00:37:47,576
Speaker 0: But basically the story is just, there's this super soldier currently working for the U S government who is like a berserker, like a classical, like I am a berserker.

620
00:37:47,716 --> 00:37:48,980
Speaker 0: I go berserk and kill people.

621
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,063
Speaker 0: I'm invincible.

622
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:54,196
Speaker 0: And I have spent 80,000 years being an invincible berserker.

623
00:37:54,216 --> 00:37:55,640
Speaker 0: This is my story.

624
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:05,249
Speaker 0: We're currently at a stage where the government is studying him ostensibly to help him become mortal because that's all he wants in the world.

625
00:38:06,373 --> 00:38:11,013
Speaker 1: And really it's like, yeah, he knows, he knows that they have their own secret purposes.

626
00:38:11,114 --> 00:38:11,254
Speaker 1: Right.

627
00:38:11,295 --> 00:38:13,484
Speaker 1: But he doesn't give a shit cause he's immortal.

628
00:38:13,604 --> 00:38:19,463
Speaker 0: That's something I really like about this character is that he gives no fucks, what anyone thinks.

629
00:38:19,745 --> 00:38:20,669
Speaker 0: And he's super open.

630
00:38:20,911 --> 00:38:22,820
Speaker 0: The government's like, we're trying to help you.

631
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,368
Speaker 0: He's like, no, you aren't.

632
00:38:24,409 --> 00:38:27,202
Speaker 0: You're just trying to make a super soldier, but you know what, whatever.

633
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,747
Speaker 0: I actually don't care.

634
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:32,461
Speaker 1: Like he is just very direct and he's like, look, I don't want to die.

635
00:38:32,481 --> 00:38:33,063
Speaker 1: All right.

636
00:38:33,163 --> 00:38:34,869
Speaker 1: I just want to be able to die.

637
00:38:34,889 --> 00:38:46,430
Speaker 0: And that is a nuance that I think a lot of immortal like stories about immortals miss is the, a lot of them are either I'm an immortal who wants to die or I'm an immortal who doesn't want to die.

638
00:38:46,571 --> 00:38:48,480
Speaker 0: And there's a secret trick to kill me cause I'm evil.

639
00:38:48,962 --> 00:38:57,412
Speaker 0: You don't often see the, I don't want to die, but I would like to at least know that I could in case in the future, I get bored or for any reason.

640
00:38:57,432 --> 00:38:57,673
Speaker 1: Yeah.

641
00:38:57,814 --> 00:39:03,796
Speaker 1: I mean, he knows like, you know, it's like, he's already lived so long since caveman time.

642
00:39:03,816 --> 00:39:08,399
Speaker 0: He's probably worried that like earth will blow up in the distant future and he'll just write the sun explodes.

643
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:12,940
Speaker 1: He could just be floating out there in space, painfully suffocating repeatedly for eternity.

644
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:13,242
Speaker 1: Right.

645
00:39:13,302 --> 00:39:16,518
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, that's the kind of thing you might have to worry about.

646
00:39:16,538 --> 00:39:16,679
Speaker 1: Yeah.

647
00:39:17,402 --> 00:39:30,636
Speaker 1: So it's like, even if he's sitting there thinking, well, like, Hey, even if the U S you know, this government, you know, succeeds where, you know, Roman, whatever previous governments failed, he's like, they'll all be dead and I'll still be around and I'll do.

648
00:39:30,796 --> 00:39:32,443
Speaker 1: some other government will be here in 200 years.

649
00:39:32,483 --> 00:39:33,186
Speaker 1: What do I care?

650
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:37,805
Speaker 1: But I also like, he's like technology, he's seen all of technology advance.

651
00:39:37,825 --> 00:39:41,302
Speaker 1: He's like, Oh, maybe these people advance the technology enough that they could help me.

652
00:39:41,342 --> 00:39:42,025
Speaker 1: Let's find out.

653
00:39:42,086 --> 00:39:42,668
Speaker 1: Right.

654
00:39:43,191 --> 00:39:48,153
Speaker 1: So he's going to like, he probably tries the same thing with like blood letters and leeches hundreds of years earlier.

655
00:39:48,194 --> 00:39:48,435
Speaker 0: Yep.

656
00:39:48,455 --> 00:39:49,279
Speaker 0: Going to shamans.

657
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:54,942
Speaker 0: You definitely see in that one montage that he probably spent like a hundred years in a monastery just to see.

658
00:39:54,962 --> 00:39:55,023
Speaker 0: Yep.

659
00:39:56,488 --> 00:39:57,411
Speaker 1: Like, is this going to work?

660
00:39:57,471 --> 00:39:58,535
Speaker 1: Is this going to work?

661
00:39:58,635 --> 00:40:04,834
Speaker 0: But I guess one thing that's fun about it, uh, he is not just a humorless prick.

662
00:40:05,235 --> 00:40:10,880
Speaker 0: Like you might expect between the character design and like that description of he gives no Fox and he's immortal and he's a berserker.

663
00:40:11,502 --> 00:40:14,270
Speaker 0: He's like clearly tried everything.

664
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:17,018
Speaker 0: Like he spent time just doing nothing.

665
00:40:17,058 --> 00:40:19,428
Speaker 0: He spent time, basically he's doing nothing but having sex.

666
00:40:19,749 --> 00:40:22,080
Speaker 0: He spent time like doing every possible thing.

667
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:25,311
Speaker 0: He sort of tried everything and nothing works.

668
00:40:25,672 --> 00:40:27,540
Speaker 0: And he's just trying to figure out what to do next.

669
00:40:27,781 --> 00:40:39,382
Speaker 0: And it's just a, a moderately complex and fun take on that kind of immortal, super powerful character and the practical reality of what it would be like if you were just invincible effectively.

670
00:40:40,084 --> 00:40:40,285
Speaker 1: Yeah.

671
00:40:40,345 --> 00:40:41,609
Speaker 1: Volume two, right.

672
00:40:41,669 --> 00:40:43,976
Speaker 1: Gets into like, how did he become this way?

673
00:40:43,996 --> 00:40:49,776
Speaker 1: Uh, you know, and it's sort of nice in that I won't tell you what the explanation is, right.

674
00:40:49,876 --> 00:40:56,380
Speaker 1: But it's sort of nice in that they're not like doing the one punch man deal where it's like, Ooh, was it this?

675
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,223
Speaker 1: Was it that?

676
00:40:57,303 --> 00:40:58,187
Speaker 1: Who knows?

677
00:40:58,268 --> 00:40:58,428
Speaker 1: Right.

678
00:40:58,468 --> 00:41:00,759
Speaker 1: And they're not doing the terrible secret of space.

679
00:41:00,819 --> 00:41:03,128
Speaker 1: Like, here's a hit, but we're not going to tell you.

680
00:41:03,148 --> 00:41:06,500
Speaker 1: They're like, they're like, this is what it was.

681
00:41:06,821 --> 00:41:07,102
Speaker 1: Right.

682
00:41:07,463 --> 00:41:08,004
Speaker 1: Absolutely.

683
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:09,369
Speaker 1: This is the thing that did it.

684
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:19,221
Speaker 1: We're not going to tell you all the details of, you know, exactly how that works, but it was definitely this thing right here that made this happen.

685
00:41:19,241 --> 00:41:21,024
Speaker 1: Right.

686
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:22,608
Speaker 1: Uh, so there you go.

687
00:41:23,008 --> 00:41:37,622
Speaker 0: So, uh, if it's not obvious, this comic is hyper violence and it's sort of half of the panels are hyper violent, like intestines and blood just flying everywhere.

688
00:41:37,642 --> 00:41:42,660
Speaker 0: And the other half of the panels look like an introspective two thousands comic.

689
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:43,821
Speaker 1: Yeah.

690
00:41:43,841 --> 00:41:52,595
Speaker 1: So it's like, it's not violent the way that like each of the killer is violent where it's trying to make you cringe or be grossed out or anything like that.

691
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:52,816
Speaker 1: Right.

692
00:41:53,217 --> 00:41:56,889
Speaker 1: What it is is imagine there was an action movie, right?

693
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:08,666
Speaker 1: But when someone got shot, what happened to their body is what would happens to a body when it gets shot or cut in half with a sword, but the body just keeps moving.

694
00:42:09,108 --> 00:42:09,268
Speaker 1: Right.

695
00:42:09,288 --> 00:42:11,235
Speaker 1: But the camera doesn't move away.

696
00:42:11,637 --> 00:42:11,858
Speaker 1: Right.

697
00:42:11,898 --> 00:42:14,608
Speaker 1: They're actually drawing, you know, it's a still image.

698
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:17,038
Speaker 1: I think if this was like a movie, I'd probably get sick.

699
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:24,768
Speaker 1: Maybe I don't, even though usually fake stuff doesn't affect me, but it's like, it's a, it doesn't bother me because it's a drawing.

700
00:42:24,788 --> 00:42:25,531
Speaker 1: Right.

701
00:42:25,692 --> 00:42:31,173
Speaker 1: But it's like the camera doesn't cut away and they draw what would happen to a body somewhat.

702
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:35,870
Speaker 1: Well, he's close to what would happen to a body if that horrible thing happened to it.

703
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:37,235
Speaker 0: This is an immortal berserker.

704
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:47,468
Speaker 0: So if you were fighting, say an army of people and you are literally immortal and you know that they can't actually hurt you, like how would you fight?

705
00:42:47,689 --> 00:42:51,783
Speaker 0: And this kind of leans into what that might look like pretty hard.

706
00:42:52,325 --> 00:42:52,526
Speaker 1: Yeah.

707
00:42:52,546 --> 00:42:53,490
Speaker 1: He's like, he gets shot.

708
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:54,293
Speaker 1: He keeps going.

709
00:42:54,334 --> 00:42:55,518
Speaker 1: He gets a sword in him.

710
00:42:55,558 --> 00:42:56,261
Speaker 1: He gets his arm cut.

711
00:42:56,281 --> 00:43:03,809
Speaker 0: There's one scene where someone has a grenade and he just like grabs the grenade and just holds it in front of the guy and just waits for it to go off.

712
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:11,802
Speaker 1: Like, yeah, that's, you know, that's the kind of thing, you know, you have this core concept and it's like, Hey, how can we play around with this?

713
00:43:11,883 --> 00:43:12,043
Speaker 1: Right.

714
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:13,909
Speaker 1: What stuff can we make happen?

715
00:43:13,929 --> 00:43:17,078
Speaker 1: You know, even that core conceit.

716
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,914
Speaker 0: And there's a bunch of characters and they're all like interesting enough.

717
00:43:21,296 --> 00:43:23,586
Speaker 0: Like it doesn't really zoom in on a lot of the characters.

718
00:43:23,606 --> 00:43:27,122
Speaker 0: It seems like it mostly zooms in on him, the researchers working with him.

719
00:43:27,182 --> 00:43:34,835
Speaker 1: I think it's, I think that's on purpose that a lot, you know, the only really characters to get any time are like, you know, the therapist and the scientist, right.

720
00:43:35,597 --> 00:43:38,287
Speaker 0: Or people in his backstory, but even they aren't around long.

721
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:43,966
Speaker 1: Well, there'll be some backstory people, you know, from you know, origin story.

722
00:43:43,986 --> 00:43:45,070
Speaker 1: that gets a lot of time.

723
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:45,351
Speaker 1: Right.

724
00:43:45,411 --> 00:43:53,669
Speaker 1: But it's like, I think that's on purpose and it actually normally I'd complain and be like, ah, there aren't any other really cool characters other than the one guy.

725
00:43:53,729 --> 00:43:53,930
Speaker 1: Right.

726
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:55,195
Speaker 1: But it makes sense.

727
00:43:55,235 --> 00:44:01,398
Speaker 1: Like being an immortal guy, anyone else in all of history is basically insignificant from his eyes.

728
00:44:01,498 --> 00:44:01,639
Speaker 1: Right.

729
00:44:01,659 --> 00:44:03,208
Speaker 1: It's like, there'll be around for like two seconds.

730
00:44:03,228 --> 00:44:04,214
Speaker 0: Like who do you pay attention to?

731
00:44:04,234 --> 00:44:15,240
Speaker 0: the handful of people who are heavily involved in your biz right now, or the handful of people who are so memorable that they stand out in 80,000 years of being a human running around being a berserker.

732
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:16,201
Speaker 1: Right.

733
00:44:16,462 --> 00:44:26,067
Speaker 1: Like Eve, let's say in, I don't know, some ancient time, say like, I don't know, Sumer in ancient Sumer, right.

734
00:44:26,107 --> 00:44:29,900
Speaker 1: He was hanging out and he had a, he had a best friend at that time.

735
00:44:30,181 --> 00:44:33,657
Speaker 1: I just making something up, but it's like, and that was like their best friend for 80 years.

736
00:44:34,701 --> 00:44:45,320
Speaker 1: And from like befriended them as a child and they died old and he's still just this dude, the whole time he was a middle-aged dude for the 80 years of this other person's life.

737
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,773
Speaker 1: That's a long time to live in an ancient time.

738
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:48,055
Speaker 1: Right.

739
00:44:48,377 --> 00:44:53,676
Speaker 1: It's like, it's like that person would be like barely a footnote in this dude's life.

740
00:44:54,138 --> 00:44:54,981
Speaker 1: So like, Yup.

741
00:44:55,424 --> 00:44:55,625
Speaker 0: Right.

742
00:44:55,645 --> 00:44:58,000
Speaker 0: Well, think about, think about how many awesome people you've met.

743
00:44:58,401 --> 00:44:59,685
Speaker 0: Either of us have met in our lives.

744
00:44:59,725 --> 00:45:04,139
Speaker 0: We live about 40 years, maybe 20, like 30 of those.

745
00:45:04,179 --> 00:45:07,330
Speaker 0: We were mostly sentient, like 30, 35.

746
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,056
Speaker 0: How many cool people have we met now?

747
00:45:09,156 --> 00:45:15,333
Speaker 0: extrapolate how many cool people who are just as cooler or as cool or cooler that we would meet in 80,000 years.

748
00:45:15,373 --> 00:45:15,534
Speaker 0: Right.

749
00:45:15,574 --> 00:45:24,382
Speaker 1: So the book is sort of mirroring his own feelings of like, none of these other people are, are of any significance.

750
00:45:24,402 --> 00:45:27,092
Speaker 1: So we're only going to spend time on them.

751
00:45:27,192 --> 00:45:35,479
Speaker 1: as much as their significance is, you know, makes them worthy of being on the page, getting any character development or anything like that.

752
00:45:36,062 --> 00:45:40,120
Speaker 0: But the character, like he is, he's more complex and nuanced than you might expect.

753
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,185
Speaker 0: His he's not evil.

754
00:45:42,225 --> 00:45:43,670
Speaker 0: Like he's not malicious.

755
00:45:43,972 --> 00:45:48,307
Speaker 0: He's just kind of like, he's seen everything and he's kind of mostly done with stuff.

756
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:49,171
Speaker 1: Yeah.

757
00:45:49,211 --> 00:45:51,199
Speaker 1: He might've had an evil time, you know?

758
00:45:51,219 --> 00:45:53,507
Speaker 1: Oh, let me try being an evil dictator one time.

759
00:45:54,109 --> 00:45:54,892
Speaker 1: Let me know.

760
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:59,008
Speaker 1: But that time isn't at least the present, as far as the book is concerned.

761
00:45:59,028 --> 00:46:06,057
Speaker 1: Like when the therapist comes over to his house, he's just like, I mean, I guess he's kind of evil doing like, you know, military, you know, whatever, but.

762
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:11,298
Speaker 0: But when she comes over, like he's still like, he has, he drinks some scotch and hangs out.

763
00:46:11,338 --> 00:46:13,125
Speaker 0: Like he still lives his life.

764
00:46:13,446 --> 00:46:15,212
Speaker 0: It's not like to that extreme.

765
00:46:15,894 --> 00:46:21,277
Speaker 0: And it's honestly, it's a pretty compelling concept, especially because it's not that long so far.

766
00:46:21,317 --> 00:46:23,769
Speaker 0: And I don't know how long it's going to be, but I've enjoyed it.

767
00:46:23,809 --> 00:46:24,774
Speaker 0: I'm going to read volume two.

768
00:46:25,056 --> 00:46:26,341
Speaker 0: And if there's more, I'll keep reading it.

769
00:46:27,204 --> 00:46:27,445
Speaker 1: Yeah.

770
00:46:27,546 --> 00:46:33,846
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, they think the, the, uh, the effort to read this compared to what it is, right.

771
00:46:34,087 --> 00:46:35,511
Speaker 1: Makes it a good value.

772
00:46:35,531 --> 00:46:36,253
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

773
00:46:36,273 --> 00:46:42,192
Speaker 1: I don't think it's like Eisner award winning worthy or anything like that, but you'll get more.

774
00:46:42,272 --> 00:46:53,229
Speaker 0: Imagine if you want a Wolverine ish story and you don't want to figure out what Wolverine to read right now, this is almost like a mainlining, a take on Wolverine played by Keanu Reeves.

775
00:46:55,876 --> 00:47:02,583
Speaker 1: I don't know if it'll like, um, it's, it's a, it's an interesting thing to think about if someone's going to make like an adaptation of this.

776
00:47:02,684 --> 00:47:02,885
Speaker 1: Right.

777
00:47:02,905 --> 00:47:05,696
Speaker 1: Cause it's like, well, I saw like a whole point of this.

778
00:47:06,017 --> 00:47:16,660
Speaker 0: I saw some talk that Keanu actually said he wanted it to be a comic because he wanted to do a kind of story that's hard to tell in a traditional movie, like having those juxtapositions with the panels.

779
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:17,981
Speaker 1: Yeah.

780
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:27,674
Speaker 1: But it's almost like, you know, the dude could already as, or has already made at least two or three, many movies that are basically right along this line.

781
00:47:27,734 --> 00:47:27,975
Speaker 1: Yup.

782
00:47:28,216 --> 00:47:28,477
Speaker 1: Right.

783
00:47:28,858 --> 00:47:31,891
Speaker 1: So it's like, you could have just gone directly to movie.

784
00:47:31,931 --> 00:47:39,944
Speaker 1: It's like the fact that he went to comic instead, it makes it seem like this isn't one of those plays where you make the comic to make the move to sell the movie up.

785
00:47:40,467 --> 00:47:43,340
Speaker 1: It's like, it seems like they just wanted to make the comic.

786
00:47:43,741 --> 00:47:44,002
Speaker 1: Right.

787
00:47:44,022 --> 00:47:51,012
Speaker 0: And then Keanu Reeves went to a studio and said, took this as a script and said, I want to make this movie and star in it.

788
00:47:51,072 --> 00:47:52,802
Speaker 0: They would said, yes, they would say yes, please.

789
00:47:53,083 --> 00:47:55,114
Speaker 0: And they would get funding cause it would definitely make money.

790
00:47:55,174 --> 00:47:55,958
Speaker 0: Like they would just do it.

791
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,061
Speaker 1: Yeah.

792
00:47:57,604 --> 00:48:00,135
Speaker 1: So it's like, I think it's going to be comic only.

793
00:48:00,195 --> 00:48:05,173
Speaker 1: It's like, Hey, you know, you got one of those, you know, I think every person in the movie biz, right.

794
00:48:05,234 --> 00:48:10,675
Speaker 1: Sorta has a huge pile of scripts and ideas and things that didn't get released.

795
00:48:10,735 --> 00:48:18,020
Speaker 1: And when I, you know, things that, probably like maybe a hundred movies die in some fashion in order for one to actually get made.

796
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:18,661
Speaker 1: Right.

797
00:48:18,681 --> 00:48:26,027
Speaker 1: So this is just, you know, what way to take one of those hundreds and put it into the world somehow in a published form.

798
00:48:26,047 --> 00:48:26,509
Speaker 1: Right.

799
00:48:26,971 --> 00:48:33,982
Speaker 0: But I love this, this note from this interview with Keanu, cause the way the interviewer is like, I couldn't help, but think a lot about Wolverine long.

800
00:48:34,022 --> 00:48:35,951
Speaker 0: Like, were you thinking about Wolverine?

801
00:48:36,072 --> 00:48:40,352
Speaker 0: And he started Keanu Reeves response with, I mean, for me, it's one of my favorite characters.

802
00:48:40,593 --> 00:48:41,879
Speaker 0: that a strong influence on me.

803
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:45,600
Speaker 0: It's impacted me, but we're also stepping into werewolves and vampires.

804
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:47,681
Speaker 1: Yup.

805
00:48:48,985 --> 00:48:57,713
Speaker 1: So I do think that if there's any chance of adaptation, it would be like, uh, like an animated Netflix dealy kind of, you know, you could do something cool with.

806
00:48:57,773 --> 00:48:58,576
Speaker 0: it could happen.

807
00:48:59,319 --> 00:49:03,074
Speaker 0: You can, or I could see, you know, the tie in video game.

808
00:49:03,094 --> 00:49:04,479
Speaker 0: There's a lot of other ways they could go.

809
00:49:04,539 --> 00:49:08,593
Speaker 0: if they wanted to like have adjacent properties, the video game would be like Wario.

810
00:49:08,634 --> 00:49:08,915
Speaker 1: You can't.

811
00:49:08,935 --> 00:49:09,055
Speaker 1: Wow.

812
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:11,021
Speaker 0: Yeah.

813
00:49:11,121 --> 00:49:17,119
Speaker 0: It's just make it like a dynasty warriors, but you can't, you literally just can't die.

814
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,731
Speaker 0: And it's Wario like up the Chinese empire collapse.

815
00:49:20,811 --> 00:49:23,078
Speaker 1: No, the whole, your goal is to die.

816
00:49:23,279 --> 00:49:23,560
Speaker 0: Yeah.

817
00:49:25,581 --> 00:49:26,405
Speaker 1: Try to die.

818
00:49:26,425 --> 00:49:27,148
Speaker 1: All right.

819
00:49:27,188 --> 00:49:28,634
Speaker 1: Well, all these guys are attacking you.

820
00:49:28,915 --> 00:49:29,899
Speaker 1: Well, I'm trying to die.

821
00:49:29,919 --> 00:49:30,321
Speaker 1: I'll let you know.

822
00:49:30,401 --> 00:49:31,104
Speaker 1: I'd make it.

823
00:49:31,124 --> 00:49:32,028
Speaker 1: You can't tell you.

824
00:49:32,048 --> 00:49:35,442
Speaker 0: And if you quit the game, it ostensibly just keeps running.

825
00:49:35,703 --> 00:49:40,103
Speaker 0: And when you come back, you're just laying there dead and you reform and like the clock has just moved forward.

826
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:44,275
Speaker 1: You can't fast forward when you're reforming.

827
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,630
Speaker 0: Maybe you're going to click a button to be reformed.

828
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:49,674
Speaker 0: Like when is the next point?

829
00:49:49,714 --> 00:49:50,517
Speaker 0: I'll be reformed.

830
00:49:51,159 --> 00:49:51,259
Speaker 1: Yeah.

831
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:53,448
Speaker 1: It's come back in 12 hours and we can play.

832
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:58,588
Speaker 1: If you ever click that button and you know, you have to keep the game running for the 12 hours.

833
00:49:59,431 --> 00:50:00,474
Speaker 0: Just make it one of those idlers.

834
00:50:00,574 --> 00:50:03,283
Speaker 0: It's just him killing people and you just wait.

835
00:50:03,544 --> 00:50:04,426
Speaker 0: You just get a kill count.

836
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:06,492
Speaker 1: Oh, it never ends.

837
00:50:07,034 --> 00:50:07,215
Speaker 1: I don't.

838
00:50:08,198 --> 00:50:11,522
Speaker 1: Number goes up and history progresses like civilization.

839
00:50:18,208 --> 00:50:20,710
Speaker 0: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
