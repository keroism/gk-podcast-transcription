1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,790
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, February 21st, and this is Geek Nights.

2
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:24,870
Speaker 1: Tonight we were going to begin our coverage of Katsucon with video gaming, but I fucked up the podcast by accidentally overwriting the second 40 minutes of it due to an issue with Audacity.

3
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,588
Speaker 1: Let's do this!

4
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,184
Speaker 1: So it's gaming day, and I'm still a little sick.

5
00:00:30,244 --> 00:00:31,630
Speaker 1: Hopefully I'll be good by tomorrow.

6
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,369
Speaker 1: Katsucon really kind of wore me out.

7
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:34,610
Speaker 0: Bargo bargo bargo bargo.

8
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:47,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, but today we're going to talk about, well, a couple of video game news and such, and then I'm going to do the first half of my Katsucon coverage, which will basically just include the video gaming aspects of Katsucon.

9
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,530
Speaker 0: That's an anime con, so how big could the video gaming be?

10
00:00:51,435 --> 00:00:53,150
Speaker 1: I've got a lot to say about the video gaming.

11
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:58,450
Speaker 0: Because usually we go to the anime cons and they have video game rooms, but we mostly stay away from them.

12
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,830
Speaker 1: Well, the thing about Katsucon is that it's a 24 hour hotel con.

13
00:01:02,614 --> 00:01:05,870
Speaker 0: Oh, it's 24 hours, there's nothing much to do at night except play video games.

14
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,189
Speaker 1: There's a lot of mad four in the morning playing Guitar Heroes with drunk guys.

15
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,290
Speaker 0: There was Guitar Heroes at the UberCon also.

16
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,429
Speaker 1: Yep, but I'll get to all that in due time.

17
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,083
Speaker 1: I think we should start to get in on that.

18
00:01:18,071 --> 00:01:24,970
Speaker 1: First off, I would like to note that not a half hour ago, I beat Scott at both Through the Desert and Citadels.

19
00:01:25,756 --> 00:01:26,070
Speaker 0: Cheated.

20
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:27,789
Speaker 1: Quite handily, in fact.

21
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:31,550
Speaker 0: Nah, you only beat me by a little bit in the stupid camel game.

22
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:35,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, well you said you won until we recounted your points and discovered that you actually lost.

23
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,674
Speaker 0: I counted wrong.

24
00:01:38,377 --> 00:01:40,749
Speaker 0: Who knows, I might have accidentally put some points back in the...

25
00:01:41,091 --> 00:01:42,549
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what, Bush counted wrong too.

26
00:01:43,553 --> 00:01:43,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, he did.

27
00:01:45,311 --> 00:01:50,830
Speaker 1: And as for Citadels, we've talked about the game before, but basically, I'm not so proud of the fact that I won.

28
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,150
Speaker 1: I'm proud of the fact that my trash talk was the epitome of good trash talk.

29
00:01:56,732 --> 00:02:01,130
Speaker 1: And I dragged it out as long as you can possibly drag it out, to the point that I'm still dragging it out.

30
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:02,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, you are.

31
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:07,070
Speaker 1: Because you see, there was a point in the game where the assassin goes before the thief.

32
00:02:07,651 --> 00:02:10,930
Speaker 1: And the assassin can kill any character, and the thief can steal from any character.

33
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,398
Speaker 1: Now, I had a pile of money.

34
00:02:13,418 --> 00:02:15,908
Speaker 1: I had all this money sitting in front of me.

35
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,694
Speaker 1: And Scott knew.

36
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:20,863
Speaker 1: Well, he took the thief.

37
00:02:21,365 --> 00:02:22,690
Speaker 1: It was obvious that he took the thief.

38
00:02:23,212 --> 00:02:24,629
Speaker 1: I knew he had the thief in his hand.

39
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:29,669
Speaker 1: He gave me all the cards to pick from, and the assassin was also still in there.

40
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:36,370
Speaker 1: So I took the assassin, knowing that Scott was the thief, and that I had a lot of money that could be stolen.

41
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:44,190
Speaker 1: So, I played the assassin, I immediately assassinated the thief, and Scott about cried.

42
00:02:44,991 --> 00:02:47,680
Speaker 0: The worst thing was that he started out as the king.

43
00:02:48,282 --> 00:02:49,406
Speaker 0: And at first, that was great.

44
00:02:49,486 --> 00:02:50,490
Speaker 0: I loved it when he was the king.

45
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,410
Speaker 0: And I was doing good, and it was all great.

46
00:02:53,932 --> 00:02:58,270
Speaker 0: But then, I wanted to be the king, but I couldn't be the king because he never gave me the king.

47
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,977
Speaker 0: He kept discarding it, randomly.

48
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:02,670
Speaker 0: But always the same one, so not so randomly.

49
00:03:03,531 --> 00:03:05,809
Speaker 0: And then I finally got to be the king, and it was terrible.

50
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,809
Speaker 0: And the worst thing was that when he was the king, he always assassinated me.

51
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,169
Speaker 0: And then when I finally became the king, he always assassinated me.

52
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:25,370
Speaker 1: See, Citadel is mostly a game of, you know in A Princess Bride when they got the poison in one cup or the other cup, and, well, you would have put the poison in this cup, but that would mean blah, so therefore it's in this cup, but blah, so it's in this cup.

53
00:03:25,671 --> 00:03:26,769
Speaker 0: That's exactly what this game is.

54
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,410
Speaker 1: It's a game like that, except I'm better at that game than Scott is.

55
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,209
Speaker 0: Well, at least in the two-player game, that's what it is.

56
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:37,210
Speaker 0: In the four-player or more game, it's definitely not, it's no longer a game of which cup is the poison in.

57
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,229
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a good party game.

58
00:03:38,457 --> 00:03:38,542
Speaker 0: Yeah.

59
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:44,668
Speaker 1: But, basically, I'm real good at bluffing, and Scott's real good at getting bluffed, so...

60
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:56,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, I try to win the game by good strategy of selection, so that where it doesn't matter if I bluff or not, is that my raw choices, I always get to do the right thing and I get ahead.

61
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:03,110
Speaker 0: You know, but sometimes I get, like today I lost because I didn't draw cards of the right colors to build.

62
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,638
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

63
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:06,069
Speaker 1: You lost because you suck.

64
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:06,708
Speaker 0: You suck.

65
00:04:07,191 --> 00:04:09,118
Speaker 1: I mean, I won by so much.

66
00:04:09,138 --> 00:04:12,210
Speaker 1: I could have given you cards to build for free and I still would have won.

67
00:04:12,734 --> 00:04:14,810
Speaker 0: No, if you would have given me cards, I would have done much better.

68
00:04:16,051 --> 00:04:18,601
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway, we've got some actual news here, so...

69
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:24,470
Speaker 0: Well, first of all, you might be fans of Phoenix, right?

70
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:25,533
Speaker 1: Objection!

71
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:27,030
Speaker 1: Phoenix Wright sucks.

72
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:29,909
Speaker 0: Alright, I guess you have to give it back to me then.

73
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,943
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually I'm almost done with it.

74
00:04:31,984 --> 00:04:32,810
Speaker 1: That game's frickin' awesome.

75
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:42,009
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you're not a fan of Phoenix Wright, well, if you didn't see yesterday's Thing of the Day, you have to go buy a DS right now and play it.

76
00:04:42,592 --> 00:04:44,250
Speaker 0: If you can find the game, it's sold out everywhere.

77
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,809
Speaker 1: Yep, our friend Scott, who was at Kotchacon with me, really wants to play it.

78
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:49,277
Speaker 1: And he can't find it.

79
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:50,243
Speaker 1: He's willing to pay money.

80
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:51,169
Speaker 1: No one has it.

81
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,039
Speaker 0: It goes on eBay for 50 bucks.

82
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,145
Speaker 0: This is a $30 Nintendo DS game.

83
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:56,830
Speaker 1: That's been out for a while.

84
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,922
Speaker 0: I got it the day it came out because I was smart.

85
00:04:59,868 --> 00:05:00,270
Speaker 0: Real smart.

86
00:05:00,471 --> 00:05:01,909
Speaker 1: It's one hell of a game, I gotta tell ya.

87
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,160
Speaker 0: So anyway, it's really just Carmen Sandiego.

88
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,970
Speaker 0: We talked about it before, there's an episode about it.

89
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:06,547
Speaker 0: Go look for it.

90
00:05:06,831 --> 00:05:09,129
Speaker 1: It's also been at least one Thing of the Day, if not two.

91
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:10,981
Speaker 0: I think three, even.

92
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:11,889
Speaker 0: Anyway.

93
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:19,150
Speaker 0: So, in Japan, there are three GBA games of Phoenix Wright.

94
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:24,090
Speaker 0: And they each contain four episodes of court drama.

95
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:28,043
Speaker 0: There is a fourth game that is the DS game.

96
00:05:28,404 --> 00:05:29,750
Speaker 0: That is the one we have in America.

97
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:35,347
Speaker 0: The DS game consists of... I think it's the first or the third.

98
00:05:35,387 --> 00:05:36,230
Speaker 0: I'm not sure which one.

99
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,859
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're not sure.

100
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:37,609
Speaker 1: Don't worry about it.

101
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,323
Speaker 0: It's either the first GBA game or the third GBA game.

102
00:05:41,403 --> 00:05:42,307
Speaker 0: I'm not sure which.

103
00:05:42,507 --> 00:05:43,190
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

104
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,150
Speaker 0: Because it's translated to English and it makes sense.

105
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:55,270
Speaker 0: Then they took that GBA game and they added a special extra fifth DS episode that uses advanced DS features.

106
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,909
Speaker 0: And it's like the best episode.

107
00:05:57,451 --> 00:06:00,390
Speaker 1: It's also called Rise from the Ashes.

108
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:05,190
Speaker 1: Your name is Phoenix Wright, so make whatever illusions you will.

109
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,917
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that's the fifth episode.

110
00:06:06,957 --> 00:06:08,625
Speaker 0: that's special in the DS version.

111
00:06:08,665 --> 00:06:09,850
Speaker 0: that is in America and Japan.

112
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:24,930
Speaker 0: The news about Phoenix Wright is that Capcom has announced that in America, they're releasing all the rest of the Phoenix Wright that we didn't get in English for cellular phones.

113
00:06:26,551 --> 00:06:30,890
Speaker 0: As in, not your... you know, they didn't say they're not going to put out a GBA and they're not going to put out a DS.

114
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:34,150
Speaker 0: They said they are going to put out cell phone versions.

115
00:06:34,571 --> 00:06:40,590
Speaker 1: Now, in the article I saw, it showed a picture of a little Phoenix Wright cartridge stuck into a special slot on a phone.

116
00:06:41,113 --> 00:06:41,848
Speaker 0: Oh, is that what you saw?

117
00:06:42,211 --> 00:06:43,550
Speaker 1: That's the picture I saw in the article I read.

118
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,470
Speaker 0: Because it's for the N-Gage, that's whatever.

119
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:54,750
Speaker 0: No, but my cell phone, you know, I don't use any of the fancy stuff on the cell phone from Verizon because it all is a rip-off in its price.

120
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,910
Speaker 0: Like, I can pay five bucks to get Galaga and stuff.

121
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:05,330
Speaker 0: But if I look through there a couple times to see what, you know, goes on, and there's some fancy freaking awesome games in there.

122
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:13,710
Speaker 0: Like, I could play Diner Dash, Splinter Cell, Baseball, all kinds of, like, official real games are in there.

123
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,044
Speaker 1: Yeah, my cell phone can play, like, Galaga, Ms.

124
00:07:17,065 --> 00:07:18,230
Speaker 0: Pac-Man, and that's about it.

125
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:18,712
Speaker 0: I could play Ms.

126
00:07:18,732 --> 00:07:18,873
Speaker 0: Pac-Man.

127
00:07:19,115 --> 00:07:20,684
Speaker 0: There's so many... I'll show it to you sometime.

128
00:07:20,724 --> 00:07:21,770
Speaker 0: I'll show it to you after the podcast.

129
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,148
Speaker 1: See, I'm not that interested because I got a DS.

130
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:24,306
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but...

131
00:07:24,551 --> 00:07:26,289
Speaker 1: And I carry it around and play DS games on it.

132
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:30,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do too, but the point is, is that the cell phone has a lot of cool games.

133
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,870
Speaker 0: I don't want to play any of them because they cost five bucks.

134
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:37,190
Speaker 0: But, if there are Phoenix Wright episodes for five bucks each, right?

135
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,770
Speaker 0: Normally, I would pay thirty dollars for four episodes of Phoenix Wright.

136
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:49,010
Speaker 0: Even if they charge five dollars an episode, which is the most I've ever seen anything go for on the cell phone is five bucks for one game.

137
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,930
Speaker 0: That would be twenty bucks for four episodes of Phoenix Wright.

138
00:07:53,271 --> 00:07:54,735
Speaker 0: Now, that is a deal.

139
00:07:54,755 --> 00:07:57,704
Speaker 0: And Phoenix Wright can be played on a cell phone just fine.

140
00:07:57,784 --> 00:07:59,750
Speaker 0: It doesn't need a whole Game Boy or a whole DS.

141
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:03,802
Speaker 0: So, if I see that on my cell phone, I'm going to get it.

142
00:08:03,822 --> 00:08:06,230
Speaker 0: There's no, you know, it can't be sold out.

143
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:10,290
Speaker 1: Now, the big question is going to be if it comes out on the DS as well, which it had better.

144
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:14,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if it, you know, which cell phone is it going to come out for?

145
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:18,870
Speaker 0: My cell phone seems to get a lot of games, and I'm on Verizon with the Get It Now service.

146
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:20,096
Speaker 0: But, who knows?

147
00:08:20,156 --> 00:08:22,250
Speaker 0: It might come out for some other kind of phone.

148
00:08:22,331 --> 00:08:23,930
Speaker 1: Watch, it'll be an N-Gage exclusive.

149
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:25,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, that'd be hilarious.

150
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:26,436
Speaker 1: You know what?

151
00:08:26,456 --> 00:08:27,126
Speaker 1: That would probably...

152
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,870
Speaker 0: I would go pick up an N-Gage for cheap.

153
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:33,830
Speaker 1: I'll bet it would at least quadruple N-Gage sales.

154
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:35,808
Speaker 0: I think it would, actually.

155
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:37,869
Speaker 1: So, they'd sell, you know, four of them.

156
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:43,510
Speaker 0: See, that shows you that all a system needs to be successful is good games that people want.

157
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:48,090
Speaker 0: That's all, you know, it has nothing to do with the hardware, the higher end, that's bullshit.

158
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:48,894
Speaker 1: Well, you know what?

159
00:08:49,316 --> 00:08:52,390
Speaker 1: I have a lot to say about that when I end up talking about Katsu-Kan.

160
00:08:53,131 --> 00:08:59,949
Speaker 1: Because the main thing, and video game-wise, that I want to talk about is that they encourage people to bring their DSs and PSPs.

161
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,510
Speaker 1: And one of those two appeared in great number.

162
00:09:04,271 --> 00:09:08,950
Speaker 1: And the other one, I can only verify that there were at least two with the Kan, I think.

163
00:09:09,613 --> 00:09:11,770
Speaker 0: I think everyone's already guessed, but anyway.

164
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, it might have been the same guy I ran into twice, because I was a little drunk the second time.

165
00:09:16,912 --> 00:09:18,849
Speaker 1: I'm not kidding, it really might have been the same guy, I don't know.

166
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:26,790
Speaker 0: Alright, so, the other bit of news besides Phoenix Wright on cellular phones is actually something, again, from World of Warcraft.

167
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,469
Speaker 0: Why does World of Warcraft make all this news?

168
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:31,390
Speaker 1: Because it's the big game that a lot of people play.

169
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess.

170
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:38,789
Speaker 1: I mean, it's popular, like, I'm not going to date myself, so I'm not even going to bother saying anything, but it's that game now.

171
00:09:39,931 --> 00:09:42,309
Speaker 1: It's that game, you know, that game, everyone's playing it.

172
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,148
Speaker 0: Except us, we don't like it.

173
00:09:44,633 --> 00:09:45,868
Speaker 1: Yeah, in fact, I kind of hate it.

174
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:49,169
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't like what it stands for, or anything about it.

175
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:54,670
Speaker 0: I don't like MMORPGs, just current ones, the whole leveling up idea.

176
00:09:55,170 --> 00:10:00,310
Speaker 1: I like the idea of massively multiplayer, and I like the idea of massive multiplayer role-playing games.

177
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:04,250
Speaker 1: I don't think that any MMO out there is really a role-playing game.

178
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:08,190
Speaker 0: It's just a leveling up game, which seems to be what role-playing games are connected to.

179
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:13,050
Speaker 1: I mean, they're differentiated by server now, and we'll do a whole show on it.

180
00:10:13,294 --> 00:10:13,907
Speaker 1: They take me off.

181
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:18,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, ooh, we should do a show on why World of Warcraft and all the other stuff.

182
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,809
Speaker 1: Maybe next Wednesday.

183
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:20,585
Speaker 0: Maybe.

184
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:30,165
Speaker 0: Anyway, so, there is a cool news from World of Warcraft, which is not quite as cool as Leeroy Jenkins, but apparently... Leeroy Jenkins!

185
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:38,490
Speaker 0: Anyway, on World of Warcraft, each server has, like, these areas that have to open up.

186
00:10:39,131 --> 00:10:47,330
Speaker 0: So, imagine if there's, like, some door in a building somewhere, and no one in the game can go through the door until someone unlocks it.

187
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,890
Speaker 0: So if anyone unlocks the door, everyone else can go through now.

188
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:55,650
Speaker 1: And to unlock it, you basically have to put a huge amount of time and resources together.

189
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,449
Speaker 1: Really, it's only something a guild could do.

190
00:10:57,852 --> 00:11:00,330
Speaker 1: Like a powerful guild, and build this scepter.

191
00:11:00,571 --> 00:11:14,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, so, basically there's a gong, and if you hit this gong with a magic scepter that is not easy to get, you have to spend a lot of time and money to build it, then this gate will open and allow everyone on the whole server to go into this area.

192
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:23,210
Speaker 0: So basically, until someone does this, the entire server is missing out on a large part of the game that other servers are experiencing.

193
00:11:24,611 --> 00:11:30,470
Speaker 0: So what happened is, usually people on servers know what's going on, because lots of communication and whatever.

194
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:35,350
Speaker 0: If no one's built the scepter yet, usually one guild starts to build it.

195
00:11:35,991 --> 00:11:39,610
Speaker 0: And then no one else bothers to, because, well, they're building it.

196
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,450
Speaker 0: Why should, you know, we bother, you know?

197
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,037
Speaker 0: There's no point in us both building it.

198
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:45,630
Speaker 0: We'll build something else to open some other gate, or who knows?

199
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,536
Speaker 0: I don't know how it works.

200
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,510
Speaker 0: I'm just reading articles online.

201
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:56,869
Speaker 1: So this one guild built the thing, and instead of using it, they're standing there with it saying, "Give us 5,000 gold or we're not banging

202
00:11:56,929 --> 00:11:56,969
Speaker 1: it.".

203
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:58,829
Speaker 0: I think that's awesome.

204
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:08,669
Speaker 1: Yeah, I really hope that the World of Warcraft people let this play out as it does in the game, instead of fiat-ing some sort of, "Screw you guys, we're going to let them open it

205
00:12:08,749 --> 00:12:09,070
Speaker 1: anyway.".

206
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:27,290
Speaker 0: Well, actually, according to some things I've read, is that no matter what you do, because in some servers people didn't even know what to do for the stupid scepter, if you wait long enough, so when the server just, you know, has been in existence long enough, the gate will just open on its own, but it takes quite a while.

207
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:31,750
Speaker 0: And I don't think it's opened yet, so these people are basically holding the server hostage.

208
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:37,508
Speaker 0: You know, their choices are, "Give these people 5,000 gold and get it open right

209
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:37,809
Speaker 0: now."

210
00:12:39,652 --> 00:12:45,290
Speaker 0: Or, "Build the scepter themselves," which is a huge pain in the ass, and probably by the time they do that, it'll open anyway.

211
00:12:46,072 --> 00:12:46,494
Speaker 0: Who knows?

212
00:12:47,682 --> 00:12:48,870
Speaker 0: So, that's just awesome.

213
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,839
Speaker 1: So, more power to the guys who are doing this.

214
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,569
Speaker 1: That's the kind of stuff I like to see in an MMO.

215
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:58,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, too bad, like, you know, these things are so rare that they make news and they're not everyday occurrences.

216
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:03,430
Speaker 0: When they're everyday occurrences, that's the game I'm playing, where that kind of shit happens every five minutes.

217
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:06,547
Speaker 0: People screwing people over and blah blah blah, you know.

218
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:09,309
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what it's about.

219
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:18,740
Speaker 1: And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

220
00:13:19,042 --> 00:13:21,399

Speaker 0: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
