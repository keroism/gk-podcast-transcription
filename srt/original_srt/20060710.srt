1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:17,819
Speaker 0: It's Monday July 10th, and this is geek nights tonight part 3 of our continuing series, and how a computer works the flip-flop.

2
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:20,078
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

3
00:00:21,201 --> 00:00:24,090
Speaker 1: So we've said this almost every Monday, but we're saying it again.

4
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:29,946
Speaker 1: We're back from a crazy weekend yet another Convention over yep.

5
00:00:30,006 --> 00:00:35,320
Speaker 0: this time we were at Connecticut for Saturday only and apparently someone thought we were gonna be there all three days.

6
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,306
Speaker 0: I don't remember saying that.

7
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:37,211
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure.

8
00:00:37,251 --> 00:00:38,680
Speaker 1: we said we were only gonna be there Saturday.

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:57,820
Speaker 1: And even if that weren't the case I submit to you who goes to a convention just on Sunday especially a convention that cost as much as, Connecticut and Who makes four podcasts a week and has time to go to a whole mess of conventions for full weekends?

10
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,448
Speaker 1: The thing is I would have stayed the whole weekend.

11
00:01:00,508 --> 00:01:01,653
Speaker 1: I just didn't have a ride home.

12
00:01:01,673 --> 00:01:04,986
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Wouldn't have stayed the whole weekend.

13
00:01:05,007 --> 00:01:07,739
Speaker 0: You know why it was much much cheaper.

14
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:11,817
Speaker 1: and Yeah, I would have because I was there anyway, and I would have just hung out.

15
00:01:12,199 --> 00:01:13,827
Speaker 0: well We'll talk about it on Wednesday.

16
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:24,067
Speaker 1: Yeah, we have quite a bit to say about Connecticut and One thing we will say I know we have a lot of new listeners because we met a lot of cool people at Connecticut And many of you took our flyers.

17
00:01:24,368 --> 00:01:27,520
Speaker 1: in fact unlike previous cons people actually asked us for flyers.

18
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:28,526
Speaker 1: hooray.

19
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:34,033
Speaker 1: Also, I've just noticed in the Libsyn and such that we have a lot of new listeners.

20
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:37,165
Speaker 1: regardless of all that hooray again Welcome.

21
00:01:37,185 --> 00:01:40,324
Speaker 0: yeah, we're come to geek night Zombocom.

22
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,332
Speaker 0: anything is possible now.

23
00:01:42,372 --> 00:01:47,873
Speaker 1: the drawback of that to all of you current listeners Is that you're gonna have to hear us talk about all that new listener crap again.

24
00:01:48,335 --> 00:01:51,245
Speaker 0: all right new listeners listen up This is geek nights.

25
00:01:51,706 --> 00:01:53,111
Speaker 0: It's a podcast.

26
00:01:53,632 --> 00:01:54,596
Speaker 0: if you're listening to it.

27
00:01:54,736 --> 00:01:55,799
Speaker 0: You already know how.

28
00:01:56,607 --> 00:01:57,698
Speaker 0: You don't need any more help.

29
00:01:58,341 --> 00:02:04,539
Speaker 0: We have a forum where we talk about the stuff that we talk about on the show on the internet on the show.

30
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:05,523
Speaker 1: the form Is pretty kickin.

31
00:02:06,046 --> 00:02:09,039
Speaker 1: yep, we actually have a lot of people in there more so than a lot of other podcasts.

32
00:02:09,101 --> 00:02:10,277
Speaker 1: We know that have a lot more listeners.

33
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,955
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if you got to us by some other means such as iTunes you want to go to front row.

34
00:02:16,075 --> 00:02:17,178
Speaker 0: crew comm.

35
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,679
Speaker 1: yep The forums are there show notes are there links to everything we talk about?

36
00:02:21,202 --> 00:02:22,045
Speaker 1: We have a frapper map.

37
00:02:22,085 --> 00:02:23,410
Speaker 1: you can see where all our listeners are.

38
00:02:23,691 --> 00:02:26,944
Speaker 1: you can marvel at the fact that many of our listeners are Not Americans.

39
00:02:27,446 --> 00:02:36,560
Speaker 0: you can email us at geek nights at front row crew Comm if you want to tell us something and then we probably will read it on the show if it's intelligent.

40
00:02:37,164 --> 00:02:40,000
Speaker 1: Yep, we've just started reading things more and more recently.

41
00:02:40,121 --> 00:02:43,580
Speaker 1: We'll probably reading a lot more as we continue to argue with anime world order.

42
00:02:43,812 --> 00:02:53,200
Speaker 0: Yeah If you want to send us some audio you can just record a little mp3 or something and email that to us by Attachment or put it on the web and link to it or something like that.

43
00:02:53,622 --> 00:02:55,858
Speaker 1: Or if you're a lot I'd find us in person and give us a CD.

44
00:02:56,462 --> 00:03:00,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, Luddite did did art boy actually give us that CD over the weekend or no?

45
00:03:00,683 --> 00:03:06,342
Speaker 0: He said he gave it to you, and then I said no We didn't give it to me said you didn't give it to him give it to me And then he didn't.

46
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,033
Speaker 1: he said he would give it to me, and then he didn't and then I left.

47
00:03:09,053 --> 00:03:10,860
Speaker 0: hey great good job.

48
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:12,265
Speaker 1: Oh, well anyway.

49
00:03:12,285 --> 00:03:14,251
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's all we really got to say about that.

50
00:03:14,552 --> 00:03:18,285
Speaker 1: actually we have a lot of interesting leader Bits more so than other days.

51
00:03:18,305 --> 00:03:23,945
Speaker 1: a completely unrelated to the weekend will hold off on reporting on Kineticon until Wednesday Which is anime day.

52
00:03:24,206 --> 00:03:27,036
Speaker 1: yep today is Monday, which is science and technology day.

53
00:03:27,237 --> 00:03:27,859
Speaker 0: That is right.

54
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:36,100
Speaker 1: We're gonna talk about some technology today, but of course before we do that We always cover the news and whatever you know crap happened in our lives and mine's real short.

55
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:52,410
Speaker 1: I was in the Bronx doing some work, and I got off work early like earlier than I suspected Which was kind of annoying because the ninja consultant podcast is tonight celebrating their one-year anniversary And they invited us to their awesome party down in Manhattan Which Scott wanted to go to.

56
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,280
Speaker 1: but you really there's no way you could have made it.

57
00:03:54,441 --> 00:04:05,280
Speaker 1: There's really no way I could have made it and I wanted to but As far as I knew for most of today I was gonna be stuck in Yonkers all day And it's a pain in the ass to get from Yonkers to Manhattan on a weekday night.

58
00:04:05,822 --> 00:04:15,320
Speaker 1: It sure is because most of this stuff's going the opposite direction, so I told him sorry guys We can't make it and then of like four hours later I'm in the Bronx, and I probably could have gone, but it was too late.

59
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,289
Speaker 1: I really it was too late to change my plans.

60
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,353
Speaker 1: Yeah, so instead.

61
00:04:18,374 --> 00:04:19,820
Speaker 0: I'm sure we will hook up with those guys.

62
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:21,748
Speaker 0: They were at anime next and I guess we missed them.

63
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, we met every other podcast in the universe.

64
00:04:25,381 --> 00:04:26,647
Speaker 0: They'll probably go to Otacon.

65
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:27,391
Speaker 0: We'll have to ask them.

66
00:04:27,592 --> 00:04:29,200
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, definitely hook up at Otacon.

67
00:04:29,724 --> 00:04:31,780
Speaker 1: We're having one hell of a podcast and party.

68
00:04:32,182 --> 00:04:35,818
Speaker 1: Oh, we sure as hell are but we'll talk about that as time goes on.

69
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:47,736
Speaker 1: yes We will now because I had all this free time in the Bronx And I've needed a haircut for I don't know about six months because for anyone who hasn't ever actually seen me I have very long hair and it had gotten too long.

70
00:04:47,756 --> 00:04:56,468
Speaker 1: now Aesthetically I don't think there's such thing is too long, but if your hair was just dragging on the floor Ah, I could do cool things with that.

71
00:04:57,151 --> 00:04:57,413
Speaker 0: No.

72
00:04:57,473 --> 00:04:58,357
Speaker 0: That's just a mess.

73
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:00,790
Speaker 1: well You see I bind it or something.

74
00:05:00,891 --> 00:05:02,904
Speaker 0: if it's hanging down below your ass It's a mess.

75
00:05:02,945 --> 00:05:04,456
Speaker 1: I turned it into rope and make a belt out of it.

76
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:06,525
Speaker 0: Anyway, that's just bad.

77
00:05:06,585 --> 00:05:14,780
Speaker 1: the operative part is my hair finally got so long that it wasn't sustainable And the hair was breaking at the front of my head because it was too heavy in the back.

78
00:05:15,323 --> 00:05:19,212
Speaker 1: So I got this cool lady who didn't speak much English But she was very good at cutting hair.

79
00:05:19,515 --> 00:05:19,960
Speaker 1: cut my hair.

80
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,830
Speaker 1: But the funny part is she didn't speak a lot of English.

81
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:33,966
Speaker 1: and when I walk in to this Barbershop salon, and I say like I need a haircut She looks at me with this mortified look on her face, and she runs over and she's like no No, you cannot cut that hair off.

82
00:05:34,006 --> 00:05:34,589
Speaker 1: It's beautiful.

83
00:05:34,609 --> 00:05:35,633
Speaker 1: I won't do it.

84
00:05:35,654 --> 00:05:37,965
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I was like no no I just want to trim.

85
00:05:37,986 --> 00:05:38,690
Speaker 1: I'm not cutting it off.

86
00:05:38,751 --> 00:05:40,823
Speaker 1: She's like oh oh come in I'll wash it like.

87
00:05:40,884 --> 00:05:43,840
Speaker 1: she really wanted to wash my hair and she kept telling me how much she loved my hair.

88
00:05:43,962 --> 00:05:44,517
Speaker 1: It was kind of fun.

89
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:46,668
Speaker 1: She gave me an awesome haircut for very little money.

90
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:52,071
Speaker 0: next time you'll have to go find some like fancy place in the city With the the fancy fancy.

91
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:53,519
Speaker 1: see if they give a better haircut or not.

92
00:05:53,861 --> 00:06:00,876
Speaker 0: Yeah, all those like those frou-frou people You know and like the gay guys who cut hair or like the that feng shui haircut on bullshit.

93
00:06:01,117 --> 00:06:01,919
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't want that.

94
00:06:03,401 --> 00:06:14,154
Speaker 0: But yeah like those super ultra fancy $200 salons that are all tricked out and hipster Yeah, I have a feeling that scruffy's $300 haircut isn't so snazzy.

95
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:15,599
Speaker 0: no, no, it's not.

96
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,680
Speaker 1: no I think Scott's a leader bit is a little more interesting.

97
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:23,579
Speaker 0: Yeah, so like people may or may not know I got a speeding ticket in Jersey last week.

98
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,560
Speaker 0: now I got a speeding ticket in New York.

99
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,695
Speaker 0: They just kind of gave me the ticket and then I dealt with it and that was it.

100
00:06:29,117 --> 00:06:31,294
Speaker 0: in New Jersey It went a little differently.

101
00:06:31,617 --> 00:06:36,591
Speaker 0: you see Today I I don't know how to talk about this.

102
00:06:36,872 --> 00:06:47,550
Speaker 0: basically it was a big ticket So I didn't really want to pay it especially since it was sort of bullshit And the cop was an ass and I wasn't really yeah.

103
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:52,999
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever anyway unlike the New York ticket Which I just baldly admit get to the important part.

104
00:06:53,401 --> 00:07:08,179
Speaker 0: so I considered getting a lawyer to go to the court for me to do whatever and I found out today while researching lawyers and emailing them and such that in New Jersey You can just go to this website and pay your ticket just ding.

105
00:07:09,144 --> 00:07:20,179
Speaker 0: but also in New Jersey it goes on like the record of the court when you get a ticket and It's kind of weird that today was the first day I had ever contacted a lawyer ever.

106
00:07:20,802 --> 00:07:24,191
Speaker 0: Yet today was also the day where I received how many letters in the mail.

107
00:07:24,251 --> 00:07:30,608
Speaker 0: what like five six more than that is between five and ten letters from lawyers.

108
00:07:30,929 --> 00:07:41,857
Speaker 0: there was an army of traffic lawyers in New Jersey Watching the court record for traffic tickets and Sending basically junk mail to anyone who gets a ticket.

109
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:51,100
Speaker 1: now This is evidence to me that there is some sort of racket going on some sort of economic incentive all the way round.

110
00:07:51,983 --> 00:07:59,454
Speaker 0: It's an obvious racket and the fact that it's so obvious means There's not a goddamn thing you can do about it attitude going on.

111
00:07:59,474 --> 00:08:00,780
Speaker 1: I just find it hilarious.

112
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:11,146
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know the thing is is that the lawyers I actually talked to we're basically saying yep speeding is bullshit Yep, it doesn't make the road safer.

113
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:11,908
Speaker 0: Yep.

114
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:19,856
Speaker 0: It's just a way for the states to basically bandit you on the highway and Here's the only goddamn things we can do about it.

115
00:08:20,861 --> 00:08:39,090
Speaker 1: basically the best they'll usually do is go and talk to the judge and get a speeding ticket turned into a parking ticket which Means I mean with a speeding ticket the state takes a cut and the feds take a cut depending and all these people get a cut of the money and you get a small percentage if A town writes a parking ticket or certain other kinds of tickets.

116
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,078
Speaker 1: It's a municipal thing and they get all the money.

117
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:50,580
Speaker 1: So a lot of places will turn your you know two-point speeding ticket into a zero-point non moving violation not reported to anyone parking ticket.

118
00:08:51,001 --> 00:08:57,462
Speaker 1: But the parking ticket is one more money than the speeding ticket and to all of the money goes to the town where the judge presides.

119
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:16,669
Speaker 0: yeah, basically my choices are pay a $200 speeding ticket and then gamble on how much my insurance will go up for the next three years or to hire a lawyer for a pile of money who will go to the court for a pile of money get the ticket doubled to $400 and then my insurance won't know.

120
00:09:16,749 --> 00:09:23,295
Speaker 0: so it's either a big cost right now or a Potentially bigger cost in the long run.

121
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:23,557
Speaker 0: now.

122
00:09:23,577 --> 00:09:28,411
Speaker 1: now now Here's the point where rim that is me gives to Scott.

123
00:09:28,471 --> 00:09:33,507
Speaker 1: that is him the kind of advice that Scott that is him would usually Give to someone like me.

124
00:09:33,929 --> 00:09:34,472
Speaker 1: That is me.

125
00:09:35,014 --> 00:09:36,020
Speaker 1: Why aren't you just me?

126
00:09:36,641 --> 00:09:40,375
Speaker 1: I have a lawyer on retainer from my company who will fight this for free.

127
00:09:40,656 --> 00:09:41,800
Speaker 1: Why don't you have a lawyer for free?

128
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,628
Speaker 1: It's your fault for not having a free lawyer.

129
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:45,940
Speaker 0: My company didn't give me a free lawyer.

130
00:09:46,602 --> 00:09:47,205
Speaker 0: You didn't even know.

131
00:09:47,225 --> 00:09:50,978
Speaker 1: this is such a thing is pretty well, I guess you are suck for not having that mr.

132
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:54,583
Speaker 0: Anyway, mr.

133
00:09:54,624 --> 00:10:10,124
Speaker 0: The kids need the opiate you just crawl their way to the border Is that Basically, I've decided I'm probably just gonna pay it because I won't get any points on my license because I'm a New York driver Which is good.

134
00:10:10,345 --> 00:10:17,374
Speaker 1: Yeah, New York State despite the fact that they use the speeding racket to make money They won't accept tickets from freaking any other state.

135
00:10:17,394 --> 00:10:18,880
Speaker 0: Well, they said they accept the ticket.

136
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,240
Speaker 0: They just don't add points to your license.

137
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:24,252
Speaker 1: Well, no, so they don't really accept it as if it doesn't do anything.

138
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,200
Speaker 0: I'll be your New York insurance still finds out.

139
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,647
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, but they can find out independently.

140
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:30,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz they they look in databases and they get notified.

141
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:32,110
Speaker 1: But well, that's also a racket.

142
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,898
Speaker 1: but we could talk about car insurance another day.

143
00:10:34,421 --> 00:10:41,120
Speaker 1: But New York won't give you grief about a ticket you got anywhere else except Ontario and Quebec.

144
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:50,857
Speaker 1: Yeah, which was great when I was in high in college because I drive through Ontario all the time speeding But I was a Michigan resident and Michigan doesn't accept tickets from fuck anyone.

145
00:10:50,877 --> 00:10:56,399
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm And now I'm a New Yorker, but I don't go to Canada so often anymore Me either because they're very far away from it now?

146
00:10:56,761 --> 00:10:57,745
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it used to be.

147
00:10:57,766 --> 00:11:04,099
Speaker 0: we're right next to her almost as far away from it as you can be in, New York Which is probably the Hamptons as far away as you can.

148
00:11:05,764 --> 00:11:06,840
Speaker 1: It may be some Staten Island.

149
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:09,409
Speaker 0: No, the Hamptons at the end of Long Island.

150
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:09,991
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

151
00:11:10,152 --> 00:11:11,819
Speaker 1: Yeah, so yeah, Long Island is big.

152
00:11:12,202 --> 00:11:23,540
Speaker 0: The thing is even if it costs me more money in the long run it'll feel less painful and Give money to my insurance company, which while evil is less evil than the racket in New Jersey.

153
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,680
Speaker 1: Are you still gonna go fight the ticket?

154
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:26,634
Speaker 0: I don't know because I will warn you.

155
00:11:26,654 --> 00:11:31,338
Speaker 1: if you do fight it They'll probably if they do find you guilty, which I'm not gonna give my opinion.

156
00:11:31,378 --> 00:11:36,520
Speaker 1: either way You're welcome to fight in our wonderful judicial system, but they usually tack on a court fee.

157
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,403
Speaker 1: That's a lot of money like 80 or 90 bucks.

158
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,029
Speaker 1: Yes an administrative fee and then a state surcharge.

159
00:11:42,349 --> 00:11:46,978
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Magically those things don't happen if you just plead guilty and don't put up a fight.

160
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:49,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, funny how that works.

161
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:55,773
Speaker 0: So now I what I really want to know is there a way I can sue New Jersey Lawyers for sending me junk mail.

162
00:11:55,813 --> 00:11:59,319
Speaker 1: You know what the answer is Everyone thinks that and that never happens.

163
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,299
Speaker 1: You Should ask all the lawyers and give them as much verbal trouble as you can.

164
00:12:04,962 --> 00:12:08,977
Speaker 0: Is there there has to be a way maybe to like charge all these people the racketeering or something?

165
00:12:09,238 --> 00:12:09,740
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

166
00:12:10,141 --> 00:12:10,984
Speaker 1: Why don't we?

167
00:12:11,385 --> 00:12:16,940
Speaker 1: because New York is a state a one-party consent state meaning if you call someone on the phone You're on a phone conversation.

168
00:12:17,462 --> 00:12:23,340
Speaker 1: If any one person in the conversation consents to the conversation being recorded that conversation can legally be recorded.

169
00:12:23,601 --> 00:12:26,755
Speaker 1: I'm not a hundred percent sure about New Jersey, but I'm pretty sure it's the same way.

170
00:12:27,277 --> 00:12:29,360
Speaker 1: if that's true We'll set up our Skype.

171
00:12:29,842 --> 00:12:34,699
Speaker 1: You can call every one of those lawyers will record them all and I guarantee you will get some funny bits.

172
00:12:35,302 --> 00:12:44,680
Speaker 0: The thing was is that when I called most of the lawyers they had, you know They said sensible things the two lawyers that I've actually so I say get him on like, how'd you get my address?

173
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,757
Speaker 1: So you sit and troll the database watching for people getting tickets and just ambulance chase them.

174
00:12:50,058 --> 00:12:50,519
Speaker 1: What's the deal?

175
00:12:51,561 --> 00:12:52,324
Speaker 1: And just see what we can get.

176
00:12:52,344 --> 00:12:53,949
Speaker 0: All right, maybe they'll get some.

177
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,899
Speaker 1: maybe one of them will explode all Edgeworth style on us.

178
00:12:57,361 --> 00:13:02,436
Speaker 0: Awesome, some of the lawyers actually if you look at the pieces of paper, they sent me were pretty humorous lawyers.

179
00:13:02,777 --> 00:13:08,983
Speaker 0: Yeah of various humorous and stereotypical backgrounds All right.

180
00:13:09,104 --> 00:13:16,459
Speaker 1: Anyway, we should probably move on to the news Now it's like it's science and tech day and I got some science and tech here now.

181
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,648
Speaker 1: DNS has been around for a long time.

182
00:13:18,688 --> 00:13:21,960
Speaker 1: It's the system that you type a domain name.

183
00:13:22,181 --> 00:13:31,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, you type a name into a web browser or something and it gets translated by this system into an IP address Which is the address that you want to connect to.

184
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:37,835
Speaker 1: I'm doing this in very layman's terms because anyone who doesn't need layman's terms Knows what DNS is especially our Monday listeners Mm-hmm.

185
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:52,629
Speaker 1: now there have been a lot of people who say the DNS is broken or old or stupid and a lot of people who propose alternatives and a number of people have tried to actually create alternatives and Our current one that is making the rounds is open DNS.

186
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:53,210
Speaker 1: now.

187
00:13:53,270 --> 00:14:06,881
Speaker 1: their shtick is that they protect you from phishers the people who have like eBay Dot-com or goggle dot-com and then they try to trick you into giving them account information or installing spyware all sorts of bad stuff Mm-hmm.

188
00:14:07,122 --> 00:14:15,125
Speaker 1: and their shtick is that they reroute common misspellings of major domains to the actual domains protecting you Which I don't know.

189
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:20,039
Speaker 1: I feel about that because what if your domain is just similar to another domain But it's not one of those sites?

190
00:14:20,592 --> 00:14:28,611
Speaker 0: Yeah I really don't like it when you're really depending on these guys to Know which domains are real and which ones are not and to maintain that.

191
00:14:28,852 --> 00:14:44,786
Speaker 1: yeah now just when it comes to internet technology I am very much leery of any point at which Humans start making decisions as opposed to computers with algorithms because algorithms are 100% reliable Unless the algorithm is broken and then it's broken in a reliable way.

192
00:14:44,846 --> 00:14:45,508
Speaker 1: my problem.

193
00:14:45,548 --> 00:14:48,870
Speaker 0: Here is really that they're Solving a problem.

194
00:14:49,633 --> 00:14:50,878
Speaker 0: They're finding a use for it.

195
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:52,504
Speaker 0: It's good for hacking.

196
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:58,890
Speaker 0: you know from a hacking standpoint It's interesting to use a tool to solve a problem that it wasn't designed to solve.

197
00:14:59,572 --> 00:15:04,850
Speaker 0: But they're solving this particular problem in the wrong spot thus causing other problems.

198
00:15:05,334 --> 00:15:12,044
Speaker 0: There's a much better way to solve the phishing problem And that's a spell checker in the location bar of the web browser now.

199
00:15:12,124 --> 00:15:13,809
Speaker 1: They're they're bigger parts to this than that.

200
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:20,117
Speaker 1: DNS is old venerable, and it works very very well And I want to.

201
00:15:20,137 --> 00:15:27,124
Speaker 1: I'm gonna make a broad generalization about IT students and young Technology professionals in college because I was once there and I know.

202
00:15:27,144 --> 00:15:40,308
Speaker 1: it seems to me that Everyone who's a freshman or a sophomore at an IT school or even a lot of CS schools and MIS schools Will always once they start learning about DNS and they start making DNS servers talk about how.

203
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:52,429
Speaker 1: you know They're so smart and DNS is stupid and broken and it's honest last legs and it's gonna be replaced any day now but something better and everything's corrupt and all this crap and they always come up with some crapo solution to replace it.

204
00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:54,717
Speaker 1: and You're dumb.

205
00:15:54,979 --> 00:15:59,282
Speaker 1: I'm telling you right now Once you get two more years of schooling you're gonna realize that that's not true.

206
00:15:59,302 --> 00:16:01,350
Speaker 1: DNS is mostly just fine.

207
00:16:01,693 --> 00:16:03,149
Speaker 1: Your idea was a bad idea.

208
00:16:03,972 --> 00:16:09,310
Speaker 0: Now people who don't realize I will agree that there is probably something better than DNS.

209
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:13,010
Speaker 1: Oh, definitely, but well one DNS works very well.

210
00:16:13,191 --> 00:16:13,961
Speaker 0: How are you gonna do it to?

211
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:19,000
Speaker 1: DNS is not designed to be transitioned to or from.

212
00:16:19,181 --> 00:16:24,276
Speaker 1: really if you have a DNS system and you Want to use an alternate DNS system?

213
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:28,570
Speaker 1: You can't use both on your computer easily because of the way DNS works.

214
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:34,150
Speaker 1: You'd have to do a lot of hacking to make it work reliably when you're talking to two separate name hierarchies.

215
00:16:34,512 --> 00:16:40,806
Speaker 1: So if you want to use one of these alternate DNS systems like open DNS You have to just go switch to it entirely.

216
00:16:40,826 --> 00:16:47,210
Speaker 1: now Open DNS at least relies a little bit on the root real DNS servers to get a lot of its information.

217
00:16:47,672 --> 00:16:49,902
Speaker 1: So they kind of piggyback off of that, but they add their own stuff.

218
00:16:50,204 --> 00:16:52,729
Speaker 1: like they can add their own domains They can do whatever they want.

219
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:59,205
Speaker 1: They do one really kind of shitty thing where if you type in a domain that isn't real They will redirect you to their own website.

220
00:16:59,225 --> 00:16:59,870
Speaker 1: That's full of ads.

221
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,939
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you type but it's not full of ads.

222
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,470
Speaker 1: it has ads on it and they make money off of them.

223
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,292
Speaker 0: That's how they make.

224
00:17:05,313 --> 00:17:13,089
Speaker 0: their money is if you go to a site that really really doesn't exist at all And it's not just a misspelling You're just way off entirely.

225
00:17:13,811 --> 00:17:19,813
Speaker 0: It will send you to a web page with an ad on it and that is clearly labeled as an ad and they get money From that.

226
00:17:20,155 --> 00:17:24,259
Speaker 0: personally if I go to a site that's not a site I want it to say this is not a site and that's it.

227
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:27,030
Speaker 1: now my main my problems with this because people might say why?

228
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:28,175
Speaker 1: Rain on these people's parade.

229
00:17:28,194 --> 00:17:30,950
Speaker 1: they're doing this and they think it's a good thing and it's optional.

230
00:17:31,312 --> 00:17:34,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, but these guys at least they're not screwing up the existing system.

231
00:17:35,245 --> 00:17:37,977
Speaker 1: No but there have been things like this before and there'll be things like this in the future.

232
00:17:38,017 --> 00:17:45,950
Speaker 1: the people that do this are Spending so much time and resource and the I just get this vibe that they're really kind of scary people.

233
00:17:46,334 --> 00:17:49,437
Speaker 1: Maybe if one of them listens to geek nights They'll call in and give us some feedback on this.

234
00:17:49,477 --> 00:17:52,730
Speaker 1: but I note that slashdot had the story about open DNS.

235
00:17:53,810 --> 00:18:00,690
Speaker 1: Immediately one of the guys from open DNS is all over slashdot shilling it and arguing with people even better.

236
00:18:01,171 --> 00:18:09,034
Speaker 1: His arguments really gave me that vibe of like a fanboy who's defending his fanboyness more than a technologist Who's defending his technology?

237
00:18:09,495 --> 00:18:12,082
Speaker 0: It's like they're really hard to defend this as technology.

238
00:18:12,282 --> 00:18:13,766
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean DNS is fine.

239
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,070
Speaker 1: It has problems.

240
00:18:15,431 --> 00:18:16,796
Speaker 1: I could do a whole thing about DNS.

241
00:18:16,816 --> 00:18:18,101
Speaker 1: I probably said numerous times.

242
00:18:18,141 --> 00:18:19,366
Speaker 1: I'll do a whole thing about DNS.

243
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:20,390
Speaker 0: someone write that down.

244
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:27,690
Speaker 0: We need a thread in the forums Anytime we say we're gonna do a show on X and we'd ever do a show on X. that's because we forgot.

245
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:34,565
Speaker 0: So someone make a thread in the forums and everyone go and post all the X's that we've never done a show about that.

246
00:18:34,585 --> 00:18:38,750
Speaker 0: we said we would because You know we come up and it's time to do a show and we go, huh?

247
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:39,778
Speaker 0: What do we do a show about?

248
00:18:39,979 --> 00:18:41,310
Speaker 0: if I had a list of all those things?

249
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:44,063
Speaker 0: It would be so much easier unless it's Wednesday cuz anime days.

250
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,295
Speaker 1: We just knock off without even thinking Yeah, that's easy.

251
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:48,167
Speaker 0: But you know the Mondays most end of Thursdays.

252
00:18:48,449 --> 00:19:00,524
Speaker 1: Yep But yeah, my real suggestion here is that I highly recommend this is my professional opinion as an information technologist Don't use alternative DNS structures.

253
00:19:00,925 --> 00:19:19,350
Speaker 0: They are often slow unreliable broken shady or just dangerous and the problems that open DNS solves are better solved via other Means such as a spell checker for the location bar in the web browsing or just you know Societal cultural change or better law enforcement or whatnot.

254
00:19:19,562 --> 00:19:31,986
Speaker 0: Yeah People learning to understand that it was in real sites and fake sites and all sorts of other technologies are much better technology wise for stopping What's it called fishing fishing scamming?

255
00:19:32,006 --> 00:19:39,858
Speaker 1: Yep Ma'am no, well, they want to stop spam with it - yeah That's not good.

256
00:19:40,851 --> 00:19:51,637
Speaker 1: See the best thing about this is that someone posted something I haven't seen in a while That there is a form that someone made a long freaking time ago and it is a list of reasons Why an anti-spam solution will fail.

257
00:19:51,998 --> 00:19:59,726
Speaker 1: and whenever someone proposes an anti-spam solution someone smart will take this form Check the appropriate boxes and post it on wherever the solution was posted.

258
00:19:59,947 --> 00:20:02,942
Speaker 1: I remember that Yeah, and someone posted it for this and you know what?

259
00:20:03,464 --> 00:20:12,938
Speaker 1: That is one of the few technology memes like that out there that once again in my professional technical opinion is Almost 100% accurate.

260
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:17,576
Speaker 1: if you come up with a spam solution that defeats that thing You are an instant millionaire.

261
00:20:17,596 --> 00:20:18,498
Speaker 0: it pretty much.

262
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:25,962
Speaker 0: if you're thinking about a way to stop spam or fishing or anything like that Just go to this website and every time you think of something look at the list.

263
00:20:26,363 --> 00:20:36,278
Speaker 0: and if you and keep trying to beat the List because when you beat the list your Bill Gates number two if you beat the list, you'll have slashdot behind you He will be so mad monies.

264
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,005
Speaker 0: We should go look at it right now.

265
00:20:38,165 --> 00:20:40,553
Speaker 1: I Know it practically by heart.

266
00:20:40,714 --> 00:20:46,833
Speaker 0: All right, so in other tech news Firefox, which is the browser everyone should be using Yeah, what?

267
00:20:46,873 --> 00:20:49,805
Speaker 1: there's a story that may or may not be true that it was that it hit 25% of a market share.

268
00:20:51,672 --> 00:21:12,706
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, Firefox 2.0 beta 1 release candidate 1 Is coming out Which which I wouldn't recommend using is your full-time browser Because it's beta 1 but you can put it on a thumb drive and run that without Messing up your existing Firefox install.

269
00:21:13,089 --> 00:21:21,420
Speaker 1: Yep and also if you really like Firefox you can use it and test it and when it breaks or something doesn't work the way you want it to tell the Firefox people yeah in the bugzilla whatnot.

270
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,599
Speaker 0: You don't even really have to install on a thumb drive You just get a thumb drive version.

271
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:26,430
Speaker 0: install it in some folder like on your desktop.

272
00:21:27,211 --> 00:21:31,630
Speaker 0: Anyway, the new features which is what everyone really wants to know is why should I go to the new Firefox?

273
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,234
Speaker 0: What's gonna be different?

274
00:21:33,435 --> 00:21:38,958
Speaker 0: and the thing is when Firefox point seven was out I was like, what could they possibly do to make this better?

275
00:21:38,978 --> 00:21:44,137
Speaker 1: Hell Firefox like almost every version of Firefox I thought this is almost perfect.

276
00:21:44,438 --> 00:21:47,328
Speaker 0: and then point eight came out and I was like goddamn if that isn't better.

277
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:48,794
Speaker 0: and 1.0 came out.

278
00:21:48,814 --> 00:21:50,341
Speaker 0: I was like goddamn that isn't better.

279
00:21:50,361 --> 00:21:52,450
Speaker 0: and then one they're like we're coming out with 1.1.

280
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,017
Speaker 0: I'm like, what are you gonna do?

281
00:21:54,037 --> 00:21:55,222
Speaker 0: There's nothing left to do.

282
00:21:55,242 --> 00:21:57,151
Speaker 0: Well, goddamn they proved me wrong again All right.

283
00:21:57,171 --> 00:21:59,279
Speaker 1: So what the hell did they add is what they're adding.

284
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,418
Speaker 0: They're gonna put closed buttons on all the tabs Which is something they've been arguing about.

285
00:22:04,438 --> 00:22:05,923
Speaker 1: and can I turn that off?

286
00:22:06,365 --> 00:22:07,650
Speaker 0: I don't know because I don't think I like that.

287
00:22:08,152 --> 00:22:09,658
Speaker 1: I don't know but that's an aesthetic thing.

288
00:22:09,818 --> 00:22:12,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, the you know the search box in the top, right?

289
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,963
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're making it a lot easier to manage.

290
00:22:15,003 --> 00:22:15,607
Speaker 0: What's in there?

291
00:22:15,687 --> 00:22:17,949
Speaker 1: good Because I like it.

292
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:27,513
Speaker 1: But if you're if you're not someone like us who knows a lot about this sort of thing and you wanted to put something in There that someone else didn't already make and make an easy way to do Yeah, you know how.

293
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:35,524
Speaker 0: also, you know, sometimes your browser crashes and then you open it again You lose all your tabs and some people made extensions that will save your tabs.

294
00:22:35,745 --> 00:22:36,970
Speaker 0: Well now they're just gonna do that.

295
00:22:37,311 --> 00:22:37,693
Speaker 1: That's good.

296
00:22:37,813 --> 00:22:40,042
Speaker 1: Even though your bra well, I'll say your browser shouldn't crash.

297
00:22:40,403 --> 00:22:41,929
Speaker 1: Firefox crashes a lot for me now.

298
00:22:41,949 --> 00:22:43,154
Speaker 0: now Here's something they're doing.

299
00:22:43,174 --> 00:22:46,329
Speaker 0: this is my biggest one that I love because they remove the other one that I like.

300
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:50,450
Speaker 0: You know how there used to be extensions that do this, but they don't work anymore.

301
00:22:51,013 --> 00:22:53,546
Speaker 0: That would add a spell checker to the browser.

302
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:55,917
Speaker 0: Yeah Typing in a comment box.

303
00:22:55,937 --> 00:22:57,122
Speaker 0: You can spell check that shit.

304
00:22:57,684 --> 00:23:02,783
Speaker 1: Yeah as an aside I'm glad that all of our forum users are using the spell check we put in.

305
00:23:03,124 --> 00:23:03,325
Speaker 0: Yep.

306
00:23:03,566 --> 00:23:05,131
Speaker 1: It's all I got to say about that Mr.

307
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:05,352
Speaker 1: Paul.

308
00:23:05,372 --> 00:23:07,118
Speaker 0: Yeah, we upgraded anyone out there.

309
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:09,708
Speaker 0: We upgraded the forums and now they're much more awesome.

310
00:23:10,069 --> 00:23:11,394
Speaker 1: Yes We've liked the.

311
00:23:11,574 --> 00:23:14,765
Speaker 1: the issues that remain are almost insignificant.

312
00:23:14,785 --> 00:23:21,090
Speaker 0: There's no way you'll even see him Yep, and if you do have an issue just let me know and I'll upgrade the appropriate bits.

313
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:24,190
Speaker 0: Alright, so there's also an anti-phishing tool.

314
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:33,390
Speaker 0: Guess you don't need open DNS Haha, and basically what that is is if you go to a site that has been blacklisted by Mozilla It'll warn you but you can still go to the site.

315
00:23:33,691 --> 00:23:34,192
Speaker 1: I like that.

316
00:23:34,573 --> 00:23:37,602
Speaker 1: of course a black list suck is one of the options.

317
00:23:37,843 --> 00:23:43,487
Speaker 0: on the spam solutions that fail for Well, I don't think they mean it to be an absolute spam solution.

318
00:23:43,527 --> 00:23:44,130
Speaker 0: It's just a little help.

319
00:23:44,252 --> 00:23:47,579
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I like helpers but as long as no one thinks that this will protect them from anything.

320
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:56,889
Speaker 0: no Firefox just using Firefox protects you a lot and The thing that I wanted that they're removing is the new bookmarks thing because you know bookmarks and Firefox.

321
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,489
Speaker 0: now We're kind of crappy to manage.

322
00:23:59,101 --> 00:23:59,510
Speaker 1: You know what?

323
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:06,594
Speaker 1: Honestly, I had noticed because the more I won the more I use delicious into the more as you use the bookmark the more this Web 2.0 thing.

324
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:10,889
Speaker 1: my bookmarks exist solely to have all my banking sites which are in my delicious.

325
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:12,835
Speaker 1: now Yeah, and my web comics?

326
00:24:13,457 --> 00:24:16,125
Speaker 0: my bookmarks are solely my RSS feeds.

327
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,730
Speaker 0: a lot for the you know, whatnots?

328
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:23,728
Speaker 0: yep, so I don't use RSS yeah and websites that I visit once a day like all the web comics.

329
00:24:23,788 --> 00:24:31,810
Speaker 0: and And also quick things like if you make a bookmark of a website you can like make a short name for it.

330
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:43,290
Speaker 0: So if I type in dig and press enter it actually goes to dig comm slash view all and if I type in Like Gmail it actually goes to mail that google.com slash blah blah blah blah to my email.

331
00:24:43,753 --> 00:24:44,963
Speaker 0: That's what I use bookmarks for.

332
00:24:45,346 --> 00:24:53,150
Speaker 0: but anyway There it was going to a. there was going to be a new bookmark manager called places and it was really cool.

333
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:55,982
Speaker 0: But the they got rid of it they canned it.

334
00:24:56,263 --> 00:25:04,029
Speaker 0: so sadness great Yep, but there are many other awesome things mostly the spell checker to look forward to now.

335
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:07,309
Speaker 1: actually I very happily as I poke around in the stats of geek nights.

336
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:07,972
Speaker 1: They were in.

337
00:25:08,012 --> 00:25:12,330
Speaker 1: fewer people use Internet Explorer in any way to view geek nights at least our website.

338
00:25:12,491 --> 00:25:13,555
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, you know what it is.

339
00:25:13,616 --> 00:25:26,610
Speaker 0: It's that Internet Explorer might still be bigger than Firefox but the thing is Firefox users use the web a lot more because they have Firefox and it's easier and because People who use the web a lot more more likely to use Firefox.

340
00:25:27,071 --> 00:25:29,860
Speaker 1: Yep, and I gotta say in the last six months.

341
00:25:30,241 --> 00:25:33,210
Speaker 1: I have not run into a single website that did not work in Firefox.

342
00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:46,370
Speaker 0: Yep so well I would argue that while it's probably true that more people and More computers are on the web using Internet Explorer I would say that more pages web pages are loaded with Firefox.

343
00:25:47,453 --> 00:25:51,427
Speaker 1: I don't know because even the most generous estimates put Firefox about 25% market share.

344
00:25:52,691 --> 00:25:57,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, which means that Firefox users only have to use the web four times as much as normal schmucks.

345
00:25:58,194 --> 00:26:00,370
Speaker 0: That's not much that true, you know.

346
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:03,042
Speaker 1: I'm just saying a lot of people use IE.

347
00:26:03,102 --> 00:26:04,870
Speaker 0: it is a lot a lot of grandmas.

348
00:26:05,131 --> 00:26:09,350
Speaker 0: But I mean even think if it's only 10% I use the web 10 times as much as normal schmucks.

349
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:10,155
Speaker 1: But then again think of this.

350
00:26:10,477 --> 00:26:13,294
Speaker 1: I work in a technology firm I've worked in.

351
00:26:13,415 --> 00:26:22,650
Speaker 1: every company I've worked for has been a technology firm other than our IT Where it was all punk awesome tech kids like me IBM, but my new at my current company and everything.

352
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:26,810
Speaker 1: Every single person except for like one or two used fire or used IE.

353
00:26:27,051 --> 00:26:28,377
Speaker 0: But how much did they browse?

354
00:26:28,618 --> 00:26:30,828
Speaker 0: they browsed a lot did they?

355
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:37,650
Speaker 1: yeah I mean in IBM there was one guy I knew he sat a floor down for me in the office high-rise.

356
00:26:38,012 --> 00:26:42,009
Speaker 1: I don't think he ever did work and not like me where I just didn't have a lot of work to do.

357
00:26:42,594 --> 00:26:44,009
Speaker 1: He just like didn't do work.

358
00:26:44,251 --> 00:26:45,741
Speaker 1: He just sat around surfing the net he had.

359
00:26:45,781 --> 00:26:47,029
Speaker 1: cuz I run in all the time.

360
00:26:49,771 --> 00:26:53,590
Speaker 1: He's a big anime fan - it wall scrolls kind of scary kind of a fanboy.

361
00:26:53,973 --> 00:27:03,490
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't know how he had a job there But maybe the fact that he has a job there is the reason I chose not to work there anymore On a very broad scale.

362
00:27:03,771 --> 00:27:14,830
Speaker 1: But I think there are a lot of people who are in the technology industry who know their shit about like routers or internet Technology and yet they use IE Yeah, which I could say I guess that means they don't know their shit.

363
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:20,449
Speaker 1: But then well that that corollary lays me down the path to almost no one knows their shit.

364
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,689
Speaker 0: That's that's pretty true.

365
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:28,510
Speaker 1: I hate to make the argument of everyone's crazy, but me because the logical conclusion of that argument is that I am crazy.

366
00:27:29,012 --> 00:27:32,270
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm you agree to that Scott you just agreed to that.

367
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,656
Speaker 1: Are you going to stay agreeing to that?

368
00:27:33,716 --> 00:27:35,785
Speaker 1: because I have some arguments with you after the show.

369
00:27:35,805 --> 00:27:40,970
Speaker 1: if that's true Is the argument that everyone is crazy, but me silly or not?

370
00:27:42,172 --> 00:27:43,036
Speaker 0: It's a little bit silly.

371
00:27:43,056 --> 00:27:43,357
Speaker 0: Okay.

372
00:27:43,458 --> 00:27:43,679
Speaker 1: Okay.

373
00:27:43,739 --> 00:27:44,101
Speaker 1: I got you.

374
00:27:44,222 --> 00:27:45,367
Speaker 0: It's not always true.

375
00:27:45,387 --> 00:27:50,422
Speaker 0: Yeah Possible that everyone is crazy, but you yeah, yeah Occam's razor.

376
00:27:50,823 --> 00:27:55,109
Speaker 0: Yeah, most 99.99 percent of the time you're crazy.

377
00:27:55,712 --> 00:27:56,554
Speaker 1: That's all I needed.

378
00:27:56,614 --> 00:27:58,620
Speaker 0: point Oh one percent of the time.

379
00:27:59,102 --> 00:27:59,383
Speaker 0: Yes.

380
00:27:59,543 --> 00:28:01,770
Speaker 0: Everyone is crazy, but you watch like a van gallon.

381
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:05,484
Speaker 1: You have a point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero.

382
00:28:05,544 --> 00:28:06,588
Speaker 1: one percent chance of surviving.

383
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:07,554
Speaker 0: well No, you know what?

384
00:28:07,615 --> 00:28:08,744
Speaker 0: What's the population of the world?

385
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:09,490
Speaker 1: a lot?

386
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:16,894
Speaker 0: Okay, so one over a lot is the chances of everyone is crazy, but you possibly I mean, yeah You got to take into account.

387
00:28:16,934 --> 00:28:18,882
Speaker 1: I don't know free will and all maybe quantum theory.

388
00:28:18,902 --> 00:28:20,227
Speaker 0: Well, whatever.

389
00:28:20,308 --> 00:28:23,696
Speaker 0: Yeah One e over a lot.

390
00:28:24,117 --> 00:28:24,980
Speaker 1: e to the pi.

391
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,369
Speaker 0: i yeah is the chances that everyone is crazy with you.

392
00:28:35,177 --> 00:28:39,150
Speaker 0: things of the day burning new listeners out there the things of the days.

393
00:28:39,752 --> 00:28:46,780
Speaker 0: We each pick some sort of thing on the internet usually some sort of thing of the day Yes, and we talk about it.

394
00:28:46,982 --> 00:28:52,443
Speaker 0: and at front row crew calm There are links to the things of the day for you to listen to or watch.

395
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:53,708
Speaker 1: It's just whatever weird thing.

396
00:28:53,728 --> 00:28:55,696
Speaker 1: worry fine They've been very popular.

397
00:28:55,716 --> 00:28:56,298
Speaker 1: Yep.

398
00:28:56,981 --> 00:29:02,629
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day today is A prank call if you will but an interesting one.

399
00:29:03,151 --> 00:29:10,057
Speaker 0: This British guy calls up a Chinese restaurant and he tells the Chinese restaurant an order and then he says hold on My friend is coming.

400
00:29:10,098 --> 00:29:12,273
Speaker 0: I might want to change the order Whatever.

401
00:29:12,795 --> 00:29:15,486
Speaker 1: yeah, he's like get read it back to me, but just give me a minute.

402
00:29:15,526 --> 00:29:22,090
Speaker 0: I gotta get my friend on the line Yep, so he then calls another Chinese restaurant and he puts them on hold.

403
00:29:22,531 --> 00:29:27,810
Speaker 0: Then he connects the two Chinese restaurants and gets the one to repeat the order to the other.

404
00:29:28,354 --> 00:29:36,090
Speaker 1: Now if you don't see where this is going Both Chinese restaurants now think that they're taking an order from the other Chinese restaurant.

405
00:29:36,372 --> 00:29:39,110
Speaker 0: But actually yeah, you get the idea.

406
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,496
Speaker 1: It's quite hilarious.

407
00:29:41,736 --> 00:29:42,860
Speaker 0: you gotta listen to it.

408
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:44,245
Speaker 0: You're like delivery.

409
00:29:44,265 --> 00:29:45,128
Speaker 0: We don't do delivery.

410
00:29:45,228 --> 00:29:46,331
Speaker 0: We do delivery We don't do.

411
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:47,535
Speaker 1: it's like you come pick it up.

412
00:29:48,357 --> 00:29:51,125
Speaker 1: No, you come pick it up, but but we don't deliver.

413
00:29:51,145 --> 00:30:03,439
Speaker 1: Yeah, and If you've if you've never seen a train wreck, this is probably the most perfect Conversational example of a train wreck ever created.

414
00:30:04,401 --> 00:30:07,870
Speaker 1: it is just two people talking but not understanding.

415
00:30:08,911 --> 00:30:14,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing about it that really makes it work is that you call Chinese restaurants and you don't really communicate in complete sentences.

416
00:30:14,671 --> 00:30:15,920
Speaker 0: You just kind of say words.

417
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,270
Speaker 0: they give the whole idea.

418
00:30:17,491 --> 00:30:20,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, like when I order I says, you know, I don't do delivery.

419
00:30:20,751 --> 00:30:22,901
Speaker 0: The only word that really means anything there is delivery.

420
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:24,489
Speaker 0: So the guy's like we don't we do.

421
00:30:25,471 --> 00:30:28,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's like egg for young is like yes, we have egg for y'all like egg for y'all.

422
00:30:32,052 --> 00:30:33,176
Speaker 1: It takes them a while to.

423
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:36,710
Speaker 1: finally they're both just like, you know what forget you and then they hang up on each other.

424
00:30:36,971 --> 00:30:38,817
Speaker 0: Yep, quite fantastic.

425
00:30:38,977 --> 00:30:40,462
Speaker 1: It is well worth listening to.

426
00:30:40,642 --> 00:30:45,158
Speaker 1: I'd take I'd play it all in the show But you know copyright and all that.

427
00:30:45,901 --> 00:30:47,828
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know if there's any copyright, but whatever.

428
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:49,955
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, all right.

429
00:30:49,975 --> 00:30:54,230
Speaker 1: My thing is much less amazingly funny, but it's more somewhat useful.

430
00:30:54,711 --> 00:31:02,902
Speaker 1: Someone made a chart that's for the most part accurate of all the major religions in the world including some things I would call cults and not religions.

431
00:31:03,225 --> 00:31:03,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever.

432
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:06,037
Speaker 1: Well, it depends on how much of a distinction you make.

433
00:31:06,098 --> 00:31:09,830
Speaker 0: but there everything I have a list of 20 characteristics of a cult.

434
00:31:09,931 --> 00:31:10,948
Speaker 0: If you have 10, you're a cult.

435
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,300
Speaker 1: Remember that argument we had with the Scientologists.

436
00:31:14,722 --> 00:31:15,766
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was great.

437
00:31:15,787 --> 00:31:16,510
Speaker 1: I was like you're a cult.

438
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:20,406
Speaker 1: They're like, no, we're not and the argument really didn't get much beyond that.

439
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:21,450
Speaker 1: But that's beside the point.

440
00:31:21,651 --> 00:31:22,996
Speaker 1: Yeah, Scientology is on the chart.

441
00:31:23,016 --> 00:31:33,890
Speaker 1: This is a chart of all the world religions and one if you read through it like I know a lot of people have heard about Gnosticism because Christianity is in many ways based on some of the ideas of Gnosticism.

442
00:31:34,512 --> 00:31:40,530
Speaker 1: But I have not met many people in the world who know what Gnosticism entails and this is well not a perfect.

443
00:31:41,394 --> 00:31:49,550
Speaker 1: It is a better explanation that I've heard Given by almost anyone in my life other than people I know they know about it.

444
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:53,949
Speaker 0: The other interesting is they cover a lot of those little religions that you don't really know anything like Jane ism.

445
00:31:54,451 --> 00:32:00,269
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's one religion like I've when we went to Israel There was a religion like these people.

446
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,056
Speaker 0: They were so small.

447
00:32:02,096 --> 00:32:06,070
Speaker 0: They literally had one village was the whole religion and they also had a village in Egypt.

448
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,535
Speaker 0: It was like two villages and that was it.

449
00:32:08,017 --> 00:32:13,634
Speaker 1: I mean, it's got like Shinto and the six and Zoroastrianism and Mormonism Christianity's all lumped into one.

450
00:32:13,654 --> 00:32:18,170
Speaker 1: but that's because it covers the basic basic the things that all they split Catholic out though.

451
00:32:18,291 --> 00:32:20,842
Speaker 1: No, no, because it goes so basic.

452
00:32:20,922 --> 00:32:22,630
Speaker 0: I would say Catholic Protestant.

453
00:32:22,992 --> 00:32:24,117
Speaker 1: Well, no because Catholic.

454
00:32:24,158 --> 00:32:26,630
Speaker 1: well Mormon is separate but Catholic and Protestant.

455
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:32,550
Speaker 1: While they disagree on a lot of things at the very very core, they're mostly identical.

456
00:32:32,831 --> 00:32:35,927
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just all the mysticism and spirituality and stuff beyond.

457
00:32:35,948 --> 00:32:36,430
Speaker 1: that is different.

458
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:44,214
Speaker 1: But the interesting thing is they also have some stats as to how many people adhere to or in the case of atheism Don't adhere to.

459
00:32:44,274 --> 00:32:46,159
Speaker 0: yeah, they're very rough estimates.

460
00:32:46,721 --> 00:32:48,747
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there are a lot more atheists.

461
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:49,870
Speaker 0: Well, it's ever the small religions.

462
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:50,914
Speaker 0: It's very easy to know.

463
00:32:50,934 --> 00:32:52,219
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's eight guys.

464
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:53,343
Speaker 1: They live in Long Island.

465
00:32:53,403 --> 00:32:54,507
Speaker 0: There's 70,000 people.

466
00:32:54,547 --> 00:32:55,230
Speaker 0: they live in the city.

467
00:32:55,773 --> 00:33:04,599
Speaker 1: But yeah atheism is trickier because they use a. I mean There's anti theism, you know positive and negative atheism Like there's some atheists who there is no God.

468
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:07,168
Speaker 1: and I'm sure there's atheists who like I just don't believe in anything.

469
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:07,770
Speaker 1: and atheists who?

470
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:08,231
Speaker 1: I don't know.

471
00:33:08,271 --> 00:33:08,814
Speaker 1: I don't care.

472
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:09,999
Speaker 1: They're agnostics.

473
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,410
Speaker 1: They're you know, all these sorts of shades of gray.

474
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,898
Speaker 1: They lumped them all into one as non religious.

475
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:15,560
Speaker 1: Yep.

476
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,870
Speaker 1: There are a lot of non religious people like a billion non religious people.

477
00:33:19,273 --> 00:33:21,650
Speaker 0: Yep, the Muslims give us a run for our money.

478
00:33:24,396 --> 00:33:25,038
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

479
00:33:25,099 --> 00:33:28,329
Speaker 1: maybe we'll have some sort of halo tournament to settle that once and for all.

480
00:33:32,152 --> 00:33:33,430
Speaker 0: What's master chief's religion?

481
00:33:34,613 --> 00:33:39,722
Speaker 1: Master chief ism, obviously but anyway on to our main bit being science and technology day.

482
00:33:39,762 --> 00:33:53,888
Speaker 1: as I've said a lot only because we have so many new listeners and I hope they realize that geek nights has broken up into four distinct days with four distinct sets of topics and Like Tuesdays are gaming Wednesdays anime Thursdays pretty much any geekery that fills in the cracks and voids.

483
00:33:54,429 --> 00:33:59,121
Speaker 1: and We've been doing a long-running series long-running meaning we've done two episodes so far.

484
00:33:59,161 --> 00:34:02,430
Speaker 0: and there's the third episode on how computers work.

485
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,820
Speaker 0: We're going to tell you everything we learned.

486
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:05,423
Speaker 0: that are everything.

487
00:34:05,504 --> 00:34:10,217
Speaker 0: I learned at RIT at least And then after that, we'll tell you everything rim learned.

488
00:34:10,558 --> 00:34:14,969
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're getting basically a free RIT CS and IT education.

489
00:34:15,632 --> 00:34:23,436
Speaker 1: Now this will take us a long time partly because the only time we'll do another episode of the series is when we don't come Up with a better idea for a Monday.

490
00:34:23,456 --> 00:34:23,857
Speaker 1: Yep.

491
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,027
Speaker 0: It was basically due to lack of ideas for a Monday.

492
00:34:27,088 --> 00:34:29,922
Speaker 0: We came up Alright, we'll do a long-running series to fill in the gaps.

493
00:34:30,204 --> 00:34:31,330
Speaker 1: I mean this will take us years.

494
00:34:31,491 --> 00:34:33,417
Speaker 1: There's a lot of things I could talk about.

495
00:34:33,437 --> 00:34:34,641
Speaker 1: I mean right now.

496
00:34:34,762 --> 00:34:36,949
Speaker 1: I'm looking at all the books in front of me on my desk.

497
00:34:37,072 --> 00:34:45,402
Speaker 1: I mean network printing HTML Perl ASP yep, Java will eventually get there.

498
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:50,440
Speaker 0: Yep, but right today We're still on the low low levels now.

499
00:34:50,481 --> 00:34:51,163
Speaker 1: We left off.

500
00:34:51,485 --> 00:34:56,184
Speaker 1: we had basically come up with Binary logic logic gates, you know Turing machines.

501
00:34:56,646 --> 00:34:59,358
Speaker 1: input output Input comes in this.

502
00:34:59,498 --> 00:35:04,036
Speaker 1: if for any given input the output will always be the same Everything is fully deterministic.

503
00:35:04,457 --> 00:35:08,670
Speaker 1: you put data in and then the data is manipulated and it comes back out with electricity.

504
00:35:09,032 --> 00:35:10,300
Speaker 0: That's what a computer is.

505
00:35:10,844 --> 00:35:11,810
Speaker 1: well to a point.

506
00:35:11,931 --> 00:35:14,370
Speaker 1: I mean what we described what we brought together.

507
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:18,669
Speaker 1: You know a bunch of logic gates and for every signal you put in a deterministic signal will come out.

508
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:21,789
Speaker 1: That can't do much other than calculate one thing.

509
00:35:22,572 --> 00:35:28,170
Speaker 1: How do you get from calculating one thing to calculating more than one thing like computers do?

510
00:35:28,992 --> 00:35:29,609
Speaker 0: It's tricky.

511
00:35:29,851 --> 00:35:37,324
Speaker 0: I mean if you just set up a bunch of logic gates sure you could put in one number here and one number there And then a number comes out, but that's all it can do.

512
00:35:37,404 --> 00:35:38,490
Speaker 0: it can't do anything else.

513
00:35:38,851 --> 00:35:53,557
Speaker 0: You need to make a whole different chip to do different things and in fact couldn't do a lot of advanced things like What if you wanted like, you know to I don't know add something together Remember that number and then add something to that.

514
00:35:53,899 --> 00:36:05,514
Speaker 1: basically at this point you would need an entire Computer an entire Turing machine for every possible question or every possible problem You could ever solve.

515
00:36:05,895 --> 00:36:10,610
Speaker 1: I mean down to one plus one and one plus two are two separate computers.

516
00:36:10,893 --> 00:36:11,782
Speaker 0: No, not really.

517
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:12,590
Speaker 0: You just need an adder.

518
00:36:13,531 --> 00:36:18,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'm hiding would need a different computer from subtracting would need a different computer for multiplying.

519
00:36:18,892 --> 00:36:22,270
Speaker 0: And if you wanted to use bigger numbers to add and subtract you would need bigger.

520
00:36:22,591 --> 00:36:28,650
Speaker 1: You wanted to and you would need more and more switches if you wanted to add more numbers like three numbers instead of two.

521
00:36:29,091 --> 00:36:34,856
Speaker 0: So to do most adding I mean to add any two numbers you would need like Any two reasonable numbers.

522
00:36:34,876 --> 00:36:43,309
Speaker 0: you need 64 switches and then if you wanted to add three numbers together Well, you need another computer that had like god knows how many switches on it.

523
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:48,132
Speaker 1: It's just a crazy and nothing could remember anything and basically the computer is useless Yep.

524
00:36:48,553 --> 00:36:51,904
Speaker 1: Now we said that there's one other component in addition to the logic gates.

525
00:36:51,944 --> 00:36:53,830
Speaker 0: This was I think the answer to a trivia question.

526
00:36:53,950 --> 00:37:00,994
Speaker 1: Yep, I mean we said and or you know all those logic gates nor X or X Etc.

527
00:37:01,115 --> 00:37:01,296
Speaker 0: Yep.

528
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,918
Speaker 1: Now there was one component missing and No one actually bothered to answer it.

529
00:37:04,938 --> 00:37:06,526
Speaker 1: I don't think or if they did it's been so long.

530
00:37:06,546 --> 00:37:06,988
Speaker 1: I forgot.

531
00:37:07,129 --> 00:37:09,690
Speaker 0: Yep Well, the answer is a flip-flop.

532
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:14,063
Speaker 1: Now a flip-flop can be somewhat complex electronically.

533
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:20,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are many different kinds of flip-flops So we're not gonna go over that because it's not necessary to know that unless you're going to go into electronics.

534
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:23,119
Speaker 1: Yes conceptually in terms of what it does.

535
00:37:23,179 --> 00:37:24,243
Speaker 1: It's actually very simple.

536
00:37:24,764 --> 00:37:34,650
Speaker 1: It remembers one bit It can remember something you can put a bit into it and the bit will stay there And if you tell it to shoot the bit back out, it'll shoot the bit.

537
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,959
Speaker 0: Well, it's it constantly shoots the bit out.

538
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,708
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, it happens to be so if you choose to listen to it Then you'll get the bit back.

539
00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:46,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically a flip-flop is actually a combination of gates and it can be advanced or not advanced.

540
00:37:46,591 --> 00:37:48,910
Speaker 0: But what it does is it remembers a bit?

541
00:37:49,130 --> 00:38:01,369
Speaker 0: So let's see of a flip-flop and right now it's zero which is no electricity you can send in a one and the flip-flop will change to one and It'll constantly output one.

542
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:11,754
Speaker 0: And then you can change it to zero or keep it at one and it will constantly shoot out one or zero Whatever happens to be in the flip-flop and it'll do that Basically forever.

543
00:38:11,854 --> 00:38:20,590
Speaker 0: so you can do some math and then the result of that math Will do something to the flip-flop or to the whole mess of flip-flops.

544
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,479
Speaker 0: Let's say you have a whole mess of these guys, right?

545
00:38:22,499 --> 00:38:27,839
Speaker 0: So let's say I have a 32 flip-flops I do some adding and the result goes into.

546
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:31,830
Speaker 0: 32 is a 32-bit number which goes into 32 flip-flops.

547
00:38:32,572 --> 00:38:37,487
Speaker 0: Then I take the output of all those flip-flops send them back into the input to add something else.

548
00:38:37,507 --> 00:38:38,390
Speaker 0: Holy crap.

549
00:38:38,701 --> 00:38:43,969
Speaker 1: Yep Now if the machine you had the the input output loop was just add one to whatever number came in.

550
00:38:44,493 --> 00:38:46,566
Speaker 1: You'll just keep adding up and you'll have a little counting machine.

551
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:47,695
Speaker 0: Yep Now what?

552
00:38:47,735 --> 00:38:54,628
Speaker 0: if I want to do like, you know I do something and then I want to say if the last thing I did was this then do this next.

553
00:38:54,728 --> 00:38:56,899
Speaker 0: or if the last Thing I did was this then do something else.

554
00:38:56,979 --> 00:38:58,950
Speaker 0: next you have a flip-flop goes.

555
00:39:00,072 --> 00:39:04,868
Speaker 0: So you just look at the flip-flop to see what you just did because it can remember things.

556
00:39:05,389 --> 00:39:11,130
Speaker 1: now If this doesn't seem like a huge leap or like an amazing thing consider for a minute.

557
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:15,090
Speaker 1: I mean we've added the ability of our Turing machine to remember something.

558
00:39:15,592 --> 00:39:18,123
Speaker 1: So before I add one and one I get to.

559
00:39:18,485 --> 00:39:20,393
Speaker 1: if I want to do anything else I forget to.

560
00:39:20,473 --> 00:39:21,437
Speaker 1: I forget to even exist.

561
00:39:21,477 --> 00:39:23,183
Speaker 0: It's not really a Turing machine, but whatever.

562
00:39:23,304 --> 00:39:27,662
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're real simple here I mean people real simple Turing machines.

563
00:39:27,883 --> 00:39:29,550
Speaker 1: I think we explained the concept pretty well.

564
00:39:29,641 --> 00:39:31,496
Speaker 0: No We didn't explain the concept of Turing machine at all.

565
00:39:31,657 --> 00:39:36,318
Speaker 1: right because Kate borrowed my copy of diamond age that had the awesome thing I wanted to read to everyone.

566
00:39:36,438 --> 00:39:38,070
Speaker 0: We never talked about a Turing machine at all.

567
00:39:38,231 --> 00:39:40,085
Speaker 1: All right, we'll talk about that whenever I get my book back.

568
00:39:40,186 --> 00:39:43,686
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, but I add one and one I get to.

569
00:39:43,706 --> 00:39:45,674
Speaker 1: if I want to add anything else I forget to now.

570
00:39:45,714 --> 00:39:47,461
Speaker 1: I can remember to and do something else.

571
00:39:47,842 --> 00:39:49,829
Speaker 1: or I can remember to and do something with two.

572
00:39:50,533 --> 00:39:52,263
Speaker 1: Or I can remember the order.

573
00:39:52,303 --> 00:39:55,054
Speaker 1: I did things in Mm-hmm that that's.

574
00:39:55,175 --> 00:39:55,716
Speaker 1: that's huge.

575
00:39:55,776 --> 00:39:57,682
Speaker 1: that makes the leap from nothing.

576
00:39:57,843 --> 00:40:00,350
Speaker 1: or you know a one operation thing to a computer.

577
00:40:00,985 --> 00:40:21,529
Speaker 0: Yep I mean you just get a whole mess of flip-flops in there and you can get them to flip and it's basically a bunch of switches that stay switched as Opposed to switches that you have to switch yourself, and yeah And they basically they change based on what you just did Before or what you did two times ago, or what you did three times ago.

578
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:35,981
Speaker 0: Now the way a flip-flop kind of works, I'm not gonna go too much into it is that there is really three inputs Generally, but really only one that you care about.

579
00:40:36,242 --> 00:40:37,968
Speaker 1: you'd better get it because I'm not editing anything.

580
00:40:38,209 --> 00:40:43,293
Speaker 0: Yep so there's a clock and Let's see.

581
00:40:43,314 --> 00:40:46,030
Speaker 0: Let's just do an advanced flip-flop the one that people use.

582
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:57,514
Speaker 0: It's actually called a latch because it's there's a. there's a flip-flop that doesn't have a clock input which is like a set reset flip-flop, but the D latch is the Advanced kind.

583
00:40:57,915 --> 00:41:05,238
Speaker 0: the way it works is it has an input line which can be 0 or 1. it has a clock Which is a clock which I'm going to talk about.

584
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,210
Speaker 0: it has an output and then it has another output.

585
00:41:08,331 --> 00:41:10,390
Speaker 0: That is always the opposite of the other output.

586
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:14,306
Speaker 0: So, you know you can just use that if or not use that at your will.

587
00:41:14,647 --> 00:41:15,330
Speaker 0: now a clock.

588
00:41:15,892 --> 00:41:17,159
Speaker 0: This is where we get into stuff.

589
00:41:17,621 --> 00:41:23,604
Speaker 0: a clock is an input But it's not an input that you control or anything.

590
00:41:23,805 --> 00:41:24,888
Speaker 0: It's simply a clock.

591
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:27,498
Speaker 0: as in 1 0 0 0 1 0 0. it's deterministic.

592
00:41:30,471 --> 00:41:31,515
Speaker 1: Temporally it is.

593
00:41:31,535 --> 00:41:35,690
Speaker 1: it is always giving out a reliable stream of binary data.

594
00:41:36,132 --> 00:41:41,636
Speaker 0: It just gives out ones on you know or zeros at Specific intervals.

595
00:41:41,978 --> 00:41:44,007
Speaker 1: now to shoot up to high level.

596
00:41:44,067 --> 00:41:47,829
Speaker 1: very briefly You know how people have a CPU or computer and they talk about the megahertz.

597
00:41:48,352 --> 00:41:49,536
Speaker 0: The megahertz is the clock.

598
00:41:49,897 --> 00:41:52,547
Speaker 1: That's how fast the clock is going because every time the clock goes.

599
00:41:52,828 --> 00:41:59,069
Speaker 1: Hey, hey Hey, it's Ted's going do something do something and the processor can do something if there's something to do.

600
00:41:59,552 --> 00:42:06,469
Speaker 1: so the more times it says Hey per second the more things your computer can do in a second and therefore the faster it is.

601
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:17,675
Speaker 0: Yes You have a bunch of crazy circuits and gates and stuff all arranged with flip-flops in there and the flip-flops Can change.

602
00:42:17,756 --> 00:42:25,190
Speaker 0: that's when they do change and Then the clock says zero and the flip-flops don't do anything and then the cock says one and all the flip-flops change now.

603
00:42:25,451 --> 00:42:36,648
Speaker 0: So if your circuits are set up to where the results are, you know finished doing things fast enough You can send in the ones more often and your computer will do things faster.

604
00:42:37,029 --> 00:42:47,710
Speaker 1: Yep Now it's not a great reliable factor to determine how fast a computer is overall anymore Because chips have gotten more complex to where they can do more on a given.

605
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:53,230
Speaker 1: Hey do something than older chips and all sorts of other things that we'll talk about far in the future of this series.

606
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:57,187
Speaker 0: Yes but let's say you had a computer that had one flip-flop and it was one hurt.

607
00:42:57,609 --> 00:43:05,309
Speaker 0: the One hurt means that once a second the flip-flop changes, which means the computer basically does one whatever it does.

608
00:43:05,992 --> 00:43:10,850
Speaker 0: Changing the flip-flop once a second if it was a mega hurt it would do it a million times a second.

609
00:43:11,252 --> 00:43:16,298
Speaker 0: But if you had more flip-flops, you know and a much more complex processor It gets crazy.

610
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:23,310
Speaker 0: and you you know It's much faster to have more of them at a slower speed than fewer to higher speed and you got it's crazy.

611
00:43:23,712 --> 00:43:25,281
Speaker 1: Yep, and keep in mind this is.

612
00:43:25,422 --> 00:43:26,750
Speaker 1: I mean this sounds like a very simple thing.

613
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:31,604
Speaker 1: I mean you you've saved one bit in a flip-flop one actually in a real computer.

614
00:43:31,624 --> 00:43:33,590
Speaker 0: There are kajillions of flip-flops going on.

615
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:40,370
Speaker 1: Yep I mean we're talking such low level and I mean zoom out a lot and there are billions and billions and billions of these things.

616
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:42,596
Speaker 1: Your computer flip-flopping constantly.

617
00:43:42,616 --> 00:43:43,198
Speaker 1: Yep.

618
00:43:43,399 --> 00:43:45,505
Speaker 1: Computers are extremely complex.

619
00:43:45,966 --> 00:43:51,529
Speaker 0: from a high modern computers Yeah from a high level you can make something that is technically a computer with very very few.

620
00:43:51,714 --> 00:43:51,798
Speaker 0: Yep.

621
00:43:52,312 --> 00:44:00,502
Speaker 1: but the computer sitting in front of you now or in your iPod is doing an Incredibly insane number of these flip-flops and gates per second millions upon millions.

622
00:44:00,742 --> 00:44:01,063
Speaker 1: and it's.

623
00:44:01,304 --> 00:44:06,746
Speaker 1: it's very conceptually complex yet at its root It's doing a very very simple things.

624
00:44:06,967 --> 00:44:08,535
Speaker 1: a lot Mm-hmm, like.

625
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:11,230
Speaker 1: there are now functions that do this more efficiently.

626
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:17,788
Speaker 1: But early computer chips like adders, right if you wanted to multiply a number you added it a bunch of times.

627
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:25,150
Speaker 1: now There are special functions that can do matrix Transformations and multiply things in one step or in different numbers of steps and do different fun things.

628
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:27,258
Speaker 1: But it used to be and consider.

629
00:44:27,278 --> 00:44:30,550
Speaker 1: This is more of a broad analogy that you do a very simple thing.

630
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:32,948
Speaker 1: I mean adding is simpler than multiplying.

631
00:44:33,711 --> 00:44:43,460
Speaker 1: So if you want to add if you want to multiply 9 times 9 you add 9 to 9 9 times And if you wanted to subtract you just added negative numbers.

632
00:44:43,841 --> 00:44:45,425
Speaker 0: Yep, you know dividing.

633
00:44:45,565 --> 00:44:46,548
Speaker 0: Well, that's crazy.

634
00:44:46,588 --> 00:44:48,274
Speaker 0: But yeah Yeah, yeah, we're.

635
00:44:48,595 --> 00:44:52,630
Speaker 1: we don't want to talk more about binary math because people had trouble with that and enough.

636
00:44:53,172 --> 00:44:57,650
Speaker 1: I think we'll do a whole show on that completely separate like how to add and subtract and multiply and divide binary.

637
00:44:57,791 --> 00:45:06,383
Speaker 0: yes, what's important to know is that the flip-flop or the latch is a Electronic component that can remember a bit.

638
00:45:06,724 --> 00:45:13,828
Speaker 0: it can remember zero or one Whereas in a normal and a what we were talking about before there was no way to remember a zero one.

639
00:45:13,848 --> 00:45:25,490
Speaker 0: now You can remember it which means you can do something based on What you did before as opposed to just doing something then doing something else and then doing something else.

640
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:26,373
Speaker 0: You can do something.

641
00:45:26,674 --> 00:45:35,081
Speaker 0: then based on the result of what you did do something and then based on the result of that do something and you can build upon things.

642
00:45:35,121 --> 00:45:40,640
Speaker 0: you can set an option and then Based on that option do something.

643
00:45:41,162 --> 00:45:44,736
Speaker 0: you can change modes you can change settings You can change all sorts of things.

644
00:45:45,098 --> 00:45:47,570
Speaker 0: You just need more flip-flops to have more complex things.

645
00:45:47,891 --> 00:45:52,210
Speaker 1: Yep, and if you keep making more and more flip-flops you can do more and more and more and it gets more and more complex.

646
00:45:52,311 --> 00:45:54,748
Speaker 1: But it's still just these basic little things flipping back and forth.

647
00:45:55,191 --> 00:45:59,810
Speaker 1: Yep, now that the terms here involved are basically you have a stateless computer.

648
00:46:00,453 --> 00:46:08,187
Speaker 1: It doesn't remember anything like when you add what Scott just said the flip-flops You know have a stateful computer as in the state of things matters.

649
00:46:08,609 --> 00:46:11,230
Speaker 0: Yep So let's say you have a computer with two flip-flops in it.

650
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,159
Speaker 0: That means there's four possible states.

651
00:46:13,279 --> 00:46:14,606
Speaker 0: both flip-flops are zero.

652
00:46:14,746 --> 00:46:16,579
Speaker 0: one of them is one The other one is one.

653
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:17,829
Speaker 0: they're both one four states.

654
00:46:18,432 --> 00:46:22,306
Speaker 1: So in a computer fanatical devotion to the Pope five five states.

655
00:46:22,827 --> 00:46:24,085
Speaker 0: Yeah Connecticut.

656
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:33,790
Speaker 0: So now depending on you could have a computer where depending on which of the four states it's in it does something completely different.

657
00:46:34,171 --> 00:46:43,590
Speaker 0: yeah, because that one bit of or two bits of output from the flip-flops are going into the computer and Changing the way the computer works like a nice example.

658
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:45,276
Speaker 1: That's probably in front of many of you right now.

659
00:46:45,336 --> 00:46:49,030
Speaker 1: Look at your computer monitor or the screen on your iPod your Zen or whatever.

660
00:46:49,452 --> 00:46:49,954
Speaker 1: There's a whole.

661
00:46:50,014 --> 00:46:52,947
Speaker 1: there's basically not gonna talk about video buffers and all that.

662
00:46:52,988 --> 00:47:02,615
Speaker 1: but there's a place of flip-flops where every little pixel on your screen is just a bunch of flip-flops storing the data of What should appear on that pixel?

663
00:47:02,635 --> 00:47:06,450
Speaker 1: It's just a matrix of data and all that is is just a whole bunch of flip-flops.

664
00:47:07,092 --> 00:47:07,675
Speaker 0: Well, they don't.

665
00:47:07,735 --> 00:47:11,410
Speaker 0: actually I don't think those chips actually well now that flops but that's not the point.

666
00:47:11,631 --> 00:47:12,796
Speaker 0: They use your memory.

667
00:47:12,816 --> 00:47:13,761
Speaker 1: They use remembering.

668
00:47:13,962 --> 00:47:15,710
Speaker 1: Yes, things can remember in different ways.

669
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:20,344
Speaker 0: In fact, there's a flip-flop is the basic electronic means of remembering their other means.

670
00:47:20,444 --> 00:47:29,504
Speaker 1: but don't worry about I may be corrected by one of our listeners, but as far as I know the only Computer components that really use flip-flops a lot now are like registers in CPUs.

671
00:47:29,565 --> 00:47:29,805
Speaker 0: Yep.

672
00:47:30,266 --> 00:47:31,610
Speaker 0: That's that's basically where they're found.

673
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:33,357
Speaker 1: I don't think there's anywhere else they're used anymore.

674
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,570
Speaker 0: No hard drives use magnetic means of memory.

675
00:47:36,851 --> 00:47:39,500
Speaker 1: Yep, RAM uses basically capacitors though.

676
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,430
Speaker 1: There are different kinds of RAM, but that's that's way beyond.

677
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:47,167
Speaker 0: Yeah, your BIOS uses what's the equivalent of very small circuit breakers?

678
00:47:47,869 --> 00:47:53,770
Speaker 1: Yep We'll talk about all of these in kind if you because if they sound cool these this is actually where things start getting cool.

679
00:47:54,191 --> 00:48:00,049
Speaker 0: Yep, it is different ways of basically storing information and remembering it until later.

680
00:48:00,571 --> 00:48:03,584
Speaker 0: Yeah, because you flip-flop is just the basic component.

681
00:48:03,664 --> 00:48:04,789
Speaker 0: it stores one bit.

682
00:48:05,353 --> 00:48:12,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I kept saying flip-flop but with the screen example It's remembering every one of those things just an array of things that remembered the state of something.

683
00:48:12,444 --> 00:48:17,870
Speaker 0: Yeah If you change there's an array of pretend they're flip-flops that remember zeros and ones.

684
00:48:18,492 --> 00:48:22,689
Speaker 0: So you do some math and you figure out what the output of this on the screen should be.

685
00:48:23,172 --> 00:48:25,650
Speaker 0: You send it in and it modifies all these flip-flops.

686
00:48:26,071 --> 00:48:30,809
Speaker 0: Then there's another device that reads those flip-flops and creates the image on your screen based on that.

687
00:48:31,672 --> 00:48:36,170
Speaker 0: Those flip-flops remember what the screen is supposed to look like until you change it again.

688
00:48:36,451 --> 00:48:43,727
Speaker 1: So if I want to draw a square I run a set of instructions that usually those instructions are stored About instructions next time.

689
00:48:43,808 --> 00:48:53,130
Speaker 1: Yep But basically just a bunch of gates or a bunch of equations or a bunch of numbers that go in a certain way To create the math that will put into those flip-flops or those memory bits.

690
00:48:53,451 --> 00:48:59,327
Speaker 0: It will change the flip-flops that need to be changed to make a square because that is all your computer does.

691
00:48:59,648 --> 00:49:12,880
Speaker 1: it takes input it saves it to memory or it manipulates memory with that data and all you're doing is Changing ones to zeros and zeros to ones and ones to ones again and zeros to zeros again.

692
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:13,320
Speaker 0: Yep.

693
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:23,878
Speaker 0: So in conclusion, you know a a computer is input from the human being or from devices such as you know I know a light sensor or a keyboard or a mouse or who knows what?

694
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:31,946
Speaker 0: Goes and is processed somehow and then is outputted to a printer or a monitor or a speaker The flip-flops.

695
00:49:32,147 --> 00:49:35,300
Speaker 0: what they do is they are in the processing area.

696
00:49:35,781 --> 00:49:37,185
Speaker 0: So you put some input.

697
00:49:37,506 --> 00:49:42,800
Speaker 0: there is processing and output but in the course of that processing some things are remembered.

698
00:49:43,363 --> 00:49:48,525
Speaker 0: so that way you give another input and The processing is different.

699
00:49:48,746 --> 00:49:57,051
Speaker 0: because you know, it's the prod the input that you gave before Matters not just the input you gave right now now.

700
00:49:57,572 --> 00:49:59,860
Speaker 1: We've gotten feedback as we've done this series, right?

701
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,265
Speaker 1: I think we're done talking about this for today.

702
00:50:01,807 --> 00:50:04,920
Speaker 1: And the first feedback we got was that we were going way too fast.

703
00:50:05,601 --> 00:50:07,759
Speaker 1: We've slowed it down about as slow as we can go.

704
00:50:08,141 --> 00:50:12,293
Speaker 1: So if that's if it sounded like we were repeating ourselves a lot, it's because we were.

705
00:50:12,313 --> 00:50:14,964
Speaker 1: I mean the concept of flip-flops Is.

706
00:50:15,247 --> 00:50:16,238
Speaker 1: there's not much to it.

707
00:50:16,661 --> 00:50:20,739
Speaker 1: So all we did was keep giving more and more analogies and trying to explain it again and again.

708
00:50:21,221 --> 00:50:22,745
Speaker 1: So was that too slow?

709
00:50:22,825 --> 00:50:23,407
Speaker 1: was that right?

710
00:50:23,868 --> 00:50:24,449
Speaker 1: You guys getting it?

711
00:50:24,871 --> 00:50:28,159
Speaker 0: Yeah, we need some more feedback if you guys you know.

712
00:50:29,162 --> 00:50:30,695
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, we're not doing this for us.

713
00:50:30,776 --> 00:50:31,180
Speaker 1: We know it.

714
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:38,060
Speaker 1: We're doing it for you because you were you were interested in how your computer works and we're eventually gonna get to the stuff.

715
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:43,980
Speaker 0: That's closer to what you understand, but this stuff will really give you like a huge insight.

716
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,809
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, we start talking about how email works.

717
00:50:46,929 --> 00:50:50,300
Speaker 0: You'll be like, oh cool, but a lot of it you'd be like, huh?

718
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:58,237
Speaker 0: But that you're talking about this networking stuff and then that networking stuff works on something else which works eventually on the stuff We're talking about right now.

719
00:50:58,601 --> 00:51:08,516
Speaker 1: Plus there are things we'll learn from each other because Scott knows a lot more about the lower workings and the coding than I do Yeah, but when we get to the networking and things like that, I actually did learn things in college.

720
00:51:08,938 --> 00:51:15,340
Speaker 1: Oh my god OMG, OMG, even though honestly I learned more in the working world than I did at RIT.

721
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,207
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

722
00:51:17,348 --> 00:51:18,091
Speaker 0: Yeah.

723
00:51:18,473 --> 00:51:18,794
Speaker 1: Yeah.

724
00:51:18,814 --> 00:51:19,557
Speaker 1: All right.

725
00:51:19,598 --> 00:51:20,160
Speaker 1: That's all we've got.

726
00:51:20,241 --> 00:51:24,607
Speaker 1: Once again, if you're a new listener and you don't care about technology But you still listen to the end of this.

727
00:51:24,969 --> 00:51:27,160
Speaker 1: keep in mind that we talk about different things every day.

728
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,244
Speaker 1: We go four nights a week.

729
00:51:28,746 --> 00:51:32,700
Speaker 1: If you're looking for the Kineticon feedback, it's going to be on Wednesday, which is anime day.

730
00:51:33,102 --> 00:51:34,127
Speaker 0: Yeah, Wednesday night.

731
00:51:34,268 --> 00:51:41,026
Speaker 0: So for most of you schmucks, that means Thursday But you should listen Wednesday night if you're cool And if you don't have anything better to do.

732
00:51:41,447 --> 00:51:47,411
Speaker 1: it seems like a decent portion of our listeners like a good third Listen to the show on about a week lag time.

733
00:51:47,432 --> 00:51:49,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know what's up with that.

734
00:51:49,546 --> 00:51:50,420
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, I don't know.

735
00:51:50,442 --> 00:51:58,994
Speaker 1: I mean maybe it's people who commute or I know a lot of people go through the archives because The oldest episodes on Libsyn are getting three or four downloads every day.

736
00:51:59,014 --> 00:52:08,308
Speaker 0: Yeah to be honest with you If I was a listener of geek nights, I would probably subscribe to just one or two days Because it's just too much to have the four days.

737
00:52:08,488 --> 00:52:10,274
Speaker 1: Well, maybe we should start doing shorter episodes again.

738
00:52:10,695 --> 00:52:21,979
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we're out And that was geek nights with rim and Scott special.
