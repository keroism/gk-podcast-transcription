Speaker 0: we continue getting into it week with getting into anime.

6
00:00:22,152 --> 00:00:23,187
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,843 --> 00:00:28,806
Speaker 0: So at long last.

8
00:00:28,846 --> 00:00:31,293
Speaker 0: the saga of rims computer is nearing its conclusion.

9
00:00:31,674 --> 00:00:32,577
Speaker 0: not gonna talk about it.

10
00:00:32,998 --> 00:00:40,949
Speaker 0: suffice to say Ahead Scott not had the good grace to decide to drive me up to buy another power supply just now.

11
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:51,243
Speaker 0: I Would probably not be doing the show because I'd just be stewing in my own anger and Instead we're here really late starting the show at like 10.

12
00:00:51,243 --> 00:00:53,574
Speaker 1: So it's gonna be a quick show cuz best of all.

13
00:00:53,594 --> 00:00:55,979
Speaker 0: we thought Oh, we'll just eat on the way home.

14
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:03,025
Speaker 0: But all the quick food places that weren't fast food were closed because it was late, and we're not in New York City We're upstate where everything closes.

15
00:01:03,447 --> 00:01:05,696
Speaker 1: Yeah, so yeah, I really got to keep shit open.

16
00:01:05,737 --> 00:01:06,560
Speaker 1: if they want to make money

17
00:01:06,862 --> 00:01:18,440
Speaker 0: I really miss the days when I was in college And if it was 2 45 in the morning And I wanted some falafel or a chicken pita I could go to the pita pit and get it and then get a fresh doughnut right next door at the Krispy Kreme.

18
00:01:18,761 --> 00:01:20,206
Speaker 1: Yep, those are the days.

19
00:01:20,226 --> 00:01:21,430
Speaker 0: those were good days.

20
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:22,252
Speaker 1: well.

21
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,319
Speaker 1: Let's get right into it here cuz I can go to bed.

22
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:25,824
Speaker 1: news.

23
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:28,125
Speaker 1: Anime Expo a convention.

24
00:01:28,145 --> 00:01:29,188
Speaker 1: We've never been to that.

25
00:01:29,228 --> 00:01:33,554
Speaker 1: we often say not the greatest things about even though We've never been there.

26
00:01:33,574 --> 00:01:37,180
Speaker 0: granted We've said not the greatest things about a great many conventions in the past.

27
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,719
Speaker 0: So it's no really big skin off of anime Expos back Yeah But it is the biggest anime convention in the u.s.

28
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:51,793
Speaker 1: Even though the actual size of it may be up for debate it is the biggest and they have announced Possibly the biggest event ever.

29
00:01:51,813 --> 00:01:53,760
Speaker 0: I mean before this.

30
00:01:54,422 --> 00:02:00,722
Speaker 0: I think that the lark concert at Otakon was probably one of the biggest just in terms of the the sheer Excitement.

31
00:02:00,762 --> 00:02:06,680
Speaker 0: and how many people came to Otakon just to see them and how many people flew from Japan to Baltimore?

32
00:02:07,182 --> 00:02:09,249
Speaker 0: Just to see them in Baltimore.

33
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:09,852
Speaker 1: Yep.

34
00:02:10,394 --> 00:02:22,120
Speaker 1: Well, there is a new band I'm pretty sure it's new that is going to perform at anime Expo on June 29th 2007. the band is called skin the four members of the band.

35
00:02:22,481 --> 00:02:26,160
Speaker 1: I only know two of them, but the fact that I know two of them is kind of crazy.

36
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:30,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, Scott doesn't listen to so much of the j-pop or the well most of the j-rock.

37
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,348
Speaker 1: Yeah, the two band members.

38
00:02:32,408 --> 00:02:35,745
Speaker 1: I do not know are Sugi's oh and Miyabi.

39
00:02:36,148 --> 00:02:37,375
Speaker 0: so I know Miyabi.

40
00:02:37,556 --> 00:02:38,059
Speaker 1: Who is that?

41
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:45,040
Speaker 1: Popular, okay, the other two members of the band that I do know are gagged, you know, who's gagged?

42
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:54,195
Speaker 0: Yeah No No I'll point out that gagged by like just the gagged alone Would have been a big deal and a lot of people would have been really excited about that.

43
00:02:54,235 --> 00:02:55,439
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's a crazy awesome guy.

44
00:02:55,459 --> 00:03:01,015
Speaker 1: and Yoshiki who was at Otakon right but didn't actually perform there.

45
00:03:01,155 --> 00:03:04,044
Speaker 0: if I didn't actually see him I'm pretty sure it was there.

46
00:03:04,566 --> 00:03:04,907
Speaker 1: You've got.

47
00:03:04,947 --> 00:03:08,738
Speaker 1: those four people have combined to make one band.

48
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:22,509
Speaker 1: It's like Man, it's sort of like imagine if I don't know like John John bottom and John and May be Hendrix and it's bad.

49
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:31,017
Speaker 1: It's like an all-star band in a way and I'm pretty sure this is their first performance ever at anime Expo in the u.s.

50
00:03:31,298 --> 00:03:33,726
Speaker 1: Which is Stupidly crazy.

51
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:40,240
Speaker 0: I can't imagine how we should have a betting pool And how many people at anime Expo are going to be Japanese?

52
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,753
Speaker 0: Citizens who have flown to America for this concert and this concert alone.

53
00:03:44,014 --> 00:03:45,740
Speaker 1: I bet at least a thousand.

54
00:03:46,021 --> 00:03:48,848
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least and that's a pretty conservative estimate here.

55
00:03:48,908 --> 00:03:50,593
Speaker 1: They're any conservative probably 2000.

56
00:03:50,593 --> 00:03:53,200
Speaker 1: But yeah, this is crazy.

57
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:57,240
Speaker 1: There's not much else I can say about it, except it's absolutely insane.

58
00:03:58,084 --> 00:04:00,880
Speaker 1: I think you should be aware of it, especially for on the west coast.

59
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:07,460
Speaker 0: I wouldn't be surprised if the Generally extremely warm reception that Japanese bands get when they come to the u.s.

60
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,977
Speaker 0: And perform at conventions is not pushing more of the bigger names to want to come to the u.s.

61
00:04:13,017 --> 00:04:13,759
Speaker 0: To do concerts.

62
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,678
Speaker 1: It could be could be and better for us.

63
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:25,198
Speaker 0: Yeah, even though they still don't quite get that Americans aren't willing to pay, you know, $35 for a CD But you know what?

64
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:33,365
Speaker 1: Otakon still has not announced his musical acts if I am correct, and it just might be the same They might come across.

65
00:04:33,405 --> 00:04:34,990
Speaker 0: who know is that that your speculation?

66
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,815
Speaker 1: That's it's a slight speculation.

67
00:04:37,136 --> 00:04:38,540
Speaker 0: I don't stand by that speculation.

68
00:04:38,982 --> 00:04:41,355
Speaker 1: However, were that the case I give it a 20% chance.

69
00:04:42,762 --> 00:04:54,712
Speaker 1: I don't know what I do because Otakon is already pretty bad as even though they never answer my goddamn emails Yeah, Otakon the biggest best convention on the East Coast doesn't answer email But the tiny-ass conventions they answer the email right away.

70
00:04:54,732 --> 00:04:56,359
Speaker 0: Yeah, honestly though, it's not.

71
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,848
Speaker 0: I mean I can't say like oh, it's just this year.

72
00:04:57,888 --> 00:04:59,639
Speaker 0: Otakon has never really gotten back with me.

73
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,506
Speaker 1: That's Otakon's number one problem.

74
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:02,991
Speaker 1: It's like they seem to do everything else.

75
00:05:03,072 --> 00:05:05,400
Speaker 1: Well, except answer people's email.

76
00:05:05,682 --> 00:05:14,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean God the New York anime festival Which isn't gonna be until December and hasn't really got anything together yet at all and is super corporate.

77
00:05:15,185 --> 00:05:17,100
Speaker 0: They got back with me immediately.

78
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,126
Speaker 0: Like Every time I email them they respond immediately.

79
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:23,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, Connecticut's the same way.

80
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,763
Speaker 0: Anime next.

81
00:05:25,064 --> 00:05:31,220
Speaker 1: so it's not just because Otakon's fan run they can't respond to email their fan run conventions that respond to the email.

82
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:32,464
Speaker 1: It's just Otakon.

83
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:36,577
Speaker 0: granted anime next didn't respond either, but I only tried once through a web form.

84
00:05:36,858 --> 00:05:44,340
Speaker 1: and yeah You can't go through a web form But if you actually email an actual person and that person is the person and they don't reply that's a problem.

85
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:54,148
Speaker 0: Well, honestly the reason I didn't follow up with anime next was that after the sheer amount of crap we're doing at Kineticon and the New York anime festival and Theoretically Otakon.

86
00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:05,808
Speaker 0: I'm not actually sure anymore But I don't know if I'm really prepared vocally physically to do Kineticon and Otakon and anime Next all in the same stint.

87
00:06:05,888 --> 00:06:08,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, besides I was only planning even if we were doing stuff at anime next.

88
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:18,654
Speaker 1: I was only planning to go for like, you know The day on Saturday or look at the schedule see what's happening and pick the day with the best event to go to Or something like that, you know, maybe it'll be Sunday.

89
00:06:18,674 --> 00:06:27,719
Speaker 0: Who knows but yeah We're probably to talk about anime Expo a little bit more in another episode in the news because looking at their website They've definitely kicked it up a notch this year.

90
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:37,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, and while I don't know if previous things you've said about the convention are true or false because we've never been there However, most of those are based on firsthand accounts from people we know.

91
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:49,420
Speaker 1: Yes, but looking at the list of things that they're doing at the next anime next anime Expo at the end of this month It's looking like something I would definitely want to be at the based on the events alone.

92
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,773
Speaker 0: The only problem with going to the anime Expo.

93
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:52,940
Speaker 1: It's on the other side of the country.

94
00:06:53,004 --> 00:06:53,721
Speaker 0: No, no that's not.

95
00:06:53,762 --> 00:07:04,020
Speaker 0: that's not really the big issue because I love the East Coast and there's only really three things on the West Coast that Really pull me out that way and they're momentary things transient things like the San Diego Comic Con.

96
00:07:04,636 --> 00:07:18,268
Speaker 0: But If I'm going to go to the West Coast for a convention It's not going to be for anything but packs, which is probably in terms of desire to go Versus I don't know.

97
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:20,060
Speaker 0: pain felt by not going.

98
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:30,626
Speaker 0: Yeah, I want to go to penny arcade Expo more than I want to go to any convention and yet it's just so inconvenient to Go, it's always at the worst time.

99
00:07:31,048 --> 00:07:32,032
Speaker 0: It's so far away.

100
00:07:32,172 --> 00:07:33,879
Speaker 1: I was going to go to anime Expo, right?

101
00:07:34,602 --> 00:07:40,900
Speaker 1: That would mean that I'm already going to packs and I'm still willing to go to the West Coast again.

102
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:48,040
Speaker 1: And then if I was gonna go to the San Diego Comic Con it would be because I'm willing to go to the West Coast three times in one summer.

103
00:07:49,021 --> 00:07:53,620
Speaker 1: You know and it's like, you know, sure you might say why don't you go to one one summer?

104
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,453
Speaker 1: One the next summer and one the next summer.

105
00:07:55,493 --> 00:07:58,433
Speaker 1: Well if I was going to do that I would go to packs packs and packs.

106
00:07:58,473 --> 00:08:08,440
Speaker 0: Yes, because When the first packs happen, I thought oh, I wish I could go to that But I didn't really think anything of it because I would con is frickin amazing Like Otakon is my still my Becca when it comes to geekery.

107
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,594
Speaker 1: But then we saw what happened at the first packs.

108
00:08:10,635 --> 00:08:11,420
Speaker 1: We saw the aftermath.

109
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,365
Speaker 0: Yeah because packs is just.

110
00:08:14,008 --> 00:08:18,278
Speaker 0: I think it's the best geek convention out there because It's up.

111
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,023
Speaker 0: It's not really

112
00:08:19,043 --> 00:08:23,884
Speaker 1: and I can tell just from looking at what happens there based on Report because packs

113
00:08:23,944 --> 00:08:29,983
Speaker 0: is doing for video game cons and webcomic cons what Otakon and all the big anime Video

114
00:08:30,004 --> 00:08:30,486
Speaker 1: game kind

115
00:08:30,727 --> 00:08:36,308
Speaker 0: but wallets a video game con, you know with It's effectively a geek con.

116
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,539
Speaker 0: a lot of people go who aren't super into video games.

117
00:08:38,821 --> 00:08:42,818
Speaker 0: I mean how many people read penny arcade who don't actually play a lot of video games penny arcade.

118
00:08:42,857 --> 00:08:43,380
Speaker 0: Just that funny.

119
00:08:43,601 --> 00:08:46,155
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of people but they at least know about video games.

120
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:49,596
Speaker 0: Yeah Or at least you're there in that geeky kind of culture.

121
00:08:49,636 --> 00:08:50,099
Speaker 1: Let's hurry up.

122
00:08:50,449 --> 00:09:02,122
Speaker 0: Yeah anyway I'm really not gonna bother doing the news because I want to get to the main bit and the motherboard that for the first time since The May 7th when I ordered it It

123
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:06,520
Speaker 1: wouldn't boot with the fancy and tech power supply, but it boots with a piece of shit overpriced Best Buy.

124
00:09:06,621 --> 00:09:11,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, I went and bought like one of those off-brand Crappy power supplies and it works.

125
00:09:11,771 --> 00:09:13,438
Speaker 1: just the best thing Best Buy had.

126
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:19,011
Speaker 0: yes Well sadly Best Buy advertise better things that apparently they don't actually carry.

127
00:09:19,031 --> 00:09:19,492
Speaker 0: Yeah.

128
00:09:19,772 --> 00:09:20,033
Speaker 1: Oh, well.

129
00:09:20,615 --> 00:09:32,829
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we'll get right to the chase here things of the day Since we're moving along right quick here.

130
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:40,250
Speaker 0: I'm sure many of you are aware of this But it's possible that you aren't and even if you aren't it's doubtful.

131
00:09:40,854 --> 00:09:48,835
Speaker 0: Well even if you are it's doubtful that you probably Spent the amount of time watching these things that we did in college Particularly late at night.

132
00:09:48,895 --> 00:09:50,120
Speaker 0: when there was we were bored.

133
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,344
Speaker 0: the night was winding down.

134
00:09:51,384 --> 00:10:02,450
Speaker 1: well in the days before YouTube Right you had actual little video clips that you would download and store on your computer Yeah, and had a folder full of funny clips every person had like their personal collection.

135
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:13,708
Speaker 0: It was like everyone had their own Equivalent of anime hell on their person and whenever you're at someone's house and obviously it's college So you know 3 a.m.. Rolls around you've run out of stuff to talk about.

136
00:10:13,729 --> 00:10:15,474
Speaker 0: you Don't feel like playing games anymore.

137
00:10:15,675 --> 00:10:19,206
Speaker 1: some guy opens up his miscellaneous video folder and plays everything.

138
00:10:19,346 --> 00:10:22,078
Speaker 0: so you watch puddle jumper And you watch.

139
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:27,599
Speaker 0: but hot dog and you watch chaos 9000 or death cast 9000. all those things.

140
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:40,330
Speaker 0: yep, and one of the things that I was in my collection were all of the Celebrity Jeopardy skits from Saturday Night Live which is still in my opinion the best of Saturday Night Live ever.

141
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,676
Speaker 0: Yeah, well except for the Blues Brothers.

142
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:46,326
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that's it, but that's indirectly out of Saturday Night Live.

143
00:10:46,526 --> 00:10:55,913
Speaker 0: Yes anyway of Those I think Sean Connery or Sean Connery the character was perhaps the funniest bit and someone's made.

144
00:10:56,153 --> 00:11:10,409
Speaker 0: and as an SNL compilation of all the Sean Connery bits from all of the SNL Celebrity Jeopardy bits, I'll take the rapist for 900 It'll rue the day truck back yeah.

145
00:11:11,332 --> 00:11:12,417
Speaker 1: So that sounds pretty good to me.

146
00:11:12,457 --> 00:11:13,201
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not gonna.

147
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:16,376
Speaker 0: We will do a show on that or something I don't know on that.

148
00:11:16,496 --> 00:11:16,938
Speaker 1: one thing.

149
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:19,148
Speaker 0: well show on I don't know comedy we like.

150
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,840
Speaker 1: oh It could be a good show on that.

151
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:26,243
Speaker 0: cuz we talk of Monty Python I talk about SNL talk about stand-up comedians the whole thing alright.

152
00:11:26,303 --> 00:11:28,450
Speaker 1: It's just like a good Thursday alright, but watch this video.

153
00:11:28,551 --> 00:11:32,181
Speaker 0: It's funny especially Especially if you've never seen these before.

154
00:11:32,201 --> 00:11:33,327
Speaker 1: mm-hmm all right.

155
00:11:33,347 --> 00:11:33,468
Speaker 1: now.

156
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:36,476
Speaker 1: Here's something that's pretty funny.

157
00:11:36,536 --> 00:11:40,310
Speaker 1: I was gonna save this until we did a Pokemon show, but I'll just use it now cuz I'm lazy.

158
00:11:41,274 --> 00:11:51,984
Speaker 1: You might know that Pokemon is a game and it is an RPG and it does have leveling Special take and it does have the grind which I am not a fan of.

159
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:58,949
Speaker 1: if you have heard me rant about World of Warcraft And is grind I do not like the grind never mind the spelling error.

160
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:02,689
Speaker 0: Yeah That I'm not gonna talk about it yet on the show.

161
00:12:03,252 --> 00:12:12,627
Speaker 0: If anyone out there will point out the spelling error in the new Pokemon or the old Pokemons I'll be thankful, but it pisses me off to the point that I feel dirty playing the game.

162
00:12:12,647 --> 00:12:14,490
Speaker 1: wow That's pretty rough.

163
00:12:14,631 --> 00:12:23,870
Speaker 0: It really bothers me when I run into something like that in a video game especially a Nintendo game Except for old Nintendo games with bad localizations, but that's different right now.

164
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:39,634
Speaker 1: The only reason I say Pokemon is playable is because it is the grind with a little bit on the side that makes it actually Not a grind, but there's also the fact that unlike a lot of MMOs Pokemon does have Extensive endgame combat.

165
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:50,087
Speaker 0: well combat content that content being the cockfighting on the internet or the cockfighting with friends at conventions Which is the only reason not entirely a battle of who has higher level stuff.

166
00:12:50,509 --> 00:13:01,870
Speaker 0: also There's nothing more fun and social than what I expect will be happening at Otacon this year when I whip out my Pokemons Ronder it around and fight with 12 year old kids with their Pokemons.

167
00:13:02,251 --> 00:13:12,950
Speaker 0: Yep, and that's what makes Pokemon acceptable despite its grinding which is not pleasant, but yeah I mean if World of Warcraft is below the line Pokemon is so barely above the line.

168
00:13:13,112 --> 00:13:14,490
Speaker 1: It's just barely above the line.

169
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:20,290
Speaker 1: But here's a guy who has found a way to solve at least some of the grinding problem in Pokemon.

170
00:13:20,671 --> 00:13:26,030
Speaker 1: You might know that in Pokemon there are certain Pokemons which will evolve only when they are very happy.

171
00:13:26,592 --> 00:13:30,550
Speaker 1: So you have like a Golbat, and it won't turn into a Crobat until it really loves you.

172
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,309
Speaker 0: I had no idea about that.

173
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:38,085
Speaker 1: Yeah And one way to make Pokemon love you is to carry them around and keep walking.

174
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:45,729
Speaker 1: well the other way is illegal in most states Yes, but if you keep spending time with Pokemon they will fall in love with you, and they will like you very much.

175
00:13:46,452 --> 00:13:56,050
Speaker 1: So what this guy did is there's a gym leader in the game and in this gym leaders gymnasium There are these arrows on the ground which will force you to move in certain directions.

176
00:13:56,871 --> 00:14:07,263
Speaker 1: So he went to this gym and he found a good position and he took two wrenches and he held down the down arrow and the B button on his DS light and plug the DS into the wall.

177
00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:22,894
Speaker 1: and Basically by doing this he was able to force his character to walk infinitely and thus Over the course of a few hours while he went away and actually you know spent time doing real things lived his real life Lived his real life.

178
00:14:23,255 --> 00:14:26,549
Speaker 1: He was able to evolve six Pokemon, huh?

179
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,130
Speaker 0: That I guess that epitomizes everything that's wrong about games like Pokemon.

180
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,599
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is why grinding is bad.

181
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:40,050
Speaker 1: if it's just a matter of spending time holding down buttons What the fuck is the point in making a person do that?

182
00:14:40,431 --> 00:14:46,010
Speaker 1: I don't understand, but the people who design such a mechanic into a game or thinking it's fine more and more.

183
00:14:46,692 --> 00:14:52,373
Speaker 1: I wish I even understand less people who actually do this sort of thing Manually.

184
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:52,634
Speaker 1: what?

185
00:14:52,955 --> 00:14:56,889
Speaker 1: what kind of lives are they living where they have nothing better to do than hold down two buttons and wait?

186
00:14:57,371 --> 00:15:03,390
Speaker 0: Granted at least Pokemon sets it up so that it's very easy to play Pokemon while living your normal life.

187
00:15:03,973 --> 00:15:07,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I'll just sit there while I'm doing just about anything to level these stupid things up.

188
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:08,574
Speaker 1: I think that is.

189
00:15:08,634 --> 00:15:12,030
Speaker 1: the main difference with Pokemon is that it's such like a side.

190
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,410
Speaker 1: It's like you could do it out of the corner of your eye.

191
00:15:14,671 --> 00:15:17,763
Speaker 1: You just carry it around with you with like one hand on it.

192
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:21,596
Speaker 0: Just pushing buttons without looking I mean and look at us playing Wesnoth.

193
00:15:21,897 --> 00:15:22,940
Speaker 0: It's me Alex and Scott.

194
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,803
Speaker 0: We're playing Wesnoth.

195
00:15:24,104 --> 00:15:26,310
Speaker 0: We're all also playing Pokemon.

196
00:15:26,832 --> 00:15:32,550
Speaker 1: Yep, whereas World of Warcraft seems to be a thing that demands your entire attention or at least more attention than Pokemon.

197
00:15:33,013 --> 00:15:35,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess the people are really really play a lot of Wow.

198
00:15:35,932 --> 00:15:39,710
Speaker 0: I know for a fact that they tend to watch movies and stuff in the corner while they're playing.

199
00:15:39,891 --> 00:15:44,089
Speaker 1: Yeah, but a movie is something I like to get full attention to also, so I don't know.

200
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:49,335
Speaker 0: yeah, well, maybe a crap movie or something I've seen before or Like a Simpsons.

201
00:15:49,796 --> 00:15:50,037
Speaker 1: Yeah.

202
00:15:50,138 --> 00:15:53,170
Speaker 1: Yeah something like that a day killer even so worked.

203
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:53,692
Speaker 1: We're older.

204
00:15:53,712 --> 00:15:59,790
Speaker 1: Warcraft demands more attention to Pokemon and Pokemon is barely over the line and World of Warcraft is under the line.

205
00:16:00,172 --> 00:16:03,307
Speaker 0: Yeah, barely under the line because it's better than all those other MMOs.

206
00:16:03,347 --> 00:16:03,930
Speaker 1: That's for sure.

207
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,639
Speaker 1: It is above all the other MMOs, but still not enough.

208
00:16:07,021 --> 00:16:11,500
Speaker 1: Pokemon is almost so bad It's unplayable, but it makes it over.

209
00:16:11,943 --> 00:16:13,150
Speaker 1: We'll talk about that more in our poke.

210
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:17,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, we will because the fact that I'm playing Pokemon says a lot because I hate games like that.

211
00:16:17,951 --> 00:16:22,426
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, and Pokemon infuriates me slightly less than it entertains me.

212
00:16:22,747 --> 00:16:25,574
Speaker 1: Yep Sums it up right there.

213
00:16:25,594 --> 00:16:35,592
Speaker 1: All right, so the meat of the show gonna do this quick All right It's still getting into it week the week in which we tell you how to get into various geekeries or get your friends into Various geek.

214
00:16:35,672 --> 00:16:39,766
Speaker 0: you might remember last Wednesday when we talked about how to get into a throat infection.

215
00:16:40,488 --> 00:16:43,760
Speaker 0: Oh, right Yes, right Scott is just starting to recover from it.

216
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,302
Speaker 0: I'm fine.

217
00:16:44,322 --> 00:16:45,044
Speaker 1: I didn't have a throat.

218
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:46,610
Speaker 0: Well, no you had the nose infection.

219
00:16:46,771 --> 00:16:47,493
Speaker 0: Yep, I had.

220
00:16:47,514 --> 00:16:51,650
Speaker 1: basically I'm at the stage where my head is full of mucus and I can't get it out.

221
00:16:52,071 --> 00:16:54,883
Speaker 0: I think you should take one more Nyquil and then you'll be fine.

222
00:16:54,903 --> 00:16:55,907
Speaker 1: There's no more Nyquil left.

223
00:16:56,229 --> 00:17:04,869
Speaker 1: drank it One dose left cuz I drank most of that bottle when I was sick, yeah Well today we're gonna tell you what we didn't tell you to get into last week.

224
00:17:05,213 --> 00:17:06,609
Speaker 1: It's how to get into the a-nives.

225
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:19,230
Speaker 1: I've noticed a lot of people who became geek nights listeners because they like the video games or the board games or you know They like the the technology and then they crossed over into the anime from listening to the anime nights.

226
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:33,264
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually in general a lot of people email us constantly saying hey Listen for the one day, but then you got me into something else and I guess that's great because that's what we're really a proponent of.

227
00:17:33,325 --> 00:17:37,334
Speaker 0: Well, I mean we're geeks and Geekery is a really broad thing.

228
00:17:37,374 --> 00:17:46,400
Speaker 0: I mean there's sports geeks and there are athletics geeks and there's everything geek you star geek Yeah, and the fact it's not just video games and anime.

229
00:17:46,661 --> 00:17:51,090
Speaker 0: However for all of you out there who are not anime geeks It's very easy to get into anime.

230
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:58,090
Speaker 1: I think that's why a lot of people have got like a lot of people weren't able to get into Like role-playing or German board game easily.

231
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,539
Speaker 1: So we they really need an episode from us to help out.

232
00:18:00,861 --> 00:18:03,190
Speaker 1: they need to really need it a Linux episode to help out.

233
00:18:03,672 --> 00:18:05,701
Speaker 1: But anime is kind of easy to get into.

234
00:18:05,761 --> 00:18:12,125
Speaker 1: thus we can do this episode quickly and thus Many people who listen to the show have already gotten into it without our specific help.

235
00:18:12,526 --> 00:18:19,090
Speaker 0: now what I wanted to say first And this is before we go into anything else This is kind of important and it's a distinction that really needs to be noted.

236
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:23,330
Speaker 0: A lot of people make the mistake of thinking that anime is somehow a genre.

237
00:18:23,955 --> 00:18:33,163
Speaker 0: Anime is nothing more than a medium So a lot of people who don't know anything about anime Will hear about it and have some sort of opinion based on what they've heard before.

238
00:18:33,183 --> 00:18:39,010
Speaker 1: Oh anime is all that crazy violent Super gory stuff that kids should be watching.

239
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:42,138
Speaker 1: Yeah, all anime is that Japanese cartoon porn?

240
00:18:42,178 --> 00:18:46,870
Speaker 1: or all anime is that cutesy wootsie big eyes small mouth?

241
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,273
Speaker 1: Bullshitty crap.

242
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,142
Speaker 0: Yep, or it's all the seizure robots of the pokemons or whatever.

243
00:18:51,684 --> 00:18:52,245
Speaker 1: Ah, guess what?

244
00:18:52,286 --> 00:18:53,610
Speaker 1: It's all those things and more.

245
00:18:53,962 --> 00:19:06,136
Speaker 0: Yep I mean I actually got a fair number of people back when I worked at IBM into anime and Once I mean, all you have to do is explain to people and as we're explaining to you Don't think of it.

246
00:19:06,196 --> 00:19:08,270
Speaker 0: Like anime is different from any other movie.

247
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:12,370
Speaker 0: It's the same as any movie you've ever seen or any TV show you've ever seen.

248
00:19:12,992 --> 00:19:21,670
Speaker 0: It just happens to have been made in a foreign country and it just happens to be animated Instead of filmed with people and it happens to be originally cast in a foreign language.

249
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:23,455
Speaker 0: Well, I said it was foreign.

250
00:19:23,536 --> 00:19:27,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, but yeah, I mean you this anime that are about science fiction.

251
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,642
Speaker 1: They're anime that are about crazy stupid fighting.

252
00:19:30,682 --> 00:19:31,888
Speaker 0: There's horror anime.

253
00:19:31,928 --> 00:19:40,050
Speaker 1: There's This comedy there's everything and whatever your taste is there is you know, you might not like one anime or another.

254
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:44,402
Speaker 1: But there's probably for every person who enjoys watching video.

255
00:19:44,904 --> 00:19:46,990
Speaker 1: There's probably an anime out there for them.

256
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:52,735
Speaker 0: Yeah, so there are a lot of people who would like to say something like oh, I hate anime I hate all this anime crap.

257
00:19:53,016 --> 00:19:55,566
Speaker 1: That's like saying I hate movies or I hate books.

258
00:19:55,867 --> 00:19:56,208
Speaker 0: I hate.

259
00:19:56,389 --> 00:19:58,979
Speaker 1: yeah There's a book out there you like.

260
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:02,968
Speaker 1: you might really not like complicated books But I'm sure there's like some Star Wars.

261
00:20:03,008 --> 00:20:05,901
Speaker 0: now You'll enjoy and it's nothing and it's not like if you.

262
00:20:05,961 --> 00:20:09,354
Speaker 0: and by the same token if I like anime It doesn't mean like all anime.

263
00:20:10,318 --> 00:20:11,483
Speaker 1: I hate most anime.

264
00:20:11,523 --> 00:20:12,106
Speaker 0: Yeah, me too.

265
00:20:12,387 --> 00:20:13,090
Speaker 0: So did Dave and Joel.

266
00:20:13,231 --> 00:20:14,398
Speaker 0: So anime world order much.

267
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:16,169
Speaker 1: any anime fan hates most anime.

268
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:20,448
Speaker 0: In fact, if anything anime fans probably hate most anime more than non anime fans.

269
00:20:20,689 --> 00:20:28,614
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, probably but say or at least their hate is targeted or known as opposed to a generic, you know, not accurate Hate.

270
00:20:28,716 --> 00:20:29,709
Speaker 1: it's a very real hate.

271
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,148
Speaker 0: Yeah.

272
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:36,870
Speaker 0: So bear that in mind if you have ever thought that you wouldn't like anime for any reason at all.

273
00:20:37,311 --> 00:20:42,286
Speaker 0: That reasons probably BS because there's no unifying characteristic of anime other than that.

274
00:20:42,327 --> 00:20:43,450
Speaker 0: It happens to be animated.

275
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean you might say oh, I hate that cutesy crap.

276
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:48,906
Speaker 1: Well, I also hate most of the cutesy animes.

277
00:20:49,067 --> 00:20:52,463
Speaker 1: not all of them But most of them and you might not like cutesy animes if you don't.

278
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:59,365
Speaker 1: there's plenty of non cutesy anime You just don't know about and haven't experienced and you're just being you know closed-minded and avoiding it.

279
00:20:59,806 --> 00:21:02,153
Speaker 0: now to the other Excuse.

280
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:10,450
Speaker 0: a lot of people like to bring up is they'll say something like well I don't like the culture around anime or I don't like anime fans or I don't like anime conventions.

281
00:21:10,631 --> 00:21:12,339
Speaker 0: I don't like all and something about anime.

282
00:21:12,379 --> 00:21:12,881
Speaker 0: that isn't it.

283
00:21:12,982 --> 00:21:14,770
Speaker 1: Well who says you have to do any of those things?

284
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:21,730
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean most people who watch anime don't go to anime cons don't post in anime forums don't have anime merchandise.

285
00:21:22,432 --> 00:21:28,690
Speaker 0: They watch anime in the same way that people out there watch 24 or American Idol or boondock Saints.

286
00:21:28,951 --> 00:21:31,322
Speaker 1: They just watch Adult Swim and they like it.

287
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:32,910
Speaker 1: and that's that they don't you know.

288
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:37,725
Speaker 1: Maybe they'll buy a DVD now and then or Netflix a series if they miss some episodes on TV.

289
00:21:37,845 --> 00:21:38,648
Speaker 1: Yeah, who knows?

290
00:21:38,829 --> 00:21:45,989
Speaker 0: so don't Decide you're not gonna get into anime Just because you don't like the people who are into anime because those people have nothing to do with you.

291
00:21:46,553 --> 00:21:48,766
Speaker 0: Just watch your movie and don't worry about that.

292
00:21:48,786 --> 00:21:58,636
Speaker 0: Yep So all that aside the biggest problem with getting into anime is that if you ask an anime fan the average man on the street As was evidenced in our forum.

293
00:21:59,138 --> 00:22:00,283
Speaker 0: All right, I'm new to anime.

294
00:22:00,383 --> 00:22:00,845
Speaker 0: I'm game.

295
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:02,010
Speaker 0: What should I watch?

296
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,343
Speaker 1: Well, depending on who you ask you might get a sarcastic answer.

297
00:22:05,363 --> 00:22:13,930
Speaker 1: They might say oh go watch Orochika Doji, which is not something anyone needs to watch or they'll say oh go watch my favorite show.

298
00:22:14,051 --> 00:22:17,190
Speaker 1: My favorite show is Excel Saga and there's some crazy anime fans.

299
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,930
Speaker 1: You don't you're not gonna like their favorite show.

300
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:21,489
Speaker 1: Their favorite show is gonna seem like crazy stupid to you.

301
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:30,190
Speaker 0: Most of the suggestions people give are really kind of bad because while anime is not a genre It's like with movies or anything else.

302
00:22:30,511 --> 00:22:35,570
Speaker 0: There are some movies that can't really be appreciated unless you have a wealth of knowledge of other movies.

303
00:22:35,911 --> 00:22:39,182
Speaker 0: There are some TV shows that really aren't interesting.

304
00:22:39,242 --> 00:22:42,869
Speaker 0: unless you know something about the basis of the TV show You have some investment in it.

305
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:47,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, like Genshiken is a great anime, but you will not understand it unless you are an anime fan.

306
00:22:48,151 --> 00:23:00,008
Speaker 0: Yes, watching Genshiken and not being an anime fan already is like watching a 26 episode Documentary on baseball if you hate baseball or you don't know how the game of baseball is played.

307
00:23:00,189 --> 00:23:02,309
Speaker 1: Yes It just won't work.

308
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:09,595
Speaker 1: So if you're gonna start get into anime sort of the first thing you have to do is figure out Which anime is for you?

309
00:23:09,695 --> 00:23:12,444
Speaker 1: Luckily, there are some anime that are for everybody.

310
00:23:12,464 --> 00:23:12,705
Speaker 1: Yep.

311
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,130
Speaker 0: No, I didn't get into that even.

312
00:23:14,675 --> 00:23:15,909
Speaker 0: Oh, what kind of movies do you like?

313
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:18,256
Speaker 0: What kind of TV shows do you like?

314
00:23:18,658 --> 00:23:19,882
Speaker 0: find anime there to like that.

315
00:23:20,103 --> 00:23:22,070
Speaker 0: if you like action movies get an action anime.

316
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:34,010
Speaker 1: If you like horror find a horror anime, yeah Yeah but anyway There are few and far between anime fans out there like us who will correctly tell you which anime is to watch.

317
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:37,050
Speaker 1: Basically, you can start out there.

318
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:41,010
Speaker 1: There are three places to go for an anime that just about everyone will enjoy.

319
00:23:41,632 --> 00:23:45,763
Speaker 1: The number three place to go is the man we talked about quite often Satoshi.

320
00:23:45,783 --> 00:23:48,270
Speaker 0: Can Satoshi khan is a genius.

321
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:50,749
Speaker 0: Satoshi khan is one of my heroes.

322
00:23:51,372 --> 00:23:57,270
Speaker 1: Yes, Toshi khan is an artistic genius beyond most people currently alive on this planet.

323
00:23:57,651 --> 00:24:02,248
Speaker 1: He is like almost a da Vinci of anime perhaps on the level of Michelangelo.

324
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:13,610
Speaker 0: granted He hasn't done a lot yet But everything he's done is amazing and I really want to see you know Ten years from now when this body of work is more filled out exactly what he's capable of.

325
00:24:13,711 --> 00:24:15,582
Speaker 0: I'm also really looking forward to paprika.

326
00:24:15,683 --> 00:24:16,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're gonna see it this weekend.

327
00:24:17,191 --> 00:24:23,030
Speaker 1: So there's basically, you know, he's made like four movies I think and one TV series.

328
00:24:23,151 --> 00:24:26,130
Speaker 1: But if you're new to anime you want to get into it.

329
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:30,782
Speaker 1: I recommend you watch his movie Tokyo Godfathers before you watch his other movies now.

330
00:24:30,883 --> 00:24:40,489
Speaker 0: granted Tokyo Godfathers is a light-hearted But yet sometimes serious and poignant Comedy slice a lot kind of really slice of life more like adventure.

331
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:53,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, it kind of crosses genre boundaries, but it's generally light-hearted and just enjoyable Yeah, and it's definitely able to be enjoyed, you know, depending no matter which country you're from or what language you speak or anything.

332
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:53,893
Speaker 1: There's not too much.

333
00:24:53,913 --> 00:24:55,178
Speaker 1: There's Japanese in it.

334
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,990
Speaker 1: Yes now by this could be any city on the whole planet.

335
00:24:58,262 --> 00:25:02,870
Speaker 0: Yep Now by the same token another thing that he has done is called perfect blue.

336
00:25:03,513 --> 00:25:15,716
Speaker 0: now if you were into horror if you were into Psychological thrillers if you like Hitchcock movies or Vincent anything scary like that or frightening or disturbing like that Perfect blue.

337
00:25:15,736 --> 00:25:18,932
Speaker 0: It's my favorite Satoshi khan work hands down I don't know.

338
00:25:19,013 --> 00:25:23,306
Speaker 1: I might be able to say that even and though I like Tokyo Godfathers the most.

339
00:25:23,406 --> 00:25:24,590
Speaker 1: but here we go again.

340
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:25,956
Speaker 1: We just said anime fans.

341
00:25:25,977 --> 00:25:27,223
Speaker 1: Just tell you what they like the most.

342
00:25:27,303 --> 00:25:28,730
Speaker 1: and here we are saying what we like the most.

343
00:25:28,876 --> 00:25:31,541
Speaker 0: Yeah I don't want to try to say that what we like is good.

344
00:25:31,581 --> 00:25:34,759
Speaker 0: cuz I'll say I like a lot of things that I'm not Going to bring up in this show.

345
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,853
Speaker 1: Oh, I definitely like a lot of things I'm not gonna.

346
00:25:36,893 --> 00:25:42,473
Speaker 0: you don't want to be watching initial D is your first and oh you do that Not going to be an enjoyable Experience unless you're.

347
00:25:42,753 --> 00:25:50,577
Speaker 1: if you're a guy who really likes all trace cars and car racing and upbeat high-energy music Initial D might be a good anime for you.

348
00:25:50,818 --> 00:26:01,281
Speaker 0: actually if you're not making fun of you if you're a ricer And you're into you know riced up cars and souped up cars and drifting and all like a Honda Civic with a big wing on The back really turns you on.

349
00:26:01,624 --> 00:26:02,289
Speaker 1: go watch initial D.

350
00:26:02,471 --> 00:26:05,107
Speaker 0: You'll become an anime fan in two seconds if you watch initial D.

351
00:26:05,128 --> 00:26:11,094
Speaker 1: in that case I know lots of people like I've run into them all over the place who they're fans of initial D But they're not anime fans.

352
00:26:11,334 --> 00:26:23,730
Speaker 1: They just really like initial D and race cars and all that stuff all right, so yeah, Satoshi khan He makes a lot of great movies and two of his movies perfect blue and Tokyo Godfathers are really good entry points into anime.

353
00:26:24,312 --> 00:26:30,330
Speaker 1: But after Satoshi khan there's another better entry point into anime and specifically TV anime.

354
00:26:30,593 --> 00:26:32,815
Speaker 1: It's the only TV anime We're gonna talk about.

355
00:26:32,835 --> 00:26:39,690
Speaker 1: you see because anime you know this anime movies Which are much easier for people to get into because people already used to movies.

356
00:26:40,091 --> 00:26:42,899
Speaker 1: People are not used to watching a TV series.

357
00:26:42,939 --> 00:26:46,168
Speaker 1: that is 26 half-hour episodes that all have to be watched in order.

358
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:50,049
Speaker 0: now granted This is starting to change very recently in the United States where?

359
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:59,640
Speaker 0: Serial television is coming back and now there's shows like Battlestar Galactica and lost and fire 26 episode beginning middle-end deals.

360
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,070
Speaker 1: they go on after season after season after season you know yeah.

361
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:09,021
Speaker 0: But at the same time there's cereal which is a big step Because there weren't so many serious cereals back in the.

362
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:11,469
Speaker 1: well there were and they went away and now they're coming back.

363
00:27:11,649 --> 00:27:11,930
Speaker 0: exactly.

364
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:24,250
Speaker 0: I'm saying there was this time kind of like co-op gaming where they kind of fell by the wayside And I remember in high school How hard it was to convince any of my friends to ever watch a TV show or an anime because they just they couldn't understand.

365
00:27:24,391 --> 00:27:25,960
Speaker 0: Why would why watch it all at what?

366
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,529
Speaker 0: what they just didn't get it yep?

367
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:44,890
Speaker 1: So because watching a serial TV show like this is sort of alien to Americans and people and most other countries other than Japan And because it's kind of hard to ask someone to start off by watching a show that Really requires you to watch 26 episodes in order.

368
00:27:45,351 --> 00:27:53,811
Speaker 1: There's only one TV show that we recommend that is good as a starting place for an anime viewer and the show is obviously Cowboy Bebop.

369
00:27:54,252 --> 00:28:03,084
Speaker 0: now the best thing about Cowboy Bebop aside from the fact that pretty much everyone likes it Cowboy Bebop is Again, it's a fairly.

370
00:28:03,104 --> 00:28:07,076
Speaker 1: there are people who don't like it, but they are so few and far between it is.

371
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,620
Speaker 1: it is quite crazy.

372
00:28:08,741 --> 00:28:10,890
Speaker 1: It's fair to say that everyone likes Cowboy Bebop.

373
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:12,416
Speaker 0: I showed my dad Cowboy Bebop.

374
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:12,999
Speaker 0: He liked it.

375
00:28:13,682 --> 00:28:16,560
Speaker 0: I showed a co-worker at IBM Cowboy Bebop.

376
00:28:16,981 --> 00:28:34,900
Speaker 0: He ended up watching all of the rest of it and not only did he and this is you know a guy with a family Like a normal not really a geeky guy He loved it to the point that he actually very specifically pointed out to me a lot of scenes that Particularly struck him and they happen to be a lot of the same scenes that particularly struck us.

377
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:39,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, Cowboy Bebop strikes a chord in just about anyone who sees it.

378
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:44,393
Speaker 1: The thing about Cowboy Bebop is that it's sort of the everything show.

379
00:28:44,493 --> 00:28:45,676
Speaker 1: It's got your sci-fi.

380
00:28:45,716 --> 00:28:46,960
Speaker 1: It's got your westerns.

381
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,164
Speaker 1: It's got your action.

382
00:28:48,284 --> 00:28:51,634
Speaker 1: It's got your mysteries your intrigue your drama.

383
00:28:52,036 --> 00:28:53,440
Speaker 1: It's got cuteness.

384
00:28:53,962 --> 00:28:57,480
Speaker 1: It's got everything everything that you could possibly want in a show.

385
00:28:57,841 --> 00:29:07,320
Speaker 1: They somehow put it all in one show, but it works together Correctly and it's not some mixy matchy like patchwork piece of crap.

386
00:29:07,842 --> 00:29:08,103
Speaker 0: It's just.

387
00:29:08,183 --> 00:29:12,820
Speaker 0: it's so beautifully executed and you'll get to the end and the end of Cowboy Bebop.

388
00:29:13,021 --> 00:29:18,725
Speaker 0: it's probably sticks out in the minds of all the people who have seen it as An amazing event.

389
00:29:19,086 --> 00:29:23,320
Speaker 0: I remember feel I didn't know how to feel when I'd seen all of Cowboy Bebop the first time.

390
00:29:23,722 --> 00:29:26,736
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like I saw it coming, but I didn't see it coming.

391
00:29:26,797 --> 00:29:39,607
Speaker 1: and whoa the thing about Cowboy Bebop that makes it also great for entry into anime is that While it is 26 episodes that you should probably watch in order many of the episodes Do not contain the main plot.

392
00:29:39,667 --> 00:29:43,340
Speaker 1: you can just watch them on their own and they're standalone stories.

393
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:46,050
Speaker 1: You know like Batman the animated series a standalone story.

394
00:29:46,532 --> 00:29:55,283
Speaker 1: They're only episodes like five I think 13 14 and 20 and like the last three or four are Actually plot.

395
00:29:55,543 --> 00:30:01,140
Speaker 1: every other episode while there's little tidbits of continuity in them are mostly standalone.

396
00:30:01,823 --> 00:30:05,420
Speaker 1: So if you watch episodes one through four, you know?

397
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:13,919
Speaker 1: Or just episode one you'll get a whole story in just that episode and it feels right and you won't be stuck Having to see more of it to figure out if you like it.

398
00:30:14,105 --> 00:30:21,739
Speaker 0: Yeah Instead thing like it's kind of this idea where each individual part is in and of itself Very enjoyable and you'll feel satisfied seeing just it.

399
00:30:22,242 --> 00:30:25,179
Speaker 0: But the work as a whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

400
00:30:25,561 --> 00:30:30,679
Speaker 0: Yep, also Cowboy Bebop because it moves pretty quickly and it's a lot of action in it.

401
00:30:31,221 --> 00:30:37,256
Speaker 0: It's very accessible to just pick up and watch because the first DVD has five episodes on it.

402
00:30:37,657 --> 00:30:50,455
Speaker 0: those five episodes I practically guarantee Anyone who watches those five episodes will like Cowboy Bebop Before by the time they have watched the fifth episode and will want to see the rest of it.

403
00:30:50,495 --> 00:30:51,820
Speaker 1: and the fifth episode is something special.

404
00:30:52,061 --> 00:31:03,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean the first episode is actually one of the best episodes in the show But not yeah It's not the best episode in terms of being an enjoyable episode as the best action scene at my favorite action scene.

405
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,827
Speaker 0: Actually, there's a couple of really good action scenes.

406
00:31:04,868 --> 00:31:05,068
Speaker 0: Yeah.

407
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:08,140
Speaker 0: Well, we'll talk about Cowboy Bebop someday Yep.

408
00:31:08,501 --> 00:31:14,360
Speaker 1: But the other thing about kaviva the final thing that makes it good as an entry point is that the dub is actually good.

409
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:19,860
Speaker 1: You see if you're not anime fan, you got to realize these things were originally had Japanese voice acting.

410
00:31:20,402 --> 00:31:26,624
Speaker 1: So if you try to watch them, you could watch them with the original Japanese voice acting and subtitles Which nerds prefer.

411
00:31:27,207 --> 00:31:30,640
Speaker 1: and in many cases, it's actually probably a good idea.

412
00:31:30,981 --> 00:31:35,000
Speaker 1: And if you're one of those people who says I don't want to read my show you get used to it.

413
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,045
Speaker 1: Just get over it.

414
00:31:36,105 --> 00:31:39,240
Speaker 0: All right, the voice acting in Cowboy Bebop is perfect.

415
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:56,040
Speaker 0: I mean, it's great in the first five or six episodes like it's already up well and above the best dub ever then and it gets better and better and better and by the end It's there's better voice acting in Cowboy Bebop than I've seen in a lot of actual American live-action movies.

416
00:31:56,269 --> 00:31:56,438
Speaker 1: Yep.

417
00:31:56,943 --> 00:32:02,171
Speaker 1: So even though I say that if you want to get into anime You should probably get used to subtitles.

418
00:32:02,633 --> 00:32:06,000
Speaker 1: if you start off with Cowboy Bebop You don't have to get used to subtitles quite yet.

419
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:16,147
Speaker 1: You can decide if you're into this whole anime thing before you start getting used to subtitles because Cowboy Bebop the English and the Japanese Languages are both awesome.

420
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:19,040
Speaker 1: And in fact, if you speak English is your primary language.

421
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:26,580
Speaker 1: I recommend watching the English language version and not having the subtitles because there are certain episodes where it is superior.

422
00:32:27,324 --> 00:32:39,760
Speaker 0: and if you really like action or Gun drama or gunplay or anything like that or you're trying to get someone else into anime who doesn't really like it Or but they like violent movies or action movies or whatever.

423
00:32:40,241 --> 00:32:49,821
Speaker 0: Or if you don't have time to watch all five episodes of the first DVD of time to watch a movie just watch Episode 5 of Cowboy Bebop Or just episode 1.

424
00:32:49,821 --> 00:32:59,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'd recommend episode 5 because I remember my first experience with Cowboy Bebop was at the RIT anime club Yeah at their first meeting and they did something brilliant.

425
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:15,280
Speaker 0: they showed four different episodes from four different anime to get people into anime and The big one they showed is kind of the climax was episode 5 of Cowboy Bebop And that was the moment when I went from an anime fan to an anime geek that exact moment.

426
00:33:15,401 --> 00:33:24,023
Speaker 1: I think I think what you really have to do is if you're showing Cowboy Bebop to someone to try to get them into anime you have to decide if they're an episode 1 person or an episode 5 Person.

427
00:33:24,205 --> 00:33:28,024
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz something like if someone's already a geek They're probably an episode 5 person.

428
00:33:28,065 --> 00:33:35,343
Speaker 1: if there's someone who likes, you know, like they're intellectual or they like sort of deep meaningful stuff You know, they're.

429
00:33:35,383 --> 00:33:36,687
Speaker 1: they're an episode 5 person.

430
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:39,456
Speaker 1: if they're sort of a Schwarzenegger movie person.

431
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:41,141
Speaker 1: They're an episode 1 I don't know.

432
00:33:41,202 --> 00:33:51,337
Speaker 0: I'd say the other way because episode 1 has an almost utenna-esque level of depth to it But I think that it works on the lower level better than episode 5.

433
00:33:51,337 --> 00:33:51,598
Speaker 1: does?

434
00:33:52,622 --> 00:33:52,903
Speaker 0: I don't know?

435
00:33:52,923 --> 00:33:58,999
Speaker 0: because episode 5 makes up for the lack of action early on with the action scene at the end.

436
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:00,918
Speaker 1: Well, it's up to you.

437
00:34:01,241 --> 00:34:13,139
Speaker 1: I mean that if you're at the point where you're showing Cowboy Bebop to people to you know Them into anime, you know, you've seen one and five and you know, which one is probably gonna work better on that person.

438
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:23,724
Speaker 0: Yes, all right I think I know where you're going with this But I'll let you continue the last thing you if you want to get into anime number one number one above all I'm just gonna come out with it.

439
00:34:24,344 --> 00:34:30,643
Speaker 1: any movie at all that is directed by how Miyazaki any single one pick one It doesn't matter.

440
00:34:31,105 --> 00:34:32,027
Speaker 1: Well, it matters a little.

441
00:34:32,228 --> 00:34:33,715
Speaker 1: you probably don't want to start with pom poco.

442
00:34:33,916 --> 00:34:36,065
Speaker 0: These are very Direct.

443
00:34:36,106 --> 00:34:43,206
Speaker 0: that one great to get into especially if you were trying to get Families or younger children in.

444
00:34:43,266 --> 00:34:50,550
Speaker 0: because on one hand I don't want to say these movies are Disney ask But they are definitely all ages.

445
00:34:50,771 --> 00:34:55,199
Speaker 0: and when I say all ages, I don't mean actually for little kids I mean all ages.

446
00:34:55,367 --> 00:35:10,460
Speaker 1: Yes As in if you are two years old or two hundred years old you will enjoy a how Miyazaki movie Possibly on a different level in fact most likely on a different level But you will enjoy it that you'd have to be inhuman or some evil prick not to enjoy.

447
00:35:11,122 --> 00:35:14,674
Speaker 0: I mean particularly just for someone who's never seen anime at all before.

448
00:35:15,115 --> 00:35:18,244
Speaker 0: I'd probably recommend Spirited away.

449
00:35:18,465 --> 00:35:20,834
Speaker 1: spirit is my favorite one or Mononoke Hime.

450
00:35:21,015 --> 00:35:21,456
Speaker 1: I don't okay.

451
00:35:21,497 --> 00:35:23,768
Speaker 1: He may is also good I I really like.

452
00:35:23,828 --> 00:35:28,098
Speaker 1: moto Rosso is an excellent choice Is an excellent choice.

453
00:35:28,461 --> 00:35:30,708
Speaker 0: Lobbit is a little long, but it is a little long.

454
00:35:30,748 --> 00:35:32,755
Speaker 1: It's a little but the content is good.

455
00:35:32,796 --> 00:35:32,996
Speaker 0: Yes.

456
00:35:33,117 --> 00:35:34,080
Speaker 0: Oh lobs is great.

457
00:35:35,202 --> 00:35:39,738
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah castle not so much, but you know not as much as the other ones, but still great.

458
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:46,756
Speaker 0: Yes I really enjoyed how I was moving pat castle But it wasn't as solid of a screen story as the others that we mentioned are.

459
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:48,060
Speaker 1: the thing that's great about how?

460
00:35:48,280 --> 00:36:06,579
Speaker 1: Miyazaki's movies is not only do they have some sort of universal appeal and not only you know Are they all awesome and can be enjoyed by all ages, but the dubs on them by which Disney has done actually are actually pretty good and tend to have famous people like Billy Crystal is Calcifer and how's moving castle.

461
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:10,360
Speaker 1: and What's that guy Billy Bob?

462
00:36:11,081 --> 00:36:11,424
Speaker 1: Whatever?

463
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:20,807
Speaker 1: yeah, he's in Monodoke Hime I think and the voice acting is really good on them, and you can watch the dub yep, and Even people who like don't aren't get.

464
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:30,516
Speaker 1: you can actually show these two people and not get them into anime like you could just show Them these movies as they would watch a Disney movie like Aladdin or something in fact.

465
00:36:30,536 --> 00:36:31,820
Speaker 1: It won't become an anime fan.

466
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:38,931
Speaker 1: They'll just a joy a wonderful And you know animated full-length motion picture with universal appeal

467
00:36:39,052 --> 00:36:46,900
Speaker 0: if you know someone who first whatever reason hates anime But hasn't really seen a lot and you could probably get away with showing them a Miyazaki movie dubbed

468
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,167
Speaker 1: Without letting you know it's anime.

469
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:48,629
Speaker 0: Don't tell them.

470
00:36:48,669 --> 00:36:50,600
Speaker 0: It's anime until after they've said they liked it.

471
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:56,088
Speaker 1: Just say hey, this is movie Disney put out or something like that yeah, and then at the end You know that was anime right?

472
00:36:56,631 --> 00:37:01,009
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, all right They're also really easy to get like though your best.

473
00:37:01,671 --> 00:37:04,440
Speaker 1: any store that has DVDs will have Miyazaki movies.

474
00:37:04,763 --> 00:37:13,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm pretty sure you can even get him at Walmart probably Alright, so we're not gonna linger long on this because we could do shows and shows and shows about anime as we tend to do.

475
00:37:14,342 --> 00:37:17,080
Speaker 0: But we've already told you how to wet your teeth on anime.

476
00:37:17,621 --> 00:37:18,805
Speaker 0: Where do you go from there?

477
00:37:19,186 --> 00:37:26,451
Speaker 0: aside from the fact that you know pick genres you like in terms of you know action comedy Whatever and then find anime in those genres and just watch them.

478
00:37:27,134 --> 00:37:43,747
Speaker 0: I think like we do with board games I'd like to give you a general just list of in a vague order the big-name shows that That in my mind really stuck out as further cementing my love of anime or in some cases actually Affecting my worldview much like great movies.

479
00:37:43,788 --> 00:37:47,699
Speaker 0: do yeah in general as much as people malign it.

480
00:37:48,682 --> 00:37:52,452
Speaker 0: Neon Genesis Evangelion is a huge anime.

481
00:37:52,934 --> 00:37:58,713
Speaker 0: It's a great anime and just take turns Yeah, all right, so definitely Neon Genesis Evangelion again.

482
00:37:58,773 --> 00:37:59,797
Speaker 0: This is the list of anime.

483
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:03,231
Speaker 0: once you've cut your teeth You've decided you like some anime you want to see more.

484
00:38:03,512 --> 00:38:04,738
Speaker 0: Here's some directions to go in.

485
00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:05,843
Speaker 1: yeah It's plus.

486
00:38:05,923 --> 00:38:11,126
Speaker 1: watching all these different kinds of shows you'll be able to say oh that was a show I didn't like like.

487
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:13,260
Speaker 1: these are like big ones in specific genres.

488
00:38:13,401 --> 00:38:16,494
Speaker 1: Yes, if you like one then you can go deeper into that genre.

489
00:38:16,855 --> 00:38:17,880
Speaker 0: now a lot of shows.

490
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,584
Speaker 0: I just will warn you.

491
00:38:18,604 --> 00:38:28,812
Speaker 0: there's a lot of shows that do things very similar to what Ava did Because Ava to not really spoil things went in a very philosophical Direction and a lot of people say very heavy-handed.

492
00:38:28,972 --> 00:38:32,768
Speaker 0: a lot of people say that was shallow And I don't think it was necessarily shallow.

493
00:38:32,828 --> 00:38:34,715
Speaker 0: It's just that it's so heavy-handed.

494
00:38:34,735 --> 00:38:35,778
Speaker 1: lays it on so thick?

495
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:51,193
Speaker 0: yes Yeah, but suffice to say while some shows may have done what this show did better I think that Ava is a better show overall because a lot of those shows go more heavy-handed or Less heavy-handed and in the end they lose the message

496
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,760
Speaker 1: yep, all right the next show.

497
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,809
Speaker 1: I think that people should at least give a try.

498
00:38:54,869 --> 00:39:00,268
Speaker 1: if you watch Gundam seed the original Gundam seed now It's a good one that Gundam see destiny, which is garbage.

499
00:39:00,529 --> 00:39:02,234
Speaker 0: Yeah garbage all right.

500
00:39:02,314 --> 00:39:10,484
Speaker 1: if you watch Gundam seed all right Just like watch the first few episodes, and if you're liking where it's going you're probably someone who's gonna like Gundam And you know what.

501
00:39:10,504 --> 00:39:12,357
Speaker 1: there's a lot of Gundam out there for you to enjoy.

502
00:39:12,377 --> 00:39:16,235
Speaker 1: yep And it's not hard to go and figure out which other Gundams are really great.

503
00:39:16,497 --> 00:39:20,431
Speaker 0: now even better Say you think the first four episodes of Gundam seed are kind of lame.

504
00:39:20,793 --> 00:39:22,298
Speaker 0: keep watching because it's not like that.

505
00:39:22,338 --> 00:39:24,586
Speaker 0: for the rest Yeah, it's a totally different show.

506
00:39:25,007 --> 00:39:29,000
Speaker 0: It's much more about character relationships and drama that it is the stupid robot.

507
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,369
Speaker 1: I notice a lot of people who are our anime fans.

508
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,915
Speaker 1: They just go blah robots.

509
00:39:32,976 --> 00:39:33,819
Speaker 1: I don't do robots.

510
00:39:33,879 --> 00:39:36,937
Speaker 1: well If you're one of those people who says bye you don't do robots.

511
00:39:36,978 --> 00:39:45,630
Speaker 1: well Gundam seed if you're gonna like if you're gonna like a robot show then that's the one you're gonna like because it's Definitely the least robot II.

512
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:51,145
Speaker 0: you know I realize most of the anime We're about to bring up involve robots But yet here's the thing.

513
00:39:51,165 --> 00:39:54,436
Speaker 0: there are shows that are about the robots and there are shows that have robots.

514
00:39:54,717 --> 00:39:55,620
Speaker 0: don't confuse the two.

515
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,669
Speaker 0: Yes, giant robo is a show about robots.

516
00:39:58,769 --> 00:40:01,237
Speaker 1: Yes, Evangelion really isn't a robot show.

517
00:40:01,297 --> 00:40:03,455
Speaker 0: I would say if anything This is there's a little hit.

518
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:11,680
Speaker 0: Evangelion pretends to be a robot show and then after it's tricked the robot show people into watching it it stops being a robot show.

519
00:40:11,983 --> 00:40:17,112
Speaker 1: Yep, yeah So Gundam seed that'll let you know if you might like robot shows.

520
00:40:17,433 --> 00:40:27,200
Speaker 0: and most even if you don't like the robot show part You'll still like Gundam seed because Gundam seed is an emotional roller coaster that will leave you feeling mentally exhausted by the end.

521
00:40:27,541 --> 00:40:30,071
Speaker 1: It's also sort of soap opera II yes, but it's good.

522
00:40:30,091 --> 00:40:33,322
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would definitely recommend Trigon.

523
00:40:33,502 --> 00:40:34,425
Speaker 1: yeah, try try.

524
00:40:34,445 --> 00:40:36,832
Speaker 0: gun is probably one of my favorite anime ever.

525
00:40:36,872 --> 00:40:37,473
Speaker 0: now try guns.

526
00:40:37,493 --> 00:40:38,216
Speaker 0: a little silly.

527
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:39,780
Speaker 0: it starts out as a comedy.

528
00:40:40,224 --> 00:40:45,599
Speaker 0: It's really kind of wacky and off the wall But it's not wacky and off the wall in the way that a lot of modern anime are.

529
00:40:45,659 --> 00:40:49,725
Speaker 1: yeah It's definitely a post-apocalyptic Liptick sci-fi Western.

530
00:40:49,946 --> 00:41:00,860
Speaker 0: and the thing is it takes a turn for the serious and it gets Really dark and really philosophical and really good and it has great action and great characters and great comedy.

531
00:41:01,742 --> 00:41:17,726
Speaker 0: It it's an anime where I will admit that I be rim and pretty much everyone else in the front row crew Openly cried during yeah, let's see you should probably at some point if you've decided you like anime you should probably watch Akira.

532
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:29,580
Speaker 1: Akira is like the anime movie period and While if you've read the manga the movie loses a lot for you Which is kind of sad because I do think the movie is great.

533
00:41:29,741 --> 00:41:32,380
Speaker 1: But like whenever I watch it, I've read the manga.

534
00:41:32,502 --> 00:41:33,640
Speaker 1: So it's kind of a on me.

535
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,880
Speaker 1: So I always say if you haven't read the manga or watch the movie watch the movie first.

536
00:41:38,382 --> 00:41:43,800
Speaker 1: That way you can actually get the enjoyment from the awesome movie without having it being ruined by the awesomer manga.

537
00:41:43,921 --> 00:41:45,999
Speaker 1: But yep, Akira is sort of like this.

538
00:41:46,822 --> 00:41:47,123
Speaker 1: It's like.

539
00:41:47,384 --> 00:41:55,170
Speaker 1: that's what booted off, you know anime in the US and basically the current, you know That was like the start our generation of anime fan.

540
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:57,640
Speaker 1: That was the Archduke Ferdinand of the current anime.

541
00:41:57,881 --> 00:42:05,160
Speaker 0: Yep, because and not just the current anime but the current anime fans as in people our age Yeah our wave because now there's other waves of anime fans.

542
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:09,760
Speaker 0: There were ways before us but we grew up on the sci-fi network anime and the Akira movie.

543
00:42:09,941 --> 00:42:18,054
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's definitely something everyone should see and whether you like it or not, you know is up to you But it's it's super important and you should.

544
00:42:18,215 --> 00:42:19,160
Speaker 1: it's sort of like Citizen Kane.

545
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,465
Speaker 1: You should watch it whether you like it or not.

546
00:42:20,907 --> 00:42:29,080
Speaker 0: Now one a lot of people like fantasy especially geeks But there's not a lot of great fantasy out there other than in book form.

547
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,026
Speaker 0: There's not a lot of great fantasy movies.

548
00:42:31,046 --> 00:42:33,914
Speaker 0: You could count them on your hands and there's actually.

549
00:42:34,336 --> 00:42:35,740
Speaker 0: well, there's a lot of fantasy anime.

550
00:42:36,242 --> 00:42:37,988
Speaker 0: There's not a lot of good fantasy anime.

551
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:41,120
Speaker 0: now here 12 Kingdom is good, but I haven't seen enough to really say anything.

552
00:42:41,241 --> 00:42:45,454
Speaker 1: it's also kind of hard because well, we define as fantasy is kind of different.

553
00:42:45,494 --> 00:42:51,595
Speaker 1: like there's a lot of Anime that you could call fantasy, you know, because they like you could call bleach fantasy.

554
00:42:51,615 --> 00:42:58,318
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could call antenna fantasy Yeah, but we're talking about high fantasy like wizards and dragons and Knights and that sort of thing.

555
00:42:58,739 --> 00:43:01,144
Speaker 0: now I would say slayers.

556
00:43:01,585 --> 00:43:03,330
Speaker 0: slayers is funny fantasy.

557
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:06,758
Speaker 0: slayers is you know blowing up the in beer and pretzels D&D.

558
00:43:07,601 --> 00:43:09,891
Speaker 0: But it's an anime and it's a great show.

559
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,433
Speaker 0: I love it.

560
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:26,436
Speaker 0: I absolutely love it but if you're looking for, you know straight up semi hardcore fantasy a fairly overlooked show now even though it was Absolutely huge when it was out and it endures to this day and I think it stands up well against a lot of anime that comes out.

561
00:43:26,476 --> 00:43:30,126
Speaker 0: now is Vision of eska flown a mmm.

562
00:43:30,266 --> 00:43:32,572
Speaker 0: That is an amazing fantasy anime.

563
00:43:32,853 --> 00:43:33,034
Speaker 0: Yep.

564
00:43:33,435 --> 00:43:35,300
Speaker 0: It came out back in the Ava days.

565
00:43:35,461 --> 00:43:36,565
Speaker 0: It's been around for a long time.

566
00:43:36,605 --> 00:43:37,107
Speaker 0: It's old.

567
00:43:37,508 --> 00:43:40,480
Speaker 0: you can get the whole thing in a thin pack super cheap at Best Buy.

568
00:43:40,741 --> 00:43:42,126
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like 30 bucks.

569
00:43:42,146 --> 00:43:43,571
Speaker 1: You can have the whole show or something like that.

570
00:43:43,893 --> 00:43:45,760
Speaker 0: I can't recommend this show enough.

571
00:43:46,402 --> 00:43:57,817
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's it's definitely has a lot of things in it that are now cliche and anime like oh transported to another world Obvious romance people with wings, you know transforming robots that sort of thing.

572
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:06,579
Speaker 1: But it's sort of started a lot of those things and it doesn't execute anything in a way that seems cliche Even if it was at the time.

573
00:44:07,481 --> 00:44:07,982
Speaker 1: Let's see.

574
00:44:08,002 --> 00:44:08,423
Speaker 1: I don't know.

575
00:44:08,444 --> 00:44:13,299
Speaker 0: Do you want to keep you think any cuz beyond this if you watch everything that we have just mentioned?

576
00:44:14,102 --> 00:44:15,390
Speaker 1: Probably already anime fan.

577
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:17,080
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah by then you'll have figured out.

578
00:44:18,645 --> 00:44:23,020
Speaker 0: My only real recommendations from this point on is don't bother about this aspect of it.

579
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:36,260
Speaker 0: Well, if you watch the things we mentioned early in the show But if you start watching everything we talked about just now and you start getting into it That is the point where you want to start and this is important pay attention To who did the character designs and who directed?

580
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:42,780
Speaker 0: The shows you liked versus the shows you didn't like and that'll give you a lot of direction in terms of what to watch next.

581
00:44:43,141 --> 00:44:50,968
Speaker 1: Yep, also you can go online and talk to people and listen to podcasts and things and find out you know People who liked X also liked why.

582
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:52,694
Speaker 1: I guess I probably like why.

583
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:54,340
Speaker 1: also, you know, what's similar to this?

584
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:59,520
Speaker 1: What's similar to that and it's not hard once you're into it to figure out which things you will also like.

585
00:45:00,002 --> 00:45:05,360
Speaker 0: And I'm sure a lot of you out there are saying but they didn't say X show or they didn't say such-and-such or whatever.

586
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're gonna say every show in the whole world.

587
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:10,635
Speaker 0: No, we're just giving you a starting point if you need more than what we've given you.

588
00:45:10,695 --> 00:45:19,500
Speaker 1: You're already an anime fan Yeah, and if you're not sure like, you know, if you're not an anime fan You're not sure which kind of or maybe you like watched one that you watch cowboy bebop and you like it.

589
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,545
Speaker 1: But now you don't know where to go.

590
00:45:21,087 --> 00:45:26,138
Speaker 1: come into like our forum or email us or something and say, uh These are the kind of movies I like.

591
00:45:26,862 --> 00:45:34,174
Speaker 1: You know real move like actual live-action movies that you like because everyone has some live-action movies They like and we'll recommend some anime.

592
00:45:34,194 --> 00:45:35,239
Speaker 1: They'll probably like yep.

593
00:45:35,763 --> 00:45:45,488
Speaker 0: And while a lot of our forum members will probably give advice I do note that we because a lot of people seem to be surprised that we do this But we actually post in our own forums.

594
00:45:46,211 --> 00:45:46,873
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

595
00:45:46,893 --> 00:45:47,656
Speaker 0: A lot of people don't.

596

Speaker 0: we're there actively Yeah, so if you ask this sort of question to us in the forums, we will personally answer.

597
00:45:53,937 --> 00:45:56,646
Speaker 0: probably if we notice Yeah, we'll eventually get to it.

598
00:45:56,867 --> 00:45:59,297
Speaker 0: We answer the forums a lot more readily than we answer emails.

599
00:45:59,558 --> 00:46:00,684
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm All right.

600
00:46:00,744 --> 00:46:04,266
Speaker 1: I don't think I want to talk anymore about this because it's getting late Yeah, and I haven't eaten yet.

601
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:06,217
Speaker 1: So you have to eat something go to bed.

602
00:46:06,478 --> 00:46:06,800
Speaker 0: All right.

603
00:46:07,744 --> 00:46:09,280
Speaker 1: But yeah getting into animes not hard.

604
00:46:09,621 --> 00:46:11,688
Speaker 1: Oh and oh, I forgot one two things.

605
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:18,840
Speaker 1: if you're into anime and you've got you finally you decided you like it You're either gonna want to do one or two things or both get Netflix.

606
00:46:19,262 --> 00:46:22,179
Speaker 1: That way you don't have to buy a whole bunch of DVDs just to watch a show.

607
00:46:22,802 --> 00:46:24,549
Speaker 1: You know you buy the shows that you love.

608
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:27,040
Speaker 1: that, you know, you like that you want to watch again and again.

609
00:46:27,582 --> 00:46:31,840
Speaker 1: But if you want to watch it a 26 episode show just once get Netflix.

610
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:38,200
Speaker 1: Also What the new shows that are coming out in Japan right now won't be on DVD for many months.

611
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:43,820
Speaker 1: So you go on the internet and use bit torrent to get those episodes with fansubs on them to figure out which ones you like.

612
00:46:44,221 --> 00:46:49,667
Speaker 1: That way when they do come out on DVD in the US, you know, which ones to Netflix and you know Which one's not to Netflix?

613
00:46:49,908 --> 00:46:50,110
Speaker 0: Yep.

614
00:46:50,211 --> 00:46:51,320
Speaker 0: I mean as much as I love anime.

615
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:57,920
Speaker 0: It's a rare show that will be good enough to get me to watch all the fansubs because I can't wait for the DVDs.

616
00:46:58,381 --> 00:47:00,247
Speaker 0: Currently it's just Claymore and Bocorano.

617
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:01,731
Speaker 1: Yeah, mostly Bocorano.

618
00:47:01,772 --> 00:47:03,437
Speaker 1: I could probably wait for DVDs and Claymore.

619
00:47:03,477 --> 00:47:08,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have a feeling We're gonna wait for DVDs on Claymore because we got a lot going on in the next couple.

620
00:47:08,241 --> 00:47:12,550
Speaker 1: Also, I recognized when I went to Best Buy today I was quite surprised at you know, how quickly.

621
00:47:12,571 --> 00:47:14,500
Speaker 1: they're getting the anime over this side of the ocean.

622
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:18,332
Speaker 0: Yeah, I realized a lot of ergo proxies already on a DVD Haru.

623
00:47:18,372 --> 00:47:20,740
Speaker 1: He was on the shelf and that's a really new show.
