1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,457
Speaker 1: It's Monday, August 13th, 2012.

2
00:00:12,457 --> 00:00:12,978
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:13,860
Speaker 0: I'm Sky.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,303
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,343 --> 00:00:18,750
Speaker 1: Tonight, paying for stuff in the new way.

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,008
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,390
Speaker 0: Yesterday, I go to my friend's wedding who I've known since forever.

8
00:00:30,653 --> 00:00:31,059
Speaker 1: Which guy?

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,345
Speaker 0: You met him once, Rick Cohen?

10
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:34,168
Speaker 0: You met him once.

11
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,900
Speaker 1: I do not remember that as even being a name.

12
00:00:37,644 --> 00:00:39,817
Speaker 0: I think you went to a hockey game once.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,718
Speaker 0: Minor League hockey game.

14
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:46,012
Speaker 1: I vaguely remember that, but I don't remember a person.

15
00:00:46,173 --> 00:00:48,280
Speaker 0: Anyway, I've known him longer than forever anyway.

16
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:54,940
Speaker 0: But it was interesting because I didn't realize, I mean the wedding was in the temple, right?

17
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,312
Speaker 0: It was a, you know, Jewish wedding.

18
00:00:56,332 --> 00:01:02,840
Speaker 0: So you go and you know, it's four o'clock, they do the service, but then all the party was in the same building.

19
00:01:03,443 --> 00:01:06,497
Speaker 0: So it sort of dawned on me like, "Oh shit, this motherfucker's

20
00:01:06,537 --> 00:01:06,879
Speaker 0: kosher.".

21
00:01:09,162 --> 00:01:12,253
Speaker 1: You know, going to Christian-y weddings is the same thing.

22
00:01:12,293 --> 00:01:14,521
Speaker 1: You're like, "All right, the wedding's born, whatever, it'll

23
00:01:14,621 --> 00:01:14,782
Speaker 1: end.".

24
00:01:14,802 --> 00:01:15,746
Speaker 1: And then we go to the reception.

25
00:01:15,766 --> 00:01:21,008
Speaker 1: As soon as you find out the reception's also in the church, that means no booze most of the time.

26
00:01:21,128 --> 00:01:21,710
Speaker 0: Oh, you kidding?

27
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,959
Speaker 0: There's open bars in every room of this place.

28
00:01:24,059 --> 00:01:24,260
Speaker 0: Anyway.

29
00:01:24,401 --> 00:01:25,638
Speaker 0: Oh, that's how the Jews go, I guess.

30
00:01:25,962 --> 00:01:27,519
Speaker 0: Right, but no one tips the bartender.

31
00:01:29,301 --> 00:01:31,212
Speaker 0: There were, I think I had some tips.

32
00:01:31,373 --> 00:01:32,258
Speaker 0: Not everyone was Jewish.

33
00:01:37,206 --> 00:01:39,571
Speaker 0: So, um, what's it called?

34
00:01:39,591 --> 00:01:40,893
Speaker 0: So I'm more, I'm like, "Oh shit, it's

35
00:01:40,953 --> 00:01:41,394
Speaker 0: kosher.".

36
00:01:41,474 --> 00:01:44,460
Speaker 0: And it was, so it was meat and there was no dairy.

37
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,599
Speaker 0: It's like there's a piece of bread on the plate when you go to sit at your table and there's something next to it.

38
00:01:49,061 --> 00:01:49,825
Speaker 0: That ain't butter.

39
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:51,333
Speaker 0: Don't know what it is.

40
00:01:51,354 --> 00:01:52,420
Speaker 0: It's not butter.

41
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,650
Speaker 1: Margarine?

42
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:54,340
Speaker 1: Is margarine kosher?

43
00:01:54,722 --> 00:01:55,025
Speaker 0: I don't know.

44
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:55,814
Speaker 1: I'm gonna find out.

45
00:01:55,854 --> 00:01:56,340
Speaker 1: You keep talking.

46
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:04,480
Speaker 0: In the room, in the cocktail hour room, you go in and hidden in like the corner, there was some, you know, salmon and capers and onions and bagels.

47
00:02:05,062 --> 00:02:05,807
Speaker 0: No cream cheese.

48
00:02:07,116 --> 00:02:07,659
Speaker 0: No cream cheese.

49
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:08,681
Speaker 1: Ah.

50
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,288
Speaker 0: And it's like, "Oh right, no cream

51
00:02:12,328 --> 00:02:12,589
Speaker 0: cheese.".

52
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,360
Speaker 0: So the thing I was, you know, the thing is the food that they did have was excellente.

53
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,990
Speaker 0: There was, there was many very, very tasty foods and also lots of hidden foods.

54
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:21,893
Speaker 0: Like, they had.

55
00:02:21,953 --> 00:02:27,633
Speaker 0: like, you know, it looked like an Ikea cabinet, you know, one of those like bookshelves with just a bunch of squares, like a whole bunch of them.

56
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,140
Speaker 0: Like, you know, five by five squares.

57
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,451
Speaker 0: And they had like fruits on plates inside this thing, just off to the side.

58
00:02:33,471 --> 00:02:34,675
Speaker 0: You wouldn't even know if you didn't look.

59
00:02:34,715 --> 00:02:36,280
Speaker 0: There were so many things to choose from.

60
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,840
Speaker 1: Alright, it's really hard to make margarine kosher because of the, like the practices involved.

61
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:42,400
Speaker 0: Yes.

62
00:02:43,322 --> 00:02:48,593
Speaker 0: Anyway, but the one thing I was worried about the most was the wedding cake.

63
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:52,120
Speaker 0: Because you know wedding cake tastes better than regular cake.

64
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:54,319
Speaker 0: I don't know what the fuck they do with wedding cake.

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,960
Speaker 1: The wedding cake is one, more expensive.

66
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:57,717
Speaker 0: That's true.

67
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,500
Speaker 1: And is not a Betty Crocker cake, which is the majority of cakes you've ever eaten.

68
00:03:03,201 --> 00:03:05,064
Speaker 0: Right, but I mean there's something about wedding cake.

69
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:11,277
Speaker 0: I think all the bakers have this conspiracy of like, "Oh, only make the right, cool, good kind of cake when you're for a wedding.

70
00:03:11,517 --> 00:03:12,640
Speaker 0: Don't make good cake for anyone

71
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:12,760
Speaker 0: else.".

72
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,564
Speaker 1: Wait a minute, Scott.

73
00:03:13,605 --> 00:03:16,500
Speaker 1: The next time we have a normal party, let's get a wedding cake.

74
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,259
Speaker 0: That would be amazing.

75
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:17,918
Speaker 1: Let's do it.

76
00:03:18,362 --> 00:03:19,580
Speaker 0: A one layer wedding cake.

77
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,458
Speaker 0: New Year's wedding cake.

78
00:03:20,964 --> 00:03:21,280
Speaker 1: Perfect.

79
00:03:21,485 --> 00:03:22,079
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

80
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,787
Speaker 0: But, I was like, "Wait a minute.

81
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,777
Speaker 0: This wedding cake's motherfucking

82
00:03:25,858 --> 00:03:26,260
Speaker 0: kosher.".

83
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,386
Speaker 1: Wait, now, why didn't they just not have the meat?

84
00:03:30,486 --> 00:03:39,940
Speaker 1: Because I feel like if you got to give up one side or the other, and it's a party, why not go for the side that lets cake and breads be eaten more readily?

85
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,925
Speaker 0: There was Mad Tasty Meats.

86
00:03:42,025 --> 00:03:44,112
Speaker 0: They brought out this meat on a stick.

87
00:03:44,554 --> 00:03:46,160
Speaker 0: Oh my god, meat on a stick.

88
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:49,904
Speaker 0: I'm not complaining about the food.

89
00:03:49,924 --> 00:03:52,591
Speaker 0: I'm just pointing out these funny "because it was kosher" bits.

90
00:03:52,992 --> 00:03:53,694
Speaker 0: The food was great.

91
00:03:53,754 --> 00:03:54,656
Speaker 0: It was just kosher.

92
00:03:54,676 --> 00:03:55,699
Speaker 0: And as a result...

93
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,218
Speaker 1: We need someone to make that song instead of, "Because I got high, it's because it was

94
00:03:59,258 --> 00:03:59,580
Speaker 1: kosher.".

95
00:03:59,640 --> 00:03:59,840
Speaker 0: Right.

96
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:01,303
Speaker 0: The cake looked pretty good.

97
00:04:01,323 --> 00:04:04,187
Speaker 0: It was a nice cake, ample size.

98
00:04:04,207 --> 00:04:08,433
Speaker 0: I was worried that it wouldn't taste good because it was a kosher wedding cake.

99
00:04:08,914 --> 00:04:09,975
Speaker 0: I was correct to worry.

100
00:04:09,995 --> 00:04:11,538
Speaker 0: It was less good than regular cake.

101
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,207
Speaker 0: Usually when you tell a story, you're like, "I was worried that X...".

102
00:04:17,307 --> 00:04:20,333
Speaker 1: The story is always inevitably, "But luckily it wasn't

103
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:20,634
Speaker 1: X.".

104
00:04:20,673 --> 00:04:22,537
Speaker 1: You just told me, "I was worried he'd

105
00:04:22,557 --> 00:04:22,978
Speaker 1: die."

106
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:24,140
Speaker 1: And then he died.

107
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,511
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was not... I didn't see too many other people eating it.

108
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:29,899
Speaker 0: I think I might have been the only person who even tried to eat it.

109
00:04:31,701 --> 00:04:37,409
Speaker 0: But yeah, it was like really thick frosting that was hard to make the decoration on the outside and it didn't taste good.

110
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,094
Speaker 0: And then the inside of the cake was sort of hard and crumbly.

111
00:04:40,174 --> 00:04:42,057
Speaker 0: It's like, "Yeah, okay.

112
00:04:42,558 --> 00:04:43,719
Speaker 0: Kosher wedding cake, not...".

113
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:44,959
Speaker 1: Not to the best.

114
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:45,540
Speaker 0: No.

115
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:51,329
Speaker 0: So, if you want really good wedding cake, don't buy it from the Jewish baker.

116
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:56,678
Speaker 0: Or at least make sure you get a dairy cake from the Jewish baker.

117
00:04:56,718 --> 00:04:58,120
Speaker 0: Don't get the meat part of cake.

118
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:01,046
Speaker 0: That's all I can say about that.

119
00:05:01,187 --> 00:05:03,178
Speaker 0: No one else really cares about some wedding if someone they don't know.

120
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, but most people don't care about weddings to people they do know.

121
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,802
Speaker 0: That's very true.

122
00:05:08,822 --> 00:05:13,952
Speaker 0: It was actually, you know, I was... You know, whenever you go to a wedding, you're always like hesitant, like, "Is this gonna be

123
00:05:13,992 --> 00:05:14,413
Speaker 0: good?".

124
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:18,140
Speaker 0: I don't know, even though I like these people and, you know, they're all good people.

125
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:33,220
Speaker 1: I've not had that problem because every wedding I've been to since I was a child has been for crew people where I know so many people there that the worst case scenario is I sit in the back and play Puerto Rico with people I know.

126
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:47,019
Speaker 0: One more thing to point out is they had a band instead of a DJ and the band basically played non-stop for the hours they were allotted and then as soon as their time was up, they just started packing up immediately, which, you know, you want to go home.

127
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:47,620
Speaker 0: Can't blame them.

128
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:56,693
Speaker 0: But it's like you sort of realize when you have a DJ, the DJ doesn't have to put forth effort to like put on music like the walk out of the room music.

129
00:05:57,034 --> 00:05:58,396
Speaker 0: So it's like party's over.

130
00:05:58,436 --> 00:06:01,060
Speaker 0: It's just quiet and it's kind of awkward.

131
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:06,330
Speaker 0: And like the caterers are all cleaning up immediately because they want to get their asses out of there, too.

132
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,257
Speaker 0: And, you know, everyone's still standing there because the music just sort of was like, "Oh, we're

133
00:06:09,277 --> 00:06:09,418
Speaker 0: done.".

134
00:06:10,501 --> 00:06:14,739
Speaker 1: You know, when I think back, most of the weddings I've been to, I've been that guy who was there to the end.

135
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,112
Speaker 0: No, I mean, you know, it was only from 4 to

136
00:06:17,112 --> 00:06:18,641
Speaker 0: 10. 4.30,

137
00:06:18,641 --> 00:06:19,418
Speaker 0: you know, everyone's tired.

138
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,120
Speaker 0: No, it was 4 to 10.

139
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,859
Speaker 0: You had to go to bed early.

140
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,960
Speaker 0: Anyway, it was way past my dad's bed.

141
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:24,640
Speaker 0: Marlon.

142
00:06:24,862 --> 00:06:25,580
Speaker 0: Let's get out of here.

143
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:27,219
Speaker 1: Marlon, I'm starting the car.

144
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:27,883
Speaker 0: No, he went.

145
00:06:27,923 --> 00:06:28,950
Speaker 0: He couldn't start the car.

146
00:06:29,191 --> 00:06:30,640
Speaker 0: It was mandatory valet parking.

147
00:06:31,762 --> 00:06:34,358
Speaker 0: So he went outside and was like, "Get in the valet to bring the

148
00:06:34,398 --> 00:06:34,620
Speaker 0: car.".

149
00:06:36,448 --> 00:06:36,596
Speaker 0: Anyway.

150
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:45,160
Speaker 1: So, you know, I'm not going to really dwell on this, but just because it's in the news, Facebook, as you know, not to looking so good.

151
00:06:45,504 --> 00:06:46,237
Speaker 1: Not to looking so good.

152
00:06:46,981 --> 00:06:54,580
Speaker 1: I still stand by my initial, from the very beginning, prediction that the Facebook IPO was little more than a crass cash grab.

153
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:57,640
Speaker 0: By the people who had bought it in the pre-IPO days.

154
00:06:57,941 --> 00:07:06,880
Speaker 1: And by the people who ran the company, just for the sense that every big tech company before that point had been worth, you know, however many millions of dollars.

155
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:10,980
Speaker 1: And then was worth nothing by the time anyone could actually cash out.

156
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,386
Speaker 1: I feel like this is just Facebook saying, "You know what?

157
00:07:13,928 --> 00:07:17,079
Speaker 1: Let's get our money from Wall Street, and then who cares what the fuck happens after

158
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:17,279
Speaker 1: that?".

159
00:07:17,706 --> 00:07:18,299
Speaker 1: It's my guess.

160
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,540
Speaker 1: Just, you know, I'm not affiliated with Facebook, this is not stock advice, blah, blah, blah.

161
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,216
Speaker 0: Strong sell, not stock advice.

162
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:32,800
Speaker 1: I will say that I do not own any Facebook stock, and I have actually considered shorting it, because I think it's going to go way lower.

163
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:33,464
Speaker 0: Do I?

164
00:07:33,645 --> 00:07:33,987
Speaker 0: I don't know.

165
00:07:34,027 --> 00:07:35,013
Speaker 0: I have a 401(k).

166
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:36,120
Speaker 0: that's sort of just this mystery land.

167
00:07:36,241 --> 00:07:39,200
Speaker 1: None of my 401(k) mutual funds have Facebook.

168
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:45,019
Speaker 0: But I mean, I'm not even in, I'm like a layer away, I'm like the Fidelity something something, so I don't even know what fund it is.

169
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,200
Speaker 1: If Facebook drops below like $12, I might consider buying some.

170
00:07:50,902 --> 00:07:51,068
Speaker 0: Buy?

171
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:51,439
Speaker 0: Okay.

172
00:07:53,061 --> 00:08:03,480
Speaker 1: Anyway, so to add insult to injury, there's been all these articles talking about how all the ad clicks are fraudulent, and most of the accounts are fake, and people don't actually use it.

173
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,936
Speaker 1: So one more here.

174
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:12,220
Speaker 1: Apparently, a whole bunch of the high level staff of Facebook quit, possibly because they're rich.

175
00:08:12,963 --> 00:08:13,753
Speaker 0: Oh, good job.

176
00:08:13,914 --> 00:08:14,319
Speaker 0: Way to go.

177
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,680
Speaker 1: They lost four of its highest level managers.

178
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,619
Speaker 0: I salute you for doing what I would do.

179
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,360
Speaker 1: The director of platform partnerships, the platform marketing director.

180
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,857
Speaker 1: What the fuck do any of those jobs fucking do?

181
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,619
Speaker 0: Those are all bullshit jobs that don't do anything.

182
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,180
Speaker 1: I'm the director or vice president of product management.

183
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,414
Speaker 0: I'm the grand vizier of who knows?

184
00:08:32,534 --> 00:08:33,240
Speaker 0: I don't know.

185
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,707
Speaker 1: To be fair, it's the descriptive title.

186
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:35,270
Speaker 1: What do I do?

187
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,780
Speaker 1: I manage the products.

188
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:49,920
Speaker 1: So they've got a platform marketing director, and a director of platform partnerships, and a mobile platform marketing manager, and a design manager.

189
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:55,358
Speaker 1: And all those guys, well, girl, guy, guy, guy quit.

190
00:08:56,743 --> 00:08:56,834
Speaker 0: Okay.

191
00:08:57,702 --> 00:08:59,120
Speaker 1: But that's not my news, because that's boring.

192
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,960
Speaker 1: I just want to kind of kick Facebook while they're down, because I think Facebook has not peaked yet.

193
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:10,360
Speaker 1: But I predict between now and three years from now, the peak of Facebook will happen, and it'll be nothing but decline.

194
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,060
Speaker 0: I always think it's crazy how someone can be growing, but have a decreasing rate of growing.

195
00:09:16,421 --> 00:09:19,000
Speaker 0: And as a result, the market just hammers them.

196
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,016
Speaker 0: It's like, they're fucking growing.

197
00:09:21,097 --> 00:09:21,480
Speaker 0: Come on.

198
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,334
Speaker 0: I mean, not in Facebook's case, but other cases.

199
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,748
Speaker 1: Well, maybe because you don't know those industries that well, and neither do I. We know Facebook.

200
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,480
Speaker 1: We're like, yeah, they're growing.

201
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,370
Speaker 0: But it's like, if I open up a dry cleaner, and in my first year, I get 100 customers.

202
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,075
Speaker 0: In my second year, I got 200 customers.

203
00:09:36,115 --> 00:09:37,117
Speaker 0: In my third year, I got 250 customers.

204
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:45,180
Speaker 0: That dry cleaner's doing real fucking well, even though it didn't gain a hund- you know, its rate of customer increase was half of what it was in the previous year.

205
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:45,601
Speaker 1: Well, it depends.

206
00:09:45,621 --> 00:09:46,363
Speaker 1: What am I looking for?

207
00:09:46,403 --> 00:09:48,769
Speaker 1: Were they spending money on trying to increase?

208
00:09:49,271 --> 00:09:51,055
Speaker 1: Is there a saturation of the market?

209
00:09:51,496 --> 00:09:52,900
Speaker 1: What are the same store sales?

210
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,429
Speaker 1: Are other dry cleaners doing similarly well or poorly?

211
00:09:56,449 --> 00:10:00,300
Speaker 1: There's all these other things, and we don't know them, because we're not businessmen like that.

212
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,825
Speaker 0: I just came up with a crazy idea, though, as I often do.

213
00:10:03,787 --> 00:10:09,920
Speaker 0: Imagine, right, Facebook is still kind of big, the way MySpace, when it died, was still largest.

214
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,919
Speaker 1: I think Facebook is bigger than MySpace ever was.

215
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,883
Speaker 0: Way bigger, right, of course.

216
00:10:13,907 --> 00:10:17,560
Speaker 0: But the stock just completely dies, and they're basically fucked, right?

217
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:29,340
Speaker 0: If the stock goes so low, like pennies or fractions of a penny, we can just buy it all and own Facebook when it's basically dead, the same way that someone bought MySpace when they were dead.

218
00:10:29,643 --> 00:10:31,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, and how's that working out for them?

219
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:31,541
Speaker 0: But think about it.

220
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:35,310
Speaker 0: Millions of people will still go to Facebook.com, and we can just change it to FrontRecruit.com, right?

221
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:37,436
Speaker 0: We just get 51% of those worthless shares.

222
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:48,657
Speaker 1: I just- Facebook's peaking because it doesn't offer what people- you know, people say they want social stuff, like social networking.

223
00:10:48,678 --> 00:10:49,880
Speaker 1: That's like the big thing on the internet.

224
00:10:50,521 --> 00:11:01,660
Speaker 1: But I feel like what Facebook has become is like the stereotype of what people expect from that kind of thing, as opposed to what they actually would do on a regular basis.

225
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:06,236
Speaker 0: Well, no, the real problem with Facebook is that they don't make fucking money, right?

226
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,700
Speaker 1: And G+ is gonna make money?

227
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:18,780
Speaker 0: No, but Google makes money by either- every product Google has either, A, displays ads that actually work, right?

228
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,439
Speaker 1: But the ad market's a big bubble, and it's gonna collapse any day now, too.

229
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:32,620
Speaker 0: Yes, but the Google ads are less bubbly because of their auction mechanic, and B, every other Google product generates data that allows them to improve things.

230
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:39,280
Speaker 1: What about the claims of manipulation by, for example, the thing we were talking about the other day, where I- They give you free money to spend on Google ads?

231
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,869
Speaker 1: Yeah, they gave me $100 to spend on ads, and it's free.

232
00:11:43,049 --> 00:11:47,540
Speaker 1: You know, if I spend that $100 on ads, it doesn't cost them anything except ad time.

233
00:11:47,621 --> 00:11:49,958
Speaker 0: That just shows you how much smarter Google is than everyone else.

234
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,900
Speaker 1: But it pushes up the prices of the ads that I try to buy, because I have all this free money to leverage.

235
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,496
Speaker 0: It sure does.

236
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,869
Speaker 1: But Facebook, I guess you let me finish.

237
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:03,360
Speaker 1: my point, is that think about what it really means to be social.

238
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:10,578
Speaker 1: It's talking to your friends, exchanging information in a useful sense, and Facebook became the thing of friend.

239
00:12:10,618 --> 00:12:19,580
Speaker 1: everybody you know, so now it's very hard to do the things that people actually do in the real world, like invite these four guys to their party but not those other two guys.

240
00:12:19,641 --> 00:12:20,338
Speaker 0: Facebook does that.

241
00:12:20,885 --> 00:12:21,540
Speaker 1: Not as easily.

242
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,660
Speaker 0: It does it real easily.

243
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:27,551
Speaker 1: Look at how the drama that most people have with Facebook and the way they use it.

244
00:12:28,474 --> 00:12:30,480
Speaker 1: The information leakage is inevitable.

245
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,360
Speaker 0: No one really has this kind of drama.

246
00:12:33,321 --> 00:12:33,939
Speaker 0: You don't know normal people.

247
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,419
Speaker 0: You don't even have a Facebook account.

248
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:43,880
Speaker 0: You realize that you can be like, hey, event, invite, and you start typing people and it autocompletes all their names and you click okay, and then it invites those people.

249
00:12:44,702 --> 00:12:47,520
Speaker 0: And you can say these people are family, these people are these.

250
00:12:48,442 --> 00:12:51,020
Speaker 0: It's just like circles only with a crappier UI to organize the people.

251
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, so here's what happens.

252
00:12:52,080 --> 00:13:02,000
Speaker 1: People do that, they make the event, and then they post the photo from the event, and they don't direct it at those same specific people.

253
00:13:02,422 --> 00:13:04,793
Speaker 1: And then Joey Jojo says, hey, how come?

254
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,260
Speaker 1: we had a party and I was invited?

255
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,279
Speaker 1: And the drama happens.

256
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,540
Speaker 0: Well, if you have that situation, you have drama anyway.

257
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,259
Speaker 0: No software is going to help you with that.

258
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:16,320
Speaker 0: Well, to be fair-- If you're all using Google+, you still would have had the same problem.

259
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:20,240
Speaker 1: No, because you say all the pictures from the thing, you put in the same set of circles much more easily.

260
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:26,960
Speaker 0: No, because if you were--on Google+, you have to consciously say post this picture to these circles.

261
00:13:27,061 --> 00:13:28,420
Speaker 0: On Facebook, you could do the same damn thing.

262
00:13:28,521 --> 00:13:32,020
Speaker 1: Or you reply to the original invite as a comment and it's the same people.

263
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,951
Speaker 0: You could do the same thing on Facebook also.

264
00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:35,540
Speaker 0: You just have to be--it's up to you to do it.

265
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, Google makes it easier.

266
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:40,460
Speaker 0: The only thing Google makes easier is the interface of organizing the people.

267
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,900
Speaker 0: That is the only real difference.

268
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,760
Speaker 1: You seem to overestimate the average abilities of the average user.

269
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,940
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, if they can't do it on Facebook, you can't do it on Google+ either.

270
00:13:49,100 --> 00:14:05,219
Speaker 1: But there have been a bunch of articles talking about the place that Google is starting to surprisingly get market share either parallel to Facebook, or not really replacing Facebook, but being used despite Facebook is the fact that everyone has a Gmail account, so everyone by default has this sort of--.

271
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,100
Speaker 0: That's what they tried to do with their Google Buzz originally.

272
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:16,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, so but what happens is you're sitting there and you want to like, "Hey, I should talk to these three friends," and you just kind of click on them in Gmail and suddenly you got a video chat going.

273
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,929
Speaker 0: The Hangout has definitely helped Google+ a lot.

274
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:23,520
Speaker 0: Facebook really should have had something like that a long time ago.

275
00:14:24,182 --> 00:14:25,707
Speaker 0: I don't know why they never have bothered.

276
00:14:25,727 --> 00:14:29,520
Speaker 0: They maybe could have bought Skype instead of letting Microsoft buy it, you know.

277
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,049
Speaker 0: But then again, there is a Microsoft-Facebook connection.

278
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:35,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's the one place Facebook is really missing out.

279
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,291
Speaker 1: Well, Facebook also had the business model of be super spammy.

280
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:40,840
Speaker 1: Look at how much it killed Zynga when they cut back on that spam.

281
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,142
Speaker 0: Well, that wasn't Facebook's business model.

282
00:14:42,162 --> 00:14:51,400
Speaker 0: That was people building on Facebook found value in being on Facebook because being super spammy allowed them to get stuff to be really popular.

283
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:57,500
Speaker 1: But without that thriving marketplace of spammy people, it cut down on Facebook's value proposition from the business side.

284
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,464
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's really easy now on Facebook.

285
00:14:59,785 --> 00:15:02,711
Speaker 0: There are some people that we know that play stupid Facebook games.

286
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:06,739
Speaker 0: So once a week, I'll see something like-- I'm not going to name any names.

287
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:07,160
Speaker 0: You know who you are.

288
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,440
Speaker 1: You should name some names because those people should know better.

289
00:15:10,642 --> 00:15:20,800
Speaker 0: Jason Hawk, Laura, Bruce, Jared Sorenson playing Marvel Avengers Alliance.

290
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:21,581
Speaker 1: What?

291
00:15:21,722 --> 00:15:22,807
Speaker 1: Jared, you know better.

292
00:15:22,847 --> 00:15:24,052
Speaker 1: You make games.

293
00:15:24,072 --> 00:15:25,720
Speaker 1: Maybe he's doing market research.

294
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,340
Speaker 0: You know, relatives of mine playing Slingo this or Bejeweled that.

295
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:31,514
Speaker 1: No Facebook account.

296
00:15:32,722 --> 00:15:39,655
Speaker 0: So anyway, they'll play some stupid game and they'll be noticed like so-and-so is invited you to What's-a-ville, right?

297
00:15:39,715 --> 00:15:40,537
Speaker 0: And it's never Farmville.

298
00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:42,280
Speaker 0: It's always something else at the castle or something.

299
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:47,009
Speaker 0: And then you just click on this little arrow and you say-- you don't say block the person.

300
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:50,637
Speaker 0: You say block the fuck out of Marvel Avengers whatnot.

301
00:15:50,677 --> 00:15:52,020
Speaker 0: And then you just never see that shit again.

302
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that kills a lot of the value proposition of Facebook.

303
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,200
Speaker 0: Well, if you are Marvel's stupid social game, yeah.

304
00:15:59,461 --> 00:16:03,820
Speaker 1: And those things-- I mean, look, didn't Facebook buy a bunch of Zynga, have a very tied interest?

305
00:16:04,062 --> 00:16:04,372
Speaker 0: I don't know.

306
00:16:05,945 --> 00:16:06,779
Speaker 1: Anyway, you got news?

307
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:12,493
Speaker 0: I don't have a news, but I want to geek back something because I've actually been reading a lot less internet.

308
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:15,160
Speaker 0: The only internet I read now, I cut out Reddit and Hacker News.

309
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,257
Speaker 0: I'm only reading Twitter, Google News, Forum, Gmail.

310
00:16:20,277 --> 00:16:21,160
Speaker 0: That's pretty much it now.

311
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:21,461
Speaker 1: Really?

312
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:24,540
Speaker 1: So I love how Twitter is on that list.

313
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,086
Speaker 0: That's right.

314
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,260
Speaker 0: I'm reading my tweets.

315
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:35,000
Speaker 1: I've actually been using Twitter a lot more than I used to lately, which is odd because we originally thought Twitter was stupid and used LaConica instead.

316
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,244
Speaker 0: Well, I didn't think that Twitter was stupid.

317
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:45,020
Speaker 0: I thought that the federated model-- and I still believe that the federated model is the correct model for pretty much all cloud services.

318
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,801
Speaker 0: It's just that.

319
00:16:46,563 --> 00:16:52,877
Speaker 0: for some reason, if you look at history of internets, the cloud model-- the federated cloud model always wins.

320
00:16:52,918 --> 00:16:53,980
Speaker 0: It just takes for fucking ever.

321
00:16:54,262 --> 00:16:55,695
Speaker 0: How long did it take for Jabber to win?

322
00:16:55,756 --> 00:16:56,220
Speaker 0: A decade?

323
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,639
Speaker 1: It only won because Google used it.

324
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,680
Speaker 0: No, but it's federated between Google and AOL.

325
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,565
Speaker 1: Oh, I know, I know.

326
00:17:03,786 --> 00:17:06,460
Speaker 1: But it only even worked because Google owned it and forced it.

327
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,579
Speaker 0: But the fact that it was federated helped it work.

328
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:15,980
Speaker 1: Ah, but Twitter itself being federated would only hurt Twitter's monetization model.

329
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:16,501
Speaker 0: Of course.

330
00:17:17,082 --> 00:17:26,920
Speaker 0: But if another federated Twitter-alike was around, sort of like AIM was around and Google Talk was around, Google Talk was federated and AIM wasn't.

331
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:33,020
Speaker 0: And then eventually, okay, they both get the federated going on and then, boom, everyone's federated.

332
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:33,999
Speaker 1: But you need critical mass.

333
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,264
Speaker 0: Of course you need critical mass.

334
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:39,260
Speaker 0: That's why I say it takes forever, but it seems to eventually win most of the time.

335
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:41,251
Speaker 1: Of course, LaConica died.

336
00:17:41,271 --> 00:17:42,860
Speaker 0: It turned into StatusNet.

337
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,410
Speaker 0: LaConica's problem was not its federatedness.

338
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:47,720
Speaker 0: Its problem was the actual software.

339
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,459
Speaker 0: They had a goal of making it easy to install, like WordPress.

340
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,280
Speaker 0: And if they actually had achieved that goal, it would have actually probably, I think, been extremely successful.

341
00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:00,340
Speaker 0: Their problem was is that setting that shit up, it was so broken and hacky and crashy and it was awful.

342
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,877
Speaker 0: It probably still is a piece of shit.

343
00:18:01,938 --> 00:18:02,120
Speaker 0: Anyway.

344
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,220
Speaker 1: We ran an official FRC LaConica server for a while.

345
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:05,581
Speaker 1: We did.

346
00:18:05,621 --> 00:18:13,180
Speaker 0: If someone wrote a federated microblogging service or whatever you want to call it, I would definitely run it if it didn't suck like LaConica, Identica does.

347
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,180
Speaker 0: Well, now it's StatusNet.

348
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:15,923
Speaker 0: Sure, whatever.

349
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:17,819
Speaker 0: I could even write one if I wanted to.

350
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:25,180
Speaker 0: Anyway, right, so I started using, man, we're going all the way, huge tangent there.

351
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,420
Speaker 0: I started using the Amazon Cloud Music Play thingy, just like you're using the Google one, right?

352
00:18:30,683 --> 00:18:31,699
Speaker 1: I've used the Amazon one, too.

353
00:18:32,021 --> 00:18:32,403
Speaker 0: Oh, have you?

354
00:18:32,424 --> 00:18:32,726
Speaker 0: Okay.

355
00:18:32,948 --> 00:18:34,560
Speaker 0: So the Amazon one came out with this thing.

356
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:43,307
Speaker 0: You pay, I love annual pricing, 25 bucks a year gets you a ridiculous amount of storage space and 250,000 songs, right?

357
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,680
Speaker 1: Now that's double what I pay for Flickr.

358
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,954
Speaker 0: I only have like 7,000 songs, so this is awesome.

359
00:18:52,061 --> 00:18:53,319
Speaker 0: I don't know how many songs I have.

360
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:58,280
Speaker 0: That storage space actually only counts for the Amazon Cloud Drive.

361
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:06,420
Speaker 0: So if you upload, say, a song, a legitimate song that's like 10 megabytes, that just counts as a song, even if you upload it, right?

362
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:18,800
Speaker 0: We're not talking about, you know, and it will match songs, so if it sees a song you have and it matches a song in the Amazon MP3 library, they just give you a 256 kilobit version of that song, unless yours is better, and then you don't actually upload.

363
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,960
Speaker 1: I was about to say, unless yours is better is very important.

364
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:29,880
Speaker 0: Right, and you don't have to actually upload yours, they just give you one, but that only counts as a song, even if you're uploading.

365
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:34,220
Speaker 0: It only counts as one song, it counts as zero bits in the storage space.

366
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:39,820
Speaker 1: So what if I upload a 10 million hour Stag in a Graphic WAV file?

367
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,040
Speaker 0: They don't actually allow uploading in WAV files.

368
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:42,797
Speaker 1: Alright, MP3.

369
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:43,619
Speaker 0: They allow that.

370
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,028
Speaker 1: Alright, so I upload a 100 terabyte MP3 file.

371
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,499
Speaker 0: It has to actually be a song.

372
00:19:48,206 --> 00:19:48,719
Speaker 1: It's a song.

373
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,040
Speaker 0: The importer thing sort of detects whether it's a song.

374
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,258
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what, so it has an MP3 header?

375
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,897
Speaker 0: It'll probably let it through, but it was actually pretty intelligent in terms of saying, "Oh shit, that's a podcast, that's a song, that's a podcast, that's a

376
00:19:59,938 --> 00:20:00,179
Speaker 0: song.".

377
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:00,555
Speaker 0: It knew.

378
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:03,160
Speaker 1: Oh, so it doesn't let you upload podcasts?

379
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,856
Speaker 0: I mean, it did accidentally upload a bunch of podcasts, because it's not that smart, but another time it actually said, "Oh, those are

380
00:20:09,896 --> 00:20:10,360
Speaker 0: podcasts.".

381
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:16,760
Speaker 0: I think the difference was, is when I uploaded just a folder of MP3s by saying browse, check this folder out, it uploaded podcasts.

382
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:21,610
Speaker 0: But when I said, "Hey, look through my iTunes library and upload that shit," then it recognized what-.

383
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:23,600
Speaker 1: Ah, that makes sense.

384
00:20:25,566 --> 00:20:29,040
Speaker 0: So I'm using this thing, and it's got a lot of good stuff to it, right?

385
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,458
Speaker 0: So the good stuff is, number one, there's three components.

386
00:20:33,741 --> 00:20:36,860
Speaker 0: There's the downloader, the uploader, the importer, and the player.

387
00:20:37,641 --> 00:20:39,920
Speaker 0: So the downloader has always been amazing.

388
00:20:40,564 --> 00:20:42,120
Speaker 0: You couldn't really improve the downloader.

389
00:20:42,564 --> 00:20:43,140
Speaker 0: It's amazing.

390
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,140
Speaker 0: It's the same one that you use if you buy music on Amazon, right, legitimately.

391
00:20:47,902 --> 00:20:59,200
Speaker 0: It opens up this little program, downloads the MP3s from Amazon really quickly, and then automatically inserts them into your iTunes or Windows Media Player, or whatever it is that you use, with all the exact metadata, and it's awesome.

392
00:20:59,621 --> 00:21:06,180
Speaker 0: And the thing is, with this, you could upload things into your cloud player, and then download them with the same downloader.

393
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:12,360
Speaker 0: So you can go to another computer, get the Amazon downloader, and download your own stuff that you just uploaded.

394
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,940
Speaker 1: See, that's the thing I can't do, because I use Spotify a lot right now, and I pay for the premium Spotify.

395
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,140
Speaker 0: I stopped paying for Spotify, but I still use the free Spotify for stuff that's on Spotify.

396
00:21:21,341 --> 00:21:25,160
Speaker 1: I pay for it because I use the playlist generation for road trips and things.

397
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,002
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

398
00:21:26,062 --> 00:21:30,280
Speaker 0: Anyway, so the cloud player is not the best.

399
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,000
Speaker 0: It does a very good job of, here's all your music.

400
00:21:33,141 --> 00:21:38,900
Speaker 0: You can access it on your phone or your computer, and stream it just perfectly, or download it, or whatever.

401
00:21:39,743 --> 00:21:40,980
Speaker 0: And in that respect, it is great.

402
00:21:41,322 --> 00:21:45,420
Speaker 0: And you can search your music, and you can organize playlists, and in that respect, it's great.

403
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:50,940
Speaker 0: The problem is, it doesn't really let you edit metadata or organize, other than making playlists.

404
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,240
Speaker 0: So you basically have this gigantic list of all the songs.

405
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,519
Speaker 1: Not even by album.

406
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,360
Speaker 0: You can sort by album, kinda.

407
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,799
Speaker 0: You gotta search, really, is your only resort, mostly.

408
00:22:01,181 --> 00:22:09,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's where Spotify- I mean, you can click the album button, and you'll get this screen full of a million squares with album covers, most of which are not actually album covers, just like Amazon logos.

409
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:14,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, honestly, Google Play, that kind of whole thing, I only use Google Listen for podcasts.

410
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,119
Speaker 0: Google Listen's dying, I heard.

411
00:22:16,721 --> 00:22:18,798
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was being pulled into- They're closing it out.

412
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:19,340
Speaker 1: Yeah.

413
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:25,200
Speaker 0: Anyway, and the third part is the importer, which is how you take music you have and put it into the thing, right?

414
00:22:25,642 --> 00:22:26,900
Speaker 0: So, it's good and bad.

415
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:31,480
Speaker 0: It's good in that you can point it at your music, and it uploads it relatively quickly.

416
00:22:31,581 --> 00:22:33,780
Speaker 0: It's bad because it's kinda glitchy and buggy.

417
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:41,040
Speaker 0: Like, I told it to upload a folder of stuff, and, like, for example, it's trying to upload the Matt Cross Complete soundtrack, right?

418
00:22:41,601 --> 00:22:48,419
Speaker 0: Only three of those songs have English titles, the rest have Unicode Japanese titles, and it uploaded just those three songs, it ignored the rest.

419
00:22:49,226 --> 00:22:49,311
Speaker 1: Ugh.

420
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,351
Speaker 0: And I was like,

421
00:22:50,515 --> 00:22:50,699
Speaker 0: "What?".

422
00:22:50,881 --> 00:22:53,040
Speaker 0: And I emailed them, and I guess they're working on it, right?

423
00:22:53,500 --> 00:23:05,920
Speaker 0: Another time, like, I uploaded one folder, and it slowly but assuredly uploaded the whole folder, and then I uploaded this other folder, and it sort of got in an infinite loop of, you know, checking up, checking the files without ever actually uploading anything, and it did that overnight.

424
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,552
Speaker 0: And I'm like, "Whoa, okay,

425
00:23:07,612 --> 00:23:07,935
Speaker 0: whatever.".

426
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:12,700
Speaker 0: But then, that was just telling it, you know, to browse for a folder.

427
00:23:13,281 --> 00:23:15,460
Speaker 0: I started a thing where I said, "Look at my iTunes,".

428
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:21,818
Speaker 0: because what it is is I just dragged all my music into iTunes, and then I said, "Amazon importer, look at iTunes and upload everything you

429
00:23:21,878 --> 00:23:22,059
Speaker 0: see.".

430
00:23:22,662 --> 00:23:28,100
Speaker 0: And that seemed to work relatively well, and was actually seeing more of the non-English music.

431
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,559
Speaker 0: So I recommend using that mode.

432
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:39,639
Speaker 0: But yeah, as for how it compares to the Google or the iTunes match, or any of those things, I'm not too sure, because I haven't really used those that much.

433
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:56,140
Speaker 0: But the price is right, you know, 25 bucks a year, that's not too bad, especially since it's, you know, in terms of the number of songs, 250,000 songs, and then you get like 50 gigs, like a lot of gigs of just storage space.

434
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,619
Speaker 0: that is not, the songs don't count against that, that's pretty great.

435
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:11,699
Speaker 0: So I recommend trying out the free versions of all three, the Apple One, iCloud, Google Music, and Amazon Music, to figure out which one you like the most, and then pick one.

436
00:24:12,082 --> 00:24:21,410
Speaker 1: And of them, honestly, I still just use Spotify, because the metadata is super good in Spotify, and that is the main thing.

437
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:31,299
Speaker 1: I use that music service for now, because I don't listen to music idly, like I never listen to music in the background, I listen to music as an activity in and of itself.

438
00:24:32,281 --> 00:24:36,699
Speaker 1: Or driving, I will listen to it in the background, that's the only time, and I don't drive that often anymore.

439
00:24:37,623 --> 00:24:45,840
Speaker 1: Like in the subway, I'm not going to listen to music, I'll listen to words, or read, or wear earplugs or something, because if I'm not giving it my whole attention, it feels like it's a waste.

440
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,078
Speaker 1: But that's me.

441
00:24:47,661 --> 00:24:51,440
Speaker 0: I'm with you, I mostly listen to music with a mostly full attention.

442
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,539
Speaker 0: Like, I might have music on while doing dishes, and you might say, "Oh, that's background music,".

443
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,620
Speaker 0: but actually, the dishes are the secondary activity, not the music.

444
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,132
Speaker 0: So yeah.

445
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,980
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day!

446
00:25:10,723 --> 00:25:12,000
Speaker 1: So, Homestuck.

447
00:25:12,902 --> 00:25:16,420
Speaker 0: Oh boy, woah woah, are you sure you want to talk about this on Monday?

448
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,799
Speaker 0: So, Homestuck is the thing- You sure you want to talk about this at all?

449
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:20,920
Speaker 1: On the internet.

450
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:21,430
Speaker 0: Yeah.

451
00:25:22,448 --> 00:25:23,079
Speaker 0: You could say that.

452
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:37,339
Speaker 1: It is either drivel, or it is the first thing that Scott and I are officially too old to understand, the kids who are into Homestuck are to us what we were to the people older than us.

453
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,019
Speaker 0: You forgot possibility number three.

454
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,980
Speaker 1: That the person who made it is crazy?

455
00:25:41,285 --> 00:25:42,200
Speaker 0: No, all of the above.

456
00:25:43,885 --> 00:25:45,180
Speaker 1: I don't like Homestuck.

457
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:55,198
Speaker 1: I tried to read it, I read thousands of these panels, and it actually would have been okay were it not for the fact that for almost all these panels, there's all this text.

458
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:01,300
Speaker 1: And the text reads like that crazy guy who lectured at Open Everything many years ago.

459
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:04,480
Speaker 0: The only thing that I don't like about it- What the fuck was that guy's name?

460
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,459
Speaker 0: Is that it's incomprehensible.

461
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:22,100
Speaker 0: You look at it, it's just a whole pile of gobbledygook, and it would take so much, it hurts literally my eyes and brain to try to look at it and figure it out, like neon colored text in a white background, and it's not even English, it's like, "Hargoblarga doobadoo," and I'm like, I can't even bother to, I can't go through with it.

462
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:37,420
Speaker 1: The strips themselves are fairly artistic, and that's an only story as far as I can tell, but those words read like something that came out of the mind of a disturbed, it's like lost without the cognitive levels that you get from one.

463
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,760
Speaker 0: I didn't interview the Homestuck guy.

464
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,840
Speaker 1: See, I start to ramble and just kind of go off into nowhere.

465
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,699
Speaker 0: All right, so anyway, why is this your thing of the day?

466
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:57,040
Speaker 1: So someone made a video that is just the first three years worth of Homestuck panels, none of these words that go off into gibberish no man's land, in a movie.

467
00:26:58,161 --> 00:27:17,620
Speaker 1: And it's actually, in my opinion, pretty good in and of itself because it's interesting, and it gives you these sort of vignettes, or you'll see disturbing images or things or love stories, but you can't quite interpret them, so it gives the same experience as someone like me trying to read Homestuck without having to read that bullshit.

468
00:27:17,960 --> 00:28:02,955
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can sort of now tell, I watched this video, and I obviously can't tell you the plot of Homestuck, but I could sort of figure out, like, okay, now that it's going by really quickly, and I just see pictures, obviously I don't know any details, but I can see that these different kids, mostly this kid, but also other kids, and they're sort of communicating with each other over some internets, and some of them are in dark places, some of them are in light places, and some of them are doing things, and weird computer game-like things are happening to all of them, and at some point the candy corn horn trolls appear that I see cosplaying at all the conventions, and there's sort of battles occurring, so there's some sort of space battle with these trolls, and these kids are involved who only talk to each other on the internet, and at least don't meet up.

469
00:28:03,336 --> 00:28:09,040
Speaker 0: within this video, at least not any panel I could see, and that's sort of what's going on.

470
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:16,284
Speaker 1: This gives you these sort of, like, emotional flashes of what Homestuck could really be about, and it seems cool.

471
00:28:16,344 --> 00:28:25,399
Speaker 1: The thing is, this reminds me of when I saw a music video to the Utena movie many years ago, or to a Shematic Princess to anime many years ago.

472
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,099
Speaker 0: Shematic Princess, whoa, I remember that video!

473
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,220
Speaker 0: Let's do a Wednesday in Shematic Princess, go get the disc.

474
00:28:32,643 --> 00:28:33,719
Speaker 1: I watched it a few years ago.

475
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,657
Speaker 0: I've never watched it.

476
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:35,689
Speaker 0: Really?

477
00:28:35,709 --> 00:28:36,560
Speaker 1: It's actually not that bad.

478
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,799
Speaker 0: Everyone had it lying on the floor, and I was like, nope.

479
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:53,979
Speaker 1: Shematic Princess and the Utena movie, I watched these music videos, and I was like, if these music videos are any indication of what these movies are like, or OAV in the case of Shematic Princess, this is going to be the best thing ever, and then I watched the things the music videos were based on,

480
00:28:55,046 --> 00:28:55,292
Speaker 0: not

481
00:28:55,374 --> 00:28:55,600
Speaker 1: Monika.

482
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,540
Speaker 1: Should have just watched the music video.

483
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,759
Speaker 0: Not Monika levels.

484
00:28:59,702 --> 00:29:01,600
Speaker 1: So, this does that to Homestuck.

485
00:29:02,581 --> 00:29:09,760
Speaker 1: The reason I make it the thing of the day is that everyone should watch it, because you will know enough about Homestuck to not need to know more.

486
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,420
Speaker 0: It's only five minutes of your life, right?

487
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:18,700
Speaker 0: It's not like, you know, the amount of time it takes is a worthwhile investment for this thing that is so ridiculously popular.

488
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:24,560
Speaker 1: Now, you say it's so ridiculously popular, and there is a perception.

489
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:34,720
Speaker 1: I was talking to someone like six or seven months ago, and they said something to the effect of, you go on and on about how popular My Little Pony is, or Venture Brothers is, or all these things.

490
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,871
Speaker 1: Homestuck is just as popular.

491
00:29:36,992 --> 00:29:38,180
Speaker 1: Nobody talks about that.

492
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:44,750
Speaker 1: So, I did a little bit of internet forensics, because this video, as great as it is, and it was uploaded in May, doesn't even have 10,000 views.

493
00:29:45,881 --> 00:29:46,893
Speaker 0: Well, why would this video have 10,000 views?

494
00:29:47,722 --> 00:29:49,380
Speaker 0: Homestuck people are on Tumblr.

495
00:29:50,683 --> 00:29:53,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, Tumblr, it's the same people in a circle, jerk.

496
00:29:53,900 --> 00:30:00,580
Speaker 1: I went around, and there are fan works related to Homestuck, and fan stuff related to Homestuck.

497
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,096
Speaker 0: Tons of it.

498
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:21,760
Speaker 1: But I did things where I'd Google for a certain Homestuck something mashup, and then Pony something mashup, Venture Brothers something mashup, and I feel like Homestuck, while popular, is not nearly as popular as it is easy to think it is if you are someone who uses Tumblr and goes to conventions.

499
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,160
Speaker 0: I think it's just the traffic to the Homestuck site is off the charts, right?

500
00:30:29,243 --> 00:30:30,247
Speaker 1: What numbers do you have?

501
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:33,440
Speaker 1: We don't have the third-party analytic measures.

502
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,039
Speaker 0: I've read articles about how big the traffic is.

503
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, but compare it to Penny Arcade.

504
00:30:38,365 --> 00:30:39,540
Speaker 0: I don't know how it is compared to Penny Arcade.

505
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,660
Speaker 1: Or, I don't know, Johnny Wander even.

506
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,037
Speaker 0: I think it's bigger than that.

507
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:55,200
Speaker 0: But it's basically, you just have this tremendous number of people just mostly hammering this site, and then, you know, it doesn't, it has a lot of, it's very sort of like this insular thing.

508
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:58,680
Speaker 0: Like, you know, everyone talks about like Harry Potter fan fiction or something like that, right?

509
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,199
Speaker 0: And that's pretty big, there's a lot of Harry Potter fan fictions out there.

510
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:10,800
Speaker 0: But no one of them is like ridiculously trafficked, or, and the community that is writing and reading these is not a broad spreading community that's going to bust out, right?

511
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:19,580
Speaker 0: Not like the pony community knows how to bring the ponies into everyday things, you know, to spread to the non-pony people, to spread over the whole internet, to branch out.

512
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:23,240
Speaker 0: So that, and no matter where you are on the internet, you'll fall into pony at some point.

513
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:29,760
Speaker 0: Whereas, you can go all over the internet in normal places, you know, like Reddits and whatnot, and never fall into Homestuck.

514
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,960
Speaker 0: But you can't avoid, say, pony, because, you know, the way in which it is used.

515
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,900
Speaker 0: Somebody should research this, Alex Levitt.

516
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,020
Speaker 1: Well, you know, we did that panel where we kind of talked about this.

517
00:31:39,402 --> 00:31:41,459
Speaker 1: I want to expand that panel and add Homestuck to it.

518
00:31:41,721 --> 00:31:42,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway.

519
00:31:42,541 --> 00:31:43,280
Speaker 1: Anyway, this is my thing of the day.

520
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:44,020
Speaker 0: I have a thing of the day too.

521
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,299
Speaker 1: This thing is pretty good, and you should watch it.

522
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,539
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay, it's okay.

523
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,200
Speaker 0: So, you know Reggie Watts, fuck shit stack.

524
00:31:51,102 --> 00:31:51,678
Speaker 0: The awesome guy.

525
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,720
Speaker 0: That's a pretty good song.

526
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,460
Speaker 0: So this is actually an old video, but I've never seen it, and whatever.

527
00:31:56,961 --> 00:32:00,760
Speaker 0: It's actually from November 2011, so nah, it's almost a year old.

528
00:32:01,322 --> 00:32:05,956
Speaker 0: He was the performer, the final performer, on the Pop Tech 2011 stage, right?

529
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:13,060
Speaker 0: So in this performance, which is 30 minutes long, but well worth watching for the entire 30 minutes, right?

530
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:21,580
Speaker 0: He does a lot of awesome music, and he uses like a, you know, a sampling machine and a microphone to like mix his own beatboxing together, right?

531
00:32:22,542 --> 00:32:32,880
Speaker 0: But mostly, sort of what he's doing is, he's basically making fun of all those typical inspiring tech conference speeches.

532
00:32:34,461 --> 00:32:36,366
Speaker 0: And it's just the way he is like.

533
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:41,680
Speaker 0: lambasting and satiring them is so great, because whatever.

534
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,840
Speaker 1: I've usually heard that word pronounced lambast.

535
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,940
Speaker 0: Lambast, okay, whatever.

536
00:32:46,221 --> 00:32:46,540
Speaker 0: I don't know.

537
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:48,239
Speaker 0: I like bass because it's more like a turkey.

538
00:32:48,762 --> 00:32:49,940
Speaker 1: Well, you're lambasting.

539
00:32:50,085 --> 00:32:50,519
Speaker 0: Right, exactly.

540
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,019
Speaker 0: It sounds, you know, even if it's wrong, which it could be, because I don't know.

541
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,020
Speaker 0: It's sort of like, you know, if you're, you know, basting sounds more like an attack.

542
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,300
Speaker 0: You know, you're squirting meat juice on them.

543
00:33:01,403 --> 00:33:05,260
Speaker 0: Anyway, whereas basting, it's like, okay, you've basted me.

544
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,659
Speaker 0: What is, is it like bastarding?

545
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,200
Speaker 0: It's like, it doesn't sound like the right verb.

546
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:28,700
Speaker 0: Anyway, but yeah, if you have seen like those sort of stereotypical, like when some like web designer gives an inspiring speech at the tech conference, you know, with all those buzzwords and, you know, vision and, you know, that kind of, you know, highfalutin kind of, you know, reach for the stars kind of bullshit.

547
00:33:29,421 --> 00:33:34,520
Speaker 0: To see someone tear that apart the way that I always, I always try to tear it apart in quite a literal direct way.

548
00:33:34,601 --> 00:33:36,220
Speaker 0: Like, yeah, that's just a bunch of bullshit.

549
00:33:36,842 --> 00:33:39,535
Speaker 0: But to see someone tear it apart in this way is, is poetic.

550
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:43,059
Speaker 0: And the music is awesome too.

551
00:33:43,202 --> 00:33:43,839
Speaker 0: So do not miss.

552
00:33:44,764 --> 00:33:46,620
Speaker 1: The music in that Homestuck thing is actually pretty good.

553
00:33:46,841 --> 00:33:47,500
Speaker 1: I wonder how much.

554
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,420
Speaker 0: Is it music from Homestuck or is it just a music that someone put on it?

555
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,538
Speaker 1: It's a music someone put on it.

556
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,519
Speaker 1: But that song won.

557
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,560
Speaker 0: Does Homestuck have music?

558
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,200
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm sure.

559
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,400
Speaker 1: As far as I can tell.

560
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,017
Speaker 0: These flash parts, they could easily.

561
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,660
Speaker 1: I never got to music in all, as far as I read.

562
00:34:01,161 --> 00:34:02,520
Speaker 0: Because they could put music in there.

563
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,920
Speaker 0: Like you get to a flash movie, you push play and music happens.

564
00:34:05,162 --> 00:34:05,420
Speaker 0: I don't know.

565
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:05,900
Speaker 1: I don't know.

566
00:34:06,202 --> 00:34:07,516
Speaker 1: I never got to music in anything.

567
00:34:07,557 --> 00:34:07,820
Speaker 1: I read.

568
00:34:08,049 --> 00:34:08,219
Speaker 1: Okay.

569
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:15,100
Speaker 1: But that song reeks of the song someone uses to make a super serial anime music video.

570
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:24,817
Speaker 1: So in the meta moment book club book, the man who was Thursday, a book that is over a hundred years old.

571
00:34:25,525 --> 00:34:26,360
Speaker 0: So it's free legally.

572
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:27,880
Speaker 0: It's about police and anarchists.

573
00:34:28,281 --> 00:34:33,429
Speaker 1: And I bought the Kindle version and seeing what other people have highlighted in this book.

574
00:34:33,962 --> 00:34:35,418
Speaker 0: Oh, you actually don't turn that shit off.

575
00:34:35,784 --> 00:34:36,579
Speaker 1: I let it be there.

576
00:34:36,822 --> 00:34:37,757
Speaker 0: I turn that shit off.

577
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,100
Speaker 1: It's interesting to see what people highlighted.

578
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,880
Speaker 0: Oh, you have the legal Kindle version.

579
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:42,237
Speaker 0: Yes.

580
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:44,319
Speaker 0: Oh, see, I never, I never pay.

581
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,360
Speaker 1: It was like a dollar ninety nine.

582
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:53,040
Speaker 0: I actually paid for the paper, uh, penguin books edition because number one, the penguin classics always have fancy shit in them.

583
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,719
Speaker 0: But two, the book cover was just so good.

584
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,399
Speaker 0: I wanted to reward whoever the cover artist with whatever pennies and royalties they get.

585
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:07,160
Speaker 0: So, uh, I recommend even you should read it for free probably because most people don't have five bucks to just waste on a free book.

586
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:18,335
Speaker 0: You could spend that on another book like next book club book, but go to Amazon and look at the Oxford, you know, uh, not Oxford, penguin classics edition of The Man Who Was Thursday.

587
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,279
Speaker 0: And look at that cover.

588
00:35:19,604 --> 00:35:20,339
Speaker 0: That is the cover.

589
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:27,898
Speaker 1: The book's OK, but I got to say, it reminds me of literally this is something a middle school teacher makes you read and write an essay on.

590
00:35:29,449 --> 00:35:29,700
Speaker 0: Maybe.

591
00:35:30,182 --> 00:35:30,446
Speaker 0: I haven't.

592
00:35:30,648 --> 00:35:31,540
Speaker 0: I've only read two chapters.

593
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,760
Speaker 1: Oh, you haven't even gotten to anything yet.

594
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:37,080
Speaker 0: I stopped and started reading comics because the comics are piling quite high.

595
00:35:37,663 --> 00:35:39,000
Speaker 0: They're like maybe up to my head.

596
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,406
Speaker 0: It was Thursday.

597
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,900
Speaker 1: It takes like a day to read.

598
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,727
Speaker 0: Which day am I going to choose for reading?

599
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:46,340
Speaker 0: Thursday on Thursday?

600
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,617
Speaker 0: I'm going to be on the Atomic Tribute War 9000 podcast.

601
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:57,640
Speaker 0: Oh, well, Friday, Phil and Cher coming over, which is going to be aired some weeks later than that, maybe during the PAX week.

602
00:35:57,741 --> 00:35:58,958
Speaker 0: So that'll give you something to listen to.

603
00:35:59,362 --> 00:36:01,398
Speaker 0: I don't know how long it takes between recording and playing.

604
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:02,759
Speaker 0: That's up to someone else.

605
00:36:02,941 --> 00:36:05,360
Speaker 1: I was on that a while ago and it was super fun.

606
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,359
Speaker 0: I think it's been my third time on it.

607
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:07,799
Speaker 0: I remember.

608
00:36:07,881 --> 00:36:09,096
Speaker 1: I've only been on it once.

609
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,600
Speaker 1: I've been on more Friday night party lines because you really ignored that.

610
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,820
Speaker 1: But I kept doing it occasionally.

611
00:36:15,341 --> 00:36:17,800
Speaker 0: Um, what are the meta moments do we have?

612
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:21,920
Speaker 1: We're going to be a PAX dev, academia versus reality, psychology, game theory and games.

613
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:26,860
Speaker 1: We're going to be at PAX Prime, short subjects in gaming and the Geek Nights board game workshop.

614
00:36:27,362 --> 00:36:27,473
Speaker 0: Nice.

615
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,177
Speaker 0: What are we doing?

616
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,220
Speaker 0: Board game workshop.

617
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:29,958
Speaker 1: We are going to.

618
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,780
Speaker 1: So dive into tabletop gaming.

619
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,300
Speaker 1: Remin Scott, host of Geek Nights are here to teach you to play.

620
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,959
Speaker 1: And more importantly, to win.

621
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:44,740
Speaker 1: Agricola is a super popular resource management game with little wooden animals and surprising strategic depth.

622
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:50,600
Speaker 1: Carcassonne is a classic tile laying area control game that teaches you the fundamentals of optimal play and point denial.

623
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:56,018
Speaker 1: We're here to teach you both first the rules, then the strategy and a hands on workshop with no experience necessary.

624
00:36:56,485 --> 00:36:56,616
Speaker 0: Okay.

625
00:36:56,741 --> 00:36:57,874
Speaker 1: Saturday, September 1st, 8 p.m.

626
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,961
Speaker 0: Room 302.

627
00:36:59,961 --> 00:37:01,259
Speaker 1: I think that's in the Red Lion.

628
00:37:01,823 --> 00:37:05,059
Speaker 0: You should subscribe to the newsletter because I'm about to send another one out.

629
00:37:06,062 --> 00:37:08,020
Speaker 0: I remember the milk just said, hey, send the newsletter.

630
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,240
Speaker 1: There's some new videos.

631
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:16,799
Speaker 0: And also, if you want Geek Nights to be, if you want to follow us somewhere on the Internet, like we're not on Tumblr right now.

632
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:25,240
Speaker 0: If you want to like, you know, if that's the thing that you want, you know, if you want there to be like a Geek Nights Reddit or something, you know, a subreddit that is the Geek Nights subreddit.

633
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:28,000
Speaker 0: If you want these things, tell me and I will make them.

634
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:40,020
Speaker 0: If there's some new place on the Internet that just appeared that, you know, is like the new place and they have, you know, ways for us to post things like, you know, to make a Geek Nights page or account or whatever that you can follow.

635
00:37:40,822 --> 00:37:43,179
Speaker 0: And you want us to be there because you like using that thing.

636
00:37:43,741 --> 00:37:45,799
Speaker 0: Tell us about the thing and we will go there.

637
00:37:46,741 --> 00:37:53,839
Speaker 0: But for now, we are on Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter, our website, RSS feed, iTunes and email newsletter.

638
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:59,140
Speaker 1: And if you want us to come to a convention because you do do a lot of conventions, there's videos of our stuff at conventions.

639
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:05,260
Speaker 1: Don't ask us to go to a convention if you're just someone who also goes to the convention.

640
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,056
Speaker 1: That doesn't help us.

641
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,122
Speaker 1: We go to.

642
00:38:07,142 --> 00:38:10,800
Speaker 1: we go to so many conventions that we can't just add another one to our schedule willy nilly.

643
00:38:11,481 --> 00:38:16,280
Speaker 1: So if you would like us to appear at a convention, ask the convention to invite us.

644
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,178
Speaker 0: That is correct.

645
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:23,160
Speaker 1: Because if they talk to us, then we can actually sort out the details like hotel or badges.

646
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,819
Speaker 0: when you compensate me for my unpaid vacation day.

647
00:38:27,712 --> 00:38:27,838
Speaker 0: Yes.

648
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:34,800
Speaker 0: But yeah, I mean, if someone pays for everything, even the unpaid vacation day, I will go to any convention.

649
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,840
Speaker 0: I'll go to freaking Alaska, Saskatoon.

650
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,078
Speaker 1: There are conventions I would not bother with.

651
00:38:41,363 --> 00:38:44,360
Speaker 1: I don't know, because I can't even think of them because they're so sad.

652
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:50,020
Speaker 1: I remember a time ago where there were more guests than attendees.

653
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:55,690
Speaker 0: But even if it is so sad, going to it generates the awesome stories, especially if it's far away.

654
00:38:56,521 --> 00:38:56,840
Speaker 0: It depends.

655
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,980
Speaker 0: It's a free adventure.

656
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,319
Speaker 0: I don't give a shit if no one's there.

657
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,599
Speaker 0: That would actually be kind of awesome.

658
00:39:01,243 --> 00:39:01,458
Speaker 1: All right.

659
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:06,120
Speaker 1: So you want to you want to fly to out of somewhere in Idaho, do a convention for one person?

660
00:39:06,641 --> 00:39:12,378
Speaker 0: We would have after we did the panel for that one person and we left because we'd only be there for the one panel.

661
00:39:12,982 --> 00:39:15,920
Speaker 0: We'd have all this free paid for time there in Idaho.

662
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,540
Speaker 0: The potatoes would be so unbelievable.

663
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,799
Speaker 1: You know, I travel a lot for work and I got to say it gets to a point when you're kind of sick of airports.

664
00:39:30,303 --> 00:39:31,418
Speaker 0: I'm sick of airports now.

665
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,040
Speaker 0: What are you talking about?

666
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,040
Speaker 1: Granted, without the TSA, it's so much nicer everywhere else.

667
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,179
Speaker 1: But anyway, we digress.

668
00:39:37,601 --> 00:39:38,759
Speaker 0: Let's actually do a main bit here.

669
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:46,758
Speaker 1: So I go to Starbucks a lot and not, you know, I had a Starbucks card because it actually just gets you free coffee.

670
00:39:47,269 --> 00:39:47,457
Speaker 1: Yeah.

671
00:39:47,882 --> 00:39:49,259
Speaker 1: So there's no reason not to have it.

672
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,818
Speaker 0: I have a reason not to have it.

673
00:39:51,626 --> 00:39:52,360
Speaker 1: You don't go to Starbucks.

674
00:39:52,742 --> 00:39:53,778
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got it.

675
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,739
Speaker 0: I don't think they give you free apple fritters if I buy enough apple fritters.

676
00:39:57,682 --> 00:39:59,640
Speaker 1: No, they give you one free drink of your choice.

677
00:40:00,301 --> 00:40:00,708
Speaker 1: Every 15 times.

678
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,860
Speaker 0: If they had the apple fritter plan, I would sign up.

679
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,600
Speaker 0: But actually, I don't even want that.

680
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,040
Speaker 0: What I want is the bacon, egg and cheese plan at Toasty's.

681
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:08,799
Speaker 0: That's what I want.

682
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,620
Speaker 1: There's nowhere good to get a bagel near my office.

683
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,220
Speaker 0: Right under me is Toasty's.

684
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,900
Speaker 0: They got a big line and the guy even just he remembers everybody.

685
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:18,579
Speaker 0: So I just walk in.

686
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,260
Speaker 0: He's like, you want bacon, egg and cheese and everything bagel?

687
00:40:20,301 --> 00:40:21,000
Speaker 0: I don't even say anything.

688
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,599
Speaker 0: He just makes it.

689
00:40:22,404 --> 00:40:26,598
Speaker 0: And he's like, you know, it's like the one guy, he knows everyone's orders and everyone else makes the stuff.

690
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:37,440
Speaker 1: So I generally I don't like carrying cash because as soon as you know, I've got a 20 as soon as I buy anything, then it's a bunch of wads that get shoved in my pocket.

691
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,499
Speaker 0: You mean my ones that I leave on my desk at home?

692
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:44,555
Speaker 1: And so right now on my desk is easily like $40 in singles.

693
00:40:46,984 --> 00:40:48,198
Speaker 0: Yeah, what I tell you is the five.

694
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:55,279
Speaker 0: What I do is I, you know, I keep the big bills in the wallet and then all the other bills just throw my bag.

695
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,820
Speaker 0: And then when I get home, I just, you know, put the change in the in the change.

696
00:40:58,901 --> 00:41:00,359
Speaker 0: And I put the ones in the one pile.

697
00:41:00,741 --> 00:41:01,660
Speaker 1: My change thing is full.

698
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,755
Speaker 1: There's easily like $500 and change in that thing.

699
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,378
Speaker 0: You gotta cash that shit in.

700
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's heavy and I got to dump it somewhere.

701
00:41:08,021 --> 00:41:11,980
Speaker 1: So I hate carrying cash and I basically never use cash.

702
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:16,819
Speaker 1: In fact, I avoid any establishment that I can't pay with a credit card at.

703
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:20,240
Speaker 1: Like I almost never use cash.

704
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:24,140
Speaker 1: And when I do use cash, it's always this kind of like filthy experience.

705
00:41:24,602 --> 00:41:25,439
Speaker 1: That's been my whole life.

706
00:41:26,081 --> 00:41:33,940
Speaker 0: I actually use cash just to buy food, mostly like, you know, not the grocery store, but like bacon, egg and cheese or, you know, lunch or something like that.

707
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:43,320
Speaker 0: And then I know that since 99 percent of what I buy with cash is food, I basically look at how much money I took out of the ATM and how much money is still in the wallet.

708
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,240
Speaker 0: And I know how much I spent on food for when I do accounting.

709
00:41:45,823 --> 00:41:51,500
Speaker 1: I get the same thing because my credit card tells me where I bought everything from and conveniently breaks it into categories like food.

710
00:41:52,002 --> 00:41:54,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, a credit card does that as well.

711
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,219
Speaker 0: But I mean, just, you know, food is the only thing I spend cash on.

712
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,519
Speaker 1: I also don't get three percent cash back on cash.

713
00:42:01,246 --> 00:42:01,514
Speaker 0: That's true.

714
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,079
Speaker 1: I hate using cash.

715
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:08,017
Speaker 1: And this is a problem that was solved technologically 20 years ago.

716
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,940
Speaker 1: And yet somehow we've still got these grubby ass one dollar bills.

717
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,160
Speaker 0: Well, you know, I mean, we can replace them with coins or better bills.

718
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:15,844
Speaker 0: That's one.

719
00:42:16,005 --> 00:42:16,853
Speaker 0: Forget about that for now.

720
00:42:16,873 --> 00:42:17,600
Speaker 0: That's not part of the show.

721
00:42:18,382 --> 00:42:24,400
Speaker 0: But the other thing is that cash does have features that other things do not have.

722
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:25,640
Speaker 0: Anonymous.

723
00:42:25,981 --> 00:42:26,316
Speaker 1: Untraceable.

724
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,198
Speaker 1: Non-transactional.

725
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,740
Speaker 1: Bearer related.

726
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,760
Speaker 1: It's like a bearer bond without cash.

727
00:42:33,161 --> 00:42:34,579
Speaker 1: You realize Die Hard couldn't have happened.

728
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:34,846
Speaker 1: Yeah.

729
00:42:35,361 --> 00:42:36,680
Speaker 1: Cash or at least bearer bonds.

730
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:37,240
Speaker 1: And you know what?

731
00:42:37,601 --> 00:42:39,180
Speaker 1: They don't make bearer bonds anymore.

732
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:39,531
Speaker 0: Nope.

733
00:42:40,621 --> 00:42:49,359
Speaker 0: But another feature of cash is just that, you know, anyone can just grab it and use it without having to go through any sort of bureaucracy or other.

734
00:42:49,439 --> 00:42:49,600
Speaker 0: non.

735
00:42:49,722 --> 00:42:49,880
Speaker 0: Right.

736
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:55,399
Speaker 0: If you're like a poor person or a person who was just born or a person who, you know, who is really old and doesn't.

737
00:42:56,381 --> 00:42:58,500
Speaker 0: Anyone can just get cash and immediately use it.

738
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:06,719
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, if I give you like a CD rom, for example, it's useless unless you already have a computer with a CD and the whole thing set up with all the right software.

739
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,519
Speaker 0: It's like this prerequisite.

740
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,340
Speaker 0: There is no prerequisite for cash.

741
00:43:09,683 --> 00:43:11,580
Speaker 0: The dollar bill is the thing.

742
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,260
Speaker 0: It works all on its own.

743
00:43:13,441 --> 00:43:15,260
Speaker 0: You don't need anything else to make it go.

744
00:43:15,461 --> 00:43:15,915
Speaker 0: It just goes.

745
00:43:18,643 --> 00:43:22,620
Speaker 1: But I personally have no need for most of those features most of the time.

746
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:23,599
Speaker 0: I agree.

747
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:34,299
Speaker 1: So the thing, the situation is in a lot of the rest of the world, we have these awesome things like just using your phone as your wallet, not even needing to carry cards, just dupe.

748
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:37,898
Speaker 1: And then, you know, food comes out of the vending machine or dupe and you paid for whatever.

749
00:43:38,603 --> 00:43:42,718
Speaker 1: And somehow we've never gotten that in the US, but I guess I shouldn't say somehow.

750
00:43:43,243 --> 00:43:44,379
Speaker 0: Do we want to discuss the reasons?

751
00:43:45,441 --> 00:43:54,940
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about why don't we have all these cool things that the rest of the world has in the US in regards to paying for things, because I have one more anecdote.

752
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,520
Speaker 1: The reason I'm pissed off about this is that I was just in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

753
00:43:59,188 --> 00:43:59,619
Speaker 1: And you know what?

754
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:08,760
Speaker 1: When you're sitting in a restaurant, every restaurant, the crappest restaurant you can think of on the table, the little button, if you hit it, your waiter comes immediately.

755
00:44:09,242 --> 00:44:11,620
Speaker 1: Oh, and some restaurants have different buttons.

756
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,519
Speaker 1: One button says as a picture, clear the table.

757
00:44:15,101 --> 00:44:16,879
Speaker 1: Another button is bring me the check.

758
00:44:17,542 --> 00:44:19,559
Speaker 1: Another one is I want to order something else.

759
00:44:20,183 --> 00:44:22,359
Speaker 0: If we make a restaurant, we'll put that shit in there.

760
00:44:22,923 --> 00:44:24,520
Speaker 1: But that's that's a separate thing.

761
00:44:24,581 --> 00:44:25,879
Speaker 1: That's a dark age of restaurants.

762
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,048
Speaker 1: The separate we the the.

763
00:44:28,309 --> 00:44:37,000
Speaker 1: the cool feature was that when it's time to pay, they bring a little credit card machine over and they assume you're splitting the bill and ways, then being the number of people sitting at your table.

764
00:44:37,702 --> 00:44:39,440
Speaker 1: And they already know who ordered what.

765
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:42,040
Speaker 1: So literally, you just toss your credit cards to the person.

766
00:44:42,362 --> 00:44:45,424
Speaker 1: They swipe them all one by one and you all sign your receipts and you walk out.

767
00:44:46,307 --> 00:44:46,519
Speaker 1: Done.

768
00:44:47,361 --> 00:44:53,479
Speaker 1: To this day, no matter where I go, paying for the bill at a restaurant is a gigantic pain in the ass.

769
00:44:54,022 --> 00:44:55,539
Speaker 1: No restaurant will split the bill.

770
00:44:55,721 --> 00:44:57,338
Speaker 1: And in fact, they get pissed off if you ask.

771
00:44:57,882 --> 00:44:58,979
Speaker 0: Well, not all of them.

772
00:44:59,120 --> 00:44:59,596
Speaker 0: Most of them.

773
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:04,344
Speaker 0: But many, you know, it's like they can do it, but it's just easier for them not to.

774
00:45:04,364 --> 00:45:08,260
Speaker 0: And the reason it's easier for them not to is because their point of sale systems are shit, right?

775
00:45:08,341 --> 00:45:10,460
Speaker 0: Because you're expert at point of sale systems.

776
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:11,118
Speaker 0: You're not working at it.

777
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:15,140
Speaker 1: So you want to know why Brazil has these awesome point of sale systems?

778
00:45:15,881 --> 00:45:17,880
Speaker 1: This is how it was explained to me by a native.

779
00:45:18,301 --> 00:45:25,880
Speaker 1: He said that they bring the thing to the table because Brazil is a pretty violent crime ridden country, by and large.

780
00:45:26,481 --> 00:45:32,499
Speaker 1: And credit card cloning was so endemic that everyone refused to let the credit card out of their sight.

781
00:45:33,583 --> 00:45:35,600
Speaker 1: So they had to do the transaction at the table.

782
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:46,279
Speaker 1: But as soon as you had to make that ubiquitous, the transaction thing being at the table, then suddenly there's all these other things you can do because you can guarantee you'll have the thing at the table.

783
00:45:47,421 --> 00:45:51,140
Speaker 1: So I guess we just need there to be a huge crime wave of stolen credit cards.

784
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,960
Speaker 0: I mean, we have this technology in the U.S.

785
00:45:53,020 --> 00:46:00,699
Speaker 0: If you go to the Apple Store or Chipotle, it's like you can check out with just the people walking around with handheld point of sale credit card swipey things.

786
00:46:01,023 --> 00:46:02,460
Speaker 0: And they want you to use those.

787
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,600
Speaker 0: They don't want you to wait in the line.

788
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:10,740
Speaker 1: I'm just sick of the fact that if I have 12 friends, we go to a restaurant, we can't just split the bill and I just pay for what I ate.

789
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,380
Speaker 0: I don't know why the credit card thing is just built into the table.

790
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:26,258
Speaker 1: So the credit card, all these transactions still are reliant upon the credit card, which means that there's a third party taking a cut somewhere along the way.

791
00:46:26,981 --> 00:46:30,100
Speaker 1: Now, they don't take the cut from me, so I don't particularly care.

792
00:46:30,301 --> 00:46:33,040
Speaker 0: And they also give me a bunch of benefits.

793
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,419
Speaker 0: So that cut is actually partially going to me.

794
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,400
Speaker 0: I'm getting a piece of the cut, but why wouldn't I want that?

795
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,820
Speaker 1: They do take the cut from the other side and also restaurant's problem.

796
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:47,280
Speaker 1: They cut out all those other features of cash, like the deniability and the untraceability.

797
00:46:47,802 --> 00:46:51,789
Speaker 1: And that's why cabbies always lie to me and say, oh, credit card machine is broken.

798
00:46:51,829 --> 00:46:52,479
Speaker 1: You pay cash.

799
00:46:52,864 --> 00:46:53,660
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

800
00:46:53,941 --> 00:46:56,659
Speaker 0: You let me pay credit card or I call through on one.

801
00:46:56,946 --> 00:46:57,218
Speaker 1: Yep.

802
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,480
Speaker 1: And the thing is, that's not just a problem in the U.S.

803
00:47:00,641 --> 00:47:02,360
Speaker 1: In Turkey, in Germany.

804
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:03,579
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

805
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:07,340
Speaker 1: In Germany, every cab I took, the guy would be like, I do not speak English.

806
00:47:07,521 --> 00:47:08,720
Speaker 1: I'm like, whatever, credit card.

807
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,220
Speaker 1: He's like, no card.

808
00:47:10,321 --> 00:47:11,940
Speaker 1: And I just point as his credit card machine.

809
00:47:12,483 --> 00:47:14,499
Speaker 1: And he's like, no work, no work.

810
00:47:14,981 --> 00:47:18,120
Speaker 1: And one time I said, and I quote, you speak English.

811
00:47:18,343 --> 00:47:19,219
Speaker 1: I know you speak it.

812
00:47:19,383 --> 00:47:20,040
Speaker 1: I'm not an idiot.

813
00:47:20,202 --> 00:47:21,219
Speaker 1: I know you're lying to me.

814
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:21,918
Speaker 1: I'm from New York.

815
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,439
Speaker 1: Scan my fucking credit card or I'm calling the police.

816
00:47:25,621 --> 00:47:27,819
Speaker 0: And he scanned my credit card and I was on my way.

817
00:47:30,903 --> 00:47:35,400
Speaker 1: A Turkish guy, when he tried to pull it out of me, I was like, look, I know exactly the scam you're doing.

818
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:35,980
Speaker 1: I'm from New York.

819
00:47:36,041 --> 00:47:37,180
Speaker 1: Don't even try this shit on me.

820
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,438
Speaker 1: I'm going to call the police right now.

821
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:42,040
Speaker 1: And he was like, you got me here.

822
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:42,519
Speaker 1: No tip.

823
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,336
Speaker 1: Don't worry about it.

824
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:44,054
Speaker 1: You win.

825
00:47:46,741 --> 00:47:47,144
Speaker 0: Yeah, we should.

826
00:47:47,184 --> 00:47:49,177
Speaker 0: we should go with like, you know, like.

827
00:47:49,438 --> 00:47:52,779
Speaker 0: I wonder, what do you wear to make someone look at you and say, yeah, New York.

828
00:47:54,365 --> 00:47:56,198
Speaker 1: A middle finger raised at all times.

829
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:57,365
Speaker 0: I already wear that.

830
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,160
Speaker 1: A constant scowl.

831
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:00,999
Speaker 0: I already wear that.

832
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,299
Speaker 1: Particularly scowling at anyone who's slower than you or faster than you.

833
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:05,319
Speaker 0: I already got that down.

834
00:48:07,705 --> 00:48:08,640
Speaker 1: But there's the problem.

835
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:15,160
Speaker 1: Me as a consumer, I have the selfish interest in using a card for everything, because like I said, cash is disgusting.

836
00:48:17,402 --> 00:48:22,240
Speaker 1: But everyone else gets fucked by that because the credit card takes its share from everybody but me.

837
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:32,820
Speaker 0: I do feel the slightest bit bad about the merchants fee, because as much as I like receiving these benefits, you know, like Amazon points, I would rather have money go if I could choose how money was distributed.

838
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:40,100
Speaker 0: I would distribute the money to this nice restaurant that gives me delicious food and not to Visa, which is some nameless company that really isn't necessary.

839
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,107
Speaker 1: But I don't have to deal with.

840
00:48:41,228 --> 00:48:42,540
Speaker 1: I don't want to have to deal with cash.

841
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:43,399
Speaker 0: I do not.

842
00:48:43,901 --> 00:48:48,819
Speaker 1: So there's there's been this movement of all these attempts to make other systems to do this.

843
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:49,637
Speaker 0: Bitcoin lol.

844
00:48:49,961 --> 00:48:56,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, Bitcoin actually is being used a lot for mostly illicit bullshit and not for anything legitimate.

845
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,840
Speaker 1: But like Diwala and like Starbucks.

846
00:49:00,881 --> 00:49:01,620
Speaker 0: Well Diwala is not different.

847
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,180
Speaker 0: But yeah, talk about the Starbucks thing.

848
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:08,680
Speaker 1: So the Starbucks thing, basically I put money into a Starbucks thing, but I do it with the credit card.

849
00:49:08,921 --> 00:49:10,979
Speaker 0: So you're paying the merchant fee once, though.

850
00:49:11,305 --> 00:49:11,395
Speaker 0: Yeah.

851
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:21,980
Speaker 1: And I put like a hundred bucks in this Starbucks card, but I don't even need the physical card because there's an app on my phone that displays the the code that I can use to pay so I can pay for Starbucks stuff.

852
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:28,940
Speaker 0: The next version of iOS is actually going to have a single app that any app that basically does that, which is the display a card app.

853
00:49:29,421 --> 00:49:32,680
Speaker 0: All those display a card apps are going to be combined into one app.

854
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,359
Speaker 0: That is the display a card app.

855
00:49:34,684 --> 00:49:35,819
Speaker 0: That is the official Apple one.

856
00:49:36,302 --> 00:49:38,460
Speaker 0: So you won't have to like go make your own app.

857
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:42,600
Speaker 1: Well, the Starbucks one does one thing that it shows the status, like if you're a different status.

858
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, that's that's all included.

859
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,758
Speaker 0: They're making one app that does all of those.

860
00:49:46,047 --> 00:49:46,240
Speaker 0: Yeah.

861
00:49:46,401 --> 00:49:48,295
Speaker 1: So until there's a company doesn't want to use.

862
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,400
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, but it's the same way that the Apple will reject them because Apple's Apple, right?

863
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,499
Speaker 0: The same way they already have like the magazine app.

864
00:49:54,903 --> 00:49:55,998
Speaker 0: So that's built into iOS.

865
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:00,340
Speaker 0: So if you want to make an app that's a magazine, you don't you make them a magazine thing instead anyway.

866
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:01,291
Speaker 1: Yep.

867
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:05,780
Speaker 1: But the way it works is I just flash my card and no receipt, no nothing.

868
00:50:05,841 --> 00:50:07,199
Speaker 1: Now, it saves them the merchant fees.

869
00:50:07,901 --> 00:50:11,120
Speaker 0: Well, they still to pay a merchant fee when you put the money in the card.

870
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:11,587
Speaker 0: So it's.

871
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:17,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, but yeah, as opposed to a merchant's fee on everybody It's a five dollar card.

872
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,853
Speaker 0: But isn't the merchant fee a percentage of the money you give them?

873
00:50:19,893 --> 00:50:21,000
Speaker 0: so it ends up being the same?

874
00:50:21,723 --> 00:50:22,879
Speaker 1: No, it actually depends.

875
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:27,239
Speaker 1: There are different merchant agreements, partly for different credit cards like Visa versus Amex.

876
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:27,866
Speaker 0: That's true.

877
00:50:27,887 --> 00:50:28,700
Speaker 0: Amex is double.

878
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,760
Speaker 0: If you use an Amex, you're hurting the person you're buying from double.

879
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:36,520
Speaker 0: That's why Amex is accepted in so few or much fewer places than everywhere else.

880
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:44,858
Speaker 0: Because if you have like, you know, if you go into a place that, you know, is you're going to buy like something for a dollar and use an Amex, it's not even worth it for them to sell it to you.

881
00:50:45,261 --> 00:50:45,905
Speaker 1: That happened to me once.

882
00:50:45,965 --> 00:50:46,689
Speaker 1: I didn't have any cash.

883
00:50:46,729 --> 00:50:48,640
Speaker 1: I wanted to buy one D20 a millennium.

884
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:53,720
Speaker 1: And back then, they couldn't turn me down because of the rules about credit cards.

885
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:54,938
Speaker 0: Yeah, the rules have changed, son of a bitch.

886
00:50:55,581 --> 00:50:58,298
Speaker 1: So basically she was like, you know what, just take it.

887
00:50:59,040 --> 00:50:59,206
Speaker 0: Free D20.

888
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:05,397
Speaker 1: Now, theoretically, I just have said I would like to buy every single die.

889
00:51:05,417 --> 00:51:06,360
Speaker 1: you have one by one.

890
00:51:06,661 --> 00:51:08,759
Speaker 0: Yeah, they would have said, all right, you're paying for the rest of them.

891
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,439
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could have come in each day or walk by one, walk out, walk back in.

892
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,107
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if you buy one, walk out, walk back in.

893
00:51:14,147 --> 00:51:14,348
Speaker 0: Right.

894
00:51:14,389 --> 00:51:16,740
Speaker 0: So if it's the emergency is four percent.

895
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:17,262
Speaker 0: Right.

896
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:20,740
Speaker 0: Well, you're paying four percent of a D20 and then you're paying four percent.

897
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:23,169
Speaker 1: No, but it's not always a percent.

898
00:51:23,249 --> 00:51:23,731
Speaker 1: It's all there.

899
00:51:23,912 --> 00:51:25,780
Speaker 1: Sometimes you can have a set fee.

900
00:51:26,182 --> 00:51:27,415
Speaker 0: There's all different ways to do it.

901
00:51:27,435 --> 00:51:27,880
Speaker 0: That's rough.

902
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:32,798
Speaker 1: So Starbucks is probably better off having me put 50 or 100 bucks there every now and then.

903
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,613
Speaker 1: Then every four or 75 is a single.

904
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,139
Speaker 0: They're also better off because now that money is sitting with them.

905
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:41,839
Speaker 0: I gave the money.

906
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:43,858
Speaker 0: You're giving Starbucks a loan.

907
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:48,100
Speaker 1: Which is not that lucrative in the modern era when interest rates are basically zero.

908
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:48,905
Speaker 0: That's true.

909
00:51:48,965 --> 00:51:50,559
Speaker 0: But Starbucks isn't using that money.

910
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:55,280
Speaker 0: See, if you have the money, you would be using it to try to get interest and it would not be very good for you.

911
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:56,229
Speaker 0: But you know what?

912
00:51:56,249 --> 00:51:58,780
Speaker 1: Starbucks is using... Mine's in a money market account or equities.

913
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:02,800
Speaker 0: But Starbucks is using that money in the coffee bean commodities market.

914
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,620
Speaker 0: They're not using that loan money to go try to get interest from a savings account.

915
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:12,120
Speaker 0: So Starbucks, when they get a loan from you, they're better off than you are having a loan from them.

916
00:52:12,502 --> 00:52:14,599
Speaker 0: Because they can actually do something with that money.

917
00:52:17,121 --> 00:52:21,340
Speaker 1: But we've never had the pay for stuff with cell phones that was ubiquitous in the U.S.

918
00:52:21,742 --> 00:52:23,339
Speaker 1: Even though in Asia it's actually pretty common.

919
00:52:25,504 --> 00:52:27,252
Speaker 1: And I feel like it's the way to go.

920
00:52:27,272 --> 00:52:28,960
Speaker 1: I don't even want to carry my stupid wallet.

921
00:52:29,522 --> 00:52:30,240
Speaker 0: Oh, yep, yep.

922
00:52:31,222 --> 00:52:37,072
Speaker 0: So here's the reasons why it has not taken off in the U.S Number one, not everyone has a smartphone.

923
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:39,220
Speaker 0: Even though a lot of people do, not everyone, right?

924
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:44,960
Speaker 0: So if you put this thing on vending machines and stores and all these places, right?

925
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:55,700
Speaker 0: Why would a store go through the trouble of installing this thing that only a fraction of people will use, can use, and only a fraction of those people will use, right?

926
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,347
Speaker 0: You get this chicken and egg situation.

927
00:52:57,427 --> 00:53:00,100
Speaker 0: Even people who have smartphones won't be able to figure it out or bother.

928
00:53:00,482 --> 00:53:03,875
Speaker 0: They've had credit cards that you don't have to swipe, that you just sort of have RFID.

929
00:53:04,196 --> 00:53:05,100
Speaker 0: People don't even use those.

930
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,907
Speaker 1: Well, those were extra stupid because they don't solve you anything.

931
00:53:07,927 --> 00:53:11,737
Speaker 1: You have to carry the same thing and interact with it in the same way.

932
00:53:11,757 --> 00:53:13,100
Speaker 1: Just more glitchily.

933
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:19,519
Speaker 0: And the other thing is, you're going to go through all the effort of signing up for this thing and maybe two places you go actually have it.

934
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:23,994
Speaker 0: And that place can't just, you can maybe get more people to use it.

935
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:25,380
Speaker 0: if a really popular place.

936
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:27,747
Speaker 0: Like let's say McDonald's said you must pay with your phone.

937
00:53:28,109 --> 00:53:28,309
Speaker 0: Yeah.

938
00:53:28,409 --> 00:53:28,911
Speaker 0: OK, great.

939
00:53:28,951 --> 00:53:31,780
Speaker 0: Now all the poor people who go to McDonald's can't go there anymore, period.

940
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,449
Speaker 0: So it's chicken and egg.

941
00:53:33,469 --> 00:53:34,560
Speaker 0: McDonald's would never do that.

942
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:38,860
Speaker 1: The only reason Starbucks was able to pull this off, to get someone like me even to use it and to get it to be used a lot.

943
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,316
Speaker 0: Because the kind of people who go to Starbucks are smartphone kind of people.

944
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:42,502
Speaker 1: Not even that.

945
00:53:42,924 --> 00:53:46,760
Speaker 1: It's simply that they had a rewards program and they just rolled it in.

946
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:52,580
Speaker 1: So it's basically the phone is just a convenience for the people who are already using their reward program.

947
00:53:52,821 --> 00:53:55,628
Speaker 0: I have physical cards for the program if you don't have them.

948
00:53:55,648 --> 00:53:57,112
Speaker 1: Yeah, the app isn't something fancy.

949
00:53:57,132 --> 00:54:00,060
Speaker 1: It literally just displays the code that's on my card.

950
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:00,520
Speaker 0: Yep.

951
00:54:01,203 --> 00:54:03,412
Speaker 0: It doesn't have near field communications or anything.

952
00:54:03,432 --> 00:54:05,420
Speaker 1: But I used it for the first time yesterday.

953
00:54:05,901 --> 00:54:07,247
Speaker 1: I ran like over to Brooklyn.

954
00:54:07,267 --> 00:54:10,200
Speaker 1: I went this long run and I want to carry my wallet because I'm out running.

955
00:54:10,661 --> 00:54:13,632
Speaker 1: But of course I have my phone because you never fucking know.

956
00:54:14,335 --> 00:54:15,620
Speaker 1: So I'm running and I'm thirsty.

957
00:54:17,382 --> 00:54:18,227
Speaker 1: I had the phone.

958
00:54:18,247 --> 00:54:20,459
Speaker 1: I went to Starbucks and bought water with the phone.

959
00:54:20,741 --> 00:54:21,102
Speaker 1: Yeah.

960
00:54:21,543 --> 00:54:26,920
Speaker 1: I love the idea that I want to do a separate show on this, but the guest we're going to have on to do the show couldn't come tonight.

961
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:27,823
Speaker 1: We'll get him some other time.

962
00:54:29,207 --> 00:54:33,420
Speaker 1: There's all this debate about like phones and tablets and the features and all these.

963
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,951
Speaker 1: To me, it's not even a telephone.

964
00:54:35,991 --> 00:54:37,980
Speaker 1: The thing I carry around is not a telephone.

965
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:43,500
Speaker 0: We only call it a phone because, you know, it was a device that came from the cellular phone.

966
00:54:43,901 --> 00:54:48,520
Speaker 0: It's just that we attached the computer to the cellular phone and people stopped using the phone part.

967
00:54:49,043 --> 00:54:51,260
Speaker 0: But we still call it phone because of its history.

968
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:59,220
Speaker 1: But to me, what it should be is this universal data platform that just does pretty much everything I need and is always connected to everything.

969
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,469
Speaker 0: Now, the other reason these things fail in the U.S.

970
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:03,920
Speaker 0: is actually because of geography, right?

971
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:12,000
Speaker 0: In Japan, you know, there's a lot of people there and a lot of stores, you know, or, you know, even in other Asian places, lots of people in lots of places.

972
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:16,593
Speaker 0: But it's physically not geographically large.

973
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:19,200
Speaker 0: There aren't that many square miles to cover.

974
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:19,783
Speaker 0: Right.

975
00:55:19,803 --> 00:55:22,237
Speaker 0: So even though it's not a cell tower situation.

976
00:55:22,659 --> 00:55:22,860
Speaker 0: Right.

977
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:33,860
Speaker 0: Think about how many you have to set up, how many you have to make to deploy this kind of system with any kind of, you know, breath that will actually catch on in the U.S.

978
00:55:34,281 --> 00:55:34,542
Speaker 0: Right.

979
00:55:34,843 --> 00:55:38,819
Speaker 0: If you want to try something out, I mean, like mini disk was successful in Japan.

980
00:55:38,899 --> 00:55:39,080
Speaker 0: Right.

981
00:55:39,421 --> 00:55:45,100
Speaker 1: You know, it's like there's something about, you know, it would have been successful here had it not been for draconian copyright restrictions on its use.

982
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:45,681
Speaker 0: Of course.

983
00:55:45,761 --> 00:55:58,160
Speaker 0: But I'm saying is that, you know, when you have to cover a big stretch of land, even when you're not covering a big stretch of people, you know, the distribution of things, even though you have this Internet connecting that space shouldn't matter.

984
00:55:58,581 --> 00:55:58,761
Speaker 0: Right.

985
00:55:58,781 --> 00:56:05,600
Speaker 0: It's like, OK, so now this gas station in the desert needs to have Internet and it never has and it never will.

986
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:06,422
Speaker 0: Now is dial up.

987
00:56:06,442 --> 00:56:07,163
Speaker 0: It doesn't even work.

988
00:56:07,263 --> 00:56:08,947
Speaker 0: And yeah, cash actually works out there.

989
00:56:09,007 --> 00:56:09,187
Speaker 0: Right.

990
00:56:09,588 --> 00:56:13,716
Speaker 0: So, you know, but when you're, you know, your whole country is basically one city.

991
00:56:13,756 --> 00:56:15,480
Speaker 0: that's all squished up nice and tight.

992
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,703
Speaker 0: Everyone has, you know, Internet.

993
00:56:17,883 --> 00:56:18,424
Speaker 0: You're all good.

994
00:56:18,765 --> 00:56:19,487
Speaker 0: You don't have to worry.

995
00:56:19,507 --> 00:56:20,910
Speaker 0: So the geography of the

996
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:21,250
Speaker 0: U.S.,

997
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:25,960
Speaker 0: even though our population is low compared to a lot of these people and our population density is low.

998
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:30,049
Speaker 0: How much intensity being low actually hurts when more people are in a smaller space?

999
00:56:30,069 --> 00:56:34,900
Speaker 0: You can all get them to all adapt onto this new system and, you know, get the thing to spread more.

1000
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:40,692
Speaker 0: It's like the same way that like an actual virus, if everyone's living all packed in, the virus will infect everyone real quick.

1001
00:56:41,032 --> 00:56:44,720
Speaker 0: But if everyone's spread out, the virus has a hard time infecting the people in the boonies.

1002
00:56:45,261 --> 00:56:57,020
Speaker 1: Now, there's also a kind of like even deeper technological hurdle that to this day, it is easier to hand someone a business card than it is to have two smartphones and go boop, because that boop never actually works.

1003
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:00,499
Speaker 0: Well, that's, you know, because everyone has different shit.

1004
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:01,061
Speaker 1: Yup.

1005
00:57:01,262 --> 00:57:03,367
Speaker 1: And with the so forget the tech side.

1006
00:57:03,407 --> 00:57:04,590
Speaker 1: Let's look at the business side.

1007
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:08,740
Speaker 1: The Starbucks thing only works because I already gave my money to Starbucks.

1008
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:13,308
Speaker 1: So I can't have if I have a general purpose app.

1009
00:57:13,689 --> 00:57:16,616
Speaker 1: Now I have to give money to something or tied to a bank account.

1010
00:57:16,656 --> 00:57:18,020
Speaker 1: So there has to be a middleman again.

1011
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:18,861
Speaker 1: Yup.

1012
00:57:19,142 --> 00:57:21,006
Speaker 1: There's no technological way to do that.

1013
00:57:21,066 --> 00:57:21,527
Speaker 1: That's safe.

1014
00:57:21,908 --> 00:57:23,070
Speaker 1: So we need something.

1015
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:24,573
Speaker 1: And who has done that before?

1016
00:57:24,593 --> 00:57:27,980
Speaker 1: A horrible, evil PayPal that I hate, have never used.

1017
00:57:29,321 --> 00:57:30,282
Speaker 0: I use them, but they're evil.

1018
00:57:30,543 --> 00:57:32,106
Speaker 1: I have never had a PayPal account.

1019
00:57:32,206 --> 00:57:32,486
Speaker 1: Nice.

1020
00:57:32,787 --> 00:57:38,637
Speaker 1: I have only ever used them in terms of paying other suckers who have PayPal accounts and they take huge cuts.

1021
00:57:38,677 --> 00:57:39,519
Speaker 1: And there's all these problems.

1022
00:57:39,559 --> 00:57:40,260
Speaker 1: I hate PayPal.

1023
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:48,951
Speaker 1: There's Diwala, which lets me transfer money because remember, the killer app here isn't buying stuff because I have credit cards to do that now.

1024
00:57:49,292 --> 00:57:51,615
Speaker 1: I can't swipe a credit card on Scott and give him money.

1025
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:54,940
Speaker 1: I very often need to give a friend of mine like 10 bucks.

1026
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:03,632
Speaker 0: You know, a lot of people are doing now is you can use, for example, on your phone, I can use like the Chase Bank app and try to give you money.

1027
00:58:04,053 --> 00:58:08,240
Speaker 0: But it's like we have to sit there with our phones typing in all this information and stuff like that.

1028
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:11,694
Speaker 1: I can send money from Chase to an email address and then they can claim it.

1029
00:58:12,075 --> 00:58:13,100
Speaker 1: But even then, that's a pain.

1030
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:13,521
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1031
00:58:13,821 --> 00:58:18,870
Speaker 0: Well, actually, I was at a restaurant recently with some people I had just met that day and I haven't spoken to them since.

1032
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:19,391
Speaker 0: But whatever.

1033
00:58:19,431 --> 00:58:20,513
Speaker 0: It's New York.

1034
00:58:21,094 --> 00:58:22,657
Speaker 0: And we're like they were.

1035
00:58:22,677 --> 00:58:23,218
Speaker 0: they were all these.

1036
00:58:23,418 --> 00:58:24,320
Speaker 0: they were much younger than me.

1037
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:25,623
Speaker 0: And they, you know, had that typical.

1038
00:58:25,683 --> 00:58:26,785
Speaker 0: how do we pay drama.

1039
00:58:27,085 --> 00:58:27,807
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

1040
00:58:27,947 --> 00:58:28,829
Speaker 0: So I'm just.

1041
00:58:28,869 --> 00:58:31,855
Speaker 0: I was just ignoring it and I was just waiting till whatever they were doing was done.

1042
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:33,879
Speaker 0: And then I was going to take care of my bit and then get out of there.

1043
00:58:33,919 --> 00:58:34,060
Speaker 0: Right.

1044
00:58:34,561 --> 00:58:39,570
Speaker 0: But one of the girls, she had square that little thing where you can accept payments, like if you're in an artist's alley.

1045
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:40,251
Speaker 0: Right.

1046
00:58:40,472 --> 00:58:45,000
Speaker 0: So basically everyone just swiped our credit cards on her phone paying her.

1047
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:46,984
Speaker 0: She paid all these merchant fees through square.

1048
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:47,986
Speaker 0: But that's not my problem.

1049
00:58:48,407 --> 00:58:54,160
Speaker 0: So basically everyone just swiped their credit card on her phone, typed in a number of dollars and she took money from everyone.

1050
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:55,825
Speaker 0: And then she paid for the whole thing with her card.

1051
00:58:55,925 --> 00:58:57,991
Speaker 0: And, you know, but it's like, great.

1052
00:58:58,231 --> 00:59:00,156
Speaker 0: So now someone, you know, has to be a merchant.

1053
00:59:00,397 --> 00:59:01,440
Speaker 0: Everyone has to be a merchant.

1054
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,144
Speaker 0: It's like, no, this is that what this is.

1055
00:59:04,204 --> 00:59:11,856
Speaker 0: It's another one of those cases where, you know, in the olden days, it used to be there was a music producer and then to be music listeners.

1056
00:59:11,916 --> 00:59:14,400
Speaker 0: But now everyone is both producer and listener.

1057
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,724
Speaker 0: This is, you know, this old model is.

1058
00:59:16,744 --> 00:59:22,033
Speaker 0: there are merchants and then there are customers like, no, nowadays everyone's a merchant.

1059
00:59:22,093 --> 00:59:22,995
Speaker 0: It's flattened out.

1060
00:59:23,075 --> 00:59:23,496
Speaker 0: It's not.

1061
00:59:23,656 --> 00:59:25,980
Speaker 0: it doesn't have this to roll system anymore.

1062
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:33,450
Speaker 0: It's everyone does all the roles and you just sort of change this dual view mentality going on and come with something new.

1063
00:59:33,931 --> 00:59:40,760
Speaker 0: The problem with that is that it makes it very hard for any middlemen to exploit, which is why the middlemen constantly fight against this flattening.

1064
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,646
Speaker 1: But also simultaneously, we do still need a middleman.

1065
00:59:44,686 --> 00:59:48,894
Speaker 1: You have to have someone to actually make the money transaction happen.

1066
00:59:48,934 --> 00:59:50,436
Speaker 0: That is correct, because think about it.

1067
00:59:50,477 --> 00:59:52,420
Speaker 0: OK, what are we going to do if we don't have a middleman?

1068
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:55,065
Speaker 0: I have my phone and my phone says how many dollars I have.

1069
00:59:55,085 --> 00:59:57,530
Speaker 0: Your phone says how many dollars you have.

1070
00:59:57,770 --> 00:59:59,634
Speaker 0: And we touch phones and the numbers change.

1071
00:59:59,734 --> 01:00:00,716
Speaker 0: I'll just it's my phone.

1072
01:00:00,736 --> 01:00:02,439
Speaker 0: I'll just hack it and change the number.

1073
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:03,080
Speaker 0: Right.

1074
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:08,270
Speaker 0: No, there has to be some third party that says this is how much money Scott has.

1075
01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:10,935
Speaker 0: And it you know, I can't just go and change the number there.

1076
01:00:10,955 --> 01:00:13,460
Speaker 0: It can't be something that belongs to me or belongs to you.

1077
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:16,307
Speaker 0: It needs to be some trusted third party somehow.

1078
01:00:16,828 --> 01:00:17,049
Speaker 0: Right.

1079
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:20,097
Speaker 1: Well, theoretically, you could do it with a cryptographic.

1080
01:00:20,177 --> 01:00:21,320
Speaker 0: You could do the Bitcoin method.

1081
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,503
Speaker 1: Yes, which has some problems in and of itself.

1082
01:00:24,563 --> 01:00:24,864
Speaker 1: It does.

1083
01:00:24,944 --> 01:00:28,889
Speaker 1: But even there, finances are not simple at all.

1084
01:00:28,929 --> 01:00:37,860
Speaker 1: I mean, I have my checking account, my money market account, my equities, you know, my 401k, all these different sources of money that are more or less liquid.

1085
01:00:38,641 --> 01:00:40,486
Speaker 1: And I have to be able to pull the money out of them.

1086
01:00:40,506 --> 01:00:45,440
Speaker 0: And they're in banks and places where you need to be able to move the money between all the different places you can put money.

1087
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:54,560
Speaker 0: And so imagine if I turn all my money into bitcoins and I spent it as Bitcoin and even if all the restaurants and food places and everywhere took Bitcoin, I want to know I want to buy some stock with Bitcoin.

1088
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:55,862
Speaker 0: I want to put my 401k.

1089
01:00:55,922 --> 01:00:57,284
Speaker 0: I got to pay the doctor with Bitcoin.

1090
01:00:57,325 --> 01:00:58,887
Speaker 0: It's like it's not going to work.

1091
01:00:59,528 --> 01:01:00,290
Speaker 0: It's not going to happen.

1092
01:01:01,011 --> 01:01:06,240
Speaker 0: You need to have some common format of exchange, which cash is still the only one.

1093
01:01:06,581 --> 01:01:08,287
Speaker 0: You know, we already talked about some places.

1094
01:01:08,348 --> 01:01:11,560
Speaker 0: still don't accept credit card, but everyone takes cash.

1095
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:20,360
Speaker 1: And that credit card thing, though, is causing an interesting self-selection in that I personally really don't do business with anyone who only takes cash.

1096
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:22,860
Speaker 0: But what about those really good hole in the wall restaurants?

1097
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:24,323
Speaker 1: Those are the only places.

1098
01:01:24,383 --> 01:01:24,944
Speaker 0: That's right.

1099
01:01:25,025 --> 01:01:30,880
Speaker 1: But if I'm ordering food like I need to carry out, I'm only going to order not even someone who takes credit card, but someone who's on Grubhub.

1100
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:32,986
Speaker 1: I don't have to talk to a person.

1101
01:01:33,087 --> 01:01:33,709
Speaker 0: Me, too.

1102
01:01:34,071 --> 01:01:35,376
Speaker 1: But at a convention even.

1103
01:01:35,396 --> 01:01:36,360
Speaker 0: Except for the Chinese restaurant.

1104
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:40,760
Speaker 1: It's interesting how half the people in the artist's alleys actually can take credit cards these days.

1105
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:41,945
Speaker 0: Like I said, they have square.

1106
01:01:41,965 --> 01:01:42,045
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1107
01:01:42,788 --> 01:01:45,840
Speaker 1: But it's costing them a lot of money to do that relatively.

1108
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:58,780
Speaker 1: But more importantly, it's killing the people who don't have the barrier to entry of smartphone and the square device is pretty high for a lot of poor, like pre-college freshmen in college artists.

1109
01:01:59,441 --> 01:01:59,642
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1110
01:01:59,662 --> 01:02:05,320
Speaker 0: I mean, why can't we just get to the cowboy bebop era or the shadow run era where I have a crutch is basically the same thing.

1111
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:05,701
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1112
01:02:06,707 --> 01:02:09,320
Speaker 1: And shadow runs a little more depressive because they're not.

1113
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,680
Speaker 0: See, you know what I've always been curious about and I'm sure some nerd out there knows this, which is why I'm asking.

1114
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:14,364
Speaker 0: And I don't want to.

1115
01:02:14,545 --> 01:02:16,440
Speaker 0: I could search for it on Google, but I'm not going to bother.

1116
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:17,403
Speaker 0: What are you about to ask?

1117
01:02:17,423 --> 01:02:18,367
Speaker 0: Remember in Star Wars.

1118
01:02:18,668 --> 01:02:18,808
Speaker 0: Right.

1119
01:02:18,828 --> 01:02:19,451
Speaker 0: They have credits.

1120
01:02:19,993 --> 01:02:20,253
Speaker 0: Right.

1121
01:02:20,414 --> 01:02:22,040
Speaker 0: And they paid Lando his credits.

1122
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:26,420
Speaker 0: And you remember he was getting on to the Millennium Falcon when he was leaving, you know, Yavin.

1123
01:02:27,101 --> 01:02:32,140
Speaker 0: And he had like these ammo cases that presumably contained the credits that he was paid with.

1124
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:32,702
Speaker 0: Right.

1125
01:02:33,806 --> 01:02:36,657
Speaker 0: The credits in Star Wars world were physical somehow.

1126
01:02:36,697 --> 01:02:37,179
Speaker 0: They weren't.

1127
01:02:38,081 --> 01:02:38,803
Speaker 0: They're not digital.

1128
01:02:40,911 --> 01:02:41,774
Speaker 0: That's what I'm wondering about.

1129
01:02:41,814 --> 01:02:43,600
Speaker 0: What is what is an actual galactic credit?

1130
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:44,603
Speaker 0: Is it a piece of paper?

1131
01:02:44,684 --> 01:02:45,567
Speaker 0: Is it what is it?

1132
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:47,958
Speaker 0: Because he was carrying those boxes, remember?

1133
01:02:48,219 --> 01:02:48,420
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1134
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:51,309
Speaker 0: And he was like they were loading them onto the ship and you had to do they were.

1135
01:02:51,369 --> 01:02:54,700
Speaker 0: it was heavily implied that those were the credits the rebels paid him with.

1136
01:02:55,721 --> 01:02:56,244
Speaker 0: And he never gave.

1137
01:02:56,264 --> 01:02:57,753
Speaker 0: it didn't seem give those back either.

1138
01:02:58,176 --> 01:02:58,719
Speaker 1: Of course not.

1139
01:03:00,502 --> 01:03:03,820
Speaker 0: I mean, he we worked for them, but he didn't, you know, get the money anyway.

1140
01:03:04,241 --> 01:03:04,925
Speaker 1: Well, you keep that.

1141
01:03:04,965 --> 01:03:07,619
Speaker 1: There's a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow.

1142
01:03:08,421 --> 01:03:13,920
Speaker 0: Well, I think he took the sweat of his bro's sister more than the sweat of his brow.

1143
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,344
Speaker 1: Well, at least we know my little pony.

1144
01:03:16,385 --> 01:03:21,040
Speaker 1: It's bits and then there's pennies and actual coins made of a precious metal of some kind.

1145
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:22,083
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably gold.

1146
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:24,610
Speaker 1: Anyway, I don't know.

1147
01:03:24,931 --> 01:03:28,280
Speaker 1: I feel like we can do a deeper topic on this down the road of kind of the specifics.

1148
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:40,000
Speaker 1: But I just wanted to talk about as an overview, because it it annoys me that in this era, in the 21st century, in the year two thousand, we've invented better solutions and it takes a long time to actually get the solutions adapted.

1149
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,665
Speaker 0: Welcome to all of history.

1150
01:03:41,986 --> 01:03:43,672
Speaker 0: Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone.

1151
01:03:43,712 --> 01:03:46,060
Speaker 0: When did everyone actually start using telephones like crazy?

1152
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:52,159
Speaker 1: Decades later, we cell phones weren't really ubiquitous until we had cell phones.

1153
01:03:52,842 --> 01:03:53,725
Speaker 0: Not everyone really.

1154
01:03:53,785 --> 01:03:56,313
Speaker 0: Not everyone had them until like the mid 2000s, late 2000s, you know?

1155
01:03:58,720 --> 01:03:58,961
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1156
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:04,020
Speaker 1: There was a time when Scott was the only person in the front row crew who had a current working cell phone.

1157
01:04:04,803 --> 01:04:07,139
Speaker 1: When I got mine, that got us up to like three people.

1158
01:04:08,621 --> 01:04:10,650
Speaker 0: And this was in the century.

1159
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:12,097
Speaker 0: It was not in the 90s.

1160
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:19,676
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rym and Scott.

1161
01:04:19,716 --> 01:04:24,710
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.
