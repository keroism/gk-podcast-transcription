1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,009
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, December 15th, 2022.

2
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:10,250
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,567 --> 00:00:14,120
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:16,047
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:18,299
Speaker 0: We are talking about Hanukkah.

6
00:00:20,922 --> 00:00:26,260
Speaker 0: You know, it's only fair if Scott said he did a Christmas show.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,637
Speaker 1: I just don't have any other ideas.

8
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:30,459
Speaker 0: He did a Christmas show in 2016, but you say that.

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:50,580
Speaker 0: One thing, a common dynamic, especially for the listener who sometimes watches the livestream, especially when I click go live long before we actually start the show, when we're trying to figure out what show to do, the pattern is, I'll have 10 ideas that Scott vetoes, and Scott will have one idea that I veto, and then we're stuck, and then we proceed.

10
00:00:51,161 --> 00:00:55,579
Speaker 0: So I came up with a policy a long time ago, and this is the first time I was able to enact it.

11
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,092
Speaker 0: My policy was, if I ever say, "What should we do this show

12
00:00:59,253 --> 00:00:59,353
Speaker 0: on?"

13
00:00:59,695 --> 00:01:05,099
Speaker 0: and Scott suggests something, I will automatically select it no matter what and do the exact same thing he does to me.

14
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,466
Speaker 0: All right, you can drive.

15
00:01:06,728 --> 00:01:07,190
Speaker 0: Good idea.

16
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:07,713
Speaker 0: Let's do it.

17
00:01:07,994 --> 00:01:08,959
Speaker 0: I feel good about this show.

18
00:01:11,284 --> 00:01:12,459
Speaker 0: But I think there's enough to talk about.

19
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:17,240
Speaker 0: But in the open-y bit, as you know, I talked about on the show, we move pretty quick here.

20
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:28,560
Speaker 0: The 2012 Chevy Cruze that was a gift from Emily's family that got us through COVID, hiking and skiing, blew up in semi-spectacular fashion and is gone.

21
00:01:30,022 --> 00:01:32,819
Speaker 0: And I bought a new devil car that has four miles on it.

22
00:01:33,502 --> 00:01:38,262
Speaker 0: We have a Toyota Corolla Hybrid all-wheel drive 2023.

23
00:01:38,262 --> 00:01:40,039
Speaker 0: We bought the only one the dealership had.

24
00:01:41,943 --> 00:01:45,018
Speaker 0: And I hate buying cars, especially at dealerships.

25
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,520
Speaker 1: I don't know why you didn't do what I suggested and hire the car buying expert.

26
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:57,540
Speaker 0: I looked at that, and get this, this was actually really easy, and car buying is a lot different than it was the last time I bought a car.

27
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:02,520
Speaker 1: Because you have to understand, the last time- I've only done it one time, and I just- I've done it twice.

28
00:02:02,762 --> 00:02:04,700
Speaker 1: I did it, I probably didn't do it the best way.

29
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:11,332
Speaker 0: In the year 1996, I bought with a $3,500 check that my parents wrote for me, a laser.

30
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,200
Speaker 0: Like, that was my first car.

31
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,000
Speaker 0: You know, my parents gave me a check, I gave it to some guy who gave me this car.

32
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,840
Speaker 0: This was one of those, like, buy it from someone in their own driveway and drive it home and hope it doesn't break.

33
00:02:28,242 --> 00:02:32,360
Speaker 0: And then in 2001, I bought the Purple Sunfire that you remember and love.

34
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,596
Speaker 0: The one where one time- Who said I loved it?

35
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:43,680
Speaker 0: So, we were playing Blaze in the Dark the other night, and Alex plays with us, and I was reminded of an instant that I'm pretty sure you were there for, you and Pete.

36
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:51,060
Speaker 0: Where we drove that car somewhere, and I stopped to replace the tire, because I got a flat, and I had to put the donut on.

37
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,880
Speaker 0: We were sitting outside like a gas station.

38
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:58,080
Speaker 0: And I remember that I jacked the car up, and I put the donut on with you guys' help.

39
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,359
Speaker 0: And then when I pulled the jack down, the car didn't go down.

40
00:03:03,381 --> 00:03:08,400
Speaker 0: The shocks just stayed fully extended, and the back of the car just stayed up, like, at an angle.

41
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,600
Speaker 1: I have a memory of a car doing something like that and, like, having to sit on the car to squish the car.

42
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:20,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, I remember me and Pete got on the back of the car and kind of jumped up and down until we forced the shock back down so we could drive home.

43
00:03:20,781 --> 00:03:22,708
Speaker 0: And I never got that fixed at any point.

44
00:03:23,029 --> 00:03:26,480
Speaker 0: The shocks were still broken when we were living in Beacon.

45
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,058
Speaker 1: I mean, clearly, they're not supposed to do that.

46
00:03:28,921 --> 00:03:29,202
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

47
00:03:29,262 --> 00:03:32,780
Speaker 0: They're not supposed to do that to a degree that I understood.

48
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,860
Speaker 1: I mean, in some cars, they do that on purpose, right?

49
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:36,934
Speaker 1: It's a lowrider, right?

50
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,220
Speaker 1: I guess, on some level.

51
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,640
Speaker 1: It's not supposed to do that by accident.

52
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:45,480
Speaker 0: When we were in college, I understood that that was not supposed to happen, but what was I going to do?

53
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,173
Speaker 0: It's not like I could afford to fix anything in that car.

54
00:03:48,193 --> 00:03:49,440
Speaker 0: I could barely afford to change the oil.

55
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:52,319
Speaker 1: Didn't afford to keep the car from getting repo'd.

56
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:52,781
Speaker 0: Yeah.

57
00:03:53,062 --> 00:03:57,860
Speaker 0: The car got repo'd, someone stole the car later, and I never knew what happened to it.

58
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,940
Speaker 0: And I just gave up on it, actually, at that point.

59
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,099
Speaker 1: I don't remember it being stolen.

60
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:02,742
Speaker 0: That was in Beacon.

61
00:04:02,762 --> 00:04:07,140
Speaker 0: When we moved out of Beacon, I parked it, actually, outside Emily's apartment.

62
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:11,180
Speaker 0: And then I couldn't come back for, like, two days because a giant blizzard happened.

63
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,507
Speaker 0: And when I came back, the car was gone.

64
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,720
Speaker 0: So I called a bunch of tow places and none of them had it.

65
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:19,595
Speaker 0: Like, I called all the impound lots I could find in the phone book.

66
00:04:19,654 --> 00:04:20,319
Speaker 0: None of them had it.

67
00:04:20,862 --> 00:04:22,897
Speaker 0: So I filed a police report, like, "Yeah, I guess my car was

68
00:04:22,937 --> 00:04:23,260
Speaker 0: stolen.".

69
00:04:23,902 --> 00:04:25,799
Speaker 0: And then I just didn't do anything because I didn't care.

70
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,859
Speaker 0: Cops never called me back.

71
00:04:29,922 --> 00:04:30,928
Speaker 0: And that car just disappeared.

72
00:04:30,948 --> 00:04:32,860
Speaker 0: To this day, I have no idea what happened to that Sunfire.

73
00:04:33,141 --> 00:04:33,879
Speaker 0: Nor do I care.

74
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:45,220
Speaker 0: If someone stole it, like, godspeed, it didn't have cooling, nor did it really have oil in it, or power steering fluid, or transmission fluid, and the brakes didn't really work that well.

75
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:57,040
Speaker 0: But buying a new car is extra special because not only have I never bought a new car, I don't think anyone in my family, my direct line, has ever bought a new car.

76
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,387
Speaker 0: Like, that is not a thing.

77
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,233
Speaker 0: I didn't.

78
00:04:59,273 --> 00:05:00,320
Speaker 0: I could never afford that.

79
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:02,899
Speaker 0: And by the time I could afford it, I didn't need or want a car.

80
00:05:04,822 --> 00:05:05,545
Speaker 0: So buying the car.

81
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:09,000
Speaker 0: to tell the short story, I go in and it's hard to get this car.

82
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:14,280
Speaker 0: Like, there aren't a lot of hybrids available for all the reasons you can read about on a real news site.

83
00:05:14,602 --> 00:05:16,698
Speaker 0: It's actually really hard to buy that kind of car right now.

84
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,779
Speaker 0: Used ones are going for, like, the same price as new ones, which is extra fucked up.

85
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,349
Speaker 0: So the car I want costs, sticker, $28,900.

86
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:26,034
Speaker 0: Like, that's the sticker price.

87
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:29,119
Speaker 1: That's not too bad.

88
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,249
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's not too bad.

89
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:35,260
Speaker 1: In the old days- You had a lot more money than I had when I bought a car, and the car I bought was $19,000.

90
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:35,351
Speaker 1: Yeah.

91
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:38,201
Speaker 1: And that was in 2006.

92
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:45,117
Speaker 0: I Google around, and basically every dealer within a reasonable trip of New York City adds $3,000 to $4,000 to that.

93
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,880
Speaker 0: They're actually selling them way above sticker because they're in such high demand.

94
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,150
Speaker 0: Like, you can't get them cheap.

95
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,220
Speaker 0: You're going to pay extra.

96
00:05:53,283 --> 00:05:57,093
Speaker 0: This dealership- Yeah, it was actually, like, that seemed reasonable.

97
00:05:57,334 --> 00:05:58,199
Speaker 0: Like, I could deal with that.

98
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,371
Speaker 0: Especially because if I finance it, like, inflation's so bad.

99
00:06:01,753 --> 00:06:02,817
Speaker 0: Yeah, loan me money.

100
00:06:02,978 --> 00:06:03,380
Speaker 0: Good luck.

101
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:07,454
Speaker 0: So, uh, the dealership's like, "Yeah, that car's worth about

102
00:06:07,454 --> 00:06:08,840
Speaker 0: $41,000.".

103
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,999
Speaker 0: And that's the price that they gave me when we went in and looked at it.

104
00:06:12,721 --> 00:06:14,857
Speaker 0: And we just played dumb, and I was like, "Yeah, okay, cool,

105
00:06:14,877 --> 00:06:15,200
Speaker 0: whatever.".

106
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:15,923
Speaker 0: And we acted like.

107
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:16,626
Speaker 0: we kind of liked the car.

108
00:06:16,646 --> 00:06:19,679
Speaker 0: Then we left and came back a few days later, said we want to buy it.

109
00:06:20,321 --> 00:06:26,200
Speaker 0: And I didn't haggle until we had filled out the financing form all the way to the bottom.

110
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:32,360
Speaker 0: Like, all that was left is to sign my name on a piece of paper, and then the process of buying this car would start.

111
00:06:32,922 --> 00:06:37,600
Speaker 0: And then I was just like, "Hey, uh, so all the other dealerships are only marking these up by, like, $3,000.

112
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,354
Speaker 0: So, uh, why does this one cost

113
00:06:40,354 --> 00:06:41,822
Speaker 0: $41,000?".

114
00:06:41,822 --> 00:06:45,660
Speaker 0: And the guy did the thing where he pretends to go talk to his manager for, like, two minutes.

115
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:49,520
Speaker 0: And he comes back, and he knocks it down to exactly what I said.

116
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:49,922
Speaker 0: And I was like,

117
00:06:50,002 --> 00:06:50,383
Speaker 0: "Okay.".

118
00:06:50,805 --> 00:06:52,693
Speaker 0: Like, we both were like, "Okay, that was the game.

119
00:06:52,753 --> 00:06:53,075
Speaker 0: The game's

120
00:06:53,175 --> 00:06:53,356
Speaker 0: over.".

121
00:06:53,396 --> 00:06:54,280
Speaker 0: And I bought the car.

122
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,108
Speaker 1: But you did financing?

123
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:08,037
Speaker 0: Uh, so I did financing because I learned that the interest rate my credit card company, like Chase, offered on their special deal was, like, 7.5%.

124
00:07:08,037 --> 00:07:08,458
Speaker 0: Fuck that.

125
00:07:10,761 --> 00:07:16,660
Speaker 0: Uh, the dealership was, like, 6%, but it's Toyota-thon.

126
00:07:17,421 --> 00:07:21,451
Speaker 0: And there's one of those deals that you're not supposed to be able to get, 3.49%, which is shockingly low.

127
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:32,460
Speaker 0: Like, I'm literally better off financing and taking the money I would have paid cash for and just putting it in the stock market for two years.

128
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,760
Speaker 1: I mean, that may be true, that they might have had a deal going on, right?

129
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:44,553
Speaker 1: But, uh, everything that I've heard suggests that, you know, you should be able to get financing elsewhere.

130
00:07:44,593 --> 00:07:48,660
Speaker 1: that's, like, basically even when there's a deal that's lower than what the car dealership offers.

131
00:07:49,623 --> 00:07:54,760
Speaker 1: And then, when you buy a car with cash from the dealer, you should get a lower price.

132
00:07:55,321 --> 00:07:56,585
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, so that's the thing I was getting at.

133
00:07:56,605 --> 00:07:57,810
Speaker 0: That was the conventional wisdom.

134
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,235
Speaker 0: That's how I've always approached cars.

135
00:07:59,676 --> 00:08:00,780
Speaker 0: That shit doesn't work anymore.

136
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:07,631
Speaker 0: I was trying to, like, talk about total price, and the guy was like, "The total price is the same no matter how you finance.

137
00:08:08,012 --> 00:08:11,258
Speaker 0: If you put no money down, if you pay in cash, the price is the price.

138
00:08:11,338 --> 00:08:12,339
Speaker 0: They don't care about that

139
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:12,680
Speaker 0: anymore.".

140
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,149
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

141
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:23,139
Speaker 0: So, uh, 3.5% is apparently insane, and I get the impression, 'cause they basically said, "Oh, yeah, your credit's literally perfect, so we got that

142
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:23,319
Speaker 0: deal.".

143
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:25,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, that's not a problem.

144
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:32,672
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I put 10 grand down, and the other thing, there is no prepayment penalty, so I could just pay the whole thing off tomorrow if I wanted.

145
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:37,900
Speaker 0: I could turn this into cash and pay, like, a couple dollars worth of interest effectively.

146
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:40,139
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, you could always do that, yeah.

147
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:43,966
Speaker 0: Uh, some, in the old days, a lot of financing wouldn't let you do that.

148
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:47,212
Speaker 0: My sunfire, if I paid it off early, I would've had to pay a penalty.

149
00:08:48,254 --> 00:08:49,596
Speaker 0: Not that I could've paid it off early.

150
00:08:49,636 --> 00:08:50,858
Speaker 0: I mean, it got repoed.

151
00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:51,680
Speaker 0: I couldn't even pay it.

152
00:08:53,221 --> 00:08:53,381
Speaker 1: Hmm.

153
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:59,334
Speaker 1: Uh, I'm gonna just add a curio- I mean, the problem is, I would go and, like, type into a website to get an auto loan quote.

154
00:08:59,374 --> 00:09:03,720
Speaker 1: The problem is, I know from having worked literally in my business- Oh, yeah, it'll do a hard check on your credit.

155
00:09:04,521 --> 00:09:05,344
Speaker 1: No, that's not the problem.

156
00:09:05,384 --> 00:09:06,027
Speaker 1: I don't care about that.

157
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:09,220
Speaker 1: The problem is, if I do that, I will start being inundated.

158
00:09:10,223 --> 00:09:11,880
Speaker 1: By people trying to sell cars.

159
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,701
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

160
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:18,148
Speaker 0: I clicked on a website, like, last week on a car, like, some random Toyota dealership.

161
00:09:18,188 --> 00:09:19,910
Speaker 0: Like, I'm interested in this one.

162
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,215
Speaker 0: Those motherfuckers would not respond to an email.

163
00:09:23,315 --> 00:09:27,280
Speaker 0: Like, they didn't email me back, except they tried to email me and they fucked it up, so I went to you.

164
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,840
Speaker 0: Uh, they just called my phone, like, five times a day for weeks.

165
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,148
Speaker 1: Yep.

166
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:37,880
Speaker 0: I just blocked the number and didn't, uh, buy the car from that dealership.

167
00:09:38,763 --> 00:09:38,986
Speaker 1: Yep.

168
00:09:39,656 --> 00:09:39,920
Speaker 1: Anyway.

169
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,620
Speaker 0: Anyway, I have a devil carriage now to replace the one that blew up, and it's pretty cool.

170
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,776
Speaker 1: Um, prob- I'm still probably not gonna buy one for- ever.

171
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:49,540
Speaker 1: I don't know.

172
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:49,740
Speaker 1: Yep.

173
00:09:49,761 --> 00:09:51,611
Speaker 0: You can still borrow mine if you ever need a car.

174
00:09:51,812 --> 00:09:53,160
Speaker 0: Just don't crash it, 'cause it's a nice one.

175
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,047
Speaker 1: I mean, last year- I mean, this year.

176
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:57,799
Speaker 1: This year's almost over, but I'm not gonna need one again this year.

177
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,532
Speaker 1: Uh, but in all of 2022, I- there were two times that I wanted a vehicle.

178
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,760
Speaker 0: Well, you tried to borrow mine that one time, and, like, you couldn't get a parking brake done.

179
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,080
Speaker 1: Right, that was one of the times- right, so one of the times that we wanted to go apple picking.

180
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:12,555
Speaker 1: Yep.

181
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:22,500
Speaker 1: And we did not- we ended up just not having the car, and there was no, like, really reasonable alternative, so we simply didn't go, and it wasn't that big a deal.

182
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,638
Speaker 1: It was disappointing, but no- you know, one day, one apple picking.

183
00:10:25,699 --> 00:10:25,900
Speaker 1: Okay.

184
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,740
Speaker 0: That happened to me three- there were three instances over the last two years.

185
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:38,900
Speaker 0: Well, after the last year, where I went to get that car at, like, 6 AM to go ski, and something on it blew up, and the trip failed, and my whole day turned into car repair shit.

186
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:39,480
Speaker 1: Yep.

187
00:10:39,581 --> 00:10:46,280
Speaker 1: And then the other- the other time was on Thanksgiving, which, out of our control, our family Thanksgiving was in New Jersey.

188
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:46,784
Speaker 0: Yep.

189
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:55,020
Speaker 1: We could have used a train to get there and back, but we got relatives to drive us there, and then we used a train to go home.

190
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,006
Speaker 0: Funnily enough, that's when the cruise blew up.

191
00:10:57,127 --> 00:11:01,120
Speaker 0: We drove to Thanksgiving, and on the way home at midnight on the GWB, it blew up.

192
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,083
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was a minor inconvenience.

193
00:11:04,143 --> 00:11:17,940
Speaker 1: We got, you know, we spent more- a slight amount of time and money in transport, right, on train tickets and whatever, but compared to the cost of car renting or buying, it's like the cost of train tickets one time.

194
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:27,140
Speaker 0: I did calculate, because we do, like, since COVID started, we ski pretty much every weekend in the winter, and we hike, like, a lot of weekends in the spring and fall.

195
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,707
Speaker 1: Just don't do that.

196
00:11:29,352 --> 00:11:30,440
Speaker 1: You could save a lot of money.

197
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,539
Speaker 0: Those are our primary hobbies, like biking, skiing, running, hiking.

198
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,247
Speaker 1: You don't need the car for biking.

199
00:11:36,267 --> 00:11:38,900
Speaker 1: It's literally the opposite of car.

200
00:11:39,582 --> 00:11:46,399
Speaker 0: Yeah, we actually, we don't, we only use, we only took, the only time we ever took the bikes anywhere in the car was taking them to Wildwood.

201
00:11:49,821 --> 00:11:54,640
Speaker 0: But it ends up being cheaper to own this car, for us, for that profile.

202
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:06,740
Speaker 1: I mean, if you, right, you're basically, you know, it's like, yes, if you continue, if you insist on doing those activities, you know, owning a car to do those activities is cheaper than doing those activities some other way.

203
00:12:06,861 --> 00:12:10,220
Speaker 1: But what's even cheaper is not doing those things.

204
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, but those things are great.

205
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:13,217
Speaker 1: Anyway.

206
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:22,600
Speaker 0: Of course, the car costs, I mean, considering how much we're spending to fly to Colorado to ski in January, the car is actually, it rounds down significantly.

207
00:12:23,683 --> 00:12:24,980
Speaker 1: You could just not do that either.

208
00:12:26,741 --> 00:12:32,840
Speaker 0: So, in the news, I got a little bit of a geek bite, because I've watched the show, at least the first season of it with Emily.

209
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:34,819
Speaker 0: We might do a little special and talk about it.

210
00:12:35,303 --> 00:12:37,020
Speaker 0: The Ted Lasso Show, which.

211
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,260
Speaker 1: That's the, that's the, that's the, oh, basically, what I know about this show.

212
00:12:40,341 --> 00:12:41,378
Speaker 0: I don't see what you know about it.

213
00:12:42,121 --> 00:12:46,180
Speaker 1: It's basically the only thing on Apple TV Plus that really anyone cares about.

214
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,179
Speaker 0: That is true, it is literally the only thing on Apple TV that anyone gets a shit about.

215
00:12:50,560 --> 00:13:03,900
Speaker 1: People get Apple TV Plus just to watch this one show, right, so it must be, you know, have some sort of, you know, goodness to make people, right, you know, at least it's got enough hype to make people go out and get Apple TV Plus just to watch one damn TV show, right?

216
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:12,900
Speaker 1: And then it's about, so basically it's some soccer coach who doesn't know what the fuck he's doing and it's silly or heartwarming in some way, the end.

217
00:13:13,421 --> 00:13:14,424
Speaker 0: So, you're close.

218
00:13:14,745 --> 00:13:16,591
Speaker 0: That's like the surface detail.

219
00:13:16,992 --> 00:13:19,420
Speaker 0: And even watching the first episode, it kind of felt like that.

220
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,360
Speaker 0: The full, what the show is actually about is there's a Premier League club and like the owner.

221
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,840
Speaker 1: So it's like, it's a Premier League, it's like the top of English soccer.

222
00:13:29,362 --> 00:13:33,780
Speaker 0: It's a Premier League club, like it's set there, it's realistic and serious.

223
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:41,520
Speaker 0: The owner like has an acrimonious fucked up divorce and his wife, who he cheated on, ends up owning the club.

224
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:51,020
Speaker 0: So she tries to pull a producer's and destroy this club, get them relegated down to the bottom, like just burn everything.

225
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, they could be relegated, yeah.

226
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,568
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that's her plan.

227
00:13:54,628 --> 00:13:56,777
Speaker 0: So she hires basically like...

228
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,767
Speaker 1: Why would that be your plan though?

229
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:01,380
Speaker 1: If you own the club, you're just going to lose money doing that.

230
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:10,600
Speaker 0: She's raised separately, so she just wants to spite her husband because the one thing you know about her husband when the show starts is he loved that club more than anything on earth.

231
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:14,019
Speaker 0: That is all he cared about was that club and cheating on her.

232
00:14:14,966 --> 00:14:15,217
Speaker 1: Okay.

233
00:14:15,941 --> 00:14:28,340
Speaker 0: And she basically hires effectively like a high school/college level American coach of sports who literally does not know anything about soccer.

234
00:14:29,841 --> 00:14:35,180
Speaker 0: And hires him and puts him in charge of this, like he doesn't know how soccer works really, like he doesn't know the rules.

235
00:14:35,701 --> 00:14:36,425
Speaker 0: Dude doesn't know.

236
00:14:36,485 --> 00:14:39,000
Speaker 0: relegation is a thing until about halfway through the season.

237
00:14:40,341 --> 00:14:44,255
Speaker 0: There's a great scene later in the show where they explain it to him and they're like, "What?

238
00:14:44,476 --> 00:14:45,279
Speaker 0: You don't have that in the

239
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:45,640
Speaker 0: US?".

240
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,607
Speaker 0: And he's like, "God no!

241
00:14:48,189 --> 00:14:49,935
Speaker 0: What the fuck is this all about?

242
00:14:50,096 --> 00:14:50,317
Speaker 0: Get

243
00:14:50,337 --> 00:14:50,538
Speaker 0: demoted?".

244
00:14:51,421 --> 00:14:55,854
Speaker 1: No matter how much the Detroit Lions suck, they will always be in the NFL.

245
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:57,840
Speaker 1: They won't be sent down to some other league.

246
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,899
Speaker 0: But then they float around because they're like, "What does shitty teams in the US

247
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:01,020
Speaker 0: do?".

248
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:09,619
Speaker 0: And he's like, "Well actually, depending on the sport, they pretty much tank and play badly on purpose hoping that they'll get better players for the next

249
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:09,940
Speaker 0: season.".

250
00:15:10,361 --> 00:15:18,239
Speaker 1: Oh, so the trailer gave me the impression that the Ted Lasso coach guy was sort of like a dumb and dumber idiot.

251
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:18,802
Speaker 0: No!

252
00:15:18,923 --> 00:15:19,891
Speaker 0: That is the lie.

253
00:15:19,931 --> 00:15:21,040
Speaker 0: That is not what the show is about.

254
00:15:21,261 --> 00:15:24,473
Speaker 1: So he's actually, he has a common sense.

255
00:15:24,513 --> 00:15:26,320
Speaker 1: He just doesn't know anything about soccer because he's American.

256
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,991
Speaker 0: So, is that he is a fantastic coach of sports players.

257
00:15:32,334 --> 00:15:34,880
Speaker 0: He just happens to have never coached soccer before.

258
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,355
Speaker 1: Oh, so he's just out of his element.

259
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:37,960
Speaker 1: He's not an idiot.

260
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,240
Speaker 1: Yeah.

261
00:15:38,501 --> 00:15:49,660
Speaker 0: In fact, I will say having watched the entire first season, the way the show really goes is that he is a fantastic coach and nobody believes in him and he's actively being sabotaged.

262
00:15:50,061 --> 00:15:53,460
Speaker 0: But over time, he actually does make a difference and make the team better.

263
00:15:54,581 --> 00:16:01,319
Speaker 1: So it's almost like a one-punch man where everyone looks at him and it's like, "Who's this bald moron guy who's weak and not

264
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:01,760
Speaker 1: powerful?".

265
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,300
Speaker 1: But actually, he's the strongest one.

266
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:12,140
Speaker 0: And if I had to say what he's like as a character, take Ned Flanders and cross him 50/50 with our friend Chase Gordon.

267
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:13,600
Speaker 1: Okay.

268
00:16:14,061 --> 00:16:17,028
Speaker 0: I am literally, that is exactly who this character is.

269
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:18,391
Speaker 0: The show is fantastic.

270
00:16:18,452 --> 00:16:21,920
Speaker 0: It made me cry about a fake soccer game.

271
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,793
Speaker 0: Like, actually cry at the end of the first season because it starts out silly.

272
00:16:26,813 --> 00:16:29,160
Speaker 0: The characters almost seem like caricatures.

273
00:16:30,561 --> 00:16:34,308
Speaker 0: The first few episodes feel like Disney kids special.

274
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:40,480
Speaker 0: Like, imagine the Mighty Ducks, but if it wasn't the story of a piece of shit learning to be good in the course of coaching the team.

275
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,059
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what the trailer seems like.

276
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:49,260
Speaker 0: Imagine if it was a guy who is the best guy making everyone else around him better over the course of the movie.

277
00:16:51,100 --> 00:17:04,560
Speaker 0: But where it tricks you is as the show goes on, one by one, all the characters get more complex and more human until the show is a very serious, very heartfelt, very well-written drama.

278
00:17:05,161 --> 00:17:13,660
Speaker 0: And if you watch, I'm not saying you should watch it, I think you'd like it, I don't know if you'd like it, I bet you would get a little choked up in the last episode of season one.

279
00:17:14,181 --> 00:17:24,499
Speaker 0: I would bet a token amount that that would happen if you watch this show and it sneaks up on you just like Ted Lasso, the character, sneaks up on the characters in the show.

280
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:28,303
Speaker 0: It also gets soccer really right.

281
00:17:28,945 --> 00:17:37,700
Speaker 0: Like, there's a moment where whenever they talk about the game or do strategy, it's really accurate and really right, like in a really good way.

282
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:46,560
Speaker 0: It treats soccer seriously, which is, that would have been a deal breaker if the soccer was fakie, but no, the soccer is like hyper-realistic and that helps.

283
00:17:48,762 --> 00:17:53,757
Speaker 1: Alright, so the news that nobody could escape this week is we have achieved Fusion.

284
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, we have beaten Unity.

285
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,620
Speaker 1: We've achieved Fusion before, this isn't the first Fusion.

286
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:10,400
Speaker 0: We have achieved Fusion that generated definitely more power output than the power input in a very controlled short experiment.

287
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:13,203
Speaker 1: Well, it depends on your interpretation, right?

288
00:18:13,283 --> 00:18:29,160
Speaker 1: So the energy, basically the way the Fusion, the simplest explanation of how the Fusion machine is set up is that there is some target made of some material and there are lasers and the lasers fire at the target simultaneously.

289
00:18:31,182 --> 00:18:41,320
Speaker 1: And the lasers apply enough energy, pressure, heat, whatever to the target so that atoms fuse together into bigger atoms, right?

290
00:18:41,801 --> 00:18:45,528
Speaker 1: And then energy is released just like in a star, right?

291
00:18:45,588 --> 00:18:49,976
Speaker 1: Where, you know, hydrogens combine into heliums and energy is released, right?

292
00:18:50,036 --> 00:18:51,820
Speaker 1: Enough to warm a solar system.

293
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,280
Speaker 0: Not just hydrogens and heliums, they all keep combining and they make denser and denser elements as time goes on.

294
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,009
Speaker 1: Right, but it's the opposite of Fission like a nuclear weapon, right?

295
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:03,554
Speaker 1: Where you break the atoms apart and the energy comes out, right?

296
00:19:03,574 --> 00:19:04,597
Speaker 0: It's the opposite.

297
00:19:04,617 --> 00:19:05,900
Speaker 1: But energy still comes out.

298
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,580
Speaker 0: I would also point out that all modern nuclear weapons are Fusion and Fusion is just a baby step before the Fusion.

299
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:17,927
Speaker 1: The point is that usually when we've tried this before, right?

300
00:19:18,668 --> 00:19:21,812
Speaker 1: The energy that you need to put into the lasers, right?

301
00:19:21,852 --> 00:19:28,500
Speaker 1: That's the energy input that we're measuring is how much, you know, basically you plug the laser into the wall with your kilowatt, right?

302
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:31,600
Speaker 1: And you see how much energy the laser needs.

303
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:39,656
Speaker 0: But what we're not measuring for practical reasons yet is the rest of the setup, like the whole facility that makes this happen.

304
00:19:39,676 --> 00:19:41,500
Speaker 0: that uses energy is not part of this equation.

305
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:42,781
Speaker 1: Exactly.

306
00:19:42,821 --> 00:19:45,765
Speaker 1: There's all kinds of other energy that had to go into this, right?

307
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:55,660
Speaker 1: It's like someone had to physically put the target there and line everything up and monitor it and measure it and the lights for the people to see what the fuck is going on.

308
00:19:56,742 --> 00:20:08,720
Speaker 1: The heating and cooling for the people who are working there, like there's so much other energy, the energy to go into manufacturing all the equipment and it's like a lot of energy went into it that's not being measured, right?

309
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:08,840
Speaker 0: Yep.

310
00:20:10,082 --> 00:20:20,817
Speaker 0: But the lasers put about two megajoules of energy into this experiment and about three megajoules of energy were released by the Fusion.

311
00:20:20,858 --> 00:20:22,580
Speaker 0: that happened because of those lasers.

312
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,644
Speaker 0: Which, that is why this is big news.

313
00:20:24,665 --> 00:20:29,315
Speaker 0: They call this ignition in that this was a proof of concept.

314
00:20:29,675 --> 00:20:31,780
Speaker 0: that was the next milestone.

315
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:41,280
Speaker 0: Everything we've ever done researching Fusion was basically trying to achieve this as the milestone that leads us to the next milestones.

316
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:46,546
Speaker 1: So to give you sort of a, I guess a ruler, right?

317
00:20:46,566 --> 00:20:47,747
Speaker 1: A measuring stick, right?

318
00:20:48,068 --> 00:20:51,071
Speaker 1: Two megajoules doesn't mean much to most people, right?

319
00:20:51,512 --> 00:20:56,297
Speaker 1: Two megajoules is basically like eating 500 calories of food.

320
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,460
Speaker 1: So like a candy bar, maybe?

321
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,420
Speaker 0: Four slices of white bread, give or take?

322
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:01,881
Speaker 1: Yeah.

323
00:21:02,281 --> 00:21:02,942
Speaker 1: Something like that.

324
00:21:02,982 --> 00:21:10,252
Speaker 1: So imagine setting a candy bar on fire and all the energy that comes out of the candy bar, it's just a pile of carbon is left, right?

325
00:21:10,272 --> 00:21:10,613
Speaker 1: Whatever.

326
00:21:10,633 --> 00:21:15,680
Speaker 1: And then suddenly there's like an extra half a candy bar.

327
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:16,261
Speaker 1: Yep.

328
00:21:16,521 --> 00:21:21,880
Speaker 0: Take two Snickers bars, mash them up in your hand, reform it, you get two and a half candy bars.

329
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,082
Speaker 1: Right.

330
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:25,131
Speaker 1: At least energy wise, you lose.

331
00:21:25,412 --> 00:21:27,220
Speaker 1: the matter is, you know.

332
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,762
Speaker 0: Matter is just energy.

333
00:21:28,802 --> 00:21:30,004
Speaker 1: Well, I guess there is going to be.

334
00:21:30,024 --> 00:21:34,832
Speaker 1: the fused matter is now combined in some other element now, right?

335
00:21:34,892 --> 00:21:35,673
Speaker 1: You have that left.

336
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:36,955
Speaker 1: That's your byproduct, right?

337
00:21:36,975 --> 00:21:40,100
Speaker 1: You start with some smaller atoms and you end up with bigger ones.

338
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,900
Speaker 0: Imagine a distant future where we're just having fission and fusion back and forth, oscillating, generating energy.

339
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:51,840
Speaker 1: Maybe, but that sounds a lot like it's going to break the laws of physics, right?

340
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,985
Speaker 0: Well, that means there's entropy.

341
00:21:53,326 --> 00:21:54,632
Speaker 0: There is always entropy.

342
00:21:54,652 --> 00:21:55,435
Speaker 0: Do not get me wrong.

343
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,004
Speaker 1: The point is you could conceivably, right?

344
00:22:00,064 --> 00:22:04,991
Speaker 1: Depending on what targets we have and what lasers we have, because basically that's what the experiment is now, right?

345
00:22:05,011 --> 00:22:10,560
Speaker 1: Is basically keep altering the targets and altering the lasers until you get even better, right?

346
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:18,776
Speaker 1: Because mathematically, to make a power plant out of using this method, you're going to need to get a way better target, right?

347
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,900
Speaker 1: A target that can withstand a lot more.

348
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,157
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, this method is not going to be how we generate usable power with fusion.

349
00:22:25,197 --> 00:22:25,960
Speaker 0: This is how we figure it out.

350
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:31,567
Speaker 1: You also have to realize at the lab where they do this, the lab is operating 24/7.

351
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:37,293
Speaker 1: They can recharge and fire the lasers about like every four to six, eight hours.

352
00:22:37,354 --> 00:22:39,556
Speaker 1: There's like some hours long interval.

353
00:22:39,576 --> 00:22:42,820
Speaker 1: Like they can only make an attempt like three, four times a day.

354
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,711
Speaker 0: Yeah, like in a mech, you fire those PPCs.

355
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:46,160
Speaker 0: You can't just fire them again immediately.

356
00:22:46,761 --> 00:22:46,941
Speaker 1: Right.

357
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:57,352
Speaker 1: Mathematically for a power plant using this technology to function, they need to advance this to the point where the lasers fire like 10 times a second, right?

358
00:22:57,673 --> 00:22:59,275
Speaker 1: We're like going pew, pew, pew, pew, pew and just keep.

359
00:22:59,395 --> 00:23:04,160
Speaker 1: basically, you know, think of it as like button mashing and squeezing out energy, right?

360
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:11,045
Speaker 0: So there's a gain factor, which is the line, because basically they have for the first time gotten the gain factor above one.

361
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:15,588
Speaker 0: And this experiment achieved about 1.5 gain factor.

362
00:23:16,448 --> 00:23:26,295
Speaker 0: According to this Vox article, which has real citations to generate enough energy to be usable, not counting all the logistics of that, just the like the rate of return.

363
00:23:26,735 --> 00:23:29,877
Speaker 0: We need the gain factor to approach 100.

364
00:23:29,877 --> 00:23:33,960
Speaker 0: So we got to get three orders of magnitude ish.

365
00:23:34,401 --> 00:23:36,566
Speaker 0: Like we got to really move further.

366
00:23:36,626 --> 00:23:40,695
Speaker 0: This is this is the equivalent of, hey, we proved that we can make a rocket.

367
00:23:41,136 --> 00:23:42,840
Speaker 0: Now let's try to go for the moon someday.

368
00:23:44,941 --> 00:23:45,061
Speaker 1: Yep.

369
00:23:45,221 --> 00:23:51,592
Speaker 1: You know, the thing that still concerns me, it's like is, you know, obviously this isn't really very dangerous at all.

370
00:23:51,712 --> 00:23:51,952
Speaker 1: Right.

371
00:23:51,992 --> 00:23:54,737
Speaker 1: Just shooting a very small object with some lasers.

372
00:23:54,937 --> 00:23:55,138
Speaker 1: Right.

373
00:23:55,398 --> 00:23:56,340
Speaker 1: Once every eight hours.

374
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:56,580
Speaker 1: Right.

375
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:04,609
Speaker 1: But, you know, if you have an actual fusion power plant, you know, it's like you're basically making a star kind of.

376
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:05,410
Speaker 1: Right.

377
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:14,060
Speaker 0: Stars are by some definitions of stable, extremely stable, and by some definitions of predictable, extremely predictable.

378
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,061
Speaker 1: Yeah.

379
00:24:15,221 --> 00:24:15,762
Speaker 1: But it's like.

380
00:24:16,303 --> 00:24:22,174
Speaker 1: I just feel like, you know, if you're making a star, it's like, you know, imagine if, you know, 2001 was 2010 or 2001, where Jupiter became a star or whatever.

381
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:31,049
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, even that is going to have some negative consequences for Earth.

382
00:24:31,109 --> 00:24:33,673
Speaker 1: And that's pretty far away, at least somewhat far away.

383
00:24:34,034 --> 00:24:35,576
Speaker 1: Really close, cosmically speaking.

384
00:24:35,636 --> 00:24:37,820
Speaker 1: But it's still over there.

385
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:46,090
Speaker 1: I think that's a kind of concern in the sense that making a star on the Earth, it's sort of like, hey, when I set off the fireworks, like you run away from them.

386
00:24:46,371 --> 00:24:51,176
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, it's like you're going to make it if we're going to make a sun.

387
00:24:51,196 --> 00:24:53,880
Speaker 1: I feel like we should sort of run away from it.

388
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:56,823
Speaker 0: On the Earth, the dumbest

389
00:24:56,843 --> 00:24:57,463
Speaker 1: thing, like a bad

390
00:24:57,564 --> 00:25:13,840
Speaker 0: spot, the dumbest thing any human ever invented, other than the former guys, NFTs, is the Davy Crockett, which was the man per single person launched nuclear artillery that you basically if you fired it, there's no way you would be outside of its radius.

391
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:15,441
Speaker 0: Yeah.

392
00:25:15,661 --> 00:25:27,754
Speaker 0: But I would say, you know, while that is true, like that concern, really, that is the concern of any power generation system, because to generate a lot of power, you have generated a lot of power.

393
00:25:28,095 --> 00:25:31,839
Speaker 0: Just like if you have a really good battery, that battery is a grenade.

394
00:25:31,899 --> 00:25:32,940
Speaker 0: That battery is full of it.

395
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:36,725
Speaker 1: There's going to be something that is releasing energy.

396
00:25:37,025 --> 00:25:37,386
Speaker 1: Right.

397
00:25:37,686 --> 00:25:44,996
Speaker 1: You know, it's like if you have a megawatt power plant, well, there's some megawatt of energy in there that is in some form.

398
00:25:45,036 --> 00:25:48,100
Speaker 1: It could be electrical or it could be gravity.

399
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,785
Speaker 0: What if we build a Dyson ring?

400
00:25:49,886 --> 00:25:50,388
Speaker 0: Guess what?

401
00:25:50,428 --> 00:25:53,320
Speaker 0: Now we now we have death rays sending energy back to the Earth.

402
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:53,601
Speaker 0: Like.

403
00:25:53,641 --> 00:26:01,997
Speaker 1: that could be water that's moving so fast that it has, you know, a megawatt of like, you know, if you get hit by that water, it's going to hurt.

404
00:26:02,077 --> 00:26:02,498
Speaker 1: Right.

405
00:26:02,578 --> 00:26:03,520
Speaker 1: You know, it's dangerous.

406
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:10,694
Speaker 1: Whatever form the energy takes, kinetic or otherwise, it's if it's a large amount and if you touch it, it's going to hurt.

407
00:26:10,854 --> 00:26:11,095
Speaker 1: Right.

408
00:26:11,135 --> 00:26:13,560
Speaker 1: You have to contain it and control it and stay away from it.

409
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:32,500
Speaker 0: I guess when it comes to generating power, the thing that a lot of people who are anti nuclear power or just have weird or bad opinions about power generation, they always look at one way to generate power and consider it in a vacuum instead of considering it compared to all the other ways we have to generate power because none of them are good.

410
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:37,247
Speaker 0: None of them are like other than wind power, which isn't 100 percent either.

411
00:26:37,287 --> 00:26:39,951
Speaker 0: Like nothing is without problems.

412
00:26:40,752 --> 00:26:46,020
Speaker 0: And it's just a matter of which problems are we willing to accept by which ones are necessary.

413
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,202
Speaker 0: It's a balancing act.

414
00:26:47,242 --> 00:26:54,114
Speaker 0: And probably for at least the next thousand years, humans are going to generate power via a lot of different mechanisms.

415
00:26:54,194 --> 00:26:57,500
Speaker 0: because we don't really have there's no answer to this question.

416
00:26:58,841 --> 00:27:01,686
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, I think the way I think about it is this.

417
00:27:01,926 --> 00:27:02,788
Speaker 1: You're a human being.

418
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:03,208
Speaker 1: Right.

419
00:27:03,228 --> 00:27:06,815
Speaker 1: It's like you need to power your body usually with food.

420
00:27:07,075 --> 00:27:07,316
Speaker 1: Right.

421
00:27:07,436 --> 00:27:09,680
Speaker 0: But food comes directly from the sun.

422
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,784
Speaker 0: It just passes through a few hands along the way.

423
00:27:11,804 --> 00:27:13,187
Speaker 1: The point is, is I don't see.

424
00:27:13,207 --> 00:27:18,199
Speaker 1: I mean, there are some people, but most people are not just eating one food.

425
00:27:18,479 --> 00:27:18,680
Speaker 1: Right.

426
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,343
Speaker 1: You need to eat a bunch of different foods.

427
00:27:20,443 --> 00:27:30,700
Speaker 0: Also, I want to point out how many people who do eat just one food in the Soil and Fail Reddit are posting about things that are obviously the symptoms of malnutrition.

428
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,401
Speaker 1: Yeah.

429
00:27:32,441 --> 00:27:40,193
Speaker 1: But if our society needs energy to function in our industrialized society, at least right.

430
00:27:40,814 --> 00:27:44,599
Speaker 1: We can't really be getting it all just from one thing.

431
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,040
Speaker 1: Right.

432
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,503
Speaker 1: We got these different places.

433
00:27:46,543 --> 00:27:47,585
Speaker 1: There's different needs.

434
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:47,925
Speaker 1: There's it.

435
00:27:47,986 --> 00:27:48,166
Speaker 1: Right.

436
00:27:48,186 --> 00:27:55,300
Speaker 1: They've got a lot of we got to no matter how many ways we even if we greenify all of our energy on Earth.

437
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:55,500
Speaker 1: Right.

438
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:59,967
Speaker 1: And only use stop burning dead dinosaur fuels or whatever.

439
00:28:00,629 --> 00:28:02,532
Speaker 1: We're going to have to use more than one kind.

440
00:28:02,552 --> 00:28:04,796
Speaker 1: A little wind there, a little water there.

441
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:06,198
Speaker 1: I don't know what.

442
00:28:06,238 --> 00:28:07,260
Speaker 1: whatever we come up with.

443
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:15,775
Speaker 0: We will definitely need traditional nuclear power, just better, more modern reactors for hundreds of years at minimum.

444
00:28:16,577 --> 00:28:18,260
Speaker 1: Anyway, that's the news.

445
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,682
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's a huge news.

446
00:28:19,723 --> 00:28:21,105
Speaker 0: It's actually a big news.

447
00:28:21,847 --> 00:28:28,780
Speaker 0: It's probably one of the most important like energy scientific developments in the modern era.

448
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:29,642
Speaker 1: Yeah.

449
00:28:29,682 --> 00:28:35,032
Speaker 1: I mean, how much time was there between like, you know, Thomas Edison has a light bulb and everyone has a light bulb.

450
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,295
Speaker 0: Yeah.

451
00:28:36,555 --> 00:28:38,820
Speaker 1: It's like we've reached the first part.

452
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,683
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

453
00:28:48,803 --> 00:28:51,806
Speaker 0: So I was a mountain biker.

454
00:28:51,826 --> 00:29:04,840
Speaker 0: I am most no longer a mountain biker, but I don't know a lot about modern mountain bikes, but I know a comparative a lot relative to modern bikes about 90s era mountain bikes because that's what I mountain bike the most.

455
00:29:05,541 --> 00:29:08,986
Speaker 0: And while I had heard of this kind of thing, I never really seen it.

456
00:29:09,346 --> 00:29:12,190
Speaker 1: I didn't know it was seen or heard of it before just now.

457
00:29:12,591 --> 00:29:19,460
Speaker 0: But what this is, if you see, if you look at the picture of my thing of the day, you will see a bike that looks like a joke.

458
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:23,387
Speaker 0: This looks like the kind of bike that some weird YouTube channel will make.

459
00:29:23,627 --> 00:29:26,492
Speaker 0: Like, ah, we made a bike out of land.

460
00:29:26,552 --> 00:29:27,294
Speaker 0: How does it ride?

461
00:29:27,394 --> 00:29:28,075
Speaker 0: Terribly.

462
00:29:28,095 --> 00:29:28,736
Speaker 0: Haha.

463
00:29:29,097 --> 00:29:29,979
Speaker 0: Square wheeled bike.

464
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:30,720
Speaker 0: Look at this shit.

465
00:29:31,401 --> 00:29:42,920
Speaker 1: But I first when I saw the image of it, I said, ah, this is like some horrible old product someone made that was super dangerous and didn't, you know, and was limited and then was taken off the market for being ridiculous.

466
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:52,273
Speaker 0: So the reason I didn't know about this bike or its deal in the 90s is because this was the most expensive, best kind of mountain bike in the world at the time.

467
00:29:52,754 --> 00:29:57,060
Speaker 0: Mountain bikes in the 80s and 90s were not like mountain bikes today.

468
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,845
Speaker 0: They were not safe.

469
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:04,895
Speaker 0: Not that modern mountain bikes are safe, but they are much safer than like what I was riding.

470
00:30:05,677 --> 00:30:07,120
Speaker 0: This was the top tier.

471
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:12,345
Speaker 0: This was like the fanciest specialist weird mountain bike that the pros would ride.

472
00:30:12,826 --> 00:30:14,688
Speaker 0: This is the slingshot.

473
00:30:15,329 --> 00:30:18,252
Speaker 0: It does not have the entire triangle.

474
00:30:18,952 --> 00:30:19,853
Speaker 0: You got to look at a picture.

475
00:30:19,893 --> 00:30:26,200
Speaker 0: It's got the rear triangle of the frame, but then the tube under your crotch goes across to the handlebars.

476
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:34,450
Speaker 0: And from there, you've got the fork that goes down to the wheel with the front suspension, that same shadow 90s front suspension that every mountain bike had back then.

477
00:30:35,331 --> 00:30:37,134
Speaker 0: And there's no other bar.

478
00:30:38,175 --> 00:30:39,577
Speaker 0: There's just a cable holding it together.

479
00:30:39,597 --> 00:30:40,558
Speaker 1: There's no bottom tube.

480
00:30:40,678 --> 00:30:42,280
Speaker 1: It's just a cable.

481
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:42,921
Speaker 0: Yep.

482
00:30:43,402 --> 00:30:45,725
Speaker 0: And as a result, the bike flexes a lot.

483
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:47,747
Speaker 0: And you might think, wouldn't it just snap?

484
00:30:48,048 --> 00:30:50,892
Speaker 0: No, you're thinking about modern bikes made out of like aluminum or carbon.

485
00:30:51,192 --> 00:30:52,674
Speaker 0: This bike's made out of steel.

486
00:30:53,255 --> 00:30:55,298
Speaker 0: So that's actually not a problem.

487
00:30:55,358 --> 00:30:56,840
Speaker 0: Steel bikes will flex just fine.

488
00:30:57,641 --> 00:30:58,902
Speaker 0: Uh, watch the video.

489
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:05,207
Speaker 0: It's only 10 minutes long and it goes into extreme detail with someone riding one in the year 2022.

490
00:31:05,207 --> 00:31:08,650
Speaker 0: They got one, they restored it and they wrote it.

491
00:31:09,251 --> 00:31:11,273
Speaker 0: And it is an amazing mountain bike.

492
00:31:11,713 --> 00:31:19,780
Speaker 0: It's actually pretty good even by modern standards because this design has shocking advantages.

493
00:31:20,301 --> 00:31:28,812
Speaker 0: The only reason we don't make bikes like this today is that we developed extremely modern suspensions that could not have been made with material science in the 90s.

494
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:32,296
Speaker 0: And we have developed like modern carbon fiber.

495
00:31:32,637 --> 00:31:34,660
Speaker 0: That is like nothing we had in the 90s.

496
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:42,765
Speaker 1: I'm surprised that, you know, with all the different bike events I've been to where people bring out all the weird bikes, I've never seen one of these.

497
00:31:42,785 --> 00:31:43,465
Speaker 0: I can tell you why.

498
00:31:43,505 --> 00:31:43,865
Speaker 0: the video.

499
00:31:43,925 --> 00:31:45,166
Speaker 0: actually I watched this video twice.

500
00:31:45,206 --> 00:31:45,727
Speaker 0: It was so good.

501
00:31:45,767 --> 00:31:50,170
Speaker 0: The reason why is that one, there's a carbon fiber part on this.

502
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:53,252
Speaker 0: And if you remember, this is from the 90s.

503
00:31:53,592 --> 00:31:55,273
Speaker 0: Yeah, that shit is dodgy.

504
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:57,775
Speaker 0: If it breaks, you got to make like a custom one.

505
00:31:58,196 --> 00:32:04,440
Speaker 0: But two, there's a critical piece that is like the flex plate that connects this thing together.

506
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,642
Speaker 0: Not the cable, but like this flex plate.

507
00:32:07,063 --> 00:32:08,544
Speaker 0: It's made out of a weird material.

508
00:32:09,205 --> 00:32:12,568
Speaker 0: It's basically irreplaceable and it degrades over time.

509
00:32:12,988 --> 00:32:24,660
Speaker 0: So you've got to like cut and scrape the old one out, acquire or make an equivalent flex plate to replace it, put it in this bike and trust it not to kill you.

510
00:32:26,261 --> 00:32:38,520
Speaker 0: So even the guy riding the bike in the video is like kind of afraid the bike's gonna hurt him the whole time because even though it was vouched for, it's kind of hard to make these bikes safe and nobody's making parts for these things.

511
00:32:39,401 --> 00:32:39,541
Speaker 1: Yep.

512
00:32:40,643 --> 00:32:41,103
Speaker 1: All right.

513
00:32:41,424 --> 00:32:53,280
Speaker 1: So thing of the day in New York City, down on Astor Place in Manhattan on the west side, west-ish, east-ish, I guess it's technically east, but whatever.

514
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,380
Speaker 0: By the big black cube.

515
00:32:55,481 --> 00:32:58,512
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's near-ish to the cube, like a block or two away from there.

516
00:32:58,733 --> 00:33:00,620
Speaker 1: In an NYU area, right?

517
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:09,749
Speaker 1: I guess it's definitely, I guess it wouldn't, even though it's not super close to the water, I guess it would still technically be East Village.

518
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:11,932
Speaker 1: Anyway, there's a haircut place.

519
00:33:11,952 --> 00:33:18,400
Speaker 1: You go down these stairs, you have to go down, like you're on the sidewalk and it says "Aster Barber" or whatever is a sign.

520
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:26,560
Speaker 1: You have to go downstairs like you're going in a basement and there's a haircutting place and that place has been there for fucking ever, right?

521
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:36,492
Speaker 1: In fact, when I first worked in New York City and we lived in Beacon, I would go get my haircut there because I had hair.

522
00:33:37,153 --> 00:33:41,600
Speaker 1: There weren't any good haircut places in the Beacon area and it was conveniently near my work.

523
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,507
Speaker 0: Yeah, back then, you know where I got my haircut?

524
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:46,679
Speaker 0: At Grand Central because it was really convenient even though it caused- I did that one time.

525
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,719
Speaker 0: It caused like four times the normal haircut place.

526
00:33:49,121 --> 00:33:50,199
Speaker 1: That place isn't there anymore.

527
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,058
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

528
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:56,789
Speaker 1: But anyway, so this place is like a really special kind of place, right?

529
00:33:56,829 --> 00:34:02,140
Speaker 1: It's like when I was a kid growing up, I would go to a barber and it was like three old guys, right?

530
00:34:02,361 --> 00:34:07,380
Speaker 1: And they had three seats and then they had one seat that was like an old metal car for the kids to sit in.

531
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:14,547
Speaker 1: And then they had a TV playing some sport or whatever.

532
00:34:15,069 --> 00:34:16,630
Speaker 1: In the city, it's usually soccer.

533
00:34:17,312 --> 00:34:23,580
Speaker 1: And then they got all those old timey seats and a bunch of old magazines like golf magazines or whatever, right?

534
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,163
Speaker 1: You know the kind of place, right?

535
00:34:25,444 --> 00:34:27,530
Speaker 1: A white guy barber shop.

536
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:30,717
Speaker 1: It's completely different from a black guy barber shop, right?

537
00:34:30,757 --> 00:34:31,520
Speaker 1: Which is even cooler.

538
00:34:32,161 --> 00:34:38,534
Speaker 1: But, you know, anyway, so this place though, it's a lot like that, right?

539
00:34:38,654 --> 00:34:41,719
Speaker 1: Except it's an everybody barber shop, right?

540
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:45,888
Speaker 1: It's like every kind of age, every kind of person, right?

541
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:47,652
Speaker 1: And it's enormous.

542
00:34:47,831 --> 00:34:51,679
Speaker 1: Like it's not just like this one straight line of chairs, like a handful of them.

543
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:58,326
Speaker 1: It's like this big giant open room with no walls other than the surrounding walls, right?

544
00:34:58,807 --> 00:35:01,890
Speaker 1: And chairs and mirrors just scattered all about, right?

545
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:12,040
Speaker 1: And it's like you feel almost like you're going into like a hotel or some shit because you don't, you know, maybe you've been going there a long time and you know who your person is, right?

546
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:16,148
Speaker 1: You know where their seat is, you know what their hours are and you can find them.

547
00:35:16,469 --> 00:35:22,100
Speaker 1: But usually you're going up to the front desk and there's a person there who's like managing, right?

548
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:26,752
Speaker 1: And they got everyone's appointments and you're like, you know, you might say, "Oh, I want to see so and

549
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:27,093
Speaker 1: so.".

550
00:35:27,314 --> 00:35:28,838
Speaker 1: And they'll be like, "Oh, they're not here right now.

551
00:35:28,878 --> 00:35:29,058
Speaker 1: They're

552
00:35:29,078 --> 00:35:29,379
Speaker 1: busy.".

553
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,119
Speaker 0: Would you be willing to accept Joey Jojo?

554
00:35:32,821 --> 00:35:33,122
Speaker 1: Right.

555
00:35:33,162 --> 00:35:41,360
Speaker 1: It's like there's so many barbers down there, you know, different hairdressers and whatever with different, you know, specialties and whatever, you know.

556
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,548
Speaker 1: But usually if you've never been there before, you just be like, "Hey, I want my

557
00:35:44,568 --> 00:35:44,990
Speaker 1: haircut.".

558
00:35:45,391 --> 00:35:48,760
Speaker 1: And they look at you and they figure out who would be good for your hair, right?

559
00:35:49,161 --> 00:35:50,584
Speaker 1: And they don't do this out loud.

560
00:35:50,664 --> 00:35:58,180
Speaker 1: Like the person at the front just looks at you and then looks at the schedule and who's available and they're like, "Go over there to number whatever," right?

561
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,747
Speaker 1: You know, and there'll be a person there to cut your hair, right?

562
00:36:01,787 --> 00:36:08,280
Speaker 1: You know, and all the bar, you know, the hairdressers, they got, you know, they really personalize out their little zone, right?

563
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,269
Speaker 1: They got, you know, photos and all kinds of shit going on, right?

564
00:36:11,951 --> 00:36:14,960
Speaker 1: So it's a really a special kind of place going on there.

565
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:23,840
Speaker 1: And mostly NYU students, but all kinds of people go in there, you know, famous people, people who don't have a lot of money, people who do have a lot of money.

566
00:36:24,502 --> 00:36:27,152
Speaker 1: Anyone in New York who needs a haircut, it's a place to go.

567
00:36:27,173 --> 00:36:29,080
Speaker 1: They don't rip you off there, right?

568
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,655
Speaker 1: And so this place during the pan doodle almost went OOB, right?

569
00:36:35,755 --> 00:36:37,460
Speaker 1: Which would have been a travesty.

570
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,320
Speaker 0: I mean, I didn't get any haircuts during the entire pan doodle.

571
00:36:41,421 --> 00:36:41,682
Speaker 1: Right.

572
00:36:41,863 --> 00:36:45,719
Speaker 1: Not people weren't getting haircuts at all, but also, you know, people weren't there.

573
00:36:45,987 --> 00:36:46,180
Speaker 1: Yeah.

574
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,908
Speaker 1: Not commuting to work, students not studenting, right?

575
00:36:48,989 --> 00:36:52,520
Speaker 1: It's like, even if you were getting a haircut, you weren't getting a haircut and asked to replace it in Manhattan.

576
00:36:55,181 --> 00:37:01,440
Speaker 1: And so that would have been real sad, but this cultural institution was saved by somebody.

577
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,000
Speaker 1: Thank you, person who saved it with your money.

578
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:04,700
Speaker 0: A sophomore.

579
00:37:05,701 --> 00:37:05,885
Speaker 1: Yep.

580
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:06,579
Speaker 1: You were great.

581
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:13,580
Speaker 1: But then now that, you know, NYU is back doing its thing, right?

582
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:19,500
Speaker 1: Times are not normal, but, you know, it's recovered somewhat economically, at least.

583
00:37:20,643 --> 00:37:26,700
Speaker 1: A student at the NYU, right, came in and they did something amazing.

584
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,143
Speaker 1: I don't know.

585
00:37:27,163 --> 00:37:28,620
Speaker 1: I know I never thought of this before.

586
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:39,960
Speaker 1: Somehow they arranged to basically, you know, at night when this place is closed, it's a big old room, right, with barber chairs, but nothing else.

587
00:37:40,682 --> 00:37:42,559
Speaker 1: Just fucking has some parties down there.

588
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:47,180
Speaker 1: And the owners is like, well, no one's cutting hair down there at that time.

589
00:37:47,644 --> 00:37:48,659
Speaker 1: It's going to make us money.

590
00:37:49,305 --> 00:37:50,719
Speaker 1: Why the fuck wouldn't we do this?

591
00:37:51,141 --> 00:37:52,918
Speaker 1: It's like the perfect place to do this.

592
00:37:54,727 --> 00:37:55,680
Speaker 1: What would be the objection?

593
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,384
Speaker 1: Nothing.

594
00:37:56,485 --> 00:37:57,499
Speaker 1: It's not like bothering anyone.

595
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,040
Speaker 1: No one lives there, right?

596
00:37:59,862 --> 00:38:00,587
Speaker 1: It's in a basement.

597
00:38:01,473 --> 00:38:02,600
Speaker 1: It's legal, right?

598
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:08,040
Speaker 1: And so sure enough, they're having parties down there now, which is pretty freaking awesome.

599
00:38:08,241 --> 00:38:12,620
Speaker 1: And the New York Times did a little, you know, I guess their one day strike is over.

600
00:38:13,908 --> 00:38:15,399
Speaker 1: So it's okay to read them for now.

601
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:19,940
Speaker 1: And they did a little piece talking about the parties going on down there.

602
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:26,440
Speaker 1: Sometimes, you know, the attendance is waxing and waning based on, you know, what day it is, right, stuff like that.

603
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,011
Speaker 1: But they're getting turned out.

604
00:38:29,072 --> 00:38:30,740
Speaker 1: They're getting big time DJs down there.

605
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,940
Speaker 1: It's like, that's pretty awesome.

606
00:38:33,881 --> 00:38:36,260
Speaker 1: Why didn't that, that should have been going on for a long time.

607
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,460
Speaker 1: Why has that only started recently?

608
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,800
Speaker 0: I love in this article the profiles of the people.

609
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:40,819
Speaker 0: Because they are.

610
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:45,760
Speaker 1: Whoever, whoever came up with this idea, genius, you're going far in life, right?

611
00:38:47,342 --> 00:38:51,000
Speaker 0: In the meta moment, the Geek Nights Book Club book, Alif the Unseen.

612
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,100
Speaker 0: It's pretty good.

613
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,880
Speaker 1: I'm making a lot of progress.

614
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:53,552
Speaker 0: I am too.

615
00:38:54,381 --> 00:38:56,639
Speaker 1: I have, I still see Alif though, so I'm not sure.

616
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,660
Speaker 0: Well, you know what, you know who doesn't see Alif, at least as far as I've gotten?

617
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:01,359
Speaker 0: The government.

618
00:39:02,721 --> 00:39:04,299
Speaker 0: The government does not see Alif yet.

619
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,900
Speaker 0: And that is- Yeah, they're definitely trying.

620
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:14,439
Speaker 0: Alif is, this book is exactly what it was described to be.

621
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:23,098
Speaker 0: Which was, "An unnamed Middle Eastern security state, a young Arab Indian hacker, protects watched groups from surveillance and tries to stay out of

622
00:39:23,158 --> 00:39:23,439
Speaker 0: trouble.".

623
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,498
Speaker 0: Yada, yada, yada, jinn.

624
00:39:28,461 --> 00:39:33,180
Speaker 1: The D-J-I-N-N genie kind, not the drinking or card game kind.

625
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:42,440
Speaker 0: What I do appreciate is, I still am convinced that the framing story is 100% going to be directly relevant to the details of what happens.

626
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:49,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, so my theory of it being a Princess Bride deal, I was wrong.

627
00:39:52,702 --> 00:39:56,600
Speaker 1: It is not a Princess Bride framing story, it is just part of the story.

628
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:57,100
Speaker 0: Yep.

629
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:02,078
Speaker 0: That's just, that old man knew some magic and- Yep.

630
00:40:02,703 --> 00:40:05,760
Speaker 0: So this is good, read it, we'll do the show in January or February at the latest.

631
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:09,899
Speaker 0: Definitely by, like, the first week of February at the rate that I'm reading it.

632
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:16,319
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm reading it, you know, every day or so-ish, and I'm 30 to 40 percent-ish done, so.

633
00:40:18,161 --> 00:40:24,840
Speaker 0: Otherwise, we will likely be at PAX East with a couple of panels, but do not expect us to be hanging out there the whole weekend.

634
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,539
Speaker 0: Still seems a little too soon for that.

635
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:40,479
Speaker 0: Also, it's a four-day con, and considering most of the people we know are still going to avoid cons and it's going to be fully masked, I can't imagine I would have a lot to do if it was just me and Scott for four full days in Boston at a PAX.

636
00:40:41,121 --> 00:40:46,000
Speaker 1: I think we could do a lot of, you know, video produce, you know, content producing stuff.

637
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,660
Speaker 0: We could, and we'll see.

638
00:40:48,141 --> 00:40:59,079
Speaker 0: It's really going to depend on what panel or panels we do and when they're scheduled, and who else is going, and what the situation is in terms of the poop chart, and then we're going to decide what to do.

639
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,115
Speaker 1: Yep.

640
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:01,738
Speaker 1: Alright, so.

641
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:01,891
Speaker 1: Yeah.

642
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:03,294
Speaker 1: Hanukkah?

643
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,739
Speaker 0: Yeah, Hanukkah!

644
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,540
Speaker 1: So, Rym probably doesn't know anything about Hanukkah.

645
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:18,300
Speaker 0: So, you know what I know about Hanukkah is, one, as a kid, like, to be really blunt, I grew up, especially in, like, middle and high school, in extremely white suburbs in Michigan, like, around Detroit.

646
00:41:19,721 --> 00:41:22,720
Speaker 0: So, there weren't a lot of Jewish people in my schools.

647
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:29,920
Speaker 0: Like, in high school, there were five or six Jewish kids, and I knew most of them, and that was it in the whole high school.

648
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:30,810
Speaker 1: Yep.

649
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:35,920
Speaker 1: So, I mean, in my high school, or me, I guess, in all of my schooling, right?

650
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:39,020
Speaker 0: I mean, my elementary school didn't have any Jewish kids because it was the Catholic school.

651
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,060
Speaker 0: You had to be Catholic or lie about it.

652
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:41,277
Speaker 1: Oh, sure.

653
00:41:42,421 --> 00:41:47,360
Speaker 1: But, you know, when I went to school, yeah, it's like, Jews were definitely a minority, right?

654
00:41:47,461 --> 00:41:50,560
Speaker 1: It was mostly, you know, white Christian peoples, right?

655
00:41:51,041 --> 00:42:00,729
Speaker 1: But, the number of Jews in the area where I grew up, and Jewish kids I grew up with percentage-wise, it was much greater than the percentage in the

656
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:01,150
Speaker 1: U.S.,

657
00:42:01,231 --> 00:42:04,040
Speaker 1: and much, much greater than the percentage in the world, right?

658
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,022
Speaker 1: In the entire, in the

659
00:42:05,162 --> 00:42:05,603
Speaker 1: U.S.,

660
00:42:06,205 --> 00:42:10,434
Speaker 1: right, about, like, two and a half percent of the U.S.

661
00:42:10,554 --> 00:42:13,300
Speaker 1: population of adults are Jews, right?

662
00:42:13,462 --> 00:42:14,399
Speaker 1: It's a really small number.

663
00:42:14,981 --> 00:42:20,092
Speaker 1: And, in terms of the world population, it's something like .2%, like, not even 1% of people are Jews, right?

664
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:28,940
Speaker 1: So, but, where I grew up, it was probably, I don't know, it might have even been 5%?

665
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:29,284
Speaker 1: Who knows?

666
00:42:29,345 --> 00:42:30,560
Speaker 1: I don't have, I can't count, right?

667
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:30,903
Speaker 0: Yeah, you had 5%.

668
00:42:30,903 --> 00:42:33,920
Speaker 0: I had 5.

669
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:41,740
Speaker 1: But, anyway, so, Hanukkah, right, it's like, when I was a kid, it was just sort of like, hey, you know, we're Jews.

670
00:42:42,103 --> 00:42:43,000
Speaker 1: They're not, right?

671
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,880
Speaker 1: They got Christmas, we got Hanukkah, right?

672
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:50,280
Speaker 1: I didn't understand, you know, the history, or really care, or anything like that.

673
00:42:50,641 --> 00:42:51,799
Speaker 1: I was like, that's just how it was.

674
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,379
Speaker 1: And I thought, I was getting a good deal.

675
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:58,340
Speaker 1: I was like, I got eight fucking days, your shitty Christmas, only one day.

676
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:04,100
Speaker 1: I was like, you know, and I was thinking, I got eight days, I'm getting eight presents.

677
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,100
Speaker 1: Sure, you know, obviously, you're not gonna get eight bomb presents, right?

678
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:13,960
Speaker 1: You're just gonna get like six, you know, six okay presents, a good present, and a great present, right?

679
00:43:14,786 --> 00:43:16,180
Speaker 1: Unless you're rich or some shit, right?

680
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,552
Speaker 1: You're not getting eight, you know, Nintendo games.

681
00:43:18,572 --> 00:43:20,000
Speaker 1: That's not happening, right?

682
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:23,740
Speaker 1: You get one Nintendo game, maybe a Lego, and then some other stuff.

683
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,040
Speaker 0: Every now and then, we'd have a blowout Christmas, but they were rare.

684
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:35,640
Speaker 0: Like, the year the Super Nintendo came out, we got the Super Nintendo, and every launch game was basically the Christmas gift.

685
00:43:35,861 --> 00:43:42,980
Speaker 0: Every single launch game, but the next Christmas after that was somewhat paltry, because that was a very expensive Christmas.

686
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:50,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, but then, it's like, the whole time, it's like, you know, I wasn't actually going over to other people's and seeing their Christmases.

687
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,120
Speaker 1: I was seeing TV Christmases, right?

688
00:43:54,283 --> 00:43:57,460
Speaker 1: I went to some kid's house, right, that lived down the street.

689
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:01,220
Speaker 1: I went over to his house, like, late on Christmas day.

690
00:44:01,341 --> 00:44:03,279
Speaker 0: There were more than eight gifts under that tree, weren't there?

691
00:44:04,203 --> 00:44:05,800
Speaker 1: And I was like, what the fuck is this bullshit?

692
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:12,480
Speaker 1: Why, how come under your tree, there is, like, a full set of Marvel Super Hero cards?

693
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,000
Speaker 1: Like, the whole fucking set, right?

694
00:44:14,161 --> 00:44:16,219
Speaker 1: When we were kids, like, there was a lot of small gifts.

695
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,980
Speaker 1: And, I was like, that, I'm like, that alone is like, is like a full present.

696
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:25,700
Speaker 1: I'm like, and you got, like, two Nintendo games under there, and you got, like, a football, and I'm like, what is this?

697
00:44:25,941 --> 00:44:27,980
Speaker 1: This is Christmas, you got one day, you got one thing.

698
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,854
Speaker 1: What the fuck is this spoiling bullshit going on?

699
00:44:32,421 --> 00:44:42,360
Speaker 0: If your parents were middle class, that tree would be absolutely stuffed to capacity underneath and spilling out into the living room with piles of gimps.

700
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:47,680
Speaker 1: If I was having Christmas, kids get one thing each, right?

701
00:44:47,841 --> 00:44:49,080
Speaker 1: One present per person.

702
00:44:49,802 --> 00:44:51,660
Speaker 1: One, right, you're one person, you get one present.

703
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:52,420
Speaker 1: That's how it works.

704
00:44:53,303 --> 00:44:55,880
Speaker 1: Santa got room in there for more than one thing per person.

705
00:44:57,681 --> 00:45:06,960
Speaker 1: Okay, but in terms of actual Hanukkah, right, for anyone out there who doesn't know the story of Hanukkah, you can read it on the internet, but I will summarize it for you, right?

706
00:45:08,762 --> 00:45:12,720
Speaker 1: The Jews, right, were in Israel, and there was the Temple, right?

707
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:25,320
Speaker 1: So, if you know the Western Wall, the Wailing Wall, where the Jews pray in Jerusalem, supposedly, that wall was merely a minor piece of a retaining wall of the Temple, right?

708
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,543
Speaker 1: The Temple, right?

709
00:45:26,563 --> 00:45:38,979
Speaker 0: The literal, giant temple where it was fucking enormous, I don't know, I can't really believe- Now, of course, the historiosity of that edge is more into a bumper sticker that says, "My other car is a

710
00:45:39,019 --> 00:45:39,340
Speaker 0: Ferrari.".

711
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:46,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, you know, can I really believe that the Temple was as big as they say it was, right?

712
00:45:47,504 --> 00:45:53,660
Speaker 1: It's like the size that they claim it to be would be like greater than like any construction, right?

713
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:59,500
Speaker 1: Greater than prayer, whatever, but anyway, they believe that, you know, that Temple was the place, right?

714
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:09,180
Speaker 1: After the Jews wandered around, right, leaving Egypt, which never happened, you know, they went to Israel, in Jerusalem, they built the Temple.

715
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,309
Speaker 1: It was actually the second Temple.

716
00:46:11,409 --> 00:46:13,600
Speaker 1: By the time of Hanukkah, it was the second Temple, right?

717
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,880
Speaker 1: The first Temple was, they built and destroyed, and then they made another one.

718
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:21,680
Speaker 1: And the Temple was, it's not like a Temple, like the one you have in your neighborhood, right?

719
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:28,760
Speaker 1: It was the Temple, which is the place where you could literally sacrifice goats and God would receive them.

720
00:46:29,342 --> 00:46:31,755
Speaker 1: And it's like, you could talk to God in that Temple.

721
00:46:31,795 --> 00:46:32,740
Speaker 1: That was the one, right?

722
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,420
Speaker 1: It's like, he wouldn't listen to you if you were in some other Temple, right?

723
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,451
Speaker 1: It's like, this was the place, right?

724
00:46:37,471 --> 00:46:39,220
Speaker 1: Like a holy, important place.

725
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:45,680
Speaker 1: Anyway, obviously, the truth of that and the truth of the Hanukkah story greatly in question.

726
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:52,339
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Archaeological Evidence section of Wikipedia on this Temple is three paragraphs long, total, so...

727
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:54,504
Speaker 1: Yeah.

728
00:46:54,725 --> 00:46:58,339
Speaker 1: Anyway, but, you know, clearly there was something there, because a piece of it is still there.

729
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:05,540
Speaker 1: And the second Temple, the story of Hanukkah, the second Temple was there, right?

730
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:11,300
Speaker 1: And, you know, the Jews, there was this Jewish tribe called the Maccabees, right?

731
00:47:11,501 --> 00:47:15,120
Speaker 1: They were sort of like, you know, warrior Jews, I guess, something like that, right?

732
00:47:15,941 --> 00:47:19,272
Speaker 1: And the Assyrians, or just Syrians, right?

733
00:47:19,613 --> 00:47:21,660
Speaker 1: You know, they were warring in those times.

734
00:47:22,682 --> 00:47:24,600
Speaker 1: And, you know, the Jews are resisting.

735
00:47:27,021 --> 00:47:33,360
Speaker 1: And the story goes, right, that, you know, in the Temple, they wanted to keep the lights on, right?

736
00:47:33,641 --> 00:47:35,618
Speaker 1: They didn't have enough oil to keep the lights on.

737
00:47:36,722 --> 00:47:45,040
Speaker 1: And somehow, miraculously, the oil that should have lasted, like, not long at all, lasted for eight days, right?

738
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,059
Speaker 1: In some sort of miracle that clearly didn't happen.

739
00:47:49,443 --> 00:47:51,597
Speaker 1: And the Jews won, right, in the war.

740
00:47:52,942 --> 00:47:55,640
Speaker 1: And so that's the story of Hanukkah, right?

741
00:47:56,060 --> 00:48:01,140
Speaker 1: The reality is, is that in terms of Jewish holidays, Hanukkah doesn't rank, right?

742
00:48:01,681 --> 00:48:08,280
Speaker 1: It's like, it is not, like, the actual Jewish holidays that are, like, serious, right?

743
00:48:09,021 --> 00:48:11,456
Speaker 1: Are like, you know, Rosh Hashanah, Rosh Hashanah.

744
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:13,888
Speaker 1: I always say Rosh Hashanah.

745
00:48:14,028 --> 00:48:15,880
Speaker 1: I guess I can tell this, you know why I say Rosh Hashanah?

746
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,104
Speaker 0: Yeah, we've talked about this at length.

747
00:48:18,124 --> 00:48:23,078
Speaker 0: The problem is, I say it that way because of you, because we find it funny, just like you mispronounce "sod-er".

748
00:48:23,962 --> 00:48:25,580
Speaker 1: Well, do you know why I mispronounce it, though?

749
00:48:26,845 --> 00:48:28,340
Speaker 0: Oh, you know, I don't actually remember.

750
00:48:29,084 --> 00:48:32,059
Speaker 1: So the reason I mispronounce "sold-er", right, is because...

751
00:48:32,401 --> 00:48:35,820
Speaker 0: Oh, because you learned to "sod-er" from that guy who said it that way.

752
00:48:36,001 --> 00:48:37,439
Speaker 1: From an Australian guy, right?

753
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:54,120
Speaker 1: But, so when I was in high school in the Jewish youth group, one of the youth group people had his brother, I think, right, or father, someone, was a Vietnam veteran who was a Jew who came to tell us, you know, about, you know, the old, the Vietnam times.

754
00:48:55,024 --> 00:48:56,840
Speaker 1: He had his shit together, mostly, right?

755
00:48:57,422 --> 00:49:03,000
Speaker 1: His body wasn't in great shape, but his mind was, you know, pretty good considering the circumstances, right?

756
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,820
Speaker 1: You know, he went to Vietnam and his goal was to live and come back, right?

757
00:49:07,181 --> 00:49:10,560
Speaker 1: And that's how he, he was in charge of his little platoon or whatever.

758
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:17,400
Speaker 1: And that's what, you know, when he had like, you know, gung-ho guys who wanted to, you know, kill them all, he kicked those people out, right?

759
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,685
Speaker 1: So he was, that's, I think that's how he made it through.

760
00:49:19,725 --> 00:49:26,060
Speaker 1: But anyway, he was a Jew and he got leave, you know, legitimately for Rosh Hashanah, right?

761
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:38,040
Speaker 1: And he told us that when he was, you know, walking around on leave, some MPs approached him and were like, "Hey, you know, you're supposed to, you know, you're really on leave, show us your papers," right?

762
00:49:38,461 --> 00:49:40,731
Speaker 1: So he showed him the papers, which were legitimate papers.

763
00:49:40,771 --> 00:49:42,760
Speaker 1: that said he's on leave for Rosh Hashanah.

764
00:49:43,483 --> 00:49:44,771
Speaker 0: Oh, you did, I remember this.

765
00:49:44,852 --> 00:49:46,040
Speaker 0: You did tell me this story.

766
00:49:46,301 --> 00:49:49,153
Speaker 1: And the MP is like, "What's this Rosh Hashanah

767
00:49:49,173 --> 00:49:49,494
Speaker 1: business?".

768
00:49:52,001 --> 00:49:55,515
Speaker 1: And so that's why I always say Rosh Hashanah, even though it's Rosh Hashanah.

769
00:49:56,438 --> 00:49:56,900
Speaker 1: So anyway.

770
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:03,080
Speaker 0: I did say Chipotle at work last week because I ended up eating, I ate at Chipotle.

771
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:11,040
Speaker 1: And someone just straight up literally next to, you work literally next to Los Tacos Numero Uno and you went to Chipotle?

772
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:12,990
Speaker 0: I was on the other side of town doing something.

773
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,920
Speaker 0: I was not, believe me, believe me.

774
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,457
Speaker 1: I haven't eaten at a Chipotle in years.

775
00:50:16,538 --> 00:50:16,740
Speaker 1: Anyway.

776
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:17,924
Speaker 0: I was up at the other office.

777
00:50:17,964 --> 00:50:22,539
Speaker 0: If I was at the 120 Park office, I would have been at Los Tacos Numero Uno.

778
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:27,470
Speaker 1: Rosh Hashanah, correctly pronounced Rosh Hashanah, is like top holiday.

779
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:31,460
Speaker 1: Yom Kippur also top like in terms of seriousness, Passover, right?

780
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:37,480
Speaker 1: And some Jews will perhaps accurately tell you the most important Jewish holiday is Shabbos every week, right?

781
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:43,640
Speaker 1: You know, every Friday night through, you know, Saturday night is like the actual, the most important Jewish holiday.

782
00:50:43,962 --> 00:50:45,875
Speaker 1: Hanukkah doesn't rank in Jewish holidays.

783
00:50:45,895 --> 00:50:46,660
Speaker 1: It's not that important.

784
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:56,860
Speaker 0: But it happened to be around the same time as the dominant white Christian holiday that completely overpowers all American pop culture every year around that time.

785
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,979
Speaker 0: It has for a very long time.

786
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:05,500
Speaker 1: The same way that the Jesus birthday happened to be sometime around the Saturnalia and the pagan Yule, right?

787
00:51:05,681 --> 00:51:08,697
Speaker 1: It's like, so what happened is some decades ago, right?

788
00:51:09,761 --> 00:51:14,900
Speaker 1: You know, when all the Christian kids are getting their presents and doing their Christmas, the Jews were like, yeah, you know what?

789
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,031
Speaker 1: We got the Sonicas pretty close, right?

790
00:51:17,071 --> 00:51:18,780
Speaker 1: I'm sure you could look up actually how this happened.

791
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,820
Speaker 1: Maybe someone did it on purpose, like with Kwanzaa, which is on purpose.

792
00:51:23,481 --> 00:51:30,700
Speaker 0: Well, that was probably Hanukkah Harry, just like the real, you know, the saint that Santa Claus was based on.

793
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,959
Speaker 0: Maybe Hanukkah Harry was real.

794
00:51:32,907 --> 00:51:33,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe.

795
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:42,520
Speaker 0: Hanukkah Harry, who is the name we now give to whoever, started purposefully conflating Hanukkah with those holidays to give the Jewish kids something in pop culture.

796
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:54,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know, Hanukkah just became like, you know, the thing for Jews to celebrate during the holiday season so they could get presents for their kids, capitalism, you know, not feeling left out, etc.

797
00:51:56,362 --> 00:52:14,280
Speaker 1: And I think that's sort of like, you know, every, I guess, you know, I guess not every, but like lots of different cultures and religions have done sort of the same thing, which is like, yeah, around the December times, you know, they do something even if they didn't originally have something, right?

798
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:19,100
Speaker 0: See, if I was making a new religion now, like say something bad happens and I have to form a cult.

799
00:52:19,301 --> 00:52:21,234
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I would like that's probably my go to.

800
00:52:21,314 --> 00:52:22,180
Speaker 0: if society collapsed.

801
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:31,720
Speaker 0: As I've said many times in my life, I would make that holiday in February because the idea for I would have is February is when you're sick of this shit.

802
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:32,944
Speaker 0: It's the coldest.

803
00:52:32,964 --> 00:52:33,871
Speaker 1: February sucks ass.

804
00:52:33,931 --> 00:52:35,199
Speaker 1: It's when we need a holiday the most.

805
00:52:35,622 --> 00:52:37,600
Speaker 1: And all we got is shitty fake Valentine's Day.

806
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:40,500
Speaker 0: February should be the month of don't do anything.

807
00:52:42,461 --> 00:52:43,344
Speaker 0: Forget a day of rest.

808
00:52:43,364 --> 00:52:44,347
Speaker 0: We got a month of rest.

809
00:52:44,508 --> 00:52:45,331
Speaker 0: That's how I do it.

810
00:52:45,551 --> 00:52:48,280
Speaker 0: That's how my cult will operate after the apocalypse.

811
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:49,740
Speaker 1: Yeah.

812
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:52,568
Speaker 1: And I'll just say, right, you know, as as a Jew.

813
00:52:52,588 --> 00:52:53,050
Speaker 1: Right.

814
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:56,580
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, when I looked around my town, there was plenty of Hanukkah going on.

815
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:56,861
Speaker 1: Right.

816
00:52:56,881 --> 00:53:01,740
Speaker 1: Because we had a disproportionate number of Jews relative to the world and national population.

817
00:53:03,101 --> 00:53:09,980
Speaker 1: But, you know, in the I didn't realize until later on like how little Jewishness there was around everywhere else.

818
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:10,361
Speaker 1: Right.

819
00:53:10,924 --> 00:53:13,755
Speaker 1: And so I perhaps didn't appreciate right full.

820
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:15,020
Speaker 1: I did appreciate somewhat.

821
00:53:15,301 --> 00:53:15,523
Speaker 1: Right.

822
00:53:15,623 --> 00:53:18,599
Speaker 1: But I didn't you know, I should have appreciated even more than I did.

823
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,082
Speaker 1: Right.

824
00:53:19,102 --> 00:53:22,678
Speaker 1: It's like when I saw like Hanukkah stuff on TV or something, I'd be like, oh, look at that.

825
00:53:22,959 --> 00:53:23,100
Speaker 1: Right.

826
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,102
Speaker 1: Oh, we got some.

827
00:53:24,263 --> 00:53:24,544
Speaker 1: Right.

828
00:53:24,905 --> 00:53:29,720
Speaker 1: But I should have been perhaps two or three times more excited about that because there's not a lot.

829
00:53:30,101 --> 00:53:31,124
Speaker 0: Yeah.

830
00:53:31,325 --> 00:53:35,360
Speaker 1: I mean, Rugrats was like the one thing that had a Hanukkah and we were like, hell yes.

831
00:53:35,541 --> 00:53:40,199
Speaker 0: That and Adam Sandler's song, actually, like there's a reason why that song is a Jew.

832
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,021
Speaker 1: Yeah.

833
00:53:41,061 --> 00:53:45,060
Speaker 0: But that song pierced non-Jewish pop culture.

834
00:53:47,122 --> 00:53:48,326
Speaker 0: Like people know that song.

835
00:53:48,406 --> 00:53:49,069
Speaker 0: I'm not Jewish.

836
00:53:49,209 --> 00:53:50,032
Speaker 0: I knew that song.

837
00:53:50,052 --> 00:53:52,220
Speaker 0: I know all the words to that song.

838
00:53:53,042 --> 00:53:54,893
Speaker 1: That song was a big deal in 1990, whatever.

839
00:53:54,933 --> 00:53:55,114
Speaker 1: Right.

840
00:53:57,142 --> 00:54:10,520
Speaker 0: In Catholic school, funnily enough, unlike a lot of other Christian denominations, like being pretending to be Catholic as a young atheist in a Catholic school, the school actually did a better job than a lot of other schools of teaching about other religions.

841
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,948
Speaker 0: And they would do like a Hanukkah thing every year.

842
00:54:13,429 --> 00:54:16,560
Speaker 0: But it was very simple and stereotypical.

843
00:54:17,001 --> 00:54:18,808
Speaker 0: We'd all make dreidels, but we didn't.

844
00:54:18,868 --> 00:54:20,515
Speaker 0: actually they didn't explain what the dreidel was.

845
00:54:20,555 --> 00:54:21,780
Speaker 0: We just make them gambling.

846
00:54:22,983 --> 00:54:24,186
Speaker 0: They did not explain that.

847
00:54:24,808 --> 00:54:29,420
Speaker 0: And they would give us gelt, not really explaining, not really delicious, worse than Hershey's.

848
00:54:29,922 --> 00:54:32,720
Speaker 1: But at least it comes in fun, gold foil wrappers.

849
00:54:33,361 --> 00:54:38,540
Speaker 0: And usually we'd have the advent calendar, but we would also do the menorah in the Catholic school.

850
00:54:40,161 --> 00:54:40,361
Speaker 1: Yeah.

851
00:54:40,381 --> 00:54:48,360
Speaker 1: You know, the something about, you know, the menorah, it's like there's certain like the specific candle you put in the menorah.

852
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:49,343
Speaker 1: You buy this box.

853
00:54:49,464 --> 00:54:49,665
Speaker 1: Right.

854
00:54:49,725 --> 00:54:54,040
Speaker 1: And it's like this like, you know, I at least I recognize the box.

855
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:57,119
Speaker 1: Like it's like that's the only Hanukkah candle is the one that comes in that box.

856
00:54:57,762 --> 00:54:59,167
Speaker 1: I forget I forget the name of it.

857
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:02,540
Speaker 1: What's the name of the stupid candle?

858
00:55:03,481 --> 00:55:04,466
Speaker 1: I'm doing a Google search.

859
00:55:04,808 --> 00:55:07,080
Speaker 1: There's other brands nowadays that have taken over.

860
00:55:07,481 --> 00:55:07,702
Speaker 1: Right.

861
00:55:08,144 --> 00:55:11,197
Speaker 1: But there's one specific one that's like the real one.

862
00:55:11,217 --> 00:55:11,800
Speaker 1: Right.

863
00:55:12,522 --> 00:55:12,742
Speaker 0: Yeah.

864
00:55:12,802 --> 00:55:13,143
Speaker 0: I've seen.

865
00:55:13,203 --> 00:55:20,880
Speaker 0: I've seen, you know, because New York, very Jewish city, a lot of there's like everyone's got Christmas and Hanukkah stuff out, like very visibly.

866
00:55:21,681 --> 00:55:31,140
Speaker 0: And in a lot of capital markets, like firms in their lobby, they'll usually have an extremely stylized to the point of almost being unrecognizable menorah.

867
00:55:31,941 --> 00:55:32,081
Speaker 1: Yeah.

868
00:55:32,181 --> 00:55:32,642
Speaker 1: All right.

869
00:55:32,702 --> 00:55:34,606
Speaker 1: I found the box, but the box actually.

870
00:55:34,626 --> 00:55:41,280
Speaker 1: I guess the reason that I never had a name for this particular box is because it doesn't have a brand name on it.

871
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:48,200
Speaker 1: It just says, you know, 44 twist candles, twisted candles made in Israel, Hanukkah candles, kosher.

872
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:48,981
Speaker 1: Right.

873
00:55:49,121 --> 00:55:52,580
Speaker 1: Product of Tel Aviv, Israel, telephone number.

874
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:53,742
Speaker 1: Forty four candles.

875
00:55:53,903 --> 00:55:54,123
Speaker 1: Right.

876
00:55:54,484 --> 00:56:01,740
Speaker 1: And is this very specific artwork and the candles like they have this wax that smells a specific way and melts it pretty quickly.

877
00:56:01,881 --> 00:56:06,400
Speaker 1: Actually, they don't last very long for a holiday about oil that lasted too long.

878
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:08,240
Speaker 1: The Hanukkah candles sure don't last long at all.

879
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,454
Speaker 0: It's to remind you that you like.

880
00:56:10,474 --> 00:56:11,300
Speaker 1: you like that shit.

881
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,668
Speaker 1: You like that shit after dinner.

882
00:56:12,688 --> 00:56:14,560
Speaker 1: That shit's melted before you go to bed.

883
00:56:14,861 --> 00:56:17,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, well, it's good because you won't create a fire hazard.

884
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,713
Speaker 0: Catholic churches, like really traditional ones.

885
00:56:19,753 --> 00:56:20,700
Speaker 0: There's a big candle.

886
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,360
Speaker 0: I forget all the details of why we have it or why they have it.

887
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,880
Speaker 1: Is it like the votive candle or whatever?

888
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:26,420
Speaker 0: No, votive candles are a different thing.

889
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:26,741
Speaker 0: That's.

890
00:56:26,762 --> 00:56:30,280
Speaker 0: that's the thing you see in movies where like someone lights a candle for someone who's dead.

891
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,258
Speaker 0: And usually there's a dramatic scene around it.

892
00:56:33,041 --> 00:56:35,059
Speaker 0: There's movies where like the assassin will go.

893
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,872
Speaker 1: Jews have the candle for someone who's dead.

894
00:56:36,912 --> 00:56:37,840
Speaker 1: It's the yahrzeit candle.

895
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:41,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there's another candle that it's just the same candle forever.

896
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:42,161
Speaker 0: Like it'll.

897
00:56:42,181 --> 00:56:46,680
Speaker 0: basically if you just lit it and left it lit, it will burn for fucking ever.

898
00:56:47,402 --> 00:56:51,460
Speaker 0: And they light it like it's special times and they keep the same candle forever.

899
00:56:53,462 --> 00:57:06,780
Speaker 0: But I found something great just skimming through the Wikipedia article on it, because I have associations mostly hanging out with you of like one, celebrating in quotes Christmas by just going out and getting Chinese food, which feels like a very Jewish holiday tradition.

900
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:08,339
Speaker 0: Go and see a movie.

901
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:11,520
Speaker 0: But also, you know, food like latkes.

902
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,599
Speaker 0: We'd always like made latkes around this time of year.

903
00:57:14,162 --> 00:57:17,280
Speaker 1: Well, the reason you make the latkes for Hanukkah is because it's a holiday about oil.

904
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:18,858
Speaker 1: So you got to keep fry shit, right?

905
00:57:19,161 --> 00:57:21,060
Speaker 0: So there's a section in the Wikipedia article.

906
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:21,860
Speaker 0: There's a paragraph.

907
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:28,260
Speaker 0: You're going to read it really quick that talks about what Jewish cultures in other parts of the world, like.

908
00:57:28,321 --> 00:57:31,620
Speaker 0: what is their go to food around Hanukkah?

909
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:38,019
Speaker 0: Indian Jews traditionally consume a galab jamun, which is a like fried dough thing that I actually am a big fan of.

910
00:57:39,725 --> 00:57:40,277
Speaker 0: Let's see.

911
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:41,980
Speaker 0: Italian Jews.

912
00:57:42,642 --> 00:57:44,140
Speaker 0: Italian Jews eat fried chicken.

913
00:57:44,825 --> 00:57:45,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's fried.

914
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:49,019
Speaker 0: And they make a latke like thing out of ricotta.

915
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:50,384
Speaker 1: Mmm.

916
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:55,540
Speaker 0: Fratello de riso parrhatica, fried sweet potato pancakes.

917
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:57,600
Speaker 0: Romanian Jews eat pasta latkes.

918
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:58,499
Speaker 0: So again, fried.

919
00:57:58,901 --> 00:58:00,259
Speaker 0: You see the theme is holding true.

920
00:58:01,173 --> 00:58:01,299
Speaker 1: Oil.

921
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:06,420
Speaker 0: Syrian Jews eat a dish made with pumpkin and bulgur wheat that is similar to latkes.

922
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:08,488
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

923
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:09,540
Speaker 0: That's the whole paragraph.

924
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:10,276
Speaker 0: We ran out.

925
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:11,256
Speaker 1: All right.

926
00:58:11,782 --> 00:58:12,040
Speaker 1: But yeah.

927
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,060
Speaker 1: So it's, you know, it's an oil based holiday.

928
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,319
Speaker 1: It's going to have oil based foods.

929
00:58:16,441 --> 00:58:21,340
Speaker 0: I am a fan of oil based foods and I have enjoyed many a Christmas having Chinese food with you and our other friends.

930
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:22,216
Speaker 1: Yeah.

931
00:58:22,641 --> 00:58:28,100
Speaker 1: I mean, the thing about the latke that's most important isn't really the fried potato, which is, you know, a pain in the ass, right?

932
00:58:28,841 --> 00:58:30,220
Speaker 1: It's the topping, right?

933
00:58:30,301 --> 00:58:32,060
Speaker 1: You got sour cream and you got applesauce.

934
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,019
Speaker 1: And you can also go both at the same time.

935
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:35,680
Speaker 0: Both at the same time is the pro move.

936
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:39,420
Speaker 1: A lot of people, you know, but it's some people, they don't like the applesauce.

937
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:40,799
Speaker 1: Some people don't like sour cream.

938
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:42,019
Speaker 1: You know, they do it wrong.

939
00:58:43,021 --> 00:58:45,040
Speaker 0: Thing is, what we did wrong was frying it wrong.

940
00:58:45,342 --> 00:58:46,619
Speaker 0: We fucking sucked at that.

941
00:58:46,941 --> 00:58:48,260
Speaker 0: We know how to cook so much better now.

942
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:57,580
Speaker 1: Listen, if you go to any Jewish family's house for a Hanukkah festivity, there's going to be basically fighting about who's going to fry the latkes.

943
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:00,280
Speaker 1: Because even if you don't do, it's not hard to make them.

944
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,320
Speaker 1: You shred up a potato on the box grater or your food processor.

945
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:09,840
Speaker 0: And if you know even like the bare basics of cooking with oil, you will not make the mistakes that we made in college.

946
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:10,857
Speaker 1: Right.

947
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,380
Speaker 1: You know, you put some flour and some other stuff in with the potato.

948
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:16,820
Speaker 0: Also, get the oil hot before you let the potatoes touch it.

949
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:19,280
Speaker 0: Otherwise, the oil just goes right into the potatoes and they're horrible.

950
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:20,250
Speaker 1: Yep.

951
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:27,520
Speaker 1: But even if you use the mix, right, which doesn't taste bad at all, instead of doing the potato, it saves you a bit of work.

952
00:59:27,923 --> 00:59:29,460
Speaker 1: You can't avoid the frying part.

953
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:35,140
Speaker 1: And it's like frying them kind of sucks and is like annoying to sit there and baby them and get oil all over yourself.

954
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:38,132
Speaker 0: You got to baby them way more than what I would say.

955
00:59:38,373 --> 00:59:40,060
Speaker 0: you baby a typical fried dish.

956
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:40,836
Speaker 1: Yeah.

957
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:43,899
Speaker 1: So there's always going to be some sort of argument about who's going to do it.

958
00:59:44,541 --> 00:59:46,740
Speaker 1: Who's going to get forced to actually make the latkes.

959
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:47,757
Speaker 1: Everyone wants to eat them.

960
00:59:48,064 --> 00:59:48,220
Speaker 1: Yeah.

961
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:48,540
Speaker 1: Right.

962
00:59:48,761 --> 00:59:50,099
Speaker 1: But no one wants to make them.

963
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:57,160
Speaker 0: I imagine two parallel threads of contention because contention thread one, nobody wants to be the one stuck in the kitchen fucking making them.

964
00:59:57,602 --> 01:00:01,760
Speaker 0: But contention thread two, nobody wants whoever's shitty at it being stuck making them.

965
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:02,872
Speaker 1: Yep.

966
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:04,156
Speaker 1: Yeah.

967
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:08,219
Speaker 1: So, you know, it was always interesting because it's like, you know, you got these eight days of Hanukkah.

968
01:00:08,861 --> 01:00:11,620
Speaker 1: But you would still want to do like it's eight days.

969
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,420
Speaker 1: You're not going to hang out with your extended family for eight days.

970
01:00:14,484 --> 01:00:14,615
Speaker 0: No.

971
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:20,940
Speaker 0: Even at Christmas, like we would visit one of the set of grandparents on like Christmas Eve and another one on Christmas Day.

972
01:00:21,321 --> 01:00:22,284
Speaker 0: And that was already.

973
01:00:22,304 --> 01:00:27,400
Speaker 0: the entire family is at one hundred and fifty percent capacity of seeing relatives.

974
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,579
Speaker 0: And nobody wants to meet up again after that for a while.

975
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:37,540
Speaker 1: See, we were in, I guess, a lucky situation that only there were only cousins and children, which are all similarly aged on my father's side.

976
01:00:38,524 --> 01:00:40,080
Speaker 1: No one really on my mother's side.

977
01:00:40,201 --> 01:00:43,478
Speaker 1: So we only had to get one extended family for Hanukkah.

978
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:44,300
Speaker 1: Right.

979
01:00:44,862 --> 01:00:50,920
Speaker 1: And so, you know, you'd have your eight days and, you know, at home after dinner, it would be like we finished.

980
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,460
Speaker 1: You'd finish dinner, you'd light the candle, you'd get a present.

981
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:55,141
Speaker 1: Right.

982
01:00:55,281 --> 01:00:55,643
Speaker 1: Whatever.

983
01:00:55,844 --> 01:00:58,760
Speaker 1: Sometimes you just go to school the next day to come home, get another present.

984
01:00:59,060 --> 01:00:59,182
Speaker 1: Yeah.

985
01:00:59,202 --> 01:01:00,180
Speaker 1: Moms hide them in the basement.

986
01:01:01,362 --> 01:01:05,020
Speaker 1: And then there would be one day where you'd get the extended family going on.

987
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,556
Speaker 1: Might not even be during the eight days if you couldn't manage it.

988
01:01:07,576 --> 01:01:08,240
Speaker 1: schedule wise.

989
01:01:08,401 --> 01:01:08,602
Speaker 1: Right.

990
01:01:09,425 --> 01:01:10,832
Speaker 1: That would be the extended family.

991
01:01:10,872 --> 01:01:12,660
Speaker 1: Hanukkah presents for everybody.

992
01:01:13,322 --> 01:01:15,900
Speaker 1: And then we got old and like around the time when we were in college.

993
01:01:16,102 --> 01:01:16,304
Speaker 1: Right.

994
01:01:16,345 --> 01:01:17,599
Speaker 1: Everyone was similarly aged.

995
01:01:18,322 --> 01:01:24,400
Speaker 1: You know, we just sort of, you know, I think one time we tried, you know, everyone buy presents for everyone kind of deal.

996
01:01:24,741 --> 01:01:25,064
Speaker 1: Right.

997
01:01:25,509 --> 01:01:26,297
Speaker 1: And it was kind of meh.

998
01:01:26,821 --> 01:01:30,159
Speaker 1: And then we're just like, you know what, buying presents is a pain in the ass.

999
01:01:30,681 --> 01:01:30,901
Speaker 1: Right.

1000
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:36,680
Speaker 1: All of us are, you know, lucky and privileged and well off enough to buy shit we want for ourselves.

1001
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:37,322
Speaker 1: Right.

1002
01:01:37,525 --> 01:01:38,699
Speaker 1: No one fucking wants anything.

1003
01:01:40,221 --> 01:01:45,560
Speaker 1: Let's just, you know, the present will all give each other is not having to fucking go buy presents for everybody.

1004
01:01:47,363 --> 01:01:48,450
Speaker 1: And we just sort of stopped.

1005
01:01:48,732 --> 01:01:49,959
Speaker 1: We just sort of stopped the Hanukkah.

1006
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:50,381
Speaker 1: Right.

1007
01:01:50,503 --> 01:01:51,919
Speaker 1: At least for the extended family.

1008
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:55,800
Speaker 1: You know, I got a electric menorah.

1009
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:59,400
Speaker 1: I actually made a USB powered menorah some years ago.

1010
01:01:59,681 --> 01:01:59,921
Speaker 1: Right.

1011
01:01:59,961 --> 01:02:06,200
Speaker 1: And I'm just like, you know what, you know, I don't believe in any of this nonsense, obviously, but it's fun to make.

1012
01:02:06,561 --> 01:02:07,224
Speaker 1: It's fun to have.

1013
01:02:07,486 --> 01:02:09,940
Speaker 1: So I can change the colors too.

1014
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,469
Speaker 1: I don't got to set a fire.

1015
01:02:11,953 --> 01:02:13,040
Speaker 1: Don't got to melt any candles.

1016
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:19,619
Speaker 0: I mean, this weekend I'm going to go out on the balcony and hang up some Christmas lights for the rest of the year and maybe a few weeks into the new year like I do.

1017
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:23,100
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm a I'm an angry, loud atheist.

1018
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,168
Speaker 0: It's not like I believe in Christmas, but I still like.

1019
01:02:25,449 --> 01:02:28,180
Speaker 0: I like a good Christmas song hanging out in the snow.

1020
01:02:29,661 --> 01:02:33,420
Speaker 1: But I think maybe next week I'll deal with the pain in the ass and make a latke.

1021
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:34,559
Speaker 0: Ooh, make a latke.

1022
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:39,920
Speaker 1: Maybe this weekend I'll make a latke, even though it's a little early because Hanukkah starts on Sunday night.

1023
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:41,340
Speaker 0: Make the practice latke this weekend.

1024
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,579
Speaker 1: Make it on Sunday night.

1025
01:02:45,922 --> 01:02:46,345
Speaker 1: All right.

1026
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:49,000
Speaker 0: So I guess it's time to go see how that hockey game's going.

1027
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:50,040
Speaker 0: I think we'll stop the show right there.

1028
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,980
Speaker 1: It didn't start yet because they got some ceremonies.

1029
01:02:52,703 --> 01:02:53,312
Speaker 0: Oh, good.

1030
01:02:53,373 --> 01:02:53,820
Speaker 0: I was worried.

1031
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:55,380
Speaker 1: It's about to start like in Tuesday.

1032
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:56,600
Speaker 0: Perfect timing.

1033
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,000

1044
01:03:52,602 --> 01:03:55,800
Speaker 0: So I won't say their names because otherwise this list would be way too long.

1045

1046
01:03:58,101 --> 01:04:03,380
