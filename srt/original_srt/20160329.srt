1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,048
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, March 29th, 2016.

2
00:00:12,048 --> 00:00:16,939
Speaker 1: I'm Rim, I'm Scott, and this is Geek Nights Tonight, 6 Nymphs.

3
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:19,718
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,350
Speaker 1: So as you all know, we were at Anime Boston.

5
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,327
Speaker 1: Those of you who might have found us because of Anime Boston, Hey, this is Geek Nights Tuesday.

6
00:00:28,367 --> 00:00:31,400
Speaker 1: We're going to talk about games and stuff, not so much the anime.

7
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,569
Speaker 1: But, on the way home, Scott and I were bored.

8
00:00:34,589 --> 00:00:37,580
Speaker 1: You know, it was going to be a long bus ride and we didn't even go to the con on Sunday.

9
00:00:37,982 --> 00:00:42,060
Speaker 1: So we sat down and I asked the question I always ask whenever me and Scott are alone together.

10
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:42,979
Speaker 0: You want to play Advance Wars?

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,880
Speaker 1: It's either you want to play Advance Wars or you want to play Civ 5.

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,415
Speaker 1: And for the first time in my life, that clock rang and Scott said, "You know what?

13
00:00:52,957 --> 00:00:53,418
Speaker 1: Yeah.".

14
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,540
Speaker 0: I figured it would make the bus ride go much faster.

15
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,207
Speaker 1: And it did, actually.

16
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:00,780
Speaker 1: We played Civ 5 Hot Seat, which I've never done.

17
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,999
Speaker 0: We should have done it with two laptops and played two games.

18
00:01:03,683 --> 00:01:04,325
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah.

19
00:01:04,346 --> 00:01:07,740
Speaker 1: That would have been perfect, except I'm the only one of us who had a laptop that could play Civ 5.

20
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,113
Speaker 0: Why don't they make--my iPad Pro is better than your laptop.

21
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:11,320
Speaker 0: Why don't they make Civ 5 for it?

22
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:11,942
Speaker 1: I don't know.

23
00:01:12,002 --> 00:01:21,280
Speaker 1: That's actually the one--the only reason I'm leery of the iPad is, as much as I want one, I like to play games like Rocket League and Civ 5 on my laptop when I travel.

24
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,558
Speaker 0: Oh, you can just play different games.

25
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:23,302
Speaker 1: Like what?

26
00:01:23,362 --> 00:01:27,380
Speaker 1: What game is as good as Civ 5 or Rocket League or Counter Strike that you can play on the iPad?

27
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:28,039
Speaker 0: Hearthstone.

28
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:29,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, that sounds pretty good.

29
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,459
Speaker 0: Hearthstone is the best iPad game you can play.

30
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

31
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,331
Speaker 0: That's the reason--that's the only reason I play it.

32
00:01:34,371 --> 00:01:35,559
Speaker 0: If it were--there was--right?

33
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,359
Speaker 0: It's like--it's literally the best mobile game that exists.

34
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,436
Speaker 1: But when I'm in, like, Hong Kong or something for a week and I got, you know-- There's mad Hearthstone going on there.

35
00:01:43,517 --> 00:01:43,699
Speaker 0: Whoa.

36
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I would rather be playing Rocket League.

37
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,699
Speaker 0: Well, why don't you just go to, like, a night cafe?

38
00:01:49,161 --> 00:01:49,678
Speaker 1: Because I could.

39
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,680
Speaker 0: And you'd get your ass crushed by some Chinese Rocket League.

40
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,360
Speaker 1: So, I had also never tried the, like, tiny map format, so we just played it dual.

41
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,640
Speaker 1: It was just me and Scott on continent, so we each had a tiny continent.

42
00:02:02,621 --> 00:02:04,559
Speaker 1: And there's four city-states out there.

43
00:02:05,283 --> 00:02:06,240
Speaker 1: And we just started going.

44
00:02:07,281 --> 00:02:11,019
Speaker 1: And at the end of the bus ride when we got to New York, we'd made it about a hundred turns in.

45
00:02:11,501 --> 00:02:14,660
Speaker 1: And we were just getting to the point where things were getting real interesting.

46
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,880
Speaker 0: The main problem was just, like, I think in the dual map, right?

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,140
Speaker 0: It's, like, things that normally can be mitigated.

48
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:21,980
Speaker 0: It's, like, the game is real different, right?

49
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,040
Speaker 0: Because you had the guys that have mad boats.

50
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:24,640
Speaker 0: Yup.

51
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,320
Speaker 0: And the map was such that I was on an island and you were on an island.

52
00:02:27,401 --> 00:02:29,039
Speaker 0: My starting city was not on the coast.

53
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,220
Speaker 1: Don't you know the automatic, intrinsic start biases of all the different civilizations?

54
00:02:33,561 --> 00:02:35,580
Speaker 0: I didn't know that that was what the map was going to look like.

55
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,100
Speaker 1: I said continents were probably going to be on two different continents because there's only two of us.

56
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,840
Speaker 0: Right, but I didn't realize that your guy was going to have, like, something that gives you a free million boats.

57
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:45,919
Speaker 1: Yeah, well.

58
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,060
Speaker 0: Like, I figured, like, you know, I didn't, because I don't know all the stupid things in the game.

59
00:02:50,201 --> 00:02:51,020
Speaker 0: There's so many fucking things.

60
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,919
Speaker 0: I didn't even know that was a thing until you used it.

61
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,938
Speaker 1: Yeah, I realized that your only problem with Civ V was that you just haven't played it enough, so you don't know stuff.

62
00:02:57,801 --> 00:02:59,197
Speaker 1: Think about how much you know about Civ II.

63
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:06,180
Speaker 1: Like, you probably remember what almost every wonder does to this day, even though they don't actually, like, they don't have analogs to modern wonders.

64
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,052
Speaker 0: No, I didn't really know.

65
00:03:08,072 --> 00:03:08,697
Speaker 0: I only knew it.

66
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,199
Speaker 1: You knew Leonardo's Workshop, I'll bet, and the pyramids.

67
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,220
Speaker 0: So, I knew Leonardo's Workshop, and you know why I like Leonardo's Workshop so much?

68
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,400
Speaker 1: Because you don't have to deal with the upgrades.

69
00:03:15,721 --> 00:03:16,999
Speaker 0: Also because it had the best music.

70
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:17,713
Speaker 1: Yeah, it did.

71
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,600
Speaker 1: And everyone knew the pyramids, because nobody wanted to build the stupid granary everywhere.

72
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, it gives you free granary everywhere.

73
00:03:26,983 --> 00:03:27,050
Speaker 1: Yup.

74
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:34,800
Speaker 1: Though, I've noticed when I play, because I've been playing, you know, not to plug giant multiplayer robot, but I actually paid money now, so I can be in a lot more games.

75
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:39,280
Speaker 1: I use this thing a lot, and the way it actually works, it's five bucks.

76
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:44,300
Speaker 1: You just give them five bucks, and you can play up to five games instead of just two forever.

77
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,457
Speaker 1: Just five bucks once.

78
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,760
Speaker 1: I think fifteen bucks is unlimited games forever.

79
00:03:50,020 --> 00:04:09,500
Speaker 1: I paid the five bucks, and I got three games going, and I did do my commentary on the big game, but playing the duel against Scott, one thing I realized is that if you have a small empire like that, and you want to rush wonders and rush tradition, you can do like tradition, get some marble early, and just crank out wonders.

80
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:21,158
Speaker 0: That's another thing I didn't realize is I had some marble right fucking there, and I didn't realize what it did until I finally... Until I finally got my worker to work it, and this message pops up, and I'm like, "Oh, that's what RIM's

81
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:21,620
Speaker 0: doing.".

82
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,260
Speaker 0: If I would have known that, I would have gotten a worker even earlier and worked it right immediately.

83
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,660
Speaker 0: I did, because I did get the tradition thing immediately, right?

84
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:30,117
Speaker 0: Yup.

85
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:35,179
Speaker 0: I just didn't get the worker on it immediately, because I didn't realize what, you know, I'm just like, "Oh, it's a...".

86
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,192
Speaker 0: You know, when I see like rocks, I'm like, "Oh, mine the rocks, get production, all right.

87
00:04:39,472 --> 00:04:40,516
Speaker 0: I want to get the food first.

88
00:04:40,556 --> 00:04:41,559
Speaker 0: I'll go make a farm

89
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:41,940
Speaker 0: first.".

90
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:44,020
Speaker 1: I think a lot about those things.

91
00:04:44,564 --> 00:04:45,430
Speaker 0: I don't know all those things.

92
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,860
Speaker 0: There's way too many fucking things.

93
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,679
Speaker 0: There's not that many.

94
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,360
Speaker 0: There's so many things in this game.

95
00:04:49,681 --> 00:04:50,940
Speaker 1: I feel like I know most of them.

96
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:59,700
Speaker 0: You got culture things, you got sciences, you got buildings, you got wonders, you got units, you got fucking things that you can like get at the councils.

97
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,760
Speaker 0: There's just so many goddamn things, and great people can do like three different things.

98
00:05:06,186 --> 00:05:07,500
Speaker 0: I can't remember all these fucking things.

99
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,220
Speaker 1: But Civ 2 had a similar level of bullshit.

100
00:05:10,521 --> 00:05:12,841
Speaker 0: I just didn't know the things when I played Civ 2.

101
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:13,424
Speaker 0: I just played.

102
00:05:13,464 --> 00:05:15,375
Speaker 0: I never played Civ 2 multiplayer either.

103
00:05:15,435 --> 00:05:16,340
Speaker 0: I played against the computer.

104
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:17,160
Speaker 1: I always wanted to.

105
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,080
Speaker 0: I never played against it, and I was never able to beat it on like any kind of hard level.

106
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,138
Speaker 0: I played it normal at the most, and I just sort of played like by feels, just sort of like, "All right, build

107
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:26,419
Speaker 0: stuff.".

108
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:26,847
Speaker 1: Yep.

109
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,224
Speaker 0: You know, "Oh, there's a wonder.

110
00:05:28,285 --> 00:05:29,329
Speaker 0: I can build it in seven turns.

111
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:29,852
Speaker 0: I'll build it.

112
00:05:30,093 --> 00:05:30,816
Speaker 0: I don't know what it does.

113
00:05:30,836 --> 00:05:31,379
Speaker 0: I'm just going to build

114
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:31,439
Speaker 0: it.".

115
00:05:33,163 --> 00:05:33,880
Speaker 0: Just building stuff.

116
00:05:34,588 --> 00:05:34,800
Speaker 0: Yeah.

117
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,097
Speaker 0: I didn't really even understand like the concepts that like, "Oh, you get food, and then you get

118
00:05:39,158 --> 00:05:39,700
Speaker 0: population.".

119
00:05:39,901 --> 00:05:40,466
Speaker 0: I didn't know that.

120
00:05:40,526 --> 00:05:42,260
Speaker 0: I just like, you just build stuff.

121
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,745
Speaker 1: You're like, "What are all those red guys?

122
00:05:43,805 --> 00:05:44,728
Speaker 1: I guess I'll ignore them.

123
00:05:44,788 --> 00:05:46,233
Speaker 1: Hey, why is that guy wearing black?

124
00:05:46,273 --> 00:05:47,738
Speaker 1: Why did my city just revolt?

125
00:05:47,758 --> 00:05:48,099
Speaker 1: What's going

126
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:48,159
Speaker 1: on?".

127
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,049
Speaker 0: I would just go to cities, and I would click "Produce this next.

128
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:54,220
Speaker 0: That looks fun," and then click "Next turn," and then move units around, you know.

129
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:54,747
Speaker 0: Yeah.

130
00:05:55,201 --> 00:05:56,954
Speaker 0: I didn't really know what stuff did.

131
00:05:56,994 --> 00:05:57,739
Speaker 0: I just like, "Oh," you know.

132
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,060
Speaker 0: But

133
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:09,819
Speaker 1: I like Civ 5, and I played it a lot because, you know, on long trips, like especially if I'm flying to like East Asia, and I've got like a 12 or 13 hour flight, you can get most of the way through a single player Civ 5 game in a flight like that.

134
00:06:10,361 --> 00:06:19,540
Speaker 1: So I would just play like these long games, but pretty bored playing against the AI, and I'm kind of addicted to playing Civ against humans now.

135
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,340
Speaker 0: I can't even beat the AI in anything like above Prince, and if I do Prince, I can only beat it sometimes.

136
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:25,852
Speaker 0: Really?

137
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,629
Speaker 0: And only using like the space shuttle.

138
00:06:27,649 --> 00:06:29,500
Speaker 0: Like every time I try something different, it doesn't work.

139
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,120
Speaker 1: So if I ever go for something different, I kind of accidentally get a domination victory along the way, so it doesn't matter.

140
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,966
Speaker 0: That's the thing, is I can't, like I don't war.

141
00:06:36,986 --> 00:06:41,640
Speaker 0: I basically expand with settlers to fill my space, and then I turtle.

142
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,380
Speaker 0: And then I just build stuff.

143
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,160
Speaker 1: See, this is why I think this duel, so we played that game halfway, and we saved it on my laptop.

144
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,080
Speaker 1: We're going to wait until the bust packs and continue the game.

145
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,320
Speaker 0: I think we should play a different game, one where you don't have the entire water covered in boats.

146
00:06:56,428 --> 00:06:58,299
Speaker 0: If you- Well, I mean, what hope do I really have?

147
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,335
Speaker 1: So Scott, that water's covered in boats, but you realize it's just like seven triremes.

148
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,520
Speaker 1: I can't take a city with that.

149
00:07:04,481 --> 00:07:06,679
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I can't move any boats around.

150
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,699
Speaker 1: Well, you didn't focus on boats.

151
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,780
Speaker 0: But how do I- I need to see the map still and go looking for stuff.

152
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,175
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's one more island that neither one of us got to.

153
00:07:14,215 --> 00:07:14,860
Speaker 1: You know what's on it?

154
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,300
Speaker 1: More barbarians than you can imagine, one city-state, two unexplored huts.

155
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,486
Speaker 0: Right, but it's like, even if you take that island, it's like I can't expand my territories or do anything because any boat- Scott, there's nothing else in the whole world.

156
00:07:27,526 --> 00:07:30,180
Speaker 1: Unless you conquer something, there's literally nowhere else to settle.

157
00:07:30,481 --> 00:07:32,280
Speaker 0: I still need to see what else is in the world.

158
00:07:32,462 --> 00:07:32,527
Speaker 0: Why?

159
00:07:32,943 --> 00:07:34,480
Speaker 0: There's some natural wonders out there.

160
00:07:34,761 --> 00:07:36,400
Speaker 1: I think there's only two natural wonders.

161
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,400
Speaker 0: I haven't seen any of them.

162
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:37,846
Speaker 0: Really?

163
00:07:37,886 --> 00:07:38,660
Speaker 1: There's one on my continent.

164
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know what they look like, and then my people would be very happy to see them.

165
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,747
Speaker 1: So here's another thing, because I've noticed this.

166
00:07:43,888 --> 00:07:46,200
Speaker 1: In these games, there are three kinds of civilizations.

167
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,060
Speaker 0: And I can see what your territory looks like and keep an eye on you.

168
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:58,580
Speaker 1: You can't just build one trireme unless you literally only have that trireme to keep barbarians from taking your one or two work boats that are hanging out there.

169
00:07:59,022 --> 00:08:03,120
Speaker 1: You either build a fuck ton of boats, or you just don't build boats.

170
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,468
Speaker 0: See, but that's the thing.

171
00:08:04,488 --> 00:08:05,940
Speaker 0: My starting city was not in the water.

172
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,640
Speaker 1: Then you gotta be a land civilization.

173
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,240
Speaker 0: Okay, so now I'm trapped in this little island.

174
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,548
Speaker 1: Yeah, so min-max that island.

175
00:08:12,588 --> 00:08:15,480
Speaker 1: Just build a wall that I can't come in with with artillery and nonsense.

176
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:16,719
Speaker 0: How am I gonna win the game with that?

177
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,640
Speaker 1: I don't know culture.

178
00:08:18,021 --> 00:08:19,179
Speaker 0: I don't think I can win the game with that.

179
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:19,808
Speaker 1: Alright.

180
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,073
Speaker 0: That's what I'm doing, but I don't think it has a chance of winning.

181
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,120
Speaker 1: Well then build a navy and attack me.

182
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,433
Speaker 0: How can I build a navy if you can just plant your navy outside my one city?

183
00:08:28,453 --> 00:08:30,280
Speaker 0: that can build a navy and kill every boat as soon as I build it?

184
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,299
Speaker 1: Put a bunch of catapults or trebuchets or whatever around that city to clear out of space.

185
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,200
Speaker 1: Because you realize, Scott.

186
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,200
Speaker 1: How can I afford all those?

187
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,960
Speaker 1: Scott, you don't seem to realize how much of a coward I actually am.

188
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,940
Speaker 1: Like, if my boat comes near you and even an archer attacks it, I just fucking run away.

189
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:49,100
Speaker 0: I mean, I've already shot a bunch of your boats with archers, but I think that's only helping you not pay for those boats.

190
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,900
Speaker 0: That you have extra boats you don't need.

191
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,400
Speaker 1: On the Ottomans, I don't pay for those boats anyway.

192
00:08:53,841 --> 00:08:58,140
Speaker 1: Also, I gifted most of those boats to a city state that's allied with me so that they'll declare war on you when I declare war.

193
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,940
Speaker 0: That's another thing, is I mostly need to travel to make trade routes with some cargo ships, right?

194
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,469
Speaker 0: I have a maximum of three trade routes.

195
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,380
Speaker 0: There's only one city state on my island.

196
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's only one city state on mine.

197
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:13,340
Speaker 0: So I can trade with one, but you can build cargo boats and they won't get- And I can trade with two and then I'm done.

198
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:21,840
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, is if I could try to get some boats out there, I could trade- Scott, you gotta use the internal routes, the internal caravans.

199
00:09:22,285 --> 00:09:23,055
Speaker 0: Yeah, with what?

200
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:23,460
Speaker 0: Myself?

201
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:23,988
Speaker 1: Yeah.

202
00:09:25,305 --> 00:09:27,080
Speaker 0: All it does is move food from one city to another.

203
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,294
Speaker 1: No, it creates food in production, Scott.

204
00:09:29,314 --> 00:09:30,019
Speaker 1: It doesn't move it.

205
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,799
Speaker 0: See, this is why I don't know stuff.

206
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,400
Speaker 1: And if you do an internal route, it's not like minus seven production here, plus seven there.

207
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,420
Speaker 1: It's there just gets plus seven.

208
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,860
Speaker 1: So if you have a crappy little city, you can point like three caravans at it and make it a production powerhouse.

209
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,759
Speaker 1: How do you think people finish wonders so quick?

210
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,753
Speaker 0: I don't know, because they know stuff like that.

211
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:48,400
Speaker 0: that I don't know.

212
00:09:48,723 --> 00:09:50,660
Speaker 1: If you ideology and go communism, right?

213
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,480
Speaker 1: You can do stuff to make those internal routes just be like twice as effective.

214
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,740
Speaker 1: You can just make hammers out of nothing.

215
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,459
Speaker 0: How do I not know this?

216
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,539
Speaker 1: I don't know how you don't know these things.

217
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,979
Speaker 0: It's too much shit in this game.

218
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,635
Speaker 0: But yeah, so- What other game has a civilopedia and it can't even have an encyclopedia.

219
00:10:07,655 --> 00:10:08,840
Speaker 0: It has to have its own media.

220
00:10:09,261 --> 00:10:10,360
Speaker 1: Europa Universalis.

221
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,375
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's even worse.

222
00:10:11,436 --> 00:10:12,399
Speaker 1: I can't- Yeah, I'm not playing that.

223
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,220
Speaker 0: I can't even play that.

224
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:13,979
Speaker 1: That's over the line.

225
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:20,720
Speaker 0: See, I can only play Netrunner, which has so many fucking cards, because I started when there were very few cards and I learned the cards one at a time.

226
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,620
Speaker 1: But I guess I'll put it this way.

227
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,279
Speaker 0: And see if I'm starting when there's like three expansions and I gotta learn everything at once.

228
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:30,717
Speaker 1: You just gotta play single player and kind of learn these things.

229
00:10:30,757 --> 00:10:31,380
Speaker 1: Try to win.

230
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,399
Speaker 0: I don't have time for this shit.

231
00:10:32,823 --> 00:10:32,972
Speaker 0: Alright.

232
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:38,340
Speaker 1: But at least what I don't think I found, because I'm in three Civ V games right now, just on GMR.

233
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,400
Speaker 1: And one of them I'm not doing great, because these guys are like super pro.

234
00:10:43,003 --> 00:10:45,880
Speaker 1: But Civ V is real fun, even when you're not winning.

235
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:52,220
Speaker 1: Because it's still Civ, except unlike against the AI, the diplomacy with the real humans actually matters a lot.

236
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,840
Speaker 1: And if there is a war, it's just awesome advanced wars.

237
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:02,798
Speaker 0: The problem is that it isn't way fun when you're losing, because the way I lose is I- Slowly peter out.

238
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:10,740
Speaker 0: No, I don't have a lot of military units and a giant army of a million guys shows up and I'm like, not only how do they build that so fast, but how are they paying for it?

239
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,660
Speaker 0: And then it destroys me in like a few turns.

240
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,549
Speaker 1: You had the same complaint in advanced wars.

241
00:11:14,569 --> 00:11:16,580
Speaker 1: I remember one time we were doing a pretty big map.

242
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:26,740
Speaker 1: And I saw you had this one motorcycle guy and he comes over and he comes over and he gets to these cities in the middle of the map that I had long ago completely captured.

243
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,860
Speaker 1: And I think you accused me of cheating because you couldn't believe I'd gotten people there that fast.

244
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,680
Speaker 0: It's the same thing that's been happening to me in games where you build stuff forever.

245
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,520
Speaker 0: When I played Red Alert back in the day, I sent a group of grenade-y guys to go scout out the enemy base.

246
00:11:39,561 --> 00:11:40,440
Speaker 1: And just tanks, tanks, tanks, tanks.

247
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,433
Speaker 0: There's like 30 tanks and meanwhile my war factory is like under construction.

248
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,560
Speaker 0: I'm like, how the fuck did you build that so fast?

249
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,668
Speaker 0: I don't understand, like, what people are doing.

250
00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:51,775
Speaker 0: Because I'm like, build archer.

251
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:52,719
Speaker 0: Alright, it will take 7 turns.

252
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:58,755
Speaker 0: And then I look over by you and you get 7 archers and I'm like, there haven't been 49 turns in this game.

253
00:11:59,137 --> 00:12:00,300
Speaker 0: How the fuck did you do that?

254
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,140
Speaker 1: I'm gonna let you in on a tiny secret.

255
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:03,292
Speaker 0: Everyone cheats but me.

256
00:12:03,393 --> 00:12:03,959
Speaker 0: Yes, I know.

257
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:14,219
Speaker 1: But I'm having a lot of fun with Civ 5 right now and this is like my game between this and Counter-Strike in the last month or two.

258
00:12:15,382 --> 00:12:18,140
Speaker 1: And I might start up a fourth or fifth Civ 5 game.

259
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,738
Speaker 0: Do whatever you want to do.

260
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:20,286
Speaker 1: Yeah.

261
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,339
Speaker 1: So you got any gaming news?

262
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:23,582
Speaker 0: I do.

263
00:12:23,662 --> 00:12:28,980
Speaker 0: So that Nintendo's iOS mobile game, the Miitomo thing.

264
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,940
Speaker 0: It's basically going to be a Mii-related candy box on your phone, pretty much.

265
00:12:33,761 --> 00:12:38,780
Speaker 0: It's gonna be out for reals in North America on Thursday.

266
00:12:39,564 --> 00:12:39,727
Speaker 0: Yes!

267
00:12:39,748 --> 00:12:40,279
Speaker 0: Candy box!

268
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,903
Speaker 0: And it's Tuesday right now.

269
00:12:42,024 --> 00:12:46,556
Speaker 0: So everybody, get your candy ready and your insulin ready.

270
00:12:46,577 --> 00:12:47,780
Speaker 0: Because it's box time.

271
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,956
Speaker 1: See, I actually did follow through with my threat to not play the 3DS candy box anymore.

272
00:12:53,016 --> 00:12:53,658
Speaker 1: I'm done.

273
00:12:53,718 --> 00:12:54,340
Speaker 1: I just don't even bother.

274
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,760
Speaker 0: I'm only doing the puzzle piece one and I have every puzzle piece.

275
00:12:57,121 --> 00:12:58,499
Speaker 1: Except there will always be more puzzles.

276
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,860
Speaker 0: They've been coming out much less frequently.

277
00:13:01,888 --> 00:13:02,734
Speaker 1: I refuse to.

278
00:13:02,754 --> 00:13:03,580
Speaker 1: I'm just done with that.

279
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:09,980
Speaker 1: Also, I don't even bring my 3DS anywhere because literally no one will play Smash Brothers or Mario Kart with me.

280
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:10,860
Speaker 1: So it's kind of pointless.

281
00:13:11,501 --> 00:13:13,040
Speaker 0: I will play a different game with you.

282
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:13,668
Speaker 1: What game?

283
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,159
Speaker 1: Advance Wars?

284
00:13:16,394 --> 00:13:16,940
Speaker 0: Uh, candy box.

285
00:13:19,962 --> 00:13:23,640
Speaker 1: It is interesting that Nintendo's finally taking these tiny baby steps into mobile.

286
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,350
Speaker 1: But I feel like the long run will be.

287
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,380
Speaker 1: they'll just be a software company on mobile.

288
00:13:30,823 --> 00:13:33,560
Speaker 1: And have some sort of console that maybe also interacts with mobile.

289
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,010
Speaker 0: No, the NX is going to be real.

290
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:35,635
Speaker 0: I feel it.

291
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,380
Speaker 0: The NX is going to be super legit.

292
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,380
Speaker 1: But what form will it take?

293
00:13:41,382 --> 00:13:43,148
Speaker 0: Not the form of those amazing fakes.

294
00:13:43,229 --> 00:13:44,694
Speaker 0: Bravo amazing fake people.

295
00:13:44,754 --> 00:13:45,256
Speaker 0: Great job.

296
00:13:45,296 --> 00:13:46,119
Speaker 0: You did the best fake.

297
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,530
Speaker 0: I've seen every fake there is to see.

298
00:13:48,631 --> 00:13:50,040
Speaker 0: I've been around as long as the internet.

299
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,259
Speaker 0: And that is the best fake I ever did see.

300
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,014
Speaker 1: The beautiful thing is when the person posted their.

301
00:13:56,054 --> 00:13:57,199
Speaker 0: here's how I faked it.

302
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:04,080
Speaker 0: If there was internet awards you would get the achievement, the best achievement of the year award.

303
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,659
Speaker 1: But when they posted the here's how I did it, if I'd done it.

304
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,396
Speaker 1: There were replies and comments and discussions about that post claiming that the I faked.

305
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,720
Speaker 1: it post was fake.

306
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,073
Speaker 1: And that's covering up the fact that it's real.

307
00:14:17,154 --> 00:14:18,040
Speaker 1: Which is amazing.

308
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,679
Speaker 0: That's how good that fake was.

309
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:23,340
Speaker 0: Also, it was so believable because the patent wasn't fake.

310
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:24,986
Speaker 1: Which is smart.

311
00:14:25,006 --> 00:14:28,880
Speaker 1: You gotta go find a patent like that and base your fake on the patent.

312
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,067
Speaker 0: Now you know what?

313
00:14:31,127 --> 00:14:31,709
Speaker 0: It's not a hunt.

314
00:14:31,729 --> 00:14:32,231
Speaker 0: You know what?

315
00:14:32,312 --> 00:14:34,480
Speaker 0: Those people were saying it's a cover up.

316
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,232
Speaker 0: I'll give them a tiny percent chance that it actually wasn't fake.

317
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:40,280
Speaker 0: and they were trying to cover up by saying it was fake.

318
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,979
Speaker 1: The ultimate beauty would be if it was a fake.

319
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,480
Speaker 0: Nintendo did it to test the waters.

320
00:14:46,461 --> 00:14:47,826
Speaker 1: Or what if it was a fake?

321
00:14:48,428 --> 00:14:52,060
Speaker 1: but that is actually what the real thing is going to look like mostly.

322
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:52,798
Speaker 0: So it could be.

323
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,743
Speaker 1: That could happen.

324
00:14:53,763 --> 00:14:57,840
Speaker 1: I mean, if there's a couple of smart choices that could be made.

325
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:03,420
Speaker 1: There's a lot of smart people in the world so odds are a few smart people would come up with the same solution to a problem.

326
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:07,120
Speaker 1: In other news, this is actually kind of a big deal.

327
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,640
Speaker 1: So Pax East, I love Pax but it is the worst of the Pax's.

328
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,733
Speaker 1: Now that's like saying this is the worst of the foie gras.

329
00:15:14,773 --> 00:15:16,460
Speaker 1: This is the worst of the king's peas.

330
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,620
Speaker 0: This is the least tasty filet mignon.

331
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:25,318
Speaker 1: But Pax East is the hardest to go to in terms of local logistics because there's like...

332
00:15:26,124 --> 00:15:27,439
Speaker 0: There's no place to eat.

333
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,835
Speaker 1: There's like three hotels within walking distance that are comfortable.

334
00:15:30,855 --> 00:15:31,900
Speaker 1: The rest are super far away.

335
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,020
Speaker 0: It's more expensive to go there even though we live in New York very close to Pax East than it is to go to Pax South which is very far away.

336
00:15:39,941 --> 00:15:41,037
Speaker 1: And one of the big problems is...

337
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:47,160
Speaker 0: Pax Australia is cheaper than Pax East if you live in Australia and Pax Prime is cheaper than Pax East if you live near Pax Prime.

338
00:15:47,827 --> 00:15:48,312
Speaker 0: West.

339
00:15:48,372 --> 00:15:49,019
Speaker 0: They changed the name.

340
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,348
Speaker 1: Which is interesting.

341
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,520
Speaker 1: Don't wait for Pax North.

342
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,400
Speaker 1: There's also rumors of all those tabletop events they might start.

343
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:02,859
Speaker 0: Well they sent out a survey that was like "How would you like if we had Pax branded tabletop events that were as much smaller than Pax in random

344
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:03,180
Speaker 0: places?".

345
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,517
Speaker 0: And I was like "I will make it my job to run those and travel around the country doing

346
00:16:07,578 --> 00:16:07,698
Speaker 0: that.".

347
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:23,000
Speaker 1: So with Pax Prime and Pax East, but not so much with Pax South, and actually not at all really at least in the ones I went to with Pax Aus, a lot of people just show up Thursday morning and just game in the hotel lobbies like all day and all night.

348
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,020
Speaker 0: That's every Pax ever.

349
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,676
Speaker 1: Pax South there was not nearly as much.

350
00:16:26,818 --> 00:16:29,139
Speaker 0: but... I think we just weren't going to the hotels that had it.

351
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,740
Speaker 1: Well the thing is the hotels were a lot more spread out.

352
00:16:32,202 --> 00:16:35,460
Speaker 1: In Pax Prime, the Sheraton is the hotel.

353
00:16:37,065 --> 00:16:38,418
Speaker 1: If you can get into the Sheraton...

354
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,540
Speaker 0: Right, but we go to Pax Prime, even if we're not staying in the Sheraton, we go in the Sheraton.

355
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:49,660
Speaker 0: At Pax South, I think that Marriott across the street from the convention center is the hotel and we've never even walked inside of it.

356
00:16:49,822 --> 00:16:50,440
Speaker 0: I walked in there.

357
00:16:50,561 --> 00:16:51,139
Speaker 0: I never went in it.

358
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:54,600
Speaker 1: The problem with that hotel is that there's not that much tablespace.

359
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,539
Speaker 0: I haven't been in it.

360
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,898
Speaker 1: There's not a lot of room in there.

361
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,480
Speaker 1: But Pax Prime, the Sheraton, it's a whole convention just going on in that lobby.

362
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,392
Speaker 0: Well, part of the convention is in the Sheraton.

363
00:17:03,412 --> 00:17:04,660
Speaker 0: The real convention is in there.

364
00:17:05,222 --> 00:17:06,640
Speaker 0: There's rooms, panel rooms in there.

365
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:11,359
Speaker 1: And if you go to Pax East, the Westin lobby is enormous and there's a million people in there playing games.

366
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,339
Speaker 1: Like so crowded.

367
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:17,260
Speaker 0: It even has that little balcony mezzanine area with extra big round tables that are used for gaming.

368
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:21,780
Speaker 1: But it's so crowded, like I avoid that place like the plague for the last few years.

369
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,560
Speaker 1: So it's always been a problem because there's nowhere for everyone to game on Thursday except there.

370
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:31,240
Speaker 1: Like you go over to the Seaport Hotel, despite having a ton of space, there's like no one playing games.

371
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:31,924
Speaker 0: Well, it's also.

372
00:17:32,065 --> 00:17:34,560
Speaker 0: a lot of these hotel lobbies aren't convenient for gaming.

373
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,900
Speaker 0: Hotel lobby tables are usually tiny weird circle tables or low coffee tables for newspapers and shit.

374
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,060
Speaker 1: But there's multiple factors.

375
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, no one has gaming tables set up in there, right?

376
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:50,500
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm pretty sure like random poker games would break out when it's not a nerd convention.

377
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:59,340
Speaker 1: But there's also the sort of like consensus critical mass where you need a... Like you have to have a certain critical mass of nerds who want to play games and then the hotel will be rocking.

378
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,180
Speaker 1: If you're below that, it's just really sad unless you have your own small group of friends to just play games with.

379
00:18:05,341 --> 00:18:05,699
Speaker 0: We have that.

380
00:18:06,342 --> 00:18:10,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then it's just like you're in your hotel room except it's slightly bigger.

381
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:18,500
Speaker 1: So PAX East for the first time ever is solving this problem in the Westin.

382
00:18:18,821 --> 00:18:20,459
Speaker 0: The big hotel that everyone wants to stay in.

383
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,099
Speaker 1: That no attendees are staying in as far as I can tell.

384
00:18:23,722 --> 00:18:24,539
Speaker 1: It's all exhibitors.

385
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,719
Speaker 1: I mean, we could not even get into the stupid Westin.

386
00:18:28,225 --> 00:18:29,139
Speaker 0: No, because we're so special.

387
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:36,660
Speaker 1: Well, enforcers and panelists and all the early access gave us no access to that stupid hotel.

388
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:42,560
Speaker 1: We could have stayed in the Westin if there was one of us and we were only staying Friday and Saturday.

389
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,400
Speaker 1: So there's a big event space, 21,000 square feet in the basement of that hotel that PAX never used.

390
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,259
Speaker 1: Like no one uses it.

391
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,180
Speaker 0: I mean, I thought I was imagining this space because I've been down the stairs in the Westin.

392
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a hallway there.

393
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,540
Speaker 0: We played a lot of Wizard down there in the restaurant part, but there's another room down there and stuff.

394
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,740
Speaker 0: And I thought that that was the space.

395
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,440
Speaker 1: Wait, Scott, the restaurant part is like up and around to the right.

396
00:19:08,741 --> 00:19:09,937
Speaker 0: There's a space down the stairs.

397
00:19:09,957 --> 00:19:10,140
Speaker 0: Remember?

398
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just a wide hallway.

399
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,760
Speaker 0: No, because there were like lights that were shining on the wall with like graphics and stuff down there.

400
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's just a long hallway.

401
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,060
Speaker 0: Anyway, there's stuff down there.

402
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:22,100
Speaker 1: That's where we played Vampire Rob Mafia that one day.

403
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,719
Speaker 0: I'm just saying is apparently this space is not a space that is in my brain.

404
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,080
Speaker 0: Because it's some other space I haven't been to.

405
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:28,884
Speaker 1: It's a ballroom.

406
00:19:28,944 --> 00:19:29,990
Speaker 1: It's an expo hall.

407
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:30,814
Speaker 1: It's 21,000 square feet.

408
00:19:33,401 --> 00:19:37,995
Speaker 1: And for whatever reason, the hotel said, "Hey, PAX people, you can just use it.

409
00:19:38,015 --> 00:19:38,938
Speaker 1: We're not even going to charge

410
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:39,058
Speaker 1: you.".

411
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,958
Speaker 0: Are you sure they're not charging anyone for this?

412
00:19:42,341 --> 00:19:50,753
Speaker 1: It appears that they're not charging anyone for this because there's an interesting quote, "Zero gaming will be allowed in the actual hotel lobby anywhere.

413
00:19:50,793 --> 00:19:52,659
Speaker 1: You will be forced to go to this gaming

414
00:19:52,739 --> 00:19:52,940
Speaker 1: area.".

415
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:59,560
Speaker 1: The hotel is trying to get the thousands of PAX people who crowd their lobby every year out of their hair.

416
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:04,040
Speaker 0: I mean, usually like other hotels, for example, share it in at PAX West, right?

417
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,020
Speaker 0: It's like, if that bothers them, they haven't done anything about it.

418
00:20:08,463 --> 00:20:09,960
Speaker 0: I don't understand why the hotel cares.

419
00:20:10,061 --> 00:20:12,600
Speaker 0: Like, why is the hotel being nice and helping us out?

420
00:20:13,162 --> 00:20:15,012
Speaker 0: It's sort of like, "Really?

421
00:20:15,033 --> 00:20:16,079
Speaker 0: You're helping us out,

422
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:16,280
Speaker 0: huh?".

423
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:23,240
Speaker 1: Well, as far as I can tell, the mezzanine, which is in that area, some other convention has that space rented out on Thursday.

424
00:20:23,661 --> 00:20:24,459
Speaker 0: That's dumb of them.

425
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:33,630
Speaker 1: And those people, there might have been trouble because that space that they've rented out last year was full of probably seven or eight hundred PAX.

426
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,800
Speaker 1: people like mashed together, sitting on the floor everywhere.

427
00:20:37,342 --> 00:20:44,800
Speaker 1: So the hotel will fucking kick you out if you don't go downstairs to play games in the dungeon, but the dungeon is going to be gigantic.

428
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:49,919
Speaker 0: It's like, we want the dungeon, but this still is making me very cautious.

429
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:56,530
Speaker 0: Like, when you go down the street and there's a guy and he's handing out some candy, and you're like, "Really?

430
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,896
Speaker 0: That's not poison candy.

431
00:20:57,936 --> 00:20:58,458
Speaker 0: Is that what you're

432
00:20:58,478 --> 00:20:58,779
Speaker 0: saying?".

433
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:03,716
Speaker 1: The ones I don't get lately, there's all these people in my office that are just like, "Free massage, free

434
00:21:03,737 --> 00:21:03,920
Speaker 1: massage.".

435
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,684
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "Hell no.

436
00:21:06,126 --> 00:21:09,998
Speaker 1: Hell no, you're not touching me, scary hobo-looking dude with a

437
00:21:10,038 --> 00:21:10,379
Speaker 1: sign.".

438
00:21:10,643 --> 00:21:11,139
Speaker 0: That's right.

439
00:21:11,381 --> 00:21:15,320
Speaker 0: They're trying to convince you to come in for their paid massage or their Chinese...

440
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,700
Speaker 1: And it's a hobo that was hired by the whatever.

441
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:22,880
Speaker 0: Or their Chinese nonsense or their chiropractors or whatever their evil nonsense is.

442
00:21:23,362 --> 00:21:28,140
Speaker 1: So at least 350 seats with a bunch of tables, also tons of floor space.

443
00:21:28,381 --> 00:21:31,160
Speaker 1: They're setting up JS Joust and you can just game on the floor.

444
00:21:31,761 --> 00:21:34,639
Speaker 1: They're trying to get a bar put down there.

445
00:21:34,941 --> 00:21:37,580
Speaker 0: I'm sure the hotel will be happy with putting a bar down there.

446
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,680
Speaker 1: I'll be happy if they put a bar down there.

447
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,739
Speaker 0: Free money for them.

448
00:21:40,461 --> 00:21:48,920
Speaker 1: So this is going to be amazing and this actually really ups the value of PAX East in relation to the other PAXes.

449
00:21:49,261 --> 00:21:49,494
Speaker 0: Sure, yeah.

450
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,300
Speaker 1: Because Prime's the only other PAX that has...

451
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,160
Speaker 0: If they kept it going every night after the end of PAX, that would be even better.

452
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,550
Speaker 0: If they turned it into... Because this is a Thursday night thing.

453
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,940
Speaker 0: Is it going to be a Friday night thing?

454
00:22:01,145 --> 00:22:02,220
Speaker 1: I think it's just Thursday because...

455
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,740
Speaker 0: When does PAX end on Friday?

456
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:08,480
Speaker 1: Well, because I'm pretty sure on Friday the mezzanine and everything will be available again.

457
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:08,923
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

458
00:22:08,983 --> 00:22:11,300
Speaker 0: But the mezzanine doesn't hold nearly as much as a giant ballroom.

459
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,340
Speaker 1: Thursday is the most important though because the other news, as far as I can tell...

460
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,340
Speaker 0: It is the most important.

461
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,019
Speaker 1: Because, you know, Wizards of the Coast isn't...

462
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,680
Speaker 0: But so is Sunday after the con ends.

463
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:23,340
Speaker 1: Wizards of the Coast isn't exhibiting and taking up all the space that they always take up, at least in the tabletop areas.

464
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,920
Speaker 0: That is correct, but we don't know if that space will be used for more tabletop or not.

465
00:22:27,521 --> 00:22:32,080
Speaker 1: I suspect there's going to be a lot more tabletop space at this PAX East than there's ever been.

466
00:22:32,382 --> 00:22:33,240
Speaker 0: Maybe, that would be nice.

467
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,120
Speaker 1: Independent of the Westin stuff.

468
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,217
Speaker 0: But they could expand other areas to take that WotC space instead.

469
00:22:38,258 --> 00:22:38,600
Speaker 0: We don't know.

470
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,366
Speaker 1: Yeah.

471
00:22:39,386 --> 00:22:40,340
Speaker 1: So I got one last news.

472
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:46,160
Speaker 0: But I think they shouldn't because just because WotC's not there doesn't mean there won't be an equal number of people playing Magic.

473
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,300
Speaker 1: True, but the only reason those Magic people are in our way is because that space is reserved for them.

474
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:59,200
Speaker 0: Right, but what I'm saying is that if WotC doesn't show up, you're still going to need all those tables to accommodate people playing Magic on their own.

475
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,440
Speaker 1: But as soon as they stand up, my Carcassonne game starts there.

476
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:02,848
Speaker 0: Sure.

477
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:06,220
Speaker 1: One last little news because this is kind of hilarious.

478
00:23:07,401 --> 00:23:11,020
Speaker 1: Someone hacked Steam and there was a way to use their API.

479
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,773
Speaker 0: And Steam is like a really bad thing.

480
00:23:12,853 --> 00:23:13,800
Speaker 0: It's really garbage anyway.

481
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,063
Speaker 1: No, but this was an interesting hack.

482
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:20,213
Speaker 1: They basically were able to list a game in Steam that you could buy.

483
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:23,300
Speaker 1: that literally no one at Valve knew about or had looked at.

484
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:24,980
Speaker 0: Whoa, that's pretty crazy.

485
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,700
Speaker 1: So it was a security researcher who did it and he did it as a joke.

486
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:33,260
Speaker 1: He was going to have the game appear on April Fool's Day and the game is called Watch Paint Dry.

487
00:23:34,423 --> 00:23:36,600
Speaker 1: And it's basically just paint drying.

488
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,183
Speaker 0: I'm telling you, Valve, hire me.

489
00:23:38,223 --> 00:23:43,138
Speaker 0: I'm going to redo all of Steam so that when you click on your inventory, it'll load instantly and won't be like...

490
00:23:44,244 --> 00:23:46,340
Speaker 1: Why would I even want to ever click on my inventory?

491
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,969
Speaker 0: I'm just saying there's so much shit in Steam.

492
00:23:48,989 --> 00:23:50,837
Speaker 0: Because Steam is basically just a website, right?

493
00:23:50,857 --> 00:23:51,620
Speaker 0: Which is what I can make.

494
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,906
Speaker 0: And it's really awful, right?

495
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:57,820
Speaker 0: The Steam app is mostly just a browser with this website in it.

496
00:23:58,362 --> 00:24:03,120
Speaker 0: And the website's real bad and it's real slow and I think it's all Microsoft-based actually on the back end.

497
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:08,320
Speaker 0: I could just rewrite that whole fucking thing, especially with a team of great Valve developers.

498
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:14,960
Speaker 0: Well, maybe their web developers aren't so great, but I get some other ones, redo that whole thing, and it would be amazing.

499
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:23,920
Speaker 0: And I'm sure that people also, the people who are game developers and publishers, putting their games on Steam have to deal with a lot of web interfaces and stuff that really suck.

500
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,700
Speaker 0: That I could also improve.

501
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:31,278
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, our friend Conrad has complained every time he's ever had to interact with Steam on the back end, so...

502
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,001
Speaker 0: Yep.

503
00:24:32,723 --> 00:24:36,015
Speaker 0: Valve is just bad at the back end things.

504
00:24:36,095 --> 00:24:37,078
Speaker 0: It all started...

505
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,608
Speaker 1: Well, are they bad at it?

506
00:24:38,628 --> 00:24:40,240
Speaker 1: Because they do a better job than anyone else.

507
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,500
Speaker 0: Or they just don't care, right?

508
00:24:42,121 --> 00:24:43,620
Speaker 1: Who does a good job on this stuff?

509
00:24:44,062 --> 00:24:45,060
Speaker 0: No one else is doing this stuff.

510
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:50,040
Speaker 1: No, I'm saying who does a good job on this sort of web front end, back end type stuff anywhere?

511
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:50,720
Speaker 1: WordPress.

512
00:24:51,081 --> 00:24:52,179
Speaker 0: Alright, we got one.

513
00:24:52,722 --> 00:24:57,280
Speaker 0: Any sort of, you know, thing that you would set up, like, you know, GitHub or, you know...

514
00:24:57,342 --> 00:24:57,859
Speaker 1: No, they're okay.

515
00:24:58,781 --> 00:25:01,099
Speaker 0: Amazon web services is much better than Steam.

516
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,500
Speaker 1: The Amazon console is really, of course, that's more bad UX.

517
00:25:03,621 --> 00:25:04,819
Speaker 0: I'm just saying it's better than Steam.

518
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,476
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

519
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,064
Speaker 0: It's better than Steam.

520
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:07,012
Speaker 0: It works, right?

521
00:25:07,092 --> 00:25:08,060
Speaker 0: It's not some, you know...

522
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:08,725
Speaker 1: It does work.

523
00:25:08,766 --> 00:25:10,480
Speaker 1: Of course, I haven't had problems with Steam in a while.

524
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,696
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, it's, you know, it's not like some weird slow-loading pages and shit, right?

525
00:25:14,756 --> 00:25:15,640
Speaker 0: It's way better than Steam.

526
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,060
Speaker 0: Things of the day!

527
00:25:24,301 --> 00:25:24,840
Speaker 0: What was my thing?

528
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,732
Speaker 1: Scott found this independent of me.

529
00:25:26,772 --> 00:25:27,798
Speaker 1: He messaged it to me, like, "Holy

530
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:28,040
Speaker 1: crap!".

531
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,460
Speaker 1: But I'd already, like, flagged it as my thing of the day.

532
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,655
Speaker 0: I was just using it to sort of make some trash talk.

533
00:25:34,675 --> 00:25:36,160
Speaker 0: that's definitely not going to actually happen.

534
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,320
Speaker 0: Because, as we know already, I suck at civilization.

535
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,435
Speaker 0: But I was like, "It's about a Bronze Age

536
00:25:40,476 --> 00:25:40,819
Speaker 0: battle.".

537
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,680
Speaker 0: And Rym, in the two-player game we're playing, Rym is Egypt and I'm China.

538
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,753
Speaker 0: So I'm like, "See that skull with the spear in it?

539
00:25:50,094 --> 00:25:51,458
Speaker 0: That's gonna be Ramsay's real

540
00:25:51,498 --> 00:25:51,779
Speaker 0: soon.".

541
00:25:52,001 --> 00:25:53,554
Speaker 0: "In his crystal ball, this is what he

542
00:25:53,614 --> 00:25:54,098
Speaker 0: sees.".

543
00:25:54,463 --> 00:25:55,359
Speaker 1: Are you threatening me?

544
00:25:56,603 --> 00:25:58,080
Speaker 0: I'm just being silly threatening you.

545
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,023
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go at the beginning of this.

546
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:04,220
Speaker 1: In 1996, an amateur archaeologist found a single upper arm bone sticking out of a riverbank.

547
00:26:04,644 --> 00:26:04,960
Speaker 0: Alright.

548
00:26:06,262 --> 00:26:06,939
Speaker 1: Blah, blah, blah.

549
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,276
Speaker 1: A flint arrowhead was firmly embedded in one end of the bone.

550
00:26:10,336 --> 00:26:11,020
Speaker 1: It was a really good picture.

551
00:26:11,241 --> 00:26:15,054
Speaker 0: So that tells you basically immediately, "This isn't some recent murder that I'm worried about.

552
00:26:15,095 --> 00:26:15,917
Speaker 0: This is an old-ass

553
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:16,279
Speaker 0: bone.".

554
00:26:16,981 --> 00:26:18,587
Speaker 1: Or, maybe someone in 1910 was like, "You know what?

555
00:26:18,607 --> 00:26:18,728
Speaker 1: Flint

556
00:26:18,768 --> 00:26:19,029
Speaker 1: arrowheads.".

557
00:26:24,043 --> 00:26:24,987
Speaker 1: And they thought, "Alright.

558
00:26:25,449 --> 00:26:26,352
Speaker 1: Murder something.

559
00:26:26,412 --> 00:26:27,376
Speaker 1: Maybe a small battle.

560
00:26:27,396 --> 00:26:27,818
Speaker 1: We'll figure it

561
00:26:27,918 --> 00:26:27,999
Speaker 1: out.".

562
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:35,558
Speaker 1: But they found evidence of a massive organized battle from at least 3,000 years ago.

563
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:38,247
Speaker 0: So they found this in 1910, so 3,000 years ago.

564
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:40,562
Speaker 0: No, no.

565
00:26:40,582 --> 00:26:42,031
Speaker 1: They found this in 1996.

566
00:26:42,031 --> 00:26:43,400
Speaker 1: I was saying it was a 100-year-old murder.

567
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:44,181
Speaker 0: Oh.

568
00:26:44,201 --> 00:26:48,621
Speaker 0: So 1996 minus 3,000 is... 1250 BC.

569
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:49,904
Speaker 0: BC.

570
00:26:50,441 --> 00:26:50,565
Speaker 0: BCE.

571
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,223
Speaker 1: Way old.

572
00:26:52,745 --> 00:26:52,820
Speaker 0: Yup.

573
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,505
Speaker 0: Mad old.

574
00:26:53,566 --> 00:26:54,777
Speaker 0: Like, not medieval times.

575
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,407
Speaker 0: Sick old.

576
00:26:56,488 --> 00:26:57,319
Speaker 0: Bronze age.

577
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,640
Speaker 1: This is interesting.

578
00:26:58,961 --> 00:26:59,316
Speaker 1: Bronze.

579
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:08,080
Speaker 1: Because there is literally no recorded evidence, no circumstantial evidence, no references, nothing.

580
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:17,700
Speaker 1: Indicating that humanity knew anything about a battle, significant civilizations, anything in that region, even remotely close to that era.

581
00:27:18,582 --> 00:27:21,617
Speaker 1: And at first they thought, "Well, maybe there was a bunch of battles here over a long period of

582
00:27:21,637 --> 00:27:21,919
Speaker 1: time.".

583
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,131
Speaker 0: Were they sure it was people?

584
00:27:24,151 --> 00:27:25,600
Speaker 0: They sure it wasn't like a Neanderthal war?

585
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,740
Speaker 1: It's definitely people.

586
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,719
Speaker 0: It wasn't a monkey war?

587
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,580
Speaker 1: Definitely people.

588
00:27:29,002 --> 00:27:29,256
Speaker 0: Elephant war?

589
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:33,779
Speaker 1: They found a lot of well-constructed bronze weapons, which in that era...

590
00:27:34,061 --> 00:27:34,637
Speaker 0: Alien war?

591
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:42,040
Speaker 1: The bronze weapons in this time period would have been like the cream of the crop, like experimental weapons effectively.

592
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,155
Speaker 1: And it was definitely armed conflicts.

593
00:27:46,175 --> 00:27:47,080
Speaker 1: Organized armed conflicts.

594
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,969
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean this arrowhead stuck in bones.

595
00:27:48,989 --> 00:27:51,300
Speaker 0: That's a pretty sick arrowhead if you can get it all the way down to the bones.

596
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:59,500
Speaker 1: But there is a big difference between armed conflict, like it could be a bunch of farmers fighting over whatever, and organized armies armed conflicts.

597
00:27:59,540 --> 00:27:59,661
Speaker 1: Right.

598
00:27:59,822 --> 00:28:01,792
Speaker 0: It's not a plowshare that was stuck in a dude's head.

599
00:28:02,054 --> 00:28:02,838
Speaker 0: It was an arrowhead.

600
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:03,781
Speaker 1: Yup.

601
00:28:03,921 --> 00:28:08,580
Speaker 1: One side definitely won because they found that basically all the bodies that would have been accessible were looted.

602
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:13,859
Speaker 1: And all the ones that were buried deep in water had a whole bunch of jewelry and stuff on them.

603
00:28:15,641 --> 00:28:25,720
Speaker 1: And this article is just really fascinating because as much as we think we know about history, occasionally we find things like this that kind of blow up our whole perception of the history of the world.

604
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,489
Speaker 0: Also, the photos here are sick.

605
00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:29,540
Speaker 0: Like the dude's skull with the spear stuck in it.

606
00:28:29,901 --> 00:28:30,062
Speaker 1: Yeah.

607
00:28:30,524 --> 00:28:33,840
Speaker 1: I do not ever want a flint arrowhead to be embedded that deeply into my arm bone.

608
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,903
Speaker 0: Yeah, listen guys.

609
00:28:35,184 --> 00:28:41,200
Speaker 0: Everyone who's currently doing some Civil War reenacting, I'm sure in Europe they do some Bronze Age battle reenacting.

610
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,380
Speaker 0: And then we can find out who the people in Europe are who are the types that would reenact.

611
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,943
Speaker 0: So this gets even crazier.

612
00:28:47,504 --> 00:28:56,520
Speaker 1: They look at this thing and they're like, well maybe there's a bunch of conflicts over a long period of time, but based on the evidence at the site, no, it was one gigantic battle.

613
00:28:57,162 --> 00:28:59,709
Speaker 1: And then in 2013 they found a 120 meter long bridge used to be there.

614
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:13,400
Speaker 1: So this was a giant battle over a gigantic bridge from a time and a place where we really didn't think there were organized people.

615
00:29:13,801 --> 00:29:15,718
Speaker 0: And we didn't think people knew how to make a bridge.

616
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,675
Speaker 1: I mean, let alone just, there's so much going on in this article.

617
00:29:20,695 --> 00:29:21,939
Speaker 0: This is amazing.

618
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,820
Speaker 0: I'm sure this is real and not one of those people making a fake discovery to be famous with bullshit.

619
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,038
Speaker 1: Nah, this seems pretty legit.

620
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,980
Speaker 0: There's a lot of fraud in archaeology, right?

621
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,322
Speaker 1: Yeah, that has happened.

622
00:29:31,522 --> 00:29:41,360
Speaker 1: Here, quote, standardized metal weaponry and the remains of horses, which were found intermingled with human bones at one spot, suggest there are at least some combatants that were well equipped, well trained.

623
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,732
Speaker 1: Quote, these weren't farmer soldiers who went out every few years for a brawl.

624
00:29:46,314 --> 00:29:48,240
Speaker 1: These are professional fighters.

625
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:56,040
Speaker 1: So I'm really curious to see what we can figure out from this as they start to continue to study this site.

626
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:03,220
Speaker 1: And it kind of raises interesting questions about how old the civilizations in Europe really are.

627
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,099
Speaker 0: Because, you know, sick old.

628
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:14,080
Speaker 1: Well, you know, the guns, germs and steel thing, the idea that the animals in Europe and the climate just happened to be more usable by humans, which gave Europe a head start.

629
00:30:14,582 --> 00:30:20,040
Speaker 1: The counter theory to that is that humans were just in Europe a lot longer than we thought and made it that way.

630
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,909
Speaker 0: Well, sorry, guns, germs and steel.

631
00:30:21,969 --> 00:30:23,560
Speaker 0: Evidence is not helping you out.

632
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,021
Speaker 1: Yep.

633
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:26,159
Speaker 1: So, yeah, this is really cool stuff.

634
00:30:26,961 --> 00:30:27,122
Speaker 0: Yeah.

635
00:30:27,222 --> 00:30:28,486
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, why was Europe better?

636
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:29,188
Speaker 0: I don't know.

637
00:30:30,271 --> 00:30:33,140
Speaker 0: They built bridges while everyone else was still like, you know, cave people.

638
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:33,681
Speaker 1: Yeah.

639
00:30:33,982 --> 00:30:37,820
Speaker 1: Why did so much military force conversion a narrow river valley in northern Germany?

640
00:30:38,061 --> 00:30:38,799
Speaker 0: It was a bridge there.

641
00:30:39,081 --> 00:30:39,281
Speaker 1: Yeah.

642
00:30:39,321 --> 00:30:42,549
Speaker 1: This is a period of significant upheaval in the Mediterranean to the Baltic.

643
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:46,760
Speaker 1: In Greece, the Mycenaean civilization was collapsing around the time of the battle.

644
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,878
Speaker 1: Mycenaeans, man.

645
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,558
Speaker 0: That's my people.

646
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,020
Speaker 1: Yeah.

647
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:54,014
Speaker 1: In Egypt, pharaohs boasted about having defeated the sea people.

648
00:30:54,295 --> 00:30:55,660
Speaker 1: So it's during all those times.

649
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,480
Speaker 0: Cyclopians.

650
00:30:57,743 --> 00:30:57,823
Speaker 1: Yeah.

651
00:30:58,264 --> 00:30:59,449
Speaker 1: Unknown horrors of the deep.

652
00:31:00,151 --> 00:31:02,640
Speaker 1: So you got a thing of the day?

653
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,565
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do have a thing.

654
00:31:03,605 --> 00:31:05,840
Speaker 0: So this is sort of like a mainstream thing of the day.

655
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:10,759
Speaker 0: It was all over like the trash news in, you know, basically the New York Post of the U.K.

656
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,040
Speaker 1: It's like basic story.

657
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:12,501
Speaker 0: Yeah.

658
00:31:12,822 --> 00:31:16,980
Speaker 0: But I think this is something not a lot of nerds have seen because it was all over the mainstream Internet.

659
00:31:17,101 --> 00:31:17,988
Speaker 0: And it's really cool.

660
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:19,539
Speaker 0: Even if you don't care about sports here.

661
00:31:19,941 --> 00:31:20,476
Speaker 1: I have not seen this.

662
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,001
Speaker 0: Yeah.

663
00:31:21,061 --> 00:31:21,865
Speaker 0: Here is a dude.

664
00:31:22,266 --> 00:31:24,617
Speaker 0: He's a 50 year old fisherman, which is pretty cool.

665
00:31:24,737 --> 00:31:25,300
Speaker 0: You know, fisherman.

666
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,000
Speaker 0: It's a good thing to be.

667
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,825
Speaker 0: If you're like a professional fisherman, that's cool.

668
00:31:28,727 --> 00:31:31,696
Speaker 0: But he's sort of fat and blobby, you know, but he's not so fat and blobby.

669
00:31:31,716 --> 00:31:32,498
Speaker 0: He can't get around.

670
00:31:32,518 --> 00:31:33,240
Speaker 0: He's just fat and blobby.

671
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,560
Speaker 1: He can really get around.

672
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:37,506
Speaker 0: And he can fucking get around with the soccer ball.

673
00:31:37,526 --> 00:31:38,428
Speaker 0: Let me tell you what.

674
00:31:38,589 --> 00:31:39,351
Speaker 0: Like, whoa.

675
00:31:39,491 --> 00:31:42,398
Speaker 0: Like, the skills are so high with this dude.

676
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:43,160
Speaker 0: It's ridiculous.

677
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:53,300
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, it's sort of like when you see like that, you know, people are always shocked to see like an ugly person sing because usually in the music industry, they only let pretty people sing.

678
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,100
Speaker 0: Right.

679
00:31:54,301 --> 00:31:55,543
Speaker 0: No, this is like that.

680
00:31:55,623 --> 00:32:03,880
Speaker 0: It's like usually you only see fit people doing athletics because, you know, you think how only fit people can do this like this is probably mad fit underneath all that blubber.

681
00:32:04,481 --> 00:32:08,247
Speaker 0: But he's got the mad coordination and skills and it's awesome to watch him.

682
00:32:08,588 --> 00:32:15,540
Speaker 0: And I hope maybe he could like, you know, get fit and then he could be a soccer player because he obviously likes playing soccer.

683
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:17,340
Speaker 0: So maybe he could be a soccer player and a fisherman.

684
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:24,900
Speaker 1: Also, there was that TED talk a while ago and a bunch of research backing it showing that like it's better to be skinnier, like it's better to not be obese.

685
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,525
Speaker 1: Like if you can just don't be fat.

686
00:32:26,966 --> 00:32:32,100
Speaker 1: But if you're already fat, well, it's really, really difficult to unfat.

687
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,583
Speaker 1: And for some people, it might be impossible.

688
00:32:34,204 --> 00:32:42,120
Speaker 1: if you're fit, like if you're physically fit and you exercise, even if you remain fat, you're like 95 percent as healthy as someone who's that fit and skinny.

689
00:32:42,241 --> 00:32:43,909
Speaker 1: Like you're doing pretty well.

690
00:32:43,949 --> 00:32:46,000
Speaker 1: If you can move around, this guy's probably doing all right.

691
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,523
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, this is you can always tell.

692
00:32:48,764 --> 00:32:49,084
Speaker 0: Right.

693
00:32:49,484 --> 00:33:01,600
Speaker 0: You know, you see like really large, obese type people, the ones that are like a ton of muscle and, you know, that just happens to have fat around it, like the bouncer at the nightclub where it's like fucking with that guy.

694
00:33:02,081 --> 00:33:02,282
Speaker 0: Right.

695
00:33:02,362 --> 00:33:05,960
Speaker 0: And then the person who's in the rover, whatever thing can walk.

696
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:13,560
Speaker 1: Well, even though they might weigh the same like NFL, the fat guy in the NFL, he would kill either one of us if he was in the same room and mad at us.

697
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:13,781
Speaker 0: Yeah.

698
00:33:13,821 --> 00:33:15,067
Speaker 0: You know, I think B.J.

699
00:33:15,107 --> 00:33:17,439
Speaker 0: Raji just retired, but it's like, yeah, you're fucking with B.J.

700
00:33:19,341 --> 00:33:19,727
Speaker 0: B.J.,

701
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:20,499
Speaker 0: what's up?

702
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,712
Speaker 1: In the moment we're going we were just at Anime Boston.

703
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:24,214
Speaker 1: Stay tuned.

704
00:33:24,234 --> 00:33:25,400
Speaker 1: I'll try to get videos up soon.

705
00:33:26,001 --> 00:33:30,953
Speaker 1: For those of you who care about Kinetic Con, I finally can open panel submissions.

706
00:33:31,013 --> 00:33:33,940
Speaker 1: The secret is the form's already open, but I haven't tested it yet.

707
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,946
Speaker 1: So I'm going to futz around with it and I'm going to announce stuff.

708
00:33:36,006 --> 00:33:37,992
Speaker 1: But go ahead and submit now if you want.

709
00:33:38,013 --> 00:33:40,280
Speaker 1: If you're listening to Geek Nights, you know the drill.

710
00:33:41,401 --> 00:33:46,613
Speaker 1: Next weekend, this coming week, so this weekend, actually, I will be without Scott.

711
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:49,860
Speaker 1: Well, I'll have a different Scott at Zenkai Con on Saturday.

712
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:56,160
Speaker 1: I'm doing how to run an anime club, analyzing anime, utenna and practical game theory.

713
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:59,375
Speaker 0: He's not telling you is that this convention is in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

714
00:33:59,455 --> 00:34:00,460
Speaker 0: Don't fucking go there.

715
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:05,660
Speaker 1: Unless you live, only go to Zenkai Con if you live within a couple hours drive.

716
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:15,179
Speaker 0: If you live mad close, you can go on Saturday only, eat some Amish food, go to the con for a bit and then get the hell out before Sunday when they don't sell any Amish food because they're all Jesus-like.

717
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:16,241
Speaker 1: Yeah.

718
00:34:16,562 --> 00:34:24,498
Speaker 1: This is a town where we went to a bar and I wanted to order beer and I asked the waitress what beers they had and they only had three, but that's fine.

719
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:25,020
Speaker 1: Small town.

720
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:30,391
Speaker 1: And she said she didn't want to say the name of the third beer.

721
00:34:30,411 --> 00:34:33,938
Speaker 1: and I was like, "What can you give me a

722
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:34,039
Speaker 1: hint?".

723
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,487
Speaker 1: And she was like, "It's arrogant

724
00:34:36,568 --> 00:34:37,050
Speaker 1: something.".

725
00:34:37,371 --> 00:34:38,817
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "Oh yeah, I'll have an arrogant

726
00:34:38,857 --> 00:34:39,299
Speaker 1: bastard.".

727
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:47,699
Speaker 1: She visibly, physically flinched when I said the word bastard and got really uncomfortable around us for the entire evening.

728
00:34:47,862 --> 00:34:48,818
Speaker 0: Welcome to New York.

729
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:53,406
Speaker 1: Also, fucking nothing is open on Sunday except one bar.

730
00:34:53,485 --> 00:35:02,920
Speaker 1: Last year we just, after we did our last panel, well I did my last panel, those of us who were there just went to this bar and drank all day until we went home playing games.

731
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,943
Speaker 0: Yeah, so don't go there.

732
00:35:05,023 --> 00:35:10,520
Speaker 0: Instead, if you're in New York City, a good place to be, the best place to be, the Mocha Festival is happening.

733
00:35:11,303 --> 00:35:12,459
Speaker 0: Yes, the Mocha Fest.

734
00:35:13,301 --> 00:35:17,140
Speaker 0: It's declined in recent years, I can't lie, but it's still worth a day of your time.

735
00:35:17,422 --> 00:35:18,792
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's awesome stuff there.

736
00:35:18,973 --> 00:35:19,900
Speaker 1: and Emily.

737
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:22,979
Speaker 0: Emily bought a table so you can give her money if you want.

738
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,360
Speaker 1: Emily's going to be selling a whole bunch of stuff at her table.

739
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,399
Speaker 0: And she'll also be stuck in one place most of the time so she can't run away from you if you're that guy.

740
00:35:32,223 --> 00:35:34,219
Speaker 1: I see her shaking her head right now.

741
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:44,340
Speaker 1: But yeah, if you want to read her book or buy her book or see a bunch of art or stuff, she'll have a bunch of her friend artist things and she'll have her own stuff.

742
00:35:44,922 --> 00:35:50,820
Speaker 1: And this is the first Mocha Fest in a long time that I'm missing because Scott and I can't both bail on Zenkai Con.

743
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:51,411
Speaker 0: Why not?

744
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,180
Speaker 1: Professionals, we don't bail on a con.

745
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,667
Speaker 0: I mean, you should have bailed earlier.

746
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:56,511
Speaker 0: You could have bailed earlier.

747
00:35:56,551 --> 00:35:57,436
Speaker 0: You just waited too long.

748
00:35:57,496 --> 00:35:58,039
Speaker 0: Now you're stuck.

749
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,248
Speaker 1: Remember, one, Zenkai Con is pretty fun.

750
00:36:00,268 --> 00:36:02,740
Speaker 1: And two, that's an audience that we don't reach.

751
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:08,339
Speaker 0: Like, when I present a Zenkai Con- I don't need- Listen, I'm not going to reach someone who's going to wince when I say, "Fuck

752
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:08,460
Speaker 0: you.".

753
00:36:09,181 --> 00:36:11,700
Speaker 1: But a lot of the kids who go to the con are coming from Philly anyway.

754
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,478
Speaker 1: But I'm telling you, the kids at this con- Fuck them!

755
00:36:13,822 --> 00:36:15,150
Speaker 1: We'll get like a hundred people in the room.

756
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:17,840
Speaker 0: None of them- If you live in Philly, you can go fuck yourself.

757
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,270
Speaker 1: I remember last year, one of the panels, I filled the room.

758
00:36:21,752 --> 00:36:24,380
Speaker 1: No one in the room knew who I was or knew about Geek Nights or anything.

759
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,940
Speaker 1: Half of them didn't know what podcasts were and- Yeah, because they're from fucking Philly.

760
00:36:30,282 --> 00:36:31,349
Speaker 0: I don't need these people.

761
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:33,019
Speaker 0: I don't want to go anywhere near them.

762
00:36:33,281 --> 00:36:34,027
Speaker 1: I got to reach out.

763
00:36:34,047 --> 00:36:35,660
Speaker 1: I got to evangelize the geekery.

764
00:36:35,941 --> 00:36:35,984
Speaker 0: No.

765
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:37,099
Speaker 0: Why not?

766
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:40,960
Speaker 1: I thought that was the mission of Geek Nights, to expand horizons.

767
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:44,279
Speaker 0: Philadelphia people, they just need a little scorched earth policy down there.

768
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,360
Speaker 1: The book, I don't know why you hate Philly so much.

769
00:36:46,721 --> 00:36:49,399
Speaker 1: Philly, I would rather live in than most other cities in the U.S.

770
00:36:50,602 --> 00:36:54,580
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess compared to say like Jacksonville, Florida or something.

771
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:55,764
Speaker 1: I said cities.

772
00:36:55,805 --> 00:36:58,019
Speaker 1: There's a lot of cities that you don't want to live in.

773
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,719
Speaker 1: Philly at least is cosplaying a city.

774
00:37:03,681 --> 00:37:08,740
Speaker 1: Right after Zeikai Con, like a few weeks, PAX East, as we said- A real convention.

775
00:37:08,961 --> 00:37:12,080
Speaker 1: Well, we'll be there on Sunday doing Atari game design.

776
00:37:13,663 --> 00:37:15,739
Speaker 1: And yeah, then other conventions coming up after that.

777
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,978
Speaker 1: The next Book Club book's going to be Margaret Atwood, Orcs and Crake.

778
00:37:19,841 --> 00:37:23,978
Speaker 1: And I think I'm going to stop reading The Wheel of Time after I finish the 11th one.

779
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,440
Speaker 1: And then I'm going to start reading that.

780
00:37:25,621 --> 00:37:27,119
Speaker 0: Alright, I already got a copy, so I'm good.

781
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,580
Speaker 1: Tell me when you started.

782
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,159
Speaker 0: I also picked- I found a book- you stole my Book Club book.

783
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,786
Speaker 0: So I found another one.

784
00:37:33,866 --> 00:37:37,737
Speaker 0: that's, you know, maybe the most Geek Nights book I've ever seen.

785
00:37:37,777 --> 00:37:38,720
Speaker 0: that isn't Prince of Nothing.

786
00:37:39,221 --> 00:37:39,766
Speaker 0: How?

787
00:37:39,948 --> 00:37:41,100
Speaker 1: Okay, other than Prince of Nothing.

788
00:37:44,941 --> 00:37:45,465
Speaker 1: We'll see.

789
00:37:45,485 --> 00:37:47,340
Speaker 1: I'm vaguely trusting.

790
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,080
Speaker 1: So at PAX South, we needed a short game to play.

791
00:37:51,341 --> 00:37:52,900
Speaker 0: I played this game at Kineticon last year.

792
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,398
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I did not, because I was doing work.

793
00:37:55,461 --> 00:37:56,659
Speaker 1: So you want to introduce the game then?

794
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,522
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

795
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:59,409
Speaker 0: So it's a really tiny game.

796
00:37:59,469 --> 00:38:02,340
Speaker 0: It's published by Mayfair, who I guess used to publish Settlers.

797
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a Wolfgang Kringemührer game, so.

798
00:38:04,862 --> 00:38:07,760
Speaker 0: And it's a little tiny card game, and it's called Six Nymphs.

799
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:14,840
Speaker 0: And there's actually a whole lot going on in this tiny card game, and most of the things I have to say about it are positive.

800
00:38:15,721 --> 00:38:22,248
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a- there are a lot of little games like this, like No Thanks, like all those sort of like, "Hey, it's real easy to teach.

801
00:38:22,569 --> 00:38:23,334
Speaker 1: Just start playing it.

802
00:38:23,474 --> 00:38:23,896
Speaker 1: You'll have some

803
00:38:23,917 --> 00:38:24,158
Speaker 1: fun.".

804
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,380
Speaker 1: But usually those games do not hold people's attention.

805
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:34,040
Speaker 1: Like, if I bust out No Thanks, people really like it once, but no one wants to play it again right then and there.

806
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,978
Speaker 0: Yeah, Six Nymphs you can play quite a few times.

807
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:46,360
Speaker 1: I mean, I've taught this to people who were drinking, and had been drinking, and were yelling and socializing, and not paying attention too much, and then they are really into the game.

808
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,409
Speaker 0: Well, the fun part of the game, right, so here's the-.

809
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:54,880
Speaker 0: so you know Nym, Nym is the game that Rym likes, where you have sticks, and on your turn you pick up sticks, and whoever picks up the last stick loses.

810
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,860
Speaker 0: So it's got that unstable, stable state, combinatorial game theory going on, right?

811
00:38:59,561 --> 00:39:02,800
Speaker 0: Six Nymt is basically the same game, that's why it's called Nymt, right?

812
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,083
Speaker 0: It's just more advanced.

813
00:39:04,163 --> 00:39:07,635
Speaker 0: There's a deck of cards numbered from 1 to 104, and there's four rows.

814
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:13,620
Speaker 0: And on your turn, and everyone simultaneously turns- Two to ten players.

815
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,345
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's great, so many players.

816
00:39:15,707 --> 00:39:23,160
Speaker 0: You take a card from your hand of random cards, everyone has the same size hand, and put it face down, and then everyone simultaneously reveals.

817
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:39,840
Speaker 0: Starting with the lowest card, the cards are added to the appropriate row, the appropriate row being the row in which there is a- the rightmost card is lower than the card the person has played, and then amongst those rows, which of the cards is the highest.

818
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,700
Speaker 0: So if I play a 30, and one of the rows is a 29 in its rightmost spot, my 30 is going there, right?

819
00:39:46,101 --> 00:39:55,588
Speaker 0: If I play a 74, and there's a row with a 94, a 63, and a 52, it's going in the row with the 63, because that's the highest number.

820
00:39:55,628 --> 00:39:57,600
Speaker 0: that's lower than my 70, whatever I just said.

821
00:39:59,246 --> 00:40:02,380
Speaker 0: So you just keep- everyone simultaneously reveals, and plays cards out there.

822
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,919
Speaker 0: Pretty simple, that's the whole rules of how to play the game, but it's Six Nymt.

823
00:40:07,861 --> 00:40:15,483
Speaker 0: If you play the sixth card in a row, meaning there are already five cards in a row, and your card gets forced into that row, you take

824
00:40:15,543 --> 00:40:16,287
Speaker 1: all those cards,

825
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:22,660
Speaker 0: you take all the five cards that are already there, and your sixth card replaces that row, and is now starting a new row.

826
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:31,340
Speaker 0: When you take those cards, all the cards have little pictures of bulls on them, some cards have more bullshit than others, whoever has the least bullshit wins.

827
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,700
Speaker 0: So you don't want to play the sixth card in a row.

828
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:46,980
Speaker 0: Also, the only other rule, if you play a card, and the number on that card is lower than the rightmost cards of every row of all four rows, you pick a row to take, it could be a tiny row with only one card in it, which would be awesome.

829
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,440
Speaker 1: There might not be a tiny row.

830
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:56,240
Speaker 0: There might not be a tiny row, and then your card makes a new row that is lower than all the other rows, and then everyone else's card comes out according to the rules.

831
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:05,860
Speaker 1: And then it's basically hearts rules, you keep playing until someone hits 66, because six is a number in this game, and then whoever has the lowest score wins, if there's a tie, joint victory, it's a whole game.

832
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,119
Speaker 0: Right, so here's what makes the game really interesting, right?

833
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,199
Speaker 1: It's got some gobs going on, other than that, not all the cards are out.

834
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:21,420
Speaker 1: So, nothing changes, you've got ten cards, you've got to play all ten, everyone's got to play ten cards.

835
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,380
Speaker 0: It's just which order you're going to play them in, right?

836
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:26,180
Speaker 0: So you're looking at the board state, and there's different moves you can try.

837
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:38,040
Speaker 0: For example, if there's not a lot of cards in the rows, maybe you could just try to get rid of your low cards, and take some low points, and then hope later in the round you'll be safe, and other people end up taking the big cards.

838
00:41:38,441 --> 00:41:49,760
Speaker 1: But, if you have only high cards, the board could get a range, or the table could get a range in such a way, that all the high cards you have are very likely to take some old terrible row that's full of bulls.

839
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,260
Speaker 0: Right, also, let's say you've got the 104 in your hand, the highest card in the game.

840
00:41:53,741 --> 00:41:57,080
Speaker 0: You could try to play it right away, and that would basically go in the final row.

841
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:05,620
Speaker 0: Like, say the final row has a 54 in it, you could put the 104 right next to it, and now anything less than 104 is going in row three.

842
00:42:06,122 --> 00:42:10,000
Speaker 0: And nothing new is going in row four at all, because nothing's higher than 104.

843
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:25,160
Speaker 0: And now, someone puts a 90-something in row three, and now every new card is going in rows one and two, and suddenly, the game gets really hairy until somebody plays a super low card, and intentionally takes row three and four, and you can create this lockdown effect, right?

844
00:42:25,521 --> 00:42:27,246
Speaker 0: So you have all these different ways you can play.

845
00:42:27,266 --> 00:42:46,020
Speaker 0: You could intentionally try to take those rows to unlock the game, and maybe you'll get less points now in order to get even, you know, to lower the total points you would've taken if you didn't open the game up, or maybe you can just keep holding out, hoping that someone else bites the bullet, and ends up taking the nymph, and then you can clear your hand and get zero points, and woo!

846
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,447
Speaker 1: And, yeah, like, think about that.

847
00:42:48,467 --> 00:42:53,404
Speaker 1: you've played that strategy of, I play the high number to lock something down, so I play the 104.

848
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:58,560
Speaker 1: What if all the other players play, like, 55, 58, 60, and then I just take the row and I'm completely screwed?

849
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:14,307
Speaker 0: Sometimes there'd be only a little bit of space between rows, and, like, you have the card that fits there, and, like, and, like, there'll be a 94 in a row, and the next row has, like, 100 in it, so the only cards that can go in that third row would be, like, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, so only, like, five or six cards, right?

850
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:18,985
Speaker 0: And there's four cards in the row.

851
00:43:19,406 --> 00:43:22,494
Speaker 0: Someone else is like, "Ahaha, I'll play my 97,".

852
00:43:22,494 --> 00:43:28,213
Speaker 0: and then it'll go right there in that row, and there's no way I'm taking that row, 'cause no one's gonna play any card, right?

853
00:43:28,294 --> 00:43:35,180
Speaker 0: And someone else is gonna have to take that row, and somebody sneaks in with, like, one of the two cards that could've fucked you, and now you take that row.

854
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,217
Speaker 0: It's like,

855
00:43:36,237 --> 00:43:36,380
Speaker 0: "Ahhh!".

856
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:43,320
Speaker 1: What is fascinating is how drastically different the game is with every number of players.

857
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:44,040
Speaker 0: Oh, huge difference.

858
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,500
Speaker 1: The three-player game, the four-player game.

859
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:45,980
Speaker 0: Tremendous differences.

860
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,218
Speaker 1: Might as well be different games.

861
00:43:47,444 --> 00:43:47,717
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

862
00:43:49,042 --> 00:43:57,740
Speaker 0: When you play, once you get to six players, that makes the biggest gap, because suddenly, you can just, boom, oh, actually, with five players, 'cause every row already has a card in it, right?

863
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:06,780
Speaker 0: As soon as you get to five players, it changes drastically, 'cause if everyone plays a card for the same row, you can just play something that looked totally safe and end up taking a whole bunch of cards right away.

864
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:30,000
Speaker 1: Yep, like, in three- and four-player, there'll be rows where everyone is guaranteed to be able to play something safe, and as a result, the game will often get locked up pretty quick, and then it'll come down to, did the person who locked it up have cards to make the game cycle where they will, every round, take no points, and someone else will take a bunch of points, which we saw happen reliably.

865
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:32,520
Speaker 1: There was always one person who just got wrecked in that situation.

866
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,300
Speaker 0: I mean, I can't say this game has a lot of strategy, but it also has a lot of luck, right?

867
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,020
Speaker 0: At the beginning of the game, you deal with, what, ten cards to every player?

868
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,392
Speaker 1: Yep, and there's 104 cards in the deck.

869
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:44,480
Speaker 0: So even if you play with the max of ten players, there's four missing cards, right?

870
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,727
Speaker 0: But there is significant luck.

871
00:44:45,747 --> 00:44:47,760
Speaker 0: If you could just get, like, all low cards, it could happen.

872
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:48,234
Speaker 0: But!

873
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,324
Speaker 0: There's no reason it couldn't happen.

874
00:44:49,344 --> 00:44:53,560
Speaker 0: You can get a really bad mix of cards such that you're just screwed.

875
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,180
Speaker 1: But playing multiple games and all that actually helps a lot.

876
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,480
Speaker 1: The fact that you keep playing games of it.

877
00:44:59,540 --> 00:44:59,862
Speaker 0: Right, yes.

878
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:02,840
Speaker 0: Because it's not one round doesn't determine the whole thing, right?

879
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:13,900
Speaker 0: You play until someone gets 66, so even if you get screwed one round, you play enough rounds that theoretically, if you're good at the game, you're gonna win because it evens out over the course, right?

880
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:15,619
Speaker 1: Yep, yep.

881
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:25,600
Speaker 0: So what makes the game super fun, even if you don't get to the deep strategies and everything, is just that nymph mechanic is like an exciting hot potato kind of deal.

882
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:32,009
Speaker 0: The drama of there's this row building up with a bunch of bulls in it, and who's gonna, is someone gonna take it?

883
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:35,633
Speaker 0: Is somebody forced to take it because they have a bad card and they're just holding out waiting to play it?

884
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,636
Speaker 1: It's a game where everyone's cards go out safely, and then everyone's like, "Oh no!

885
00:45:40,018 --> 00:45:40,138
Speaker 1: Oh

886
00:45:40,179 --> 00:45:40,360
Speaker 1: no!".

887
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:42,978
Speaker 1: because there's a bunch of full rows and it's super dangerous.

888
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:46,400
Speaker 0: It's like when someone takes the big row, it's like the hot potato exploded on them.

889
00:45:46,662 --> 00:45:46,744
Speaker 1: Like,

890
00:45:46,764 --> 00:45:46,805
Speaker 1: "Oh!".

891
00:45:47,861 --> 00:45:50,149
Speaker 1: It ends up being a really high drama game.

892
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:52,840
Speaker 1: Like, people get really intense about it.

893
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:58,280
Speaker 0: Right, and what really increases the drama even more is that every card doesn't have the same number of bulls on it, right?

894
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:01,039
Speaker 0: Some cards have just way more bulls on them.

895
00:46:01,461 --> 00:46:08,180
Speaker 0: So it's like, you could have a row and even only with two cards in it, could have more bulls than a row with like five cards that only have one bull each.

896
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:12,775
Speaker 0: And that could be like, so someone could end up taking that, and it really sucks.

897
00:46:13,257 --> 00:46:13,980
Speaker 0: Really sucks.

898
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,980
Speaker 1: So, I guess what I'm really amazed by even more than that is the mechanical.

899
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:32,259
Speaker 1: It's a sound game, it's quick to play, but people really like it, even though when you first show it to them, they see these hundred and four, you tell someone, "Alright, this game has cards numbered between one and a hundred and

900
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:32,500
Speaker 1: four.".

901
00:46:33,703 --> 00:46:40,280
Speaker 0: And the only thing that's fun appearance-wise and aesthetically is the art is a little bit fun, right?

902
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,911
Speaker 0: But it's just outlines of bullheads.

903
00:46:43,212 --> 00:46:44,459
Speaker 0: There's not much going on there.

904
00:46:45,841 --> 00:46:49,594
Speaker 0: Other games have cute graphics or animals or characters.

905
00:46:49,634 --> 00:46:51,420
Speaker 0: It's just bullheads and numbers.

906
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,178
Speaker 1: You kind of get to rope people in and be like, "Hey, I'll teach you the

907
00:46:54,198 --> 00:46:54,380
Speaker 1: game.".

908
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,159
Speaker 1: And you can teach it so fast that they're like,

909
00:46:56,179 --> 00:46:56,260
Speaker 1: "Oh.".

910
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,244
Speaker 0: I just taught it to you.

911
00:46:57,546 --> 00:47:02,246
Speaker 0: Usually when we teach board games, we'll give sort of an explanation on the show, but not go into every detail.

912
00:47:02,608 --> 00:47:05,100
Speaker 0: I literally told you a hundred percent of the rules in this game.

913
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:12,700
Speaker 1: But what makes the game great, the reason you can play it with people, even if they're distracted, even if they're drunk.

914
00:47:13,702 --> 00:47:15,110
Speaker 0: All you do is play a card.

915
00:47:15,191 --> 00:47:16,760
Speaker 0: There's no other weird decisions to make.

916
00:47:17,261 --> 00:47:20,980
Speaker 0: And then everything after the playing of the card is not decisions, but just execution.

917
00:47:21,541 --> 00:47:28,960
Speaker 0: If one person can do the execution, then it's drunk enough, at least sober enough to do the execution.

918
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:29,564
Speaker 1: So think about that.

919
00:47:29,644 --> 00:47:36,460
Speaker 1: All you have to do is pick a card from your hand, thinking, and once everyone's ready, it's simultaneous reveal, and then there's no more thinking.

920
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,233
Speaker 1: It's just play out what happens.

921
00:47:38,334 --> 00:47:39,040
Speaker 1: Play out the drama.

922
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,459
Speaker 0: And you do it ten times game over.

923
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:41,001
Speaker 1: Yup.

924
00:47:41,583 --> 00:47:45,120
Speaker 1: Now with ten players, you've dealt out a hundred cards.

925
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,000
Speaker 0: The four left are the ones that start the rows.

926
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:50,308
Speaker 1: So you pretty much know that every card's out there.

927
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:54,820
Speaker 1: So then it becomes multiplayer GOPS, effectively.

928
00:47:55,001 --> 00:47:59,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, because you'll see, like, well, there's a 94 and a 97.

929
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:05,040
Speaker 0: I could try for the 96, but I know the 95 exists and is in someone's hand because it hasn't been played yet.

930
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:09,920
Speaker 0: But counting cards becomes a big deal because once a row is taken, you've got to remember what was in there.

931
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:16,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at least unlike GOPS, one person might have the 96 and the 97 and the 98.

932
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:16,565
Speaker 1: Like, you don't know.

933
00:48:16,585 --> 00:48:18,000
Speaker 1: It's not like everyone has the same hand.

934
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:19,379
Speaker 0: That's entirely possible, yes.

935
00:48:19,621 --> 00:48:24,960
Speaker 1: Because the thing about GOPS to make it a hundred percent pure is that everyone has the exact same hand as well.

936
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:29,750
Speaker 1: But if you need to get paid, this replaces No.

937
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:32,298
Speaker 1: Thanks for Me as the "Hey guys, wanna play a quick

938
00:48:32,318 --> 00:48:32,539
Speaker 1: game?"

939
00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:32,920
Speaker 1: at a con.

940
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:33,544
Speaker 1: Like, let's just go.

941
00:48:33,565 --> 00:48:33,908
Speaker 1: Play a game.

942
00:48:34,312 --> 00:48:35,059
Speaker 1: Spot it or this.

943
00:48:36,462 --> 00:48:37,819
Speaker 1: They're, like, perfect for this purpose.

944
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,625
Speaker 0: Also, you can get this game way cheap.

945
00:48:39,726 --> 00:48:43,720
Speaker 0: I remember at PAX, they had it at the Mayfair booth, like, stacks of it, and it was, like, mad discounted.

946
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,480
Speaker 1: I think I paid, like, four bucks for my copy.

947
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:46,786
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're trying to get rid of these.

948
00:48:46,846 --> 00:48:48,956
Speaker 0: You can probably get two of these and give them as a gift.

949
00:48:49,377 --> 00:48:49,880
Speaker 0: Great gift.

950
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:53,380
Speaker 0: Great gift for someone who plays some games or even the non-gamer type.

951
00:48:54,961 --> 00:48:55,149
Speaker 0: So cheap.

952
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,700
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

953
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:08,820

960
00:49:48,701 --> 00:49:51,640
Speaker 1: And the Patreon Patrons for this episode of Geek Nights.

961
00:49:51,781 --> 00:50:34,520
Speaker 1: In order of the amount of money they give us, if they give us at least $5 are... Rebecca Dunn, Nicholas Brandow, Alan Joyce, Heidi McNichol, Amanda Duchette, James David White, Chris Chien, thanks for consistently pronouncing it correctly, Kuntz, Jess, MyStady.com, Mechanical Mind, William Eisenroz, Jeremy Minor, HowMuchMudGoodMudKipKipMudKipKipMud, Tyler Eller, Scott John Harrison, Sean Yeager, Clinton Walton, Ren from New Zealand, Robert Lee, Ryan Perrin, Drew Openlander, Rara Lavelle, Brian Cidroni, Rochelle Montanona, Finn Eric Silverheart, CantmeltSteelBeams, Kinetic Man, Aaron Cerise, Chris Midkiff, Chris Knox, Flame Darkfire, Sam Cordery, Daniel Redman, Chris Hadad, Sean Klein, Chris Reimer, and Thomas Hahn.

962
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:42,900
Speaker 1: So in the two player game of Civ, because I know Scott won't listen to this that we're playing right now, the one on the bus, he feels like he's doing okay.

963
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:49,250
Speaker 1: He does not understand the extent of the army that I have hanging out on this island.

964
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:54,440
Speaker 1: that I won't let him see because he only has one trireme and I just attack him anytime he comes anywhere near it.

965
00:50:55,100 --> 00:51:02,720
Speaker 1: I'm just massing troops over there and when we start the game on the way to PAX, I just have to pick the moment when I'm going to go over the sea and just destroy him.

966
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:06,328
Speaker 1: So in the game we're playing now, I can see a hut.

967
00:51:06,369 --> 00:51:07,051
Speaker 1: I was lying.

968
00:51:07,151 --> 00:51:08,294
Speaker 1: I can definitely see a hut.

969
00:51:08,535 --> 00:51:10,100
Speaker 1: I want him to feel like he's getting ahead.

970
00:51:10,481 --> 00:51:19,180
Speaker 1: I want him to feel like he's really got things going on and I'm going to try to hide the army that I'm going to build like in a corner of the continent where he's not going to look like up north.

971
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:27,780
Speaker 1: And I'm pretty confident that I can wait for a hilariously opportune moment and suddenly the forces come over the hill.

972
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:29,702
Speaker 1: Stay tuned for all our stuff.

973
00:51:29,762 --> 00:51:33,249
Speaker 1: We did record Judge Anime by its cover at Anime Boston.

974
00:51:33,509 --> 00:51:39,280
Speaker 1: We also did record How to Run an Anime Club and Role Playing Anime.

975
00:51:39,681 --> 00:51:47,120
Speaker 1: So I might make those available to at least you patrons, even if they're not necessarily good enough quality to put on the general geek nights, public whatever.

976
00:51:48,181 --> 00:51:51,739
Speaker 1: And now I leave you with something kind of weird and dumb.

977
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:58,959
Speaker 0: Woman's log number 224 wrapped land isn't wrapping anymore.

978
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:01,245
Speaker 0: Cooper took their king and the money too.

979
00:52:01,385 --> 00:52:03,350
Speaker 1: We're here to figure out what to do.

980
00:52:06,651 --> 00:52:08,409
Speaker 1: I'll bet Cooper's going to get that gold.

981
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,998
Speaker 0: But how's he making them do what they're told?

982
00:52:23,041 --> 00:52:24,065
Speaker 1: I'm wrapping, Cooper.

983
00:52:24,165 --> 00:52:25,029
Speaker 1: Do what I say.

984
00:52:25,049 --> 00:52:27,338
Speaker 1: Bring me your gold coins right away.

985
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:37,100
Speaker 1: Yo, King James, you're a dweeb.

986
00:52:37,742 --> 00:52:38,726
Speaker 1: I run wrapped land.

987
00:52:38,806 --> 00:52:39,750
Speaker 1: I'm never going to leave.

988
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:42,238
Speaker 0: Who be a chump, you ugly fang face?

989
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,809
Speaker 0: My plaid boy is going to bring me from this place.

990
00:52:48,321 --> 00:52:50,179
Speaker 0: Plaid boy, smair boy, hey, hey, hey.
