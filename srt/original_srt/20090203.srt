Speaker 1: We're doing a Tuesday show.

10
00:00:34,438 --> 00:00:44,240
Speaker 1: there was no Monday show last night because we We accidentally tried to do a Tuesday Thursday week after already having Donna Tuesday Thursday week.

11
00:00:44,981 --> 00:00:46,706
Speaker 0: Yeah, whose fault is that entirely?

12
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:48,452
Speaker 0: Scott's what he's talking about.

13
00:00:48,914 --> 00:00:50,178
Speaker 1: I was like on Sunday.

14
00:00:50,198 --> 00:00:51,805
Speaker 1: I was like hey Scott What are we doing the show on?

15
00:00:51,845 --> 00:00:52,468
Speaker 1: He's like, I don't know.

16
00:00:52,529 --> 00:00:54,760
Speaker 1: and I was like, well, it's Tuesday, right?

17
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,238
Speaker 0: And he's like, yeah, I was like, I don't know.

18
00:00:58,863 --> 00:01:00,479
Speaker 0: And you said yeah, it's Tuesday, right?

19
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:02,344
Speaker 0: There it's your fault.

20
00:01:02,505 --> 00:01:06,140
Speaker 0: Um, but yeah, I don't know if there's gonna be another show this week.

21
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,972
Speaker 0: Are we gonna see that movie on Thursday?

22
00:01:08,072 --> 00:01:10,898
Speaker 1: Yeah, so maybe we'll do a Wednesday show Like we should have.

23
00:01:11,642 --> 00:01:14,812
Speaker 1: So we'll only be out one Monday as opposed to just totally cocking it up.

24
00:01:14,952 --> 00:01:19,560
Speaker 0: and the comic-con is Friday Saturday Sunday But I had to go to grandma's birthday party on Saturday.

25
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,296
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm probably gonna go Saturday Sunday and Scott's fucking like Friday.

26
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:24,180
Speaker 1: We got to figure all that out.

27
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,892
Speaker 0: Yeah, what to do something, but oh, yeah, New York Comic Con is this weekend.

28
00:01:28,314 --> 00:01:28,554
Speaker 1: Yep.

29
00:01:28,635 --> 00:01:30,180
Speaker 1: So we're not doing should go.

30
00:01:30,501 --> 00:01:32,468
Speaker 1: We are not doing any shows.

31
00:01:32,548 --> 00:01:33,150
Speaker 1: They're nothing.

32
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:33,572
Speaker 1: live.

33
00:01:33,592 --> 00:01:34,575
Speaker 1: We're not doing anything.

34
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:37,204
Speaker 1: the next New York Comic Con We probably will this one.

35
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,086
Speaker 1: now, we're just press.

36
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:42,800
Speaker 1: So if you want to find us look for Luke Crane at the mouse guard table.

37
00:01:43,502 --> 00:01:47,436
Speaker 0: Look for two guys with press badges walking around looking around.

38
00:01:47,837 --> 00:01:48,680
Speaker 1: We kind of stand out.

39
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:56,439
Speaker 1: we'll probably have Emily with us as a photographer and such and we might have Alex and Jess and other front row crew people hanging out at least one of the days.

40
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:58,385
Speaker 1: so We're not that hard to find.

41
00:01:58,846 --> 00:02:04,020
Speaker 1: but I it is, you know, I had found myself over the weekend at a circuit city.

42
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:12,759
Speaker 1: you know, they're going out of business and Unlike previous goings out of business of stores, like when media play went out of business You couldn't get deals on anything.

43
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:17,220
Speaker 0: Well, cuz I mean basically what happens is they put tiny discounts on first of all.

44
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,959
Speaker 0: Right, if you go to a store that's not going out of business.

45
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,280
Speaker 0: Everything in the store is slightly discounted right just about nothing is a manufacturer retail price.

46
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,559
Speaker 0: That's red ludicrous Apple products, right?

47
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:40,100
Speaker 0: So if you go to the when they liquidate a school a store They basically return everything to manufacturers suggested retail price and then put like a 10 or 20 percent discount on everything.

48
00:02:40,322 --> 00:02:42,860
Speaker 1: But anyway, the economy used to be different.

49
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:48,920
Speaker 1: So like when media play went out like upstream suppliers would take stuff back and like other people would buy it in ball.

50
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:54,520
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean you couldn't buy books when media play went out of business because someone else just came in and bought all the books.

51
00:02:55,182 --> 00:02:59,380
Speaker 0: So you couldn't you know go in and individually get books at like half off or worse.

52
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:16,594
Speaker 1: It was kind of an aside that it made me realize what media is worth to me because there was stuff left Like there were anime DVDs for like four bucks and there were video like computer games like $50 computer games for five bucks And I stood there holding them and then decided they weren't worth what I

53
00:03:16,634 --> 00:03:23,383
Speaker 0: bought this Atari DS game Basically had like breakout and a few other Atari games like directly translate It was not

54
00:03:23,443 --> 00:03:24,849
Speaker 1: worth the like 90 cents.

55
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:27,700
Speaker 0: You paid almost nothing for it and I regret buying it.

56
00:03:28,347 --> 00:03:29,238
Speaker 0: That's how bad it was.

57
00:03:29,701 --> 00:03:41,420
Speaker 1: But now with the economy the way it is you got a circuit city and they've got like everything actually Discounted and they've got everything still there because people aren't buying it so quickly and people lined up.

58
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,047
Speaker 0: But people you know, it's not they're not buying enough The things they bought right away.

59
00:03:46,087 --> 00:03:46,609
Speaker 1: what's gone?

60
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,300
Speaker 1: like those netbooks they had 10 20% off are all gone.

61
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:54,097
Speaker 1: No, yeah, definitely, but not gone the DS games and they're all like 20% off.

62
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:59,478
Speaker 1: So I went in and I realized that I don't want any DS games that are already out.

63
00:03:59,518 --> 00:04:01,082
Speaker 1: all the DS games I want aren't out yet.

64
00:04:01,203 --> 00:04:01,363
Speaker 0: Yeah.

65
00:04:01,704 --> 00:04:10,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, I pre-ordered the Fire Emblem game and I also pre-ordered this other game like Henry Hats worth puzzling adventure or something like that.

66
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:12,336
Speaker 0: It's a puzzle II platform game.

67
00:04:12,376 --> 00:04:13,180
Speaker 0: I'll figure what the hell.

68
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,429
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're talking it up.

69
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,558
Speaker 1: We need something like that.

70
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:19,807
Speaker 0: because Yeah, well there have been.

71
00:04:19,867 --> 00:04:22,440
Speaker 0: no I think there have been at least two sequels just not in the u.s.

72
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,214
Speaker 1: You're mistaking this for Japan where they get good game.

73
00:04:25,295 --> 00:04:40,340
Speaker 1: There's found three Buzz us three, I wouldn't pay five These games but I would probably pay if I had no other option Almost a hundred dollars for a DS cart that just had mother one two and three on it in English.

74
00:04:40,701 --> 00:04:43,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, like that would be with a quality translation.

75
00:04:43,311 --> 00:04:48,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you can get the ROM but really honestly, really honestly.

76
00:04:49,902 --> 00:04:56,420
Speaker 1: But the only game they had that was worthwhile that I didn't already own Was Final Fantasy Tactics Advance 2 and I wouldn't have bought it.

77
00:04:56,741 --> 00:04:59,228
Speaker 1: it was like 20 bucks and I still wouldn't have bought it.

78
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:07,379
Speaker 1: but for the fact that a nonth had it and The he said it was good enough for someone like me to play and I trust him.

79
00:05:11,604 --> 00:05:18,859
Speaker 1: I played the other one until I realized that No amount of strategy at any impact on maybe you know, it's not true for the new one.

80
00:05:19,863 --> 00:05:21,369
Speaker 1: Oh as soon as I discover that's true.

81
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:22,494
Speaker 1: I'll probably stop playing it.

82
00:05:22,534 --> 00:05:26,118
Speaker 1: but to its credit Dragon girls pretty cute.

83
00:05:28,482 --> 00:05:32,840
Speaker 1: They also updated the designs of the bunny girls and you can see the appeal of this.

84
00:05:34,341 --> 00:05:35,480
Speaker 0: That's that's just fantastic.

85
00:05:35,681 --> 00:05:47,465
Speaker 1: Actually, one of the things that I liked about the the previous tactics was the whole, you know Fighting with the other clans thing was like this a side game But it didn't really matter except for getting you a bunch of McGuffins and goodies and you know my bath.

86
00:05:47,485 --> 00:05:56,040
Speaker 1: my dad does five more damage now, but They really upped the ante on the clan battling like you get territory and control it and we'll see.

87
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:02,400
Speaker 1: I'll talk about the game in more depth Once I play it for more than I don't know five minutes because I still haven't beaten Dracula yet in the most recent.

88
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,048
Speaker 1: Oh my god, there's a bad guy.

89
00:06:04,088 --> 00:06:04,550
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

90
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,756
Speaker 1: It's actually Dracula game.

91
00:06:05,776 --> 00:06:14,910
Speaker 0: Yeah So it's actually it's sort of opportune that we did the show today and messed up and didn't do one yesterday like we were supposed to.

92
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,487
Speaker 0: Because I don't know it's all over the news.

93
00:06:18,548 --> 00:06:27,986
Speaker 0: I don't know how anyone could possibly miss it, but 50 years ago today was the day that the music died and No one in the forum said anything.

94
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:42,560
Speaker 0: so I'm assuming that the punk kids have no clue why this is a big deal and I think it is very important that I teach them a lesson Exactly how large the magnitude of this tragedy was and why it is all over the news.

95
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,530
Speaker 1: What does not deserve like an entire show unto itself?

96
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:48,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I don't have an entire show unto itself to do this.

97
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,237
Speaker 1: We could do a special.

98
00:06:50,422 --> 00:06:51,326
Speaker 0: You have a non Tuesday.

99
00:06:51,407 --> 00:07:01,880
Speaker 0: All right, regardless punk kids take heed Right, so Imagine if right imagine this John Lennon Furtie Mercury and Jimmy Page.

100
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:07,940
Speaker 0: Imagine if all of them in like the middle like the middle of the 60s right when they were just getting started or whatever.

101
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:11,274
Speaker 0: All died like, you know, I don't know.

102
00:07:11,294 --> 00:07:14,680
Speaker 0: they were out of you know They were in a plane in a crash and they all died.

103
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:18,073
Speaker 0: Imagine what the world would be like right now how different it would be.

104
00:07:18,394 --> 00:07:19,880
Speaker 1: imagine if art its video game night.

105
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:21,395
Speaker 1: imagine if she get her.

106
00:07:21,435 --> 00:07:30,180
Speaker 1: Miyamoto Had just Never been born or he died halfway through like the early days of Nintendo times three.

107
00:07:31,103 --> 00:07:31,585
Speaker 0: So it was.

108
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:35,398
Speaker 0: it wasn't just Miyamoto is also Iwata and Yokoi all three of them.

109
00:07:35,418 --> 00:07:35,900
Speaker 1: Not Gunpei.

110
00:07:37,546 --> 00:07:38,397
Speaker 0: Yeah, Gunpei Yokoi.

111
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:42,269
Speaker 1: What did he ever do that was good everything?

112
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:44,678
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway except for except for getting off.

113
00:07:44,718 --> 00:07:47,834
Speaker 0: imagine Imagine how different everything would be right.

114
00:07:48,096 --> 00:07:53,280
Speaker 0: so you think you know You try to think of the world with like three super important people missing from it.

115
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,727
Speaker 0: Well, you know what you live in that world.

116
00:07:55,747 --> 00:07:59,860
Speaker 0: three super important people are missing from the world that we live in.

117
00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:11,480
Speaker 0: The world is fucked up because 50 years ago the Buddy Holly Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper were in a plane and it crashed and they all died.

118
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:15,755
Speaker 1: There's a lot of speculation as to why it crashed and what.

119
00:08:15,815 --> 00:08:17,120
Speaker 0: well, no, there's no spec.

120
00:08:17,243 --> 00:08:18,040
Speaker 0: I'll tell you the story.

121
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:31,100
Speaker 1: There is quote-unquote speculation because I remember very distinctly as a kid I was watching the History Channel and they had a documentary that was called something like what really happened when the music died.

122
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,193
Speaker 0: I'll tell you what really happened and pretty much it was like they were free basic.

123
00:08:35,695 --> 00:08:36,698
Speaker 1: No, what the fuck?

124
00:08:36,859 --> 00:08:37,240
Speaker 1: This is what?

125
00:08:38,303 --> 00:08:47,436
Speaker 1: All I'm saying is that no this was a documentary That Pretended it was legitimate that I saw as a kid and I was somewhat incredulous even then.

126
00:08:47,456 --> 00:08:48,700
Speaker 0: All right, here's the stall.

127
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:49,849
Speaker 0: Summarize the story.

128
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:51,179
Speaker 0: Of course people have studied this.

129
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:57,660
Speaker 0: You know event intensely and there are incredible incredible amounts of detail like but minute by minute what happened?

130
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,387
Speaker 0: But I will summarize for you ready.

131
00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:02,280
Speaker 0: So all these musicians were on tour, right?

132
00:09:02,741 --> 00:09:12,020
Speaker 0: but this was like, you know, this is they were touring around the Midwest and You know back in those days it was just a normal kind of you know ballroom music tour, right?

133
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,040
Speaker 0: It didn't have a big high profile or anything.

134
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:22,431
Speaker 0: But you know really nowadays you look at a concert tour and it's got like a headline band and like a middle Bad and like, you know some low-hanging fruits.

135
00:09:22,993 --> 00:09:29,757
Speaker 0: This was like, you know Historically when you look back at it was like all number one straight across the board.

136
00:09:29,797 --> 00:09:30,700
Speaker 0: this tour, right?

137
00:09:31,141 --> 00:09:42,980
Speaker 0: The thing is the tour organizer was stupid and he basically the tour dates were like one night They'd be in Chicago and one night they'd be in Detroit and then one night they'd be back in like, Indiana.

138
00:09:43,362 --> 00:09:48,000
Speaker 0: So they're basically going back and forth and back and forth instead of you know in a nice row.

139
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:50,730
Speaker 0: So it was lots and lots of extra travel.

140
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:54,264
Speaker 0: So everyone was real tired and real grumpy Right.

141
00:09:54,847 --> 00:10:03,960
Speaker 0: in addition they were on a tour bus as you know Was the style of the times and still is and the tour bus had no heat and it was like the worst tour bus imaginable.

142
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,297
Speaker 0: It was like the biggest piece of shit.

143
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:12,340
Speaker 0: So one night right there was no concert and the concert promoter guy like got them a show, right?

144
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:19,484
Speaker 0: he's like, oh I got a show to fill in the empty night and they had to go all the way back somewhere else and From where they were.

145
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,237
Speaker 0: so some of the guys are just like, you know what?

146
00:10:22,298 --> 00:10:25,360
Speaker 0: Fuck this Let's see if we can charter a fucking plane.

147
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:26,423
Speaker 0: Let's just do it.

148
00:10:26,885 --> 00:10:30,697
Speaker 0: and you know, some people were like no I can't pay the money right like.

149
00:10:30,818 --> 00:10:32,707
Speaker 0: one guy said You know, it's gonna be.

150
00:10:32,747 --> 00:10:33,874
Speaker 0: they found out it was gonna be $36, you know.

151
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,568
Speaker 0: And I think three people could go see.

152
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:42,445
Speaker 0: one guy like remembered how when he was a kid his parents like couldn't get $36 to the rent.

153
00:10:42,465 --> 00:10:46,200
Speaker 0: so he was like there's no way I'm paying a whole rent on a plane ride.

154
00:10:46,943 --> 00:10:53,318
Speaker 0: But you know and in the end You know buddy Holly the big bopper and Richie Valens were the three who were on the plane.

155
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:59,147
Speaker 0: one of them I think was on the plane because they want a coin toss or something and They plane crashed.

156
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,019
Speaker 0: the reason the plane crash is very simple.

157
00:11:01,401 --> 00:11:05,254
Speaker 0: Remember the bus had no heat and they were grumpy about it because it was winter.

158
00:11:05,355 --> 00:11:05,936
Speaker 0: It was cold.

159
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:06,920
Speaker 0: It was snowing.

160
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,064
Speaker 0: There was a snowstorm.

161
00:11:08,445 --> 00:11:15,030
Speaker 0: the pilot, you know, this is the kind of guy that you charter like, you know You just will go out to the airport and charted this dude.

162
00:11:15,292 --> 00:11:17,320
Speaker 0: He was not the greatest pilot in the universe.

163
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,480
Speaker 0: He actually couldn't fly on instruments only and it was night and it was a snowstorm and he was a bad pilot.

164
00:11:25,222 --> 00:11:28,140
Speaker 1: Channel said they were all free-basing cocaine.

165
00:11:28,782 --> 00:11:32,414
Speaker 0: They might have been as they were musicians in the late 50s.

166
00:11:32,895 --> 00:11:34,260
Speaker 0: cocaine may have been involved.

167
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:39,470
Speaker 0: However, the reason for the plane crash, it was probably not the cocaine if any.

168
00:11:41,322 --> 00:11:42,126
Speaker 1: There this is.

169
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,880
Speaker 1: I mean if you think when John Bonham died that was bad.

170
00:11:45,382 --> 00:11:50,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, people just they just don't get it, you know, and the thing is it's because you had like, you know.

171
00:11:50,821 --> 00:11:52,326
Speaker 0: Look at someone like Elvis, right?

172
00:11:52,446 --> 00:12:00,280
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, he made all this music and you know, he wasn't perfect and you know Always but you know, so influential and significant and whatever, right?

173
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:03,360
Speaker 0: Buddy Holly alone, right?

174
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,354
Speaker 0: He was only like a musician for a year and a half and then he died.

175
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:11,712
Speaker 0: and in that time I mean, you know, you know, everyone's heard his name.

176
00:12:11,812 --> 00:12:15,048
Speaker 0: Even if someone doesn't quite know who it is They're like, yeah, I heard that name before.

177
00:12:15,088 --> 00:12:17,480
Speaker 0: that's a famous old musician from back in the day.

178
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,239
Speaker 0: They'll know that much from someone who was only playing music for a year and a half.

179
00:12:21,682 --> 00:12:34,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, if not, if him alone had been playing music longer Right and didn't die just it would been he'd be like as big as Elvis or the Beatles or whatever, of course I mean, it's all the hindsight for all we know.

180
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:36,599
Speaker 1: They would have never made a good song again.

181
00:12:37,441 --> 00:12:38,144
Speaker 0: It's possible.

182
00:12:38,285 --> 00:12:41,280
Speaker 0: but I mean look at stuff like, you know, Ritchie Valens, right?

183
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:45,480
Speaker 0: He's known for La Bamba and you think oh, you know, he's sort of a one-hit wonder.

184
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,844
Speaker 0: Well, think about this, right?

185
00:12:46,864 --> 00:12:49,232
Speaker 0: Would he have been a one-hit wonder if he had not died?

186
00:12:49,312 --> 00:12:51,760
Speaker 0: and two even his one-hit La Bamba.

187
00:12:52,602 --> 00:12:55,845
Speaker 0: It's like a mega hit even today You know, it's.

188
00:12:56,086 --> 00:12:57,392
Speaker 1: it's one of those songs that you'll.

189
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:59,100
Speaker 1: everyone has heard it.

190
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,388
Speaker 1: You all know what it is.

191
00:13:00,449 --> 00:13:01,797
Speaker 1: Even if you have no idea who did it.

192
00:13:02,301 --> 00:13:05,153
Speaker 1: No, don't even know what era it's from but you've heard it and you know it.

193
00:13:05,354 --> 00:13:06,639
Speaker 1: you can hear it in your head right now.

194
00:13:07,002 --> 00:13:08,919
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, I hope you can.

195
00:13:10,003 --> 00:13:11,518
Speaker 0: If you can't that's pretty sad.

196
00:13:12,772 --> 00:13:14,745
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, I don't know.

197
00:13:14,785 --> 00:13:15,729
Speaker 1: maybe we're just turning into.

198
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:16,592
Speaker 0: I mean here.

199
00:13:16,632 --> 00:13:18,880
Speaker 0: think about this right a rock-and-roll band, right?

200
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,920
Speaker 0: What instruments do you have in a rock-and-roll band?

201
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,907
Speaker 1: Well, there's the bass.

202
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:34,706
Speaker 0: Yeah, and nothing else matters, of course Right now a rock-and-roll band usually has you know a drum a bass a guitar or two and if there's a second You know and then a vocalist right?

203
00:13:34,746 --> 00:13:37,860
Speaker 0: Maybe the vocalist plays the second guitar, right which is you know.

204
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:44,620
Speaker 0: But buddy Holly invented that like, you know, I guess maybe he wasn't the first ever to do that.

205
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,099
Speaker 0: But you know rock bands are that way because of a guy who played music for only a year and a half.

206
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:54,376
Speaker 1: So kids give up one of your energy during toasts or something when you're playing guitar hero.

207
00:13:54,456 --> 00:13:54,838
Speaker 1: I don't know.

208
00:13:54,998 --> 00:13:55,600
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday night.

209
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,625
Speaker 1: There's no way to tie that in.

210
00:13:56,886 --> 00:14:01,102
Speaker 0: no there and I wasn't trying to tie it in but it is too important not to be Noted.

211
00:14:01,142 --> 00:14:09,009
Speaker 1: and the punk kids because the punk kids in the forum like they know like they will celebrate the Anniversary's of things that didn't even happen a year ago.

212
00:14:09,691 --> 00:14:14,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean if you celebrate like International Day of Slayer You know, come on.

213
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:18,651
Speaker 0: I Mean while that is very important it is critical.

214
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,438
Speaker 0: In fact, yes, this is like 10,000 times.

215
00:14:22,501 --> 00:14:25,660
Speaker 1: But anyway to move right along back to video games.

216
00:14:26,384 --> 00:14:34,840
Speaker 1: For all of you who might have bought Gears of War on the PC Which probably might have not been that many people since you know, most people who play Gears of War play it on their console.

217
00:14:36,063 --> 00:14:44,593
Speaker 1: I'm sure you know now that it stopped working Due to the fact that well originally it was reported that the DRM failed.

218
00:14:44,614 --> 00:14:52,432
Speaker 1: the DRM certificate was only good Until January is an Xbox game Yeah, but the PC version is what was effective.

219
00:14:52,452 --> 00:14:53,898
Speaker 0: Oh, I didn't even know there was a PC version.

220
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:54,902
Speaker 0: That's it You know what?

221
00:14:55,143 --> 00:14:56,928
Speaker 1: I didn't either until I read this article.

222
00:14:56,948 --> 00:15:07,520
Speaker 1: All right, but apparently on January 28th That was the last day that the digital certificate that was used in the game was valid.

223
00:15:07,862 --> 00:15:10,759
Speaker 1: So from that day forward you just can't play it.

224
00:15:11,822 --> 00:15:13,050
Speaker 0: Are they gonna renew it or what?

225
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,680
Speaker 1: They said they're working on it.

226
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:18,460
Speaker 1: I have yet to find any reference to them having actually fixed it.

227
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:22,220
Speaker 0: But see the thing is if you just hack or get a pirated version you can play it, right?

228
00:15:23,021 --> 00:15:33,655
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the moral here is that if a game has DRM you should probably just pirate it Yeah, or unless the DRM is reliable like steam Yeah, but even then I've had a lot of trouble with steam.

229
00:15:33,877 --> 00:15:34,420
Speaker 1: It's so weird.

230
00:15:34,521 --> 00:15:34,943
Speaker 0: I mean like.

231
00:15:35,024 --> 00:15:36,916
Speaker 0: I'm not denying that other people have had.

232
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,560
Speaker 0: you know I've had trouble with steam because I've seen other people have trouble with steam.

233
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,580
Speaker 0: I've seen it with my own eyes because you hardly used it, but I have never had trouble with steam.

234
00:15:44,841 --> 00:15:53,714
Speaker 1: my issues I use it every day not Scott my issues primarily that I have a laptop and a desktop and Steam will randomly when it's in offline mode on the laptop.

235
00:15:54,055 --> 00:15:58,833
Speaker 1: Just freak out and say Until you get on the internet again, you can't play any of your games.

236
00:15:58,853 --> 00:16:01,405
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't use steam on a laptop I just use it on my desktop.

237
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:01,806
Speaker 0: Yeah.

238
00:16:01,887 --> 00:16:05,040
Speaker 1: Well, that's probably why you haven't run into any problem.

239
00:16:05,262 --> 00:16:07,440
Speaker 0: You're poking the bear poking the bear one.

240
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:13,580
Speaker 1: It has an offline mode and they say very specifically install it on your laptop install it on all your pcs.

241
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,891
Speaker 1: Go to a some arcade somewhere some LAN party place.

242
00:16:17,212 --> 00:16:18,817
Speaker 1: log into your account all your games.

243
00:16:19,238 --> 00:16:21,195
Speaker 1: Yeah Except when that doesn't work.

244
00:16:21,215 --> 00:16:26,011
Speaker 1: But anyway This is I don't know this borders on pathetic.

245
00:16:26,794 --> 00:16:36,049
Speaker 1: It's pretty sad and Apparently they released a statement clarifying that DRM had nothing to do with this bullshit.

246
00:16:36,631 --> 00:16:48,778
Speaker 1: that in fact, it was the anti cheat technology They have built into the game that is at fault That the thing that's supposed to prevent you from cheating at Gears of War is what is preventing you from playing it right now?

247
00:16:48,939 --> 00:16:51,038
Speaker 0: playing it at all at all at all.

248
00:16:52,001 --> 00:16:59,340
Speaker 1: granted, I remember a couple of times in the Kind of the height of cheating in games like counter-strike when punk buster was in use.

249
00:16:59,922 --> 00:17:05,141
Speaker 1: There were a couple times when things like punk buster would like randomly kick me from a game and accused me of cheating and banned Me.

250
00:17:05,161 --> 00:17:15,700
Speaker 0: yeah, but even though you know cheating at the worst They just banned you from online play like valves vac, you know valve anti cheating technology has never screwed with me.

251
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:19,540
Speaker 0: However, well vac is that but also it just permanently bans you from playing online.

252
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:22,454
Speaker 0: You can play all the counter-strike on your land that you want.

253
00:17:22,615 --> 00:17:25,810
Speaker 0: if you get vac banned You can also play on non vac servers.

254
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:30,957
Speaker 1: However, I do point out that Steam's DRM has caused a lot of problems.

255
00:17:30,997 --> 00:17:35,635
Speaker 1: particularly There was a recent update to steam and they made another update that I think fixed it.

256
00:17:35,675 --> 00:17:38,064
Speaker 1: I haven't chanced it yet Whereby?

257
00:17:38,084 --> 00:17:42,480
Speaker 1: and it only affected natural selection and a bunch of other kind of indie mod.

258
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:49,039
Speaker 0: Well, I think it's cuz those mods so heavily modded the game that it appeared as cheating, you know It's like it wasn't cheating.

259
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:59,717
Speaker 1: It was that if you were logged into those servers your steam ticket would just expire and you would be kicked Which in a game like NS is is devastating.

260
00:17:59,797 --> 00:18:00,420
Speaker 0: That's pretty bad.

261
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:00,802
Speaker 0: Like it got

262
00:18:00,822 --> 00:18:02,149
Speaker 1: to the point where I say an alien

263
00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:04,641
Speaker 0: with a bunch of rez going onos and you get kicked what

264
00:18:04,681 --> 00:18:13,674
Speaker 1: I would do is I'd save up rez and cuz when you log back in and get your rez back and then as Soon as I had too much rez and I just been kicked I'd log back in I'd gorge it.

265
00:18:13,794 --> 00:18:16,473
Speaker 1: I'd built like 10 brocees brocees.

266
00:18:17,343 --> 00:18:22,906
Speaker 1: So think the map was all like they like the Marines would be like, all right Everybody heavy now.

267
00:18:22,966 --> 00:18:25,116
Speaker 1: We got five minutes before you all get steamed.

268
00:18:25,257 --> 00:18:25,760
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

269
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,487
Speaker 1: But I've DRM like people.

270
00:18:30,627 --> 00:18:43,148
Speaker 1: anyone who apologizes for it or says but without DRM people would fire it or Without DRM like DRM is the only way just suck it up or DRM doesn't really cause problems or you know It has problems all the time.

271
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:45,476
Speaker 0: people who come have DRM have all these problems.

272
00:18:45,516 --> 00:18:47,022
Speaker 0: people who pirate never have any Complaints.

273
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,889
Speaker 1: Yes, this is a problem.

274
00:18:48,909 --> 00:18:55,700
Speaker 1: Plus couple this with all the studies pointing out that People like the 98% piracy rates of some games.

275
00:18:56,741 --> 00:19:00,216
Speaker 1: Maybe those people wouldn't have played the game if they had to pay for in the first place.

276
00:19:00,297 --> 00:19:00,980
Speaker 0: So it's exactly.

277
00:19:01,843 --> 00:19:10,457
Speaker 0: Valve actually has said, you know some people at valve where there was a recent story that they were like Look, we had all this piracy in Russia, right crazy piracy in Russia.

278
00:19:10,477 --> 00:19:11,099
Speaker 0: So what did they do?

279
00:19:11,701 --> 00:19:26,991
Speaker 0: They went and they decided well first of all, let's translate our games to Russian Right and second of all, let's release them in Russia the same day we released them everywhere else, you know on Steam and You know for the same reasonable prices not for up higher lower prices.

280
00:19:27,052 --> 00:19:31,395
Speaker 0: and you know what happened a lot of people in Russia Bought the game and didn't pirate it.

281
00:19:32,642 --> 00:19:36,695
Speaker 0: The opinion of valve is that a pirate is an underserved customer.

282
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:40,315
Speaker 0: either your price is too high for them Or you're not serving them in some way.

283
00:19:40,335 --> 00:19:47,840
Speaker 0: yet They still want to play your game on some level But they don't you know, they don't want to play it badly enough to pay for it or something else.

284
00:19:47,940 --> 00:20:08,389
Speaker 1: So I think part of that is coming from the fact that there is so much free legal or disposable or so cheap That it doesn't matter entertainment, especially in video games already that if a game isn't good like if a new game comes out and it is not good enough to Like to force you to want it This is a game you have to play like.

285
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:11,100
Speaker 1: when Left 4 Dead came out you pretty much had to play it.

286
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,426
Speaker 1: That was a fantastic game for a while.

287
00:20:13,747 --> 00:20:13,887
Speaker 1: Yeah.

288
00:20:13,928 --> 00:20:21,624
Speaker 1: Well, but every game fades in the end except counter-strike and natural selection and tribes, too If and mega man.

289
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:31,414
Speaker 1: if a game isn't good enough and there's a hundred games that are all kind of mediocre No punk kid cares enough about any one of them to pay for it.

290
00:20:31,795 --> 00:20:35,079
Speaker 1: if they can play it for free They'll play it for five minutes and then they'll dump it.

291
00:20:35,461 --> 00:20:40,539
Speaker 0: Yeah, even I did a whole when spore we came out and it was the early release and all the piracy and all the DRM.

292
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,823
Speaker 0: Remember the whole fiasco.

293
00:20:41,863 --> 00:20:45,594
Speaker 0: I put a poll in our forum and I know a forum poll is not.

294
00:20:45,734 --> 00:20:49,780
Speaker 0: anything is not better than anecdotal evidence you kidding is basically worthless.

295
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:59,120
Speaker 0: geeknights forum polls are 100% statistically significant Right They five percent even though I recognize that right?

296
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:25,560
Speaker 0: I still I I honestly do believe that the results of that poll represent reality that there the number of pirates that actually would have bought the game if piracy were not possible and because piracy is possible will not buy the game is such an insignificant Tiny tiny tiny tiny percentage as to be effectively like zero or one percent.

297
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:31,940
Speaker 1: Well, the problem with spore in particular was that the demo gave me everything I wanted out of that game.

298
00:21:32,221 --> 00:21:34,008
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the demo?

299
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:36,660
Speaker 1: I was a little excited but then, you know, I waited for the game to come out.

300
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:45,180
Speaker 0: That was I think that might have been the the greatest Disproportion between hype and reality ever other than I don't know Daikatana.

301
00:21:45,881 --> 00:21:47,789
Speaker 0: Daikatana didn't have as much hype as spore.

302
00:21:48,211 --> 00:21:50,099
Speaker 0: Ah, it was worse than spore.

303
00:21:51,106 --> 00:21:52,840
Speaker 1: But the tricky part is the disparity.

304
00:21:53,001 --> 00:21:54,686
Speaker 1: I mean if a game is so bad.

305
00:21:54,887 --> 00:21:58,900
Speaker 1: any amount of hype leads that number into the realms of the infinite.

306
00:21:59,842 --> 00:22:00,859
Speaker 0: Spore wasn't good.

307
00:22:02,881 --> 00:22:05,330
Speaker 1: Plus I point out that it's kind of like inflation.

308
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:12,197
Speaker 1: you have to account for how much hype there was back Then compared to the size of the PC gaming industry.

309
00:22:12,277 --> 00:22:12,900
Speaker 0: It's tough one.

310
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,847
Speaker 1: I mean, you know that was he.

311
00:22:14,907 --> 00:22:18,760
Speaker 0: in a way PC gaming is bigger back then but in a way it's smaller.

312
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:21,677
Speaker 1: Yeah stuff anyway, I mean back then the hype.

313
00:22:21,697 --> 00:22:31,346
Speaker 1: but seriously this happens too often for people to continue to make the argument that DRM is Okay, as long as it's done correctly.

314
00:22:31,386 --> 00:22:34,014
Speaker 1: because the moral here is that it's not done correctly.

315
00:22:34,034 --> 00:22:35,820
Speaker 1: and this happens all the time.

316
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:48,054
Speaker 0: Yeah Alright, so on steam right now speaking of right there is a beta of a game a Warhammer 40k RTS game called dawn of war 2 and it's.

317
00:22:48,736 --> 00:22:51,687
Speaker 0: they call it a beta But really it's a demo.

318
00:22:51,867 --> 00:22:55,700
Speaker 0: and at the end of the demo it asks you to pre-order the real game, right?

319
00:22:56,464 --> 00:22:59,580
Speaker 0: And all this demo lets you do is play multiplayer.

320
00:22:59,861 --> 00:23:01,609
Speaker 0: That's all it lets you do and he uses.

321
00:23:01,931 --> 00:23:03,980
Speaker 0: it's so weird because he uses games for Windows.

322
00:23:04,443 --> 00:23:07,160
Speaker 0: So it's like you got games or windows and then steam on top of it.

323
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:11,077
Speaker 0: So it's like I got both things going on for the same exact game.

324
00:23:11,117 --> 00:23:11,739
Speaker 0: It's really weird.

325
00:23:12,505 --> 00:23:14,360
Speaker 0: But so I it was free beta.

326
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:19,040
Speaker 0: So even though I'm not a you know, I'm not I sort of hate RTS's and that most of them.

327
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,460
Speaker 0: I mean, I like the idea of a real-time game that is strategic.

328
00:23:22,703 --> 00:23:24,019
Speaker 0: That's like the greatest thing in the world.

329
00:23:24,642 --> 00:23:34,159
Speaker 0: but most RTS's end up being who can click the fastest who can remember the exact best sequence of things and Maybe we should do a show on what it would take to make a good RTS.

330
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,387
Speaker 0: Anyway, so this game was free.

331
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:39,517
Speaker 0: So I figured well might as well give it a shot.

332
00:23:39,577 --> 00:23:43,335
Speaker 0: right at the worst It's just another click fast rights and then I could just delete it.

333
00:23:43,435 --> 00:23:44,320
Speaker 0: It didn't cost me anything.

334
00:23:44,963 --> 00:23:46,914
Speaker 0: So I downloaded and I played it a few times.

335
00:23:46,974 --> 00:23:52,020
Speaker 0: and I played it enough times To sort of learn how it works because there's no tutorial or anything.

336
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:58,727
Speaker 0: So you sort of have to just sort of keep playing with it and keep poking buttons or to you know figure out what's going on.

337
00:23:58,807 --> 00:24:05,307
Speaker 0: and you know, I sort of played it enough to learn the deal and It's better than other RTS's.

338
00:24:05,367 --> 00:24:15,087
Speaker 0: I've played in a lot of ways, you know in the but in many ways it's also the same old same old right and Basically, I'll just real quick.

339
00:24:15,127 --> 00:24:16,493
Speaker 0: You don't build any buildings.

340
00:24:16,514 --> 00:24:17,840
Speaker 0: You have one building, right?

341
00:24:18,841 --> 00:24:21,060
Speaker 0: I also kind of like building building course.

342
00:24:21,241 --> 00:24:33,039
Speaker 1: That was always the problem because whenever I played counter not counter-strike command and conquer You'd build all the buildings never go anywhere and then tanks just come over the horizon Exactly, or usually I played with other people who were like me.

343
00:24:33,601 --> 00:24:40,439
Speaker 1: So we both build giant bases and never actually attack each other and then the modem connection would usually pan out.

344
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,105
Speaker 1: or Peter Right about.

345
00:24:42,226 --> 00:24:50,395
Speaker 0: as you have this one building, right and you can upgrade the building twice And basically all you do is you have two kinds of resources.

346
00:24:50,435 --> 00:24:51,920
Speaker 0: Well three resources actually.

347
00:24:52,562 --> 00:24:56,131
Speaker 0: First for resource three resources fanatical devotion.

348
00:24:56,151 --> 00:25:00,142
Speaker 0: There's the triangle right which I think is like command or something I don't know.

349
00:25:00,162 --> 00:25:03,742
Speaker 0: It's triangle lightning bolt, which is energy and People.

350
00:25:04,284 --> 00:25:07,576
Speaker 0: you always have a hundred P or 99 people or whatever it is.

351
00:25:07,616 --> 00:25:09,832
Speaker 0: You can't get more than that You can't get less than that.

352
00:25:09,913 --> 00:25:10,499
Speaker 0: That's what you have.

353
00:25:12,021 --> 00:25:14,871
Speaker 0: You and the to get triangles and electricities.

354
00:25:14,891 --> 00:25:17,540
Speaker 0: you have to capture these spots on the map, right?

355
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:26,880
Speaker 0: So you start off with one hero guy and one troop, you know Which is like four guys together like a little squad and you send them out to go capture things, right?

356
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,540
Speaker 0: So you capture a little power plant and now it starts generating more lightning bolts.

357
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:38,773
Speaker 0: You capture a triangle command point it starts generating more triangles for you And you can use the triangles and lightning bolts to build more guys.

358
00:25:39,235 --> 00:25:46,298
Speaker 0: and every time you build more guys Those guys eat up some of your people so you can never have more guys on the board that equal 99 people.

359
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,273
Speaker 0: It's like a squad of scouts might only cost you five people.

360
00:25:50,293 --> 00:25:52,100
Speaker 0: so you can have a huge army of scouts.

361
00:25:52,762 --> 00:25:57,940
Speaker 0: But maybe like, you know a giant robot cost 15 people so you can't have too many of those, right?

362
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:58,905
Speaker 0: And it doesn't.

363
00:25:58,925 --> 00:25:59,914
Speaker 0: you can't really have anything.

364
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:09,440
Speaker 0: commit suicide But you can send it out to die and get killed by the other teams if you need, you know to get some people back And you can also spend your points to upgrade guys.

365
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:14,100
Speaker 0: So like let's say I build a normal troop a squad of tactical soldiers.

366
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:26,680
Speaker 0: I could upgrade them with like plasma guns or something for like, you know some number of lightning bolts and triangles and whatever Uh-huh, and then basically all you do is you order your guys to go around the map and you can give them orders.

367
00:26:26,761 --> 00:26:28,840
Speaker 0: You know like attack run away.

368
00:26:29,402 --> 00:26:35,520
Speaker 0: You know defend these sorts of things right and you want to get of course more triangle and lightning bolt spaces.

369
00:26:36,223 --> 00:26:38,351
Speaker 0: Not let the other guys take away your triangles.

370
00:26:38,411 --> 00:26:40,660
Speaker 0: lightning bolts minimize how many they have.

371
00:26:41,081 --> 00:26:48,279
Speaker 0: But most of all there are three spots on the board at least depending on the board I guess map that are the victory point things.

372
00:26:48,761 --> 00:26:54,000
Speaker 0: so when you get those you're gonna start getting victory points, right and on.

373
00:26:54,482 --> 00:26:58,119
Speaker 0: everyone starts I think with like 500 victory points, I don't remember the number.

374
00:26:58,139 --> 00:27:08,327
Speaker 0: and If someone else the other guy has more victory point things than you then you start losing Points, uh-huh.

375
00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:15,820
Speaker 0: And basically it's a. it's a thing that pushes left and right back and forth Right and whoever goes down to zero first is the loser.

376
00:27:17,101 --> 00:27:23,479
Speaker 0: so you basically have to control more of the victory point spots than the other guy for a longer time in order to win.

377
00:27:23,499 --> 00:27:27,453
Speaker 0: and You know at a certain point when the other guys down to zero you win.

378
00:27:27,473 --> 00:27:30,218
Speaker 0: or if you're down to zero and he's still at One then he wins.

379
00:27:30,561 --> 00:27:34,072
Speaker 1: So the operative question is is it good or in the?

380
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:36,179
Speaker 1: you know as the internet wants on a one to ten?

381
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,360
Speaker 1: Does it get an 8.5?

382
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:44,540
Speaker 0: Well, as I said, you know it, you know, it's a little bit better than other RTS as I've played in the past.

383
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,047
Speaker 0: You know, you know like the click fests and such.

384
00:27:47,127 --> 00:27:49,173
Speaker 0: but it's not perfect.

385
00:27:49,193 --> 00:27:53,845
Speaker 0: You know, a lot of it is just you know Sort of a rock-paper-scissors.

386
00:27:53,865 --> 00:27:58,539
Speaker 0: a lot of it is, you know a quick clicking like, you know quickly get over to where.

387
00:27:58,579 --> 00:28:00,559
Speaker 0: you know You have to manage units all over the board.

388
00:28:01,001 --> 00:28:04,011
Speaker 0: So it's like, you know those guys up top you tell them to fight and take cover.

389
00:28:04,373 --> 00:28:09,113
Speaker 0: you go down low and you know You tell some guys to run away regroup and come back in.

390
00:28:09,173 --> 00:28:10,440
Speaker 0: meanwhile something happened up top.

391
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,656
Speaker 0: You didn't get up there fast enough to do anything about it.

392
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:19,640
Speaker 0: or you know You spend some resources to upgrade some guys with a particular weapon and you tell them to go in.

393
00:28:20,262 --> 00:28:26,305
Speaker 0: So the only guy switches he has some one guy run away and bring some other troops in and there's a little rock-paper-scissors Going on.

394
00:28:26,506 --> 00:28:35,160
Speaker 1: see I guess I really the RTS I want is one that's imperfect information kind of like, you know, giving orders to units with good AI and real slow.

395
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:39,380
Speaker 1: So it's real time but you kind of react in a more realistic real time.

396
00:28:39,621 --> 00:28:42,359
Speaker 0: What the one good thing I can say about it is that?

397
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:55,109
Speaker 0: When you give orders of where they got to tell the guys to go somewhere or do something They're significantly smarter about it than I they have been in the past and in other RTS I played and in fact quite often you're.

398
00:28:55,149 --> 00:29:11,520
Speaker 0: what you're gonna do is you're gonna tell your units to either most of the orders I gave for either run away when there's a big exclamation point when you push that your guys run away and Immediately and they also get like a huge defensive boost when they have the exclamation point.

399
00:29:11,943 --> 00:29:14,400
Speaker 0: So running away with the exclamation point is like the best way to go.

400
00:29:14,641 --> 00:29:18,352
Speaker 1: No more days of my own troops being run over by my harvester exactly.

401
00:29:18,593 --> 00:29:29,481
Speaker 0: and to when you tell guys to go somewhere You're usually either telling them to capture a point which they just do right or you're telling them to stand somewhere and take Cover.

402
00:29:29,943 --> 00:29:35,260
Speaker 0: and when you tell someone to take cover these like dots actually show up like let's say there's a wall, right?

403
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:49,240
Speaker 0: Move my mouse over near the wall and you'll see like let's say I'm telling four guys a squad of four You'll see like four green dots appear around the wall And if I click that's where my four guys are gonna be and that's where they're gonna take cover.

404
00:29:49,882 --> 00:29:55,397
Speaker 0: So they can actually take cover and all these like cool positions on the map wherever this stuff and you can.

405
00:29:55,498 --> 00:30:07,440
Speaker 0: actually what was really Cool is I had a giant robot and I just told him to walk across the map to this point I wanted and he crushed all these walls and things as he was walking does destroying places for people to take cover.

406
00:30:08,122 --> 00:30:08,764
Speaker 0: So there was.

407
00:30:08,885 --> 00:30:23,283
Speaker 0: there was definitely an element of taking cover destroying things that you can take cover around Coming in at angles which are not, you know easy for the other, you know The enemy to have defended well that that sort of thing Uh-huh.

408
00:30:23,765 --> 00:30:32,094
Speaker 0: So maybe you should install it while it's still free and we can play some you know Against each other where we're not awesome and gonna kill each other easily.

409
00:30:32,114 --> 00:30:32,777
Speaker 0: We'll see.

410
00:30:32,817 --> 00:30:33,218
Speaker 1: We'll see.

411
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,862
Speaker 1: I have a lot of so you know have a lot of command and conquer under my belt on a 486.

412
00:30:38,862 --> 00:30:40,770
Speaker 0: Also, you know Warhammer people like it.

413
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,518
Speaker 0: It is very Warhammer 40k.

414
00:30:42,699 --> 00:30:45,059
Speaker 0: very It's like Space Marines all the way.

415
00:30:51,675 --> 00:30:56,796
Speaker 1: but anyway things of the day I Subscribed to Nintendo power I had.

416
00:30:56,816 --> 00:31:01,030
Speaker 1: I got every issue up until the n64 era and then I gave up on it.

417
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:03,115
Speaker 0: I did not subscribe to Nintendo power.

418
00:31:03,316 --> 00:31:06,043
Speaker 1: In fact, I subscribed from day one.

419
00:31:06,063 --> 00:31:08,490
Speaker 1: You're looking at someone who got dragon warrior.

420
00:31:09,032 --> 00:31:11,903
Speaker 0: I subscribed to game pro and recently I got rid of them all.

421
00:31:12,526 --> 00:31:13,490
Speaker 0: they were taken up space.

422
00:31:13,651 --> 00:31:15,157
Speaker 1: Yeah, my Nintendo powers.

423
00:31:15,258 --> 00:31:18,010
Speaker 1: I either my brother has them or my mother has them.

424
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:21,105
Speaker 0: But my brother has some Nintendo powers from the n64 era.

425
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:30,534
Speaker 1: But of all the Nintendo powers what I treasure more than anything is I actually have two copies of it the Final Fantasy 1 Complete strategy guy.

426
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,763
Speaker 0: I had the Mario 3 strategy guy.

427
00:31:32,783 --> 00:31:33,345
Speaker 1: that one too.

428
00:31:33,466 --> 00:31:34,610
Speaker 0: That one was like the best.

429
00:31:34,911 --> 00:31:35,796
Speaker 0: I wish I still had it.

430
00:31:35,856 --> 00:31:36,539
Speaker 1: I have it too.

431
00:31:37,242 --> 00:31:38,528
Speaker 1: All that historical is on.

432
00:31:38,729 --> 00:31:40,698
Speaker 0: first It was on cardboard and you like it's.

433
00:31:40,739 --> 00:31:44,323
Speaker 0: you saw where the hammer suit was and I was like, holy shit Hammersuit is real.

434
00:31:44,343 --> 00:31:49,444
Speaker 1: Holy shit but it had all that good art in it and it had all the maps of every level.

435
00:31:49,585 --> 00:31:53,355
Speaker 1: it had all those historical things like Which Mario was fastest.

436
00:31:53,395 --> 00:31:54,658
Speaker 1: who jumped the furthest.

437
00:31:54,719 --> 00:31:59,270
Speaker 0: check out this Mario - I mean like game facts sort of defeat strategy guys nowadays.

438
00:31:59,753 --> 00:32:02,270
Speaker 0: But Pete when people make game facts, it's all text.

439
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:07,610
Speaker 0: No, you never have that, you know that here are the maps of every level going on on game facts.

440
00:32:07,811 --> 00:32:13,241
Speaker 0: I really think someone people who make game facts should start You know up in their Annie make PDFs with the graphics.

441
00:32:13,261 --> 00:32:19,610
Speaker 1: Come on, you know, but game facts They go for that very specific aesthetic of crap punk kid written.

442
00:32:19,631 --> 00:32:28,730
Speaker 1: I mean Every game back has like the beginning part where they draw like an ASCII picture of the controller and they're like Press this to open the menu and this is the B button.

443
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:39,483
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then whenever they describe like the one thing that you're trying to figure out and you can't really tell what they're talking about Okay, I Was looking up where to find.

444
00:32:39,543 --> 00:32:43,890
Speaker 0: like one of the villagers I could never like jump up to the platform and then go right and then go down.

445
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:45,340
Speaker 0: It's like well, there's like three platforms.

446
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,770
Speaker 0: I can go right and down from all of them.

447
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:47,031
Speaker 0: What?

448
00:32:47,051 --> 00:32:51,370
Speaker 1: because all the game facts now most of them are written in this walkthrough format.

449
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:56,530
Speaker 1: It's like who is so sad that you want a walkthrough of a whole game?

450
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:04,325
Speaker 1: Game facts should be for the time where you don't know where the last bath madad is and you don't want to spend an hour Hitting every wall with holy water.

451
00:33:04,547 --> 00:33:06,397
Speaker 1: Yep That is the only thing it should.

452
00:33:06,498 --> 00:33:11,430
Speaker 0: it's like when you do a strategy guide right for anything What you want to do is you want to compartmentalize?

453
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:12,071
Speaker 0: Everything.

454
00:33:12,111 --> 00:33:18,949
Speaker 0: that way if anyone skims to any part of the fact they can just read that part Individually and know what to do.

455
00:33:19,091 --> 00:33:34,450
Speaker 0: So like if you're talking about the beginning, you know The secret in the middle of level 8 the language when you talk about how to get that secret should assume that somebody Started reading at that sentence and didn't read this, you know, the sentences before and the sentences before that, you know.

456
00:33:34,972 --> 00:33:39,450
Speaker 0: It's like you can't use words like go to the next platform because they don't know what the previous platform was.

457
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:50,090
Speaker 1: But anyway, the the cool thing like I remember one thing in that strategy guide They actually had a list of all the different death and it like animations and death sprites of Mario through the years.

458
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:55,057
Speaker 1: You don't need stuff like that Nintendo power in the early days at least.

459
00:33:55,097 --> 00:34:03,450
Speaker 1: I don't know what it turned into later because obviously N64 is when I gave up on consoles and went PC all the way until the end of the GameCube era.

460
00:34:04,898 --> 00:34:11,889
Speaker 1: But pretty much These Nintendo power had a lot of like art and video game stuff in it.

461
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:16,690
Speaker 1: That wasn't just strategy guides and I really enjoyed reading Nintendo power when I was a punk.

462
00:34:16,851 --> 00:34:19,583
Speaker 0: I enjoyed reading game pro when I was a punk kid before it sucked.

463
00:34:19,945 --> 00:34:20,909
Speaker 1: see game pro.

464
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:22,054
Speaker 1: I was never a big fan of.

465
00:34:22,235 --> 00:34:30,905
Speaker 0: I think people people like to disrespect game pro But they don't remember the earliest days when you know, it was scary Larry and such.

466
00:34:31,106 --> 00:34:32,489
Speaker 1: I never liked scary Larry.

467
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:32,992
Speaker 1: You know what?

468
00:34:33,012 --> 00:34:34,638
Speaker 0: I found out about scary Larry.

469
00:34:34,658 --> 00:34:36,605
Speaker 0: You know what he does now scares people.

470
00:34:36,686 --> 00:34:37,870
Speaker 0: He's the boss of Pokemon.

471
00:34:38,891 --> 00:34:39,974
Speaker 1: Huh kind of makes sense.

472
00:34:40,214 --> 00:34:41,378
Speaker 1: Yeah in a twisted way.

473
00:34:41,598 --> 00:34:42,040
Speaker 0: He runs.

474
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:43,322
Speaker 0: He runs us scary.

475
00:34:43,362 --> 00:34:43,724
Speaker 1: Larry.

476
00:34:43,744 --> 00:34:45,650
Speaker 1: Scott had nothing on coconut monkey.

477
00:34:46,976 --> 00:34:50,034
Speaker 0: coconut monkey Arms no legs.

478
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:54,730
Speaker 1: I also had PC gamer and the fact that he cheated at his own games.

479
00:34:55,091 --> 00:34:56,800
Speaker 1: I know right and that was the only way to win.

480
00:34:56,981 --> 00:34:58,610
Speaker 0: I have a PC gamer CD somewhere.

481
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:01,319
Speaker 0: I wonder if it'll work and we can get coconut monkeys on there.

482
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,146
Speaker 1: I have PC gamer floppy disks.

483
00:35:03,788 --> 00:35:08,075
Speaker 1: Whoa I was.

484
00:35:08,095 --> 00:35:09,221
Speaker 1: I was into that stuff.

485
00:35:09,261 --> 00:35:12,857
Speaker 1: Anyway, I Have two YouTube videos for you.

486
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:15,206
Speaker 1: The first is an ad for Nintendo power.

487
00:35:15,266 --> 00:35:21,549
Speaker 1: Let me tell you if Anything could be iconic of the year 1986 it is this ad.

488
00:35:22,212 --> 00:35:26,904
Speaker 1: Every ad on TV for kids looked exactly like this Nintendo power.

489
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:30,194
Speaker 0: the TV shows on TV looked exactly Like that commercial.

490
00:35:30,555 --> 00:35:34,990
Speaker 0: Oh my the things they told you will be right back after this commercial looked exactly like that commercial.

491
00:35:35,232 --> 00:35:37,330
Speaker 1: It's it's it's frightening to watch it again.

492
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:55,359
Speaker 1: And then as a bonus prize in case you've already seen this which I hope you would have seen it in 1986 like I did Someone made a YouTube video of like every cover of every Nintendo power in order and That brought back a lot of nostalgia.

493
00:35:55,379 --> 00:35:58,350
Speaker 1: Like I remember every single one of those issues.

494
00:35:58,632 --> 00:36:00,828
Speaker 1: I could probably tell you what else was in them.

495
00:36:01,873 --> 00:36:07,250
Speaker 0: I think it just really helps you sort of get a better grip on the chronology, you know, cuz it sort of blurs together.

496
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,868
Speaker 0: It's like well what came first?

497
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:16,710
Speaker 1: Zelda 1 Megaman 2 Metroid Nintendo power had original awesome cover art for the longest time.

498
00:36:16,851 --> 00:36:18,450
Speaker 1: Yeah It doesn't seem to have it so much anymore.

499
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:29,547
Speaker 1: But back then like they were famous for the fact that kids had nightmares about the live-action like photographic scene They made of Simon having murdered Dracula for the second time.

500
00:36:29,748 --> 00:36:34,510
Speaker 0: that is I mean You know video game magazines were a lot like video game instruction books, right?

501
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:40,614
Speaker 0: They used to have be like works of art into and of themselves and have lots and lots of original Illustrations.

502
00:36:40,654 --> 00:36:44,171
Speaker 1: and a lot of people ask me why I throw away the instruction books to games I buy.

503
00:36:44,211 --> 00:36:54,020
Speaker 1: now I have a bin of like old NES instruction books like Legend of Zelda and go go 13 and these Instruction manuals had awesome original art.

504
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,330
Speaker 1: They were like 30 pages long full color with backstories.

505
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,798
Speaker 0: Oh, the one came with a math.

506
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, I see I have my sieve to manual.

507
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:06,065
Speaker 1: It's a book the the instruction book that came with a certain unnamed DS game.

508
00:37:06,105 --> 00:37:06,787
Speaker 1: I bought recently.

509
00:37:06,827 --> 00:37:16,544
Speaker 1: It wasn't tactics advance It was another DS game was like a four-page Black-and-white turn the game on book in four languages.

510
00:37:16,965 --> 00:37:20,193
Speaker 1: Yeah, like it was pathetic Nintendo power.

511
00:37:20,213 --> 00:37:28,960
Speaker 1: I salute you even though you were basically just a marketing machine for Nintendo much like the wizard Alright.

512
00:37:29,001 --> 00:37:38,344
Speaker 0: so also speaking of Mario Some people on reddit made a made a series of images called Mario explains it.

513
00:37:38,444 --> 00:37:40,770
Speaker 0: relationships, right Mario explains it all.

514
00:37:40,977 --> 00:37:41,190
Speaker 0: Yeah.

515
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:50,211
Speaker 0: So basically they they use the Mario level as a metaphor for things that are true or stereotypically True.

516
00:37:50,673 --> 00:38:04,137
Speaker 0: So the first image in the series is a picture of Mario and he's on the ground Right as a big pit and then there's some more ground But that ground is way up high so high Mario can't possibly jump up there.

517
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:13,074
Speaker 0: and there's two labels and the label to the low ground is friendship and the label on the high ground is Relationship.

518
00:38:13,194 --> 00:38:15,303
Speaker 1: you pretty much just have to look at these.

519
00:38:15,363 --> 00:38:17,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm only describing the first one.

520
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:18,554
Speaker 0: But do you see how?

521
00:38:18,915 --> 00:38:23,650
Speaker 0: so, you know the the picture the design of this fake Mario level?

522
00:38:24,232 --> 00:38:29,270
Speaker 0: You know is a metaphor that symbolizes, you know something that is stereotypically true.

523
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:33,406
Speaker 0: if you are friends, you'll never be in a relationship because Mario can't jump that high.

524
00:38:34,309 --> 00:38:42,009
Speaker 0: and basically a bunch of other people came along and took this image and expanded it and expanded it and expanded it.

525
00:38:42,029 --> 00:38:48,889
Speaker 0: and Usually when you know, you've heard of people saying you took the metaphor too far, you know Like it sort of starts to not work anymore.

526
00:38:49,992 --> 00:38:51,461
Speaker 0: It never doesn't work anymore.

527
00:38:51,481 --> 00:38:55,655
Speaker 0: It just continues to work more And it's pretty hilarious.

528
00:38:56,136 --> 00:39:03,338
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's kind of stereotypical humor much like the old ladder theory website was but It's cleverly done and funny.

529
00:39:03,378 --> 00:39:18,413
Speaker 1: It reminds me of what Photoshop Fridays used to be like In a big way like it harkens back to the days of just people Taking a meme or an idea and extending it well beyond what was tasteful for much hilarity Mm-hmm,

530
00:39:18,533 --> 00:39:18,774
Speaker 0: but

531
00:39:19,195 --> 00:39:25,805
Speaker 1: we were talking about something very brief tonight since it's not actually a Tuesday gig nights And we screwed up and I kind of want to go to bed.

532
00:39:25,825 --> 00:39:32,910
Speaker 1: Mmm We're gonna actually review gravity bone, which we talked about very briefly the other last Tuesday.

533
00:39:33,525 --> 00:39:48,162
Speaker 0: Yep so gravity bone was his indie PC FPS game that I heard about and it was getting some talk on the Internet's and then I Played it and then just now rim played it and it's a real short game But I think it's a real good game

534
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:48,886
Speaker 1: like literally.

535
00:39:48,946 --> 00:39:49,770
Speaker 1: I came home from work.

536
00:39:50,271 --> 00:39:55,205
Speaker 1: I was I started I turned the game on and I heard Scott pulling up in the driveway.

537
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:59,397
Speaker 1: I beat the game Like five minutes later.

538
00:39:59,417 --> 00:40:00,440
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

539
00:40:01,422 --> 00:40:02,686
Speaker 1: It was pretty entertaining.

540
00:40:02,786 --> 00:40:04,030
Speaker 1: I thoroughly enjoyed it.

541
00:40:04,351 --> 00:40:06,305
Speaker 1: It was a lot better than our multi-winning.

542
00:40:06,608 --> 00:40:12,950
Speaker 0: Yeah I think one thing that to say about gravity bone right is that unlike some other indie games?

543
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:17,905
Speaker 0: It gets all the basics right, you know, the graphics are smooth the game works.

544
00:40:18,227 --> 00:40:19,310
Speaker 0: You can set any resolution.

545
00:40:20,211 --> 00:40:22,618
Speaker 0: You know that you can customize your controls.

546
00:40:22,899 --> 00:40:24,685
Speaker 0: The controls are smooth.

547
00:40:24,725 --> 00:40:26,391
Speaker 1: Well, dude, it's based on quake 2.

548
00:40:26,391 --> 00:40:28,049
Speaker 1: It uses the straight-up quake 2 engine.

549
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:32,210
Speaker 1: So literally you turn it on and I can just go into a menu and change all my controls.

550
00:40:32,371 --> 00:40:32,652
Speaker 1: I did.

551
00:40:33,316 --> 00:40:39,130
Speaker 1: this is this is what bothers me about a lot of new games Especially a lot of indie games that try to be cool or try to be clever.

552
00:40:39,573 --> 00:40:58,830
Speaker 1: they might do something awesome and innovative or like multi-winning you but Every PC game I have ever bought in my entire life that I've ever played in my entire life The first thing I do after it is installed when I turn it on when I'm first playing is hit escape click on options customize my controls.

553
00:41:00,212 --> 00:41:07,008
Speaker 1: The fact that a lot of modern indie games don't have that option It's like a step 10 years back.

554
00:41:07,874 --> 00:41:11,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean not even 20 because 10 years ago every game did that.

555
00:41:11,231 --> 00:41:22,650
Speaker 0: I mean I can understand unlike a console game not letting someone customize the controls But on the PC customize the controls is sort of a necessity because you know, you've got you know a mouse and keyboard.

556
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:28,590
Speaker 0: You know, some people like the arrows some people use the WASD some people like an inverted mouse, you know.

557
00:41:29,031 --> 00:41:42,670
Speaker 0: And while the you know, even if you just just have the option and keep it in a menu Just you don't have to put it up front, you know, you know 90% of the people won't customize the controls and but it takes what like a couple hours to add that functionality in.

558
00:41:43,352 --> 00:41:46,043
Speaker 0: You know, it's not a difficult thing so just do it.

559
00:41:46,525 --> 00:41:52,787
Speaker 1: but this game of course We're not going to quote-unquote spoil it because there are spoilers and it's a five-minute game.

560
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:55,294
Speaker 0: Yeah It's got hard.

561
00:41:55,996 --> 00:41:56,619
Speaker 1: It's a game.

562
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:01,736
Speaker 1: Literally you kind of just sit down and Play it without knowing anything.

563
00:42:01,756 --> 00:42:05,910
Speaker 1: I have no idea what it's about and it's a game that will teach you what to do.

564
00:42:07,472 --> 00:42:11,047
Speaker 1: Let you do it and then gives you a big payoff at the end for it.

565
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:14,177
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm It's all style and all class.

566
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:18,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, and not in the not not class like our gecky got panel.

567
00:42:18,671 --> 00:42:20,649
Speaker 1: We're talking class in the non-ironic sense.

568
00:42:21,051 --> 00:42:22,637
Speaker 1: Yeah, that has to be said we've been.

569
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:26,090
Speaker 1: the word class has come to mean something very odd in the front row crew.

570
00:42:26,651 --> 00:42:35,605
Speaker 0: Well, what I think I like about it is it gives you sort of equal parts puzzle solving equal parts, you know Manipulating the world in a fun way.

571
00:42:35,766 --> 00:42:39,258
Speaker 0: equal parts Platforming a little bit of exploration.

572
00:42:39,338 --> 00:42:42,589
Speaker 0: Yeah a little bit of exploring also, it's odd.

573
00:42:43,632 --> 00:42:53,317
Speaker 1: the second mission is odd like odd to a degree that would almost be disturbing but in this Wonderful deliciously odd way.

574
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:56,846
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it also has I think you know a chase scene.

575
00:42:56,906 --> 00:43:05,461
Speaker 0: and the thing about the chase scene Right is that I can't remember a video game that had like a good Chase seed it would actually played the chase scene in this game.

576
00:43:05,501 --> 00:43:08,030
Speaker 0: I was like, wow, that was a fucking awesome chase scene.

577
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:10,330
Speaker 0: How come no other game has a chase scene like this?

578
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:12,296
Speaker 1: I mean, obviously there's some scripted bits.

579
00:43:12,376 --> 00:43:16,049
Speaker 0: five mini game has a better chase scene than any professionally made game ever.

580
00:43:16,109 --> 00:43:20,228
Speaker 1: Seriously I think that was the best chase scene I've ever played in a game ever.

581
00:43:20,469 --> 00:43:27,870
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean any game even games that are designed around chasing people have not been able to attain the chase scene in this game.

582
00:43:28,058 --> 00:43:29,856
Speaker 0: Yeah What happens when you have a chase scene?

583
00:43:29,876 --> 00:43:36,190
Speaker 0: in a lot of games either a it's one of those incredibly annoying chases We're like, it's impossible to catch up, right?

584
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:43,335
Speaker 1: It's a Mario Sunshine where you're like, I'll just kind of wait like to sit there invisible waiting for you No matter what you screw off.

585
00:43:43,355 --> 00:43:44,058
Speaker 1: You just go get him.

586
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,730
Speaker 0: Yep, or it's not really a chase.

587
00:43:46,851 --> 00:43:53,309
Speaker 0: It's just a time trial, you know, and it's basically if you can do this, you know It might as well just be a timer that counts down.

588
00:43:53,591 --> 00:43:55,540
Speaker 0: You know two minutes because the guy will all.

589
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,509
Speaker 0: the other guy will always run at the same speed.

590
00:43:58,031 --> 00:43:59,616
Speaker 0: So you will always.

591
00:43:59,836 --> 00:44:02,364
Speaker 0: you know, pretty much the game is just challenging you to beat something.

592
00:44:02,384 --> 00:44:04,410
Speaker 0: This is clearly scripted.

593
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:05,132
Speaker 1: I messed around.

594
00:44:05,213 --> 00:44:06,337
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, definitely is.

595
00:44:06,638 --> 00:44:10,290
Speaker 1: it definitely will not let you like unless you die or something.

596
00:44:10,371 --> 00:44:12,228
Speaker 1: It's not going to just screw you or anything.

597
00:44:12,931 --> 00:44:17,302
Speaker 1: but what makes it amazing is that it's so immersive like the.

598
00:44:17,522 --> 00:44:27,813
Speaker 1: the scene that I would liken it to is in Half-Life 2 when you're when you first get out of the early part of the game and you're in this apartment building and then Shit goes down

599
00:44:27,894 --> 00:44:30,041
Speaker 0: and the guys come down the stairs and whack you and

600
00:44:30,081 --> 00:44:36,808
Speaker 1: like everything just goes like and you're just like trying to Get out and you're like running through this unfamiliar place full of apartments and dead ends and it just.

601
00:44:37,189 --> 00:44:38,870
Speaker 0: well That's a being chased scene.

602
00:44:38,933 --> 00:44:39,792
Speaker 1: Yes but it's still.

603
00:44:40,193 --> 00:44:51,710
Speaker 1: it reminded me of that and that it's very difficult to immerse me in a game to the point that Something cinematic happens without it being so scripted that like I feel like I'm just on a rail.

604
00:44:51,931 --> 00:45:00,114
Speaker 1: Yep, but this and that scene in Half-Life one being chased one chasing are perfectly Balanced between.

605
00:45:00,536 --> 00:45:04,209
Speaker 1: it's really just a cinematic and yet you are playing it.

606
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:12,590
Speaker 1: yeah, definitely like to a frightening degree because Like you you don't know what to do and the game doesn't tell you what to do.

607
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:16,026
Speaker 1: But yet you just know and you just chase and it just works.

608
00:45:16,468 --> 00:45:19,950
Speaker 0: Yep I definitely get those two are great cinematic.

609
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:25,109
Speaker 0: Those are like possibly I think some of the most cinematic scenes in all FBS.

610
00:45:25,169 --> 00:45:29,601
Speaker 1: them Yes, but I gotta say also not to spoil.

611
00:45:29,641 --> 00:45:34,917
Speaker 1: but what happens at the end of this chase scene Was unexpected and delightful.

612
00:45:35,318 --> 00:45:38,347
Speaker 0: it is delightful and sort of a silly way though it is it is.

613
00:45:38,387 --> 00:45:44,829
Speaker 1: but at the same time You know Godfather reference is sort of tossed it But at the same time just playing it.

614
00:45:45,251 --> 00:45:47,097
Speaker 1: No game has done that to me before.

615
00:45:47,198 --> 00:45:58,770
Speaker 1: like games that have tried to do similar things have been so ham-fisted even professional games and No scene in all of Fallout 3 comes close to the immersion of this five-minute block-headed game.

616
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:00,977
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean the game basically does.

617
00:46:01,117 --> 00:46:09,369
Speaker 0: it does a bunch of disjointed sort of corny silly things You know that are all really stylish, but don't really have much to do with each other.

618
00:46:10,232 --> 00:46:14,646
Speaker 0: But somehow they sort of work and I just like.

619
00:46:14,666 --> 00:46:16,471
Speaker 0: I don't know what the magic is there But it's.

620
00:46:16,611 --> 00:46:17,414
Speaker 0: it's a good magic.

621
00:46:17,835 --> 00:46:25,133
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you have a computer that can play, you know quake - Everyone in the world should play.

622
00:46:25,173 --> 00:46:29,624
Speaker 0: this is free and it takes like 10 minutes and game designers take notes.

623
00:46:30,206 --> 00:46:33,637
Speaker 1: this game Accomplished more in five minutes.

624
00:46:33,837 --> 00:46:46,003
Speaker 0: open source play then like mirrors edge Supposed to be the innovative game of the year did in the guy who made this I went to his website And he's actually made a whole bunch of other stuff.

625
00:46:46,084 --> 00:46:50,687
Speaker 0: that is you know I played a couple of them and they they were also, you know, pretty good.

626
00:46:50,748 --> 00:46:54,729
Speaker 0: Not as great Not as good as gravity bone, you know, obviously he gets better with time, right?

627
00:46:55,351 --> 00:47:06,497
Speaker 0: But a lot of his old stuff is like some doom mods and quake mods and half-life mod You know made amazingly, you know as a mod making guy and he makes all sorts of stuff like this And I think that guy's going places.

628
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:09,564
Speaker 0: someone needs to hire him maybe valve maybe someone.

629
00:47:10,587 --> 00:47:11,870
Speaker 0: he's he has the skills.

630
00:47:13,851 --> 00:47:15,058
Speaker 1: Alright we screwed up.

631
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:15,864
