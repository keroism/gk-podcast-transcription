1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,215
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday December 25th.

2
00:00:11,355 --> 00:00:12,318
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,478 --> 00:00:16,770
Speaker 0: I'm rim and this is geek nights tonight the Mario tennis.

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,857
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:27,415 --> 00:00:29,133
Speaker 1: well, it's a Christmas.

6
00:00:29,735 --> 00:00:31,081
Speaker 0: well, no one's gonna be listening.

7
00:00:31,342 --> 00:00:33,310
Speaker 0: Oh, I guess we are gonna put this show up tonight, aren't we?

8
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:33,952
Speaker 1: Yeah, why not?

9
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,758
Speaker 1: Yeah, we could save this show for next week.

10
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,423
Speaker 0: I forgot you started.

11
00:00:38,407 --> 00:00:39,390
Speaker 0: I was confused for a second.

12
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,262
Speaker 0: I was like, oh the show's going not going up tonight.

13
00:00:41,322 --> 00:00:41,987
Speaker 0: Oh, yes it is.

14
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:42,490
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

15
00:00:43,192 --> 00:00:46,904
Speaker 1: Yes, it is yeah, I think what confused you is that we're trying to record ahead.

16
00:00:46,924 --> 00:00:47,827
Speaker 0: maybe maybe.

17
00:00:49,691 --> 00:00:54,250
Speaker 1: So, uh, yeah, we're gonna dispense with all that and get right to what's important in life, which is video games.

18
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:00,849
Speaker 0: video games Which I still not playing enough of correctly.

19
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:03,336
Speaker 1: You're playing plenty of video games.

20
00:01:03,356 --> 00:01:06,390
Speaker 1: you sit down in the living room playing stupid guitar hero constantly.

21
00:01:06,531 --> 00:01:11,270
Speaker 0: I know I need to go and beat that new trauma center and that Mario Galaxy and stuff, which I'm not doing.

22
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,879
Speaker 1: Well, maybe if you stop playing guitar hero, maybe.

23
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,889
Speaker 1: but maybe if you practice your real harmonica.

24
00:01:17,732 --> 00:01:19,829
Speaker 0: But the plastic guitar is so much easier.

25
00:01:21,131 --> 00:01:22,154
Speaker 1: You know the real harmonica.

26
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:27,270
Speaker 1: I can play songs on harmonica much easier than you can beat through the fire through the flames on expert.

27
00:01:27,611 --> 00:01:32,366
Speaker 0: No, I can kind of almost beat it on hard, but I can beat a whole bunch of songs on hard.

28
00:01:33,048 --> 00:01:35,796
Speaker 1: Yeah, right Alright anyway, so what do you have for me?

29
00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:36,939
Speaker 0: That's it.

30
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:37,801
Speaker 0: That's our opening bit.

31
00:01:37,841 --> 00:01:38,443
Speaker 0: That was wonderful.

32
00:01:38,784 --> 00:01:39,967
Speaker 1: Well, we do have the dune game.

33
00:01:39,987 --> 00:01:42,415
Speaker 1: Oh Finally got a hold of that.

34
00:01:43,018 --> 00:01:46,150
Speaker 0: Yeah kind of did a little eBay auction got it for 40-something bucks.

35
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,274
Speaker 0: We didn't talk about this last week.

36
00:01:47,595 --> 00:01:49,020
Speaker 1: I don't think we did not in any detail.

37
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,165
Speaker 1: We've played the dune game.

38
00:01:50,225 --> 00:01:50,646
Speaker 1: Finally.

39
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:51,509
Speaker 0: Yeah it.

40
00:01:52,811 --> 00:01:56,310
Speaker 0: Well, I think it might be a good game, but I think it's not a very good two-player game.

41
00:01:56,792 --> 00:01:58,820
Speaker 1: It's definitely not a good two-player game.

42
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,170
Speaker 0: I mean it says you can play a two-player but it's lying.

43
00:02:01,612 --> 00:02:04,363
Speaker 1: Well, you see what happened was Scott and I were gonna play the dune game.

44
00:02:04,443 --> 00:02:10,229
Speaker 0: So, uh, ah Scott picks the old ladies and I and I chose them at random by the way.

45
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:13,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then you are deliberately chose the old ladies the second time.

46
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,393
Speaker 0: Well, I said I wanted.

47
00:02:14,413 --> 00:02:22,589
Speaker 0: I thought that you know since I was already familiar with the rules of the old ladies that I could You know play better on the second go after learning how to play from the first go.

48
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:25,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the Harkonnen can't lose in two-player.

49
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,067
Speaker 0: I don't know.

50
00:02:26,531 --> 00:02:27,654
Speaker 0: We should test it out and see.

51
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:40,785
Speaker 0: but they're pretty strong right away because they get fistful of cards for almost nothing and they have a fistful is spice right away and I have to like if I'm the old ladies I have to fight to get spice and fight to get cards and I realize

52
00:02:40,826 --> 00:02:41,850
Speaker 1: for your right to spice

53
00:02:42,093 --> 00:02:43,109
Speaker 0: It's really difficult.

54
00:02:43,432 --> 00:02:53,830
Speaker 1: I think what seals this game for me is that what so Encapsulates the dune universe is that you have this board and it shows this planet whatever and there are only two piles of cards.

55
00:02:54,152 --> 00:02:56,890
Speaker 1: You have spice and you have treachery.

56
00:02:58,535 --> 00:03:00,176
Speaker 0: Yep Right.

57
00:03:00,217 --> 00:03:01,229
Speaker 1: So what do you got in the news?

58
00:03:01,792 --> 00:03:04,285
Speaker 1: Okay, not a better opening bit you have here with that.

59
00:03:04,305 --> 00:03:04,989
Speaker 0: no, okay.

60
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:10,245
Speaker 0: Anyway, you know impossible mission not mission impossible, but impossible mission, you know that game.

61
00:03:10,746 --> 00:03:12,090
Speaker 1: I recall that game vaguely.

62
00:03:12,211 --> 00:03:13,097
Speaker 1: I never really liked it.

63
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,064
Speaker 0: Ah, it's.

64
00:03:14,144 --> 00:03:18,803
Speaker 1: it's one of those Classic amazing games that no one actually likes but everyone talks about.

65
00:03:18,843 --> 00:03:20,228
Speaker 0: no, no one actually likes this game.

66
00:03:20,248 --> 00:03:20,509
Speaker 0: Okay?

67
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:42,580
Speaker 0: it's incredibly impossible and difficult platforming game where there's like endless similar looking hallways and doors and Elevators and all sorts of shit like that and the game is called impossible mission for a reason because the game is basically impossible and I didn't realize this but it was originally on the Commodore 64, but the version I know was on the NES and Some people remember this game fondly.

68
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,490
Speaker 0: but it's one of those sort of like he-man things.

69
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:49,366
Speaker 0: Yeah, if he actually went back to play he'd realize that your dad was just childhood memories and not reality.

70
00:03:49,386 --> 00:03:58,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway Somebody's remaking this game I think for DS and we and I think the DS version might already be out.

71
00:03:59,012 --> 00:04:05,959
Speaker 0: But I think well, actually I'm sure that whether when it is out if it even if it's out now It's a GameStop exclusive.

72
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,229
Speaker 0: so you can only get this game a GameStop and nowhere else.

73
00:04:09,053 --> 00:04:12,530
Speaker 0: I think that sort of ass like someone's making a game and only selling it at one store.

74
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,756
Speaker 1: I don't want to go to GameStop.

75
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:16,649
Speaker 1: I like GameStop less and less as time goes on.

76
00:04:16,951 --> 00:04:19,445
Speaker 0: I know where were the Amazon exclusive video games.

77
00:04:19,486 --> 00:04:20,149
Speaker 0: help me out here.

78
00:04:21,591 --> 00:04:23,237
Speaker 0: But yeah, I think that's pretty interesting.

79
00:04:23,278 --> 00:04:25,506
Speaker 0: Someone's doing retailer exclusive video games.

80
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:25,747
Speaker 0: Now.

81
00:04:25,827 --> 00:04:26,670
Speaker 0: It's kind of like, huh?

82
00:04:28,111 --> 00:04:29,617
Speaker 0: Why do you even make it in the first place?

83
00:04:29,698 --> 00:04:31,244
Speaker 0: Like how you get a profit off?

84
00:04:31,325 --> 00:04:32,570
Speaker 0: I mean they selling it for 10 bucks.

85
00:04:33,392 --> 00:04:35,748
Speaker 0: Maybe it was just a really cheap game to make I don't know.

86
00:04:36,231 --> 00:04:39,830
Speaker 1: Maybe they figured they'd get some hype from the fact that it's only being sold at GameStop.

87
00:04:39,991 --> 00:04:42,860
Speaker 1: I'm sure GameStop is trying to bundle it with all sorts of things.

88
00:04:43,382 --> 00:04:45,670
Speaker 1: Maybe but hey check this out only 10 bucks.

89
00:04:45,731 --> 00:04:46,740
Speaker 1: Hey only 10 bucks.

90
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,849
Speaker 1: check this out 10 bucks.

91
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:59,710
Speaker 0: But like who seriously is gonna go to GameStop just for this game, you know I mean that's the reason you have an exclusive thing Right, like you have an exclusive game on the Xbox 360 because you want people to buy a 360 just for the game.

92
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:04,770
Speaker 0: You have an exclusive game in your store because you want people to come to your store just for that game.

93
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:07,849
Speaker 0: Who's coming to GameStop just for Impossible Mission DS?

94
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:16,295
Speaker 1: Admittedly the only time I ever the only thing I ever look at in GameStops nowadays is use games because I'm just gonna buy new games On eBay or on Amazon.

95
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:17,539
Speaker 0: Yeah selling game.

96
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,910
Speaker 0: You know GameStop is pretty much only useful for buying used stuff.

97
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:27,542
Speaker 0: It's not useful for selling you stuff because you get a better deal on eBay, but buying you stuff It's you know more convenient than eBay, I guess.

98
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:32,510
Speaker 0: but yeah GameStop, I mean what else that's gonna get me to come to your store?

99
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:37,310
Speaker 0: You need like an exclusive like Mario Galaxy GameStop only then maybe I'd come to GameStop.

100
00:05:37,411 --> 00:05:44,180
Speaker 1: I mean I'd say oh But you should go to a GameStop or something when a console comes out to get it early But you can buy a console at Best Buy.

101
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,430
Speaker 0: You can buy a console on Amazon and just wait.

102
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:55,389
Speaker 1: I still remember when I was in Times Square and I tried to go buy some DS lights and I saw the pile of Wiis and the people physically fighting over them.

103
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:57,377
Speaker 1: and Just is there a Wii?

104
00:05:57,438 --> 00:05:59,330
Speaker 1: No, and they're totally sold out of DS's and everything.

105
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:05,510
Speaker 1: And then I go to a Radio Shack not that far away from there and there's Wiis and DS lights.

106
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:14,950
Speaker 1: Yep So in other news I stumbled upon this when I was looking for news to talk about because I haven't really gone to Kotaku in a while.

107
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,120
Speaker 1: I just haven't had time to poke around the internet.

108
00:06:17,261 --> 00:06:19,189
Speaker 0: that he's the Google Reader like everybody.

109
00:06:20,453 --> 00:06:22,669
Speaker 1: Even then I don't subscribe because I don't care enough.

110
00:06:23,492 --> 00:06:27,806
Speaker 1: Very little of what token Kotaku tells me is anything I would care about unless that's true.

111
00:06:28,047 --> 00:06:28,930
Speaker 0: I just don't read.

112
00:06:29,052 --> 00:06:29,930
Speaker 0: Let's see how much let's see.

113
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,930
Speaker 0: Let's let me check my Google Reader and it will tell me how much of Kotaku I actually read.

114
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:44,830
Speaker 1: The only time I read Kotaku or any site like that is one if I'm looking for something to talk about on geek nights or Two if I'm bored and seeking entertainment on the internet, and I am right.

115
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:48,201
Speaker 1: I have not been bored enough to seek entertainment on the internet in a while.

116
00:06:48,843 --> 00:06:50,648
Speaker 0: So in forever, right?

117
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,805
Speaker 0: I've read a hundred and forty stories on Kotaku through my Google Reader.

118
00:06:54,945 --> 00:06:56,211
Speaker 0: That's 11%.

119
00:06:56,211 --> 00:07:00,123
Speaker 0: So only 11% of Kotaku stories are actually read by me.

120
00:07:00,183 --> 00:07:01,186
Speaker 0: The other 89% are ignored.

121
00:07:03,377 --> 00:07:05,352
Speaker 0: Way to go go talking Right.

122
00:07:05,432 --> 00:07:07,439
Speaker 1: Well, they've kind of have a semi.

123
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:09,868
Speaker 1: They're really the best source for that kind of news.

124
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:16,130
Speaker 1: Yep Yeah, but there's this game coming out on the PSP called pat upon.

125
00:07:16,772 --> 00:07:21,790
Speaker 1: That's upon and pat upon looks kind of I feel like more and more.

126
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:24,266
Speaker 1: I'm eventually going to be forced to buy a PSP.

127
00:07:24,366 --> 00:07:31,763
Speaker 1: What I Mean if I'll when I can pay 80 bucks for a PSP I'm probably gonna buy a PS by the time.

128
00:07:31,803 --> 00:07:34,415
Speaker 0: then PSPs will be done for That's fine.

129
00:07:34,577 --> 00:07:36,109
Speaker 0: You can emulate PSP games.

130
00:07:36,491 --> 00:07:38,880
Speaker 1: I think the point is that I want to play him on the go.

131
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:41,410
Speaker 1: I could podcast with it still I guess I guess.

132
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,277
Speaker 0: But you could podcast better with other things.

133
00:07:43,378 --> 00:07:44,060
Speaker 1: what my iPod?

134
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:45,044
Speaker 1: that doesn't have Wi-Fi.

135
00:07:45,105 --> 00:07:46,835
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know right my cell phone They can't do.

136
00:07:46,876 --> 00:07:47,929
Speaker 0: problem is it's too big.

137
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,040
Speaker 0: So it's like carry on this giant thing in your pocket.

138
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,924
Speaker 0: try to listen mp3s.

139
00:07:50,964 --> 00:07:52,110
Speaker 1: I get the PSP slim.

140
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,193
Speaker 0: It's still.

141
00:07:53,253 --> 00:07:54,097
Speaker 0: it's still giant.

142
00:07:54,217 --> 00:07:56,287
Speaker 0: It's not anything less wide.

143
00:07:56,347 --> 00:07:56,970
Speaker 1: It's just game.

144
00:07:57,992 --> 00:08:02,041
Speaker 1: It's almost the same for what I can tell to that old SNES King Arthur game.

145
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:03,530
Speaker 1: or yet it's kind of like lemmings.

146
00:08:03,611 --> 00:08:10,189
Speaker 1: but instead of Helpless stupid lemmings you have Knights and wizards and you tell them to march right and they fight with things and do stuff.

147
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:14,250
Speaker 1: but To control the game instead of telling things what to do.

148
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:19,307
Speaker 1: it looks like you just have to play the right rhythm and it's a rhythm game.

149
00:08:19,688 --> 00:08:23,442
Speaker 1: and Dang in how rhythmic you are your soldiers will do different things.

150
00:08:23,924 --> 00:08:25,550
Speaker 0: That sounds pretty good to me.

151
00:08:25,811 --> 00:08:40,119
Speaker 0: I mean, I looked at the screenshots of this game and I watched a little video and it seems like You know Sony in general is really ever since Katamari is really going after these games with the sort of cute Graphic design and interesting gameplay like they got

152
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:40,460
Speaker 1: just then.

153
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,065
Speaker 0: remember they got that flow game.

154
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,530
Speaker 1: remember way before Viv Riven.

155
00:08:43,913 --> 00:08:44,981
Speaker 0: Yep, they got the Viv Riven.

156
00:08:45,001 --> 00:08:46,130
Speaker 0: They got the loco roko.

157
00:08:46,411 --> 00:08:48,639
Speaker 0: They got all those kind of games.

158
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:56,670
Speaker 0: Sony is really sort of fighting and doing everything They can to keep those games on their system and really those are the only games they have that I'm interested in.

159
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:01,590
Speaker 0: But I'm kind of interested in them but not interested enough to actually buy any a Sony console.

160
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:08,117
Speaker 1: What this does show at least is that the PSP is a viable second place Which we've talked about how crazy that is before.

161
00:09:08,197 --> 00:09:17,027
Speaker 1: but if you don't buy a PSP to play this game But if you already have a PSP, you would better be playing this game once you can get it.

162
00:09:17,188 --> 00:09:23,697
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much I mean, you know other rhythm games out there like the DDR And the guitar heroes.

163
00:09:23,717 --> 00:09:25,645
Speaker 0: they're just sort of rhythm for the sake of rhythm.

164
00:09:25,785 --> 00:09:27,954
Speaker 0: Well games like this I separate.

165
00:09:27,974 --> 00:09:28,134
Speaker 1: I mean.

166
00:09:28,155 --> 00:09:32,050
Speaker 1: the thing is this game is still all it is and we've talked about this before.

167
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:39,670
Speaker 1: What if you made a fighting game where you just do DDR and depending on how well you dance It just animates the whole fight and this game could be something like that?

168
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:46,189
Speaker 0: I think this is more like not how well you dance but you do different Dances to get the guy to do different moves.

169
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:51,090
Speaker 1: The only thing that worries me is that the dances are basically limited to hitting buttons on your PSP.

170
00:09:51,432 --> 00:09:56,396
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much this game would have been better if it came with some sort of bongo Maybe some sort of plastic.

171
00:09:56,436 --> 00:09:57,822
Speaker 0: Well, you could get you could play.

172
00:09:57,862 --> 00:10:00,663
Speaker 0: something like DK's was a jungle beat I think was the one.

173
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,468
Speaker 0: yeah Yeah We use the bongos to control Donkey Kong.

174
00:10:04,132 --> 00:10:09,030
Speaker 1: And it came with a spear that you put the Wii mode in and you had to shake the spear around and bang it on.

175
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:12,610
Speaker 1: Things no be all right, maybe bang the spear and shield together.

176
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,456
Speaker 1: It's very I don't know.

177
00:10:14,476 --> 00:10:19,553
Speaker 1: the game is very stylish in that kind of way that these sorts of games always are and I got To admit the kind of

178
00:10:20,015 --> 00:10:26,976
Speaker 0: I could just see it now a bunch of people playing multiplayer for people with shields and Spears banging them on each other like that shark

179
00:10:27,036 --> 00:10:27,738
Speaker 1: Azula

180
00:10:27,858 --> 00:10:33,460
Speaker 0: like it's some sort of Cave people like ook ook ook and it makes the people on the screen do things.

181
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:51,200
Speaker 1: I Think the much more important issue with having a bunch of Spears and shields is that kids gonna lose an eye pretty much immediately pretty much After that expensive vase gets knocked over.

182
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:57,197
Speaker 1: look smash vase doo doo be caveman be.

183
00:10:58,522 --> 00:11:00,830
Speaker 0: How do we get from Pat upon PSP to caveman?

184
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:03,320
Speaker 1: one thing I can say though that for a rhythm game.

185
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,290
Speaker 1: It's got some very uh catchy rhythms going.

186
00:11:06,692 --> 00:11:09,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was definitely rocking to those rhythms for sure.

187
00:11:09,342 --> 00:11:11,274
Speaker 0: I would love to get like a little soundtrack or something.

188
00:11:11,536 --> 00:11:12,626
Speaker 0: That'd be fun time I don't know.

189
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:16,736
Speaker 1: I feel like it's kind of music I could play in the background while I'm playing some other game to keep me concentrating.

190
00:11:16,756 --> 00:11:33,354
Speaker 1: Yeah so things of the day be Mmm, dude My thing of day be I'd fuck that fuck it.

191
00:11:33,937 --> 00:11:38,154
Speaker 1: So, uh Griefing is a time-honored tradition in first-person.

192
00:11:38,174 --> 00:11:39,580
Speaker 0: She we talked about griefing before.

193
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:47,868
Speaker 1: if we haven't I think we're gonna do a show on it because griefing is really really horrible and stupid and it's this immature thing that a lot of people do.

194
00:11:47,888 --> 00:11:58,493
Speaker 1: but at the same time if You can I guess transcend it and not be annoyed by it Like if it happens and you don't freak out about it and you can take it on this intellectual level.

195
00:11:58,513 --> 00:12:00,600
Speaker 1: It is also hilarious.

196
00:12:01,702 --> 00:12:10,917
Speaker 0: It can be hilarious in the right situations, you know, like a guy Killing someone then killing them when they respond then killing them immediately when they respond.

197
00:12:10,937 --> 00:12:11,960
Speaker 0: That's not really funny.

198
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:12,780
Speaker 0: It can be funny.

199
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:18,799
Speaker 0: It can be funny if you've never seen it before or if you the idea of spawn camping itself was new to you Then it would be funny.

200
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:24,000
Speaker 0: Well like oh that's possible lol, but once you understand the idea of spawn camping is no longer funny.

201
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:34,697
Speaker 1: See I understood the idea of spawn camping But there was that one time when the cyberdemon was spawn camping me and Ken while we were trying to be tomb - okay I guess in a particular crazy situation like that.

202
00:12:34,757 --> 00:12:42,160
Speaker 0: It could be funny like oh You know foreseen spawn camp situation lol, but you need to be a clever griefer.

203
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:49,868
Speaker 1: For example, I was playing a game of counter-strike once back when speed hacking was easy to do and rampant Especially if you had Windows 2000.

204
00:12:49,868 --> 00:12:55,656
Speaker 1: Yep, so We're on the server and someone keeps accusing this one guy of cheating.

205
00:12:55,676 --> 00:12:58,687
Speaker 1: He's like fucking cheater Yeah, and he's just yelling and this guy's cheating.

206
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:02,139
Speaker 1: So finally the guy's like I'm not cheating god damn it.

207
00:13:02,722 --> 00:13:03,344
Speaker 1: Yes, you are.

208
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:15,980
Speaker 1: so the next round the guy appears in our spawn immediately as the round begins and Stabs us all to death before we can move and he says now I'm cheating fucker.

209
00:13:21,502 --> 00:13:26,020
Speaker 1: But I know I always found speed hacks funny even even if they were really just annoying and griefing.

210
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,683
Speaker 0: I think they're.

211
00:13:26,724 --> 00:13:31,805
Speaker 0: I think they're funny just because the way it looked when someone was speed hacking I'd be walking real slow.

212
00:13:32,086 --> 00:13:32,949
Speaker 1: I stop at a corner.

213
00:13:32,969 --> 00:13:33,993
Speaker 1: I yell.

214
00:13:34,093 --> 00:13:35,880
Speaker 1: All right guys come in I come around the corner.

215
00:13:39,642 --> 00:13:49,933
Speaker 0: Yeah It was that it was definitely the animation of the speed hack and the way it looked on the screen was funny Not the actual act of griefing with the speed hack itself.

216
00:13:50,555 --> 00:13:52,020
Speaker 1: Now this video my thing of the day.

217
00:13:52,362 --> 00:13:59,700
Speaker 1: there's a chance it was completely staged, but I give it a 60% chance maybe even a 70% chance of being fully legitimate.

218
00:14:00,021 --> 00:14:11,738
Speaker 1: Yep, it looks like they got a couple of people on two different teams on the same server to collaborate for epic cross team griefing.

219
00:14:12,415 --> 00:14:20,679
Speaker 0: Okay so basically the first thing they do is they set up some teleporters right and they set up the teleporter exit and then they Says they have buddies on the other team.

220
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:22,305
Speaker 0: They set up turrets.

221
00:14:22,847 --> 00:14:26,380
Speaker 0: aiming is a steam fortress - by the way at the teleporter exits.

222
00:14:26,761 --> 00:14:34,193
Speaker 0: so, of course if you're on a team you spot you spawn you go outside the teleporter there you go in it a turret immediately kills you and

223
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:46,600
Speaker 1: Eventually, I think my favorite moment in that is when this one guy's like guys Don't use the teleporter with the guy with all the stupid name with all the squares in it And then that guy's like up why it goes right to the enemy base.

224
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:56,105
Speaker 1: Yeah, they got sentries on it and then the guy the engineer the cheating collaborating engineer while stifling laughter says no Those turrets are gone man.

225
00:14:56,587 --> 00:14:57,069
Speaker 1: Just go.

226
00:14:57,089 --> 00:15:00,299
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's like if the turrets are there they would destroy the teleporter.

227
00:15:01,742 --> 00:15:02,546
Speaker 0: It wouldn't be there.

228
00:15:02,566 --> 00:15:03,691
Speaker 0: Just go go.

229
00:15:03,711 --> 00:15:05,760
Speaker 0: the teleporter guy tells him the teleport dies.

230
00:15:07,402 --> 00:15:09,152
Speaker 1: And that's only the beginning.

231
00:15:09,273 --> 00:15:12,767
Speaker 1: and the the epic Lols that follow are quite worth while.

232
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:19,837
Speaker 0: the funniest part is they use this house with the scouts to lock everyone in the spawn Room, right and then they sort of refuse to let they could.

233
00:15:19,857 --> 00:15:23,859
Speaker 0: just you know If that happens, you can just sort of change classes and then everyone can get out.

234
00:15:24,663 --> 00:15:27,195
Speaker 0: They refuse to do that and they basically say alright everyone.

235
00:15:27,215 --> 00:15:28,300
Speaker 0: We're gonna do a little game show.

236
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,831
Speaker 0: You have to answer our quiz questions and we'll let you out.

237
00:15:30,951 --> 00:15:33,000
Speaker 1: What organ of the body produces bile?

238
00:15:33,401 --> 00:15:35,306
Speaker 0: Yeah, you guys like gallbladder.

239
00:15:35,326 --> 00:15:40,500
Speaker 0: guys like no not the gallbladders liver, which is wrong, but it's pretty fun.

240
00:15:41,162 --> 00:15:48,779
Speaker 1: Actually the I think the best part of that is the one scout who's doing it instead of immediately saying alright I'm fucking with you guys time for a quiz show.

241
00:15:49,525 --> 00:15:51,015
Speaker 1: He acts serious man.

242
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:56,300
Speaker 1: I'm stuck I don't know what to do and this one guy who doesn't get it is like just kill yourself.

243
00:15:56,862 --> 00:15:59,833
Speaker 1: But but I don't want to mess up my stance and the guy loses it.

244
00:16:00,195 --> 00:16:01,379
Speaker 1: Yeah guy just loses it.

245
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:11,412
Speaker 0: It's funny how these people like took it so seriously like you moron just just freaking you know on spawn But at the same time this one thing you just leave.

246
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:15,166
Speaker 0: if so if I'm gonna server and someone's pulling shit like that I just leave the server.

247
00:16:15,427 --> 00:16:16,994
Speaker 0: It's funny how no one leaves the server.

248
00:16:17,014 --> 00:16:18,359
Speaker 0: They just keep fighting the griefers.

249
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:26,600
Speaker 1: well at the same time if you're in the middle of a good game and it's It's almost fun when a clever griefer is there it's whenever anything weird happens in a moment.

250
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,215
Speaker 0: This guy is clearly not having fun with the griefer.

251
00:16:29,235 --> 00:16:30,100
Speaker 0: He's clearly upset.

252
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,540
Speaker 0: I mean I would say if I was having fun with the griefer, but if I wasn't I would leave this guy.

253
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,074
Speaker 0: It's clearly not having fun yet.

254
00:16:36,114 --> 00:16:41,259
Speaker 1: He's saying We just It's just it's funny and it's worth watching.

255
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:44,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's been around the net for like a day or so.

256
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,112
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.

257
00:16:45,132 --> 00:16:45,895
Speaker 1: Well, we're not news.

258
00:16:45,935 --> 00:16:46,819
Speaker 1: We're commentary.

259
00:16:46,859 --> 00:16:49,629
Speaker 0: Yeah Alright, so check this video out.

260
00:16:50,352 --> 00:16:52,240
Speaker 0: It's called Mario Troyd.

261
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:58,160
Speaker 0: Basically, it looks to me like it's hard to tell exactly what the story is with this thing, but it's pretty obvious.

262
00:16:58,301 --> 00:17:00,029
Speaker 1: Oh, I thought you were gonna do the blades of steel thing.

263
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:01,517
Speaker 1: You'll have to save that or save that.

264
00:17:01,557 --> 00:17:06,800
Speaker 0: Yeah The guy took Mario and he took Metroid and you sort of combined him.

265
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:13,303
Speaker 0: It's it's definitely a Mario game or you're controlling Mario, but he can double jump like Samus but he jumps.

266
00:17:13,384 --> 00:17:21,020
Speaker 0: the way Mario jumps, but he sort of has a double jump and then He can also has like permanent firepower and he might be invincible.

267
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:21,944
Speaker 0: I can't really tell.

268
00:17:21,964 --> 00:17:25,960
Speaker 0: it's hard to tell from the video if he's invincible or not or how much life he is.

269
00:17:26,221 --> 00:17:27,486
Speaker 1: I don't think it matters at all.

270
00:17:27,526 --> 00:17:28,430
Speaker 1: This doesn't matter.

271
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,454
Speaker 1: you would actually play.

272
00:17:29,474 --> 00:17:34,160
Speaker 1: he basically made this hack Just to create a cool video to look at on the internet.

273
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:40,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it basically it's Mario but like in a Metroid world and all sorts of crazy stuff happens.

274
00:17:41,441 --> 00:17:45,135
Speaker 0: I mean, it's a really good mashup of Mario and Metroid ROM hack kind of deal.

275
00:17:45,235 --> 00:17:50,000
Speaker 0: It is impressive looking It's very impressive and then at the end, there's an awesome boss thing.

276
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,198
Speaker 0: I mean, it's a little long like you'll get bored of it after you watch it for a minute or two.

277
00:17:53,660 --> 00:18:03,260
Speaker 0: So then just skip to where the boss is and you see the Metroids and stuff and it is the boss is Baby Metroids yellow baby Metroids and then you skip and the awesomeness at the end and then that's it.

278
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:14,850
Speaker 0: but this is worth five minutes of your time if you like Mario's or Metroids or combinations thereof right, so I don't think we've actually ever talked about this.

279
00:18:15,151 --> 00:18:23,620
Speaker 1: I guess franchise this series of games, but Mario tennis has a long and illustrious history in the front row crew.

280
00:18:24,082 --> 00:18:25,509
Speaker 0: Well, most people don't realize this.

281
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:27,640
Speaker 0: the very first Mario tennis game.

282
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,387
Speaker 0: Do you know what it was for?

283
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:28,427
Speaker 0: I?

284
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,889
Speaker 1: Believe it was for the virtual boy.

285
00:18:31,949 --> 00:18:34,200
Speaker 0: Oh, it was indeed for the virtual boy.

286
00:18:34,401 --> 00:18:38,600
Speaker 0: It was a quote 3d game with only two colors of red and black.

287
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:43,701
Speaker 1: And if any of you have ever played a virtual boy, I got to say well if you haven't I guess It's.

288
00:18:43,942 --> 00:18:45,870
Speaker 0: I imagine most listeners have not played.

289
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:46,573
Speaker 0: I have.

290
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:47,557
Speaker 1: I have also.

291
00:18:47,577 --> 00:18:51,140
Speaker 0: I in fact I played Mario tennis in a Toys R Us on a virtual boy.

292
00:18:51,441 --> 00:18:53,733
Speaker 1: I played every game for the virtual boy.

293
00:18:53,914 --> 00:18:55,080
Speaker 1: Wow every single one.

294
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:55,865
Speaker 1: How'd you do that?

295
00:18:56,046 --> 00:19:01,736
Speaker 1: because they had him all for play admire Okay, and a friend of mine to this day owns his virtual boy.

296
00:19:01,756 --> 00:19:04,046
Speaker 0: Yep I have a friend who also.

297
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:09,899
Speaker 1: he got it for Christmas right after it came out played it for like a week Got a headache every time he played it never played it again.

298
00:19:10,623 --> 00:19:14,980
Speaker 1: Well one thing I can say the 3d effect was actually pretty damn impressive.

299
00:19:15,201 --> 00:19:16,569
Speaker 0: It was it actually looked.

300
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:20,106
Speaker 0: when you're playing Mario tennis on the virtual boy it actually looked like you were very.

301
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:27,015
Speaker 0: Mario is very close to you and the other guy was very far away from you and it Was sort of a ball level view of the game.

302
00:19:27,035 --> 00:19:27,336
Speaker 0: and it was.

303
00:19:27,397 --> 00:19:31,169
Speaker 1: it was good stuff Yeah, and not the bad ball level the good ball level right.

304
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,520
Speaker 0: then again that Mario tennis was not exactly a great game.

305
00:19:34,721 --> 00:19:35,590
Speaker 1: Well, it could have been.

306
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:36,560
Speaker 1: it was a pretty good game.

307
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,725
Speaker 0: The problem was a game.

308
00:19:38,046 --> 00:19:41,380
Speaker 1: the virtual boy was an abortion to put it lightly.

309
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,969
Speaker 1: Lightly, well, I will talk about the virtual boy someday.

310
00:19:45,109 --> 00:19:52,339
Speaker 1: and what exactly what the deal was there, but yeah Virtual boy, it's an important part of Nintendo history.

311
00:19:52,801 --> 00:19:58,354
Speaker 0: Regardless there was also the original tennis for the NES which is a terrible game terrible.

312
00:19:58,414 --> 00:19:59,316
Speaker 0: Absolutely unplayable.

313
00:19:59,336 --> 00:20:02,967
Speaker 0: Don't even bother with it For the Super Nintendo.

314
00:20:03,308 --> 00:20:05,057
Speaker 0: not really so much tennis going on.

315
00:20:05,097 --> 00:20:05,600
Speaker 0: Are you kidding?

316
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,879
Speaker 1: I forget what it was called, but there was one really awesome tennis game.

317
00:20:09,181 --> 00:20:10,367
Speaker 1: Well, I I didn't know.

318
00:20:10,387 --> 00:20:11,854
Speaker 1: I think it had a like.

319
00:20:11,914 --> 00:20:13,120
Speaker 1: it was an Andre Agassi or something.

320
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:13,884
Speaker 1: I'll have to look it up.

321
00:20:13,925 --> 00:20:19,267
Speaker 1: But all I remember is when I was a kid Children's Palace went out of business.

322
00:20:19,588 --> 00:20:21,034
Speaker 1: They were like it used to be.

323
00:20:21,074 --> 00:20:25,789
Speaker 1: there were two toy stores in America Yep, Toys R Us and Children's Palace.

324
00:20:25,829 --> 00:20:28,255
Speaker 1: Yep, and Children's Palace went under.

325
00:20:28,336 --> 00:20:29,900
Speaker 0: so they showed houses a crap hole.

326
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,766
Speaker 1: Children's Palace was nice.

327
00:20:31,906 --> 00:20:33,695
Speaker 0: Actually ours was a shithole.

328
00:20:33,876 --> 00:20:34,600
Speaker 1: Ours was really nice.

329
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,849
Speaker 0: I remember when they were going out of business and we went there.

330
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:39,640
Speaker 0: there was just toys just all over the floor everywhere.

331
00:20:39,741 --> 00:20:40,206
Speaker 0: Who is the man?

332
00:20:40,267 --> 00:20:41,500
Speaker 1: Well, that's because it was going out of business.

333
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,087
Speaker 0: I'm just saying before then though.

334
00:20:43,147 --> 00:20:44,011
Speaker 0: It was still kind.

335
00:20:44,071 --> 00:20:46,260
Speaker 0: it wasn't much messier when it was going out of business.

336
00:20:47,188 --> 00:21:04,232
Speaker 1: When it was going out of business I my family and I it hit the point where finally there was an ad on TV one day that said next week Children's Palace for the last week of its existence 70% off Everything in the store video

337
00:21:04,253 --> 00:21:05,759
Speaker 0: games video games video games.

338
00:21:06,161 --> 00:21:13,244
Speaker 1: So, of course, I was there with my family in that that that that that chaos It was.

339
00:21:13,768 --> 00:21:15,399
Speaker 1: it was amazing that no one died.

340
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:21,878
Speaker 1: yeah, it was just yelling and screaming and people knocking over shelves and rooting through things that had fallen off.

341
00:21:21,918 --> 00:21:26,800
Speaker 1: and but We bought like a thousand dollars worth of toys.

342
00:21:27,563 --> 00:21:27,724
Speaker 0: Good.

343
00:21:27,764 --> 00:21:28,186
Speaker 0: Yeah.

344
00:21:28,649 --> 00:21:30,699
Speaker 1: Well a thousand dollars before the discount.

345
00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:40,090
Speaker 1: So but at one point I remember we went to the Nintendo section first as did every kid who was smart and there was nothing there.

346
00:21:41,755 --> 00:21:45,415
Speaker 1: Now everyone else went oh And I said, wait a minute.

347
00:21:46,158 --> 00:21:49,890
Speaker 1: I was here when the store opened and I didn't see anyone checking out.

348
00:21:50,653 --> 00:21:53,770
Speaker 1: There is no way that someone got here before me.

349
00:21:53,891 --> 00:22:02,409
Speaker 1: They are somewhere in this store and sure enough There was a hidden part of the store where all the Nintendo and Super Nintendo games they had left were.

350
00:22:03,252 --> 00:22:05,560
Speaker 1: We bought one of every unique game.

351
00:22:06,122 --> 00:22:07,306
Speaker 1: That's where I got populace.

352
00:22:07,346 --> 00:22:08,510
Speaker 1: I got this tennis game.

353
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:14,090
Speaker 1: I got some city and I got God I got a pile of games shitty games something good.

354
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,957
Speaker 1: This was a pretty damn good game.

355
00:22:15,977 --> 00:22:16,881
Speaker 0: They're big come populist.

356
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:17,564
Speaker 0: DS is coming.

357
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,700
Speaker 1: I Think I knew that but I'd forgotten.

358
00:22:21,023 --> 00:22:21,244
Speaker 1: Yeah.

359
00:22:21,526 --> 00:22:26,802
Speaker 0: Oh, man anyway anyway So Super Nintendo there was.

360
00:22:26,943 --> 00:22:27,950
Speaker 0: I guess there were tennis games.

361
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:31,482
Speaker 0: I never played any of them and none of them were I guess epically famous or anything.

362
00:22:32,165 --> 00:22:33,048
Speaker 0: and it wasn't until the n64.

363
00:22:34,551 --> 00:22:39,647
Speaker 0: They came out with Mario tennis for the n64, there's also some Gameboy color and advanced versions.

364
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:40,430
Speaker 0: we don't care about those.

365
00:22:41,691 --> 00:22:43,738
Speaker 0: But yet Mario tennis at the n64 was quite the game.

366
00:22:43,758 --> 00:22:49,140
Speaker 1: I Mean that game along with Smash Brothers.

367
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,089
Speaker 1: I think I started a whole new.

368
00:22:51,811 --> 00:22:54,680
Speaker 1: I'd almost call it a genre of sports games.

369
00:22:55,102 --> 00:22:56,044
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's sort of like.

370
00:22:56,305 --> 00:22:59,537
Speaker 0: it was like a party game yet It was also a sports game yet.

371
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:00,542
Speaker 0: It was a Mario game.

372
00:23:00,883 --> 00:23:02,390
Speaker 1: Yep, cuz Smash Brothers has the same thing.

373
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:11,790
Speaker 1: It was a party game, but it was a fighting game, but it was a Mario game Yep, and it basically the game had a full loadout of characters of all different kinds.

374
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:14,740
Speaker 0: You know some were fast some were slow some hit hard.

375
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,904
Speaker 0: some hit not so hard.

376
00:23:16,265 --> 00:23:16,947
Speaker 0: some were big.

377
00:23:17,007 --> 00:23:17,790
Speaker 0: some were small.

378
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:20,116
Speaker 0: Some could do tricky stuff.

379
00:23:20,156 --> 00:23:21,500
Speaker 0: some couldn't do tricky stuff.

380
00:23:21,841 --> 00:23:24,930
Speaker 0: some controlled really nicely some controlled really slippery.

381
00:23:25,893 --> 00:23:28,843
Speaker 0: It was you know, very well balanced across all the characters.

382
00:23:29,225 --> 00:23:30,670
Speaker 0: you could play in your own style.

383
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:34,030
Speaker 0: It was actually a lot more complex than just hit the ball back and forth.

384
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:43,174
Speaker 0: you can hit the ball different ways with different shots and it was actually a strategy to it and doubles play worked really well and Just everything about.

385
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:44,197
Speaker 0: it was terrific.

386
00:23:44,237 --> 00:23:48,750
Speaker 0: I mean it was basically it mean it's a tennis game, but really it's the evolution of Pong.

387
00:23:48,911 --> 00:23:50,610
Speaker 0: I mean Pong was supposed to be table tennis.

388
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,934
Speaker 0: this is basically Pong except you also had to.

389
00:23:54,014 --> 00:24:00,480
Speaker 0: you can move closer and farther away from the center line, which is the net and You have to actually push a button to hit the ball.

390
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,524
Speaker 0: Otherwise it goes past you.

391
00:24:01,946 --> 00:24:04,577
Speaker 1: this game was like one of the best party games ever.

392
00:24:04,617 --> 00:24:05,541
Speaker 1: when it came out It was.

393
00:24:06,003 --> 00:24:16,320
Speaker 1: I never even owned an N64, but I knew about this game and we were at RIT actually Long into the GameCube era pretty much right up until the GameCube Mario Tennis came out.

394
00:24:17,361 --> 00:24:21,279
Speaker 1: Every time we ran an event anytime we had a social night any sort of video game anything.

395
00:24:22,203 --> 00:24:26,318
Speaker 1: Pretty much the most popular game was Mario Tennis for the N64.

396
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:32,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'd have a doubles trash talk Mario Tennis tournament all the time, and it was great fun.

397
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,103
Speaker 0: It never failed.

398
00:24:33,584 --> 00:24:38,640
Speaker 1: now granted the trash talk was probably the most important element of the Mario Tennis tournament.

399
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:49,304
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz the thing is once you're good enough and Mario Tennis it sort of becomes in a very even game of you know deuce advantage deuce Advantage deuce.

400
00:24:49,766 --> 00:24:53,539
Speaker 0: I mean one game there one game here one game there one game.

401
00:24:53,559 --> 00:25:03,720
Speaker 1: Scott And I have not played in a long time and before we did the show just now we pulled out Mario Tennis for the GameCube the current best tennis game in the world as far as I'm concerned.

402
00:25:03,901 --> 00:25:05,507
Speaker 1: Yeah, other than I don't know tennis.

403
00:25:05,567 --> 00:25:05,708
Speaker 0: Well.

404
00:25:05,728 --> 00:25:06,792
Speaker 0: There's that virtue of tennis.

405
00:25:07,354 --> 00:25:10,954
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is supposedly I guess that's the best realistic tennis game.

406
00:25:10,994 --> 00:25:15,819
Speaker 1: if you want one yeah But the thing is realism and fun can coincide, but don't always coincide.

407
00:25:15,879 --> 00:25:18,779
Speaker 0: no But I know I've played those virtue of tennis games, and they're pretty good.

408
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:35,040
Speaker 1: But Mario Tennis just has the perfect level of simplicity coupled with the perfect level of complexity to make it just great, but we played it and It was pretty much neck-and-neck the whole time and Scott barely won the first set and then I barely won the second set.

409
00:25:35,622 --> 00:25:37,309
Speaker 1: So great, it's like we didn't even play.

410
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,899
Speaker 0: I got started because during one of the tie breaks I was up.

411
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:44,380
Speaker 0: I was up on top the whole time and I couldn't get down to the bottom and it sucked.

412
00:25:44,923 --> 00:25:47,740
Speaker 1: See I can actually do better at the top than you do for some reason.

413
00:25:48,643 --> 00:25:49,285
Speaker 0: Good at the top.

414
00:25:49,325 --> 00:25:54,440
Speaker 0: see that is something about Mario Tennis right because you're only playing with one screen, right?

415
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,525
Speaker 0: It's one television.

416
00:25:55,566 --> 00:25:56,470
Speaker 0: everyone is sharing it.

417
00:25:56,511 --> 00:26:02,480
Speaker 0: right if you play multiplayer Someone's gonna be on the top half of the screen trying to hit the ball down.

418
00:26:02,581 --> 00:26:03,005
Speaker 0: It's almost me.

419
00:26:03,065 --> 00:26:04,439
Speaker 0: the bottom half is you're hitting the ball up.

420
00:26:05,082 --> 00:26:08,493
Speaker 0: It's much easier to play when you're on the bottom of the screen hitting the ball up.

421
00:26:08,554 --> 00:26:13,740
Speaker 0: now of course if you play enough games And sets it rotates you so you take turns being on top and bottom.

422
00:26:14,201 --> 00:26:16,548
Speaker 0: But still being on top is kind of suck.

423
00:26:17,069 --> 00:26:17,792
Speaker 0: It's not sucky.

424
00:26:17,852 --> 00:26:20,700
Speaker 0: It's just not as good as being on bottom and ideally.

425
00:26:23,362 --> 00:26:29,940
Speaker 0: Ideally there would be some way to play this game perhaps to the DS Where you know everyone could always be on bottom from their perspective?

426
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:37,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know if we could also have a some sort of Wi-Fi game where we could play it with two wheeze.

427
00:26:37,902 --> 00:26:39,634
Speaker 0: Oh, maybe yeah some Wi-Fi.

428
00:26:39,674 --> 00:26:40,460
Speaker 0: we Mario Tennis.

429
00:26:41,544 --> 00:26:43,751
Speaker 1: Normally, this is the part of the show where I'd talk about.

430
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:49,940
Speaker 1: you know how a Wi-Fi tennis could be great But I know Nintendo is gonna totally fuck that up and not make it worth a damn.

431
00:26:50,181 --> 00:26:52,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course Nintendo's online play is a joke.

432
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,433
Speaker 1: It's laughable.

433
00:26:53,493 --> 00:26:55,119
Speaker 0: It's worthless pretty much.

434
00:26:56,103 --> 00:27:10,962
Speaker 1: I mean like what DS Wi-Fi tried it when it came out and since then Yeah, pretty much ignoring all Nintendo I remember I played a Mario Kart on the Wi-Fi and Everyone I played against quit as soon as I beat them, and it just wasn't fun Nope.

435
00:27:11,303 --> 00:27:12,888
Speaker 1: Well also then after about a month.

436
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,638
Speaker 1: You couldn't even start a game because no one played anymore.

437
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:18,910
Speaker 0: Yep Maybe you can play right now, but I don't even.

438
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,979
Speaker 1: I don't even know where my Mario Kart is.

439
00:27:21,341 --> 00:27:28,859
Speaker 0: I have done with that mine, but yeah, I'm done with that game also anyway, so Mario Tennis, what's this game like?

440
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:35,800
Speaker 0: Well first you basically his is how it's complex, but it's not too complex to be you know, stupid, right?

441
00:27:36,364 --> 00:27:37,291
Speaker 0: So what are the controls?

442
00:27:37,311 --> 00:27:38,319
Speaker 0: you have a and B that's it.

443
00:27:38,801 --> 00:27:42,800
Speaker 0: Alright, you push a to hit the ball one way you push B to hit the ball the other way.

444
00:27:43,441 --> 00:27:51,500
Speaker 0: But if you you know If you're depending on where your person is your character is in relation to the ball They'll do like a backhand or a forehand.

445
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,656
Speaker 0: so it's like if you want the ball to hook to the left you have to sort of you learn.

446
00:27:55,696 --> 00:28:01,420
Speaker 0: it pretty quickly becomes Intuitive like where if you should push a or B to get the ball to go the way you want it to go.

447
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:01,782
Speaker 0: Well, that

448
00:28:01,822 --> 00:28:10,320
Speaker 1: is one thing that I think this is what makes Mario Tennis really shine Is that most tennis games were either really simple to the point of not even being fun Yeah,

449
00:28:10,381 --> 00:28:12,227
Speaker 0: it was just pong but you had to push a button

450
00:28:12,729 --> 00:28:21,020
Speaker 1: or they were so complex that well to do a backhand You want to hold right and hit B but to do a forehand you want to hold left and hit a after you've stopped moving and to do a blah blah blah blah.

451
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,319
Speaker 1: But and those games were just impossible to play and not fun.

452
00:28:24,801 --> 00:28:28,269
Speaker 1: Mario Tennis boiled it down to this somewhat intuitive system.

453
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:41,772
Speaker 1: and even better if you don't know the system exists if you just pick up a controller and play Mario Tennis having no idea or keep hitting a and always do the Asia or B or A and B And you'll no matter what you hit the game's gonna work.

454
00:28:41,872 --> 00:28:48,803
Speaker 0: Okay, it's like there's multiple levels I can play the game at but someone who knows all the buttons is gonna own you because they're always gonna hit the ball far Away.

455
00:28:48,843 --> 00:28:51,440
Speaker 0: who you can't reach it every time and you're gonna be screwed.

456
00:28:51,681 --> 00:28:56,860
Speaker 1: Yep, and there's basically the game boils down to the front-back game and the left-right game much like real tennis.

457
00:28:57,212 --> 00:29:12,080
Speaker 0: Yep you're either trying to hit the ball over the guy's head when he's very close to the net or Right or just over the net onto the ground when he's far away from the net or when he's to the right head to the left when he's the left hit it to the right and That's pretty much all there is.

458
00:29:12,301 --> 00:29:23,160
Speaker 1: I used to play tennis with Luke actual tennis back at RIT and I remember that my strategy Was to win was pretty much Hit it to the left and right and left and right to make him run back and forth until he was too tired to play.

459
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,347
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's that's it works really well.

460
00:29:25,528 --> 00:29:26,151
Speaker 0: That's the only way to.

461
00:29:26,171 --> 00:29:27,155
Speaker 0: that's how tennis works.

462
00:29:27,737 --> 00:29:28,440
Speaker 1: Nah, really?

463
00:29:29,841 --> 00:29:32,609
Speaker 0: Now as I'm our dentist works except for the tired part.

464
00:29:33,231 --> 00:29:47,286
Speaker 1: now Scott seems to always play boo duh, which sometimes bites him in the arse because boo in see the doubles play will get to but in single play Boo has some substantial Drawbacks.

465
00:29:47,427 --> 00:29:49,460
Speaker 0: Well, he's kind of slow, right?

466
00:29:49,841 --> 00:30:00,640
Speaker 0: So the problem here is that if you play in a court with a fast ball speed Boo will sort of get owned because there's not much he can do to go after the ball cuz he's so slow.

467
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:06,080
Speaker 1: So so Scott whenever he wants to play against us always wants to use the slow ass courts.

468
00:30:06,281 --> 00:30:06,822
Speaker 0: That's right.

469
00:30:07,003 --> 00:30:10,815
Speaker 0: Slow court is best for boo because boo has the trickiest shots.

470
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:17,880
Speaker 0: if boo gets the ball He can't hit it particularly hard, but you can always hit it in some tricky place and totally screw you up.

471
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:22,907
Speaker 0: He'll get you to come right up in front of the net and then I'll hit it way over the back your head and then What can you do?

472
00:30:22,967 --> 00:30:24,239
Speaker 0: nothing of course.

473
00:30:25,561 --> 00:30:34,436
Speaker 1: Some people prefer to use the kid Koopa who just as I recall in the most recent game Beat boo pretty handily wasn't even a tie break in the third set.

474
00:30:34,757 --> 00:30:36,364
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter He was hit.

475
00:30:36,705 --> 00:30:38,854
Speaker 0: first of all, we won the same number of games.

476
00:30:38,975 --> 00:30:43,560
Speaker 1: I won 17 gasps But all that matters in tennis is who wins the number of sets to get the match.

477
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:44,142
Speaker 0: I know.

478
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:48,956
Speaker 1: and uh, I won two sets and there was no tiebreaker in that last set.

479
00:30:49,037 --> 00:30:50,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was still bullshit.

480
00:30:50,566 --> 00:31:00,233
Speaker 0: Anyway, oh, yes Considering the fact that it was boo in singles who has a significant disadvantage in singles and I and I won the same number of Games as you playing on that slow car.

481
00:31:00,253 --> 00:31:01,820
Speaker 0: No, that was the normal court.

482
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,412
Speaker 0: Yeah, your information not the slow court play on the fast court.

483
00:31:05,432 --> 00:31:05,954
Speaker 1: See how you do.

484
00:31:05,974 --> 00:31:06,978
Speaker 0: No, I won't be boo.

485
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:10,508
Speaker 1: I play a very Specified specific use character.

486
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:13,020
Speaker 0: I'd be probably paratroopa or Yoshi or something.

487
00:31:13,941 --> 00:31:18,439
Speaker 1: See, I always like in kid Koopa no matter what it's cuz kid Koopa is sort of all-around ish.

488
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,152
Speaker 1: Well, no because I like kid Koopa when it comes to games like that.

489
00:31:21,172 --> 00:31:24,224
Speaker 1: I pretty much Always choose the character.

490
00:31:24,264 --> 00:31:27,494
Speaker 1: I like the most and then whatever style that character plays in.

491
00:31:28,175 --> 00:31:29,720
Speaker 1: I'll just play in that style.

492
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:30,710
Speaker 0: That's what I do too.

493
00:31:30,791 --> 00:31:34,094
Speaker 0: Except for You know, sometimes I pick the character.

494
00:31:34,114 --> 00:31:43,408
Speaker 0: I like the most boo But occasionally there'll be a situation where the character can't win and in those cases, I won't pick those cases I'll keep playing my man.

495
00:31:43,429 --> 00:31:45,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, you just lose on purpose.

496
00:31:45,942 --> 00:31:49,796
Speaker 1: No, because that I have dedication and it increases my skill.

497
00:31:49,816 --> 00:31:52,423
Speaker 1: and if I do win epic Yeah If what?

498
00:31:52,463 --> 00:31:57,952
Speaker 0: if there's a what if you know that there's absolutely no chance of winning in the current set of Circumstances with the character you like?

499
00:31:58,093 --> 00:32:06,269
Speaker 1: there's no Nintendo game That's like that except Mario Kart and it just so happened that in Mario Kart for the DS the character I liked was dry bones.

500
00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:08,079
Speaker 1: who happens to be the unbeatable character?

501
00:32:09,602 --> 00:32:10,247
Speaker 0: Good for you.

502
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:10,992
Speaker 1: Yes.

503
00:32:11,153 --> 00:32:12,120
Speaker 1: Yes, very good for me.

504
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,887
Speaker 0: I think the thing is, you know, what if you?

505
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:18,285
Speaker 0: what if there was a situation in which there was a course in which dry bones Could not possibly win.

506
00:32:18,647 --> 00:32:20,134
Speaker 0: Would you pick dry bones on that course?

507
00:32:20,215 --> 00:32:20,496
Speaker 0: Yes.

508
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:22,427
Speaker 0: All right anyway.

509
00:32:23,884 --> 00:32:30,000
Speaker 0: So you hit A and B. One is like forehand ones backhand ish or like top spin and backspin or whatever they want to call it.

510
00:32:30,441 --> 00:32:36,470
Speaker 0: But you can also go AB like you push A and then B really quickly not at the same time But one after the other like AB.

511
00:32:37,115 --> 00:32:44,662
Speaker 0: if you do that You do this sort of lob move that hits it way up in the air and over the other guy's head or BA is You know, it'll come in.

512
00:32:44,702 --> 00:32:49,097
Speaker 1: Yes, you can also go AA and BB and do like power shots.

513
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:49,618
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

514
00:32:49,638 --> 00:32:50,783
Speaker 0: Yeah Oh, that's right.

515
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:52,833
Speaker 0: If you do that, it's sort of a charge up shot.

516
00:32:52,954 --> 00:32:56,092
Speaker 0: And yeah, yeah, that's right You charge it up and lady.

517
00:32:56,113 --> 00:33:02,830
Speaker 0: That's why I won maybe but in uh What's it called in the original Mario tennis?

518
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:05,740
Speaker 0: Not the original but the n64 mario 10 the real original.

519
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,054
Speaker 1: We're not gonna bother pretend the virtual boy one doesn't exist as far as I'm concerned.

520
00:33:09,074 --> 00:33:14,824
Speaker 0: this to n64 GameCube And that's it and we in the future In that one.

521
00:33:14,865 --> 00:33:23,333
Speaker 0: if there was always a problem where people would charge up their shots by accident And then when you're charging up, you can't really move So people would miss and be like fuck.

522
00:33:23,373 --> 00:33:24,379
Speaker 0: I didn't want to charge up.

523
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:26,972
Speaker 1: There's a secret way around that that I didn't push.

524
00:33:26,992 --> 00:33:28,780
Speaker 0: see you cancel the charge.

525
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:30,587
Speaker 1: No one knows that.

526
00:33:30,627 --> 00:33:42,387
Speaker 1: if you're ever in a mario 64 tennis tournament Hit Z or as my strategy was I just held Z down all the time So you never charged up.

527
00:33:42,528 --> 00:33:43,814
Speaker 1: no never I did.

528
00:33:43,874 --> 00:33:44,256
Speaker 1: Okay.

529
00:33:44,517 --> 00:33:47,965
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not bad But yeah You'll never charge up accident that way.

530
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:52,400
Speaker 0: in the GameCube one charging up by accident is much less of a problem.

531
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:56,020
Speaker 1: It can't happen but happen to me like four times, but it can indeed happen.

532
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:00,056
Speaker 0: But then again charging up on purpose can provide you with quite the powerful shot.

533
00:34:00,076 --> 00:34:01,040
Speaker 0: They can't be returned.

534
00:34:01,482 --> 00:34:03,093
Speaker 1: Yeah, these games are just fantastic.

535
00:34:03,133 --> 00:34:07,793
Speaker 1: now the GameCube one had these power shots.

536
00:34:07,873 --> 00:34:18,080
Speaker 1: these like power-up charge yeah, like super moves like the tennis equivalent of hadouken or hurricane kick and they also have the Beginner normal and advanced mode in terms of how to control those things.

537
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:27,199
Speaker 1: I don't want to talk about how the game works too much But basically with the out these offensive and defensive power moves and the offensive move makes it very likely you're gonna score.

538
00:34:27,802 --> 00:34:29,991
Speaker 1: The defensive move saves your ass.

539
00:34:30,431 --> 00:34:32,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, like if someone hits the ball way over your head.

540
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,331
Speaker 0: There's no way you can get it, but you have a special move ready.

541
00:34:35,955 --> 00:34:37,260
Speaker 0: use it and you you know.

542
00:34:37,501 --> 00:34:44,257
Speaker 0: Even if you know they return it for the score You you did the best you possibly could have you returned the ball one more time and there was.

543
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:45,060
Speaker 0: you were gonna lose it.

544
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,958
Speaker 0: Anyway, it might as well go for it.

545
00:34:47,183 --> 00:34:49,349
Speaker 1: Yep Now a lot of people claim that the moves are BS.

546
00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:56,320
Speaker 1: a lot of people complain that by using those moves or by having those Moves in there they'll say oh you only got the point because you had your stupid power charged up.

547
00:34:56,882 --> 00:34:58,472
Speaker 0: Get the power charge at the same time.

548
00:34:58,572 --> 00:34:59,980
Speaker 0: Well, actually you can also use taunts.

549
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:04,560
Speaker 0: You don't get it at the same time relatively the same because I always a number of return thingies.

550
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,065
Speaker 1: It's not the only factors guy.

551
00:35:06,166 --> 00:35:07,611
Speaker 0: I know but it's it's the most important.

552
00:35:07,651 --> 00:35:08,233
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

553
00:35:08,313 --> 00:35:08,715
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is.

554
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:09,558
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

555
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:09,899
Speaker 0: it is.

556
00:35:10,301 --> 00:35:13,280
Speaker 1: Okay, I'll look I'll show I'll show you on game facts exactly what it is.

557
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:19,940
Speaker 1: but anyway anyway the The deal there is that you'll get in pretty much the same amount and you can use taunts to remove the power from people.

558
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:21,840
Speaker 1: So anybody complains about that is just full of crap.

559
00:35:22,201 --> 00:35:27,317
Speaker 1: If you got a point because of a power shot that means that you were managing your power shots more effectively.

560
00:35:27,337 --> 00:35:31,720
Speaker 0: Yep It's sort of like you have a power meter, but it's not a visible power meter.

561
00:35:31,861 --> 00:35:36,196
Speaker 0: But you can sort of figure out how it works and you'll know when you're gonna get a power shot.

562
00:35:36,276 --> 00:35:41,980
Speaker 0: and it's very rare that You know someone else will have power shots and you won't get them, you know soon enough to save yourself.

563
00:35:42,502 --> 00:35:46,216
Speaker 1: Now the true beauty of this game is the doubles play.

564
00:35:46,557 --> 00:35:50,580
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I mean when we did these trash talk tournaments, we never did single play.

565
00:35:50,662 --> 00:35:51,298
Speaker 1: We wanted to.

566
00:35:51,821 --> 00:35:57,240
Speaker 1: Partly we wanted to force people to pair up into groups of two to make these anime fans talk to each other a little bit.

567
00:35:57,523 --> 00:36:03,513
Speaker 1: Yep, so we did a lot of things like Blindfolded monkey ball where one person is blindfolded the other person just tells them what to do.

568
00:36:03,533 --> 00:36:05,560
Speaker 0: That's good stuff left left right.

569
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:19,700
Speaker 1: But when it came to Mario Tennis this forms some interesting because we ran this in pretty much every event we ever had and Certain teams started emerging and there you'd see like the broken alliances.

570
00:36:19,941 --> 00:36:24,220
Speaker 1: You'd see, you know, the one framed me like hey, we're signed up for the Mario Tennis Tournament, right?

571
00:36:25,722 --> 00:36:29,019
Speaker 1: I already signed up and I'm playing with Pete because you suck.

572
00:36:31,663 --> 00:36:42,276
Speaker 1: And of course the whenever the game actually starts playing in doubles I've noticed something Whenever anyone misses a point or loses, it's never their fault.

573
00:36:42,536 --> 00:36:43,780
Speaker 1: It's always the partners fault.

574
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:56,989
Speaker 0: Exactly exactly like if someone misses the ball when it's coming at them They'll say you weren't behind me covering me and if the other person he just misses it straight out the be like, you know Oh, you got in my way.

575
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,359
Speaker 0: You were all up on the ball.

576
00:36:59,601 --> 00:37:01,350
Speaker 1: And that's what made the trash talk so great.

577
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:06,192
Speaker 1: because we you know, we'd play it and we'd make a point of saying All right, you have to trash talk.

578
00:37:06,413 --> 00:37:07,960
Speaker 1: That's the point of this and we'd even do it.

579
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,172
Speaker 1: We're like the semi finals and the finals.

580
00:37:10,212 --> 00:37:14,232
Speaker 1: instead of being off in whatever room We're in the main room on a big projector.

581
00:37:14,272 --> 00:37:19,206
Speaker 1: We have a big crowd of people watching and Pretty much by the time you got to the final rounds.

582
00:37:19,588 --> 00:37:23,800
Speaker 1: There would be almost no trash talk directed at all between the teams.

583
00:37:24,101 --> 00:37:27,340
Speaker 1: The trash talk was directed almost entirely within the teams.

584
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:34,867
Speaker 0: But you know, it's it's the beauty of the doubles play is that you sort of even if both people are really good You have to coordinate.

585
00:37:34,907 --> 00:37:37,040
Speaker 0: you either have to play front and back or left and right.

586
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,320
Speaker 0: You know one person gets all the stuff on the left side of the court.

587
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,913
Speaker 0: The other person else is up on the right side of the court.

588
00:37:41,014 --> 00:37:44,107
Speaker 1: Well, that's a very Basic pedestrian strategy.

589
00:37:44,188 --> 00:37:50,438
Speaker 0: Well, you have to at least you know cover different parts of the court If you both like get right up on the front, you're you're in trouble playing against someone.

590
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:50,799
Speaker 0: good, you know.

591
00:37:51,141 --> 00:37:53,858
Speaker 0: but you generally you have to cover the whole court with two people.

592
00:37:53,878 --> 00:38:01,816
Speaker 0: and Coordinating which parts of the court you're gonna cover, you know as the game progresses is not you don't have.

593
00:38:01,836 --> 00:38:05,671
Speaker 0: you don't unless you're Siamese twins Sharing the same brain in some way.

594
00:38:05,691 --> 00:38:07,319
Speaker 0: It's not gonna be very easy.

595
00:38:07,339 --> 00:38:09,549
Speaker 1: and Then there was team Scott.

596
00:38:10,113 --> 00:38:11,682
Speaker 0: Oh team Scott undefeated I think.

597
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:16,460
Speaker 1: still I have a feeling that one of the Scots will drag it down if you ever play again.

598
00:38:16,702 --> 00:38:23,360
Speaker 0: I don't know about that Especially since boo is far superior in doubles play because he doesn't have to run around so quickly.

599
00:38:23,641 --> 00:38:30,376
Speaker 0: So you you have one person with a really fast character going around, you know Making all the returns that are really hard to make.

600
00:38:30,617 --> 00:38:37,723
Speaker 0: they you know We're hitting way to the left or way to the right But when the other when the other team hits a nice easy shot right to boo tricky shot, haha You can't return.

601
00:38:37,763 --> 00:38:41,640
Speaker 1: it is a team Scott gonna have to demonstrate this at the New Year's party.

602
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,563
Speaker 0: Maybe they'll have to be some.

603
00:38:42,583 --> 00:38:43,868
Speaker 0: Martin is at the news bar.

604
00:38:43,908 --> 00:38:44,811
Speaker 1: Maybe we should deal.

605
00:38:44,851 --> 00:38:47,380
Speaker 1: just have a Mario Tennis tournament at our party.

606
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,484
Speaker 0: I think maybe we should.

607
00:38:48,504 --> 00:38:49,508
Speaker 1: I think we will.

608
00:38:49,548 --> 00:38:49,869
Speaker 1: we're gonna.

609
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:50,853
Speaker 1: we're going to have.

610
00:38:50,913 --> 00:38:53,583
Speaker 0: maybe I won't play team Scott because I don't know About the other Scott.

611
00:38:53,884 --> 00:38:57,357
Speaker 0: that see notice how I didn't pick a better partner than who.

612
00:38:57,638 --> 00:38:58,240
Speaker 1: are you gonna pick?

613
00:38:58,441 --> 00:38:58,822
Speaker 0: I don't know.

614
00:38:58,862 --> 00:39:01,333
Speaker 0: I'll pick I'll see I'll watch everyone play and then pick is the best.

615
00:39:01,574 --> 00:39:03,000
Speaker 0: cuz I know I'm the first best.

616
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,615
Speaker 1: I have to find out who's the first best but I won the most recent game.

617
00:39:06,696 --> 00:39:07,660
Speaker 0: How about you and me first?

618
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,469
Speaker 1: That that wouldn't be fair.

619
00:39:09,489 --> 00:39:12,380
Speaker 1: Yeah So, uh, he's the most fun.

620
00:39:12,561 --> 00:39:23,140
Speaker 1: I was very diplomatic in my stating of you know maybe half of teams Scott is not as good as it might should be but You're pretty open in your trash talk of the other Scott.

621
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,569
Speaker 0: That's how it has to be with Mario.

622
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,160
Speaker 0: Tennis is wide open trash talk.

623
00:39:26,463 --> 00:39:27,879
Speaker 0: If you keep it in you're ruining the game.

624
00:39:28,342 --> 00:39:35,213
Speaker 1: See at the same time when we're in Scott and I were playing because we hadn't played in a long time I definitely engaged in my post-hoc trash talk.

625
00:39:35,393 --> 00:39:43,894
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can't you always do the yeah I pretty much sat there through the whole game real quiet just playing and when I was losing I just be like when I was winning.

626
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:56,299
Speaker 1: I'd be like and right about through the last two games of the final set, you know match point is when suddenly the Scott How you doing there?

627
00:39:57,742 --> 00:39:59,675
Speaker 1: Huh boo keeping up we're getting tired.

628
00:39:59,695 --> 00:40:02,184
Speaker 0: Yeah Boo's a little tired.

629
00:40:02,225 --> 00:40:04,354
Speaker 0: Maybe we shouldn't have played six game sets.

630
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:05,700
Speaker 1: That's what you're supposed to do.

631
00:40:06,021 --> 00:40:07,489
Speaker 0: I know but it was so long.

632
00:40:07,509 --> 00:40:11,605
Speaker 1: now there there's all this other Shit in the new Mario Tennis.

633
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:16,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, the GameCube one is all those extra bonus modes and courts that do weird stuff.

634
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,371
Speaker 0: And oh, there's always the ability to enable star.

635
00:40:19,411 --> 00:40:27,819
Speaker 0: if you unlock if you beat the game with a character You can play that character with star power which basically means they'll hit harder move faster, etc.

636
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:28,462
Speaker 0: Etc.

637
00:40:28,602 --> 00:40:31,152
Speaker 0: And if you both have star power like you.

638
00:40:31,373 --> 00:40:36,615
Speaker 0: if every player playing has star power It does change the game and it's still even.

639
00:40:36,736 --> 00:40:43,760
Speaker 0: it's not unfair But it's not quite the same as just playing normally and it's not as good and in some ways it is.

640
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,392
Speaker 1: It's very high powered advanced play.

641
00:40:46,433 --> 00:40:51,680
Speaker 1: as in if you're playing that way Someone who isn't skilled at the game pretty much will never get a point.

642
00:40:51,806 --> 00:40:52,341
Speaker 0: Yeah ever.

643
00:40:52,361 --> 00:41:00,571
Speaker 0: but then again if some person has star power and the other person does not the star power person has this Ludicrous advantage they can move so fast and hit so hard.

644
00:41:00,892 --> 00:41:03,460
Speaker 0: the normal non star player basically can't compete.

645
00:41:03,601 --> 00:41:12,079
Speaker 1: but see at the same time the great thing about Mario Tennis is that If you get a great player and a bad player together the bad player will every now and then still like they'll still do.

646
00:41:12,741 --> 00:41:14,989
Speaker 1: Okay, it's like the worst you can be at.

647
00:41:15,009 --> 00:41:22,240
Speaker 1: Mario Tennis is a lot higher than you expect So pretty much anyone who ever plays a Mario Tennis game will always have a good time.

648
00:41:22,694 --> 00:41:24,688
Speaker 1: Yep unless you're not a human being.

649
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:38,060
Speaker 0: the other thing about Mario Tennis is I think the AI is Really good at controlling the the players is bad when you're playing doubles and you have a friend Who's the other person on your team is AI controlled because you can't coordinate with them and that sucks.

650
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:47,043
Speaker 0: But as an opponent the AI isn't half bad and actually when you you can beat the hardest hardest settings of AI the ace setting It's beatable.

651
00:41:47,164 --> 00:41:47,966
Speaker 0: If you're really good.

652
00:41:48,508 --> 00:41:52,200
Speaker 0: It's just also really hard and I think that's exactly how it's got to be.

653
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:56,960
Speaker 0: There's like five different levels of AI difficulty and the easiest is impossible to lose to.

654
00:41:57,783 --> 00:42:02,060
Speaker 0: But you can lose to it if you're a moron and the hardest is possible to beat.

655
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,931
Speaker 0: But you can only beat it if you're awesome and that's it.

656
00:42:05,051 --> 00:42:07,260
Speaker 0: Everything else is perfectly in between where it belongs.

657
00:42:07,444 --> 00:42:07,835
Speaker 1: You know what?

658
00:42:08,841 --> 00:42:13,579
Speaker 1: Team Scott's gonna have to compete because I already picked my partner who AI a I ace?

659
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:27,560
Speaker 1: no No, I just thought back to a time a simpler time before we podcasted where our friend Pete moved to Albany And I went up there to visit and we played some Mario Tennis and I discovered he's not bad at the Martin.

660
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,925
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm not talking about Pete.

661
00:42:29,306 --> 00:42:31,154
Speaker 1: He's not gonna be on my team God.

662
00:42:31,214 --> 00:42:31,455
Speaker 0: No.

663
00:42:31,957 --> 00:42:32,599
Speaker 0: Oh, that's a diss.

664
00:42:33,823 --> 00:42:35,114
Speaker 0: Open with your trash talk there.

665
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:41,260
Speaker 1: I I discovered that there are other people in that former household who were very good at Mario Tennis.

666
00:42:41,541 --> 00:42:42,907
Speaker 0: Are you gonna go that way, huh?

667
00:42:43,168 --> 00:42:46,644
Speaker 1: And I think I remember we were playing with one of the gimmicks So they're the alligators.

668
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:48,978
Speaker 0: I think this is I think this is the other great thing about my.

669
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:55,340
Speaker 0: oh I think the other great thing about Mario Tennis is that unlike so many other games we have like say Soul Calibur.

670
00:42:55,441 --> 00:43:03,142
Speaker 0: Right, maybe I guess I guess a lot of us are good at Soul Calibur But like a few people are so much better right with Mario Tennis a lot it's not.

671
00:43:03,242 --> 00:43:38,082
Speaker 0: it's complex enough to be a fun awesome game, but it's simple enough that people get good at it and enough people have mastered it because it's not so incredibly difficult and thus it actually makes a really good tournament game because a lot of people if you have played it at all are great at it and tournaments are the most fun when you have a ton of people who are all awesome or equally awesome or you're unsure how equally awesome they are and Even if someone's better than someone else is by such a small margin that you're still on the edge of your seat throughout the whole Tournament.

672
00:43:38,565 --> 00:43:40,978
Speaker 1: see that Mario Tennis is a great spectator sport.

673
00:43:41,058 --> 00:43:47,043
Speaker 1: actually It is if you're an anime club or some sort of college club out there or whatever and you need some sort of tennis.

674
00:43:47,063 --> 00:43:54,260
Speaker 1: run a Mario Tennis doubles trash talk tournament and have to make a big deal about the championship.

675
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,405
Speaker 1: You gotta pump everyone up.

676
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:56,850
Speaker 1: you make a beat like this.

677
00:43:56,991 --> 00:43:57,995
Speaker 1: is the championship?

678
00:43:58,256 --> 00:43:59,220
Speaker 1: have a big projector.

679
00:43:59,742 --> 00:44:02,171
Speaker 1: Bring the two teams out one member at a time.

680
00:44:02,231 --> 00:44:02,934
Speaker 1: talk to him a bit.

681
00:44:03,415 --> 00:44:04,640
Speaker 1: you can do something pretty epic.

682
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,248
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is I'm worried about Mario Tennis.

683
00:44:07,308 --> 00:44:11,180
Speaker 1: we right because if they use the waggles it's gonna ruin that game.

684
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,664
Speaker 0: Well, it depends.

685
00:44:12,785 --> 00:44:16,055
Speaker 0: I mean I could see good waggles and I can see bad.

686
00:44:16,235 --> 00:44:17,579
Speaker 1: I cannot see a good waggle.

687
00:44:18,564 --> 00:44:22,422
Speaker 0: I could see a good wag maybe waggle to activate powers Hmm.

688
00:44:22,944 --> 00:44:31,415
Speaker 0: I see good waggle is like swing to the right for the a and swing to the left for the B Maybe something like something like that I think could work.

689
00:44:31,497 --> 00:44:38,506
Speaker 0: but It's gonna be rough because if they try to make it full-on like Mario for it like Wii Sports Tennis That's not gonna be good.

690
00:44:38,566 --> 00:44:39,851
Speaker 1: Wii Sports Tennis wasn't full-on.

691
00:44:39,891 --> 00:44:41,557
Speaker 1: Wii Sports Tennis was barely a game.

692
00:44:41,577 --> 00:44:42,400
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

693
00:44:43,321 --> 00:44:48,846
Speaker 0: But if they try to make if they try to make it just controllers with no waggle Then it'll basically why.

694
00:44:49,067 --> 00:44:50,213
Speaker 0: why just play the GameCube one?

695
00:44:50,273 --> 00:44:50,655
Speaker 0: Why should I?

696
00:44:50,735 --> 00:44:51,640
Speaker 1: well because they'll probably make it.

697
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:54,171
Speaker 1: I mean you could say that why not play the n64 one?

698
00:44:54,211 --> 00:44:56,220
Speaker 1: because the GameCube one was just incrementally better.

699
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:57,480
Speaker 0: It was incrementally better.

700
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:13,613
Speaker 1: I mean It's not like other games where say Mario 2 is worth playing in and of itself because it's a different game from Mario 3. there's really no reason to play Smash Brothers 64 or Mario 10 is 64 if you have the GameCube ones.

701
00:45:13,633 --> 00:45:14,296
Speaker 1: just no reason.

702
00:45:14,356 --> 00:45:16,987
Speaker 0: There's different Arenas and stuff.

703
00:45:17,027 --> 00:45:18,052
Speaker 1: There's no real reason.

704
00:45:18,093 --> 00:45:19,480
Speaker 1: It's just an incremental improvement.

705
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,508
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's some reason.

706
00:45:20,548 --> 00:45:21,819
Speaker 1: the game is better in every way.

707
00:45:22,462 --> 00:45:24,008
Speaker 0: It is quite better in almost every way.

708
00:45:24,028 --> 00:45:27,300
Speaker 1: there's really no reason to go back except for a kind of historical.

709
00:45:27,803 --> 00:45:30,220
Speaker 1: This is what these games used to be is there isn't there right?

710
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:35,097
Speaker 0: There is not a reason to play Mario Tennis in the 64 if you have a GameCube there or a Wii there.

711
00:45:35,117 --> 00:45:35,739
Speaker 0: just really isn't.

712
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,859
Speaker 0: I mean except to see what it was like because then it was still a good game.

713
00:45:39,281 --> 00:45:41,550
Speaker 0: But the Mario Tennis of the GameCube is just better.

714
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:43,417
Speaker 0: It's the same game but better in every way.

715
00:45:43,818 --> 00:45:48,372

00:45:49,878 --> 00:45:52,107
Speaker 1: Oh, no I've chosen my partner.

718
00:45:52,127 --> 00:45:55,700
Speaker 1: if Wyatt will step up Wyatt will be my partner.

719
00:45:56,407 --> 00:45:57,559
Speaker 0: I don't know why you don't want to play with me.

720
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,065
Speaker 0: we just win cuz.

721
00:45:59,206 --> 00:46:02,859
Speaker 1: uh, I think that you have to defend the honor of Team Scott.

722
00:46:02,879 --> 00:46:04,847
Speaker 0: and Are you gonna force it?

723
00:46:04,888 --> 00:46:05,532
Speaker 0: Are you gonna force it?

724
00:46:05,552 --> 00:46:06,880
Speaker 1: I don't think I'm gonna force it.

725
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:12,987
Speaker 1: But you get to decide if the honor of Team Scott I mean, I think I think you're.

726
00:46:13,248 --> 00:46:16,057
Speaker 1: would Rocky walk away from a challenge?

727
00:46:16,097 --> 00:46:22,740
Speaker 1: would Rocky say no I'm not gonna box you you're too good or is he gonna step up and say alright, I'm gonna box?

728
00:46:23,101 --> 00:46:28,766
Speaker 0: I think what you've decided is that you know that you and me are pretty equal and you're pretty sure that we're the best And we played the game most reason.

729
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,192
Speaker 1: so I chose the second best person.

730
00:46:30,232 --> 00:46:31,940
Speaker 0: I think I don't know.

731
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:32,441
Speaker 0: You know what?

00:46:39,222 --> 00:46:39,966
Speaker 0: That could be enough.
