1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,588
Speaker 0: It's Monday, February 24th, 2014.

2
00:00:10,588 --> 00:00:10,849
Speaker 0: I'm Rim.

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,100
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,800
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights Tonight, searching for things and how it kind of works.

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,039
Speaker 1: Not really.

6
00:00:21,101 --> 00:00:22,098
Speaker 1: Let's do this!

7
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:31,290
Speaker 0: So I know I talk about skiing a lot, so I'll keep it brief, but this weekend I went out to Vermont for a ski trip with some friends.

8
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,349
Speaker 0: Little couples hanging out in a ski lodge.

9
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:37,530
Speaker 0: It was like the traditional stereotypical ski lodge.

10
00:00:37,952 --> 00:00:38,956
Speaker 0: It had the big fire.

11
00:00:38,976 --> 00:00:40,301
Speaker 0: It had this common area.

12
00:00:40,362 --> 00:00:42,169
Speaker 0: Everyone would hang out there during the night.

13
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,208
Speaker 0: Point the first.

14
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,456
Speaker 0: The bras that like to ski.

15
00:00:46,516 --> 00:00:47,218
Speaker 0: Like, "Yo, brah.

16
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:48,583
Speaker 0: Dude, brah, brah.

17
00:00:48,723 --> 00:00:49,827
Speaker 0: Get some wicked pow pow,

18
00:00:49,867 --> 00:00:50,209
Speaker 0: brah.".

19
00:00:51,393 --> 00:00:52,950
Speaker 0: Those guys are real annoying.

20
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:59,250
Speaker 0: But what I found hilarious was that the four of us went into the hot tub and were hanging out.

21
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,441
Speaker 0: And those bras would come in like, "Yeah!

22
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:04,268
Speaker 0: We're gonna hot tub with our

23
00:01:04,328 --> 00:01:04,629
Speaker 0: beer!".

24
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,329
Speaker 0: And they'd have this big thing of beer with them.

25
00:01:06,912 --> 00:01:10,169
Speaker 0: And then they'd see us adults in the hot tub, and they're like,

26
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:10,229
Speaker 0: "Ah.".

27
00:01:11,593 --> 00:01:13,090
Speaker 0: And then they'd quietly kind of come away.

28
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:16,227
Speaker 0: And then they'd keep peeking in the window like, "Are they gone?

29
00:01:16,287 --> 00:01:16,509
Speaker 0: Are they

30
00:01:16,529 --> 00:01:16,730
Speaker 0: gone?".

31
00:01:16,812 --> 00:01:17,550
Speaker 0: And we weren't gone.

32
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:20,490
Speaker 1: Why don't you just come in and hot tub with the non-bras, brah?

33
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:21,509
Speaker 0: So they did at one point.

34
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,330
Speaker 0: So we were hanging out in the hot tub, and they got in, but I think they only got in.

35
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:25,970
Speaker 0: How big is this hot tub?

36
00:01:26,873 --> 00:01:27,970
Speaker 0: Big enough for about eight people.

37
00:01:28,173 --> 00:01:28,689
Speaker 1: Okay, it's big.

38
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:29,088
Speaker 0: Ga-ga.

39
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,598
Speaker 1: Yeah.

40
00:01:30,392 --> 00:01:38,829
Speaker 0: So they get in with us, and it appears like they keep looking at the girls in our group, because there's two girls in our group.

41
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:48,730
Speaker 0: But once it becomes obvious that those girls are with the guys that are also in the group, they kind of slink away, and they don't really come back to the hot tub.

42
00:01:49,191 --> 00:01:49,455
Speaker 1: Okay.

43
00:01:49,475 --> 00:01:50,350
Speaker 1: Is that your whole story?

44
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,410
Speaker 1: Did you guess you didn't die again?

45
00:01:52,751 --> 00:01:52,954
Speaker 0: Nope.

46
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:53,969
Speaker 0: I almost did, though.

47
00:01:54,713 --> 00:01:55,257
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

48
00:01:55,297 --> 00:01:56,910
Speaker 1: Well, it's getting close to that time.

49
00:01:57,313 --> 00:01:59,190
Speaker 0: So there was a freak weather on the mountain.

50
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:04,490
Speaker 0: So all the powder, the pow-pow, wicked gnar-gnar, all the snow got turned into ice.

51
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:18,050
Speaker 0: Not just solid ice, but imagine a slope, like basically a sheer cliff covered not in snow, not even in ice, but golf ball-sized balls of ice stacked up like four inches thick.

52
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:21,690
Speaker 1: Oh, so not just a sheet of ice, but basically a pile of hail.

53
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:26,330
Speaker 0: So that's what I got to ski on, because a lot of the trails were closed due to icing and other conditions.

54
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,469
Speaker 1: Wouldn't your legs just sort of sink into it and just like shump?

55
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,441
Speaker 0: No, it's solid and hard.

56
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:31,649
Speaker 0: You can't really sink into it.

57
00:02:31,971 --> 00:02:33,430
Speaker 1: Oh, the balls are all stuck together?

58
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:33,737
Speaker 1: Yeah.

59
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:34,132
Speaker 0: Oh.

60
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,063
Speaker 0: So basically a bunch of trails were closed.

61
00:02:37,103 --> 00:02:42,870
Speaker 0: I went off on my own at one point, because I platted this path down, like I'll take this trail to this trail to this trail, because it's a bigger mountain.

62
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:47,690
Speaker 1: And let's see, past the Death Gulch into the Spiky Rock Gorge.

63
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:47,971
Speaker 1: Yep.

64
00:02:48,071 --> 00:02:53,090
Speaker 0: So imagine if, I think, I'm going to go take Frolic to Bunny Buster.

65
00:02:53,772 --> 00:03:09,530
Speaker 0: So I go down Frolic, and Bunny Buster's closed, and then all the other trails along that way are closed, and eventually I hit a spot where the only way down that takes me in the direction I need to go, as in the correct side of the mountain, is this crazy-ass double black cliff covered in ice.

66
00:03:09,872 --> 00:03:12,569
Speaker 0: that doesn't look like anyone has actually skied it yet that day.

67
00:03:12,872 --> 00:03:14,049
Speaker 1: All right, but wait, that's open?

68
00:03:14,813 --> 00:03:15,710
Speaker 0: Well, it is not.

69
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,050
Speaker 1: And the other things are not open?

70
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,969
Speaker 0: There was a rope in front of it that said "Danger Experts

71
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:21,090
Speaker 0: Only."

72
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,340
Speaker 0: Thin cover, ice.

73
00:03:23,863 --> 00:03:24,910
Speaker 0: But it didn't say closed.

74
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:39,310
Speaker 0: There wasn't really another way down, because it was getting near the end of the day, and I had to get back to the, like, there's so many lodges, and I had to get to the right one, so I didn't have time to go down the other side of the mountain, because then the lifts would have closed, and I couldn't have easily gotten back.

75
00:03:39,771 --> 00:03:43,410
Speaker 0: So fuck it, I just went down this thing, and it was terrifying.

76
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:45,389
Speaker 1: Yeah, Death Gulch.

77
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,710
Speaker 0: It was also kind of awesome.

78
00:03:47,715 --> 00:03:48,110
Speaker 1: You're lucky.

79
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:49,170
Speaker 1: Or skilled.

80
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,030
Speaker 1: I've only got, like, maybe ten ski trips left.

81
00:03:51,211 --> 00:03:52,529
Speaker 0: I'm either lucky or skilled.

82
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,389
Speaker 0: You should come skiing sometime.

83
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,349
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm gonna stay alive.

84
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:57,550
Speaker 0: All right.

85
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:58,388
Speaker 1: And we're here where it's safe.

86
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,889
Speaker 0: Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

87
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:07,250
Speaker 0: You're probably more likely to die being hit on your bike by a car than I am to die on the ski slope.

88
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:07,836
Speaker 1: I have other adventures.

89
00:04:07,856 --> 00:04:09,309
Speaker 1: Also, you know what the other problem with skiing is?

90
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:13,026
Speaker 1: Even if we, you know, I always make fun of skiing, like, you're gonna die, and that is totally true.

91
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:18,649
Speaker 1: But there is another major, even if we forget that problem with skiing, that you will die.

92
00:04:18,913 --> 00:04:20,269
Speaker 1: And we just completely forget about that.

93
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:25,690
Speaker 1: There's another problem with skiing, and you know what, I'll even admit, going fast down a thing is fun.

94
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,109
Speaker 0: It's way fun.

95
00:04:27,693 --> 00:04:29,469
Speaker 1: No one can deny that, roller coasters.

96
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, imagine a roller coaster you control.

97
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,701
Speaker 1: Biking down a hill, right?

98
00:04:33,782 --> 00:04:34,609
Speaker 1: No one denies that.

99
00:04:35,131 --> 00:04:36,310
Speaker 1: There's another problem with skiing.

100
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:36,907
Speaker 0: It's cold?

101
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,840
Speaker 1: It's cold and wet.

102
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:38,590
Speaker 1: Fuck that shit.

103
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,130
Speaker 0: You know what, it's not wet most of the time.

104
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:41,954
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

105
00:04:41,974 --> 00:04:44,870
Speaker 1: When that snow touches you, you are warm because you're a human body.

106
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,550
Speaker 1: It melts on you, then it's cold, and then wind blows on you.

107
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,895
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what I have?

108
00:04:49,076 --> 00:04:52,630
Speaker 0: I have a large array of expensive, protective gear.

109
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,110
Speaker 1: Fuck that shit, I'll stay inside.

110
00:04:54,452 --> 00:04:54,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

111
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:55,563
Speaker 0: You know what's inside?

112
00:04:55,665 --> 00:04:55,950
Speaker 0: Warm.

113
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,010
Speaker 0: In fact, you know what, I could use that same gear to bike in the cold.

114
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:06,840
Speaker 1: You know what, all day on frickin' Sunday, I had, not only was I inside in the warm, right, I had my oven on, 475, it was warm.

115
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,470
Speaker 1: And I was going, ah, I don't even need no hot tub, it's so warm.

116
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,690
Speaker 0: When we got home on Sunday, I went running in shorts.

117
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,502
Speaker 1: And then, I had the oven on, and when I opened the oven, bread came out.

118
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:16,650
Speaker 1: No bread coming out of skis.

119
00:05:16,851 --> 00:05:18,039
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know where bread came out?

120
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,610
Speaker 0: Here's the thing, you ski all day, right?

121
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:25,350
Speaker 0: And then when the skiing's done, you go to the lodge, and then you get food at the restaurants by the ski lodge.

122
00:05:25,971 --> 00:05:27,049
Speaker 0: And that's some good food.

123
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,169
Speaker 1: That's not bread you made.

124
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what, I ate bread at a place called The Garlic.

125
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:32,468
Speaker 1: Okay.

126
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,530
Speaker 0: It was pretty garlic.

127
00:05:34,431 --> 00:05:35,227
Speaker 1: No, I hope so.

128
00:05:35,571 --> 00:05:37,330
Speaker 0: It was, garlic happened.

129
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,830
Speaker 1: Is it sort of a sister restaurant to Salt and Fat?

130
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:43,070
Speaker 0: Imagine if Salt and Fat were just garlic and garlic.

131
00:05:43,591 --> 00:05:43,909
Speaker 1: Okay.

132
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:52,030
Speaker 0: The poster was, the sign was basically just this huge, huge three-dimensional bulb of garlic.

133
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,142
Speaker 1: Alrighty.

134
00:05:53,773 --> 00:05:54,368
Speaker 0: It was good times.

135
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,029
Speaker 1: Can you access this restaurant without skiing?

136
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:58,834
Speaker 0: Yes, you can drive to it.

137
00:05:58,874 --> 00:06:08,370
Speaker 0: Though, I point out, I ski, I'm not a professional skier, but I ski, I'm interested in challenges and technical courses and whatever, so I don't drink while I'm skiing.

138
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,889
Speaker 0: I drink after I'm done skiing.

139
00:06:12,295 --> 00:06:14,689
Speaker 0: At many of the resorts I go to- That's true for most people.

140
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:15,025
Speaker 0: I know.

141
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,409
Speaker 1: There are bars that are not at the top of the mountain- In the middle.

142
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,129
Speaker 0: And are not at the bottom of the mountain, meaning you have to ski to them and from them.

143
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:22,526
Speaker 0: Yeah.

144
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:28,177
Speaker 1: You just ski, you stop, there's a guy literally hands you a beer out like a window of a cart, like it's a-.

145
00:06:28,991 --> 00:06:31,150
Speaker 0: You've never been to the West Indies.

146
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,430
Speaker 0: You don't know what it looks like up there.

147
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:37,950
Speaker 1: I actually, one time we walked down a mountain in Israel and at the bottom there was a guy hand lemonade stand in the best possible place.

148
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:38,570
Speaker 0: Oh, at the bottom?

149
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,869
Speaker 1: At the end of a long hike, yeah.

150
00:06:40,111 --> 00:06:44,489
Speaker 0: Okay, so lemonade stand at the bottom of a mountain is the same as ski chalet at the middle of a mountain.

151
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:45,281
Speaker 0: Okay.

152
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:45,927
Speaker 0: Yeah.

153
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:47,029
Speaker 0: So you got any tech news?

154
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:48,770
Speaker 1: Hey, tech news.

155
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,190
Speaker 1: Well, I got two things that are sort of not quite news, not quite thing of the day.

156
00:06:53,051 --> 00:06:58,189
Speaker 1: So I'll use the one that's actually written recently as in two days ago as the news one.

157
00:06:58,496 --> 00:06:58,808
Speaker 1: All right.

158
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:03,165
Speaker 1: This guy, Scott Hanselman wrote an article, "Microsoft killed my

159
00:07:03,205 --> 00:07:03,486
Speaker 1: pappy.".

160
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:04,603
Speaker 1: All right.

161
00:07:05,452 --> 00:07:06,329
Speaker 1: I saw a link to that.

162
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:06,559
Speaker 1: Right.

163
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:14,669
Speaker 1: So what the article is about is, you know, how you have like a feud with someone and you'd be like, "That there family done 20 years ago killed my grand--".

164
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:16,290
Speaker 0: What, the Hetzfelds and the McCoys?

165
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,126
Speaker 1: "Grand pappy, so now I hate some

166
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:18,328
Speaker 1: too."

167
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:18,686
Speaker 1: Right?

168
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,710
Speaker 1: So basically there's people now who just, Microsoft is his example, right?

169
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,250
Speaker 1: But they just be hating Microsoft.

170
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:26,710
Speaker 1: And you know what?

171
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:30,710
Speaker 1: Back in the day, you know, like 2000, there were reasons for that.

172
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,170
Speaker 0: Well, remember, IBM used to be the good guy, then they were the bad guy.

173
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,970
Speaker 0: Microsoft was the good guy, then the bad guy.

174
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,470
Speaker 0: And now almost the good guy again.

175
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,569
Speaker 1: But it's like, you look, what is Microsoft doing now?

176
00:07:39,012 --> 00:07:41,010
Speaker 1: They're not doing their antitrust nonsense.

177
00:07:41,571 --> 00:07:50,070
Speaker 1: They're not, you know, 90% of the evil things that were the reasons that, you know, Bill Gates with a Borg thing on his face was the icon of Microsoft on Slashdot.

178
00:07:50,891 --> 00:07:56,428
Speaker 1: All those things that they did then, most of those things, almost all of them actually, they no longer do.

179
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:01,750
Speaker 1: But people still be, are so, even I have a coworker who's even like, he just, "Ugh, Microsoft is worse, duh.

180
00:08:02,054 --> 00:08:02,277
Speaker 1: It's so

181
00:08:02,318 --> 00:08:02,623
Speaker 1: bad.".

182
00:08:03,114 --> 00:08:03,270
Speaker 1: Right?

183
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,410
Speaker 0: You know, I enjoy people like that.

184
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,008
Speaker 0: I always ask, "Oh yeah, what have they done

185
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:06,190
Speaker 0: recently?".

186
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,630
Speaker 1: He won't do any Microsoft anything.

187
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,610
Speaker 1: He'll buy a PlayStation, he won't buy an Xbox, right?

188
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:09,774
Speaker 1: Wow.

189
00:08:10,432 --> 00:08:12,530
Speaker 1: It's like, okay, whatever.

190
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,230
Speaker 1: And it's like, they're just so, "Oh, Windows is garbage, right?

191
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,344
Speaker 1: Your registry fills up with

192
00:08:16,364 --> 00:08:16,587
Speaker 1: stuff.".

193
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,258
Speaker 1: And I'm like,

194
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:17,829
Speaker 1: "So?".

195
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,135
Speaker 0: Yeah, 1998 called.

196
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:19,838
Speaker 0: Right.

197
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,589
Speaker 0: They want their Windows problems back.

198
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:22,146
Speaker 1: Exactly.

199
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:25,090
Speaker 1: And it's like, even if the registry fills up with stuff, what does that matter?

200
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,490
Speaker 1: It doesn't, my computer works just fine.

201
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, what the fuck are you installing, dude?

202
00:08:29,597 --> 00:08:29,770
Speaker 1: Right.

203
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:35,909
Speaker 1: It's like, they're all complaining about their Macs being slow and running out of memory because OS X memory management is garbage, and I'm like, "My Windows computer works just

204
00:08:35,994 --> 00:08:36,246
Speaker 1: fine.".

205
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:37,607
Speaker 1: And they're like, "No, no, no, no, it

206
00:08:37,628 --> 00:08:37,789
Speaker 1: doesn't.".

207
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:38,089
Speaker 1: Yeah, what?

208
00:08:38,371 --> 00:08:39,990
Speaker 0: You can use your GNU Linux desktop?

209
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:40,510
Speaker 0: Right.

210
00:08:40,551 --> 00:08:41,370
Speaker 0: Is that what you're using?

211
00:08:42,091 --> 00:08:42,390
Speaker 1: Anyway.

212
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:50,350
Speaker 1: So, the point is, it just, you know, people be hating on something just because of something they done long ago, and they can't let go of that hate and see the truth of the present.

213
00:08:50,753 --> 00:08:50,867
Speaker 1: Right?

214
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:51,849
Speaker 0: Wait, so haters gonna hate?

215
00:08:52,113 --> 00:08:52,490
Speaker 1: That's right.

216
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:57,549
Speaker 1: And it's, you know, this guy writes this great article about, you know, it's just, it's not very long, but he's like, "Yeah, look at this.

217
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,730
Speaker 1: You know, it's because Microsoft did done kill you off happy.

218
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:08,129
Speaker 1: There's no denying that, but Microsoft today is like the great grandson of the Microsoft that killed your pappy.

219
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,959
Speaker 1: Why are you hating on

220
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,142
Speaker 1: them?".

221
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:13,628
Speaker 0: I mean, if there's a company to hate on in that vein, Oracle was hated on in the '90s.

222
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:14,710
Speaker 1: Oracle is still bad.

223
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,210
Speaker 0: I would still hate on them even today.

224
00:09:16,251 --> 00:09:16,910
Speaker 1: Fuck you, Oracle, today.

225
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:17,709
Speaker 1: You're still evil.

226
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, Ellison.

227
00:09:18,811 --> 00:09:21,650
Speaker 0: I remember you guys are really pushing that CBD TPA bullshit.

228
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:22,070
Speaker 0: Right.

229
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,208
Speaker 1: GoDaddy, fuck you too.

230
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:24,495
Speaker 0: Yeah.

231
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:25,161
Speaker 0: Right?

232
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:25,768
Speaker 1: But you know what?

233
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:33,349
Speaker 1: It's possible, like 20 years from now, GoDaddy will be like the go-to place for domains or whatever, and not the worst absolute place you can possibly go.

234
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:34,368
Speaker 1: It could happen.

235
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:41,130
Speaker 1: And you know, it's like, I know a lot of Jews out there, right, because I know Jews.

236
00:09:41,671 --> 00:09:43,590
Speaker 1: And it's like, they won't buy a Volkswagen because Hitler.

237
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,289
Speaker 1: And it's like, seriously?

238
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:46,889
Speaker 0: That was like 70 years ago.

239
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,286
Speaker 1: Right.

240
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,030
Speaker 1: It's like, seriously?

241
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:48,628
Speaker 1: Really?

242
00:09:49,112 --> 00:09:49,290
Speaker 1: Really?

243
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:54,129
Speaker 1: Am I going to like just not be friends with any German person ever because their grandpa, you know, killed Jews?

244
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,210
Speaker 1: It's like, they didn't do it, right?

245
00:09:57,451 --> 00:09:57,808
Speaker 1: Same deal.

246
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:03,910
Speaker 0: Well, I think, you know, I've noticed this trend because I still read Slashdot, so I can get yesterday's news tomorrow.

247
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:09,695
Speaker 0: But the trouble with Slashdot is that the commentary was 90% of the reason I would read it.

248
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,630
Speaker 0: And the commentary is still pretty good, like the comments.

249
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:17,610
Speaker 0: But comments are the only reason I read sites like Slashdot and Fark.

250
00:10:18,171 --> 00:10:20,990
Speaker 1: I read them so I don't have to visit 20 different news sites and just go to one place.

251
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:29,650
Speaker 0: Ah, but I read the comments because usually the top rated comments will all, like if the article is BS, like they'll immediately like, here's why it's BS, don't bother.

252
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:30,051
Speaker 0: Like.

253
00:10:30,111 --> 00:10:36,330
Speaker 0: I can get a wide range of technical summary and analysis of the article quickly, crowdsource.

254
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:43,187
Speaker 0: But younger kids went onto Reddit or are too stupid about computers to give reasonable commentary.

255
00:10:43,832 --> 00:10:48,311
Speaker 0: So as a result, Slashdot has not gotten more conservative relative to what it was in the 90s.

256
00:10:49,031 --> 00:10:54,864
Speaker 0: It's that everyone who read Slashdot in the 90s is still reading it and has the same opinion on everything that they had in the 90s.

257
00:10:55,631 --> 00:11:01,009
Speaker 0: So Slashdot in the 90s, they were really pro, like all this modern upcoming technology, and now they all hate Google Glass.

258
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,450
Speaker 0: So yeah, that's Slashdot.

259
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:13,028
Speaker 0: But I used Slashdot to find some summary's information about my news because kids don't seem to understand this shit.

260
00:11:14,032 --> 00:11:19,490
Speaker 0: So there was a big news that was making the rounds about how net neutrality is dead, which was a while ago and it is dead.

261
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:24,550
Speaker 0: But now Netflix to pay Comcast for smoother streaming.

262
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,530
Speaker 0: Now that headline sounds like net neutrality is dead.

263
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:32,126
Speaker 0: The reality is it means net neutrality is dead, but not for the reasons you think it means.

264
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:46,310
Speaker 0: So specifically, you want to call out a lot of people, both in person on the Internet, who tried to argue with me because they don't understand the differences between peering, hosting, content delivery networks, cash servers.

265
00:11:47,212 --> 00:11:51,489
Speaker 0: These are all the things that the young people on the Internet don't know and the old people don't bother to explain.

266
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,850
Speaker 1: Very few people really understand all these technologies.

267
00:11:55,491 --> 00:11:57,068
Speaker 0: And it also, it's not... I understand them.

268
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,790
Speaker 0: There's no like succinct explanation.

269
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,409
Speaker 0: Like I'll link to them so you guys can read them.

270
00:12:01,811 --> 00:12:06,769
Speaker 0: Read the explanation of a tier one network and a tier two network and a tier three network in peering.

271
00:12:07,212 --> 00:12:12,150
Speaker 0: And I defy any of you to write reasonable definitions of these, but the core concept is pretty simple.

272
00:12:12,891 --> 00:12:25,624
Speaker 0: If you want to connect to the Internet, you have no leverage, no buying power, nothing to offer anyone, and you live in a place that has probably only one copper cable going into it.

273
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,070
Speaker 0: So whoever owns that copper cable, you're fucked.

274
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:28,948
Speaker 0: That's what you get.

275
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,310
Speaker 0: Maybe there's two copper cables.

276
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,650
Speaker 0: Maybe there's a copper cable and a fiber cable.

277
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:34,928
Speaker 1: Damn, you lucky son.

278
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,188
Speaker 0: Yeah, like my building has...

279
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,288
Speaker 1: At least in the United States.

280
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,710
Speaker 0: I have Time Warner and Fios in my building.

281
00:12:41,155 --> 00:12:41,950
Speaker 0: Already wired up.

282
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,530
Speaker 0: You just say which one or both and they just start working.

283
00:12:45,052 --> 00:12:45,489
Speaker 1: Double it up.

284
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,589
Speaker 1: Put a router on that shit.

285
00:12:47,132 --> 00:12:51,290
Speaker 0: I considered that at one point for a backup, except Time Warner fucking sucks.

286
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:52,949
Speaker 1: Fios is crazy fast.

287
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:57,170
Speaker 0: Time Warner is theoretically... Double, yeah, double at the time when I bought.

288
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:58,078
Speaker 0: Double...

289
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:06,610
Speaker 1: Theoretically within the next four days, Time Warner is going to make my speeds 100 down and 10 up, theoretically.

290
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, you'll have a faster down than me and a way slower up.

291
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:14,889
Speaker 1: They're like, hey, they sent me this letter like, hey, we're upgrading all our shit at no extra cost to you.

292
00:13:15,031 --> 00:13:16,330
Speaker 1: Same plans, more speeds.

293
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:16,685
Speaker 1: Woo!

294
00:13:17,411 --> 00:13:26,504
Speaker 1: Then I got another letter, something that was much less like an advertisement, but was something you're supposed to pay attention to and much more fine print, ignore this and throw it out.

295
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,310
Speaker 1: That was like, yeah, we're charging you more money, asshole.

296
00:13:30,413 --> 00:13:31,790
Speaker 1: It's actually getting close to the point.

297
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:36,943
Speaker 1: I think if I spent 10 bucks more a month, I would get a fuck ton of cable TV, but I'm not doing it.

298
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:37,958
Speaker 1: That's 120 bucks a year.

299
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:39,185
Speaker 1: Fuck you.

300
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,750
Speaker 0: You got to stand strong on that.

301
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:41,330
Speaker 0: Not doing it.

302
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,870
Speaker 0: Plus, that's always an introductory rate.

303
00:13:43,576 --> 00:13:45,150
Speaker 1: Well, no, but yeah, anyway.

304
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I can pirate anything on cable.

305
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:47,690
Speaker 0: That's right.

306
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:48,388
Speaker 1: Can't stop me.

307
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,273
Speaker 1: There's nothing I want to watch.

308
00:13:49,534 --> 00:13:54,588
Speaker 1: and besides, if you get the Korean TV networks with subtitles, maybe I'll pay you.

309
00:13:55,130 --> 00:14:08,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean, if I can take Crunchyroll seven bucks an hour a day, day, month for basically all the anime, it's hard to convince me to pay 70 bucks a month for a bunch of channels that I'm never going to watch.

310
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:13,269
Speaker 1: It's technically 10, which is still more than Crunchyroll, but I'm going to watch less on Crunchyroll than I do.

311
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:13,463
Speaker 1: Yeah.

312
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:13,810
Speaker 1: Anyway.

313
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,489
Speaker 1: So I mean less on TV.

314
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:15,803
Speaker 1: I do.

315
00:14:16,631 --> 00:14:20,470
Speaker 0: Uh, based on these articles, cause when I can tell the agreement is secret, but what happened?

316
00:14:21,011 --> 00:14:26,889
Speaker 0: I'm going to quote this article on market watch, which is not the best website, but it it'll do pig.

317
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,150
Speaker 1: It's better than some guy on the internet.

318
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:29,462
Speaker 0: Yup.

319
00:14:29,611 --> 00:14:42,450
Speaker 0: So basically Netflix has agreed to play Comcast to ensure Netflix movies and television shows stream smoothly to Comcast customers, a landmark pack that could set a precedent for Netflix is dealing with other broadband providers, AKA ending network neutrality.

320
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:52,970
Speaker 0: Now what it says here, quote, in exchange for payment on disclosed payment, by the way, Netflix will get direct access to Comcast broadband network.

321
00:14:54,051 --> 00:15:03,450
Speaker 0: And it goes on about a bunch of other stuff, but it's not, none of the articles I can find are super clear about exactly what Netflix is purchasing and how much they paid for.

322
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,529
Speaker 0: it is completely secret.

323
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:09,410
Speaker 0: So I want to explain the different things that Netflix could have done.

324
00:15:10,271 --> 00:15:20,310
Speaker 0: One, they could have paid Comcast for Comcast to let them host like co-located on their network directly Netflix caching servers or redistribution servers.

325
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:38,330
Speaker 1: Google does this actually at, if you go to like your ISP, like if your ISP is Time Warner, if I went to the Time Warner like place nearby where everything's hooked up, there would be a space in there where there are servers owned and operated by Google that are in there and Google is paying Time Warner money to have those servers be there.

326
00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:38,751
Speaker 1: Why?

327
00:15:38,992 --> 00:15:48,774
Speaker 1: So if I go to Google.com, it loads mad fast because Google servers are right there at Time Warner as opposed to having to go all the way to where Google's shit is and all the way back.

328
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:51,250
Speaker 1: So and what's wrong with that?

329
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:55,512
Speaker 0: So if I want to stream, like say I'm on Time Warner and I want to stream, I'm watching Netflix.

330
00:15:55,793 --> 00:16:06,590
Speaker 0: So my little computer connects through all my network equipment up to my ISP, my ISP then routes that traffic to a higher tier ISP, like one of the bigger networks.

331
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:11,853
Speaker 1: The ISP of ISPs, like if you wanted to open up your own ISP, you would have to go get an account with these guys.

332
00:16:11,934 --> 00:16:17,890
Speaker 0: You could like you could be a tier two and then pay a tier one to get access to the rest of the Internet.

333
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,632
Speaker 0: But I digress.

334
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:26,930
Speaker 0: So so my traffic would go up to my ISP, Time Warner, and then from there they would figure out the route to Netflix's network.

335
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:30,230
Speaker 0: So Netflix has an ISP in their data center.

336
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:35,590
Speaker 0: So let's say Netflix's stuff is on Amazon, so yes, but there's still an ISP, right?

337
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:43,448
Speaker 0: So it then goes through some higher tier network and then to Netflix's data center and Netflix's servers and then back again.

338
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:57,070
Speaker 0: So if all if there's only one route between my ISP and Netflix through, for example, Cogent, because that's the example from this article and that link between the two networks gets overloaded, I'm fucked.

339
00:16:57,431 --> 00:16:59,629
Speaker 1: It's going to be slow or not working at all.

340
00:17:00,132 --> 00:17:01,410
Speaker 0: Now, there's a lot of ways to get around this.

341
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:10,869
Speaker 0: So if they put a Netflix server in Comcast network, then it could route requests to stream directly to that server and never leave Comcast network.

342
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,770
Speaker 1: That'd be really fast, but they'd have to have all the videos on there.

343
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:14,627
Speaker 1: But yeah, it'd be really fast.

344
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:23,470
Speaker 0: Or at least they'd have to have the most popular videos on there and then go on to the mothership for, you know, the one guy who's watching like Lillehammer.

345
00:17:23,651 --> 00:17:27,569
Speaker 1: That's why sometimes one YouTube video is fast, one YouTube video is slow.

346
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:27,849
Speaker 0: Yep.

347
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:36,590
Speaker 0: There was an issue a while ago on Verizon, Fios, where I blocked at my router all of Verizon's caching servers of YouTube because they weren't working right.

348
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,570
Speaker 0: And as a result, my YouTube suddenly got crazy fast.

349
00:17:40,414 --> 00:17:42,030
Speaker 0: But then they fixed the problem and I turned all that off.

350
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,069
Speaker 1: YouTube seems to be good now.

351
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:43,932
Speaker 1: Yeah, it does.

352
00:17:44,796 --> 00:17:55,730
Speaker 0: So to quote this article, in recent months, traffic jams have developed in some of the existing connections through middlemen, so higher tier ISPs, to broadband providers like Comcast and Verizon.

353
00:17:56,170 --> 00:18:01,032
Speaker 0: These bottlenecks included Cogent, which Netflix was using as their primary route to Comcast.

354
00:18:01,574 --> 00:18:06,070
Speaker 0: So Netflix's network was connected to Comcast network through Cogent's.

355
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:14,734
Speaker 0: So one way to fix this would be to have more peering relationships or more routes for people to take.

356
00:18:15,337 --> 00:18:16,766
Speaker 0: So Comcast and Cogent's.

357
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:17,793
Speaker 1: Build a new highway.

358
00:18:17,813 --> 00:18:20,530
Speaker 1: I can't get from Dallas to San Antonio quick enough.

359
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,790
Speaker 0: They could make more connections.

360
00:18:21,931 --> 00:18:29,569
Speaker 0: They could have more ways to connect between these networks, but that just costs both of them money to benefit me and Netflix.

361
00:18:31,091 --> 00:18:40,150
Speaker 0: So our system's kind of fucked up and that there's almost no incentive to increase the sort of inner networkness of the core of the Internet.

362
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:40,471
Speaker 0: Right.

363
00:18:40,572 --> 00:18:43,770
Speaker 1: It's like, OK, Netflix calls up, you know, Netflix and me.

364
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,650
Speaker 1: I have a business arrangement where I give them money and they give me videos.

365
00:18:46,851 --> 00:18:47,031
Speaker 1: Right.

366
00:18:47,212 --> 00:18:47,815
Speaker 1: So we want those.

367
00:18:47,976 --> 00:18:52,250
Speaker 1: me and Netflix both want those videos to be fast so that our money arrangement continues.

368
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,725
Speaker 1: Actually, I stopped buying Netflix.

369
00:18:53,745 --> 00:18:54,130
Speaker 1: I don't have them.

370
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:57,130
Speaker 1: But anyway, Comcast just doesn't give a shit.

371
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,469
Speaker 1: I had to pay them no matter what.

372
00:18:58,631 --> 00:18:59,628
Speaker 1: I'm not going to stop paying them.

373
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:00,371
Speaker 1: Right.

374
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:10,549
Speaker 1: So if Netflix wants to have a throw a direct cable to Comcast, so the videos get to me faster and Netflix can't be their own ISP, at least not yet.

375
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,890
Speaker 1: So but Comcast is like, we don't want to do that.

376
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,060
Speaker 1: Why the fuck would you want to do that?

377
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,150
Speaker 1: They just cost us money.

378
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:18,089
Speaker 1: It doesn't do anything for us.

379
00:19:18,231 --> 00:19:19,870
Speaker 1: We don't care if Netflix is faster or not.

380
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,109
Speaker 1: That doesn't help us in any way.

381
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:21,411
Speaker 0: Yep.

382
00:19:21,511 --> 00:19:25,430
Speaker 0: And there's no competition because most people only have access to one consumer ISP.

383
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:32,310
Speaker 0: So saying we have fast access to Netflix, but they don't doesn't really help them.

384
00:19:32,531 --> 00:19:34,620
Speaker 0: No, nor does it help me because I can't.

385
00:19:34,721 --> 00:19:37,252
Speaker 0: actually there's no way for them to compete for my business.

386
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:37,935
Speaker 1: Comcast is.

387
00:19:37,955 --> 00:19:39,482
Speaker 1: commercials on TV are.

388
00:19:39,542 --> 00:19:41,310
Speaker 1: Netflix is faster if you get Comcast.

389
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,670
Speaker 1: But it's like, I have no choice.

390
00:19:43,312 --> 00:19:43,941
Speaker 1: I'm serious.

391
00:19:44,042 --> 00:19:44,610
Speaker 1: OK, whatever.

392
00:19:44,911 --> 00:19:45,132
Speaker 1: Yeah.

393
00:19:45,172 --> 00:19:52,368
Speaker 1: So if Netflix wants to have this cable directly connected from Netflix to Comcast, but Comcast doesn't benefit from it.

394
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,568
Speaker 1: So Netflix has to pay for it.

395
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:54,911
Speaker 0: Yep.

396
00:19:54,991 --> 00:20:02,389
Speaker 0: So Comcast can sort of extort Netflix because they're under no obligation to increase their links to cogents and cogent doesn't give a fuck.

397
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:03,214
Speaker 1: No, I don't get it.

398
00:20:03,254 --> 00:20:05,410
Speaker 0: Even if they did, it would just cost them more.

399
00:20:05,711 --> 00:20:11,490
Speaker 0: So either Netflix would pay cogent more to work with Comcast, but Comcast could say, screw you, pay me more instead.

400
00:20:11,731 --> 00:20:11,972
Speaker 0: Right.

401
00:20:12,293 --> 00:20:16,570
Speaker 0: So the only way to fix this is legislation and regulation.

402
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:20,110
Speaker 0: The problem is that legislation regulation would likely be corrupt.

403
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:25,050
Speaker 0: So I don't know what to do, but all ISPs, common carrier, fuck you all.

404
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:25,592
Speaker 1: The end.

405
00:20:26,134 --> 00:20:33,970
Speaker 0: But for everything that I can read from all these articles to quote again, in exchange for payment, Netflix will get direct access to Comcast broadband network.

406
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:40,829
Speaker 0: It is highly likely that what this deal is, is that Netflix network will have a direct peering or transit relationship to Comcast network.

407
00:20:41,412 --> 00:20:47,914
Speaker 1: Meaning bypassing physical cables from where Netflix is and where Netflix's servers are to our Comcast.

408
00:20:47,934 --> 00:20:57,553
Speaker 0: They might be cables, they might be cross connects, which are basically just like say I have a server at like NY4, a data center in New York, and you have a server at NY4.

409
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,290
Speaker 0: We just take an ethernet cable and we both have different ISPs.

410
00:21:00,651 --> 00:21:02,810
Speaker 0: We could say, yo, NY4, give us a crossconnect.

411
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,672
Speaker 1: And I think about it.

412
00:21:03,773 --> 00:21:10,570
Speaker 1: Somebody's paying is like a zillion dollars to you to is basically you're standing in a data center and you're holding an ethernet cable.

413
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,620
Speaker 1: You're like, plug this.

414
00:21:11,721 --> 00:21:12,750
Speaker 1: Is this connected to my computer?

415
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:16,390
Speaker 1: Plug this into your router and we'll all be like the whole Internet faster.

416
00:21:16,892 --> 00:21:19,509
Speaker 1: And someone's like, pay me and I'll plug this in.

417
00:21:19,691 --> 00:21:19,913
Speaker 1: All right.

418
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:21,550
Speaker 1: Here's two millions of dollars.

419
00:21:21,873 --> 00:21:22,198
Speaker 1: Fine.

420
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:23,070
Speaker 1: Click done.

421
00:21:23,311 --> 00:21:26,150
Speaker 0: The issue is that the mechanism design of this system is bad.

422
00:21:26,431 --> 00:21:32,069
Speaker 0: The people who can do the most good and make the Internet the best are the people who are the least incentivized to invest in it.

423
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:32,311
Speaker 1: Right.

424
00:21:32,331 --> 00:21:33,096
Speaker 1: You might think it's like.

425
00:21:33,317 --> 00:21:35,210
Speaker 1: all it is, is connecting an ethernet cable.

426
00:21:35,471 --> 00:21:42,229
Speaker 1: Why doesn't everyone who's in the same data center all connect ethernet cables every which way, connecting every possible thing to make tons and tons of routes?

427
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,290
Speaker 0: Well, one, that's complicated.

428
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,809
Speaker 1: Connect cables are really cheap, yo.

429
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:46,433
Speaker 0: Yeah.

430
00:21:46,656 --> 00:21:47,690
Speaker 0: Routing the routers.

431
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,869
Speaker 1: I'm sure the routers have extra ports on them.

432
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:51,095
Speaker 0: It's not just.

433
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:53,650
Speaker 1: I'm sure the routers can figure that shit out on their own these days.

434
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,636
Speaker 1: They're pretty automatic.

435
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:56,910
Speaker 0: Do you do a show on routing protocols?

436
00:21:57,593 --> 00:21:58,260
Speaker 1: It's your favorite.

437
00:21:58,705 --> 00:21:59,210
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

438
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:03,770
Speaker 0: I haven't fucked around with routing protocols on it like personally in over a decade.

439
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:05,148
Speaker 1: Still your favorite.

440
00:22:06,433 --> 00:22:07,970
Speaker 1: It's your second favorite after clock setting.

441
00:22:08,153 --> 00:22:09,370
Speaker 0: Clock setting is still my favorite.

442
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,130
Speaker 0: The fixed protocol is my second favorite.

443
00:22:11,211 --> 00:22:12,127
Speaker 0: So it's down there.

444
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,629
Speaker 0: So read these Wikipedia articles, learn your shit.

445
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:20,270
Speaker 0: Network neutrality is way more complicated than you think it is.

446
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:20,530
Speaker 1: Right.

447
00:22:20,551 --> 00:22:29,770
Speaker 1: But the point is, while net neutrality is under great threat and is very, very important, this is not actually a net neutrality issue.

448
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:39,350
Speaker 1: Net neutrality would be if in the router, in some software, in some instruction, they said, if the packet comes from here, give it a higher priority.

449
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,870
Speaker 1: If it comes from there, slow it down.

450
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:41,613
Speaker 1: They're not doing that.

451
00:22:41,714 --> 00:22:45,792
Speaker 1: All they're doing is rearranging the, you know, the structure of the Internet.

452
00:22:45,852 --> 00:22:53,430
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, if I'm New York and I build a highway to I don't know, I build a new highway to Connecticut.

453
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:58,410
Speaker 1: So Jersey, it's not any faster for people to get from New Jersey to New York.

454
00:22:58,952 --> 00:23:01,309
Speaker 1: It's not like I'm fucking over New Jersey, though we should.

455
00:23:01,892 --> 00:23:02,095
Speaker 1: Right.

456
00:23:02,135 --> 00:23:03,450
Speaker 1: I just built a highway to Connecticut.

457
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:07,570
Speaker 1: So Comcast and Netflix built a highway from Netflix to Comcast.

458
00:23:07,992 --> 00:23:10,230
Speaker 1: Does that mean that it's not neutral?

459
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,470
Speaker 1: They have to build a highway.

460
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:15,090
Speaker 0: Here's why I would say it's related to net neutrality.

461
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:25,949
Speaker 0: The problem I have with this is that companies like Comcast can basically extort companies like Netflix to do arrangements like this.

462
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:26,331
Speaker 1: Yep.

463
00:23:27,033 --> 00:23:31,270
Speaker 0: And really, we need all the tiers to be working together somehow.

464
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:32,790
Speaker 0: I've said it before.

465
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,710
Speaker 0: I've said it for a decade or more.

466
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:35,374
Speaker 0: I'll say it again.

467
00:23:35,394 --> 00:23:37,490
Speaker 0: The Internet needs to be regulated like utility.

468
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:40,470
Speaker 0: It is as important as electricity and water in the modern world.

469
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:43,729
Speaker 1: Your Internet bill should be the same as your electric bill, your water bill, your gas bill.

470
00:23:43,971 --> 00:23:53,369
Speaker 0: Once you've got clean water in your country and electricity, the Internet should be the next thing to be, well, and sewers, then the Internet should be the next thing to be regulated as a utility and guaranteed to all.

471
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,570
Speaker 0: So things of the day.

472
00:24:01,211 --> 00:24:03,250
Speaker 0: Not a big fan of the Olympics as time goes on.

473
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:09,690
Speaker 0: And one of the one of the reasons for that, many reasons to be anti-Olympic, kind of like how convention centers are basically monorails.

474
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:16,151
Speaker 0: The Olympics for most countries are basically monorails, monorails, but not all of them.

475
00:24:16,171 --> 00:24:18,730
Speaker 0: We don't mean monorails as in the train.

476
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:25,785
Speaker 0: We monorail as in a scam like The Simpsons episode, which was based on a movie called The Music Man, which you should all have seen.

477
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:26,550
Speaker 1: all these things.

478
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,269
Speaker 1: If you haven't seen both of those things.

479
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:28,671
Speaker 0: Yeah.

480
00:24:28,852 --> 00:24:31,990
Speaker 0: My Little Pony was not referencing The Simpsons episode.

481
00:24:32,152 --> 00:24:33,970
Speaker 0: They were referencing The Music Man.

482
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:34,494
Speaker 1: That's right.

483
00:24:35,201 --> 00:24:36,070
Speaker 0: That's kind of an aside.

484
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:42,589
Speaker 0: But a lot of kids today, I see them seeing a reference to something and not realizing it's actually a reference to something far older.

485
00:24:42,891 --> 00:24:47,636
Speaker 1: So, you know, right now we're at the stage where it's like, oh, they see something is a reference to something.

486
00:24:47,656 --> 00:24:49,150
Speaker 0: We don't need no stinking badges.

487
00:24:49,471 --> 00:24:49,793
Speaker 1: Right.

488
00:24:50,075 --> 00:24:52,409
Speaker 0: You can tell how old someone is by what they think that's from.

489
00:24:52,791 --> 00:25:03,548
Speaker 1: But you know what's going to be even worse when people make references to something and it's like, no, actually, he was referencing Blazing Saddles because the person who made that is Mad Young and didn't even know.

490
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:04,131
Speaker 1: Yeah.

491
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:13,870
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway, so this is a project, a photo project to go to all the sites of previous Olympics and take pictures of what they're like now.

492
00:25:14,031 --> 00:25:16,230
Speaker 1: Well, I think pretty much comes down to two categories.

493
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:21,842
Speaker 1: Number one, you've got the Olympics that were held near population centers like Atlanta or Vancouver.

494
00:25:21,862 --> 00:25:22,250
Speaker 1: Right.

495
00:25:22,471 --> 00:25:25,570
Speaker 1: And those things, since people live near them, got used.

496
00:25:26,132 --> 00:25:31,613
Speaker 1: And then you've got the Olympics that are sort of out in the middle of fuck nowhere, like in the woods.

497
00:25:31,714 --> 00:25:34,950
Speaker 1: Usually winter Olympics are in the middle of nowhere more often places.

498
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:35,754
Speaker 1: No one goes.

499
00:25:35,774 --> 00:25:38,330
Speaker 1: And those are very derelict.

500
00:25:38,471 --> 00:25:46,410
Speaker 1: And then you've got ones that are sort of in the middle of nowhere, but like get used a little bit, you know, like they're at a ski resort, winter Olympics.

501
00:25:46,931 --> 00:25:48,969
Speaker 1: And maybe some people go there, but not a lot.

502
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,710
Speaker 1: So it's like this ski jump.

503
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:51,634
Speaker 1: You can't jump it.

504
00:25:51,715 --> 00:25:54,830
Speaker 1: It's all rusted and shit, but you can still go ice skating there.

505
00:25:55,271 --> 00:25:55,989
Speaker 1: So you can still go ski.

506
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:59,149
Speaker 0: This is an interesting project that's ongoing and a lot of cool pictures.

507
00:25:59,714 --> 00:25:59,895
Speaker 1: Yeah.

508
00:26:00,903 --> 00:26:01,750
Speaker 0: So it's the thing.

509
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:02,270
Speaker 1: OK.

510
00:26:02,898 --> 00:26:03,525
Speaker 1: My thing of day.

511
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:07,910
Speaker 0: So this site is the worst fucking font ever.

512
00:26:08,391 --> 00:26:09,121
Speaker 0: But I digress.

513
00:26:09,323 --> 00:26:09,830
Speaker 1: It's not too bad.

514
00:26:09,931 --> 00:26:10,316
Speaker 0: It's not.

515
00:26:10,337 --> 00:26:11,310
Speaker 0: No, it's not really the font.

516
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,210
Speaker 0: They've cut off the tops and bottoms of the letters.

517
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:14,098
Speaker 1: Oh, that's a problem.

518
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:14,907
Speaker 0: The all of them.

519
00:26:15,511 --> 00:26:17,530
Speaker 1: Dick, that's that's a problem.

520
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:17,750
Speaker 1: Yeah.

521
00:26:18,173 --> 00:26:24,690
Speaker 1: Anyway, so here's an article from nineteen ninety nine.

522
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:25,453
Speaker 0: Wow.

523
00:26:27,991 --> 00:26:33,750
Speaker 1: It's written by the guy or one of the people who worked on X-Wing versus TIE fighter.

524
00:26:34,832 --> 00:26:34,893
Speaker 0: Wow.

525
00:26:34,933 --> 00:26:39,450
Speaker 0: That game was not the greatest game, but it should have been the greatest game.

526
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:40,934
Speaker 1: Right.

527
00:26:40,954 --> 00:26:47,890
Speaker 1: And he wrote basically all the things they learned programming that shit specifically pertaining to the networking.

528
00:26:48,452 --> 00:26:48,674
Speaker 0: Wow.

529
00:26:48,714 --> 00:26:50,650
Speaker 0: The thing that most games still can't get right.

530
00:26:50,870 --> 00:27:04,570
Speaker 1: And if you read this, most of this shit still holds true today, even though he was working on something with like no dedicated servers and twenty eight eight modems and whatever, trying to make it work and getting it to sort of kind of work.

531
00:27:05,273 --> 00:27:05,961
Speaker 1: OK, ish.

532
00:27:06,366 --> 00:27:06,630
Speaker 1: Right.

533
00:27:08,932 --> 00:27:24,810
Speaker 1: You know, all the stuff that he's talking about still mostly applies to game network programming today, and if you have to program network code for a game, I highly recommend reading this because there really isn't going to be anything more up to date.

534
00:27:25,113 --> 00:27:25,862
Speaker 1: It's going to help you.

535
00:27:26,024 --> 00:27:26,207
Speaker 1: Yeah.

536
00:27:28,252 --> 00:27:30,910
Speaker 1: So, yeah, it is really interesting.

537
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,967
Speaker 0: The book club book is well, we'll start reading it at some point to take a copy.

538
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:36,598
Speaker 0: I got a copy of it.

539
00:27:36,618 --> 00:27:37,749
Speaker 0: I got to find out my copies.

540
00:27:38,231 --> 00:27:43,910
Speaker 0: We're going to be at Anime Boston doing one, not two, not five, not three, but four panels.

541
00:27:44,292 --> 00:27:45,590
Speaker 0: Our schedule is posted on our website.

542
00:27:45,972 --> 00:27:48,330
Speaker 0: We're going to be doing three or four panels.

543
00:27:48,391 --> 00:27:48,999
Speaker 0: I'm not sure.

544
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:49,789
Speaker 0: I got to double check.

545
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,488
Speaker 0: We're going to be at PAX East doing one panel.

546
00:27:53,431 --> 00:27:55,289
Speaker 1: You can tell how important the convention is.

547
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,969
Speaker 1: The more important the convention, the less panels we do nowadays.

548
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,490
Speaker 0: In the old days, we used to do a lot of PAX panels.

549
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:08,633
Speaker 0: And also, if you want to do it as soon as possible, seriously, we're already scheduling.

550
00:28:08,914 --> 00:28:15,390
Speaker 0: If you wait a few like a month to submit your panel, not going to get a good time unless your panels are crazy awesome.

551
00:28:16,411 --> 00:28:23,429
Speaker 1: And of course, you can find us everywhere on the entire Internet that there are things like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, everything.

552
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:27,702
Speaker 1: But I want to specifically mention I have a Twitch account, twitch.tv/APRECHE.

553
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,670
Speaker 0: Scott's Twitch is pretty much the kind of like on my YouTube.

554
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:36,130
Speaker 1: I figured out how to make game videos save and not disappear.

555
00:28:37,271 --> 00:28:43,216
Speaker 0: So sorry to all of you who never got to see that awesome Nidhogg game or that awesome Family Feud game.

556
00:28:43,236 --> 00:28:45,470
Speaker 0: I saved that locally, at least.

557
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:46,132
Speaker 1: Oh, that's good.

558
00:28:46,414 --> 00:28:49,270
Speaker 0: But I've been too busy to actually edit it together into something.

559
00:28:49,431 --> 00:28:53,284
Speaker 1: Anyway, but yeah, and you know, right now, I'm just.

560
00:28:53,786 --> 00:28:55,319
Speaker 1: I just feel like streaming some Pokémon.

561
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:55,830
Speaker 1: Leave Green.

562
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:56,355
Speaker 1: Twitch Plays.

563
00:28:56,395 --> 00:28:57,469
Speaker 1: Pokémon inspired me.

564
00:28:57,872 --> 00:29:01,333
Speaker 1: And when I went to play Leave Green, I was like, whoa, this is even better than I remember.

565
00:29:01,453 --> 00:29:03,145
Speaker 1: Pokémon Leave Green is the best Pokémon.

566
00:29:03,205 --> 00:29:03,970
Speaker 1: I knew that before.

567
00:29:04,091 --> 00:29:04,894
Speaker 1: And I still know that.

568
00:29:04,955 --> 00:29:08,089
Speaker 1: So even if no one watches, I feel like playing it.

569
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:08,713
Speaker 1: So I'm going to.

570
00:29:08,954 --> 00:29:13,409
Speaker 1: And if you watch, maybe you can like nickname some Pokémon because my Pokémon nicknames suck.

571
00:29:13,851 --> 00:29:18,389
Speaker 0: Yeah, I feel like I got to pick a game and stream it regularly, but I got to wait till all this travel is done.

572
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:19,809
Speaker 1: Just do it whenever I feel like.

573
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm going to disappear for a while.

574
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:21,370
Speaker 0: When are you leaving?

575
00:29:22,255 --> 00:29:22,647
Speaker 0: Next week.

576
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:23,790
Speaker 1: Just all next week?

577
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:24,527
Speaker 0: Pretty much.

578
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:25,222
Speaker 1: See ya!

579
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,830
Speaker 0: No Geek Nights next week and maybe the week after.

580
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:33,409
Speaker 0: So, yeah, if any listeners are in London or Mumbai or Kuala Lumpur, let me know.

581
00:29:35,135 --> 00:29:36,449
Speaker 0: I might be able to tell you some of my schedule.

582
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,050
Speaker 0: We might be able to get together, share a pint.

583
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,910
Speaker 1: I guess I'm looking towards some extra net running.

584
00:29:41,117 --> 00:29:41,206
Speaker 1: Yeah.

585
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,349
Speaker 1: With my my free time.

586
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:44,304
Speaker 1: All right.

587
00:29:44,631 --> 00:29:49,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, so search technology, because we realized we might have.

588
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:56,409
Speaker 1: Well, OK, so first of all, we may have done this episode before, but we just did an episode that we did before.

589
00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:02,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, we did an episode on going to the dentist and a great listener pointed out that we had, in fact, already done an episode.

590
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:06,670
Speaker 1: Even though I had searched and not found that old episode, we did do one.

591
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:08,710
Speaker 0: So our search obviously sucks.

592
00:30:09,253 --> 00:30:10,347
Speaker 1: It's Google, so don't blame me.

593
00:30:11,332 --> 00:30:13,910
Speaker 0: There's something wrong with our search anyway.

594
00:30:14,292 --> 00:30:17,109
Speaker 0: Maybe our database is missing something to do with our database.

595
00:30:17,431 --> 00:30:18,240
Speaker 1: It's only Google.

596
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,069
Speaker 1: It's Google search.

597
00:30:19,933 --> 00:30:21,450
Speaker 1: It's not our search anyway.

598
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,330
Speaker 1: Anyway, we failed to find that old episode.

599
00:30:24,391 --> 00:30:25,970
Speaker 1: So maybe this is a rerun as well.

600
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:31,307
Speaker 1: Maybe we have talked about search technology before, in which case this is now rerun month.

601
00:30:31,551 --> 00:30:34,285
Speaker 0: Yep, which is fine because I think this is kind of we're going to do.

602
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:36,890
Speaker 1: if this is a rerun also, then that's hilarious.

603
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:40,410
Speaker 1: Right now, if we know the other one is a real I want to redo some of these shows.

604
00:30:40,491 --> 00:30:41,350
Speaker 0: I'm looking at old shows.

605
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,410
Speaker 0: We did how to not suck at driving.

606
00:30:43,694 --> 00:30:44,850
Speaker 0: How to not suck at life.

607
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:47,670
Speaker 1: If this is also a rerun, we'll make it rerun month.

608
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,850
Speaker 1: If this is not also a rerun, then good.

609
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:50,910
Speaker 1: We're not doing reruns.

610
00:30:51,292 --> 00:30:51,826
Speaker 0: The Scott show.

611
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:57,110
Speaker 0: Worst week, the worst people in history, like Abraham Lincoln and Mother Teresa.

612
00:30:58,072 --> 00:30:58,939
Speaker 0: Yeah.

613
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,230
Speaker 0: Oh, masturbation.

614
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,147
Speaker 0: I'm looking for the episode.

615
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:05,930
Speaker 0: Oh, the word dentist tree appears, but not dentist.

616
00:31:07,072 --> 00:31:10,309
Speaker 1: I think Google should know if I type dentist, the dentist tree is a possible result.

617
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:10,896
Speaker 0: Yes, it doesn't.

618
00:31:11,748 --> 00:31:11,890
Speaker 0: Yeah.

619
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:16,190
Speaker 0: Tonight on Geek Knives, we tell tooth related stories in the news.

620
00:31:16,771 --> 00:31:18,829
Speaker 1: I also search for truth and did not find it.

621
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:22,350
Speaker 0: And Microsoft fires a salvo at Apple in the music market.

622
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,670
Speaker 0: Also catch our appearance on Anime World Order.

623
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,329
Speaker 0: That's a blast in the past.

624
00:31:27,311 --> 00:31:30,530
Speaker 0: Anyway, so but this is an aside.

625
00:31:30,814 --> 00:31:31,470
Speaker 0: I feel like it's cool.

626
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:37,430
Speaker 0: You could listen to the old one and the new one and see if our opinions change without us realizing it between 2006 and 2014.

627
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:43,250
Speaker 1: You just really want to do reruns so you don't have to come up with ideas for new shows because I want to see how much we've changed and I realized it.

628
00:31:43,793 --> 00:31:46,270
Speaker 1: I only want to do reruns if we fucked up that badly.

629
00:31:46,512 --> 00:31:47,950
Speaker 1: Let's try to avoid it if possible.

630
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,990
Speaker 0: Anyway, so this one was your responsibility.

631
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,389
Speaker 1: Captain, I barely searched.

632
00:31:53,391 --> 00:31:57,370
Speaker 1: So search technologies, you know, you go to your Googles or something else simple.

633
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:01,547
Speaker 1: You type in a search term, you press enter and somehow results show up.

634
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:04,348
Speaker 1: Computers have the power to do this.

635
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:09,550
Speaker 0: Now, I want to tell you right now, guys, that's not just a big relational database.

636
00:32:09,972 --> 00:32:13,146
Speaker 0: No, that should stop scaling like 30 years ago.

637
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:14,331
Speaker 1: Right.

638
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:22,529
Speaker 1: So how the computer actually does this is actually really complicated and really hard to do, which is why I let Google do it.

639
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:22,951
Speaker 0: Yep.

640
00:32:23,774 --> 00:32:28,095
Speaker 0: But like my company, we make some software that has to do its own searching and things internally.

641
00:32:28,135 --> 00:32:30,350
Speaker 0: And frankly, there's a lot of Google do that.

642
00:32:30,972 --> 00:32:33,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a lot of ways to do this.

643
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:39,529
Speaker 0: Plus, remember, there was a time I don't know if you still can when you could buy a Google search appliance that would crawl your internal network, can you?

644
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:39,930
Speaker 1: Yep.

645
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:44,915
Speaker 0: Because we had one at my old company completely fucking useless, didn't work for shit.

646
00:32:45,441 --> 00:32:46,230
Speaker 0: It was just awful.

647
00:32:46,892 --> 00:32:48,649
Speaker 1: It's good if you use it for what it was designed for.

648
00:32:48,931 --> 00:32:49,053
Speaker 0: Yeah.

649
00:32:49,094 --> 00:32:50,149
Speaker 0: No, here's one of the problems.

650
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:53,621
Speaker 0: It's license based on the total number of things.

651
00:32:53,802 --> 00:32:58,570
Speaker 0: it will let you like it'll crawl and it just stops once it hits that limit.

652
00:32:59,011 --> 00:32:59,333
Speaker 1: I don't know.

653
00:32:59,555 --> 00:33:02,030
Speaker 1: I don't know how they charge for it now, but you can still get those.

654
00:33:02,351 --> 00:33:02,774
Speaker 0: We had one.

655
00:33:02,794 --> 00:33:03,439
Speaker 0: We tried to use it.

656
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,689
Speaker 0: It just didn't work very well.

657
00:33:05,592 --> 00:33:07,107
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway, who knows?

658
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,590
Speaker 1: That was back then, too, right?

659
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:11,250
Speaker 0: That was like 2008.

660
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:11,652
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatevs.

661
00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:17,434
Speaker 1: So when you go to your computer and you want to search something, what is actually happening?

662
00:33:17,474 --> 00:33:21,973
Speaker 1: Well, let's say you want to search, I don't know, just like a text file.

663
00:33:22,155 --> 00:33:22,377
Speaker 1: Right.

664
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,830
Speaker 1: Well, it's pretty easy to search that.

665
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:33,443
Speaker 1: You type in some text and your computer goes through the text file, comparing your text to all the text in the text file until it sees something that matches kind of inefficient and then it goes up.

666
00:33:33,483 --> 00:33:33,848
Speaker 1: There it is.

667
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:35,369
Speaker 1: But that's really slow.

668
00:33:36,191 --> 00:33:38,270
Speaker 1: And but, you know, if you're just searching a text file is no problem.

669
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:39,769
Speaker 1: But what if it's a really big text file?

670
00:33:39,992 --> 00:33:41,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's gonna be mad slow.

671
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:45,310
Speaker 1: You have to wait for it to get all the way to the bottom of the file every single time.

672
00:33:45,751 --> 00:33:48,890
Speaker 0: Now, you could use a database which up to a certain size works.

673
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:51,150
Speaker 0: OK, because then you can do very complex queries.

674
00:33:51,350 --> 00:34:02,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could be like, you know, select from table where description is kind of like this string of text and date updated greater than yesterday.

675
00:34:02,193 --> 00:34:03,110
Speaker 0: Like anything like that.

676
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:03,572
Speaker 0: You could be.

677
00:34:03,894 --> 00:34:08,638
Speaker 0: So part of what you have to think about is, are you searching, do your searches just do they need to be simple?

678
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,606
Speaker 0: or can you get away with simple?

679
00:34:10,947 --> 00:34:12,610
Speaker 0: or do you need to make complex queries?

680
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:16,088
Speaker 0: The more complex your query is, the harder and slower it is.

681
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:16,831
Speaker 1: Right.

682
00:34:16,871 --> 00:34:24,110
Speaker 1: Well, you know, let's say, you know, if you're doing something with like data, right, like, you know, a database is query is usually all the search power you need.

683
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:29,310
Speaker 1: For example, I need to see all the sales from last month of this product.

684
00:34:29,532 --> 00:34:31,889
Speaker 1: And it's like, well, that's you know, exactly what you want.

685
00:34:31,971 --> 00:34:34,228
Speaker 1: It's incredibly specific and exact.

686
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:34,612
Speaker 1: Yeah.

687
00:34:34,632 --> 00:34:34,813
Speaker 1: Right.

688
00:34:35,016 --> 00:34:36,090
Speaker 1: Give me this data.

689
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:36,451
Speaker 1: Boom.

690
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,033
Speaker 1: Here it is.

691
00:34:37,134 --> 00:34:40,967
Speaker 0: So by having a relational database of that data, it's very.

692
00:34:41,047 --> 00:34:50,830
Speaker 0: it's a very simple structure that allows you to reliably and deterministically get arbitrary chunks of it together, analyzed against each other and interleaved against each other.

693
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:53,270
Speaker 0: You can take data from a bunch of sources and just mash it together.

694
00:34:53,531 --> 00:35:01,490
Speaker 1: No, but if you want to search something that's just like the English language, right, like here, I'm going to type in some words and you find me things that match these words.

695
00:35:02,291 --> 00:35:04,369
Speaker 1: Now things get balls hard really fast.

696
00:35:05,292 --> 00:35:05,412
Speaker 0: Yep.

697
00:35:05,433 --> 00:35:10,454
Speaker 0: So one of the most important concepts in modern search technology is the idea of indexing.

698
00:35:11,058 --> 00:35:12,549
Speaker 1: You know, like an index in the back of the book.

699
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:13,252
Speaker 0: Yeah.

700
00:35:13,272 --> 00:35:13,989
Speaker 1: Think about what that is.

701
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,150
Speaker 1: Imagine if you have imagine just your human being.

702
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:16,816
Speaker 1: You've got a book.

703
00:35:16,917 --> 00:35:18,130
Speaker 1: I give a copy of The Prince of Nothing.

704
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:18,451
Speaker 1: Right.

705
00:35:18,711 --> 00:35:26,412
Speaker 1: And I say find me, you know, I don't know, something about the step and how it's trackless.

706
00:35:26,452 --> 00:35:26,733
Speaker 0: All right.

707
00:35:26,773 --> 00:35:31,797
Speaker 0: So I start reading on now if I remember something like, oh, I think that's in chapter four.

708
00:35:32,019 --> 00:35:33,470
Speaker 0: Then I had a cache already.

709
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:35,290
Speaker 1: You already you already found it before.

710
00:35:35,531 --> 00:35:36,257
Speaker 1: And you're going back to it.

711
00:35:36,338 --> 00:35:37,570
Speaker 0: So let's say my cache is empty.

712
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:38,702
Speaker 0: I've never read this book before.

713
00:35:38,944 --> 00:35:39,430
Speaker 0: So what do I do?

714
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:40,949
Speaker 0: I start reading the whole fucking book.

715
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,003
Speaker 1: Takes for fucking ever.

716
00:35:42,024 --> 00:35:42,166
Speaker 1: Right.

717
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,270
Speaker 0: But even then, what do I return?

718
00:35:44,711 --> 00:35:46,750
Speaker 0: So I find the word step.

719
00:35:47,071 --> 00:35:48,870
Speaker 0: Do you want that sentence, that chapter?

720
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:51,330
Speaker 0: Do I just give you the word step a hundred times?

721
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:52,875
Speaker 0: Does the page number?

722
00:35:52,915 --> 00:35:56,137
Speaker 1: What if there's another place that talks about the trackless step even more?

723
00:35:56,157 --> 00:35:57,810
Speaker 0: Do I return the first result and just stop?

724
00:35:58,331 --> 00:35:58,613
Speaker 0: Yeah.

725
00:35:58,714 --> 00:36:00,730
Speaker 0: What if it's a different edition of the book or the page numbers?

726
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:01,234
Speaker 0: They're different.

727
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,090
Speaker 1: See, this is why an index is good.

728
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:09,536
Speaker 1: An index, you just go to the index and it's really easy to look through an index because you go right to T and you go to S. You're only looking at.

729
00:36:09,638 --> 00:36:10,649
Speaker 1: you don't need to look at the whole index.

730
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:14,030
Speaker 1: You just go to T and S and look for something about step and something about trackless.

731
00:36:14,413 --> 00:36:15,830
Speaker 1: And like, boom, they'll be page numbers.

732
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:16,396
Speaker 1: Good to go.

733
00:36:16,437 --> 00:36:16,742
Speaker 1: Done.

734
00:36:17,007 --> 00:36:17,170
Speaker 0: Yep.

735
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:17,973
Speaker 0: Now, what does that do?

736
00:36:18,033 --> 00:36:19,860
Speaker 0: It's basically saying here are.

737
00:36:20,101 --> 00:36:23,133
Speaker 0: here's a list of for one set of data.

738
00:36:23,537 --> 00:36:24,829
Speaker 0: What you might want to search for.

739
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:31,089
Speaker 0: Ideally, it should be a complete list, meaning everything in this category you could search for will be here.

740
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:31,651
Speaker 0: Yep.

741
00:36:31,671 --> 00:36:38,112
Speaker 0: I mean, the index of the Prince of Nothing is not going to index than of for things like that.

742
00:36:38,293 --> 00:36:42,792
Speaker 0: Simple words is only going to index probably proper nouns or nouns that are significant.

743
00:36:43,394 --> 00:36:57,069
Speaker 0: So already I couldn't for example, I couldn't ask it which chapters have long sentences or I definitely couldn't use the index to find out how many times is the word step mentioned in the entire book period by word.

744
00:36:57,471 --> 00:36:57,672
Speaker 0: Right.

745
00:36:57,953 --> 00:37:03,329
Speaker 0: I'd have to use the index to find the pages and then I'd have to scan the pages to count how many times the word appears.

746
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:03,831
Speaker 1: Right.

747
00:37:03,851 --> 00:37:11,270
Speaker 1: So there are many, many things you can, you know, just available open source and closed source technologies that basically do all this indexing work for you.

748
00:37:11,331 --> 00:37:12,910
Speaker 1: So you don't have to do most of it.

749
00:37:13,012 --> 00:37:13,155
Speaker 0: Right.

750
00:37:13,176 --> 00:37:13,689
Speaker 0: Like Lucene.

751
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,607
Speaker 1: Lucene, Sphinx, Solr.

752
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:19,530
Speaker 1: Well, Lucene is actually, I think, like an interface that is used by a lot of these.

753
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:21,209
Speaker 1: So it's like a lot of them speak Lucene.

754
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:23,190
Speaker 1: Solr is one of the things that speaks Lucene.

755
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:28,693
Speaker 1: But anyway, so let's say, you know, you've got a blog or something with a billion articles on it.

756
00:37:28,754 --> 00:37:30,449
Speaker 1: It's the most craziest blog ever.

757
00:37:30,734 --> 00:37:31,609
Speaker 1: It's got a million articles.

758
00:37:32,451 --> 00:37:43,490
Speaker 1: So you have this indexing server, say Solr and Solr will, according to your instructions, it automatically at some period of time index all the blog posts.

759
00:37:43,631 --> 00:37:45,930
Speaker 1: And then when there's new blog posts, it'll add them to the index.

760
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:51,530
Speaker 1: And it basically completely separate from the database that contains the blog post in some file somewhere.

761
00:37:52,014 --> 00:37:53,529
Speaker 1: It will maintain this index.

762
00:37:54,031 --> 00:38:00,289
Speaker 1: And then if anyone wants to search, you don't ask the database, you ask Solr and you say, hey, Solr, search for this.

763
00:38:00,451 --> 00:38:02,210
Speaker 1: And it'll go and be like, here's a blog post.

764
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:03,430
Speaker 1: Here's the second best blog post.

765
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:07,390
Speaker 1: His third best blog post, according to the instructions you give it for searching.

766
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:07,851
Speaker 1: Yeah.

767
00:38:08,293 --> 00:38:21,910
Speaker 1: See, while it does the work for you of indexing and searching, you still have to sort of tell it how to index and what to index and how to rank the searches and such, which is still kind of hard, but not as hard as if you had to write it yourself.

768
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:22,290
Speaker 0: Yep.

769
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:29,390
Speaker 0: Now, performance can be an issue, so you might have to go one step further and have multiple index indices of different types of data.

770
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:29,713
Speaker 1: Yep.

771
00:38:29,997 --> 00:38:30,709
Speaker 1: Index to index.

772
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:31,111
Speaker 1: Right.

773
00:38:31,131 --> 00:38:39,714
Speaker 1: But if you got blog posts, but you also got photo galleries and you also got videos and you also got video games and you got to make separate indexes for separate types of things.

774
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:41,249
Speaker 0: Now you can go crazy, too.

775
00:38:41,431 --> 00:38:42,970
Speaker 0: And what if there are things you would calculate?

776
00:38:43,391 --> 00:38:57,330
Speaker 0: So maybe what you do is you calculate lots of crazy searches that people are likely to do and have indices of those where you have an index that just indexes search queries, individual queries.

777
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:07,330
Speaker 1: So the first thing you do when someone types in a search is to search for that search or a superset of that search to see if it is a search someone makes often.

778
00:39:07,571 --> 00:39:09,370
Speaker 1: And if so, you already know the answer.

779
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:09,694
Speaker 1: Boom.

780
00:39:09,735 --> 00:39:10,123
Speaker 1: Here it is.

781
00:39:10,911 --> 00:39:18,728
Speaker 1: Otherwise, figure out which index to search and search that index and maybe save the result in the fast search index.

782
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:27,869
Speaker 0: Now, in terms of the go zooming all the way back into you, the lowly individual human being, most of you don't need to know a lot about this.

783
00:39:28,251 --> 00:39:30,109
Speaker 1: You do if you ever want to make something searchable.

784
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:39,691
Speaker 0: This is the realm of programmers, the realm of designers like technical designers, the realm of enterprise software and Internet stuff, not really the realm of the individual dude.

785
00:39:39,751 --> 00:39:46,749
Speaker 0: But at the same time, what if you want to count how many times the word foo appears in a giant website?

786
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:51,896
Speaker 0: Do you need to know how to use regular expressions, which are basically a way of streaming text through?

787
00:39:51,916 --> 00:39:54,250
Speaker 1: regular expression is a bad way of looking at HTML.

788
00:39:54,772 --> 00:39:55,234
Speaker 0: It is.

789
00:39:55,375 --> 00:39:58,390
Speaker 1: But I guess you get the job done with it.

790
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:58,891
Speaker 1: Maybe.

791
00:39:59,112 --> 00:39:59,333
Speaker 0: Yeah.

792
00:39:59,574 --> 00:40:03,430
Speaker 0: Well, maybe you're just looking for all the lines where the word foo appears.

793
00:40:03,631 --> 00:40:03,893
Speaker 1: Sure.

794
00:40:04,176 --> 00:40:05,550
Speaker 1: That's a good use of regular expression.

795
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:07,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's pretty much the best use of regular expression.

796
00:40:08,193 --> 00:40:09,630
Speaker 0: Show me all the lines where X appears.

797
00:40:10,252 --> 00:40:10,375
Speaker 1: Great.

798
00:40:10,663 --> 00:40:10,930
Speaker 1: Perfect.

799
00:40:14,294 --> 00:40:15,720
Speaker 0: So why are?

800
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,190
Speaker 0: is there competition in search engines today?

801
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,150
Speaker 1: Scott, why is there competition?

802
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:24,769
Speaker 1: Well, search engines, they all work in different ways, crooks, slightly so.

803
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:25,290
Speaker 1: Right.

804
00:40:25,813 --> 00:40:26,215
Speaker 1: Some of them.

805
00:40:26,295 --> 00:40:31,229
Speaker 0: while you talk, I'm going to do a search on Bing and Yahoo and Google for those search engines.

806
00:40:31,772 --> 00:40:36,010
Speaker 1: I thought you were talking about the search engines that you would use if you were going to make something searchable as a developer.

807
00:40:36,131 --> 00:40:36,332
Speaker 0: No.

808
00:40:36,472 --> 00:40:37,337
Speaker 0: All right.

809
00:40:37,357 --> 00:40:39,690
Speaker 1: Then why does competition mean Google, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo,

810
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:39,770
Speaker 1: etc.?

811
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:40,450
Speaker 1: ?

812
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:41,861
Speaker 0: Let's go with your tack first.

813
00:40:41,901 --> 00:40:43,170
Speaker 0: That's probably a more interesting tack.

814
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:43,711
Speaker 1: All right.

815
00:40:44,033 --> 00:40:46,930
Speaker 1: Well, the reason that it's like, why doesn't just everyone use Solr?

816
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:48,589
Speaker 1: Well, Solr is Java, right?

817
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:52,390
Speaker 1: So some people might be developing a system where Java is not good for them.

818
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,130
Speaker 1: So they need one that doesn't use Java.

819
00:40:54,271 --> 00:40:56,330
Speaker 1: But Solr is actually really good.

820
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:01,894
Speaker 1: So, you know, maybe if you're willing to use Java, then Solr is better than that other one that's not Java.

821
00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:10,890
Speaker 1: And also the different search platform technologies, you know, some of them are better or worse at different kinds of indexing.

822
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:17,890
Speaker 1: So depending on what kind of data you have or how high performance you need it to be, right, you might choose something different.

823
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:24,449
Speaker 1: Like in Python, you can use this thing called Woosh, which is not really the highest performance search that there is.

824
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:25,112
Speaker 1: But you know what?

825
00:41:25,474 --> 00:41:30,410
Speaker 1: It's really simple and easy to use and it gets the job done if your job isn't too fancy.

826
00:41:30,971 --> 00:41:33,830
Speaker 1: So if that's all you need, that's all you need.

827
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:42,070
Speaker 1: And you only go for the Solr if you really got, you know, some mega huge pile of data and you need a really good search and you've got the time to invest in setting it all up.

828
00:41:43,952 --> 00:41:48,080
Speaker 1: Why are the big searches that you want to know why there's still Google, Yahoo, Bing, et cetera?

829
00:41:48,183 --> 00:41:48,368
Speaker 0: Yeah.

830
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:55,328
Speaker 1: Well, obviously, you know, people don't want to just let someone have a novelty, even though they do and you can't beat them.

831
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:55,671
Speaker 0: Yeah.

832
00:41:55,832 --> 00:41:58,690
Speaker 0: But at the same time, it's hard to make money off of just searching.

833
00:41:59,931 --> 00:42:02,930
Speaker 1: Well, you don't make money from the searching, make money from the ads on the searching.

834
00:42:02,991 --> 00:42:03,928
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I don't see.

835
00:42:04,631 --> 00:42:05,354
Speaker 1: And yeah, me either.

836
00:42:05,816 --> 00:42:14,736
Speaker 1: But also, if you have just the fact the searches themselves, when someone types something into your search box, if you just record all that, that is valuable data.

837
00:42:14,777 --> 00:42:16,490
Speaker 1: Like what are people searching for right now?

838
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:18,089
Speaker 1: What searches are more popular than others?

839
00:42:18,451 --> 00:42:18,632
Speaker 1: Yeah.

840
00:42:18,652 --> 00:42:21,590
Speaker 1: And people want to collect that data because they can make money with it.

841
00:42:22,472 --> 00:42:29,890
Speaker 1: And so everyone wants you to use their search engine so that their search data is the most valuable and they can make money off of it more easily.

842
00:42:30,111 --> 00:42:34,713
Speaker 0: Now, the reality is, unlike the old days, it really doesn't matter which search engine you use.

843
00:42:34,733 --> 00:42:37,429
Speaker 0: You're going to mostly find the same usefulness of results.

844
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:40,330
Speaker 1: Even if you use Bing, you're going to find what you're looking for, probably.

845
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:48,430
Speaker 0: I mean, in the old days, like search engines that people would use on the Internet were shitty, had fundamentally different methodologies.

846
00:42:48,631 --> 00:42:49,829
Speaker 1: And they were all bad.

847
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:53,530
Speaker 0: Like Yahoo was just like a sort of human controlled index.

848
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:54,253
Speaker 1: It sucked.

849
00:42:54,434 --> 00:42:56,430
Speaker 0: They would just add like, this is a website about that.

850
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:58,109
Speaker 0: So if you search for that, it'll appear on this list.

851
00:42:58,432 --> 00:43:01,550
Speaker 0: So a lot of broken links because someone would add something and then it would disappear.

852
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:06,076
Speaker 1: Some people had to manually add and remove them, which meant you go to Yahoo, you look for video games.

853
00:43:06,136 --> 00:43:07,109
Speaker 1: Like, OK, I found some.

854
00:43:07,553 --> 00:43:09,070
Speaker 1: And you go to Yahoo and look for video games.

855
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,367
Speaker 1: It's the same ones that were there yesterday, the same like 30 links.

856
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:14,210
Speaker 1: And it's like, oh, well, I'm sure there's a new thing about video games.

857
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:15,349
Speaker 1: I'm not going to find it here.

858
00:43:15,931 --> 00:43:17,130
Speaker 0: Though I did notice something interesting.

859
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:20,450
Speaker 0: So I searched for Geek Nights on Google, Bing and Yahoo.

860
00:43:21,815 --> 00:43:21,935
Speaker 0: OK.

861
00:43:21,976 --> 00:43:24,650
Speaker 0: Yahoo and Bing, we're number one, obviously.

862
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:27,950
Speaker 0: Number two is that Oxford Geek Nights that I see every now and then.

863
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:28,774
Speaker 1: Yeah, I see them.

864
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:31,430
Speaker 0: That doesn't show up even on the first fucking page of Google.

865
00:43:32,412 --> 00:43:33,259
Speaker 0: Like that's not there.

866
00:43:33,279 --> 00:43:34,590
Speaker 0: Oh, it's way down to the bottom.

867
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:35,750
Speaker 0: No, that's a different Geek Nights.

868
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:38,289
Speaker 0: That's Cheltenham Geek Nights.

869
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:49,030
Speaker 0: OK, so Google, basically, for whatever reason, those Oxford Geek Nights, whatever they are, have no Google juice, but have plenty of Bing juice and Yahoo juice.

870
00:43:49,451 --> 00:43:50,461
Speaker 0: OK, it's interesting.

871
00:43:50,481 --> 00:43:51,289
Speaker 0: They show up as number two.

872
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:55,489
Speaker 0: Google splits out the subsections of our website at the top.

873
00:43:56,213 --> 00:43:59,889
Speaker 0: Bing does not, but it does that for that Oxford Geek Nights.

874
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:06,430
Speaker 0: And basically, Bing and Yahoo are pretty much the same in terms of search results.

875
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:11,570
Speaker 0: And Google's bring up a lot more things on Google about us, obviously.

876
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:12,589
Speaker 0: I guess that makes sense.

877
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:13,614
Speaker 1: Well, this has to do.

878
00:44:13,654 --> 00:44:16,830
Speaker 1: well, most of some of this has to do with the ranking method.

879
00:44:16,931 --> 00:44:17,212
Speaker 1: Right.

880
00:44:17,273 --> 00:44:20,110
Speaker 1: So someone searches for, I don't know, fire.

881
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:20,632
Speaker 1: Right.

882
00:44:20,873 --> 00:44:24,703
Speaker 1: And you search all your blog posts and you find all the blog posts with the word fire in them.

883
00:44:24,907 --> 00:44:25,070
Speaker 1: Right.

884
00:44:25,472 --> 00:44:28,530
Speaker 1: How do you decide which one's on top, which one's second, which one's third?

885
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:32,453
Speaker 1: How do you, maybe even though it has the word fire, maybe one of them isn't even worth showing.

886
00:44:32,654 --> 00:44:32,856
Speaker 1: Right.

887
00:44:33,278 --> 00:44:34,990
Speaker 1: How do you figure this out?

888
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:43,630
Speaker 1: How does a computer which can't read it and use its human judgment, right, to figure out which one is the most relevant, rank these appropriately?

889
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:45,650
Speaker 0: You need some sort of algorithm or heuristic.

890
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:50,850
Speaker 1: This is a very, very hard problem, which is why only Google has been able to solve it super well.

891
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:54,210
Speaker 0: Well, like in the old days, one way is they would just look at, well, I search for fire.

892
00:44:54,512 --> 00:44:57,130
Speaker 0: How many times does the word fire appear on each Web page?

893
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:01,273
Speaker 1: So then someone makes a Web page with the word fire on it hidden ten hundred thousand times.

894
00:45:01,374 --> 00:45:03,289
Speaker 0: Which people still stupidly do.

895
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:03,971
Speaker 1: Yep.

896
00:45:04,473 --> 00:45:08,715
Speaker 1: And then that one ends up first if you search for fire because it has the word fire ten billion times.

897
00:45:09,037 --> 00:45:13,430
Speaker 0: I mean, Google's sort of brilliance back in the day was that they looked at who else was linking to something.

898
00:45:13,672 --> 00:45:15,190
Speaker 0: And that was there like the initial seed of Google.

899
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:16,695
Speaker 1: That's still how Google mostly works.

900
00:45:16,796 --> 00:45:22,250
Speaker 1: is, OK, we don't care really, you know, well, we care somewhat what words are on your page.

901
00:45:22,391 --> 00:45:22,592
Speaker 1: Right.

902
00:45:22,633 --> 00:45:24,810
Speaker 1: But anyone can put any number of words in any page.

903
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:25,452
Speaker 1: We care.

904
00:45:25,854 --> 00:45:32,490
Speaker 1: Someone else wrote a blog post that contains these words and then they link to you and the link that is to you contains these words.

905
00:45:33,191 --> 00:45:39,130
Speaker 1: So that means that a search for those words is your page is probably a good result.

906
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:39,593
Speaker 1: And you know what?

907
00:45:39,613 --> 00:45:42,410
Speaker 1: There's like a thousand pages on the Internet that aren't yours.

908
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:46,190
Speaker 1: There are other people's posts and tweets and blog posts and whatnot.

909
00:45:46,511 --> 00:45:53,156
Speaker 1: They're all pointing to your one blog article on your site, all using similar words because you wrote about fire.

910
00:45:53,277 --> 00:45:56,872
Speaker 1: So they're like, check out this article about fire link to Scott.

911
00:45:57,294 --> 00:45:57,535
Speaker 1: Right.

912
00:45:57,596 --> 00:46:00,330
Speaker 1: The word fire links to Scott's article about fire and so on.

913
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:10,497
Speaker 1: So that probably suggests that someone who's looking for fire link and Scott, that blog post Scott wrote is probably something good that people are interested in because somebody will link to it.

914
00:46:10,558 --> 00:46:11,469
Speaker 1: And it turns out that's true.

915
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:17,670
Speaker 0: But then people would spam links on forums to brought that up illicitly.

916
00:46:18,971 --> 00:46:25,830
Speaker 0: And then you could do something clever like if you get if you see links from a bad source, then it's probably a bad site.

917
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:26,331
Speaker 1: Oh, good.

918
00:46:26,371 --> 00:46:29,970
Speaker 1: They don't make a bad site on purpose and link to my competitors from it.

919
00:46:30,551 --> 00:46:34,530
Speaker 0: Oh, so now you've got to figure out if it's a legit bad site or a malicious bad site.

920
00:46:34,852 --> 00:46:36,270
Speaker 0: You can see it gets really complicated.

921
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:38,910
Speaker 1: This shit is not hard to figure out.

922
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:41,630
Speaker 1: Also, what about things like spelling errors?

923
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:43,269
Speaker 1: Google seems to have figured that out.

924
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:45,269
Speaker 1: Other people only slightly.

925
00:46:45,591 --> 00:46:45,892
Speaker 0: Right up.

926
00:46:47,176 --> 00:46:58,330
Speaker 1: You've also got issues such as like, all right, what if I make a new movie and the title of the movie is the or no, it's actually the the the the the right.

927
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:01,069
Speaker 0: Well, that'd be easy because the the does not often appear.

928
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:03,902
Speaker 1: No, I would be way harder by the title of the movie.

929
00:47:03,982 --> 00:47:06,689
Speaker 0: is the because I can search for the the in quotes.

930
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:14,790
Speaker 0: Someone goes to your Google and searches for the guys in English musical and multimedia group that's been active in various forms since nineteen seventy nine.

931
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:15,173
Speaker 0: Wow.

932
00:47:15,194 --> 00:47:15,727
Speaker 0: Video page.

933
00:47:16,376 --> 00:47:17,610
Speaker 0: OK, there was David Bowie.

934
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:22,190
Speaker 1: What you type in the on Google, are you going to the first result?

935
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:31,410
Speaker 1: Should it be a dictionary entry for the word the a Wikipedia page for the word the the movie which has a title of the right?

936
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:33,970
Speaker 0: You want to know what the results are on Google?

937
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:37,249
Speaker 0: One definition of the word the to the onion.

938
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:39,134
Speaker 1: The onion.

939
00:47:39,215 --> 00:47:41,229
Speaker 1: Yes, it's the the onion.

940
00:47:41,591 --> 00:47:44,790
Speaker 0: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Economist, The High Line.

941
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:45,711
Speaker 1: There you go.

942
00:47:45,892 --> 00:47:51,052
Speaker 1: Now, those results are obviously based on Rims Google account that is signed in.

943
00:47:51,233 --> 00:47:55,390
Speaker 1: Yes, because signed out the results would most likely change.

944
00:47:55,671 --> 00:47:55,852
Speaker 0: Yep.

945
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,969
Speaker 1: So let me open up a private browsing window.

946
00:47:58,410 --> 00:47:59,201
Speaker 1: Control shift in.

947
00:47:59,222 --> 00:47:59,282
Speaker 1: Wow.

948
00:48:00,411 --> 00:48:01,415
Speaker 0: You do that often.

949
00:48:02,339 --> 00:48:03,082
Speaker 1: I know how to get.

950
00:48:03,102 --> 00:48:04,829
Speaker 1: I have to visit sites with no cash and shit.

951
00:48:05,312 --> 00:48:05,597
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

952
00:48:05,618 --> 00:48:06,289
Speaker 0: I guess that is your job.

953
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:07,074
Speaker 1: Also porn.

954
00:48:08,243 --> 00:48:09,090
Speaker 0: That's what I was getting at.

955
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:09,533
Speaker 0: That was my.

956
00:48:09,734 --> 00:48:11,628
Speaker 0: that was the implication to be more funny.

957
00:48:12,635 --> 00:48:14,089
Speaker 1: I guess why we're doing this.

958
00:48:15,231 --> 00:48:18,830
Speaker 1: OK, just type in the the dictionary.

959
00:48:20,733 --> 00:48:21,523
Speaker 0: Similar results.

960
00:48:21,584 --> 00:48:22,009
Speaker 1: Really?

961
00:48:22,671 --> 00:48:23,543
Speaker 1: Very interesting.

962
00:48:23,564 --> 00:48:23,909
Speaker 1: Wow.

963
00:48:24,172 --> 00:48:25,242
Speaker 0: It's almost the same results.

964
00:48:25,424 --> 00:48:25,909
Speaker 1: How about that?

965
00:48:26,351 --> 00:48:28,689
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is definitely still being seeded from me.

966
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:30,922
Speaker 1: The Frick Collection, Twitter dot com slash the.

967
00:48:30,982 --> 00:48:32,230
Speaker 1: how about who's got that account?

968
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:36,290
Speaker 0: The Atlantic, the Metropolitan Museum of the Onion is basically the same results.

969
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:38,210
Speaker 0: That's fascinating.

970
00:48:38,351 --> 00:48:41,210
Speaker 0: That means that Google is doing more than just looking at my account.

971
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:48,388
Speaker 1: They're looking at some combination of IP or browser or those are actually just the top results for the might be.

972
00:48:48,772 --> 00:48:51,110
Speaker 0: Let's try Internet Explorer.

973
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:54,149
Speaker 0: That's never been logged into any of my Google accounts.

974
00:48:54,832 --> 00:48:56,129
Speaker 1: You're probably going to get the same results.

975
00:48:58,383 --> 00:48:58,670
Speaker 0: The what?

976
00:48:59,112 --> 00:49:00,230
Speaker 0: No, don't want to install.

977
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,728
Speaker 0: I guess I never run this in a long time.

978
00:49:03,095 --> 00:49:03,156
Speaker 0: The.

979
00:49:03,665 --> 00:49:03,910
Speaker 0: All right.

980
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:05,890
Speaker 0: It's being in the Weather Channel.

981
00:49:05,991 --> 00:49:06,496
Speaker 0: Number one.

982
00:49:06,839 --> 00:49:08,050
Speaker 1: Really, the dictionary.

983
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:08,819
Speaker 1: Number two.

984
00:49:09,002 --> 00:49:09,328
Speaker 0: Yeah.

985
00:49:09,891 --> 00:49:10,136
Speaker 1: Wow.

986
00:49:10,401 --> 00:49:10,809
Speaker 1: Yeah.

987
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:13,249
Speaker 1: Three, the the the dot com.

988
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:13,933
Speaker 0: Yep.

989
00:49:15,522 --> 00:49:16,487
Speaker 0: The Onion is there.

990
00:49:18,472 --> 00:49:20,702
Speaker 1: I guess, you know, you can also write.

991
00:49:20,823 --> 00:49:25,910
Speaker 1: it's like if you are a search engine and you have enough people using you, you know what the most common searches are.

992
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:33,550
Speaker 1: So, you know, like, hey, most people, when they typed in the word the and I showed them results, most people ended up clicking on this link.

993
00:49:34,092 --> 00:49:38,273
Speaker 1: So that link is probably what the people were actually looking for when they typed in the.

994
00:49:38,858 --> 00:49:39,828
Speaker 1: So I'm going to move that one up.

995
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:44,666
Speaker 0: So if you have some fun in Google, just start typing like why is?

996
00:49:44,807 --> 00:49:47,930
Speaker 0: and type a couple of things and see what Google recommends.

997
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:49,093
Speaker 1: The sky blue.

998
00:49:49,474 --> 00:49:52,970
Speaker 0: Why is Scott not counting, not on counting cars?

999
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:53,836
Speaker 1: What the hell is counting?

1000
00:49:53,856 --> 00:49:55,269
Speaker 0: holding Chloe's hand?

1001
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:58,348
Speaker 0: Disick called the Lord.

1002
00:49:59,591 --> 00:49:59,872
Speaker 1: All right.

1003
00:50:00,053 --> 00:50:03,933
Speaker 1: Apparently, no, I think it's a person who's named Scott Disick, and I don't know who that is.

1004
00:50:03,953 --> 00:50:07,150
Speaker 1: And I think if we look, we're going to go down became British royalty.

1005
00:50:07,912 --> 00:50:08,647
Speaker 0: OK, OK.

1006
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:09,840
Speaker 0: It's Wikipedia article.

1007
00:50:10,082 --> 00:50:10,608
Speaker 0: He was on TV.

1008
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:12,416
Speaker 1: All right.

1009
00:50:12,539 --> 00:50:13,030
Speaker 1: Is he a lord?

1010
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:14,081
Speaker 1: I guess he's a lord.

1011
00:50:14,122 --> 00:50:14,569
Speaker 0: He's a lord.

1012
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:15,416
Speaker 1: Lord Disick.

1013
00:50:16,488 --> 00:50:16,650
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1014
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:17,640
Speaker 0: Television personality.

1015
00:50:17,661 --> 00:50:18,410
Speaker 1: I want to be a lord.

1016
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:19,095
Speaker 0: You want to?

1017
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,066
Speaker 1: Why wouldn't you?

1018
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:26,110
Speaker 1: Lord Reuben, get out of my head, hold your cupped hand.

1019
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:27,066
Speaker 1: So I may be into that.

1020
00:50:29,312 --> 00:50:30,503
Speaker 0: I think we're running out of steam here.

1021
00:50:30,543 --> 00:50:31,249
Speaker 0: I think this is over.

1022
00:50:31,632 --> 00:50:31,874
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1023
00:50:32,216 --> 00:50:32,418
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1024
00:50:32,458 --> 00:50:34,090
Speaker 0: Let us know if we did a show on this or not.

1025
00:50:35,752 --> 00:50:37,770
Speaker 0: And we'll see if we bothered changing anything.

1026
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:41,390
Speaker 0: I got to see why we didn't find dentists from dentistry and vice versa.

1027
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:41,990
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1028
00:50:46,597 --> 00:50:48,720
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1029
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:54,043

Speaker 1: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1036
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:24,837
Speaker 1: War goes on just like before.

1037
00:52:24,898 --> 00:52:28,063
Speaker 1: War goes on, it never ends.

1038
00:52:28,083 --> 00:52:31,509
Speaker 1: War creates bigger dividends.

1039
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:39,679
Speaker 1: Brave new world is born to die.

1040
00:52:40,361 --> 00:52:47,809
Speaker 0: From total damage to damage, limitation fears the key to defend the nation.

1041
00:52:52,752 --> 00:53:04,450
Speaker 1: There is no need for politics, seeing life with unseen eyes, seeing men see through the disguise.
