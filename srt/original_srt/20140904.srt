1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,791
Speaker 1: It's Thursday September 4th 2014.

2
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:17,142
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Judith and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:17,524 --> 00:00:19,390
Speaker 1: Judith is on the spot.

4
00:00:20,892 --> 00:00:23,800
Speaker 1: This is the part where I usually talk way too long and Scott gets really mad.

5
00:00:25,773 --> 00:00:26,807
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,092 --> 00:00:36,889
Speaker 1: So, uh Scott apparently and I shit you not Forgot to come over to the studio to do the show.

7
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:38,655
Speaker 1: He was.

8
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:40,630
Speaker 1: we were talking about it right before I was at work.

9
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,355
Speaker 1: I was like, hey, we're gonna do a show and he was like, oh, yeah We'll do the show on this.

10
00:00:44,657 --> 00:00:46,810
Speaker 1: and I was like we're gonna get Judith on and put her on the spot.

11
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:47,737
Speaker 1: It's gonna be hilarious.

12
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:49,189
Speaker 1: And he was like, yeah, that'll be pretty good.

13
00:00:49,511 --> 00:00:52,385
Speaker 1: And if she doesn't show up, we'll just talk about gamer gate because that's pretty stupid.

14
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:53,430
Speaker 1: and I'm like, yeah.

15
00:00:53,935 --> 00:00:57,776
Speaker 1: and then Scott didn't come home and After like an hour and a half.

16
00:00:57,877 --> 00:01:00,669
Speaker 1: I've wondered if he was dead, you know bike accident or whatever.

17
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:06,350
Speaker 1: So I messaged him and the response I get was basically I'm gonna read his exact response.

18
00:01:06,711 --> 00:01:08,781
Speaker 1: Also Judith, you can say something at any time.

19
00:01:08,841 --> 00:01:10,750
Speaker 0: You were planning to put me on the spot the whole time.

20
00:01:11,051 --> 00:01:14,632
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was waiting for you to say something and yes I was planning.

21
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,700
Speaker 1: I decided to call this Judith on the spot.

22
00:01:17,042 --> 00:01:19,070
Speaker 1: the second you asked if you could come over and watch us.

23
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,159
Speaker 1: do geek nights class.

24
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,517
Speaker 1: I Am nothing but class.

25
00:01:22,839 --> 00:01:24,529
Speaker 1: All right, let's see.

26
00:01:25,357 --> 00:01:29,021
Speaker 1: so Are you dead or just not coming over?

27
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:31,210
Speaker 1: emoticon of a B is what I sent to Scott?

28
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,815
Speaker 1: law he paused.

29
00:01:32,835 --> 00:01:35,128
Speaker 1: there's like five minutes of no response followed by.

30
00:01:35,148 --> 00:01:41,082
Speaker 1: Oh I Just forgot there was a show and went home.

31
00:01:41,343 --> 00:01:43,410
Speaker 0: Does he usually reply to you within a few seconds?

32
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:44,978
Speaker 0: Is it weird to have a five-minute pause?

33
00:01:44,998 --> 00:01:45,863
Speaker 1: It's weird to have a pause.

34
00:01:45,903 --> 00:01:47,090
Speaker 1: That's why I wondered if he was dead.

35
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:48,114
Speaker 0: Oh, that's so cute.

36
00:01:48,215 --> 00:01:55,050
Speaker 1: So I said lol a whole bunch of times and he's like, so, uh, yeah I guess forgetting once in this many years is actually pretty good.

37
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:58,114
Speaker 1: So yeah, Scott's not dead.

38
00:01:58,435 --> 00:02:00,181
Speaker 1: he's just bad at remembering things.

39
00:02:00,201 --> 00:02:03,250
Speaker 1: so I guess he's just stop going senile early.

40
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,549
Speaker 0: It's going on his permanent record.

41
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:13,832
Speaker 1: So instead what I'm doing here is I'm putting Judith on the spot because we've changed the production process of geek nights a lot over The years.

42
00:02:14,153 --> 00:02:18,090
Speaker 1: the last time we did a show on this we talked about how we had this like fucking compressor in line.

43
00:02:18,451 --> 00:02:28,217
Speaker 1: we had all this analog mixer stuff and we really don't do any of that anymore and none of you guys seem to know how we do the show and Judith wants to do a podcast.

44
00:02:28,257 --> 00:02:29,884
Speaker 1: now the whole internet knows she wants to do a podcast.

45
00:02:29,925 --> 00:02:33,621
Speaker 1: if she doesn't do a podcast People are gonna be like, hey, where's my podcast?

46
00:02:33,701 --> 00:02:35,709
Speaker 0: except the whole internet doesn't know who I am.

47
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:37,458
Speaker 1: I think some people know who you are.

48
00:02:37,478 --> 00:02:39,146
Speaker 1: Do you want them to know who you are?

49
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:39,870
Speaker 1: You're just gonna be Judith.

50
00:02:40,433 --> 00:02:41,156
Speaker 0: I'll just be Judith.

51
00:02:41,478 --> 00:02:43,790
Speaker 1: Can do you want me to link to anything in the in the show notes?

52
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:44,873
Speaker 1: I don't know.

53
00:02:45,194 --> 00:02:48,307
Speaker 0: so okay, you can give him my Twitter cuz I don't have much else at the moment.

54
00:02:48,508 --> 00:02:49,010
Speaker 0: Oh Twitter.

55
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:57,090
Speaker 1: So in the old days show notes were called schnoz by horrifying people who luckily no longer podcast.

56
00:02:57,992 --> 00:02:58,817
Speaker 1: So bear that in mind.

57
00:02:58,837 --> 00:02:59,844
Speaker 1: It's a terrible word.

58
00:02:59,864 --> 00:03:00,810
Speaker 1: It is a terrible word.

59
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:05,630
Speaker 1: You know what a lot of people we used to podcast with hated us because we thought podcasting was stupid.

60
00:03:06,572 --> 00:03:07,276
Speaker 0: And why did you do it?

61
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,542
Speaker 1: because it's really stupid.

62
00:03:09,045 --> 00:03:17,610
Speaker 1: All right, okay we're into this but a lot of people tried to make money off of podcasting and There was like this whole cottage interest.

63
00:03:17,691 --> 00:03:33,735
Speaker 1: There's a point where a radio producer invited us and Emily came with us to come to the radio station in New York and then Scott and I explained to this celebrity and all these people like what podcasting is and how to do it and We started to build a professional relationship.

64
00:03:34,357 --> 00:03:40,562
Speaker 1: and then podcasting died and that person left New York and radio died and podcasting died again.

65
00:03:40,582 --> 00:03:45,522
Speaker 1: in fact There used to be awards and we won one of them.

66
00:03:45,562 --> 00:03:47,130
Speaker 1: We're the best anime podcast.

67
00:03:48,132 --> 00:03:48,855
Speaker 0: Who gave you that?

68
00:03:49,116 --> 00:03:50,663
Speaker 1: This is the parsec Awards.

69
00:03:50,723 --> 00:03:56,510
Speaker 0: These are awards for like Exemplary short fiction that looks like something from a garage sale.

70
00:03:57,431 --> 00:04:08,826
Speaker 1: In fact, this is why a lot of people hated us because we won this the first one ever and we didn't even fucking go to the award ceremony and Everyone else who was nominated did so.

71
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:10,875
Speaker 1: they announced us We weren't there.

72
00:04:10,895 --> 00:04:15,292
Speaker 1: a friend of ours went up to the stage was like, yeah, I'll just take that for them I know them.

73
00:04:15,754 --> 00:04:20,649
Speaker 1: and then we didn't even like announce that we won it once we found out that is ultra typical for you.

74
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:21,452
Speaker 1: Well, it is.

75
00:04:21,473 --> 00:04:25,509
Speaker 1: and then we got nominated again the next year and we didn't even fill out the form we had to fill out.

76
00:04:27,651 --> 00:04:37,901
Speaker 1: So lesson one Learn how to do patter and how to constantly talk and generate content because dead air sucks But the only thing that sucks more than dead air is editing.

77
00:04:37,921 --> 00:04:40,905
Speaker 0: I Did that on purpose just now?

78
00:04:43,192 --> 00:04:55,510
Speaker 1: And point number two because if you're gonna do this podcast with another person the way Scott and I have been able to do this and panels so easily is Honestly that we never have ever looked at each other while we were doing the show.

79
00:04:56,591 --> 00:05:00,945
Speaker 1: We face away from each other so that when we're in a panel, we don't have to look at each other.

80
00:05:00,985 --> 00:05:03,736
Speaker 1: We can take completely Psychic cues.

81
00:05:04,398 --> 00:05:05,202
Speaker 0: you guys just do that.

82
00:05:05,282 --> 00:05:11,850
Speaker 1: Anyway, though, even when you're just talking Yeah, but it was fostered over a long time and we kind of refined it by doing the show this way.

83
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,509
Speaker 0: Okay, I always assumed that's just how you met looking away from each other.

84
00:05:17,493 --> 00:05:18,602
Speaker 0: What could be wrong with this guy?

85
00:05:18,763 --> 00:05:19,469
Speaker 0: Let's room together.

86
00:05:20,991 --> 00:05:24,285
Speaker 1: Actually, the story was we wanted to get a four-person apartment.

87
00:05:24,486 --> 00:05:25,310
Speaker 1: the last one ended.

88
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:31,183
Speaker 1: We thought we were gonna live in River Hole with all the rats and as we're walking Dejectedly over there to sign up for the non internet apartment.

89
00:05:31,484 --> 00:05:51,778
Speaker 1: They announced that there were two one-bedroom two-person apartments available in colony and We said yes and we start to run over and Greg holds up his hand and says wait and he turns around and he looks at all of us and he says and I quote who is going to live with Scott and There was a long pause and I said I will.

90
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:53,223
Speaker 0: of course you did.

91
00:05:53,243 --> 00:05:57,277
Speaker 1: of course I did masochist and then Great Scott is a great guy.

92
00:05:57,297 --> 00:05:58,644
Speaker 1: I remember how you guys met.

93
00:05:58,664 --> 00:06:01,041
Speaker 0: I Kind of yeah, we were at a wedding.

94
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:04,346
Speaker 1: Uh Was it the wedding or was it that Otacon or was it both?

95
00:06:04,386 --> 00:06:04,970
Speaker 0: It was the wedding.

96
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,653
Speaker 0: It was the wedding.

97
00:06:05,954 --> 00:06:09,669
Speaker 0: I might have been at the same Otacon as you but I didn't take any note of you.

98
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:12,137
Speaker 0: That's how I am with strangers.

99
00:06:12,278 --> 00:06:15,015
Speaker 1: I Must have been quiet.

100
00:06:15,035 --> 00:06:16,142
Speaker 1: maybe I hurt my throat or something.

101
00:06:16,565 --> 00:06:17,250
Speaker 0: I can't even imagine.

102
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:23,563
Speaker 1: So, uh, it's Thursday, it's the lounge and you're not.

103
00:06:23,624 --> 00:06:27,178
Speaker 1: Scott usually gets mad when I call it the lounge But I can see why what we do.

104
00:06:27,198 --> 00:06:28,222
Speaker 1: Well, you don't like the lounge.

105
00:06:28,483 --> 00:06:30,290
Speaker 0: That's kind of corny as hell.

106
00:06:30,551 --> 00:06:41,670
Speaker 1: Well, the original concept was that instead of doing our normal format on Thursday We'd have a different format and just talk for like an hour with no Like boundaries or format or anything and we said we'd do it and then we never actually did it.

107
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:45,099
Speaker 0: Okay, then you couldn't come up with like a free for all.

108
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,227
Speaker 0: there's three for all Thursday.

109
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:47,830
Speaker 0: No, that doesn't work.

110
00:06:49,112 --> 00:06:51,609
Speaker 1: We should have called it three for all Thursday and still only had two people.

111
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:59,538
Speaker 0: So have your third be Moogy or Theo Away, they weren't born yet.

112
00:06:59,941 --> 00:07:00,969
Speaker 1: No, they were not even born.

113
00:07:01,513 --> 00:07:04,510
Speaker 1: The thing you have to think about too when doing a podcast is content is king.

114
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:18,199
Speaker 1: So in addition to being able to do the pattern to just talk and to not have to edit and to already know what you're gonna Say and talk about you have to decide day one if you're going to have a format or not And I suggest having a format.

115
00:07:18,902 --> 00:07:20,730
Speaker 1: So what are you doing your podcast on?

116
00:07:22,511 --> 00:07:24,762
Speaker 0: Just being thrown in here and not knowing what I'm saying?

117
00:07:24,803 --> 00:07:28,381
Speaker 1: pretty much yeah pretty much Yeah, is that way gonna be what your main show is?

118
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,150
Speaker 0: Is this you trying to teach me some kind of lesson?

119
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,021
Speaker 1: No, I'm just curious like what's your show gonna be about?

120
00:07:32,182 --> 00:07:39,349
Speaker 0: I'm not entirely sure yet Just like we're gonna do podcast Maybe some of the things that we've covered in panels because we've done a variety of panels at different cons so far.

121
00:07:39,814 --> 00:07:41,150
Speaker 1: So you're not gonna make a topical one.

122
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:44,490
Speaker 1: It's not gonna be like adventure time and every episode is about adventure time.

123
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,593
Speaker 0: I might do that only not so specific You got.

124
00:07:47,613 --> 00:07:51,404
Speaker 1: I think the format you guys want to use is the fast karate for the gentleman format.

125
00:07:51,685 --> 00:07:58,283
Speaker 1: go on their format is as such They start talking about how they're setting up the podcast like alright, dude.

126
00:07:58,685 --> 00:08:11,255
Speaker 1: I got the Skype going you ready and Then they talk about something for like 10 minutes, and then they talk about their topic which is either an anime they watched video game they played or 24.

127
00:08:11,255 --> 00:08:14,613
Speaker 0: we're probably gonna wind up doing shit like that minus the 24.

128
00:08:14,613 --> 00:08:17,041
Speaker 1: So maybe adventure time is your 24.

129
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,125
Speaker 0: it could be so.

130
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:22,383
Speaker 1: you do your normal thing once a week And then whenever there's a new adventure time you just talk about that.

131
00:08:22,443 --> 00:08:25,475
Speaker 1: instead until adventure time ends I wonder if it will end.

132
00:08:25,495 --> 00:08:26,739
Speaker 0: of course it'll end.

133
00:08:27,201 --> 00:08:28,706
Speaker 1: I wonder well it all things.

134
00:08:28,726 --> 00:08:37,650
Speaker 1: then I wonder if Imagine if they just keep letting Finn age and then 20 years from now He's just an adult and the show just keeps going and it's radically different.

135
00:08:37,831 --> 00:08:38,556
Speaker 0: I'd be okay with that.

136
00:08:38,596 --> 00:08:40,568
Speaker 0: even that would be better than what happened to spongebob.

137
00:08:41,851 --> 00:08:43,118
Speaker 1: Spongebob started bad.

138
00:08:43,722 --> 00:08:45,070
Speaker 0: No it was good for kids.

139
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,134
Speaker 0: I think back.

140
00:08:46,194 --> 00:08:46,756
Speaker 0: was it really?

141
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:47,599
Speaker 1: was it?

142
00:08:47,619 --> 00:08:47,940
Speaker 1: really?

143
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:50,590
Speaker 1: did that not foster a generation of kids who run around going?

144
00:08:52,172 --> 00:08:57,037
Speaker 0: it was plain and slim simple slapstick and now it's just stupid.

145
00:08:57,742 --> 00:09:03,983
Speaker 1: I much prefer the Vaguely horrifying slapstick of like a ren and Stimpy or Rocco's modern life.

146
00:09:04,445 --> 00:09:05,930
Speaker 0: Yes, those were far superior shows.

147
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:11,590
Speaker 0: There's still one episode of spongebob call an old one called band geeks that makes me laugh every time I watch it.

148
00:09:12,136 --> 00:09:16,920
Speaker 0: I still recommend that one But that could just be me could be.

149
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:18,950
Speaker 1: I've never seen it, but I do like some dumb things.

150
00:09:19,211 --> 00:09:21,018
Speaker 1: I can't really cast aspersions here.

151
00:09:21,219 --> 00:09:23,548
Speaker 0: I'm getting a look of approval from someone else in the room.

152
00:09:23,568 --> 00:09:25,044
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah We have a studio audience, too.

153
00:09:27,851 --> 00:09:32,463
Speaker 1: So the other important thing is are you gonna do this on a schedule or not?

154
00:09:32,824 --> 00:09:37,114
Speaker 0: I would prefer a schedule vastly because Neither of us works well without one.

155
00:09:37,555 --> 00:09:42,970
Speaker 1: So how rapidly do you want the show to go from horrible to listenable to good?

156
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,763
Speaker 1: um Cuz it's got to be horrible.

157
00:09:47,288 --> 00:09:53,090
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I know that I mean Scott and I recorded geek nights for a couple of months before we even put that shit on the Internet.

158
00:09:53,150 --> 00:10:02,890
Speaker 1: Let me tell you I listened to some of those episodes this prep for this But I pray to the gods that no one ever actually finds those though they are still on the Internet.

159
00:10:03,373 --> 00:10:05,629
Speaker 0: There's a reason I never went into your old archives and bothered.

160
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:11,270
Speaker 1: I Assumed the thing is our old archives start months after we actually started.

161
00:10:11,591 --> 00:10:17,482
Speaker 0: Oh, I thought I would just feel all this secondhand proxy embarrassment for you, too And I wouldn't be able to bear it now.

162
00:10:17,502 --> 00:10:19,959
Speaker 1: the old episodes were not great But they were at least listenable.

163
00:10:20,241 --> 00:10:28,395
Speaker 1: the beta episodes We're listened to by maybe five or six people and most of the feedback was really This is what you're doing.

164
00:10:28,957 --> 00:10:31,910
Speaker 1: This is this is what happens when you leave college.

165
00:10:32,572 --> 00:10:34,057
Speaker 0: That's kind of what I've been anticipating.

166
00:10:34,157 --> 00:10:39,953
Speaker 0: only when you leave college is replaced with when you turn 30.

167
00:10:39,953 --> 00:10:55,544
Speaker 1: You know, I was hanging out of packs with a bunch of cool people but we hung out with something who was someone who was cool, but in their early 20s and People who are in the early 20s look the same as us mostly But they exhibit an exuberance that I think has gone from my brittle old man bones.

168
00:10:56,668 --> 00:11:00,337
Speaker 0: I know that feeling a Little too well, yeah, we're old.

169
00:11:00,658 --> 00:11:02,343
Speaker 1: listen kids tone down the exuberance.

170
00:11:03,045 --> 00:11:03,486
Speaker 0: Stop it.

171
00:11:03,506 --> 00:11:04,770
Speaker 0: You're making us feel bad.

172
00:11:06,372 --> 00:11:07,158
Speaker 1: You make us feel bad.

173
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:13,270
Speaker 1: one because I go to bed while you're still Exuberating and two you fucking hit me in the face with your elbow when you're exuberating.

174
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:17,710
Speaker 0: Also, I enjoy going to bed while you're still exuberating and that makes me feel bad.

175
00:11:18,832 --> 00:11:19,842
Speaker 1: Poor Scott at PAX.

176
00:11:20,064 --> 00:11:23,379
Speaker 1: It was like 1045 and he were playing pen Dante.

177
00:11:23,439 --> 00:11:24,464
Speaker 1: He just lays down at the table.

178
00:11:24,504 --> 00:11:25,830
Speaker 1: He's like, I think I need to go to bed.

179
00:11:26,313 --> 00:11:27,059
Speaker 1: I think I'm fading.

180
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:27,583
Speaker 0: 1045 Jesus.

181
00:11:32,193 --> 00:11:34,829
Speaker 1: That was pretty much the reaction I was going for there, okay good.

182
00:11:35,451 --> 00:11:50,130
Speaker 1: so the way we got at least reasonably competent at this the less the listener will agree is that we set a schedule that was Way way more than we could possibly reasonably expect to achieve and we forced ourselves to do it no matter fucking what?

183
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:56,536
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've heard that four nights a week every week for Four and a half years.

184
00:11:57,058 --> 00:11:58,161
Speaker 0: That's pretty crazy.

185
00:11:58,783 --> 00:12:00,749
Speaker 1: And uh, you know what we did the show no matter what.

186
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:02,434
Speaker 1: there were nights Where I didn't sleep.

187
00:12:02,515 --> 00:12:05,425
Speaker 1: I stayed up all night editing and then we went to work the next day.

188
00:12:05,827 --> 00:12:06,951
Speaker 0: and that is how you not Suck.

189
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:08,275
Speaker 1: that is how you not suck.

190
00:12:08,455 --> 00:12:13,430
Speaker 1: pick your schedule never ever skip an episode for anything not even packs.

191
00:12:13,911 --> 00:12:15,416
Speaker 1: Well, if you're at a convention, that's fine.

192
00:12:15,576 --> 00:12:15,817
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

193
00:12:16,098 --> 00:12:16,318
Speaker 1: Yeah.

194
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:21,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay thing is conventions didn't get in our way too much because conventions We'd always leave on Thursday.

195
00:12:21,862 --> 00:12:22,507
Speaker 1: So we just time it.

196
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:30,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, we used to record ahead when we were gone for Otacon for the week we would record four fucking extra episodes.

197
00:12:30,331 --> 00:12:32,035
Speaker 0: The illusion is broken.

198
00:12:32,055 --> 00:12:34,040
Speaker 1: We would record so far ahead.

199
00:12:34,341 --> 00:12:35,424
Speaker 1: It was ridiculous.

200
00:12:35,784 --> 00:12:37,830
Speaker 0: so much for that actually recorded at night thing.

201
00:12:39,151 --> 00:12:41,239
Speaker 1: Well, we were to record at night just at night ahead.

202
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:41,942
Speaker 1: Okay.

203
00:12:42,163 --> 00:12:42,324
Speaker 1: Yeah.

204
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:42,705
Speaker 1: Yeah sure.

205
00:12:42,906 --> 00:12:43,468
Speaker 1: That's what we do.

206
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:44,253
Speaker 0: last time I was here.

207
00:12:44,294 --> 00:12:44,860
Speaker 0: It was daylight.

208
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,240
Speaker 1: Just want to say that It was daylight, but it was still like seven something o'clock.

209
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,023
Speaker 0: That's not night.

210
00:12:50,123 --> 00:12:51,067
Speaker 0: That's not evening.

211
00:12:51,107 --> 00:12:51,749
Speaker 0: It was evening.

212
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:52,835
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

213
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:53,479
Speaker 1: We're old now.

214
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,110
Speaker 1: night is when you feel night.

215
00:12:59,911 --> 00:13:02,404
Speaker 1: So, uh, do you have any news to bring to the table or are we doing the lounge?

216
00:13:02,464 --> 00:13:09,250
Speaker 1: the lounge we can talk about whatever But if we do the normal geek nights format, we each have to bring one item of interest to the table for discussion.

217
00:13:10,353 --> 00:13:11,749
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I've got some gay news.

218
00:13:12,531 --> 00:13:14,302
Speaker 0: Gay news sad gay news, but gay news.

219
00:13:14,442 --> 00:13:15,469
Speaker 1: Oh, there was some good news.

220
00:13:15,489 --> 00:13:17,800
Speaker 1: today I think two or three more states.

221
00:13:18,322 --> 00:13:20,010
Speaker 1: gay marriage got on overturned.

222
00:13:20,311 --> 00:13:22,818
Speaker 0: Well, I always I always preferred the bad news first.

223
00:13:22,858 --> 00:13:29,719
Speaker 0: cuz then I leave a feeling happier when I've gotten the good news Rules against gay marriage bans in two states.

224
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:36,764
Speaker 1: Yeah Louisiana sucks though, Louisiana quote the US appeals court issued a scathing unequivocal ruling.

225
00:13:36,784 --> 00:13:39,840
Speaker 1: yes Alright, so what Louisiana do to ruin all this?

226
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:57,047
Speaker 0: they upheld their their matter Meh, their marriage ban in their federal court with this chromogeny old judge who basically recycled every horrible thing that's ever been said about the gay quote-unquote lifestyle and Summed everything up by quoting the dissension from the Supreme Court's.

227
00:13:57,389 --> 00:14:00,839
Speaker 1: Wow That's like copying off of the dumb kid in class.

228
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:04,409
Speaker 0: Yes saying that was the precedent not the actual case, but the dissension.

229
00:14:05,493 --> 00:14:09,486
Speaker 0: He finished everything saying every other judge before me was wrong.

230
00:14:09,867 --> 00:14:14,494
Speaker 0: I am right gay people are like Polygamous or whatever.

231
00:14:14,574 --> 00:14:18,328
Speaker 1: the other thing I don't like is so maybe there's there's a couple ways to go.

232
00:14:18,428 --> 00:14:26,250
Speaker 1: maybe Somehow he is actually on the right side and he is trying to force the Supreme Court into the final corner.

233
00:14:26,892 --> 00:14:28,618
Speaker 1: There's a tiny possibility of that.

234
00:14:28,638 --> 00:14:31,990
Speaker 0: I sometimes worry about that because the Supreme Court is ultra fucked up right now.

235
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:36,930
Speaker 1: Maybe he wants to go down in history as the last judge to stand against this.

236
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:40,090
Speaker 0: Maybe he's old and shitty and from Louisiana.

237
00:14:42,571 --> 00:14:46,544
Speaker 1: But I repeat myself, ooh, I didn't get the dirty look I was expecting.

238
00:14:46,745 --> 00:14:48,370
Speaker 0: sorry, I wasn't looking at you not you.

239
00:14:50,453 --> 00:14:52,041
Speaker 1: No, I'm getting approval for the statement.

240
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:53,127
Speaker 1: I stand by it.

241
00:14:53,187 --> 00:14:56,422
Speaker 1: then So, yeah, I got some news.

242
00:14:56,765 --> 00:15:06,379
Speaker 1: apparently nerds in their basements tried to stage a gamer gate protest at PAX because as far as I can tell and it took me a While to figure out what gamer gate was.

243
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,350
Speaker 0: Did they try to state it from their basements?

244
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,170
Speaker 1: I think they did because there wasn't actually a protest.

245
00:15:12,072 --> 00:15:16,190
Speaker 1: I saw all these tweets and then this one guy posted is like there's gonna be a false flag.

246
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:36,987
Speaker 1: Zoe Quinn is gonna be at PAX and then she's gonna stage an assault in a hallway And then they're gonna set it up to where she's gonna come out on stage at the closing ceremonies and Gabe and Tycho are gonna agree with her and unify and say that gamer is now a bad word and they're gonna drop the names of prominent youtubers who were collaborating and blah blah blah blah blah.

247
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:43,770
Speaker 1: and I Think what's beautiful is that even reddit was like, yeah, that's a bit much and that shit got deleted.

248
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:48,361
Speaker 1: It's like when even reddit backs off from you, I think you got trouble.

249
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:53,840
Speaker 0: reddit is just swimming and swill though They don't get a pass for that.

250
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,530
Speaker 1: Yeah thing is reddit.

251
00:15:55,931 --> 00:15:56,513
Speaker 1: What does someone say?

252
00:15:56,574 --> 00:16:01,270
Speaker 1: reddit is like 4chan, but it doesn't realize it's the bad guy, of course not.

253
00:16:02,391 --> 00:16:07,690
Speaker 1: But at the same time, I'm a hundred percent advocate of free speech even really shitty speech.

254
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,823
Speaker 1: So I kind of am glad that reddit exists.

255
00:16:09,863 --> 00:16:19,570
Speaker 1: as horrifying as it is I am not in favor of some of the threats that they've supported Well supported or well like who which they the people in subreddits or reddit itself as an organization.

256
00:16:20,071 --> 00:16:30,290
Speaker 0: Well, I'm sure that some people who frequent reddit have taken have partaken in making those threads while people on subreddits Ah, the people who have used the seven train have then threatened people.

257
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,655
Speaker 0: That's not what I'm trying to say.

258
00:16:32,775 --> 00:16:33,076
Speaker 0: Okay.

259
00:16:33,216 --> 00:16:34,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't support the threat.

260
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,065
Speaker 1: Well, welcome to the lion's den.

261
00:16:36,105 --> 00:16:41,078
Speaker 0: Judith on the spot Beauty I'm gonna throw this iPhone at you.

262
00:16:41,098 --> 00:16:45,276
Speaker 0: I Know it's your iPhone.

263
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:46,242
Speaker 0: That's why it's okay.

264
00:16:46,262 --> 00:16:49,980
Speaker 1: Ah Remember they can't hear our studio audience.

265
00:16:50,502 --> 00:16:51,265
Speaker 0: I know they can't.

266
00:16:51,466 --> 00:16:52,490
Speaker 1: so you know how to use a microphone.

267
00:16:53,493 --> 00:16:54,285
Speaker 0: I'm talking into it.

268
00:16:54,428 --> 00:16:54,932
Speaker 1: Yep Do you know?

269
00:16:54,952 --> 00:16:55,616
Speaker 1: do you know why?

270
00:16:55,797 --> 00:16:58,070
Speaker 1: like why you have to point it directly at your face?

271
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,760
Speaker 0: Cuz it doesn't pick up all this other shit.

272
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,190
Speaker 0: cuz why would I want anyone want to hear that?

273
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,101
Speaker 1: Yeah, most of the microphones you use don't have that power.

274
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:06,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know that this is like a good microphone.

275
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:06,973
Speaker 1: It is a really good.

276
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:09,670
Speaker 1: Well, there are good microphones that also don't have that power.

277
00:17:10,351 --> 00:17:11,549
Speaker 0: Wouldn't everybody want that power?

278
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,310
Speaker 1: No, because that power causes other problems too.

279
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:20,869
Speaker 1: For example, it allows me to have the smooth radio voice and adds a ton of bass to my voice Which can be good or bad on the circumstances.

280
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:25,450
Speaker 1: It causes some other distortion and if I move my head around at all, I'll suddenly get really quiet.

281
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,529
Speaker 0: There's bass in your voice ever.

282
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:34,536
Speaker 1: If I do this there is Listeners out there can hear.

283
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,893
Speaker 1: the thing is when you have a microphone like this It will.

284
00:17:37,993 --> 00:17:40,182
Speaker 1: actually there's something called the proximity effect.

285
00:17:40,202 --> 00:17:42,290
Speaker 1: So the closer you get the deeper it gets.

286
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,173
Speaker 1: That's why Howard Stern.

287
00:17:43,193 --> 00:17:47,670
Speaker 1: So it sounds so much more amazing and manly on the radio than he ever has in real life.

288
00:17:47,771 --> 00:17:49,729
Speaker 0: I just listened to your dash con episode.

289
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,980
Speaker 1: No, yeah, cuz I'm not doing it all the way.

290
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,870
Speaker 1: I stay back to have a more naturalistic tone.

291
00:17:55,292 --> 00:18:00,312
Speaker 1: But if I eat this microphone, you'll see you have to do a whole show like that sometime, you know I've tried.

292
00:18:00,373 --> 00:18:03,470
Speaker 1: the problem is that if I get loud when I'm this close, I'll blow it out.

293
00:18:03,631 --> 00:18:06,690
Speaker 0: I'll be too loud and don't get loud and make Scott be the loud one.

294
00:18:07,091 --> 00:18:08,276
Speaker 1: So I did.

295
00:18:08,377 --> 00:18:16,075
Speaker 1: the problem is we yell you don't look at these waveforms You've got I know I've been watching them tiny little Judith tiny little Judith And I'm just fucking yelling into the microphone.

296
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:21,570
Speaker 1: In fact, I've got compressors like holding my voice back from its full fucking loudness here.

297
00:18:22,296 --> 00:18:22,660
Speaker 0: I'm sorry.

298
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:34,450
Speaker 1: It's my diminutive feminine And The compressor that is applied here because this is Scott's voice profile is just the patriarchy holding you back.

299
00:18:35,751 --> 00:18:36,636
Speaker 0: So that's what it looks like.

300
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:37,942
Speaker 1: That's what it looks like.

301
00:18:37,982 --> 00:18:39,549
Speaker 1: It's a dynamic processor right there.

302
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:41,160
Speaker 1: I wonder if I can show you.

303
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:42,470
Speaker 1: I can show you what it's doing.

304
00:18:43,572 --> 00:18:45,203
Speaker 1: So you kids at home won't be able to learn this.

305
00:18:45,243 --> 00:18:46,049
Speaker 1: but here's what's going on.

306
00:18:46,652 --> 00:18:49,001
Speaker 1: There is a path in our voices in it.

307
00:18:49,864 --> 00:18:55,370
Speaker 1: in the old days when we did geek nights It was actually way harder because we didn't have good multi-track editing software.

308
00:18:55,430 --> 00:19:00,050
Speaker 1: So we record like a stereo waveform and then I would manually like run all these filters and ran a script.

309
00:19:00,471 --> 00:19:07,570
Speaker 1: But you with the power of audition need to learn all this stuff works and basically make a filter that will work kind of live.

310
00:19:07,972 --> 00:19:11,290
Speaker 1: So you don't have to ever like after the show like listen to it and go.

311
00:19:11,492 --> 00:19:13,370
Speaker 1: Oh, maybe I should make that part louder that part quieter.

312
00:19:13,431 --> 00:19:15,070
Speaker 1: You have a thing that just does it all automatically.

313
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,761
Speaker 1: So you can do the same process that the Daily Show does.

314
00:19:18,263 --> 00:19:26,050
Speaker 1: Daily Show records live Mixings live and they go right quote to tape meaning what they recorded is pretty much as what goes on the air, right?

315
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:30,490
Speaker 0: Okay, so you can do the same thing with audio and you have one tailored to each of your voices exactly.

316
00:19:30,951 --> 00:19:37,050
Speaker 1: So basically each one of these tracks I can apply different effects to and effects generally take effect live.

317
00:19:37,151 --> 00:19:46,187
Speaker 1: So for example, if I click here These are the effects applied to my voice The top line is the actual volume of my voice just as I'm talking as it's recorded.

318
00:19:46,528 --> 00:19:48,466
Speaker 1: if it turns right here I got too loud and I clipped it.

319
00:19:51,032 --> 00:19:53,260
Speaker 1: I wasn't able to clip it because I set it up.

320
00:19:53,301 --> 00:19:53,963
Speaker 1: So awesomely.

321
00:19:54,224 --> 00:19:55,188
Speaker 0: Anyway, don't try again.

322
00:19:57,671 --> 00:19:59,578
Speaker 1: And down here is the end result.

323
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,024
Speaker 1: see how it's louder and more uniform.

324
00:20:01,044 --> 00:20:02,710
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm the filters make that happen.

325
00:20:03,071 --> 00:20:05,882
Speaker 1: So if someone's listening like that, you got that waveform there.

326
00:20:06,102 --> 00:20:06,745
Speaker 0: Yeah, I see it.

327
00:20:06,845 --> 00:20:08,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, it looks like vomit.

328
00:20:10,132 --> 00:20:13,210
Speaker 1: So the first thing I got going on here you want to learn about noise gates.

329
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:21,535
Speaker 1: So what this is doing is this it's a graph showing like as the volume increases by one decibel In the actual signal.

330
00:20:22,057 --> 00:20:24,586
Speaker 1: Well, how much will it increase in the output signal?

331
00:20:24,626 --> 00:20:25,850
Speaker 1: Like what's actually being recorded?

332
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:31,249
Speaker 1: So you see it's doing nothing up here, but down here it gets quieter faster as it gets quiet.

333
00:20:31,892 --> 00:20:34,690
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm that removes you in the background from my channel.

334
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:39,209
Speaker 1: Okay, so I won't pick up you in the background like making extra noise or whatever.

335
00:20:39,994 --> 00:20:45,110
Speaker 1: Like all this extra stuff is getting rid of like it also gets rid of like Little weird noises that I make with my mouth when I lean back.

336
00:20:46,272 --> 00:20:48,019
Speaker 0: Like that those are the worst noises.

337
00:20:48,662 --> 00:20:50,450
Speaker 1: stop and I like those noises.

338
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:58,875
Speaker 1: So the second filter that we got going on here which takes place after that That is called a compressor.

339
00:20:58,995 --> 00:21:05,876
Speaker 1: So above 20 decibels the louder I get if I get too louder The wave only gets one louder.

340
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:10,469
Speaker 1: So I'm basically cutting my volume down at half the rate from what it normally would get to.

341
00:21:11,952 --> 00:21:15,270
Speaker 1: In general compressors just even the sound out and make you sound awesome when in doubt.

342
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:23,358
Speaker 1: Compress more because while it'll sound maybe a little artificial and a little kind of radio II That's why radio sounds so consistent.

343
00:21:23,378 --> 00:21:25,206
Speaker 1: You just compress the ever-living fuck out of it.

344
00:21:25,287 --> 00:21:25,588
Speaker 1: Okay?

345
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,802
Speaker 1: And the other thing you need to use is mastering.

346
00:21:29,244 --> 00:21:30,230
Speaker 1: this will just make shit easy.

347
00:21:30,571 --> 00:21:37,940
Speaker 1: just drag this stuff around and listen to like a recording your voice and find the parts that are Loud or weird or like.

348
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,050
Speaker 1: there's probably one area of your voice that sounds annoying When you're listening to it Like you're listening to it in headphones.

349
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,010
Speaker 1: Find that part and get rid of it like here.

350
00:21:45,572 --> 00:21:48,282
Speaker 1: I raised that part because that's the one good part of my voice right there.

351
00:21:48,342 --> 00:21:48,744
Speaker 1: that little bit.

352
00:21:48,764 --> 00:21:53,480
Speaker 1: that little bit is good rim And that is a bit like bass at the top there.

353
00:21:53,821 --> 00:21:55,629
Speaker 0: Where's that whole missing singing range?

354
00:21:57,091 --> 00:21:57,514
Speaker 1: Well, I could.

355
00:21:57,594 --> 00:21:59,202
Speaker 1: I could you want to add autotune.

356
00:21:59,222 --> 00:22:05,290
Speaker 1: I Could auto tune this episode right the fuck now And actually make yourself sing a tune.

357
00:22:06,271 --> 00:22:07,937
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is it'll only get me close.

358
00:22:07,998 --> 00:22:09,504
Speaker 1: It'll get me out of the nearest note.

359
00:22:10,066 --> 00:22:11,150
Speaker 1: That might not work out so well.

360
00:22:11,374 --> 00:22:12,088
Speaker 0: Yeah, please don't try.

361
00:22:12,911 --> 00:22:13,052
Speaker 1: Yeah.

362
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:15,846
Speaker 1: in music theory class I sang in falsetto because there's only way I could hit notes.

363
00:22:16,288 --> 00:22:16,730
Speaker 0: you sang.

364
00:22:17,273 --> 00:22:17,756
Speaker 1: I had to.

365
00:22:17,776 --> 00:22:18,922
Speaker 1: I had to sing my thesis.

366
00:22:19,646 --> 00:22:20,370
Speaker 0: Oh, you're poor teacher.

367
00:22:20,792 --> 00:22:31,230
Speaker 1: Oh, I got to whistle after I was told by the teacher that I in fact I'm not one of the people who can say and by the people he meant everyone can sing.

368
00:22:35,461 --> 00:22:36,977
Speaker 1: Hummed it and I harmonica did.

369
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,340
Speaker 1: So, yeah, so we have these filters that are applied live.

370
00:22:41,601 --> 00:22:44,640
Speaker 1: So normally if we have a guest on the show, I'll just make like an extra template.

371
00:22:44,921 --> 00:22:46,187
Speaker 1: So I have this whole template already saved.

372
00:22:46,207 --> 00:22:46,750
Speaker 1: so I cue it up.

373
00:22:47,011 --> 00:22:52,903
Speaker 1: Look it even says like rim Scott bumpers sound effects Microphone three.

374
00:22:52,983 --> 00:22:57,520
Speaker 1: for if you use one of the weird microphones in my nickname be bumpers next time you want to be on bumpers?

375
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,369
Speaker 1: Bumpers has no effect.

376
00:22:59,389 --> 00:22:59,811
Speaker 1: sounded though.

377
00:22:59,831 --> 00:23:00,375
Speaker 1: That's the trouble.

378
00:23:00,556 --> 00:23:01,200
Speaker 0: Okay, that's fine.

379
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,765
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just like the word and we do more complicated stuff but you can learn that later.

380
00:23:04,805 --> 00:23:05,629
Speaker 1: the gist is right.

381
00:23:06,072 --> 00:23:16,300
Speaker 1: record yourself talking and Get the levels right to where you don't clip the microphone in the mixer themselves Like you never clip here and then you're gonna have to do something that's gonna feel really awful.

382
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:23,730
Speaker 1: You have to listen to your own voice on a loop like a few sentences and just listen to it on a loop for hours Fiddling with all these knobs.

383
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:25,360
Speaker 0: I was afraid you were gonna say something like that.

384
00:23:25,681 --> 00:23:27,752
Speaker 1: That is the only way to make a thing sound good.

385
00:23:28,154 --> 00:23:31,873
Speaker 0: Well, that's one way to desensitize Desensitize yourself to how stupid you sound.

386
00:23:32,156 --> 00:23:32,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what?

387
00:23:32,801 --> 00:23:35,000
Speaker 1: Everyone sounds both stupid and awesome on the radio.

388
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:40,139
Speaker 1: You sound stupid because you're not used to hearing your own voice and you sound awesome because actually most people sound awesome.

389
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:41,685
Speaker 0: Most people really.

390
00:23:41,826 --> 00:23:43,452
Speaker 1: yeah, most people sound just great if you put it.

391
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:45,845
Speaker 1: if you record into a little bit of processing this sound Awesome.

392
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,064
Speaker 0: All right Audition is magic.

393
00:23:48,265 --> 00:23:50,995
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll just an audition like friendship is magic.

394
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:51,497
Speaker 0: Yeah.

395
00:23:51,838 --> 00:23:52,119
Speaker 1: Yeah.

396
00:23:53,684 --> 00:24:03,703
Speaker 1: so things of the day Notice how.

397
00:24:03,743 --> 00:24:06,634
Speaker 1: what happened there is that we stopped recording and then we started again.

398
00:24:06,996 --> 00:24:11,895
Speaker 1: Yeah for a split second Yeah, so in the old we do this mostly now just because it's easier to edit.

399
00:24:11,936 --> 00:24:16,699
Speaker 1: but in the old days We would try to record the whole show in one go and that's good.

400
00:24:17,304 --> 00:24:25,896
Speaker 1: But if you're gonna have a format where you switch between topics It's good to have a pause there so you can like get your shit together Like pull up the web page that talks about the thing that you're gonna talk about.

401
00:24:25,917 --> 00:24:28,671
Speaker 0: make sense Yeah, except I didn't know I was gonna be here.

402
00:24:28,711 --> 00:24:30,300
Speaker 0: So I don't have a thing exactly.

403
00:24:30,921 --> 00:24:44,034
Speaker 1: but if you want to sound smart on a podcast the best thing to do if you're talking about a thing have the Wikipedia of that thing just up in front of you so you can say things like like Scott will be like, oh Yeah, it was in like 1993 94 and you can be like.

404
00:24:44,155 --> 00:24:45,562
Speaker 1: actually it was in 1991.

405
00:24:45,562 --> 00:24:47,240
Speaker 0: I knew that's what you guys were doing.

406
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,988
Speaker 1: That is that is how everyone does it.

407
00:24:50,148 --> 00:24:56,280
Speaker 1: everyone who's smart on the radio or a podcast just has Wikipedia in front of them And if they're doing a video they have a teleprompter.

408
00:24:57,461 --> 00:24:58,705
Speaker 0: Words from the wise.

409
00:24:58,725 --> 00:25:00,491
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course right now.

410
00:25:00,511 --> 00:25:01,334
Speaker 1: I'm just looking at Twitter.

411
00:25:01,354 --> 00:25:03,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's not Wikipedia.

412
00:25:04,761 --> 00:25:05,502
Speaker 1: It might as well be.

413
00:25:05,522 --> 00:25:10,072
Speaker 1: oh, they're looking at a phone now.

414
00:25:10,293 --> 00:25:13,440
Speaker 1: We've broke the magic's broken shows derailing rapidly.

415
00:25:16,325 --> 00:25:17,940
Speaker 0: I don't get a computer like you do.

416
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:22,071
Speaker 0: All I saw on that phone just then was the word rapist.

417
00:25:22,191 --> 00:25:26,377
Speaker 0: I don't know if I want if I want to talk about Whatever that is What?

418
00:25:27,942 --> 00:25:29,511
Speaker 0: You guys that's the word I saw.

419
00:25:29,651 --> 00:25:31,139
Speaker 1: there's trouble going on in the studio here.

420
00:25:32,068 --> 00:25:42,540
Speaker 1: so I recommend you find some songs that either Don't have copyright encumbrance or get someone to write them for you or steal something that no one will ever recognize.

421
00:25:43,144 --> 00:25:44,695
Speaker 0: I think I'm more comfortable with the first two.

422
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:50,919
Speaker 1: Yeah We have permission for our opening song and I will not tell you where the other songs came from.

423
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,748
Speaker 1: Luckily no, I don't think anyone's ever actually figured it out.

424
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:57,136
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day.

425
00:25:57,417 --> 00:26:00,039
Speaker 1: This is our bit OC do not steal.

426
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,073
Speaker 1: Okay, so you know about our things of the day, right?

427
00:26:04,234 --> 00:26:04,556
Speaker 1: Yes.

428
00:26:04,616 --> 00:26:05,460
Speaker 1: Can you think of a thing?

429
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,691
Speaker 1: What's the most awesome thing you've seen in the last 24 hours?

430
00:26:07,711 --> 00:26:11,550
Speaker 0: Oh Jesus I don't know the last 24 hours.

431
00:26:11,791 --> 00:26:17,996
Speaker 1: Oh originally it was didn't have to be a link It would just be like yeah totally saw a guy pass out on the train and mrs.

432
00:26:18,016 --> 00:26:19,080
Speaker 1: Stop and that was hilarious.

433
00:26:20,181 --> 00:26:26,182
Speaker 0: Saw a baby bird being fed by its mom went to the US Open last night for the first time ever despite the fact that I Live in Flushing.

434
00:26:26,363 --> 00:26:26,804
Speaker 1: Oh, dude.

435
00:26:27,245 --> 00:26:28,168
Speaker 1: Yeah, that sounds awesome.

436
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:29,011
Speaker 1: I really like tennis.

437
00:26:29,553 --> 00:26:31,539
Speaker 0: Serena Williams just kind of ate her opponent.

438
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:39,269
Speaker 1: Yeah literally I Was making a vore joke not a sex joke.

439
00:26:39,309 --> 00:26:44,627
Speaker 0: you you happen to be talking to a gay thing over here So I thought you were being derogatory.

440
00:26:44,727 --> 00:26:45,770
Speaker 1: No, I was not being derogatory.

441
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:46,974
Speaker 1: She's fucking amazing.

442
00:26:47,014 --> 00:26:47,536
Speaker 0: Yes, she is.

443
00:26:47,556 --> 00:26:48,680
Speaker 1: I love tennis.

444
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:49,686
Speaker 1: I love tennis a lot.

445
00:26:50,793 --> 00:26:58,675
Speaker 1: Well, we have to segregate Actual sexes because testosterone is literally just like hacks mode in tennis is it so is?

446
00:26:58,876 --> 00:27:03,188
Speaker 1: I love the fact that women's tennis is Just as awesome as men's tennis just as beastly.

447
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:03,690
Speaker 1: Yep.

448
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:04,873
Speaker 0: There was no mercy.

449
00:27:04,893 --> 00:27:08,857
Speaker 1: I Also love how there was a heat wave going on.

450
00:27:09,705 --> 00:27:13,086
Speaker 1: Some of the matches I watched on the internet Got pretty sad toward the end.

451
00:27:13,147 --> 00:27:20,500
Speaker 1: and is it bad if my bad person for the fact that I like watching tennis matches that start Strong and get increasingly sad as people wear out into a long deuce?

452
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,720
Speaker 0: Isn't that every long tennis match ever?

453
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,287
Speaker 1: But by the end like I forget who I was watching.

454
00:27:25,307 --> 00:27:28,320
Speaker 1: but I saw this highlight clip where the serve was made.

455
00:27:28,701 --> 00:27:34,500
Speaker 1: It was returned derpally like burp and the receiver of the return just stood there.

456
00:27:35,482 --> 00:27:40,423
Speaker 1: Yeah, it just went by and he totally could have just if he just like run a little bit He could have gotten it.

457
00:27:40,464 --> 00:27:41,850
Speaker 0: that happened a few times last night.

458
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,000
Speaker 0: It was like really frustrating to watch.

459
00:27:44,524 --> 00:27:46,360
Speaker 1: I love watching that because he knew it too.

460
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:51,847
Speaker 1: Like I saw like you see him turn to turn and look at the ball and then he's like He does a Daria.

461
00:27:51,867 --> 00:27:54,239
Speaker 0: He just stands there puts his hand out a little bit.

462
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,807
Speaker 0: No, we were watching a jokovich vs.

463
00:27:58,867 --> 00:28:02,880
Speaker 0: Murray, which is a really big match and it was going on for ever.

464
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:11,520
Speaker 0: They were constantly tying and we eventually left because it was midnight and we chalked it up to whoever feels old first We'll be losing tonight.

465
00:28:12,522 --> 00:28:23,876
Speaker 1: one of my co-workers was apparently also at that game and they watched it to the end and When asked if that was worth it The answer was no, but I'm gonna say yes to anyone else who asks me that.

466
00:28:23,896 --> 00:28:25,220
Speaker 0: Oh the secrets out.

467
00:28:25,441 --> 00:28:27,114
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think he knows.

468
00:28:27,174 --> 00:28:27,859
Speaker 1: I do geek nights.

469
00:28:31,561 --> 00:28:34,719
Speaker 1: So my thing of the day if you follow me on Twitter you might have seen this.

470
00:28:35,201 --> 00:28:42,391
Speaker 1: We we went to a secret restaurant in Seattle after Pax two years in a row and Apparently no one who goes to Pax knows about this place.

471
00:28:42,431 --> 00:28:44,060
Speaker 0: That's where you took the pictures of the ice cream.

472
00:28:45,122 --> 00:28:48,287
Speaker 1: Yes So the internet might be able to figure it out.

473
00:28:48,609 --> 00:28:52,044
Speaker 1: Scott ate so much that he sounded like he was dying when he was laying In bed.

474
00:28:52,386 --> 00:28:53,819
Speaker 0: how much food can Scott fit in him?

475
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:58,897
Speaker 1: Scott cannot eat as much food as the rest of us and as Scott is said an old geek nights.

476
00:28:58,938 --> 00:29:03,439
Speaker 1: if he eats too much Food the food comes out in every direction and every path.

477
00:29:05,902 --> 00:29:07,977
Speaker 1: He laid in bed and he was just made all night.

478
00:29:08,017 --> 00:29:08,339
Speaker 1: he was like.

479
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:15,099
Speaker 0: Just have the worst image now of Scott bleeding ice cream from his eyeballs.

480
00:29:18,641 --> 00:29:19,965
Speaker 0: So what a terrible.

481
00:29:19,985 --> 00:29:24,559
Speaker 1: do the bathroom and he comes back he's like guys that bathroom.

482
00:29:26,382 --> 00:29:29,140
Speaker 1: And then I remembered that the previous year we had the bathroom had also been awesome.

483
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,371
Speaker 1: So I go in there and I made two vines of this.

484
00:29:31,753 --> 00:29:33,220
Speaker 1: what's going on in the men's bathroom?

485
00:29:33,541 --> 00:29:33,862
Speaker 1: Is there?

486
00:29:33,962 --> 00:29:55,178
Speaker 1: is there are two old analog TVs or like one one like old LCD and one like really old CRT and they're playing a loop of footage of like fire hoses and waterfalls and kids playing in sprinklers and Like geysers and meanwhile ride of the Valkyries is just looping.

487
00:29:55,881 --> 00:29:57,208
Speaker 0: That is awesome.

488
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,293
Speaker 1: Never again.

489
00:29:58,313 --> 00:30:06,346
Speaker 0: a shy bladder Is that before you make it to the urinal or the stall or so it's there on the TVs Behind the urinals.

490
00:30:06,608 --> 00:30:08,640
Speaker 1: there is a mirror in front of each urinal.

491
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,517
Speaker 1: So you are guaranteed to be able to see that TV.

492
00:30:12,642 --> 00:30:17,600
Speaker 0: So it's not like a test like as soon as you walk in you have to run because all of a sudden it's been made.

493
00:30:18,781 --> 00:30:19,203
Speaker 1: There's a thing.

494
00:30:19,263 --> 00:30:28,017
Speaker 1: I don't know you probably haven't ever experienced this but a lot of guys Can't pee if there's another guy in the room that they're in any way intimidated by and

495
00:30:28,037 --> 00:30:29,583
Speaker 0: say I've ever Experienced

496
00:30:29,683 --> 00:30:37,953
Speaker 1: men experience this shy bladder thing like it like ask people on the internet and like a lot of people Will often just like clam up and they can't pee if someone's nearby.

497
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:39,720
Speaker 0: We don't have the whole urinal thing.

498
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what urinals are amazing.

499
00:30:41,771 --> 00:30:43,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, they look pretty easy.

500
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,353
Speaker 1: In fact, you know what is better than urinal just a trough in bars.

501
00:30:46,373 --> 00:30:47,297
Speaker 1: We'll just have like a trough.

502
00:30:47,317 --> 00:30:52,631
Speaker 1: It's just like this long tub And you know what it means.

503
00:30:52,913 --> 00:30:53,979
Speaker 1: there is never a line.

504
00:30:54,981 --> 00:31:00,207
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know people like to make that joke about ladies all going to the bathroom together But really it's not cuz.

505
00:31:00,227 --> 00:31:01,552
Speaker 1: the line is like four years long.

506
00:31:02,054 --> 00:31:02,315
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

507
00:31:02,496 --> 00:31:03,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, that shit sucks.

508
00:31:04,621 --> 00:31:06,688
Speaker 1: Maybe if we had gender-neutral bathrooms, we could fix that.

509
00:31:06,928 --> 00:31:10,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, why don't we just have the urinal bathroom and the non urinal bathroom?

510
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,501
Speaker 1: That will work.

511
00:31:11,742 --> 00:31:13,968
Speaker 1: and then the baby bathroom in case anyone has a baby.

512
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:15,252
Speaker 0: Yes, please.

513
00:31:15,653 --> 00:31:16,376
Speaker 0: Can we have those?

514
00:31:16,396 --> 00:31:23,145
Speaker 1: I got to listen to a side a father and his like Just starting to talk.

515
00:31:23,205 --> 00:31:25,632
Speaker 1: daughter doing their like doing their like.

516
00:31:25,973 --> 00:31:27,277
Speaker 1: kids can't deal with the bathroom.

517
00:31:27,297 --> 00:31:28,220
Speaker 1: yet in the stall next to me.

518
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:35,160
Speaker 1: well, I was pooping at packs and they were really loud and He was like being funny and like okay, dude.

519
00:31:35,281 --> 00:31:44,585
Speaker 1: But basically I got to experience this whole thing auditorily while I was sitting in the cell next to them and it was just really weird and awkward because he's like All right.

520
00:31:44,626 --> 00:31:45,772
Speaker 1: Now you get to flush it.

521
00:31:45,812 --> 00:31:50,700
Speaker 1: She's like, yeah That's how you get a kid pumped and then you hear flush flush.

522
00:31:51,741 --> 00:31:55,199
Speaker 1: No only flush once but dad flush once.

523
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:58,812
Speaker 1: Otherwise you'll fall in and it'll suck.

524
00:31:58,832 --> 00:32:02,688
Speaker 1: He was like it'll suck you away And she's like really he's like really.

525
00:32:02,909 --> 00:32:05,180
Speaker 1: and then she got stone silence.

526
00:32:06,101 --> 00:32:10,940
Speaker 1: Like, you know that moment when a kid like is told something that you think is funny, but they're taking seriously.

527
00:32:11,241 --> 00:32:15,219
Speaker 1: Yes, like like when a kid watches Beetlejuice for the first time and they don't realize there's a comedy.

528
00:32:16,582 --> 00:32:20,362
Speaker 0: That was me on an airplane at age five Terrified.

529
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:24,500
Speaker 1: that was also me watching Beetlejuice and project eco.

530
00:32:24,681 --> 00:32:27,853
Speaker 0: Apparently I freaked out so hard that they had to subdue me.

531
00:32:27,934 --> 00:32:32,224
Speaker 0: I was five years old and on my way to Vegas Wow, you started young.

532
00:32:32,244 --> 00:32:32,886
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

533
00:32:33,548 --> 00:32:37,400
Speaker 1: I just picture five-year-old you with like a cigar and just a pile of poker chips.

534
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:49,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, and this little stuffed animal of Roger Rabbit in the seat next to me Living it up, you know when I was really when I first saw Roger Rabbit, like I really liked it But I also took it way serious.

535
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:49,291
Speaker 1: Yep.

536
00:32:49,552 --> 00:32:49,793
Speaker 1: Yep.

537
00:32:49,853 --> 00:32:51,299
Speaker 0: Yep that part with this with the shoe.

538
00:32:51,561 --> 00:32:54,479
Speaker 1: Yep that part with the shoe, which actually was just a straight-up murder.

539
00:32:55,221 --> 00:32:56,325
Speaker 0: Forget that part man.

540
00:32:56,365 --> 00:33:00,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, and at the end when the crazy eyes come out, I about flipped a brick.

541
00:33:02,583 --> 00:33:03,317
Speaker 0: It's Doc Brown.

542
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:08,331
Speaker 1: So in the meta moment the book club book is a canticle for Liebowitz.

543
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:11,060
Speaker 1: Scott read part of it because he was on a plane.

544
00:33:12,121 --> 00:33:14,993
Speaker 1: I got to read it again because I forgot most of the allegory at this point.

545
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:16,540
Speaker 1: So thanks Scott.

546
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:20,360
Speaker 1: I read five fucking novels the time it took you to get two-thirds of the way through Liebowitz.

547
00:33:20,922 --> 00:33:21,826
Speaker 0: You're just a better person.

548
00:33:22,107 --> 00:33:22,348
Speaker 1: Yeah.

549
00:33:22,548 --> 00:33:24,175
Speaker 1: Also, you should read a canticle for Liebowitz.

550
00:33:24,195 --> 00:33:25,460
Speaker 1: Why do you know what it's about?

551
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:31,459
Speaker 1: Nope, it's arguably the first or the second modern apocalypse story.

552
00:33:31,881 --> 00:33:40,037
Speaker 1: Okay, as in an apocalypse caused by technology like, you know post-apocalyptic Wool style silo paranoia all those things.

553
00:33:40,298 --> 00:33:44,614
Speaker 1: All right Those novels really didn't exist until nuclear Armageddon was a possibility.

554
00:33:44,634 --> 00:33:46,199
Speaker 1: This is probably the first one.

555
00:33:46,741 --> 00:33:51,055
Speaker 1: What year was this written in during the Cold War like the early part of the Cold War?

556
00:33:51,075 --> 00:33:52,440
Speaker 0: and what makes it not suck?

557
00:33:53,105 --> 00:33:53,367
Speaker 1: It's just.

558
00:33:53,447 --> 00:33:54,516
Speaker 1: it's not that it doesn't suck.

559
00:33:54,556 --> 00:34:22,000
Speaker 1: I'm not But it's basically roughly about a guy named Liebowitz who's not in the book, he's long dead and he was just like this engineer and Because after the world got destroyed by an apocalypse his writings and like stuff about him Sort of became Legend and he was sainted by like the church that sort of picked up the ashes of the post-apocalyptic world.

560
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:23,384
Speaker 1: So st.

561
00:34:23,404 --> 00:34:27,896
Speaker 1: Liebowitz and the holy artifacts like here's his box of resistors.

562
00:34:27,956 --> 00:34:29,600
Speaker 1: They don't know what resistors are anymore.

563
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,123
Speaker 0: So this was a normal dude.

564
00:34:31,485 --> 00:34:31,666
Speaker 1: Yes.

565
00:34:31,746 --> 00:34:33,010
Speaker 1: This is a normal day now st.

566
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:39,688
Speaker 1: Liebowitz and it takes place after the apocalypse and It's the first book like that other than me.

567
00:34:39,728 --> 00:34:43,663
Speaker 1: There's arguably one earlier book, but that's about zombies About zombies.

568
00:34:43,984 --> 00:34:44,585
Speaker 1: Yeah zombies.

569
00:34:45,088 --> 00:34:48,980
Speaker 1: That's an apocalypse story sort of like zombies and people dying and stuff zombies in before.

570
00:34:49,926 --> 00:34:50,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, possibly.

571
00:34:51,012 --> 00:34:51,656
Speaker 1: It's arguable.

572
00:34:51,696 --> 00:34:52,280
Speaker 1: It's debatable.

573
00:34:53,545 --> 00:34:54,318
Speaker 1: Okay, pretty good book.

574
00:34:54,701 --> 00:35:00,380
Speaker 1: You got to know a lot about Jews and a lot about Catholics or it's really hard to understand what this is talking about.

575
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:10,160
Speaker 1: define a lot, um You would get most of the Jewish references and I think as a result you could parse the Catholicism like inside baseball.

576
00:35:10,681 --> 00:35:14,194
Speaker 0: Okay, yeah, it's the Catholicism I worry about in the same way that I'm not.

577
00:35:14,656 --> 00:35:21,520
Speaker 1: I'm not the most Deep person when it comes to Jewish stuff, but I remember a lot of weird Catholic inside baseball.

578
00:35:21,821 --> 00:35:25,855
Speaker 1: So I was able to parse the Jewish stuff by juxtaposing it with the Catholic stuff that was happening.

579
00:35:26,116 --> 00:35:27,400
Speaker 0: All right, then it's pretty good.

580
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,412
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't want to be studying any more Catholicism.

581
00:35:29,432 --> 00:35:34,646
Speaker 0: I already took in our history course We were a Pax.

582
00:35:34,948 --> 00:35:37,220
Speaker 1: Pax is done a bunch of videos from Pax.

583
00:35:37,441 --> 00:35:40,915
Speaker 1: We coming up online as soon as I can get to it for all of you saws at Pax.

584
00:35:41,237 --> 00:35:41,920
Speaker 1: That was awesome.

585
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:49,342

Speaker 0: That is also legit.

653
00:39:03,822 --> 00:39:06,880
Speaker 1: So, yeah now that's the part where we do the main show but if we kind of already did it.

654
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:14,165
Speaker 1: So you have any questions about like what you should do podcasting that I can answer an audio form That you can answer an audio form.

655
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,230
Speaker 1: Yeah as opposed to like showing screens of things.

656
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:21,256
Speaker 0: Hmm, you mean like technical questions anything and what questions would you ask?

657
00:39:21,316 --> 00:39:22,180
Speaker 1: This is your moments.

658
00:39:22,341 --> 00:39:24,259
Speaker 0: How do you get past the whole idea of?

659
00:39:24,661 --> 00:39:29,660
Speaker 0: Every other podcaster talks about this stuff like anime or games or something like those podcasts all fucking suck.

660
00:39:30,761 --> 00:39:32,145
Speaker 1: Okay, that's how I got past it.

661
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:32,446
Speaker 1: Actually.

662
00:39:32,466 --> 00:39:34,131
Speaker 1: Well, we originally got past it by.

663
00:39:34,191 --> 00:39:35,415
Speaker 1: there really aren't podcasts.

664
00:39:36,257 --> 00:39:40,011
Speaker 1: Let's do one Like the podcast weren't much of a thing yet.

665
00:39:40,051 --> 00:39:41,800
Speaker 0: Wasn't that like 25 years ago or something?

666
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:48,376
Speaker 1: Scott actually arguably did the first podcast the first podcast so podcasting was not yet a term.

667
00:39:48,396 --> 00:39:48,817
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

668
00:39:49,058 --> 00:39:49,419
Speaker 1: We were at RIT.

669
00:39:50,482 --> 00:39:55,737
Speaker 1: Scott was like I should just record audio of me talking and put it online and kind of syndicate it.

670
00:39:56,078 --> 00:39:56,560
Speaker 1: and he did it.

671
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,388
Speaker 1: There's an episode of proto geek nights.

672
00:39:59,649 --> 00:40:02,640
Speaker 1: and when Scott and I were in RIT and then he was like, that was really hard.

673
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,523
Speaker 1: I'm never doing that again.

674
00:40:04,807 --> 00:40:06,091
Speaker 1: And then podcasting became a word.

675
00:40:06,091 --> 00:40:09,883
Speaker 1: 25 years later, but seriously nowadays Listen to a pie.

676
00:40:09,923 --> 00:40:12,210
Speaker 1: if you listen to any podcast not very many.

677
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:14,076
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're awful.

678
00:40:14,738 --> 00:40:26,039
Speaker 1: I listen to anime world order fast karate for the gentleman pseudopod and Most other podcasts are either awful or stopped.

679
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:34,060
Speaker 1: Okay I don't find most podcasts good and I think that you could do better than the vast majority of podcasts on these topics.

680
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,014
Speaker 0: So just bolstering yourself by telling yourself everyone else sucks.

681
00:40:37,175 --> 00:40:37,698
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what.

682
00:40:37,718 --> 00:40:40,050
Speaker 1: if you want it If you need to believe that go listen to some podcasts.

683
00:40:40,131 --> 00:40:41,036
Speaker 0: Oh, I do that all the time.

684
00:40:41,056 --> 00:40:45,960
Speaker 1: I can do that Yeah, just like find a podcast about the thing you're gonna talk about and just listen to it.

685
00:40:47,147 --> 00:40:51,259
Speaker 0: Then you get angry enough fuel your show with rage.

686
00:40:53,021 --> 00:41:02,495
Speaker 1: the other thing too is either differentiate yourself like do something different or get by solely on your Personalities and banters such that it doesn't matter what you're talking about.

687
00:41:02,535 --> 00:41:03,480
Speaker 1: That's the fast karate style.

688
00:41:04,221 --> 00:41:05,144
Speaker 0: That's something I can do too.

689
00:41:05,164 --> 00:41:06,489
Speaker 1: Yeah, just be funny.

690
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,135
Speaker 1: get it get a shit going to get a routine.

691
00:41:08,516 --> 00:41:09,560
Speaker 0: I'm super funny.

692
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,127
Speaker 0: I mean you people have been listening to me, right?

693
00:41:11,328 --> 00:41:12,553
Speaker 1: Yeah, Judith is a laugh riot.

694
00:41:12,955 --> 00:41:13,979
Speaker 0: They've all turned it off by now.

695
00:41:15,103 --> 00:41:16,759
Speaker 0: Last person just hit the X button.

696
00:41:17,342 --> 00:41:18,264
Speaker 0: Screw this bitch.

697
00:41:18,284 --> 00:41:19,247
Speaker 1: the self-deprecating joke.

698
00:41:19,267 --> 00:41:21,033
Speaker 1: We always use is whenever we talk about the listeners.

699
00:41:21,253 --> 00:41:26,023
Speaker 1: We always say well the listener will agree But we did.

700
00:41:26,063 --> 00:41:27,268
Speaker 1: I just stole that from NPR.

701
00:41:27,308 --> 00:41:29,236
Speaker 1: it's all politics, but they stopped.

702
00:41:29,698 --> 00:41:32,726
Speaker 1: so I guess Where was the joke from The Simpsons?

703
00:41:32,987 --> 00:41:35,256
Speaker 1: if you're anyone other than NPR, it's all politics.

704
00:41:35,276 --> 00:41:36,099
Speaker 1: You're stealing my joke.

705
00:41:36,962 --> 00:41:38,387
Speaker 0: Don't ask me Simpsons questions.

706
00:41:38,808 --> 00:41:41,919
Speaker 0: What I was denied Simpsons as a child never got into it.

707
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:42,160
Speaker 1: both.

708
00:41:42,821 --> 00:41:44,225
Speaker 0: I was forbidden from watching it.

709
00:41:44,867 --> 00:41:53,700
Speaker 1: It is amazing to me and it should be amazing to all you young fucks out there that When The Simpsons aired on TV, a lot of parents wouldn't let their kids watch it.

710
00:41:53,881 --> 00:41:55,268
Speaker 1: Yeah, like that shit was controversial.

711
00:41:55,288 --> 00:41:57,300
Speaker 1: You were not allowed to wear a Bart Simpson shirt to school.

712
00:41:57,622 --> 00:42:01,943
Speaker 0: I watched some episodes of it now and I'm thinking What I want.

713
00:42:01,964 --> 00:42:07,900
Speaker 1: your point made me turn my Bart Simpson t-shirt inside out or they would not let me in.

714
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,465
Speaker 0: Was he a controversial character?

715
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,207
Speaker 0: Is that why?

716
00:42:10,548 --> 00:42:13,458
Speaker 1: Well, the shirt had the word hell on it and tiny print.

717
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,484
Speaker 1: Oh It was a shirt.

718
00:42:15,705 --> 00:42:18,694
Speaker 1: There was Bart Simpson with a speech bubble and it said I'm Bart Simpson.

719
00:42:18,715 --> 00:42:19,377
Speaker 1: Who the hell are you?

720
00:42:19,397 --> 00:42:24,470
Speaker 0: I guess Who the he double hockey sticks are you?

721
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,313
Speaker 0: That's all it said.

722
00:42:25,715 --> 00:42:29,464
Speaker 1: Also Bart said bitchin' once Those early seasons.

723
00:42:29,925 --> 00:42:38,120
Speaker 0: Oh, no, I think pretty much that show was controversial until South Park came out And then everything after that was just the flushing of a toilet.

724
00:42:38,661 --> 00:42:39,344
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

725
00:42:39,565 --> 00:42:43,200
Speaker 1: Thing is Simpsons was good for at least 11 seasons and honestly New Simpsons is pretty good again.

726
00:42:43,562 --> 00:42:45,253
Speaker 0: I never did get into it though, but you can.

727
00:42:45,273 --> 00:42:46,280
Speaker 0: you can blame my parents for that.

728
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,143
Speaker 1: You know what you should do?

729
00:42:47,203 --> 00:42:50,052
Speaker 1: Just take season 5 just pirate it and just watch it.

730
00:42:50,513 --> 00:42:52,620
Speaker 1: It's really really funny.

731
00:42:52,841 --> 00:42:55,099
Speaker 0: Yeah, pirating stuff is how you show your support for it, right?

732
00:42:56,281 --> 00:42:57,788
Speaker 1: I don't think the Simpsons need my support.

733
00:42:58,149 --> 00:43:04,407
Speaker 1: I think the Simpsons is going to run for the rest of my life probably Hopefully Adventure Time will too.

734
00:43:05,071 --> 00:43:05,432
Speaker 0: I don't know.

735
00:43:05,513 --> 00:43:05,734
Speaker 0: No, no.

736
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,819
Speaker 0: No, I don't want to say something like that.

737
00:43:07,161 --> 00:43:07,381
Speaker 1: I do.

738
00:43:07,442 --> 00:43:07,943
Speaker 1: I want it to.

739
00:43:07,963 --> 00:43:08,806
Speaker 1: I want it to.

740
00:43:08,826 --> 00:43:16,800
Speaker 1: I want Adventure Time to be like that comic in the newspaper Where the characters just all aged in real time and it went on for fucking ever.

741
00:43:17,131 --> 00:43:25,504
Speaker 0: Yeah But American TV for better or for worse has this way of pile driving shows into the ground once they reach a certain age until They're just not the same.

742
00:43:25,524 --> 00:43:30,460
Speaker 1: Adventure Time has gotten way past the point where that usually happens and has only gotten better.

743
00:43:30,824 --> 00:43:32,060
Speaker 0: It's gotten much more mature.

744
00:43:32,101 --> 00:43:35,407
Speaker 1: Yes It's changed and not gotten worse.

745
00:43:35,447 --> 00:43:43,312
Speaker 1: name another show that has changed for the better or at least changed for the same level of quality But being different pleading the fifth at the moment.

746
00:43:43,613 --> 00:43:46,663
Speaker 1: Yeah name any show Show.

747
00:43:46,843 --> 00:43:50,660
Speaker 1: I bet a show on American TV that changed and the change was for the good.

748
00:43:50,821 --> 00:43:53,673
Speaker 1: I could probably come up with something I can name after this show is over.

749
00:43:53,693 --> 00:43:54,276
Speaker 1: I can name one.

750
00:43:54,296 --> 00:43:54,416
Speaker 1: Whoa?

751
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,136
Speaker 1: No, you have to say it out loud now.

752
00:43:57,156 --> 00:44:00,374
Speaker 0: No No, I think I can come up with something when the pressure is not on.

753
00:44:00,414 --> 00:44:04,007
Speaker 1: is what I thought you were meaning You were about to say something that would piss off tumblr or whatever.

754
00:44:04,148 --> 00:44:06,736
Speaker 0: No, I love pissing off tumblr.

755
00:44:07,117 --> 00:44:07,860
Speaker 1: Ah, that's a hobby.

756
00:44:08,762 --> 00:44:10,535
Speaker 0: They forgive me cuz I'm probably gay.

757
00:44:10,555 --> 00:44:23,420
Speaker 1: my one See in a way cishet white males are more oppressed Because don't even don't even start because if I say something racist and sexist the internet jumps all down my throat.

758
00:44:23,821 --> 00:44:30,180
Speaker 1: But then if I get reverse racism or white slave then suddenly remember the iPhone I was gonna throw at you.

759
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:32,057
Speaker 0: It's gonna be a wheeling chair this time.

760
00:44:34,601 --> 00:44:35,483
Speaker 1: But there's my.

761
00:44:35,604 --> 00:44:46,085
Speaker 1: one example is South Park because the first like half of the first season was just little kids swearing and Then the show got good Like the first episode.

762
00:44:46,286 --> 00:44:47,750
Speaker 1: I also like those episodes.

763
00:44:47,791 --> 00:44:49,636
Speaker 1: but the show changed and got way better.

764
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:54,337
Speaker 0: in my opinion It got more political but in a good way, yeah, I love our.

765
00:44:54,358 --> 00:45:00,113
Speaker 1: South Park Really does a good job of taking the piss out of any argument no matter how stupid it is.

766
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,018
Speaker 1: I Am hard-pressed to name any American show that changing got better.

767
00:45:06,463 --> 00:45:07,578
Speaker 0: No, no, that's a big challenge.

768
00:45:07,921 --> 00:45:11,820
Speaker 1: Seinfeld got incrementally better for a long time just as the craft got better.

769
00:45:11,901 --> 00:45:13,919
Speaker 1: But that wasn't a change in the way the show was.

770
00:45:14,105 --> 00:45:21,371
Speaker 0: Yes It wasn't like we're gonna go dark like Adventure Time did when you put the word American as a qualifier for that then I can't come up with anything.

771
00:45:21,953 --> 00:45:27,370
Speaker 1: I'm trying what it was the anime Anime that changed for the better at any point.

772
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:28,533
Speaker 1: No, they all got worse.

773
00:45:29,035 --> 00:45:29,918
Speaker 1: They all got destroyed.

774
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:36,259
Speaker 1: Sailor Moon I guess changing got better in s but that's because they brought out the good Sailor Senji and the show got fucked up about Sailor Moon.

775
00:45:41,842 --> 00:45:48,313
Speaker 1: You know, I promise Scott I wouldn't shit all over that show anymore on the show because every time I complain about it Like why are you even watching it?

776
00:45:48,353 --> 00:45:49,100
Speaker 1: That shows awful.

777
00:45:50,141 --> 00:45:51,811
Speaker 0: I've watched more of it than you have now.

778
00:45:51,952 --> 00:45:53,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, you have and you know what?

779
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,088
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna rewatch all the old Sailor Moon again.

780
00:45:55,128 --> 00:45:56,515
Speaker 0: I'm doing both of those things.

781
00:45:56,635 --> 00:45:57,660
Speaker 0: Maybe I'm a better fan.

782
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,279
Speaker 1: Tenchi muyo just got worse and then worse again.

783
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:08,777
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then somehow worse up to the third power and in between they brought out.

784
00:46:09,078 --> 00:46:14,266
Speaker 1: Uh, gee But tenchi muyo gxp We didn't even have the characters.

785
00:46:14,326 --> 00:46:16,734
Speaker 1: I liked and somehow was also awful.

786
00:46:16,854 --> 00:46:18,399
Speaker 0: I gave up after worse again.

787
00:46:19,281 --> 00:46:19,804
Speaker 1: Where's the guy?

788
00:46:19,845 --> 00:46:22,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was tenchi in Tokyo burned me the worst.

789
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,265
Speaker 0: I think that was the worst.

790
00:46:23,466 --> 00:46:27,408
Speaker 1: that was the one where that was a put time in my life where I was also kind of Invested in tenchi.

791
00:46:27,529 --> 00:46:28,819
Speaker 1: There's a thing same here.

792
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:31,106
Speaker 1: Yeah, those are dark time.

793
00:46:31,146 --> 00:46:32,050
Speaker 1: I felt betrayed.

794
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:33,155
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like wow.

795
00:46:33,376 --> 00:46:34,440
Speaker 1: These are awesome characters.

796
00:46:34,701 --> 00:46:39,300
Speaker 1: This is an awesome show and it's a little perverted but in that funny way that like Ron mo was a little pervert.

797
00:46:40,261 --> 00:46:45,135
Speaker 1: Yep, the clothing like very few shows in that era animated clothing like that thing.

798
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:46,720
Speaker 1: Oh my goddess was the only other show.

799
00:46:47,582 --> 00:46:48,226
Speaker 0: That's a good example.

800
00:46:48,266 --> 00:46:50,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then you know what notice tenchi in Tokyo.

801
00:46:50,881 --> 00:46:58,420
Speaker 1: Everyone's wearing bicycle shorts because they just asked to animate that shit anymore and the animation style has been chopped not the style.

802
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:58,944
Speaker 0: I'm sorry.

803
00:46:58,964 --> 00:47:01,199
Speaker 0: This animation itself has been chopped to shit.

804
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:14,213
Speaker 0: Yeah, I said style because a long time ago I was still a high school student and I was complaining about the quality of the animation Descending into the pits of hell for tenchi in Tokyo and this Defensive guy was like that's just a style change.

805
00:47:14,374 --> 00:47:18,047
Speaker 0: if you can't handle that kind of thing Then you shouldn't be complaining about it.

806
00:47:18,227 --> 00:47:21,560
Speaker 1: I saw that same argument this morning about Sailor Moon crystal.

807
00:47:22,721 --> 00:47:25,669
Speaker 1: They were like no the transformation sequences are CG.

808
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:27,454
Speaker 1: So they have to look worse.

809
00:47:27,515 --> 00:47:29,400
Speaker 1: I was like wow, you're wrong on every point.

810
00:47:29,862 --> 00:47:32,354
Speaker 0: Why did they choose a medium that has to look worse?

811
00:47:32,414 --> 00:47:33,620
Speaker 0: then if that's your argument?

812
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,580
Speaker 1: Because it's a deconstruction is the latest argument.

813
00:47:40,243 --> 00:47:42,620
Speaker 1: Everything everything ever is now a deconstruction.

814
00:47:43,302 --> 00:47:45,690
Speaker 1: I think was Mike or someone who said that deconstruction.

815
00:47:45,971 --> 00:47:47,576
Speaker 1: the definition of that is I swear.

816
00:47:47,616 --> 00:47:48,459
Speaker 1: I'm not watching porn.

817
00:47:50,282 --> 00:47:52,018
Speaker 0: Sailor Moon is just the construction.

818
00:47:52,802 --> 00:47:55,411
Speaker 1: It's just the thing but it's like half finish.

819
00:47:55,451 --> 00:47:56,374
Speaker 1: It's like they built one wall.

820
00:47:56,394 --> 00:48:01,360
Speaker 1: They're like, yeah, fuck it good enough Just slap some eyes on it and in a gate mouth.

821
00:48:04,981 --> 00:48:08,493
Speaker 1: I Still can't come up with any anime that it made a change and got better.

822
00:48:08,714 --> 00:48:09,840
Speaker 0: No, you mentioned Ranma.

823
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,674
Speaker 0: I was a fan of a lot of Takahashi things and yeah, that's a terrible example.

824
00:48:13,935 --> 00:48:15,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, those shows didn't get better.

825
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,245
Speaker 1: They just never change.

826
00:48:16,265 --> 00:48:17,129
Speaker 1: That was the opposite problem.

827
00:48:17,149 --> 00:48:18,153
Speaker 1: by never changing.

828
00:48:18,193 --> 00:48:19,640
Speaker 1: They eventually ran out of shit to do.

829
00:48:19,822 --> 00:48:20,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, they didn't get endings.

830
00:48:21,361 --> 00:48:27,540
Speaker 1: I think Adventure Time would have ended if they had not continued to mature it and keep changing like the entire timber of the show.

831
00:48:27,701 --> 00:48:28,754
Speaker 0: Yeah, it would have spongebobbed.

832
00:48:30,601 --> 00:48:38,083
Speaker 1: I'm hard-pressed to agree with you because as far as I'm concerned spongebob spongebob the first sponging that ever Bob Like.

833
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:40,820
Speaker 1: I watched an episode of that show and I could summarize it as yeah.

834
00:48:44,281 --> 00:48:45,064
Speaker 1: And then credits.

835
00:48:45,687 --> 00:48:48,499
Speaker 0: there was some slightly more clever humor in those older ones.

836
00:48:49,001 --> 00:48:51,390
Speaker 0: Maybe you and I have slightly different senses of humor.

837
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,100
Speaker 0: Maybe I was an animation student.

838
00:48:54,281 --> 00:48:56,228
Speaker 0: I did like the anvils falling and all that.

839
00:48:56,429 --> 00:48:59,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I got that from like Monty Python animation.

840
00:49:00,622 --> 00:49:02,212
Speaker 0: I don't think that's a fair comparison.

841
00:49:02,333 --> 00:49:03,440
Speaker 1: I think that is a fair compare.

842
00:49:03,561 --> 00:49:07,800
Speaker 1: No, it's not fair because Monty Python when I was that age was the funniest thing in the world.

843
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:08,183
Speaker 1: You know what.

844
00:49:08,223 --> 00:49:08,988
Speaker 1: watching it again today.

845
00:49:09,008 --> 00:49:10,740
Speaker 1: It is still fucking hilarious.

846
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:16,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only reason I don't laugh at is because I've seen everything they've ever done like a hundred times over the course of my life.

847
00:49:16,822 --> 00:49:20,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have to usually wait about five years in between watching the Holy Grail.

848
00:49:20,822 --> 00:49:22,368
Speaker 1: I remember the first time I watched the Holy Grail.

849
00:49:22,829 --> 00:49:25,680
Speaker 1: I remember laughing so hard that I missed like entire scenes.

850
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:26,680
Speaker 0: Yes, it was the same for me.

851
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,700
Speaker 0: I was at Lisa's house on the couch as a high school student.

852
00:49:29,821 --> 00:49:30,766
Speaker 0: She just put it on being like.

853
00:49:30,786 --> 00:49:35,066
Speaker 0: this is going to be the funniest thing you've ever seen in your whole life Yep, for the longest time.

854
00:49:35,106 --> 00:49:35,508
Speaker 1: I ignored it.

855
00:49:35,548 --> 00:49:36,793
Speaker 1: My dad was like you should watch this movie.

856
00:49:36,813 --> 00:49:38,479
Speaker 1: I was like whatever dad whatever.

857
00:49:38,499 --> 00:49:42,509
Speaker 1: and Then yeah, like I was laughing so hard it hurts.

858
00:49:43,212 --> 00:49:45,700
Speaker 0: It looks old and it looks British and it looks live-action.

859
00:49:45,741 --> 00:49:46,719
Speaker 0: How could that be funny?

860
00:49:49,020 --> 00:50:00,834
Speaker 1: Granted I've realized a lot of kids today like don't even like like I almost said new kids on the block Kids in the hall or all like like 90s stand-up comedians or anything.

861
00:50:00,974 --> 00:50:01,957
Speaker 0: Are you so old?

862
00:50:01,977 --> 00:50:02,800
Speaker 1: I am really old.

863
00:50:03,141 --> 00:50:07,460
Speaker 1: I remember watching like a young Janine Garofalo and a young Steven Wright doing comedy on TV.

864
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:10,194
Speaker 0: I don't even know who those people are Wow.

865
00:50:10,214 --> 00:50:12,746
Speaker 1: Sorry Wow Steven Wright, okay.

866
00:50:12,826 --> 00:50:13,389
Speaker 1: I'm gonna I'm gonna.

867
00:50:13,409 --> 00:50:14,734
Speaker 1: I'm gonna do a Steven Wright joke.

868
00:50:14,815 --> 00:50:15,257
Speaker 1: This is what it.

869
00:50:15,277 --> 00:50:17,696
Speaker 0: despite his best joke Did I just lose a seven-year listener?

870
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:25,224
Speaker 1: So Finally finished.

871
00:50:25,244 --> 00:50:27,176
Speaker 1: the dictionary turns out.

872
00:50:27,196 --> 00:50:27,800
Speaker 1: the zebra did it.

873
00:50:30,263 --> 00:50:30,960
Speaker 1: That's Steven Wright.

874
00:50:32,601 --> 00:50:33,486
Speaker 1: What was his other joke?

875
00:50:33,747 --> 00:50:35,658
Speaker 1: one time I was walking through and he ended a night with this.

876
00:50:35,758 --> 00:50:45,225
Speaker 1: one time so I walked out into an alley and I look up and I see two kittens and the kittens jumped out a window did a triple backflip and landed on a box and I looked at him.

877
00:50:45,286 --> 00:50:48,063
Speaker 1: I said wow if that just happened I'm lost.

878
00:50:48,103 --> 00:50:48,365
Speaker 0: Sorry.

879
00:50:48,385 --> 00:50:51,219
Speaker 1: All of this is just like just we would talk like that completely deadpan.

880
00:50:51,701 --> 00:50:53,307
Speaker 1: That might not even be the joke, but it doesn't matter.

881
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:54,994
Speaker 1: He would just say things like this.

882
00:50:55,958 --> 00:50:56,981
Speaker 1: and that's the joke That works.

883
00:50:57,302 --> 00:50:57,924
Speaker 1: That's the joke.

884
00:50:58,706 --> 00:51:01,253
Speaker 0: that dictionary zebra thing almost sounded like a dad joke.

885
00:51:01,855 --> 00:51:03,620
Speaker 1: You mean an uncle joke either one.

886
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:04,946
Speaker 0: Yeah, uncle joke is better.

887
00:51:04,966 --> 00:51:07,700
Speaker 1: I prefer uncle joke mostly because of the Teen Titans go cache.

888
00:51:08,702 --> 00:51:17,299
Speaker 1: I have another listener who just gets every time I mentioned two times ago Like he flips his shit about how bad and disrespectful that show it was better than the first one.

889
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:19,039
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what?

890
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,806
Speaker 1: Everything is better than the first Teen Titans.

891
00:51:22,047 --> 00:51:26,620
Speaker 1: That was such like animu wannabe crap like it had sweat drops.

892
00:51:27,403 --> 00:51:29,132
Speaker 1: They were like, what are the kids into these days?

893
00:51:29,212 --> 00:51:30,237
Speaker 1: I don't know anime.

894
00:51:30,357 --> 00:51:30,900
Speaker 1: What's anime?

895
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:34,811
Speaker 1: So take our show draw it worse add sweat drops and we're good to go.

896
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:37,540
Speaker 0: Everybody's head randomly gets giant at a silly scene.

897
00:51:37,724 --> 00:51:40,024
Speaker 1: It's called Cheebification.

898
00:51:40,044 --> 00:51:41,351
Speaker 1: I learned that from the internet.

899
00:51:41,592 --> 00:51:43,280
Speaker 1: So do you want you need to animate that shit?

900
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:48,220
Speaker 0: There was certainly an air of desperation to the Teen Titans art style at the very least.

901
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:54,740
Speaker 1: The worst thing was it would alternate between super bad comedy and super bad like ultra serial drama.

902
00:51:55,302 --> 00:52:00,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, like they were kind of star fires drama with Beast Boy and everybody.

903
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,734
Speaker 1: They all love each other and Tara betrayed them.

904
00:52:02,794 --> 00:52:03,900
Speaker 1: and oh my gosh.

905
00:52:04,523 --> 00:52:07,258
Speaker 0: Yeah, it almost seemed like they were trying to go dark like Batman the animated series.

906
00:52:07,379 --> 00:52:07,459
Speaker 0: ish.

907
00:52:07,821 --> 00:52:11,894
Speaker 1: But then they would go chibi with sweat drops like the next scene.

908
00:52:12,054 --> 00:52:13,960
Speaker 0: No, I tried I couldn't take it seriously.

909
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,125
Speaker 1: I couldn't even watch it.

910
00:52:15,186 --> 00:52:16,291
Speaker 1: It was painful to watch.

911
00:52:16,411 --> 00:52:18,220
Speaker 0: I can take Teen Titans go seriously.

912
00:52:20,122 --> 00:52:27,112
Speaker 1: Teen Titans go has the bonus point that Raven has killed a lot of people And that is the primary reason I like that show.

913
00:52:27,133 --> 00:52:29,584
Speaker 0: I Think she's my favorite.

914
00:52:29,986 --> 00:52:32,476
Speaker 1: She is definitely my favorite but Beast Boy is my second favorite.

915
00:52:32,838 --> 00:52:36,392
Speaker 1: Beast Boy Yeah, because Beast Boy is actually kind of adorable.

916
00:52:36,493 --> 00:52:38,360
Speaker 0: he actually has like the cutest voice.

917
00:52:38,501 --> 00:52:41,452
Speaker 0: I don't know who does his voice, but I haven't heard it anywhere else.

918
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:43,299
Speaker 0: I don't think he's also animated.

919
00:52:43,319 --> 00:52:43,640
Speaker 1: really funny.

920
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,979
Speaker 1: Like there's one episode where the second the elevator and he really has to pee.

921
00:52:46,602 --> 00:52:50,359
Speaker 1: The way they animate him having to pee is one of the funnier things I've seen in my life.

922
00:52:50,721 --> 00:52:51,768
Speaker 0: Didn't he turn into animals?

923
00:52:51,789 --> 00:52:53,380
Speaker 0: couldn't he just turn into a dog and piss in a corner?

924
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:57,119
Speaker 1: Well, so he just does piss in the corner, but he doesn't turn into anything.

925
00:52:57,882 --> 00:52:59,808
Speaker 1: I thought why didn't he turn into like a bird?

926
00:52:59,848 --> 00:53:02,016
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then do what birds do?

927
00:53:02,377 --> 00:53:03,280
Speaker 0: just shit on everything.

928
00:53:03,421 --> 00:53:05,429
Speaker 1: Yes, let it go works that way.

929
00:53:05,449 --> 00:53:07,940
Speaker 1: I think he has to pee like the people come with him.

930
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:08,182
Speaker 1: I don't.

931
00:53:08,222 --> 00:53:08,424
Speaker 1: I like.

932
00:53:08,464 --> 00:53:14,056
Speaker 0: I don't know because he doesn't transform He just pees he turned into a littler bird with the pee amount.

933
00:53:14,076 --> 00:53:14,860
Speaker 0: stay the same.

934
00:53:15,262 --> 00:53:18,279
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's that's the kind of question that keeps me up at night.

00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:21,047
