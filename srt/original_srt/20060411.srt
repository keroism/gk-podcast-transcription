1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,486
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday April 11th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:25,207
Speaker 0: We talked about Tetris DS But you're gonna have to wade through a whole bunch of other stuff We talked about until you get to it, so if you only want to hear about Tetris fast forward now Let's do this.

3
00:00:26,253 --> 00:00:34,147
Speaker 1: Well before we actually get into the news and the show and all that as we usually do we have some meta type things to Say, but they're somewhat unorthodox today.

4
00:00:35,032 --> 00:00:36,038
Speaker 0: Unorthodox you say.

5
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:38,350
Speaker 0: could they possibly be conservative or reform?

6
00:00:39,852 --> 00:00:41,217
Speaker 0: Or maybe they're more than Orthodox.

7
00:00:41,237 --> 00:00:41,820
Speaker 0: They're Hasidic.

8
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:42,944
Speaker 1: All right.

9
00:00:42,985 --> 00:00:44,250
Speaker 1: That was not funny which is?

10
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:46,977
Speaker 0: You don't know who the bubbishes are?

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:47,761
Speaker 1: no.

12
00:00:47,902 --> 00:00:48,263
Speaker 1: I don't.

13
00:00:48,605 --> 00:00:49,690
Speaker 0: I'll explain it to you sometime.

14
00:00:50,192 --> 00:00:52,601
Speaker 0: Okay, they're like the craziest of Jews.

15
00:00:52,782 --> 00:01:02,330
Speaker 0: the love of it is okay, all right All right, so as I said yesterday, and I'm gonna say every day this week of course I'm gonna explain it a lot less than I explained it yesterday.

16
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:08,290
Speaker 0: The forum sends you an email when we approve your membership to the forum unlike other forums.

17
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,110
Speaker 0: So you're immediately automatically approved.

18
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:22,340
Speaker 0: However some people have spam filters and those spam filters are blocking the email and as a result There are many people who have applied for membership to our forums who have been accepted and they've never come back.

19
00:01:23,213 --> 00:01:30,345
Speaker 0: If you never come back because you're not listening anymore well You're not listening anymore if you haven't come back because you didn't get an email saying you were approved.

20
00:01:30,405 --> 00:01:32,010
Speaker 0: guess what you got approved.

21
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,278
Speaker 0: Come and sign into the forums and have fun.

22
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:35,844
Speaker 1: We've never turned anyone away.

23
00:01:35,905 --> 00:01:36,166
Speaker 1: yet.

24
00:01:36,386 --> 00:01:44,610
Speaker 0: not yet however One person who he did this call yesterday the flaming geek or the flaming geek or now.

25
00:01:44,751 --> 00:01:48,137
Speaker 1: I'll warn you right now This is not something we're going to do often now.

26
00:01:48,417 --> 00:02:04,285
Speaker 1: those of you who've been listening long enough know that we're very intolerant of certain things Namely a pseudoscience Scientologists lying Stupidity in general bad grammar yeah All those sorts of things.

27
00:02:04,345 --> 00:02:08,079
Speaker 0: well We're opinionated for this and background information.

28
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:14,349
Speaker 0: someone applied to the forums a long time ago named like the flaming geek or whatever And I approved them, and they never showed up.

29
00:02:15,452 --> 00:02:26,195
Speaker 0: Of course I'm pretty sure it was due to the email problem because they applied again a few weeks later and I approved their second account and Okay They still didn't show up.

30
00:02:26,857 --> 00:02:29,104
Speaker 0: then I discovered the email problem and yesterday.

31
00:02:29,365 --> 00:02:36,241
Speaker 0: I made the announcement on the show and today The flaming geek signed into his account and started posting.

32
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:37,626
Speaker 1: now at first we thought all right.

33
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:38,649
Speaker 1: a new member to the forum.

34
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:39,857
Speaker 1: the forums Are growing very quickly.

35
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:48,990
Speaker 1: yep awesome now I hate to directly call someone out, but I'm very much a fan of calling people out, so I actually don't hate this at all.

36
00:02:49,998 --> 00:02:56,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, and After examining all the evidence there is only a point zero zero one percent doubt on our part.

37
00:02:56,831 --> 00:03:09,089
Speaker 1: So I guess I'll say this right now to the flaming geek if you can prove us wrong You will not only be interviewed on the show for being awesome But we'll probably give you some money and maybe some prizes.

38
00:03:09,852 --> 00:03:14,006
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the flaming geek you do not live in Japan.

39
00:03:14,026 --> 00:03:15,110
Speaker 0: it is painfully obvious.

40
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,943
Speaker 1: We are fairly certain that you live in or about Miami, Florida.

41
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:20,168
Speaker 0: your name is Juan.

42
00:03:21,152 --> 00:03:24,346
Speaker 0: We're pretty sure you are Hispanic, and you can't be old.

43
00:03:24,406 --> 00:03:25,350
Speaker 0: you you're either You.

44
00:03:25,993 --> 00:03:34,724
Speaker 0: you either grew up speaking Spanish and are very poor at English You or you are so young that you have not received sufficient education as to speak English pro.

45
00:03:34,865 --> 00:03:42,230
Speaker 1: or or there is the sophisticated answer that You're pretending to speak English poorly in order to bolster the image that you were living in Japan.

46
00:03:43,112 --> 00:03:51,458
Speaker 0: Or you just are the kind of kid who goes through school getting terrible grades, and you're not smart you don't study and yeah Yeah, Scott will really lay India.

47
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:53,850
Speaker 1: I'll do it slightly more civilly, but that's fine.

48
00:03:54,997 --> 00:03:55,909
Speaker 0: We could do a lot worse.

49
00:03:56,371 --> 00:04:02,010
Speaker 1: The fact remains that I was mostly tipped off when you didn't seem to understand Japanese when it was written in Romaji.

50
00:04:02,412 --> 00:04:17,209
Speaker 1: Yet you claim to be able to read it or type it in the actual Kanna But you can't speak it or know what it sounds like which is really odd to me because Japanese is Really syllable based and the sounds and yeah, yeah.

51
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,099
Speaker 0: now Here's a hint for people who want to lie about something.

52
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:22,146
Speaker 0: don't be Samira Gupta.

53
00:04:22,186 --> 00:04:26,710
Speaker 1: We will tell Samira Oh my god, Samira Gupta is like my favorite guy ever.

54
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,542
Speaker 0: We will tell the story of Samira Gupta in a future episode of geek night.

55
00:04:30,622 --> 00:04:39,150
Speaker 1: suffice to say he has for at least Seven or eight years then living a charade a lie on the internet of epic proportions.

56
00:04:39,796 --> 00:04:41,050
Speaker 0: I'm gonna say it in one sentence.

57
00:04:41,331 --> 00:04:49,042
Speaker 0: He goes on slash dot and pretends that he worked for every video game company ever When he of course has never worked for a video and game company ever.

58
00:04:49,103 --> 00:04:51,634
Speaker 1: now the scary thing isn't that people believe this dude Cuz.

59
00:04:51,654 --> 00:04:53,708
Speaker 1: no one believes this dude, they'll be a lot of people do.

60
00:04:53,729 --> 00:04:55,034
Speaker 0: well No people don't believe him.

61
00:04:55,155 --> 00:05:02,447
Speaker 0: over time people believe like they see one post and like and it one post looks good But over every soon as you point out this guy is a history of lying.

62
00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:03,431
Speaker 0: people like oh He's now.

63
00:05:03,451 --> 00:05:14,924
Speaker 1: the scary thing is that if you search on usenet you find a guy posting like in the early 90s Under the same name making the same kinds of claims either.

64
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:17,292
Speaker 0: It's a conspiracy or it's one, dude We don't know.

65
00:05:17,373 --> 00:05:18,317
Speaker 0: but that's for another episode.

66
00:05:18,397 --> 00:05:19,241
Speaker 1: I think it's like Zorro.

67
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,708
Speaker 1: He just passes the mantle on.

68
00:05:20,728 --> 00:05:21,050
Speaker 0: it could be.

69
00:05:21,191 --> 00:05:30,499
Speaker 0: The point is is that if you're going to lie about something like let's say I wanted to lie about being from Japan on a forum somewhere right number one I would learn a lot about Japan.

70
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:44,210
Speaker 0: before I said anything about Japan I would look it up and make sure I was saying accurate stuff and that if anyone tried to challenge me by saying You know name all the prefectures of Japan or name the adjacent prefectures, or what street do you live on?

71
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,069
Speaker 0: I would be I would have that shit down.

72
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:51,751
Speaker 0: You know don't you watch enough movies with this like Hannibal and stuff, and he gets everything perfect You know.

73
00:05:51,832 --> 00:05:57,090
Speaker 0: yeah, well Hannibal was a transhumanist, so yeah - don't keep mentioning it.

74
00:05:57,271 --> 00:05:59,706
Speaker 0: I mean he posted on the frapper map that he was in Tokyo.

75
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:02,319
Speaker 0: all right He posted in his profile.

76
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,887
Speaker 0: He's in Tokyo or Japan?

77
00:06:04,188 --> 00:06:04,490
Speaker 0: all right.

78
00:06:05,012 --> 00:06:08,647
Speaker 0: He said in his post you know about himself that he was from Japan.

79
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:09,129
Speaker 0: all right.

80
00:06:09,672 --> 00:06:12,484
Speaker 0: Then it seems like half his posts are like yeah, I'm in Japan.

81
00:06:12,504 --> 00:06:13,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm having trouble with Japanese keyboard.

82
00:06:14,231 --> 00:06:16,640
Speaker 0: Oh my god, isn't so crazy that it's so late here yet.

83
00:06:16,681 --> 00:06:17,423
Speaker 0: I'm still posting.

84
00:06:17,704 --> 00:06:19,069
Speaker 0: He said that like two or three times.

85
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:23,202
Speaker 0: Then he doesn't know what someone means and they say kawaii doesn't a.

86
00:06:23,543 --> 00:06:25,027
Speaker 1: yeah that really got me there.

87
00:06:25,348 --> 00:06:28,959
Speaker 1: Yeah You're gonna lie.

88
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,550
Speaker 0: you gotta be on top of your shit.

89
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:41,450
Speaker 1: Yep number three if you're going to lie about something and for whatever internet reason you know fake online persona You've really gotta not make too many extraordinary claims all at once.

90
00:06:41,931 --> 00:06:46,082
Speaker 1: I mean born in London moved to Miami then moved to Tokyo.

91
00:06:46,222 --> 00:06:49,089
Speaker 1: all right tiny-ass little apartment in Tokyo.

92
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:52,335
Speaker 1: all right Terrible English grammar.

93
00:06:52,395 --> 00:06:57,850
Speaker 1: yet you and you use a Japanese OS and yet you don't know spoken Japanese.

94
00:06:58,671 --> 00:07:03,449
Speaker 1: Alright a short dude buys you groceries every week, and you don't understand him.

95
00:07:04,594 --> 00:07:09,870
Speaker 0: You don't leave your apartment And you have some contract with some job that you can't talk about.

96
00:07:10,233 --> 00:07:12,050
Speaker 0: That requires you to stay in this little apartment.

97
00:07:12,151 --> 00:07:19,449
Speaker 1: But yet you can say that you have the job with the contract that you're not allowed to talk about But you can't talk about it, and then you bring up the fact that you can't talk about it.

98
00:07:20,132 --> 00:07:24,870
Speaker 0: It's obviously a poorly not so well thought through made-up story by a little kid.

99
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:36,290
Speaker 1: Also, I would point out that if you're gonna lie about something like this Someone's gonna trace your IP address at some point, and I traced your IP address to the area of Miami, Florida.

100
00:07:36,793 --> 00:07:40,270
Speaker 0: Now you might make up some story like oh my roommate did something or whatever.

101
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:47,085
Speaker 0: But first of all you said you live in a little tiny box and second of all There is no way you could have a Miami IP address in Japan.

102
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:47,948
Speaker 0: no none.

103
00:07:47,988 --> 00:07:48,631
Speaker 1: well There's.

104
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:49,293
Speaker 1: there's one way.

105
00:07:49,876 --> 00:08:05,010
Speaker 1: if he had someone in the u.s.. Who is on Bell South DSL because like my grandma my grandma's on Bell South the run an HTTP proxy for you, and then you connect to that and then from there connect to the rest of the internet.

106
00:08:06,072 --> 00:08:07,198
Speaker 0: That is possible.

107
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:09,310
Speaker 0: that is possible however ludicrous.

108
00:08:09,751 --> 00:08:14,145
Speaker 0: It is so ludicrous that if anyone actually were to set that up.

109
00:08:14,446 --> 00:08:15,249
Speaker 0: I would pay you a dollar.

110
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:22,710
Speaker 1: Really really all right, I'll set one up tonight for Emily who's currently in Japan.

111
00:08:23,272 --> 00:08:26,906
Speaker 0: You have to set it up on Bell South in Florida for someone in Japan.

112
00:08:27,247 --> 00:08:28,110
Speaker 1: Bell South in Florida.

113
00:08:28,171 --> 00:08:29,590
Speaker 1: Why not Comcast up here in Beacon?

114
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:31,714
Speaker 0: We don't have Comcast.

115
00:08:31,755 --> 00:08:35,013
Speaker 1: We have oh yeah, whatever we have we have C star Online.

116
00:08:35,053 --> 00:08:55,448
Speaker 0: yeah, yeah All right, so Fleming geek Either you have to post on the forum with Sufficient evidence to convince two people who are much smarter than you that you are actually in Japan as well as many many people Who know a lot more about Japan than you seem to know.

117
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:55,710
Speaker 1: yes?

118
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:01,110
Speaker 0: I mean including people we know in person that are Japanese people that speak Japanese.

119
00:09:01,251 --> 00:09:04,788
Speaker 1: Or how about the fact that Emily is currently living in Japan right now?

120
00:09:04,849 --> 00:09:09,548
Speaker 1: in fact I talked to her over Skype last night right Emily who's been on the show before.

121
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:24,130
Speaker 0: so Unless you can prove to us with some sort of forum post that you all your claims of Japan are actually correct Um You're going to be ridiculed a great deal, so if you're a mature intelligent person you will come clean.

122
00:09:24,412 --> 00:09:25,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you come clean, that's fine.

123
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,290
Speaker 1: I mean we're not gonna ban you or anything.

124
00:09:27,552 --> 00:09:28,338
Speaker 1: We want you to listen.

125
00:09:28,398 --> 00:09:29,769
Speaker 1: just uh don't lie to us.

126
00:09:30,232 --> 00:09:33,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, because um and this is a note to everyone else out there listening to geek nights.

127
00:09:34,271 --> 00:09:39,318
Speaker 0: We're the last people on earth that you can fool Like we don't want to sound like we're can.

128
00:09:39,358 --> 00:09:42,210
Speaker 0: well no no we're not the last people on earth that you can fool.

129
00:09:42,531 --> 00:09:44,436
Speaker 0: It would be it would be harder to fool.

130
00:09:44,516 --> 00:09:46,863
Speaker 0: perhaps James Randi possibly you could.

131
00:09:46,883 --> 00:09:58,427
Speaker 1: there could be a fooling a con That could get us, but Randi would point out that we've gotten to the point when we'll Disbelieve something that is true longer than most people would have disbelieved it.

132
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:04,205
Speaker 1: yes We disbelieve just about anything and everything we see and any claim anyone makes.

133
00:10:04,245 --> 00:10:08,183
Speaker 0: that is not completely mundane But you know what we seem to be always right.

134
00:10:08,726 --> 00:10:09,329
Speaker 0: What's up with that?

135
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,255
Speaker 1: Not always 90%.

136
00:10:12,255 --> 00:10:16,969
Speaker 0: I wasn't right about a frickin Boulder Hill Boulder Mountain yeah, but that's a stupid thing.

137
00:10:16,989 --> 00:10:21,705
Speaker 1: I Am proud that I was right about the Korea thing even though I see the thing is is you?

138
00:10:21,926 --> 00:10:23,397
Speaker 0: I was I was in the Right on that one.

139
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:24,570
Speaker 0: you guys are arguing about it.

140
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:28,274
Speaker 0: So I said I'm gonna fucking look it up, and I found a picture of the thing and I'm like well There's the answer yeah,

141
00:10:28,374 --> 00:10:30,767
Speaker 1: I was gonna, and then you beat me to it, and I saw it was like oh,

00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:31,892
Speaker 0: yeah Oh,

143
00:10:31,912 --> 00:10:32,675
Speaker 1: you know what came out of it.

144
00:10:33,096 --> 00:10:37,150
Speaker 1: I've discovered that my mask toys are worth well over a thousand dollars.

145
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:39,765
Speaker 0: Well, it's time to convert some useless pieces of plastic.

146
00:10:39,785 --> 00:10:41,453
Speaker 1: They're awesome I want to keep.

147
00:10:41,614 --> 00:10:45,730
Speaker 1: well the thing is you want to keep useless pieces of plastic instead of converting them into useful gadgets.

148
00:10:46,031 --> 00:10:48,520
Speaker 1: Um I point out one that you have a lot of useless pieces of plastic.

149
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:51,491
Speaker 0: those useless pieces of plastic cannot be converted into useful Gadgets.

150
00:10:51,511 --> 00:10:56,469
Speaker 1: - more importantly I have two of every mask toy with a few exceptions.

151
00:10:57,133 --> 00:10:58,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, well older hills.

152
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,130
Speaker 0: and yet you still thought they were called Boulder Mountain.

153
00:11:00,653 --> 00:11:08,810
Speaker 1: Uh yeah, actually someone posted that that in the German dub It was called Boulder Mountain, but and the thing is I found out that one Wikipedia said Boulder Mountain.

154
00:11:09,232 --> 00:11:10,158
Speaker 1: So did half the internet.

155
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:17,730
Speaker 0: I edited Wikipedia to be correct But anyway my stance on the issue is that when they were making this show and they said huh?

156
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:18,894
Speaker 0: What do we call this base?

157
00:11:18,934 --> 00:11:19,054
Speaker 0: Well?

158
00:11:19,074 --> 00:11:21,423
Speaker 0: It's a mountain hill thing, but what should we call it?

159
00:11:21,925 --> 00:11:23,270
Speaker 0: I know we'll call it Boulder Hill.

160
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:28,301
Speaker 0: Do we call it Boulder Mountain, maybe no Boulder Hill sounds better.

161
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:39,737
Speaker 0: Boulder Mountain sounds a billion times better than Boulder Hill Any other human on earth would have but given a choice between Boulder Hill and Boulder Mountain We would have chosen Boulder Mountain immediately.

162
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:42,768
Speaker 0: What is wrong with these stupid mask show?

163
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:43,390
Speaker 0: make a guy.

164
00:11:43,672 --> 00:11:44,901
Speaker 1: You know what was awesome about mask?

165
00:11:45,102 --> 00:11:50,204
Speaker 1: it had some of the best toys ever And hence the fact that they go for a lot of money to the transform.

166
00:11:50,465 --> 00:11:51,590
Speaker 0: Yes, you need to transfer.

167
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,374
Speaker 0: Do they combine?

168
00:11:52,856 --> 00:11:54,042
Speaker 1: some of them do all right.

169
00:11:54,082 --> 00:11:58,638
Speaker 0: you need transformation and kind of Most important aspects of any toe.

170
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,244
Speaker 1: every one of them comes with dudes.

171
00:12:00,545 --> 00:12:04,543
Speaker 1: the dudes have big Masks with powers that go on and off very well.

172
00:12:04,563 --> 00:12:08,101
Speaker 1: the dudes are articulated And they're all perfectly interchangeable.

173
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:09,709
Speaker 1: like everything interacts with everything.

174
00:12:10,518 --> 00:12:11,326
Speaker 0: All right like Lego.

175
00:12:11,488 --> 00:12:19,526
Speaker 1: also I'll point out that if you had the Ninja Turtles technodrome It is the best base for masked men ever far and far and above Boulder Hill.

176
00:12:19,747 --> 00:12:20,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't have a technodrome.

177
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:21,980
Speaker 0: I had Thundercat.

178
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,451
Speaker 1: my masked man lived in my Technodrome.

179
00:12:24,592 --> 00:12:26,622
Speaker 0: I had a late siege to Boulder Hill.

180
00:12:26,682 --> 00:12:28,270
Speaker 0: yeah, the Thundercats lair is awesome.

181
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,940
Speaker 0: I had a little the headlights in the head.

182
00:12:30,061 --> 00:12:31,167
Speaker 1: Oh, I always wanted that.

183
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:31,590
Speaker 0: I have it.

184
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,134
Speaker 0: It's in my attic.

185
00:12:32,154 --> 00:12:32,738
Speaker 0: you want to go get it.

186
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,410
Speaker 1: We should get all our toys and play with them.

187
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,354
Speaker 0: I could bring it here.

188
00:12:35,374 --> 00:12:36,218
Speaker 0: I think I'm going home.

189
00:12:36,318 --> 00:12:37,584
Speaker 1: Yeah, you get a picture of that.

190
00:12:37,725 --> 00:12:38,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, have you awesome alright?

191
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,281
Speaker 0: It's in the attic though alright.

192
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,270
Speaker 1: That's enough meta bits.

193
00:12:41,712 --> 00:12:43,342
Speaker 1: We have some actual news now.

194
00:12:43,523 --> 00:12:48,870
Speaker 1: Scott's news is a little old But we've been talking about it the two of us pretty much quite a bit for the last week.

195
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:50,161
Speaker 1: So we have to talk about it.

196
00:12:50,201 --> 00:12:53,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is sort of a rant I've got about Star Wars kid.

197
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,599
Speaker 1: yeah now if you remember Scott's rant about Singapore It'll probably be similar.

198
00:12:57,619 --> 00:12:59,670
Speaker 0: it might be a little longer and less yelling.

199
00:13:00,051 --> 00:13:01,516
Speaker 1: Yeah, I want to do mine.

200
00:13:01,556 --> 00:13:05,146
Speaker 1: first my news because it's kind of sensational and it's actually kind of current.

201
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:06,310
Speaker 0: all right all right.

202
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,104
Speaker 1: So dig had an article.

203
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:08,870
Speaker 1: What was it yesterday?

204
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:15,328
Speaker 1: That the PlayStation 3. the headline of the article was that the PlayStation 3 is not going to be playable at e3.

205
00:13:15,348 --> 00:13:15,368
Speaker 1: I?

206
00:13:16,892 --> 00:13:20,084
Speaker 1: Read that headline and thought wow Sony's fucked.

207
00:13:20,405 --> 00:13:33,790
Speaker 1: That's the end of that company It's over mm-hmm, and then I laughed hysterically for like 10 minutes mm-hmm, then we clicked on the article and I discovered that dig is perhaps the most sensationalistic news outlet in the world.

208
00:13:34,354 --> 00:13:35,443
Speaker 0: I don't know what's wrong with.

209
00:13:35,463 --> 00:13:41,666
Speaker 0: it used to be that Occasionally some article on dig would have a crazy headline And it would get a bunch of digs and show up on the front page.

210
00:13:42,109 --> 00:13:54,633
Speaker 0: now It seems that any article about anything of import the headline I mean sure when you were trying to summarize an entire article of information into a single sentence or just a few words It's easy.

211
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:57,663
Speaker 0: It's quite difficult to include all the details.

212
00:13:57,683 --> 00:13:57,864
Speaker 1: Yes.

213
00:13:57,884 --> 00:14:00,672
Speaker 1: It's also easy to imply things Unintentionally.

214
00:14:00,853 --> 00:14:09,082
Speaker 0: it is easy to imply things unintentionally, but the magnitude to which the headlines on dig Part doesn't even come close.

215
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:15,923
Speaker 0: Yeah completely falsify and Mislead people as to what the articles actually contain.

216
00:14:15,963 --> 00:14:22,029
Speaker 0: and then even the paragraphs of Description under the headline or even worse they don't help you at all.

217
00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:22,310
Speaker 1: Scott.

218
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,170
Speaker 1: We're either one saying that dig is a better than slash.

219
00:14:25,852 --> 00:14:33,015
Speaker 0: It gets that if you actually just read the stories and only use the headlines to figure out generally Gonna do that.

220
00:14:33,095 --> 00:14:35,890
Speaker 1: you might as well use FARC because it has everything on digging more.

221
00:14:36,231 --> 00:14:37,234
Speaker 0: Yeah, it doesn't have everything.

222
00:14:37,274 --> 00:14:37,475
Speaker 0: I did.

223
00:14:37,495 --> 00:14:39,402
Speaker 0: a lot of times people dig other stuff like.

224
00:14:39,843 --> 00:14:48,750
Speaker 1: I've never seen something that was on dig that Didn't also hit FARC in a within a reasonable span of time and honestly the FARC headlines are usually much more accurate.

225
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,457
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, and also humorous.

226
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:59,255
Speaker 1: I think the problem with dig is that they people see that headline They go holy shit, and they dig it and then you know the next day They read the article.

227
00:14:59,577 --> 00:15:02,272
Speaker 1: if they even look at the article uh-huh I think a lot.

228
00:15:02,332 --> 00:15:19,136
Speaker 0: I think I don't think people seem to read articles at all like RTF a. yeah We should do some sort of study like we find the people who actually read articles and then we get those people together and all the people don't actually read articles and we see like we watch their link farm just Like continue to grow.

229
00:15:19,156 --> 00:15:22,812
Speaker 0: if you were just linking to things without looking at them all over the place Crazy,

230
00:15:22,972 --> 00:15:33,647
Speaker 1: but anyway there was a tiny tiny grain of truth in the middle of the sea of lie and the truth Is that the ps3 is not really gonna have a big show at e3.

231
00:15:33,707 --> 00:15:34,270
Speaker 1: most likely.

232
00:15:34,812 --> 00:15:38,490
Speaker 0: Do you remember the show for the revolution at the last e3 where they had it behind?

233
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:49,868
Speaker 1: Like a curtain and you couldn't go in there and only a few people got invited to play with some cheap demos or like the PSP At the last one when there was like one and they'd let like people come back and look at it.

234
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:54,309
Speaker 0: Yep That's what the ps3 is gonna be like at e3 in a month or so.

235
00:15:54,651 --> 00:15:59,815
Speaker 1: Yeah, if all of this is be to believed which honestly I believe it because once again I work for the frickin company making the chips.

236
00:16:00,076 --> 00:16:04,750
Speaker 0: However, the revolution will have you know booths everywhere.

237
00:16:04,911 --> 00:16:08,125
Speaker 0: The Nintendo booth will be full of revolution stuff crazy crazy go nuts.

238
00:16:08,265 --> 00:16:09,250
Speaker 0: People are gonna be playing it.

239
00:16:09,451 --> 00:16:13,110
Speaker 0: There's probably just gonna be huge lines around the hall of e3 waiting to play with revolutions.

240
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:27,930
Speaker 1: Yep, I don't want to sound like a fanboy and I don't I. I really have no like Nintendo fanboy leanings behind my following statement But I really believe that Nintendo is going to regain the top position in consoles in this generation.

241
00:16:28,351 --> 00:16:30,197
Speaker 0: The DS is the new SNES.

242
00:16:30,558 --> 00:16:30,879
Speaker 1: Yes.

243
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,648
Speaker 1: I mean seriously the DS alone right now.

244
00:16:33,788 --> 00:16:36,580
Speaker 0: Oh my god It just came to me metal Marines DS.

245
00:16:36,982 --> 00:16:37,685
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

246
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:41,349
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah We'll talk about that another day.

247
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:46,150
Speaker 1: If you remember the game metal Marines post in the forum that game is awesome and we want to try to remake it.

248
00:16:46,391 --> 00:16:48,579
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have a vision metal Marines DS.

249
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:49,924
Speaker 1: Oh, that's a good vision.

250
00:16:50,084 --> 00:16:51,228
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm with you on that vision.

251
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:52,115
Speaker 1: I see it I see it.

252
00:16:52,418 --> 00:16:57,079
Speaker 0: Yep, but But you should talk about the vision inside.

253
00:16:57,239 --> 00:16:59,387
Speaker 1: actually someone noticed the vision inside.

254
00:16:59,427 --> 00:17:00,170
Speaker 1: joke and post.

255
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,782
Speaker 0: I think that was actually the flaming game.

256
00:17:02,487 --> 00:17:04,372
Speaker 0: I don't know I don't know who it was It might have been.

257
00:17:04,392 --> 00:17:11,118
Speaker 0: the story of the vision is simply this we used to play Mario Party hardcore Like as in we had the World Championship belts.

258
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,804
Speaker 0: Yeah, we didn't have them.

259
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:14,489
Speaker 1: But the people of course, we didn't have a loss.

260
00:17:15,011 --> 00:17:24,508
Speaker 0: Well our friends they we what we played Mario Party hardcore and they had you know, the the toy wrestling bells from Toys R Us and whoever won would get the belts.

261
00:17:24,568 --> 00:17:29,083
Speaker 0: now The one guy we played with and I forget his name.

262
00:17:29,344 --> 00:17:44,880
Speaker 0: I remember it but not gonna say it What he would do is he would get the poison mushrooms and create the row of death and he would just make a row of Poison mushrooms so that if you ever got around the board to this port to this point You pretty much had to land on.

263
00:17:44,921 --> 00:17:46,750
Speaker 0: a poison mushroom is basically the poison mushroom.

264
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,149
Speaker 1: If you don't know this game makes it so you really can't move very far.

265
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:52,329
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if there's a whole bunch of them you keep hitting them and you just get stuck here.

266
00:17:52,711 --> 00:17:56,583
Speaker 0: Yep, so whenever anyone got a poison mushroom, he was like my vision.

267
00:17:56,824 --> 00:17:58,630
Speaker 0: you must make my vision become reality.

268
00:17:59,615 --> 00:18:00,588
Speaker 1: The vision became a thing.

269
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:05,369
Speaker 0: Yes The vision became a thing and we had rows and rows of poison mushrooms in every Mario Party.

270
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,140
Speaker 1: now We have another Mario Party story that I'm saving for another day.

271
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,485
Speaker 1: Hooray the bamboo.

272
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,810
Speaker 0: Oh the bamboo.

273
00:18:12,531 --> 00:18:25,555
Speaker 1: We we are fairly invulnerable to many forces in this world But the one force that took us down as a unit as in we were routed was a tiny Three inch tall piece of bamboo.

274
00:18:26,157 --> 00:18:27,019
Speaker 0: So Star Wars kid.

275
00:18:27,521 --> 00:18:28,503
Speaker 1: All right Star Wars kid.

276
00:18:28,523 --> 00:18:29,426
Speaker 1: This is Scott's rant.

277
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:41,742
Speaker 0: I will interject periodically Alright, so for those of you don't know Star Wars kid is that kid who made a video of himself swinging a broomstick around Pretending to be all Jedi and then he left it in the equipment.

278
00:18:41,762 --> 00:18:44,030
Speaker 1: He recorded it which happened to be in school.

279
00:18:44,371 --> 00:18:47,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, he recorded it on some like a V Club video camera.

280
00:18:47,842 --> 00:18:50,149
Speaker 0: some other kids found it and put it on the net.

281
00:18:51,013 --> 00:18:55,130
Speaker 0: It became an overnight sensation like Numa Numa sized crazy.

282
00:18:56,414 --> 00:19:10,767
Speaker 0: so The kid who did the Star Wars kid, you know the the Star Wars kid He wasn't so happy because he was uh, you know Nerd a fat dopey kid who didn't have any friends and no life and got picked on.

283
00:19:10,807 --> 00:19:14,560
Speaker 0: and all that Of course after he became Star Wars kid.

284
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:18,613
Speaker 0: what started happening is kids Bothered him about it.

285
00:19:19,235 --> 00:19:20,178
Speaker 0: It's it's only natural.

286
00:19:20,238 --> 00:19:23,307
Speaker 0: He goes into school and kids are like hey Star Wars kid.

287
00:19:23,327 --> 00:19:29,869
Speaker 0: Whoo I think one of the stories is that in one class they took the overhead projector and they were writing stuff on it.

288
00:19:30,271 --> 00:19:42,172
Speaker 0: So they started sliding the piece of plastic with the writing on it up the overhead projector and go and the whole class is like Now

289
00:19:42,192 --> 00:19:54,729
Speaker 1: I just like to say at this point that if that were me and I had that level of fame suddenly Like that does the level of fame to the point that everyone on the internet everyone on Fark at least know who I was.

290
00:19:55,772 --> 00:20:00,017
Speaker 1: I would be all over that shit like a fanboy on something.

291
00:20:00,078 --> 00:20:10,869
Speaker 0: fanboys like some nudie Sculptures, I don't know life-size naked anime chicks, whatever fanboys disgust me anyway.

292
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,255
Speaker 0: So what happened recent?

293
00:20:13,275 --> 00:20:14,760
Speaker 1: Well, we're just kind of mean-spirited today.

294
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,221
Speaker 0: We are.

295
00:20:15,302 --> 00:20:17,148
Speaker 0: it's it's mean day here on geek night.

296
00:20:17,168 --> 00:20:20,276
Speaker 1: Yes Well, we won't like it.

297
00:20:20,316 --> 00:20:22,041
Speaker 1: So we're all surly and physical today.

298
00:20:22,282 --> 00:20:23,124
Speaker 0: Yeah, watch out.

299
00:20:23,566 --> 00:20:24,750
Speaker 0: You don't want to get near us geeks.

300
00:20:25,794 --> 00:20:29,510
Speaker 0: I guess that's what daily podcast is, you know, the mood changes from day to day.

301
00:20:30,192 --> 00:20:33,541
Speaker 0: Anyway, Star Wars kid what happened was recently.

302
00:20:34,042 --> 00:20:36,810
Speaker 0: he sued the three kids who put the video on the internet.

303
00:20:37,472 --> 00:20:44,543
Speaker 0: Now if he would have sued them for say copyright infringement, you know I made that video and you distributed it without my permission.

304
00:20:44,925 --> 00:20:48,585
Speaker 0: I would have been like, all right I don't like copyright law, but at least that's legitimate.

305
00:20:48,685 --> 00:20:49,329
Speaker 0: I can live with that.

306
00:20:49,912 --> 00:20:52,986
Speaker 0: No, he sued them for making him upset and picking on him.

307
00:20:53,388 --> 00:21:15,009
Speaker 0: now I gotta say if someone picks on you by say beating you up or stealing your lunch money or like harassing you in a real dangerous threatening or like damaging way or you know sexually harassing you or You know that sort of thing.

308
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:17,956
Speaker 1: Yeah racial things anything that's like like there's.

309
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:26,790
Speaker 1: there's an obvious line and people might debate about the exact position of the line but everyone agrees That there's a line between good-natured bullying and dangerous bullying.

310
00:21:26,991 --> 00:21:35,637
Speaker 0: The line for me is when you infringe upon the rights of another human being people have rights and if you infringe upon the rights Of someone else then that's not okay.

311
00:21:35,998 --> 00:21:38,628
Speaker 1: So I guess seeing Star Wars kid in the street and going a Star Wars kid.

312
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:46,687
Speaker 1: Haha That's okay Go into his house and like egging it or you know yelling at through his window Star Wars kid.

313
00:21:46,727 --> 00:21:48,741
Speaker 1: Whoo, not okay Exactly.

314
00:21:49,327 --> 00:21:58,248
Speaker 0: So According to all the evidence that I've read and all the stories I've read these three kids all they really did was Put this video on the internet.

315
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:00,918
Speaker 0: That doesn't cross the line for me.

316
00:22:00,978 --> 00:22:03,807
Speaker 0: That's you know, first of all, I'm against copyrights.

317
00:22:03,827 --> 00:22:04,690
Speaker 0: That's freedom of speech.

318
00:22:05,253 --> 00:22:07,950
Speaker 0: You're taking art and you're distributing it, you know.

319
00:22:08,131 --> 00:22:18,866
Speaker 0: And even if they had you know sung the Star Wars song in school or been like hey Star Wars kid And like, you know, you know said things to him that's freedom of speech.

320
00:22:18,886 --> 00:22:19,809
Speaker 0: you're saying things.

321
00:22:20,352 --> 00:22:25,073
Speaker 0: They're not saying fire in a crowded theater, you know the classic example You're.

322
00:22:25,153 --> 00:22:29,104
Speaker 0: I'm perfectly within my rights to say rim you suck cocks in hell.

323
00:22:29,565 --> 00:22:30,367
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know it.

324
00:22:31,069 --> 00:22:44,190
Speaker 0: so the difference here is that Star Wars kid is upset not because of anything anyone else did because that's what people always try to do with bullies is they try to say the Bully's the bad guy and the Star Wars kid is the victim.

325
00:22:44,691 --> 00:22:45,775
Speaker 0: Well, sometimes that's true.

326
00:22:45,815 --> 00:22:51,352
Speaker 0: if the guy's beating him up or crossing the line as we generally say that probably more than half the time That's true.

327
00:22:51,432 --> 00:22:53,198
Speaker 1: Just because of the nature of the bullying.

328
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:56,890
Speaker 1: I've seen kids and under cake these days, but yeah, that's a whole different show.

329
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,958
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you want to argue, you know, it's it's.

330
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:02,050
Speaker 0: I'd agree with you that most bullies seem to cross the line a lot.

331
00:23:02,251 --> 00:23:06,227
Speaker 0: However, we have no evidence that these guys cross the line and whether they did or not.

332
00:23:06,247 --> 00:23:06,950
Speaker 0: That's not my point.

333
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:22,230
Speaker 0: my point is in general if you don't cross that line and Some kid is being all upset because he's picked on but the bullies never crossed the line and they all they did was say stuff to him That's not the bully's fault.

334
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:27,669
Speaker 0: the bullies are doing things that they're perfectly allowed to do and in some cases should be encouraged to do.

335
00:23:27,689 --> 00:23:33,365
Speaker 0: and If you're Star Wars kidding you're upset because other people are doing things that they're allowed to do.

336
00:23:33,385 --> 00:23:34,830
Speaker 0: That's your fault.

337
00:23:35,292 --> 00:23:40,470
Speaker 0: It's your attitude that is causing you to be upset not some other kids putting a video on the internet.

338
00:23:41,273 --> 00:23:49,243
Speaker 0: if he had the attitude of being proud of being Star Wars kid instead of an attitude of being Ashamed of being Star Wars kid his life would be terrific.

339
00:23:49,664 --> 00:23:51,170
Speaker 1: or let's say he really couldn't deal with it.

340
00:23:51,311 --> 00:23:54,337
Speaker 1: And like that, maybe it wasn't over the line But it was close to the line or just it was.

341
00:23:54,357 --> 00:23:56,910
Speaker 1: it was getting to the point where is really affecting his life.

342
00:23:57,515 --> 00:24:04,190
Speaker 1: there are many steps between doing nothing and sucking it up and being miserable and Filing a lawsuit.

343
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,559
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean they're standing up to the bullies.

344
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:17,415
Speaker 1: if you can't do that, you know going to your parents and Talk, I think he did go to the parents The parents are the ones who did the lawsuit or going to the school I mean the school will usually.

345
00:24:17,475 --> 00:24:22,331
Speaker 1: well actually no I could have a whole rant about the way schools the schools don't deal with it Properly.

346
00:24:22,351 --> 00:24:22,733
Speaker 0: schools

347
00:24:22,773 --> 00:24:41,370
Speaker 1: deal with bullying and basically to sum this up schools nowadays, and I didn't really believe this But I've read so many articles lately where this happens schools will basically blame the victims of bullying now because the victims are more of a liability because when they get hurt or when something Happens the school is liable.

348
00:24:41,852 --> 00:24:47,469
Speaker 1: So they don't want to kick the bully out because then the bullies parents tend to also be That way and they'll sue the school.

349
00:24:47,871 --> 00:24:52,550
Speaker 1: They kick the victim out because the victim can't do anything and that way the school has no liability because no one's gonna get hurt.

350
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:54,938
Speaker 1: Yep, it's all bullshit.

351
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:56,764
Speaker 1: But that well again, that's a whole nother show.

352
00:24:56,985 --> 00:25:07,410
Speaker 0: The other thing is that Because of Star Wars kids attitude about being Star Wars kid He sort of brought it upon himself if he had had an attitude of being proud of being Star Wars kid.

353
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:10,363
Speaker 0: Eventually people would have just gotten used to it and forgotten about it.

354
00:25:10,865 --> 00:25:11,970
Speaker 0: See I learned this lesson.

355
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:14,217
Speaker 0: See people it seems to me like it started.

356
00:25:14,257 --> 00:25:18,674
Speaker 0: on slash dot people seem to be against me and on other websites people seem to Be with me.

357
00:25:18,694 --> 00:25:20,690
Speaker 1: Yeah FARC was mostly with you.

358
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,838
Speaker 0: I must say yeah and slash that was against me.

359
00:25:22,899 --> 00:25:30,588
Speaker 0: and it seemed to me that the people on slash that were against me or People who have been bullied as a kid and they felt they sympathized and empathized with Star Wars.

360
00:25:30,628 --> 00:25:31,817
Speaker 1: Yep, though I'll say right now.

361
00:25:31,918 --> 00:25:33,070
Speaker 1: I was bullied when I was a little kid.

362
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:34,697
Speaker 0: I was bullied when I was a little kid too.

363
00:25:34,757 --> 00:25:35,339
Speaker 0: And you know what.

364
00:25:35,962 --> 00:25:39,698
Speaker 0: around this time around some time Some kids started calling me mr.

365
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,706
Speaker 0: Bean because I look kind of like mr.

366
00:25:41,746 --> 00:25:41,907
Speaker 0: Bean.

367
00:25:41,927 --> 00:25:42,609
Speaker 0: Do I look like mr.

368
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:42,750
Speaker 0: Bean?

369
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,756
Speaker 1: I don't look like Rowan Atkinson a little bit.

370
00:25:44,836 --> 00:25:46,000
Speaker 0: All right, I didn't even know who mr.

371
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:46,562
Speaker 0: Bean was.

372
00:25:47,104 --> 00:25:54,567
Speaker 0: and these kids started going mr Bean and they were trying to make fun of me and I realized that that, you know, I didn't.

373
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:57,035
Speaker 0: it didn't bother me I was like whatever.

374
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:00,465
Speaker 0: and then it started, you know when they started calling me mr.

375
00:26:00,485 --> 00:26:00,706
Speaker 0: Bean.

376
00:26:00,746 --> 00:26:01,849
Speaker 0: I was like, what up?

377
00:26:03,531 --> 00:26:04,738
Speaker 0: That was that they called me mr.

378
00:26:04,758 --> 00:26:10,322
Speaker 0: Bean, but I didn't care I didn't get upset and They're trying to pick on me failed and that was that they didn't.

379
00:26:10,383 --> 00:26:11,287
Speaker 0: they never crossed the line.

380
00:26:11,307 --> 00:26:12,291
Speaker 0: All they did was call me Mr.

381
00:26:12,311 --> 00:26:19,273
Speaker 1: Bean, well, I guess what I'd like to say to kind of direct this toward not just a rant but actual useful advice or Something.

382
00:26:19,293 --> 00:26:26,588
Speaker 1: if you're bullied if people bully you in general I we have a number of bits of advice on how to deal with this.

383
00:26:26,809 --> 00:26:26,969
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

384
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:32,428
Speaker 1: Now the first thing is regardless of what you feel you have to be really objective about yourself and wonder why?

385
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:34,215
Speaker 1: Are people picking on me?

386
00:26:34,235 --> 00:26:35,501
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

387
00:26:35,682 --> 00:26:37,470
Speaker 1: You have to be kind of brutally honest with yourself.

388
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:38,873
Speaker 1: I mean It's one thing.

389
00:26:38,914 --> 00:26:44,949
Speaker 1: if people are picking on you because I don't know you're gay or black or some religious thing There's nothing you can do about that.

390
00:26:45,251 --> 00:26:49,487
Speaker 0: They have a right to be racist, but if they cross the line you get some police action or something.

391
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:54,250
Speaker 1: Yep Plus, you know, they have a right to be racist, but they also have a right to be assholes, right?

392
00:26:54,390 --> 00:27:05,230
Speaker 0: So let's say if I was black and there's a KKK guy walking down the street, you know But I had the same attitude that I do right now as being a not black person You know, I'd be like, that's fine.

393
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:10,290
Speaker 0: He can be in the KKK if he starts to burn crosses on my lawn that cross the line you call the police.

394
00:27:10,691 --> 00:27:25,229
Speaker 1: Yep, but you have to be brutally honest with yourself because if they're picking on you because you're fat and you're fat You should do something about that because it's not good to be fat anyway, and they might not be good for them to pick on you, but at the same time it's not good to be fat.

395
00:27:25,249 --> 00:27:40,730
Speaker 0: and Un-fatting will solve all of your problems exactly any at the very least if you can't un-fat because you have such low willpower Help get help or at the at the absolute minimum be proud of being fat.

396
00:27:40,931 --> 00:27:44,670
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't like people who are proud of being fat because it causes other problems in society.

397
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:48,320
Speaker 0: But at least you won't be unhappy or be a jolly fat guy.

398
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:48,902
Speaker 0: Who's cool.

399
00:27:49,182 --> 00:27:54,149
Speaker 0: Yeah, and not a slovenly disgusting fat guy You know or girl?

400
00:27:55,291 --> 00:28:01,030
Speaker 0: They're jolly fat people, you know, like those real happy fat people who are like, hey, what's up like fat Albert?

401
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,094
Speaker 0: You know, it's all cool.

402
00:28:02,396 --> 00:28:05,310
Speaker 1: Now a lot of kids seem to think oh, they're just jealous of me now.

403
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,840
Speaker 1: That may be true because I mean that happens but it does happen.

404
00:28:09,141 --> 00:28:12,310
Speaker 1: really think about yourself objectively and think all right.

405
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,254
Speaker 1: Is that really true?

406
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:16,930
Speaker 1: or am I just trying to make myself feel better about the fact that I'm actually Napoleon Dynamite?

407
00:28:17,411 --> 00:28:18,856
Speaker 0: Yeah, think about this.

408
00:28:18,896 --> 00:28:20,221
Speaker 0: You know, you have yours.

409
00:28:20,341 --> 00:28:22,890
Speaker 0: Let's say you're a smart kid and stupid kids pick on you, right?

410
00:28:23,532 --> 00:28:25,259
Speaker 0: Are they picking on the other smart kids?

411
00:28:25,561 --> 00:28:26,886
Speaker 0: Why have they singled out you?

412
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:29,535
Speaker 0: I mean Sure, they're bullies.

413
00:28:29,576 --> 00:28:32,526
Speaker 0: They got to find someone but why was it you?

414
00:28:32,566 --> 00:28:33,770
Speaker 0: they didn't pick you randomly.

415
00:28:34,152 --> 00:28:35,639
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not the Simpsons.

416
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,082
Speaker 0: They were.

417
00:28:36,102 --> 00:28:38,908
Speaker 0: they give off some odor bullies.

418
00:28:39,992 --> 00:28:42,180
Speaker 0: There's a reason that they picked you.

419
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:50,750
Speaker 0: you have some sort of personality Something about your personality that makes you a magnet to people picking on you.

420
00:28:51,071 --> 00:28:59,800
Speaker 0: You have to change it and if you change it you will live be much much happier and You won't need to go jump through hoops to make the bully stop.

421
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,381
Speaker 0: They're bad.

422
00:29:00,401 --> 00:29:03,449
Speaker 0: make them stop or stop and you know provoking them.

423
00:29:04,853 --> 00:29:05,518
Speaker 0: It's your fault too.

424
00:29:06,102 --> 00:29:06,263
Speaker 1: Now.

425
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:12,110
Speaker 1: The next step is Once you've realized why they're picking on you and you've decided whether or not you can do something about it.

426
00:29:12,897 --> 00:29:14,109
Speaker 1: You have to decide what you're going to do.

427
00:29:14,592 --> 00:29:23,210
Speaker 1: I mean if they're picking if it's people who are picking on you for no reason at all Like you really can't find a reason and they single you out exclusively and there's nothing else you can do.

428
00:29:24,033 --> 00:29:27,650
Speaker 1: I don't want to advocate violence, but if someone starts something finish it.

429
00:29:28,932 --> 00:29:30,741
Speaker 0: Here's another thing a piece of advice.

430
00:29:30,801 --> 00:29:32,449
Speaker 0: Let's say you're in a classroom, right?

431
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:36,164
Speaker 0: Not every single person in the classroom is bullying you.

432
00:29:36,204 --> 00:29:37,670
Speaker 0: that's a rare situation.

433
00:29:37,831 --> 00:29:43,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that means something either you're in a bad environment and you need to get out of there anyway, or something's wrong.

434
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:45,876
Speaker 0: Yes, something very wrong.

435
00:29:45,957 --> 00:29:48,144
Speaker 1: So usually what would happen is like how.

436
00:29:48,165 --> 00:29:49,088
Speaker 1: this is video game day.

437
00:29:49,228 --> 00:29:49,610
Speaker 0: I know right?

438
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,098
Speaker 0: We'll get to the video games.

439
00:29:51,118 --> 00:29:51,582
Speaker 0: Don't worry.

440
00:29:51,682 --> 00:29:52,126
Speaker 0: We're coming.

441
00:29:54,433 --> 00:29:56,028
Speaker 0: There are kids in the class we bullying you.

442
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:59,279
Speaker 0: Well people getting bullied and they'll be normal kids in the class.

443
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:13,519
Speaker 0: if you're being bullied right ask the normal kids Like, you know, seriously like hey, man, listen You're not bullied and I am and I really kind of want to know like Does anything?

444
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:27,030
Speaker 0: I do annoy you or You know because I can bet you there's at least one normal kid who wants to bully you but is a smart Intelligent mature kid and restrains himself But there is something about you that he doesn't like and they can probably tell you why you're bullied.

445
00:30:27,552 --> 00:30:31,630
Speaker 1: Ask them and I'll tell you this not from personal experience but from anecdotes and stories.

446
00:30:31,691 --> 00:30:35,338
Speaker 1: I've heard that that works and There are a lot of people out there who will.

447
00:30:35,378 --> 00:30:37,367
Speaker 1: if you ask they'll be honest and they won't like.

448
00:30:37,407 --> 00:30:41,568
Speaker 1: they won't try to hurt Your feelings but they'll tell you like man is because you smell like.

449
00:30:41,608 --> 00:30:43,803
Speaker 1: I'm sorry But you smell or some whatever it is.

450
00:30:44,044 --> 00:30:44,790
Speaker 0: We are those people.

451
00:30:45,551 --> 00:30:48,389
Speaker 0: yeah, if you want to know why you're bullied just ask us.

452
00:30:48,409 --> 00:30:54,389
Speaker 0: and Flaming geek if you start getting bullied it's because you lied about being from Japan.

453
00:30:54,409 --> 00:31:00,299
Speaker 1: though if you come clean, we can guarantee you some form of No, I really can't I don't know.

454
00:31:00,741 --> 00:31:02,850
Speaker 0: yeah, you won't end up like Star Wars game.

455
00:31:03,472 --> 00:31:07,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, Star Wars kid could make a lot of money or could have made a lot of money in my opinion.

456
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,298
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of you will slash there like what?

457
00:31:09,318 --> 00:31:11,570
Speaker 0: if he doesn't want to make money what he doesn't want to be famous?

458
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:12,734
Speaker 0: Well, he doesn't have to be.

459
00:31:12,794 --> 00:31:16,867
Speaker 1: but if your trouble in life is that you have to avoid fame and fortune.

460
00:31:16,887 --> 00:31:20,650
Speaker 0: Well Yeah, you're not getting my sympathy.

461
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:25,790
Speaker 0: Let me tell you that because it's not difficult to avoid fame and fortune and still maintain happiness.

462
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:27,758
Speaker 1: In fact, I would submit quite the opposite.

463
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:28,662
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

464
00:31:29,264 --> 00:31:30,750
Speaker 0: All right, we're done with Star Wars kid.

465
00:31:31,132 --> 00:31:33,165
Speaker 0: All right, let's get some video.

466
00:31:33,286 --> 00:31:33,769
Speaker 0: things of the day.

467
00:31:40,322 --> 00:31:42,389
Speaker 1: So anyway things of the day.

468
00:31:42,409 --> 00:31:44,456
Speaker 1: we talked about video games.

469
00:31:44,556 --> 00:31:45,579
Speaker 0: All the other stuff is over.

470
00:31:46,261 --> 00:31:47,786
Speaker 1: Yep, now my thing of the day.

471
00:31:47,806 --> 00:31:50,253
Speaker 1: the video I'm linking to is old.

472
00:31:50,614 --> 00:31:51,576
Speaker 1: it is fairly well known.

473
00:31:51,998 --> 00:31:52,740
Speaker 1: It is this guy.

474
00:31:53,181 --> 00:31:56,311
Speaker 1: He's a cop and he's in a classroom giving a demonstration.

475
00:31:56,351 --> 00:31:57,535
Speaker 0: Does he work for the DEA?

476
00:31:57,595 --> 00:32:04,728
Speaker 1: Yeah, he used to be a cop used to be a football player all sorts of things prison guard and He's doing a thing on gun safety and such.

477
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,700
Speaker 1: and he pulls out his Glock 40 and he's holding it.

478
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,106
Speaker 1: They're saying this is unloaded weapon.

479
00:32:09,126 --> 00:32:12,160
Speaker 1: It's a Glock 40 and he's talking it up all big and bad.

480
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,119
Speaker 0: I'm the only one professional enough to use this weapon.

481
00:32:14,341 --> 00:32:14,702
Speaker 1: This is the.

482
00:32:14,964 --> 00:32:29,538
Speaker 1: it's probably one of the most classic and ironic videos in the history of the Internet Because at the end of this long speech he basically says like Scott said I am probably I am the only person in this room Was professional enough to handle this gun and then he immediately immediately shoots himself in the fucking foot

483
00:32:29,879 --> 00:32:31,944
Speaker 0: not Pulls the trigger goes

484
00:32:32,105 --> 00:32:32,968
Speaker 1: BAM and he goes like

485
00:32:33,671 --> 00:32:36,160
Speaker 0: bullet comes out and goes into his foot.

486
00:32:36,763 --> 00:32:39,860
Speaker 1: It's it's freaking hilarious and he's trying to pretend he's not hurt.

487
00:32:40,141 --> 00:32:43,154
Speaker 1: But he's limping all around the room and like he doesn't know what to do it.

488
00:32:43,676 --> 00:32:44,379
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

489
00:32:45,243 --> 00:32:46,026
Speaker 0: So the news is.

490
00:32:46,267 --> 00:32:49,139
Speaker 1: the news is that this guy's back and I mean this happened quite some time ago.

491
00:32:49,962 --> 00:33:01,459
Speaker 1: the guy is back in the news because he is filing a lawsuit against the government for Basically allowing this video to be spread thus defaming his good character and limiting his career options.

492
00:33:02,942 --> 00:33:04,439
Speaker 0: Hello Star Wars kid.

493
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:12,015
Speaker 1: Yeah, so a guy shot himself in the foot and with a loaded gun that he said was unloaded in front of a bunch Of kids he could have easily shot one of the kids.

494
00:33:12,055 --> 00:33:14,040
Speaker 1: He's real lucky He didn't shoot one of the kids or something.

495
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:17,330
Speaker 0: he then he'd be in jail and being guarded by someone like himself.

496
00:33:17,731 --> 00:33:22,365
Speaker 1: and he's mad that because of this gross act of Negligence and incompetence.

497
00:33:22,827 --> 00:33:26,059
Speaker 1: He is now branded as a negligent and incompetent person.

498
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:27,281
Speaker 0: Gasp

499
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:49,417
Speaker 1: now, it's obvious to me that the lawyer he hired Knows that this is bullshit or is stupid and one of his friends because I read part of the actual legal filing and they introduced the guy as a Respected football player and then they list all of his credentials, you know work blah blah blah work blah blah.

500
00:33:49,457 --> 00:33:53,913
Speaker 1: commended blah blah blah but the primary one they listed that he was a respected football player.

501
00:33:53,933 --> 00:33:57,811
Speaker 0: a Judge doesn't care about your resume.

502
00:33:57,831 --> 00:33:59,620
Speaker 0: a good judge doesn't care about your resume.

503
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:05,004
Speaker 1: All I have to say is I am gonna follow this because if there's any way I can see a video of the trial I will get it.

504
00:34:05,266 --> 00:34:13,458
Speaker 1: or if I can find a transcript of what the judge says I will get it because when they show the video of him shooting himself in the foot in court I would bet money that the judge will laugh.

505
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,121
Speaker 1: That's the end.

506
00:34:15,141 --> 00:34:17,168
Speaker 0: Yeah, all are equal under the law.

507
00:34:17,268 --> 00:34:22,161
Speaker 0: be you president be you Bill Gates be you homeless bum be you President's.

508
00:34:22,201 --> 00:34:30,399
Speaker 1: not equal should be not while he's sitting because he the president can only be tried for high crimes and misdemeanors And he can only be tried by the house.

509
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,351
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's BS, but should be yeah.

510
00:34:33,793 --> 00:34:34,940
Speaker 0: Everyone should be equal under the law.

511
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:42,449
Speaker 0: Anyway, my thing today this got to the top of delicious popular today So I immediately tagged it with the flimflam tag.

512
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:45,800
Speaker 0: just a note to everyone out there if you ever see something on the internet.

513
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,784
Speaker 0: That's complete bullshit.

514
00:34:47,467 --> 00:34:50,480
Speaker 0: Put it on delicious with a tag of flimflam.

515
00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:53,770
Speaker 1: It's starting to spread some things we see that are flimflam.

516
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:55,516
Speaker 1: get tagged by it before we get to them.

517
00:34:55,777 --> 00:34:56,118
Speaker 0: Awesome.

518
00:34:56,379 --> 00:35:05,896
Speaker 0: So This video is on YouTube is supposedly a video of a guy with super acupuncture key powers.

519
00:35:06,358 --> 00:35:11,332
Speaker 1: now I'm we as we talked greatly earlier in this episode.

520
00:35:11,352 --> 00:35:16,271
Speaker 1: We are very skeptical of I don't know everything Basically, you're just reeks of bullshit.

521
00:35:16,432 --> 00:35:17,439
Speaker 0: This guy is just a crock.

522
00:35:18,061 --> 00:35:20,609
Speaker 0: The British guy who's there completely falls for it.

523
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:24,040
Speaker 0: the slightly skeptical camera girl also falls for it.

524
00:35:24,542 --> 00:35:28,680
Speaker 0: The guy claims that he has some sort of like electrical body power.

525
00:35:29,222 --> 00:35:29,382
Speaker 0: Like.

526
00:35:29,423 --> 00:35:32,132
Speaker 0: he zaps people and stuff now in the video.

527
00:35:32,152 --> 00:35:33,537
Speaker 0: You see people touch him and then go.

528
00:35:33,577 --> 00:35:42,600
Speaker 0: Ooh Yeah, well, there's that dim mock guy who Can make his students pretend that they like pass out when he just touches them.

529
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,102
Speaker 1: Yeah, yet.

530
00:35:43,122 --> 00:35:46,437
Speaker 1: He couldn't make the reporter pass out despite all of his efforts.

531
00:35:46,779 --> 00:35:53,560
Speaker 0: Yep so there's a huge psychology thing going on there and also there's a whole bunch of stage magic going on with his.

532
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:58,067
Speaker 0: You know probably got a battery in there somewhere Maybe like a little shocking finger.

533
00:35:58,127 --> 00:36:02,475
Speaker 1: the best is when he claims to set that piece of paper on fire with you know The cigarette that you can't really see.

534
00:36:02,515 --> 00:36:06,877
Speaker 0: so yeah He squishes a lump of paper to of newspaper together like real tightly.

535
00:36:07,078 --> 00:36:09,537
Speaker 0: obviously There's some sort of fire mechanism down there.

536
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:16,260
Speaker 0: Then he puts it to the side and kind of points his hands at it and then gets real close and it starts on fire.

537
00:36:16,922 --> 00:36:20,095
Speaker 1: All I gotta say is it doesn't bother me that this guy is some sort of charlatan.

538
00:36:20,135 --> 00:36:28,372
Speaker 1: because I see so many charlatans I just yeah, if you're gonna be a charlatan go nuts The fact that the reporters who are investigating him are such goddamn tools.

539
00:36:28,813 --> 00:36:33,447
Speaker 0: Yeah, not only that but how many people on Delicious and stuff believe this?

540
00:36:33,467 --> 00:36:36,520
Speaker 0: and that's why they linked to it and that's why it showed up on delicious popular.

541
00:36:36,884 --> 00:36:40,507
Speaker 0: Not everyone tagged it with flim-flam Very few people did in fact.

542
00:36:41,249 --> 00:36:44,199
Speaker 0: and on YouTube there tend to be three types of comments.

543
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:47,159
Speaker 0: one This the people saying it's real and those people no one likes.

544
00:36:47,802 --> 00:37:00,020
Speaker 0: To the people saying it's fake like us and those people that everyone likes except for the third type of person who Seems to be bothersome is that there's people who think that you should be fair and such and such and such.

545
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:00,482
Speaker 0: They're like.

546
00:37:00,502 --> 00:37:01,769
Speaker 0: this could be true.

547
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:02,754
Speaker 0: It might not be true.

548
00:37:02,794 --> 00:37:03,780
Speaker 0: We have to investigate.

549
00:37:06,522 --> 00:37:15,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's all well and good being fair and reasonable and open-minded But at the same time you don't want to take that so far you become stupid.

550
00:37:15,627 --> 00:37:20,705
Speaker 1: I mean the extraordinary claims require Extraordinary evidence.

551
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,872
Speaker 1: the key word there is extraordinary.

552
00:37:23,253 --> 00:37:28,172
Speaker 1: if I claim that I can burp No one is gonna not believe me.

553
00:37:28,534 --> 00:37:29,599
Speaker 0: You don't need any evidence.

554
00:37:31,443 --> 00:37:35,220
Speaker 0: And there you have sufficient evidence because it is not an extraordinary claim.

555
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,247
Speaker 0: It only requires normal evidence.

556
00:37:37,367 --> 00:37:44,096
Speaker 1: now if I claim that by burping I can create a sonic boom nobody should believe you.

557
00:37:44,117 --> 00:37:57,226
Speaker 0: and if someone was going to believe you we would have to have a whole lot of demonstrations to prove that your burps are actually causing sonic booms and such and such and such and such and such and scientific studies and God.

558
00:37:58,089 --> 00:38:05,333
Speaker 0: and without that we all can only assume that Your burps cannot cause sonic booms because that is common-sense.

559
00:38:05,373 --> 00:38:08,059
Speaker 1: boom sonic boom sonic boom Yes.

560
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:19,087
Speaker 0: So the next time someone comes in your house and says your toaster can do perform in a musical If you want to be open-minded, you know, you can say it might be true The toaster might be able to get up and sing and dance

561
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:21,155
Speaker 1: the flaming geek might be in Japan

562
00:38:21,395 --> 00:38:27,880
Speaker 0: and this acupuncture guy The acupuncture guy might really be able to zap you with electricity.

563
00:38:28,284 --> 00:38:49,164
Speaker 1: I just like to say right now that During the episode because we took a short break between the first half and the second half - I went to got a drink of water and Scott was picking at his face, but We got a message from our friend Katsu in the forums who was basically telling us that yeah I've pretty much determined that this guy isn't in Japan and we've already Talked about it.

564
00:38:49,445 --> 00:38:50,709
Speaker 1: So Katsu.

565
00:38:51,251 --> 00:38:53,338
Speaker 1: Yeah, we beat you to it, but props.

566
00:38:53,759 --> 00:38:58,540
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean apparently when he was posting like oh my god, it's X o'clock in Japan.

567
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:03,611
Speaker 0: You know the forum sees what time you post things in Eastern Time.

568
00:39:03,691 --> 00:39:07,020
Speaker 0: So if you compare the times they're they're wrong.

569
00:39:08,301 --> 00:39:11,753
Speaker 0: So then he said, oh my god, my watch battery is dead.

570
00:39:11,773 --> 00:39:14,427
Speaker 0: Yeah, you have a computer in front of you You're not.

571
00:39:14,448 --> 00:39:15,119
Speaker 0: you're done.

572
00:39:15,783 --> 00:39:16,325
Speaker 0: Give it up.

573
00:39:16,767 --> 00:39:17,250
Speaker 1: It's over.

574
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:17,973
Speaker 0: It's over.

575
00:39:18,114 --> 00:39:19,239
Speaker 1: wonder what it'll do when he hears this.

576
00:39:20,001 --> 00:39:23,230
Speaker 1: You know what flaming geek if you give us some audio feedback, that'd be awesome.

577
00:39:23,551 --> 00:39:31,734
Speaker 0: Yeah, flaming geek record an mp3 of Yourself saying something or perhaps, you know the sounds of the street in Japan where they're.

578
00:39:31,855 --> 00:39:34,890
Speaker 1: I guarantee if you send us something We'll probably play it.

579
00:39:35,394 --> 00:39:37,249
Speaker 0: It'll be hilarious Okay.

580
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,059
Speaker 0: Oh And one last way, you know, the acupuncture guy is fake.

581
00:39:42,782 --> 00:39:45,854
Speaker 0: If this is real he supposedly says that anyone can do this.

582
00:39:46,416 --> 00:39:49,949
Speaker 0: if anyone could do it How come more people aren't doing it?

583
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,739
Speaker 1: How come the military isn't all over this?

584
00:39:53,420 --> 00:40:00,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, if this is real wouldn't the US military be training every single soldier to have electrical set things on fire powers?

585
00:40:00,624 --> 00:40:10,891
Speaker 1: I mean a lot of people point to the fact that during the Cold War the US and the Russian governments both research psychic powers as a means of espionage or combat or whatever.

586
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:11,795
Speaker 1: and it's true.

587
00:40:11,856 --> 00:40:14,727
Speaker 1: they both did and They didn't find anything.

588
00:40:14,767 --> 00:40:16,919
Speaker 1: and that's why there are no psychic military units.

589
00:40:17,881 --> 00:40:23,280
Speaker 1: They investigated it because they figured hey it won't cost that much and we might as well see well anything that gives us an edge.

590
00:40:23,822 --> 00:40:25,129
Speaker 1: And they discovered that no it doesn't.

591
00:40:25,169 --> 00:40:25,993
Speaker 1: it doesn't do anything.

592
00:40:26,053 --> 00:40:27,480
Speaker 1: It's stupid and they quit.

593
00:40:28,344 --> 00:40:30,796
Speaker 1: Just because someone studied something does not mean it's valid.

594
00:40:31,379 --> 00:40:39,370
Speaker 0: now It means it's valid when someone studies something and then continues to study it and finds uses for it And then it becomes an ology that's not made up.

595
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:48,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's very unlikely that something as Amazing as the claims many of these people make would not be widespread in use by someone.

596
00:40:49,461 --> 00:41:01,919
Speaker 1: Even if there was some massive conspiracy by like the pharmaceuticals to keep the magic onion that cures cancer away from the world Some doctors somewhere would say hey this onion cures cancer and then you can't hide stuff like that.

597
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:06,239
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh my god, and the fat I mean Yeah.

598
00:41:06,602 --> 00:41:13,618
Speaker 0: But it comes down to is if there really was an onion that cured cancer More people than just a bunch of hippies and health food stores would be saying it.

599
00:41:14,201 --> 00:41:21,742
Speaker 0: Everyone would be like holy crap and to be on the news and it'd be like pharmaceutical companies exposed hiding the magic onion Wouldn't?

600
00:41:21,762 --> 00:41:21,923
Speaker 0: just?

601
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:23,387
Speaker 1: my hippies we're done we've.

602
00:41:23,929 --> 00:41:24,691
Speaker 1: we barely talked about.

603
00:41:24,711 --> 00:41:27,540
Speaker 1: you know, we're talking about video games starting now video game time.

604
00:41:27,601 --> 00:41:34,659
Speaker 1: We're gonna talk about Tetris DS Which in my opinion is probably the current crowning achievement of Tetris.

605
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:41,804
Speaker 0: Tetris DS is the greatest incarnation of the game of Tetris Currently conceived by man.

606
00:41:42,045 --> 00:41:48,480
Speaker 1: It is perhaps Tetris perfection to be rivaled only by future greater releases of the same game.

607
00:41:49,564 --> 00:41:59,680
Speaker 0: If you want to know a lot about Tetris It's actually this really really good article interview with one of the Tetris dudes on planet GameCube Which usually doesn't have the greatest article.

608
00:41:59,861 --> 00:42:07,500
Speaker 0: So go read that and you'll learn a lot of shit about how they decide Who can make a Tetris game and what they can put in it and all kinds of stuff?

609
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,940
Speaker 1: It's actually really interesting really interesting.

610
00:42:10,321 --> 00:42:24,271
Speaker 1: but before we talk about Tetris in detail the one thing I want to say the glow at the most glowing recommendation I can make About it and the greatest evidence I have for its awesomeness is the fact that I am perfectly willing and in fact happy to spend $35 to buy Tetris in the year 2006.

611
00:42:24,271 --> 00:42:31,875
Speaker 0: again I paid $50 for Tetris for the NES in like 1980 whatnot?

612
00:42:32,336 --> 00:42:35,891
Speaker 0: and other people paid like 30 bucks for it on the Gameboy.

613
00:42:35,911 --> 00:42:41,416
Speaker 1: Yep, and a little note I think Tetris is still the number one selling Gameboy original game ever.

614
00:42:41,657 --> 00:42:42,160
Speaker 0: I think it is.

615
00:42:43,025 --> 00:42:43,165
Speaker 0: It's.

616
00:42:43,266 --> 00:42:45,540
Speaker 0: even without Tetris the original Gameboy would have hit the pooper.

617
00:42:46,082 --> 00:42:48,993
Speaker 1: Yeah, because the Gamegear was well exactly like the PSP.

618
00:42:49,194 --> 00:42:50,740
Speaker 0: if the Gamegear had Tetris they would have scored.

619
00:42:50,841 --> 00:42:51,565
Speaker 0: That's what it was all about.

620
00:42:51,585 --> 00:42:52,995
Speaker 1: It had a bunch of cool puzzle games.

621
00:42:53,075 --> 00:42:53,780
Speaker 0: Not Tetris.

622
00:42:54,021 --> 00:42:54,684
Speaker 0: It had lousy.

623
00:42:55,086 --> 00:42:55,468
Speaker 0: what was it?

624
00:42:55,528 --> 00:42:56,433
Speaker 0: crystals or columns?

625
00:42:56,453 --> 00:42:58,763
Speaker 1: Well that and the Gameboy lasted You know forever.

626
00:42:58,823 --> 00:43:01,533
Speaker 1: on those double-a batteries the Gamegear lasted about six minutes.

627
00:43:01,794 --> 00:43:01,994
Speaker 1: Yeah.

628
00:43:02,536 --> 00:43:02,717
Speaker 1: All right.

629
00:43:02,797 --> 00:43:08,186
Speaker 1: I owned a Gamegear So I I'm not I'm ragging on something I love Tetris.

630
00:43:08,668 --> 00:43:11,359
Speaker 0: oh my god, so Tetris DS first off.

631
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,332
Speaker 0: Everything in Tetris DS has an old-school retro Nintendo theme.

632
00:43:16,352 --> 00:43:22,029
Speaker 0: You've got Mario's you've got Zelda's you've got metroids You've got balloon fighters a doctor from gyro my.

633
00:43:22,049 --> 00:43:23,293
Speaker 0: you got gyro mites.

634
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,540
Speaker 0: You got all the cool retro stuff.

635
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:30,315
Speaker 0: So if you're a Nintendo fan a Donkey Kong's Donkey Kong is actually the best one in this game.

636
00:43:30,636 --> 00:43:32,783
Speaker 1: The music is Fantastic.

637
00:43:33,003 --> 00:43:40,140
Speaker 0: like they take the old-school beats and they spruce them up a little bit and consider that the sound chips.

638
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:44,940
Speaker 1: The way sound is done in the DS is actually very very advanced and good.

639
00:43:45,643 --> 00:43:48,860
Speaker 1: This music in this game is the kind of music I wouldn't mind listening to on an iPod.

640
00:43:49,645 --> 00:43:56,200
Speaker 0: The best part is as you find songs in the game It unlocks them in a little like sound mode so you can go listen to the songs whenever you want.

641
00:43:56,581 --> 00:43:59,614
Speaker 1: Yeah, someone is probably going to rip them all to some sort of torrent collection.

642
00:43:59,694 --> 00:44:02,762
Speaker 1: I will then download and listen to Awesome.

643
00:44:02,783 --> 00:44:03,625
Speaker 0: Okay.

644
00:44:03,665 --> 00:44:06,492
Speaker 0: So the single player of this has like six modes.

645
00:44:06,532 --> 00:44:12,467
Speaker 0: I think the modes are normal Tetris Push mode, which is awesome.

646
00:44:12,667 --> 00:44:15,677
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll get to that touch mode, which is alright.

647
00:44:15,758 --> 00:44:16,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll mode.

648
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,169
Speaker 0: I forget the other modes because I don't really.

649
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:22,198
Speaker 0: Oh mission mode, which is link.

650
00:44:23,584 --> 00:44:30,734
Speaker 1: yeah, mission mode is cool because basically they give you a mission like get two lines at the same time with a line between them.

651
00:44:30,754 --> 00:44:31,517
Speaker 1: that isn't gotten.

652
00:44:31,538 --> 00:44:39,140
Speaker 0: or Make a Tetris or get three Tetris in a row make a line using the yellow piece.

653
00:44:39,882 --> 00:44:40,705
Speaker 1: Yeah stuff like that.

654
00:44:40,825 --> 00:44:48,651
Speaker 1: And while that may sound dumb when you play it one, it's really fun - it really Teaches you how to be good at Tetris really quickly.

655
00:44:48,671 --> 00:44:50,277
Speaker 0: I think that was what the guy said.

656
00:44:50,357 --> 00:44:57,886
Speaker 0: is that Mission mode is there to teach you techniques of Tetris that you may not have known Or that you may not realize.

657
00:44:57,906 --> 00:45:11,740
Speaker 0: in playing the normal game where you're just trying to make Tetris's, you know Sometimes you're playing Tetris and you get caught in a difficult situation and you don't know what to do And you can't really figure out a way to out a way to save yourself and you die.

658
00:45:12,095 --> 00:45:16,571
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean I play my Personal Tetris style is that I drop pieces as fast as I can.

659
00:45:16,953 --> 00:45:25,664
Speaker 1: as soon as I see a place where a piece could go Where it will not directly harm me or make an open hole somewhere that I can't fill I immediately drop it Which is very effective.

660
00:45:26,045 --> 00:45:28,753
Speaker 1: until I get a piece that doesn't fit my little scheme then I'm fucked.

661
00:45:29,094 --> 00:45:36,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, so mission mode Because it forces you to do things besides just get as many lines as quickly as possible.

662
00:45:37,241 --> 00:45:44,060
Speaker 0: Often what will happen is you'll learn to do things in a non-obvious way.

663
00:45:44,703 --> 00:45:53,080
Speaker 0: That will create better Tetris situations for you And I can attest to the fact that my Tetris skills have improved greatly due to playing mission mode.

664
00:45:53,261 --> 00:46:06,724
Speaker 1: I will attest to this as well because playing against Scott and Tetris while I do not get completely and totally owned by him at all Fronts he fairly thoroughly schooled me for a while until I finally started catching up a little Two days ago.

665
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:08,592
Speaker 0: I schooled this guy, but last night.

666
00:46:08,693 --> 00:46:10,460
Speaker 0: I was just getting hosed by these guys.

667
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,042
Speaker 0: I was playing.

668
00:46:11,082 --> 00:46:13,391
Speaker 0: damn they get the shit out of me all right.

669
00:46:13,672 --> 00:46:15,700
Speaker 1: now the main thing about Tetris is all right.

670
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,320
Speaker 1: I'm good at Tetris whatever I can play Tetris on my cell phone.

671
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:19,203
Speaker 1: Why is this a big deal?

672
00:46:19,223 --> 00:46:21,330
Speaker 1: the answer to that is multiplayer.

673
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:23,397
Speaker 0: the multiplayer is insane.

674
00:46:23,437 --> 00:46:23,939
Speaker 0: if you play?

675
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:34,437
Speaker 0: With people in the same within 30 feet of you you know a bunch of DS's and a bunch of friends You can play what 10 player Tetris yep, and we did this at uber con with a bunch of people and it's crazy.

676
00:46:36,041 --> 00:46:40,435
Speaker 1: I mean yelling and screaming and Tetris is flying everywhere people throwing items at each other.

677
00:46:40,455 --> 00:46:43,315
Speaker 0: the best is you can make teams Which could be even more fun?

678
00:46:43,336 --> 00:46:43,538
Speaker 0: Yeah?

679
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,883
Speaker 1: We didn't even try that.

680
00:46:45,124 --> 00:46:46,709
Speaker 0: yeah and everyone to choose teams.

681
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:52,254
Speaker 0: you like you have team link and team Mario and team balloon fighter and Team ice climber, and oh it's good.

682
00:46:52,274 --> 00:46:56,810
Speaker 0: It's good stuff All right, so the the Wi-Fi.

683
00:46:57,211 --> 00:46:57,813
Speaker 0: you can only.

684
00:46:58,115 --> 00:46:58,757
Speaker 0: oh, that's the other thing.

685
00:46:58,777 --> 00:47:02,332
Speaker 0: in wireless mode I think you can play all the a lot of different modes.

686
00:47:02,493 --> 00:47:04,963
Speaker 1: Yeah, we've only really really play Touch.

687
00:47:05,044 --> 00:47:12,920
Speaker 0: more push mode yeah, but online on Wi-Fi You can play a lot fewer modes than you can with normal wireless.

688
00:47:14,043 --> 00:47:22,798
Speaker 0: You can only play two-player Tetris with no items four-player Tetris with items and push which is a two-player game no matter what.

689
00:47:23,139 --> 00:47:26,748
Speaker 1: now Push push is a is a revolution in gaming.

690
00:47:26,788 --> 00:47:33,223
Speaker 0: as far as I'm concerned push is perhaps the greatest two-player Tetris Game ever created.

691
00:47:33,924 --> 00:47:40,237
Speaker 0: the way this works is you have one column one full column and one player.

692
00:47:41,321 --> 00:47:47,800
Speaker 0: Both players look to themselves like they're on top of the column, but really one guy sees it flipped vertically.

693
00:47:48,343 --> 00:47:51,800
Speaker 0: So your top is your bottom is the other guy's top.

694
00:47:52,623 --> 00:48:01,456
Speaker 0: So it looks to you like they're pieces that are out of your control coming from below Cramming into the bottom of your Tetris j-game going on

695
00:48:01,757 --> 00:48:08,710
Speaker 1: and there are two Tiny one by one blocks at the bottom of each of about the bottom middle area of the screen and that's

696
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:09,234
Speaker 0: at the start.

697
00:48:09,476 --> 00:48:18,568
Speaker 0: yeah, and basically what happens is You drop pieces and if your piece lands on another piece Then it stops and you start to make Tetris's.

698
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:22,158
Speaker 1: if you don't land a piece on something it flies off into the ether and you Get a new piece.

699
00:48:22,264 --> 00:48:27,260
Speaker 0: Yeah If you you can drop pieces right through the board out the other side and nothing happens and you get a new piece.

700
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:32,419
Speaker 0: So if there's a big hole in the board and you get pieces you don't like you can just throw them down the hole Until you get something you want.

701
00:48:32,661 --> 00:48:33,243
Speaker 0: Here's the catch.

702
00:48:33,825 --> 00:48:37,660
Speaker 0: if you make more than one line at a time you get a double the triple the Tetris.

703
00:48:38,483 --> 00:48:43,320
Speaker 0: It moves the whole board every single Tetris piece down.

704
00:48:44,123 --> 00:48:50,324
Speaker 0: so if you get a Tetris it moves every single piece on the board down four spaces in The background.

705
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:51,411
Speaker 0: it's all Donkey Kong.

706
00:48:51,472 --> 00:48:52,760
Speaker 0: So there's a little level markers.

707
00:48:53,081 --> 00:48:58,380
Speaker 0: It's like zero one two, and then you know minus one minus two, then there's a danger zone.

708
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:18,219
Speaker 0: so you're making a board of Tetris and you're putting pieces on top and the other guy is putting pieces on the bottom and You move the whole board down which gives you a bigger amount of room to work with to make Tetris's and it shrinks the other guys room to work with to make Tetris's and That that gets really cool because that's how you kill him.

709
00:49:18,461 --> 00:49:23,099
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically when you push the other guy into his top completely you're done you went you in it's over.

710
00:49:23,601 --> 00:49:26,592
Speaker 0: However, there's a certain amount of strategy and push.

711
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,580
Speaker 0: you see it is still one board.

712
00:49:28,962 --> 00:49:31,419
Speaker 0: The other guy can use your pieces against you.

713
00:49:31,941 --> 00:49:39,420
Speaker 0: Let's say I stack up and I'm ready for a Tetris and I got to put the long piece on the side and I get A Tetris and I've also done the same thing.

714
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:44,820
Speaker 1: So we basically got a whole solid board with one row completely empty all the way through on the far left side.

715
00:49:45,181 --> 00:49:50,780
Speaker 0: Well, if anyone drops a long piece down this hole it's gonna fly right out the other side and no Tetris's are gonna happen.

716
00:49:51,483 --> 00:49:52,427
Speaker 0: So, what do you do?

717
00:49:52,669 --> 00:49:54,638
Speaker 0: Well, you're gonna have to block it up.

718
00:49:55,986 --> 00:49:56,640
Speaker 0: Now here's the thing.

719
00:49:56,701 --> 00:49:58,720
Speaker 0: Let's say I just put a piece on top of that hole.

720
00:49:59,101 --> 00:50:09,059
Speaker 0: The other guy drops two long pieces down to it and I built up that big block to make Tetris's and he got the Tetris Using those pieces I set up and it moves the whole board up and I'm in trouble.

721
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:19,246
Speaker 0: You have to use the L pieces to make triple lines while also making the L piece completely disappear and Thus leaving the hole.

722
00:50:19,386 --> 00:50:23,100
Speaker 0: so the other guy can't get a Tetris, but you get a triple and you move the board down.

723
00:50:23,401 --> 00:50:36,060
Speaker 0: That's pretty much the only strategy I found for beating the situation in which there is a vertical column that is empty but there's more strategy to it than that and Push is a really exciting game of two-player Tetris.

724
00:50:36,622 --> 00:50:44,080
Speaker 1: Now there are a few little kinks to this Tetris game that I don't think any of them detract from the game at all But they're definitely there and they make Tetris a little bit different.

725
00:50:44,423 --> 00:50:46,439
Speaker 1: The one thing people have been calling it infinite spin.

726
00:50:46,941 --> 00:50:53,875
Speaker 1: Basically, you are almost entirely free to keep moving a piece around once it hits the bottom in any configuration you want before it sets Mm-hmm.

727
00:50:54,461 --> 00:51:04,390
Speaker 1: Now that might sound stupid until you realize that in classic Tetris the game starts out really really ass-slow like It did it and it slowly speeds up.

728
00:51:05,092 --> 00:51:07,540
Speaker 1: this game starts right away going pretty fast.

729
00:51:08,362 --> 00:51:15,690
Speaker 1: So that way and some Nintendo people even said this this way you can jump right into the action and the games quick immediately But you're not completely hosed.

730
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:20,368
Speaker 1: if you just happen to put a piece in the wrong spot Mm-hmm, and two you have a sideboard.

731
00:51:20,749 --> 00:51:27,735
Speaker 1: you can hit R to pop a piece into it and then any time you hit R again it'll pop that piece out and pop whatever piece you had out into it.

732
00:51:28,539 --> 00:51:30,427
Speaker 1: and There are many possibilities for this.

733
00:51:30,527 --> 00:51:34,758
Speaker 0: Yeah, so basically if you get a long piece, but it's not ready for Tetris time Yeah, you can hold on to it.

734
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:37,280
Speaker 0: And then when it's time for Tetris you pull that out and way.

735
00:51:37,601 --> 00:51:43,107
Speaker 1: Or you get a green piece and it doesn't fit anywhere and you don't want to put it down pop it in and then drop It out later when you made a hole for it.

736
00:51:43,388 --> 00:51:43,569
Speaker 0: Yep.

737
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:48,986
Speaker 0: So usually what happens is I'll get a piece I don't want I'll put it in I'll get another piece I'll put that on the board.

738
00:51:49,228 --> 00:51:51,279
Speaker 0: then all of a sudden the other piece fits I take it out.

739
00:51:51,742 --> 00:51:54,419
Speaker 1: It adds a little dimension to the game that I really enjoy.

740
00:51:55,183 --> 00:51:59,560
Speaker 0: The final thing about this Tetris is that you can see six pieces into the future unless there's a boo.

741
00:51:59,761 --> 00:52:00,667
Speaker 0: But don't worry about boo.

742
00:52:00,788 --> 00:52:02,540
Speaker 0: Yep, boo boo sauce.

743
00:52:02,641 --> 00:52:04,109
Speaker 1: I don't take too much advantage of that.

744
00:52:04,169 --> 00:52:09,999
Speaker 1: yet in that usually all I do is I Out of the corner my eye keep an eye on it and I see when a long piece is coming up.

745
00:52:10,241 --> 00:52:11,165
Speaker 0: That's what's the.

746
00:52:11,185 --> 00:52:14,480
Speaker 0: it's the beginning strategy of see of the six piece future.

747
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:18,659
Speaker 0: But the real strategy to use is you look at those six pieces that are coming up.

748
00:52:19,741 --> 00:52:21,065
Speaker 0: You want to set up the board.

749
00:52:21,126 --> 00:52:24,617
Speaker 0: if you see a piece that's over there that will basically ruin you.

750
00:52:24,697 --> 00:52:34,160
Speaker 0: if it gets onto the Board use the pieces before it because you know what they're gonna be To create a situation to where every piece is always a good piece and no piece will ever fuck you.

751
00:52:34,261 --> 00:52:36,057
Speaker 1: Like let's say you've got a rampart.

752
00:52:36,077 --> 00:52:36,922
Speaker 1: basically You've gotten.

753
00:52:37,083 --> 00:52:43,820
Speaker 1: you've got no like a whole bunch of little jaggies and no like flat area of land at the top And you see the square coming now.

754
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,834
Speaker 1: There's nowhere to put that square on your current board.

755
00:52:45,855 --> 00:52:46,479
Speaker 1: that won't fuck you.

756
00:52:47,062 --> 00:52:49,736
Speaker 1: So use all the other pieces to make some flat land for it.

757
00:52:49,756 --> 00:52:54,393
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Now if you don't see a square coming, you know, I mean if there's a square.

758
00:52:54,413 --> 00:52:58,638
Speaker 0: if there's no square in the next area You know that it's more than six pieces away.

759
00:52:59,541 --> 00:53:02,820
Speaker 0: Feel free to not make any area for a square to go.

760
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:08,036
Speaker 0: You can you know make a not as good Tetris and you'll be just fine because it's no squares coming.

761
00:53:08,377 --> 00:53:08,859
Speaker 0: Don't worry about it.

762
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:12,713
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can read more in that article that I talked about which will link to.

763
00:53:13,134 --> 00:53:13,696
Speaker 0: you can read out.

764
00:53:13,737 --> 00:53:15,202
Speaker 0: the guy talks all about This stuff.

765
00:53:15,503 --> 00:53:16,306
Speaker 0: Yep, and why?

766
00:53:16,346 --> 00:53:18,213
Speaker 0: they decided that it's not actually Nintendo.

767
00:53:18,253 --> 00:53:19,578
Speaker 0: It's a feature of all Tetris's.

768
00:53:20,901 --> 00:53:25,460
Speaker 1: It's kind of like a standards committee or consortium only it's for a game instead of something real.

769
00:53:26,062 --> 00:53:26,964
Speaker 0: It is something real.

770
00:53:27,486 --> 00:53:28,208
Speaker 0: at least it should be.

771
00:53:28,548 --> 00:53:31,960
Speaker 1: yeah, I Don't really know what else we can say about Tetris.

772
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:34,066
Speaker 1: It's a very simple game that for some reason.

773
00:53:34,247 --> 00:53:38,059
Speaker 1: Well, I can think of a lot of reasons is just immensely awesome.

774
00:53:40,084 --> 00:53:45,097
Speaker 1: I mean, there are a million similar type games, but Tetris really is one of the best.

775
00:53:45,779 --> 00:53:56,200
Speaker 0: the best You know, it pretty much comes down to this if you have a Nintendo DS and you don't have Tetris You should go get Tetris even at $35 and you should probably get it for 30 somewhere.

776
00:53:57,041 --> 00:53:57,824
Speaker 0: It's totally worth it.

777
00:53:58,426 --> 00:54:05,721
Speaker 0: If you don't have a Nintendo DS, you should buy a Nintendo DS and then buy Tetris or else You're dumb.

778
00:54:05,741 --> 00:54:15,818
