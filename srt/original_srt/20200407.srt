00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,541
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday April 7th 2020.

00:00:15,229 --> 00:00:18,723
Speaker 1: tonight We are talking about Animal Crossing New Horizons.

4
00:00:19,145 --> 00:00:26,570
Speaker 1: Let's do this So it's finally warm enough to get outside and that is really helping my sanity during the whole quarantine.

5
00:00:27,673 --> 00:00:29,947
Speaker 0: Yeah, this problem is is even though I can go outside.

6
00:00:29,968 --> 00:00:33,941
Speaker 0: I work I have to stay inside until 5 still.

7
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:41,899
Speaker 0: so what I'm doing the whole thing is I wanted to work from home So that I could just do whatever the hell I wanted to The monkey spa.

8
00:00:41,919 --> 00:00:43,104
Speaker 1: monkey spa just curled.

9
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:44,269
Speaker 1: now you get to work from home.

10
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,349
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I can't do whatever I want while I'm working from home.

11
00:00:48,491 --> 00:00:53,145
Speaker 0: I wanted to like, you know, wake up and bike until like, you know noon.

12
00:00:53,206 --> 00:00:55,694
Speaker 0: come home do a little work Maybe see.

13
00:00:55,715 --> 00:00:57,422
Speaker 1: the problem is you didn't want to work from home.

14
00:00:57,723 --> 00:00:59,410
Speaker 1: You just wanted to not work.

15
00:01:00,153 --> 00:01:11,510
Speaker 0: Yeah But I could still do the amount of work that I do if I go to the office Eight hours, I wanted to do the same total hours of actual work and of all the other times spent doing something else.

16
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:20,810
Speaker 0: Like for example, if I was legit working from home, right the good the way I wanted I could go out to lunch at us at a restaurant with service.

17
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:26,993
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course, I can't just go to the baroness and get a burger if I want but you can't sit there and eat it During lunch.

18
00:01:27,094 --> 00:01:27,315
Speaker 0: Nope.

19
00:01:27,396 --> 00:01:28,422
Speaker 1: I gotta go back to my home.

20
00:01:28,443 --> 00:01:32,676
Speaker 1: Yeah But what I'm doing now is everyone.

21
00:01:32,696 --> 00:01:41,576
Speaker 0: I wanted to bring up a laptop to the park or the beach and be like Well, I'm doing I'm available to work But nope can't do that.

22
00:01:41,817 --> 00:01:45,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I'm gonna start sitting with my laptop on the balcony doing work at least occasionally.

23
00:01:46,213 --> 00:01:49,669
Speaker 0: Yes, I can do that as long as the Sun is in the right position to not burn me.

24
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:56,530
Speaker 1: Nah, but my plan now is every day if I'm during lunch I'm actually gonna go outside and go for a run or a bike first and then eat lunch.

25
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:08,398
Speaker 0: Mmm, so say like for example today the meeting I had a meeting at 10 and a meeting at 1 So I had not enough time really To get my shit together between them.

26
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:11,410
Speaker 1: Don't you doctor, you know, my job is mostly meetings.

27
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:17,310
Speaker 1: Half of my job is literally just talking to people repeatedly and then having meetings with like my five meetings all day.

28
00:02:18,251 --> 00:02:28,327
Speaker 1: Mmm, luckily all the nerds I can just use instant messaging or you'd like to do the meetings and not actually have to talk out Because a lot of my good engineers they would much rather just instant message me.

29
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:37,747
Speaker 1: then Actually, like get into a video call and talk for a half-hour But all the business side things it's got to be like video chat face-to-face ten people in the room.

30
00:02:37,788 --> 00:02:38,129
Speaker 1: Let's go.

31
00:02:40,683 --> 00:02:53,620
Speaker 1: So there is a bunch of news, but since there's no Sports happening right now Like normally this time of year is when we're starting to talk about NHL playoffs and like the Rangers Like are they gonna make the wild card, but we got nothing.

32
00:02:54,103 --> 00:02:56,539
Speaker 1: So I'm actually watching a lot more eSports instead.

33
00:02:57,681 --> 00:03:00,631
Speaker 1: Okay, cuz overwatch league is still going still trucking on.

34
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:03,340
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, the only sport that's not canceled the eSports.

35
00:03:03,923 --> 00:03:05,973
Speaker 1: So the thing about overwatch league is the.

36
00:03:06,073 --> 00:03:12,699
Speaker 1: I like watching eSports tournaments But I very rarely watch them live because I don't care that much who wins.

37
00:03:13,362 --> 00:03:17,520
Speaker 0: So usually I'll either watch highlight reels or like you want New York to end as a New York.

38
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,600
Speaker 1: I mean, I do want New York to win and Excelsior always they're still like very good in the league.

39
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:25,574
Speaker 1: Excelsior is a solid team to be a fan of but most of the other games.

40
00:03:25,615 --> 00:03:28,800
Speaker 1: I don't care that much or The game might not be exciting.

41
00:03:29,221 --> 00:03:30,385
Speaker 1: Sometimes they are sometimes they aren't.

42
00:03:30,425 --> 00:03:38,300
Speaker 1: so I tend to just wait for the VODs and I'll either watch highlight reels or I'll watch Like the game everyone was talking about from the previous day on YouTube.

43
00:03:38,883 --> 00:03:41,999
Speaker 0: That is a problem and I think a lot of eSports is that there is.

44
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:47,988
Speaker 0: you know professional sporting leagues tend to have Often more parody.

45
00:03:48,008 --> 00:03:48,812
Speaker 0: Yeah.

46
00:03:48,912 --> 00:03:58,891
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know even in NHL It's like well teams that are clearly better than the other team will only beat the crappy team not a hundred percent of the time But maybe like 70% of the time, right?

47
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:07,006
Speaker 0: Except the red wings right now Right, but in a lot of eSports, you know You watch say like a fighting game tournament.

48
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:10,360
Speaker 0: towards the end of the tournament you get parody you get excitement, right?

49
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,504
Speaker 0: Those early rounds.

50
00:04:11,524 --> 00:04:11,865
Speaker 0: Oof.

51
00:04:12,046 --> 00:04:20,055
Speaker 0: It's just like yeah, like watch the York play say Boston in overwatch Watch like Sonic Fox play against whoever it gets paired up with in round one.

52
00:04:20,076 --> 00:04:20,517
Speaker 0: Yeah, like boom

53
00:04:22,924 --> 00:04:36,660
Speaker 1: I'm thinking if you remember one must fall 2097 when you get the news commentator talking about the fight you just had and if you utterly Fucking crushed your opponent the commentator was like if you wanted to see a fair test of skill tonight was not your night.

54
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:42,620
Speaker 1: However, if you were looking for a masochistic pounding have we got highlights for you, right?

55
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,295
Speaker 0: You know usually other pro sports that have like opens like say US Open of golf.

56
00:04:47,315 --> 00:04:54,000
Speaker 1: You don't really see the Yeah, cameras not a direct in the last person, right?

57
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,376
Speaker 0: You never see the guy who hits it into the trees 20 times up captain Joe plus 20, right?

58
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:03,280
Speaker 1: They're following like Tiger Woods plus one or minus two or wherever they are something.

59
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,716
Speaker 0: Well US Open is pretty hard even for the best people.

60
00:05:05,797 --> 00:05:09,299
Speaker 0: Yeah, but But like even in f1 there was a super aguri.

61
00:05:10,201 --> 00:05:12,491
Speaker 0: That's right, you know, but you but you don't see.

62
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:14,520
Speaker 0: they don't keep the camera on the super aguri.

63
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:15,469
Speaker 0: You can just watch.

64
00:05:15,651 --> 00:05:16,540
Speaker 1: you check in with them.

65
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,716
Speaker 0: You know Mercedes is in the Ferraris and whoever's up front you can just keep your eyes on them.

66
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,613
Speaker 0: the Red Bulls Whoever is now this year is the good car.

67
00:05:23,794 --> 00:05:26,588
Speaker 1: I don't need to watch Uprising lose but I get.

68
00:05:26,668 --> 00:05:29,661
Speaker 1: I like someone to check in and tell me that they lost Right.

69
00:05:30,082 --> 00:05:33,411
Speaker 0: So it's like when you're watching even NFL football was a less parody.

70
00:05:33,912 --> 00:05:34,153
Speaker 0: right.

71
00:05:34,393 --> 00:05:41,514
Speaker 0: when there's a game that's like Cleveland Browns Versus so-and-so you just don't watch that game because there's so many simultaneous games.

72
00:05:41,815 --> 00:05:43,340
Speaker 0: They got the red zone, right?

73
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,840
Speaker 1: So you're always watching something, you know good Yep, so I think this when the other problem is Overwatch League is global.

74
00:05:50,001 --> 00:06:03,887
Speaker 1: so like the games are on weekends like Saturday and Sunday mostly but Some of the matches I want to watch or at like 4 a.m And the matches I don't give a shit about are like 6 when I would normally watch like I don't want to watch Houston and Like I just don't care.

75
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,698
Speaker 1: so I'm gonna.

76
00:06:05,718 --> 00:06:13,720
Speaker 1: I'm gonna Try to watch some more live games But probably not this weekend because there's no live games during my time zone that I care that much about.

77
00:06:14,362 --> 00:06:18,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, most of what we've been watching eSports wise is linked to the past randomizer.

78
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:21,239
Speaker 0: There was a tournament and we watched the tournament, which is great.

79
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:29,600
Speaker 0: But now there's a league that's going on and the league has a lot Let like I just said less parody than the late rounds of the tournament which are super legit.

80
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:34,498
Speaker 0: The league has a lot of you know, some teams are just better than others, right?

81
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:39,317
Speaker 0: Yeah It's just like complete blowouts and it's not exciting close races.

82
00:06:39,438 --> 00:06:41,996
Speaker 0: Like the Tournament was towards the end there.

83
00:06:43,062 --> 00:06:49,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean with these niche sports like when you get to randomizers that is already a subculture of a subculture of a subculture.

84
00:06:49,723 --> 00:06:54,906
Speaker 0: Yet the number of people watching those things is shocking Like it's really a link to the past.

85
00:06:54,946 --> 00:06:57,575
Speaker 0: randomizer community is shockingly large.

86
00:06:57,635 --> 00:07:12,284
Speaker 0: like they put together this league I think the teams are three or four people I don't know three or four people each and there's a ton of teams and Every even minor races have like hundreds or perhaps even like a thousand viewers Right.

87
00:07:12,305 --> 00:07:14,240
Speaker 0: It's way more popular than bringing geek nights.

88
00:07:15,108 --> 00:07:18,192
Speaker 1: Yeah Girl, we serve a very specific audience.

89
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:20,340
Speaker 1: The listener appreciates us Sure.

90
00:07:21,123 --> 00:07:31,219
Speaker 1: So in some other news one a lot of you like I didn't even notice this News about cooking mama at first because the few tweets I knew it but the few tweets I saw about it.

91
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:39,040
Speaker 1: We're so obviously not true that I ignored it as like a ridiculous conspiracy bullshit thing, but it hit getting talked about.

92
00:07:39,622 --> 00:07:43,500
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, so I saw this news in the beginning because it was in the Nintendo switch community.

93
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,523
Speaker 0: Yeah, I shouldn't sorry.

94
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:53,040
Speaker 0: and then basically people were saying hey this cooking mama came came out and that's a semi popular Second tier maybe third tier franchise.

95
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,003
Speaker 0: that was really one of those like.

96
00:07:54,024 --> 00:08:04,833
Speaker 0: there's a lot of these game franchises that were big on the DS or Nintendo mobile platforms We're that we're sort of like big in the small pond, right?

97
00:08:04,913 --> 00:08:06,599
Speaker 1: Yeah, like brain age was that?

98
00:08:07,302 --> 00:08:09,550
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, that's a Nintendo first party title.

99
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,360
Speaker 0: I'm talking about like your golden sons, right?

100
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,936
Speaker 1: Oh, I forgot about golden son the nine door nine, whatever nine something's.

101
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:22,040
Speaker 0: there's like Actually a whole bunch of third-party games, you know Phoenix, right?

102
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,052
Speaker 0: I guess falls in that category to write these things that were really popular on Mobile Nintendo platforms.

103
00:08:28,093 --> 00:08:30,204
Speaker 0: they weren't on Consoles are right.

104
00:08:30,284 --> 00:08:31,227
Speaker 0: It was just in there.

105
00:08:31,267 --> 00:08:35,580
Speaker 0: But now that switches everything all those games are mixed up in the switch.

106
00:08:35,821 --> 00:08:36,402
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

107
00:08:36,422 --> 00:08:36,964
Speaker 0: So the new.

108
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:45,988
Speaker 0: then if there are new games in those franchises suddenly they have the visibility Outside the the mobile realm.

109
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:57,270
Speaker 0: and for anyone who hasn't like the Nintendo portable Gameboy You know D at GBA DS, right 3ds That is like this great.

110
00:08:57,812 --> 00:09:02,860
Speaker 0: I think still underrated underappreciated treasure trove of amazing games.

111
00:09:03,642 --> 00:09:22,473
Speaker 0: It's like this enormous library a lot of shovelware, but also a lot of amazing games that I think is really Underappreciated not talked about not cared about But anyway, so cooking mama was a pretty big game on the DS and a pretty nothing game to anyone Who wasn't paying attention to DS?

112
00:09:22,493 --> 00:09:26,828
Speaker 1: Yep And it's not having a game but it's like.

113
00:09:26,848 --> 00:09:29,658
Speaker 1: I know style like I see the appeal of this kind of game.

114
00:09:29,698 --> 00:09:31,280
Speaker 1: It was popular right.

115
00:09:32,681 --> 00:09:37,916
Speaker 0: so it was a new one that came out on the switch and It was even in stores.

116
00:09:38,016 --> 00:09:39,701
Speaker 0: cartridges in stores, right.

117
00:09:39,962 --> 00:09:42,229
Speaker 0: and then suddenly it was removed from the e-shop.

118
00:09:42,369 --> 00:09:48,056
Speaker 1: now We do not mysteriously as a dateline know Actually why it was removed.

119
00:09:48,538 --> 00:09:51,770
Speaker 1: like we do not know that there have been some compete conflicting.

120
00:09:52,211 --> 00:10:00,497
Speaker 1: It sounds like it's a dispute between the developers and the publisher and or Nintendo like we don't know Mm-hmm.

121
00:10:01,164 --> 00:10:01,609
Speaker 0: But anyway.

122
00:10:02,513 --> 00:10:08,478
Speaker 0: So imagine it instantly disappeared from the e-shop Right shortly after release.

123
00:10:08,558 --> 00:10:14,210
Speaker 0: people still have cartridges and they can play it but now people like whoa Hold on to that cartridge because it might be valuable.

124
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,875
Speaker 0: It's gonna be some rare game right.

125
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:27,254
Speaker 1: but then some some people started just tweeting this ridiculous rumor that it was removed because it was mining bitcoins on your switch and then Switch.

126
00:10:27,516 --> 00:10:30,370
Speaker 1: and I saw the baby and the baby looked at me, right?

127
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:34,070
Speaker 0: So there are two reasons that I immediately knew that that was bullshit, right?

128
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:40,850
Speaker 0: number one Obviously if you had a game that was mining bitcoins or cryptocurrency on a switch that it would get pulled from the store.

129
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:52,070
Speaker 1: However, number one Nintendo switches are weak sauce CPU wise Yeah, the days he could mine a Bitcoin on a CPU as opposed to a dedicated nightmare machine.

130
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:57,810
Speaker 0: Oh, it has a GPU but technically and I guess you have it if you can infect enough of them.

131
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,761
Speaker 0: But how many people are buying cooking mama, even if that's true, right?

132
00:11:01,842 --> 00:11:04,610
Speaker 0: It's like and then it's end of the battery would just die.

133
00:11:05,191 --> 00:11:06,813
Speaker 0: It's like it's a weak sauce thing.

134
00:11:06,853 --> 00:11:08,395
Speaker 0: That's not a good idea.

135
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:20,190
Speaker 0: and to every game that comes out on Nintendo switch is Thoroughly thoroughly thoroughly reviewed by Nintendo like if you got some malware onto the switch.

136
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:28,887
Speaker 0: Officially like my head is off to you Nintendo doesn't fuck around Yeah, so it's like you think it's hard to get your app into like the Apple App Store.

137
00:11:28,927 --> 00:11:30,733
Speaker 0: It's like no no no no Right.

138
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:35,813
Speaker 0: Nintendo is like it's completely examining every inch of your source Software.

139
00:11:35,853 --> 00:11:40,390
Speaker 1: the vector is in is implausible, but the the result is also implausible.

140
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,520
Speaker 1: But it would be impossible to mine bitcoins on a Nintendo switch.

141
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:54,407
Speaker 0: You could do a very small amount of mining Yeah, and if you got enough switches together Maybe you could mine a coin and so anyway, but the point is that was a bullshit story.

142
00:11:54,447 --> 00:12:02,570
Speaker 1: I could tell from the start Yep, and then all these reports like the so-called reports of like switches being bricked by the game literally all came from like one tweet.

143
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:08,056
Speaker 0: Well, it does seem to be true At least more likely to be true.

144
00:12:08,076 --> 00:12:14,437
Speaker 0: I don't know this confirmed that the game is just poorly coded in unity in general Right.

145
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:25,472
Speaker 0: Yeah Like that it was put together by like some you know first-time Dev team that didn't have mad skills and so the game is poorly coded and Inefficient.

146
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:30,670
Speaker 0: so your switch will heat up and it'll use a lot of CPU and drop frames, and you know it's not well done.

147
00:12:30,931 --> 00:12:36,214
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there are a lot of games that have similar problems like that is not really evident of anything obviously.

148
00:12:36,536 --> 00:12:53,180
Speaker 0: so it somebody's claiming to be a Anonymous developer on the game or working at the developer Or perhaps a reporter possibly making up a source possibly having a real source Yeah, has told the story.

149
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,290
Speaker 0: that is much more plausible, right?

150
00:12:55,470 --> 00:13:27,876
Speaker 0: So we'll take it as truth for the time being that there was a battle between the publisher and developer Right in the in the legal realm right and that is why the game has been pulled and there's some Shenanigans going on business wise which is totally what you would expect From that sort of thing yeah, and that's why this game has disappeared from the e-shop But it remains true that as it was a game and a somewhat significant known franchise that was in the e-shop and pulled and their cartridges out there and Hard to get.

151
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:35,663
Speaker 0: so I would recommend Getting a cartridge wouldn't be If you got one hold on is probably not awful.

152
00:13:35,743 --> 00:13:37,270
Speaker 0: cookie mom is like I fun.

153
00:13:37,431 --> 00:13:40,748
Speaker 0: I can't imagine how bad a new cookie mama game could be if you play it.

154
00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:44,008
Speaker 0: If you don't play it and put it in the closet, you know.

155
00:13:44,732 --> 00:14:01,460
Speaker 1: So another another component of where this rumor seems to have come from is This talk about a company that was involved in the creation of the game Saying like that company was also involved not in cryptocurrency, but in blockchain Which is a generic ledger technology.

156
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,730
Speaker 1: Bitcoin just happens to use a blockchain.

157
00:14:03,871 --> 00:14:06,079
Speaker 1: There are other ways to use blockchain now.

158
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:06,460
Speaker 0: Also.

159
00:14:06,501 --> 00:14:07,986
Speaker 0: It seems that that is just messed up.

160
00:14:08,207 --> 00:14:11,215
Speaker 0: I mean like They were just made up.

161
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:14,850
Speaker 0: yeah, but full disclosure they're not actually doing any blockchain anything.

162
00:14:15,131 --> 00:14:19,750
Speaker 1: Well, there were a bunch of companies trying to get investors.

163
00:14:19,851 --> 00:14:27,610
Speaker 1: I'm not saying this happened here But I've been privy to a lot of VC pitches and I saw a lot of this in other games in the industry.

164
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:45,910
Speaker 1: People would basically to try to get idiots who want to invest in Bitcoin to invest in like a game studio or a publisher would Try to incorporate blockchain technology in some reasonably plausible feasible way Just so they can say that it is pushing the frontier of blockchain.

165
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:50,730
Speaker 0: I think it's more like and there are there are people are investing in buzzwords.

166
00:14:50,851 --> 00:14:54,909
Speaker 0: Let's just attach the buzzword to our thing without actually doing whatever the buzzword is.

167
00:14:55,150 --> 00:15:06,967
Speaker 1: The most common thing to do if you did anything was just to use something like blockchain to record Transactions that multiple players have on their own systems without having to necessarily trust those systems.

168
00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:13,990
Speaker 1: for like trading like trading goods Like using it as the back end for item trading in games online like that's it.

169
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:19,167
Speaker 0: It still seems like not the oh, no, it's blockchain is never the right database for anything.

170
00:15:19,187 --> 00:15:20,090
Speaker 0: the World of Warcraft way.

171
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:20,762
Speaker 0: I have a database.

172
00:15:20,823 --> 00:15:33,489
Speaker 1: Yep like I'm not saying that is a reasonable technology to use for these purposes, but it's Plausible enough for to make a case more and more every day.

173
00:15:34,695 --> 00:15:42,741
Speaker 0: I'm starting to believe that pretty much almost all Business, you know, sir software problems.

174
00:15:42,882 --> 00:15:45,270
Speaker 1: Oh you're thinking about that because of a specific threat in our forum.

175
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:49,910
Speaker 0: No, I'm just saying almost all business software problems in the world.

176
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:59,530
Speaker 0: Whatever your business is right, whatever your problem is if it's an information Problem right that a computer can solve yeah Postgres probably solves it.

177
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:02,323
Speaker 0: You probably don't need to do anything else.

178
00:16:02,383 --> 00:16:03,910
Speaker 0: You don't need any weird anything else.

179
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:04,333
Speaker 0: You know what?

180
00:16:04,374 --> 00:16:06,269
Speaker 0: just well just start with Postgres.

181
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:14,010
Speaker 0: yeah, do as much as you can with Postgres QL and towards solving your problem and Add a programming language on top of it.

182
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:19,390
Speaker 0: You know to get an application running on a server Python or even see it doesn't for anything that can connect to Postgres.

183
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:21,759
Speaker 0: Right and get those two pieces.

184
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:28,848
Speaker 0: and if you can't solve your problem with those two pieces After putting a lot of effort in then you're allowed to add more pieces.

185
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:32,881
Speaker 1: Yep It's like if you don't know why you need them, you don't need them.

186
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:43,229
Speaker 0: if you don't know there's almost no information Problem that cannot be solved with a combination of Postgres and any modern programming language running on a server.

187
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,523
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, you don't need anything else.

188
00:16:45,744 --> 00:16:46,630
Speaker 1: Well, you need a message bus.

189
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:46,991
Speaker 1: I don't know.

190
00:16:47,011 --> 00:16:48,317
Speaker 1: throw like Kafka on top of it.

191
00:16:48,377 --> 00:16:51,670
Speaker 0: done might need that maybe maybe but you could also.

192
00:16:52,292 --> 00:16:56,148
Speaker 0: But you should implement your message bus as just like a fucking Q and JMS.

193
00:16:56,188 --> 00:16:58,017
Speaker 0: you first Right there.

194
00:16:58,037 --> 00:17:00,450
Speaker 0: must you know that Postgres probably has some queuing feature.

195
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:04,904
Speaker 1: I you know built in something postgres a long way since the last time I mess right directly.

196
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:09,488
Speaker 0: don't go using a Kafka until you Figured out that you can't do it directly in Postgres itself.

197
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:17,329
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, I guess we actually we actually have a Kafka at work doing some stuff In terms of enterprise service bus like one of those like big iron like buses.

198
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:20,049
Speaker 0: I'm not saying that other pieces are never to be used.

199
00:17:20,431 --> 00:17:23,361
Speaker 0: Okay, I'm saying that you know, they definitely have.

200
00:17:23,922 --> 00:17:26,109
Speaker 0: there are problems that do need more stuff.

201
00:17:26,411 --> 00:17:39,399
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I have seen that majority not solar Systems like Solr solar to handle amounts of data that could trivially be handled by Literally any other solution right?

202
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:42,610
Speaker 0: For example, you postgres full-text search is pretty damn good.

203
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,392
Speaker 0: Oh, right.

204
00:17:43,653 --> 00:17:46,381
Speaker 1: It's also go adding or performance and you might expect.

205
00:17:46,882 --> 00:17:48,968
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, so don't go adding some kind of.

206
00:17:49,249 --> 00:17:56,430
Speaker 0: you know Lucene's solar elastic search whatever until you've proven that the full-text search in Postgres isn't good.

207
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:56,691
Speaker 0: Yeah,

208
00:17:56,711 --> 00:18:11,706
Speaker 1: you know when I went in an old company when I brought some architecture that I owned from just a database to a Lucene Index that was when we got to the point of trade teeth keeping track of 50 million daily Transactions that were moderately large and wanting to keep six months of them.

209
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:13,653
Speaker 0: Yep Ridiculous shit.

210
00:18:14,255 --> 00:18:14,777
Speaker 0: Not one day.

211
00:18:15,098 --> 00:18:15,279
Speaker 0: Yep.

212
00:18:15,339 --> 00:18:15,801
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday.

213
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:18,650
Speaker 1: Yep, but cooking mama is not mining bitcoins.

214
00:18:18,871 --> 00:18:21,117
Speaker 0: Good God, like no, it's definitely not.

215
00:18:21,358 --> 00:18:24,828
Speaker 1: I get more than one source before you spread this crap like.

216
00:18:24,868 --> 00:18:27,270
Speaker 1: seriously I got a brief geek bite.

217
00:18:27,631 --> 00:18:29,698
Speaker 1: If you haven't dusted off slay the spire in a while.

218
00:18:29,758 --> 00:18:34,575
Speaker 1: single-player game available on Steam on switch like pretty much everywhere Except iOS.

219
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:39,390
Speaker 1: I'm still waiting for it is great on the switch because the user interface is so good.

220
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,576
Speaker 1: It is such a good.

221
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:48,027
Speaker 1: lay in bed and play this game until you fall asleep Like the UX is just perfect or how you manipulate these cards.

222
00:18:48,068 --> 00:18:56,796
Speaker 1: This game is great but What I want a geek bite is that the switch has the new character that was added and all the balance changes that were added The watcher the new character.

223
00:18:56,816 --> 00:19:06,030
Speaker 1: if you even if you think you played slay the spire out I would definitely recommend picking it back up and going through the ascensions with the new character.

224
00:19:06,331 --> 00:19:11,933
Speaker 1: The new character is radically different from the other characters in a really fun ways Mm-hmm.

225
00:19:12,114 --> 00:19:15,966
Speaker 1: The main thing is the character has stances and cards will cards and potions.

226
00:19:16,006 --> 00:19:17,270
Speaker 1: things can put you into stances.

227
00:19:17,691 --> 00:19:19,135
Speaker 1: So you might get into aggressive stance.

228
00:19:19,435 --> 00:19:21,440
Speaker 1: That means you do double damage.

229
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:22,162
Speaker 1: Just full stop.

230
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,127
Speaker 1: You also take double damage.

231
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,430
Speaker 1: Oh You can go to a column stance.

232
00:19:27,952 --> 00:19:32,970
Speaker 1: All that does is whenever you exit the column stance you get two more energy right then and there.

233
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:35,950
Speaker 1: So you can like make clever combos.

234
00:19:36,111 --> 00:19:39,710
Speaker 1: It's really like a long play like you'll play this like you'll be fighting a boss.

235
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:48,290
Speaker 1: You do no damage to this boss for like ten rounds setting up your ridiculous combo And then you play one turn that one shots the boss.

236
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:48,571
Speaker 1: Like.

237
00:19:48,591 --> 00:19:51,581
Speaker 1: that's the kind of way that's the kind of style you play with this character.

238
00:19:52,042 --> 00:19:53,186
Speaker 1: It is crazy fun.

239
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,530
Speaker 0: Oh So that actually reminds me just very quickly.

240
00:19:56,991 --> 00:20:03,390
Speaker 0: There was a early access game that I played called on steam called curse of the dead gods.

241
00:20:03,691 --> 00:20:07,988
Speaker 0: It is still that I still believe it is early access.

242
00:20:08,008 --> 00:20:11,169
Speaker 0: Let me just verify Yeah, it's early access game.

243
00:20:11,703 --> 00:20:20,810
Speaker 0: And yeah basically What this game is is it's a slay the spire kind of roguelike right where you have the mat the branching map and you choose Where you're going next and each different thing.

244
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:24,690
Speaker 0: You could go to a gold room or an item room or a stats room to choose what kind of right?

245
00:20:25,171 --> 00:20:28,401
Speaker 0: But instead of playing a card game at each spot.

246
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:34,209
Speaker 0: you play basically sort of a real-time Diablo esque action RPG.

247
00:20:35,613 --> 00:20:36,559
Speaker 0: So it's like you go.

248
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:37,867
Speaker 0: I'll go to the gold room.

249
00:20:38,008 --> 00:20:38,290
Speaker 0: all right.

250
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:46,170
Speaker 0: Here's a tiny two Diablo rooms And there's a lot of gold in them and also bad guys and it's a little bit more action real time than Diablo.

251
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,814
Speaker 0: But it's still isometric view.

252
00:20:48,476 --> 00:20:52,506
Speaker 0: right you know use your spells and abilities and attacks and whatever.

253
00:20:52,546 --> 00:20:54,130
Speaker 0: you know parrying stuff like that.

254
00:20:55,731 --> 00:20:56,896
Speaker 0: It's very early access.

255
00:20:56,957 --> 00:20:59,990
Speaker 0: the amount of content is you know sparse?

256
00:21:01,392 --> 00:21:03,329
Speaker 0: But it still was pretty fun.

257
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:07,870
Speaker 0: I played it for about an hour, and I'm probably gonna play it again once it gets more content.

258
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:12,590
Speaker 0: It seems there was a major update today at 11 a.m.. Room variations see they're adding.

259
00:21:13,391 --> 00:21:17,306
Speaker 1: One of the reasons why I tend to avoid early access for games that I know I'm gonna like.

260
00:21:17,326 --> 00:21:18,993
Speaker 0: yeah, no no I just wanted to.

261
00:21:19,013 --> 00:21:20,120
Speaker 0: I just you know I like.

262
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:25,085
Speaker 0: I said I put it in I checked it out And I probably won't go back to it until it's done.

263
00:21:25,245 --> 00:21:29,144
Speaker 0: ish right Because I sort of played out the amount of content.

264
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:29,968
Speaker 0: They had very quickly.

265
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:45,704
Speaker 1: So speaking of you know where this is like a prime season to dust off a steam library To play video games that you didn't have time to play like ah we're playing a lot of video games But the industry that is in deep shit right now is the board game industry.

266
00:21:45,965 --> 00:21:51,657
Speaker 1: things are not going well And some of the reasons you can anticipate But some of them you probably can't.

267
00:21:52,019 --> 00:22:05,850
Speaker 1: there were other problems that had happened in this industry like late last year that already put it in a precarious situation, so We're looking at maybe a lot of publishers like slowing down laying people off the project.

268
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:10,048
Speaker 0: I just wonder what it means indirectly for the table because I don't care of.

269
00:22:10,088 --> 00:22:18,103
Speaker 0: if you know I already felt like one of the major problems of the board gaming industry which probably contributed to this was Making way too many games.

270
00:22:18,183 --> 00:22:28,889
Speaker 1: hundred percent I think a lot of which are a lot of the studios that are getting like gonna go down to be perfectly blunt Didn't really have a viable path to success anyway, and we're riding a bubble at best, right?

271
00:22:30,675 --> 00:22:46,970
Speaker 0: So The thing is that I don't care if all those games that weren't any good anyway stop gliding up the market with shovelware inventory Right, but what I do care is oh well if there's not as many game publishers Are there gonna be less gaming cons?

272
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:52,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, or less gaming stores because the gaming stores are also not doing well.

273
00:22:52,511 --> 00:22:54,036
Speaker 1: But now they can't even.

274
00:22:54,076 --> 00:22:57,446
Speaker 1: they can't make money from selling because online that's there's not.

275
00:22:57,467 --> 00:22:58,470
Speaker 1: you can't make enough money with that.

276
00:22:58,891 --> 00:23:03,030
Speaker 1: And they can't make money with the impulse buys because people are playing games in their shops.

277
00:23:04,854 --> 00:23:10,117
Speaker 1: Yep, and you think oh everyone stuck at home everyone stuck at home isolated So very hard to get a board game going.

278
00:23:10,137 --> 00:23:13,730
Speaker 1: people who would normally buy and play a board game are going to tabletop simulator.

279
00:23:14,071 --> 00:23:16,258
Speaker 1: They're going to online implementations of these games.

280
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,465
Speaker 1: They're going to the game like slay the spire.

281
00:23:18,485 --> 00:23:19,769
Speaker 1: They're just playing video games instead.

282
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,275
Speaker 1: Yep, two-player games.

283
00:23:22,656 --> 00:23:28,149
Speaker 1: I think are having a minor Renaissance, but there aren't that many two-player games.

284
00:23:29,671 --> 00:23:32,468
Speaker 1: they're sold out everywhere the good two-player games I know of.

285
00:23:32,488 --> 00:23:38,450
Speaker 1: and You're not gonna be able to build and develop a new two-player game because you can't manufacture things in China.

286
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:45,530
Speaker 1: Not just because of the virus and all that situation Not just because of all the supply chain distribution problems coming all the way up to the u.s.

287
00:23:45,811 --> 00:23:50,466
Speaker 1: And everywhere in the world but because of all the tariffs and all the other shit that was going down last year.

288
00:23:50,486 --> 00:23:51,850
Speaker 1: That's still happening.

289
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:55,359
Speaker 0: Yep, there's also a lot of shenanigans going on.

290
00:23:55,479 --> 00:24:02,984
Speaker 0: with regards to you know, as mode a you know A lot of the though the return policy problems the right.

291
00:24:03,004 --> 00:24:03,386
Speaker 0: this did.

292
00:24:03,406 --> 00:24:05,835
Speaker 0: there have been distributor Situations.

293
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:12,268
Speaker 0: they changed their distributors around FMG had huge cutbacks right on all their products that weren't selling.

294
00:24:12,308 --> 00:24:16,544
Speaker 1: basically The industry was entering a contraction and there was a lot of trouble going down.

295
00:24:16,945 --> 00:24:18,150
Speaker 1: and then this happened.

296
00:24:18,612 --> 00:24:22,329
Speaker 0: So basically what you're gonna see at minimum I think is the board game.

297
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:36,010
Speaker 0: Hobby industry right is gonna retract back to only the successful things Right and you're gonna see a lot less of those like board game shelf with a million games including like obscure ones.

298
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,737
Speaker 0: It's gonna be like no there's your Warhammer.

299
00:24:38,757 --> 00:24:39,940
Speaker 0: There's your magic.

300
00:24:40,381 --> 00:24:41,605
Speaker 0: There's your pandemic.

301
00:24:41,645 --> 00:24:42,507
Speaker 0: There's a Dominion.

302
00:24:42,527 --> 00:24:45,232
Speaker 0: is your Right?

303
00:24:45,432 --> 00:24:52,329
Speaker 1: the big boys cuz you might think even if I let's say like the crisis boils down a little bit and all the like.

304
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:56,350
Speaker 1: Fall conventions happen like PAX West and packs unplugged for example.

305
00:24:56,893 --> 00:25:04,244
Speaker 1: The problem is right around now is when Expo space and publisher deals and all the things for those conventions would.

306
00:25:04,264 --> 00:25:06,190
Speaker 0: well, it's like you think Gen Con is gonna happen.

307
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,074
Speaker 0: That's a lot earlier.

308
00:25:07,094 --> 00:25:09,041
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think Gen Con is gonna happen.

309
00:25:09,543 --> 00:25:10,045
Speaker 0: origins.

310
00:25:10,065 --> 00:25:10,628
Speaker 0: I don't know when.

311
00:25:10,668 --> 00:25:14,745
Speaker 1: that yeah but even the planning for those events is just in October.

312
00:25:14,826 --> 00:25:22,210
Speaker 1: is that gonna happen and Companies that are already in a retraction are not as able to dump their advertising budget on things?

313
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:28,270
Speaker 1: They're probably gonna cannibalize that advertising budget to focus on core properties and monetization and just staying alive.

314
00:25:28,691 --> 00:25:34,290
Speaker 1: So it's gonna be a real rough time for the game like the board game industry as a whole.

315
00:25:35,175 --> 00:25:37,109
Speaker 0: I think it's actually though a good time.

316
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:39,336
Speaker 0: well It's a bad time for a game publisher for

317
00:25:39,797 --> 00:25:40,078
Speaker 1: sure

318
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:47,769
Speaker 0: who is trying to like gather up board games and sorry It's a good time if you're a board game author

319
00:25:48,351 --> 00:25:56,110
Speaker 1: Yep, if you're a core designer like if you're just doing a design if you're doing like that early research You're just you're building something, but you don't have to ship it right away.

320
00:25:56,291 --> 00:26:13,170
Speaker 0: There will be less shovelware clogging up the market Right, and so if you come up with like an actual legit hit big-time game Right, you can go the Kickstarter normal route, you know You're gonna have to get your game printed somewhere that can still print it at a probably a higher price.

321
00:26:13,311 --> 00:26:15,850
Speaker 0: Oh, you're still gonna be able to ship it somehow.

322
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:23,370
Speaker 1: Right, I think you're also gonna see a pivot to companies that are good at taking an existing tabletop game and making an online implementation.

323
00:26:24,032 --> 00:26:25,215
Speaker 1: Your day has come.

324
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:27,021
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah now is the time.

325
00:26:27,061 --> 00:26:32,812
Speaker 1: like the fact that the root video game is not out yet because they weren't in that much of a rush is Terrible.

326
00:26:32,872 --> 00:26:41,809
Speaker 1: because if if root were online now even just with the original game like the original factions I think it would like be near the top of the steam charts.

327
00:26:42,911 --> 00:26:44,094
Speaker 0: Maybe like that's.

328
00:26:44,475 --> 00:26:47,723
Speaker 0: the people doing that are the same people who did the Y&Y.

329
00:26:47,743 --> 00:26:49,728
Speaker 0: Yeah digital edition, which is good.

330
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:52,417
Speaker 0: It is Yeah, it's I'm looking it up right now.

331
00:26:52,437 --> 00:26:54,042
Speaker 1: I earned something.

332
00:26:54,122 --> 00:26:55,145
Speaker 1: I always lose track of them.

333
00:26:55,627 --> 00:26:56,510
Speaker 0: dire wolf dire wolf.

334
00:26:57,538 --> 00:27:00,863
Speaker 0: Yeah Dire wolf digital right there.

335
00:27:00,923 --> 00:27:09,797
Speaker 0: They did a Sagrada They did eternal echoes of eternity Raiders of the North Sea yellow and yanxi and they're doing the digital root edition And they did a great job.

336
00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:14,373
Speaker 0: if anyone's got yellow and yanxi on steam Let's play.

337
00:27:14,393 --> 00:27:15,378
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's get a game going.

338
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:17,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would love to play that together.

339
00:27:18,591 --> 00:27:19,053
Speaker 0: Let's do it.

340
00:27:19,454 --> 00:27:24,729
Speaker 1: All right, and last we'll go brief on this because I want to get talking about Animal Crossing But this is an Animal Crossing news.

341
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:27,577
Speaker 1: We all know that nobody like zipper.

342
00:27:28,219 --> 00:27:31,830
Speaker 0: zipper the bunny because I only saw him on the first day and then he disappeared.

343
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,677
Speaker 1: Yep, he came back because I'm a little.

344
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:37,170
Speaker 1: Emily joined my island and then he came back so she could talk to her to him.

345
00:27:37,432 --> 00:27:38,646
Speaker 0: oh, I see I see.

346
00:27:38,707 --> 00:27:44,710
Speaker 1: but When I saw zipper, I kind of started because everyone kept saying oh, there's this bunny and I hate it.

347
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,841
Speaker 1: But then I saw the bunny that is some five nights at Freddy's.

348
00:27:47,881 --> 00:27:53,076
Speaker 1: shit is clearly in a costume is clearly not a bunny And he's looking at me.

349
00:27:53,116 --> 00:27:53,498
Speaker 0: I think that's.

350
00:27:53,619 --> 00:28:05,644
Speaker 1: I think it's supposed to be that, you know, it's well It's supposed to be like a working person Like it's just a job like this person is wearing this costume and trying their hardest But it's either Tom Nook or someone Tom Nook hired.

351
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:09,689
Speaker 1: Yeah, but in reality It just feels like it's five nights at Freddy's and this thing's gonna murder me.

352
00:28:10,153 --> 00:28:12,230
Speaker 0: He's trying to attract people to the island with his holiday.

353
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:19,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the news is that Animal Crossing has the Easter event called Bunny Day in the u.s.

354
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,402
Speaker 1: you know all the events that they do.

355
00:28:20,422 --> 00:28:24,280
Speaker 1: and Nobody liked the egg hunts either.

356
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:32,817
Speaker 1: and people were so mad about it that Nintendo They actually dialed back the egg dropper rates because no one wants to get more eggs They want to find actual fish.

357
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,578
Speaker 0: Well, they mostly dialed it back on The sky eggs because they were just too many.

358
00:28:38,598 --> 00:28:39,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

359
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,107
Speaker 0: They were constant like balloons are coming.

360
00:28:41,187 --> 00:28:42,934
Speaker 1: I stopped shooting them down I didn't care anymore.

361
00:28:43,416 --> 00:28:46,330
Speaker 0: Well, I look at the balloon to see if it's a bunny one or a regular one.

362
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,628
Speaker 0: Yeah, if it's a bunny one I ignore it, right?

363
00:28:49,613 --> 00:28:51,110
Speaker 0: But I don't think they dialed them back at the other day.

364
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:56,917
Speaker 0: I think what it is is that the rate that they had makes sense From the standpoint of.

365
00:28:56,937 --> 00:29:03,946
Speaker 0: I've been playing this game for a while and I have all the stuff and I'm sure Need something like oh, I'm gonna craft all the Bunny Day stuff Let's go.

366
00:29:04,552 --> 00:29:05,033
Speaker 0: But it doesn't.

367
00:29:05,053 --> 00:29:07,862
Speaker 0: it doesn't make sense for a game that just came out.

368
00:29:07,922 --> 00:29:10,370
Speaker 0: people are still trying to like build up from nothing.

369
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:13,806
Speaker 1: I'm still trying to get a second room like new players are buying this game by the day, right?

370
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,951
Speaker 0: It's like you're trying to get your you know beginning of game stuff Like.

371
00:29:18,011 --> 00:29:27,530
Speaker 0: I need you know to get all I need to get all the basic common fish and it's like well half the fish you Pull are just water eggs, right and that gets in the way I'm like, what if I started the game today?

372
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:30,081
Speaker 1: Like how am I even gonna like do anything right.

373
00:29:30,403 --> 00:29:32,110
Speaker 0: the other thing it'll be over in five days.

374
00:29:32,752 --> 00:29:42,059
Speaker 0: the thing that really I think for me made the vent less fun is That none of the Bunny Day goods ugly.

375
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:45,067
Speaker 0: It's so ugly and bleh.

376
00:29:45,087 --> 00:29:45,589
Speaker 0: I don't want.

377
00:29:45,609 --> 00:29:49,769
Speaker 1: I was like Cool, and it's just like this bulb is monstrosity.

378
00:29:50,472 --> 00:29:57,514
Speaker 0: Yeah, if any of them were ones I wanted or right then it would be like, oh I need eggs to make the cool Bunny-day, whatever.

379
00:29:57,554 --> 00:30:00,223
Speaker 1: I want the cherry blossom stuff instead, right?

380
00:30:00,243 --> 00:30:02,130
Speaker 0: There actually isn't that much cherry blossom stuff.

381
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:02,873
Speaker 0: It's very few.

382
00:30:02,933 --> 00:30:04,299
Speaker 1: I know but that's the only things I want.

383
00:30:05,062 --> 00:30:06,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, and cherry blossoms go away in three days.

384
00:30:07,595 --> 00:30:08,583
Speaker 1: Oh, I better deal with that.

385
00:30:12,995 --> 00:30:21,900
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day.

386
00:30:22,361 --> 00:30:31,516
Speaker 1: So, uh, if you watch the wonderful sport of ice hockey one thing and you're not like in ice hockey culture One thing that always stands out to people is oh shit.

387
00:30:31,556 --> 00:30:32,260
Speaker 1: Are they just fighting?

388
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,743
Speaker 1: why isn't anyone stopping them?

389
00:30:33,783 --> 00:30:45,656
Speaker 1: cuz like if someone tries to have a fistfight in like a basketball game a football match Malice at the palace like the police get involved like that is a problem like that does not.

390
00:30:45,796 --> 00:30:53,900
Speaker 0: I'm still of the opinion that if There is a like, you know a fight in ice hockey game You should be as you know, you show the press charges against the other.

391
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,478
Speaker 1: But ice hockey's weird in that there are.

392
00:30:56,538 --> 00:30:59,108
Speaker 1: no they're the only written rules about fighting.

393
00:30:59,248 --> 00:31:02,078
Speaker 1: are that if you fight you and the person you fought with get five minutes?

394
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,939
Speaker 1: and Then there's other penalties like if you instigated the fight.

395
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:11,560
Speaker 0: Versus if you had that fight on the street, you'd at least have like a night in jail or a summons or something.

396
00:31:11,721 --> 00:31:13,628
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, but I'd like that.

397
00:31:13,969 --> 00:31:14,370
Speaker 1: but there's.

398
00:31:14,411 --> 00:31:18,779
Speaker 1: basically there's the written rules of fighting in hockey Which are very straightforward and very simple.

399
00:31:19,401 --> 00:31:28,969
Speaker 1: And then there's the actual rules because like all hockey fans who watch hockey know that the rule is if two people are fighting and They're fine They followed the rules to start the fight.

400
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:32,805
Speaker 1: the refs really can't stop them unless Someone wins the fight hour.

401
00:31:32,845 --> 00:31:38,220
Speaker 1: It comes to the ground like and they follow these rules, but they're not written down anywhere.

402
00:31:38,802 --> 00:31:42,055
Speaker 1: So what this video is is a humorous 10-minute long video.

403
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,300
Speaker 1: I think it's a Bruins fan.

404
00:31:43,641 --> 00:31:47,277
Speaker 1: They have a lot of March and in here, but that's because they're.

405
00:31:47,337 --> 00:31:48,060
Speaker 0: he's an ass.

406
00:31:49,182 --> 00:31:50,972
Speaker 0: Using him as an example, maybe they're not.

407
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,299
Speaker 0: they're probably not a Bruins fan.

408
00:31:52,507 --> 00:31:59,600
Speaker 1: Yeah They use him as an example of The player who tricks you into starting a fight and then go but walks away and you just get a penalty for nothing.

409
00:32:00,121 --> 00:32:00,842
Speaker 0: Yeah scumbag.

410
00:32:01,163 --> 00:32:14,713
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what this video does is in ten minutes it Explains in a humorous way, but actually like in a really really accurate way what the actual Unwritten rules are for fighting in hockey.

411
00:32:14,773 --> 00:32:29,020
Speaker 1: So if you watch this video You'll understand why sometimes the refs break up a fight and why sometimes they don't like When fights get broken up how they get broken up and why like this video is actually really detailed and accurate.

412
00:32:29,522 --> 00:32:30,004
Speaker 1: So what you got?

413
00:32:30,607 --> 00:32:42,418
Speaker 0: Oh, so, you know our favorite word the f-word The most common word said in New York Yeah, supposedly according to scotsman calm and according to this new TV doc.

414
00:32:42,438 --> 00:32:44,248
Speaker 1: Wait a minute Scottsman calm.

415
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:45,939
Speaker 1: did a Scotsman write this?

416
00:32:46,783 --> 00:32:47,125
Speaker 0: Maybe?

417
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:52,807
Speaker 0: and also according to a BBC Scotland documentary still biased.

418
00:32:53,409 --> 00:32:54,553
Speaker 0: I sure hope this isn't like.

419
00:32:54,593 --> 00:32:56,520
Speaker 0: it seems to be a real news site, right?

420
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,092
Speaker 0: This isn't one of those like fake Scottish news things.

421
00:32:59,855 --> 00:33:00,699
Speaker 0: It seems real to me.

422
00:33:01,101 --> 00:33:04,435
Speaker 1: I mean, no very few listeners called me out on a fake Scottish news.

423
00:33:04,496 --> 00:33:05,460
Speaker 1: I talked about a while ago.

424
00:33:05,621 --> 00:33:07,915
Speaker 0: That was uh, oh that was also Scottish.

425
00:33:08,035 --> 00:33:12,523
Speaker 0: Yes Can't trust these Scottish Scotts, right?

426
00:33:12,844 --> 00:33:19,485
Speaker 1: the one time I took the piss and like one person messaged me and they're like, uh There's no way that's true.

427
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:19,806
Speaker 1: Is it?

428
00:33:19,826 --> 00:33:35,517
Speaker 0: and I was like, no, no anyway the point is According to this there used to be a thing called flighting or fleeting Which is basically a poetry duel or like a you know, a 16th century rap battle.

429
00:33:35,678 --> 00:33:37,847
Speaker 0: Whoo It's how they describe it.

430
00:33:38,028 --> 00:33:39,535
Speaker 1: I want to find a historic or an actor.

431
00:33:39,555 --> 00:33:40,379
Speaker 1: I want to see one of these.

432
00:33:41,482 --> 00:33:57,680
Speaker 0: but anyway in one such battle the flighting of Dunbar and Kennedy right in which which is a written account of The flighting that they had so it's like Dunbar and Kennedy had a rap battle a poetry battle, right?

433
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:11,139
Speaker 0: Dunbar wrote down an account of it and in that account is supposedly the oldest known written You know occurrence of the word fuck.

434
00:34:12,243 --> 00:34:25,469
Speaker 0: That if true is amazing Some very juicy language and points out one of the insults traded between the two poets was the phrase one fuck it fun ling Which is probably not how that's pronounced.

435
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:28,480
Speaker 0: We need a Scottish person to pronounce it, right?

436
00:34:30,603 --> 00:34:33,619
Speaker 0: But yeah, if true this is fascinating and great.

437
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,891
Speaker 1: It's my most commonly it's all there is - it's very important word.

438
00:34:38,675 --> 00:34:45,723
Speaker 1: Yeah, I use it So in the meta moment of geek night sounds a little weird I guess.

439
00:34:45,822 --> 00:34:48,114
Speaker 1: we've said before we were doing the show remotely.

440
00:34:48,134 --> 00:34:52,109
Speaker 1: as of today We are now live streaming the show remotely.

441
00:34:52,168 --> 00:34:57,392
Speaker 1: that was more annoying to set up than you realize And I hope you well.

442
00:34:57,412 --> 00:34:58,620
Speaker 1: there are 12 people watching this.

443
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,544
Speaker 1: So I think you were.

444
00:34:59,565 --> 00:35:02,559
Speaker 1: I think some people are hungry for the live streams to come back.

445
00:35:04,763 --> 00:35:07,119
Speaker 1: The book club book, we're not reading books for playing video games.

446
00:35:08,146 --> 00:35:10,144
Speaker 1: all that Hold on.

447
00:35:10,184 --> 00:35:11,387
Speaker 0: I'm reading comic books.

448
00:35:11,848 --> 00:35:12,089
Speaker 1: Yep.

449
00:35:12,651 --> 00:35:15,438
Speaker 1: I'm mostly playing video games and reading nonfiction.

450
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:18,128
Speaker 1: I started You know that shattered sword book.

451
00:35:18,248 --> 00:35:19,254
Speaker 1: now that Chris is reading it.

452
00:35:19,374 --> 00:35:20,520
Speaker 1: I reread a chapter of it.

453
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,849
Speaker 1: That was a particularly good chapter.

454
00:35:21,889 --> 00:35:25,866
Speaker 1: So that's where I'm at in terms of books In terms of meta.

455
00:35:25,946 --> 00:35:34,760
Speaker 0: I want to remind people that we have a semi official Geek night's Discord server that you can come to and we do some streams there.

456
00:35:34,921 --> 00:35:37,674
Speaker 0: They're low effort streams because it's way easier to do.

457
00:35:37,795 --> 00:35:39,886
Speaker 0: then you go on Twitch Which is a big time.

458
00:35:39,906 --> 00:35:42,380
Speaker 0: you know our YouTube which is a big time investment.

459
00:35:42,702 --> 00:35:45,639
Speaker 1: It's more like you want to hang out in the room with like me or Scott.

460
00:35:45,659 --> 00:35:47,960
Speaker 1: well Like I'm just playing XCOM or something, right?

461
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:48,720
Speaker 0: It's like I'm playing.

462
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:56,839
Speaker 0: civilization might as well click this one button that will make a stream happen and then if you can join in with a voice chat And you can even stream your own game or whatever, right?

463
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,355
Speaker 0: I also want to remind people we have a forum.

464
00:36:00,656 --> 00:36:14,359
Speaker 0: that's on our website community.frontrecruit.com and I want to remind people that there's an official geek night's newsletter, which is the kind of thing that you have time to Remember about that when you got nothing else to do.

465
00:36:15,681 --> 00:36:18,149
Speaker 1: We do our other secret project of the other writing thing.

466
00:36:18,871 --> 00:36:19,853
Speaker 0: Yes, there are secret.

467
00:36:19,934 --> 00:36:22,847
Speaker 0: basically the geek night's newsletter is basically Secret.

468
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:31,542
Speaker 0: emails that I write only go to 300 or so people that are subscribed to it probably a small percentage of who read it and You can.

469
00:36:31,603 --> 00:36:38,291
Speaker 0: actually there's actually a public archive of it that you can read the old emails But you know no one pays attention to it.

470
00:36:38,352 --> 00:36:42,393
Speaker 0: I write it rarely, but if I'm stuck at home Yeah, got nothing else to do.

471
00:36:42,676 --> 00:36:47,560
Speaker 1: similarly I'm restarting my Rims-Rants where I did the Friday geek nights on the patreon, so I'm gonna.

472
00:36:47,782 --> 00:36:49,798
Speaker 1: I'm starting those up again this week.

473
00:36:51,462 --> 00:36:53,049
Speaker 0: Got time to not cherish.

474
00:36:53,431 --> 00:36:55,279
Speaker 1: Yep must spend must waste it.

475
00:36:56,904 --> 00:36:57,468
Speaker 1: I must kill it.

476
00:36:58,072 --> 00:36:59,100
Speaker 1: Mustn't kill time boy.

477
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:07,060
Speaker 1: I find as I get older unless I rewatch the Simpsons I start to lose my precise Simpsons quoting abilities, and I get more generic.

478
00:37:07,261 --> 00:37:07,523
Speaker 1: I gotta.

479
00:37:07,583 --> 00:37:10,440

480
00:37:11,102 --> 00:37:13,550
Speaker 0: I remember more quotes, and I forget like like.

481
00:37:13,691 --> 00:37:15,537
Speaker 0: I know you know mustn't kill time boy.

Speaker 0: I couldn't tell you what episode it was.

486
00:37:20,232 --> 00:37:21,879
Speaker 0: I couldn't tell you which old man said it.

487
00:37:22,522 --> 00:37:27,765
Speaker 1: Oh, see I do remember the A plot and the B plots and where they line up though There's a occasional gaps.

488
00:37:28,005 --> 00:37:33,162
Speaker 1: past season seven like I forgot that a bunch of choice lines Were in.

489
00:37:33,242 --> 00:37:39,600
Speaker 1: the Homer learns how to box with Moe and I also forgot it ends with that montage of Moe saving everybody with the fan.

490
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,771
Speaker 1: Okay, you don't remember this at all do you?

491
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:43,636
Speaker 0: Nope.

492
00:37:43,918 --> 00:37:50,236
Speaker 1: Wow Homer boxes Mike Tyson and Don King is in it, but it's not Mike Tyson and Don King that one.

493
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:52,960
Speaker 1: okay Yeah, they used to call me kid gorgeous.

494
00:37:55,401 --> 00:37:56,867
Speaker 1: So yeah follow us and all the stuff.

495
00:37:56,927 --> 00:37:59,075
Speaker 1: watch our YouTube channels, we're doing more and more.

496
00:37:59,155 --> 00:38:00,340
Speaker 1: we're streaming again bit by bit.

497
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:04,291
Speaker 1: We're gonna crank out more and more content, but now something amazing happened.

498
00:38:04,311 --> 00:38:22,238
Speaker 1: both Scott and I are playing an Animal Crossing game which I Was aware that Animal Crossing existed But for much of my adult life I've all I knew was it's the game Where you just talk to animals in a little town and I didn't really know anything else about it

499
00:38:23,383 --> 00:38:23,504
Speaker 0: Right.

500
00:38:23,524 --> 00:38:33,250
Speaker 0: Well, I mean so Animal Crossing First appeared on the GameCube right and when it came out It was like the one first party in Nintendo GameCube game that I didn't go for.

501
00:38:34,461 --> 00:38:37,840
Speaker 1: Well, it came out on the n64, but I don't think that one came out in the US.

502
00:38:38,342 --> 00:38:49,012
Speaker 0: No, so actually so that the real story is in Japan the original one which I think is called it's like The Japanese name is like dobutsu something cuz dobutsu is animal.

503
00:38:49,052 --> 00:38:49,734
Speaker 0: Yep, right.

504
00:38:49,834 --> 00:38:51,800
Speaker 0: It's like dobutsu something which means forest.

505
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,747
Speaker 0: I think it's animal forest and not crossing.

506
00:38:53,867 --> 00:38:58,823
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is that original n64 one was Japan only.

507
00:38:58,843 --> 00:39:03,060
Speaker 1: Yep, and then enhanced and released with new right hand on the GameCube, right?

508
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:11,238
Speaker 0: Then they made it like a. it was like an upgraded version on the GameCube But that upgraded version on the GameCube is what the original US release was.

509
00:39:11,298 --> 00:39:16,080
Speaker 1: Yep Similar shenanigans happened with some of the early advance Wars games like similar stuff went down.

510
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:21,484
Speaker 0: It's similar to what happened with the Zelda game that came out on GameCube and Wii.

511
00:39:21,966 --> 00:39:22,708
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

512
00:39:22,728 --> 00:39:23,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

513
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,653
Speaker 0: Was that Twilight Princess?

514
00:39:24,713 --> 00:39:28,234
Speaker 0: I think yeah, I'm on GameCube and we you know I never finished that one here.

515
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:36,200
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway So Yeah, but what I knew about Animal Crossing was this I knew that it was a game.

516
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,840
Speaker 0: We're like you're a person who gets made it to be the mayor of a village.

517
00:39:40,361 --> 00:39:52,583
Speaker 0: You have to pay off debts and you do lots of basically no skill busy work right collecting and selling fruit Playing some sort of turnip stock market game fishing Collecting stuff.

518
00:39:52,703 --> 00:39:53,386
Speaker 0: Yep, right.

519
00:39:53,787 --> 00:39:58,202
Speaker 0: I was sort of just like and I knew character busy work collecting kind of game Like I knew.

520
00:39:58,222 --> 00:40:08,383
Speaker 1: I knew there's Tom Nook because people would talk about Tom Nook a lot like Animal Crossing was widely Represented in my social media and like in the wider gaming spaces I inhabited.

521
00:40:08,443 --> 00:40:13,718
Speaker 1: even though I did not play it myself and I didn't really know a lot of people who played it I would encounter it kind of often.

522
00:40:14,741 --> 00:40:17,872
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, I mean I knew and you know enough about it tangentially.

523
00:40:17,972 --> 00:40:20,220
Speaker 0: I just never actually played one.

524
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:24,959
Speaker 0: Yep, right because I didn't feel like I needed to because I knew I felt I knew what kind of game it was.

525
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:29,555
Speaker 0: Yeah, so but the new one came out which I probably also wasn't planning to buy.

526
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:38,700
Speaker 0: I didn't buy on the first day But we're stuck inside and there's nothing else to do and all our friends are playing it like everyone's literally everyone's playing it.

527
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:43,980
Speaker 0: So I'm like well when in Rome, whatever I'll do this for a while and then I'll stop right but

528
00:40:44,061 --> 00:40:57,254
Speaker 1: also partly because like a lot of our friends who were playing it are really into it like the people who like Animal Crossing Really like it and while we had tangential knowledge of it I feel like it's worth at least exploring and like playing what this game actually is.

529
00:40:57,274 --> 00:41:01,487
Speaker 0: and so I did play The Animal Crossing actually on iOS.

530
00:41:02,008 --> 00:41:03,974
Speaker 0: the happy whatever right?

531
00:41:04,114 --> 00:41:04,976
Speaker 0: wasn't that game?

532
00:41:05,277 --> 00:41:06,240
Speaker 1: mobile game though?

533
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, no actually it wasn't really much of a game.

534
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,348
Speaker 0: It wasn't really much like Animal Crossing for real.

535
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:18,834
Speaker 0: basically all it was is Animal Crossing styled game where you can decorate your little area right.

536
00:41:18,894 --> 00:41:30,810
Speaker 0: it was all about decorating your area and The way to decorate the area was like basically pay money right there wasn't all the like this Do task wise really.

537
00:41:31,211 --> 00:41:39,059
Speaker 1: so I guess if I had to describe Animal Crossing Well, we're gonna review now because the only game we ever played is New Horizons, which we're playing actively.

538
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:44,403
Speaker 1: now We've played another reviewing the old ones yep, but if I had to describe this game just as a reviewer.

539
00:41:44,503 --> 00:41:45,506
Speaker 1: I would say that it is.

540
00:41:46,369 --> 00:41:51,785
Speaker 1: it is a game about talking to animals and making them happy and everything else kind of.

541
00:41:51,805 --> 00:42:00,158
Speaker 1: and I will talk to animals try to make them happy while curating your little animal village and Slowly investing in it and then customizing it.

542
00:42:00,962 --> 00:42:05,380
Speaker 0: I think it's more basically just the world's most advanced cookie clicker.

543
00:42:06,884 --> 00:42:09,091
Speaker 0: So you think about some of that going on right.

544
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:16,019
Speaker 0: so cookie clicker you click and you get stuff Right and you click and you get stuff and then eventually get enough stuff that you can buy.

545
00:42:16,663 --> 00:42:22,385
Speaker 0: Something the same could be said of all Diablo games sure But there's no.

546
00:42:22,425 --> 00:42:23,190
Speaker 0: there's no skill.

547
00:42:23,391 --> 00:42:25,060
Speaker 0: There's very little skill to the clicking.

548
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,104
Speaker 0: Yeah There's some.

549
00:42:26,164 --> 00:42:26,909
Speaker 0: there's medicine.

550
00:42:26,929 --> 00:42:39,560
Speaker 1: the skill mess up catching a fish now And then the skill is more like the people who get to get into this game Will learn techniques and have patterns and like fastest pads to paying off debts and make charts to figure out a turnip market.

551
00:42:39,901 --> 00:42:40,624
Speaker 0: It's just simple.

552
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,607
Speaker 0: It's just simple.

553
00:42:41,788 --> 00:42:44,980
Speaker 0: You know an extra layer of management of the clicks, right?

554
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:49,020
Speaker 0: It's not based on your skill right of pushing buttons is what I'm right.

555
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,465
Speaker 0: It's just you get you.

556
00:42:50,686 --> 00:42:51,890
Speaker 0: the trees grow fruit.

557
00:42:52,392 --> 00:42:54,580
Speaker 0: some things are like an idle game.

558
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,806
Speaker 0: They're time based.

559
00:42:55,827 --> 00:43:02,316
Speaker 0: you wait for the fruit to grow and then you write Yeah, but you have to because the game is attached to a real-time clock.

560
00:43:02,537 --> 00:43:05,168
Speaker 0: unless you cheat You know you have to pick.

561
00:43:05,188 --> 00:43:07,000
Speaker 0: you have to be on top of it, right?

562
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:13,916
Speaker 0: You have to pick your fruit when it gets ready sort of like You know the real-time submarine game.

563
00:43:14,237 --> 00:43:17,599
Speaker 1: oh, yes Subterfuge yeah, right.

564
00:43:17,982 --> 00:43:28,160
Speaker 0: But I kind of like that in one sense like when I first want to sell your fruit on a different island Your native fruit on a different island to get more money and sell your other fruits locally to get more money, right?

565
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,549
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, there's a bunch of like sort of meta games within like.

566
00:43:30,569 --> 00:43:32,839
Speaker 1: there's the cookie clicker aspect of get all the stuff.

567
00:43:33,322 --> 00:43:42,740
Speaker 1: then there's the like more of a playground like Lego aspect of Super customize your island because that's like the endgame like just make yes, but they it feeds into each other.

568
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,120
Speaker 0: You can't super customize your island if you don't have enough money.

569
00:43:46,301 --> 00:43:47,886
Speaker 0: Yep, right you need to get.

570
00:43:47,906 --> 00:43:52,040
Speaker 0: you need to play the game of grinding away at the different lanes, right?

571
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,044
Speaker 0: You can grind it fish.

572
00:43:53,445 --> 00:43:54,791
Speaker 0: You can grind it seashells.

573
00:43:54,831 --> 00:43:59,880
Speaker 0: You can grind at tree at farming Yeah, you can grind at the turnip stock market.

574
00:44:00,261 --> 00:44:02,069
Speaker 1: But then there's this other parallel game of.

575
00:44:02,089 --> 00:44:07,399
Speaker 1: you can grind at bug catching as you meet new villagers And get them to move into your island bit by bit and they come and go.

576
00:44:07,882 --> 00:44:16,778
Speaker 1: You can try to learn what each one's deal is because they all have like a pretty particular Deal and based on how they react and you give him right gifts and try to make him happy and like.

577
00:44:16,798 --> 00:44:18,316
Speaker 1: there's a whole like side game there.

578
00:44:19,961 --> 00:44:28,498
Speaker 1: Mmm, I guess I don't pay attention to that too much because it's like, you know I really want my villagers to like me and I really try to come up with like specific gifts based on.

579
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,751
Speaker 1: like My bird bro was like he.

580
00:44:30,832 --> 00:44:33,645
Speaker 1: every time I talked to him for two days He was like complaining of it.

581
00:44:33,705 --> 00:44:34,428
Speaker 1: I can't catch fish.

582
00:44:34,689 --> 00:44:37,779
Speaker 1: So I gave him some bait and he got really fucking jazzed about it.

583
00:44:38,322 --> 00:44:38,584
Speaker 0: Okay.

584
00:44:39,187 --> 00:44:47,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like I mostly like, you know, I Other people seem to really want particular villagers to move because some of them are ugly or weird or terrifying.

585
00:44:47,321 --> 00:44:48,545
Speaker 0: They're kicking out villagers.

586
00:44:48,586 --> 00:44:50,072
Speaker 0: They don't like for me.

587
00:44:50,212 --> 00:44:52,160
Speaker 0: All the villagers seem kind of equal in man.

588
00:44:52,221 --> 00:44:53,718
Speaker 0: I don't really care about any of them.

589
00:44:54,001 --> 00:44:54,442
Speaker 1: I like a few.

590
00:44:54,462 --> 00:44:54,744
Speaker 1: I like.

591
00:44:54,824 --> 00:44:59,383
Speaker 0: I like the choice like the list of all villagers and like none of them were like Like.

592
00:44:59,503 --> 00:45:00,768
Speaker 0: oh man, that's a great villager.

593
00:45:00,788 --> 00:45:01,832
Speaker 1: I there's a few.

594
00:45:01,872 --> 00:45:02,153
Speaker 1: I like.

595
00:45:02,214 --> 00:45:04,462
Speaker 1: Isabelle's pretty chill, but she's not really a villager She's special.

596
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:05,746
Speaker 0: No, it's like I have.

597
00:45:06,087 --> 00:45:09,158
Speaker 0: one of the ones I got immediately was puck the hockey playing penguin.

598
00:45:09,238 --> 00:45:11,385
Speaker 0: Oh, I want him He's okay.

599
00:45:11,425 --> 00:45:12,870
Speaker 0: He's you know, I guess he's maybe the.

600
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:13,593
Speaker 0: I guess the two.

601
00:45:13,653 --> 00:45:21,740
Speaker 1: I started like I got plucky Who's just like chill and see I got deep down for whatever and I got the bird bro Pierce the lift weightlifting guy.

602
00:45:22,644 --> 00:45:27,651
Speaker 0: I have a. I have a bird bro who likes Exercising but I don't think his name is Pierce.

603
00:45:27,912 --> 00:45:28,556
Speaker 1: I forget their names.

604
00:45:28,576 --> 00:45:29,100
Speaker 1: I think it's Pierce.

605
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,812
Speaker 1: I don't know the Animal Crossing characters names me either but that's so.

606
00:45:33,073 --> 00:45:35,681
Speaker 0: I guess I'm not really care too much about that part of The game.

607
00:45:35,701 --> 00:45:52,603
Speaker 0: I guess it's just you want to eventually get the maximum number of houses onto your island full of People because that's how you like get to the end game of the k/k slider concert, I guess If there is such a thing as Pierce Right.

608
00:45:52,623 --> 00:46:00,820
Speaker 0: It's like the game provides for you this path of Upgrading stuff where you get you you actually get the stuff then you pay off the loan afterwards.

609
00:46:01,463 --> 00:46:04,920
Speaker 0: But you don't have to pay off the loan because there's no interest and there's no due date.

610
00:46:05,201 --> 00:46:07,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, everybody's about Tom Nook wanton bells.

611
00:46:07,691 --> 00:46:09,820
Speaker 1: He doesn't want that many bells.

612
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:15,510
Speaker 0: You could get a loan for your house upgrade it and literally never pay off that loan if you're satisfied with the current state of Your house.

613
00:46:15,776 --> 00:46:18,179
Speaker 0: Yep So that's like if I like in the real world.

614
00:46:18,341 --> 00:46:25,898
Speaker 0: Imagine like if I got a loan and bought a car and they said alright You only need to pay off that loan if you want to actually get a loan to buy a better car.

615
00:46:25,938 --> 00:46:31,928
Speaker 0: if you're satisfied with that car never pay the loan and Will be never charge your interest or come after you.

616
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:35,100
Speaker 0: it's like oh, so the lowest level car is free is what you're saying.

617
00:46:35,201 --> 00:46:37,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the third is amazing.

618
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:40,653
Speaker 0: Oh, you are I suspect the price of one lower level car.

619
00:46:40,713 --> 00:46:51,808
Speaker 0: if you could have you would have stayed in the tent forever Like you could pay off the price of your Honda Civic and then you'll give you a loan for a mercy for a Mercedes or a BMW and you could just not pay that off.

620
00:46:51,828 --> 00:47:01,340
Speaker 1: but I love you could how Tom Nook will like give me the loan But then I could deposit the entirety of what I owe him into my savings account and he'll pay me interest.

621
00:47:02,788 --> 00:47:05,625
Speaker 0: Yeah It's it's kind of.

622
00:47:05,706 --> 00:47:06,712
Speaker 0: it's not a real saying.

623
00:47:06,752 --> 00:47:07,195
Speaker 1: there's villages.

624
00:47:07,215 --> 00:47:07,617
Speaker 1: You're like what?

625
00:47:07,657 --> 00:47:10,548
Speaker 1: Oh Matilda She looks angry and she's got.

626
00:47:10,588 --> 00:47:14,260
Speaker 1: she's a kangaroo and she's got a little baby in her pouch who also looks angry.

627
00:47:14,823 --> 00:47:19,306
Speaker 0: I'm just saying none of the villagers particularly appeal to me like I'm oh man I want that one in my village.

628
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:20,452
Speaker 1: I can see.

629
00:47:20,532 --> 00:47:22,020
Speaker 1: I definitely see some I do not want.

630
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:25,251
Speaker 0: All right, they all seem kind of equal to me.

631
00:47:25,411 --> 00:47:26,315
Speaker 0: I'm not excited.

632
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:27,380
Speaker 1: Lopez looks pretty good.

633
00:47:28,414 --> 00:47:38,285
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, so if you're someone who wants a video game that you know is it's not a completely an idle game like a candy Box because you have to do stuff.

634
00:47:38,987 --> 00:47:51,660
Speaker 0: It's not completely a cookie clicker because the stuff you're doing has a little bit of Thinking and paying attention, you know Just click mindlessly like you have to push a when the the bait on the end of the fishing rod starts to shake, right?

635
00:47:51,941 --> 00:47:54,611
Speaker 0: You have to sneak up on the bug and catch it.

636
00:47:54,631 --> 00:47:58,162
Speaker 0: You have two different bugs work different ways sometimes Right.

637
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:04,692
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, it's a. there's some definitely a lot of lottery aspects to it to keep you be You know the human mind trapped.

638
00:48:04,752 --> 00:48:05,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I guess things are rare.

639
00:48:06,121 --> 00:48:06,783
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what I?

640
00:48:06,803 --> 00:48:12,409
Speaker 0: there's a lot of gotcha aspects to it as in not as in got you as in got you But gotcha, I got you on.

641
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:19,465
Speaker 1: but I guess what draws me to it Like what I think its main strength is like on a real meta level is that it's a game about mooching around like you've got This world.

642
00:48:19,485 --> 00:48:22,787
Speaker 1: you can kind of move around in it and there's a lot of different paths.

643
00:48:22,807 --> 00:48:29,307
Speaker 1: like the lanes you were talking about all those different lanes and pads are Reasonably satisfying to fuss with on their own.

644
00:48:29,808 --> 00:48:41,220
Speaker 1: So if you're just idle or bored or like it's evening you're laying in bed It's just a very calming chill game to go Like let's go talk to my villagers and chop some wood or I think that's that's the main thing in this game.

645
00:48:41,421 --> 00:48:47,440
Speaker 0: Is that you know, even in those other like idle games I mentioned, right?

646
00:48:47,803 --> 00:48:50,320
Speaker 0: There is still some kind of like pressure.

647
00:48:50,581 --> 00:48:59,872
Speaker 0: It's either pressure from the back right trying to make you go forward Right, like you're playing you're playing cookie candy box.

648
00:49:00,012 --> 00:49:05,379
Speaker 0: It's like well, alright, you got nothing going on right now You got to go go go get more candies get more lollipops, right?

649
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:12,467
Speaker 0: Or if you're playing a normal at your average video game as pressure from the front you turn on Mario Brothers The goob is coming at you.

650
00:49:12,587 --> 00:49:12,809
Speaker 0: Yep.

651
00:49:13,311 --> 00:49:14,438
Speaker 0: You got to do something.

652
00:49:14,962 --> 00:49:18,889
Speaker 0: Are you Even Super Mario Brothers right?

653
00:49:18,949 --> 00:49:19,772
Speaker 0: or pac-man?

654
00:49:19,812 --> 00:49:22,400
Speaker 0: the ghost is coming at you do something, right?

655
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:27,760
Speaker 0: You have to do things, you know, the game is attacking you in Animal Crossing.

656
00:49:28,242 --> 00:49:30,651
Speaker 0: There is no pressure from the front or back.

657
00:49:31,052 --> 00:49:37,840
Speaker 0: You can go forward if you want But like I said, the loans have no interest and no due date.

658
00:49:38,091 --> 00:49:42,152
Speaker 0: Yeah You can just move forward at any pace you like.

659
00:49:42,252 --> 00:49:54,499
Speaker 0: if you don't want a bigger house if you don't want Progress and get more stuff if you don't have to no one's making you do anything Yeah, you can just chill and play in the space that has been provided for you.

660
00:49:55,041 --> 00:50:02,260
Speaker 0: Right, and if you choose to do more stuff at whatever pace you do it at you will get more stuff eventually.

661
00:50:02,962 --> 00:50:04,947
Speaker 0: Right, there's no time limit.

662
00:50:05,248 --> 00:50:07,092
Speaker 0: There's no losing right.

663
00:50:07,232 --> 00:50:11,900
Speaker 0: even if you only like sell your fruit once a week Eventually, you'll pay off the loan.

664
00:50:12,081 --> 00:50:18,815
Speaker 1: the worst thing that can happen to you is you get stung by wasps twice or by a Tarantula once and pass out and it's like.

665
00:50:18,835 --> 00:50:23,780
Speaker 0: it's like, you know Some people like so upset that they pass out and I'm like, I don't even care if a wasp gets me.

666
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:27,560
Speaker 0: What happens like teleport a few feet away in two seconds and I could right.

667
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:37,965
Speaker 0: so I think the good aspect of this game is that and also the I guess it's simultaneously awesome, but also Unrealized potential.

668
00:50:37,985 --> 00:50:42,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, is that the previous Animal Crossing games had multiplayer components?

669
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,546
Speaker 0: I think I'm not sure.

670
00:50:44,606 --> 00:50:49,365
Speaker 0: but I think the GameCube one used the online connector on the game Might.

671
00:50:49,405 --> 00:50:52,880
Speaker 0: I don't know about that for sure, but I think I remember it doing that.

672
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,726
Speaker 0: I don't not a hundred percent this one.

673
00:50:54,767 --> 00:50:57,878
Speaker 0: Yes, the switch DS had the local wireless connectivity.

674
00:50:57,918 --> 00:51:00,675
Speaker 0: It never worked Right, it worked.

675
00:51:00,897 --> 00:51:05,672
Speaker 0: barely The DS wanted anyway, but then this one it had.

676
00:51:05,733 --> 00:51:08,704
Speaker 0: if you have Nintendo online it has Internet.

677
00:51:09,105 --> 00:51:10,934
Speaker 0: that sucks but works.

678
00:51:10,974 --> 00:51:16,575
Speaker 1: Yep, like it actually does work I've gone to other people's islands and boots around and then gone back to my caveman Island.

679
00:51:16,595 --> 00:51:17,137
Speaker 1: cuz I'm taking.

680
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:20,920
Speaker 1: I'm playing the game Much more casually than a lot of our other friends, right?

681
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:36,080
Speaker 0: So like you and this when it works, right the parts of it that do work work great and that you can sort of Experience this sort of like childlike Play with dolls Situations together, but that's it.

682
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:36,401
Speaker 1: Like.

683
00:51:36,421 --> 00:51:37,906
Speaker 1: the way I'm experiencing this game is.

684
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:48,090
Speaker 1: I'm just making this little village and like I'm putting trees in my house in a way That feels aesthetic for no particular reason and it's exactly the kind of mooching around play I would do with Legos as a kid, right?

685
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,416
Speaker 0: Everyone's got a dollhouse.

686
00:51:49,516 --> 00:51:50,340
Speaker 0: That's a whole island.

687
00:51:50,903 --> 00:51:53,396
Speaker 0: Right, you can customize yours as much as you want.

688
00:51:53,798 --> 00:51:56,044
Speaker 0: you can Visit other people's.

689
00:51:56,064 --> 00:51:57,067
Speaker 0: they can visit yours.

690
00:51:57,227 --> 00:51:57,809
Speaker 0: Oh, right.

691
00:51:57,849 --> 00:51:58,952
Speaker 0: You can do stuff together.

692
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:00,176
Speaker 0: Some parts are automatic.

693
00:52:00,216 --> 00:52:01,862
Speaker 0: some part are still a game Right.

694
00:52:01,882 --> 00:52:04,211
Speaker 0: It's like I could throw a fish bait and you can catch the fish.

695
00:52:04,713 --> 00:52:08,069
Speaker 0: All right, you could be like, hey Let's both chop down trees here.

696
00:52:08,089 --> 00:52:09,839
Speaker 0: Well, it'll we'll get it done twice as fast.

697
00:52:10,563 --> 00:52:19,660
Speaker 0: All right, there's all sorts like these things you can do Together with other people in a in a in a true social way not like a fake social way.

698
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:24,520
Speaker 0: Yep, well like look at our farm bill a farm bill social way, right which is bullshit, right?

699
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,208
Speaker 0: Yeah, where as Animal Crossing is like?

700
00:52:26,249 --> 00:52:28,799
Speaker 0: no you guys saw people in Animal Crossing for example.

701
00:52:29,321 --> 00:52:35,560
Speaker 0: They went to a friend's island all together and they went to the museum and they took photos together in the museum.

702
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:40,838
Speaker 0: Yep, right and they went just as if they were going to a real museum or like you see people will like.

703
00:52:41,038 --> 00:52:46,460
Speaker 1: well like our Friends right now they're making spreadsheets and tracking the stock market and like coordinating investments.

704
00:52:46,661 --> 00:52:53,700
Speaker 1: Like there's a lot of ways to have fun with this game No matter what you want to do because it's still the same shield all house, right?

705
00:52:53,740 --> 00:53:04,124
Speaker 0: You can do whatever if you're into house customizing if you're into just the fishing right the collecting part you can do whatever part you want at any pace you want and It's alright.

706
00:53:04,708 --> 00:53:13,037
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it is magical that this game came out during our current crisis because I think this game came out at the exact right time.

707
00:53:13,057 --> 00:53:15,446
Speaker 0: this this Came out at any other time.

708
00:53:15,506 --> 00:53:18,820
Speaker 0: I wouldn't have even bought it or a bit like another Animal Crossing game out.

709
00:53:18,881 --> 00:53:19,551
Speaker 0: Okay, whatever.

710
00:53:19,917 --> 00:53:25,688
Speaker 1: Yep But this is I think a lot of people are gonna get in for the first time and also honestly for kids This game is great.

711
00:53:25,768 --> 00:53:26,753
Speaker 1: This is just a kind of game.

712
00:53:26,773 --> 00:53:29,803
Speaker 1: You can park it get in front of forever and It's fine.

713
00:53:29,843 --> 00:53:31,350
Speaker 1: Like what they're doing in this game is fine.

714
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:32,716
Speaker 1: They'll learn they'll have fun.

715
00:53:32,757 --> 00:53:33,480
Speaker 1: They'll poke around.

716
00:53:33,801 --> 00:53:35,468
Speaker 1: It's not that different than what they do with their toys.

717
00:53:36,131 --> 00:53:38,460
Speaker 0: It's definitely I think for some people it's good.

718
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,455
Speaker 0: It's their main game.

719
00:53:40,181 --> 00:53:41,626
Speaker 0: For me I see it more of.

720
00:53:41,967 --> 00:53:49,153
Speaker 0: it's my game right now because the situation right now a long run It's like it's basically always your backup game.

721
00:53:49,193 --> 00:53:58,225
Speaker 1: Like I would I feel like years from now I'll just like poke in and like poke at my island a little bit and go see what someone else's islands do in and then Just turn it off right?

722
00:53:58,285 --> 00:54:02,500
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, if you if you're it's like I did, you know, I played my serious game.

723
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,406
Speaker 0: I played my multiplayer game.

724
00:54:04,426 --> 00:54:09,541
Speaker 0: I did all the stuff that I'm really into and now I'm just chilling for a minute All right.

725
00:54:09,561 --> 00:54:11,066
Speaker 0: Well see what's on my island.

726
00:54:11,107 --> 00:54:13,976
Speaker 0: I'll pick some weeds sell some fruit and save.

727
00:54:14,317 --> 00:54:17,449
Speaker 1: there is one Very big problem with this game though.

728
00:54:18,392 --> 00:54:26,320
Speaker 1: If you have multiple players in your household You cannot have two independent games unless you have two independent switches, right?

729
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,343
Speaker 0: Well, you sort of can.

730
00:54:27,543 --> 00:54:30,633
Speaker 1: right is that you can't drive the game forward.

731
00:54:30,653 --> 00:54:33,060
Speaker 1: You can only drive your own house upgrades forward.

732
00:54:33,322 --> 00:54:34,008
Speaker 1: You can't write.

733
00:54:34,069 --> 00:54:35,420
Speaker 1: any other events happen on the island.

734
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:38,880
Speaker 0: So me and rim had one switch in the house and we both live together.

735
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:51,870
Speaker 0: One the first person to turn the game on and start the game is the person who like is the village representative Person who has to pay off, you know The the loans and move the main plot of the game forward.

736
00:54:51,890 --> 00:55:04,940
Speaker 0: the other person can still do all the stuff fishing Give things to the museum right You know all stuff right they can play the game, but they can't drive the main game forward.

737
00:55:05,422 --> 00:55:13,877
Speaker 0: they would have to share their resources with the main person so that they could then Use those efforts towards driving the game forward.

738
00:55:13,897 --> 00:55:15,524
Speaker 0: Yep Which is a

739
00:55:15,584 --> 00:55:15,886
Speaker 1: real

740
00:55:15,926 --> 00:55:23,042
Speaker 0: sort of all living together and working together in the same place But one person is in charge running the show Which is

741
00:55:23,102 --> 00:55:28,588
Speaker 1: a real shame because if you have like someone who has more than one kid Which kid gets to be the primary player?

742
00:55:28,608 --> 00:55:31,076
Speaker 1: because I'm not buying two switches like that is right.

743
00:55:31,156 --> 00:55:33,671
Speaker 0: that has caused big Copies of the game.

744
00:55:34,035 --> 00:55:34,420
Speaker 1: you can't know.

745
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:42,097
Speaker 1: Okay, even if you have two separate cartridges it stores everything in the switch so you can study.

746
00:55:42,217 --> 00:55:44,723
Speaker 0: you can't even put on the SD Card if it switches D cards.

747
00:55:44,784 --> 00:55:52,280
Speaker 1: Nope, if you if I give you my cart and And then you give me your switch and we hand it to a third person and they start a game.

748
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:54,076
Speaker 1: They'll be on your island because it's your switch.

749
00:55:54,953 --> 00:56:02,775
Speaker 0: Okay but anyway But yeah, sometimes that situation of being on the same island could be correct.

750
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:04,360
Speaker 0: right like you could imagine a family.

751
00:56:04,741 --> 00:56:09,320
Speaker 0: We're like a four-person family and they all have houses on the island and they all work together.

752
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:13,720
Speaker 1: Like Emily just moved into my island and we just kind of hang out and do the thing, but it's like that could be cool.

753
00:56:13,861 --> 00:56:18,036
Speaker 0: But sometimes it's not what you want if it's two adults living in the house.

754
00:56:18,076 --> 00:56:19,200
Speaker 0: They both want their own islands.

755
00:56:19,261 --> 00:56:33,770
Speaker 1: you now need two switches or our friend Other Scott his Kid started the game first and then he made the second account like not knowing this problem and the child is not Particularly engaged in driving anything forward.

756
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:38,228
Speaker 1: So the island you just log in as the child And yeah, but now you gotta play games like that.

757
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:39,853
Speaker 0: I feel like the problem.

758
00:56:40,837 --> 00:56:41,720
Speaker 0: I don't see a problem with that.

759
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,591
Speaker 0: Just log in as the child and do the thing.

760
00:56:43,611 --> 00:56:47,024
Speaker 0: Yeah, the kid child might notice What are they gonna notice?

761
00:56:47,064 --> 00:56:49,192
Speaker 0: that there's now a new building on the island right?

762
00:56:49,875 --> 00:56:50,979
Speaker 0: You just tell them you did it.

763
00:56:53,023 --> 00:56:55,360
Speaker 1: I just feel like this was a weird omission like it.

764
00:56:56,042 --> 00:57:00,115
Speaker 1: I can't believe Nintendo didn't anticipate this being a big problem for people.

765
00:57:00,136 --> 00:57:02,199
Speaker 0: Nintendo definitely You know.

766
00:57:02,241 --> 00:57:06,027
Speaker 0: It's like I said There's so much missed Potential like the way the online works.

767
00:57:06,087 --> 00:57:08,113
Speaker 0: only eight people on an island at a time.

768
00:57:08,153 --> 00:57:10,300
Speaker 0: the island can only be so big.

769
00:57:10,902 --> 00:57:16,520
Speaker 0: The egg thing is man, right and the when you join someone else's island, right?

770
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,148
Speaker 0: it's like there's this huge cutscene.

771
00:57:18,188 --> 00:57:23,149
Speaker 0: that cutscene is so fucking long and There's a lot of connection issues.

772
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:29,660
Speaker 0: and think it's because Nintendo I think was Expecting this to be like children playing the game together like someone joining the island.

773
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:38,508
Speaker 0: They would come and stay and play a while Yeah and you wouldn't have people coming in and out and in and out and in and out and in and out just to sell their Turnips and leave like with a chain of right.

774
00:57:38,528 --> 00:57:41,817
Speaker 0: We're definitely not playing the game as intended, right?

775
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:44,424
Speaker 0: Yeah Don't.

776
00:57:44,484 --> 00:57:49,740
Speaker 0: brains can understand You know the systems and exploit them because they're not meant for adult.

777
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:52,890
Speaker 1: Yeah And exploiting the systems is part of the fun for adults to like.

778
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:53,071
Speaker 1: it's.

779
00:57:53,472 --> 00:57:58,228
Speaker 1: it's kind of fun to sell all your turnips for 600 bells apiece and make a fortune.

780
00:57:58,248 --> 00:57:59,071
Speaker 1: Yeah.

781
00:57:59,091 --> 00:58:02,343
Speaker 0: Well, I have the fortune now and now I don't need to play the stupid turnip game Ever anymore.

782
00:58:02,363 --> 00:58:03,387
Speaker 0: That's mostly why I did it.

783
00:58:03,407 --> 00:58:05,035
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I just want to have enough money.

784
00:58:05,055 --> 00:58:06,200
Speaker 0: I can stop grinding.

785
00:58:07,162 --> 00:58:08,732
Speaker 1: Yep, I'm just gonna keep doing what I'm doing.

786
00:58:08,752 --> 00:58:13,240
Speaker 1: I feel like for the long haul I'll just like poke at this game every day a little bit and like laying in bed.

787
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:16,299
Speaker 1: I might just log out and just see what's doing and just sort of mooch around.

788
00:58:17,165 --> 00:58:25,938
Speaker 0: Yeah, and one thing that's nice about it I got to say is that for you know as much of a cookie-clicker idle, you know grindy game.

789
00:58:25,978 --> 00:58:26,299
Speaker 0: it is.

790
00:58:27,302 --> 00:58:29,989
Speaker 0: One thing they did that I wish other grindy games would do.

791
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:33,760
Speaker 0: is they sort of mostly put caps on grinding ability.

792
00:58:34,021 --> 00:58:35,386
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can.

793
00:58:35,607 --> 00:58:39,280
Speaker 0: on your island you hit all your rocks up to eight times each a day.

794
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,568
Speaker 0: Maybe you accidentally have so many rocks.

795
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:43,636
Speaker 0: You can only you pick all your fruit.

796
00:58:43,756 --> 00:58:44,780
Speaker 0: Okay, I picked all my fruit.

797
00:58:45,325 --> 00:58:46,780
Speaker 0: You can go around catching bugs.

798
00:58:47,202 --> 00:58:48,972
Speaker 0: Eventually, you've caught every bug right?

799
00:58:49,052 --> 00:58:50,440
Speaker 0: It's like you can go keep fishing.

800
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:53,915
Speaker 0: It's like you can keep doing those things there as long as you want.

801
00:58:53,955 --> 00:58:55,020
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll go to other islands.

802
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:56,433
Speaker 1: Well, I only got so many nook miles.

803
00:58:56,513 --> 00:58:57,260
Speaker 1: I can only get some right.

804
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:01,160
Speaker 0: You can't use your nook miles to get tickets to go to other islands to get more stuff.

805
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,051
Speaker 0: But eventually it's like you're sort of gated.

806
00:59:04,132 --> 00:59:04,714
Speaker 0: It's like okay.

807
00:59:04,754 --> 00:59:06,180
Speaker 0: I've crafted everything I've got.

808
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:14,503
Speaker 0: It's like this can't go that far right and because of the real-time clock unless you cheat and move your clock forward It's like okay.

809
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:16,651
Speaker 0: I've done everything I can do today.

810
00:59:16,731 --> 00:59:18,016
Speaker 0: I can't play anymore today.

811
00:59:18,136 --> 00:59:19,060
Speaker 0: put the game down.

812
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:25,457
Speaker 0: It doesn't keep you locked in grinding like a MMO does like you've done basically what you can do for today.

813
00:59:25,558 --> 00:59:29,339
Speaker 0: if you keep grinding You're you won't really make that much progress.

814
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,800
Speaker 1: Yep, and also real time and it just makes it a nice sort of conference with for the real world.

815
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:37,173
Speaker 1: Like if I log in at night, it's night the first day.

816
00:59:37,233 --> 00:59:37,796
Speaker 1: I played the game.

817
00:59:37,836 --> 00:59:38,920
Speaker 1: It was pouring rain outside.

818
00:59:39,101 --> 00:59:41,151
Speaker 1: So I turned the game on pouring rain.

819
00:59:41,493 --> 00:59:42,920
Speaker 0: I don't think it checks the real weather.

820
00:59:43,765 --> 00:59:44,107
Speaker 1: It did.

821
00:59:44,187 --> 00:59:50,540
Speaker 1: seems it's definitely I'm seeing for now I haven't seen it rain in my game except when it's been rainy in the New York area.

822
00:59:51,022 --> 00:59:58,460
Speaker 0: I'll have to check and see if it actually uses GPS and some weather day Under the impression the weather was random, but I could be wrong about that.

823
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:04,064
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's happened to be since I bought the game if it's been rainy in this area It's been rainy in the game.

824
01:00:04,164 --> 01:00:06,575
Speaker 1: And when it's been sunny out, it's been not rainy in the game.

825
01:00:07,198 --> 01:00:07,740
Speaker 0: It's interesting.

826
01:00:08,783 --> 01:00:11,647
Speaker 0: Might just be a weird coincidence I think it might be.

827
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:20,340
Speaker 1: but the day-night cycle to like get I get up in the morning my villagers are up to different stuff and Like blathers is like falling asleep because he's an owl and he wants to sleep.

828
01:00:21,301 --> 01:00:29,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, and like I go at night really a lot of villages like wandered around a lot at night But the other one's always asleep at night and there's like I like watching my villagers just do stuff.

829
01:00:30,263 --> 01:00:36,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean regardless of my not caring about villagers just the aesthetic of the game I think is a large part of the appeal.

830
01:00:36,525 --> 01:00:40,298
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah You said you want to make stuff look a certain way and you wanna.

831
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:42,949
Speaker 0: you know A lot of cute things and a lot of dialogue.

832
01:00:42,969 --> 01:00:45,920
Speaker 1: I spent a lot of time thinking about how to decorate the outside of my house.

833
01:00:46,741 --> 01:00:51,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, that kind of thing right the decoration aspect right is is a large part of it.

834
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:54,430
Speaker 0: That doesn't require that much grinding actually the game.

835
01:00:54,450 --> 01:01:06,040
Speaker 0: if like you just want to decorate or dress up The game gives you plenty of clothes and furniture without much effort Yep, and also it doesn't fall into the trap Nintendo is repeatedly fallen into in the past.

836
01:01:06,321 --> 01:01:12,760
Speaker 1: It does not tie guy and girl like hairstyles to guy and girl selections, right?

837
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:19,380
Speaker 0: You have to choose sort of like, you know, one of the two character model shapes at the start, but they're just two blobs.

838
01:01:20,388 --> 01:01:21,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's mostly two blobs.

839
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:23,508
Speaker 0: I think it's more like what they start with.

840
01:01:23,588 --> 01:01:33,724
Speaker 0: clothing and hair wise is different by default But then you can customize them quite a bit terms of eyes and hair and stuff and then once you're in the game You can do whatever.

841
01:01:33,825 --> 01:01:37,737
Speaker 0: I could wear a skirt and get long hair and do whatever.

842
01:01:37,757 --> 01:01:40,483
Speaker 0: Yeah, so You do you can do you.

843
01:01:40,824 --> 01:01:46,480
Speaker 1: so the other thing apparently the game the other flaw the save data does not sync to the Nintendo online.

844
01:01:47,541 --> 01:01:49,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if your switch gets destroyed, you're just fucked.

845
01:01:49,930 --> 01:01:50,692
Speaker 1: It's all gone forever.

846
01:01:50,753 --> 01:01:51,134
Speaker 1: Fuck you.

847
01:01:51,857 --> 01:01:52,258
Speaker 0: That's true.

848
01:01:52,439 --> 01:02:04,980
Speaker 1: That is I feel like that is an even more glaring omission because Nintendo cannot be under the misapprehension That people will not care that much if they lose the 10 year long Animal Crossing game.

849
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:07,192
Speaker 1: They've poured into their ancient dying switch.

850
01:02:07,936 --> 01:02:08,177
Speaker 0: Yep.

851
01:02:08,499 --> 01:02:15,440
Speaker 0: Yep Oh the one last thing that genius thing that they added is the custom Build the custom artwork thing.

852
01:02:15,646 --> 01:02:24,551
Speaker 0: Yeah so you can make custom artwork on squares which can be used for various things like hanging up on the wall or Simple clothing and stuff like that.

853
01:02:24,611 --> 01:02:26,451
Speaker 0: Just you do pixel art in the game Yep.

854
01:02:27,461 --> 01:02:32,740
Speaker 0: And then you can just advanced pixel art you can do in the game pro designs for specific articles of clothing.

855
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:38,760
Speaker 0: It's like I want to make a hat I want to make a hoodie and you can do pixel art on these templates to make custom clothing.

856
01:02:38,841 --> 01:02:41,840
Speaker 0: So I made like a boo hoodie, which has boo the ghost on it, right?

857
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:50,080
Speaker 0: And as long as no one like reports you because you right well And then you can share your things online with other people, right?

858
01:02:50,181 --> 01:02:52,700
Speaker 0: You can use them in the game this QR code system.

859
01:02:52,780 --> 01:03:00,102
Speaker 0: There's all kinds of systems for sharing all these custom clothing designs and that requires absolutely no grinding whatsoever Like you.

860
01:03:00,122 --> 01:03:04,819
Speaker 0: just have that so you could start the game up and do very little grinding and as soon as you.

861
01:03:04,879 --> 01:03:08,313
Speaker 0: I guess I don't know if it's immediately unlocked, but it's very early unlocked.

862
01:03:08,794 --> 01:03:13,099
Speaker 0: the custom designer I think I think you know it's like a hole and it didn't take much.

863
01:03:13,822 --> 01:03:16,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, like that's a whole game in and of itself.

864
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:19,280
Speaker 0: Just making clothing a lot like Second Life did right?

865
01:03:20,824 --> 01:03:26,230
Speaker 0: And I'm seeing like every single internet community I'm a part of whether it's a nerdy one or not.

866
01:03:26,651 --> 01:03:31,486
Speaker 0: Like I seen every single sports community I'm in New York Rangers Animal Crossing.

867
01:03:31,526 --> 01:03:37,223
Speaker 0: people are in the New York Rangers community being like I made hats I made jerseys I made whatever.

868
01:03:37,805 --> 01:03:49,351
Speaker 1: right, you know, it's like literally every fan every other fandom the creativity Into it, you know this overlaps with Diorama making - you're basically making a diorama to show to people.

869
01:03:49,712 --> 01:04:03,349
Speaker 0: I see so many tweets that are just an extremely Intricately well-crafted scene in Animal Crossing and the same literally every other community has people posting custom Animal Crossing Clothing for whatever that community is.

870
01:04:03,490 --> 01:04:03,710
Speaker 1: Yep.

871
01:04:04,052 --> 01:04:04,212
Speaker 0: Right.

872
01:04:04,493 --> 01:04:06,400
Speaker 0: Look I made a stormtrooper in Animal Crossing.

873
01:04:06,601 --> 01:04:08,948
Speaker 0: Look, I made a right literally everything.

874
01:04:09,209 --> 01:04:12,640
Speaker 1: So I love how many people made prisons to lock that rabbit away.

875
01:04:13,668 --> 01:04:15,704
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Didn't have anything.

876
01:04:15,865 --> 01:04:18,880
Speaker 1: I just wasn't gonna make a bunch of fences cuz I didn't have enough wood handy.

877
01:04:18,961 --> 01:04:20,838
Speaker 1: So I just dug a pit around him and left him there.

878
01:04:21,562 --> 01:04:26,807
Speaker 0: So I say if you got a Nintendo switch and you're looking for you know It's like my Nintendo switch.

879
01:04:26,848 --> 01:04:33,917
Speaker 0: experience up until now was always You know play a game beat it and then not go back to the switch until there was a new game.

880
01:04:33,937 --> 01:04:34,439
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

881
01:04:35,541 --> 01:04:36,585
Speaker 0: And Pokemon games?

882
01:04:36,605 --> 01:04:38,432
Speaker 0: I you know, I always ever sit.

883
01:04:38,472 --> 01:04:50,280
Speaker 0: the only Pokemon games I beat were the first two maybe Two or three and then after that I played every Pokemon game, but I would only get so many gyms.

884
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:53,398
Speaker 1: I think I actually hear Animal Crossing happening in the other room right now.

885
01:04:53,861 --> 01:04:57,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, every other Pokemon game I would play some number of gyms and then stop right?

886
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:58,541
Speaker 0: Whereas?

887
01:04:58,682 --> 01:05:01,999
Speaker 0: and that Pokemon could be your go-to game to fall back on?

888
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:07,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, but I think for most people the Animal Crossing is actually the alright.

889
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,524
Speaker 0: You got your switch.

890
01:05:08,544 --> 01:05:19,600
Speaker 0: games come out you play them Mario Odyssey comes out Zelda comes out you play them and you beat them But instead of putting your switch away you fall back to the Animal Crossing as the thing for your switch does.

891
01:05:19,821 --> 01:05:21,573
Speaker 0: Yeah, and now you're using it all the time, right?

892
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:29,380
Speaker 1: Someone even updated the Wikipedia to say the game's success has been partially attributed to its release during the coronavirus pandemic.

893
01:05:29,863 --> 01:05:30,044
Speaker 0: It is.

894
01:05:30,205 --> 01:05:31,051
Speaker 0: it's absolutely true.

895
01:05:31,071 --> 01:05:34,365
Speaker 0: players seeking a sense of exaggeration Yeah, or joke in any way.

896
01:05:34,405 --> 01:05:44,997
Speaker 0: it even says it right here with players seeking a sense of normality amidst worldwide shelter-in-place orders Seeking normality, but I absolutely would not have bought it if I was not stuck inside with this much free time.

897
01:05:45,178 --> 01:05:45,339
Speaker 1: Yep.

898
01:05:46,441 --> 01:05:47,687
Speaker 1: So yeah animal cry.

899
01:05:47,707 --> 01:05:53,711
Speaker 1: if you want to mooch around on an island make a diorama Talk to some animals and catch some fish like this.

900
01:05:53,751 --> 01:05:56,060
Speaker 0: game's pretty fun and you know, it's way better.

901
01:05:56,281 --> 01:06:00,300
Speaker 0: It's way better if you have friends who are into it so that you can do stuff together.

902
01:06:00,441 --> 01:06:03,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, or and also like there's there's a level of effort.

903
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:10,700
Speaker 1: I'm not willing to put into a game like this, but I can Experience that level of effort via some of our more hardcore friends, right?

904
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:14,620
Speaker 0: It's like the other people I think are like gonna play that stock market weekly, right?
