00:00:55,245 --> 00:00:57,619
Speaker 0: I guess you curate your Twitter feed like I do.

18
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:04,409
Speaker 1: I'm just well just saying like in my circle of people not just on the internet just in general like I've voted every time since I was 18.

19
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:07,020
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure you voted almost every time.

20
00:01:07,961 --> 00:01:10,354
Speaker 1: Did you send some absentee ballots back to Michigan?

21
00:01:10,374 --> 00:01:19,308
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I sent some back to Connecticut when there was a couple of midterms or all actually some off years where I didn't vote because I Was traveling overseas and I didn't set up the absentee in time.

22
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,677
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, they weren't in beacon.

23
00:01:21,717 --> 00:01:27,478
Speaker 1: We went to the VA Hospital the the veteran center, whatever it's called.

24
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,228
Speaker 1: They still had the good machines.

25
00:01:31,448 --> 00:01:34,760
Speaker 0: they moved our lever polling place to a different place.

26
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:35,766
Speaker 1: Yours got moved.

27
00:01:35,787 --> 00:01:39,975
Speaker 0: it got moved last year and mine It's way further away and there's no subway.

28
00:01:40,015 --> 00:01:44,259
Speaker 1: that takes you though Mine is so has been the same for nine years since I lived here.

29
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:50,544
Speaker 1: Yeah, right and not only is it the same place the same two people at the desk the same two ladies at the desk Same deal.

30
00:01:50,785 --> 00:01:54,859
Speaker 1: I don't remember the number because I know where they are even though I do know the numbers right?

31
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:05,266
Speaker 1: The thing is for for the first time ever even more than any past election Even presidential elections There was a line today.

32
00:02:05,307 --> 00:02:08,221
Speaker 1: at this morning before I went to work the line today I went.

33
00:02:08,241 --> 00:02:12,838
Speaker 1: there was a line because there were five scanning machines and two of them were not working.

34
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:15,900
Speaker 0: Oh So I saw more people in law.

35
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:17,260
Speaker 1: So it was two pages.

36
00:02:17,682 --> 00:02:21,618
Speaker 1: So you got to put you got to tear it apart and you got to put in one page and then put in the other page.

37
00:02:23,022 --> 00:02:26,620
Speaker 1: Order, it doesn't matter what orientation but you got to put anyone and then put in.

38
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,279
Speaker 0: I watched a lot of people having a lot of trouble understanding the fact that there were two pages to deal.

39
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,219
Speaker 1: well Because those people haven't, you know, I voted in the same place the same way nine times.

40
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,548
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I'm a person who can whoosh.

41
00:02:38,649 --> 00:02:43,110
Speaker 1: I wish at the MTA to buy a metro card I wish at the grocery store.

42
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,702
Speaker 1: I wish to get past the TSA Right.

43
00:02:45,923 --> 00:02:47,812
Speaker 1: I'm a person who can whoosh through things.

44
00:02:48,193 --> 00:02:49,640
Speaker 1: people who can't whoosh through things.

45
00:02:49,781 --> 00:02:53,040
Speaker 1: They got problems for something that for I don't know why they don't do it every year.

46
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,185
Speaker 1: They should be used to it by now.

47
00:02:54,365 --> 00:03:00,335
Speaker 0: So even though I like read those propositions We were voting on like a million times thought about him a lot.

48
00:03:00,355 --> 00:03:03,810
Speaker 1: I read him again I went with I went yes.

49
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,011
Speaker 0: Yes.

50
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:05,717
Speaker 1: Yes, and I almost went yes.

51
00:03:05,797 --> 00:03:10,254
Speaker 1: No, yes Yeah, I was thinking that too because I didn't see any compelling.

52
00:03:10,354 --> 00:03:11,899
Speaker 1: there were a lot of people arguing for yes.

53
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,090
Speaker 1: No No, there were some right-wing people arguing for no, no.

54
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,260
Speaker 1: No, yeah, mostly people who had a hard-on for hating the mayor.

55
00:03:19,101 --> 00:03:19,422
Speaker 1: That's it.

56
00:03:19,482 --> 00:03:24,637
Speaker 0: the only complaint I could find about two was that it gives the mayor's office too much power.

57
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:31,540
Speaker 0: it does but The risk of there being a Republican mayor in New York City in the modern era pretty low.

58
00:03:31,922 --> 00:03:36,827
Speaker 0: And if anything, I think the next mayor is gonna be left of de Blasio Because it's the city voting.

59
00:03:36,847 --> 00:03:37,892
Speaker 0: I don't have to worry about upstate.

60
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:41,243
Speaker 1: Yeah, but yeah, so I just want the SES.

61
00:03:41,283 --> 00:03:41,504
Speaker 1: Yes.

62
00:03:41,784 --> 00:03:42,587
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's fine.

63
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:46,878
Speaker 0: So I hope you voted and I hope you're listening to this.

64
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:47,259
Speaker 0: cuz I'm.

65
00:03:48,481 --> 00:03:50,347
Speaker 0: It's not in the bag, but I'm hopeful.

66
00:03:50,407 --> 00:03:51,270
Speaker 0: That's all I'm gonna say.

67
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,000
Speaker 0: Okay, you're probably here to escape from all that.

68
00:03:54,302 --> 00:03:55,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what I'm.

69
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,979
Speaker 1: that's what I got to say.

70
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,335
Speaker 1: Right is that there's too many people who like sit around all night constantly watching.

71
00:04:01,355 --> 00:04:02,579
Speaker 0: I'm gonna do that as it.

72
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:04,632
Speaker 1: yeah That's you know, that's fucking stupid.

73
00:04:04,692 --> 00:04:07,546
Speaker 1: right when I'm playing a board But I'm playing a board game.

74
00:04:08,028 --> 00:04:13,020
Speaker 1: if I take my turn and I can't do anything till it's my turn again I just get up from the table.

75
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,573
Speaker 1: I don't got to pay attention to what the fuck's going on until it's my.

76
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:18,329
Speaker 1: until I can do something again You can't do nothing right?

77
00:04:18,409 --> 00:04:20,140
Speaker 1: Well, do I need to sit there while the score is counted?

78
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,980
Speaker 1: No, I'll just come back and find out after everyone else finished counting the score.

79
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:23,743
Speaker 1: It's tough though.

80
00:04:23,803 --> 00:04:27,420
Speaker 1: And this is a board game where I don't get another turn until next fucking year.

81
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,026
Speaker 1: So I don't got to do nothing.

82
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:30,834
Speaker 1: Why should I pay attention all night for no reason?

83
00:04:30,874 --> 00:04:32,260
Speaker 1: I'm gonna watch ice hockey.

84
00:04:32,642 --> 00:04:34,449
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a good ice hockey.

85
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:35,915
Speaker 1: I'm gonna play some video games.

86
00:04:36,177 --> 00:04:36,819
Speaker 1: I'm gonna read a book.

87
00:04:37,304 --> 00:04:38,600
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna watch a little ice hockey.

88
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:46,440
Speaker 0: But I got a better plan to avoid cuz I am compelled because I have this weird duality where there's the rational like.

89
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:49,913
Speaker 0: I have put the input into the system that I can and there's nothing I can do.

90
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:51,218
Speaker 0: and then there's the.

91
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:56,613
Speaker 0: I Appreciate this as a spectacle and enjoy watching it burn.

92
00:04:56,674 --> 00:05:00,471
Speaker 1: You know what a better spectacle is hockey 39 saves baby.

Speaker 0: Are you sure?

135
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,569
Speaker 1: If you don't own it then you lost it.

136
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:40,457
Speaker 1: or someone stole it or you sold it someone who.

137
00:06:40,477 --> 00:06:41,020
Speaker 0: I just stolen it.

138
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,108
Speaker 1: It was a copy in the house in Beacon.

139
00:06:43,128 --> 00:06:43,851
Speaker 1: We played it once.

140
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:44,955
Speaker 1: it belonged to not me.

141
00:06:45,316 --> 00:06:45,577
Speaker 0: Yep.

142
00:06:45,758 --> 00:06:46,320
Speaker 1: I didn't buy it.

143
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,148
Speaker 0: I only remember playing it with Luke.

144
00:06:48,168 --> 00:06:50,700
Speaker 0: Are you sure Alex didn't own it and he just left it in our house?

145
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:51,764
Speaker 1: That's possible.

146
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:55,600
Speaker 0: I think Alex owned it because the other game Alex owns that we cannot get is Vinci.

147
00:06:55,921 --> 00:06:56,785
Speaker 1: I mean, that's possible.

148
00:06:56,866 --> 00:06:57,469
Speaker 1: But what?

149
00:06:57,489 --> 00:06:59,860
Speaker 0: how much money I'd have to give Alex to get his Vinci from him?

150
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,845
Speaker 1: I'm sure he's not using it.

151
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:02,976
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I don't know if you'd want to part with it.

152
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:03,720
Speaker 1: I wouldn't either.

153
00:07:03,941 --> 00:07:10,002
Speaker 0: So the other thing that I did when we're getting into the news is as you know Overwatch Competitive.

154
00:07:10,203 --> 00:07:12,713
Speaker 1: well, well, it was it was it was Blizzcon.

155
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,399
Speaker 1: Oh, there's a lot of Blizzard.

156
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:18,672
Speaker 0: No Yeah, the the the overwatch competitive scene like the professional scene.

157
00:07:19,234 --> 00:07:21,260
Speaker 0: There are some a-plus games going down.

158
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:26,700
Speaker 1: Also, there is a new Starcraft 2 champion who is not from Korea.

159
00:07:26,841 --> 00:07:31,099
Speaker 1: The first time ever a non-korean made it to the finals and the first time ever a non-korean won.

160
00:07:31,901 --> 00:07:34,414
Speaker 1: Congratulations, I forget your name and I don't have it on my screen.

161
00:07:34,998 --> 00:07:49,419
Speaker 0: So I Tried something I decided at the end of the previous competitive season to do something I've never done and because when I play overwatch, it's always like super chill people because I'm usually playing with like Gold's Maybe some Platinum's maybe upper Silver's at most.

162
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:55,940
Speaker 0: So, uh, I joined the random solo queue by myself to do ten placement matches.

163
00:07:56,141 --> 00:08:02,425
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah, holy fuck are the worst people on earth Doing that?

164
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:06,320
Speaker 0: I got put with teams with the things that I noticed the most are number one.

165
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:14,333
Speaker 0: There is always always always 100% of the time a group of two That is together in the game with a bunch of randos who never joined the voice chat.

166
00:08:14,373 --> 00:08:23,983
Speaker 0: never communicate and lose the game for you okay, and to Every single person who was salty in the voice chat was French Canadian Mm-hmm.

167
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:27,340
Speaker 0: I don't know if it was just an artifact of when I was playing a beer geography.

168
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,272
Speaker 0: Yeah, right every time someone was getting real butter.

169
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:33,400
Speaker 0: It sounded French Canadian.

170
00:08:35,062 --> 00:08:37,759
Speaker 0: But that was at the end of the season like three days to go.

171
00:08:38,322 --> 00:08:42,860
Speaker 0: So I made it six matches in and it was so bad that I just stopped and I even stopped livestreaming.

172
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,381
Speaker 0: I just gave up.

173
00:08:43,883 --> 00:08:49,080
Speaker 0: so I did it again at the beginning of the season and it was like night and day.

174
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:58,568
Speaker 0: I actually found some good people and I played some real games and My new plan is to just play rando competitive overwatch Rank be damned.

175
00:08:58,628 --> 00:09:01,360
Speaker 0: Let's just ride this train straight into hell, right?

176
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:11,120
Speaker 1: Well, I mean that's the Hearthstone is the same thing because the way they do the seasons and most Blizzard games Right with their ranks and ladders is they give you everyone a big reset or whatever and every month.

177
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,499
Speaker 1: So what happens at the beginning of the month?

178
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:19,800
Speaker 1: Everyone is doing the same thing and getting back into it has been d ranked or has to place match again.

179
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:25,500
Speaker 1: So because you're in with everyone you get matched really well with people who are close to your level, right?

180
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,280
Speaker 1: You know things are doing good, right?

181
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:43,299
Speaker 1: But then at the end of the month if you're still doing like placement matches or you're like You know low ranks at the end of the month Like if you play Hearthstone at the end of the month ranked and you didn't play all month because you're just not that into it I can just like get win streak like up like ding ding ding ding.

182
00:09:44,986 --> 00:09:49,528
Speaker 1: But if I play in the early part of the month It's like depending on how much I've been downranked.

183
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:53,500
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, there's people there who are about my level who also got down, right?

184
00:09:54,140 --> 00:10:02,142
Speaker 0: Everything's still about where it belongs, you know, so in some news The TLDR is Salty.

185
00:10:02,182 --> 00:10:10,211
Speaker 0: babies are mad that a company released a game that is not targeted at them Mm-hmm, and they're mad enough to have tanked Blizzard stock.

186
00:10:11,134 --> 00:10:19,900
Speaker 0: I don't know how the stock market so stupid And What all I want to say is nothing I am about to say is investment advice.

187
00:10:20,302 --> 00:10:22,391
Speaker 0: I am NOT giving you investment advice.

188
00:10:22,752 --> 00:10:29,797
Speaker 0: I am simply talking about decisions I have made and personal opinions I have based on publicly available information.

189
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,079
Speaker 0: I Have to say that a lot on getting nice.

190
00:10:34,221 --> 00:10:35,184
Speaker 0: So here's the deal.

191
00:10:35,745 --> 00:10:37,089
Speaker 0: Blizzard has Blizzcon.

192
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:40,318
Speaker 0: Uh, I wouldn't go to Blizzcon, but this comes like.

193
00:10:40,358 --> 00:10:40,920
Speaker 0: it's not bad.

194
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,324
Speaker 0: It's not like.

195
00:10:41,344 --> 00:10:44,787
Speaker 0: I guess I mean Where they fuck it up.

196
00:10:44,947 --> 00:10:47,175
Speaker 1: It's better than e3 or twitchcon.

197
00:10:47,276 --> 00:10:48,500
Speaker 0: I think it's more like going.

198
00:10:48,944 --> 00:10:50,800
Speaker 1: I just don't see a real reason to go there.

199
00:10:51,101 --> 00:10:52,468
Speaker 1: We were discussing this on the forum.

200
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:53,312
Speaker 1: right is the most of?

201
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:54,800
Speaker 1: Blizzcon is an advertisement.

202
00:10:55,241 --> 00:10:59,113
Speaker 1: So why would you pay and travel to attend an advertisement?

203
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:03,238
Speaker 0: No, I would say based on the content edit It's more like going to AGD queue.

204
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,509
Speaker 1: AGD queue isn't really the greatest thing to attend either.

205
00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:08,136
Speaker 1: but at least it's not an advertisement.

206
00:11:08,176 --> 00:11:10,544
Speaker 1: and if it is an advertisement It's an advertisement for charity.

207
00:11:10,564 --> 00:11:21,240
Speaker 1: A big part of cons like that like both of those is The drinking and hanging out outside of the con which is you can do that without buying a badge.

208
00:11:21,441 --> 00:11:22,183
Speaker 1: I'm not I'm not.

209
00:11:22,284 --> 00:11:25,014
Speaker 1: I'm not judging anyone for attending a gathering.

210
00:11:25,315 --> 00:11:27,558
Speaker 1: attending a gathering is great No matter where it is.

211
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:29,648
Speaker 1: I'm saying why buy the badge?

212
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:41,400
Speaker 1: right if Pax did not have anything valuable on the inside of it And I still wanted to attend to gather I would honestly just go to Paxes that are nearby and not go into the Pax and not buy a badge.

213
00:11:41,623 --> 00:11:48,480
Speaker 1: In fact, I hate to say this I'm only judging the buying a badge and going inside value not be going to hang out with people value.

214
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:55,990
Speaker 0: But anyway, like Blizzcon is fine because it's at least it's run well Unlike twitchcon like it doesn't fail in basic ways,

215
00:11:56,371 --> 00:11:56,591
Speaker 1: but

216
00:11:57,113 --> 00:12:02,428
Speaker 0: at Blizzcon they announced that there's going to be a Diablo Mobile game an MMO for phones

217
00:12:02,669 --> 00:12:12,538
Speaker 1: and I was like, oh I can clear that's actually you know It's like Diablo is a game where you mindlessly click on monsters and get loot and then you do it again and again and again And get better loot and more stats.

218
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,194
Speaker 0: and Was that is just Diablo, right?

219
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:17,100
Speaker 1: That's what Diablo is.

220
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,952
Speaker 1: So I'm like, you know what that kind of game.

221
00:12:18,992 --> 00:12:27,718
Speaker 1: if you're sitting at your PC You really want to play a mindless game like that and very rarely maybe once every couple years I'll spend like a day playing a stupid game like that.

222
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:32,420
Speaker 1: Yeah In fact, I just played like a $1 do-nothing steam game for like it for like a few hours.

223
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,466
Speaker 0: But it's like you put that.

224
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:38,336
Speaker 1: if you put that garbage on my phone it's like.

225
00:12:38,376 --> 00:12:41,028
Speaker 1: well if I'm on the subway Yeah, a garbage game is perfect.

226
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:43,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, especially if I can play it on the toilet.

227
00:12:43,861 --> 00:12:44,263
Speaker 1: That's like.

228
00:12:44,324 --> 00:12:45,773
Speaker 1: and I was like when I saw this news.

229
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:46,880
Speaker 1: I was like, oh, you know what?

230
00:12:47,461 --> 00:12:49,995
Speaker 1: I don't really want to play Diablo on my computer that often.

231
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:50,900
Speaker 1: I played Diablo 3.

232
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,420
Speaker 1: It took me like a couple days to beat and then I didn't play it again.

233
00:12:53,621 --> 00:12:56,150
Speaker 0: So I saw this news and I ignored my phone.

234
00:12:56,211 --> 00:12:57,937
Speaker 1: I'm like him maybe I thought like.

235
00:12:57,978 --> 00:12:59,646
Speaker 0: I thought okay That's probably good for Blizzard.

236
00:12:59,747 --> 00:13:00,773
Speaker 0: I had a bunch of Blizzard stock.

237
00:13:00,873 --> 00:13:02,020
Speaker 0: I can see why they're doing this.

238
00:13:02,302 --> 00:13:03,572
Speaker 0: I'll probably poke at it.

239
00:13:03,673 --> 00:13:04,500
Speaker 0: I doubt it'll be good.

240
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:08,439
Speaker 0: I looked at who they're sort of outsourcing it to probably not gonna be a good game.

241
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:12,653
Speaker 1: Yeah, no That's the thing is that when I first saw the news making it is basically a shovel.

242
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:16,680
Speaker 1: when I first saw the news I thought it was Blizzard making the game themselves.

243
00:13:16,841 --> 00:13:17,946
Speaker 1: But no they gave that.

244
00:13:17,966 --> 00:13:23,900
Speaker 1: they licensed the IP of Diablo to a company that made Garbage-o games and it's a garbage-o game.

245
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,179
Speaker 1: And in fact people are pointing at an existing game.

246
00:13:26,521 --> 00:13:30,940
Speaker 1: Because if it's like they're not the first person to ever think to put a Diablo action RPG on a phone.

247
00:13:31,522 --> 00:13:43,863
Speaker 1: They pointed at an existing game that doesn't have Diablo IP obviously But it's basically looks 90% like what they showed from the Diablo and that game isn't a game I'm gonna play.

248
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:50,851
Speaker 0: so whatever that canceled my Diablo phone plan, so it's not for me I don't care, and it'll probably make money.

249
00:13:50,891 --> 00:13:52,720
Speaker 0: and that's basically all I thought about it.

250
00:13:53,121 --> 00:14:00,184
Speaker 0: And then a little while later I get a stock alert because Blizzard stock dropped like 7% on this news, okay I don't know who.

251
00:14:00,244 --> 00:14:11,886
Speaker 1: the people who so that means people know I have access to People who owned Blizzard stock chose to sell it so much that it went down 7% which is a huge percentage.

252
00:14:12,006 --> 00:14:14,073
Speaker 1: so in a day so full disclosure.

253
00:14:14,093 --> 00:14:16,060
Speaker 0: I own a lot of Blizzard stock.

254
00:14:16,401 --> 00:14:18,892
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay, like I like I've it's one of my.

255
00:14:18,932 --> 00:14:20,600
Speaker 0: it's a big part of my portfolio.

256
00:14:21,302 --> 00:14:26,380
Speaker 1: So I immediately wonder what percentage of my index fund portfolio, so I immediately have a minor amount of pressure.

257
00:14:26,602 --> 00:14:27,813
Speaker 1: I own some indirectly.

258
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:35,000
Speaker 0: oh Did something go wrong, and I didn't in any way think that this was gonna be related to anything that happened at Blizzcon.

259
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:38,060
Speaker 0: I assume there was some like event that it like something happened.

260
00:14:38,803 --> 00:14:40,711
Speaker 0: And then I like I have access to a bloomer terminal.

261
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:41,976
Speaker 0: so I start poking around the news.

262
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:42,820
Speaker 0: nothing.

263
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:51,660
Speaker 0: There's nothing other than that trending hashtag not my Diablo and salty babies flipping out in social media.

264
00:14:52,781 --> 00:14:58,600
Speaker 0: So basically the best I can tell is like what happened is that this announcement occurred.

265
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:10,560
Speaker 0: Hedge funds and real investors who like know what they're doing looked at and said wow a game company That's good at what they're doing is taking a popular IP and going international with it because that's exactly what they're doing.

266
00:15:11,102 --> 00:15:19,912
Speaker 0: When you want to go international with a game especially if you want to go into say China Eastern Europe you basically make a shovelware MMO, and it makes shit tons of money.

267
00:15:19,932 --> 00:15:20,574
Speaker 0: That's like what you do.

268
00:15:20,594 --> 00:15:21,216
Speaker 0: That's like.

269
00:15:21,256 --> 00:15:21,978
Speaker 0: That's fine.

270
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:26,846
Speaker 0: Yep and I Guess and this is all pure speculation.

271
00:15:26,867 --> 00:15:39,380
Speaker 0: I have to like really disclaim this is that what happened is that most entities that invest in gaming Don't actually have a lot of people who really know a lot about gaming that are making these decisions?

272
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:39,902
Speaker 0: They're investing.

273
00:15:40,082 --> 00:15:41,266
Speaker 1: I'm one of my co-workers.

274
00:15:41,286 --> 00:15:45,179
Speaker 1: Who's very young and I think somewhat naive, but not the naivest right.

275
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:45,380
Speaker 1: you know.

276
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,192
Speaker 1: There's those naive investors who are like doing real stupid shit, and yeah shit.

277
00:15:49,433 --> 00:15:55,100
Speaker 1: He's a couple levels above that right yeah But he's big on investing in game companies cuz he knows a lot.

278
00:15:55,180 --> 00:16:03,317
Speaker 1: He knows as much about video games as any of us normal game And I invest in like Hasbro and Blizzard and likes the kind of companies.

279
00:16:03,357 --> 00:16:04,180
Speaker 0: I know a lot about right.

280
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:04,803
Speaker 1: You know he's.

281
00:16:05,024 --> 00:16:07,540
Speaker 1: he's buying and selling game stocks, and I guess he's making money.

282
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,359
Speaker 1: He's not poor and he's has a normal job, too.

283
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,920
Speaker 1: He's not doing it like he's not obviously not day trading because I see him sitting there coding all day.

284
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:19,449
Speaker 1: So it's made like it's obviously not a negative gambling behavior I've made like irresponsible level.

285
00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:22,940
Speaker 0: I've made over a hundred percent gains year over a year for two years in a row.

286
00:16:23,222 --> 00:16:28,532
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like if you're an expert on something And there's nobody playing the market who's also an expert on the thing.

287
00:16:28,632 --> 00:16:34,109
Speaker 1: you can make money even without insider Trading with the specific knowledges about specific companies.

288
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:37,379
Speaker 1: yeah, because I don't know any because you have general knowledge right.

289
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:39,649
Speaker 1: for example Let's say you're investing in pharmaceuticals.

290
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:41,900
Speaker 1: a lot of experts are investing in pharmaceuticals.

291
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,087
Speaker 1: It's tough to compete there.

292
00:16:43,328 --> 00:16:45,380
Speaker 1: the markets probably gonna move in the correct direction.

293
00:16:46,224 --> 00:16:51,926
Speaker 1: But if you're investing in like you know lasers How many laser experts are there?

294
00:16:51,986 --> 00:16:56,380
Speaker 1: and if you see like a paper like who someone invented some cool new tech or something and you?

295
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:01,577
Speaker 1: Know that certain company is the most positioned to move on that or whatever.

296
00:17:01,597 --> 00:17:02,300
Speaker 0: so here's an aside.

297
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,780
Speaker 0: I'm gonna tell her that's gonna ruin another company's business.

298
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:06,345
Speaker 1: They're not prepared for this new.

299
00:17:06,506 --> 00:17:12,089
Speaker 0: and you know the first time I ever made like real money in the stock market was a long long Time ago when I first bought stock.

300
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:13,257
Speaker 0: I was like I'm a buy stock.

301
00:17:13,297 --> 00:17:16,680
Speaker 0: cuz I'm smart I know what I'm doing which was probably a mistake cuz I didn't know.

302
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:24,940
Speaker 1: I won the stock market game in When I was in seventh grade, and then we went to the stock exchange.

303
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:27,487
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then they took us to McDonald's.

304
00:17:27,988 --> 00:17:31,698
Speaker 0: so basically I saw all those news stories.

305
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:46,700
Speaker 0: remember when Toyota Like a long time ago had the issue were like the accelerator was getting stuck and killing people yep And I saw that story and I saw Toyota's stock just collapse And I thought to myself That is definitely just old people messing up the pedals.

306
00:17:46,972 --> 00:17:48,385
Speaker 0: Yeah There is no way.

307
00:17:48,888 --> 00:17:51,680
Speaker 0: this problem is like is a real mechanical problem.

308
00:17:52,001 --> 00:18:01,235
Speaker 0: And I base this on the fact that just because of being someone who reads FARC There are so many stories of old people making that mistake and like it.

309
00:18:01,275 --> 00:18:02,780
Speaker 0: like that is a common problem.

310
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,189
Speaker 0: It is a shockingly common cause of accidents.

311
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:12,544
Speaker 0: is old people hit the accelerator instead of the brake yep And then they hit it harder when the car doesn't stop mm-hmm Other.

312
00:18:12,604 --> 00:18:19,167
Speaker 0: the other thing that commonly causes that is old people will like Shove the floor mat on top of the pedal.

313
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:24,568
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the other thing that happens a lot yep, so I thought there's no way There's a real problem here.

314
00:18:24,588 --> 00:18:25,253
Speaker 0: That's ridiculous.

315
00:18:25,273 --> 00:18:26,260
Speaker 0: Toyota's a smart company.

316
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,295
Speaker 1: It wouldn't fuck up that bad.

317
00:18:28,102 --> 00:18:35,454
Speaker 0: So I took literally all my savings and bought Toyota stock and I made a shit ton of money Relative to how much money I had back.

318
00:18:35,494 --> 00:18:39,500
Speaker 0: when it bounces back Yeah, cuz like a few weeks later are people not buying Toyota's now.

319
00:18:40,323 --> 00:18:43,052
Speaker 1: Then I learned that buying Toyota's just as much as any other car.

320
00:18:43,112 --> 00:18:49,080
Speaker 1: so then I learned that space and it's also that's a very popular Call me the most popular car up there with Honda.

321
00:18:49,120 --> 00:19:00,558
Speaker 0: It's basically contra investing where you believe that a stock has tanked or is otherwise undervalued Because you have domain specific knowledge not insider domain specific knowledge FARC articles.

322
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:01,140
Speaker 1: Yeah.

323
00:19:02,185 --> 00:19:09,860
Speaker 0: So in the gaming sector what I guess happened Is that most people who invest in games don't really know a lot about it.

324
00:19:10,181 --> 00:19:19,071
Speaker 0: so the algos that actually deal with these investments are primarily driven by Clever people who think that they want to base stuff on sentiment.

325
00:19:19,172 --> 00:19:19,653
Speaker 1: Yeah, they got.

326
00:19:19,694 --> 00:19:36,780
Speaker 1: there's a lot of sentiment analysis stuff That's very popular these days not just for Investing but also just for like, you know looking at social media like the bunch of tweets It'll search for something and collect a bunch of tweets and they be like, ah, we did sentiment analysis on all these tweets This search and it turned up negative.

327
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:41,420
Speaker 1: So that means the populace as a general has a negative feeling about this thing.

328
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:58,220
Speaker 0: We search for our positive feelings about this thing with the fact that like that hashtag was trending Probably in my personal opinion triggered a lot of sell-off Algos on the worry that people wanted to be ahead of the fact that this game company messed something up in gamers.

329
00:19:58,361 --> 00:19:58,805
Speaker 0: No better.

330
00:19:58,845 --> 00:19:59,833
Speaker 0: Let's trust the gamers.

331
00:20:00,337 --> 00:20:01,900
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm And that's ridiculous.

332
00:20:02,663 --> 00:20:13,979
Speaker 0: And as far as I can tell like hedge funds and people like the people who invest in games who hire Subject matter experts to advise them are probably doubling down on Activision Blizzard right now.

333
00:20:14,523 --> 00:20:16,660
Speaker 0: That's my guess and I to him doubling down.

334
00:20:17,102 --> 00:20:22,988
Speaker 0: I bought a lot of Activision Blizzard stock today because of this better Hope you write because you lose a lot of money.

335
00:20:23,149 --> 00:20:27,913
Speaker 0: Well also one I've never lost money and two I only invest for like the five-year ten-year horizon.

336
00:20:27,933 --> 00:20:28,979
Speaker 0: Like I don't ever sell stock.

337
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,628
Speaker 1: really My index funds are still killing it.

338
00:20:31,668 --> 00:20:33,132
Speaker 0: so killing it by what?

339
00:20:33,152 --> 00:20:36,608
Speaker 0: if you made a hundred percent year-over-year two years in a row I don't need a hundred percent.

340
00:20:36,628 --> 00:20:40,850
Speaker 1: I'm gonna I'm gonna have listen No, but none of us even make it a hundred percent.

341
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,140
Speaker 1: gonna have enough money to mathematically retire.

342
00:20:43,341 --> 00:20:47,040
Speaker 0: No, my retirement plan is a combination of Mad Max and communism.

343
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,574
Speaker 1: But here's the thing is that all the other people our age all the other Millennials, right?

344
00:20:51,775 --> 00:20:53,219
Speaker 1: They have nothing for retirement.

345
00:20:53,761 --> 00:20:55,672
Speaker 0: That is also terrifying.

346
00:20:55,692 --> 00:20:57,080
Speaker 1: All right, it's very terrifying.

347
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:02,680
Speaker 1: So the fact that I have any amount I figure even though it's not enough.

348
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:14,912
Speaker 1: Like if I had to retire today, obviously enough enough money, even if you add the you know, 20 whatever years of more investing It's still not enough money to retire But I'll have so much more than everyone else.

349
00:21:15,132 --> 00:21:16,537
Speaker 1: So won't I be able to get?

350
00:21:16,577 --> 00:21:17,600
Speaker 1: I'll be doing alright.

351
00:21:17,801 --> 00:21:21,495
Speaker 0: So Scott my retirement stuff is like your retirement stuff.

352
00:21:21,997 --> 00:21:22,640
Speaker 0: This is separate.

353
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,529
Speaker 0: This isn't money for when I'm seven.

354
00:21:24,589 --> 00:21:27,020
Speaker 1: not most people are not wealthy enough to have extra money.

355
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:39,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, these investments are from when I'm like uncle money bangs or D. Yeah, I am also taking a huge amount of risk by putting almost all my savings Yeah liquid cash in a relatively small number of chosen equities.

356
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:42,459
Speaker 0: That's what I keep saying, but it's never gotten me wrong so far.

357
00:21:43,722 --> 00:21:46,097
Speaker 1: But anyway, I'm doing great putting it on red.

358
00:21:46,117 --> 00:21:46,580
Speaker 1: It's been red.

359
00:21:47,485 --> 00:21:50,846
Speaker 0: I Mean, I can't go wrong.

360
00:21:51,027 --> 00:21:52,872
Speaker 0: all gills gonna eat food tonight.

361
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:54,297
Speaker 1: I'll put it on black this time.

362
00:21:54,317 --> 00:21:56,303
Speaker 1: Oh shit zero That's an option.

363
00:21:56,344 --> 00:22:00,540
Speaker 0: What what's that is green the wolves in on old gills doorstep.

364
00:22:02,163 --> 00:22:04,960
Speaker 0: But anyway, I think this is ridiculous.

365
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,984
Speaker 0: I think the people who are mad about this are being ridiculous The anyone.

366
00:22:09,285 --> 00:22:13,599
Speaker 0: and what's weird is this news made it into like basic culture.

367
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:20,834
Speaker 0: people I know in the real world who know nothing about games Heard about this and they were all mad about it for the same reason.

368
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:24,019
Speaker 0: the reason they were mad They all said the same thing they said.

369
00:22:24,421 --> 00:22:31,158
Speaker 0: But what about all the people who spent thousands of dollars to fly to Blizzcon only to get this instead of Diablo 4 like?

370
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,285
Speaker 1: That's what I was saying before.

371
00:22:34,365 --> 00:22:38,860
Speaker 1: why are you flying and paying to go to witness an advertisement in person?

372
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:41,387
Speaker 1: Get what you deserve pay and fly.

373
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:45,338
Speaker 0: that is one to watch games and get drunk with your friends and hang out.

374
00:22:45,378 --> 00:22:47,707
Speaker 0: don't fly there To get a press release.

375
00:22:48,008 --> 00:22:48,631
Speaker 1: you can get the.

376
00:22:48,731 --> 00:22:49,856
Speaker 1: I got the same press release.

377
00:22:49,896 --> 00:22:53,036
Speaker 1: it cost me nothing And also I didn't get advertised.

378
00:22:53,077 --> 00:22:53,500
Speaker 1: in the face.

379
00:22:53,781 --> 00:22:55,387
Speaker 0: I think they're Diablo.

380
00:22:55,588 --> 00:22:58,098
Speaker 0: MMO for phones is going to make a shit ton of money.

381
00:22:58,379 --> 00:23:00,249
Speaker 0: probably It's just not for you.

382
00:23:00,269 --> 00:23:02,180
Speaker 0: Diablo 4 will come out when it comes.

383
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:06,902
Speaker 1: I wonder how much money goes to the company that made it and how much goes to blizzard The other.

384
00:23:06,942 --> 00:23:17,818
Speaker 0: but basically if you're a fan of a thing that doesn't mean you get to say how said thing is made and you're Probably not the most important factor in the decisions that are being made.

385
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:24,190
Speaker 1: also If the thing you know if there's an if there's an intellectual property you like and it gets attached to something You know it's like.

386
00:23:24,292 --> 00:23:31,115
Speaker 1: I like Megaman, right This good Megaman stuff Megaman 11 just came out whatever 12.

387
00:23:31,115 --> 00:23:35,720
Speaker 1: I don't fucking know yeah But I still like Megaman yeah.

388
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:40,840
Speaker 1: And then they come up like a crappy Megaman board game and a crappy Megaman cartoon and a Megaman battle network.

389
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,368
Speaker 0: It's I don't give a shit about a network.

390
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,440
Speaker 1: I don't give a crap about any of that garbage, right?

391
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:44,964
Speaker 1: But it's like.

392
00:23:44,984 --> 00:23:46,519
Speaker 1: I don't have to stop liking Megaman.

393
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,120
Speaker 1: I don't have to be mad that they applied the Megaman IP to something else.

394
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:54,836
Speaker 1: It's like okay They applied the Diablo IP to something else that you don't give a shit about.

395
00:23:55,218 --> 00:23:55,760
Speaker 1: who cares?

396
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,769
Speaker 0: The creation of art is not a zero-sum game.

397
00:23:58,849 --> 00:24:00,374
Speaker 0: kids like it's not like.

398
00:24:00,414 --> 00:24:03,664
Speaker 1: there's a limited amount of things the Diablo IP can be applied to.

399
00:24:03,684 --> 00:24:08,297
Speaker 1: you could literally we could remake everything on earth so that everything has the Diablo IP.

400
00:24:08,377 --> 00:24:09,340
Speaker 1: every movie is Diablo.

401
00:24:10,941 --> 00:24:11,363
Speaker 1: Every.

402
00:24:11,443 --> 00:24:12,768
Speaker 1: every TV show is Diablo.

403
00:24:12,788 --> 00:24:16,745
Speaker 1: the TV show The main character is always Satan.

404
00:24:17,006 --> 00:24:19,492
Speaker 0: every time so occasionally a game will be made.

405
00:24:19,532 --> 00:24:22,620
Speaker 0: that is not for you specifically crying nerd on Twitter.

406
00:24:23,063 --> 00:24:32,180
Speaker 0: Yeah in other news riot The other big game company, and this is pretty breaking news like a little while like earlier today, right?

407
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,740
Speaker 1: So this today's today's news is like a double news from riot, right?

408
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:41,080
Speaker 1: So the news from today is that a current and former employees are suing riot for gender discrimination.

409
00:24:41,221 --> 00:24:42,928
Speaker 1: And I all I got to say is I'm not surprised.

410
00:24:43,029 --> 00:24:45,520
Speaker 1: every video game company hasn't been super gender discrimination.

411
00:24:45,581 --> 00:24:46,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not surprised.

412
00:24:46,631 --> 00:24:52,278
Speaker 0: and age-discriminated Every company is not sued for gender discrimination and age discrimination.

413
00:24:52,398 --> 00:24:53,924
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean, I've already got.

414
00:24:54,486 --> 00:24:59,996
Speaker 0: we're getting to the point like in four more years Scott and I are gonna be age-discriminated Again, it's gonna happen probably.

415
00:25:00,178 --> 00:25:02,606
Speaker 0: yeah I'm already I'm already.

416
00:25:02,827 --> 00:25:05,299
Speaker 0: it's weird how much older I am than a lot of people I work with.

417
00:25:06,584 --> 00:25:08,560
Speaker 0: But yeah, so right is straight up being sued.

418
00:25:09,505 --> 00:25:10,440
Speaker 0: You can read the article.

419
00:25:10,668 --> 00:25:18,424
Speaker 0: I mean I'm Definitely not going to give you legal advice or talk about a legal issue like this because I know a lot less about this than I do about the stock market.

420
00:25:18,444 --> 00:25:19,950
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and I don't know a lot about.

421
00:25:20,091 --> 00:25:21,677
Speaker 1: I know what the HR people tell me.

422
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:23,582
Speaker 0: Yep But

423
00:25:23,702 --> 00:25:28,476
Speaker 1: and they can't be trusted all completely because they're on they're there to defend the company not to defend

424
00:25:28,536 --> 00:25:40,920
Speaker 0: lizard like the people I know in the industry who know a lot about the inside of Blizzard like Activision Blizzard Tend to have positive things to say like crunch isn't bad Like it seems like it's a reasonably okay place to work for a big.

425
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:44,940
Speaker 1: It's not as bad as the other game companies at least in at least one or two ways.

426
00:25:45,301 --> 00:25:47,086
Speaker 0: It seems neutral to slightly positive.

427
00:25:47,126 --> 00:25:49,232
Speaker 0: is the what the impression I get from the average person?

428
00:25:49,854 --> 00:25:54,830
Speaker 0: the impression I get about riot Is pretty bad and pretty bro II.

429
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:55,974
Speaker 0: like I get the impression.

430
00:25:56,074 --> 00:26:05,260
Speaker 1: only thing I've ever gotten a good impression About riot is that they seem to actually put in an effort and try to get shitheads out of their player base.

431
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, and community, but they don't go as far as Kaplan with overwatch.

432
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:11,820
Speaker 0: who's like I will fucking ban you for quitting a game.

433
00:26:12,402 --> 00:26:13,587
Speaker 0: Let's go bring it.

434
00:26:13,607 --> 00:26:14,712
Speaker 0: What are you gonna ban?

435
00:26:14,732 --> 00:26:15,295
Speaker 0: ban for life?

436
00:26:15,335 --> 00:26:16,520
Speaker 0: Oh, you made a new account band.

437
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,605
Speaker 0: It's like that your money didn't?

438
00:26:17,645 --> 00:26:18,650
Speaker 1: we do a story on geek?

439
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,494
Speaker 1: that's a while ago.

440
00:26:19,715 --> 00:26:20,760
Speaker 1: We didn't do the story.

441
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,720
Speaker 1: We discussed the story where like that the worst possible guy was finally unbanned after a super long time.

442
00:26:26,545 --> 00:26:28,317
Speaker 1: I would never unban the worst possible guy.

443
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:31,752
Speaker 0: be like nope That's so I'm gonna run just gonna quote the article because this is everything that needs to be said.

444
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:33,720
Speaker 0: the class-action lawsuit alleges that quote.

445
00:26:34,281 --> 00:26:40,360
Speaker 0: Like many of riots games female employees plaintiffs have been denied equal pay and found their careers stifled because there are women more.

446
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:50,440
Speaker 0: So plaintiffs have also seen their working conditions negatively impacted because of the ongoing sexual harassment misconduct and bias which predominate these sexually hostile working environment of riot games.

447
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:50,962
Speaker 1: I believe it.

448
00:26:51,565 --> 00:26:54,580
Speaker 0: I have no reason to do in any way.

449
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:59,378
Speaker 1: I mean if someone said that and replaced that company name with literally any company name, I would say I believe it.

450
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:01,135
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like this.

451
00:27:02,207 --> 00:27:03,799
Speaker 1: What a company would I not believe it?

452
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,123
Speaker 0: You know what the exceptions would be?

453
00:27:05,404 --> 00:27:10,700
Speaker 0: Scott companies that are so small that I personally know literally every employee of that company.

454
00:27:11,462 --> 00:27:14,088
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe then I would be able to argue against it.

455
00:27:14,229 --> 00:27:21,232
Speaker 0: maybe but I do get the impression that riots kind of egregious compared to Even other game companies and like that.

456
00:27:21,292 --> 00:27:23,442
Speaker 0: this rumblings been around for a long time Like this is.

457
00:27:23,582 --> 00:27:25,571
Speaker 0: this is just that's a common rumbling.

458
00:27:25,892 --> 00:27:27,037
Speaker 0: and now there's this lawsuit.

459
00:27:27,298 --> 00:27:30,152
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Of course, my thing of the day is also hanging out here.

460
00:27:30,172 --> 00:27:39,147
Speaker 0: So I think it's time for Things of the day about that.

461
00:27:39,388 --> 00:27:42,920
Speaker 0: So riot if you didn't know there have been music videos.

462
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:46,959
Speaker 0: They're basically like League of Legends, but like real music video.

463
00:27:47,481 --> 00:27:54,854
Speaker 1: I mean, you know all these companies nowadays actually seem to be doing something I think is smart which is you got a video game coming out.

464
00:27:54,914 --> 00:27:55,778
Speaker 1: Maybe it's triple-a, right?

465
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,065
Speaker 1: Maybe it's not.

466
00:27:57,347 --> 00:27:58,091
Speaker 1: you want to promote it.

467
00:27:58,172 --> 00:27:59,360
Speaker 1: You can a put out a demo.

468
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:04,000
Speaker 1: Well, if you put in a demo people play it and then they don't buy a game because they got everything they needed from the demo.

469
00:28:04,522 --> 00:28:05,385
Speaker 1: You can make a trailer.

470
00:28:05,586 --> 00:28:06,489
Speaker 1: trailers are pretty good.

471
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:07,895
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of trailers.

472
00:28:07,935 --> 00:28:09,220
Speaker 1: They have some bull shots in them.

473
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:12,140
Speaker 1: So right, some of them have real game footage, right?

474
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,799
Speaker 1: But trailer trailers are okay for promoting your game.

475
00:28:15,241 --> 00:28:26,819
Speaker 1: what I see lately as I think might be the best way to promote a game or at least I like it the most is Create content with the IP That's free just on YouTube to promote the game.

476
00:28:27,061 --> 00:28:30,539
Speaker 1: For example, there were those TF 2 videos with the characters meet the so-and-so.

477
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,689
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was the watch.

478
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,900
Speaker 0: does the like little movies for every character, right?

479
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,094
Speaker 1: It seems like every Blizzard game is making like like the last hearthstone expansion.

480
00:28:39,114 --> 00:28:40,700
Speaker 1: They made like a little animated series.

481
00:28:40,823 --> 00:28:41,339
Speaker 0: Oh, who was it?

482
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,402
Speaker 0: Someone on Twitter said something.

483
00:28:42,443 --> 00:28:51,508
Speaker 0: the effect of Blizzard realized that they can weaponize how thirsty the average gamer is in the marketing of Right, it's like, you know you people are.

484
00:28:51,549 --> 00:28:53,315
Speaker 1: now I think it's anyone.

485
00:28:53,335 --> 00:29:01,359
Speaker 1: if you're making a game I think of any kind even a board game just making anything maybe anything period you want to market it create some sort of like.

486
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:11,576
Speaker 1: Not you know a commercial like you see on television but more like a Super Bowl commercial where it's like it's actual entertaining content that happens to include your IP.

487
00:29:11,596 --> 00:29:19,041
Speaker 1: that is You know something that someone would want to watch on its own and that is now a promotional item for the actual Thing.

488
00:29:19,121 --> 00:29:24,097
Speaker 1: so Katie is worlds like make transformers the cartoon to sell transformers the toy.

489
00:29:24,478 --> 00:29:33,600
Speaker 0: So Katie D they have a DB a debut single and it is this League of Legends music video and it is fucking amazing, right?

490
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,703
Speaker 1: So here's the deal, right?

491
00:29:34,763 --> 00:29:37,832
Speaker 1: So the KDA is a is a it's.

492
00:29:37,852 --> 00:29:42,967
Speaker 1: I don't know if it counts as a k-pop group or not But yeah, basically there's four members.

493
00:29:43,188 --> 00:29:50,320
Speaker 1: I don't know all their names, but two of them are from re Evelyn Kaisa and Akali, right.

494
00:29:50,381 --> 00:30:01,905
Speaker 1: so anyway two of them are from this actual kpop group called g idol and g idol is a group that came out of like was new this year and Was I became.

495
00:30:01,945 --> 00:30:03,512
Speaker 1: I thought I was like, oh another new group.

496
00:30:03,592 --> 00:30:08,099
Speaker 1: and then they were strangely incredibly popular I think because they have this one member.

497
00:30:08,822 --> 00:30:11,693
Speaker 1: So, yeah, I don't know what her name is, but she's way popular.

498
00:30:11,713 --> 00:30:13,620
Speaker 1: and then I saw her in something else and she was way good.

499
00:30:14,141 --> 00:30:21,062
Speaker 1: But anyway, so two of the people in kata are from g idol and the two other people I think from America or something I never heard of them.

500
00:30:21,703 --> 00:30:29,871
Speaker 1: and they sing the parts of these four characters who are computer generated Animated characters in this music video.

501
00:30:29,891 --> 00:30:30,856
Speaker 0: They're like little characters.

502
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:31,760
Speaker 0: You could pick and play right?

503
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:36,016
Speaker 1: There's like four Lowell characters wearing specific skins that were just released.

504
00:30:36,056 --> 00:30:37,079
Speaker 1: I guess that you could buy.

505
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:43,074
Speaker 1: And then they're dancing and singing and then the actual singers are the four people I just mentioned.

506
00:30:43,555 --> 00:30:49,935
Speaker 1: and then there are four other people Who created a dance the choreography for the music video?

507
00:30:49,996 --> 00:30:51,280
Speaker 0: You sent me the link to the practice.

508
00:30:51,841 --> 00:30:56,514
Speaker 1: So now those four people who I don't know their names their dance practice video went up today.

509
00:30:57,015 --> 00:31:01,430
Speaker 1: So they basically created for Hatsune Miku is basically for virtual.

510
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:12,712
Speaker 1: Yeah, they took four of their existing lol heroes Hatsune Miku them, but the singers are not digital singers They're actual for real people and the dancers are for other different real people.

511
00:31:13,133 --> 00:31:13,534
Speaker 0: and this.

512
00:31:13,715 --> 00:31:17,592
Speaker 0: so I saw this blow up because they've done Although there's other lol videos like this.

513
00:31:17,672 --> 00:31:18,557
Speaker 0: There's this metal like.

514
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:19,100
Speaker 0: there's a bunch of them.

515
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:24,339
Speaker 0: They're good, but I saw this blow up in my Twitter feed among like all the people I know who play lol.

516
00:31:24,945 --> 00:31:27,033
Speaker 0: So I thought okay I should watch it and it was awesome.

517
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:33,300
Speaker 0: and Then a little while later like a few days go by and it blows up among all my friends who hate lol.

518
00:31:34,045 --> 00:31:34,932
Speaker 1: And then it blew it out.

519
00:31:34,952 --> 00:31:35,335
Speaker 1: I hate lol.

520
00:31:35,355 --> 00:31:35,960
Speaker 1: I'm just indifferent.

521
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,310
Speaker 1: It's a MOBA just like all the other MOBA and then it.

522
00:31:38,371 --> 00:31:38,893
Speaker 0: well, I hate.

523
00:31:38,973 --> 00:31:39,938
Speaker 0: I hate MOBAs.

524
00:31:40,018 --> 00:31:41,967
Speaker 1: personally I'm not really big on MOBAs.

525
00:31:41,987 --> 00:31:44,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't hate them, but I'm not into them.

526
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,364
Speaker 1: I would put it this way.

527
00:31:45,384 --> 00:31:48,460
Speaker 1: The thing is I would be into them if they fixed a long list of issues.

528
00:31:48,521 --> 00:31:50,402
Speaker 1: But those issues are so egregious I can't play.

529
00:31:50,482 --> 00:31:56,943
Speaker 0: The tropes of the game genre MOBA do not suit the personal preferences of rim in Playing games.

530
00:31:57,043 --> 00:32:00,000
Speaker 1: The core of the MOBA does suit the personal preferences of Scott.

531
00:32:00,803 --> 00:32:04,780
Speaker 1: The details of every single MOBA implementation I've ever seen completely ruin it.

532
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:08,893
Speaker 0: What's worse is even like they all get something right, but then something wrong.

533
00:32:08,913 --> 00:32:09,495
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

534
00:32:09,615 --> 00:32:10,317
Speaker 0: And I there's none.

535
00:32:10,357 --> 00:32:11,543
Speaker 0: that just got all the things Right.

536
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:12,633
Speaker 1: I mean I can make one.

537
00:32:12,674 --> 00:32:13,219
Speaker 1: that's too much work.

538
00:32:13,441 --> 00:32:16,660
Speaker 0: But also I worry that if you got everything quote unquote, right?

539
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,747
Speaker 0: You're gonna make a game that's quote unquote.

540
00:32:18,787 --> 00:32:21,096
Speaker 0: good that no one wants to play because it isn't fun.

541
00:32:21,438 --> 00:32:21,940
Speaker 1: I would agree.

542
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:28,700
Speaker 0: But anyway, this video like it kept getting waves of blowing up in my social media and just watch it.

543
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,403
Speaker 0: It's great.

544
00:32:29,503 --> 00:32:32,996
Speaker 0: Like it is it is a great music video and you need to watch it.

545
00:32:33,056 --> 00:32:33,940
Speaker 1: songs on Spotify also.

546
00:32:34,261 --> 00:32:36,951
Speaker 0: Yeah, the songs stuck in my head already like permanently.

00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,549
Speaker 1: But and suddenly it's 20 bucks a day.

584
00:34:50,569 --> 00:34:51,194
Speaker 1: It's like oh fuck.

585
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:51,858
Speaker 1: That's a lot, right?

586
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,878
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's still cheaper than a lot of anime cons.

587
00:34:54,201 --> 00:35:00,761
Speaker 1: It is but still it's not cheap, but the dates look are gonna be the very end of March 2019.

588
00:35:00,761 --> 00:35:04,661
Speaker 1: Yep, so the Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday at the end of March 2019.

589
00:35:04,661 --> 00:35:06,090
Speaker 1: So be on packs East.

590
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,780
Speaker 1: so put in your vacation requests.

591
00:35:08,141 --> 00:35:09,044
Speaker 0: So it is.

592
00:35:09,104 --> 00:35:11,412
Speaker 0: it is high alert for badges and hotels.

593
00:35:11,813 --> 00:35:15,531
Speaker 1: Oh highest I'd give it a couple weeks But yeah, so, you know, it's it's high alert.

594
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:15,953
Speaker 0: It's not.

595
00:35:16,034 --> 00:35:17,040
Speaker 0: it's not critical alert.

596
00:35:17,201 --> 00:35:18,540
Speaker 1: critical alert soon.

597
00:35:18,585 --> 00:35:19,325
Speaker 1: No you can't.

598
00:35:19,365 --> 00:35:26,980
Speaker 1: I remember in past years like Going to Thanksgiving and being put at ease by a tweet and then after Thanksgiving being on critical alert.

599
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,726
Speaker 0: I feel like it might happen before Thanksgiving.

600
00:35:28,786 --> 00:35:29,147
Speaker 0: I don't know.

601
00:35:29,167 --> 00:35:35,124
Speaker 1: and if you don't know there is a Google Doc spread a Google Sheet Out there that you can.

602
00:35:35,224 --> 00:35:36,327
Speaker 1: that's publicly visible.

603
00:35:36,628 --> 00:35:45,967
Speaker 1: that has all the information on every day that every packs went on sale Sold out if it sold out How much the badges cost literally everything.

604
00:35:45,987 --> 00:35:49,556
Speaker 1: so you can plan your packs ticket purchasing whatever.

605
00:35:49,636 --> 00:35:53,279
Speaker 0: and if you really want to go deep I'm not going to link to any instance of it.

606
00:35:53,380 --> 00:36:08,940
Speaker 0: But a long time ago when the contract got signed for packs East and general Boston used to just publish like everything that's gonna happen in Boston on this like it's kind of not secret Just not well-known like bureaucracy.

607
00:36:09,081 --> 00:36:15,920
Speaker 1: Sometimes you can go to like the Convention Center website and you can see that either a Pax is listed even though it's not on the packs website.

608
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,129
Speaker 0: You'll see like read expose something something or be.

609
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:27,702
Speaker 1: the thing that happens actually even more often is the Convention Center has only booked Literally every single weekend except that one conspicuous weekend in March April ish Right around.

610
00:36:27,722 --> 00:36:30,474
Speaker 1: what packs East usually is so same for any other convention.

611
00:36:30,495 --> 00:36:35,839
Speaker 0: if you really care You can find out the dates to every PAX East through.

612
00:36:35,899 --> 00:36:38,528
Speaker 0: I think 2024 is as far as I've seen like.

613
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,193
Speaker 1: so the schedule is.

614
00:36:40,614 --> 00:36:47,765
Speaker 0: we got packs unplugged coming up first And then we got lag fest mag fest pecs out Paxis that's right.

615
00:36:47,926 --> 00:36:48,751
Speaker 1: So that's what's coming up.

616
00:36:49,535 --> 00:36:50,340
Speaker 0: So stay tuned.

617
00:36:50,704 --> 00:36:52,462
Speaker 0: We're gonna be at all of them Of course.

618
00:36:52,642 --> 00:36:56,213
Speaker 1: and the book club book is 2001 a space odyssey.

619
00:36:56,775 --> 00:37:00,895
Speaker 1: as soon as I finished the fantasy novel I'm reading right now I'm gonna read it and then we'll do an episode.

620
00:37:01,338 --> 00:37:16,388
Speaker 0: and If you need because again You're probably listening to this after the election happened if you need a social place to hang out on the internet that is guaranteed 100% Nazi free because Twitter still won't ban the Nazis Just say in the geek guides forum.

621
00:37:16,911 --> 00:37:17,252
Speaker 0: That's like.

622
00:37:17,332 --> 00:37:19,260
Speaker 0: our one rule is you can't be a nice.

623
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:27,520
Speaker 1: Yeah You go to our website front row crew calm where you can find it literally all of our content and then from there you could Got links to all of our social medias.

624
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,306
Speaker 1: You go to community dot.

625
00:37:29,346 --> 00:37:35,010
Speaker 1: front row crew calm for the currently active forum and you want to look at the old forum You can still go to forum dot front row crew calm.

626
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,840
Speaker 1: It's a little broken, but all the contents there?

627
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, there is a shit ton of content in there.

628
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:42,750
Speaker 0: Yeah This forums and going for a long time and a lot.

629
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:46,100
Speaker 0: and the scary thing is there's a number of people who post regularly.

630
00:37:46,746 --> 00:37:48,220
Speaker 0: There's a number of people who post occasionally.

631
00:37:48,722 --> 00:37:54,860
Speaker 0: There is a shocking number of people who have accounts and read this forum religiously, but never say anything.

632
00:37:55,141 --> 00:37:58,801
Speaker 0: They don't say a goddamn thing, but there's a lot of content like the forums good stuff Like.

633
00:37:58,921 --> 00:37:59,182
Speaker 0: I would.

634
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:03,780
Speaker 0: I would not tell you to go here if I didn't personally like use this on a daily basis.

635
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,683
Speaker 1: That's also ours.

636
00:38:05,345 --> 00:38:06,348
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I use it.

637
00:38:06,529 --> 00:38:09,660
Speaker 1: There are people there who are wisely not geek nights listeners.

638
00:38:10,041 --> 00:38:14,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think there's more non geek nights listeners in the geek nights forum than there are.

639
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,467
Speaker 1: They listen to a geek night.

640
00:38:15,507 --> 00:38:17,878
Speaker 1: They join the forum and they stop listening to a geek night.

641
00:38:17,918 --> 00:38:20,219
Speaker 1: Yep That is the wisest move.

642
00:38:21,862 --> 00:38:25,660
Speaker 1: That is the the the the the the most expanded brain.

643
00:38:26,202 --> 00:38:28,269
Speaker 0: Alright, so I thought I should make that.

644
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:28,671
Speaker 1: that's.

645
00:38:28,691 --> 00:38:29,132
Speaker 0: that's a good.

646
00:38:29,152 --> 00:38:30,597
Speaker 0: that's a good expanded brain.

647
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:36,380
Speaker 0: So Rollin rights are a genre of games that have existed for a long time.

648
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:42,198
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna try to even like talk about the history of them because you don't know it.

649
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:43,588
Speaker 0: No, well one I don't know it.

650
00:38:43,953 --> 00:38:49,640
Speaker 0: and two No one gave a shit about rollin rights in like the broader like tabletop community.

651
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,262
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is like a recent thing like past couple to two three years I want to say like

652
00:38:55,282 --> 00:38:56,185
Speaker 0: maybe

653
00:38:56,225 --> 00:38:57,649
Speaker 1: even more recent than the

654
00:38:57,729 --> 00:39:04,480
Speaker 0: rollin rights were like creeping in here and there and like you'd occasionally see One there were more in Japan than there were like in the US.

655
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:12,954
Speaker 1: It's a genre of tabletop games rollin right that for most of my life The only one I ever saw was Yahtzee and I didn't even realize it was a genre.

656
00:39:13,456 --> 00:39:15,525
Speaker 1: and now over the past I you know, what was that?

657
00:39:15,565 --> 00:39:17,193
Speaker 1: We played when did we play rolling America?

658
00:39:17,213 --> 00:39:18,499
Speaker 1: It was a pack last PAX East.

659
00:39:19,022 --> 00:39:20,668
Speaker 0: I think it was two packs ago.

660
00:39:20,728 --> 00:39:22,515
Speaker 1: I think it was two packs east ago.

661
00:39:22,555 --> 00:39:25,387
Speaker 1: So that's when I sort of realized Oh, not another game.

662
00:39:25,467 --> 00:39:26,512
Speaker 1: Oh this I see how it works.

663
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:28,260
Speaker 0: So I can think of one other rollin right?

664
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:31,956
Speaker 0: I played as a kid that you didn't name triple Yahtzee a different Yahtzee.

665
00:39:31,976 --> 00:39:32,257
Speaker 1: Yeah.

666
00:39:32,297 --> 00:39:34,787
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay So the Yahtzee was way bad.

667
00:39:34,807 --> 00:39:36,875
Speaker 1: Anyway, so is with the deal.

668
00:39:36,915 --> 00:39:50,468
Speaker 1: a rollin right game is Exactly what it says everyone has every player has some sort of sheet alright, or it could be a dry erase board or paper with a pencil and Some sort of dice get rolled.

669
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:52,376
Speaker 1: It could be you roll your own dice.

670
00:39:52,436 --> 00:39:53,460
Speaker 0: It could be cards or something else.

671
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:53,901
Speaker 0: it's right.

672
00:39:54,041 --> 00:40:12,136
Speaker 1: some sort of random input occurs and you have to put take that random input and put it onto your board right and Then another input is generated and you put it onto your board and you continue doing this and at the end We see who's got the best board who is optimally placed.

673
00:40:12,497 --> 00:40:15,366
Speaker 1: all these inputs Yep, right onto the board that they have.

674
00:40:15,868 --> 00:40:20,604
Speaker 0: now this seems on this if you don't think about it a lot and we both fell for this.

675
00:40:20,644 --> 00:40:31,057
Speaker 0: the first time I played a modern rollin right was when we played roll in America and the rules Were explained to us and we looked at each other and thought wow We're all just gonna do the exact same thing cuz we're all intelligent adults.

676
00:40:31,318 --> 00:40:32,607
Speaker 0: No Right.

677
00:40:32,628 --> 00:40:33,200
Speaker 1: So here's the thing.

678
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:40,679
Speaker 1: So at the first at the first baby level of rollin right is Yahtzee right and the thing with Yahtzee is there's a luck involved Because everyone's rolling their own dice.

679
00:40:41,011 --> 00:40:41,220
Speaker 1: Yeah.

680
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:47,200
Speaker 1: So if I get different it's easy to optimally place and mostly easy for top to me place in Yahtzee.

681
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:47,541
Speaker 1: We.

682
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:53,840
Speaker 0: sometimes it's a little trick Scott and I verified years ago with a website where you play Yahtzee nearly optimally.

683
00:40:53,860 --> 00:41:00,534
Speaker 1: Yeah, like we play Yahtzee This is a very very early geek nights thing of the day was was a website that will.

684
00:41:00,835 --> 00:41:07,960
Speaker 0: basically there's an optimal Yahtzee playing Computer and you play a ton of Yahtzee and then it tells you how close your play is to perfect optimal mathematical play, right?

685
00:41:08,081 --> 00:41:16,015
Speaker 1: So if you could say roll all the dice in advance on Yahtzee You could obviously place them optimally but because you have to place immediately after you roll.

686
00:41:16,035 --> 00:41:19,780
Speaker 1: It's like alright I just got four of a kind but that's also a 20.

687
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,846
Speaker 1: It's also four sixes.

688
00:41:20,866 --> 00:41:23,680
Speaker 1: do I go 24 in the sixth column or do I go like wait?

689
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,526
Speaker 1: I just thought of a game 28 in the.

690
00:41:25,907 --> 00:41:26,389
Speaker 0: so here's the.

691
00:41:26,429 --> 00:41:27,573
Speaker 0: here's the game of Yahtzee.

692
00:41:28,035 --> 00:41:34,154
Speaker 0: to make this more like a modern roll And right so someone's turn they roll the dice and they're out there.

693
00:41:34,174 --> 00:41:38,260
Speaker 0: the end result of these rolls Everyone has to put on their sheet, right?

694
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,570
Speaker 1: So that that is what modern roll and rights are.

695
00:41:40,972 --> 00:41:42,500
Speaker 0: but the problem is with Yahtzee.

696
00:41:43,241 --> 00:41:47,400
Speaker 0: The person's going to whoever rolled the dice is then gonna like optimize the dice like they're gonna.

697
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,449
Speaker 1: Oh, they're doing the rerolls in their favor.

698
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:52,040
Speaker 1: So imagine that might be not in someone else's favor.

699
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:52,364
Speaker 0: Yeah Oh.

700
00:41:52,520 --> 00:42:02,925
Speaker 0: So imagine a Yahtzee game where some of the real dice get rolled in the middle and there is some sort of mechanic For everyone to affect those dice Independently are your?

701
00:42:03,286 --> 00:42:05,155
Speaker 1: are your score sheets public or not?

702
00:42:05,275 --> 00:42:06,260
Speaker 1: That's a big difference.

703
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,147
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think the score sheets aren't public.

704
00:42:08,167 --> 00:42:08,951
Speaker 0: and then it gets real.

705
00:42:09,011 --> 00:42:11,616
Speaker 1: is then I see I see rim or discord a board of a kind.

706
00:42:12,685 --> 00:42:13,698
Speaker 1: I guess I reroll in this.

707
00:42:15,049 --> 00:42:18,630
Speaker 0: So rolling I think I think there's a game there.

708
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:19,433
Speaker 0: I gotta think about this.

709
00:42:19,714 --> 00:42:20,556
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's not about.

710
00:42:20,577 --> 00:42:21,640
Speaker 1: but anyway, so that's Yahtzee.

711
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:28,060
Speaker 1: You have this luck involved where you're trying you're solving a puzzle of optimally placing these numbers into slots to get the most points.

712
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:33,298
Speaker 1: But since your dice are not the same as everyone else's dice there's luck involved, right?

713
00:42:33,398 --> 00:42:34,422
Speaker 1: I got a Yahtzee You didn't.

714
00:42:34,642 --> 00:42:36,932
Speaker 1: yeah, the next level rolling right is what's happened.

715
00:42:36,992 --> 00:42:39,040
Speaker 1: Most of these games are these days, which is okay.

716
00:42:39,122 --> 00:42:44,988
Speaker 1: We roll dice Everyone has a sheet everyone starts with the same sheet Everyone gets the same inputs the in.

717
00:42:45,149 --> 00:42:56,219
Speaker 1: if we gave you all the inputs if we rolled all the dice in advance You could easily Everyone could just sit there and think for a long time and optimally put all the inputs in the right slots on the sheet To get the highest score.

718
00:42:56,601 --> 00:43:02,686
Speaker 1: But because you have to put them in one at a time and you don't know what the next inputs are going to be in The future it's like alright.

719
00:43:02,786 --> 00:43:03,729
Speaker 1: you had to gamble for it.

720
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:04,171
Speaker 1: Let me think.

721
00:43:04,251 --> 00:43:05,696
Speaker 1: real simple example, right?

722
00:43:06,278 --> 00:43:06,780
Speaker 1: Here's a game.

723
00:43:07,302 --> 00:43:09,048
Speaker 1: There's three squares, right?

724
00:43:09,771 --> 00:43:15,940
Speaker 1: if you put numbers in the squares in Increasing sequential order you get a perfect score.

725
00:43:16,943 --> 00:43:22,519
Speaker 1: If any numbers are out of order, then you you know, you you lose points every time.

726
00:43:22,539 --> 00:43:22,760
Speaker 1: a number.

727
00:43:23,362 --> 00:43:26,093
Speaker 0: This game I roll a d-hundred a 40 is rolled.

728
00:43:26,113 --> 00:43:26,635
Speaker 0: Where do you put it?

729
00:43:26,655 --> 00:43:27,599
Speaker 1: Do you put it in number one?

730
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,888
Speaker 1: Or number three, right?

731
00:43:29,988 --> 00:43:32,300
Speaker 1: It's like I. you're sort of gambling a little bit.

732
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:35,340
Speaker 1: So it is kind of luck, but you're also playing the odds, right?

733
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,820
Speaker 1: I would put my 40 in the middle slot and then the next roll is a 10.

734
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:43,304
Speaker 1: So I put that in the left slot and then the third roll is 20. ah fuck.

735
00:43:43,365 --> 00:43:43,787
Speaker 1: I got.

736
00:43:43,868 --> 00:43:44,572
Speaker 1: I got one row.

737
00:43:44,592 --> 00:43:45,075
Speaker 1: It's 100.

738
00:43:45,075 --> 00:43:52,549
Speaker 0: Yes, right Yeah, so typically what a lot of these games will have is another element where one the board will be bigger There's more places or something.

739
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it doesn't have to be places.

740
00:43:54,180 --> 00:44:00,700
Speaker 0: It can be lines it can be shapes like part of the reason why this genre I think is starting to like explode is that?

741
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:08,657
Speaker 0: With very minimal materials you can design like very different games Like in a very minimalist fashion.

742
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:11,450
Speaker 1: Yep So some examples of roll and rights I've played.

743
00:44:11,671 --> 00:44:12,695
Speaker 1: and the thing is roll and rights.

744
00:44:12,735 --> 00:44:18,013
Speaker 1: the best thing about them Is that there's no digging people over which turns people away from games a lot.

745
00:44:18,294 --> 00:44:18,896
Speaker 1: Yep, right?

746
00:44:19,077 --> 00:44:21,571
Speaker 0: There's no There could be but there is.

747
00:44:21,591 --> 00:44:25,220
Speaker 1: you can play them solitaire You can just sit there roll dice and try to get the best score.

748
00:44:25,421 --> 00:44:28,601
Speaker 0: These are games you could theoretically have an unlimited number of players Like.

749
00:44:28,621 --> 00:44:37,100
Speaker 1: you could have a panel where you're rolling dice at the front and everyone's yeah Just on the big screen in the front you could actually somebody should make one with jackbox technology.

750
00:44:38,401 --> 00:44:43,640
Speaker 1: Everyone Jack everyone fills out their sheet on their phone and then in the whole room We see who got the best sheet from the same dice.

751
00:44:44,142 --> 00:44:49,970
Speaker 0: I feel like if a pet if we're ever at a gaming con where they need extra panel content Let's run rolling rights for an entire room.

752
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:50,573
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's make it.

753
00:44:50,593 --> 00:44:52,080
Speaker 1: Let's make a jackbox rolling right anyway.

754
00:44:52,461 --> 00:44:56,715
Speaker 1: So examples of roll and rights I played recently that are hot are Ganshan clever.

755
00:44:56,956 --> 00:44:59,619
Speaker 0: That's the one I didn't play I've only played it solo.

756
00:44:59,861 --> 00:45:11,040
Speaker 1: I think I read the rules once and I vaguely remember reading something that when you play it With other people that like the dice you don't use go to the next person and there's some sort of interactivity.

757
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:14,359
Speaker 1: That's really fascinating which makes me it makes me want to play it with other people.

758
00:45:15,224 --> 00:45:20,128
Speaker 1: But when you play it solo, which you can do for free on the web There's sort of a janky web app, but it totally works.

759
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:31,150
Speaker 1: It's basically sort of like Yahtzee you roll the dice There's different dice of different colors and it's like, okay well I can use this dice for the number or for its color and then I take it and then I remove it and I roll The remaining dice and this.

760
00:45:31,514 --> 00:45:32,220
Speaker 1: you can read the rules.

761
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:40,365
Speaker 1: but you have a big of this really crazy score sheet and you can score in different spots on the sheet and It's like you sort of want to get.

762
00:45:40,586 --> 00:45:57,539
Speaker 1: you can try to pick one area and get in it a whole bunch or spread your Out over different areas and then when you reach certain Milestones and certain spots on the sheet you get bonus stuff like extra dice and extra fill-ins and I guess I don't know If it's mathematically possible to fill in the whole sheet.

763
00:45:57,942 --> 00:45:58,886
Speaker 1: I've never done that.

764
00:45:58,987 --> 00:46:04,420
Speaker 1: but you add up a score at the end and You get you know, you try to get hundreds of points or whatever.

765
00:46:04,601 --> 00:46:12,140
Speaker 0: so in a way this sort of functions like those rotating tournaments like in a bridge tournament where There's a table with a deck with an order of cards.

766
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:16,531
Speaker 0: So every group plays like the same deck to see who optimizes it's all.

767
00:46:16,992 --> 00:46:29,134
Speaker 0: it does that with a modern minimalist sensibility yep, and it does it well and the games are fun and I think rolling America is the one I played the most.

768
00:46:29,314 --> 00:46:30,940
Speaker 1: rolling America is real simple the way it works.

769
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,838
Speaker 1: You roll some roll dice, right?

770
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:36,260
Speaker 1: And then you have to put the numbers onto your map of America in these states.

771
00:46:36,561 --> 00:46:40,420
Speaker 0: But then the numbers like one through six can't be more than one away from all it.

772
00:46:40,581 --> 00:46:48,280
Speaker 1: So if I put five in Florida and if I put a four in Georgia I'm good because they're two adjacent states and their numbers are one apart from each other.

773
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:52,760
Speaker 1: But guess what Florida is also adjacent to what Alabama next to it, right?

774
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,653
Speaker 1: And it's like well, what if I get a I have to put a two and out?

775
00:46:55,693 --> 00:46:57,883
Speaker 1: if I put a three in Alabama That's good.

776
00:46:57,923 --> 00:47:01,195
Speaker 1: It's one away from Georgia, but it's two away from Florida.

777
00:47:01,216 --> 00:47:02,219
Speaker 1: That's not good.

778
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:11,975
Speaker 0: So another common element of these games then and this is what really makes these John those genres start to shine is Usually they'll give all the players a limited number of special powers.

779
00:47:12,015 --> 00:47:13,240
Speaker 0: They can use that their discretion.

780
00:47:14,086 --> 00:47:22,842
Speaker 0: so things like skip this role or Do this one twice or change a number or change a cut like something they can use a limited number of times a wildcard of Some kind right.

781
00:47:23,022 --> 00:47:29,118
Speaker 0: so which together with the rolling gives a very nice and distinct element of push your luck.

782
00:47:29,298 --> 00:47:31,609
Speaker 1: a good example This we played railroad Inc.

783
00:47:32,111 --> 00:47:32,795
Speaker 1: I nk.

784
00:47:32,855 --> 00:47:33,740
Speaker 0: I like that one a lot.

785
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,912
Speaker 0: We played it at PAX West West.

786
00:47:37,112 --> 00:47:38,819
Speaker 1: there's red and blue versions that was in first.

787
00:47:38,839 --> 00:47:43,651
Speaker 1: look Yeah, they're mostly the same game but there's red and blue versions that are slightly different and the way it works is this dice.

788
00:47:44,013 --> 00:47:50,863
Speaker 1: the dice have pictures on them of roads railroad tracks and Tunnels.

789
00:47:51,226 --> 00:47:55,512
Speaker 1: Yeah, all these sort of like, you know the transportation lines that you would draw like

790
00:47:55,553 --> 00:47:56,920
Speaker 0: SimCity looking transportation

791
00:47:57,101 --> 00:48:07,488
Speaker 1: Right and you the dice get rolled and everyone has a little dry erase grid and you have to put those Pictures onto your thing and make a network of Interconnecting roads and rails.

792
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:09,240
Speaker 1: and you don't want to leave dead ends.

793
00:48:09,502 --> 00:48:11,399
Speaker 1: You want things to connect to the edge of the board?

794
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,898
Speaker 1: You want to make you know a long road you want to.

795
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:17,130
Speaker 1: you know You want to arrange them in a way that scores the most points.

796
00:48:17,612 --> 00:48:21,591
Speaker 1: and then there's like like rim was saying this certain of like Get out of jail free make it.

797
00:48:21,611 --> 00:48:22,800
Speaker 1: you're allowed to make a few mistakes.

798
00:48:23,201 --> 00:48:27,480
Speaker 1: There's like a few dice you can better to sort of freebies you can use like once per game.

799
00:48:27,842 --> 00:48:28,404
Speaker 1: You can ignore.

800
00:48:28,424 --> 00:48:30,635
Speaker 1: you don't have to place every dice every time like you know.

801
00:48:30,715 --> 00:48:32,957
Speaker 1: ignore some Right the stuff like that.

802
00:48:33,301 --> 00:48:33,602
Speaker 1: So you don't.

803
00:48:33,722 --> 00:48:40,188
Speaker 1: if you're not like locked in everyone can approach the game really differently and with the same dice You're like four or five players.

804
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:41,897
Speaker 1: Everyone's boards are completely different.

805
00:48:41,937 --> 00:48:51,219
Speaker 0: Yep So the push your luck element the like risk/reward element, like I'm not doing well I'm going to take bigger risk Like there's a lot of things that make these games good.

806
00:48:51,802 --> 00:48:59,436
Speaker 0: But if you're like are a game designer and you want to like make some basic games and like try to design games This is a really good genre to try.

807
00:48:59,456 --> 00:49:04,580
Speaker 1: actually I just remembered there was a roll and write that I played after Yahtzee, which is roll through the ages.

808
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:06,607
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, roll through the ages.

809
00:49:06,647 --> 00:49:07,189
Speaker 1: hate that game.

810
00:49:07,329 --> 00:49:08,413
Speaker 1: It's basically Yahtzee.

811
00:49:08,674 --> 00:49:10,380
Speaker 1: It's really just Yahtzee with a different theme.

812
00:49:10,661 --> 00:49:12,367
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was like nothing about it.

813
00:49:12,448 --> 00:49:15,500
Speaker 1: that like was anything like the modern roll and writes.

814
00:49:16,062 --> 00:49:17,550
Speaker 1: But if you come I didn't think of it.

815
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:23,420
Speaker 0: if you come up with a good idea for something like this You can basically just make it with dice and dry erase stuff.

816
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,089
Speaker 1: Yeah, roll and writes are just so simple to make.

817
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:29,400
Speaker 1: there's actually there's a bunch of it's like text adventures, right?

818
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:36,022
Speaker 1: There's like communities of people just cranking out roll and writes and the fun part is usually the theme of the sheet of paper that They make.

819
00:49:36,443 --> 00:49:37,407
Speaker 1: yeah, right?

820
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:43,556
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, Ganshan clever is just like numbers on a board But a lot of the ones I see is like Halloween.

821
00:49:43,596 --> 00:49:51,460
Speaker 1: roll and write You know, it's like, you know, what I you know anime roll and rise, you know, you know would you go up?

822
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,600
Speaker 1: I'll put my six in my Super Saiyan area.

823
00:49:53,740 --> 00:50:05,680
Speaker 0: But the other thing about these is that just by their nature both physical and design wise they're really good to Bust out if you got like a weird number of people while you're waiting to start a bigger game a different game.

824
00:50:05,941 --> 00:50:07,646
Speaker 0: They're great to bust out at restaurants.

825
00:50:07,826 --> 00:50:10,213
Speaker 0: They're great to bust out in lines at conventions.

826
00:50:10,233 --> 00:50:12,420
Speaker 1: They're accessible to almost anybody.

827
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:18,500
Speaker 1: Right because it's sort of like, you know, it's the kind of thing you could just get one on your phone, you know I don't have it actually searched.

828
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:22,575
Speaker 1: I probably should for some phone apps of rolling rights because I can sit there and it's just.

829
00:50:22,615 --> 00:50:23,800
Speaker 1: you're just solving this puzzle.

830
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:34,520
Speaker 1: All right, it's like as opposed to a puzzle that you would normally solve where it's like, okay, you know There's one correct solution find it you have all the time in the world.

831
00:50:34,681 --> 00:50:34,962
Speaker 1: It's like.

832
00:50:35,022 --> 00:50:40,140
Speaker 1: no the inputs come in a certain order and you can only see what one input at a time without knowing the future.

833
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,309
Speaker 1: Inputs, but they're also eyes it that way.

834
00:50:42,449 --> 00:50:45,060
Speaker 0: they're not random in the sense of oh you just rolled double sixes.

835
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:45,943
Speaker 0: That's why you won.

836
00:50:46,124 --> 00:50:50,940
Speaker 0: It's you made the optimal decisions based on the inputs that we all shared.

837
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:53,913
Speaker 0: Yep, so check these games out.

838
00:50:54,014 --> 00:51:03,180
Speaker 0: This is going to be a Fast growing and I think very popular sector of tabletop and I think it's already a fast growing and popular section of tabletop.

839
00:51:03,361 --> 00:51:08,600
Speaker 1: It's like and I don't think it's Reese's Peak yet, but I think it will level off, but I don't think it'll go away.

840
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,027
Speaker 1: I think this will be like a constant.

841
00:51:10,288 --> 00:51:12,520
Speaker 1: There'll always be a few rolling rights hanging out.

842
00:51:13,322 --> 00:51:14,560
Speaker 1: There's always some text adventures.

843
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:20,360
Speaker 0: I think it's gonna level off and then there's good as like someone's gonna come up with a clever twist on the genre.

844
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:24,433
Speaker 1: There are already tons of clever twists exactly.

845
00:51:24,473 --> 00:51:26,460
Speaker 0: I think people will keep coming up with clever twists.

846
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:31,327
Speaker 1: Yeah the one that's one that's hot right now that I played is called welcome to where you have to.

847
00:51:31,347 --> 00:51:40,740
Speaker 1: you have like this town and you're like Putting things into houses and the sheet of paper that you fill out looks really nice and it's like there's certain score bonuses for like.

848
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:47,608
Speaker 1: You know the houses with the pools and you draw fences between the houses and you want to make groups Of houses that are like together.

849
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:48,612
Speaker 1: nicely, right?

850
00:51:48,733 --> 00:51:54,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, it wasn't bad But I don't think it was as fun as some of the other ones but it's really popular right now.

851
00:51:54,181 --> 00:51:54,999
Speaker 1: People are way into it.

852
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:56,386
Speaker 0: But think about the kind of things you could do.

853
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:57,170
Speaker 0: you could play a game.

854
00:51:57,210 --> 00:52:01,519
Speaker 0: you can have a game like this where there's a Shared space multiple people are writing on.

855
00:52:01,769 --> 00:52:08,350
Speaker 0: Yep You could do something like between two cities where like you and me Share a board and then me and the person in my right share a board.

856
00:52:08,571 --> 00:52:11,892
Speaker 0: there are the possibilities of this tiny Between two rules.

857
00:52:12,196 --> 00:52:17,733
Speaker 0: Yeah Though I think this is a space that you should watch closely and play these games.

858
00:52:18,475 --> 00:52:18,916
Speaker 1: I make some.

859
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:20,020
Speaker 0: yeah, I'll make one.

860
00:52:26,274 --> 00:52:28,810
Speaker 0: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
