1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,363
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday September 6th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:13,403 --> 00:00:15,368
Speaker 1: We review mobile suit Gundam.

3
00:00:15,489 --> 00:00:18,467
Speaker 1: see Let's do this.

4
00:00:19,393 --> 00:00:20,196
Speaker 0: You know more and more.

5
00:00:20,397 --> 00:00:29,711
Speaker 0: I'm starting to be of the mind that if you cause a car accident And it's rush hour the police should just bulldoze your car off the side of the road and they'll deal with you after rush Hours over.

6
00:00:30,253 --> 00:00:32,339
Speaker 1: yeah, I think that's what they should do.

7
00:00:32,378 --> 00:00:38,339
Speaker 1: you know what actually I thought about this some more in the a1 grand Pre not the f1 grand pre.

8
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:42,037
Speaker 1: the a1 grand pre if a car crashes You know how they get it off the track.

9
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:43,184
Speaker 0: with the giant crane.

10
00:00:43,365 --> 00:00:47,630
Speaker 1: no with a giant helicopter A helicopter comes over picks up your car and goes away.

11
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,790
Speaker 1: It takes like a minute, but it's because the helicopters right there.

12
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,742
Speaker 1: But you know a helicopter you get there pretty quick, and how expensive that would be.

13
00:00:54,762 --> 00:00:57,270
Speaker 1: it is that the a1 grand free is very.

14
00:00:58,471 --> 00:01:00,377
Speaker 1: What's the the words expensive?

15
00:01:00,658 --> 00:01:01,019
Speaker 1: Yeah?

16
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,443
Speaker 1: It's all froofy and rich people, but you know hoity-toity Heard of that kind of raising.

17
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,149
Speaker 0: how does it make money?

18
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:16,905
Speaker 1: The a1 grand free is sort of like the international Race of whatever where everyone gets the same car, and there's not every.

19
00:01:16,925 --> 00:01:22,701
Speaker 1: no no no I mean since a different country I'd never heard of it because everyone outside the US actually cares.

20
00:01:23,222 --> 00:01:26,030
Speaker 1: I'm sure especially lots of rich Arab guys in Dubai.

21
00:01:27,317 --> 00:01:29,848
Speaker 1: Aha Who own it all right?

22
00:01:30,572 --> 00:01:46,606
Speaker 0: Anyway, I just found it funny that I was once again five miles from my house And then there was an accident somewhere off in the distance on Interstate 84 Which since it's one of the two roads that goes east-west in the Dutchess County Completely stopped all traffic within about 40 miles.

23
00:01:47,844 --> 00:01:52,450
Speaker 0: No of course being clever I Pulled a bit of shenanigans.

24
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:56,250
Speaker 0: I turned away from where this was and then I went around a loop-de-loop.

25
00:01:56,672 --> 00:02:02,956
Speaker 0: And then I know and I end up skipping all of these people and all this crazy traffic That was stuck trying to get out of the street.

26
00:02:02,996 --> 00:02:06,330
Speaker 0: I needed to get on thus saving myself about 40 minutes.

27
00:02:06,952 --> 00:02:07,656
Speaker 1: Oh, that's good.

28
00:02:08,138 --> 00:02:09,905
Speaker 0: I can't believe no one ever thinks to do anything like that.

29
00:02:09,966 --> 00:02:10,949
Speaker 0: I didn't do anything illegal.

30
00:02:11,111 --> 00:02:12,718
Speaker 0: I just turning left.

31
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:18,478
Speaker 0: There was like a dumb two mile line to turn left and That you couldn't turn left because the road was blocked.

32
00:02:18,498 --> 00:02:25,045
Speaker 0: so it went really slow and like one car get through every light cycle if That so I went up with no resistance at all past all these cars.

33
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:32,223
Speaker 0: I turned right and Then I just did a u-turn on the street right there and now I'm on the street I need to be on and I just go straight through the next light.

34
00:02:33,149 --> 00:02:45,810
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah I Couldn't believe no one thought of that and I looked and the same car that was sitting there at the front of this trying to Get in was still sitting there by the time I had made it back to the road and then I went past him.

35
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:49,692
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is if everyone did do it, it probably It would.

36
00:02:49,813 --> 00:02:51,982
Speaker 1: it would free up one part of the road, but then it would go.

37
00:02:52,002 --> 00:02:52,343
Speaker 0: No.

38
00:02:52,404 --> 00:02:53,950
Speaker 0: No, I'm not saying everyone should do it.

39
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:54,914
Speaker 0: That'd be terrible.

40
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,969
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just wonder why no one ever thinks to do anything like that.

41
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:06,450
Speaker 1: Sometimes I think to do things like that But you know really depends on the road and where you're trying to get to is always a big factor because it's like yeah.

42
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:13,150
Speaker 0: Well, I know like before we were both stuck in a traffic jam once and I remember you Were sitting there gurgle girl.

43
00:03:13,552 --> 00:03:19,996
Speaker 0: I cut off to the left and it drove around crazily and all these side streets and ended up at you Yeah by two cars.

44
00:03:20,016 --> 00:03:25,470
Speaker 0: I knew that that wouldn't help that much, you know, you know what it would have if I would have had Balls to drive up a one-way street.

45
00:03:25,863 --> 00:03:26,553
Speaker 0: Yeah But I didn't.

46
00:03:26,694 --> 00:03:33,403
Speaker 1: I sat there and I thought about it and I didn't have the cajones I know because I knew that that didn't go as far enough to be useful.

47
00:03:33,503 --> 00:03:36,593
Speaker 1: and then we got to another part where it was Essentially a gamble.

48
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:44,722
Speaker 1: I could either I knew that I could go straight or turn right and I figured okay going right is probably more Road, but there's probably no traffic on it.

49
00:03:44,782 --> 00:03:50,590
Speaker 1: going straight is less road But if there's no traffic, I'll get there quicker and if there is traffic, I'm screwed.

50
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:54,910
Speaker 0: So I went right and and then uh, yeah, I went straight and there was no traffic at all.

51
00:03:55,231 --> 00:03:59,550
Speaker 1: Hey, it was a gamble, you know, and it didn't get there much later than you maybe like five minutes.

52
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,322
Speaker 0: Don't worry Atlantic City paid for that gas.

53
00:04:01,523 --> 00:04:04,021
Speaker 1: Yeah Gas is going down now.

54
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:04,766
Speaker 1: So it's not so bad.

55
00:04:05,008 --> 00:04:11,947
Speaker 0: Yeah It's funny that it's really affecting me and I have I'm losing much more much less money per week.

56
00:04:11,987 --> 00:04:12,408
Speaker 0: Suddenly.

57
00:04:12,428 --> 00:04:16,629
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean a difference of 30, you know, 20 30 cents really matters.

58
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:24,176
Speaker 1: Well difference of for me like when I bought gas in New Jersey, I saved like six bucks, you know And that's like six bucks a week.

59
00:04:24,678 --> 00:04:25,784
Speaker 1: Yeah, not bad.

60
00:04:26,045 --> 00:04:27,130
Speaker 0: I use more than a tank a week.

61
00:04:27,672 --> 00:04:30,225
Speaker 1: Oh, I know I use like a tank in some a week.

62
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,294
Speaker 1: I Didn't go to work today though.

63
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:32,857
Speaker 1: So I use less.

64
00:04:33,198 --> 00:04:33,419
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

65
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:51,709
Speaker 0: Anyway in the news now I can't wait till next week to talk about this and I I didn't think I'd ever have any more news about Sony until they released the PlayStation 3 and I can't believe That they got not one but two Double horrible whammies of death in the news today.

66
00:04:52,231 --> 00:04:55,662
Speaker 1: But I can believe it because that it happens every single day.

67
00:04:55,822 --> 00:04:58,190
Speaker 0: Why hasn't the CEO of Sony committed seppuku yet?

68
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,824
Speaker 0: This is like it's not even to the point of yeah, so he's getting what they deserved.

69
00:05:03,405 --> 00:05:06,659
Speaker 0: if they're just being there I don't know what's going on anymore.

70
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,650
Speaker 0: I can't believe they would be this incompetent.

71
00:05:08,811 --> 00:05:12,610
Speaker 1: They I mean if only they weren't Japanese we could interview them.

72
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:16,070
Speaker 0: I mean I rip on Sony all the time for you know, the things they've been doing lately.

73
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,254
Speaker 0: But they're not.

74
00:05:17,354 --> 00:05:26,930
Speaker 0: at least I didn't think that they were run by stupid people because the PlayStation 2 and the PlayStation 1 Made crazy amounts of money when no one really expected them to originally.

75
00:05:27,855 --> 00:05:29,544
Speaker 0: I mean they went up against the monopoly.

76
00:05:29,604 --> 00:05:45,589
Speaker 1: the ultimate Nintendo Maybe that's the trick is when you know when you're the underdog in an industry where there's actually competition you actually try and end up doing well and When you're so high up you just think ah ha ha ha and then you fail.

77
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:54,557
Speaker 1: I mean if you look at video game consoles over history, you know people it's basically someone becomes dominant But they never stay dominant.

78
00:05:54,778 --> 00:05:56,826
Speaker 1: Everyone goes up and then crashes.

79
00:05:56,866 --> 00:06:02,654
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least recently I mean when Nintendo went up it was the undisputed king for a long time and then it came down But it managed.

80
00:06:02,734 --> 00:06:06,210
Speaker 1: it was up for so long that it was able to hold out through the long course.

81
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:12,530
Speaker 0: Everyone Sega didn't say it didn't but everyone always forgets that the GameCube was number two for a long time.

82
00:06:13,152 --> 00:06:16,725
Speaker 0: And while the Xbox eventually edged it out by a tiny bit in the u.s.

83
00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:18,230
Speaker 1: It didn't edge it out anywhere else.

84
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:22,021
Speaker 0: Yeah worldwide the GameCube is number two not number three.

85
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:28,848
Speaker 0: Well, if you don't count like the Xbox 360 or whatever Well, yeah, but I wouldn't count the Wii either or the PSP.

86
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:36,950
Speaker 1: I know in terms of the pre the Generation the ending generation the presently ending generation the GameCube was number two in the world.

87
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:40,184
Speaker 0: Yeah, so take that even though you're up in places.

88
00:06:40,264 --> 00:06:51,222
Speaker 0: No one gives a shit about the GameCube yeah, but anyway the news about Sony first was that they've decided to Cut back on their release and instead of releasing it worldwide this year.

89
00:06:51,242 --> 00:07:01,328
Speaker 0: They claim sometime in November possibly They're only releasing it in the US and Japan now and the rest of the world isn't getting it until at the earliest March of next year.

90
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,817
Speaker 1: That's pretty much standard fare.

91
00:07:03,897 --> 00:07:04,861
Speaker 1: I mean the rest of the world.

92
00:07:04,921 --> 00:07:06,005
Speaker 1: Yeah doesn't get anything.

93
00:07:06,045 --> 00:07:07,370
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is alright.

94
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:11,469
Speaker 0: I'm fine with that and originally they said it was gonna come out quarter one of next year.

95
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:16,130
Speaker 0: But then they said no, we're gonna have a worldwide release this year.

96
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,114
Speaker 1: When did they say that?

97
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,119
Speaker 0: a while ago?

98
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:23,325
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, and then they came back and said nope We pushed back the release for everywhere.

99
00:07:23,345 --> 00:07:24,270
Speaker 0: That isn't us in Japan.

100
00:07:25,172 --> 00:07:36,730
Speaker 1: I think it's just hard for me now to follow like which things are Sony press releases or Sony and people saying something You know and some guy just saying something he found out and I just really don't care anymore.

101
00:07:36,951 --> 00:07:40,763
Speaker 0: Well, then almost immediately and slash shot picked this up right away.

102
00:07:40,783 --> 00:07:42,810
Speaker 0: It was reported just why they had done this.

103
00:07:43,373 --> 00:07:45,606
Speaker 0: Remember that blue laser diode thing.

104
00:07:45,626 --> 00:07:53,930
Speaker 0: Yep There's basically this thing that blu-ray needs and it's for some reason either difficult to manufacture or something happened.

105
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,859
Speaker 0: But there aren't enough of them in the world and they can't be made fast enough.

106
00:07:57,762 --> 00:08:02,419
Speaker 0: as a result instead of having two million PlayStation 3 is ready for the launch.

107
00:08:02,821 --> 00:08:05,798
Speaker 0: They're going to have maybe 500,000. well, that's not enough.

108
00:08:05,798 --> 00:08:10,157
Speaker 0: 400,000 of them are going to the u.s.

109
00:08:10,438 --> 00:08:12,304
Speaker 0: And 100,000 are going to Japan.

110
00:08:12,444 --> 00:08:15,494
Speaker 1: Wait, why would they give more to the u.s When Japan?

111
00:08:15,514 --> 00:08:16,679
Speaker 0: that's what I was about to say.

112
00:08:16,719 --> 00:08:18,146
Speaker 0: because while the u.s.

113
00:08:18,186 --> 00:08:23,657
Speaker 0: Is a larger market the Japanese Despite the fact that Sony isn't doing so well.

114
00:08:23,998 --> 00:08:27,309
Speaker 0: There is this loyalty towards Sony that is somewhat fierce over there.

115
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:32,183
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would just sell them all in Japan and not only will will.

116
00:08:32,203 --> 00:08:35,068
Speaker 0: this probably generate a lot of ill will for Sony in Japan.

117
00:08:35,735 --> 00:08:37,690
Speaker 0: But I don't even know anymore.

118
00:08:37,971 --> 00:08:41,602
Speaker 0: I have no more useful commentary about Sony other than that you have pulled a Jack Thompson.

119
00:08:41,663 --> 00:08:43,530
Speaker 0: you caused me to talk about you again.

120
00:08:43,751 --> 00:08:49,290
Speaker 1: I think the the thing is with Sony is that you know, because they screwed up a whole mess of things, right?

121
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:55,608
Speaker 1: You know the price is too high on a giant overheating system that people don't really want and etc, etc.

122
00:08:57,593 --> 00:08:59,313
Speaker 1: A lot of this.

123
00:08:59,393 --> 00:09:04,658
Speaker 1: things now are like bashing for the sake of bashing like the people who are like Oh, it doesn't come with the cable.

124
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:06,770
Speaker 1: Well, the Xbox 360 doesn't come with the cable.

125
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,697
Speaker 0: What is the game cue?

126
00:09:07,718 --> 00:09:09,230
Speaker 1: or did nothing comes with the cable?

127
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:15,630
Speaker 1: It's you know, it's like they're bashing Sony for things that everyone does, you know as if Sony's even worse than it is.

128
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:16,333
Speaker 0: You know what though?

129
00:09:16,353 --> 00:09:20,170
Speaker 0: I think they deserve bashing for these two bits of gem ish news.

130
00:09:20,732 --> 00:09:25,147
Speaker 1: Yeah, if that's real news, hey, you know, but it's sort of like they had.

131
00:09:25,187 --> 00:09:28,910
Speaker 1: you know, it's Like you're bashing them for returning to the status quo.

132
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,095
Speaker 1: It's like they may.

133
00:09:30,215 --> 00:09:33,470
Speaker 1: they made a grandiose promise like we're gonna do better than usual.

134
00:09:33,711 --> 00:09:34,897
Speaker 1: See, but I don't know.

135
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:38,315
Speaker 1: we're gonna do what people normally do and then you're like, oh you suck You're gonna do it.

136
00:09:38,335 --> 00:09:40,450
Speaker 0: know people normally but Sony seems to do this a lot.

137
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:48,586
Speaker 0: They always seem to say things are gonna be great and things are gonna be awesome And then when it comes time to actually say as in here it is.

138
00:09:48,646 --> 00:09:56,836
Speaker 0: We're releasing it Suddenly half the things they said before just kind of get forgotten or yeah We can't actually make that many here.

139
00:09:57,277 --> 00:10:00,065
Speaker 0: No, it's not gonna have two HDMI ports.

140
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,770
Speaker 1: Well, that's the complaint everyone made.

141
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:08,993
Speaker 1: You know when they first showed the ps2 at the e3 long ago They had like, you know the emotion engine and all this fancy shit They talked about.

142
00:10:09,053 --> 00:10:13,650
Speaker 1: and yeah people pointed out at last e3 that none of that stuff ever came to be.

143
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:19,550
Speaker 0: I think the rule is you can only overhype yourself once and it'll only work once.

144
00:10:19,971 --> 00:10:34,651
Speaker 0: Because if I say that my hundred dollar bill is worth a hundred and ten dollars and a bunch of people buy my Hundred and ten dollar hundred dollar bills and then they realize they got ripped off They're not gonna listen to me next year when I say I'm selling 115 dollar bills Well,

145
00:10:34,691 --> 00:10:35,978
Speaker 1: I think what it really is.

146
00:10:35,998 --> 00:10:52,006
Speaker 1: the problem is back in the days even when the ps2 came out the video game magazine was still the king over the video game website and people would get a video game magazine or two and they'd read them once a month and There'd be lots of stuff in there like oh, this is gonna happen.

147
00:10:52,046 --> 00:10:52,790
Speaker 1: This is gonna happen.

148
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:59,630
Speaker 1: it's gonna have this and that and what now and screenshots and everything and People wouldn't remember all the details in those things.

149
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:08,537
Speaker 1: So if you said something like oh, yeah, we're gonna have a thousand gigahertz and you add 500 gigahertz in the end Probably very few people would notice or care true.

150
00:11:08,598 --> 00:11:13,510
Speaker 1: But now people are reading the video game news every single day.

151
00:11:13,651 --> 00:11:24,293
Speaker 1: They're reading the same news and every single piece of information you release there Getting told time and time again as links show up again and again and all the different websites They read.

152
00:11:24,777 --> 00:11:26,750
Speaker 1: so you basically can't lie.

153
00:11:27,111 --> 00:11:31,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I noticed that Nintendo and Microsoft are doing real well in this regard.

154
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:38,610
Speaker 0: I mean Nintendo hasn't lied yet about anything because every time they say something they're smart enough to where if they don't know.

155
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,879
Speaker 0: I think they qualify everything so much.

156
00:11:40,939 --> 00:11:44,150
Speaker 1: I think the thing is that it won't be more than $250.

157
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,530
Speaker 0: it'll come out before the end.

158
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:55,850
Speaker 1: I think Nintendo's strategy is alright to avoid lying and also because you don't want to tell the truth That's the worst thing you can possibly do is to give out all the information too soon or at the wrong time.

159
00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:02,850
Speaker 1: Nintendo is just either they say nothing or they're super vague or it all comes out suddenly.

160
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:10,553
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, they tell everything they have exact like dates and times what information they're gonna say when and they figured it out with All sorts of science.

161
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,103
Speaker 1: and while it's annoying for us because we're just like.

162
00:12:13,323 --> 00:12:14,668
Speaker 1: tell us tell us you know.

163
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:18,536
Speaker 1: like Apple You know a lot of people like tell us yeah Well goddamn but to the to the.

164
00:12:18,677 --> 00:12:22,653
Speaker 1: uh and it creates lots of rumors, but better than lies You know.

165
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:23,879
Speaker 0: yeah, of course.

166
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:26,350
Speaker 0: It's not like Apple where people believe some of those crazy rumors.

167
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:31,410
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone believed the rumor that the Wii back before it was called the Wii was gonna have a hole.

168
00:12:31,611 --> 00:12:46,087
Speaker 1: I think the reason people believe a lot of Apple rumors is because the think secret and Apple insider You know have sort of this track record of being like you know Mildly accurate on the rumors like they're like between 25 and 50 percent accurate.

169
00:12:46,167 --> 00:12:48,505
Speaker 0: You know oh great Yeah, so less than drudge.

170
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:53,126
Speaker 1: well I know, but the point is is that you know they get a lot of stuff right you know.

171
00:12:53,207 --> 00:12:55,624
Speaker 1: and when you're shooting You know machine gun bullets everywhere.

172
00:12:55,644 --> 00:13:00,359
Speaker 0: You're gonna hit something That Apple is going to come out with a product.

173
00:13:00,641 --> 00:13:03,930
Speaker 1: the point is is you know you read a site like that And it's the same thing psych.

174
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:05,181
Speaker 1: You know way psychics work is.

175
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:10,230
Speaker 1: you read a bunch of facts And then if a bunch of them turn to be true you remember the true ones you don't remember all the wrong ones.

176
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:15,386
Speaker 1: You know it's like a no B. No see I go through the whole alphabet.

177
00:13:15,406 --> 00:13:17,841
Speaker 1: if I got the letter right eventually You'd be like oh my god.

178
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:18,467
Speaker 1: He got it, right.

179
00:13:19,912 --> 00:13:25,850
Speaker 1: Okay, so my news In Japan unlike the u.s.. People revere video game music.

180
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,080
Speaker 0: Yes, something that should be more revered here.

181
00:13:29,161 --> 00:13:31,390
Speaker 0: I mean yeah, I was no see remixes constantly.

182
00:13:31,631 --> 00:13:36,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean in the u.s.. You're only gonna get a soundtrack for a major motion picture.

183
00:13:36,271 --> 00:13:40,510
Speaker 1: You know you can get a soundtrack for some non-major motion pictures if you hunt around.

184
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:48,800
Speaker 0: Well Alex went around and found the original rip soundtrack from a Gameboy game be like and then he found a way to play That soundtrack just so you could listen to it.

185
00:13:48,981 --> 00:13:53,718
Speaker 1: Yep now In Japan they put out soundtracks for everything.

186
00:13:53,758 --> 00:13:55,924
Speaker 1: in fact they put up multiple soundtracks for everything.

187
00:13:56,005 --> 00:13:57,690
Speaker 1: in fact they put out image albums.

188
00:13:58,051 --> 00:14:03,105
Speaker 0: Yes an image album is essentially a soundtrack that contains music that was never actually in.

189
00:14:03,145 --> 00:14:04,749
Speaker 0: whatever it was you bought the soundtrack to.

190
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:04,970
Speaker 0: yeah.

191
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,950
Speaker 1: So let's say there was an image album for the Lord of the Rings movie.

192
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,918
Speaker 1: That's like that would be.

193
00:14:09,938 --> 00:14:17,356
Speaker 1: so there's a guy who's composing music for the Lord of the Rings movie and while he's doing that he composes some other music and He also you know.

194
00:14:17,376 --> 00:14:19,743
Speaker 0: so it would be like the battle song they didn't use.

195
00:14:19,864 --> 00:14:25,308
Speaker 0: and then the song they wrote about Aragorn because they felt like writing a song about Aragorn that they knew they wouldn't use.

196
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:32,722
Speaker 1: yeah And a song that like you know they'll that captures a certain mood But you know they didn't actually use that song for them.

197
00:14:32,803 --> 00:14:37,440
Speaker 0: the hobbits are walking Yeah, and that's an image album.

198
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,837
Speaker 1: so in Japan they put out albums for everything including Phoenix Wright.

199
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:51,990
Speaker 1: Oh God no wait wait and not only did they put out albums for everything, but who's gonna buy a CD with just some Kind of GBA music?

200
00:14:52,652 --> 00:14:54,698
Speaker 0: Is the answer here that they made an audio drama?

201
00:14:55,099 --> 00:14:57,687
Speaker 0: no the answer is that usually they make an audio drama.

202
00:14:57,707 --> 00:14:58,550
Speaker 1: the answer is that?

203
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:05,103
Speaker 1: They cut you know ye old orchestra to play on Phoenix Wright soundtrack Just like they do with.

204
00:15:05,163 --> 00:15:07,416
Speaker 1: you know Smash Brothers and all those you know.

205
00:15:07,517 --> 00:15:09,566
Speaker 0: I remember when I was God.

206
00:15:09,606 --> 00:15:17,961
Speaker 0: This is pretty much before mp3s were widely available And I remember I ordered and it came

207
00:15:18,021 --> 00:15:18,824
Speaker 1: the Final Fantasy from

208
00:15:18,864 --> 00:15:34,530
Speaker 0: Japan this Final Fantasy concert and I paid like 40 bucks for this CD and I remember listening to an orchestra playing the music from Final Fantasy and being so blown away by this and Marveling at the wondrous nation that was Japan.

209
00:15:35,012 --> 00:15:37,645
Speaker 1: I don't know where all the orchestras at if I ever get a lot of money.

210
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:38,550
Speaker 1: I'm buying an orchestra.

211
00:15:39,052 --> 00:15:40,117
Speaker 0: There's orchestras everywhere.

212
00:15:40,157 --> 00:15:40,418
Speaker 0: There's.

213
00:15:40,499 --> 00:15:43,050
Speaker 0: there are like four orchestras here Scott.

214
00:15:43,273 --> 00:15:44,248
Speaker 1: We should buy one of them.

215
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:46,680
Speaker 0: We could donate enough money to where they'd.

216
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,090
Speaker 0: let us do things like tell them what to play.

217
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,079
Speaker 1: That's essentially buying them, which is good enough.

218
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,650
Speaker 0: You can do like what they did in that Marx Brothers movie.

219
00:15:53,751 --> 00:15:54,217
Speaker 0: I showed you.

220
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,304
Speaker 1: yeah exactly No, but yeah, just be a wealthy benefit Phoenix.

221
00:15:59,364 --> 00:16:05,570
Speaker 1: right music CD This morning when I got this link this thing of the day or not?

222
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:06,596
Speaker 1: It's not a thing of days.

223
00:16:06,616 --> 00:16:14,870
Speaker 1: the news this morning when I found this news There was links to some mp3 samples of the album But they're not working now, so I'm unhappy.

224
00:16:16,211 --> 00:16:17,356
Speaker 1: That's all I got to say about that.

225
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,808
Speaker 1: This was a better news when there were mp3 links.

226
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:28,168
Speaker 0: things of the day.

227
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:46,147
Speaker 0: Now as the most important issue of Death Note has come out in America And I'm sure you all who were reading Death Note have read it I have a very special Death Note related thing of the day that I'd kind of been saving and I'd also kind of forgotten about until a couple days ago.

228
00:16:48,131 --> 00:16:56,947
Speaker 0: Okay, though also I have a clue because I said I'd do this as to what my thing of the day tomorrow will be and That it involves naked men.

229
00:16:57,832 --> 00:17:03,507
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, I think that someone we know is probably gonna get it based on just that paid better.

230
00:17:03,788 --> 00:17:07,910
Speaker 0: Good God Though all of the guesses we received were completely incorrect.

231
00:17:08,012 --> 00:17:14,445
Speaker 1: Yeah, no I think that we could possibly make this thing come back because it was a huge thing like years ago.

232
00:17:16,011 --> 00:17:20,848
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then it hasn't returned and I've noticed this trend of old things that I've.

233
00:17:20,888 --> 00:17:24,010
Speaker 1: you know We're awesome years ago returning and getting to the top of dig.

234
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:28,626
Speaker 0: So I'm waiting for Radis skull and devil doll to make it again Halloween man.

235
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:29,650
Speaker 1: That's when they're coming back.

236
00:17:29,952 --> 00:17:31,098
Speaker 0: I think that should be our mission.

237
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,919
Speaker 0: I think it should be but anyway tomorrow I will reveal the mystery of the naked men.

238
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:39,723
Speaker 0: and no the naked men are not myself and Scott though That may be the case in the near future.

239
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:40,910
Speaker 0: I smell a cosplay.

240
00:17:42,671 --> 00:17:54,744
Speaker 0: Anyway, my thing of the day today is Simply L trying to get a love potion from Snape the potions master and I'm not gonna ruin it.

241
00:17:54,784 --> 00:17:55,346
Speaker 0: Just watch it.

242
00:17:55,446 --> 00:17:56,108
Speaker 0: It's hilarious.

243
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,759
Speaker 0: I would rate it pg-13 for a slight amount of rape.

244
00:18:04,081 --> 00:18:05,045
Speaker 1: Yes, this is.

245
00:18:05,426 --> 00:18:09,340
Speaker 1: this is the kind of stuff that is usually reserved for the realm of fan crap.

246
00:18:09,782 --> 00:18:15,245
Speaker 1: However, its production quality is over the line and its humor is over the line So it gets a pass.

247
00:18:15,587 --> 00:18:25,817
Speaker 0: see I like these things a lot more than Scott does I mean, it's very similar to anyone who's seen the old classic bothering Snape ba ba ba ba ba ba.

248
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,924
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway It's really well done.

249
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:32,406
Speaker 0: Check it out.

250
00:18:32,526 --> 00:18:33,570
Speaker 0: The rapes not so bad.

251
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,474
Speaker 0: I think you can get past it.

252
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:42,397
Speaker 0: Plus remember it's a Cute boy character from Death Note doing something to another character from Death Note.

253
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:43,300
Speaker 0: It was also a boy.

254
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,205
Speaker 1: I'll just say that I like it.

255
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:51,811
Speaker 1: when people use copyrighted characters to make entertaining things to show that again Copyright laws BS.

256
00:18:52,517 --> 00:18:55,156
Speaker 0: Oh It's not illegal in Japan.

257
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:55,660
Speaker 0: I'm a phone.

258
00:18:56,701 --> 00:19:00,711
Speaker 0: It is technically maybe but yeah, but it's not nearly the way it is here.

259
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:04,020
Speaker 1: copyright and patent laws are hindering creativity not helping.

260
00:19:04,421 --> 00:19:09,800
Speaker 0: Yes, because if you enjoy what we showed or what my thing of the day was bear in mind that that was totally illegal.

261
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:11,971
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're not allowed to use those copyrighted characters.

262
00:19:12,272 --> 00:19:22,039
Speaker 1: anyway, it's not a parody, okay This is something that I think a lot of people have been asking for even though we kind of Sorted did an episode on it a little bit maybe.

263
00:19:23,401 --> 00:19:31,042
Speaker 1: It is very detailed and complete instructions on how to throw a large room party at a science fiction Convention.

264
00:19:31,102 --> 00:19:40,980
Speaker 1: now if you replace the word science fiction with anime or comic or gaming You won't have to change much else on the entire page because this is pretty much where it's at.

265
00:19:41,189 --> 00:19:50,740
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean Scott sent it to me and I was reading it and it read almost Exactly, like how we have planned parties in the past and how we continue to plan parties.

266
00:19:51,182 --> 00:19:54,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean even if you don't plan on throwing a party at a convention, it's pretty funny.

267
00:19:55,676 --> 00:20:09,522
Speaker 1: I mean Especially when you look at the like party essentials list cheese and a veggie knife bottle opener corkscrew Cash preferably in small bills common sense a bottle of ibuprofen Willing minions, you know It's.

268
00:20:09,622 --> 00:20:09,783
Speaker 1: it's.

269
00:20:09,944 --> 00:20:10,446
Speaker 1: it's funny.

270
00:20:10,607 --> 00:20:22,792
Speaker 1: Even if you aren't going to take it seriously to throw a party but if you are gonna throw a party print this out and bring it with you and read it before your party and after your party and during your party and Make sure you do things, right?

271
00:20:22,812 --> 00:20:32,580
Speaker 1: I Pretty much guarantee that if you follow these directions, you will have a successful good time because this thing is dead-on It is pretty much a bull's-eye.

272
00:20:33,724 --> 00:20:40,940
Speaker 0: But anyway without further ado today We are going to go back to our typical show format of reviewing anime.

273
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,200
Speaker 1: Holy crap!

274
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,081
Speaker 0: Fancy that!

275
00:20:43,342 --> 00:21:00,151
Speaker 0: Con season's almost wound down to the point that we can finally start doing something other than talk about cons Even though even though I still have Otacon content that we have not used yet Great the recording of the assassination attempt by certain unnamed forces.

276
00:21:00,171 --> 00:21:01,354
Speaker 1: I thought you put it up already.

277
00:21:01,535 --> 00:21:01,796
Speaker 0: No.

278
00:21:02,437 --> 00:21:03,500
Speaker 0: Oh, when would I put that up?

279
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,060
Speaker 1: I thought it was in another episode.

280
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:16,620
Speaker 0: No, because the whole panel we did was good and I just didn't get a chance to edit it because it takes Basically because of the way we recorded the stuff at Otacon do mostly to the fact that GarageBand is evil.

281
00:21:16,922 --> 00:21:22,475
Speaker 0: Yep, it takes a lot of manual Annoying editing to make it not sound bad.

282
00:21:22,858 --> 00:21:34,360
Speaker 0: as a result I haven't gotten around to actually putting that bit together yet But suffice to say someday in the near future You will actually be able to hear the moment at which Daryl Surratt so valiantly tried to slay me and Scott of geek night.

283
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,204
Speaker 1: Well, we are slain.

284
00:21:35,244 --> 00:21:36,490
Speaker 1: I mean aren't we zamabis now?

285
00:21:36,892 --> 00:21:42,155
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I'm a more of a vampire Vampire, you know vampires aren't things that you realize.

286
00:21:42,376 --> 00:21:43,420
Speaker 1: slain and come back.

287
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,390
Speaker 1: You realize you pretty much have a choice to do like zombie and ghosts.

288
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:54,904
Speaker 0: you realize the moment I said I'm a vampire Scott Johnson Got his cross and his steak and already in the car on the way to beacon Well, I'm a ghoul.

289
00:21:54,984 --> 00:21:56,750
Speaker 1: So that's a much better choice.

290
00:21:56,931 --> 00:21:58,275
Speaker 0: cool smell like asses.

291
00:21:58,295 --> 00:21:59,640
Speaker 1: I know that's the point.

292
00:22:02,243 --> 00:22:03,596
Speaker 1: No one will want to come and slay me.

293
00:22:05,203 --> 00:22:08,352
Speaker 0: Okay, though I will say we often have debates among our group.

294
00:22:08,814 --> 00:22:13,022
Speaker 0: as to you know The question was always if there was evil power Would you take it?

295
00:22:13,464 --> 00:22:19,290
Speaker 0: and the fact that I said possibly means that I'm on Scott Johnson's bad list and if evil power ever appears He's gonna make sure.

296
00:22:19,311 --> 00:22:19,778
Speaker 0: I don't get it.

297
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,928
Speaker 1: I'm all about the evil power.

298
00:22:21,968 --> 00:22:24,060
Speaker 1: maybe cuz I would use the evil power for not evil.

299
00:22:24,442 --> 00:22:24,986
Speaker 0: It depends.

300
00:22:25,308 --> 00:22:26,899
Speaker 0: I could deal with being someone like Zellows.

301
00:22:27,661 --> 00:22:30,674
Speaker 0: Maybe I could deal with that real well, maybe anyway.

302
00:22:30,915 --> 00:22:35,975
Speaker 0: anyway tonight We are going to review a very good show that we both enjoyed very much.

303
00:22:35,995 --> 00:22:38,903
Speaker 0: It was also very popular Gundam seed.

304
00:22:39,184 --> 00:22:41,332
Speaker 1: we're not talking about Gundam see destiny God.

305
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:44,583
Speaker 0: Gundam see destiny does not exist Never seen it.

306
00:22:44,704 --> 00:22:48,013
Speaker 0: Imagine that I am Gundam see destiny's father.

307
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:54,276
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have no son Yeah, and now we're not gonna talk about Gundam seed manga.

308
00:22:54,316 --> 00:22:57,026
Speaker 1: We're not talking about Gundam seed movies.

309
00:22:57,267 --> 00:23:00,380
Speaker 1: We're not talking about Gundam seed OAVs or O and A's.

310
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:06,109
Speaker 1: We're talking about the original 50 episode TV series Gundam seed.

311
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:19,351
Speaker 0: it was put out by sunrise in late 2002. a Bandai Yeah, well in Japan, yeah, yeah, and it was directed by a Mitsuo Fukuda who is also known for gear fighter Dendo Which I've never seen and know nothing about.

312
00:23:19,372 --> 00:23:21,421
Speaker 1: he's basically some robot director I think.

313
00:23:21,843 --> 00:23:25,536
Speaker 0: apparently he put a lot of references to gear fighter Dendo in Gundam seed.

314
00:23:25,556 --> 00:23:26,278
Speaker 0: Yep.

315
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,613
Speaker 1: Yep That's apparently what the trivia and the anime news network encyclopedia says.

316
00:23:30,713 --> 00:23:30,914
Speaker 0: Yes.

317
00:23:30,974 --> 00:23:32,680
Speaker 0: That is also what I got out of Wikipedia.

318
00:23:34,644 --> 00:23:40,427
Speaker 1: It must be true if it's in two separate user editable Encyclopedia some information see.

319
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:43,800
Speaker 0: you'll note that we're very much trying to sound erudite like anime world order.

320
00:23:44,601 --> 00:23:46,811
Speaker 1: We're gonna fail miserably because we don't know shit about.

321
00:23:46,871 --> 00:23:52,679
Speaker 0: I just I just said what company put it out What year they put it out in and who directed it and something else he directed.

322
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,971
Speaker 0: Holy shit, that's more than we've ever done.

323
00:23:55,991 --> 00:23:56,694
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

324
00:23:56,714 --> 00:24:04,576
Speaker 0: I Mean when we talk about other shows were like, yeah this show came out I don't know ten years ago and then you look it up like now.

325
00:24:04,596 --> 00:24:05,300
Speaker 0: it came out last month.

326
00:24:05,601 --> 00:24:09,273
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the show came out in what 2000 late late 2002 to early 2003 and it was in the u.s.

327
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,159
Speaker 0: When Oh later, I don't know you watch the fan subs.

328
00:24:15,441 --> 00:24:16,829
Speaker 1: Yeah, I watched some of the fan subs.

329
00:24:16,849 --> 00:24:18,619
Speaker 1: then I stopped and then I bought it all on DVD.

330
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,568
Speaker 1: I think the DVDs must have come out 2004 2005.

331
00:24:20,568 --> 00:24:21,371
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

332
00:24:23,925 --> 00:24:25,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz we finished it last year.

333
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,747
Speaker 1: So at 2004 2005 is when the DVDs came out in the u.s.

334
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:37,057
Speaker 0: Now Gundam seed is notable for a number of reasons and that it breaks away from the previous Continuity of Gundam drastically.

335
00:24:37,077 --> 00:24:37,138
Speaker 0: Yes

336
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:55,460
Speaker 1: the original mobile suit Gundam takes place in a timeline called Universal Century and there there are a lot of Universal Century Gundams, I mean Zeta Gundams Universal Century Gundam Char's counter-attack All those things, you know that the original Gundam series

337
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,665
Speaker 0: Yeah, but not Gundam wing

338
00:24:56,866 --> 00:24:57,609
Speaker 1: not Gundam wing.

339
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,939
Speaker 1: Gundam wing is on its own in this other area.

340
00:25:03,943 --> 00:25:07,501
Speaker 1: Double o 80 double o 83 double 87 f 91.

341
00:25:07,501 --> 00:25:10,893
Speaker 1: Those are all Universal Century Gundam in the original universe.

342
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:12,760
Speaker 0: God f 91 was terrible.

343
00:25:12,941 --> 00:25:16,294
Speaker 1: yes, a Gundam wing was in its own universe.

344
00:25:16,495 --> 00:25:23,920
Speaker 1: with some manga and Gundam seed begins a new timeline of Gundam that's separate from all other Gundams called the cosmic era.

345
00:25:24,849 --> 00:25:29,938
Speaker 1: So Gundam seed and everything else Gundam seed related are all cosmic era Gundams.

346
00:25:30,199 --> 00:25:36,320
Speaker 0: now The interesting thing is that a lot of people have noticed that Gundam seed very much parallels the original Gundam.

347
00:25:36,585 --> 00:25:37,460
Speaker 1: Yes, it does like.

348
00:25:37,501 --> 00:25:46,507
Speaker 1: if you've seen the original Gundam, which I haven't just because I haven't gotten it and had the time to see it a Lot of it is pretty much.

349
00:25:46,648 --> 00:25:48,540
Speaker 1: Oh, it's the same thing only updated now.

350
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:55,660
Speaker 0: There are pros and cons to this because some fans said wow They took this awesome old show and they redid it modernly and now it's more awesome.

351
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:01,880
Speaker 0: But other fans said they have ruined the pure and transcendental nature of my robot anime.

352
00:26:02,181 --> 00:26:09,300
Speaker 1: Yep, well some other people said man the show would have been more awesome if I didn't spoil it for myself by watching original.

353
00:26:10,261 --> 00:26:15,878
Speaker 0: Yeah, I gotta say seeing Gundam seed without knowing how it's going to end is one of the primary reasons to watch it.

354
00:26:15,938 --> 00:26:29,240
Speaker 1: because yeah I mean if you've seen the original Gundam You're basically gonna easily predict a lot of things that go on and who's who and all sorts of secrets making the show Slightly less enjoyable even if you're not a fanboy.

355
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,760
Speaker 1: If you are a fanboy, you will not like Gundam seed if you've seen the original gun now.

356
00:26:32,881 --> 00:26:39,020
Speaker 0: Fortunately for most of you though I'm sure there are many people out there who will consider this a bad thing and I'm indifferent to the matter.

357
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:42,400
Speaker 0: I'll bet that the majority of anime fans have never seen the original Gundam.

358
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:45,769
Speaker 1: Also, I'm willing to bet that just because it's not easy to get.

359
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,852
Speaker 0: no really isn't.

360
00:26:47,113 --> 00:26:48,297
Speaker 1: it was easier to get.

361
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:48,839
Speaker 1: I'd have it.

362
00:26:49,622 --> 00:26:53,114
Speaker 1: You know, I mean, they're not selling it in $40 boxes at Otacon.

363
00:26:53,636 --> 00:26:54,840
Speaker 0: I think we could get it in Netflix.

364
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,543
Speaker 0: I haven't looked.

365
00:26:55,924 --> 00:26:56,828
Speaker 1: Oh, maybe we should try.

366
00:26:56,928 --> 00:27:00,585
Speaker 1: we should cuz I got probably something where even if it's not good We should.

367
00:27:00,605 --> 00:27:01,854
Speaker 1: you know, you're still like you should watch it.

368
00:27:01,934 --> 00:27:02,679
Speaker 1: Even if it's not good.

369
00:27:03,062 --> 00:27:04,832
Speaker 1: Yeah, just cuz it's the original Gundam.

370
00:27:04,912 --> 00:27:06,059
Speaker 1: every anime fan should see it.

371
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:17,254
Speaker 0: But anyway the plot of Gundam seed in case you haven't seen the original Gundam, which will assume that you all have Is the actual plot is somewhat simple and it's typical Gundam plot.

372
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:19,180
Speaker 0: There are people who live in space.

373
00:27:19,645 --> 00:27:20,757
Speaker 0: There are people who live on earth.

374
00:27:21,423 --> 00:27:28,440
Speaker 0: There is conflict between the people in space and the people on earth Kids and people who don't want to be involved in the war get involved in the war.

375
00:27:28,801 --> 00:27:33,133
Speaker 0: There's a whole bunch of crying and angst and shooting and in the end everything's kind of resolved.

376
00:27:33,634 --> 00:27:35,580
Speaker 1: Yep, that sums it up pretty good.

377
00:27:36,342 --> 00:27:38,228
Speaker 1: I mean to give a little more detail.

378
00:27:38,328 --> 00:27:40,094
Speaker 1: there are these people called zaft.

379
00:27:40,194 --> 00:27:45,640
Speaker 1: Well, I'll just say zaft They're coordinators and coordinators are like advanced super people.

380
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,980
Speaker 1: They're genetically engineered people who are smarter better faster stronger than everyone else.

381
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:55,356
Speaker 0: They're kind of like the people in a crest of the stars except not blue or more important.

382
00:27:55,376 --> 00:27:56,680
Speaker 0: They're kind of like the new types.

383
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,086
Speaker 1: Yes, that's exactly what in fact little bit of trivia.

384
00:27:59,527 --> 00:28:08,879
Speaker 0: new type magazine is called new type because that's what coordinators were called back in The day and those other guys in the Universal Century in those other Gundam shows, right?

385
00:28:10,613 --> 00:28:14,548
Speaker 1: and Everyone else is a human They or a robot.

386
00:28:14,911 --> 00:28:22,298
Speaker 1: you could be a robot also Or like a human clone or a robot clone or a coordinator clone and it was crazy.

387
00:28:22,338 --> 00:28:27,310
Speaker 1: but and These coordinators, you know were they basically?

388
00:28:27,551 --> 00:28:32,226
Speaker 1: they were discriminated against by a lot of humans, you know Because people are like that.

389
00:28:32,266 --> 00:28:36,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, particularly like the x-men if you think about it, particularly there's a group called what a blue cosmos.

390
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:39,751
Speaker 1: Yeah, blue cosmos are like the anti x-men.

391
00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:44,620
Speaker 0: they're the KKK only they're against Coordinators instead of you know, brown people.

392
00:28:44,642 --> 00:28:45,563
Speaker 1: Yeah It kind of it's.

393
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:53,100
Speaker 1: I don't know how that works out because if you're racist against someone who actually is Smarter better faster stronger wouldn't you just get your ass kick?

394
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,205
Speaker 0: See the problem is now.

395
00:28:55,265 --> 00:29:03,152
Speaker 0: I don't really want to go a lot into where coordinators came from but suffice to say the show starts Out and you know, oh there's coordinators and they just kind of go with it.

396
00:29:03,674 --> 00:29:13,343
Speaker 0: Don't worry later in the show There is old news things and flashbacks and you learn exactly the sci-fi business that is a coordinator and it's not just some hackney Plot point.

397
00:29:13,463 --> 00:29:17,080
Speaker 1: Yeah that I think that sci-fi business is actually a lot of the good part of the show.

398
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:23,584
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean there's a point where they go back and they kind of do this like news thing of and they have that fossil of The whale with wings.

399
00:29:23,886 --> 00:29:29,708
Speaker 1: Yeah proves this extraterrestrial life, which they don't talk about it so much But it has a really deep sci-fi meaning.

400
00:29:29,948 --> 00:29:42,532
Speaker 0: but suffice to say the while the show appears to be a typical gundam show There is a lot of very good sci-fi in there all over the place and it's not the focus of the show But pay attention to it because it adds so much.

401
00:29:42,653 --> 00:29:44,260
Speaker 0: without that the show would have been barely watchable.

402
00:29:44,481 --> 00:29:49,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean and we're not talking about just the you know robots fighting in space sci-fi action.

403
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:53,220
Speaker 1: We're talking about hard sci-fi like it's sort of between the lines.

404
00:29:53,401 --> 00:29:55,430
Speaker 1: But if you look you can see it there and it.

405
00:29:55,952 --> 00:29:57,760
Speaker 1: it makes everything else stand out pretty nicely.

406
00:29:57,942 --> 00:30:05,937
Speaker 0: Like when they go back and they explain, you know The first coordinator and what happened to him and his business and why all the people in space are mostly coordinators.

407
00:30:06,318 --> 00:30:07,924
Speaker 0: and yes They are better.

408
00:30:08,365 --> 00:30:11,116
Speaker 0: but because they're so good and so perfect.

409
00:30:11,156 --> 00:30:18,405
Speaker 0: They've been so engineered They can't breed so quickly and also living in space with limited resources Many of them don't want to breed.

410
00:30:18,766 --> 00:30:27,980
Speaker 0: so as a result while they are vastly superior both in technology and ability and intelligence There are just so many more humans and humans are on a planet.

411
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:34,280
Speaker 0: So they have such a more stable base of resources that the two forces are pretty much at a dead heat.

412
00:30:34,721 --> 00:30:42,972
Speaker 1: Yeah, and basically the plot is you know a long time ago the humans blew up But one of the space colony things of the coordinators.

413
00:30:43,033 --> 00:30:45,201
Speaker 1: Yes, which is sort of like the 9/11.

414
00:30:45,201 --> 00:30:47,212
Speaker 0: They mention it a lot in the show.

415
00:30:47,393 --> 00:30:48,740
Speaker 1: They mentioned in the opener, don't they?

416
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:54,179
Speaker 0: Yes, but later in the show, they actually explained specifically what happened and and a lot of bad stuff happens.

417
00:30:55,403 --> 00:30:58,160
Speaker 1: It's really important to understand the bloody valentine massacre.

418
00:30:58,401 --> 00:31:06,480
Speaker 0: It's basically this horrible tragedy where the earth forces used nuclear weapons to kill an insane amount of people in space.

419
00:31:06,661 --> 00:31:10,779
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was basically 9/11 for the coordinators, which is why they're at war.

420
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:20,064
Speaker 0: Yes And the core and the original conflict seems to be that the coordinators are fighting to make sure that they aren't effectively Genocided.

421
00:31:20,366 --> 00:31:27,640
Speaker 0: Yep, because that is what they are afraid of and the earth forces are Nominally fighting to protect themselves from the coordinators.

422
00:31:28,021 --> 00:31:33,340
Speaker 0: But there are a lot of elements in human society that are hijacking these military people.

423
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:39,040
Speaker 1: Well, that's that's really what the whole conflict is is that you have coordinators on one side saying let's kill all humans.

424
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,905
Speaker 1: You have humans saying kill all the coordinators.

425
00:31:41,226 --> 00:31:46,520
Speaker 1: then you have coordinators saying I just don't want to die by you crazy humans with nukes.

426
00:31:47,122 --> 00:31:52,560
Speaker 1: And you have humans saying I just don't want to feel threatened by these people who are smarter better faster and strong.

427
00:31:52,962 --> 00:32:04,748
Speaker 0: Think of it this way because this is a good way to put it in like modern-day realistic terms you have two Political factions that are also nations and they're at war now Officially and for all intents and purposes.

428
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:09,931
Speaker 0: they are at war because of these economic and social problems, you know They're afraid of each other.

429
00:32:10,032 --> 00:32:16,819
Speaker 0: There was this massacre Military buildup brinksmanship all of that and they're fighting as two powers fighting of you know a war.

430
00:32:17,841 --> 00:32:34,100
Speaker 0: But then the and this is really just the pretext because the reason they're really fighting is because there are a lot of coordinators who run the country who want to destroy all of the humans because they're inferior and take their land and There are a lot of humans who want to destroy all the coordinators because they're an abomination.

431
00:32:34,321 --> 00:32:40,217
Speaker 1: Generally all the people who were high up want to destroy the other guys and all the lowdown people don't.

432
00:32:40,378 --> 00:32:41,663
Speaker 1: I think it's set up That way.

433
00:32:41,964 --> 00:32:45,120
Speaker 1: however, it may not be a hundred percent realistic, but that's how it set up.

434
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:53,980
Speaker 0: Well, it seems that the like the in the earth forces There are nominally powerful people who they're the ones who are technically in power and technically running this war for all of their reasons.

435
00:32:54,101 --> 00:33:03,883
Speaker 0: but blue cosmos has kind of Infiltrated the government and blue cosmos represents the way a lot of people actually feel and they just justify the war with all of their Bullshit.

436
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:04,205
Speaker 0: Yep.

437
00:33:04,366 --> 00:33:04,627
Speaker 1: All right.

438
00:33:04,688 --> 00:33:07,786
Speaker 1: Now, let's let go with the robots a little bit Well before we get that that.

439
00:33:07,886 --> 00:33:13,031
Speaker 0: one of the other main points of conflict here is that Nuclear weapons were what was used to destroy this column.

440
00:33:13,131 --> 00:33:13,654
Speaker 1: Oh, right.

441
00:33:13,674 --> 00:33:15,020
Speaker 1: I forgot so it's huge.

442
00:33:15,381 --> 00:33:21,200
Speaker 0: So what the coordinators did with their vastly superior intelligence and science is they made end jammers.

443
00:33:21,441 --> 00:33:28,880
Speaker 0: Now an end jammer is a device that they don't explain in great detail But it is effectively a device that can prevent nuclear fission and fusion.

444
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,415
Speaker 0: Yeah

445
00:33:29,661 --> 00:33:30,028
Speaker 1: so in

446
00:33:30,048 --> 00:33:30,720
Speaker 0: a local space

447
00:33:31,123 --> 00:33:37,271
Speaker 1: What they did is they shot a bunch of giant things Into the deep deep deep into the earth where no one could dig like

448
00:33:37,311 --> 00:33:44,059
Speaker 0: thousands and thousands and thousands and the humans of it and the earth Forces have been trying to dig these things up and there's just so many they can't do it.

449
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,010
Speaker 1: Yes, so the basically no nuclear reactor will work.

450
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,635
Speaker 1: You can't have a nuclear submarine.

451
00:33:49,675 --> 00:33:59,584
Speaker 1: You can't have a nuclear-powered robot You can't have a nuclear missile and all the radios kind of suck anywhere near the earth because these end jammers are Preventing nukes from working

452
00:33:59,825 --> 00:34:05,020
Speaker 0: now as a side effect of you know, protecting the coordinators from the nukes and from the barbaric humans.

453
00:34:05,722 --> 00:34:11,540
Speaker 0: It also causes a lot of people on earth to die because suddenly there's no more nuclear power.

454
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:13,005
Speaker 0: There's an energy crisis.

455
00:34:13,306 --> 00:34:14,571
Speaker 0: mass chaos ensues.

456
00:34:14,831 --> 00:34:15,092
Speaker 1: Yep.

457
00:34:15,393 --> 00:34:17,060
Speaker 1: It's a whole bunch of stuff going on.

458
00:34:17,341 --> 00:34:23,639
Speaker 0: So both sides have perfectly legitimate gripes with each other, but then the actual reason they're fighting is just for this ideology.

459
00:34:24,001 --> 00:34:27,630
Speaker 1: Yep, so as I said, there's no nukes.

460
00:34:27,871 --> 00:34:29,415
Speaker 1: So the robots are kind of weak.

461
00:34:29,476 --> 00:34:31,080
Speaker 1: They can't have nuclear-powered robots.

462
00:34:31,744 --> 00:34:34,380
Speaker 0: No, yeah, despite all this there are neutral places.

463
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:42,668
Speaker 0: There's the nation of orb on earth Which is very technological and is comprised of a lot of coordinators and a lot of humans Yep, and there are outer space colonies that are neutral.

464
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:44,275
Speaker 1: Yeah, which is where the story begins?

465
00:34:44,335 --> 00:34:50,393
Speaker 1: the story begins in Heliopolis Which is a outer space colony and what's happening is the ZAF.

466
00:34:50,454 --> 00:34:51,577
Speaker 1: people have robots.

467
00:34:51,658 --> 00:34:52,982
Speaker 1: they have Gundams.

468
00:34:53,083 --> 00:35:04,880
Speaker 1: well not Gundams but mobile suits and that's a extreme advantage in the war Compared to the mobile armors, which are basically x-wing type devices, you know or flying little space jet guys.

469
00:35:05,141 --> 00:35:11,423
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's pretty much as far as I can tell only one human who can actually fly one of these things effectively in his name Is moolah flaga.

470
00:35:11,563 --> 00:35:17,499
Speaker 1: moolah flaga is the best character in the show, but the point is I don't know I'll have to raise you a lock is Klein?

471
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:24,288
Speaker 1: Yeah The only advantage the humans have in this war is their numbers and if they could somehow get mobile suits They could turn the tide,

472
00:35:24,551 --> 00:35:30,900
Speaker 0: you know in D&D terms It's a lot like the orcs versus the humans or the humans versus the elves or the elves versus the drag.

473
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,132
Speaker 1: Well, it's like battle take with the clan versus the inner sphere.

474
00:35:33,272 --> 00:35:34,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's exactly like that.

475
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:52,435
Speaker 1: So the story begins on this space colony where Orb or the military like factory of orb, which is called Morgan Ray D Is developing some robots that will be able to be piloted by humans.

476
00:35:52,475 --> 00:35:53,920
Speaker 1: They're also badass robots.

477
00:35:54,181 --> 00:36:04,199
Speaker 0: See the reason humans don't have mobile suits is that humans just don't have the physical agility and the mental power To be able to pilot one of these incredibly complex things.

478
00:36:04,782 --> 00:36:08,735
Speaker 0: But coordinators because of their massively augmented intelligence have absolutely no problem.

479
00:36:09,077 --> 00:36:10,080
Speaker 1: Well, they don't have no problem.

480
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,207
Speaker 1: Well, no, they did they can do it.

481
00:36:11,247 --> 00:36:11,851
Speaker 0: They can do it.

482
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:13,420
Speaker 0: It is not an impossibility.

483
00:36:13,741 --> 00:36:14,805
Speaker 1: No, it's not not at all.

484
00:36:15,146 --> 00:36:22,358
Speaker 1: But for humans, it's basically just beyond human ability, you know It's like maybe the best human there is could kind of do it.

485
00:36:22,398 --> 00:36:25,358
Speaker 1: shit Lee Yeah, but a really good coordinator could do it awesomely.

486
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:34,507
Speaker 0: so now the story starts in Heliopolis and it follows a whole bunch of kids and I'll warn you that the first about three or Four episodes are Typical Gundam opening crap.

487
00:36:34,628 --> 00:36:39,284
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like you can't really see where the show is going because what it is is Oh, there's.

488
00:36:39,485 --> 00:36:43,420
Speaker 1: they were making robots, you know, which on a neutral area where they shouldn't have been.

489
00:36:43,641 --> 00:36:44,143
Speaker 0: Oh, does that?

490
00:36:44,344 --> 00:36:45,128
Speaker 0: Oh figured it out?

491
00:36:45,188 --> 00:36:46,294
Speaker 0: is that people figured out.

492
00:36:46,314 --> 00:36:47,520
Speaker 1: they're coming to take the robots.

493
00:36:47,982 --> 00:36:51,520
Speaker 1: There's some kids who accidentally get involved with the robot.

494
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:55,980
Speaker 0: You know, at least that makes sense because they're like at University and high school and studying this stuff.

495
00:36:56,241 --> 00:37:00,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know, oh some kids some you know, it's neutral.

496
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:09,278
Speaker 1: so some of them are coordinators some of them are and you know in there they get the robot and they get in a Spaceship and all of a sudden they're in the military and then the story begins.

497
00:37:09,659 --> 00:37:16,400
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean that it's they're such a pretext to get these people into the story that the first few episodes are kind of rushed in.

498
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:19,711
Speaker 0: That it goes from we're kids - oh my god.

499
00:37:19,751 --> 00:37:21,135
Speaker 0: that kids piloting the robot.

500
00:37:21,216 --> 00:37:21,737
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

501
00:37:21,777 --> 00:37:22,560
Speaker 0: He's a coordinator.

502
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,624
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh my god.

503
00:37:23,664 --> 00:37:24,206
Speaker 0: He saved us.

504
00:37:24,366 --> 00:37:25,450
Speaker 0: Oh my god around the ship.

505
00:37:25,992 --> 00:37:28,320
Speaker 0: Oh my god, the Heliopolis exploded.

506
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:34,218
Speaker 1: yeah, I think what it is is, you know, they design characters and that they want, you know to appeal to the audience.

507
00:37:34,539 --> 00:37:38,454
Speaker 1: and then They make a plot and those characters don't fit into the plots.

508
00:37:38,494 --> 00:37:39,900
Speaker 1: They need to have this beginning part.

509
00:37:40,121 --> 00:37:45,911
Speaker 1: That's a little bit hackneyed to you know, mix the two together now or else you would go What the hell are they doing there?

510
00:37:45,952 --> 00:37:46,659
Speaker 1: That makes no sense.

511
00:37:47,420 --> 00:38:00,406
Speaker 0: don't discount the show based on the first four maybe five episodes because once the characters are set once they're in the ship and The plot starts going the show is Incredibly well done.

512
00:38:00,808 --> 00:38:12,280
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I mean at least compared to other Gundams I've seen and a lot of other robot shows in general, you know It's just fantastic because they don't concentrate so much on the robot stuff.

513
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:16,740
Speaker 1: I mean, it's there and you know, they say lots of spaceship be robot stuff.

514
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:23,600
Speaker 0: Yes, they're definitely nods to the fanboys in that I mean, there's the robot fighting which is well done, but it's not repetitive.

515
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:34,906
Speaker 1: It's sometimes it's repetitive when they use they reuse some footage over and like yeah A fight will happen at the end of an episode and the beginning of the next episode will show you the same Animation from the end of the last one.

516
00:38:35,248 --> 00:38:38,800
Speaker 1: so it kind of it's a little eh if you're watching it straight through on DVDs.

517
00:38:39,001 --> 00:38:41,839
Speaker 1: But if you watch the episode spaced out, it's all good.

518
00:38:42,382 --> 00:38:44,109
Speaker 0: But they do the thing of they.

519
00:38:44,571 --> 00:38:49,540
Speaker 0: I mean the fanboys really want all the technical stuff Like they want to hear like a bunch of made-up technology.

520
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:57,016
Speaker 0: They want to hear what formation the Gundams are in or what gun they're firing or what part of the ship just got damaged or what the rank is of that officer.

521
00:38:57,137 --> 00:39:04,704
Speaker 0: and The beauty of the way Gundam seed is pulled off is that all of that is there but it doesn't get in the way They don't.

522
00:39:04,724 --> 00:39:11,018
Speaker 0: they don't bother explaining like this extra lung Whatever gun is this kind of weapon, but this gun does this thing?

523
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,122
Speaker 0: Yeah, this gun does.

524
00:39:12,182 --> 00:39:15,960
Speaker 1: all that stuff is explained in the DVD extras and stuff if you want to read it.

525
00:39:16,683 --> 00:39:26,140
Speaker 0: But more importantly in the show the captain or the XO will just order, you know Buyer the blah blah blah and it just happens and the fanboys can figure it out and drool about it.

526
00:39:26,701 --> 00:39:32,060
Speaker 0: But all it does to people who don't care about that is add authenticity that yeah, they're using military jargon and it works.

527
00:39:32,502 --> 00:39:41,787
Speaker 1: Yep, it's like, you know at the other robot shows What they'll do is they'll explain what every single thing is and it's like these people are in the military Shouldn't they already know?

528
00:39:42,249 --> 00:39:42,571
Speaker 1: it's like.

529
00:39:42,632 --> 00:39:43,759
Speaker 1: why are they explaining it to?

530
00:39:43,819 --> 00:39:44,000
Speaker 1: you know?

531
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,522
Speaker 1: It's like they're.

532
00:39:44,923 --> 00:39:48,416
Speaker 1: you realize that it's only there for the audience and it kind of ruins the show a bit.

533
00:39:48,737 --> 00:39:49,945
Speaker 1: and Gundam see they don't bother.

534
00:39:50,005 --> 00:39:54,180
Speaker 1: people know what they're supposed to do and You know if there's any fancy words.

535
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,228
Speaker 1: They just say the fancy words without defining them.

536
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:04,880
Speaker 0: now the primary conflict of the plot of the show The overarching plot is this conflict between zaft and earth and the neutral territories like orb.

537
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:06,739
Speaker 1: But the story doesn't focus on that.

538
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,768
Speaker 1: I mean it does but it's sort of like.

539
00:40:08,849 --> 00:40:11,440
Speaker 1: that's like the environment in which the story takes place.

540
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:16,227
Speaker 0: And now that alone would have been an okay show, okay So but what they did is they they took.

541
00:40:16,689 --> 00:40:20,600
Speaker 0: basically I don't want to trivialize it, but it was effectively teen angst.

542
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:26,500
Speaker 0: It's a teen angst soap opera in space, but at least it's a well done teen angst soap opera.

543
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:36,480
Speaker 1: Well, the teen angst soap opera has different phases and different segments, you know It's like certain characters have certain conflicts which all seem to all tie into the main character Kira Yamato somehow.

544
00:40:37,123 --> 00:40:43,791
Speaker 1: But some of them are annoying like early on all the stuff with Flay, it's really just flay is annoying.

545
00:40:43,851 --> 00:40:46,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, flay all-star is annoying, but that's important.

546
00:40:46,301 --> 00:40:48,760
Speaker 0: I don't want to ruin anything, but it's important that she's annoying.

547
00:40:48,981 --> 00:40:52,898
Speaker 1: It is important that she's annoying but she's there and that's annoying.

548
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:59,687
Speaker 1: teen angst But all the other teen angst is pretty good, you know, it's like oh we used to be friends And now we're on opposite sides of the war.

549
00:40:59,888 --> 00:41:02,257
Speaker 1: or oh no so-and-so died.

550
00:41:02,357 --> 00:41:03,000
Speaker 1: I crying.

551
00:41:04,143 --> 00:41:06,819
Speaker 1: Why you know should I stay in the military or should I go?

552
00:41:07,442 --> 00:41:15,528
Speaker 0: the characters are really in my opinion, especially for a show like this very realistically portrayed and Very multi-dimensional in many cases.

553
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:18,179
Speaker 0: I mean no character is just straight-up.

554
00:41:18,761 --> 00:41:23,280
Speaker 0: I am the angsty guy who doesn't want to pilot the robot or I am the strong woman who will stand here.

555
00:41:23,741 --> 00:41:25,768
Speaker 0: Everyone who is strong is moments of weakness.

556
00:41:26,089 --> 00:41:27,815
Speaker 0: Everyone who is weak has moments of strength.

557
00:41:28,096 --> 00:41:29,080
Speaker 0: The show is very human.

558
00:41:29,401 --> 00:41:30,685
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's another thing.

559
00:41:30,725 --> 00:41:40,380
Speaker 1: I really like about the show is that you know, there are a lot of characters a lot But somehow you can keep track of all them pretty easily because the designs are really recognizable.

560
00:41:40,621 --> 00:41:43,691
Speaker 0: I mean even characters that die, I mean characters die.

561
00:41:43,771 --> 00:41:44,855
Speaker 0: The show is not all.

562
00:41:44,895 --> 00:41:45,577
Speaker 0: there's a guy.

563
00:41:45,617 --> 00:41:46,420
Speaker 1: This isn't a spoiler.

564
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,435
Speaker 1: There's a guy named rusty.

565
00:41:48,681 --> 00:41:51,554
Speaker 1: Rusty dies in like episode one or two.

566
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:53,040
Speaker 0: You never see his face.

567
00:41:53,401 --> 00:41:55,007
Speaker 0: all you see is him getting shot.

568
00:41:55,228 --> 00:42:04,080
Speaker 1: and then another guy who is a very like a main main character goes Rusty and you hear Rusty's name later when they're remembering people who died.

569
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:13,579
Speaker 0: He's like rusty and it's like it's the great, you know at the end of this episode when we're done talking about the show Seriously, we're gonna go through all of the funny cliches in the show.

570
00:42:13,861 --> 00:42:15,185
Speaker 0: Okay, because there are many.

571
00:42:15,506 --> 00:42:16,088
Speaker 1: there are many.

572
00:42:16,148 --> 00:42:25,060
Speaker 1: but another thing what I'm saying is there are a lot of characters in the show Who may or may not have names and they may or may not get a lot of screen time.

573
00:42:25,622 --> 00:42:28,212
Speaker 1: But they're not in other shows.

574
00:42:28,272 --> 00:42:29,437
Speaker 1: they would just be extras.

575
00:42:29,477 --> 00:42:36,145
Speaker 1: but in this show There's something a little bit like the guy who's the maintenance guy and the robots You know in on the ship.

576
00:42:36,366 --> 00:42:40,780
Speaker 0: if a character has a line ever they are fleshed out as much as they can be.

577
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:45,743
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like the guy who is the navigator on the ship, you know, you you don't even get his name Really?

578
00:42:45,784 --> 00:42:47,539
Speaker 1: I think maybe you do once or twice, you know.

579
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:52,700
Speaker 1: But while he doesn't say a lot you see him there and you keep seeing the same guy.

580
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:57,960
Speaker 1: They draw the same guy in the same seat and they have him show up at appropriate times and say appropriate things.

581
00:42:58,302 --> 00:43:04,035
Speaker 1: So you kind of get to know him even though he's not involved in the main plot in any way Except for he's a guy who's there.

582
00:43:04,055 --> 00:43:04,700
Speaker 1: He's the navigator.

583
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:10,380
Speaker 0: Well a lot of shows when they do something like that They'll just draw a generic guy like a faceless guy in the background working on the robot.

584
00:43:10,641 --> 00:43:24,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, and not only that but whenever like whenever something happens and people are around There'll be a lot of reaction shots and a lot of the reaction shots are of characters You don't know just like the crowd of officers standing there just kind of watching something happen.

585
00:43:25,461 --> 00:43:36,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, you know, they'll have like a a council or like a military tribunal And you'll know like the two head guys of the tribunal and you've never seen the other eight care You've never seen the other eight guys.

586
00:43:36,961 --> 00:43:46,260
Speaker 1: But instead of just having the main two guys talk while the other eight guys sit there They'll have some of those other eight guys say like one line each so that they're actually not just extra fact.

587
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,432
Speaker 0: I think I remember one point at which there is a scene where there were two character.

588
00:43:49,673 --> 00:43:57,120
Speaker 0: two of the people arguing were neither of Which were characters I knew in any way Yeah, and yet it was their scene and the characters I knew we're just kind of watching

589
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:04,400
Speaker 1: Yeah And they have no qualms about just introducing characters and taking them out and putting them back in and all kinds of stuff.

590
00:44:04,481 --> 00:44:08,004
Speaker 1: Yeah, you really can't skip around in the show You gotta watch it straight through.

591
00:44:08,044 --> 00:44:20,540
Speaker 0: like there's a point at which because the basic driving force of the show in terms of plot As opposed to character is that all of the characters are on this ship the legged ship and They're on their archangel.

592
00:44:20,582 --> 00:44:28,319
Speaker 0: Yeah they're in this ship on their own and a Somewhat elite force of zapped and is trying to track them down.

593
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:37,800
Speaker 0: it's like the first half of the show in addition to the war going on and They're just trapped alone trying to avoid being killed and that's the whole first half of the show.

594
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,135
Speaker 0: They're just trying to get somewhere safe and that's really hard to do.

595
00:44:41,155 --> 00:44:42,260
Speaker 1: Well, they're trying to get back to earth.

596
00:44:42,661 --> 00:44:45,331
Speaker 0: Well, they're trying to get somewhere safe, but we know how that ends.

597
00:44:45,492 --> 00:44:45,753
Speaker 0: Yeah.

598
00:44:45,994 --> 00:44:47,098
Speaker 0: Remember when they go to Artemis?

599
00:44:47,318 --> 00:44:54,920
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, they were just trying to get somewhere safe and no no good But the driving can't go somewhere safe then there wouldn't be any robot battles.

600
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,289
Speaker 1: What's wrong with the driving force?

601
00:44:56,309 --> 00:44:57,818
Speaker 0: character wise is that?

602
00:44:57,919 --> 00:45:05,686
Speaker 0: I mean I'd say the primary conflict is that the two characters that are main ish are Kira Yamato and Othran of Zale Zala.

603
00:45:05,747 --> 00:45:20,240
Speaker 1: they mess it up because like if you buy a toy that has Othran's name on it It says A S U R A N, which is Asudan, but in like the fans in the bandai subtitles It says A T H R U N Othran, you know.

604
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:24,220
Speaker 1: And then like some places get the R and the L mixed up in the last name.

605
00:45:24,461 --> 00:45:30,180
Speaker 1: I'm not sure which one it is, but it's either Z A R A or Z A L A but either way it's Zara.

606
00:45:30,601 --> 00:46:05,540
Speaker 0: Anyway, they're both coordinators and Othran is a member of the military of this elite force for Zaft and Kira Yamato ends up even though he's a coordinator Piloting this one Gundam that they've got on this ship and all he's trying to do is defend all of his friends and it ends Up that Othran is sent to kill the people on the ship and then he finds out that Kira's on there and the whole show Is these two, you know meeting in the midst of combat or you know Just crossing in the wind and trying to deal with that the fact that they're both on opposite sides of a war.

607
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:05,861
Speaker 0: Yeah,

608
00:46:05,941 --> 00:46:25,654
Speaker 1: it's like if rim was an Iranian soldier and I was a US soldier and there was a US-Iranian war and I was on a boat with the rest of the front row crew and I was the robot pilot and rim was also a robot pilot and he Was coming to blow up the boat and I'd be like you're my you're my friend and I don't want to kill you but I have like ten friends on this boat and I have to defend them from you.

609
00:46:25,975 --> 00:46:26,899
Speaker 1: who is going to kill them?

610
00:46:26,919 --> 00:46:29,004
Speaker 0: and If you think that's it.

611
00:46:29,105 --> 00:46:30,269
Speaker 0: No, there is.

612
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:33,140
Speaker 0: so every character drives the plot in some way.

613
00:46:33,561 --> 00:46:36,490
Speaker 0: I mean every character has their moment everything.

614
00:46:37,313 --> 00:46:40,887
Speaker 0: the character relationships are very complex Very complex.

615
00:46:41,169 --> 00:46:43,301
Speaker 0: I'm not going to ruin anything other than that They.

616
00:46:44,023 --> 00:46:50,025
Speaker 0: this show is comprised of many very powerful scenes that are very obviously Important.

617
00:46:50,066 --> 00:46:50,509
Speaker 0: scenes like.

618
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:51,780
Speaker 0: the show will be going fine.

619
00:46:52,602 --> 00:46:57,137
Speaker 0: And then you know some musical start and there will be a scene like a 10-minute scene.

620
00:46:57,438 --> 00:47:05,240
Speaker 0: Yep, and Like there's the Opera House scene, there's the scene where two characters are standing on opposite sides of a fence outside.

621
00:47:07,501 --> 00:47:12,016
Speaker 1: That was also lots of symbolism like they'll put little tiny things like.

622
00:47:12,236 --> 00:47:19,777
Speaker 1: Kira has this bird That you know Asuran made for him a long time ago before the show started and they'll have the bird kind

623
00:47:19,797 --> 00:47:20,920
Speaker 0: of like Darth Vader

624
00:47:21,142 --> 00:47:30,160
Speaker 1: kind of like Darth Vader and You know, they'll have this bird show up and land on people's shoulders or fly into different scenes.

625
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:38,952
Speaker 1: You know to like remind you and teach you that, you know and remind you of things and be symbolic, you know, and they'll have Lacas Klein who's Asuran's woman.

626
00:47:39,153 --> 00:47:41,562
Speaker 0: Lacas Klein is Awesome.

627
00:47:41,703 --> 00:47:45,879
Speaker 1: Yeah is rims favorite character, you know, she has these little Haros which you might notice.

628
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,808
Speaker 1: there There's a lot of toys of these.

629
00:47:47,868 --> 00:47:50,118
Speaker 1: they're little balls with the wings and the eyeballs.

630
00:47:50,138 --> 00:47:50,500
Speaker 1: They're cute.

631
00:47:50,641 --> 00:47:54,820
Speaker 0: I got a little auto washcloth in a little Haro bag for Emily.

632
00:47:54,940 --> 00:48:05,620
Speaker 1: yeah, these things will bounce around and say cute things and and generally interfere in scenes to say things that are Poignant or silly, you know, yes often very poignant though.

633
00:48:06,012 --> 00:48:19,176
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like, you know They just throw little things into every scene to remind you of stuff and and be symbolic all over the place Or they'll show you images of things like that whale with the wings, you know to remind you.

634
00:48:19,237 --> 00:48:20,200
Speaker 0: and now there is.

635
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:37,666
Speaker 0: There's a lot of romance among the interpersonal relationships of the characters and without ruining anything because there's a lot to ruin I would just like to point out that all of the relationships are very realistically handled and They aren't used Too badly for the plot.

636
00:48:37,687 --> 00:48:42,059
Speaker 0: like characters don't get together and then the whole plot result revolves around it.

637
00:48:42,621 --> 00:48:47,498
Speaker 0: things just kind of occur naturally and you really a lot of things that you expect to happen don't.

638
00:48:47,999 --> 00:48:58,553
Speaker 0: and Characters that you wouldn't think would have any reason to know each other end up getting together and It's hard to predict what the show is going to do unless you watch the openers carefully.

639
00:48:59,155 --> 00:49:01,782
Speaker 1: Yeah a lot of it though You know.

640
00:49:01,822 --> 00:49:04,211
Speaker 1: what happens is all the relationship.

641
00:49:04,231 --> 00:49:09,216
Speaker 1: stuff goes like unspoken, you know, yeah Yeah, it's like no one will say hey, you're hot.

642
00:49:09,256 --> 00:49:09,880
Speaker 1: Hey, I want you.

643
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:14,740
Speaker 1: Hey, you know me and him are going out me and them or you know, it's all just kind of you know.

644
00:49:14,901 --> 00:49:17,980
Speaker 1: You'll get a shot on someone's face and a shot on someone else's face.

645
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:26,579
Speaker 1: Then they'll show you two people looking at each other, you know or they'll show you like two people waking up in the same room and everything is sort of implied.

646
00:49:26,599 --> 00:49:32,618
Speaker 1: and You know at first when I watched the show the first time I was always kind of like, huh?

647
00:49:33,921 --> 00:49:35,108
Speaker 1: Is it really going on?

648
00:49:35,148 --> 00:49:37,380
Speaker 1: because they don't you know, they never put it in concrete.

649
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,764
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, you're not.

650
00:49:38,905 --> 00:49:43,580
Speaker 1: I wasn't a hundred percent sure just how involved until a few scenes in the end where?

651
00:49:44,302 --> 00:49:46,227
Speaker 0: Some very obvious things happen.

652
00:49:46,407 --> 00:49:46,748
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

653
00:49:46,768 --> 00:49:46,949
Speaker 1: Yeah.

654
00:49:47,009 --> 00:49:47,189
Speaker 1: Yeah.

655
00:49:47,209 --> 00:49:51,300
Speaker 1: Yeah there there there are very obvious things towards the end and in the openers.

656
00:49:51,602 --> 00:49:53,760
Speaker 1: That's another problem is the openers are very spoilery.

657
00:49:53,844 --> 00:49:55,209
Speaker 1: Yeah Take them at face value.

658
00:49:55,350 --> 00:50:03,606
Speaker 0: watch the openers because they're good but don't think about them because I kept pissing Scott off while we were watching the show because he'd seen a Much of it and I hadn't.

659
00:50:03,908 --> 00:50:08,939
Speaker 0: and as we're watching like I'd noticed in one opener Two characters are on opposite sides of the screen pointing guns at each other.

660
00:50:09,602 --> 00:50:12,432
Speaker 0: So I'm like, alright those two characters are gonna fight each other somehow.

661
00:50:13,014 --> 00:50:13,476
Speaker 0: and he's like.

662
00:50:13,817 --> 00:50:14,339
Speaker 0: and then they did.

663
00:50:14,881 --> 00:50:22,880
Speaker 0: But then the opener changed one episode and the same two characters are in the same poses But instead of coming across the screen aiming at each other.

664
00:50:23,321 --> 00:50:33,799
Speaker 0: They come across the screen backwards and they end up standing back-to-back and I said, holy crap That got one of those characters is gonna join the other character side and they're gonna be allies and scouts like what the fuck.

665
00:50:34,666 --> 00:50:35,860
Speaker 0: And I said it's all in the opener.

666
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:41,502
Speaker 0: Look the opener shows me that those two characters gonna get together that carriage is gonna die that carries gonna do this and it was All right.

667
00:50:41,803 --> 00:50:46,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if you don't pay too much attention the opener you might spoil the show for yourself.

668
00:50:46,902 --> 00:50:54,232
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you if you think you're smart don't watch the openers Even though you should listen to the awesome awesome music in the opener.

669
00:50:54,292 --> 00:50:54,513
Speaker 0: Yes.

670
00:50:54,553 --> 00:50:56,700
Speaker 0: The music in this show is very good.

671
00:50:56,961 --> 00:51:01,357
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like they got all this great TM revolution music and what's the?

672
00:51:01,377 --> 00:51:01,920
Speaker 1: what's her name?

673
00:51:02,782 --> 00:51:21,540
Speaker 1: They got TM revolution and Nami Tamaki and all these other people to do awesome openers and closers and Awesome, like this, you know original orchestral score During the show and it's wicked awesome music is used to very great effect to augment your emotions.

674
00:51:21,721 --> 00:51:32,960
Speaker 0: I mean, there'll be a scene and the scene itself would have been heart-wrenching or Incredibly full of just like fair and anticipation and then the music just kind of drives that home doubly.

675
00:51:33,656 --> 00:51:40,711
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like what they'll do is they'll have the same music for the same things that happen because there are things that happen often and repeat Oh,

676
00:51:40,753 --> 00:51:45,118
Speaker 0: yeah They're kind of like leitmotifs like certain characters will have certain songs that play when they come or so

677
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:47,629
Speaker 1: It's like if so and so is sad.

678
00:51:47,709 --> 00:51:49,558
Speaker 1: and they're dealing with this section of the.

679
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:52,071
Speaker 1: you know The overall plot like this relationship.

680
00:51:52,433 --> 00:51:53,600
Speaker 1: you'll always hear that music.

681
00:51:54,288 --> 00:52:04,359
Speaker 0: But but as a result They also use the music to kind of show characters emotions in ways that you couldn't show so easily just by animating Especially since so much of it is left unsaid if people just look at each other.

682
00:52:04,841 --> 00:52:08,675
Speaker 1: so a lot of it is people look at each other and they play a music to let you know

683
00:52:08,976 --> 00:52:19,020
Speaker 0: or like a character standing somewhere and His eyes narrow and suddenly some music comes in and the music kind of shows you his resolve growing as he's about to shoot someone.

684
00:52:19,342 --> 00:52:22,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, and changing that music would just completely change the whole thing.

685
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:27,539
Speaker 1: You know, it's like the animation isn't so much the music is what really does it?

686
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:34,320
Speaker 0: I mean all in all because I don't want to go too long about this and yeah We've been dancing around spoiler lines a lot.

687
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,015
Speaker 0: We're going to at some point in the future do a final thoughts episode on Gundam.

688
00:52:38,035 --> 00:52:40,440
Speaker 0: see but this is just a review So we're not going to spoil anything.

689
00:52:40,801 --> 00:52:42,807
Speaker 1: The point is that Gundam seed is a really good show.

690
00:52:43,108 --> 00:52:56,096
Speaker 0: now if you think you wouldn't like Gundam seed because you don't like Gundam Shows you don't like robot shows Gundam seed is Probably the perfect robot show for you because there is so much more to it than the robot.

691
00:52:56,196 --> 00:52:59,299
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's soap opera It's a sci-fi and it's robot.

692
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,586
Speaker 0: It's not like Ava or Big O where it's.

693
00:53:02,188 --> 00:53:06,820
Speaker 0: hey, the robots are just here to get you to think about this existentialist crisis.

694
00:53:07,302 --> 00:53:09,911
Speaker 1: Yeah here look at the genres listed on anime news network.

695
00:53:10,092 --> 00:53:17,126
Speaker 1: Drama is mecha military romance science fiction shonen That's that's quite a bit there.

696
00:53:17,387 --> 00:53:20,640
Speaker 0: All right, so on to the funny cliches in this show.

697
00:53:21,181 --> 00:53:23,087
Speaker 1: The first one is the split screen.

698
00:53:23,508 --> 00:53:25,012
Speaker 1: It's not just the split screen.

699
00:53:25,272 --> 00:53:28,020
Speaker 1: the I'd like to call it the breaking glass screen.

700
00:53:28,181 --> 00:53:30,580
Speaker 1: You know when you break a piece of glass it gets a bunch of triangles.

701
00:53:30,961 --> 00:53:35,660
Speaker 1: Yep, what they'll do in this show is like something will explode in a space battle.

702
00:53:35,841 --> 00:53:47,659
Speaker 1: Maybe someone dies, you know, and then what they'll do is they'll break the screen up into you know Like rhombuses and triangles and they'll show you the faces of a different character in each spot.

703
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:54,914
Speaker 1: So big You'll get like a one-second reaction from each character.

704
00:53:55,556 --> 00:53:56,440
Speaker 0: now it starts out alright.

705
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,070
Speaker 0: I mean a lot of shows do something like that.

706
00:53:58,452 --> 00:54:05,060
Speaker 0: and because there aren't so many characters Towards the end of the show when pretty much all the characters were still alive are involved in scenes

707
00:54:05,323 --> 00:54:06,800
Speaker 1: They're involved in one giant space

708
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:13,411
Speaker 0: And Then a whole new Swipe and then a whole nother set of people reacting to something and

709
00:54:13,451 --> 00:54:19,842
Speaker 1: then the person who cares the most about what just happened We'll get a full screen, you know scream going on, you know It's.

710
00:54:20,264 --> 00:54:24,300
Speaker 1: they got to show you the reaction of every single character for like a fraction of a second.

711
00:54:24,602 --> 00:54:26,915
Speaker 1: So they break the screen up and show you everyone's face.

712
00:54:26,935 --> 00:54:27,840
Speaker 0: It works really well.

713
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:37,089
Speaker 0: But if you watch the show pretty much straight through like we did you really start to notice that that happens all the time And you start laughing even though it's a serious scene.

714
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:40,058
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like if you had a Gundam seed drinking game, it's like oh man.

715
00:54:41,782 --> 00:54:51,060
Speaker 1: Another thing that's a problem I think with Gundam seed is that there are a lot of recap episodes Which if you're watching it on TV, or let's say you're picking it up in the middle.

716
00:54:51,281 --> 00:54:59,864
Speaker 1: That's a great thing because the recap episodes There's many of them and they're thorough and they actually have a little bit of new stuff and they kind of make sense in the plot And they're interesting.

717
00:54:59,904 --> 00:55:01,574
Speaker 1: It's not just like here's a recap.

718
00:55:01,635 --> 00:55:08,339
Speaker 1: It's like but god It's like we're gonna do it military debriefing and they you know, they talk they speak and there's a recap.

719
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:16,569
Speaker 0: now I wouldn't mind except that there seem to be about twice as many recaps as there need to be and Some shows do recaps really well like Nana.

720
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:26,187
Speaker 0: the recaps are totally new episodes effectively Yeah, because they show you the same thing for different perspective and they add things and it's really worth it to watch Gundam seed the recaps.

721
00:55:26,247 --> 00:55:27,653
Speaker 0: I just feel cheated like damn it.

722
00:55:27,673 --> 00:55:29,380
Speaker 0: They just stole 15 minutes of my life.

723
00:55:29,721 --> 00:56:00,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you're watching on the DVDs straight through you can pretty much skip the recap episodes or at least fast-forward them to see like The 10 seconds of new animation, but if you're watching slowly, you know over time I think the recaps would help you a lot because you'd forget details that you know are important later on or You maybe missed an episode here or there but even then if you watch it say one episode a week There's still too many recaps, you know, they could have cut out one or two of them and been okay.

724
00:56:01,062 --> 00:56:06,789
Speaker 1: All right, especially since the recaps often come right before very important episodes So they just delay.

725
00:56:06,829 --> 00:56:08,803
Speaker 1: you get into the good stuff now.

726
00:56:08,843 --> 00:56:16,346
Speaker 0: the other big thing that happens often is Kira Yamato starts crying or Another character cries.

727
00:56:16,487 --> 00:56:25,380
Speaker 0: a lot of people cry a lot in this show And the thing is normally when you have a voice actor doing crying it sounds like a voice actor doing crying.

728
00:56:25,681 --> 00:56:32,500
Speaker 0: You know, it's just someone doing like a movie crying and for whatever reason and I'm actually very glad they did it this way.

729
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,219
Speaker 0: But it's also sometimes hilarious.

730
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:43,568
Speaker 0: Characters cry realistically because if you've ever seen someone crying after something absolutely terrible happens to them They don't cry like people cry in the movies.

731
00:56:43,969 --> 00:56:49,367
Speaker 0: These people cry in like these horrible moaning like Gasping sounds it's.

732
00:56:49,588 --> 00:56:52,036
Speaker 1: it's actually pretty painful to listen to.

733
00:56:52,177 --> 00:56:55,620
Speaker 1: it's like oh Make it stop just stop making those noises.

734
00:56:56,243 --> 00:57:03,075
Speaker 0: The worst is Kira cries a lot and they even make fun of him for it like they call him a crybaby at one point seriously, like it's a good scene, but they mentioned.

735
00:57:03,096 --> 00:57:15,898
Speaker 0: he's a crybaby, but one character at one point for various reasons a character tries to pilot a robot that that character shouldn't have tried to pilot and It the scene ends with that character crying and it's kind of this.

736
00:57:19,822 --> 00:57:20,767
Speaker 0: It's the worst thing ever.

737
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:22,478
Speaker 1: it's really really bad.

738
00:57:22,498 --> 00:57:25,025
Speaker 0: like I Felt I almost wanted to vomit.

739
00:57:25,045 --> 00:57:25,908
Speaker 0: It was so terrible.

740
00:57:25,948 --> 00:57:29,480
Speaker 0: I felt so bad and yet so disgusted like I don't know.

741
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,546
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like regardless of what happened in the show.

742
00:57:31,627 --> 00:57:35,920
Speaker 1: Just the noises coming out of the speakers, you know, just make you feel.

743
00:57:39,463 --> 00:57:42,740
Speaker 0: One other thing I just realized I forgot to mention this because I think this is really cool.

744
00:57:43,303 --> 00:57:56,660
Speaker 0: That really made the show good for me was that it really humanizes The robots in that when you see when there's a big robot fight There are almost never just generic robots fighting or background robots fighting every robot you see fighting.

745
00:57:57,042 --> 00:57:59,939
Speaker 0: They make sure you are fully aware that there is a person in there.

746
00:58:00,421 --> 00:58:05,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, they go to great lengths to make sure that you know, every time one of those blows up someone just died.

747
00:58:05,804 --> 00:58:06,800
Speaker 1: They always give the road.

748
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:12,624
Speaker 1: They always refer to the robots by the name of the robot, you know, and they make sure that you know Who is in each one?

749
00:58:13,106 --> 00:58:19,597
Speaker 1: So it's like, you know, they'd be like, you know, buster duel blitz go and you know Who's in buster duel and even extras.

750
00:58:19,637 --> 00:58:30,674
Speaker 0: like, you know Like a lot of shows if a robot gets blown up like either a parachute comes out or something or they just don't say anything Like oh the robot blew up, but this show go make sure it goes out of its way.

751
00:58:31,096 --> 00:58:31,337
Speaker 0: Yes.

752
00:58:31,377 --> 00:58:32,320
Speaker 0: There was a person in there.

753
00:58:32,441 --> 00:58:33,776
Speaker 0: Yes, you just heard him scream now.

754
00:58:33,816 --> 00:58:34,140
Speaker 0: He's dead.

755
00:58:34,381 --> 00:58:47,892
Speaker 1: Yeah, like even if like the random generic guy who has no name, you know is flying an airplane and blows up It's like they make sure you know that it wasn't just a blowing up plane It was oh my god That guy just killed a person.

756
00:58:48,213 --> 00:58:58,549
Speaker 0: because of course this show Like any Gundam show has a couple of very basic morals and without spoiling anything I think it's obvious to say that the primary moral of Gundam seed is War is bad.

757
00:59:00,144 --> 00:59:01,799
Speaker 0: Don't do it ever.

758
00:59:02,303 --> 00:59:03,551
Speaker 1: Racism is bad.

759
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:04,839
Speaker 1: War is bad.

760
00:59:05,301 --> 00:59:06,204
Speaker 1: Science is good.

761
00:59:06,264 --> 00:59:21,256
Speaker 1: As long as you use it for good, you know, it's okay to you know use Some sort of force to protect your friends from imminent death and save lives But kill as few people as possible, but don't be averse to killing if you need to.

762
00:59:21,456 --> 00:59:22,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't be a wuss.

763
00:59:23,267 --> 00:59:24,339
Speaker 0: Also be smart.

764
00:59:24,681 --> 00:59:31,624
Speaker 0: you'll notice in the show that any character that is stupid bad things happen to them as a result of their stupidity and Throughout the show.

765
00:59:31,644 --> 00:59:32,650
Speaker 0: It's like one by one.

766
00:59:32,731 --> 00:59:40,000
Speaker 0: all of the characters that don't die Suddenly become smart like it all clicks and they stop acting like idiots or like or they die.

767
00:59:40,423 --> 00:59:52,140
Speaker 1: well, the only time characters die is Because they either try to do something, you know way heroic Like I'm going to sacrifice myself for the greater good or I'm gonna go all out.

768
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:57,260
Speaker 1: You know to say help my friends even at the risk of my own life and that they'll die because of that.

769
00:59:57,781 --> 01:00:05,166
Speaker 1: You'll also die if you're stupid and you do some you know, you take stupid risks or your inexperience You don't know what you're doing.

770
01:00:05,407 --> 01:00:06,152
Speaker 1: You'll also die.

771
01:00:06,172 --> 01:00:07,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, the show is not afraid.

772
01:00:07,821 --> 01:00:11,074
Speaker 1: Also die if you know your ideas are wrong.

773
01:00:11,114 --> 01:00:12,620
Speaker 1: if you're a bad guy you're gonna die.

774
01:00:12,881 --> 01:00:14,633
Speaker 0: Yeah for the most part good guys die too.

775
01:00:14,754 --> 01:00:15,720
Speaker 1: Yeah good guys die, too.

776
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:18,972
Speaker 0: But for the reasons I stated a lot of people die in this show.

777
01:00:18,993 --> 01:00:20,920
Speaker 0: a lot of people die.

778
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:22,508
Speaker 1: There are a lot of characters dying.

779
01:00:22,930 --> 01:00:26,323
Speaker 1: Yeah, the show all your favorite characters Will die.

780
01:00:26,343 --> 01:00:30,275
Speaker 0: the show is not afraid to kill characters that are popular at all.

781
01:00:30,436 --> 01:00:32,849
Speaker 1: No, they'll die in the middle They'll die at the beginning.

782
01:00:32,869 --> 01:00:33,715
Speaker 1: They'll die at the end.

783
01:00:33,776 --> 01:00:34,260
Speaker 1: rusty die.

784
01:00:35,103 --> 01:00:45,140
Speaker 0: God the fact that there's a scene near the very end of the show where one character who is still alive is Going through in his mind all of the people who have died for what he is about to do.

785
01:00:45,322 --> 01:00:46,960
Speaker 1: He remembers rusty who died in the episode.

786
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:47,624
Speaker 1: He's like.

787
01:00:47,664 --> 01:00:49,958
Speaker 0: he remembers rusty and I can't believe that.

788
01:00:50,099 --> 01:00:59,544
Speaker 0: in fact We had a contest to sit to guess between the two of us which character who died Name would be said by other characters in that Rusty.

789
01:00:59,564 --> 01:01:12,815
Speaker 1: yeah other character like if someone's dead if someone's dead They'll mention them again and again in the show for many many episodes as they you know Look fondly back on that person's life or they're still upset about that person dying.

790
01:01:12,876 --> 01:01:15,747
Speaker 0: It's a very try gonna ask Yeah, that person died.

791
01:01:15,767 --> 01:01:16,690
Speaker 0: They are dead.

792
01:01:16,731 --> 01:01:19,040
Speaker 0: They're not coming back and they're dead because of your stupid war.

793
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:27,719
Speaker 0: Yeah in the last episode they'll remind you of every single named character who lost their lives and at that point you'll realize that a Lot of fucking people got axed in this show.

794
01:01:28,121 --> 01:01:32,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there's some that are mentioned more than others and that's how you tell who is really important.

795
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:37,120
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna ruin who won on the getting mentioned the most cuz that would be a number of spoilers.

796
01:01:37,261 --> 01:01:38,772
Speaker 1: It would be a number of spoilers.

797
01:01:38,833 --> 01:01:39,800
Speaker 0: I think we're done for now.

798
01:01:40,541 --> 01:01:44,258
Speaker 0: Um, I encourage all of you to see Gundam seed even if you don't think you would like it.

799
01:01:44,903 --> 01:01:47,759
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, if you don't watch it on TV Oh god.

800
01:01:48,161 --> 01:01:54,703
Speaker 0: Very briefly Cartoon Network butchered it in ways that I cannot express in the time I have left tonight.

801
01:01:54,743 --> 01:01:56,951
Speaker 1: if you watch it on Cartoon Network, no one dies.

802
01:01:57,393 --> 01:02:01,740
Speaker 0: not I mean characters die But they remove all the scenes that let you know.

803
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:06,020
Speaker 0: They die and whenever possible they remove the words kill or die from the dialogue.

804
01:02:06,642 --> 01:02:11,039
Speaker 0: They also replace all of the handguns with neon laser guns.

805
01:02:11,765 --> 01:02:22,048
Speaker 0: yeah, cuz and Characters don't just die in robots people get shot people get stabbed people get crushed people get exploded Rocket launcher terrorists.

806
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:24,036
Speaker 1: Yeah all kinds of crazy stuff.

807
01:02:24,639 --> 01:02:27,934
Speaker 0: So It's really the show is good.

808
01:02:28,316 --> 01:02:28,759
Speaker 0: watch it.

809
01:02:29,101 --> 01:02:30,005
Speaker 0: I think you'll like it.

810
01:02:30,346 --> 01:02:32,334
Speaker 0: give it at least like ten episodes.

811
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:35,685
Speaker 0: and if you don't like it after ten episodes Let us know and we're curious why.

812
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:40,860
Speaker 1: yeah, I mean there are 50 episodes in the show and I could understand it.

813
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:46,147
Speaker 1: If someone like one story arc and then didn't like another story arc There's like four or five.

814
01:02:46,207 --> 01:02:48,216
Speaker 0: judge the show on the first four episodes.

815
01:02:48,236 --> 01:02:49,200
Speaker 0: They start like any Gundam.

816
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:53,459
Speaker 1: yeah, there are like four or five or six story arcs in this thing depending on how you break it down.

817
01:02:53,479 --> 01:02:59,460
Speaker 1: and There are like four or five openers to the show and closer sets, you know, it's pretty big.

818
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:03,200
Speaker 1: So if you don't like one part, maybe you'll like the next part.

819
01:03:03,581 --> 01:03:08,460
Speaker 1: I really don't think very few people will not like it judging by the ratings on anime news network.

820
01:03:08,561 --> 01:03:12,063
Speaker 1: But this big green line and the very small red line Yeah,

821

822
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:41,540
