1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:06,660
Speaker 0: Alright, so, um, this week is not a very good week for us, really.

2
00:00:06,801 --> 00:00:07,378
Speaker 1: Oh, what can I say?

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:07,859
Speaker 1: We're busy.

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:19,920
Speaker 1: Something came up tonight, you know, it being Monday, and things seem to come up on Mondays, and Tuesday I'm going to a party with Emily in the Rainbow Room, so that's out, and Wednesday I guess we'll do a normal show, and then Thursday we're preparing for the New York Anime Festival.

5
00:00:20,741 --> 00:00:34,320
Speaker 0: So you're not gonna get much in the way of full-on geek nights, but that's okay, because we did a little experimental feed for you there, which is actually something we were gonna put on DVD way back when, but the-- The DVD that's done, but we never actually made.

6
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:40,360
Speaker 0: Well, because the DVDs, upon further inspection, proved to be an impractical idea, pretty much.

7
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:49,840
Speaker 0: Well, not so-- I mean-- Because we'd have to make them like a two-DVD set, and it would take a lot of money to print them, and there wasn't that much demand, and-- Or we could've printed them double-sided.

8
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:53,680
Speaker 0: That too, but it still, it wasn't very practical.

9
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,160
Speaker 1: It also would've been more practical if we decided not to give better audio quality.

10
00:00:58,802 --> 00:00:59,677
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's also true.

11
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:06,375
Speaker 1: I mean, people said, "Yeah, just put the lossless," and I don't think people realized that every episode of Geek Nights, even in flak form, is a good 130 megabytes.

12
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:16,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, if we would've put it lossless, it would've been like a 20-DVD set, probably more than that, for just one season, so... That was impractical.

13
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:22,740
Speaker 0: So we put the outtakes reel that was gonna be on the DVD in the experimental feed, because Rym finally decided to do something.

14
00:01:23,241 --> 00:01:28,680
Speaker 0: He's still sitting on a pile of unused audio over there, though, so-- That audio all originally had a purpose.

15
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,000
Speaker 1: I don't know, I guess I'll start putting a lot of it in the experimental feed.

16
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,371
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, over time, we've sort of accumulated unused, all this audio we were gonna use for something and we never did, so...

17
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:47,020
Speaker 1: The problem is, I have so much, but a lot of it, like, I have a great recording of a bunch of us playing Lacuna, but it's like three hours long.

18
00:01:47,781 --> 00:01:51,220
Speaker 1: Even if I encode it awesomely, it's still bigger than Libsyn.

19
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:57,819
Speaker 0: Yeah, we need some more Libsyn action before we can really start uploading a lot of other stuff besides the usual shows.

20
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,180
Speaker 1: Plus, I wonder who wants to listen to us play three hours of Lacuna.

21
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,479
Speaker 0: Someone who really is interested in Lacuna, there's nothing better to do?

22
00:02:05,447 --> 00:02:05,738
Speaker 0: I don't know.

23
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:15,019
Speaker 0: Anyway, so, we were actually gonna almost skip out on doing a show today, but there's something I really wanted to talk about, there's some big news is going on.

24
00:02:15,581 --> 00:02:21,819
Speaker 0: So we decided to do a special where we just talk about this one or two big newses that go together.

25
00:02:22,821 --> 00:02:25,040
Speaker 0: And the big newses have to do with Verizon, by the way.

26
00:02:25,242 --> 00:02:27,178
Speaker 0: If you haven't been paying attention to the tech world...

27
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,138
Speaker 1: You know, Verizon, that company that does... What do they do?

28
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,040
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't really interact with them that often, it's not like I use Verizon stuff every day.

29
00:02:36,805 --> 00:02:37,177
Speaker 0: But you do.

30
00:02:37,641 --> 00:02:38,056
Speaker 1: Yeah, I do.

31
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:44,120
Speaker 1: Verizon is pretty much one of the big iron telecommunications companies of the world.

32
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:52,320
Speaker 0: Well, at least in the United States, and especially over here in New York where we live, they are, in present day, the phone company.

33
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,260
Speaker 0: And they are also our cell phone company as well.

34
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,599
Speaker 1: I was Sprint, I stupidly switched to Verizon.

35
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:06,617
Speaker 1: But I feel like if I went back, I would be saying I stupidly switched back to Sprint, so I don't know what I'm gonna do.

36
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:13,495
Speaker 0: But I think, you know, while it seems like this, it's like, wow, Verizon's evil, you know, wow, Sprint sucks, wow, AT&T's evil, right?

37
00:03:14,821 --> 00:03:22,580
Speaker 0: So really, the only choice where you can't say, "Damn, I'm stupidly giving money to someone who's evil," is not have a cell phone.

38
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,120
Speaker 1: Well, no, but then, I need a landline, and I don't want to get into that.

39
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:27,640
Speaker 0: Well, you know what?

40
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,625
Speaker 0: If you want to get a landline here, it's Verizon, so... Aha!

41
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:37,480
Speaker 0: Right, so, way back in the olden days in the United States, there was one phone company.

42
00:03:37,902 --> 00:03:39,320
Speaker 1: It was called the phone company.

43
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:42,100
Speaker 0: It was AT&T, it was the big bell.

44
00:03:42,301 --> 00:03:45,520
Speaker 1: American was telegraph and telephone?

45
00:03:46,342 --> 00:03:47,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, something like that.

46
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:56,818
Speaker 0: Anyway, back in those days, if you wanted a telephone, you paid them, you know, a fee for all the long distance and, you know, your local phone calls and whatever.

47
00:03:56,858 --> 00:03:58,599
Speaker 0: every month you paid the phone bill, right?

48
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,440
Speaker 0: But they also gave you a telephone.

49
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08,140
Speaker 0: Well they didn't give you the telephone, you rented the telephone from them, sort of like how you rent your cable box from your cable company.

50
00:04:09,022 --> 00:04:11,040
Speaker 0: And you couldn't just get any old telephone you wanted.

51
00:04:11,202 --> 00:04:12,999
Speaker 0: You got the telephone, they gave you.

52
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,600
Speaker 1: Now, there were a lot of reasons for that.

53
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,431
Speaker 1: It wasn't really evil.

54
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:22,390
Speaker 1: It's not like the first phone company effectively in the world was thinking, "Aw man, we're going to totally fuck the

55
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,057
Speaker 1: consumers.".

56
00:04:23,702 --> 00:04:26,300
Speaker 1: What they were thinking is, one, this is new technology.

57
00:04:26,983 --> 00:04:28,980
Speaker 1: It's expensive and complicated technology.

58
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,796
Speaker 1: I mean, think about it.

59
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:39,899
Speaker 1: The telephone, a regular landline with like a rotary dial or something, that may not seem like the most technologically advanced thing today, but that was a big deal back then.

60
00:04:40,365 --> 00:04:41,359
Speaker 1: A really big deal.

61
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:47,140
Speaker 1: And the network was very kind of cobbled together.

62
00:04:47,481 --> 00:04:49,220
Speaker 1: I mean, remember the days of the night?

63
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:58,659
Speaker 1: Well, maybe not remember, but in the 80s and early 90s, there was, you know, phone freaking and the telecommunications network of this country was very primitive compared to what it is today.

64
00:04:59,201 --> 00:05:06,439
Speaker 1: And it had a lot of voltages and things that it'd be like a telephone back then, theoretically, could take down the entire network.

65
00:05:06,702 --> 00:05:08,118
Speaker 0: Well, not really, but...

66
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,778
Speaker 1: Well, it could take down a small section of the network and it could cascade and...

67
00:05:12,224 --> 00:05:12,520
Speaker 0: Maybe.

68
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:24,796
Speaker 0: See, the logic the phone companies used for forcing everyone to use the telephone they gave them was, "We don't want you to use a device that we haven't tested, you know, with our equipment, you know, because you might damage our equipment,".

69
00:05:24,837 --> 00:05:25,500
Speaker 0: or something like that.

70
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,860
Speaker 1: I do believe that back then it was a valid concern.

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,356
Speaker 0: Well, it wasn't super valid, but it did have some validity, but it wasn't like, "Oh man, people with their own phones are just going to destroy

72
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:35,780
Speaker 0: everything.".

73
00:05:36,224 --> 00:05:37,577
Speaker 0: It was like, "Well, there's a chance it could

74
00:05:37,597 --> 00:05:37,840
Speaker 0: happen.".

75
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:56,480
Speaker 0: And, you know, basically, because everyone was just using the same equipment on this network, it's sort of like, you know, if you have a thing and you're testing it for bugs, but you only keep pushing, it has like five buttons, but you only keep pushing the first button, you never know what those other buttons are going to do.

76
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:19,940
Speaker 0: So when they finally, you know, allowed all sorts of other things to be plugged into the phone lines, you know, all sorts of, you know, touch tone phones and whatever people came up with, that's when, you know, people started finding out, "Oh, look, we can do this crazy stuff with the phone network," which was something they never worried about before because the only devices anyone was using were the ones they gave them and they weren't able to find those things out or anything.

77
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:28,620
Speaker 1: Well, plus, I mean, just think, back then the phones were basically just copper cables that had barely any useful logic between them.

78
00:06:28,981 --> 00:06:30,980
Speaker 1: There were human switches, human.

79
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:38,780
Speaker 0: So what happened eventually is they said, "All right, you know, you guys have to let anyone use whatever they want, whatever phone they want.

80
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,955
Speaker 0: You can't just force people to write your

81
00:06:40,995 --> 00:06:41,338
Speaker 0: phones.".

82
00:06:41,640 --> 00:07:08,284
Speaker 0: And actually, this is a lot better for the phone company because what they didn't realize was allowing anyone to use whatever device they wanted on the network, right, and do use the network in any way they could make it get used, was that people started finding new uses for the phone network, like, you know, calling it and like having phone sex or, you know, buying stuff over the phone and, you know, because people can hook up auto dialers.

83
00:07:08,404 --> 00:07:09,930
Speaker 0: or, you know, there'd be telemarketing.

84
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:29,700
Speaker 0: and, you know, because there was other devices allowed to be plugged into the phone network besides the phones from the phone company, people found all these new uses for the phone network and thus the phone network got a lot more use overall and the phone company got a lot more money from people using the phone network because they still own the network and you still have to pay to use it.

85
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:34,195
Speaker 0: You could just use it in any way that you could find to use it instead of the one way they let you use it.

86
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:40,380
Speaker 0: So, go to the present day and you have cell phones, at least in the United States.

87
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,600
Speaker 0: Other countries, it's actually good or more good.

88
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:48,799
Speaker 1: I think we should do at some point a show on just the history straight up technologically of the phone network.

89
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,078
Speaker 0: That's the history that I know.

90
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:53,920
Speaker 0: Well, I see- You've already got everything I know.

91
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,678
Speaker 1: Well, I'll say this.

92
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:00,960
Speaker 1: I didn't, because Scott basically said, "I'm going to do the big old Verizon show," and I pretty much let him just run with it however he wanted.

93
00:08:02,923 --> 00:08:09,548
Speaker 1: I wasn't sure where he was going with it, so I figure I'd like to talk about the history of the national phone company.

94
00:08:09,568 --> 00:08:15,440
Speaker 1: and then they broke it up and then why different companies now have control of different areas and all the deregulation.

95
00:08:16,425 --> 00:08:17,619
Speaker 1: But I think that's another show.

96
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:28,217
Speaker 0: Well, basically, I know what happened, but I don't know any more than ... I mean, you'll learn a little more about the history of the US phone companies and networks from Wikipedia than you will learn from me.

97
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:29,940
Speaker 0: So, anyway.

98
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,179
Speaker 1: I know a bit, but I took a class on that at RIT.

99
00:08:32,943 --> 00:08:34,059
Speaker 0: See, I didn't take class on that.

100
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:34,357
Speaker 0: Anyway.

101
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,740
Speaker 0: So, fast forward to today to cell phone companies in the United States.

102
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,140
Speaker 0: Now, there's not just one, like there was just one AT&T back in the day.

103
00:08:42,385 --> 00:08:42,659
Speaker 1: There's two.

104
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:50,560
Speaker 0: Well, there's like four or five and then there's local operators and there's MVNOs, so there's actually competition in this arena.

105
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,679
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time, it seems like most people, your real choices are between Sprint and Verizon.

106
00:08:56,165 --> 00:08:57,560
Speaker 0: Well, that's only because of where we live.

107
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,140
Speaker 0: You also have the AT&T and T-Mobile are legitimate choices.

108
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it depends on where you live.

109
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,240
Speaker 1: I mean, if you live somewhere out in the boonies, you pretty much don't have a choice in a lot of cases.

110
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,580
Speaker 0: It's just- You might just not be able to use one out there.

111
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,719
Speaker 1: Well, like when I lived in the mountains over by Poquare, right?

112
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,880
Speaker 1: Verizon got service just fine.

113
00:09:14,261 --> 00:09:15,900
Speaker 1: You could not have a Sprint phone out there.

114
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,457
Speaker 1: It just didn't work.

115
00:09:16,903 --> 00:09:17,234
Speaker 1: And T-Mobile?

116
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:17,710
Speaker 0: Ha!

117
00:09:19,001 --> 00:09:23,855
Speaker 0: Well, T-Mobile actually, and some other people, they offer like, there's phones with Wi-Fi now.

118
00:09:24,161 --> 00:09:27,970
Speaker 0: And what you can do is, let's say you live in the boonies, but you have a Wi-Fi router in your house.

119
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,019
Speaker 1: 'Cause I could get Wi-Fi out there.

120
00:09:31,221 --> 00:09:35,820
Speaker 0: Uh, you plug your wireless router into your cable- Wireless router into what?

121
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,479
Speaker 1: There's no cable modems out there.

122
00:09:37,705 --> 00:09:37,956
Speaker 0: Your DSL.

123
00:09:38,321 --> 00:09:39,319
Speaker 1: There's no DSL out there.

124
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:39,585
Speaker 0: Your T1.

125
00:09:40,782 --> 00:09:41,760
Speaker 1: There's no way to get a T1 out there.

126
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:42,939
Speaker 0: Well, that's the super boonies then.

127
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,020
Speaker 1: That's not the super boonies.

128
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,379
Speaker 1: That's like 30 miles from here.

129
00:09:45,962 --> 00:09:46,958
Speaker 1: Anyway- To the left.

130
00:09:47,322 --> 00:09:47,779
Speaker 1: Right there.

131
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:54,537
Speaker 0: Point is, point is, is that the way these companies operate in the U.S.

132
00:09:54,597 --> 00:09:58,920
Speaker 0: right now is, if you want a cell phone, you go to their store, the Verizon store.

133
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,638
Speaker 0: You don't go to the Nokia store, you know, where they have, you know, there's no such thing.

134
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,100
Speaker 0: You don't, you know, buy a phone from the people who make the phones.

135
00:10:05,481 --> 00:10:07,260
Speaker 0: You buy a phone from the phone company.

136
00:10:07,763 --> 00:10:09,319
Speaker 0: And they have a bunch of phones to choose from.

137
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:17,460
Speaker 0: And they'll talk about how they, they had their support consumer choice, 'cause they've got all these phones to choose from, la da da, and all these different, this is a solution for everybody.

138
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:18,058
Speaker 0: And they do.

139
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,560
Speaker 0: They have phones ranging from the cheap to the crazy.

140
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,560
Speaker 0: So you go there and you pick out a phone, and the phone is ludicrously cheap.

141
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,155
Speaker 0: Like $100 for what would usually be a $300 phone.

142
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,358
Speaker 1: Oftentimes, they're free.

143
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:30,860
Speaker 0: Oftentimes they are free.

144
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,041
Speaker 0: I mean, the iPhone is $400.

145
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:37,120
Speaker 0: In any other country, it's like $1,000 if it's not from the phone company.

146
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,039
Speaker 1: And like my current phone, it's a Motorola Razr.

147
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:43,240
Speaker 1: I paid zero for it, and it was actually the crappiest cell phone they had to offer.

148
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:44,580
Speaker 1: It was just free, and I didn't care.

149
00:10:44,781 --> 00:10:48,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's like a, that was like a $300 device if you bought it alone.

150
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause it's a, it's a very advanced piece of technology.

151
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:52,469
Speaker 0: Yep.

152
00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:00,340
Speaker 0: But it's free, because the way they operate is they will, they subsidize the phone, which, you know, means that they pay for the phone, basically.

153
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,639
Speaker 0: They eat that cost.

154
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:12,040
Speaker 0: But you have to sign this big, long contract, usually two or more years, which means you're stuck with that phone, and it's, you're definitely, you're usually stuck with the phone.

155
00:11:12,501 --> 00:11:18,098
Speaker 0: But you're stuck with them as your cell phone provider for at least two years, paying that monthly bill.

156
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:31,600
Speaker 0: And if you do the math, they win on that, 'cause if they sell, give you a $300 phone for like 50 bucks, you're gonna be giving them 250 bucks in like a few months, and then the rest of those months is pretty much the profits.

157
00:11:32,121 --> 00:11:39,100
Speaker 0: And if you actually start using, you know, their network for stuff, they're gonna make a lot more money, 'cause they'll charge you for this, and they'll charge you for that.

158
00:11:39,261 --> 00:11:46,039
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's one thing, I mean, I remember, I didn't really use the feature, I mean, 'cause my first cell phone was basically-- Calling, and that's it.

159
00:11:46,341 --> 00:11:47,799
Speaker 1: It, I mean, it didn't have a screen.

160
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:58,379
Speaker 1: It was a brick, and it lasted maybe an hour, and it was analog and horrible, and phones, and I remember Scott's first cell phone was a great phone for the time, for calling, but it didn't really do anything else.

161
00:11:58,741 --> 00:12:00,696
Speaker 0: It did, it had some stuff in it, but it was-- Barely.

162
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,520
Speaker 0: It had a web browser, but it was-- Yeah, yeah, it had a web browser, technically.

163
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:04,930
Speaker 0: Yeah.

164
00:12:05,502 --> 00:12:13,260
Speaker 0: Anyway, so, the other thing that's a problem here is that, let's say they give you a phone that can text message, that's great, but they charge you.

165
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:20,459
Speaker 0: Every text message you send, you have to pay for, and unless you wanna get the unlimited text message plan-- But that's like 15 bucks a month!

166
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,220
Speaker 0: Right, so it's sorta like you have to pay for text messaging.

167
00:12:24,221 --> 00:12:33,539
Speaker 0: You can listen to music on this thing, but unless you're a lead person like me, you're not gonna be able to get music on there, 'cause you have no idea how the hell to do that.

168
00:12:35,262 --> 00:12:42,440
Speaker 0: And, now you see, the only way you know how to get music on there is to buy it from the Verizon store in your phone, and they charge you for that.

169
00:12:42,861 --> 00:12:44,339
Speaker 0: Oh, you can play games on your phone!

170
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:53,079
Speaker 0: Oh, but the only way you can get games on there that's easy is to buy games on your phone for like five bucks, and some games you even have to pay like a monthly fee for.

171
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:59,300
Speaker 1: I mean, I remember, my first, my cell phone, as opposed to my parents' cell phone that they gave me, was Sprint.

172
00:13:00,007 --> 00:13:00,200
Speaker 1: Alright.

173
00:13:00,801 --> 00:13:03,100
Speaker 1: And one day, I got a phone that could take pictures.

174
00:13:04,171 --> 00:13:05,040
Speaker 1: It could take pictures!

175
00:13:05,523 --> 00:13:05,898
Speaker 1: Oh man!

176
00:13:06,501 --> 00:13:07,239
Speaker 1: And I took a picture.

177
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,280
Speaker 1: I'm like, "Alright, great.

178
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,810
Speaker 1: Now how do I get this on my

179
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:10,274
Speaker 1: computer?".

180
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:16,266
Speaker 1: And Sprint was like, "Oh, well, if you pay for the $15 a month, get pictures off your phone

181
00:13:16,347 --> 00:13:16,852
Speaker 1: service!".

182
00:13:17,683 --> 00:13:18,379
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, come on.

183
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:28,096
Speaker 0: Imagine if you had, you bought a digital camera at the store, you took a bunch of pictures, and then every time you wanted to take the pictures off the camera and put them on your computer, you had to pay money.

184
00:13:29,222 --> 00:13:37,840
Speaker 1: Even worse, there was, back then, there was no option with my phone, or with Sprint at that time, of getting like a picture off and paying a nickel or whatever.

185
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:48,280
Speaker 0: It was just- Yeah, with my Verizon phone, the official way to get the pictures off was to pay 25 cents for every photo you wanted to get off, and basically email it from the phone to yourself, and then download the attachment.

186
00:13:48,442 --> 00:13:49,220
Speaker 1: I couldn't even do that!

187
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:54,440
Speaker 1: I had to pay $15 a month to get the service, which was, get pictures off your phone.

188
00:13:55,241 --> 00:14:06,099
Speaker 0: So, because I knew what I was doing, I bought a USB cable for like $15, plugged it into my phone, and I was able to get the pictures off with some trickiness, but most people can't do that.

189
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,580
Speaker 1: Well, plus, sometimes you can't do that.

190
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,939
Speaker 1: I mean, my phone, we looked, there was no way to do it.

191
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:11,290
Speaker 1: Yep.

192
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:19,599
Speaker 0: So, they give you these phones with all these features, but then they charge you every time you use the features, and that's to make up for the fact that they subsidize the phone crazily.

193
00:14:19,841 --> 00:14:26,265
Speaker 1: Well, Scott, what if me, being a smart consumer, decides that it's worth it to say, "Buy the phone from the company,"?

194
00:14:26,285 --> 00:14:30,120
Speaker 1: you know, because I know what I want, so I get the Nokia whatever awesome that does it.

195
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:30,668
Speaker 0: And you pay $600 for it.

196
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, alright, but it's, I got all the functionality, it's just, it's a phone.

197
00:14:35,222 --> 00:14:37,559
Speaker 1: And then I just use it with Sprint, or Verizon.

198
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:42,300
Speaker 0: Well, uh, first of all- I'm asking a question that's pointed.

199
00:14:42,820 --> 00:15:02,480
Speaker 0: Well, it depends, because it, for example, the Nokia N95, you can't really use that with Verizon, because Verizon's a CDMA/EVDU network, and the Nokia N95, most of the world, uses GSM, GPRS, Edge, and HSDPA, and those sorts, those technologies.

200
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:24,019
Speaker 0: Verizon and Sprint use CDMA, EVDU, EVDU's actually better than the competition, but, you know, those sorts of technologies, so, like a Verizon phone, even if Verizon wasn't evil, you just couldn't use it with, say, T-Mobile, because it's a different radio, it just won't work, period.

201
00:15:24,821 --> 00:15:39,300
Speaker 0: The same way like an iPhone, an iPhone won't work with Verizon, it has a different radio in it, there's nothing you can do short of replacing the radio in the phone, and then replacing the firmware in the phone, and that's not something a hacker is capable of doing.

202
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,940
Speaker 0: You basically have to make a whole new device.

203
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:48,813
Speaker 1: Yeah, now there are a lot of reasons for why America uses these different standards generally, and they're not, it's not 100% just, "Oh, they're

204
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:48,974
Speaker 1: evil.".

205
00:15:50,120 --> 00:16:06,380
Speaker 1: There's also a lot of people, when they complain about American technology, seem to forget that America's big, and that, I mean, you could pretty much redo all of the cell service for a nation like Israel or Japan in a relatively small number of years, or...

206
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:15,020
Speaker 0: The thing about Israel, the state of Israel, which actually, that's one of the few places that also uses CDMA, is about the size of the state of New Jersey, right?

207
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:27,299
Speaker 0: So if you wanted to upgrade cell phone service to be stupidly fast, and upgrade internet and telephone to be stupidly fast in Israel, it would take you not very long if you had the resources to do it, which they do.

208
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:38,360
Speaker 0: Now you want to do that to the entire United States of America, where you have a state like New York right next to New Jersey, which is like five New Jerseys, and you got California, and you got Alaska, and you got Texas.

209
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, New Jersey is one of our smaller states.

210
00:16:40,982 --> 00:16:41,413
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right.

211
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:54,220
Speaker 0: So because the United States is so geographically huge, and there's people all over it, I mean, sure, people in New York City, they can get some stuff, but it doesn't work out.

212
00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:01,839
Speaker 1: Even New York City is pretty big, and some of those technologies run into problems of there's too many people in one place, so it doesn't work as well.

213
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,400
Speaker 0: For example, right, here's the office building that I work in, right?

214
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,339
Speaker 0: There's no cable in that building.

215
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:12,315
Speaker 0: You can get telephone lines from Verizon, you can get DSL, you can get a T1 or something.

216
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,280
Speaker 0: You can't get fiber into the building.

217
00:17:16,901 --> 00:17:19,818
Speaker 0: They have to use a satellite dish to get television, and that's it.

218
00:17:20,641 --> 00:17:22,180
Speaker 0: They don't let anything else in the building.

219
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:22,778
Speaker 0: There's no cable.

220
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:23,798
Speaker 0: You have no choice.

221
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,319
Speaker 0: And that's in New York.

222
00:17:25,882 --> 00:17:26,816
Speaker 0: That's in Manhattan.

223
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:30,959
Speaker 0: You can't get fast internet no matter how much you're going to pay for it.

224
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:37,759
Speaker 1: Now granted, part of that is that your building management is probably not the sharpest tech in the tool shed.

225
00:17:38,003 --> 00:17:38,658
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

226
00:17:39,221 --> 00:17:42,159
Speaker 1: So I've run into that before, where building managers just don't get it.

227
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:44,640
Speaker 0: Well, that's big union business, but anyway.

228
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:55,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it's like this trifecta of unions and just building management and the telecos that all fight with each other and try to lock each other out all the time.

229
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:05,151
Speaker 0: Well, in every other country in the world, or most other countries in the world, the way it works is you buy whatever phone you want, but you're going to have to pay full price for that phone, but that's okay, because it's your phone, you can do whatever you want with it.

230
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:10,500
Speaker 0: And then you go, and you want to get a phone number, and you want to have service.

231
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,220
Speaker 0: So you buy this little card, this little SIM card, and you put it in your phone.

232
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:15,559
Speaker 0: And now your phone works.

233
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:21,740
Speaker 0: Now let's say you fly over to the United States, and you want to keep using your phone, but you need to use it on a US phone network.

234
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,720
Speaker 0: Well, you take the card out, you buy a card from T-Mobile, you put it in, and now you're talking on T-Mobile.

235
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,619
Speaker 0: And you go back home, you get rid of the T-Mobile card, you put your old card back in.

236
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,500
Speaker 0: So you can use your phone on any phone network just by switching out this little tiny card.

237
00:18:33,923 --> 00:18:35,578
Speaker 1: Why can't I do that in the US?

238
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:44,160
Speaker 0: Well, you can kind of do it sometimes, but let's say I go and I buy a phone from T-Mobile in the US, right, that works with these little cards, right?

239
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:58,815
Speaker 0: If I try to put, say, a card from AT&T in there, right, I want to use this phone on the AT&T network maybe because I'm somewhere, I'm on a trip in California maybe, so I buy like 20 minutes of prepaid calling from AT&T because they have better service wherever I am.

240
00:18:59,843 --> 00:19:00,719
Speaker 0: The phone is locked.

241
00:19:00,901 --> 00:19:04,300
Speaker 0: If I put a different little card in there, it just will refuse to work.

242
00:19:04,741 --> 00:19:10,991
Speaker 0: It'll say, "Sorry, I'm not going to use that card because I am locked to the T-Mobile network and I will not use any other card from any other

243
00:19:11,011 --> 00:19:11,313
Speaker 0: network.".

244
00:19:13,481 --> 00:19:23,960
Speaker 0: And every other country in the world doesn't work like that, except the US, because they don't want you to buy a phone from them, which, you know, usually when you buy a phone from them it's subsidized, and then go using it with other networks.

245
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:37,440
Speaker 0: Technically, they say, they say on paper that if you ask, they will sell you an unsubsidized phone at the full price, and then they will give you unlock codes and let you unlock the phone, but people have had varying levels of success with that.

246
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,459
Speaker 0: Very varying levels of success.

247
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:46,779
Speaker 0: Okay, so, there's two big newses that I brought this about, and that's just the, that's the buildup to these big newses, right?

248
00:19:47,541 --> 00:20:02,016
Speaker 0: The first big news is that Verizon, until now the most evil of the cell phone carriers in terms of locking shit down and being assholes, has come out with a press release that says, "By the end of 2008, we will allow any phone with any

249
00:20:02,177 --> 00:20:02,297
Speaker 0: app.".

250
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:29,300
Speaker 0: So basically they're saying that by the end of 2008, any phone that will work with Verizon's network that they approve, you know, that they're gonna test the phones in their little lab to make sure that, you know, they're not gonna, you know, be evil, and like, destroy the network with broken radios or anything, but you know, let's say, you know, they approve the phone in their lab, and then they will let you use the, anyone who wants to use that phone with the Verizon network and run any application on that phone that they want.

251
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,520
Speaker 0: And that's how it's gonna work, supposedly.

252
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:41,757
Speaker 0: Now- And this is a big news because it's, this is like, this is like the biggest turn, imagine the most evil person there is who's like, "Ah ha

253
00:20:41,777 --> 00:20:42,078
Speaker 0: ha.".

254
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:46,699
Speaker 1: He's like, "I have stolen all the candy in the world, and there's nothing you can do,".

255
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,051
Speaker 0: and then suddenly he's like- And then five minutes later he's like, "Candy for

256
00:20:49,293 --> 00:20:50,058
Speaker 0: everybody!".

257
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,315
Speaker 0: "Forever!".

258
00:20:51,701 --> 00:20:52,779
Speaker 0: "Candy for the babies!

259
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:54,249
Speaker 0: Everybody free

260
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:54,796
Speaker 0: candy!".

261
00:20:55,281 --> 00:21:07,068
Speaker 0: It's like the biggest turnaround, and everyone's like, it's almost a too-good-to-be-true turnaround, and everyone's coming up with all these reasons like, "Huh, it's evil because of this, it's evil because of that, it's evil because of this,".

262
00:21:07,129 --> 00:21:17,555
Speaker 0: and you know, Verizon as a whole is sort of weird company, like they're evil sometimes, and sometimes they're not evil, you know, like when someone goes and says, "Hey, Verizon, give me all these,".

263
00:21:17,575 --> 00:21:22,542
Speaker 0: you know, when the RIA comes to Verizon, you know, and says, "Hey, tell us who these people are so we can go after them,".

264
00:21:22,562 --> 00:21:24,815
Speaker 0: Verizon goes, "Uh-uh, we're not gonna do

265
00:21:24,856 --> 00:21:24,956
Speaker 0: that.".

266
00:21:25,861 --> 00:21:28,797
Speaker 0: But then Verizon says, "Yeah, net neutrality, fuck

267
00:21:28,838 --> 00:21:29,039
Speaker 0: that!".

268
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,200
Speaker 0: So it's like, "Ah, make up your mind, are you good or evil?

269
00:21:32,461 --> 00:21:32,827
Speaker 0: You can't be

270
00:21:32,868 --> 00:21:33,031
Speaker 0: both.".

271
00:21:33,882 --> 00:21:37,115
Speaker 1: I think they're mostly evil, maybe they don't realize that what they're doing isn't that evil.

272
00:21:37,624 --> 00:21:37,815
Speaker 0: Maybe.

273
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:38,876
Speaker 0: I don't know.

274
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:45,580
Speaker 0: But yeah, basically, if this is true, this is actually a great business move for them.

275
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:52,299
Speaker 0: Remember how opening I just explained, how letting anyone use whatever phone they wanted with the regular phone lines was good for the phone company?

276
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:58,959
Speaker 0: But Verizon lets anyone use whatever phone they want with Verizon, that's gonna be great for them, and this is why.

277
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:08,240
Speaker 0: People who are from foreign countries, right, if they come to the US, they're pretty much gonna either buy a little card from AT&T or a little card from T-Mobile, right?

278
00:22:09,482 --> 00:22:26,539
Speaker 0: They still might have trouble buying a little card from Verizon because Verizon loves to work with little SIM cards, but there'll be a better chance that, you know, maybe someone from like a country that uses CDMA will come here and they'll be able to use their crazy phone on the Verizon network and Verizon will make some money off that.

279
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:40,040
Speaker 0: Also, crazy nerds like you and me who want to use any crazy phone with some crazy applications on it, but Verizon, like right where I live, Verizon has the best coverage and the best service and the fastest speeds.

280
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:43,219
Speaker 0: That's just what it happens to be around New York.

281
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:54,219
Speaker 0: So people like me will be going with Verizon even though we used to hate them and still kind of do hate them because they're the only way we can use the phones and the applications we want.

282
00:22:54,940 --> 00:23:03,738
Speaker 0: But meanwhile, they're not gonna stop doing business the way they currently do it with the subsidized phones and the whatever, so all the normal people will still be making them lots of money that way.

283
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:20,860
Speaker 0: So it's basically they're making everyone happy and it's like, you know, they have this other thing and I guess if everyone took advantage of any phone, any app, that might hurt them, but I think most people, only the nerds and foreigners are really gonna take advantage of that and normal people are gonna keep going the way they're going.

284
00:23:22,362 --> 00:23:24,639
Speaker 0: So it's actually a really good business move if it's true.

285
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,519
Speaker 0: Now, why are we skeptical of this?

286
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:35,860
Speaker 0: Huh, well, first of all, Verizon, when they say, you know, it's mostly all about the data service, right?

287
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:41,120
Speaker 0: 'Cause, I mean, calling, whatever, it's all about, you know, browsing the web and downloading stuff and watching YouTube.

288
00:23:41,401 --> 00:23:42,579
Speaker 1: Why don't I just run Skype?

289
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,139
Speaker 0: Actually I think VoIP was one of the things in their press release they specifically said they were gonna allow.

290
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:48,625
Speaker 0: Wow.

291
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:49,560
Speaker 0: Yeah.

292
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:57,460
Speaker 0: 'Cause they're going, the first skeptical thing people are saying is they're going to be charging up the ass for this data service.

293
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:02,680
Speaker 0: They're probably gonna be charging like by the bit rate or something, you know, the more you download, the more they're gonna charge you.

294
00:24:03,321 --> 00:24:07,120
Speaker 0: And their plan is to like get people used to like exorbitant data costs.

295
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:14,718
Speaker 0: 'Cause right now, Verizon Unlimited Data Service, right, is like $80 a month for Unlimited or something ridiculous like that.

296
00:24:15,302 --> 00:24:16,340
Speaker 0: But it's not really Unlimited.

297
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,960
Speaker 0: If you start using it in a way they don't like, they could just cut you off.

298
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,598
Speaker 1: Yeah, the TOS are pretty much, "Yeah, we can cut you off for any

299
00:24:23,638 --> 00:24:23,979
Speaker 1: reason.".

300
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,040
Speaker 0: Like if you start watching YouTubes on your phone, they'll just cut you off.

301
00:24:27,582 --> 00:24:28,560
Speaker 0: It just, it's like, "What the hell?

302
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,580
Speaker 0: I'm paying for Unlimited here.

303
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,335
Speaker 0: I should be able to do whatever I

304
00:24:30,355 --> 00:24:30,580
Speaker 0: want.".

305
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,871
Speaker 1: Well, see, we've always had this problem in the U.S.

306
00:24:32,911 --> 00:24:35,240
Speaker 1: because broadband providers always do the same thing.

307
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,151
Speaker 1: They say, "Yeah, unlimited

308
00:24:36,192 --> 00:24:36,617
Speaker 1: bandwidth.".

309
00:24:36,921 --> 00:24:38,411
Speaker 1: And I think that's false advertising.

310
00:24:38,431 --> 00:24:39,640
Speaker 1: 'cause it's never unlimited.

311
00:24:40,202 --> 00:24:42,800
Speaker 1: There's always some arbitrary and usually somewhat too low.

312
00:24:43,142 --> 00:24:46,220
Speaker 0: My problem is not that they're not providing unlimited stuff.

313
00:24:47,324 --> 00:24:50,660
Speaker 0: I could deal with some limits 'cause I'd never go over those limits anyway.

314
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,999
Speaker 0: They're ludicrous limits usually.

315
00:24:52,680 --> 00:25:00,720
Speaker 0: But the problem is, and of course, the reality of the world is that there isn't enough bandwidth to support everyone using it unlimitedly.

316
00:25:00,881 --> 00:25:01,558
Speaker 0: It just doesn't happen.

317
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:07,700
Speaker 1: But companies can't pretend that they can offer unlimited and then get mad and cut off customers who actually try to use their bandwidth.

318
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,640
Speaker 0: They have to advertise correctly.

319
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,360
Speaker 0: The advertising right now is false and that's the big issue.

320
00:25:13,881 --> 00:25:19,798
Speaker 0: So, yeah, Verizon, they say they're gonna open it up and, well, we'll see how much they open it up.

321
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:25,040
Speaker 0: Now, my personal worry is that Verizon is pretty slow at getting new phones.

322
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,800
Speaker 0: Like, if a new phone comes out, Verizon is usually the last place to offer that phone.

323
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,840
Speaker 0: It's like you can get the new phones with everyone else first and then Verizon.

324
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:39,260
Speaker 0: And the reason is when Verizon likes to test those phones in their lab to make sure they'll have absolutely no problems.

325
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:45,380
Speaker 0: And that lab actually does a pretty good job because usually phones you get from Verizon are probably the least buggy, you know?

326
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,440
Speaker 0: Like you buy like a trio from someone else and it'll be crashing and stuff and whatever.

327
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:55,660
Speaker 0: Verizon generally really heavily test their phones and they work, they don't crash at least.

328
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,700
Speaker 0: They don't make problems.

329
00:25:57,041 --> 00:26:00,680
Speaker 0: They might not be the greatest phones, but they work because they were tested thoroughly.

330
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:05,959
Speaker 0: The thing is, those phones are usually old because they tested them for so long in that lab.

331
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:14,960
Speaker 0: And here's my skepticality is they're gonna be testing, you know, they're still not gonna allow you to use a phone on their network unless it's been tested.

332
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,740
Speaker 0: They'll probably test them slow enough to where-- They'll probably test them so slowly that it's like, "I'm a nerd.

333
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,120
Speaker 0: I wanna buy this brand new phone that came out yesterday in South Korea and start using

334
00:26:23,606 --> 00:26:23,691
Speaker 0: it.".

335
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,500
Speaker 0: But I gotta wait like a year for them to test it in their lab.

336
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,120
Speaker 0: Someone has to pay them to test it in their lab, even though the fee might be reasonable.

337
00:26:32,741 --> 00:26:33,919
Speaker 0: Someone still has to pay that fee.

338
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,118
Speaker 0: Who's gonna pay that fee?

339
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,420
Speaker 0: I mean, the Korean phone maker, are they really-- Do they care?

340
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,509
Speaker 0: Are they gonna make that much money by Verizon--?

341
00:26:40,689 --> 00:26:48,708
Speaker 1: Are we going to see a bunch of websites spring up or people like on Farke saying, "All right, everybody, let's all chip in and pay to get this phone

342
00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:49,154
Speaker 1: tested.".

343
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then six months later, the phone is finally tested, but then a new version of the phone comes out.

344
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,048
Speaker 0: Yeah, the N81Q came out.

345
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,092
Speaker 1: No one cares about the N81DR.

346
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:57,246
Speaker 1: Yeah.

347
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,280
Speaker 0: And you know, it's like, let's say you're a phone company, you're a phone maker, right?

348
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,100
Speaker 0: And you make a phone for Japan, right?

349
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:08,960
Speaker 0: And you think, "Huh, some people in Japan might wanna go to the US and use their phones

350
00:27:09,064 --> 00:27:09,272
Speaker 0: there.".

351
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:14,458
Speaker 0: So those people might want the phone to be Verizon tested so they can use Verizon if they go to the US.

352
00:27:15,522 --> 00:27:19,780
Speaker 0: And also, there might be some nerds in the US who wanna buy this phone 'cause it's a really cool phone, all right?

353
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,819
Speaker 0: So they might want Verizon to test the phone in the US.

354
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,740
Speaker 0: Maybe that's a few hundred people from Japan and a few hundred people from the US.

355
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:39,400
Speaker 0: Is it really worth, even if the fee is reasonable, paying Verizon to test the phone and sending them the phones and dealing with them and fixing things if they want them to be fixed and all that bullshit just for a few hundred Japanese people and a few hundred Americans?

356
00:27:39,821 --> 00:27:43,914
Speaker 0: Is that really gonna be enough business to make it worth it if you're the Japanese phone maker?

357
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:45,458
Speaker 0: I don't know.

358
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:46,939
Speaker 0: It's gonna be tough.

359
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:52,039
Speaker 0: So there's another piece of Verizon news that adds on to this.

360
00:27:53,402 --> 00:28:00,638
Speaker 0: Right now, people always talk about the 2Gs and the 3Gs and the 4Gs and all the Gs, right, when it comes to phones.

361
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,680
Speaker 0: And basically, all that means is second generation, third generation, fourth generation, right?

362
00:28:06,201 --> 00:28:08,120
Speaker 0: Right now, we're in the third generation.

363
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,760
Speaker 0: Evdu and HSDPA are third generation.

364
00:28:11,405 --> 00:28:13,180
Speaker 0: That means it's faster.

365
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:19,140
Speaker 0: You want a 3G phone to use 3G networks and stuff because your phone will be better that way.

366
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,080
Speaker 0: You'll get faster data, a better connection, clearer talking, right?

367
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,340
Speaker 0: So if you're Verizon or Sprint, that means Evdu.

368
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,115
Speaker 0: And if you're someone else, it means HSDPA.

369
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:34,480
Speaker 0: Generation two is like GPRS and Edge and that sort of stuff, right?

370
00:28:35,102 --> 00:28:37,597
Speaker 0: And that's what the iPhone uses, use Edge, which is G2.

371
00:28:38,181 --> 00:28:41,379
Speaker 0: So that's why it's slow and why nerds complain about the iPhone being slow.

372
00:28:43,302 --> 00:28:48,451
Speaker 0: G4, right, which is the next best thing, is pretty much stuff like WiMAX and stuff like that.

373
00:28:49,281 --> 00:28:54,660
Speaker 0: But AT&T said, "All right, we're gonna use this thing called LTE as our fourth generation

374
00:28:55,588 --> 00:28:55,859
Speaker 0: technology.".

375
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:03,800
Speaker 0: Now, up until now, right, it's always been AT&T and T-Mobile picking this set of technologies and then Sprint and Verizon picking a different set of technologies.

376
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,360
Speaker 0: So they always have different radios.

377
00:29:06,622 --> 00:29:09,079
Speaker 0: The news is Verizon is also using LTE.

378
00:29:10,481 --> 00:29:20,243
Speaker 0: So in the future, if the LTE is, you know, gonna eventually be standardized and everyone does their thing and no one's lying and sticks to their guns, you're gonna be able to buy a phone.

379
00:29:20,264 --> 00:29:22,940
Speaker 0: that's LTE phone, which is gonna be wicked fast.

380
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,599
Speaker 0: We're talking like megabits per second data here, like crazy.

381
00:29:26,801 --> 00:29:30,699
Speaker 0: And that phone will work with pretty much any phone company in the US.

382
00:29:31,341 --> 00:29:35,384
Speaker 0: It won't be like, "Oh, my Verizon phone won't work on AT&T" or "Oh, my AT&T phone will work on

383
00:29:35,404 --> 00:29:35,798
Speaker 0: Verizon.".

384
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:48,378
Speaker 0: No, if they're both going to LTE, which they say they are for the fourth generation, and if you're in an area with 4G coverage, you're gonna be able to use your AT&T phones on the Verizon and vice versa.

385
00:29:49,524 --> 00:29:50,820
Speaker 0: And that's sort of crazy.

386
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:53,900
Speaker 0: That's like the opposite of the way it's been forever.

387
00:29:54,581 --> 00:30:02,620
Speaker 0: Like I remember when I took my parents' old Verizon phone to the mall and I was like, "Can you make this phone work?

388
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,080
Speaker 0: Like it has a Verizon sticker on it.

389
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,810
Speaker 0: You can only use it with

390
00:30:04,851 --> 00:30:05,277
Speaker 0: Verizon.".

391
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,459
Speaker 0: That's not gonna be true anymore.

392
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:08,937
Speaker 0: It's crazy times.

393
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,278
Speaker 0: Crazy times.

394
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:26,960
Speaker 0: I mean, we could reach a point where, you know, like even if Apple sticks with their crazy AT&T contract, you know, you can only buy it with AT&T, whatever, if the next iPhone is using like, you know, LTE or whatever, two iPhones from now is using LTE, that iPhone will work with anyone.

395
00:30:27,061 --> 00:30:28,400
Speaker 0: You don't want it to be sticking with anybody.

396
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,399
Speaker 0: You could do whatever you want.

397
00:30:30,141 --> 00:30:40,020
Speaker 0: And if Verizon says any phone, any app, and that includes the iPhone, you'll be able to get your crazy fast, crazy reliable coverage everywhere in New York with an iPhone.

398
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:45,032
Speaker 0: And that's like gonna be the best thing in the world, if it's real, which it might not be.

399
00:30:46,624 --> 00:30:47,699
Speaker 0: So you got anything else to say about this?

400
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:48,600
Speaker 1: Not really.

401
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,460
Speaker 1: I've been playing worms for the last several minutes.

402
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,996
Speaker 0: Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.

403
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,059
Speaker 0: But yeah, these are two huge news is going on here.

404
00:30:55,642 --> 00:30:58,371
Speaker 0: And it's kind of weird, because in the

405
00:30:58,491 --> 00:30:58,872
Speaker 0: U.S.,

406
00:30:58,912 --> 00:31:06,038
Speaker 0: we're used to when there are technology issues like these, you know, opening of cell phone networks and net neutrality or whatever, we're used to losing.

407
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,264
Speaker 0: You know, we lost in the.

408
00:31:08,605 --> 00:31:12,476
Speaker 0: what was it, the what was that court case, the...

409
00:31:14,404 --> 00:31:15,057
Speaker 1: All of them?

410
00:31:15,521 --> 00:31:18,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much, except for the one with the encryption.

411
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,235
Speaker 0: We won that one.

412
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,380
Speaker 0: But yeah, we keep losing out on, you know, everything.

413
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,480
Speaker 0: It's like we fight for something and it doesn't quite turn out the way we want it to.

414
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:28,240
Speaker 0: They pass the DMCA, they pass all these things.

415
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:33,327
Speaker 0: But here, it looks like this might be the first time things are starting to turn our way.

416
00:31:33,841 --> 00:31:41,480
Speaker 0: And if you add in, you know, DRM is starting to go away, too, with recent news of, you know, like Wal-Mart and Amazon pushing to get rid of DRMs.

417
00:31:43,282 --> 00:31:48,640
Speaker 0: It could start to be a good time for the geeks here in the U.S Finally, our day may be coming.

418
00:31:49,091 --> 00:31:49,280
Speaker 1: Right.

419
00:31:49,361 --> 00:31:51,000
Speaker 1: But I probably didn't talk too much.

420
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:51,999
Speaker 1: I was kind of busy today.

421
00:31:52,521 --> 00:31:55,039
Speaker 1: So Scott had this episode kind of all ready to go.

422
00:31:55,343 --> 00:31:56,660
Speaker 0: Well, basically, it was my news.

423
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,440
Speaker 0: It was going to be my news if we did a normal episode and it was two news combined.

424
00:32:01,101 --> 00:32:02,999
Speaker 0: And we were just going to not do a show.

425
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:06,040
Speaker 0: But I was like, oh, I've got all this stuff fresh in my mind.

426
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:10,174
Speaker 1: And when Scott told me what he wanted to do, I agreed that we really wanted to talk about this now.

427
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:12,500
Speaker 0: Because it's already sort of old.

428
00:32:12,561 --> 00:32:13,800
Speaker 0: It's news from like a few days ago.

429
00:32:13,941 --> 00:32:17,060
Speaker 0: So if I waited another week to talk about it, it would have been all stale.

430
00:32:17,311 --> 00:32:17,395
Speaker 1: Yeah.

431
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:21,180
Speaker 1: So I guess all I should say really is that this was not a normal episode of Geek Nights.

432
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,220
Speaker 1: This is what we call a Geek Nights special.

433
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,760
Speaker 1: That means we're either too lazy, too tired or too busy to do a real show.

434
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,511
Speaker 1: So we do pretty much the same thing, but without music or without all the news or maybe a main bit.

435
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,039
Speaker 0: In other words, the lazy show.

436
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:34,916
Speaker 1: Pretty much.

437
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:41,239
Speaker 1: You'd be surprised how much easier and faster it is to do a show where we don't have anything in it, but just us talking for a half hour.

438
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:42,779
Speaker 0: Incredibly easy.

439
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,239
Speaker 0: Now I'm going to go play some video games.

440
00:32:52,091 --> 00:32:54,190
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

441
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:56,810
