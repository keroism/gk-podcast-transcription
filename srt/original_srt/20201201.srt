1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,231
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, December 1st, 2020.

2
00:00:10,231 --> 00:00:10,673
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,265 --> 00:00:13,575
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,125
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,145 --> 00:00:19,080
Speaker 0: Tonight we are talking about 1817.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,680
Speaker 0: The 18xx game that doesn't have a colon and a long sentence explaining what the game is about.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,380
Speaker 0: The game from 2010.

8
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,357
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

9
00:00:30,401 --> 00:00:39,093
Speaker 1: So, uh, my original plan was that starting next Wednesday I would no longer work for the rest of the year.

10
00:00:39,294 --> 00:00:43,420
Speaker 1: until January 4th of next year I would resume working again.

11
00:00:43,721 --> 00:00:44,718
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, I remember that plan.

12
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:57,320
Speaker 1: And this is because my company, while although they dropped hints that they might do something, had not announced any change to the number of vacation days that could be carried over to next year.

13
00:00:57,903 --> 00:01:01,279
Speaker 1: And I already had carried over 10 to this year.

14
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,380
Speaker 0: Oh, so you're already pushing the envelope.

15
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,452
Speaker 1: And I could not travel anywhere, so I could not use those days for anything meaningful.

16
00:01:08,472 --> 00:01:11,540
Speaker 1: was I going to use them to stay home, which I do every day anyway, right?

17
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:18,140
Speaker 1: So, uh, I ended up, uh, being like, well, I'm going to lose these days if I don't use them.

18
00:01:18,522 --> 00:01:21,119
Speaker 1: So I used all the days I could stacked up at the end of the year.

19
00:01:22,304 --> 00:01:26,939
Speaker 1: Uh, and I took off the whole week of Thanksgiving because, whatever, that's nice anyway, right?

20
00:01:28,141 --> 00:01:30,789
Speaker 1: Uh, and then I come back from the Thanksgiving to work.

21
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,400
Speaker 1: yesterday, first day of work, and I see some announcement.

22
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,580
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, we're going to let you bring over all your days.

23
00:01:38,201 --> 00:01:38,362
Speaker 1: All?

24
00:01:38,382 --> 00:01:39,428
Speaker 1: All?

25
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,420
Speaker 0: Motherfucker, I only get to put over 10.

26
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,500
Speaker 1: So I couldn't bring over the 10 days from last year, right?

27
00:01:47,561 --> 00:01:48,177
Speaker 0: I guess that's fair.

28
00:01:49,024 --> 00:01:51,840
Speaker 1: Because, and I've already used those pretty much, right?

29
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:58,840
Speaker 0: I mean, I did, weirdly, I used a lot of vacation days this year because MagFest and PAX East did happen.

30
00:01:59,463 --> 00:02:00,359
Speaker 1: I did use those, yeah.

31
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:07,559
Speaker 1: I'm still going to take off the, my work is just automatically closed from Christmas Eve through New Year's.

32
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:12,580
Speaker 1: Uh, but I took off like this two and a half days before Christmas, right, that week.

33
00:02:12,943 --> 00:02:14,420
Speaker 1: So I kept that off, right?

34
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,658
Speaker 1: But I cancelled, I guess, you know, eight vacation days, which I will now carry over, right?

35
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,496
Speaker 1: So, um, so that's basically carrying over 18 days.

36
00:02:26,781 --> 00:02:29,700
Speaker 1: I guess I could have carried over 20, but I'm carrying over 18.

37
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,791
Speaker 1: So next year I will have 38 vacation days.

38
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,939
Speaker 1: Uh, and hopefully traveling will be legal next year and safe to do.

39
00:02:38,381 --> 00:02:42,579
Speaker 1: In which case I will do some ridiculous traveling, uh, like I have never done before.

40
00:02:44,643 --> 00:02:48,560
Speaker 1: Uh, with like a, you know, not just the conventions, but also who knows what else, right?

41
00:02:49,162 --> 00:02:50,780
Speaker 0: Maybe bike a ridiculous distance.

42
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,520
Speaker 0: Start with some like easy long weekends in like cities in Europe.

43
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could do that.

44
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,140
Speaker 1: I could see some castle.

45
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,919
Speaker 1: I could bike very, very far.

46
00:02:59,462 --> 00:03:00,257
Speaker 1: I kind of want to do that.

47
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm still planning a big long trip in Asia and like a long weekend in Paris.

48
00:03:05,063 --> 00:03:07,080
Speaker 0: And, uh, I've got the, I've got the itch.

49
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:08,138
Speaker 0: I'm finally going to do it.

50
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:20,556
Speaker 0: Uh, if I can, this left away till like 2022, probably because even if the, even if it becomes safe to travel, it will, it will, the price of traveling will skyrocket.

51
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:20,997
Speaker 0: everyone.

52
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,700
Speaker 0: Literally everyone who can afford to is like, I'm just going to spend a weekend in Paris.

53
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,059
Speaker 1: Exactly.

54
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,820
Speaker 1: We destroy the earth with some more plane exhaust, right?

55
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:33,959
Speaker 1: So that's why I was thinking, you know, do something like bike very far.

56
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:34,292
Speaker 1: Yeah.

57
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,880
Speaker 0: We're thinking about next summer biking to Rochester from New York city.

58
00:03:40,461 --> 00:03:41,099
Speaker 1: Uh, you can do that.

59
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,660
Speaker 0: Once you get up north, there's a path that's pretty long that goes west.

60
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:50,817
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's not, it's not, uh, Yeah, maybe on the road for good chunks of it until you get to the, but the Erie canal parts are really nice.

61
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:59,240
Speaker 1: There was an empire state ride, which I think was like from New York city to Buffalo that I kind of wanted to do, but it's one of those ones you had to fundraise a pile of money.

62
00:04:00,511 --> 00:04:00,659
Speaker 0: Yeah.

63
00:04:01,281 --> 00:04:02,357
Speaker 0: Or you can buy your way in.

64
00:04:03,381 --> 00:04:03,595
Speaker 1: Yeah.

65
00:04:03,962 --> 00:04:05,039
Speaker 1: Like with a pile of money.

66
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,920
Speaker 0: I mean, I remember I looked at that way back cause I was like, okay.

67
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:12,700
Speaker 0: Uh, I don't really want to like have to volunteer a whole bunch to do the New York marathon in the future.

68
00:04:12,762 --> 00:04:13,219
Speaker 0: Cause I'm busy.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,640
Speaker 0: So what would it take to just buy my way through the lottery?

70
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:17,779
Speaker 0: And it is a lot of money.

71
00:04:18,187 --> 00:04:18,480
Speaker 0: Good God.

72
00:04:18,762 --> 00:04:19,320
Speaker 0: It is a lot of money.

73
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,439
Speaker 1: There is, there is a famous ride called the rag brai, which is where you bike across the state of Iowa.

74
00:04:26,181 --> 00:04:30,360
Speaker 1: And first of all, I don't really want to go to Iowa, but also, I haven't been to Iowa.

75
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,539
Speaker 0: I think I've been to Iowa once.

76
00:04:31,681 --> 00:04:32,779
Speaker 1: I have not been to Iowa.

77
00:04:34,643 --> 00:04:36,500
Speaker 1: Um, I don't think I've been, look at my map.

78
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,660
Speaker 0: I guess I've been to Iowa.

79
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,760
Speaker 1: I guess I've been to Iowa.

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,660
Speaker 1: If I've, if this plane to Seattle flew.

81
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:40,795
Speaker 0: Nope.

82
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,860
Speaker 0: I've never been to Iowa.

83
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,360
Speaker 0: The closest I've been is Omaha, Nebraska.

84
00:04:46,144 --> 00:04:47,039
Speaker 0: It's just not that close.

85
00:04:48,845 --> 00:04:51,180
Speaker 1: Um, unless the plane went over it and that counts somehow.

86
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:52,000
Speaker 0: Yeah.

87
00:04:52,101 --> 00:04:52,968
Speaker 0: Literally the closest.

88
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:54,179
Speaker 0: I hope I was right on the edge.

89
00:04:54,964 --> 00:04:56,480
Speaker 0: I was almost in Iowa.

90
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:57,720
Speaker 0: Actually.

91
00:04:58,723 --> 00:04:59,580
Speaker 0: Might've been in Iowa.

92
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,620
Speaker 0: I got to zoom in and say edging Iowa.

93
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:01,993
Speaker 0: Nope.

94
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,520
Speaker 0: My, I was, I was edging Iowa.

95
00:05:03,923 --> 00:05:05,677
Speaker 0: I was, I never actually crossed over the border.

96
00:05:06,663 --> 00:05:08,195
Speaker 0: I was in Nebraska the entire time.

97
00:05:09,463 --> 00:05:09,737
Speaker 1: Okay.

98
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:16,919
Speaker 1: Well, you know, but that ride, uh, had some drama and I think split into two rides or something, or who knows?

99
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,700
Speaker 1: There was some, uh, I don't know what the drama was.

100
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,360
Speaker 1: I just know that there was drama and that one of the rides is good and one is bad.

101
00:05:24,301 --> 00:05:26,059
Speaker 1: One of those forks to fork.

102
00:05:26,888 --> 00:05:28,020
Speaker 0: One, two, three, four.

103
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,220
Speaker 0: I was four miles away from being in Iowa.

104
00:05:31,902 --> 00:05:36,599
Speaker 1: So yeah, I guess I'm going to be working, uh, this week, the week after that and the week after that.

105
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,997
Speaker 1: And then no more work until January 4th.

106
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:49,560
Speaker 1: So not really, not really that big a difference, but, uh, you know, the, I had some amount of planning of stuff I was going to do, uh, the rest of the year.

107
00:05:49,681 --> 00:05:52,340
Speaker 1: And I guess that will be reduced somewhat significantly.

108
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:52,777
Speaker 1: Right?

109
00:05:53,244 --> 00:05:53,353
Speaker 0: Yep.

110
00:05:53,842 --> 00:05:58,720
Speaker 0: Uh, the one thing is I pretty sure my business travel is going to pick up again, pretty hardcore after COVID.

111
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:04,979
Speaker 0: A lot of business globally has just been deferred for basically a year and let someone else pay for it.

112
00:06:05,101 --> 00:06:05,420
Speaker 1: That's fine.

113
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:05,900
Speaker 0: Yeah.

114
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:16,179
Speaker 0: Well, the only reason I mentioned that is I'm excited about it because my worry is also your worry that everyone's going to try to travel and it's going to be really hard to travel next year for a while.

115
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,240
Speaker 0: But business travel kind of doesn't worry about that.

116
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,739
Speaker 0: Like they just send you no matter what.

117
00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:25,140
Speaker 1: Well, that's, that's the thing is a business travel will not suffer.

118
00:06:25,221 --> 00:06:26,515
Speaker 1: They'll just pay and make it.

119
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:36,900
Speaker 1: And everyone who needs to fly for business will fly for business, but that will put pressure downwards on people flying for non-business making the prices higher.

120
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,639
Speaker 0: Cause like very few people, like it's like, I don't fly business class unless someone who pays for it.

121
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,039
Speaker 0: That shit is crazy expensive.

122
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:48,480
Speaker 1: But I think it's also going to put pressure from bigger businesses on smaller businesses, right?

123
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,780
Speaker 1: There are only so many first class seats and only so many flights.

124
00:06:52,281 --> 00:07:03,840
Speaker 1: I think people who are used to flying first class or are, and will be flying for business will end up having to sit in coach, uh, or you know, one of those, a lower class of seats.

125
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,617
Speaker 0: Oh, I think you're going to see a lot of that.

126
00:07:06,902 --> 00:07:18,640
Speaker 1: I know your, your big, big, big company will take up all the first class seats and then the bigger, the biggie company kind of big, we'll take up all those premium, whatever premium economy.

127
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:28,826
Speaker 0: That's the part that sucks because I will never buy business class like with my own money, because it's so ridiculous, but premium economy for a really long flight, that's like the sweet spot of.

128
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,520
Speaker 0: it's expensive, but it's just about worth it.

129
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:38,419
Speaker 0: If you get a deal as a person to pay for like flying to Australia, premium economy compared to coach, it's like night and day.

130
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:46,799
Speaker 1: It's going to be at the point where I think, you know, the seat next to the toilet that nobody wants is going to be as expensive as like premium economy used to be.

131
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,181
Speaker 0: Yep.

132
00:07:47,282 --> 00:07:50,056
Speaker 0: I think there's going to be very few cheap flights except two places.

133
00:07:50,076 --> 00:07:50,759
Speaker 0: no one wants to go.

134
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,699
Speaker 1: As soon as passports start working again and places let you in.

135
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,197
Speaker 0: You know what the secret is going to be?

136
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,720
Speaker 0: Go to places that are not popular or common tourist destinations, but that would be interesting to you.

137
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,620
Speaker 1: I think another, that's a good strategy.

138
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,580
Speaker 1: Another good strategy is to use a different method of transportation.

139
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:13,178
Speaker 0: Fly somewhere weird and then like take trains or bicycles around, do a trip.

140
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,440
Speaker 1: Or just don't use a plane in the first place.

141
00:08:15,521 --> 00:08:16,197
Speaker 1: Just use like a boat.

142
00:08:17,723 --> 00:08:18,269
Speaker 0: Not a cruise.

143
00:08:18,512 --> 00:08:19,180
Speaker 0: Don't do cruises.

144
00:08:19,962 --> 00:08:20,969
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

145
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:22,299
Speaker 1: Not a cruise.

146
00:08:22,862 --> 00:08:24,394
Speaker 0: I would do Amtrak across America.

147
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:24,918
Speaker 0: That could be fun.

148
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,555
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, any kind of alternative thing.

149
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,780
Speaker 0: You know, my biggest regret in my entire like working life was way back.

150
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,919
Speaker 0: I did this really, really long, I did like this three week business trip all over Europe for like just a bunch of stuff.

151
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:44,480
Speaker 0: Like I put, I took all my business travel I normally do over the course of like a quarter and I got my company to agree to let me just do it all in one long trip.

152
00:08:45,643 --> 00:08:48,400
Speaker 1: But then again, also, right, not just like the downward pressure.

153
00:08:48,480 --> 00:09:00,700
Speaker 0: But the point was I had the opportunity, instead of flying from Germany to Istanbul and making some stops along the way, I thought about taking the like the literal Orient Express.

154
00:09:01,701 --> 00:09:02,316
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could do that.

155
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,760
Speaker 0: But it ended up being too expensive and way too far out of the way.

156
00:09:06,682 --> 00:09:11,060
Speaker 1: But just like this downward pressure going to be on the cheaper, you know, plane seats.

157
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:22,900
Speaker 1: That's, you know, the whole industry is going to have, you know, price pressure in terms of like, oh, OK, well, you can't go to Disney World because everyone who's already going there, it's full now because we can finally go there safely.

158
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,920
Speaker 1: Disney World is full.

159
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,080
Speaker 0: Dude, Cedar Point is already selling season tickets for post COVID times and they're already selling out.

160
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:30,960
Speaker 0: People are making reservations.

161
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,397
Speaker 1: Six Flags is going to be full too.

162
00:09:32,621 --> 00:09:32,747
Speaker 1: Yep.

163
00:09:34,904 --> 00:09:36,460
Speaker 0: Got to go off the beaten path a little bit.

164
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,700
Speaker 1: I feel like you got to have to go off a lot because the other people are going to be pushed off the beaten path as well.

165
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:48,760
Speaker 0: I feel like the PAX's that haven't sold out for a while are going to sell out so hard when they can happen.

166
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:49,280
Speaker 1: Could be.

167
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:49,890
Speaker 1: Could be.

168
00:09:50,721 --> 00:09:55,104
Speaker 0: I think it's going to be trouble to get hotels for PAX East 2022.

169
00:09:55,104 --> 00:09:55,780
Speaker 1: I mean, probably.

170
00:09:56,661 --> 00:09:59,360
Speaker 0: I mean, it's already trouble in non-COVID times to get hotels for that kind.

171
00:09:59,602 --> 00:10:01,240
Speaker 0: All right.

172
00:10:01,926 --> 00:10:02,799
Speaker 0: So gaming news.

173
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,988
Speaker 0: This is such a small thing, but it's such a big deal because it's like.

174
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:15,200
Speaker 0: this is an example of a user experience improvement that is just great for everyone and obvious in retrospect.

175
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,839
Speaker 0: And I can't I don't know why I'm surprised that Nintendo did something like this.

176
00:10:20,361 --> 00:10:20,943
Speaker 1: Well, no, I'm.

177
00:10:21,505 --> 00:10:24,475
Speaker 1: basically the news is one of those things where it's.

178
00:10:24,656 --> 00:10:25,840
Speaker 1: it's almost like a bad news.

179
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:28,040
Speaker 1: It's not, yay, you finally did this.

180
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:28,618
Speaker 1: It's boo.

181
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,920
Speaker 1: Why were you so stupid that you didn't do this until now?

182
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,478
Speaker 1: You suck.

183
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,019
Speaker 1: Well, that it took you this long.

184
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:34,638
Speaker 0: I'm annoyed.

185
00:10:35,141 --> 00:10:39,940
Speaker 0: One, my Switch should just be able to like send files to arbitrary places like I should be there.

186
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,720
Speaker 0: I should be able to tweet directly from the Switch.

187
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:48,580
Speaker 0: I should be able to just like, yeah, hit a button and have the pictures appear in like my Nintendo account to download.

188
00:10:50,261 --> 00:10:57,860
Speaker 1: But, yeah, so the way the Nintendo Switch has on it a physical button on the left controller to take screenshots and video.

189
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,979
Speaker 1: It's a built in feature so much that has its own goddamn button.

190
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:15,920
Speaker 1: But until until just like yesterday, the only way to get those screenshots and videos off of the Switch and onto the Internet where you would share them is the Switch itself had some automatic sharing functionalities.

191
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,340
Speaker 1: You could connect your Switch to, say, Twitter to automatically tweet your photos and videos straight from the Switch.

192
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,800
Speaker 1: You usually don't want to do that.

193
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:28,860
Speaker 1: You want to edit it or do something else to it first or, you know, share it on a service that's not supported by the Switch.

194
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,080
Speaker 0: And also there it was not configurable enough or usable enough.

195
00:11:34,392 --> 00:11:34,560
Speaker 1: Yeah.

196
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:40,800
Speaker 1: And then the other thing you could do is, you know, the Switch does have an SD card hidden under the little like T-Stand thing.

197
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:41,252
Speaker 1: Right.

198
00:11:42,081 --> 00:11:54,960
Speaker 1: You could take the SD card out, put it in your computer or an SD card reader and read the read the the images off of it as if the Switch was a camera and it was just photos that the Switch took.

199
00:11:56,552 --> 00:11:57,220
Speaker 1: So that works.

200
00:11:57,321 --> 00:12:00,180
Speaker 1: But it's a hassle because a micro SD hiding under the Switch.

201
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,760
Speaker 1: You got to take a switch out of the dock, go to the computer, drag and drop, put it back in the Switch.

202
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:05,922
Speaker 1: It's not.

203
00:12:06,003 --> 00:12:08,159
Speaker 1: it's not a good experience to do it that way.

204
00:12:08,941 --> 00:12:17,620
Speaker 1: I mean, even when I have a camera where the SD card is much more accessible, I will frequently just plug the camera in with the USB cable because it's easier to take the cards out.

205
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:26,690
Speaker 1: So what they did is they made a firmware update to the Switch to do something that should have been there on day one, which is a you can't.

206
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:31,616
Speaker 1: there's a complicated garbage procedure where you can get photos off of the Switch by taking.

207
00:12:31,636 --> 00:12:34,280
Speaker 1: it'll display a QR code on the Switch.

208
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,460
Speaker 1: You take a photo of that with your camera and then that'll help you get the photos from the Switch to your phone.

209
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:47,620
Speaker 1: And two, the smart thing, you can now just plug your Switch in with USB cable to your computer and get the photos off.

210
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,378
Speaker 0: Oh, I didn't notice that part.

211
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:50,140
Speaker 1: That's just obvious.

212
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,519
Speaker 1: It's like that's what should have been there.

213
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,180
Speaker 1: It's like why did this take so long?

214
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,700
Speaker 0: That's so much better because it's so fiddly to get that stupid SD card out.

215
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:56,480
Speaker 1: Right.

216
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,460
Speaker 1: It's like you just plug your Switch into your computer with the cable.

217
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:58,791
Speaker 1: Boom.

218
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,440
Speaker 1: Download the files right off there.

219
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:00,700
Speaker 1: Done.

220
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,084
Speaker 1: It took.

221
00:13:02,205 --> 00:13:03,440
Speaker 1: how long has the Switch been around?

222
00:13:03,502 --> 00:13:04,220
Speaker 1: Two or three years?

223
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,080
Speaker 0: That's what I was getting at.

224
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:11,520
Speaker 0: This is such a good UX improvement, but it only was an improvement because Nintendo Nintendo'd for so long.

225
00:13:12,142 --> 00:13:12,320
Speaker 1: Right.

226
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:16,480
Speaker 1: They're trash for how many years with this awful functionality.

227
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,240
Speaker 0: But at least we're at a saturation point where pretty much anyone who has a Switch has a smartphone.

228
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:25,120
Speaker 0: Like even kids have smartphones.

229
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,560
Speaker 0: So I think it seems like it just works.

230
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:33,420
Speaker 1: I mean, that's why they, you know, I mean Switch still has the stupid thing where if you want to do voice chat in a Switch game, you have to open up the separate app to do it.

231
00:13:34,603 --> 00:13:36,539
Speaker 1: It does work, but you know.

232
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,040
Speaker 0: Yep.

233
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,900
Speaker 0: I've never tried it and I doubt I ever will.

234
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,479
Speaker 1: I've used it one time.

235
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:47,240
Speaker 1: It worked nicely, but it's still, you know, it's like you're going to be on your phone while you're playing your Switch.

236
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:56,700
Speaker 0: So in some other news, Super Mario Maker is not going to let you upload levels anymore in 2021.

237
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:56,769
Speaker 1: Yep.

238
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,620
Speaker 1: So this is, I just wanted to bring this up.

239
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,940
Speaker 1: You know, it's sort of obvious, right?

240
00:14:00,141 --> 00:14:02,757
Speaker 1: The Wii shop died a while ago, right?

241
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,899
Speaker 1: I'm sure the 3DS shop is probably coming soon.

242
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,420
Speaker 1: It's going to die at some point.

243
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,077
Speaker 1: Get ready.

244
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:20,540
Speaker 1: And at the Wii U, which no one bought Wii U's, the sales, go look at the sales numbers of Wii U versus Switch and it'll really put things in perspective for you how awful the Wii U sold and how almost no one has one.

245
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:28,720
Speaker 1: But they're going to shut down the online Mario Maker features for the Wii U original Mario Maker, not Mario Maker 2. that's on your Switch.

246
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,839
Speaker 1: That's still going strong.

247
00:14:30,361 --> 00:14:38,276
Speaker 1: But one day, yeah, the Switch ones are going to shut down too in like 2030 or some, you know, close, probably not even 2030, maybe 2027, 28, something like that, right?

248
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:42,300
Speaker 1: At the rate, the pace we're going.

249
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:51,000
Speaker 1: And this is why if a game is available on PC and you have a PC, which you should have, you should get it on PC.

250
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:56,860
Speaker 0: Unless you are willing to just accept the fact that that game will one day disappear and you'll never be able to play it again.

251
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:57,915
Speaker 1: Yep.

252
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,099
Speaker 0: Your save game will be gone.

253
00:15:00,061 --> 00:15:00,361
Speaker 1: Yep.

254
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:01,464
Speaker 1: PC stuff, yeah.

255
00:15:01,504 --> 00:15:07,640
Speaker 1: Sometimes online services for MMOs and stuff go down, but, you know, people find a way on PC.

256
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,100
Speaker 1: If it's an EXE, people can somehow find a way.

257
00:15:11,581 --> 00:15:19,820
Speaker 0: There's an EXE file where you can make Tribes 2 work and there's another EXE file that basically fakes all the servers necessary to make Tribes 2 work.

258
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:25,340
Speaker 0: And I just found that website, not only is it still up, but someone posted there as recently as last May.

259
00:15:26,281 --> 00:15:26,441
Speaker 1: Yep.

260
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:33,080
Speaker 1: So, yeah, Mario Maker is pretty much like it's, you know, as soon as that server goes down, it's like, that's it.

261
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:39,920
Speaker 1: There's like all those Mario Maker 1 levels are just going to be like lost to the archives of Nintendo.

262
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,318
Speaker 0: Like tears in the rain.

263
00:15:42,561 --> 00:15:46,280
Speaker 1: Well, I think they're going to remove, I think, just the functionality to upload new levels.

264
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, but how are you going to download them and play them?

265
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,141
Speaker 1: Right.

266
00:15:50,201 --> 00:15:54,740
Speaker 1: But yeah, the downloading functionality is, I guess, still going to be there for now, I think.

267
00:15:54,981 --> 00:15:59,180
Speaker 0: Well, Super Mario Maker itself will disappear from the eShop entirely in January.

268
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:00,340
Speaker 1: Yep.

269
00:16:00,862 --> 00:16:02,908
Speaker 1: And so it's like, if you can't download more, like.

270
00:16:02,948 --> 00:16:06,780
Speaker 1: the whole thing is just like, it's like, wow, people put all that work into all those levels.

271
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,179
Speaker 1: And there's like, there's such a, you know, huge amount of content there.

272
00:16:10,661 --> 00:16:14,760
Speaker 1: And even if Nintendo keeps backups somewhere, it's like, wow, that'll just be lost.

273
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,121
Speaker 0: Yep.

274
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:17,009
Speaker 0: I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.

275
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:19,540
Speaker 0: Bullet bills off the shoulder of Bowser's castle.

276
00:16:20,701 --> 00:16:20,962
Speaker 1: Right.

277
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:26,020
Speaker 1: But it's like, you know, not all those levels are meaningful, but there's a lot of work that went into a lot of levels.

278
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,940
Speaker 1: And if you don't have them like saved to your Wii U in advance, like those will be the only levels that you'll be able to play.

279
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,899
Speaker 1: You won't be able to get any more than anyone else has worked on.

280
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:35,806
Speaker 0: Yeah.

281
00:16:35,826 --> 00:16:36,818
Speaker 0: But also, unlike say...

282
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:43,160
Speaker 1: The Mario Maker 2, the Mario Maker 2 database of levels is even bigger, even more enormous, right?

283
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,760
Speaker 1: So many more copies sold, I presume, because the Switch sold better.

284
00:16:47,564 --> 00:16:50,337
Speaker 1: When those are lost, that'll be a real damn shame, right?

285
00:16:50,457 --> 00:16:50,920
Speaker 1: You know, so...

286
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:58,560
Speaker 0: But even worse, if someone tries to hack something together to make it work, Nintendo is not known for letting fans do anything.

287
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,380
Speaker 0: Like, Nintendo shut down that Smash tournament a little while ago.

288
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:17,398
Speaker 1: And even if you did get, even if you were able to make a perfect Mario Maker server and use DNS to trick your Wii U into connecting to that instead, and it worked 100% identically to the original one, you know, that was perfect in every way, you don't have all those levels that got made.

289
00:17:17,681 --> 00:17:21,180
Speaker 0: Unless you're hacking this now and you're downloading all these levels somehow.

290
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,680
Speaker 1: You would have to hack into Nintendo's server and steal all the levels.

291
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:31,420
Speaker 1: Even if you have a legal copy of the game, you can only download so many levels via their APIs or whatever.

292
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:31,961
Speaker 0: Yep.

293
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,460
Speaker 0: And everyone likes to throttle APIs lately.

294
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,957
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day!

295
00:17:42,977 --> 00:17:43,359
Speaker 0: What do you got?

296
00:17:44,721 --> 00:17:49,760
Speaker 1: Alright, so, you know, just a talented jazz musician, right?

297
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,480
Speaker 1: This woman from Sweden named Gunhild Carling, right?

298
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:58,499
Speaker 1: You know, a jazz musician, among other things.

299
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,704
Speaker 1: Vintage music and fashion.

300
00:18:00,725 --> 00:18:04,539
Speaker 1: If you go to their website, gunhildcarling.net, they got a whole bunch of content posted.

301
00:18:05,421 --> 00:18:08,740
Speaker 1: This is like 159 pages of content, and they're updating frequently.

302
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:11,275
Speaker 1: It's like, the latest post is November 27th of this year.

303
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,460
Speaker 1: You know, some live performance on a YouTube channel, right?

304
00:18:16,581 --> 00:18:24,500
Speaker 1: But, on Twitter, a video of Gunhild Carling went around and was much retweeted, with good reason.

305
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:48,080
Speaker 1: But my thing of the day is, the original YouTube video that Twitter was taken from, because the Twitter video is only a minute something long, the full video is three minutes something long, here's a performance, I think for 2014, in Central Park, by Gunhild, playing some hot swing jazz music on a bagpipe.

306
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,259
Speaker 1: And that is not something I've seen before in my entire life.

307
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,320
Speaker 1: That's why it got so many retweets, and that's why you should check it out.

308
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,060
Speaker 1: I've only ever heard bagpipe music from a bagpipe.

309
00:18:59,581 --> 00:19:01,000
Speaker 0: That is pretty cool.

310
00:19:01,962 --> 00:19:06,659
Speaker 1: I want to hear, you know, I bet there's metal bagpipes, if I search for them, they're going to be there, right?

311
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:11,620
Speaker 0: I mean, the drone feels like a drone would fit right in with some background.

312
00:19:11,761 --> 00:19:15,640
Speaker 1: There's a 1000% chance there was already metal bagpipe music, right?

313
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,460
Speaker 1: I would never bet against that, not even one penny.

314
00:19:20,363 --> 00:19:22,140
Speaker 0: The next step is we need bagpipe wave.

315
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:30,795
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I imagine there are some genres of music the bagpipe has not hit on with yet, but jazz is not one of them.

316
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:45,880
Speaker 0: So, my thing of the day is a very simple website, and it covers the entirety of the United States of America and Canada, and also much of the UK and almost all of Germany.

317
00:19:46,661 --> 00:19:48,959
Speaker 0: This website will do one thing.

318
00:19:49,441 --> 00:19:58,480
Speaker 0: You can look at any McDonald's in any of those places, anywhere, and know, right now, in real time, if their ice cream maker is broken or not.

319
00:19:59,521 --> 00:20:01,011
Speaker 1: Well, how are they getting this information?

320
00:20:01,071 --> 00:20:02,420
Speaker 1: It's supposed to be crowdsourced, right?

321
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:04,300
Speaker 0: So, that is the coolest thing.

322
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,620
Speaker 1: You go into a McDonald's, you try to order ice cream, it's not working, you report it to this website.

323
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:23,740
Speaker 0: So, this website, the way it works is, Rashik, the individual who made it, reverse engineered a McDonald's internal API, and then set up an app that makes an order.

324
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:37,960
Speaker 0: It spends, well, it attempts to spend $18,752 every minute by buying one small ice cream cone at every McDonald's on earth to see if it'll let you put it in the cart.

325
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:45,439
Speaker 0: And if it doesn't let you put it in the cart, then it knows that the machine is broken, and then it decides not to.

326
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,338
Speaker 1: Or they don't have one.

327
00:20:47,563 --> 00:20:56,820
Speaker 0: He talks a little more about how they actually do it, but basically, you can infer whether or not the ice cream machine is working from the way the cart works.

328
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,131
Speaker 1: What if a new McDonald's opens up?

329
00:20:59,171 --> 00:21:00,220
Speaker 1: Does it, like, update his shit?

330
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:00,632
Speaker 0: Yes.

331
00:21:01,784 --> 00:21:01,891
Speaker 1: Okay.

332
00:21:03,441 --> 00:21:15,798
Speaker 0: So, he goes and tries to buy one ice cream from every McDonald's in America, and then closes that out of his cart instead of buying it every minute of every hour of every day to make this website work.

333
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,960
Speaker 1: And McDonald's doesn't notice or care?

334
00:21:18,947 --> 00:21:19,579
Speaker 0: I guess not.

335
00:21:21,262 --> 00:21:25,057
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess they could try to block his IP from buying things from McDonald's.

336
00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:26,300
Speaker 1: Sure.

337
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,160
Speaker 0: But they seem to have not caught on, or if they've caught on, they don't care.

338
00:21:30,942 --> 00:21:32,460
Speaker 0: And this website just works.

339
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:37,600
Speaker 0: And I'm zooming in right now, and I can see that there's almost no McDonald's anywhere near me, thankfully.

340
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,405
Speaker 1: Yeah, there is.

341
00:21:38,446 --> 00:21:39,215
Speaker 1: There's one on 21st Street.

342
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,079
Speaker 0: That's a bit of a ways away.

343
00:21:42,641 --> 00:21:44,051
Speaker 1: There's one on the train, on Broadway.

344
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:45,823
Speaker 0: Yep, I see it.

345
00:21:45,884 --> 00:21:46,850
Speaker 0: Broadway at 31st.

346
00:21:46,911 --> 00:21:47,434
Speaker 0: I see that one.

347
00:21:47,454 --> 00:21:48,320
Speaker 0: The ice cream machine there.

348
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:48,863
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's that one.

349
00:21:48,883 --> 00:21:51,600
Speaker 1: Because I always look out the train window and you can see the play place in there.

350
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,084
Speaker 0: They checked it.

351
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,700
Speaker 0: The ice cream machine there is currently working.

352
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:54,815
Speaker 1: Okay.

353
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:59,836
Speaker 0: Oh, but the one across the Queensborough Ridge, and then down at 50th Street?

354
00:22:00,177 --> 00:22:01,019
Speaker 0: No ice cream right now.

355
00:22:02,107 --> 00:22:02,320
Speaker 1: Uh-oh.

356
00:22:05,521 --> 00:22:09,620
Speaker 0: So, in about a moment, I did not get the Hanzo signal.

357
00:22:10,686 --> 00:22:11,478
Speaker 1: And neither did I.

358
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,458
Speaker 0: So, we're not reading the Tale of the Engi yet.

359
00:22:14,482 --> 00:22:16,600
Speaker 1: I am reading some Adventure Time comics, I guess.

360
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:21,380
Speaker 0: Yep, I'm reading some non-fiction about elections and political machines.

361
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:22,818
Speaker 1: It's a little late for that.

362
00:22:23,602 --> 00:22:25,591
Speaker 0: Not yet, because the Georgia Senate runoff is happening.

363
00:22:28,542 --> 00:22:29,954
Speaker 1: I'm sure that book will help turn the tide.

364
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:30,900
Speaker 1: But

365
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:46,860
Speaker 0: what the book is about, I'll talk about it later, but the book's interesting because it's basically a current modern poli-sci take on the difference between people who follow politics and are very well informed about it, versus the people who follow politics are very well informed about it and do something other than just sending money.

366
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:53,320
Speaker 0: Like, how do you get directly involved and actually make a difference in the current political machines?

367
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,904
Speaker 0: Not counting.

368
00:22:54,944 --> 00:22:57,760
Speaker 0: The problem is, you know what it doesn't cover, kind of specifically?

369
00:22:58,781 --> 00:23:03,360
Speaker 0: New York politics, because New York politics is a completely different world from, like, most other American politics.

370
00:23:03,641 --> 00:23:06,617
Speaker 0: And none of the things that apply anywhere else actually matter here.

371
00:23:09,161 --> 00:23:10,827
Speaker 0: Like, I talk about the political machine.

372
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:14,500
Speaker 0: New York politics is more like a modern Tammany Hall.

373
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:23,920
Speaker 0: Like, there is a political machine, and you have to spend your entire life getting, like, sucked into that machine, and then one day, when you're old, they'll let you pull one of the levers.

374
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:25,600
Speaker 1: I'm aware.

375
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:31,540
Speaker 0: So, this won't apply to us getting involved in, like, Queens politics, but it might apply to, like, the rest of the country.

376
00:23:32,381 --> 00:23:33,266
Speaker 0: It's interesting stuff.

377
00:23:33,426 --> 00:23:36,200
Speaker 0: It's stuff I don't know a lot about, like that level of politics.

378
00:23:37,861 --> 00:23:39,495
Speaker 0: But I'm not reading the Tale of Genji.

379
00:23:39,556 --> 00:23:40,000
Speaker 0: as a result.

380
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,745
Speaker 0: We got no-cons coming up.

381
00:23:41,945 --> 00:23:44,898
Speaker 0: There's talk of the online magfest.

382
00:23:44,998 --> 00:23:45,400
Speaker 0: Stay tuned.

383
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,919
Speaker 0: We will be involved in that in as many capacities as we can.

384
00:23:49,381 --> 00:23:50,170
Speaker 0: They have our sword.

385
00:23:50,211 --> 00:23:50,940
Speaker 0: We'll see how it goes.

386
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,540
Speaker 0: And otherwise, we're just trying to make stuff.

387
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,788
Speaker 0: Follow our YouTube channels.

388
00:23:54,888 --> 00:23:55,694
Speaker 0: Scott's making stuff.

389
00:23:55,755 --> 00:23:56,359
Speaker 0: I'm making stuff.

390
00:23:58,381 --> 00:24:03,640
Speaker 0: I had an idea on how to make the Utena show quicker, and I rewatched the next episode.

391
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,250
Speaker 0: Do you know what the next episode is?

392
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,780
Speaker 0: A full-on Black Rose duel.

393
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:07,912
Speaker 1: It's a Black Rose episode.

394
00:24:07,953 --> 00:24:08,480
Speaker 1: I know that much.

395
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,840
Speaker 0: It's the jury duel in Black Rose.

396
00:24:11,866 --> 00:24:12,058
Speaker 1: Okay.

397
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,760
Speaker 0: 'Cause the episode we last did was an Anami episode.

398
00:24:17,241 --> 00:24:19,659
Speaker 1: I forget if she fights the dude or the girl.

399
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:23,050
Speaker 0: This is the--no, the dude's not in yet.

400
00:24:23,091 --> 00:24:24,580
Speaker 0: The dude is in the final arc with the Kars.

401
00:24:25,781 --> 00:24:27,046
Speaker 0: Ruka does not come back.

402
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:30,519
Speaker 0: This is phase two of the jury story arc.

403
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:33,907
Speaker 0: But I watched the episode again.

404
00:24:33,968 --> 00:24:35,380
Speaker 0: It was real good, and I took some notes.

405
00:24:35,881 --> 00:24:44,098
Speaker 0: And maybe we'll talk later about how we will do a show about it, maybe without having to do the full production that we do for a panel, 'cause that's a pain in the ass.

406
00:24:45,785 --> 00:24:46,336
Speaker 0: We'll figure it out.

407
00:24:47,902 --> 00:24:49,859
Speaker 0: That's all I really got, meta-moment-wise.

408
00:24:51,161 --> 00:24:52,533
Speaker 1: Yeah, come find us on the internet.

409
00:24:52,553 --> 00:24:53,280
Speaker 1: We're around.

410
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,257
Speaker 1: We got forums, we got discords, we got all kinds of stuff.

411
00:24:56,297 --> 00:24:56,760
Speaker 1: Talk to us.

412
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:57,181
Speaker 0: Yep.

413
00:24:57,702 --> 00:25:02,860
Speaker 0: So, we've done several shows on 18XX Games, and we stopped doing shows.

414
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,309
Speaker 0: We've played more of them.

415
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:09,440
Speaker 0: We haven't reviewed them all, because we don't want to turn gig nights into just the 18XX Games podcast.

416
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:13,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, there seems to be a lot of things that we like that have serieses, right?

417
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:22,281
Speaker 1: And, you know, you could make an entire podcast about, say-- I mean, recently we were talking about Jackbox Games, 'cause a new one just came out, Jackbox 7.

418
00:25:22,281 --> 00:25:25,540
Speaker 0: And there's, like, game design stuff to say about every Jackbox that came out.

419
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's like, they come out with a Jackbox every October.

420
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:38,618
Speaker 1: That's one--if we were to do a Jackbox episode every year about the new one that just came out, that's one--we only do a Tuesday show every other week, there's 52 weeks in a year.

421
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:46,595
Speaker 1: That would be one 26th--every 26th Tuesday Geek Nights gaming episode would be about Jackbox, leaving only 25 for other things.

422
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,780
Speaker 1: Like, we can't just keep doing every episode about the same damn thing.

423
00:25:51,001 --> 00:25:57,550
Speaker 0: The problem is, COVID means we're playing games that are easy to play during COVID, and what's very easy to play?

424
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:58,115
Speaker 0: 18XX Games.

425
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:04,980
Speaker 1: Right, so, you know, we already did two or three shows on 18XX Games.

426
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,160
Speaker 1: What would possibly justify us doing yet another one?

427
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,220
Speaker 1: Hopefully the last one, unless a really revolutionary one comes out sometime.

428
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:28,740
Speaker 1: But 1817, the one we were talking about today, is dramatically different from the other 18XX Games, in that the way the stock market works is basically more fully featured.

429
00:26:29,702 --> 00:26:32,200
Speaker 1: It's not just buy and sell, the end.

430
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:43,780
Speaker 1: It's buy, sell, short, merge, acquisition, friendly acquisition, loans, interest, paying off loans, hostile takeovers, liquidations.

431
00:26:44,342 --> 00:26:51,420
Speaker 0: And it materially changed my relationship with 18XX Games, and we'll review the whole game.

432
00:26:52,263 --> 00:27:08,799
Speaker 1: I knew about this one in the past, because A, it's the New York one, because it's called 1817 because 1817 is the year the New York Stock Exchange formed, as opposed to the year being related to trains or anything like that.

433
00:27:10,245 --> 00:27:16,160
Speaker 1: So the game, it's actually a lot less focused on the train action, and much more focused on the stock action.

434
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,920
Speaker 1: The train action, it's like those unlimited tiles.

435
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:31,560
Speaker 0: The train action changes the values of tokens and things for acquisition, but it also is just information that you use in the course of deciding how to invest and manage the company.

436
00:27:32,842 --> 00:27:33,820
Speaker 0: It's like context for that.

437
00:27:34,284 --> 00:27:35,600
Speaker 1: It's all about stocks and stuff.

438
00:27:35,902 --> 00:27:39,051
Speaker 1: I knew that it had short selling, which the other ones didn't have, and I was like,

439
00:27:39,112 --> 00:27:39,418
Speaker 1: "Ooh.".

440
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:46,900
Speaker 1: But when you think about it, the huge list of things you can do, it's like, man, 18XX is already scary to some people.

441
00:27:47,241 --> 00:27:49,400
Speaker 1: This one's got to be extra scary to some people.

442
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,380
Speaker 0: It would be to a point.

443
00:27:51,183 --> 00:27:53,640
Speaker 0: This is not your first 18XX game.

444
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,640
Speaker 0: You will not enjoy it if you've never played one of these games before.

445
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:02,560
Speaker 1: Well, you might if you are the kind of person who can play a complicated game.

446
00:28:04,782 --> 00:28:16,140
Speaker 0: The trouble you have is that it's very difficult to learn this game if you don't have the context of 18XX games, because for us, all we had to look at were what's different.

447
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,700
Speaker 0: And that really increased our enjoyment.

448
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,539
Speaker 0: We can engage with it with fewer plays.

449
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,320
Speaker 0: We had to play it one and a half times to review it.

450
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:27,720
Speaker 1: Playing it on the computer matters more than anything.

451
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,179
Speaker 1: I'm looking at a photo on BoardGame.

452
00:28:29,963 --> 00:28:32,260
Speaker 0: I don't think I would ever want to play this one physically.

453
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:37,580
Speaker 1: Of people playing this in person with chips and boards all over the place.

454
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,319
Speaker 0: It's an eclipse on the table.

455
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,079
Speaker 1: It's even worse.

456
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,280
Speaker 1: It's like a disaster.

457
00:28:43,843 --> 00:28:46,520
Speaker 1: People say it takes six, seven hours to play this.

458
00:28:47,161 --> 00:28:53,120
Speaker 1: I believe you, if you're playing this in person, there are some things that might actually go faster than playing it online.

459
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,359
Speaker 0: Like mergers and acquisitions.

460
00:28:54,821 --> 00:28:55,419
Speaker 1: Is anyone merging?

461
00:28:55,582 --> 00:28:56,480
Speaker 1: Okay, no, whatever.

462
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,439
Speaker 1: You can just skip that.

463
00:28:58,181 --> 00:29:00,560
Speaker 1: And online, you have to wait for everyone to click the pass button.

464
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:04,940
Speaker 0: But alright, now there's 12 train companies because people IPO'd like crazy.

465
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,580
Speaker 1: The busy work involved in playing this game in person is just enormous.

466
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:19,400
Speaker 1: The rule book is actually hard to read because I'm playing it online, but a lot of the stuff in the rule book actually describes what to do with the physical pieces in the game.

467
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,199
Speaker 1: And I don't need that.

468
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,400
Speaker 1: All I need to know is how the system works of the game.

469
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,840
Speaker 1: I don't need to know the physical pieces because I'm playing online.

470
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:33,080
Speaker 0: But the design is elegant in that the physical system, like the physical pieces do completely encapsulate the system.

471
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,240
Speaker 0: And if you have those physical components, it does offload that from your brain elegantly.

472
00:29:37,341 --> 00:29:40,820
Speaker 0: But if you don't have those physical components, nothing explains the mechanic.

473
00:29:41,927 --> 00:29:42,560
Speaker 1: Yep, exactly.

474
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:54,680
Speaker 1: So, but yeah, so what is the thing is as scary as it is, right, without all the short selling, merging, buying, liquidating, all that stuff, you know, you think it's complicated.

475
00:29:55,303 --> 00:29:58,800
Speaker 1: But it took me one game to sort of figure it out.

476
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:04,200
Speaker 1: Reading the rules, I read them over several times and I didn't really grasp it until we played once.

477
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,258
Speaker 1: Now I fully grasp it.

478
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:05,711
Speaker 1: Yep.

479
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:06,967
Speaker 1: At least 90% plus grasp.

480
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:18,500
Speaker 0: Part of the way I grasped it was because I could do things like click merger, look at what happened, and decide, oh, that's a terrible idea, and hit undo.

481
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,560
Speaker 1: That's exactly what I did in the first game.

482
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,780
Speaker 1: To do that with physical components.

483
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,819
Speaker 1: I was merging, undoing, converting, undoing.

484
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,400
Speaker 0: That would literally be, all right, everyone, go take a break.

485
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:34,320
Speaker 0: Rym's going to calculate the valuation of his company for the next 10 minutes and decide which of these three paths to follow.

486
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,680
Speaker 1: But playing online asynchronously, no one's got to wait, so it's pretty awesome.

487
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:52,940
Speaker 0: But the TLDR of the why we're talking about this game is that these changes together, which we'll get into in detail, like why and how, they give agency to the players over the parts of the game that rankle us the most.

488
00:30:53,322 --> 00:31:11,360
Speaker 0: In all the other 18xx games, even though they're simpler, they have this fundamental problem that there will be one part of the game, usually player order, but sometimes it's something slightly different, where you have almost no control over that order, yet that order determines whether or not you even have agency at key points in the game.

489
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:38,160
Speaker 0: In this game, there are many ways to manipulate that player order, more ways than in the other games, so as a result, you have more opportunities to do the crazy things that often only happen once or twice in the other 18xx games, to the point to where in 1846, if I have the opportunity to rust a train onto someone, I'm fucking doing it, because how rare is it that I have that opportunity?

490
00:31:39,341 --> 00:31:42,800
Speaker 0: But in this game, I have the opportunity to do crazy stuff every round.

491
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,559
Speaker 0: The question is, do I want to do the crazy thing?

492
00:31:46,801 --> 00:31:50,500
Speaker 0: That alone makes this game my favorite 18xx game already.

493
00:31:51,962 --> 00:32:00,712
Speaker 0: And the listener in the stream already, when we said, "Oh, we're talking about 18x, 1817," Guy DotA immediately said, "1817 is the best 18xx.

494
00:32:01,014 --> 00:32:02,379
Speaker 0: All I do is eat, sleep, and think about

495
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:05,321
Speaker 0: 1817.".

496
00:32:05,321 --> 00:32:10,460
Speaker 1: I mean, even though I've only played it once in a part time so far...

497
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,799
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're in the middle of another second game of it right now.

498
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:13,601
Speaker 1: Right.

499
00:32:14,105 --> 00:32:15,071
Speaker 1: It is very great.

500
00:32:15,152 --> 00:32:21,559
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's... I can't say it's too soon for me to say it's the best, but I can see how you could say it's the best.

501
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,520
Speaker 0: It's my favorite.

502
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,500
Speaker 1: It has the potential to be the best.

503
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:33,879
Speaker 0: I saw complex strategies that I think I could execute that I did not need to execute, because all of us playing are at about the same level of befuddlement, in terms of how to be good at this game.

504
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:46,277
Speaker 0: But I had a great time with it, and at no point did I feel... Every time there was a problem, like in the other 18xx games, very commonly, Mira Scott will say something like, "Well, I had no control over that, and now I'm

505
00:32:46,317 --> 00:32:46,599
Speaker 0: boned.".

506
00:32:46,861 --> 00:32:50,680
Speaker 0: And it's still fun, but I recognize the point after which I had no more agency.

507
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,760
Speaker 0: In this game, agency lasted for a long time for most of the players.

508
00:32:57,861 --> 00:32:59,988
Speaker 1: Yup.

509
00:33:00,008 --> 00:33:01,172
Speaker 1: That's always my number.

510
00:33:01,253 --> 00:33:02,537
Speaker 1: one thing that makes me mad.

511
00:33:02,597 --> 00:33:19,030
Speaker 1: at any game, is if there is a time at which any player, especially me, but any player, is not eliminated from the game, cannot win, but even worse than cannot win, is cannot do anything, take any more meaningful actions.

512
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:19,680
Speaker 1: Yup.

513
00:33:21,608 --> 00:33:22,780
Speaker 1: That you can't even king make.

514
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,900
Speaker 1: It's like you have no power in the game whatsoever.

515
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:28,000
Speaker 1: You can't buy a stock, you can't sell one, you can't buy a train.

516
00:33:28,902 --> 00:33:33,800
Speaker 1: Nothing is in your control, you have no decisions left, but you are still here, and you are technically still playing.

517
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,879
Speaker 0: Yup, you've got like one token doff company.

518
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,417
Speaker 0: You've got three shares in the presidency, and one token doff company with a five train and no cash.

519
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:42,538
Speaker 0: Like, great.

520
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:46,320
Speaker 1: Right, in 1817, if that happens, you'll go bankrupt.

521
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,108
Speaker 0: Yup.

522
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:51,040
Speaker 1: And you won't be playing anymore, but also it's very hard to go bankrupt.

523
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:56,120
Speaker 1: Your companies can just liquidate, and maybe you can't win, but you can keep doing stuff.

524
00:33:56,661 --> 00:33:59,040
Speaker 1: It's very hard to get to a point where you can't do anything.

525
00:34:00,181 --> 00:34:02,640
Speaker 0: So, how does this game go?

526
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:16,337
Speaker 0: Now if you haven't listened to our other 18XX reviews, or if you've never played one of these games, I suggest you check out one of those things first, because I don't want to necessarily explain the entirety of 18XX.

527
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,806
Speaker 1: To explain the entirety of 18XX and also explain 1817 would take forever.

528
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:31,679
Speaker 1: So I'll just keep it to the simplest possible explanation, which is that an 18XX game is a train game, there's an outside game and an inside game.

529
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,679
Speaker 1: In the outside game, you are human beings who are wealthy buying stocks in train companies.

530
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:44,739
Speaker 1: In the inside game, the train companies are the players, and they are playing a separate game of maps with tracks and shit, right?

531
00:34:45,301 --> 00:34:48,833
Speaker 1: That inside game spits out money to the shareholders.

532
00:34:48,914 --> 00:34:50,600
Speaker 1: in the other game, right?

533
00:34:50,821 --> 00:34:59,800
Speaker 1: If you are the president of a company, you take its turn in the inside game, but the winner of the whole game is the winner of the outside game, right?

534
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:04,299
Speaker 1: So you're investing in another game to win the real game.

535
00:35:05,461 --> 00:35:18,780
Speaker 1: So in 1817, the reason it's so great is because in a lot of the other games, the outside game of the buying and selling shares is a very simple and restrictive game where turn order matters a lot.

536
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:23,100
Speaker 0: Turn order matters a lot, and the decisions are usually extremely obvious.

537
00:35:23,344 --> 00:35:24,340
Speaker 0: That is the best company.

538
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,249
Speaker 1: And they're extremely limited.

539
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:29,991
Speaker 1: It's like, okay, you can buy a share, buy a share in the best company.

540
00:35:30,092 --> 00:35:31,100
Speaker 1: Okay, next person.

541
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,460
Speaker 1: I sell all these shitty shares, and I buy a share in the best company.

542
00:35:34,921 --> 00:35:35,504
Speaker 1: Next person.

543
00:35:35,826 --> 00:35:36,871
Speaker 1: I start a new company.

544
00:35:36,991 --> 00:35:38,720
Speaker 1: Okay, there's only eight companies to choose from.

545
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,846
Speaker 1: I choose the best one.

546
00:35:39,866 --> 00:35:42,360
Speaker 1: You know, it's like so few choices.

547
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:46,435
Speaker 1: In 1817, you can start any company anywhere.

548
00:35:46,656 --> 00:35:47,580
Speaker 1: Then there's an auction.

549
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,972
Speaker 1: Then you can start short selling it.

550
00:35:49,992 --> 00:35:53,254
Speaker 1: The companies are two share companies, five share companies, 10 share companies.

551
00:35:53,274 --> 00:35:53,940
Speaker 1: You can merge them.

552
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,804
Speaker 1: You can convert them.

553
00:35:55,106 --> 00:35:57,540
Speaker 1: You can have one company buy another company.

554
00:35:57,941 --> 00:36:00,000
Speaker 1: You can take loans and go out of business.

555
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:03,260
Speaker 0: You can do whatever the hell you feel like.

556
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:11,930
Speaker 0: One of our friends short-sold one of my companies, and then a little while later realized that was a bad idea because that company was just growing and growing and growing, and other people bought all the market shares.

557
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,900
Speaker 0: He could not cover his short.

558
00:36:14,241 --> 00:36:15,739
Speaker 0: He was paying dividends all the way to the end.

559
00:36:16,721 --> 00:36:16,923
Speaker 1: Yep.

560
00:36:17,628 --> 00:36:19,340
Speaker 1: All kinds of ridiculous things can happen.

561
00:36:20,885 --> 00:36:22,714
Speaker 1: So, all the action is in the stock round.

562
00:36:22,855 --> 00:36:27,960
Speaker 1: So, at the start of the game, you know, you got your private auction, the normal private auction, right?

563
00:36:28,763 --> 00:36:34,786
Speaker 1: It works pretty similarly to the other ones except there's this government money, this seed money.

564
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:36,580
Speaker 1: The government wants trains to happen.

565
00:36:38,121 --> 00:36:40,319
Speaker 1: So, there's $200 in cash the government's given out.

566
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,792
Speaker 1: So, you bid on these private companies.

567
00:36:42,832 --> 00:36:44,040
Speaker 1: They have these set values.

568
00:36:44,641 --> 00:36:51,769
Speaker 1: If the winner of the auction ends up bidding, their highest bid is less than the face value of the private company.

569
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:53,120
Speaker 1: Let's say it's an $80 company.

570
00:36:53,603 --> 00:36:55,694
Speaker 1: The high bidder is paying $60.

571
00:36:55,694 --> 00:36:56,840
Speaker 1: They bid $60 and that's it.

572
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,947
Speaker 1: No one's bidding higher than that.

573
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,480
Speaker 1: The government pays the extra $20.

574
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,120
Speaker 1: So, the person who bought it and won the auction is getting $20.

575
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:04,346
Speaker 0: Yep.

576
00:37:04,407 --> 00:37:04,960
Speaker 0: You get subsidized.

577
00:37:06,162 --> 00:37:06,967
Speaker 1: Yeah.

578
00:37:07,148 --> 00:37:09,060
Speaker 1: And then, what do you do with the private companies?

579
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:19,659
Speaker 1: Well, in the other 18XX games, you would usually start a public company and then sell the private company to the public company sometimes at cost, sometimes at a profit, you know, something like that.

580
00:37:20,463 --> 00:37:21,446
Speaker 1: That's not how this works.

581
00:37:21,567 --> 00:37:27,810
Speaker 1: Instead, in this one, you use the private companies to help you start public companies.

582
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:31,501
Speaker 1: So, I want to start a public company for $200.

583
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:32,182
Speaker 1: I've got an $80 private.

584
00:37:32,202 --> 00:37:45,140
Speaker 1: So, when I start it, I pay the private $80 and $120 in cash and that starts the public company and the private company is now part of the public company.

585
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:45,301
Speaker 1: Yep.

586
00:37:45,441 --> 00:37:46,747
Speaker 0: Now, there's pros and cons of this.

587
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:48,676
Speaker 0: On one hand, so I have a $100 private.

588
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:56,693
Speaker 0: I use it as part of the seed capital to start my public company, but now that public company doesn't get $100.

589
00:37:56,693 --> 00:37:58,660
Speaker 0: It just gets that company in the power.

590
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,879
Speaker 0: The private is in the company, but now my company doesn't have any cash.

591
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:04,226
Speaker 1: And it has to take loans to get cash.

592
00:38:06,253 --> 00:38:06,735
Speaker 1: All right.

593
00:38:06,755 --> 00:38:07,678
Speaker 1: So, that's the first thing.

594
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:08,220
Speaker 1: that's different.

595
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,860
Speaker 1: The next thing, you start companies, these public companies.

596
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:14,620
Speaker 1: You're starting two share companies, which means you own the whole thing and that's it.

597
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,832
Speaker 1: There's no selling or buying shares.

598
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:18,400
Speaker 1: They're just a two share company.

599
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,539
Speaker 0: If I pay out, I just get all the money.

600
00:38:21,563 --> 00:38:23,540
Speaker 1: If you withhold, the company keeps all the money.

601
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:31,689
Speaker 1: And in other 18XX games, it's often a very easy choice whether you withhold or pay out and sometimes half pay.

602
00:38:31,971 --> 00:38:33,160
Speaker 1: It's a really easy choice.

603
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:33,681
Speaker 0: Yep.

604
00:38:33,701 --> 00:38:35,160
Speaker 0: A lot of them don't even let you half pay.

605
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,242
Speaker 1: Yeah.

606
00:38:36,282 --> 00:38:38,180
Speaker 1: Some of them would even let you half pay and it's always obvious.

607
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:44,719
Speaker 1: It's like always pay out unless you have to withhold and only withhold if you have to or if you're going to buy a trade right now.

608
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,020
Speaker 0: I think I used all three options repeatedly in varying situations throughout the entire first game.

609
00:38:51,601 --> 00:38:58,460
Speaker 1: In 1817, the buy, the payout, withhold and half pay options is a meaningful decision every single turn.

610
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:03,100
Speaker 1: And none of the options are rarely obviously wrong.

611
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,960
Speaker 1: It's like there's merits to all three every single time.

612
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:10,460
Speaker 1: And it's an interesting decision that has huge consequences.

613
00:39:10,902 --> 00:39:19,360
Speaker 1: You can withhold and pay off your company's loans and make your company really strong so its stock price will not get out of control.

614
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:23,180
Speaker 1: You don't want the stock price to be too high because you can be short sold.

615
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,799
Speaker 1: Unless it's a two share company.

616
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:30,900
Speaker 1: But in 18XX companies and other 18XX games, you just want the share price to go up.

617
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,720
Speaker 1: You don't really want it to go down ever.

618
00:39:34,021 --> 00:39:38,019
Speaker 1: In 1817, you don't want it to get too high because it will be sold short often.

619
00:39:38,361 --> 00:39:41,860
Speaker 0: Now in case you're not familiar with this concept, this is a real world stock thing.

620
00:39:42,944 --> 00:39:45,860
Speaker 0: Normally you think I buy some stock from Scott, the Scott exchange.

621
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,068
Speaker 0: I buy some stock in Scott.

622
00:39:47,391 --> 00:39:48,380
Speaker 0: Later I sell some stock.

623
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:50,620
Speaker 0: I pass these certificates back and forth.

624
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,939
Speaker 0: But imagine I don't have any Scott stock.

625
00:39:53,662 --> 00:39:55,654
Speaker 0: And I sell Scott stock anyway.

626
00:39:55,694 --> 00:39:56,679
Speaker 0: I basically sell an IOU.

627
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,220
Speaker 1: You sell something you don't have.

628
00:39:58,381 --> 00:39:59,999
Speaker 0: I sell an IOU to someone else.

629
00:40:00,861 --> 00:40:01,589
Speaker 0: That is real.

630
00:40:01,852 --> 00:40:02,520
Speaker 0: In the real world.

631
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,840
Speaker 0: That happens in the stock market.

632
00:40:04,946 --> 00:40:05,932
Speaker 0: It happens for a reason.

633
00:40:05,993 --> 00:40:07,260
Speaker 0: It's probably good that it exists.

634
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,198
Speaker 0: But let's not get into that.

635
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:16,140
Speaker 0: But the problem is I now owe that person a real share of the stock at some point in the future.

636
00:40:16,601 --> 00:40:20,159
Speaker 0: Which means either I have to give them a real share at some point.

637
00:40:20,941 --> 00:40:25,680
Speaker 0: Or I have to pay them anything that happens to that stock.

638
00:40:27,321 --> 00:40:35,439
Speaker 1: So I sell rim a share of company X. But I don't have a share of company X. I don't own one.

639
00:40:36,441 --> 00:40:39,219
Speaker 1: Rim, now, basically, he doesn't own one either.

640
00:40:39,741 --> 00:40:44,899
Speaker 1: But he's got a contract from me that basically says, "Yeah, you have to pretend that I own

641
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:45,140
Speaker 1: one.".

642
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,008
Speaker 0: So company X pays out a big dividend.

643
00:40:47,169 --> 00:40:49,760
Speaker 0: Scott has to pay me the dividend that I would write for it yet.

644
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:55,558
Speaker 1: It's like Rim saying, "Hey, if I had actually owned a real share of company X right now, I'd be getting a hundred

645
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:55,858
Speaker 1: bucks.".

646
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:57,123
Speaker 1: But I don't.

647
00:40:57,223 --> 00:41:00,717
Speaker 1: I just have an IOU from Scott that says, "I owe you one company X

648
00:41:00,757 --> 00:41:01,038
Speaker 1: share.".

649
00:41:01,661 --> 00:41:03,960
Speaker 1: So Scott's now on the hook to pay Rim a hundred bucks.

650
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,840
Speaker 0: Now, in the real world, there's this concept of borrowing the stock.

651
00:41:09,507 --> 00:41:11,759
Speaker 0: Like someone selling short borrows the stock from someone.

652
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,473
Speaker 0: Or there's a naked short.

653
00:41:13,534 --> 00:41:14,180
Speaker 0: It gets complicated.

654
00:41:14,843 --> 00:41:15,950
Speaker 0: This is a board game.

655
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:17,380
Speaker 0: It's not that complicated.

656
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:26,680
Speaker 0: In the board game, the way this is reflected, if I sell short in someone else's company, I basically just put a short share marker to say that I'm short in the company.

657
00:41:27,343 --> 00:41:31,058
Speaker 0: And I sell it to the market and get the cash as though I'd sold it.

658
00:41:32,503 --> 00:41:32,718
Speaker 0: Free money.

659
00:41:34,102 --> 00:41:42,547
Speaker 1: So this is really interesting because now short selling is A, it is a way to say, "Hey, that company is overvalued.

660
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:44,899
Speaker 1: I'm going to sell it even though I don't own

661
00:41:44,959 --> 00:41:44,999
Speaker 1: it.".

662
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:48,200
Speaker 1: And then it's going to go down and then I'll buy it back and make a profit that way.

663
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:51,254
Speaker 1: That is the basic fundamentals of stocks.

664
00:41:53,142 --> 00:41:54,439
Speaker 1: Buy low, sell high.

665
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:57,440
Speaker 1: Well, if it's already high and you don't own any, sell high.

666
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,877
Speaker 1: And then when it goes down, buy low.

667
00:41:59,744 --> 00:42:00,858
Speaker 1: It's just the opposite, right?

668
00:42:01,341 --> 00:42:15,480
Speaker 1: But in an 18XX game, a game in which you don't start with a lot of money and you spent a lot of it on private companies, and all your companies are two share companies that you can't sell, you need to get cash to do business, right?

669
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:20,500
Speaker 1: And the companies can take loans, but you can't take loans as a person.

670
00:42:21,124 --> 00:42:22,199
Speaker 1: So what the hell do you do?

671
00:42:22,642 --> 00:42:26,100
Speaker 1: You sell short in something to get instant cash.

672
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:32,340
Speaker 1: You sell something you don't have and poof, a pile of dollar bills appears in front of you that you can invest.

673
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:38,578
Speaker 1: And if that investment pays off and the company you shorted sucks, you're making money on both ends.

674
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:46,009
Speaker 1: You sold something high, it goes down, and the money you got when you sold it high is making positive gains in a company.

675
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:46,879
Speaker 1: you started with it.

676
00:42:47,421 --> 00:42:54,480
Speaker 1: And then you'd use those positive gains to buy the cheapo share in the company that was failing that you shorted in, and it's good times.

677
00:42:56,100 --> 00:43:02,348
Speaker 1: So this helps players who in other 18XX games might be stuck saying, "Well, nothing to do this turn.

678
00:43:02,368 --> 00:43:07,200
Speaker 1: I got no cash and I don't want to sell anything," can instead say, "Well, what's overvalued?

679
00:43:07,281 --> 00:43:09,640
Speaker 1: I'm going to short something and suddenly I'm going to do business.

680
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,476
Speaker 1: There's a lot more activity because you can have a lot more

681
00:43:12,537 --> 00:43:13,040
Speaker 1: liquidity.".

682
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:13,362
Speaker 0: Yep.

683
00:43:13,464 --> 00:43:24,199
Speaker 0: There's a little bit of pushy luck though there because in the real world, shorting stock, the common line if you talk to an investment manager or take a basic class in this stuff is-- Risky as hell, don't do it.

684
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:33,080
Speaker 0: Shorting stock has moderate upsides and unlimited downsides, literally unlimited.

685
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:39,613
Speaker 0: In the real world, I short Apple and Apple just keeps going up and up and up and up and up and up and up.

686
00:43:39,633 --> 00:43:40,460
Speaker 0: I am fucked.

687
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if I buy a share of Apple, what's a share of Apple cost?

688
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:45,180
Speaker 1: Probably a fortune.

689
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:45,541
Speaker 0: Yeah.

690
00:43:45,682 --> 00:43:53,260
Speaker 1: Okay, so if I buy one share of Apple, whatever it costs, the worst case scenario, Apple goes out of business.

691
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:55,479
Speaker 1: I lose the money I spent.

692
00:43:56,503 --> 00:43:58,596
Speaker 1: Let's say there's another company that's only $100 a share.

693
00:43:59,360 --> 00:43:59,923
Speaker 1: I buy a share.

694
00:43:59,943 --> 00:44:02,055
Speaker 1: I can lose $100.

695
00:44:02,055 --> 00:44:02,880
Speaker 1: That's all I can lose.

696
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,973
Speaker 1: I put $100 in a slot machine.

697
00:44:05,154 --> 00:44:05,940
Speaker 1: How much can I lose?

698
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,224
Speaker 1: 100.

699
00:44:07,224 --> 00:44:13,460
Speaker 1: Imagine it as a slot machine and you can lose infinity because the price can just never stop going up.

700
00:44:13,781 --> 00:44:23,339
Speaker 0: And in the real world, at some point, you are forced to cover that share, meaning you are forced by law and contract to go buy Apple stock no matter what it costs.

701
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,460
Speaker 1: And give it to the person you sold it short to.

702
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:28,301
Speaker 1: Okay, I sold short when the Apple stock was $100.

703
00:44:28,301 --> 00:44:30,500
Speaker 1: It's now a million dollars a share.

704
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:36,941
Speaker 1: You just lost $9,999,100.

705
00:44:36,941 --> 00:44:39,180
Speaker 0: So the shorting is really interesting.

706
00:44:39,763 --> 00:44:44,040
Speaker 0: That's a way that unlocks the game by letting players have an option to take risks to get capital.

707
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,020
Speaker 0: But the companies can also take loans.

708
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:59,700
Speaker 0: The combination of the loans and the fact that half pay, full pay, with whole dividends are all valid options means that you have a lot of flexibility in how you run your company.

709
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,919
Speaker 0: You can do things like take a bunch of loans.

710
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,980
Speaker 0: Every time you take a loan, your stock price drops.

711
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,749
Speaker 0: But you get capital.

712
00:45:07,275 --> 00:45:07,800
Speaker 0: Use the capital.

713
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,980
Speaker 1: If your company is overvalued, maybe take some loans to bring it down.

714
00:45:11,264 --> 00:45:12,159
Speaker 1: That's a good idea.

715
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:15,360
Speaker 0: Or maybe take some loans to drive your stock price down.

716
00:45:16,161 --> 00:45:21,340
Speaker 0: Then buy back shares in the market into your own company treasury.

717
00:45:21,901 --> 00:45:23,680
Speaker 0: Then next turn, pay the loans back.

718
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,259
Speaker 0: Your stock goes back up.

719
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:30,720
Speaker 0: And then you or other players buy those treasury shares and put even more money into the company.

720
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:31,821
Speaker 1: Yep.

721
00:45:32,264 --> 00:45:34,240
Speaker 1: All kinds of shenanigans are now possible.

722
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:39,299
Speaker 0: We could spend an hour outlining all the shenanigans you can get up to with this simple set of rules.

723
00:45:40,044 --> 00:45:42,760
Speaker 1: In other 18XX games, a company would be capitalized.

724
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,140
Speaker 1: It would get its cash by selling all the treasury shares, and that would probably be the end of it.

725
00:45:47,381 --> 00:45:48,980
Speaker 1: It wouldn't get any more cash ever.

726
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:53,100
Speaker 1: It buys trains with that money, and then it just never buys trains again.

727
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:53,876
Speaker 1: The end.

728
00:45:54,842 --> 00:46:05,340
Speaker 1: Unless some other company comes along with its money to help that first company out, that first company might just end up being ruined and ruin the president because they had to buy a train with their own money.

729
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,675
Speaker 1: Here, loans.

730
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,275
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, I need all my trains rusted.

731
00:46:10,295 --> 00:46:11,040
Speaker 1: I need a new train.

732
00:46:11,443 --> 00:46:12,939
Speaker 1: I'll take some loans and buy a new train.

733
00:46:13,884 --> 00:46:14,551
Speaker 0: Ta-da!

734
00:46:14,591 --> 00:46:15,400
Speaker 0: Saved by the bell.

735
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:21,720
Speaker 0: Every time you take a loan, not only does the stock price of your company just move left in the market, like every loan, stock price goes down.

736
00:46:22,242 --> 00:46:23,697
Speaker 0: Every payoff, stock price goes up.

737
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:32,500
Speaker 0: Loans have interest, and the interest rises depending on how many loans everyone collectively has taken out.

738
00:46:33,802 --> 00:46:39,018
Speaker 0: So every operating round, you've got to pay that interest on the loans you have not paid off.

739
00:46:39,828 --> 00:46:40,079
Speaker 1: Yep.

740
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:41,611
Speaker 1: That can be a problem.

741
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:49,939
Speaker 1: This is why you're going to be half paying and withholding, so the company keeps more cash because the company needs cash to pay off loans and pay off loan interest.

742
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:50,425
Speaker 0: Or emerging.

743
00:46:50,445 --> 00:46:51,720
Speaker 0: Your company's in dire straits.

744
00:46:51,801 --> 00:46:54,480
Speaker 0: You merge it with another two companies that has a lot of cash.

745
00:46:54,781 --> 00:46:57,840
Speaker 0: Now you've got a five-share company that can pay off all its loans.

746
00:46:59,504 --> 00:47:06,380
Speaker 1: And if a company merges or converts, there might be more shares in the treasury that can now be sold to infuse the company with more capital.

747
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:15,480
Speaker 0: Yep, and the company now merges their tokens together, and now you have a larger space, a bigger footprint on the map to operate and make more revenue, theoretically.

748
00:47:17,024 --> 00:47:18,820
Speaker 0: So there's two companies, two-share companies.

749
00:47:19,141 --> 00:47:25,800
Speaker 0: You can convert them to five-share companies, there's a process for that, where you then get the opportunity to buy up treasury shares.

750
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:31,080
Speaker 0: You can also merge two two-share companies together into a five-share company.

751
00:47:31,522 --> 00:47:39,320
Speaker 0: And then five-share companies can themselves be converted up into ten-share companies, or two five-share companies can merge into a ten-share company.

752
00:47:40,182 --> 00:47:40,459
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

753
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,500
Speaker 0: That's a whole aspect of the game by itself.

754
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,856
Speaker 0: There's a big set of power plays around.

755
00:47:44,916 --> 00:47:52,920
Speaker 0: things like make two companies that are near each other that kind of synergize, then merge them, take a bunch of loans, buy a giant train, and now you're cooking.

756
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:53,981
Speaker 1: Yep.

757
00:47:54,423 --> 00:47:57,320
Speaker 1: You can also, there's selling companies.

758
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:01,020
Speaker 1: So if a company's stock price gets too low, they enter the acquisition zone.

759
00:48:01,541 --> 00:48:05,779
Speaker 1: If a company is in the acquisition zone, any other company is forcibly buying it.

760
00:48:06,361 --> 00:48:07,080
Speaker 0: Yup, for nothing.

761
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:09,940
Speaker 1: Well, potentially nothing.

762
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:10,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, for very little.

763
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:15,100
Speaker 1: If a company enters the liquidation zone, it just goes away.

764
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:25,037
Speaker 1: So you don't get ruined by being in a situation where your company needs a train and doesn't have one, because the company will just go away.

765
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:27,260
Speaker 0: That's the biggest difference of all train games.

766
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:32,960
Speaker 0: This is a train game where, an ATX game, you are totally allowed to just not fucking buy a train.

767
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:37,260
Speaker 1: But you will have to pay off any loans that are still in there.

768
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:42,620
Speaker 0: Yup, the president of the company is on the hook for the loans of any company that gets liquidated.

769
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:43,628
Speaker 1: Yup.

770
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:49,180
Speaker 1: The acquisition part can be the forced acquisition if the stock price gets too low.

771
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,640
Speaker 1: There's also friendly acquisition.

772
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:51,966
Speaker 1: You can just say, "Hey, you know what?

773
00:48:51,986 --> 00:48:55,409
Speaker 1: This company that's not doing poorly at all, it's for sale.

774
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:56,156
Speaker 1: Who wants to buy

775
00:48:56,176 --> 00:48:56,217
Speaker 1: it?".

776
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,500
Speaker 1: And just sell it and see what it's worth on the market.

777
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:04,140
Speaker 1: If it ends up being worth more than its current stock value, you just made bank.

778
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:07,639
Speaker 0: You basically got to buy all the shares in the company, but the game just handles it.

779
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,859
Speaker 0: There's a whole process for it.

780
00:49:09,602 --> 00:49:18,540
Speaker 0: But yeah, the company might not be doing well for Scott, but I have a company that would really, really be able to leverage all those tokens Scott's got.

781
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:23,380
Speaker 0: I might pay a premium to Scott so Scott can cash out on that company.

782
00:49:23,641 --> 00:49:25,631
Speaker 0: He's doing better, and I get all those tokens.

783
00:49:25,691 --> 00:49:26,556
Speaker 0: Now I'm doing better.

784
00:49:26,616 --> 00:49:27,299
Speaker 0: Screw everybody else.

785
00:49:28,242 --> 00:49:28,443
Speaker 1: Yup.

786
00:49:29,289 --> 00:49:30,840
Speaker 1: So many interesting, ridiculous things.

787
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,800
Speaker 0: We haven't even scratched the surface of how all the systems work either.

788
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:34,641
Speaker 1: Right, no.

789
00:49:34,742 --> 00:49:41,680
Speaker 1: The one big thing that I think is the best is that so few things, the turn order matters.

790
00:49:42,181 --> 00:49:44,540
Speaker 1: And when the turn order does matter, you can manipulate it more.

791
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:50,078
Speaker 1: So the biggest way the turn order doesn't matter is that so many things are now auctioned.

792
00:49:52,001 --> 00:49:53,620
Speaker 1: Versus before, where it's first come first serve.

793
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,586
Speaker 0: Yup, even an IPO.

794
00:49:54,889 --> 00:49:56,400
Speaker 0: I do an IPO, brand new company.

795
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:59,940
Speaker 0: I say the price I want to open it at, like what's the share price.

796
00:50:00,402 --> 00:50:01,979
Speaker 0: I say where the token's going to start.

797
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:06,660
Speaker 0: And then we go around bidding on what that IPO is actually going to be.

798
00:50:07,021 --> 00:50:09,238
Speaker 0: If Scott starts in the spot I wanted, I can outbid him.

799
00:50:12,581 --> 00:50:19,267
Speaker 1: There's also bidding for the privates, and there's bidding for... Oh, if something is going to be sold.

800
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:22,240
Speaker 1: If someone wants to sell a company, there's bidding to sell the company.

801
00:50:23,422 --> 00:50:23,843
Speaker 0: Yup.

802
00:50:24,324 --> 00:50:26,329
Speaker 0: And one other fiddly aspect.

803
00:50:26,349 --> 00:50:31,420
Speaker 0: that's really nice, you can take loans at any time with your companies.

804
00:50:31,521 --> 00:50:34,039
Speaker 0: Both during stock rounds and operating rounds.

805
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:34,972
Speaker 1: Yup.

806
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:42,880
Speaker 0: So during the stock round you might take a loan randomly, like in the middle of a stock round, to lower the value of your company.

807
00:50:43,321 --> 00:50:50,359
Speaker 0: So it goes after some other company that is going to buy the last shitty 4 train so you can get the 5 train.

808
00:50:52,181 --> 00:50:56,557
Speaker 1: Or you might be sitting in the stock round and saying, "Man, my company is going to get sold short.

809
00:50:56,638 --> 00:50:57,240
Speaker 1: That's not good.

810
00:50:58,501 --> 00:51:00,654
Speaker 1: It's valued at $300 a share right now.

811
00:51:00,754 --> 00:51:02,240
Speaker 1: It's maybe worth $200.

812
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,365
Speaker 1: RIM's going to sell it short.

813
00:51:03,687 --> 00:51:04,711
Speaker 1: That's not a good deal.

814
00:51:04,852 --> 00:51:05,816
Speaker 1: Let me take 10

815
00:51:05,816 --> 00:51:06,017
Speaker 1: loans.".

816
00:51:06,704 --> 00:51:06,767
Speaker 1: Yup.

817
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:09,506
Speaker 1: So now the stock price went down to crap now.

818
00:51:10,608 --> 00:51:11,791
Speaker 1: RIM can't really sell it.

819
00:51:11,931 --> 00:51:12,833
Speaker 1: RIM sells it short.

820
00:51:12,873 --> 00:51:15,580
Speaker 1: He's going to get $100 less per sold short share.

821
00:51:17,183 --> 00:51:18,980
Speaker 1: And that's going to be good times, right?

822
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:19,801
Speaker 0: Yup.

823
00:51:19,821 --> 00:51:24,620
Speaker 0: But you can only pay off loans during one specific phase in the operating rounds.

824
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:27,736
Speaker 1: See it.

825
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:34,400
Speaker 0: There's a lot else we could talk about, but I think another thing that's interesting is the train situation is very different.

826
00:51:34,721 --> 00:51:38,256
Speaker 0: In the first OR operating round, there's an unlimited number of $100 2 trains.

827
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,235
Speaker 0: So you don't have to play that game of, "Buy all the 2 trains.

828
00:51:42,255 --> 00:51:42,717
Speaker 1: They rust

829
00:51:42,778 --> 00:51:43,220
Speaker 1: immediately."

830
00:51:43,923 --> 00:51:45,247
Speaker 1: And you can buy them with loans.

831
00:51:45,488 --> 00:51:48,800
Speaker 1: So you can start a bunch of companies and get a bunch of 2 trains.

832
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:56,720
Speaker 0: But the operating order in the first rounds only matter for tiles because everyone can buy as many 2 trains as they want.

833
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:02,958
Speaker 0: So the choice is not, "How many 2 trains do I buy based on what everyone else is buying to get the game to a certain

834
00:52:03,018 --> 00:52:03,339
Speaker 0: phase?"

835
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,144
Speaker 0: Like, "Push it to green at the right

836
00:52:05,184 --> 00:52:05,464
Speaker 0: time.".

837
00:52:05,925 --> 00:52:10,837
Speaker 0: The decision is now, "How many 2 trains do I want for this

838
00:52:10,917 --> 00:52:11,278
Speaker 0: company?".

839
00:52:13,124 --> 00:52:13,892
Speaker 0: And then there's some 2+ trains.

840
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,540
Speaker 1: How many are going to make up the $100 loan I had to take to get that?

841
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:19,161
Speaker 0: Yup.

842
00:52:19,181 --> 00:52:20,447
Speaker 0: There are 2, 2+, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 trains.

843
00:52:24,242 --> 00:52:29,680
Speaker 0: The game is a long, slow cycle of trains that give you a lot of time to mess around.

844
00:52:31,501 --> 00:52:37,037
Speaker 0: And the game basically ends when someone buys the first 8 train, or the first 8 train gets exported.

845
00:52:37,137 --> 00:52:38,160
Speaker 0: Then it's the end of the game.

846
00:52:38,941 --> 00:52:39,121
Speaker 1: Yup.

847
00:52:39,864 --> 00:52:44,700
Speaker 1: So yeah, if you are someone who likes a stock market kind of game, right?

848
00:52:45,823 --> 00:52:48,820
Speaker 1: Because the stock markets in other 18XX games are too simple.

849
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:54,980
Speaker 1: And the train action is still there, but it's not as big as the train action in some of the other ones.

850
00:52:55,601 --> 00:52:57,679
Speaker 1: Then this is the 18XX for you.

851
00:52:58,423 --> 00:53:02,540
Speaker 1: If you don't want any trains, but you want stock market action, you should go play Black Friday.

852
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:07,280
Speaker 1: The different game by Freedman Freeze.

853
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,310
Speaker 0: I would like to play that game.

854
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:09,180
Speaker 0: I really like that game.

855
00:53:09,621 --> 00:53:10,938
Speaker 1: I do like that game a lot, yeah.

856
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:16,460
Speaker 1: But yeah, of the 18XX I've played, this one has the best stock market.

857
00:53:17,241 --> 00:53:19,819
Speaker 1: There is still turn order, but it doesn't matter as much.

858
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:25,080
Speaker 1: And it almost provides too much freedom, right?

859
00:53:25,342 --> 00:53:27,900
Speaker 1: Just because you should, you could, and doesn't mean you should.

860
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:29,944
Speaker 0: But that's a difference in feel.

861
00:53:30,004 --> 00:53:34,840
Speaker 0: In a lot of other 18XX games, if you can, you often should with weird stuff.

862
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:36,699
Speaker 1: Yup, exactly.

863
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:41,640
Speaker 1: Whereas here, there's so many things you can do, but should you, probably not.

864
00:53:43,221 --> 00:53:52,120
Speaker 0: So I think it's my favorite 18XX game, because the only thing I don't like about them is how little agency I have over the player order.

865
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:57,680
Speaker 0: Which itself tends to control a lot of the opportunities you might have.

866
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:03,940
Speaker 0: In this game, you have a lot of agency over the player order, well more so than you do in other 18XX games.

867
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:09,840
Speaker 0: But also, you aren't as tied to that in terms of your opportunities.

868
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:18,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, well I mean also the player turn order, it doesn't just matter as much, because in the other 18XX, there'll be like seven companies, that's it, right?

869
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:27,800
Speaker 1: So you wanna go first, so you can sell, dump on someone, or buy a company, be able to buy the good companies, you don't get C&O or whatever, right?

870
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:29,780
Speaker 0: Companies need to start anywhere.

871
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,600
