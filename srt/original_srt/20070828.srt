1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,496
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday August 28th.

2
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:12,559
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,628
Speaker 1: I'm rim, and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,688 --> 00:00:21,356
Speaker 1: We review Mario's strikers charge our.

5
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:25,413
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:32,026
Speaker 0: ah Digi games, I've been really feeling it lately.

7
00:00:32,046 --> 00:00:42,207
Speaker 1: I got to say Yeah, the thing is I got it sort of contained myself and forced myself to beat paper Mario before I play all these other judges that I have to force myself to go to goddamn bed.

8
00:00:42,227 --> 00:00:53,484
Speaker 0: now I mean Sunday night we started playing on natural selection and then midnight rolls around and I my brain says Rim you got to go to work in the morning, and I said shut up you.

9
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,077
Speaker 1: yes I know what's wrong on this server.

10
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:56,942
Speaker 1: They're not going to bed.

11
00:00:56,962 --> 00:00:58,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know you know what's funny.

12
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,283
Speaker 0: It's back in college rims on the server.

13
00:01:00,323 --> 00:01:01,069
Speaker 1: He's not going to bed.

14
00:01:01,372 --> 00:01:07,247
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I was like I see Scott there I see waters poison there Alex is there and I guess I can stay up to.

15
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:08,393
Speaker 1: yeah Why not?

16
00:01:08,453 --> 00:01:09,719
Speaker 1: other people are different ones doing it.

17
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,649
Speaker 0: man now the funny thing was back in RIT.

18
00:01:11,852 --> 00:01:13,050
Speaker 0: That was kind of a valid excuse.

19
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:18,950
Speaker 0: I mean I when I started playing NS or counter-strike or tribes or anything at night didn't matter what day of the week it was.

20
00:01:19,756 --> 00:01:21,470
Speaker 0: It wasn't like oh, I have class in the morning.

21
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:28,290
Speaker 0: It was I played until the game wound down and everyone went to bed and sometimes that just didn't happen, and I just kept playing.

22
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:32,537
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's how The multiplayer games go.

23
00:01:32,618 --> 00:01:45,610
Speaker 0: it really took a lot of effort to say to myself all right I am going to stop playing now that the round is ended and not play the next round Despite the fact that I'm the only one leaving the server right now, and I felt like a loser.

24
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:50,842
Speaker 0: I actually played one more round Because Scott comes in immediately was like man.

25
00:01:50,862 --> 00:01:52,229
Speaker 0: the round you miss was like the best one.

26
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:54,208
Speaker 1: It was a pretty good around that last round.

27
00:01:54,228 --> 00:01:56,441
Speaker 0: there I was because the teams were starting to.

28
00:01:57,005 --> 00:02:08,148
Speaker 0: it was kind of bad because Like one team would get creamed every round and then as time went on it started kind of even and out as the good players And the bad players started to get to know each other and the team started working properly.

29
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:08,729
Speaker 0: like one round.

30
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:15,981
Speaker 0: We were aliens and some guy built sense first Which is okay if everyone on the team is down with that.

31
00:02:16,142 --> 00:02:17,646
Speaker 1: I was on the Marines that time.

32
00:02:17,907 --> 00:02:19,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was awesome.

33
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,300
Speaker 1: That was the one time that I would.

34
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,429
Speaker 0: yeah thing is I was like awesome.

35
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:26,800
Speaker 0: now I can ambush and focus and thing is how well I did.

36
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,204
Speaker 1: totally depended on the team.

37
00:02:28,264 --> 00:02:30,230
Speaker 1: like that last round when you weren't there.

38
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:33,741
Speaker 1: I was doing real well, but the team lost anyway.

39
00:02:34,042 --> 00:02:35,446
Speaker 1: Yeah, we held out for a while.

40
00:02:35,506 --> 00:02:36,670
Speaker 1: That was a little back and forth.

41
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:43,364
Speaker 0: We just couldn't get the heavy train rolling And I've been playing my DS on the train instead of reading my Cisco books.

42
00:02:44,227 --> 00:02:47,303
Speaker 1: I Don't know why I ran out of stuff to do on the train today.

43
00:02:47,323 --> 00:02:48,590
Speaker 1: I gotta lay more stuff and bring it.

44
00:02:48,771 --> 00:02:50,015
Speaker 0: I can't imagine that happened.

45
00:02:50,035 --> 00:02:52,343
Speaker 1: I mean think it didn't run out of stuff.

46
00:02:52,484 --> 00:02:54,170
Speaker 1: I ran out of stuff on me.

47
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:55,419
Speaker 1: Oh bring more.

48
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,650
Speaker 0: That's the worst thing in the world.

49
00:02:57,052 --> 00:03:02,238
Speaker 0: Yeah, see I don't know why I bought a little portable DVD player for the train because I got a lot of DVDs I want to watch.

50
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,230
Speaker 1: I'd use a laptop.

51
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:03,933
Speaker 1: Why waste that?

52
00:03:03,953 --> 00:03:07,510
Speaker 0: because I well one because that thing's really cheap and a really tiny and really portable.

53
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:10,544
Speaker 0: My laptop is tiny and it's a lot smaller than your laptop.

54
00:03:10,564 --> 00:03:11,368
Speaker 1: It can't be that small.

55
00:03:11,528 --> 00:03:11,890
Speaker 0: It's time.

56
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:13,369
Speaker 0: It's just a battery plus.

57
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:19,770
Speaker 1: If you compare size and screen and screen quality my my laptop has a better ratio.

58
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:20,532
Speaker 0: I don't care.

59
00:03:20,994 --> 00:03:24,645
Speaker 0: besides a lot even a cheap laptop that's worth a damn is like 700 bucks.

60
00:03:24,706 --> 00:03:26,954
Speaker 0: This thing was like a Hundred and something.

61
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:27,717
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

62
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:31,050
Speaker 0: I mean it was super cheap and I'm kind of holding out on a laptop for a while.

63
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:35,268
Speaker 0: Anyway, I don't know what you're holding out for because I don't have any particular need for one.

64
00:03:35,308 --> 00:03:36,994
Speaker 0: all the work I do is online stuff.

65
00:03:37,335 --> 00:03:38,941
Speaker 0: If a computer is not connected to the internet.

66
00:03:39,362 --> 00:03:41,750
Speaker 0: There's almost nothing I can use it for right now.

67
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:49,704
Speaker 0: Google Gears Yeah, it doesn't let me do my Google Docs offline and my email offline yet I think it might and if not, you can do something about it.

68
00:03:49,805 --> 00:03:53,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm holding out Whatever, but I got this thing like alright.

69
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,726
Speaker 0: now I can watch that documentary.

70
00:03:54,746 --> 00:03:55,570
Speaker 0: I bought about Rome.

71
00:03:56,132 --> 00:03:58,361
Speaker 0: Wait a minute, but I'm still playing Pokemon.

72
00:03:58,422 --> 00:04:02,316
Speaker 0: I'm still playing Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Oh, and I'm still reading all those books.

73
00:04:02,657 --> 00:04:02,918
Speaker 0: Fuck.

74
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I think I should start going to work earlier and taking the longer train.

75
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:20,305
Speaker 1: Yeah I pre-ordered the Metroid Prime on the Amazon and I'm actually kind of glad that it's supposedly not gonna ship until like September 10th or something because I'm still playing paper Mario and stuff and I'm not gonna have time to play Metroid.

76
00:04:20,325 --> 00:04:21,450
Speaker 1: so better it not be here.

77
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,629
Speaker 0: Plus I got to say I was reading around the press and what people are saying about that game.

78
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:32,949
Speaker 0: and It's rare that I care what reviewers say and it's rare that I care what people buzzing about a game say because I'll just kind Of wait until it all foments.

79
00:04:33,831 --> 00:04:38,869
Speaker 0: I've yet to hear a human being utter anything bad about the game other than possibly that it might be a little easy.

80
00:04:39,732 --> 00:04:42,258
Speaker 1: You should just play the freakin Metroid Prime meaning.

81
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,750
Speaker 0: I don't like controlling any sort of 3d first-person game.

82
00:04:47,511 --> 00:04:49,919
Speaker 1: Metroid Prime isn't like an FBI.

83
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:50,983
Speaker 0: I didn't say FPS.

84
00:04:51,043 --> 00:04:52,850
Speaker 0: I said first-person anything an FBA.

85
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:54,456
Speaker 1: It's not it's it's.

86
00:04:54,576 --> 00:04:55,300
Speaker 1: you never played it.

87
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,044
Speaker 1: you have no idea.

88
00:04:56,104 --> 00:04:57,230
Speaker 0: it's got started playing it.

89
00:04:57,311 --> 00:04:58,280
Speaker 0: I just didn't really like it.

90
00:04:58,583 --> 00:04:59,310
Speaker 1: You said you're not gonna.

91
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,159
Speaker 1: I don't know why you think you're gonna like this other one cuz.

92
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,170
Speaker 0: I just don't like using those sticks.

93
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:04,614
Speaker 0: I hate analog sticks.

94
00:05:04,855 --> 00:05:05,858
Speaker 0: I want what you barely.

95
00:05:05,878 --> 00:05:08,808
Speaker 1: you only have to use the stick to walk in Metroid Prime, and that's it.

96
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:13,524
Speaker 1: Yeah Using a stick to walk you do that in any 3d game now.

97
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:14,770
Speaker 0: I gotta look around a little bit.

98
00:05:15,051 --> 00:05:15,676
Speaker 0: I don't like that.

99
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:17,750
Speaker 1: You know you look around holding down the button.

100
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,850
Speaker 0: You don't look around with the other stick, but I still got to look around with the stick.

101
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:23,481
Speaker 1: You don't walk while looking around.

102
00:05:23,581 --> 00:05:24,927
Speaker 0: I didn't say walk and look around.

103
00:05:24,967 --> 00:05:26,254
Speaker 0: I said look around I don't like that.

104
00:05:26,536 --> 00:05:28,167
Speaker 1: you you got a problem in your head.

105
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:29,434
Speaker 0: there I'm just.

106
00:05:29,474 --> 00:05:34,441
Speaker 0: I like super super control of my five a game But it's a game where they're super.

107
00:05:34,482 --> 00:05:39,270
Speaker 0: super control is not necessary I know and I'm just saying it bothers me in any any time.

108
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:45,370
Speaker 0: I think you're always a viewpoint every time I control a portal through which I view a world in the first person.

109
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:47,398
Speaker 1: If I don't have so you have.

110
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:51,392
Speaker 1: you have a psychological problem that prevents you from See.

111
00:05:51,492 --> 00:05:56,570
Speaker 1: you have a. you have a mental disorder that prevents you from being able to enjoy one of the greatest games.

112
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,092
Speaker 0: You know what.

113
00:05:57,252 --> 00:05:58,678
Speaker 0: even then I wasn't - I don't.

114
00:05:58,838 --> 00:05:59,701
Speaker 0: the only Metroid game.

115
00:05:59,762 --> 00:06:01,127
Speaker 0: I really liked was Super Metroid.

116
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:01,970
Speaker 0: I'll be honest.

117
00:06:02,251 --> 00:06:03,375
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're stupid.

118
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:07,534
Speaker 0: I played Metroid 1 and I beat it But I didn't.

119
00:06:08,197 --> 00:06:10,449
Speaker 0: I beat it because it was a Nintendo game, and you have to beat it.

120
00:06:11,234 --> 00:06:15,375
Speaker 1: I think you just because you refused to play them in Refuse to play him what.

121
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:16,921
Speaker 0: I played Metroid a lot.

122
00:06:16,962 --> 00:06:20,355
Speaker 1: I didn't say in Metroid the Metroid Prime I did play I play.

123
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:24,010
Speaker 1: I did for a while how waiting for a while like I never seen you play it ever.

124
00:06:24,554 --> 00:06:26,610
Speaker 0: I played it for like four total hours.

125
00:06:26,732 --> 00:06:28,132
Speaker 0: I just didn't get into it And then I stopped.

126
00:06:28,172 --> 00:06:32,088
Speaker 0: and then I had better things to do like tribes and counter-strike and everything else in my life.

127
00:06:32,188 --> 00:06:34,539
Speaker 1: tribes Wasn't working in those days.

128
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:36,730
Speaker 1: by the time Metroid Prime 1 came out traps was dead.

129
00:06:37,073 --> 00:06:38,909
Speaker 0: I tried playing the game way after it came out.

130
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:42,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, try means like turn it on once and then turn it off.

131
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,770
Speaker 0: I think four hours is enough to know if I like a game or not.

132
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:48,046
Speaker 1: I don't believe you played the game for four hours all right, whatever.

133
00:06:48,127 --> 00:06:48,770
Speaker 1: What do you care?

134
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,470
Speaker 1: I'm just saying that you got a problem, okay?

135
00:06:52,410 --> 00:07:03,930
Speaker 1: Anyway, and I know what you think that somehow you seem to think like there are all these games to the Gamecube And they basically make the same game for the Wii and they change the controls slightly and somehow You think the game's gonna?

136
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,210
Speaker 1: You're gonna like the game any more than you liked it on the when it came to Twilight Princess.

137
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:08,455
Speaker 0: It was a hundred percent true.

138
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:09,740
Speaker 0: I love Twilight Princess.

139
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:11,326
Speaker 0: You didn't you barely even played it.

140
00:07:11,346 --> 00:07:12,109
Speaker 0: I don't have time.

141
00:07:14,212 --> 00:07:15,317
Speaker 1: I think you just lying is?

142
00:07:15,378 --> 00:07:16,161
Speaker 0: I want to play it?

143
00:07:16,724 --> 00:07:21,821
Speaker 1: you either don't like You know either don't like Twilight Princess, or you do like hot green of time.

144
00:07:21,882 --> 00:07:22,503
Speaker 1: you didn't know.

145
00:07:22,724 --> 00:07:24,610
Speaker 0: just Twilight Princess is more polished.

146
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:27,238
Speaker 1: So it's the same goddamn game.

147
00:07:27,298 --> 00:07:28,081
Speaker 0: It's more polished.

148
00:07:28,101 --> 00:07:28,924
Speaker 0: It went over the line.

149
00:07:28,944 --> 00:07:30,749
Speaker 1: I don't know what your problem is.

150
00:07:31,571 --> 00:07:34,081
Speaker 1: Anyway, maybe you should do some newses and things like that.

151
00:07:34,182 --> 00:07:35,688
Speaker 0: I was waiting for you all right.

152
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,903
Speaker 1: So that Bioshock game everyone's talking about.

153
00:07:40,004 --> 00:07:41,409
Speaker 0: yeah, I got to play the demo still.

154
00:07:41,549 --> 00:07:42,556
Speaker 0: yeah I haven't had time.

155
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:44,570
Speaker 1: I got that new video card yesterday.

156
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:48,710
Speaker 1: So I played the demo and I can see what everyone's talking about with this game.

157
00:07:48,831 --> 00:07:55,650
Speaker 1: It's it's real heavy like it weighs Heavily on you when you play it and the demos real shorts.

158
00:07:55,771 --> 00:08:08,210
Speaker 1: and I think I actually kind of liked that the demo was short because as Amazing as the experience was and as the work of art the game obviously was It's sort of like was so heavy.

159
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:19,643
Speaker 1: It was like eating a really filling cheesecake where it tasted so good, but then my stomach was on not feeling so well I guess along by those tokens then doom 2 is just like a sprite something like that.

160
00:08:19,664 --> 00:08:30,181
Speaker 1: just Yeah, so I was sort of glad that the demo was short because as amazing as it was it was sort of I Sort of didn't want to.

161
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:36,635
Speaker 1: I got this feeling I didn't want to keep playing because my you know like the same reason you don't want to eat any more cheesecake because your stomach Is full because it's so rich.

162
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:45,287
Speaker 1: So I think it's definitely Just from playing the short demo I can tell it's one of the best games ever top 50 top 100 something like that.

163
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,039
Speaker 1: But it's not like this amazing game of all time.

164
00:08:49,099 --> 00:08:55,900
Speaker 1: Everyone's talking about it like it is but I definitely think that right now It's totally worth playing if you have money this weekend.

165
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,190
Speaker 0: I'm probably gonna play the demo and I might just buy it.

166
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,342
Speaker 1: Yeah, it only takes like a few minutes to get the demo.

167
00:09:01,604 --> 00:09:10,424
Speaker 1: Yeah, the The one thing I'm gonna say the news is is that valve, you know the people who are making Team fortress 2 and half-life and all you know the business.

168
00:09:10,565 --> 00:09:13,159
Speaker 0: Oh touch Sasha There.

169
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,715
Speaker 1: they have banned Bioshock in their office.

170
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:20,652
Speaker 1: not that not like you can't bring the game here or we don't like this game Keep it out.

171
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:25,049
Speaker 1: But like ok guys if we're playing this game, we're never gonna finish our games.

172
00:09:25,572 --> 00:09:26,978
Speaker 1: So they're not gonna.

173
00:09:27,118 --> 00:09:33,429
Speaker 1: no one there is gonna play Bioshock until They're done with Team Fortress 2 and all those games, you know.

174
00:09:34,112 --> 00:09:42,866
Speaker 0: Judging from what people have said about the game and what I know about those people I would wager that because of that Team Fortress 2 is gonna be released in about 10 minutes.

175
00:09:43,127 --> 00:09:50,749
Speaker 1: It's nothing like that Because as soon as they're done with the Team Fortress 2 I guess they're giving everyone in the company a copy of.

176
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,313
Speaker 1: I Imagine

177
00:09:52,353 --> 00:10:07,008
Speaker 0: this imagine back when tribes 2 was that its prime and if suddenly RIT came down and said we are blocking access to the tribes 2 servers until rim and Scott take this terrible test and pass it

178
00:10:09,274 --> 00:10:10,528
Speaker 1: That terrible test to be done

179
00:10:11,272 --> 00:10:11,934
Speaker 0: So fast

180
00:10:12,135 --> 00:10:12,656
Speaker 1: either that or

181
00:10:13,138 --> 00:10:16,027
Speaker 0: everyone in the school who has control over the routers would be dead

182
00:10:16,047 --> 00:10:16,930
Speaker 1: cares about Team Fortress.

183
00:10:18,314 --> 00:10:18,655
Speaker 0: You know what?

184
00:10:18,675 --> 00:10:19,779
Speaker 0: We just have a cable modem.

185
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway, but yeah think about a game.

186
00:10:23,613 --> 00:10:29,064
Speaker 1: It's sort of like that thing they have in Japan where you know It's like a Dragon Quest game comes out in a school day.

187
00:10:29,105 --> 00:10:29,989
Speaker 1: No one goes to school.

188
00:10:30,473 --> 00:10:31,643
Speaker 1: It's you know, like what are those?

189
00:10:31,683 --> 00:10:32,409
Speaker 0: I gotta say though?

190
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:36,567
Speaker 1: I heard that that's just an urban legend that but I'm not a hundred percent sure.

191
00:10:36,627 --> 00:10:37,290
Speaker 1: it's totally fine.

192
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,803
Speaker 0: I can say that when Team Fortress 2 comes out.

193
00:10:40,427 --> 00:10:43,629
Speaker 0: I'm Almost certainly going to take the day after off work.

194
00:10:44,152 --> 00:10:45,216
Speaker 1: I probably will as well.

195
00:10:45,236 --> 00:10:48,530
Speaker 1: and you know what unlike Metroid Prime Team Fortress 2 comes out on Steam.

196
00:10:48,892 --> 00:10:51,970
Speaker 1: So there's no chance of Amazon not getting it to me on time.

197
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,774
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's no way.

198
00:10:53,076 --> 00:10:59,469
Speaker 1: a media pre-loaded before the game is out It's on my hard drive and then as soon as the game is released valve unlocks it.

199
00:11:00,011 --> 00:11:02,741
Speaker 1: It's sort of a DRM but not really because they give you they.

200
00:11:02,822 --> 00:11:07,283
Speaker 1: all they're really doing is just giving you most of the game And then they give you the last bit of the game at the last second.

201
00:11:07,344 --> 00:11:08,370
Speaker 0: This is a new thing for me.

202
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:13,189
Speaker 0: I mean, I skipped something at RIT to drive Scott to get his GameCube the day it came out.

203
00:11:13,651 --> 00:11:20,110
Speaker 0: But well skip something kind of because Scott picked it up way before the class, but I just didn't go to the class.

204
00:11:21,271 --> 00:11:26,030
Speaker 0: But I've never taken a day off of work because of a video game and this might be that day.

205
00:11:26,512 --> 00:11:32,155
Speaker 1: I think it might be that day just because this is one game where I think I'm gonna play it a lot and I want To make sure my skills are up.

206
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,946
Speaker 1: I don't have the low skills rim weighted.

207
00:11:34,966 --> 00:11:35,287
Speaker 0: Yeah.

208
00:11:36,836 --> 00:11:38,448
Speaker 0: So speaking of valve, huh?

209
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:47,670
Speaker 0: there's an article on slash out here and I'm just gonna get right to the point of it because I got a few things to Say and then there's a slightly tangential conversation that I'm pretty sure is just gonna happen.

210
00:11:48,412 --> 00:11:50,558
Speaker 0: So I'm just gonna quote the slash dot right here valves.

211
00:11:50,618 --> 00:11:52,945
Speaker 0: president Gabe Newell is calling new.

212
00:11:52,965 --> 00:11:54,168
Speaker 1: well, I'm not sure.

213
00:11:54,188 --> 00:12:02,979
Speaker 0: new Is Microsoft's choice to make DirectX 10 Vista only a quotes.

214
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,423
Speaker 0: I'm double quoting here.

215
00:12:04,844 --> 00:12:05,826
Speaker 0: terrible mistake.

216
00:12:05,866 --> 00:12:07,210
Speaker 0: That is harmed gaming.

217
00:12:07,872 --> 00:12:12,550
Speaker 1: Well, I think what it is is that the developers want to make DirectX 10 games.

218
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:24,233
Speaker 1: They want to make fancier games or the fancier graphics But making it Vista only means that those sorts of new fancy games are only gonna work on the fancy Vista and a lot of people are resistant to buying Vista.

219
00:12:24,614 --> 00:12:33,970
Speaker 1: thus game developers resist making their games DirectX 10 and The games are held back because Vista doesn't March forward.

220
00:12:34,472 --> 00:12:39,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean basically the argument is that people aren't switching to Vista for various reasons.

221
00:12:39,411 --> 00:12:48,669
Speaker 0: So as a result game developers aren't using DirectX 10 so much because most people don't have an operating system And it's kind of this catch-22 where it'll never get used because no one's using it.

222
00:12:49,371 --> 00:13:03,548
Speaker 0: but at the same time and actually now I saw it at work, but when I get home, they updated the article and Apparently people are pointing out that Windows XP's uptake numbers were somewhat similarly slow when it was first announced and a lot of people stuck with Windows 2000 for a long time.

223
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,222
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, it's sort of true.

224
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:11,810
Speaker 1: when XP came out I had the same feelings about it that I have towards Vista now like a new Windows.

225
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:18,470
Speaker 1: No, it sucks Blair, right and then just eventually it's like alright, I got a blank computer.

226
00:13:18,914 --> 00:13:22,214
Speaker 1: I need a Windows and That's the only windows.

227
00:13:22,254 --> 00:13:27,970
Speaker 1: There is the new one and you just use it and it's not really that much different from the old window.

228
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:31,642
Speaker 0: I mean, I'll end up using Vista whenever I build a new computer.

229
00:13:32,183 --> 00:13:32,444
Speaker 1: Yeah.

230
00:13:32,484 --> 00:13:33,588
Speaker 1: Well, you just built one.

231
00:13:33,608 --> 00:13:38,042
Speaker 0: so five years Yeah, so maybe I'll use this Vista 2020 or whatever.

232
00:13:38,062 --> 00:13:38,786
Speaker 1: I don't know.

233
00:13:38,866 --> 00:13:42,618
Speaker 1: maybe Wista That comes after W. I don't know.

234
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,324
Speaker 1: But yeah, that seems to be.

235
00:13:44,364 --> 00:13:46,090
Speaker 1: the Windows goes is Windows Windows?

236
00:13:46,334 --> 00:13:47,431
Speaker 0: You know Windows

237
00:13:47,472 --> 00:14:02,952
Speaker 1: is a thing that people have to put on computers and the way that they get an install base is by Removing the old version and putting out the new version and over time as people get new computers The old version goes away and the new version comes in even if people don't actively Adopt it.

238
00:14:03,374 --> 00:14:13,469
Speaker 1: However, that's gonna take a couple years and game development and advancement goes a lot faster than that Yep, and it's it is holding back the game developers on the PC.

239
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:16,700
Speaker 1: Also, the Xbox killed PC gaming.

240
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:30,041
Speaker 1: I still while there are many good PC Yeah, really kind of hand-fisted that in there I just always have to say that whenever this issue comes up is despite the bio shocks and The orange boxes and all these things right thing.

241
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:32,129
Speaker 1: all these games are on the Xbox also.

242
00:14:32,691 --> 00:14:38,586
Speaker 0: Okay, see now here's an interesting thing and I wonder about this because I no one.

243
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:42,350
Speaker 0: regardless of whatever people say You know, I don't like Microsoft or Microsoft is evil.

244
00:14:42,771 --> 00:14:49,850
Speaker 0: You can't claim that Microsoft is stupid because Microsoft makes all its money and they know exactly what they're doing most of the time.

245
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,742
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm still pretty sure.

246
00:14:51,762 --> 00:15:05,329
Speaker 1: if you look at PC gaming when the Xbox appeared all the types of games that were big on the PC you know FPS is an RTS and all those things started coming out in the Xbox and they started diminishing from the PC.

247
00:15:05,349 --> 00:15:07,818
Speaker 1: and It's still that way.

248
00:15:08,281 --> 00:15:09,389
Speaker 1: and what you gonna do?

249
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:17,795
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is as we were talking about just before we did the show team forgers - which I've waited for For a long time.

250
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:19,462
Speaker 1: Okay, so I go off on a tangent.

251
00:15:19,482 --> 00:15:21,230
Speaker 1: just cuz I want to and now you're gonna do the same thing.

252
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,053
Speaker 0: Yeah, something like that.

253
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:23,821
Speaker 1: Yeah, the semi unrelated.

254
00:15:23,901 --> 00:15:25,206
Speaker 0: You said the keyword now.

255
00:15:25,246 --> 00:15:25,990
Speaker 0: I got to go in on this.

256
00:15:26,231 --> 00:15:27,999
Speaker 0: Okay, it's actually kind of related to what you said.

257
00:15:28,301 --> 00:15:32,413
Speaker 0: So Team Fortress 2 is coming out on the Xbox Of course and on the PC Now.

258
00:15:32,454 --> 00:15:35,192
Speaker 0: this is one of those games with the online, you know There's not.

259
00:15:35,293 --> 00:15:38,069
Speaker 0: like you play single-player Team Fortress 2 you fight with people.

260
00:15:39,032 --> 00:15:47,430
Speaker 0: Now technically and they've admitted this it is possible and feasible for all Team Fortress 2 people to play against each other Meaning they're already doing it at the valve office.

261
00:15:47,470 --> 00:16:04,888
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean in the meaning that I could in the when the game comes out theoretically log on to a server and some Xbox kid could log on to a server and I could play with my widescreen monitor mouse keyboard scripts and whatnot against a kid with an Xbox controller and a TV.

262
00:16:04,988 --> 00:16:11,410
Speaker 0: and I hope desperately that Microsoft allows this to come to pass

263
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:14,050
Speaker 1: Because they put a little icon next to everyone's name

264
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:27,043
Speaker 0: Because I want all of those kids out there to know and to quake in fear when they realize that if they see that Little PC icon that means I got a mouse and that means that I can shoot them in the head and they can't shoot me In the head, that's

265
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:27,810
Speaker 1: how it's done.

266
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:31,245
Speaker 0: but if I were Microsoft just no way in hell I would let that happen.

267
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:34,929
Speaker 0: because if They they let this happen and you could just play against people.

268
00:16:35,612 --> 00:16:47,190
Speaker 0: It would become pretty apparent to the gaming media pretty quickly that and I I'll stand by the statement That on average people on PCs would be stupidly better at the game than people on the console just because the controls are better.

269
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:55,210
Speaker 1: So the thing is the argument that you could make in that case is hey People who are playing on PCs are more likely to be hardcore gamers with more skills anyway.

270
00:16:55,953 --> 00:17:04,650
Speaker 0: Well that just makes the disparity even worse because even if you put someone I just think that the cap on how good you can Be at an FPS that I'm saying someone might say the controls not the difference.

271
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:09,170
Speaker 1: It's all the better players use the PC not that you know, they're better because the controls are better.

272
00:17:09,511 --> 00:17:13,650
Speaker 0: Well, the way around that is to force people to play on the opposite consoles for a while and see what happened.

273
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:14,361
Speaker 1: That is true.

274
00:17:14,463 --> 00:17:14,868
Speaker 1: That is true.

275
00:17:15,192 --> 00:17:25,733
Speaker 0: But even then even if that were the case people just noticed that Wow PC gamers kick our asses and I wonder if that might make young punk kids think I gotta get me a PC mom Buy me a PC.

276
00:17:25,954 --> 00:17:27,140
Speaker 0: I gotta play Team Fortune on TV.

277
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,085
Speaker 0: Fuck the Xbox.

278
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,013
Speaker 1: Oh Whatever.

279
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:30,636
Speaker 1: It doesn't.

280
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:31,761
Speaker 1: it doesn't really matter right now.

281
00:17:32,063 --> 00:17:32,685
Speaker 0: It matters to me.

282
00:17:32,746 --> 00:17:33,670
Speaker 0: I really care about this.

283
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:38,528
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know there's Darfur and there's a rack and no I care about showing these console kids.

284
00:17:38,568 --> 00:17:39,010
Speaker 0: what for?

285
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:43,645
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess the last thing to say just sort of mandatory is the packs was this weekend.

286
00:17:43,765 --> 00:17:45,130
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, we didn't go.

287
00:17:45,712 --> 00:17:47,619
Speaker 1: Many awesome things happen there.

288
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:54,185
Speaker 1: I watched some YouTube videos and I was as Moved by the videos as I imagined I would have been being there.

289
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,190
Speaker 0: Alright pack staff.

290
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,101
Speaker 0: I'll note lately that we don't go to cons though.

291
00:17:58,141 --> 00:17:59,810
Speaker 0: I mean it's not on purpose.

292
00:17:59,911 --> 00:18:02,770
Speaker 0: We just end up not going to cons unless we're doing some sort of entertainment.

293
00:18:03,971 --> 00:18:06,402
Speaker 0: Get us to be guests at packs and I can guarantee we'll be.

294
00:18:06,442 --> 00:18:09,470
Speaker 1: I think the problem is that all the guests at packs are 10,000 times better than we are.

295
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,277
Speaker 0: I think the only problem is not even that.

296
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:19,590
Speaker 0: packs is the only convention in them in the world Where I don't want to be a guest because I want to go to the con as a person and do all the con stuff.

297
00:18:19,851 --> 00:18:20,133
Speaker 1: I know.

298
00:18:20,213 --> 00:18:22,223
Speaker 0: I don't want to sit at some table and do a show.

299
00:18:22,283 --> 00:18:23,590
Speaker 0: I want to sit there and play video games.

300
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,212
Speaker 1: That's right.

301
00:18:24,292 --> 00:18:28,744
Speaker 1: So I think next year we've decided we're gonna go to packs no matter what.

302
00:18:28,825 --> 00:18:29,266
Speaker 1: I guess not.

303
00:18:29,326 --> 00:18:36,616
Speaker 1: no matter what something crazy Could happen like plane crashes we die Terminally ill in the hospital, etc.

304
00:18:36,656 --> 00:18:41,230
Speaker 1: But other barring that we're going to packs no matter what next year no matter what.

305
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,485
Speaker 1: I'm not committing to that yet, but come on you.

306
00:18:43,505 --> 00:18:44,250
Speaker 1: so I'm going to matter.

307
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,768
Speaker 1: I'll go without you yo, no matter what I'll go in no matter what.

308
00:18:46,788 --> 00:18:48,671
Speaker 0: ah Sure.

309
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:49,514
Speaker 0: All right.

310
00:18:49,555 --> 00:18:49,976
Speaker 0: I'm down.

311
00:18:50,237 --> 00:18:50,799
Speaker 1: It's recorded.

312
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,123
Speaker 0: It is what you gonna do.

313
00:18:52,786 --> 00:18:53,729
Speaker 0: I will know how it is.

314
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,378
Speaker 0: You know, I never thought of that.

315
00:18:58,398 --> 00:19:00,003
Speaker 0: I've never done a malicious edit before.

316
00:19:00,023 --> 00:19:11,034
Speaker 0: yeah, well don't start Things of the day.

317
00:19:11,054 --> 00:19:14,560
Speaker 0: ass Mmm balls.

318
00:19:16,061 --> 00:19:18,528
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, you know, I'm like ass and balls.

319
00:19:18,568 --> 00:19:24,867
Speaker 0: you say actually I wanted to say a more poly syllabic one But I think it's poly syllabic.

320
00:19:25,349 --> 00:19:28,620
Speaker 0: I said a Vic and I'm gonna go with that because it's a syllable.

321
00:19:30,201 --> 00:19:33,180
Speaker 0: Anyway, I can't believe this hasn't been a thing of the day or anything.

322
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,799
Speaker 0: We might have mentioned it now and then but it's kind of like Zombocom just way.

323
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:39,087
Speaker 0: Whoa We never talked about this thing of the day classic.

324
00:19:39,448 --> 00:19:43,764
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if you've seen this before whatever everyone's seen it before We talking about.

325
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:46,819
Speaker 0: ah, a lot of people haven't seen it before I'm sure.

326
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:51,522
Speaker 1: okay I'm sure one person at least one person listen the show hasn't but I think the majority Have.

327
00:19:51,582 --> 00:19:57,580
Speaker 1: because if you're hip enough to the net that you're listening to this podcast on Tuesday You're hip enough to the net to know about this thing.

328
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:13,860
Speaker 0: Well, I would hope so because I'd point out that in the front row crew where we practically worship Horatio hornblower I'm running a game based on that in burning wheel like starting in a month or two and Suddenly it came out of the woodwork that most of the crew has never seen a single episode of that show.

329
00:20:14,002 --> 00:20:19,080
Speaker 1: I know it was so weird Like we watched it as a group in college and we've watched it as a group since then.

330
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,000
Speaker 1: But apparently a lot of people major people haven't seen it is kind of weird.

331
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:24,964
Speaker 0: I find that frightening.

332
00:20:25,004 --> 00:20:28,999
Speaker 0: but no this is my thing of the day the angry video game nerd.

333
00:20:29,581 --> 00:20:34,437
Speaker 0: Basically it is videos of this kid playing shitty old video game really kid.

334
00:20:34,477 --> 00:20:37,167
Speaker 0: I think he's our age Kid guy, he's our age.

335
00:20:37,187 --> 00:20:48,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I can still say kid fine kid guy playing these video games Games such as I don't know Simon's Quest or die hard or Custer's revenge.

336
00:20:49,223 --> 00:20:55,479
Speaker 0: And he reviews them and his style includes shall we say some profanity a little bit.

337
00:20:56,201 --> 00:20:59,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the thing is is profanity is sort of like.

338
00:21:00,432 --> 00:21:01,214
Speaker 1: is profanity?

339
00:21:01,274 --> 00:21:03,660
Speaker 1: is profanity in the same way that Looney Tunes?

340
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,290
Speaker 0: is Violence like instead of saying man fuck shit this game.

341
00:21:07,331 --> 00:21:07,692
Speaker 0: Whatever.

342
00:21:08,073 --> 00:21:12,290
Speaker 0: He'll say things like I'd rather let a buffalo Take a diarrhea dump in my ear.

343
00:21:12,311 --> 00:21:13,376
Speaker 1: That's that's the theme song.

344
00:21:13,678 --> 00:21:20,980
Speaker 1: it is Yeah, but he'll be like this is a pile of cockadookie something in you know, your mother's something I can't do it.

345
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,607
Speaker 1: That's why I'm not the angry video game nerd.

346
00:21:22,627 --> 00:21:28,639
Speaker 0: and he is yeah, and the best part is it's half, you know It's funny the way he talks and he reviews the games really well.

347
00:21:29,143 --> 00:21:41,372
Speaker 0: but the other half of it is pure nostalgia because the first one I ever saw was when he talked about the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game for the NES and Everything he showed was just oh, man.

348
00:21:41,412 --> 00:21:42,015
Speaker 0: I remember that.

349
00:21:42,215 --> 00:21:42,717
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

350
00:21:42,778 --> 00:21:52,188
Speaker 1: I remember that Basically what he goes for most of the time is those incredibly old NES games that were incredibly and frustratingly difficult But as a kid you didn't mind that.

351
00:21:52,268 --> 00:21:58,593
Speaker 1: and now when you get to something like that in a video game You're just like fuck this game, but he goes and he brings you a kid.

352
00:21:58,814 --> 00:22:00,439
Speaker 0: you had what like for video games.

353
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:10,840
Speaker 1: He brings these games up and he Brings you back to the feelings you had when you were a kid in that same incredibly frustratingly difficult spot in the game.

354
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,032
Speaker 1: And you remember and he gets he's like fuck this shit.

355
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:14,895
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

356
00:22:14,936 --> 00:22:16,543
Speaker 1: This is Tara and you're like, yes It was.

357
00:22:16,624 --> 00:22:18,136
Speaker 1: I remember I did the same thing.

358
00:22:18,156 --> 00:22:18,639
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

359
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,020
Speaker 0: I mean, there's one scene where he's like that fuck done and he's biting his NES controller like that.

360
00:22:24,601 --> 00:22:26,346
Speaker 0: And I did that more than once.

361
00:22:26,447 --> 00:22:27,951
Speaker 1: I never bit the NES controller.

362
00:22:28,111 --> 00:22:30,157
Speaker 1: Oh my god our friend Luke.

363
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,047
Speaker 0: I Got a story here.

364
00:22:32,067 --> 00:22:35,925
Speaker 0: This is a nice aside But yeah, angry video game nerd.

365
00:22:36,286 --> 00:22:37,710
Speaker 0: So a biting controllers, right?

366
00:22:38,352 --> 00:22:40,820
Speaker 0: Remember when Advance Wars 1 came out for the GBA?

367
00:22:41,483 --> 00:22:53,935
Speaker 0: Awesome, awesome game, but the advanced campaign, you know, like the I'm hardcore I'm gonna play the hard version was fucking hard and arbitrary like it was crazy Basically, it moved the Advance Wars 1 in the u.s.

368
00:22:54,135 --> 00:23:06,674
Speaker 1: In on the hardest mode Stopped being a tactics turn-based strategy game into a puzzle game with a solution like move this guy here Move this guy there who this guy here, you know down to the spot.

369
00:23:06,734 --> 00:23:08,080
Speaker 1: It had to be perfect and exact.

370
00:23:08,481 --> 00:23:15,665
Speaker 0: so, uh, he was determined to beat this with an s-rank and he did or even just beat it and It was so frustrating.

371
00:23:15,906 --> 00:23:20,480
Speaker 0: and he kind of had this habit where if he lost he'd either squeeze the game or really hard like.

372
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,155
Speaker 0: Or he'd kind of like drive in his mouth and kind of go like I have and bite it a bit.

373
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:35,699
Speaker 0: one day He loses a mission and he goes to his mouth and he goes And then he goes and then he throws the game boy across the room and holds his mouth.

374
00:23:36,601 --> 00:23:42,499
Speaker 0: What had happened was he bit it but his tongue went against that little port and it gave him a little bit of a shock.

375
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:47,162
Speaker 1: Haha, oh and no exaggeration true story He'll admit it.

376
00:23:47,624 --> 00:23:52,120
Speaker 1: he failed graduate school because of Advance Wars 1 for the GBA.

377
00:23:53,621 --> 00:23:54,365
Speaker 0: It's not a joke.

378
00:23:54,406 --> 00:23:55,170
Speaker 1: It's not a joke.

379
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:55,994
Speaker 1: I swear to God.

380
00:23:56,014 --> 00:23:57,040
Speaker 1: It's a hundred percent true.

381
00:23:57,341 --> 00:23:59,616
Speaker 1: Luckily in advance was too much and thus failed.

382
00:23:59,918 --> 00:24:02,069
Speaker 0: luckily It didn't matter because he still got a badass job.

383
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:05,845
Speaker 0: But yeah, actually now he runs an awesome anime store You know, it shows you graduate school.

384
00:24:05,905 --> 00:24:10,620
Speaker 1: not too necessary unless you really want to do something specific like be a doctor or a lawyer.

385
00:24:10,862 --> 00:24:12,655
Speaker 0: I mean, it depends on the field or a dentist.

386
00:24:12,695 --> 00:24:12,977
Speaker 0: He did.

387
00:24:13,058 --> 00:24:16,294
Speaker 0: Okay I think his life was probably better off having not gotten that mask.

388
00:24:16,475 --> 00:24:17,440
Speaker 1: I think so as well.

389
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,725
Speaker 1: Anyway, think of the day for me.

390
00:24:19,186 --> 00:24:22,740
Speaker 1: Do you remember that thing of the day with the guy who said are you a girl?

391
00:24:23,325 --> 00:24:24,160
Speaker 1: Is it Halloween?

392
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,369
Speaker 0: Sexy nun sexy banana sexy whatever.

393
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:32,742
Speaker 1: so I wondered who that guy was and I still haven't totally found out but apparently his name Is Nick.

394
00:24:33,365 --> 00:24:36,440
Speaker 1: I. I guess that's his name of the character everybody.

395
00:24:36,951 --> 00:24:47,980
Speaker 1: But anyway he's made two other videos of that are basically parodies of low-budget commercials and One of them is for a fireworks emporium where there's a crappy rap song and it's okay.

396
00:24:48,422 --> 00:24:54,606
Speaker 1: the other one is for like his winter wonderland where he sells a bunch of Christmas shit and it's See the thing is like.

397
00:24:54,646 --> 00:25:01,140
Speaker 1: I get the feeling it's as funny as the Halloween one But because I've seen the Halloween one it sort of doesn't feel as funny to me.

398
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:14,167
Speaker 1: But if you like that Halloween one from the Goyles costume warehouse You gotta watch these other two videos because even if they're not as funny They're still funny and worth the like five minutes it takes to watch him plus I'll admit whenever someone says Goyles.

399
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:16,094
Speaker 0: I just crack up and I don't know Goyles.

400
00:25:16,255 --> 00:25:17,620
Speaker 0: You should watch Popeye.

401
00:25:18,162 --> 00:25:22,800
Speaker 0: I used to watch Popeye, but you're the one who's never seen the live-action Popeye movie with Robin Williams.

402
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:25,149
Speaker 1: No, I've never seen a live-action Popeye.

403
00:25:25,209 --> 00:25:25,812
Speaker 1: No, but you know what?

404
00:25:25,832 --> 00:25:27,759
Speaker 1: I'm thinking about buying Robin Williams.

405
00:25:28,281 --> 00:25:31,813
Speaker 1: I'm thinking about buying this box set of incredibly old Popeye cartoons.

406
00:25:31,994 --> 00:25:33,378
Speaker 0: I really like the Aladdin one.

407
00:25:33,418 --> 00:25:37,814
Speaker 1: I remember that There's also an incredibly old Popeye like comic collection book.

408
00:25:37,874 --> 00:25:39,580
Speaker 1: I'm thinking about buying - I don't I don't know.

409
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,340
Speaker 1: I'm gonna buy one of the other I think probably the cartoon.

410
00:25:41,501 --> 00:25:44,359
Speaker 0: Ah before we go on I just got to say the angry video game nerd.

411
00:25:44,784 --> 00:25:51,080
Speaker 0: I think I might link to it specifically But if I don't if you haven't seen this before before you watch anything else that guy's done.

412
00:25:51,462 --> 00:25:53,491
Speaker 0: Go watch the one about Bible games.

413
00:25:53,672 --> 00:25:55,320
Speaker 1: No go watch the one about Silver Surfer.

414
00:25:55,903 --> 00:25:59,140
Speaker 1: You know, we always talk about how incredibly difficult Silver Surfer is.

415
00:25:59,501 --> 00:26:01,569
Speaker 1: I think he put it best in his Silver Surfer review.

416
00:26:01,589 --> 00:26:04,440
Speaker 0: The difficulty of this game is legendary.

417
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,879
Speaker 1: Difficulty is legendary.

418
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:12,960
Speaker 0: This way if you're a gamer like straight-up video gamer watch the Silver Surfer one because it's mostly yeah, fuck that game.

419
00:26:13,602 --> 00:26:19,217
Speaker 0: But if you're just looking for humor watch the Bible games one and watch it all the way through.

420
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:32,400
Speaker 1: trust me on this Because when he's throwing that rock at those animals And he is still making these because he just came out with the Atari porn one Oh my god, Atari porn and he's still he's still got he's still on the ball.

421
00:26:32,461 --> 00:26:35,182
Speaker 1: All his videos are as good as they always were All right.

422
00:26:35,684 --> 00:26:40,300
Speaker 1: today we're gonna talk about the new Wii game the Mario strikers charge.

423
00:26:40,942 --> 00:26:43,673
Speaker 0: We kind of held off since we wanted to play it enough to get a full course.

424
00:26:43,693 --> 00:26:45,320
Speaker 1: We didn't play it so much more.

425
00:26:45,722 --> 00:26:46,445
Speaker 0: I played it a bunch.

426
00:26:46,485 --> 00:26:47,752
Speaker 0: I played it online a little bit.

427
00:26:48,415 --> 00:26:49,300
Speaker 0: I understand the game.

428
00:26:49,521 --> 00:26:58,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically this is a sequel a direct sequel to the other Mario strikers for the GameCube Which is the first one and it's pretty much the same game.

429
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,649
Speaker 1: But they have made you.

430
00:27:01,071 --> 00:27:02,840
Speaker 1: we did a review on that original one, didn't we?

431
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:03,803
Speaker 0: So yeah, we did.

432
00:27:03,843 --> 00:27:06,939
Speaker 1: you go listen to that and it's pretty much the same game.

433
00:27:07,481 --> 00:27:14,443
Speaker 1: But it does have significant changes and I think those significant changes make the game Superior.

434
00:27:14,483 --> 00:27:14,623
Speaker 1: sort.

435
00:27:14,643 --> 00:27:22,979
Speaker 1: of the same way the GameCube Mario tennis was better than the N64 Mario or how Smash Brothers Melee was better than just the original Smash Brothers.

436
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:30,096
Speaker 1: Yep So this is an incremental improvement on the other Mario strikers and there's pretty much no reason to play the old one now that we Have the new one.

437
00:27:30,642 --> 00:27:32,027
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I'll for one.

438
00:27:32,087 --> 00:27:33,854
Speaker 0: if you like the old one just buy the new one.

439
00:27:33,874 --> 00:27:35,240
Speaker 0: don't even question you have a way.

440
00:27:35,421 --> 00:27:38,780
Speaker 1: I mean if you don't have a Wii this is not a game that is so good.

441
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,966
Speaker 1: You should buy a Wii to play it.

442
00:27:40,026 --> 00:27:41,051
Speaker 0: No, those games are coming.

443
00:27:41,152 --> 00:27:42,800
Speaker 1: You should wait until there are more games.

444
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,020
Speaker 1: You know wait until there's strikers Wii Sports.

445
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,713
Speaker 1: We got those two after Metroid and may and brawl come out.

446
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:51,780
Speaker 1: then you can buying a Wii will be worth the money.

447
00:27:52,302 --> 00:27:54,430
Speaker 1: but right now this if you have a Wii get the game.

448
00:27:54,932 --> 00:27:57,603
Speaker 1: if you don't have a Wii don't run out and buy one for This and two.

449
00:27:57,684 --> 00:28:04,692
Speaker 0: if you didn't listen to our old review or you think you don't like sports games one This is Mario sports are not sports games.

450
00:28:04,873 --> 00:28:06,540
Speaker 1: Don't tell yourself that they are.

451
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:13,231
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean if you don't like those Madden whatever games, don't worry about it Yeah, if you don't like say FIFA, whatever.

452
00:28:13,251 --> 00:28:15,418
Speaker 1: This is nothing like a sports game.

453
00:28:15,479 --> 00:28:17,245
Speaker 1: This is Something else.

454
00:28:17,507 --> 00:28:19,780
Speaker 0: So before we get into the game, it's a lot more like NBA Jam.

455
00:28:20,182 --> 00:28:24,360
Speaker 0: We talked about this a lot when we reviewed the original and it's it's times 10. in this game.

456
00:28:24,801 --> 00:28:35,520
Speaker 0: The style and the character design and all the little extras in the game that don't actually affect gameplay are So important and this is one of the reasons why Nintendo's first-party games tend to kick everyone's asses.

457
00:28:36,062 --> 00:28:40,100
Speaker 0: They went the extra mile and there's so much in this game that doesn't directly affect gameplay.

458
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:49,782
Speaker 0: But just the way the characters move and the way they talk to you and the way they yell at each other and the way They react when they get a goal or when they miss a goal or when they miss a shot is Just.

459
00:28:50,325 --> 00:28:52,820
Speaker 0: it adds so much to the experience that you'd be surprised.

460
00:28:52,969 --> 00:28:53,140
Speaker 0: Yeah

461
00:28:53,260 --> 00:29:06,900
Speaker 1: I mean the first one had all that going on full on and the new one has it going on even more Except I think that the way they've designed the character models wearing all that armor I like the old way better where they were just sort of sporty but with attitude.

462
00:29:07,141 --> 00:29:09,376
Speaker 1: But other than that everything about the new one is better.

463
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:10,040
Speaker 1: in those respects.

464
00:29:10,141 --> 00:29:16,008
Speaker 1: I mean every character sort of has like their own music and it's like each one has a different kind of music.

465
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:21,429
Speaker 1: like Mario has some rock and roll and Luigi has like like a hat dance kind of thing.

466
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:25,887
Speaker 0: and you know, Luigi is like Desperado coming down from the sky.

467
00:29:25,968 --> 00:29:27,393
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's that's what I'm talking about.

468
00:29:27,413 --> 00:29:28,457
Speaker 0: And a kid Koopa is all.

469
00:29:28,497 --> 00:29:30,183
Speaker 0: Quentin Tarantino You feel like he's just.

470
00:29:30,263 --> 00:29:30,765
Speaker 0: oh, yeah.

471
00:29:30,885 --> 00:29:34,677
Speaker 1: Yeah freaking princess like peaches like a Deva.

472
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:35,259
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah

473
00:29:36,463 --> 00:29:53,863
Speaker 1: Daisy sort of techno and all the music no matter what genre it is or which character you've picked is Totally intense and builds up the energy sort of like the way music in a you know A sports stadium builds you up, which is what you should do in a sports game Sporting arena.

474
00:29:53,883 --> 00:29:55,970
Speaker 0: while Luigi's all banjo II I really like his.

475
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:58,879
Speaker 1: yeah, it's banjo II but somehow it builds energy in.

476
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:00,811
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's get it on.

477
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:03,043
Speaker 0: and much like the other game The character is just.

478
00:30:03,484 --> 00:30:07,277
Speaker 0: you know, every Nintendo sports or Mario Kart Mario Tennis, whatever.

479
00:30:07,618 --> 00:30:11,376
Speaker 0: They're good games They're great games, but the characters are still just Mario.

480
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:12,823
Speaker 0: It's a me a Mario It's nothing.

481
00:30:13,084 --> 00:30:13,968
Speaker 0: they don't go beyond that.

482
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:20,256
Speaker 0: these games these Mario strikers games Go one step past that and the characters have attitude.

483
00:30:20,577 --> 00:30:24,411
Speaker 0: They're pissy Sometimes they're hardcore and they want to kick your ass.

484
00:30:24,872 --> 00:30:27,100
Speaker 1: That's I think what's necessary for a soccer game.

485
00:30:28,144 --> 00:30:31,518
Speaker 0: When Yoshi looks at you and he's like, I'm gonna kick your ass and you stink.

486
00:30:31,678 --> 00:30:33,247
Speaker 0: Oh crap He's coming to kick my ass.

487
00:30:33,569 --> 00:30:35,159
Speaker 0: You don't get that in any other Nintendo game.

488
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:44,675
Speaker 1: Yeah, when you get like, you know kid Koopa giving you like the old slit throat like yeah bitches I think my favorite thing in the whole game and Wario farts at you.

489
00:30:44,916 --> 00:30:54,820
Speaker 0: Oh my god My favorite thing is something like when someone makes a shot It shows whoever made the shot like celebrating and everyone celebrates in a bunch of different ways and they're really funny and they're really good.

490
00:30:55,433 --> 00:31:00,052
Speaker 0: but Wario and kid Koopa have two of the greatest.

491
00:31:00,252 --> 00:31:00,654
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

492
00:31:00,674 --> 00:31:02,260
Speaker 0: We're losing the game animations.

493
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,167
Speaker 0: Wario just fucking commit suicide.

494
00:31:05,227 --> 00:31:08,558
Speaker 0: He's like, I cannot go on and he pulls out a bomb and blows himself up.

495
00:31:09,641 --> 00:31:23,283
Speaker 0: Kid Koopa just like it shows like a like a camera view of his face and then he punches the camera and then it cuts To another camera and he's just attacking all the press cameras around him and yelling It's just So great.

496
00:31:23,665 --> 00:31:24,387
Speaker 1: It is pretty great.

497
00:31:24,407 --> 00:31:26,314
Speaker 1: All right, let's talk about the actual gameplay going on.

498
00:31:26,374 --> 00:31:29,284
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz the actual game All right.

499
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:34,820
Speaker 1: Now if you've played a soccer game before any sort of hockey's maybe even a basketball game before right?

500
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:48,380
Speaker 1: it's sort of like, you know, you're passing you're shooting you're moving right and You're also sort of defending the goal or the net in some way, you know Like if you play ice hockey for the NES, you sort of got to control your guys and control the goalie.

501
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,695
Speaker 1: Well, like the original strikers you don't control your goalie at all.

502
00:31:52,715 --> 00:31:53,799
Speaker 1: Your goalie is automatic.

503
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,862
Speaker 0: now I really like that.

504
00:31:54,882 --> 00:32:03,340
Speaker 1: I like that because controlling a goalie has always been annoying and It basically making me not have to do that is kind of okay.

505
00:32:03,601 --> 00:32:08,940
Speaker 1: But you're always worrying like okay now the game I whether I win or lose depends on this.

506
00:32:09,262 --> 00:32:11,018
Speaker 1: You know goalie that's controlled by an AI.

507
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,063
Speaker 1: I might suck.

508
00:32:12,504 --> 00:32:17,299
Speaker 0: the game is so well crafted that one the goalies really good and stuff's not gonna just randomly get in.

509
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:24,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, and two the D. how well your defense is depends a lot more on how your defenseman play and how you get them.

510
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:30,307
Speaker 1: I think I think this is where the game makes a serious improvement on the original Strikers and the original strikers.

511
00:32:30,347 --> 00:32:33,260
Speaker 1: they were like you could set it up where you just score because you knew how to what you could.

512
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:41,884
Speaker 1: Oh, you could like pass and position your guys in a certain way to be like pass Lob pass kick in the out of the air and it would just go in most of the time Right.

513
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:43,219
Speaker 1: and the new one.

514
00:32:43,681 --> 00:32:55,980
Speaker 1: They have this system of charging up the ball in addition to a bunch of other things like skill shots and charge up shots And items to where it's not so much a game of score right beat the goalie.

515
00:32:56,543 --> 00:32:58,714
Speaker 1: It's a game of you know the ball.

516
00:32:58,734 --> 00:33:00,950
Speaker 1: if you just shoot the ball It will never go in.

517
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:03,322
Speaker 1: if you just walk and shoot it you have to play.

518
00:33:03,362 --> 00:33:14,989
Speaker 1: you have to make a play in the field which is not easy and takes a significant amount of time and Unless you make a play in the field Your chance of the ball going in the net when you eventually shoot is pretty much nil.

519
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:17,870
Speaker 1: So it's pretty much the game becomes.

520
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:30,720
Speaker 1: You are trying to make a play in the field when you have the ball and when you don't have the ball You're trying to prevent the other player from making a play in the field and it's all this Offensive and defensive maneuvering in the field.

521
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,930
Speaker 1: and then the actual shooting is pretty much like I've made the play.

522
00:33:34,071 --> 00:33:35,797
Speaker 1: All I have to do is push shoot and it'll go in.

523
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:39,819
Speaker 1: you know eighty percent of the or ninety percent depending on how good your play was.

524
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:47,110
Speaker 1: and That's and I've never seen a game that handles it that way before and it's really great.

525
00:33:47,533 --> 00:33:51,547
Speaker 0: Yeah, because ice hockey is really fun But you know the original ice hockey for the NES.

526
00:33:51,809 --> 00:34:01,809
Speaker 0: yeah but the game gets to the point where the only thing that matters is how good of a goaltender you are and There's not so much maneuvering on the field and granted that's a simple game But most sports games are like that.

527
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:03,878
Speaker 0: This game is just focused down to this.

528
00:34:03,999 --> 00:34:10,590
Speaker 0: one aspect of play which I would argue in Football or soccer depending on what country you're in is the most fun part.

529
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:25,585
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean when you watch like a sporting event, right if someone just like scores and scores and scores, you know Normally, that's why I always got bored with a lot of sports games because eventually you figure out the trick to just score a lot And you just keep doing that trick over and over again in the games over.

530
00:34:26,007 --> 00:34:28,449
Speaker 1: in this There is no trick to just score a lot.

531
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:32,042
Speaker 1: You have to make a play and you can't just make the same identical play.

532
00:34:32,081 --> 00:34:44,027
Speaker 1: because like just a pass and a shot is not A play a play is like, you know pass pass pass charge up shoot rebound pass Lob in the air shoot, you know, and it's not like the same thing every time you have to.

533
00:34:44,128 --> 00:34:53,549
Speaker 1: you know I mean keep the ball moving and do some tricks and things to sort of build it up and Pull something off without the ball getting stolen or without your guys getting hit.

534
00:34:53,589 --> 00:34:56,690
Speaker 0: now That's also hit with an item the really fun part that you know.

535
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:59,910
Speaker 0: We said you charge up the ball anytime you take direct action on the ball.

536
00:35:00,271 --> 00:35:03,485
Speaker 0: It adds energy to it and eventually turns white meaning it's fully charged.

537
00:35:03,967 --> 00:35:06,784
Speaker 0: and the more charged It is the better chance it as of going in.

538
00:35:06,824 --> 00:35:14,636
Speaker 0: if someone makes a shot But at the same time a white shot is not going to automatically go in because how close you are Where the goalie is.

539
00:35:14,656 --> 00:35:21,905
Speaker 0: I mean if the goal is distracted for whatever reason like from a rebound shot Then even a low-powered shots gonna go in because the goal is in the wrong spot.

540
00:35:21,925 --> 00:35:31,170
Speaker 0: He can't get there in time Yep, but to the charge keeps the energy going because once you're making an offensive play You can't just back off and then try again.

541
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:32,155
Speaker 0: You got to keep pushing.

542
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:40,896
Speaker 0: keep pushing because if they grab the ball from you It's still fully charged because you charged it up and now they're coming straight for that again Like let's say they grab the ball from you.

543
00:35:40,916 --> 00:35:44,890
Speaker 1: Like if the goalie catches the ball, right it immediately starts losing charge.

544
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:54,520
Speaker 1: So the game encourages you to keep making lots of action and not just like sit around and bide your time And you know walk around in circles or anything.

545
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,870
Speaker 0: It's great for rebounds because it's like rebound rebound.

546
00:35:57,991 --> 00:36:00,437
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you shoot shooting charges the ball up.

547
00:36:00,498 --> 00:36:01,801
Speaker 1: passing charges the ball up.

548
00:36:01,861 --> 00:36:04,528
Speaker 1: charging charging shots charge the ball up.

549
00:36:04,589 --> 00:36:05,880
Speaker 0: doing things Charges the ball up.

550
00:36:05,901 --> 00:36:06,529
Speaker 1: All right.

551
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:11,910
Speaker 1: Another thing I had to talk about in this game of the skill shots which are new and awesome and they actually take skill.

552
00:36:12,053 --> 00:36:14,416
Speaker 1: basically Your second you you.

553
00:36:14,757 --> 00:36:18,470
Speaker 1: the way it worked in the original strikers is you would choose a team leader and teammates.

554
00:36:18,791 --> 00:36:21,359
Speaker 1: So for example, you choose Luigi and and booze.

555
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:24,790
Speaker 1: you'd have one Luigi and three booze on your team and this one.

556
00:36:25,031 --> 00:36:30,190
Speaker 1: There are a lot more teammates and a lot more team leaders and you can mix up your teammates.

557
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:35,154
Speaker 1: you can have like a boo a hammer brother and a Goon, not a goon.

558
00:36:35,274 --> 00:36:35,937
Speaker 0: Not a goon.

559
00:36:35,957 --> 00:36:37,683
Speaker 0: Goon would be useless in soccer.

560
00:36:37,844 --> 00:36:40,578
Speaker 1: I know right all he has his feet There was the ball hit him.

561
00:36:40,618 --> 00:36:41,142
Speaker 0: That's the end.

562
00:36:41,162 --> 00:36:42,269
Speaker 1: You can headbutt it really well.

563
00:36:43,196 --> 00:36:52,954
Speaker 1: I know that head butting Mario from the bottom Like your team could be a Birdo a mole man and a hammer brother or and Waluigi or two booze and A Koopa Troopa.

564
00:36:53,014 --> 00:36:54,842
Speaker 1: and then Luigi and they all have different.

565
00:36:54,943 --> 00:36:55,987
Speaker 0: I always play Luigi's.

566
00:36:56,027 --> 00:36:56,570
Speaker 1: That's my exam.

567
00:36:56,921 --> 00:37:00,882
Speaker 1: Yeah But each sidekick right the main player.

568
00:37:00,922 --> 00:37:06,884
Speaker 1: when they charge the ball up when they do a charge shot They hold down the shoot button for the maximum amount of time and let go.

569
00:37:06,905 --> 00:37:09,148
Speaker 1: they do the super strike Which we'll talk about in a minute.

570
00:37:09,752 --> 00:37:18,930
Speaker 1: but if the secondary players charge up all the way and let go they do the skill shot and each Player each secondary teammate has a different skill shot.

571
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:26,701
Speaker 1: And the reason it's a skill shot is because you have to sort of use it at the right with the right Timing in the right position and if you do it just right.

572
00:37:26,741 --> 00:37:29,470
Speaker 1: you can get a goal pretty easily, but it's not easy.

573
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,018
Speaker 1: It's a skill shot for a reason.

574
00:37:31,058 --> 00:37:33,410
Speaker 1: It takes a lot of skill and the skill shots are awesome

575
00:37:33,711 --> 00:37:45,547
Speaker 0: Yep, and also real quick because it's kind of related to that in the old game, you know You get items any time someone else Checks you or kicks you or something and you didn't have the ball if you did an illegal hit.

576
00:37:46,069 --> 00:37:47,213
Speaker 0: in this game They still have that.

577
00:37:47,554 --> 00:37:58,784
Speaker 0: but also just before you get a skill shot the ball like flashes for a second And if you sure to shoot during that span instead of doing a skill shot You take a shot on the goal and it charges the ball and you get an item.

578
00:37:58,804 --> 00:38:03,703
Speaker 0: so you can build up items Just by taking shots on the other person's goal and make it play.

579
00:38:03,723 --> 00:38:05,590
Speaker 1: So the other guy can't starve you of items.

580
00:38:06,432 --> 00:38:10,116
Speaker 1: alright now let's talk about the The waggle whatnots?

581
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:12,062
Speaker 1: that is so people call it right.

582
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:14,830
Speaker 1: how does the Wii work into this game for the Wii one?

583
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:16,636
Speaker 0: You don't have to do any of that if you don't want.

584
00:38:16,676 --> 00:38:20,650
Speaker 1: Yes, basically, it's actually you know, forget about the weakness, right?

585
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:21,508
Speaker 1: Think about it.

586
00:38:21,771 --> 00:38:31,397
Speaker 1: the controls are pretty similar to the GameCube controls except now you're using the Wiimote in your right hand or you know your primary hand I guess and The nunchuck in the other hand.

587
00:38:31,417 --> 00:38:37,706
Speaker 1: so it's sort of like if the GameCube controller was split in half So you could move your hands around more freely and there was just a wire connecting them.

588
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:38,530
Speaker 1: and it's wireless.

589
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:45,940
Speaker 1: so it's actually a lot more comfortable than just the GameCube and Most of the controls of the GameCube are very similar or the same.

590
00:38:46,402 --> 00:38:47,887
Speaker 1: So it's not much different.

591
00:38:47,947 --> 00:38:48,750
Speaker 1: It's just more comfortable.

592
00:38:48,971 --> 00:38:54,470
Speaker 0: The only really waggling is when you want to tackle someone you can hit a button or you can shake the stick.

593
00:38:54,531 --> 00:38:58,739
Speaker 1: And well the difference is if you hit a button Just to tackle you do a slide tackle.

594
00:38:58,819 --> 00:39:03,290
Speaker 1: if you shake the Wiimote you do the hitting tackle Right, so that's sort of different.

595
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:10,270
Speaker 1: But I've actually I mostly use the slide tackle because the hitting tackle is only useful in other in specific situations.

596
00:39:10,411 --> 00:39:12,549
Speaker 1: So I find myself using the slide tackle a lot more.

597
00:39:13,293 --> 00:39:16,810
Speaker 1: You can also if you take the nunchuck and you shake it a little bit.

598
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:31,898
Speaker 1: That's how you change items when it sort of feels good to change items that way because it's sort of like, you know flipping through items like You know sort of like changing cartridges in a gun or whatever and that's pretty much it except For the mega strike.

599
00:39:32,421 --> 00:39:39,606
Speaker 0: All right now in the previous game The mega strike was pretty much if you got it off It was automatic goal and it was worth two points.

600
00:39:39,626 --> 00:39:40,250
Speaker 0: That was the point.

601
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:49,408
Speaker 0: It was either two points or no point and it was kind of bad because once you got good at the game The strategy was just get right over the center line super shot right over the center line.

602
00:39:49,608 --> 00:39:53,650
Speaker 1: super shot I'm saying is if you're playing with good people they could stop you from doing the super shot.

603
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:58,890
Speaker 1: The problem is if you got it off two goals No one could do anything about it and you had to sit there and watch this animation.

604
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:01,001
Speaker 1: That was unskippable to get two goals.

605
00:40:01,122 --> 00:40:02,288
Speaker 0: and yeah also real quick.

606
00:40:02,308 --> 00:40:12,404
Speaker 0: in this game They got rid of that slow-mo all the time Which I'm pretty sure was only in the GameCube because the guy I think it was I think the slow-mo and the GameCube one Was for dramatic effect, but I think I think I think they over.

607
00:40:12,504 --> 00:40:13,570
Speaker 1: it was definitely overused.

608
00:40:13,831 --> 00:40:21,657
Speaker 1: I think it was partly also to deal with the processor not being I don't think it had a problem with that because you could Play a whole game without slow-mo as it was the.

609
00:40:21,737 --> 00:40:28,970
Speaker 1: the reason slow-mo happened is if you did like a big pass and then You did you know like a like a one-timer shot?

610
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:33,530
Speaker 0: That's when it would do the slow-mo, but also every time I did the slow-mo there was like that effect around the character.

611
00:40:34,471 --> 00:40:35,797
Speaker 1: What it was a special effect?

612
00:40:35,878 --> 00:40:37,083
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe they couldn't do that.

613
00:40:37,385 --> 00:40:37,867
Speaker 1: I don't know.

614
00:40:37,887 --> 00:40:38,490
Speaker 1: I don't think so.

615
00:40:38,671 --> 00:40:39,556
Speaker 0: Anyway, they got rid of that.

616
00:40:39,576 --> 00:40:42,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, this slow-mo now, but it happens much less.

617
00:40:42,291 --> 00:40:45,068
Speaker 1: It's super rare and it's it's only for dramatic effect.

618
00:40:45,832 --> 00:40:46,736
Speaker 1: But what they do?

619
00:40:46,756 --> 00:40:47,680
Speaker 1: this the mega strike.

620
00:40:47,721 --> 00:41:05,820
Speaker 1: in the new one the way it works is you charge up But with your main team guy your team leader And you charge up all the way and you charge up all the way in a meter appears and the meter is very similar to The meter in the old one, but when the meter goes to the left it go it counts up three four five six And you push the button when it's at the number you want.

621
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:09,909
Speaker 1: now the number that you stop it on is the number of balls You're going to shoot.

622
00:41:10,371 --> 00:41:15,870
Speaker 1: So if you push it on the three, you're only gonna shoot three shots, but it doesn't take long.

623
00:41:16,191 --> 00:41:20,350
Speaker 1: So if another guy's coming to hit you and make easy if he hits you you're gonna get no shots.

624
00:41:20,773 --> 00:41:21,739
Speaker 1: So do you push the ball?

625
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,041
Speaker 1: quit.

626
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:23,209
Speaker 1: you push the button real soon?

627
00:41:23,551 --> 00:41:27,630
Speaker 1: So, you know you get three shots off or do you hold out to try to get four five or six shots?

628
00:41:28,112 --> 00:41:28,767
Speaker 1: That's pretty cool.

629
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:40,043
Speaker 1: then after you push it to select how many shots you're gonna take it goes back to the right and you try to stop it when It's in the green or the yellow area and that determines how fast the shots are gonna be

630
00:41:40,645 --> 00:41:42,230
Speaker 0: and in the way it works out.

631
00:41:42,531 --> 00:41:45,870
Speaker 0: Well first we'll talk about how you fight him off if you're a player because you get the shot off.

632
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,216
Speaker 1: This is the other waggly bit.

633
00:41:47,397 --> 00:41:52,841
Speaker 0: awesome animation happens and now and this might sound dumb But I'm bear with me cuz I'm gonna defend it.

634
00:41:52,882 --> 00:41:53,886
Speaker 0: It works out really well.

635
00:41:54,087 --> 00:41:54,730
Speaker 1: Oh you think it works.

636
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:55,836
Speaker 1: Well, I think it works out.

637
00:41:55,896 --> 00:41:56,218
Speaker 1: Okay.

638
00:41:56,359 --> 00:41:58,510
Speaker 0: I think it works a lot better than a lot of other ways.

639
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:02,630
Speaker 1: They could have handled it does but I do feel like it is a tacked on waggle thing.

640
00:42:02,852 --> 00:42:04,426
Speaker 0: Oh it is but what else could they have done?

641
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:06,436
Speaker 1: Not waggle then.

642
00:42:06,456 --> 00:42:07,039
Speaker 0: What are you gonna do?

643
00:42:07,341 --> 00:42:09,070
Speaker 1: No, you just make it strikers game for the Wii.

644
00:42:09,172 --> 00:42:09,786
Speaker 1: What's wrong with that?

645
00:42:10,171 --> 00:42:15,050
Speaker 0: Because I didn't like the fact that it was deterministic like it's just gonna go in automatically if you get the good thing.

646
00:42:15,312 --> 00:42:15,937
Speaker 1: That is true.

647
00:42:15,998 --> 00:42:16,502
Speaker 1: That is true.

648
00:42:16,522 --> 00:42:17,530
Speaker 0: That's the only thing I didn't like.

649
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:24,740
Speaker 0: There's got to be some sort of like mini game or skill or something to block those super shots And they could have done it another way.

650
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,750
Speaker 0: I think this is a pretty good quick elegant way.

651
00:42:26,851 --> 00:42:27,640
Speaker 1: It's an okay way.

652
00:42:27,903 --> 00:42:28,570
Speaker 0: It works pretty well.

653
00:42:28,631 --> 00:42:46,776
Speaker 0: The way it works is You've got it You've got a little hands on the screen that you control with the remote and it gives you a countdown and you have to click Before it'll start and the balls come at you and you have to block them and depending on where they got on the meter Is how fast they'll come at you and it's basically if they didn't hit the good part Like the green part of the orange part.

654
00:42:47,278 --> 00:42:50,890
Speaker 0: You can block them all like just whatever unless you suck unless you're a moron.

655
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:51,131
Speaker 0: It's

656
00:42:51,171 --> 00:43:08,565
Speaker 1: basically sort of like a mini game of duck hunt where the Ducks sort of appear in one spot for like part a fraction of a second and you sort of have to shoot them all really quick and it's actually not that hard because you can sort of see the where they're coming from and If you if you practice at it super shots won't really pass by you so much.

657
00:43:08,625 --> 00:43:15,420
Speaker 0: Yep, and then the green area, you know It's pretty hard, but you'll usually get all of them if you're a good player most of them Most of them to where you're not just done.

658
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, six shots go in game over.

659
00:43:17,571 --> 00:43:25,480
Speaker 0: But if you get it into the orange one, which is pretty hard to do But I've practiced the hell out of doing that It's you're lucky if you block half of them.

660
00:43:25,901 --> 00:43:26,263
Speaker 1: Yeah.

661
00:43:26,464 --> 00:43:29,541
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's The thing is it's good.

662
00:43:29,561 --> 00:43:30,610
Speaker 1: It's hard to get it in the orange.

663
00:43:30,911 --> 00:43:36,130
Speaker 1: And also if someone gets it in the orange you left them wide open on the field and we're not playing defense.

664
00:43:36,236 --> 00:43:36,364
Speaker 1: Yeah.

665
00:43:37,032 --> 00:43:41,930
Speaker 0: Also if they get off more than three or four shots you again left them out there and it's your own goddamn fault.

666
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:43,283
Speaker 1: They get off any shots on this.

667
00:43:43,344 --> 00:43:45,737
Speaker 1: on the mega thing Then you weren't playing defense properly.

668
00:43:45,757 --> 00:43:50,437
Speaker 1: it when I noticed when we play with people who know what they're doing almost No one gets a mega strike off ever.

669
00:43:50,617 --> 00:43:53,409
Speaker 1: It's it's like people try but then they always get hit every time.

670
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:55,055
Speaker 1: Yeah items at the very least.

671
00:43:55,557 --> 00:43:59,350
Speaker 0: The only other thing I could really talk about is the fact that it has Wi-Fi play.

672
00:43:59,966 --> 00:44:07,518
Speaker 1: Yeah I played the Wi-Fi play once and it was kind of fun because you are playing the full game against someone on the internet and It is a contest of skill and awesome.

673
00:44:07,538 --> 00:44:07,719
Speaker 0: Yes.

674
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,970
Speaker 1: It just works, but it just works.

675
00:44:10,311 --> 00:44:23,870
Speaker 1: The only thing I can complain about is that I played it and it didn't seem so bad when I was playing it and it Said you have a four star internet speed rating, but when I actually went back to playing the single-player game I realized that the internet play was mad laggy.

676
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:28,129
Speaker 1: I only did it once so it could have been just that time but it could also been who you were playing against.

677
00:44:28,149 --> 00:44:30,345
Speaker 1: it could Have been but it was pretty laggy.

678
00:44:30,426 --> 00:44:36,244
Speaker 1: So Laggyness in a game like this is not really the greatest but at the same time demands no lads.

679
00:44:36,285 --> 00:44:37,830
Speaker 0: basing that on one play.

680
00:44:38,352 --> 00:44:39,375
Speaker 1: Yes, I'll have to play more.

681
00:44:39,415 --> 00:44:40,539
Speaker 1: Wi-Fi is to figure it out.

682
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:43,710
Speaker 0: cuz I played one Wi-Fi and I didn't notice any lag.

683
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:44,273
Speaker 0: I just played.

684
00:44:44,313 --> 00:44:44,897
Speaker 0: it seemed pretty good.

685
00:44:44,937 --> 00:44:45,782
Speaker 0: kid kicked my ass.

686
00:44:45,802 --> 00:44:50,389
Speaker 1: But yeah, yeah I actually had a pretty close one, but I played it on the day the game came out in the u.s.

687
00:44:50,671 --> 00:44:52,621
Speaker 0: So yeah, I've been practicing so much.

688
00:44:52,761 --> 00:44:53,666
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've been practicing either.

689
00:44:53,686 --> 00:44:55,807
Speaker 1: been playing for Mario Good God.

690
00:44:56,612 --> 00:44:57,884
Speaker 1: Anything else you wanna say about strikers?

691
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:58,973
Speaker 0: It's not so much I can say.

692
00:44:59,013 --> 00:45:00,924
Speaker 0: I just I highly recommend this game.

693
00:45:00,985 --> 00:45:02,995
Speaker 0: if you own a Wii It's a must-buy.

694
00:45:03,317 --> 00:45:05,045
Speaker 0: if you don't own a Wii it's a must-buy.

695
00:45:05,246 --> 00:45:07,621
Speaker 0: after you get a Wii It's not a reason to get a Wii.

696
00:45:07,641 --> 00:45:11,635
Speaker 0: like Scott said, yep, and Yeah, good soccer game me.

697
00:45:11,696 --> 00:45:13,902
Speaker 1: It might be the best soccer game.

698
00:45:13,942 --> 00:45:15,346
Speaker 1: There is except maybe that one.

699
00:45:15,507 --> 00:45:16,610
Speaker 1: That was all River City rants.

700
00:45:16,731 --> 00:45:20,749
Speaker 0: I just wish Nintendo would use that kind of style or that kind of.

701
00:45:20,769 --> 00:45:23,890
Speaker 0: you know Make the characters a little hardcore make them kind of competitive.

702
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:26,680
Speaker 1: It doesn't have to make them hardcore necessarily just make them different.

703
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,186
Speaker 1: make them not the standard.

704
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,250
Speaker 1: It's a medium audio.

705
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:30,615
Speaker 0: Stylize it a little bit.
