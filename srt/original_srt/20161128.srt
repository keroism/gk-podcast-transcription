1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,710
Speaker 1: It's Monday November 28th 2016.

2
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:15,400
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:15,881 --> 00:00:16,744
Speaker 1: It's that time.

4
00:00:17,186 --> 00:00:18,410
Speaker 1: It's computer buying time.

5
00:00:20,943 --> 00:00:21,977
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,144 --> 00:00:28,138
Speaker 0: So at work my computer is this Lenovo x220?

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,646
Speaker 0: For working that's just fine.

8
00:00:31,947 --> 00:00:35,980
Speaker 0: That's just fine for working because I'm not doing any 3ds or any games or any anything.

9
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,146
Speaker 0: I'm just typing text.

10
00:00:37,307 --> 00:00:38,955
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I you looking at websites.

11
00:00:39,075 --> 00:00:45,182
Speaker 1: I use the x230 And I like edit video on it, and it's not great, but it's not that much faster than the head I.

12
00:00:45,323 --> 00:00:46,308
Speaker 0: it has i7 you know.

13
00:00:46,388 --> 00:00:51,249
Speaker 0: the only problem with it is that it only has 8 gigs of RAM Which is the mat which is the supposed maximum.

14
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,040
Speaker 0: someone said you could put 16 in there, but I'm not trying that.

15
00:00:55,483 --> 00:00:56,900
Speaker 0: It's not my computer, but anyway.

16
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:58,906
Speaker 0: So yeah because it only is 8 if I like.

17
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:02,376
Speaker 0: have a virtual machine and Spotify and two browsers.

18
00:01:02,457 --> 00:01:03,219
Speaker 0: it starts going slow.

19
00:01:04,162 --> 00:01:05,406
Speaker 0: It's got like two SSDs in it.

20
00:01:05,426 --> 00:01:07,554
Speaker 0: There's nothing wrong with it except today.

21
00:01:07,594 --> 00:01:09,280
Speaker 0: I get to work, and it was off.

22
00:01:09,521 --> 00:01:11,028
Speaker 0: I don't remember turning it off, but it was off.

23
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:12,073
Speaker 1: That's always a bad sign.

24
00:01:12,675 --> 00:01:18,739
Speaker 0: I go to turn it on and You know I start putting my stuff away, and you know whatever and then I go look at it and still off.

25
00:01:21,062 --> 00:01:24,693
Speaker 0: So I push the button again, and this time I watch it right to see why.

26
00:01:25,054 --> 00:01:26,860
Speaker 0: you know make sure it's turning on.

27
00:01:26,981 --> 00:01:35,968
Speaker 1: It's funny in the oldest days when I would boot up a computer like I'm talking 486 like like I would sit there whenever I booted a computer because you didn't leave your computer on like you turned it off Whenever you weren't using it.

28
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,240
Speaker 1: so I would turn it on.

29
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,553
Speaker 1: I would literally always sit there and watch like the entire post process.

30
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,420
Speaker 0: I didn't do that, but anyway.

31
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:50,880
Speaker 0: So I watch it, and it goes think bad push blue button for BIOS And I'm like nope and then it says beep beep beep fan error.

32
00:01:51,342 --> 00:01:53,330
Speaker 0: And then it just turns off fan error.

33
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,636
Speaker 1: that is like in the old cuz.

34
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,640
Speaker 1: they know I used to work at IBM.

35
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:56,893
Speaker 1: That is the like.

36
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:05,060
Speaker 1: yeah This computer is hosed error because it usually means that Something went so wrong in the beginning that like the motherboard can't even really bring everything online.

37
00:02:05,161 --> 00:02:10,794
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it means fan error because I turn it on again And I listen with my ear, and I don't hear no fan.

38
00:02:10,814 --> 00:02:11,939
Speaker 0: I don't hear no fan.

39
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:21,187
Speaker 0: So I go so I email IT using my phone, and I'm like I think my computer broke did and they come over with a can of air.

40
00:02:21,348 --> 00:02:26,265
Speaker 0: we blow out the fan and I push the button and Nope, don't turn on.

41
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:33,975
Speaker 1: well in my experience with servers like you get fan error when the motherboard was hosed Like that's just the error that would bubble up in the end.

42
00:02:33,995 --> 00:02:34,840
Speaker 0: the motherboard is hosed.

43
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,580
Speaker 0: How would it even go to like you know BIOS screen?

44
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:53,134
Speaker 0: You'd be surprised like I mean I suppose if the motherboard was hosed in such a way that the first thing that was broken was that it couldn't provide power to the fan and It detected that fault before proceeding to other fault detection mechanisms and refute it.

45
00:02:53,354 --> 00:03:00,600
Speaker 0: because computer even if I push the blue button to go To BIOS is like no I will not do anything if the fan is not working because because right

46
00:03:01,183 --> 00:03:10,703
Speaker 1: I'm in a situations where I overrode Checks to force like a server like that to boot and it would like that the things that were wrong with it would be way Worse I guess

47
00:03:10,743 --> 00:03:16,020
Speaker 0: if I somehow disabled the fan fault detection, which I don't even know how I would do maybe

48
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:18,065
Speaker 1: server I could trick

49
00:03:18,105 --> 00:03:29,140
Speaker 0: it into thinking the fan is on by providing some power on the fan port or something and Hope that even works, and it's like It could just be the fan is dead too right, but anyway.

50
00:03:30,804 --> 00:03:32,059
Speaker 0: So yeah, they couldn't fix it.

51
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:42,100
Speaker 0: So they gave me this really ugly looking Dell laptop temporarily because I guess that they ordered the surface book But it's not gonna come for a while performance base, or just regular.

52
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:47,900
Speaker 0: I asked for the one that had 16 gigs and a 512 gig SSD because that's what I need to do my work.

53
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,959
Speaker 1: It looks like the most tricked-out one is like 3800 bucks, but I think that's a terabyte SSD.

54
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,126
Speaker 0: Yeah, well I mean that would be nice.

55
00:03:54,327 --> 00:03:55,071
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's crazy.

56
00:03:55,231 --> 00:03:57,523
Speaker 0: I also asked for this has a little dock thing You know.

57
00:03:57,563 --> 00:04:04,295
Speaker 0: so It's a really ugly looking Dell laptop, but you know what the IT guy?

58
00:04:04,597 --> 00:04:05,400
Speaker 0: he done a good job.

59
00:04:05,481 --> 00:04:08,338
Speaker 0: he took my SSD out of my ThinkPad, and he shoved it in this Dell.

60
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:21,022
Speaker 0: and Except for the fact that it's really ugly looking It was like I had my own computer except I had a second SSD in my ThinkPad with like my virtual machines on it Daddy to SS that was.

61
00:04:21,082 --> 00:04:33,358
Speaker 0: it was in the docking station, so I gave it to him and He couldn't really get me in my virtual machine, so I couldn't do a lot of work, so now I gotta bring my SS SATA to USB adapter to work.

62
00:04:34,824 --> 00:04:35,951
Speaker 1: I have one of those somewhere.

63
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:43,543
Speaker 0: I have like two of them, but yeah I got to bring that to work tomorrow, so that I can load my virtual machine, so Semi-related.

64
00:04:43,644 --> 00:04:45,751
Speaker 1: just you know how we like.

65
00:04:45,792 --> 00:04:48,040
Speaker 1: I'm remastering all those old beta episodes of geek nights.

66
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,610
Speaker 1: I'm putting them up on the patreon and listen to one of them.

67
00:04:51,052 --> 00:04:54,974
Speaker 1: last night as I was remastering it And I think it's the last one like.

68
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:55,800
Speaker 1: we actually ordered the mixer.

69
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,266
Speaker 1: But I don't like.

70
00:04:57,286 --> 00:04:59,555
Speaker 1: we're just sort of talking before we do the main thing and all like.

71
00:04:59,615 --> 00:05:00,860
Speaker 1: I can't figure out exactly what happened.

72
00:05:01,282 --> 00:05:10,220
Speaker 1: But this was that era in beacon where we had a lot of computers like all over the house And we just found that hole in the stairway and had run a network cable down to the bottom.

73
00:05:10,842 --> 00:05:12,367
Speaker 1: Here are the two crazy things that happened.

74
00:05:12,527 --> 00:05:12,628
Speaker 1: one.

75
00:05:12,648 --> 00:05:13,912
Speaker 1: We're talking about some network troubles.

76
00:05:13,952 --> 00:05:19,632
Speaker 1: We had we were still using that hub That hub hub we were using.

77
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,622
Speaker 0: this even make hubs anymore Think.

78
00:05:21,682 --> 00:05:23,870
Speaker 1: so we were using a homemade.

79
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,700
Speaker 0: the only reason hubs existed back in the day is because they were cheaper.

80
00:05:27,002 --> 00:05:30,220
Speaker 0: Do you remember what switch required like chips that were expensive?

81
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:37,775
Speaker 1: Yeah, at RIT we bought a switch was slower, and the hub was in some cases And I remember we like dreamed of being able to afford a switch.

82
00:05:38,177 --> 00:05:38,840
Speaker 0: It's like a switch.

83
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,231
Speaker 1: Whoa you can remember what was special about that hub.

84
00:05:42,035 --> 00:05:44,704
Speaker 0: it was it wasn't Full duplex.

85
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:45,709
Speaker 1: that was it and we.

86
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:55,162
Speaker 1: so there was a 10 and a 100 Hub and the 100 hub was like four or five dollars more, and we were like oh shit hundred hundreds better than ten fuck Buy it.

87
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:57,532
Speaker 1: we bought it, and we didn't realize though years later.

88
00:05:57,553 --> 00:06:00,444
Speaker 1: It was half duplex piece of shit Got the job done.

89
00:06:00,725 --> 00:06:06,022
Speaker 1: so apparently we had bought a switch upstairs that was expensive and we put the hub Downstairs.

90
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:16,699
Speaker 1: at the other end of that cable we ran through yeah, and you know who's plugged into that downstairs a computer the duron 900 and You said I forgot that they were even durons.

91
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:23,946
Speaker 1: Yeah, the sentence you said in this of course at the beginning of this episode is downstairs We have a working Gentoo.

92
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:34,453
Speaker 1: You know on the duron Mm-hmm we were running Gentoo on it and apparently we hadn't updated the Gentoo in Months because it took too long to update because it was so slow.

93
00:06:34,473 --> 00:06:36,360
Speaker 0: yeah those duron times.

94
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:41,990
Speaker 0: Basically it was like those are the days where AMD was better than Intel and cheaper And we didn't have bad moneys.

95
00:06:42,071 --> 00:06:43,400
Speaker 1: like a Pentium 4 was a lot of money.

96
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:49,077
Speaker 1: It wasn't that fast and Athlon like Thunderbird was a gigahertz, but they were mad unreliable.

97
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,200
Speaker 0: so I got for myself.

98
00:06:50,381 --> 00:07:00,356
Speaker 0: I bought like AMD k7 whatever and Or Athlons and I got a Real computer for like my parents whatever it was like they don't need performance.

99
00:07:00,476 --> 00:07:01,360
Speaker 0: I'll get this duron.

100
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,532
Speaker 0: It's like the same thing only cheaper because that you know.

101
00:07:03,552 --> 00:07:07,690
Speaker 0: they had Celeron's in those days And now they've simplified it with i3 i5 i7.

102
00:07:07,871 --> 00:07:11,290
Speaker 0: so like a Celeron in those days It was like the low end.

103
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,905
Speaker 0: and then you know Pentium was the real deal.

104
00:07:13,925 --> 00:07:15,229
Speaker 0: the same thing like duron and Athlon.

105
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,333
Speaker 0: duron was the low end.

106
00:07:16,675 --> 00:07:20,093
Speaker 1: and the only other thing is interesting in That is basically they were so unreliable.

107
00:07:20,113 --> 00:07:20,879
Speaker 0: they break all the time.

108
00:07:21,102 --> 00:07:22,397
Speaker 1: Yeah We had all remember we had that like.

109
00:07:23,381 --> 00:07:26,840
Speaker 0: That's why I had so much equipment because I kept having to replace broken shit.

110
00:07:27,343 --> 00:07:30,000
Speaker 0: And I you know if I had just bought an Intel one from the beginning.

111
00:07:30,721 --> 00:07:34,758
Speaker 1: Yep, we had a lot of frankencomputers that era and we kept making all these servers like I was still running.

112
00:07:34,778 --> 00:07:35,180
Speaker 1: that counters.

113
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:45,100
Speaker 0: well because every time you it's like oh this one's sort of broken now, I'll buy a new one and Then you take all the old pieces lying around and put together a working computer and be like up server.

114
00:07:45,526 --> 00:07:50,414
Speaker 1: So we had another server And I don't know what happened because that is cut off of the audio.

115
00:07:50,454 --> 00:07:54,669
Speaker 0: the other things that would happen is like you know This is my second or third computer at this point.

116
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:58,020
Speaker 0: I guess five years right, so I built my first computer 99.

117
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:05,240
Speaker 0: I built my first one in 2000 I built another one at RIT in 2005 and then 2010 and then do right.

118
00:08:06,242 --> 00:08:13,576
Speaker 0: So I had like these old computers But like my original computer for 1999 the most reliable computer to ever exist.

119
00:08:13,837 --> 00:08:23,440
Speaker 0: the only thing that broke about it We X board the BX board the a bit vx6 r2 motherboard for a Pentium 3 slot CPUs with a Pentium 3. that was the most reliable.

120
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,284
Speaker 0: I bet I still have it.

121
00:08:24,485 --> 00:08:26,918
Speaker 0: I bet it still works if I can get enough equipment to make it work.

122
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:29,450
Speaker 1: in fact I was thinking Scott if we could get it to work.

123
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:35,335
Speaker 0: We could use it to generate all new GPG keys Sure, but anyway, I could just use my Apple to GS to do that.

124
00:08:35,817 --> 00:08:39,119
Speaker 0: just be slow But like I probably still works.

125
00:08:39,381 --> 00:08:51,680
Speaker 0: So it even though it was slow to do things like serving up static websites and such or even PHP VB websites It did that job for many moons and didn't need to have any GPUs or anything like that.

126
00:08:52,062 --> 00:09:06,525
Speaker 1: Like I remember we had an a we had an AMD I think video card or an ATI video card that worked But you could not in Linux tell it to output video on the S video port Which is what we needed to plug into

127
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:11,000
Speaker 0: and the cheapo and video card we had would output as video just on boot.

128
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:13,177
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz it wasn't a piece of shit.

129
00:09:14,063 --> 00:09:16,520
Speaker 0: That's why you should not buy a non Nvidia video card.

130
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,142
Speaker 0: They're just better.

131
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:21,156
Speaker 1: that ship sailed and sank a long time ago, but the drama that was happening.

132
00:09:21,216 --> 00:09:24,659
Speaker 1: That's also funny is Apparently like the audio starts.

133
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:31,560
Speaker 1: I'm basically like complaining to you that you broke the DHCP DNS server and you're like, I gotta fix it.

134
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,813
Speaker 1: But and we talked about it at length.

135
00:09:33,853 --> 00:09:34,860
Speaker 1: I don't know what the problem was.

136
00:09:35,181 --> 00:09:42,718
Speaker 1: All I know is you broke the DHCP DNS server that we were using in the house And that was a minor source of drama and then we did an episode about something.

137
00:09:42,738 --> 00:09:43,843
Speaker 0: All right So here's my.

138
00:09:43,863 --> 00:09:44,666
Speaker 0: so check this news.

139
00:09:44,746 --> 00:09:45,509
Speaker 0: I'm checking right?

140
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:53,980
Speaker 0: So this isn't really news is more of a geek bite of OS X The Apple operating system, I'm not talking about the whole thing.

141
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,800
Speaker 0: I'm talking about a piece of it that I discovered at work today.

142
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,500
Speaker 0: So at work, right everyone has everyone on our whole team has an Apple computer except me.

143
00:10:02,981 --> 00:10:07,836
Speaker 0: And everyone has this problem that when they run the website the cert, you know, our dev environment locally.

144
00:10:07,856 --> 00:10:10,244
Speaker 0: It's way slow Except me.

145
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:17,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I've always been like yo, it's cuz you got them Apple sort of half sarcastically But also half it probably is something up with the Apple.

146
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:26,192
Speaker 0: But I know one else knows enough to fix it or figure out what it was Except me and I wasn't doing that because I'd have an Apple computer.

147
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:28,440
Speaker 1: Did you finally look at it and figure it out?

148
00:10:28,964 --> 00:10:29,518
Speaker 0: So I did.

149
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:35,740
Speaker 0: So what happened today is someone comes over right and they're like, they're like, hey, how do they ask me?

150
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:42,020
Speaker 0: You know, they keep giving me the XY question, right where they're like, how do I do this not addressing the real problem?

151
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:47,471
Speaker 0: And he's like, hey, you know When we download the database all the domains don't have.

152
00:10:47,892 --> 00:10:48,915
Speaker 0: they have www.

153
00:10:48,956 --> 00:10:49,979
Speaker 0: how do we get rid of the www?

154
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,569
Speaker 0: And I'm like, why does it matter?

155
00:10:52,609 --> 00:10:52,830
Speaker 0: I'm like.

156
00:10:52,870 --> 00:11:00,120
Speaker 0: just type www is not a problem What he's like, but if I don't do www it's faster and I'm like what?

157
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,427
Speaker 0: What that makes no sense?

158
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,275
Speaker 0: You could use asdf.

159
00:11:04,316 --> 00:11:05,180
Speaker 0: It's just a domain name.

160
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:07,855
Speaker 0: Whatever in your host file is gonna be just fine.

161
00:11:08,197 --> 00:11:10,939
Speaker 0: You could type And it would be just as fast.

162
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:13,366
Speaker 0: Like that makes no sense whatsoever.

163
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:17,299
Speaker 0: that changing the name would change the speed right, right?

164
00:11:18,008 --> 00:11:22,000
Speaker 1: Well, yeah I'm just racking my brain for situations.

165
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:27,820
Speaker 0: So I can imagine I go over there and I try a bunch of stuff and you know to make sure it's not browser caching.

166
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,097
Speaker 0: I'm using private browsing windows and I'm messing with the host file.

167
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:34,012
Speaker 0: and you know Cuz like you're working on this local dev server, right?

168
00:11:34,032 --> 00:11:36,736
Speaker 0: So you don't just want to type localhost You got to type in.

169
00:11:36,777 --> 00:11:46,140
Speaker 0: you know You know Whatever and you want to have that resolve to your load that you know Your local computer so you can load up the website start like in my world.

170
00:11:46,181 --> 00:11:52,000
Speaker 1: It's even more because a lot of things Really won't work if you point them a localhost because they're intended to be like big server.

171
00:11:52,100 --> 00:12:00,960
Speaker 0: I see you go in your host file and you type in a whole bunch of stuff like you add a whole ton of domains For localhost that when you spin up dev servers you can point, you know, you can visit them.

172
00:12:01,081 --> 00:12:07,259
Speaker 1: I've always I don't know if this is lazy or the opposite of lazy I've always run a local DNS server and just connected to that.

173
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,911
Speaker 0: That's not a bad idea because it's just if you want to do that.

174
00:12:09,931 --> 00:12:11,216
Speaker 0: There's a thing called DNS mask masq.

175
00:12:12,342 --> 00:12:14,736
Speaker 0: It's really good for that because you can do wildcards and stuff.

176
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:15,320
Speaker 0: It's really good.

177
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,852
Speaker 0: That's what we used a back and vegan on that.

178
00:12:17,892 --> 00:12:18,937
Speaker 1: So yeah, I look into that.

179
00:12:18,957 --> 00:12:21,939
Speaker 1: cuz I'm really I don't really need to run like a full bind of it.

180
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:28,960
Speaker 0: So it's a much simpler configuration file than bind and it's meant for you know, your local tiny DNS problems.

181
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:35,307
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I mess around with it a whole bunch and it's pretty much slow No matter what I do and I'm like, uh-huh.

182
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:35,829
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

183
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,115
Speaker 0: See name doesn't matter.

184
00:12:37,195 --> 00:12:38,380
Speaker 0: See name doesn't matter, right?

185
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:43,020
Speaker 0: And then eventually they're like no put it back the way it was like originally and it was fast.

186
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,960
Speaker 0: So they mess around with it and it's fast and I go and I look and I see what they did.

187
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:47,342
Speaker 0: You know what?

188
00:12:47,362 --> 00:12:48,306
Speaker 0: They did what they do.

189
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:51,460
Speaker 0: They were visiting the domain of the local computer.

190
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,572
Speaker 0: All right without the WW in front.

191
00:12:53,592 --> 00:12:57,900
Speaker 0: All right, and They had removed that entirely from the host file.

192
00:12:58,261 --> 00:13:00,568
Speaker 0: So I was like, how is this even resolving to localhost?

193
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:09,460
Speaker 0: and it's because the DNS server in the office the local You know network DNS server was resolving the name of their machine to their machine.

194
00:13:09,962 --> 00:13:13,100
Speaker 0: It just wasn't doing it for any subdomains or any other domains.

195
00:13:13,882 --> 00:13:15,748
Speaker 0: But I'm like, wait a minute that makes no sense.

196
00:13:15,888 --> 00:13:17,955
Speaker 1: Why would that be faster?

197
00:13:17,975 --> 00:13:19,700
Speaker 0: that be faster than your host file?

198
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,012
Speaker 0: Shouldn't the host file be the fastest possible thing?

199
00:13:23,032 --> 00:13:29,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, not even making a DNS request I mean on a Linux server in a production environment you pretty much hard code stuff in the host file.

200
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,403
Speaker 1: So you're never.

201
00:13:30,504 --> 00:13:31,629
Speaker 1: you're saving on DNS.

202
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,780
Speaker 0: You're saving milliseconds by doing that, right?

203
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:40,937
Speaker 0: But this was an order of like with with it in the host file It was taking like over 10 to 30 seconds to load the website.

204
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:47,619
Speaker 1: at that point I would type I would type into Google Apple host file slow question mark now that I knew what to search for.

205
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:49,177
Speaker 0: See, I didn't know that.

206
00:13:50,785 --> 00:13:54,581
Speaker 0: Of course, I find indeed that OSX.

207
00:13:54,762 --> 00:13:59,320
Speaker 0: how wait if you're writing an operating system network stack, right and you're writing the DNS part.

208
00:13:59,742 --> 00:14:01,913
Speaker 0: What would the logic be you use?

209
00:14:01,933 --> 00:14:03,440
Speaker 1: All right, so already windows.

210
00:14:04,381 --> 00:14:09,780
Speaker 1: People don't realize that if you'd like in Linux and Linux you type nslookup It will ignore your host file.

211
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:16,326
Speaker 1: That's correct and go to the DNS server because that assumes you're not so stupid that you need to use nslookup To look at your own host file.

212
00:14:16,386 --> 00:14:19,000
Speaker 1: It assumes you want to find out what the real world knows about that.

213
00:14:19,362 --> 00:14:20,369
Speaker 0: Dig does the same thing.

214
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:21,940
Speaker 0: Yes, but that's not the issue, right?

215
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,980
Speaker 1: If you were writing operating system, the rule is you look at the host file and if it's not there then you DNS.

216
00:14:28,221 --> 00:14:38,000
Speaker 1: Maybe you look at both and use whatever comes back first or use the host file If it comes back first, like you could come up with some cleverness, but it's host file then DNS, right?

217
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,579
Speaker 0: So OS X of course is a piece of shit.

218
00:14:40,841 --> 00:14:51,606
Speaker 0: First of all, if you format the host file differently like putting multiple domains on one line That can make it do weird stupid things that make it slow But no one knows it will.

219
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:55,140
Speaker 0: it seems to do DNS first and then fall back on the host file.

220
00:14:55,321 --> 00:15:01,989
Speaker 0: Well, if you don't if you have ipv6 turned on but you don't have an ipv6 entry in the host file That can make it way slow.

221
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:03,959
Speaker 1: Linux machines will have that problem, too.

222
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:15,600
Speaker 0: that's a weird but from from what I could tell is if you have the thing in your host file and It will basically because you're visiting a website, right?

223
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,360
Speaker 0: So you're actually making many many requests for this domain not just one request for the domain.

224
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,014
Speaker 0: You're making a whole bunch right because you're serving the images and these static files.

225
00:15:24,777 --> 00:15:39,980
Speaker 0: It was basically Going through the full DNS timeout on each and every request to the local server and then looking at the host file Basically for every single request to the local server that was in the HTML.

226
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:49,720
Speaker 0: It's like first it made one request waited like three seconds for this timeout Got the HTML and then for each and every image in each and every CSS file in each and every GS file.

227
00:15:50,041 --> 00:16:02,240
Speaker 0: You were getting another three second timeout when it was looking for the DNS of a domain that didn't exist on any DNS server And then looked at the host file afterwards thus making the website load in like 30 seconds.

228
00:16:03,006 --> 00:16:04,579
Speaker 0: And this is because OS X is a piece of shit.

229
00:16:05,542 --> 00:16:06,667
Speaker 0: Is why I don't use that shit.

230
00:16:06,707 --> 00:16:08,959
Speaker 0: I don't know why so many developers use it.

231
00:16:09,682 --> 00:16:15,899
Speaker 0: I've complained about this crap kind of thing for a long time and every time you know It comes off as me just going OS X sucks.

232
00:16:16,444 --> 00:16:18,559
Speaker 0: But then in the end it turns out that I'm right.

233
00:16:18,901 --> 00:16:25,666
Speaker 0: I like when everything else in the universe where I have a feeling about something and I say it and then I turned out to Be vindicated later because I'm always right.

234
00:16:25,847 --> 00:16:28,898
Speaker 0: So what one aside I don't point out times when I was wrong.

235
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:29,500
Speaker 0: They didn't happen.

236
00:16:29,581 --> 00:16:35,689
Speaker 1: I don't know if some of the software that you know I as a job Manage would work on OS X cuz I don't really care.

237
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:46,649
Speaker 1: like so I officially say it doesn't work and we don't support it Rather than ever even attempting to test it for all I know it works fine - I'm googling around so Scott how it on an Apple.

238
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:49,520
Speaker 1: What's the difference between Etsy hosts and private Etsy hosts?

239
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,126
Speaker 0: I never even heard of such a thing.

240
00:16:51,206 --> 00:16:52,171
Speaker 0: Why would there be two hosts?

241
00:16:52,292 --> 00:16:56,234
Speaker 1: Apparently there's a forward slash private And then there's Etsy and a bunch of shit in there.

242
00:16:56,777 --> 00:16:58,364
Speaker 1: All right I'm not sure.

243
00:16:58,384 --> 00:16:59,830
Speaker 1: and I see I'm just.

244
00:17:00,031 --> 00:17:06,292
Speaker 1: I'm googling around for OS X host files And I'm finding websites that just made me even more confused.

245
00:17:06,413 --> 00:17:08,380
Speaker 1: I think it's worse than you're implying, right?

246
00:17:08,901 --> 00:17:19,319
Speaker 0: Basically, it's it's Unix technically the kernel whatever but it is not follow any of the standards or it doesn't follow enough of the Standards for how it works as a Unix.

247
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,720
Speaker 0: This is why it needs like its own like you compile stuff for like one Linux.

248
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,150
Speaker 0: You can run it on another Linux.

249
00:17:25,551 --> 00:17:26,619
Speaker 0: You can file stuff for a Unix.

250
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,627
Speaker 1: You can run slash private.

251
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:30,995
Speaker 1: The first thing just not Google is folder Mac.

252
00:17:31,115 --> 00:17:31,857
Speaker 1: What does?

253
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:33,729
Speaker 0: yeah It's like.

254
00:17:33,749 --> 00:17:35,080
Speaker 0: they just did all this stuff.

255
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:39,540
Speaker 0: That is unlike any other Unix and all these people were like, oh I use it cuz it's like standard Unix.

256
00:17:39,581 --> 00:17:40,359
Speaker 0: It's like you're full of shit.

257
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,728
Speaker 0: It's fucked up and messed up compared to all the other.

258
00:17:42,768 --> 00:17:46,018
Speaker 0: real even Linux which isn't Unix is more Unix than OS X is.

259
00:17:46,801 --> 00:17:49,733
Speaker 0: At this point terms of in terms of practice and not in terms of like.

260
00:17:49,974 --> 00:17:51,340
Speaker 0: don't give me that technical nonsense.

261
00:17:51,441 --> 00:17:53,296
Speaker 0: Like it's approved by the Unix Authority.

262
00:17:53,356 --> 00:17:53,780
Speaker 0: trademark.

263
00:17:54,061 --> 00:17:56,854
Speaker 1: Look if I want to compile something like the other day I had to compile.

264
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:59,800
Speaker 0: as far as the user Experience goes it is fucked the fuck.

265
00:18:00,001 --> 00:18:05,840
Speaker 1: I had to compile pcap on a server the other day because I needed some cap packet capture and I needed like particular.

266
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,963
Speaker 1: There's a whole long story.

267
00:18:06,983 --> 00:18:08,067
Speaker 1: I had to compile pcap.

268
00:18:08,628 --> 00:18:18,320
Speaker 1: So of course, I just install like lib pcap and lib pcap - devel Maybe it's called - lib on your you know distro or whatever and then I type make and all that biz.

269
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:18,821
Speaker 1: You know what?

270
00:18:18,882 --> 00:18:19,483
Speaker 1: It just worked.

271
00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:21,449
Speaker 1: I'm some random Linux distro.

272
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:24,497
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm confident that would not have worked on a Mac.

273
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:28,819
Speaker 0: No, so Yeah, I think what I'm gonna have to do is figure out how to set up.

274
00:18:29,101 --> 00:18:37,271
Speaker 0: I got to get a Mac figure out how to set up DNS mask on it and go around to everyone's computer And get them to use that instead of their host file.

275
00:18:37,472 --> 00:18:39,580
Speaker 0: that might be your best bet and then it should be fast.

276
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,240
Speaker 1: Well one will that work on Mac - will it go to the regular?

277
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,975
Speaker 0: Refers it during the period where I had a Mac.

278
00:18:45,035 --> 00:18:45,640
Speaker 0: That's what I did.

279
00:18:45,962 --> 00:18:48,096
Speaker 0: Oh, which is why I never had this problem.

280
00:18:48,116 --> 00:18:50,610
Speaker 1: when you install it Do you just like point your resolver at.

281
00:18:51,012 --> 00:18:52,680
Speaker 0: yes, you basically got local, right?

282
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,210
Speaker 0: So if you have a resolve.com file you would make this.

283
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:57,640
Speaker 0: you make the first entry be localhost.

284
00:18:57,941 --> 00:19:04,236
Speaker 0: Okay, so that your DNS request go to localhost first and then you put your you know isp's DNS server is the second entry in resolve.com.

285
00:19:04,256 --> 00:19:08,000
Speaker 0: or If you have like a GUI for setting up your DNS like in Windows.

286
00:19:08,121 --> 00:19:10,740
Speaker 0: You just put your localhost as your first DNS server, right?

287
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,177
Speaker 1: You probably want to just put it because you don't want it to round robin.

288
00:19:13,741 --> 00:19:16,660
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is in your DNS mask configuration.

289
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:19,169
Speaker 0: You could tell it to.

290
00:19:19,631 --> 00:19:22,080
Speaker 0: if you don't resolve then hit the right.

291
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,229
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the right way to do it.

292
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:24,498
Speaker 1: You wouldn't want to put your isps one second.

293
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,365
Speaker 1: You want to put DNS mask right?

294
00:19:26,405 --> 00:19:31,040
Speaker 0: You could put the isp's one in the DNS mask conf or on your right?

295
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:31,958
Speaker 0: It's it's up to you.

296
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,900
Speaker 1: I'm gonna set it up because I have my bind is not super well configured cuz I was in a hurry.

297
00:19:36,121 --> 00:19:38,130
Speaker 0: I mean all I do the I'd for these days.

298
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,437
Speaker 0: I just point everything at the Google.

299
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:49,898
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, no I have like three VMS on my local machine at work that are all sort of working with each other because I'm testing a bunch of weird shit and I'm just running bind on one of them.

300
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,300
Speaker 0: Dns mask does the same thing only simpler for situations like that.

301
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,486
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's probably what I'm gonna do.

302
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,820
Speaker 0: You couldn't use it for like a big organization or whatever.

303
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,672
Speaker 0: No, no, no, but you could use it for like.

304
00:19:59,712 --> 00:20:03,169
Speaker 0: I just need some DNS right now I decided I don't want to mess with bind file.

305
00:20:03,229 --> 00:20:05,820
Speaker 1: I will not use any IT service provided by my company.

306
00:20:05,961 --> 00:20:14,567
Speaker 1: I use all my own IT services my own environment Cuz well your own email server, uh Google use Google for that.

307
00:20:14,808 --> 00:20:16,478
Speaker 0: Okay, so you have an exchange server.

308
00:20:16,498 --> 00:20:20,760
Speaker 1: That's oh Bunch of people use outlook from the old days when they had that shit.

309
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,217
Speaker 1: But they're just pointed at Google and they have problems all the time because usually that works.

310
00:20:25,378 --> 00:20:25,820
Speaker 1: It does work.

311
00:20:25,921 --> 00:20:32,940
Speaker 0: It's just their problems are usually They've messed up something in their outlook and there's people I mean, you know, there's people out there who really like outlook.

312
00:20:33,424 --> 00:20:37,006
Speaker 0: You know, I don't understand those people I mean But it's like hey you can at the newest.

313
00:20:37,106 --> 00:20:42,813
Speaker 0: newest outlook is actually better than older outlooks and you can point it like Especially the iPhone iPad apps.

314
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,360
Speaker 0: you can point it at Google.

315
00:20:46,024 --> 00:20:52,521
Speaker 1: In my experience the people who say they prefer outlook tend to also not like newer versions of outlook Mm-hmm.

316
00:20:53,203 --> 00:20:59,680
Speaker 1: So in other news something amazing happened to a mass transit system in San Francisco.

317
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,607
Speaker 1: It's basically they're like have mass transit.

318
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:05,466
Speaker 1: I guess they have trams or I don't know what it is, but they have some sort little choo-choo.

319
00:21:07,242 --> 00:21:11,380
Speaker 1: It has to be like DC's I guess because I'm pretty sure they all use the bus, right?

320
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,738
Speaker 0: That's why people keep talking about throwing rocks at the Google bus.

321
00:21:14,902 --> 00:21:17,099
Speaker 1: Well, those yeah, those buses are private though, right?

322
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,379
Speaker 0: But I'm saying is like if they you know, why is everyone busing if they have a mass transit?

323
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,000
Speaker 1: Well, they mean buses technically are mass transit, but I guess there's other mass transit.

324
00:21:24,321 --> 00:21:37,509
Speaker 1: but anyway, the notable thing is that all the systems that you use to like interact with this or Put your ticket in to get through the turnstile or buy a ticket Got infected with ransomware.

325
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,140
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, this is San Francisco where all the tech people are.

326
00:21:40,241 --> 00:21:42,917
Speaker 0: So that's where you need things to be the most secure, right?

327
00:21:43,098 --> 00:21:47,920
Speaker 0: Yep So it's like, you know, if it's if it's we're in like cyberpunk future, right?

328
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:53,340
Speaker 0: The computers in podunk vale don't actually need to be that secure because no one is from cyber land gives a fuck.

329
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:59,120
Speaker 0: But the cyber land computers of neo Tokyo need to be ultra secure because the cyber hackers everywhere.

330
00:21:59,683 --> 00:22:02,200
Speaker 0: So San Francisco computers need to be the most secure.

331
00:22:03,043 --> 00:22:11,280
Speaker 1: It also apparently got their email systems and possibly internal servers as well And this has been going on for days and days.

332
00:22:11,401 --> 00:22:13,339
Speaker 1: I'm not sure if it's actually back up or not.

333
00:22:13,681 --> 00:22:19,018
Speaker 1: The only solution they had until they fix it which probably involves reinstalling on every device they've got.

334
00:22:19,158 --> 00:22:19,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, just do that.

335
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:24,877
Speaker 1: Yeah, which probably will take a while is they've just opened all the fair gates and everything's free.

336
00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:29,780
Speaker 1: Oh sweet So, I don't know if the hackers who did this hack the metro card.

337
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,035
Speaker 1: We're hoping to get paid or we're hoping for the Robin Hood situation to occur.

338
00:22:34,055 --> 00:22:35,379
Speaker 0: Let's let's hook the metro card.

339
00:22:35,781 --> 00:22:37,107
Speaker 1: I just find this all hilarious.

340
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:43,790
Speaker 1: Like you guys are worried about like voter fraud or recounts or whatever Everything in America is so thinly secured.

341
00:22:44,172 --> 00:22:48,540
Speaker 1: Like you should be worried about like nuclear power plants Here's what we're going to do.

342
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,119
Speaker 0: We're gonna hack all the transit in New York City.

343
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:54,673
Speaker 0: Is that all the transit that is used by rich people like cabs?

344
00:22:55,175 --> 00:22:56,320
Speaker 0: the price goes up and they don't.

345
00:22:57,144 --> 00:22:58,671
Speaker 0: And then all the this.

346
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:06,721
Speaker 1: if you swipe and like a poor neighborhood It's actually free like one in ten is just free and it just it says like it just like winks at you on the thing I got.

347
00:23:06,782 --> 00:23:07,625
Speaker 0: and then and then we like.

348
00:23:07,645 --> 00:23:19,940
Speaker 0: we figure out like who's poor people just based on where they've swiped and we figure out Who's tourists and we charge the tourists like ten bucks a swipe Right and people are like why and you know, they swipe and won't let him in or tourists wife.

349
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,627
Speaker 0: So you just take all their money no matter how much they got.

350
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:22,471
Speaker 0: Yep.

351
00:23:22,772 --> 00:23:23,475
Speaker 0: It's like zero.

352
00:23:23,696 --> 00:23:24,660
Speaker 0: I put a hundred on here.

353
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:28,000
Speaker 1: Well, fuck you, but there's also I mean, it's not just Windows systems.

354
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:35,395
Speaker 1: I've run into many people who apparently work in IT and think they know things who bristle at.

355
00:23:35,557 --> 00:23:40,728
Speaker 1: you know any suggestion of security I might provide to them with a this sort of canned line of.

356
00:23:40,748 --> 00:23:52,367
Speaker 1: you don't need antivirus on Linux and I'm sure I guess they think like I'm in a V or like something you don't need Antivirus anywhere period.

357
00:23:52,568 --> 00:23:55,780
Speaker 0: right that particular security measure is not useful.

358
00:23:56,243 --> 00:24:03,111
Speaker 0: Like intrusion protection systems You still need security systems no matter what you're using.

359
00:24:03,512 --> 00:24:05,296
Speaker 0: real security like a real server.

360
00:24:05,316 --> 00:24:09,448
Speaker 0: Etsy shouldn't change Network network level security.

361
00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:12,722
Speaker 1: Yeah, like there's a whole file systems They should.

362
00:24:12,802 --> 00:24:16,640
Speaker 1: literally nothing in them should ever change without a change ticket.

363
00:24:16,901 --> 00:24:20,735
Speaker 1: So you should at least have a thing that says yo dog opt changed this.

364
00:24:20,775 --> 00:24:24,372
Speaker 1: there's a new file in opt So we're shutting everything down.

365
00:24:24,774 --> 00:24:29,779
Speaker 0: Just keeping you aware You know Did you just detects if anything on any drive changes and if so?

366
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:35,160
Speaker 0: Saves a copy of that for forensic purposes and then wipes it and restores it to its original.

367
00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:45,612
Speaker 1: Yeah the argument I got against that was an unnamed person who said but if you have you watch like the Transaction logs of the database server then like it'll change all the time.

368
00:24:45,632 --> 00:24:46,335
Speaker 1: It'll be worthless.

369
00:24:46,355 --> 00:24:47,298
Speaker 0: You don't look at those.

370
00:24:47,318 --> 00:24:49,506
Speaker 1: Yeah Exceptions dude, you don't?

371
00:24:49,566 --> 00:24:51,292
Speaker 0: you don't look at the whole file system.

372
00:24:51,332 --> 00:24:53,640
Speaker 1: much like how would I tell you how to make a peanut?

373
00:24:53,981 --> 00:24:54,684
Speaker 1: Jelly sandwich?

374
00:24:54,925 --> 00:25:00,546
Speaker 1: I don't specify that you have to put it on a plate nor do I specify that you should use a butter Knife as opposed to a steak knife.

375
00:25:00,747 --> 00:25:03,278
Speaker 1: I sort of assume all those things to get to the higher level.

376
00:25:03,318 --> 00:25:05,520
Speaker 1: instruction I mean if a peanut butter jelly bread?

377
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:05,701
Speaker 1: I

378
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:20,767
Speaker 0: mean if a computer is literally just running an application and the only thing that ever like I think about like a web server The only files that ever change when it's just running our logs or the actual application if we do a release and only then so really and Only the

379
00:25:21,111 --> 00:25:22,742
Speaker 1: last user That

380
00:25:23,042 --> 00:25:31,509
Speaker 0: isn't in var log changes during a non-release period that computer is suspect and should be you know down

381
00:25:33,222 --> 00:25:33,685
Speaker 1: Nobody knows.

382
00:25:33,705 --> 00:25:35,315
Speaker 0: that's an excellent security measure.

383
00:25:35,516 --> 00:25:43,530
Speaker 1: Yeah things of the day.

384
00:25:43,671 --> 00:25:45,909
Speaker 1: The headline on this article says it all.

385
00:25:46,673 --> 00:25:49,630
Speaker 1: This is for on a V Club and it's a very in-depth article.

386
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:52,970
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna I'm not gonna spoil all the juicy and pertinent bits.

387
00:25:53,334 --> 00:25:58,128
Speaker 1: But if you were a fan of double dare I Watch that show quite a bit back in the day was a big fan of double dare.

388
00:25:58,168 --> 00:25:58,953
Speaker 1: as a kid I wasn't like.

389
00:25:59,053 --> 00:26:01,890
Speaker 0: it was one of those shows like I wasn't super excited like watching it.

390
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:04,562
Speaker 1: Like if you turn on the TV and like it was on it was on.

391
00:26:04,722 --> 00:26:06,872
Speaker 0: I was watching it and I'd be in and want To watch it.

392
00:26:06,953 --> 00:26:11,837
Speaker 1: I always wanted to be on it because the prizes to a kid brain We're the best goddamn prizes.

393
00:26:11,857 --> 00:26:13,162
Speaker 0: You know what it was like.

394
00:26:13,463 --> 00:26:14,990
Speaker 0: care kids game gear.

395
00:26:15,312 --> 00:26:17,170
Speaker 1: We'll give you a game gear and send you to Disney.

396
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,675
Speaker 0: You know what you only like.

397
00:26:19,438 --> 00:26:21,245
Speaker 0: I never cared about the prizes and game shows.

398
00:26:21,305 --> 00:26:22,650
Speaker 0: I just wanted to play the game.

399
00:26:22,911 --> 00:26:27,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I want to go and you know, I wanted to slide down the slide into the pile of mud.

400
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:31,870
Speaker 1: So I learned now that I did not want to be in any part of double-dare.

401
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:36,488
Speaker 1: I know because the headline of this article which is very accurate and you really need to read the whole thing because it's long.

402
00:26:36,992 --> 00:26:40,799
Speaker 1: It gets into a lot of detail Like why the prizes were the way they were like.

403
00:26:40,979 --> 00:26:42,705
Speaker 1: everything about the story of this like this is.

404
00:26:43,046 --> 00:26:44,070
Speaker 1: this is great journalism.

405
00:26:44,591 --> 00:26:47,520
Speaker 1: Quote it smelled like death.

406
00:26:47,801 --> 00:26:50,850
Speaker 1: what an oral history of the double dare obstacle course.

407
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,997
Speaker 1: Apparently that shit smelled like dead things.

408
00:26:53,499 --> 00:26:53,740
Speaker 0: Isn't it?

409
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,522
Speaker 0: Just like whipped cream.

410
00:26:54,923 --> 00:26:56,790
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah rotting forever.

411
00:26:57,291 --> 00:27:00,321
Speaker 1: Why'd you clean it into all the surfaces such that they couldn't be clean?

412
00:27:00,361 --> 00:27:04,537
Speaker 1: because none of the people involved in this were experts At any of this.

413
00:27:04,638 --> 00:27:05,643
Speaker 1: they were just winging it.

414
00:27:05,985 --> 00:27:07,050
Speaker 0: Oh, so they didn't clean it properly.

415
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:10,163
Speaker 1: Apparently after the first season they cleaned it like thoroughly.

416
00:27:10,203 --> 00:27:11,970
Speaker 1: at least they thought they did cuz it was just this mat.

417
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:15,266
Speaker 1: They rolled out in the studio this gigantic like rubber mat.

418
00:27:15,326 --> 00:27:15,989
Speaker 0: Just get a new one.

419
00:27:16,632 --> 00:27:21,710
Speaker 1: So they rolled it up after cleaning it and stored it for a year and then they like dried out first to do another season.

420
00:27:22,111 --> 00:27:28,990
Speaker 1: And it didn't smell bad yet, but supposedly anyone who touched it broke out in horrifying blisters.

421
00:27:29,673 --> 00:27:31,401
Speaker 1: Okay, read this thing.

422
00:27:31,482 --> 00:27:33,230
Speaker 1: It is terrifying and fascinating.

423
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:36,347
Speaker 1: How double dare came to be?

424
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:42,078
Speaker 0: Okay I've used this guy's my thing of the day before.

425
00:27:42,499 --> 00:27:49,160
Speaker 0: he's basically finding with all these security weaknesses and stuff and He's got this great one today the poison tap.

426
00:27:49,221 --> 00:27:51,790
Speaker 0: It's actually like a week old or whatever, but you haven't seen it.

427
00:27:52,052 --> 00:27:52,717
Speaker 1: I have not seen it.

428
00:27:53,141 --> 00:27:54,129
Speaker 0: So it's the poison tap.

429
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:58,250
Speaker 0: He's it's basically a tiny Raspberry Pi with an Ethernet cable on it, right?

430
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:07,051
Speaker 0: so you go to a computer and this computer is on but it's locked and You cannot log in because we're gonna assume the password on that lock, you know Cuz?

431
00:28:07,071 --> 00:28:11,028
Speaker 0: they pressed window L or command L and it's legit locked and you cannot unlock it.

432
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:15,527
Speaker 0: But you want to exploit this person and take advantage of them in a way.

433
00:28:15,628 --> 00:28:16,170
Speaker 0: How do you do this?

434
00:28:16,952 --> 00:28:22,610
Speaker 0: You take this Raspberry Pi zero and you plug it into their Ethernet hole, which is not protected in any way whatsoever.

435
00:28:23,372 --> 00:28:34,508
Speaker 1: I have seen cases in high-security environments where the computers themselves were locked in cages and inaccessible Sure, but then we're talking about a laptop on a table and even there you know what I would do if I had to.

436
00:28:34,528 --> 00:28:39,584
Speaker 1: I Would cut the Ethernet cable and then splice my own crossover with an a cable in.

437
00:28:39,925 --> 00:28:46,547
Speaker 0: but I mean like you could go into an Office room for existence or up to a lectern and plug in your Ethernet cable and little do you know.

438
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:49,602
Speaker 0: there is one of these On the other end of the cable hidden inside the table.

439
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:50,667
Speaker 0: Ah, right.

440
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:57,330
Speaker 0: But anyway So we're going to a library this Ethernet cable sticking out of the wall and you plug in and up anyway.

441
00:28:57,972 --> 00:28:58,860
Speaker 0: So here's how it works.

442
00:28:59,345 --> 00:29:04,730
Speaker 0: your computer Even if it's locked when it sees that Ethernet cable is gonna stop using this Wi-Fi and try to use that Ethernet.

443
00:29:04,991 --> 00:29:06,537
Speaker 0: It's gonna do some DHCPs.

444
00:29:06,637 --> 00:29:07,159
Speaker 0: All right.

445
00:29:07,661 --> 00:29:11,275
Speaker 0: So, of course, there's a little DHCP server on there that goes, uh-huh I see that right.

446
00:29:11,336 --> 00:29:12,883
Speaker 0: It's a little fake DNS on there.

447
00:29:12,923 --> 00:29:13,023
Speaker 0: Go.

448
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:13,204
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

449
00:29:13,445 --> 00:29:13,586
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

450
00:29:13,726 --> 00:29:14,028
Speaker 0: We're good.

451
00:29:14,148 --> 00:29:16,455
Speaker 0: Yeah This is not.

452
00:29:16,495 --> 00:29:20,290
Speaker 0: this is actually the Internet and not just a computer pretending to be the Internet.

453
00:29:21,691 --> 00:29:27,009
Speaker 0: And meanwhile because you're a normal person you had your web browser open because that's what you do.

454
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:30,870
Speaker 0: Oh all those pages your web browser your web browser is not closed, right?

455
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:34,070
Speaker 0: It's open behind that lock screen and it's still doing stuff, right?

456
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:42,230
Speaker 0: I mean if you were to unlock your computer and there was a new email in Gmail It would already be there because your browser all the JavaScripts are running in that browser, right?

457
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,339
Speaker 0: So, you know you plug into this.

458
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:48,190
Speaker 0: suddenly your computer thinks that's the internet and doesn't know better.

459
00:29:48,732 --> 00:29:56,541
Speaker 0: So all the things all the requests it was, you know sending or receiving Are going to this little tiny computer instead of to the real internet.

460
00:29:57,383 --> 00:29:59,810
Speaker 0: and if you don't have SSL that's done properly.

461
00:30:00,472 --> 00:30:02,398
Speaker 0: Your browser will believe that.

462
00:30:02,418 --> 00:30:06,210
Speaker 0: yes indeed that thing pretending to be Gmail is Gmail.

463
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:15,650
Speaker 0: Of course, right won't work on Gmail because the SSL is done properly, but For some other website, it will totally believe that and it will send over the cookie for that website.

464
00:30:15,811 --> 00:30:22,698
Speaker 0: and now the person who has that little Raspberry Pi computer can take that cookie and Manually put that cookie into their own browser.

465
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,532
Speaker 0: and now they're logged into that website as you Done.

466
00:30:27,135 --> 00:30:27,960
Speaker 1: This is good stuff.

467
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,085
Speaker 0: Your computer was locked.

468
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:30,050
Speaker 0: Your computer was locked.

469
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:32,263
Speaker 0: You thought it was totally safe, but they plugged in a thing.

470
00:30:32,404 --> 00:30:41,726
Speaker 0: They waited a few seconds They looked at the data and now they're logged into that website as you and the only protection is Make sure all your like turn your computer off all the way.

471
00:30:41,746 --> 00:30:45,923
Speaker 0: Yep Don't leave your browser open even behind the lock screen.

472
00:30:45,963 --> 00:30:47,290
Speaker 0: Don't have an Ethernet hole.

473
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:50,160
Speaker 0: don't let people plug shit into your computer.

474
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:58,610
Speaker 0: don't plug your computer into strange things and Only log into website sites that have real well done SSL because the SSL is done properly.

475
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:03,740
Speaker 0: What will happen is that fake internet will be like, yeah I'm google.com and the web browser goes.

476
00:31:04,202 --> 00:31:13,568
Speaker 0: prove it with this encryption Little Raspberry Pi is like oh no I do not know the secret key of Google because I am NOT a Google server.

477
00:31:13,588 --> 00:31:17,902
Speaker 0: for real I cannot win this encryption battle and it goes you're not real.

478
00:31:17,922 --> 00:31:19,547
Speaker 0: I will not tell you any cookies.

479
00:31:19,567 --> 00:31:24,330
Speaker 1: No Have any like built-in man-of-the-middle attack attempts or any of that nonsense.

480
00:31:25,292 --> 00:31:27,750
Speaker 0: I don't know if you can plug in real internet to the other side of it.

481
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:30,645
Speaker 0: I think it just basically tries to get all your cookies and then whatever.

482
00:31:30,725 --> 00:31:34,642
Speaker 0: but you can watch the video To see all of its advanced features and such.

483
00:31:34,943 --> 00:31:36,570
Speaker 0: that's that's the main feature.

484
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,694
Speaker 0: But it does many other things.

485
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:41,567
Speaker 1: Oh siphons cookies exposes internal router and installs web back door.

486
00:31:41,587 --> 00:31:44,603
Speaker 1: Yep Web back door is good in the moment.

487
00:31:44,623 --> 00:31:48,597
Speaker 1: The book club book is Rebecca Mmm, I'm gonna read it as soon as I finish.

488
00:31:48,637 --> 00:31:49,038
Speaker 1: I'm almost.

489
00:31:49,099 --> 00:31:49,901
Speaker 1: I'm completely.

490
00:31:50,022 --> 00:31:53,257
Speaker 1: I'm like at the end of the mad Adam trilogy I was gonna read.

491
00:31:53,378 --> 00:32:01,648
Speaker 0: I was getting ready to read it again But then I started playing that single-player the new doom game As soon as I got the BFG.

492
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:07,599
Speaker 0: So as soon as I find a cyberdemon to use it on that should be the end of the game And then I've been playing a lot of overwatch and civ6.

493
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:10,069
Speaker 1: So that's been delaying me from more reading as well.

494
00:32:10,633 --> 00:32:12,264
Speaker 1: So we're gonna be at magfest.

495
00:32:12,526 --> 00:32:13,130
Speaker 1: We should.

496
00:32:13,871 --> 00:32:15,379
Speaker 0: Well, I just bought my bus ticket today.

497
00:32:15,439 --> 00:32:17,148
Speaker 1: Yeah, I bought my Amtrak a long time ago.

498
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:22,167
Speaker 1: Scott will be on two panels cuz he's a little baby and I will be on five.

499
00:32:22,187 --> 00:32:24,500
Speaker 0: Oh good I'll have plenty of time to play games.

500
00:32:24,882 --> 00:32:26,070
Speaker 1: So we're gonna be doing quitting.

501
00:32:27,372 --> 00:32:29,039
Speaker 1: And the grind that's me and Scott like.

502
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:31,670
Speaker 1: quitting is a brand new panel and this is the first time anyone can see it.

503
00:32:31,771 --> 00:32:37,767
Speaker 1: It's not on YouTube And we probably won't put this one on YouTube because we're gonna practice it there and put a different version of it.

504
00:32:38,049 --> 00:32:45,970
Speaker 1: when we do It at Pac South where we're very likely doing it as well Pac South will be like the main version and this is like the beta version of quitting.

505
00:32:46,395 --> 00:32:47,750
Speaker 1: We're doing that grind panel again.

506
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:51,309
Speaker 1: I actually updated it because I found some more research and then I'm gonna be on.

507
00:32:51,891 --> 00:32:56,183
Speaker 1: When does Sisyphus rage quit which is a panel discussion as James part.

508
00:32:56,203 --> 00:32:58,670
Speaker 0: now on it are we already doing a quitting panel?

509
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:02,510
Speaker 1: Yes, our quitting panel is us telling you about quitting and this is a bunch of experts.

510
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:10,530
Speaker 0: Young Sisyphus young Scott office, uh, he rage quit after pushing that rock for a long time.

511
00:33:11,772 --> 00:33:13,216
Speaker 1: I look at the rock from a distance.

512
00:33:13,778 --> 00:33:17,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, 2016 Scott office sees that rock far away.

513
00:33:17,612 --> 00:33:22,678
Speaker 0: He sees other people pushing the rock and goes Ramaphis didn't even read a review of the rock.

514
00:33:22,699 --> 00:33:25,630
Speaker 1: remember this looks up the Wikipedia on the word rock and says yeah

515
00:33:26,694 --> 00:33:36,188
Speaker 0: I think the transition between old Scott office and new Scott office is sometime around the World of Warcraft era Where I had been playing muds and then I saw people playing World of Warcraft and I said ain't pushing that one.

516
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:39,315
Speaker 1: Yeah and then I will be on.

517
00:33:39,395 --> 00:33:50,849
Speaker 1: also, uh, the sounds of horror in games in cinema and The virtual mixed and augmented reality panel because I learned a bunch of stuff about AR and VR kind of recently, too Paying attention to it.

518
00:33:51,231 --> 00:33:56,452
Speaker 1: I also think if you made a Five Nights at Freddy's kind of game legit and put it on an oculus and like really made It right.

519
00:33:56,472 --> 00:33:59,830
Speaker 1: I don't I might mess people up like it might be over an ethical line.

520
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:03,679
Speaker 1: I'm not sure yet Kind of want to make it or have someone make it and play.

521
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:07,310
Speaker 0: sure horror games in VR will exist once VR is real.

522
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:13,389
Speaker 1: Well, I saw people having real bad reactions to the like very primitive attempt at something like that.

523
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:16,960
Speaker 1: It was the the you're being beheaded simulator.

524
00:34:17,022 --> 00:34:19,590
Speaker 0: rule 34 isn't just about porn, right?

525
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,956
Speaker 0: If anything I think it's just porn.

526
00:34:20,996 --> 00:34:22,462
Speaker 0: if anything can exist it will exist.

527
00:34:22,542 --> 00:34:22,964
Speaker 0: pretty sure.

528
00:34:23,004 --> 00:34:24,129
Speaker 1: rule 34 is just porn.

529
00:34:24,168 --> 00:34:24,389
Speaker 0: it is.

530
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:26,462
Speaker 0: But I'm saying anything that can exist will exist.

531
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:27,790
Speaker 1: So what is the including porn?

532
00:34:28,752 --> 00:34:31,469
Speaker 0: Rule 34 is a subset of an also true rule.

533
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:32,675
Speaker 0: That is not rule 34.

534
00:34:32,675 --> 00:34:37,340
Speaker 1: moral is that we are going to be at both mag fest and Pac South and it is going to be glorious.

535
00:34:37,664 --> 00:34:48,650
Speaker 1: also Enforcer applications are open for Pac South still but will close soon if you listen to geek nights and you've never enforced the packs And you're already gonna be going back.

536
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:55,090
Speaker 0: That was probably the easiest one to enforce because so chill and because they're slightly short like they could use more enforcers.

537
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:55,914
Speaker 1: I'll put it that way.

538
00:34:55,994 --> 00:34:56,536
Speaker 0: Sorry guys.

539
00:34:56,577 --> 00:34:58,887
Speaker 0: I'm playing some games meaning all the way to San Antonio.

540
00:34:58,907 --> 00:35:03,930
Speaker 1: I'm playing games Yeah, I because we're panelists and gamers and every other packs and we go to like all the paxes.

541
00:35:04,611 --> 00:35:07,388
Speaker 1: I didn't force a paxis, but I don't enforce it all the paxes.

542
00:35:08,235 --> 00:35:13,890
Speaker 1: But if you've never done it I highly recommend you check it out because it's it's way.

543
00:35:14,032 --> 00:35:15,730
Speaker 1: It's a way different view on pax.

544
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:24,512
Speaker 1: Like even if you only do it once like if you think you've staffed like an anime con or something See in the way enforcers do it will make you want to never attend an anime con again Like it is.

545
00:35:24,532 --> 00:35:25,817
Speaker 1: it's off the hook.

546
00:35:26,298 --> 00:35:32,219
Speaker 1: and also if you already bought a badge and you think but rim What if I already bought a badge?

547
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,890
Speaker 1: but I want to enforce don't enforcers get free badges.

548
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:39,250
Speaker 1: They'll probably take care of you and refund the cash you paid for that badge.

549
00:35:40,151 --> 00:35:42,380
Speaker 0: Wouldn't worry about something so trivial, but they'll.

550
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,083
Speaker 0: they got you back.

551
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:46,576
Speaker 0: if you're worrying something about so trivial You're probably not cut out for enforcement.

552
00:35:46,697 --> 00:35:46,978
Speaker 1: Yeah.

553
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:50,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, but pax has got you back and forcing is great.

554
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,437
Speaker 1: I highly recommend if that thing is still open.

555
00:35:52,457 --> 00:35:55,590
Speaker 1: when you listen to this and you're at all intrigued just go check it out.

556
00:35:56,012 --> 00:35:59,270
Speaker 0: I guess the the gamers of Texas just aren't cool enough to enforce.

557
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:06,230
Speaker 1: Otherwise you Scott's YouTube channel does not have his new cooking show yet.

558
00:36:07,072 --> 00:36:13,522
Speaker 0: Listen I was gonna add it some netrunner videos to edit to and You know even with working on it a whole bunch this weekend.

559
00:36:13,884 --> 00:36:15,450
Speaker 0: I could not finish any of them.

560
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,958
Speaker 1: Why don't you pay like the listener to do it.

561
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:22,353
Speaker 1: multiple people have offered for a fee to edit your shit for you as there I haven't seen anyone.

562
00:36:22,393 --> 00:36:37,948
Speaker 0: if you want it if you want me to send you piles upon piles and gigabytes upon gigabytes of raw videos of varying quality and then Arrange them into complete YouTube videos to put on my youtube channel I will pay you an amount of money to do that because it's a pain in the ass.

563
00:36:38,008 --> 00:36:52,149
Speaker 0: and then You know I could pay you actually at minimum $40 a month because if I did not have to edit video I could reduce my Adobe subscription from the $50 a month one that has premiere to the $10 a month one that only has Lightroom and Photoshop.

564
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:59,850
Speaker 1: I Legit if someone wanted me to edit video for them would charge two hundred and thirty dollars an hour.

565
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:01,677
Speaker 0: I'm not saying $40 is enough.

566
00:37:01,737 --> 00:37:04,750
Speaker 0: I'm saying that is the minimum amount of money that I have available minimum.

567
00:37:04,991 --> 00:37:09,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess it was just premiere like and not like super crazy shit.

568
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:14,145
Speaker 1: I'd probably only charge like on 150 an hour because 230 is like.

569
00:37:14,286 --> 00:37:19,766
Speaker 0: but the other problem on Professional services rate the other problem is like there's only certain the stuff that I have to do like.

570
00:37:19,826 --> 00:37:24,869
Speaker 0: I do a lot of dubbing Over and I can't have another person dub over because they don't know what I'm gonna say.

571
00:37:26,292 --> 00:37:31,250
Speaker 1: Well you so you don't just want an editor you actually want a producer who's gonna be like Scott.

572
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,369
Speaker 1: I need you to say all this shit right now?

573
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:36,890
Speaker 0: Well, no because like I got to watch this thing like to make a netrunner video, right?

574
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:38,216
Speaker 0: So I got a video of a netrunner game.

575
00:37:38,236 --> 00:37:39,160
Speaker 0: It's 20 minutes long.

576
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,506
Speaker 0: Yeah, I gotta watch it.

577
00:37:40,587 --> 00:37:41,149
Speaker 0: That takes 20 minutes.

578
00:37:41,431 --> 00:37:43,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, then I got to watch it while talking.

579
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:44,818
Speaker 1: So why you gotta watch it the first time?

580
00:37:44,999 --> 00:37:52,830
Speaker 0: just watch and go because I need to know What's gonna happen in the game in advance to so I don't miss out and talking about the good shit.

581
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:55,490
Speaker 1: So the way I do stuff like you can do a way better.

582
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:58,470
Speaker 0: Commentary on a sporting event if you've seen the sporting event already.

583
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:09,630
Speaker 1: so the way I do stuff like that because I do this with pretty much anything where I'm reading either reading from a script or I'm doing some sort of like ad hoc commentary on a thing that I might be watching is the first time I watch it.

584
00:38:10,051 --> 00:38:16,770
Speaker 1: I do commentary anyway while I'm watching but I throw that away and then I do it again and do the commentary even still.

585
00:38:16,972 --> 00:38:21,881
Speaker 0: So it's already a minimum of 40 minutes Not counting the editing time and all the other part.

586
00:38:21,901 --> 00:38:25,028
Speaker 0: so it's like be a lot faster if you had a knob if the knob doesn't matter.

587
00:38:26,831 --> 00:38:32,910
Speaker 0: So just like all of this is it take to make a 20-minute video takes me multiple hours and it's like on a weekend.

588
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:33,939
Speaker 0: That's really what I want to do.

589
00:38:33,959 --> 00:38:37,601
Speaker 1: Oh How do you think all these YouTube videos of geek nights are?

590
00:38:37,621 --> 00:38:39,590
Speaker 0: and the other problem is I shoot lots of video?

591
00:38:40,211 --> 00:38:47,830
Speaker 0: And then even when I'm done like I'm not satisfied when I look at the video like the cooking one I'm like, uh, I maybe I'll change the way it's shot.

592
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:52,784
Speaker 1: You know, I thought your philosophy was fuck it just start spraying your internet all over.

593
00:38:52,804 --> 00:38:55,534
Speaker 0: that is that's the philosophy that I wrote down on Paper, but I can't.

594
00:38:55,614 --> 00:38:57,322
Speaker 0: actually it's hard to bring myself to do that.

595
00:38:57,342 --> 00:39:06,790
Speaker 1: I have forced myself to do it Scott You saw that five minutes ago But you keep uploading a bunch of crap was really popular though And the people like crap that but you also like crap.

596
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:14,670
Speaker 1: But in terms of like the video of when you see my face just sitting there talking like yeah I can see exactly how I lit that scene the wrong way.

597
00:39:15,051 --> 00:39:21,250
Speaker 1: But I said fuck it and just uploaded it instead of like waiting a month and then re-recording it.

598
00:39:23,578 --> 00:39:24,588
Speaker 0: And then you upload piece of shit.

599
00:39:25,393 --> 00:39:27,302
Speaker 1: I think it's better than you know.

600
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,810
Speaker 0: runner videos my non-existent.

601
00:39:33,773 --> 00:39:34,978
Speaker 1: So anyway, it's computer buying.

602
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:38,333
Speaker 0: you had to have a hand with poop in it or an empty hand Depends.

603
00:39:38,373 --> 00:39:41,929
Speaker 1: poop might be worth a non-zero amount of money depending on where what the context is.

604
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,937
Speaker 0: At least my hand don't stink.

605
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,563
Speaker 1: I think your hand stinks.

606
00:39:45,844 --> 00:39:47,270
Speaker 1: no, it's just it's inside of a box.

607
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:48,434
Speaker 1: You haven't let it out into the world.

608
00:39:49,478 --> 00:39:51,826
Speaker 1: No, so I almost bought a computer.

609
00:39:51,846 --> 00:39:53,010
Speaker 1: like I was sitting at work today.

610
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:53,553
Speaker 1: I was like, you know what?

611
00:39:53,613 --> 00:39:53,895
Speaker 1: Fuck it.

612
00:39:53,955 --> 00:40:01,330
Speaker 1: I almost just did the thing where you take a new egg Wishlist and say add to cart and then you say bye in the car.

613
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:10,370
Speaker 0: Well, first of all nowadays, you can't be doing that because Amazon Especially when you're like me with the Amazon Prime and Amazon credit card Some things are cheaper and they are on Amazon.

614
00:40:10,471 --> 00:40:17,543
Speaker 0: So you have to go through that cart and say and look up each item on Amazon You're gonna buy from Amazon and which ones you get for new egg.

615
00:40:17,684 --> 00:40:24,672
Speaker 0: Here's the way I do that I put which is actually like I'm Upset that I have to do this because back in the day you could just trust that new egg was gonna be the best and Just do that.

616
00:40:24,933 --> 00:40:32,520
Speaker 1: Well, I'm gonna have to do it now because as I keep refreshing this thing Things keep coming in and out of stock right now the CPU and motherboard.

617
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,303
Speaker 0: I want her out of stock.

618
00:40:33,624 --> 00:40:34,767
Speaker 0: Oh not on Amazon.

619
00:40:35,791 --> 00:40:37,380
Speaker 1: Maybe not the trouble with Amazon.

620
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,290
Speaker 1: You got to make sure who you're actually buying it from.

621
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:39,932
Speaker 0: You got to do that.

622
00:40:39,952 --> 00:40:42,382
Speaker 0: a new egg - yeah new egg has the same issue.

623
00:40:42,643 --> 00:40:50,350
Speaker 1: Yep, where there's third-party sellers on there Yep, I worry that Amazon's third parties are on the whole less reliable and less safe.

624
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:58,881
Speaker 0: Well, the ones that are Amazon's third-party sellers if they are fulfilled by Amazon are actually mostly safe Except you get a lot of counterfeit shit through there and that's what the problem.

625
00:40:58,901 --> 00:41:02,379
Speaker 0: if I'm buying computer stuff though for a computer That's gonna last me five years.

626
00:41:02,419 --> 00:41:04,009
Speaker 0: That is the most important thing that I own.

627
00:41:04,472 --> 00:41:07,970
Speaker 0: I am making sure that I get everything legit brand new perfect.

628
00:41:08,051 --> 00:41:08,393
Speaker 0: But what

629
00:41:08,434 --> 00:41:21,069
Speaker 1: I do is I add the whole cart in the new egg like from the fluish list and then I go through each item and I look on Amazon and a couple other places and then I Slowly if I if I find it better on Amazon I delete it from the new egg cart add it to the other card.

630
00:41:21,331 --> 00:41:24,849
Speaker 1: So when I'm at the bottom of the list, everything is in one of three shopping carts.

631
00:41:25,251 --> 00:41:33,754
Speaker 0: So anyway, I was doing the same thing because my computer well, it's definitely got another year or more in it in terms of power In performance.

632
00:41:33,975 --> 00:41:37,190
Speaker 0: It's been having some hardware blue screen crash type problems.

633
00:41:37,471 --> 00:41:39,719
Speaker 1: And I read why did you break your computer?

634
00:41:39,739 --> 00:41:40,663
Speaker 1: So you have to buy a new one.

635
00:41:40,683 --> 00:41:42,550
Speaker 0: Why did my computer works fine?

636
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:44,293
Speaker 1: Your computer works fine.

637
00:41:44,353 --> 00:41:46,459
Speaker 0: I reset way to reset windows.

638
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:48,384
Speaker 0: your computer has some issues.

639
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:51,440
Speaker 1: My computer's blue screening Some I got.

640
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,449
Speaker 1: my computer works fine.

641
00:41:53,112 --> 00:41:53,654
Speaker 1: Which one?

642
00:41:53,734 --> 00:41:56,484
Speaker 0: it blue screens occasionally, but it's like it's all good.

643
00:41:56,525 --> 00:41:57,026
Speaker 1: It's still good.

644
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:57,950
Speaker 1: It's just a little bit blue.

645
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:05,779
Speaker 0: It's on this borderline where it's like the blue screen isn't so frequent that you can't use the computer But it's not so rare that it will never fuck you.

646
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:12,541
Speaker 1: your computer is blue screening at about the rate that the remember the computer The tall giant case I built like a long time ago.

647
00:42:12,561 --> 00:42:15,050
Speaker 1: Yeah that we did geek nights on with a resound forever.

648
00:42:15,677 --> 00:42:19,075
Speaker 1: That thing would blue screen About once a month.

649
00:42:19,417 --> 00:42:20,481
Speaker 0: This is a little more than that.

650
00:42:20,883 --> 00:42:29,290
Speaker 1: So when it blue screen once a month Anytime you saw it blue screen you gave me easily 10 minutes of shit about how my computer is shit and I'm shit.

651
00:42:29,431 --> 00:42:37,892
Speaker 0: I think I think the motherboard just messed up because it also If you if you bump it like you'll hear the USB like a doo doo doo doo doo doo Even though you didn't.

652
00:42:37,953 --> 00:42:40,826
Speaker 1: I'm telling you USB headers are like the no cuz.

653
00:42:40,846 --> 00:42:41,650
Speaker 1: so it worked today, right?

654
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:43,997
Speaker 1: Cuz I was telling you this and some other.

655
00:42:44,017 --> 00:42:54,676
Speaker 1: multiple people have been talking about their computers having issues and a lot of them have fixed it or at least made it better by unplugging USB headers to their old case or Disabling all the USB ports.

656
00:42:54,696 --> 00:42:57,406
Speaker 0: They're not using but anyway, so I was thinking well and it work.

657
00:42:57,667 --> 00:42:58,610
Speaker 1: a dude literally.

658
00:42:58,710 --> 00:42:59,574
Speaker 1: I watched him.

659
00:42:59,916 --> 00:43:06,270
Speaker 1: he went over and got a new USB cable cuz like his was broken or something And he plugged it into his computer and then the computer just rebooted.

660
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:08,458
Speaker 1: He was like what and I looked over at him.

661
00:43:08,498 --> 00:43:11,670
Speaker 1: I was like you should disable that USB thing on your case.

662
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:12,594
Speaker 1: It's probably dead.

663
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:20,082
Speaker 0: So anyway, I was I was gonna just replace the motherboard now Even though my CPU is great.

664
00:43:20,143 --> 00:43:20,344
Speaker 0: It's an i7.

665
00:43:20,465 --> 00:43:20,787
Speaker 0: It's great.

666
00:43:21,651 --> 00:43:25,390
Speaker 0: My video card is a 680 which is not as good as newer video cards.

667
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:28,421
Speaker 1: Well, which I seven you have because you're that's Broadwell at best.

668
00:43:28,502 --> 00:43:30,690
Speaker 0: probably I think it is as well.

669
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:31,694
Speaker 0: I think it's had something.

670
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:34,105
Speaker 0: it has something well, but it was like it was great.

671
00:43:34,286 --> 00:43:39,350
Speaker 0: I think it has well It's 75% as good as the newest i7 of Lake or whatever.

672
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:43,784
Speaker 1: Cuz again, my my i7 is so much older than yours.

673
00:43:43,864 --> 00:43:45,309
Speaker 0: mines three and a half gigahertz.

674
00:43:45,349 --> 00:43:45,710
Speaker 0: It's fine.

675
00:43:45,871 --> 00:43:52,884
Speaker 0: Anyway, mine's two point six six eighty is not a 1080 It's not a 980 but it's a 680 and it gets a job done.

676
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:53,346
Speaker 0: It's great.

677
00:43:53,366 --> 00:43:54,129
Speaker 0: There's nothing wrong with it.

678
00:43:55,473 --> 00:43:57,190
Speaker 0: So it's like I really just wanna play some motherboard.

679
00:43:57,330 --> 00:44:03,750
Speaker 0: I cannot find a suitable replacement motherboard that is like trustworthy because it's a weird old socket from those days.

680
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:08,324
Speaker 1: so I used to have this philosophy the old days of I'd buy a computer with the eye of.

681
00:44:08,344 --> 00:44:12,989
Speaker 1: I will upgrade many Components of it as it ages and that's still true.

682
00:44:13,471 --> 00:44:21,303
Speaker 1: But there was a time when I expected to be able to do that with CPUs and I kind of expected that I wanted a socket Like I'd get the new socket or the new slot.

683
00:44:21,324 --> 00:44:22,370
Speaker 1: remember when slobs were a thing?

684
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:26,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, right when it was new so I'd have the longest lifespan of that slot or socket.

685
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:29,199
Speaker 1: But now sockets don't last that long.

686
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:32,170
Speaker 0: every single CPU architecture has a new socket that goes with it.

687
00:44:32,492 --> 00:44:35,469
Speaker 0: So you buy the fastest CPU that goes in that socket and then that's it.

688
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:40,033
Speaker 0: If when you want a new CPU get a new motherboard and you know what it didn't even work back then Cuz I got an.

689
00:44:40,234 --> 00:44:51,928
Speaker 1: I got an Athlon k7 800 Least other things don't change 800 up to 933 and it worked great.

690
00:44:52,652 --> 00:44:56,323
Speaker 1: But then it died and the motherboard died.

691
00:44:56,624 --> 00:45:04,950
Speaker 1: like well the CPU was fine the motherboard died But then Thunderbird like the gigahertz came out and it went back to slots a socket instead of slot.

692
00:45:05,272 --> 00:45:07,144
Speaker 1: So I was just fucked like you can.

693
00:45:07,164 --> 00:45:07,809
Speaker 1: now you just got it.

694
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:12,950
Speaker 1: You can't worry about buying a new motherboard and replacing it with the after like six months.

695
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:15,622
Speaker 0: Let's talk about building a PC today.

696
00:45:15,642 --> 00:45:17,410
Speaker 0: What's available on the market right now?

697
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:18,976
Speaker 0: It's sort of a weird time right.

698
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:22,450
Speaker 0: on the one hand things are on sale cuz it's Black Friday holiday season.

699
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:23,313
Speaker 0: This is a good time.

700
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:24,498
Speaker 0: Cyber Monday is today.

701
00:45:24,518 --> 00:45:31,166
Speaker 0: Yeah, but in terms of the big picture It's sort of a weird time because the kid would the.

702
00:45:31,407 --> 00:45:38,150
Speaker 1: the Intel i7 6700 K quad-core Skylake has been the CPU to buy for over a year.

703
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:43,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like 16 months old and it's been the number one home desktop CPU you can get there isn't?

704
00:45:45,171 --> 00:45:46,355
Speaker 1: There isn't a better one.

705
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:50,590
Speaker 0: there are faster better ones, but not for a normal person with a normal computer.

706
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:54,200
Speaker 0: There's only ridiculous nonsense extreme bullshit.

707
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:56,867
Speaker 1: If you search for desktop CPUs, there isn't one better.

708
00:45:57,208 --> 00:46:04,590
Speaker 1: the best you could do That's maybe better is getting one that has more cores, but the clocks actually way slower if you do that.

709
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:07,149
Speaker 0: Yeah, well now there's like some Zia nonsense you could buy.

710
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:16,190
Speaker 0: But anyway, so yeah The same CPU has been the number one CPU for like 16 months and so early next year is gonna be the net.

711
00:46:16,554 --> 00:46:17,748
Speaker 0: This is Skylake right now.

712
00:46:17,912 --> 00:46:20,598
Speaker 1: Yeah So this is gonna be Kaby late, which is a tick.

713
00:46:20,899 --> 00:46:22,986
Speaker 0: Kaby Lake is gonna come out early next year.

714
00:46:23,026 --> 00:46:24,130
Speaker 0: supposedly, right?

715
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:24,908
Speaker 0: It's been delayed.

716
00:46:25,712 --> 00:46:30,143
Speaker 0: From everything that people have said it is going to be effectively an insignia.

717
00:46:30,183 --> 00:46:32,890
Speaker 1: Maybe Lake is beyond tick and talk there.

718
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:33,898
Speaker 1: It's not tick tock anymore.

719
00:46:33,938 --> 00:46:35,450
Speaker 0: It's just weird, but it doesn't matter.

720
00:46:35,932 --> 00:46:38,425
Speaker 0: It is going to basically be insignificant.

721
00:46:38,526 --> 00:46:40,536
Speaker 0: all reports are Insignificantly better.

722
00:46:40,616 --> 00:46:43,370
Speaker 0: there won't be a reason to get a Kaby Lake versus.

723
00:46:44,331 --> 00:46:49,850
Speaker 0: The only thing I've heard about like Kaby Lake is like oh if you have Netflix you can watch 4k if you have that.

724
00:46:49,931 --> 00:46:50,489
Speaker 0: But well, that's it.

725
00:46:51,272 --> 00:47:01,183
Speaker 1: The only thing I can see a Kaby Lake that actually might matter at all is that it might actually be faster in the gigahertz Because maybe kind of maxed out at four, but it's the same.

726
00:47:01,203 --> 00:47:03,269
Speaker 0: that is the same nanometers and everything, right?

727
00:47:03,591 --> 00:47:05,568
Speaker 1: But you know, but it has a better fab process.

728
00:47:05,629 --> 00:47:11,585
Speaker 1: that Process and chip yields matters way more than you realize it uses.

729
00:47:11,625 --> 00:47:13,190
Speaker 1: less power is a big part of it.

730
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:14,757
Speaker 0: It's not worth like waiting for this thing.

731
00:47:14,797 --> 00:47:15,922
Speaker 0: No, no, it's not gonna be.

732
00:47:15,942 --> 00:47:17,790
Speaker 0: you're not gonna get better more performance out of it.

733
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:19,018
Speaker 1: Here's where I might wait for it.

734
00:47:19,159 --> 00:47:21,952
Speaker 1: If you were building a tiny HTPC.

735
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:22,895
Speaker 0: Yeah, that might matter.

736
00:47:22,976 --> 00:47:23,718
Speaker 1: It's worth it to wait.

737
00:47:23,738 --> 00:47:24,983
Speaker 0: Especially one without a video card.

738
00:47:25,003 --> 00:47:29,946
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz this shit is Real good if you don't have a video card.

739
00:47:29,966 --> 00:47:30,086
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

740
00:47:31,531 --> 00:47:36,629
Speaker 0: But yeah, otherwise there don't say right after that is gonna be some other leak like at the end of next.

741
00:47:36,649 --> 00:47:37,914
Speaker 1: coffee Lake is the next.

742
00:47:37,934 --> 00:47:39,160
Speaker 0: no that one that's a weird one.

743
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,084
Speaker 0: That's not a normal one.

744
00:47:40,245 --> 00:47:42,394
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that is the oh I didn't.

745
00:47:42,455 --> 00:47:52,230
Speaker 1: so I didn't look past Sky Lake cuz you know It's Kaby Lake is literally like as far as I could possibly think cuz my current computer literally cannot make it past Kaby Lake.

746
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:53,753
Speaker 1: But yeah, you're right.

747
00:47:53,793 --> 00:47:56,501
Speaker 1: Coffee Lake is just yet more process optimization.

748
00:47:56,521 --> 00:47:58,828
Speaker 0: No, but it's it's not enough for desktop CPUs.

749
00:47:58,908 --> 00:47:59,370
Speaker 0: It's a weird.

750
00:48:00,513 --> 00:48:05,790
Speaker 1: And Lake is the next one that is 10 nanometer and too far out to even think about right.

751
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:13,865
Speaker 0: So the 10 that's at the end of next year is gonna be or the early 2018 is like the next time there'll be a 10 nanometer process.

752
00:48:13,885 --> 00:48:17,214
Speaker 0: So that will be a Significantly better CPU.

753
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:18,377
Speaker 1: also it will not.

754
00:48:18,457 --> 00:48:19,941
Speaker 1: so there's been some updates there.

755
00:48:20,322 --> 00:48:22,086
Speaker 1: Apparently there have been yield problems.

756
00:48:22,367 --> 00:48:22,888
Speaker 1: Sure it.

757
00:48:23,429 --> 00:48:28,305
Speaker 1: so When it comes out, they're only gonna have the low power versions as far as I can.

758
00:48:28,466 --> 00:48:42,766
Speaker 0: Anyway, but the point is Your choice is to buy a CPU that's like over a year old which feels bad and isn't cheaper now than it was then or wait Over a year to get one that's significantly better.

759
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:43,730
Speaker 0: So it's like damn it.

760
00:48:44,191 --> 00:48:50,550
Speaker 0: I don't want to buy this thing that feels old and obsolete but it's not gonna be old and obsolete for a whole nother year.

761
00:48:50,872 --> 00:48:53,310
Speaker 0: But I usually buy computers every five years.

762
00:48:54,013 --> 00:49:08,193
Speaker 0: Wait that if I can hold out and wait that year and get that 10 nanometer chip at the end of next 2017 early 2018 you know is gonna last five years for sure the but in the modern era thinking like that Like this is the longest plateau ever.

763
00:49:08,213 --> 00:49:14,215
Speaker 1: I think in modern computer history le CPU wise and The what makes me full.

764
00:49:14,476 --> 00:49:26,543
Speaker 1: if you just if you try to wait if you always if you go to Wikipedia and look at like Each architecture so cannon lake will come out and you're like, yeah, and I'm gonna get cannon leg But then you're gonna see Successor and you'll see what's coming out in just eight

765
00:49:26,564 --> 00:49:27,086
Speaker 0: more months.

766
00:49:27,186 --> 00:49:28,070
Speaker 0: No, that will be out.

767
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:33,490
Speaker 0: No, that is they're going so slow now, whatever comes after that is gonna be like years after that.

768
00:49:33,871 --> 00:49:45,142
Speaker 1: I am dubious of the idea that cannon lake will be available in a high-performance high-power Consumption capability on desktops before the like third quarter.

769
00:49:45,323 --> 00:49:49,536
Speaker 0: What's upsetting is that this i7 you can buy now the 6700 it's not cheaper.

770
00:49:49,717 --> 00:49:51,726
Speaker 0: It's only 25% better than the i7.

771
00:49:51,766 --> 00:49:54,956
Speaker 0: I've already got yes It's not even that much faster i7.

772
00:49:55,358 --> 00:49:57,183
Speaker 1: My i7 is even older than it's.

773
00:49:57,223 --> 00:49:58,206
Speaker 0: even older than mine is 2.6 gigahertz.

774
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:00,555
Speaker 0: Yeah, mine's three and a half.

775
00:50:00,656 --> 00:50:03,250
Speaker 1: Anyway, it'll get up to three if I overclock it, right?

776
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:04,714
Speaker 0: So that's the CP.

777
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:09,350
Speaker 0: the state of CPUs is kind of sad and upsetting but the state of GPUs is the exact opposite.

778
00:50:09,572 --> 00:50:10,542
Speaker 0: The 1080. the 1080 is the king.

779
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:17,028
Speaker 0: It's so much faster than every other video card that has come before.

780
00:50:17,048 --> 00:50:17,830
Speaker 0: it is ridiculous.

781
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:18,955
Speaker 0: It's even lower power.

782
00:50:19,317 --> 00:50:20,000
Speaker 0: It's just sick.

783
00:50:20,161 --> 00:50:20,925
Speaker 0: It's insane.

784
00:50:21,186 --> 00:50:22,030
Speaker 0: It just came out.

785
00:50:22,331 --> 00:50:24,177
Speaker 0: It's like you cannot go wrong buying a 1080 or 1070 today.

786
00:50:24,297 --> 00:50:25,461
Speaker 0: It is just like boom here.

787
00:50:25,943 --> 00:50:26,103
Speaker 0: it is.

788
00:50:28,251 --> 00:50:33,849
Speaker 0: It's super new relatively speaking and it's super powerful and it's expensive but with a good reason.

789
00:50:33,869 --> 00:50:37,867
Speaker 0: now I am not going to 1080. that shit is gonna last you like six years.

790
00:50:37,927 --> 00:50:38,490
Speaker 0: It's so strong.

791
00:50:38,731 --> 00:50:44,349
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna buy a 1080 right away because the only reason video cards not my bottleneck right now.

792
00:50:45,152 --> 00:50:45,895
Speaker 1: I got a 770.

793
00:50:45,895 --> 00:50:47,139
Speaker 1: It's doing okay.

794
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:49,247
Speaker 0: My 680 does just fine, right but it's like man.

795
00:50:49,367 --> 00:50:50,471
Speaker 0: how that 1080.

796
00:50:50,471 --> 00:50:50,752
Speaker 0: It's like.

797
00:50:50,772 --> 00:50:53,302
Speaker 0: it's just so fucking but it's in my near-term horizon.

798
00:50:53,322 --> 00:50:53,704
Speaker 0: I got a 1070.

799
00:50:53,704 --> 00:50:54,166
Speaker 0: I'm a HTPC.

800
00:50:55,331 --> 00:50:58,061
Speaker 0: It's just insane and I'm like damn if that's a 1070.

801
00:50:58,061 --> 00:50:58,643
Speaker 0: What is the 1080 right?

802
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:02,879
Speaker 0: It must be like the video card of God.

803
00:51:03,321 --> 00:51:05,210
Speaker 1: so we're at an interesting point in hard drives.

804
00:51:05,591 --> 00:51:18,376
Speaker 1: so, you know if I feel bad because if I built this computer a year ago, I Basically could have paid mostly the same for the chip and like motherboard and RAM that I would get today That feels real bad.

805
00:51:18,417 --> 00:51:22,130
Speaker 1: That means I could have paid the same and had a years of this computer already.

806
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:26,004
Speaker 1: Yeah, but hard drives have come a long way.

807
00:51:26,024 --> 00:51:38,722
Speaker 1: They have m2 is a big deal Yeah, and way back like I found some old specs when I was speccing out PCs and I specced out this 256 gigabyte like m2 SATA drive that was just kind of bullshit, right?

808
00:51:38,742 --> 00:51:40,450
Speaker 0: So so for you don't know, right?

809
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:43,142
Speaker 0: So we had regular old ID that's dead.

810
00:51:43,322 --> 00:51:44,970
Speaker 0: s ATA is now every drive, right?

811
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:45,852
Speaker 0: Even is it a six?

812
00:51:45,912 --> 00:51:48,700
Speaker 0: say the three dead right 60 gigabits per second.

813
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,866
Speaker 1: There's a to express and whatever.

814
00:51:51,046 --> 00:51:54,342
Speaker 0: people are buying SSDs So we're not even worried about spinning magnets anymore.

815
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:55,570
Speaker 0: So that's what I have in my computer.

816
00:51:55,671 --> 00:52:05,726
Speaker 0: I have SSDs with sata 6 gigabits per second and I didn't think about even going faster than that because like Disc speed hasn't been an issue because that's what I have right.

817
00:52:06,008 --> 00:52:10,340
Speaker 0: but no M2 is basically this longish kind of rectangular.

818
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,484
Speaker 1: It looks like a RAM stick.

819
00:52:11,504 --> 00:52:13,490
Speaker 1: basically plug it into the side, right?

820
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:20,693
Speaker 0: It's basically an SSD that's exposed and there's a one spot on the motherboard for it to go in and it some mother who if you get a fancy

821
00:52:20,713 --> 00:52:21,195
Speaker 1: mother some

822
00:52:21,235 --> 00:52:32,974
Speaker 0: motherboards it even goes underneath like especially if it's a micro ATX and it's like you know, it basically takes up no room doesn't have any cables doesn't need anything for the power supply and it's a Storage device.

823
00:52:33,014 --> 00:52:34,622
Speaker 0: It's a SSD storage device here.

824
00:52:34,843 --> 00:52:36,210
Speaker 1: Here's the two things that make this good.

825
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:39,264
Speaker 1: So now and there was some earlier confusion.

826
00:52:39,324 --> 00:52:40,047
Speaker 0: It's like that's just.

827
00:52:40,128 --> 00:52:40,630
Speaker 0: that's nice.

828
00:52:40,811 --> 00:52:43,264
Speaker 0: But why is it so much more money than an S that?

829
00:52:43,304 --> 00:52:44,430
Speaker 0: is that a standalone?

830
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:45,975
Speaker 0: Sata SSD.

831
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,965
Speaker 1: so if you get a crappy one, it's not better.

832
00:52:48,106 --> 00:52:48,830
Speaker 1: It's just nicer.

833
00:52:49,052 --> 00:52:52,198
Speaker 0: It's just nice that it's you know So much smaller and takes up less room.

834
00:52:52,218 --> 00:52:54,850
Speaker 0: really good if you want to make a tiny PC and not have cables and stuff.

835
00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:56,074
Speaker 1: So first let's back up a little bit.

836
00:52:56,354 --> 00:53:01,430
Speaker 1: It used to be any SSD is better no matter what even if it's low-end.

837
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:07,790
Speaker 1: Nowadays low-end SSDs are pretty shit and like you look at benchmarks pay more for the better SSD.

838
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:09,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Samsung one is like the king.

839
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:21,390
Speaker 0: Yeah the Samsung a Samsung is basically like conquered the world of storage in terms of solid-state storage because they had it conquered before Back in the day like you would if you buy like, you know an Apple iPhone.

840
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:24,202
Speaker 0: There's an SSD chip in there.

841
00:53:24,342 --> 00:53:26,150
Speaker 0: It doesn't have a spinning magnet drive anymore.

842
00:53:26,572 --> 00:53:29,130
Speaker 0: Right and guess who makes that fucking Samsung, right?

843
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:36,950
Speaker 0: You know, I ever since the iPod stopped having spinning magnet drives in it Samsung has been like the king of solid-state storage.

844
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:44,664
Speaker 0: So you can when I first built this which is why see gay and Western Digital and such are in trouble That now people are moving to solid-state storage.

845
00:53:44,744 --> 00:53:45,930
Speaker 0: I paid spinning magnets.

846
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:50,162
Speaker 1: I paid almost four hundred dollars for a 32 gigabyte SSD to put my OS on.

847
00:53:50,263 --> 00:53:54,877
Speaker 1: well now right now the Samsung 850 Evo is an SSD.

848
00:53:55,137 --> 00:53:58,488
Speaker 1: you get a 500 gigabyte one for a hundred and sixty bucks.

849
00:53:58,588 --> 00:53:59,250
Speaker 0: Damn, son.

850
00:53:59,452 --> 00:54:02,733
Speaker 1: No, but they have a four Terabyte version.

851
00:54:02,794 --> 00:54:04,038
Speaker 1: It's a thousand dollars.

852
00:54:04,058 --> 00:54:05,583
Speaker 1: Let's see the two terabyte.

853
00:54:05,603 --> 00:54:07,610
Speaker 0: I mean, it's still not it's you know, it's it's way.

854
00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:10,679
Speaker 0: okay, the two terabyte is 620 it's still a lot.

855
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:15,378
Speaker 1: the one terabyte is 350 that's that's reasonable.

856
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:18,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, like that's I could go for that if I was going high-end.

857
00:54:18,411 --> 00:54:21,410
Speaker 1: However, that is a normal SSD using SATA, right?

858
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:38,006
Speaker 0: So the m2 drives have this advantage where if you put if you have one and your motherboard is right and your m2 drive is Right and you get the good ones Even though you plug it into the same hole on the motherboard you configure in the BIOS and whatnot properly It won't actually be an SATA device.

859
00:54:38,288 --> 00:54:43,580
Speaker 0: It will be Considered by the computer a PCI Express device X4.

860
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:49,918
Speaker 1: I it's the max sequential read from this drive Two thousand five hundred megabits per second.

861
00:54:50,039 --> 00:54:52,909
Speaker 0: I can't even imagine like how fat your computer will turn on.

862
00:54:52,949 --> 00:54:55,061
Speaker 0: like boop It's on cuz it'll load so fast.

863
00:54:55,081 --> 00:54:56,450
Speaker 0: you put like Photoshop on there.

864
00:54:56,450 --> 00:54:58,810
Speaker 0: You know when you start Photoshop, it shows you this little splash screen.

865
00:54:58,951 --> 00:55:03,594
Speaker 0: Yeah, this splash screen will be there for like a fraction of a second cuz big boot loaded Like little.

866
00:55:03,614 --> 00:55:07,090
Speaker 0: let you install a video game on there from steam has levels that take a long time to load.

867
00:55:07,432 --> 00:55:08,498
Speaker 1: No boot loaded now.

868
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:10,370
Speaker 1: These drives are still too small.

869
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:17,370
Speaker 1: Like you don't want to put stuff on them You pretty much buy them to put your OS all your games all your applications on them.

870
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:19,809
Speaker 0: You can't there's not enough room on these to put anything else.

871
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:24,810
Speaker 0: But now if you put your OS and your applications you frequently used applications on there.

872
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:27,005
Speaker 0: I wouldn't put unfrequently used applications on there.

873
00:55:27,025 --> 00:55:28,051
Speaker 0: Yes, you'll fill it up Like it.

874
00:55:28,071 --> 00:55:31,483
Speaker 1: basically I'm gonna put your computer story games like another disk.

875
00:55:31,543 --> 00:55:34,077
Speaker 0: things will be so fast You won't eat.

876
00:55:34,219 --> 00:55:35,310
Speaker 0: Oh my god, it's crazy.

877
00:55:35,631 --> 00:55:46,564
Speaker 1: And this is why this is crazy because right now the Samsung 950 Pro which not only does it do all the things Scott said But it is just like one of the higher performing SSDs out there m2 ones.

878
00:55:46,745 --> 00:55:48,832
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's 300 bucks That's pretty.

879
00:55:48,973 --> 00:55:50,578
Speaker 0: that's pretty good for 512 gigs.

880
00:55:50,598 --> 00:55:51,441
Speaker 0: You know, that's all you need.

881
00:55:51,441 --> 00:55:54,170
Speaker 0: 512 is what I need for my OS and apps.

882
00:55:54,391 --> 00:55:57,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, the 256 gig one is not significantly cheaper anymore.

883
00:55:57,890 --> 00:56:01,184
Speaker 0: The only negative of it being 512 is that in steam.

884
00:56:01,345 --> 00:56:02,570
Speaker 0: which steam has this feature?

885
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:07,850
Speaker 0: Luckily also battle net has it as well as you can tell it at Adobe Creative Cloud.

886
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:11,070
Speaker 0: Also, you can tell it where to put each individual app.

887
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:18,010
Speaker 0: So you have another drive and you might have to say alright install Photoshop on the m2 because I use that a lot.

888
00:56:18,573 --> 00:56:20,201
Speaker 0: I don't use speedgrade a lot.

889
00:56:20,542 --> 00:56:22,010
Speaker 0: You could install that on this SSD.

890
00:56:22,211 --> 00:56:26,410
Speaker 0: That's a normal one and it'll load a little bit slower, but at least I won't fill up my m2 drive.

891
00:56:26,671 --> 00:56:29,598
Speaker 0: So spinning this install install that game.

892
00:56:29,638 --> 00:56:32,686
Speaker 0: I play every day civ6 on the m2 drive.

893
00:56:32,706 --> 00:56:33,568
Speaker 0: So it loads fast.

894
00:56:34,009 --> 00:56:36,082
Speaker 0: that game I'm gonna play once and then delete.

895
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:36,948
Speaker 0: you can put that on the SSD.

896
00:56:37,592 --> 00:56:48,368
Speaker 1: so because I work with a lot of video all the time spinning to still have their use and I'd like to have something fast instead of a NAS and I'm you know I can't afford like a super expensive sand or anything crazy.

897
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:54,625
Speaker 1: Spinning discs for the things that they're useful for are also crazy cheap.

898
00:56:54,645 --> 00:56:56,110
Speaker 0: They've been crazy cheap for a long time.

899
00:56:56,331 --> 00:56:57,729
Speaker 0: But what they're getting bigger though?

900
00:56:57,950 --> 00:56:58,933
Speaker 1: Yeah So here's the thing.

901
00:56:58,993 --> 00:57:02,406
Speaker 0: right now my NAS is has four two terabytes ones.

902
00:57:02,486 --> 00:57:05,744
Speaker 0: if I bought a NAS today It would have at least four four terabyte ones.

903
00:57:05,764 --> 00:57:10,020
Speaker 1: So Western digital blacks are like the high-performance ones.

904
00:57:10,041 --> 00:57:13,010
Speaker 1: They're not like 10,000 rpm like crazy bullshit.

905
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:15,579
Speaker 0: Yeah, those are just like high-end nice magnetic drive.

906
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:17,465
Speaker 1: Yeah, five terabyte ones.

907
00:57:17,786 --> 00:57:18,970
Speaker 1: You can get a pair of them.

908
00:57:19,231 --> 00:57:20,178
Speaker 0: I don't trust five.

909
00:57:20,702 --> 00:57:21,710
Speaker 0: I only trust even numbers.

910
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:26,209
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the six is way more expensive and the four is not cheaper enough.

911
00:57:26,932 --> 00:57:31,650
Speaker 1: So the price point like the magic price point for these performance drives just happens to be five terabytes.

912
00:57:32,212 --> 00:57:33,376
Speaker 0: Mmm, I don't try that.

913
00:57:33,396 --> 00:57:34,199
Speaker 0: I don't trust five.

914
00:57:34,239 --> 00:57:34,801
Speaker 0: It seems weird.

915
00:57:34,821 --> 00:57:35,424
Speaker 0: Like is that?

916
00:57:35,604 --> 00:57:36,989
Speaker 0: why does 60 big round number?

917
00:57:37,531 --> 00:57:39,210
Speaker 0: I know you just gave me the big round number.

918
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:46,170
Speaker 0: I don't trust things that aren't even numbers right like for example that they gave me a loaner laptop at work today.

919
00:57:46,371 --> 00:57:49,249
Speaker 0: Yeah, it has 12 gigs of RAM and I'm like what?

920
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:52,336
Speaker 1: No That's an even number.

921
00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:57,314
Speaker 0: It's not even power of two Sixteen thirty two.

922
00:57:57,334 --> 00:57:58,959
Speaker 0: See none is twelve.

923
00:57:59,099 --> 00:58:02,570
Speaker 1: this computer the geek night's rig has 12 gigs of RAM.

924
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:04,076
Speaker 0: No, that is not allowed.

925
00:58:04,096 --> 00:58:04,458
Speaker 0: That's bad.

926
00:58:04,478 --> 00:58:05,964
Speaker 1: In fact, you know what this RAM is.

927
00:58:06,365 --> 00:58:07,470
Speaker 1: It's three-way interleave.

928
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:09,577
Speaker 1: There are six two gigabyte dims in there.

929
00:58:09,999 --> 00:58:10,601
Speaker 0: That's ridiculous.

930
00:58:10,641 --> 00:58:13,110
Speaker 1: Yeah this computer when I bought it was ridiculous.

931
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:16,106
Speaker 1: Do you know how fucking crazy you is have 12 gigabytes of RAM in this thing?

932
00:58:16,267 --> 00:58:16,810
Speaker 0: That's stupid.

933
00:58:17,653 --> 00:58:19,038
Speaker 0: I I don't trust weird numbers.

934
00:58:19,098 --> 00:58:20,342
Speaker 0: It has to be the right number.

935
00:58:20,603 --> 00:58:24,240
Speaker 0: something shady about a five terabyte drivers Like shouldn't it be a six or a four?

936
00:58:24,522 --> 00:58:25,830
Speaker 0: So anyway, how did you get five?

937
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:28,121
Speaker 1: Let me see what the what the six actually costs.

938
00:58:28,142 --> 00:58:28,866
Speaker 1: cuz I'm on the fives.

939
00:58:28,886 --> 00:58:31,917
Speaker 1: cuz for 380 I can get two of these five terabytes.

940
00:58:32,197 --> 00:58:35,407
Speaker 1: So the computer I'm building will have that sand that 950.

941
00:58:35,407 --> 00:58:38,178
Speaker 0: crazy It's not entirely sure.

942
00:58:38,218 --> 00:58:42,094
Speaker 0: I trust a one terabyte drive Even though that's an odd number.

943
00:58:42,114 --> 00:58:45,944
Speaker 1: All right, the six terabyte one is 300 bucks by itself and not on sale.

944
00:58:46,145 --> 00:58:54,684
Speaker 1: Okay, the five terabyte one is Hundred and ninety so it's two-thirds of the price for five.

945
00:58:54,785 --> 00:58:58,969
Speaker 1: six of these Stuff the four terabyte one right now.

946
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:00,917
Speaker 0: So it's 33% off the money.

947
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:04,229
Speaker 1: the four terabyte one cost more than the five terabyte one.

948
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,710
Speaker 0: Something's shady with the five terabyte one.

949
00:59:06,770 --> 00:59:09,140
Speaker 0: Maybe it's because of this psychological thing that I have.

950
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:11,570
Speaker 0: other people have it too and the five terabyte ones aren't selling.

951
00:59:11,691 --> 00:59:15,790
Speaker 0: Maybe it's my sweet spot or there's something up with the five terabyte ones and I'm right.

952
00:59:16,091 --> 00:59:17,017
Speaker 1: Well, it's got good eggs.

953
00:59:17,057 --> 00:59:18,083
Speaker 1: But anyway, here's what I'm doing.

954
00:59:18,425 --> 00:59:19,952
Speaker 1: This is the actual computer I'm gonna build.

955
00:59:20,273 --> 00:59:25,790
Speaker 1: the the Samsung 950 Pro m2 crazy nonsense is gonna be my main drive for all maps.

956
00:59:26,432 --> 00:59:38,298
Speaker 1: I'm gonna have the Samsung 850 a regular SATA drive for like all that B tier stuff and Adobe swap and Then I'm gonna have two of these five terabyte drives Mirrored for fucking everything else.

957
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:39,664
Speaker 0: What about your existing drives?

958
00:59:39,986 --> 00:59:40,890
Speaker 1: I'm leaving them in the old computer.

959
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:43,439
Speaker 0: I Always bring my drives over.

960
00:59:43,459 --> 00:59:49,470
Speaker 1: I'd used to and the problem is Every hard drive I've ever owned except the one that crashed is in this computer right now.

961
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:50,957
Speaker 1: There are like seven hard drives.

962
00:59:51,017 --> 00:59:52,805
Speaker 0: Maybe though see right now in my computer.

963
00:59:52,846 --> 00:59:53,388
Speaker 0: today, right?

964
00:59:53,468 --> 00:59:55,695
Speaker 0: I got a 512 gig SSD.

965
00:59:55,976 --> 00:59:57,199
Speaker 0: that's my main drive.

966
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:58,342
Speaker 0: then I got a one.

967
00:59:58,583 --> 01:00:12,837
Speaker 0: Oh, I think it's actually 256. then I got a 128. that's like my you know Adobe swap and then I've got like two two terabyte drives and a four terabyte drive and even some like a 500 gigs Whole bunch of magnet drive.

968
01:00:12,917 --> 01:00:15,950
Speaker 1: I got six drives two of which are SSDs in this computer.

969
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:17,262
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's basically what I have right.

970
01:00:17,302 --> 01:00:18,190
Speaker 1: so I'm done with that shit.

971
01:00:18,290 --> 01:00:23,450
Speaker 1: I want one drive of store shit one drive of swap and one drive of applications.

972
01:00:23,671 --> 01:00:24,956
Speaker 0: I might you know what if I can.

973
01:00:25,036 --> 01:00:29,793
Speaker 0: it's gonna feel so good if I wait long enough to buy a new computer just one M.2 with everything.

974
01:00:29,954 --> 01:00:34,990
Speaker 0: No, I might be able to get like a terabyte m2 and then like two terabyte.

975
01:00:35,171 --> 01:00:37,830
Speaker 0: Like if I hold out long enough to those things become cheap, right?

976
01:00:38,171 --> 01:00:42,790
Speaker 0: Like I can get big SSDs and then not have any magnets in my main computer.

977
01:00:42,830 --> 01:00:52,330
Speaker 1: The thing is then you could probably get to like 12 terabyte magnets Mirror them and just store locally fucking everything for I probably still have some magnets.

978
01:00:52,411 --> 01:01:06,710
Speaker 0: but the point is I would you know, like I can basically just get you know, even my like if it gets to the point where even a 512 gig SSD looks puny and I'll just get like yeah m2 One terabyte SSDs four terabytes each I get two of those bad boys.

979
01:01:07,812 --> 01:01:10,000
Speaker 1: The thing is I said those four drives I'm buying right.

980
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:14,017
Speaker 1: that's actually kind of important because I was gonna get a bigger case The NZXT.

981
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:15,464
Speaker 1: there was this case that we looked at it packs.

982
01:01:15,484 --> 01:01:16,046
Speaker 1: It was pretty good.

983
01:01:16,207 --> 01:01:16,770
Speaker 0: Well, okay.

984
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:17,373
Speaker 0: So there's this case.

985
01:01:17,393 --> 01:01:20,470
Speaker 0: you looked at it packs and it looked all gamery and ricey and I think it looked great.

986
01:01:20,612 --> 01:01:21,629
Speaker 1: I think it looked like this cool.

987
01:01:22,754 --> 01:01:25,161
Speaker 0: This is someone who likes, you know crappy internet.

988
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:26,686
Speaker 1: It looked like it was made of ceramic.

989
01:01:26,707 --> 01:01:27,690
Speaker 1: Like it just looked really cool.

990
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:33,610
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I went to look online at cases and this brand even though that case is ugly.

991
01:01:34,031 --> 01:01:34,974
Speaker 0: They have another case.

992
01:01:35,074 --> 01:01:36,559
Speaker 0: that actually is the first case.

993
01:01:36,599 --> 01:01:44,264
Speaker 0: that made me look at the antique cases and usually it's antique all the way Because they are so reliable in the good cases, but they had this one.

994
01:01:44,646 --> 01:01:45,790
Speaker 0: It's just a black sheet.

995
01:01:45,971 --> 01:01:48,630
Speaker 0: The only thing it had was a window, which is not great.

996
01:01:48,831 --> 01:01:57,704
Speaker 0: I'd rather have no window there, but if that's the only thing that's crummy about it is basically it looked like you know Monolith just perfectly black and smooth and I'm like damn son functionality was.

997
01:01:57,724 --> 01:02:07,750
Speaker 1: the only difference between this and the case I was originally gonna get is that this one's actually way smaller But still ATX and it only holds four drive two SSDs and two two magnets.

998
01:02:08,131 --> 01:02:12,584
Speaker 0: I actually can hold three drives inside underneath this like cover area.

999
01:02:12,624 --> 01:02:14,530
Speaker 1: So yeah, I think you can spit one more like.

1000
01:02:15,090 --> 01:02:20,651
Speaker 0: It's a little tricky because I watch some YouTube videos and you have to like if you want to put the three drives under there It.

1001
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:23,209
Speaker 0: basically this is a little hidey hole where the PS the power supply goes.

1002
01:02:23,872 --> 01:02:27,024
Speaker 0: You have to put those drives in first before you put the power supply it.

1003
01:02:27,105 --> 01:02:28,349
Speaker 0: Otherwise, it's gonna be a pain in the ass.

1004
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:30,075
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you basically put your.

1005
01:02:30,556 --> 01:02:39,329
Speaker 0: you can either put three magnet drives or two magnet drives and an SSD under the hood And then there's two SSDs that go above the hood And then your m2 drive.

1006
01:02:39,711 --> 01:02:47,430
Speaker 1: So the other case had a lot of drive bays because my original plan when I first specked out the computer and five terabyte drive.

1007
01:02:47,470 --> 01:02:53,420
Speaker 0: This does not have a five and a quarter drive, but you cannot put an internal CD ROM in this.

1008
01:02:53,480 --> 01:03:01,710
Speaker 1: it does not have any External drive bays which means the front is smooth and baffled which actually solves a lot of noise problems.

1009
01:03:01,973 --> 01:03:07,582
Speaker 1: Yep, like that's actually Like we're deciding to have zero and it has the way it has.

1010
01:03:08,124 --> 01:03:11,376
Speaker 0: I put my computer, you know on the flow I don't put it up on the desk Yep.

1011
01:03:11,672 --> 01:03:25,550
Speaker 0: And this has its USB External headphone holes and stuff on the top facing straight up not at some angle not forward Straight up which is optimal for a computer that is on the ground Especially because it is shorter than the average ATX.

1012
01:03:25,610 --> 01:03:29,790
Speaker 0: But it has feet that are slightly taller to keep it up off the ground.

1013
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:33,826
Speaker 0: Yes, but if you're not have a carpeted floor then the PSU is blowing straight down.

1014
01:03:34,167 --> 01:03:34,750
Speaker 0: That's really good.

1015
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:39,270
Speaker 1: But this case just looks great and you're going along with it with the modern era of chips.

1016
01:03:39,351 --> 01:03:42,070
Speaker 1: The one thing about that Intel chips that it doesn't come with a fan anymore.

1017
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:47,027
Speaker 0: So if you get an Intel chip these days some of them come with heatsinks with fans.

1018
01:03:47,147 --> 01:03:47,328
Speaker 1: only.

1019
01:03:47,368 --> 01:03:51,284
Speaker 0: the slower ones Those are the normal ones like the one I got in my HTPC is i5.

1020
01:03:51,364 --> 01:03:52,228
Speaker 0: it just came with a fan.

1021
01:03:52,268 --> 01:03:52,810
Speaker 0: it works great.

1022
01:03:52,950 --> 01:04:00,297
Speaker 0: But the ones with the letter K that means they're unlocked for overclock purposes Which and nowadays you don't even have to like.

1023
01:04:00,718 --> 01:04:04,310
Speaker 0: we're not talking about overclocking like tweaking and stuff and breaking your computer.

1024
01:04:04,330 --> 01:04:20,819
Speaker 0: This is like a supported overclock feature where you tell your motherboard Listen, just go as fast as you can go safely and it will just automatically go as fast as it can go safely as necessary Within the limits of cooling, you know You can

1025
01:04:20,839 --> 01:04:23,230
Speaker 1: still do the crazy tweaks and like up your ramp

1026
01:04:24,973 --> 01:04:25,535
Speaker 0: But you don't.

1027
01:04:25,575 --> 01:04:35,810
Speaker 0: you can just say auto overclock and it's a supported feature from Intel and As you just all you have to do is make your CPU cool and it will go as fast as it can go as needed.

1028
01:04:36,453 --> 01:04:40,390
Speaker 1: The result of this you pretty much need a radiator if you're gonna use your computer.

1029
01:04:40,491 --> 01:04:44,330
Speaker 0: These K unlocked CPUs do not come with a heatsink.

1030
01:04:44,350 --> 01:04:54,690
Speaker 0: You need to provide your own and you would like a quiet one and you would also like whether it's really good Because the better it is the more safer it's gonna be and you'll get more performance just by making it colder.

1031
01:04:54,831 --> 01:05:01,666
Speaker 1: So to keep these things cool in these small cases You would need this like with a traditional heatsink like what we're used to.

1032
01:05:01,706 --> 01:05:04,132
Speaker 0: you need some monster Monster.

1033
01:05:04,152 --> 01:05:06,240
Speaker 1: that's gonna be a pain in the ass inside of your case.

1034
01:05:06,541 --> 01:05:09,029
Speaker 1: the modern era liquid cooling is like mainstream.

1035
01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:16,129
Speaker 0: now It's a liquid cooling used to be this hack thing that you would do That would be really difficult and people would mess it up and get their computers wet or they?

1036
01:05:16,189 --> 01:05:16,390
Speaker 0: you know.

1037
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:21,710
Speaker 0: It'd be hilarious and you wouldn't even go for that if you were unless you were way rich and could afford to break computer parts right.

1038
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:31,222
Speaker 0: But nowadays they sell these completely contained systems where it's like there's a heatsink you put on the CPU just like normal and it has Two hoses coming out of it connected to a radiator.

1039
01:05:31,242 --> 01:05:32,850
Speaker 0: It's all connected in the box already.

1040
01:05:32,870 --> 01:05:34,749
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's already filled with liquid already.

1041
01:05:35,111 --> 01:05:43,168
Speaker 0: Liquids not gonna come out and squirt you right and all you got to do is Put the radiator in the case and then put the heatsink on the CPU.

1042
01:05:43,188 --> 01:05:47,832
Speaker 1: now If you're a hobby and then you plug it in is done if you're a hobbyist or an overclock Like if you're.

1043
01:05:47,852 --> 01:05:58,874
Speaker 1: basically if you're like I was when I was in high school or early college You can be a little more efficient because some of the 1080 video cards because they're the same way if you cool and better They'll just work better.

1044
01:05:58,894 --> 01:06:00,058
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

1045
01:06:00,078 --> 01:06:06,202
Speaker 1: So some of the 1080s come with radiators as well, but Putting one just on your CPU seems normal.

1046
01:06:06,222 --> 01:06:07,550
Speaker 1: Like that's what you do in modern computers.

1047
01:06:07,932 --> 01:06:11,690
Speaker 1: You don't want like three different things in your computer having their own radiators.

1048
01:06:12,314 --> 01:06:14,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, so at that point there you can buy system.

1049
01:06:15,014 --> 01:06:25,390
Speaker 1: basically that's where you do the hobbyist thing where you buy a pump and you basically wire one big cooling loop of All your different components and then put a giant radiator somewhere, right?

1050
01:06:25,470 --> 01:06:28,050
Speaker 0: So the way so the way you're supposed to do this is you get this radiator.

1051
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:30,158
Speaker 0: So all the heat from the CPU is the.

1052
01:06:30,318 --> 01:06:33,510
Speaker 0: the liquid is being you know sent through right to this radiator.

1053
01:06:33,691 --> 01:06:37,229
Speaker 0: So now you need to cool the radiators that you're sending cold liquid back to the CPU.

1054
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:46,769
Speaker 0: So you have the two fans at the front of your case are pulling cool air from outside the computer Over the radiator so that air heats up and then comes into the computer.

1055
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:51,365
Speaker 0: But meanwhile the CPU a lot of these blow out as exhaust all the.

1056
01:06:51,566 --> 01:06:52,750
Speaker 0: I research this thoroughly.

1057
01:06:52,991 --> 01:06:56,430
Speaker 0: The way you want it to work is to blow the cold air in over the radiator.

1058
01:06:56,490 --> 01:07:05,260
Speaker 0: Like if you're driving a car the cold air at the front of the car comes into the radiator at the front of the car Right, and even though that brings hot air into where the engine is.

1059
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:06,805
Speaker 0: that's how it's supposed to work right.

1060
01:07:06,845 --> 01:07:09,176
Speaker 0: you cool the radiator Right.

1061
01:07:09,338 --> 01:07:14,690
Speaker 0: So even though it's hot air in your case You have a fan on the top blowing up and you have a fan in the back blowing out.

1062
01:07:14,951 --> 01:07:22,298
Speaker 0: So that shits pretty much goes going straight out and the CPU doesn't even care about that hot air Because it's only touching this cold thing that's touching it.

1063
01:07:22,699 --> 01:07:26,327
Speaker 1: So in this case though, it does look like you mount that radiator in the top.

1064
01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:28,577
Speaker 0: Oh There's a top mounting one.

1065
01:07:28,637 --> 01:07:30,569
Speaker 1: That's where this one goes in this case.

1066
01:07:31,471 --> 01:07:34,380
Speaker 0: All the screenshots I'm looking at all everything that I looked at.

1067
01:07:34,461 --> 01:07:37,410
Speaker 0: the one is one that mounted in the front with two fans.

1068
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:42,530
Speaker 0: I don't know which one you looked at the Kraken 61 like that mounts in the front.

1069
01:07:42,851 --> 01:07:44,678
Speaker 0: I watched YouTube videos that showed how to do it.

1070
01:07:44,779 --> 01:07:47,530
Speaker 1: I've seen multiple screenshots of this case with it mounted in the top.

1071
01:07:47,651 --> 01:07:48,778
Speaker 0: I've never seen such a thing.

1072
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:49,865
Speaker 0: I looked at many things.

1073
01:07:49,965 --> 01:07:50,650
Speaker 0: it goes in the front.

1074
01:07:50,951 --> 01:07:57,301
Speaker 0: it probably won't even fit in the top because the top only has one fan hole and the That cooler is a two fan hole cooler.

1075
01:07:57,542 --> 01:07:59,230
Speaker 1: Oh wait that but that might be for the video card.

1076
01:07:59,491 --> 01:07:59,652
Speaker 1: There

1077
01:07:59,792 --> 01:08:15,949
Speaker 0: is a smaller one you can get that goes that is a single fan hole cooler and if you use that it which might be sufficient actually where the radiators only one fan hole big you could actually get a Video card cooler that is one fan hole big and put them both at the front like that.

1078
01:08:16,252 --> 01:08:17,988
Speaker 1: So I saw one set up that look cool.

1079
01:08:18,372 --> 01:08:21,450
Speaker 1: But this is again where you get into the part where maybe you should use up one full loop.

1080
01:08:21,691 --> 01:08:27,310
Speaker 0: I think getting a video card that has either the blower style cooler or the three fans is just fine.

1081
01:08:28,553 --> 01:08:30,749
Speaker 0: You don't really need the liquid cooling for that.

1082
01:08:31,231 --> 01:08:37,010
Speaker 1: So the review said that the 1080s that have the radiator are way quieter.

1083
01:08:37,292 --> 01:08:39,122
Speaker 0: I'm sure they are but I mean you're already.

1084
01:08:39,363 --> 01:08:41,694
Speaker 0: it's already gonna be so quiet You're not gonna even notice.

1085
01:08:42,136 --> 01:08:44,224
Speaker 0: so does it really need to be even quieter.

1086
01:08:44,283 --> 01:08:45,689
Speaker 0: There's three fans on there.

1087
01:08:45,729 --> 01:08:47,707
Speaker 0: They don't need to go that fast and there's three of them.

1088
01:08:47,868 --> 01:08:48,573
Speaker 1: Yep It's the.

1089
01:08:48,634 --> 01:08:51,210
Speaker 1: it's the one cooler sitting in the top in those screenshots, right?

1090
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:54,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just did a Google image search instead of looking on the end the website.

1091
01:08:54,231 --> 01:08:59,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would get the two cooler because basically the thing is with these coolers is like they go with the case.

1092
01:08:59,529 --> 01:09:01,497
Speaker 0: I don't even know why they oh, yeah the moral of all this.

1093
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:05,109
Speaker 1: whatever case you buy buy the coolers made by the same company.

1094
01:09:05,331 --> 01:09:08,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz otherwise you can't trust that it's gonna fit or work properly.

1095
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:09,917
Speaker 0: I don't know why they don't sell it as a package.

1096
01:09:09,938 --> 01:09:12,529
Speaker 0: Like why doesn't the case just already have this thing built into it?

1097
01:09:12,871 --> 01:09:14,358
Speaker 0: Why do they make you buy it separately?

1098
01:09:14,377 --> 01:09:17,170
Speaker 1: You know, here's here's the Corsair one that goes in the back.

1099
01:09:17,210 --> 01:09:18,198
Speaker 1: Look at this big chunky thing.

1100
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:19,125
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a little weird.

1101
01:09:19,145 --> 01:09:19,670
Speaker 0: I don't like that.

1102
01:09:19,750 --> 01:09:26,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, it looks kind of and you know the one that goes in the front It's like, you know, I think it's so much easier to work with right?

1103
01:09:26,470 --> 01:09:28,622
Speaker 0: Cuz it's a place where fans would already normally be.

1104
01:09:29,024 --> 01:09:31,049
Speaker 0: you're putting this thing Yeah out of the way.

1105
01:09:31,111 --> 01:09:33,356
Speaker 0: You know You just have these two cables coming across.

1106
01:09:33,577 --> 01:09:37,492
Speaker 0: the one that's big and chunky in the back is covering up like the back of your Motherboard.

1107
01:09:37,511 --> 01:09:39,037
Speaker 0: it's hard to get in there and do stuff.

1108
01:09:39,299 --> 01:09:40,705
Speaker 0: What if like this jumpers under there?

1109
01:09:40,725 --> 01:09:43,073
Speaker 1: Oh my god This is the worst.

1110
01:09:43,113 --> 01:09:45,624
Speaker 1: This is if you've got so you have a big radiator.

1111
01:09:45,684 --> 01:09:47,390
Speaker 1: This is sticking off of the CPU.

1112
01:09:48,051 --> 01:09:49,136
Speaker 1: It's directly on the CPU.

1113
01:09:49,157 --> 01:09:50,462
Speaker 1: You have this giant radio.

1114
01:09:50,524 --> 01:09:54,122
Speaker 0: It's creating a wind tunnel Yep, and a fan on it inside the case.

1115
01:09:54,183 --> 01:09:55,248
Speaker 0: That's a little weird.

1116
01:09:55,409 --> 01:10:03,434
Speaker 0: plus I mean 120 millimeter fans are so big that they're quiet and a lot of cases now these days are even having fans even bigger Than that, right?

1117
01:10:03,675 --> 01:10:03,936
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1118
01:10:04,258 --> 01:10:14,832
Speaker 0: Also, I can't tell you my htbc that I built recently I bought like these slightly more expensive fancy highly rated fans and They're just better.

1119
01:10:14,972 --> 01:10:15,694
Speaker 0: they are better.

1120
01:10:15,714 --> 01:10:19,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're slight they're not super better, but they're better.

1121
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:25,085
Speaker 0: You know, they came with like these extra bits and they were super smooth, okay here I found an example of this.

1122
01:10:25,125 --> 01:10:33,018
Speaker 1: guy's got his g-force is 1080 and his CPU Both going to a front radiator and he has a separate pump.

1123
01:10:33,981 --> 01:10:34,623
Speaker 0: See, that's a cut.

1124
01:10:34,644 --> 01:10:35,507
Speaker 0: That's that's nonsense.

1125
01:10:35,587 --> 01:10:37,133
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna have one of these reservoirs.

1126
01:10:37,314 --> 01:10:38,157
Speaker 1: Yeah my computer.

1127
01:10:38,217 --> 01:10:38,860
Speaker 0: It's not happening.

1128
01:10:39,542 --> 01:10:41,080
Speaker 0: It's not an out-of-the-box solution.

1129
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:46,779
Speaker 0: The point is you want for cooling you want an out-of-the-box solution that is guaranteed to be compatible with your other bits.

1130
01:10:48,302 --> 01:10:49,446
Speaker 0: Are there any other computer parts?

1131
01:10:49,506 --> 01:10:51,012
Speaker 0: we gotta discuss the only other.

1132
01:10:51,093 --> 01:10:52,940
Speaker 1: so that's my whole computer except PSU.

1133
01:10:53,463 --> 01:11:00,151
Speaker 1: just use one of those calculators and then like Whatever like, you know, it's like five fifty six fifty seven fifty.

1134
01:11:00,632 --> 01:11:02,940
Speaker 1: Whatever one is above your number.

1135
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:05,246
Speaker 1: I mean, let's real close that realistically.

1136
01:11:05,306 --> 01:11:12,600
Speaker 0: realistically people are buying psu's that are way more powerful than they need or I think some Of those psu's are like falsely advertising how powerful they are.

1137
01:11:12,682 --> 01:11:21,667
Speaker 0: The point is even for a computer with like the newest i7 and a 1080 and a bunch of drives and a bunch of USB devices like a 650 is already overkill.

1138
01:11:21,707 --> 01:11:25,340
Speaker 0: Five fifty is gonna get the job done very very nicely.

1139
01:11:25,340 --> 01:11:32,280
Speaker 0: 758 59 a 650 is like safety zone just because you just you just feel safer with more power.

1140
01:11:32,381 --> 01:11:38,211
Speaker 0: But like you don't even need that five 50 or an 850. if you have one ally with two video cards

1141
01:11:38,232 --> 01:11:42,425
Speaker 1: if I'm doing SLI and I have a custom cooling rig that requires More power or

1142
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:51,311
Speaker 0: if you've got like really like a ton of drives Like you have a giant case and the whole front is just filled with drives Yeah, then you might need 750. but like 850 950 a thousand.

1143
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:54,365
Speaker 0: I see these things on.

1144
01:11:54,405 --> 01:11:56,053
Speaker 0: like that people are buying.

1145
01:11:56,375 --> 01:11:57,500
Speaker 0: there is no reason to buy that.

1146
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:58,062
Speaker 0: You're just.

1147
01:11:58,182 --> 01:12:02,860
Speaker 0: I don't know if you're wasting your electric bill because it might not pull more electricity than it needs from the wall.

1148
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:09,207
Speaker 0: But there's no reason you're spending more money on the power supply for no reason just because you like bigger numbers Motherboard.

1149
01:12:09,267 --> 01:12:13,940
Speaker 1: so the aces Z170s are pretty much fine, right?

1150
01:12:14,060 --> 01:12:21,555
Speaker 0: So if you're getting the K CPU with the auto overclocking you need to get the z170 Chipset on the motherboard or it won't work.

1151
01:12:21,777 --> 01:12:25,322
Speaker 0: I think the Can't choose any other Chipsets.

1152
01:12:25,342 --> 01:12:30,160
Speaker 0: you have to get a motherboard with that chipset and it's hard to tell which motherboard is the best.

1153
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:33,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the reviews on this aces are 50% of them are.

1154
01:12:33,290 --> 01:12:34,895
Speaker 1: this is amazing and the other 50% are.

1155
01:12:35,116 --> 01:12:36,280
Speaker 1: it came do a guy.

1156
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:38,970
Speaker 0: So it's like every motherboard no matter how highly rated on.

1157
01:12:39,010 --> 01:12:39,713
Speaker 0: Newegg is like.

1158
01:12:39,753 --> 01:12:45,040
Speaker 0: it seems like a perfect motherboard on paper But a whole bunch of reviews are like this thing just totally didn't work.

1159
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:47,189
Speaker 0: I had to send it back or it worked for a while.

1160
01:12:47,229 --> 01:12:48,736
Speaker 0: then it broke and it's like man.

1161
01:12:48,756 --> 01:12:50,042
Speaker 0: the thing I'm looking for is Stability.

1162
01:12:50,123 --> 01:12:53,000
Speaker 0: I got a blue screen and computer and you're telling me to sell me a motherboard.

1163
01:12:53,281 --> 01:12:56,573
Speaker 0: We're half the people who buy it have it like messing up and not working.

1164
01:12:56,633 --> 01:12:58,640
Speaker 1: It seems like they don't mess up subtly anymore.

1165
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:01,600
Speaker 1: It's either it's fucking broken or it's perfect, right?

1166
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:03,549
Speaker 0: So you might have to buy more than one.

1167
01:13:03,569 --> 01:13:11,940
Speaker 0: and if you buy a Newegg right now not we're not Sponsored by Newegg or Amazon by the way, but Newegg does have like a super bonus holiday return policy.

1168
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,320
Speaker 0: That's different from the regular holiday return policy.

1169
01:13:14,802 --> 01:13:18,839
Speaker 0: So it's a good time to buy because of that even if you missed a Black Friday sale or something.

1170
01:13:18,859 --> 01:13:28,607
Speaker 1: now There's a bunch of variance on this like even in this aces like there's a pro gaming version and a deluxe version and a saber-tooth All the same thing with all motherboards.

1171
01:13:28,707 --> 01:13:33,913
Speaker 0: get one that has the connectors you need in the size you need and ignore all that other Nonsense, right?

1172
01:13:34,298 --> 01:13:35,102
Speaker 1: Yep I mean like.

1173
01:13:35,302 --> 01:13:41,663
Speaker 1: so the one that's interesting is the tough one the saber-tooth because it's basically got this big heatsink over the entire Motherboard.

1174
01:13:41,744 --> 01:13:42,552
Speaker 0: it just looks fancy.

1175
01:13:42,572 --> 01:13:43,360
Speaker 0: that doesn't do shit.

1176
01:13:43,761 --> 01:13:48,900
Speaker 1: So look at the reviews of those things and read the text and you'll see the true story.

1177
01:13:49,001 --> 01:13:51,378
Speaker 0: For example, this one that looks like it makes it hard to work with.

1178
01:13:51,962 --> 01:13:56,025
Speaker 1: Yep, the reviews are one hard to work with - oh my god That thing's a pain in the ass.

1179
01:13:56,046 --> 01:13:57,978
Speaker 1: to get off if you have a problem and drop a screw in there.

1180
01:13:58,159 --> 01:13:59,350
Speaker 1: three I dropped a screw in there.

1181
01:13:59,390 --> 01:14:00,178
Speaker 0: What the fuck do I do?

1182
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:08,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, there is if you if you're mega mega rich they do have this Republic of Gamers equipment, right?

1183
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:09,242
Speaker 0: That's like.

1184
01:14:09,302 --> 01:14:11,092
Speaker 0: this is for the people who are just like ah fuck.

1185
01:14:11,152 --> 01:14:12,660
Speaker 0: I don't even give a shit about money, right?

1186
01:14:13,281 --> 01:14:16,899
Speaker 0: And it looked basically just like you're paying a bunch of money for nothing.

1187
01:14:17,821 --> 01:14:24,846
Speaker 0: Yeah, five hundred dollar motherboard, but it did have like twelve USB three ports on the back Which is like I need that.

1188
01:14:24,947 --> 01:14:26,474
Speaker 0: you know how many devices I have right now.

1189
01:14:26,655 --> 01:14:27,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, I need that.

1190
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:32,662
Speaker 0: Yeah, like right now all I had to buy a USB PCI Express card to add four more ports to the computer I have.

1191
01:14:32,722 --> 01:14:34,151
Speaker 1: now I like a son.

1192
01:14:34,191 --> 01:14:35,560
Speaker 1: I got USB 2 on this computer.

1193
01:14:35,901 --> 01:14:37,347
Speaker 0: Yeah, it said the other.

1194
01:14:37,427 --> 01:14:39,014
Speaker 0: that's it is something I want to mention though.

1195
01:14:39,195 --> 01:14:40,560
Speaker 0: all these new motherboards, right?

1196
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,019
Speaker 0: They have USB twos because you might as well.

1197
01:14:43,247 --> 01:14:47,616
Speaker 0: Yes They have USB threes and they have enough of them that you can get your front ports and rear ports.

1198
01:14:47,716 --> 01:14:48,579
Speaker 0: and who has that?

1199
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:49,569
Speaker 0: many USB three devices.

1200
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:58,077
Speaker 1: They'll always have like one You can plug your keyboard and mouse in the USB - you know I gotta plug mine into a three because I want to have this three hub on the top.

1201
01:14:58,097 --> 01:14:58,660
Speaker 0: Oh, you got a hub.

1202
01:14:58,761 --> 01:14:59,920
Speaker 0: Okay, make sense, right?

1203
01:15:00,981 --> 01:15:15,000
Speaker 0: This guy's plugging into a - but all of these computers have one USB 3.1 port and one USB C port and I feel like That feel like those probably work just fine, but I work like your USB 3 work, right?

1204
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:20,060
Speaker 0: It's like I feel like maybe you would since USB C is definitely gonna be a thing.

1205
01:15:20,362 --> 01:15:20,764
Speaker 0: It won't be.

1206
01:15:20,865 --> 01:15:21,831
Speaker 0: I mean Apple jumped at.

1207
01:15:21,912 --> 01:15:23,059
Speaker 0: jump the gun of it for sure.

1208
01:15:23,622 --> 01:15:35,679
Speaker 0: But if you buy a motherboard a year or year and a half from now it's gonna have like four USB C's on the back or maybe even six and you're gonna want them in the front - and These that doesn't do it today.

1209
01:15:35,846 --> 01:15:37,966
Speaker 0: so You know that could be an issue.

1210
01:15:38,046 --> 01:15:46,299
Speaker 0: where sure even if your performance and power of a computer you buy today is just fantastic And doesn't go obsolete for five six years because it that's just how things are.

1211
01:15:46,822 --> 01:15:56,020
Speaker 0: You might be sad in a year from now when you start buying a new phone and New other things that are all USB C and you have a bunch of USB C to USB 3 adapters.

1212
01:15:56,461 --> 01:16:01,159
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz you can't plug that many USB C things into your computer that only has one hole.

1213
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:02,667
Speaker 1: You can't wait for that stuff.

1214
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:06,866
Speaker 0: You can't even reach it can't wait for that stuff Forever you can't.

1215
01:16:06,926 --> 01:16:11,773
Speaker 0: but some you know, if you're on depending on your schedule It might be worth it to wait for that if you can.

1216
01:16:11,913 --> 01:16:16,215
Speaker 1: so the last thing I need to buy None of you need to buy is I need a firewire adapter.

1217
01:16:16,236 --> 01:16:17,019
Speaker 0: No one needs that.

1218
01:16:17,582 --> 01:16:21,575
Speaker 1: Yeah, like even to this day all the good per audio equipment like Mackie like all these mixers.

1219
01:16:21,996 --> 01:16:24,203
Speaker 1: There isn't a USB option It's just firewire.

1220
01:16:24,224 --> 01:16:26,330
Speaker 0: Can you get like a USB to firewire?

1221
01:16:26,731 --> 01:16:34,260
Speaker 1: No, so the reality of the world is that Most manufacturers of this stuff won't help you and will give vague advice.

1222
01:16:34,601 --> 01:16:34,943
Speaker 0: What can?

1223
01:16:35,083 --> 01:16:39,200
Speaker 0: I just ask him what computer they have that they're plugging it into a computer that has native firewire.

1224
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:40,179
Speaker 0: Which computer is that?

1225
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,407
Speaker 1: Usually it's old shit computers.

1226
01:16:42,809 --> 01:16:45,280
Speaker 1: Okay, get like this computer has firewire on the motherboard.

1227
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:47,026
Speaker 1: My age is T PZ over.

1228
01:16:47,046 --> 01:16:48,832
Speaker 1: there has firewire on the mother.

1229
01:16:48,872 --> 01:16:52,102
Speaker 0: my old my computer has a firewire and so it is my old Htpc.

1230
01:16:52,142 --> 01:17:00,308
Speaker 1: So the real problem is that low-end firewire cards are the shittiest shit that ever shed out of a poop shit Like they like those Roseville ones.

1231
01:17:00,448 --> 01:17:10,184
Speaker 0: Why not just get like the old MacBook for super cheap That's super good and use that for the audio bits because I use this audio for things like live-streaming, too Like this mix.

1232
01:17:10,204 --> 01:17:11,530
Speaker 1: the reason I have this mixer.

1233
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:12,053
Speaker 0: you could live.

1234
01:17:12,073 --> 01:17:13,640
Speaker 0: you could live stream from an old Mac with.

1235
01:17:13,902 --> 01:17:16,180
Speaker 1: Oh, I can't actually to do what I want to do.

1236
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:21,882
Speaker 1: I need if I need like a current like 3 gigahertz CPU minimum and you know It's not.

1237
01:17:21,902 --> 01:17:24,271
Speaker 0: plenty of people did live streaming with shittily.

1238
01:17:24,532 --> 01:17:26,339
Speaker 1: I want to plug multiple HD webcams in.

1239
01:17:26,359 --> 01:17:27,477
Speaker 1: I got shit I got plans for.

1240
01:17:28,202 --> 01:17:38,120
Speaker 1: But the thing is I'm really like I have this giant wedge for that because I use a lot of the stuff in it Like I can really gives me a lot of control for live streaming recording video and all this nonsense.

1241
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:46,820
Speaker 1: So I need if I knew I want to plug this firewire device into my computer because if I can't plug this mixer into my Computer, I'm just not gonna have a mixer anymore.

1242
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:52,260
Speaker 1: I'm gonna get one of those USB 3 or 3.1 or whatever like input devices and that'll be the end of that era.

1243
01:17:52,662 --> 01:17:55,179
Speaker 1: Mmm, I really like having this as my sound card.

1244
01:17:56,782 --> 01:18:01,296
Speaker 1: So TI seems to make the chipset that has the most likelihood of working.

1245
01:18:01,497 --> 01:18:02,360
Speaker 0: I'm sure it'll just work.

1246
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:04,211
Speaker 0: I bought like that USB 3 card.

1247
01:18:04,251 --> 01:18:05,539
Speaker 0: I bought that goes in the tiny PCI.

1248
01:18:06,863 --> 01:18:07,285
Speaker 0: Just work.

1249
01:18:07,345 --> 01:18:09,350
Speaker 1: so firewire cards will just work.

1250
01:18:09,450 --> 01:18:14,027
Speaker 1: if you plug hard drives into them if you plug audio or video equipment It's just Russian roulette.

1251
01:18:14,631 --> 01:18:15,859
Speaker 0: I don't see any reason why it wouldn't work.

1252
01:18:16,462 --> 01:18:23,108
Speaker 1: I have plugged this mixer into multiple Rosewill firewire adapters for my laptop and It just doesn't work.

1253
01:18:23,148 --> 01:18:24,841
Speaker 1: like the Mackie drivers just won't find it like it.

1254
01:18:24,861 --> 01:18:32,735
Speaker 1: just you cannot use it as a sound card or all the channels won't show up or It'll drop audio because most firewire cards are reportedly implemented.

1255
01:18:32,755 --> 01:18:33,900
Speaker 1: You need a good firewire card.

1256
01:18:34,341 --> 01:18:42,940
Speaker 1: I found eventually after buying three a firewire card from my laptop that works, but it uses that saw that Express slot that is also now obsolete.

1257
01:18:44,601 --> 01:18:56,615
Speaker 1: Okay, so I found this $40 sig firewire card that one person on the internet In a forum thread from two years ago said they plugged the same mixer.

1258
01:18:56,695 --> 01:18:57,980
Speaker 1: I have into it and it works.

1259
01:18:59,003 --> 01:19:03,990
Speaker 1: So well, it's a $40 experiment Mmm, so yeah, it's computer buying season.

1260
01:19:04,714 --> 01:19:05,840
Speaker 0: That's how you buy a computer.

1261
01:19:06,783 --> 01:19:12,648
Speaker 1: Yeah, you basically you plan 2017. you kind of forget how like.

1262
01:19:12,668 --> 01:19:13,451
Speaker 1: the details like.

1263
01:19:13,511 --> 01:19:16,078
Speaker 1: I don't know the details of like which motherboard which chips like.

1264
01:19:16,098 --> 01:19:19,060
Speaker 0: we didn't talk About RAM, but it's like you can go listen to our old episode.

1265
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,546
Speaker 0: It's like any DDR4 RAM.

1266
01:19:20,567 --> 01:19:23,660
Speaker 0: buy whatever is the most eggs the RAM that's like the higher like right now.

1267
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:27,939
Speaker 0: I think 2133 is like the base speed DDR4 RAM that goes.

1268
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:32,456
Speaker 0: Some people are trying to sell you on like two six six six or thirty two hundred.

1269
01:19:32,476 --> 01:19:37,899
Speaker 1: this two six six six I'm gonna get is cheaper than the 2133 from the same company and you might as well get it.

1270
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:40,508
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there's no the.

1271
01:19:40,588 --> 01:19:47,326
Speaker 0: everything I can tell is that on the newest computers that we're talking about Overclocking the RAM doesn't really get you anything.

1272
01:19:47,346 --> 01:19:49,353
Speaker 0: You will not notice it will not matter.

1273
01:19:49,373 --> 01:19:51,300
Speaker 0: You won't get extra frames, right?

1274
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:59,579
Speaker 0: You might as well just even if you buy faster RAM because it's cheaper might as well run it at 2133 Yep, or just let the computer do whatever it wants because it doesn't matter.

1275
01:19:59,893 --> 01:20:09,675
Speaker 0: Yep some of these motherboards like in the BIOS you can be like you're doing overclock me a little bit if you spend even if you're Crazy, and you're spending the $500 on the crazy motherboard to get 12 USB ports, right?

1276
01:20:12,221 --> 01:20:16,154
Speaker 0: Spending $500 on the RAM sticks to get 64 gigs of RAM?

1277
01:20:16,174 --> 01:20:17,940
Speaker 0: first of all 64 gigs of RAM is stupid.

1278
01:20:18,141 --> 01:20:18,664
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

1279
01:20:18,684 --> 01:20:23,966
Speaker 0: You can get 32 now and if you need 64 later on You're making an HDPC.

1280
01:20:24,026 --> 01:20:28,359
Speaker 1: get 1x32 and stick it in one of your two dim slots or any mother, you know 2x8.

1281
01:20:29,642 --> 01:20:32,539
Speaker 1: Now cuz you only know six small motherboards almost always have two.

1282
01:20:33,021 --> 01:20:33,402
Speaker 0: That's right.

1283
01:20:33,804 --> 01:20:37,557
Speaker 1: If you're getting a real motherboard get a 2x16 and then you can get 2x16 more.

1284
01:20:38,701 --> 01:20:40,932
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz 2x16 is significantly cheaper than 1x32.

1285
01:20:41,092 --> 01:20:48,720
Speaker 1: That's right now Yep, and don't get 8888 cuz then you're gonna want to get more RAM like two years from now when RAM cost a dollar.

1286
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:55,286
Speaker 0: Also, it's like people talk about like quad channel, but it's like I looked at and it seems like even the newest motherboards They're all just dual channel only.

1287
01:20:55,306 --> 01:20:58,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, they don't do quad channel or triple channel or whatever.

1288
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:01,349
Speaker 1: So a caveat cuz I've seen some people get this wrong.

1289
01:21:01,710 --> 01:21:07,710
Speaker 1: if you have some DDR3 lying around it will not Fucking work with the modern Intel chips.

1290
01:21:07,891 --> 01:21:09,276
Speaker 0: You are your shit.

1291
01:21:09,296 --> 01:21:10,299
Speaker 0: You need DDR4 for sure.

1292
01:21:10,782 --> 01:21:14,059
Speaker 1: Yes, now there's confusion because there's a bunch of literature saying DDR3 will work.

1293
01:21:14,461 --> 01:21:17,033
Speaker 1: That is true in a very specific situation.

1294
01:21:17,073 --> 01:21:18,988
Speaker 1: that I guarantee does not apply to you Right,

1295
01:21:19,091 --> 01:21:29,360
Speaker 0: but yeah You don't try to overclock like if you spend a bunch of money to get the crazy fast RAM like 3600 speed RAM You just wasted a whole bunch of money and a whole lot of nope

1296
01:21:29,761 --> 01:21:33,876
Speaker 1: But if you have what you think is perfectly good RAM from your previous computer do not

1297
01:21:33,916 --> 01:21:34,920
Speaker 0: put it in a new computer.

1298
01:21:34,940 --> 01:21:36,530
Speaker 1: We switch from three to four.

1299
01:21:36,832 --> 01:21:38,040
Speaker 1: three won't work in four.

1300
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:40,432
Speaker 1: In fact three pulls so much voltage you might break your motherboard.

1301
01:21:40,452 --> 01:21:45,230
Speaker 0: whenever you buy a motherboard Look and see what RAM the motherboard wants and buy that RAM.

1302
01:21:45,290 --> 01:21:55,341
Speaker 1: do not buy any other Rams and do a quick Google search for The exact RAM you're buying and the exact motherboard you're buying because there's a chance you'll find a forum thread where someone says the shit Didn't work.

1303
01:21:55,763 --> 01:21:55,943
Speaker 0: Yep.

1304
01:21:56,144 --> 01:22:00,357
Speaker 0: Usually the motherboard manufacturers website has like a list of approved RAM brands.

1305
01:22:00,417 --> 01:22:00,597
Speaker 0: Yep.

1306
01:22:00,617 --> 01:22:01,279
Speaker 1: Buy one of those.

1307
01:22:06,855 --> 01:22:09,390
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
