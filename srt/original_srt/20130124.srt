1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,628
Speaker 0: Hey, it's Thursday, January 24th, 2012.

2
00:00:10,628 --> 00:00:11,310
Speaker 0: Thirteen, I ran.

3
00:00:14,362 --> 00:00:16,079
Speaker 1: Did you say Tuesday or Thursday?

4
00:00:17,321 --> 00:00:18,060
Speaker 0: I think I said Thursday.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,598
Speaker 0: I definitely said Thursday, and tonight we're talking about parking.

6
00:00:24,881 --> 00:00:26,389
Speaker 1: Parks-ing.

7
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:28,219
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

8
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,700
Speaker 0: So as many of you know, it was recently my birthday.

9
00:00:32,704 --> 00:00:34,219
Speaker 0: I survived carousel and all that.

10
00:00:35,407 --> 00:00:35,997
Speaker 1: Or did you?

11
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:38,880
Speaker 1: Maybe in the world of Logan's Run.

12
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,280
Speaker 1: It's so far in the distant future, right?

13
00:00:41,606 --> 00:00:42,119
Speaker 1: I have a theory.

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:42,840
Speaker 0: You have a theory?

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:43,149
Speaker 1: Yep.

16
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:51,779
Speaker 1: Logan's Run is so far in the future that when they say 30 years, a year for them is not the same as a year for us.

17
00:00:54,342 --> 00:00:54,423
Speaker 0: Okay.

18
00:00:54,865 --> 00:00:58,983
Speaker 0: That has no relevance on whether or not I made it to 30.

19
00:00:58,983 --> 00:00:59,558
Speaker 1: No, it does.

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,900
Speaker 0: And look at the people they killed in Logan's Run.

21
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,008
Speaker 0: They're all about 30.

22
00:01:03,008 --> 00:01:04,420
Speaker 0: You've seen Logan's Run.

23
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:07,640
Speaker 1: But people also age differently in Logan's Run.

24
00:01:08,203 --> 00:01:09,218
Speaker 0: Ah, I don't think they actually did.

25
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:10,897
Speaker 1: I'm saying they did.

26
00:01:11,741 --> 00:01:16,880
Speaker 1: See, they're actually 300, but 300-year-olds in that world look like 30-year-olds in this world.

27
00:01:17,301 --> 00:01:20,900
Speaker 1: So you didn't actually survive carousel until you're 300, so you're good.

28
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:27,080
Speaker 0: So our friend Judith came over, and her Natalie, and she made me some cupcakes for my birthday, made with whiskey and beer.

29
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,400
Speaker 1: Making cupcakes, making whiskey cupcakes.

30
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:29,938
Speaker 1: You like that?

31
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:33,560
Speaker 0: I like your reference to Adventure Time, the thing you haven't actually seen.

32
00:01:33,822 --> 00:01:34,409
Speaker 1: I can do that.

33
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,339
Speaker 1: Just like you can do that.

34
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:38,840
Speaker 1: Except the only difference is that when I do that, I don't pretend to have seen the thing.

35
00:01:38,921 --> 00:01:41,180
Speaker 0: What have I referenced that I don't know anything about?

36
00:01:41,886 --> 00:01:42,380
Speaker 1: All the things.

37
00:01:42,621 --> 00:01:42,867
Speaker 0: Like what?

38
00:01:42,907 --> 00:01:43,460
Speaker 0: Name one thing.

39
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,320
Speaker 1: Everything ever.

40
00:01:45,122 --> 00:01:47,140
Speaker 0: I did enjoy how you were at a magfest.

41
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,535
Speaker 0: You were like, "Check out that cute

42
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:48,879
Speaker 0: scarf."

43
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,000
Speaker 0: And it was clearly LSP, Lumpy Space Princess.

44
00:01:52,322 --> 00:01:53,419
Speaker 1: I have no idea what that is.

45
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,018
Speaker 0: From Adventure Time, but you didn't know who that was.

46
00:01:55,581 --> 00:02:06,379
Speaker 0: And you thought it was cute, which I thought was ironic, because if you watch the show, of all the characters you've ever seen in pretty much any animated thing, Akio, you probably hate the most.

47
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,780
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure you're gonna hate Lumpy Space.

48
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,840
Speaker 1: I hate Akio the most.

49
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,336
Speaker 0: Who do you hate more than Akio?

50
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:13,560
Speaker 1: I mean, Akio's bad.

51
00:02:14,365 --> 00:02:15,213
Speaker 0: He is the worst.

52
00:02:15,233 --> 00:02:15,799
Speaker 0: You hate someone more.

53
00:02:16,162 --> 00:02:18,360
Speaker 1: But it's not like annoying when Akio's on screen.

54
00:02:19,323 --> 00:02:20,520
Speaker 1: That's the character you hate the most.

55
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,399
Speaker 1: It's the one where it's like every time they come on screen, you're like, "Get the fuck

56
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:23,520
Speaker 1: off.".

57
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:25,439
Speaker 1: Why are you even in the show?

58
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,239
Speaker 0: So Wesley Crusher?

59
00:02:26,441 --> 00:02:29,279
Speaker 1: Every scene with you is an annoying scene.

60
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:36,219
Speaker 0: You see, Scott, if you were gonna make a Star Wars joke like your non-joke before, not having seen Star Wars, you're just Star Trek.

61
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:38,020
Speaker 0: I keep saying Star Wars.

62
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:44,600
Speaker 1: Well, it's funny you mention Star Wars, because my example was going to be Jar Jar Binks, right?

63
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,060
Speaker 1: Not evil and hated like the Akio, right?

64
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,874
Speaker 1: But hated as in, "Get the fuck out of here.

65
00:02:50,915 --> 00:02:51,860
Speaker 1: Why are you in the show?

66
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,097
Speaker 1: I hate you because I don't want to see

67
00:02:54,138 --> 00:02:54,238
Speaker 1: you.".

68
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,380
Speaker 0: That's basically a meta hate, like you hate for a meta reason.

69
00:02:58,001 --> 00:03:01,980
Speaker 1: When someone says hating a character, that's usually the kind of hate that I usually think about.

70
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:08,160
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll separate the two, because Jar Jar Binks is more annoying than Akio, and I like seeing Akio on screen, but he is just a bad person.

71
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:15,373
Speaker 1: Because I usually don't hate characters in fictional things for being evil, because it's not like they're actually Hitler.

72
00:03:15,433 --> 00:03:16,680
Speaker 1: It's a fictional person.

73
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:17,880
Speaker 0: You're gonna pull the Luke Morgan.

74
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,709
Speaker 0: You're gonna pull the Luke Morgan.

75
00:03:19,749 --> 00:03:21,200
Speaker 0: The evil's just doing its job.

76
00:03:21,321 --> 00:03:22,532
Speaker 1: Well, no, I'm not saying that.

77
00:03:22,653 --> 00:03:23,420
Speaker 1: Evil is still bad.

78
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,049
Speaker 1: But it's like, Megatron.

79
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,337
Speaker 1: He's totally sweet.

80
00:03:26,377 --> 00:03:26,860
Speaker 1: I don't hate him.

81
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,558
Speaker 0: Because he's awesome.

82
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,200
Speaker 1: It's like, evil dudes in fiction are just the best, awesomest characters.

83
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,199
Speaker 0: Well, really, Starscream.

84
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,680
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, Starscream is totally sweet, even though he's a dick, right?

85
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,579
Speaker 1: But it's like, I don't hate him.

86
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,726
Speaker 1: Soundwave.

87
00:03:40,746 --> 00:03:41,796
Speaker 1: You love Soundwave.

88
00:03:41,856 --> 00:03:42,200
Speaker 1: Come on.

89
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,120
Speaker 0: So we went out to the diner, and we had one of those moments that just paralyzed everyone with laughter.

90
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,106
Speaker 0: So we're sitting there, right?

91
00:03:47,287 --> 00:03:49,420
Speaker 0: We got some water at the diner, about to get some food.

92
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:51,640
Speaker 1: Was there a hobo fucking a rabbit outside the diner?

93
00:03:53,124 --> 00:03:53,818
Speaker 0: Making a hobbit.

94
00:03:56,001 --> 00:03:59,414
Speaker 0: So, Judith... I told her, I'm gonna talk about this on Geek Nights.

95
00:03:59,475 --> 00:04:00,460
Speaker 0: I took pictures of this.

96
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,920
Speaker 0: I was like, this is the moment.

97
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,280
Speaker 0: So we're sitting there, and she doesn't say anything.

98
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,439
Speaker 0: She lifts her arm and just kind of fumbles it.

99
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:17,959
Speaker 0: And basically, if you were just watching as a bystander, she just straight up fucking punches a glass of water off the table, and water goes everywhere.

100
00:04:18,447 --> 00:04:19,238
Speaker 1: Did she really do that?

101
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:19,661
Speaker 0: Yes.

102
00:04:19,862 --> 00:04:22,070
Speaker 0: She just punched the water, and it goes flying.

103
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,030
Speaker 0: So we all pause.

104
00:04:25,534 --> 00:04:26,360
Speaker 0: No one does anything.

105
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,720
Speaker 0: And she puts her head down, and she's almost about to laugh.

106
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:34,640
Speaker 0: And I'm like, you realize the only thing you can do after this is stand up, flip everyone off, and walk out of the diner.

107
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,537
Speaker 0: Because then they'll think, we're the assholes.

108
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,120
Speaker 0: So then she starts laughing harder.

109
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:46,640
Speaker 0: And while she's laughing, the diner dude comes over with the biggest safety cone I have ever seen.

110
00:04:47,383 --> 00:04:51,020
Speaker 0: And puts it on top of this spill of water like, oh shit, look out.

111
00:04:52,081 --> 00:04:52,777
Speaker 0: And that was the end.

112
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:53,926
Speaker 0: This thing was huge.

113
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:55,399
Speaker 0: It was almost as tall as I am.

114
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,120
Speaker 0: It was like five feet tall.

115
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,380
Speaker 0: Was it wearing a Naruto costume?

116
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,489
Speaker 0: No, it was yellow.

117
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:00,279
Speaker 0: It wasn't orange.

118
00:05:02,008 --> 00:05:02,135
Speaker 0: Orange?

119
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,839
Speaker 0: But I have another anecdote that I'm surprised not many people really commented on.

120
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,219
Speaker 1: Orange crayon?

121
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:07,820
Speaker 0: So I tweeted something.

122
00:05:08,222 --> 00:05:10,139
Speaker 0: Well, has anything happened to you in the last day?

123
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,500
Speaker 0: Before I pull up my Twitter and read verbatim the tweet I tweeted recently?

124
00:05:14,103 --> 00:05:17,739
Speaker 1: The only thing that's happened to me in the past day is, number one, woman it's cold.

125
00:05:18,162 --> 00:05:18,579
Speaker 0: It's cold.

126
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,559
Speaker 1: And number two, your apartment smells real bad.

127
00:05:21,563 --> 00:05:23,520
Speaker 1: I've had to spend time in its smelliness.

128
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,880
Speaker 0: It smells like wet plaster because a pipe exploded, but that's not my anecdote.

129
00:05:29,303 --> 00:05:30,780
Speaker 0: That's an anecdote for another day.

130
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,019
Speaker 0: So yesterday I tweeted, and I tweeted something that not many people responded to.

131
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,980
Speaker 0: Quote, me, an older gentleman just straight peed on my shoe.

132
00:05:40,984 --> 00:05:42,320
Speaker 1: Did a guy really pee on your shoe?

133
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:46,400
Speaker 0: Yes, an old man peed on my shoe yesterday.

134
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,398
Speaker 1: What the fuck?

135
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,827
Speaker 0: He peed on my shoe.

136
00:05:48,847 --> 00:05:50,700
Speaker 0: No words were exchanged.

137
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,910
Speaker 1: When did you tweet this?

138
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:52,779
Speaker 1: that no one saw it?

139
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,960
Speaker 1: Because that's the kind of tweet that people would see and reply to.

140
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,231
Speaker 0: You'd think that, and I tweeted it at 1256

141
00:05:59,231 --> 00:05:59,593
Speaker 0: p.m.,

142
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:01,380
Speaker 0: which is right when the dude peed on me.

143
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,435
Speaker 1: Why were you doing in a place where someone could pee on you at 1

144
00:06:04,435 --> 00:06:04,515
Speaker 1: p.m.?

145
00:06:04,515 --> 00:06:07,844
Speaker 1: ?

146
00:06:07,844 --> 00:06:09,159
Speaker 0: I was in a bathroom at least.

147
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,020
Speaker 1: Oh, you were in a bathroom and he peed on your shoe.

148
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,980
Speaker 1: It wasn't on a subway platform.

149
00:06:13,261 --> 00:06:13,906
Speaker 0: No, it wasn't like.

150
00:06:13,926 --> 00:06:15,659
Speaker 0: he walked over, opened up, and just peed.

151
00:06:16,564 --> 00:06:17,638
Speaker 0: But he did pee on me.

152
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,940
Speaker 0: So one guy tweeted back, he's like, what, on the subway?

153
00:06:23,203 --> 00:06:24,519
Speaker 1: He was thinking the same thing as me.

154
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,320
Speaker 0: And one other guy was like, he peed on your shoe, and you still consider him a gentleman?

155
00:06:28,841 --> 00:06:31,280
Speaker 0: I don't know, I use the word gentleman to refer to old men, basically.

156
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,740
Speaker 0: So here's the deal.

157
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,940
Speaker 1: Use the word gentleman ironically or sarcastically.

158
00:06:37,782 --> 00:06:40,979
Speaker 0: And I walk in at the same time as an old man and a younger man.

159
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,679
Speaker 0: And all of us go into stalls.

160
00:06:43,562 --> 00:06:44,679
Speaker 0: I'm going into a stall because I've got to poo.

161
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:49,440
Speaker 0: I think the young man was going into a stall because he was intimidated that there were other people.

162
00:06:50,622 --> 00:06:52,479
Speaker 0: And some people can't pee on a stage.

163
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,113
Speaker 1: Weird people.

164
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,579
Speaker 0: And the third old man went into a stall to pee, I don't know why, as an old man.

165
00:06:58,321 --> 00:07:03,000
Speaker 0: So the stalls are shaped kind of weird, so I have not yet gone into the stall I'm going into.

166
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,779
Speaker 0: So I'm standing outside of it, about to open the door and get into it.

167
00:07:06,623 --> 00:07:10,040
Speaker 0: And I'm standing next to the side of the other stall.

168
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,699
Speaker 0: So I'm standing there, and suddenly all this water splashes on my shoe, like a ton of it.

169
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,480
Speaker 0: And I thought, did water just fall from the ceiling?

170
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,760
Speaker 0: And I look up, and there's no way water could have fallen from the ceiling.

171
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:30,760
Speaker 0: Then I realized that the old man had started peeing and had that thing happen where you just fucking missed the toilet.

172
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,539
Speaker 0: For the first, like, I don't know.

173
00:07:34,123 --> 00:07:37,060
Speaker 1: So the pee came out from underneath the edge of the stall wall?

174
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:42,700
Speaker 0: Like the line went under the stall wall, didn't hit the stall wall, went under it at the perfect angle, and just hit my shoe.

175
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,980
Speaker 1: So your shoe was pretty close to the stall wall, on your side.

176
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:46,720
Speaker 0: I was like seven inches away.

177
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,080
Speaker 1: So his pee crossed the wall.

178
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,180
Speaker 0: Yes, it was a cup, like this wine glass worth of pee, like boosh, all at once.

179
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,137
Speaker 1: That's a lot of pee.

180
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,819
Speaker 0: The guy just kind of keeps peeing, and...

181
00:07:56,082 --> 00:07:56,899
Speaker 1: He adjusted his aim?

182
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I just kind of stood there, like, did this dude just fucking pee on my shoe?

183
00:08:02,643 --> 00:08:03,498
Speaker 1: What did you do about it?

184
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,580
Speaker 0: So, I just kind of stood there, and I didn't say anything.

185
00:08:07,121 --> 00:08:08,839
Speaker 0: I was waiting to see if he said anything.

186
00:08:09,442 --> 00:08:10,219
Speaker 0: What was I going to say?

187
00:08:10,921 --> 00:08:12,219
Speaker 1: You peed on my fucking shoe?

188
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:14,420
Speaker 1: Buy me a new shoe, asshole.

189
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,080
Speaker 0: Well, luckily the shoe was waterproof.

190
00:08:17,703 --> 00:08:19,278
Speaker 1: It's not pee-proof, it's still smell, man.

191
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,459
Speaker 0: I get the impression the guy was senile.

192
00:08:22,621 --> 00:08:23,549
Speaker 1: Then why was he doing?

193
00:08:23,609 --> 00:08:24,820
Speaker 1: in your fancy work building?

194
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,400
Speaker 0: There's like four other offices on my floor.

195
00:08:28,983 --> 00:08:31,160
Speaker 1: Is it these senile old people taking care of place?

196
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:37,480
Speaker 0: It's like four lawyers, and then one mental health care facility, but the old man was... I think the old man is one of the lawyers that works in the building.

197
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,639
Speaker 1: Then he can afford to buy you a shoe.

198
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:40,793
Speaker 1: Or two.

199
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:49,135
Speaker 0: So, I rinsed my shoe off, and I went back into the office, and I walk in, and I'm like, "An older gentleman just fucking peed on my shoe,".

200
00:08:49,175 --> 00:08:49,779
Speaker 0: and everyone's like, "What?

201
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:50,363
Speaker 0: On the

202
00:08:50,403 --> 00:08:50,848
Speaker 0: subway?".

203
00:08:52,662 --> 00:08:53,219
Speaker 0: Where's the shoe?

204
00:08:53,341 --> 00:08:54,359
Speaker 1: I got to stay away from it.

205
00:08:56,783 --> 00:08:58,560
Speaker 0: I was just so surprised.

206
00:08:58,701 --> 00:09:01,540
Speaker 0: Mostly, it's like that time I spit that water all over you.

207
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,557
Speaker 0: Like, what do you do?

208
00:09:03,101 --> 00:09:03,958
Speaker 0: You just stand there.

209
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,059
Speaker 0: You don't say anything.

210
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,500
Speaker 0: You didn't say anything when I did that.

211
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,759
Speaker 0: You just stood there looking at me.

212
00:09:08,121 --> 00:09:09,019
Speaker 1: Did you pee on my shoe?

213
00:09:09,221 --> 00:09:10,980
Speaker 0: No, I spit water all over you.

214
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,360
Speaker 1: That was a different situation.

215
00:09:12,461 --> 00:09:13,500
Speaker 1: That was a lot of water, though.

216
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,618
Speaker 1: That was an intentional, hilarious situation.

217
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,180
Speaker 1: Not a guy peed on my shoe situation.

218
00:09:21,805 --> 00:09:22,460
Speaker 0: So, it's Thursday.

219
00:09:22,641 --> 00:09:23,199
Speaker 0: It's the lounge.

220
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,019
Speaker 0: You got anything to talk about in the lounge?

221
00:09:25,624 --> 00:09:30,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it's like... It's, you know, the lounge for this week is Scandals.

222
00:09:33,023 --> 00:09:35,019
Speaker 0: You know, I've never set foot in there, and I really don't plan to.

223
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,120
Speaker 1: Google Latitude says otherwise.

224
00:09:37,761 --> 00:09:38,278
Speaker 0: Poor George.

225
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,400
Speaker 0: He keeps recommending, because he comes here all the time.

226
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,740
Speaker 0: It's like, "Hey, were you just at Scandals?

227
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,260
Speaker 0: Do you want to go to Scandals?

228
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,048
Speaker 0: Hey, only two hours to

229
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:46,732
Speaker 0: Scandals.".

230
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:55,058
Speaker 0: Though I did learn recently in Latitude, you can backtrack and retroactively check into places.

231
00:09:55,742 --> 00:10:01,160
Speaker 0: Like, if you didn't check in, like, you go through your history on the website, it'll be like, "Hey, on this day, here's all the places we think you were.

232
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,716
Speaker 0: Check the ones you were, and we'll add it to your

233
00:10:02,756 --> 00:10:03,080
Speaker 0: timeline.".

234
00:10:03,781 --> 00:10:07,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, my inferior iOS Latitude app does not do that.

235
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,200
Speaker 0: But that's the website.

236
00:10:09,382 --> 00:10:10,460
Speaker 0: That's not anything in the app.

237
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,500
Speaker 1: But, I mean, the data just doesn't make it to the website a lot of the time.

238
00:10:13,641 --> 00:10:13,768
Speaker 1: Wow.

239
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:14,762
Speaker 1: So...

240
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:18,139
Speaker 0: I mean, I can generate, like, heat maps of everywhere I've been.

241
00:10:18,721 --> 00:10:20,639
Speaker 0: Oh, look, our friend Chie is in New Zealand right now.

242
00:10:20,903 --> 00:10:21,379
Speaker 1: We know that.

243
00:10:21,501 --> 00:10:22,999
Speaker 0: Let me zoom in to exactly where she is.

244
00:10:23,383 --> 00:10:25,079
Speaker 0: She's in Invercargill.

245
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,097
Speaker 1: Oh, my God, that's the greatest name.

246
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:27,680
Speaker 0: Invercargill.

247
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,079
Speaker 0: She's on... What street is she on?

248
00:10:29,641 --> 00:10:30,920
Speaker 0: She's on Alice Street.

249
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:36,456
Speaker 0: I think she's at the Waihopai School right now, which is next to the Southland Boys High School.

250
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:36,964
Speaker 1: Ooh.

251
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:37,690
Speaker 1: What am I gonna?

252
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,140
Speaker 1: street view?

253
00:10:38,321 --> 00:10:39,497
Speaker 1: She's picking up high school boys.

254
00:10:40,184 --> 00:10:44,320
Speaker 0: How can I get... Ah, there's no street view in Invercargill in Australia.

255
00:10:44,465 --> 00:10:44,818
Speaker 1: I wonder why.

256
00:10:44,881 --> 00:10:45,579
Speaker 1: Or in New Zealand.

257
00:10:45,761 --> 00:10:46,317
Speaker 1: I wonder why.

258
00:10:46,721 --> 00:10:49,560
Speaker 0: It's near the Winton-Lourneville Hoei.

259
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,780
Speaker 1: There's a giant park outside.

260
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,740
Speaker 0: It's not that big.

261
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,579
Speaker 0: It's the Queen's Park.

262
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:53,356
Speaker 0: Yeah.

263
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,880
Speaker 0: I wonder if it's the Queen apostrophe.

264
00:10:55,825 --> 00:10:56,520
Speaker 0: Oh, it's near an airport.

265
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,900
Speaker 1: Is it Queen's Park with an apostrophe or not?

266
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,519
Speaker 0: There's no apostrophe.

267
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,900
Speaker 1: Oh, so it means it's the park of many queens and not just possessed by a single queen.

268
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,640
Speaker 0: Perhaps, unless the mark was simply lost.

269
00:11:12,203 --> 00:11:13,537
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah, it's been a...

270
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,399
Speaker 0: We don't have anything?

271
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,200
Speaker 0: You haven't done anything?

272
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,959
Speaker 0: Nothing's going on?

273
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,199
Speaker 1: Week of Netrunner, I guess.

274
00:11:18,003 --> 00:11:19,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, we already talked about Netrunner.

275
00:11:19,222 --> 00:11:19,476
Speaker 1: I know.

276
00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:21,020
Speaker 0: I don't think I need to talk about it again.

277
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,379
Speaker 1: That's pretty much all that's going on is Netrunner and NS2.

278
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,598
Speaker 1: Those are my things right now.

279
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:34,356
Speaker 0: Oh, one thing I did do recently is I have a backlog of like 5,000 pictures I've taken that I just haven't uploaded to Flickr or anything because it takes a while to actually go through and sort them all.

280
00:11:35,242 --> 00:11:36,680
Speaker 0: So I finally started doing that.

281
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,580
Speaker 0: So I started uploading my Flickr again and you know what, Flickr's getting better.

282
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,660
Speaker 0: Like they're adding little features and changing stuff.

283
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:50,198
Speaker 1: I uploaded all the stuff that I didn't over the past few months and during my sick day and it's pretty much the same as it was.

284
00:11:51,321 --> 00:11:54,159
Speaker 1: Uh, you know, the only thing it really updated is the iOS app.

285
00:11:54,941 --> 00:11:58,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Android app updated substantially and I'm setting up some stuff in there.

286
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the website is still pretty much the same UI.

287
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,440
Speaker 0: No, the organizing of sets and things, they added some more layers and stuff around that.

288
00:12:05,704 --> 00:12:06,479
Speaker 1: Not that I saw.

289
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,959
Speaker 1: The organizer was pretty much the same as it was.

290
00:12:09,181 --> 00:12:09,780
Speaker 0: It looked different.

291
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,440
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter because I don't use any of that.

292
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,640
Speaker 0: I do it all in Lightroom anyway.

293
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,579
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know, right?

294
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,300
Speaker 1: But it's, you know, looks pretty much the same.

295
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:19,819
Speaker 0: So I guess I got a lounge news.

296
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,540
Speaker 0: I don't know where you all stand.

297
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,339
Speaker 0: I wanted to do a show on gun control, but Scott was like, hey, I don't want to talk about it.

298
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,739
Speaker 1: Don't give a shit about this bullshit.

299
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,958
Speaker 0: And Scott suggested we do a show on poop, which I was down with, but then he refused to do it.

300
00:12:32,421 --> 00:12:37,340
Speaker 1: That was a suggestion just to be for argumentative purpose, not a legitimate suggestion.

301
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:44,699
Speaker 0: See, the problem with making the disingenuous, uh, uh, suggestion is that I am perfectly willing to go down that road.

302
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:44,965
Speaker 0: Yeah.

303
00:12:45,421 --> 00:12:46,480
Speaker 1: I don't actually go down that road.

304
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,560
Speaker 0: It's like if someone tries to be passive aggressive with me, someone's like, ah, alright, I guess we can go to Applebee's.

305
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,760
Speaker 0: I'll be like, we're going to fucking Applebee's.

306
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:59,480
Speaker 1: I'll just set up that road, point it out as a, you know, sort of Pajamkin's village.

307
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:02,539
Speaker 1: The problem is, you know, actually going to go live there.

308
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,639
Speaker 0: Thing is, I know what Pajamkin's village is.

309
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,060
Speaker 0: Also, I think a poop show would be pretty funny.

310
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,200
Speaker 0: So I was totally willing to do it.

311
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,920
Speaker 1: A poop show is a Pajamkin's village of a show.

312
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,060
Speaker 0: I wanted to do a show on Texas.

313
00:13:12,563 --> 00:13:13,440
Speaker 1: We did one already.

314
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:13,633
Speaker 0: Yeah.

315
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,341
Speaker 0: In like 2007.

316
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:16,698
Speaker 1: And we only talked about taxes in the US.

317
00:13:16,861 --> 00:13:17,479
Speaker 1: Has tax law changed that much?

318
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:17,935
Speaker 1: Yes.

319
00:13:18,762 --> 00:13:19,740
Speaker 0: Yes, it has actually.

320
00:13:19,902 --> 00:13:19,988
Speaker 0: Also.

321
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:22,000
Speaker 1: Are you an expert on those changes?

322
00:13:22,521 --> 00:13:26,780
Speaker 0: Uh, in the sense that actually a lot of tax stuff is way different from me now.

323
00:13:26,924 --> 00:13:27,120
Speaker 1: All right.

324
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:31,680
Speaker 1: I'll tell you, I'll discuss one thing about taxes that I learned at work today.

325
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,920
Speaker 1: A coworker remarked to me that they had not filed in three years.

326
00:13:36,181 --> 00:13:41,419
Speaker 1: I was under the assumption that if you fail to file, you go to federal pound me in the ass prison.

327
00:13:41,581 --> 00:13:45,998
Speaker 0: No, it takes about three years for them to notice that you didn't file a pretty simple process.

328
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:46,858
Speaker 0: I went through all this.

329
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:56,710
Speaker 1: So when they lost my 2009 tax return, apparently what happens when you don't file is if they owe you money, you just don't get it back to.

330
00:13:57,312 --> 00:14:03,780
Speaker 0: if you owe them money, they eventually after a long ass time, figure out what you should have owed and send you a bill.

331
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,537
Speaker 1: They figure out what you should have and send you a bill plus 10% interest.

332
00:14:08,744 --> 00:14:10,242
Speaker 0: It can be more than 10%.

333
00:14:10,242 --> 00:14:11,639
Speaker 1: I'm saying a lot of interest.

334
00:14:12,021 --> 00:14:12,479
Speaker 0: So let me know.

335
00:14:12,823 --> 00:14:13,999
Speaker 0: So that happened to me.

336
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,420
Speaker 0: Now I didn't.

337
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,359
Speaker 1: This is news to me.

338
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,140
Speaker 1: Why have I been so fucking responsible?

339
00:14:18,484 --> 00:14:19,540
Speaker 0: Because you don't want to pay that.

340
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:19,700
Speaker 0: If

341
00:14:19,801 --> 00:14:33,459
Speaker 1: I ever start a business, I'm basically just going to ignore taxes until I'm making mad money and then pay all the back taxes plus interest because if my business exceeds it, you succeed enough to pay that and if the business fails, well, I just never wasted my money on paying taxes.

342
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:33,940
Speaker 1: What do you do?

343
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,526
Speaker 1: Come and get me my $0.

344
00:14:35,526 --> 00:14:45,312
Speaker 0: remember about a year ago when I got a tax bill out of nowhere from New York state claiming I owed them like 10 grand and I ended up owing them, we talked about, I ended up owing him negative $20 after all that.

345
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,379
Speaker 0: So it was okay.

346
00:14:48,102 --> 00:14:51,020
Speaker 0: But I was, I thought we could do a show about taxes, you know, just change.

347
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,039
Speaker 0: It's been six years.

348
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,300
Speaker 1: You already talked about that story.

349
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:55,620
Speaker 1: And we talked about the taxes on that episode.

350
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:56,500
Speaker 0: I got a lot to say about taxes.

351
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:03,919
Speaker 0: I was going to talk about civic structures and my feelings on like the legitimacy of taxes, how I would like to change tax code, all that stuff down.

352
00:15:04,462 --> 00:15:05,420
Speaker 1: We're done with taxes.

353
00:15:06,046 --> 00:15:07,420
Speaker 0: I have plenty to say on taxes.

354
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,179
Speaker 1: You can do your own podcast lately.

355
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:14,020
Speaker 0: I've been doing this a lot on the show because every time I do it, you listeners always seem to agree with me.

356
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,360
Speaker 0: So I'm asking you again, would you like to hear us do a new show on taxes?

357
00:15:19,421 --> 00:15:23,637
Speaker 1: They're always going to say yes to anything you say or do you want to say anything?

358
00:15:23,758 --> 00:15:26,739
Speaker 0: I say it's got, what was your idea, but I had no idea.

359
00:15:28,182 --> 00:15:29,615
Speaker 0: So I do have one non idea.

360
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,458
Speaker 1: They'd say yes to that too.

361
00:15:31,741 --> 00:15:38,360
Speaker 0: Since we're not going to talk about gun control, even though I got a complicated opinion on that, as always, I do want to bring up one thing because it's the lounge.

362
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,278
Speaker 0: I can bring up one thing.

363
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:44,220
Speaker 0: The thing I want to bring up is that it doesn't, I don't care where you stand on the gun control debate.

364
00:15:44,602 --> 00:15:46,820
Speaker 0: There's a reasonable debate to be had in all directions.

365
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,714
Speaker 0: I don't want to get into that.

366
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,339
Speaker 1: But you wanted to have an episode on it.

367
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:50,540
Speaker 1: Yeah.

368
00:15:51,262 --> 00:16:06,079
Speaker 0: I don't want to get into it right now, but you can make intelligent arguments on many sides of the gun control debate, however, independent of all of that, the NRA is fucking crazy.

369
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,860
Speaker 0: And if you're a member of the NRA, you should quit.

370
00:16:08,922 --> 00:16:09,095
Speaker 0: Okay.

371
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:10,759
Speaker 1: So why are you bringing this up?

372
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:15,437
Speaker 1: Even though it has been true since 19 what year, what year, what now?

373
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:17,518
Speaker 0: The NRA was fine back then.

374
00:16:18,004 --> 00:16:19,480
Speaker 1: It was never not crazy.

375
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,128
Speaker 0: No, actually it's only in the last couple of decades that the NRA has actually gotten weird.

376
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:32,340
Speaker 0: This is not news, nor is it excite, nor is it, you know, all right guys, tell us, would you like to hear my opinions on gun control?

377
00:16:32,883 --> 00:16:34,320
Speaker 0: Would you like us to talk about this?

378
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,906
Speaker 1: Would you like me to talk about X?

379
00:16:35,967 --> 00:16:38,738
Speaker 1: insert anything X and the answer will always be yes.

380
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,671
Speaker 0: Apparently they don't want us to talk about the great Gatsby.

381
00:16:41,832 --> 00:16:43,959
Speaker 1: if they are, no, they do want to hear it.

382
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,617
Speaker 1: They just don't agree.

383
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:45,399
Speaker 1: Right.

384
00:16:46,081 --> 00:17:00,777
Speaker 1: If the people are spending time out of their day to listen to this fricking show, they want to hear us say anything, no matter what it is, we could sit here and say the, the, the, the, the, for 20, but someone is going to listen to it like Hypnotoad and they'll be fooled at least once and they'll like it.

385
00:17:06,821 --> 00:17:10,619
Speaker 0: So anyway, things of the day, what do you got for me, Scott?

386
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:14,839
Speaker 1: I'm not sure if this is a improv everywhere.

387
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,720
Speaker 1: I mean, it's kind of thing that they would do, but it's posted not on their YouTube account.

388
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,560
Speaker 1: It's posted on a panhandler party, YouTube account.

389
00:17:21,922 --> 00:17:24,359
Speaker 1: And of course the video is panhandler party.

390
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:26,878
Speaker 1: I think it's a YouTube account that was made just for this video.

391
00:17:27,902 --> 00:17:31,740
Speaker 1: And what it is, the New York city subway and a panhandler comes on pretty typical.

392
00:17:32,242 --> 00:17:38,379
Speaker 1: And then another one and then another one, it's this comedy sketch where a whole bunch of panhandlers all get on the same subway car at the same time.

393
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:42,799
Speaker 1: If you're a New York person, you can appreciate this video a lot.

394
00:17:43,341 --> 00:17:46,932
Speaker 1: So if you're not a New York person, it might still be funny, but you will appreciate it less.

395
00:17:47,241 --> 00:17:50,340
Speaker 0: Oh, that reminds me of something I was going to use this thing of the day a long time ago.

396
00:17:50,581 --> 00:17:51,480
Speaker 0: I'll save it for another time.

397
00:17:51,540 --> 00:18:01,600
Speaker 0: But basically it was this girl telling a hyperbole and a half style, uh, like blog image thing of her attempt to get home to Brooklyn.

398
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,480
Speaker 1: That was the thing of the day that I used on the thing of the day.

399
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,220
Speaker 1: It was the thing of the day, that's how you found out about it.

400
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,245
Speaker 0: I'll make it a thing of the day and see.

401
00:18:07,265 --> 00:18:10,714
Speaker 0: if anyone notices like a year from now, I'll just do it.

402
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,180
Speaker 1: Why do you keep reusing it?

403
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,278
Speaker 1: We might as well just take an old geek nights episode, post it and change just the beginning part.

404
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,360
Speaker 0: No, I want to redo old geek nights episodes.

405
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:23,999
Speaker 1: I mean, we should just take an old episode, change the date at the beginning of the audio file and repost that audio file.

406
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,680
Speaker 0: I want to do episodes again without listening to the old ones and see if we have different opinions now.

407
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,819
Speaker 1: You just want to avoid the only part of the show that is hard work, which is coming up with a show idea.

408
00:18:34,187 --> 00:18:34,820
Speaker 0: I just think it would be fun.

409
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:44,979
Speaker 0: I'd love to listen to like myself talk about, you like to listen to yourself talk, you say talk about something and then talk about the same thing from like seven or eight years ago in my life.

410
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:45,500
Speaker 1: That'd be cool.

411
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:46,818
Speaker 1: I do not want to do this.

412
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,960
Speaker 0: I mean, I read like, remember those articles I used to write for Gracie's dinner time theater.

413
00:18:51,521 --> 00:18:56,040
Speaker 0: So I read those again and it's interesting reading those from my 10 year later perspective.

414
00:18:57,562 --> 00:19:00,279
Speaker 0: So anyway, I have a related thematic thing of the day.

415
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:06,037
Speaker 0: Bill Cosby, funny man, I think his funniest routine ever is still to Russell, my brother whom I slept with.

416
00:19:06,581 --> 00:19:13,520
Speaker 1: I like the one where he says and the chicken out of New York City, my favorite one of his, I don't know what the name of it is, but it's the one where he's like tread water.

417
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,119
Speaker 1: No parents don't want justice.

418
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:15,777
Speaker 1: You want quiet.

419
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:22,660
Speaker 1: And it's like, cause that is the number one thing when I, when I was a kid is I'm a kid, I wanted justice.

420
00:19:22,781 --> 00:19:23,479
Speaker 1: I saw justice.

421
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,840
Speaker 1: I was taught justice everywhere.

422
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,918
Speaker 1: People would teach you about the justice system and fairness, but then they wouldn't just expense it.

423
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,137
Speaker 1: And I'd be like, fuck you.

424
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:44,320
Speaker 0: So relevant to this bill Cosby did a bit a long time ago, which is still relevant to this day, except it's no longer 15 cents, but the New York city subway is pretty special.

425
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,537
Speaker 0: There is a nut in every car.

426
00:19:47,162 --> 00:19:48,959
Speaker 1: It's like multiple nuts in every car.

427
00:19:51,283 --> 00:19:58,859
Speaker 0: So last time Emily and I went skiing, like the previous time, not this most recent time, we get up, you know, butt ass early in the morning to get on a subway to go to times square.

428
00:19:59,762 --> 00:20:01,600
Speaker 0: And it's right around the hoboing hour.

429
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,460
Speaker 0: Like when the hobos are all going to wherever they go at the end of the night, you know, three, four or five in the morning.

430
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:11,300
Speaker 0: So we get on a car and it's vomited poop, the hobo.

431
00:20:11,704 --> 00:20:12,759
Speaker 1: So how'd you get a different car?

432
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:12,995
Speaker 0: No.

433
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,340
Speaker 0: So the door opens, we are about to step in and we see it's the empty car.

434
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:21,159
Speaker 0: There's one hobo laying on the ground, passed out, covered in poop and vomit, getting a different car.

435
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,480
Speaker 0: We go root into another car just before the doors closed.

436
00:20:23,661 --> 00:20:23,936
Speaker 0: Same deal.

437
00:20:24,622 --> 00:20:24,875
Speaker 0: Yes.

438
00:20:25,442 --> 00:20:27,040
Speaker 1: Two adjacent hobo cars.

439
00:20:27,181 --> 00:20:28,779
Speaker 0: I think it was the hobo commuter hour.

440
00:20:30,163 --> 00:20:31,539
Speaker 0: That was the danger zone.

441
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,620
Speaker 1: But did you get from a bad one to a worse one or the worst one to a slight thing?

442
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,659
Speaker 0: I didn't want to risk it.

443
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,700
Speaker 0: It's like Russian roulette.

444
00:20:38,101 --> 00:20:39,114
Speaker 0: And the problem was now...

445
00:20:39,682 --> 00:20:41,240
Speaker 1: No, Russian roulette, there's only one bullet.

446
00:20:41,842 --> 00:20:43,200
Speaker 1: This is the opposite of Russian roulette.

447
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,392
Speaker 1: This is five bullets, only one.

448
00:20:45,513 --> 00:20:46,820
Speaker 1: safe empty chamber.

449
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:47,840
Speaker 0: Hard mode.

450
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,640
Speaker 0: Hard mode.

451
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:51,760
Speaker 1: Russian roulette and hard mode, bullet in every chamber.

452
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,300
Speaker 0: Well, I guess, no, that's all but one.

453
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,380
Speaker 0: Expert mode, it's a semi-automatic.

454
00:20:56,241 --> 00:20:58,780
Speaker 1: Expert mode, it's an automatic, you have to hold it down for a second.

455
00:21:01,444 --> 00:21:03,079
Speaker 1: So... A full one Mississippi.

456
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,019
Speaker 1: Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

457
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:09,000
Speaker 0: So in a moment, Geek Nights is going to be at the Penny Arcade Expo East doing not one but two panels.

458
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,759
Speaker 0: We are doing both on Saturday currently.

459
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:17,980
Speaker 0: We are going to be doing practical game theory and mastering game mechanics to brand new lectures.

460
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,739
Speaker 1: Oh snap, we should do something about that.

461
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, I gotta write those things.

462
00:21:22,705 --> 00:21:24,260
Speaker 0: I got a bunch of videos up from MagFest.

463
00:21:25,822 --> 00:21:27,900
Speaker 0: We were on two panels and we presented a lecture.

464
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:28,619
Speaker 0: Two of those are up.

465
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,939
Speaker 0: The third one is going to be up shortly.

466
00:21:30,861 --> 00:21:31,940
Speaker 0: We are going to be at Kineticon.

467
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:35,900
Speaker 0: It's a ways out but I only bring it up because panel submissions are open, y'alls.

468
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:48,739
Speaker 0: Submit your lectures, your panels, your events because me and Scott and one other person, a third person we've added to our head staff, the directors, the directorates, we're the ones who decide what panels get scheduled.

469
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:56,917
Speaker 0: So if you submit, I don't know, like precursor technology in science fiction, I'm probably going to accept it.

470
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,880
Speaker 0: If you submit Homestuck Jeopardy, probably not going to accept it.

471
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:07,769
Speaker 1: If you submit my rant about this one thing that bothers me, probably not going to accept that.

472
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:13,958
Speaker 0: But if you're, for example, James Portnow and you submit his rant about video game genres, I'm going to accept that.

473
00:22:15,061 --> 00:22:17,676
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that's in 56, well PAX East is in 56 days.

474
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, we got to get on that.

475
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,499
Speaker 1: Clock is ticking.

476
00:22:23,761 --> 00:22:30,540
Speaker 0: And the book club book is The Great Gatsby which apparently is controversial even though it's really short and easy to read.

477
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:44,459
Speaker 0: Alright you punk kids, I swear to God, I am so sure that you alone, of all people in the last hundred years, have figured out what's wrong with this book that for almost a hundred years people have been talking about.

478
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:53,080
Speaker 1: And is super famous and is considered the great American novel and is taught in many schools and is hailed by many experts and academics.

479
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,120
Speaker 0: To make a side point, because I could make a lot of funny points about this.

480
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,859
Speaker 1: I'm sure that you, some punk kid on the internet who was very young, knows better than all those people.

481
00:23:02,021 --> 00:23:06,619
Speaker 0: It's like on Slashshot, there's an article, Slashshot will have an article like check out this new kind of subway train.

482
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:17,200
Speaker 0: And there's all the posts that are like, but what if the train crashes, but what if the air is just like, yes, really Slashshot dude, I'm sure you thought of this.

483
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,260
Speaker 0: You thought of the obvious problem.

484
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:25,719
Speaker 0: Like what if it falls off the tracks that no engineer for the past 20 years of design and development even considered.

485
00:23:26,241 --> 00:23:38,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, these guys, their only job in the world is to make trains, they are train experts, but you random guy in Slashshot who does something else for a job or possibly has no job.

486
00:23:39,263 --> 00:23:42,540
Speaker 1: You read one article and you know more than all these train engineers.

487
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:51,620
Speaker 0: You have clearly figured out why our carrier fleet and our naval strategy is so flawed and can be taken out trivially by North Korea.

488
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,613
Speaker 0: Clearly you know better than him.

489
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,820
Speaker 0: So I'm not making that argument right now.

490
00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:00,140
Speaker 1: I'm sure the top, the chief admiral of the entire Navy is on Slashshot.

491
00:24:00,445 --> 00:24:00,720
Speaker 1: That's why.

492
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:17,968
Speaker 0: So kids, if you're evaluating the quality and relevance of a piece of literature, you cannot judge it by whether or not you agree with the point it is making or can understand or relate to the perspective it is putting

493
00:24:18,048 --> 00:24:21,975
Speaker 1: forth or whether you find it personally entertaining to you.

494
00:24:22,965 --> 00:24:24,100
Speaker 0: I guess people are confusing.

495
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:31,780
Speaker 0: For example, hunger games, a lot of people didn't like hunger games because they didn't like reading the main characters thoughts.

496
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:39,460
Speaker 0: You don't have to like it, but those main character thoughts were a pretty good representation of what like a 14 year old girl thinks like as far as I can tell.

497
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,540
Speaker 1: Not many people want to read what a 14 year old girl's thinking about.

498
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,700
Speaker 0: But a lot of people, they're complaining about the Great Gatsby.

499
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,779
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, all these people are vapid and stupid and they're making bad decisions.

500
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:50,879
Speaker 1: Isn't that a point?

501
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,400
Speaker 0: And then they're like, but that story has been told a million times.

502
00:24:54,541 --> 00:24:55,560
Speaker 0: Why is this book special?

503
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:56,436
Speaker 0: You know what?

504
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:57,838
Speaker 0: No.

505
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,120
Speaker 0: You guys weren't really complaining too much about the Kingkiller Chronicle.

506
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,458
Speaker 1: Don't spill the load on this episode now.

507
00:25:03,844 --> 00:25:03,933
Speaker 1: Yeah.

508
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:10,340
Speaker 0: Because I don't want to make the Great Gatsby show be about the punk kids who are just bringing out the haterade.

509
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:17,980
Speaker 1: Well, my favorite, my favorite video to explain this phenomenon, right, is if you go to YouTube and your search for why is the Mona Lisa, why so famous?

510
00:25:18,801 --> 00:25:23,620
Speaker 1: It has almost a million views and explains to you why the Mona Lisa is so famous.

511
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:23,768
Speaker 1: Right.

512
00:25:24,061 --> 00:25:25,900
Speaker 1: So now tell me, if you look at the Mona Lisa, right?

513
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,180
Speaker 0: I mean, it's a painting of a girl.

514
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,760
Speaker 1: It's not bad looking, but it's not like I want to put it on my wall.

515
00:25:30,861 --> 00:25:32,419
Speaker 1: It's not like I'm making my desktop wallpaper.

516
00:25:32,601 --> 00:25:34,100
Speaker 1: It's not like I like it so much.

517
00:25:34,268 --> 00:25:34,439
Speaker 1: Right.

518
00:25:34,961 --> 00:25:36,580
Speaker 1: But I'm not going to go on saying it sucks.

519
00:25:37,061 --> 00:25:41,420
Speaker 1: And you watch this video, it explains to you why it's so fucking famous.

520
00:25:41,701 --> 00:25:43,126
Speaker 1: So you can just apply this

521
00:25:43,568 --> 00:25:43,909
Speaker 0: to

522
00:25:44,391 --> 00:26:01,376
Speaker 1: every other classic work in every medium of art that you don't understand or like and assume there are reasons along the lines of these same reasons that those things are so famous and hailed by academics and you just are not educated enough to know them or you just don't know them yet and you need a YouTube video to explain them to you.

523
00:26:01,741 --> 00:26:07,380
Speaker 1: So assume Great Gatsby has those things because you know, it's a classic, you know, it's super famous.

524
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,819
Speaker 1: Therefore, it must have things of this nature making it so.

525
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:16,700
Speaker 0: And it does like I do with the anime kids like, yeah, you all say Evangelion is so overrated and so stupid.

526
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,920
Speaker 1: You don't have to like it, but it has things like this.

527
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,460
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's why Evangelion?

528
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,138
Speaker 1: Why so famous?

529
00:26:23,523 --> 00:26:23,617
Speaker 0: Sure.

530
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,579
Speaker 0: It's super overrated.

531
00:26:24,721 --> 00:26:25,557
Speaker 0: Let's say I agree with you.

532
00:26:26,202 --> 00:26:26,644
Speaker 0: How come?

533
00:26:26,946 --> 00:26:29,519
Speaker 0: not only are we talking about it, but you're talking about it.

534
00:26:29,782 --> 00:26:30,680
Speaker 1: Why are you talking?

535
00:26:30,761 --> 00:26:33,298
Speaker 1: And it's how many years old and you're still talking about it?

536
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:33,940
Speaker 0: Yeah.

537
00:26:34,321 --> 00:26:35,100
Speaker 1: Talking about love.

538
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,279
Speaker 0: Hina was talking about it.

539
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:37,217
Speaker 0: Toussaint.

540
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:37,697
Speaker 1: Right.

541
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:38,839
Speaker 0: No time.

542
00:26:39,992 --> 00:26:40,160
Speaker 1: Great.

543
00:26:40,341 --> 00:26:40,999
Speaker 1: Digital target.

544
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:41,719
Speaker 0: Yeah.

545
00:26:42,161 --> 00:26:42,539
Speaker 1: Nobody.

546
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,179
Speaker 1: Nobody's talking about it.

547
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,319
Speaker 0: Maybe Darryl Surratt.

548
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:46,480
Speaker 1: Barely.

549
00:26:47,001 --> 00:26:48,900
Speaker 1: I don't even think he talks of a great digital target.

550
00:26:49,027 --> 00:26:49,112
Speaker 1: Yeah.

551
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,479
Speaker 0: So anyway, the book club book is The Great Gatsby.

552
00:26:51,721 --> 00:26:53,699
Speaker 1: Read it in or be a plebe.

553
00:26:54,021 --> 00:26:56,259
Speaker 0: I think most of you didn't read it because or didn't like it.

554
00:26:56,862 --> 00:26:59,280
Speaker 0: So short because you had to read it in high school.

555
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,199
Speaker 1: I didn't have to read it in high school because I never read it.

556
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:04,580
Speaker 1: It took me like a couple hours.

557
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,457
Speaker 1: It's so short.

558
00:27:06,242 --> 00:27:07,779
Speaker 0: Anyway, you can play the game now.

559
00:27:08,644 --> 00:27:09,679
Speaker 1: I played the game a little bit.

560
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:09,849
Speaker 1: Yeah.

561
00:27:10,325 --> 00:27:10,574
Speaker 1: It's OK.

562
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:10,889
Speaker 1: It's OK.

563
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:11,367
Speaker 1: Yeah.

564
00:27:12,303 --> 00:27:13,398
Speaker 0: It's actually a pretty good platformer.

565
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:13,626
Speaker 1: Yeah.

566
00:27:14,743 --> 00:27:15,057
Speaker 1: Anyway.

567
00:27:15,681 --> 00:27:17,498
Speaker 0: So this was Scott's idea for a show.

568
00:27:18,062 --> 00:27:20,279
Speaker 1: It was not my idea in the forum.

569
00:27:20,721 --> 00:27:24,738
Speaker 1: I went to the show ideas thread and I kept going back until I found an idea.

570
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:25,938
Speaker 1: that was a Thursday idea.

571
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:30,220
Speaker 0: And so this is possibly the most succinct suggestion we've ever had a post in there.

572
00:27:30,321 --> 00:27:31,672
Speaker 1: And the post said one word parks.

573
00:27:33,001 --> 00:27:40,219
Speaker 1: Now that could be taken as like public parks or playgrounds or, you know, the word park means many things.

574
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,679
Speaker 1: Parking parkour.

575
00:27:41,781 --> 00:27:42,280
Speaker 1: Right.

576
00:27:42,701 --> 00:27:44,759
Speaker 1: So I figure we should have park week.

577
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:52,780
Speaker 1: We could do parks, parking parkour as parker brothers, parking someone named Parkington.

578
00:27:52,841 --> 00:27:53,434
Speaker 1: that I don't know.

579
00:27:54,646 --> 00:27:55,440
Speaker 1: Just go on Wikipedia.

580
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,658
Speaker 0: I guess we're really we could talk about cool hand Luke.

581
00:27:58,624 --> 00:27:59,519
Speaker 1: What does that have to do with parks?

582
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,698
Speaker 0: Why was he in jail?

583
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,419
Speaker 1: He was a thief.

584
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:04,017
Speaker 1: He was.

585
00:28:04,281 --> 00:28:04,834
Speaker 0: What do you do?

586
00:28:05,981 --> 00:28:07,039
Speaker 1: That's why he was cool hand Luke.

587
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:07,306
Speaker 1: No.

588
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,249
Speaker 1: What did he do?

589
00:28:10,504 --> 00:28:11,019
Speaker 0: You don't remember.

590
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:11,289
Speaker 0: Do you?

591
00:28:12,262 --> 00:28:15,440
Speaker 1: I just thought he stole because the beginning of the movie isn't bringing him into the jail.

592
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:15,827
Speaker 1: No.

593
00:28:16,589 --> 00:28:16,720
Speaker 1: Yeah.

594
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:25,137
Speaker 1: The first scene I remember from the movie is like one of those behind the guy feet shots as he's walking in the he's handcuffed and the guy's walking him over to the to the.

595
00:28:25,157 --> 00:28:25,967
Speaker 1: the jail.

596
00:28:26,381 --> 00:28:27,820
Speaker 1: The well, the labor camp.

597
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,559
Speaker 1: It's not a jail.

598
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:28,871
Speaker 1: Jail.

599
00:28:29,726 --> 00:28:30,560
Speaker 0: Well, it's a jail.

600
00:28:30,741 --> 00:28:31,860
Speaker 0: It's just also a labor camp.

601
00:28:32,681 --> 00:28:33,439
Speaker 1: And imprisoning.

602
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,438
Speaker 0: I have quotes.

603
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:41,060
Speaker 0: Lucas Jackson, played by Paul Newman, is arrested for cutting the heads off of a small town's parking meters.

604
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,059
Speaker 0: One drunken night.

605
00:28:43,161 --> 00:28:50,280
Speaker 0: You don't remember that scene where he's laughing and walking around with that like pipe cutter just cutting all the heads of the parking meters off and laughing the whole time vaguely.

606
00:28:51,005 --> 00:28:51,219
Speaker 0: That's.

607
00:28:51,704 --> 00:28:51,960
Speaker 0: Yeah.

608
00:28:52,801 --> 00:28:52,887
Speaker 0: Yeah.

609
00:28:53,861 --> 00:28:58,080
Speaker 0: In fact, when they when they arrest him, he said something like, I was just bored.

610
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,199
Speaker 0: I forget exactly what he says.

611
00:28:59,382 --> 00:29:00,300
Speaker 0: Like the cops.

612
00:29:00,462 --> 00:29:01,098
Speaker 0: Like, what are you doing?

613
00:29:02,161 --> 00:29:04,559
Speaker 1: I'm glad you don't get sent to labor camp for that these days.

614
00:29:05,681 --> 00:29:09,280
Speaker 0: Should we bring labor camps back to show labor camps?

615
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,060
Speaker 1: We need to think to some.

616
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,299
Speaker 1: We you know, we have a labor camp kosha.

617
00:29:12,581 --> 00:29:14,679
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm sure there's someone on earth who needs to be in one.

618
00:29:15,201 --> 00:29:18,286
Speaker 1: But most of the people who are in them do not need to be in them and should not be in them.

619
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,979
Speaker 1: And they're in North Korea or China or places like that.

620
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:29,739
Speaker 1: And, you know, so we even though there might be some people here that need to be in them, we probably shouldn't go doing that until you remove the other people from them to sort of even the scale.

621
00:29:29,942 --> 00:29:31,460
Speaker 0: Scott, are you in parks or parking?

622
00:29:31,602 --> 00:29:32,055
Speaker 1: It's up to you.

623
00:29:32,402 --> 00:29:32,957
Speaker 0: It's up to me.

624
00:29:33,301 --> 00:29:35,099
Speaker 1: I don't really get anything that begins with the word park.

625
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:35,580
Speaker 0: All right.

626
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,360
Speaker 0: So until I lived in New York City, fuck umbrellas.

627
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,580
Speaker 0: I thought umbrellas were stupid.

628
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,198
Speaker 0: Never used one.

629
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,380
Speaker 1: What does it have to do with parking?

630
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:48,838
Speaker 0: Because I drove everywhere and I parked with the car in a parking lot and I lived in the suburbs.

631
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:57,378
Speaker 0: So every place I would ever, ever go had parking that was basically next to the entrance to whatever it was I was going to.

632
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:12,240
Speaker 1: Even when I was in the suburbs and I drove everywhere, I would still often have to park in a parking lot that was relatively far from the entrance such that an umbrella would give me a significant amount of dryness depending on the amount of rain that was coming down.

633
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:22,320
Speaker 0: But the reason I still thought umbrellas were stupid was that if it was raining enough to where I couldn't wait for it to stop raining and enough to where getting wet mattered, wouldn't fucking drive anywhere.

634
00:30:22,602 --> 00:30:23,237
Speaker 1: That's also true.

635
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,180
Speaker 0: I wouldn't go to the mall if it was raining.

636
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:29,860
Speaker 0: There were often cases though where I would- But in New York City now, I'm walking everywhere.

637
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,600
Speaker 0: You cannot avoid being outside no matter what.

638
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:38,720
Speaker 1: There were also often cases where I would drive to a place a significant distance on a schedule and the weather I had no control over.

639
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:44,380
Speaker 1: And when I arrived, I would park in a place and it just, well, it was raining that day.

640
00:30:44,664 --> 00:30:45,640
Speaker 1: What choice did I have?

641
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,760
Speaker 0: See, my schedule, I really never had a schedule except school.

642
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:56,120
Speaker 1: In school, I'd be like, I'm going to so-and-so's house in New Jersey today, vroom, and then I get to New Jersey and it's raining.

643
00:30:56,362 --> 00:30:58,940
Speaker 0: But if it's his house, I park in his driveway.

644
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:06,660
Speaker 1: Except there were these people and they have these gigantic driveways and maybe it's a big party and you park all the way at the street because people already filled up the driveway.

645
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,620
Speaker 0: Now, on the off chance that that happened, you know what I did?

646
00:31:09,442 --> 00:31:12,760
Speaker 0: I had a coat because I'm going somewhere where I can hang my coat up.

647
00:31:12,962 --> 00:31:13,639
Speaker 1: I had a lot of coats.

648
00:31:13,841 --> 00:31:17,360
Speaker 0: And I just walk quickly to the door and don't get that wet.

649
00:31:17,481 --> 00:31:18,518
Speaker 0: So I only needed an umbrella.

650
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:19,799
Speaker 1: My head still gets wet.

651
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:26,740
Speaker 0: In fact, I only owned an umbrella the day I no longer had a car and lived in New York City.

652
00:31:27,081 --> 00:31:31,719
Speaker 0: And then I was like, oh, if it's raining, there is no way to avoid this.

653
00:31:33,302 --> 00:31:36,639
Speaker 1: What if you went to an outdoor event and it happened to rain that day?

654
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,440
Speaker 0: What, I'm going to walk around?

655
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,779
Speaker 1: For example, a music festival.

656
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:46,420
Speaker 0: If someone brought, if I was at like a concert at Pine Knob and some asshole had this giant umbrella, it would probably get broken.

657
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,180
Speaker 1: You don't bring your umbrella up to the mosh pit, right?

658
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,140
Speaker 1: You sit on the hill on the side with your umbrella where you're not blocking anybody.

659
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,875
Speaker 0: No, you're going to get soaking wet anyway because water is going to stream down the hill into your blankie.

660
00:31:56,962 --> 00:31:59,279
Speaker 1: You mean my portable folding chair?

661
00:32:00,889 --> 00:32:01,058
Speaker 0: Yeah.

662
00:32:01,284 --> 00:32:02,060
Speaker 1: And my waterproof boots.

663
00:32:02,201 --> 00:32:05,400
Speaker 0: Again, events like that, if it rained, usually were canceled.

664
00:32:06,381 --> 00:32:07,660
Speaker 1: No, a lot of them keep going.

665
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,020
Speaker 0: No, they were mostly canceled.

666
00:32:09,382 --> 00:32:10,200
Speaker 1: Look up mudstock.

667
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:12,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would not be involved in that.

668
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,198
Speaker 0: I would just go home.

669
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:13,839
Speaker 1: It was too late.

670
00:32:14,021 --> 00:32:15,859
Speaker 1: It was already set like a long time in advance.

671
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,320
Speaker 0: I also never went to big things like, like if I went to a concert.

672
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,740
Speaker 1: I'm not saying I went to these things either.

673
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,240
Speaker 1: I just came up with an example of where an umbrella could be useful.

674
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,460
Speaker 0: I'm saying those examples were irrelevant to my life.

675
00:32:26,781 --> 00:32:28,820
Speaker 1: So what does that do with parks, parking, parkour?

676
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,579
Speaker 0: Because I only needed an umbrella.

677
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,900
Speaker 0: Now we're only talking about parking.

678
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,280
Speaker 0: So I only needed an umbrella when I kind of, it could have been parks, I guess.

679
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,819
Speaker 0: I could, I could have been a long, uh, that could have been a red herring.

680
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:44,858
Speaker 0: So I was, it's funny because yesterday I was talking about this at RIT.

681
00:32:46,141 --> 00:32:54,920
Speaker 0: I would drive to campus and park not that much closer, like surprisingly less closer to the building.

682
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:01,900
Speaker 0: I was trying to just walk to school and it wouldn't have been that much further than But it was further enough to where we would both drive anyway.

683
00:33:03,242 --> 00:33:03,699
Speaker 0: Why was that?

684
00:33:03,841 --> 00:33:04,296
Speaker 0: Why did you drive?

685
00:33:04,801 --> 00:33:05,619
Speaker 1: Because the shuttle bus sucked.

686
00:33:05,921 --> 00:33:06,859
Speaker 0: So why did it suck?

687
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:10,600
Speaker 1: Because the schedule sucked and it dropped you off in a shitty place.

688
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,480
Speaker 0: They always dropped you off like by the SAU cafeteria.

689
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,080
Speaker 0: It's like, great.

690
00:33:14,161 --> 00:33:15,459
Speaker 0: That's like a half hour walk.

691
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:15,765
Speaker 0: Yeah.

692
00:33:16,982 --> 00:33:22,120
Speaker 0: I mean, it was weird because especially when we lived in the dorms, like I wouldn't drive because it would take me 20 minutes to walk.

693
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:28,540
Speaker 0: If I even had a car out to, what was that special lot for freshmen that was basically next to colony.

694
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,299
Speaker 1: Fuck you lot.

695
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:29,760
Speaker 0: Yeah.

696
00:33:30,101 --> 00:33:31,940
Speaker 0: Cause Ken had his car when we were freshmen.

697
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:32,924
Speaker 0: So he'd park out there.

698
00:33:32,964 --> 00:33:40,798
Speaker 0: whenever I'd go grocery shopping, I'd have to walk like 15 minutes to get to his car and then we'd have to walk with our fucking groceries all the way back from that.

699
00:33:40,962 --> 00:33:41,639
Speaker 0: It was awful.

700
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:54,037
Speaker 0: But no, I drive to campus and then walk probably three quarters of a mile to get to the classroom I was going to from, I mean, I was lucky if I could find it was warm the two days.

701
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,293
Speaker 1: It was warm.

702
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,300
Speaker 1: I biked to class.

703
00:33:56,383 --> 00:33:56,779
Speaker 1: That was good.

704
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,840
Speaker 0: I never biked really because I didn't have my bike at RIT, but I would roller blade to.

705
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,278
Speaker 1: I bought one at RIT.

706
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,500
Speaker 0: So that was the bike that eventually exploded.

707
00:34:08,442 --> 00:34:21,199
Speaker 0: What I remember the ironic moment when I realized that one, I could pretty well, I could get around most parking tickets at RIT by having a collection of old parking tickets that I could just kind of write over the current date on and just put it on.

708
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,078
Speaker 1: Sometimes that works.

709
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,639
Speaker 1: And sometimes that's one of those high risk high reward.

710
00:34:24,722 --> 00:34:25,599
Speaker 1: It never didn't work.

711
00:34:25,701 --> 00:34:26,739
Speaker 1: There are times when it did.

712
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:31,197
Speaker 1: I read stories in the Internet of it not working for people and them getting royally fucked because of it.

713
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:36,300
Speaker 0: The thing is, the alibi is I just never took the parking tickets off of my car.

714
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,340
Speaker 0: There's like four of them there.

715
00:34:37,741 --> 00:34:45,159
Speaker 0: You know, they just mail you and they, you know, no, the thing is usually they wouldn't put another ticket on your car usually.

716
00:34:46,067 --> 00:34:46,819
Speaker 0: The other thing was funny.

717
00:34:47,201 --> 00:34:53,815
Speaker 0: I remember is that it was a fifteen dollar fine to park in a place that was not a parking space, but it was a thirty five dollar fine to park in a lot.

718
00:34:53,835 --> 00:34:54,672
Speaker 0: you're not allowed to park in.

719
00:34:55,021 --> 00:35:02,840
Speaker 0: So I would park in the grass next to the lot that was closest to the school because if I got a ticket, I basically paid fifteen dollars for priority.

720
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:08,759
Speaker 1: But if the if the non parking space spot you parked in was too egregious, they would just park like in the middle of the car.

721
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,179
Speaker 1: They would just tow your ass and impound you.

722
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,500
Speaker 0: So I guess you have to park somewhere where they couldn't get a tow truck.

723
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,740
Speaker 1: We are also lucky that we did not go to a school.

724
00:35:16,101 --> 00:35:17,007
Speaker 1: I don't know if they do now.

725
00:35:17,067 --> 00:35:18,799
Speaker 1: that employed the boot.

726
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:22,480
Speaker 1: A lot of places use the boots.

727
00:35:22,861 --> 00:35:31,320
Speaker 0: However, I've seen many places that are many places online where the boot has been confounded by the angle cut grinder.

728
00:35:31,982 --> 00:35:35,140
Speaker 1: I have also seen this, but I would not attempt it myself.

729
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,800
Speaker 1: But luckily, I've never been booted.

730
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,400
Speaker 0: I've also never been booted.

731
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,498
Speaker 1: Nor would I get booted.

732
00:35:40,704 --> 00:35:42,100
Speaker 0: I once got a parking ticket.

733
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,838
Speaker 1: I thought about getting a boot, like just buying one on eBay and just stick it in on someone's car.

734
00:35:46,122 --> 00:35:46,960
Speaker 0: But I got that degree.

735
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,060
Speaker 0: So someone did that to the subway door and then throw away the keys in Queensboro Plaza.

736
00:35:51,221 --> 00:35:53,420
Speaker 1: And then they would call like it would be in like some parking lots.

737
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,500
Speaker 1: They maybe have a Wegmans.

738
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,120
Speaker 1: They go to Wegmans and be like, how did I get booted?

739
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,019
Speaker 1: They call the local cops.

740
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:57,598
Speaker 1: How did I get booted?

741
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:02,640
Speaker 0: And he's like, you better get to put a fake parking ticket that goes to like some number.

742
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,759
Speaker 0: That's just some random dude's cell phone number from like the Yellow Pages.

743
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,080
Speaker 1: No, your worst enemy.

744
00:36:07,864 --> 00:36:09,039
Speaker 1: No, that might trace it back to you.

745
00:36:09,722 --> 00:36:13,175
Speaker 0: The best crimes are the ones that have zero motivation.

746
00:36:13,215 --> 00:36:20,960
Speaker 0: in a parking lot with no security cameras to the security camera sees a nondescript dude wearing jeans and a T-shirt and a hat and sunglasses.

747
00:36:21,448 --> 00:36:21,659
Speaker 0: Great.

748
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:25,760
Speaker 1: Get into a car with your license plate number and drive away after booting a car.

749
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:32,820
Speaker 0: Scott, you park in like the shopping center next door and you walk through those little tiny wooded areas to get back to your car after taking a roundabout route.

750
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,720
Speaker 1: They see a guy carrying a boot to this other parking lot.

751
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,420
Speaker 0: He's in a backpack.

752
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,036
Speaker 0: Scott, I guess I put a lot more thought into elaborate pranks that might involve the police than you have.

753
00:36:43,021 --> 00:36:43,819
Speaker 1: So who are you booting?

754
00:36:44,561 --> 00:36:49,420
Speaker 0: I've never booted anyone, but I have conducted elaborate pranks in those regards.

755
00:36:49,683 --> 00:36:51,159
Speaker 1: Let's buy a whole bunch of boots.

756
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,600
Speaker 0: I just boot every car like on a street.

757
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,640
Speaker 1: Just go somewhere where we like hate people parking in the city and just keep booting them.

758
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,038
Speaker 0: Except I don't really care.

759
00:37:01,162 --> 00:37:03,260
Speaker 0: Cars in Manhattan are beneath my content.

760
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,940
Speaker 1: They are indeed.

761
00:37:06,422 --> 00:37:08,300
Speaker 0: Though parking in Turkey was interesting.

762
00:37:08,764 --> 00:37:09,240
Speaker 1: How is it different?

763
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:09,779
Speaker 0: Because we had a car.

764
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,380
Speaker 0: We fucking drove around Istanbul.

765
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:11,896
Speaker 0: You know what?

766
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,480
Speaker 0: It's mostly the same as driving in Jersey.

767
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,900
Speaker 0: The roads are kind of the same.

768
00:37:17,904 --> 00:37:19,020
Speaker 0: We're driving down the main drive.

769
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,920
Speaker 1: So it's not like India.

770
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:20,500
Speaker 0: No.

771
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:20,955
Speaker 0: God, no.

772
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:24,780
Speaker 0: We're driving down the main drag in Istanbul, like north in the Mazlak area.

773
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:31,000
Speaker 0: And my coworker who was driving in this particular time turns to me and says, this reminds you of Route 9.

774
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,461
Speaker 0: And I was like, this is Route fucking 9.

775
00:37:33,461 --> 00:37:35,560
Speaker 1: So your coworker is, how does that work?

776
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,020
Speaker 1: Are you allowed to drive in other countries?

777
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:39,220
Speaker 0: Every country has different rules.

778
00:37:39,281 --> 00:37:41,220
Speaker 0: In Turkey, they just want to see an American driver's license.

779
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:41,760
Speaker 0: You're good to go.

780
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,600
Speaker 1: They don't need an international driver's license.

781
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,639
Speaker 0: There's no such thing.

782
00:37:44,761 --> 00:37:45,479
Speaker 0: That's a scam.

783
00:37:46,025 --> 00:37:46,539
Speaker 1: I didn't know that.

784
00:37:47,268 --> 00:37:48,360
Speaker 1: You don't need a super license.

785
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,139
Speaker 1: That's a real thing.

786
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:55,620
Speaker 0: In fact, international driver's license, as far as everyone I've ever talked to who travels a lot has told me, are complete bullshit.

787
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:02,059
Speaker 0: Any modern language, any modern country will just take the driver's license from any other modern country and let you drive a car.

788
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,360
Speaker 0: They'll let you rent a car.

789
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,880
Speaker 1: I'm sure you can just go to the State Department website and they'll tell you, right?

790
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,060
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah, actually they will tell you.

791
00:38:08,821 --> 00:38:12,880
Speaker 1: I wonder if you like, what if the only driver's license I had, right?

792
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,540
Speaker 1: Let's say I lived in New York City.

793
00:38:15,103 --> 00:38:18,020
Speaker 1: And I chose to get the state ID instead of the driver's license.

794
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:18,780
Speaker 0: I don't think that.

795
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,440
Speaker 0: Well, I don't think they let you drive with that, obviously.

796
00:38:22,041 --> 00:38:24,960
Speaker 1: But my occupation was F1 driver.

797
00:38:25,382 --> 00:38:28,677
Speaker 1: And I had a FIA super license with which to drive F1 cars.

798
00:38:29,861 --> 00:38:30,519
Speaker 0: So here's my guess.

799
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:34,819
Speaker 1: I could not drive myself to the track, but once I got to the track, I was allowed to drive the F1 car.

800
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,499
Speaker 0: Here's my guess.

801
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,940
Speaker 1: Could I use the super license to drive cars on the regular road?

802
00:38:39,121 --> 00:38:39,757
Speaker 0: Here's my guess.

803
00:38:40,621 --> 00:38:48,160
Speaker 0: In any country where F1 is popular, they would let you do it and would probably hook you up with some cool bullshit.

804
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,574
Speaker 1: I just want to be able to have the cop pull me over and say license registration and show F1 super license.

805
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,539
Speaker 0: Oh man, Captain Jack?

806
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,518
Speaker 0: Is that Captain Jack?

807
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,998
Speaker 0: Oh my God, Captain Jack.

808
00:38:57,303 --> 00:38:58,780
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone remembers that.

809
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,880
Speaker 1: He's like, "Oh, you want to see my license?

810
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:01,439
Speaker 1: How about this?

811
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,179
Speaker 1: Super license.

812
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,200
Speaker 1: And would you like to see my black card size in Joe Turr?

813
00:39:07,742 --> 00:39:09,530
Speaker 1: How about my license to kill James

814
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:09,952
Speaker 1: Bond?".

815
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:20,900
Speaker 0: So one thing that bothers me about parking in general is that even at RIT, like every year they'd have that like, you know, petition the campus, like what would you like us to change on campus?

816
00:39:21,302 --> 00:39:25,100
Speaker 0: And everyone was always like, "We need a parking garage.

817
00:39:25,261 --> 00:39:26,692
Speaker 0: There's not enough parking on

818
00:39:26,733 --> 00:39:27,237
Speaker 0: campus.".

819
00:39:27,843 --> 00:39:28,920
Speaker 1: There was enough parking.

820
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,979
Speaker 1: There was never a time when all the spots were full.

821
00:39:31,341 --> 00:39:38,779
Speaker 0: There were, however, certain time periods when the nearest spot was literally more than a mile away from where you needed to be.

822
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:43,600
Speaker 1: The only spot that you were permitted to park in was far away from where you needed to be.

823
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:47,240
Speaker 1: And all the spots that were close were given to people more important than you.

824
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,480
Speaker 0: Thing is, it wasn't more important.

825
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:54,299
Speaker 0: The way they prioritized was actually, it wasn't really even based on seniority because I was a senior, like my sophomore year.

826
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,276
Speaker 1: I still couldn't get the...

827
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:56,940
Speaker 0: I was a senior and I couldn't get it.

828
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,119
Speaker 0: I never got the fancy parking.

829
00:39:58,962 --> 00:40:01,440
Speaker 0: And even when I wanted to pay for it, the waiting list was longer.

830
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,676
Speaker 0: They were like, "Yeah, you'll graduate before you get through the waiting

831
00:40:03,717 --> 00:40:03,918
Speaker 0: list.".

832
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,280
Speaker 0: And I was like, "Then why is there even a waiting list?

833
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,416
Speaker 0: How can anyone get on

834
00:40:07,497 --> 00:40:07,537
Speaker 0: it?".

835
00:40:07,921 --> 00:40:09,310
Speaker 0: And they were like, "Well, some people go for it

836
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:09,652
Speaker 0: anyway.".

837
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:17,680
Speaker 0: So anyway, they gave parking passes primarily to the commuter students.

838
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:18,609
Speaker 1: Yup.

839
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:22,100
Speaker 1: Well, because obviously they need it more for a legitimate reason.

840
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:29,760
Speaker 1: But the thing is, some people were commuter students, which meant they just had an off-campus house instead of an apartment.

841
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:33,460
Speaker 1: They could have lived right next to the on-campus apartment in a house.

842
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:36,280
Speaker 0: Oh, like those three rear houses that were next to Colony that were rented out by people?

843
00:40:36,402 --> 00:40:37,540
Speaker 1: That was on the same exact road.

844
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:43,120
Speaker 1: They could have lived across the street from RIT, literally, but they counted as a commuter student because they didn't live in on-campus housing.

845
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,389
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, I live in Colony.

846
00:40:44,429 --> 00:40:47,420
Speaker 0: that's fucking like on the other... It's barely on campus.

847
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,319
Speaker 0: It's like in the middle of this marsh all by itself.

848
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:53,520
Speaker 1: Well, they also gave all the parking passes to faculty and staff.

849
00:40:53,681 --> 00:40:55,640
Speaker 1: Those people just could park wherever the hell they wanted.

850
00:40:56,021 --> 00:41:02,360
Speaker 0: Granted, for a while, what I did is I took the RIT sticker off my car for a while, because I didn't drive to campus that often.

851
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:08,360
Speaker 0: It was for like a couple months, and I parked in the visitor parking lot with no identification on my car whatsoever.

852
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,720
Speaker 0: So, basically, a car parked...

853
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,179
Speaker 1: But don't you need to get a visitor pass to do that from a building and then go stick it on your car?

854
00:41:13,921 --> 00:41:28,919
Speaker 0: Yes, but from what I learned from people who worked there, basically, they only looked in that lot to see if there were RIT stickers, because if they weren't, they assumed it was like a parent or something who was going to get the visitor pass, because you can only go to that little booth if you're trying to park in that roundabout.

855
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:34,359
Speaker 0: What was interesting is if you had an RIT sticker, they would not even let you drive into that roundabout.

856
00:41:35,044 --> 00:41:35,920
Speaker 0: They would only let you drive in.

857
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:40,518
Speaker 0: I had the Anime Club Super Pass, because I ran the club, that let me go in there, because I could load and unload.

858
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,719
Speaker 0: But otherwise... No, it wouldn't let me park.

859
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,960
Speaker 0: There were only like four parking spaces there anyway.

860
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,338
Speaker 0: I think like... The president parked there.

861
00:41:49,285 --> 00:41:49,496
Speaker 1: Whatever.

862
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:50,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway.

863
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,937
Speaker 0: But everyone would always be like, "Yo, we need a parking

864
00:41:52,957 --> 00:41:53,358
Speaker 0: garage.".

865
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,040
Speaker 0: One, it takes so long to park in the top of a parking garage, you're better off just parking a mile away and walking.

866
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:05,840
Speaker 1: Well, unless the parking garage has an elevator that goes right into the building, like a convention center or a hotel, right?

867
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:11,000
Speaker 0: Two, parking garages are way expensive, and in Rochester, would not last that long.

868
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:11,938
Speaker 1: No, you know, it's cold.

869
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,000
Speaker 1: Well, remember the parking garage collapse in Vigipsy?

870
00:42:15,181 --> 00:42:16,240
Speaker 0: Oh my God, I remember that.

871
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,592
Speaker 0: We went to the mall one day, we're like, "Whoa,

872
00:42:17,995 --> 00:42:18,379
Speaker 0: ho-ho.".

873
00:42:18,561 --> 00:42:19,480
Speaker 1: I've parked on that.

874
00:42:19,765 --> 00:42:20,620
Speaker 1: I've parked under that.

875
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,400
Speaker 1: And I knew it was shady when I parked on that.

876
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,518
Speaker 0: Every time we went there, we're like, "Man, this place is some shady shit right

877
00:42:25,558 --> 00:42:25,719
Speaker 0: here.".

878
00:42:26,101 --> 00:42:28,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, eventually I'm glad I started parking out by the Target, Target.

879
00:42:29,701 --> 00:42:30,699
Speaker 0: I'm actually gladder.

880
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:39,997
Speaker 0: There's the one time we drove, you know, every weekend we drive up the road to the mall just because it's what you do, and one day I was like, "Wait a minute, we don't need

881
00:42:40,077 --> 00:42:40,399
Speaker 0: anything.".

882
00:42:41,464 --> 00:42:45,260
Speaker 0: And the arcade doesn't... Like, Initial D doesn't really work anymore, there's no more DDR machine.

883
00:42:46,389 --> 00:42:48,078
Speaker 0: Why are we even... Let's just go home.

884
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,519
Speaker 0: And then we just stopped, we never went up the road again.

885
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,880
Speaker 1: We did, just not often.

886
00:42:52,101 --> 00:42:52,837
Speaker 0: When we were forced to.

887
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:53,233
Speaker 0: Yeah.

888
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,199
Speaker 0: By emergencies.

889
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,820
Speaker 1: Well, we went to Dragon's Den sometimes.

890
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we even went there less and less because malls fell apart.

891
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:00,233
Speaker 0: We did.

892
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,720
Speaker 0: Remember we used to run their website?

893
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:02,235
Speaker 0: Yep.

894
00:43:03,265 --> 00:43:03,940
Speaker 0: Those were dark days.

895
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,679
Speaker 1: For all five minutes.

896
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,011
Speaker 0: Yeah.

897
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:05,287
Speaker 0: Okay.

898
00:43:06,043 --> 00:43:06,658
Speaker 0: Oh my gosh.

899
00:43:08,343 --> 00:43:10,940
Speaker 0: So, how was that alternate side parking when you had the car here?

900
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:17,659
Speaker 1: Yeah, I brought my car to New York City when I first moved here, and I used the car to move here by making a bunch of trips.

901
00:43:17,881 --> 00:43:22,998
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I borrowed that car the last time I drove it when I took it to the Oticon staff meeting.

902
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:23,656
Speaker 1: Oh, right.

903
00:43:24,088 --> 00:43:24,178
Speaker 1: Yeah.

904
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:30,139
Speaker 1: And then, you know, I had it here just because I didn't know what to do with it, and I used it rarely, like once or twice a month.

905
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:37,440
Speaker 1: But there's alternate side parking in New York City, which means they like to sweep the streets to keep them clean, and the street sweeper comes through.

906
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:39,900
Speaker 1: So you have to move your car to the other side of the street.

907
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,040
Speaker 0: I learned something recently.

908
00:43:41,521 --> 00:43:45,200
Speaker 0: In rich neighborhoods, they do it less often because the rich people don't want to have to move their cars as much.

909
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:45,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, it depends.

910
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,520
Speaker 1: Every neighborhood is different, every street is different.

911
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:56,280
Speaker 1: So where I lived, it was basically this side of the street Monday, Friday, that side of the street Tuesday, Thursday, and some days they cancel it, like holidays and snow days, you know.

912
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:01,040
Speaker 1: And you basically have to check the news and the Twitter and those things to find out when alternate side parking has been suspended.

913
00:44:01,121 --> 00:44:03,000
Speaker 1: So when it's suspended, you could park anywhere.

914
00:44:03,421 --> 00:44:10,760
Speaker 1: If it's not suspended, that means you can't park on that side of the street between the hours of eight in the morning and 10.

915
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,277
Speaker 0: If you do, they'll put a sticker that you basically can't get off your window.

916
00:44:14,337 --> 00:44:17,060
Speaker 0: that basically says I'm a douchebag, and they give you a ticket.

917
00:44:17,301 --> 00:44:17,462
Speaker 1: Right.

918
00:44:17,482 --> 00:44:18,004
Speaker 1: It's not good.

919
00:44:18,084 --> 00:44:23,020
Speaker 0: So basically, if you I saw a car once in the Bronx that had like 20 of those stickers, like blocking a window.

920
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:23,301
Speaker 0: Yeah.

921
00:44:23,321 --> 00:44:29,759
Speaker 1: So if you work, this basically means you have to move your car back and forth across the street, you know, three, four times a week.

922
00:44:30,922 --> 00:44:34,158
Speaker 1: So that's what I did for a month or two before I got it for you.

923
00:44:34,742 --> 00:44:36,320
Speaker 1: It's really not fun at all.

924
00:44:36,822 --> 00:44:39,640
Speaker 1: I know some places, though, it's just like once a week at one time.

925
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,764
Speaker 1: So it's like just don't be don't have your car on that side of the street on Thursday night.

926
00:44:44,865 --> 00:44:46,199
Speaker 1: And that's pretty easy to do.

927
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,265
Speaker 1: It's less troublesome.

928
00:44:47,345 --> 00:44:53,680
Speaker 1: But, you know, basically, I'm never going to have a car in New York City unless a all of the above.

929
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:54,625
Speaker 1: Right.

930
00:44:54,645 --> 00:44:57,660
Speaker 1: A, I have enough money to afford the car.

931
00:44:58,221 --> 00:44:58,523
Speaker 1: Right.

932
00:44:58,725 --> 00:45:00,399
Speaker 1: And, you know, where I don't even give a shit.

933
00:45:00,582 --> 00:45:00,683
Speaker 1: Right.

934
00:45:00,704 --> 00:45:01,760
Speaker 1: Because I'm trying to save money.

935
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,895
Speaker 1: I'll rent or zip car.

936
00:45:02,936 --> 00:45:03,180
Speaker 1: Who knows?

937
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:03,481
Speaker 1: Right.

938
00:45:03,662 --> 00:45:06,956
Speaker 1: Where I don't even give a shit about saving money to I can.

939
00:45:07,036 --> 00:45:11,100
Speaker 1: I don't give a shit about money so much that I can buy a permanent parking space.

940
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:15,040
Speaker 1: That is my parking space in a driveway or a garage right now in my building.

941
00:45:15,361 --> 00:45:19,660
Speaker 0: I could get one for a hundred and fifteen dollars a month.

942
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,863
Speaker 1: That is similar to what they charge in my building, which only has four spots, all of which are occupied.

943
00:45:24,766 --> 00:45:29,885
Speaker 1: And two, I can get a car that's worth owning that I'll own for a really long time.

944
00:45:29,905 --> 00:45:31,979
Speaker 1: That'll be really reliable and last a long time.

945
00:45:32,421 --> 00:45:37,361
Speaker 1: So those things are all unlikely unless I win the lottery or get mega rich or who knows what.

946
00:45:37,602 --> 00:45:45,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's part of the reason why I'm so disencompassed to move to any non New York City, because even if I did that, even if I did all those things.

947
00:45:45,545 --> 00:45:47,059
Speaker 1: How often would I use that car?

948
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:48,303
Speaker 0: Almost never.

949
00:45:48,343 --> 00:45:51,320
Speaker 0: I would use cars a lot because I ski pretty much every weekend.

950
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:55,600
Speaker 0: And while the bus is good, be really nice just if I can get up and I don't I don't ski.

951
00:45:55,701 --> 00:45:56,777
Speaker 1: So when would I use the car?

952
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, you lead a closer life.

953
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:00,108
Speaker 0: Plus, you have your bicycle.

954
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:00,674
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

955
00:46:01,381 --> 00:46:01,603
Speaker 1: Right.

956
00:46:01,643 --> 00:46:03,699
Speaker 1: So where am I going to go with this car?

957
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,640
Speaker 1: Maybe I would get the car, put the bicycle on top and go somewhere to bike differently.

958
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:09,446
Speaker 1: Thing is, we're going to.

959
00:46:09,506 --> 00:46:10,779
Speaker 1: I could just bike there.

960
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:18,032
Speaker 0: Plus, if we're going to do that, like if we're doing something crazy, like we're going to take our bikes, like, I don't know, Albany or something, you mean Emily, you're going to take a zip car anyway.

961
00:46:18,073 --> 00:46:18,680
Speaker 0: That's way cheaper.

962
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,188
Speaker 1: But I'm saying that's now I'm talking about the.

963
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:24,700
Speaker 1: even if I was mega rich and bought a car in a parking space, when would I use that car?

964
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:25,698
Speaker 1: It's got to be unused.

965
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,140
Speaker 1: You also have it once a month.

966
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:27,602
Speaker 1: I'd use it.

967
00:46:27,622 --> 00:46:31,280
Speaker 0: You also have a driver and we all share the driver, even if I had a driver.

968
00:46:31,621 --> 00:46:34,080
Speaker 1: How often would that driver actually need to drive me somewhere?

969
00:46:34,721 --> 00:46:35,104
Speaker 0: I you know what?

970
00:46:35,286 --> 00:46:36,679
Speaker 0: Pretty often, you know what I would use it for?

971
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:37,566
Speaker 1: Just going to work.

972
00:46:37,849 --> 00:46:39,080
Speaker 0: No, God, are you kidding?

973
00:46:39,562 --> 00:46:50,620
Speaker 0: In the winter, if I wanted to eat out all those awesome places in Brooklyn that I can bike to in the summer, but not in the winter, I would drop you off in front of the restaurant and then have him pick you up in front of the restaurant.

974
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:59,180
Speaker 0: I would eat in Brooklyn a lot more often if I didn't have to take the G down there, because right along Greenpoint Avenue, there's a lot of really good restaurants.

975
00:47:00,461 --> 00:47:07,780
Speaker 0: And I actually like whenever I do eat over there, I really almost want to move there just because there's so many good restaurants.

976
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:12,723
Speaker 1: Maybe twice a year I would have him bring me to and from the Javits before the seven is extended.

977
00:47:12,924 --> 00:47:13,588
Speaker 0: Yep.

978
00:47:13,729 --> 00:47:15,460
Speaker 0: And the next year it might be almost done.

979
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:18,100
Speaker 1: I saw pictures of boring ass tunnels.

980
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:18,641
Speaker 0: Yep.

981
00:47:19,306 --> 00:47:21,300
Speaker 0: The tunnels look so clean, though, but they're boring.

982
00:47:21,442 --> 00:47:22,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, they are kind of boring.

983
00:47:23,223 --> 00:47:24,357
Speaker 0: Well, they're boring.

984
00:47:25,262 --> 00:47:26,579
Speaker 1: No, I think they finished that part.

985
00:47:27,103 --> 00:47:28,939
Speaker 0: I think they did cut and cover actually for the end.

986
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:29,683
Speaker 1: Whatever.

987
00:47:29,824 --> 00:47:31,980
Speaker 1: Anyway, the anything else.

988
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:36,484
Speaker 0: This is why I could never moved was like New York City is like one of the only cities I could live in.

989
00:47:37,006 --> 00:47:42,479
Speaker 0: Moving anywhere else would really fuck up my jam, because the whole reason to live here is that I literally do not need a car.

990
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:45,620
Speaker 0: Parking is not something that exists for me anymore.

991
00:47:45,941 --> 00:47:51,800
Speaker 1: No, even though there's so many cars here and so much parking and people are fighting over the parking, have trouble with it and they fight over it.

992
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,520
Speaker 1: But it's like, why are you driving?

993
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,404
Speaker 1: I don't need to drive.

994
00:47:54,484 --> 00:47:59,420
Speaker 1: Even if I moved your handicapped or old or, you know, you have those reasons that you need to drive.

995
00:47:59,541 --> 00:48:01,200
Speaker 1: But not all of you have those reasons.

996
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,599
Speaker 1: Most of you don't have those reasons.

997
00:48:03,142 --> 00:48:10,220
Speaker 0: But even if I moved to like Boston or Seattle, I'd still need a car because their mass transit systems are kind of weak sauce.

998
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:15,599
Speaker 0: Well, even if they're kind of OK, like Seattle, I wouldn't because you can walk across the entire city in like 30 minutes.

999
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:20,660
Speaker 1: But even in Boston, where it's kind of OK, the system, it shuts down at night.

1000
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,496
Speaker 1: Then what do you do?

1001
00:48:22,041 --> 00:48:26,560
Speaker 0: And, you know, the last time I brought this up, a bunch of people were like, but what are you doing out like three in the morning?

1002
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:27,223
Speaker 0: Like you kidding?

1003
00:48:27,243 --> 00:48:30,539
Speaker 0: Do you know how often I'm getting out a subway train to go home?

1004
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:32,429
Speaker 1: OK, not even three in the morning.

1005
00:48:32,489 --> 00:48:34,580
Speaker 1: tomorrow after work, there's going to be Netrunner.

1006
00:48:34,702 --> 00:48:38,380
Speaker 1: that starts at six p.m Those guys, a lot of them leave at like midnight.

1007
00:48:38,702 --> 00:48:39,028
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1008
00:48:39,231 --> 00:48:39,659
Speaker 1: Guess what?

1009
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,620
Speaker 1: That none of the other subways in the world are running at that hour.

1010
00:48:43,982 --> 00:48:46,339
Speaker 1: But I can just get on a choo choo train and go home really quick.

1011
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:46,922
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1012
00:48:47,203 --> 00:48:51,099
Speaker 1: For, you know, ostensibly two dollars and change, but really zero dollars.

1013
00:48:52,601 --> 00:48:59,212
Speaker 0: So would you believe that I while I learned to parallel park and I could do it because I had a driver's license, you have to learn that stuff?

1014
00:48:59,232 --> 00:49:03,060
Speaker 0: because, yeah, parallel parking is a really good test of whether or not you actually know how to drive.

1015
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,480
Speaker 0: If you can't do it, you're actually probably a pretty bad driver.

1016
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I know you're in an unfamiliar car.

1017
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,298
Speaker 1: You're not sure how far the back is.

1018
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:15,280
Speaker 0: You know, I've only once or twice ever seen you successfully parallel park.

1019
00:49:15,461 --> 00:49:16,420
Speaker 1: I parallel park all the time.

1020
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,820
Speaker 0: I've seen you fail many times.

1021
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:19,639
Speaker 1: When have I failed?

1022
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,043
Speaker 0: All right.

1023
00:49:21,103 --> 00:49:24,760
Speaker 0: So it was two or three times ago when you still had your car.

1024
00:49:25,122 --> 00:49:28,360
Speaker 0: And I recall very specifically we went up to Albany or something.

1025
00:49:28,823 --> 00:49:29,387
Speaker 0: We parked.

1026
00:49:29,729 --> 00:49:31,279
Speaker 0: We're going to parallel park to go get food.

1027
00:49:32,441 --> 00:49:37,419
Speaker 0: And you went it and your front was taken out and you went to get in.

1028
00:49:37,983 --> 00:49:38,287
Speaker 1: All right.

1029
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:39,199
Speaker 0: And it was pretty funny.

1030
00:49:39,963 --> 00:49:40,608
Speaker 0: And I laughed at you.

1031
00:49:40,689 --> 00:49:41,960
Speaker 1: I got in eventually.

1032
00:49:42,542 --> 00:49:43,820
Speaker 0: But you failed in the first go.

1033
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,158
Speaker 0: You did not have a clean delivery.

1034
00:49:46,062 --> 00:49:49,140
Speaker 1: Not, you know, even people are experts in parallel parking, right?

1035
00:49:49,481 --> 00:49:51,340
Speaker 1: You know, who parallel park every day of their lives.

1036
00:49:51,441 --> 00:49:55,385
Speaker 1: They live like in Flushing or something and they parallel park in front of their house every single day.

1037
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:58,120
Speaker 0: Sometimes you just know nothing.

1038
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,658
Speaker 0: But net you never miss.

1039
00:50:00,261 --> 00:50:04,040
Speaker 1: Listen, even professional basketball players, you know, foul shots.

1040
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,129
Speaker 1: No one has one hundred percent.

1041
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:06,179
Speaker 1: No one.

1042
00:50:06,721 --> 00:50:07,043
Speaker 1: Right.

1043
00:50:07,605 --> 00:50:10,380
Speaker 1: Just because, you know, Michael Schumacher, he won most of the races.

1044
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:17,960
Speaker 0: So would you believe in every race until two thousand and three or four?

1045
00:50:18,824 --> 00:50:20,802
Speaker 0: And I've been driving since I was 14.

1046
00:50:20,802 --> 00:50:22,499
Speaker 0: I'd never actually parallel park.

1047
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,473
Speaker 1: Well, you're in Michigan.

1048
00:50:23,493 --> 00:50:23,656
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1049
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:25,940
Speaker 0: Parallel parking was this crazy thing.

1050
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,120
Speaker 0: Like you learn it in driver's ed, but it's literally like just an exercise.

1051
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,740
Speaker 0: Like, why would you ever parallel in Connecticut?

1052
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,380
Speaker 1: They didn't actually make us parallel park.

1053
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:35,779
Speaker 1: They made us back into a parking space.

1054
00:50:36,301 --> 00:50:38,580
Speaker 0: A lot of parking lots actually don't allow you to do that.

1055
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:39,404
Speaker 0: I have rules against it.

1056
00:50:39,706 --> 00:50:42,040
Speaker 1: Well, the diagonal ones should have rules against it.

1057
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,445
Speaker 0: But the straight one should do.

1058
00:50:43,706 --> 00:50:47,572
Speaker 0: basically if you ever back into a regular parking space, you're doing it wrong.

1059
00:50:47,592 --> 00:50:48,040
Speaker 0: You're not.

1060
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:49,131
Speaker 0: There's no reason to do.

1061
00:50:49,152 --> 00:50:49,699
Speaker 0: there is.

1062
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:56,900
Speaker 1: There are incredibly rare circumstances where there may be a reason to do it, but they are most extremely, extremely rare.

1063
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,600
Speaker 0: Most people who I see doing this there, I've kind of talked to people I knew who did this.

1064
00:51:00,861 --> 00:51:04,520
Speaker 0: They'd always be at the train station in Beacon and they'd be like backed into the space.

1065
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:08,460
Speaker 0: They'd always say because I can get out of the parking lot quicker at the end.

1066
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:09,141
Speaker 1: Not really.

1067
00:51:09,221 --> 00:51:21,500
Speaker 0: That is actually false, because why do front end loaders and pallet jacks and forklifts have the wheels in the rear that turn instead of the wheels in the front?

1068
00:51:22,221 --> 00:51:23,318
Speaker 0: Because it's more maneuverable.

1069
00:51:23,962 --> 00:51:29,920
Speaker 0: Getting out of a parking space, you want the wheels that are turning to be furthest into the parking space for maximum maneuverability.

1070
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:33,540
Speaker 0: It's easier to trap someone in if they're facing forward than they're facing backward.

1071
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,343
Speaker 1: That is correct.

1072
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:41,200
Speaker 1: However, the only rare example I'm trying to think of those rare examples is you do the pull through, but then you didn't back in.

1073
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,078
Speaker 0: You just pulled through.

1074
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:53,020
Speaker 1: Well, what if there is snow and it's unplowed and your front wheel drive, it may be advantageous to put the front wheels closer to the street part, which may become plowed.

1075
00:51:53,321 --> 00:52:01,460
Speaker 1: Thus making it easier to shovel your way out, because then you can shovel in front of those front tires as opposed to having to get between the cars plowed.

1076
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,634
Speaker 0: You're going to be plowed in.

1077
00:52:03,842 --> 00:52:04,645
Speaker 1: Now you have to.

1078
00:52:04,846 --> 00:52:09,163
Speaker 1: only you have to overcome that hump with your front wheel drive right right there.

1079
00:52:09,565 --> 00:52:14,040
Speaker 0: If you have rear wheel drive, you might actually know you pretty much have even worse problems with rear wheel drive.

1080
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:14,622
Speaker 0: Right.

1081
00:52:14,642 --> 00:52:21,000
Speaker 1: But either way, with the rear wheel drive, you know, you have to figure you might factor this in which direction you park, knowing.

1082
00:52:21,261 --> 00:52:22,265
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm going to gut.

1083
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:29,360
Speaker 0: I'm going to gut it and say that I think you still in any situation where there's that this is going to suck at the snow no matter what.

1084
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:37,200
Speaker 1: But you might if you depending on the drive of your car, you may have better chance of getting out of the spot easily, depending on the direction.

1085
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:42,046
Speaker 0: So more importantly, if you don't set the parking brake when you park your car, you are stupid.

1086
00:52:42,066 --> 00:52:42,960
Speaker 0: You're a bad person.

1087
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:43,665
Speaker 1: That is correct.

1088
00:52:43,948 --> 00:52:44,210
Speaker 0: You are.

1089
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:44,552
Speaker 0: You're just.

1090
00:52:44,592 --> 00:52:45,560
Speaker 0: you're a bad human being.

1091
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:46,125
Speaker 1: That is right.

1092
00:52:46,731 --> 00:52:47,720
Speaker 1: Most people don't do it.

1093
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:51,625
Speaker 1: They just put the car in park and then they take their foot off the brake and the car goes schlump.

1094
00:52:52,288 --> 00:52:54,420
Speaker 1: Right when the car goes schlump.

1095
00:52:55,021 --> 00:52:55,322
Speaker 1: Right.

1096
00:52:55,623 --> 00:53:01,679
Speaker 1: You basically put the weight of the car on park P, which is this thing in a transmission park.

1097
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,308
Speaker 1: Right.

1098
00:53:03,329 --> 00:53:04,219
Speaker 1: That is not good.

1099
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:09,106
Speaker 1: If you would put the emergency brake on and then take your foot off the brake, your car doesn't go schlump.

1100
00:53:09,146 --> 00:53:10,799
Speaker 1: It just sort of stays where it was.

1101
00:53:11,282 --> 00:53:20,300
Speaker 1: And now the weight of the car is resting on the parking brake, which is a ten dollar piece of metal and a spring and a cable, as opposed to a multi-thousand dollar transmission.

1102
00:53:21,722 --> 00:53:26,144
Speaker 1: You know, not saying that leaving your car and I bring this up because it's going to break your transmission.

1103
00:53:26,485 --> 00:53:33,104
Speaker 0: But I'm just saying there were several instances at RIT where I had a bunch of drink and I had someone else to drive my car back like from a party or something.

1104
00:53:33,124 --> 00:53:34,260
Speaker 1: They didn't undo the parking.

1105
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:34,581
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1106
00:53:34,601 --> 00:53:36,180
Speaker 0: They start to drive and they start driving.

1107
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,980
Speaker 1: You do it and they wouldn't put the brake undo.

1108
00:53:39,301 --> 00:53:39,563
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1109
00:53:40,066 --> 00:53:42,020
Speaker 1: And they start driving with the parking brake on going.

1110
00:53:44,523 --> 00:53:48,767
Speaker 1: And it's like, OK, you're destroying my ten dollar piece of plastic and also hurting my car.

1111
00:53:48,788 --> 00:53:49,338
Speaker 1: What's wrong with you?

1112
00:53:49,842 --> 00:53:52,619
Speaker 0: Actually, my car couldn't back out of the parking space with the brake fully pulled in.

1113
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,120
Speaker 1: I had that that tempo could actually drive with the parking brake.

1114
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,640
Speaker 0: I know because we left it engaged one time because it wasn't obvious.

1115
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:01,376
Speaker 0: Yeah, I remember that old cars.

1116
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:06,320
Speaker 0: So parking now, the last time I drove anywhere.

1117
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:11,641
Speaker 1: So, yeah, you use that parking brake even if you're on a hill, even if you're not on a hill.

1118
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:11,842
Speaker 0: What?

1119
00:54:12,385 --> 00:54:17,979
Speaker 0: Even if you're on a hill, that's like if you if you're a soldier and you have a gun, you use it even if you're in a firefight.

1120
00:54:18,261 --> 00:54:25,840
Speaker 1: When you're on a hill, when you're not on a hill, when you're no matter what, when you stop the car, you have your foot on the regular brake.

1121
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:26,282
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1122
00:54:26,302 --> 00:54:30,382
Speaker 1: You turn you put the car in park, then you pull the park or neutral if it's a manual.

1123
00:54:30,442 --> 00:54:30,703
Speaker 1: Right.

1124
00:54:31,065 --> 00:54:34,240
Speaker 1: You turn the manuals are obsolete technology.

1125
00:54:34,462 --> 00:54:34,684
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1126
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:35,370
Speaker 0: Except for race cars.

1127
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:36,339
Speaker 1: You turn the car.

1128
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:36,921
Speaker 1: I said it.

1129
00:54:37,182 --> 00:54:37,504
Speaker 1: Right.

1130
00:54:37,644 --> 00:54:44,443
Speaker 1: And then you engage the parking slash emergency brake and then you take your foot off the regular brake and then you get out of the car and leaving from parking.

1131
00:54:44,544 --> 00:54:46,739
Speaker 0: You get in your car, you start the engine.

1132
00:54:47,001 --> 00:54:53,659
Speaker 0: You had your foot on the regular brake, put your foot on the brake, then you release the emergency brake, then you take your car out of park.

1133
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:54,262
Speaker 1: Yes.

1134
00:54:54,523 --> 00:54:57,619
Speaker 1: Into our or or whatever it is.

1135
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,060
Speaker 0: It's probably our or or it could be.

1136
00:55:02,583 --> 00:55:05,619
Speaker 0: Could be the deal with the O around it, the cartouche.

1137
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:09,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever it is you put it into neutral.

1138
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:09,766
Speaker 1: You're on a hill.

1139
00:55:09,786 --> 00:55:10,478
Speaker 1: You're going to roll down.

1140
00:55:12,302 --> 00:55:20,920
Speaker 0: So I won't in a name, but I think the saddest anecdote in this is one time me, Scott and someone we know, we're in my car, my sunfire.

1141
00:55:21,361 --> 00:55:26,540
Speaker 0: We were in Beacon and we drove up to up to Fishkill across to eat at a restaurant.

1142
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:32,160
Speaker 0: You park the car parallel park wise and I stop and our friend opens.

1143
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:37,482
Speaker 0: He's in the passenger seat and Scott's in the back and he opens the door and finds that his weight.

1144
00:55:37,503 --> 00:55:42,717
Speaker 0: Has brought the door down such that he cannot actually open the door and the door becomes jammed in the grass.

1145
00:55:43,823 --> 00:55:44,068
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

1146
00:55:44,251 --> 00:55:44,719
Speaker 0: Remember that?

1147
00:55:45,261 --> 00:56:03,585
Speaker 1: No, I remember when we were at a station and we got out of the car and he went, we saw that the shock in the car had been so depressed by the weight of people in the backseat that we had to sort of push the car back up to sort of refill the shock with gas.

1148
00:56:03,605 --> 00:56:06,920
Speaker 0: So there I remember that there was a worse situation than that.

1149
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,640
Speaker 0: This was when I was driving to New York City with Lisa one time the night before.

1150
00:56:11,042 --> 00:56:12,659
Speaker 0: I think you were with me and Pete was with me.

1151
00:56:13,241 --> 00:56:18,420
Speaker 0: And no, I was with you and I was like, my rear tire is kind of low.

1152
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:20,300
Speaker 0: I should go put some air in it.

1153
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,069
Speaker 0: You're like, no, no, no.

1154
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:21,840
Speaker 0: Pick Pete up first.

1155
00:56:22,985 --> 00:56:23,858
Speaker 0: So we go to pick Pete up.

1156
00:56:24,321 --> 00:56:27,120
Speaker 0: We get to Pete's place and Pete's like, dude, your tire is fucking flat.

1157
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:28,259
Speaker 0: It's fucking flat.

1158
00:56:28,521 --> 00:56:29,599
Speaker 0: It's flat as fuck.

1159
00:56:30,561 --> 00:56:35,840
Speaker 0: So I limp over to a gas station and I'm like, all right, let's try to fill it.

1160
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:36,522
Speaker 0: Now it's done.

1161
00:56:37,044 --> 00:56:39,432
Speaker 0: So I'm propping the car up to put the donut on.

1162
00:56:40,034 --> 00:56:47,280
Speaker 0: and remember I start jacking the car up and the car goes up and the tire is still touching the ground because the shocks are just fucking shot.

1163
00:56:48,083 --> 00:56:49,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, I do remember that aspect.

1164
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:53,220
Speaker 0: So I got the real tire like fitted on the rim again and working.

1165
00:56:53,801 --> 00:56:57,681
Speaker 0: And then I lowered the car back down and the one tire is just like up on a still like doop.

1166
00:56:58,263 --> 00:57:05,139
Speaker 0: So I had Pete like push it back down and then I drove on that dubious piece of shit to New York City the next morning.

1167
00:57:15,248 --> 00:57:17,390
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.
