1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,746
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, January 7th.

2
00:00:12,027 --> 00:00:12,508
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:13,190
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,837
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights tonight, K.O.

5
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:16,820
Speaker 0: Century Beast!

6
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:26,908
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:31,057 --> 00:00:37,230
Speaker 0: So at work We kind of through various means ended up acquiring like basically the whole floor that we're on in the building.

8
00:00:37,311 --> 00:00:38,862
Speaker 1: Did you have most of the floor ready?

9
00:00:39,184 --> 00:00:53,830
Speaker 0: We had a lot of it But now we've got like enough of it to where we're gonna do major construction and because we the whole thing about our office That's cool is that all the walls are glass and there are some people or groups that have I guess separate rooms because you know Various reasons we don't want the thing to be one giant room.

10
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:59,470
Speaker 0: So we've got glass walls everywhere just to make it still feel open and everyone can kind of see everyone and talk to everyone.

11
00:00:59,673 --> 00:01:11,283
Speaker 0: And we have video Conferencing running all the time between all the different offices conference rooms and things and even around the world like every office We've got has 24/7 video conference with like the conference rooms and all the other offices.

12
00:01:11,684 --> 00:01:11,945
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

13
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:18,710
Speaker 0: It's actually really cool, but Now that we've got all this new space that old companies were in we're going all out.

14
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,590
Speaker 0: So we're like knocking down all the walls between all the spaces and replacing it with these other companies have like big offices or what?

15
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,569
Speaker 0: Well between all of them we got a lot of space.

16
00:01:28,792 --> 00:01:43,598
Speaker 0: So, you know we got to knock down all the walls and basically they built the new space completely based on all our new designs And everything and now they moved a bunch of people in there And now they got to move people out of the second space that we got a long time ago Into the first space so that we can move people.

17
00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:54,349
Speaker 0: basically we're shuffling all around and my department which is only four people Anyway, that's how badass we are got Put into one of the old conference rooms near where we used to be.

18
00:01:55,112 --> 00:01:59,530
Speaker 0: So now I effectively have a corner office, but it's on the wrong corner of the building.

19
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,987
Speaker 0: So I basically get to look at the back of Pershing Square and like 41st Street.

20
00:02:05,713 --> 00:02:09,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, hey like those there's a lot of like windows depending on which side of the building you're on.

21
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:12,970
Speaker 1: You could be looking at like an alley or you could be looking at like the water.

22
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,337
Speaker 0: It's like well like some streets.

23
00:02:14,397 --> 00:02:16,690
Speaker 0: to like 42nd Street is like a main street.

24
00:02:17,073 --> 00:02:23,867
Speaker 0: So if you go to a 33rd Street or 41st Street It's mostly like the backs of big buildings as opposed to the fronts of smaller buildings.

25
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,389
Speaker 1: Yep.

26
00:02:24,609 --> 00:02:27,829
Speaker 0: Yep Yep, so it's all like loading docks here working in a conference room.

27
00:02:28,672 --> 00:02:30,630
Speaker 0: Well, we turn the conference room into our office.

28
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:32,436
Speaker 1: You brought desks in there.

29
00:02:32,757 --> 00:02:33,962
Speaker 0: actually, you know, we got desk.

30
00:02:34,022 --> 00:02:34,644
Speaker 1: or did you just have?

31
00:02:34,704 --> 00:02:36,350
Speaker 1: are you just sitting around one big table?

32
00:02:36,692 --> 00:02:37,697
Speaker 0: You know how we got desks.

33
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:40,350
Speaker 0: hmm because so many, you know, the economy's bad.

34
00:02:40,431 --> 00:02:42,650
Speaker 0: So a lot of other companies aren't doing really well.

35
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,479
Speaker 1: You just took them from the companies moved out the office.

36
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:49,433
Speaker 0: the building basically said look we own all this stuff down We don't want it.

37
00:02:49,534 --> 00:02:51,403
Speaker 0: So anyone who wants it take it.

38
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,394
Speaker 0: So we took it all and we're yeah Why not?

39
00:02:53,435 --> 00:02:54,808
Speaker 1: the worst is you can sell it.

40
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:59,970
Speaker 0: So I got this brand new desk and the four of us have this like corner office and we're private from everyone.

41
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,262
Speaker 0: but the problem what I was worried about?

42
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:08,570
Speaker 0: they moved while I was on break and That room Woman space is one cold mother.

43
00:03:09,413 --> 00:03:10,779
Speaker 0: That room was so cold.

44
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,269
Speaker 0: Like it just it was in a freezing room.

45
00:03:13,671 --> 00:03:18,610
Speaker 0: So we got boiler heat on the windows that we turn all the way up and it's bearable.

46
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:29,070
Speaker 0: But the only reason it's bearable is not because the room is a comfortable temperature But because the air conditioning from the ceiling is fighting to grim death with the boiler heat from the windows.

47
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:30,417
Speaker 1: Why is there air conditioning?

48
00:03:30,457 --> 00:03:31,000
Speaker 1: that's on.

49
00:03:31,483 --> 00:03:32,529
Speaker 0: there's no way to turn it off.

50
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:35,877
Speaker 0: Really It's an old building now old.

51
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:36,780
Speaker 0: the Lincoln building is.

52
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,410
Speaker 1: yeah, but I mean usually each floor has like control.

53
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:46,669
Speaker 0: Yes, so we could turn it off thus ruining the entire rest of the floor, which is also all ours and making it too hot.

54
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:49,495
Speaker 1: You know, that's how it is.

55
00:03:49,816 --> 00:03:54,250
Speaker 0: No, so basically we've got this kind of like having to humidifier and a dehumidifier fighting.

56
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:59,966
Speaker 0: Wow, so as a result, there's like this constant whirlwind in the room.

57
00:03:59,986 --> 00:04:05,270
Speaker 1: It's better than our office Of a floor but there's one in control for the whole office, right?

58
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,730
Speaker 1: But basically it's a blower into a vent and then you can either get heat or cold out of this vent, right?

59
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:12,250
Speaker 1: But it's a long event with many openings.

60
00:04:12,693 --> 00:04:18,850
Speaker 1: It's like the end of the vent doesn't get blown out very much But the beginning of the vent gets a lot of pressure right because it's one long vent.

61
00:04:19,471 --> 00:04:24,911
Speaker 1: So if you sit like the way end of the vent the temperature is totally different than if you sit at the way beginning of The vent.

62
00:04:24,951 --> 00:04:32,947
Speaker 0: well, it didn't help that the one of the people in HR didn't like the fact that the vent in their office Which is also being renovated basically points at them from the ceiling.

63
00:04:32,987 --> 00:04:33,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, I hate that too.

64
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,090
Speaker 1: That's it's like you put a desk with a vent blowing at it.

65
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,410
Speaker 1: That's the worst because even if the air conditioner is set just right that person is wicked cold.

66
00:04:40,832 --> 00:04:43,224
Speaker 0: Not only that but the contacts dry out apparently.

67
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,189
Speaker 1: Yeah that too.

68
00:04:44,732 --> 00:04:49,110
Speaker 0: So she just put a piece of cardboard over it, but that increased the pressure on the rest of the floor.

69
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,542
Speaker 0: We're not allowed to do that.

70
00:04:51,563 --> 00:04:58,499
Speaker 0: Yes Let's because I have Two and a half computers under my desk, which are all kind of high-powered.

71
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:05,410
Speaker 0: They're being space heaters and because I'm up against the boiler heat My desk is basically a kotatsu.

72
00:05:06,891 --> 00:05:07,836
Speaker 0: It's kind of awesome.

73
00:05:07,856 --> 00:05:10,830
Speaker 1: Like I should go buy a kotatsu and bring it over everyone.

74
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:16,390
Speaker 0: But I kind of get like way under my desk in this giant leather chair that I also purloined from failed company.

75
00:05:16,591 --> 00:05:17,597
Speaker 1: I don't like leather chairs.

76
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:18,342
Speaker 1: It's not a fan neither.

77
00:05:18,382 --> 00:05:19,529
Speaker 0: Do I but leathers chair?

78
00:05:19,771 --> 00:05:23,090
Speaker 1: I guess if I had a leather freedom chair, you know as the material be okay.

79
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:25,826
Speaker 1: But I'm leather chair like the big cushy executive chairs.

80
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:31,300
Speaker 1: They suck They look impressive, but they don't Better than really cheap office chair.

81
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,022
Speaker 1: That is true.

82
00:05:32,343 --> 00:05:32,965
Speaker 1: That is true.

83
00:05:33,486 --> 00:05:34,790
Speaker 0: So that's what I got rocking.

84
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,538
Speaker 0: I basically my desk is a kotatsu.

85
00:05:36,679 --> 00:05:38,507
Speaker 0: I keep the Linux box that I don't use on.

86
00:05:38,527 --> 00:05:39,050
Speaker 1: apparently.

87
00:05:39,411 --> 00:05:43,450
Speaker 1: Did you see there's no law about like the temperature of a workplace?

88
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:47,506
Speaker 1: So there's a guy who's got like a pizza place and he's keeping it really easily.

89
00:05:47,526 --> 00:05:55,070
Speaker 1: turn the heat off Because the employees forgot to turn the heat off one night and so now there's just no heat for the employees and it's freezing cold.

90
00:05:55,393 --> 00:06:05,070
Speaker 1: awesome, yeah, but you know, so It's weird because you go to an office and everyone's always fighting over the temperature in most offices, but there's no law.

91
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:12,261
Speaker 1: They the boss could just say we're turning the heat off tough shit or we're turning the heat all the way up We're gonna melt you all fuckers like in the summer.

92
00:06:12,302 --> 00:06:13,387
Speaker 1: The boss could just turn the heat on.

93
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:14,576
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

94
00:06:14,818 --> 00:06:15,586
Speaker 1: Nothing you can do about it.

95
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:18,139
Speaker 0: Well, I remember a long time ago with the AC.

96
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:26,210
Speaker 0: we don't have anything important in the building obviously But the AC the supplementary AC to our tiny little like backup server room went out.

97
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,656
Speaker 0: So we just opened the door and it was fine.

98
00:06:28,917 --> 00:06:33,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, usually is of course then you're you know, negating the security of the door.

99
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:38,144
Speaker 0: Well the door I can see because the walls are all glass.

100
00:06:38,545 --> 00:06:38,966
Speaker 1: All right.

101
00:06:39,087 --> 00:06:42,798
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, so check this out right check in.

102
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:45,890
Speaker 1: All right, so I go to work this morning, right?

103
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,825
Speaker 1: And first I scrape off my car with the ice.

104
00:06:47,946 --> 00:06:50,970
Speaker 0: Oh my god There was like a centimeter and a half of ice on my car.

105
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:55,129
Speaker 0: I was I. basically I body slammed my door to knock enough ice off to open it.

106
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:57,277
Speaker 1: Yeah, that wasn't really wasn't necessary.

107
00:06:57,317 --> 00:07:01,390
Speaker 0: But I get up hours before you and I body slam was the only way into my car.

108
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,857
Speaker 0: I guess Bellybuster would have done it.

109
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:04,524
Speaker 1: I go to the choo-choo.

110
00:07:04,946 --> 00:07:09,990
Speaker 1: I get on the choo-choo I'm listening to something and sort of nap in a little bit, right?

111
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,861
Speaker 1: And I wake up to get off the choo-choo and you're still not at work.

112
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:18,557
Speaker 1: No, I'm starting to collect my things, you know and My head is not there.

113
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:21,030
Speaker 0: Did someone steal the head off your head?

114
00:07:21,891 --> 00:07:26,150
Speaker 1: I don't know if they took it from my head, but I I didn't even get off the train.

115
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:36,825
Speaker 1: I know I had it on the train for sure because there's no way I would have made it from my car to the train Without Realizing I would have died just without realizing my winter hat was not covering my ears.

116
00:07:36,885 --> 00:07:37,427
Speaker 0: It's too cold.

117
00:07:37,447 --> 00:07:38,250
Speaker 0: You just wouldn't have made it.

118
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:39,658
Speaker 1: Oh, I wouldn't I wouldn't wreck.

119
00:07:39,718 --> 00:07:41,267
Speaker 1: I would have known that I wasn't wearing it.

120
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,490
Speaker 0: Oh my god I almost didn't make it to the platform today.

121
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:47,025
Speaker 0: I was running late anyway, cuz I had to body slam my car open and you fell down.

122
00:07:47,547 --> 00:07:48,150
Speaker 0: I didn't fall down.

123
00:07:48,451 --> 00:07:52,027
Speaker 0: I didn't fall down once but I almost fell down like 15 times.

124
00:07:53,012 --> 00:07:55,061
Speaker 0: So and I have the worst thing is I get to the platform.

125
00:07:55,081 --> 00:07:56,046
Speaker 0: This guy's like watch the ice.

126
00:07:56,066 --> 00:07:56,729
Speaker 0: I'm like, whatever.

127
00:07:58,564 --> 00:08:05,266
Speaker 0: Okay And I refuse to slow down because that guy warned me and it was like dignity time.

128
00:08:05,286 --> 00:08:06,450
Speaker 0: I don't need your warning.

129
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,739
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wore my boots today said I'm a problem.

130
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,663
Speaker 1: But I was.

131
00:08:10,065 --> 00:08:11,130
Speaker 1: you know, I looked under the.

132
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,482
Speaker 1: I looked above the seat.

133
00:08:13,703 --> 00:08:14,950
Speaker 1: I looked in the adjacent seats.

134
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:22,589
Speaker 1: I looked above below around everywhere on the whole car and you know, the doors are gonna close and my hat was not there.

135
00:08:24,091 --> 00:08:26,965
Speaker 1: Someone must have taken it either from me or from my.

136
00:08:27,026 --> 00:08:29,154
Speaker 1: I don't know where they took it But it's it wasn't there.

137
00:08:29,395 --> 00:08:30,157
Speaker 1: So someone took it.

138
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:31,260
Speaker 0: I don't know.

139
00:08:31,381 --> 00:08:34,350
Speaker 0: I'm I'm leery of thinking that someone stole.

140
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,979
Speaker 1: I don't know they stole it, but they might have taken it.

141
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,323
Speaker 0: But why?

142
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,030
Speaker 1: maybe it was like attached to them.

143
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:40,797
Speaker 1: I mean it is wool.

144
00:08:40,857 --> 00:08:42,229
Speaker 1: It could have been a static cling deal.

145
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:48,070
Speaker 0: What so some like fat lady gets to work and she's got like four people's hats stuck to her gigantic gargantuan body.

146
00:08:48,171 --> 00:08:48,698
Speaker 0: I mean why?

147
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:55,010
Speaker 1: oh maybe you know It was just on the seat next to me and someone you know sat on it and maybe it got into their bag somehow.

148
00:08:55,994 --> 00:09:00,409
Speaker 1: How could that possibly have the same way that a bundle of wires gets tied up and knots on its own?

149
00:09:01,552 --> 00:09:03,990
Speaker 0: You put yeah, we've identified that first hand.

150
00:09:04,552 --> 00:09:09,470
Speaker 0: You know, we're gonna make a YouTube video of just a webcam of like Christmas lights in the closet.

151
00:09:09,793 --> 00:09:11,389
Speaker 1: Yeah, just roll them up real nice.

152
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,520
Speaker 1: Put them in the closet put a camera on there and just watch them.

153
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,868
Speaker 1: time, you know, do a stop-motion time-lapse.

154
00:09:18,214 --> 00:09:20,650
Speaker 0: I think the real issue is you have more than one kind of cable together.

155
00:09:20,751 --> 00:09:24,210
Speaker 0: Like I had a bunch of like pay-to-cables and a bunch of like USB and shit together.

156
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:29,627
Speaker 0: But I put one of my old scuzzy cables in there and like the next day those cables were done.

157
00:09:29,647 --> 00:09:32,010
Speaker 1: That sucks They're still tangled anyway.

158
00:09:33,012 --> 00:09:33,898
Speaker 1: So my hats gone.

159
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,890
Speaker 0: Well, do you have another hat?

160
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:37,874
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it kind of sucks.

161
00:09:37,894 --> 00:09:39,039
Speaker 1: That's why I bought that newer one.

162
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,967
Speaker 0: You wanna I got a backup hat.

163
00:09:41,067 --> 00:09:41,670
Speaker 0: It's terrible.

164
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:43,585
Speaker 0: No, it's my backup ski hat.

165
00:09:43,887 --> 00:09:50,946
Speaker 1: I think Dollar, I think if the if the Giants wins on Sunday, maybe I'll buy a Giants head.

166
00:09:51,027 --> 00:09:52,772
Speaker 0: Giants head Why not?

167
00:09:53,194 --> 00:09:54,117
Speaker 0: I don't know Sam.

168
00:09:54,157 --> 00:09:59,758
Speaker 0: by some anime head by like a Gurren Lagann kind of head It's not gonna have with ears coming out of it.

169
00:09:59,878 --> 00:10:03,110
Speaker 0: I can maybe a big square print of a character's face.

170
00:10:03,677 --> 00:10:14,190
Speaker 1: So also right You know work we did the secret Santa thing All right, and I bought chocolate because I decided I was you got to do something clever like when I worked at IBM.

171
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,467
Speaker 1: No one did anything clever because everyone clever was laid off.

172
00:10:19,431 --> 00:10:29,170
Speaker 0: Remember at IBM when I basically had a package full of liquor bottles But when they opened it all the liquor bottles were empty other than water and there was actually a bunch of anime DVDs in there.

173
00:10:30,131 --> 00:10:34,603
Speaker 0: Well, I just mean or the Unix an who gave a copy of the Star Wars Christmas special.

174
00:10:35,124 --> 00:10:35,866
Speaker 1: That's a good game.

175
00:10:35,906 --> 00:10:41,643
Speaker 1: But no so Someone got me a typical Best Buy gift card, right?

176
00:10:41,663 --> 00:10:43,470
Speaker 1: So I'm just like ah fuck, right?

177
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,608
Speaker 1: What am I supposed to buy with this?

178
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,663
Speaker 1: So I went to the Best Buy website and just sort of loached for like.

179
00:10:47,683 --> 00:10:50,753
Speaker 1: the first thing to buy and I bought this.

180
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:54,830
Speaker 1: there was a DS game for learning Japanese and the thing was the only one.

181
00:10:55,494 --> 00:10:57,910
Speaker 0: So that's what that game was you opened yesterday.

182
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:03,349
Speaker 1: So is it's like my Japanese coach is actually made by Ubisoft, which is a real game currently.

183
00:11:03,369 --> 00:11:04,982
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, it's published by Ubisoft.

184
00:11:05,002 --> 00:11:07,756
Speaker 1: It's made by Scanning something something.

185
00:11:07,776 --> 00:11:08,077
Speaker 1: I don't know.

186
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:15,040
Speaker 1: So I tried it out and It's terrible, it's good and bad at the same time.

187
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,162
Speaker 0: not learning Japanese.

188
00:11:16,283 --> 00:11:18,308
Speaker 1: I'm learning more than none.

189
00:11:18,628 --> 00:11:20,890
Speaker 0: Can you say You are shocked?

190
00:11:23,695 --> 00:11:28,695
Speaker 0: Can you say my name is Scott Boku?

191
00:11:29,037 --> 00:11:30,425
Speaker 1: I don't have to say name Boku.

192
00:11:30,465 --> 00:11:32,353
Speaker 0: No, not my Something.

193
00:11:32,373 --> 00:11:32,774
Speaker 1: so yeah.

194
00:11:33,135 --> 00:11:34,619
Speaker 0: No, but mostly say like Boku.

195
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:41,918
Speaker 1: Ah, I guess yeah, I know it taught me why and it didn't teach me What part of speech is why it's.

196
00:11:42,099 --> 00:11:45,168
Speaker 0: it's like something that doesn't exist in English, yeah, it's like a.

197
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:54,249
Speaker 1: It's sort of like an article but not you put it after the subject and before the whatever, okay Yeah, but no I so I'm doing.

198
00:11:55,572 --> 00:12:06,930
Speaker 1: I'm doing like the hiragata stuff right and it's like it shows you wanted It's like this is ah, and then it's like this is a Right, so I'm looking at him real careful like, you know.

199
00:12:07,432 --> 00:12:11,150
Speaker 1: And then it's like, okay, and then it gives you an ah, and it says trace this.

200
00:12:11,352 --> 00:12:13,049
Speaker 1: So I'm tracing it with the stylus, right?

201
00:12:13,731 --> 00:12:15,662
Speaker 1: And I'm like a high traced it with the stylus.

202
00:12:15,742 --> 00:12:25,692
Speaker 1: and then when you trace it with the stylus It says ah, and then you and then it fades to gray and it says trace it again And then it's white and it says, you know trace it again Right.

203
00:12:25,994 --> 00:12:28,610
Speaker 1: So I do it three times and I'm like, okay all good, right?

204
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:38,210
Speaker 1: Then you know it comes up and you go read a little bit more the lesson and then it's like, okay Here's a blank square draw ah, and it's like oh fuck.

205
00:12:40,451 --> 00:12:45,389
Speaker 1: Because when you're tracing it three times in a row you're just doing you know You do it you do it and then you do it one more time.

206
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:53,670
Speaker 0: But if they just give you a blank slate and they're like, ah, it's like oh, yeah Yeah, I remember when I was I got to start practicing again, especially if Emily and I are gonna go to Japan.

207
00:12:54,011 --> 00:13:01,889
Speaker 0: I got about halfway through learning my hiragata, but I got to a point where I could read it pretty quickly But I had a lot of trouble writing it.

208
00:13:02,271 --> 00:13:06,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, writing it and the worst part right is that this thing's complex thing I ever wrote was Gankutsu.

209
00:13:06,671 --> 00:13:12,710
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, the thing will teach you like, okay, here are all the tea ones like, you know, tate to date, right?

210
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:16,803
Speaker 1: I'll tell you today, too Yeah, but then it's like if you put the little quotation mark, it turns his daddy.

211
00:13:16,843 --> 00:13:18,168
Speaker 0: do they do know doesn't it?

212
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:18,389
Speaker 1: do G?

213
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,608
Speaker 1: I forget which one turns to G. I don't know tie goes to da anyway, right?

214
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:25,294
Speaker 1: It's like it's.

215
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,490
Speaker 1: it just tells you that like on one sentence.

216
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:31,325
Speaker 1: It's like oh, yeah By the way, if you put the quotation mark, it changes them all to the other letter.

217
00:13:31,345 --> 00:13:32,410
Speaker 0: that makes it really easy.

218
00:13:32,651 --> 00:13:35,500
Speaker 1: It does make it easy, but you never practice.

219
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:40,989
Speaker 1: It never does the practice test things with that other letter So you don't actually like learn them.

220
00:13:41,911 --> 00:13:47,990
Speaker 1: And then it's like when you're when you're doing the practice things like the letters real big like it takes up almost the whole screen.

221
00:13:48,612 --> 00:13:54,130
Speaker 1: But when you've got like the smaller font size, you can barely see if that little quotation mark is there or not.

222
00:13:55,193 --> 00:13:56,649
Speaker 1: So it's it's a little bit rough.

223
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:09,030
Speaker 1: It's sort of like it feels like someone sort of just threw it together rather than actually, you know scientifically and using education Knowledges to make something that is easy to learn.

224
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:14,790
Speaker 0: Maybe we should go with the the you know Expensive lazy option and just buy one of those Rosetta's no stone things.

225
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:15,254
Speaker 0: The thing

226
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:28,789
Speaker 1: is the way the Rosetta stone thing works at least from what I heard and what I saw a guy using it on the train to learn Hebrew right is it gives you Like all these pictures and then it gives you the word and you got to click on the right picture That goes with the word or vice-versa.

227
00:14:29,553 --> 00:14:31,580
Speaker 1: It sort of works like that from what I saw.

228
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,323
Speaker 0: I don't like that.

229
00:14:32,343 --> 00:14:38,745
Speaker 1: Okay, so I don't know if that's worth Whatever they charge for the stupid Rosetta stone.

230
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:41,343
Speaker 1: This was $30.

231
00:14:41,343 --> 00:14:44,058
Speaker 0: so Yeah, all right.

232
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:44,943
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll try it out.

233
00:14:44,963 --> 00:14:46,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, I want to see this thing.

234
00:14:46,295 --> 00:15:02,610
Speaker 1: Yeah The thing is that does have like a lot like if you actually go through with this thing It might not be like the best at learning and you might have to just sort of you know Force yourself to do a lot of the stuff that you know, it doesn't help you out with but eventually it teaches like a whole shit.

235
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:05,610
Speaker 1: Ton of kanji are in that little DS cartridge apparently.

236
00:15:06,214 --> 00:15:12,121
Speaker 0: So anyway, there is actually some anime news here And I actually want to talk about it because I didn't notice that.

237
00:15:12,483 --> 00:15:17,520
Speaker 0: I didn't know there were rumors about this Until I saw rumors confirmed.

238
00:15:17,681 --> 00:15:20,270
Speaker 1: That's cuz we don't read like anime forums and shit.

239
00:15:20,431 --> 00:15:34,410
Speaker 0: Well, pretty much if anime news network is the AP wire Here I go, yeah, but turns out Koji Masanari who was the director of One of my favorite shows ever read or die the OAV that not the TV the manga?

240
00:15:34,671 --> 00:15:36,699
Speaker 0: Well, no, he I think he also directed the TV.

241
00:15:37,301 --> 00:15:39,269
Speaker 0: Okay, but I can't really blame him for that.

242
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,478
Speaker 0: Anyway, read or die.

243
00:15:41,518 --> 00:15:46,235
Speaker 0: if you have not seen the read or die OAV Three episode OAV.

244
00:15:46,376 --> 00:15:47,822
Speaker 0: right the title tells you what it's about.

245
00:15:47,942 --> 00:15:49,067
Speaker 0: read or die.

246
00:15:50,231 --> 00:15:52,438
Speaker 1: Then should we should name our book club?

247
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:53,661
Speaker 0: that I think we should.

248
00:15:53,681 --> 00:15:54,424
Speaker 0: it is so.

249
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,947
Speaker 0: so it has been said and so it shall be done.

250
00:15:57,911 --> 00:16:03,990
Speaker 0: Read or die is one of the most epically full of win things ever made the OAV at least.

251
00:16:04,111 --> 00:16:07,850
Speaker 0: Yes, it is epic in a way that is hard to describe.

252
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:14,149
Speaker 0: It is a show where a character will create a gigantic paper airplane and then you will all write it.

253
00:16:14,531 --> 00:16:19,339
Speaker 0: But yet it is neither Comical nor undramatic that this has happened.

254
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:21,705
Speaker 0: And in fact instead of thinking what the fuck you're thinking.

255
00:16:21,725 --> 00:16:24,488
Speaker 0: Oh my god Is that awesome?

256
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:30,409
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, they're fighting against you know, freaking like Goku on his cloud with an extending stick.

257
00:16:33,442 --> 00:16:37,982
Speaker 0: But anyway Apparently he is making his first feature film.

258
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,510
Speaker 0: It is going to be called the space show.

259
00:16:41,355 --> 00:16:42,450
Speaker 1: Sounds good to me now.

260
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:49,150
Speaker 0: That's the kind of title that leads me to believe it'll be similar to read or die in terms of how awesome it is.

261
00:16:49,431 --> 00:16:49,956
Speaker 1: I hope so.

262
00:16:50,238 --> 00:16:51,024
Speaker 0: I really hope so.

263
00:16:51,045 --> 00:16:51,609
Speaker 0: I don't know.

264
00:16:53,051 --> 00:16:56,730
Speaker 1: Anyway, there aren't a lot of anime full-length features these days anyway.

265
00:16:56,851 --> 00:17:00,190
Speaker 1: So anyone that you know, like it anyone at all?

266
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,439
Speaker 1: I'll take what I can get as long as it's not like another Pokemon movie.

267
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,261
Speaker 0: Yeah.

268
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:14,650
Speaker 0: Oh, he did do a read or die TV And he did storyboards for bunt openers and enders and I that's not so bad and he produced it.

269
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,219
Speaker 1: He's fully responsible for the travesty.

270
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,127
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at the same time it Probably made money.

271
00:17:23,111 --> 00:17:23,814
Speaker 1: Maybe I don't know.

272
00:17:23,894 --> 00:17:25,662
Speaker 0: I watched it all the way through really.

273
00:17:25,682 --> 00:17:27,147
Speaker 0: I was living alone.

274
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:27,429
Speaker 0: I'd nothing.

275
00:17:28,453 --> 00:17:28,954
Speaker 0: I also.

276
00:17:29,275 --> 00:17:34,995
Speaker 0: that was the era of my life when I didn't even have internet access or a cell phone that worked because I lived on that mountain.

277
00:17:35,016 --> 00:17:39,178
Speaker 0: I watched a Gunslinger girls at about the same time.

278
00:17:39,198 --> 00:17:41,185
Speaker 1: Did they have cable television up there?

279
00:17:41,205 --> 00:17:42,067
Speaker 1: No satellite?

280
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:46,250
Speaker 0: not well We didn't have satellite at the house, but you couldn't get cable even if you wanted to buy.

281
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:49,684
Speaker 0: I was renting some rich lady's house and she was never there.

282
00:17:50,206 --> 00:17:51,290
Speaker 0: So it was basically her house.

283
00:17:51,391 --> 00:17:53,730
Speaker 0: I watched every DVD she owned which wasn't that many.

284
00:17:56,234 --> 00:18:01,421
Speaker 1: If only I had Netflix in those days, I know oh My god that said the DVD bag.

285
00:18:01,462 --> 00:18:13,430
Speaker 0: like all three back every day I would drive a half-hour down the mountain and park at this elementary school and sit in the parking lot on the top of The slide where I got cell service and call people in my boredom.

286
00:18:13,571 --> 00:18:22,210
Speaker 0: So yes, I watched all of read or die TV and all of gunslinger girls And if only you had had like, you know, something like coke don't okay in those days.

287
00:18:22,271 --> 00:18:24,249
Speaker 0: Oh my god You realize during that time?

288
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:30,708
Speaker 0: That is when I got all s ranks on everything I could in both of the original GBA advanced wars.

289
00:18:30,728 --> 00:18:35,320
Speaker 1: All right Anyway So, you know Hatsune Miku, right?

290
00:18:36,023 --> 00:18:46,963
Speaker 0: In fact because of Emily I've got the Hatsune Miku mixing box including the DVD and the chibi little PVC staring what's on the DVD bunch of stuff.

291
00:18:46,983 --> 00:18:48,730
Speaker 0: I haven't really fully explored explored it yet.

292
00:18:49,011 --> 00:19:00,290
Speaker 1: It's not the software so don't think that yeah, but basically I found out Basically from this anime news network article that there are things I didn't know right this yo Yamaha's Vocaloid software engine, right?

293
00:19:00,872 --> 00:19:06,009
Speaker 1: And that's the thing that lets you do this sort of typing lyrics and notes and making someone sing it.

294
00:19:06,804 --> 00:19:15,636
Speaker 1: but This other company Krypton right is basically what they do is they make sort of like voice samples for Vocaloid.

295
00:19:15,676 --> 00:19:31,545
Speaker 1: so it's not Yamaha that's doing these character things it's Krypton is making these character things that you sort of put into Vocaloid so that you you know and You know they get sort of like famous people to are very talented people to do them like.

296
00:19:31,565 --> 00:19:36,770
Speaker 1: there's a there's a gak poid I think it says here right, you know done by gak and whatever.

297
00:19:37,595 --> 00:19:43,367
Speaker 1: so They got There's a new character for their new one, right?

298
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:48,090
Speaker 1: So this is the third one because it was Hatsune Miku then it was those twins, right?

299
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,898
Speaker 1: And now it's the third one.

300
00:19:49,918 --> 00:19:54,534
Speaker 1: The third one is named Megarin Luca.

301
00:19:56,316 --> 00:20:04,330
Speaker 1: She doesn't look as hot as Hatsune Miku as far as I'm concerned but She is done by Yuu Asakawa.

302
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:16,863
Speaker 1: They had her do the voicing for it and there's a couple demo songs You can listen to like Amazing Grace and some other song and it sounds okay But it still sounds like Vocaloid, you know, it's.

303
00:20:17,525 --> 00:20:23,230
Speaker 1: it is what it is And I'm sure that if people like this character, they'll be flood of internet stuff.

304
00:20:24,091 --> 00:20:27,283
Speaker 1: Really I think the problem with this character at least that is the visit.

305
00:20:27,344 --> 00:20:29,392
Speaker 1: the graphical design of it Is.

306
00:20:29,432 --> 00:20:40,070
Speaker 1: it's more like a Square Enix character where there's a lot of stuff on her, you know It's like she's got the boots with a lot of laces and then a sock leg thingy and then a you know an armband.

307
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,818
Speaker 0: Miku isn't super complex.

308
00:20:42,838 --> 00:20:48,140
Speaker 0: She's got what the tie and the long sleeves and the big hair Yeah, it's mostly the tie is like the only real accessory.

309
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,950
Speaker 1: This girl's got like two belts and a bunch of neck shit.

310
00:20:52,675 --> 00:21:00,247
Speaker 1: No one should have that many belts Yeah, but yeah, I guess we'll see if this character becomes as popular as Hatsune Miku.

311
00:21:00,267 --> 00:21:05,569
Speaker 1: I doubt it, but Maybe I maybe people would be able to make like better music with her voice.

312
00:21:06,874 --> 00:21:10,788
Speaker 0: I don't really want to go through it all because if you care, you'll just go to a website and read the list.

313
00:21:10,828 --> 00:21:16,743
Speaker 0: but The the anime industry is recovering from the I guess crash it had earlier.

314
00:21:16,763 --> 00:21:19,150
Speaker 1: Well, no, it's not the industry's not recovering.

315
00:21:19,672 --> 00:21:22,907
Speaker 0: The industry is consolidating which is the closest thing to recovering.

316
00:21:22,927 --> 00:21:26,457
Speaker 1: we're gonna see So more like spoils of war.

317
00:21:26,698 --> 00:21:33,843
Speaker 0: so a lot of good titles that got lost You know genie on titles are being picked back up mostly by one funimation.

318
00:21:34,104 --> 00:21:35,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, but funimation just had big layoffs.

319
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,350
Speaker 0: Well that think about it lay a bunch of people off, right?

320
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:52,698
Speaker 0: So now I have a lot fewer people to pay, you know, really contract my operations Pick up a whole bunch of already put together titles and just re-release them in thin packs super cheap to build capital and wait out the bad times.

321
00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:58,223
Speaker 1: Oh Wait, it says they laid off at least two people from funimation North America.

322
00:21:58,243 --> 00:22:00,008
Speaker 0: That was probably like 60% of their staff.

323
00:22:01,292 --> 00:22:02,315
Speaker 1: Yeah, it says last.

324
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,141
Speaker 1: it says a while ago in July.

325
00:22:04,181 --> 00:22:05,685
Speaker 1: They cut staff by 10%.

326
00:22:05,685 --> 00:22:07,170
Speaker 1: so now they got two more people.

327
00:22:07,471 --> 00:22:12,888
Speaker 0: Oh, I totally didn't realize that Koji Masunari was the director for the miko 2010 anime.

328
00:22:14,452 --> 00:22:17,221
Speaker 1: Oh, dude, miko 2010 is like the wind miko 2010.

329
00:22:17,221 --> 00:22:18,705
Speaker 1: It's not the manga though.

330
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:27,018
Speaker 1: No the manga porn porn but the anime Hilarious not poor god.

331
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:29,609
Speaker 0: We watched that when we were freshmen at our IT.

332
00:22:29,991 --> 00:22:41,142
Speaker 1: It's basically a story about a sex bot that gets a job at working at a radio station as like you know the host of a talk show but in The manga she's a sex bot and she's sexting it up.

333
00:22:41,202 --> 00:22:45,187
Speaker 1: But in the in the show She's a sex bot but she never sexes it up.

334
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,434
Speaker 1: So it's it's just that comedy.

335
00:22:47,454 --> 00:22:55,038
Speaker 0: Didn't we only get to watch that because the tape Nazi basically translated it himself From the SVHS masters like that.

336
00:22:55,058 --> 00:22:59,810
Speaker 0: he got from a friend in Japan and he showed it only to the RIT anime club And he wouldn't give it to anyone.

337
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:00,473
Speaker 1: Let's see if I can.

338
00:23:00,533 --> 00:23:01,457
Speaker 1: I guess I'm gonna have to.

339
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:04,230
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's gonna be available on any bid torrents or anything.

340
00:23:04,834 --> 00:23:05,337
Speaker 1: I wonder if any.

341
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,685
Speaker 1: I just looked at a couple.

342
00:23:06,705 --> 00:23:07,289
Speaker 1: I didn't see it.

343
00:23:07,591 --> 00:23:09,470
Speaker 0: I'll have to look cuz someone else had to have done it.

344
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:13,283
Speaker 0: Otherwise we have to track down the tape Nazi and steal his SVHS.

345
00:23:13,544 --> 00:23:14,046
Speaker 1: Yeah, great.

346
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:15,310
Speaker 1: That's what we need an SVHS.

347
00:23:16,932 --> 00:23:17,877
Speaker 1: That'll be real useful.

348
00:23:18,621 --> 00:23:22,236
Speaker 0: and I guess one more thing I've got We're not gonna really review it yet.

349
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:32,798
Speaker 0: Obviously because one it deserves a full review - I don't feel like we need to review it before any of you have seen it because the Summed-up review is see it.

350
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:33,881
Speaker 0: It's fantastic.

351
00:23:33,922 --> 00:23:44,612
Speaker 0: But Miyazaki's new movie ponyo by the sea We uh, we acquired an advanced copy and we watched it and it is absolutely Amazing.

352
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:45,836
Speaker 0: like if you didn't like howls.

353
00:23:46,819 --> 00:23:50,169
Speaker 0: it kind of goes back to what makes Miyazaki movies.

354
00:23:50,369 --> 00:23:52,617
Speaker 0: Awesome It is so awesome.

355
00:23:52,978 --> 00:23:54,905
Speaker 0: Like I I'm not gonna even say anything else.

356
00:23:55,366 --> 00:23:56,430
Speaker 0: if you can see it see it.

357
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,570
Speaker 0: It's gonna get a theatrical release in the US.

358
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:04,949
Speaker 0: So if you live in any major city, you will definitely be able to see it in a theater And it is definitely worth seeing in a theater.

359
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:06,234
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty good.

360
00:24:06,274 --> 00:24:08,763
Speaker 1: But it's not like the most amazing Miyazaki movie ever.

361
00:24:08,823 --> 00:24:10,830
Speaker 0: No, it's not but it's a fantastic movie.

362
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:11,412
Speaker 1: It's all right.

363
00:24:11,955 --> 00:24:12,396
Speaker 0: All right.

364
00:24:12,698 --> 00:24:14,565
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would call it fantastic.

365
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:15,630
Speaker 1: It didn't blow me away.

366
00:24:16,292 --> 00:24:17,656
Speaker 0: All right, I would say it was.

367
00:24:18,277 --> 00:24:19,902
Speaker 0: I mean it had lots of cubies.

368
00:24:20,384 --> 00:24:21,808
Speaker 1: I was better than howls moving castle.

369
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:25,101
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure That's not saying much how.

370
00:24:25,121 --> 00:24:25,764
Speaker 0: this was pretty good.

371
00:24:25,784 --> 00:24:31,228
Speaker 1: I think the only problem now I think like howls moving castle like without Calcifer the talking fire.

372
00:24:31,288 --> 00:24:31,810
Speaker 1: It had nothing.

373
00:24:32,312 --> 00:24:38,969
Speaker 0: I think the problem with howls was that it had too much Unexplained stuff from the book that you wouldn't know what was going on unless you read the book.

374
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:41,297
Speaker 1: That's true like in Pawnee.

375
00:24:41,317 --> 00:24:45,650
Speaker 0: Oh the the few unexplained things don't really matter at all to what you're watching.

376
00:24:46,293 --> 00:24:47,839
Speaker 1: I didn't think anything was unexplained.

377
00:24:48,562 --> 00:25:01,841
Speaker 1: I just thought it was sort of it was like Pawnee by the sea was like a shorter story that felt like it was extended with like lots of scenes of you know, just Awesome animations and cool things going on, but you know not.

378
00:25:01,902 --> 00:25:02,283
Speaker 1: it was like it.

379
00:25:02,343 --> 00:25:04,529
Speaker 1: the plot was actually very short and simple.

380
00:25:05,372 --> 00:25:08,223
Speaker 0: No, I really liked it and you'll be able to see in the theater.

381
00:25:08,263 --> 00:25:09,930
Speaker 0: So hold out if you live in a city.

382
00:25:10,331 --> 00:25:11,336
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll review it.

383
00:25:11,496 --> 00:25:11,978
Speaker 1: I liked it.

384
00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:14,610
Speaker 1: I just didn't think it was like, oh my god amazing spirit of ways.

385
00:25:14,731 --> 00:25:15,577
Speaker 1: Oh my god amazing.

386
00:25:15,617 --> 00:25:15,859
Speaker 1: Yeah.

387
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:25,643
Speaker 0: All right, so other than Spirited or other than all the other Miyazaki movies An animated feature that has come out recently.

388
00:25:25,663 --> 00:25:27,470
Speaker 0: that was better paprika.

389
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:29,717
Speaker 0: How recent was that though?

390
00:25:29,738 --> 00:25:31,245
Speaker 0: a couple years couple years?

391
00:25:31,306 --> 00:25:31,869
Speaker 0: Is that recent?

392
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:33,376
Speaker 1: What do you quit?

393
00:25:33,558 --> 00:25:38,020
Speaker 1: Okay, so if you're gonna Say compared to anything that came out.

394
00:25:38,322 --> 00:25:47,628
Speaker 0: It's the best thing in the last five minutes Plus, I think I could put it in the top 15 or 20 anime features Maybe top 50.

395
00:25:47,628 --> 00:25:47,910
Speaker 0: I don't know.

396
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:51,171
Speaker 0: Maybe I'm thinking 15 or 20 when I think back to all the anime movies I've seen.

397
00:25:51,211 --> 00:25:54,000
Speaker 0: a lot of them are fun, but vampire hunter D.

398
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,444
Speaker 1: It's like sky crawlers more.

399
00:25:56,086 --> 00:25:57,310
Speaker 0: I like sky crawlers a lot.

400
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,933
Speaker 0: Consider them fairly equal.

401
00:26:00,193 --> 00:26:04,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess one was more enjoyable, but one had a lot more interesting things to say.

402
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,829
Speaker 0: I Think you can figure out which one was which people.

403
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:17,373
Speaker 0: Anyway, the movie is great and it kind of reverses the trend of how and I think goes back toward more Miyazaki ish roots.

404
00:26:17,955 --> 00:26:20,863
Speaker 0: Yeah, plus it definitely in the opening bits has the.

405
00:26:20,883 --> 00:26:22,408
Speaker 0: yeah, it's Miyazaki.

406
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:24,293
Speaker 0: pollution's bad We know let's go.

407
00:26:24,313 --> 00:26:25,255
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

408
00:26:25,977 --> 00:26:30,870
Speaker 1: He also really really likes to do like swarms of shit, especially if it's blobby shit.

409
00:26:31,253 --> 00:26:33,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I kind of like doing that a lot.

410
00:26:33,371 --> 00:26:39,717
Speaker 0: I like how the blobs of sea water are kind of like he did it in Princess Mononoke Did it in spirited away did in this movie?

411
00:26:39,737 --> 00:26:43,950
Speaker 1: Just you know, lots of you know move lots of moving swarms of blobs.

412
00:26:44,493 --> 00:26:46,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, meanwhile shiro not so many blobs.

413
00:26:47,495 --> 00:26:49,410
Speaker 1: No shiro is not really about the blobs.

414
00:26:49,591 --> 00:26:53,210
Speaker 0: It's mostly people sitting quietly while being oppressed by their own existence.

415
00:26:54,255 --> 00:26:55,369
Speaker 1: Are you talking about oshi?

416
00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:06,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, it was like shiro doesn't have blobs, but then I was like, I admit it I was talking about she but there's so intertwined in my mind because it goes in the shell that I kept saying shiro.

417
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:07,073
Speaker 0: now I'm an oshi.

418
00:27:07,435 --> 00:27:10,590
Speaker 0: shiro has blobs, but they're blobs of a different source.

419
00:27:17,281 --> 00:27:20,936
Speaker 0: So anyway things of the day this has nothing to do with anime.

420
00:27:20,957 --> 00:27:21,499
Speaker 0: How about yours?

421
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,466
Speaker 0: Comics awesome good enough.

422
00:27:25,546 --> 00:27:27,535
Speaker 0: I'll go first then because mine is totally irrelevant.

423
00:27:27,555 --> 00:27:39,460
Speaker 0: It's a video by some guy at RIT about how to take a shower at RIT and I bring it up only because he makes a couple of good jokes, but I realized why this video was made.

424
00:27:40,264 --> 00:27:56,719
Speaker 0: It was a project for freshman year in Richmond or FYE which at RIT is a class that they added when we got there as freshmen and The reason for the class is to teach people who suck How to not fail and moving out of their parents house.

425
00:27:57,422 --> 00:28:01,240
Speaker 0: It is like the worst class ever and if you don't take it you don't graduate.

426
00:28:01,987 --> 00:28:03,340
Speaker 0: It's not even worth any credits.

427
00:28:03,661 --> 00:28:04,665
Speaker 0: You just have to pass.

428
00:28:04,905 --> 00:28:09,020
Speaker 0: you have to attend it and not be flunked in it, but the grade doesn't count for your GPA.

429
00:28:09,503 --> 00:28:10,430
Speaker 1: I remember that class.

430
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,700
Speaker 1: that class was a joke.

431
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:15,592
Speaker 0: The class was like if you're gonna have sex use a condom.

432
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:18,200
Speaker 0: if you're gonna drink don't drink until you puke.

433
00:28:19,262 --> 00:28:21,289
Speaker 0: If you get a credit card don't spend all your money.

434
00:28:21,691 --> 00:28:22,594
Speaker 0: Here's how to shower.

435
00:28:22,795 --> 00:28:24,000
Speaker 0: Here's why you should shower.

436
00:28:24,721 --> 00:28:25,889
Speaker 0: Here's how to go to class.

437
00:28:26,091 --> 00:28:27,138
Speaker 1: I barely remember it.

438
00:28:28,023 --> 00:28:32,460
Speaker 0: I kind of remember it because I actually it was mine was in the dorms and it was on a Friday.

439
00:28:32,561 --> 00:28:34,331
Speaker 1: I was also in the dorms in that room.

440
00:28:34,371 --> 00:28:37,265
Speaker 1: That was at the bottom of What building.

441
00:28:37,326 --> 00:28:37,688
Speaker 1: was it?

442
00:28:37,728 --> 00:28:39,499
Speaker 1: the one right near the ATM machine?

443
00:28:40,421 --> 00:28:43,854
Speaker 1: ATM not ATM machine and the one we played board games in a few times.

444
00:28:44,236 --> 00:28:45,260
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, it was in that room.

445
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:54,939
Speaker 0: It was the only class at every RIT I ever had on the dorm side and it was only class I ever had at RIT on a Friday because I didn't get to pick it and I couldn't get out of it.

446
00:28:55,341 --> 00:28:59,540
Speaker 1: No, it's right near the the ResNet whatever room, you know what I'm talking about.

447
00:28:59,881 --> 00:29:07,600
Speaker 0: So one thing I would like to point out is that when his little shower caddy falls off the thing That's because those things were designed to not hold anything up.

448
00:29:07,901 --> 00:29:11,877
Speaker 0: they would fall down if you put more than like a pound's worth of even a half a pound of weight on him.

449
00:29:12,178 --> 00:29:12,700
Speaker 1: Wow and

450
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:27,373
Speaker 0: Because RIT showers were like that and because I had nothing better and because I suddenly remembered how disgusted I was at the majority of people entering RIT and colleges in general Who kind of needed a class like that because as I would like to point out

451
00:29:27,613 --> 00:29:28,757
Speaker 1: that's the funny says the thing.

452
00:29:28,777 --> 00:29:31,709
Speaker 1: this video is Sort of a stupid YouTube video whatever.

453
00:29:32,111 --> 00:29:42,400
Speaker 1: but the thing that makes this video Powerful is that you just think of watch it realizing there are seriously no joke people who need this video.

454
00:29:42,924 --> 00:29:44,496
Speaker 1: Otherwise, they won't know what to do.

455
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:50,923
Speaker 0: one time I went to the shower guy was just standing in the bathroom naked trying to dry himself with that hand dryer Really?

456
00:29:51,245 --> 00:29:54,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, one time I found poop in one of the showers.

457
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:55,904
Speaker 0: Awesome.

458
00:29:55,984 --> 00:29:58,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know how many time one?

459
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,780
Speaker 0: You know how many times people would be in there barefoot and then like a month later, they would totally have funguses.

460
00:30:04,781 --> 00:30:08,334
Speaker 1: That was the funniest part where he said yeah one guy would go in without flip-flops.

461
00:30:08,454 --> 00:30:09,899
Speaker 1: They'll have fungus up to his kneecaps.

462
00:30:12,122 --> 00:30:20,879
Speaker 0: That's kind of lame but you know what that That video was not a joke to at least a third of the people who took my freshman year in Richmond class with me.

463
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,390
Speaker 0: Wow, these were people who would like seriously my class.

464
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:25,815
Speaker 1: last two quarters also.

465
00:30:25,835 --> 00:30:26,256
Speaker 1: Yes.

466
00:30:26,276 --> 00:30:33,362
Speaker 0: Yeah like in the middle of class They would ask like we'd have the little Q&A at the end where we could like ask anything about RIT and one kid was Like.

467
00:30:33,985 --> 00:30:36,880
Speaker 0: so, how do I like not fail out of class?

468
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:41,316
Speaker 0: Like I keep going to class, but I'm just not doing really well and like what do I do?

469
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,623
Speaker 1: Be smart.

470
00:30:47,007 --> 00:30:49,315
Speaker 0: so the teachers like all right, so, uh, do you study?

471
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:50,980
Speaker 0: he's like, yeah, well, I didn't really buy any of the books.

472
00:30:54,282 --> 00:30:55,448
Speaker 0: Do you go to class?

473
00:30:55,529 --> 00:30:56,333
Speaker 0: he's like like try to.

474
00:30:56,354 --> 00:31:03,539
Speaker 0: yeah You know what that kid wasn't in the second half of freshman year in Richmond because he totally failed out of RIT.

475
00:31:05,603 --> 00:31:06,287
Speaker 0: Good.

476
00:31:06,328 --> 00:31:08,040
Speaker 1: Yeah his money paid for your education.

477
00:31:08,401 --> 00:31:13,500
Speaker 0: It was either that or I was gonna use the videos of the riot at RIT because I found those suddenly out of the blue.

478
00:31:14,912 --> 00:31:20,965
Speaker 1: so Quite often me and other people, you know yell about hey Monthly.

479
00:31:21,126 --> 00:31:22,332
Speaker 1: comic books are stupid.

480
00:31:22,393 --> 00:31:23,760
Speaker 1: We should get rid of them, right?

481
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,886
Speaker 1: Why do we still have these stupid little pamphlets?

482
00:31:26,247 --> 00:31:32,440
Speaker 1: and why are they raising the price of the pamphlets from 350 to $4?

483
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:44,355
Speaker 0: probably because the market for Comics in that form is contracting due to the fact that the majority of those comics are marketed at it Increasingly shrinking due to old age and death demographic of people who must buy them all.

484
00:31:44,696 --> 00:31:44,917
Speaker 1: Yeah.

485
00:31:45,459 --> 00:31:51,039
Speaker 1: Anyway, So here is an editorial on a blog on news or Amma.

486
00:31:52,401 --> 00:31:55,714
Speaker 1: And basically it's a guy saying we should kill the monthly, right?

487
00:31:55,934 --> 00:31:57,380
Speaker 0: We should let me guess.

488
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,212
Speaker 0: Is your thing of the day the comments of people replying to this?

489
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:09,379
Speaker 1: Well, the comments are okay, too, but basically, the thing is that he brings up a point that is Interesting and somewhat new and that is why it's a thing of the day.

490
00:32:10,343 --> 00:32:17,841
Speaker 1: mostly the big point he brings up is that Putting out, you know, even if you excuse the format and the price or whatever right.

491
00:32:18,383 --> 00:32:38,060
Speaker 1: the idea of coming out with a small amount of comic every single month like Only works if you're you know Marvel or DC that doesn't work for anyone else, you know for anyone else like being you know Just coming out with a pamphlet that is of comic every month doesn't do it.

492
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,424
Speaker 1: I mean who?

493
00:32:39,584 --> 00:32:52,723
Speaker 1: who really out there writes like serial stories that can be told in incredibly small Installments at four dollars apiece besides Marvel and DC with their superhero soap operas Nobody.

494
00:32:53,467 --> 00:32:54,252
Speaker 1: so it's like.

495
00:32:55,197 --> 00:33:16,100
Speaker 1: it's like yeah I guess you know the fact that because that format is there and all these other people are somewhat forced to buy into that format even though it doesn't match the art they are creating, you know, it's sort of like if All these painters were forced to use like a small canvas when they're to like and then you know They were actually making really big paintings.

496
00:33:16,181 --> 00:33:19,260
Speaker 1: You had to sort of put all these little small canvases together to get the big painting.

497
00:33:19,701 --> 00:33:21,266
Speaker 1: It's like now that's it's.

498
00:33:21,386 --> 00:33:25,439
Speaker 1: it only works for the people making small paintings, which there are only two of all right, huh?

499
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,743
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right.

500
00:33:27,306 --> 00:33:27,627
Speaker 0: I don't know.

501
00:33:27,868 --> 00:33:30,500
Speaker 0: I didn't need any more reasons to dislike the business model.

502
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:38,751
Speaker 1: No, but honestly there are a shit ton of comments that are sort of they range from like yeah Fuck the monthly to all.

503
00:33:38,792 --> 00:33:39,940
Speaker 1: the monthly will always be here.

504
00:33:41,761 --> 00:33:51,918
Speaker 0: So when we were at our IT, I want to make you all realize how old we are compared to half of you But at the same time how young we are compared to the other half of you.

505
00:33:52,903 --> 00:33:59,859
Speaker 0: There were no Digital fan subs like what that came about in the course of us being at our IT like when we got to our IT.

506
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:00,803
Speaker 0: Well, there were none.

507
00:34:00,823 --> 00:34:07,191
Speaker 1: Well think about this everything in my senior year of high school Watching like a Kira on a VHS, right?

508
00:34:07,492 --> 00:34:09,339
Speaker 1: I own freshman year of our IT.

509
00:34:09,942 --> 00:34:17,271
Speaker 1: DVDs started to get popular but like people were buying Ps2s which were brand new to get the DVD player.

510
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:20,179
Speaker 1: Yes DVD standalone DVD players were so expensive.

511
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,467
Speaker 0: We think about this when we got to our IT.

512
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:26,279
Speaker 0: None of us had DVD players because those were a crazy extravagance.

513
00:34:26,701 --> 00:34:28,330
Speaker 1: I know one had a DVD ROM either.

514
00:34:28,571 --> 00:34:32,246
Speaker 0: I had a DVD ROM but whoa So old, you know.

515
00:34:32,266 --> 00:34:38,873
Speaker 0: because they were expensive it could only play single-layer discs Because I couldn't afford DVDs.

516
00:34:39,337 --> 00:34:41,545
Speaker 0: I didn't have any Right.

517
00:34:41,607 --> 00:34:44,899
Speaker 1: So we were buying anime on VHS, right?

518
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:50,052
Speaker 1: The like I think greasy can had some anime on DVD.

519
00:34:50,072 --> 00:34:52,500
Speaker 1: that was like insane try gun on DVD, which is crazy.

520
00:34:52,641 --> 00:34:54,409
Speaker 1: I was like, oh my god, it's on DVD the store.

521
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:55,033
Speaker 1: Holy shit.

522
00:34:55,072 --> 00:34:56,320
Speaker 1: I didn't realize that right?

523
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,224
Speaker 0: Well, not even that.

524
00:34:57,264 --> 00:34:59,714
Speaker 0: but it was that there were no like we did.

525
00:34:59,734 --> 00:35:01,060
Speaker 0: there weren't DVDs available to us.

526
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:08,780
Speaker 0: We have DVD players and there were no digi subs like the first digi subs Like we're that year like the eskaflowne movie was one of them.

527
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,904
Speaker 0: And even then there was like contra.

528
00:35:09,964 --> 00:35:10,385
Speaker 0: I had.

529
00:35:10,406 --> 00:35:14,620
Speaker 1: I had real media files of try gone on my hotline sir.

530
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:15,183
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

531
00:35:15,204 --> 00:35:15,647
Speaker 0: Those are like 120i.

532
00:35:15,667 --> 00:35:19,244
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was How he watched it.

533
00:35:19,345 --> 00:35:27,061
Speaker 1: All right, and I was getting tapes out of the VHS tapes from the club See checking them out regularly now This.

534
00:35:27,101 --> 00:35:28,244
Speaker 0: is it that the thing?

535
00:35:28,264 --> 00:35:32,960
Speaker 0: that may it was hard to get into anime if you weren't already into anime at that time.

536
00:35:33,081 --> 00:35:43,405
Speaker 0: But being at the RIT anime club in RIT they had like 400 or so VHS tapes of Fan subs fan subs.

537
00:35:43,665 --> 00:35:45,330
Speaker 0: most of it was stuff that you couldn't buy.

538
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:49,360
Speaker 0: it did not exist outside of VHS tapes and SVHS tapes.

539
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,860
Speaker 0: So we had this bonanza and they were free to check out if we were members of the club.

540
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:57,275
Speaker 0: So, you know the front row crew at the time, you know and extended parties.

541
00:35:57,295 --> 00:35:58,539
Speaker 0: Hey, we're like eight or ten of us.

542
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:03,159
Speaker 0: So Every club each one of us would take out three tapes.

543
00:36:03,782 --> 00:36:08,736
Speaker 0: So we'd get 30 VHS tapes and by God if we didn't watch all of them by the next anime.

544
00:36:08,817 --> 00:36:16,882
Speaker 1: at the very least you watch The three you got on your own But usually the ones that were sort of communally watchable were immediately watched Communally.

545
00:36:17,324 --> 00:36:21,040
Speaker 0: now the cool thing was we'd go up there and we didn't know like I didn't know what?

546
00:36:21,441 --> 00:36:23,287
Speaker 0: Anime was what other than we didn't know.

547
00:36:23,407 --> 00:36:31,394
Speaker 0: shit man if I knew now if I knew then when I know now good God I mean, I remember a point when someone said yeah, they're showing episode 5 of cowboy bebop.

548
00:36:31,655 --> 00:36:33,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the one where spike fights vicious.

549
00:36:33,322 --> 00:36:39,537
Speaker 0: and I thought Cowboy bebop a guy named spike fights a guy named vicious.

550
00:36:39,577 --> 00:36:40,360
Speaker 1: That'd be good.

551
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,728
Speaker 1: I was like, that's a real interesting name for a show.

552
00:36:42,748 --> 00:36:44,314
Speaker 0: that can't be good.

553
00:36:44,334 --> 00:36:52,182
Speaker 0: and then I learned yeah But what we would do is I would go up there all of us and they only let a few people into the library at A time.

554
00:36:52,584 --> 00:36:58,113
Speaker 0: so we'd get up there and I'd go over to the tape Nazi or one of the eboard members And they all knew their shit.

555
00:36:58,153 --> 00:37:00,966
Speaker 0: I'd be like, hey What should we watch?

556
00:37:01,067 --> 00:37:03,655
Speaker 0: and they would just pick a tape up and be like watch this.

557
00:37:04,016 --> 00:37:05,139
Speaker 0: and they were always right?

558
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:06,979
Speaker 1: Almost always right.

559
00:37:07,241 --> 00:37:13,937
Speaker 0: Well, they were always right in one way or the other either that it was good and should be watched or it was bad and should be Watched.

560
00:37:15,321 --> 00:37:22,106
Speaker 1: So anyway at one point we picked up a VHS fan sub tape of something called I don't know who picked it or why.

561
00:37:22,127 --> 00:37:30,340
Speaker 0: I think you did did I don't know pretty sure was you but it was called KO beast and it said one through three on it, right?

562
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,550
Speaker 1: So and I think we also got two through seven.

563
00:37:33,611 --> 00:37:34,454
Speaker 0: We got it all.

564
00:37:34,474 --> 00:37:35,700
Speaker 1: we got it all on two tapes.

565
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:44,180
Speaker 0: So long story short The the common thing to do at RIT for us was we'd all get together in one of the lounges probably Peterson.

566
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:49,956
Speaker 0: But later on we moved into saw and we'd all sit around and we take the VCR.

567
00:37:50,016 --> 00:37:55,156
Speaker 1: cuz no we watch this I'm pretty sure on a on the tiny TV with the built-in VCR.

568
00:37:55,397 --> 00:37:59,732
Speaker 0: Oh, right We probably did because the TV lounge anyway, there were.

569
00:38:00,394 --> 00:38:02,280
Speaker 0: we had two VCRs between all of us.

570
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:07,960
Speaker 0: We had my VCR that we can only use if we found it a TV that wasn't being used that we could get the cords to.

571
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:14,137
Speaker 0: Otherwise we had to use the combo TV VCR which barely worked and had a smaller screen.

572
00:38:14,177 --> 00:38:14,960
Speaker 1: It worked just fine.

573
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:15,924
Speaker 1: It was just very small.

574
00:38:15,944 --> 00:38:19,480
Speaker 0: Well, very small means barely worked when there's 10 or 15 people trying to watch.

575
00:38:20,063 --> 00:38:22,112
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was smaller than our monitors.

576
00:38:22,895 --> 00:38:23,880
Speaker 1: That's how small it was.

577
00:38:24,643 --> 00:38:28,420
Speaker 0: So what we would do is we'd hang out late it like on a Saturday morning.

578
00:38:28,581 --> 00:38:30,206
Speaker 0: We all get together eat breakfast at Gracie's.

579
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,336
Speaker 0: then we just like watch anime for like all day and all night.

580
00:38:33,898 --> 00:38:41,971
Speaker 0: Yep, so One night, you know, we were watching anime for like several hours and then it's like, I don't know like midnight and someone's like Hey, let's watch this KO thing.

581
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:43,220
Speaker 0: I bet it's a fighting show.

582
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:49,467
Speaker 1: so we watched KO beast and I Remember that a we all liked it.

583
00:38:49,488 --> 00:38:50,692
Speaker 1: I remember that.

584
00:38:50,772 --> 00:38:53,160
Speaker 1: be the openers and close it.

585
00:38:53,200 --> 00:39:00,940
Speaker 1: Well, the openers are really awesome and memorable the one Daba Daba opener for the first set of shows And the rock and roll bomber opener for the second set.

586
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:02,426
Speaker 0: I was real tired like we were.

587
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:06,282
Speaker 0: it was late and we put this thing in and I was fading fast and thinking to go Into bed.

588
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:10,500
Speaker 0: the opener alone caused me to stay and watch this entire show.

589
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:19,762
Speaker 1: I remember that it was about three animals a tiger guy a bird guy and a mer girl and I remember that Dr.

590
00:39:19,802 --> 00:39:23,251
Speaker 1: Password and that's really all I remembered of this show.

591
00:39:23,271 --> 00:39:28,400
Speaker 0: I remember that it was about giant robots as well Forgot I forgot that it was about.

592
00:39:30,024 --> 00:39:34,799
Speaker 0: I remember the earth was cut in half and I knew Intuitively because I figured it out later.

593
00:39:35,502 --> 00:39:41,466
Speaker 0: But right around that time I'd started to identify, you know in my anime fandom voice actors I liked.

594
00:39:41,527 --> 00:39:51,180
Speaker 0: I didn't know their names I didn't know who they were But I always be pretty sure like that's the same guy who plays this guy that I liked in that other show And I could pick out like three voice actors.

595
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,918
Speaker 0: I didn't know who they were and I knew that Bud Minh was one of those voice actors.

596
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:58,836
Speaker 0: I liked Yep, and that he talked in English all the time.

597
00:39:58,856 --> 00:40:00,023
Speaker 0: It was terrible I say.

598
00:40:00,044 --> 00:40:01,920
Speaker 1: I forgot that until I watch it again.

599
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:11,897
Speaker 0: And I remembered one other thing and I remembered this like so clearly that when I watched this show again recently like I knew this whole scene from beginning to end.

600
00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:18,319
Speaker 0: but There's a scene where the computer has a custom-made trap for each one of them.

601
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:23,660
Speaker 0: And I remember Bud Minh's trap so clearly because it's one of the funniest things I've ever seen.

602
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:29,698
Speaker 0: I don't know why it cracks me up so much, but it just does I forget what the trap was And I just watched the show again.

603
00:40:30,642 --> 00:40:32,614
Speaker 0: It's when he's like on the trapeze like he doesn't want.

604
00:40:32,634 --> 00:40:34,165
Speaker 0: like he's like they won't get me They won't get me.

605
00:40:34,427 --> 00:40:38,732
Speaker 0: and then just like a bird swing appears He's like joy, and he jumps out there.

606
00:40:38,772 --> 00:40:46,680
Speaker 0: He's swinging back and forth singing to himself like Alright, I remember now, and then that giant mace just fucking wrecks him out of nowhere.

607
00:40:47,764 --> 00:40:49,453
Speaker 1: It's good stuff now.

608
00:40:49,514 --> 00:40:53,740
Speaker 1: so Yeah, so we got the show on DVD somewhat recently.

609
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,425
Speaker 1: It's a legal US DVD.

610
00:40:55,465 --> 00:40:58,053
Speaker 1: you can buy it right and we both.

611
00:40:58,294 --> 00:41:00,160
Speaker 1: I ripped it and watched it on my iPhone rim.

612
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:00,521
Speaker 1: I think.

613
00:41:00,561 --> 00:41:01,405
Speaker 1: watch the DVD.

614
00:41:01,665 --> 00:41:08,969
Speaker 0: one thing the show didn't actually get released in the US until like 2003 Really, yeah, it wasn't on VHS or anything.

615
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:10,313
Speaker 0: It doesn't look like it.

616
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:10,474
Speaker 0: Well.

617
00:41:10,514 --> 00:41:11,156
Speaker 1: That's interesting.

618
00:41:11,558 --> 00:41:12,260
Speaker 1: It's just one team.

619
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:12,983
Speaker 1: It's two TV.

620
00:41:13,044 --> 00:41:15,334
Speaker 1: No three three DVDs, right?

621
00:41:15,354 --> 00:41:17,387
Speaker 1: I Don't know how many DVDs.

622
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:26,377
Speaker 0: You know what it is seven 30 or so minute OAV Episodes that were made over a course of multiple years.

623
00:41:26,718 --> 00:41:29,627
Speaker 1: yep And you know the first set has the.

624
00:41:29,848 --> 00:41:30,771
Speaker 1: you know that's.

625
00:41:30,891 --> 00:41:38,383
Speaker 1: one thing about the DVD is that since I had watched old fan subs I knew that the show had multiple openers on The DVD.

626
00:41:39,026 --> 00:41:41,740
Speaker 1: the only opener is the rock and roll bomber open, which is crap.

627
00:41:41,861 --> 00:41:44,300
Speaker 0: I remember we were gonna show it to people because we got these DVDs.

628
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:49,300
Speaker 0: So I put it in and the second opener plays, and I thought I had the wrong DVD or something was messed up.

629
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,725
Speaker 0: So I'm like trying to figure it all out.

630
00:41:51,107 --> 00:41:51,327
Speaker 0: No.

631
00:41:51,488 --> 00:41:54,158
Speaker 0: They just for whatever reason they took out the funny.

632
00:41:54,198 --> 00:41:57,742
Speaker 0: You know The

633
00:41:57,883 --> 00:42:10,334
Speaker 1: first opener is on the DVD in the extras section But they don't actually use it on the episodes and it'll confuse you because you'll start watching the show and at the end of the Opener it'll say KO beast three and you're like what do you mean three?

634
00:42:10,415 --> 00:42:11,097
Speaker 1: Where's one?

635
00:42:11,178 --> 00:42:11,619
Speaker 1: Where's two?

636
00:42:12,402 --> 00:42:16,634
Speaker 1: Because he's just they're using the third opener for every single episode which is annoying.

637
00:42:16,975 --> 00:42:21,852
Speaker 0: now while that opener is pretty good I mean, I really like a rock and roll bomber.

638
00:42:21,892 --> 00:42:24,080
Speaker 1: I mean rock and roll bomber is awesome.

639
00:42:24,461 --> 00:42:26,808
Speaker 0: Oh, you know me side ooh three two ones.

640
00:42:26,908 --> 00:42:27,470
Speaker 0: Let's go that.

641
00:42:28,473 --> 00:42:29,837
Speaker 1: ah is it three two ones.

642
00:42:29,857 --> 00:42:33,492
Speaker 0: Yeah zero Rockin roll bomber hey.

643
00:42:33,512 --> 00:42:34,980
Speaker 1: Oh, I think it is this hello.

644
00:42:35,883 --> 00:42:37,889
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter that song is awesome.

645
00:42:37,969 --> 00:42:39,755
Speaker 1: It is awesome, but the ones have it.

646
00:42:39,775 --> 00:42:41,460
Speaker 1: have it have a song is also awesome.

647
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:50,005
Speaker 0: Yes, and the thing the one thing I guess I didn't realize when I watched the show the first time was that it's really Primarily like.

648
00:42:50,226 --> 00:42:52,234
Speaker 0: I remembered it as being like 80% comedy 20% robot.

649
00:42:54,462 --> 00:42:59,000
Speaker 0: It is like 50% comedy 50% robot like straight-up robot show.

650
00:42:59,100 --> 00:42:59,543
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like.

651
00:42:59,584 --> 00:42:59,805
Speaker 1: I didn't.

652
00:42:59,825 --> 00:43:05,357
Speaker 1: I don't know why I didn't realize it or remember it But this show is actually a lot of robot goings-on.

653
00:43:05,397 --> 00:43:13,320
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not Super robot and it's weird because while there's lots of robot going on like they're sort of there.

654
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:14,850
Speaker 1: But it's not like.

655
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:16,360
Speaker 1: the show is about the robots.

656
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:21,620
Speaker 1: It's like somehow they managed to concentrate fully on the characters despite robot fighting.

657
00:43:21,821 --> 00:43:35,688
Speaker 0: But at the same time is that there's definitely a little bit of poking fun Homage at robot shows because all the cliches are there in kind of messed up ways and like they'll all conform in the big They'll form into the big robot right.

658
00:43:35,749 --> 00:43:38,720
Speaker 1: and usually when you form into the big robot, let's say Voltron, right?

659
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:39,282
Speaker 1: What happens?

660
00:43:39,623 --> 00:43:43,880
Speaker 1: everyone is in the central control room instead of in their individual cockpits, right?

661
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:54,832
Speaker 1: When they form into the big robot in chaos entry beast the three characters get stuck in these tiny little balls and like this little Like triforce and they can't really move and they're crammed in there and

662
00:43:54,853 --> 00:43:56,117
Speaker 0: like controlling the robots

663
00:43:56,137 --> 00:43:57,040
Speaker 1: like another dimension

664
00:43:57,822 --> 00:44:00,080
Speaker 0: Yell at the robots and the robots kind of listen to them.

665
00:44:00,361 --> 00:44:04,500
Speaker 1: Well, the robots sort of are smart and do their own thing even when they're not in them.

666
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:09,958
Speaker 1: So, you know the robots is sort of like their own characters that just don't talk which is kind of cool.

667
00:44:10,379 --> 00:44:14,268
Speaker 0: I guess Yeah the show There's a lot of little like.

668
00:44:14,913 --> 00:44:22,784
Speaker 0: it's a goonie show It's you know, like there's wacky comedies nowadays like the wacky comedy anime that Dave Riley always makes fun of like, oh, hey Someone got punched.

669
00:44:22,824 --> 00:44:23,768
Speaker 0: It's a wacky anime.

670
00:44:23,889 --> 00:44:26,180
Speaker 1: excel saga is like a wacky anime.

671
00:44:26,481 --> 00:44:29,434
Speaker 0: This is wacky before that kind of wacky.

672
00:44:29,454 --> 00:44:30,820
Speaker 0: it's the old kind of wacky.

673
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,225
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's definitely what it is.

674
00:44:32,245 --> 00:44:35,315
Speaker 1: And I really got the slower pace to it.

675
00:44:35,736 --> 00:44:37,503
Speaker 1: It's less extreme It's just got.

676
00:44:37,543 --> 00:44:41,500
Speaker 1: it's got fewer fewer jokes a little bit more subtle jokes.

677
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:49,807
Speaker 0: a lot of the jokes are like throwaway references to other shows or like throwaway references to pop culture or just Throw away references to fucking.

678
00:44:49,847 --> 00:44:50,529
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

679
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:50,931
Speaker 1: or they'll be.

680
00:44:50,971 --> 00:45:01,307
Speaker 1: they'll be wacky things that are sort of subdued Like just the fact that the bird people use lots of English words, you know, it's not really like extreme comedy It's just sort of subdued.

681
00:45:01,348 --> 00:45:03,180
Speaker 1: They're speaking English words randomly.

682
00:45:05,623 --> 00:45:07,439
Speaker 0: Hey, baby, I'm the bomb.

683
00:45:08,022 --> 00:45:10,752
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's kind of funny when they say something in English.

684
00:45:10,772 --> 00:45:13,504
Speaker 0: Oh my god, Bud's not his dad I don't know.

685
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:14,859
Speaker 1: Is it his dad or his grandpa?

686
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:19,700
Speaker 0: It's the elder of the bird village who kind of looks like a cross between Uncle Sam and Colonel Sanders.

687
00:45:19,761 --> 00:45:20,144
Speaker 0: I don't know.

688
00:45:20,165 --> 00:45:25,660
Speaker 1: I think it looks more like Santa Claus, but short with a hunch, but the fact less fat.

689
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:30,013
Speaker 0: But they there's this scene and the dove one the dubs terrible.

690
00:45:30,033 --> 00:45:31,658
Speaker 0: I'm not don't dubs terrible.

691
00:45:31,678 --> 00:45:49,284
Speaker 0: But anyway He they asked him a question and you know a plot question and he thinks for a minute and got mumbles to himself and I'm going to quote exactly a B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Oh.

692
00:45:49,425 --> 00:46:00,040
Speaker 0: and then he answers the question like what You just started saying the alphabet in English and then answers the question or like at one point the show.

693
00:46:00,381 --> 00:46:01,865
Speaker 0: You know, it's a robot show comedy show.

694
00:46:01,986 --> 00:46:05,798
Speaker 0: one episode opens and they're like playing mahjong and it's totally.

695
00:46:05,818 --> 00:46:06,500
Speaker 1: that's the episode.

696
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:07,126
Speaker 1: We're in the cave.

697
00:46:07,187 --> 00:46:08,419
Speaker 1: They can't get out and they have no food.

698
00:46:08,681 --> 00:46:11,900
Speaker 1: So it starts and they're playing mahjong and whoever loses gets eaten.

699
00:46:12,081 --> 00:46:15,000
Speaker 0: That is one of the funniest scenes in the show when they just try to eat.

700
00:46:15,341 --> 00:46:17,472
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna say who but it's just cuz.

701
00:46:17,512 --> 00:46:21,559
Speaker 0: Maymar is like clinging on to him Just like she bit him and just wouldn't let go and he's running away.

702
00:46:22,122 --> 00:46:23,125
Speaker 1: You know who I forgot about?

703
00:46:23,166 --> 00:46:26,377
Speaker 1: that's probably the best character in the show huddle Maymar's mom.

704
00:46:26,518 --> 00:46:30,628
Speaker 0: Oh my god She's one of those Characters.

705
00:46:30,953 --> 00:46:33,151
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah That's my kind.

706
00:46:33,212 --> 00:46:33,940
Speaker 0: That's another thing.

707
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:34,422
Speaker 0: It's kind of.

708
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:38,500
Speaker 0: it's only used in parody and it's kind of underused now.

709
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:42,058
Speaker 0: but that was like that was one of those anime tropes of all.

710
00:46:42,098 --> 00:46:48,040
Speaker 0: just like The evil girls always have complicated hair or complicated hair girls are always evil cliche.

711
00:46:48,662 --> 00:46:50,929
Speaker 0: You don't see that so much now because they all have complicated hair.

712
00:46:51,431 --> 00:46:51,993
Speaker 1: That's right.

713
00:46:52,013 --> 00:46:52,515
Speaker 1: That's right.

714
00:46:52,535 --> 00:46:54,060
Speaker 0: That used to be a big cliche.

715
00:46:54,703 --> 00:46:55,347
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz we know.

716
00:46:55,387 --> 00:46:57,660
Speaker 1: nor than like the good girls in the shows, right?

717
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:02,119
Speaker 1: I would always have like this real simple hair like just straight or just short, you know, that's it.

718
00:47:02,461 --> 00:47:08,560
Speaker 1: But like some girl would have like some like crazy hair that was just all over the place and that obviously meant that she was.

719
00:47:08,741 --> 00:47:13,280
Speaker 1: Because no, you know good character would set up crazy hairstyles that are all over the place.

720
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:19,077
Speaker 0: But chaos entry beast is kind of a. it is an old show is made in like the early 90s.

721
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,266
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's an early 90s show.

722
00:47:21,286 --> 00:47:22,572
Speaker 1: It's it's actually.

723
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:24,339
Speaker 1: it's pretty good animation because it was an OAV.

724
00:47:24,661 --> 00:47:31,040
Speaker 1: So it actually looks like a sort of a later 90s show but with a less digital color technology.

725
00:47:31,861 --> 00:47:36,558
Speaker 0: But you know the animations pretty good animation kind like it holds up like if you look at you don't see.

726
00:47:36,658 --> 00:47:37,180
Speaker 1: it's not like.

727
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,180
Speaker 1: You know, there aren't like lots of animation errors or anything like that.

728
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:41,203
Speaker 1: It's like it was an OAV.

729
00:47:41,244 --> 00:47:46,080
Speaker 1: they tried hard on this shit and apparently it was popular enough to make three sets of it.

730
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:50,660
Speaker 1: You know normally, you know, if it was if it wasn't popular, they would have stopped after the first set.

731
00:47:50,821 --> 00:47:52,259
Speaker 1: So that's that's pretty good right there.

732
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:57,718
Speaker 0: Well from what I read now apparently it was originally like they made the original OAV in like.

733
00:47:57,758 --> 00:47:59,252
Speaker 0: oh here we go 92 and it went.

734
00:47:59,293 --> 00:47:59,880
Speaker 0: you know went over.

735
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:16,457
Speaker 0: Okay as far as I can tell they didn't make the second OAV which you know on all the rest of the show until late 93 and Apparently the second project was pushed heavily by Ito and something project before which was like his studio at the time.

736
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:20,882
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Like they really pushed to have this thing get finished Uh-huh.

737
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:25,633
Speaker 0: I don't know how it sold though because those numbers are not accessible to me.

738
00:48:25,814 --> 00:48:26,937
Speaker 1: No, not really.

739
00:48:27,578 --> 00:48:37,605
Speaker 1: Oh We're forgetting the most important part, but we should just Akumaka All right, so that is the other thing that I remembered from this show that It was like.

740
00:48:37,705 --> 00:48:57,858
Speaker 1: I guess she was the most memorable thing until just now and I forgot it Right is a character called Akumako and like I remembered Aku Oh, there were times where I could remember Akumako, but couldn't remember what show she was from and basically she's his little devil character That floats around near the bad guys and whenever someone's gonna die.

741
00:48:57,878 --> 00:49:00,087
Speaker 1: She's like yes Yes die so I can eat your soul.

742
00:49:00,107 --> 00:49:03,000
Speaker 1: and she was just like a fork and a knife and she wants to eat souls.

743
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:06,440
Speaker 1: And I watched the show again and she was still there.

744
00:49:06,521 --> 00:49:10,273
Speaker 1: She was still funny but it's like she almost doesn't even exist.

745
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:15,920
Speaker 1: the other characters like Hardly ever even recognized her existence except for maybe two or three times.

746
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,219
Speaker 0: well V darn does because he like he's kind of.

747
00:49:21,121 --> 00:49:25,802
Speaker 1: He says something to her like a few times But that's.

748
00:49:25,863 --> 00:49:33,320
Speaker 0: and then once V shown like smacks her Those are in the lava and kills her cuz she's so annoying and scary.

749
00:49:33,481 --> 00:49:35,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, but most of the time like she's just like yes.

750
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:38,180
Speaker 1: Yes, give me your soul and no one says anything.

751
00:49:38,261 --> 00:49:39,339
Speaker 1: It's like she's not even there.

752
00:49:39,561 --> 00:49:42,952
Speaker 1: You could edit the part you could edit her out and you wouldn't even notice.

753
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:50,396
Speaker 0: but a lot of things in the show kind of Come out of nowhere like the fact that and the thing is you never learn about Akumaka.

754
00:49:50,436 --> 00:49:51,499
Speaker 1: Like why is she there?

755
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:53,123
Speaker 1: Why are there?

756
00:49:53,384 --> 00:49:56,554
Speaker 1: why they're devils that eat souls, why is he a mage night?

757
00:49:56,794 --> 00:49:58,198
Speaker 0: What is a mage night from?

758
00:49:58,259 --> 00:49:58,620
Speaker 1: it's a dude.

759
00:49:59,123 --> 00:50:01,278
Speaker 1: It's a dude with electric armor, obviously why?

760
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:06,551
Speaker 0: Actually, there's a V darn manga that was separate really.

761
00:50:06,772 --> 00:50:07,032
Speaker 0: Yes.

762
00:50:07,052 --> 00:50:08,858
Speaker 0: I don't think it was ever translated.

763
00:50:08,878 --> 00:50:10,523
Speaker 0: Wow I kind of wanted.

764
00:50:10,905 --> 00:50:15,884
Speaker 1: one thing I thought was interesting though was how you know V darn is sort of like the henchman of the Real bad guys, right?

765
00:50:16,345 --> 00:50:21,080
Speaker 1: But eventually the real bad guys don't need him anymore, but he keeps going on his own.

766
00:50:22,081 --> 00:50:29,169
Speaker 1: Yeah, I sort of you don't see that happen too often whether just like the big bad guys just be like screw you henchman We don't need you anymore.

767
00:50:29,249 --> 00:50:29,855
Speaker 1: Go you're not work.

768
00:50:29,896 --> 00:50:30,340
Speaker 0: Go away.

769
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,590
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is the original like the feel V darn and vision.

770
00:50:33,631 --> 00:50:34,533
Speaker 0: they kind of start out.

771
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,580
Speaker 0: They're basically Team Rocket.

772
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:37,802
Speaker 1: Basically, yeah.

773
00:50:38,444 --> 00:50:39,909
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the show is a lot.

774
00:50:39,929 --> 00:50:41,354
Speaker 1: that V shown is pretty smart.

775
00:50:41,394 --> 00:50:42,177
Speaker 1: rise in Team Rocket.

776
00:50:42,197 --> 00:50:42,899
Speaker 1: They're both idiots.

777
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:46,330
Speaker 0: Well, I don't me out there's pretty smart.

778
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:52,711
Speaker 1: so I guess me out is Akumaka I guess But Akumaka was a lot stupider than me out.

779
00:50:53,052 --> 00:50:59,059
Speaker 0: So the plot if you wonder is basically that the earth was split in two.

780
00:51:00,061 --> 00:51:06,789
Speaker 1: Literally just two hemispheres went boop and no one knows why but it's in the opener But it's ancient history.

781
00:51:07,251 --> 00:51:20,795
Speaker 0: the three main characters Juan Daba Daba Daba his last name Bud mint by the way is voice-acted by nother not other than pumpkin head koyasu my man.

782
00:51:22,742 --> 00:51:26,654
Speaker 1: The thing is he doesn't sound like his usual self because he's not.

783
00:51:26,715 --> 00:51:28,280
Speaker 1: it's not a be shown in type character.

784
00:51:28,421 --> 00:51:29,006
Speaker 1: Yes, he is.

785
00:51:29,067 --> 00:51:30,460
Speaker 0: He's totally be shown in type character.

786
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:32,968
Speaker 0: Well, he tries to be tries to be.

787
00:51:33,229 --> 00:51:36,038
Speaker 0: he gets all the ladies until he turns into a chicken pretty much.

788
00:51:36,078 --> 00:51:38,696
Speaker 0: Yeah Who is the mayor?

789
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:40,626
Speaker 1: She's a mermaid.

790
00:51:41,128 --> 00:51:42,774
Speaker 0: Yes, and she's she's kind of awesome.

791
00:51:42,794 --> 00:51:43,517
Speaker 1: She's kind of cute too.

792
00:51:43,597 --> 00:51:44,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, she's awesome.

793
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:44,922
Speaker 1: I like her.

794
00:51:44,962 --> 00:51:50,860
Speaker 0: don't forget Tuttle the sea turtle who is basically the only smart one who always just kind of hangs back.

795
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:54,271
Speaker 1: It's basically the smart trusty quiet reliable guy.

796
00:51:54,291 --> 00:51:56,037
Speaker 0: and don't forget doc at all.

797
00:51:56,137 --> 00:51:57,080
Speaker 0: pass a while.

798
00:51:58,787 --> 00:52:02,390
Speaker 0: You need charm Passo his daughter.

799
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,940
Speaker 1: She's the magical girl who's like the plot device.

800
00:52:05,543 --> 00:52:07,493
Speaker 1: She basically effectively a living McGuffin.

801
00:52:07,795 --> 00:52:07,996
Speaker 1: her.

802
00:52:08,278 --> 00:52:13,033
Speaker 0: her Plot consists of screaming Juan's name and then making magic shit happen.

803
00:52:13,415 --> 00:52:15,060
Speaker 1: Yeah accidentally, you know.

804
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:20,900
Speaker 1: It's just like every other anime where there's a girl with a magical pendant who's you know, activates all the magic stuff.

805
00:52:21,001 --> 00:52:21,384
Speaker 1: That's her.

806
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:30,200
Speaker 0: and I just want to point out you'll see it when you watch this show, but The big evil bad guys in the end are basically whack-a-moles.

807
00:52:32,712 --> 00:52:33,963
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, they kinda are.

808
00:52:34,465 --> 00:52:43,852
Speaker 0: I'm gonna say this if you want to see some people might balk and calling this old-school anime But it is of the school that is older than the current school.

809
00:52:44,233 --> 00:52:48,590
Speaker 0: There is a school older than the old school if You look at current anime.

810
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:49,436
Speaker 0: This is old school.

811
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:56,562
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean, it's like it's weird because it's like there's old school older school and oldest school like the different School.

812
00:52:56,843 --> 00:53:02,039
Speaker 0: it's like the difference between watching Tobor the eighth man versus watching eight man after.

813
00:53:03,241 --> 00:53:10,360
Speaker 1: It's like 80s astro boy versus 60s astro boy, you know, but I highly recommend KO century beast one.

814
00:53:11,042 --> 00:53:11,865
Speaker 0: It's super cheap.

815
00:53:11,885 --> 00:53:13,611
Speaker 0: You can get the whole thing for like nothing.

816
00:53:13,631 --> 00:53:14,976
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is not.

817
00:53:15,337 --> 00:53:18,607
Speaker 1: if you can find it No one's gonna charge you a lot of money for it to.

818
00:53:19,048 --> 00:53:24,705
Speaker 0: this show is kind of classic and I think it's kind of Underwatched and underrated.

819
00:53:24,745 --> 00:53:26,592
Speaker 1: and under no, I think it's just under no.

820
00:53:26,612 --> 00:53:28,840
Speaker 1: and the thing is it comes off as a little bit furry.

821
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:32,935
Speaker 1: But you know because it's basically about you know beasts versus humans.

822
00:53:32,975 --> 00:53:36,306
Speaker 1: That wasn't a concern for me Yeah, but the fur in is really there's.

823
00:53:36,326 --> 00:53:38,012
Speaker 1: no there's no scary.

824
00:53:38,052 --> 00:53:40,178
Speaker 1: fur in is just like they happen to be animal people.

825
00:53:40,359 --> 00:53:41,303
Speaker 0: whatever I don't know.

826
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:42,950
Speaker 0: I didn't I didn't think to myself.

827
00:53:43,231 --> 00:53:44,054
Speaker 0: Well, is this furry?

828
00:53:44,195 --> 00:53:45,400
Speaker 0: Well, is it scary furry?

829
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:50,336
Speaker 1: Remember when what's-his-name did the awesome chaos entry beast cosplay?

830
00:53:50,476 --> 00:53:52,626
Speaker 0: Oh my god We'll have to talk about that someday.

831
00:53:53,028 --> 00:53:53,913
Speaker 1: pictures of it around.

832
00:53:54,033 --> 00:53:54,515
Speaker 0: I'll find him.

833
00:53:54,536 --> 00:53:55,480
Speaker 0: I'll make that a thing of the day.

834
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,042
Speaker 0: That was one of the.

835
00:53:56,725 --> 00:53:58,613
Speaker 0: that was quite a cosplay.

836
00:53:58,994 --> 00:54:00,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like that.

837
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:04,800
Speaker 1: It was great how they like showed up at the last second and then they got voted into winning.

838
00:54:05,321 --> 00:54:07,106
Speaker 0: No, we vote they got second place.

839
00:54:07,186 --> 00:54:07,768
Speaker 1: Oh, did they?

840
00:54:07,808 --> 00:54:11,096
Speaker 0: because the crowd actually, you know who won that cosplay?

841
00:54:11,577 --> 00:54:13,202
Speaker 0: No, Emily Really?

842
00:54:13,282 --> 00:54:15,388
Speaker 0: That was Emily who won with her.

843
00:54:15,649 --> 00:54:16,291
Speaker 0: Well, I'll talk.

844
00:54:16,652 --> 00:54:17,474
Speaker 0: I'll save that for what.

845
00:54:17,555 --> 00:54:19,340
Speaker 1: that was the Princess Mononoke costume.

846
00:54:19,661 --> 00:54:23,735
Speaker 0: That was a good guy before Emily and I were dating and I as far as I was.

847
00:54:23,776 --> 00:54:27,373
Speaker 1: he even had like little boots on That costume as far as I was concerned.

848
00:54:27,414 --> 00:54:33,560
Speaker 0: She was just this really Incredibly cute girl who showed up to the anime club and it had a little cape and it had a little masky thing.

849
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:45,094
Speaker 0: Yeah, so basically the club voted to give her first place and then this like professional cosplay got second place partly because it While it was awesome, it lacked heart and it showed up late.

850
00:54:45,436 --> 00:54:52,127
Speaker 0: Yeah Oh Man those were good days, but KO century beasts.

851
00:54:52,148 --> 00:55:00,140
Speaker 0: Well, if you haven't seen a lot of older anime It'll really kind of put you into that old-school watching anime move.

852
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:08,432
Speaker 1: Yeah, really, you know, it's not like the greatest show in the universe, but it makes you feel like it's 1999 When you watch this shit, yeah, like this show.

853
00:55:08,533 --> 00:55:10,260
Speaker 0: really this was my fandom back then.

854
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:13,052
Speaker 0: I mean if you like this, you should probably watch like it's a.

855
00:55:13,092 --> 00:55:14,880
Speaker 1: it's got a lot of nostalgia powers.

856
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:25,472
Speaker 1: So if you don't feel that nostalgia it might weaken the show for you the way around that Watch it late at night with a group of people definitely Definitely in that genre of watching it alone.

857
00:55:25,513 --> 00:55:34,928
Speaker 1: You might be like, okay, it's an anime big deal But if you watch it like anime club with a whole bunch of anime fans or at a convention with a bunch of sugared up Kids, it'll be pretty awesome.

858
00:55:35,389 --> 00:55:44,980
Speaker 0: If we get the the secret Otakon plan I can't reveal what that is yet But if the secret Otakon plan comes to pass this show is so being shown at midnight.

859
00:55:45,322 --> 00:55:46,350
Speaker 1: No, I don't know.

860
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:47,860
Speaker 1: there are better things to show at midnight.

861
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:50,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe at 11 before the midnight showing.

862
00:55:50,989 --> 00:55:52,854
Speaker 1: well say we got a. what's a plan?

863
00:55:52,874 --> 00:56:01,643
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I got ideas for the show, but If you like this show watch like I don't know the old birdie the mighty or like I don't know.

864
00:56:01,663 --> 00:56:08,620
Speaker 0: I'm trying to think of a good segue and maybe the new birdie the mighty watch birdie the mighty Show is like chaos century beast.

865
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:10,762
Speaker 0: There aren't many Those.

866
00:56:10,983 --> 00:56:14,312
Speaker 0: if you like robot shows watch this because it will.

867
00:56:14,673 --> 00:56:17,140
Speaker 0: they will point out other robot shows in a big way.

868
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,568
Speaker 1: Koto-cha is a little similar a little bit.

869
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:21,154
Speaker 0: Yeah, it has that similar like.

870
00:56:21,174 --> 00:56:25,528
Speaker 1: it's around the same Time-frame and it's also a comedy.

871
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:28,637
Speaker 1: doesn't have robots though, but you know a little bit.

872
00:56:28,978 --> 00:56:32,915
Speaker 0: Yeah You know, this show is just worth watching if you're an anime fan.

873
00:56:32,935 --> 00:56:34,100
Speaker 0: I feel like you should have seen it.

874
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:34,581
Speaker 1: Yeah, I do.

875
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:52,740
Speaker 1: I do think it's unique though in that most robot shows tend to either be you know the sort of like, you know, super serious like a Gundam or a gassaraki kind of thing or There's sort of like messenger sort of you know kids wackiness go guy gar.

876
00:56:53,162 --> 00:56:54,709
Speaker 1: This is sort of like a weird.

877
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:57,020
Speaker 1: Where do you see like the comedy robot show?

878
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:03,640
Speaker 1: It's not something you see too often At least I can't really think of any and it definitely it does play it straight about this time.

879
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:09,000
Speaker 0: But kind of you know slayers will always kind of be like it's dumb and certain awesome and hilarious.

880
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:14,696
Speaker 1: There'll be one episode about a fish man But eventually it gets around to a serious fantasy plan.

881
00:57:14,796 --> 00:57:16,663
Speaker 0: even during the series It'll always keep.

882
00:57:16,884 --> 00:57:18,689
Speaker 0: it'll periodically jump back to the comedy.

883
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:22,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, they'll be like it's like in a funny episode a fish man episode.

884
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:28,260
Speaker 1: They'll be jokes the whole time, but in a serious episode They'll just be like, you know, five to ten jokes at random spots.

885
00:57:28,341 --> 00:57:35,892
Speaker 0: But they'll be short jokes You know and slayers will always have a place in my heart for the fact that it was the first show I saw where someone took a sweat drop and tried to kill someone with it.

886
00:57:35,912 --> 00:57:36,897
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was a good one.

887
00:57:36,917 --> 00:57:40,647
Speaker 0: and Anyway, this isn't the Slayer show.

888
00:57:40,667 --> 00:57:43,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, those slayers has a similar fandom era for me.

889
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:52,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, slayers like fantasy plus comedy and it's sort of like the same level of comedy as ko beast almost except Maybe it has more quantity of comedy.

890
00:57:52,341 --> 00:57:58,789
Speaker 0: But this show does have a plot and the plot actually despite being a primarily a comedy Isn't that bad?

891
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:00,600
Speaker 0: like it plays itself pretty well.

892
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:04,280
Speaker 1: It's an average anime plot, you know bad guys are up to no good.

893
00:58:04,561 --> 00:58:07,290
Speaker 1: There's a little bit of mystery of what Gaia is.

894
00:58:07,711 --> 00:58:10,200
Speaker 1: the characters don't really know what they're doing, but they're doing it.

895
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:17,320
Speaker 1: Anyway, they're all kind of idiot jerks and in each episode like weird stuff happens like that to repair the robots.

896
00:58:17,641 --> 00:58:22,498
Speaker 1: But the guy who was gonna repair the robots is actually like two pigs who were standing on top of each other.

897
00:58:22,518 --> 00:58:23,582
Speaker 0: Oh my god I loved him.

898
00:58:24,044 --> 00:58:32,231
Speaker 0: that episode in particular that whole episode was so slayers because they're like in the town Eating all the food in the inn and then everything gets destroyed.

899
00:58:32,311 --> 00:58:35,260
Speaker 1: So is the episode where the bird down all the bird town.

900
00:58:35,581 --> 00:58:43,422
Speaker 0: Yeah, if the show like it jumps genres a whole bunch, but it always comes back to robot show Mm-hmm.

901
00:58:44,305 --> 00:58:45,408
Speaker 0: I don't know what else we can say.

902
00:58:45,528 --> 00:58:49,600
Speaker 1: I'd recommend it's not allowed to say about seven episodes without spoiling the whole thing.

903
00:58:49,761 --> 00:58:51,649
Speaker 0: I just I'd really recommend checking it out.

904
00:58:51,709 --> 00:58:53,497
Speaker 0: It's kind of short, you know seven episodes.

905
00:58:53,577 --> 00:58:54,280
Speaker 0: It's super cheap.

906
00:58:54,581 --> 00:58:55,665
Speaker 1: Seven episodes is it right?

907
00:58:55,765 --> 00:58:56,989
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can totally get it.

908
00:58:57,290 --> 00:58:59,237
Speaker 0: I bought the whole box set for like ten bucks.

909
00:58:59,558 --> 00:59:02,672
Speaker 0: Damn And I don't know I really liked it.

910
00:59:03,316 --> 00:59:05,859
Speaker 1: Yeah, I You know, I remembered it.

911
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,037
Speaker 1: I think my memories of it were more fond than the reality of watching it again, but I wasn't like.

912
00:59:11,198 --> 00:59:11,880
Speaker 1: oh, this is terrible.

913
00:59:11,961 --> 00:59:14,260
Speaker 1: It was better than a lot of the anime that I does new today.

914
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:20,380
Speaker 0: I definitely felt the desire after I finished every episode to watch the next one which that's kind of rare now.

915
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:25,524
Speaker 1: I didn't have a strong desire, but I did watch the whole thing without you know Stopping plus.
