00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,548
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday April 16th.

2
00:00:11,869 --> 00:00:15,840
Speaker 0: I'm rim Scott's downstairs making dinner, and this is geek night.

3
00:00:16,462 --> 00:00:20,797
Speaker 0: Tonight we talked about some comic books that I kind of liked.

4
00:00:20,997 --> 00:00:26,918
Speaker 1: surprisingly Let's do this.

5
00:00:30,912 --> 00:00:34,722
Speaker 0: So what I'm about to say is not often what you would expect.

6
00:00:35,023 --> 00:00:37,209
Speaker 0: a geeky podcast like this to start with.

7
00:00:37,249 --> 00:00:41,710
Speaker 0: it's one of those Sentences that sets off a whole bunch of alarm bells.

8
00:00:42,171 --> 00:00:46,464
Speaker 0: Usually the alarm bells along the lines of the person I'm listening to is a wacko.

9
00:00:46,484 --> 00:00:48,530
Speaker 0: I should probably stop listening.

10
00:00:48,611 --> 00:00:50,569
Speaker 0: Are you gonna say what is the number for the police?

11
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:55,508
Speaker 1: Are you gonna say something that sounds like like two in the morning middle of nowhere a.m.

12
00:00:55,548 --> 00:00:55,910
Speaker 1: Radio?

13
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,390
Speaker 0: No, but I feel like our duty now is to hook up an a.m.

14
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,320
Speaker 0: Radio two in the morning in the middle of nowhere.

15
00:01:02,621 --> 00:01:04,170
Speaker 0: record something and bring it back.

16
00:01:05,551 --> 00:01:07,618
Speaker 1: CC will come down and us like a ton of bricks.

17
00:01:07,778 --> 00:01:08,742
Speaker 0: They'll have to find us.

18
00:01:08,762 --> 00:01:11,110
Speaker 1: I guess they're pretty good at that.

19
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,936
Speaker 0: I'm gonna say another kind of thing.

20
00:01:13,177 --> 00:01:17,353
Speaker 0: so today the the Jews tried to kill me Did they?

21
00:01:17,454 --> 00:01:18,881
Speaker 0: but luckily I escaped.

22
00:01:19,222 --> 00:01:23,123
Speaker 1: yeah my knife wasn't sharp enough That Jews plural.

23
00:01:23,546 --> 00:01:29,506
Speaker 0: you see Passovers coming up as you might know because the New York anime festival comic-con the New York comic-con.

24
00:01:29,526 --> 00:01:30,369
Speaker 0: I always confuse the two.

25
00:01:30,952 --> 00:01:37,003
Speaker 0: Apologize for the fact that it's happening over Passover, and you know it is despite all our pressness.

26
00:01:37,103 --> 00:01:39,190
Speaker 0: We'll have to go to his family's house on Saturday.

27
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,019
Speaker 1: Well, it's in Queens.

28
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:51,850
Speaker 1: It's not very far, but The thing is it's pretty funny because you know like comics are very Comics in the American the United States and Jewishness are pretty tight.

29
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:56,890
Speaker 1: You know most of the big-time creators of comics in the olden days were Jews.

30
00:01:57,355 --> 00:02:00,278
Speaker 1: Stanley's Jew Will Eisner was a Jew.

31
00:02:00,298 --> 00:02:02,849
Speaker 1: you know Jack Kirby and pretty sure is Jew.

32
00:02:03,372 --> 00:02:06,150
Speaker 0: But there's something that happens mostly in New York City.

33
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:12,630
Speaker 0: You don't see this sort of thing in a lot of other places except this kind of the downstate, New York greater metropolitan area.

34
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,069
Speaker 0: I was almost run over by a mitzvah tank.

35
00:02:15,852 --> 00:02:17,156
Speaker 1: The mitzvah tank is driving around.

36
00:02:17,196 --> 00:02:21,249
Speaker 0: those know that the mitzvah tank went over the line this year.

37
00:02:21,611 --> 00:02:25,364
Speaker 1: Uh-huh cuz usually right that that's a special kind of Jew.

38
00:02:25,585 --> 00:02:33,417
Speaker 0: the the mitzvah tank Jews This is this was all right, so I'm walking on 42nd Street actually on 43rd Street.

39
00:02:33,437 --> 00:02:33,959
Speaker 0: Don't ask why.

40
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,450
Speaker 0: up toward 5th Avenue, and I get to 5th Avenue.

41
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:43,224
Speaker 0: I want to cross 5th Avenue, and I'm waiting but up ahead I hear all this ruckus all this noise, and I hear fire trucks.

42
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:46,700
Speaker 0: I think all right something's going on Mm-hmm which is no big deal.

43
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,110
Speaker 0: you hear that almost every day in the cities.

44
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:49,783
Speaker 0: I just ignore it, and I'm you know waiting.

45
00:02:50,105 --> 00:02:50,710
Speaker 0: what's going on?

46
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,341
Speaker 0: I see the light turn green, but no one's going and there's honking up ahead.

47
00:02:54,361 --> 00:03:06,569
Speaker 0: I finally get there and Despite having a green light in a walk signal and There's a crowd of people not walking because mitzvah tank upon mitzvah tank is running the red light going.

48
00:03:06,589 --> 00:03:11,504
Speaker 0: I Kid you not about 50 miles an hour really a lot of them.

49
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,270
Speaker 0: there were like 70 of these things.

50
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,333
Speaker 1: Yeah They have a lot of them.

51
00:03:14,473 --> 00:03:23,244
Speaker 0: they blocked 5th Avenue in a line one after the other going as fast as they could Refusing to let anyone get on the streets running red lights.

52
00:03:23,465 --> 00:03:24,830
Speaker 0: They almost hit this old lady.

53
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,370
Speaker 0: They almost hit me because eventually a bunch of us like you know what screw you people.

54
00:03:28,972 --> 00:03:34,630
Speaker 0: And we all walk out into the street and one of the mitzvah tanks doesn't slow down and just barely swerves around the crowd.

55
00:03:35,451 --> 00:03:38,850
Speaker 0: And then all the other ones kind of pile up sounded like one of them hit another one way back.

56
00:03:39,171 --> 00:03:42,222
Speaker 0: And then there's all this yelling and they're trying to push through the crowd.

57
00:03:42,503 --> 00:03:48,402
Speaker 0: one a guy got out of the car starts yelling everyone To get out of his way, and then I see where the fire truck noises were coming from.

58
00:03:48,944 --> 00:04:04,709
Speaker 0: there's this red sports car convertible And in it is the most acidic acidic Jew I've ever seen and he's standing up and he's got a loudspeaker and he's yelling at everyone to get out of his way and He's got a large boombox playing the sound of a fire truck.

59
00:04:05,573 --> 00:04:07,525
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, and he's not legal.

60
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:21,829
Speaker 0: No so I'm kind of just watching this whole spectacle and the the people in the Mitzvah tanks as they get bogged down by people who eventually start walking out in front of them Start yelling at people and people are yelling back and one guy like kicked one of the mitzvah tanks.

61
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,967
Speaker 0: Everyone's getting all crazy, and then the police came.

62
00:04:24,987 --> 00:04:32,968
Speaker 0: yep That's what they do and the police didn't know what to do because there were far more Mitzvah tanks than there were cop cars at that time because this had just begun.

63
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,674
Speaker 0: yep So I see the cop.

64
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:41,301
Speaker 0: one of the cops had figured out that there's this red sports car guy who's driving up and down the street Illegally directing this whole thing.

65
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:54,190
Speaker 0: so uh Chase ensued, and I did not get to see the conclusion because I couldn't run fast enough But something happened down by like 38th Street And I can't wait to see what the New York Post has to say about this tomorrow.

66
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,635
Speaker 1: You care what the New York Post says.

67
00:04:55,655 --> 00:04:58,044
Speaker 0: they're the ones that'll sensationalize it the most.

68
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,730
Speaker 0: there'll be some stupid headline.

69
00:04:59,992 --> 00:05:02,409
Speaker 1: I'd rather read the daily news, and that's a piece of shit, too.

70
00:05:03,112 --> 00:05:04,457
Speaker 0: The New York Post is something special.

71
00:05:04,477 --> 00:05:07,830
Speaker 1: It's funny that they sell all these like newspapers at the train state.

72
00:05:08,131 --> 00:05:10,198
Speaker 1: I see all these newspapers, and they think most of them.

73
00:05:10,258 --> 00:05:15,211
Speaker 1: You know they're pretty cheap is like 25 cents, and I go wow That's.

74
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:23,449
Speaker 1: I would use it as toilet paper if it didn't have ink on it, but seriously You don't know what a Mitzvah tank is.

75
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,239
Speaker 1: Basically the deal is right.

76
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,683
Speaker 1: is that there's a?

77
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,124
Speaker 1: you know there's.

78
00:05:29,285 --> 00:05:29,886
Speaker 1: there's different.

79
00:05:30,147 --> 00:05:32,113
Speaker 1: you know unlike you know Christians Right they have.

80
00:05:32,354 --> 00:05:33,558
Speaker 1: there's different all different kinds.

81
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:38,161
Speaker 1: you got Catholics you got Protestants, but then within the Protestants You got different kinds right and you got the.

82
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,530
Speaker 1: you know it's all different kinds.

83
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,175
Speaker 1: They all believe different things right?

84
00:05:41,876 --> 00:05:42,498
Speaker 1: and the Jews?

85
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:52,085
Speaker 1: there's some groups of Jews who believe different things right, but in general You know just sort of speaking generally they they're Jews really.

86
00:05:52,246 --> 00:05:58,042
Speaker 1: they don't believe different things They just believe more strongly or less strongly right.

87
00:05:58,202 --> 00:06:00,990
Speaker 1: It's like a Reform Jew is like yeah, I'm Jewish.

88
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:05,727
Speaker 1: Whatever a conservative Jew is like yeah, I'm Jewish all right all right.

89
00:06:06,048 --> 00:06:08,299
Speaker 1: an Orthodox Jew is like I am so Jewish.

90
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:14,703
Speaker 1: I'm like kosher, and I got two sets of dishes and a Hasidic Jew is like a Mitzvah tank.

91
00:06:14,743 --> 00:06:18,155
Speaker 1: You know well yes now The has not.

92
00:06:18,195 --> 00:06:20,683
Speaker 1: all the Hasidic Jews are Mitzvah tank driving types.

93
00:06:20,723 --> 00:06:22,930
Speaker 1: those are specifically the Lebovitches.

94
00:06:23,593 --> 00:06:26,690
Speaker 1: The Lebovitches are not only Hasidic, but they are crazy.

95
00:06:27,273 --> 00:06:33,897
Speaker 0: You gotta watch out for them, and you know how many people in the street today were like hey, you Jewish I was like nope They were just checking.

96
00:06:34,179 --> 00:06:35,005
Speaker 0: Yep, just checking.

97

Speaker 0: but These Mitzvah tanks like.

98
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:46,790
Speaker 0: the spectacle that I beheld on Fifth Avenue today was epic And I wish I'd had the video camera because they almost ran over so many old ladies.

99
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,041
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, they're crazy Lebovitches.

100
00:06:50,081 --> 00:06:52,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, you gotta watch out for them, so that was my day.

101
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right my day was not so exciting.

102
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,743
Speaker 1: I went to work and did work.

103
00:06:57,104 --> 00:06:57,465
Speaker 0: That's it.

104
00:06:57,485 --> 00:06:58,910
Speaker 0: No no excitement.

Speaker 1: Yeah, well you know are you guys talking about the comic?

110
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:13,490
Speaker 0: I had a lot to talk about this weekend is the New York comic-con in the Jacob Javits Center in New York City.

111
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:17,204
Speaker 0: Friday Saturday Sunday, we could go Thursday, but I don't think I'm gonna.

112
00:07:17,345 --> 00:07:17,726

Speaker 0: we could go do press stuff if we wanted.

116
00:07:21,706 --> 00:07:22,530
Speaker 1: I have to go to work.

117
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,044
Speaker 0: There's interviews.

118
00:07:23,065 --> 00:07:24,013
Speaker 0: yeah I have to to the press.

119
00:07:24,253 --> 00:07:31,886
Speaker 0: the press thing closes at 5. so theoretically if I left work a little early and took a cab I Could do like a half hours worth of pressy stuff.

120
00:07:31,947 --> 00:07:32,450
Speaker 1: not worth it.

121
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:35,938
Speaker 0: But Friday Saturday Sunday New York comic-con.

122
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:38,347
Speaker 0: it's probably if you're gonna go to something like this.

123
00:07:38,387 --> 00:07:43,457
Speaker 0: I'm gonna tell you straight up it's really only worth it to go to one day because You're gonna want to do.

124
00:07:43,477 --> 00:07:50,065
Speaker 0: you're gonna be able to do in one day unless well Specific events that are on days other than the one day you go that you want to see.

125
00:07:50,145 --> 00:07:55,745
Speaker 1: yeah unlike a lot of other Comic-cons you know this one actually has a crazy number of events.

126
00:07:55,785 --> 00:07:57,290
Speaker 1: the schedules in a PDF online.

127
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,800
Speaker 0: It's a lot more like an anime con in that regard.

128
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,234
Speaker 1: well kind of but they just have a shit ton Number of events.

129
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,963
Speaker 1: so most of them are industry events.

130
00:08:05,023 --> 00:08:15,239
Speaker 1: like you know it's basically Like you go and sit there for a half hour while people from a company like advertise their product to you You know or like say hey buy our new comic.

131
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,229
Speaker 1: the craters here talking about the new comic to make you want to buy it.

132
00:08:18,872 --> 00:08:22,597
Speaker 1: So a lot of the events don't really count in my book But there are like.

133
00:08:22,617 --> 00:08:24,330
Speaker 1: I think there's over 200 events at this con.

134
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:33,318
Speaker 1: It's crazy, but unless you care about the events if you do like comics right you should and you're in New York And you you know you don't go to comic-cons too often.

135
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,706
Speaker 1: You probably should go to the comic-con.

136
00:08:35,746 --> 00:08:47,010
Speaker 1: It should take you maybe Three hours at most maybe four because it's bigger than last year to sort of walk around See all the booths see the whole artist alley and all that business.

137
00:08:47,251 --> 00:08:47,513
Speaker 1: You know.

138
00:08:47,613 --> 00:08:57,745
Speaker 1: if there's no particular events you want and to do that I think is worth it especially if you have kids and you go on Sunday and the kids I think are 12 or under maybe 13 or I'm not sure they get in free.

139
00:08:57,825 --> 00:08:58,870
Speaker 1: so cuz it's kids day.

140
00:08:59,256 --> 00:09:07,809
Speaker 0: Beyond that TMR TM Revolution is doing a concert there and the price of admission for one day to this convention is well worth seeing.

141
00:09:07,849 --> 00:09:12,458
Speaker 0: a live Concert especially from a pretty good guy Yep, but speaking of TMR.

142
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,270
Speaker 0: We weren't going to go to the comic-con in any official.

143
00:09:15,351 --> 00:09:19,280
Speaker 1: I was gonna go maybe Friday night But not in any official capacity like we.

144
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:32,509
Speaker 0: we kind of burned ourselves out with a million cons And we got every con in the freaking world this summer, so we were gonna just like show up to this one maybe say hi to some people chill a little bit do a little bit of our press blah blah blah and then go home.

145
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:35,440
Speaker 0: but One thing led to another and for one repress.

146
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,230
Speaker 0: we're gonna actually be doing the press thing and you get me that badge.

147
00:09:38,472 --> 00:09:40,125
Speaker 0: Well, I got a press badge.

148
00:09:40,186 --> 00:09:40,670
Speaker 1: good job.

149
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,480
Speaker 1: See if you get always seem to you know fail to.

150
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,768
Speaker 1: when talking to people mention that there's two.

151
00:09:45,788 --> 00:09:45,848
Speaker 1: now.

152
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:51,669
Speaker 0: It's more that they most people see no reason for more than one reporter from any given group to show up.

153
00:09:52,751 --> 00:09:55,037
Speaker 0: Yeah, besides when is this ever happened before?

154
00:09:55,337 --> 00:10:00,190
Speaker 1: nah when quite a few times when I can't think of it for specific circumstance.

155
00:10:00,311 --> 00:10:02,389
Speaker 0: Is there ever been a time when I didn't get you a badge?

156
00:10:03,011 --> 00:10:09,398
Speaker 1: No, there have been times when now you've failed to mention that there are two of us Such as I'll remember in a minute.

157
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,123
Speaker 0: I'm curious when this has occurred.

158
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:16,509
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll continue with the show and then I'll remind Okay, cuz it's never happened This time either yet.

159
00:10:17,552 --> 00:10:18,335
Speaker 0: No, actually didn't.

160
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:21,890
Speaker 0: I said yes me and my co-host would like to come and then they gave me one press credential.

161
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:27,704
Speaker 0: uh-huh, but anyway We're gonna be going and doing the press II stuff but independent of that.

162
00:10:27,784 --> 00:10:33,640
Speaker 1: It's supposed to see my co-host and I Okay, yeah take that that's just cuz you have nothing.

163
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:41,865
Speaker 0: you're making stuff up and now you're trying to cover for it But you got nothing and when confronted with having nothing you got nothing to do.

164
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,150
Speaker 0: you got nothing to say.

165
00:10:43,391 --> 00:10:44,696
Speaker 1: That's all you've got.

166
00:10:44,736 --> 00:10:46,042
Speaker 1: continue while I remember.

167
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,709
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're gonna remember shit.

168
00:10:48,611 --> 00:11:05,100
Speaker 0: Anyway, the long story short is is that we also have our friends at Tokyo FM and We've set up this sort of event where we and them are going to be interviewing TM revolution at Kinokuniya bookstore on Sunday at 3 p.m.

169
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,584
Speaker 0: For Japanese radio.

170
00:11:06,844 --> 00:11:08,970
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, this is going to be pretty cool.

171
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:19,670
Speaker 0: I mean if you're going to this con and you want to see TM revolution They have their panel with Brian Nishi I think and all this stuff and you'll see the concert obviously But if you want to see him up close.

172
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:25,732
Speaker 0: You're probably better off going to Kinokuniya or at least you should go to the Kinokuniya thing at 3.

173
00:11:25,732 --> 00:11:28,484
Speaker 1: If you've never been to Kinokuniya, you should probably go there.

174
00:11:28,725 --> 00:11:31,166
Speaker 1: if you're going for the comic-con You should probably go to Kinokuniya.

175
00:11:31,872 --> 00:11:36,210
Speaker 0: Anyway, yes, cuz one if you're an anime fan or a manga fan, you've never been to a Japanese bookstore.

176
00:11:36,752 --> 00:11:43,292
Speaker 0: You're gonna realize there's a lot of stuff that's not in English that you would probably kill to be able to have a great English Selection.

177
00:11:43,433 --> 00:11:43,774
Speaker 0: they do.

178
00:11:44,176 --> 00:11:46,386
Speaker 1: you'd be saying I'm a brand new store in Bryant Park.

179
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:49,919
Speaker 1: That's crazy and Beyond that it's just fun to go to the store.

180
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,305
Speaker 0: If you're not an anime fan.

181
00:11:51,326 --> 00:11:53,529
Speaker 0: You're just a comic fan You're going to the comic-con.

182
00:11:54,891 --> 00:12:00,310
Speaker 0: You might want to go just to see all the different kinds of manga in Japanese comics that are out there.

183
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,432
Speaker 1: I mean Kinokuniya will have a booth at the con but you know They won't be.

184
00:12:03,452 --> 00:12:06,443
Speaker 1: that won't even be like a drop in the bucket compared to the store.

185
00:12:06,463 --> 00:12:06,925
Speaker 1: and it's not.

186
00:12:07,106 --> 00:12:09,882
Speaker 0: as I've seen with Scott You know, he's in the comic geeks big forums.

187
00:12:09,922 --> 00:12:15,260
Speaker 0: a lot of comic fans Automatically kind of dismiss manga and think it's one thing and don't see.

188
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,630
Speaker 0: well realize I think it's just comics from Japan.

189
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:21,583
Speaker 1: Well, I'm thinking you know more and more right that it's.

190
00:12:21,663 --> 00:12:26,002
Speaker 1: it's not like an either/or thing But I think that some people are fans of comics.

191
00:12:26,022 --> 00:12:30,920
Speaker 1: They like comics and all their forms, you know They don't care about you know, they like web comics.

192
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:31,984
Speaker 1: They like mangas.

193
00:12:32,024 --> 00:12:43,305
Speaker 1: They like your you know, they like comics You know, they like, you know sequential arts, right, but there are some people, you know They say I'm a fan of comics, but really they're not a fan of comics as a whole.

194
00:12:43,546 --> 00:12:44,750
Speaker 1: They're superhero fans.

195
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:48,950
Speaker 1: They're fans of you know, spider-man maybe you know and they actually you know.

196
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:54,992
Speaker 1: That's why you see all those comic stores selling toys and movies and cartoons on because they're you know These people.

197
00:12:55,253 --> 00:13:00,270
Speaker 1: they say they're comic fans and they go and buy comics every Wednesday, but really they're superhero fans.

198
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:06,470
Speaker 1: Now there are people, you know are somewhere in between like I'm a tiny superhero fan and a big comics fan.

199
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:19,923
Speaker 1: there's some people who are sort of like half and half or whatever, but I think that Even still the US comics industry with more than 50% of it if its weight relies on Superhero fandom as opposed to comics fandom.

200
00:13:20,023 --> 00:13:21,230
Speaker 0: I'm just saying all I want to say.

201
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,557
Speaker 0: My only point is that if you don't.

202
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:25,397
Speaker 0: if you think you don't like manga you think you know What manga is.

203
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:26,166
Speaker 0: you don't really read it?

204
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:37,822
Speaker 0: Go to the Kinokuniya after the comic-con one the TMR thing will be cool and to Look at you're gonna see comics about like old men playing golf Really closely.

205
00:13:37,882 --> 00:13:41,790
Speaker 1: don't just sort of like stand back and see like a wall of crazy stuff and be like, ah, it's all crazy.

206
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:47,329
Speaker 1: Actually get in there and look at it like closely and examine all the different stuff even though you can't read it.

207
00:13:48,172 --> 00:13:50,260
Speaker 0: You know a lot of times you don't need to read it.

208
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,283
Speaker 0: that golf manga.

209
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:52,949
Speaker 0: I know exactly what's going on.

210
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,893
Speaker 1: I know exactly what.

211
00:13:53,913 --> 00:13:55,498
Speaker 1: I don't know the details but know in general.

212
00:13:55,859 --> 00:14:00,324
Speaker 0: Yeah, that guy's crying that guy's shot-putting That's all I need to know.

213
00:14:00,384 --> 00:14:02,501
Speaker 0: Yeah So yeah at 3 p.m.

214
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:08,803
Speaker 0: On Sunday at the Kinokuniya bookstore in New York City Brian Brian Park.

215
00:14:08,904 --> 00:14:09,205
Speaker 1: Yes.

216
00:14:09,245 --> 00:14:11,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can find Kinokuniya bookstore.

217
00:14:11,731 --> 00:14:14,801
Speaker 0: I'm sure you'll be able to get directions to it from the comic-con.

218
00:14:14,862 --> 00:14:20,003
Speaker 1: if you ask anyone if you go to the Kinokuniya booth At the comic-con, I'm sure they will tell you where their store is.

219
00:14:20,284 --> 00:14:21,430
Speaker 1: They'll be happy to tell you.

220
00:14:21,932 --> 00:14:26,650
Speaker 0: I'm glad the anime news network has mentioned this even though they didn't mention us despite us being in the press.

221
00:14:26,731 --> 00:14:28,106
Speaker 1: I think my news network hates us.

222
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:32,909
Speaker 0: They must you know, I guess now we'll find out if anyone from the anime news network listens or not.

223
00:14:33,351 --> 00:14:34,536
Speaker 0: Maybe I'm curious.

224
00:14:34,576 --> 00:14:36,845
Speaker 0: I really am because they got one thing going for them.

225
00:14:36,906 --> 00:14:37,649
Speaker 0: They got anime news.

226
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:44,556
Speaker 1: Nina Yeah, I mean is Nina's the best thing on that website actually animates new work, you know You know, I guess there's.

227
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:50,455
Speaker 1: you could you could criticize them about some things but really they're the only Game attack like in the end.

228
00:14:50,475 --> 00:14:52,882
Speaker 1: They're not doing that bad in the anime press world.

229
00:14:53,243 --> 00:14:55,590
Speaker 0: They're effectively the AP wire.

230
00:14:55,710 --> 00:15:01,650
Speaker 0: They're the wire that at least the English anime press world because the English anime press world is a sad sad world.

231
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,492
Speaker 0: There's almost nothing.

232
00:15:02,854 --> 00:15:07,287
Speaker 0: There's I mean what we are right there after the anime news network.

233
00:15:07,347 --> 00:15:08,390
Speaker 0: They say something happened.

234
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,618
Speaker 0: We say rabble rabble about something that happened.

235
00:15:10,678 --> 00:15:16,252
Speaker 1: I mean, it's anime news service calm, but they haven't updated since September 2007.

236
00:15:16,252 --> 00:15:20,530
Speaker 0: I have some ideas about how to make the anime press better, but it's a show for another time.

237
00:15:20,935 --> 00:15:21,889
Speaker 1: Just have a competitor.

238
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:26,349
Speaker 1: No, I have a lot of people who speak Japanese working for you.

239
00:15:26,651 --> 00:15:29,910
Speaker 0: I actually have some very specific ideas that involve some friends of ours.

240
00:15:31,413 --> 00:15:32,017
Speaker 1: So I got.

241
00:15:32,037 --> 00:15:34,210
Speaker 1: I got some news here from anime news network.

242
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,554
Speaker 1: I haven't done an anime news network.

243
00:15:35,654 --> 00:15:41,270
Speaker 0: actually my other news is from slash dot but it's actually from the anime news.

244
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:41,793
Speaker 1: Now you have.

245
00:15:41,813 --> 00:15:42,576
Speaker 1: you have another news?

246
00:15:42,777 --> 00:15:43,682
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you can go first.

247
00:15:43,782 --> 00:15:44,104
Speaker 1: Okay.

248
00:15:44,405 --> 00:15:45,370
Speaker 1: I thought that was just your news.

249
00:15:45,471 --> 00:15:46,544
Speaker 0: No, I got a couple of things.

250
00:15:46,706 --> 00:15:50,810
Speaker 1: Okay Yeah, so in Korea, right?

251
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:55,906
Speaker 1: There's some people they want to make a movie about Captain Harlock, which is awesome.

252
00:15:55,927 --> 00:16:06,279
Speaker 1: All right Captain Harlock was created by Leiji Matsumoto who created Yamato and Galaxy Express and he did that the movie with Daft Punk interstellar whatnot?

253
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,889
Speaker 1: five five five five five five five five.

254
00:16:09,251 --> 00:16:11,156
Speaker 1: He's pretty awesome.

255
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:17,976
Speaker 1: As far as anime making dudes go right one of the number but easily top five easily.

256
00:16:18,097 --> 00:16:24,849
Speaker 1: so in Korea though, they want to make a Carlock movie when they have a budget of like a hundred million dollars.

257
00:16:25,806 --> 00:16:31,582
Speaker 1: But Matsumoto says hey, I didn't say they could do that.

258
00:16:31,602 --> 00:16:33,166
Speaker 1: What what's going on?

259
00:16:33,186 --> 00:16:47,990
Speaker 1: And It's kind of you know, and okay, that's that's all there is to the news, but It's I find it kind of funny that Japan the country where you know Do jinchi is so hot so allowed, right?

260
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:53,908
Speaker 1: It's like oh if you want to use my characters to create your own artistic work and profit from it.

261
00:16:53,948 --> 00:16:54,570
Speaker 0: Go right ahead.

262
00:16:54,690 --> 00:17:00,290
Speaker 0: I think part of it's because they seem to tolerate that up to the point of large professional operations.

263
00:17:00,351 --> 00:17:02,071
Speaker 1: Well, yeah now see here's the thing It's like.

264
00:17:02,513 --> 00:17:04,780
Speaker 1: where are they exactly drawing the line here?

265
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,541
Speaker 1: because in the u.s.

266
00:17:05,582 --> 00:17:09,439
Speaker 1: We draw the line at you are making money You are not making money.

267
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:11,169
Speaker 1: I think that's a pretty clear line, right?

268
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,694
Speaker 1: But there's no jinchi people.

269
00:17:12,734 --> 00:17:13,659
Speaker 1: you see a comic kit.

270
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,346
Speaker 1: They're making a profit.

271
00:17:15,386 --> 00:17:16,349
Speaker 1: They're not making a large.

272
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,655
Speaker 0: Well, actually the line in the u.s.

273
00:17:17,694 --> 00:17:18,598
Speaker 0: Isn't even that clear?

274
00:17:18,657 --> 00:17:22,571
Speaker 0: because technically you're infringing even if you're not making money I know.

275
00:17:22,592 --> 00:17:24,339
Speaker 0: I know some people do go after you.

276
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,665
Speaker 1: Yes, that is true.

277
00:17:26,348 --> 00:17:34,530
Speaker 1: However in Japan right they see they allow people to do this while making you know small to moderate profits.

278
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:38,527
Speaker 1: But it's suddenly when you know, they're spending a hundred million dollars.

279
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:39,310
Speaker 1: That does a problem.

280
00:17:39,451 --> 00:17:41,020
Speaker 1: Well, what if I spent fifty million dollars?

281
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,865
Speaker 1: Would that be a problem?

282
00:17:41,905 --> 00:17:42,670
Speaker 1: How about one million?

283
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:46,247
Speaker 1: How much is how much you know, what is the scale where on the scale?

284
00:17:46,327 --> 00:17:46,930
Speaker 1: Is it suddenly?

285
00:17:47,652 --> 00:17:48,054
Speaker 0: One of those?

286
00:17:48,396 --> 00:17:53,950
Speaker 0: technically you shouldn't do it, but we're all cool with it But we might not be cool with it in the future and there's a lot like that.

287
00:17:54,131 --> 00:17:58,090
Speaker 1: It seems just you know, it seems as a as a moral thing.

288
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,541
Speaker 1: It seems they're very inconsistent and they're just sort of.

289
00:18:00,682 --> 00:18:09,058
Speaker 0: but we're just as inconsistent I know but the only difference between us in Japan is that our inconsistency line is Equally wide but much lower.

290
00:18:09,198 --> 00:18:20,787
Speaker 1: Yes, but it's very hypocritical of you know A single person because I'm sure there's plenty of Harlock dojinshe's out there that me that Matsumoto's not cracking down on maybe not maybe he hates all of them.

291
00:18:20,847 --> 00:18:22,835
Speaker 0: That's possible Sits up at night.

292
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:25,285
Speaker 0: Just how can I get those bastards?

293
00:18:25,345 --> 00:18:26,530
Speaker 1: How can I get those bastards?

294
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:32,189
Speaker 1: They don't know how to draw my tell properly girl But I'm sure he's not going after them.

295
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:32,792
Speaker 1: You know, I don't.

296
00:18:32,852 --> 00:18:33,354
Speaker 1: I guess I don't.

297
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:40,010
Speaker 1: I'm not a hundred percent sure on this, but I'm pretty sure there's plenty of dojinshe's of Matsumoto's characters.

298
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:49,566
Speaker 0: But at the same time if you're making a movie off real movie with a studio You should probably at least ask the copyright, right?

299
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,233
Speaker 1: All right, that's true I'm not.

300
00:18:51,353 --> 00:18:55,570
Speaker 1: I'm not saying these Korean people are doing great at this point, you know, plus the you know.

301
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:59,484
Speaker 1: This is only gonna get worse from here as you know, let me look at us.

302
00:18:59,504 --> 00:19:07,829
Speaker 1: They're podcasting right now, right as amateur media production Right and professional media production get closer and closer to each other.

303
00:19:08,251 --> 00:19:09,998
Speaker 1: Where's the line gonna be?

304
00:19:10,018 --> 00:19:10,761
Speaker 1: you're not gonna be.

305
00:19:10,821 --> 00:19:14,636
Speaker 1: you know, if you say it's okay for amateurs It's not okay for professionals.

306
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:19,218
Speaker 1: Well as amateurs are able to make professional products You know, what?

307
00:19:19,339 --> 00:19:20,530
Speaker 1: what really is your distinction?

308
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,261
Speaker 1: Well, I've seen really whimsical and subjective.

309
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:24,828
Speaker 1: deciding who to pick on.

310
00:19:24,848 --> 00:19:29,370
Speaker 0: the way It's usually determined is simply by the scale of distribution.

311
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,650
Speaker 0: If I make a hundred dojinshe's no one cares.

312
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,977
Speaker 1: But what if I find my doji and put it on the Internet's?

313
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:39,472
Speaker 1: that's that's different because that's not that's the biggest scale of distribution You can get.

314
00:19:39,573 --> 00:19:41,581
Speaker 0: yes, but no one pays attention to that.

315
00:19:41,602 --> 00:19:47,162
Speaker 0: or because not yet at least Yeah, it just seems like cuz then you're not making money off of it.

316
00:19:47,402 --> 00:19:48,506
Speaker 1: You could be so.

317
00:19:48,527 --> 00:19:50,493
Speaker 0: you're selling it online Possible.

318
00:19:50,513 --> 00:19:51,640
Speaker 0: Well, how many do you sell?

319
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,290
Speaker 0: You'd probably sell more of your selling in person.

320
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:58,849
Speaker 0: Maybe you could sell memberships to your doubt your doujinshi downloading site And I don't know how many people would pay for that.

321
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:02,227
Speaker 1: I don't know if you had a really good doujinshi's in English and there were lots of them.

322
00:20:02,307 --> 00:20:02,729
Speaker 1: I might pay.

323
00:20:03,091 --> 00:20:03,855
Speaker 0: I just don't know.

324
00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:06,066
Speaker 0: not as much of a hypocritical issues.

325
00:20:06,086 --> 00:20:06,890
Speaker 0: You're making it out to be.

326
00:20:07,493 --> 00:20:10,810
Speaker 1: I just think Japan really needs to straighten out their their situation.

327
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,343
Speaker 0: I think the US needs to straighten out it's situation.

328
00:20:13,423 --> 00:20:14,790
Speaker 1: Everyone needs to straighten out the situation.

329
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:20,996
Speaker 1: I think Japan has a little worse and I also think that This this movie.

330
00:20:21,016 --> 00:20:22,924
Speaker 1: I hope they make it because it sounds like awesome.

331
00:20:23,467 --> 00:20:23,949
Speaker 0: I don't know.

332
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:28,107
Speaker 1: I mean, you don't know a hundred million dollar Harlock movie can't go wrong.

333
00:20:28,368 --> 00:20:28,750
Speaker 0: We'll see.

334
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,016
Speaker 0: I've seen some hundred million dollar movies in my day.

335
00:20:31,036 --> 00:20:33,843
Speaker 1: There's a lack of Movies.

336
00:20:33,863 --> 00:20:35,148
Speaker 1: I will take what I can get.

337
00:20:35,469 --> 00:20:36,614
Speaker 0: What are you talking about?

338
00:20:36,855 --> 00:20:37,919
Speaker 0: There's tons of movies.

339
00:20:38,982 --> 00:20:39,584
Speaker 0: What movies?

340
00:20:39,684 --> 00:20:40,086
Speaker 0: what do you mean?

341
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:40,749
Speaker 0: What movies?

342
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,500
Speaker 0: Well, we've never even seen strange days.

343
00:20:43,781 --> 00:20:44,604
Speaker 1: I'm talking about like.

344
00:20:44,764 --> 00:20:46,270
Speaker 1: I'm talking about the anime movie.

345
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,414
Speaker 0: Oh anime movies.

346
00:20:47,574 --> 00:20:50,287
Speaker 0: Yeah, but isn't this a live-action Is it?

347
00:20:50,569 --> 00:20:51,394
Speaker 1: no, I don't think so.

348
00:20:51,595 --> 00:20:52,058
Speaker 0: Are you sure?

349
00:20:53,240 --> 00:21:03,993
Speaker 1: Uh Into a film something so it doesn't actually say, uh-huh Yeah, huh, that's a good question Captain news.

350
00:21:04,254 --> 00:21:06,201
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't say live-action or not.

351
00:21:06,582 --> 00:21:10,686
Speaker 1: You know what if it's live-action double awesome That would be sweet live-action Harlock.

352
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:15,557
Speaker 0: Anyway, I want to really briefly mention this.

353
00:21:15,597 --> 00:21:20,432
Speaker 0: just because it was brought up in the anime press and a lot of people lost their shit over it.

354
00:21:20,973 --> 00:21:21,796
Speaker 0: some kind of know how.

355
00:21:21,816 --> 00:21:28,283
Speaker 0: I used RF IDs and I saw a lot of rabble on the internet rambling about oh My god, I'd never go to a con that did that.

356
00:21:28,303 --> 00:21:30,454
Speaker 0: All I have to say is chill Totally chill.

357
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:33,130
Speaker 0: eventually every convention in the world is going to be doing that.

358
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,998
Speaker 0: It's just a matter of the technology getting better.

359
00:21:35,018 --> 00:21:37,369
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's a good thing and I'll leave it at that.

360
00:21:37,771 --> 00:21:38,659
Speaker 1: No, you see that's all.

361
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,769
Speaker 0: I guess that's all I'm gonna say.

362
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:43,725
Speaker 1: You're not gonna talk about RFID technology and how it works and what oh god.

363
00:21:43,785 --> 00:21:44,990
Speaker 0: No, that's a Monday show.

364
00:21:45,352 --> 00:21:46,962
Speaker 1: All right, we should do a Monday on RFID.

365
00:21:47,103 --> 00:21:51,990
Speaker 1: It's pretty simple though Yeah, but I guess we could talk a lot about not just the technology of it, but the implications.

366
00:21:52,191 --> 00:22:05,309
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz the technology is really really really really yeah and the uses for it and you know when you should worry when you should Things of the day.

367
00:22:06,332 --> 00:22:10,270
Speaker 0: While ago, we used an awesome awesome sumo fight as a thing of the day.

368
00:22:10,693 --> 00:22:17,349
Speaker 0: This one is not technically as awesome But in many ways it is more awesome and I will leave it at that.

369
00:22:18,093 --> 00:22:22,069
Speaker 1: I really think that what was done it to the in this video that you're gonna see.

370
00:22:22,772 --> 00:22:27,250
Speaker 1: I really think that we should develop a technology that does this in real time.

371
00:22:27,991 --> 00:22:33,690
Speaker 1: Football exact adds it in real time to all sports all sports on television.

372
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:46,594
Speaker 0: And if you thought that I remember when you should patent that idea before you invented I remember in hockey when they added the glow puck the glow puck and then they added the comic the comment whenever someone shot Yeah, the fire.

373
00:22:46,614 --> 00:22:50,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I remember thinking wow, that's really stupid.

374
00:22:50,231 --> 00:22:53,030
Speaker 1: It was cool for like five minutes and then it wasn't cool anymore.

375
00:22:53,231 --> 00:22:56,867
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the one thing is it did make it a little bit easier to see the puck.

376
00:22:56,907 --> 00:22:57,972
Speaker 1: when they're a bunch of guys It's out.

377
00:22:58,032 --> 00:23:01,530
Speaker 0: Well in the pre HD era it was critical for watching sports on.

378
00:23:01,611 --> 00:23:16,030
Speaker 1: Yeah You realize like hockey was one of the first things ever put in HD because Madison Square Garden the building which is where the rain New York Rangers, New York Knicks basketball play right is owned by cable vision, which is the people who give us cable here.

379
00:23:16,351 --> 00:23:23,542
Speaker 1: And so cable vision actually has a TV channel called MSG which basically shows Rangers and Knicks games.

380
00:23:24,066 --> 00:23:26,796
Speaker 1: and I Remember we had cable vision.

381
00:23:27,237 --> 00:23:33,065
Speaker 1: and the first thing that was ever in HD like way before Like HD was even popular.

382
00:23:33,085 --> 00:23:37,964
Speaker 1: like we're talking Mid to late 90s here like before most people even knew HD before.

383
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:41,055
Speaker 1: there are any standards before anyone knew 720p or anything like that.

384
00:23:41,517 --> 00:23:44,850
Speaker 1: if you had bought an HD TV in those days, it probably wouldn't work nowadays.

385
00:23:45,352 --> 00:23:48,849
Speaker 1: But New York Rangers hockey was like the first thing ever in HD.

386
00:23:49,492 --> 00:23:55,356
Speaker 1: And if you actually went to Madison Square Garden and HD TVs all around and you could you know You know what and he was like, wow, look at that.

387
00:23:55,556 --> 00:23:57,081
Speaker 0: Why leave this for sports.

388
00:23:57,463 --> 00:23:58,807
Speaker 0: We should add this to the news.

389
00:23:58,827 --> 00:24:03,177
Speaker 1: Oh That's cruel and funny.

390
00:24:03,377 --> 00:24:04,402
Speaker 0: anyway, okay.

391
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:05,767
Speaker 1: Oh my thing of the day, right?

392
00:24:06,088 --> 00:24:11,790
Speaker 1: Yeah So, you know when you're looking for a place to live this has nothing to do with anime or anything.

393
00:24:12,471 --> 00:24:16,190
Speaker 1: Is that this new thing of day out of nowhere, but I have a better thing a day for tomorrow.

394
00:24:16,311 --> 00:24:18,470
Speaker 1: So I didn't want to like, you know use this one tomorrow, whatever.

395
00:24:19,431 --> 00:24:24,890
Speaker 1: When you're looking for a place to live right the the two biggest things you got to worry about, right?

396
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:34,212
Speaker 1: I mean if you look at I look at my expense report on my accounting little program right two basic expenses right our rent and Transportation.

397
00:24:34,453 --> 00:24:40,310
Speaker 1: right those like the place you live and the thing that gets you to other places, especially if you commute to work, right?

398
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:50,843
Speaker 1: so When you pick a place to live it's like well I could move over here and the rent is $500 less a month But my transportation is gonna be $600 more a month.

399
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:54,179
Speaker 1: So I'm actually better off staying where I am.

400
00:24:54,199 --> 00:25:22,308
Speaker 1: All right, and there's other factors you have to take into account But here's an interesting website That begins to solve the problem of helping you figure out where the most economically efficient place to live is where you want to go and what they have is they show you Housing or housing plus transportation as A percentage of the median income in the area in a visual way on this map,

401
00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:22,769
Speaker 0: huh?

402
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:33,947
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you can look at this map in New York, right and you look like it's funny because you look at Manhattan Right and it's like tan means zero to thirty percent or you know, you can.

403
00:25:33,968 --> 00:25:34,730
Speaker 1: there's different options.

404
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:47,690
Speaker 1: You can choose, you know, but tan is like, you know, you're spending less than you know Some percent of your you know income on housing and transportation and blue is you're spending more than a certain percent of your.

405
00:25:48,051 --> 00:25:51,482
Speaker 1: You know stuff on housing and transportation and it's like, huh?

406
00:25:51,863 --> 00:25:55,776
Speaker 1: You see all these like blue specks in Manhattan You can tell like some areas.

407
00:25:56,017 --> 00:25:58,226
Speaker 1: It's like oh, yeah, that's that's a cheap place to live.

408
00:25:58,246 --> 00:26:00,704
Speaker 1: That's an expensive place to live That's the place where nobody lives.

409
00:26:00,724 --> 00:26:01,309
Speaker 1: All right.

410
00:26:02,274 --> 00:26:17,530
Speaker 1: And then as soon as you go up into the Bronx It's all tan and then as soon as you get up to like Yonkers Tarrytown It starts turning deep blue all the way up pretty much Splotches in the places where people don't live far away from highways and transportation.

411
00:26:18,593 --> 00:26:18,816
Speaker 0: Huh?

412
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,584
Speaker 1: Yeah.

413
00:26:19,948 --> 00:26:31,169
Speaker 0: Yeah well at least Scott and I are at the point and as with much of the front row crew where we really We can't live more than an hour away from a global like international city or there's no jobs for us.

414
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,173
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway, let's see.

415
00:26:33,193 --> 00:26:33,895
Speaker 1: I'm looking here.

416
00:26:33,915 --> 00:26:40,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually beacon is tan and Like the thing is Putnam County below us is blue.

417
00:26:41,502 --> 00:26:43,199
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, you want to know why?

418
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,728
Speaker 0: Yep, because we we tend.

419
00:26:45,748 --> 00:26:48,860
Speaker 0: I think we make actually a lot more money than the median for beacon right now.

420
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,726
Speaker 1: But the thing will tell you what the median income is Income for beacon.

421
00:26:52,746 --> 00:26:53,269
Speaker 0: What's it say?

422
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:54,857
Speaker 1: I got to go to the beacon area.

423
00:26:54,938 --> 00:26:55,400
Speaker 0: I'm curious.

424
00:26:55,601 --> 00:27:00,618
Speaker 1: Oh, actually it only tells you for New York North in New Jersey Long Island doesn't tell you for beacons.

425
00:27:00,638 --> 00:27:01,280
Speaker 1: visit the map.

426
00:27:01,563 --> 00:27:02,979
Speaker 1: It's not perfect, but it's a start.

427
00:27:03,361 --> 00:27:05,027
Speaker 0: So then how's it even calculating up here?

428
00:27:05,047 --> 00:27:09,020
Speaker 1: it cuz it has I don't know but you don't tell me the number.

429
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:10,868
Speaker 0: I assume it's just making something up.

430
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:13,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, it'd be blue here a little purple here a little bit.

431
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:20,079
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah, it is an advanced mode that I haven't used but it's you know, it's interesting at the least.

432
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:20,902
Speaker 1: if it's not It's not.

433
00:27:21,103 --> 00:27:24,822
Speaker 1: you know that useful yet, but I definitely see it going places Right.

434
00:27:24,962 --> 00:27:29,740
Speaker 0: So we were gonna try to review Toki wa kakoto shoujo tonight, but Scott didn't watch it.

435
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:31,106
Speaker 1: How am I supposed to watch it?

436
00:27:31,347 --> 00:27:31,729
Speaker 1: I don't know.

00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:33,236
Speaker 1: train where is it?

438
00:27:33,376 --> 00:27:34,140
Speaker 0: we had it for you.

439
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,405
Speaker 0: We said several times you want it.

440
00:27:35,806 --> 00:27:36,428
Speaker 0: I'll give it to you.

441
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:37,653
Speaker 1: I'm reading books.

442
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:41,431
Speaker 0: Okay, and stuff Do you watch a Kazanoyo Jimbo yet?

00:27:44,948 --> 00:27:45,350
Speaker 1: I did.

447
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,199
Speaker 1: I watched as many as I watched before.

448
00:27:48,203 --> 00:27:49,086
Speaker 0: How about Baca now?

449
00:27:49,648 --> 00:27:51,774
Speaker 1: I watched as many as I watched before avatar.

450
00:27:52,136 --> 00:27:53,480
Speaker 0: No, okay great.

451
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,611
Speaker 0: So, uh, I guess instead since Scott won't watch anime.

452
00:27:56,651 --> 00:27:57,635
Speaker 0: I read some comic books.

453
00:27:57,996 --> 00:27:59,040
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that's right.

454
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:03,983
Speaker 0: I liked half of the series that I read All right.

455
00:28:04,003 --> 00:28:06,872
Speaker 0: So tonight first we're gonna talk about I. let's start with something.

456
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:07,234
Speaker 0: I liked.

457
00:28:07,254 --> 00:28:11,824
Speaker 0: All right, Scott handed me Invincible volume one.

458
00:28:11,864 --> 00:28:14,451
Speaker 1: so invincible is written by Robert Kirkman.

459
00:28:14,491 --> 00:28:16,596
Speaker 1: Who's the the Walking Dead guy, right?

460
00:28:16,997 --> 00:28:23,515
Speaker 1: He also did that at the The the Wolfman comic on free comic book day that I didn't like.

461
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,560
Speaker 1: that was terrible, right?

462
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:26,568
Speaker 1: So I had heard about invincible.

463
00:28:26,628 --> 00:28:30,286
Speaker 1: people kept talking it up talking it up talking it up Right, and I'm like, all right, whatever.

464
00:28:30,527 --> 00:28:32,194
Speaker 1: I'll buy the first trade paperback.

465
00:28:32,535 --> 00:28:33,600
Speaker 1: It can't hurt, right?

466
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,732
Speaker 1: I mean, I'll try it, you know, and I don't knock things till I try them.

467
00:28:37,275 --> 00:28:40,664
Speaker 1: So I bought the first one and It's not deep.

468
00:28:41,205 --> 00:28:42,490
Speaker 1: It's not serious.

469
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:42,831
Speaker 1: It's not.

470
00:28:42,871 --> 00:28:43,895
Speaker 1: it's not like the Watchmen.

471
00:28:43,935 --> 00:28:45,300
Speaker 1: It's not a comic for all time.

472
00:28:46,161 --> 00:28:50,600
Speaker 1: It's just sort of plain and fun and bright and happy and I liked it.

473
00:28:51,022 --> 00:28:56,267
Speaker 1: It's sort of just like a nice diversion like ah I think the only real like.

474
00:28:56,327 --> 00:29:00,540
Speaker 0: I liked it partly because it was it so clearly did not take itself seriously.

475
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,685
Speaker 0: I'm just like, yeah, whatever.

476
00:29:01,705 --> 00:29:02,831
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's go.

477
00:29:02,891 --> 00:29:07,030
Speaker 0: Let's go funny funny funny and One thing it uses the dot eyes a lot.

478
00:29:07,271 --> 00:29:12,375
Speaker 0: Yeah dot eyes the thing I think that's a good half of why I like Nana was the dot eyes.

479
00:29:12,476 --> 00:29:12,858
Speaker 0: Yeah.

480
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,424
Speaker 1: Yeah Do you want to summarize the plot?

481
00:29:14,464 --> 00:29:15,387
Speaker 1: we can summarize the plot.

482
00:29:15,427 --> 00:29:19,340
Speaker 0: whatever world of superheroes kid becomes a superhero because his dad's a superhero.

483
00:29:20,169 --> 00:29:21,140
Speaker 0: The mom is awesome.

484
00:29:21,501 --> 00:29:23,647
Speaker 0: yeah, basically they fight crime.

485
00:29:23,927 --> 00:29:32,699
Speaker 1: his dad is basically like Superman and then as he grows up eventually he Gets powers and he's like, I got some my superpowers and they're like, that's nice dear.

486
00:29:34,442 --> 00:29:35,345
Speaker 1: And it's you know, he's.

487
00:29:35,506 --> 00:29:48,063
Speaker 1: he's dealing with sort of normal high school life and has all the classic You know tropes of a superhero story, you know keeping your identity secret, you know Teams of other people, you know All this stuff.

488
00:29:48,444 --> 00:29:50,932
Speaker 1: but everyone it just sort of doesn't?

489
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:51,855
Speaker 1: it doesn't?

490
00:29:52,156 --> 00:29:53,580
Speaker 1: it treats it in a different way.

491
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:59,467
Speaker 1: it's just sort of like every people act normally despite living in a Stereotypical situation.

492
00:29:59,848 --> 00:30:02,640
Speaker 0: It's so light and it's it's funny.

493
00:30:02,781 --> 00:30:07,726
Speaker 0: Just the one part that I laughed out loud is at the end near the end Where the dad comes home.

494
00:30:07,746 --> 00:30:13,079
Speaker 0: dad comes home and you just see like his tattered arm Poking and he's like I need to shave.

495
00:30:13,341 --> 00:30:17,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically this is one point at which the dad gets sucked into another universe, right?

496
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,780
Speaker 1: And you know the whole time you see, you know, the mom usually doesn't worry that much.

497
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:34,280
Speaker 1: You know, I mean now how much can you worry when your husband is Superman, but you know, he's flying around You know the world saving people and stuff and he's not home all the time and he's always running off and you know But you get sucked into another dimension.

498
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:41,660
Speaker 1: So then the mom is like I always worry when he gets sucked in another dimension and you see the mom being awesome Right, and then you're like, huh?

499
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,014
Speaker 1: I wonder if they're gonna keep him sucked into that other dimension for how long?

500
00:30:45,034 --> 00:30:46,420
Speaker 1: and I wonder if he's ever gonna come back.

501
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,143
Speaker 1: You know, are they gonna?

502
00:30:47,425 --> 00:30:48,088
Speaker 1: and I was like, huh?

503
00:30:48,108 --> 00:30:50,700
Speaker 1: If they had him die, that would be sort of obvious.

504
00:30:51,542 --> 00:30:55,199
Speaker 1: And then I'm like, oh they just had him show up, you know They're all and you know.

505
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:00,480
Speaker 1: Then it would be also sort of lame though and it has brought him back at exactly the right time in a humorous fashion.

506
00:31:01,561 --> 00:31:03,693
Speaker 0: But the thing is other than that, I mean what else can I say?

507
00:31:03,733 --> 00:31:04,115
Speaker 0: It's funny.

508
00:31:04,135 --> 00:31:04,598
Speaker 0: It's clever.

509
00:31:04,638 --> 00:31:04,940
Speaker 0: It's cute.

510
00:31:05,161 --> 00:31:06,246
Speaker 0: I don't know if I'd read anymore.

511
00:31:06,307 --> 00:31:08,860
Speaker 0: I think I already got everything I could ever get out of this kind of comic.

512
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,030
Speaker 1: Well, this is this isn't the kind of comic right?

513
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,317
Speaker 1: There's some comics like.

514
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:21,836
Speaker 1: they're so great All right that you just run out and get all of them and you read them all straight through right invincible You know, I don't think I'm gonna run out and get them all and read them straight through.

515
00:31:21,876 --> 00:31:23,659
Speaker 1: that seems like that Seems like a bad idea.

516
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:31,686
Speaker 1: But I mean if I was sitting around going like doo doo doo doo and I felt like just a fun comic, you know And I didn't have one available.

517
00:31:31,746 --> 00:31:32,409
Speaker 1: I might be like, huh?

518
00:31:33,173 --> 00:31:34,620
Speaker 1: I could use something fun right now.

519
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:38,499
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll go by the second one and see if it's it's as fun as the first one.

520
00:31:38,842 --> 00:31:41,780
Speaker 0: It doesn't have a lot of those little you know comic book cameos.

521
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:47,800
Speaker 0: I mean the nerd that gets beat up in the beginning is clearly Steve Urkel and later on you see like Charlie Brown walking by.

522
00:31:48,421 --> 00:31:49,304
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know funny.

523
00:31:49,344 --> 00:31:51,950
Speaker 1: So it's just totally you know fun.

524
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:54,015
Speaker 1: It's it's not serious.

525
00:31:54,256 --> 00:31:55,720
Speaker 1: It's just kind of hey, what's up?

526
00:31:55,901 --> 00:31:56,553
Speaker 1: Totally cool.

527
00:31:57,643 --> 00:31:58,646
Speaker 0: And say it's worth reading.

528
00:31:58,807 --> 00:32:02,039
Speaker 0: Yeah now Scott was amazed when I came back and said hey, I liked it.

529
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,955
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we handed me this Marvel team up and said if you like that you like this right.

530
00:32:06,995 --> 00:32:10,590
Speaker 1: so Marvel team up is written By also what we're talking about.

531
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:10,811
Speaker 1: There's.

532
00:32:10,891 --> 00:32:12,680
Speaker 1: no there's more than one Marvel team up here.

533
00:32:13,061 --> 00:32:17,196
Speaker 1: There's the old Marvel team up from way back in the day.

534
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:17,979
Speaker 1: Don't read that.

535
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,291
Speaker 1: There's a new Marvel team up.

536
00:32:20,351 --> 00:32:21,660
Speaker 1: It's relatively new.

537
00:32:21,741 --> 00:32:33,122
Speaker 1: it was from a few years ago right and You can buy it is in four trade paperbacks the whole series and it's also written by Robert Kirkman and it's sort of a fun Superhero book.

538
00:32:33,423 --> 00:32:39,322
Speaker 1: and the first I read the first two volumes and then it took a while before the third and the fourth volumes came out.

539
00:32:39,383 --> 00:32:41,558
Speaker 1: so, you know, that's I sort of read it that way.

540
00:32:41,578 --> 00:32:52,606
Speaker 1: and The first two volumes I think you know in my opinion They're a lot like invincible only they have Marvel superheroes instead of you know Original invincible superheroes.

541
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:59,510
Speaker 0: see I guess the thing that I guess got me about is that on the surface that might seem true But if I read it, it's so.

542
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:01,460
Speaker 0: it takes itself seriously.

543
00:33:03,762 --> 00:33:09,880
Speaker 1: I think in the starting around the the third volume is because the third volume is way different than the first and second.

544
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:16,563
Speaker 1: Right, it sort of takes out this big tangent and then the fourth one sort of ties them together and kind of an airway It's just.

545
00:33:16,623 --> 00:33:16,724
Speaker 0: it's.

546
00:33:16,824 --> 00:33:20,620
Speaker 0: so I don't know what I never really liked the whole the Marvel Universe.

547
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:25,240
Speaker 0: There's a billion superheroes and they all know each other and there's a billion super villains.

548
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:35,711
Speaker 0: I'll see that they all know each other and they all fight with each other and Like they fight a green guy and then someone who's news like is that the Hulk and spider-man is like no you dumbass That's so-and-so from such-and-such.

549
00:33:35,772 --> 00:33:37,140
Speaker 0: It's not the Hulk because of blah.

550
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:43,479
Speaker 1: See, that's why I kind of like the more at least the first two volumes of this Marvel team-up is because it's sort of.

551
00:33:44,061 --> 00:33:49,100
Speaker 1: It takes the mark, you know normal Marvel Comics take themselves like 10,000 times more seriously, right?

552
00:33:49,540 --> 00:34:01,940
Speaker 1: So it's just sort of like poking fun at you know, like it at the other Marvel Comics in a way But at the same time it's just having fun like it's like yeah, we don't need to worry about you know bullshit.

553
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:06,800
Speaker 1: But it also it's sort of like a truth in advertising kind of thing, you know.

554
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,580
Speaker 1: It's like you read another Marvel comic that takes itself so seriously, right?

555
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,772
Speaker 1: but it doesn't make sense.

556
00:34:12,831 --> 00:34:23,719
Speaker 1: because like if Really you expect me to believe that all these serious comics what you're saying is right Then that means there must be like a bajillion superheroes flying all over New York all the time, but we don't see that.

557
00:34:24,081 --> 00:34:26,770
Speaker 1: So it's like the serious comic doesn't make sense.

558
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:34,199
Speaker 1: So in this non serious Marvel team-up It's like they're just superheroes all over New York knowing each other as they should.

559
00:34:34,601 --> 00:34:41,646
Speaker 1: So it's it's sort of a weird thing and where yes, it takes itself less seriously yet somehow It makes more sense.

560
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:47,813
Speaker 1: And that is that is why I find at least the first two volumes of it enjoyable Yeah, but at the same time I feel like it just takes itself too.

561
00:34:47,914 --> 00:34:48,376
Speaker 0: Seriously.

562
00:34:48,396 --> 00:34:49,119
Speaker 0: There's too much of that.

563
00:34:49,641 --> 00:34:55,399
Speaker 0: I'm a superhero giving my monologue before the other guy describes what he's about to do and then does it.

564
00:34:55,924 --> 00:34:57,360
Speaker 1: I don't really notice that so much.

565
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,182
Speaker 0: There was a lot of.

566
00:34:58,202 --> 00:35:04,320
Speaker 0: there's a lot of needless exposition and expounding on the behalf of characters talking about what happened.

567
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,325
Speaker 0: And well, I'm gonna do this.

568
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:08,640
Speaker 1: a few things that did but I mean, it's not as it's not perfect.

569
00:35:08,741 --> 00:35:10,248
Speaker 1: I mean a few things that bothered me in.

570
00:35:10,328 --> 00:35:12,600
Speaker 1: it were like, you know, it's Marvel team-up, right?

571
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,557
Speaker 1: So it's all about you know characters teaming up.

572
00:35:15,161 --> 00:35:24,489
Speaker 1: But really they should have just had it be spider-man teaming up with different people because it when spider-man leaves like that because the most Fun part of the book is spider-man wisecracking at everybody.

573
00:35:24,509 --> 00:35:27,217
Speaker 1: All right, I always think that's funny when it's written.

574
00:35:27,238 --> 00:35:29,968
Speaker 0: Well, yeah Wasn't that funny?

575
00:35:30,009 --> 00:35:31,400
Speaker 0: It was kind of pedestrian.

576
00:35:31,681 --> 00:35:34,231
Speaker 1: Well, I like his wisecrack and I also like how.

577
00:35:34,291 --> 00:35:36,600
Speaker 1: it's just sort of like, you know, his life is kind of rough.

578
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,091
Speaker 1: It's like I'm gonna beat up some guys.

579
00:35:39,493 --> 00:35:41,020
Speaker 1: I dropped my donuts god damn it.

580
00:35:41,241 --> 00:35:49,740
Speaker 0: I just because a lot of the plot kind of behind that is so Serious compared to something like invincible where the way it was handled was a lot lighter.

581
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:55,898
Speaker 0: I didn't I couldn't get into it at all and I find myself just glazing over these long long speeches.

582
00:35:55,938 --> 00:36:04,245
Speaker 0: that people give Really notice that many long speeches going on like this kid here the kid who was the killer right in the beginning with his weird Power at the hands.

583
00:36:04,285 --> 00:36:10,100
Speaker 1: and all I thought I like I liked how when they revealed that that you know They give you this kid who's central to like the first story, right?

584
00:36:10,403 --> 00:36:12,220
Speaker 1: He's like a mutant and he's got crazy powers.

585
00:36:12,561 --> 00:36:15,633
Speaker 1: So they're trying to you know, like, you know, keep him from being too dangerous.

586
00:36:16,135 --> 00:36:17,440
Speaker 1: and you're like, oh, you know.

587
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,980
Speaker 1: And at first it seems like he's innocent.

588
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,691
Speaker 1: He doesn't realize he's all powerful and you know He's just sort of like a victim of his own mutant stuff.

589
00:36:23,751 --> 00:36:25,500
Speaker 1: and maybe they'll get him hooked up with the x-men.

590
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:25,761
Speaker 1: It'll be.

591
00:36:25,842 --> 00:36:26,344
Speaker 0: it was done.

592
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:28,616
Speaker 0: Well when he's like you should look in the other rooms, too.

593
00:36:28,898 --> 00:36:29,661
Speaker 1: Yeah I like.

594
00:36:29,681 --> 00:36:33,794
Speaker 0: at the same time that was serious and the rest of it like it.

595
00:36:33,814 --> 00:36:36,262
Speaker 0: just it didn't fit with what I wanted I guess.

596
00:36:36,843 --> 00:36:42,860
Speaker 0: Oh, well, it's like there's an example of what I don't like about these Marvel superhero the comics with these team-ups and whatever.

597
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,772
Speaker 0: Quoth Wolverine after a bunch of people were looking at him on the bus.

598
00:36:47,434 --> 00:36:47,715
Speaker 1: Yeah.

599
00:36:47,735 --> 00:36:50,207
Speaker 1: Yeah Wolverine on the bus I mean, come on was hilarious.

600
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:51,755
Speaker 1: Come on Wolverine on the bus.

601
00:36:51,775 --> 00:36:53,966
Speaker 0: That was great And I was this guy.

602
00:36:54,006 --> 00:36:56,718
Speaker 1: that's that's the thing is like Wolverine can't fly, right?

603
00:36:57,341 --> 00:37:00,095
Speaker 1: He doesn't have the blackbird or anything cuz he's nice in New York.

604
00:37:00,115 --> 00:37:01,160
Speaker 1: He's not in the new x-men.

605
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:04,757
Speaker 0: She's also on everyone's teams who has to get around to like all these places.

606
00:37:04,798 --> 00:37:05,260
Speaker 0: all the right.

607
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:08,632
Speaker 1: So, you know and that's what happens in a serious Marvel Comics.

608
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:10,840
Speaker 1: So in his non serious one, right?

609
00:37:11,381 --> 00:37:11,844
Speaker 1: They take.

610
00:37:12,025 --> 00:37:13,232
Speaker 1: well, what would be true?

611
00:37:13,252 --> 00:37:14,480
Speaker 1: Wolverine would take the bus.

612
00:37:14,761 --> 00:37:19,520
Speaker 1: So it's like the thing that makes sense is humorous, especially because this one guy's looking at him.

613
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,989
Speaker 0: He's like, what are you looking at?

614
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,076
Speaker 0: It's healing already.

615
00:37:22,136 --> 00:37:33,025
Speaker 0: Yeah Yep, but then he gets off the bus and he says all of the following in one speech bubble Frigging bolded tourists.

616
00:37:33,427 --> 00:37:35,193
Speaker 1: No, it does have some bolding in there.

617
00:37:35,273 --> 00:37:37,160
Speaker 0: act like they'd never seen a superhero before.

618
00:37:37,582 --> 00:37:41,080
Speaker 0: I saw Nova fly by bolded twice while we were on the bus.

619
00:37:41,321 --> 00:37:42,424
Speaker 0: This is bolded New York.

620
00:37:42,444 --> 00:37:47,299
Speaker 0: for Pete's sake you can't buy a bag without bumping into bolded speedball or bolded Darkhawk.

621
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,657
Speaker 0: now Why?

622
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:54,160
Speaker 0: Did he have to say all of that when he could have just said friggin tourists like these extra words?

623
00:37:54,460 --> 00:38:00,360
Speaker 0: I would bother me about superhero comics and - why did he have to name three proper nouns?

624
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:08,580
Speaker 0: Superheroes, it's like they named these three superheroes Just to get the people who know the universe and like those three superheroes to go.

625
00:38:09,181 --> 00:38:10,505
Speaker 0: Ah, he said the name of the superhero.

626
00:38:10,566 --> 00:38:13,895
Speaker 0: I like it's anime-con name a Pokemon syndrome.

627
00:38:14,156 --> 00:38:14,577
Speaker 1: It does.

628
00:38:14,678 --> 00:38:15,400
Speaker 1: it is in there.

629
00:38:15,561 --> 00:38:16,324
Speaker 0: I hate that.

630
00:38:16,384 --> 00:38:20,080
Speaker 0: like it stands out so shallowly and it bothers me so much.

631
00:38:20,207 --> 00:38:20,942
Speaker 1: Yeah I guess it.

632
00:38:21,062 --> 00:38:29,613
Speaker 1: I guess it stands out a little less to me because if you read the really old comic books like you read Some Stan Lee's that is like times a billion.

633
00:38:29,673 --> 00:38:31,862
Speaker 1: so I know I don't read them I know.

634
00:38:31,882 --> 00:38:34,478
Speaker 1: so when you read this one you barely even notice it.

635
00:38:35,285 --> 00:38:36,438
Speaker 1: It's it's totally relative.

636
00:38:36,901 --> 00:38:38,827
Speaker 1: But yeah invincible you know is the same feeling.

637
00:38:38,887 --> 00:38:42,680
Speaker 1: only I guess it doesn't have that because it's not a Marvel or a DC book.

638
00:38:43,203 --> 00:38:43,867
Speaker 0: I don't know the only point.

639
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:50,839
Speaker 0: I mean I read I'd like the first one for about 20 pages and I kind of phased out and I skipped the third one after trying to read it.

640
00:38:51,522 --> 00:38:57,858
Speaker 0: And then the fourth one was I like the ring thing at the end when the guy cool guy has the ring And he does what any cool guy would do.

641
00:38:58,562 --> 00:39:00,628
Speaker 0: But then they kind of superhero comic.

642
00:39:00,668 --> 00:39:02,633
Speaker 0: if I it and it goes nowhere.

643
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:03,516
Speaker 0: I was interested in.

644
00:39:03,536 --> 00:39:07,690
Speaker 0: there's all this epic Superhero crap and I yeah.

645
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:12,206
Speaker 1: when they're like all out in the middle of nowhere and his giant bat Yeah, that was kind of a. I didn't like that.

646
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,049
Speaker 0: none of that was like.

647
00:39:13,089 --> 00:39:16,100
Speaker 0: wow just superheroes and underwear perfect costumes fighting.

648
00:39:16,663 --> 00:39:18,190
Speaker 0: It's lost all the charm.

649
00:39:18,492 --> 00:39:20,080
Speaker 0: I don't care about all this plot.

650
00:39:20,461 --> 00:39:22,447
Speaker 0: Why is everyone so serious then?

651
00:39:22,467 --> 00:39:26,018
Speaker 0: at the very end they kind of redeem it with an okay joke.

652
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:28,386
Speaker 1: yeah But I definitely think Marvel team up.

653
00:39:28,406 --> 00:39:32,138
Speaker 1: the first two volumes are where it shines and volume three is the crapper in.

654
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:36,995
Speaker 1: volume four Is a little bit better than the crapper, but yeah, it's the same thing anyway.

655
00:39:37,015 --> 00:39:37,978
Speaker 1: Do you wanna tell anything else?

656
00:39:38,439 --> 00:39:38,560
Speaker 0: no?

657
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,482
Speaker 0: I think we're done here.

658
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:40,887
Speaker 1: That was pretty quick.

659
00:39:41,348 --> 00:39:41,890
Speaker 0: Not really.

660
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,856
Speaker 0: no no all right.

661
00:39:43,876 --> 00:39:45,140
Speaker 0: standard geek nights episode.

662
00:39:45,723 --> 00:39:48,360
Speaker 1: Okay good thing else is I'll try I'll watch an anime for next week.

663
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,043
Speaker 1: I guess all right.

664
00:39:49,063 --> 00:39:52,620
Speaker 1: I don't know when though cuz he'd be doing this comic-con all weekend on the train.

665
00:39:52,781 --> 00:39:54,879
Speaker 0: That's how I watch all of like all these shows.

666
00:39:55,665 --> 00:39:57,740
Speaker 1: Then I got to bring my optical drive.

667
00:39:58,122 --> 00:40:08,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, well not for the fansubs bokurano and tokiwakakator shoujo And I don't have the fansubs for any of those again, but my I only have a flash drive in my laptop.

668
00:40:08,901 --> 00:40:09,606
Speaker 1: I can't fit them all.

669
00:40:09,747 --> 00:40:11,299
Speaker 0: all of bokurano was like four gigs.

670
00:40:12,442 --> 00:40:13,570
Speaker 1: That's a lot.

671
00:40:13,591 --> 00:40:14,699
Speaker 0: take half at a time.

672
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:20,919
Speaker 0: So hard to watch anime these days it takes so long to watch it, but it's good.

673
00:40:22,825 --> 00:40:27,959
Speaker 0: You could watch an equal volume of comics in the same time And actually I can read really fast.

674
00:40:28,582 --> 00:40:29,405
Speaker 1: That's the thing plus.

675
00:40:29,847 --> 00:40:31,494
Speaker 1: You know it's like okay.

676
00:40:31,534 --> 00:40:32,860
Speaker 1: I kind of want to watch bokurano.

677
00:40:32,981 --> 00:40:35,584
Speaker 1: I want to read the books I'm reading more.

678
00:40:35,604 --> 00:40:39,439
Speaker 0: oh the bridge of nothing books that you wouldn't read for so long and now you're finally reading.

684
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,500
Speaker 1: You told me to watch months ago, so you're gonna have to wait months through.

685
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,699
Speaker 0: I do you know instead of reading this and watching that you read things like Marvel team up.

686
00:41:00,201 --> 00:41:01,727
Speaker 1: I read that even way before.

687
00:41:01,747 --> 00:41:03,895
Speaker 0: it's not that good wasn't worth it.

688
00:41:03,996 --> 00:41:05,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was good.

689
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:07,779
Speaker 0: Avatar is much better than Marvel team up.

690
00:41:08,221 --> 00:41:09,183
Speaker 0: Objective scale.

691
00:41:09,284 --> 00:41:10,687
Speaker 1: no no see the thing is.

692
00:41:10,707 --> 00:41:16,710
