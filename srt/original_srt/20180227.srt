1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,442
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, February 27th 2018.

2
00:00:12,442 --> 00:00:12,963
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,224 --> 00:00:15,209
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:18,408
Speaker 1: tonight We're talking about meeple circus.

5
00:00:21,012 --> 00:00:22,028
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:28,453
Speaker 1: So Rangers haven't been doing so well in the old hockey game.

7
00:00:28,673 --> 00:00:28,854
Speaker 0: Nope.

8
00:00:29,055 --> 00:00:30,520
Speaker 1: It's been pretty bad pretty sad.

9
00:00:30,761 --> 00:00:30,981
Speaker 0: I mean.

10
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:33,731
Speaker 0: we have one Stanley Cup in 70 something years.

11
00:00:33,872 --> 00:00:36,100
Speaker 1: Yep, and it's also never been good.

12
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:48,846
Speaker 1: Extra weird because my entire sentient life I have never ever experienced the Stanley Cup where my team wasn't at least in it Because the right wing is my entire life.

13
00:00:49,367 --> 00:00:55,045
Speaker 1: and then the first year the Red Wings were ever not in the playoffs in modern history Rangers were there so it was fine.

14
00:00:55,546 --> 00:01:00,040
Speaker 1: But this year Rangers and Red Wings are basically tied at not in the playoffs.

15
00:01:00,603 --> 00:01:02,956
Speaker 0: We are in the tank roll.

16
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,580
Speaker 0: Thanks roll.

17
00:01:04,322 --> 00:01:17,820
Speaker 1: And it was even funnier because last night was a game between the tied in points Red Wings and Rangers Which is always extra weird because on one hand I I'm primarily a Rangers fan because I've lived in New York for a decade like it's you let the pass go.

18
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,726
Speaker 1: I'm a Rangers fan.

19
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:19,330
Speaker 1: He moved.

20
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:20,640
Speaker 0: he moved to Arizona.

21
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,607
Speaker 0: I probably would.

22
00:01:22,647 --> 00:01:28,508
Speaker 1: eventually the trouble is I instinctively cheer whenever the Red Wings score.

23
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:35,608
Speaker 1: so when the Red Wings won the game in overtime I Cheered while simultaneously booing.

24
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,079
Speaker 1: It's such a cognitive dissonance to see two teams.

25
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:48,140
Speaker 1: I Even if I say I am rooting for the Rangers this core part of me is like yes when the red and white jersey scores.

26
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:54,340
Speaker 1: What makes even worse is that there was a home game in the MSG So the Red Wings were in their away uniform.

27
00:01:54,801 --> 00:02:01,439
Speaker 1: But the Red Wings the away uniforms of today are basically what the home uniforms were a decade ago.

28
00:02:02,681 --> 00:02:08,419
Speaker 1: And for all my childhood hockey, so it was extra weird because it was like that's the home jersey.

29
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,520
Speaker 1: My brain associates with the Rangers and the home jersey my team associates with the Red Wings.

30
00:02:14,022 --> 00:02:17,456
Speaker 1: My brain was just having trouble figuring out what to think during this game as a result.

31
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:23,027
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm but the trade deadline ended today and You sold everybody now.

32
00:02:23,067 --> 00:02:24,654
Speaker 1: They didn't sell everybody everybody.

33
00:02:24,874 --> 00:02:26,140
Speaker 0: Not everyone was buying.

34
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,245
Speaker 0: You can't.

35
00:02:27,286 --> 00:02:30,060
Speaker 0: you can't sell a stock if no one wants to pay what it costs.

36
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:32,307
Speaker 1: Take note Bitcoin people.

37
00:02:32,407 --> 00:02:34,697
Speaker 1: someone has to be willing to pay for your Bitcoin.

38
00:02:34,777 --> 00:02:35,440
Speaker 0: I got a Bitcoin.

39
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:36,948
Speaker 0: I want to sell it for the 20,000.

40
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,080
Speaker 0: It's supposedly worth wine giving you.

41
00:02:41,482 --> 00:02:42,123
Speaker 0: Keep your nothing.

42
00:02:42,144 --> 00:02:51,011
Speaker 0: I'll keep my $20,000 which is basically a car and I giving you a car for nothing Say I guess we'll get right into it.

43
00:02:51,031 --> 00:02:51,939
Speaker 1: You got any gaming news.

44
00:02:53,162 --> 00:02:55,416
Speaker 0: What was my gaming news already forgot?

45
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:56,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, I did art.

46
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:56,943
Speaker 0: Oh, I do remember.

47
00:02:57,404 --> 00:03:00,776
Speaker 0: so the people who made FTL are coming out with this new game.

48
00:03:00,796 --> 00:03:02,080
Speaker 0: That's that's all the rage.

49
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,931
Speaker 0: It comes out like what tomorrow or something real?

50
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:09,165
Speaker 0: Yeah today Ridiculously soon right?

51
00:03:09,185 --> 00:03:13,600
Speaker 0: this game has been hyped up for a countdown on Steam until it unlocks if you pre-order it as a class.

52
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:17,312
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, so this game is called into the breach.

53
00:03:17,472 --> 00:03:20,624
Speaker 0: I think yep, and if it's made by the FTL people So it's a rogue.

54
00:03:20,644 --> 00:03:26,349
Speaker 0: you like the rogue like like we like And it's probably high quality because they seemed.

55
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:31,214
Speaker 0: it is a very good and it is a grid turn-based strategy game involving mechs.

56
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:39,901
Speaker 0: So imagine FTL except when you go to the next place instead of having like this spaceship battle thing going on you.

57
00:03:39,961 --> 00:03:49,388
Speaker 0: instead you do a little tiny advance wars involving mechs and Then you do another one and basically when your people die They're like sort of like Fire Emblem.

58
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:58,700
Speaker 0: and when you got one when you got one guy left You can you basically run away and start the game over with that one guy and that one guy can keep leveling up even if You keep failing.

59
00:03:58,861 --> 00:04:00,511
Speaker 1: I always wanted an advance.

60
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:02,020
Speaker 1: wars like game where?

61
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:09,619
Speaker 0: Victory and defeat weren't just this but of course that one guy that like you've taken on like let's say you go through and you Fail, but you save this one, dude.

62
00:04:09,981 --> 00:04:14,180
Speaker 0: Then you keep you try again, and you fail, but you save the same dude because he's the most leveled up guy.

63
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,246
Speaker 0: That's you're gonna save right.

64
00:04:15,487 --> 00:04:17,619
Speaker 0: you go through a third time, and you save that dude again.

65
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,959
Speaker 0: now He's way powerful and on the fourth go through that guy dies.

66
00:04:21,741 --> 00:04:24,500
Speaker 1: Apparently there is a ton of stuff in the game.

67
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:33,238
Speaker 1: There's a quote here in this polygon article after just an hour in the game I'd already unlocked much more new content than in a dozen hours of the previous game FTL.

68
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:33,600
Speaker 0: right now.

69
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:38,280
Speaker 1: That's not to say it was any easier simply more generous and encouraging of experimentation.

70
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,106
Speaker 1: I also I will say I like FTL.

71
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,353
Speaker 1: it does not encourage experimentation.

72
00:04:42,433 --> 00:04:46,126
Speaker 1: I am terrified of almost every decision I make in that game, so this is a game.

73
00:04:46,146 --> 00:04:47,311
Speaker 0: That's coming out soon.

74
00:04:47,331 --> 00:04:53,654
Speaker 0: I want to talk briefly about this other game That's the hotness these days called slay the spire, which I had been playing even though.

75
00:04:53,674 --> 00:04:55,500
Speaker 0: It's just early access beta mode.

76
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,344
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I got to play that.

77
00:04:56,485 --> 00:04:58,937
Speaker 0: so this game slay the spire is an early access.

78
00:04:58,997 --> 00:05:07,394
Speaker 0: right now it is made by some people in the netrunner community and Basically, it's also a roguelike, but it's a roguelike deck building game.

79
00:05:07,434 --> 00:05:11,875
Speaker 0: both of these are single-player PC games by the way And the way it works is like you know dominion.

80
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:16,640
Speaker 0: you draw a hand of cards You play as many as you can you throw out the rest you draw a new hand of cards, right?

81
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:23,171
Speaker 0: So what this is is like a little Final Fantasy battle And you get a hand of cards and you play them, and you're just.

82
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:24,557
Speaker 0: you're the only one playing cards.

83
00:05:24,637 --> 00:05:27,981
Speaker 0: the bad guys Actually tell you exactly what the fuck they're gonna Do.

84
00:05:28,021 --> 00:05:33,765
Speaker 0: it's like oh I can see that that guy is going to attack for 15 and that guy's gonna do some sort of Defensive move.

85
00:05:33,806 --> 00:05:42,879
Speaker 0: this turn and you play your you have three mana And you play your player cards And then you throw out whatever you don't play and draw a new hand and then the things happen.

86
00:05:43,665 --> 00:05:58,560
Speaker 0: And then you play cards again And as you continue through the game you remove cards from your deck adds add cards to your deck get relics They give you special abilities And you go on to the next battle in the next battle in the next battle and getting all sorts of stuff going on.

87
00:05:58,721 --> 00:06:02,099
Speaker 0: Shopping for different you know potions and stuff go alright.

88
00:06:02,622 --> 00:06:09,048
Speaker 0: This is also a way fun roguelike is basically playing dominion against the computer Also a roguelike.

89
00:06:09,088 --> 00:06:11,560
Speaker 0: this game is way hot even though it's early access.

90
00:06:11,761 --> 00:06:17,120
Speaker 0: It is already hot and it is way successful like there's a zillion streamers on Twitch for this game.

91
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:18,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, even though it's early access.

92
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:22,548
Speaker 0: so right now It is a single-player strategy.

93
00:06:22,588 --> 00:06:28,797
Speaker 0: roguelike PC gaming time and those are the two games That you got play slay the spire and into the breach.

94
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:34,500
Speaker 1: yep I'm feeling this into the bridge even though cuz you know fire emblem has that mobile game that has like the mini grid battles.

95
00:06:34,581 --> 00:06:35,105
Speaker 0: I've never.

96
00:06:35,206 --> 00:06:38,426
Speaker 0: that is a garbage pain Microchess game.

97
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:39,129
Speaker 0: that is not a.

98
00:06:39,371 --> 00:06:51,431
Speaker 1: I have never been a fan previously of the small grid style of advanced wars like games because they tended to Never involve even the remotest of interesting strategy.

99
00:06:51,692 --> 00:06:54,039
Speaker 0: I still I still gonna bet you will enjoy this game.

100
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,810
Speaker 1: I Feel pretty confident this game's gonna break that trend for me.

101
00:06:58,232 --> 00:06:59,636
Speaker 1: Just looking at these screen shot.

102
00:06:59,656 --> 00:07:01,578
Speaker 0: You like the gym fire though That was small grids.

103
00:07:02,682 --> 00:07:18,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, but so the gym fire the small grid was more about food management for the Army's verse and as opposed to it Fantasy empires was more about the like desertion rate of your troops based on their morale.

104
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,420
Speaker 0: I mean that isn't that just a different abstraction of the same food concept?

105
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:23,364
Speaker 1: No, the food was.

106
00:07:23,605 --> 00:07:26,076
Speaker 1: you'll have food like the army when you attack someone you choose.

107
00:07:26,116 --> 00:07:34,544
Speaker 1: It's one of those old like Koay games that was like here's how many troops I'm bringing and here's how much food I'm bringing with me.

108
00:07:34,564 --> 00:07:38,760
Speaker 1: and then the bigger your army was the more food it burned through per day.

109
00:07:39,182 --> 00:07:42,080
Speaker 1: And you might run out of food before you broke the siege and all that kind of nonsense.

110
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:43,967
Speaker 1: Nobody likes Jim fire, but me.

111
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:45,011
Speaker 1: that's there.

112
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:47,199
Speaker 1: That's the end result there, but I'm feeling this game.

113
00:07:48,361 --> 00:07:51,419
Speaker 1: So in some other news if you didn't notice I play a lot of overwatch.

114
00:07:52,303 --> 00:08:05,926
Speaker 1: it's kind of my main game now and One of the things that I always lamented was that overwatch didn't really include a capture the flag mode Even though capture the flag the number one mode in a character class-based FPS see competitive you say that.

115
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:10,920
Speaker 1: but actually capture the flag was the number one mode in an era that predates most gamers.

116
00:08:11,668 --> 00:08:18,080
Speaker 0: Yes, but for me That's the number one mode that you played in Tia anything with a TF in the title and anything with the tribes in the title.

117
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:21,030
Speaker 0: Capture the flag was the default number one mode.

118
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,836
Speaker 0: all the other modes were secondary modes.

119
00:08:22,976 --> 00:08:32,900
Speaker 1: yep, so Overwatch did introduce a capture the flag mode But it was just in the arcade team fortress 2 and it was broken and it was crappy and it wasn't really well thought out.

120
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,488
Speaker 0: They wasn't that the first mode they made.

121
00:08:35,508 --> 00:08:36,953
Speaker 1: yeah, so they made there.

122
00:08:37,094 --> 00:08:39,462
Speaker 0: I wasn't that the primary game mode There's.

123
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:43,953
Speaker 1: I don't actually really know why they didn't make the game CTF first other than that.

124
00:08:44,515 --> 00:08:49,455
Speaker 1: I don't think CTF has Really any cache a with most modern gamers.

125
00:08:49,475 --> 00:08:50,480
Speaker 1: It's just us old-timers.

126
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,520
Speaker 1: But the existing modes with the payload push in the zone capture and all that they're fine.

127
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,840
Speaker 1: But capture the flag I think has a lot more potential for good spectator experiences.

128
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,561
Speaker 0: Yeah I was.

129
00:09:01,762 --> 00:09:08,828
Speaker 0: I always thought that CTF was the default mode because you carry into it your Childhood experience of playing literal capture the flag.

130
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:11,156
Speaker 1: most kids don't play capture the flag and how.

131
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:12,340
Speaker 0: that is the greatest thing.

132
00:09:12,641 --> 00:09:17,039
Speaker 0: And now the fact that you know, of course, that's what you would want to do in the video game land, right?

133
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:20,190
Speaker 1: A lot of kids don't play capture the flag.

134
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:20,872
Speaker 0: Well, that's a crime.

135
00:09:20,912 --> 00:09:22,498
Speaker 0: We should start competitive real-world.

136
00:09:22,538 --> 00:09:24,899
Speaker 1: capture the flag Yeah, but with guns like paintball.

137
00:09:26,081 --> 00:09:27,006
Speaker 0: How about with just nothing?

138
00:09:27,448 --> 00:09:28,493
Speaker 0: just capturing flags?

139
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,619
Speaker 0: Yeah and jail.

140
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,674
Speaker 1: and When we played it we bet the rules for catching someone.

141
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,438
Speaker 1: it wasn't the rules.

142
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,968
Speaker 0: We changed the rules so many fucking times.

143
00:09:37,349 --> 00:09:43,191
Speaker 1: We used touch football flags like flag football and You basically had to grab a guy's flag and then he was out.

144
00:09:43,212 --> 00:09:44,680
Speaker 0: We're doing an episode and capture the flag.

145
00:09:45,621 --> 00:09:48,733
Speaker 0: That is that I'm writing that down cuz I was gonna tell a story of.

146
00:09:48,773 --> 00:09:50,420
Speaker 0: I'm gonna save it right down.

147
00:09:50,621 --> 00:09:59,635
Speaker 1: I write it down right now tonight's episode and capture the flag coming soon Because if we don't write it down right now, it will literally never happen.

148
00:09:59,756 --> 00:10:04,942
Speaker 1: someone remind us In fact, it will curse us if we if I say if we say oh, we'll remember to do this We won't.

149
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,416
Speaker 1: it guarantees that we will die before we make that episode.

150
00:10:07,437 --> 00:10:07,859
Speaker 0: That's right.

151
00:10:08,715 --> 00:10:17,325
Speaker 1: So Blizzard did what they do in that whenever there's a mode that they introduced like Lucio ball or something and then everyone says oh this Mode is broken.

152
00:10:17,385 --> 00:10:18,152
Speaker 1: This sucks or whatever.

153
00:10:18,273 --> 00:10:19,019
Speaker 1: We don't care about it.

154
00:10:19,941 --> 00:10:22,489
Speaker 1: They pay attention and they just quietly fix it.

155
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:31,000
Speaker 1: So they re-released capture the flag and they fixed Almost all the problems the previous initial iteration of capture the flag problems?

156
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:33,580
Speaker 1: Does it still have the problems that it still has?

157
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,360
Speaker 1: So are so let's see right now the things they change is probably more interesting.

158
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,278
Speaker 1: So now first team to capture three times wins in the time of the match.

159
00:10:42,378 --> 00:10:42,880
Speaker 0: That sounds good.

160
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:48,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, if it is tied at the end of that time, so two flags each say yep Then it goes on to death.

161
00:10:48,851 --> 00:10:49,900
Speaker 0: next flag wins God.

162
00:10:50,047 --> 00:10:51,705
Speaker 1: No So the game restarts.

163
00:10:51,745 --> 00:10:59,259
Speaker 1: you re-pick your heroes and it moves the two flags and the capture points To be basically right fucking next to each other in the middle of the map.

164
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,275
Speaker 1: Okay, and just go go go.

165
00:11:02,961 --> 00:11:05,211
Speaker 1: It just ends almost immediately after.

166
00:11:05,251 --> 00:11:07,380
Speaker 0: oh because the flag and the capture point are adjacent.

167
00:11:07,682 --> 00:11:09,879
Speaker 0: Yes, you have to take the flag and just move it like an inch.

168
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,859
Speaker 1: They're like they'll be like a pillar and they're basically like 40 feet apart on either side of a pillar.

169
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,594
Speaker 0: So you have to rush to the middle grab the flag and slam dunk it.

170
00:11:18,634 --> 00:11:20,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't move the spawn points.

171
00:11:20,101 --> 00:11:21,659
Speaker 1: The spawn points are still way back, right?

172
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,440
Speaker 0: See basically everyone rushes to the middle to try to grab their flag and slam dunk it in the net.

173
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,560
Speaker 0: That's right next to the flag?

174
00:11:26,688 --> 00:11:30,031
Speaker 0: Yep But also because I bring it all the way back to your spawn like usual.

175
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:39,560
Speaker 1: but also it means that killing even one person on The other team it's probably already game over because even if they get time to respawn they got to run all the way back.

176
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:44,000
Speaker 0: Are there any sort of like characters that can like sort of control the area and push the enemies back?

177
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,399
Speaker 0: So long enough for the fast person to move the flag?

178
00:11:46,862 --> 00:11:49,873
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, there are and that's part of the strategy of those eggs.

179
00:11:49,934 --> 00:11:51,460
Speaker 1: those options exist for both sides.

180
00:11:51,681 --> 00:11:52,889
Speaker 0: Okay, what do you do about him?

181
00:11:53,191 --> 00:11:54,460
Speaker 0: be faster rush in the middle?

182
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:00,480
Speaker 1: They also dealt with the problem where characters have movement powers like some characters can fly or teleport or whatever.

183
00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:05,136
Speaker 1: so the rule they implemented was anyone can grab the flag and passive powers work.

184
00:12:05,176 --> 00:12:09,538
Speaker 1: fine, but Special movement powers cause you to drop the flag.

185
00:12:09,638 --> 00:12:19,486
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Yeah Which on one end I disagree with because in the old weapons factory days and like mega TF the super fast recon type flying characters They could just fly with the flag.

186
00:12:19,526 --> 00:12:21,152
Speaker 0: I mean you have Scout and TF - it's.

187
00:12:21,413 --> 00:12:22,919
Speaker 1: and they just rip and right back out.

188
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:33,759
Speaker 1: But I do see how that really violates the sensibilities of modern gamers and I can swallow my bile Because it is actually pretty good the way they've implemented it.

189
00:12:34,322 --> 00:12:37,259
Speaker 0: I think the way you want to do it is just the way tribes to did it where it's like.

190
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,147
Speaker 0: yeah You got jetpack.

191
00:12:38,248 --> 00:12:38,974
Speaker 0: So does everybody?

192
00:12:39,297 --> 00:12:45,360
Speaker 0: Yeah It's fine for you to jetpack with that flag and get into a strike because guess what here comes some more strikes.

193
00:12:45,701 --> 00:12:47,686
Speaker 1: But blizzard escalated real quick.

194
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:50,233
Speaker 1: They didn't just fix most of the problems with CTF.

195
00:12:50,554 --> 00:12:52,500
Speaker 1: They made it a ranked competitive mode.

196
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:54,878
Speaker 1: yeah, so now there's the only mode worth playing.

197
00:12:54,899 --> 00:13:04,795
Speaker 1: and the only thing I have to say is that I've been solo Rando queuing the competitive capture the flag and I know for a fact I know capture the flag like I know my own blood.

198
00:13:04,815 --> 00:13:05,377
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

199
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:14,280
Speaker 1: Problem is as far as I can tell 100% of the other human beings playing this capture the flag mode are in fact dogs chewing on controllers.

200
00:13:15,382 --> 00:13:18,219
Speaker 1: Good God can people can people younger than us?

201
00:13:18,934 --> 00:13:24,820
Speaker 0: Not You then be quickly ranking out of the dog with controller would rank and getting to a higher tier.

202
00:13:25,163 --> 00:13:34,880
Speaker 1: So in a capture the flag mode One person even with the you know, like the they've let the movement powers worked out or at everything Cannot on their own swing the game.

203
00:13:36,181 --> 00:13:41,860
Speaker 0: So it's another crappy ranking mode that based only on wins and losses and not based on individual performance based on teams.

204
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:51,504
Speaker 1: The thing is remember everything in overwatch the ranked systems Almost every complaint anyone has is around the fact that the game is designed from its very core To be a game.

205
00:13:51,544 --> 00:13:52,869
Speaker 1: or you have a team of six.

206
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:59,480
Speaker 1: as soon as you are saying put me on a team with other people You're already violating a fundamental contract of the game.

207
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,373
Speaker 0: Does it separate your rankings for solo play from your rankings?

208
00:14:02,413 --> 00:14:03,960
Speaker 0: for I have a prepared team play?

209
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,260
Speaker 0: Uh, no, but match make but rocket League gets that right?

210
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,960
Speaker 0: You have a separate rank in every different mode in rocket League.

211
00:14:11,442 --> 00:14:15,340
Speaker 0: So if you prepare teams you get ranked separately from your solo, right?

212
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:27,040
Speaker 1: So instead what the matchmaking does is it will whenever possible if you come in with a four stack or a six stack Put you against another group of equivalent size with the same number of randos.

213
00:14:28,942 --> 00:14:32,020
Speaker 1: So if I make a team of five, I'll go up against another team of five.

214
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:38,977
Speaker 1: We both get the Russian roulette of the Hanzo that's gonna join not join the team chat and proceed to sit in the corner crying Mm-hmm.

215
00:14:40,401 --> 00:14:46,737
Speaker 1: So, yeah, this is pretty interesting how it's shaken down and I hope they've already talked about more changes They're gonna make to CTF.

216
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:54,389
Speaker 1: They're really they're pushing CTF way harder than I expected which is real interesting because this is the mode I actually care about a lot.

217
00:14:54,671 --> 00:14:55,214
Speaker 0: That's the mood.

218
00:14:55,274 --> 00:14:56,140
Speaker 0: I care about a lot, too.

219
00:14:56,441 --> 00:15:00,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, if it I will I will tell you if it gets good enough to where it's worth you playing it.

220
00:15:01,182 --> 00:15:01,947
Speaker 1: It's not there yet.

221
00:15:02,008 --> 00:15:02,692
Speaker 1: It's not.

222
00:15:02,793 --> 00:15:03,940
Speaker 0: it still cost too much money.

223
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,308
Speaker 1: What do you care?

224
00:15:05,328 --> 00:15:05,791
Speaker 1: You got money?

225
00:15:05,811 --> 00:15:07,160
Speaker 0: I mean by furniture.

226
00:15:08,202 --> 00:15:13,337
Speaker 0: Actually, I too need to buy Someone on Twitter was like hey, New York City friends.

227
00:15:13,397 --> 00:15:15,186
Speaker 0: I'm coming to New York Can I get a couch?

228
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,379
Speaker 0: and I was like my couch literally has a giant hole in it.

229
00:15:17,721 --> 00:15:24,320
Speaker 1: We were at a friend's house someone else playing a game night the other night over the weekend and they had just bought a new couch.

230
00:15:24,561 --> 00:15:35,170
Speaker 1: I was grilling him about that patch but anyway things of the day we got.

231
00:15:36,551 --> 00:15:40,266
Speaker 0: So I'm pretty sure everyone's seen this on the internet already, but it's so good.

232
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,210
Speaker 0: It's got me thinking today.

233
00:15:42,452 --> 00:15:44,078
Speaker 0: I saw the link earlier, but I washed it.

234
00:15:44,099 --> 00:15:44,962
Speaker 0: poor rim got here.

235
00:15:45,263 --> 00:15:46,910
Speaker 0: So there's a game that's old by now.

236
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:50,521
Speaker 0: I actually called papers, please if you haven't played papers papers game.

237
00:15:50,561 --> 00:15:51,003
Speaker 1: just play it.

238
00:15:51,163 --> 00:15:53,330
Speaker 0: It is a way good single-player PC game.

239
00:15:53,431 --> 00:15:54,738
Speaker 0: I think it might be on other platforms.

240
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:58,336
Speaker 0: I don't even know but PC is best Master race.

241
00:15:58,356 --> 00:16:03,013
Speaker 0: so go on your PC and play papers, please if you haven't already But I'm pretty sure you have.

242
00:16:03,455 --> 00:16:17,022
Speaker 0: it is a game where you are in a fictional but obviously Eastern European East Germany country where there is a you know, very You know big brother government and you are at.

243
00:16:17,403 --> 00:16:28,404
Speaker 0: you're in charge of inspecting people's passports and such trying to come into the country at the border and you have instructions and you're Inspecting to make sure documents are legit and you let people in or turn them away.

244
00:16:28,424 --> 00:16:30,629
Speaker 1: the games like the the give you a sense of this game.

245
00:16:30,851 --> 00:16:32,797
Speaker 1: Literally you in the game will.

246
00:16:32,978 --> 00:16:34,322
Speaker 1: someone will hand you their passport.

247
00:16:34,363 --> 00:16:36,490
Speaker 1: you look at it and flip it over like look through the stuff.

248
00:16:36,972 --> 00:16:41,859
Speaker 1: Then if you're not sure you pull out this giant book in game Put it on the table.

249
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:48,390
Speaker 1: that covers your whole stupid table Like it's in the way and a problem and you're flipping through it trying to figure out what to do based on the rules.

250
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,317
Speaker 0: Anyway, so it's a great game.

251
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,230
Speaker 0: And for some reason even though the game is way old.

252
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:58,030
Speaker 0: There is now an official short film of the game.

253
00:16:58,211 --> 00:17:07,384
Speaker 0: So if you whether if you've played the game You will appreciate this short film very very much And if you haven't this short film will convince you to go back and play it.

254
00:17:08,006 --> 00:17:12,987
Speaker 1: the games real good And also it's it's more real and disturbing than you might expect.

255
00:17:13,007 --> 00:17:13,489
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

256
00:17:14,193 --> 00:17:16,163
Speaker 1: And if you haven't played you just got to play this game.

257
00:17:16,183 --> 00:17:31,722
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, so Apparently if you skate as an ice skate on really thin ice thin like like an inch I mean that's thin but it's not Super thin like.

258
00:17:31,742 --> 00:17:39,820
Speaker 0: when I think of thin ice I think like, you know that little tiny sliver of ice that forms that rhyme of ice Like jump across.

259
00:17:39,861 --> 00:17:42,895
Speaker 1: as a kid in the elementary school playground I think you crash through it

260
00:17:43,076 --> 00:17:50,730
Speaker 0: like there's a puddle and it's a really cold day and there's just like this little tiny sheet of Ice floating on it and if you poke it crackles, you know, it's like it's like cornflake thick.

261
00:17:51,356 --> 00:17:52,409
Speaker 0: So that's thin ice.

262
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:57,988
Speaker 1: Apparently there is this sport in I guess Norway called Nordic skating or anything.

263
00:17:58,148 --> 00:18:09,987
Speaker 1: any sport Involving cold and snow is in Norway or wild ice skating and basically they just ice skate on Super thin ice through the wilderness like down rivers, isn't this?

264
00:18:10,067 --> 00:18:13,776
Speaker 0: I mean an inch isn't Ridiculously dangerous, but it's still dangerous.

265
00:18:13,816 --> 00:18:15,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, what if you fall in?

266
00:18:15,441 --> 00:18:17,407
Speaker 1: so if no one's there you're dead.

267
00:18:17,427 --> 00:18:19,798
Speaker 0: Oh, okay I'm just checking that.

268
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:32,376
Speaker 1: but the cool the cool things about this are one don't Actually explains in pretty good detail like What the deal with this is and like why it works and why he doesn't just fall through and why if you tried to do It you probably would fall through.

269
00:18:32,396 --> 00:18:35,070
Speaker 0: maybe he's super light and maybe he's doing it in a certain way.

270
00:18:35,853 --> 00:18:41,010
Speaker 0: There's a lot of science distributing his weight across more ice and not pushing it into a single spot in the ice.

271
00:18:41,331 --> 00:18:43,200
Speaker 1: Also, just the way ice forms.

272
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:43,421
Speaker 0: Yes.

273
00:18:43,482 --> 00:18:44,065
Speaker 0: I'm just guessing.

274
00:18:44,105 --> 00:18:47,856
Speaker 1: Yeah, what kinds of Pressures are being exerted?

275
00:18:48,197 --> 00:18:50,103
Speaker 1: like it's risk kind of complicated actually.

276
00:18:50,344 --> 00:19:00,440
Speaker 1: Oh, in fact the video just said it's complicated Mm-hmm, but the craziest thing about it is the sounds that Thin ice make when you skate on it.

277
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:05,970
Speaker 0: This is this video is really cool just for that Because usually when you skate in an ice rink, there's nothing under the ice.

278
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,950
Speaker 0: It's a floor and we skate on thick ice like three four or five inches.

279
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:09,572
Speaker 0: It's just ice.

280
00:19:09,652 --> 00:19:16,480
Speaker 0: the sat the vibrations in the set the the view and the sound waves from you skating don't really go into the Water or come out of the water.

281
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,830
Speaker 0: very much, right?

282
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:25,468
Speaker 0: but if it's thin ice like an inch then the sounds can go in the water and come back and sort of echo against the Bottom of the ice and they sound cool.

283
00:19:25,883 --> 00:19:34,482
Speaker 1: Yep And I use this as my thing of the day instead of the kid pissing on the elevator because while that is a plus We're still not sure how if that's a fake video or not.

284
00:19:34,502 --> 00:19:40,588
Speaker 0: I am more than 50% convinced It's fake, but if you didn't see elevator piss boy, you got to see it even though it's fake.

285
00:19:40,608 --> 00:19:41,030
Speaker 0: It's still worth.

288
00:19:44,604 --> 00:19:47,780
Speaker 0: go into it a mat, you know Thinking it's probably fake.

00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:23,790
Speaker 0: It's like an hour and a half faster, okay, but it's like 10 bucks to ride a bull bus.

301
00:20:23,971 --> 00:20:25,437
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like even with a discount.

302

309
00:20:41,396 --> 00:20:44,690
Speaker 1: I got the rewards program with Amtrak and I got a lot of free Amtrak's coming my way.

310
00:20:45,093 --> 00:20:45,920
Speaker 0: It's not rewards.

311
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,170
Speaker 0: you paid for those when you paid.

312
00:20:49,395 --> 00:20:55,770
Speaker 1: But we will be there on Sunday doing the like full final for real version of our top 40 tabletop games.

313
00:20:56,895 --> 00:20:59,170
Speaker 0: Right, it's only sounds like a clickbait panel, right?

314
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,730
Speaker 0: Cuz it's like oh we're gonna go listing top 40 games.

315
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:09,956
Speaker 0: But actually what we're doing is it's we're just gonna use that as an excuse to talk about 40 different gaming Concepts that are worth knowing.

316
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:13,288
Speaker 0: and it's just those games just examples of those kinds to give you an idea.

317
00:21:13,851 --> 00:21:15,198
Speaker 1: The way not a ranking thing.

318
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:17,230
Speaker 1: the way we write this panel is for every game.

319
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:31,711
Speaker 1: Oh a game only makes this list if there are two Noteworthy interesting things about the game's mechanics and it can't be the same thing as any other game on the list And it's a lot of games that we don't actually like at all Mm-hmm.

320
00:21:32,574 --> 00:21:33,436
Speaker 1: So yeah, that'll be fun.

321
00:21:33,456 --> 00:21:40,837
Speaker 1: And otherwise PAX East is for goddamn days and it looks like Thursdays and Sundays aren't even sold out yet.

322
00:21:41,118 --> 00:21:44,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can go to PAX East Thursday or Sunday for like 50 bucks.

323
00:21:44,992 --> 00:21:46,259
Speaker 1: Yeah, that ain't bad.

324
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,130
Speaker 0: I mean on Sunday you're getting a short day.

325
00:21:48,231 --> 00:21:48,555
Speaker 0: So it's not.

326
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:49,669
Speaker 0: you're sort of getting ripped off.

327
00:21:52,592 --> 00:21:57,030
Speaker 0: And if you and you're gonna get a less crowded expo and if you go on Thursday, it's gonna be way not crowded.

328
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,115
Speaker 1: Yeah, keynote Q&A.

329
00:21:58,155 --> 00:21:59,682
Speaker 0: He's one day off work.

330
00:21:59,742 --> 00:22:05,650
Speaker 0: If you live in the area go on Thursday It'll be way less crowded to get the keynote and the Q&A and everything and you get a full PAX day.

331
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,674
Speaker 0: You can stay till midnight.

332
00:22:06,815 --> 00:22:07,718
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know.

333
00:22:07,758 --> 00:22:10,590
Speaker 0: and then I guess it's gonna be pre pax tabletop gaming on Wednesday.

334
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:11,929
Speaker 0: Will there be when?

335
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:13,941
Speaker 0: Wednesday night?

336
00:22:14,022 --> 00:22:18,610
Speaker 1: damn The problem is this is why we don't go to a lot of other conventions anymore.

337
00:22:18,751 --> 00:22:21,262
Speaker 1: All the paxes are like just broadening into.

338
00:22:21,302 --> 00:22:22,910
Speaker 1: eventually our lives will just be packs.

339
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:28,875
Speaker 1: Lisa I'm going where the pool goes Otherwise in about a moment.

340
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:31,790
Speaker 1: the book club book was the fifth season by NK jemisin.

341
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,979
Speaker 1: It was fantastic the current book club book, which I'm gonna update because I started reading it.

342
00:22:34,999 --> 00:22:41,457
Speaker 1: Finally is Emily Wilson's translation new translation of The Odyssey by Homer.

343
00:22:41,658 --> 00:22:44,506
Speaker 0: I haven't gotten much farther in that but I did reread it.

344
00:22:44,826 --> 00:22:46,090
Speaker 0: pop-up book of the Odyssey.

345
00:22:46,453 --> 00:22:48,530
Speaker 0: Oh, it's completion because it didn't take very long.

346
00:22:48,811 --> 00:22:56,114
Speaker 1: So the intro is fantastic, but now I've actually burned quite a bit of a ways through the actual Odyssey itself This translation.

347
00:22:56,174 --> 00:23:00,027
Speaker 1: I went back and read the first like the beginning of the Odyssey in the old translation.

348
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:00,830
Speaker 1: I read from high school.

349
00:23:01,872 --> 00:23:04,559
Speaker 1: It feels way different to read it.

350
00:23:04,579 --> 00:23:14,410
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm If you've never read the Odyssey it It's just very plain and feels very like.

351
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:18,432
Speaker 1: Alright, if he's doing this thing and this jerks up to no good It's just.

352
00:23:18,914 --> 00:23:25,999
Speaker 1: there's something about it that I really like and I don't want to really spoil all that till we do the book club Show, but if you've never read the Odyssey read this translation.

353
00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:26,601
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

354
00:23:27,102 --> 00:23:29,510
Speaker 1: And if you have read the Odyssey read this translation.

355
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,373
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's the book club.

356
00:23:30,674 --> 00:23:30,795
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

357
00:23:31,517 --> 00:23:33,384
Speaker 1: And if you're not reading our book club books, I don't know.

358
00:23:33,404 --> 00:23:36,422
Speaker 1: read a book read a book Any any of them.

359
00:23:36,564 --> 00:23:36,928
Speaker 1: any book?

360
00:23:37,913 --> 00:23:41,024
Speaker 0: Read not no no audiobook unless you're blind.

361
00:23:41,064 --> 00:23:42,890
Speaker 1: That's okay, then not a sports page.

362
00:23:46,752 --> 00:23:55,409
Speaker 1: So this is a game people circus that I Heard I don't know when I first heard about it cuz it's pretty new like it's weird.

363
00:23:55,670 --> 00:24:01,305
Speaker 0: It feels like the term meeple circus like is just like the first time I heard it.

364
00:24:01,365 --> 00:24:02,227
Speaker 0: It didn't feel new.

365
00:24:02,247 --> 00:24:05,289
Speaker 0: it felt like There's always been a meeple circus.

366
00:24:05,551 --> 00:24:14,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, the meeple circus of every tabletop game ever because pretty much anyone who plays tabletop games What do you do when you're bored because Joey Jojo takes forever on his fucking turn?

367
00:24:14,711 --> 00:24:17,990
Speaker 0: It's like whenever it's your turn when it's not your turn in a tabletop game.

368
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,950
Speaker 0: You're sitting there and in front of you you're playing settlers.

369
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:24,170
Speaker 0: You got a bunch of little houses or meeples and you play with them.

370
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,430
Speaker 0: That's just what you naturally do a meeple circus.

371
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27,915
Speaker 0: The actual game does.

372
00:24:27,935 --> 00:24:32,550
Speaker 1: if you've ever played settlers, you know exactly how high you can stack all your pieces, right?

373
00:24:32,691 --> 00:24:37,590
Speaker 0: It is a game in which you stack wooden board game pieces competitively.

374
00:24:37,992 --> 00:24:39,700
Speaker 0: Now there are the official game.

375
00:24:39,761 --> 00:24:41,248
Speaker 0: It's not like a thing you do while you're bored.

376
00:24:41,268 --> 00:24:46,344
Speaker 1: now There are a lot of tabletop games like via Paletti or Jenga or Rhino hero.

377
00:24:46,745 --> 00:24:49,274
Speaker 1: that involves some sort of stacking Component.

378
00:24:49,495 --> 00:24:52,890
Speaker 0: there are lots of construction games and destruction games.

379
00:24:53,010 --> 00:25:00,476
Speaker 0: We've reviewed many of them on geek night and a lot of them have similar problems the one problem being well one person knocks it Everyone else win.

380
00:25:00,516 --> 00:25:01,419
Speaker 0: that's kind of lame.

381
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:09,830
Speaker 1: or one person knocks it down via Paletti And now we have a really hand-fisted and kind of crappy scoring mechanism to determine who won.

382
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:12,529
Speaker 1: Yeah, that really removes the skill component.

383
00:25:13,414 --> 00:25:27,549
Speaker 1: So meeple circus is one of the rare stacking pieces games that has a pretty legit win condition and is about your skill of stacking and Doesn't seem to have a very low skill cap.

384
00:25:28,211 --> 00:25:35,718
Speaker 1: Because many of the games that try to solve this problem end up having such a low skill cap that over the course of a Pax everyone in our group is playing perfectly in.

385
00:25:35,738 --> 00:25:36,400
Speaker 1: the game is boring.

386
00:25:37,243 --> 00:25:38,990
Speaker 0: So pretty much how it works is the app.

387
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,241
Speaker 0: It's an app controlled game, but the app does not actually do much.

388
00:25:42,261 --> 00:25:43,565
Speaker 0: The app is mostly a timer.

389
00:25:43,586 --> 00:25:44,850
Speaker 1: It just plays a song.

390
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:47,329
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a timer with a circus song.

391
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:54,810
Speaker 0: So the circus has three acts right and in the first act you got a pretty simple circus.

392
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:58,075
Speaker 0: you don't have a lot of pieces to work with and You know, you build.

393
00:25:58,196 --> 00:25:59,907
Speaker 0: everyone is simultaneously making.

394
00:25:59,927 --> 00:26:09,970
Speaker 0: you know It says like it's like the timer starts and everyone has to build their circus and you're trying to arrange the meeples in Such a way according to the rules that they are worth the most points for you.

395
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:20,364
Speaker 0: For example, there might be bonus points for putting a purple guy on top or something Right, like you get you if you get a red guy But you have a measuring stick for how high is your red guy on the ground?

396
00:26:20,405 --> 00:26:22,654
Speaker 1: and some guys can't be on the ground They don't get points.

397
00:26:22,675 --> 00:26:25,110
Speaker 1: some guys can't be under another guy.

398
00:26:25,331 --> 00:26:27,341
Speaker 1: Yeah, some guys are just animals.

399
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:28,930
Speaker 0: each meeple has different rules.

400
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:34,807
Speaker 0: There's camels and elephants and sticks and balls and barrels and all sorts of like.

401
00:26:34,828 --> 00:26:35,510
Speaker 1: the strong man.

402
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:36,895
Speaker 0: There's a strong man.

403
00:26:36,935 --> 00:26:38,742
Speaker 0: There's a. there's this generic acrobats.

404
00:26:38,762 --> 00:26:39,926
Speaker 0: There's all kinds of different meeples.

405
00:26:39,946 --> 00:26:40,950
Speaker 0: They all do different things.

406
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:42,569
Speaker 0: You want to stack them in different ways?

407
00:26:43,554 --> 00:26:44,806
Speaker 0: And then you go after.

408
00:26:44,826 --> 00:26:46,139
Speaker 0: you do that Everyone gets points.

409
00:26:46,482 --> 00:26:48,716
Speaker 0: you do round two Which is pretty similar to round one.

410
00:26:48,776 --> 00:26:52,452
Speaker 0: only now everyone has even more meeples and it gets a little crazy Because

411
00:26:52,472 --> 00:27:04,668
Speaker 1: you're doing this draft mechanic where you know What's likely to like what the scoring things are like what will be scored and then you're sort of drafting to collect pieces Like I'll take this card that gives me two of the blue guys and an elephant.

412
00:27:04,788 --> 00:27:07,195
Speaker 0: Yep So you do round two?

413
00:27:07,275 --> 00:27:11,230
Speaker 0: It's the second act of the circus and then the third act of the circus.

414
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:14,746
Speaker 0: This is where shit gets crazy right and the third act of the circus.

415
00:27:14,927 --> 00:27:18,410
Speaker 0: everyone goes Individually one at a time not simultaneously.

416
00:27:19,773 --> 00:27:26,490
Speaker 0: and while you're doing this Not only do you have to construct something according to the same rules and get the most points?

417
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:33,050
Speaker 0: Not only do you have even more meeples than before but you have to do some sort of performance aspect, right?

418
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:35,037
Speaker 0: For example, what was one of them?

419
00:27:35,057 --> 00:27:38,750
Speaker 0: We say like hop every time you place a certain thing or something.

420
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:42,342
Speaker 1: Yeah, so basically in the first two rounds everyone builds their thing simultaneously.

421
00:27:42,663 --> 00:27:45,937
Speaker 1: when the timer runs out whatever is standing That's what gets scored.

422
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:53,530
Speaker 1: But then in the third one you all take turns Being the audience and they'll end like the person have a rule like clap your hands every time you place a piece.

423
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,155
Speaker 1: So I place it.

424
00:27:54,175 --> 00:27:56,230
Speaker 1: please clap my hands place a piece clap my hand.

425
00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:02,876
Speaker 0: You guys actually do a performance for the third act of the circus and that gets you points if you succeed at it If you if you miss up clapping once.

426
00:28:02,896 --> 00:28:05,004
Speaker 0: this is why the other people aren't doing it simultaneously.

427
00:28:05,024 --> 00:28:06,470
Speaker 0: They're judging you're clapping.

428
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:07,755
Speaker 0: They're like, yeah be clapped.

429
00:28:08,016 --> 00:28:08,236
Speaker 0: Nope.

430
00:28:08,357 --> 00:28:08,979
Speaker 0: She didn't clap.

431
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,187
Speaker 1: No, the good news is they're all objective things.

432
00:28:11,207 --> 00:28:12,070
Speaker 1: There's no ambiguity.

433
00:28:13,271 --> 00:28:14,032
Speaker 0: Very well-written.

434
00:28:14,072 --> 00:28:15,595
Speaker 0: you're not gonna be able to like unfair.

435
00:28:15,615 --> 00:28:16,817
Speaker 0: You're never gonna have a question of like.

436
00:28:17,098 --> 00:28:18,180
Speaker 0: was that a clap?

437
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,097
Speaker 0: You know, it's like.

438
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:21,009
Speaker 0: no it's pretty clear.

439
00:28:21,412 --> 00:28:24,488
Speaker 1: the most fun part of that piece of the game is that one.

440
00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:27,983
Speaker 1: everyone People tend to choke in that part and that's just really funny.

441
00:28:28,023 --> 00:28:28,927
Speaker 0: to have one shot.

442
00:28:28,947 --> 00:28:29,750
Speaker 0: You still got the timer.

443
00:28:29,871 --> 00:28:30,695
Speaker 0: You're all by yourself.

444
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:31,741
Speaker 0: Everyone's looking at you.

445
00:28:31,841 --> 00:28:36,630
Speaker 1: Yeah when I mess up in the first round No one really notices they're busy with their own crap and you're performing right?

446
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:36,951
Speaker 0: It's like.

447
00:28:36,991 --> 00:28:41,090
Speaker 0: it's like more circus role-playing even though you're still just stacking meeples together.

448
00:28:41,431 --> 00:28:45,644
Speaker 1: But - you don't say anything if you're in the audience.

449
00:28:45,744 --> 00:28:51,830
Speaker 1: if the person messes up their performance Like if they forget to clap once I can write it like a role play the audience.

450
00:28:52,811 --> 00:28:54,056
Speaker 1: No, no, the audience just be quiet.

451
00:28:54,096 --> 00:28:54,658
Speaker 1: Don't let him know.

452
00:28:54,698 --> 00:28:58,290
Speaker 1: so they keep doing it not realizing that they failed long ago.

453
00:28:58,471 --> 00:28:59,074
Speaker 0: Oh, no, but I could.

454
00:28:59,094 --> 00:29:00,644
Speaker 0: I could just boo at their bad circus.

455
00:29:01,087 --> 00:29:06,368
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah satisfied that clown sucks And if Dumbo comes out, yeah.

456
00:29:07,431 --> 00:29:13,824
Speaker 1: So the game was set up in the first look area at PAX, which is a pretty good area in general.

457
00:29:13,844 --> 00:29:15,877
Speaker 1: It's kind of an aside But I think it's worth it to talk about it.

458
00:29:15,897 --> 00:29:20,029
Speaker 0: It's an area that was created at Unplugged and it's unplugged the table top PAX.

459
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:25,190
Speaker 0: We scooped up some games from Essen like board games that aren't like published widely in the u.s.

460
00:29:25,251 --> 00:29:27,450
Speaker 0: Yet the kind of games you can't get at your game store.

461
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:32,970
Speaker 0: There's only a few copies so far like preview copies stuff like that games that are like the newest newest hotness.

462
00:29:33,252 --> 00:29:34,681
Speaker 0: They're not gonna be in the library.

463
00:29:34,762 --> 00:29:35,929
Speaker 0: No one's gonna bring them to PAX.

464
00:29:36,371 --> 00:29:41,849
Speaker 0: these are like the only copies you're gonna see for like maybe another few months before they come out in the game store.

465
00:29:41,869 --> 00:29:43,849
Speaker 0: and Here they are at PAX.

466
00:29:44,031 --> 00:29:46,770
Speaker 0: They're set up already on tables where they have a permanent home.

467
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:50,148
Speaker 0: You sit down and play them when no one else is playing a minute and unplugged.

468
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:53,450
Speaker 0: These games were highly trafficked in a very visible area.

469
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:57,890
Speaker 0: You couldn't sit down to play any of them because everyone was board game fans playing them all the time.

470
00:29:58,291 --> 00:29:59,094
Speaker 0: But it packs out.

471
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:04,770
Speaker 0: they were in the back and hidden and no one noticed them or cared about them and they weren't on the printed Books in the map or anything.

472
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:08,630
Speaker 0: So you could totally go over there if you knew what was what and play them to your heart's content.

473
00:30:09,212 --> 00:30:16,728
Speaker 1: So I really like meeple circus and I think a lot of people would probably enjoy they should buy it But I don't think it's a game that I would buy myself.

474
00:30:17,771 --> 00:30:35,056
Speaker 1: The the few problems I see with it based on talking to people who have played it a bunch more or people who were saying Forcers observing people playing this game over the course of entire packs is that if you play this game more than occasionally You can pretty much get to the point of Perfectly stacking every time.

475
00:30:35,076 --> 00:30:40,435
Speaker 0: and I played the game one time and I got the maximum points Available to me.

476
00:30:40,495 --> 00:30:43,290
Speaker 0: based on the cards that were available in the game.

477
00:30:43,511 --> 00:30:49,977
Speaker 0: I could not have gotten any more points than I was gotten and it reminds me actually a lot in that way With potion explosion.

478
00:30:50,078 --> 00:30:52,670
Speaker 0: Yeah and potion explosion is a game with a fun gimmick.

479
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:57,010
Speaker 0: It's marble machine and meeple circus is a fun gimmick an app and stacking all kinds of cool meeples.

480
00:30:57,674 --> 00:31:00,570
Speaker 0: But there's a you the way the mech scoring mechanism works.

481
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:04,426
Speaker 0: This is the maximum score you can get and you either hit the maximum or you don't.

482
00:31:04,486 --> 00:31:07,780
Speaker 0: and potion explosion It's two potions a turn and a meeple circus.

483
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,170
Speaker 0: is just all your meeples stacked correctly?

484
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,509
Speaker 1: What did you draft and what gets scored?

485
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:26,490
Speaker 0: Yep So as long as you're a stacking skill is up to snuff and you're not a small child Or someone, you know who can't stack meeples for some reason You're going to get the maximum points and the game comes down to the drafting part.

486
00:31:27,871 --> 00:31:34,930
Speaker 0: So it's just the drafting part and I think you know on the one hand that reduces the replay value of meeple circus itself.

487
00:31:35,473 --> 00:31:38,610
Speaker 0: But on the other hand, I don't think the game is actually a problem.

488
00:31:38,831 --> 00:31:43,390
Speaker 0: I think the problem is simply that the game needs more pieces to make it harder.

489
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:52,430
Speaker 0: It needs an expansion or something to where it's like, alright, no, no No, literally you're gonna have so many meeples and so many things going on that are so ridiculous.

490
00:31:52,752 --> 00:32:05,929
Speaker 0: You cannot score maximum points, you know But you got to calculate what the best you think you can do is and then it's like, alright This is the best I think I can do but I could get one more guy standing on a wall.

491
00:32:06,651 --> 00:32:08,841
Speaker 0: Do I go for it or not?

492
00:32:08,982 --> 00:32:14,110
Speaker 1: You know me know the app is going to do Like we've all been watching the Olympics lately, you know the figure scene and all that.

493
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:16,530
Speaker 1: So I think of it if the game had a little more components.

494
00:32:17,076 --> 00:32:17,947
Speaker 1: It has this aspect.

495
00:32:17,988 --> 00:32:18,371
Speaker 1: now Which is?

496
00:32:18,391 --> 00:32:33,187
Speaker 1: this aspect breaks down among skilled players that you choose how ambitious you want to be and You can if you increase your maximum score by trying something that's very difficult That might pan out or you might knock it down at the last second and score nothing.

497
00:32:33,448 --> 00:32:37,837
Speaker 1: Yep So if you added a few more pieces I think you could extend that feeling.

498
00:32:37,857 --> 00:32:50,818
Speaker 0: the game needs to give you more pieces and more scoring mechanisms to the point at which Nobody can possibly get the maximum score possible with their own meeples unless they're a god Perfect balance and not right.

499
00:32:51,099 --> 00:33:00,210
Speaker 0: plus, you know the imperfections of the meeples themselves and the table You're playing on and all that comes into play Such that you have to figure out how much you're gonna risk.

500
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:07,170
Speaker 0: Are you gonna go for that crazy move where you get four perfectly round things all stacked on each other or not?

501
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:07,671
Speaker 0: All right.

502
00:33:07,691 --> 00:33:08,495
Speaker 0: Are you gonna go for it?

503
00:33:08,616 --> 00:33:09,741
Speaker 0: How high do you want to make?

504
00:33:10,203 --> 00:33:11,530
Speaker 0: put a stick vertically?

505
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:12,917
Speaker 0: Which you're not allowed to do actually.

506
00:33:12,977 --> 00:33:17,177
Speaker 0: but you know just to get your red guy even higher You're gonna put another elephant up at the top.

507
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:20,468
Speaker 1: So there is one problem with the game.

508
00:33:20,488 --> 00:33:20,910
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

509
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:21,835
Speaker 1: I'm looking at the back of the box.

510
00:33:21,855 --> 00:33:23,564
Speaker 1: I think it shows a stick vertical.

511
00:33:23,967 --> 00:33:24,590
Speaker 1: It totally does.

512
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:25,374
Speaker 1: There's a vertical stick.

513
00:33:25,394 --> 00:33:28,930
Speaker 0: I think there was a rule that there's like pieces had to be played in a certain way.

514
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,456
Speaker 1: So this is a problem with the game.

515
00:33:30,496 --> 00:33:45,518
Speaker 1: the rules as they are in the printing that we had access to Oh, they're not real well-written enough are ambiguous to the point that they are unusable and we had to make a lot of value judgments as to how Pieces could actually be played.

516
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:48,430
Speaker 1: Can I lay this elephant on his side about about upside down?

517
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:49,953
Speaker 1: Can I put the stick vertically?

518
00:33:50,354 --> 00:33:56,825
Speaker 1: people's people who taught us the game said things were not allowed that are clearly drawn on the back of the box.

519
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:02,547
Speaker 1: So that is a problem and I don't know if there's official errata or anything yet.

520
00:34:02,588 --> 00:34:03,190
Speaker 1: We didn't look into that.

521
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,018
Speaker 1: We kind of just didn't care.

522
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:04,845
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not.

523
00:34:04,885 --> 00:34:05,350
Speaker 0: it's not a game.

524
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,629
Speaker 0: That's so serious that it's worth your time to look into that.

525
00:34:08,405 --> 00:34:12,206
Speaker 0: But yeah There are some questions like can an elephant be laying on its side or does have to be standing up?

526
00:34:12,286 --> 00:34:15,300
Speaker 0: it can definitely be on Its head or standing up but can it be on its side?

527
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:15,661
Speaker 0: I don't know.

528
00:34:16,184 --> 00:34:17,449
Speaker 0: I put my camel's humps down.

529
00:34:18,192 --> 00:34:24,710
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, the pieces are well designed though in that they're mostly capable of similar equivalent scores.

530
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:32,723
Speaker 0: Yeah There's like a highly varied an interesting collection of different kinds of meeples that have interesting shapes like, you know You set a camel up.

531
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:35,329
Speaker 0: It's like okay You got this round ball that will roll around.

532
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:39,527
Speaker 0: You just put a camel and put the ball between its humps and now you know the guy standing on that.

533
00:34:39,768 --> 00:34:42,949
Speaker 0: and now you got A guy standing on a ball and you got points, right?

534
00:34:43,534 --> 00:34:46,150
Speaker 0: Or you can be like me and balance a guy standing on a ball like a badass.

535
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:52,126
Speaker 1: Now the game does have an app and it's sort of required but all the app does.

536
00:34:52,226 --> 00:34:58,570
Speaker 1: the only thing it does is Play the timer of how long you have on your turn, but the circus music is essential.

537
00:34:58,771 --> 00:34:59,093
Speaker 1: It plays.

538
00:34:59,113 --> 00:35:00,221
Speaker 1: some did it did it?

539
00:35:00,261 --> 00:35:01,409
Speaker 1: did it style circus music?

540
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:02,733
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, and it has.

541
00:35:02,953 --> 00:35:23,154
Speaker 1: no it has some symbols like shh and they'll come in in different intervals to sort of tell you when you're running out of time But I will admit I actually would have preferred to just have a countdown timer Telling me exactly how many seconds I had left because I didn't play the game enough times to internalize What the like.

542
00:35:23,516 --> 00:35:25,566
Speaker 1: everyone seemed to be very worried.

543
00:35:25,586 --> 00:35:29,910
Speaker 0: time would run out And I think part of it was that we were keeping the app off to the side.

544
00:35:30,191 --> 00:35:33,305
Speaker 0: We should have put the app front and center on the table so it could be more visible.

545
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:39,891
Speaker 1: true true But still the that gives you a lot more time than you think but you'll have to play it a bunch to Enter.

546
00:35:39,931 --> 00:35:40,412
Speaker 1: never.

547
00:35:40,492 --> 00:35:41,455
Speaker 0: I was never rules.

548
00:35:41,656 --> 00:35:46,610
Speaker 0: I played, you know, somewhat hurriedly not super rushed, but I always came in under the clock.

549
00:35:46,692 --> 00:35:49,902
Speaker 0: It was never At least not as I maybe I'm remembering.

550
00:35:49,942 --> 00:35:52,394
Speaker 0: wrong because I have my memory is awful But I don't remember.

551
00:35:52,414 --> 00:35:56,850
Speaker 1: one time I knocked my thing over and I couldn't rebuild the entire thing in time before the time ran.

552
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:59,582
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you can still build how just get as many points as you can.

553
00:35:59,642 --> 00:36:00,346
Speaker 1: I built something.

554
00:36:00,486 --> 00:36:07,929
Speaker 1: Yeah, wasn't great No, but I feel like I don't know if I want to own this game because I own a lot of games and I don't Know how much play it would get if I tried to play it a lot.

555
00:36:08,071 --> 00:36:12,600
Speaker 0: I feel like this is kind of game where it's like if someone else busted out I'll play it if there's an expansion.

556
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,030
Speaker 0: I definitely want to play it again for sure.

557
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:19,650
Speaker 1: I want to see an expansion that it adds a round where you have to do a dexterity like flick kind of thing.

558
00:36:20,691 --> 00:36:24,810
Speaker 0: But yeah, I feel like if I bought it, it wouldn't get played really very much at all.

559
00:36:26,072 --> 00:36:38,690
Speaker 0: But the one case where I would buy it is if I was in some sort of family situation with small children Anyone who is below a school any situation where you can have a lot of players who are below the skill cap?

560
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,868
Speaker 0: Who will not get perfect?

561
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:50,669
Speaker 1: You know stacking every time like if I hosted game nights for like different people on a regular basis as opposed to just like our Local friends, I would probably have this and bust it out.

562
00:36:51,071 --> 00:36:53,159
Speaker 0: It's the kind of game where like people are.

563
00:36:53,219 --> 00:36:59,590
Speaker 0: I don't know who's gonna want to play this game over and over and over again But you can playing it for the first time is a hell of blast.

564
00:36:59,992 --> 00:37:04,555
Speaker 0: So as long as you keep playing it with different people all the time You definitely want to.

565
00:37:04,575 --> 00:37:07,203
Speaker 0: you know get a copy because it does make a spectacle.

566
00:37:07,224 --> 00:37:09,190
Speaker 0: definitely got to go into a gaming library.

567
00:37:09,351 --> 00:37:10,581
Speaker 0: It's got to go at a convention.

568
00:37:10,642 --> 00:37:13,089
Speaker 0: It's got to go to school It's got to go at a meet-up.

569
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:13,552
Speaker 0: If you

570
00:37:13,632 --> 00:37:22,755
Speaker 1: set this up somewhere like in the middle of a like mid-tier convention or like a meet-up or something It'll gather a crowd of people who will just want to watch Mm-hmm like it

571
00:37:23,077 --> 00:37:28,141
Speaker 0: and people who want to play it like one two three times You know, so children might get hooked on it and keep playing.

572
00:37:28,161 --> 00:37:30,190
Speaker 0: but I think adults will play a few times and be done.

573
00:37:30,319 --> 00:37:36,609
Speaker 1: Yeah I met some people at PAX who had played it to the point that they had completely ruined it and there was no further Replay value at all.

574
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:42,050
Speaker 0: But but I think an expansion that's complex enough could make it fun for quite a while.

575
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:43,057
Speaker 1: I feel like one.

576
00:37:43,077 --> 00:37:49,123
Speaker 0: actually if you added in stuff like you just said like the Looking mode one like flick like round one do a stack.

577
00:37:49,384 --> 00:37:50,568
Speaker 1: round two do a trick.

578
00:37:51,591 --> 00:37:53,096
Speaker 1: Round three do a stack.

579
00:37:53,196 --> 00:37:57,610
Speaker 1: round four the performance that involves a stack and a dexterity move, right?

580
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:00,885
Speaker 0: So I think think the way you do it I think you would set it up like all.

581
00:38:01,228 --> 00:38:05,368
Speaker 0: right You make your stack you score it and then you have to do the trick.

582
00:38:05,509 --> 00:38:07,055
Speaker 1: after The stack.

583
00:38:07,196 --> 00:38:08,803
Speaker 0: your trick is gonna mess up your thing.

584
00:38:08,863 --> 00:38:10,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, or do it separately.

585
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:18,127
Speaker 0: It's like okay you have to make a stack and you have to set up a trick and execute the trick separately like okay I'll make a seesaw here and flick a guy and he has to.

586
00:38:18,228 --> 00:38:22,003
Speaker 0: you know I'll make a human cannonball over here and get a guy to hit another guy.

587
00:38:22,064 --> 00:38:22,224
Speaker 0: good.

588
00:38:22,244 --> 00:38:25,256
Speaker 0: I did it and I'll make my stack Something like that.

589
00:38:25,438 --> 00:38:26,042
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

590
00:38:26,284 --> 00:38:32,868
Speaker 0: but at least as it is Despite its minor flaws in terms maybe add like another act to the circus and that's the area.

591
00:38:32,928 --> 00:38:33,350
Speaker 0: do a trick.

592
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:45,050
Speaker 1: So it's like stack trick in act two and then act three, you know I don't know because the game the game took a while to play but a lot of that was debates over what was legal placement.

593
00:38:45,891 --> 00:38:50,390
Speaker 0: Do again to the point not take long at all because rounds one and two are completely simultaneous.

594
00:38:50,491 --> 00:38:55,726
Speaker 0: So no matter how many players you have round one and two will always take the same amount of time Which is less than 15 minutes.

595
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:58,537
Speaker 0: Yeah If you include the scoring and then the round.

596
00:38:58,618 --> 00:39:03,940
Speaker 0: three is gonna increase linearly based on how many players you have But it only goes up to how many players.

597
00:39:04,001 --> 00:39:05,268
Speaker 1: five maybe two to five.

598
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:14,373
Speaker 0: Yeah So if you have five players, you know, it takes maybe what it's gonna take you another I don't know 30 minutes at the most People.

599
00:39:14,414 --> 00:39:17,530
Speaker 0: so that means that puts this game under an hour with five players.

600
00:39:17,912 --> 00:39:26,130
Speaker 1: I people at PAX explicitly said they do this if they have a four-player game Two of the people will do their performances in the third round simultaneously and each one has a judge.

601
00:39:26,431 --> 00:39:27,176
Speaker 1: Yeah, then they swap.

602
00:39:27,236 --> 00:39:28,182
Speaker 0: that'll speed things up.

603
00:39:28,242 --> 00:39:32,700
Speaker 0: It'll literally cut the time in half But you will lose the enjoyment of seeing everyone's performance.

604
00:39:32,881 --> 00:39:35,570
Speaker 1: Yep, but you do not need the app.

605
00:39:35,711 --> 00:39:36,696
Speaker 1: That is one thing to make clear.

606
00:39:36,716 --> 00:39:38,746
Speaker 1: The app is just a timer XCOM.

607
00:39:38,786 --> 00:39:39,450
Speaker 0: You need the app.

608
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:44,030
Speaker 0: You do not need it in meeple circus because when I said they'll probably want to use I sat down at the table.

609
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:48,033
Speaker 1: I was like, I want to play this game and then the guy who's gonna teach us is like our idea Have the app.

610
00:39:48,173 --> 00:39:50,784
Speaker 1: and immediately I was like, maybe I don't want to play this.

611
00:39:50,804 --> 00:39:51,145
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

612
00:39:51,567 --> 00:39:53,575
Speaker 1: But then he was like, no, no No, it's just a timer.

613
00:39:53,755 --> 00:39:53,936
Speaker 0: Yep.

614
00:39:54,137 --> 00:39:55,602
Speaker 1: You don't actually need it.

615
00:39:55,823 --> 00:39:56,505
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

616
00:39:56,545 --> 00:39:57,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a pretty good game.

617
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:59,521
Speaker 1: There's a lot of people who probably should buy it.

618
00:39:59,622 --> 00:40:00,105
Speaker 1: It's not one.

619
00:40:00,165 --> 00:40:00,930
Speaker 0: I did the most thing.

620
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:01,652
Speaker 0: I just can't believe.

621
00:40:01,712 --> 00:40:02,515
Speaker 0: no one did this earlier.

622
00:40:03,137 --> 00:40:03,679
Speaker 1: I know right?

623
00:40:03,759 --> 00:40:11,870
Speaker 1: It's A lot of Americana style board games that do this in a very simple.

624
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:16,910
Speaker 0: I'm sorry about this specific thing of make a game out of the fact that everyone stacks meeples all the time.

625
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,675
Speaker 0: Yeah, everyone does this thing.

626
00:40:18,715 --> 00:40:20,260
Speaker 0: Maybe we should make it the right way.

627
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,343
Speaker 1: Why the meeple?

628
00:40:21,424 --> 00:40:23,632
Speaker 0: I've been stacking meeple since 2000.

629
00:40:23,632 --> 00:40:25,429
Speaker 0: Oh something why did it take until?

630
00:40:25,429 --> 00:40:29,527
Speaker 0: 17 for this game to come out?

631
00:40:30,252 --> 00:40:34,050
Speaker 1: But if any of you do have it and you bring it to a PAX, I'll probably play it at least once.

632
00:40:34,271 --> 00:40:35,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'd play like once.

633
00:40:35,279 --> 00:40:45,110
