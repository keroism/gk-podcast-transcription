1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,078
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, September 2nd, 2021.

2
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:11,600
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,946
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:13,986 --> 00:00:19,149
Speaker 1: tonight We are talking about outerwear like jackets and shit.

5
00:00:20,192 --> 00:00:21,207
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:23,776 --> 00:00:37,330
Speaker 1: so, uh Yesterday, I know Scott was going to tennis and I was just home doing my thing and I was sitting around the evening and I had a concept in my head of what the weather forecast was which was some rain will come but it's no big deal.

7
00:00:37,911 --> 00:00:47,819
Speaker 1: But then the weather started changing really rapidly and then I go online and the forecast went from a little bit of rain to Massive dangerous thunderstorm shelter in place.

8
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,030
Speaker 1: that storm system came out of almost nowhere.

9
00:00:52,593 --> 00:00:54,530
Speaker 0: That wasn't what I. so I knew it was gonna.

10
00:00:54,711 --> 00:00:59,570
Speaker 0: I thought it was basically gonna rain all day and I knew the remnants of the hurricane were coming in right later.

11
00:01:00,032 --> 00:01:15,501
Speaker 0: But we were only going to the tennis from noon to 5 and then eating dinner and then going home and I figured we were Gonna just beat the horrible rain home You know and I knew it was probably gonna be a bad rain But I didn't think it was gonna be as bad as it was obviously.

12
00:01:15,521 --> 00:01:18,090
Speaker 0: Yep, but I'm saying the hurricane remnants.

13
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:23,410
Speaker 0: I guess I think the hurricane just lost less energy than we thought it was gonna lose on its way up.

14
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:24,681
Speaker 1: Well from what I gather I was looking.

15
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:39,850
Speaker 1: I was reading some weather calm like reporting on it because I was surprised by it is The system strengthened suddenly and rapidly in Pennsylvania like a bunch of stuff happened along the way But it happened so quickly that the forecast changed way too late for anyone to react to it.

16
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,608
Speaker 0: Mmm, so yeah, usually because usually what happens is once a hurricanes on land.

17
00:01:44,628 --> 00:01:47,778
Speaker 0: There's no Ocean under it for it to get more water.

18
00:01:47,798 --> 00:01:53,809
Speaker 0: So it was just losing water right onto the ground And I guess somehow it gained power even in on land.

19
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:05,410
Speaker 1: well, sometimes you get situations like I don't you ever experienced like an actual direct show where a Storm will sort of like there'll be a thunderstorm and the forecast is even like yeah thunderstorm But suddenly it's not a tornado.

20
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:15,172
Speaker 1: The thunderstorm just gets really really really really strong over the matter of minutes out of nowhere And it has a constant wind going in one direction Mm-hmm.

21
00:02:16,016 --> 00:02:21,139
Speaker 1: It's a kind of scary if it happens to you and you're outside Especially if you're like out in the woods or something.

22
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:37,250
Speaker 1: I got hit by one on a hike long ago but The rain that came down officially was the most intense hour of rainfall New York City has ever experienced in our recorded history of trying to track how much rain falls in this area

23
00:02:37,871 --> 00:02:39,054
Speaker 0: Measured in inches in

24
00:02:39,115 --> 00:02:42,423
Speaker 1: inches the second most rainfall.

25
00:02:42,744 --> 00:02:59,810
Speaker 1: the previous record was from two weeks ago Yep, so climate change is real and everyone who is resisting drastic societal changes to address This is honestly in my opinion literally committing violence against society and everyone who lives here against humanity.

26
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:04,347
Speaker 1: Yep, like that's a crime against humanity at this point, and I don't know what we can do about it.

27
00:03:04,368 --> 00:03:07,383
Speaker 0: like Cut Captain Planet was on fucking TV.

28
00:03:07,444 --> 00:03:08,409
Speaker 0: How many years ago?

29
00:03:10,372 --> 00:03:11,476
Speaker 1: Al Gore had his book.

30
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,630
Speaker 0: I was in before out before anyone who Al Gore was in first grade.

31
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,918
Speaker 0: They were telling us reduce reuse and recycle.

32
00:03:18,179 --> 00:03:21,530
Speaker 0: if they were telling me that in first grade, right?

33
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:32,970
Speaker 0: It wasn't first graders who came up with that It was adults at the time when I was in first grade people who are now really old Right who decided that that's what I should have been taught in the 80 something.

34
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:39,529
Speaker 0: Yeah, so and that means most of the people at least where we are learn this fucking lesson.

35
00:03:40,611 --> 00:03:41,977
Speaker 0: How come so many people haven't learned a lesson?

36
00:03:42,117 --> 00:03:44,827
Speaker 1: if I learned in first grade and I'm old I can actually say why.

37
00:03:44,908 --> 00:03:47,355
Speaker 1: because one All environmental issues.

38
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:52,087
Speaker 1: This was a shift that started in the 90s actually started before then but it really came to fruition.

39
00:03:52,408 --> 00:04:05,623
Speaker 1: in the 2000s Anti environmental messaging became a cornerstone of right-wing messaging Solely because it was in opposition to something that was perceived as progressive or liberal Kind of like it definitely was not.

40
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:10,079
Speaker 1: until it was not most people in America didn't give a shit about a mask mandate.

41
00:04:10,179 --> 00:04:18,978
Speaker 1: if if the Republicans hadn't made masks a thing and the government had just Been like yeah wear masks for the foreseeable future It probably wouldn't have been nearly as contentious of an issue.

42
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,509
Speaker 1: But instead it became a partisan shibboleth.

43
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:26,888
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you know in the in the 80s and 90s, you know, it was just like yeah.

44
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:32,762
Speaker 0: Well, and you know, no there was no one around who was like cats and planets the bad guy Let's fuck the environs.

45
00:04:32,823 --> 00:04:33,489
Speaker 0: No one that I saw.

46
00:04:33,572 --> 00:04:42,356
Speaker 1: Yeah But like literal like Republican platform and what a good chunk of Americans believe is one climate change is a myth - even if it's happening Who gives a shit?

47
00:04:42,638 --> 00:04:44,090
Speaker 1: and three we should actively pollute?

48
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,058
Speaker 1: Like that third one you I think I'm joking.

49
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,343
Speaker 1: I am NOT.

50
00:04:48,384 --> 00:04:55,066
Speaker 1: that is there are a Surprising number of people who advocate that we should pollute more and exploit the environment more.

51
00:04:55,447 --> 00:04:59,598
Speaker 1: and the argument is God gave us earth to exploit.

52
00:04:59,638 --> 00:05:02,328
Speaker 1: He would never let us harm it so bad that it would come back to bite us.

53
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:06,795
Speaker 0: There's many different arguments right?

54
00:05:06,815 --> 00:05:09,102
Speaker 0: there's the argument of it makes me more money.

55
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:11,650
Speaker 0: therefore, I'll convince some doofus to support it.

56
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,257
Speaker 1: There's the argument.

57
00:05:13,357 --> 00:05:15,367
Speaker 0: I think it's a problem for no reason.

58
00:05:15,809 --> 00:05:19,844
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm just I'm a bully the kind of person who would have been.

59
00:05:19,864 --> 00:05:23,818
Speaker 0: it was a bully in school And I just like doing it makes other people mad.

60
00:05:23,878 --> 00:05:24,239
Speaker 0: Therefore.

61
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:24,962
Speaker 0: It makes me happy.

62
00:05:25,002 --> 00:05:31,184
Speaker 0: I don't really care about what the consequences are Yep, but this is only gonna get worse.

63
00:05:31,204 --> 00:05:38,929
Speaker 1: New York City got fucked up last I saw I think 25 people are dead and there's still a lot of people unaccounted for and New Jersey also is in a state of emergency.

64
00:05:39,895 --> 00:05:40,990
Speaker 1: We have not recovered from this.

65
00:05:41,071 --> 00:05:46,170
Speaker 1: I haven't even been outside yet But from what I can tell there is significant damage even a few blocks away from our apartment.

66
00:05:46,271 --> 00:05:49,629
Speaker 1: We just happen to live literally at the highest point in Long Island City.

67
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:50,818
Speaker 0: Well, I'm not.

68
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:55,120
Speaker 0: I'm not at the highest point But you know the height doesn't really matter so much right?

69
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,544
Speaker 0: because if you look at the flood map.

70
00:05:56,605 --> 00:05:58,050
Speaker 0: the flood map is for.

71
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:03,044
Speaker 0: You know storm surge, you know situations like where the river is coming up, right?

72
00:06:03,325 --> 00:06:04,870
Speaker 0: That's what the flood map is measuring.

73
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:10,710
Speaker 0: So there are people who lived like not even in flood zones like in a place that's high up where it's like.

74
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:17,842
Speaker 0: You know, you're not gonna even if the sea level rises a fuck ton Your house will still be on a hill of some on land.

75
00:06:17,862 --> 00:06:19,910
Speaker 0: All right, you're gonna be just fine here.

76
00:06:20,434 --> 00:06:24,079
Speaker 0: But what happens is when it rains It's not the river.

77
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,561
Speaker 0: the river might rise sure But the it's not the river rising that causes a flood.

78
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:31,230
Speaker 0: the water lands right on you no matter how high you are.

79
00:06:31,793 --> 00:06:40,657
Speaker 0: And if it doesn't drain because the drain is clogged up Well, you're gonna know your basement still gonna flood and if you're at the top of a hill It is a little more complicated than that.

80
00:06:40,737 --> 00:06:42,844
Speaker 1: those maps imply a bunch of things.

81
00:06:42,905 --> 00:06:46,808
Speaker 1: height is the primary thing that matters But they're high definitely helps you sure.

82
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:52,022
Speaker 0: There were many high up places that still got flooded basements.

83
00:06:52,062 --> 00:06:53,446
Speaker 1: They got flooded a very different way.

84
00:06:53,486 --> 00:06:57,261
Speaker 1: There are two different like mechanisms of flooding.

85
00:06:57,705 --> 00:07:01,299
Speaker 1: one is Standing water and the other is flash flood.

86
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,310
Speaker 1: a lot of those basements flooded because an area had a lot of water pass through it.

87
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:11,084
Speaker 1: Flood waters didn't stay like the street was no longer flooded almost immediately after the rain stopped.

88
00:07:11,385 --> 00:07:21,119
Speaker 1: but on its way down The rain would find a nice basement and say hey, that's a cool place to hang out go into the base That's also and then have no situation that happens.

89
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:24,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that happened at my mom's house in Arizona a flash flood.

90
00:07:24,832 --> 00:07:29,450
Speaker 1: So there was this hill on their property and no one knew what it was there for it.

91
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,510
Speaker 1: It wasn't in any of the like topographical diagrams.

92
00:07:31,912 --> 00:07:34,984
Speaker 1: So they got rid of it because it was just annoying it in the way.

93
00:07:35,426 --> 00:07:46,787
Speaker 1: years later a Rare flash flood happened and water came streaming Straight toward the house went past where that little hill used to be and slammed right into the side of the house and completely flooded the basement.

94
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:51,103
Speaker 0: No, I mean, you know, I think you know in the city, right?

95
00:07:51,123 --> 00:07:58,485
Speaker 0: We're mostly worried about the flood situation because You know forget, you know, you know hills and drains and all that sort of situation.

96
00:07:58,907 --> 00:07:59,730
Speaker 0: Everything's concrete.

97
00:08:00,493 --> 00:08:03,284
Speaker 1: Concrete absorbs a little well, that's why there's so much but it's not.

98
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:04,670
Speaker 0: it's not dirt, right?

99
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:14,019
Speaker 1: So that's why there's so much work on all those different mitigation techniques to put green spaces dirt trees grass Yeah around because water goes.

100
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:18,238
Speaker 0: water goes in dirt It doesn't go in kind of and that'll it.

101
00:08:18,278 --> 00:08:21,510
Speaker 1: that'll give you a buffer even if those things don't drain themselves.

102
00:08:21,871 --> 00:08:26,310
Speaker 1: They'll hold more water and give you a buffer to lower the damage of flash floods.

103
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:30,583
Speaker 0: You're in a grassy field and you see a little puddle in the grassy field.

104
00:08:30,664 --> 00:08:37,993
Speaker 0: if you took all the water and sucked it out Of the grassy field and put it onto like a you know, piece of concrete you'd be up to like It'd be deep.

105
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:40,722
Speaker 0: So but if you look out and you say okay.

106
00:08:40,743 --> 00:08:42,429
Speaker 0: Well, the city's got these flooding problems.

107
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:46,102
Speaker 0: Well, how's it going out there in the in the burbs, right?

108
00:08:46,162 --> 00:08:48,470
Speaker 0: Why don't we just you know, maybe the city time is bad.

109
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:50,087
Speaker 0: It's like no actually shreds.

110
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:54,024
Speaker 0: The suburbs got a different problem, right?

111
00:08:54,065 --> 00:08:54,910
Speaker 0: They don't got flooding.

112
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,522
Speaker 0: They got some flooding going on especially in places with shitty infrastructure.

113
00:08:58,563 --> 00:08:58,683
Speaker 0: who?

114
00:08:58,743 --> 00:09:00,730
Speaker 0: nor bad geographies or topologies.

115
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:05,070
Speaker 0: But their situation is they the trees the trees that are so good.

116
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:09,010
Speaker 0: They got knocked down by the wind and then you get your powers gets cut out.

117
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:15,250
Speaker 0: I know my parent my my mom the big giant tree in the front lawn that's been there forever.

118
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:19,270
Speaker 0: You know, she's or we already lost a shit ton of trees over the years.

119
00:09:19,772 --> 00:09:22,790
Speaker 0: The big tree went down it knocked to hit all the power lines.

120
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,783
Speaker 0: Luckily, it went down towards the street and not onto anyone's house or anything.

121
00:09:26,823 --> 00:09:31,318
Speaker 0: So I can't say that trees enormous And yeah, cut took the power right out.

122
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:39,447
Speaker 1: every single person who lives in New York City Even if they had to deal with some flooding Showed up at work today like online like they all dialed in.

123
00:09:40,031 --> 00:09:44,686
Speaker 1: Almost everyone who lived upstate couldn't had no power and couldn't kill or no internet and couldn't get to work.

124
00:09:45,488 --> 00:09:52,516
Speaker 0: Yep So, yeah, I mean the other thing is that in the city, you know, it's like yeah, there's a flood But the flood is mostly hitting.

125
00:09:52,536 --> 00:09:59,127
Speaker 0: it's gonna hurt you the most if you're in the basement or first-level Abode which is often this I'm on the floor.

126
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:04,104
Speaker 0: Yeah, I haven't done the math on this but I'm gonna check to see.

127
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,570
Speaker 0: but I feel like all right.

128
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,690
Speaker 0: Tell me if this if this seems reasonable to you, right?

129
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:18,770
Speaker 0: Cuz usually when the when you hear them talking about like sea level rise climate predictions They're talking about like inches which is very significant like if the sea goes up a few inches, that's a big fucking deal, right?

130
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:29,109
Speaker 0: yeah, that's disastrous, but I it feels like okay if that much ridiculous climate change is gonna rise things by inches Which is still devastating and bad, right?

131
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,715
Speaker 0: I'm five stories up.

132
00:10:32,397 --> 00:10:38,629
Speaker 0: I feel like if all the ice and all the glaciers on earth melted Well, I'd probably be dead for many other reasons.

133
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:45,956
Speaker 0: But I feel like even then the water wouldn't reach the fifth floor, yeah, but that's Literally worthless knowledge.

134
00:10:45,976 --> 00:10:58,987
Speaker 0: that doesn't do anything because I didn't say but I just saying like so but you know if that won't reach the fifth floor then I Floods, you know that are happening now aren't gonna hit the fifth floor now.

135
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:06,870
Speaker 0: So if we just put buildings up on some stilts or whatever that's gonna keep us at least our shit dry for a little while.

136
00:11:07,091 --> 00:11:08,698
Speaker 1: But you know, it can't just go up on stilts.

137
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:12,632
Speaker 1: all the infrastructure like a giant building not like Electricity.

138
00:11:12,652 --> 00:11:14,057
Speaker 1: Yeah the internet pipe.

139
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:15,543
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, they'll be poop.

140
00:11:15,563 --> 00:11:17,049
Speaker 0: There'll be poop rivers underneath your build.

141
00:11:17,069 --> 00:11:17,747
Speaker 0: their house Yeah, sure.

142
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,617
Speaker 1: But also the way it will be.

143
00:11:19,817 --> 00:11:23,130
Speaker 1: your places like places where floods happen more often or people build around it.

144
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:23,511
Speaker 1: Usually.

145
00:11:23,531 --> 00:11:32,110
Speaker 1: what they do is all the nice stuff is on the second and third floor and the first floor is built in a way To where if it gets flooded you have to gut it and rebuild it.

146
00:11:32,251 --> 00:11:35,590
Speaker 1: It's really easy and cheap to do and you can keep living in the top while that happens.

147
00:11:36,051 --> 00:11:42,170
Speaker 0: Yep, just one more thing to mention is that of course you can listen to famous geek night's Thursday episode water in the ceiling.

148
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:43,957
Speaker 0: Yeah in the city.

149
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:47,250
Speaker 0: He got a lot of flat roofs and not necessarily the nice pointy roofs.

150
00:11:47,595 --> 00:11:54,470
Speaker 1: Oh, you know, yep Some people had water from the ceiling and water from the ground But I must say there was a lot of water in the ceiling yesterday.

151
00:11:54,671 --> 00:12:00,745
Speaker 1: You saw the videos of what was happening to apartments in the city, especially poorer parts of the city.

152
00:12:01,752 --> 00:12:06,110
Speaker 1: Remember that scene if you saw a parasite where the rain happens at the end and that's a real thing.

153
00:12:06,411 --> 00:12:14,743
Speaker 1: So water is coming up from the ground and if you can imagine where the water coming up from the ground comes from It's really gonna come from primarily your toilet.

154
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:19,277
Speaker 1: Yep, so I would argue that categorically.

155
00:12:19,297 --> 00:12:23,109
Speaker 1: I will always take water coming from above compared to water coming from below.

156
00:12:23,913 --> 00:12:26,909
Speaker 0: I don't want to come from either day in any direction unless I'm in a water park.

157
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:29,557
Speaker 0: Yeah, then it comes from every direction.

158
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:30,401
Speaker 1: god there's.

159
00:12:30,481 --> 00:12:42,488
Speaker 1: I just think of the scene and it's always sunny where long story short two of the characters go to the top of a water slide that was closed and think that they can just do it and they know dump a bunch of buckets of water down it and the scene.

160
00:12:42,549 --> 00:12:43,452
Speaker 1: the way they Portray it is.

161
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:52,262
Speaker 1: you get this wide shot and you see the guy just jump and you hear this like Streaking noise and a little line of red just grows behind him.

162
00:12:52,282 --> 00:12:54,830
Speaker 1: It gets bigger and bigger and bigger and then he just stops.

163
00:12:56,571 --> 00:13:00,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's bad, yeah, so uh, how is that pre storm tennis?

164
00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:02,674
Speaker 0: Yeah, so yeah.

165
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:06,810
Speaker 0: yesterday, you know, we took a day off work, you know, cuz we're not going to PAX West.

166
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:13,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the US Open which is one of the four major world tennis tournaments is like right near us in Queens.

167
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, we never wait because it's always at the same time as packs.

168
00:13:17,533 --> 00:13:20,064
Speaker 0: Right, and I don't care about tennis that much but I like tennis.

169
00:13:20,104 --> 00:13:30,233
Speaker 1: All right, I respect the tennis Sports where I don't really follow a lot of the people I don't care that much who wins other than a very small number of people but I Will pretty much just like.

170
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:33,524
Speaker 1: watching anyone play high-level tennis is always amusing.

171
00:13:34,186 --> 00:13:34,427
Speaker 0: Yeah.

172
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:37,580
Speaker 0: So anyway So I'm like, you know what not going to PAX West.

173
00:13:38,163 --> 00:13:39,630
Speaker 0: Let's go to the tennis.

174
00:13:39,771 --> 00:13:41,609
Speaker 0: So I figured out how tennis tickets work.

175
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:47,610
Speaker 0: I think you know, we went we go over there and I learned so much about what's going on at the tennis tournament.

176
00:13:47,751 --> 00:13:48,114
Speaker 0: I don't want to.

177
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,129
Speaker 0: I guess I could spend a whole episode talking about it.

178
00:13:50,731 --> 00:13:59,083
Speaker 0: But I think all I got to say right now is that when you go to see tennis like the US Open or something like That it's not the same as going to like a hockey game.

179
00:13:59,123 --> 00:14:01,736
Speaker 0: where you go you watch a hockey game It ends you leave.

180
00:14:01,897 --> 00:14:03,225
Speaker 0: right you go you watch a baseball game.

181
00:14:03,265 --> 00:14:03,869
Speaker 0: It ends you leave.

182
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,258
Speaker 0: Basically, you're going to the packs of tennis.

183
00:14:07,378 --> 00:14:10,407
Speaker 0: It's like a convention and they're just tennis fucking everywhere.

184
00:14:10,427 --> 00:14:26,110
Speaker 0: There's Expo Hall kind of At least all over the place Right and like you can get up and walk around and look at different tennis is like they're like they're freaking pet like tennis courts are busy panel rooms and you can just go all around and see.

185
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:33,322
Speaker 0: And there's only a few that are special like the main events, you know I think there's two and a half that were like special ones.

186
00:14:33,362 --> 00:14:35,269
Speaker 0: You can't just walk into easily.

187
00:14:37,392 --> 00:14:37,995
Speaker 0: But yeah, it was.

188
00:14:38,016 --> 00:14:40,510
Speaker 0: it was actually a lot of fun even if you don't give a shit about tennis.

189
00:14:41,033 --> 00:14:43,830
Speaker 0: It was cheap because we only went for five hours in the afternoon.

190
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:50,473
Speaker 0: Right, it caused less than half of a Madison Square Garden hockey game and hockey games like three three hours Maybe right.

191
00:14:50,815 --> 00:14:51,980
Speaker 0: and I was there for five hours.

192
00:14:52,522 --> 00:14:54,190
Speaker 0: So huge huge bargain.

193
00:14:54,270 --> 00:15:00,655
Speaker 0: we sat in the ridiculous nosebleed type seats in the in the place that we had to pay and You could see just fine.

194
00:15:00,675 --> 00:15:04,690
Speaker 0: And even though we mostly saw people we didn't really know or care about.

195
00:15:05,312 --> 00:15:07,079
Speaker 0: It's like even watching no-name people.

196
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,267
Speaker 0: like everyone there is professional tennis player.

197
00:15:09,307 --> 00:15:09,749
Speaker 0: It's like whoa.

198
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:11,314
Speaker 1: That's what I was saying.

199
00:15:11,334 --> 00:15:14,465
Speaker 1: Like professional tennis is just something to see if you've never seen.

200
00:15:14,485 --> 00:15:16,675
Speaker 0: and sometimes you're really you know You're on a field court.

201
00:15:16,695 --> 00:15:18,304
Speaker 0: It's like sometimes you're really fucking close.

202
00:15:18,324 --> 00:15:19,330
Speaker 0: You just get with the ball.

203
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:23,184
Speaker 0: It's like, you know these people you'd reach out and touch him if you wanted to.

204
00:15:23,224 --> 00:15:28,789
Speaker 0: you'd get in trouble, but you know Yeah, I was surprised there weren't like fences and more security like around.

205
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:32,310
Speaker 0: Well, it's like the local tennis court has more security.

206
00:15:33,371 --> 00:15:34,718
Speaker 1: We'll get to this when we do our show.

207
00:15:34,758 --> 00:15:37,430
Speaker 1: the show we were talking about doing around likes going to sports events.

208
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:42,743
Speaker 1: But I imagine and I'm trying to say this without saying anything specifically classes.

209
00:15:43,345 --> 00:15:53,364
Speaker 1: the average person who goes to a tennis match compared to the average person who goes to an American football match is or a baseball match is far less likely to Get naked and run out onto the field.

210
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:54,309
Speaker 0: I thought about it.

211
00:15:56,552 --> 00:16:00,810
Speaker 1: I imagine that would be a situation of you're the first one and they're all like, oh shit that's never happened.

212
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,984
Speaker 0: But I was like, wow, there's really nothing stopping me from being that streaker guy.

213
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,899
Speaker 0: and I was like, well, let's see How would I do it?

214
00:16:06,101 --> 00:16:10,804
Speaker 0: All right, and then And then I was like, okay, so now I'm on the court naked running around.

215
00:16:11,186 --> 00:16:12,310
Speaker 0: what's gonna happen next?

216
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:16,050
Speaker 1: There was whatever incident where dude like ran out and stab someone though.

217
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:18,199
Speaker 0: Did that's true.

218
00:16:18,219 --> 00:16:19,549
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was a big deal.

219
00:16:20,033 --> 00:16:23,844
Speaker 0: And I was thinking about that incident when I said well This is probably what's gonna happen.

220
00:16:24,147 --> 00:16:31,634
Speaker 0: and I was like Is there any way that I could do this and have it not be terrible Monica Celeste back in 1993?

221
00:16:31,634 --> 00:16:35,962
Speaker 0: Yep, but I was like, yep There's pretty much no way I could do that and have it not be the worst.

222
00:16:36,063 --> 00:16:37,328
Speaker 0: so I'm not gonna even think about it.

223
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:38,572
Speaker 0: Yeah anymore.

224
00:16:38,592 --> 00:16:42,180
Speaker 0: It looks like if you didn't check the news I didn't do it.

225
00:16:45,831 --> 00:16:48,226
Speaker 0: Otherwise you would be like is that's good?

226
00:16:48,306 --> 00:16:57,728
Speaker 0: on the tennis One headline flood number two headline naked guy by God naked bald guy.

227
00:17:00,512 --> 00:17:03,283
Speaker 1: The other thing about the US Open is that it's not it like.

228
00:17:03,464 --> 00:17:04,869
Speaker 1: it goes on for a while.

229
00:17:04,971 --> 00:17:06,930
Speaker 1: It goes to what still like September 12th like this.

230
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:11,374
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean we could have we could have gone to it like before or after Pax But it's just.

231
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,484
Speaker 0: it's such a hat, you know, well because we won we go.

232
00:17:13,505 --> 00:17:14,369
Speaker 1: we go to Pax early.

233
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,839
Speaker 1: We usually stay at Pax a little late.

234
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,390
Speaker 1: I usually need time to get my shit together before Pax.

235
00:17:19,771 --> 00:17:21,616
Speaker 1: I'm usually too tired to do anything after Pax.

236
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:22,579
Speaker 1: So yep.

237
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,347
Speaker 0: It was yeah, I would I would go again.

238
00:17:25,367 --> 00:17:32,363
Speaker 0: I think I Don't feel like I need to go again like oh I don't want to miss it But it's like, you know, if someone was like, hey, let's go again.

239
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:36,199
Speaker 1: I'm like, alright That or any other tennis I've.

240
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:38,490
Speaker 1: I still keep thinking about playing tennis again.

241
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:48,810
Speaker 1: The only reason I haven't is that and I mentioned this on the show a long time ago But in New York City specifically you need to pay for a special city license to legally play tennis in any outdoor court.

242
00:17:50,451 --> 00:17:54,190
Speaker 0: Only the ones that have the little guard there, you know, there are some places you can play.

243
00:17:54,612 --> 00:18:01,403
Speaker 1: So any as far as I've read any New York City Official park with tennis requires that permit even if it's no attendant.

244
00:18:01,463 --> 00:18:04,434
Speaker 1: and legally, I'm saying yes But there are.

245
00:18:04,695 --> 00:18:06,040
Speaker 0: there are places like.

246
00:18:06,101 --> 00:18:08,430
Speaker 0: they'll be like, you know some like playground or basketball.

247
00:18:08,772 --> 00:18:12,450
Speaker 1: Usually those are actually covered by that rule the ones that aren't my private.

248
00:18:13,153 --> 00:18:15,624
Speaker 0: There are places like the back of this like a middle school.

249
00:18:15,684 --> 00:18:26,504
Speaker 0: over here behind the middle school It's just a field of concrete right and there's some basketball hoops and there's some paint on the ground and you know It's barely populated whatever and there happens to be a tennis court painted on the ground.

250
00:18:26,945 --> 00:18:30,863
Speaker 0: if you just put a net there You know with so your weight weight.

251
00:18:30,884 --> 00:18:31,789
Speaker 1: There's no net there.

252
00:18:33,491 --> 00:18:34,517
Speaker 0: No, you have to bring one.

253
00:18:34,838 --> 00:18:36,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that's not really usable.

254
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:41,262
Speaker 0: Also, I bet it's it's a floor and you could put a net there and play 10.

255
00:18:41,262 --> 00:18:43,430
Speaker 1: also concrete playing tennis on concrete sucks ass.

256
00:18:43,611 --> 00:18:46,146
Speaker 0: And also I'm just saying you could play tennis there.

257
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:46,810
Speaker 0: No one's stopping.

258
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:50,753
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm not gonna buy a net and carry with me on my bike and also I Suspect.

259
00:18:51,114 --> 00:18:57,056
Speaker 1: if I went there with another adult and just started playing tennis with my own net No, I would give a shit.

260
00:18:57,076 --> 00:18:58,160
Speaker 1: I'm pretty confident.

261
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:00,310
Speaker 1: I would get trespassed off of that place by a cop.

262
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:02,082
Speaker 0: It's a public park.

263
00:19:02,122 --> 00:19:04,156
Speaker 0: No one's gonna give a shit If it's a public party.

264
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:09,541
Speaker 0: people people play volleyball in public parks all the fucking time Because volleyball does not have a licensing system.

265
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:10,163
Speaker 1: Like tennis does.

266
00:19:10,204 --> 00:19:11,590
Speaker 1: tennis is unique in New York City.

267
00:19:12,092 --> 00:19:13,518
Speaker 0: There's all kinds of people.

268
00:19:13,538 --> 00:19:14,582
Speaker 0: you can you can't there.

269
00:19:14,703 --> 00:19:20,370
Speaker 0: you can play guerrilla tennis But the thing is why would you when you can get the license and play on a nice tennis court?

270
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,756
Speaker 1: Even then I did look into that.

271
00:19:21,816 --> 00:19:22,459
Speaker 1: with the license.

272
00:19:22,881 --> 00:19:27,690
Speaker 1: every good tennis court has you have to put in Reservations way in advance and you get like an hour to play at a time.

273
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:28,755
Speaker 1: It's a giant pain in the ass.

274
00:19:29,057 --> 00:19:29,278
Speaker 0: The only.

275
00:19:29,318 --> 00:19:31,810
Speaker 0: if you go to Astoria Park, there's plenty of tennis courts.

276
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,035
Speaker 0: They're rarely all full.

277
00:19:33,075 --> 00:19:39,661
Speaker 0: you could as wise you can just walk up and play on one of the empty ones and they only kick You out if when more people show up and it's full they kick out.

278
00:19:39,681 --> 00:19:40,283
Speaker 0: Whoever's been there?

279
00:19:40,303 --> 00:19:41,307
Speaker 0: the longest basically.

280
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:41,568
Speaker 0: That's the.

281
00:19:41,668 --> 00:19:42,270
Speaker 0: that's the system.

282
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:49,069
Speaker 0: Res pretty much reservations are for like the really popular ones like Central Park and whatnot where people are crowding up in there.

283
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:49,567
Speaker 1: They're more.

284
00:19:50,072 --> 00:19:54,270
Speaker 0: They're more if you go to go to the Bronx if you go up to like Crotona Park you play tennis all you want.

285
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:57,408
Speaker 1: Yeah, when I bike up in the Bronx, I see the courts all full all the time.

286
00:19:58,631 --> 00:19:59,514
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's popular.

287
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,440
Speaker 0: But you can absolutely play there.

288
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,584
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's empty courts.

289
00:20:02,644 --> 00:20:02,865
Speaker 1: Sure.

290
00:20:03,066 --> 00:20:04,230
Speaker 1: I'm saying I've looked into it.

291
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,849
Speaker 1: It's too much of a pain in the ass to be worth it.

292
00:20:06,231 --> 00:20:07,496
Speaker 1: The only good way to play ten.

293
00:20:07,516 --> 00:20:10,829
Speaker 0: the reason I don't play tennis is because I love hitting a ball back and forth.

294
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:12,034
Speaker 0: hitting a Back-and-forth is awesome.

295
00:20:12,074 --> 00:20:13,861
Speaker 0: I love hitting the ball back and forth the sport.

296
00:20:14,323 --> 00:20:15,930
Speaker 0: I don't like run back and forth the sport.

297
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,797
Speaker 0: So I'll stick to badminton.

298
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:20,347
Speaker 1: Well, if you don't like run back and forth just play ping-pong.

299
00:20:21,572 --> 00:20:21,975
Speaker 0: Pink feeling.

300
00:20:21,996 --> 00:20:23,045
Speaker 0: the problem is balls too small.

301
00:20:23,065 --> 00:20:23,509
Speaker 0: I can't hit it.

302
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,289
Speaker 1: It sounds like you just don't want to play a sport you're bad at.

303
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:30,900
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, it's like I don't play sports.

304
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,984
Speaker 0: It doesn't upset me.

305
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,370
Speaker 0: It doesn't upset me that I'm bad.

306
00:20:33,511 --> 00:20:34,381
Speaker 0: I don't expect to win it.

307
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,210
Speaker 0: badminton either.

308
00:20:35,712 --> 00:20:40,109
Speaker 0: It's that I will barely be playing because it'll be like someone serves and I can't return it.

309
00:20:40,834 --> 00:20:41,963
Speaker 0: I'm like, I'm not even playing.

310
00:20:42,003 --> 00:20:42,890
Speaker 0: I'm so bad, right?

311
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:47,850
Speaker 0: If I was a little bit better to where I could actually get a volley going and then get scored on I'd be okay.

312
00:20:48,031 --> 00:20:53,370
Speaker 1: I mean how you do that is you play you take lessons and then you just play again.

313
00:20:54,692 --> 00:20:55,276
Speaker 0: Let's not do that.

314
00:20:55,336 --> 00:21:00,248
Speaker 1: I spent 15 years playing tennis Actually seem worse Lee more than that.

315
00:21:00,691 --> 00:21:04,166
Speaker 1: But what I might do instead is just start playing racquetball or wall ball or something.

316
00:21:04,186 --> 00:21:10,108
Speaker 1: But anyway there is.

317
00:21:11,294 --> 00:21:15,868
Speaker 0: This is coming and we talked about it was happening for a while and then it happened.

318
00:21:15,949 --> 00:21:26,914
Speaker 1: effectively The US Supreme Court has for all intents and purposes overturned Roe vs Wade meaning that there is nothing preventing any state in America from just banning abortion Full stop.

319
00:21:26,934 --> 00:21:29,542
Speaker 0: Well, as long as they do it in a particular way.

320
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:40,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the way that Texas did it is so egregious and Violent that it's worth pointing out what this law does basically is it bans abortions after six weeks?

321
00:21:40,471 --> 00:21:43,781
Speaker 1: Which for all intents and purposes bans all abortion.

322
00:21:43,961 --> 00:21:46,569
Speaker 1: very few people even know they're pregnant at that point.

323
00:21:47,213 --> 00:21:47,837
Speaker 1: There's your body like.

324
00:21:47,857 --> 00:21:49,490
Speaker 1: there's no way to know unless you get a test.

325
00:21:49,751 --> 00:21:57,877
Speaker 1: You wouldn't think to get a test half the time and to the law says that anyone Literally anyone can sue.

326
00:21:58,058 --> 00:22:14,092
Speaker 1: I guess I guess anyone who's a citizen anyone in Texas can sue anyone who they suspect got an abortion and Get a $10,000 like bounty if in fact that person did get prosecuted for an abortion Mm-hmm.

327
00:22:14,655 --> 00:22:17,829
Speaker 1: That is fucked up like beyond belief.

328
00:22:18,931 --> 00:22:22,346
Speaker 0: Why can't we have bounties for other things right like?

329
00:22:22,647 --> 00:22:23,310
Speaker 1: I can tell you why?

330
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,924
Speaker 1: activation because if we did that for anything else the Supreme Court would strike it down.

331
00:22:26,944 --> 00:22:46,336
Speaker 1: the only reason they didn't strike this down is because The sole goal of a lot of people who push for Donald Trump and George Bush and Mitch McConnell Like a big part of why the Republican Party is in the position of power It's in is a dedicated group of people in America whose sole political issue is Banning women's health care.

332
00:22:46,557 --> 00:22:51,576
Speaker 1: they want to ban abortion and then if they are successful they want to ban birth control Like and they don't care what.

333
00:22:51,597 --> 00:22:54,330
Speaker 0: that's the only thing they care about literally they care about nothing else.

334
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,037
Speaker 0: They have like this single mindset.

335
00:22:56,057 --> 00:22:57,785
Speaker 0: So they'll vote for it for whoever will do that.

336
00:22:58,407 --> 00:23:01,521
Speaker 0: And so The you know, and it's a thing we don't want to do.

337
00:23:01,561 --> 00:23:06,062
Speaker 0: So we're not gonna do it to get their votes And the other people just want to win.

338
00:23:06,082 --> 00:23:08,595
Speaker 0: They don't care what they do They only care about winning.

339
00:23:08,756 --> 00:23:14,296
Speaker 0: So that's who they keep voting for and they don't care what other things those, you know People they voted for do so.

340
00:23:14,316 --> 00:23:40,542
Speaker 1: What's even worse the American anti-abortion movement that movement originally came out of and is primarily actually driven by anti-black racism because where that movement came from was a bunch of schools that excluded black students were basically told that they cannot maintain their charitable status as schools like they can't be a charity anymore unless they integrate.

341
00:23:41,144 --> 00:23:50,010
Speaker 1: and the movement that forms Focusing on abortion formed out of the resistance to integration in schools primarily religious schools.

342
00:23:50,776 --> 00:23:51,402
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's.

343
00:23:51,422 --> 00:23:55,681
Speaker 0: there's like 10 billion You know, we could go on for a hundred years talking about the history of.

344
00:23:55,962 --> 00:23:58,430
Speaker 0: you know, the abortion issue in the United States.

345
00:24:01,651 --> 00:24:05,683
Speaker 1: Abortion is a 100% human right and if you disagree with that, I'd rather you not.

346
00:24:05,703 --> 00:24:07,909
Speaker 0: it's not any different from any other medical procedure.

347
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:14,109
Speaker 0: It's only a special separate thing because some religious nutjobs decided to make it a special different thing for some.

348
00:24:14,129 --> 00:24:14,350
Speaker 0: you know.

349
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:18,343
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, but I guess it's like banning abortion isn't any.

350
00:24:18,464 --> 00:24:31,510
Speaker 1: it's like you might as well say Ben, you know Appendectomy, it's like yep, so To not focus on that but just focus on what this news means and what it is and you can go read more from experts.

351
00:24:31,591 --> 00:24:31,976
Speaker 1: But there's.

352
00:24:32,522 --> 00:24:33,109
Speaker 1: this is a lot.

353
00:24:33,452 --> 00:24:43,252
Speaker 1: a lot of really important things are gonna come out of this and you Have to internalize that things are gonna get way worse on this front before they because all the other shitty states are gonna do the Same thing.

354
00:24:43,352 --> 00:24:48,870
Speaker 1: pretty much everyone worse every Republican controlled state in America is gonna ban abortion in the coming few months.

355
00:24:49,292 --> 00:24:52,425
Speaker 0: And you have to realize, you know, it's like, you know, you're like, oh, okay.

356
00:24:52,445 --> 00:24:53,730
Speaker 0: Well, I don't care about those shitty states.

357
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:54,815
Speaker 0: I'll stay in my good state.

358
00:24:54,835 --> 00:24:57,930
Speaker 0: you realize the shitty states are mostly not shitty people.

359
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:01,204
Speaker 0: It's a minority of people in those states.

360
00:25:01,385 --> 00:25:02,350
Speaker 1: It's about half and half.

361
00:25:02,671 --> 00:25:07,830
Speaker 0: There are all of the red states also the majority of the people in those states, right?

362
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:09,898
Speaker 0: That's where most of the black people live.

363
00:25:09,918 --> 00:25:10,601
Speaker 0: Yep.

364
00:25:10,862 --> 00:25:12,590
Speaker 1: Well, so there's two kinds of red state.

365
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:30,326
Speaker 1: well, there's three kinds of red state but the two that matter for this conversation and this is something that a lot of Tech bro leftist progressives just erase or don't know or willfully ignore is that half of these red states are Almost entirely white and the far majority of the people there support a lot of what the public place

366
00:25:30,386 --> 00:25:31,971
Speaker 0: like like, Iowa Yeah,

367
00:25:32,071 --> 00:25:32,974
Speaker 1: or West Virginia.

368
00:25:32,994 --> 00:25:35,982
Speaker 1: West Virginia last I checked is like 94 percent white.

369
00:25:36,564 --> 00:25:47,043
Speaker 1: So the population there is low Yes but the other half of red states Wyoming are more like a 60/40 split like only 60% of the people there are vile monsters.

370
00:25:47,063 --> 00:25:49,230
Speaker 1: The other 40% are just trying to live their lives.

371
00:25:49,752 --> 00:25:59,861
Speaker 0: Well, it's not even that it's only in those days 60% of the voting people who aren't different because those states 60% of the people who successfully vote Yeah are vile monsters.

372
00:25:59,922 --> 00:26:05,307
Speaker 0: if you actually Had a vote of every person in the state and forced them to vote and so what kind of person they were?

373
00:26:05,327 --> 00:26:08,940
Speaker 0: a lot of Those states I think are probably actually not red

374
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:09,322
Speaker 1: because

375
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:15,882
Speaker 0: a lot of those dates gerrymandering Disenfranchisement, etc, etc, right, you know a lot

376
00:26:15,902 --> 00:26:28,187
Speaker 1: of those things have a very large non-white People that basically can't effectively vote because of voter restrictions that are only in place today Because the Supreme Court overturned the Voting Rights

377
00:26:28,288 --> 00:26:29,759
Speaker 0: Act anyway,

378
00:26:30,063 --> 00:26:32,899
Speaker 1: so Every red state is gonna ban abortion.

379
00:26:33,743 --> 00:26:35,670
Speaker 1: We can't stop it from blue states.

380
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:48,329
Speaker 1: There is literally no way to stop this legally other than the Congress packing the Supreme Court meaning appointing more justices so that then they can just rerule on this and ban this.

381
00:26:48,349 --> 00:26:58,303
Speaker 1: or Congress passing a law guaranteeing access to abortion which which probably they could do which Probably would be overturned by the compromise Supreme Court.

382
00:26:58,544 --> 00:26:59,709
Speaker 1: So we still have to pack the court.

383
00:27:00,492 --> 00:27:03,084
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, the problem is to pack the court.

384
00:27:03,586 --> 00:27:11,150
Speaker 1: we need either 50 Democratic senators willing to overturn the filibuster and a president willing to pack the court.

385
00:27:11,652 --> 00:27:25,770
Speaker 1: We have you don't need to overcome the filibuster to because when it comes to You know filling this note because it's not just it's not just a point It is you you actually change the size of the court via a congressional action and then on that.

386
00:27:25,931 --> 00:27:29,002
Speaker 0: So that action but actually appointing people you don't need to.

387
00:27:29,103 --> 00:27:41,808
Speaker 1: but the changing the size you would yeah You need either 60 senators to agree to effectively overturn the filibuster and agree to pack the court or You need 50 senators plus the president to agree to do it.

388
00:27:42,892 --> 00:27:52,590
Speaker 1: And we only have 50 Democratic senators at least two of which are evil vile people Sinema and Manchin who refuse to do anything on anything that matters to America.

389
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:58,994
Speaker 1: So as long as the Republicans are 100% opposed to this Democrats there is.

390
00:27:59,074 --> 00:28:06,009
Speaker 0: there is no way within the system of America following the rules That we can do it given the people that are there.

391
00:28:06,277 --> 00:28:18,908
Speaker 1: Yep Because to to fix voting rights so that the people who are disenfranchised in red states could vote You need those states to vote to remove the power of the people who currently control those states.

392
00:28:19,249 --> 00:28:19,650
Speaker 1: and guess what?

393
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:21,122
Speaker 1: Those people are gonna vote they're gonna vote.

394
00:28:21,142 --> 00:28:30,097
Speaker 0: No Mmm, this is the fundamental problem not just with America but with all systems on the entire Human society.

395
00:28:30,117 --> 00:28:33,010
Speaker 0: is that just about every system we have?

396
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:39,590
Speaker 0: Right puts the power to control the system in the hands of the people who are winning at the system.

397
00:28:40,111 --> 00:28:43,643
Speaker 0: Alright, so by winning you have the power to keep yourself winning.

398
00:28:43,924 --> 00:28:57,990
Speaker 0: whether it's voting money Business a board game, you know children's classroom games every single system on the whole face of the earth Most of the ones that are human society systems, right or even biological systems, you know.

399
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,094
Speaker 0: It's like if you're a virus.

400
00:28:59,134 --> 00:29:03,329
Speaker 0: that's you know, if you start winning then you have the power to.

401
00:29:03,429 --> 00:29:09,569
Speaker 0: you know Control the ecosystem to make yourself more winning the way humans well and then destroy it to make yourself losing.

402
00:29:11,212 --> 00:29:17,251
Speaker 0: But that's you know, we had to overcome that fundamental rule Systems.

403
00:29:17,853 --> 00:29:24,450
Speaker 0: Yeah to where the winners aren't the people who control the environment in which the winning and losing takes place.

404
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:29,309
Speaker 1: but that's it's actually a little subtly different here because what happens specifically in America?

405
00:29:29,349 --> 00:29:36,270
Speaker 1: because We have to marry that sort of theory with praxis and like the reality of a specific situation or there's no way to move forward.

406
00:29:36,895 --> 00:29:49,170
Speaker 1: There's a lot of great theories on how to fix this But the practical reality is that the problem literally comes down to the fact that American states Themselves get equal representation to each other despite having radically different populations.

407
00:29:50,131 --> 00:29:51,996
Speaker 1: Yep, that is the fundamental problem.

408
00:29:52,036 --> 00:29:58,960
Speaker 1: that literally prevents anything from being done about this and I think Non-legal action is what we need to do.

409
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:07,610
Speaker 1: races and I saw a couple other groups Starting to pledge that they're going to keep performing abortions in Texas and just they're gonna do civil disobedience.

410
00:30:08,534 --> 00:30:10,062
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's obviously a good idea.

411
00:30:10,082 --> 00:30:11,790
Speaker 1: That's might be the only path.

412
00:30:12,151 --> 00:30:20,202
Speaker 0: The other thing we can do is here's the thing is you're there even if you know Organizations weren't doing abortions in a civil disobedient.

413
00:30:20,242 --> 00:30:22,710
Speaker 0: Like we're doing abortions, right?

414
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:25,989
Speaker 0: We're sitting at the counter at Walgreens kind of way, right?

415
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:27,975
Speaker 0: Abortions are happening in Texas.

416
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:29,883
Speaker 0: No matter what the law is that would always have.

417
00:30:29,903 --> 00:30:31,570
Speaker 0: they would always continue to happen in Texas.

418
00:30:31,911 --> 00:30:33,716
Speaker 1: They happen whether

419
00:30:33,756 --> 00:30:40,860
Speaker 0: they're doctor Nick in the back room whether they're good doctor in the back room whether they're rich Person which right Republican

420
00:30:41,122 --> 00:30:41,846
Speaker 1: here's what's gonna have

421
00:30:41,946 --> 00:30:44,094
Speaker 0: it gets it done Anyway in secret rich

422
00:30:44,114 --> 00:30:50,473
Speaker 1: people in Texas even people who voted for this ban and wanted this ban will secretly get abortions in other states With their money.

423
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:51,957
Speaker 1: poor people are just fucked.

424
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,903
Speaker 0: or in Texas that you know, nothing's.

425
00:30:54,204 --> 00:30:54,846
Speaker 0: they're rich people.

426
00:30:54,947 --> 00:31:00,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, so At least one thing that has happened to and I want to point this out in the news.

427
00:31:00,931 --> 00:31:03,760
Speaker 1: So the Denver guys actually responded pretty quickly.

428
00:31:04,181 --> 00:31:06,007
Speaker 1: The house is gonna vote soon.

429
00:31:06,067 --> 00:31:07,110
Speaker 1: They already put together.

430
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,754
Speaker 1: They're finishing up a bill like as of today.

431
00:31:09,814 --> 00:31:18,323
Speaker 1: This is news that would guarantee abortion access nationally, of course The Senate won't pass it because the Senate is controlled by evil douchebags.

432
00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:20,489
Speaker 1: Nothing can pass the Senate right now literally nothing.

433
00:31:21,071 --> 00:31:25,927
Speaker 1: But the house remember Democrats only control the house by a couple seats.

434
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:32,010
Speaker 1: And yeah They're gonna vote on this bill Nancy Pelosi the speaker of the house.

435
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:39,053
Speaker 1: Basically the way American system work is the whoever controls these chamber has full authority to decide anything that even makes the floor in that Chamber.

436
00:31:39,518 --> 00:31:50,713
Speaker 1: so because also a problem Yeah, but so because Democrats control the house they can put legislation down But they probably often won't if they know it won't pass because that usually just hurts them Electorally.

437
00:31:51,155 --> 00:32:00,390
Speaker 1: the fact that Nancy Pelosi says they're gonna vote on this Like soon like this month as soon as possible to pass this bill means they have enough votes to pass it.

438
00:32:01,442 --> 00:32:14,326
Speaker 1: We know Pretty much every Republican is gonna vote against that meaning the Democrats in the US House Which represent a huge diverse chunk of America are in lockstep on this issue.

439
00:32:14,907 --> 00:32:15,990
Speaker 1: that is worth recognizing.

440
00:32:17,011 --> 00:32:22,430
Speaker 0: American Democrats have never been doesn't matter unless those two other people are in lockstep on the issue.

441
00:32:22,611 --> 00:32:23,394
Speaker 1: Oh, it seems like they are.

442
00:32:23,434 --> 00:32:25,903
Speaker 1: I'm saying that the yeah the other people in the Senate.

443
00:32:26,224 --> 00:32:30,322
Speaker 1: the problem with the Senate again Is that it doesn't actually represent the population.

444
00:32:30,342 --> 00:32:31,890
Speaker 0: we've said the same thing a thousand times.

445
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:38,599
Speaker 0: Yes, it you know say pointing out the problem that we all know doesn't fix the problem cuz I think there's literally no way to Legally fix the problem.

446
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,669
Speaker 1: I don't know what to do about it.

447
00:32:40,111 --> 00:32:43,025
Speaker 0: That's you said the same thing and we've all said the same thing for how many years?

448
00:32:43,065 --> 00:32:45,254
Speaker 1: alright, so then here's the question What do you do about this?

449
00:32:45,294 --> 00:32:47,924
Speaker 1: abortion is just gonna get banned in half this country, and there's nothing we can do I?

450
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:50,873
Speaker 0: Think that's you know you.

451
00:32:50,954 --> 00:32:59,312
Speaker 0: I think that the the the thing you have to come to terms with is that you know we're sit There's there's problems, and there's Consequences.

452
00:32:59,552 --> 00:33:04,026
Speaker 0: right it's like what we're seeing isn't like oh, we're losing the game.

453
00:33:04,126 --> 00:33:05,390
Speaker 0: We lost the game a long time ago.

454
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,293
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, right.

455
00:33:06,473 --> 00:33:08,038
Speaker 0: We've already lost your now.

456
00:33:08,058 --> 00:33:09,522
Speaker 0: We're just suffering the fight.

457
00:33:09,542 --> 00:33:15,928
Speaker 1: the final round of that game was when Al Gore Wrongly was not made president despite winning the popular vote.

458
00:33:16,932 --> 00:33:22,630
Speaker 0: All right, and it's like you know as long as the people who have the power aren't going to you know try.

459
00:33:22,771 --> 00:33:26,470
Speaker 0: It's like there is no within the system way.

460
00:33:26,872 --> 00:33:31,330
Speaker 0: So the question is are you willing to do an out-of-the-system way or not?

461
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:35,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, right and each person will do what they're gonna do and history is gonna history.

462
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,584
Speaker 1: Yeah, and what you can do in the show do so you.

463
00:33:37,645 --> 00:33:38,410
Speaker 0: so you you know.

464
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:42,570
Speaker 0: But you the only thing that you can control is what you do.

465
00:33:42,751 --> 00:33:43,153
Speaker 0: You're just.

466
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:45,930
Speaker 0: you know you're one person, and you know you can do something.

467
00:33:46,456 --> 00:33:47,911
Speaker 0: So you do what you're gonna Do.

468
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:48,934
Speaker 0: you're one person.

469
00:33:48,954 --> 00:33:49,536
Speaker 0: that is you.

470
00:33:49,556 --> 00:33:57,647
Speaker 0: yeah, maybe convince other people and then with a podcast or something like that Yeah, and then you see what happens and then one day you die.

471
00:33:57,667 --> 00:33:58,150
Speaker 1: yep.

472
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:05,163
Speaker 1: So what I would recommend you all do right now is the most immediate thing we have to deal with is the harm That's happening to people in Texas.

473
00:34:05,183 --> 00:34:11,630
Speaker 1: in these other states There are lots of charities that will help people get abortions if they need them and that is driving to another state.

474
00:34:11,771 --> 00:34:13,708
Speaker 0: You know do do what in the back?

475
00:34:14,251 --> 00:34:14,552
Speaker 0: Secret?

476
00:34:14,612 --> 00:34:18,764
Speaker 1: those are the organizations to donate to easy the speakeasy abortion.

477
00:34:18,784 --> 00:34:27,969
Speaker 1: you know what I'm saying is those are the organizations to donate to Now because the money you donate for political causes and other activism won't help those people for years.

478
00:34:28,413 --> 00:34:31,899
Speaker 1: So we got to focus on those people first mm-hmm.

479
00:34:33,233 --> 00:34:41,292
Speaker 1: So all I really have to say about that is I am definitely never setting foot in Texas again So long as all these laws are in place and if there's a bunch There's a lot.

480
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:45,630
Speaker 0: I mean I was already not too happy about how many times I did set foot in day.

481
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:48,679
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if there's a pack south this coming year.

482
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:51,370
Speaker 1: I will not be at it, but that's just one tiny thing.

483
00:34:51,952 --> 00:34:56,748
Speaker 0: I also think you know don't think they should have a pack south in Texas given this situation.

484
00:34:56,808 --> 00:34:59,609
Speaker 0: right given I was already a after the gun situation.

485
00:35:00,671 --> 00:35:10,201
Speaker 0: You know busy, Texas was already at don't forget the anti-transgender rights bill that they just passed and the answer Between the last pack south and now Texas went way over the line.

486
00:35:10,222 --> 00:35:16,348
Speaker 1: they passed over 600 individual Bills that restrict human rights in one way or another.

487
00:35:17,494 --> 00:35:19,970
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm like since the last time we were in Texas.

488
00:35:21,183 --> 00:35:21,328
Speaker 0: Yep.

489
00:35:22,511 --> 00:35:31,581
Speaker 0: So yeah, you know and I think we talked about how Major League Baseball moved over the voting thing moved the all-star game from you Know Atlanta to Colorado.

490
00:35:32,043 --> 00:35:33,650
Speaker 0: right, Texas is way worse.

491
00:35:33,852 --> 00:35:42,409
Speaker 0: I feel like we should pressure Not just you know packs and penny arcade which are close to us so we can pressure them I guess more because we're close to them at least in some way.

492
00:35:43,437 --> 00:35:46,875
Speaker 0: But we should pressure basically Every organization.

493
00:35:47,377 --> 00:35:55,475
Speaker 0: you know obviously not the ones that are like they're helping people right not those, but basically any capitalist Organization of any kind.

494
00:35:55,856 --> 00:35:59,228
Speaker 0: pressure them to fuck over, Texas as much as possible.

495
00:35:59,268 --> 00:36:05,232
Speaker 0: be like yeah You know and be like hey if you're gonna do business in the state of Texas Fuck you.

496
00:36:05,553 --> 00:36:08,101
Speaker 0: I also think we'll do anything to benefit that state.

497
00:36:08,161 --> 00:36:16,920
Speaker 0: bring that state down to you know ruin I think what would help there too, and I in a way that hurts in a way that hurts money Not a way that hurts the poor people living there.

498
00:36:17,081 --> 00:36:30,161
Speaker 1: so in terms of the latter part of that one angle we could take and I got to read more theory and like Read more from experienced activists to see if this would be helpful or not I think charities to help people who want to leave these states.

499
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:35,090
Speaker 1: leave them help them find like money and Resources to move get a job in a blue state.

500
00:36:35,992 --> 00:36:38,750
Speaker 1: I think that would one reduce the harm to the people who are trapped in these states.

501
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:40,129
Speaker 0: How about a purple state instead?

502
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:44,830
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I'm just well I said blue state first because I'm focusing more on their safety.

503
00:36:45,231 --> 00:36:46,195
Speaker 1: Then I'm just gonna fix this.

504
00:36:46,295 --> 00:36:57,350
Speaker 0: if we get all if all the good people of Texas move to like Ohio And to Ohio and Florida right take half the good people in Texas put them in, Ohio Take the other half put them in Florida problem solved.

505
00:36:58,231 --> 00:37:01,246
Speaker 1: That actually wouldn't get us enough Senate seats to pass the Voting Rights Act.

506
00:37:01,668 --> 00:37:02,130
Speaker 0: that would get us.

507
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,735
Speaker 1: So we get us four more.

508
00:37:04,076 --> 00:37:05,741
Speaker 1: we need a level.

509
00:37:05,781 --> 00:37:08,690
Speaker 1: actually we need 12 more to get past cinema and mansion.

510
00:37:09,471 --> 00:37:10,454
Speaker 0: No, we don't we just need.

511
00:37:10,474 --> 00:37:12,722
Speaker 0: if we get four more we can eliminate the filibuster.

512
00:37:12,782 --> 00:37:23,129
Speaker 1: and no because no no we can't necessarily Because there is a lot of evidence that there's a bunch of Democrats at least I've seen like real people who no more brothers than me say between four and twelve who?

513
00:37:23,853 --> 00:37:24,375
Speaker 1: Will not?

514
00:37:24,656 --> 00:37:27,007
Speaker 1: I will absolutely not get rid of the filibuster because they're.

515
00:37:27,067 --> 00:37:32,849
Speaker 1: even if those Mansion and cinema we could expose them by what you described, right?

516
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:33,713
Speaker 0: I don't know.

517
00:37:33,753 --> 00:37:37,550
Speaker 0: and once you knew who they were then if they're in blue states, then they can be outvoted.

518
00:37:37,952 --> 00:37:40,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, we can replace them with another right we can't replace.

519
00:37:40,521 --> 00:37:42,710
Speaker 0: You know mansion with it with a Democrat, right?

520
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:43,418
Speaker 0: He's gonna get replaced.

521
00:37:43,439 --> 00:37:44,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, that scene is lost.

522
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:48,149
Speaker 0: We have to pretend that's right to Republicans, but if it turns out that like, I don't know.

523
00:37:48,451 --> 00:37:49,559
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, what's?

524
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:50,910
Speaker 0: who's a good example, right?

525
00:37:51,191 --> 00:37:52,238
Speaker 0: I mean we should get rid of her.

526
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:59,936
Speaker 0: Anyway Feinstein in California Yeah, you know if she vote, you know, we can probably get rid of her if she votes Yeah, but then we run into stuff too.

527
00:37:59,996 --> 00:38:00,939
Speaker 1: Like, you know what?

528
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:04,450
Speaker 1: The primary thing is holding up Medicare for all the two Connecticut senators.

529
00:38:05,411 --> 00:38:06,194
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically.

530
00:38:06,334 --> 00:38:11,792
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're Democrats, but that state makes all its money from a corrupt industry Mm-hmm.

531
00:38:12,516 --> 00:38:18,770
Speaker 1: So yeah America is in super deep shit right now And this is gonna get way worse over the next couple years.

532
00:38:18,891 --> 00:38:22,997
Speaker 1: Like this issue is not going to get better anytime soon Prepare for the worst.

533
00:38:23,137 --> 00:38:23,660
Speaker 1: like I'm not.

534
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,810
Speaker 0: even the whole world is just getting worse, right?

535
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,476
Speaker 0: What place on earth is?

536
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:28,823
Speaker 0: are things on the upswing?

537
00:38:28,843 --> 00:38:37,876
Speaker 1: Uh Parts of Europe are doing better in a lot of ways Like where that's the best I can get.

538
00:38:38,257 --> 00:38:40,765
Speaker 1: honestly Germany is continuing to reach.

539
00:38:40,786 --> 00:38:42,110
Speaker 0: people on the beach are doing better.

540
00:38:42,271 --> 00:38:42,512
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

541
00:38:42,532 --> 00:38:43,677
Speaker 1: Yeah billionaires doing better.

542
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:46,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't get me started on wealth caps again.

543
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:52,254
Speaker 1: I think no human should have more than ten million dollars in assets, and I don't even think it should be like Oh, well tax you above that.

544
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:56,050
Speaker 1: I think it should be a felony to be caught having that many assets.

545
00:38:57,056 --> 00:38:57,750
Speaker 0: Sure, whatever.

546
00:38:58,535 --> 00:39:03,960
Speaker 1: anyway It's time for things of the day.

547
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:21,619
Speaker 1: So the other day I was in a private discord Looking to respond to someone with a meme because someone quoted the the transit Advisor from SimCity 2000 who is iconic if you've never seen this guy and I wanted to post a meme of that guy.

548
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,248
Speaker 1: So I looked for a SimCity 2000 like meme generator.

549
00:39:24,288 --> 00:39:24,649
Speaker 1: like you do.

550
00:39:25,392 --> 00:39:26,996
Speaker 1: That's way easier than photoshopping it.

551
00:39:27,036 --> 00:39:31,470
Speaker 1: someone did the work and what I discovered is a website called death generator calm.

552
00:39:32,535 --> 00:39:42,570
Speaker 1: It has like it has generators for So many old video games that it died about an hour and a half of just great fun using this thing last night.

553
00:39:43,033 --> 00:39:43,861
Speaker 0: And I did.

554
00:39:44,002 --> 00:39:44,204
Speaker 0: I did.

555
00:39:44,224 --> 00:39:44,869
Speaker 0: it was two nights ago.

556
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:45,968
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was two nights ago.

557
00:39:46,371 --> 00:39:56,056
Speaker 1: But this thing is super fun if you want to make like Oregon Trail or Legend of Zelda or Doug memes like This meme generator is just a plus.

558
00:39:56,136 --> 00:39:56,938
Speaker 1: It's well designed.

559
00:39:56,998 --> 00:39:57,640
Speaker 1: It's elegant.

560
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,687
Speaker 1: It just works props to at food.

561
00:40:01,048 --> 00:40:01,769
Speaker 1: who made this thing?

562
00:40:02,554 --> 00:40:04,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, what a horrible night to have a meme generator.

563
00:40:06,352 --> 00:40:11,190
Speaker 1: Are you a bad enough dude to post topical appropriate memes and their respective channels?

564
00:40:12,891 --> 00:40:19,610
Speaker 0: Are you a bad enough dude to go from a serious topic about the you know end of human society to then talking about video game memes?

565
00:40:20,192 --> 00:40:27,600
Speaker 1: Ah, but I uh, if there's one thing that keeps me sane throughout the hellscape of my adult life It is the fact that I have computer still works.

566
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:30,050
Speaker 0: You have your you have your foot bread and your circus.

567
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:30,511
Speaker 0: It's it.

568
00:40:30,672 --> 00:40:31,314
Speaker 1: I have my bread.

569
00:40:31,374 --> 00:40:38,202
Speaker 1: I have my circus but more importantly I have a very dark sense of humor that That's not even festival from hell world.

570
00:40:38,242 --> 00:40:39,550
Speaker 0: That's for when I was a target to help you.

571
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:41,476
Speaker 0: You got a scary clown circus.

572
00:40:41,497 --> 00:40:45,450
Speaker 1: not a fun clown circus, yeah, but I go to the scary clown circus and I'm kind of into it.

573
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:46,133
Speaker 1: That's the difference.

574
00:40:47,137 --> 00:40:48,341
Speaker 0: I like the good clown circus.

575
00:40:48,482 --> 00:40:48,944
Speaker 1: I like both.

576
00:40:49,004 --> 00:40:50,410
Speaker 0: I like both scared of clowns.

577
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:57,856
Speaker 0: I like both happy clown and terrifying clown equally and as long as the clown is here for me It's all about where the clown is talented.

578
00:40:57,896 --> 00:41:01,370
Speaker 0: right an untalented clown is sort of just really sad and disappointing.

579
00:41:01,451 --> 00:41:03,690
Speaker 0: But a really talented clown is like whoa, right?

580
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:16,050
Speaker 1: They've got the juggling and their magic And unchallenged clown is actually scarier than a scary clown because an untalented clown is Someone whose life is probably also very sad and you can feel that sadness.

581
00:41:16,392 --> 00:41:17,640
Speaker 0: They got the mime skills.

582
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,270
Speaker 0: a clown just got so many skills, right?

583
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:22,730
Speaker 0: You look at someone like, you know, Charlie Chaplin with like all the physical humor.

584
00:41:22,811 --> 00:41:23,213
Speaker 0: That's like a -.

585
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:25,045
Speaker 0: that's what a talented clown is right.

586
00:41:25,307 --> 00:41:25,810
Speaker 0: only live.

587
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:29,480
Speaker 1: All I get it now is that that tweet from space twigs doctor.

588
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:30,604
Speaker 1: The treatment is simple.

589
00:41:31,045 --> 00:41:31,927
Speaker 1: go see Orville.

590
00:41:31,987 --> 00:41:33,832
Speaker 1: very funny clown Pagliacci.

591
00:41:33,892 --> 00:41:39,428
Speaker 1: what about Pagliacci doctor Pagliacci, man, I could not name a more suck-ass clown.

592
00:41:39,749 --> 00:41:47,335
Speaker 0: just Haven't heard that one.

593
00:41:47,355 --> 00:41:47,917
Speaker 0: Oh, that's a good.

594
00:41:47,958 --> 00:41:50,410
Speaker 0: That's a good Pagliacci remix if I ever heard.

595
00:41:54,390 --> 00:42:03,532
Speaker 0: Okay, so one thing a clown might do is jump rope, I'm actually becoming a fan of jump rope lately Cardio.

596
00:42:03,612 --> 00:42:04,738
Speaker 1: like you think running's hard.

597
00:42:04,959 --> 00:42:06,948
Speaker 1: try jump roping at speed for ten minutes.

598
00:42:06,988 --> 00:42:08,034
Speaker 0: Good God I can't even.

599
00:42:08,135 --> 00:42:09,605
Speaker 0: I couldn't even jump rope for five minutes.

600
00:42:09,686 --> 00:42:14,866
Speaker 0: So Yeah, jump ropes are real cheap - I got one for a few bucks, right?

601
00:42:14,967 --> 00:42:16,921
Speaker 0: And it's just like yeah It's other than biking.

602
00:42:16,961 --> 00:42:21,970
Speaker 0: jump roping is fun Yeah, you know and you can exercise and fun or even a fake jump rope with this.

603
00:42:22,151 --> 00:42:23,219
Speaker 0: There's that app on the switch.

604
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:27,399
Speaker 0: You can just fake jump rope with two Two joy cons with no string.

605
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:29,385
Speaker 0: jump roping is getting a whole body workout.

606
00:42:29,445 --> 00:42:30,027
Speaker 1: And it's also.

607
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:31,845
Speaker 1: it's difficult It's not easy to do.

608
00:42:31,886 --> 00:42:34,962
Speaker 0: Well Yeah, you'll I mean I can do it.

609
00:42:35,002 --> 00:42:38,204
Speaker 0: I just can't do it super well But you get but you get better very quickly with.

610
00:42:38,224 --> 00:42:42,930
Speaker 0: so it's a weird aside But it's not like ping-pong where you try a hundred times and you still can't you know, even get it.

611
00:42:44,294 --> 00:42:55,068
Speaker 1: In my elementary and middle schools on the playground we would often get engaged in jump rope offs and the way they would work is two people start jump roping and Basically, whoever can go the longest wins.

612
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:59,094
Speaker 0: That was it We would do the.

613
00:42:59,155 --> 00:43:02,029
Speaker 0: you know, we would do the three people write two people on the ends hold the big one.

614
00:43:02,551 --> 00:43:08,450
Speaker 0: You know whenever that happened usually the turn turning around, you know doing it, you know, I could do a flip.

615
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:11,000
Speaker 1: It's what you were doing more freestyle and we were doing technical.

616
00:43:11,241 --> 00:43:18,250
Speaker 0: some people could you know do the switch feet like left right left Right, some people would do like jump once but make the rope go under them like three times before they land.

617
00:43:19,173 --> 00:43:21,452
Speaker 0: I could do it two times before I land but not three time I could.

618
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:24,666
Speaker 1: I never successfully did the two jump ropes at the same time ever.

619
00:43:24,807 --> 00:43:27,319
Speaker 1: I fell on my face 100% of the times I tried that.

620
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:28,304
Speaker 0: Oh the double dutch.

621
00:43:28,324 --> 00:43:28,786
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can't do.

622
00:43:28,847 --> 00:43:29,490
Speaker 1: I can't do it at all.

623
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:36,010
Speaker 0: I just but here in this thing of the day They're doing a shocking number of jump ropes at the same time.

624
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:42,588
Speaker 0: In fact, it is a dangerous number of jump ropes at the same time so dangerous that there are two spotters Watching the person jumping.

625
00:43:43,972 --> 00:43:46,286
Speaker 0: I don't even understand really how this works.

626
00:43:46,346 --> 00:43:46,910
Speaker 0: Is this fake?

627
00:43:47,952 --> 00:43:50,866
Speaker 0: I don't know what it is, but it's worth looking at and that's why it's a thing of the day.

628
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:58,385
Speaker 1: So the top posts under this are that would fuck you up if you miss the jump the next place.

629
00:43:58,425 --> 00:44:00,010
Speaker 0: it would instant bondage.

630
00:44:01,034 --> 00:44:05,422
Speaker 1: Yes, it would Imagine failing a jump and being strangled right there in front of.

631
00:44:05,482 --> 00:44:07,350
Speaker 0: how do they even make the ropes for this fucking thing?

632
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:14,270
Speaker 1: Imagine failing a jump and being just strangled there right in front of everyone by everyone.

633
00:44:14,772 --> 00:44:17,261
Speaker 0: Well, that's what it's two people to Russian and save you just standing there.

634
00:44:17,442 --> 00:44:19,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, I hope those two people have knives on them.

635
00:44:20,432 --> 00:44:21,239
Speaker 0: I think they probably.

636
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:28,130
Speaker 0: I assume they do otherwise But you never know cuz this is like how I think really the impact of getting hit is really what's gonna mess you up?

637
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:33,857
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, especially cuz those jump ropes are so long And there's so many of them right?

638
00:44:33,897 --> 00:44:35,826
Speaker 0: It's like imagine you get whipped by one whip.

639
00:44:35,846 --> 00:44:36,790
Speaker 0: It's like ow, right?

640
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:41,130
Speaker 0: You know if it's and these aren't getting whipped hard like someone's trying to you know, give you lashes, right?

641
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:43,177
Speaker 0: They're just sort of going a little bit but it.

642
00:44:43,197 --> 00:44:50,190
Speaker 0: so it's sort of like a weak whip but a weak whip times that many Right plus the leverage of a long rope.

643
00:44:52,173 --> 00:44:57,150
Speaker 0: You know, there's a lot of leverage in there in give me a rope long enough and I'll move something.

644
00:44:57,371 --> 00:45:02,465
Speaker 1: Yeah, so in the better moment, we will not be at PAX West which is ongoing this weekend.

645
00:45:02,505 --> 00:45:06,130
Speaker 1: This is the first PAX Anywhere in the United States?

646
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:09,258
Speaker 1: We have not been to and presented at.

647
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,051
Speaker 1: says it's happening physically since we started in 2008.

648
00:45:13,051 --> 00:45:14,990
Speaker 1: We've also presented at every virtual packs.

649
00:45:15,841 --> 00:45:19,761
Speaker 1: So Thus ends the streak officially as of today.

650
00:45:19,781 --> 00:45:22,190
Speaker 0: It's an arbitrary streak.

651
00:45:23,652 --> 00:45:28,510
Speaker 0: No, my health is more important than and even if the streak was a meaningful thing and not an arbitrary thing.

652
00:45:28,671 --> 00:45:29,594
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, no regrets.

653
00:45:29,655 --> 00:45:32,225
Speaker 0: It is more important by like a billion.

654
00:45:32,285 --> 00:45:33,410
Speaker 1: Don't get me wrong though.

655
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:39,130
Speaker 1: I broke the streak a year after you really when we didn't keep going to PAX Australia every year because I had ridiculous.

656
00:45:39,991 --> 00:45:40,232
Speaker 0: I have.

657
00:45:40,293 --> 00:45:43,425
Speaker 0: no I have like, you know, you think oh you have this big long streak.

658
00:45:43,445 --> 00:45:44,810
Speaker 0: you think I'd be like upset about it.

659
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:45,038
Speaker 0: It's like.

660
00:45:45,059 --> 00:45:49,662
Speaker 1: no I had a streak of over a decade.

661
00:45:49,702 --> 00:45:52,650
Speaker 1: go to Wildwood every year and I broke that streak for good reasons.

662
00:45:53,451 --> 00:45:58,248
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just you know, it's like, you know, it's not a big deal arbitrary numbers and things don't mean any.

663
00:45:58,269 --> 00:45:58,509
Speaker 0: you know.

664
00:45:58,730 --> 00:45:58,931
Speaker 0: It's like.

665
00:45:58,951 --> 00:46:01,341
Speaker 0: what means something, you know, it means something being healthy.

666
00:46:01,683 --> 00:46:05,870
Speaker 0: No one that I know and care about I mean some people I know and care about got COVID, right?

667
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:14,316
Speaker 0: But you know for the most part the damage that I and people I care about have suffered has been way less than what other People have done for which I'm thankful.

668
00:46:14,798 --> 00:46:17,407
Speaker 0: I'll give up fucking PAX forever in exchange for that.

669
00:46:17,507 --> 00:46:18,309
Speaker 0: So I don't give a shit.

670
00:46:18,932 --> 00:46:28,204
Speaker 1: Yep, our last PAX panel, which was a PAX East Online 2021 Camp PAX Atari game design is just on YouTube slides and notes.

671
00:46:28,425 --> 00:46:29,267
Speaker 1: Everything is just there.

672
00:46:29,307 --> 00:46:29,910
Speaker 1: You can just watch it.

673
00:46:30,272 --> 00:46:31,966
Speaker 1: You don't have to wait for PAX to post a VOD or whatever.

674
00:46:31,986 --> 00:46:32,309
Speaker 1: They're gonna do.

675
00:46:33,451 --> 00:46:34,917
Speaker 1: Book Club book is still the tale of Genji.

676
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:44,530
Speaker 1: I haven't read any since the last show we did but that was only two days ago, so hey, but uh, I think definitely gonna finish it within a month or two because I'm steamrolling along.

677
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:46,930
Speaker 0: and Well, I guess I guess I'll start reading.

678
00:46:47,051 --> 00:46:54,650
Speaker 0: I think the thing the thing that's actually motivating me is like there's these other books I've discovered that I want to read but I feel guilty reading a book that's not good.

679
00:46:54,751 --> 00:46:56,949
Speaker 1: Oh the book I picked for the next book is you pick Genji.

680
00:46:57,952 --> 00:47:01,369
Speaker 0: I know the book you pick for the next book is a book that I very badly want to.

681
00:47:01,409 --> 00:47:08,530
Speaker 0: yes Wait, I wanted to wait to read it until it's series that it is in is completely done.

682
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:10,063
Speaker 0: No, I'm just gonna be the boys.

683
00:47:10,084 --> 00:47:10,709
Speaker 0: You know, I hate.

684
00:47:11,571 --> 00:47:16,989
Speaker 1: Yeah, though if you the thing is this author we know we'll finish what they start quickly.

685
00:47:17,431 --> 00:47:20,159
Speaker 0: Well, oh, yeah, and he will end in our you know, hopefully right?

686
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:22,125
Speaker 0: Well, we are Scott backer.

687
00:47:22,426 --> 00:47:23,610
Speaker 1: Well, what's going on, buddy?

688
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:25,435
Speaker 1: Nothing ever come on, buddy.

689
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:26,460
Speaker 0: I assume it's done.

690
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,224
Speaker 0: I assume that's it.

691
00:47:27,304 --> 00:47:29,396
Speaker 0: We're not getting anymore buddy You got it.

692

Speaker 1: you got to explain.

694
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:33,358
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm a piece of the fact we're not getting any.

695
00:47:33,458 --> 00:47:38,421
Speaker 1: I am confident that Cal moments with a C and Cal moments with a K. that is not a coincidence.

696
00:47:38,662 --> 00:47:45,670
Speaker 1: I'm gonna die on that hill and The only way you can prove me wrong is to publish a goddamn book or I guess come on the show and tell us what?

697
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:46,737
Speaker 1: The ending was gonna be otherwise.

698
00:47:47,059 --> 00:47:52,787
Speaker 0: while we're talking about books just real quick I want to call out the shenanigans that Amazon is doing, you know, they're doing lots of shenanigans.

00:47:52,968 --> 00:48:01,922

00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:22,570
Speaker 1: That's like the Sunday super shopper special, right?

708
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:26,025
Speaker 0: But it's like specifically for you because it was on your wish list.

709
00:48:26,226 --> 00:48:28,077
Speaker 0: in seven days You have to and it's like.

710
00:48:28,178 --> 00:48:28,681
Speaker 0: it's like fuck.

711
00:48:28,762 --> 00:48:29,789
Speaker 0: I do want to read that book.

712
00:48:30,211 --> 00:48:32,138
Speaker 0: I'm gonna read it one day or at least I think I am.

713
00:48:32,761 --> 00:48:33,845
Speaker 0: if I don't buy it now.

714
00:48:34,166 --> 00:48:35,250
Speaker 0: I'm losing five bucks.

715
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:37,210
Speaker 0: I'm just giving Jeff Bezos five.

716
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:41,487
Speaker 1: Don't buy now don't buy something unless you're imminently about to use it.

717
00:48:42,231 --> 00:48:45,830
Speaker 0: That's of course my policy and that is of course why I'm not buying it.

718
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:47,560
Speaker 0: But that's an evil.

719
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:56,146
Speaker 0: whoever came up with that evil dirty trick I got a guess at Amazon that person probably got promoted like ten times for that trick And that trick should be illegal.

720
00:48:56,227 --> 00:49:02,150
Speaker 1: also My guess is that someone in Amazon just took some training on modern pricing methodologies.

721
00:49:02,792 --> 00:49:07,650
Speaker 0: Whoever I'm saying whoever implemented that system that does that should go to jail and it should be illegal.

722
00:49:08,091 --> 00:49:11,885
Speaker 1: That doesn't bother me nearly as much as gacha mechanics in games and pay-to-win.

723
00:49:12,467 --> 00:49:13,310
Speaker 0: I'm just saying is bad.

724
00:49:14,652 --> 00:49:18,890
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm more mad that Pokemon unite is a terrible game because of pay-to-win than I am about that.

725
00:49:19,933 --> 00:49:20,701
Speaker 0: I'm listening.

726
00:49:20,722 --> 00:49:26,930
Speaker 1: It's just another thing In the world someday, we'll get power and we'll break Amazon into a million pieces.

727
00:49:27,872 --> 00:49:28,315
Speaker 0: What the book?

728
00:49:28,395 --> 00:49:29,120
Speaker 0: one will still be doing?

729
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,610
Speaker 0: the evil shit the book company.

730
00:49:30,831 --> 00:49:32,800
Speaker 1: But if they were just a book company, they would.

731
00:49:33,101 --> 00:49:36,027
Speaker 1: the other book companies could compete with them maybe.

732
00:49:37,373 --> 00:49:38,343
Speaker 1: Well, we could probably see.

733
00:49:38,383 --> 00:49:38,969
Speaker 1: here's the other thing.

734
00:49:39,371 --> 00:49:44,570
Speaker 1: Remember my my praxis and I haven't talked to this a lot on geek nights, but I'm not gonna derail this.

735
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:49,962
Speaker 1: we're getting right into the main bed, but Here my main thing is we can't just become communists like.

736
00:49:49,982 --> 00:49:52,430
Speaker 1: there's no non-violent way to make that just happen.

737
00:49:52,551 --> 00:49:53,597
Speaker 1: I mean as much as I want that.

738
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:57,416
Speaker 1: the pragmatic for approach is You make public options.

739
00:49:57,497 --> 00:50:04,743
Speaker 1: you start with things that make a lot of sense to a lot of people like oh, yeah Public utility public health care, whatever, but then you start edging into.

740
00:50:05,125 --> 00:50:06,550
Speaker 1: there's the government game company.

741
00:50:06,952 --> 00:50:11,214
Speaker 1: There's the government silverware company government streaming service Free markets.

742
00:50:11,335 --> 00:50:14,447
Speaker 0: welcome to compete with that government option have a government streaming service.

743
00:50:14,468 --> 00:50:15,050
Speaker 0: It's called library.

744
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:24,190
Speaker 0: That doesn't let you that doesn't stream you on a public platform that the library There are the library has like a thing that you can log into and watch a fucking ton of movies.

745
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:30,264
Speaker 1: No, no, I'm talking publishing streams not in this case Me making a stream out to the world.

746
00:50:30,385 --> 00:50:31,833
Speaker 0: Oh, I Was.

747
00:50:31,893 --> 00:50:32,918
Speaker 1: that was what I was referring to?

748
00:50:32,978 --> 00:50:35,469
Speaker 1: Otherwise, yes, you were correct if you think about the opposite end of that.

749
00:50:35,977 --> 00:50:38,790
Speaker 1: But yeah If thanks, there should be a public out the public bookstore.

750
00:50:39,192 --> 00:50:40,638
Speaker 1: Amazon has to compete with the government.

751
00:50:40,718 --> 00:50:42,064
Speaker 1: one and guess what the government won't.

752
00:50:42,085 --> 00:50:46,004
Speaker 1: let you say our books are free We just pay the authors and we give the books away for free.

753
00:50:46,226 --> 00:50:46,990
Speaker 1: Fuck you Amazon.

754
00:50:48,072 --> 00:50:49,470
Speaker 1: That's how you get to communism.

755
00:50:50,591 --> 00:50:57,870
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway Genji continues to have no job other than sleeping with ladies after telling them poetry.

756
00:50:58,572 --> 00:50:59,936
Speaker 0: What a job though.

757
00:51:00,437 --> 00:51:24,670
Speaker 1: of everything I've read up to this point the funniest moment still is from Moderates like it's still in the first third of the book But it just stands out of the moment when he's trying to woo that one woman and he's incognito and then he sees someone else in the area who's also incognito and he Realizes that that dude is trying to woo the same woman and then they bump into each other and they're both like what the fuck?

758
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:25,176
Speaker 1: Are you doing?

759
00:51:25,216 --> 00:51:26,210
Speaker 1: what the fuck are you doing?

760
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:33,513
Speaker 1: Nobody can see either of us here and they sneak back into the court and pretend they'd been there the whole time Mm-hmm.

761
00:51:33,774 --> 00:51:36,049
Speaker 1: I think that's the funniest thing that's happened in the book so far.

762
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:38,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not exactly a comedy.

763
00:51:38,481 --> 00:51:40,089
Speaker 1: Yeah, but funny things like that happen.

764
00:51:41,034 --> 00:51:44,710
Speaker 1: So Outerwear, I heard you had some trouble with your rain jacket yesterday.

765
00:51:45,291 --> 00:51:49,127
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, so my strategy because I was going to the tennis and didn't know the situation there.

766
00:51:49,589 --> 00:51:51,016
Speaker 0: apparently You know, I could have.

767
00:51:51,177 --> 00:51:55,501
Speaker 0: just you know, I was like, well, let's not bring any bags Let's not even bring a camera with a big lens.

768
00:51:55,541 --> 00:51:57,350
Speaker 0: Who knows what they're gonna let me do, right?

769
00:51:57,771 --> 00:51:59,864
Speaker 0: Let's go with as minimal things as possible.

770
00:51:59,885 --> 00:52:05,610
Speaker 0: I know it's gonna rain Yeah, but I'm not gonna bring an umbrella because I know you're usually not allowed to open it at the tennis because it blocks people's.

771
00:52:07,231 --> 00:52:08,318
Speaker 0: Let's not even bring umbrellas.

772
00:52:08,359 --> 00:52:09,889
Speaker 0: Let's just wear our raincoats.

773
00:52:10,371 --> 00:52:12,339
Speaker 0: They'll keep us dry if we get rained on.

774
00:52:12,419 --> 00:52:13,705
Speaker 0: well, we don't have anything on us.

775
00:52:13,745 --> 00:52:14,950
Speaker 0: So who gives a shit if we get wet?

776
00:52:15,171 --> 00:52:15,392
Speaker 0: Right.

777
00:52:15,412 --> 00:52:15,733
Speaker 0: We'll just.

778
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:22,850
Speaker 0: we'll just walk home wet and then change we get home And well, you know in a raincoat will keep us dry enough that it won't be intolerable.

779
00:52:24,831 --> 00:52:30,949
Speaker 0: So my raincoat that I wore was basically, you know this $20 effectively sheet of plastic.

780
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:36,110
Speaker 0: ish It's like a synthetic cloth and inside the synthetic cloth is basically like a rubbery coating.

781
00:52:36,673 --> 00:52:37,718
Speaker 0: You know, I got a Uniqlo for like 20.

782
00:52:37,718 --> 00:52:43,256
Speaker 1: so I have one question for you is it slightly stretchy Or is it completely rigid?

783
00:52:43,276 --> 00:52:44,883
Speaker 1: Can you stretch it a little or not at all?

784
00:52:44,903 --> 00:52:47,294
Speaker 0: I Don't know I had to go.

785
00:52:47,314 --> 00:52:48,118
Speaker 0: I'm just curious.

786
00:52:48,158 --> 00:52:50,649
Speaker 1: go look is that sounds like cheapo soft shell?

787
00:52:51,631 --> 00:52:58,230
Speaker 0: So, you know, we went to the tennis and surprisingly didn't get really wet at the tennis And then we went out to eat dinner with some friends, right?

788
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:02,890
Speaker 0: We got a little bit rain on the way when we were walking to the food place to the restaurant.

789
00:53:03,192 --> 00:53:05,590
Speaker 0: But you know, it was fine walking into the restaurant.

790
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:12,950
Speaker 0: But when we were at the restaurant outdoor dining, but with a roof over us right to keep us dry, but still outdoors It was so, you know acceptable.

791
00:53:13,912 --> 00:53:15,229
Speaker 0: That's when the big rain came.

792
00:53:16,531 --> 00:53:20,990
Speaker 0: And you know, we waited to leave the restaurant until the raid died down a little bit and then we left.

793
00:53:21,432 --> 00:53:25,273
Speaker 0: But of course on the walk the rain picked up Came down.

794
00:53:25,313 --> 00:53:28,102
Speaker 0: We basically got completely soaked and my shoes are completely soaked.

795
00:53:28,403 --> 00:53:31,255
Speaker 0: I expected that I knew that was gonna happen Short-soaked.

796
00:53:31,476 --> 00:53:33,005
Speaker 0: I expected that before I left the house.

797
00:53:33,065 --> 00:53:33,849
Speaker 0: I was okay with that.

798
00:53:34,433 --> 00:53:36,867
Speaker 0: You know, it's just fine with all those situations.

799
00:53:37,229 --> 00:53:49,609
Speaker 0: but while I'm walking My shirt not that not the raincoat thing the shirt that was completely covered by the raincoat I felt water going down my back and I'm like how the fuck is this water getting in there?

800
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:50,631
Speaker 0: Right.

801
00:53:50,832 --> 00:53:53,010
Speaker 0: Yeah water has gotten in there all I've been in the ring already.

802
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:55,299
Speaker 1: The answer is from the very beginning when you said that.

803
00:53:55,601 --> 00:53:57,629
Speaker 1: when you said the words, I'm gonna quote you.

804
00:54:00,013 --> 00:54:03,656
Speaker 0: Yeah Somehow my shirt was getting wet.

805
00:54:03,797 --> 00:54:05,402
Speaker 0: even you know, it didn't it?

806
00:54:05,803 --> 00:54:10,219
Speaker 0: this thing kept me dry for quite a while But not forever.

807
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:12,050
Speaker 0: eventually I was getting wet.

808
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:15,381
Speaker 0: So what happened is when I got onto the train.

809
00:54:15,462 --> 00:54:20,964
Speaker 0: finally when we were nice and dry on the subway train I Realized hey because it's a blue.

810
00:54:21,044 --> 00:54:21,689
Speaker 0: It's a blue coat.

811
00:54:22,352 --> 00:54:26,029
Speaker 0: There were like these blue specks on my hands and I'm like, what the fuck is this?

812
00:54:26,551 --> 00:54:32,130
Speaker 0: Thing was like fucking disintegrating from like the inside into little bits and then the water was getting through.

813
00:54:32,632 --> 00:54:34,279
Speaker 0: I was like this thing is totally shot.

814
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:35,123
Speaker 0: I just got to throw it out.

815
00:54:35,163 --> 00:54:35,866
Speaker 0: It's useless now.

816
00:54:36,348 --> 00:54:39,334
Speaker 1: Yeah Like it sucks that.

817
00:54:39,374 --> 00:54:40,738
Speaker 1: the reality of the world is this.

818
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:50,307
Speaker 1: but especially with outerwear like sports outerwear or weather protection outerwear The more expensive ones are better but not just are they better up to a certain point.

819
00:54:50,367 --> 00:55:03,110
Speaker 1: up to a certain point obviously but they are better to a Shocking degree like So for example, I I wear like a couple hundred dollars ski jacket a hard shell like serious a normal price.

820
00:55:03,492 --> 00:55:04,556
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is not.

821
00:55:04,596 --> 00:55:05,942
Speaker 1: it's not waterproof at all.

822
00:55:05,982 --> 00:55:07,890
Speaker 1: You want an actual waterproof ski jacket.

823
00:55:08,091 --> 00:55:12,930
Speaker 1: You're spending middle 500 plus now 800 just for the top and it's uninsulated.

824
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:17,329
Speaker 1: Then you have to buy all the other layers separately and then buy the bib and the overall separately as well.

825
00:55:18,712 --> 00:55:27,262
Speaker 1: it's like the Gulf between pretty good and Actually, like fully good is so wide with this kind of stuff.

826
00:55:27,523 --> 00:55:28,807
Speaker 0: Well also what's you know?

827
00:55:28,927 --> 00:55:31,510
Speaker 0: good it's you know Good enough right for what you're doing.

828
00:55:32,452 --> 00:55:39,750
Speaker 0: It's like you can pay for more and more levels But really the $200 level for walking around is gonna be perfect for anybody.

829
00:55:39,856 --> 00:55:41,375
Speaker 1: Yeah But like for skiing.

830
00:55:41,516 --> 00:55:44,770
Speaker 1: if you're skiing like a lot or doing like out like backcountry skiing.

831
00:55:45,251 --> 00:55:51,008
Speaker 1: That's $200 is not good enough because it's dangerous to use something so weak compared to a quote.

832
00:55:51,068 --> 00:55:51,710
Speaker 1: real solution.

833
00:55:52,131 --> 00:55:56,204
Speaker 0: So yeah, it really depends on the more you pay the more you pay right you get.

834
00:55:56,586 --> 00:55:59,545
Speaker 0: a you're warmer Yeah, B your dryer.

835
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:07,618
Speaker 0: Yeah C you're gonna be less like sweaty and shit cuz you're gonna get like some nice, you know, like Breathe more.

836
00:56:07,759 --> 00:56:08,868
Speaker 1: it's like design better.

837
00:56:09,262 --> 00:56:09,811
Speaker 0: Yeah It's breathe.

838
00:56:09,852 --> 00:56:12,100
Speaker 0: it breathes better or wicks or who knows what it's.

839
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:14,930
Speaker 1: usually but not always it'll last longer because I can talk about.

840
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:17,410
Speaker 1: one Of the jacket I own is extremely expensive.

841
00:56:17,734 --> 00:56:24,410
Speaker 1: It's also extremely fragile But it serves a very different use case because it weighs nothing and I can get arrested.

842
00:56:24,611 --> 00:56:27,948
Speaker 1: I can compress it into a ball about the size and shape of my cell phone.

843
00:56:28,712 --> 00:56:31,162
Speaker 0: Yeah, when you pay more you're getting more durability, right?

844
00:56:31,182 --> 00:56:32,026
Speaker 0: You're getting more comfort.

845
00:56:32,066 --> 00:56:35,977
Speaker 0: You're getting better Design, it looks cooler right more fashion.

846
00:56:36,438 --> 00:56:40,450
Speaker 0: You're getting you know possible, you know crumple ability like rim just said.

847
00:56:40,832 --> 00:56:42,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're also getting lighter, right?

848
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:47,150
Speaker 0: It's like you could pay, you know, like get a really warm coat that for really cheap.

849
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:51,929
Speaker 0: That's gonna keep you nice and toasty all winter and but it'll be like big puffy boy like poof poof.

850
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:56,343
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can also get something that's like ultra thin and weighs nothing.

851
00:56:56,845 --> 00:57:07,265
Speaker 0: It feels like I'm wearing nothing at all But somehow it's keeping you warm like it's a big puffy coat or a blanket.

852
00:57:07,285 --> 00:57:08,349
Speaker 0: like how the hell is it doing?

853
00:57:08,369 --> 00:57:10,053
Speaker 0: well they They Filled it with u.s.

854
00:57:10,073 --> 00:57:10,996
Speaker 0: Dollars, that's what's happening.

855
00:57:11,017 --> 00:57:11,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.

856
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:16,530
Speaker 0: You're insulating with with pictures of dead.

857
00:57:16,919 --> 00:57:21,088
Speaker 1: the listener chimed in like Scott strikes me as a raincoat kind of guy which is true.

858
00:57:21,169 --> 00:57:28,136
Speaker 1: cuz what my first reaction when you said oh, I got wet my raincoat is that I Personally hate raincoats.

859
00:57:28,156 --> 00:57:31,570
Speaker 1: like the idea that I would wear a coat to keep myself dry just seems silly.

860
00:57:32,052 --> 00:57:38,942
Speaker 1: I had to use an umbrella or I get wet and raise my umbrella - No, well because I grew up in a place.

861
00:57:38,962 --> 00:57:40,610
Speaker 0: you see you you changed your mind.

862
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:41,392
Speaker 1: Yeah you know why.

863
00:57:41,452 --> 00:57:43,825
Speaker 1: cuz I live in a place where I walk everywhere and I live in New York.

864
00:57:44,006 --> 00:57:50,440
Speaker 1: when I used to not live in New York when I lived in Michigan or even when I lived in the suburbs, I Never needed to go outside in the rain.

865
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,250
Speaker 1: And when I did I only really needed to get to my car.

866
00:57:52,392 --> 00:57:55,661
Speaker 1: I just run for it Like I wouldn't get that wet not wet enough to matter.

867
00:57:56,123 --> 00:58:05,195
Speaker 1: when I grew up like no one ever used an umbrella they Someone would like drop you off in front of the mall and then like one person in the family would have one giant umbrella just To get themselves in.

868
00:58:05,517 --> 00:58:09,717
Speaker 1: no one else have had an umbrella or even owned one half the time We had umbrellas.

869
00:58:09,898 --> 00:58:10,421
Speaker 1: Yeah, we didn't.

870
00:58:10,622 --> 00:58:12,412
Speaker 1: it's just a thing in Michigan I guess.

871
00:58:12,513 --> 00:58:18,477
Speaker 1: but I guess my point is a raincoat that Sands umbrella can keep you connects.

872
00:58:18,497 --> 00:58:19,440
Speaker 0: Thursday umbrellas.

873
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:21,165
Speaker 0: All right next keep going seems.

874
00:58:21,366 --> 00:58:22,650
Speaker 1: Oh, I got opinions on umbrellas.

875
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:24,141
Speaker 1: They got that fancy when I imported.

876
00:58:24,262 --> 00:58:24,806
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll do it.

877
00:58:24,866 --> 00:58:27,223
Speaker 1: Not now That umbrella is so good.

878
00:58:27,263 --> 00:58:27,829
Speaker 1: But yeah, not now.

879
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:33,929
Speaker 1: Restrain how it's how much I love that fucking umbrella that I paid $100 to import from Europe.

880
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:39,324
Speaker 1: Anyway, I was hundred dollars in import plus what it actually cost.

881
00:58:39,384 --> 00:58:55,985
Speaker 1: It was a. this was a expensive of a brand Mm-hmm, and it's the second one because the first one I bought got stolen anyway, so If I wear a coat that in driving rain would keep the top of me dry but the rest of me gets wet I feel like there's zero value in that.

882
00:58:56,045 --> 00:59:07,479
Speaker 1: if my pants are wet, I don't care if the rest of me is wet and rain gear that would keep my body effectively completely dry is Stupid unless I'm out in the backcountry hiking.

883
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:09,124
Speaker 1: We're away from civilization.

884
00:59:09,205 --> 00:59:13,257
Speaker 1: Like I'm not willing obviously because Gear that can keep you completely dry.

885
00:59:13,277 --> 00:59:17,009
Speaker 1: It kind of like the security paradox of more security means more pain in the ass.

886
00:59:17,872 --> 00:59:20,220
Speaker 1: More dryness means less comfort.

887
00:59:20,661 --> 00:59:21,905
Speaker 1: That's just how it works.

888
00:59:22,306 --> 00:59:23,330
Speaker 1: You want to be completely dry?

889
00:59:23,610 --> 00:59:25,778
Speaker 1: You're wearing something that hermetically seals your body.

890
00:59:25,818 --> 00:59:27,805
Speaker 1: Guess what that shit sucks to wear.

891
00:59:27,825 --> 00:59:31,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wasn't interesting on you Really interesting to being completely dry.

892
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:32,563
Speaker 0: that's not right.

893
00:59:32,603 --> 00:59:36,169
Speaker 0: It's like I bet you like I said when I left the house I sacrificed my shoes socks.

894
00:59:36,351 --> 00:59:40,290
Speaker 0: I wore shorts because I knew that jeans would get soggy and uncomfortable even though a little bit cold.

895
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:43,239
Speaker 1: So you understood your threat profile like what you were seeking here?

896
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like I just need enough of me to be dry.

897
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:49,622
Speaker 0: Right, you know so that I can you know walk around if I'm.

898
00:59:49,662 --> 00:59:56,134
Speaker 0: just if I was just out there with you know Nothing, it would be like that would be horrible Uncomfortable and Cold.

899
00:59:56,194 --> 01:00:07,402
Speaker 1: and because that then it gets into because outerwear from one definition could just mean whatever the furthest out layer of clothes you have on is and If you go to any clothing store.

900
01:00:07,443 --> 01:00:10,877
Speaker 0: if you click on the outerwear section You're gonna see raincoats.

901
01:00:11,218 --> 01:00:16,402
Speaker 0: winter coats had a little like jackets hoodies Or outerwear hoodie some.

902
01:00:16,482 --> 01:00:17,750
Speaker 0: sometimes you'll see hoodies in there.

903
01:00:17,811 --> 01:00:27,150
Speaker 0: Sometimes you'll see it in a different section But usually when they say outerwear they mean jackets and occasionally it'll be something like snow pants depending on the website.

904
01:00:27,414 --> 01:00:32,862
Speaker 0: Yeah, that might qualify but usually it's various jackets for different situations, right,

905
01:00:33,083 --> 01:00:43,730
Speaker 1: but I guess what I'm getting out there is that I Wear if I'm gonna get wet like if I go outside hiking like I don't bring rain gear Even if I'm going on a very long hike or camping expedition.

906
01:00:44,372 --> 01:00:55,249
Speaker 1: What I bring is I wear outerwear and clothes that are themselves expensive and beyond the scope of the show That are wicking and designed to get wet and dry quickly and I just let myself get wet.

907
01:00:56,133 --> 01:01:05,110
Speaker 1: But if I were not wearing that specialized clothing Which I don't want to wear in normal circumstances Like I wouldn't wear that at a pecs because that kind of clothing has other problems.

908
01:01:05,551 --> 01:01:07,779
Speaker 1: It smells bad way earlier than normal clothes.

909
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,063
Speaker 1: Like it's harder to wash.

910
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:09,886
Speaker 1: It's more expensive.

911
01:01:10,187 --> 01:01:11,210
Speaker 1: It wears out faster.

912
01:01:11,994 --> 01:01:13,663
Speaker 1: It's not that fashionable like.

913
01:01:13,804 --> 01:01:14,869
Speaker 1: there's a lot of other reasons there.

914
01:01:15,372 --> 01:01:19,610
Speaker 1: But if I was wearing like a packs t-shirt and jeans and I got soaked.

915
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:21,255
Speaker 1: Absolute misery.

916
01:01:21,516 --> 01:01:24,169
Speaker 1: that is that is one of the most miserable situations you can be in.

917
01:01:25,332 --> 01:01:34,850
Speaker 0: I mean forgetting, you know the current world situation where you know A lot of jackets are like inherited from the sporting outdoors world and brought down into the fashion world.

918
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:42,230
Speaker 0: You look at how many people in you know, New York City the fashionable thing is to wear a Canada Goose jacket Which is originally meant for like trekking around in the Arctic.

919
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:47,676
Speaker 0: $500 like a fashion statement.

920
01:01:47,816 --> 01:01:52,130
Speaker 1: Yeah 500 but contrast that because the jacket is still aimed as a fashion accessory.

921
01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:56,103
Speaker 1: $500 doesn't even buy you close to the jacket.

922
01:01:56,123 --> 01:01:57,650
Speaker 1: You need to go trekking around in the Arctic.

923
01:01:58,432 --> 01:02:00,850
Speaker 0: Well, I mean people did go trekking around the Arctic with those jackets.

924
01:02:00,931 --> 01:02:02,950
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah company the same jackets.

925
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:06,290
Speaker 0: But obviously if you're doing it now you would buy a higher-end model from that company.

926
01:02:07,392 --> 01:02:16,900
Speaker 1: Like I. just it's a thought that runs through my head every time I ski because I put on all this outerwear like jackets and gloves and everything and I Just and I don't even have the most expensive stuff.

927
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:20,136
Speaker 1: Like I said, I use a normal ass ski jacket I use like crappy.

928
01:02:20,156 --> 01:02:20,779
Speaker 0: you have better.

929
01:02:20,819 --> 01:02:23,370
Speaker 0: you have better than what rich people had last century.

930
01:02:23,702 --> 01:02:34,050
Speaker 1: Yep like I have better equipment on me to walk through the snow to buy groceries in the winter than Anyone in the HMS Terror and Erebus expedition had when they went to the pole and died.

931
01:02:35,052 --> 01:02:38,650
Speaker 0: Yep, pretty much but yeah, you know forgetting about that sort of jacket, right?

932
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:45,874
Speaker 0: there's all kinds of other kinds and the purpose of most jackets really if you think about it is Temporary shirt.

933
01:02:46,155 --> 01:02:46,356
Speaker 1: Yep.

934
01:02:47,019 --> 01:02:56,109
Speaker 0: It's like you put a shirt on your body to you know Just cover your torso when you're going outside because that's a normal thing to do and you can't really take that off.

935
01:02:57,232 --> 01:03:07,033
Speaker 0: But sometimes right you're gonna be going you're gonna be leaving your clear wardrobe behind and venturing into the world And you're going to encounter Different temperature.

936
01:03:07,094 --> 01:03:10,106
Speaker 0: right if you're just going to a single place with one temperature, right?

937
01:03:10,146 --> 01:03:14,621
Speaker 0: I'm going for a walk outside You know then you can you could.

938
01:03:14,801 --> 01:03:16,910
Speaker 0: you don't need a jacket like this temporary shirt.

939
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:25,107
Speaker 0: You could just shirt yourself appropriately with permanent shirts or at least, you know the kind you're not gonna take off While you're on that walk and then come home.

940
01:03:25,651 --> 01:03:29,270
Speaker 0: The jacket is because I'm going to go outside and it's gonna be cold.

941
01:03:29,511 --> 01:03:33,370
Speaker 0: So I'll put this extra shirt on but it has a big ol zipper in the front or buttons or something.

942
01:03:33,852 --> 01:03:38,049
Speaker 0: And then when I get where I'm going, I'll take it off and that won't be getting naked.

943
01:03:39,114 --> 01:03:50,350
Speaker 0: And when I leave but it's like people, you know, it's something everyone just inherently knows But you don't really think about it in terms, you know in that in that way because it's such a natural thing You know examine it closely.

944
01:03:50,450 --> 01:04:01,144
Speaker 0: But like that's what a jacket is the temporary like plus shirt that you you know can take on and off Appropriately at different locations to adjust your temperature level.

945
01:04:01,445 --> 01:04:02,970
Speaker 1: Hmm our case in point.

946
01:04:03,592 --> 01:04:06,002
Speaker 1: But it can be inverted like so I Pat and a PAX.

947
01:04:06,283 --> 01:04:07,608
Speaker 1: the jacket is just like PAX East.

948
01:04:07,668 --> 01:04:11,930
Speaker 1: in the winter It's just to get me to that building and then the jacket is just a liability.

949
01:04:11,950 --> 01:04:16,589
Speaker 1: I don't want to carry it with me so I can hang it up somewhere I can leave it somewhere and come back to it.

950
01:04:17,591 --> 01:04:18,617
Speaker 0: The coat hook was invented.

951
01:04:18,717 --> 01:04:20,526
Speaker 1: Yeah, the coat hook or the coat check.

952
01:04:21,109 --> 01:04:27,390
Speaker 1: I I always I do actually really like using coat checks and I find a lot of people avoid them.

953
01:04:27,714 --> 01:04:32,470
Speaker 1: but the caveat is Any large event the coat check is more trouble than it's worth.

954
01:04:33,372 --> 01:04:36,590
Speaker 0: It depends on how the coach at PAX that coat check is a fucking nightmare.

955
01:04:36,690 --> 01:04:48,449
Speaker 0: I'm so always if I if I'm thinking about a coat check if I see one and it would be advantageous to me I scope it first to see how it's operating and I try to predict like is it going to be a shit show?

956
01:04:48,469 --> 01:04:55,190
Speaker 0: when I Try to leave, you know, then I that and I make my decision, you know How shitty will it be if I have to hold on to this coat the whole time?

957
01:04:55,930 --> 01:04:56,374
Speaker 0: Etc.

958
01:04:56,455 --> 01:04:58,150
Speaker 1: And then also there's another point here.

959
01:04:58,551 --> 01:05:07,041
Speaker 1: This is a very different situation from the things that I usually do of going out to the wilderness or doing some crazy sport where it's all about layering like.

960
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:17,863
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna layer to a PAX with like multiple different levels of like shirt outer shirt fourth shirt jacket because I don't need that many levels of clothing and comfort to switch between.

961
01:05:17,884 --> 01:05:30,010
Speaker 1: and The key of a jacket is that it's very easy to take on and put it to put on and take off Compared to like a secondary base layer that I have to like peel up over my head or deal with in some way.

962
01:05:30,351 --> 01:05:31,716
Speaker 0: I get to think about.

963
01:05:31,877 --> 01:05:35,250
Speaker 0: think about the layers when it comes to not outdoors enos, right?

964
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:37,400
Speaker 0: But think about the layers for formal wear, right?

965
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:38,866
Speaker 0: So it's like you got a shirt right.

966
01:05:38,887 --> 01:05:40,194
Speaker 0: the dress shirt That's the.

967
01:05:40,315 --> 01:05:41,100
Speaker 0: that's the thing.

968
01:05:41,221 --> 01:05:42,530
Speaker 0: The dress shirt is the thing.

969
01:05:42,570 --> 01:05:46,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, you usually have an undershirt under the dress shirt to protect the shirt, right?

970
01:05:46,551 --> 01:05:58,290
Speaker 0: It's a shirt that makes you look good But you put a shirt under it so that you a can't see through the dress shirts material to your hairy body or whatever Your body looks like and B to keep your sweat from messing up the dress shirt.

971
01:05:58,390 --> 01:05:59,253
Speaker 0: It's a dressy shirt.

972
01:05:59,876 --> 01:06:03,770
Speaker 0: Then you got a dress coat that goes over the dress shirt.

973
01:06:03,870 --> 01:06:10,753
Speaker 0: You can take it off and you will usually but it looks a lot nicer if you have that coat on right like your tuxedo Coat or whatever.

974
01:06:11,155 --> 01:06:14,170
Speaker 0: so, you know, you'll have that on during your ceremonies and whatever.

975
01:06:14,291 --> 01:06:16,390
Speaker 0: But you might take it off when you're sitting down to eat dinner.

976
01:06:16,531 --> 01:06:25,944
Speaker 1: Go to any wedding, but it's everyone all the all the all the people who wear suits are wearing suits And once they sit down for dinner 90% of those suits get unbuttoned and they're hung over the back of the chair.

977
01:06:26,045 --> 01:06:31,503
Speaker 1: and now you only got a vest on Exactly, and then let's not even talk about the vest right?

978
01:06:31,544 --> 01:06:32,186
Speaker 0: But here's the thing.

979
01:06:32,246 --> 01:06:33,070
Speaker 0: What are the kind of bonds?

980
01:06:34,173 --> 01:06:35,470
Speaker 0: Well, that's not a part of the jacket.

981
01:06:36,511 --> 01:06:39,650
Speaker 0: So the jacket right, but this is a dress jacket.

982
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:43,590
Speaker 0: It's like a sport jacket or a suit coat or who knows we all tuxedo coat something like that.

983
01:06:43,952 --> 01:06:44,597
Speaker 0: That is not.

984
01:06:44,658 --> 01:06:46,149
Speaker 0: I mean it does keep you pretty warm.

985
01:06:47,092 --> 01:06:49,546
Speaker 0: And if it's a little chilly outside like in the fall, that's perfect.

986
01:06:49,566 --> 01:06:50,150
Speaker 0: That's sufficient.

987
01:06:51,170 --> 01:06:55,467
Speaker 0: But if it's gonna rain or something, well you this is such a dressy coat.

988
01:06:55,547 --> 01:06:56,472
Speaker 0: It's not just a coat That's.

989
01:06:56,492 --> 01:06:57,869
Speaker 1: you can't let water touch that thing.

990
01:06:58,711 --> 01:07:03,530
Speaker 0: So now you need like the trench coat or something now right to go over that shit.

991
01:07:04,012 --> 01:07:07,230
Speaker 0: Right and that trench coat is what the coat check was for.

992
01:07:07,418 --> 01:07:13,883
Speaker 0: Yeah So that when you show up at the Broadway show or the dinner party or whatever the fuck it the concert at the opera Whatever the fuck it is, right?

993
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:19,950
Speaker 0: It's like you're gonna be wearing your fancy jacket while you're sitting and watching or doing or whatever because that's what looks good.

994
01:07:20,612 --> 01:07:26,490
Speaker 0: But you had to wear this raincoat that protected your dress coat and you don't want to bring that around with you.

995
01:07:26,530 --> 01:07:30,933
Speaker 0: It's all soaking wet and they didn't have better technology than trench coat in 1940 50 something.

996
01:07:31,434 --> 01:07:34,402
Speaker 0: but also that is what you give to the to the coat check.

997
01:07:34,422 --> 01:07:43,560
Speaker 1: so less fancy jackets like a sport jacket or A blazer blazer or the top of a leisure suit like that kind of stuff Partly because of my job and also just because I like them.

998
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:47,788
Speaker 1: like I wear those a lot in my daily life like when I'm Like pre-covid times like when I'm going out.

999
01:07:48,932 --> 01:07:51,566
Speaker 1: But those are different because they're designed to be worn every day.

1000
01:07:51,586 --> 01:07:55,966
Speaker 1: So Until it's too cold to do this usually in the winter.

1001
01:07:56,086 --> 01:07:56,810
Speaker 1: I don't wear a coat.

1002
01:07:57,312 --> 01:08:01,839
Speaker 1: I just wear a heavy sport jacket on my way to and from work with like Scarf and that's it.

1003
01:08:01,899 --> 01:08:03,390
Speaker 1: Like I don't actually wear like a coat.

1004
01:08:03,932 --> 01:08:05,800
Speaker 1: I actually don't own that many coats.

1005
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:09,500
Speaker 1: Like if I look at what I own I have one Insulated trench coat.

1006
01:08:09,741 --> 01:08:10,770
Speaker 1: that is my winter coat.

1007
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:11,693
Speaker 1: I fucking love that thing.

1008
01:08:11,733 --> 01:08:18,269
Speaker 1: trench coats long coats are the best if you're not doing a sport Because they keep your legs warm too.

1009
01:08:18,591 --> 01:08:20,857
Speaker 1: They hold in so much heat like.

1010
01:08:21,499 --> 01:08:25,368
Speaker 1: it's hard for me to imagine not living my life without a long coat in the winter.

1011
01:08:26,513 --> 01:08:27,536
Speaker 1: It's my favorite kind of coat.

1012
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:30,045
Speaker 1: I used to wear dusters, but that's cuz.

1013
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:31,370
Speaker 1: I was awesome in high school.

1014
01:08:31,531 --> 01:08:35,669
Speaker 1: I do like dusters, but the long insulated jacket is what I actually need.

1015
01:08:36,691 --> 01:08:39,341
Speaker 0: Let's talk about some like different coat styles, right?

1016
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:40,325
Speaker 0: So one coat style.

1017
01:08:40,385 --> 01:08:46,886
Speaker 0: I actually like a lot Is like the bomber jacket style where it's like, oh, I like those in middle school.

1018
01:08:46,926 --> 01:08:48,090
Speaker 1: I'm not a big fan anymore.

1019
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:50,296
Speaker 0: It's a little bit insulated, right?

1020
01:08:50,358 --> 01:08:51,301
Speaker 0: It's kind of styling.

1021
01:08:51,421 --> 01:08:52,926
Speaker 1: you can really puffy like.

1022
01:08:52,946 --> 01:08:53,990
Speaker 1: you have a big puff around you.

1023
01:08:54,729 --> 01:08:57,078
Speaker 0: Sometimes they're puffy, but sometimes they're not so puffy.

1024
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:58,625
Speaker 0: It depends on which one you get.

1025
01:08:58,665 --> 01:08:59,870
Speaker 0: There's various levels of puff.

1026
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:05,590
Speaker 0: They have those like a ribbed sort of cuffs around the arm the arms usually in the waist area.

1027
01:09:05,649 --> 01:09:06,576
Speaker 0: It's sort of keep it tight.

1028
01:09:06,898 --> 01:09:08,529
Speaker 0: So winds not coming in there and stuff.

1029
01:09:09,416 --> 01:09:13,859
Speaker 0: the thing I don't like about those is Pulling up the sleeves is kind of meh on them.

1030
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,709
Speaker 0: Some of them have zip-off sleeves actually, but not too many.

1031
01:09:18,121 --> 01:09:25,029
Speaker 1: the only bomber jackets I actually did really like and still kind of like are the ones that look like what they came from an actual bomber jacket.

1032
01:09:25,636 --> 01:09:26,728
Speaker 0: Yeah, most of them look like that.

1033
01:09:27,251 --> 01:09:33,630
Speaker 1: There seemed to be a whole bunch of fashion jackets called bomber jackets that look nothing like bomber jackets.

1034
01:09:34,930 --> 01:09:36,801
Speaker 1: Lot of people are calling things bomber jackets.

1035
01:09:36,821 --> 01:09:39,551
Speaker 1: that I would not consider a bomber jacket Usually.

1036
01:09:39,792 --> 01:09:46,407
Speaker 0: what the the one that William Gibson made famous is the one that you know is really popular and then most people are modeling it After that one, right?

1037
01:09:46,830 --> 01:09:49,447
Speaker 1: So but now I'm talking about the ones like the traditional.

1038
01:09:49,548 --> 01:09:58,161
Speaker 1: one is Brown with fur or fake fur around like the cuffs and around the neck and it zips up in the front and it's puffy and A lot of leather and that's pretty much it.

1039
01:09:58,605 --> 01:10:01,686
Speaker 0: Yeah, the fur Is optional sometimes right.

1040
01:10:01,706 --> 01:10:05,310
Speaker 1: the fuzzy ones Yeah, not that I would ever wear a ferg like don't get me wrong, right?

1041
01:10:05,530 --> 01:10:06,859
Speaker 0: But the thing is it's sort of like it.

1042
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:16,177
Speaker 0: those are sort of like these in-between Kind of jackets, right because you know, you can actually keep that one on as long as you're not, you know Sweating like crazy, right?

1043
01:10:16,297 --> 01:10:31,747
Speaker 0: It's like you can you know, keep that on and it's almost occupying the sort of sport coat zone right where it's it's as opposed to the You know hang up zone but for normal everyday stuff and not for fancy stuff.

1044
01:10:32,028 --> 01:10:38,490
Speaker 0: Yep, right There's a few other coats that sort of occupy that same space like like some parkas and stuff.

1045
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:44,130
Speaker 0: You can wear them right and just keep them on all the time and it doesn't look like why are you wearing your coat?

1046
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:46,945
Speaker 0: Even though we're inside now It's like it's.

1047
01:10:47,147 --> 01:10:51,427
Speaker 0: you know It's almost like a hoodie where it's still acceptable to keep wearing it Even when you're in the thing.

1048
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:52,714
Speaker 0: There's other coats.

1049
01:10:52,996 --> 01:11:05,576
Speaker 0: if you wear like one of those big old pea coats and you show up and you don't take it off And you're sitting in the restaurant with your pea coat on without like those big buttons with the anchors on Even if you unbutton it It's like you look really silly.

1050
01:11:05,657 --> 01:11:07,625
Speaker 0: if you keep that shit on you get your North Face coat.

1051
01:11:07,866 --> 01:11:13,710
Speaker 0: if you sit down at the restaurant Or in the theater and you still have that on and you haven't taken it off people would be like, are you cold?

1052
01:11:13,810 --> 01:11:14,295
Speaker 0: Are you all right?

1053
01:11:14,315 --> 01:11:14,739
Speaker 0: What's wrong?

1054
01:11:14,780 --> 01:11:22,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I Have worn my North Face ski jacket indoors at conventions in the past because sometimes that AC is sometimes it's cold.

1055
01:11:23,011 --> 01:11:24,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, then you'd be like, yeah, it's cold.

1056
01:11:24,651 --> 01:11:27,001
Speaker 1: People are constantly being like why you were in your winter coat.

1057
01:11:27,081 --> 01:11:28,186
Speaker 1: It's like what the fuck is wrong with you.

1058
01:11:28,206 --> 01:11:28,949
Speaker 1: Do you not feel this?

1059
01:11:30,230 --> 01:11:36,234
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are some but there's other kinds of coats right that you can that you can keep wearing and it's like Oh, that doesn't look.

1060
01:11:36,354 --> 01:11:38,043
Speaker 0: you don't look ridiculous keeping that on.

1061
01:11:38,264 --> 01:11:43,269
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Interestingly is because I wear blazers and sport jackets so much.

1062
01:11:44,111 --> 01:11:48,149
Speaker 1: I don't own a single one of though what you would want that kind of coat that you described not one.

1063
01:11:49,131 --> 01:11:51,122
Speaker 0: See the problem I have is actually I own a couple.

1064
01:11:51,282 --> 01:11:52,589
Speaker 0: I think I got like one or two, right?

1065
01:11:52,790 --> 01:12:06,111
Speaker 0: but the problem is is if I want to wear it as a You know inside coat like not take it off Then you could end up looking silly if say you go to you're going to work in the year 2021.

1066
01:12:06,111 --> 01:12:16,078
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you went to work every day and you changed all your clothes every day But you had like some bomber jacket and you just wore it all day every day at work It'd be like why you always wearing the same.

1067
01:12:16,119 --> 01:12:22,078
Speaker 1: and the difference is I can wear the same blazer for weeks on end Because people don't notice that it fades into the background.

1068
01:12:22,359 --> 01:12:24,404
Speaker 1: the shirt under it changes every day.

1069
01:12:24,445 --> 01:12:26,833
Speaker 1: the pants combined with it change every day So it's.

1070
01:12:26,853 --> 01:12:33,025
Speaker 0: you can also see the shirt a lot more through us Big the deep V going on in the front, right?

1071
01:12:33,166 --> 01:12:33,930
Speaker 1: Exactly So.

1072
01:12:34,492 --> 01:12:38,364
Speaker 1: so but yeah, I don't own anything like but my but I go straight.

1073
01:12:38,424 --> 01:12:40,310
Speaker 1: I go between hoodie and above hoodie.

1074
01:12:40,491 --> 01:12:52,127
Speaker 0: It's like I don't have anything until I get to but to which I Several different coats that are appropriate for wearing and not taking off Right is a lot of money and a lot of closet space.

1075
01:12:52,188 --> 01:12:58,090
Speaker 1: that Actually is what I was about to say because that is why I don't own any of the coats you described like not one.

1076
01:12:58,752 --> 01:13:04,190
Speaker 1: I have so many highly specialized like sporting outdoor coats that I don't really have room to have more.

1077
01:13:04,571 --> 01:13:09,790
Speaker 1: So I try to use those instead of what you described as a more normal jacket.

1078
01:13:09,870 --> 01:13:11,581
Speaker 1: So I go from my coats.

1079
01:13:11,621 --> 01:13:16,070
Speaker 1: go from lightest to heaviest Summit jacket, which I'll get back to after that.

1080
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:21,370
Speaker 1: It's hoodie or fleece like but you're just like me my base layers for skiing and stuff.

1081
01:13:22,112 --> 01:13:30,263
Speaker 1: the next step after that is like when my ski jacket and the next step beyond that is my Fully insulated trench coat and I got nothing else.

1082
01:13:30,303 --> 01:13:32,436
Speaker 0: His is the list of coats I got right.

1083
01:13:32,516 --> 01:13:34,129
Speaker 0: actually actually I might have more coats than you.

1084
01:13:34,371 --> 01:13:38,130
Speaker 1: Oh, you definitely have more coats than me because my coats are few and expensive and bulky.

1085
01:13:38,873 --> 01:13:42,145
Speaker 0: Some of mine are at least a little bit expensive not now and probably I don't.

1086
01:13:42,165 --> 01:13:47,650
Speaker 0: probably don't have a single coat That's more expensive than your most expensive coat, but I have several hundred dollars.

1087
01:13:47,831 --> 01:13:50,070
Speaker 1: I one way I can cheat my most expensive coat.

1088
01:13:50,251 --> 01:13:53,825
Speaker 1: I paid very little money for because it had a slight defect and I got it for like nothing.

1089
01:13:53,865 --> 01:14:03,449
Speaker 0: clearance sale Good deal Yeah, so assume forgetting the things that I have abandoned and don't wear anymore, right?

1090
01:14:04,571 --> 01:14:07,081
Speaker 0: That I might still have somewhere like packs hoodies I've abandoned.

1091
01:14:07,121 --> 01:14:07,282
Speaker 0: right?

1092
01:14:07,603 --> 01:14:09,290
Speaker 0: I have two hoodies now that I actually wear.

1093
01:14:09,752 --> 01:14:13,370
Speaker 0: They're basically the same hoodie, but one is lighter than the other for different seasons.

1094
01:14:14,613 --> 01:14:15,198
Speaker 0: So there you go.

1095
01:14:15,218 --> 01:14:16,570
Speaker 0: I got two hoodies, right?

1096
01:14:16,871 --> 01:14:17,816
Speaker 0: I then I have.

1097
01:14:17,836 --> 01:14:19,284
Speaker 0: I guess I'm gonna have to rip.

1098
01:14:19,445 --> 01:14:20,470
Speaker 0: I had two raincoats.

1099
01:14:20,530 --> 01:14:27,059
Speaker 0: I had the one that died the pla- it was basically just a sheet of plastic for 20 bucks And I had like a real kind of raincoat.

1100
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:35,030
Speaker 0: the problem with my real kind of raincoat is it's still pretty good But it hasn't like an insulating layer which works very well.

1101
01:14:35,531 --> 01:14:40,970
Speaker 0: But sometimes it rains and you're not it's not cold and then it sucks to wear that coat because way too hot in it.

1102
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:45,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, also the sleeves on it are too short and you can't make sleeves longer and my arms are long.

1103
01:14:45,912 --> 01:14:55,022
Speaker 0: so I think I'm gonna abandon the broken plastic sheet and donate the good raincoat and Just get something that's a raincoat that fits and have that be the raincoat.

1104
01:14:55,504 --> 01:14:56,046
Speaker 0: So raincoat.

1105
01:14:56,428 --> 01:15:06,849
Speaker 0: then I Have a special like ultra thin, you know Plasticy raincoat that is only good for biking if you wear it when you're not biking you look like a dingus.

1106
01:15:08,431 --> 01:15:10,861
Speaker 0: But if you're biking in the rain, it's incredible.

1107
01:15:10,901 --> 01:15:13,210
Speaker 0: like you'll you can actually bike in the rain with this thing.

1108
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:17,406
Speaker 1: I've been thinking about getting something like that because it wasn't cheap.

1109
01:15:17,486 --> 01:15:18,490
Speaker 0: It wasn't the cheapest.

1110
01:15:18,651 --> 01:15:25,574
Speaker 0: It's just like a sheet of plastic kind of situation, but I assume it's gonna last my whole life and it's amazing Biking stuff the same way.

1111
01:15:25,594 --> 01:15:26,458
Speaker 1: I approach my ski stuff.

1112
01:15:26,498 --> 01:15:29,250
Speaker 0: It sounds like I have a second biking only coat.

1113
01:15:29,412 --> 01:15:30,549
Speaker 0: It is for biking in the cold.

1114
01:15:30,892 --> 01:15:40,330
Speaker 0: I can't bike in like fucking snowy winter with it But like I can bike in like, you know close to freezing as long as it's not snowing or anything.

1115
01:15:40,771 --> 01:15:44,220
Speaker 0: It's not like ultra below zero if it's that warm.

1116
01:15:44,281 --> 01:15:50,421
Speaker 0: if you wear this while biking and the problem is most coats You wear while biking you start to get all sweaty inside this one.

1117
01:15:50,621 --> 01:15:50,762
Speaker 0: Nope.

1118
01:15:51,204 --> 01:15:52,810
Speaker 0: You feel great while biking if it's cold.

1119
01:15:52,951 --> 01:15:54,530
Speaker 1: That's what that's actually what I do with biking.

1120
01:15:54,671 --> 01:15:58,345
Speaker 1: I don't have a biking specific one, but guess what, but all the kit I use for skiing.

1121
01:15:58,727 --> 01:16:07,150
Speaker 1: not the pants obviously But like the top part Perfect for biking except it's less aerodynamic than a bike specific solution, but it's perfectly comfortable.

1122
01:16:08,071 --> 01:16:14,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, alright, so then so I got the two biking coats one for just it's wet out But it's warm and the other four it's cold, but it's not wet.

1123
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:15,801
Speaker 0: I don't really have a cold.

1124
01:16:15,902 --> 01:16:22,210
Speaker 0: if it's cold and wet I don't bike so I don't have I don't need a third biking coat and I don't have to combine the two either.

1125
01:16:23,932 --> 01:16:24,756
Speaker 1: The listeners are also.

1126
01:16:24,796 --> 01:16:26,465
Speaker 1: they've all devolved into still suit.

1127
01:16:26,526 --> 01:16:27,109
Speaker 1: That's the way to go.

1128
01:16:27,732 --> 01:16:30,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have a bomber ish kind of jacket that I can wear.

1129
01:16:31,211 --> 01:16:34,526
Speaker 0: You know when it's like a little bit cold like you're going maybe apple picking or something, right?

1130
01:16:34,566 --> 01:16:38,743
Speaker 0: It's not too cold out You know, you're not freezing but obviously it's too cold to go with no coat.

1131
01:16:38,903 --> 01:16:42,215
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know kind of in-between deal Right see in that situation.

1132
01:16:42,236 --> 01:16:44,243
Speaker 1: I either wear a hoodie or wear my hiking gear.

1133
01:16:44,263 --> 01:16:46,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, then I got two more.

1134
01:16:46,311 --> 01:16:49,370
Speaker 0: I got two wintry coats I used to have in the old back in the day.

1135
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:52,669
Speaker 0: I used to always buy a North Face kind of thing, but I got tired of that.

1136
01:16:52,890 --> 01:16:53,753
Speaker 0: Yeah, so what I have.

1137
01:16:54,034 --> 01:16:59,230
Speaker 0: so what I have now is I have one that's sort of like a pea coat kind of ish situation.

1138
01:16:59,351 --> 01:17:11,215
Speaker 0: You know what the buttons as zipper end, you know, whatever in a hood that you can detach, you know It's that same kind of material and basically it doesn't matter if it's cold as long as it's not snowing because obviously there's no real Waterproofness to it.

1139
01:17:11,235 --> 01:17:11,416
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1140
01:17:11,456 --> 01:17:12,099
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.

1141
01:17:12,541 --> 01:17:27,290
Speaker 0: But as if it's just cold, it's great It keeps you way warm in there right deep pockets nicely It's you know great, but then I have another one that's basically the it's snowing jacket Which is actually two jackets one that goes inside the other one so I could separate them and use just half for half.

1142
01:17:27,511 --> 01:17:29,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, all ski jackets are like that.

1143
01:17:29,330 --> 01:17:33,910
Speaker 1: Usually the ski jacket is just a shell and you zip an insulator into it and then you do more and more layers.

1144
01:17:34,712 --> 01:17:40,527
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is I think it's the one this is technically called like a three-way jacket But I pretty much only wear if it's cold and snowing.

1145
01:17:40,829 --> 01:17:44,864
Speaker 1: Yeah it's well because what I found is those jackets like my ski jacket.

1146
01:17:45,226 --> 01:17:52,101
Speaker 1: I can wear the whole thing or I can unzip the insulating layer out of it and wear it just as a shell or Yeah

1147
01:17:52,210 --> 01:17:58,890
Speaker 0: The problem even if I tip thing is this one Even if you know there are ones where the insulating layer is like where all the insulation is this one.

1148
01:17:59,271 --> 01:18:00,917
Speaker 0: Some of the insulation is in both layers.

1149
01:18:00,997 --> 01:18:04,550
Speaker 0: if I just try to wear the outside only it's like you're still pretty warm.

1150
01:18:04,791 --> 01:18:07,590
Speaker 0: Right, if you wear the inside only it's like well, why don't I just wear the bomber jacket?

1151
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:09,217
Speaker 1: Yeah, my jacket cuz it's fancier.

1152
01:18:09,559 --> 01:18:11,670
Speaker 1: The outside is completely on insulated.

1153
01:18:11,771 --> 01:18:14,310
Speaker 1: I can just use it as a shell and mix and match what I want to use inside.

1154
01:18:14,711 --> 01:18:24,435
Speaker 1: But the inside part is also a jacket that is perfectly capable of being worn on its own and it's actually great for That mid-tier situation.

1155
01:18:24,455 --> 01:18:41,510
Speaker 1: The only reason I don't use it for that purpose and and fill that gap in my wardrobe is that I use this jacket to ski and I ski a lot and it It looks grody as shit from the grease of my body and the sweat and just mess of skiing.

1156
01:18:42,173 --> 01:18:45,667
Speaker 1: And I mean when I went to her I'm cleaning we'll make that thing look like I'm not a hobo.

1157
01:18:45,948 --> 01:18:50,845
Speaker 0: so that is When we went to college, I knew it was gonna be snowy in Rochester.

1158
01:18:50,885 --> 01:18:52,510
Speaker 0: That's what I brought with me freshman year.

1159
01:18:52,610 --> 01:18:58,196
Speaker 0: I bought like the fanciest Gore Tex like outer shell and I got the fanciest inside I mean for Rochester.

1160
01:18:58,217 --> 01:19:00,069
Speaker 1: that might not save your life on the quarter-mile.

1161
01:19:00,954 --> 01:19:06,730
Speaker 0: But that's that's what I had for years at RIT and I you know I only did died because I buy it was killed by Rochester.

1162
01:19:07,413 --> 01:19:12,358
Speaker 0: I had the fanciest thing that you know, but I realized when I left Rochester I don't really need that anymore.

1163
01:19:12,398 --> 01:19:13,807
Speaker 0: That was that's not necessary now.

1164
01:19:13,847 --> 01:19:20,150
Speaker 1: Yep So yeah, you have way more jackets than me, but we both have a lot of highly specialized jackets.

1165
01:19:20,971 --> 01:19:24,446
Speaker 0: Cuz yeah, I mean if you do specialize I guess I you know, I'm not even counting like.

1166
01:19:24,466 --> 01:19:25,230
Speaker 0: I have one suit.

1167
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:27,079
Speaker 1: I was about to say I have more jacket.

1168
01:19:27,099 --> 01:19:27,943
Speaker 0: I have one jacket.

1169
01:19:27,984 --> 01:19:29,230
Speaker 0: That's not a part of a suit.

1170
01:19:29,551 --> 01:19:33,510
Speaker 1: I have more jackets than you if we count Blazers and like leisure suits and all that.

1171
01:19:33,550 --> 01:19:36,101
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have one two, three, four five two.

1172
01:19:36,221 --> 01:19:44,893
Speaker 1: I have 11 sport jackets That I wear regularly and in the non-covid times, obviously, I might have two suits, but only one of them I think is wearable.

1173
01:19:44,993 --> 01:19:48,185
Speaker 1: I have 11 sport jackets and I have three dress jackets.

1174
01:19:49,470 --> 01:19:51,130
Speaker 1: I Also have a seersucker that don't wear much anymore.

1175
01:19:52,791 --> 01:19:55,240
Speaker 0: But yeah, I guess I'm gonna downsize raincoats.

1176
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:56,926
Speaker 0: I'm gonna get rid of two and add one.

1177
01:19:56,946 --> 01:19:57,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, that'll be good.

1178
01:19:58,070 --> 01:20:03,070
Speaker 1: So the jacket I have that you don't have is the one that it look Marmot made it but they don't make it anymore.

1179
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:04,200
Speaker 1: I'm actually googling around this.

1180
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:05,349
Speaker 1: so I got this.

1181
01:20:05,792 --> 01:20:12,965
Speaker 1: I was in Salt Lake City years and years and years ago I was actually out in Park City like the ski resort But I was there to mountain bike in the off season.

1182
01:20:13,025 --> 01:20:17,069
Speaker 1: long story short I had a whole day with nothing to do and nothing was open before I could fly home.

1183
01:20:17,772 --> 01:20:20,720
Speaker 1: So I wander around this town and I find this sport shop.

1184
01:20:20,740 --> 01:20:22,425
Speaker 0: No, these are reasonable prices Marmot.

1185
01:20:22,666 --> 01:20:23,308
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Marmot is.

1186
01:20:23,508 --> 01:20:34,350
Speaker 1: Marmot is not to turn this into an ad but Marmot is The best like jacket where you're gonna get for a price that you Scott would consider reasonable.

1187
01:20:34,731 --> 01:20:38,059
Speaker 1: That is comparable in quality to the Arcturix stuff.

1188
01:20:38,099 --> 01:20:39,443
Speaker 1: That is just insane quality.

1189
01:20:39,463 --> 01:20:41,267
Speaker 0: Let's see rain rain.

1190
01:20:41,347 --> 01:20:48,723
Speaker 1: I mean where I every Marmot Outerwear item I've ever bought has been utterly phenomenal for the dollars.

1191
01:20:48,803 --> 01:20:49,104
Speaker 1: I paid.

1192
01:20:49,124 --> 01:20:51,030
Speaker 0: All right, let's check out these raincoats.

1193
01:20:51,231 --> 01:20:53,421
Speaker 1: So the thing I have they don't make anymore.

1194
01:20:53,663 --> 01:20:55,150
Speaker 1: They haven't made it for a long time.

1195
01:20:55,674 --> 01:21:06,170
Speaker 1: I bought it from this shop that had a like discount rack of Clearance items that were unsaleable or had defects or things like an outlet store and I paid $80 for this thing.

1196
01:21:06,713 --> 01:21:13,001
Speaker 1: it retailed for four or five hundred dollars, but It is so it's that that's that tiny jacket.

1197
01:21:13,021 --> 01:21:14,446
Speaker 1: I described it's so small.

1198
01:21:14,507 --> 01:21:15,470
Speaker 1: It's the size of my cell phone.

1199
01:21:15,531 --> 01:21:16,648
Speaker 1: I can just wad it into a ball.

1200
01:21:18,636 --> 01:21:19,122
Speaker 1: It's sort of.

1201
01:21:19,183 --> 01:21:20,814
Speaker 1: it's waterproof But that's not what it's used for.

1202
01:21:20,855 --> 01:21:27,440
Speaker 1: like you couldn't use this raincoat because the underarms are completely vented So you can just like vents your sweat out of them.

1203
01:21:28,102 --> 01:21:30,570
Speaker 1: these jackets are used for exactly two things.

1204
01:21:30,650 --> 01:21:33,478
Speaker 1: It's a highly specialized piece of basically outdoor survival gear.

1205
01:21:33,939 --> 01:21:43,890
Speaker 1: you carry it in your pack and you put it on when you're summiting a mountain Not a not a like super high mountain like Kilimanjaro, but like a normal moderate-sized mountain.

1206
01:21:44,372 --> 01:21:48,110
Speaker 1: It's just this extra layer you put on only at the top when you're making your summit approach.

1207
01:21:48,514 --> 01:22:05,519
Speaker 1: It's too much to wear on the whole trip But it's like a windbreaker you put on at the very end and the other use for it is it's an emergency layer That weighs nothing that you can whip out if you suddenly need a jacket and you literally have no Room weight space or anything to carry a jacket.

1208
01:22:05,559 --> 01:22:05,720
Speaker 1: like.

1209
01:22:06,101 --> 01:22:11,207
Speaker 1: I could put this jacket in my back pocket out of packs and just whip It out if suddenly it gets too cold late at night.

1210
01:22:12,351 --> 01:22:13,074
Speaker 1: You've seen me wear it.

1211
01:22:13,134 --> 01:22:14,661
Speaker 1: It's that shiny blue shirt.

1212
01:22:14,862 --> 01:22:22,830
Speaker 0: Oh the show's gone on way too long Yes, but I guess the final word on jacket is that one day we'll have some awesome cyberpunk.

1213
01:22:23,292 --> 01:22:25,464
Speaker 0: You know you'll just you'll just right you'll just have.

1214
01:22:25,484 --> 01:22:29,021
Speaker 0: you'll have cyber skin And you'll just change the fucking skin and you want to worry about that.

1215
01:22:29,061 --> 01:22:31,975
Speaker 0: and then your clothing can just be all style if you Even have clothing.

1216
01:22:32,699 --> 01:22:33,464
Speaker 0: so and that'll be great.
