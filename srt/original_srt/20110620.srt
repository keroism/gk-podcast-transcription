1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,368
Speaker 1: It's Monday June 20th 2011.

2
00:00:11,368 --> 00:00:12,110
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,331 --> 00:00:15,079
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight DNS.

4
00:00:18,641 --> 00:00:19,636
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:24,377 --> 00:00:33,176
Speaker 1: So, you know, I got the blackberry for work which I hate and really just turn off unless there's like the very few times where I'm on call for something and It just it's a tech.

6
00:00:33,217 --> 00:00:33,901
Speaker 1: I hate blackberries.

7
00:00:33,921 --> 00:00:35,510
Speaker 1: They're like the worst possible smartphone.

8
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:40,130
Speaker 1: They have all the bad qualities of a corporate phone without any of the good qualities of a smartphone.

9
00:00:40,451 --> 00:00:45,050
Speaker 0: Actually, I think blackberries don't get enough credit because I you know, I mean, I'm not saying they're good or anything.

10
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:49,110
Speaker 1: Well, though they get credit from me in the same way that Dungeons & Dragons gets credit.

11
00:00:49,503 --> 00:00:51,335
Speaker 0: No What I'm saying is that there's most.

12
00:00:51,335 --> 00:00:59,990
Speaker 0: 99% of people have blackberries have them hooked up to the company's network Yep on a blackberry enterprise server with all this stuff.

13
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:07,263
Speaker 0: Right, if you actually get a blackberry like the and they don't get the newest fanciest ones either It's usually whichever one the company gives you now.

14
00:01:07,283 --> 00:01:08,490
Speaker 1: We have all the newest fanciest ones.

15
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,716
Speaker 1: I pointedly refused to get the upgrade.

16
00:01:10,757 --> 00:01:12,782
Speaker 1: I still have that asshole blackberry.

17
00:01:12,802 --> 00:01:23,135
Speaker 0: You know, I the battery lasts like two weeks That's true But if you get the newest fanciest possible blackberry and it's not like hooked up to a company and locked down or whatever It's actually got.

18
00:01:23,557 --> 00:01:24,220
Speaker 0: you know, it's it.

19
00:01:24,401 --> 00:01:28,704
Speaker 0: you can do a whole bunch of stuff Yeah, but like here's one thing I've noticed everyone.

20
00:01:28,744 --> 00:01:29,770
Speaker 1: I know who has a blackberry.

21
00:01:30,292 --> 00:01:33,464
Speaker 1: Google latitude either doesn't work or just sucks.

22
00:01:33,785 --> 00:01:34,970
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, cuz he sucks.

23
00:01:35,352 --> 00:01:41,585
Speaker 0: They're not big on the GPS and blackberries is not the hottest Yeah, and the batteries don't last that long and the interface is pretty bad.

24
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:42,790
Speaker 1: And I just I don't like blackberries.

25
00:01:42,871 --> 00:01:44,386
Speaker 1: I've had to use them for a long for my life.

26
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:51,049
Speaker 0: I don't understand why it seems like there's a whole bunch of people this uses class like people especially business like top.

27
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,989
Speaker 0: I'll tell you why we're high up.

28
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,214
Speaker 0: I'll tell you why they want it.

29
00:01:54,255 --> 00:01:58,250
Speaker 0: they want a blackberry because it has a keyboard and they want to write long emails on it.

30
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,575
Speaker 1: That's not why they want it.

31
00:01:59,616 --> 00:01:59,997
Speaker 1: They want.

32
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,046
Speaker 1: here's why they say they like the inner.

33
00:02:02,086 --> 00:02:02,930
Speaker 0: Well, that's what they say.

34
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:10,979
Speaker 1: No, because first of all, you know until recently my blackberry still doesn't have the little a wheel Because a lot of them are not touch screens like most of them aren't?

35
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:14,759
Speaker 1: it has the slidey wheel like the mouse wheel on the side for your thumb.

36
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,259
Speaker 0: Yep, and What has some of them?

37
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:18,250
Speaker 0: have the nub on the front?

38
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:22,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's kind of new and a lot of people actually hate that and they want the old blackberry cuz they want the old way.

39
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:29,166
Speaker 1: Yeah, these people had blackberries back when only rich executives and middle management people had blackberries.

40
00:02:29,187 --> 00:02:33,337
Speaker 1: It was like a status symbol and They learned about like.

41
00:02:33,377 --> 00:02:36,086
Speaker 1: they felt very powerful and very cool using this technology.

42
00:02:36,107 --> 00:02:37,130
Speaker 1: There's like ultra modern.

43
00:02:37,251 --> 00:02:40,529
Speaker 1: I'm connected all the time when most people didn't even have a normal cell phone.

44
00:02:42,071 --> 00:02:45,270
Speaker 1: Now those people are still in business.

45
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:52,476
Speaker 1: they're like the super senior executives and the CEOs and all those people the upper management and People just never change.

46
00:02:52,637 --> 00:03:05,750
Speaker 1: and because they've been using that interface for so long They're used to it and they still have this misplaced desire Like they feel like it's something worth being accustomed to kind of like the people who like to use the stupid Bloomberg terminal.

47
00:03:06,092 --> 00:03:15,450
Speaker 1: It's like the worst interface in the world, but people feel Accomplished when they learn it especially because it feels like expert knowledge when really it's just obtuse proprietary stupid.

48
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:25,111
Speaker 0: Now that is an aspect but you know even just today I was on the train from Connecticut and I heard two guys Discussing, you know, I try to Android and I try to iPhone but it just does it I can't.

49
00:03:25,633 --> 00:03:29,024
Speaker 0: I need the real keyboard so I can type real fast and it's like.

50
00:03:29,445 --> 00:03:40,250
Speaker 0: I think these people's problems Right is that they are writing tons and tons of either dude I saw sure or few really long or tons of long emails got on their black.

51
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:50,856
Speaker 1: I saw a guy on Metro North on multiple occasions back when I used to take the train who had a little Keyboard that he'd like take out of a bag and plug into his blackberry What the fuck.

52
00:03:50,937 --> 00:03:52,770
Speaker 1: and then he'd type like it was a computer.

53
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:58,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, see these people the it's like they want to write really long emails on their blackberry.

54
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:05,225
Speaker 0: The solution is don't write long emails on the blackberry Then you won't need a real keyboard and you can just call me short email.

55
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:07,869
Speaker 1: The solution is laptop.

56
00:04:09,018 --> 00:04:09,629
Speaker 1: Use a laptop.

57
00:04:10,172 --> 00:04:10,874
Speaker 0: It's like I know.

58
00:04:10,914 --> 00:04:18,057
Speaker 0: I even know that Robert coup is one of those people who has the blackberry and writes tons of emails To have the physical.

59
00:04:18,096 --> 00:04:22,750
Speaker 1: I've gotten emails from Robert coup and they're always short blackberry style emails.

60
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:23,900
Speaker 1: They're always just.

61
00:04:24,323 --> 00:04:27,795
Speaker 0: here's the point is Little punctuation as possible.

62
00:04:27,816 --> 00:04:33,139
Speaker 0: He'll tell you that he absolutely needs the physical keyboard because he you know Writes a lot of emails and needs to write him fast.

63
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,410
Speaker 1: No, I'll say I prefer the physical keyboard.

64
00:04:35,571 --> 00:04:39,746
Speaker 0: I dislike the touchscreen keyboard, but I just like the touchscreen keyboard at first.

65
00:04:39,826 --> 00:04:40,970
Speaker 0: but you get used to it, right?

66
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:41,673
Speaker 0: I'm like to it.

67
00:04:41,794 --> 00:04:43,870
Speaker 0: It's the same way as like I'm saying I'm used to it.

68
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,276
Speaker 1: But I still given the choice.

69
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:48,750
Speaker 1: I would take the physical keyboard over the digital keyboard.

70
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,132
Speaker 1: I would not.

71
00:04:49,152 --> 00:04:50,980
Speaker 0: cuz I'll take the extra screen real estate.

72
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:52,165
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could have both.

73
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:55,055
Speaker 0: keyboard could be on the back Yeah, but then it's got to be a slider.

74
00:04:55,075 --> 00:04:57,382
Speaker 1: No, I want I really like slider.

75
00:04:57,402 --> 00:04:59,167
Speaker 0: I don't like it cuz then it's fatter.

76
00:04:59,187 --> 00:05:04,225
Speaker 1: Ah My actually my pre is not fatter than most people's droids.

77
00:05:04,606 --> 00:05:06,936
Speaker 0: It's better than iPhone Not by much.

78
00:05:07,377 --> 00:05:10,330
Speaker 0: It is you'd be surprised plus it's so much curve.

79
00:05:11,636 --> 00:05:14,276
Speaker 1: The pre still yeah Less screen.

80
00:05:14,296 --> 00:05:16,082
Speaker 0: the iPhone is all screen.

81
00:05:16,162 --> 00:05:18,710
Speaker 1: It had the same resolution as the previous iPhone.

82
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,817
Speaker 0: Yeah, the retina display kicks everyone's ass.

83
00:05:20,857 --> 00:05:21,780
Speaker 0: That's just too bad.

84
00:05:22,101 --> 00:05:31,557
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, no, no, I'm not saying I like my Nexus S. But if I could have the Nexus S yet somehow also have a physical keyboard in it That did not make it heavier or thicker.

85
00:05:31,577 --> 00:05:32,780
Speaker 1: I would do that.

86
00:05:32,901 --> 00:05:34,505
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm just saying it's a preference.

87
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:36,030
Speaker 1: all things can being equal.

88
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:40,810
Speaker 0: I mean, I'll take a physical keyboard, but the problem is the trade-offs necessary for it are more important.

89
00:05:41,273 --> 00:05:49,533
Speaker 1: But anyway, it's the other problems with blackberries So that I think a lot of the people who use them are the kinds of people who want to be connected to their business All the time.

90
00:05:49,573 --> 00:05:49,673
Speaker 1: now.

91
00:05:49,714 --> 00:05:52,285
Speaker 1: some people it's because their business is their passion.

92
00:05:52,305 --> 00:05:56,042
Speaker 1: because we're talking about Robert Coo I mean if I was connected to just works all the time.

93
00:05:56,383 --> 00:05:58,030
Speaker 1: Oh, wait, I am connected to gig nights all the time.

94
00:05:58,151 --> 00:05:59,986
Speaker 1: Oh with my droid, huh?

95
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,856
Speaker 0: Which doesn't have a keyboard.

96
00:06:03,037 --> 00:06:03,278
Speaker 0: Yeah.

97
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:05,549
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I think these people too.

98
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:10,244
Speaker 1: I've watched a lot of old people interacting with phones, especially if they get a new more fancy blackberry.

99
00:06:10,846 --> 00:06:18,070
Speaker 1: they seem to Not understand or want to use any of the other features of the phone and they really want it.

100
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:22,407
Speaker 1: Just turn on and show them all their email whether or not they have an internet connection.

101
00:06:22,447 --> 00:06:23,270
Speaker 1: That's all they care about.

102
00:06:23,611 --> 00:06:26,143
Speaker 0: It's the same problem that you know, these are the same old things.

103
00:06:26,183 --> 00:06:32,010
Speaker 0: We talk about all the time like the Yeah, it's like oh the guy who needs a car, but he says who needs a car?

104
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:38,383
Speaker 0: I never left this town in my life and then you eventually force him to leave the town and he goes Oh and he realizes the whole world outside the town.

105
00:06:38,685 --> 00:06:42,510
Speaker 0: and now he absolutely Desperately needs a car because the whole world is open to him.

106
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,255
Speaker 0: They didn't know about.

107
00:06:43,296 --> 00:06:45,210
Speaker 0: he was just too stubborn to go look at the world.

108
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:47,089
Speaker 0: So he didn't know that he wanted it and needed it.

109
00:06:48,731 --> 00:06:51,330
Speaker 0: Never used those other things on their blackberries.

110
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,557
Speaker 0: They never knew they wanted them.

111
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:58,719
Speaker 0: and yet to force them to use them, you know So that they realize that it's something they want Well, like young nerds I have the opposite problem.

112
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,527
Speaker 1: if they want things that don't exist yet.

113
00:07:00,748 --> 00:07:03,869
Speaker 1: Yeah They just wait until they can afford it.

114
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,492
Speaker 1: I mean nerd.

115
00:07:04,512 --> 00:07:10,489
Speaker 1: when the blackberry first existed every nerd wanted one kind of like how you wanted a fancy palm back when there was palm.

116
00:07:11,212 --> 00:07:12,918
Speaker 1: And then you know, I got a fancy palm.

117
00:07:12,998 --> 00:07:16,550
Speaker 1: IBM gave me one and I realized five seconds in that it was useless.

118
00:07:17,155 --> 00:07:19,010
Speaker 0: Well, that was after fancy palm was no longer.

119
00:07:20,913 --> 00:07:23,068
Speaker 1: That was before cell phones.

120
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:26,842
Speaker 1: I Did not have a cell phone when I first got my palm.

121
00:07:27,545 --> 00:07:28,128
Speaker 0: That's pretty sad.

122
00:07:28,992 --> 00:07:32,951
Speaker 1: You got a cell phone around that time herself on the year 2000.

123
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:35,583
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got that palm pilot when you're already in like beacon.

124
00:07:35,884 --> 00:07:36,306
Speaker 1: No, you got.

125
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:37,090
Speaker 1: you got the phone.

126
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,698
Speaker 1: I remember we were in colony when you got it.

127
00:07:38,718 --> 00:07:40,285
Speaker 1: cuz we took it to that con.

128
00:07:40,345 --> 00:07:42,014
Speaker 0: I had it near 2000 Did you?

129
00:07:42,034 --> 00:07:42,276
Speaker 0: Yep.

130
00:07:42,739 --> 00:07:43,041
Speaker 1: All right.

131
00:07:43,061 --> 00:07:44,530
Speaker 1: So the next year I got a phone.

132
00:07:45,612 --> 00:07:47,019
Speaker 1: yeah, I think it was the only one the crew.

133
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,110
Speaker 1: because remember we went to Otacon and You had the cell phone.

134
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:59,223
Speaker 1: So we had to like call the one other person in the crew who had the cell phone that he had like a track phone Or something like the old equivalent of a track phone.

135
00:07:59,243 --> 00:07:59,404
Speaker 1: Yeah.

136
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:03,606
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway So, uh, I was really going anywhere with that.

137
00:08:03,646 --> 00:08:12,577
Speaker 1: other than that I've got an app on my droid that gives me access through some company to My enterprise blackberry stuff.

138
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:16,310
Speaker 0: So it's a blackberry enterprise - I map translation server.

139
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:22,329
Speaker 1: Well, it acts like that in terms of Michael, you know My company trusts it which is a first and a lot of big companies seem to be using this thing.

140
00:08:23,052 --> 00:08:30,734
Speaker 1: But it actually interfaces directly with our exchange server as opposed to with our blackberry enterprise The iPhone.

141
00:08:30,754 --> 00:08:37,274
Speaker 0: you can just go into the settings and enable the Cisco VPN and just connect to your company's network and then go to The exchange server directly.

142
00:08:37,294 --> 00:08:41,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, if they let you do that most companies I've seen won't let anyone even consider that.

143
00:08:41,811 --> 00:08:46,630
Speaker 0: I mean if there's I. they gave me a Cisco VPN client so I could just use the same credentials and they can't stop me.

144
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:51,776
Speaker 0: And then the iPhone is just a device that used talks to the exchange servers So they can't.

145
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,909
Speaker 0: what can they do about it?

146
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,559
Speaker 0: Yeah, then it to specifically target the iPhone and disable that.

147
00:08:55,579 --> 00:09:04,030
Speaker 0: but even though I don't actually have to do that because they enabled Active sync on the exchange server, which means I can just go to it directly from the phone and it does the pushing.

148
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:05,956
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I just have I now draw it.

149
00:09:05,996 --> 00:09:10,289
Speaker 1: I have the full integration with exchange and it's pretty great for what it is.

150
00:09:10,631 --> 00:09:16,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I use the same exact, you know, people might not know this but Gmail has a feature Gmail sync.

151
00:09:16,498 --> 00:09:21,950
Speaker 0: We're basically Google licensed the exchange server active sync technology from Microsoft.

152
00:09:22,211 --> 00:09:23,476
Speaker 0: They pay Microsoft money for this.

153
00:09:23,857 --> 00:09:27,110
Speaker 0: so Google has what appears to be exchange servers, right?

154
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:31,530
Speaker 0: They look like exchange servers as far as your phone is concerned, but really it's Gmail on the other side.

155
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:42,848
Speaker 0: So you tell your phone or whatever it is that you know connect to this exchange server at mail google.com And you get your Gmail pushed to you, you know automatically on your blackberry or whatever.

156
00:09:42,888 --> 00:09:46,490
Speaker 0: it is Gmail but it works like exchange as far as the phone knows.

157
00:09:47,693 --> 00:09:48,803
Speaker 0: And you know, that's that's always.

158
00:09:48,823 --> 00:09:49,449
Speaker 0: that's the way I go.

159
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, so my blackberry is now off in the corner and I just give it back.

160
00:09:53,331 --> 00:09:55,904
Speaker 0: It also does you know calendars and all those other things.

161
00:09:55,944 --> 00:09:56,728
Speaker 0: to contacts.

162
00:09:56,748 --> 00:10:00,090
Speaker 1: Yep I get all that the contacts didn't sync yet, but doesn't really matter.

163
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:03,692
Speaker 0: I don't think the company contacts because I don't know I use the personal contacts But I do.

164
00:10:03,752 --> 00:10:08,070
Speaker 0: I can sync the company calendar and the personal Google calendar together in the same iPhone calendar.

165
00:10:08,552 --> 00:10:12,088
Speaker 1: I want to keep mine very separate, but it's the same UI.

166
00:10:12,148 --> 00:10:13,995
Speaker 0: so it's like It's it's there.

167
00:10:14,015 --> 00:10:15,670
Speaker 0: It's still separate calendars.

168
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,576
Speaker 1: Yeah, this thing has its own.

169
00:10:16,636 --> 00:10:23,081
Speaker 0: one of the calendars is on the company's exchange server And one of the calendars is on Gmail But they're both in the same calendar app on.

170
00:10:23,101 --> 00:10:25,190
Speaker 1: this thing exists as its own standalone app.

171
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:28,409
Speaker 1: So inside of that is like all work and then I close it and no work.

172
00:10:28,951 --> 00:10:29,735
Speaker 0: I'll see I click on.

173
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:33,450
Speaker 0: you know, there's the email app but in the email app each email account is separate.

174
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:38,269
Speaker 0: So the emails aren't like shuffled together anything like that now the free they would have been but yeah.

175
00:10:39,551 --> 00:10:41,602
Speaker 1: So I do briefly want to talk about.

176
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,030
Speaker 1: we're not gonna do a show on it or anything.

177
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:47,349
Speaker 1: But well sec has been the rising star of the internet lately.

178
00:10:47,771 --> 00:10:54,230
Speaker 1: I guess so and I'm curious what's really going on because I mean look at what we had for a long time.

179
00:10:54,230 --> 00:11:01,674
Speaker 1: Remember the era of script keys when suddenly like every I don't know IIS server in the world was hacked by script kiddies Just like every day.

180
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:07,842
Speaker 1: Yep, and then things kind of calm down for a while and we've had this long era of Relative peace on the internet.

181
00:11:07,882 --> 00:11:08,870
Speaker 0: wasn't relative peace.

182
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,362
Speaker 0: I think that it was just the peace there were.

183
00:11:11,402 --> 00:11:28,953
Speaker 0: the war was not highly visible right and a lot of the people who formerly were writing viruses moved to things like spyware and the Motivations became you know switched from making mischief or hurting people or whatever to it or being cool and hacking To making money.

184
00:11:29,074 --> 00:11:39,448
Speaker 1: Oh, but simultaneously there was I think a lack of When there was low-hanging fruit like oh dude got that guy's running is three.

185
00:11:39,508 --> 00:11:41,522
Speaker 1: here I go Versus oh, it's Apache.

186
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:42,270
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna even bother.

187
00:11:42,872 --> 00:11:47,730
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you know part of it was you know, a lot of those low-hanging fruits disappeared.

188
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:53,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I think what's happened now is that it's not that lulz like is going after the low-hanging fruit.

189
00:11:53,490 --> 00:12:02,170
Speaker 1: It's that because people have been into this relative peace for a while at least this perception of perception of peace That it's all low-hanging fruit.

190
00:12:02,854 --> 00:12:12,310
Speaker 0: I mean, there's lots of low-hanging fruit because what you know Because of various technologies that make it, you know easier and easier for non-professionals to create software and set up.

191
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,809
Speaker 1: So not even that wasn't it city?

192
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:19,870
Speaker 1: I think was the one where they hacked all the accounts just by logging into one account and then changing the string in the URL.

193
00:12:20,211 --> 00:12:24,045
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean that it's because they're already on the ground.

194
00:12:24,246 --> 00:12:25,250
Speaker 1: That's not even low-hanging.

195
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,710
Speaker 1: That's like rotten on the ground being carried away by a squirrel.

196
00:12:27,771 --> 00:12:28,658
Speaker 0: But this is what I'm talking about.

197
00:12:28,678 --> 00:12:42,586
Speaker 0: is that there aren't enough You know Highly skilled and highly knowledgeable technology people in the world and there's a lot of people who are like, you know I just want to get a website up and I'm like Do you realize how many things you have to know to get the website at?

198
00:12:42,606 --> 00:12:43,530
Speaker 0: you know to put a website up?

199
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,430
Speaker 0: That's actually you know, right?

200
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,362
Speaker 0: It's it's this you have to know this vast amount of knowledge.

201
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:55,130
Speaker 0: and the thing is some guy puts up some HTMLs or does the Ruby on Rails tutorial and put something up and it feels all accomplished.

202
00:12:55,553 --> 00:12:57,850
Speaker 0: But really he's basically set up a rickety shack.

203
00:12:57,952 --> 00:12:59,973
Speaker 0: He just thinks it's a mansion You know.

204
00:12:59,993 --> 00:13:06,803
Speaker 0: to actually build a house that will stand up and not a house of cards is like this ludicrously difficult thing that not enough people can do.

205
00:13:06,823 --> 00:13:15,790
Speaker 0: but This is not a high enough number of people who can do it properly as the demand is for people who can do it and the Result is there's a whole lot of rickety shacks.

206
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:19,048
Speaker 1: But it is kind of amazing though that there it's not like.

207
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:22,078
Speaker 1: alright This is a pretty well done system that has a few fatal flaws.

208
00:13:22,118 --> 00:13:23,061
Speaker 1: Like someone was careless.

209
00:13:23,442 --> 00:13:26,010
Speaker 1: It's like I don't even know how to describe it.

210
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,698
Speaker 1: It's like they don't even try.

211
00:13:27,758 --> 00:13:30,150
Speaker 1: it's like there's no one who even has ever heard of security.

212
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:34,884
Speaker 0: It's also because the people who are the experts technologically.

213
00:13:34,904 --> 00:13:36,470
Speaker 0: we've discussed this many times, right?

214
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:46,770
Speaker 0: companies tend to either have all smart tech people or all stupid tech people because if you have a stupid person the smart people won't Hire them and if you have stupid people in charge, they'll hire stupid people.

215
00:13:46,831 --> 00:14:00,549
Speaker 0: But if any smart person gets hired there They'll bail and try to go work where smart people work and as a result You've got like Facebook with thousands and thousands of really smart tech people or Google with thousands of smart tech people and they're all You know teamed up.

216
00:14:00,751 --> 00:14:13,370
Speaker 0: It was one I was waiting for you to say a name of someone that has all stupid people All of the other ones all of them You know, you basically have the smart tech people teaming up on these huge teams at very specific places like Google.

217
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:14,093
Speaker 0: You know who's?

218
00:14:14,234 --> 00:14:17,870
Speaker 0: none of these attacks have been on Google right or Microsoft or anything like that.

219
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:18,473
Speaker 1: Well, I mean look at who.

220
00:14:18,513 --> 00:14:18,835
Speaker 1: Google.

221
00:14:18,895 --> 00:14:22,010
Speaker 1: Google got compromised by the Chinese government.

222
00:14:22,614 --> 00:14:24,122
Speaker 0: Yeah, and barely so.

223
00:14:24,142 --> 00:14:25,410
Speaker 0: but I mean Lulsec.

224
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:31,809
Speaker 1: I'm not sure what it really is because you know, there was that that anonymous like hey Let's fuck shit up video a little while ago.

225
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:36,590
Speaker 1: And yeah, I don't know Lulsec's a little too high-profile and I'm gonna put on my conspiracy hat.

226
00:14:36,911 --> 00:14:37,757
Speaker 1: We get the tinfoil.

227
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:51,181
Speaker 1: it is possible that Lulsec is a false flag operation to get all the script kiddies and all the people who self-identify as being these kinds of hackers To basically out themselves by attacking low-hanging honeypots.

228
00:14:51,582 --> 00:14:56,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know it's possible But it is possible but a lot of things are possible.

229
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:01,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time the reason I don't hold to that is that there is that much low-hanging fruit.

230
00:15:02,231 --> 00:15:07,250
Speaker 1: You know engineers always say, you know when there's a terrorist attack engineers aren't evil, but they always have the twinge.

231
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,362
Speaker 1: They think wow, I could have done that way better.

232
00:15:09,945 --> 00:15:18,403
Speaker 0: or yeah, they're lucky I'm not evil, but I think what Lulsec demonstrates is that even though you know They're getting low-hanging fruit like SQL injections or DD OS's or whatever.

233
00:15:18,443 --> 00:15:20,510
Speaker 1: Well hanging fruit works on almost everyone.

234
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:21,333
Speaker 0: Right is that?

235
00:15:21,514 --> 00:15:21,755
Speaker 0: you know?

236
00:15:21,775 --> 00:15:25,429
Speaker 0: is that even though their skill level isn't you know, isn't very high?

237
00:15:26,112 --> 00:15:38,350
Speaker 0: It's that if you even just use a modicum of security modern technologies like you use real encryption You know that doesn't suck and you put some proxies between you and your IRC server.

238
00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:44,029
Speaker 0: You can just chat about your hacks on a perfectly like public IRC and no one will ever catch you.

239
00:15:44,692 --> 00:15:47,922
Speaker 0: You know, yeah, it's like all the pedophiles do the same thing.

240
00:15:47,963 --> 00:15:50,110
Speaker 1: There's just you know, I mean look at the converse of this.

241
00:15:50,411 --> 00:15:51,134
Speaker 1: So the government.

242
00:15:51,274 --> 00:15:55,230
Speaker 1: obviously there are organizations that would like to arrest the people involved in all this internet.

243
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:59,670
Speaker 0: You know shenanigans and they can't find them even though they're doing just simple basic stuff.

244
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:04,508
Speaker 1: Occasionally they get one or two of these people and you know who they're getting the low-hanging fruit.

245
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:10,304
Speaker 0: Yeah Nobody if anyone actually does any you know uses any serious technology.

246
00:16:10,464 --> 00:16:11,327
Speaker 0: you think you can't.

247
00:16:11,608 --> 00:16:12,290
Speaker 0: no one can get you.

248
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,817
Speaker 0: It's so encrypted.

249
00:16:13,857 --> 00:16:18,718
Speaker 0: It's unbreakable and that's just available for free open source Which is behind seven proxies.

250
00:16:18,838 --> 00:16:26,630
Speaker 0: and this is why you know, this is why the government is, you know I guess governments around the world are really afraid of just if everyone used open source software, right?

251
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:33,150
Speaker 0: Like imagine if everyone abandoned Apple and Windows and everyone just started using Linux tomorrow and everyone, you know.

252
00:16:33,251 --> 00:16:36,087
Speaker 0: But GPG on their email game over.

253
00:16:37,471 --> 00:16:47,826
Speaker 0: It's like everyone in the world is so secure that it's impossible to get any information from anyone unless they want to give it To you, you know all the days of like, oh my god, my Facebook's was hacked.

254
00:16:48,228 --> 00:16:49,919
Speaker 0: Oh my god Someone stole my ex by.

255
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:55,328
Speaker 1: this is why I'm kind of enjoying low sex modus operandi because I saw what I'm following their Twitter now just to see what they're up to.

256
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:58,059
Speaker 1: but Notice how they're very pointedly.

257
00:16:58,401 --> 00:17:00,670
Speaker 0: you can have a Twitter account and not be caught.

258
00:17:02,118 --> 00:17:11,490
Speaker 1: Notice how they're going very pointedly After very easy targets and they're trying to get them in the least sophisticated way possible because that brings way more public shame.

259
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:15,630
Speaker 1: I mean if you get someone they said something like you get someone with a really complicated hack.

260
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:17,249
Speaker 1: I mean, what's the news gonna say?

261
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:24,109
Speaker 1: Super elite hackers got this company as opposed to this company was so egregiously insecure that it was ridiculous.

262
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,535
Speaker 0: But on the other hand, right?

263
00:17:25,595 --> 00:17:30,030
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, what if you walk down the street and there's two different buildings, right?

264
00:17:30,211 --> 00:17:34,890
Speaker 0: One of them is the museum and some of the fine arts and the other one is an old lady's house?

265
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:40,815
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you robbed the old lady's house, it's like yeah, good job, dude Yeah, whatever.

266
00:17:41,116 --> 00:17:46,744
Speaker 1: But if you robbed the museum, you're a total badass, ah, but they're not trying to be badasses They're trying to just shame people.

267
00:17:46,784 --> 00:17:47,330
Speaker 0: imagine, right?

268
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:56,318
Speaker 0: But at the same time they're shaming themselves because it's like, you know, obviously they're shaming people because it's like oh look You didn't even lock your door, but it's like okay, dude.

269
00:17:56,358 --> 00:17:57,202
Speaker 0: Wow, you're so great.

270
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,230
Speaker 0: You busted into a house that unlock door.

271
00:17:59,614 --> 00:18:02,696
Speaker 0: Ah, but at the same time You're awesome, dude.

272
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:08,375
Speaker 1: This is a situation where there's an entire city and Everyone in that city.

273
00:18:08,435 --> 00:18:09,479
Speaker 1: They've never heard of doors.

274
00:18:09,921 --> 00:18:15,362
Speaker 1: Yeah, so these guys just walk into the city and take everything Yeah, and then they walk out and they're like you mad it still does.

275
00:18:15,382 --> 00:18:17,928
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's you know, it's funny in that way but it's still.

276
00:18:20,751 --> 00:18:27,490
Speaker 1: My position here is that I'm curious as to whether or not the people involved in this have the ability to do the big hack.

277
00:18:27,955 --> 00:18:28,340
Speaker 0: I doubt it.

278
00:18:28,684 --> 00:18:37,896
Speaker 0: I don't know I don't think I think that anyone with the ability to do the big hack all those people who have had or have that ability currently Do not are not going.

279
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:41,790
Speaker 0: they could make more money and more with in a safer fashion.

280
00:18:41,932 --> 00:18:43,088
Speaker 0: So they don't do that for now.

281
00:18:44,555 --> 00:18:48,710
Speaker 0: Of the world who used to do the big hack don't do it any now, but what if you know?

282
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,267
Speaker 1: The government pisses them off enough.

283
00:18:51,652 --> 00:19:01,727
Speaker 0: the other thing is I don't think the big hack is possible because The people who are the targets of the big hack they use those very same encryption technologies.

284
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:04,323
Speaker 1: this in perspective I mean, what does it mean to do the big hack?

285
00:19:04,404 --> 00:19:09,869
Speaker 1: I mean, I think Considering how insecure I mean a lot of these targets are like banks and things.

286
00:19:10,672 --> 00:19:15,991
Speaker 0: Yeah, but when for example the Citibank hack they put in you know user IDs and they were able to see how much money people Had.

287
00:19:16,011 --> 00:19:17,897
Speaker 0: they couldn't actually spend or transfer any money.

288
00:19:17,937 --> 00:19:20,666
Speaker 1: So Scott to the average American that sort of.

289
00:19:20,687 --> 00:19:25,070
Speaker 1: it's not just that They can see they can manipulate too and also you're getting the passwords.

290
00:19:25,513 --> 00:19:25,976
Speaker 1: They you can.

291
00:19:26,157 --> 00:19:30,739
Speaker 1: if you find someone's password on say Facebook You probably have their password to everything else.

292
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,610
Speaker 1: They've got probably and then you can start stealing their money.

293
00:19:34,092 --> 00:19:36,324
Speaker 0: So you you got some random guy on Facebook.

294
00:19:36,364 --> 00:19:36,706
Speaker 0: good job.

295
00:19:36,746 --> 00:19:42,530
Speaker 1: That's not a big hack Yeah, but if you get everybody on Facebook that causes chaos to a degree that is unsettling.

296
00:19:42,872 --> 00:19:46,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know, but notice nobody's hacked Facebook cuz Facebook has smart people.

297
00:19:46,771 --> 00:19:49,259
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Facebook is now vulnerable to.

298
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:55,669
Speaker 1: if you have a Facebook account and you have an account anywhere else The majority of people use the same password everywhere, right?

299
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,677
Speaker 1: But it's one of those places but it doesn't.

300
00:19:57,757 --> 00:19:58,902
Speaker 0: that doesn't count.

301
00:19:58,942 --> 00:19:59,645
Speaker 0: that's that's like.

302
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,050
Speaker 0: you didn't actually hack Facebook.

303
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,054
Speaker 0: You just have to hack.

304
00:20:02,155 --> 00:20:03,521
Speaker 0: the target wasn't Facebook?

305
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:04,365
Speaker 0: target was that guy?

306
00:20:04,485 --> 00:20:05,570
Speaker 1: if you're a con man, right?

307
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:09,422
Speaker 1: If you get the million dollars, it's the big score doesn't matter.

308
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:10,104
Speaker 0: I got it.

309
00:20:10,225 --> 00:20:11,730
Speaker 0: It doesn't it's not the same.

310
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:17,570
Speaker 0: Let's say I find a thousand morons and I take advantage of those morons and you get a million dollars.

311
00:20:17,771 --> 00:20:20,299
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like yeah, but it doesn't matter how much I get.

312
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:26,154
Speaker 0: the point is all I did was the the thing that was What's it called.

313
00:20:26,174 --> 00:20:29,730
Speaker 1: I can't think of this word right now, well, I guess in that case you were separate.

314
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:30,563
Speaker 1: There's two separate things.

315
00:20:30,624 --> 00:20:36,990
Speaker 1: There's one There's the pragmatic reality of how much damage and or theft happens as a result of their action.

316
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,938
Speaker 1: You could use that as the scale is what the big hack is.

317
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,976
Speaker 1: or I thinking you're more from the Lupin The sting style.

318
00:20:43,377 --> 00:20:46,010
Speaker 1: if you're gonna pull off a heist, it doesn't matter how much you get.

319
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,837
Speaker 1: What matters is how awesome and elaborate it is.

320
00:20:47,898 --> 00:20:49,584
Speaker 0: Well, it's not about how elaborate it is.

321
00:20:49,685 --> 00:20:52,578
Speaker 0: It's that you know, okay You know you all you did.

322
00:20:52,598 --> 00:20:54,306
Speaker 0: you didn't actually hack Facebook, right?

323
00:20:54,406 --> 00:20:55,110
Speaker 0: You can't do that.

324
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,256
Speaker 0: You don't need to write.

325
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,890
Speaker 0: you hacked a bunch of morons who happen to have Facebook.

326
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:03,210
Speaker 0: It's got the more and everyone else with the Facebook account is totally say it's got the morons of the majority.

327
00:21:03,271 --> 00:21:11,730
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure if you got you know If you hacked enough sites out there like even slashdot and things you could probably compromise a majority of the Facebook account.

328
00:21:12,211 --> 00:21:14,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you didn't actually compromise Facebook.

329
00:21:14,939 --> 00:21:16,463
Speaker 0: Facebook is still solid.

330
00:21:16,804 --> 00:21:19,715
Speaker 1: Well, they're solid except for the fact that everyone's account Just got wiped right.

331
00:21:19,735 --> 00:21:20,881
Speaker 0: So so here I got it.

332
00:21:20,942 --> 00:21:22,430
Speaker 0: I got a way to explain this you ready?

333
00:21:22,891 --> 00:21:25,400
Speaker 0: So I stand outside of a bank branch.

334
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:29,656
Speaker 0: Yeah, right and everyone who walks out of the bank branch I mug them and take the money.

335
00:21:29,676 --> 00:21:32,270
Speaker 1: They just took out of the ATM and you get away with this come every day.

336
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:35,490
Speaker 0: Yes, then I but the bank is still totally secure.

337
00:21:36,052 --> 00:21:41,174
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it doesn't matter that you got your money, but the bank is just like Bank doesn't give a shit Yeah, but the customers do so.

338
00:21:41,214 --> 00:21:42,540
Speaker 1: you effectively robbed you.

339
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,343
Speaker 0: In fact, I didn't.

340
00:21:43,423 --> 00:21:45,230
Speaker 0: I compromised the customers not the bank.

341
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:48,470
Speaker 1: I didn't say you compromised the bank, which is basically it's stupid.

342
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,076
Speaker 1: I said the effect is the same.

343
00:21:50,136 --> 00:21:53,850
Speaker 1: you got your money and an equivalent amount of money was stolen from people.

344
00:21:54,193 --> 00:21:55,749
Speaker 0: Yeah from people but not from the bank.

345
00:21:56,111 --> 00:21:57,758
Speaker 1: Uh, if I steal it from the bank, I can't.

346
00:21:57,818 --> 00:22:01,633
Speaker 1: I would effectively be stealing it from the people but for the FDIC Yeah, you can't.

347
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,639
Speaker 0: the point is is you can't steal it from the bank.

348
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:04,481
Speaker 0: is who cares?

349
00:22:04,802 --> 00:22:05,785
Speaker 0: I care why?

350
00:22:06,046 --> 00:22:07,289
Speaker 0: cuz that's not the big hack.

351
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:11,149
Speaker 0: So we were just discussing whether anyone will pull off the big hack.

352
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,730
Speaker 0: Little hacks is not the big house Scott.

353
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:24,047
Speaker 1: I think we disagree on what the big hack is because for me the big hack just means something that affects So many people so significantly that no one know that's a million little hacks.

354
00:22:24,087 --> 00:22:26,141
Speaker 0: the way you're talking about It's not the big head.

355
00:22:26,161 --> 00:22:31,640
Speaker 0: I would consider that the big It doesn't matter the effect it's still it's.

356
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,025
Speaker 0: those are a million little hacks.

357
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know what the effects the same It doesn't matter.

358
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,011
Speaker 0: it's not the bit no It's not.

359
00:22:36,112 --> 00:22:39,986
Speaker 0: actually if you stole from the bank directly the effect would be completely different.

360
00:22:40,006 --> 00:22:45,967
Speaker 0: that if you stole from all those people Individually, uh, I argue now actually yeah would because think about what the bank would have to do.

361
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:49,863
Speaker 0: Scott banks How about how the money would move versus Scott?

362
00:22:49,943 --> 00:22:51,430
Speaker 0: What insurances would pay out?

363
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,794
Speaker 1: There's a lot Scott banks out.

364
00:22:52,815 --> 00:22:55,865
Speaker 1: Yeah, but in the end the same amount of economic damage is done.

365
00:22:56,347 --> 00:22:59,704
Speaker 1: not necessarily Yeah, plus banks have problems like that all the time.

366
00:22:59,744 --> 00:23:00,770
Speaker 1: They just keep it on the down low.

367
00:23:01,011 --> 00:23:05,510
Speaker 0: That's another thing is that you know who knows the big hack has probably happened a bunch of times and we just don't know.

368
00:23:05,752 --> 00:23:06,277
Speaker 1: That's I would.

369
00:23:06,297 --> 00:23:07,610
Speaker 1: then I wouldn't consider it the big hack.

370
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:07,931
Speaker 1: It only.

371
00:23:07,951 --> 00:23:13,890
Speaker 1: it's only the big hack if it affects enough people to where everybody knows what happened and everybody's affected by it.

372
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:19,420
Speaker 0: No, cuz there are big hacks that are really big that you know, you just don't know Cuz who gives a shit?

373
00:23:19,702 --> 00:23:25,911
Speaker 1: Oh, thank you But you don't know they affect if a fancy cat burglar steals a fancy diamond that isn't the hope diamond and no one's heard of it.

374
00:23:26,153 --> 00:23:27,989
Speaker 1: who gives a shit except the people who own the diamond?

375
00:23:28,009 --> 00:23:29,534
Speaker 0: a Lot of people.

376
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,719
Speaker 0: it's not makes a really good story.

377
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:32,468
Speaker 1: Yeah, but no one knows about that diamond.

378
00:23:32,508 --> 00:23:39,682
Speaker 0: No one cares It's not the back but sometimes there is the big hack and it might affect you But you don't know that it was the big hack that caused that effect right?

379
00:23:39,963 --> 00:23:45,014
Speaker 0: For example, I'm not saying this is true I know it's not but you know the big stock market dip What if that?

380
00:23:45,075 --> 00:23:47,070
Speaker 0: what if that was a big hack?

381
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,550
Speaker 0: But you don't know is a big hack because they come up with some other story, right?

382
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,730
Speaker 0: So it did have this humongous effect, you know, but I'm not saying that one.

383
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:58,952
Speaker 0: But it's just an example of something that could have been the big hack and kept on the down low Right.

384
00:23:59,032 --> 00:23:59,173
Speaker 1: Yeah.

385
00:23:59,193 --> 00:24:01,222
Speaker 1: Well, then it's the big hack and Lupin succeeded.

386
00:24:01,262 --> 00:24:04,915
Speaker 0: it affected everybody but nobody knew That it was the big hat.

387
00:24:04,935 --> 00:24:07,849
Speaker 1: Well because in every heist movie ever enough people know.

388
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,939
Speaker 0: Only the people you see on the screen know.

389
00:24:10,979 --> 00:24:12,586
Speaker 0: but though, you know, the whole world doesn't know.

390
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:13,410
Speaker 1: look at the sting.

391
00:24:13,511 --> 00:24:20,490
Speaker 0: There's like 200 people who know yeah, that's it But it's not the big, you know, the big hack you actually have to hit the bank directly.

392
00:24:20,571 --> 00:24:22,310
Speaker 0: You can't just hit the people walking out of the back.

393
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:30,589
Speaker 1: I think if I compromised 80% of Facebook's accounts by individually attacking all the users simultaneously I think that counts as the big doesn't count.

394
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:33,119
Speaker 1: Anyway, you got a little yes.

395
00:24:33,682 --> 00:24:39,688
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do have some news So people might not be paying too much attention, you know to.

396
00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:44,650
Speaker 0: you know A lot of these goings-on and you know various minutiae of the open source communities.

397
00:24:45,212 --> 00:24:49,350
Speaker 0: But basically there used to be a thing called star office which then became open office.

398
00:24:49,671 --> 00:24:54,170
Speaker 0: Right, and then, you know Oracle bought Sun and things got weird, right?

399
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:57,720
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, I've switched to using office because it is just better.

400
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,743
Speaker 0: Well, you have to pay for that.

401
00:24:58,904 --> 00:25:04,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, I use Google Docs I use I use Microsoft Office when I can get a copy of it, but I refuse to pay.

402
00:25:04,951 --> 00:25:06,249
Speaker 1: I have a copy on my work laptop.

403
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:09,072
Speaker 0: I have a copy on my work laptop and I you know But I don't.

404
00:25:09,292 --> 00:25:10,296
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna pay for one.

405
00:25:10,577 --> 00:25:16,962
Speaker 1: and I when I if I ever get to a point where I don't have access To Microsoft Office on any PC I use on a regular basis.

406
00:25:17,605 --> 00:25:18,749
Speaker 1: I think I would buy it.

407
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:19,412
Speaker 0: I would need it.

408
00:25:19,693 --> 00:25:23,066
Speaker 0: If I had a ton of money lying around I would buy it that expensive.

409
00:25:23,126 --> 00:25:24,150
Speaker 0: It's hundreds of dollars.

410
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:29,410
Speaker 0: Oh, no, it's a lot of money something that I use currently recording gig nights in Adobe Audition.

411
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:33,756
Speaker 0: I also would not pay for yeah, and then we would be doing gig nights We could have used.

412
00:25:33,816 --> 00:25:35,750
Speaker 0: we didn't use audition for a very long.

413
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:43,472
Speaker 1: Yeah, we used audacity and it kind of sounded like shit and I had to run everything through that hack audition Resound.

414
00:25:43,553 --> 00:25:46,470
Speaker 0: if we had zero dollars, he would have continued that way with no problems.

415
00:25:46,994 --> 00:25:49,110
Speaker 1: Actually, I can't get resound to work on modern computers.

416
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:51,625
Speaker 0: I'm just saying we could have continued without acid or whatever.

417
00:25:51,665 --> 00:25:52,530
Speaker 1: I probably would have given up.

418
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:55,865
Speaker 0: It was too much for you to give it up on gig nights completely without spending.

419
00:25:55,906 --> 00:25:56,830
Speaker 0: it was about your money.

420
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,941
Speaker 1: It was way too much of a pain in the ass.

421
00:25:58,961 --> 00:25:59,826
Speaker 0: You did it for years.

422
00:25:59,946 --> 00:26:06,778
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah And you say that now but you know what if you hadn't if you had no money We would be doing gig nights right now with audacity.

423
00:26:06,818 --> 00:26:08,665
Speaker 0: Maybe not guaranteed anyway.

424
00:26:08,785 --> 00:26:20,723
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay anyway Alright, so there was a lot of hubbub because you know Oracle was abandoning a lot of the projects Or they were you know converting a lot of them to be more closed or whatever.

425
00:26:20,924 --> 00:26:22,870
Speaker 1: We're suing Google for billions of dollars.

426
00:26:22,971 --> 00:26:24,485
Speaker 0: Yeah, what's a bunch of bullshit, right?

427
00:26:24,525 --> 00:26:28,509
Speaker 0: So So open office is sort of in shaky territory, right?

428
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:36,050
Speaker 0: But open office was you know Very much needed by a bunch of people where Google Docs wasn't enough for them and they didn't want to pay for Microsoft Office.

429
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,776
Speaker 0: Open office is actually really popular.

430
00:26:38,358 --> 00:26:41,550
Speaker 0: It was also like a default installed thing in many Linux distributions.

431
00:26:42,292 --> 00:26:43,616
Speaker 0: So it was shaky.

432
00:26:43,957 --> 00:26:48,250
Speaker 0: and what eventually happened was they forked it and they made LibreOffice and it's like, alright.

433
00:26:48,792 --> 00:26:52,726
Speaker 0: So the Free Software Foundation and other open source groups are like, yeah LibreOffice.

434
00:26:52,767 --> 00:26:53,650
Speaker 0: That's the real deal.

435
00:26:53,991 --> 00:26:58,170
Speaker 0: I think Ubuntu now has LibreOffice instead of OpenOffice as the default.

436
00:26:59,115 --> 00:27:00,642
Speaker 0: So LibreOffice came out and it's like, okay.

437
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:01,406
Speaker 0: Well now there's two.

438
00:27:01,466 --> 00:27:04,044
Speaker 0: this is great and OpenOffice was then.

439
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:11,650
Speaker 0: basically Oracle gave up and they gave OpenOffice to the Apache Software Foundation.

440
00:27:12,432 --> 00:27:22,000
Speaker 0: now Apache has OpenOffice and Free Software Foundation has LibreOffice, but LibreOffice has made some big moves that people may not realize.

441
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:25,430
Speaker 0: Number one, Google sort of threw their weight behind LibreOffice, right?

442
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:27,254
Speaker 0: Giving like a thumbs up.

443
00:27:27,294 --> 00:27:28,298
Speaker 0: So that helps that a lot.

444
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:36,390
Speaker 0: Two, LibreOffice just had some releases and Basically they went through the OpenOffice code and removed a whole bunch of bullshit.

445
00:27:36,551 --> 00:27:45,870
Speaker 0: Like OpenOffice is sort of notorious for being big and slow LibreOffice has cleaned it up a whole bunch and made it way smaller and not necessarily faster.

446
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:51,330
Speaker 0: But the download size is a whole bunch less and they've got ways to make it even smaller.

447
00:27:51,411 --> 00:27:52,558
Speaker 0: They're just keep working on it.

448
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:59,950
Speaker 0: So they're improving Technologically a whole bunch on OpenOffice and it's pretty much at the point now where you don't want to use OpenOffice.

449
00:28:00,072 --> 00:28:05,810
Speaker 0: You want to use LibreOffice Starting, you know today, so and there's actually two versions of it.

450
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:14,495
Speaker 0: there's the the stable version which they say is like use this if you're you know need stability like in an enterprise or your company and The sort of yellow beta.

451
00:28:14,636 --> 00:28:15,941
Speaker 0: ish, you know use this.

452
00:28:16,122 --> 00:28:22,346
Speaker 0: it has more of the work, you know fancy work We've done but isn't as tested version which you can use in your home computer.

453
00:28:22,687 --> 00:28:23,450
Speaker 0: Probably just fine.

454
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,403
Speaker 0: It'll actually probably a little bit faster and smaller.

455
00:28:25,463 --> 00:28:29,759
Speaker 1: Yeah, then the Are you anytime I'm doing anything substantial.

456
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:31,785
Speaker 1: I'm writing more than a few paragraphs.

457
00:28:32,327 --> 00:28:33,470
Speaker 1: I use Microsoft Office.

458
00:28:33,932 --> 00:28:35,558
Speaker 0: I don't have Microsoft Office.

459
00:28:35,659 --> 00:28:36,402
Speaker 0: I use Google Docs.

460
00:28:36,422 --> 00:28:37,627
Speaker 1: Yeah for everything else.

461
00:28:37,707 --> 00:28:38,330
Speaker 1: I use Google Docs.

462
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:43,374
Speaker 0: The reason the only reason I have LibreOffice at all right for the you know Cuz when am I gonna use it?

463
00:28:43,776 --> 00:28:47,530
Speaker 0: is like if I download an XLS file on a computer?

464
00:28:48,151 --> 00:28:57,076
Speaker 0: For or something like that and I don't have Microsoft Office Google Docs, but huge limitations on it And it sucks balls.

465
00:28:57,217 --> 00:29:02,659
Speaker 0: if Google Docs ever gets to the point where it's like has parity with Excel Then I probably won't need to install Libre.

466
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:10,063
Speaker 1: my trouble is Google Docs typing is okay Yeah, but the spreadsheet just really does not do what I.

467
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:18,990
Speaker 0: there's also a couple times you get a PPT file And I don't have Microsoft Office on that computer because those I just import into Google, but they don't always come out exactly.

468
00:29:19,953 --> 00:29:22,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like sometimes you just want to double-click it and open it.

469
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,358
Speaker 0: Maybe I'm not online you know.

470
00:29:24,821 --> 00:29:25,143
Speaker 0: so it's.

471
00:29:25,243 --> 00:29:28,701
Speaker 0: I don't use it like heavily But it's you gotta have it on that computer.

472
00:29:28,761 --> 00:29:30,389
Speaker 0: cuz that one or two times you're gonna need it.

473
00:29:30,711 --> 00:29:31,539
Speaker 0: You're gonna be like fuck.

474
00:29:31,822 --> 00:29:36,210
Speaker 1: actually on my laptop I use Abby word just because yeah every word works if you want to do word processing.

475
00:29:36,432 --> 00:29:42,484
Speaker 0: But I actually do pretty much everything in VIM Yeah, or the WordPress editor or Google Docs or what you know whatever.

476
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:43,929
Speaker 1: so I got one more a little bit.

477
00:29:44,652 --> 00:29:56,330
Speaker 1: So Sarah Palin we're gonna skip all the politics not going to express any opinion on her Or anything related to that, but there was a Freedom of Information Act request to get all of her official emails years ago.

478
00:29:56,992 --> 00:30:00,884
Speaker 1: It took over a thousand days for this to be complied with and the state.

479
00:30:00,904 --> 00:30:01,586
Speaker 0: I don't know why.

480
00:30:01,827 --> 00:30:02,830
Speaker 0: how could it take a thousand days?

481
00:30:04,653 --> 00:30:13,430
Speaker 1: So the state of Alaska when people first put these queries in said that it would cost almost 15 million dollars for them to provide the email.

482
00:30:14,092 --> 00:30:17,162
Speaker 1: Really that is how much it would cost them to get it all together.

483
00:30:17,242 --> 00:30:18,406
Speaker 0: and whoever said that?

484
00:30:18,446 --> 00:30:21,759
Speaker 0: who said that was stupid because it Would take about five minutes and zero dollars?

485
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:23,265
Speaker 1: not so in the end.

486
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:24,350
Speaker 1: Here's what happened.

487
00:30:24,751 --> 00:30:33,257
Speaker 1: They eventually came down and agreed that it would cost seven hundred and twenty five dollars and ninety seven cents plus shipping To get the archive.

488
00:30:33,658 --> 00:30:35,105
Speaker 0: that well plus shipping.

489
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:35,326
Speaker 0: how?

490
00:30:35,346 --> 00:30:36,210
Speaker 0: what do you mean plus shipping?

491
00:30:37,251 --> 00:30:38,268
Speaker 0: Sending you a hard drive.

492
00:30:39,732 --> 00:30:44,850
Speaker 1: They're sending you 250 pounds of printed out fucking email.

493
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:45,754
Speaker 0: Oh, you know why?

494
00:30:45,814 --> 00:30:49,370
Speaker 0: because it's an FOIA request and those always get you just get paper.

495
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,277
Speaker 0: I've done those before.

496
00:30:50,297 --> 00:30:50,780
Speaker 0: you know why?

497
00:30:50,861 --> 00:30:51,969
Speaker 1: no here's what bothers me.

498
00:30:52,832 --> 00:31:00,590
Speaker 1: They actually from what I can gather had to dump them into a digital form first turn them into PDFs and then print them.

499
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:03,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, and yet they would not give anyone the digital copies.

500
00:31:04,012 --> 00:31:09,089
Speaker 0: I think the FOIA actually law requires paper to be sent which one is right.

501
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:12,464
Speaker 0: well No, because think about this right what if I'm a person?

502
00:31:13,187 --> 00:31:18,076
Speaker 0: I'm an old lady I don't have a computer or anything and I may I say I send in a paper Request.

503
00:31:18,237 --> 00:31:20,610
Speaker 1: paper should be available as an option.

504
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:25,550
Speaker 1: I feel like the only reason they don't offer digital because it would save everybody money.

505
00:31:26,137 --> 00:31:27,069
Speaker 1: It would save them money.

506
00:31:27,411 --> 00:31:31,969
Speaker 1: It would save the people requesting money if they only gave you paper if you asked for it.

507
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:40,510
Speaker 1: Yeah I think the reason they don't change anything and the reason they give the stuff on paper is Because it makes it a pain in the ass to actually request anything.

508
00:31:41,212 --> 00:31:44,190
Speaker 0: No, because they were doing it on paper before there was even digital.

509
00:31:44,351 --> 00:31:49,790
Speaker 1: Yes, and now that they can do digital they pointedly do not do digital and no one is trying to change this.

510
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,574
Speaker 0: It's not it's just.

511
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:51,760
Speaker 0: that's just what the law is.

512
00:31:52,002 --> 00:31:52,866
Speaker 0: That's what the law says.

513
00:31:52,927 --> 00:31:55,039
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure I don't know if that's it or not.

514
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,910
Speaker 1: And the thing is alright, they provide the paper.

515
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:57,814
Speaker 0: They're just following the law.

516
00:31:57,834 --> 00:32:00,949
Speaker 1: They could also provide the digital at no cost to anyone.

517
00:32:00,989 --> 00:32:01,940
Speaker 1: yet They choose not to.

518
00:32:02,223 --> 00:32:02,750
Speaker 0: I think the law.

519
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:15,570
Speaker 1: I think the law says they just send a real copy and I think you would need to change the FOIA Lawyer, I'm saying obviously I'm pretty sure regardless of what the law says There is no prohibition from giving the digital version as well.

520
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:20,129
Speaker 0: No But no what government worker is gonna do something that is not required by law?

521
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:24,988
Speaker 0: I think they're gonna go the extra mile to do something extra that the law doesn't say they have to do.

522
00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:25,490
Speaker 0: that's never gonna.

523
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,032
Speaker 0: Well everything

524
00:32:26,072 --> 00:32:49,796
Speaker 1: I've read about this story and other freedom of information requests in the last decade or so seems to indicate that Recently like in the last few years people have been flooding this office to a degree that they've never been prepared to handle and A lot of people suggest I'm starting to agree with this that they want to keep it paper Because that just slows down the flow of information out Heavily and the only

525
00:32:49,816 --> 00:32:53,610
Speaker 0: yeah, but I'm that that may be true now, but the point that wasn't the original intent.

526
00:32:53,831 --> 00:32:54,916
Speaker 0: I didn't say it was.

527
00:32:55,237 --> 00:32:56,403
Speaker 0: I didn't even imply that.

528
00:32:56,825 --> 00:33:01,225
Speaker 1: so instead they shipped Twenty four thousand one hundred ninety nine pages of emails.

529
00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:12,410
Speaker 1: and Coolly enough the Sunlight Foundation Which basically exists to shed light on fraud and government and be open about government.

530
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:18,892
Speaker 1: I should join them set up a huge thing and scan them all in and put them all online in a digital format almost Immediately.

531
00:33:18,912 --> 00:33:19,454
Speaker 0: there you go.

532
00:33:20,056 --> 00:33:20,397
Speaker 0: I got it.

533
00:33:20,418 --> 00:33:21,963
Speaker 0: Whatever they are guys send us some money.

534
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:23,930
Speaker 0: Sunlight Foundation Sunlight Foundation.

535
00:33:24,031 --> 00:33:25,910
Speaker 0: Let me go give them a donation.

536
00:33:33,222 --> 00:33:35,030
Speaker 1: So things of the day.

537
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:37,220
Speaker 1: have you ever heard of a ganbach?

538
00:33:38,523 --> 00:33:40,940
Speaker 1: Fuck no, it's alright stupid.

539
00:33:41,101 --> 00:33:56,839
Speaker 1: I hate pronunciation things because Wikipedia is like a ganbach Which is G O with two dots over at MBO with two dots over at C pronounced ganbachs in Hungarian, but it's O's with lines through them and a note before the G.

540
00:33:58,105 --> 00:34:01,879
Speaker 0: Let's just call it Ganbach in English.

541
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:09,126
Speaker 1: Okay is a complex three-dimensional homogeneous body and It has an orientation.

542
00:34:09,306 --> 00:34:09,851
Speaker 0: So it's a shape.

543
00:34:10,072 --> 00:34:10,253
Speaker 1: Yes.

544
00:34:10,313 --> 00:34:11,520
Speaker 1: It's a shape with an orientation.

545
00:34:11,641 --> 00:34:18,694
Speaker 1: Okay, no matter how you set it down No matter what amount of force you set it down with on a flat surface.

546
00:34:18,714 --> 00:34:20,659
Speaker 1: It will always have the same orient.

547
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,106
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know I've seen those before.

548
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:25,438
Speaker 0: I just didn't know that that was what that was a very particular and specific shape.

549
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:29,513
Speaker 1: now Many things that look like they're ganbachs are not there are.

550
00:34:29,592 --> 00:34:31,500
Speaker 0: but the thing is there are more than one ganbach.

551
00:34:31,601 --> 00:34:32,437
Speaker 0: There's bunches of them.

552
00:34:33,581 --> 00:34:35,155
Speaker 0: It's not like there's only one ganbach.

553
00:34:35,175 --> 00:34:35,739
Speaker 0: There's quite a few.

554
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:41,620
Speaker 1: Well, it says specifically here that there is one particular shape and there are other things that are like this shape.

555
00:34:42,004 --> 00:34:42,795
Speaker 1: There's a whole bunch of math.

556
00:34:42,856 --> 00:34:43,139
Speaker 1: I don't know.

557
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:48,400
Speaker 0: So a ganbach is one of those things that always writes itself because I've seen like two or three of them.

558
00:34:48,527 --> 00:34:58,180
Speaker 1: Okay There's one particular design that most are manufactured as because they're very difficult to manufacture Mmm, well, I mean, I'm sure it's very difficult to make a perfect one, right?

559
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:01,199
Speaker 0: But if you go to like science museum gift shops, you'll find quite a few.

560
00:35:01,581 --> 00:35:04,271
Speaker 1: Apparently the cheapest one anyone can find online is like 170 pounds.

561
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:04,752
Speaker 1: Well, it's to buy.

562
00:35:07,783 --> 00:35:09,780
Speaker 0: I've seen like, you know little gimmicky plastic things.

563
00:35:10,761 --> 00:35:12,167
Speaker 1: Let me finish most things.

564
00:35:12,207 --> 00:35:18,412
Speaker 1: you see that purport to be ganbachs are actually weighted Part of its heavier than another part to make it work.

565
00:35:18,793 --> 00:35:27,379
Speaker 1: a real one does not equally dense uniformly dense Yet, it still always writes itself.

566
00:35:28,486 --> 00:35:30,640
Speaker 0: I have seen those also, but I did okay.

567
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:36,300
Speaker 1: But now apparently turtles have shapes that resemble ganbachs and that's why it's easy for them to flip themselves back over.

568
00:35:36,681 --> 00:35:39,269
Speaker 1: Yep, there are two pictures of turtles in this Wikipedia article.

569
00:35:39,811 --> 00:35:44,265
Speaker 1: I just learned about ganbachs like 20 minutes ago So I thought I'd share this with you.

570
00:35:44,285 --> 00:35:45,229
Speaker 0: All right.

571
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:45,650
Speaker 1: Yep.

572
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:56,760
Speaker 1: They're an infinite number of ganbachs theoretically Yeah, but there's one particular one that appears to be the one that is made for people to buy For a hundred dollars hundred and sixty nine euro.

573
00:35:56,941 --> 00:36:01,435
Speaker 0: I suggest getting the weighted plastic thing from the museum gift shop and It's good enough.

574
00:36:01,496 --> 00:36:01,660
Speaker 1: quote.

575
00:36:01,741 --> 00:36:06,940
Speaker 1: They may look like they were knocked together in a toy shop But the different angles and proportions have to be measured to within ten microns.

576
00:36:07,841 --> 00:36:13,724
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can get one that's a little less than ten microns and it'll work ninety nine percent of the time Really?

577
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:16,556
Speaker 0: It'll be really fun when you get it in one of those positions where it doesn't work.

578
00:36:16,616 --> 00:36:19,506
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, so here's a video.

579
00:36:19,547 --> 00:36:21,678
Speaker 0: I thought I did a thing of the day with this already, but I guess it didn't.

580
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:27,800
Speaker 0: It's a video called three-way street and basically Let me read the little description here on Vimeo.

581
00:36:28,781 --> 00:36:40,658
Speaker 0: By summer 2010 the expansion of bike lanes in New York City opposed a clash of long-standing bad habits such as pedestrians jaywalking Cyclists running red lights and motorists plowing through crosswalks by focusing on one intersection.

582
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:46,060
Speaker 0: as a case study My video aims to show our interconnection and shared role in improving the safety and usability of our streets.

583
00:36:46,483 --> 00:36:48,660
Speaker 0: The video is part of a longer campaign called three-way street.

584
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:59,840
Speaker 0: So in this video, basically, he picks one intersection in New York City and he shows you over the course of a day All the different times that basically bad news happened, right?

585
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:08,712
Speaker 0: Most of it is cyclists who just completely ignore all traffic laws completely except ours are pretty bad, too Though the cars are pretty bad and the pedestrians are also pretty bad.

586
00:37:08,732 --> 00:37:10,780
Speaker 0: It's basically pretty bad on everybody.

587
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:26,500
Speaker 0: So you've got like a guy one guy's jaywalking and there's a car that went right into the crosswalk And as a cyclist going the wrong way down the road all at the same time and the cyclist goes right in between the pedestrian Jaywalking and the car creeping in there, right and you know, it's basically constantly like this.

588
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:32,112
Speaker 0: I bike to work almost every day when it doesn't rain and I can And this is exactly what it's like.

589
00:37:32,193 --> 00:37:40,480
Speaker 0: if you watch this video You pretty much get a perfect sense of what it's like to bike to need to work in the New York City Except for when you're on the bridge then it's just straight.

590
00:37:40,821 --> 00:37:51,900
Speaker 1: It seems to just come down to the fact that the majority people who are on bikes in the city are gigantic douche nozzles and Cars even you know, basically are forced to be douche nozzles by the other cars, right?

591
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:59,470
Speaker 0: like if you're in a car and you never turn on red and stop before the Intersection and never block never go across and when you're attempting you'll

592
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:03,541
Speaker 1: get to 42nd Street unless in Lexington have and never progress beyond that And you

593
00:38:03,561 --> 00:38:08,360
Speaker 0: get you'll get honked at if you don't say go out and block the box or do other illegal things, right?

594
00:38:09,717 --> 00:38:11,369
Speaker 0: Or There's all sorts of stuff.

595
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,600
Speaker 1: Hey, I used to work in the Bronx.

596
00:38:13,462 --> 00:38:16,711
Speaker 0: I at one point or like if you don't double park, you'll just never park.

597
00:38:16,892 --> 00:38:19,760
Speaker 1: I at one point drove on the sidewalk.

598
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,543
Speaker 0: Yep I've seen that happen

599
00:38:21,703 --> 00:38:29,270
Speaker 1: and I did it because everyone else was doing it and it was the only way to get to the entrance ramp To the freeway that I was trying to get on to basically

600
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:37,480
Speaker 0: if everyone followed all the rules all the time You would have almost permanent gridlock, but at the same time when people don't follow the rules, right?

601
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,612
Speaker 0: It's like we've gone, you know, there's like a balance right?

602
00:38:39,673 --> 00:38:40,960
Speaker 1: Well, there's two sets of rules.

603
00:38:41,241 --> 00:38:43,308
Speaker 1: There's a new there's a real set of rules.

604
00:38:43,368 --> 00:38:44,030
Speaker 1: Then there's the laws.

605
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:48,580
Speaker 1: for example jaywalking in my opinion is 100% Okay, you should be able to jaywalk anytime you want.

606
00:38:48,709 --> 00:38:49,281
Speaker 0: Yeah There's lots.

607
00:38:49,301 --> 00:38:52,652
Speaker 0: there's no point in just standing there when there's a completely empty road and not cross.

608
00:38:52,692 --> 00:39:02,392
Speaker 1: but if you enter the street when you Do not have the right away and you're entering the street Causes anyone else to have to alter their path.

609
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,258
Speaker 1: you are sir are a douche nozzle.

610
00:39:04,358 --> 00:39:06,747
Speaker 0: Yep I don't know.

611
00:39:06,767 --> 00:39:08,639
Speaker 0: I like the term douche as opposed to the douche bag.

612
00:39:09,101 --> 00:39:12,273
Speaker 1: douche nozzle because a douche bag all the douche is like in them.

613
00:39:12,313 --> 00:39:15,819
Speaker 1: like they're a bag of douche and if you interact with The nozzle is where the douche comes out.

614
00:39:15,988 --> 00:39:21,288
Speaker 1: Yeah But the douche bag if you interact with them you might get douche on you But the douche is mostly they're a douche.

615
00:39:21,308 --> 00:39:21,850
Speaker 1: you can avoid them.

616
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:24,300
Speaker 1: the douche nozzles are spraying their douche all over everyone else.

617
00:39:27,261 --> 00:39:30,990
Speaker 0: But yeah watch this video and you'll get an idea of what it's like, you know.

618
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,629
Speaker 0: So there's thousands of intersections in the city.

619
00:39:37,749 --> 00:39:42,085
Speaker 0: most of the outer boroughs ones are not all as bad as this but many of them Are this.

620
00:39:42,226 --> 00:39:44,820
Speaker 0: there's a few thousand intersections that are this bad?

621
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:53,013
Speaker 0: Almost all the time and at night, you know and on weekends It's a little easier but tourists make it a little bit worse.

622
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:54,718
Speaker 0: and you know, it varies.

623
00:39:54,819 --> 00:40:04,736
Speaker 1: obviously This is very similar to I didn't use it to think of the day But there's this video someone sent me of and I think it was on College Humor later the guy Who got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane, which wasn't.

624
00:40:04,756 --> 00:40:06,484
Speaker 1: this is not illegal Yeah, not even a law.

625
00:40:06,544 --> 00:40:17,606
Speaker 1: but so to protest this because he was out of the bike lane because it was blocked He rode around the bike lane ramming into anything that was in the bike lane people cars Trash bins any.

626
00:40:17,686 --> 00:40:20,980
Speaker 0: I think really what we need to do is there are certain violations, right?

627
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:24,394
Speaker 0: That could be ticketed with almost 100% enforcement, right?

628
00:40:26,861 --> 00:40:31,166
Speaker 0: But they're not pretty much ever enforced You know, at least very rarely enforced.

629
00:40:31,247 --> 00:40:35,019
Speaker 0: and I think if we enforce them and the penalties were severe, right?

630
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:40,360
Speaker 1: I'm talking about like thousands of players a good example outside of my building right is the approach to the Queen Queensboro Bridge.

631
00:40:40,621 --> 00:40:46,298
Speaker 1: Yeah, and occasionally as in every goddamn day, there are cops directing traffic because the traffic lights are not time.

632
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:46,888
Speaker 1: very well Yeah.

633
00:40:47,401 --> 00:41:00,680
Speaker 1: So occasionally the cops will stop traffic on the approach to the bridge to let other people go by While the light is green which causes everyone Waiting to honk their horns, even though honking your horn is illegal on that Street.

634
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,128
Speaker 0: Yeah, they could have one more cop right.

635
00:41:03,188 --> 00:41:05,114
Speaker 1: basically just write $350 tickets to 100 people every 10 minutes.

636
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:11,880
Speaker 0: He could just stand amongst the cars and anyone who honks just slap a ticket on the window.

637
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,980
Speaker 0: I think part of the problem is that to write a ticket is actually it's kind of weird, right?

638
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:21,840
Speaker 0: If a cop has to write a ticket He has to get your license and registration and your insurance card and talk to you and waste a bunch of time.

639
00:41:22,701 --> 00:41:27,718
Speaker 0: Right, but but they have in many places and they're totally legal.

640
00:41:27,758 --> 00:41:34,040
Speaker 1: they have Red light cameras, but those are starting to be torn down or because they're not economical.

641
00:41:34,642 --> 00:41:38,897
Speaker 1: Also because some places where there's referendums able to be passed though.

642
00:41:38,918 --> 00:41:39,600
Speaker 0: They got rid of them.

643
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,750
Speaker 1: There have been referendums to get rid of them even right towns.

644
00:41:41,871 --> 00:41:43,137
Speaker 0: one, but I'm saying is that they weren't.

645
00:41:43,157 --> 00:41:44,785
Speaker 0: they are legal So it is possible.

646
00:41:44,805 --> 00:41:48,180
Speaker 0: an easy pass lane can give you a ticket for running a toll just with the camera.

647
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,006
Speaker 1: Simultaneously there is that technology.

648
00:41:51,026 --> 00:41:54,340
Speaker 1: this was from like two decades ago, but I remember seeing a cool demonstration of it.

649
00:41:54,702 --> 00:42:01,480
Speaker 1: It was a sniper finder where you set up this system And if a gunshot goes off three spotlights immediately aim it where the gunshot came from.

650
00:42:01,881 --> 00:42:04,473
Speaker 0: I think what we need is a balance between those two things.

651
00:42:04,653 --> 00:42:15,000
Speaker 0: give cops a special camera where they take a picture of a car and they get the license plate in the picture and then a menu comes up and they Enter the violation and then the ticket is mailed.

652
00:42:15,403 --> 00:42:17,660
Speaker 0: So a cop could stand amongst the parked.

653
00:42:17,861 --> 00:42:19,527
Speaker 0: you know the cars that are honking their horns.

654
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:23,651
Speaker 0: take a picture of the cars that honk with this camera and then Touch the button.

655
00:42:23,671 --> 00:42:24,460
Speaker 0: This is honk the horn.

656
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:31,254
Speaker 0: We could just have a camera a camera that just takes pictures of honking cars But that would run into the same problems as the red light camera.

657
00:42:31,274 --> 00:42:32,480
Speaker 0: That's why I'm saying we had need to balance.

658
00:42:32,802 --> 00:42:41,240
Speaker 1: I except imagine except it's almost all cabbies who are honking and The people who live in the area who would actually get to vote or interact with our government.

659
00:42:42,523 --> 00:42:43,870
Speaker 1: No, cuz all the cabbies don't live right here.

660
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:45,096
Speaker 1: they get their cabs fixed right here.

661
00:42:45,116 --> 00:42:45,659
Speaker 1: they don't live here.

662
00:42:46,725 --> 00:42:47,580
Speaker 1: They live slightly further.

663
00:42:47,621 --> 00:42:51,400
Speaker 0: But imagine it for example Let's say there's a street and everyone's double parked in the whole street.

664
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,420
Speaker 0: The cop is too lazy to walk down the street riding a ticket for every frickin car.

665
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,865
Speaker 0: But imagine if you could just go Manhattan.

666
00:42:56,885 --> 00:42:58,190
Speaker 1: they do sometimes.

667
00:42:58,331 --> 00:43:01,314
Speaker 0: but imagine if a cop all I had to do was go picture picture picture picture.

668
00:43:01,822 --> 00:43:05,339
Speaker 1: There's a line of delivery trucks parked on 41st Street every day.

669
00:43:05,802 --> 00:43:07,490
Speaker 1: Every one of them every day gets a new ticket.

670
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:09,057
Speaker 1: one of them has like a hundred tickets on it.

671
00:43:09,318 --> 00:43:12,160
Speaker 1: Nice And I don't think anyone ever pays those tickets.

672
00:43:12,521 --> 00:43:13,405
Speaker 0: Well, that's another thing.

673
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:17,520
Speaker 0: right is that they should make the penalties much more severe, right?

674
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,271
Speaker 0: And I mean there's something to be said for punishment fitting the crime.

675
00:43:20,291 --> 00:43:22,680
Speaker 0: You don't want to be like double parked death.

676
00:43:23,162 --> 00:43:24,987
Speaker 0: That would be bad obviously or jail.

677
00:43:25,008 --> 00:43:26,091
Speaker 0: that would also be bad right.

678
00:43:26,131 --> 00:43:32,960
Speaker 1: death would really only be for say if you're riding a fixie Without breaks right but it's like they do give you know, some pretty high fines.

679
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:44,320
Speaker 0: It's like passing a school bus on the wrong side when the stoplight is out is like 350 450 dollars Which is pretty big but it's not so big that it you know is like devastating, right?

680
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:50,058
Speaker 0: So people still kind of do it and the enforcement rate isn't so high so people still kind of do it.

681
00:43:50,199 --> 00:44:06,047
Speaker 0: What if Almost every time you double park like 99% of the time you got a ticket and the ticket was $2,000 you would see double parking fucking disappear real quick because pretty much everyone would make the mistake once and $2,000 later they would stop.

682
00:44:06,287 --> 00:44:07,893
Speaker 1: Ah, but thus the secondary problem.

683
00:44:08,113 --> 00:44:12,477
Speaker 0: people double park because there just isn't enough parking I know and it would just be tough shit.

684
00:44:12,497 --> 00:44:14,126
Speaker 0: Don't park Yeah, that's trouble.

685
00:44:14,166 --> 00:44:18,287
Speaker 1: when there's more people who live in an area with cars, you know You know who would love this?

686
00:44:18,769 --> 00:44:25,314
Speaker 0: me people who own parking garages Yeah, and I the thing is parking garages don't charge nearly enough as much as they should.

687
00:44:25,816 --> 00:44:27,000
Speaker 0: parking garages charge way more.

688
00:44:27,703 --> 00:44:28,387
Speaker 1: Well, it depends.

689
00:44:28,428 --> 00:44:30,399
Speaker 1: I mean the economics of it works out well right now.

690
00:44:31,521 --> 00:44:45,516
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's only because a lot of the places where there are parking garages I figured that I learned this the reason that there's often a parking garage on a spot is because Something about the land in that spot made it so that you couldn't build anything else there.

691
00:44:46,359 --> 00:44:51,580
Speaker 0: So Like people wanted to build a building but they couldn't parking garage is the only thing that you're allowed to build there.

692
00:44:51,701 --> 00:44:52,163
Speaker 0: So they did.

693
00:44:52,726 --> 00:44:55,140
Speaker 1: So anyway, very briefly in the meta moment Connecticut is coming up.

694
00:44:55,261 --> 00:44:56,028
Speaker 1: You should check that out.

695
00:44:56,048 --> 00:44:59,446
Speaker 1: if you're anywhere near Connecticut We're gonna be at the penny arcade Expo.

696
00:44:59,486 --> 00:45:00,551
Speaker 1: we might be at PAX dev.

697
00:45:00,571 --> 00:45:02,620
Speaker 1: the book club book is Isaac Abazov's foundation.

698
00:45:03,461 --> 00:45:08,539
Speaker 1: The unofficial book club book is all of the Prince of Nothing books by our Scott backer and that's about it.

699
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:11,272
Speaker 1: Yep, nothing big coming on other than that.

700
00:45:11,332 --> 00:45:24,439
Speaker 1: It's summer and Radio free Equestria will move to a Wednesday upload schedule instead of a Sunday upload schedule Because I realized that if I put it up Sunday night people can't watch it at work on Monday And I actually got a lot of complaints about that.

701
00:45:25,341 --> 00:45:28,860
Speaker 0: This weekend Saturday and Sunday is game hack day in New York City.

702
00:45:29,041 --> 00:45:30,387
Speaker 0: I think it's a General Assembly.

00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:41,717
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's game hack day org.

706
00:45:43,284 --> 00:45:44,999
Speaker 0: You have to register but it doesn't cost anything.

707
00:45:46,023 --> 00:45:52,805
Speaker 0: You can also register just to come on Sunday, which is where you only See the demos right.

708
00:45:52,885 --> 00:45:54,650
Speaker 0: so the schedule is like doors open.

709
00:45:54,711 --> 00:46:10,146
Speaker 0: hacking begins 10 a.m.. On Saturday 8 p.m As a party you hack overnight you still hack overnight, and then at noon on Sunday you register to show your demo Although red demo registration closes, and then at 2 o'clock on Sunday We start showing demos.

710
00:46:10,186 --> 00:46:13,860
Speaker 0: if you just want to see the demos of things people hacked you can come at 2 on Sunday.

711
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:25,726
Speaker 0: But if you want to work on a game, it's from 9 a.m.. Saturday to 2 p.m.. Sunday, so It's sure to be a fun time sure to see a bunch of people Making cool new interesting.

712
00:46:25,987 --> 00:46:27,874
Speaker 0: You know minigames and things like that.

713
00:46:28,034 --> 00:46:29,580
Speaker 0: There's gonna be a bunch of game Duinos there.

714
00:46:29,801 --> 00:46:31,210
Speaker 0: I think the game do you know guys coming?

715
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:34,739
Speaker 0: I got to talk to him because my game Do you know doesn't fit on top of my ether shield?

716
00:46:35,964 --> 00:46:36,758
Speaker 0: Even though he said it would.

717
00:46:37,983 --> 00:46:40,298
Speaker 1: so What do we do about DNS?

718
00:46:42,161 --> 00:46:48,080
Speaker 1: It's it's starting to become problematic because as a pedant I disagree with all the changes that have been coming lately.

719
00:46:48,221 --> 00:46:49,628
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you know I can.

720
00:46:49,689 --> 00:46:52,402
Speaker 0: when they started out was doing good stuff You know.

721
00:46:52,562 --> 00:46:55,813
Speaker 0: as far as not you know it wasn't very sign anymore.

722
00:46:55,873 --> 00:46:59,648
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, but more recently They've been starting some bad news.

723
00:46:59,668 --> 00:47:02,020
Speaker 1: It's like the sellout just started happening all at once.

724
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:04,639
Speaker 1: I mean, I think dot brand name T.

725
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:17,700
Speaker 0: You should go and look and see like if they if they change if the people on the icon board changed And that may be instigated these you know they're like there was some borderline between the period of good decisions and bad decisions.

726
00:47:18,124 --> 00:47:19,860
Speaker 0: There was a changing of the guard we didn't hear about.

727
00:47:20,261 --> 00:47:32,017
Speaker 1: I mean doesn't help that the majority of users of the internet and people who are like creators of the internet pretty much immediately gave up on DNS as it was designed and everything became.

728
00:47:32,037 --> 00:47:38,200
Speaker 1: you know it was kind of like this Binomial nomenclature like it was like something about something and no one used like proper subdomaining.

729
00:47:38,462 --> 00:47:39,288
Speaker 1: I mean no.

730
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:47,720
Speaker 1: imagine a world when it was cats Dot org and then there was something dot cats dot org something dot something dot something dot cats dot org.

731
00:47:48,081 --> 00:47:49,526
Speaker 0: You know why do the first wet?

732
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:53,380
Speaker 0: a lot of the problem is that the vast majority of DNS is used for the web even?

733
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,673
Speaker 0: Though it's used for other things as well.

734
00:47:54,693 --> 00:47:58,329
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, why did web browsers the like mosaic?

735
00:47:58,369 --> 00:48:01,720
Speaker 0: I guess why did they put the domains backwards in the first place?

736
00:48:02,204 --> 00:48:04,385
Speaker 1: Oh, that's how the spec was Really?

737
00:48:04,425 --> 00:48:05,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's just how it was kind of designed.

738
00:48:06,241 --> 00:48:10,713
Speaker 0: It's like because they could have made the original browsers do com dot whatever right.

739
00:48:10,994 --> 00:48:11,655
Speaker 1: well you can think of.

740
00:48:11,756 --> 00:48:15,107
Speaker 1: I mean imagine reading it As though the dots are ads.

741
00:48:15,167 --> 00:48:18,280
Speaker 1: so I'm going to www at cats at calm.

742
00:48:19,145 --> 00:48:19,897
Speaker 1: Then it makes sense.

743
00:48:20,682 --> 00:48:25,077
Speaker 1: Yeah, because it's the www server at cats and but it's not a dot.

744
00:48:25,117 --> 00:48:28,520
Speaker 0: but I think of it this way What if the URL said org cats dot?

745
00:48:28,961 --> 00:48:29,362
Speaker 0: Www?

746
00:48:29,784 --> 00:48:33,015
Speaker 0: then things like the up button would sort of make sense, right?

747
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:33,737
Speaker 0: You could go up.

748
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:35,844
Speaker 1: Oh wait Wait, you mean like usenet?

749
00:48:36,325 --> 00:48:48,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, right exactly what I'm saying dot furry dot porn dot more porn exactly Navigationally, it would make a lot more sense And you also would save a lot of typing You know because you wouldn't have to always put the dot-com at the end.

750
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,500
Speaker 0: The comm would just always be there and you would just replace like that last part.

751
00:48:51,962 --> 00:49:02,240
Speaker 1: I think part of it is that as soon as the internet grew at all people were no longer Cooperative in this world like it was an ecosystem where I should make a chromium fork that displays the URL properly.

752
00:49:02,843 --> 00:49:03,847
Speaker 0: It's just the HTTP.

753
00:49:03,887 --> 00:49:06,960
Speaker 0: comm dot is always there and you start typing after it by default.

754
00:49:07,301 --> 00:49:18,540
Speaker 1: So, I mean think about the way if in the old system would only work if whoever managed cats calm Was willing to share and work with everybody and be kind of neutral on all issues.

755
00:49:18,821 --> 00:49:21,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know let you know whatever dot cats calm whatever dot whatever.

756
00:49:21,911 --> 00:49:24,440
Speaker 1: you needed this huge chain of trust for that to work.

757
00:49:25,163 --> 00:49:31,225
Speaker 1: And as we've learned as soon as the internet opened up to the masses and even slightly before that You can't trust anyone.

758
00:49:31,326 --> 00:49:34,414
Speaker 1: and the chain of trust basically didn't extend past the TLDs.

759
00:49:34,715 --> 00:49:35,498
Speaker 1: no immediately.

760
00:49:35,558 --> 00:49:37,105
Speaker 1: so we're stuck with that I can't argue.

761
00:49:37,125 --> 00:49:42,647
Speaker 0: Well, the other problem is that they used to be just one registrar right and now there's.

762
00:49:42,868 --> 00:49:43,791
Speaker 0: anyone can be a registrar.

763
00:49:43,811 --> 00:49:51,076
Speaker 0: pretty much even you know, even Google's a registrar and Because of that there's a bunch of people in the dome, you know, even now still in the domain.

764
00:49:51,176 --> 00:49:52,160
Speaker 0: money-making game.

765
00:49:52,562 --> 00:49:54,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's play money-making.

766
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:56,000
Speaker 1: domain name squatting would have been trivial to quash.

767
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:58,680
Speaker 1: It's just that no one involved actually wanted to quash it.

768
00:49:58,908 --> 00:50:01,103
Speaker 0: Yeah And it's it's.

769
00:50:01,223 --> 00:50:01,705
Speaker 0: even now.

770
00:50:01,825 --> 00:50:10,745
Speaker 0: some of the policies that I can is thinking up are like, you know for these new domain These new top-level domains they're coming up with they're gonna have like Proportional pricing.

771
00:50:10,785 --> 00:50:12,772
Speaker 0: like you know a word in the domain.

772
00:50:12,852 --> 00:50:17,228
Speaker 0: if your domain that you want to register has words in it It'll cost more than if it's a bunch of random gibberish.

773
00:50:17,408 --> 00:50:24,360
Speaker 0: or the less characters in the domain you register the more money It'll cost as opposed to having a flat registration fee across the board.

774
00:50:24,501 --> 00:50:27,820
Speaker 1: Well, it seems like this is really aimed at brand names.

775
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:29,844
Speaker 1: Yeah That is just dot brand name.

776
00:50:29,885 --> 00:50:31,489
Speaker 1: so we could get dot geek nights.

777
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:34,940
Speaker 1: we could and then everything we do would be dot geek nights.

778
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,235
Speaker 1: And I just I feel like that.

779
00:50:37,255 --> 00:50:38,040
Speaker 0: that becomes available.

780
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,913
Speaker 0: We have to get it but it might think they might charge a lot of money.

781
00:50:40,953 --> 00:50:45,249
Speaker 1: They probably will charge a lot of money Yeah, and I almost don't want it at that point.

782
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:54,751
Speaker 1: I know right but maybe if they do it this way Maybe they'll have something like you can't get something that someone else's trademark Maybe there's.

783
00:50:54,772 --> 00:51:06,780
Speaker 1: there's been a lot of The fact that trademarks in America don't necessarily line up with trademarks in other countries I know and you can have two trademarks that are identical, but are in different realms.

784
00:51:07,402 --> 00:51:08,686
Speaker 1: you know what.

785
00:51:08,787 --> 00:51:17,727
Speaker 0: this is a huge problem because you have this internationally shared system and The laws about this system are different everywhere right luckily What if I buy?

786
00:51:17,969 --> 00:51:19,418
Speaker 0: what if I get dot McDonald's?

787
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,173
Speaker 0: But I live in a country where I have the trademark for McDonald's.

788
00:51:23,253 --> 00:51:24,960
Speaker 0: can the McDonald's in the United States?

789
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:27,570
Speaker 0: Maybe that McDonald's is a bad example because it's a global guy.

790
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:36,311
Speaker 1: Here's the answer the u.s One will always win because Whether or not people agree with it being the right thing or not Most of the internet infrastructure is in the u.s.

791
00:51:36,371 --> 00:51:38,120
Speaker 1: Most of the control of the internet is in the u.s.

792
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:41,999
Speaker 1: And yeah pretty much I mean dot-com is synonymous with dot u.s.

793
00:51:42,901 --> 00:51:45,250
Speaker 0: But the other problem is right is what you know.

794
00:51:45,391 --> 00:51:50,151
Speaker 0: even if we go to like a distributed DNS system Right then we'll get rid of all these.

795
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:55,918
Speaker 0: you know governmental and and Whatever money issues, but instead we'll have the incredible trust issues.

796
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:56,943
Speaker 1: Let's look at the.

797
00:51:56,963 --> 00:52:05,600
Speaker 1: you know originally the idea of adding like dot biz and all these other TLDs was to allow more people to get domains.

798
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:10,202
Speaker 1: now We were running out of useful domain space because that was before the era of Everyone.

799
00:52:10,222 --> 00:52:14,320
Speaker 1: just types in what they're looking for in the browser bar and Google just figures it out.

800
00:52:14,741 --> 00:52:18,739
Speaker 1: Yep, which means don't do this doesn't matter that much anymore to most people.

801
00:52:18,819 --> 00:52:23,980
Speaker 0: well Yeah, I mean most people only use DNS for the web right at least as far as they know.

802
00:52:24,662 --> 00:52:26,749
Speaker 0: And if they just Google everything we could.

803
00:52:26,789 --> 00:52:28,374
Speaker 0: just you know Google is some.

804
00:52:28,394 --> 00:52:30,120
Speaker 0: there's some browsers that are experimenting.

805
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:34,580
Speaker 0: We get hiding the location bar and just you click on links for everything and Google search everything.

806
00:52:34,841 --> 00:52:38,354
Speaker 0: Yeah, then you know eat the URL could be a fucking ipv6 address.

807
00:52:38,375 --> 00:52:39,619
Speaker 0: You don't even give a shit because you don't see it.

808
00:52:41,383 --> 00:52:42,147
Speaker 0: But then what you know?

809
00:52:42,208 --> 00:52:46,971
Speaker 0: you still need to be able to give someone Tell someone in the world a URL for them to go to.

810
00:52:46,991 --> 00:52:49,160
Speaker 0: you know and it can't give its numbers.

811
00:52:49,261 --> 00:52:49,905
Speaker 0: That's not gonna work.

812
00:52:49,946 --> 00:52:51,839
Speaker 1: We could replace that with QR codes.

813
00:52:53,121 --> 00:52:57,360
Speaker 0: QR codes are helpful, but you know you still need to be able to tell somebody right it can't.

814
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:00,452
Speaker 0: What if someone doesn't have a phone?

815
00:53:00,472 --> 00:53:06,460
Speaker 0: yeah, all right There's it's and you know it's still needs to happen and also there's a lot of time.

816
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:06,925
Speaker 0: You know what?

817
00:53:06,945 --> 00:53:08,400
Speaker 0: if you say want to go configure?

818
00:53:09,541 --> 00:53:13,080
Speaker 0: Your you need to configure your phone to connect to your gmails.

819
00:53:13,442 --> 00:53:16,134
Speaker 0: So what if you can't type in mail that google.com?

820
00:53:16,154 --> 00:53:17,420
Speaker 0: you have to type in a bunch of gibberish.

821
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,656
Speaker 0: That's gonna make it a lot more difficult for a lot of people.

822
00:53:20,018 --> 00:53:22,712
Speaker 1: yep But I think the real you know.

823
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:33,340
Speaker 1: to get back to what I was going for this I think the real reason this happened is just a gigantic cash grab because Every big company already buys every domain is even close to the name of their company.

824
00:53:33,541 --> 00:53:36,260
Speaker 0: I mistyped Amazon today, and I ended up at Amazon.

825
00:53:36,581 --> 00:53:38,346
Speaker 0: Yeah before I was able to correct myself.

826
00:53:38,427 --> 00:53:42,820
Speaker 1: however if you mistype FARC you get to a surprising number of extremely shady websites.

827
00:53:44,381 --> 00:53:51,157
Speaker 1: But I feel like every big company is just going to have to buy Dot everything even close to their company's name.

828
00:53:51,177 --> 00:53:56,400
Speaker 1: yep And no one else is really good that everyone else is gonna be priced out of this pretty much.

829
00:53:56,821 --> 00:53:59,653
Speaker 1: I mean, maybe valve will get dot valve or dot steam.

830
00:54:00,055 --> 00:54:01,059
Speaker 1: that could be a little cool.

831
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:01,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, it could be.

832
00:54:01,991 --> 00:54:03,623
Speaker 0: it could be cool But it's not like.

833
00:54:03,643 --> 00:54:05,249
Speaker 1: you know if I had money.

834
00:54:05,269 --> 00:54:07,476
Speaker 1: I would do whatever I could to get dot sucks.

835
00:54:08,058 --> 00:54:13,891
Speaker 0: No That's gonna be something like a million dollars million dollars you kidding.

836
00:54:14,693 --> 00:54:17,100
Speaker 0: and then someone's gonna have the trademark on sucks.

837
00:54:17,664 --> 00:54:19,194
Speaker 1: Ah, then I could get like someone on slash.

838
00:54:19,294 --> 00:54:20,080
Speaker 1: I had the same idea.

839
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:20,462
Speaker 1: They're like.

840
00:54:20,482 --> 00:54:21,085
Speaker 1: so then I can get.

841
00:54:21,145 --> 00:54:23,236
Speaker 1: I can dot org dot sucks dot sucks dot sucks.

842
00:54:23,617 --> 00:54:31,439
Speaker 0: Oh Maybe we should get Cox and then we can do sucks that Cox and then we could do anything else.

843
00:54:31,479 --> 00:54:32,728
Speaker 0: you could do Whatever sucks Cox.

844
00:54:32,889 --> 00:54:37,193
Speaker 1: I'm gonna turn into a techno kind of pedant for a moment.

845
00:54:37,856 --> 00:54:45,940
Speaker 1: my only Technological argument against this is that the whole point of top-level domains is do not have a flat namespace.

846
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:50,380
Speaker 1: No We already fucked it up by having the second level effectively be a flat namespace.

847
00:54:51,084 --> 00:55:02,144
Speaker 1: Because every way if you know geek nice that if we were a big company We don't geek nice calm dot org dot gov dot biz on everything well They're not gonna have it be completely flat right they're just gonna have you know More.

848
00:55:02,284 --> 00:55:02,566
Speaker 0: oh no.

849
00:55:02,606 --> 00:55:03,431
Speaker 1: This is the first step.

850
00:55:03,471 --> 00:55:04,840
Speaker 1: you realize I'm pretty sure.

851
00:55:05,061 --> 00:55:08,474
Speaker 1: Eventually if you have money you can get dot whatever the fuck you want.

852
00:55:08,856 --> 00:55:14,454
Speaker 0: well if they do it that way Why don't they just get rid of DNS and just have it be one flat namespace?

853
00:55:14,514 --> 00:55:16,299
Speaker 0: forget any hierarchy entirely.

854
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:17,484
Speaker 1: yeah Because it's very.

855
00:55:17,645 --> 00:55:23,619
Speaker 1: the thing is some people are gonna have the business model of getting dot sucks And then selling something dot sucks.

856
00:55:24,601 --> 00:55:25,887
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a good business model.

857
00:55:26,007 --> 00:55:28,779
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's gonna be a great business model for a long time to come from.

858
00:55:28,819 --> 00:55:36,820
Speaker 0: no I should write a piece of software that basically Where if you have a top-level domain you plug it in and it does the job of selling this up the you know regular domains.

859
00:55:36,945 --> 00:55:41,819
Speaker 1: Yeah This is gonna be like another gold rush of domain squatting.

860
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:47,860
Speaker 1: well They're thinking about doing some sort of auction system - I know and imagine how many lawsuits they're gonna be about trademarks immediately.

861
00:55:49,822 --> 00:55:53,204
Speaker 1: Everything about this pisses me off What this is.

862
00:55:53,304 --> 00:56:02,840
Speaker 0: why right we need the only people who should ever make decisions about technology our Tim Berners-Lee our technology People Tim Berners-Lee and Steve Jobs, maybe he's a technology person Wozniak.

863
00:56:03,161 --> 00:56:06,955
Speaker 0: Yeah, only technology people should be allowed to make technology decisions.

864
00:56:07,015 --> 00:56:07,156
Speaker 0: right.

865
00:56:07,176 --> 00:56:11,313
Speaker 0: you wouldn't let me You know decide some medical decision for you.

866
00:56:11,373 --> 00:56:12,840
Speaker 0: Why cuz I'm not a fucking doctor?

867
00:56:13,323 --> 00:56:16,000
Speaker 0: So why are we letting these governments who are politicians?

868
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:21,895
Speaker 1: We can let them make political but many governments do have a position like technological secretary or something.

869
00:56:21,915 --> 00:56:23,660
Speaker 0: meanwhile the government the United States.

870
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:26,588
Speaker 0: Was he the chief information officer where Vivek Kundra?

871
00:56:26,608 --> 00:56:27,631
Speaker 0: he quit.

872
00:56:28,032 --> 00:56:28,654
Speaker 0: he just quit.

873
00:56:28,815 --> 00:56:29,998
Speaker 0: yeah, he's he's gone.

874
00:56:30,058 --> 00:56:30,680
Speaker 0: He's going to Harvard.

875
00:56:31,081 --> 00:56:32,606
Speaker 1: I have a feeling if I had that job.

876
00:56:32,706 --> 00:56:37,420
Speaker 1: I would quit no or I would go crazy and just punch somebody in Congress.

877
00:56:37,641 --> 00:56:39,592
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think what we actually need.

878
00:56:39,632 --> 00:56:42,225
Speaker 1: picture myself like running into Congress Just like punching people.

879
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:49,578
Speaker 0: if I wanted to you know if I wanted to experiment with new forms of government I would have some form of government where it was pretty much technocracy.

880
00:56:49,819 --> 00:56:58,400
Speaker 0: well No, I don't know if you would call it technocracy But basically right there would be the president of doctors and the doctors would vote for the president of doctors.

881
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,259
Speaker 1: How do you decide who's the doctor in the first place?

882
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:11,550
Speaker 1: They have medical degrees so anyone with a credit universities anyone with a medical degree from an accredited university and They elect their doctor, so how do who counts as a tech guy?

883
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:12,955
Speaker 1: then who counts for IT?

884
00:57:13,316 --> 00:57:14,360
Speaker 1: only people with IT degrees.

885
00:57:15,322 --> 00:57:17,637
Speaker 0: There you know we basically we I mean do you not get a vote?

886
00:57:17,657 --> 00:57:20,731
Speaker 1: obviously You don't get a vote in the IT president.

887
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:21,173
Speaker 1: listen.

888
00:57:21,253 --> 00:57:25,668
Speaker 1: I'm the I listen obviously Pragmatically right terrible idea.

889
00:57:25,749 --> 00:57:37,374
Speaker 0: our current world doesn't have this you know system in place And you'd have to you know if you wanted to realistically do this you sort of have to start based on our you know current Organizational constructs and evolve them into a you know.

890
00:57:37,595 --> 00:57:38,680
Speaker 0: so over time to something.

891
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:50,460
Speaker 1: It's impossible because even if you ignore the vast majority of the concerns around it There's a primary concern that everyone involved in the process has a vested interest in corrupting it to their own ends.

892
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:52,263
Speaker 0: Yeah, but what you do.

893
00:57:52,283 --> 00:57:57,040
Speaker 1: There's no way to have a system of checks and balances because every group regulates itself.

894
00:57:57,421 --> 00:57:59,909
Speaker 0: No, there's easy way to make a system of checks and balance.

895
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:17,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, there is a. you will have the the justice squad All right, and the justice squad basically are people who love to go catch corrupt people and if you're corrupt Flaying Alright, so the justice squad is already ten corrupt guys and one guy who doesn't know the rest of corrupt.

896
00:58:17,609 --> 00:58:23,516
Speaker 0: Nope Because there's the justice the watching watchmen and they watch the each other and they just really want to play each other.

897
00:58:23,878 --> 00:58:24,740
Speaker 1: look ye mighty.

898
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:25,459
Speaker 1: exactly.

899
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:29,020
Speaker 0: So you know the penalty is so severe.

900
00:58:29,201 --> 00:58:34,745
Speaker 0: You know it's not like oh you get a slap on the wrist and you get to go work at a company instead of the being In the government anymore.

901
00:58:34,765 --> 00:58:35,248
Speaker 0: right it's?

902
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:37,640
Speaker 0: oh you're corrupt even if you're a little corrupt.

903
00:58:37,821 --> 00:58:38,322
Speaker 0: Oh, what's that?

904
00:58:38,403 --> 00:58:40,932
Speaker 0: You you know you gave some government money to some company.

905
00:58:40,952 --> 00:58:42,237
Speaker 0: you favored them on a government contract.

906
00:58:42,277 --> 00:58:43,060
Speaker 0: Guess what flaying?

907
00:58:43,701 --> 00:58:45,231
Speaker 0: Yeah, no one will fucking do that anymore.

908
00:58:45,251 --> 00:58:50,134
Speaker 1: I I feel like if I had my druthers and I had the role of DNA.

909
00:58:50,295 --> 00:58:51,540
Speaker 0: obviously deflaying is a joke.

910
00:58:51,741 --> 00:58:55,911
Speaker 0: Yeah, not that I wouldn't like to see a few flings Depends on the context.

911
00:58:56,093 --> 00:58:58,323
Speaker 0: It depends Flensing perhaps.

912
00:58:58,685 --> 00:59:00,191
Speaker 1: Oh shit much worse than flaying.

913
00:59:00,231 --> 00:59:01,858
Speaker 0: You're you're getting too rough on me.

914
00:59:01,878 --> 00:59:02,300
Speaker 0: There's a reason.

915
00:59:04,643 --> 00:59:08,220
Speaker 1: If I had my way with DNS I would not let any of this happen No kidding.

916
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:16,080
Speaker 1: And I would set it up such that you couldn't effectively domain squat and there are ways to prevent that mainly by not letting you know.

917
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:23,340
Speaker 1: There was that the borrowing system where you know Like get a domain name but not have to pay for it if you gave it back before a certain amount of time.

918
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:26,653
Speaker 1: There were like all these loopholes so trivial to get rid of.

919
00:59:26,734 --> 00:59:28,260
Speaker 0: here's the solution for domain squatting.

920
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:35,199
Speaker 0: You're ready some sort of system that counts like DNS queries And if your domain isn't queried then you lose it.

921
00:59:35,801 --> 00:59:37,032
Speaker 0: Also, there's a lot of this.

922
00:59:37,072 --> 00:59:37,940
Speaker 0: who is shielding?

923
00:59:38,781 --> 00:59:45,717
Speaker 0: I would basically if you I would just have a thing that goes and checks the who is is and It would actually be like a group of people and all they do is slowly check the who is is.

924
00:59:45,737 --> 00:59:46,882
Speaker 0: they don't have to do It very efficient.

925
00:59:46,963 --> 00:59:51,780
Speaker 1: Alright Scott, so I hire some guy to get the domain in his name, but really it's mine done.

926
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:55,756
Speaker 0: I'm safe as long as he's got his full address and everything on there and it's for real.

927
00:59:55,977 --> 00:59:56,600
Speaker 1: Also, do you worry?

928
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:58,415
Speaker 1: I mean I'm ambivalent on that cuz.

929
00:59:58,435 --> 01:00:12,731
Speaker 1: on one hand I like the idea that you could get a domain name and yet you're anonymous But on the other hand, I feel like the privilege of a domain name is worth forcing people to legitimately identify themselves Thus making domain names very powerful mechanisms of trust,

930
01:00:13,092 --> 01:00:15,580
Speaker 0: you know, we could do is we could set up a separate DNS system

931
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,345
Speaker 1: Anonymous domains and Verified domains.

932
01:00:20,726 --> 01:00:23,718
Speaker 0: Yeah, and basically you would choose like it would be the.

933
01:00:23,778 --> 01:00:25,104
Speaker 0: you know Real people would.

934
01:00:25,144 --> 01:00:26,712
Speaker 0: normal people would never be able to use this.

935
01:00:26,792 --> 01:00:28,520
Speaker 0: but I could imagine a user interface.

936
01:00:28,861 --> 01:00:30,065
Speaker 0: We're in your web browser.

937
01:00:30,406 --> 01:00:34,880
Speaker 0: You basically have a little pull down or some sort of switch that switches between namespaces, right?

938
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:35,230
Speaker 0: Yeah.

939
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:41,103
Speaker 0: So you'd like click and it would be like old world DNS would be the default and you would like uncheck the checkbox or go to the poll.

940
01:00:41,143 --> 01:00:42,634
Speaker 1: example, maybe I'll go to.

941
01:00:42,996 --> 01:00:51,280
Speaker 1: you know Anonymous lead hacker dot something that is totally anonymous and you know I'm taking my life in my own hands when I go there at least my browser, right?

942
01:00:51,360 --> 01:01:00,040
Speaker 0: So like in the normal DNS system google.com points here But in the nerd special DNS system google.com goes to some other server, you know nerds could just do that.

943
01:01:00,442 --> 01:01:01,228
Speaker 0: We could just set that up.

944
01:01:01,248 --> 01:01:02,436
Speaker 0: We don't even need a new software.

945
01:01:02,457 --> 01:01:02,920
Speaker 0: You just bind.

946
01:01:03,482 --> 01:01:04,585
Speaker 0: Yeah, I set up.

947
01:01:04,665 --> 01:01:09,460
Speaker 0: I just all bind and everyone just changes their DNS settings to point at it done.

948
01:01:09,861 --> 01:01:15,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only problem is that the way most had the only problem most DNS clients, right?

949
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:20,160
Speaker 0: The way they're set up is to just go down the list of DNS servers trying each one in order.

950
01:01:20,341 --> 01:01:25,920
Speaker 0: They're not set up to like you got to basically have some sort of resolve.com switcher that switched it back and forth.

951
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:38,787
Speaker 1: the way that DNS actually works is one of those weird things where I Feel like I know it because I went to university and most techies don't actually know how DNS were all that most Weird problems.

952
01:01:38,828 --> 01:01:41,560
Speaker 1: They can't understand why when they try to like multi home themselves.

953
01:01:41,701 --> 01:01:46,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, even tech people most of them all they know is that names translate into numbers and that's all they know.

954
01:01:47,343 --> 01:01:50,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, tell me what a quadruple a record is and we'll talk.

955
01:01:50,783 --> 01:01:52,470
Speaker 0: I know what a 1a record is.

956
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:55,925
Speaker 0: I don't know what a quadruple a record really, you know, yeah So what's a 1a record?

957
01:01:56,306 --> 01:01:59,680
Speaker 0: That's just you've mapped, you know in a domain directly to an IP address.

958
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:02,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what a quadruple a is same thing ipv6.

959
01:02:03,433 --> 01:02:05,420
Speaker 0: Oh, I didn't know that ipv6 had to have a different name.

960
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:06,688
Speaker 1: Yeah, how about MX record?

961
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:08,398
Speaker 0: That's for mail the mail exchange.

962
01:02:08,419 --> 01:02:12,744
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, that's because when an email client is looking for the IP address It doesn't.

963
01:02:12,945 --> 01:02:15,880
Speaker 0: it doesn't just look for say, you know, the the a record it looks for the MX.

964
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,047
Speaker 1: here's a sad question.

965
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:26,220
Speaker 1: don't feel bad if you can't answer this one because I've never interviewed anyone ever who can answer it and these are all people who had DNS written on their resume.

966
01:02:26,461 --> 01:02:28,327
Speaker 1: All right, what's a PTR record?

967
01:02:28,989 --> 01:02:30,734
Speaker 0: It's uh, I used it once.

968
01:02:30,754 --> 01:02:32,520
Speaker 0: it's like it's a it's fuck.

969
01:02:32,721 --> 01:02:34,388
Speaker 0: Yeah, I used it for like jabber or some shit.

970
01:02:34,508 --> 01:02:35,151
Speaker 0: Yeah, you did.

971
01:02:35,412 --> 01:02:37,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I forget it's the reverse lookup.

972
01:02:37,641 --> 01:02:38,806
Speaker 0: No reverse solid.

973
01:02:38,886 --> 01:02:40,111
Speaker 0: is that's the reason that I don't know?

974
01:02:40,151 --> 01:02:47,413
Speaker 0: that is because every time I set up the reverse automatic for most people No, it's that when you set it up It's in like a separate UI as opposed to actually being a PTR record.

975
01:02:47,654 --> 01:02:49,763
Speaker 1: Oh because you set it up through our Provider.

976
01:02:49,944 --> 01:02:53,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, you know every other I write every configuration file.

977
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:57,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, every other kind of record I set up even like TXT records and MX records.

978
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:02,159
Speaker 0: They're all in the same like blob of text, but the PTR record isn't a separate bit.

979
01:03:02,502 --> 01:03:06,554
Speaker 0: Yeah, I get you know You don't just put it in with the other records and don't even get into.

980
01:03:06,594 --> 01:03:07,720
Speaker 1: people can't ever explain to me.

981
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:09,998
Speaker 1: you know in dot adder dot our power any of the head.

982
01:03:10,038 --> 01:03:16,879
Speaker 1: but But now people who wrote DNS on the resume never could tell me what a pointer record was exciting.

983
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:18,925
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, it's kind of.

984
01:03:19,146 --> 01:03:19,687
Speaker 0: it's kind of sad.

985
01:03:19,707 --> 01:03:31,352
Speaker 0: we have the system and it's basically the whole internet relies on the system very much Not just that system and it's mismanaged Bigger problem that a lot of the core architecture of the internet.

986
01:03:32,134 --> 01:03:40,240
Speaker 1: This is the separate show I think is Based on technology where there are fewer people who know it today than I think there were 20 years ago.

987
01:03:40,581 --> 01:03:45,859
Speaker 1: Maybe I think fewer people understand how things like NTP or SNMP work now than did 20 years ago.

988
01:03:47,462 --> 01:03:48,459
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz they're probably more.

989
01:03:49,541 --> 01:03:54,640
Speaker 0: More of the people who worked on it are dead or forgot or fought fell out of practice.

990
01:03:55,041 --> 01:03:55,724
Speaker 0: Things have changed.

991
01:03:55,764 --> 01:04:00,800
Speaker 0: They haven't kept up with it and fewer people have picked up on it and learned it from scratch.

992
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:08,205
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean the number of people I've met in my life who can configure an Apache server like like guru legit style Configure for performance.

993
01:04:08,947 --> 01:04:12,760
Speaker 1: I've met maybe four people who I think could do that on a nine out of ten.

994
01:04:12,881 --> 01:04:16,060
Speaker 0: I mean I can do it nine out of ten, but I can't do it ten out of ten.

995
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:17,206
Speaker 1: No one can do a ten out of ten.

996
01:04:17,226 --> 01:04:18,392
Speaker 1: There was one guy and he's dead.

997
01:04:18,412 --> 01:04:20,985
Speaker 0: There's all sorts of magic weird shit I just ignore in there.

998
01:04:21,206 --> 01:04:24,424
Speaker 1: Yeah, I I often look up what other people have done who I trust It's like.

999
01:04:24,465 --> 01:04:33,380
Speaker 0: I know a whole bunch of it But I only know the parts that you know You have to use 90% of the time Parts that like you don't really use that often that are configured by default to be the right way.

1000
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,169
Speaker 1: A lot of it's the performance tuning stuff.

1001
01:04:35,209 --> 01:04:36,415
Speaker 1: I'm often unclear on.

1002
01:04:36,596 --> 01:04:47,712
Speaker 0: I've even I've Studied it and can done it a whole bunch of times and it's still confusing because the documentation is just so awful Especially Depending on what modules you use underneath.

1003
01:04:48,014 --> 01:04:49,240
Speaker 0: it can get really fucked up, right?

1004
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:54,619
Speaker 0: It's like well, you know the worker NPM works like this and the event NPM which is new works like this.

1005
01:04:55,061 --> 01:04:59,700
Speaker 0: But what if you have the mod WSGI working underneath the worker NPM?

1006
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:02,576
Speaker 0: Well, and that has its own specific specified configuration.

1007
01:05:02,616 --> 01:05:02,938
Speaker 0: what then?

1008
01:05:06,732 --> 01:05:10,930
Speaker 0: And you even ask people they can't give you straight answers people who pretend to be experts.

1009
01:05:11,151 --> 01:05:13,178
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had I had one of those O'Reilly books.

1010
01:05:13,279 --> 01:05:15,909

1011
01:05:15,929 --> 01:05:19,524
