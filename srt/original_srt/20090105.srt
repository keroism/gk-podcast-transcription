1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,505
Speaker 0: It's Monday January 5th.

2
00:00:11,706 --> 00:00:12,288
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,428 --> 00:00:16,338
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight the humble netbook.

4
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,962
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:33,938
Speaker 0: I can't believe there's only one more year of the knots.

6
00:00:34,379 --> 00:00:34,640
Speaker 0: I guess.

7
00:00:36,682 --> 00:00:38,609
Speaker 1: What do they call like you know?

8
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:41,400
Speaker 1: thing is you don't have anything for them to call the nod.

9
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, they called it on eight back in the day.

10
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, what do you call the tens?

11
00:00:46,582 --> 00:00:49,560
Speaker 0: We were not gonna worry about that teens that they're not all teens.

12
00:00:49,781 --> 00:00:50,991
Speaker 0: We're not gonna worry about that.

13
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,120
Speaker 1: that's even harder to name.

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,721
Speaker 1: But then we get to the 20s will be all good for the rest of our lives like ah you know what I think it'll Happen.

15
00:00:56,741 --> 00:01:13,662
Speaker 0: because when I listen to old people talk they say aught up to 19 aught 9 or aught 9 And then they say for all the tens they just say like 1911 1919 and then we hit 20. they say the 20s Mmm.

16
00:01:14,004 --> 00:01:15,431
Speaker 0: I think that's what we have to do.

17
00:01:15,491 --> 00:01:17,059
Speaker 0: There is no other reasonable option.

18
00:01:17,842 --> 00:01:21,512
Speaker 1: Let's just change English so that they're all teens.

19
00:01:21,592 --> 00:01:22,996
Speaker 1: It's 10 teen 11 teen 12 teen 13 teen.

20
00:01:27,062 --> 00:01:27,484
Speaker 1: We'll be good.

21
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,248
Speaker 1: we'll come the teens.

22
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:30,580
Speaker 0: I was an advocate of that curse when I was a little kid.

23
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:40,320
Speaker 0: I remember I used to argue very much that English originally used base 12 because 11 and 12 were such weird numbers, and it made so much sense.

24
00:01:40,942 --> 00:01:49,862
Speaker 0: Good job, and then when I was an omology when I was like seventh grade my teacher was like that's clever, but wrong Of course.

25
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:53,434
Speaker 0: then he went on to agree with me that base 12 is much more useful, and we should have used that.

26
00:01:53,454 --> 00:02:00,999
Speaker 1: I Guess if you like four three two and six you got so many factors in there.

27
00:02:02,301 --> 00:02:02,662
Speaker 1: What do you need?

28
00:02:02,682 --> 00:02:07,376
Speaker 1: the factors for most people can't factor for anything so I don't know.

29
00:02:07,577 --> 00:02:10,146
Speaker 0: you know it's more useful For people like me.

30
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:12,760
Speaker 0: maybe less useful for people who can't read or write.

31
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:14,335
Speaker 1: I don't know who know.

32
00:02:14,355 --> 00:02:25,839
Speaker 0: I don't care But we'll probably do a show about the the New Year's extravaganza because we basically had the front row crew Up in beacon or down in beacon depending on you know which people for about a week.

33
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:27,970
Speaker 1: It was a good time.

34
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,166
Speaker 0: It was kind of awesome though we actually had by all.

35
00:02:31,286 --> 00:02:45,282
Speaker 0: we almost missed the new year because Scott and a bunch of people were upstairs playing Agricola and The game was running long, and I walked upstairs, and I'm looking at them And I'm counting up like who's gonna win, and I walk downstairs, and I look and it's like 1158

36
00:02:45,282 --> 00:02:45,422
Speaker 1: yeah,

37
00:02:46,405 --> 00:02:53,411
Speaker 0: and I'm like popping the champagne and trying to pour and all the I'm trying to make like 25 glasses of champagne And get everything ready.

38
00:02:53,713 --> 00:02:54,740
Speaker 0: we all run downstairs.

39
00:02:55,302 --> 00:02:58,072
Speaker 0: I couldn't even get the NIST clock up in time.

40
00:02:58,092 --> 00:02:59,517
Speaker 1: you suck you going for the NIST clock.

41
00:02:59,537 --> 00:03:01,489
Speaker 1: you got to go for time Gov it's much faster.

42
00:03:01,992 --> 00:03:04,483
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I went for the NIST clock I use at work because you're stupid.

43
00:03:04,804 --> 00:03:05,005
Speaker 1: time.

44
00:03:05,225 --> 00:03:10,979
Speaker 0: gov has been trusty every year, but luckily we made it because of that extra leap.

45
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:13,847
Speaker 0: second Not really we made it.

46
00:03:13,967 --> 00:03:16,959
Speaker 1: we said no people like looking at the cell phones like oh, we missed it.

47
00:03:19,103 --> 00:03:21,056
Speaker 1: It's not really that important.

48
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:28,649
Speaker 1: - oh yes It is at some exact an arbitrary moment in time Which is no different than this exact moment in time.

49
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,040
Speaker 0: I point out that I'm a person who celebrated the millennium on the proper year.

50
00:03:33,642 --> 00:03:35,070
Speaker 0: All right, I did.

51
00:03:35,693 --> 00:03:40,396
Speaker 1: Oh no an arbitrary You know calendar thing whoo you know what.

52
00:03:40,476 --> 00:03:44,734
Speaker 1: if it wasn't for Gregor it would be a totally different date that you would do this.

53
00:03:45,116 --> 00:03:50,616
Speaker 0: okay, but anyway We sang all Lang sign, and then it odd yesterday the last of the stragglers left our house.

54
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,787
Speaker 1: Oh Wow, it was yesterday.

55
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:53,331
Speaker 0: Yes.

56
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,640
Speaker 0: It was yesterday.

57
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,060
Speaker 1: Ah Well the house is like we cleaned it up surprisingly well.

58
00:04:01,281 --> 00:04:04,280
Speaker 0: We clean the house up faster than we used to after some D&D games.

59
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:07,979
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's still got some cleaning to do, but it's not too bad.

60
00:04:08,553 --> 00:04:20,899
Speaker 0: Yeah I think part of it was that in the New Year's party because so much like people went out of their way to pick up after themselves as opposed to D&D where I would find like a Half full glass of something under the couch undisturbed.

61
00:04:21,482 --> 00:04:24,555
Speaker 1: Yeah, also a lot of people were at other people's houses for sleeping.

62
00:04:24,595 --> 00:04:25,017
Speaker 1: that helped.

63
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,406
Speaker 0: Oh my god Did that help including me?

64
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:31,058
Speaker 0: I actually just kind of slept somewhere else and let people use my bed the whole week.

65
00:04:31,078 --> 00:04:33,725
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, I wasn't about to do that.

66
00:04:33,745 --> 00:04:34,950
Speaker 1: I need my bed.

67
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, the nice thing was I could wake up to quietude.

68
00:04:37,943 --> 00:04:42,648
Speaker 0: I could take a shower immediately Without having to worry about anyone else taking showers.

69
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,460
Speaker 1: I just showered it weird at different times that way to be hot water.

70
00:04:47,522 --> 00:04:48,990
Speaker 0: I kind of like a shower right away.

71
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd like to but it's not necessary.

72
00:04:51,261 --> 00:04:53,711
Speaker 0: But anyway, we'll talk about all that some Thursday.

73
00:04:53,751 --> 00:05:06,496
Speaker 0: I'm sure you're interested because if nothing else Saturday night Really felt like college suddenly like we'd all been around long enough to where we all Slipped back into the college lifestyle and that was one hell of a night as a result.

74
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,035
Speaker 0: All right So so not enthusiastic.

75
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:11,660
Speaker 0: what's up with you?

76
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:13,503
Speaker 1: I'm tired.

77
00:05:13,644 --> 00:05:13,845
Speaker 0: Mr.

78
00:05:13,885 --> 00:05:14,728
Speaker 0: How could you be tired?

79
00:05:14,768 --> 00:05:16,816
Speaker 0: We went to bed at like 8 yesterday.

80
00:05:16,836 --> 00:05:18,102
Speaker 1: I want to bed at 10.

81
00:05:18,102 --> 00:05:18,565
Speaker 1: Why?

82
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:20,360
Speaker 0: because what were you doing?

83
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:24,247
Speaker 0: Were you just surfing the internet?

84
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:25,713
Speaker 0: no, it's no better than playing.

85
00:05:25,753 --> 00:05:27,580
Speaker 1: Wow, I wasn't doing that either.

86
00:05:27,721 --> 00:05:29,409
Speaker 0: You're playing Fallout a single-player.

87
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:33,484
Speaker 1: I stopped playing that at like 7 or 8.

88
00:05:33,484 --> 00:05:34,720
Speaker 0: Good game anyway.

89
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:36,767
Speaker 0: Tech news Monday, whatever.

90
00:05:36,807 --> 00:05:37,631
Speaker 0: We're back new year.

91
00:05:37,711 --> 00:05:38,414
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

92
00:05:38,455 --> 00:05:39,600
Speaker 0: What do you got in the news?

93
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:44,241
Speaker 1: All right, so, you know Amazon s3, right I May.

94
00:05:44,522 --> 00:05:46,028
Speaker 1: basically it's Amazon's.

95
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:47,776
Speaker 1: is it simple storage solution?

96
00:05:47,796 --> 00:05:48,418
Speaker 1: I think they call it.

97
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:48,780
Speaker 0: I don't know.

98
00:05:48,961 --> 00:05:50,579
Speaker 0: We're thinking about switching to it already.

99
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,420
Speaker 1: I'm already using it for a bunch of stuff.

100
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:58,240
Speaker 0: I'm gonna use it even more after we learn that Libsyn is just using that and then charging us more than they charge them.

101
00:05:58,802 --> 00:06:01,592
Speaker 1: Well, it may or may not be charging us more than they charge them.

102
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,840
Speaker 1: right but check this is how this works, right?

103
00:06:04,502 --> 00:06:10,440
Speaker 1: Let's say, you know you get some hosting right from some company for I don't know a website, right?

104
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,651
Speaker 1: Okay, so then they usually give you a bandwidth limit.

105
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:14,832
Speaker 1: Like.

106
00:06:14,852 --> 00:06:16,797
Speaker 1: for example, our hosting is 200 gigabits a month.

107
00:06:18,362 --> 00:06:41,679
Speaker 1: So if I put a 1 gigabyte video file 1 gigabit video file so it's 2 billion 1 billion bits of video and 200 people download that video then they cut me off and the website will be down until The next month right when it will come back up or I can pay them extra money on a per gigabit basis Which is expensive.

108
00:06:43,381 --> 00:06:58,380
Speaker 1: so if you have things that are high in bandwidth that people are downloading or Maybe you just want to like have a safe place on the internet to put stuff You know, like you want to back up your computer But you don't want to back it up to just a hard drive in your house.

109
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,199
Speaker 1: You want to back it up somewhere serious where you know, it's safe.

110
00:07:01,982 --> 00:07:19,336
Speaker 1: You can just store stuff on Amazon's very very trusty servers and your stuff there is very safe and you can make it encrypted and secure if you want to and If you want you can give other people access to it so that you know I could put a video up there and then everyone in the world could download it.

111
00:07:19,456 --> 00:07:19,738
Speaker 1: and it's.

112
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:27,499
Speaker 1: you know it's not the fastest thing in the universe, but it'll work because it's Amazon servers and It's not free though, you know.

113
00:07:27,821 --> 00:07:34,014
Speaker 1: They charge you based on how much you upload and how much is downloaded even if someone else is doing the downloading That's not you.

114
00:07:35,063 --> 00:07:43,920
Speaker 1: So the result of that, you know Is that I get like a bill from Amazon every month for like a dollar and change because that's really how cheap it is.

115
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:58,900
Speaker 1: now What they did is they just added a feature Which is a very interesting feature in that Let's say I put some files up there and I make them publicly accessible or at least accessible to the other people besides myself.

116
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,899
Speaker 1: Now I can charge those people the cost of them getting the file.

117
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,780
Speaker 1: So So if it cost two cents if it would have cost me two cents for them to download the video I can now charge them two cents.

118
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:27,296
Speaker 1: In fact, I can also charge them more than two cents if I want to and you can actually now very easily set up Some stuff where you put data online and then charge people for downloading it.

119
00:08:27,556 --> 00:08:28,880
Speaker 0: I wonder very very easily.

120
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:34,260
Speaker 0: I wonder if all those shady for-profit podcasts and things are gonna move to this.

121
00:08:34,885 --> 00:08:35,349
Speaker 1: I don't know.

122
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:36,398
Speaker 1: you might see some of that.

123
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:41,578
Speaker 1: You might see like some people putting like wares and then you have to pay them like a dollar to get it.

124
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:45,620
Speaker 0: I don't know about that because you're pretty easily tracked to yourself.

125
00:08:46,283 --> 00:08:47,549
Speaker 1: Yeah, but who's looking at these?

126
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:52,254
Speaker 1: and you know, it could be just some encrypted file Mmm, you know that has a key along with it.

127
00:08:52,455 --> 00:08:55,478
Speaker 1: No one knows Could put all kinds of crazy shit up there.

128
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:57,002
Speaker 1: It's gonna be.

129
00:08:57,022 --> 00:08:59,991
Speaker 1: it's gonna be very interesting the result of this.

130
00:09:00,032 --> 00:09:04,279
Speaker 1: but the question that it mostly raises is you know Who is supposed to pay?

131
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,852
Speaker 1: Right because it's like right now the way the internet works.

132
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:09,560
Speaker 1: as long as things are net neutral.

133
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:15,780
Speaker 1: It's like everyone just pays for a connection that has some speed and then they use as much as they want.

134
00:09:16,243 --> 00:09:16,546
Speaker 0: You know what?

135
00:09:16,566 --> 00:09:22,559
Speaker 0: It's kind of like look at anime conventions versus comic conventions.

136
00:09:23,384 --> 00:09:24,760
Speaker 0: Like it's exactly the same thing.

137
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,450
Speaker 0: I mean if you go to an anime con you pay, you know You're 50 bucks or whatever to get in But then everything in the con is covered by that.

138
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:47,440
Speaker 0: like you want to go to a concert go to the cosplay Go to the panels watch show whatever you want to do you pay for a badge and then that badge gets you into everything Everything in the world, but you go to comic cons and it's like alright I paid my 50 bucks to get in and I can walk around this little room in this little room.

139
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,588
Speaker 0: But hey, I want to go see Kevin Smith up.

140
00:09:49,628 --> 00:09:50,813
Speaker 0: That's another five bucks.

141
00:09:51,114 --> 00:09:52,760
Speaker 0: Want to go get something signed by Stan Lee?

142
00:09:52,862 --> 00:09:54,943
Speaker 0: That's another 50.

143
00:09:54,943 --> 00:10:04,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, kind of like that I guess I. just the question is like if you're hosting some files on the internet, right and you want people to you know Look at those things.

144
00:10:05,302 --> 00:10:12,500
Speaker 1: It's like who is supposed to pair you supposed to pay or it's like it caused Google money every time I go to google.com.

145
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,533
Speaker 1: That's why they make that site as low bandwidth as possible.

146
00:10:15,593 --> 00:10:17,220
Speaker 1: It's like this tiny piece of HTML.

147
00:10:17,461 --> 00:10:23,223
Speaker 1: That's why it says privacy instead of privacy policy because it would cost them that much more Right.

148
00:10:23,805 --> 00:10:27,280
Speaker 1: So right now Google pays when I visit google.com.

149
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:32,300
Speaker 1: But should I pay because I'm the one who's benefiting by visiting google.com?

150
00:10:32,741 --> 00:10:44,154
Speaker 0: I think no because if if we get into that world where it's pay for content and not just paying for bandwidth But also paying for the contents bandwidth not just your own bandwidth.

151
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:57,064
Speaker 0: I One I feel like bandwidth is so cheap that anything that actually What makes you pay for the bandwidth you spend to get it will immediately be subverted by something free Mm-hmm.

152
00:10:57,707 --> 00:10:58,090
Speaker 0: I mean one.

153
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,041
Speaker 0: I would never pay for bandwidth for crap I would.

154
00:11:00,543 --> 00:11:05,340
Speaker 0: I can't conceive of a situation where I would pay for the privilege of looking at something.

155
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,925
Speaker 0: I would just pirate it at that point.

156
00:11:07,687 --> 00:11:23,239
Speaker 1: I think what we should really happen right is when you look at it Everyone is sort of it's even all around, you know, sure I caused Google a lot of money But I have a website and people visit that and it sort of evens out in the end on all sides.

157
00:11:24,181 --> 00:11:32,800
Speaker 1: See, so the only people who really should have to spend a lot of money I think are the people who have a a huge disparity of you know one side or the other.

158
00:11:33,322 --> 00:11:41,391
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is if you look at most people, I mean what 90% of people just consume they don't have a website Mmm, maybe they have a myspace but they're not paying for that.

159
00:11:41,832 --> 00:11:42,976
Speaker 1: No, they're not paying for that.

160
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,027
Speaker 1: Oh Whatever.

161
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:45,430
Speaker 1: It's.

162
00:11:45,511 --> 00:12:00,061
Speaker 1: it's interesting though It is maybe people at least like because one thing is people don't realize it's very difficult even today to set up like quality e-commerce, especially if you have any sort of special needs or If you want it to be shiny and cool, you know It's.

163
00:12:00,081 --> 00:12:05,484
Speaker 1: you're either going to pay a lot of money or you're going to do a lot of hard work Or you're going to have something crappy.

164
00:12:05,505 --> 00:12:08,975
Speaker 1: You really can't get a high-quality thing for free.

165
00:12:09,015 --> 00:12:10,118
Speaker 1: That's exactly what you want.

166
00:12:10,138 --> 00:12:10,860
Speaker 1: That's also good.

167
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,200
Speaker 1: It's just it does doesn't exist.

168
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:28,360
Speaker 1: but you know things like this and Amazon checkout or Amazon payments Google checkout and stuff and It's gonna make it real easy for people to make like, you know, say a site where you know They you download videos and pay for them or something because YouTube doesn't offer that shit.

169
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,135
Speaker 0: It definitely pays the way for micro payments.

170
00:12:31,296 --> 00:12:35,394
Speaker 0: Like it's the first Viable does everyone will it be able to use Amazon?

171
00:12:35,414 --> 00:12:36,600
Speaker 0: It'll just work automatically.

172
00:12:37,082 --> 00:12:42,380
Speaker 1: Yep, basically sign it to Amazon download a bunch of stuff and then at the end of the month they charge you like three bucks.

173
00:12:42,861 --> 00:12:44,343
Speaker 0: Yep, so, I don't know.

174
00:12:44,384 --> 00:12:49,152
Speaker 0: Will this be the beginning of like webcomics and videos and things be having micro payments.

175
00:12:50,835 --> 00:12:58,397
Speaker 1: I Was gonna be real interesting just to see like who uses this and for what.

176
00:12:58,879 --> 00:12:59,763
Speaker 1: yes I'm very.

177
00:12:59,803 --> 00:13:01,472
Speaker 1: I'm very curious to see what happens.

178
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:02,798
Speaker 0: I've got a guess.

179
00:13:04,443 --> 00:13:05,412
Speaker 0: I've got a hard.

180
00:13:05,715 --> 00:13:12,380
Speaker 0: maybe The thing is it's difficult to say because pornography is pretty much free on the internet.

181
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:18,180
Speaker 0: But then again, that's because it's all pirated and the porn people fight to ought to get their stuff off the pirate network.

182
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,047
Speaker 1: That's a big problem with the porn right?

183
00:13:20,127 --> 00:13:25,420
Speaker 1: Is that like, you know, you got a porn site and you charge money for the porn But you want people to come to it.

184
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,713
Speaker 1: So you take some porn and you put it out there for free.

185
00:13:27,733 --> 00:13:31,992
Speaker 0: that has your logo all over it But that's probably enough for that says enough for most people.

186
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:33,277
Speaker 1: so they never come and pay.

187
00:13:33,297 --> 00:13:37,169
Speaker 0: so Scott they come they just don't pay.

188
00:13:37,812 --> 00:13:42,560
Speaker 1: if you don't put any porn out there for free No one will ever come to your site to pay for anything because they won't even know it exists.

189
00:13:43,062 --> 00:13:44,949
Speaker 0: I can't believe I'm at a cum joke on the air.

190
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:45,531
Speaker 1: Hey great.

191
00:13:45,832 --> 00:13:47,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're not on any air or on wires.

192
00:13:48,301 --> 00:13:48,964
Speaker 0: No, we're on air.

193
00:13:48,984 --> 00:13:50,349
Speaker 0: Okay, we can be on air.

194
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:51,574
Speaker 0: There's wireless routers of me.

195
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:57,424
Speaker 0: You have to pay for them anyway, so apparently Twitter is dead.

196
00:13:57,444 --> 00:13:59,309
Speaker 0: It is no longer innocent.

197
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,751
Speaker 1: live Twitter.

198
00:14:00,092 --> 00:14:01,235
Speaker 0: It's the end of the internet.

199
00:14:01,376 --> 00:14:02,680
Speaker 0: It's the end of micro blogs.

200
00:14:03,163 --> 00:14:07,794
Speaker 0: They've destroyed it because someone fished on Twitter.

201
00:14:09,301 --> 00:14:15,886
Speaker 0: Yes, I'm gonna quote from the person who put this on slashdot Culture crash blogger blah blah.

202
00:14:15,906 --> 00:14:18,112
Speaker 0: blah says this is the end of Twitter's innocence.

203
00:14:18,453 --> 00:14:22,540
Speaker 0: will tweets become like email with two out of every three just worthless spam?

204
00:14:23,326 --> 00:14:26,882
Speaker 0: wait a minute on One hand.

205
00:14:27,644 --> 00:14:38,100
Speaker 0: no Twitter and things like Twitter can't become like that for one simple reason You only see the tweets that you subscribe to the people you were friends with.

206
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,440
Speaker 0: It's a white list by default system as opposed to email, which is a blacklist by default system.

207
00:14:43,942 --> 00:14:50,429
Speaker 1: Yep, so even if there are mad spammers on Twitter if you don't follow them You will never see their spam ever.

208
00:14:50,569 --> 00:14:55,976
Speaker 0: only get spammed on Twitter if you follow idiots Follow spammers or are an idiot.

209
00:14:56,338 --> 00:15:06,800
Speaker 0: Yep So in this guy mean basically all that happened here was someone Started compromised someone's account and started sending, you know private tweets to a whole bunch of people and a private, you know.

210
00:15:06,941 --> 00:15:08,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a good way to do it.

211
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:12,233
Speaker 0: those tweets looked legitimate even though I don't think I could be fooled by.

212
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:22,958
Speaker 0: why would someone send me a tweet with a link to The login to Twitter and why would I follow that login which has clearly the wrong URL Type in my credentials and then not worry about it when it doesn't work?

213
00:15:23,466 --> 00:15:32,760
Speaker 0: hmm but apparently a bunch of people did and those people's accounts got compromised and It spread all over the place and people are losing their shit over this and one.

214
00:15:33,443 --> 00:15:35,773
Speaker 0: The internet was not terribly innocent to begin with.

215
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,320
Speaker 0: it was just that in the old day.

216
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,409
Speaker 0: It's kind of like in the early days of the internet.

217
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,760
Speaker 0: There was the AOL like walled garden.

218
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,816
Speaker 0: That was kind of like the Byzantine Empire with their walls around them hiding from the bar.

219
00:15:45,836 --> 00:15:46,780
Speaker 0: Dark Ages around them.

220
00:15:47,182 --> 00:15:48,147
Speaker 0: Except was the opposite.

221
00:15:48,207 --> 00:15:50,359
Speaker 0: They'd walled the Dark Ages in and wouldn't let him out.

222
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,600
Speaker 0: But then everyone in the real internet was like the Wild West in the early days.

223
00:15:57,922 --> 00:16:01,040
Speaker 0: They all had guns and didn't trust each other for shit.

224
00:16:02,283 --> 00:16:14,048
Speaker 0: It's still how it is Except now a lot of people are wandering out into the Wild West with their little carpet bags And they're going into the saloon and they give a put $100 in on the bar And they're like how much for a whiskey partner.

225
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,740
Speaker 1: and then someone comes and blows their brains out and takes their money.

226
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:20,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the internet was never innocent and Twitter was never innocent.

227
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,740
Speaker 1: But if you want to walk around in this wasteland, you better know Hokuto no Ken or know somebody does.

228
00:16:26,322 --> 00:16:28,709
Speaker 0: But or else I don't see how this is news.

229
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,913
Speaker 0: anyone could have done this.

230
00:16:30,013 --> 00:16:37,758
Speaker 0: It's it's not you know, this is only news Because it happened over Twitter, which I notice and the internet cares about.

231
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:41,436
Speaker 1: that's something I've noticed a lot in just in tech news lately.

232
00:16:41,456 --> 00:16:41,838
Speaker 1: Is that?

233
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,404
Speaker 1: What is actually news?

234
00:16:44,464 --> 00:16:45,528
Speaker 1: doesn't make the news.

235
00:16:45,548 --> 00:17:02,640
Speaker 1: the only things that make news are if you have an important word for example, like Something that is like the stupidest story in the universe But has the word Apple in it will be like at the top or has the word Google in it or the word Microsoft in it or if it has a big word in it then it gets to the top even if it's a worthless news.

236
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,380
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, very very important news that does not have any of those big words and it will not rise to the top.

237
00:17:08,521 --> 00:17:10,674
Speaker 1: And so basically this is a piece of crap.

238
00:17:10,714 --> 00:17:10,996
Speaker 1: news.

239
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:13,165
Speaker 1: fishing Fishing isn't news.

240
00:17:13,226 --> 00:17:19,940
Speaker 1: fishing has been around everything is being fished banks are being fished Everything in the world is being fished and idiots still fall for it.

241
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,656
Speaker 1: It's not news, but the word Twitter's in it's always at the top of the news.

242
00:17:24,098 --> 00:17:25,122
Speaker 0: big deal Oh my god.

243
00:17:25,282 --> 00:17:26,909
Speaker 0: Twitter Apple tweet Apple.

244
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:28,836
Speaker 0: Twitter jobs to it tweet Twitter.

245
00:17:29,218 --> 00:17:44,042
Speaker 0: Yep Of course this brings up another issue that I Guess Twitter is starting to become more mainstream Because I've never met a competent technologist who could ever be fooled by fishing Like it.

246
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:48,897
Speaker 0: just you can't be fooled unless the site you were going to is already compromised directly.

247
00:17:49,258 --> 00:17:53,112
Speaker 0: You really Really have to go out of your way to get fished.

248
00:17:53,534 --> 00:17:56,224
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's it's pretty hard It's sort of like.

249
00:17:56,786 --> 00:18:06,040
Speaker 1: I mean I could sort of understand, you know people falling for fake medicine You know because a lot of them are really deceptive with their you know, fake medicine ads that are just outright.

250
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:09,450
Speaker 0: But if I go to Geico dot co.

251
00:18:09,511 --> 00:18:15,755
Speaker 0: dot uz And it has a green Geico logo and like a red misspelled login.

252
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:17,320
Speaker 0: I don't think that's gonna get me.

253
00:18:17,621 --> 00:18:20,952
Speaker 1: No, besides why would someone want to log into your car insurance?

254
00:18:21,093 --> 00:18:23,060
Speaker 0: Well, my car insurance is also my credit card.

255
00:18:23,523 --> 00:18:25,535
Speaker 0: Yeah, even though it's actually on a separate site.

256
00:18:25,575 --> 00:18:26,380
Speaker 0: but yeah.

257
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:30,511
Speaker 0: But anyway, actually plus it's trivial to prevent fishing.

258
00:18:30,551 --> 00:18:37,288
Speaker 0: if you're a big institution like all my banks and my credit cards and everything When I log in one it asks me for my username.

259
00:18:37,348 --> 00:18:41,620
Speaker 0: All right, I type that in and then it prompts me for something.

260
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,071
Speaker 0: It's not just something I know, you know.

261
00:18:44,091 --> 00:18:47,025
Speaker 0: get the factors of security something I have something I know something I am.

262
00:18:47,045 --> 00:18:57,320
Speaker 0: it also has something, you know You know, I log into my bank and first it shows me a picture of something I'm not gonna tell you what it is clearly and then it asks me a question.

263
00:18:57,661 --> 00:19:04,271
Speaker 0: So not only does the bank make me prove who I am before it lets me in but it makes itself prove to me Who it is.

264
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:13,586
Speaker 1: Yep So it's like, you know You're going a fishing is when you go to a website and you think that website is your bank's website But it's not your bank's website.

265
00:19:13,626 --> 00:19:14,630
Speaker 1: It's some other website.

266
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,620
Speaker 1: So how do you prove to your bank that you're you?

267
00:19:17,801 --> 00:19:19,070
Speaker 1: That's how you get into your account.

268
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:20,460
Speaker 1: is you give them your name and password?

269
00:19:21,123 --> 00:19:24,900
Speaker 1: But your bank has to prove to you that it's your bank and isn't some fake website.

270
00:19:25,101 --> 00:19:29,498
Speaker 1: So it shows you this picture and stuff and websites need to do this.

271
00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:36,880
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean the only other option is like a secure ID open ID kind of thing all those RSA style keys.

272
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,446
Speaker 0: That's pretty much unbreakable.

273
00:19:38,486 --> 00:19:40,855
Speaker 0: But again, all those things can be brought around.

274
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,120
Speaker 1: I got to order those YubiKey thing.

275
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:42,563
Speaker 1: Yes, you do.

276
00:19:42,623 --> 00:19:43,488
Speaker 1: So I got away with it.

277
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,119
Speaker 0: And I kind of I kind of want to.

278
00:19:46,042 --> 00:19:47,460
Speaker 0: I'm trying to convince my work.

279
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:52,640
Speaker 0: Basically, they said if I get it working for like local stuff and I show to them they might be willing to dump the RSA.

280
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:57,094
Speaker 1: You might have to code something for it, but you don't have to pay for the RSA server anymore.

281
00:19:57,114 --> 00:20:04,020
Speaker 0: Yeah the cost of RSA Minus the cost of all the development time it would take to set up everything to use this instead.

282
00:20:04,781 --> 00:20:10,592
Speaker 0: I mean, I even have this crazy idea of giving it to clients like they can get premium secure service.

283
00:20:11,534 --> 00:20:17,440
Speaker 0: Oh Crazy idea, but I got a. I got to sell it to people.

284
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:25,410
Speaker 0: So I got a. I got to get YubiKeys and make sure they actually no one will log into your pipeline and trade stock in your name Even though it's pretty much impossible to do that.

285
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:28,963
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I know I know But you know people.

286
00:20:29,264 --> 00:20:34,925
Speaker 1: if you charge like a small fee for people but will pay for it World of Warcraft did it and it Works brilliantly.

287
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,634
Speaker 1: Yeah, those are RSA keys, aren't they?

288
00:20:37,097 --> 00:20:38,824
Speaker 0: I think so I don't know pretty sure.

289
00:20:38,865 --> 00:20:41,274
Speaker 0: while made a deal well blizzard made a deal with RSA.

290
00:20:41,294 --> 00:20:42,860
Speaker 1: I don't know who's RSA or someone else?

291
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:50,759
Speaker 0: Yeah, all I know is that the people who buy them are people whose accounts were actually Compromised usually due to no shady action on their part.

292
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,522
Speaker 1: Right makes.

293
00:20:51,562 --> 00:21:02,160
Speaker 1: the vast majority of compromised accounts on things like myspace or Facebook or Wow are people who have stupid Guessable passwords and their friends guess them or they tell someone their path.

294
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:11,399
Speaker 0: Oh the other I think the other half equally valid are people who use the same login ID and password for everything that too and Then they make an account on something shady or poorly maintained.

295
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:14,465
Speaker 0: Mmm, you compromise that you've compromised everything.

296
00:21:14,826 --> 00:21:27,683
Speaker 0: Yep, but I feel like if Blizzard has such an easily breakable system I mean, it depends on how they're being compromised and then Blizzard offers you the ability to pay Protection money.

297
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,509
Speaker 0: No, that's kind of shady.

298
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:30,471
Speaker 1: Yeah.

299
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,033
Speaker 1: Yeah.

300
00:21:31,675 --> 00:21:33,923
Speaker 0: But anyway, I got one more quick news I want to.

301
00:21:33,943 --> 00:21:34,971
Speaker 0: I want to point this out.

302
00:21:35,234 --> 00:21:36,000
Speaker 0: I'd like to do a whole.

303
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:50,117
Speaker 0: I realize this should be turned in kind of a whole show about electricity power grids not the game internet and all this sort of stuff, but There's this article on slashdot about distributed nuclear batteries as the new like electrical grid infrastructure.

304
00:21:50,157 --> 00:21:53,940
Speaker 0: The idea is that you bury Nuclear batteries in quotes.

305
00:21:54,060 --> 00:22:00,760
Speaker 0: I'll get to that in like every little neighborhood and then have all these like small entry points into the grid.

306
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,140
Speaker 1: Wouldn't it be more efficient to just have nuclear power plants?

307
00:22:05,149 --> 00:22:14,791
Speaker 1: Yes, I Mean centralized is always more efficient than distributed as long as you're not losing more over the power lines than you're gaining by Being more efficient at the generation.

308
00:22:15,112 --> 00:22:15,273
Speaker 0: Yeah.

309
00:22:15,314 --> 00:22:18,208
Speaker 0: Well, I didn't read the whole article yet But they test the man you have to do there.

310
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,520
Speaker 0: The real issue here is that they say batteries.

311
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,651
Speaker 0: But if you read the article, they're not actually nuclear batteries.

312
00:22:23,671 --> 00:22:25,055
Speaker 0: Those are a real thing that exists.

313
00:22:25,517 --> 00:22:26,480
Speaker 0: They're kind of awesome.

314
00:22:26,922 --> 00:22:28,848
Speaker 0: I wish civilians could get their hands on them.

315
00:22:29,109 --> 00:22:31,137
Speaker 0: I would kill for a nuclear power laptop.

316
00:22:31,177 --> 00:22:31,960
Speaker 1: They're really heavy.

317
00:22:32,401 --> 00:22:37,918
Speaker 0: They are really heavy, but you know what if my laptop weighed 10 pounds, but I only had to charge it once every 10 years?

318
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:47,920
Speaker 1: Okay, I'd rather have it weigh five pounds in five years, you know what I'd be happy with a year.

319
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:53,012
Speaker 0: But these aren't actually nuclear batteries.

320
00:22:53,313 --> 00:22:59,673
Speaker 0: they're basically small Self-contained nuclear reactors much like the kinds we're trying to use in Africa.

321
00:23:00,215 --> 00:23:01,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're pretty cool for that purpose.

322
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:09,120
Speaker 0: They are but I don't feel like this is a good idea yet because we haven't even got Yucca Mountain up and running.

323
00:23:09,501 --> 00:23:18,948
Speaker 0: So we're still gonna have to do something with these things and there's a lot of issues with transporting nuclear quote-unquote waste across state Lines, I said there's something about nuclear waste.

324
00:23:18,968 --> 00:23:20,092
Speaker 1: I still understand right.

325
00:23:20,413 --> 00:23:24,430
Speaker 1: if it's if it's dangerous That means it's still radioactive right?

326
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:28,545
Speaker 1: There's this nasty shit coming out of it Nasty shit coming out of it.

327
00:23:29,167 --> 00:23:33,000
Speaker 1: then it can generate electricity somehow because there's energy being released.

328
00:23:33,302 --> 00:23:41,960
Speaker 1: Let me make this even more confusing because all right If there is no energy being released of it from it in the form of radio radioactivity, then it's not dangerous.

329
00:23:42,242 --> 00:23:44,738
Speaker 0: Let me make this even more confusing for you.

330
00:23:45,221 --> 00:23:53,466
Speaker 0: Think about it this way the more radioactive something is the more alpha beta or gamma or whatever radiation Photon something are coming out of it.

331
00:23:53,646 --> 00:24:02,319
Speaker 0: Yep, the more and so more energy and or mass is being emitted from it Mm-hmm, the faster it's giving that up the shorter its half-life is.

332
00:24:03,263 --> 00:24:07,358
Speaker 0: The shorter its half-life is the less time it spends being dangerous.

333
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:16,760
Speaker 0: Yep So nuclear radiation and nuclear waste is kind of a self-limiting thing and You can also usually get power out of it and you know what?

334
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:22,060
Speaker 0: The answer is in France and in civilized countries where they continue to build nuclear power plants.

335
00:24:22,662 --> 00:24:29,599
Speaker 0: They have power plants that are designed to use refined nuclear waste to generate further energy and make less dangerous ways.

336
00:24:30,601 --> 00:24:32,347
Speaker 1: Yes modern technology.

337
00:24:32,547 --> 00:24:34,795
Speaker 1: Well, we won't see that for 50 years even better.

338
00:24:35,477 --> 00:24:39,172
Speaker 1: for anyone who's unaware I mean look how long it took us to get the cell phone from the Japanese.

339
00:24:39,292 --> 00:24:44,880
Speaker 0: the majority of nuclear waste is Generated by a nuclear facility is what's termed low-grade nuclear waste.

340
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:56,252
Speaker 0: you know things like gloves and suits and detectors and construction materials and those things are Barely radioactive and it doesn't even take them that long to be no longer dangerous.

341
00:24:56,974 --> 00:24:58,940
Speaker 1: So then it's just goop and rocks.

342
00:25:00,222 --> 00:25:02,379
Speaker 0: Well, no, it's mostly gloves and things.

343
00:25:03,781 --> 00:25:08,445
Speaker 0: It's basically the stuff that you have to store for you know, 10 20 years and then dump it in a landfill or recycle it Or whatever.

344
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:09,054
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm

345
00:25:10,563 --> 00:25:25,740
Speaker 0: I think this is an interesting article because one thing I could see is that this would be a good kind of backup solution or a kind of intermediary solution for you know We do have the problem now that there are a small number of very big points of failure in the US power grid.

346
00:25:26,245 --> 00:25:27,620
Speaker 0: I mean remember the Northeast blackout.

347
00:25:28,042 --> 00:25:35,353
Speaker 1: I think it would just be cool to just we should just make a bunch of them just have them on hand and then you Know if there's an emergency or something just drive the trucks out.

348
00:25:35,776 --> 00:25:40,419
Speaker 1: or even better Take them or put one in a truck and drive it somewhere then plug it in.

349
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,677
Speaker 0: Yeah, or why don't we use these this technology more widely in places like Africa?

350
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,065
Speaker 1: that well We are I guess trying.

351
00:25:48,086 --> 00:25:48,708
Speaker 1: someone's trying.

352
00:25:48,728 --> 00:25:51,057
Speaker 0: Yeah, we should do it more instead of using them here.

353
00:25:51,077 --> 00:25:53,305
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Don't know.

354
00:25:53,325 --> 00:25:54,963
Speaker 0: It's an interesting article I didn't I?

355
00:25:55,566 --> 00:25:58,540
Speaker 0: I would have a lot more to say about it than I can fit into a little news bit.

356
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,107
Speaker 0: So I wanted to point it out.

357
00:26:00,147 --> 00:26:04,200
Speaker 0: I want you all to read about this stuff and some Monday We'll do a show about the power grid.

358
00:26:04,522 --> 00:26:06,814
Speaker 0: I'm gonna try to find some expert to correct us when we're wrong.

359
00:26:07,216 --> 00:26:07,779
Speaker 1: Good luck with that.

360
00:26:14,305 --> 00:26:26,580
Speaker 0: but anyway things of the day and speaking of electronics or electricity or the power grid Have you ever when I was a kid like one thing my parents gave me was this giant set of electrical components.

361
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:33,540
Speaker 0: It was like transformers and plugs like extension cords and light bulbs and adapters and fuses and it wasn't ever intended.

362
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,330
Speaker 0: I could never make anything out of it because I wasn't allowed to plug it all in.

363
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:39,100
Speaker 0: but I had all these things.

364
00:26:39,842 --> 00:26:49,239
Speaker 0: And when I was really really young what I was obsessed with Was plugging something into an outlet and then plugging the other end of that somehow into another outlet.

365
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:51,572
Speaker 0: really I didn't know what it would do.

366
00:26:51,592 --> 00:26:58,100
Speaker 0: I was like five But I thought it would be a cool idea and this was like the goal of many of my young experiment.

367
00:26:58,161 --> 00:26:59,479
Speaker 1: I never thought that was a good idea.

368
00:27:00,381 --> 00:27:00,883
Speaker 0: So I would like.

369
00:27:00,943 --> 00:27:18,188
Speaker 0: I was trying to make like little adapters and I was trying to do all this stuff and of course because I didn't have a soldering iron, you know, I was five there was no configuration I could put together that would allow this to come to pass Which was lucky because I would often plug my things in when no one was looking And then my parents would come and unplug it and tell me not to do that.

370
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:29,943
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, but it turns out I as a five-year-old was about as smart as a lot of 30 40 year olds because apparently a Certain department store.

371
00:27:29,963 --> 00:27:37,687
Speaker 0: Well, not a department store hardware store got so many requests for a dual headed Power-card or power adapter.

372
00:27:37,767 --> 00:27:40,073
Speaker 1: What would you possibly need one for that?

373
00:27:40,113 --> 00:27:46,464
Speaker 0: They put up a sign saying hey assholes No There's a picture of this.

374
00:27:46,484 --> 00:27:47,267
Speaker 0: you got to see this thing.

375
00:27:47,307 --> 00:28:04,800
Speaker 0: apparently the primary reason people want these is that They have poorly thought-out their Christmas light plans and have ended up with two Backends of Christmas light strands facing each other and want a nice easy adapter to plug them in.

376
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,081
Speaker 1: What?

377
00:28:06,422 --> 00:28:08,770
Speaker 1: wait a minute now, that's not possible.

378
00:28:09,151 --> 00:28:10,857
Speaker 0: Oh, it is possible, but I will say this.

379
00:28:10,957 --> 00:28:11,900
Speaker 1: How is it possible?

380
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:12,742
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

381
00:28:12,762 --> 00:28:13,284
Speaker 0: How is that possible?

382
00:28:13,345 --> 00:28:14,270
Speaker 0: How is that not possible?

383
00:28:15,013 --> 00:28:19,386
Speaker 1: I mean Christmas light All Christmas light.

384
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:22,120
Speaker 0: well most Christmas lives except for the triple long strands.

385
00:28:22,865 --> 00:28:28,440
Speaker 0: We'll have that Shoddy looking thing that plugs into the wall that has the adapter in the front of it to plug something else into the outlet

386
00:28:28,701 --> 00:28:28,963
Speaker 1: yeah,

387
00:28:29,365 --> 00:28:35,917
Speaker 0: and at the other end of the strand will have the Female adapter into which to plug in a second strand of lights,

388
00:28:36,138 --> 00:28:36,440
Speaker 1: correct?

389
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,845
Speaker 0: so people would plug this male adapter in.

390
00:28:40,105 --> 00:28:45,127
Speaker 0: now I point out that if they plug the male adapter in and They've already got the Christmas lights plugged in.

391
00:28:45,589 --> 00:28:47,296
Speaker 0: They just made a deadly weapon right there.

392
00:28:47,316 --> 00:28:50,154
Speaker 0: if they survive this They've already made it further than I would expect.

393
00:28:50,174 --> 00:28:55,794
Speaker 0: Yeah But then they could plug that end into the next strand of Christmas lights and power them from the rear.

394
00:28:55,814 --> 00:28:55,874
Speaker 0: Yep.

395
00:28:56,376 --> 00:29:09,699
Speaker 0: I Just want to point out if you end up plugging, you know You haven't died yet and you plug the other end of this into another outlet somehow or if the other end of this Which is also a lethal weapon touches anything?

396
00:29:10,502 --> 00:29:11,746
Speaker 0: Well, uh not gonna end.

397
00:29:11,766 --> 00:29:15,056
Speaker 0: Well, I can't believe this sign was necessary.

398
00:29:15,717 --> 00:29:18,593
Speaker 0: I feel like basic electronics much like.

399
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:24,291
Speaker 1: I don't know Electronics here, we're not even at electricity here.

400
00:29:24,311 --> 00:29:26,039
Speaker 1: We're at plugging something in.

401
00:29:26,923 --> 00:29:28,208
Speaker 1: You don't know how to plug things in.

402
00:29:28,288 --> 00:29:31,460
Speaker 1: but the holes Jerry the holes, I don't know.

403
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,520
Speaker 0: I feel more and more like public high schools.

404
00:29:33,944 --> 00:29:37,099
Speaker 0: You should be able to opt out of these classes Like if you take a test.

405
00:29:37,601 --> 00:29:48,660
Speaker 0: But if you can't pass a test, I feel like there should be a class in high school called how to not suck at Life after high school and it should teach you this should be elementary school how to plug things.

406
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,002
Speaker 1: No,

407
00:29:49,142 --> 00:29:52,399
Speaker 0: it's got to be high school because otherwise people will forget

408
00:29:53,012 --> 00:29:53,238
Speaker 1: Yeah

409
00:29:54,341 --> 00:30:04,519
Speaker 0: It's got to be like how to plug stuff in what a checkbook is and how to use it What a savings account is not to use it what a credit card is and why you shouldn't have one if you're in this class.

410
00:30:05,321 --> 00:30:08,656
Speaker 0: No, I'm gonna turn on a gas stove without killing yourself.

411
00:30:08,957 --> 00:30:13,497
Speaker 1: Yeah Man, I had to put that like class in a bunker somewhere.

412
00:30:13,658 --> 00:30:17,567
Speaker 1: That's safe You know people go turn on the gas stove.

413
00:30:17,707 --> 00:30:20,115
Speaker 0: Oh, I just imagine the practicum at the onion.

414
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:24,393
Speaker 0: before you graduate your senior Water they lock you in a room.

415
00:30:24,434 --> 00:30:25,300
Speaker 0: They shut the door.

416
00:30:25,721 --> 00:30:32,020
Speaker 0: There is a Bunsen burner a lighter and a beaker and if you can boil the water without dying you get to go to college.

417
00:30:32,342 --> 00:30:37,370
Speaker 1: All right, you get to go to community college Hall Road high.

418
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,157
Speaker 0: So what do you have for me?

419
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:43,780
Speaker 1: It's just a funny song by one of our favorite funny song bands the arrogant worms.

420
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,666
Speaker 1: But someone made a little animated video to it.

421
00:30:45,727 --> 00:30:46,208
Speaker 1: It's funny.

422
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:47,332
Speaker 0: Which one is this?

423
00:30:47,352 --> 00:30:49,560
Speaker 1: This is the the song of assumptions.

424
00:30:50,243 --> 00:30:53,496
Speaker 0: Oh, I almost used that as my thing of the day before I saw this gem.

425
00:30:53,516 --> 00:30:54,520
Speaker 0: That was my thing at the day.

426
00:30:55,201 --> 00:30:56,224
Speaker 1: Yeah, the song.

427
00:30:56,966 --> 00:31:01,720
Speaker 1: you get a lot of assumptions when you listen to the song, but your assumptions are not correct.

428
00:31:03,281 --> 00:31:05,086
Speaker 0: Ra Ra Ri kick him in the knee.

429
00:31:05,106 --> 00:31:09,478
Speaker 1: Ra Ra Ras kick him in the other knee in the ass.

430
00:31:09,778 --> 00:31:15,620
Speaker 0: No, I Just remember that one RT hockey game.

431
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:21,809
Speaker 0: We're doing the Ra Ra Ri dead thing and a guy was like Ra Ra Ri Kick him in the knee and the whole crowd's yelling.

432
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:24,660
Speaker 0: and there was Ra Ra Ras and the really loud guy.

433
00:31:24,901 --> 00:31:29,200
Speaker 0: You know just kick him in the and the loud guy yells as loud and long as possible.

434
00:31:36,123 --> 00:31:36,608
Speaker 1: It's a good one.

435
00:31:37,032 --> 00:31:40,134
Speaker 0: so uh We couldn't come up with what to do the show on.

436
00:31:40,395 --> 00:31:41,100
Speaker 1: No, we suck.

437
00:31:41,601 --> 00:31:48,023
Speaker 0: We had like ten ideas, but they're all like think about it a little bit have a have a plan and then do the show Episode ideas.

438
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:55,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, so even though I guess a lot of people have discussed this already We've discussed it in the forums a whole bunch.

439
00:31:55,923 --> 00:31:58,274
Speaker 1: It's a kind of a hot topic lately.

440
00:31:58,314 --> 00:32:01,353
Speaker 1: Maybe we should talk about the netbooks Kind at least somewhat.

441
00:32:01,373 --> 00:32:09,400
Speaker 0: it Amazes me to this day that it took as long as it did for a product like that to be made and sold in quantity.

442
00:32:09,781 --> 00:32:11,004
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean well think about this.

443
00:32:11,064 --> 00:32:21,543
Speaker 1: right you had computers and computers kept getting faster and better and stronger with more see faster CPUs more RAM more hard drive space more everything Right.

444
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,614
Speaker 1: and every aspect of computing got more powerful.

445
00:32:24,654 --> 00:32:26,400
Speaker 1: and you know the prices kept going down.

446
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,170
Speaker 1: So you can always get more power for the same amount of money.

447
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:37,194
Speaker 1: and as that went on consumer level Applications because you know real applications always need more power.

448
00:32:37,234 --> 00:32:53,285
Speaker 1: but consumer level applications Always needed more, you know, these games are too slow, you know these 3d games It's you know, even just saving this Word document takes a while, you know, it just everything, you know It need to get faster.

449
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,248
Speaker 1: the Internet's too slow.

450
00:32:54,288 --> 00:32:56,978
Speaker 1: Look it takes me like 10 minutes to sign into AOL.

451
00:32:56,998 --> 00:33:01,438
Speaker 1: This sucks and things got better and better and better.

452
00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:14,748
Speaker 1: and Then eventually sometime like, you know a couple years ago ish maybe two or three years ago, you know cable modems DSL We're everywhere, you know, we had Pentium fours AMD Use around that time.

453
00:33:14,848 --> 00:33:17,400
Speaker 0: like Wi-Fi started to become completely ubiquitous.

454
00:33:17,661 --> 00:33:21,051
Speaker 0: I mean right now they're like six access points within range of our house.

455
00:33:21,071 --> 00:33:23,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, everyone's got laptops with Wi-Fi, right?

456
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,848
Speaker 1: people didn't really need More horsepower than they had.

457
00:33:28,908 --> 00:33:29,390
Speaker 1: I mean people.

458
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:29,812
Speaker 1: what do they do?

459
00:33:29,852 --> 00:33:33,045
Speaker 1: They go to YouTube they go to Facebook They go to myspace.

460
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:33,828
Speaker 1: they brought.

461
00:33:34,089 --> 00:33:36,860
Speaker 1: most of the stuff people do is in the web browser.

462
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:43,867
Speaker 1: So if you were computer can run Firefox or Internet Explorer Can run flash right in the web browser.

463
00:33:43,887 --> 00:33:46,394
Speaker 0: I use links and can play.

464
00:33:46,715 --> 00:33:48,179
Speaker 1: it can play videos and music.

465
00:33:48,199 --> 00:33:53,420
Speaker 1: and You know PC games, you know, everyone talks about the crisis, right?

466
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:59,367
Speaker 1: But no one really plays that most people play, you know Even Wow has barely any system requirements.

467
00:33:59,407 --> 00:34:03,859
Speaker 1: half-life 2 portal these sorts of games have barely any system requirements.

468
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:13,500
Speaker 1: So Even if you're a gamer if you're not super crazy into the very high You know system requirement games, you don't even need that much horsepower.

469
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:23,540
Speaker 1: So most people the vast majority of people using computers no longer need Faster computers than what they've got and they won't for a while

470
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:35,150
Speaker 0: but not even just that look specifically at portable devices because the the scope of what people will do on the go is Far lower far smaller than what they will do at home.

471
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,780
Speaker 0: I mean when you're in Starbucks, what are you gonna do?

472
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,620
Speaker 0: You want to check your email go to Google Maps and find a restaurant?

473
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,998
Speaker 0: Email, you know get on Twitter and tell people that you're about to go take a shit and all that stuff.

474
00:34:46,482 --> 00:34:50,500
Speaker 1: You're not gonna sit down and play, you know NS in a Starbucks.

475
00:34:51,042 --> 00:34:51,643
Speaker 0: I did that.

476
00:34:51,704 --> 00:34:58,090
Speaker 1: some people play like that recently, you know, you might play like Wow for a minute or two But even then system requirements not too high.

477
00:34:58,191 --> 00:35:00,120
Speaker 0: Well Wow doesn't run so well on the netbooks.

478
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:00,864
Speaker 1: No, it doesn't.

479
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:02,231
Speaker 0: but but there's.

480
00:35:02,271 --> 00:35:02,854
Speaker 0: they're kind of like.

481
00:35:02,874 --> 00:35:03,960
Speaker 1: this depends on the netbook.

482
00:35:04,142 --> 00:35:05,780
Speaker 1: Actually, you might get it to go for a little bit.

483
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:11,260
Speaker 1: You won't be able to do like a. you know a huge thing, but maybe you can sign in and yeah, they're Wow mail.

484
00:35:12,601 --> 00:35:17,307
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah the time as time went on and as time is going on there's been more and more like the.

485
00:35:17,609 --> 00:35:32,440
Speaker 0: the technology gap between high-end on-the-go use and average on-the-go use has broadened to the point that we have $400 little Netbooks that have three hour batteries and do everything the average person will ever want to do in Starbucks.

486
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,066
Speaker 1: Yeah, because see here's what happened right.

487
00:35:34,167 --> 00:35:42,182
Speaker 1: there were always well almost always tiny laptops But they were ultra portables like the ones we have or like the ones you know Cool people have.

488
00:35:42,202 --> 00:35:44,007
Speaker 1: and what an ultra portable is.

489
00:35:44,027 --> 00:35:51,540
Speaker 1: it's when you take an incredibly powerful laptop like a full power laptop We're talking core to duo full-on, right?

490
00:35:52,081 --> 00:36:01,240
Speaker 1: But you shrink all the parts you should make everything really small and you put it in a tiny package and You put like two batteries in there.

491
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:06,096
Speaker 1: So the battery lasts forever and the screen is small but the screen is very high resolution.

492
00:36:06,116 --> 00:36:07,260
Speaker 1: It's a high quality screen.

493
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:12,159
Speaker 1: So basically you get the best stuff in the world and you make it real in this but also the smallest stuff.

494
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:16,060
Speaker 1: So you get a long battery life high horsepower?

495
00:36:16,761 --> 00:36:24,361
Speaker 1: Low weight laptop and the result is something that costs like $2,000 and maybe even $3,000.

496
00:36:24,361 --> 00:36:30,420
Speaker 1: The other way you can go is you can just get some piece-of-shit computer parts and don't even bother miniaturizing them.

497
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,775
Speaker 1: They're so shitty that it doesn't take any effort to put them in a tiny package.

498
00:36:33,795 --> 00:36:34,880
Speaker 1: and they're so shitty and slow.

499
00:36:35,222 --> 00:36:36,630
Speaker 1: They don't use that much electricity.

500
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,159
Speaker 1: So you don't need to put two batteries in there.

501
00:36:38,521 --> 00:36:44,765
Speaker 1: just put one normal shitty battery in there to last forever because it's barely using the battery and You know who cares.

502
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:48,660
Speaker 1: the screen is high resolution, it's like 800 by 600. that's good enough for freaking people.

503
00:36:48,741 --> 00:36:50,778
Speaker 1: they don't you know, no high resolution from what.

504
00:36:50,798 --> 00:36:56,914
Speaker 1: and You know people bought into it and it does what most people do.

505
00:36:56,934 --> 00:36:58,840
Speaker 1: and it's surprising because I look at a netbook.

506
00:36:58,961 --> 00:37:03,122
Speaker 1: It's like I couldn't live off of one but a lot of people can plus.

507
00:37:03,182 --> 00:37:10,959
Speaker 0: honestly if I hadn't bought an ultra portable like if I if I didn't make as much money as I do and I wasn't And I wasn't doing the things on the computer that I do.

508
00:37:11,503 --> 00:37:13,273
Speaker 0: But I needed more than a netbook like.

509
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,340
Speaker 0: I needed a real computer.

510
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:33,720
Speaker 0: I'd either have like the super powerful Desktop and the netbook what I carry on the train and around the city in my pocket basically in my tiny little bag Yeah, or I'd have you know, my PC at home I'd have the you know moderately priced powerful laptop that I bring like on trips or like when I'm going somewhere big.

511
00:37:34,424 --> 00:37:36,818
Speaker 0: But then I'd have the netbook that I carry with me everywhere.

512
00:37:37,582 --> 00:37:42,726
Speaker 0: Yeah, because the normal laptop plus netbook is far cheaper than Actual.

513
00:37:42,867 --> 00:37:45,744
Speaker 0: good small, you know ultra portable I mean you can get.

514
00:37:45,824 --> 00:37:52,220
Speaker 1: I bought my parents like a Dell 15-inch full-on laptop as good as it You know a full desktop computer basically.

515
00:37:52,280 --> 00:38:00,526
Speaker 1: But in a laptop and it was like $800 and a netbook is like $200 and my laptop That's an ultra portable is $2,000.

516
00:38:00,526 --> 00:38:05,140
Speaker 1: so I can get for two netbooks and two normal laptops or one ultra portable.

517
00:38:05,521 --> 00:38:18,740
Speaker 0: Yep, now, of course the ultra portable really does serve all the purposes like it is the best possible laptop Unless you were one of those people who travels all the time and needs to do complex 3d rendering on the go.

518
00:38:19,341 --> 00:38:25,539
Speaker 0: Then you need one of those big, you know, like 17 inch honking laptops, which I really don't see too many people doing.

519
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:27,259
Speaker 1: that I mean Really?

520
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:37,650
Speaker 0: I do For the like the game 3 or 3d rendering when you were at home I can see the use for the gaming laptop.

521
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,520
Speaker 0: to what if I went to a whole ton of land parties.

522
00:38:40,721 --> 00:38:42,380
Speaker 1: You know, it's a whole ton of land parties.

523
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:47,780
Speaker 1: But even then if I went to that many land parties like you buy a dedicated land box exactly.

524
00:38:47,941 --> 00:38:52,440
Speaker 1: I would get like a high-powered box in a high-powered desktop.

525
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:56,139
Speaker 1: But in this very small box like micro ATX or something, you got to carry the screen.

526
00:38:56,782 --> 00:39:06,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I want that screen because see the main thing about a lot for gaming right is the fact that when you have a Laptop, even a gaming laptop the screen is attached to the computer.

527
00:39:06,861 --> 00:39:08,388
Speaker 1: So you can't have the keyboard.

528
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,740
Speaker 1: when you move the keyboard you're moving the monitor.

529
00:39:11,181 --> 00:39:17,080
Speaker 1: You say I don't move the keyboard when I'm playing a game, but you're forced to have it in this particular orientation.

530
00:39:17,301 --> 00:39:19,514
Speaker 1: Also a laptop keyboard is really bad.

531
00:39:19,554 --> 00:39:20,520
Speaker 0: You know what I can say this.

532
00:39:20,681 --> 00:39:24,920
Speaker 0: I did actually play NS in a Starbucks not that long ago because it runs just fine on my ultra portable.

533
00:39:25,341 --> 00:39:26,485
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you know what?

534
00:39:27,348 --> 00:39:27,890
Speaker 0: It was great.

535
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:29,215
Speaker 1: Did you have a big?

536
00:39:29,235 --> 00:39:30,419
Speaker 1: did you plug the mouse into it?

537
00:39:30,499 --> 00:39:31,825
Speaker 0: Yes I plugged a mouse into it.

538
00:39:31,845 --> 00:39:33,714
Speaker 0: Yeah, you guys you got it.

539
00:39:33,734 --> 00:39:34,879
Speaker 0: I've been using the geek night's mouse.

540
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,497
Speaker 1: Yeah, you also, you know a set an external keyboard would help a lot too.

541
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:43,191
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah I'm thinking about buying a little Bluetooth mouse just for my laptop for when I'm on the go.

542
00:39:43,251 --> 00:39:47,099
Speaker 0: but at the same time when I'm on the go and I need A mouse I just bring the geek night's mouse.

543
00:39:47,380 --> 00:40:04,775
Speaker 1: Yeah, even so the thing is that they do make like computers that are sort of you know The in-between desk like you can go buy from Dell like these things that like sort of fold up computers that are like their desktops Yeah, but then like the monitor comes out and separates a bit and they make things like that.

544
00:40:04,795 --> 00:40:05,799
Speaker 1: I think Sony makes one, too.

545
00:40:07,021 --> 00:40:09,189
Speaker 0: But I mean there there are some uses for those things.

546
00:40:09,209 --> 00:40:17,999
Speaker 0: but in the end I see like most techie people I know They need an ultra portable and they either can't afford one or aren't or real or will not spend the money on one.

547
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:18,854
Speaker 0: even they Can't afford it.

548
00:40:19,407 --> 00:40:24,495
Speaker 0: But otherwise Like netbooks are awesome and I feel like more and more people are gonna buy them.

549
00:40:24,535 --> 00:40:30,580
Speaker 0: and I don't think the argument I've been seeing in the media that netbooks are taking off because the economy is poor is true.

550
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:36,480
Speaker 1: No, it's not because if you look, you know things like the XO PC and that stuff, right?

551
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:44,699
Speaker 1: That was they were trying to make laptops, you know for like, you know the poor parts of the world where there are countries that do not have high quality economies to begin with.

552
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:49,777
Speaker 1: and Then they sort of realized in doing that that regular old people want this too.

553
00:40:49,857 --> 00:40:51,645
Speaker 1: and it was actually They.

554
00:40:51,686 --> 00:40:53,100
Speaker 1: people have wanted this kind of thing.

555
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,409
Speaker 1: It's one of those things or people want it, but they didn't know.

556
00:40:55,449 --> 00:40:58,180
Speaker 1: they wanted it right because they were ultra portables.

557
00:40:58,562 --> 00:41:01,135
Speaker 1: But no one except nerds bought ultra portables.

558
00:41:01,195 --> 00:41:02,080
Speaker 1: No one even knew about them.

559
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:07,620
Speaker 1: They'd see your laptop and go holy shit that small because they never seen anything so small because it was never marketed to them.

560
00:41:08,162 --> 00:41:14,687
Speaker 1: and the idea of having an incredibly small laptop didn't even occur to people because they just sort of Laptops are about 15 inches.

561
00:41:14,707 --> 00:41:15,310
Speaker 1: That's the size.

562
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:17,980
Speaker 1: They are, you know, they didn't think about these things.

563
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,920
Speaker 1: They didn't realize that they really wanted a small, you know laptop that was light and had long battery life.

564
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,809
Speaker 1: They you know, so when they went to the store and they looked they were like, well, these are all big That one's got a big ol impressive screen.

565
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:32,160
Speaker 1: I'll get that one not really thinking about it.

566
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,080
Speaker 0: Well think if you don't know it's not obvious that ultra portables exist.

567
00:41:36,503 --> 00:41:39,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I mean like how did I buy my Fujitsu?

568
00:41:39,181 --> 00:41:43,419
Speaker 0: I had to go to the Fujitsu website and buy it from them.

569
00:41:44,441 --> 00:41:55,392
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the only ultra portables you're gonna see are like it may be a Dell maybe The MacBook Air which is still a little big inches wise even though it's thin.

570
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:56,756
Speaker 0: It's also really heavy.

571
00:41:57,258 --> 00:41:58,020
Speaker 1: Is it really that heavy?

572
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:58,946
Speaker 0: Yeah, we got one at work.

573
00:41:59,289 --> 00:42:00,619
Speaker 1: I thought it was supposed to be light.

574
00:42:01,723 --> 00:42:03,801
Speaker 0: It's really heavy for how small it is Like.

575
00:42:04,403 --> 00:42:08,940
Speaker 1: ah, I think my laptop weighs less and you'll see some Sony ones, which are not so great.

576
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:12,780
Speaker 1: But you know, you're not gonna and the prices are gonna be way high.

577
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:22,660
Speaker 1: you're not gonna consider them and they don't look impressive next to the other ones because You have to actually know what you're doing to realize that it's fucking awesome because it's a whole lot of power in a little package.

578
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,240
Speaker 1: So the fact that now right you got the netbooks, right?

579
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:33,819
Speaker 1: Not only the netbooks cheap which draws anyone's eye no matter what the economy is, right?

580
00:42:35,642 --> 00:42:37,950
Speaker 1: But they put them in the stores where everyone can see them.

581
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:42,126
Speaker 1: they market the hell out of them and they're actually like Cheaper than any desktop.

582
00:42:42,146 --> 00:42:44,737
Speaker 1: You're gonna see that the cheapest computer you can get period.

583
00:42:45,279 --> 00:42:49,439
Speaker 1: you know It's like if they can make a netbook for two hundred three and three hundred dollars.

584
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,347
Speaker 1: Where's the $100 desktop, right?

585
00:42:52,709 --> 00:42:55,298
Speaker 0: Yeah, the MacBook Air weighs a little over three pounds.

586
00:42:55,519 --> 00:43:01,600
Speaker 1: Oh, wow Yeah, so I'm still wondering like the hundred dollar desktops are because I think that a lot of people would go for those as well.

587
00:43:01,681 --> 00:43:06,630
Speaker 0: I think the reason there are no hundred dollar desktops it's the same reason why hard drives don't really get cheaper.

588
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:14,970
Speaker 0: because if people always think hey if I can buy a 500 gigabyte drive for a hundred bucks How come I can't buy a hundred gigabyte drive for five bucks?

589
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:17,479
Speaker 0: is it's still made of metal because it costs this?

590
00:43:17,539 --> 00:43:19,480
Speaker 0: like Physically, it's pretty much the same.

591
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:26,017
Speaker 0: So once they make a process to make bigger drives if I make a 500 gigabyte drive It doesn't cost any more to make than a 100 gigabyte.

592
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:38,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like even a. you know, the cheapest shittiest desktop computer still comes in a case Right with a motherboard and manufacturing time on a factory line and metal and soldering and all that business.

593
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:40,687
Speaker 1: Oh that business that the price is not really.

594
00:43:41,409 --> 00:43:45,380
Speaker 1: you can't push it down that much just because using you know cheapo parts.

595
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:45,821
Speaker 1: That's also

596
00:43:45,842 --> 00:44:01,113
Speaker 0: the reason why used computers never really come down in price so much because used computers are either unreliable Or take more time to make reasonably reliable then like the time it takes to put them back together by someone who knows Costs more than just buying a new cheap computer.

597
00:44:01,153 --> 00:44:02,580
Speaker 1: That's why you see already faster.

598
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:16,866
Speaker 1: Yeah That's why you see a lot of these places that you just bring your old computers to and then they take the working parts build new working computers of all the spare parts from broken old ones and then install Linux on them and given to poor people because There's really nothing else you could do with them.

599
00:44:17,548 --> 00:44:18,331
Speaker 0: Do we have anything else?

600
00:44:18,833 --> 00:44:19,715
Speaker 0: We have anything at all?

601
00:44:19,736 --> 00:44:21,320
Speaker 1: I Don't know.

602
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:31,260
Speaker 1: I think that it's just kind of weird how it took so long for netbooks to come around and it's strange that you know For the first time we don't have software pushing hardware as much.

603
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:37,160
Speaker 1: I mean even in like the console gaming department right where it's always been this race and race and race.

604
00:44:37,481 --> 00:44:43,920
Speaker 1: We're now gonna see we're probably gonna see a lot longer lifecycle on the current generation than any previous gaming generation.

605
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:54,820
Speaker 0: and well because we're kind of hitting a lot of limits where things Like a lot of gameplay things got to the point where more technology does not really make for more game experience.

606
00:44:55,042 --> 00:44:56,674
Speaker 1: It's like you have a 4d game.

607
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:58,805
Speaker 1: not really It's like right.

608
00:44:59,167 --> 00:45:04,842
Speaker 1: It's it's really hard to push things farther than we've got them at least software wise You know.

609
00:45:04,862 --> 00:45:06,005
Speaker 1: and it's it's.

610
00:45:06,186 --> 00:45:11,500
Speaker 1: and even so it doesn't make a significant difference when you do audio software like audition.

611
00:45:12,083 --> 00:45:14,574
Speaker 0: Audition doesn't really do much more than cool.

612
00:45:14,614 --> 00:45:16,861
Speaker 0: Edit did in the year 2000.

613
00:45:16,861 --> 00:45:19,173
Speaker 0: Yeah, like 2000 2001 like it does more.

614
00:45:19,474 --> 00:45:28,380
Speaker 0: this technology has advanced But it's advanced so little that you're never gonna have like audio applications for editing audio that are pushing the limit of computers.

615
00:45:29,401 --> 00:45:29,843
Speaker 0: That's true.

616
00:45:29,863 --> 00:45:36,540
Speaker 0: I mean it's got to the point where I can do like real-time Britney Spears a fine And all right, what am I gonna do beyond that with audio?

617
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:38,571
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's kind.

618
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:41,399
Speaker 1: It's like You reach a limit where it's like any.

619
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,646
Speaker 1: Our imaginations are.

620
00:45:43,666 --> 00:45:46,299
Speaker 1: what's limiting us, you know, we can't think of another thing to do.

621
00:45:46,862 --> 00:45:47,886
Speaker 1: It's not that we can't do.

622
00:45:47,926 --> 00:45:58,660
Speaker 1: it is we don't know what to do and the only things that we can think to do Right are like supercomputer things that supercomputers are doing, you know, like simulating all the weather on the entire earth.

623
00:45:59,302 --> 00:45:59,945
Speaker 1: It's like all right.

624
00:45:59,985 --> 00:46:01,853
Speaker 1: What next simulate the entire universe?

625
00:46:01,914 --> 00:46:02,155
Speaker 1: All right.

626
00:46:02,195 --> 00:46:04,590
Speaker 1: Well, we're sort of done then What are you gonna do beyond that?

627
00:46:04,731 --> 00:46:11,658
Speaker 0: Uh, well, well I don't want to get into the simulation argument because if it's possible to simulate the entire universe, did you create the another universe?

628
00:46:11,938 --> 00:46:27,720
Speaker 0: Yes Haha Luckily though the way out of that paradox for anyone who knows, you know Really like thinks about that paradox The way out is that it is possible that to simulate the entire universe Takes the amount of energy that it takes to run the entire universe.

629
00:46:28,241 --> 00:46:33,600
Speaker 1: Also in simulating an entire universe you'd have to simulate a simulation of the entire universe which would fail.

630
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:37,046
Speaker 0: Maybe anyway, I think we're done.

631
00:46:37,066 --> 00:46:42,985
Speaker 0: I Was thinking of leaving the hospital.

632
00:46:43,065 --> 00:46:49,311
Speaker 0: I I applied to a whole bunch of jobs and I was like I looked at different things and I even considered just like getting out of IT entirely.

633
00:46:49,331 --> 00:47:05,433
Speaker 0: and I started looking at a lot of Tech journalism and I like I started sending my resume to newspapers and people like that and for a lot of places They would ask me to send a writing sample on the condition that I would relinquish my rights to the writing sample And then they could publish it if they wanted.

634
00:47:05,453 --> 00:47:16,090
Speaker 0: Yeah Actually a little over a year ago wrote an article for and a certain I can't reveal who Outfit about how netbooks are the future.

635
00:47:16,351 --> 00:47:19,624
Speaker 0: the first person to make one is gonna be so freaking rich like that.

636
00:47:19,644 --> 00:47:19,925
Speaker 0: is it?

637
00:47:20,247 --> 00:47:27,680
Speaker 0: netbooks are everything and they're coming and I'm gonna look after the show and see if I can find if someone actually ever published that.

638
00:47:28,581 --> 00:47:29,887
Speaker 1: Yeah, that'd be pretty cool.

639
00:47:29,948 --> 00:47:31,776
Speaker 0: They never even called me back after I sent it in.

640
00:47:31,796 --> 00:47:34,086
Speaker 1: now They're probably just looking for some free stuff.

641
00:47:34,146 --> 00:47:34,869
Speaker 0: Yeah, they were.

642
00:47:34,889 --> 00:47:37,600
Speaker 0: they were kind of kind of shady and low-end anyway.

643
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:42,736
Speaker 0: Yeah, like most tech journalism is if it's not on I guess the one or two sites.

644
00:47:42,756 --> 00:47:45,064
Speaker 0: I actually go to yeah Yeah, all right.

645
00:47:45,104 --> 00:47:46,109
Speaker 0: I think we're done.

646
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:46,912
Speaker 1: Yeah, we got nothing.

647
00:47:46,933 --> 00:47:48,540
Speaker 1: Let's go to bed go to bed.

648
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:54,020
