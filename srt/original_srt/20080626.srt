1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,689
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, June 26th.

2
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:12,572
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,752 --> 00:00:18,100
Speaker 0: I'm rim, and this is geek nights tonight the darkness that comes before.

4
00:00:25,882 --> 00:00:31,254
Speaker 1: Let's do this Well here.

5
00:00:31,294 --> 00:00:33,682
Speaker 1: We are it's Thursday and like we said way back.

6
00:00:33,702 --> 00:00:36,090
Speaker 1: We're continuing with the the lounge.

7
00:00:36,251 --> 00:00:37,537
Speaker 1: I guess Thursdays are different.

8
00:00:37,557 --> 00:00:38,400
Speaker 1: Thursdays are special.

9
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,430
Speaker 1: Thursdays are not your typical episode of geek nights.

10
00:00:41,013 --> 00:00:44,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're in wanted a cop-out of doing the promised book.

11
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:51,634
Speaker 0: I did not want to come bring up many excuses about people not reading not wanting to talk about all three books there But I'm forcing it.

12
00:00:51,674 --> 00:00:53,764
Speaker 0: We're gonna do the book club as planned.

13
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:57,663
Speaker 0: at the end of this episode We're gonna tell you what the next book is gonna be to clarify.

14
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,210
Speaker 1: I was not attempting to cop out.

15
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:08,909
Speaker 1: I was merely noting that our Original plan of having a roundtable and other plans we had to do this show kind of fell through because no one actually Wanted to do that.

16
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:29,512
Speaker 0: Oh you see I actually went back and I listened to the dodgeball episode last Thursday's episode where we talked where we said that we were going to do the book club the second book club episode right now and We said very specifically that we couldn't have that whole roundtable unless you were going to talk about all three books because people would Spoil it up.

17
00:01:29,592 --> 00:01:31,218
Speaker 0: the would not yeah.

18
00:01:31,238 --> 00:01:31,318
Speaker 1: Well.

19
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:32,181
Speaker 1: We could have had it.

20
00:01:32,241 --> 00:01:34,970
Speaker 1: We would had to pick very handcrafted people.

21
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:39,629
Speaker 0: Yes, so because they're only gonna talk about the one book the round table is not gonna happen.

22
00:01:40,232 --> 00:01:42,382
Speaker 1: But regardless we're going to continue.

23
00:01:42,443 --> 00:01:44,507
Speaker 0: the round table might happen in the future But not right now.

24
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:48,566
Speaker 1: We're gonna do it at some point because I have a lot to say about these books and I can people.

25
00:01:48,607 --> 00:01:59,070
Speaker 0: I. just the main reason I want to have it is not because I feel like I want to say a lot, but just because All these people in the front row crew can't shut up about it.

26
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:00,417
Speaker 0: I want it that one everyone.

27
00:02:00,437 --> 00:02:02,930
Speaker 0: just get it out of their system all at once.

28
00:02:03,152 --> 00:02:05,209
Speaker 0: Well, you can shut up and maybe read some other books.

29
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:12,970
Speaker 1: What's been happening with the Prince of Nothing is that it's read by like a group a couple people And then it gets read by this other wave of people.

30
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:30,639
Speaker 1: There's other wave of people and like six waves of this have been rolling through the front row crew and as a result The books are always topical and every time the crew gets together Someone who has just started reading the book will always get the conversation with someone who read it before Along the lines of you have no idea.

31
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:33,270
Speaker 1: all man when so-and-so did such and such.

32
00:02:33,632 --> 00:02:35,950
Speaker 1: Oh wait, oh so and so does the thing I can't tell you about.

33
00:02:36,652 --> 00:02:38,077
Speaker 0: Why do you think it is here?

34
00:02:38,097 --> 00:02:42,410
Speaker 0: let's let's start our book club discussion of the darkness that comes before by our Scott backer.

35
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:45,378
Speaker 0: Why do you think it is that these books?

36
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:48,670
Speaker 0: I mean, we've read a lot of books in common, right plenty of them.

37
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,178
Speaker 0: We've read plenty of books in our lives.

38
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,270
Speaker 0: I mean, why is it that these books?

39
00:02:54,234 --> 00:03:02,410
Speaker 0: Get so much Conversation and so much desire to have conversation with others who have read it among our crew and other people.

40
00:03:02,692 --> 00:03:04,990
Speaker 1: It's weird how unhesitant I am to say this.

41
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:10,748
Speaker 1: I mean people who know me more more closely than maybe through geek nights might know this.

42
00:03:10,768 --> 00:03:17,388
Speaker 1: but the rest of you I'm very finicky about all my entertainment and I generally dislike almost every entertaining thing.

43
00:03:17,468 --> 00:03:18,070
Speaker 1: I'm confronted.

44
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,798
Speaker 0: Yeah, people act like I'm the one who's all hating on.

45
00:03:20,838 --> 00:03:24,209
Speaker 0: everything is actually the one who's hating but I don't hate on.

46
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,910
Speaker 1: I just Note that I do not find a lot of things terribly engaging.

47
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:30,410
Speaker 0: So I guess the difference is it's mo.

48
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,909
Speaker 0: I think that that actually is mostly in the expression like when you don't like something.

49
00:03:33,929 --> 00:03:34,796
Speaker 0: you're like I don't like that.

50
00:03:34,816 --> 00:03:36,209
Speaker 0: when I don't like something I say it sucks.

51
00:03:37,112 --> 00:03:37,996
Speaker 1: You go one step further.

52
00:03:38,036 --> 00:03:38,278
Speaker 1: It's like.

53
00:03:38,358 --> 00:03:40,570
Speaker 1: I say I didn't particularly enjoy that.

54
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,573
Speaker 1: I think it was poorly written.

55
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:46,128
Speaker 1: you say it sucks and you're all stupid for liking it and I hate you.

56
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,292
Speaker 1: and I had sex With your mom.

57
00:03:47,654 --> 00:03:50,646
Speaker 0: I think I stopped like two and a half steps shorter than that.

58
00:03:50,726 --> 00:03:54,299
Speaker 1: But yeah Well, you skip to the big finish with the mom and whatnot.

59
00:03:54,579 --> 00:04:01,356
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I think for one I. but like I said, I'm Surprisingly unhesitant to say this.

60
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:05,210
Speaker 1: but these books are well written to a degree that was startling.

61
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:12,514
Speaker 0: yeah, I don't know exactly what it is, but it's like What I'm reading them.

62
00:04:12,995 --> 00:04:15,321
Speaker 0: It's not just the choice of words.

63
00:04:15,341 --> 00:04:22,040
Speaker 0: Well, I guess it is just the choice of words technically speaking but The way in which it is written right?

64
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,770
Speaker 0: It's sort of like when I read a Tezuka manga, right?

65
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:32,090
Speaker 0: It's like the combination of the words and the graphics creates this sort of, you know cinematic kind of experience, right?

66
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:42,320
Speaker 0: But there's something about the way he writes the words in these books where I can sort of almost get that same Cinematic experience during some scenes.

67
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:44,930
Speaker 0: Well this I wouldn't get it a lot of other books.

68
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,594
Speaker 0: Just don't give.

69
00:04:45,815 --> 00:04:48,250
Speaker 1: that brings up pretty much the foremost reason.

70
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:56,190
Speaker 1: I think that these are so well written the thing that really stands out and you look at like other fantasy works like Tolkien and A lot, you know that things are very descriptive.

71
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,299
Speaker 1: It'll go on and on about how the detail token is.

72
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:03,370
Speaker 0: very tokens very sort of flowery and prosy and and poetry wise.

73
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,673
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah But in general a lot of.

74
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:10,389
Speaker 1: he also is very exquisite he fills things with detail that I ended up skipping a lot of.

75
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:11,428
Speaker 1: I'll admit openly.

76
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:15,407
Speaker 0: I think there's the people who go a lot more into the intro.

77
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:17,234
Speaker 0: detail There are.

78
00:05:17,314 --> 00:05:21,247
Speaker 1: I'm trying to keep this show express perhaps to some certain deceased people.

79
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:28,719
Speaker 1: possibly Yeah, but anyway with wheels The wheels I want a heron blade.

80
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:31,668
Speaker 1: so much so badly what at least I dare and fear good God.

81
00:05:31,788 --> 00:05:32,450
Speaker 0: heron spear.

82
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:34,465
Speaker 1: I think the heron spear beats out the heron blade.

83
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:37,133
Speaker 0: Well Heron spears the wind.

84
00:05:37,153 --> 00:05:37,895
Speaker 0: Okay.

85
00:05:38,216 --> 00:05:39,700
Speaker 1: Anyway, but they're not.

86
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:43,110
Speaker 1: they're very very descriptive these books and this writing.

87
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:52,217
Speaker 1: but they're not descriptive in the kind of Expected way of you describe in stupid detail the color of this and the relief here and this and that.

88
00:05:52,257 --> 00:05:55,799
Speaker 1: and there were five Leaves on this tree that was almost out of leaves.

89
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:01,894
Speaker 0: Well, I think I think that is one reason where you know, I'm usually sorry I mean, I like me a fantasy book.

90
00:06:01,915 --> 00:06:08,685
Speaker 0: don't get me wrong but I think a lot of the fantasy books and a lot of fantasy fandom in general is Really heavy on this.

91
00:06:08,987 --> 00:06:10,111
Speaker 0: on the idea of setting.

92
00:06:10,332 --> 00:06:13,745
Speaker 0: they want detail in the setting, you know What kind of they like.

93
00:06:13,765 --> 00:06:16,980
Speaker 0: they like, you know, I mean look at the Forgotten Realms type stuff.

94
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,305
Speaker 0: Where are all the how?

95
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:19,590
Speaker 0: what's the map of the town?

96
00:06:19,871 --> 00:06:21,156
Speaker 0: You know, where are all the buildings?

97
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,300
Speaker 0: What are the people like?

98
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,200
Speaker 1: Fantasy authors tend to get really caught up in their own world.

99
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,846
Speaker 0: They do they do but it's all it's.

100
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:30,215
Speaker 0: it ends up being more about the world.

101
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:33,220
Speaker 1: Whereas which would be fun I mean, there's nothing wrong with the story about the world.

102
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,115
Speaker 1: I think it's just that they get caught up in the world and focused on the world.

103
00:06:37,577 --> 00:06:51,134
Speaker 0: and a lot of Poorly written fantasy novels tend to focus on the details that no one else cares about whereas in the prince of nothing Series there is a world and it is as big a world as there are in.

104
00:06:51,154 --> 00:07:03,460
Speaker 0: so in those other fantasy novels that are world-heavy you know, I mean look you have this holy war marching right and There are this this giant Empire release different kingdoms and each Kingdom has different people.

105
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,120
Speaker 0: This is the one Kingdom where the people that wear masks.

106
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:09,635
Speaker 0: There's the other Kingdom where the guys are sort of like Highlanders.

107
00:07:09,977 --> 00:07:21,355
Speaker 1: almost well well, actually we don't really need to get into this but the the nations of the world are very Explicitly and directly based upon cultures from certain eras in history in that area.

108
00:07:21,395 --> 00:07:24,343
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's sort of obvious Scythians and such.

109
00:07:24,383 --> 00:07:25,447
Speaker 0: Yes, but they don't.

110
00:07:25,627 --> 00:07:27,213
Speaker 0: actually they don't.

111
00:07:27,253 --> 00:07:34,487
Speaker 0: he doesn't spend a lot of words Describing to you like, you know These are the so-and-so's from the so-and-so.

112
00:07:34,528 --> 00:07:38,400
Speaker 0: He sort of just throws the proper nouns out there, right?

113
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,493
Speaker 0: He just names the people and he's like.

114
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:52,440
Speaker 0: he's like yeah These are those people the so-and-so people and you just you see them and it's like the so-and-so people Walked into the room with their shrank heads hanging from ropes around their waist.

115
00:07:52,581 --> 00:07:56,940
Speaker 0: So it's like ah, so those are sort of more, you know barbaric kind of guy.

116
00:07:57,262 --> 00:07:59,211
Speaker 1: I think part of that is that as a result you end up.

117
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:02,899
Speaker 1: you learn a lot about the world Naturally as though you were there.

118
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:07,013
Speaker 1: It's like if you were in this world and you did not know these things.

119
00:08:07,214 --> 00:08:11,985
Speaker 1: you would learn about them in this kind of natural way just from Speaking and talking.

120
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:16,820
Speaker 1: and the dialogue in these books is very natural with one great exception.

121
00:08:16,981 --> 00:08:22,843
Speaker 1: But that exception is callous and it's actually very which makes it very unnatural I think.

122
00:08:22,863 --> 00:08:28,314
Speaker 0: the other thing is that this book right I look at the books, you know And you take like say a literature class.

123
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:29,040
Speaker 0: How do you write a book?

124
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,500
Speaker 0: Well, you could write a book in the first person, you know, you could write a book from a narrator.

125
00:08:32,561 --> 00:08:34,039
Speaker 0: It could have an unreliable narrator.

126
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,381
Speaker 0: You could have.

127
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:37,426
Speaker 0: you know all these different ways to write a novel.

128
00:08:37,486 --> 00:08:41,366
Speaker 0: right the way this these books are written is You have an unreliable.

129
00:08:41,405 --> 00:08:42,832
Speaker 0: Well, they're not really.

130
00:08:42,852 --> 00:08:44,580
Speaker 0: it's not really an unreliable narrator.

131
00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:48,080
Speaker 0: It is a reliable narrator, but the narrator changes.

132
00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:53,072
Speaker 0: it's always in the first person but who that person is changes and whatever.

133
00:08:53,312 --> 00:08:58,870
Speaker 0: you'll go through the book and you'll be reading and say it's From the point of view of a came in a commune.

134
00:08:59,432 --> 00:09:10,419
Speaker 0: then you'll see like dot dot dot and then suddenly You're picking right up and it's from the point of view of Nair and then this dot dot dot and maybe or maybe the next Chapter and it's from the point of view of Esmina.

135
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:20,934
Speaker 1: now This is very important and there's a lot of subtlety in what happens as a result because one there is no objective narrator I mean the closest thing to an objective narrator you have is callous.

136
00:09:21,074 --> 00:09:25,798
Speaker 1: the nominal protagonist Even though I would argue that a came in is the protagonist of these books.

137
00:09:27,247 --> 00:09:27,678
Speaker 0: Well, you know what?

138
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:29,224
Speaker 1: I'll go one step further.

139
00:09:29,806 --> 00:09:39,734
Speaker 1: the Prince of Nothing series the darkness that comes before and these other two books They break a lot of the tropes of literature and that it's difficult to say.

140
00:09:40,256 --> 00:09:43,586
Speaker 1: if there even is a protagonist Yeah, it is.

141
00:09:43,627 --> 00:09:44,009
Speaker 0: Definitely.

142
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,640
Speaker 0: I mean at least in the class.

143
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,440
Speaker 0: I mean, there are a lot of ways criteria you can use to determine, you know, who's the main character?

144
00:09:50,942 --> 00:09:53,575
Speaker 0: It's like who says there has to be a main character.

145
00:09:53,595 --> 00:09:56,500
Speaker 0: this main characters They're all sort of equal, you know.

146
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:06,340
Speaker 0: Which is why I think it actually gives me a really sort of Burning wheel kind of feel or like, you know any sort of good tabletop RPG where there is no main character.

147
00:10:06,521 --> 00:10:11,600
Speaker 0: It's the people, you know, the actual PCs as opposed to the NPCs are the player characters.

148
00:10:11,721 --> 00:10:16,200
Speaker 0: They're all equal protagonists and everyone else is a non player character.

149
00:10:16,401 --> 00:10:21,560
Speaker 1: This is where the subtlety comes in and I don't think it could have been pulled off from any other perspective.

150
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:26,154
Speaker 1: But you only ever see this world through the perspectives of the characters.

151
00:10:26,174 --> 00:10:28,260
Speaker 1: You're always inside their heads.

152
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:33,740
Speaker 1: So whenever a scene is described one you're getting it from this one character's perception.

153
00:10:33,941 --> 00:10:40,960
Speaker 1: So everything is kind of filtered through them and you see their experiences and most of the narration is not objective.

154
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,542
Speaker 1: He did this.

155
00:10:41,582 --> 00:10:42,465
Speaker 1: she did that it's.

156
00:10:43,107 --> 00:10:44,572
Speaker 1: I saw him do this.

157
00:10:45,194 --> 00:10:46,780
Speaker 1: I see him doing that.

158
00:10:47,182 --> 00:10:50,460
Speaker 0: It's weird how one second you could be in a character's head, right?

159
00:10:50,660 --> 00:11:07,920
Speaker 0: You know seeing everything they think seeing everything they see see hearing everything they hear The next second you'll be in another character's head in the same scene looking at the character you were just inside of and Not in and sort of questioning like, oh, what's that guy up to?

160
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:13,400
Speaker 0: It's like I was just in his head and now I'm questioning what he's up to Even though I just was in there and I saw what he was thinking.

161
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:29,813
Speaker 1: But I guess this the importance of this is that the whole idea of Kellis and what Kellis is I don't think could have been done eloquently or with any true justice if not for this switching of perspective because you kind of everyone's perspective is flawed.

162
00:11:30,174 --> 00:11:41,844
Speaker 1: and then you hit Kellis and his perspective is Perfect which is frightening a lot of the time because the world is so completely and utterly different and alien from his perspective Compared to everyone else's.

163
00:11:42,466 --> 00:11:50,628
Speaker 0: I think what's also amazing about the way calluses written is that he's written so As to be so transhumanist to be so.

164
00:11:50,869 --> 00:11:54,340
Speaker 0: it's like he has superpowers beyond you know, what people have.

165
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,133
Speaker 0: It's not something that a human being in the real world can do.

166
00:11:57,193 --> 00:11:58,800
Speaker 0: It's almost beyond comprehension.

167
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,887
Speaker 1: Transhuman is definitely the word out.

168
00:12:00,907 --> 00:12:03,194
Speaker 1: the Hannibal Lecter is very close to Kellis.

169
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:15,220
Speaker 0: yet when you're in his mind Seeing what he sees thinking what he thinks hearing what he hears you can comprehend it, you know You sir, it's it's plain as day and it's plainly obvious of what's going on.

170
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,717
Speaker 0: And you know, but there's actually thinking what's he's doing.

171
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:21,968
Speaker 0: yet How can you comprehend it when it's so far above you?

172
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:33,513
Speaker 0: and it's it really traps your mind in a way because you're in his head There's a brilliant scene that actually it's almost as if he is, you know Fooling you inside of his own head like he knows you're there.

173
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:35,966
Speaker 1: Oh, I'll talk about that in a second But there's a brilliant scene.

174
00:12:35,987 --> 00:12:39,346
Speaker 1: It's actually in one of the later books, so I won't Speak on it.

175
00:12:39,387 --> 00:12:45,996
Speaker 1: But all I want to say is that Nayer the barbarian he is awesome, but also not awesome.

176
00:12:46,196 --> 00:12:49,219
Speaker 1: He's awesome in the way that mr Tokai is awesome beside the point.

177
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:55,520
Speaker 1: But whenever you're in calluses head all of his planning and like his courses of action seem obvious.

178
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,628
Speaker 1: in fact, they seem almost predestined.

179
00:12:57,669 --> 00:12:59,596
Speaker 1: like what other choice could he have made?

180
00:13:00,018 --> 00:13:10,432
Speaker 1: but then later you're in Nayer's head and he is in a situation that you would expect Kellis to be in and Nayer trying to figure out what to do.

181
00:13:10,452 --> 00:13:17,300
Speaker 1: I have the same Information that Kellis had when I was in Kellis had about about a similar situation.

182
00:13:17,642 --> 00:13:22,113
Speaker 1: But now I'm in Nayer's head and not only can Nayer not figure out what to do But I can't figure out what to do.

183
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:30,480
Speaker 1: Yep It's pretty amazing but in terms of fooling because you're in from everyone's perspectives one You you get very intimated with all of the characters.

184
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:33,400
Speaker 1: I mean you by the end of the especially by the end of the trilogy.

185
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:39,260
Speaker 1: I I you feel as though you know these characters in a very visceral sense.

186
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,760
Speaker 1: I know what see it's like I know them really well, but I don't identify them with them.

187
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,046
Speaker 0: Well, I don't identify with them.

188
00:13:45,126 --> 00:13:48,160
Speaker 0: But well, I identify with parts of each, you know.

189
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,520
Speaker 0: It's sort of like I'll listen to some podcasts out there.

190
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:58,670
Speaker 0: They have like a cast, you know They have a lot more than two hosts and it's like there's no one person on the cast Which I identify with but like one person.

191
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:03,935
Speaker 0: I'll really identify with them on one aspect But I'll disagree with them on some other aspect, you know, and the Princeton.

192
00:14:03,955 --> 00:14:04,860
Speaker 0: nothing's the same way.

193
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:16,280
Speaker 0: it's like Nayer his his untrustingness of Kellis and His refusal to be fooled and he's in his skepticism and his seeing right through the bullshit.

194
00:14:16,462 --> 00:14:30,140
Speaker 1: I totally identify with his Barbarism and other such not identify, but remember there's a difference between understanding a character Identifying with the character and feeling as though you know a character.

195
00:14:30,742 --> 00:14:41,600
Speaker 1: Because by being in their heads by being in all the I mean if it was just the whole book was from one character's Perspective in one character's head then you would be intimate with this character But it wouldn't be apparent and it wouldn't mean anything.

196
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,695
Speaker 1: But the fact that you're in everyone's heads you start to.

197
00:14:46,137 --> 00:14:46,538
Speaker 1: there's all.

198
00:14:46,558 --> 00:15:11,578
Speaker 1: there's this beautiful tragedy to say something that a nonman would say in that you'll see a character and in there will be in their head and they want something desperately from another character or they love this character and then you're in this other character's head and they love the first character and yet when you're in a third character's head and you see these two Interacting you realize what's going on, but you're powerless to stop it.

199
00:15:12,484 --> 00:15:37,855
Speaker 1: Mmm-hmm, like, you know You're more intimate with the characters than any of them ever could be with each other with the possible exception of again a Scene from the third book where someone is reading a book about the ancient histories of the world You know the original apocalypse and then this is a little nod of the people who've read all three books and then Realizes exactly who another character was and what he meant and what he what he was.

200
00:15:37,935 --> 00:15:49,695
Speaker 0: but it was almost too late Too late, all right, so let's let's start getting some nitty-gritty so that first I got we got to talk about Alright, let's go to some big scenes and then talk about their meanings inside.

201
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:52,940
Speaker 1: Yes, let's skip over the ones We talked about right away in the world.

202
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,085
Speaker 0: Did we talk about we?

203
00:15:54,105 --> 00:15:57,380
Speaker 0: did we talk about the whole issue all thing in the beginning the very very beginning?

204
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,790
Speaker 1: I believe we did but we could talk about that again.

205
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:02,040
Speaker 1: is that if nothing else.

206
00:16:03,081 --> 00:16:08,040
Speaker 1: This is one of those books where the you know, call me Ishmael the opening sentence.

207
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,545
Speaker 0: I never read the color.

208
00:16:09,705 --> 00:16:10,649
Speaker 0: Oh, I know nevermind.

209
00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:11,772
Speaker 1: What were you gonna say?

210
00:16:12,294 --> 00:16:13,117
Speaker 1: What were you gonna say?

211
00:16:13,217 --> 00:16:14,020
Speaker 1: Call me Ishmael.

212
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,328
Speaker 0: I was like I was like at first.

213
00:16:16,428 --> 00:16:18,816
Speaker 0: I was like I got confused.

214
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:21,491
Speaker 0: I was like, oh, yeah I never read that book called call me Ishmael.

215
00:16:21,511 --> 00:16:29,150
Speaker 1: It's like no, wait a minute One cannot raise walls against what has been forgotten.

216
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:33,000
Speaker 1: Yeah that that line is very very important.

217
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:33,824
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right.

218
00:16:33,844 --> 00:16:37,280
Speaker 0: So the book opens right and basically it's the end of the world.

219
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,952
Speaker 0: But it's it's they call it the end of the world.

220
00:16:38,972 --> 00:16:40,160
Speaker 0: It's an apocalypse, right?

221
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,591
Speaker 0: But it's not the real end of the world where everyone dies.

222
00:16:42,671 --> 00:16:44,540
Speaker 0: It's just lots of horrible shit going.

223
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:50,499
Speaker 1: It's almost like in a way this book begins where at the point where a lot of fantasy books would skip.

224
00:16:51,381 --> 00:16:56,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, see that's one of those things where I'm always upset with pretty much every fantasy trilogy.

225
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:07,157
Speaker 0: I mean you read the Lord of the Rings but all the big Unpowered stuff with hundreds of dragons and hundreds of balrogs and tons of wizards and all that craziness happened way before.

226
00:17:07,219 --> 00:17:13,440
Speaker 0: I Disagree with your idea that those books would be good because I don't think I'm not saying they would be good.

227
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,338
Speaker 0: I'm just saying I always want them.

228
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:20,940
Speaker 0: Yeah You want them because the good books you want that make you want those other books that aren't bad.

229
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:21,964
Speaker 1: You want that.

230
00:17:22,003 --> 00:17:23,650
Speaker 1: you really do you want that?

231
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,656
Speaker 0: No, but I will give you a book.

232
00:17:25,696 --> 00:17:26,319
Speaker 0: you want that.

233
00:17:26,521 --> 00:17:30,940
Speaker 1: Yes, but I will give you a book that will make you realize that that is not price of dragon lands book.

234
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:35,036
Speaker 1: In fact, I was going to say the dragon lands books probably notice.

235
00:17:35,056 --> 00:17:36,000
Speaker 0: I don't like those books.

236
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:39,468
Speaker 1: Those books are some of the worst Good god.

237
00:17:39,548 --> 00:17:39,952
Speaker 0: Well, they're no.

238
00:17:40,033 --> 00:17:48,100
Speaker 0: Ethan from Guy goes down a hill in a sled and hurts himself.

239
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:52,670
Speaker 0: No, it's not okay.

240
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,680
Speaker 0: Yes, so so check it out.

241
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,749
Speaker 0: It's like almost the end of the world.

242
00:17:56,173 --> 00:18:04,300
Speaker 0: these people King from a giant awesome Kingdom has a castle hidden away and he runs away to that castle the citadel of Isha.

243
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,188
Speaker 1: I'll succumb during the height of the apocalypse.

244
00:18:06,469 --> 00:18:08,578
Speaker 1: exactly no army of inhuman strength.

245
00:18:08,598 --> 00:18:10,364
Speaker 1: It's scaled it's right and it's really.

246
00:18:10,745 --> 00:18:20,456
Speaker 0: it's really subtle because they put the years in sort of like these headlines cuz 2147 year of the tusks the mountains of demerara right demo.

247
00:18:20,476 --> 00:18:28,468
Speaker 0: Ah, yeah So but like at first I was like, you know, cuz it's not it's not a hue It's not an earth, you know year system.

248
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,472
Speaker 0: So I wasn't sure.

249
00:18:29,492 --> 00:18:30,515
Speaker 0: I'm like, is that the year?

250
00:18:30,535 --> 00:18:32,200
Speaker 0: does they measure it in days?

251
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:32,802
Speaker 0: What's there?

252
00:18:33,203 --> 00:18:35,270
Speaker 0: What's their system for measuring these things?

253
00:18:35,651 --> 00:18:38,240
Speaker 0: You know, I'm like, maybe it wasn't actually a thousand years later.

254
00:18:38,571 --> 00:18:40,086
Speaker 0: Oh, no It was a thousand years later.

255
00:18:40,207 --> 00:18:48,366
Speaker 1: because I think we said this when we're selling the book to you But the fact that the second chapter starts late autumn 4109 year of the tusks.

256
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:58,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, and because I was thinking oh, maybe maybe it's sort of like a Chinese thing Where it's here at the tusk The next year is like, you know year of the horn and then the year after that is year of the tail.

257
00:18:58,401 --> 00:19:02,746
Speaker 0: But I was like, you know exactly 2,000 years later it's not again and like.

258
00:19:03,027 --> 00:19:04,572
Speaker 1: it wasn't necessarily confusing.

259
00:19:04,632 --> 00:19:17,644
Speaker 1: but there was a moment of wait a minute when Mo you start to realize that mo Angus was Kellis's father Because mo Angus went out and he traveled and he you know He made nayer what he was.

260
00:19:17,664 --> 00:19:26,875
Speaker 1: and then Kellis runs into nayer and there's again that brilliant scene where nayer sees Kellis he sees mo Angus.

261
00:19:27,317 --> 00:19:33,063
Speaker 1: Yep And he's he's as confused as I am All right.

262
00:19:33,123 --> 00:19:34,328
Speaker 1: So what I then went.

263
00:19:34,368 --> 00:19:45,365
Speaker 1: but then at the same time then right along right there You see Kellis seeing nayer and realizing what right away that Mo Angus has trained him.

264
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:46,206
Speaker 1: Yep.

265
00:19:46,607 --> 00:19:52,760
Speaker 0: He knows what I am Because he's they're talking about the trackless step and such right all the trackless steps.

266
00:19:52,921 --> 00:19:54,660
Speaker 1: I think we need to talk a little bit about the track.

267
00:19:54,780 --> 00:20:10,550
Speaker 0: And the thing is is when you know Kellis is walking down his trackless step, but then he sees that all of his tracks That this mayor has been put on his tracks by mo Angus That's like ah, he'd conquered the darkness that came before he believed.

268
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:25,120
Speaker 1: but then mo Angus came before and throughout the whole first book You always see this kind of conflict Possibly the only conflict at all within Kellis Which is I am following this path that my father laid out before me.

269
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,525
Speaker 1: Did my father come before?

270
00:20:26,866 --> 00:20:30,480
Speaker 1: do I have any choice in the matter, but it's interesting because he's not questioning it.

271
00:20:30,761 --> 00:20:33,470
Speaker 1: He's not thinking do I have a choice in the matter?

272
00:20:33,751 --> 00:20:36,400
Speaker 1: He's thinking I am following this path.

273
00:20:36,881 --> 00:20:37,784
Speaker 1: Yep, it's it's.

274
00:20:37,944 --> 00:20:45,794
Speaker 1: it's very strange how he how he can note realize that he might have an option But yet he accepts that he has no options.

275
00:20:46,257 --> 00:20:49,406
Speaker 0: Yep I was gonna say something awesome.

276
00:20:49,426 --> 00:20:49,627
Speaker 0: All right.

277
00:20:49,647 --> 00:21:05,770
Speaker 0: So yeah, so the title of the book the darkness that comes before so clever So clever, I mean at the first you think oh the darkness that comes before it's probably you know Some evil guys coming up doing some evil bad dark followed by the other things.

278
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:07,175
Speaker 1: you can even think it was something straight up.

279
00:21:07,215 --> 00:21:11,038
Speaker 1: the darkness that comes before is the Apocalypse before the rebirth in all sorts of ways.

280
00:21:11,078 --> 00:21:18,300
Speaker 0: Yep But no the the theme of Kellis and the Danie and the whole deal is you know that what comes before?

281
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,099
Speaker 0: Determines what comes after and not vice versa.

282
00:21:23,202 --> 00:21:24,166
Speaker 0: Cause and effect.

283
00:21:24,186 --> 00:21:27,759
Speaker 0: you don't have effects causing causes its cause followed by effect.

284
00:21:28,343 --> 00:21:37,357
Speaker 0: You are come before the cause Control the causes are the causes know what the causes are then the effects.

285
00:21:37,537 --> 00:21:46,571
Speaker 0: you own them you you know, so the darkness that comes before is a dark thing that Controls the causes.

286
00:21:46,652 --> 00:21:50,910
Speaker 0: it comes before Everyone else's causes and therefore determines the effect.

287
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:56,472
Speaker 1: and it's the darkness merely because if you can't see what came before You cannot know what will come after.

288
00:21:56,533 --> 00:21:59,745
Speaker 0: you can only guess it's not Really dark because it's evil.

289
00:21:59,765 --> 00:22:01,351
Speaker 0: It's dark because you can't see it.

290
00:22:01,391 --> 00:22:02,715
Speaker 1: You can't see it as I can.

291
00:22:02,735 --> 00:22:04,946
Speaker 0: you see you're mastered by What do you see?

292
00:22:05,127 --> 00:22:06,214
Speaker 1: What do you see?

293
00:22:06,254 --> 00:22:06,999
Speaker 0: What do you see?

294
00:22:08,992 --> 00:22:11,974
Speaker 0: But There any what do you sees in the first book?

295
00:22:12,015 --> 00:22:12,438
Speaker 0: I forget.

296
00:22:12,478 --> 00:22:16,790
Speaker 1: Yes but anyway Think about this for a minute before we even go any further.

297
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:29,080
Speaker 1: because what makes these books so appealing is they bring up Very difficult very complex issues and Like most of my favorite literature they give you get no answers you get no.

298
00:22:29,521 --> 00:22:31,949
Speaker 1: Oh, well, the answer is this or this is the moral.

299
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:35,220
Speaker 1: the moral is well, that's what happened.

300
00:22:35,682 --> 00:22:43,540
Speaker 0: Not only do you not get much answers on you know, the philosophical sense But you don't get a great deal of satisfaction in the literal sense either.

301
00:22:43,741 --> 00:22:45,520
Speaker 0: I mean set you up with all this shit.

302
00:22:45,661 --> 00:22:50,060
Speaker 0: You know a commune can cast wicked crazy spells of death dealing.

303
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,012
Speaker 0: Hey, you know, there's like, you know this consult.

304
00:22:53,053 --> 00:22:56,740
Speaker 0: that's kind of evil and possibly scary Like look at a came in right?

305
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,583
Speaker 1: You don't even know that.

306
00:22:58,604 --> 00:23:15,860
Speaker 1: the only indication you have that he is as powerful as he might really be is That there's a few scenes where someone puts forth some indignity upon him and He just thinks to himself that he could destroy this entire place and walk through the ashes of what remained.

307
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,382
Speaker 1: It's kind of.

308
00:23:16,442 --> 00:23:19,695
Speaker 0: it's kind of weird because at first in the early part of the book, right?

309
00:23:19,715 --> 00:23:29,799
Speaker 0: He's in that town and He's sort of he's spying around right in the in the town where the Scarlet Spires sort of own Ah with with what's his name that spy who gets?

310
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,666
Speaker 0: Shanked right gets poned right?

311
00:23:32,947 --> 00:23:42,640
Speaker 0: So at that point I sort of felt like a Was sort of like a weaker, you know mage of sorts, you know that he didn't seem like he was such a powerful guy.

312
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,248
Speaker 0: It seemed like he was sort of spying staying hidden.

313
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:49,000
Speaker 0: He was scared of the Scarlet Spires coming down on him, you know.

314
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:58,020
Speaker 0: So I didn't really understand, you know, just what his power was You know any the nightmare thing sort of made him feel kind of weak like, you know, he has this big weakness.

315
00:23:58,741 --> 00:24:02,476
Speaker 0: But you know as they're like, you know, you know, the gnosis is the serious business.

316
00:24:02,838 --> 00:24:14,499
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh So it is Okay but seriously think about the idea of causality and that's what these books are in many ways about.

317
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:23,833
Speaker 1: if Everything is a product of the things that came before it then is there any possibility of free will or options?

318
00:24:24,276 --> 00:24:33,837
Speaker 1: because I mean If one thing begets another thing and another thing begets another thing and you know I hit a ball and the ball rolls down hits another ball and the ball moved because I hit it.

319
00:24:34,078 --> 00:24:42,078
Speaker 1: and I hit it because electrical impulses in my brain and that brain exists because of millions of years of evolution and all the way back is There free will and can there be free will?

320
00:24:43,302 --> 00:24:45,880
Speaker 1: Mmm, and this is a book that addresses that straight up.

321
00:24:46,701 --> 00:24:50,400
Speaker 0: Yep, and the thing is is whether there is free will or not, right?

322
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,520
Speaker 0: Some people are able to see what's going on and other people can't see what's going on.

323
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,103
Speaker 0: Well, they can.

324
00:24:57,143 --> 00:25:01,265
Speaker 0: perhaps the people that can see, you know Perhaps they can actually.

325
00:25:01,386 --> 00:25:09,559
Speaker 0: maybe they have free will and others do not and perhaps they control the wills of others or Maybe just appears that way because they can see what's going on.

326
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,785
Speaker 1: Well that definitely there is.

327
00:25:11,106 --> 00:25:24,569
Speaker 1: the one thing I really wish we could talk about more is the Dunyane Themselves because it isn't until the second book where we learn in somewhat frightening detail Exactly how the Dunyane came to be the way they are.

328
00:25:24,629 --> 00:25:27,076
Speaker 1: and very fries pretty frightening neuro puncture.

329
00:25:27,097 --> 00:25:28,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's pretty scary.

330
00:25:29,197 --> 00:25:34,060
Speaker 0: I mean This is I think I think that the training with the faces was even scarier.

331
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:40,143
Speaker 1: Yes, but this is the kind of thing where a typical fantasy book would just kind of gloss over that or just Oh wizard Did it.

332
00:25:40,566 --> 00:25:47,460
Speaker 1: but no in here it is explained Scientifically to a degree that is frightening because it's so plausible.

333
00:25:48,182 --> 00:25:49,686
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's it's pretty plausible.

334
00:25:49,706 --> 00:25:50,348
Speaker 1: It's not super plausible.

335
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:59,030
Speaker 1: It's as plausible as Hannibal Lecter is not not not the Dunyane themselves But the experimentation and how they learn that.

336
00:25:59,492 --> 00:26:01,380
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that is plausible.

337
00:26:01,701 --> 00:26:06,599
Speaker 1: I guess it is modern science and especially as time goes on could probably do things like that.

338
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,520
Speaker 0: Probably, you know, I wouldn't that might not be might not be able to have the same effect.

339
00:26:10,921 --> 00:26:12,587
Speaker 0: But you know, it could still be there.

340
00:26:12,808 --> 00:26:15,338
Speaker 1: but at the same time what if we could prove the inner?

341
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:22,339
Speaker 1: What causes the interactions of the brain to be the way they are or what the seat of seemingly freewill consciousness is?

342
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,988
Speaker 0: That's the thing that always that they keeps tearing me is that you know People, you know callous, right?

343
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:31,884
Speaker 0: He can see what's going on and most of what he does Right when he's.

344
00:26:32,226 --> 00:26:37,063
Speaker 0: but it looks like he's controlling other people and you know, sort of owning them Really?

345
00:26:37,163 --> 00:26:45,720
Speaker 0: All he's doing is just telling them what he sees He's like, you know, I see that, you know, these are all these causes and therefore this effect is gonna happen.

346
00:26:45,781 --> 00:26:47,939
Speaker 0: So he just tells people the situation that they're in.

347
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,642
Speaker 0: Realize they're in.

348
00:26:49,783 --> 00:26:58,113
Speaker 1: he only does that against very weak-minded people or like like in the beginning that trapper or people that he's already Weakened and he needs to finish do the critical.

349
00:26:58,315 --> 00:26:59,842
Speaker 0: Oh, well, yeah but I mean he'd eat.

350
00:26:59,882 --> 00:27:00,484
Speaker 1: most of the time.

351
00:27:00,524 --> 00:27:08,370
Speaker 1: the way he tricks people is simply by appearing to them by seeing what they see and Appearing to be exactly what they want the most.

352
00:27:08,731 --> 00:27:10,960
Speaker 0: Yeah that too or what a lot of time.

353
00:27:11,082 --> 00:27:18,120
Speaker 0: He just you know Is that he just points out to people what they really are thinking that they won't admit to themselves that they're thinking.

354
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,913
Speaker 1: But no, he doesn't do that that often.

355
00:27:20,953 --> 00:27:22,038
Speaker 0: He does it kind of often.

356
00:27:22,821 --> 00:27:35,424
Speaker 1: Not really not as often as you think he does it but most of the scenes where he does that and it tells someone You know the truth that they refuse to admit to themselves or the truth that they desperately wanted someone else to confirm Those are his killing blows.

357
00:27:35,464 --> 00:27:35,866
Speaker 1: Those aren't?

358
00:27:36,106 --> 00:27:43,739
Speaker 1: he builds up to that by intubating himself by by answering the question What do you see to himself and then doing exactly what he needs to do?

359
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:51,508
Speaker 1: Because by seeing Kellis through all the other characters perspectives, I would like several times I forgot what he was.

360
00:27:51,528 --> 00:27:58,655
Speaker 1: I was completely fooled by him Like I'd be reading from a cameos perspective resume as I was also fooled many times as well.

361
00:27:58,696 --> 00:28:01,186
Speaker 1: I'd be like, ah Kellis Yeah, but wait a minute.

362
00:28:01,327 --> 00:28:01,849
Speaker 1: It's Kellis.

363
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,694
Speaker 1: God damn it.

364
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:11,152
Speaker 1: Haha he got you and but the thing is I what I love so much is that that happens to nayer and His reaction is game theory.

365
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:12,720
Speaker 0: Perfect is exact.

366
00:28:13,322 --> 00:28:31,429
Speaker 0: But I would you know, despite I wouldn't act like nayer 100% Obviously, you know with the the violence and the the Breaking of horses, but I'm there score earth or whatever Horses, I would not be doing that action But I would definitely be treating.

367
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:33,657
Speaker 0: I could see myself treating Kellis the same way.

368
00:28:33,677 --> 00:28:36,347
Speaker 0: basically I'm why don't you believe anything?

369
00:28:36,407 --> 00:28:40,561
Speaker 0: I say I'm always right because you know, he tells him what he sees and what he sees is Right.

370
00:28:40,622 --> 00:28:48,711
Speaker 0: He's like because if I don't believe anything you say that even if you're right It'll be impossible for you to deceive me and that's the you know game theory.

371
00:28:48,731 --> 00:28:59,836
Speaker 1: if you can't make an informed decision or a decision Is arbitrary then your only logical course of action is to make entirely random Decisions so that no one can second-guess you.

372
00:28:59,856 --> 00:29:06,960
Speaker 1: Yep And as a result nayer starts trending more and more toward insanity and the brilliant thing.

373
00:29:07,482 --> 00:29:11,460
Speaker 0: And I think this is hinted at because he just doesn't want Kellis to to own him.

374
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,428
Speaker 0: You know Kellis sees how it's gonna play out.

375
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:16,160
Speaker 0: nayer says I can't let it play out that way.

376
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,782
Speaker 0: I don't want it to be right this One.

377
00:29:19,103 --> 00:29:22,713
Speaker 1: he doesn't care about the holy war or any of these people there.

378
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:23,094
Speaker 1: Yep.

379
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:25,180
Speaker 0: Well, he cares about himself.

380
00:29:26,886 --> 00:29:28,111
Speaker 1: He cares about one thing.

381
00:29:28,352 --> 00:29:36,260
Speaker 0: is that spoiled in the first book If we say what it is that he wants to murder Mo Angus, is that in the first book?

382
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,726
Speaker 0: I think it is in the first book.

383
00:29:37,826 --> 00:29:39,936
Speaker 1: Yes, that is definitely in the first book.

384
00:29:40,057 --> 00:29:40,760
Speaker 0: Okay, definitely is.

385
00:29:41,541 --> 00:29:52,191
Speaker 1: Despite his dislike of Kellis He doesn't care about these people because the skill then D are one of my kind of like how the orcs are Luke Crane's favorite race in burning wheel.

386
00:29:52,574 --> 00:29:59,600
Speaker 1: I love how Intricate and I guess it the way the non men would describe it beautiful.

387
00:30:00,022 --> 00:30:01,146
Speaker 1: Well, this is Andy are.

388
00:30:01,187 --> 00:30:03,055
Speaker 0: this is why the prologue is so important.

389
00:30:03,075 --> 00:30:04,300
Speaker 0: in the prologue, right?

390
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,260
Speaker 0: He treats that woodsman like shit, basically, right?

391
00:30:07,461 --> 00:30:11,720
Speaker 0: He just bowls him over and then it gets owned by the non man, right?

392
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,390
Speaker 0: Does the non man own him before or after the woodsman?

393
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:15,213
Speaker 0: It doesn't really matter.

394
00:30:15,394 --> 00:30:16,299
Speaker 1: It's after the woodsman.

395
00:30:16,419 --> 00:30:16,620
Speaker 0: Okay?

396
00:30:18,061 --> 00:30:20,349
Speaker 0: He's treating you and then you see him.

397
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:29,776
Speaker 0: go through all these other people, you know, the main characters Akame in there as minute everybody right and he's treating them like the woodsman.

398
00:30:29,877 --> 00:30:31,120
Speaker 0: It's just taking a lot longer.

399
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,474
Speaker 0: He's just like ah, it's not job And you saw the woodsman before.

400
00:30:35,856 --> 00:30:42,900
Speaker 0: but then You think of the non man and you're like is one of these people gonna get him like the non man got him?

401
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,615
Speaker 0: Maybe Nair is gonna be like the non man not just Nair.

402
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:46,500
Speaker 1: What about confess?

403
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,167
Speaker 1: Yeah Because confess is also it.

404
00:30:49,187 --> 00:30:57,583
Speaker 1: well all the characters are fascinating because they're they're three-dimensional to the to a ludicrous extents and Conf.

405
00:30:57,623 --> 00:30:58,607
Speaker 1: I love the scene.

406
00:30:58,667 --> 00:31:01,660
Speaker 1: confess is a product of some sort of defect of birth.

407
00:31:02,421 --> 00:31:04,013
Speaker 1: Yeah, that might be from the second book.

408
00:31:04,074 --> 00:31:07,450
Speaker 1: I don't remember off-hand I don't really remember anything but there that I don't know.

409
00:31:07,711 --> 00:31:07,912
Speaker 1: I don't.

410
00:31:07,972 --> 00:31:09,880
Speaker 1: I couldn't even say who my favorite character is.

411
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,700
Speaker 1: I mean I identify the most with the K mean because he's the one person who is earnest and forthright.

412
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:16,739
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't identify.

413
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:22,693
Speaker 0: Identify with you know, as I've said like probably for the third time Nayers, you know skepticism such.

414
00:31:22,854 --> 00:31:30,202
Speaker 0: I identify with a communes You know, but when he's not even he's not going crazy and having nightmares, you know He's sort of.

415
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:34,439
Speaker 0: he's actually sort of level-headed and sort of you know, cool with it.

416
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:40,680
Speaker 1: But is not Nair a product of what moe Angus did to him coupled with his upbringing?

417
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,205
Speaker 0: yeah, pretty much.

418
00:31:42,265 --> 00:31:50,493
Speaker 1: if the skill then D culture came before then the Fact that Nair is does the things he does can almost be excused by the fact that.

419
00:31:50,714 --> 00:31:51,798
Speaker 1: did he have any choice?

420
00:31:52,239 --> 00:31:57,417
Speaker 1: Yep Well, I mean, but then again moe Angus showed him that he had a choice and that's the fact.

421
00:31:57,497 --> 00:31:58,320
Speaker 0: it is a commune.

422
00:31:58,421 --> 00:32:00,440
Speaker 0: Just uh, you know the what the night.

423
00:32:01,581 --> 00:32:01,802
Speaker 1: That's.

424
00:32:01,822 --> 00:32:25,078
Speaker 1: the fascinating thing about Nayer is that he didn't realize that he had a choice and all moe Angus did was show him that the step is trackless that he could that he had a choice that He did not have to be what he was and as a result, I mean before that he was not a good skill Vandy He was a mediocre skill Vandy at best and his father didn't seem to have a lot of respect for him.

425
00:32:26,322 --> 00:32:47,509
Speaker 1: After moe Angus showed him what you know that the truck step was trackless that he had options he went with those options and then he saw the result of that and he was so overcome with shame and Fear and all these emotions that he kind of his only possible Reaction was to be the best skill Vandy he could be.

426
00:32:48,071 --> 00:32:51,800
Speaker 1: and he does these things to overcome his internal shame fear and doubt.

427
00:32:52,303 --> 00:33:02,948
Speaker 1: So it's like he's smart enough to not be a skill Vandy But he's trapped by what the skill Vandy are and the promise of if you do these things You'll be respected by these people.

428
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,180
Speaker 1: I want to be respected by these people again.

429
00:33:05,782 --> 00:33:14,012
Speaker 1: I must do these things and as a result, he does them he becomes skill Vandy more So than any other skill Vandy ever was or is I think in the first book.

430
00:33:14,052 --> 00:33:19,200
Speaker 0: that is the trackless step message is the one Translate translates most into the real world.

431
00:33:19,561 --> 00:33:25,220
Speaker 0: You know the modern real world today because I see people all over the place, right?

432
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:31,432
Speaker 0: you have problems or just want things and There are many other many things they can do.

433
00:33:31,493 --> 00:33:37,675
Speaker 0: the step is trackless yet They block out certain options for you know, not any real reason.

434
00:33:37,755 --> 00:33:39,280
Speaker 0: it is for psychological reasons.

435
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,550
Speaker 0: They they limit themselves to.

436
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:42,635
Speaker 0: you know, I can't.

437
00:33:42,695 --> 00:33:43,800
Speaker 0: that's not something I can do.

438
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:53,759
Speaker 0: That's not something I can do and usually the things that they just refuse to do for who knows why are probably the best ways for them to get what they want and have things go nicely.

439
00:33:53,779 --> 00:34:14,188
Speaker 0: and You know you see Nayer is in that same sort of situation that you know at when he's before Moangis comes that a lot of people I meet in everyday life are in where you know, they want certain things But they don't realize that there are other ways they could be going about it and just something about their minds Sort of like, you know just cancels out those options.

440
00:34:14,248 --> 00:34:20,619
Speaker 0: then Moangis says, you know, you can do these options and suddenly he's like, oh Shit, I could do these other things.

441
00:34:20,721 --> 00:34:21,723
Speaker 1: All right Let's go off on.

442
00:34:21,743 --> 00:34:29,846
Speaker 1: let's talk about a cup because there's a lot of big scenes that I can talk about Talk about what someone we haven't talked about at all The Emperor xerius.

443
00:34:30,025 --> 00:34:34,739
Speaker 1: Okay, so xerius and all the people surrounding the Empire.

444
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:45,126
Speaker 1: It's fascinating and wonderful and I love these characters Even though I despise everything they do and everything I say is something I'm actually sort of Unclear about right?

445
00:34:45,246 --> 00:34:49,139
Speaker 0: So is it like the Empress is his mom, right?

446
00:34:50,281 --> 00:34:51,248
Speaker 0: He doesn't have a wife.

447
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:52,719
Speaker 0: There's no wife Empress.

448
00:34:53,161 --> 00:34:57,056
Speaker 0: No, there's no Emperor cuz he was sort of okay cuz it was sort of like unclear at times.

449
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:59,066
Speaker 0: cuz like, you know His mom is old.

450
00:34:59,107 --> 00:35:00,475
Speaker 0: His mom is younger.

451
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:01,180
Speaker 0: He's got the house.

452
00:35:02,104 --> 00:35:02,747
Speaker 1: Now that I think back.

453
00:35:02,808 --> 00:35:03,732
Speaker 1: I don't really remember.

454
00:35:03,772 --> 00:35:05,360
Speaker 0: He's got the hots for his mom.

455
00:35:06,706 --> 00:35:08,194
Speaker 1: That family is full of incest.

456
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:10,844
Speaker 0: it is full of incest But it's totally I'm.

457
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:17,180
Speaker 0: it's sort of like the way that the characters interact throughout in the different like scenes throughout the books.

458
00:35:17,781 --> 00:35:19,606
Speaker 0: I can't really exactly tell.

459
00:35:19,626 --> 00:35:24,700
Speaker 0: the relationship seems to sort of change almost randomly which I guess fits because those people are insane.

460
00:35:24,867 --> 00:35:28,810
Speaker 1: Yes They are But they're a product of lots of inbreeding and not the good kind.

461
00:35:28,831 --> 00:35:31,620
Speaker 0: lots of inbreeding and lots of power results in no good.

462
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:35,840
Speaker 1: But at the same time like the see I hinted at this when we were selling this book.

463
00:35:36,101 --> 00:35:40,354
Speaker 1: Confess came out of that somehow, but he at the same time confesses fucked up.

464
00:35:40,454 --> 00:35:42,320
Speaker 0: He is but he's not as fucked up as serious.

465
00:35:43,601 --> 00:35:43,782
Speaker 0: He's.

466
00:35:43,902 --> 00:35:45,912
Speaker 0: at least he's smarter than serious.

467
00:35:46,153 --> 00:35:47,620
Speaker 1: No, no, he's not.

468
00:35:48,001 --> 00:35:49,085
Speaker 1: That's the problem.

469
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:49,226
Speaker 1: in

470
00:35:49,246 --> 00:35:50,510
Speaker 0: some ways he is because

471
00:35:50,791 --> 00:36:10,390
Speaker 1: the thing that's so wonderful about the scene I hinted at would when confess returns victorious from the war with the skill Vendi and He is standing before his uncle the Emperor of the Empire of the Nansarian and he's you see in his head and he's thinking I Should kill my uncle right now.

472
00:36:10,832 --> 00:36:12,079
Speaker 1: My troops are all lined up.

473
00:36:12,441 --> 00:36:18,950
Speaker 1: They'll support me and the whole time he's thinking so should I stab him in the neck and Or and then just rush forward?

474
00:36:19,172 --> 00:36:20,300
Speaker 1: should I stab him in the gut?

475
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,246
Speaker 1: Well, how exactly should I go about this?

476
00:36:22,767 --> 00:36:29,231
Speaker 1: and you see and then the Emperor's perspective and he's doing all these things and you see that scales Knows what's going on.

477
00:36:29,372 --> 00:36:29,856
Speaker 1: scale see?

478
00:36:31,602 --> 00:36:32,385
Speaker 1: I say scales.

479
00:36:32,606 --> 00:36:33,590
Speaker 0: Anyway, what it doesn't matter.

480
00:36:33,611 --> 00:36:34,534
Speaker 1: That sounds right in my head.

481
00:36:34,554 --> 00:36:35,498
Speaker 1: I never looked up how it's like.

482
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:45,869
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think like scales better what it doesn't matter they that there's so many proper nouns in this book and only some of them have pronunciation guides and On a sword and bore is one of the best words.

483
00:36:45,889 --> 00:36:48,600
Speaker 0: I think it's on a suit in board on a certain bore.

484
00:36:48,741 --> 00:36:50,085
Speaker 0: I think it's on a certain bore.

485
00:36:50,286 --> 00:36:52,354
Speaker 1: on a certain bore sounds on a stupid.

486
00:36:52,615 --> 00:36:55,024
Speaker 0: I think it sounds more Kingly.

487
00:36:55,045 --> 00:36:58,240
Speaker 1: I think on a certain bore sounds more kingly now.

488
00:36:58,802 --> 00:37:01,152
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway that I like that word though.

489
00:37:01,614 --> 00:37:03,180
Speaker 1: I do like I love these books.

490
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:07,940
Speaker 0: That's another thing is that he's really got the kiki booboo going on with his proper nouns.

491
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,360
Speaker 0: You know, if you know what I'm saying, he's totally got the synesthesia going on.

492
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,493
Speaker 0: I'm like on a certain bore is is the ancient king right?

493
00:37:14,513 --> 00:37:16,340
Speaker 0: and that sounds like the name of an ancient king.

494
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:30,920
Speaker 0: it really gives you an ancient king feeling, you know, and and Nayer Erskyothas is a very Barbarian sounding kind of name and it gives you the synesthesia of sort of, you know, grrr and the kah of barbarianism.

495
00:37:31,161 --> 00:37:38,923
Speaker 0: So it's like even though he seems to have chosen like, you know a base almost seemingly random proper nouns Completely made up.

496
00:37:39,324 --> 00:37:46,989
Speaker 0: They really have a strong, you know sounding even though they're not based in Latin roots or anything Consistent within the cultures.

497
00:37:47,049 --> 00:37:49,960
Speaker 1: that yeah brought them out within the books themselves.

498
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:50,723
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's another thing.

499
00:37:50,743 --> 00:37:57,957
Speaker 0: like all the Nansurium proper nouns are sort of you know Similar like you've got zinnimis and xerius and khanfass.

500
00:37:57,997 --> 00:38:10,085
Speaker 1: those, you know Those all those words sort of feel like they're from the same culture the same language especially because you know that a lot of these languages were related to each other and the nations all came out of a very natural history.

501
00:38:10,185 --> 00:38:17,182
Speaker 0: yet in the north this place is named like, you know, Ishuall and Golgotharoth.

502
00:38:17,202 --> 00:38:17,443
Speaker 1: Golgotharoth.

503
00:38:17,604 --> 00:38:19,130
Speaker 1: I'll have to get to that in a minute.

504
00:38:19,271 --> 00:38:21,580
Speaker 0: I don't know how much Golgotharoth is in the first book.

505
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,351
Speaker 1: Not enough.

506
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:26,120
Speaker 1: Not enough Never you mind the arc of the skies.

507
00:38:27,701 --> 00:38:29,367
Speaker 0: There is not enough Golgotharoth.

508
00:38:29,568 --> 00:38:30,451
Speaker 0: This might be a spoiler.

509
00:38:30,472 --> 00:38:33,703
Speaker 0: There is not enough Golgotharoth in the three books They taught you with that shit.

510
00:38:33,723 --> 00:38:35,288
Speaker 1: Well I'll say this the first book.

511
00:38:35,408 --> 00:38:41,730
Speaker 1: I remember I started reading it and it hints at the Apocalypse is going to happen again.

512
00:38:42,132 --> 00:38:43,198
Speaker 1: All right, I'm fine with that.

513
00:38:43,258 --> 00:38:45,225
Speaker 1: I'm reading Oh a holy war starting.

514
00:38:45,526 --> 00:38:47,110
Speaker 1: that's gonna be on the way to the apocalypse.

515
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:50,340
Speaker 1: And then I remember Alex says just keep reading.

516
00:38:50,945 --> 00:38:52,719
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna tell you where the first book ends.

517
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,275
Speaker 1: You won't be happy but you know, the first book ends with all right.

518
00:38:57,596 --> 00:39:01,246
Speaker 1: The holy war is About to begin.

519
00:39:01,808 --> 00:39:06,605
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean think about halfway through the book They show you.

520
00:39:06,786 --> 00:39:08,332
Speaker 0: they show that the reader at least.

521
00:39:08,653 --> 00:39:10,560
Speaker 0: yes, the consult is real.

522
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:11,988
Speaker 0: Here's the crow demon.

523
00:39:12,832 --> 00:39:17,430
Speaker 0: and then at the end of the book It's like Akavian knows the consult is real.

524
00:39:17,751 --> 00:39:21,905
Speaker 0: and then they end the book and you're like, ah fuck you Fuck you.

525
00:39:22,106 --> 00:39:26,583
Speaker 1: It's like it's like when you're climbing breakneck Ridge where you see the peak, you know, like, all right I'm almost there.

526
00:39:26,905 --> 00:39:28,312
Speaker 0: Because our listeners know breakneck Ridge.

527
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:29,919
Speaker 1: Yes, but I'm going to explain it.

528
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:35,360
Speaker 1: So you get to the peak but then you look up and there was another peak set back that you couldn't see from the ground.

529
00:39:35,481 --> 00:39:36,064
Speaker 1: And there it is.

530
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:40,879
Speaker 1: I'll climb that peak and when you climb that peak There are two more peaks.

531
00:39:44,084 --> 00:39:45,048
Speaker 0: But yeah, they totally.

532
00:39:45,068 --> 00:39:47,497
Speaker 0: it's like the consult is obvious it's.

533
00:39:47,597 --> 00:39:47,737
Speaker 0: it's.

534
00:39:47,898 --> 00:39:49,805
Speaker 0: they're basically Obviously bad.

535
00:39:49,966 --> 00:39:51,932
Speaker 0: that the obvious bad evil guy.

536
00:39:51,953 --> 00:39:57,936
Speaker 1: but at the same time what they are What they want and what they are compared to what?

537
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,986
Speaker 1: The no god is.

538
00:40:01,006 --> 00:40:04,780
Speaker 1: and what you mean mug for our log father.

539
00:40:04,941 --> 00:40:05,927
Speaker 0: Talk about an evil name.

540
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:08,000
Speaker 0: Look at that synesthesia going on at the same time.

541
00:40:08,544 --> 00:40:10,460
Speaker 1: I don't I don't know what to think about the no god.

542
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,646
Speaker 1: But again, that's something we can't.

543
00:40:11,947 --> 00:40:13,455
Speaker 0: I know what to think about the no god.

544
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:14,420
Speaker 0: At least I think I do.

545
00:40:14,721 --> 00:40:16,426
Speaker 1: I think I know what I saw.

546
00:40:16,446 --> 00:40:18,532
Speaker 0: I think I know what I saw too.

547
00:40:18,592 --> 00:40:21,240
Speaker 0: Perhaps some like sarcophagus the tornado around it.

548
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:22,889
Speaker 1: so here's the problem the.

549
00:40:23,111 --> 00:40:30,140
Speaker 1: I guess the a lot of the Academic points that I would really like to discuss about these books require that you have read all three books.

550
00:40:30,341 --> 00:40:31,746
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not going to say.

551
00:40:31,867 --> 00:40:37,967
Speaker 1: Oh, well, we could just talk about it spoilers whatever because it's not one Comprehension impossible without having read.

552
00:40:37,987 --> 00:40:42,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, indeed and beyond that the this is like cowboy bebop.

553
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:45,292
Speaker 1: I could not spoil some of the things that happened.

554
00:40:45,352 --> 00:40:47,100
Speaker 1: I would not feel right in doing so.

555
00:40:47,341 --> 00:40:50,658
Speaker 1: No, I wouldn't feel right because I assume you've read the first book.

556
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,973
Speaker 1: That's scene that I was talking about where confesses.

557
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:56,760
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna murder the at my uncle.

558
00:40:57,144 --> 00:41:01,238
Speaker 1: I'm going to become Emperor and how Elegantly.

559
00:41:02,022 --> 00:41:02,744
Speaker 1: What the I mean?

560
00:41:02,884 --> 00:41:08,257
Speaker 1: up until this point I'd pictured serious and looking a lot like Aladdin the king in Aladdin.

561
00:41:08,277 --> 00:41:10,547
Speaker 0: I Didn't picture serious like.

562
00:41:10,587 --> 00:41:11,995
Speaker 1: I just picture him looking that way.

563
00:41:12,015 --> 00:41:14,407
Speaker 1: I don't know why this Bumbling crazy.

564
00:41:14,548 --> 00:41:19,648
Speaker 0: I think I pictured him more like Xerxes from Civ 2 But anyway, I don't know why.

565
00:41:19,668 --> 00:41:20,512
Speaker 0: maybe it's the exes.

566
00:41:20,552 --> 00:41:22,300
Speaker 1: the exes doesn't look anything like Xerxes.

567
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:32,238
Speaker 0: Yeah I picture you know I picture con fast as like one of those Roman guys with sort of like the close curly fro and like you sort of like at the white and gold going on.

568
00:41:32,278 --> 00:41:35,367
Speaker 1: and he's Is a man who exemplify.

569
00:41:35,407 --> 00:41:40,620
Speaker 1: if you had it if he was a burning wheel character his trait would be able to sneer.

570
00:41:41,021 --> 00:41:47,836
Speaker 0: Yeah, the other thing is that if you actually read the descriptions of these characters, like I sort of always messed up reading them I do that in a lot of books.

571
00:41:47,957 --> 00:41:51,706
Speaker 0: actually It's sort of my fault is I don't the Descriptions of what characters look like.

572
00:41:52,006 --> 00:41:55,015
Speaker 0: I sort of come up with what the characters look like based on like.

573
00:41:55,035 --> 00:42:02,332
Speaker 0: I sort of apply a look to their attitudes Rather than actually reading the descriptions of what they look like at the same time.

574
00:42:02,352 --> 00:42:04,780
Speaker 1: They're looks exactly like his attitude.

575
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,744
Speaker 0: Well, that's true.

576
00:42:05,864 --> 00:42:09,720
Speaker 0: But I don't think anyone's there's not gonna be too much dispute about what nair looks like.

577
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,429
Speaker 0: But it's like, you know conference is a beard.

578
00:42:11,469 --> 00:42:12,776
Speaker 0: I didn't realize that till the third book.

579
00:42:12,917 --> 00:42:18,405
Speaker 0: Good God Yeah, it's like, you know, cuz I just sort of pictured him is like, you know in the way I sort of thought he acted.

580
00:42:18,826 --> 00:42:20,352
Speaker 1: actually that's an important point.

581
00:42:20,754 --> 00:42:22,340
Speaker 0: I keep me giving off and crazy tangent.

582
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,324
Speaker 0: That's how this book is.

583
00:42:23,846 --> 00:42:49,562
Speaker 1: but when we were talking about how you see things from different people's perspectives and all that the reason that these books are so descriptive and if they don't fall into that trap of Describing exactly the intricate design of the language on the sword than the blah blah blah blah that no one cares about except fantasy book like super fans is that the descriptions are often very vague very subjective very Transient.

584
00:42:49,743 --> 00:42:55,258
Speaker 1: they jump around a lot and the reason for this is because again, we see everything through other characters heads.

585
00:42:55,699 --> 00:43:09,820
Speaker 1: So You when you experience a scene Despite the fact that you get less objective information than you might expect In fact, like when you describe a battle or a fight in these books So you're reading about a scene where two characters meet or when two characters sitting around a fire.

586
00:43:10,582 --> 00:43:16,899
Speaker 1: There is very little actual descriptive text saying what colors things are what things look like where people are.

587
00:43:18,084 --> 00:43:21,328
Speaker 1: All the descriptive text is The impressions.

588
00:43:21,872 --> 00:43:22,959
Speaker 1: it's as though you were there.

589
00:43:23,261 --> 00:43:35,253
Speaker 1: You are the character that currently has the point of view and you were experiencing things the way a real person experiences things this kind of Train of thought stream of consciousness like you don't.

590
00:43:35,594 --> 00:43:37,160
Speaker 1: the description when you meet someone is not.

591
00:43:37,621 --> 00:43:39,427
Speaker 1: He was this tall and he had a beard.

592
00:43:39,728 --> 00:43:41,334
Speaker 1: if you walk into a room.

593
00:43:41,374 --> 00:43:43,060
Speaker 1: He was a man who scared me.

594
00:43:43,321 --> 00:44:00,012
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you walk into a room and you say hi to someone you don't suddenly You know measure them weigh them, you know, you know calculate like how how hairy they are Like it colors their eyes Realistic and that you see what a real person would see.

595
00:44:00,033 --> 00:44:02,260
Speaker 1: a lot like a lot of times a character.

596
00:44:02,701 --> 00:44:09,707
Speaker 1: You'll miss a whole bunch of what's going on because the character in whose head you were was not paying attention.

597
00:44:10,048 --> 00:44:15,212
Speaker 1: and you weren't paying attention because you were following them and they were Thinking about something or like.

598
00:44:15,232 --> 00:44:16,880
Speaker 1: they see something and they fixate on it.

599
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,736
Speaker 1: Then they miss what the person just said or they miss something.

600
00:44:19,777 --> 00:44:24,580
Speaker 0: that happened Actually a lot in the first book a lot more than in the second and third books.

601
00:44:24,921 --> 00:44:30,600
Speaker 0: I found myself reading going back and reading again and finding I didn't actually miss anything.

602
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,530
Speaker 0: It just wasn't told to me and that's that alone.

603
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:34,413
Speaker 1: If nothing else.

604
00:44:34,835 --> 00:44:36,440
Speaker 1: that is the brilliance of this writing.

605
00:44:36,521 --> 00:44:39,808
Speaker 1: That is what makes our Scott backer I a writer among writers.

606
00:44:39,848 --> 00:44:45,349
Speaker 1: for me is that he can write a book that is so Exquisitely immersive and so wonderfully.

607
00:44:45,389 --> 00:44:48,860
Speaker 1: you feel as though you see everything like it's again.

608
00:44:48,920 --> 00:45:01,636
Speaker 1: it's an example from the second book, but there's a gigantic battle in the course of the Holy War and The battle is described and you feel as though you are standing right there Next to the general in charge of the entire army watching

609
00:45:01,676 --> 00:45:02,440
Speaker 0: it from on top of him.

610
00:45:02,521 --> 00:45:04,776
Speaker 1: You feel as though you see every detail.

611
00:45:04,796 --> 00:45:13,525
Speaker 1: you're there You were actually there and yet if you actually read it like paragraph by paragraph or backwards Almost nothing is described.

612
00:45:13,566 --> 00:45:16,936
Speaker 1: It's all flashes and impressions and it's.

613
00:45:17,518 --> 00:45:18,160
Speaker 1: it's perfect.

614
00:45:18,563 --> 00:45:20,074
Speaker 1: It's hard to describe it with it.

615
00:45:20,094 --> 00:45:20,820
Speaker 1: Just you have to read it.

616
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:23,676
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't think I would even do it justice by reading an excerpt.

617
00:45:24,078 --> 00:45:26,422
Speaker 0: No No reading any Excerpt.

618
00:45:26,823 --> 00:45:32,060
Speaker 0: the only things you can really read from this book to impress people like the quotes the beginning the chapters which are all awesome.

619
00:45:32,383 --> 00:45:34,340
Speaker 1: That is another brilliant part of these books.

620
00:45:34,541 --> 00:45:39,153
Speaker 0: Well, how a lot of books do the shtick of putting quotes at the beginning of the chapter.

621
00:45:39,214 --> 00:45:41,903
Speaker 0: some books use quotes from other real Books.

622
00:45:42,387 --> 00:45:48,153
Speaker 0: some books use, you know Quotes that are sort of relevant to the chapter at hand and this does that somewhat.

623
00:45:48,614 --> 00:45:58,771
Speaker 0: but they you this book does quotes and most of them are either from Fictional books of the past of the world.

624
00:45:58,791 --> 00:46:01,199
Speaker 0: They're books that exist within the book.

625
00:46:01,721 --> 00:46:07,060
Speaker 0: So it's like, you know, there'll be a quote from the tusk which is the Bible of the prince of nothing world.

626
00:46:07,321 --> 00:46:19,379
Speaker 0: there'll be quotes from you know, some book a Commie and writes years from now, you know at so, you know, he lives because those quotes are there, you know It's not a spoiler and it's like and all of them are awesome.

627
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:23,085
Speaker 1: I mean right away Not men's rank and men.

628
00:46:23,507 --> 00:46:31,997
Speaker 1: the first forgets the third regrets and the second has all the fun an ancient Coonerick nursery rhyme, I think it's Cooney Eric, whatever.

629
00:46:32,098 --> 00:46:37,840
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter There's a symbol over one you a different symbol over the other you yeah Coonerick, whatever.

630
00:46:39,001 --> 00:46:39,422
Speaker 0: It's a good.

631
00:46:39,462 --> 00:46:43,552
Speaker 0: my favorite one was I think I forget what it was.

632
00:46:43,612 --> 00:46:44,394
Speaker 0: It was so relevant.

633
00:46:44,414 --> 00:46:45,096
Speaker 0: It was like the.

634
00:46:45,116 --> 00:46:47,563
Speaker 0: I Can't remember now.

635
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:50,618
Speaker 0: Oh, it was basically one that said faith dumb science.

636
00:46:50,659 --> 00:46:50,819
Speaker 0: good.

637
00:46:51,962 --> 00:46:52,745
Speaker 1: There are a lot of those.

638
00:46:53,147 --> 00:46:55,217
Speaker 0: there are I mean, there's an essay online.

639
00:46:55,257 --> 00:46:57,505
Speaker 0: I've talked about it I think at least mentioned it before.

640
00:46:57,525 --> 00:47:08,775
Speaker 0: he talks about, you know, the sort of a hypocrisy that goes on being a a Skeptical science reason minded person and a fantasy world with magic and God knows what.

641
00:47:08,896 --> 00:47:19,240
Speaker 0: and he is an essay that R Scott backer wrote talking about how you can sort of you know Put these two things together and these books clearly go right along with that essay.

642
00:47:19,305 --> 00:47:23,814
Speaker 0: You know You got to read the essay to sort of it help you a lot understand what's going on the books.

643
00:47:24,155 --> 00:47:30,159
Speaker 0: if it wasn't obvious already I mean, I basically read the books then saw the essay and went oh duh that makes sense.

644
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:32,503
Speaker 1: So the.

645
00:47:32,885 --> 00:47:34,150
Speaker 1: I guess we should probably wrap this up.

646
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:36,660
Speaker 1: We again we barely scratched the surface.

647
00:47:36,881 --> 00:47:38,447
Speaker 0: Oh, man, the surface not even scratch.

648
00:47:38,487 --> 00:47:40,455
Speaker 0: I mean, there are characters within time.

649
00:47:40,475 --> 00:47:41,600
Speaker 0: We didn't talk about Esma at all.

650
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:43,125
Speaker 0: We didn't talk about the crow demon.

651
00:47:43,145 --> 00:47:46,015
Speaker 0: All right, mostly a character driven things.

652
00:47:46,035 --> 00:47:47,600
Speaker 0: That's really how it has to be talked about.

653
00:47:48,041 --> 00:47:50,289
Speaker 1: I want to address at least one.

654
00:47:50,309 --> 00:47:52,256
Speaker 0: We didn't talk about the campfires.

655
00:47:52,296 --> 00:47:53,078
Speaker 0: don't come to the second.

656
00:47:53,099 --> 00:47:53,520
Speaker 0: No, they don't.

657
00:47:53,982 --> 00:47:57,939
Speaker 1: I think I want to address one actual serious literary issue because it's one.

658
00:47:57,959 --> 00:48:05,707
Speaker 1: well there's two but I'll address the first one first and see we have time for the second one because we've mostly again been talking about The show is basically been all man.

659
00:48:05,727 --> 00:48:06,450
Speaker 1: These books are awesome.

660
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:07,153
Speaker 0: How awesome are they?

661
00:48:07,354 --> 00:48:08,920
Speaker 0: So that's what people want.

662
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,439
Speaker 0: I mean, we've sort of realized that people don't need you know.

663
00:48:12,941 --> 00:48:19,028
Speaker 0: There's reviews to decide if you're gonna buy something or not Right, and then there's reviews to entertain.

664
00:48:19,088 --> 00:48:31,037
Speaker 0: people have already experienced the work and I really think that Podcasts in general are definitely seem to be leaning towards the ladder and there's actually a demand for the ladder except We didn't talk a lot about specific awesome scenes and go.

665
00:48:31,077 --> 00:48:32,465
Speaker 1: Oh my god We mostly just kind of went.

666
00:48:32,967 --> 00:48:38,697
Speaker 0: but I mean if you had read the book and you're listening to what you know If you've been listening to us, I imagine that you were probably just sitting there going.

667
00:48:38,737 --> 00:48:40,808
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Alright, I hope so.

668
00:48:40,908 --> 00:48:41,150
Speaker 1: Yeah.

669
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:46,811
Speaker 1: Well in speaking of all yeah We do have to note how the first book ends that scene in when.

670
00:48:47,112 --> 00:48:49,960
Speaker 1: basically I love that all the complex interplay where?

671
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:55,013
Speaker 1: Kellis Notices that something is wrong with scales and the fact that he's.

672
00:48:55,494 --> 00:49:01,130
Speaker 1: it's like his face is Composed and it's like you got the fingers stretched across something.

673
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:05,984
Speaker 0: the way they actually described the skin spy is actually You.

674
00:49:06,245 --> 00:49:09,040
Speaker 0: everyone totally has the same idea of how it works.

675
00:49:09,462 --> 00:49:13,460
Speaker 0: You know, it's like oh, it's just like a bunch of little fingers all crossing each other.

676
00:49:13,581 --> 00:49:16,939
Speaker 0: So it's like, you know, like a venus flytrap only with a lot more teeth.

677
00:49:18,725 --> 00:49:19,669
Speaker 0: It is the technique.

678
00:49:19,689 --> 00:49:20,893
Speaker 0: the word technique used in the first.

679
00:49:20,933 --> 00:49:22,117
Speaker 1: no, it's used in the second bow.

680
00:49:22,137 --> 00:49:23,120
Speaker 0: so forget the word technique.

681
00:49:23,282 --> 00:49:24,373
Speaker 1: Yes, there is no check.

682
00:49:24,413 --> 00:49:25,080
Speaker 0: There is no technique.

683
00:49:26,144 --> 00:49:27,174
Speaker 0: We made up the technique.

684
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:27,659
Speaker 0: ignore it.

685
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:29,364
Speaker 0: It's not like you.

686
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:30,772
Speaker 0: learn any shit about the technique.

687
00:49:30,852 --> 00:49:34,485
Speaker 0: Anyway fuckers Tell me about the fucking technique.

688
00:49:34,546 --> 00:49:36,432
Speaker 0: I want to know but that's it.

689
00:49:36,613 --> 00:49:47,324
Speaker 1: The way the first book ends is not only brilliant, I think and I really like what happened and the way but soul Crushingly depressing.

690
00:49:47,765 --> 00:49:48,247
Speaker 0: Oh god.

691
00:49:48,508 --> 00:49:49,090
Speaker 0: I mean it's.

692
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:52,160
Speaker 0: they hit you really hard in one direction with the whole.

693
00:49:52,441 --> 00:49:54,667
Speaker 0: Yeah, skin spies consult is real.

694
00:49:54,988 --> 00:50:03,259
Speaker 0: a commune knows what you're gonna do what you can do and then two seconds later It's like, you know, uh, Esma shows up and he totally just doesn't even notice her.

695
00:50:03,801 --> 00:50:10,140
Speaker 1: That was one of the saddest scenes in any book I've ever read and I was like no way no way assholes.

696
00:50:10,261 --> 00:50:13,044
Speaker 1: but at the same time The the see.

697
00:50:13,064 --> 00:50:14,167
Speaker 1: this is the brilliance of these books.

698
00:50:14,467 --> 00:50:17,234
Speaker 1: the parallel scene again can't talk about it.

699
00:50:17,455 --> 00:50:29,810
Speaker 1: later book spoilers when someone's Reading a book and you get the same scene reversed Total burn just all of that.

700
00:50:30,071 --> 00:50:32,100
Speaker 1: and then the second book picks right back up.

701
00:50:32,381 --> 00:50:38,909
Speaker 0: Yeah, the second book picks up pretty much the page after the first book The same book but but I think we all are distinct.

702
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:42,599
Speaker 1: I came in was being a complete moron by not phoning home.

703
00:50:43,683 --> 00:50:45,319
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much call home a came in.

704
00:50:47,063 --> 00:50:56,866
Speaker 0: It's weird how Usually when there's what like I watch movies and other things like that, right and I'll always say, you know Why didn't they just do this?

705
00:50:56,926 --> 00:51:00,920
Speaker 0: The character was stupid and I sort of lose my suspension of disbelief, right?

706
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:01,342
Speaker 0: We're all.

707
00:51:01,827 --> 00:51:06,246
Speaker 0: I'm trying to think of an example I Tried.

708
00:51:06,266 --> 00:51:08,540
Speaker 0: see I can't think of one right now.

709
00:51:09,202 --> 00:51:10,947
Speaker 0: No here and bring up baby.

710
00:51:11,328 --> 00:51:12,392
Speaker 0: Why didn't he just leave?

711
00:51:12,933 --> 00:51:14,077
Speaker 0: why he could have just left.

712
00:51:14,157 --> 00:51:16,325
Speaker 1: see when we were watching it You didn't say why did you just leave?

713
00:51:16,346 --> 00:51:18,234
Speaker 1: you said why doesn't he punch her and then leave?

714
00:51:18,335 --> 00:51:19,360
Speaker 0: that too that did.

715
00:51:19,661 --> 00:51:25,960
Speaker 0: It's like when the character has an easy out when there's just a do this and everything will be cool.

716
00:51:26,061 --> 00:51:26,968
Speaker 0: And they don't do it.

717
00:51:27,089 --> 00:51:29,525
Speaker 0: and at least here We know why.

718
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:33,060
Speaker 0: Akami and doesn't do it because Kellis is messing with him exactly.

719
00:51:33,361 --> 00:51:36,349
Speaker 0: So there's my suspension of disbelief is not destroyed.

720
00:51:36,369 --> 00:51:36,670
Speaker 0: There's that.

721
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:40,340
Speaker 1: however, I keep saying billions where a came in resolves to do it.

722
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,509
Speaker 0: I remember reading I'm like, yeah, and then he failed.

723
00:51:42,649 --> 00:51:43,212
Speaker 1: No, he's gonna.

724
00:51:43,252 --> 00:51:44,457
Speaker 1: it's like alright, he's gonna do it.

725
00:51:44,517 --> 00:51:46,003
Speaker 1: It's about time Let's go.

726
00:51:46,023 --> 00:51:54,008
Speaker 1: and then you see like Kellis sees what he's gonna do and Kellis is oh, man And Kellis tricks him and forces him not to do it.

727
00:51:54,108 --> 00:51:57,900
Speaker 1: and I wanted to stab Kellis right then and there so badly.

728
00:51:59,221 --> 00:52:02,255
Speaker 1: It's like but I only wanted to stab him because I was in his head.

729
00:52:02,356 --> 00:52:09,287
Speaker 1: once I'm out of his head again I couldn't know and then I stopped wanting to stab him and I liked him again, but when It's like a commune.

730
00:52:09,448 --> 00:52:10,976
Speaker 0: I can believe that he doesn't do it.

731
00:52:11,137 --> 00:52:27,720
Speaker 0: So it's okay I'm not going crazy, but I'm rooting for him to do it almost the whole time and it's crazy How in these books I'll be rooting for either things I want to see happen for entertainment purposes usually involving more consult appearances, right?

732
00:52:28,241 --> 00:52:29,766
Speaker 0: I know God references.

733
00:52:29,786 --> 00:52:32,395
Speaker 1: No, I wanted you know what I wanted from the beginning.

734
00:52:32,575 --> 00:52:37,270
Speaker 1: as soon as the word gnosis appeared I wanted to know what the fuck the gnosis wasn't why it was.

735
00:52:37,952 --> 00:52:38,995
Speaker 1: I really wanted to know.

736
00:52:39,076 --> 00:52:42,106
Speaker 1: I wanted to came in to tell me Yeah, and I'll.

737
00:52:42,146 --> 00:52:45,839
Speaker 0: there also be things I'll be rooting for characters to do because it's best for them.

738
00:52:45,899 --> 00:52:54,599
Speaker 0: Of course I'm usually whoever's head I'm in right now is the person I'm rooting for them to do something Right, and I'm even if it hurts one of the other characters that I was rooting for a minute ago.

739
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:06,582
Speaker 0: But throughout the book and unlike any other book or movie or anything I've ever read or watched or listened to or anything What I root for actually Changes.

740
00:53:06,602 --> 00:53:11,718
Speaker 0: I'll root for a commune to call home and then later on I root for him not to call home.

741
00:53:11,798 --> 00:53:13,363
Speaker 0: It's crazy I can't believe.

742
00:53:13,444 --> 00:53:15,732
Speaker 0: I couldn't like I couldn't imagine myself doing that.

743
00:53:15,813 --> 00:53:16,415
Speaker 0: but I was doing.

744
00:53:16,435 --> 00:53:19,167
Speaker 0: I was like don't call home Don't go home, but I was like, wait a minute.

745
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:24,734
Speaker 0: I wanted it to call home so badly Just a few chapters ago and there's now.

746
00:53:24,775 --> 00:53:32,180
Speaker 1: I'm saying don't go home Especially later because the holy war is marching and a lot, you know, you're rooting for the holy war a lot of the time.

747
00:53:32,623 --> 00:53:36,525
Speaker 1: But then you step back and realize wait a minute The holy war is terrible.

748
00:53:36,545 --> 00:53:40,900
Speaker 1: The holy war is only going to make the apocalypse more likely.

749
00:53:41,921 --> 00:53:43,206
Speaker 1: What is kill is doing?

750
00:53:43,487 --> 00:53:43,908
Speaker 1: What is that?

751
00:53:44,009 --> 00:53:45,093
Speaker 1: What are these people doing?

752
00:53:45,354 --> 00:53:46,197
Speaker 1: It's all careless.

753
00:53:46,378 --> 00:53:54,446
Speaker 0: Oh my god Right, but I can't root against the holy war because of all I know of you know The guys down in Shema first time.

754
00:53:54,466 --> 00:53:55,148
Speaker 0: we've said she may.

755
00:53:55,168 --> 00:53:56,613
Speaker 0: I can't believe it, right?

756
00:53:57,657 --> 00:53:58,620
Speaker 1: I don't like them either.

757
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:12,560
Speaker 0: I don't want them to kick all the asses of all these people because even though I might you know Not have any you know loyalty to the the men of the tusk Right the characters that I've grown on are in with this side.

758
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:22,956
Speaker 0: So I that's the side that I'm sort of on even though from an objective sort of pie-in-the-sky Perspective the holy war is terrible and I hate it.

759
00:54:23,138 --> 00:54:24,063
Speaker 0: It sucks It's.

760
00:54:24,123 --> 00:54:25,792
Speaker 0: it's a giant crusade of evil.

761
00:54:26,053 --> 00:54:29,880
Speaker 1: the brilliance of these books And again, it all comes back to the fact that we keep word.

762
00:54:30,181 --> 00:54:35,720
Speaker 1: We're so intimately inside of characters heads and we only see things through the eyes of people in the books.

763
00:54:36,121 --> 00:54:40,516
Speaker 1: There's a brilliant scene later where a character says to him or herself.

764
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:41,800
Speaker 1: Am I crazy?

765
00:54:42,689 --> 00:54:43,639
Speaker 1: No, I'm not.

766
00:54:45,621 --> 00:54:51,840
Speaker 1: But this I keep saying brilliant I have to stop saying it but that I'm always rooting for whoever I am at the moment.

767
00:54:52,622 --> 00:55:00,129
Speaker 1: I'm always on the side of whoever I am and the fact that my loyalties as the and occasionally You're something bad.

768
00:55:00,471 --> 00:55:07,440
Speaker 1: Yes, but at the same time I Feel bad for whoever I am with even if they are a bad person.

769
00:55:07,962 --> 00:55:12,280
Speaker 1: Yep, the only person I don't feel bad for is Kellis because I don't know what to think about Kellis.

770
00:55:12,582 --> 00:55:15,620
Speaker 1: Well, I know what to think about Kellis, but that's because I've read two more books.

771
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:19,899
Speaker 0: But because he's callous, you don't know if what you think is what you should think or not.

772
00:55:20,221 --> 00:55:23,700
Speaker 0: Sometimes but for everyone else the picture is clear and the doubt is a race.

773
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:38,049
Speaker 1: But the fact that my loyalties as an external objective reader are so fickle Yep, and it's it's really surprising to me and sometimes I'd I'd stop reading at the end of a character's perspective thing and go Wait a minute.

774
00:55:38,069 --> 00:55:39,920
Speaker 1: I hate nayer.

775
00:55:40,881 --> 00:55:42,368
Speaker 1: Why was I rooting for him?

776
00:55:42,890 --> 00:55:44,979
Speaker 1: I hate him so much?

777
00:55:45,562 --> 00:55:49,200
Speaker 0: Well, I only root for him because he is foiling Kellis.

778
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:49,763
Speaker 1: So I hate.

779
00:55:50,084 --> 00:55:57,060
Speaker 1: but I think you root for him because when you're in his head to a degree You're him because you see identify with his frustration.

780
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:01,739
Speaker 1: You see what he sees and that's all these books are about is what do you see?

781
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:02,624
Speaker 0: What do you say?

782
00:56:02,744 --> 00:56:04,334
Speaker 1: because what you see is all yet be?

783
00:56:06,182 --> 00:56:19,378
Speaker 1: What you see is what you are because everything that you see is the darkness that came before and Kellis is the only person in the world except for mo Angus that we know of yes And I guess the rest of the dunyane who are hiding who can see?

784
00:56:20,042 --> 00:56:22,295
Speaker 0: Well that we know of and think of all the subtlety you look.

785
00:56:22,335 --> 00:56:34,531
Speaker 1: no because remember Early on and a lot of people when they read these they miss this very important point that the dunyane were woken up by Visions of mo Angus who had left at some point.

786
00:56:34,912 --> 00:56:37,300
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that's that's something that needs some clarification.

787
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,464
Speaker 0: It's not super obvious.

788
00:56:39,025 --> 00:56:43,860
Speaker 0: The reason Kellis Kellis is living with the dunyane being dunyane being basically hermit monks.

789
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,474
Speaker 0: Well, they're not really hermits there because they're not alone.

790
00:56:46,775 --> 00:56:50,232
Speaker 0: But you know that Collective hermit right there.

791
00:56:50,272 --> 00:56:51,520
Speaker 0: They're collectively they're a hermit.

792
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:56,881
Speaker 0: They're like monks living on the mountain never communicating with anyone staying hidden at the same time Castle.

793
00:56:57,041 --> 00:57:02,815
Speaker 1: actually some people have the gift they can see the onta and some people cannot.

794
00:57:03,076 --> 00:57:10,680
Speaker 1: people who can see it have the Capability to work magic even if they don't yep, and so obviously some of the dunyane have this capability, right?

795
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:16,559
Speaker 0: But anyway, the dunyane their monks living cut off from the world Kellis is with them.

796
00:57:17,322 --> 00:57:19,692
Speaker 0: Mo Angus left them at some point in the past.

797
00:57:19,732 --> 00:57:21,500
Speaker 0: We don't know why we don't know much about it.

798
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:30,528
Speaker 0: All we know is that mo Angus sent dreams back to them via magical powers and the the dunyane that saw these dreams Decided they could Brooke it no more.

799
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:32,737
Speaker 1: So they send Kellis out.

800
00:57:32,857 --> 00:57:34,142
Speaker 1: It's funny out It's all.

801
00:57:34,203 --> 00:57:42,638
Speaker 1: you get the impression that they did not bother telling Kellis what he had to do Because naturally they knew that he would do it because they came before him.

802
00:57:42,679 --> 00:57:48,131
Speaker 0: Yep They're just like, you know Kellis go out and deal with these dreams that were sent to us by.

803
00:57:48,151 --> 00:57:54,633
Speaker 1: that is that scene where he walks out into the world Forgets that he was a man and then remembers.

804
00:57:54,914 --> 00:57:57,323
Speaker 1: Yep is so beautifully written.

805
00:57:57,985 --> 00:58:04,740
Speaker 0: and then the dunyane that had the dreams go down into the labyrinths and They're done with themselves.

806
00:58:04,825 --> 00:58:12,119
Speaker 1: Yes It is so subtly implied that all the dunyane that received these dreams killed themselves because they were tainted.

807
00:58:12,179 --> 00:58:15,159
Speaker 0: somehow Perhaps they were someone came before them.

808
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:24,896
Speaker 0: So rather than let you know someone get the best of them or or you know No longer, you know coming before they off themselves that they would end.

809
00:58:24,916 --> 00:58:28,528
Speaker 1: so to ponder And this is the funny thing again.

810
00:58:28,568 --> 00:58:37,099
Speaker 1: This is the only question in the first book that Kellis is ever grappling with Did Bo Angus come before me or do I come before him?

811
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:40,985
Speaker 0: Yep, and then all right Come before me.

812
00:58:41,005 --> 00:58:41,828
Speaker 0: Can I get ahead of him?

813
00:58:41,868 --> 00:58:45,000
Speaker 1: But if when guess left did he come before the rest of the dunyane?

814
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:50,140
Speaker 1: Well, he definitely came before the ones that often because that is something that is very interesting.

815
00:58:50,581 --> 00:59:06,968
Speaker 1: Maybe what makes mo Angus and Kellis what made mo Angus leave and what makes Kellis be the one to go out to get him Is their blood because the dunyane don't seem to believe in that magic or all these things should exist because they can't understand or control It or whatever other reason we don't really know.

816
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:14,308
Speaker 0: but yet even if mo Angus came before the dunyane But the dunyane made him what he is So did they come before themselves.

817
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:22,719
Speaker 1: but this hints at the fact that there is something to The blood of the Anna syramore that makes it different independent of the dunyane.

818
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:27,595
Speaker 0: But that can't be because that would be something after coming before.

819
00:59:27,795 --> 00:59:29,340
Speaker 0: that's reverse causality.

820
00:59:29,842 --> 00:59:41,489
Speaker 0: It is because a lot of it basically that's one thing that you it's not Super explicit, but whenever someone talks about prophecy, right as in you know This is a sign of something to come.

821
00:59:41,871 --> 00:59:43,700
Speaker 0: Kellis says no, that's impossible.

822
00:59:44,141 --> 00:59:48,694
Speaker 0: Something that comes after cannot come before, you know cannot affect which comes before.

823
00:59:49,015 --> 00:59:50,960
Speaker 0: and you think wait, how is that prophecy?

824
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:51,756
Speaker 0: Well think about it.

825
00:59:52,201 --> 00:59:55,188
Speaker 0: Let's say there's an apocalypse that's gonna happen 50 years from now.

826
00:59:55,649 --> 01:00:01,844
Speaker 0: and I know that's gonna happen because just now like this second There was an eclipse.

827
01:00:02,145 --> 01:00:07,680
Speaker 0: Let's I'm just making this up right and eclipse now is a sign of an apocalypse in the future.

828
01:00:08,212 --> 01:00:16,897
Speaker 0: Okay So the one way of looking at it is that Apocalypse that that eclipse is the cause of the apocalypse.

829
01:00:16,917 --> 01:00:20,533
Speaker 0: that would make sense But that's not what you're saying when you say that it's a prophecy.

830
01:00:20,834 --> 01:00:25,700
Speaker 0: when you're saying it's a prophecy You're saying the apocalypse is a foregone conclusion.

831
01:00:26,082 --> 01:00:34,673
Speaker 0: It happened and it has caused the apocalypse of the future Caused the Eclipse now and that is not something that can be.

832
01:00:34,693 --> 01:00:43,039
Speaker 0: if you're with the dunyane mindset Or the logos, you know something that comes later cannot cause something to happen.

833
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:45,167
Speaker 0: now It hasn't happened yet.

834
01:00:45,207 --> 01:00:46,231
Speaker 0: How could it cause anything?

835
01:00:46,271 --> 01:00:46,974
Speaker 0: It's way out there.

836
01:00:48,299 --> 01:00:54,171
Speaker 1: Ah But anyway well there will address at least one academic issue because one.

837
01:00:54,211 --> 01:01:08,170
Speaker 1: well first one thing that gets brought up a lot and I'll admit I saw this in the beginning - it is very easy to Feel as though a came Ian's relationship with his students was homosexual And there is some of that going on there.

838
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:11,721
Speaker 1: what I see in that is mostly a use of One.

839
01:01:12,143 --> 01:01:18,519
Speaker 1: as someone else other than me pointed out so eloquently this goodness book does not beat around the sexuality at all.

840
01:01:18,579 --> 01:01:26,399
Speaker 1: people Like men only refer to other men in these tender terms, but at the same time how many women are in these books?

841
01:01:27,741 --> 01:01:29,251
Speaker 0: Two that we really get to know.

842
01:01:29,271 --> 01:01:30,700
Speaker 1: Yes, exactly.

843
01:01:31,041 --> 01:01:37,096
Speaker 1: But in regardless, I think it's just because a came Ian uses very very no, no.

844
01:01:37,116 --> 01:01:45,946
Speaker 1: three There's that the zero the Empress lady a lot of a came Ian and Proyas in particular and all the all the people surrounding them price.

845
01:01:46,492 --> 01:01:49,764
Speaker 1: you use very Praysha price shit.

846
01:01:50,226 --> 01:01:51,432
Speaker 1: P. R. P. R. O.

847
01:01:51,673 --> 01:01:52,677
Speaker 0: Y. His nickname is.

848
01:01:52,697 --> 01:02:00,637
Speaker 0: they call him price Yeah, which always sort of struck me is sort of like a Yiddish name like, you know The price yeah, you do in there.

849
01:02:01,781 --> 01:02:03,026
Speaker 0: It just sort of felt like that.

850
01:02:03,207 --> 01:02:03,830
Speaker 1: That makes sense.

851
01:02:04,091 --> 01:02:07,642
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the fact moisture Motion.

852
01:02:08,064 --> 01:02:08,405
Speaker 1: All right.

853
01:02:08,545 --> 01:02:08,746
Speaker 0: Okay.

854
01:02:09,067 --> 01:02:10,332
Speaker 1: I almost lost my train of thought.

855
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:10,774
Speaker 0: That's all right.

856
01:02:11,195 --> 01:02:11,657
Speaker 0: But here we go.

857
01:02:11,697 --> 01:02:12,460
Speaker 0: My Yiddish can do that.

858
01:02:12,741 --> 01:02:13,242
Speaker 1: Yes, it can.

859
01:02:13,282 --> 01:02:14,185
Speaker 1: Yiddish often has this.

860
01:02:14,225 --> 01:02:15,348
Speaker 0: Yiddish often comes before.

861
01:02:15,769 --> 01:02:23,050
Speaker 1: but the language that a came Ian uses both in his head and when speaking When referring to his students, there's a lot they've been.

862
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:24,073
Speaker 1: it's referred to as love.

863
01:02:24,253 --> 01:02:26,540
Speaker 1: There's some people described it as a feminine language.

864
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:39,774
Speaker 1: I wouldn't go that far but I would say that it's definitely the language that is used is a kind of phrasing that would imply in a modern setting Homosexuality to a lot of people on the one hand like when it when they start.

865
01:02:39,794 --> 01:02:51,070
Speaker 0: when that stuff was coming in I was sort of like cuz he trying to make this out to be gay, but I sort of just took it at Ophelia or fraternal Definitely impression that I get.

866
01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:59,160
Speaker 1: that's corroborated by other things I've read since then but yeah, I get the impression that that that is there is nothing more than tenderness and filial peaty.

867
01:02:59,461 --> 01:03:01,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, people got to learn that word filial.

868
01:03:02,090 --> 01:03:03,054
Speaker 0: That's an important word.

869
01:03:03,134 --> 01:03:04,580
Speaker 1: Yes, especially in these books.

870
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:07,184
Speaker 0: Yes filial love learn it, but then you have it.

871
01:03:07,224 --> 01:03:16,750
Speaker 1: probably that leads right into the accusations that these books are sexist and These are accusations that are very easy to make and very difficult to deny.

872
01:03:17,823 --> 01:03:26,229
Speaker 0: well, you know, but the Name of fantasy book does not sexy The ones that involve matriarchal societies.

873
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:30,926
Speaker 0: Yeah, but even those are that some of those are reversed Usually most of those.

874
01:03:30,946 --> 01:03:38,028
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, come on like you could have like, you know Battle of the Amazons what it's just sexist still.

875
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:42,700
Speaker 1: well, I guess the point I would make is I mean Wonder Woman still sexist.

876
01:03:42,984 --> 01:04:03,283
Speaker 1: We've gone on for over an hour So I'm not gonna belabor the point but the way I would approach this is that it is set in a very realistic world and human society in these eras was generally women did not have a lot of opportunities to for advancement and the books are following a war a foreign war.

877
01:04:03,303 --> 01:04:06,994
Speaker 1: it is very unlikely that there would be many women involved in this at all.

878
01:04:07,415 --> 01:04:20,710
Speaker 1: and I guess by Putting that by making it just a completely gender neutral world one would have removed a lot of the reflections that the book casts upon Our modern world and the things that us as humans actually do and did.

879
01:04:21,031 --> 01:04:27,090
Speaker 0: it's strange how I was often noticing in this book Right how it is a fantasy world.

880
01:04:27,311 --> 01:04:33,487
Speaker 0: right and you look at a fantasy world like say No, look at look at say Middle Earth.

881
01:04:33,547 --> 01:04:34,991
Speaker 0: right Middle Earth doesn't really have.

882
01:04:35,272 --> 01:04:39,746
Speaker 0: you know a lot of things the in it I mean besides trees, right?

883
01:04:39,806 --> 01:04:44,380
Speaker 0: I mean you don't have the same animals that you have in the normal world so much.

884
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:47,936
Speaker 0: You know, it's it's different, you know fantasy animals in Middle Earth and such right.

885
01:04:47,976 --> 01:04:55,180
Speaker 0: but in this book is You know half the things would be fantasy things and half the things we real-world things like you just be like.

886
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:59,697
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, a guy had camels and horses and it's like this camels and horses and we just.

887
01:04:59,737 --> 01:05:03,655
Speaker 0: he just says horse It doesn't even bother, you know, it's just normal horses like in the real world.

888
01:05:03,695 --> 01:05:03,855
Speaker 0: yet.

889
01:05:04,197 --> 01:05:09,640
Speaker 0: There's magic That's not in the real world and it's just this total mixture right going on right there.

890
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:19,880
Speaker 0: So he's obviously kept the sort of societal structures of you know The Middle Ages and the Crusades when women were not so hot?

891
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:20,525
Speaker 0: Well, they were.

892
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:25,519
Speaker 0: probably they were hot in one way, but you know They were not doing too well with the civil liberties and such.

893
01:05:26,141 --> 01:05:38,736
Speaker 0: But he changes a whole bunch of other things and seeing which things are just taken directly from the real world Honestly, I would say is most of these books right and which things are the fantasy world right?

894
01:05:38,756 --> 01:05:47,855
Speaker 0: that is that is mixed in is a huge part of what's going on, but in terms of There are two I guess female main characters among one.

895
01:05:47,875 --> 01:05:48,317
Speaker 0: That's good.

896
01:05:48,377 --> 01:05:49,260
Speaker 0: It wasn't as bad.

897
01:05:49,681 --> 01:05:53,513
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is sir way was a product of her upbringing.

898
01:05:53,754 --> 01:05:55,459
Speaker 1: her upbringing came before her.

899
01:05:55,942 --> 01:05:59,159
Speaker 0: Hey quite so and I do pointed many blue babies.

900
01:06:00,822 --> 01:06:02,149
Speaker 1: I feels I can't.

901
01:06:02,852 --> 01:06:06,650
Speaker 1: I can't dislike her But I can't dis I can't.

902
01:06:06,751 --> 01:06:08,240
Speaker 0: truly just I can.

903
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:10,767
Speaker 0: There's a point at which you can.

904
01:06:11,088 --> 01:06:13,176
Speaker 1: but at the same time what made her that way?

905
01:06:13,196 --> 01:06:14,320
Speaker 1: and did she ever have a choice?

906
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:15,894
Speaker 0: I don't think she had much.

907
01:06:15,934 --> 01:06:24,933
Speaker 1: well She had a choice, but did she didn't know she had a choice, but I would put basically I don't want to talk about all these other ancillary issues because I don't really want to.

908
01:06:25,234 --> 01:06:32,945
Speaker 1: we've already gone on long enough and we Got to talk about the book we're doing next time anyway, yes So what I would say is that how many main characters are there?

909
01:06:33,245 --> 01:06:35,028
Speaker 1: and out of them two are women?

910
01:06:35,088 --> 01:06:41,337
Speaker 1: So it's not as Overbalanced as it would be easy to believe because of the main characters.

911
01:06:41,377 --> 01:06:44,534
Speaker 1: There are two substantially important female characters.

912
01:06:44,856 --> 01:06:50,934
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Think about it those female characters whatever, you know negative, you know things.

913
01:06:50,974 --> 01:06:53,040
Speaker 0: they're portrayed as having betrayed.

914
01:06:53,221 --> 01:06:57,020
Speaker 1: No worse than the male characters ever callous except for callous.

915
01:06:57,181 --> 01:07:01,743
Speaker 0: But you know everyone else gets owned just as much as they get owned Right there.

916
01:07:01,904 --> 01:07:04,820
Speaker 0: own the everything's equal owning all around.

917
01:07:05,201 --> 01:07:10,260
Speaker 0: In fact, there are many men that get owned quite a lot more than the women get owned.

918
01:07:10,561 --> 01:07:18,040
Speaker 1: And you know as people bring up that there's a lot of rape in these books again There is equal raping among all genders sad and species.

919
01:07:18,263 --> 01:07:27,596
Speaker 1: It is quite unpleasant But at the same time the whole the rape thing and this comes up a lot more in the second third books not raping all the time but what that is.

920
01:07:27,656 --> 01:07:37,739
Speaker 1: because if Darkness comes before and people are the products of what came before What is the best way to control a person but to control their biology if nothing else?

921
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,605
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the skin spies.

922
01:07:40,086 --> 01:07:44,220
Speaker 1: this is kind of hinted at and it is pretty much explained explicitly later in the books.

923
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:58,598
Speaker 1: I don't feel badly and spoiling it but the skin spies are controlled primarily by the fact that as biological beings Controlling their brains and their hormones and their lust controls them better than any technology ever could.

924
01:07:58,618 --> 01:08:02,810
Speaker 1: Yep, and That is kind of what all of that rape is.

925
01:08:03,513 --> 01:08:03,674
Speaker 0: Yep.

926
01:08:03,834 --> 01:08:09,539
Speaker 1: It's it's technology taken to the amoral immoral extreme.

927
01:08:11,417 --> 01:08:25,609
Speaker 1: Oh Crow demons, okay so Okay, I guess I just I don't feel that these books are unduly sexist because any aspersions that are cast upon the female characters are No worse than the aspersions cast upon the male characters.

928
01:08:25,649 --> 01:08:32,654
Speaker 1: and I think a came Ian probably comes out the least Aspersed to make up some cromulent words of all.

929
01:08:32,877 --> 01:08:33,058
Speaker 1: Yeah.

930
01:08:33,078 --> 01:08:33,439
Speaker 0: All right.

931
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,908
Speaker 0: So the next book we're gonna do.

932
01:08:35,929 --> 01:08:38,840
Speaker 0: if you've looked at the website you probably you know to get this episode.

933
01:08:38,941 --> 01:08:40,639
Speaker 0: You probably already know what the next book is.

934
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:44,596
Speaker 0: But if not, we saved to be decided not to tell you till the end of the episode.

935
01:08:44,617 --> 01:08:45,359
Speaker 0: so it could be a surprise.

936
01:08:46,301 --> 01:08:48,319
Speaker 0: We're gonna do the episode about this book.

937
01:08:50,042 --> 01:08:51,840
Speaker 0: Let's do it eight weeks from now.

938
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:58,340
Speaker 0: So there's gonna be three Thursday episodes that are not book of the month or book of the whatever book episodes.

939
01:08:58,541 --> 01:09:00,028
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's gonna be a book episode.

940
01:09:00,048 --> 01:09:02,500
Speaker 1: realize that not everyone reads quite as quickly as we do.

941
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:05,640
Speaker 0: So you're gonna have three non book Thursday episodes.

942
01:09:06,002 --> 01:09:09,960
Speaker 0: Then the fourth one from now is gonna be about the book that we're gonna do next.

943
01:09:10,087 --> 01:09:13,331
Speaker 1: well keep this short because I don't think you shouldn't need to be sold on this.

944
01:09:13,371 --> 01:09:34,515
Speaker 1: this if the prince of nothing and the darkness that comes before and the warrior prophet and the thousandfold thought and all these are Scott backer books are Revolutionary or amazing words of literature that are coming out now or that are recent snow crash by Neal Stephenson is a Revolutionary work that is old and we now are we

945
01:09:34,616 --> 01:09:35,299
Speaker 0: actually from the early 90s

946
01:09:36,113 --> 01:09:36,298
Speaker 1: old?

947
01:09:38,444 --> 01:09:53,260
Speaker 1: But we've gotten to the point where Technology has shown us that Neal Stephenson was very very Very ahead of his time and brought the ideas that he talks about have been brought to reality to a frightening degree.

948
01:09:53,319 --> 01:09:57,060
Speaker 0: They're pretty much really three modern writers.

949
01:09:57,221 --> 01:10:01,173
Speaker 0: We're probably do books by all of them at some point, you know over who knows how long right.

950
01:10:01,374 --> 01:10:03,864
Speaker 0: that is sort of like the geek Right.

951
01:10:03,884 --> 01:10:06,040
Speaker 0: Well, there's maybe four if you throw Terry Pratchett in there.

952
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:13,589
Speaker 0: There's Neil Gaiman Neal Stephenson, William Gibson and Terry Pratchett are like the geek Novelist gods of the present time.

953
01:10:13,669 --> 01:10:14,051
Speaker 0: sort of it.

954
01:10:14,071 --> 01:10:14,834
Speaker 0: get any I don't know.

955
01:10:14,854 --> 01:10:16,320
Speaker 0: maybe you could throw someone else in there.

956
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:27,120
Speaker 0: yes, yeah, but those are pretty much the four and Neal Stephenson snow crash is pretty much The baby couldn't really think of a better starting place if we're gonna go down that road.

957
01:10:27,321 --> 01:10:31,779
Speaker 1: No, the one thing I want to bring it cuz if this should be the five-minute, you know With a book just to get you know.

958
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:32,639
Speaker 1: This is what the book is.

959
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:37,093
Speaker 0: But I imagine most people listening to geek nights have read it or should have.

960
01:10:37,153 --> 01:10:41,406
Speaker 1: but if you read this book now Not knowing when it was written.

961
01:10:41,908 --> 01:10:42,369
Speaker 1: It's easy.

962
01:10:42,390 --> 01:10:46,947
Speaker 1: I mean with one exception one idea This is a reason.

963
01:10:47,772 --> 01:10:49,339
Speaker 1: No listening to reason is just awesome.

964
01:10:49,921 --> 01:10:53,714
Speaker 1: But the the thing with the languages.

965
01:10:53,734 --> 01:10:55,340
Speaker 0: Oh, right, right, right.

966
01:10:55,621 --> 01:11:03,565
Speaker 1: The rest of it the cyberspace the technology all these things is very pedestrian very done-it-done-before old.

967
01:11:03,686 --> 01:11:09,880
Speaker 0: it seems like You know the stuff about cyberspace really seems like a bad sci-fi channel original.

968
01:11:10,061 --> 01:11:20,360
Speaker 1: And I remember I was reading this book for the first time and I'm reading his description of cyberspace and I'm thinking yeah It's kind of like that, but he really kind of missed it on a few things.

969
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:24,234
Speaker 1: But in you know, the spirit is pretty much spot-on is in the early 90s.

970
01:11:24,295 --> 01:11:28,100
Speaker 1: Yes, like the first one I flip back and I looked at this book was written in freaking.

971
01:11:32,763 --> 01:11:37,660
Speaker 1: This book describes a thing Cyberspace that did not yet exist.

972
01:11:38,381 --> 01:11:40,489
Speaker 1: Muds were around and that was all you had.

973
01:11:40,549 --> 01:11:43,080
Speaker 0: the well pretty much a new idea with this realm.

974
01:11:43,281 --> 01:11:47,061
Speaker 1: The first MMO did not appear until late 1996.

975
01:11:47,061 --> 01:11:51,549
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah this book Was so prescient.

976
01:11:51,689 --> 01:11:52,151
Speaker 1: it came.

977
01:11:52,231 --> 01:11:53,918
Speaker 0: it came before it sure did.

978
01:11:55,702 --> 01:11:56,966
Speaker 0: Not only that but this is a book.

979
01:11:57,367 --> 01:11:58,190
Speaker 0: it is humorous.

980
01:11:58,652 --> 01:12:00,217
Speaker 0: It has a lot of humor going on.

981
01:12:00,678 --> 01:12:03,212
Speaker 0: It has Pretty cool characters.

982
01:12:03,595 --> 01:12:06,065
Speaker 0: It has cool Sci-fi action.

983
01:12:06,728 --> 01:12:10,280
Speaker 0: It's got all sorts of cool ideas going on.

984
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:14,280
Speaker 1: The whole thing with the burb claves and the kind of balkanization of society.

985
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:24,042
Speaker 0: Yeah, really really really full-on libertarian privatization of absolutely everything but including roads and land and Themselves.

986
01:12:24,102 --> 01:12:37,327
Speaker 1: a lot of that really reminded me just for it for a number of reasons because I guess I recently read hocus-pocus Again, but and by Kurt Vonnegut and I was reminded of it in many occurrences Mmm, I gotta read some hocus-pocus.

987
01:12:37,768 --> 01:12:40,116
Speaker 1: That's it's one of my favorite Kurt Vonnegut's.

988
01:12:40,738 --> 01:12:41,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a good one.

989
01:12:42,651 --> 01:12:45,320
Speaker 0: so Snow crash by Neal Stephenson.

990
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:47,248
Speaker 0: I imagine many of you have read it at least.

991
01:12:47,288 --> 01:12:50,260
Speaker 0: I hope more of you have read this than have read Prince of Nothing.

992
01:12:50,441 --> 01:12:55,742
Speaker 0: You know because I can understand if you didn't know about Prince of Nothing if you didn't know about snow crash a little less Understandable.

993
01:12:56,324 --> 01:13:06,284
Speaker 0: So if you haven't read this, this is like required geek reading material for all right I so Snow crash good.

994
01:13:06,304 --> 01:13:12,604
Speaker 1: Yeah, the way I would deal to say it is that snow crash is not necessarily the best written book I cannot look at.

995
01:13:12,664 --> 01:13:22,817
Speaker 1: I would not put Neal Stephenson on the pedestal that I've put our Scott backer or a lot of other authors Because for one I'll say this I think Neal Stephenson as good of an author as he is writes shit.

996
01:13:22,977 --> 01:13:26,228
Speaker 1: action scenes Yeah, I think his action scenes are crap.

997
01:13:26,729 --> 01:13:30,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, the the skateboarding scene at the beginning of snow crash is okay.

998
01:13:30,261 --> 01:13:36,600
Speaker 0: so the other action scenes not so good like with It's the raven action scenes not so great.

999
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:41,320
Speaker 1: But at the same time the way raven it described reminds me a little bit of nair.

1000
01:13:41,721 --> 01:13:44,092
Speaker 0: Do we have to read the most famous quote from this book?

1001
01:13:44,554 --> 01:13:45,579
Speaker 1: Do I think we might have to?

1002
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:49,218
Speaker 0: All right, let it said it on the show before I know but I have to find it.

1003
01:13:49,841 --> 01:14:01,560
Speaker 1: But this is one of those things like if you're if you consider yourself an anime fan Even if you do not like neon Genesis Evangelion, you should have seen it because it is a revolutionary work of animation.

1004
01:14:02,102 --> 01:14:13,699
Speaker 1: By the same token if you like science fiction or you were a technology geek Even if you do not like Neal Stephenson or you do not like snow crash You should have read it because it is a revolutionary work.

1005
01:14:15,085 --> 01:14:15,917
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like even.

1006
01:14:15,977 --> 01:14:22,964
Speaker 0: you know I do that I do this with comics all the time is even if I don't like a comic if it's significant or important You know, I read it.

1007
01:14:23,044 --> 01:14:36,887
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's like if you don't like Citizen Kane fine, you should still have seen it Until a man is 25.

1008
01:14:36,887 --> 01:14:42,359
Speaker 0: He still thinks every so often that under the right circumstances He could be the baddest motherfucker in the world.

1009
01:14:42,861 --> 01:15:06,656
Speaker 0: If I moved to a martial arts monastery in China and studied real hard for 10 years if my family was wiped out by Colombian drug dealers and I swore myself to revenge if I got a fatal disease had one year to live Devoted it to wiping out street crime if I just dropped out and devoted my life to being bad Hero used to feel that way too, but then he ran into Raven in a way.

1010
01:15:06,677 --> 01:15:07,680
Speaker 0: This is liberating.

1011
01:15:08,162 --> 01:15:11,580
Speaker 0: He no longer has to worry about trying to be the baddest motherfucker in the world.

1012
01:15:12,021 --> 01:15:15,009
Speaker 0: The position is taken the crowning touch.

1013
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:23,269
Speaker 0: the one thing that really puts true world-class bad motherfucker them totally out of reach of course is the hydrogen bomb.

1014
01:15:23,289 --> 01:15:27,251
Speaker 0: if It wasn't for the hydrogen bomb a man could still aspire.

1015
01:15:27,752 --> 01:15:29,719
Speaker 0: maybe find Ravens Achilles heel.

1016
01:15:30,483 --> 01:15:33,859
Speaker 0: Sneak up get a drop slip a Mickey pull a fast one.

1017
01:15:34,522 --> 01:15:40,564
Speaker 0: But Ravens nuclear umbrella kind of puts the world title out of reach Which is okay.

1018
01:15:41,045 --> 01:15:46,339
Speaker 0: Sometimes it's all right to just be a little bad to know your limitations make do with what you got.

1019
01:15:48,102 --> 01:15:51,820
Speaker 1: And of course if that doesn't work, he might listen to reason.

1020
01:16:00,341 --> 01:16:02,547
