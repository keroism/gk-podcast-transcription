1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,527
Speaker 0: It's Monday, July 31st, 2023 on RIM.

2
00:00:12,825 --> 00:00:13,320
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,220
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights Tonight, where we're talking about when, how, why, and if to upgrade your tech.

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,018
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,420
Speaker 0: So Emily is off in Michigan with family for about a week, week and a half, maybe two weeks in determinate length.

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:39,320
Speaker 0: As much as I wanted to go, I have too much actual work to do and I don't know if vacation day is to just disappear for two more weeks, considering I've disappeared for several weeks along the way.

7
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,259
Speaker 0: And unlike certain individuals, I don't get every Monday off.

8
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:43,439
Speaker 0: That's a shame.

9
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,140
Speaker 0: That's a damn shame.

10
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,860
Speaker 0: But the thing I did last night is there's a confluence of all these factors.

11
00:00:51,161 --> 00:00:55,440
Speaker 0: And some of what I'm about to talk about briefly in our opening bit is not for the benefit of Scott.

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:10,000
Speaker 0: It's for the benefit of the listener who might not understand how different parks are in a place like New York City compared to pretty much any other place in America, but especially non-cities in America.

13
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,960
Speaker 0: So when I was a kid in Michigan, there was one really good thing about living in Michigan.

14
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,440
Speaker 0: And that was the fact that that time zone is the same time zone as New York City.

15
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:21,278
Speaker 0: And what does that mean?

16
00:01:21,861 --> 00:01:28,540
Speaker 0: It stays light for almost an hour longer at night because you're on the other end of the same time zone.

17
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,739
Speaker 0: So when it's dark here, there is still sunlight where I grew up.

18
00:01:33,602 --> 00:01:40,340
Speaker 1: So, you know, I'm always, you know, if you're in a time zone, it's best to be on like the westish side of it no matter what.

19
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:47,380
Speaker 0: Because I remember as a kid, like it doesn't get dark until like nine forty five at night in like the peak of summer.

20
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:50,139
Speaker 0: And that was just something that I really missed when I moved to New York.

21
00:01:50,602 --> 00:01:50,763
Speaker 1: Right.

22
00:01:50,783 --> 00:01:53,240
Speaker 1: It's because we didn't do like gradual time.

23
00:01:53,522 --> 00:01:53,847
Speaker 1: Right.

24
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:54,739
Speaker 1: It's for good reasons.

25
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,580
Speaker 0: Gradual time does not work as America discovered.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,202
Speaker 1: Right.

27
00:01:58,222 --> 00:02:00,080
Speaker 1: It would be logistically impossible to be.

28
00:02:00,943 --> 00:02:04,840
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm on the east side of Queens and you're on the west side.

29
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,180
Speaker 1: So I'm a minute earlier than you as a technically you are.

30
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,700
Speaker 0: That turns into I'm heading upstate to one hundred and twenty fifth street.

31
00:02:12,303 --> 00:02:13,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll be there.

32
00:02:13,131 --> 00:02:14,080
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, exactly.

33
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:20,980
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, so because of that, it's like time zones have to have a width of about an hour of sunlight.

34
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:27,419
Speaker 1: And so you can get an extra hour of sunlight on the west side or an hour earlier sunlight on the east side.

35
00:02:28,042 --> 00:02:30,960
Speaker 0: So I was reminded of this because, you know, Emily is off.

36
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,626
Speaker 0: I had finished a day of travel and I'm.

37
00:02:32,707 --> 00:02:35,960
Speaker 0: I'm in the park because I'm out night biking, which is my real opening bit.

38
00:02:36,261 --> 00:02:38,939
Speaker 0: I'm just biking around at night in New York because it's real fun to do that.

39
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,626
Speaker 0: And Emily calls me and we're chatting.

40
00:02:41,686 --> 00:02:46,300
Speaker 0: And yeah, she reminds me that the sun is still visible where she is.

41
00:02:46,521 --> 00:02:48,193
Speaker 0: And it is dark out where I am.

42
00:02:48,455 --> 00:02:49,100
Speaker 0: And I'm like, fuck.

43
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:49,824
Speaker 1: And it's the same.

44
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:50,732
Speaker 1: But it's the same time.

45
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:51,579
Speaker 0: Exact same time.

46
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:52,341
Speaker 1: Yep.

47
00:02:52,683 --> 00:02:52,924
Speaker 0: Yep.

48
00:02:53,186 --> 00:02:55,340
Speaker 0: So which reminded me of something else.

49
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,834
Speaker 0: When I was a kid, I was something I was very angry about, like kid.

50
00:03:00,995 --> 00:03:09,140
Speaker 0: angry about, like in middle school and high school, that all the parks and every suburb and subdivision and even Detroit that I ever lived in closed at night.

51
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:15,300
Speaker 0: Like cops would check to see if kids were hanging out in the park and they would fucking come after you if they saw you.

52
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,959
Speaker 0: Like you could not openly hang out in a park at night.

53
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,700
Speaker 1: Or at least they'd ask you to leave.

54
00:03:19,941 --> 00:03:20,343
Speaker 0: Yeah.

55
00:03:20,806 --> 00:03:23,560
Speaker 0: So for a brief time, Sterling Heights had a curfew.

56
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:27,056
Speaker 0: They would write kids tickets and like take them in the cruiser.

57
00:03:27,076 --> 00:03:27,760
Speaker 0: And it was a whole thing.

58
00:03:28,682 --> 00:03:29,880
Speaker 0: Statute of limitations ran out.

59
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:36,203
Speaker 0: I might have run from such police on numerous occasions because I figured a teenager on a bicycle, what are the odds?

60
00:03:36,243 --> 00:03:39,199
Speaker 0: the cops are going to shoot me or run me over as opposed to giving up?

61
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,320
Speaker 0: Now, in retrospect, not the best bet to take against American cops, but here I am.

62
00:03:46,022 --> 00:03:55,580
Speaker 0: But I just remember being really mad about the fact that these are public spaces, but yet they are denied to people who are busy during the day or up at night.

63
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,560
Speaker 0: Like if you're, imagine you're lonely or you can't sleep.

64
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,658
Speaker 1: I mean, Central Park is closed at like, what, 1 a.m.

65
00:04:00,718 --> 00:04:00,940
Speaker 1: I think.

66
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,685
Speaker 0: Something like that.

67
00:04:01,705 --> 00:04:02,900
Speaker 0: There are parks in New York that close at night.

68
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,740
Speaker 1: Like you're technically not supposed to go in there after a certain time.

69
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:13,298
Speaker 0: But then there's parks like Queensbridge Park or Rainy Park where there is a party going on there until like 3 a.m.

70
00:04:13,338 --> 00:04:14,240
Speaker 0: most weekend nights.

71
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:19,454
Speaker 1: Technically, Queensbridge Park closes, I guess, at 9 a.m.

72
00:04:19,494 --> 00:04:20,839
Speaker 1: according to the park's website.

73
00:04:21,982 --> 00:04:29,560
Speaker 0: But according to the signs at the park, it doesn't seem to close because the lights are on all night in that park.

74
00:04:31,002 --> 00:04:35,040
Speaker 1: It effectively doesn't close even if there is some technical closing time.

75
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:45,880
Speaker 0: Because regardless of the law and the procedures and the nonsense, the reality is you go to Queensbridge Park or Rainy Park late at night, especially on like a Thursday, Friday, Saturday in the summer.

76
00:04:46,461 --> 00:04:53,440
Speaker 0: And there are, if you're not from New York City, way more people hanging out in that park than you would ever expect.

77
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,339
Speaker 1: There are more people in the park than the population of some of the small towns in those parks.

78
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:10,280
Speaker 0: So in biking around last night, just, you know, in the evening on a New York summer night, I encountered several small scenes I want to briefly share and then we can move on.

79
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,505
Speaker 0: Because it was just a birthday party.

80
00:05:12,726 --> 00:05:18,700
Speaker 0: So there was a family having like a gigantic barbecue.

81
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:28,000
Speaker 0: But they had all paused because one of the kids had their cell phone held up and it was sending audio to a Bluetooth speaker.

82
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,768
Speaker 0: And this was all in Spanish, but it was obvious.

83
00:05:30,828 --> 00:05:34,580
Speaker 0: this was a prank call show, like a classic crank call show.

84
00:05:35,242 --> 00:05:40,818
Speaker 0: And the entire family was like listening to this as an event while they're cooking.

85
00:05:40,838 --> 00:05:41,360
Speaker 0: It was great.

86
00:05:42,102 --> 00:05:44,999
Speaker 0: You can hear the moment where the dial tone happens because the other guy hung up.

87
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,620
Speaker 0: And like, it sounded like a comedy club, the amount of laughter coming out of this family.

88
00:05:50,881 --> 00:05:55,040
Speaker 0: There were two baseball teams having a hella fucking party, I assume their championship.

89
00:05:55,081 --> 00:05:55,820
Speaker 1: Are you sure it wasn't softball?

90
00:05:56,361 --> 00:05:57,267
Speaker 0: It might have been softball.

91
00:05:57,308 --> 00:05:59,020
Speaker 0: I didn't inspect too closely.

92
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,920
Speaker 1: I know Queensbridge has a lot of softball going on.

93
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:08,280
Speaker 0: I could definitely tell which team had won the game and which team had lost the game based on the way the two parties were evolving, which was really funny.

94
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:14,960
Speaker 0: A whole bunch of fireworks were going off from Roosevelt Island, like shit tons of fireworks.

95
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:25,280
Speaker 0: But then I hit in Rainy Park, I'm biking around up there, and I see a whole bunch of purple lights move around like crazy as I'm coming up toward the park.

96
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:27,851
Speaker 0: And I'm like, "What's going on over

97
00:06:27,891 --> 00:06:28,232
Speaker 0: there?".

98
00:06:28,353 --> 00:06:29,900
Speaker 0: Some sort of like kid rave at night.

99
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,349
Speaker 0: It was, and this is normally, you know, I might exaggerate.

100
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:38,259
Speaker 0: So older might say, or exaggerating might say, "There were 30 bikes

101
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:38,540
Speaker 0: there.".

102
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,004
Speaker 0: So I'm going to give the exact number.

103
00:06:40,505 --> 00:06:58,640
Speaker 0: There were more than 10, as far as I could count, like directly no exaggeration, white e-bikes with punk kids on them, doing tricks and hurting themselves, going crazy with these e-bikes on that big playground structure with the rock climbing thing on the left side of the park.

104
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:11,340
Speaker 0: Like, it was a situation where on one hand, a parent should probably have shown up to stop this, but on the other hand, props to you kids, I do the same fucking thing when I was your age.

105
00:07:11,981 --> 00:07:16,431
Speaker 1: The structure is basically like a manufactured hill.

106
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:20,280
Speaker 1: It's on a real hill, but then there's like a manufactured hill on the real hill.

107
00:07:20,682 --> 00:07:22,080
Speaker 0: This would be dangerous on a BMX bike.

108
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,800
Speaker 1: The slide is built into the hill rather than a slide sort of freestanding.

109
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,852
Speaker 0: This would be dangerous on a BMX bike, even for someone like me.

110
00:07:29,872 --> 00:07:32,460
Speaker 0: This is beyond dangerous.

111
00:07:32,921 --> 00:07:40,460
Speaker 1: As a slide though, it's a little safer than a regular slide because you can't like fall off the edge to your doom because it's just sort of built into a hill.

112
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,460
Speaker 1: So if you fall out of it, you're just sort of on the side of the hill.

113
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,723
Speaker 0: Not like that slide at the park.

114
00:07:44,763 --> 00:07:52,800
Speaker 0: I remember as a kid being like terrifyingly tall and then as an adult visiting Michigan, I went to that park thinking there was no way that slide was as tall as I remember.

115
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,186
Speaker 0: That slide was so fucking tall.

116
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:55,492
Speaker 0: I still cannot believe it.

117
00:07:55,532 --> 00:07:57,280
Speaker 0: It's allowed to stand and kids are allowed to play on it.

118
00:07:58,663 --> 00:08:00,780
Speaker 0: It wasn't the giant slide, which I have also written.

119
00:08:01,364 --> 00:08:03,540
Speaker 1: It was just the big slide, not the giant slide.

120
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,100
Speaker 0: It was the big slide, the giant slide I have written.

121
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:08,360
Speaker 1: The ginormous slide.

122
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,000
Speaker 1: You go down it, your friend's neck breaks.

123
00:08:14,283 --> 00:08:16,180
Speaker 0: The kid you ain't even had's neck breaks.

124
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:16,865
Speaker 1: Yeah.

125
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,219
Speaker 0: One of your ancestors' necks break.

126
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:21,281
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah.

127
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:22,903
Speaker 0: Anyway, that's a long way of saying.

128
00:08:23,084 --> 00:08:36,020
Speaker 0: if you're ever in New York City and you're capable of it, I highly recommend just renting a city bike and just biking around on bike paths at night, especially in the summer.

129
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:41,520
Speaker 0: It is a fun, pretty safe, wild time, and you're not going to experience this.

130
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,700
Speaker 1: It's just the same stuff you see during the day only at night.

131
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,867
Speaker 0: Yeah, but a little more shenanigans.

132
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:50,760
Speaker 0: Like, the kids on the e-bikes would not have been able to get away with that during the day.

133
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:58,040
Speaker 0: They would have gotten away with it for maybe an hour, but eventually a cop would have rolled up and gently scootled them.

134
00:08:58,942 --> 00:08:59,095
Speaker 1: Maybe.

135
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:00,943
Speaker 0: So, you got any news?

136
00:09:00,963 --> 00:09:04,897
Speaker 0: Because there's one big news that is permeating every tech conversation.

137
00:09:04,937 --> 00:09:05,880
Speaker 0: if you're an internet person.

138
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the news we're going to talk about.

139
00:09:07,951 --> 00:09:09,360
Speaker 1: We might have to do a whole show on it.

140
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,792
Speaker 0: We're definitely going to have to do a whole show on it.

141
00:09:10,812 --> 00:09:11,760
Speaker 0: This will not be comprehensive.

142
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,204
Speaker 1: We're going to have to blow the whole load, right?

143
00:09:13,244 --> 00:09:16,895
Speaker 1: But basically, Google, the Chrome people, they might add this feature.

144
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,033
Speaker 1: And the name that they have for the feature, what do they call it?

145
00:09:23,094 --> 00:09:24,840
Speaker 1: Web Integrity something something?

146
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:30,100
Speaker 1: The problem is Web Environment Integrity is what Chrome is calling it, right?

147
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,369
Speaker 1: And what this is, it's a form of attestation.

148
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,620
Speaker 1: So to make a good, you know, a classic analogy here, right?

149
00:09:37,121 --> 00:09:43,440
Speaker 1: You go to the club and you want to get in the club, but there's a bouncer at the club and the bouncer doesn't know who the hell you are, right?

150
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:59,020
Speaker 1: And now, but if there's someone standing there, maybe the owner of the club, maybe an alcohol vendor or a famous person or the act that's performing at the club or someone the bouncer knows, they can attest for you and say, no, no, no, this guy's legit.

151
00:09:59,400 --> 00:09:59,807
Speaker 1: Let him in.

152
00:10:00,316 --> 00:10:00,520
Speaker 1: Right.

153
00:10:01,222 --> 00:10:05,976
Speaker 1: And if there's no one there to attest for you, the bouncer is like, who the hell are you getting in?

154
00:10:06,277 --> 00:10:06,919
Speaker 1: End of story.

155
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:07,260
Speaker 1: Right.

156
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:18,140
Speaker 1: So the way this feature would work in Chrome is that you would visit a website and the website would say, hmm, who is this person coming to visit my website?

157
00:10:18,381 --> 00:10:20,990
Speaker 1: And they would say, who is the trusted person?

158
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:21,532
Speaker 1: Right.

159
00:10:21,552 --> 00:10:23,379
Speaker 1: Because obviously not a human isn't doing this.

160
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:23,700
Speaker 1: Right.

161
00:10:24,121 --> 00:10:28,255
Speaker 1: So the website says, who can I trust to see if this person is legit?

162
00:10:28,536 --> 00:10:29,620
Speaker 1: Well, fucking Google.

163
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:30,181
Speaker 1: Right.

164
00:10:30,482 --> 00:10:32,969
Speaker 1: So they go to Google and they're like, hey, Google.

165
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:33,530
Speaker 1: Right.

166
00:10:33,731 --> 00:10:35,916
Speaker 1: Is this Web visitor with this browser?

167
00:10:36,538 --> 00:10:37,300
Speaker 1: Are they legit?

168
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,140
Speaker 1: Right.

169
00:10:38,321 --> 00:10:40,045
Speaker 1: Should I let them visit my website?

170
00:10:40,586 --> 00:10:43,432
Speaker 1: And then Google will say yes or no.

171
00:10:43,573 --> 00:10:46,680
Speaker 1: And the way this is done is with some cryptographic biz.

172
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:51,772
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, Google contacts your computer and basically says, are they using Chrome?

173
00:10:52,393 --> 00:10:54,217
Speaker 1: Is the Chrome a legit Chrome?

174
00:10:54,258 --> 00:10:55,300
Speaker 1: Has it been modified?

175
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,021
Speaker 1: Hacked?

176
00:10:56,121 --> 00:10:56,943
Speaker 1: Is this a bot?

177
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:57,804
Speaker 1: Is this right?

178
00:10:58,345 --> 00:11:06,139
Speaker 1: And then the website would let you or would either send you HTML or if it doesn't like you, send you just an empty 401 response.

179
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,701
Speaker 1: It's like unauthorized.

180
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:08,582
Speaker 1: Get the hell out of here.

181
00:11:08,682 --> 00:11:23,760
Speaker 0: Now, before we go any further, I think I should point out that this concept, while it may have broad use cases and there's value in certain specific kinds of things, it is pretty directly antithetical to what the World Wide Web was intended to be.

182
00:11:24,941 --> 00:11:34,720
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, it's you have a Web server, you send it bits and then at its discretion, it sends you bits or it sends you different ones.

183
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,581
Speaker 1: It's their choice.

184
00:11:35,681 --> 00:11:35,841
Speaker 1: Right.

185
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:36,342
Speaker 1: You know, it's.

186
00:11:36,702 --> 00:11:39,145
Speaker 1: you know, it's obviously in spirit.

187
00:11:39,185 --> 00:11:39,686
Speaker 1: You're right.

188
00:11:39,826 --> 00:11:51,740
Speaker 0: But technically it's like because on the other hand, it is not fundamentally necessarily different than a Web site that requires a subscription or a password or some sort of exact access token.

189
00:11:52,481 --> 00:11:52,701
Speaker 1: Right.

190
00:11:52,761 --> 00:11:56,367
Speaker 1: So the good parts, this this technology does have good parts.

191
00:11:56,487 --> 00:11:56,688
Speaker 1: Right.

192
00:11:56,728 --> 00:11:58,731
Speaker 1: So Safari has already implemented this.

193
00:11:58,791 --> 00:11:59,572
Speaker 1: They call it.

194
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:01,094
Speaker 1: what do they call it?

195
00:12:01,295 --> 00:12:04,420
Speaker 1: Public something, something private.

196
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,023
Speaker 1: They call it private private access tokens.

197
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:07,344
Speaker 1: Right.

198
00:12:07,384 --> 00:12:08,185
Speaker 1: And what's the?

199
00:12:08,285 --> 00:12:13,633
Speaker 1: if you look at the Apple documentation for the feature in Safari, the way it works is you?

200
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,397
Speaker 1: the way that they they suggest developers use it?

201
00:12:16,917 --> 00:12:18,660
Speaker 1: is that, you know, you go to a Web site.

202
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,825
Speaker 1: The Web site goes to Apple and says, hey, is this Safari browser legit?

203
00:12:22,945 --> 00:12:36,620
Speaker 1: And if Apple says yes, that's a real Apple user with like, you know, who's using real Safari, then that means not that that Web site should just let you in, period, but that they could be like, oh, I know you're so legit because of the attestation.

204
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,082
Speaker 1: I'm not going to show you any captures.

205
00:12:38,442 --> 00:12:38,763
Speaker 1: Right.

206
00:12:39,203 --> 00:12:40,505
Speaker 1: And that's what Apple suggests.

207
00:12:40,525 --> 00:12:43,088
Speaker 1: They're like, hey, reduce captures for our users.

208
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,571
Speaker 1: use if you're going to capture someone.

209
00:12:45,991 --> 00:12:46,152
Speaker 1: Right.

210
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:48,194
Speaker 1: Instead of doing that, do this first.

211
00:12:48,715 --> 00:12:52,279
Speaker 1: And if you don't like it, if that gives you a bad result, then show a capture.

212
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:52,880
Speaker 1: Right.

213
00:12:52,960 --> 00:13:04,150
Speaker 1: And theoretically, if people implement the feature, users would get less captures, which is good for usability, for people who can't even solve a captured people with disabilities.

214
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:07,212
Speaker 1: It's, you know, makes the Internet just better overall.

215
00:13:07,232 --> 00:13:07,773
Speaker 1: Right.

216
00:13:08,033 --> 00:13:09,534
Speaker 1: It's like that's a very good thing.

217
00:13:10,876 --> 00:13:15,880
Speaker 1: If Apple vouching for you means captures are gone or Google vouching for you means captures are gone.

218
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,702
Speaker 1: There are other legitimate uses as well.

219
00:13:19,062 --> 00:13:28,689
Speaker 1: But obviously the illegitimate use would be I have come to this Web site and Google says, ah, this person is using Chrome, but they got ad block.

220
00:13:28,869 --> 00:13:31,711
Speaker 1: So don't let them visit your Web site because you won't make any money.

221
00:13:32,251 --> 00:13:33,131
Speaker 1: Right.

222
00:13:33,432 --> 00:13:35,253
Speaker 1: And then they block you because you have ad block.

223
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:41,917
Speaker 1: Now, that's sort of you know, it's sort of like this slippery slope doomsday scenario.

224
00:13:42,077 --> 00:13:42,378
Speaker 1: Right.

225
00:13:42,518 --> 00:13:44,999
Speaker 1: And it's like on the one hand, it's like, yeah, that's way bad.

226
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:45,920
Speaker 1: Right.

227
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,805
Speaker 1: But is anyone actually going to implement it that way?

228
00:13:50,985 --> 00:13:51,165
Speaker 1: Right.

229
00:13:51,345 --> 00:13:53,688
Speaker 1: Is the slope going to slip to the bottom?

230
00:13:53,708 --> 00:14:02,560
Speaker 0: And that's a really important question, because historically these things have not gone down that road because nerds just won't use services that go down.

231
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:02,780
Speaker 0: Right.

232
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,063
Speaker 1: It's like it's like, sure, Google might put this feature in their browser.

233
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:07,584
Speaker 1: Right.

234
00:14:07,664 --> 00:14:08,925
Speaker 1: And so might everyone.

235
00:14:09,045 --> 00:14:12,028
Speaker 1: All the major browser vendors might all implement this.

236
00:14:12,148 --> 00:14:12,368
Speaker 1: Right.

237
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:27,340
Speaker 1: But will major Web sites, you know, important Web sites actually go through with, you know, implementing the harshest, you know, situation of block anyone who is using any modified browser of any kind.

238
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,343
Speaker 0: I do think there's one class of Web site that likely will.

239
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:37,912
Speaker 0: But I think that class of Web site is the kind of Web site that today aggressively attempts to block people are using ad blockers already.

240
00:14:38,773 --> 00:14:38,973
Speaker 1: Yeah.

241
00:14:39,073 --> 00:14:44,820
Speaker 1: And it's like if you're if you're blocked from going to those Web sites, I don't see much loss there.

242
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,160
Speaker 0: No.

243
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:45,400
Speaker 0: Right.

244
00:14:45,461 --> 00:14:49,724
Speaker 0: Why go to the unified Web site that's telling you it's unified.

245
00:14:50,305 --> 00:14:50,745
Speaker 1: Exactly.

246
00:14:50,805 --> 00:14:52,647
Speaker 1: Now, a big major Web site.

247
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,247
Speaker 1: Right.

248
00:14:53,287 --> 00:14:56,210
Speaker 1: Like maybe like a news, a big major news Web site.

249
00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:03,496
Speaker 1: If they start blocking all the people who have ad blocks, it's like they're already not blocking people who are bypassing their paywalls with special tools.

250
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,017
Speaker 1: Right.

251
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:07,840
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, but even if they did, I don't think they will.

252
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,983
Speaker 1: Because, number one, there's going to be a lot of false positives.

253
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:17,108
Speaker 1: Anyone using any older technology, any weird is suddenly going to be able to go to like New York Times, CNN.

254
00:15:17,288 --> 00:15:26,956
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, their numbers that they see in their metrics of like how many people visit their Web sites would drop precipitously because right now they're benefiting.

255
00:15:27,316 --> 00:15:27,516
Speaker 1: Right.

256
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,638
Speaker 1: Marketing people love fake numbers.

257
00:15:29,798 --> 00:15:29,958
Speaker 1: Right.

258
00:15:29,978 --> 00:15:31,480
Speaker 1: That are falsely inflated.

259
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:31,880
Speaker 1: Right.

260
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:42,668
Speaker 0: I mean, I could legitimately give a extremely wide range of the number of listeners to geek nights based on all perfectly plausible mathematical models.

261
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:42,868
Speaker 0: Yeah.

262
00:15:42,928 --> 00:15:43,629
Speaker 1: Think about other.

263
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:47,832
Speaker 1: you know, it's like they love to tell people that, you know, a huge number like this.

264
00:15:47,872 --> 00:15:49,974
Speaker 1: How many people visited our Web site this month?

265
00:15:49,994 --> 00:15:51,155
Speaker 1: That's why you should buy ads.

266
00:15:51,175 --> 00:15:58,040
Speaker 1: You'll get so many eyeballs if they actually had to give a real number because they actually blocked all the bots and all the other.

267
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:58,620
Speaker 1: Right.

268
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,663
Speaker 1: If they had to give an honest number, it's like they might like to know that number.

269
00:16:03,324 --> 00:16:03,504
Speaker 1: Right.

270
00:16:03,904 --> 00:16:07,546
Speaker 1: They might implement the technology just to count to see the truth.

271
00:16:07,887 --> 00:16:15,712
Speaker 1: How many actual humans with unmodified browsers are uniquely visiting us, you know, on a whatever time period basis.

272
00:16:16,272 --> 00:16:20,735
Speaker 1: But to actually block everyone else, that means they would have to go tell advertisers.

273
00:16:20,755 --> 00:16:21,016
Speaker 1: Yeah.

274
00:16:21,336 --> 00:16:25,419
Speaker 1: Only like one million people actually only for real, only like one million.

275
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:27,520
Speaker 1: And they'd be like, that's way smaller than number.

276
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,681
Speaker 1: You've been telling us for years.

277
00:16:28,781 --> 00:16:29,061
Speaker 1: Yeah.

278
00:16:29,181 --> 00:16:29,381
Speaker 1: Right.

279
00:16:29,701 --> 00:16:34,285
Speaker 1: Why would we buy ads from you to only get that many eyeballs if that's the true number?

280
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:34,805
Speaker 1: Right.

281
00:16:34,965 --> 00:16:37,447
Speaker 1: They don't want the true number to be out there.

282
00:16:37,807 --> 00:16:38,027
Speaker 1: Right.

283
00:16:38,467 --> 00:16:40,529
Speaker 1: So I don't know if anyone will actually do that.

284
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:42,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, because that's that's an arms race.

285
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:50,055
Speaker 0: Once that true number is revealed, then that is probably equally harmful to the advertising ecosystem as ad blocks are.

286
00:16:50,695 --> 00:16:50,896
Speaker 1: Yeah.

287
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,637
Speaker 1: There's also the situation of like.

288
00:16:52,697 --> 00:16:55,058
Speaker 1: you could use this technology in reverse.

289
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:57,500
Speaker 1: You could block anyone who doesn't have ad blocks.

290
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,242
Speaker 1: You could be like, oh, you've got an unmodified Chrome.

291
00:17:00,302 --> 00:17:00,742
Speaker 1: Guess what?

292
00:17:00,822 --> 00:17:02,003
Speaker 1: You can't visit my website.

293
00:17:02,864 --> 00:17:04,704
Speaker 1: You better have some kind of modification.

294
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:05,585
Speaker 1: So I know you're a nerd.

295
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:06,306
Speaker 1: Nerds only.

296
00:17:06,465 --> 00:17:17,874
Speaker 0: That's why I would say I'd love to be able to go down the opposite route directly, like all the people who blocked every checkmark on Twitter back when Twitter is still usable slightly block anyone who doesn't have ad block from your website.

297
00:17:18,374 --> 00:17:18,554
Speaker 1: Yeah.

298
00:17:18,794 --> 00:17:22,837
Speaker 1: There could be other security things going on to write like a bank website.

299
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,758
Speaker 1: Now, the banks haven't even implemented to F.A.

300
00:17:24,818 --> 00:17:25,299
Speaker 1: properly.

301
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,440
Speaker 1: So are they really going to implement this right?

302
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:35,800
Speaker 1: But even if they did implement it, it's like, are they really going to block all their customers and deal with the customer support problems that they're going to have as a result?

303
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,204
Speaker 1: I don't think they're actually going to do that now.

304
00:17:39,245 --> 00:17:41,990
Speaker 1: And even if they went that far, there's a good way they could do it.

305
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:44,434
Speaker 1: They could say, look, your browser's out of date.

306
00:17:44,474 --> 00:17:48,220
Speaker 1: We're only allowing people with up to date browsers to visit the bank website.

307
00:17:48,782 --> 00:17:52,234
Speaker 1: And just if you if you're not up to date, they'll give you a message, update your shit.

308
00:17:52,334 --> 00:17:52,675
Speaker 1: And you know what?

309
00:17:52,695 --> 00:17:54,060
Speaker 1: That could be positive, actually.

310
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:54,360
Speaker 0: Yeah.

311
00:17:54,561 --> 00:17:54,802
Speaker 1: Right.

312
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:59,860
Speaker 1: They could give you the message to update your shit and still let you in to at your own risk.

313
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,683
Speaker 0: My theory is what the direction.

314
00:18:01,703 --> 00:18:03,306
Speaker 0: This is almost a sideshow.

315
00:18:03,406 --> 00:18:10,700
Speaker 0: I worry because the direction every company I think is actually going to go is trying to not have websites and force everyone into apps.

316
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:13,120
Speaker 0: Like that's been the dream of capitalism forever.

317
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:13,560
Speaker 1: Right.

318
00:18:13,601 --> 00:18:19,119
Speaker 1: But it's like, you know, if it's app only, it's like, all right, you know what you do.

319
00:18:20,002 --> 00:18:24,580
Speaker 0: I mean, I generally avoid app only things because, you know, reasons mostly.

320
00:18:25,741 --> 00:18:30,350
Speaker 1: I mean, if there is a thing that is app only, I will avoid that thing generally.

321
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:34,518
Speaker 1: Like there's a lot of, you know, we've seen a lot of social networks crop up that are like app only websites.

322
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,548
Speaker 1: But for example, my bank, it's like I can use.

323
00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:43,320
Speaker 1: I can use the website or the app and it's like I use both depending on when I'm doing.

324
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,384
Speaker 0: But they're different use cases.

325
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:47,340
Speaker 0: I use the app for like very specific things when I have my phone.

326
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:55,820
Speaker 0: But if I'm doing like banking, like anything complex at all, of course, I have a website open because I'm probably moving money around between a bunch of accounts or doing something complex.

327
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,021
Speaker 1: Yeah.

328
00:18:57,041 --> 00:19:04,300
Speaker 1: I mean, it'll take a long you know, the Web would have to like really collapse for big companies to actually, you know, turn that shit out.

329
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:15,260
Speaker 1: I think that what's in my eye estimation, what's actually going to happen if this goes through and actually becomes a thing is the websites that will block you are websites you didn't want to go to anyway.

330
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:16,866
Speaker 1: And you'll be happy that they block you.

331
00:19:16,926 --> 00:19:19,215
Speaker 0: You know, I'm going to make a ticket.

332
00:19:19,255 --> 00:19:20,379
Speaker 0: master is going to implement it.

333
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,002
Speaker 1: Maybe, maybe.

334
00:19:22,342 --> 00:19:26,188
Speaker 1: But the other places right there, there will be workarounds, right?

335
00:19:26,228 --> 00:19:27,310
Speaker 1: You'll be able to set up like.

336
00:19:27,691 --> 00:19:33,440
Speaker 1: you'll either just have like a chrome on the side that's unmodified that you can use in those special cases.

337
00:19:34,142 --> 00:19:34,343
Speaker 1: Right.

338
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,512
Speaker 1: And then you'll have your other browser used for everything.

339
00:19:36,632 --> 00:19:37,234
Speaker 0: Real browser.

340
00:19:37,275 --> 00:19:38,178
Speaker 1: You'll have like a proxy.

341
00:19:39,441 --> 00:19:39,621
Speaker 1: Yeah.

342
00:19:39,641 --> 00:19:41,466
Speaker 1: You'll have some sort of proxy browser.

343
00:19:41,787 --> 00:19:42,208
Speaker 1: Right.

344
00:19:42,329 --> 00:19:46,480
Speaker 1: Or it's like and I don't think this piehole kind of ad blocking will be stopped by this.

345
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:46,880
Speaker 1: Right.

346
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:52,298
Speaker 1: It's like you verified that my iPhone has been unmodified and has the legit safari on it.

347
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:52,820
Speaker 1: Right.

348
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,384
Speaker 1: And I haven't modified it in any way.

349
00:19:55,544 --> 00:19:56,766
Speaker 1: I'm attested by Apple.

350
00:19:57,146 --> 00:19:58,027
Speaker 1: Show me the website.

351
00:19:58,108 --> 00:20:06,700
Speaker 1: And then they send me the HTML and then all the DNS requests to all the advertisement sites are returned up with no result because I have a piehole in my house.

352
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:06,940
Speaker 1: Right.

353
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,623
Speaker 1: It's like that's not going to stop that.

354
00:20:08,763 --> 00:20:12,349
Speaker 1: So there's plenty of workarounds for this.

355
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:17,517
Speaker 1: It's not like the end of the world, but people are acting like it's the end of the world because they're looking at the.

356
00:20:17,537 --> 00:20:19,520
Speaker 1: you know, I'm not saying like it's good.

357
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,421
Speaker 1: Like I would be.

358
00:20:20,521 --> 00:20:22,002
Speaker 1: I think I would be happier if they just.

359
00:20:22,082 --> 00:20:33,130
Speaker 0: I think part of what's happening is that the kinds of people who even know like the FSF exists and like no are capable of understanding the possible dangers of things like this.

360
00:20:34,531 --> 00:20:39,915
Speaker 0: are the kinds of people who have had to raise alarm bells for lots of dangerous tech for so long.

361
00:20:40,256 --> 00:20:45,680
Speaker 0: that kind of like with climate change, unless you describe an apocalyptic scenario, nobody gives a shit.

362
00:20:46,361 --> 00:20:46,601
Speaker 1: Right.

363
00:20:47,001 --> 00:20:53,150
Speaker 1: So it would be much better if the people, you know, crying that the sky is falling one were on their side.

364
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:53,751
Speaker 1: Right.

365
00:20:54,412 --> 00:21:00,260
Speaker 1: Even though there are some positive uses, like I said, getting rid of captions that I would enjoy and would be good overall.

366
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:06,444
Speaker 1: But the apocalyptic scenarios that they're describing, I don't think are unlikely.

367
00:21:06,524 --> 00:21:11,188
Speaker 1: I think it will be a. you know, it will be a a slope, but they will.

368
00:21:11,328 --> 00:21:16,232
Speaker 1: The reality is that if it goes through, we will not go to the bottom of the slope.

369
00:21:16,272 --> 00:21:19,134
Speaker 1: We will go somewhere down the slope, but not to the bottom.

370
00:21:19,495 --> 00:21:24,559
Speaker 1: And it'll be sort of some good things will happen in some things will happen.

371
00:21:24,939 --> 00:21:25,880
Speaker 1: And, you know.

372
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:26,280
Speaker 0: Yeah.

373
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:33,485
Speaker 0: One thing I did see, not that I am advocating the Brave browser, because I do not personally trust any niche.

374
00:21:33,545 --> 00:21:34,526
Speaker 1: I don't trust that shit.

375
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:39,270
Speaker 0: But they did announce they will never support web environment integrity APIs.

376
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:39,970
Speaker 1: Right.

377
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,572
Speaker 1: It's really not going to be decided by the browsers.

378
00:21:42,632 --> 00:21:44,473
Speaker 1: It's going to be decided by the websites.

379
00:21:44,573 --> 00:21:48,476
Speaker 1: Will the web, you know, each and every different website can choose for itself.

380
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:53,480
Speaker 1: Are you going to allow people to visit or are you going to keep things the way they are?

381
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:59,944
Speaker 1: Are you going to check attestation, you know, to, you know, are you going to like a bouncer could just look at you and let you in?

382
00:22:00,004 --> 00:22:00,204
Speaker 1: Right.

383
00:22:00,725 --> 00:22:04,868
Speaker 1: Are you going to tell your bouncer to check everyone to see if they're legit?

384
00:22:05,308 --> 00:22:05,528
Speaker 1: Right.

385
00:22:05,608 --> 00:22:06,989
Speaker 1: And maybe let them in and meet.

386
00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:07,189
Speaker 1: Right.

387
00:22:07,249 --> 00:22:08,170
Speaker 1: It's like it's up to you.

388
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:11,072
Speaker 1: So it's like what the majority of websites do.

389
00:22:11,492 --> 00:22:16,415
Speaker 1: And if and how they implement this, that will determine what's going on.

390
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:16,836
Speaker 1: Right.

391
00:22:16,896 --> 00:22:18,617
Speaker 1: But if the major browsers.

392
00:22:19,217 --> 00:22:19,457
Speaker 1: Right.

393
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:23,560
Speaker 1: If they safaris already has it, but if Google doesn't do it, if they will.

394
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:30,065
Speaker 1: They win their battle and Google doesn't implement it in Chrome, that takes the decision out of the website's hands because now they can't do it.

395
00:22:30,085 --> 00:22:31,086
Speaker 1: They'd be right.

396
00:22:31,126 --> 00:22:32,847
Speaker 1: blocking every Chrome browser in the universe.

397
00:22:33,047 --> 00:22:33,207
Speaker 1: Right.

398
00:22:33,247 --> 00:22:38,712
Speaker 0: So which is probably short term is a better option just to avoid even having to address.

399
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:49,640
Speaker 1: But if Chrome does add the feature and deploys it in a stable release to every Chrome browser out there, then it will be in the hands of the websites individually and then and also collectively.

400
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:55,964
Speaker 0: I would bet money fucking Ticketmaster ad implements it as fast as possible.

401
00:22:56,064 --> 00:23:01,368
Speaker 1: If we get to that point, maybe that's the kind of website that might want to attest.

402
00:23:01,448 --> 00:23:03,850
Speaker 0: visitor, you know, some of that anyway.

403
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:10,094
Speaker 0: So not to blow our load, but we'll probably talk about this as a whole show at some point, because there's a lot of details to unpack.

404
00:23:10,194 --> 00:23:14,317
Speaker 1: I think well, I think, you know, rather than do it right away, let's wait until we see how it pans.

405
00:23:14,377 --> 00:23:14,997
Speaker 1: Oh, absolutely.

406
00:23:15,037 --> 00:23:17,999
Speaker 1: This is not like the next time there's a big shift in the news.

407
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:18,780
Speaker 1: Right.

408
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,041
Speaker 1: Of like a decision point.

409
00:23:20,361 --> 00:23:23,343
Speaker 1: that actually happened, like it's deployed in Chrome everywhere.

410
00:23:23,864 --> 00:23:25,885
Speaker 1: Then we can do a whole episode.

411
00:23:25,925 --> 00:23:27,106
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a good line.

412
00:23:27,687 --> 00:23:36,993
Speaker 0: So in some other news, I think we both talked about how this would be the absolutely best idea for any news organization to do as Twitter has.

413
00:23:37,154 --> 00:23:45,780
Speaker 0: Well, the app formerly known as Twitter has collapsed into ruin and the BBC did it like earlier today, less than 12 hours ago.

414
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:57,569
Speaker 0: The BBC just went live with social BBC, which is the BBC's own single official Mastodon instance, and the only accounts on it are official BBC content.

415
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:01,972
Speaker 1: What if a BBC person who is on there loses their job?

416
00:24:02,032 --> 00:24:05,455
Speaker 1: Are they just managing it the same way you manage, like email accounts at the BBC?

417
00:24:05,515 --> 00:24:07,356
Speaker 0: I think they're managing it just like that right now.

418
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:10,419
Speaker 0: It looks like it is only official official accounts.

419
00:24:10,459 --> 00:24:12,260
Speaker 0: They've started just with studio.

420
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:12,660
Speaker 1: I see.

421
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,365
Speaker 1: So they don't have an individual account for each reporter and journalist.

422
00:24:16,405 --> 00:24:20,590
Speaker 0: Now, if they do down the road, I am confident they'll do it the way a lot of organizations do.

423
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,251
Speaker 0: You know, like I work at a big organization.

424
00:24:22,832 --> 00:24:29,720
Speaker 0: If you have a public account to use for social media, that account is owned by the company, not by you, because you're obviously creating content.

425
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:35,464
Speaker 1: I think there could be an interesting tech setup, though, where like you have a BBC, like you're a journalist to the BBC.

426
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:37,765
Speaker 1: You have a you have an account on this instance.

427
00:24:38,206 --> 00:24:41,708
Speaker 1: You start, I guess, tweet messaging where you start posting messages.

428
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,869
Speaker 0: I refuse to say to.

429
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:46,311
Speaker 1: Yeah, posting messages from the field.

430
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:46,871
Speaker 1: Right.

431
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:56,238
Speaker 1: And then rather than them going public immediately, there's some editor whose only job is to like look at a feed of all the journalists sending all the messages until I click.

432
00:24:56,638 --> 00:24:59,220
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, no, yes, no, yes, no.

433
00:24:59,600 --> 00:24:59,700
Speaker 1: Right.

434
00:25:00,181 --> 00:25:07,956
Speaker 1: Like fact checking and spell checking and, you know, like every all the messages getting checked at some central place by like it would only take a handful of people.

435
00:25:07,996 --> 00:25:09,720
Speaker 1: How many messages are there really going to be?

436
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:09,900
Speaker 1: Right.

437
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:20,453
Speaker 0: So the other cool thing about this, they're very open about how this is an experiment and they're the research and development team is running it publicly to try this out.

438
00:25:21,154 --> 00:25:25,340
Speaker 1: And I think the problem that what I worry, I think they're going to do a great job.

439
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:29,226
Speaker 1: I think the problem is they might not get enough traffic right now.

440
00:25:29,306 --> 00:25:33,812
Speaker 1: It's like it's one of those things where like they dip the toe in the water and like, oh, too cold.

441
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:34,493
Speaker 1: Never mind.

442
00:25:34,593 --> 00:25:34,874
Speaker 1: Right.

443
00:25:34,894 --> 00:25:35,575
Speaker 1: It's like, no, no, no.

444
00:25:35,655 --> 00:25:36,236
Speaker 1: It doesn't work.

445
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:39,340
Speaker 1: You have to go all the way in the water and stay in there and acclimate.

446
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,201
Speaker 0: Kind of like all.

447
00:25:40,221 --> 00:25:49,000
Speaker 0: Then you can decide the news orgs like the BBC that in the early days of Twitter doubled down on Twitter back when nobody used Twitter.

448
00:25:49,661 --> 00:25:49,821
Speaker 1: Yep.

449
00:25:50,362 --> 00:25:50,663
Speaker 1: It's like.

450
00:25:50,863 --> 00:26:00,298
Speaker 1: it's like you have to make a real effort, stick with it for a long time, you know, and then once, you know, other people follow and then that will make it.

451
00:26:00,398 --> 00:26:01,300
Speaker 1: You have to make it work.

452
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:05,006
Speaker 1: You can't just see if it works like it's someone else doing the making it work part.

453
00:26:05,026 --> 00:26:08,131
Speaker 1: It's like, no, you're part of the making it work by going all in.

454
00:26:08,671 --> 00:26:10,094
Speaker 1: And that's the only way it can happen.

455
00:26:10,174 --> 00:26:14,140
Speaker 1: So now the cool part would be the next because their numbers are going to be low for a long time.

456
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:14,340
Speaker 1: Yeah.

457
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:14,621
Speaker 1: Right.

458
00:26:14,841 --> 00:26:23,992
Speaker 0: But the next step would be one, if these other apps and meta start implementing activity feed, then that's going to start driving this ecosystem.

459
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:29,800
Speaker 0: And two, if activity pub pub that provides a feed of activity.

460
00:26:30,661 --> 00:26:45,640
Speaker 0: But two, if another, like the second, the first follower, the next news org makes theirs and they cross federate and they start retweeting each other or like having the journalism conversations between each other that used to happen on Twitter.

461
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:57,340
Speaker 0: Because the beauty of that, if the BBC and unnamed news organization to do it that way, their reporters can verify stories and discuss with each other publicly the same way they used to do on Twitter.

462
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:06,234
Speaker 0: But Joey Jojo crypto fascist can't butt in and won't show up on either of their feeds if he's coming from his bullshit Nazi Mastodon server.

463
00:27:06,254 --> 00:27:07,235
Speaker 0: Yep.

464
00:27:07,796 --> 00:27:10,200
Speaker 0: They can implement Mastodon however they want.

465
00:27:11,861 --> 00:27:17,210
Speaker 0: So I've been whispering in the ear of a few friends I have for a pretty senior at several news orgs, not BBC, but other ones.

466
00:27:18,031 --> 00:27:21,377
Speaker 0: I have already emailed them being like, look, the BBC did what I suggested.

467
00:27:21,397 --> 00:27:22,579
Speaker 0: You should seriously try this out.

468
00:27:22,819 --> 00:27:23,360
Speaker 0: So let's see.

469
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:23,500
Speaker 0: Yeah.

470
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:31,388
Speaker 1: I want to see some, you know, associated press, some Reuters, you know, and some, uh, you know, even, even fucking news Corp.

471
00:27:31,428 --> 00:27:31,728
Speaker 1: Right.

472
00:27:31,828 --> 00:27:36,513
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, I could block your server, but it's like, you can make one.

473
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:39,395
Speaker 0: I want you to make one for me to block.

474
00:27:40,036 --> 00:27:40,536
Speaker 1: That's right.

475
00:27:41,898 --> 00:27:43,079
Speaker 0: That's a healthy internet.

476
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,100
Speaker 1: That's right.

477
00:27:45,901 --> 00:27:46,842
Speaker 0: So one last news.

478
00:27:46,882 --> 00:27:50,367
Speaker 0: I'm not going to dwell on it because we've gone on a little long, but, uh, it's a big deal.

479
00:27:51,028 --> 00:28:00,100
Speaker 0: The first new nuclear reactor in the U S that was built from scratch in several decades has entered commercial operation.

480
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:00,941
Speaker 0: It is live.

481
00:28:01,422 --> 00:28:10,878
Speaker 0: It is generating 25% of the total power output of Georgia power, the largest power company in like the Atlanta area.

482
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:11,980
Speaker 1: Let's fucking go.

483
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,003
Speaker 0: This is huge news.

484
00:28:14,043 --> 00:28:25,118
Speaker 0: This is as best I can tell, uh, I didn't read all the details of the reactor, but it is a generation three reactor, a light water reactor, which is so basically all the reactions.

485
00:28:25,238 --> 00:28:26,320
Speaker 1: It is a good kind.

486
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:26,840
Speaker 1: Yes.

487
00:28:27,121 --> 00:28:30,024
Speaker 0: Generally, basically generation one is like a pile.

488
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:37,794
Speaker 0: Like that's, that's just, that is no, no, uh, honorable or esteemed deeds are commemorated at a gen one reactor.

489
00:28:38,615 --> 00:28:42,620
Speaker 0: Gen two is what almost every nuclear power plant on earth is, except in like France.

490
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,563
Speaker 0: And they're the ugly bad ones.

491
00:28:44,603 --> 00:28:54,820
Speaker 0: Like Indian point generation three are the same basic technology as gen two, but built with modern ideas and modern designs and they are ludicrously safe.

492
00:28:55,361 --> 00:29:03,014
Speaker 0: Now you're going to see some stories complaining about how this project was like $17 billion over budget and took a lot longer than we expected.

493
00:29:03,335 --> 00:29:03,535
Speaker 0: Yeah.

494
00:29:04,196 --> 00:29:06,220
Speaker 0: Uh, I'd say that doesn't only sound cheap.

495
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:18,494
Speaker 0: It is cheap because the biggest mistake anyone advocating for realistic policies around energy or the environment in America has, or even Europe has ever done is talking about the dollars.

496
00:29:18,554 --> 00:29:24,180
Speaker 0: something costs because where it's not, we could spend those dollars somewhere else to do something different.

497
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,986
Speaker 0: And it's more, what are the externalities of this power versus other kinds of power?

498
00:29:29,247 --> 00:29:32,471
Speaker 0: The dollars are just a fiction of how you expend capital to make it happen.

499
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:43,047
Speaker 1: So if you don't do it, if you, if you're going to generate that power, the people of Georgia, I either, what will be the damage of not generating the power of the people of Georgia?

500
00:29:43,127 --> 00:29:44,509
Speaker 1: not having enough power, right?

501
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,853
Speaker 1: How much damage will that be that you just averted?

502
00:29:46,893 --> 00:29:50,620
Speaker 0: How many more coal and oil power plants would I have to spin up to cover this load?

503
00:29:50,640 --> 00:30:03,235
Speaker 1: Maybe if you use some other kind of power, right, uh, to generate that, those megawatts and you keep the people of Georgia powered, how much damage will be caused by that other kind of power you chose?

504
00:30:03,275 --> 00:30:07,020
Speaker 1: Now, maybe you chose wind or something that's not coal, right?

505
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,441
Speaker 1: But it's like how much.

506
00:30:08,702 --> 00:30:15,368
Speaker 1: then it's a question of, okay, neither, you've got more options that all don't really cause significant damage at least, right?

507
00:30:15,388 --> 00:30:19,572
Speaker 1: Like coal does, uh, which one gets you the most power per dollar, right?

508
00:30:19,873 --> 00:30:26,980
Speaker 1: And having 25% of an entire state's power with one facility sounds like efficient design to me.

509
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,850
Speaker 1: How many, how many wind, you know, it's not that I don't like wind, right?

510
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:34,337
Speaker 1: China just made like the wind's biggest world, right?

511
00:30:34,357 --> 00:30:35,440
Speaker 1: It's the biggest wind turbine in the world.

512
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:40,300
Speaker 0: I mean, in New York, unless something blocks it, we're going to get that ridiculous array feeding through Raven's Woods.

513
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,002
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see.

514
00:30:41,062 --> 00:30:46,340
Speaker 1: Not, you know, but not that I'm against wind, but like how many turbines would you know, and how much would they cost?

515
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,345
Speaker 1: Well, also there's more to the point.

516
00:30:49,365 --> 00:30:58,480
Speaker 0: We need, humans need a variety, like a heterogeneous environment of how we generate power so we can innovate in all these different areas simultaneously.

517
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:02,829
Speaker 0: And so they can compliment each other because they're all good at different kinds of power.

518
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:07,500
Speaker 0: And if you're a nerd and you want to learn about how much more complicated than this, then you can imagine.

519
00:31:07,861 --> 00:31:18,700
Speaker 0: Look up reactive power versus non-reactive power and why it's so hard to generate the amount and kind of electricity we need to power society.

520
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:25,979
Speaker 0: No one type of power generation technology will solve our problems for the foreseeable future of the Earth.

521
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:40,013
Speaker 0: So things of the day, an old standby in Geek Nights, I liked to find, you know, there's, we're really into anime music videos.

522
00:31:40,073 --> 00:31:43,759
Speaker 0: I'm still into anime music videos, like AMVs and like that sort of stuff.

523
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:44,680
Speaker 0: I just, I enjoy them.

524
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,062
Speaker 0: I even made one.

525
00:31:46,462 --> 00:31:52,813
Speaker 0: But I used to try to find whenever a different fandom has a similar culture.

526
00:31:52,853 --> 00:31:55,558
Speaker 0: Like I found all those Horatio Hornblower fan videos.

527
00:31:55,578 --> 00:31:56,420
Speaker 0: There were a lot of them.

528
00:31:57,461 --> 00:31:58,122
Speaker 0: This one's pretty good.

529
00:31:58,142 --> 00:31:59,004
Speaker 0: I just bumped into this.

530
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:07,160
Speaker 0: It is a music video just made by a fan to the movie Metropolis and the song Feed the Machine.

531
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:07,887
Speaker 1: Which Metropolis?

532
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,360
Speaker 1: The original Metropolis?

533
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, for playing Metropolis.

534
00:32:11,084 --> 00:32:11,379
Speaker 0: Okay.

535
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:20,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, if this was just an AMV to what anime, who was all involved, I forget who directed that.

536
00:32:20,701 --> 00:32:21,980
Speaker 1: Was that a Rintaro one, I think?

537
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:22,282
Speaker 1: Was it?

538
00:32:22,643 --> 00:32:23,387
Speaker 0: Anyway, I'll look it up.

539
00:32:23,427 --> 00:32:24,050
Speaker 0: We reviewed it.

540
00:32:24,091 --> 00:32:25,819
Speaker 0: God, how long ago saw that thing?

541
00:32:26,243 --> 00:32:27,999
Speaker 1: It was a Rintaro joint, yes.

542
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:33,809
Speaker 0: But this is a music video by a fan to Fritz Lang's Metropolis.

543
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:34,330
Speaker 0: And you know what?

544
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:40,420
Speaker 0: It's real good because that movie, pretty prescient to everything that's happening in society right now.

545
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,125
Speaker 0: If you've never actually watched Metropolis, you should see it at least once.

546
00:32:44,909 --> 00:32:50,420
Speaker 0: If you don't get the metaphor of what's going on in this music video, capitalism is just going to eat you, buddy.

547
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,458
Speaker 0: So what do you got?

548
00:32:53,341 --> 00:33:02,053
Speaker 1: Well, so in July 2020, I think, 1973, Bruce Lee, you know who Bruce Lee is, right?

549
00:33:02,954 --> 00:33:03,876
Speaker 1: That was when he died.

550
00:33:03,896 --> 00:33:05,898
Speaker 1: It was 50 years ago, right?

551
00:33:05,958 --> 00:33:06,980
Speaker 1: I wasn't even alive then.

552
00:33:08,181 --> 00:33:11,850
Speaker 1: And at the time that Bruce Lee died, he was 32.

553
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:16,943
Speaker 1: And a basketball player, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, was 25.

554
00:33:16,943 --> 00:33:22,640
Speaker 1: And I don't know how many people know this, that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bruce Lee, they were buddies, right?

555
00:33:23,342 --> 00:33:25,720
Speaker 0: I learned this one second ago.

556
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:26,640
Speaker 1: Right.

557
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,687
Speaker 1: It is a famous scene in Game of Death where they fight each other, right?

558
00:33:29,727 --> 00:33:34,458
Speaker 1: But Kareem was training with Bruce Lee at the time because he was like,

559
00:33:34,499 --> 00:33:34,739
Speaker 1: "Hey.".

560
00:33:35,601 --> 00:33:36,844
Speaker 1: Bruce Lee was getting famous.

561
00:33:36,944 --> 00:33:40,773
Speaker 1: Kareem saw him and was like, "Hey, look at how that guy's moving his body.

562
00:33:40,813 --> 00:33:41,936
Speaker 1: I'm a professional athlete.

563
00:33:41,956 --> 00:33:43,359
Speaker 1: That is relevant to what I

564
00:33:43,379 --> 00:33:43,540
Speaker 1: do."

565
00:33:43,941 --> 00:33:44,122
Speaker 1: Right?

566
00:33:44,162 --> 00:33:44,886
Speaker 1: "That can help me.

567
00:33:45,047 --> 00:33:47,137
Speaker 1: If I go and learn from that guy, that will help my

568
00:33:47,157 --> 00:33:47,660
Speaker 1: basketball.".

569
00:33:47,801 --> 00:33:51,280
Speaker 1: And well, he was excellent at basketball, so maybe he wasn't entirely wrong about that.

570
00:33:53,101 --> 00:34:00,973
Speaker 1: But anyway, so here's on the anniversary of the death of Bruce Lee, right?

571
00:34:00,993 --> 00:34:05,400
Speaker 1: Kareem uploaded to his blog/newsletter, right?

572
00:34:05,781 --> 00:34:10,071
Speaker 1: Basically, a thing that he had written about Bruce Lee, right?

573
00:34:10,091 --> 00:34:14,100
Speaker 1: Basically, there was a chapter in Kareem's autobiography about Bruce Lee.

574
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,620
Speaker 1: So he took the chapter from his own autobiography and put it on his newsletter, right?

575
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:22,005
Speaker 1: And so here you can read that chapter without having to buy his whole book.

576
00:34:23,147 --> 00:34:30,699
Speaker 1: It's not very long post, but the best part was a quote of Bruce Lee that I had not heard before, right?

577
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,966
Speaker 1: Where Bruce Lee said, what's the actual quote?

578
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:43,058
Speaker 1: "Ah, I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000

579
00:34:43,058 --> 00:34:43,197
Speaker 1: times.".

580
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:55,516
Speaker 1: So I think that was the big takeaway for me, is like, figure out that one kick you want to become perfect at, and just kick 10,000 times, right?

581
00:34:57,601 --> 00:35:02,011
Speaker 1: And then it's like, sure, you know what kick I'm going to do, but how are you going to stop it?

582
00:35:02,292 --> 00:35:06,020
Speaker 1: It's such a good kick, I've practiced it 10,000 times, it's going to hit you in the face every time.

583
00:35:08,721 --> 00:35:14,116
Speaker 1: Obviously it's a metaphor and not actual kicking, but it could be actual kicking, maybe that's what you're doing.

584
00:35:16,021 --> 00:35:19,499
Speaker 0: Being real good at kicking is a reasonably valuable thing to know.

585
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,891
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, it's like I've practiced computer 10,000 times, right?

586
00:35:22,931 --> 00:35:24,497
Speaker 1: I've practiced winning a board game 10,000 times.

587
00:35:27,001 --> 00:35:31,107
Speaker 0: In the meta moment, the Geek Nights Book Club book, this is how you lose the time war.

588
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:36,716
Speaker 0: We didn't do the show on Thursday last week, even though we both read the book, because I had a conflict to do.

589
00:35:36,957 --> 00:35:38,760
Speaker 0: that came up last minute for reasons.

590
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:50,920
Speaker 0: But we will do this show on the next Thursday episode, or if we don't have a Wednesday show, partly because we can't cover any SAG-AFTRA strike struck works, maybe we'll just-.

591
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,920
Speaker 1: How many struck works are we even seeing?

592
00:35:53,161 --> 00:35:53,717
Speaker 0: I mean, I am.

593
00:35:54,263 --> 00:36:01,500
Speaker 0: Anything we talk about is not going to be as- I mean, Nimona, top tier animated movie on Netflix, that's a struck work technically.

594
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,819
Speaker 1: I don't even have Netflix right now.

595
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,859
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you're not watching stuff that I am.

596
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,084
Speaker 0: No.

597
00:36:07,023 --> 00:36:09,720
Speaker 0: You ain't watching anything, so we might- No, I don't watch television.

598
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,370
Speaker 0: We might just do the Thursday show this week.

599
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:16,400
Speaker 0: so we can get this book club out of the way and I can announce the next two book choices.

600
00:36:17,401 --> 00:36:22,912
Speaker 0: If you haven't read this book yet, it is a short read, like a few hours tops.

601
00:36:23,293 --> 00:36:26,600
Speaker 0: It reads quick, there's stuff going on, I got some stuff to say.

602
00:36:26,961 --> 00:36:31,134
Speaker 1: Let's go back to some more substantial books for the, you know, because we had a few short ones.

603
00:36:31,154 --> 00:36:32,900
Speaker 1: We had Binti and we had this one, right?

604
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,559
Speaker 0: But let's keep it to like .6 Genji's or lower.

605
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,364
Speaker 1: Satanic versus is a fine length.

606
00:36:38,444 --> 00:36:43,800
Speaker 1: I can read that, I can check it out of the library and read it before I have to return it without extending it.

607
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:48,786
Speaker 0: I was learning a lot of detail about the Crimean War lately, which led me to

608
00:36:50,087 --> 00:36:50,408
Speaker 1: have a

609
00:36:50,768 --> 00:37:00,860
Speaker 0: strange feeling to read a book I have never actually read and I'm not going to pick it as the book club yet, but I kind of want to at some point, but I'm not going to put War and Peace on the list this time.

610
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,020
Speaker 1: No, at least War and Peace is fiction.

611
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,638
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I do want to read it.

612
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,260
Speaker 1: I tried to read Crime and Punishment one time.

613
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,867
Speaker 0: Crime and Punishment, that's a short read.

614
00:37:08,888 --> 00:37:09,993
Speaker 0: I read that in like a week.

615
00:37:10,657 --> 00:37:11,200
Speaker 1: I've read it twice.

616
00:37:11,802 --> 00:37:13,280
Speaker 1: I didn't stop reading because of the length.

617
00:37:13,661 --> 00:37:18,060
Speaker 0: Ah, Crime and Punishment is actually one of my favorite novels.

618
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:19,173
Speaker 1: Okay.

619
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,363
Speaker 0: There's a lot going on.

620
00:37:20,624 --> 00:37:24,820
Speaker 0: Good ol' Ross Kaldenkopf being a dipshit and then learning his lesson.

621
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,780
Speaker 0: He committed a crime and then he accepted his punishment.

622
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,059
Speaker 1: Dun dun.

623
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,218
Speaker 1: Spoilers.

624
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,000
Speaker 1: It was in the spoilers in the title.

625
00:37:36,041 --> 00:37:43,817
Speaker 0: Alright, so we have done a show a while ago on like upgrading computers and workstations specifically, but that was a very narrow show.

626
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:55,715
Speaker 1: But there's a lot of shows on like updating your software and this isn't, you know, but upgrading and stuff is a topic we have covered in the news and other times, but we haven't done a show on it and we need show ideas.

627
00:37:55,876 --> 00:37:56,439
Speaker 1: So let's go.

628
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:07,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, but also I think there's a, there's a good topic here because there is, I would argue, a very distinct difference between replacing something, possibly because it has failed in some way.

629
00:38:08,145 --> 00:38:09,239
Speaker 1: Or you broke it on purpose.

630
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:19,520
Speaker 0: Or upgrading something when you already have a thing that solves that kind of problem to have a better thing that solves that problem.

631
00:38:20,521 --> 00:38:23,980
Speaker 1: Just today in the Geek Nights Discord server that you can join, right?

632
00:38:24,281 --> 00:38:31,040
Speaker 1: We were discussing mechanical keyboards because 8BitDo came out with those new Nintendo Famicom style keyboards.

633
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, I almost made one of those my thing of the day because they look real stylish.

634
00:38:34,781 --> 00:38:38,719
Speaker 1: They look real stylish, but they look real impractical, especially the mouse, which we were commenting on.

635
00:38:39,261 --> 00:38:43,200
Speaker 1: But I think, I think they could be useful for some cool installation or special projects.

636
00:38:43,561 --> 00:38:48,180
Speaker 1: But regardless, it's like I talked about, hey, hey, look, I have a mechanical keyboard.

637
00:38:48,562 --> 00:38:50,169
Speaker 1: It has Cherry MX Brown switches.

638
00:38:50,189 --> 00:38:52,460
Speaker 1: It has USB cable, right?

639
00:38:52,962 --> 00:38:53,424
Speaker 1: It works.

640
00:38:53,926 --> 00:38:54,869
Speaker 1: It has backlights.

641
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:57,540
Speaker 1: I replaced the keycaps to much better keycaps.

642
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:07,180
Speaker 1: But it's like, well, now it's like I see and I covet, actually, not going to lie, all these fancy mechanical keyboards that I keep seeing popping up in my feeds all the time.

643
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,128
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh, that's cool.

644
00:39:08,249 --> 00:39:09,620
Speaker 1: That's a sweet one, right?

645
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:13,232
Speaker 0: Do not upgrade because you are covetous.

646
00:39:13,533 --> 00:39:14,878
Speaker 0: That is almost always a bad idea.

647
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:22,989
Speaker 1: And then I look down at my keyboard and I'm like, all right, in what way is that keyboard that I'm coveting really better than this one?

648
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,677
Speaker 1: It's a different style, maybe.

649
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:25,280
Speaker 1: Right.

650
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,128
Speaker 1: But it's I guess it's newer.

651
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,555
Speaker 1: Some of them are wireless.

652
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:31,688
Speaker 1: That's a slight improvement, but not much for a keyboard that never leaves the desk.

653
00:39:32,773 --> 00:39:34,700
Speaker 1: It might actually be a negative in some cases.

654
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,040
Speaker 1: Right.

655
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:37,364
Speaker 1: It's like there's nothing about them.

656
00:39:37,825 --> 00:39:41,310
Speaker 1: that is actually going to improve my day to day keyboarding.

657
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,107
Speaker 1: And this one works just fine.

658
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:44,012
Speaker 1: It works terrific.

659
00:39:44,112 --> 00:39:45,540
Speaker 1: In fact, now it's so awesome.

660
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,715
Speaker 1: And those and it's like and those ones that I covet, they ain't cheap.

661
00:39:48,957 --> 00:39:49,620
Speaker 1: They're expensive.

662
00:39:50,122 --> 00:39:54,660
Speaker 0: Now aesthetics could could in some situations be a reason to upgrade.

663
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:58,056
Speaker 1: For example, let's say if I had so much money that it didn't matter that.

664
00:39:58,097 --> 00:39:58,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, sure.

665
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,282
Speaker 0: Yeah.

666
00:39:59,302 --> 00:40:01,500
Speaker 0: But even then, having so much money that it doesn't matter.

667
00:40:01,601 --> 00:40:07,958
Speaker 0: That edges into the externalities of being wasteful by upgrading things too often, which is something you should consider as a person.

668
00:40:07,978 --> 00:40:08,139
Speaker 0: Yeah.

669
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:14,707
Speaker 0: But maybe let's say you street live streamed a lot more often with multiple camera angles and your keyboard was highly visible in those.

670
00:40:15,028 --> 00:40:18,340
Speaker 0: Then for aesthetic reasons might actually make a lot of sense.

671
00:40:19,244 --> 00:40:19,566
Speaker 1: Maybe.

672
00:40:19,948 --> 00:40:22,180
Speaker 0: But for your use case does not make a lot of sense.

673
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:30,160
Speaker 0: And meanwhile, I similarly that keyboard looks great, but I bought one hundred and eighty dollar DOS keyboard a long time ago.

674
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:30,723
Speaker 0: And guess what?

675
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:32,654
Speaker 0: It is in perfect condition.

676
00:40:33,338 --> 00:40:33,740
Speaker 1: Exactly.

677
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:34,381
Speaker 1: Right.

678
00:40:34,964 --> 00:40:38,720
Speaker 1: So I guess that's the first case when, you know, we're not talking about broken things.

679
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,880
Speaker 1: So when you should upgrade, it has to actually be an improvement.

680
00:40:43,121 --> 00:40:49,236
Speaker 1: You should be able to point and explain this will improve my life in a certain way.

681
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:55,818
Speaker 1: And if you can't name that way, then you're just throwing money.

682
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:00,140
Speaker 0: I'm going to throw out a doctrinaire product management term.

683
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:17,120
Speaker 0: The idea of a market problem, which abstractly just means is there a problem that someone out there has where they would be willing to spend some amount of money ostensibly on you to solve or mitigate that problem in some way.

684
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,924
Speaker 0: And that is a good way to frame.

685
00:41:19,205 --> 00:41:25,445
Speaker 0: any time you are purchasing anything in your life that isn't inconsequential or like food, though even then food, arguably.

686
00:41:25,767 --> 00:41:27,375
Speaker 0: My problem is I am hungry.

687
00:41:27,958 --> 00:41:28,400
Speaker 1: But yes.

688
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,846
Speaker 0: Do you need a keyboard?

689
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:32,020
Speaker 0: Like what are you going to use a keyboard for?

690
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:46,060
Speaker 0: If you need a keyboard, buy a keyboard, and then you have to evaluate what keyboard best solves your particular problem, because unlike product management, you're not trying to find the best keyboard for the abstract person out there.

691
00:41:46,341 --> 00:41:51,200
Speaker 0: You're trying to find the best keyboard for you in your exact specific situation.

692
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,623
Speaker 0: Money is a factor.

693
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:54,049
Speaker 0: Aesthetics are a factor.

694
00:41:54,149 --> 00:41:56,920
Speaker 0: Quality, workflow, what you do with your life are all factors there.

695
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:08,200
Speaker 1: Now, I think a good category to look at is cameras, because in the camera world, they have this thing called Gear Acquisition Syndrome.

696
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:09,703
Speaker 1: They call it GAS.

697
00:42:09,763 --> 00:42:11,188
Speaker 1: That's like the term they use.

698
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:15,320
Speaker 1: Because photographers love to buy new cameras and keep upgrading.

699
00:42:16,361 --> 00:42:20,860
Speaker 1: And since even in film cameras, camera companies are coming.

700
00:42:21,401 --> 00:42:24,349
Speaker 1: You think, look at computers, how much are they coming out with?

701
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:28,300
Speaker 1: It's like there are new cameras all the damn time.

702
00:42:29,582 --> 00:42:32,711
Speaker 1: They just keep updating those things constantly.

703
00:42:33,734 --> 00:42:35,640
Speaker 1: And you can switch brands to upgrade.

704
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:42,920
Speaker 1: Photographers love to sell all their shit in a huge pile and get a pile of money and then buy all new shit from a different company.

705
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,662
Speaker 0: You know who else sells this?

706
00:42:43,682 --> 00:42:45,567
Speaker 0: Audio engineers, podcasters, and DJs.

707
00:42:45,607 --> 00:42:50,680
Speaker 0: If you need any of this kind of technology, just go on eBay and you'll find pristine equipment for nothing.

708
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:57,355
Speaker 1: So I was watching some camera YouTube videos where they were interviewing photographers for reals.

709
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:59,720
Speaker 1: These are people who spent all day photography-ing.

710
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,106
Speaker 1: It's like their number one hobby.

711
00:43:01,488 --> 00:43:02,654
Speaker 1: They do it more than I bike.

712
00:43:02,734 --> 00:43:03,579
Speaker 1: That's how much they do it.

713
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:12,120
Speaker 1: And there were two different people who had the exact, seemingly, the exact opposite opinions, and they were both very, very convincing.

714
00:43:12,461 --> 00:43:12,701
Speaker 1: Right?

715
00:43:13,122 --> 00:43:19,337
Speaker 1: One photographer, when discussing gear acquisition syndrome, said, "Are you better than your

716
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:19,738
Speaker 1: camera?".

717
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:20,781
Speaker 1: Right?

718
00:43:21,102 --> 00:43:29,480
Speaker 1: It's like, sure, there is a better camera than your camera available because it literally, your camera is already old and this other camera is new.

719
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:32,776
Speaker 0: I heard that exact same phrase in the context of, "Are you better than your golf

720
00:43:32,816 --> 00:43:33,057
Speaker 0: clubs?".

721
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:34,542
Speaker 1: Right, exactly.

722
00:43:34,602 --> 00:43:45,340
Speaker 1: It's like if your skills aren't so great that the limiting factor is the equipment, you're taking the best photo you can take with that camera.

723
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:48,348
Speaker 1: And if you had a newer camera, you could take a better photo.

724
00:43:48,569 --> 00:43:52,800
Speaker 1: That means you're better than the camera and therefore you should go get a new one because you'll take a better photo.

725
00:43:53,180 --> 00:44:08,580
Speaker 1: But it's like if you could improve yourself, your own photography skills, your own eye, and take a better photo than the photos you've already taken with the camera you still have, why are you spending money to upgrade the equipment?

726
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,563
Speaker 1: That's not going to get you.

727
00:44:09,684 --> 00:44:13,440
Speaker 1: You're not going to take a better photo with that one because your skill is still the limiting factor.

728
00:44:14,001 --> 00:44:17,307
Speaker 1: So that's very convincing, right?

729
00:44:18,029 --> 00:44:21,054
Speaker 1: Now, another person had a different opinion, right?

730
00:44:21,315 --> 00:44:24,040
Speaker 1: Which is also very convincing and their opinion was this.

731
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:30,120
Speaker 1: There's the scene in Indiana Jones where the guy has the sword and Indiana just shoots him, right?

732
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:38,780
Speaker 1: And it's like if you're going into a fight and you show up with a sword and the other person has a gun, it's like, it makes no sense, right?

733
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:47,840
Speaker 1: It's like you should get, if you're going in to do a thing, you should bring the strongest, most powerful thing available, right?

734
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,508
Speaker 0: Well, case in point, I got my really nice pancake lens.

735
00:44:51,568 --> 00:44:55,220
Speaker 0: Like I love that lens, but it's not a zoom lens, just pancake lens.

736
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:58,067
Speaker 0: Like it just, it does, I got a, what's the term?

737
00:44:58,087 --> 00:44:58,709
Speaker 0: Zoom with your feet?

738
00:44:59,872 --> 00:45:02,640
Speaker 0: So I can take real good pictures with this thing, but you know what?

739
00:45:03,101 --> 00:45:08,200
Speaker 0: If I spent a lot of money, I could have a really good zoom lens that would be just as good as that lens for most use cases.

740
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:16,820
Speaker 0: And it would save me a lot of hassle and I could take this equivalent photos with way less physical effort and mental effort.

741
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:18,141
Speaker 1: Yeah.

742
00:45:18,722 --> 00:45:29,940
Speaker 1: Well, so the thing there is I think that argument is true, but only in that person's context was like actually trying to be a photographer, like a published professional photographer.

743
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:30,742
Speaker 0: I think you hit on the.

744
00:45:31,183 --> 00:45:33,369
Speaker 0: both perspectives are equally compelling.

745
00:45:33,429 --> 00:45:34,692
Speaker 0: This is an ambivalent situation.

746
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:37,580
Speaker 0: It really depends on your situation, right?

747
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:46,140
Speaker 1: If you're going to sell photos to try to get them in a magazine, to try to make, print a book and sell copies, to put photos in a gallery and sell them, right?

748
00:45:46,501 --> 00:45:51,220
Speaker 1: And it's like, if someone else has taken photos with like the latest, greatest camera, right?

749
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:54,127
Speaker 1: They're ultra high resolution and their autofocus is better.

750
00:45:54,488 --> 00:45:58,820
Speaker 1: And you've got one that's, you know, five years old, three years old, right?

751
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,951
Speaker 1: Let's say you got two sports photographers next to each other at the Olympics.

752
00:46:02,151 --> 00:46:03,235
Speaker 1: Someone's got a brand new one.

753
00:46:03,255 --> 00:46:04,520
Speaker 1: Someone's got the two year old one.

754
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,007
Speaker 1: It's like they're going to have, they're going to get the shot.

755
00:46:07,047 --> 00:46:08,531
Speaker 1: They got more frames per second.

756
00:46:08,591 --> 00:46:10,035
Speaker 1: They got better autofocus.

757
00:46:10,095 --> 00:46:11,860
Speaker 1: They got better megapixels, right?

758
00:46:12,081 --> 00:46:16,840
Speaker 1: They're going to get, they got more likely to get the shot and they're more like, and their shots going to look better in the high res.

759
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:21,498
Speaker 1: And it's going to get into the newspapers and they're going to buy from that photographer and not from you.

760
00:46:21,899 --> 00:46:22,060
Speaker 1: Right?

761
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,012
Speaker 1: So in that sort of situation, it's like, you got to get better.

762
00:46:26,092 --> 00:46:28,460
Speaker 1: You upgrade, get better stuff, right?

763
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:32,487
Speaker 0: I think there's another argument for that side in some cases.

764
00:46:32,527 --> 00:46:40,240
Speaker 0: And that is when the technology you have is old enough to where the workflows around it are materially obsolete.

765
00:46:40,821 --> 00:46:54,720
Speaker 0: and thus learning to use that technology better, which photography is not as much of a thing, but it could be like, especially certain kinds of film photography, but in a lot of other areas, like learning how to use a camcorder from the nineties is not going to teach you anything useful.

766
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,663
Speaker 0: No, you will learn nothing.

767
00:46:57,703 --> 00:46:58,785
Speaker 1: Do it for retro.

768
00:46:58,805 --> 00:46:59,627
Speaker 1: You can do it for fun.

769
00:46:59,647 --> 00:47:07,080
Speaker 1: You can do it for, you might actually want to have a project where like, that's part of the, you know, that's, it's supposed to look like that.

770
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:23,080
Speaker 0: But like learning the pipeline to record a two person podcast, like geek nights on a purely analog setup, that is a nearly worthless skill that is not marketable and will not likely be useful to you at any point in your life compared to the share ease of a modern, pure digital workflow.

771
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:34,900
Speaker 0: But look back at geek nights as an example, when we first started geek nights, the Logitech stick microphone was not the limiting factor on geek nights, us being good at talking continuously for an audience.

772
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,580
Speaker 1: Were we better than that microphone?

773
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:47,040
Speaker 0: No, for at least a year, a while, we were not better than that microphone, but as soon as we got better than that microphone, we rapidly had to evolve our technology.

774
00:47:47,320 --> 00:48:00,780
Speaker 0: But that was, we had a sort of a separate problem that I didn't want to get into, even if like we would have gotten the correct tool for the job, but back then we did not have enough money to afford the best tool for the job.

775
00:48:01,201 --> 00:48:05,367
Speaker 0: So we instead had to make do with the best tool we could afford.

776
00:48:05,387 --> 00:48:06,769
Speaker 0: Remember those Radio Shack mics?

777
00:48:06,849 --> 00:48:13,520
Speaker 0: We recorded geek nights for a while on those things and they sucked and they were a problem, but that was the best we could do.

778
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:21,612
Speaker 0: We still had to upgrade, but we upgraded not to the top of the line, but to like this middle of the road milestone along the way.

779
00:48:21,692 --> 00:48:26,719
Speaker 0: And that is often a good option if you're not a professional or don't have unlimited money.

780
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:36,408
Speaker 0: Of course, you also got to avoid the sword problem of if you have unlimited money, don't buy the $5,000 microphone.

781
00:48:36,448 --> 00:48:38,950
Speaker 0: There is no possible use on earth for that.

782
00:48:39,331 --> 00:48:48,940
Speaker 0: And if you can think of a use, you're either a professional in a industry other than radio and podcasting or you're lying and you're a golden ear audiophile type.

783
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,465
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, there are things you can upgrade to, right?

784
00:48:53,505 --> 00:48:59,792
Speaker 1: If you look at any product category where it's like, yes, there is something better, but it's very expensive.

785
00:48:59,932 --> 00:49:03,096
Speaker 1: And then it's like there's actually something that's even more expensive.

786
00:49:03,176 --> 00:49:04,278
Speaker 1: that's not actually better.

787
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,240
Speaker 1: It's just there to take money from people.

788
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:06,761
Speaker 1: Right.

789
00:49:07,202 --> 00:49:14,836
Speaker 1: It's like if you go to the store with a fancy jewelry and look at the watches and like for some reason you want a mechanical jewelry watch that cost a shit ton of money.

790
00:49:14,876 --> 00:49:15,076
Speaker 1: Right.

791
00:49:15,136 --> 00:49:17,040
Speaker 1: It's like they have them.

792
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,341
Speaker 1: You know, there's Rolex.

793
00:49:18,401 --> 00:49:22,948
Speaker 1: is that cost, you know, tens, maybe even hundreds of thousands of dollars, maybe even millions.

794
00:49:22,968 --> 00:49:23,408
Speaker 1: Who knows?

795
00:49:23,529 --> 00:49:23,769
Speaker 1: Right.

796
00:49:24,109 --> 00:49:31,560
Speaker 1: But it's like there are also like, you know, other luxury watch brands right that are out there that aren't Rolex or maybe they're cheaper Rolex.

797
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:35,083
Speaker 1: It's like and it's like, are they going to be really worse?

798
00:49:35,483 --> 00:49:35,804
Speaker 1: Right.

799
00:49:37,105 --> 00:49:38,426
Speaker 1: You know, probably not.

800
00:49:39,007 --> 00:49:54,220
Speaker 0: And that's where you can't upgrade too high on the cost path, regardless of how much money you have, until you have enough understanding of the thing you're buying to understand where is the point beyond which it's diminishing returns and stealing money from foolish rich people.

801
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:55,380
Speaker 1: Right.

802
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:55,701
Speaker 1: Exactly.

803
00:49:55,721 --> 00:49:58,983
Speaker 1: Like if I had like if I won the lottery.

804
00:49:59,283 --> 00:49:59,583
Speaker 1: Right.

805
00:49:59,904 --> 00:50:02,566
Speaker 1: And I, you know, which is like, you know, I'm basically my bicycle.

806
00:50:02,586 --> 00:50:04,307
Speaker 1: I have no reason to upgrade it whatsoever.

807
00:50:05,388 --> 00:50:10,952
Speaker 1: But like, you know, it's I have nothing to change on it, like no complaints whatsoever, except that the change is broke.

808
00:50:10,992 --> 00:50:11,172
Speaker 1: Right.

809
00:50:11,212 --> 00:50:12,192
Speaker 1: Besides that.

810
00:50:12,893 --> 00:50:13,113
Speaker 1: Right.

811
00:50:13,393 --> 00:50:13,714
Speaker 1: It's like.

812
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:18,697
Speaker 1: but if I were to go and like I got a huge pile of money, it's like, why not buy a new bike?

813
00:50:18,777 --> 00:50:18,997
Speaker 1: Right.

814
00:50:19,418 --> 00:50:22,060
Speaker 1: It's like they sell twenty thousand dollar bikes.

815
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:22,640
Speaker 1: Thirty thousand.

816
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:24,151
Speaker 0: I've written the 20 ish.

817
00:50:24,571 --> 00:50:26,212
Speaker 0: Actually, an eighteen thousand dollar bike once.

818
00:50:26,352 --> 00:50:32,776
Speaker 0: And was it ten thousand dollars better than the eight thousand dollar mountain bike I rode?

819
00:50:32,976 --> 00:50:33,216
Speaker 0: No.

820
00:50:33,716 --> 00:50:34,537
Speaker 0: But was it better?

821
00:50:34,557 --> 00:50:35,277
Speaker 0: Yeah.

822
00:50:35,817 --> 00:50:39,419
Speaker 0: But I'm not a professional mountain biker running right here.

823
00:50:39,459 --> 00:50:39,659
Speaker 0: Money.

824
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:39,779
Speaker 0: Right.

825
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,201
Speaker 1: So I like your trek domain.

826
00:50:42,541 --> 00:50:42,902
Speaker 1: Right.

827
00:50:42,982 --> 00:50:45,623
Speaker 1: I guess sort by price high to low.

828
00:50:46,124 --> 00:50:46,384
Speaker 1: Right.

829
00:50:46,404 --> 00:50:46,784
Speaker 1: So they have the.

830
00:50:47,365 --> 00:50:50,707
Speaker 1: OK, so they have the trek domain SLR nine access.

831
00:50:50,767 --> 00:50:53,509
Speaker 1: Gen four is thirteen thousand dollars.

832
00:50:53,629 --> 00:50:53,909
Speaker 1: Right.

833
00:50:53,989 --> 00:50:58,152
Speaker 1: It's like even if I won the lottery, I probably would not choose that one.

834
00:50:58,413 --> 00:50:58,713
Speaker 1: Right.

835
00:50:59,113 --> 00:51:06,538
Speaker 1: I might choose, you know, something like, I don't know, the domain SL seven Gen four for sixty eight hundred dollars.

836
00:51:06,678 --> 00:51:06,999
Speaker 1: Right.

837
00:51:07,059 --> 00:51:07,319
Speaker 1: It's like.

838
00:51:07,339 --> 00:51:09,060
Speaker 1: that's much much more reasonable.

839
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,342
Speaker 1: And am I better than that bike?

840
00:51:11,642 --> 00:51:11,922
Speaker 1: Right.

841
00:51:12,262 --> 00:51:12,522
Speaker 1: Yeah.

842
00:51:12,542 --> 00:51:18,746
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, I'm not you know, I just choose the bike that I'm the cheapest bike that I am not better than.

843
00:51:18,766 --> 00:51:19,347
Speaker 1: Right.

844
00:51:19,407 --> 00:51:22,249
Speaker 1: Is where I would go even if money was no object.

845
00:51:22,349 --> 00:51:22,469
Speaker 1: Right.

846
00:51:22,489 --> 00:51:23,670
Speaker 1: They're just handing out free bikes.

847
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:24,831
Speaker 1: Pick any model you want.

848
00:51:25,131 --> 00:51:27,632
Speaker 1: I still wouldn't pick the thirteen thousand dollar.

849
00:51:27,652 --> 00:51:28,033
Speaker 1: Right.

850
00:51:28,973 --> 00:51:33,797
Speaker 0: Now, some cases you do get the absolute best thing.

851
00:51:34,077 --> 00:51:38,960
Speaker 1: And that's usually in product categories where no one's trying to milk the high end.

852
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,642
Speaker 0: So, for example, I had water filters.

853
00:51:41,702 --> 00:51:42,703
Speaker 0: No, we hike and camp a lot.

854
00:51:42,723 --> 00:51:48,768
Speaker 0: Me and Emily and one don't fuck around with drinking water you found outside.

855
00:51:48,888 --> 00:51:50,349
Speaker 0: That's just a general rule of life.

856
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:51,550
Speaker 0: Yes.

857
00:51:51,750 --> 00:52:03,160
Speaker 1: So no matter where I guess, if if it's like a natural fucking spring or like you took some glacier and you melted it or something like I mean, natural springs, that's still going to test like you did, but obviously.

858
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:15,711
Speaker 0: But so I there are perfectly like effective ways to filter water that are pretty cheap, but they either make the water taste like ass, like it tastes like bleach.

859
00:52:15,731 --> 00:52:22,277
Speaker 0: You just drinking bleach or they're not ninety nine point nine nine nine nine percent effective.

860
00:52:22,297 --> 00:52:25,080
Speaker 0: They're only like ninety nine percent effective.

861
00:52:25,621 --> 00:52:38,560
Speaker 0: So, of course, I bought the three hundred dollar like military grade for real filter because I'm not going to fuck around with my own personal safety, especially drinking water within one hundred miles of New York City out in the woods.

862
00:52:41,581 --> 00:52:52,880
Speaker 0: But I did upgrade from the life straw because while the life straw is also super effective, it you cannot get enough water through that quickly if you are thirsty, let alone if you're going to cook with water.

863
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:59,080
Speaker 0: Like I need to be able to pump like a couple of gallons of clean water quickly to then go cook with out in the woods.

864
00:53:00,881 --> 00:53:01,604
Speaker 0: So let's see.

865
00:53:01,785 --> 00:53:05,720
Speaker 0: I guess we could talk about a few examples like right now, TVs are actually a really good topic.

866
00:53:06,821 --> 00:53:13,300
Speaker 0: I have a TV that I should replace one because it's dying, but it's been dying for a couple of years now.

867
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:22,060
Speaker 0: But it's at the point where the brightness is at max and it's slowly dimming beyond the point where I could probably repair it and replace just the backlights.

868
00:53:22,261 --> 00:53:23,283
Speaker 1: And you'll be all good.

869
00:53:23,464 --> 00:53:24,367
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's also.

870
00:53:24,387 --> 00:53:29,040
Speaker 1: the problem is, is that TVs are so cheap now, especially if you weren't getting an OLED.

871
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:37,560
Speaker 1: Like if you went for like, you know, like one of those like high sense and like and we're like one of those QLEDs and like not the highest end model for like the second best model.

872
00:53:38,061 --> 00:53:46,440
Speaker 1: It's like we're talking hundreds of dollars right now to get a new TV that would be way better, at least visually than your TV when it was new.

873
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:50,660
Speaker 1: So it's like, and I guess how much is it going to cost to repair the backlights?

874
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:52,631
Speaker 1: Maybe also hundreds.

875
00:53:52,792 --> 00:53:53,559
Speaker 1: So why would you do that?

876
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:54,241
Speaker 0: Exactly.

877
00:53:54,301 --> 00:54:00,540
Speaker 0: But I had been I'd been wanting to upgrade my TV to a 4K TV because, well, there aren't a lot of streaming things to use that.

878
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,440
Speaker 1: How much 4K content is available to you?

879
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:05,299
Speaker 0: Games in the living room, HDPC, stuff like that.

880
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:15,440
Speaker 0: Like I have use cases, but the reason I have not upgraded is that I have a well, until very recently, now that the TV is toward its death.

881
00:54:16,141 --> 00:54:20,060
Speaker 0: I had a perfectly good TV that covered 90 percent of everything I cared about.

882
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:25,200
Speaker 0: That slight bump in quality was not worth the extra cost when it still worked.

883
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,125
Speaker 0: And it was not worth the externality of.

884
00:54:27,547 --> 00:54:31,720
Speaker 0: I'm replacing something that theoretically I could keep using, bad for the environment.

885
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:41,960
Speaker 0: But also by waiting a couple more years instead of upgrading when I originally wanted to, two more generations of OLED TVs have come out.

886
00:54:42,141 --> 00:54:46,339
Speaker 0: I can get a TV that is way better than the one I could have gotten a few years ago.

887
00:54:47,081 --> 00:54:49,340
Speaker 1: And did you suffer really for those two years?

888
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:55,240
Speaker 1: Were you like, you know, now the only time I suffered the only the opportunity cost of the past two years, the shitty.

889
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:55,501
Speaker 1: Yeah.

890
00:54:55,521 --> 00:54:56,878
Speaker 0: So you know what the opportunity cost was?

891
00:54:59,062 --> 00:55:02,660
Speaker 0: A couple of shows we watched were too dark, but wasn't that big a deal.

892
00:55:03,201 --> 00:55:10,380
Speaker 0: And playing Disco Elysium together on the couch, not ideal because of the 1080p text instead of 4K text.

893
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:11,353
Speaker 1: But you didn't die.

894
00:55:11,373 --> 00:55:11,740
Speaker 1: You live.

895
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:12,343
Speaker 1: Yeah, it wasn't.

896
00:55:12,363 --> 00:55:16,360
Speaker 0: It was it degraded the experience, but to a degree that was not material.

897
00:55:17,042 --> 00:55:17,224
Speaker 1: Yeah.

898
00:55:17,446 --> 00:55:19,080
Speaker 1: I mean, if you need more brightness, right.

899
00:55:19,321 --> 00:55:21,000
Speaker 1: The OLED TVs, right, which obviously.

900
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,626
Speaker 0: Oh, no, I only need more brightness.

901
00:55:22,666 --> 00:55:25,400
Speaker 0: compared to this TV is like dimming rapidly.

902
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:26,101
Speaker 0: Right.

903
00:55:26,181 --> 00:55:26,503
Speaker 1: Yeah.

904
00:55:27,045 --> 00:55:30,640
Speaker 1: I mean, especially since, you know, you have that new building that went up blocking all the sunlight.

905
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,880
Speaker 1: You're probably you know, the OLED is the good choice, right?

906
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,965
Speaker 1: You usually need the LCD.

907
00:55:36,025 --> 00:55:41,940
Speaker 1: these days if you want to, A, save money or B, you want to like overpower some other lights because you're watching in a bright.

908
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:42,704
Speaker 1: Yeah.

909
00:55:42,744 --> 00:55:44,220
Speaker 0: The OLED is the use case.

910
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:45,258
Speaker 1: Your apartment is now very dark.

911
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:50,280
Speaker 0: But to talk about a very similar situation, remember we were in RIT and one day my computer stopped working.

912
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:57,460
Speaker 0: And that was, you know, being a nerd at RIT, that is that is that is the second worst possible thing that can happen to you.

913
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:03,120
Speaker 0: The worst being like getting cancer or something like my computer breaking was existential.

914
00:56:03,261 --> 00:56:05,280
Speaker 0: It was the capacitor problem I had.

915
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:05,831
Speaker 1: Oh, right.

916
00:56:05,851 --> 00:56:06,180
Speaker 1: That one.

917
00:56:06,601 --> 00:56:06,701
Speaker 0: Yep.

918
00:56:06,721 --> 00:56:10,654
Speaker 0: So I had a motherboard and it had an AMD K7-800 in it.

919
00:56:12,941 --> 00:56:21,160
Speaker 0: So when it died, my options were replace it or use this as an opportunity to upgrade.

920
00:56:21,981 --> 00:56:33,760
Speaker 0: And that was actually a difficult decision, because on one hand, I could buy a new motherboard, put the same CPU I had into that motherboard and probably keep going, because it was very unlikely that CPU was damaged.

921
00:56:34,081 --> 00:56:35,300
Speaker 0: Only the motherboard was damaged.

922
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:45,540
Speaker 0: However, A, the industry had just shifted again from CPUs and sockets, which in retrospect didn't last that long, to slots again.

923
00:56:46,122 --> 00:56:51,620
Speaker 0: And when the slots happen, that was clearly going to be the future of CPUs basically forever after that point.

924
00:56:52,141 --> 00:57:06,501
Speaker 0: So if I got a slot instead of a socket, I would have to also upgrade the CPU, but I could get a gigahertz CPU, which going from 800 megahertz to a gigahertz in the year 2002.

925
00:57:06,501 --> 00:57:07,160
Speaker 1: That's a huge improvement.

926
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:09,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, that is a significant material improvement.

927
00:57:10,261 --> 00:57:21,300
Speaker 0: And that was an era where you could upgrade CPUs one to one point five times before the socket changed and the motherboards were incompatible.

928
00:57:21,382 --> 00:57:22,240
Speaker 0: That is not the case now.

929
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,219
Speaker 1: Now the socket changes like, you know, a lot.

930
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:28,700
Speaker 0: So like nowadays, I would pretty much say if your motherboard dies, replace that and the CPU.

931
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:32,000
Speaker 0: If the CPU dies, replace the mother, like replace the whole fucking thing.

932
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:35,080
Speaker 0: Just build a new computer, use your existing non-core components.

933
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:36,060
Speaker 1: Save your hard drives.

934
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:36,855
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's about it.

935
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:44,760
Speaker 0: But in the year 2002, it was materially better to use the opportunity to upgrade.

936
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:50,520
Speaker 0: The incremental cost difference actually gave me a computer that lasted a lot longer.

937
00:57:50,982 --> 00:57:53,920
Speaker 0: It saved me money in the long run and gave me a better experience.

938
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:59,099
Speaker 0: I did have to convince my dad to give me a few hundred bucks because I couldn't afford it, but it all worked out.

939
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:09,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, that's the thing is when the upgrade is not replacing an entire object, right, but is replacing a part of a whole.

940
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:10,402
Speaker 1: Right.

941
00:58:10,806 --> 00:58:11,979
Speaker 1: It's like that.

942
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:21,540
Speaker 1: And if it can extend the life span or the useful lifespan of the larger, more expensive object, you might actually be saving money by upgrading.

943
00:58:21,961 --> 00:58:22,181
Speaker 1: Right.

944
00:58:22,622 --> 00:58:31,980
Speaker 1: Even if it's something extreme, like a new engine in the car, there are times when, you know, as expensive as that is, where that could be better than new car.

945
00:58:32,281 --> 00:58:32,501
Speaker 1: Right.

946
00:58:32,581 --> 00:58:41,020
Speaker 1: Maybe you maybe you found the engine and like at the junkyard from a similar car that got hit and then you were able, you know, a guy who swapped it in.

947
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:41,842
Speaker 1: Right.

948
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:43,971
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, and that was they crashed.

949
00:58:43,991 --> 00:58:46,160
Speaker 1: their brand new car engine was hardly used.

950
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,840
Speaker 1: It's like there are situations you can get away with in life.

951
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:49,641
Speaker 1: If you're resourceful.

952
00:58:49,661 --> 00:59:00,180
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, when the CD player in the radio of my 1998 Pontiac Sunfire that barely ran broke, even replacing it was not worth it.

953
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:13,280
Speaker 0: So I just wired up my iPod mini or micro, whatever the small iPod was, into the car with a bootleg adapter and made it work and just made do.

954
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:23,040
Speaker 0: I didn't upgrade or replace because if I had bought a nice radio or a CD switcher or something to put in that car, that thing probably would have been worth more than the whole car.

955
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,142
Speaker 1: Probably, yeah.

956
00:59:25,885 --> 00:59:30,560
Speaker 0: You remember that car toward the end of its life, it was decrepit is the word.

957
00:59:33,982 --> 00:59:36,680
Speaker 1: So, yeah, I do see a lot of people out there.

958
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:36,941
Speaker 1: Right.

959
00:59:36,981 --> 00:59:43,200
Speaker 1: It's common in all fields of nerdery and geekery who have the gear acquisition syndrome or the upgrade fever.

960
00:59:43,342 --> 00:59:43,564
Speaker 1: Right.

961
00:59:43,604 --> 00:59:45,000
Speaker 1: It's like new Nvidia car.

962
00:59:45,141 --> 00:59:46,840
Speaker 1: They just keep upgrading it all the time.

963
00:59:47,022 --> 00:59:47,243
Speaker 1: Right.

964
00:59:47,324 --> 00:59:49,200
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, new cameras.

965
00:59:49,383 --> 00:59:50,579
Speaker 1: They get the new ones all the time.

966
00:59:50,862 --> 00:59:52,299
Speaker 1: TV is new TV every year.

967
00:59:52,681 --> 00:59:52,882
Speaker 1: Yeah.

968
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:57,799
Speaker 0: It's like I have a computer professional for whom video gaming is a primary hobby who does VR.

969
00:59:58,201 --> 00:59:58,763
Speaker 0: And you know what?

970
00:59:59,084 --> 01:00:02,700
Speaker 0: I still have a 1080 in my computer and I do.

971
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:04,160
Speaker 0: And that is in there on purpose.

972
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,960
Speaker 0: So think about that if you're about to buy a 4080.

973
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:08,060
Speaker 1: Right.

974
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:08,361
Speaker 1: It's like.

975
01:00:08,381 --> 01:00:18,200
Speaker 1: is it, you know, if you went into someone's house who just upgraded like the 2080 or the 3080 to a 4080 and you switched it back to the 3080.

976
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:18,461
Speaker 1: Right.

977
01:00:18,922 --> 01:00:23,712
Speaker 1: And you just if they never looked at any benchmarks or they never looked at it, they even know.

978
01:00:24,333 --> 01:00:27,500
Speaker 1: if they never looked at their frame rate or anything, would they know?

979
01:00:27,783 --> 01:00:28,553
Speaker 1: They wouldn't know.

980
01:00:28,573 --> 01:00:28,897
Speaker 1: Right.

981
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:30,498
Speaker 1: There's no way they would know.

982
01:00:30,761 --> 01:00:30,942
Speaker 1: Right.

983
01:00:30,982 --> 01:00:35,120
Speaker 1: It's still running a 3080, still runs every game at max settings, full frames.

984
01:00:35,262 --> 01:00:36,460
Speaker 1: And so it is a 4080.

985
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:36,721
Speaker 1: Right.

986
01:00:37,042 --> 01:00:45,260
Speaker 1: And like if unless they do something like try to render some ridiculous video or mine bitcoins or something stupid like that.

987
01:00:45,401 --> 01:00:45,562
Speaker 1: Right.

988
01:00:45,623 --> 01:00:47,217
Speaker 1: It's like they will not know.

989
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:54,940
Speaker 0: But meanwhile, remember, but when I got I upgraded to 4K monitors a while before you did.

990
01:00:55,382 --> 01:00:57,755
Speaker 0: You came over one day back when we were playing auto chess.

991
01:00:57,795 --> 01:00:58,800
Speaker 0: that lasted a hot minute.

992
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:02,140
Speaker 0: And I remember you sat down and you were like, why?

993
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:05,360
Speaker 0: You said out loud, wow, auto chess looks great.

994
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:06,639
Speaker 0: Like, what are your settings?

995
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:08,395
Speaker 0: That was just like, that's just 4K.

996
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:10,920
Speaker 0: It's not even max settings.

997
01:01:11,264 --> 01:01:11,692
Speaker 0: That's just 4K.

998
01:01:12,522 --> 01:01:14,620
Speaker 0: And you basically were like, well, fuck.

999
01:01:14,902 --> 01:01:17,399
Speaker 0: And you upgraded to 4K not too long after that.

1000
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:18,944
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1001
01:01:19,004 --> 01:01:20,400
Speaker 1: I don't think it was around then.

1002
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:21,739
Speaker 1: When did I buy these monitors?

1003
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:24,660
Speaker 0: Because I could check it quite a while, actually.

1004
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:30,160
Speaker 0: And meanwhile, our house, we have three of the same Dell 4K monitor between me and Emily.

1005
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,540
Speaker 1: I actually have two different monitors.

1006
01:01:31,661 --> 01:01:32,432
Speaker 1: I got a Dell one.

1007
01:01:32,757 --> 01:01:32,960
Speaker 1: Right.

1008
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:33,769
Speaker 1: That's only 60 hertz.

1009
01:01:34,962 --> 01:01:35,224
Speaker 1: Right.

1010
01:01:35,265 --> 01:01:37,200
Speaker 1: But has really good color replicate.

1011
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:37,582
Speaker 1: Right.

1012
01:01:37,662 --> 01:01:40,700
Speaker 1: And then I have a LG one that the color is meh.

1013
01:01:40,901 --> 01:01:41,667
Speaker 1: It's a little bit off.

1014
01:01:41,728 --> 01:01:43,079
Speaker 1: It's not bad, but it's not great.

1015
01:01:43,723 --> 01:01:44,792
Speaker 1: But it goes to 144 hertz.

1016
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:48,997
Speaker 1: The thing is, my my GPU doesn't support 144 hertz.

1017
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:50,920
Speaker 1: It only supports like 92.

1018
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:55,960
Speaker 0: I mean, I lock all my monitors at 60 because my 1080 is that 60 is what you're getting.

1019
01:01:57,140 --> 01:01:57,240
Speaker 1: Right.

1020
01:01:57,361 --> 01:02:01,280
Speaker 1: But if I you know, that is one reason to get a new video card is to get more hertz.

1021
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,660
Speaker 1: But actually, what do I do that needs more hertz?

1022
01:02:04,382 --> 01:02:04,783
Speaker 0: Yup.

1023
01:02:05,004 --> 01:02:05,626
Speaker 0: Are you playing?

1024
01:02:05,807 --> 01:02:09,280
Speaker 0: are you playing competitive FPS's for real and seriously?

1025
01:02:10,521 --> 01:02:10,822
Speaker 1: Right.

1026
01:02:10,902 --> 01:02:15,460
Speaker 1: It's like, do I actually need those extra hertz, you know, the extra refresh rate?

1027
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,180
Speaker 1: It's like I will eventually.

1028
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:17,983
Speaker 0: But meanwhile, look at me.

1029
01:02:18,204 --> 01:02:22,160
Speaker 0: I'm playing competitive FPS is seriously with intent to be good at them.

1030
01:02:22,704 --> 01:02:25,323
Speaker 0: And I'm still sticking around at 60.

1031
01:02:25,323 --> 01:02:27,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, yeah, that's fine.

1032
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:32,600
Speaker 0: Because I am not I mean, I'm still upper silver logo like I am not better than my refresh rate at Overwatch.

1033
01:02:33,081 --> 01:02:36,440
Speaker 1: So so the TLD of upgrading is don't be wasteful.

1034
01:02:36,901 --> 01:02:37,082
Speaker 1: Right.

1035
01:02:37,102 --> 01:02:41,620
Speaker 1: With your money or with the environment or with things that still work and are perfectly serviceable.

1036
01:02:42,101 --> 01:02:42,382
Speaker 1: Right.

1037
01:02:43,205 --> 01:02:50,312
Speaker 1: Don't upgrade fruitlessly if there's no reason for it, if it's not actually going to result in an improvement of something meaningful,

1038
01:02:50,373 --> 01:02:50,654
Speaker 0: I think

1039
01:02:50,734 --> 01:02:51,577
Speaker 1: in your life, most

1040
01:02:51,678 --> 01:03:07,262
Speaker 0: importantly, lead your life in terms of the acquisition of things from the perspective of useful things from the perspective of is there a problem, a difficulty, a hole in my life that this will fill in some material?

1041
01:03:07,322 --> 01:03:10,795
Speaker 1: I have a goal I'm trying to achieve and the tools are.

1042
01:03:10,835 --> 01:03:15,600
Speaker 1: the reason that I am not achieving the goal is that tools are inadequate or is it or not?

1043
01:03:16,041 --> 01:03:23,640
Speaker 0: Because never forget, when I bought my skis, when I was first learning how to ski again and I was like, why are those what's what's better about those skis?

1044
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:29,459
Speaker 0: And the guy was like, there's several hundred dollars more and they're blue and you clearly don't know the difference between them.

1045
01:03:29,762 --> 01:03:31,480
Speaker 0: So you should buy these skis.

1046
01:03:31,601 --> 01:03:33,920
Speaker 0: And he kept pointing at the cheapest skis they sold.

1047
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:41,899
Speaker 1: It was a very wise a person whose job it is to sell skis telling you to buy the cheaper one so that you know that that's the store that you should go back to.

1048
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:52,640
Speaker 0: Guess where I went back to buy expensive skis like eight years later when I knew what the fuck I was doing and I went in and I was like, I know exactly why those skis are better in detail.

1049
01:03:53,001 --> 01:03:54,179
Speaker 0: And the same guy was there.

1050
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:57,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was the ski house upstate by Fishkill.

1051
01:03:58,662 --> 01:03:59,300
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that one.

1052
01:04:04,183 --> 01:04:06,300

Speaker 0: So, yeah, Geek Nights is just plugging along mostly like usual.

1061
01:04:57,780 --> 01:04:59,700
Speaker 0: And I got nothing.

1062
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:00,624
Speaker 0: I'm just really hungry.

1063
01:05:01,046 --> 01:05:03,459
Speaker 0: So anyway, here's.

1064
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:05,678
Speaker 0: There's the Oasis.

1065
01:05:06,661 --> 01:05:10,279
Speaker 0: It's not much, but it's a safe haven from soul fangs in the husks.

1066
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:11,704
Speaker 1: How does it keep them out?

1067
01:05:12,306 --> 01:05:15,500
Speaker 0: Surrounded by obelisks that create a circle of protection.

1068
01:05:16,023 --> 01:05:17,960
Speaker 1: It's a magical barrier around the Oasis.

1069
01:05:19,003 --> 01:05:20,839
Speaker 0: Anyway, here's the Wonderwall.

1070
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:29,579
Speaker 0: Today, day, day, day, day, day, day, day, day, day, day.

1071
01:05:30,961 --> 01:05:40,360
Speaker 0: By now, now, now, now, now, now, now, I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do.

1072
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:42,081
Speaker 0: Doo doo doo doo doo.
