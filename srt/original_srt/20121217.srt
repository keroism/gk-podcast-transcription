1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:15,534
Speaker 1: It's Monday, December 17th, 2012.

2
00:00:15,534 --> 00:00:16,195
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:16,596 --> 00:00:17,117
Speaker 0: I'm Sky.

4
00:00:17,157 --> 00:00:18,279
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:22,931
Speaker 1: Tonight we're talking about internet governance, which is not as boring as it should be.

6
00:00:22,951 --> 00:00:28,244
Speaker 0: That sums up the whole goddamn thing right there, isn't it?

7
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:35,180
Speaker 0: I have not heard that summed up more eloquently.

8
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:38,863
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

9
00:00:39,886 --> 00:00:44,924
Speaker 1: So it's been a long time since my job was to go into data centers and fuck with physical things.

10
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:46,070
Speaker 0: Did you go to a data center?

11
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:46,634
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

12
00:00:46,654 --> 00:00:48,001
Speaker 0: You went into your closet in your office?

13
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:57,814
Speaker 1: So in every company, even if you have data centers with all your stuff hosted in cloud and whatever, you usually have a few servers in your local office.

14
00:00:57,854 --> 00:01:03,479
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, if you're a big enough company to have an office and everyone has a computer- You at least have a switch.

15
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:09,062
Speaker 0: You at least have a big ass switch and you have a closet where Verizon runs in the tea, whatever you got.

16
00:01:09,082 --> 00:01:09,142
Speaker 0: Yep.

17
00:01:09,384 --> 00:01:12,336
Speaker 1: And then you probably have like- So that's already two boxes.

18
00:01:12,356 --> 00:01:19,335
Speaker 1: You probably have like a caching server for like private shares or DNS or whatever.

19
00:01:19,355 --> 00:01:23,127
Speaker 1: So you're going to have at least three or four servers in your local place.

20
00:01:23,147 --> 00:01:25,055
Speaker 0: You probably want a UPS in there too.

21
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:31,659
Speaker 1: Now in New York City, unless you're in a nice building, usually buildings do not have really places for that.

22
00:01:31,679 --> 00:01:33,684
Speaker 0: No, it's an old building.

23
00:01:33,784 --> 00:01:35,309
Speaker 0: There's just a closet in your office.

24
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,433
Speaker 0: that was a closet.

25
00:01:36,453 --> 00:01:42,440
Speaker 1: Other companies I've worked at, we at least had the blessing of the building, but our building kind of sucks.

26
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,006
Speaker 1: And I hate where our building is.

27
00:01:45,026 --> 00:01:50,448
Speaker 1: But anyway, there's a closet and it was set up long before I got to the company and I kind of ignored it.

28
00:01:50,508 --> 00:01:51,914
Speaker 1: I'm not the system administrator.

29
00:01:52,095 --> 00:01:53,942
Speaker 1: I do different things.

30
00:01:54,243 --> 00:01:55,327
Speaker 1: So I just let it be.

31
00:01:55,347 --> 00:01:56,109
Speaker 1: I ignore it.

32
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,152
Speaker 0: Until it stopped working.

33
00:01:57,493 --> 00:02:01,892
Speaker 1: So yeah, I had to deal with it because I came in one day and I'm like, "The fuck is that burning

34
00:02:01,952 --> 00:02:02,194
Speaker 1: smell?".

35
00:02:02,234 --> 00:02:06,620
Speaker 1: And I go in and the outlet that connects one of the air conditioning units in there is on fire.

36
00:02:07,121 --> 00:02:07,886
Speaker 0: Literally a fire?

37
00:02:07,906 --> 00:02:09,940
Speaker 0: Did you need a fire extinguisher?

38
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:14,699
Speaker 1: It was smoking and the fire had apparently happened and then gone out and ruined it.

39
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,960
Speaker 1: So I unplugged the thing with like a piece of metal, like knock it out of the wall.

40
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,125
Speaker 0: Well, you're an expert at that.

41
00:02:20,426 --> 00:02:22,254
Speaker 0: Yeah.

42
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:26,009
Speaker 1: Someone can find the relevant geek nights episode about that.

43
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,133
Speaker 1: And then I'm like, "Oh

44
00:02:27,193 --> 00:02:27,494
Speaker 1: fuck.".

45
00:02:27,534 --> 00:02:30,465
Speaker 1: So we get the new air conditioning unit to stick in the room.

46
00:02:30,505 --> 00:02:30,987
Speaker 1: There were two.

47
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:37,080
Speaker 1: And in the course of this, I kind of look around the room and I realized that whoever set it up had no idea what they were doing.

48
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:38,621
Speaker 0: Yeah.

49
00:02:38,821 --> 00:02:40,388
Speaker 0: Usually that's the way it goes.

50
00:02:40,529 --> 00:02:42,718
Speaker 1: Now I know HVAC okay as in.

51
00:02:42,758 --> 00:02:45,591
Speaker 1: I know like the high level stuff, but I don't know the exact details.

52
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:49,849
Speaker 1: Like what pressure differential, all that kind of like low level stuff.

53
00:02:50,432 --> 00:02:53,224
Speaker 1: So I look at the room and I'm like, "Something's not right

54
00:02:53,285 --> 00:02:53,485
Speaker 1: here.".

55
00:02:53,927 --> 00:02:55,957
Speaker 1: So I do a little Google in to confirm my suspicions.

56
00:02:56,399 --> 00:03:00,700
Speaker 1: And sure enough, it's those standalone units, like what our friend Alex had in his apartment, right?

57
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,660
Speaker 1: What you use to air condition a room that's basically sealed.

58
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,649
Speaker 0: Did the hose not go outside the building?

59
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,056
Speaker 1: So there are two kinds.

60
00:03:07,076 --> 00:03:09,226
Speaker 1: Well, no, and it still doesn't, but that's not.

61
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:11,295
Speaker 1: So there's two different kinds of those.

62
00:03:11,576 --> 00:03:16,774
Speaker 1: There's kinds that basically intake air from the room and then exhaust hot air out.

63
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,740
Speaker 1: They cause negative pressure.

64
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:20,546
Speaker 1: They're basically terrible.

65
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:23,100
Speaker 1: You should never use a unit like that unless you really know why.

66
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,953
Speaker 0: You want the kind that takes air in from the outside, cools it and blows it into the room.

67
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:30,120
Speaker 1: No, you don't want that either.

68
00:03:31,484 --> 00:03:35,480
Speaker 0: All the heat from the cooling machine, the compressor goes outside the building.

69
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,352
Speaker 1: You don't want that either.

70
00:03:36,372 --> 00:03:36,413
Speaker 1: No?

71
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:37,360
Speaker 1: No.

72
00:03:37,381 --> 00:03:39,280
Speaker 0: Isn't that how a regular-ass air conditioner works?

73
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,605
Speaker 0: No.

74
00:03:40,745 --> 00:03:40,986
Speaker 0: Wow.

75
00:03:41,027 --> 00:03:41,749
Speaker 1: I guess a lot of people.

76
00:03:42,031 --> 00:03:44,099
Speaker 0: So a regular-ass air conditioner, right?

77
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,800
Speaker 0: There's a compressor, just like your refrigerator.

78
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:49,641
Speaker 1: Scott, the one that you put in your window when we lived in the geek house in Beacon, right?

79
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:50,464
Speaker 1: Same one I had.

80
00:03:51,027 --> 00:04:01,159
Speaker 1: The way it worked is it took air from in your room, circled it over a compressor, sorry, a condenser, and then circulated back into the room.

81
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,868
Speaker 0: But all the heat goes out the outside.

82
00:04:03,988 --> 00:04:13,038
Speaker 1: Independently, it took air from the outside, ran it over the compressor where the hot side was, and then exhausted it back outside.

83
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:17,031
Speaker 1: It used the outside air to just cool down the hot end of the heat pump.

84
00:04:17,994 --> 00:04:20,664
Speaker 1: So there's no actual air exchange with the outside.

85
00:04:20,684 --> 00:04:23,999
Speaker 1: For a small unit like that, that would actually be really inefficient.

86
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:24,622
Speaker 1: Because think about it.

87
00:04:24,742 --> 00:04:30,928
Speaker 1: Either you're sucking hot air in, way hotter than the air already in your room, cooling it, and then pumping it in.

88
00:04:30,968 --> 00:04:33,941
Speaker 1: And if you do that, now you've got a positive pressure in your room.

89
00:04:33,961 --> 00:04:35,606
Speaker 1: So what are you going to do?

90
00:04:35,646 --> 00:04:38,275
Speaker 1: Pump your nicely new cold air back outside?

91
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:40,664
Speaker 1: Pump it into the rest of the house?

92
00:04:40,724 --> 00:04:42,071
Speaker 0: I like it to be high pressure though.

93
00:04:42,091 --> 00:04:45,284
Speaker 0: Especially if it can like squish me against the floor.

94
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,330
Speaker 0: Get the bends going in my room.

95
00:04:49,096 --> 00:04:51,224
Speaker 1: So independently, so there's all these different ways to do it.

96
00:04:51,264 --> 00:04:52,470
Speaker 0: Keep the dust out of my room too.

97
00:04:52,491 --> 00:04:59,623
Speaker 1: Basically, one of those units that you like put in a room that has the two hoses coming out of it, one of the hoses sucks air in, one sucks out.

98
00:04:59,743 --> 00:05:04,360
Speaker 1: It's basically as though where those two hoses go is the equivalent of outside.

99
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,192
Speaker 0: Well, usually they have one hose that goes outside.

100
00:05:07,292 --> 00:05:08,237
Speaker 1: Usually they have two.

101
00:05:08,378 --> 00:05:17,910
Speaker 1: The ones that only have one hose either inside of that actually have two hoses or they're a negative pressure system, which has a whole different set of requirements.

102
00:05:19,635 --> 00:05:36,576
Speaker 1: So anyway, I knew all this already, but I did a little bit of Googling to confirm the best practices for air conditioning in a sealed room, which as I've mentioned on geek nights, if you Google for that, you find pretty much nothing but idiots trying to grow marijuana in their houses, which is kind of funny.

103
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:47,736
Speaker 1: But anyway, so I realized that what was going on, because the old SA left this node on the door that was basically like never closed the door to this room for any reason ever.

104
00:05:47,816 --> 00:05:48,560
Speaker 0: Did you close the door?

105
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,753
Speaker 1: So one time an intern closed the door and the room got like a hundred degrees.

106
00:05:52,773 --> 00:05:53,275
Speaker 1: Awesome.

107
00:05:53,797 --> 00:05:55,483
Speaker 1: So I look, I'm like, wait a minute.

108
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:56,890
Speaker 1: Why is that sign there?

109
00:05:56,911 --> 00:06:01,188
Speaker 1: Basically what they had done is they had taken two standalone air conditioners with the two hoses.

110
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:11,160
Speaker 1: They had taken the hot end hoses and piped them into the ceiling, which is what's above the ceiling drop ceiling in a typical office building.

111
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,044
Speaker 0: Where does that air go?

112
00:06:12,144 --> 00:06:14,657
Speaker 0: Once the area above the drop ceiling is filled with hot air.

113
00:06:14,757 --> 00:06:15,280
Speaker 0: Good question.

114
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,184
Speaker 1: So we'll get back to that.

115
00:06:16,204 --> 00:06:16,766
Speaker 1: Okay.

116
00:06:17,007 --> 00:06:18,212
Speaker 0: Is there a vent up there?

117
00:06:18,614 --> 00:06:19,618
Speaker 1: So a good question.

118
00:06:19,638 --> 00:06:20,481
Speaker 1: We'll get back to that.

119
00:06:20,501 --> 00:06:20,803
Speaker 0: Okay.

120
00:06:20,983 --> 00:06:23,614
Speaker 1: So the intakes, there were no hoses connected.

121
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:25,561
Speaker 1: They were drawing air from inside of the room.

122
00:06:26,204 --> 00:06:31,584
Speaker 1: So they were sucking air from the inside of the room over the condenser to cool it and then putting it back into the room.

123
00:06:32,046 --> 00:06:39,395
Speaker 1: They were simultaneously sucking air from the room to cool the hot end of the air conditioner and pushing it out into.

124
00:06:39,415 --> 00:06:40,720
Speaker 1: for now dev null.

125
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,764
Speaker 1: Let's assume it's definitely no.

126
00:06:42,805 --> 00:06:43,186
Speaker 0: Okay.

127
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:49,067
Speaker 1: This will cause a negative differential, which is why you had to keep the door open.

128
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:51,180
Speaker 1: Cause otherwise basically the room would just get stagnant.

129
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,667
Speaker 1: The air conditions wouldn't fucking work.

130
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:53,190
Speaker 0: No.

131
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,758
Speaker 0: So you needed air to come into the room.

132
00:06:54,859 --> 00:06:54,939
Speaker 0: Yes.

133
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,640
Speaker 1: So, but at the same time he was sucking the cold air that he just made back out into dev null.

134
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:04,816
Speaker 1: So I did a little bit of investigation and a little hint.

135
00:07:04,836 --> 00:07:05,479
Speaker 1: I'm going to move on.

136
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,193
Speaker 0: I wanted this and go to be forever, but it worked as long as the door was open.

137
00:07:08,574 --> 00:07:16,030
Speaker 1: So I did some testing by taking a receipt because that's really light paper to figure out where the air differentials were by like holding it up to different cracks.

138
00:07:16,451 --> 00:07:18,340
Speaker 1: And I realized the ceiling was also just fucking open.

139
00:07:18,661 --> 00:07:19,745
Speaker 1: So I sealed the ceiling.

140
00:07:19,765 --> 00:07:26,831
Speaker 1: I cooked both tubes of the air conditioners from both units into the ceiling, which theoretically would be pressure neutral.

141
00:07:27,854 --> 00:07:29,400
Speaker 1: And then I closed the fucking door.

142
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:31,389
Speaker 1: So theoretically the room would be pressure neutral.

143
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:44,740
Speaker 1: The end result, the room is slightly pressure negative due to what appears to be a negative differential on the currently inactive air conditioning for the building that actually vents into the top of the room, which I'm not going to seal because that could cause chaos.

144
00:07:46,381 --> 00:07:50,134
Speaker 1: And there is a return for the air conditioners active in the ceiling.

145
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:59,309
Speaker 1: And as far as I can tell, I have not significantly elevated the temperature in the ceiling by more than like five degrees and the air is going fucking somewhere.

146
00:08:00,092 --> 00:08:02,017
Speaker 0: is the, uh, is the room nice and chilly.

147
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:06,596
Speaker 1: So now the room is nice and chilly and our air conditioners are not running 24 seven inefficiently.

148
00:08:06,616 --> 00:08:10,553
Speaker 1: I've probably saved someone a ridiculous amount of money on their electric bill.

149
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,140
Speaker 0: What about fixing the fire?

150
00:08:13,122 --> 00:08:19,190
Speaker 1: I just took the unit that was on fire and threw it away and replaced it with the new unit that now won't catch fire because it's not a new one on Amazon.

151
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:21,239
Speaker 1: It's not running horribly inefficiently.

152
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:22,323
Speaker 0: Okay.

153
00:08:23,065 --> 00:08:24,249
Speaker 0: So that is my odyssey.

154
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:24,952
Speaker 1: I did it.

155
00:08:25,012 --> 00:08:28,584
Speaker 1: I did the kind of thing that I used to do as a job, maybe 10 years ago.

156
00:08:28,604 --> 00:08:29,407
Speaker 0: All right.

157
00:08:29,568 --> 00:08:31,033
Speaker 0: I have a, I have a small tidbit here.

158
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:36,592
Speaker 0: So you notice I'm wearing not jeans and a t-shirt because you're wearing khaki.

159
00:08:36,613 --> 00:08:37,355
Speaker 1: What the fuck?

160
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:37,777
Speaker 1: Yeah.

161
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,707
Speaker 1: The, uh, well you have your khaki killed, I guess.

162
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:44,520
Speaker 0: So work, we were going to eat at a fancy restaurant for free.

163
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,860
Speaker 0: So I'm not going to complain, but the restaurant had a sign that said, please dress appropriately.

164
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,229
Speaker 1: You know, I'll just say this.

165
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:59,717
Speaker 1: I have never been turned away from a restaurant for inappropriate attire, even though I have often been dressed directly against their posted rules.

166
00:08:59,858 --> 00:09:04,037
Speaker 0: This place is pretty crazy because we had a reservation for noon, which is when they opened.

167
00:09:04,318 --> 00:09:05,302
Speaker 0: We got there like 1150.

168
00:09:05,302 --> 00:09:09,136
Speaker 0: The door wasn't even open, but there are people waiting.

169
00:09:09,156 --> 00:09:12,369
Speaker 0: And then when the doors finally opened, it was like a lot of mob.

170
00:09:12,489 --> 00:09:15,060
Speaker 0: And then by the time we were done eating, the place is jam packed.

171
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:22,369
Speaker 0: The other people at my table, my coworkers saw a famous person I never heard of and were like, Ooh, do you remember the guy's name?

172
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:23,616
Speaker 0: It was some, it was some lady.

173
00:09:23,636 --> 00:09:24,822
Speaker 1: Do you remember the girl's name?

174
00:09:24,962 --> 00:09:26,147
Speaker 0: No, no idea whatsoever.

175
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:26,308
Speaker 0: Okay.

176
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:26,970
Speaker 1: I'm just curious.

177
00:09:27,914 --> 00:09:29,320
Speaker 0: A not important famous person.

178
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:36,770
Speaker 0: But whatever the, uh, the important thing that I want to discuss here is that on the menu, I was looking at the non alcoholic beverages.

179
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:43,695
Speaker 0: The, in fact, the waiters specifically mentioned in the giant book of beverages that there were non alcoholic beverages.

180
00:09:44,277 --> 00:09:45,220
Speaker 0: So besides water.

181
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:56,567
Speaker 0: So I took a look and I went going down the list and it's like, Oh, you know, water, some kind of, you know, it's funny because we were just at that fancy Russian restaurant last night and they had the odd juices.

182
00:09:56,848 --> 00:09:57,149
Speaker 0: Yeah.

183
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,777
Speaker 0: Well that was cucumber juice I had there.

184
00:09:58,978 --> 00:10:00,728
Speaker 1: Well they had the other juices too, but they were out of them.

185
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:00,989
Speaker 1: Yeah.

186
00:10:01,331 --> 00:10:04,808
Speaker 0: But going down the list, it was like, you know, fancy, weird water.

187
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:05,853
Speaker 0: They had, what's that?

188
00:10:05,993 --> 00:10:08,826
Speaker 0: The, the water that was at the Italian restaurants and Pellegrino.

189
00:10:08,906 --> 00:10:09,027
Speaker 1: Yeah.

190
00:10:09,047 --> 00:10:10,896
Speaker 0: They had San Pellegrino mixed with shit.

191
00:10:11,197 --> 00:10:13,790
Speaker 1: And they had, uh, it's just fucking seltzer mineral water.

192
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:14,594
Speaker 1: It's not special.

193
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:15,016
Speaker 1: Right.

194
00:10:15,096 --> 00:10:21,287
Speaker 0: And then they had, you know, all those things that you always mix with alcohol that aren't alcohol mixed together, like bitters and something else.

195
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:22,351
Speaker 0: Yeah.

196
00:10:22,592 --> 00:10:27,032
Speaker 1: But then I get down to the bottom and it says you could, actually, yeah, I could make you a non alcoholic beverage.

197
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:28,742
Speaker 0: I don't really want to drink any of that nasty.

198
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:29,264
Speaker 0: It's awesome.

199
00:10:29,284 --> 00:10:30,188
Speaker 1: Bitters is not bitter.

200
00:10:30,228 --> 00:10:31,352
Speaker 1: It's delicious.

201
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:31,794
Speaker 0: Whatever.

202
00:10:31,854 --> 00:10:36,250
Speaker 0: Anyway, going on the list and it just says fucking Gertschwemener juice.

203
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:38,618
Speaker 0: And then it says Pinot Noir juice.

204
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:42,136
Speaker 0: And I asked the guy and I'm like, is that actually just fucking wine grapes made into juice?

205
00:10:42,619 --> 00:10:43,623
Speaker 0: I didn't say fucking.

206
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:47,335
Speaker 0: I was like, is that just wine grapes made into juice?

207
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:47,897
Speaker 0: He's like, yeah.

208
00:10:47,937 --> 00:10:49,443
Speaker 0: I'm like, I want that right now.

209
00:10:49,644 --> 00:10:50,647
Speaker 1: I would drink that.

210
00:10:50,828 --> 00:10:52,052
Speaker 0: It was $9 a glass.

211
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,899
Speaker 0: I know I wasn't paying for it.

212
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,350
Speaker 1: You know, the last time I ordered wine at a restaurant, I paid $7 for my glass.

213
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:02,065
Speaker 1: So it was $9 for a glass of Pinot Noir grape juice.

214
00:11:02,266 --> 00:11:02,687
Speaker 1: How was it?

215
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:07,664
Speaker 0: It was freezing cold, like not ice, obviously, but like as cold as you can get.

216
00:11:07,684 --> 00:11:12,844
Speaker 1: I like how the colloquial freezing cold actually was really the wrong thing to say that it was.

217
00:11:12,925 --> 00:11:14,332
Speaker 0: It was basically as cold as ice water.

218
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:16,763
Speaker 1: You could say it's freezing has not frozen yet.

219
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,489
Speaker 0: It was as cold as ice water.

220
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:20,295
Speaker 0: You see the bottle was condensing.

221
00:11:20,315 --> 00:11:23,530
Speaker 0: He poured it into the, you know, he treated it like it was wine.

222
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,058
Speaker 0: He showed it to me, poured it in the glass.

223
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:26,765
Speaker 0: I tasted it to make sure it wasn't ruined.

224
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:27,568
Speaker 0: It wasn't.

225
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,281
Speaker 0: It was pretty much the best grape juice I ever had ever.

226
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:35,634
Speaker 0: So I bought a whole case of it, which is not expensive at all.

227
00:11:36,316 --> 00:11:36,737
Speaker 0: Basically.

228
00:11:36,758 --> 00:11:40,328
Speaker 0: I mean, it costs my company $9 for the eight ounces.

229
00:11:40,349 --> 00:11:41,693
Speaker 0: They gave me 12, maybe.

230
00:11:42,174 --> 00:11:42,395
Speaker 0: Right.

231
00:11:42,676 --> 00:11:55,600
Speaker 0: If you buy a whole case of it from the exact same place against his Navarro, which is just some seems like basically the apple, uh, the sweet apple acres of California, basically, uh, and grapes instead of apples.

232
00:11:56,301 --> 00:11:59,312
Speaker 0: It was basically comes out to like eight, $9 a bottle.

233
00:11:59,934 --> 00:12:00,877
Speaker 1: So it's not bad.

234
00:12:00,917 --> 00:12:10,091
Speaker 1: Like I was saying over our Twitter before the, uh, my favorite wine that I purchase on a regular basis is between eight and $12 a bottle and much less if I buy it by the case.

235
00:12:10,292 --> 00:12:12,039
Speaker 0: So we'll see when it shows up.

236
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,685
Speaker 0: Apparently come, here's the thing.

237
00:12:13,725 --> 00:12:16,376
Speaker 0: It comes with, you know, it comes with 12 bottles.

238
00:12:16,758 --> 00:12:20,776
Speaker 0: I think five of which are the white grapes and six of which are the red grapes.

239
00:12:20,816 --> 00:12:21,941
Speaker 0: Or maybe it's the other way around.

240
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:38,635
Speaker 0: And then they give you one bottle of verjuice or V E R J U S, which are probably pronouncing incorrectly, which is they take the unripe grapes and they squeeze them mad early and they make sort of like this really, you know, sour kind of thing.

241
00:12:38,836 --> 00:12:44,014
Speaker 0: And what you can use it for is you don't just drink that because why the fuck would you drink that?

242
00:12:44,456 --> 00:12:51,201
Speaker 0: What you do is you can use it a instead of lemon juice in pretty much anything that requires lemon juice, including lemonade.

243
00:12:51,622 --> 00:12:53,046
Speaker 0: So you can make verjuice aid.

244
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:58,843
Speaker 0: You can also use it instead of vinegar and say something like salad dressing.

245
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,974
Speaker 0: So, and then they had a PDF on there.

246
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,102
Speaker 1: Use that with some salad dressing instead of vinegar.

247
00:13:04,162 --> 00:13:09,320
Speaker 1: And I put some like, ah, let's see some oranges and apples and walnuts and go cheese.

248
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:09,882
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

249
00:13:09,942 --> 00:13:16,787
Speaker 0: That kind of, well, I can do is I can go get that exact salad from the salad fresh coat near my work and say no dressing, bro.

250
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:18,993
Speaker 0: I got my own.

251
00:13:19,053 --> 00:13:27,142
Speaker 1: And then, uh, they got to have walnuts and feta on their website, like a goat cheese with like a little bit of lavender in it on their website.

252
00:13:27,443 --> 00:13:31,878
Speaker 0: They have a PDF of recipes where you can use verjuice as the ingredient.

253
00:13:31,898 --> 00:13:32,761
Speaker 0: It's like the very juice.

254
00:13:32,921 --> 00:13:36,011
Speaker 0: like PDF has a ton of fucking recipes to a lot of them.

255
00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:39,864
Speaker 0: So, uh, I'm a big fan of this, a fancy juice.

256
00:13:40,206 --> 00:13:49,496
Speaker 0: And I think I'm going to start, maybe I'm going to try to find or maybe start my own juice from the fancy bottles on poison.

257
00:13:49,776 --> 00:13:54,095
Speaker 1: You're going to get to hear the things I've had to hear from you for the last like 10 years about my wine.

258
00:13:54,115 --> 00:13:55,059
Speaker 0: You know what I mean?

259
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,687
Speaker 1: You're spending $9 a bottle in grape juice.

260
00:13:57,747 --> 00:13:59,212
Speaker 1: Ketim's a dollar 50.

261
00:13:59,212 --> 00:14:01,038
Speaker 0: Ketim doesn't taste very good.

262
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:01,981
Speaker 1: Oh, oh.

263
00:14:02,061 --> 00:14:04,310
Speaker 1: So you're saying that the more expensive one tastes better.

264
00:14:04,651 --> 00:14:05,193
Speaker 0: No, it's.

265
00:14:05,314 --> 00:14:09,751
Speaker 0: it's that these are the reason it's expensive is not because it's better.

266
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:18,883
Speaker 0: It is because they could have turned these grapes into wine and at least wine that I only pay $8 a bottle for instead of the $9 a bottle you're paying for this juice.

267
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,874
Speaker 0: Uh, well, no, their wine is $20 a bottle.

268
00:14:22,894 --> 00:14:26,906
Speaker 1: So they could, they could have, I can get higher rated wine for less money.

269
00:14:26,926 --> 00:14:28,692
Speaker 0: They could have doubled the value.

270
00:14:28,712 --> 00:14:31,762
Speaker 0: That's the exact wine.

271
00:14:31,802 --> 00:14:33,167
Speaker 1: The Wilm one is the one I drink.

272
00:14:33,288 --> 00:14:35,476
Speaker 1: I bought it for as low as $7 a bottle.

273
00:14:35,536 --> 00:14:35,938
Speaker 1: Yeah.

274
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:39,511
Speaker 0: But this, they sell it for 20 so they could double.

275
00:14:39,852 --> 00:14:45,220
Speaker 0: from their perspective, regardless of if you're getting better wine than they make and who knows how good theirs is because I haven't tasted it.

276
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,022
Speaker 0: Right.

277
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:52,265
Speaker 0: Uh, they could double the value of those grapes by letting them sit around and turn into wine, but they choose not to.

278
00:14:53,168 --> 00:14:53,891
Speaker 0: So there you go.

279
00:14:54,031 --> 00:14:54,453
Speaker 0: Not bad.

280
00:14:54,513 --> 00:14:57,082
Speaker 0: Which benefits me not wanting to drink poison.

281
00:14:57,343 --> 00:14:57,905
Speaker 1: So it's Monday.

282
00:14:57,945 --> 00:14:58,748
Speaker 1: It's not the lounge.

283
00:14:58,768 --> 00:14:59,491
Speaker 1: You got any news?

284
00:15:00,054 --> 00:15:00,917
Speaker 0: Do I have a news?

285
00:15:00,977 --> 00:15:01,640
Speaker 0: I do indeed.

286
00:15:02,461 --> 00:15:41,101
Speaker 0: I've been working, I guess, you know, one of my many half actually way less than 1% finished projects is sort of the ultimate backup, save your ass thing where basically you'll set up like get input from Twitter, get input from flicker backup to S3, backup to my hard drive, you know, basically something that will download and rescue all your files and wherever cloud services or local sources they may be on and then back them up and whatever places they need to back up to synchronize your blog posts, tweets, photos, videos, all your data's documents in all the places.

287
00:15:41,121 --> 00:15:42,205
Speaker 0: So you can't be fucked.

288
00:15:43,328 --> 00:15:48,548
Speaker 0: Uh, so Twitter, the problem with them is that, yeah, you can sort of back up your tweets for a while.

289
00:15:48,608 --> 00:15:53,809
Speaker 0: I was using this one website that would read your tweets every day and then sort of put them in, you know, files.

290
00:15:54,571 --> 00:15:59,388
Speaker 0: Um, but that sort of needed to be constantly running and reading your tweets all the time.

291
00:15:59,991 --> 00:16:07,055
Speaker 0: Twitter is finally coming out with something delicious has had for a long time, which is download all your tweets ever.

292
00:16:07,937 --> 00:16:17,111
Speaker 1: Now this is actually kind of interesting because Twitter has been in pissing matches with pretty much everyone over their APIs and data access and agreements.

293
00:16:17,171 --> 00:16:21,046
Speaker 0: Well, Twitter doesn't want to let people access every tweet ever, right?

294
00:16:21,126 --> 00:16:24,617
Speaker 0: Is this is all about you access your own exactly.

295
00:16:24,798 --> 00:16:37,508
Speaker 1: But for example, like recently they got into a thing where they, they won't let you have like an embedded link anymore with Instagram because they don't want people to, you know, Instagram shows not to do that because Facebook bought Instagram.

296
00:16:38,993 --> 00:16:40,899
Speaker 0: So that's one of those, he said, she said battles.

297
00:16:40,939 --> 00:16:42,726
Speaker 0: We don't know who's good, who's bad.

298
00:16:42,766 --> 00:16:50,011
Speaker 1: The gist of it is that basically all these services like this that are not federated are trying to monetize.

299
00:16:50,111 --> 00:16:54,928
Speaker 1: And the only way they can monetize is to make sure that people have to use them and their stuff.

300
00:16:55,169 --> 00:17:00,404
Speaker 1: They can't just go to like Tumblr, but also see everyone's tweets, which fuck them.

301
00:17:00,484 --> 00:17:02,150
Speaker 1: But that's a separate show for a separate day.

302
00:17:04,801 --> 00:17:04,963
Speaker 0: Yeah.

303
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:08,945
Speaker 0: But this is really interesting because I actually seem to have a really good interface for looking at all your tweets.

304
00:17:09,388 --> 00:17:13,325
Speaker 0: And it's also going to be really interesting once people have access to their own old tweets.

305
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:19,303
Speaker 0: If anyone like voluntarily combines their tweets together for data purposes.

306
00:17:19,684 --> 00:17:25,424
Speaker 0: or be what kind of interesting things people discover from analyzing their own past tweets.

307
00:17:25,565 --> 00:17:30,830
Speaker 1: You know, I'm going to try to, we should come up with a program that makes it very easy for you to download your archive and then say, boop.

308
00:17:31,111 --> 00:17:32,295
Speaker 1: And now it's all public again.

309
00:17:32,316 --> 00:17:37,114
Speaker 1: Someone else can aggregate it and recreate effectively all of Twitter.

310
00:17:37,335 --> 00:17:39,585
Speaker 0: We can make a website like upload your Twitter archive here.

311
00:17:39,605 --> 00:17:44,126
Speaker 0: Uh, but no, I'm going to try to make something that does really simple stuff that will be entertaining.

312
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:49,811
Speaker 0: Like count the number of times you said, fuck, count the number of times you added who's, who did you at the most?

313
00:17:50,132 --> 00:17:51,578
Speaker 0: count the number of times I did that.

314
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:53,064
Speaker 0: There's that retweet the most.

315
00:17:53,084 --> 00:17:56,297
Speaker 1: There's that one nice, uh, website, not the scammy one.

316
00:17:56,317 --> 00:17:58,968
Speaker 1: That'll do it like the pseudo analysis of your Twitter feed.

317
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:06,884
Speaker 0: This is going to do just, you know, that kind of boring non-scientific stuff like count the number of times, you know, which word did you tweet the most often?

318
00:18:07,326 --> 00:18:08,853
Speaker 0: And you know, this thing is things like that.

319
00:18:09,053 --> 00:18:12,309
Speaker 0: They don't mean anything, but they're really kind of interesting and people love that shit.

320
00:18:12,711 --> 00:18:21,632
Speaker 0: So being able to download all your tweets, you know, drag them into this program, click a button and get that information, get a JPEG or something that you can just put on a website somewhere.

321
00:18:21,652 --> 00:18:23,220
Speaker 1: So, you know, somewhat related to that.

322
00:18:23,241 --> 00:18:26,112
Speaker 1: There is a, an article on slash dot right now.

323
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:30,267
Speaker 1: that is, I kind of want to talk about this as a show, so we'll go briefly.

324
00:18:30,748 --> 00:18:32,313
Speaker 1: It's called the web we lost.

325
00:18:32,614 --> 00:18:33,015
Speaker 0: Okay.

326
00:18:33,156 --> 00:18:34,821
Speaker 0: I did see links to this article everywhere.

327
00:18:34,861 --> 00:18:48,659
Speaker 1: In the early days of, you know, web 2.0 back when there was 2.0, not so early days when there was a web 2.0 as in there was an internet of web rings and static content.

328
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:52,391
Speaker 1: And then the idea of, you know, modern interactivity appeared.

329
00:18:53,033 --> 00:19:00,120
Speaker 1: People were, you know, sharing things between websites and embedding data in websites and the first social networks were arising.

330
00:19:00,921 --> 00:19:03,671
Speaker 1: And that was a really open world in terms of data.

331
00:19:03,691 --> 00:19:05,316
Speaker 1: The data was accepted.

332
00:19:05,357 --> 00:19:12,422
Speaker 1: You're basically every website wanted to make your data as open and accessible as possible and shared as much as possible.

333
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,874
Speaker 0: Cause that was the hot was how you got popular, right?

334
00:19:14,914 --> 00:19:16,160
Speaker 0: How did Twitter become popular?

335
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:16,260
Speaker 0: in?

336
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:16,944
Speaker 0: oh seven?

337
00:19:17,004 --> 00:19:21,885
Speaker 0: by having an API where you could do whatever the fuck you wanted with tweets or posting to tweets.

338
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:24,897
Speaker 1: But now, so web 2.0 evolved and evolved and evolved.

339
00:19:24,917 --> 00:19:28,593
Speaker 1: And now there's the big debate over what and when and where the web 3.0 will be.

340
00:19:28,613 --> 00:19:36,738
Speaker 1: And you know, but basically argues that everything we gained in web 2.0 is it's not gone yet, but it's rapidly disappearing.

341
00:19:36,939 --> 00:19:39,024
Speaker 0: Everyone's locking down their APIs.

342
00:19:39,165 --> 00:19:49,396
Speaker 1: We went from a federated model back to a sole provider walled garden model with all these pissing matches between the few people who provide this stuff.

343
00:19:49,818 --> 00:19:55,120
Speaker 1: So instead of every website having its own little like federated, follow me back, yo, Tumblr has its one thing.

344
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,425
Speaker 1: Twitter has its other thing.

345
00:19:56,707 --> 00:19:58,717
Speaker 1: Everyone fights to monetize and won't let you connect.

346
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:01,228
Speaker 1: And he's basically saying that we need to stop this.

347
00:20:02,032 --> 00:20:02,876
Speaker 0: It'll happen eventually.

348
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,041
Speaker 0: This is what always happens, right?

349
00:20:04,101 --> 00:20:08,997
Speaker 0: Is that every, you know, anything that's low and not strong goes open.

350
00:20:09,057 --> 00:20:13,980
Speaker 0: and by going open, they become strong, but because they're open, they can't make any goddamn money.

351
00:20:14,261 --> 00:20:16,371
Speaker 0: Except with advertising, but, uh, right.

352
00:20:16,652 --> 00:20:18,320
Speaker 0: It's cause it's too free and too open.

353
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,645
Speaker 0: They can't make any money.

354
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:24,954
Speaker 0: And even if they put ads in the, if the ads get too bad, everyone will just bail with their data and go somewhere else.

355
00:20:25,034 --> 00:20:26,040
Speaker 0: It's open and has no ads.

356
00:20:26,301 --> 00:20:28,531
Speaker 0: And they'll keep moving to the no ad place over and over.

357
00:20:28,551 --> 00:20:28,711
Speaker 0: Right?

358
00:20:29,214 --> 00:20:30,339
Speaker 0: So what do they do?

359
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:35,077
Speaker 0: They start to lock down and people will tolerate it cause you gradually do it.

360
00:20:35,097 --> 00:20:36,583
Speaker 0: If you did it all at once, people like, fuck that.

361
00:20:36,884 --> 00:20:44,171
Speaker 0: But they do it gradually and slowly closing it up, closing it up, no systems slip through their fingers.

362
00:20:44,231 --> 00:20:47,705
Speaker 1: And then it does this back in the day, let's talk nineties.

363
00:20:47,866 --> 00:20:53,333
Speaker 0: in the nineties when things like the CDT, I mean, do you want to talk about the original burners leeway?

364
00:20:53,414 --> 00:20:54,600
Speaker 0: Every page is Wikipedia.

365
00:20:54,981 --> 00:20:56,124
Speaker 1: No, I do.

366
00:20:56,164 --> 00:20:57,168
Speaker 1: But now right now, okay.

367
00:20:57,268 --> 00:21:18,455
Speaker 1: So I remember in the nineties when I really got into encryption and you know, things like, you know, before waste even like using PGP and PGP phone and, you know, tempest and protection and all that crazy bullshit was because back then really like the main operating systems you have had access to were pretty locked down.

368
00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:28,855
Speaker 1: And there was a fear, especially with CDB TPA type type stuff coming down the pipe that the governments of the world might actually crack down on computers and get to the middle earlier.

369
00:21:28,976 --> 00:21:30,903
Speaker 1: So nerd people were like, Oh fuck.

370
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:36,809
Speaker 1: And there was a big explosion of interest in Linux and encryption and all this stuff that drove a lot of cool things later on down the road.

371
00:21:37,613 --> 00:21:39,320
Speaker 1: And now, I mean, I use windows for everything.

372
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,933
Speaker 1: I've gone back to all those worlds because things are pretty safe.

373
00:21:43,154 --> 00:21:46,888
Speaker 1: But on the far off horizon now, we're seeing the slow lockdown happen again.

374
00:21:46,908 --> 00:21:55,383
Speaker 1: And I think it'll hit a crisis point where the nerds like us are already looking ahead toward the federated models to replace Twitter when Twitter finally fucks.

375
00:21:55,403 --> 00:21:56,046
Speaker 0: Well, we did that.

376
00:21:56,147 --> 00:21:58,277
Speaker 0: People saw that immediately with the Konica.

377
00:21:58,318 --> 00:21:59,964
Speaker 0: They just did a shitty ass job.

378
00:22:00,305 --> 00:22:03,697
Speaker 1: But I think there is a place for a federated replacement to Twitter.

379
00:22:03,717 --> 00:22:12,809
Speaker 1: And I think if they keep cracking down on their APIs and they keep locking themselves up, nerds are going to move on to something new like nerds always do.

380
00:22:12,829 --> 00:22:18,171
Speaker 0: I mean, Google plus isn't really failing, but it's not really taking off and not yet killing the world either.

381
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:20,743
Speaker 0: But then again, I see Google plus right now.

382
00:22:20,764 --> 00:22:22,634
Speaker 0: I'm not saying this is a locked in prediction.

383
00:22:22,654 --> 00:22:34,936
Speaker 0: I don't have a lot of confidence in this, but it sort of feels, you know, Google plus right now feels the way Google chat did early on where a few peep cool people are using that instead of, say, aim.

384
00:22:35,076 --> 00:22:36,561
Speaker 1: I'm trying to use it more and more.

385
00:22:36,883 --> 00:22:37,204
Speaker 0: Right.

386
00:22:37,705 --> 00:22:41,237
Speaker 0: And but everyone else is still using aim and MSN and Yahoo.

387
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:42,903
Speaker 0: But a few cool people are using Google plus.

388
00:22:42,943 --> 00:22:51,432
Speaker 0: But meanwhile, nowadays, Google chat went from being that sort of other instant messaging thing that only a few people use to being the one.

389
00:22:51,753 --> 00:22:54,784
Speaker 0: And aim is dead and ICQ is dead and MSN is dead.

390
00:22:54,824 --> 00:22:55,466
Speaker 0: And then Yahoo's.

391
00:22:55,486 --> 00:23:02,213
Speaker 0: So maybe Google plus will follow the same path and kill Twitter and Facebook, possibly not saying it's for sure.

392
00:23:02,293 --> 00:23:08,220
Speaker 0: I'm just saying that's what it feels like, because I have the same feels using Google plus that I had using Google chat in the early days.

393
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:08,661
Speaker 0: Yeah.

394
00:23:09,183 --> 00:23:12,898
Speaker 1: But so talking about free stuff and ads, I don't want to talk about this.

395
00:23:12,918 --> 00:23:14,043
Speaker 1: There's an article that's pretty awesome.

396
00:23:14,063 --> 00:23:20,454
Speaker 1: Basically, everyone's rumbling about our ad blocking things going to be made illegal and or will there be lawsuits again?

397
00:23:20,554 --> 00:23:24,468
Speaker 1: You're going to the main bit again, which is going to be relevant to the main bit.

398
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:31,113
Speaker 1: But I just want to point out this is this issue was an issue in the nineties and it disappeared.

399
00:23:31,354 --> 00:23:33,843
Speaker 1: All the nerds was like, yeah, I just block every ad no matter what.

400
00:23:33,923 --> 00:23:34,546
Speaker 1: Fuck you guys.

401
00:23:34,607 --> 00:23:34,989
Speaker 1: That's right.

402
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:37,702
Speaker 1: And normal people are slowly learning to block ads, but it wasn't.

403
00:23:37,742 --> 00:23:38,988
Speaker 1: It's not enough for majority of matter.

404
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:43,887
Speaker 1: But now suddenly there's rumblings of the ethical question and the legal question.

405
00:23:43,907 --> 00:23:47,320
Speaker 0: Again, we already had this discussion the first time.

406
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,505
Speaker 1: So we had this discussion.

407
00:23:48,525 --> 00:23:49,269
Speaker 1: It was done.

408
00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:53,148
Speaker 1: The answer was if data's on the internet, I can do whatever I want with it.

409
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:55,200
Speaker 1: I'm the one who controls the display side.

410
00:23:55,381 --> 00:23:56,766
Speaker 0: My computer sent you some bits.

411
00:23:56,907 --> 00:23:59,336
Speaker 0: Your computer willingly sent me some bits.

412
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:02,269
Speaker 0: I can do what my computer does with those bits is up to me.

413
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:09,194
Speaker 1: Now, the reason the argument is going to be different this time is because phones are pretty locked down.

414
00:24:09,274 --> 00:24:11,220
Speaker 1: They are and much harder are going to be.

415
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,822
Speaker 1: I mean, already I can't block ads, at least the kinds of ads they're slipping into the stream on my phone.

416
00:24:16,862 --> 00:24:21,240
Speaker 1: And as a result, I'm using my phone for fewer and fewer things where an ad could appear.

417
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:28,291
Speaker 0: Well, this is, you know, this is the free software, you know, like the, you know, the Richard Stallman situation, right?

418
00:24:28,412 --> 00:24:29,175
Speaker 0: I have a computer.

419
00:24:29,477 --> 00:24:30,120
Speaker 0: It's my phone.

420
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:33,774
Speaker 0: It does things with bits that I did not tell it to do.

421
00:24:33,894 --> 00:24:38,591
Speaker 0: I wanted to do something with those bits, but I can't make it do that because it's all closed.

422
00:24:39,495 --> 00:24:41,542
Speaker 0: Therefore, it shows me ads when I don't want to see him.

423
00:24:42,165 --> 00:24:46,948
Speaker 1: So we won't have that argument, but just remember this is, this is burning on the horizon and it's going to come.

424
00:24:46,968 --> 00:24:47,954
Speaker 1: And you know what's going to happen?

425
00:24:48,336 --> 00:24:50,809
Speaker 1: The same thing that happened before nerds will block ads.

426
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:53,984
Speaker 1: No one else will be able to, and eventually the nerds will make it easy for normal people.

427
00:24:54,224 --> 00:24:55,830
Speaker 1: And then the cycle will repeat.

428
00:24:56,172 --> 00:25:04,518
Speaker 1: The question is, will the advertising industry as a whole collapse before this next round or not, which I'm, I give it a 30% shot.

429
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:12,199
Speaker 0: So I think, you know, we just, as the fundamental problem of the world has discussions, right?

430
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,548
Speaker 0: It's like someone was just born just now.

431
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,175
Speaker 0: They haven't seen the Godfather.

432
00:25:16,436 --> 00:25:18,504
Speaker 0: They also have never had an argument about copyright.

433
00:25:18,565 --> 00:25:23,006
Speaker 1: They've also never seen a world where the TSA doesn't touch my genitalia to let me get on a plane.

434
00:25:23,087 --> 00:25:23,268
Speaker 0: Right.

435
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:29,158
Speaker 0: But that discussion of copyright for that new person will happen again, just like they will see the Godfather having never seen it.

436
00:25:29,198 --> 00:25:31,065
Speaker 0: They will have that discussion having never had it.

437
00:25:31,407 --> 00:25:44,133
Speaker 0: And every discussion that we, that we don't solve once and for all, such that there is no one complaining about it, will repeat the same points over and over again with no new points discovered, except for science.

438
00:25:44,254 --> 00:25:46,886
Speaker 1: Jon Stewart made a really funny science.

439
00:25:46,906 --> 00:25:48,131
Speaker 0: There'll be nothing new to say.

440
00:25:48,152 --> 00:25:53,780
Speaker 1: There's a recent daily show where he was like, you talked about the fact that the SCOTUS is taking up the two gay rights cases on marriage.

441
00:25:54,362 --> 00:26:00,183
Speaker 1: And he's like, finally, the Supreme court is going to answer whether or not gays getting married is a fundamental right.

442
00:26:00,664 --> 00:26:04,174
Speaker 1: Because when they ruled on abortion, that ended the argument.

443
00:26:05,979 --> 00:26:12,936
Speaker 0: No argument doesn't end when the Supreme court says it, it ends when you know, old people die.

444
00:26:13,057 --> 00:26:13,438
Speaker 0: Yes.

445
00:26:13,518 --> 00:26:13,759
Speaker 0: Yeah.

446
00:26:14,582 --> 00:26:22,716
Speaker 1: So to, to segue into the main bit that someone proposed a pretty interesting answer to this whole thing, the ad thing, uh, basically everything we just talked about.

447
00:26:22,776 --> 00:26:23,157
Speaker 1: Okay.

448
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,732
Speaker 1: The question is, is the flicker API, a national treasure?

449
00:26:28,455 --> 00:26:29,899
Speaker 0: What, what is the language?

450
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:31,385
Speaker 0: I mean, do you want to talk legally here?

451
00:26:31,485 --> 00:26:36,024
Speaker 0: Or do you want to talk ethically, morally, uh, open API, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

452
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:39,603
Speaker 1: Worried that the possibility of Yahoo might do the same thing with flipper API's.

453
00:26:39,884 --> 00:26:45,304
Speaker 0: Some guy named Dave Weiner just launched a, Dave Weiner is the guy who invented a podcast.

454
00:26:45,345 --> 00:26:48,254
Speaker 1: Basically he launched one of those petitions to Obama.

455
00:26:48,595 --> 00:27:01,320
Speaker 1: He's asking that the federal government through the national historic landmark act declared the API to flicker as it currently exists, a national historic landmark, meaning it cannot be fucked with by anyone, even flicker.

456
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,203
Speaker 1: And they have to maintain it.

457
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,999
Speaker 0: That is a really liquor goes out of business.

458
00:27:06,821 --> 00:27:11,340
Speaker 1: If I was government would get control of it and have to maintain it with tax money.

459
00:27:11,841 --> 00:27:14,273
Speaker 0: If I was Yahoo, I'd be like, fine, take it.

460
00:27:14,293 --> 00:27:15,177
Speaker 0: We don't have to pay for it anymore.

461
00:27:15,237 --> 00:27:15,298
Speaker 0: Woo.

462
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:16,381
Speaker 0: Yeah.

463
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:17,447
Speaker 0: There goes all our costs.

464
00:27:17,607 --> 00:27:18,009
Speaker 1: But you know what?

465
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:29,026
Speaker 1: At the same time, think about if the guy, think about the idea that data that is out there on the internet can be a landmark, just like some crappy old farmhouse can be a landmark.

466
00:27:29,066 --> 00:27:37,165
Speaker 0: Well then maybe we should have the language of the law.

467
00:27:37,226 --> 00:27:40,120
Speaker 0: What does the thing have to be to be a landmark?

468
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,767
Speaker 1: Do you really think I know that?

469
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,860
Speaker 0: Does it say in the article that you're reading?

470
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,187
Speaker 0: Then you're not being very helpful.

471
00:27:46,288 --> 00:27:49,028
Speaker 1: Do you want me to be a journalist or you want me to read this whole thing?

472
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:50,420
Speaker 1: Uh, it's gonna take too long.

473
00:27:57,481 --> 00:27:59,929
Speaker 1: So let's just move right on to things of the day.

474
00:27:59,949 --> 00:28:03,340
Speaker 1: A friend of mine, a coworker showed me this.

475
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,366
Speaker 1: It was pretty hilarious.

476
00:28:04,446 --> 00:28:06,580
Speaker 1: I promised him I would make it a thing of the day on geek nights.

477
00:28:07,422 --> 00:28:08,966
Speaker 1: Uh, I don't know.

478
00:28:08,986 --> 00:28:18,180
Speaker 1: I'm, I am 50 50 on whether or not it is a legit thing that happened or if it is a stage thing from some sort of like comedy skit show.

479
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,180
Speaker 0: I did see the same video and I wasn't totally sure what was going on.

480
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:32,560
Speaker 1: It's hard now because in the modern era, like especially in Brazil, security cameras are HD, so it's not that far out of the realm that the video quality would be this high.

481
00:28:33,102 --> 00:28:36,880
Speaker 1: But I was in Sao Paulo not that long ago and yeah, crime is off the hook.

482
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:43,927
Speaker 1: This is a video of a dude who allegedly parks his car and breaks into a clinic to steal some drugs while he's robbing the clinic.

483
00:28:43,967 --> 00:28:46,197
Speaker 1: Someone steals his car while he's outgoing.

484
00:28:46,238 --> 00:28:47,162
Speaker 1: What the fuck happened to my car?

485
00:28:47,182 --> 00:28:48,832
Speaker 1: Someone else mugs him and steals the drugs.

486
00:28:49,034 --> 00:28:50,080
Speaker 0: Well, it doesn't really mug him.

487
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,689
Speaker 0: They just sort of grab the drugs and run.

488
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:53,560
Speaker 1: basically purse snatches the guy's drugs.

489
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,004
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is.

490
00:28:55,485 --> 00:29:01,143
Speaker 1: If this is true, this is one of the funniest pieces of poetic justice the world has ever seen.

491
00:29:01,163 --> 00:29:07,792
Speaker 1: And if it's not true, it's actually still pretty funny just because the look in the guy's face at the end, he's like, what the fuck?

492
00:29:08,233 --> 00:29:09,177
Speaker 0: He got what he deserves.

493
00:29:09,197 --> 00:29:12,688
Speaker 0: He can't feel bad for him, but it's like, eh, anyway.

494
00:29:13,571 --> 00:29:19,171
Speaker 0: So, you know, a lot of times when you cook something, you got to separate the egg yolk and the cooking by the book.

495
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:19,674
Speaker 0: All right.

496
00:29:19,714 --> 00:29:24,374
Speaker 0: You take, you open up an egg and out comes a yolk and a white crack, crack, crack the egg into the baby.

497
00:29:24,494 --> 00:29:25,237
Speaker 0: Just right.

498
00:29:25,378 --> 00:29:30,161
Speaker 0: If you, and usually the way I separate the egg and the white is usually the way I see people on cooking shows do it.

499
00:29:30,262 --> 00:29:31,446
Speaker 1: I hit X, X, X.

500
00:29:31,948 --> 00:29:34,819
Speaker 0: Now you pour the yolk back and forth between the two egg shells.

501
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:35,963
Speaker 1: You never played Parappa the Rapper?

502
00:29:36,344 --> 00:29:37,087
Speaker 0: I know about it.

503
00:29:37,127 --> 00:29:37,468
Speaker 0: Okay.

504
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:44,215
Speaker 0: So you, uh, you pour the egg yolk back and forth between the two shells while the white part does not pour back.

505
00:29:44,235 --> 00:29:45,280
Speaker 1: You mean like Spike Spiegel does?

506
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:45,761
Speaker 0: Yes.

507
00:29:46,263 --> 00:29:50,984
Speaker 0: And the white part just sort of droops down into the bowl until only you have left in the shell is the yolk.

508
00:29:51,044 --> 00:29:52,912
Speaker 0: And then you can do it with either part.

509
00:29:52,972 --> 00:29:53,454
Speaker 0: what you like.

510
00:29:53,836 --> 00:29:54,599
Speaker 0: That is the method.

511
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,104
Speaker 0: I see most people do that.

512
00:29:56,144 --> 00:30:03,664
Speaker 0: I also do in this video, some awesome Australian dude shows you a far superior method.

513
00:30:04,646 --> 00:30:10,282
Speaker 0: What he does is watch the video and find out, Holy shit, I got to do this for now on.

514
00:30:10,322 --> 00:30:16,546
Speaker 1: I think a better thing to do is to make a device that purports to do this and sell it for 20 bucks as seen on TV.

515
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:18,390
Speaker 0: You'd make at least 1 million.

516
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:20,635
Speaker 0: Does it patent that shit?

517
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:28,283
Speaker 0: So in the moment this video count as prior art, if I patented that, uh, they'd have to find it as prior art.

518
00:30:28,905 --> 00:30:29,849
Speaker 0: Uh, maybe, I don't know.

519
00:30:30,211 --> 00:30:38,601
Speaker 1: So in the meta moment, the book club book, which we're not going to get to until sometime quarter one next year is the great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald famous book.

520
00:30:38,682 --> 00:30:39,264
Speaker 1: I've never read it.

521
00:30:39,344 --> 00:30:42,216
Speaker 1: I feel dumb and lacking for having not read it.

522
00:30:42,296 --> 00:30:45,168
Speaker 1: It's like a big gaping hole in my list of famous books.

523
00:30:45,228 --> 00:30:47,115
Speaker 1: I have plenty of other famous books.

524
00:30:47,236 --> 00:30:48,982
Speaker 0: You have never named another famous book.

525
00:30:49,022 --> 00:30:49,705
Speaker 0: I haven't read that.

526
00:30:49,725 --> 00:30:51,150
Speaker 0: You've never read, never read.

527
00:30:51,572 --> 00:30:52,053
Speaker 1: Okay.

528
00:30:52,154 --> 00:30:54,542
Speaker 1: Mr's never read or seen Macbeth.

529
00:30:54,683 --> 00:30:57,492
Speaker 0: Have you read a tree grows in Brooklyn?

530
00:30:58,355 --> 00:30:59,218
Speaker 1: Uh, actually, no, I haven't.

531
00:30:59,258 --> 00:31:00,523
Speaker 0: Well, there's a famous book you haven't read.

532
00:31:00,684 --> 00:31:01,587
Speaker 0: That was easy.

533
00:31:01,648 --> 00:31:02,150
Speaker 0: First one.

534
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,596
Speaker 1: I think that's worse than Macbeth.

535
00:31:03,938 --> 00:31:04,460
Speaker 0: I don't know.

536
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,187
Speaker 0: I'm not saying it is, or is it?

537
00:31:06,207 --> 00:31:07,572
Speaker 0: I'm saying it's eat.

538
00:31:07,612 --> 00:31:09,038
Speaker 0: There are lots of famous books.

539
00:31:09,178 --> 00:31:15,502
Speaker 0: I don't think there's anyone on earth who's read all the Epic famous classic books because there are just so many.

540
00:31:15,823 --> 00:31:27,914
Speaker 1: So anyway, a kinetic con, the everything convention that we, uh, run the panels and workshops and special events department for, and I have for many years in Connecticut, Hartford in July is a long way out, but it's a long way away.

541
00:31:27,934 --> 00:31:29,020
Speaker 0: Why are we talking about it now?

542
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:38,075
Speaker 1: Well, Scott, because panel submissions, lecture submissions, workshop submissions are open and we're going to start scheduling shit and the next month.

Speaker 0: Ooh, yeah.

545
00:31:43,552 --> 00:31:48,655
Speaker 1: We're so far ahead of the game that I'm assuming something horrible is going to happen to ruin all of this for us.

546
00:31:48,675 --> 00:31:54,740
Speaker 0: The only other convention we need to talk about is the one that is impending quickly less than a month away.

555
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:34,648
Speaker 0: The music has never been bad in any final fantasy that I know of.

556
00:32:36,152 --> 00:32:40,666
Speaker 0: So how could they top that with also the best video game music ever?

557
00:32:40,686 --> 00:32:44,661
Speaker 0: I don't remember the guy's name, the guy who did the streets of rage music.

558
00:32:44,841 --> 00:32:45,964

00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:23,523
Speaker 1: look in that.

590
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:30,956
Speaker 1: But if you want us to release geek nights presents faster, share that shit around, unless it gets tens of thousands of views.

591
00:34:31,016 --> 00:34:31,438
Speaker 1: I'm doing it.

592
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,532
Speaker 1: And Scott's doing it as we damn well feel like.

593
00:34:34,592 --> 00:34:34,732
Speaker 1: Yeah.

594
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:41,405
Speaker 0: I mean, in general, we have this YouTube, we've been trying to break into the world of video cause podcasts, not so hot videos, pretty hot right now.

595
00:34:41,987 --> 00:34:44,620
Speaker 0: We're not that good at it, but we're practicing and getting better.

596
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:50,731
Speaker 1: So if you like our video stuff, share it because unless it starts getting a lot of views, we're not going to speed up the release cycle.

597
00:34:50,831 --> 00:34:51,132
Speaker 1: Yeah.

598
00:34:51,152 --> 00:34:55,092
Speaker 0: It's like, if you want us to do more, you got to watch it and get other people to watch it.

599
00:34:55,172 --> 00:35:00,960
Speaker 0: And we got to see the numbers go up and then we will have an incentive to make more and see if the numbers go up.

600
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:05,720
Speaker 1: So yo dogs post that shit on Reddit because I can't cause I'll get downvoted for self-promotion.

601
00:35:05,941 --> 00:35:06,201
Speaker 0: Yeah.

602
00:35:07,785 --> 00:35:08,166
Speaker 1: All right.

603
00:35:08,347 --> 00:35:08,688
Speaker 1: All right.

604
00:35:08,768 --> 00:35:20,710
Speaker 1: So internet governance don't want to talk about the details of the votes that just happened and all that complicated bullshit because the general question is actually something that there isn't a good answer for.

605
00:35:21,192 --> 00:35:22,920
Speaker 1: So the general case is worth discussing.

606
00:35:23,541 --> 00:35:24,786
Speaker 0: Who's the governor of the internet.

607
00:35:24,806 --> 00:35:24,986
Speaker 1: Yeah.

608
00:35:25,107 --> 00:35:36,726
Speaker 1: Who will, who decides who gets what IP address, who decides where the routers go, who pays for the transatlantic cable between like Australia and New Zealand?

609
00:35:36,746 --> 00:35:38,516
Speaker 0: Those are all different questions with different answers.

610
00:35:38,537 --> 00:35:39,782
Speaker 0: Why don't we stick with one at a time?

611
00:35:39,802 --> 00:35:40,525
Speaker 0: All right.

612
00:35:40,585 --> 00:35:42,451
Speaker 1: So don't DNS.

613
00:35:42,632 --> 00:35:43,595
Speaker 1: who controls that?

614
00:35:43,836 --> 00:35:45,924
Speaker 1: What if one country wants to do something different?

615
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:49,860
Speaker 1: What if Venezuela is mad about their TLD and they want a different one?

616
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,944
Speaker 1: Who do they complain to?

617
00:35:51,305 --> 00:35:53,072
Speaker 0: Well, here's the way it works right now, right?

618
00:35:53,213 --> 00:35:59,758
Speaker 0: Is anyone who owns a computer or hardware device can do whatever they wish with that device, right?

619
00:35:59,818 --> 00:36:05,442
Speaker 0: So if I'm some country, you know, and, uh, there's some internet, so I have to be connected to other countries.

620
00:36:05,482 --> 00:36:10,224
Speaker 0: Otherwise it's just going to be a big land and not an internet or it'll be on internet, but not the internet.

621
00:36:10,866 --> 00:36:11,930
Speaker 0: And it's just in my country.

622
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:16,809
Speaker 0: I want some other country too, because you know, right now the world is governed by countries.

623
00:36:16,869 --> 00:36:21,992
Speaker 0: So their law still stands for a lot of things, especially physical devices and physical locations.

624
00:36:22,012 --> 00:36:23,960
Speaker 0: who owns them, who is allowed to do things with them.

625
00:36:24,001 --> 00:36:25,126
Speaker 0: It's property law, right?

626
00:36:25,467 --> 00:36:26,230
Speaker 0: I own this computer.

627
00:36:26,371 --> 00:36:29,383
Speaker 0: I can make it do with bits, whatever I want it to do.

628
00:36:29,464 --> 00:36:32,213
Speaker 0: That's legal, you know, in this country to do with it.

629
00:36:33,096 --> 00:36:35,885
Speaker 0: So, but my country wants to connect with another country.

630
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:47,633
Speaker 1: So we need some sort of agreement between us to have this cable go and maybe that agreement often will be between, for example, two private entities that are high level to like, you know, high tier service providers.

631
00:36:47,653 --> 00:36:47,794
Speaker 1: Yeah.

632
00:36:47,874 --> 00:36:59,555
Speaker 0: And it's, you know, a lot of the same laws that are involved with say importer exporter will be involved in the cable going from chips us to exactly with the cable going from us to Canada.

633
00:36:59,755 --> 00:37:04,052
Speaker 0: You know, let's say it goes from sprint to Canadian phone company.

634
00:37:04,072 --> 00:37:05,799
Speaker 0: I don't know the name of right.

635
00:37:05,859 --> 00:37:07,546
Speaker 0: You know, those companies work it out.

636
00:37:07,667 --> 00:37:11,726
Speaker 0: There's some laws involving, you know, who's defending the cable in times of war, I guess.

637
00:37:11,766 --> 00:37:12,107
Speaker 0: I don't know.

638
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:14,719
Speaker 0: And they set it up and now they're sending bits.

639
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:31,817
Speaker 0: Well, what if Canada decides to make a law that they're going to do bits different, like reverse bits, the U S side either has to also do reverse bits or say flip, reverse all the bits going to Canada or coming from Canada or just say, fuck you Canada.

640
00:37:31,837 --> 00:37:34,450
Speaker 0: You're not doing things the way we do them and the way everyone else does them.

641
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:37,866
Speaker 0: So we're just going to cut your ass off and we're not going to accept your bits anymore.

642
00:37:38,668 --> 00:37:42,684
Speaker 1: Now, the reality is that the United States basically invented the internet.

643
00:37:42,704 --> 00:37:45,539
Speaker 1: It's like the last great thing we as a country spent tax dollars on.

644
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:47,850
Speaker 0: And we say the way the bits are going to go.

645
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:52,571
Speaker 0: And if someone doesn't make their bits go the way our bids go, they just don't have any working internet.

646
00:37:52,792 --> 00:37:57,830
Speaker 1: Basically right now, the U S department of effectively has control over the internet.

647
00:37:58,271 --> 00:38:01,122
Speaker 1: And while a lot of other countries might say they can control.

648
00:38:01,162 --> 00:38:09,822
Speaker 1: like China kind of has walled themselves off from the internet, a lot of other restrictive and or horrible countries have walled themselves off or attempted to wall themselves off.

649
00:38:09,963 --> 00:38:20,820
Speaker 1: North Korea doesn't really appear to have an internet, but the fact remains that the vast majority of pretty much everything is in the sphere of influence of the United States.

650
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:26,140
Speaker 1: And we have hitherto basically told the entire rest of the world to go fuck themselves.

651
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:26,680
Speaker 0: Good.

652
00:38:27,142 --> 00:38:30,998
Speaker 0: Now at the same time, not really good because, you know, even though I'm a U?

653
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,926
Speaker 0: S person, I live here, I was born here.

654
00:38:32,966 --> 00:38:33,448
Speaker 0: I've been here.

655
00:38:33,468 --> 00:38:37,726
Speaker 0: the over and over 99% of my life has been spent in this country, right?

656
00:38:38,208 --> 00:38:40,156
Speaker 0: I'm not always the biggest fan of this country.

657
00:38:40,176 --> 00:38:41,482
Speaker 0: We complain about it all the time.

658
00:38:41,582 --> 00:38:45,421
Speaker 0: Every country has a lot of bad shit and ours notwithstanding, we get a lot of bad shit here.

659
00:38:45,441 --> 00:38:51,603
Speaker 1: So we just had a huge mass shooting and the country flipped out about how we shouldn't talk about it.

660
00:38:51,764 --> 00:38:51,964
Speaker 0: Yeah.

661
00:38:52,045 --> 00:38:57,287
Speaker 0: Anyway, well, we've got a situation where, you know, should we really be in charge of this internet?

662
00:38:57,448 --> 00:38:59,400
Speaker 1: Our Congress can't figure out if they're going to pay back money.

663
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,666
Speaker 1: They already borrowed, right?

664
00:39:00,847 --> 00:39:09,343
Speaker 0: This internet is something that is important to the whole world, even though we invented it, or at least most of it, it is not something that really belongs to us entirely.

665
00:39:09,403 --> 00:39:12,514
Speaker 0: It's something that the entire world has a huge stake in.

666
00:39:12,895 --> 00:39:18,899
Speaker 0: So for one country to control it and do things in its own interest, you can see how that's not exactly fair or right.

667
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:22,133
Speaker 0: We could fuck over all these other countries and be evil in many ways.

668
00:39:22,173 --> 00:39:24,182
Speaker 0: And I, we recognize that that is not cool.

669
00:39:24,242 --> 00:39:24,463
Speaker 1: Yes.

670
00:39:24,583 --> 00:39:32,676
Speaker 1: Now at the same time, and this is why, you know, when it comes to politics, I take very nuanced and sometimes complicated positions and shows it.

671
00:39:32,716 --> 00:39:46,895
Speaker 1: So does Scott on most issues, but people would consider me perhaps left wing, liberal, radical, you know, but, uh, I'm actually very effectively right wing on the issue of internet governance.

672
00:39:47,497 --> 00:39:56,434
Speaker 1: I'm of the mind that the United States government should maintain its effective control over internet governance and furthermore should defend that if necessary with military force.

673
00:39:56,816 --> 00:39:57,036
Speaker 0: Yeah.

674
00:39:57,117 --> 00:39:59,024
Speaker 0: And because basically here's the situation, right?

675
00:39:59,687 --> 00:40:07,198
Speaker 0: It would be nice as I just said, if the whole world could come together to govern the internet in unison, the United nations, why don't we have them?

676
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:17,016
Speaker 0: And we could work together for everyone's interest in the internet and not just have the internet be serving of the U S and basically all these other countries while dependent on the internets.

677
00:40:17,859 --> 00:40:29,841
Speaker 0: Um, basically under our foot and basically needing, you know, us so badly because we run the show, it's not fair to them to not be able to have any control or say in this thing that is so important to them.

678
00:40:30,383 --> 00:40:42,782
Speaker 0: It's because up until now, if you look at reality, anything, the other countries of the world have wanted to do with the internet, if they had the power to do so are stupid things that they shouldn't do.

679
00:40:43,765 --> 00:40:53,160
Speaker 1: It basically is true that with a few exceptions, despite all the bullshit that goes on in the U S our freedom of speech is one of the few things that we really have going for us.

680
00:40:53,300 --> 00:41:02,749
Speaker 1: And unless copyright is involved, you can basically post anything, but the vast majority of the rest of the world would rather that not be the case.

681
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:19,661
Speaker 1: And if we let the United nations control the internet to the degree that many of its members now would like the people who are pushing for that, the more the most seem to be the countries that actually want to straight up restrict the thing the internet is the best at, which is sharing information in an unfettered manner.

682
00:41:20,564 --> 00:41:26,042
Speaker 0: The other thing is that a lot of these countries, you know, they view the internet as the web.

683
00:41:26,062 --> 00:41:28,394
Speaker 0: They don't have a technological view of it, right?

684
00:41:28,434 --> 00:41:32,091
Speaker 0: They're viewing like this surface level crap because they don't have a technological understanding.

685
00:41:32,131 --> 00:41:35,145
Speaker 0: They're politicians and diplomats and those sorts of people.

686
00:41:35,185 --> 00:41:38,561
Speaker 0: They don't, you know, most, almost all of them do not understand technology.

687
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:47,865
Speaker 0: So the things they want to do for purposes of censorship or spying or commerce or whatever they're, you know, all tear.

688
00:41:47,945 --> 00:42:00,883
Speaker 0: your old world motives are most likely most of those things will ruin the internet technologically and bit wise and performance wise and reliability wise and security wise.

689
00:42:01,425 --> 00:42:05,296
Speaker 0: And we cannot let any of those things happen for those reasons.

690
00:42:05,978 --> 00:42:13,570
Speaker 0: And you know, if there was some sort of elite panel of, you know, amazing technology, people who are going to run the internet, that would be totally chill.

691
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:21,863
Speaker 1: But now we've got a bunch of countries who want to basically make it illegal to blaspheme on the internet or to restrict things like Australia or Britain does.

692
00:42:22,023 --> 00:42:25,737
Speaker 1: And we just, the one thing we've got going for us is free speech.

693
00:42:26,058 --> 00:42:29,190
Speaker 1: And the other thing is that we've actually managed the internet pretty well.

694
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:29,853
Speaker 1: Yeah.

695
00:42:29,953 --> 00:42:46,548
Speaker 0: I mean, if you look, even though the US has done many things wrong up until now, at least, and so far no evidence of badness in the future, the things the US government has wanted and declared for the internet to do have mostly been good and the right thing to do.

696
00:42:46,769 --> 00:42:51,865
Speaker 0: And mostly in good, been better than anything any other country would have done if they were in charge.

697
00:42:52,668 --> 00:42:54,313
Speaker 0: So not going to complain yet.

698
00:42:54,474 --> 00:42:58,829
Speaker 0: If it has to be one country, this one has done a good job so far.

699
00:42:58,949 --> 00:43:03,344
Speaker 0: Let's stick with it until we can't stick with it anymore and then figure something else out.

700
00:43:04,468 --> 00:43:08,622
Speaker 1: So very recently is kind of an example of how this is making it to the news.

701
00:43:08,782 --> 00:43:16,716
Speaker 1: And it's interesting because most of the news coverage around this doesn't really even explain what, because journalists don't know anything about technology either.

702
00:43:16,797 --> 00:43:25,470
Speaker 1: So the ITU is a part of the United Nations that manages things like telecommunications between countries, like long distance phone calls and all that stuff.

703
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:25,691
Speaker 0: Yeah.

704
00:43:25,731 --> 00:43:27,800
Speaker 0: It's a very old organization.

705
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:30,850
Speaker 0: And for things like phone calls, it worked pretty well.

706
00:43:31,251 --> 00:43:38,920
Speaker 1: So the United States, there was a treaty that was put forth that would expand part of the ITU's purview to cover some internet things.

707
00:43:40,402 --> 00:43:45,939
Speaker 1: And US ambassador Terry Kramer basically told everyone, yeah, we're not signing it.

708
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:47,828
Speaker 1: And he gave a really good speech as to why.

709
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:49,637
Speaker 1: And I want to read the relevant quote here.

710
00:43:49,657 --> 00:43:58,349
Speaker 1: Quote, "The internet has given the world unimaginable economic and social benefits during these past 24 years, all without UN regulation.

711
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:04,371
Speaker 1: We candidly cannot support an ITU treaty that is inconsistent with a multi-stakeholder model of internet governance.

712
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:13,474
Speaker 1: These past two weeks, we have of course made good progress and shown willingness to negotiate on a variety of telecommunications policy issues, such as roaming and settlement, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

713
00:44:14,238 --> 00:44:18,260
Speaker 1: But the United States continues to believe that internet policy must be multi-stakeholder driven.

714
00:44:18,601 --> 00:44:25,125
Speaker 1: Internet policy should not be determined by member states, but by citizens, communities, and the broader society.

715
00:44:25,607 --> 00:44:29,081
Speaker 1: And that consultation from the private sector and civil society is paramount.

716
00:44:29,563 --> 00:44:30,605
Speaker 1: It has not happened

717
00:44:30,706 --> 00:44:31,067
Speaker 1: here.".

718
00:44:31,548 --> 00:44:32,811
Speaker 1: Referring to the ITU treaty.

719
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:41,237
Speaker 1: And he basically goes on to say that the people involved in making these treaties that we're currently refusing to sign.

720
00:44:41,257 --> 00:44:42,743
Speaker 1: Oh, there's a great quote here.

721
00:44:43,044 --> 00:44:51,716
Speaker 1: He warned, or another guy warned, "The US should immediately prepare for an even more treacherous ITU treaty negotiation that's going to take place in 2014 in

722
00:44:51,756 --> 00:44:51,937
Speaker 1: Korea.".

723
00:44:54,080 --> 00:45:01,694
Speaker 1: So the UN, different groups of countries keep getting together and trying to put forth resolutions, giving themselves more control over the internet.

724
00:45:01,975 --> 00:45:04,264
Speaker 1: And every time the US just says, "Well, you know what?

725
00:45:04,344 --> 00:45:04,545
Speaker 1: No.".

726
00:45:04,746 --> 00:45:06,294
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, think about it this way, right?

727
00:45:06,536 --> 00:45:10,188
Speaker 0: If you consider the internet as almost like a country, right?

728
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,091
Speaker 0: It's that important.

729
00:45:11,593 --> 00:45:15,385
Speaker 0: And its citizens are all sorts of people all over the world.

730
00:45:15,767 --> 00:45:22,855
Speaker 0: So this is like, you know, in the olden days of the US, only the white dudes who owned land and had penises could vote.

731
00:45:23,237 --> 00:45:29,419
Speaker 0: Well, this is like, well, this is internet and we're all live in it, but only the people who run countries can vote.

732
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,449
Speaker 0: It's like, no, that's not how it's got to work.

733
00:45:31,529 --> 00:45:31,629
Speaker 0: Yeah.

734
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:35,769
Speaker 1: I mean, the people who run Libya really don't want the people in Libya having access to the internet.

735
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:37,859
Speaker 0: The people who run China really don't want people.

736
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:42,315
Speaker 1: the people in China running it really don't want the people living in it.

737
00:45:42,415 --> 00:45:47,820
Speaker 0: Even in a situation like this is like corporations really depend on the internet to live all around the world.

738
00:45:48,341 --> 00:45:52,698
Speaker 0: And they don't even have a say in this ITU shit other than paying the government, right?

739
00:45:52,758 --> 00:46:06,384
Speaker 0: So governance, you know, people who own, you know, govern large pieces of land, you know, even if they represent their people should, you know, on paper should not be the ones to determine the policy of the internet.

740
00:46:06,444 --> 00:46:16,101
Speaker 0: It is, you know, we should instead imagine it as a separate country and anyone who uses or depends on the internet is a citizen of it and has an equal say to everyone else.

741
00:46:16,221 --> 00:46:21,641
Speaker 1: My fantasy depends on my fantasy that I know is not relevant for at least for the next day.

742
00:46:21,661 --> 00:46:24,031
Speaker 0: The internet is its own country.

743
00:46:24,172 --> 00:46:33,943
Speaker 1: My fantasy of the next few decades is that the internet is recognized by the United nations, probably out of necessity as a sovereign nation and has delegates

744
00:46:34,104 --> 00:46:40,309
Speaker 0: and the people who are in charge of the internet and are elected and in charge of it or whatever are really smart technological people.

745
00:46:40,369 --> 00:46:45,331
Speaker 0: And suddenly they person who's the head of that is more important than the president of the United States.

746
00:46:45,351 --> 00:46:53,428
Speaker 1: I have a feeling that that can only come to pass if the, if the people who consider themselves citizens of the internet, I mean, I consider myself personally, if they

747
00:46:53,468 --> 00:46:55,376
Speaker 0: had us, if they had New York city

748
00:46:55,496 --> 00:46:56,380
Speaker 1: and of the internet,

749
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:01,724
Speaker 0: if they had legit internet passports, like you could go to a country and say, you know, I'm from internet.

750
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:02,768
Speaker 0: That is my country.

751
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:04,815
Speaker 0: I would switch and get one.

752
00:47:04,836 --> 00:47:08,696
Speaker 1: I would say that internet would be, well, then again, what if you have to be super legit though?

753
00:47:08,716 --> 00:47:15,986
Speaker 0: It couldn't be like green card to live in the U S unless you were a dual citizen, but it would have to be super legit, not sea land legit, right?

754
00:47:16,026 --> 00:47:17,977
Speaker 0: So it would have to be as legit as a French pass.

755
00:47:18,017 --> 00:47:19,042
Speaker 1: It would have to be dual citizens.

756
00:47:19,083 --> 00:47:24,590
Speaker 1: just because as cool as this fantasy is, the fact remains that the one thing the internet does not have is sovereign land.

757
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:27,485
Speaker 1: So even if you're a citizen of the internet, you got to live in some other country.

758
00:47:27,505 --> 00:47:29,815
Speaker 1: Do you really want to have a green card to live here?

759
00:47:29,836 --> 00:47:45,346
Speaker 0: If it was, if the passport and the, you know, the citizenship was as legit as current citizenship is and not some sea land joke, like I said, I would do whatever I had to do to be that even if it meant green cards or whatever.

760
00:47:45,567 --> 00:47:45,808
Speaker 1: Is that?

761
00:47:45,848 --> 00:47:53,499
Speaker 1: the only way for the internet to have a legitimate sort of citizenship or recognition would be if it had the sort of independent ability to defend itself.

762
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,880
Speaker 1: Now you can imagine what that might entail.

763
00:48:00,622 --> 00:48:01,003
Speaker 0: Well, yeah.

764
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:07,265
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, like you said before, we should use military force to defend the internets if necessary.

765
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:17,441
Speaker 1: I have a feeling that if you know, the CBD TPA was basically fought off by the citizens of the internet from the era because normal people had no idea that that was happening.

766
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:24,005
Speaker 1: I know I bring that up a lot lately, but those kinds of laws keep trying to come back and we keep fighting them off.

767
00:48:24,085 --> 00:48:26,736
Speaker 1: But non nerds still have no idea this stuff happens.

768
00:48:27,539 --> 00:48:35,532
Speaker 1: If it, if it ever got to the point where stuff like that was about to pass, I think nerds would start doing the kinds of things that they were planning for in the nineties.

769
00:48:35,773 --> 00:48:41,051
Speaker 1: They'd start using PGP phone equivalents again and crazy encryption and dark nets.

770
00:48:41,773 --> 00:48:44,602
Speaker 0: There's only so much we can do along those lines.

771
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:48,317
Speaker 0: And we could be pushed to the point of using all of those tools, right.

772
00:48:48,338 --> 00:48:52,351
Speaker 0: And you know, doing lots and lots of, you know, internet side damage.

773
00:48:52,432 --> 00:49:02,449
Speaker 0: Basically, it's sort of like, uh, you know, if there is a war on the internet for the internet, it's going to look a lot like Russia retreating away from Napoleon and or Hitler.

774
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:13,458
Speaker 0: We're basically burning down the internet, uh, to damage those who were trying to harm the internet, to make them suffer in the land of the bad internet while simultaneously rotting around for ourselves who know better.

775
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:13,840
Speaker 0: Yes.

776
00:49:14,281 --> 00:49:18,978
Speaker 0: But in the end, the internet really does need physical defenses.

777
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:22,632
Speaker 0: I mean, it needs, the internet needs a Navy at the least to defend the undersea cables.

778
00:49:22,752 --> 00:49:27,187
Speaker 0: It needs some sort of space to put up and fix it.

779
00:49:27,428 --> 00:49:28,151
Speaker 1: Talk about this.

780
00:49:28,272 --> 00:49:32,952
Speaker 1: One thing that I could have, I wrote in high school, a short science fiction story that I can't find about.

781
00:49:33,173 --> 00:49:41,599
Speaker 1: And the idea was that the internet was recognized in some year, 20 X DX after a global act of pseudo terror to bay.

782
00:49:41,619 --> 00:49:52,900
Speaker 1: It was basically a threat from some form of anonymous to tell the world that they could, in fact, you know, people who are citizens of the internet in quotes had basically pervaded all levels of society.

783
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:58,384
Speaker 1: So you couldn't know who was or wasn't thanks to encrypted keys and anonymous stuff and all those sorts of things.

784
00:49:58,887 --> 00:50:00,840
Speaker 1: And I think that's, you know, my idea about the milk crates.

785
00:50:01,681 --> 00:50:15,202
Speaker 1: It's the idea that in every intersection of every major city in the world, citizens of the internet shoved shopping carts filled with gallons of milk into the intersection to stop all street traffic in every country in the world for one afternoon during rush hour to prove that it had the power to act if it needed to.

786
00:50:15,784 --> 00:50:20,475
Speaker 1: Hoping that that threat happens in that anime.

787
00:50:21,878 --> 00:50:28,094
Speaker 0: The one with the girl with the yellow door, a little bit of that action going on a little bit.

788
00:50:28,956 --> 00:50:29,297
Speaker 1: We'll see.

789
00:50:29,798 --> 00:50:35,161
Speaker 1: I think things like that will happen in our lifetime, but I think we're already too old to be on the forefront of that.

790
00:50:35,602 --> 00:50:41,968
Speaker 0: shopping carts aren't going to fix some someone cutting all the undersea cables either, which are surprisingly easy to cut.

791
00:50:42,008 --> 00:50:43,414
Speaker 0: They're cut all the time by accident.

792
00:50:43,574 --> 00:50:43,775
Speaker 0: Yeah.

793
00:50:44,317 --> 00:50:50,421
Speaker 1: But at the same time on the land and where you can have retransmitters, you can still keep the signals.

794
00:50:50,461 --> 00:50:51,706
Speaker 0: Well, that's another thing, right?

795
00:50:51,867 --> 00:51:08,407
Speaker 0: If there is sufficient technological innovation to where everything can be wireless and fast and affordable and et cetera, you have to get to the point to where a government cannot stop the internet without stopping all communication or this can't period.

796
00:51:08,447 --> 00:51:08,567
Speaker 0: Right.

797
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:14,470
Speaker 1: What if we reach a time where there is, it's always easier to disrupt a signal than it is to read it.

798
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:15,172
Speaker 0: That is true.

799
00:51:15,233 --> 00:51:22,662
Speaker 0: But what if there is, we can reach a point in time where we have technology such that, you know, we can, everyone just has their own power sources.

800
00:51:22,682 --> 00:51:24,207
Speaker 0: So it doesn't even matter if they cut the power.

801
00:51:24,428 --> 00:51:25,412
Speaker 0: Right.

802
00:51:25,432 --> 00:51:38,222
Speaker 0: And B everyone just wirelessly sending their own data and we can just, you know, use it every hell frequencies and shit we want, you know, crazy jamming, crazy noise, but that would require such an immense, well, no, that's what I'm saying.

803
00:51:38,263 --> 00:51:39,991
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter the resources it takes.

804
00:51:40,031 --> 00:51:46,636
Speaker 1: The idea is that you have to make the internet so integral to the real world in the day to day interactions of everything.

805
00:51:47,298 --> 00:51:56,351
Speaker 1: And at the same time, make it so resilient that the only way to stop, uh, the nerds who run the internet shadow, whatever, is to stop the entire internet.

806
00:51:56,612 --> 00:51:57,516
Speaker 1: That is all or nothing.

807
00:51:57,536 --> 00:52:04,564
Speaker 1: Because then basically it'd be like the equivalent of the only way to save New York city from the invasion is to nuke New York city.

808
00:52:04,684 --> 00:52:06,051
Speaker 0: Then they won't want it anymore.

809
00:52:06,152 --> 00:52:08,986
Speaker 0: And they'll realize how important New York was and why they shouldn't have fucked with it.

810
00:52:09,328 --> 00:52:13,228
Speaker 0: And then we, cause we're New Yorkers, we can put it back together once they get the hell out of here.

811
00:52:13,811 --> 00:52:16,462
Speaker 1: That's basically the only way the internet could be a sovereign power.

812
00:52:16,703 --> 00:52:16,964
Speaker 0: Yeah.

813
00:52:17,445 --> 00:52:20,052
Speaker 0: Well, maybe in our lives, maybe in the next lives.

814
00:52:20,072 --> 00:52:26,095
Speaker 1: We'll see what decade in terms of internet governance and we'll see what happens.

815
00:52:26,115 --> 00:52:28,586
Speaker 0: The fundamental point, at least for the short term is that the U?

816
00:52:29,048 --> 00:52:30,495
Speaker 1: S topic should be really boring.

817
00:52:30,535 --> 00:52:34,955
Speaker 1: It should be nerds just talking about, well, how do we allocate IP addresses in this country?

818
00:52:34,995 --> 00:52:39,558
Speaker 1: But instead we have countries like Korea being like, well, we don't want porn IP addresses and Germany.

819
00:52:39,578 --> 00:52:41,367
Speaker 0: Like we don't want any Nazi and Britain's

820
00:52:41,407 --> 00:52:43,497
Speaker 1: like, we want defamation laws like crazy

821
00:52:43,597 --> 00:52:52,700
Speaker 0: and people and other countries are like, well, you shouldn't be able to see anything that we don't like anywhere, or you should have to prove beyond any doubt that you're 18 plus in order to see any of this stuff.

822
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,892
Speaker 0: And it's like every computer must send bits.

823
00:52:56,992 --> 00:53:01,209
Speaker 0: It is asked to say, and if it wants to in any computer, then that is the problem.

824
00:53:01,249 --> 00:53:02,577
Speaker 0: We can't be looking at anyone's bits.

825
00:53:02,597 --> 00:53:03,743
Speaker 0: You can be blocking any internet.

826
00:53:03,783 --> 00:53:05,069
Speaker 1: Government should be boring.

827
00:53:05,169 --> 00:53:09,104
Speaker 1: It's not because people are stupid, greedy, drama filled and fearful.

828
00:53:09,184 --> 00:53:12,353
Speaker 0: It should just be as boring as, you know, here are computers.

829
00:53:15,381 --> 00:53:16,225
Speaker 0: They are not working.

830
00:53:16,285 --> 00:53:17,269
Speaker 0: Let us make them work.

831
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:17,772
Speaker 0: Okay.

832
00:53:17,812 --> 00:53:18,836
Speaker 0: They are now working.

833
00:53:18,957 --> 00:53:24,780
Speaker 1: So guys, do we add one bit or two bit to the new address scheme for IP 47?

834
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:34,605
Speaker 0: Uh, well it seems like we never thought we would need all the IP addresses of IPV six until every nanobot had an IP address.

835
00:53:34,646 --> 00:53:38,800
Speaker 1: And we made the nanobots should we use for the deep space network?

836
00:53:39,942 --> 00:53:43,533
Speaker 0: Think about farthest into the future as possible, right?

837
00:53:43,694 --> 00:53:46,603
Speaker 0: The smallest computer we can make will be half a quark.

838
00:53:46,985 --> 00:53:52,486
Speaker 0: If we computers are half a quark, we'll need this many bits to have an IP address for every half a quark computer.

839
00:53:52,787 --> 00:53:54,815
Speaker 0: Let's add two more bits to that.

840
00:53:54,835 --> 00:53:56,260
Speaker 0: So it will be super future.

841
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:01,337
Speaker 1: So everyone who isn't the U S you can help us administer the internet.

842
00:54:01,477 --> 00:54:08,730
Speaker 1: If we can get it to the point to where those kinds of discussions are literally the only discussions that happen in relation to the administration of the internet.

843
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:11,082
Speaker 0: Or if the U S starts fucking it up, which they haven't yet.

844
00:54:11,102 --> 00:54:12,749
Speaker 1: If the U S starts fucking it up, take it from us.

845
00:54:13,111 --> 00:54:13,653
Speaker 0: That's right.

846
00:54:14,859 --> 00:54:15,120
Speaker 0: Please.

847
00:54:22,411 --> 00:54:24,983
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

848
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:28,619
Speaker 1: Thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat Lee for web design and brand.

849
00:54:28,679 --> 00:54:28,980
Speaker 1: Okay.

850
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:29,864
