1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,745
Speaker 0: It's Monday November 15th, 2021.

2
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:12,206
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,927 --> 00:00:13,448
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,628 --> 00:00:14,789
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:20,137
Speaker 0: Tonight, we are talking about heating, ventilation, and air conditioning in homes.

6
00:00:20,557 --> 00:00:22,300
Speaker 0: That's a fascinating topic.

7
00:00:25,584 --> 00:00:26,314
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

8
00:00:28,783 --> 00:00:37,019
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we over here in New York We decided to actually go outside and go places where there were people and do stuff.

9
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:40,874
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we're gonna see if we face any consequences for that.

10
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:47,539
Speaker 0: With prudence and caution I like how you and your plan to go to that hockey game was very similar to our plan of all.

11
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:55,454
Speaker 0: right We're gonna go but we'll go scope it out and at any point We both reserve the right to call bail and we'll just bail immediately.

12
00:00:55,574 --> 00:00:57,260
Speaker 1: Before we went to the hockey game, right?

13
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:10,244
Speaker 1: We bought tickets to this basically dance party Months and months and months ago and things were looking good and it was coming up and it was happening and we're like.

14
00:01:10,285 --> 00:01:11,188
Speaker 1: well, should we go?

15
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:18,557
Speaker 1: because it was you know, one of the one of the Musicians, well, I guess not musician producer DJ, whatever, right?

16
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,680
Speaker 1: One of the people was someone that I was going to see years ago and they failed to come.

17
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:26,813
Speaker 1: I think it might have been for work visa reasons.

18
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:27,860
Speaker 1: They failed that other time.

19
00:01:29,164 --> 00:01:35,738
Speaker 1: So I really wanted to see them and under normal circumstances I would have been like, oh, yeah I really want to go way bad, right?

20
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,860
Speaker 1: But obviously I didn't want us to go so bad I would die.

21
00:01:41,261 --> 00:01:45,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean we made we made a lot of tentative plans before the uptick happened.

22
00:01:47,184 --> 00:01:50,426
Speaker 1: Yeah So we decided we're like, you know what?

23
00:01:50,606 --> 00:01:53,856
Speaker 1: All right, you know, let's we'll go and we can leave.

24
00:01:54,217 --> 00:01:55,100
Speaker 1: no one's keeping us there.

25
00:01:55,602 --> 00:01:59,119
Speaker 1: Right, if we don't like the looks of things we can go we don't have to stay there.

26
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:06,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's at a venue we'd been to before and we said, you know, we know that venue We could sort of stay in further in the back.

27
00:02:06,131 --> 00:02:09,032
Speaker 1: We don't have to go in the crowd in the front No one's making us do that.

28
00:02:11,102 --> 00:02:14,419
Speaker 1: So we went and they were very smart at the venue.

29
00:02:15,581 --> 00:02:19,260
Speaker 1: They were basically, you know, you get in line at a concert place, right?

30
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,551
Speaker 1: And then at the front is security and then tickets and then inside right?

31
00:02:22,953 --> 00:02:26,526
Speaker 1: Well, they actually did the vaccine checks At the back of the line.

32
00:02:26,566 --> 00:02:32,869
Speaker 1: So as you got in the line, which wasn't even moving yet They were checking your ID and your vaccine thing.

33
00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:41,270
Speaker 1: careful that and then they gave a wristband that not only had a color But was had the name of the venue printed on it.

34
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,580
Speaker 1: So there's no way anyone was gonna fake one of those, right?

35
00:02:46,882 --> 00:02:58,353
Speaker 0: So, I guess you have to fake your you know Excelsior pass or whatever, yeah, which Not impossible, but I feel like that is actually a high bar for the kind of person who refuses to get the vaccine at this point.

36
00:02:59,401 --> 00:03:03,015
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway, but we went inside and we you know, we're like up.

37
00:03:03,055 --> 00:03:03,758
Speaker 1: Should we leave?

38
00:03:03,798 --> 00:03:04,320
Speaker 1: Should we stay?

39
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,272
Speaker 1: We just stayed the whole time because it was too good.

40
00:03:06,293 --> 00:03:11,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Then we went to the hockey game yesterday, which you know.

41
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,996
Speaker 1: Similar situation and it's like well, you know, we similar.

42
00:03:16,016 --> 00:03:16,559
Speaker 1: now we're good.

43
00:03:16,619 --> 00:03:18,808
Speaker 1: now We're gonna stay inside and see what happens.

44
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:21,740
Speaker 0: Yep, the the next the the next fraud.

45
00:03:21,841 --> 00:03:30,890
Speaker 0: We'd only did this once the whole quarantine and we did it like last week But we ate indoors once when the huntress was completely empty like there was no one there.

46
00:03:32,105 --> 00:03:34,306
Speaker 0: Okay But we still have.

47
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:40,553
Speaker 1: he ate at the ramen place inside But it was the whole front of the place was completely open.

48
00:03:40,673 --> 00:03:53,972
Speaker 0: Yeah, like that and we just happened to be Hunter says those giant the threshold Giant windows where basically if you're sitting by those windows It's not materially different from being on the other side of those windows, right?

49
00:03:54,374 --> 00:03:56,862
Speaker 1: But yeah, here's here's the math on this situation Right.

50
00:03:56,902 --> 00:04:05,700
Speaker 1: So in New York City, there's like over eight million people Right, and there are about a thousand cases a day right now in the city.

51
00:04:06,382 --> 00:04:08,569
Speaker 1: So what's one thousand out of eight million?

52
00:04:08,589 --> 00:04:11,840
Speaker 0: Well, that is a hundred out of eight hundred thousand.

53
00:04:12,746 --> 00:04:22,053
Speaker 1: That is ten out of eighty thousand Right, so it's 0.01 to five for not it's not even one percent.

54
00:04:22,113 --> 00:04:24,840
Speaker 1: It's 0.01 to five percent, right?

55
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:32,480
Speaker 1: So the capacity right of the concert venue was three hundred about three or four hundred, right?

56
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:38,158
Speaker 1: So even we say four hundred right, that means five.

57
00:04:39,537 --> 00:04:44,459
Speaker 1: Uh No 0.05. so less than one person there had it.

58
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:58,820
Speaker 0: Well, I guess there's also that's like there's a big difference between going to an event with a number of people that lasts like one night Versus like going to a convention where 20,000 people shuffle in and out over the course of like multiple days

59
00:04:59,701 --> 00:05:01,284
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Madison Square Garden.

60
00:05:01,304 --> 00:05:03,287
Speaker 1: It's the capacity is like 20,000, right?

61
00:05:03,307 --> 00:05:12,694
Speaker 1: Yep, so It's like that's point oh oh oh one times 20.

62
00:05:12,694 --> 00:05:19,290
Speaker 1: So two people at Madison Square Garden Likely are sick today, right mathematically speaking.

63
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:25,770
Speaker 1: So it's like the you know in New York State wide the chart is starting to go up in a bad way.

64
00:05:26,512 --> 00:05:31,666
Speaker 1: But if you look at the the maps, it's mostly outside the city that it's that's happening in the city.

65
00:05:31,786 --> 00:05:37,390
Speaker 1: It's sort of holding flat and Which which me and these events like the ones we went to are happening.

66
00:05:37,893 --> 00:05:43,176
Speaker 1: So there there may be spreading going on at these events But they're not super spreading at these.

67
00:05:43,196 --> 00:05:58,830
Speaker 0: from what I've read most of the spread in New York City is localized to a small number of neighborhoods with a bunch of conflating factors and It's primarily among the unvaccinated and children going to school, right but mathematically speaking, right?

68
00:05:59,071 --> 00:06:16,499
Speaker 1: You know if you if you randomly distribute the all those cases across all the people in New York Right, that means that of all the people who are at the cocky game last night two of them are gonna go tomorrow and have positive tests, so I think that's okay, right?

69
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:17,926
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're vaccinated.

70
00:06:18,368 --> 00:06:18,730
Speaker 1: We'll see.

71
00:06:19,331 --> 00:06:24,044
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm still taking the prudent like cautious optimism and that I'm not.

72
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:24,505
Speaker 0: I'm still.

73
00:06:24,525 --> 00:06:27,337
Speaker 0: we're gonna avoid like anything We don't care a lot about.

74
00:06:27,417 --> 00:06:30,416
Speaker 0: obviously we can defer like I'm not gonna go to something I'm not that excited about.

75
00:06:30,798 --> 00:06:32,849
Speaker 0: so we're doing a lot less like we're not gonna try.

76
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,147
Speaker 1: I think also, you know, it's like a hockey game, right?

77
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:40,549
Speaker 1: It's like yeah There's a lot of people there, but you're only in close contact with the people you're sitting near right?

78
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:54,842
Speaker 1: Yeah, whereas if you go to a convention you're walking around and you know for days Right walking around walking around walking around, you know in different areas different rooms Touching stuff.

79
00:06:55,505 --> 00:06:58,134
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, even though even though kovat you don't get it from touching stuff.

80
00:06:58,154 --> 00:06:59,639
Speaker 1: You can get other things from touching stuff.

81
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:03,160
Speaker 0: So yeah, it's a it's the cautious reopening.

82
00:07:03,301 --> 00:07:07,255
Speaker 0: but at least the hockey game we went to was great because we just crushed him the high.

83
00:07:07,295 --> 00:07:11,420
Speaker 0: the one game and the one game you Went to ended up being the the first shootout of the season.

84
00:07:11,782 --> 00:07:14,174
Speaker 1: It was a long seven or eight rounds of shoot.

85
00:07:14,194 --> 00:07:15,400
Speaker 0: I was a long shootout.

86
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,534
Speaker 0: That was a. that was a tense game to watch from home.

87
00:07:19,554 --> 00:07:21,340
Speaker 0: so I can imagine what it was like in the garden.

88
00:07:22,244 --> 00:07:25,519
Speaker 0: We could hear the crowd to the booze every time.

89
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:34,311
Speaker 1: Yeah, people, you know people have to boo PK Subban And it is true that by coincidence or not.

90
00:07:34,993 --> 00:07:37,480
Speaker 1: He happens to be near other players.

91
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:38,947
Speaker 1: Well, they get injured.

92
00:07:38,967 --> 00:07:41,660
Speaker 0: there were two other than there was the thing that happened of a couple weeks ago.

93
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,300
Speaker 0: There was a sleuthing it where he slew footed someone like straight up and he has a history of doing that.

94
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,549
Speaker 0: Specifically though the video in this case from home.

95
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,240
Speaker 0: It didn't look like it was intentional, but he just happened to be there.

96
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,506
Speaker 0: Yeah, he just did just happen.

97
00:07:54,526 --> 00:07:57,299
Speaker 1: not a penalty to be near someone while they get hurt.

98
00:07:57,781 --> 00:08:03,598
Speaker 0: It's like Isis slippery, but it was unfortunate that he had just slew footage someone like for real recently.

99
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:08,216
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, but it's like I don't you know, I don't hate PK Subban like other people do.

100
00:08:08,457 --> 00:08:10,042
Speaker 1: Yeah, he seems cool You know, he's.

101
00:08:10,103 --> 00:08:16,660
Speaker 1: he's outspoken dude as opposed, you know and an out there guy as opposed to one of those normal You know, but I guess business.

102
00:08:17,945 --> 00:08:21,780
Speaker 0: Did they show a lot of replays of the the injury at the garden?

103
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,242
Speaker 1: We saw it.

104
00:08:22,282 --> 00:08:25,660
Speaker 0: we saw a replay of it because on TV they kept showing it for the whole rest of the game.

105
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,090
Speaker 0: They kept cutting back to it and slow it.

106
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,339
Speaker 0: It's showing it in slow-mo new.

107
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,092
Speaker 1: Okay, we only saw it like, you know immediately after it happened.

108
00:08:32,153 --> 00:08:33,580
Speaker 1: We saw it a couple times and that was it.

109
00:08:33,821 --> 00:08:35,668
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was a good OT.

110
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:36,993
Speaker 0: But anyway enough hockey talk.

111
00:08:37,013 --> 00:08:37,937
Speaker 0: Let's get into a Monday.

112
00:08:37,957 --> 00:08:50,376
Speaker 0: There's a lot of stuff We got to cover so briefly the Governments in the US is Incapable of dealing with like the telephone network and spam calls like they just can't.

113
00:08:50,837 --> 00:08:55,580
Speaker 0: but New York State has been moving faster than a lot of the rest of the country.

114
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,853
Speaker 1: What can what can a state do about the phone network?

115
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,540
Speaker 1: I don't think the state had any power over that.

116
00:09:00,761 --> 00:09:01,867
Speaker 1: I thought it's an FCC deal.

117
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:02,711
Speaker 0: Ah, it's.

118
00:09:02,892 --> 00:09:04,280
Speaker 0: it's actually really complicated.

119
00:09:04,421 --> 00:09:17,715
Speaker 0: So basically our new governor because we kicked out Cuomo Signed two New York State bills aimed at cracking down on robo calls Basically enabled by some things that the feds have done recently.

120
00:09:17,735 --> 00:09:22,500
Speaker 0: There was that federal rule I think it's the acronyms funny yet stir and shaken.

121
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:35,420
Speaker 0: There's a new set of federal rules that give carriers like more ability to do things that they weren't allowed to do before like Not to get into all the details of these laws because you can just read them and I'm not an expert on this by any.

122
00:09:35,801 --> 00:09:38,049
Speaker 0: But the best way to analogize it is.

123
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:46,100
Speaker 0: the reason email spam was destroyed is That people who sell email can basically do whatever the fuck they want.

124
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:49,092
Speaker 0: So a company like Google could just be like, you know what if you're?

125
00:09:49,112 --> 00:09:54,855
Speaker 0: if we don't know who your email server is We're just gonna ignore emails you send to anyone on our network.

126
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:55,577
Speaker 0: What are you gonna do?

127
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,079
Speaker 0: sue us?

128
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,393
Speaker 1: Right telephones are different because of accessibility and you know, it's a utility.

129
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:06,011
Speaker 1: You can't deny phone service to somebody Because it's like it's almost.

130
00:10:06,051 --> 00:10:07,679
Speaker 1: it's not a right but it's you know.

131
00:10:09,063 --> 00:10:27,176
Speaker 0: So the first law that our governor is signed basically in codifies and enables New York State enforcement of that federal rule and the second legislation Actually gives the New York State Public Service Commission the authority to oversee compliance with this.

132
00:10:27,556 --> 00:10:35,480
Speaker 0: so they can go after companies That robocall a New Yorker and they can go after a company that's in New York that is benefiting from robo calling.

133
00:10:36,304 --> 00:10:36,826
Speaker 1: I know you could.

134
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,860
Speaker 1: they could definitely go after companies in New York that are doing robo calling.

135
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,260
Speaker 1: That's a hundred percent easy, but I someone who you know robo calls into New York from elsewhere.

136
00:10:45,401 --> 00:10:47,653
Speaker 1: How could you know, I don't know if they could do anything about.

137
00:10:47,754 --> 00:10:48,920
Speaker 0: it depends the federal.

138
00:10:49,121 --> 00:10:51,196
Speaker 0: the federal actions seem to enable a lot of this.

139
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:53,705
Speaker 0: but The news here is

140
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:56,760
Speaker 1: not so much filtering phone calls at its borders

141
00:10:57,282 --> 00:11:16,075
Speaker 0: No, but companies in New York with these bills and with what they enable will Effectively start to have a framework on when they should block things and when they shouldn't block things Yeah Instead of just leaving it entirely up to their discretion Which is kind of how the federal rules play out because the federal

142
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:16,979
Speaker 1: rules are never a place.

143
00:11:17,402 --> 00:11:22,532
Speaker 1: that was New York was never a place where it has been profitable to run a robo call business.

144
00:11:22,613 --> 00:11:30,820
Speaker 0: from now all these scams are run through American red states that have no regulations or in fact, I thought there was like a place in Utah where it happens.

145
00:11:31,003 --> 00:11:31,900
Speaker 0: There's a few places.

146
00:11:32,463 --> 00:11:42,687
Speaker 0: When I was running afoul of this pot at my previous company one of my early things that I did at my previous company is I set up our like Telephone network for the service team.

147
00:11:42,747 --> 00:11:45,659
Speaker 0: I just did it myself because I still knew the phone network at the time.

148
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:53,920
Speaker 0: and Yeah, I bought a whole bunch of phone numbers through some shit-ass company in Texas that clearly also sells to scammers and spammers.

149
00:11:54,161 --> 00:11:59,339
Speaker 0: But they were real cheap and they gave me a ton of phone numbers from all over the world that a hundred percent worked.

150
00:12:01,302 --> 00:12:02,730
Speaker 0: But anyway, the the news.

151
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:07,734
Speaker 0: the reason I'm talking about this is that It is too late to save the phone number.

152
00:12:07,996 --> 00:12:13,045
Speaker 0: in my estimation Everything that's happening now is Way too late.

153
00:12:13,246 --> 00:12:14,532
Speaker 0: I think phone numbers are just dead.

154
00:12:14,854 --> 00:12:15,959
Speaker 0: young people will not use them.

155
00:12:17,061 --> 00:12:30,460
Speaker 0: I do not think the US federal government is capable of taking enough action to save the concept of a phone number Short of phone numbers that are only able to be used by an allow list of specific people in your contacts.

156
00:12:31,022 --> 00:12:33,611
Speaker 0: I don't think young people will ever answer the phone again.

157
00:12:33,631 --> 00:12:35,718
Speaker 0: I think that ship has sailed and it's fucked.

158
00:12:37,521 --> 00:12:43,959
Speaker 1: You know, we could do is you could make basically right a second phone network.

159
00:12:44,852 --> 00:12:49,380
Speaker 0: We could IP enabled you driven like right email like work.

160
00:12:49,863 --> 00:12:52,280
Speaker 1: The current phone network is largely IP enabled, right?

161
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:58,863
Speaker 1: But you can basically make a new phone network and everyone has an account on it and their phone number is like an alias on Their account.

162
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:07,957
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then you create a gateway to the old phone network Right, and then you filter hardcore on that gateway and eventually deprecate it the way they deprecated.

163
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:09,900
Speaker 1: broadcast television Oh, oh, yeah.

164
00:13:10,865 --> 00:13:16,820
Speaker 0: the the technical Solutions and the organizational solutions to this are easy and obvious.

165
00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:22,280
Speaker 0: The problem is our laws and regulations will never even remotely get close to making that happen.

166
00:13:23,181 --> 00:13:30,428
Speaker 0: Anyway, actually the listener points out that even in countries with more enlightened Governments, they can't solve this either.

167
00:13:30,468 --> 00:13:34,080
Speaker 0: in France robocalls are just as bad like bones are just broken globally.

168
00:13:34,361 --> 00:13:37,340
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, sir, your refrigerator warranty.

169
00:13:38,362 --> 00:13:43,080
Speaker 0: We're gonna talk about France again next week on Thursday because there's the news I was saving.

170
00:13:43,581 --> 00:13:46,329
Speaker 0: There is an official which that matters in French.

171
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,579
Speaker 0: French is a prescriptive language gender-neutral pronoun for the first time.

172
00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:50,813
Speaker 0: Okay.

173
00:13:50,976 --> 00:13:55,226
Speaker 0: Yeah All right, instead of eeler L. It's yell All right.

174
00:13:55,488 --> 00:13:57,460
Speaker 1: I didn't know what any of the pronouns in French were.

175
00:13:57,525 --> 00:14:08,972
Speaker 0: Yeah the problem is that doesn't solve a lot because adjectives have to be gendered to their what they're talking about and there's no Way to generically general gender neutralize those.

176
00:14:09,072 --> 00:14:11,560
Speaker 0: so this is like a tiny step, but it's also a big step.

177
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,500
Speaker 0: But anyway, that's the news for next Thursday.

178
00:14:14,081 --> 00:14:16,480
Speaker 0: But yeah, you can read about this if you want to see the details.

179
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,555
Speaker 0: But honestly do what everyone is doing in the rest of the world.

180
00:14:20,976 --> 00:14:24,454
Speaker 0: block any phone number That's not in your contacts and just never look back.

181
00:14:24,534 --> 00:14:25,218
Speaker 0: Just embrace it.

182
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:27,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean phones have that feature.

183
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,566
Speaker 1: I feel like that's all you need.

184
00:14:28,606 --> 00:14:33,915
Speaker 1: right anyone else is either not gonna leave a voicemail or Okay, a spam leaves a voicemail once in a while.

185
00:14:33,935 --> 00:14:34,760
Speaker 1: It doesn't happen that often.

186
00:14:36,545 --> 00:14:38,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, so, uh, yeah, you got some news.

187
00:14:38,882 --> 00:14:46,458
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Microsoft this is a bunch of articles today and at least two different sites talking about this Microsoft edge deflector thing.

188
00:14:47,544 --> 00:14:49,642
Speaker 1: so basically What the?

189
00:14:49,843 --> 00:14:54,184
Speaker 1: I tried to figure out what everyone is complaining about because they're like, oh my god It's gonna be.

190
00:14:54,305 --> 00:15:01,298
Speaker 1: they're like they seemed really You know like it was a big deal that you wouldn't be able to change your default browser away from Microsoft edge.

191
00:15:01,378 --> 00:15:01,740
Speaker 1: and I'm like.

192
00:15:02,283 --> 00:15:10,402
Speaker 1: I'm using the newest Windows 11 stable and I've got Firefox and I set it to default browser the same normal way You always do.

193
00:15:10,422 --> 00:15:13,672
Speaker 1: yeah, and it's sure as hell is my default browser.

194
00:15:13,692 --> 00:15:16,140
Speaker 1: I've edge like I just on there.

195
00:15:16,827 --> 00:15:19,887
Speaker 1: I've used edge Intentionally a couple times.

196
00:15:19,968 --> 00:15:27,532
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it is never once opened without me Pressing and typing in edge and pressing enter and wanting to open it.

197
00:15:27,773 --> 00:15:30,669
Speaker 1: I've never liked and I don't use ever Like.

198
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,717
Speaker 0: I have typed E-d and that's good enough.

199
00:15:33,737 --> 00:15:44,920
Speaker 1: Yeah I Usually use that what I want to use like not private browsing but that you know, not Firefox.

200
00:15:45,722 --> 00:15:47,928
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there is.

201
00:15:48,108 --> 00:15:49,191
Speaker 1: it's rare, but it happens.

202
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:52,380
Speaker 1: But regardless I've never used any edge deflector anything.

203
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,513
Speaker 1: So I'm like what the hell are these people complaining about?

204
00:15:54,835 --> 00:15:55,016
Speaker 1: Right?

205
00:15:55,036 --> 00:15:58,875
Speaker 0: Yeah I was search results from the start menu.

206
00:15:58,916 --> 00:15:59,860
Speaker 0: When did that right?

207
00:16:00,281 --> 00:16:16,420
Speaker 1: So it turns out that the only place that this is an issue that I could find in Windows 11 is if you Open the start menu and type in a search a web search and click web So that you're searching the web instead of searching your start menu and you click it.

208
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,260
Speaker 1: What it'll do is it'll embed Bing results in your start menu.

209
00:16:20,865 --> 00:16:26,131
Speaker 1: And if you click on those well That's actually clearly that little embedded Bing results in the start menu.

210
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,558
Speaker 1: is the edge browser embedded in the start menu.

211
00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:31,426
Speaker 1: Yep And then you click on those.

212
00:16:31,587 --> 00:16:35,060
Speaker 1: obviously it's gonna open edge because you just clicked on a link that was already in edge.

213
00:16:35,141 --> 00:16:36,030
Speaker 1: It's an embedded edge.

214
00:16:36,576 --> 00:16:46,240
Speaker 1: So Yeah, if I click a Firefox link, even if it's not my default browser It would still open in Firefox if I click on a Chrome link, even if Chrome's not my default browser opens a Chrome.

215
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:50,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you click an edge link, even though it's not edge isn't your default browser's gonna open an edge?

216
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:54,500
Speaker 1: So I don't see what the issue is there and also who the hell searches the web from there.

217
00:16:54,902 --> 00:16:59,180
Speaker 0: That's that's the underlying like the fact that edge deflect exists and all this whole discourse.

218
00:16:59,521 --> 00:17:02,250
Speaker 0: It took us both a minute to realize the fundamental problem.

219
00:17:02,511 --> 00:17:03,133
Speaker 0: the fuck.

220
00:17:03,434 --> 00:17:07,919
Speaker 0: if you're searching for a word Think of any word you might ever want to search for on earth.

221
00:17:08,521 --> 00:17:15,579
Speaker 0: Why would you want to see results from your local environment and from the internet at the same time?

222
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:16,481
Speaker 1: Right.

223
00:17:16,723 --> 00:17:19,220
Speaker 0: I think what I tell you tonight's into that thing.

224
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,640
Speaker 0: It's because I'm looking for like things called geek nights on my own fucking computer.

225
00:17:24,404 --> 00:17:26,856
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wish I could just remove web search from the start menu.

226
00:17:26,876 --> 00:17:27,599
Speaker 1: Why is it even there?

227
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,777
Speaker 1: If I'm typing something in the start menu, it's because I'm looking for an application to open.

228
00:17:31,937 --> 00:17:32,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not looking for.

229
00:17:33,461 --> 00:17:34,925
Speaker 1: I'm not looking for a website.

230
00:17:35,327 --> 00:17:36,370
Speaker 1: I do an application.

231
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,012
Speaker 1: I'm going to run.

232
00:17:37,032 --> 00:17:41,925
Speaker 0: I do look for folders that way but There aren't that many folders.

233
00:17:41,985 --> 00:17:45,720
Speaker 1: I hope it was a little bit Explorer and or a terminal to do that.

234
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:50,820
Speaker 0: Anyway, well a handful of folders like the geek nights folder is pinned there just shows up.

235
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,344
Speaker 0: There was a suggestion.

236
00:17:52,424 --> 00:18:04,608
Speaker 1: I was that there seemed to be some way that like Microsoft has some method to where Windows can force edge to open Rather than your default browser in certain instances.

237
00:18:05,149 --> 00:18:10,947
Speaker 1: So I think this might be like, you know, maybe you're doing some special Installation of something.

238
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:12,760
Speaker 1: I don't know but I've never seen it happen.

239
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:27,150
Speaker 1: But apparently they were saying it can happen that in some cases, you know Microsoft can make edge open instead of your default browser when clicking on something besides just the start menu case and I don't see what the fucking problem is.

240
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,477
Speaker 1: This is not a problem.

241
00:18:28,497 --> 00:18:29,060
Speaker 1: who gives a shit?

242
00:18:30,621 --> 00:18:34,673
Speaker 1: Yep, like I this is not article or or worry-worthy.

243
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,198
Speaker 1: Why are you everyone worrying about this?

244
00:18:36,218 --> 00:18:48,099
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, I'm trying to imagine the kind of person who wants to hit their start menu in their operating system and do a web search from there Specifically co-mingled with a search of their own computer.

245
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:52,889
Speaker 0: and It's tough because from the alternative perspective in a browser.

246
00:18:53,331 --> 00:19:00,349
Speaker 0: There was an era where the URL I'm not saying we should do this, but In the URL bar at the top.

247
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:06,149
Speaker 0: The only thing that used to take was a fully formed URL of a resource.

248
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:08,679
Speaker 1: you wanted to have one character wrong and it wouldn't work.

249
00:19:08,699 --> 00:19:24,088
Speaker 0: and If you wanted to search for something you typed in the URL of a search engine and then you type the search into that or You installed something that would do searches of web of like a Firefox Invented the or did Mozilla have it?

250
00:19:24,128 --> 00:19:27,320
Speaker 1: first the special Mozilla first the mycroft.

251
00:19:27,481 --> 00:19:30,835
Speaker 1: I think it's called the mycroft right that the top right the separate search box.

252
00:19:30,915 --> 00:19:39,472
Speaker 1: I used to use that a lot I'd and it's funny how much to make you'd have to program Little extensions for it to add more sites to the searching which I did.

253
00:19:39,492 --> 00:19:46,554
Speaker 0: Yep, but it's uh, it's funny How often I forget about those kinds of things that someone reminds me they existed.

254
00:19:46,615 --> 00:19:55,480
Speaker 0: like it's easy to forget What Windows 3.1 or like Windows 95 or early Firefox actually was like until you look at it and you remember all this weird shit.

255
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,851
Speaker 0: That just doesn't make sense to a modern eye.

256
00:19:58,232 --> 00:20:09,140
Speaker 0: So there was a transition where people Expected and like I do this now too if I'm searching for something on the internet I just type a bunch of words into that the one bar at the top of my browser and it just handles it.

257
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:10,324
Speaker 1: But you're not.

258
00:20:10,344 --> 00:20:13,778
Speaker 1: you're not expecting to search your desktop file system when you type in that bar.

259
00:20:14,139 --> 00:20:24,272
Speaker 0: true but I can see the slippery slope of like semantics where a Younger person would wonder if I type into the windows bar.

260
00:20:24,292 --> 00:20:25,596
Speaker 0: Why doesn't you just search everything?

261
00:20:26,398 --> 00:20:26,840
Speaker 0: I can see.

262
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:33,612
Speaker 1: Well, I think about it like an iOS or I assume Android but on iOS definitely, you know You do a little nudge downwards.

263
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:40,560
Speaker 1: you get that search box You type in searches up there and it searches like, you know the web and does like a Siri.

264
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:44,880
Speaker 1: It does like all these searches all at once and gives you one collective of results.

265
00:20:45,382 --> 00:20:46,627
Speaker 1: But it's like whenever I do that.

266
00:20:46,707 --> 00:20:49,960
Speaker 1: I'm always searching the name of an application that I know I already have installed.

267
00:20:50,202 --> 00:20:52,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, I never using that search for anything else ever.

268
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:54,140
Speaker 0: I don't know better had that or not?

269
00:20:54,180 --> 00:21:00,192
Speaker 0: Cuz what I had is I put I put the Google widget for a Google search at the top of my phone And you do that on iOS if you really want to.

270
00:21:00,212 --> 00:21:01,560
Speaker 0: well, but that's the only thing I ever used.

271
00:21:01,641 --> 00:21:02,969
Speaker 1: I never searched for the name of an app.

272
00:21:02,989 --> 00:21:08,580
Speaker 1: If I want to search the web on my phone I open up the browser first and then I type in the search in that box.

273
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:15,976
Speaker 1: I don't search the web just like with the the the Phone the iOS global search the iOS global search just like the start menu.

274
00:21:15,996 --> 00:21:20,600
Speaker 1: I'm searching for an app I have installed where the icon wasn't right in front of my face at that moment.

275
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:27,284
Speaker 0: So anyway, so in some other news, this is huge Huge news.

276
00:21:27,304 --> 00:21:30,195
Speaker 0: We're gonna have to talk about this on a future episode.

277
00:21:30,235 --> 00:21:32,732
Speaker 0: Maybe a Tuesday or Thursday But I'll just note it.

278
00:21:32,752 --> 00:21:39,283
Speaker 0: So Unity has acquired the digital side of Weta Mm-hmm.

279
00:21:39,303 --> 00:21:47,411
Speaker 1: So Weta was basically like the big 3d, you know production house that you know Peter Jackson Lord of the Rings, right?

280
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,356
Speaker 1: They made all that stuff.

281
00:21:48,879 --> 00:21:51,187
Speaker 1: So Unity is a game engine.

282
00:21:51,388 --> 00:21:54,620
Speaker 1: That's a cross-platform game engine that is ridiculously popular.

283
00:21:54,781 --> 00:22:03,268
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I think you know someone in our forum had the right call on this which is hey The Unreal Engine pretty much the direct competitor to unity.

284
00:22:03,428 --> 00:22:04,350
Speaker 1: right the big two.

285
00:22:06,843 --> 00:22:09,340
Speaker 1: The Unreal Engine is used for video games and movies.

286
00:22:09,753 --> 00:22:13,068
Speaker 0: Yeah well but especially with the Mandalorian and the volume.

287
00:22:13,108 --> 00:22:14,211
Speaker 0: that was the big transition.

288
00:22:14,231 --> 00:22:19,627
Speaker 0: where that is like the big use case is revolutionizing film creation.

289
00:22:19,687 --> 00:22:28,040
Speaker 0: right now is that combination of a real-time rendering engine like unity or like Like the Unreal Engine coupled with that physical technology of the volume.

290
00:22:28,702 --> 00:22:37,234
Speaker 1: Well, I mean the the crossover between the Hollywood and game industries, right, you know I've always in the past maybe like five plus years ago.

291
00:22:37,334 --> 00:22:42,430
Speaker 1: My gut was always telling me Hey all these triple-a video games you see them coming out.

292
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:46,140
Speaker 1: They're being made by people who couldn't get Hollywood jobs.

293
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:46,862
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

294
00:22:47,183 --> 00:22:49,891
Speaker 1: It's like some screenwriter who wanted to make a movie.

295
00:22:50,172 --> 00:22:52,980
Speaker 1: their script got used for a video game instead, right?

296
00:22:53,382 --> 00:23:08,520
Speaker 1: So, you know video games as a whole all entertainment software Doesn't have crossover with Hollywood, but the triple-a Fancy 3d big narrative games which are basically movies where you push buttons a couple times.

297
00:23:09,101 --> 00:23:12,892
Speaker 1: All right, those and Hollywood have major crossover.

298
00:23:12,912 --> 00:23:14,155
Speaker 1: That's only getting stronger.

299
00:23:14,175 --> 00:23:17,870
Speaker 0: I explained to capital markets people Constantly, they don't understand.

300
00:23:17,911 --> 00:23:19,640
Speaker 0: they think of games as a software company.

301
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:27,951
Speaker 0: Game companies are usually structured a lot more like movie studios and how they especially if you're building Your video game with an engine like you're using Unreal Engine.

302
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:30,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're buying most of the software, right?

303
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,879
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, you have to code stuff for sure, right?

304
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:38,620
Speaker 1: But you know, it's not like your ID where you're like, you know doom where your software company have to make a game engine.

305
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:45,660
Speaker 1: It's like you have the game engine, you know, most of the coding that you're doing is is you know specific to your content and not?

306
00:23:46,081 --> 00:23:52,460
Speaker 1: General software stuff, right, you know, so, you know, there are plenty of programming involved.

307
00:23:52,621 --> 00:23:56,279
Speaker 1: But it is not, you know, it's like this programming involved in making a movie, too.

308
00:23:57,042 --> 00:24:09,200
Speaker 0: But this is huge now because you've got unreal which was already in place to be used for this like Modern production pipeline, which again I cannot use as new unity now has both also.

309
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:15,990
Speaker 0: Yeah because you need he didn't have the kind of render pipeline you would need for that kind of work and This basically closes that gap.

310
00:24:16,714 --> 00:24:18,923
Speaker 0: their stock has Sky-rocketed.

311
00:24:19,284 --> 00:24:24,035
Speaker 0: I'm not giving investment advice, but I'll say this when the announcement happened.

312
00:24:24,236 --> 00:24:25,058
Speaker 0: I thought oh shit.

313
00:24:25,158 --> 00:24:26,060
Speaker 0: I should buy their stock.

314
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:28,914
Speaker 0: I looked like it already skyrocketed.

315
00:24:29,216 --> 00:24:32,560
Speaker 1: Oh too late Insider, you know insider trade needs to get it.

316
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:39,347
Speaker 0: So I decided well I'm not gonna jump on a fly like a high flying train because I I am More didn't it?

317
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,037
Speaker 0: I kept going every fucking day.

318
00:24:41,077 --> 00:24:41,500
Speaker 0: It's going up.

319
00:24:43,123 --> 00:24:44,569
Speaker 1: Well, the markets also a little bit up.

320
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:47,380
Speaker 1: No, this is this is like beat in the market by a lot.

321
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,849
Speaker 1: So my god, I didn't know.

322
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:50,753
Speaker 1: unity was public.

323
00:24:51,255 --> 00:24:53,204
Speaker 0: I Think I forgot.

324
00:24:53,224 --> 00:24:56,843
Speaker 0: I talked about that as news on geek nights Okay.

325
00:24:57,167 --> 00:25:01,394
Speaker 0: Anyway, uh My gut feeling is that what happened there?

326
00:25:01,997 --> 00:25:02,399
Speaker 0: is that?

327
00:25:03,303 --> 00:25:04,226
Speaker 0: This was announced.

328
00:25:04,486 --> 00:25:08,399
Speaker 0: so though like Wall Street thought Oh unity is important.

329
00:25:08,439 --> 00:25:10,699
Speaker 0: now I've heard of Weta and the stock went up.

330
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:19,980
Speaker 0: but then day by day people who actually Understand the ramifications of this have explained it to people and it just keeps going up as a result.

331
00:25:21,501 --> 00:25:23,487
Speaker 0: But yeah, I'm not giving investment advice.

332
00:25:23,507 --> 00:25:25,474
Speaker 0: I'm not saying whether or not I'm going to buy it.

333
00:25:25,574 --> 00:25:27,380
Speaker 0: I have not bought it yet again.

334
00:25:27,742 --> 00:25:31,824
Speaker 0: I'm not giving investment advice at all Have to make that clear.

335
00:25:32,385 --> 00:25:37,760
Speaker 1: but you definitely shouldn't take investment advice from rim because actually it peaked.

336
00:25:39,606 --> 00:25:40,238
Speaker 1: Oh, is that today?

337
00:25:41,481 --> 00:25:43,874
Speaker 1: It's gone down since it started going down today.

338
00:25:44,196 --> 00:25:44,940
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah a tiny bit.

339
00:25:45,062 --> 00:25:46,540
Speaker 0: It is you all those days.

340
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,432
Speaker 0: You could have bought it on the second or third day and still made a lot of money.

341
00:25:50,074 --> 00:25:54,430
Speaker 1: if you bought it like on the 10th Five days ago, right?

342
00:25:54,611 --> 00:25:55,475
Speaker 1: You would be up.

343
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:58,048
Speaker 1: Yep, like What's 160 versus like?

344
00:25:58,048 --> 00:26:00,344
Speaker 1: 200 right.

345
00:26:00,485 --> 00:26:05,951
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess I'll put it this way The thing does know about capital markets and stock price.

346
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:07,758
Speaker 0: is that by the time you?

347
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:16,300
Speaker 0: Without access to special information know about something to make a decision and you look at the price of a stock?

348
00:26:17,983 --> 00:26:23,891
Speaker 0: That stock price was determined by All of that knowledge and the knowledge you don't have already.

349
00:26:23,951 --> 00:26:28,932
Speaker 0: they what they say is everything you think you know is already Priced in to that value.

350
00:26:28,952 --> 00:26:29,334
Speaker 1: That's right.

351
00:26:29,716 --> 00:26:30,300
Speaker 1: That is correct.

352
00:26:30,581 --> 00:26:33,533
Speaker 0: And if it's not a real stock like it's some fake cryptocurrency bullshit.

353
00:26:33,894 --> 00:26:35,380
Speaker 0: that price is just fictitious anyway.

354
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:37,015
Speaker 0: But I digress don't buy NFTs.

355
00:26:37,035 --> 00:26:37,479
Speaker 0: They're a scam.

356
00:26:42,928 --> 00:26:45,406
Speaker 0: but anyway things Of the day.

357
00:26:45,426 --> 00:26:47,535
Speaker 0: This is a fascinating Twitter thread.

358
00:26:47,555 --> 00:26:48,379
Speaker 0: It's just really fun.

359
00:26:49,428 --> 00:27:02,926
Speaker 0: Emily Velasco was at some sort of thrift store and One of the Twitter threads she's showing pictures of all this really old like Busted technology that's just for sale.

360
00:27:02,946 --> 00:27:07,300
Speaker 0: They're like a credit card machine from the 90s like all sorts of weird nonsense.

361
00:27:07,781 --> 00:27:10,429
Speaker 0: But one of the things that was there was a fish finder.

362
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:13,920
Speaker 0: What are those like sonar driven fish finding devices?

363
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:14,961
Speaker 0: Like?

364
00:27:14,981 --> 00:27:15,442
Speaker 0: those are real.

365
00:27:15,502 --> 00:27:16,284
Speaker 0: those aren't woo like.

366
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:25,920
Speaker 1: they're just radar or sonar in this case like sometimes both like they work if you're doing Deep-sea fishing where you can't see the fish, and it's like you know you might just be sitting there if you act.

367
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,560
Speaker 1: You know if a lot of people go fishing they don't actually want to catch fish.

368
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:34,746
Speaker 1: They just want to sit on a boat right, but if you want to catch fish if your actual fisherman's your job It's like you need to know.

369
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,974
Speaker 1: like are there fish in this area at least?

370
00:27:37,094 --> 00:27:38,639
Speaker 1: or it's a fish finder?

371
00:27:39,302 --> 00:27:42,820
Speaker 0: So that one of these things was there a fancy one.

372
00:27:43,301 --> 00:27:49,200
Speaker 0: But Emily bought it because it looked like it had a full-on CRT in it.

373
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,208
Speaker 0: It was like a really expensive fancy one.

374
00:27:51,248 --> 00:27:51,870
Speaker 0: Just really old.

375
00:27:52,412 --> 00:27:58,010
Speaker 0: it in fact had one of those Hyper high quality orange phosphor CRT's.

376
00:27:58,551 --> 00:27:59,675
Speaker 1: so the orange only?

377
00:27:59,695 --> 00:28:01,580
Speaker 0: yeah orange only Maya.

378
00:28:02,561 --> 00:28:11,380
Speaker 0: So my first laptop the one that I had the first laptop I ever used that I'd like directly controlled that was given to me by work was given to me by IBM.

379
00:28:12,003 --> 00:28:14,578
Speaker 0: It was a 386 with an orange phosphor display.

380
00:28:15,563 --> 00:28:21,997
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was age used a lot of terminals that are like you know green But the orange ones always had a better contrast.

381
00:28:22,037 --> 00:28:27,043
Speaker 0: I didn't better Because they were more expensive way more expensive to make Orange.

382
00:28:27,184 --> 00:28:42,369
Speaker 0: orange phosphor was like the good shit, so this thread outlines this person Going through effort to figure out how to send signals to it and try to just like render shit on it and like draw stuff On the screen that was designed to

383
00:28:42,509 --> 00:28:45,776
Speaker 1: you know you don't want to use it as a fish finder a screens a screen Yeah Yeah.

384
00:28:46,522 --> 00:28:51,860
Speaker 0: and it is just a really fun thread of how she got this thing to work and the kinds of chips and tools and like.

385
00:28:52,422 --> 00:28:56,620
Speaker 0: But the saving grace like the way she was able to make all this work is that old technology?

386
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:03,258
Speaker 0: Like we talked about on a recent geek nights It's very well documented and the documentation was extremely specific.

387
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:09,200
Speaker 0: that Documentation plus an oscilloscope is all you need to drive this crazy proprietary display.

388
00:29:11,102 --> 00:29:15,660
Speaker 1: Knowledge yep, not well knowledge skill, but knowing how to not get killed by the touching the CRT.

389
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:20,663
Speaker 0: Yeah, but assuming you have all that the documentation Was enough.

390
00:29:20,883 --> 00:29:26,680
Speaker 0: without that documentation this would have been nothing a very difficult project if it ever would have been possible.

391
00:29:27,421 --> 00:29:31,780
Speaker 1: Yep, all right, so I posted about this at the forum, but why not?

392
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,359
Speaker 1: I'll use this thing of the day also because I'm low on things of the day.

393
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,875
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Adele the singer the famous one for a second.

394
00:29:38,895 --> 00:29:42,695
Speaker 0: I thought you were like Adele I thought you were gonna say computer, and then you pause.

395
00:29:42,715 --> 00:29:47,417
Speaker 1: my brain said well The singer recalibrating she's got she's got a new album.

396
00:29:47,437 --> 00:29:48,060
Speaker 1: It's a big deal.

397
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:57,875
Speaker 1: She's all over right now right selling all kinds of records making all kinds of money And she's way popular in South Korea where the kpop is Even though she's not Korean at all.

398
00:29:59,222 --> 00:30:02,834
Speaker 1: And they posted a promotional image that just said all it said on.

399
00:30:02,874 --> 00:30:03,676
Speaker 1: it was Adele.

400
00:30:03,937 --> 00:30:15,765
Speaker 1: it had a picture of her And it said MBC MBC not NBC MBC like moo That that's one of like the big TV stations You know broadcasting companies in Korea.

401
00:30:16,286 --> 00:30:31,579
Speaker 1: so from that image clearly she was gonna do some sort of television thing in Korea but The rumor spread that she was going to appear on show music core one of the you know kpop music shows.

402
00:30:31,699 --> 00:30:44,403
Speaker 1: now I've been watching kpop music shows for like almost 10 years and Never have I seen a worldwide famous act appear on any of those shows ever not even one time Right never?

403
00:30:44,544 --> 00:30:46,211
Speaker 1: that's like impossible right?

404
00:30:46,231 --> 00:30:50,980
Speaker 1: you would never see like fucking Drake on there What no matter how big their song was in Korea?

405
00:30:51,521 --> 00:31:02,043
Speaker 1: They might appear in like on Korean TV doing an interview or something But never on them actually performing on a music show not net can't happen Occasionally.

406
00:31:02,063 --> 00:31:05,180
Speaker 1: they'll have like at the end of year special festival.

407
00:31:05,565 --> 00:31:12,660
Speaker 1: They'll have like one Person they'll pay to come and there was a drama one time where they were gonna have Wiz Khalifa come and it fell apart.

408
00:31:12,941 --> 00:31:16,919
Speaker 1: It's like you know so they can't even pull it off when they pay for it sometimes.

409
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:26,507
Speaker 1: So if that rumor was true that was gonna be just unbelievable news like like the biggest deal ever right Turns out.

410
00:31:26,527 --> 00:31:27,132
Speaker 1: it was a rumor.

411
00:31:27,354 --> 00:31:27,939
Speaker 1: It's not true.

412
00:31:28,743 --> 00:31:39,019
Speaker 1: But because of that rumor you start asking some questions, and it's like well I've never seen anyone that famous on those music shows, but did it happen, and I missed it.

413
00:31:39,902 --> 00:31:40,965
Speaker 1: You know what is it?

414
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:42,931
Speaker 1: Maybe what if it did happen?

415
00:31:43,092 --> 00:31:44,015
Speaker 1: When did it happen?

416
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:45,620
Speaker 1: was it right?

417
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:46,984
Speaker 1: And you know it's turn.

418
00:31:47,064 --> 00:31:48,128
Speaker 1: It's not like I've watched this.

419
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,293
Speaker 1: these shows are on.

420
00:31:49,313 --> 00:31:51,020
Speaker 1: there's six different shows, right?

421
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:55,040
Speaker 1: They're on almost every single week unless they get canceled for some reason which happens occasionally.

422
00:31:56,042 --> 00:31:58,774
Speaker 1: Right it's like every day every week of the year.

423
00:31:58,794 --> 00:32:02,239
Speaker 1: It's like there's so many You're not gonna watch them all ever.

424
00:32:03,564 --> 00:32:05,779
Speaker 1: And it turns out through research.

425
00:32:06,644 --> 00:32:08,514
Speaker 1: Meaning reading the comments was my research.

426
00:32:08,534 --> 00:32:22,620
Speaker 1: I Discovered that in 2009 before I knew any fucking thing about kpop at all Lady gaga appeared on M countdown yeah for real, and I was like wow that's pretty amazing.

427
00:32:23,725 --> 00:32:27,922
Speaker 1: So there now you can watch that video from 2009.

428
00:32:27,922 --> 00:32:32,438
Speaker 0: God 2009 was a long time ago lady gaga who was real young.

429
00:32:32,478 --> 00:32:37,479
Speaker 1: in 2000 Specifically she was 12 years younger than she is.

430
00:32:43,312 --> 00:32:45,139
Speaker 0: Right in the meta moment we are.

431
00:32:46,103 --> 00:32:50,120
Speaker 0: Well, I am going to be live at PAX unplugged with a panel at 1 p.m.. On Friday.

432
00:32:50,464 --> 00:32:54,049
Speaker 0: I won't be at the con otherwise I'm rolling into in the battle and rolling right out.

433
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:58,769
Speaker 0: the book club book is still the tale of Genji Definitely happening at the end of the year.

434
00:32:58,789 --> 00:33:00,440
Speaker 0: We're both steamrolling through it lately.

435
00:33:01,321 --> 00:33:05,459
Speaker 1: If we don't do well if we don't get that book up of a so it out by the end of this year.

436
00:33:06,361 --> 00:33:08,318
Speaker 1: Then we'll just do it with wherever we're at.

437
00:33:09,581 --> 00:33:10,363
Speaker 0: I'm doing your thing.

438
00:33:10,403 --> 00:33:18,111
Speaker 0: I'm trying to take at least like one note about what interesting thing happened in each chapter or else I'm just not gonna forget everything.

439
00:33:18,151 --> 00:33:23,726
Speaker 0: I wanted to say about this fucking guy Yep So I yeah stay tuned for that.

440
00:33:23,746 --> 00:33:24,609
Speaker 0: that'll happen in December.

441
00:33:24,629 --> 00:33:27,620
Speaker 1: tax East got announced for for real.

442
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:42,780
Speaker 1: It's gonna happen in late April yeah, and they said that they're gonna have vaccine requirement, which is good Yeah, and they're gonna have mask requirement Which is you know good and not good because if an event's gonna happen I'd rather them do masking.

443
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:48,359
Speaker 0: But at the same time I would rather just wait myself until I don't have to wear a mask and masks are not.

444
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,370
Speaker 1: you Have some weird hang-up of where you're like.

445
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:55,844
Speaker 1: oh a mask is too uncomfortable me like a baby right Whereas me.

446
00:33:55,905 --> 00:33:57,071
Speaker 0: so you're going to faxes.

447
00:33:58,137 --> 00:34:06,039
Speaker 1: I don't know yet We'll see right, but you know my my stance is still what I've said all along Which is that if it is safe to go to PAX East?

448
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:15,007
Speaker 1: then It should be say you know if it's - if it's not safe enough to go to PAX East without masks That is it safe enough to go to PAX East at all?

449
00:34:15,188 --> 00:34:16,193
Speaker 1: question mark right.

450
00:34:16,614 --> 00:34:18,040
Speaker 1: is it safe enough to go on the airplane?

451
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,906
Speaker 1: Without every passenger wearing a parachute?

452
00:34:20,547 --> 00:34:22,895
Speaker 1: if it's not the plane might not be safe enough to fly.

453
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:23,958
Speaker 1: Let's just not even fly.

454
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,768
Speaker 1: so Well, we'll see what things are like in April.

455
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:29,899
Speaker 1: right it could be huge differences by then.

456
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:30,966
Speaker 1: right It's a long time from now.

457
00:34:31,045 --> 00:34:32,920
Speaker 0: so yeah, I'll probably do the thing.

458
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,760
Speaker 0: We'll put in panels like usual and we'll play it by air.

459
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,329
Speaker 0: We have a lot of time before we have to make.

460
00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:39,964
Speaker 1: the problem is if you put in a panel may accept it You can't bail.

461
00:34:39,984 --> 00:34:41,532
Speaker 0: well, but I would just do it like you.

462
00:34:41,552 --> 00:34:48,295
Speaker 0: remember I my last job I would go to Boston like every other week like just for a couple of meetings and back.

463
00:34:48,356 --> 00:34:50,284
Speaker 0: so I could just sell it To Boston.

464
00:34:50,304 --> 00:34:52,080
Speaker 0: do a panel or two and then a sell a home.

465
00:34:53,022 --> 00:34:54,112
Speaker 1: Yeah, do whatever you can do.

466
00:34:54,172 --> 00:34:54,657
Speaker 0: That's what I'm doing.

467
00:34:54,677 --> 00:34:58,540
Speaker 1: it unplugged Yeah, but yeah, we got everyone's got to make their own decision.

468
00:34:58,681 --> 00:34:59,464
Speaker 1: Yeah for themselves.

469
00:34:59,484 --> 00:35:05,519
Speaker 0: the thing is the thing to bear in mind like just there will be a future Where cons are just like you can go to them again?

470
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,333
Speaker 0: It's just we don't know exactly when that'll be.

471
00:35:08,675 --> 00:35:13,835
Speaker 0: we got to be cautious But I do look forward to a day when I'm out of packs playing games with some rando.

472
00:35:14,638 --> 00:35:19,130
Speaker 1: the question is How much industry will show up to PAX East?

473
00:35:19,632 --> 00:35:23,142
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz they killed back south Good.

474
00:35:23,503 --> 00:35:24,407
Speaker 0: Yep, justifiably.

475
00:35:24,467 --> 00:35:27,920
Speaker 0: I'm boycotting that state like in every possible way at this point.

476
00:35:29,485 --> 00:35:30,913
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we'll see and we'll see.

477
00:35:30,973 --> 00:35:35,873
Speaker 1: you know also like you know I just went outside for the fucking first time at least where other people were.

478
00:35:36,114 --> 00:35:37,158
Speaker 1: we'll see how that goes right.

479
00:35:37,198 --> 00:35:40,147
Speaker 1: if I get sick This week guess what?

480
00:35:40,448 --> 00:35:42,720
Speaker 0: Well, like I've been not gonna I have to go to work.

481
00:35:43,002 --> 00:35:44,733
Speaker 0: I have to go to my physical office three days a week.

482
00:35:44,753 --> 00:35:51,100
Speaker 0: Like that's the company policy I get to pick which days but up until now it hasn't been a big deal because I bike in both directions.

483
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,980
Speaker 0: It's almost too cold to bike to work.

484
00:35:54,060 --> 00:36:00,600
Speaker 0: So now I have to decide am I comfortable riding the subway twice a day three times a week as opposed to subway?

485
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,304
Speaker 1: It's not an issue.

486
00:36:01,344 --> 00:36:01,546
Speaker 1: I don't.

487
00:36:01,646 --> 00:36:03,658
Speaker 1: I've been taking the subway all whatever I've.

488
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,905
Speaker 0: Partly cuz I get afraid of this.

489
00:36:06,306 --> 00:36:08,434
Speaker 0: it's more than because I can city bike everywhere.

490
00:36:08,475 --> 00:36:09,820
Speaker 0: I just avoid the subway.

491
00:36:10,121 --> 00:36:16,329
Speaker 1: I've only read like if I could if I you know, if I it's like I'm not taking the subway, you know When there's an alternative, but I'm not.

492
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,494
Speaker 1: I'm not at this point.

493
00:36:17,555 --> 00:36:18,720
Speaker 1: It's like the subway or the bus.

494
00:36:18,861 --> 00:36:20,640
Speaker 1: It's like if you look at the numbers and other things.

495
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,379
Speaker 1: It's like there's not a lot of transmission going on in the buses and subways at all.

496
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:30,600
Speaker 0: Well, like earlier the one time we did a trip where we'd had to take a mass transit instead of just taking a private transport.

497
00:36:30,943 --> 00:36:31,287
Speaker 0: Well, I was.

498
00:36:31,367 --> 00:36:32,640
Speaker 0: it was still a more worrying time.

499
00:36:33,081 --> 00:36:40,919
Speaker 0: We did the private room on the Amtrak because I wouldn't have been willing to sit in like a dense train car at that time But it's way different now than it was then.

500
00:36:42,702 --> 00:36:48,959
Speaker 0: Also my calculus like for all of you But both of us our calculi are based heavily on the fact that we live in New York City.

501
00:36:49,782 --> 00:36:53,480
Speaker 0: Much of the rest of America is not even close to that safe right now.

502
00:36:54,401 --> 00:36:59,160
Speaker 0: Yep, like if I lived in most other places, I would be way more locked down than I am.

503
00:36:59,962 --> 00:37:03,292
Speaker 1: Yeah, some countries and places, you know think doing worse better.

504
00:37:03,533 --> 00:37:05,218
Speaker 0: Germany's getting pretty good weather report.

505
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:08,805
Speaker 0: Yeah So, all right, let's get into it.

506
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:09,427
Speaker 0: HVAC.

507
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:10,109
Speaker 0: we talked.

508
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:13,157
Speaker 0: we're not gonna talk about computer heating and cooling.

509
00:37:13,258 --> 00:37:14,080
Speaker 0: we've done that before.

510
00:37:14,563 --> 00:37:16,634
Speaker 0: We're not talking about server rooms.

511
00:37:16,855 --> 00:37:17,278
Speaker 0: We did that.

512
00:37:17,398 --> 00:37:21,458
Speaker 1: by that He means heating and cooling your computer not computers controlling the heating.

513
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:28,500
Speaker 0: Yes Yes, and we did a whole show in 2013 on cooling and like server rooms and data centers.

514
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:30,144
Speaker 0: Well, that's changed a lot.

515
00:37:30,245 --> 00:37:35,920
Speaker 0: That's not what we're talking about today talking about homes houses and apartments like regular-ass heating and cooling.

516
00:37:36,782 --> 00:37:45,960
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know too much about the subject But I do know how to discuss it in an entertaining fashion that is to talk about the original HVAC Which was sit around a fire.

517
00:37:46,621 --> 00:37:48,468
Speaker 1: Yep, there was no there was no AC.

518
00:37:48,589 --> 00:37:48,850
Speaker 1: Actually.

519
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,457
Speaker 1: It was just the H there.

520
00:37:50,598 --> 00:37:53,608
Speaker 0: actually Did I mean I guess original original.

521
00:37:53,668 --> 00:37:55,234
Speaker 0: you're talking 40 ish.

522
00:37:55,274 --> 00:37:57,624
Speaker 0: that I guess the line we have to make is 40,000 years ago, maybe up to 80,000 of depending.

523
00:37:57,644 --> 00:38:06,233
Speaker 0: is the difference between Just putting on some fur and making some fire?

524
00:38:06,574 --> 00:38:10,508
Speaker 0: is that you're changing the environment Instead of putting something or doing so?

525
00:38:10,548 --> 00:38:14,380
Speaker 1: we're only talking about changing the environment here in this exactly, right?

526
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:23,390
Speaker 1: So like going into a cave to cool down could be considered the original air conditioning But you didn't make that now cold, but right.

527
00:38:23,872 --> 00:38:36,482
Speaker 0: there are very early civilizations that did things like Have a cave or a building that was constructed in such a way to have constant air flow in through low places and out through High places.

528
00:38:36,863 --> 00:38:44,324
Speaker 0: that would do the V part of HVAC and often would also do half of what air conditioning does Mm-hmm.

529
00:38:44,645 --> 00:38:47,739
Speaker 1: Well, I mean you could also, you know, just building a roof could be.

530
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:49,988
Speaker 1: you know That's opaque could be considered cooling.

531
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:52,660
Speaker 0: I consider insulation to be a part of HVAC.

532
00:38:53,675 --> 00:38:57,949
Speaker 0: Yeah But uh, yeah, I'm talking about modern times.

533
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:02,646
Speaker 0: to start instead of getting into a history lesson because I Don't know what comes next.

534
00:39:03,169 --> 00:39:08,315
Speaker 1: as far as I'm concerned it went from, you know Sit around a fire like even I think in my medieval times.

535
00:39:08,335 --> 00:39:08,958
Speaker 1: Like what's the heating?

536
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:11,550
Speaker 0: Oh Oh, you want to go down a rabbit hole.

537
00:39:11,791 --> 00:39:13,600
Speaker 0: the technology of sitting around a fire?

538
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,030
Speaker 0: Advanced way more times than you realize.

539
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:20,160
Speaker 0: So here's one example is still sitting around a fire.

540
00:39:21,643 --> 00:39:35,016
Speaker 0: No, so the big problem with fire like a fireplace especially an old fireplace or what people in the industry would call a naive Fireplace is that they don't actually radiate that much heat into your environment.

541
00:39:35,558 --> 00:39:36,340
Speaker 0: Most of it escapes.

542
00:39:37,345 --> 00:39:47,580
Speaker 0: The way you met the advancements in fire came around Getting the heat to linger and stay in the environment while getting the noxious results of combustion to leave the environment.

543
00:39:47,941 --> 00:39:50,710
Speaker 0: That's where things like hearth stones came from.

544
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,796
Speaker 0: do you know what a hearth stone is?

545
00:39:52,816 --> 00:39:53,920
Speaker 1: it's a card game.

546
00:39:54,748 --> 00:39:55,477
Speaker 1: everyone knows that.

547
00:39:56,609 --> 00:39:58,576
Speaker 0: so God damn it.

548
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:03,280
Speaker 0: The worst thing is I just typed it into Google to pull up the Wikipedia to make sure I don't say anything wrong.

549
00:40:03,621 --> 00:40:08,536
Speaker 0: And of course, it's all the card game all the way down to multiple.

550
00:40:08,696 --> 00:40:09,739
Speaker 0: God is still the card game.

551
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:13,210
Speaker 0: Hearthstone real fire.

552
00:40:15,086 --> 00:40:15,636
Speaker 0: God damn it.

553
00:40:18,028 --> 00:40:18,339
Speaker 0: still.

554
00:40:20,632 --> 00:40:23,787
Speaker 0: You know The modern internet is good in some ways.

555
00:40:23,928 --> 00:40:27,096
Speaker 0: it anyway hearth stones or things like them.

556
00:40:27,538 --> 00:40:28,340
Speaker 0: what they would do.

557
00:40:29,066 --> 00:40:33,229
Speaker 0: Sit in your fireplace Collect the heat like some of them.

558
00:40:33,269 --> 00:40:40,536
Speaker 0: you put a big fucking piece of iron just in your fireplace And it gets hot and it turns red and it radiates the heat into the room.

559
00:40:40,978 --> 00:40:44,231
Speaker 0: at campsites You could put big rocks in the fire.

560
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:44,814
Speaker 0: They get hot.

561
00:40:44,854 --> 00:40:45,316
Speaker 0: you put them in.

562
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,220
Speaker 0: water heats the water.

563
00:40:46,501 --> 00:40:48,615
Speaker 0: You put the water in your sleeping bag at night.

564
00:40:48,656 --> 00:40:49,219
Speaker 0: it warms you.

565
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:57,779
Speaker 0: Technology around how to use fire to warm up a home or a dwelling has advanced in many more steps than you might realize.

566
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:01,180
Speaker 0: out there We're not I mean in this so we're not gonna cover that in detail.

567
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,050
Speaker 1: I mean the house I grew up in right.

568
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:11,200
Speaker 1: it came with this little you know It wasn't the kind of fireplace that you have in the you know, like and set in the wall the classic kind, right?

569
00:41:11,462 --> 00:41:12,079
Speaker 1: It was like this met.

570
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:18,098
Speaker 1: It was the metal box kind that sort of set away from the wall So air can get all around it.

571
00:41:18,448 --> 00:41:20,207
Speaker 1: Yeah And it's made of metal.

572
00:41:20,488 --> 00:41:23,883
Speaker 1: and the house actually Kate does a shed out back that I that Collapsed.

573
00:41:23,964 --> 00:41:24,608
Speaker 1: it had cold.

574
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,540
Speaker 1: you were I guess it was supposed to burn coal in there.

575
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,690
Speaker 1: We only ever burned wood in there.

576
00:41:27,711 --> 00:41:28,659
Speaker 1: We never bought coal in there.

577
00:41:28,901 --> 00:41:32,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, not that I remember even though there were just sacks of coal out back.

578
00:41:32,961 --> 00:41:41,765
Speaker 0: I considered buying a house that was heated by a coal fired boiler back in 2009.

579
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:42,328
Speaker 1: oh I didn't.

580
00:41:42,570 --> 00:42:00,130
Speaker 1: but yeah, but in the winter Occasionally right to offset just the cost of heating with the gas heat that the house came with We would put wood in there set it on fire and it would make the living room that it was in Really really nice and toasty and in a pleasant way.

581
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:10,360
Speaker 1: and there was this fan up near the top of the room That would then sort of blow air out of that one room into the rest of the house like this one little fan.

582
00:42:10,943 --> 00:42:16,700
Speaker 1: So that way you could heat up sort of the whole house with you know Cuz it would blow right into like the staircase like in the perfect spot.

583
00:42:16,861 --> 00:42:20,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the rest of the house got kind of war not way warm.

584
00:42:21,042 --> 00:42:30,480
Speaker 1: It wasn't that great at evening out But kind of you know warmer as if you just lit this fire and as one Thing and then there was a big old chimney on the outside of the house.

585
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:34,200
Speaker 0: It did, you know exhausted through yep, my grandparents house that they built themselves.

586
00:42:34,705 --> 00:42:47,822
Speaker 0: They designed it where it had two Fireplaces to provide like the ambient heat and save money and make it comfortable in the winter and then they had a regular old like electric furnace to fill in the gaps when it wasn't that cold when they want to make a fire.

587
00:42:47,903 --> 00:42:58,043
Speaker 0: and the two fireplaces were actually very different designs and As a kid, I was fascinated with one in the living room because by the time I was a kid They were old.

588
00:42:58,364 --> 00:42:59,308
Speaker 0: that house was huge.

589
00:42:59,709 --> 00:43:03,727
Speaker 0: The living room was basically this unused Museum of Furniture.

590
00:43:03,767 --> 00:43:04,476
Speaker 0: no one sat in.

591
00:43:05,644 --> 00:43:09,240
Speaker 0: The Intellivision and the Atari were in there with a TV that no one used.

592
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:19,360
Speaker 0: It was connected to a dining room that also never got used except on like holidays where the family came over and as kids That fireplace just because it was the one they didn't use.

593
00:43:19,921 --> 00:43:29,417
Speaker 0: We were obsessed with lighting fires in it and multiple times our grandparents our parents had to stop us as we had on our own Tried to start a fire in that thing.

594
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:33,550
Speaker 0: Yeah But they use the one in the family room all the time.

595
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:48,100
Speaker 0: and I gotta say just as a personal thing There's something about sitting in front of a fireplace on a cold day that no modern technology will replicate though I recognize that as a combination of nostalgia and novelty.

596
00:43:49,303 --> 00:43:55,099
Speaker 1: Well, I mean it's like, you know It's like you could go into an air-conditioned, you know room.

597
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:59,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, right in when it's really hot out and suddenly you're all cooled out all over.

598
00:43:59,942 --> 00:44:07,800
Speaker 1: But even if you're in the air-conditioned room Right the I got ice water that you're holding and drinking like is way cold.

599
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:18,960
Speaker 0: Well, it's the difference between a radiant heat versus ambient heat same reason why there are some heaters that will heat the room But like kerosene heaters those kinds of things a lot of like directed space heaters.

600
00:44:19,421 --> 00:44:24,799
Speaker 0: They only heat you if they're pointed at you like the heat is coming from it and it doesn't go anywhere else.

601
00:44:25,764 --> 00:44:26,710
Speaker 0: Like it doesn't heat the room.

602
00:44:26,771 --> 00:44:28,260
Speaker 0: It just heats you right?

603
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:43,776
Speaker 1: So a fireplace is like, you know, it's like it's not a. it can heat the whole room But it's a lot more like the ice water where it's like it's real hot It's a fire right and you can get really close to it and it's like ah Next to your radiator you kind of can yep.

604
00:44:44,158 --> 00:44:48,948
Speaker 0: Well like Like, you know I ski Obviously COVID kind of put a damper on that.

605
00:44:49,009 --> 00:45:00,910
Speaker 0: but one of the most sublime feelings in the world is Skiing for half a day and then you're cold and you're tired and you're hungry and you go into that lodge on the top of Mountain and there's a fireplace that's bigger than you can imagine.

606
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:12,199
Speaker 0: that was built in like the early 60s and There's a gigantic fire and you sit next to it You take your boots off you put your feet up on that stone and you just hang out there for an hour.

607
00:45:13,281 --> 00:45:16,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, as long as you don't have to breathe in any smoke fire is pretty nice.

608
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:24,132
Speaker 0: Fireplaces require maintenance and effort and there's a reason why Almost every fireplace the modern home is fake or there.

609
00:45:24,152 --> 00:45:27,986
Speaker 0: at least they're not like a real Fireplace from olden times.

610
00:45:28,287 --> 00:45:31,740
Speaker 0: They usually are just gas-powered the logs are usually fake.

611
00:45:32,141 --> 00:45:38,640
Speaker 0: They're usually separated like much more cleanly from the environment and the fire department's much happier for it.

612
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:44,646
Speaker 0: Yep, cuz a lot of people who buy a house that's old, you know, my dad was a fireman My grandpa was a fireman.

613
00:45:44,907 --> 00:45:46,133
Speaker 0: My great-grandpa was a fireman.

614
00:45:46,194 --> 00:45:47,359
Speaker 0: I know a lot about fire safety.

615
00:45:48,223 --> 00:45:52,720
Speaker 0: Fire places are not dangerous if they are properly when used properly.

616
00:45:54,022 --> 00:45:58,367
Speaker 0: Most people who buy houses that have a real fireplace Don't know things like.

617
00:45:58,789 --> 00:45:59,994
Speaker 0: you got to hire a chimney sweep.

618
00:46:00,095 --> 00:46:01,079
Speaker 0: That's still a thing.

619
00:46:01,683 --> 00:46:04,399
Speaker 0: Chimney sweeps are still a thing and without them you will die.

620
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:08,700
Speaker 0: Chris like things will build up in your fireplace that will kill your whole family.

621
00:46:09,463 --> 00:46:19,730
Speaker 1: even if you have a fireplace and you haven't used it in like forever and you like You know you get you if you decide oh I want to use it now You got to get the chimney sweep first Even if you think it's empty up there.

622
00:46:19,831 --> 00:46:22,684
Speaker 0: or you have to know About fireplaces.

623
00:46:22,704 --> 00:46:23,949
Speaker 0: you have to know how to check a flue.

624
00:46:24,331 --> 00:46:26,180
Speaker 0: You have to know what all those dampers do.

625
00:46:26,561 --> 00:46:27,685
Speaker 0: What is a damper?

626
00:46:28,146 --> 00:46:29,230
Speaker 0: when do you turn it?

627
00:46:29,551 --> 00:46:30,374
Speaker 0: Why do you turn it?

628
00:46:30,715 --> 00:46:32,320
Speaker 0: And also how do you structure the fire?

629
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,940
Speaker 0: Nobody knows how to make a goddamn fire in a fireplace anymore.

630
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:43,280
Speaker 0: You have to line the wood up the right way or it doesn't work that well or it's dangerous Yep, so when you are too much wood not enough wood.

631
00:46:43,601 --> 00:46:54,826
Speaker 0: Oh, I was at a place was like a decade ago, but I was at a house and they had a fireplace That clearly it looked like it hadn't been used much But it had been used a few times.

632
00:46:55,148 --> 00:47:02,277
Speaker 0: and next to it was all the shit you need for a fireplace Like the pincers and the poker and the rake and all that stuff.

633
00:47:02,799 --> 00:47:04,698
Speaker 1: Yep Bellows are the most fun.

634
00:47:05,242 --> 00:47:09,340
Speaker 0: I decided to start a fire in this fireplace because there's a place we were renting and guess what?

635
00:47:10,443 --> 00:47:14,244
Speaker 0: all the stuff next to the fireplace was Decorative shit.

636
00:47:14,365 --> 00:47:19,639
Speaker 0: It wasn't usable, but they had clearly been using it like it was real because they did not know the difference.

637
00:47:22,262 --> 00:47:25,130
Speaker 0: But yeah, don't touch a fireplace if you don't know how to use a fireplace.

638
00:47:25,512 --> 00:47:45,791
Speaker 0: but in my life, let's see I In terms of heat every house every place I've ever lived until I moved to New York State had an electric furnace and Forced air heating with vents a cold air return and a hot air send Filling the entire house and just a furnace.

639
00:47:45,892 --> 00:47:48,040
Speaker 1: ever lived anywhere with electric heating?

640
00:47:48,221 --> 00:47:50,971
Speaker 1: I know I've actually had electric heating ever.

641
00:47:51,313 --> 00:47:53,120
Speaker 0: electric heating is increasing like in New York.

642
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:54,226
Speaker 0: They're like we're not.

643
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:56,620
Speaker 0: buildings aren't gonna have gas heat when they build new ones.

644
00:47:57,001 --> 00:48:01,680
Speaker 1: Well, that's good for the environment, but I don't know if I've lived with electric heating.

645
00:48:01,901 --> 00:48:04,740
Speaker 1: I've heard that it's simply expensive which makes sense, right?

646
00:48:05,302 --> 00:48:09,660
Speaker 0: Never saw a radiator that was actually used until I moved to New York.

647
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,153
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean that's not a thing.

648
00:48:12,213 --> 00:48:17,219
Speaker 0: in most of the Midwest You have a central furnace with forced air heating and vents and filters and shit.

649
00:48:18,182 --> 00:48:26,107
Speaker 1: Yeah, the places that I lived had either, you know had had boilers of some kind in the basement That were you know, heating up water.

650
00:48:26,328 --> 00:48:39,116
Speaker 0: In fact, I'll legit I'll admit until I came to RIT Like literally until we moved into colony I Kind of thought that the radiator with the spitting and all that stuff was an old-timey thing.

651
00:48:39,136 --> 00:48:40,540
Speaker 0: That literally did not exist anymore.

652
00:48:41,887 --> 00:48:44,645
Speaker 1: Well, that's you know The place that was around.

653
00:48:44,665 --> 00:48:50,213
Speaker 0: but I moved to RIT and that that radiant like shitty heating along our baseboards was there And that was the thing.

654
00:48:50,941 --> 00:48:56,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah at a baseboards or actual radiators right that were hooked up to some boiler in the basement.

655
00:48:57,001 --> 00:48:58,378
Speaker 1: That was boiling water, right?

656
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:13,420
Speaker 1: We're heating it up a whole lot and piping it around the house and then you know The piping goes through some sort of radiator of some shape right and then it warms up the air near it You know with lots of surface area and then the hot air circulates around.

657
00:49:13,921 --> 00:49:17,092
Speaker 0: Older houses were like that for a lot of reasons.

658
00:49:17,152 --> 00:49:20,650
Speaker 0: that made a lot of sense and can still make a lot of sense because there are.

659
00:49:20,872 --> 00:49:33,632
Speaker 0: there are big pros and cons of Circulating a liquid and having radiators versus centralized forced air versus Hybrid like window units like we have in most modern New York City apartments.

660
00:49:34,153 --> 00:49:36,420
Speaker 0: like no one system is better or worse.

661
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,840
Speaker 0: They all have big big pros and cons like what you described.

662
00:49:39,686 --> 00:49:40,654
Speaker 0: Well, there's a lot of benefits.

663
00:49:40,674 --> 00:49:45,088
Speaker 0: that kind of system That's not that doesn't cover the V part of HVAC.

664
00:49:45,409 --> 00:49:49,299
Speaker 0: It'll heat up your house, but it doesn't exchange the air in your house.

665
00:49:50,142 --> 00:49:50,964
Speaker 1: Nope, not at all.

666
00:49:51,826 --> 00:50:12,960
Speaker 0: and a problem that a lot of people run into is old houses that get retrofitted or like have additions added To them tend to have poor air circulation because they rely on that kind of heating and cooling But they don't have like like a cheap house in the Midwest in the 50s and 60s would have a system that heated But that same system circulated the air in the entire house constantly

667
00:50:14,321 --> 00:50:15,145
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, but

668
00:50:15,226 --> 00:50:16,632
Speaker 0: the cons of that kind of system?

669
00:50:17,295 --> 00:50:23,883
Speaker 0: you're cooking in the kitchen Guess what gets pulled into the cold air return in like the whole house smells like what you're cooking or Dustin.

670
00:50:23,984 --> 00:50:24,848
Speaker 0: beauly positive.

671
00:50:25,249 --> 00:50:26,113
Speaker 0: It could be a positive.

672
00:50:26,214 --> 00:50:27,318
Speaker 0: It was often a negative.

673
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:37,931
Speaker 0: Garbage and Lynn like dust and dirt builds up in those vents and If you're imagining how they clean those kinds of events what you're imagining is wrong.

674
00:50:38,011 --> 00:50:39,756
Speaker 0: It's so much worse than what you're imagining.

675
00:50:40,158 --> 00:50:43,796
Speaker 0: It sucks shit Especially in a house built in the 70s.

676
00:50:45,921 --> 00:50:52,218
Speaker 0: You put a vibrator in there like an industrial one and you shake it all out and you ruin your house And there's dust in the air for months.

677
00:50:53,822 --> 00:50:55,479
Speaker 1: Why even clean it this uh?

678
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:57,424
Speaker 1: Why is the worst?

679
00:50:57,766 --> 00:51:01,259
Speaker 0: why indeed we probably should not have bothered cleaning it?

680
00:51:01,299 --> 00:51:10,151
Speaker 0: my mom Thought it was a good idea to clean it because of allergies and stuff But honestly leaving that shit in there would have been better for our collective allergies than trying Robot that can clean it.

681
00:51:10,191 --> 00:51:17,860
Speaker 0: now, maybe Some systems will have centralized filtration, which is a cool thing or centralized humidification or dehumidification.

682
00:51:19,104 --> 00:51:25,214
Speaker 0: but yeah that Nowadays in New York we deal with this fact that most New York apartments.

683
00:51:25,695 --> 00:51:28,417
Speaker 0: You can't even control your own heat It's just on or not on.

684
00:51:28,437 --> 00:51:34,919
Speaker 1: yeah Well, I didn't control my own heat at the previous apartment which had radiators right and it had in wall air conditioner.

685
00:51:36,281 --> 00:51:51,299
Speaker 1: But at the new apartment we basically have hotel style P tax which are All the rage for new you know big building Construction because it's way cheaper for the person who makes the building and owns the building to do it that way.

686
00:51:51,459 --> 00:51:54,983
Speaker 0: yep And they can meter you directly Right.

687
00:51:55,044 --> 00:51:57,920
Speaker 1: so basically this is one unit in each room.

688
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,340
Speaker 1: They're all the same unit in the whole building and you can get it does heating and air conditioning.

689
00:52:03,303 --> 00:52:13,546
Speaker 1: It's in the wall right and it uses gas if you want to heat and he's electricity if you want an air condition and It blows right in the room.

690
00:52:13,566 --> 00:52:17,240
Speaker 1: you control all the different rooms separately or ball together.

691
00:52:17,281 --> 00:52:17,833
Speaker 1: It's up to you.

692
00:52:18,341 --> 00:52:20,229
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then which you gotta pay for all that?

693
00:52:20,269 --> 00:52:22,700
Speaker 1: electricity or gas because they got in the basement.

694
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:24,440
Speaker 1: There's a meter for every apartment.

695
00:52:24,621 --> 00:52:27,433
Speaker 0: It's so our building does not have a meter for gas.

696
00:52:27,453 --> 00:52:29,140
Speaker 0: gas is just free in our building and so is water.

697
00:52:29,524 --> 00:52:32,145
Speaker 0: Oh, we only pay for our electricity Mmm.

698
00:52:32,287 --> 00:52:33,219
Speaker 1: Well we're paying for the gas.

699
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,655
Speaker 1: There's like a zillion meters in the basement one for every.

700
00:52:35,756 --> 00:52:36,420
Speaker 1: I went in that room.

701
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:43,990
Speaker 0: It's scary week because we just have one giant central industrialized boiler that literally heats the entire Building and it takes them.

702
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:45,540
Speaker 0: I was talking to the guys downstairs.

703
00:52:45,821 --> 00:52:51,861
Speaker 0: It actually takes them like a full day to bring it online every year when it's time to turn it on Mmm.

704
00:52:52,283 --> 00:52:52,845
Speaker 1: It makes sense.

705
00:52:53,006 --> 00:52:53,227
Speaker 0: Yeah.

706
00:52:53,468 --> 00:52:56,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I've learned more recently like in the past few years.

707
00:52:56,844 --> 00:53:00,496
Speaker 1: It makes perfect sense when you think about it But I just hadn't thought about it my whole life.

708
00:53:00,556 --> 00:53:01,000
Speaker 1: my whole life.

709
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:06,497
Speaker 1: My thoughts were like, you know, yeah, obviously, you know, we'd rather not use fossil fuels.

710
00:53:06,577 --> 00:53:07,420
Speaker 1: That's bad, right?

711
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:13,360
Speaker 1: But you know, I didn't think about like direct harm of having a fossil fuel heated home.

712
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:23,011
Speaker 1: I was just like, oh, yeah gas stove is way better than electric stove Even though worse for the yeah, there was just that study showing how bad indoor air pollution is Especially in apartments that have gas cooking.

713
00:53:23,794 --> 00:53:23,995
Speaker 1: Yeah.

714
00:53:24,035 --> 00:53:25,100
Speaker 1: Well, that's like us, right?

715
00:53:26,182 --> 00:53:31,368
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, if you have a gas stove and you you know Even with proper exhaust.

716
00:53:31,429 --> 00:53:33,420
Speaker 1: a lot of places just don't have the proper exhaust.

717
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,942
Speaker 1: They don't have a hood that's actually blowing out, you know to the outside We don't.

718
00:53:37,223 --> 00:53:38,628
Speaker 0: but it's actually not a problem.

719
00:53:38,688 --> 00:53:41,800
Speaker 0: not that much of a problem because the way our buildings designs those P tech units.

720
00:53:42,162 --> 00:53:55,419
Speaker 0: there's one in each of the three main zones of our apartment and They are also Ventilation systems that are designed to pull fresh air in to each room to replace the air some number of times per day.

721
00:53:55,439 --> 00:54:00,860
Speaker 0: and The apartments are all positive pressure and the interior hallways are all negative pressure.

722
00:54:01,201 --> 00:54:06,279
Speaker 0: So there's a constant flow of fresh air into the apartments into the hallways and then out of the building.

723
00:54:07,002 --> 00:54:11,636
Speaker 1: Yeah, but basically, you know, there was this idea that's you know, you burn, you know wood.

724
00:54:11,716 --> 00:54:12,980
Speaker 1: obviously all this smoke everywhere.

725
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:15,228
Speaker 1: You don't want to sit downwind of a campfire, right?

726
00:54:15,509 --> 00:54:18,560
Speaker 1: No, you know you burn coal, obviously you can't even fuck it.

727
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:19,783
Speaker 1: Oh, that's a big problem.

728
00:54:19,803 --> 00:54:23,855
Speaker 0: the Midwest all these people decided to save money on electricity.

729
00:54:24,156 --> 00:54:34,560
Speaker 0: in places that have either Electric powered furnaces but are cold or places that don't have like municipal gas We have to buy propane or something or we're even worse fuel oil, which is a nightmare.

730
00:54:35,042 --> 00:54:38,959
Speaker 0: I had a co-worker who had his basement flooded with that stuff an entire tankers worth once.

731
00:54:40,122 --> 00:54:41,529
Speaker 0: Yeah, the house was a write-off.

732
00:54:41,549 --> 00:54:43,920
Speaker 0: they had to leave they just had to move out of their home permanently.

733
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:45,518
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was a hazmat site.

734
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:52,818
Speaker 1: Yep Point is is that natural gas which is what's being piped to most houses for your stove and stuff.

735
00:54:52,838 --> 00:54:57,010
Speaker 1: when you burn it You don't smell there's no smoke, you know smell burning.

736
00:54:57,050 --> 00:55:00,820
Speaker 1: It feels like, you know, oh, I guess it's all being burned up, right?

737
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:01,886
Speaker 1: It's like it's totally this.

738
00:55:01,926 --> 00:55:03,132
Speaker 1: not, you know poisoning me.

739
00:55:03,152 --> 00:55:04,540
Speaker 1: It's like no it's horribly poisoning you.

740
00:55:05,124 --> 00:55:12,280
Speaker 1: You know kids who live in houses with you know Gas being burned or like way more likely to have asthma and shit by a large factor, right?

741
00:55:12,381 --> 00:55:14,439
Speaker 1: It's it's really not good for you.

742
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:15,746
Speaker 1: You're you're got.

743
00:55:15,826 --> 00:55:18,459
Speaker 1: you're burning fossil fuels in your home and then breathing them.

744
00:55:19,142 --> 00:55:20,369
Speaker 1: So on that way bad.

745
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:36,859
Speaker 0: in the suburbs in America the everything I just described before a lot of people got it into their heads to get wood stoves or Wood furnaces to supplement their heating so they could use like our renewable resource and Run it when it's really cold.

746
00:55:37,202 --> 00:55:42,360
Speaker 0: So they don't have to use as much of their like their rest of their heating system Like the electric system is very expensive.

747
00:55:43,108 --> 00:55:50,300
Speaker 0: the problem is Most of these wood stoves or wood furnaces or wood like all that that kind of technology.

748
00:55:51,640 --> 00:56:04,830
Speaker 0: They're super polluting to the local air quality in their neighborhoods because they're often Poorly regulated and while there are extremely efficient Very low pollution wood pellet like furnaces.

749
00:56:05,452 --> 00:56:06,876
Speaker 0: That is not what most people deploy.

750
00:56:06,916 --> 00:56:08,180
Speaker 0: that is not what most people use.

751
00:56:09,061 --> 00:56:10,485
Speaker 1: Nope, they got some cheapo one.

752
00:56:10,946 --> 00:56:13,032
Speaker 1: Yep, probably set up incorrectly.

753
00:56:13,553 --> 00:56:15,278
Speaker 0: So let's talk about a chimney.

754
00:56:15,318 --> 00:56:15,900
Speaker 1: That's not clean.

755
00:56:16,121 --> 00:56:21,691
Speaker 1: Yeah, before I conditioning so I mean when I was you know Our house was not the newest house that we I grew up in.

756
00:56:21,891 --> 00:56:22,514
Speaker 1: Oh my house.

757
00:56:22,534 --> 00:56:23,759
Speaker 0: I grew up in was built in like the 20s.

758
00:56:25,082 --> 00:56:28,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's like people and people I knew their houses weren't that new either.

759
00:56:29,222 --> 00:56:30,406
Speaker 1: So I didn't really like.

760
00:56:30,446 --> 00:56:33,658
Speaker 1: I knew like central air was on the new houses like in the 90s.

761
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,954
Speaker 1: But it wasn't until like the mid late 90s.

762
00:56:37,015 --> 00:56:43,400
Speaker 0: I started seeing we Moved a lot like every four or five years we moved just we just moved to a different house.

763
00:56:43,801 --> 00:56:56,044
Speaker 0: so by the time in middle school, we moved into a house that has central air and I Never lived in a house that didn't have central air until again RIT colony Dorms, etc.

764
00:56:56,164 --> 00:56:57,912
Speaker 1: I don't think I've ever lived like.

765
00:56:57,952 --> 00:56:59,720
Speaker 1: I've been to plenty houses with central air.

766
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:13,173
Speaker 1: I don't think I've lived as my main house in a ever with central air, but even more in my entire life I never lived anywhere that didn't have air conditioning until the dorms at RIT Even in those houses before the central air.

767
00:57:13,937 --> 00:57:18,233
Speaker 0: the one house We lived in in Detroit had a giant hole in the wall wall.

768
00:57:18,454 --> 00:57:20,360
Speaker 0: Like it wasn't a window air conditioning unit.

769
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,525
Speaker 0: There's just this giant fucking hole in the wall.

770
00:57:22,866 --> 00:57:32,007
Speaker 0: that had a gigantic air conditioner like installed in it as part of the house and That air conditioning the entire downstairs.

771
00:57:32,388 --> 00:57:38,845
Speaker 0: and then there was a window unit in our bedroom and our parents had another one of these like Giant wall units in their bedroom.

772
00:57:39,728 --> 00:57:44,240
Speaker 1: We did not have the house did not have any air conditioning built into it whatsoever.

773
00:57:44,423 --> 00:57:50,479
Speaker 1: So we bought window units But we only had one to start with and eventually we got like, you know a couple more.

774
00:57:50,741 --> 00:57:53,251
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, but that was you know, that's all we had.

775
00:57:53,271 --> 00:57:57,183
Speaker 1: It was just a few window units In college.

776
00:57:57,264 --> 00:57:58,608
Speaker 1: We were mostly there in the winter.

777
00:57:58,648 --> 00:57:59,310
Speaker 1: It's Rochester.

778
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:02,200
Speaker 1: We didn't need that much though that summer we lived there.

779
00:58:02,783 --> 00:58:11,416
Speaker 0: I remember it was hot enough to work Scott We talked at length about how we could jury-rig some sort of cooling in that apartment.

780
00:58:12,318 --> 00:58:15,360
Speaker 0: I don't remember You don't remember the dry ice conversation?

781
00:58:17,406 --> 00:58:18,060
Speaker 1: No, not at all.

782
00:58:18,221 --> 00:58:23,385
Speaker 0: we we talked a lot about I was too fucking hot and we would do anything to have air conditioning, but we didn't have any money.

783
00:58:23,405 --> 00:58:27,013
Speaker 0: and The way our IT worked was we could have gotten.

784
00:58:27,415 --> 00:58:28,560
Speaker 1: we could have bought weird windows.

785
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:29,886
Speaker 1: We couldn't put the normal ones in.

786
00:58:30,127 --> 00:58:32,617
Speaker 0: we could have bought one and put it in the room.

787
00:58:32,637 --> 00:58:33,360
Speaker 1: We have weird windows.

788
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,002
Speaker 1: They didn't go in.

789
00:58:34,384 --> 00:58:35,890
Speaker 0: No, they would have gone in just fine.

790
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:36,853
Speaker 0: You get the one like what Alex had.

791
00:58:36,873 --> 00:58:39,911
Speaker 1: I Thought oh the with that weird.

792
00:58:39,972 --> 00:58:40,860
Speaker 1: No, I wasn't buying one of those.

793
00:58:41,141 --> 00:58:49,840
Speaker 0: The problem was even if we bought one the way our IT worked is we would have had to register that we had an air Conditioner and our rent would have gone up by like a hundred bucks a month, which we couldn't afford.

794
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:50,723
Speaker 0: At least I couldn't afford.

795
00:58:51,104 --> 00:59:03,493
Speaker 1: so anyway, the point is is that you know, I've been mostly living with window units You know and then or a place where there was a effectively a window unit This happened to be in a hole in the wall.

796
00:59:03,513 --> 00:59:04,339
Speaker 1: That wasn't the window.

797
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:07,129
Speaker 0: Well, like now our P tech units are just also air conditioners.

798
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:10,220
Speaker 1: So yeah, it's just which is effectively a window unit.

799
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:12,914
Speaker 1: It just has its own special hole in the wall for itself.

800
00:59:13,035 --> 00:59:13,920
Speaker 1: That's not the window.

801
00:59:14,181 --> 00:59:19,074
Speaker 0: Yep, I think the key the thing to think realize about air conditioning is that

802
00:59:20,157 --> 00:59:20,478
Speaker 1: it is

803
00:59:20,718 --> 00:59:34,200
Speaker 0: weird that Americans in particular have historically treated heating as a necessity and Air-conditioning is just a luxury because that flattens the fact that there are a lot of places even in America where?

804
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:37,658
Speaker 0: Cooling an environment is just as important to human health as heating it.

805
00:59:38,631 --> 00:59:39,039
Speaker 1: That's true.

806
00:59:40,162 --> 00:59:45,563
Speaker 1: And but also I think it's just you know, this climate change right is a lot of America wasn't Hot.

807
00:59:45,805 --> 00:59:47,294
Speaker 1: Yeah, right at least, you know.

808
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:49,999
Speaker 0: for that much I mean like I grew up in a place that was weird.

809
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:55,860
Speaker 0: Michigan is very hot in the summer and very humid in the summer, but also very cold in the winter.

810
00:59:57,161 --> 01:00:00,673
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's like it would only the amount of time of the year.

811
01:00:00,813 --> 01:00:05,740
Speaker 1: if you even if you had the air conditioner that you Would use it would only be like a couple months.

812
01:00:06,702 --> 01:00:08,652
Speaker 0: Those months with like an attic fan out of 12.

813
01:00:08,652 --> 01:00:12,314
Speaker 1: out of 12 months You're gonna use the air conditioner for two or three.

814
01:00:12,334 --> 01:00:14,466
Speaker 1: Yeah, right It's like it didn't.

815
01:00:14,808 --> 01:00:16,999
Speaker 1: or even if you had central air, it's like you're gonna use it.

816
01:00:17,522 --> 01:00:25,060
Speaker 1: You know not that you know, but now you're gonna be using it a lot more All right, whereas opposed you go to a country like say, you know, like Singapore.

817
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:27,307
Speaker 0: Yeah, like yeah Singapore like air conditioning.

818
01:00:27,327 --> 01:00:37,004
Speaker 0: It could be hot enough and humid enough in Singapore during the hot season that Humans can't survive Outside for that long Like everyone knows.

819
01:00:37,065 --> 01:00:37,446
Speaker 1: many.

820
01:00:37,526 --> 01:00:42,480
Speaker 1: the mini units right those little ones the box that sits outside and just has pipes coming in right?

821
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:43,902
Speaker 1: Whatever those are cars.

822
01:00:43,983 --> 01:00:51,709
Speaker 1: I took some great photos of those when I last time they're called mini something right those ones mini splits Mini split that's the one that's like that.

823
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:53,817
Speaker 1: Those are actually the best ones possible.

824
01:00:53,857 --> 01:00:55,483
Speaker 1: the mini splits That's like.

825
01:00:55,663 --> 01:00:58,211
Speaker 1: that's the ideal unless you have a big old house.

826
01:00:58,291 --> 01:01:01,540
Speaker 0: Well, obviously there are alternative means of air conditioning.

827
01:01:01,721 --> 01:01:11,492
Speaker 0: So for example in the projects and in a lot of older buildings that have old-school radiators in the summer You could run cold water through the radiators and air condition.

828
01:01:11,733 --> 01:01:12,797
Speaker 0: You can cool and you can.

829
01:01:12,977 --> 01:01:13,740
Speaker 1: you can do that.

830
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:15,094
Speaker 0: it's really effective.

831
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:26,529
Speaker 0: but The thing about air conditioning is that modern air conditioning and a lot of people forget this does two things it cools and It dehumidifies by the nature of how it works.

832
01:01:27,191 --> 01:01:29,500
Speaker 0: that other option only cools.

833
01:01:30,287 --> 01:01:31,680
Speaker 0: It does not dehumidify.

834
01:01:32,101 --> 01:01:32,523
Speaker 0: There were.

835
01:01:32,603 --> 01:01:36,174
Speaker 1: well, you'll get a lot of condensation on the radiator and hope it doesn't rust.

836
01:01:36,455 --> 01:01:39,702
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that is not enough Dehumidification.

837
01:01:39,943 --> 01:01:40,645
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

838
01:01:41,106 --> 01:02:03,088
Speaker 0: and the fact that air conditioning dehumidifies is a big goddamn deal That a lot of people don't realize because they don't remember a world when Alternatives were used or they've never lived in a place where those alternatives are used like swamp cooling and all that other stuff Really effective at cooling depending on the local environment Not dehumidifying which is kind of a big deal.

839
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:11,100
Speaker 0: like Abe Lincoln when he was dying They used an early form of air conditioning to try to cool the room, but it didn't dehumidify.

840
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:14,943
Speaker 0: It was basically giant blocks of ice and fans That work.

841
01:02:14,963 --> 01:02:15,486
Speaker 1: that's really good.

842
01:02:15,708 --> 01:02:15,949
Speaker 0: It works.

843
01:02:16,009 --> 01:02:18,020
Speaker 0: Okay, but it also can make the room in human.

844
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:21,740
Speaker 1: You can you can drive, you know, we have refrigerated trucks these days, right?

845
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:29,870
Speaker 1: If you just put a block of dry ice in a in a back of a truck with a fan on it and close the door You can store meat in there for a long ass time.

846
01:02:29,911 --> 01:02:32,460
Speaker 0: It'll also kill anyone who tries to hang out in that room.

847
01:02:32,982 --> 01:02:36,616
Speaker 1: Well, you don't hang out in there, but you can go in get the meat and get out.

848
01:02:36,636 --> 01:02:39,955
Speaker 0: Yeah, depending I mean nowadays they just use active cooling.

849
01:02:40,015 --> 01:02:45,639
Speaker 0: There's a you see those Cooler cars, but air conditioning.

850
01:02:45,659 --> 01:02:49,171
Speaker 0: I Really really missed it.

851
01:02:49,352 --> 01:03:00,469
Speaker 0: when I was at RIT Like that was the first time in my life I'd ever experienced like a day when it was like 90-something degrees and I couldn't just go inside somewhere.

852
01:03:00,489 --> 01:03:00,892
Speaker 0: That was cool.

853
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:19,350
Speaker 1: I Basically like, you know, even no matter what heating and cooling system I have no matter how good it is or crappy It is I just generally For at least the past several years and try to you within what within the amount that I can control I try to minimize using it as much as possible.

854
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:22,260
Speaker 1: All right, it's just like I haven't turned the heat on yet.

855
01:03:22,481 --> 01:03:23,666
Speaker 1: I probably might turn it on today.

856
01:03:23,687 --> 01:03:26,520
Speaker 0: I I don't bother practicing that form of self-denial.

857
01:03:26,641 --> 01:03:30,320
Speaker 0: I keep my environment comfortable within the bounds of what is reasonable.

858
01:03:31,322 --> 01:03:31,905
Speaker 1: I'm comfortable.

859
01:03:32,107 --> 01:03:32,589
Speaker 1: I'm not doing.

860
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:33,716
Speaker 1: it's like if I'm not comfortable.

861
01:03:33,776 --> 01:03:34,259
Speaker 1: I turn it on.

862
01:03:35,102 --> 01:03:36,025
Speaker 0: How are you like this?

863
01:03:36,406 --> 01:03:39,034
Speaker 0: and yet when it's like 71 degrees?

864
01:03:39,075 --> 01:03:40,078
Speaker 0: You're like, it's too cold.

865
01:03:40,118 --> 01:03:40,700
Speaker 0: I can't bike.

866
01:03:42,286 --> 01:03:45,540
Speaker 1: It is too cold Doesn't mean it's nice it's not too cold.

867
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:46,485
Speaker 1: I got to turn the heat on.

868
01:03:46,646 --> 01:03:50,665
Speaker 0: but I'm saying if it's it like I Bike I'll bike to work.

869
01:03:50,745 --> 01:03:54,597
Speaker 0: if it's like 50 degrees in shorts the t-shirt and be very comfortable.

870
01:03:54,898 --> 01:03:55,360
Speaker 1: That's cold.

871
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:59,840
Speaker 0: But how do you have such a wide operating range sitting in your house?

872
01:04:00,181 --> 01:04:05,720
Speaker 0: But if you're on a bike where you have a lot more control of your personal situation, you're suddenly like can't deal with anything.

873
01:04:06,645 --> 01:04:07,340
Speaker 0: I'm just curious.

874
01:04:09,845 --> 01:04:13,108
Speaker 1: Another thing is that you know The apartments that I happen to live in.

875
01:04:13,169 --> 01:04:19,700
Speaker 1: this one in the previous one, they're they're so insulated They were so insulated and they have large south-facing windows.

876
01:04:20,203 --> 01:04:22,398
Speaker 1: So the Sun comes in or I can put the curtains.

877
01:04:22,438 --> 01:04:24,058
Speaker 0: and well I talked about this on the show before.

878
01:04:24,078 --> 01:04:30,676
Speaker 0: but Remember like four or five years ago where our building like the boiler broke and we didn't have heat for like two weeks in the middle of the winter.

879
01:04:32,048 --> 01:04:41,242
Speaker 0: it took More than four days for it to start getting chilly in our apartment from when the heater broke just because the building is so Insulated.

880
01:04:42,026 --> 01:04:45,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like a you know, I'm not cold right now in the apartment.

881
01:04:45,721 --> 01:04:52,581
Speaker 0: We often in the fall will have to run the AC occasionally because it'll just get too hot in the building because the insulation Hmm.

882
01:04:53,324 --> 01:05:06,368
Speaker 1: So just one one little side note here this the apartment I'm in now has two bathrooms and it came with right as a luxury item that we've never used even one time Heated floors in the bathroom.

883
01:05:06,388 --> 01:05:07,212
Speaker 1: now you could imagine.

884
01:05:07,915 --> 01:05:09,907
Speaker 1: Oh get out of the bathroom Get out of the shower.

885
01:05:10,229 --> 01:05:11,680
Speaker 1: The floor is cold, right?

886
01:05:12,081 --> 01:05:13,988
Speaker 1: I mean, I always imagine that being in hotels if

887
01:05:14,089 --> 01:05:22,894
Speaker 0: I built a house like if I was rich and I had a house Like built from scratch that house would 100% have radiant floor heating

888
01:05:23,536 --> 01:05:27,000
Speaker 1: whole house, but oh, baby Yeah, let me it could be good the rest of the house.

889
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:33,480
Speaker 1: But in the bathroom we have it and we've never used it and I've never come out of the shower and had cold floor.

890
01:05:34,844 --> 01:05:40,813
Speaker 0: The floor under my feet here is Warm like actively warm because of the heat from the people living under us.

891
01:05:40,833 --> 01:05:42,880
Speaker 0: because this building is so freakin insulated, right?

892
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:44,727
Speaker 1: It's like there's absolutely like it's it.

893
01:05:44,767 --> 01:05:47,157
Speaker 1: they have the system to heat to special floor.

894
01:05:47,217 --> 01:05:47,920
Speaker 0: Why it's New York.

895
01:05:47,981 --> 01:05:49,100
Speaker 0: Your floors are all right heated.

896
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:52,090
Speaker 1: I've never needed it even once.

897
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:57,327
Speaker 1: and also one of them has like an error on the control Right and I asked the super.

898
01:05:57,408 --> 01:06:00,240
Speaker 1: I was like, hey, I'm not using this but like do you want to fix this?

899
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:02,375
Speaker 1: He's like, no those things are a piece of shit.

900
01:06:02,495 --> 01:06:06,053
Speaker 1: He's like, don't worry He won't charge you for it when you know, I feel like in an apartment.

901
01:06:06,234 --> 01:06:10,539
Speaker 0: that is just a stupid idea All told and it's literally only there because they can put it as a checkbox.

902
01:06:10,747 --> 01:06:13,233
Speaker 1: Yeah The other thing is I feel like if I did use it.

903
01:06:13,455 --> 01:06:15,303
Speaker 1: if I did use it It's like how much?

904
01:06:15,725 --> 01:06:17,692
Speaker 1: how much am I gonna pay for the electricity?

905
01:06:17,712 --> 01:06:19,860
Speaker 1: It takes to heat the bathroom floor, right?

906
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:23,320
Speaker 0: It's like see those are good for a house where you want.

907
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:27,000
Speaker 0: You don't want cold stops and you just want like a nice radiant warmth in the whole house.

908
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:28,224
Speaker 1: I think it would make sense.

909
01:06:28,324 --> 01:06:30,873
Speaker 1: If you had a big-ass luxury bathroom.

910
01:06:31,254 --> 01:06:31,816
Speaker 0: Give me a second.

911
01:06:31,836 --> 01:06:33,345
Speaker 0: There might be trouble in the other room One sec.

912
01:06:33,365 --> 01:06:33,670
Speaker 0: What's up?

913
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:38,224
Speaker 1: Yeah Did the heating explode?

914
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:41,154
Speaker 0: Oh water in the ceiling really cut the rest of the show show.

915
01:06:41,234 --> 01:06:42,698
Speaker 1: show up water in the ceiling.
