1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:16,479
Speaker 1: Well, for those of you who do not live in the United States or are unfamiliar with the ways of the United States and the history of the United States, well, we live there and today is July 4th and the Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4th.

2
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:17,920
Speaker 0: Take that, Albion.

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:20,578
Speaker 0: Give or take.

4
00:00:21,102 --> 00:00:21,231
Speaker 1: Yes.

5
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:30,374
Speaker 1: So, on July 4th, we don't have to go to work, we don't have to do anything, and usually there's a bunch of fireworks, but...

6
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:34,460
Speaker 0: It's been raining continuously for the last four hours.

7
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,340
Speaker 1: And fireworks don't work in the rain because they need fire, not water.

8
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,440
Speaker 1: That's why they're fireworks.

9
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,660
Speaker 1: They work with fire.

10
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,920
Speaker 1: They're not waterworks, which work with water.

11
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:51,020
Speaker 0: Also, while there are fireworks that would work just fine in the rain, the issue is more that there's not going to be anyone sitting outside in the rain to watch them.

12
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:51,980
Speaker 1: That's also true.

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:01:00,940
Speaker 1: So, we don't really feel like doing a full show because we're having a day of relaxing and whatever, but we can't do no show because we're too awesome for that.

14
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,900
Speaker 0: See, normally, we'd be on the beach right now.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,040
Speaker 0: The problem is, in America, we're generally pretty practical about our vacations and our holidays.

16
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:14,760
Speaker 0: So, if a holiday falls on a Thursday, we tend to move it to the Friday so we can have the three-day weekend.

17
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:20,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, Memorial Day is always a Monday, so that way we always take three-day weekend.

18
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,463
Speaker 1: You don't have this.

19
00:01:22,086 --> 00:01:25,960
Speaker 1: go to work Monday, get off Tuesday, then go to work Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

20
00:01:26,001 --> 00:01:26,779
Speaker 1: That just doesn't happen.

21
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,675
Speaker 1: It doesn't happen.

22
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,400
Speaker 0: But, you might notice, tonight's Wednesday.

23
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,820
Speaker 0: They couldn't really move it in either direction.

24
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:40,860
Speaker 0: They just kept it on Wednesday, and as a result, the majority of Americans went to work for two days, took today off, and are going to go to work for two more days.

25
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:46,555
Speaker 1: Actually, a lot of people just took vacation to get the five-day weekend or- I was gonna.

26
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:54,260
Speaker 1: They went on super vacation all week because now they can spend one less vacation day and still get the whole nine-day vacation.

27
00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:03,719
Speaker 0: If you want a min-max, you gotta take the Monday, Tuesday, or the Thursday, Friday off because then, for the price of two vacation days, you get a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday off.

28
00:02:04,143 --> 00:02:04,260
Speaker 1: Yep.

29
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,460
Speaker 1: But we didn't do that because we're using our vacation days for the Otakans, so- And our writer's retreat.

30
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:10,887
Speaker 1: Yep.

31
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,739
Speaker 1: So, it's just, you know, middle of the week, day off, nothing to do, so we're gonna do a special episode of Geek Nights.

32
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,860
Speaker 0: Now, special has special connotations when it comes to us.

33
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:25,260
Speaker 0: We haven't done one in a while, so we figure we should explain it, especially since we have a lot of new people, a lot of new faces in the forums.

34
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:31,433
Speaker 1: If this is your first time listening to Geek Nights, this is not a normal episode of Geek Nights.

35
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,780
Speaker 1: It does not follow the standard Geek Nights format.

36
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:37,600
Speaker 1: It is just us talking for about a half hour about something.

37
00:02:38,844 --> 00:02:40,460
Speaker 1: We don't have our usual things of the day.

38
00:02:40,886 --> 00:02:41,799
Speaker 1: We don't have news.

39
00:02:42,201 --> 00:02:52,560
Speaker 1: We don't have anything we usually do, so if you want to get familiar with the show, you should go and listen to some other episode, almost any other episode that does not have the word "special" in the title.

40
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,778
Speaker 0: Yep, pretty much.

41
00:02:54,140 --> 00:03:00,520
Speaker 0: Listen to any Tuesday night show if you want to hear about gaming, Wednesday for anime and all that, but feel free to check out any particular episode.

42
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,079
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

43
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,380
Speaker 0: Pick a topic you like.

44
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,119
Speaker 1: And if you're already a Geek Nights listener, well, this is all you're getting today, so deal with it.

45
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,020
Speaker 0: Though, there was a lot of anime news, and I really want to talk about it, but I'll save.

46
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:19,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot of news coming out of the Anime Expo, a whole bunch of licenses, news about Anime Expo itself, all sorts of stuff, but we're not gonna talk about it now.

47
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,120
Speaker 1: We're gonna wait for everything to chill out, and for all the facts to settle, and then we'll talk about it.

48
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,100
Speaker 0: Rest assured, we're gonna have the Anime Expo news extravaganza next week.

49
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,000
Speaker 1: Even though we've never been to Anime Expo, and I don't imagine we'll go there anytime soon.

50
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:42,820
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is, I'll go to Anime Expo if I am going to the West Coast for a con, and I'm already going to PAX and the San Diego Comic Con.

51
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:57,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, and in order for me to go to those, it's like, well, I guess you could go to Anime Expo and San Diego, because they're within the same month, so you could make it one big trip, but that would be so many vacation days to make up the weeks in between the two weekends.

52
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,760
Speaker 0: That's the kind of time when, for me, I just quit my job and then start a new one at the end of the vacation.

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, they're both four-day conventions, right?

54
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:05,639
Speaker 1: So I don't know, it's tough.

55
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:11,139
Speaker 1: You'd have to take the whole month of July off, and then you'd still need the month of August off to go to PAX.

56
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,520
Speaker 0: But if I'm gonna take a month off, I'd rather just go to Turkey or something.

57
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,598
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna go around the US.

58
00:04:15,925 --> 00:04:16,160
Speaker 0: Yeah.

59
00:04:17,046 --> 00:04:17,620
Speaker 1: Why Turkey?

60
00:04:18,402 --> 00:04:19,140
Speaker 1: It's sort of random.

61
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,099
Speaker 0: Actually, no, I've been thinking about going to Turkey for some time now.

62
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,938
Speaker 0: I want to see all the old Byzantine stuff.

63
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:35,140
Speaker 1: And that Byzantine emperor guy, the Turkish, like, you know, I guess, whoever, the Turkish Board of Tourism should hire him, because he's encouraging Turkish tourism.

64
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,959
Speaker 0: Well, actually, Emily was telling me that apparently there's been a big push for tourism to Turkey.

65
00:04:39,261 --> 00:04:40,360
Speaker 1: They've got some cool stuff there.

66
00:04:40,562 --> 00:04:41,878
Speaker 1: You can get a Turkish shave.

67
00:04:43,982 --> 00:04:47,040
Speaker 0: The thing is, we can go there pretty cheaply, a lot cheaper than we could go to Europe.

68
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I want to see castles.

69
00:04:49,202 --> 00:04:49,840
Speaker 0: There's castles.

70
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there are different kinds of castles.

71
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're better, far superior, much cooler.

72
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,358
Speaker 0: Let's see, let's see.

73
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:02,280
Speaker 0: On one hand, we have the decaying remains of the Roman Empire, one of the greatest empires in the history of humanity.

74
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,500
Speaker 1: We can go see that in Rome.

75
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,780
Speaker 0: It's not the same, because the Byzantines held on, they kept going, and they had the Greek influence.

76
00:05:09,465 --> 00:05:11,459
Speaker 1: We can go to Greece and Athens.

77
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,618
Speaker 0: You realize that most of the original Greek city-states, nothing remains of what was there, just about.

78
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:17,940
Speaker 1: Parthenon.

79
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:18,999
Speaker 0: Yeah, but not so much.

80
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,079
Speaker 0: There's a lot more Byzantine stuff left.

81
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:21,939
Speaker 1: We can go to Cyprus.

82
00:05:22,801 --> 00:05:23,759
Speaker 0: I would like to go to Cyprus.

83
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,359
Speaker 1: We could also go to the Carcassonne.

84
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:33,400
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure, though, we are not the first people who will play Carcassonne at the Carcassonne.

85
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,300
Speaker 1: However, I think someone has beat us to it.

86
00:05:35,521 --> 00:05:44,040
Speaker 0: While I saw someone took his set of Amun-Re and took a picture of his pharaoh next to the Great Pyramid, I have not seen anyone take pictures of meeples standing in the Carcassonne.

87
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:49,100
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure someone's done it, but I haven't seen it yet, but it's got to be done.

88
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:54,520
Speaker 0: I never really knew it was a real specific place until Richard- We should go to Iraq and with our takers and your fraides.

89
00:05:56,203 --> 00:05:57,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, Iraq's the place we want to be.

90
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,033
Speaker 0: Yeah.

91
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:05,820
Speaker 0: You know, actually, as a CS guy and an IT guy, we could spend like six months there and make our annual salary four times over.

92
00:06:06,362 --> 00:06:08,000
Speaker 0: And the odds of dying are pretty low.

93
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,219
Speaker 1: They are pretty low, but they're much higher than they are for me right now.

94
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,798
Speaker 0: See, I work in the Bronx, so.

95
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,460
Speaker 1: It's still not even close to Iraq.

96
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:20,760
Speaker 1: Anyway, today for our special episode, we're going to talk about anime marathons.

97
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:25,380
Speaker 0: You see, we've mentioned offhand all these marathons we've done in the past.

98
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,200
Speaker 0: And we speak of them very highly, but we always kind of offhanded.

99
00:06:28,441 --> 00:06:29,860
Speaker 0: They're like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

100
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, like when we marathoned Ava the second time.

101
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,439
Speaker 0: We never really went into detail about that.

102
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:49,360
Speaker 1: Basically, what it comes down to is that anime, traditionally, when you have a Japanese animated TV series, it's serial in that all the episodes go in order and tell one larger story.

103
00:06:49,882 --> 00:06:53,500
Speaker 1: So you want to watch all the episodes in order to get the big picture.

104
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,800
Speaker 1: However, there are 26 almost 30 minute episodes on usually.

105
00:06:58,901 --> 00:07:00,860
Speaker 1: I mean, some series are longer, some are shorter.

106
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,840
Speaker 1: You know, some episodes are longer, some are shorter.

107
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:08,879
Speaker 1: But you've got in general, most of the shows are 26 episodes and about almost a half hour per episode.

108
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:15,336
Speaker 1: That means you've got to sit there for 12 hours or so if you want to watch the whole show.

109
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,920
Speaker 1: Now you can watch an episode a day, which is how I watch Macross TV.

110
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,480
Speaker 0: It's how we watch most anime nowadays.

111
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:20,897
Speaker 0: Yeah.

112
00:07:21,301 --> 00:07:23,600
Speaker 1: You can watch episodes as they come out every week.

113
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:24,840
Speaker 1: That's not so bad either.

114
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:33,820
Speaker 1: But if a show is already out on DVD in full, and you have the box set, why not just sit there for 12 hours and watch the whole thing?

115
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,060
Speaker 0: Now the key benefits of this are very simple.

116
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:45,578
Speaker 0: Number one, there's always the problem of, you know, me and Scott have seen this blah blah whatever show, but Alex hasn't.

117
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,059
Speaker 0: So we lend it to Alex, and then all of us have seen it.

118
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,337
Speaker 0: But oh, Pete hasn't seen it.

119
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:53,540
Speaker 0: But maybe Katsu's seen half of it, and Adam's seen the end but not the beginning.

120
00:07:54,103 --> 00:07:58,539
Speaker 0: And we have kind of everyone's at a different state, so we can never really talk about the show or anything.

121
00:07:59,281 --> 00:08:03,654
Speaker 0: So as a result, the best thing to do is to get everyone together and watch the show in one shot.

122
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,480
Speaker 0: And then we know you've all seen it all.

123
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,700
Speaker 0: We can talk about it right then.

124
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,960
Speaker 1: Everyone's seen it in order.

125
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,199
Speaker 1: Everyone's seen every episode.

126
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,520
Speaker 1: Nothing's missing.

127
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,254
Speaker 1: You know, it's all good.

128
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:18,620
Speaker 0: Now two is just the fact that watching a show in marathon format is awesome.

129
00:08:18,761 --> 00:08:21,040
Speaker 0: But we'll get into that with a bunch of anecdotal evidence.

130
00:08:21,522 --> 00:08:27,940
Speaker 1: Well, it's watching a show all at once is a very different experience than watching it, you know, in separate pieces.

131
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:47,059
Speaker 0: You start to notice a lot of things like a show like Ava, Ava, for example, if you watch it in its normal format, like once a week or even less often, depending on when the DVDs were coming out or when you were watching it, it's real easy to not notice correlations between subtle things that happened in one episode and subtle related things that happened in another episode.

132
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:55,260
Speaker 1: Yes, like if someone does it, like if there's like a little visual cue or something and it's repeated often, like once per episode or something like that.

133
00:08:55,561 --> 00:08:56,080
Speaker 0: Like a new antenna.

134
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:56,455
Speaker 1: Yeah.

135
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,300
Speaker 1: You won't notice it if you just see it once a week.

136
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:08,380
Speaker 1: Like it's the kind of thing where if you watch an episode of a show and then you wait, you're going to only remember like the, you know, the big things you're going to remember.

137
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:08,700
Speaker 1: Okay.

138
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:09,699
Speaker 1: What happened last time?

139
00:09:09,905 --> 00:09:10,320
Speaker 1: All right.

140
00:09:10,581 --> 00:09:20,340
Speaker 1: That robot fought that robot and that guy died and that spaceship crashed and that you're not going to remember the little details like, oh yeah, it faded to pink and then blue.

141
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:29,160
Speaker 1: And then it made this noise, you know, about halfway through the show or yeah, played that song when that person appeared every time in the background very quietly.

142
00:09:29,642 --> 00:09:44,320
Speaker 1: But if you watch the show in a marathon, what ends up happening is you sort of lose something and gain something you don't, what you lose is that the episode, the episodes blur together because you're not allowing the events to sink in after watching them.

143
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:50,511
Speaker 1: It just sort of runs into this one giant epic and you can't really tell where one begins and where one ends.

144
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:50,998
Speaker 1: very well.

145
00:09:51,840 --> 00:10:04,379
Speaker 1: But when there's subtle things that happen very often, you're bombarded with them constantly over these hours and hours, you know, and you go, Hey, I see that all the fricking time that just keeps happening there.

146
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:04,971
Speaker 1: Look at that.

147
00:10:05,741 --> 00:10:10,140
Speaker 0: Plus, I mean, aside from all that meta, it just comes down to, for me watching a show like that.

148
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,520
Speaker 0: I mean, I like to watch an epic, uh, Lord of the Rings.

149
00:10:12,942 --> 00:10:24,420
Speaker 0: I, other than the fact that I don't have enough free time, if my free time itself were not a factor, I would have preferred to just waited and seen all of the Lord of the Rings in one shot at once without having to wait between the movies.

150
00:10:25,161 --> 00:10:29,560
Speaker 0: Uh, I have no problem with watching a four, eight, 12 hour epic in one day.

151
00:10:30,182 --> 00:10:32,680
Speaker 1: Well, it depends on exactly what it is I'm watching.

152
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:42,200
Speaker 1: You know, there are some things where I think because the experience of watching like the same exact thing in marathon form or in separated form is completely different.

153
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:48,660
Speaker 1: It's sort of like if you read a comic book one issue at a time every month, or you just wait for the trade, the experience is completely different.

154
00:10:48,861 --> 00:10:50,840
Speaker 0: It really depends on what kind of anime it is.

155
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,640
Speaker 0: I mean, Ava Eska, a show that has a straight contiguous plot, no filler, and it's just, you know, the plot is progressing continuously.

156
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:01,259
Speaker 0: There's not a lot of recap, nothing like that.

157
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,980
Speaker 0: Those shows are absolutely perfect for a marathon, but they sure are.

158
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,260
Speaker 0: But a show like, I don't know, Lupin the third, not good for a marathon.

159
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,340
Speaker 0: There's no plot.

160
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,420
Speaker 0: It's completely episodic.

161
00:11:11,621 --> 00:11:13,027
Speaker 0: The marathon is just going to fall apart.

162
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:20,280
Speaker 0: or Magic Knight, Gray Earth, which while I like it a little, it's also really long and really repetitive.

163
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,020
Speaker 1: But there are even some shorter shows that aren't good for marathoning.

164
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,340
Speaker 1: You know, it's not just the length.

165
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,740
Speaker 1: I mean, obviously, a show that's too long, like hundreds of episodes.

166
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,940
Speaker 0: No, I also said repetitive.

167
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, like One Piece, not good for marathons.

168
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:37,040
Speaker 1: But also, there are some 13 episode shows out there not so good for marathons.

169
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:41,220
Speaker 0: But then there's like El Hazzard, the original OAV, awesome for marathons.

170
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:53,279
Speaker 1: OAVs are typically always awesome for marathons because they're usually a lot shorter than a 26 episode series, but they also have a contiguous plot over like three or four 45 minute episodes.

171
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,659
Speaker 1: You know, so it's like, oh yeah, gonna rock that.

172
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:05,399
Speaker 0: Now, the reason we brought this up is just that we were thinking a lot about RIT and back in the day, and we remembered that one of our favorite pastimes, and we did this relatively often.

173
00:12:05,842 --> 00:12:16,600
Speaker 0: See, RIT, there were tunnels connecting all the dorms, and on a weekend in the winter when it's cold outside and no one has classes, you could do everything you needed to do for the entire weekend.

174
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:17,580
Speaker 1: Without going outside.

175
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,040
Speaker 0: From Friday morning, because no one had classes on a Friday ever.

176
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:25,020
Speaker 0: I mean, unless you were dumb, I never had a class on a Friday.

177
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:46,951
Speaker 0: But you pretty much from Friday morning until Monday morning, you did not have to set foot outside once, and yet, you could get to restaurants, you could get, well, there wasn't any more, but there used to be a bar over there, the arcades, get your mail, go to all the little grocery stores in the area, we could all meet in the dorms, we could break into one of the office-y areas and play board games, you could

178
00:12:46,971 --> 00:12:48,540
Speaker 1: do all sorts of crazy stuff down there.

179
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:59,519
Speaker 0: So oftentimes, if we were bored, especially freshman year, especially because we were all freshmen at RIT, and we were all into anime, but a lot of us hadn't seen the big name shows.

180
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:11,096
Speaker 0: Like when we realized that a full half the group hadn't seen Escaflowne, or hadn't seen Cowboy Bebop, we say, "Alright, next weekend, starting Saturday morning, we're gonna watch the first half, and then Sunday we're gonna watch the

181
00:13:11,136 --> 00:13:11,358
Speaker 0: rest.".

182
00:13:11,984 --> 00:13:13,579
Speaker 1: And we did exactly that.

183
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,660
Speaker 0: Well, I'd put on the same pair of pajamas and just wear it all weekend long.

184
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,027
Speaker 0: Yep.

185
00:13:18,002 --> 00:13:19,000
Speaker 1: Ah, those were good times.

186
00:13:19,161 --> 00:13:21,060
Speaker 1: Now, I don't have time for that anymore.

187
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:27,137
Speaker 1: I got podcasts, I got a real job that takes all day, I got all kinds of stuff in no time for marathoning.

188
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,099
Speaker 0: See, there's something really special about it, and you win out even if you've seen the anime before.

189
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:40,520
Speaker 0: Because if you're a newbie and you haven't seen Ava, now you're watching Ava with a whole bunch of people who, one, can answer questions if you really don't understand something.

190
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,294
Speaker 0: Even though the answer is usually, "Watch the

191
00:13:43,335 --> 00:13:43,616
Speaker 0: show.".

192
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,051
Speaker 0: What are you asking me?

193
00:13:45,072 --> 00:13:45,720
Speaker 0: to spoil it for you?

194
00:13:45,821 --> 00:13:46,298
Speaker 0: Watch the show.

195
00:13:46,985 --> 00:13:47,660
Speaker 0: It'll be explained.

196
00:13:47,942 --> 00:13:48,399
Speaker 0: Just watch it.

197
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:48,918
Speaker 0: You'll figure it out.

198
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, my mom is big on asking questions while watching movies.

199
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,177
Speaker 0: What's going on?

200
00:13:52,461 --> 00:13:53,559
Speaker 0: Who's that guy in the mask?

201
00:13:53,844 --> 00:13:54,558
Speaker 0: Is that the murderer?

202
00:13:54,841 --> 00:14:01,619
Speaker 1: Even if you watch a movie with my mom that no one in the theater on opening night should be like, "Why is that?

203
00:14:02,201 --> 00:14:02,949
Speaker 1: What is that over

204
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:03,415
Speaker 1: there?".

205
00:14:03,981 --> 00:14:05,859
Speaker 1: And you're like, "Uh, just watch.

206
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:06,628
Speaker 1: You'll find

207
00:14:06,851 --> 00:14:06,972
Speaker 1: out.".

208
00:14:07,702 --> 00:14:09,319
Speaker 0: But you get the group experience and all that.

209
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,798
Speaker 0: But even if you've seen the anime before, because I had already seen Ava twice before we marathoned it.

210
00:14:15,181 --> 00:14:17,019
Speaker 1: I had seen it once before we marathoned it.

211
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:22,937
Speaker 0: So while I had seen it a bunch of times, I already knew a lot about it, and I put a lot of thought into the show.

212
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:34,639
Speaker 0: Watching how other people reacted to scenes that I knew were coming up and watching someone else realize certain things that the show went on was almost as enjoyable as watching the show by myself the first time.

213
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,439
Speaker 1: I don't know why that's enjoyable, but it definitely is.

214
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:45,440
Speaker 1: Part of it is- When I was watching you play Half-Life 2, and you got to some parts, and I knew the whole game because I've played it through one and a half times.

215
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,918
Speaker 1: And just watching you go through the same experience was like, "Ooh, he's gonna get to this part, OMG.

216
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:51,774
Speaker 0: What's he gonna

217
00:14:51,794 --> 00:14:51,877
Speaker 0: do?".

218
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,340
Speaker 0: Part of it is you relive the experience.

219
00:14:53,980 --> 00:15:03,420
Speaker 0: Remember the scene in Ava where the one robot eats the thing and then the crazy plot happens and you learn something scary and that everything happens, not to spoil anything.

220
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:09,115
Speaker 0: That scene put chills through me when I first saw it, and I was just in awe of, "Wow, what kind of show is

221
00:15:09,136 --> 00:15:09,299
Speaker 0: this?".

222
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,400
Speaker 0: That wasn't what I expected.

223
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,720
Speaker 0: This is, wow.

224
00:15:11,923 --> 00:15:12,919
Speaker 1: I expected that, though.

225
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,440
Speaker 0: But still, the way they did it, a chill went down my spine.

226
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:22,980
Speaker 0: And I remember watching a friend of ours who hadn't seen the show before, and they reacted the same way when that scene happened.

227
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,600
Speaker 0: And on one hand, I relived my experience.

228
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,232
Speaker 0: On the other hand, I felt validated in that, "All right, that was a moment that really stuck out to

229
00:15:31,273 --> 00:15:31,375
Speaker 0: me.".

230
00:15:31,841 --> 00:15:34,980
Speaker 0: And wow, this person had the same reaction to that scene.

231
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:40,020
Speaker 1: Maybe that is something because if I just play, let's say I just watch Ava again, right?

232
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,139
Speaker 1: It's not gonna be the same experience for me if I just watch it again.

233
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:50,200
Speaker 1: But if I watch someone else watch it again, then it's sort of like the first time, even though it's not exactly the first time.

234
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:54,740
Speaker 1: It's sort of like, I guess, re-versionizing yourself in a way.

235
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,218
Speaker 1: But it is.

236
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,840
Speaker 1: Not completely, just in a small way.

237
00:15:56,982 --> 00:15:57,337
Speaker 0: It works.

238
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:57,938
Speaker 0: It works.

239
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:04,580
Speaker 0: It's like, I think part of it, too, is especially if you're watching, say, when Scott Johnson showed us all Cowboy Bebop way back.

240
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:13,619
Speaker 0: That was one of the defining moments in our lives because Scott Johnson, a good friend of ours now, was kind of one of the people who ran the anime club, and he was kind of Well, he didn't.

241
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,640
Speaker 1: See, that was kind of weird.

242
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,140
Speaker 1: I remember.

243
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,540
Speaker 1: Oh, he didn't really, but we thought he did.

244
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,400
Speaker 1: I remember in freshman year, we always saw this guy who was always up there at the front of the anime club.

245
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,092
Speaker 1: And I was like, "Who's that

246
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:22,378
Speaker 1: guy?".

247
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,400
Speaker 1: And he was that guy that was up at the front of the anime club that didn't say anything, and I didn't know who he was, but I kept seeing him.

248
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:35,580
Speaker 0: Now, we knew he was cool, and we assumed that he was the one who really ran the club because he seemed like he was always there and always kind of in charge from the shadows.

249
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,100
Speaker 1: But really, he wasn't on that board or anything.

250
00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:39,700
Speaker 0: He was just friends with everyone on the board.

251
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,780
Speaker 1: He was just Scott Johnson.

252
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,417
Speaker 1: That's all he was.

253
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:47,260
Speaker 0: Of course, he then went on, due to the political intrigue, to become president, and then I became president, but that's beside the point.

254
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,620
Speaker 1: But besides the point, freshman year, there was a show, Cowboy Bebop.

255
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,539
Speaker 1: I didn't even know the show, Cowboy Bebop, existed until I went to RIT.

256
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,520
Speaker 0: I had seen Episode 5, the fight between Spike and Vicious.

257
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,320
Speaker 1: I saw Episode 5 at the first anime club meeting ever.

258
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,180
Speaker 1: As did I. And I knew that it was awesome.

259
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,739
Speaker 1: But I never actually got around to watching it.

260
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,758
Speaker 1: And then Scott Johnson said, "All right, I'm having an official anime club, Cowboy Bebop marathon.

261
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:13,278
Speaker 1: Come to this building this weekend on these two days, and we'll watch the whole

262
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:13,539
Speaker 1: thing.".

263
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:14,940
Speaker 1: And that's what we did.

264
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:22,680
Speaker 0: Honestly, pretty much, that was one of the earliest front row crew moments, because the front row crew, like the original core of it, all went to this marathon.

265
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,758
Speaker 0: And then we became friends with Scott Johnson, because he was the man who gave us Cowboy Bebop.

266
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:27,858
Speaker 1: That he was.

267
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:32,320
Speaker 0: And I gotta say, Cowboy Bebop is probably the absolute perfect show to marathon.

268
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:43,400
Speaker 1: Well, I think the problem with Cowboy Bebop is that if you have all of it at your disposal in a DVD box set, and you have time to kill, and you begin watching, it's very difficult to stop watching.

269
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,959
Speaker 0: We experimentally verified this.

270
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:45,877
Speaker 0: Was it Pete?

271
00:17:46,343 --> 00:17:46,718
Speaker 1: It was Alex.

272
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,299
Speaker 0: It was Alex.

273
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,020
Speaker 0: Someone hadn't seen Cowboy Bebop all the way through.

274
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:50,515
Speaker 0: Yep.

275
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,680
Speaker 0: Like, they'd seen a little bit of it.

276
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,420
Speaker 0: And it was me and Scott and that person.

277
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,280
Speaker 1: It was you, me, and Alex in Colony.

278
00:17:55,463 --> 00:17:55,860
Speaker 1: I remember.

279
00:17:56,101 --> 00:17:57,559
Speaker 0: I don't know why I remember it being Pete.

280
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:58,640
Speaker 1: I don't know either.

281
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,619
Speaker 0: Well, I'm sure Alex and Pete can inform us which one of them it was.

282
00:18:02,342 --> 00:18:06,840
Speaker 1: I'm 90% sure it was me, you, and Alex in Colony late at night after getting back from something.

283
00:18:07,561 --> 00:18:11,320
Speaker 0: No, we were back from vacation waiting for everyone else to get back into town.

284
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,379
Speaker 1: I think that was it, yes.

285
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:19,196
Speaker 0: Anyway, so we're going to lend it to the person, like, "Here, we'll watch the first couple episodes of Cowboy Bebop while we do this stuff, and then you can borrow the

286
00:18:19,236 --> 00:18:19,457
Speaker 0: rest.".

287
00:18:20,121 --> 00:18:22,018
Speaker 0: And then we just kept watching it.

288
00:18:22,282 --> 00:18:22,920
Speaker 1: Until it was over.

289
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,660
Speaker 0: And we just kept watching it, and then it ended.

290
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,740
Speaker 0: We were all sitting there staring at the screen after the last episode.

291
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,320
Speaker 0: And then I think it was Scott who said, "So much for our weekend.

292
00:18:32,901 --> 00:18:33,774
Speaker 0: We just watched Cowboy

293
00:18:33,815 --> 00:18:34,119
Speaker 0: Bebop.".

294
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:38,132
Speaker 1: I think we actually sort of, I think we might've watched it from like 1 p.m.

295
00:18:38,152 --> 00:18:39,115
Speaker 1: to 2 a.m.

296
00:18:39,135 --> 00:18:41,437
Speaker 1: or something like that.

297
00:18:41,702 --> 00:18:43,520
Speaker 1: And thus, it really didn't kill the whole weekend.

298
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,900
Speaker 0: It was entirely unexpected, though.

299
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,357
Speaker 1: It was like 12 hours, so...

300
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,439
Speaker 0: We accidentally marathoned Cowboy Bebop.

301
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:55,100
Speaker 1: I know, it's like 12 hours, you know, you think that's a long time, but really, if you start watching at like noon, you'll be done at midnight.

302
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,780
Speaker 1: That's not really that long if you stop to eat.

303
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,112
Speaker 0: Yep.

304
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:13,000
Speaker 0: Plus, I mean, the shows like Cowboy Bebop and actually really, Escaflowne, because those two shows have this thing where the show is really good and draws you along, and Escaflowne has the additional bonus of every third or fourth episode ends on a cliffhanger.

305
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:26,260
Speaker 1: That's the other thing about marathons, is that cliffhangers completely lose most of their effect, because while, you know, the cliffhanger event happens, and the event itself still has the impact, you don't have the pain of having to wait to see what happens next.

306
00:19:26,502 --> 00:19:28,279
Speaker 1: You just have to switch DVDs and you're off.

307
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:38,806
Speaker 0: I remember when I was in high school, and every month we bought, the day it came out, our friend Ken bought the next VHS tape of Escaflowne, and we then immediately watched it.

308
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,579
Speaker 0: Like, literally, he'd show up and we'd watch the whole thing.

309
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:52,260
Speaker 0: And I'm not gonna spoil anything, but the seventh, seven out of eight VHS tape of Escaflowne ends in one of the worst cliffhangers in all of anime.

310
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,461
Speaker 1: Yep, definitely, I agree 100%.

311
00:19:54,461 --> 00:20:02,040
Speaker 0: And I remember sitting there, and then Dan Greer, a good friend of mine, turns and says, "You know, we have to wait a full month before we find out what the fuck was up with that,

312
00:20:02,121 --> 00:20:02,347
Speaker 0: right?".

313
00:20:03,146 --> 00:20:04,020
Speaker 1: It sucks ass.

314
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:10,380
Speaker 0: Yes, that month took longer than much of the rest of my life to live through.

315
00:20:12,162 --> 00:20:14,960
Speaker 0: Of course, the anecdote I was getting to with that.

316
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:25,820
Speaker 0: So we're marathoning, no, we'll do the whole story, we're marathoning Escaflowne at RIT in like, Sol 9, on the fancy TV in the nice lounge in the renovated building.

317
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:40,734
Speaker 0: And of course, actually, we met one of our friends, Lara, who didn't really know her at all, this is a girl we'd seen, and she was walking by with her friends, and she saw that a bunch of geeks are watching an anime, and she kind of likes anime, so she brings all her friends in, like, "Can I

318
00:20:40,755 --> 00:20:41,019
Speaker 0: watch?".

319
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,288
Speaker 0: And all of us think,

320
00:20:42,772 --> 00:20:43,195
Speaker 0: "Agoil.".

321
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:46,680
Speaker 1: What, we all became Popeye all of a sudden?

322
00:20:47,841 --> 00:20:52,453
Speaker 0: So of course, we say, "Yeah, sit down, we're watching Escaflowne, you just missed the first three episodes, here's what you missed, let's

323
00:20:52,473 --> 00:20:52,614
Speaker 0: go.".

324
00:20:53,561 --> 00:20:58,220
Speaker 0: And after about two episodes, her friends are like, "Wait a minute, are you gonna watch this whole thing?

325
00:20:58,302 --> 00:20:58,797
Speaker 0: How long is

326
00:20:58,838 --> 00:20:58,879
Speaker 0: it?".

327
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,398
Speaker 0: And we're like, "Uh, 12 hours, give or

328
00:21:01,438 --> 00:21:01,640
Speaker 0: take?".

329
00:21:01,943 --> 00:21:03,217
Speaker 0: And they're like, "Aw man, this sucks, let's

330
00:21:03,257 --> 00:21:03,419
Speaker 0: go.".

331
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:10,019
Speaker 0: And Lara said, "I'm staying," and she became a member of the front row crew pretty much right then and there.

332
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:10,453
Speaker 1: Yep.

333
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:19,880
Speaker 1: If you do a marathon in a semi-public space, and people see what you're doing, it sort of acts like a geek magnet sometimes, it's pretty useful.

334
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:31,400
Speaker 0: So we didn't have all the box set with us, it was kind of scattered around, so it was all in other people's dorm rooms, and we'd go and get them one at a time, between DVDs, to give people a chance to go to pee and get snacks.

335
00:21:31,441 --> 00:21:32,636
Speaker 1: I think you were watching VHSes.

336
00:21:33,284 --> 00:21:34,440
Speaker 0: We might have been, I don't remember.

337
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,060
Speaker 1: I think we were.

338
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, we were, because we got it from the anime club.

339
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:45,220
Speaker 0: Anyway, so we have Up Through Seven, we don't have Tape Eight with us physically, it's on another floor of the building.

340
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,950
Speaker 0: Tape Seven ends, and everyone goes,

341
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:48,050
Speaker 0: "Whoa."

342
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:50,660
Speaker 0: Yep.

343
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:56,760
Speaker 0: And then we sit there for a second, and I choose not to say anything, and Ken chooses not to say anything, because we've seen the show before, we know what happens.

344
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:02,858
Speaker 0: So we just sit there, until eventually everyone goes, "Go get the tape, go get it,

345
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:03,219
Speaker 0: now!".

346
00:22:03,941 --> 00:22:11,980
Speaker 0: So we go, we get in the elevator, and we go down, and we get it, and we go, we're on our way back up, and the elevator just stops.

347
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,940
Speaker 1: The elevator got stuck at that time.

348
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,880
Speaker 0: The elevator got stuck.

349
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:20,280
Speaker 1: Not lying, the elevator actually got stuck with the eighth tape inside of it.

350
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:33,838
Speaker 0: So me and Ken, and these two other people who we didn't know, are standing there with the tape, and I turned, and I think he's the one who said, "You know, it's probably ironic that the two people who've seen the show are in this elevator with the

351
00:22:33,879 --> 00:22:34,079
Speaker 0: tape.".

352
00:22:34,904 --> 00:22:35,115
Speaker 0: Yeah.

353
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:45,057
Speaker 0: And then we're musing, "I wonder what they're doing, I wonder if they're looking for us, I wonder how long they can wait, I wonder if they're just gonna go out, break into the media play, and steal the last VHS

354
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:45,300
Speaker 0: tape.".

355
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:53,320
Speaker 1: Well I guess that is a way to simulate the experience of having to wait for the cliffhanger, and it was slightly painful, but it wasn't so bad.

356
00:22:53,521 --> 00:22:55,640
Speaker 1: I imagine your month wait was much worse.

357
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,880
Speaker 0: For me it was just hilarious.

358
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:01,780
Speaker 1: It was like- But then again, I have an easier time waiting for cliffhangers than most people.

359
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:03,138
Speaker 1: It doesn't bother me so much.

360
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:09,358
Speaker 0: See, they don't bother me so much, but that particular cliffhanger, just because of- That is one of the roughest there is.

361
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,819
Speaker 0: Because I can't spoil it, I can't even talk about it.

362
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:13,529
Speaker 0: Yes.

363
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:19,013
Speaker 1: But yeah, if nothing else- It's more like a space station hanger, you're hanging that far.

364
00:23:20,764 --> 00:23:28,437
Speaker 0: I think the moral is simply, if you marathon anime, anime marathons, especially in colleges, are basically anecdote magnets.

365
00:23:29,602 --> 00:23:32,440
Speaker 0: Something is going to happen, you're gonna have a story to tell afterwards.

366
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:41,440
Speaker 1: Spending 12 hours in a room with a group of people, as a sequential work of art plays nonstop is like a recipe for awesome.

367
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,360
Speaker 0: Plus, I mean, my favorite moment in any marathon ever was still at the end of Cowboy Bebop.

368
00:23:46,682 --> 00:23:48,534
Speaker 0: Because it was a shared experience of like 20, 25 people.

369
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,840
Speaker 0: And all of us watched this amazing work of art from start to finish, and it ended.

370
00:23:56,741 --> 00:23:59,800
Speaker 0: And we all sat there as the closing credits played and finished.

371
00:24:00,201 --> 00:24:02,960
Speaker 0: And then it was just a black screen with the projector just sitting there in idle.

372
00:24:03,602 --> 00:24:05,479
Speaker 0: And for a good five minutes, no one said a word.

373
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,444
Speaker 0: Everyone just sat there like-.

374
00:24:07,845 --> 00:24:12,676
Speaker 0: The silence was palpable and painful, and no one had the balls to break it.

375
00:24:13,144 --> 00:24:13,337
Speaker 0: Nope.

376
00:24:13,882 --> 00:24:25,640
Speaker 1: I noticed that at the end of a lot of shows, and even just watching a 90 minute movie, if it's a serious kind of movie, people just do not have the balls to be the first person to say something.

377
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:29,540
Speaker 0: But a marathon is so much more, it's kind of like when we talked about Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.

378
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,298
Speaker 0: The game itself was kind of meh.

379
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:39,060
Speaker 0: But because we played the game in marathon format, we took an otherwise mediocre game and turned it into this shared experience.

380
00:24:39,801 --> 00:24:42,900
Speaker 0: Because it went on so long, I mean it took longer than watching any anime.

381
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,840
Speaker 0: That was a long time to game.

382
00:24:45,021 --> 00:24:45,397
Speaker 1: It did, it did.

383
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,700
Speaker 1: It took like all weekend.

384
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,860
Speaker 1: It took like twenty, like eighteen- Like Friday night, it took like all Friday, all Saturday, and all Sunday.

385
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:52,588
Speaker 0: Yep.

386
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,020
Speaker 0: Pretty much nonstop with a short break to sleep after Katsu fell asleep and ran away with the bus.

387
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,160
Speaker 1: We slept a little bit Friday and a little bit Saturday.

388
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,840
Speaker 0: And we stopped to go to a hockey game, but at the hockey game we couldn't stop talking about Crystal Chronicles.

389
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,999
Speaker 1: Well we were strategizing about what we were going to do next.

390
00:25:07,302 --> 00:25:08,975
Speaker 1: Like yeah, we're going to go back there and then...

391
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:19,909
Speaker 0: But the thing is, it's weird how if you take humans and put them in a shared experience that takes that much time, there's this level of bonding that you can't really get any other way.

392
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:25,400
Speaker 0: And like the experience, like I don't remember, I remember Cowboy Bebop as an experience.

393
00:25:25,842 --> 00:25:29,459
Speaker 0: But I remember it colored by the shared experience of the people I watched it with.

394
00:25:30,283 --> 00:25:32,380
Speaker 0: And I feel like it was a greater experience as a result.

395
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:39,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just, I remember the room and I remember the people in there and I remember everyone was laying on all, because it was the chemistry lecture hall.

396
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,979
Speaker 0: I remember when the crazy guy pulled out his Airsoft MP5 and threatened to kill you.

397
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,640
Speaker 1: Yep, yep, that was pretty...

398
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,920
Speaker 0: That was a funny story for another time.

399
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,980
Speaker 1: And then we switched up to the dubs as soon as we got to the Mushroom episode.

400
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:49,713
Speaker 0: Oh man.

401
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:54,216
Speaker 1: Because the Mushroom episode actually is one of the few anime where the dub is better than the sub.

402
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,403
Speaker 1: So when we got to the Mushroom episode, we switched to the dub and then we liked it so much.

403
00:25:58,423 --> 00:25:59,819
Speaker 1: we stayed with the dub through to the end.

404
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:06,551
Speaker 0: One guy who was super fanboy said, "Damn it you guys, if you don't change it back to the real sub, I'm

405
00:26:06,591 --> 00:26:06,894
Speaker 0: leaving.".

406
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,979
Speaker 0: And I note that he didn't leave.

407
00:26:10,171 --> 00:26:10,256
Speaker 1: Yep.

408
00:26:11,563 --> 00:26:12,216
Speaker 1: Yep, yep, yep.

409
00:26:12,761 --> 00:26:14,620
Speaker 0: But seriously, that shared experience.

410
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:21,039
Speaker 0: And then I remember after it ended and eventually someone turned the lights on and everyone kind of shuffled out of the room in a daze.

411
00:26:21,541 --> 00:26:25,819
Speaker 0: And almost the entire group was walking together back across the quarter mile to the dorms.

412
00:26:26,363 --> 00:26:28,040
Speaker 0: And eventually the conversation started.

413
00:26:28,641 --> 00:26:32,239
Speaker 0: And we talked about Cowboy Bebop for quite some time.

414
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:33,539
Speaker 1: Hard nod to.

415
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:49,120
Speaker 1: I mean, if you do something with some people for like, you know, a day or two and you don't do anything else in those two days and you're doing it with the same people the whole time, you kind of don't have much to do after that other than talk about what you just did.

416
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,680
Speaker 0: Plus, now that I think about it more, your focus in the world kind of narrow.

417
00:26:53,800 --> 00:27:00,998
Speaker 0: I mean, now when you're watching a movie and when you first sit down in the theater, like you still see the seats in front of you and the walls of the theater and the lights and your hands.

418
00:27:01,388 --> 00:27:01,560
Speaker 0: Yep.

419
00:27:01,782 --> 00:27:04,320
Speaker 0: And if the movie's bad, you still see those things.

420
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:09,195
Speaker 0: But if the movie draws you in, you forget that you're in a theater and you just see what's going on.

421
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:09,760
Speaker 1: Yep.

422
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:25,220
Speaker 0: But when you watch a marathon, when you marathon something that long in one contiguous stretch with a bunch of people, it's almost like your worldview narrows to where you only exist in that room watching that show and you start to forget about all your other concerns.

423
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, you absolutely begin to.

424
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,820
Speaker 1: You pretty much guaranteed you forget about your homeworks, your job, your family, everything.

425
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,500
Speaker 1: Anything outside of that room is completely lost.

426
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:40,160
Speaker 1: And even the stuff that's in the room and outside of the show get completely lost.

427
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,320
Speaker 1: I mean, very surreal and awesome.

428
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,040
Speaker 0: When we were on Ava the first time, we forgot to eat for a while.

429
00:27:46,423 --> 00:27:48,239
Speaker 0: And then we were like, oh, crap, we got to eat.

430
00:27:48,782 --> 00:27:51,319
Speaker 0: And it took it took a while for us to realize that fact.

431
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,043
Speaker 1: Yep.

432
00:27:53,085 --> 00:27:53,518
Speaker 1: Good times.

433
00:27:53,902 --> 00:27:56,620
Speaker 0: And I remember very specifically the Escaflowne marathon.

434
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:02,597
Speaker 0: It finished and it was like Sunday evening and we all go to get dinner and I go back to my dorm room.

435
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,180
Speaker 0: You know, still like really thinking about that show because I fucking love that show.

436
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:09,798
Speaker 0: And then I sit down in my computer desk and I'm like, ah.

437
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:21,940
Speaker 0: And then I remembered suddenly that I had this life where I was a student going to college and I had homework and I had classes the next day and it kind of weren't being transported to another world.

438
00:28:22,081 --> 00:28:25,840
Speaker 1: It was like a fantasy and dragons and guys with wings and robots.

439
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:29,780
Speaker 0: It sounds silly, but I suddenly remembered that and cat girls.

440
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,699
Speaker 0: I have a real life and now I have to go back to it.

441
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:34,599
Speaker 0: And I was kind of surprised by that.

442
00:28:35,082 --> 00:28:38,179
Speaker 0: And I totally skipped class Monday because I didn't have any of my homework done.

443
00:28:38,741 --> 00:28:40,399
Speaker 1: Well, it's totally, you know, escapism.

444
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:47,252
Speaker 1: You escape from the real world into this the world of whatever show you're watching for, you know, 12 hours, 24 hours, however long.

445
00:28:48,661 --> 00:28:51,860
Speaker 1: And sometimes you just really need that in your life.

446
00:28:52,541 --> 00:28:59,476
Speaker 0: You get so into it that you can care so much about the people on the screen, so much more so than you would if you watched it spread out over 26 weeks.

447
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:00,780
Speaker 1: Yep.

448
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:06,464
Speaker 0: In general, though, I'd say you really can't marathon anything that's longer than about 39, 40 episodes.

449
00:29:07,701 --> 00:29:09,160
Speaker 1: No, it just takes too damn long.

450
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,560
Speaker 0: Even Utena, we didn't marathon.

451
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,819
Speaker 0: We watched it in spurts.

452
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:12,400
Speaker 0: Like we marathon.

453
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:12,621
Speaker 0: I

454
00:29:12,661 --> 00:29:30,558
Speaker 1: guess the way you could do that is if you were some punk kids in high school or younger and you had summer vacation and you didn't have like summer camp or anything and you just sat around your house every day doing nothing, you could get all your high school friends together and you can marathon something big like, you know, a Gundam, which is 50 something episodes long or something like that.

455
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:34,979
Speaker 1: But other than that, more than 50 episodes, you really can't do it.

456
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,199
Speaker 1: It just doesn't happen.

457
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:46,119
Speaker 0: I mean, off the hand, any shows that you should marathon if you haven't seen them already, just, you know, if you want to get in on this whole experience, because if you pick a bad show to marathon, you're not going to enjoy it.

458
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,259
Speaker 1: No, very bad.

459
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,839
Speaker 0: Like Crest of the Stars, I love it, but it's a little slow.

460
00:29:51,501 --> 00:29:54,860
Speaker 0: Or Gasaraki, you don't want to marathon the first half of that.

461
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:04,478
Speaker 1: I think a good show to start marathoning, like to begin your marathon practice is Big O because Big O season one is 13 episodes and then Big O season two is 13 episodes.

462
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,960
Speaker 1: You can sort of break it into two days.

463
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,620
Speaker 0: Except, except for the fact that Big O one ends on one of the bigger cliffhangers in anime.

464
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,442
Speaker 1: I know, but you can also watch it as a single 26.

465
00:30:15,442 --> 00:30:21,479
Speaker 1: So it's, and it is sequential, there's not a lot of recap, everything moves quickly, the dub is awesome.

466
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:29,178
Speaker 0: I would say that watching Big O in marathon form is better than watching it individually, straight up.

467
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,659
Speaker 0: And you won't realize why until you start watching Big O too.

468
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:33,275
Speaker 1: Yep.

469
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:46,240
Speaker 0: Basically, you watch, we did a final thoughts episode on Big O too, so go listen to that if you want to find out more, but basically Big O, the first 13 episodes are this interesting but a little bit episodic, silly, not too serious, but kind of serious.

470
00:30:46,561 --> 00:30:47,117
Speaker 0: It's a romp.

471
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:47,959
Speaker 0: It's fun.

472
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,080
Speaker 0: It's a robot punching other robots in the face.

473
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,639
Speaker 0: And let me tell you, that's probably the best punch in anime ever.

474
00:30:54,283 --> 00:30:54,659
Speaker 0: Possibly.

475
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,952
Speaker 0: When the elbow thing goes, yup.

476
00:30:57,541 --> 00:30:58,839
Speaker 0: And then you watch Big O too.

477
00:30:59,502 --> 00:31:01,980
Speaker 0: And the whole show is completely different at that point.

478
00:31:02,381 --> 00:31:06,260
Speaker 0: And you go, if you think about Big O one, you realize a lot of interesting things.

479
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,799
Speaker 1: It switches from mad Batman to sad Batman.

480
00:31:11,086 --> 00:31:12,437
Speaker 0: I don't think we ever explained that.

481
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:14,858
Speaker 1: We're not going to.

482
00:31:15,121 --> 00:31:15,635
Speaker 0: No, of course not.

483
00:31:16,481 --> 00:31:17,300
Speaker 0: Sad Batman.

484
00:31:18,381 --> 00:31:19,139
Speaker 1: Mad Batman.

485
00:31:19,701 --> 00:31:20,440
Speaker 0: Bad Batman.

486
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,038
Speaker 1: Glad Batman.

487
00:31:22,864 --> 00:31:23,560
Speaker 0: That didn't happen.

488
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:24,360
Speaker 1: No it didn't.

489
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,637
Speaker 0: There was no Glad Batman in that entire, no there was.

490
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,740
Speaker 0: Free bat incident, Bruce Wayne, when he was a kid was Glad Batman.

491
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:31,092
Speaker 0: Yep.

492
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,400
Speaker 0: That's the only Glad Batman.

493
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:32,915
Speaker 0: Yep.

494
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:33,676
Speaker 0: All right.

495
00:31:33,982 --> 00:31:35,520
Speaker 0: I think this episode is dying.

496
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,000
Speaker 0: Al Hazzard, the original OAV, is a great marathon.

497
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,020
Speaker 0: Oh, that's awesome.

498
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,240
Speaker 0: It's compact, it's funny, but it's also a beautiful love story.

499
00:31:43,961 --> 00:31:49,760
Speaker 0: And the story, this doesn't ruin anything, but it's a very perfectly executed story that comes full circle.

500
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,639
Speaker 0: And if you watch it all in one go, it'll have a lot more impact.

501
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:53,325
Speaker 0: Yeah.

502
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,779
Speaker 0: Especially because then you can watch the first episode again.

503
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,320
Speaker 0: Like literally, watch Al Hazzard, then watch the first episode again, and then stop there.

504
00:32:03,202 --> 00:32:03,244
Speaker 0: Ah.

505
00:32:04,106 --> 00:32:04,398
Speaker 0: Yes.

506
00:32:05,706 --> 00:32:08,760
Speaker 0: Of course, Escaflowne, Ava, Cowboy Bebop.

507
00:32:09,401 --> 00:32:12,918
Speaker 1: Any show that's awesome, you know, separate, will be also awesome.

508
00:32:12,938 --> 00:32:13,300
Speaker 1: marathon.

509
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,820
Speaker 0: Hellsing ain't so bad, actually.

510
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, Hellsing's a good choice.

511
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,480
Speaker 0: 'Cause if you don't keep watching it, you'll lose interest.

512
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:19,398
Speaker 1: Yep.

513
00:32:20,141 --> 00:32:21,934
Speaker 1: I'm trying to think of more, but, uh, oh.

514
00:32:23,001 --> 00:32:24,459
Speaker 0: I'd say Utena, but no.

515
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,169
Speaker 0: The real answer is marathon.

516
00:32:26,209 --> 00:32:27,780
Speaker 0: the last 13 episodes of Utena.

517
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,165
Speaker 1: The first season of Initial D.

518
00:32:29,687 --> 00:32:35,059
Speaker 0: Yeah, the first season of Initial D. Because basically, once you get drawn into that show, you're either gonna love it or hate it.

519
00:32:35,881 --> 00:32:39,240
Speaker 1: A lot of the shorter Gundams, like some of the Gundam OAVs, those are good.

520
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,660
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, don't watch War in the Pocket episode at this time.

521
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,620
Speaker 0: Just watch it like a movie.

522
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,050
Speaker 1: Yep.

523
00:32:43,845 --> 00:32:44,040
Speaker 1: Alright.

524
00:32:44,482 --> 00:32:44,999
Speaker 1: I think we're done.

525
00:32:45,341 --> 00:32:45,919
Speaker 0: I think we're done.

526
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,600
Speaker 0: Uh, stay tuned tomorrow.

527
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:56,140
Speaker 0: We'll get back to our regularly scheduled Geek Nights, and, uh, look forward to seeing us at Kineticon, Otacon, the New York Anime Festival, and Katsucon.

528
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,199
Speaker 1: We're not going to Anime Next this weekend.

529
00:32:58,401 --> 00:32:59,419
Speaker 1: We thought we were, but we're not.

530
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,280
Speaker 0: Yes, we'll talk about that next Wednesday.

531
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:01,627
Speaker 0: Yep.

532
00:33:02,321 --> 00:33:03,140
Speaker 1: After Anime Next.

533
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,279
Speaker 0: Yes, of course!
