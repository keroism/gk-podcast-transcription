Speaker 0: 2011. yeah, the Daily Show says 2011.

11
00:00:37,863 --> 00:00:38,163
Speaker 1: They're wrong.

12
00:00:38,184 --> 00:00:38,585
Speaker 1: They're right.

13
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,069
Speaker 1: you said if it was the year 1911 would you say?

14
00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:45,443
Speaker 0: 1911 or would you say 1911 depends?

15
00:00:45,463 --> 00:00:46,085
Speaker 0: What do you mean depends?

16
00:00:46,105 --> 00:00:46,446
Speaker 0: sometimes I say?

17
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:50,840
Speaker 0: 1948.

18
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,983
Speaker 1: you said 1991 1992 19 all through your whole life.

19
00:00:52,003 --> 00:00:52,866
Speaker 0: It was 19 and that number.

20
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:58,604
Speaker 0: so now it is 20.

21
00:00:58,604 --> 00:00:59,455
Speaker 0: And then the number.

22
00:00:59,557 --> 00:01:02,231
Speaker 1: yeah 22,000. they're pretty much the same.

23
00:01:02,352 --> 00:01:08,354
Speaker 0: only in the first decade 2001 2002 as soon as you get that was one D.

24
00:01:08,374 --> 00:01:09,158
Speaker 1: That was the arts.

25
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:11,687
Speaker 1: no 2010 that was 20 on one.

26
00:01:11,848 --> 00:01:17,467
Speaker 0: you could do that to 20 on to jerk, but it as soon as you get to 2010 It's funny said that I can't use.

27
00:01:17,487 --> 00:01:21,020
Speaker 1: I will probably never live to see the day where I can use on a guarantee.

28
00:01:21,242 --> 00:01:22,733
Speaker 0: You will never live to use odd again.

29
00:01:22,773 --> 00:01:27,880
Speaker 0: if you use odd again I will give you all my money except possibly referring to the past.

30
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:37,408
Speaker 0: I will give if you use it hit it to refer to the present year correctly ever again in your entire life And I am alive and you are alive.

31
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:38,493
Speaker 0: I'll give you every money.

32
00:01:38,594 --> 00:01:41,340
Speaker 1: I own so anyway There's not a lot of you know weird.

33
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,418
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday anime manga comics all that stuff and yet there usually isn't that much news lately.

34
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,408
Speaker 1: that well We at least care about.

35
00:01:49,529 --> 00:01:51,419
Speaker 0: well actually there is a comic news.

36
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,511
Speaker 0: You want to hear this comic news?

37
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:54,440
Speaker 1: I'll hear this comic news.

38
00:01:54,621 --> 00:01:56,150
Speaker 0: I also have a geek bite, but I want to do both.

39
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:56,673
Speaker 0: is that okay?

40
00:01:56,834 --> 00:01:57,458
Speaker 0: You can do both.

41
00:01:57,579 --> 00:01:58,764
Speaker 0: alright It's a comic news.

42
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,145
Speaker 0: you ready.

43
00:01:59,265 --> 00:01:59,687
Speaker 0: I'm ready.

44
00:01:59,767 --> 00:02:00,510
Speaker 0: You probably no one.

45
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,557
Speaker 0: This is weird because it's sort of like this thing.

46
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:07,355
Speaker 0: well That that was true for a long time, but wasn't completely true.

47
00:02:07,797 --> 00:02:09,463
Speaker 0: and basically now It's completely true.

48
00:02:09,523 --> 00:02:10,485
Speaker 0: so Superman's dead.

49
00:02:10,727 --> 00:02:14,860
Speaker 0: no wizard magazine is no more wizard magazine.

50
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,104
Speaker 0: It is existed.

51
00:02:16,205 --> 00:02:17,268
Speaker 0: it is ceased to be.

52
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:19,175
Speaker 1: no really wizard still exists.

53
00:02:19,276 --> 00:02:20,540
Speaker 0: also toy fair magazine.

54
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,707
Speaker 0: How about scribe?

55
00:02:21,788 --> 00:02:22,854
Speaker 1: is scribe still going?

56
00:02:22,874 --> 00:02:25,545
Speaker 0: that's dead a long time Yeah, but basically right.

57
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:37,164
Speaker 0: the wizard whole thing was going downhill for a long time and people you know used to love it in The 90s but now more recently they were hating it and they were like oh wizard and wizards been doing a lot of bad shit With their conventions to real bad.

58
00:02:37,185 --> 00:02:37,866
Speaker 0: right.

59
00:02:37,906 --> 00:02:39,751
Speaker 1: but remember Philly wizard world.

60
00:02:39,972 --> 00:02:42,880
Speaker 0: yeah, that was that was right before they got real bad.

61
00:02:43,161 --> 00:02:48,883
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was honestly one of the most boring and depressing conventions I have ever seen.

62
00:02:49,064 --> 00:02:52,820
Speaker 0: but anyway, you know so the whole wizard thing they're pretty much gone.

63
00:02:53,061 --> 00:02:58,660
Speaker 0: They've hit rock bottom now, and it's it's game over, but you know it's like back in the day like wizard.

64
00:02:58,861 --> 00:02:59,322
Speaker 0: You know it's.

65
00:02:59,382 --> 00:03:00,466
Speaker 0: it's one of those things where it's like.

66
00:03:00,486 --> 00:03:03,135
Speaker 0: it was such a gradual decline.

67
00:03:03,656 --> 00:03:04,720
Speaker 0: You know it's not like newspapers.

68
00:03:05,002 --> 00:03:06,551
Speaker 0: It's gonna be the same situation right.

69
00:03:06,571 --> 00:03:15,680
Speaker 0: such a gradual decline That the day they die is gonna be so unmomentous because they basically been shindeiru for many many years.

70
00:03:15,741 --> 00:03:16,467
Speaker 0: It's like you know.

71
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:17,213
Speaker 0: you know.

72
00:03:17,314 --> 00:03:17,616
Speaker 0: it's like.

73
00:03:18,422 --> 00:03:22,740
Speaker 0: It's like when five years ago Kentro went what that that that hit wizard in the in the neck.

74
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,749
Speaker 0: But today they just exploded.

75
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,000
Speaker 0: so it's like we knew that finally go out of business.

76
00:03:27,483 --> 00:03:28,147
Speaker 1: We won't like who would.

77
00:03:28,227 --> 00:03:30,300
Speaker 1: how would I even know if AOL went out of business?

78
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,532
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like it by the time that they go out of business.

79
00:03:33,552 --> 00:03:35,240
Speaker 0: They're gonna be so tiny already.

80
00:03:35,402 --> 00:03:37,341
Speaker 0: It's like you know they shrink so much I don't know.

81
00:03:37,582 --> 00:03:46,351
Speaker 1: well that actually dovetails quite nicely into my news because while you know wizard that whole aspect of comic-dom was Basically on the decline forever.

82
00:03:46,371 --> 00:03:52,900
Speaker 1: not forever, but for all of modern history Reed and the New York Comic Con and all those things have actually been on the upswing.

83
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,513
Speaker 1: Reed is kind of taking the New York Comic Con and the shell of what remains of the New York Anime Festival and turn them into An SDCC competitor.

84
00:04:01,634 --> 00:04:03,865
Speaker 0: well they're pretty much That's always what they wanted and now they're.

85
00:04:03,925 --> 00:04:08,340
Speaker 0: they're going even farther to pretty much copy the San Diego Comic Con in every conceivable way.

86
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,907
Speaker 1: And that is the news.

87
00:04:09,947 --> 00:04:14,407
Speaker 1: the New York Comic Con is officially now not one not two not three But four days.

88
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:16,740
Speaker 0: well the fourth day is really a preview night.

89
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,744
Speaker 0: It's not a full day.

90
00:04:17,803 --> 00:04:23,489
Speaker 0: where else have we seen a fourth day preview night, San Diego, Comicon And they even call it preview night.

91
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:24,936
Speaker 0: They're calling it the exact same thing.

92
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,347
Speaker 1: yeah I'm not very conflicted about this.

93
00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:31,480
Speaker 1: I do not fault Reed for making this decision.

94
00:04:31,681 --> 00:04:35,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you're a pro for-profit con you did it's gonna make you money.

95
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,363
Speaker 0: How could you not do it?

96
00:04:36,664 --> 00:04:38,129
Speaker 0: it, but I but it does.

97
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:44,609
Speaker 1: it service the fans now well well well well It does in a way, but does it service the industry?

98
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:48,400
Speaker 1: it doesn't service the same fans because there's different kind.

99
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,880
Speaker 1: There's like three kinds of conventions that at least Scott and I care about these days.

100
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,903
Speaker 1: They're the only ones we go to.

101
00:04:53,465 --> 00:04:58,200
Speaker 1: there's either the real deal professional convention run by people who know what they're doing.

102
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,453
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the New York Comic Con, New York Anime Festival.

103
00:05:00,473 --> 00:05:01,540
Speaker 1: You know all the Reed cons.

104
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:07,659
Speaker 1: There's the fan run con that has a lot of spirit, but is run by incompetent morons.

105
00:05:08,903 --> 00:05:14,620
Speaker 1: Maybe I shouldn't name names those cons You know like the Otakons and as much as I love Kineticon we're staff.

106
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:21,478
Speaker 1: We were directors of programming and stuff and even we have trouble there, and and then there's Pax Which just does everything perfectly?

107
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:28,719
Speaker 1: yeah, I says like all the benefits of the fan con and all the benefits of the pro con with pretty much no drawbacks.

108
00:05:28,739 --> 00:05:33,140
Speaker 1: and Nope, what bothers me is that the New York Comic Con and Reed?

109
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,711
Speaker 1: They're doing everything right.

110
00:05:34,972 --> 00:05:39,600
Speaker 1: if they came to me and said rim How can we make more money with this con and make it more popular?

111
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,486
Speaker 1: I would say do everything that you just did.

112
00:05:41,988 --> 00:05:45,620
Speaker 1: yeah, but it makes the con way less fun for people like us.

113
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:55,169
Speaker 1: It's fun for the Hollywood types the people who go to see a famous person or to see the guy who's playing the superhero in The superhero movie based on the comic they didn't read.

114
00:05:55,189 --> 00:06:02,920
Speaker 0: it's also fun for people who are like you know They want to dig around in bins of comics for a long time and see like absolutely amazing.

115
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:05,832
Speaker 0: You know that kind of stuff, but you know there are other places to do that.

116
00:06:05,852 --> 00:06:07,620
Speaker 0: It doesn't it's not exclusive in that regard.

117
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:13,120
Speaker 1: It's also fun for the I don't want to say casual fan because that is such a misnomer And it has too much connotation.

118
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:19,872
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you were like a slight fan of nerdy stuff, and you went to this it would just blow your mind like oh Like.

119
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:20,740
Speaker 1: I have a lot of co-workers.

120
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:28,294
Speaker 1: They're not into comics or into anime or into gaming But they do and consume all of those things and they don't think anything of it.

121
00:06:28,575 --> 00:06:34,680
Speaker 1: so they hear oh, there's a comic-con I'll go for a day, and it's big and flashy and there's crazy stuff everywhere, and they have an awesome time.

122
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:42,760
Speaker 1: It's basically only not fun for what I would almost call the advanced fan who is not single minded and single focused.

123
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:49,019
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean if you're an advanced the thing is there are advanced fans who have you know some sort of?

124
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:49,280
Speaker 0: you know?

125
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,325
Speaker 0: They like to spend money.

126
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:54,206
Speaker 0: right because it's your comic con Yeah, the whole convention.

127
00:06:54,347 --> 00:07:02,260
Speaker 0: if you gear the convention towards making money Then what you're gonna Do is you're gonna make it most appealing to the fan who likes to spend money?

128
00:07:02,661 --> 00:07:09,705
Speaker 0: So the kind of fan who's not a big spender someone who's not interested in shopping or paying for art from artists You know.

129
00:07:09,725 --> 00:07:16,671
Speaker 0: or and pretty much you know Buying DVDs and paying to see get autographs and all that you know.

130
00:07:16,932 --> 00:07:22,566
Speaker 0: someone who's not going to pay money someone who's there to Participate in sort of community things right.

131
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:25,193
Speaker 0: look at the conventions like PAX and even Otacon.

132
00:07:25,213 --> 00:07:26,717
Speaker 0: how many community meetups.

133
00:07:26,817 --> 00:07:27,880
Speaker 0: and go in the forums.

134
00:07:28,961 --> 00:07:30,566
Speaker 0: Let's get together and play Pokemon.

135
00:07:30,627 --> 00:07:33,216
Speaker 1: There's the surface level flash kind of show me stuff.

136
00:07:33,658 --> 00:07:46,388
Speaker 1: There's the Programming like actual discrete programming not just like the big floor, but like go to this panel go to this event Yeah, and then there's the hang out with like-minded people and we know we've said this a lot And we have a lot of like-minded people.

137
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:48,500
Speaker 0: doesn't make the convention more money so that is minimized.

138
00:07:48,641 --> 00:07:55,385
Speaker 1: Well, we have a lot of evidence at least anecdotal evidence from the last decade of going to conventions that by and large Comic-con attendees.

139
00:07:55,526 --> 00:07:58,815
Speaker 1: any comic-con are not there nearly as much for the community.

140
00:07:59,036 --> 00:08:03,570
Speaker 1: well actually heard to anime fans who are only there for the community.

141
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:11,880
Speaker 0: well one thing I have noticed right is that the Many of the people who are there for the community right are the people behind the tables right?

142
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:25,280
Speaker 0: It's like if you're some guy who's like a podcaster will be there behind the table And he's friends all these artists who are behind tables and they're friends with vendors who are behind tables And they're friends with other people who are behind in the expo hall right and there's a community there.

143
00:08:25,701 --> 00:08:31,177
Speaker 0: And there's also a community between people who are you know sort of into the same thing right.

144
00:08:31,217 --> 00:08:40,659
Speaker 0: so a whole bunch of people might be in line for an artist and they're all fans of the same thing and this community in that respect or Maybe a whole bunch of people are fans of the same.

145
00:08:41,592 --> 00:08:45,197
Speaker 0: You know Publisher or something so they'll be all around that.

146
00:08:45,238 --> 00:08:52,968
Speaker 0: publishers You know dealer area yep, or they'll be the guys who are in a community of Trading comics that are sealed in plastic.

147
00:08:52,988 --> 00:08:56,280
Speaker 0: so at the table where they seal stuff in plastic those guys are all together right?

148
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:08,940
Speaker 1: But there isn't community like you know Triwizard drinking tournament community yep Or it was most stark last year the New York comic-con New York anime festival win if you walked around any part of the con.

149
00:09:09,321 --> 00:09:20,920
Speaker 1: But the anime ghetto it was basically a giant crowd of people shuffling and looking walking around looking around walking around looking around Standing in a lot of money, and if you went to the anime ghetto it was just as crowded.

150
00:09:21,304 --> 00:09:31,329
Speaker 1: But it was people like in big Clobs just talking to each other and hanging out and dicking around and running around and hitting each other and just like sitting in Circles good and bad good and bad.

151
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,585
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna say that it's all good, but then again I'm an old man who's too old for that shit.

152
00:09:35,766 --> 00:09:37,110
Speaker 1: That's right, but it's very.

153
00:09:37,572 --> 00:09:50,880
Speaker 1: They're so diametrically opposed and while our Programming like the stuff didn't eyes what we do like our real lectures Really fit more on the professional comic-con side like you do the professional panel.

154
00:09:52,062 --> 00:10:03,176
Speaker 0: it's more fun to hang out in the anime side and Consequently and even though the even though the presentation of our panel is professional the content is more geared towards Than you know not the comic people.

155
00:10:03,499 --> 00:10:16,980
Speaker 1: yeah well it was very telling that the because the comic and the anime panels last year were kind of separated and Every time I walked over to the comic area unless it was Famous guy talking about his thing there was literally like two people in every room.

156
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:21,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, they were like panels over there were either crazy full or crazy empty.

157
00:10:21,482 --> 00:10:25,926
Speaker 1: I mean most of the anime panels at least the ones I saw were actually really Crowded like all of them.

158
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:28,480
Speaker 1: just there was a solid group of people that were just going to every panel.

159
00:10:28,701 --> 00:10:38,591
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the end result of this is that I don't know where the New York comic-con is going other than that It's becoming SDCC in NYC.

160
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:39,535
Speaker 0: That's what it is.

161
00:10:39,755 --> 00:10:42,734
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's pretty much it and We'll see what happens.

162
00:10:42,795 --> 00:10:52,205
Speaker 1: last year We were gonna really up our content, and then we we ended up only doing one panel in the anime side Which was fun, but it made me realize this weird aside It's kind of a geek nights meta thing.

163
00:10:52,727 --> 00:10:55,759
Speaker 1: we haven't been to many anime cons in the last year.

164
00:10:56,241 --> 00:11:04,600
Speaker 1: No, I mean we ditched on Otacon because they didn't like they didn't have anything for us and We didn't go to a lot of smaller anime cons that invited us out.

165
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,133
Speaker 1: I think Zenkai Con is the next anime con we're going to since anime Boston.

166
00:11:08,274 --> 00:11:09,499
Speaker 0: Anime Boston Zenkai Con.

167
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,589
Speaker 0: we're down And Kineticon is has anime content.

168
00:11:12,609 --> 00:11:16,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, Kineticon has anime, but it's an everything con anyway.

169
00:11:16,503 --> 00:11:17,779
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna do a geek bite here.

170
00:11:18,141 --> 00:11:23,280
Speaker 0: Alright, so this normally it's a video game, but this is not a video game for video game people.

171
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,666
Speaker 0: It's basically for anime manga.

172
00:11:26,027 --> 00:11:27,792
Speaker 1: It's not for you alright.

173
00:11:27,872 --> 00:11:30,720
Speaker 0: The game is it's a DS game, and I'm sure you might have heard of it.

174
00:11:30,861 --> 00:11:31,332
Speaker 0: It's called.

175
00:11:32,902 --> 00:11:34,386
Speaker 0: Well it's nine person.

176
00:11:34,446 --> 00:11:36,171
Speaker 0: I'm not sure which nine persons.

177
00:11:36,251 --> 00:11:36,994
Speaker 0: nine don't know.

178
00:11:37,074 --> 00:11:39,120
Speaker 0: nine hours nine persons nine doors.

179
00:11:39,321 --> 00:11:43,737
Speaker 0: I forget which order it's like hours persons doors or persons doors hours, but anyway.

180
00:11:43,777 --> 00:11:44,620
Speaker 0: It's nine nine nine.

181
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,089
Speaker 1: What's the equation is like door hours per person?

182
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:50,260
Speaker 0: It's nine nine nine nine hours nine persons nine doors.

183
00:11:50,401 --> 00:12:07,086
Speaker 0: That's the game and this is It's an adventure game right on the DS when it's very very focused on story And it's pretty much got you know anime characters, which are pretty well designed and a very good Naoki Urasawa.

184
00:12:07,206 --> 00:12:10,219
Speaker 0: ish kind of story right or it's one of those.

185
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:10,560
Speaker 0: you know.

186
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,993
Speaker 0: It's in the genre of sort of Death Note where there's a crazy scenario.

187
00:12:14,154 --> 00:12:18,472
Speaker 0: it basically the crazy scenario is You're some guy Junpei.

188
00:12:18,874 --> 00:12:20,864
Speaker 0: you got you know Ether.

189
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:29,420
Speaker 0: oh no you wake up in a room on a boat And there's a number five on the door And you've got a wristband with the number five on it also sort of a battle royale kind of situation.

190
00:12:29,601 --> 00:12:38,032
Speaker 0: you know same kind of thing also, and then you realize there's a whole bunch of people on this boat with wristbands with numbers and You can only give you there's a number.

191
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:41,228
Speaker 0: you have to get out and In order to get out you to go through.

192
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:51,636
Speaker 0: you know these numbered doors and solve puzzles and then there's a lot of plot and you got it's a choose your own adventure book where Occasionally you have to stop and solve a bunch of puzzles, and then you know more.

193
00:12:51,676 --> 00:12:52,800
Speaker 0: choose your own adventure occurs.

194
00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:00,400
Speaker 0: Now I don't want to talk about the game too much except to say this one thing The number one problem in the game is slow text speed.

195
00:13:00,641 --> 00:13:05,780
Speaker 0: But there are multiple endings and if you play through again any text you've already seen you can fast forward.

196
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:15,749
Speaker 0: Ah, however when you play through again If you do the same puzzle again if you choose say the same path And there's a puzzle you've already solved you do the puzzle again You can do it again really fast because it's the same puzzle.

197
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,216
Speaker 0: I would hope but you had to do it again.

198
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:20,359
Speaker 0: anyway Here's the thing about this game.

199
00:13:20,942 --> 00:13:25,540
Speaker 0: I said alright for my first playthrough cuz Conrad sort of you know told me what was up with it before.

200
00:13:25,701 --> 00:13:26,605
Speaker 0: You know he was like.

201
00:13:26,726 --> 00:13:29,520
Speaker 0: I do not know what is up, but he didn't tell me all that was up.

202
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,525
Speaker 0: He just told me that it was.

203
00:13:30,545 --> 00:13:33,098
Speaker 0: sort of you know it was annoying with all these different endings like he's like.

204
00:13:33,198 --> 00:13:43,197
Speaker 0: all the first Time I played I got that shit ending and then the second time I played I got the to be continued ending and I was like Oh great So I played it and I said I'm just gonna do whatever I feel is right and see what ending I get.

205
00:13:43,358 --> 00:13:44,686
Speaker 1: that's the best Way to play a game like.

206
00:13:44,706 --> 00:13:45,693
Speaker 0: so I got at the.

207
00:13:45,774 --> 00:13:46,580
Speaker 0: I beat it yesterday.

208
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,222
Speaker 1: That's how I played.

209
00:13:47,322 --> 00:13:54,551
Speaker 0: one chance I beat it yesterday, and I got quote-unquote the coffin ending right, so I said all right I got the coffin ending.

210
00:13:54,591 --> 00:13:55,560
Speaker 0: it said to be continued.

211
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,591
Speaker 0: I was like aha I didn't die on the first ending.

212
00:13:57,611 --> 00:13:59,059
Speaker 0: that's better than the coffee.

213
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:00,030
Speaker 0: here I got the hit.

214
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:00,880
Speaker 0: I did better than Conrad.

215
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,810
Speaker 0: So then I'm like all right time to go to game facts.

216
00:14:03,931 --> 00:14:06,682
Speaker 0: so into game facts and look at a list of endings you ready For some bullshit.

217
00:14:06,702 --> 00:14:09,751
Speaker 0: Uh-huh here's the bullshit the coffin ending.

218
00:14:09,771 --> 00:14:11,677
Speaker 0: I guess this is a minor spoiler.

219
00:14:11,737 --> 00:14:15,645
Speaker 0: the coffin ending is The true ending.

220
00:14:16,006 --> 00:14:19,478
Speaker 0: in order to get the quote true ending you have to do the exact same thing.

221
00:14:19,518 --> 00:14:20,823
Speaker 0: you have to do to get The coffin ending.

222
00:14:21,144 --> 00:14:24,940
Speaker 0: however, it's simply that you can't get the true ending on your first playthrough.

223
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,683
Speaker 0: There is no way.

224
00:14:26,045 --> 00:14:32,028
Speaker 0: so in order for me to get the true ending at a place of play the exact same game again Making the exact same decision no no no no you don't.

225
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:35,199
Speaker 1: what you have to do is type true ending into YouTube.

226
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,792
Speaker 0: hello That's what I did last night.

227
00:14:36,934 --> 00:14:38,807
Speaker 0: all right But get this.

228
00:14:38,827 --> 00:14:39,611
Speaker 0: so you're ready for this.

229
00:14:39,852 --> 00:14:42,003
Speaker 0: so I typed true ending into YouTube And there was a guy.

230
00:14:42,023 --> 00:14:49,589
Speaker 0: he made like a at least 40 or 50 part video of the whole game Including the true ending right every single second of the game.

231
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:57,759
Speaker 0: wow so I was just watching from the part where the coffin is forward at through that you know past the to be continued to through the true ending.

232
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:02,514
Speaker 0: and If you're doing the true ending basically there's a whole fuck ton of game beyond that point.

233
00:15:02,876 --> 00:15:04,000
Speaker 0: like there are multiple puzzles.

234
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,160
Speaker 1: Wait so it's a Castlevania situation.

235
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:11,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, but pretty much the only way to get to the upside-down castle is to beat the game twice the exact same way.

236
00:15:13,343 --> 00:15:14,749
Speaker 1: I guess I'll have to deal with that.

237
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,120
Speaker 0: and no I just kept watching on YouTube.

238
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:18,547
Speaker 0: I wrote down.

239
00:15:18,788 --> 00:15:20,577
Speaker 0: I couldn't even finish it cuz it was so long.

240
00:15:20,617 --> 00:15:21,100
Speaker 0: I wrote down.

241
00:15:21,422 --> 00:15:31,482
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go home, and I'm gonna pick up at part 42 And keep going until I see the end because there is no way I'm gonna play the exact same game again even with fast-forwarding The text.

242
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,500
Speaker 1: what's funny is based on a vague reading of what the plot is.

243
00:15:34,721 --> 00:15:40,172
Speaker 0: Pretty good death note battle royale and Arasawa kind of suspense.

244
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:47,419
Speaker 1: there's a movie I watched recently just randomly because it was on Netflix while I was like cleaning up the apartment called exam.

245
00:15:48,422 --> 00:15:54,518
Speaker 1: It's from 2009. eight dudes locked in a room to take an exam, and that's the whole movie.

246
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:55,905
Speaker 0: Yeah It's a similar.

247
00:15:56,005 --> 00:16:03,699
Speaker 0: It's one of those weird scenario Sci-fi thriller mystery situations that you know it always seems to work out really well.

248
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,661
Speaker 0: I mean They were 11.

249
00:16:06,661 --> 00:16:10,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually they were 11 and exam kind of similar.

250
00:16:10,661 --> 00:16:11,585
Speaker 0: It's a. it's a whole.

251
00:16:11,665 --> 00:16:14,156
Speaker 0: it's a genre that I'm getting sort of keen on.

252
00:16:14,176 --> 00:16:15,080
Speaker 0: you know I mean death note.

253
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,084
Speaker 0: I think sort of really.

254
00:16:16,485 --> 00:16:17,369
Speaker 1: I hear by dub it.

255
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:19,416
Speaker 1: I hereby dub it the 12 angry men.

256
00:16:19,457 --> 00:16:27,140
Speaker 0: genre 12 angry men is not really the same genre because it doesn't have these sci-fi mystery thriller even though it does have a scenario.

257
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:30,440
Speaker 1: Right yeah, but I think it's the closed scenario limited number of people.

258
00:16:31,082 --> 00:16:33,989
Speaker 1: They don't know what the answer is and you don't know what the answer is.

259
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,115
Speaker 1: whatever no whatever there is to answer.

260
00:16:36,135 --> 00:16:40,309
Speaker 1: hmm anyway Or the I mean some of these are the.

261
00:16:40,591 --> 00:16:42,240
Speaker 1: you're in one room for the entire movie.

262
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:49,463
Speaker 0: No, because what death note is not that right death note is there's you know a weird sci-fi or supernatural Scenario.

263
00:16:49,764 --> 00:16:49,865
Speaker 0: ah.

264
00:16:49,905 --> 00:16:51,836
Speaker 0: but and then the suspense and mystery.

265
00:16:51,896 --> 00:16:58,320
Speaker 1: there's the difference I think between these the scenario that set in the world versus the scenario that's completely cut off from the world.

266
00:16:58,864 --> 00:17:00,717
Speaker 1: I feel like they're two very different kinds of movies.

267
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:04,412
Speaker 0: now This is pretty much gives this game gives you the same feeling as death note.

268
00:17:04,452 --> 00:17:06,660
Speaker 0: the same feeling is like a 20th century boys.

269
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,948
Speaker 0: They're definitely in the same wheelhouse.

270
00:17:08,968 --> 00:17:09,209
Speaker 0: I don't know.

271
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:10,473
Speaker 1: maybe you should watch the exam.

272
00:17:10,492 --> 00:17:13,323
Speaker 1: well just exam wasn't great But it wasn't bad.

273
00:17:13,343 --> 00:17:15,694
Speaker 0: I got there great things to watch on the list.

274
00:17:15,895 --> 00:17:16,779
Speaker 0: so fuck the exam until.

275
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,809
Speaker 1: So things of the day, what do you got for me Scott in?

276
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:29,490

Speaker 0: oh snap.

278
00:17:31,006 --> 00:17:34,320
Speaker 0: so Everybody knows Kate Beaton is the most awesome.

279
00:17:34,501 --> 00:17:35,444
Speaker 0: that is not a secret.

280
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:40,607
Speaker 0: if it's a secret to you Then you are nobody because it's a secret to everybody.

281
00:17:40,707 --> 00:17:46,327
Speaker 1: they'd beaten Consistently makes me laugh more than most people I've ever everybody.

282
00:17:46,528 --> 00:17:47,050
Speaker 0: so anyway.

283
00:17:48,092 --> 00:17:50,159
Speaker 0: So her webcomic is hearts artist.

284
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,170
Speaker 0: hark a vagrant is the best webcomic anyway.

285
00:17:53,391 --> 00:17:57,410
Speaker 0: So you may remember in the olden days penny arcade once did a thing where?

286
00:17:58,152 --> 00:18:03,206
Speaker 0: Some guy took penny arcade strips and erased all the words and then had his students fill in the words.

287
00:18:03,547 --> 00:18:10,118
Speaker 0: as you know a learning lesson right to these blank speech bubble comics And it was hilarity Lowell.

288
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,635
Speaker 0: well it was a guy he teaches English in Korea who's a friend of Kate Beaton.

289
00:18:15,116 --> 00:18:23,132
Speaker 0: he took Kate Beaton's comics erased the words out of the speech bubbles and had the students fill him in and Hilarity.

290
00:18:23,152 --> 00:18:24,819
Speaker 0: I mean this has been done a lot of time.

291
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:25,943
Speaker 0: any arcade did it.

292
00:18:26,024 --> 00:18:30,960
Speaker 0: yeah a lot of people have done this But this is the most hilarious of all times.

293
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,909
Speaker 0: I have seen it done, so it is a thing of the day worthy.

294
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,197
Speaker 1: So Stanley fish.

295
00:18:37,438 --> 00:18:38,804
Speaker 1: you may not know who Stanley.

296
00:18:39,246 --> 00:18:41,394
Speaker 0: Stanley Spider-man.

297
00:18:41,434 --> 00:18:43,969
Speaker 0: Stanley fish fish spider-man.

298
00:18:44,652 --> 00:18:48,830
Speaker 1: He was a literary critic a legal scholar works for the New York Times all these sorts of things.

299
00:18:49,492 --> 00:18:55,110
Speaker 1: And he shares something at least with me and with I think some of our listeners the number four or not for a mites?

300
00:18:55,151 --> 00:19:05,427
Speaker 1: Yes, just one That he's very much enamored with language and diction and prose and sentences and grammar and all that sort of stuff that I find fascinating.

301
00:19:05,447 --> 00:19:09,320
Speaker 1: all right and He has a book entitled how to write a sentence.

302
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,223
Speaker 1: so what I have for you.

303
00:19:10,243 --> 00:19:11,789
Speaker 1: This is a website talking about it.

304
00:19:12,713 --> 00:19:19,943
Speaker 1: He has a list of what he describes as five of the greatest Sentences ever written in what makes a sentence great.

305
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:21,127
Speaker 0: Well that you could.

306
00:19:21,287 --> 00:19:21,990
Speaker 1: I'm gonna read the book.

307
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:22,690
Speaker 1: I already ordered it.

308
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:23,834
Speaker 1: I'm curious to see what he says.

309
00:19:23,854 --> 00:19:27,448
Speaker 0: is it the content of what the sentence is saying or is it simply the structure?

310
00:19:27,509 --> 00:19:35,576
Speaker 1: it is the structure of the sentence the the manner in which it reveals to you its nature and its truth the beauty of it the symmetry of It all those things combined.

311
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:43,890
Speaker 0: and I gotta tell you these are some pretty good sentences All right, well let me hear these sentences all right Or do I have to see them to see the punctuation to really get them?

312
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:47,984
Speaker 1: I think I can read the punctuation pretty pretty solidly.

313
00:19:48,004 --> 00:19:49,429
Speaker 0: all right, so sentence number one.

314
00:19:50,332 --> 00:19:56,229
Speaker 1: Last week I saw a woman flayed and you will hardly believe how much it altered her appearance for the worse.

315
00:19:57,871 --> 00:19:59,980
Speaker 0: Uh-huh all right this one's okay.

316
00:20:00,141 --> 00:20:04,012
Speaker 1: This is from 1678.

317
00:20:04,012 --> 00:20:10,150
Speaker 1: Now he had not run far from his own door But his wife and children perceiving it began crying after him to return.

318
00:20:10,611 --> 00:20:13,201
Speaker 1: But the man put his fingers in his ears and ran on crying.

319
00:20:13,281 --> 00:20:17,038
Speaker 1: life life eternal life That's smart man.

320
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:18,346
Speaker 1: all one sentence.

321
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:21,273
Speaker 1: yep I read one more.

322
00:20:21,675 --> 00:20:22,659
Speaker 0: I like how a lot of people.

323
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,144
Speaker 0: this you know reminds me of something.

324
00:20:24,185 --> 00:20:30,750
Speaker 0: a lot of people right there Either don't know run-on sentences, so they write them all the time, or they never write a long sentence.

325
00:20:31,092 --> 00:20:31,815
Speaker 0: They never they.

326
00:20:31,836 --> 00:20:34,530
Speaker 0: they're worried about run-on sentences, so they never write a long sentence.

327
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,474
Speaker 0: I tell you friend.

328
00:20:35,655 --> 00:20:38,870
Speaker 0: I tell you go look at the Constitution or Declaration of Independence.

329
00:20:38,951 --> 00:20:47,890
Speaker 0: We hold these truths to be self-evident that all You can write a fucking long ass sentence and still it would be legitimately one sentence.

330
00:20:48,293 --> 00:20:49,038
Speaker 0: I do it all time.

331
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:52,997
Speaker 1: also if you want to be tricky There's always the semi colonic sentence.

332
00:20:53,057 --> 00:20:54,442
Speaker 1: semi colons are your friend.

333
00:20:54,763 --> 00:20:56,890
Speaker 1: it just lets you cram sentences into a sentence.

334
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:04,490
Speaker 0: Not really you can only do it if the set if those separate sentences with it the semicolon are actually part of the same idea.

335
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,957
Speaker 1: Yes, same idea, but not directly related.

336
00:21:06,997 --> 00:21:09,464
Speaker 1: the colon is the directly related right colon.

337
00:21:09,504 --> 00:21:11,490
Speaker 1: is the this therefore this or something to that effect?

338
00:21:11,831 --> 00:21:14,761
Speaker 1: The semi colon is the basically two related sentences.

339
00:21:15,062 --> 00:21:19,499
Speaker 0: right, but you can't be like you know say yet two completely unrelated sentences.

340
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:25,168
Speaker 0: like you know see spot run and Scott likes.

341
00:21:26,431 --> 00:21:34,010
Speaker 1: Well, I can say this I cannot imagine a very nice sentence that involves a semicolon that is simultaneously imperative.

342
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:36,423
Speaker 1: I I don't think that can work.

343
00:21:36,665 --> 00:21:37,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll read one more.

344
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:46,088
Speaker 1: I think this is my favorite one and I shall go on talking in a low voice while the sea sounds in the distance and overhead the great black flood of wind polishes the bright stars.

345
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,476
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, I here's the excerpt from the book.

346
00:21:48,757 --> 00:21:57,625
Speaker 1: in this sentence the personal voice of the narrator is absorbed by the sea sounds a delivered Pun that begin as background and end by taking over the sentence the scene of writing.

347
00:21:58,086 --> 00:21:59,872
Speaker 0: that is a very good Sentence.

348
00:21:59,892 --> 00:22:03,086
Speaker 0: that itself is a good sentence if I see what he did there.

349
00:22:03,106 --> 00:22:19,454
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's very good Lava girl, so It's not a college humor But I mean the fact that you had to make a big deal of the fact that it wasn't is telling Illustrative of the problem.

350
00:22:19,856 --> 00:22:29,530
Speaker 1: so we will be met a moment at the penny arcade expo doing not one two three four But five panels three of which collapsed into one panel right for a total of three panels.

351
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:36,630
Speaker 0: There's a whole bunch of conventions the Zenkai con the week after PAX East anime Boston's like a month after that.

352
00:22:37,011 --> 00:22:38,738
Speaker 1: Next weekend February 11th Friday.

353
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:41,510
Speaker 1: We'll be at nerd NYC board game night at think coffee in Manhattan.

354
00:22:42,012 --> 00:22:47,070
Speaker 1: I only say this and keep saying it because we are there at almost every one of these and a lot of listeners show up.

355
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:49,158
Speaker 1: If you want to meet us hang out with us.

356
00:22:49,459 --> 00:22:53,201
Speaker 1: if you want to play modern art with me and Scott next Friday We'll be there.

357
00:22:53,222 --> 00:22:55,937
Speaker 0: All right You should go to our website.

358
00:22:56,058 --> 00:22:57,163
Speaker 0: It's broker calm.

359
00:22:57,183 --> 00:23:01,579
Speaker 0: You should Go to the forum forum the broker calm.

360
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:05,931
Speaker 1: you should read the geek nights book club book, which is currently Michio Kaku's Hyperspace.

361
00:23:05,991 --> 00:23:09,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, you should follow us on the Twitter's and all those sorts of things like that.

362
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,926
Speaker 0: You know Internet's people Internet's and That's enough metamome for now.

363
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,430
Speaker 1: So many of you are probably thinking rim and Scott.

364
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:28,911
Speaker 0: Why are you talking about an issue that's been dead for a decade because we couldn't come up with any other idea for a show Today and I came up with it and we never did a show on It.

365
00:23:29,031 --> 00:23:30,336
Speaker 0: so it deserves a show.

366
00:23:30,356 --> 00:23:31,280
Speaker 1: I think it's also.

367
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,970
Speaker 1: I mean, it's a debate like nowadays.

368
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:38,150
Speaker 1: I don't think anime fans remember the bullshit that used to go on.

369
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:43,384
Speaker 0: Well, I mean some of them some of them don't remember some of them don't care but it's definitely.

370
00:23:43,484 --> 00:23:45,570
Speaker 0: it's always there at the bottom.

371
00:23:45,671 --> 00:23:50,433
Speaker 0: It's just you know, there are some issues right that They're.

372
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:52,097
Speaker 0: they're pervasive issues, right.

373
00:23:52,137 --> 00:23:56,450
Speaker 0: and the number one pervasive issue for the last decade and a half is copyright.

374
00:23:56,871 --> 00:24:06,482
Speaker 0: but the thing is the copyright issue keeps rearing its head and coming back and coming back and coming back because New things keep happening to it and it keeps rearing and rearing and rearing.

375
00:24:06,522 --> 00:24:17,280
Speaker 0: but sub and dub was a big issue especially in the VHS days because you when you bought VHS had to pick you had to pick and The sub usually cost five to ten bucks more.

376
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:26,306
Speaker 0: Yep, not less and also many times you wouldn't have a choice Right, so it was a big issue then and more recently it was become less of an issue because DVD.

377
00:24:26,326 --> 00:24:36,750
Speaker 1: you buy the DVD and Everyone gets their own personal preference and it was a huge like people would get weird about it Like it was like the old school of fans like how dare you watch the dog?

378
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,879
Speaker 1: We could watch this job be perfect.

379
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,687
Speaker 1: And then the new fans like whatever.

380
00:24:40,727 --> 00:24:41,450
Speaker 1: I just wanna watch my show.

381
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:42,843
Speaker 1: Leave me alone you old fat nerd.

382
00:24:43,045 --> 00:24:50,090
Speaker 0: Yeah But yeah, basically, you know The fundamental thing here is you want you got a show some sort of piece of entertainment, right?

383
00:24:50,693 --> 00:24:54,210
Speaker 0: I mean we did do the show with the with the Oda King, right?

384
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,554
Speaker 0: You talked about subtitling.

385
00:24:55,654 --> 00:25:05,910
Speaker 0: a lot did you know and he but he was mostly complaining about the low quality of the fan subs And their method of subtitling and not whether subtitling or dubbing was better or worse.

386
00:25:06,111 --> 00:25:09,727
Speaker 1: I mean to do that that we could talk about fan dubbing if we really wanted.

387
00:25:09,748 --> 00:25:13,557
Speaker 0: no No, I mean the fundamental issue here right?

388
00:25:13,597 --> 00:25:24,716
Speaker 0: is you have some sort of artwork primarily, you know a video game or you know An anime right and you need to translate it so that people who do not speak the language It was originally creating can understand it.

389
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:25,679
Speaker 1: It's also a problem.

390
00:25:25,699 --> 00:25:29,390
Speaker 1: That's very particular to visual moving media.

391
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:32,222
Speaker 1: I mean, you're not gonna put subtitles on a book.

392
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,210
Speaker 1: You're just gonna translate it in most cases.

393
00:25:34,371 --> 00:25:37,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, no one's gonna complain about what was your method of translating the book?

394
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,516
Speaker 0: You know, it was translated.

395
00:25:39,557 --> 00:25:40,821
Speaker 1: what I would like that.

396
00:25:40,861 --> 00:25:41,685
Speaker 1: I'm actually surprised.

397
00:25:41,725 --> 00:25:42,247
Speaker 1: No one does.

398
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:46,801
Speaker 1: this is Subtitles for audio dramas just timed subtitles.

399
00:25:46,821 --> 00:25:49,850
Speaker 1: that are just subtitles that I can watch while I'm listening to an audio drama.

400
00:25:50,552 --> 00:25:50,813
Speaker 0: Why?

401
00:25:51,354 --> 00:25:55,386
Speaker 1: because there are a lot of audio dramas that are not translated that are actually supposedly good.

402
00:25:55,406 --> 00:25:57,395
Speaker 0: Oh I see what.

403
00:25:57,435 --> 00:26:08,036
Speaker 0: yeah, like basically the good listen You could listen to a Japanese audio drama while reading a translation of it because I could print out a translation But without the timing.

404
00:26:08,076 --> 00:26:09,422
Speaker 1: that's actually really hard to do.

405
00:26:09,522 --> 00:26:11,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, you have to figure out which line you're on.

406
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:15,245
Speaker 1: I mean, I've watched anime where I had just a script printed out and I'm watching it.

407
00:26:15,425 --> 00:26:17,673
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that was not Pleasant.

408
00:26:18,074 --> 00:26:20,064
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean, you know the fundamental problem is the other thing.

409
00:26:20,084 --> 00:26:21,330
Speaker 0: you might translate it, right?

410
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,678
Speaker 0: But you also in the translation, right?

411
00:26:23,758 --> 00:26:27,230
Speaker 0: Do you want how much do you want to be lost in the translation?

412
00:26:27,574 --> 00:26:29,613
Speaker 0: right and the Subtitle people?

413
00:26:29,653 --> 00:26:31,478
Speaker 0: their main arguments are like look.

414
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:36,030
Speaker 0: Okay, the subtitle at worst covers up a small part of the artwork, right?

415
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:46,147
Speaker 0: but maybe you can even do a letterbox and get it underneath or something right and Once you know how to read subtitles, it doesn't really distract your eyes from the from the picture at all.

416
00:26:46,167 --> 00:26:47,050
Speaker 1: That's a weird argument.

417
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:50,806
Speaker 1: I always was amazed by the people who would say that this they couldn't catch up with the subtitle.

418
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:51,630
Speaker 0: You just can't read.

419
00:26:51,852 --> 00:26:53,529
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got to hear not smart.

420
00:26:53,771 --> 00:26:58,028
Speaker 1: But then again part of that I was reading an article kind of relatedly a few days ago talking about maybe if

421
00:26:58,108 --> 00:26:59,255
Speaker 0: I problems or Something I don't know

422
00:26:59,295 --> 00:27:06,480
Speaker 1: talking about how a lot in most foreign countries subtitles are very very very common just for everyone even little kids even little kids.

423
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:11,564
Speaker 1: cartoons will often have subtitles in a lot of places because America makes a lot of the media.

424
00:27:11,604 --> 00:27:12,389
Speaker 1: that's in the world.

425
00:27:13,073 --> 00:27:17,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean there's plenty of dubs like how many Simpsons Seinfeld dubs have you seen?

426
00:27:18,272 --> 00:27:19,455
Speaker 1: But I'm saying for every dub.

427
00:27:19,476 --> 00:27:26,896
Speaker 1: There's a ton of subs and I don't see people complaining about Subtitles in other countries.

428
00:27:26,916 --> 00:27:28,361
Speaker 0: No, it's only in the US.

429
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:31,330
Speaker 0: I've ever seen people complain that there are subtitles.

430
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:34,970
Speaker 0: They're never subtitles on the US TV pretty much ever ever.

431
00:27:35,891 --> 00:27:41,470
Speaker 0: For like a crazy showing of a foreign film that's on like a weird foreign film, you know channel.

432
00:27:41,591 --> 00:27:44,162
Speaker 0: That's for you know, people who like that sort of thing.

433
00:27:44,303 --> 00:27:55,710
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, I mean look at us anime fans There was a time when we would watch live-action American like English things like the ratio hornblower and we would turn on the subtitles just because we were used to it.

434
00:27:55,810 --> 00:28:02,889
Speaker 0: Well, it was also because we'd be so loud while watching it So you wouldn't get you would have to pause it and rewind because you didn't hear that ratio.

435
00:28:06,012 --> 00:28:09,785
Speaker 1: But I'd always be startled when I didn't see subtitles, but I don't know it's.

436
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:12,715
Speaker 1: it's weird how Vitreolic it got.

437
00:28:12,735 --> 00:28:15,150
Speaker 1: like being in the RIT anime club a very large anime club.

438
00:28:15,592 --> 00:28:19,010
Speaker 1: There would be bitter arguments and like lost friendships over this sort of thing.

439
00:28:19,411 --> 00:28:33,550
Speaker 1: like the club would always show things subtitled because we had kind of this side reason of the fact that RIT is the NTID the National Technical Institute for the Deaf and the RIT anime club was actually very popular among deaf students because they could just watch the anime.

440
00:28:33,851 --> 00:28:39,553
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the thing was is we would always have the subtitles on no matter what because of the deaf Attendance.

441
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:43,788
Speaker 1: however as an aside, you should all know that subtitles and closed captioning are completely different.

442
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:44,310
Speaker 0: That's correct.

443
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,213
Speaker 1: They're very different things.

444
00:28:45,294 --> 00:28:49,650
Speaker 1: closed captioning will also note things like sound effects or noises.

445
00:28:50,011 --> 00:28:51,738
Speaker 1: Yeah, the subtitles do not by default.

446
00:28:51,778 --> 00:28:53,686
Speaker 1: if they do they're not really subtitles anymore.

447
00:28:53,847 --> 00:28:54,269
Speaker 0: That's true.

448
00:28:55,151 --> 00:29:02,532
Speaker 0: However, we would always have the subtitles on you know for those people because I don't know how many anime DVDs had full closed captioning On them.

449
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,419
Speaker 0: right, but and that was fine.

450
00:29:04,459 --> 00:29:06,789
Speaker 0: No one complained, you know, the deaf people were satisfied with that.

451
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:16,790
Speaker 0: However You know that sometimes I remember at least two or three incidents We would have the dub with subtitles on because you know the audience for every reason wanted to watch the dub.

452
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:21,068
Speaker 0: But you know the policy of the club was generally Japanese language with subtitles.

453
00:29:21,229 --> 00:29:23,159
Speaker 1: now I mean my argument.

454
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:27,598
Speaker 1: I mean I was on the eboard I was the president of the club I voted and we debated that sort of thing a lot.

455
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:38,790
Speaker 1: my argument for pretty much always showing subtitles was the one English dubs of Japanese Animation are some of the most god-awful pieces of shit I have ever heard in my life.

456
00:29:38,951 --> 00:29:40,944
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean not all of them are bad.

457
00:29:40,984 --> 00:29:41,910
Speaker 0: There are many good ones.

458
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:47,710
Speaker 0: However, you can have a discussion about how about which ones they are because there's so few of them, right?

459
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,337
Speaker 0: There's you know, the cowboy bebop.

460
00:29:49,377 --> 00:29:49,538
Speaker 0: Yep.

461
00:29:49,739 --> 00:29:54,038
Speaker 0: Some of the Disney Miyazakis are pretty good I'll sing had a surprisingly good dub.

462
00:29:54,098 --> 00:29:56,890
Speaker 0: some people like the ghost in the shell stand a little complex ones.

463
00:29:56,972 --> 00:30:02,570
Speaker 0: Okay, you know There are a lot of people who have a lot of nostalgia for like you get all the way down to hi I'm Fasha Stampede.

464
00:30:02,751 --> 00:30:04,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean there's some people have a lot of nostalgia.

465
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:09,345
Speaker 1: The worst dub ever to this day is Armitage the third poly matrix with Kiefer Sutherland.

466
00:30:09,405 --> 00:30:12,052
Speaker 0: No, you forgot about He.

467
00:30:12,112 --> 00:30:22,094
Speaker 1: literally a girl is like being shot and falling off of a cliff and on the screen the characters like Desperately jumping and reaching for and Kiefer Sutherland says no No, you got it.

468
00:30:22,114 --> 00:30:23,663
Speaker 0: What about the the gassaraki?

469
00:30:23,803 --> 00:30:25,030
Speaker 1: Oh my god that one extra.

470
00:30:25,151 --> 00:30:32,229
Speaker 1: The thing is the rest of the dub was actually pretty good It was alright, and there's that one guy who is like what's the matter you shiro?

471
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:38,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, remember, of course What's funny too is a lot of the older dubs and it's not just nostalgia.

472
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:42,790
Speaker 1: A lot of people say oh you just think the older dubs are better because that's what you grew up watching.

473
00:30:43,472 --> 00:30:49,950
Speaker 1: The older dubs were a lot freer and looser with the translation and as a result the acting I think was a lot better.

474
00:30:50,091 --> 00:30:57,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, the acting you know in many of them was was more and it was better in ways Actually worked pretty well.

475
00:30:58,693 --> 00:31:02,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was a lot less stiffness and other sorts of acting related problems.

476
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:14,110
Speaker 0: But I dub is hilarious, but in terms of you know purity to the original work, you know They had some serious issues, you know, pretty much most of well I mean there are some dubs that don't have such issues.

477
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:26,245
Speaker 0: But is that the older dubs definitely had those issues and part of the one thing that made your contributor is the insistence on not Only translating but sticking to you know making everything match the moving lips of the characters really

478
00:31:26,326 --> 00:31:27,129
Speaker 1: funny when you because

479
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:30,000
Speaker 0: the Japanese people don't even try to do that in the original.

480
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:34,236
Speaker 1: Yeah, you watch the original and nothing matches up at all I mean, there's no relation.

481
00:31:34,256 --> 00:31:37,005
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Japanese the original audio track didn't match.

482
00:31:37,045 --> 00:31:38,470
Speaker 0: So why should the dub match?

483
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:49,050
Speaker 0: Why should even matter, you know, I mean obviously if saying it in English Completely translated is gonna take ten times as long or a fraction of the time You still the time is still an issue, right?

484
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:49,933
Speaker 0: Like if you translate.

485
00:31:50,254 --> 00:31:58,737
Speaker 0: if someone says like, you know a word in Japanese and that somehow I don't know You know that translates to a sentence in English It's gonna be problematic or vice versa.

486
00:31:58,797 --> 00:32:09,610
Speaker 0: right if something's a big sentence in Japanese and you can just translate it to you know Fuck you or something like that That's a problem, but you don't have to match the actual syllables, you know.

487
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:12,270
Speaker 0: You just have to make sure it's the right length of time in there.

488
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:16,770
Speaker 1: Well, I remember this one time at RIT anime when we switched the dub on cowboy bebop.

489
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:22,432
Speaker 1: She watched the sub most of the way through and the club was like, hey the dub here is actually really good You want to.

490
00:32:22,472 --> 00:32:27,152
Speaker 0: well, there's a particular episode that you have to watch the mushroom Mushroom.

491
00:32:27,293 --> 00:32:36,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we watched that episode dub and then we just left the dub on yep And actually some people walked out like people walked out of that showing once the dub was turned on.

492
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,113
Speaker 0: I don't remember that.

493
00:32:37,474 --> 00:32:38,237
Speaker 1: remember a hoagie.

494
00:32:38,257 --> 00:32:38,980
Speaker 1: Steve walked out.

495
00:32:39,161 --> 00:32:39,582
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

496
00:32:39,623 --> 00:32:41,048
Speaker 1: He got super pissed when we changed it.

497
00:32:41,088 --> 00:32:45,506
Speaker 1: We voted yeah, and him the whole room voted and a few other people I could name.

498
00:32:45,526 --> 00:32:48,962
Speaker 1: they all walked out and They were mad about it.

499
00:32:48,982 --> 00:32:50,030
Speaker 1: They were mad that we switched.

500
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:50,894
Speaker 0: I don't remember them.

501
00:32:51,095 --> 00:33:03,188
Speaker 1: anyone walking out perfectly Bible dub and One of them his sighted reason and he grumbled about it for a while Loudly before he just left was that during the the beta mags VCR episode of the VHS in the beta.

502
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:13,322
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm There's this one scene where the guy who has the VCR is going on this long rant about technology that no one cares about like Well back in the day beta was this bla bla bla bla.

503
00:33:13,362 --> 00:33:14,830
Speaker 1: She's like this long rant and it's funny.

504
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:25,969
Speaker 1: the subtitles did not match what the guy was saying in the dub and This fanboy was like see see the dub is way off from the subtitles.

505
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:26,290
Speaker 1: the dub.

506
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:27,336
Speaker 1: Oh, you're accurate.

507
00:33:27,376 --> 00:33:29,930
Speaker 0: You're assuming that the subtitle is correct also.

508
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:36,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, the subtitles were also way off because it was a translation of something that it didn't even matter what the guy was saying.

509
00:33:36,791 --> 00:33:38,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess what bothered me.

510
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:46,910
Speaker 0: that is the thing is if you don't know the original language There's sort of this assumption that the subtitle be you know is a is a the best translation, right?

511
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:49,682
Speaker 0: You just assume that because it's it has this authoritarian.

512
00:33:49,722 --> 00:33:51,430
Speaker 0: It's just it's in a position of authority.

513
00:33:51,871 --> 00:33:58,070
Speaker 0: So if a dub doesn't match it that the assumption is that the dub is wrong more wrong than the subtitle always.

514
00:33:58,312 --> 00:33:59,742
Speaker 0: Yep, but you know, it could just be.

515
00:33:59,783 --> 00:34:10,030
Speaker 0: they're two different translations of the same thing and They're both equally off in different directions and you have to look at each case Individually and you have to know the original language to make a judgment call.

516
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:10,994
Speaker 1: But that's what bothers me.

517
00:34:11,255 --> 00:34:16,679
Speaker 1: almost every bitch like intelligent people can argue the merits of both Intelligently and come to a conclusion.

518
00:34:17,141 --> 00:34:28,803
Speaker 1: I have my preferences I can articulate them I can understand other people's preferences, but the fanboys on both sides would Basically be wrong about the technical aspects of translation.

519
00:34:29,103 --> 00:34:38,784
Speaker 0: They didn't know Japanese usually and They would basically just argue from this position if you know Japanese you don't care if it's dub or so as you can just do either way.

520
00:34:38,984 --> 00:34:53,489
Speaker 1: my stance though, is that When in doubt unless you have a reason to watch the dub like for example If you're doing something else and you're watching the anime casually the dubs fine But if you actually want to see the real show you should watch the subs.

521
00:34:54,012 --> 00:34:59,048
Speaker 1: But I think the dub is better for someone who does not watch a lot of like.

522
00:34:59,088 --> 00:35:02,290
Speaker 1: if it's anime Who doesn't watch a lot of anime in Japanese?

523
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,154
Speaker 1: They don't like.

524
00:35:04,294 --> 00:35:05,278
Speaker 1: get the language like.

525
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:07,708
Speaker 1: I don't understand Japanese that well at all me.

526
00:35:07,728 --> 00:35:09,476
Speaker 0: Hey there but why?

527
00:35:09,517 --> 00:35:22,842
Speaker 1: having watched anime for the last 20 years I Can understand the inflection like if I hear Japanese being spoken and I see a translation that is accurate next to it I understand all the emotion you can kind of feel it.

528
00:35:22,862 --> 00:35:32,550
Speaker 1: you understand all these kind of subtle aspects of the language even without understanding the individual words and Dubs translate that better for someone who is not familiar with the Japanese language.

529
00:35:32,659 --> 00:35:43,421
Speaker 0: well if they're if they're done well right and I think that pretty much means that you shouldn't start someone who's never watched anime before who might be a fan of it is Coming into it shouldn't watch a bad show right.

530
00:35:43,521 --> 00:35:48,362
Speaker 0: and if if they if you know if they're gonna start with a dub I mean we started with dubs right on TV.

531
00:35:48,382 --> 00:35:49,790
Speaker 0: They didn't start with no subs.

532
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:50,978
Speaker 1: Yeah, vampire hunter D.

533
00:35:51,038 --> 00:36:02,070
Speaker 0: Kashawn robot hunter project echo You got to watch something where you know that if the dub is not good Then if they're going to watch a dub show no matter what then that's not a good show.

534
00:36:02,272 --> 00:36:03,389
Speaker 0: They have to watch something different.

535
00:36:03,591 --> 00:36:10,570
Speaker 1: Well, the trouble is what I run into is there were a lot of people who weren't anime fans So I would try to get into the anime and I didn't want to show them dubs.

536
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:15,650
Speaker 1: This was like high school and middle school because the dubs were god-awful and I could even tell they were god-awful.

537
00:36:15,871 --> 00:36:27,671
Speaker 1: Yep, because and think of this if you say you hear a show on in the other room You can always tell if it's an American anime dub versus any other kind of show just by listening to it For

538
00:36:27,691 --> 00:36:30,024
Speaker 0: like a second just based on the way the people talk.

539
00:36:30,084 --> 00:36:33,498
Speaker 0: because they don't you know They're not talking the same way regular people talk.

540
00:36:33,538 --> 00:36:36,990
Speaker 1: They're not talking the way voice actors and anything but anime talk.

541
00:36:37,331 --> 00:36:37,752
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

542
00:36:37,773 --> 00:36:39,238
Speaker 0: Well video games also.

543
00:36:39,318 --> 00:36:40,281
Speaker 1: video games are just as bad.

544
00:36:40,301 --> 00:36:47,850
Speaker 1: That's a bad, you know, you're right, but Basically everyone I tried to show anime to I couldn't show him the dubs because the dubs were terrible.

545
00:36:48,453 --> 00:36:52,390
Speaker 1: And if I tried to show him a sub they'd say the fuck are these subtitles and they refused to watch.

546
00:36:52,571 --> 00:36:53,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's that's the thing.

547
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,170
Speaker 0: It's like you got both sides, right?

548
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:56,074
Speaker 0: There's the fanboy.

549
00:36:56,114 --> 00:36:57,018
Speaker 0: who's such a fanboy?

550
00:36:57,058 --> 00:37:00,010
Speaker 0: he refused to watch a dub and he's stupid for his own reasons.

551
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:03,964
Speaker 0: But then the person who says I refuse to watch this, you know subtitles.

552
00:37:04,204 --> 00:37:06,938
Speaker 0: They're stupid for their own reasons You know, it's like you got these.

553
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,590
Speaker 0: it's stupid versus stupid.

554
00:37:08,751 --> 00:37:14,855
Speaker 0: And the truth is is that you should probably watch subtitles most of the time But it does not.

555
00:37:14,935 --> 00:37:15,758
Speaker 0: all dubs are bad.

556
00:37:15,798 --> 00:37:16,762
Speaker 0: There are good dubs.

557
00:37:17,002 --> 00:37:17,605
Speaker 0: They exist.

558
00:37:17,825 --> 00:37:19,110
Speaker 0: They're not gonna kill anybody.

559
00:37:19,574 --> 00:37:21,290
Speaker 0: Right, there's reasons for them to exist.

560
00:37:22,914 --> 00:37:34,289
Speaker 1: For example a show that is very like certain kinds of shows probably would be better served by a well-done dub Because the well-done dub is more natural to anyone who isn't fluent in the language.

561
00:37:35,012 --> 00:37:37,300
Speaker 1: However, there are almost no well-done dubs.

562
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:46,681
Speaker 1: So it's kind of like arguing about whether or not unicorns are blue or red Or the size of Gandalf's dick, I just can't seven inches.

563
00:37:46,761 --> 00:37:51,202
Speaker 1: I cannot express to you how Crazy this argument used to be.

564
00:37:51,262 --> 00:37:53,211
Speaker 1: you young anime fans have no idea Like I wish.

565
00:37:53,472 --> 00:38:04,994
Speaker 1: I wish I could just take like go back in time and film like RIT anime in the year 2000 1999 oh my god, like it was fierce But to this day.

566
00:38:05,054 --> 00:38:13,010
Speaker 1: like look at conventions and all the people still fight about it But only the fanboys fight about it because not that many people watch anime at conventions anymore.

567
00:38:13,171 --> 00:38:13,612
Speaker 1: I think that's.

568
00:38:13,652 --> 00:38:18,792
Speaker 1: part of the reason why it's not an issue is that the culture is not a culture of watching collectively.

569
00:38:19,094 --> 00:38:26,449
Speaker 1: it's a culture of watching your fans subs on your own watch your country roll on your own and Then if you get together you get together at a con and just hang out.

570
00:38:26,678 --> 00:38:32,241
Speaker 0: Yeah I do think that it's sort of like, you know There's a good part and a bad part to the fact that you know the.

571
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:37,158
Speaker 0: because of the collapse of the anime industry There's not that much dubbing going on as it used to be.

572
00:38:37,279 --> 00:38:45,710
Speaker 0: only the few animes that get on DVD are dubbed and even now You know, there's been more recently some subtitle only DVD releases towards the at least towards the end days.

573
00:38:46,071 --> 00:38:50,450
Speaker 1: Guarantee of a dub is if it's gonna be on TV right or they're trying to get it on TV.

574
00:38:50,992 --> 00:39:01,375
Speaker 0: but in most of the all the animes that are on crunchyroll and Streaming on the funimation in the anime news network and fan subbed and all these shows right are pretty much Subtitle only.

575
00:39:01,778 --> 00:39:18,069
Speaker 0: and I think this is good in a way Because the car the modern anime fans are watching shows now or going back to watch old shows Right are getting you know, the better truer subtitled Experience and there's no weird bad dubs to turn them off or anything like that.

576
00:39:18,573 --> 00:39:25,790
Speaker 0: You know, so the people who are watching anime now I think you're getting a better appreciation for anime and the Japanese language and these sorts of things.

577
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:29,065
Speaker 0: however, I think it's actually it's sort of like.

578
00:39:29,145 --> 00:39:32,001
Speaker 0: it's sort of like a Closing the door, right?

579
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:33,450
Speaker 0: It's like anime went downhill.

580
00:39:33,952 --> 00:39:38,830
Speaker 0: So now it's subtitled only and now anime can't go back uphill because there's no dubs to get new people.

581
00:39:39,071 --> 00:39:41,605
Speaker 1: At the same time so many people won't watch some.

582
00:39:41,766 --> 00:39:45,047
Speaker 1: among youth culture I found just looking around more and more.

583
00:39:45,067 --> 00:39:50,707
Speaker 1: Is that references to anime are just a general understanding of knowing what Naruto is like?

584
00:39:50,747 --> 00:40:02,298
Speaker 1: this kind of It's very widely known among young kids you know if they don't watch a lot of anime almost every punk kid you ever run into has seen some anime knows what it Is and treats it just like they'd create any other TV.

585
00:40:02,799 --> 00:40:08,529
Speaker 1: in a way the anime fans that were trying so hard to make anime regular basically mainstream.

586
00:40:09,352 --> 00:40:22,050
Speaker 1: One in that as anime became more and more accepted and more and more mainstream the culture around it disappeared because There's very little real culture except for the hardcore people around the Simpsons in America.

587
00:40:22,952 --> 00:40:25,579
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, that's that hardcore Simpsons fanboy.

588
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,121
Speaker 1: They exist.

589
00:40:26,582 --> 00:40:27,745
Speaker 1: Most people just watch the Simpsons.

590
00:40:27,785 --> 00:40:29,450
Speaker 1: They're not gonna go to a Simpsons convention.

591
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:32,498
Speaker 0: Yeah only the super hardcore people are gonna go to a Simpsons convention.

592
00:40:32,518 --> 00:40:36,734
Speaker 1: but people who know about TV might go to a TV convention cuz.

593
00:40:36,774 --> 00:40:38,200
Speaker 1: oh, yeah, they go to the Simpsons there.

594
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,510
Speaker 0: I'll go see that and there might be some Simpsons action there.

595
00:40:40,591 --> 00:40:41,950
Speaker 0: Yeah at a TV convention.

596
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:52,869
Speaker 1: But I think anime cons have gone down the same road and I think this is part of the reason why the dub sub debate Has disappeared because the collective watching of anime is no more popular now than the collective watching of TV.

597
00:40:53,572 --> 00:40:55,357
Speaker 1: Yeah, you watched anime the same way.

598
00:40:55,377 --> 00:40:59,129
Speaker 1: you watch TV mostly alone maybe with one person on your computer.

599
00:40:59,393 --> 00:41:11,759
Speaker 0: Yeah But yeah, I mean, you know there there are issues in terms of the quality of subtitling but we discussed that in Don't watch crappy fans with the Oda King right back in the day.

600
00:41:11,779 --> 00:41:18,861
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, and there's also the issues of What's it called with two different kinds of translations?

601
00:41:19,122 --> 00:41:21,229
Speaker 0: Well, no, we talked about that also with the Oda King.

602
00:41:22,073 --> 00:41:22,737
Speaker 0: Oh, what do you got?

603
00:41:22,757 --> 00:41:23,320
Speaker 1: What do you get?

604
00:41:23,622 --> 00:41:23,903
Speaker 1: Nothing?

605
00:41:24,185 --> 00:41:24,447
Speaker 1: Nothing?

606
00:41:24,467 --> 00:41:25,010
Speaker 1: You got nothing?

607
00:41:25,712 --> 00:41:30,530
Speaker 0: Right like sometimes right like on the the the Gundam the Z Gundam.

608
00:41:32,513 --> 00:41:38,790
Speaker 0: Right, the subtitles are just like all busted and you know, they fixed them on the other disc, right?

609
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:41,793
Speaker 0: So it's like a mother, you know You some.

610
00:41:41,914 --> 00:41:45,226
Speaker 0: just cuz it's subtitles right doesn't mean that it's good either.

611
00:41:45,286 --> 00:41:54,050
Speaker 0: There are plenty of bad Subtitles out there, you know a lot of people to sort of take for granted The subtitles are right and good or whatever, but that is not always the case.

612
00:41:54,732 --> 00:41:59,090
Speaker 0: So, you know and especially in the olden days if there were bad subtitles, right?

613
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:03,285
Speaker 0: You paid more for that VHS with subtitles than the dub one than the dub VHS.

614
00:42:03,405 --> 00:42:04,750
Speaker 0: You would be hella pissed off.

615
00:42:05,305 --> 00:42:10,448
Speaker 1: Yeah It is interesting that the subtitled ones were more expensive because there was less demand for them.

616
00:42:10,789 --> 00:42:12,135
Speaker 0: yet They were cheaper to make.

617
00:42:12,235 --> 00:42:24,460
Speaker 1: yet at the same time anime fanboys by and large preferred subtitles Yeah Which meant that a lot of non anime hardcore fanboys were buying anime back when it was 30 bucks a tape Four episodes.

618
00:42:24,862 --> 00:42:30,790
Speaker 0: Well, maybe two episodes But some of the thing is a lot of the VHS tapes most of the sales were to like blockbusters.

619
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:35,075
Speaker 0: Yeah, so and a lot of those things were so it were you know That were released early on.

620
00:42:35,095 --> 00:42:38,510
Speaker 0: VHS were mega popular things like Akira that everyone and their mother would buy.

621
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:44,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, the anime section of blockbuster when I was a kid was bigger than the anime section of blockbuster when I was in college.

622
00:42:44,751 --> 00:42:52,970
Speaker 0: the Akira dub VHS definitely sold way way more than this the rare subtitle VHS even though I've seen that subtitle VHS plenty.

623
00:42:59,223 --> 00:43:01,760
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
