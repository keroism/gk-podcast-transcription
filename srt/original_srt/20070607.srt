1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,075
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, June 7th.

2
00:00:12,695 --> 00:00:13,236
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,537 --> 00:00:15,740
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:22,104
Speaker 1: Tonight we talk about the great the awesome the amazing Lord.

5
00:00:22,304 --> 00:00:35,182
Speaker 1: Admiral Horatio hornblower You know what one of my favorite pastimes is Sleeping sitting in traffic on 287 trying to drive to white Plains to pick up a tuxedo.

6
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:42,690
Speaker 1: Oh I couldn't go during work because actually I was getting part of my car fixed this morning.

7
00:00:43,233 --> 00:00:44,642
Speaker 1: So I had to wait until after work.

8
00:00:44,663 --> 00:00:50,775
Speaker 1: I just I left a little bit early You know went up the sawmill gonna catch 287 across to that God awful.

9
00:00:50,835 --> 00:00:53,849
Speaker 1: Westchester Mall and go in and pick up my tuxedo and go.

10
00:00:55,011 --> 00:01:02,850
Speaker 1: so, uh, I get to the exit that says 287 and I pull about 20 feet down it and then I realized the traffic has just stopped.

11
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:05,003
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're not going anywhere and it was.

12
00:01:05,043 --> 00:01:06,210
Speaker 1: it's not like it was an accident or anything.

13
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,923
Speaker 1: It's just that's what that road is like.

14
00:01:08,306 --> 00:01:18,027
Speaker 1: pretty much Well in that part of it going in that direction at that time or the other direction pretty much 287 between the Hudson River and White Plains is not actually a road.

15
00:01:18,088 --> 00:01:19,313
Speaker 1: It's a parking lot I don't use.

16
00:01:19,393 --> 00:01:22,710
Speaker 0: I use it mostly in the Jersey side like for the Tappan Zee Bridge West.

17
00:01:22,811 --> 00:01:25,346
Speaker 0: I don't use the eastern part of that see over in Jersey.

18
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:26,010
Speaker 1: It's pretty nice.

19
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,688
Speaker 1: That's how we get to all the good places we go.

20
00:01:27,951 --> 00:01:28,780
Speaker 0: Well, cuz it's sort of.

21
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:42,685
Speaker 0: it's like the east-west Highway because Jersey has the two big north-south highways the turnpike in the Garden State But 287 is sort of the east-west and it allows you to get from New York to Jersey Without going all the way to New York City to use like the George Washington Bridge.

22
00:01:42,705 --> 00:01:46,846
Speaker 1: You can use the Tappan Zee Bridge Yeah, but now after an hour driving I get there no big deal.

23
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:57,928
Speaker 1: All right the crowd of people waiting around This after-hours tuxedo let alone the people crammed inside of it was staggering.

24
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:02,505
Speaker 1: Wow Basically though I realized that while they're all it was the same deal.

25
00:02:02,545 --> 00:02:10,473
Speaker 1: where there's only like two people running the store and they're all you know, like avoiding eye contact with anyone waiting and just like trying to get work done and Dealing with police.

26
00:02:10,494 --> 00:02:13,349
Speaker 0: They were trying to get work done as opposed to standing there looking at you going.

27
00:02:13,369 --> 00:02:14,156
Speaker 0: Sorry You have to wait.

28
00:02:14,258 --> 00:02:17,281
Speaker 1: Well the work they did Seem like they're doing real work.

29
00:02:17,301 --> 00:02:20,189
Speaker 1: I don't know how that company is set up But it doesn't look like anyone ever does real work.

30
00:02:20,531 --> 00:02:26,890
Speaker 1: They all do like barely useless looking paperwork or they just kind of stand there looking at pieces of paper and not moving.

31
00:02:27,051 --> 00:02:27,994
Speaker 0: Why do they have paper?

32
00:02:28,436 --> 00:02:28,737
Speaker 0: It's it.

33
00:02:28,838 --> 00:02:33,026
Speaker 0: they should only have tuxedos, I guess maybe scissors Computers.

34
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:38,030
Speaker 0: What else do they need regardless like white chalk stuff to do Taylor?

35
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:48,170
Speaker 1: I did something I don't often do because I generally whenever there's some sort of Self-organized system because it looked like people are kind of form themselves into a line, but it was not explicit.

36
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:54,610
Speaker 1: It was entirely implicit and people were kind of going along with it and I realized this is going to be a bad situation.

37
00:02:54,711 --> 00:03:03,810
Speaker 1: I'm gonna have to wait here forever and I decided at that point that it was time To in the in the full use of the prisoner's dilemma defect against society.

38
00:03:04,011 --> 00:03:05,676
Speaker 0: There you go, and I just walked past.

39
00:03:05,716 --> 00:03:15,290
Speaker 1: all the people walked right up to the lady who was typing stuff in somewhere said, excuse me I'm here to pick up a tuxedo and before she could say, you know, you're gonna have to wait or stand in line.

40
00:03:15,752 --> 00:03:17,279
Speaker 1: I just kept right going with.

41
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:18,646
Speaker 1: I got to catch the flight.

42
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:19,550
Speaker 1: I just got to pick this thing up.

43
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:42,229
Speaker 1: I arranged with the lady before to pick it up at 530 and before she could say she stopped for a second and she went to say something else and I just kept talking and I kept talking and I every time I stopped if she started to protest I said something else and This worked beautifully and eventually she realized that there was no way short of interrupting me and you can't interrupt the customer To make me go away.

44
00:03:42,712 --> 00:03:46,570
Speaker 1: So she gave me my tuxedo and then I went on my way past all those people.

45
00:03:46,891 --> 00:03:54,265
Speaker 1: I saved about an hour and a half awaiting and Other than a little bit of confusion with what they were actually supposed to give me which I sorted out eventually.

46
00:03:54,286 --> 00:03:57,336
Speaker 1: I Realized that it's over.

47
00:03:57,517 --> 00:03:58,099
Speaker 1: I've defected.

48
00:03:58,119 --> 00:04:01,010
Speaker 1: I just wrote orange on the piece of paper and collected my thousand dollars.

49
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:03,663
Speaker 0: That's how it's done when people are giving you shit.

50
00:04:03,724 --> 00:04:05,795
Speaker 0: You gotta take control You can't let.

51
00:04:05,855 --> 00:04:08,390
Speaker 0: you can't let stupid people fuck it up for the for you.

52
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,353
Speaker 1: well see the thing is.

53
00:04:09,714 --> 00:04:19,869
Speaker 1: it's kind of funny because this happens at conventions a lot where a Connell say don't line up or there won't be a system of waiting for something because they don't want people to spend their whole con waiting for something.

54
00:04:20,555 --> 00:04:36,854
Speaker 1: So people who are stupid or People who don't realize what's going on or people who just feel entitled to wait despite being told not to or despite They're not being a system will often create a mini society on their own and expect other people to follow the rules of this tiny Society they have created.

55
00:04:37,296 --> 00:04:50,708
Speaker 1: they'll stand in a line that they've made up and expect people to stand behind them and I like the fact that Otacon and all the good cons Respond to this usually by forming a line somewhere else and not letting those people in until last.

56
00:04:51,109 --> 00:04:52,555
Speaker 0: yeah That's always good too.

57
00:04:52,916 --> 00:05:00,770
Speaker 1: And in the real world when there's no con staff to deal with anyone I think the best solution is just to walk past these people because they'll never say anything.

58
00:05:01,212 --> 00:05:03,503
Speaker 1: They'll just get indignant and then I can just go on my way.

59
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:04,648
Speaker 0: What are you gonna do about it?

60
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:12,230
Speaker 0: What if you don't have any authority to control me or tell me what to do, then what are you upset about now?

61
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:12,933
Speaker 1: There's a difference.

62
00:05:12,993 --> 00:05:17,939
Speaker 1: if there's a real line like you're in line at the grocery store to pay and someone cuts in front of you That's not cool.

63
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,929
Speaker 0: That's a real line.

64
00:05:19,138 --> 00:05:28,190
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm saying when there isn't a real line if some group of people just arbitrarily Desides that they're gonna make some up some rules up, you know, it doesn't have to be a line.

65
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,865
Speaker 0: It could be anything like, you know, we've decided no one in this room can say this word.

66
00:05:32,925 --> 00:05:34,109
Speaker 0: It's like no.

67
00:05:35,953 --> 00:05:37,220
Speaker 1: That reminds me of that Penn Jillette.

68
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,199
Speaker 1: when there's that woman who went on and on about her No one swears in her business and this big deal about.

69
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,885
Speaker 1: you shouldn't swear in this whole thing.

70
00:05:43,307 --> 00:05:49,570
Speaker 1: and her friend was there Interviewing her about it and then at the very end the friend just said fuck and the woman totally freaked out.

71
00:05:49,771 --> 00:05:52,303
Speaker 0: Oh, I think the friend said shit, but she said something like that.

72
00:05:52,324 --> 00:05:52,866
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

73
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:59,847
Speaker 0: She said a bad I think she gave the friend like a sign to hang up in her store and the friend was just like oh shit.

74
00:06:00,288 --> 00:06:06,758
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah Yeah, but also a little hint for all of you out there.

75
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,774
Speaker 1: the technique I used to get service will work in most Service situations.

76
00:06:13,296 --> 00:06:15,101
Speaker 1: The key is don't be rude.

77
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:15,743
Speaker 1: Don't yell.

78
00:06:15,824 --> 00:06:17,228
Speaker 1: Don't be like that.

79
00:06:17,248 --> 00:06:17,930
Speaker 1: I gotta be out of here.

80
00:06:18,271 --> 00:06:19,013
Speaker 1: Be very polite.

81
00:06:19,354 --> 00:06:24,330
Speaker 1: In fact, if you want even be overly polite be act a little bit stupid.

82
00:06:24,935 --> 00:06:31,150
Speaker 1: Give the impression that you don't Understand that they are busy or that there is a line or that that you have to wait.

83
00:06:31,511 --> 00:06:44,750
Speaker 1: Just keep bringing things up and like oh, well, I gotta pick this up cuz the flight man flying to Rochester blah blah blah oh, but I gotta pick up this yeah, duh duh duh duh and my dog and They can't call you out because they'll get in trouble.

84
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:49,770
Speaker 1: The only thing they will be able to do in most cases is serve you immediately and be done with you.

85
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,743
Speaker 1: Lesson number eight in rims how to get what you want by defecting on society.

86
00:06:55,764 --> 00:06:56,747
Speaker 1: Yeah.

87
00:06:57,007 --> 00:06:57,509
Speaker 0: All right.

Speaker 1: hey Scott is real tired.

91
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:05,687
Speaker 1: I got to admit I came home and usually when I come home I get irk.

92
00:07:05,707 --> 00:07:08,430
Speaker 1: Scott comes home I get the tirade of oh my god rim.

93
00:07:08,491 --> 00:07:09,829
Speaker 1: What did I see on the internet today?

94
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:15,088
Speaker 1: but a video of some guy getting hit in the nuts and there's this tech news and he just talked about it at.

95
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:23,427
Speaker 1: and today I Came home and other than the fact that Scott's car was there I had no idea Scott was home until I walked into the living room and he didn't acknowledge my presence.

96
00:07:23,929 --> 00:07:29,290
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, so what he got in the news say is a pretty funny Park style news.

97
00:07:29,572 --> 00:07:31,643
Speaker 1: Oh, usually I'm the one who cops out and does the FARC.

98
00:07:31,865 --> 00:07:32,770
Speaker 0: No, it's Thursday.

99
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:33,493
Speaker 0: What do you want from me?

100
00:07:33,975 --> 00:07:35,280
Speaker 0: and we were laughing about this at work.

101
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:37,449
Speaker 0: anyway, so some guy has.

102
00:07:38,851 --> 00:07:42,422
Speaker 0: He's a 22 year old guy and he had muscular dystrophy.

103
00:07:42,642 --> 00:07:43,906
Speaker 0: So he's in a wheelchair now.

104
00:07:44,187 --> 00:07:45,070
Speaker 1: All right, that's bad.

105
00:07:45,251 --> 00:07:47,399
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, I think he was it.

106
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:50,370
Speaker 0: see I didn't read all the details and he was at a gas station.

107
00:07:50,651 --> 00:07:54,307
Speaker 0: Oh, no, he was crossing a highway in his little electron.

108
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:55,090
Speaker 0: Oh, wait a minute.

109
00:07:55,713 --> 00:07:59,710
Speaker 1: I know I figured out cuz I did read the FARC headlines, but I didn't follow up.

110
00:08:00,172 --> 00:08:03,145
Speaker 1: I think I know what FARC headline refers to your story.

111
00:08:03,326 --> 00:08:07,700
Speaker 1: Okay, I So involving a land speed record of a wheelchair something like that.

112
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:13,889
Speaker 0: Okay, so he's going across the highway in his little wheelchair and The semi-truck didn't see him.

113
00:08:14,525 --> 00:08:22,660
Speaker 0: well the story here says that the semi-truck didn't see him and His wheelchair got caught on the grill of the semi.

114
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:39,208
Speaker 0: So basically the semi is behind this guy pushing him forward and it took him on the highway for a bunch of miles and it took him up to 50 miles an hour and People kept calling 911 and eventually the cops believed it because they didn't believe it at first.

115
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:46,550
Speaker 1: I Can imagine being the guy on the front cuz that but imagine being the truck driver when you finally get pulled.

116
00:08:47,353 --> 00:08:48,807
Speaker 0: Believe it until he saw it.

117
00:08:49,331 --> 00:08:52,970
Speaker 1: Imagine this you get pulled over by the police and you're like officer my speeding.

118
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:57,607
Speaker 1: They're like, no, you're pushing a disabled man in the front of your truck in a wheelchair.

119
00:08:57,627 --> 00:09:09,690
Speaker 0: Yep I would probably just laugh and be like Yeah, I was actually said the ride was kind of fun if it wasn't for the fact that you know If a few more miles he would have died because his tires would have disintegrated.

120
00:09:10,631 --> 00:09:16,652
Speaker 1: I just can't imagine what situation in the physical world would actually bring this about and I wonder whose fault It was.

121
00:09:16,913 --> 00:09:17,937
Speaker 1: was he in a crosswalk?

122
00:09:17,977 --> 00:09:18,439
Speaker 1: was he Jay?

123
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:21,050
Speaker 1: Well, I guess Jay walking isn't the relevant.

124
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:24,304
Speaker 0: Well here the ear two things I thought of the guys at work.

125
00:09:24,745 --> 00:09:25,830
Speaker 0: It was their thinking.

126
00:09:26,031 --> 00:09:32,310
Speaker 0: I mean, obviously the story says that this was you know an accident which is I guess the most believable situation.

127
00:09:32,574 --> 00:09:33,549
Speaker 1: No, I don't know.

128
00:09:35,292 --> 00:09:38,290
Speaker 0: Oh really there are two alternate scenarios that I think are pretty plausible.

129
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:44,450
Speaker 1: The reason I don't deny is that I can't think of many human beings who would willfully put themselves in either of these situations.

130
00:09:44,874 --> 00:10:03,025
Speaker 0: Well, you know if you look at the guy the people at work some co-workers thought that he was trying to off himself and I personally if you look at the way that The wheelchair is like stuck to the grill of this truck It looks like he tried to get it stuck there like it's like perfectly wedged in.

131
00:10:03,407 --> 00:10:06,738
Speaker 0: so either it's Coincidentally just just the right.

132
00:10:06,858 --> 00:10:09,970
Speaker 0: Well, it's nice or he tried to take a ride on this truck.

133
00:10:10,311 --> 00:10:17,824
Speaker 1: It just seems weird that the truck would somehow have hit him in order to move him this way and yet he was Oriented in the proper direction.

134
00:10:17,865 --> 00:10:18,710
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

135
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:19,693
Speaker 0: That's why it's.

136
00:10:19,773 --> 00:10:31,229
Speaker 0: I think while it's most likely an accident as the story says I think there's a good chance of Him going for a wild ride or I guess there's a least chance of the three.

137
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,881
Speaker 0: is You know off himself because they're trying to off himself.

138
00:10:34,122 --> 00:10:35,549
Speaker 0: There's a lot easier ways to do it.

139
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:41,150
Speaker 1: Well, maybe he's one of those people who you want to off yourself, but you don't really want to die.

140
00:10:41,431 --> 00:10:42,658
Speaker 1: It's just you know, you're going to die.

141
00:10:42,678 --> 00:10:44,689
Speaker 1: So you're gonna off yourself for whatever reason ahead of time.

142
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:52,330
Speaker 1: So instead of just killing yourself you do increasingly dangerous risk-taking awesome things like the guy who trained surfed.

143
00:10:52,712 --> 00:10:59,010
Speaker 0: oh, maybe I think the The funny thing here is the guy has this shirt that says I'm a pepper.

144
00:11:01,292 --> 00:11:02,256
Speaker 1: That wasn't what I expected.

145
00:11:02,276 --> 00:11:03,583
Speaker 0: yeah, it's like this red shirt.

146
00:11:03,603 --> 00:11:04,990
Speaker 0: it says I'm a pepper and it's pretty funny.

147
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:06,050
Speaker 1: You know now that I think about it.

148
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:19,510
Speaker 1: This does remind me of a story that this was a year or two ago where a guy called 911 from his car on a freeway Claiming that his accelerator for whatever reason he couldn't close it and he couldn't stop the car and his brakes.

149
00:11:19,651 --> 00:11:23,327
Speaker 1: Just he held him down and they wouldn't stop the car enough for him to get out.

150
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:27,350
Speaker 1: and now they're busted Because he held him down and he's actually an excuse to speed down the highway.

151
00:11:27,531 --> 00:11:33,109
Speaker 1: So he's going down the highway with the basically the pedal down going as fast as car will go.

152
00:11:33,631 --> 00:11:38,370
Speaker 1: The state troopers still clear off the road to give the guy room until he runs out of gas or whatever.

153
00:11:38,912 --> 00:11:42,752
Speaker 1: But like 10 miles down the road, there's a big toll booth thing that there's no way he'd make it through like.

154
00:11:42,772 --> 00:11:43,621
Speaker 1: he'd probably just die.

155
00:11:43,641 --> 00:11:49,629
Speaker 1: and magically the car like comes under control and he brings it to a stop like a mile before that thing.

156
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:55,910
Speaker 1: and Then you know mechanics suspect the car and find nothing wrong with it and I think the guy went to jail or something.

157
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:56,714
Speaker 1: I don't remember how that.

158
00:11:57,076 --> 00:11:57,237
Speaker 0: see.

159
00:11:57,358 --> 00:12:02,602
Speaker 0: I would have gone through the toll booth at the full speed Until I made it over the state border, then I'd slow down.

160
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:04,550
Speaker 1: Ah, I don't know.

161
00:12:04,852 --> 00:12:06,870
Speaker 1: You really would have had to rig that ahead of time.

162
00:12:07,251 --> 00:12:11,730
Speaker 1: Did the guy really think that the police wouldn't get a mechanic to look at what was going on in his car?

163
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:15,090
Speaker 0: Maybe what you could do is sabotage your car on purpose.

164
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:20,307
Speaker 1: See, I don't think he thought I think it was in the car and he thought I know how I can get away with this.

165
00:12:23,072 --> 00:12:26,223
Speaker 0: I Kind of what is clever plan through.

166
00:12:26,243 --> 00:12:41,036
Speaker 1: I mean once in my life I did that not now with the lying part But the put the pedal all the way down and just held it there For a long time and the car got up to about a hundred and twenty six 27 and the whole time

167
00:12:41,417 --> 00:12:42,199
Speaker 0: the car was shaking.

168
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,444
Speaker 1: No, the car wasn't shaking.

169
00:12:43,564 --> 00:12:44,507
Speaker 1: No that car.

170
00:12:44,527 --> 00:12:45,953
Speaker 1: It wasn't really shaking It was just.

171
00:12:46,436 --> 00:12:48,610
Speaker 1: obviously I would not be able to turn it quickly.

172
00:12:49,891 --> 00:12:58,572
Speaker 1: The real issue was that I only kept it at that speed for about five minutes because the whole time I'm thinking if There's a cop totally fucked if there's a cop I'm totally fucked.

173
00:12:58,914 --> 00:12:59,175
Speaker 1: didn't.

174
00:12:59,215 --> 00:13:03,250
Speaker 1: time felt like it slowed down because I was so worried about there being a cop.

175
00:13:03,431 --> 00:13:04,116
Speaker 1: I know right.

176
00:13:04,237 --> 00:13:06,170
Speaker 1: the thing is there were no other cars on the road.

177
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:15,040
Speaker 1: My only hope was that relativistic effects would create a situation whereby I could slow the car down before The cop got the radar on me.

178
00:13:15,643 --> 00:13:16,789
Speaker 0: a good chance of that.

179
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,758
Speaker 1: Either that or maybe because there was no trees.

180
00:13:20,838 --> 00:13:22,803
Speaker 1: It was an open plane in the middle of Canada.

181
00:13:23,084 --> 00:13:23,666
Speaker 1: No trees.

182
00:13:24,027 --> 00:13:25,090
Speaker 1: No other cars.

183
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:33,297
Speaker 1: Theoretically a cop just sitting there would have no frame of reference and couldn't figure out how fast I was going Unless he had the radar pointed.

184
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:34,826
Speaker 1: I doubt he had the radar pointed.

185
00:13:34,846 --> 00:13:35,630
Speaker 1: cuz there's no one on the road.

186
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,019
Speaker 1: You know what never saw a cop the whole time.

187
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,690
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah, he could also gotten you with a laser.

188
00:13:41,591 --> 00:13:43,663
Speaker 1: Yeah, he could have but he would have had to have the laser ready.

189
00:13:43,944 --> 00:13:44,206
Speaker 1: Yeah.

190
00:13:44,326 --> 00:13:46,130
Speaker 0: Yeah pretty much All right.

191
00:13:46,974 --> 00:13:47,516
Speaker 0: What's your news?

192
00:13:48,300 --> 00:14:13,952
Speaker 1: So a long time ago like eight years ago I read this article about how muscle tone in terms of you know, how good your muscles look Has a lot to do with the many many small movements you make constantly and that people who fidget There is overwhelming evidence that people who fidget are thinner have more muscle tone are stronger and are generally healthier Despite the fact that you know they fidget.

193
00:14:14,012 --> 00:14:19,668
Speaker 1: and fidgeting is often very annoying when you see someone else doing it or when you're doing it yourself when you know, You shouldn't know.

194
00:14:20,513 --> 00:14:20,894
Speaker 1: Well up.

195
00:14:21,075 --> 00:14:35,217
Speaker 1: a bunch of new studies recently apparently have found fairly strong genetic links linking genetics and fidgeting and to they have further brought forth all this evidence that people who fidget are a lot thinner and very rarely become obese.

196
00:14:35,257 --> 00:14:37,489
Speaker 1: obese people rarely fidget mmm.

197
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:41,230
Speaker 1: and Because you know, you're constantly exercising all your muscles.

198
00:14:41,993 --> 00:14:45,345
Speaker 1: And I just point out that I fidget quite a bit and so does Scott.

199
00:14:45,606 --> 00:14:46,590
Speaker 0: I fidget all the time.

200
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,015
Speaker 0: That's how come I'm not fat.

201
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:52,049
Speaker 0: Even though I lead a sedentary lifestyle which and don't exercise.

202
00:14:52,751 --> 00:14:56,825
Speaker 1: Yeah, see we have this funny running gag about the sedentary lifestyle with Scott.

203
00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:59,169
Speaker 1: I bring it up at all opportunity.

204
00:15:00,091 --> 00:15:15,077
Speaker 1: Scott could be sitting there like out of the blue, you know, we're in a car and he'd be like, ah I don't know my leg fell asleep or Man my legs a little stiff cuz you know We're in the road car for like eight hours and I'd immediately say well if you probably wouldn't have that problem If you didn't lead a sedentary lifestyle,

205
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:16,342
Speaker 0: yeah, that's what he does.

206
00:15:16,362 --> 00:15:17,146
Speaker 0: That's what I do.

207
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,150
Speaker 1: That's my shtick.

208
00:15:18,511 --> 00:15:21,301
Speaker 1: It's a very annoying shtick and I found this article interesting.

209
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:25,221
Speaker 0: compared to most people who do lead sedentary lifestyles I'm not so sedentary.

210
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:26,853
Speaker 1: Well because you fidget Well, I mean.

211
00:15:26,873 --> 00:15:30,870
Speaker 0: but like think about the people who sit on a couch and watch TV for like six hours a day.

212
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:36,170
Speaker 1: No while you lead a sedentary physical lifestyle, you're basically in the jet-set of the internet.

213
00:15:36,972 --> 00:15:38,035
Speaker 1: So, I guess it evens out.

214
00:15:38,898 --> 00:15:42,950
Speaker 0: I'm not so sedentary around the relative scale of people in this country.

215
00:15:43,851 --> 00:15:44,153
Speaker 0: Yeah.

216
00:15:44,294 --> 00:15:45,382
Speaker 1: Yeah, I gotta give you that.

217
00:15:45,603 --> 00:15:50,959
Speaker 0: I gotta give you that I am moderate on the Activity you don't have.

218
00:15:50,979 --> 00:15:52,870
Speaker 1: it's like I own it as groove in the couch.

219
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:57,630
Speaker 0: It's like I don't exercise but I also don't sit down and not do anything.

220
00:15:57,752 --> 00:15:58,369
Speaker 0: Don't eat.

221
00:15:59,036 --> 00:16:11,970
Speaker 0: Like even if you look at my co-workers They sit there all day at work and only get up to go to the bathroom once and like for lunch I have to get up like every like half hour and move around and tell these other people just sit there all day.

222
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,297
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh god, I couldn't stand that.

223
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:24,350
Speaker 1: even at IBM a lot of times It'd be like 3 45 on a Wednesday and I just feel like yeah And I just get up and wander a mile or two over to one of the other buildings I'd never been into and just walk around it for 10 minutes.

224
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:24,887
Speaker 1: Yeah

225
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:28,865
Speaker 0: I just get up and like stretch next to my chair and then do a little dance and one

226
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:39,645
Speaker 1: time I got lost I wandered Over into a part of the fab I'd never been in before and it was way way far away from where I should have been and I totally got lost for like A half hour and I couldn't find my way out of the building.

227
00:16:39,786 --> 00:16:40,189
Speaker 0: Good job.

228
00:16:40,891 --> 00:16:42,900
Speaker 1: Luckily, I got back and no one even noticed I'd left.

229
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,150
Speaker 0: so yeah shows how important your job is.

230
00:16:45,512 --> 00:16:46,620
Speaker 1: Well, it was my job.

231
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:56,767
Speaker 1: there was mostly figure out solutions to problems Like we have a problem with X and I just my job was if I come up with the solution implement it.

232
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,772
Speaker 1: Otherwise Generally be idle Mm-hmm.

233
00:17:00,595 --> 00:17:01,919
Speaker 0: Yeah, we really need to.

234
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:03,524
Speaker 0: I don't know this.

235
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:04,547
Speaker 0: It's still a big problem.

236
00:17:04,567 --> 00:17:06,113
Speaker 0: the idleness at work There should never be.

237
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:06,856
Speaker 0: I don't this at work.

238
00:17:06,896 --> 00:17:07,419
Speaker 0: It should be either.

239
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,531
Speaker 0: I'm at work working or I can go home Huh?

240
00:17:10,852 --> 00:17:14,463
Speaker 1: I just remember when I worked at the Ritz the worst job I ever had.

241
00:17:14,864 --> 00:17:16,829
Speaker 1: Well, maybe the second worst job I ever had?

242
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:17,271
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

243
00:17:17,914 --> 00:17:18,195
Speaker 1: I don't know.

244
00:17:18,215 --> 00:17:19,140
Speaker 1: That's a really tough call.

245
00:17:19,803 --> 00:17:21,148
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's the worst job I ever had.

246
00:17:22,271 --> 00:17:29,978
Speaker 1: I mitigated that somewhat by being the absolute best pizza chef they ever had and then deciding that it was better for me to be The absolute worst pizza chef they'd ever had.

247
00:17:29,998 --> 00:17:55,561
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got stories about that place But uh any time I was idle they'd walk over and just look at me and say in all seriousness if you got time to lean you got time to clean and I would look at the filth that had been accumulated over the past several decades on the floor where I was standing and I would straighten up and stop leaning and They would look at me and realize that I had just punned them.

248
00:17:55,581 --> 00:17:57,690
Speaker 1: Yeah and just walk away shaking their head.

249
00:17:58,531 --> 00:18:04,609
Speaker 1: But then they come back over with a mop anyway, but at least I had that tiny victory and I quit not too long after.

250
00:18:05,078 --> 00:18:13,709
Speaker 1: Yep things of the day.

251
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:17,049
Speaker 1: So if I what's your favorite robots got?

252
00:18:18,671 --> 00:18:24,310
Speaker 1: Of all robot robots now not cyborgs not power suits not giant robots.

253
00:18:24,611 --> 00:18:30,490
Speaker 1: I'm talking just straight-up robot my real robots any robot it could be from a cartoon.

254
00:18:30,972 --> 00:18:32,359
Speaker 1: Perhaps I don't know.

255
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:35,354
Speaker 0: the most powerful robot is Voltron But I.

256
00:18:35,394 --> 00:18:37,805
Speaker 1: but Voltron is nothing without the people who pilot him.

257
00:18:38,227 --> 00:18:38,970
Speaker 0: That's not the point.

258
00:18:42,793 --> 00:18:45,670
Speaker 1: I think I would have to go with hedonism by hard to pick one robot.

259
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:52,466
Speaker 0: You're gonna pick hedonism, but hedonism bod has provided more enjoyment in my life than any other robot This is about isn't even as good as bender?

260
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:58,577
Speaker 1: How delicious Yeah, plus he doesn't.

261
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,429
Speaker 1: mod just comes up in casual conversation all the time lately.

262
00:19:02,135 --> 00:19:03,629
Speaker 0: Mostly cuz you're playing that game.

263
00:19:03,711 --> 00:19:06,505
Speaker 1: Yeah We got to buy that game and then we got to review it on the show.

264
00:19:06,526 --> 00:19:14,010
Speaker 0: cuz good guy Talk about it on the show And it's like a part of a cop a whole episode about all the games we played it gaming for hope or whatever?

265
00:19:14,251 --> 00:19:14,712
Speaker 1: I think so.

266
00:19:15,174 --> 00:19:20,130
Speaker 1: But anyway, my thing of the day here is the Hubo FX one chair BOTS.

267
00:19:20,852 --> 00:19:27,653
Speaker 1: I am now one step closer to being able to should I desire it live like hedonism bot Uh-huh.

268
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:29,861
Speaker 1: It's basically just a walking chair.

269
00:19:29,881 --> 00:19:32,450
Speaker 1: It's it's kind of like I don't know how to describe it.

270
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,418
Speaker 1: Just look at a picture of it.

271
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:38,702
Speaker 1: I Guess it'd be theoretically useful if you were handicapped and you wanted to.

272
00:19:38,722 --> 00:19:41,230
Speaker 1: I don't know climb mountains or go over rough terrain.

273
00:19:42,171 --> 00:19:51,792
Speaker 1: I think it's neat and I couldn't find anything better and I wasn't just gonna use a clip from The Simpsons again Which you were about to do because it was quite a high quality Simpsons clip.

274
00:19:51,953 --> 00:19:54,640
Speaker 1: it was because I have indeed played that game before.

275
00:19:54,921 --> 00:19:58,150
Speaker 0: maybe we need a whole week of Simpsons clip thing of the day.

276
00:19:58,571 --> 00:20:01,520
Speaker 1: Oh, that's such a great cop-out, but too bad.

277
00:20:01,561 --> 00:20:03,447
Speaker 0: We already used some of the best ones.

278
00:20:03,467 --> 00:20:04,370
Speaker 0: That's fine.

279
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:05,638
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's plenty more.

280
00:20:05,718 --> 00:20:09,161
Speaker 0: there are plenty but they're not, you know It's like you want to have them if you're gonna do it.

281
00:20:09,181 --> 00:20:10,269
Speaker 0: You want to the best ones?

282
00:20:11,113 --> 00:20:12,122
Speaker 0: You can't go with like these.

283
00:20:12,324 --> 00:20:14,898
Speaker 1: weak one Alright anyway, so what do you got?

284
00:20:15,441 --> 00:20:16,225
Speaker 0: What do I have?

285
00:20:16,265 --> 00:20:17,150
Speaker 0: That is a good question.

286
00:20:17,691 --> 00:20:26,017
Speaker 0: Well, you may remember that the there's a guy named Penn Jillette, you know that magician Atheist guys big and fat.

287
00:20:26,057 --> 00:20:28,026
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's a funny super libertarian.

288
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:29,271
Speaker 0: Yeah that guy He's.

289
00:20:29,492 --> 00:20:32,140
Speaker 1: he's really smart, but he's also really dumb.

290
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:36,095
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's this interesting dichotomy where it's like I'm with you I'm with you.

291
00:20:36,115 --> 00:20:36,800
Speaker 1: I'm with you.

292
00:20:37,163 --> 00:20:37,970
Speaker 1: God that was stupid.

293
00:20:38,251 --> 00:20:40,941
Speaker 1: But then he gets points because whenever he says something stupid he knows.

294
00:20:41,061 --> 00:20:43,490
Speaker 1: and then he says but I'm just a big stupid fat guy.

295
00:20:44,393 --> 00:20:45,609
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that's just his.

296
00:20:47,572 --> 00:20:52,350
Speaker 0: You know, it's like he's just learned these defenses like he thinks he's right but he'll just say I'm a big stupid fat guy.

297
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:52,933
Speaker 0: What do I know?

298
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:56,130
Speaker 1: We know someone else who used to be like that a lot of own ocean a name.

299
00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:02,350
Speaker 0: But but anyway, he used to have this podcast that eventually it was also an actual radio show.

300
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:05,764
Speaker 0: They happened to podcast it but the pops cast was more popular than the radio show.

301
00:21:05,924 --> 00:21:06,165
Speaker 1: Yep.

302
00:21:06,205 --> 00:21:07,189
Speaker 1: So eventually they ended it.

303
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:10,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, eventually they ended it for various reasons and whatever.

304
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:17,330
Speaker 0: but Basically It was a time on the show where he told a story about a patent.

305
00:21:17,571 --> 00:21:19,825
Speaker 0: He had a real patent a real patent.

306
00:21:19,865 --> 00:21:20,610
Speaker 0: He has a patent.

307
00:21:20,711 --> 00:21:29,283
Speaker 0: So, you know, I figured oh, it's probably for some like, you know Device like a trick device he needs for a magic trick that he invented or something like that.

308
00:21:30,106 --> 00:21:31,189
Speaker 0: No, no, it's nothing like that.

309
00:21:32,432 --> 00:21:35,630
Speaker 0: The thing he has a patent on is the Jill jet.

310
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:40,150
Speaker 0: That's what he called it because his name is Penn Jill et and this thing is a jet of water.

311
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,316
Speaker 0: So he called it the Jill jet.

312
00:21:41,697 --> 00:21:45,112
Speaker 1: the story he told of how we came up with it was pretty funny I gotta say.

313
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:58,378
Speaker 0: basically what it is is you have a like a hot tub or a bathtub or something like that and You know you arrange that the tub is shaped in such a way that you can sit on it and there was a hole with a jet of water coming out of it.

314
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:05,250
Speaker 0: and if you're a woman and you sit on the seat a Jet of water will pleasure you and that is the Jill jet.

315
00:22:05,872 --> 00:22:12,156
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically from what I get the general gist of it where he came up with it was you know People sitting around in a hot tub.

316
00:22:12,818 --> 00:22:15,670
Speaker 1: They always think about why don't I edge up to that thing?

317
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:20,189
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then he realized why don't I just put him in convenient places to do that?

318
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,334
Speaker 1: Yep, of course.

319
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:23,103
Speaker 1: He's also a big pervert which really helped.

320
00:22:23,183 --> 00:22:24,510
Speaker 1: I think yeah, but anyway.

321
00:22:25,591 --> 00:22:31,341
Speaker 0: So I you know, Google has had this patent search for quite a while now And I just never actually bothered to go look at it.

322
00:22:31,381 --> 00:22:35,949
Speaker 0: But for some reason this week I just ended up there randomly at some point and I said, huh?

323
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:37,976
Speaker 0: What patent should I search for?

324
00:22:38,037 --> 00:22:40,690
Speaker 0: so I searched for like fire to see if anyone patented fire?

325
00:22:41,431 --> 00:22:55,284
Speaker 0: Then I searched like the wheel to see if anyone to patented the wheel and I learned that Every freaking different design for a tire rim like on a car has been patented Like every possible shape you can come up with has been patented by Bridgestone.

326
00:22:55,304 --> 00:22:58,883
Speaker 1: I just came up with a new one Yep full of spikes.

327
00:22:59,467 --> 00:23:03,543
Speaker 0: Yep Anyway, so then I said hey, why don't I search for the Jill jet?

328
00:23:04,286 --> 00:23:06,716
Speaker 0: and I found it It is actually not.

329
00:23:07,378 --> 00:23:08,161
Speaker 0: it is not listed.

330
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:12,207
Speaker 0: as the Jill jet is listed as the hydro therapeutic stimulator.

331
00:23:12,914 --> 00:23:14,083
Speaker 1: See Scott sends me this.

332
00:23:14,104 --> 00:23:14,910
Speaker 1: he doesn't say what it is.

333
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:20,410
Speaker 1: So I look at the patent and at first I think oh, is it some BS like made-up hydrotherapy?

334
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,518
Speaker 1: Or is it some real hydrotherapy?

335
00:23:22,538 --> 00:23:23,140
Speaker 1: or what is this?

336
00:23:23,582 --> 00:23:24,687
Speaker 1: And he said just keep looking at it.

337
00:23:24,727 --> 00:23:25,309
Speaker 1: I keep looking at it.

338
00:23:25,329 --> 00:23:30,695
Speaker 0: then Ben Gillette Yeah, it's it's a let's see.

339
00:23:30,735 --> 00:23:36,753
Speaker 0: The filing date was January 9th, 1998 and it was issued in July of 1999.

340
00:23:36,753 --> 00:23:38,123
Speaker 0: It's patent number five nine two.

341
00:23:38,204 --> 00:23:38,829
Speaker 0: Oh nine, two, three.

342
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:43,390
Speaker 1: So, uh, wait a minute by god, is that her ratio?

343
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:49,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, it wasn't the best segue but I had to go with it even though I don't think they actually say those exact words.

344
00:23:50,591 --> 00:23:53,887
Speaker 1: Yeah, kind of like a people always misquote Shakespeare and just add lies don't ever said.

345
00:23:53,907 --> 00:23:56,407
Speaker 1: but anyway Horatio hornblower.

346
00:23:57,452 --> 00:23:59,710
Speaker 0: A lot of people have no idea what the hell Horatio hornblower.

347
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:04,228
Speaker 1: However, awesome people do and if you want to be awesome, you should check Horatio hornblower out.

348
00:24:04,589 --> 00:24:17,059
Speaker 0: Well Horatio hornblower is a fictional character created by cs forester for a series of novels And it's based on a real life person named Horatio.

349
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:17,540
Speaker 1: Nelson.

350
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:33,514
Speaker 0: Yes now now when we say based on we mean in the loosest sense Yeah, I mean what do they have in common, let's see awesome in the british navy Awesome named Horatio named Horatio Granted the.

351
00:24:33,554 --> 00:24:43,470
Speaker 1: the one important difference is that Horatio hornblower in the novels actually ends up Piloting the ship that carries Horatio Nelson's body in his funeral.

352
00:24:44,631 --> 00:24:51,130
Speaker 1: Uh, which is great because he gets assigned this honor and he's walking out and he realizes this isn't an honor.

353
00:24:51,391 --> 00:25:00,466
Speaker 1: This is crap because if I do the job perfectly no one's gonna care because of course I did the job perfectly But if anything goes wrong, i'm totally fucked because I just lost Horatio.

354
00:25:00,527 --> 00:25:01,310
Speaker 1: Nelson's body.

355
00:25:02,071 --> 00:25:04,563
Speaker 1: There's nothing to gain from this and everything to lose.

356
00:25:04,764 --> 00:25:05,789
Speaker 1: this totally blows.

357
00:25:06,537 --> 00:25:07,467
Speaker 0: Uh, that's a good one.

358
00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:10,849
Speaker 1: Anyway, now scott hasn't actually read the books.

359
00:25:11,431 --> 00:25:18,021
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have but scott has seen the shows as if I yes what they did is, uh, let's see When did they actually do that?

360
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,297
Speaker 1: It doesn't really matter I don't want to get into who directed it or whatever.

361
00:25:21,418 --> 00:25:39,137
Speaker 0: No, no, but I just wanted to say what year they came out with the uh in 1998 through uh itv and a and e. Uh teamed up and made a mini series of television shows even though they're more like movies Yeah, they're all like two hours long.

362
00:25:39,257 --> 00:25:49,269
Speaker 0: Yeah of Horatio hornblower stories and they started out with like one set of them of like four movies and then they came out with like a couple more and A few more and then they were done.

363
00:25:49,812 --> 00:25:54,170
Speaker 1: So i'm going to tell you what Horatio hornblower is about and then we're going to tell you what it's really about.

364
00:25:54,611 --> 00:26:01,308
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the books by cs forester are in my opinion some of the greatest nautical fiction written in english ever.

365
00:26:01,508 --> 00:26:05,750
Speaker 1: Well, uh, Now here are my reasons why i'm a huge fan of cs forester.

366
00:26:06,272 --> 00:26:09,102
Speaker 1: I put him second only to damas in terms of my writing.

367
00:26:09,142 --> 00:26:22,410
Speaker 1: I like and maybe uh, I'm not gonna get into that now They are written in a very exacting style in that he did his research and A lot of it is very accurate or at least plausible.

368
00:26:23,072 --> 00:26:27,184
Speaker 1: It gives you a good sense of what being in the british navy was actually like.

369
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:35,550
Speaker 1: and while it is romanticized It is romanticized in a fairly realistic way because it romanticizes a lot of things that are not terribly romantic.

370
00:26:36,771 --> 00:26:56,269
Speaker 1: Now aside from that the writing style He had this gift of where and I think some famous writing critic said something similar, but when you read these books He uses all the jargon of nautical the world the nautical world All the things that you don't know what these things are the mizzen mask the top sales all these things

371
00:26:56,872 --> 00:26:57,897
Speaker 0: Some of the things are

372
00:26:57,917 --> 00:27:00,469
Speaker 1: coming into elise shore and all this stuff.

373
00:27:01,913 --> 00:27:03,769
Speaker 1: And he never explains whenever it is ever.

374
00:27:04,513 --> 00:27:07,826
Speaker 1: And it's kind of like what the show's like er did where all the jargons there and all.

375
00:27:07,927 --> 00:27:13,210
Speaker 1: but unlike that All the jargon is used properly or at least 90 percent properly.

376
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:27,416
Speaker 1: And while you read it, you really feel at the end of any given book or after like any particular maneuver Like, you know exactly what's going on and you know exactly what what happened, you know, what was going on, you know You could be a sea captain.

377
00:27:27,456 --> 00:27:28,058
Speaker 1: You know how to.

378
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,103
Speaker 1: I could deal with that.

379
00:27:29,465 --> 00:27:31,619
Speaker 1: Obviously the storm came in So I pulled in the top.

380
00:27:31,659 --> 00:27:32,588
Speaker 1: souls not heave too.

381
00:27:33,313 --> 00:27:37,756
Speaker 1: But then you think about it and you realize that you have no fucking idea What actually happened.

382
00:27:37,977 --> 00:27:41,409
Speaker 1: your brain just tricked you into thinking you did because of the way he wrote it.

383
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:42,673
Speaker 1: yeah, and it's.

384
00:27:42,754 --> 00:27:49,116
Speaker 1: and he makes scenes where they're taking a bunch of barrels of beef and Lugging them onto the ship.

385
00:27:49,557 --> 00:27:52,287
Speaker 1: be really dramatic and really on the edge of your seat.

386
00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:54,977
Speaker 1: Oh shit They're gonna drop it heave heave.

387
00:27:55,339 --> 00:27:56,142
Speaker 1: Oh, we got it.

388
00:27:56,503 --> 00:27:58,190
Speaker 1: Uh, and it it's hard to explain.

389
00:27:58,231 --> 00:27:59,190
Speaker 1: You just got to read these books.

390
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:00,755
Speaker 0: The thing is the stories.

391
00:28:01,035 --> 00:28:12,450
Speaker 0: while they're well written and exciting adventure stories with lots of drama and action And awesomeness They're not really deep or meaningful or no literary.

392
00:28:12,651 --> 00:28:16,770
Speaker 1: They're a lot like the james bond books in that only in the water.

393
00:28:17,051 --> 00:28:18,678
Speaker 1: Yeah, and a little bit better.

394
00:28:18,719 --> 00:28:25,369
Speaker 1: I would say with cannons and honestly Here's the plot of every horatio hornblower book generally.

395
00:28:26,032 --> 00:28:27,497
Speaker 1: Horatio was on the land.

396
00:28:27,778 --> 00:28:29,163
Speaker 1: The land is boring and sad.

397
00:28:29,504 --> 00:28:31,330
Speaker 1: london is stifling and everything sucks.

398
00:28:31,611 --> 00:28:36,690
Speaker 1: He may or may not have a wife or a lover but he's kind of sick of her and wishes he was in the ocean.

399
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,115
Speaker 1: Hooray, there's war now.

400
00:28:39,136 --> 00:28:39,878
Speaker 1: He's in the ocean.

401
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:40,741
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

402
00:28:40,921 --> 00:28:42,667
Speaker 1: He has to get everything together and it sucks.

403
00:28:42,868 --> 00:28:43,590
Speaker 1: his crew sucks.

404
00:28:43,751 --> 00:28:46,523
Speaker 1: He's seasick through the trials and tribulations of sea.

405
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:47,990
Speaker 1: the crew becomes awesome.

406
00:28:48,511 --> 00:28:49,876
Speaker 1: Then he meets a woman.

407
00:28:50,317 --> 00:28:52,604
Speaker 1: he cheats on whoever he was with on the land.

408
00:28:52,684 --> 00:28:54,570
Speaker 1: if there was someone with this woman.

409
00:28:55,410 --> 00:29:00,970
Speaker 1: This woman then either dies or the woman back on the shore dies so he can be with whichever woman he wanted.

410
00:29:01,511 --> 00:29:03,678
Speaker 1: In the course of this he does something awesome.

411
00:29:03,939 --> 00:29:08,268
Speaker 1: his best friend dies and he ends up at the end of the book Wishing he was back at sea.

412
00:29:09,311 --> 00:29:11,884
Speaker 0: But of course you say he's like the hero of the entire british nation.

413
00:29:11,924 --> 00:29:21,110
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah the whole time The end of every book is like he's sailing back and he's like, oh crap They're gonna court-martial me because I suck and everything about me sucks and I totally screwed this up.

414
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:28,826
Speaker 1: And then they make him a knight or the order of the bath or they give him a gigantic pile of money Or they commend him or whatever and all his fears are put to rest.

415
00:29:28,846 --> 00:29:29,409
Speaker 1: and that's the end.

416
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:31,196
Speaker 1: They're total formulas.

417
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:32,120
Speaker 1: every book's the same.

418
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:35,773
Speaker 1: if you unless you really like this stuff just read one of them It doesn't matter which one.

419
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:44,289
Speaker 1: Yeah, just watch the freaking movies because that's all I see now the books aside Here's what he ratio is really about because you watch these shows.

420
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:52,190
Speaker 1: basically Horatio hornblower is a show where the good guys look like good guys and they always win.

421
00:29:52,651 --> 00:29:54,638
Speaker 1: The bad guys look like bad guys.

422
00:29:54,699 --> 00:29:54,960
Speaker 1: Yep.

423
00:29:55,020 --> 00:30:01,124
Speaker 0: The bad guys are all french and spanish and the good guys are all english Yep, or uh simpson or simon or whatever his name was.

424
00:30:01,386 --> 00:30:12,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, he was british but yeah, it's like every episode of the tv show is like there's one guy who's like You know the the kind of annoying guy who's he ratio has to go around with who's not?

425
00:30:12,872 --> 00:30:15,189
Speaker 0: You know good and everyone else is good and yep.

426
00:30:15,571 --> 00:30:22,630
Speaker 1: And then there's the bad guy and it's like the guy appears bad music bad guy doing bad things.

427
00:30:22,952 --> 00:30:28,199
Speaker 0: Oh, no, look he's doing bad things but he can't do anything about the guy until the very end of the episode.

428
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:34,321
Speaker 1: when suddenly everything comes together he kicks him ass and Everyone bad gets what's coming to them.

429
00:30:34,622 --> 00:30:38,840
Speaker 1: every time you dislike a character Everything you want to happen to them happens to them.

430
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,787
Speaker 0: No more than what you want to happen.

431
00:30:40,928 --> 00:30:42,555
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I think the I don't.

432
00:30:42,596 --> 00:30:49,310
Speaker 1: we're not ruining anything because he's got to watch these but Watch the first episode of Horatio, which I believe is called the duel.

433
00:30:49,693 --> 00:30:51,690
Speaker 1: They might have named it something else depending on the release.

434
00:30:51,792 --> 00:30:53,398
Speaker 1: It's the first one Mr.

435
00:30:53,438 --> 00:30:58,009
Speaker 1: Midshipman hornblower And not only does the bad guy gets what get what's coming to him?

436
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:12,530
Speaker 1: But the bad guy leaves the plot for like an hour and you think he's won and then the bad guy's back You're like, oh shit And then the bad guy loses in like the most double epic awesome way you could ever imagine.

437
00:31:13,531 --> 00:31:16,083
Speaker 0: I think the other great thing about it is in Horatio.

438
00:31:16,103 --> 00:31:18,053
Speaker 0: There's all sorts of characters It's like.

439
00:31:18,093 --> 00:31:22,417
Speaker 0: as for as many characters that are the bad guy that you hate This character is that is just awesome.

440
00:31:22,699 --> 00:31:32,169
Speaker 1: Oh captain peleu if I were ever to be gay for a man it would be captain peleu because he's just so badass and heroic and he always knows what to do.

441
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:35,046
Speaker 0: and He does it and he gets the shit done.

442
00:31:35,066 --> 00:31:38,923
Speaker 0: the thing He's the captain and you have to move the boat and there's no wind.

443
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:46,270
Speaker 1: so he gets in a little boat and he rose And it's like oh, yeah And the best part is you always keep coming back to him because that's the ship Horatio's on.

444
00:31:46,754 --> 00:31:54,010
Speaker 1: But then every time Horatio is on his own It's always trouble because peleu's not there and you always feel like oh if peleu were here.

445
00:31:54,591 --> 00:32:05,694
Speaker 1: But then horatio starts becoming more and more awesome and peleu realizes this and realizes that this kid's gonna be me someday and he will someday because well There wouldn't be another episode.

446
00:32:05,714 --> 00:32:21,650
Speaker 1: if he didn't what really helps is that aside from being the baddest ass Motherfucker in the history of the world with the possible exception of washington Washington peleu Is the most sarcastic motherfucker in the history of the world.

447
00:32:22,131 --> 00:32:24,299
Speaker 0: it's it peleu like he always.

448
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:27,993
Speaker 0: I can't even do the peleu humor because it's just so Amazing.

449
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:35,770
Speaker 0: what he does is he'll he'll be like you'll come back on the boat Horatio will come back on the boat and peleu will be like, oh you screwed up there blah blah blah.

450
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,214
Speaker 0: Why didn't you follow the orders?

451
00:32:37,254 --> 00:32:45,256
Speaker 0: blah blah blah and horatio would be like, uh, something something excuse something and peleu You'll be like, oh, oh, is that right?

452
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:48,386
Speaker 0: You know you think uh, you know, you think this and this.

453
00:32:48,506 --> 00:32:50,334
Speaker 1: you think you're smarter than The admiralty.

454
00:32:50,555 --> 00:32:52,987
Speaker 1: you think you know what the best thing to do with that ship was.

455
00:32:53,087 --> 00:32:53,570
Speaker 0: well, you know what?

456
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:55,282
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you don't.

457
00:32:55,847 --> 00:32:58,561
Speaker 0: you Are 10 times as smarter than you thought you were.

458
00:32:58,582 --> 00:33:00,370
Speaker 0: and then it'll be like you've been promoted.

459
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:06,687
Speaker 1: And the guy it's this the sarcasm is so powerful that it hits you like a brick.

460
00:33:06,807 --> 00:33:07,830
Speaker 1: It's fantastic.

461
00:33:08,631 --> 00:33:13,430
Speaker 0: It's sort of like if rim came up and i'd be like, oh rim you think uh, you wouldn't ten dollars, huh?

462
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:14,775
Speaker 0: You think you won ten dollars?

463
00:33:14,815 --> 00:33:16,202
Speaker 0: Yeah, you didn't win ten dollars.

464
00:33:16,403 --> 00:33:17,970
Speaker 0: You won a hundred dollars you piece of shit.

465
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:19,587
Speaker 0: And then it's it's like what?

466
00:33:21,071 --> 00:33:32,941
Speaker 1: He says it like he's scolding you but it's it's like It's like you bastard you made lieutenant and by the reverse token when he's actually scolding someone It's all that but without the sarcasm at the end.

467
00:33:33,122 --> 00:33:37,740
Speaker 0: You're like, oh that really hurt And it's hard to tell if he's about to turn around or not.

468
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,248
Speaker 0: plus when he actually scold someone it's it's pretty much If you're talking to him.

469
00:33:42,832 --> 00:33:51,027
Speaker 0: You basically hear the same thing out of his mouth no matter what and then at the end You're either gonna get like a sack full of money or whipped.

470
00:33:52,431 --> 00:33:55,906
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you don't know which one there's no way to tell until he's done talking.

471
00:33:56,107 --> 00:34:06,802
Speaker 1: now aside from him All the officers on the ship racers on for the early episodes the indefatigable aren't also Just sarcastic and snippy and hilarious.

472
00:34:07,183 --> 00:34:15,530
Speaker 1: and while this is a very serious show There is a I guess it's a very it's a very british show and then there's so much humor constantly.

473
00:34:15,771 --> 00:34:17,498
Speaker 1: It's you know, epic epic epic.

474
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,623
Speaker 1: Oh my god a fight.

475
00:34:18,925 --> 00:34:28,083
Speaker 1: epic epic epic Little quips little bips when a ballsy comes back in the wrong war at the end with all those guns in his belt on the horse In the french uniform.

476
00:34:28,184 --> 00:34:30,774
Speaker 1: Yeah That's a good part.

477
00:34:30,855 --> 00:34:31,136
Speaker 1: you're like.

478
00:34:31,317 --> 00:34:32,523
Speaker 1: how's that guy gonna get out of it?

479
00:34:32,844 --> 00:34:33,989
Speaker 1: the whole army's dead.

480
00:34:34,391 --> 00:34:38,547
Speaker 1: He's the only one left and then he comes riding over with the guns like i'm awesome.

481
00:34:38,568 --> 00:34:39,009
Speaker 1: Look at me.

482
00:34:39,233 --> 00:34:44,034
Speaker 0: well I think they also do that to show you that there's a bunch of characters on this boat and For a lot.

483
00:34:44,074 --> 00:34:46,690
Speaker 0: horatio is not like the admiral of the whole navy right away.

484
00:34:46,871 --> 00:34:48,558
Speaker 1: No, he's just like a crap midshipman.

485
00:34:48,578 --> 00:34:50,184
Speaker 0: He's not even the captain of the boat yet.

486
00:34:50,225 --> 00:34:51,530
Speaker 0: No, he's not even a lieutenant.

487
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,056
Speaker 1: He's acting lieutenant.

488
00:34:53,277 --> 00:34:56,650
Speaker 1: He's only acting lieutenant because everyone above him got killed.

489
00:34:56,791 --> 00:35:04,789
Speaker 0: Yeah, so all they have to show you Somehow that the people that are above horatio are above him because they're better than he is right now.

490
00:35:05,131 --> 00:35:10,551
Speaker 0: yeah, so, you know captain pelli of course always has an opportunity to be awesome, but like Mr.

491
00:35:10,591 --> 00:35:17,790
Speaker 0: Bowles doesn't have an opportunity to be awesome that often so in one episode He's got to be more awesome if he's a higher rank than horatio.

492
00:35:17,931 --> 00:35:21,426
Speaker 0: So they give him a chance to be awesome like one in one episode and sure enough.

493
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:22,330
Speaker 0: He's awesome.

494
00:35:22,631 --> 00:35:27,130
Speaker 0: You don't get to be a higher rank than horatio and also be worse than him or else you die.

495
00:35:27,412 --> 00:35:28,682
Speaker 0: And then horatio takes a spot.

496
00:35:29,024 --> 00:35:32,980
Speaker 1: See horatio Does what like sanctuary does for me with yakuza.

497
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,930
Speaker 1: where if if being in the navy?

498
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:39,850
Speaker 1: Back then was like being horatio hornblower or captain pelew.

499
00:35:40,971 --> 00:35:41,954
Speaker 1: That's the best life.

500
00:35:42,055 --> 00:35:43,941
Speaker 1: I would live that life in a second too bad.

501
00:35:43,961 --> 00:35:44,885
Speaker 0: That's not what it was like.

502
00:35:44,925 --> 00:35:46,450
Speaker 0: No, there's a lot of rat eating.

503
00:35:46,651 --> 00:35:51,290
Speaker 1: It's a little more like the books because the books are a lot less funny and a lot more.

504
00:35:51,932 --> 00:35:53,738
Speaker 1: Wow, a lot of people just died.

505
00:35:53,758 --> 00:35:56,427
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of people just died.

506
00:35:56,528 --> 00:35:58,804
Speaker 1: But here it's like A lot of people just died.

507
00:35:58,825 --> 00:35:59,390
Speaker 1: That was awesome.

508
00:35:59,812 --> 00:36:12,081
Speaker 1: When the uh, it's like if someone with a name does dies It's it's no big deal when lord watch his name takes his marines around the back and kills all the french and he's just so like lackadaisical about.

509
00:36:12,101 --> 00:36:17,507
Speaker 1: he's just like Fire patoom patoom fire patoom patoom.

510
00:36:18,932 --> 00:36:21,570
Speaker 0: He's a british like army lord, right?

511
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:34,777
Speaker 0: He's got like a whole bunch of guys with rifles and muskets and things and he's on a horse and he's just so bored all the time, but then he's confident because he's just so Badass, but he's also his ass.

512
00:36:34,877 --> 00:36:38,167
Speaker 1: His marines are so much better than those french soldiers.

513
00:36:38,327 --> 00:36:39,170
Speaker 0: I know he's just like.

514
00:36:40,051 --> 00:36:44,147
Speaker 0: it's like if you had a bunch of navy seals and you had to kill like a bunch of 13 year olds.

515
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:48,610
Speaker 0: you just be like All right guys go get him move out in the humvee.

516
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,072
Speaker 0: Yeah, shoot him.

517
00:36:50,092 --> 00:36:51,898
Speaker 1: It's like what formation doesn't matter.

518
00:36:51,978 --> 00:36:53,383
Speaker 0: Just walk shoot him.

519
00:36:53,423 --> 00:36:54,787
Speaker 1: now shoot that guy.

520
00:36:54,807 --> 00:36:55,610
Speaker 0: Are we done yet?

521
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,757
Speaker 0: I think we killed them all.

522
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,449
Speaker 0: All right, let's pack it up.

523
00:36:58,469 --> 00:37:00,778
Speaker 1: guys Like they set you up in a normal crap show.

524
00:37:01,059 --> 00:37:05,578
Speaker 1: you meet this lord and Horatio has to work with this lord and he's like Oh, it's a lord.

525
00:37:05,638 --> 00:37:12,650
Speaker 1: He's only in the army because blah blah blah He's not doesn't know anything and you expect like the show to progress some guy who paid for a commission.

526
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:15,820
Speaker 0: He's not actually, you know a good army guy.

527
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:20,116
Speaker 0: He's just some guy who paid to get a title but instead He's cool.

528
00:37:20,618 --> 00:37:22,729
Speaker 1: And while he's a lord, he's still cool.

529
00:37:23,632 --> 00:37:30,839
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, the guy who's supposed to hate The french guy who's on their side Not only do they make him a really unlikable guy.

530
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:34,230
Speaker 1: They make him a billion times unlikable.

531
00:37:34,692 --> 00:37:40,616
Speaker 1: I mean he carries the guillotine with him and he's just cutting people's heads off and he's an asshole And he's stupid.

532
00:37:40,656 --> 00:37:42,122
Speaker 0: that's the french guy you're supposed to hate.

533
00:37:42,183 --> 00:37:53,824
Speaker 1: but there's the other french guy who's just dumb Who's not actually evil, but you like that guy because he tries so hard and at the end when he gets what's coming to him He basically gives the speech of I fucked it up.

534
00:37:54,286 --> 00:37:56,257
Speaker 1: I know it Get out of here.

535
00:37:56,297 --> 00:37:57,302
Speaker 1: So you don't die too.

536
00:37:57,624 --> 00:37:58,549
Speaker 1: This totally sucks.

537
00:37:59,771 --> 00:38:15,970
Speaker 0: well, he's one of those people where you know, there's a line between bravery and stupidity where it's like because bravery is all about Taking a risk and you know in order to accomplish something that otherwise would not be accomplished and succeeding.

538
00:38:16,911 --> 00:38:22,650
Speaker 0: If you take the risk, that's too large that there's no way you could have succeeded because it was such a dumb risk.

539
00:38:23,033 --> 00:38:30,207
Speaker 0: Like, you know if you take the 10 chance But then you know that your skills and abilities actually make it like a 50 chance.

540
00:38:30,248 --> 00:38:30,629
Speaker 0: That's heroism.

541
00:38:32,032 --> 00:38:39,185
Speaker 0: If you take the 1 chance and no amount of skill and ability can make it a 2 chance Oh, you mean like, uh buying a lottery ticket?

542
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:41,353
Speaker 0: Yes Exactly.

543
00:38:41,815 --> 00:38:45,570
Speaker 0: It's like if you want to go rescue someone from a burning building, right?

544
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:56,564
Speaker 0: And you know that you're really fast and you've got a suit on that will protect you somewhat from the fire and you know where the person is in the house and All right, you know, you've got you're probably you're going into a dangerous situation.

545
00:38:56,605 --> 00:38:57,407
Speaker 0: It's a huge risk.

546
00:38:57,448 --> 00:38:58,030
Speaker 0: You could die.

547
00:38:58,656 --> 00:39:04,330
Speaker 0: odds are against you but You know that if you try really hard you can do this and you do it and then you're hero.

548
00:39:04,992 --> 00:39:15,025
Speaker 0: If the house is like completely engulfed in flame and the people inside are on fire and there's like a gas tank sitting right there And you run in i'm gonna save them and then it explodes and you die.

549
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:16,250
Speaker 0: That was just stupid.

550
00:39:17,011 --> 00:39:19,340
Speaker 1: But the way it works in the ratio world is it.

551
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,384
Speaker 1: it's basically the brit.

552
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:24,277
Speaker 1: as far as this show is concerned Britain is a meritocracy.

553
00:39:24,638 --> 00:39:31,016
Speaker 1: the more badass you are the higher rank you are if you are a high rank But you never get to see the king You do in the books.

554
00:39:31,177 --> 00:39:34,574
Speaker 1: yeah, and it's really funny but it's like In this world.

555
00:39:34,755 --> 00:39:39,270
Speaker 0: following the rules of the british navy the king must be like an actual god.

556
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,202
Speaker 1: The king is just god walking around smiting people.

557
00:39:42,222 --> 00:39:45,114
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's kind of funny because the people you know They're in the british navy.

558
00:39:45,154 --> 00:39:46,077
Speaker 0: So they're always like god.

559
00:39:46,118 --> 00:39:47,865
Speaker 0: saved the king blah blah king.

560
00:39:47,925 --> 00:39:49,170
Speaker 0: Hooray the king.

561
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:50,920
Speaker 0: And they don't know the king.

562
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,509
Speaker 0: these people have no idea who the king is.

563
00:39:52,851 --> 00:39:53,896
Speaker 0: They like they know his name.

564
00:39:54,237 --> 00:39:55,483
Speaker 0: They might have seen a picture of him.

565
00:39:55,825 --> 00:39:56,608
Speaker 0: That's about it.

566
00:39:56,909 --> 00:39:58,036
Speaker 0: yet They're like in love with him.

567
00:39:58,478 --> 00:40:14,497
Speaker 1: now when we watch horatio hornblower Traditionally we would get a big group of people together with a bunch of food and drink and we'd sit down And as a group watch an episode And we would turn on the subtitles to fight despite the fact that it's in english Because otherwise we couldn't hear what they're saying.

568
00:40:14,618 --> 00:40:21,827
Speaker 1: amidst the yelling and screaming and cheering and booing It's kind of like shakespearean theater back in the shakespeare days.

569
00:40:21,887 --> 00:40:27,670
Speaker 1: for us It's this big loud riotous affair and that is my in my opinion the only way to watch horatio.

570
00:40:27,711 --> 00:40:36,307
Speaker 0: Yeah well I thought that you know like it was a show to watch with a lot of people and I still think it is a Show to watch with a lot of people and have fun so that when the crazy thing happens everyone goes.

571
00:40:36,528 --> 00:40:44,810
Speaker 0: Oh at the same time and it's a good experience but Watching the show with less people is that was actually still really good because it's such a good show.

572
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:45,372
Speaker 0: It holds up.

573
00:40:45,774 --> 00:40:50,696
Speaker 1: each one of these would stand on its own as a movie that I would just go see in the theater And pay my 15 bucks.

574
00:40:50,998 --> 00:40:53,172
Speaker 0: Oh and go see in the theater I would have.

575
00:40:53,312 --> 00:41:00,517
Speaker 0: it's definitely like the best a tv movie can be or direct a dvd movie can be So not a theater movie.

576
00:41:00,537 --> 00:41:01,522
Speaker 1: Well, they're regardless.

577
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:02,064
Speaker 1: They're awesome.

578
00:41:02,325 --> 00:41:02,988
Speaker 0: They are awesome.

579
00:41:03,229 --> 00:41:04,812
Speaker 1: now Getting into them.

580
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:09,083
Speaker 1: My advice is thus the first episode is probably the best one to watch.

581
00:41:09,344 --> 00:41:16,025
Speaker 1: However, I will point one thing out The first episode is different from all the rest in that It's a little slow.

582
00:41:16,065 --> 00:41:25,408
Speaker 1: in the beginning It seems like this is going to be a tedious long running boring Drama, like the first half of the movie is just so I would say boring.

583
00:41:25,528 --> 00:41:27,358
Speaker 1: almost Everything sucks.

584
00:41:27,459 --> 00:41:36,810
Speaker 1: It sucks to be here ratio And that is very purposeful because it builds you up and builds you up and by the end you're just.

585
00:41:37,651 --> 00:41:44,148
Speaker 0: Yeah, the second half of the first uh episode slash movie is what the rest of the entire show is like.

586
00:41:44,388 --> 00:41:46,695
Speaker 1: the payoff Of the first episode.

587
00:41:46,755 --> 00:41:49,764
Speaker 1: it's huge like and ludicrously huge.

588
00:41:49,885 --> 00:41:51,530
Speaker 1: it's in the last five minutes.

589
00:41:52,071 --> 00:41:59,532
Speaker 0: The last five minute payoff is so amazing that you'll it would be worth another half hour of boredom just to have that The.

590
00:42:00,416 --> 00:42:03,450
Speaker 1: I never would have expected what happened in a million years.

591
00:42:04,213 --> 00:42:05,841
Speaker 0: It happened and it's awesome.

592
00:42:05,922 --> 00:42:07,630
Speaker 1: I could watch that scene over and over again.

593
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:13,030
Speaker 1: It's just brilliant and then pretty much from that point forward the whole show is exactly like that all the time.

594
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:23,942
Speaker 1: So, yeah, so if you want one that's funnier as opposed to just like the payoff like that just to really get into it You can watch the fire ships or watch the wrong war.

595
00:42:24,023 --> 00:42:26,580
Speaker 1: the third one because that's the one that has a lot of the humor in it.

596
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:28,961
Speaker 0: Yep, I think that's the fourth one.

597
00:42:28,981 --> 00:42:30,330
Speaker 1: I think oh, yeah, it is the fourth one.

598
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:35,150
Speaker 1: The third one is the spanish prison, which is also really good because I really like the guy who runs the spanish prison.

599
00:42:35,372 --> 00:42:36,729
Speaker 0: Yeah, the don is a guy.

600
00:42:37,732 --> 00:42:49,656
Speaker 0: But yeah ratio horn blower is awesome old school british navy action Not very deep not very meaningful, but action adventure Comedy and awesomeness.

601
00:42:49,696 --> 00:42:53,307
Speaker 1: ahoy if you're not sure if you'd like this if you liked master and commander.

602
00:42:53,327 --> 00:42:55,594
Speaker 0: This is better Yeah, it is better.

603
00:42:55,655 --> 00:43:01,019
Speaker 1: And if you like this and you haven't seen master and commander see it Yeah, because it's good.

604
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,267
Speaker 0: It's not as good as ratio.

605
00:43:02,509 --> 00:43:07,408
Speaker 1: Yes However, it does have a very horatio like moment when when the guy does the thing to himself.

606
00:43:07,629 --> 00:43:09,245
Speaker 0: Yep I was thinking of the same moment.

607
00:43:09,266 --> 00:43:17,527
Speaker 1: Yep All right We'll leave it at that because I got a long weekend ahead of me And I smell the lamb cooking downstairs and I really want to eat it.

608
00:43:17,547 --> 00:43:20,696
Speaker 0: Yeah The smell of lamb doesn't do it for me.

609
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,342
Speaker 1: Well, you're just not human.

610
00:43:22,543 --> 00:43:24,410
Speaker 1: Lamb is my third favorite meat.

611
00:43:24,873 --> 00:43:26,608
