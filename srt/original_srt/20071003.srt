1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,158
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday October 3rd.

2
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:12,181
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,381 --> 00:00:14,348
Speaker 0: I'm rim, and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:19,310
Speaker 0: tonight We discussed two shows, but mostly get some end to hanky Mina.

5
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:25,397
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,292 --> 00:00:35,750
Speaker 1: So as you might have noticed from the forums and from the other shows this week and all next week probably we are taking your questions.

7
00:00:36,572 --> 00:00:39,142
Speaker 1: I had this up now, so we don't forget to talk about it later.

8
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:47,730
Speaker 0: if you want to know things That Google does not know that you know are things only known to me and rim ask us.

9
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,245
Speaker 0: This is your chance perhaps your only chance yep.

10
00:00:50,325 --> 00:01:04,418
Speaker 1: I mean a while ago We did a you know ask for him and Scott and most of the questions were personal questions But a lot of them were you know computer II whatever and we decided Partly due to people demanding another show like that to do a whole week of questions Sometime in the future once we have questions.

11
00:01:04,757 --> 00:01:13,884
Speaker 0: yep now if you want your question to actually be answered because of course we're not just gonna answer every question make sure that the question is a question that can't be answered by Google.

12
00:01:14,385 --> 00:01:21,370
Speaker 0: make sure it's a question that Doesn't take forever to talk about it because then we'll probably just turn it into a show idea instead of a question.

13
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:23,764
Speaker 0: Make sure it's a question.

14
00:01:23,804 --> 00:01:25,510
Speaker 0: That's not stupid.

15
00:01:26,931 --> 00:01:31,490
Speaker 0: And if you want us to answer it on Wednesday make sure it's an anime manga or comic question.

16
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:37,521
Speaker 1: Yep, either go to the forums and post it there in the relevant thread I'm sure you'll be able to find it or email us.

17
00:01:37,561 --> 00:01:40,170
Speaker 1: You know geek nights at front row crew calm.

18
00:01:40,814 --> 00:01:48,790
Speaker 0: Also, please when you send us your questions Try to send us just the question and not like this giant essay with a question hidden somewhere in there.

19
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:49,716
Speaker 0: Just ask the question.

20
00:01:49,736 --> 00:01:51,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're not gonna put the effort to find your question.

21
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:58,917
Speaker 0: yeah, just just ask the question in as few words and concisely and I guess not the way.

22
00:01:58,937 --> 00:02:01,269
Speaker 1: Scott just told you how to answer exactly.

23
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,431
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Right.

24
00:02:03,452 --> 00:02:04,334
Speaker 1: So what do you got in the news?

25
00:02:04,976 --> 00:02:07,021
Speaker 0: Well, you know Tintin, right?

26
00:02:07,463 --> 00:02:07,904
Speaker 1: Yeah, I do.

27
00:02:08,245 --> 00:02:10,070
Speaker 0: Yeah Tintin's that's good comics right there.

28
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,389
Speaker 1: I've never actually read Tintin.

29
00:02:12,671 --> 00:02:17,490
Speaker 0: I read a little Tintin and I've seen some Tintin cartoons and I know I want to read some Tintin.

30
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,955
Speaker 0: But it's sort of hard to.

31
00:02:19,898 --> 00:02:30,159
Speaker 0: it's sort of hard to figure out what to buy because it's not like like now I'm reading like Dick Tracy and stuff because IDW is publishing like Dick Tracy Volume one a whole lot of it.

32
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,950
Speaker 0: volume two a whole lot of it in order the whole thing, right?

33
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,313
Speaker 0: But Tintin is.

34
00:02:34,413 --> 00:02:39,250
Speaker 0: there's not really anything like that and there's some like censored volumes, you know and stuff like that.

35
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,927
Speaker 1: I'd imagine reading Tintin is a lot like reading Harlock just pick one and go with it.

36
00:02:42,947 --> 00:02:46,880
Speaker 1: And don't worry Don't even try to figure out what chronology there is or what.

37
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,723
Speaker 1: what happened when?

38
00:02:47,743 --> 00:02:50,010
Speaker 0: yeah, it's mostly just you know, separate adventures.

39
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:50,977
Speaker 0: It's not like Johnny Quest.

40
00:02:50,997 --> 00:02:52,670
Speaker 0: You don't have to watch them in any order, you know.

41
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:56,430
Speaker 0: This is a multi-parter but a multi-parter that all the parts will be included together.

42
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,916
Speaker 0: So Tintin is cool.

43
00:02:58,217 --> 00:02:58,900
Speaker 0: I like Tintin.

44
00:02:59,060 --> 00:02:59,683
Speaker 0: It's fun.

45
00:03:00,064 --> 00:03:01,329
Speaker 0: Classic adventure stories.

46
00:03:01,369 --> 00:03:10,527
Speaker 0: Well They're gonna be making some United States live-action, I think live-action Tintin movies, huh?

47
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:19,418
Speaker 0: Three Tintin movies one with the Peter Jackson action one with the Steven Spielberg Action and one with the we don't know who action.

48
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:23,149
Speaker 0: Oh, no, it's gonna be motion capture with 3d not live-action.

49
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,663
Speaker 1: Oh, Yeah, outstanding way to read that article.

50
00:03:26,703 --> 00:03:33,449
Speaker 0: we're yeah, we're bringing the news Article so someone else can read it and catch us when we don't read it.

51
00:03:34,701 --> 00:03:36,590
Speaker 0: But yeah This is pretty cool.

52
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:46,990
Speaker 0: And I think that this might encourage someone to reprint the Tintins in an accessible format So that way they can profit off of the heightened interest due to the movie, huh?

53
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:50,642
Speaker 0: And also I'll be able to buy the Tintin comics that I wanted.

54
00:03:50,682 --> 00:03:52,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I guess I hope the movie's good.

55
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,062
Speaker 1: I mean, we know how movies go when they're adapted from comics or anything.

56
00:03:56,183 --> 00:04:04,250
Speaker 0: Well, it's being written by Steven Moffat who is the writer of the new Doctor Who and some other BBC show called Jekyll.

57
00:04:04,371 --> 00:04:08,610
Speaker 0: So, I don't know cuz I've never seen either of those whether this guy can write or not.

58
00:04:08,971 --> 00:04:12,530
Speaker 1: I hear that the new Doctor Who is kind of awesome, but I haven't actually seen it.

59
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,779
Speaker 0: I've never seen old or new Doctor Who's there?

60
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,269
Speaker 1: Oh, man, the old Doctor Who is the bomb diggity.

61
00:04:18,051 --> 00:04:18,714
Speaker 0: So, what do I know?

62
00:04:19,196 --> 00:04:20,841
Speaker 1: Well, you know that you should watch some Doctor Who.

63
00:04:21,063 --> 00:04:22,810
Speaker 0: I know I should read some Tintin, right?

64
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:30,430
Speaker 1: So we've mentioned this off and on obliquely, but I think now that it's been announced officially We don't have to really beat around the bush anymore.

65
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:45,065
Speaker 1: We are going to be guests at the New York Anime Festival in Manhattan at the Jacob Javits Center December 7th through 9th yep, and If you were anywhere in the New York City area I would highly recommend you come at least for Saturday because we'll have a table.

66
00:04:45,106 --> 00:04:46,150
Speaker 1: We're doing four shows.

67
00:04:46,251 --> 00:04:48,268
Speaker 1: We'll be hanging out doing some match game action.

68
00:04:49,692 --> 00:04:55,118
Speaker 1: As long as our artist who may or may not still be working on it finishes We'll have some t-shirts to sell there.

69
00:04:55,138 --> 00:04:58,190
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, they better hurry up with that where the time's running out here.

70
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,585
Speaker 1: Yeah, I gotta call our artist probably tonight or tomorrow and ask what the dealio is.

71
00:05:02,725 --> 00:05:09,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yeah Um, I was originally skeptical about how this convention was gonna go because it is a for-profit.

72
00:05:09,771 --> 00:05:11,702
Speaker 1: You don't need to give this speech every time.

73
00:05:11,722 --> 00:05:12,909
Speaker 0: I gotta give this speech again.

74
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,970
Speaker 1: It's a for-profit con by the same people who did the New York Comic Con.

75
00:05:17,092 --> 00:05:28,579
Speaker 1: We wonder if that's gonna be good or bad but it seems like these people know what they're doing because they're actually Asking people who know about anime cons how to run an anime con and they've got a lot of talent here and everything seems to Be run the way it should be run and we're optimist at

76
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,302
Speaker 0: the very least.

77
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:35,250
Speaker 0: least if the convention sucks balls And is the worst thing it could possibly be will be there and our stuff will be awesome.

78
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:46,590
Speaker 1: Not only will we be there and we are doing our four events But we have some special guests who are going to be there with us People in tow if you will none other than Dave Riley and Joel White.

79
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,178
Speaker 0: Oh, you know what you want to say?

80
00:05:48,218 --> 00:05:49,343
Speaker 0: They're definitely gonna show up.

81
00:05:49,504 --> 00:05:50,750
Speaker 1: They said they're definitely gonna show up.

82
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:51,673
Speaker 1: They confirmed with me.

83
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:52,756
Speaker 1: They have badges.

84
00:05:53,177 --> 00:05:54,220
Speaker 1: They are coming.

85
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,850
Speaker 1: All right, if they don't come well, we'll see what happens.

86
00:05:58,051 --> 00:06:01,930
Speaker 0: But see I don't like to like say that kind of thing and then if they don't show up it makes us look bad.

87
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,195
Speaker 1: No, it'll make them look bad.

88
00:06:03,235 --> 00:06:03,617
Speaker 1: Believe me.

89
00:06:03,657 --> 00:06:08,937
Speaker 0: I'm if they don't show up remember don't tell us They screwed up not me.

90
00:06:09,098 --> 00:06:09,963
Speaker 1: No, they said they're coming.

91
00:06:10,084 --> 00:06:11,230
Speaker 0: All right, they confirmed.

92
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,632
Speaker 1: I have the.

93
00:06:11,712 --> 00:06:18,781
Speaker 1: I have the email where they don't show up for post that email and the very least Dave said that both of them were coming.

94
00:06:18,841 --> 00:06:20,750
Speaker 1: Joel did not directly contact me.

95
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,250
Speaker 0: Well, Joel also supposedly has disappeared from the face of the earth, but that happens semi regularly.

96
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,962
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean the New York Anime Festival is gonna be big.

97
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:31,370
Speaker 1: It's in the Javits, but there's one other thing.

98
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,999
Speaker 1: It's kind of a dual news here that they're doing that.

99
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:38,169
Speaker 1: I saw the news and I thought I but then I actually read it And I'm intrigued.

100
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:47,143
Speaker 1: Apparently the New York Anime Festival is doing a cosplay Masquerade kind of the way we always wanted it to be done.

101
00:06:47,604 --> 00:06:50,133
Speaker 0: Well sort of they are Pre-selecting.

102
00:06:50,153 --> 00:06:56,170
Speaker 1: there are only going to be 40 acts and they are going to pre-select them based on what you send them ahead of time.

103
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:00,270
Speaker 0: 40 X is a lot of X. so they must predict that there's gonna be a big turnout at the con.

104
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:05,505
Speaker 1: Well, there probably will be because one if the New York Comic Con both iterations was any indication.

105
00:07:05,866 --> 00:07:09,601
Speaker 1: if you advertise something at all In the New York City area pretty much.

106
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:11,409
Speaker 1: Everyone's gonna come no matter what it is.

107
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,857
Speaker 0: It's either gonna be crazy crowded or not.

108
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,485
Speaker 1: I imagine it's gonna be crazy crowded.

109
00:07:16,545 --> 00:07:17,668
Speaker 0: In fact, I hope so.

110
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,082
Speaker 0: It's good for me I'm a guest there.

111
00:07:19,143 --> 00:07:24,990
Speaker 1: Yeah But they're pre-selecting 40 acts and each act is gonna get three minutes on stage and all that business.

112
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:34,689
Speaker 1: so it's probably gonna be The best that a cosplay in this area could be because it's gonna be as far as they'll be able to tell the 40 best Most prepared most professional acts out there.

113
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,070
Speaker 1: But here's why I think they're gonna get 40 good acts.

114
00:07:38,532 --> 00:07:45,850
Speaker 1: This is not just the cosplay or the masquerade for the New York Anime Festival But they're going to send the winners to the world cosplay summit.

115
00:07:46,392 --> 00:07:51,150
Speaker 0: Oh, man, this is a real prize and not just someone saying you're awesome, but an actual prize.

116
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever big prize whatever act wins if it's stupid, you know, two people can go.

117
00:07:55,791 --> 00:08:03,610
Speaker 1: so if it's an act of six people they have to pick two which I Can just imagine the drama that is going to have to pick the two before you get before you.

118
00:08:04,272 --> 00:08:12,469
Speaker 1: I can still imagine the drama of any cosplay group with more than two members trying to decide who gets Designated as the person who will go if they win.

119
00:08:13,151 --> 00:08:17,347
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is they have to decide before they get up there so there'll be no grumpiness.

120
00:08:17,588 --> 00:08:21,470
Speaker 1: after they go There will be grumpiness, but they won't be able to fight over it cuz it'll be set in stone.

121
00:08:21,691 --> 00:08:24,528
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I think that's pretty cool.

122
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:27,017
Speaker 0: It might actually discourage cosplays.

123
00:08:27,078 --> 00:08:27,840
Speaker 0: more than two people

124
00:08:28,302 --> 00:08:38,566
Speaker 1: it might but at the same time just the way this is set up If they're gonna pick the 40 best even if a big, you know group of six goes and if they don't expect to win I Imagine this is gonna be 40 pretty damn good cosplay skits.

125
00:08:38,606 --> 00:08:39,169
Speaker 1: I might watch it.

126
00:08:39,772 --> 00:08:48,552
Speaker 0: I don't know if I'm gonna watch it because you know, even if you take let's say 70 people sign up and you pick the best 40.

127
00:08:48,552 --> 00:08:51,027
Speaker 0: You know only me, you know, how many of them there might be the 40 best.

128
00:08:51,591 --> 00:08:53,550
Speaker 0: But what if there's only 10 good ones at all?

129
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,532
Speaker 1: Well, I mean it depends.

130
00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:57,361
Speaker 1: Otacon last year had I think two or three good ones.

131
00:08:57,743 --> 00:08:59,849
Speaker 1: Yeah Otacon seems to average two or three good ones.

132
00:09:00,692 --> 00:09:02,136
Speaker 1: But Otacon lets anyone come in.

133
00:09:02,156 --> 00:09:03,119
Speaker 1: Yeah.

134
00:09:03,922 --> 00:09:06,268
Speaker 0: Oh, well, it'll be interesting to say the least.

135
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:12,510
Speaker 1: if anything I imagine this is going to attract a lot of those professional semi-professional super serious.

136
00:09:12,892 --> 00:09:13,878
Speaker 1: I are serious cat.

137
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,066
Speaker 1: this our serious business.

138
00:09:15,106 --> 00:09:15,690
Speaker 1: cosplayers.

139
00:09:16,134 --> 00:09:17,446
Speaker 0: Hopefully so hopefully.

140
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:25,890
Speaker 1: so yeah Because whatever people may say about cosplay calm and all those people who are a little too much into cosplay They are too much in the cosplay.

141
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:34,065
Speaker 0: They're not people I would hang out with or talk to and I kind of don't like their attitude But they the people who take the cosplay seriously, they take it seriously.

142
00:09:34,105 --> 00:09:35,690
Speaker 0: Thus they tend to do it better.

143
00:09:36,314 --> 00:09:46,464
Speaker 0: Yeah, and people who don't take it so seriously Things of the day.

144
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,490
Speaker 1: So Emily showed this to me.

145
00:09:48,571 --> 00:09:51,580
Speaker 1: She showed it to Scott and then me and it was pretty damn cool.

146
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,538
Speaker 1: So I want you all to see it.

147
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:58,960
Speaker 1: It's an animation by someone who attended the gobelline school in France, which is it is a school in France.

148
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:10,792
Speaker 1: I think it's in Paris where people Study visual art and animation that sort of thing and their film festivals tend to bring out a lot of awesome Animations, but Emily told me that you know like at NYU, right?

149
00:10:10,913 --> 00:10:13,160
Speaker 0: Everyone sort of has to make their own project.

150
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,720
Speaker 0: You know and you might get some help from people and whatnot.

151
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:22,620
Speaker 0: But you know you if you have an it's an animation class you make your animation and you submit it and it's yours.

152
00:10:23,142 --> 00:10:28,520
Speaker 0: But apparently at this school like they they team up, you know, like the whole group of people makes one thing.

153
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:40,175
Speaker 0: So even though they're just punk animation students and usually, you know an animation student project is not as quality as you know A real, you know big a Pixar production.

154
00:10:40,195 --> 00:10:40,596
Speaker 0: That's not

155
00:10:40,616 --> 00:10:41,841
Speaker 1: to say they aren't awesome No,

156
00:10:41,982 --> 00:10:56,560
Speaker 0: but when you have a bunch of them teaming up together on one thing instead of everyone doing their own thing there is a opportunity there for high quality things to be produced and Things that come out of the school because they're all done by groups of kids and students.

157
00:10:57,265 --> 00:10:58,131
Speaker 0: They're pretty awesome.

158
00:10:58,696 --> 00:11:09,279
Speaker 1: So thus Pirates, which I like to alternately call the way one piece should have been because I got to tell you there's a fight and it Ends in about a minute.

159
00:11:09,922 --> 00:11:12,771
Speaker 1: Someone my god, the fight is choreographed.

160
00:11:12,991 --> 00:11:14,075
Speaker 1: It's not just people yelling.

161
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:15,158
Speaker 1: people don't say a word.

162
00:11:16,922 --> 00:11:18,390
Speaker 1: One piece could have been so awesome.

163
00:11:18,953 --> 00:11:21,567
Speaker 0: I like how we go from Student animation.

164
00:11:21,587 --> 00:11:22,251
Speaker 0: That's pretty cool.

165
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,959
Speaker 0: Why you should watch it to one piece sucks.

166
00:11:24,181 --> 00:11:33,358
Speaker 1: Well, there's the thing and this just reminded me again because every time I see Anything about one piece or any art from one piece or anything from anything else that reminds me of one piece.

167
00:11:33,478 --> 00:11:37,092
Speaker 1: I remember Oh, yeah, one piece has everything going for it.

168
00:11:37,373 --> 00:11:39,100
Speaker 1: It's happy stylized pirates.

169
00:11:39,561 --> 00:11:48,264
Speaker 1: Nothing could be more up my alley than happy stylized pirates unless there were also air pirates and had dragons, but One piece just didn't deliver.

170
00:11:48,786 --> 00:11:49,848
Speaker 1: one piece is garbage.

171
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:51,413
Speaker 1: I can't stand that show.

172
00:11:51,653 --> 00:11:53,940
Speaker 1: it goes on forever and nothing fucking happens.

173
00:11:55,001 --> 00:11:58,113
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just can't stand any show where stuff goes on forever.

174
00:11:58,173 --> 00:11:58,575
Speaker 0: Nothing happened.

175
00:11:58,595 --> 00:11:59,880
Speaker 1: You watched a lot of one piece.

176
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,526
Speaker 0: I didn't watch that one piece.

177
00:12:01,606 --> 00:12:05,360
Speaker 0: I read 11 volumes of it, which I think I just talked about last two weeks ago.

178
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:07,347
Speaker 0: You talked about it recently at some point.

179
00:12:07,387 --> 00:12:09,154
Speaker 1: But yeah, yeah, regardless.

180
00:12:09,194 --> 00:12:12,910
Speaker 1: This animation is pretty cool and I like how it ends.

181
00:12:13,092 --> 00:12:16,308
Speaker 1: That's all I want to say All right, my thing today.

182
00:12:16,328 --> 00:12:24,180
Speaker 0: I had this thing of the day in the hopper for a while So of course is no longer on YouTube because the BBC must have told them to take it off YouTube.

183
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,098
Speaker 0: So I'm just gonna link to the BBC page about it and it's up to you to go find video of it.

184
00:12:29,218 --> 00:12:31,859
Speaker 0: be that Legally or illegally it's it's up to you.

185
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,613
Speaker 0: Basically, you know spider-man, right?

186
00:12:35,498 --> 00:12:36,822
Speaker 1: I know Spider-man.

187
00:12:36,842 --> 00:12:38,506
Speaker 1: spider-man is spider-man.

188
00:12:38,526 --> 00:12:38,807
Speaker 0: Yep.

189
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:40,431
Speaker 0: It was the original.

190
00:12:40,471 --> 00:12:44,160
Speaker 0: spider-man was written by Stanley and we talked about that before.

191
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:48,051
Speaker 0: But the who's the original artist who drew spider-man before anyone else?

192
00:12:48,191 --> 00:12:49,475
Speaker 1: fuck if I know Stanley.

193
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:56,633
Speaker 0: no Stanley can't draw I don't know anything about comics exactly the original artist of spider-man with Steve Ditko.

194
00:12:56,974 --> 00:12:57,716
Speaker 0: and there's a reason.

195
00:12:57,756 --> 00:13:00,244
Speaker 0: nobody knows that except for Superhero fans.

196
00:13:00,727 --> 00:13:06,553
Speaker 0: it's because he's a total recluse hermit Ha kind of like Bill Watterson sort of it pretty much.

197
00:13:06,673 --> 00:13:08,460
Speaker 0: I mean after he quit.

198
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,340
Speaker 0: You mean well even while he worked for Marvel Comics, right?

199
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:14,092
Speaker 0: He wouldn't get he wouldn't interview with anyone.

200
00:13:14,112 --> 00:13:16,000
Speaker 0: he wouldn't let anyone take his picture.

201
00:13:16,101 --> 00:13:18,139
Speaker 0: He wouldn't you know make any sort of public?

202
00:13:18,562 --> 00:13:29,004
Speaker 0: you know front of facing appearance of himself sort of the opposite of Stanley and I think he was quoted at least many places on the internet quote him as saying, you know I want people to.

203
00:13:29,024 --> 00:13:30,932
Speaker 0: you know, just look at my work.

204
00:13:31,012 --> 00:13:36,295
Speaker 0: and you know not consider, you know My personality in in the work, you know, just it's it's about my work.

205
00:13:36,335 --> 00:13:36,857
Speaker 0: Look at my work.

206
00:13:36,898 --> 00:13:37,380
Speaker 0: Don't look at me.

207
00:13:37,621 --> 00:13:40,000
Speaker 1: Well, at least he didn't bold his drawings randomly.

208
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:45,393
Speaker 0: No He's actually if you take all that the words out of like an old spider-man comic.

209
00:13:45,414 --> 00:13:57,542
Speaker 0: you can see Steve Ditko is pretty awesome with the the comic drawing but He drew a whole shit ton of comics for Marvel and he invented Doctor Strange and a whole bunch of other cool stuff and eventually Quit Marvel.

210
00:13:57,723 --> 00:14:00,049
Speaker 0: He didn't say why he never said why.

211
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:03,760
Speaker 0: ha yep, and he's an interesting person to learn about man.

212
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,413
Speaker 0: He's actually an excellent artist.

213
00:14:05,453 --> 00:14:06,179
Speaker 0: I like his art a lot.

214
00:14:06,561 --> 00:14:16,219
Speaker 0: That's one of the reasons I still buy those big black books essential books full of Marvel comics Even though most of the comics are not the greatest because his art is awesome in there.

215
00:14:16,781 --> 00:14:33,000
Speaker 0: But this thing of the day is a BBC documentary called in search of Steve Ditko And this guy named Jonathan Ross goes around talking to Steve Ditko's co-workers looking up everything He can find about the guy and I watched a bunch of it on YouTube before I got taken off.

216
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:33,845
Speaker 0: I didn't see the whole thing.

217
00:14:33,885 --> 00:14:35,494
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll try to get a DVD or something.

218
00:14:35,534 --> 00:14:36,399
Speaker 0: See me, you know, I don't know.

219
00:14:36,801 --> 00:14:38,088
Speaker 0: I think the BBC actually don't.

220
00:14:38,108 --> 00:14:39,756
Speaker 0: they let you download their shows from their site?

221
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:43,430
Speaker 0: I don't know I don't know but it's a really cool documentary.

222
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:46,340
Speaker 0: You can learn about Steve Ditko and there's one part at the end.

223
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,304
Speaker 0: That's super awesome.

224
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,329
Speaker 0: You want me to tell you what it was?

225
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:55,580
Speaker 0: Probably because people might not be able to find the video All right, so at towards the end of the thing, right they find out Steve Ditko.

226
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,620
Speaker 0: They know he lives in New York and he works in New York and he still makes comics.

227
00:14:58,721 --> 00:15:00,858
Speaker 0: He just doesn't work for Marvel or do anything famous.

228
00:15:00,898 --> 00:15:03,346
Speaker 0: now They knew where his office was.

229
00:15:03,887 --> 00:15:09,614
Speaker 0: so this Jonathan Ross guy and Neil Gaiman go they're like, we're gonna go up there We're gonna go up there.

230
00:15:11,104 --> 00:15:13,560
Speaker 0: So there's a they don't you know, they have a cameraman.

231
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:25,804
Speaker 0: but basically in the in the documentary because I watch this part they don't actually like go up there because You know with the camera because they don't let the camera guy up there and he doesn't want to take his picture hidden camera YouTube.

232
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:29,100
Speaker 0: I know I know but you can get in trouble because it's in his private office.

233
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,255
Speaker 1: Why don't we just stand outside the office or whatever?

234
00:15:31,276 --> 00:15:33,370
Speaker 1: he has to walk out So there's no one knows what he looks like.

235
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:34,800
Speaker 1: just take pictures of everyone who walks.

236
00:15:34,881 --> 00:15:36,159
Speaker 0: He's like an 80 year old man now.

237
00:15:36,321 --> 00:15:39,420
Speaker 1: So take pictures of everyone who walks out and then put a huge thing up where you're like.

238
00:15:39,729 --> 00:15:40,040
Speaker 1: Alright.

239
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,478
Speaker 1: Anyone who recognizes any of these other people tell us so we can take him out of the list of possible people.

240
00:15:44,638 --> 00:15:48,480
Speaker 0: he goes out The back door with a mask and he he goes out like spider-man swing on.

241
00:15:49,840 --> 00:16:03,837
Speaker 0: No, but they went up there and then when they got down they talked about what happened up there and apparently he was really nice And he gave them comics and he talked to them for a while But he wouldn't do an interview and he wouldn't had let them take his picture, you know, whatever.

242
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:09,735
Speaker 0: but yeah This is something really cool that anyone who cares about comics should probably pay attention to.

243
00:16:09,855 --> 00:16:15,539
Speaker 0: and even if you don't care about comics The documentary is actually really interesting in more ways than one.

244
00:16:16,162 --> 00:16:27,159
Speaker 1: So since we went super long yesterday talking about burning wheel Even though I get the feeling we said the same thing over and over again and not so many words But I get the same feeling as well, but I was super tired.

245
00:16:27,866 --> 00:16:36,213
Speaker 1: This show might not be super long But at the same time to make up for the fact that we don't know how long we'll go about the show We were gonna talk about we're talking about two shows.

246
00:16:36,835 --> 00:16:54,208
Speaker 1: Oh, man, luckily I don't have a lot to say about this show which is sad because I Expected when I saw the title of this show and when I saw the first two minutes of it that this was going to be The shit the business something awesome, but now Chibi kara go Nagai world is Gonna guys characters.

247
00:16:54,248 --> 00:16:56,380
Speaker 1: you may remember going a guy from such things as what?

248
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,454
Speaker 1: Well, you you should know who going a guy is by now if you listen to geek nights.

249
00:16:59,815 --> 00:17:00,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, what did he make?

250
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,644
Speaker 0: Devil, man, what else?

251
00:17:02,986 --> 00:17:04,752
Speaker 0: devil lady what else?

252
00:17:05,295 --> 00:17:15,487
Speaker 1: but this is a kind of anime of super deformed versions of his characters all fighting and interacting with each other and some sort of Weird, I don't know.

253
00:17:15,547 --> 00:17:17,819
Speaker 1: It's really crappy and that's all I really have to say about it.

254
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:22,900
Speaker 0: I think the biggest problem with it is that it actually tried to make a plot to explain the super deformity.

255
00:17:23,141 --> 00:17:27,335
Speaker 1: Not only that but it's really really really slow.

256
00:17:27,395 --> 00:17:33,815
Speaker 1: You'd expect funny things to happen But no It's just a scene that takes forever and nothing happens.

257
00:17:33,935 --> 00:17:38,880
Speaker 1: and these little super deformed characters Just talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and sometimes they don't talk.

258
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:45,976
Speaker 1: They just walk and walk and walk and walk and walk and walk and none of the jokes are funny Even if you rather or not, you know what they're referencing.

259
00:17:46,016 --> 00:17:46,880
Speaker 1: It's still not funny.

260
00:17:47,321 --> 00:17:54,840
Speaker 1: It's gets a semi serious every now and then and it's so not worth watching and it's so much longer than it should be.

261
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,007
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean we only watch like part.

262
00:17:57,348 --> 00:18:06,100
Speaker 0: I think we watched one whole episode of it and if something's chibi It's got to be crazy and energetic with stuff happening all over the place and crazy fun time.

263
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,152
Speaker 1: It's got to at least be like dragon half.

264
00:18:08,433 --> 00:18:09,600
Speaker 1: This is not dragon hand.

265
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:13,240
Speaker 0: This is like a really bad excuse to make some going a guy fan service.

266
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:21,604
Speaker 0: They took going a guy characters drew them in a chibi way and combined them all together in one sort of law drawn-out Slow plot.

267
00:18:21,644 --> 00:18:23,531
Speaker 0: that's not interesting and is very cliche.

268
00:18:23,551 --> 00:18:29,414
Speaker 0: and Blair and it could have been way cool I mean, you know get some messenger versus cutie honey.

269
00:18:29,555 --> 00:18:32,359
Speaker 0: action could have been pretty awesome But no they didn't do that.

270
00:18:32,781 --> 00:18:38,760
Speaker 1: So I guess you could call this a geek bite because it's so short, but I anti recommend this so hard.

271
00:18:38,841 --> 00:18:40,720
Speaker 1: Just don't even think about watching it.

272
00:18:41,902 --> 00:18:51,320
Speaker 0: Yes, if you're like some huge going a guy fanboy you might be able to extract some enjoyment from this But I don't know how much there's fast forward while you watch it.

273
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,875
Speaker 1: It's just so slow and you wouldn't expect something like that to be slow.

274
00:18:55,915 --> 00:18:57,480
Speaker 1: You'd expect people to be killing each other.

275
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,142
Speaker 1: I couldn't.

276
00:18:58,343 --> 00:19:04,388
Speaker 0: I couldn't even force myself to keep paying attention to what was going on while I was watching it and doing nothing else At the same time.

277
00:19:04,489 --> 00:19:05,357
Speaker 1: I almost fell asleep.

278
00:19:07,162 --> 00:19:08,248
Speaker 0: All right, we gotta talk about the show.

279
00:19:08,268 --> 00:19:11,061
Speaker 1: really want to talk about the real show cuz I'm done with this crap All right.

280
00:19:11,101 --> 00:19:14,656
Speaker 0: So the show we're actually gonna talk about today is called get cement.

281
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:18,140
Speaker 1: Oh, hey Kimina We might know it as that bunny girl show, right?

282
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,747
Speaker 0: We only watched one episode of it, but I think that's enough.

283
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:24,860
Speaker 0: now the story behind the show is this there is a another thing.

284
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:45,640
Speaker 0: I don't think it's an anime, but it's definitely a live-action movie and a manga and series of novels I think called densha otoko which translates to train man and The story of train man is I'm pretty sure it's a true story But it's sort of hard to tell these days because it's become sort of like a modern mythology of you know, this this otaku.

285
00:19:45,881 --> 00:19:54,240
Speaker 0: He's a nerdy otaku in Japan and he's got no friends and no life But he's an otaku and he like helps some woman on a train, you know.

286
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:03,290
Speaker 0: Well, he's riding a train as you know even otaku ride the train and he helps some woman who's a normal woman and Then they fall in love and get married and live happily ever after.

287
00:20:03,471 --> 00:20:04,133
Speaker 1: Ray.

288
00:20:04,153 --> 00:20:09,513
Speaker 0: and in densha otoko There is an anime much like in genshi ken.

289
00:20:09,533 --> 00:20:15,520
Speaker 1: you have the kuji biki unbalanced Which is I think I like genshi ken, but I really liked kuji bk.

290
00:20:15,701 --> 00:20:22,936
Speaker 1: The problem is when they made kuji bk into an actual, you know anime because it was so popular They didn't make it as crazy as it was in genshi ken.

291
00:20:23,459 --> 00:20:34,924
Speaker 0: Yep It should have been exactly as stupid and crazy as the genshi ken version was and it would have been awesome I agree, but it's sort of also like the itchy and scratchy to the Simpsons, you know, so Get cement.

292
00:20:34,944 --> 00:20:42,856
Speaker 0: oh hey Kimina is the anime that is in densha otoko and This is that anime on its own.

293
00:20:42,876 --> 00:20:50,467
Speaker 1: now I guess the one thing you'll have to know if you decide you want to watch this show is that it's not a show That's meant to be taken seriously.

294
00:20:50,788 --> 00:20:52,494
Speaker 0: No, I mean, here's the plot of the show.

295
00:20:52,514 --> 00:20:52,895
Speaker 0: You ready?

296
00:20:53,357 --> 00:20:54,300
Speaker 0: There are aliens.

297
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,597
Speaker 0: Aliens like earth sports sound similar to buzzer beater.

298
00:20:58,637 --> 00:21:03,029
Speaker 1: You're wrong You know, I'd forgotten about buzzer be.

299
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:06,040
Speaker 1: I know I had gotten past that in my life and you had to bring that.

300
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,831
Speaker 0: It's just funny that this two shows involving aliens and sports.

301
00:21:09,293 --> 00:21:10,016
Speaker 0: You got to admit this.

302
00:21:10,096 --> 00:21:11,120
Speaker 0: That's a strange coincidence.

303
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,500
Speaker 1: See we got to get bugs bunny in here because that was the members.

304
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,404
Speaker 1: I'll be jam.

305
00:21:14,545 --> 00:21:16,092
Speaker 1: talk about that on a Thursday space.

306
00:21:16,112 --> 00:21:17,780
Speaker 1: Yeah space jams pretty damn good space.

307
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:22,387
Speaker 0: Yeah, the original space jam awesome and add Newman in it Yeah, so there the.

308
00:21:22,527 --> 00:21:37,095
Speaker 0: the thing is the aliens aren't playing sports, but they're fans of sports on earth and Occasionally those alien sports fans come to earth and they cause trouble because you know They're aliens and they're all you know, like a normal crazy sports fan,

309
00:21:37,115 --> 00:21:37,918
Speaker 1: you know, it's like trouble

310
00:21:37,938 --> 00:21:38,460
Speaker 0: in the stands.

311
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,200
Speaker 1: It's like if a Mets fan goes to a Yankees game and causes trouble.

312
00:21:41,421 --> 00:21:48,287
Speaker 0: All right, but now you've got these aliens who are not only like bad fans, you know, they're troublesome fans But they're also aliens.

313
00:21:48,347 --> 00:21:53,439
Speaker 0: they cause double trouble like, you know They're a giant pile of slime filling up the stadium or something like that.

314
00:21:54,183 --> 00:22:00,889
Speaker 0: And you have this girl and this girl doesn't like carrots and She's trying to be like a TV anchor.

315
00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:02,815
Speaker 0: That's like she's like an intern for the.

316
00:22:02,976 --> 00:22:04,260
Speaker 0: they got a TV anchor in this.

317
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:10,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, she's also one of those high school student really cute really spunky really motivated kind of anime girls.

318
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,203
Speaker 0: Yeah, she's pretty cool.

319
00:22:11,283 --> 00:22:16,640
Speaker 0: Actually, she's not stupid, you know, and she's she says funny things and she yeah, she's not perfect.

320
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:22,663
Speaker 0: but then again, she's not just so dumb that you're like what the fuck's wrong with you and She's trying to do.

321
00:22:22,703 --> 00:22:36,345
Speaker 0: this apprenticeship and at that part of the show with the apprenticeship for the TV station is sort of like Myko 2010. we have a mast of like a production crew for a show and they're all different kinds of characters Mixing it up and there's fun times.

322
00:22:36,426 --> 00:22:41,100
Speaker 1: now a little warning Myko 2010 the anime is really really funny and worth watching.

323
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:49,232
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just a bunch of these really short episodes about this radio station that has a robot for its you know radio show host.

324
00:22:49,898 --> 00:22:53,711
Speaker 1: but Myko 2010 the anime is based on Myko 2010 the manga.

325
00:22:54,333 --> 00:23:01,839
Speaker 1: and I remember once I see cuz we we saw Myko 2010 the anime at the RIT anime club when one of those are not

326
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:02,922
Speaker 0: here 2000

327
00:23:02,922 --> 00:23:11,290
Speaker 1: because one of those who shall not be named fan sub did in his secret fan sub cloister and showed it to the club As like this special deal at a Saturday something.

328
00:23:11,451 --> 00:23:11,632
Speaker 1: Yep.

329
00:23:12,214 --> 00:23:15,268
Speaker 1: So, uh, it was all obscure No one could watch her find it.

330
00:23:15,308 --> 00:23:19,247
Speaker 1: and then the manga came out and I saw it in the store And I thought hot damn the Myko manga.

331
00:23:19,287 --> 00:23:23,645
Speaker 1: I'm totally gonna get this and I open it up and the first word I see is sex a bot.

332
00:23:24,146 --> 00:23:26,274
Speaker 0: Yeah closes the original manga.

333
00:23:26,475 --> 00:23:36,341
Speaker 0: Myko the robot Host was actually a robot sex bot that was used for being a show host instead of for sexing It's.

334
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:40,880
Speaker 1: it was really a creepy perverted manga and I don't recommend reading it.

335
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,940
Speaker 1: But I'm watching the show because it's really fun.

336
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:47,674
Speaker 0: The anime just removes all the pervertedness mostly and this has the same kind of vibe.

337
00:23:47,774 --> 00:23:57,240
Speaker 1: and I'll warn you though that the other half Of the show, you know Scott's the other their production news anchors, whatever This girl is a superhero magical girl.

338
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:04,480
Speaker 1: She turns into a bunny girl and with carrot rockets on her butt, but yeah, he's carrots and the carrot rockets are really cute.

339
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:11,814
Speaker 0: I think she turns into the super cat bunny girl when she eats a carrot which she doesn't like something like that But she I think she forced herself to eat some carrots later.

340
00:24:12,338 --> 00:24:25,239
Speaker 0: Yeah Okay, I've only seen one episode but there's like this bunny based like this rabbit fighting force of superhero people and They fight against the aliens who screw up the sports on earth.

341
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:37,710
Speaker 1: this part of the show has a very gatekeepers vibe just because when it when the funny girl wakes like awakens and all that business and it cuts to the bunny girl base on the moon and It's just yeah, it's yeah.

342
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:42,551
Speaker 0: pretty much this show is Gatekeepers plus mico 2010 plus a little bit of high school.

343
00:24:42,591 --> 00:24:45,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, but mine was no it has the same amount of high school.

344
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:52,127
Speaker 1: It's gatekeeper said what I guess what it lacks is the really dumb parts of gatekeepers at least so far because gatekeepers I got to admit really disappointed me.

345
00:24:52,388 --> 00:24:52,589
Speaker 0: Yeah.

346
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:57,975
Speaker 0: Well the action parts of gatekeepers for the business though Yeah, and they only lasted one episode.

347
00:24:57,995 --> 00:25:00,968
Speaker 0: They didn't drag him out They were all cool and choreographed and

348
00:25:01,129 --> 00:25:09,844
Speaker 1: I think the problem with gatekeepers was that it didn't go anywhere And that I mean the best part of that show as far as I was concerned was the fact that the base was like under The school and no one ever knew.

349
00:25:09,924 --> 00:25:13,135
Speaker 1: and those dust storms just randomly came the pointing commander.

350
00:25:13,155 --> 00:25:16,204
Speaker 0: Oh, man Phoenix Wright's Godfather is God.

351
00:25:16,244 --> 00:25:18,173
Speaker 1: we used to imitate that all the time.

352
00:25:18,193 --> 00:25:19,399
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was kind of a thing.

353
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:21,625
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's something about the pointing.

354
00:25:21,866 --> 00:25:29,584
Speaker 0: But yeah, if if you're looking for a comedic anime, this is sort of recent I mean it came out January of this year.

355
00:25:29,624 --> 00:25:30,227
Speaker 1: It's one of those.

356
00:25:30,307 --> 00:25:31,632
Speaker 1: just don't worry about it.

357
00:25:31,672 --> 00:25:38,016
Speaker 1: Just kind of sit back suspend your disbelief And roll with it and it's gonna be pretty funny that the main characters nemesis girl.

358
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:43,369
Speaker 1: She's one of those Nemesis, but she doesn't get annoying at least not yet.

359
00:25:43,389 --> 00:25:47,400
Speaker 0: Yep, and I think there's 11 episodes according to anime news network.

360
00:25:47,843 --> 00:25:56,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's really light-hearted and really fun And I mean there are other comedies out there But I I could see myself watching the rest of this one if I didn't have anything better to do.

361
00:25:56,321 --> 00:26:06,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not like some amazing life-changing anime But if you're looking for fun times and you want to fill those fun times with some short cute funny stuff.

362
00:26:06,582 --> 00:26:10,019
