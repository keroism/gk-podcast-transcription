1
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:08,040
Speaker 1: 

2
00:00:08,253 --> 00:00:10,120
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, December 7th, 2022.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:10,441
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:13,572 --> 00:00:14,009
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,576
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

6
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:18,950
Speaker 0: Tonight, we are reviewing the anime Spy X Family.

7
00:00:21,531 --> 00:00:22,528
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

8
00:00:23,771 --> 00:00:26,119
Speaker 0: So yeah, something amazing happened.

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,830
Speaker 0: Something that hasn't happened in many years for some reason.

10
00:00:29,391 --> 00:00:40,930
Speaker 0: Scott and I were at a gaming convention, simultaneously to do a panel, and we played at least one tabletop board game at said convention.

11
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:42,429
Speaker 1: And then we left.

12
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:43,312
Speaker 0: Yep, then we left.

13
00:00:43,673 --> 00:00:48,872
Speaker 0: It was a fun time, but still not at the point where I'm gonna go to a con for a whole weekend.

14
00:00:48,913 --> 00:00:57,750
Speaker 0: Even when I was out in Seattle, we spent a lot of time outdoors and tried to limit the amount of time we spent indoors at the con for all the reasons you might be able to imagine.

15
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:07,091
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the biggest problem is that like, you know, back in the day, we used to go to cons and everyone we knew at first, everyone we knew was going to all the cons.

16
00:01:07,131 --> 00:01:08,315
Speaker 1: It was a big party, right?

17
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,450
Speaker 1: And then we were going to cons to do geek dice shit.

18
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:18,130
Speaker 1: And some people went with us, but, you know, it was less and less people going with us, right?

19
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:22,308
Speaker 1: And those people who were going, a lot of them had their own shit to do.

20
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:24,176
Speaker 1: They weren't going to hang out with us the whole time, right?

21
00:01:24,196 --> 00:01:27,813
Speaker 1: They had to artist's alley table or their own panels or who knows what, right?

22
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:29,558
Speaker 1: Or a staff, right?

23
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:34,096
Speaker 1: So we were going to cons, especially Anime Boston was the one where this happened the most.

24
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:51,256
Speaker 0: I was about to say there's a big dichotomy between the gaming cons on this factor and all other kinds of cons, partly because gaming cons have a default of play a board game or know a lot of people who aren't in like the core circle who are likely to be at that con in normal times.

25
00:01:51,598 --> 00:01:53,225
Speaker 0: Anime cons, I didn't have as much of that.

26
00:01:53,406 --> 00:01:57,704
Speaker 0: And the people we knew are people who, uh, what are you going to do with the anime con?

27
00:01:57,744 --> 00:02:00,337
Speaker 0: I'm going to sit next to like my tool and watch something like.

28
00:02:00,377 --> 00:02:04,616
Speaker 0: that's fun, but that's not as fun as other things we could do, like talk, right?

29
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:15,239
Speaker 1: So like, you know, what happened to Anime Boston is many times you would go there and other than when we were doing our panels or going to the concerts or a few other, go to that one Godzilla panel that one time.

30
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:16,102
Speaker 1: Yeah.

31
00:02:16,142 --> 00:02:18,714
Speaker 1: A few other things on the schedule that stood out to us.

32
00:02:19,256 --> 00:02:19,538
Speaker 1: Right.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,591
Speaker 1: And then we go to the dealer's room once to go to the artist's alley once.

34
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:25,583
Speaker 1: And then we had a bunch of time to do nothing.

35
00:02:25,684 --> 00:02:25,884
Speaker 1: Right.

36
00:02:25,905 --> 00:02:33,868
Speaker 1: So we take a long breakfast and a long love, you know, and so go to Pax Unplugged here after so many years.

37
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:40,028
Speaker 1: And, you know, it's it was Pax Unplugged is like they rearrange the layout a bit, but it was.

38
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:45,408
Speaker 1: it was a happening, you know, in terms of we went on Sunday and one panel at like eleven thirty a.m.

39
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:49,081
Speaker 0: on Sunday completely filled the room in and mostly filled the room.

40
00:02:49,182 --> 00:02:50,386
Speaker 0: It filled the room.

41
00:02:50,446 --> 00:02:54,036
Speaker 0: The official email I got there, they turned several people away.

42
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:05,334
Speaker 1: But anyway, the the con was pretty happening and the expo area was bigger than I'd ever seen it at Pax Unplugged, having only really missed one unplugged.

43
00:03:05,414 --> 00:03:05,695
Speaker 1: All right.

44
00:03:05,876 --> 00:03:06,037
Speaker 0: Yeah.

45
00:03:06,057 --> 00:03:07,444
Speaker 0: We'll get to that on a Tuesday show.

46
00:03:07,464 --> 00:03:09,592
Speaker 0: There's some interesting trends in what.

47
00:03:09,913 --> 00:03:12,159
Speaker 0: what the booth were at this Pax, actually.

48
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,480
Speaker 0: Yeah.

49
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:20,472
Speaker 1: But anyway, the you know, for the only thing that would have told you that this was a Sunday was the fact that it ended early instead of going midnight.

50
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:21,656
Speaker 1: Right.

51
00:03:21,836 --> 00:03:24,505
Speaker 1: So I imagine it had to be even bigger on Friday and Saturday.

52
00:03:24,967 --> 00:03:25,449
Speaker 1: So it was.

53
00:03:25,649 --> 00:03:26,311
Speaker 1: it was happening.

54
00:03:26,492 --> 00:03:28,778
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was a full a full pax.

55
00:03:28,858 --> 00:03:30,803
Speaker 1: Nothing at the pax itself was lacking.

56
00:03:31,104 --> 00:03:31,846
Speaker 1: Yeah.

57
00:03:32,528 --> 00:03:38,288
Speaker 1: But, you know, because we did not have a whole bunch of people, RP, at least our people there.

58
00:03:38,429 --> 00:03:38,569
Speaker 1: Right.

59
00:03:38,589 --> 00:03:40,623
Speaker 1: There are obviously a bunch of people there, but they weren't our people.

60
00:03:40,764 --> 00:03:40,965
Speaker 1: Yeah.

61
00:03:41,026 --> 00:03:43,735
Speaker 1: Only some of them were our people.

62
00:03:44,196 --> 00:03:48,066
Speaker 1: It's like if we had been there for more than the one day.

63
00:03:48,086 --> 00:03:48,186
Speaker 1: Right.

64
00:03:49,268 --> 00:03:49,890
Speaker 1: There was still.

65
00:03:50,091 --> 00:03:52,180
Speaker 1: there was stuff I was not able to do.

66
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:52,542
Speaker 1: Right.

67
00:03:52,622 --> 00:03:54,290
Speaker 1: I didn't get to look at the first look area.

68
00:03:54,531 --> 00:03:54,771
Speaker 1: Right.

69
00:03:55,173 --> 00:03:57,199
Speaker 1: I didn't go to the classic cardboard area.

70
00:03:57,219 --> 00:03:59,928
Speaker 1: I didn't go to any panel other than my own.

71
00:04:00,249 --> 00:04:00,470
Speaker 1: Right.

72
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,014
Speaker 1: I didn't you know, there was.

73
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:07,691
Speaker 1: there was more con provided content that I could have done had I been there an extra time.

74
00:04:07,851 --> 00:04:08,112
Speaker 1: Right.

75
00:04:08,773 --> 00:04:18,255
Speaker 1: But even if I added all of Saturday, just one more day, I would have run out of things to do if I didn't have people to play games with.

76
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:25,618
Speaker 1: I would have had to play games with strangers in a normal pre covid pax situation or in or join the enforcers again.

77
00:04:25,638 --> 00:04:32,309
Speaker 0: But even if no one else we knew would come except the people who we knew and we were hanging out with on Sunday were there in a pre covid pax.

78
00:04:32,892 --> 00:04:35,402
Speaker 0: I would not have run out of stuff to do, but I do a lot of things you don't do.

79
00:04:35,482 --> 00:04:39,179
Speaker 0: Like I will go hang out at bars and after parties to meet people and I will.

80
00:04:39,299 --> 00:04:41,047
Speaker 1: That's not that's not a pax activity.

81
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:43,779
Speaker 0: It's the activity that only happens because those people are at.

82
00:04:44,643 --> 00:04:45,686
Speaker 0: and I'm also talking about.

83
00:04:45,867 --> 00:04:47,593
Speaker 1: I'm talking about things to do at the pax.

84
00:04:47,674 --> 00:04:56,723
Speaker 0: Also, I will often at pre covid paxes also then arrange in the convention to meet up with those people and play games and do things.

85
00:04:57,165 --> 00:04:59,797
Speaker 0: The people that I met sometimes at the external event.

86
00:05:00,179 --> 00:05:02,749
Speaker 1: And that's something that's having your people there.

87
00:05:03,572 --> 00:05:04,717
Speaker 0: But I seek out more people.

88
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:13,668
Speaker 0: And one thing I noticed about this pax specifically was because I'm in a mask and everyone else in the mask, I was losing my voice quickly because I was basically yelling the whole time.

89
00:05:15,253 --> 00:05:18,926
Speaker 0: And also, I wouldn't necessarily recognize people right away.

90
00:05:18,966 --> 00:05:23,421
Speaker 0: Like I walked past our friend Pat and I realized afterward I walked past him.

91
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:24,685
Speaker 0: I didn't recognize him at first.

92
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:36,981
Speaker 1: So the thing is, I guess like, you know, over a week ago now, like last Monday, I got some kind of sniffly cough cold deal and I tested is definitely not the sea.

93
00:05:37,382 --> 00:05:38,988
Speaker 1: I don't have the sea at the same thing.

94
00:05:39,068 --> 00:05:42,199
Speaker 1: Sam Rosen got, I don't know, it could be RSV.

95
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,741
Speaker 1: Who knows?

96
00:05:42,822 --> 00:05:43,123
Speaker 1: Right.

97
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:44,046
Speaker 1: It could be cold.

98
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:46,475
Speaker 1: And I was like, well, I'm going to.

99
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,764
Speaker 1: am I going to go to this pax or not with this cold?

100
00:05:48,804 --> 00:05:48,965
Speaker 1: Right.

101
00:05:48,985 --> 00:05:51,194
Speaker 1: I probably shouldn't be going if I'm not feeling good.

102
00:05:51,836 --> 00:05:55,331
Speaker 1: And so I was 50 50 the night before, like legitimately 50 50.

103
00:05:55,331 --> 00:05:56,435
Speaker 1: And I'm like, well, you know what?

104
00:05:57,058 --> 00:06:02,820
Speaker 1: If I wake up, because basically almost every morning I would wake up and have like a coughing fit situation.

105
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:03,382
Speaker 1: Right.

106
00:06:03,402 --> 00:06:06,592
Speaker 1: So I'm like, well, I'll just wake up tomorrow.

107
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:09,762
Speaker 1: I'll set this alarm for the be in time to get the train.

108
00:06:10,184 --> 00:06:15,581
Speaker 1: And if I have a coughing fit and if I feel mad, I just won't go because it was covered.

109
00:06:15,802 --> 00:06:16,745
Speaker 0: I could do the panel anyway.

110
00:06:16,786 --> 00:06:20,520
Speaker 0: Like I've done three paxes by myself and one with Emily.

111
00:06:21,221 --> 00:06:27,296
Speaker 1: But I woke up and I and I honestly felt 95 to 99 percent recovered.

112
00:06:27,376 --> 00:06:27,617
Speaker 1: Right.

113
00:06:27,657 --> 00:06:31,028
Speaker 1: Like there was only the tiniest tickle remaining.

114
00:06:31,369 --> 00:06:32,734
Speaker 1: And you were with me all day.

115
00:06:32,835 --> 00:06:32,995
Speaker 1: Right.

116
00:06:33,035 --> 00:06:36,508
Speaker 1: How much you were basically all day from before we got on the train.

117
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:37,291
Speaker 1: Right.

118
00:06:37,593 --> 00:06:41,187
Speaker 0: Well, you know, you're like me on a normal day because I'm non covid.

119
00:06:41,228 --> 00:06:43,880
Speaker 0: I get allergies and I'm just kind of confidence in my way through life.

120
00:06:44,881 --> 00:06:45,944
Speaker 1: It's like at the pax.

121
00:06:46,004 --> 00:06:47,247
Speaker 1: Did I cough at the pax?

122
00:06:47,528 --> 00:06:47,829
Speaker 1: Yes.

123
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:52,603
Speaker 1: But like a handful of times, like I didn't cough during the panel.

124
00:06:53,145 --> 00:06:55,596
Speaker 1: I did a whole panel with no coffin and a cough on the train.

125
00:06:56,118 --> 00:06:58,689
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, I coughed a handful of times.

126
00:06:58,789 --> 00:06:59,894
Speaker 1: It definitely was.

127
00:07:00,055 --> 00:07:05,938
Speaker 1: it felt like, you know, the day after you've definitely recovered from something as a minor remnant.

128
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:06,420
Speaker 1: Right.

129
00:07:07,481 --> 00:07:07,722
Speaker 1: Okay.

130
00:07:07,902 --> 00:07:08,645
Speaker 1: So I was like, good.

131
00:07:08,665 --> 00:07:11,355
Speaker 1: I luckily healed just in time for pax.

132
00:07:11,476 --> 00:07:12,540
Speaker 1: It was it was a sign.

133
00:07:12,961 --> 00:07:13,242
Speaker 1: Right.

134
00:07:13,743 --> 00:07:16,955
Speaker 1: You know that the timing was so perfect and that.

135
00:07:17,096 --> 00:07:22,276
Speaker 1: and then I went to bed after getting home from pax and I wake up the next day and I'm caught.

136
00:07:22,296 --> 00:07:23,701
Speaker 1: I've been coughing all over the place again.

137
00:07:23,741 --> 00:07:25,589
Speaker 1: It's already the pax was Sunday.

138
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:26,573
Speaker 1: We only went one day.

139
00:07:26,593 --> 00:07:28,742
Speaker 1: It's currently Wednesday and I'm still caught.

140
00:07:28,762 --> 00:07:40,868
Speaker 0: And one thing I can say is in my normal life, like it came right back in old days when I go to a con, like I would get a scratchy throat and be coffee after every con just because I mean, you know me, I just talk constantly.

141
00:07:40,888 --> 00:07:41,550
Speaker 0: It's never shut up.

142
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:52,131
Speaker 0: So eventually, you know, I learned to not lose my voice by doing radio voice like all the time and like being quiet like we had to do with voice protection.

143
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:52,833
Speaker 1: This is illness.

144
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:57,834
Speaker 0: But I'm saying in normal times, I'll just get a cough after pretty much any con or any major thing.

145
00:07:58,115 --> 00:08:00,969
Speaker 0: I'd even get that after like major work events just in my normal life.

146
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:03,843
Speaker 1: Definitely the same exact cough that I had before.

147
00:08:03,863 --> 00:08:04,526
Speaker 1: That is just.

148
00:08:04,868 --> 00:08:05,130
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

149
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,256
Speaker 0: No, I'm not talking about your cough.

150
00:08:06,296 --> 00:08:14,029
Speaker 0: Talking on my own third situation because no one cares about your throat because one thing I've noticed is all the mast paxes I've been to.

151
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:29,143
Speaker 0: I even if I'm barely in the con, I just I talk so loud and I talk so much and I have to talk louder to hear myself and for other people to hear me that my throat feels at the end of these after like one day what normally three or four days of cons is.

152
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:32,981
Speaker 0: how like that's that's how many days of convention yelling it takes to get me to that point.

153
00:08:33,725 --> 00:08:36,118
Speaker 1: You know, other people can hear you even if you can't hear yourself.

154
00:08:36,178 --> 00:08:36,881
Speaker 1: You don't have to be that loud.

155
00:08:36,982 --> 00:08:37,224
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

156
00:08:37,244 --> 00:08:40,520
Speaker 0: But I found people repeatedly at all the at all these mass cons.

157
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,668
Speaker 0: I often have people ask me to repeat myself.

158
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,537
Speaker 0: It's been it's been a thing.

159
00:08:44,577 --> 00:08:47,266
Speaker 0: So I find myself just talking louder anyway.

160
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:54,073
Speaker 0: But I'm pretty much still not dive in a while for the foreseeable future, but we'll probably be at PAX East doing some panels.

161
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,988
Speaker 0: But again, I don't think we're going to hang out at PAX East the whole time.

162
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,781
Speaker 0: Still, it's still probably a little too soon for that.

163
00:09:00,503 --> 00:09:00,864
Speaker 1: Who knows?

164
00:09:01,065 --> 00:09:01,386
Speaker 1: All right.

165
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:05,760
Speaker 1: So I'm sure there's news, but I want to talk about something.

166
00:09:06,141 --> 00:09:11,133
Speaker 1: right as I finally got Saga trade paperback volume 11.

167
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:15,186
Speaker 0: I forgot Saga existed until you were like, oh, hey, I'm going to get by Saga.

168
00:09:15,206 --> 00:09:15,950
Speaker 0: There's more.

169
00:09:16,211 --> 00:09:16,934
Speaker 0: there's more issues.

170
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:23,021
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, because we talked about it, I think rim red volume like one and we did a show on it and we never talked about it again.

171
00:09:23,302 --> 00:09:23,543
Speaker 1: Right.

172
00:09:23,883 --> 00:09:27,954
Speaker 1: But Saga ran from twenty twelve to twenty eighteen.

173
00:09:27,995 --> 00:09:33,048
Speaker 1: So there was six years and sixty fifty four issues.

174
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:33,669
Speaker 1: Right.

175
00:09:33,689 --> 00:09:40,608
Speaker 1: So there are fifty four individual floppy comics in nine volumes of Saga that came out over those six years.

176
00:09:40,869 --> 00:09:41,049
Speaker 1: Right.

177
00:09:41,591 --> 00:09:48,149
Speaker 1: And then it was a major, major ending that rim hasn't reached yet in that night.

178
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,014
Speaker 1: End of that ninth volume issue.

179
00:09:50,055 --> 00:09:53,685
Speaker 1: Fifty four had a major ending like a big time ending.

180
00:09:53,746 --> 00:09:56,193
Speaker 0: We reviewed Saga in twenty thirteen.

181
00:09:56,956 --> 00:09:57,197
Speaker 1: Yeah.

182
00:09:57,337 --> 00:09:59,605
Speaker 1: When it was about like one volume was out.

183
00:09:59,685 --> 00:09:59,986
Speaker 1: Right.

184
00:10:00,086 --> 00:10:02,374
Speaker 0: And we reviewed the six volumes.

185
00:10:02,495 --> 00:10:06,109
Speaker 1: The six issues came out in twenty twelve, but like late twenty twelve.

186
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:09,985
Speaker 1: And then the first the cop, the trade paperback for the six issues came out in twenty three.

187
00:10:10,005 --> 00:10:15,772
Speaker 0: For whatever reason, we reviewed it alongside also reviewing the Star Wars comic like we did two reviews in that show.

188
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:16,696
Speaker 0: Right.

189
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:21,029
Speaker 1: Well, that was around the time when, you know, Marvel Disney bought Marvel.

190
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:26,543
Speaker 1: And then so the Star Wars comics moved from Dark Horse to Marvel.

191
00:10:26,804 --> 00:10:27,104
Speaker 0: Yeah.

192
00:10:27,124 --> 00:10:28,107
Speaker 0: Right.

193
00:10:28,347 --> 00:10:28,608
Speaker 1: Anyway.

194
00:10:29,449 --> 00:10:38,332
Speaker 1: So Saga, after a hiatus since September twenty eighteen or whatever, I guess, you know, effectively a four year, three or four years hiatus.

195
00:10:38,894 --> 00:10:39,135
Speaker 1: Right.

196
00:10:39,456 --> 00:10:43,008
Speaker 1: Saga came back in January with issue number fifty five.

197
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:43,530
Speaker 1: Right.

198
00:10:44,433 --> 00:10:45,195
Speaker 1: And it's still going.

199
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:46,158
Speaker 1: It's every month.

200
00:10:46,218 --> 00:10:48,664
Speaker 1: there's another issue of Saga is going again.

201
00:10:49,927 --> 00:10:58,427
Speaker 1: And trade paperback number ten was recently ish released like a month or two ago, I'd say.

202
00:10:58,628 --> 00:10:58,788
Speaker 1: Right.

203
00:10:58,808 --> 00:11:01,997
Speaker 1: That contains issues fifty five through sixty.

204
00:11:02,057 --> 00:11:03,922
Speaker 1: So five more issues combined.

205
00:11:04,804 --> 00:11:10,499
Speaker 1: And I'm like, you know, Saga was, you know, like S tier graphic storytelling.

206
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:10,700
Speaker 1: Right.

207
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,161
Speaker 1: Already.

208
00:11:11,342 --> 00:11:11,623
Speaker 1: Yeah.

209
00:11:11,863 --> 00:11:21,867
Speaker 1: But it's like what what could go away for four years, three or four years, have already this ending beyond belief.

210
00:11:22,288 --> 00:11:22,609
Speaker 1: Right.

211
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:28,480
Speaker 1: And then come back and immediately remain at S tier.

212
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:29,762
Speaker 1: Right.

213
00:11:30,825 --> 00:11:52,560
Speaker 1: It's like has anything ever gone away, come back and not been, you know, way different, way worse, way, you know, maybe it's like I can't think of any serial storytelling thing ever that like had a hiatus that was that long and came back and was as good as if it was never gone.

214
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,967
Speaker 0: Ah, how long was it between some of those Venture Brothers seasons?

215
00:11:57,027 --> 00:12:01,335
Speaker 0: That might be like one of the only things on the Saga level.

216
00:12:01,395 --> 00:12:02,196
Speaker 1: I would say I would say so.

217
00:12:02,216 --> 00:12:21,636
Speaker 1: See, I would say that, you know, in terms of just English language, right, graphic storytelling, that Saga is probably the best that has been created this millennium.

218
00:12:22,017 --> 00:12:22,278
Speaker 1: Right.

219
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:29,084
Speaker 1: So are you going to say that Venture Brothers is the best English animated storytelling this millennium?

220
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:29,726
Speaker 1: No, I don't think so.

221
00:12:29,747 --> 00:12:30,389
Speaker 0: It might be up there.

222
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,276
Speaker 0: I think it's a contender.

223
00:12:32,296 --> 00:12:33,464
Speaker 0: You don't know.

224
00:12:33,484 --> 00:12:34,270
Speaker 0: You don't watch anything.

225
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,893
Speaker 0: Spikes family is definitely not.

226
00:12:36,953 --> 00:12:38,197
Speaker 0: It's good, but it's not.

227
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,182
Speaker 1: So, yeah.

228
00:12:40,283 --> 00:12:41,686
Speaker 1: So Saga is back.

229
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:49,620
Speaker 1: If you have never read Saga for some reason, because, you know, you've never been listening to Geek Nights for, I don't know, nine years.

230
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,159
Speaker 0: I'll let you do a review, because if I recall correctly, our review is basically, "Oh my God, it's so good.

231
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:55,265
Speaker 0: Oh my God, just read it.

232
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:56,671
Speaker 0: When the thing happened, oh my

233
00:12:56,691 --> 00:12:56,973
Speaker 0: God.".

234
00:12:56,993 --> 00:12:58,862
Speaker 0: And we were talking about like one or two trades.

235
00:12:59,565 --> 00:13:03,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think, you know, we need to definitely, you know, read.

236
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,245
Speaker 1: Well, I've read everything.

237
00:13:05,305 --> 00:13:09,740
Speaker 1: Rym needs to read a whole bunch and then we could actually talk about what's happening in this story.

238
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,964
Speaker 0: I should catch up.

239
00:13:11,285 --> 00:13:15,641
Speaker 0: My interest is rekindled, especially now that I know it is coming out again.

240
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:19,878
Speaker 1: Yeah, just to give you an idea of like how good I think Saga is, right?

241
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,769
Speaker 1: At some point, I don't know if it was moving or on vacation.

242
00:13:22,789 --> 00:13:24,698
Speaker 1: I had all the original nine volumes.

243
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:26,043
Speaker 1: They're gone.

244
00:13:26,104 --> 00:13:26,947
Speaker 1: I don't know what happened to them.

245
00:13:27,048 --> 00:13:27,831
Speaker 1: I lent them to someone.

246
00:13:27,852 --> 00:13:28,636
Speaker 1: They didn't give them back.

247
00:13:28,717 --> 00:13:29,481
Speaker 1: Someone stole them.

248
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,024
Speaker 1: I lost them.

249
00:13:30,064 --> 00:13:30,829
Speaker 1: I left them somewhere.

250
00:13:30,849 --> 00:13:31,492
Speaker 1: I don't fucking know.

251
00:13:31,512 --> 00:13:31,994
Speaker 1: They're gone.

252
00:13:32,114 --> 00:13:32,737
Speaker 0: Just buy them again.

253
00:13:32,757 --> 00:13:33,078
Speaker 1: So I went.

254
00:13:33,681 --> 00:13:34,524
Speaker 1: Yeah, I ordered.

255
00:13:35,046 --> 00:13:38,902
Speaker 1: They have a box you can buy that has the nine volumes in a single box.

256
00:13:38,982 --> 00:13:39,665
Speaker 0: I see that box.

257
00:13:39,725 --> 00:13:41,051
Speaker 0: It's on the website right there.

258
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:43,764
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just bought that box to replace the nine I had lost.

259
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,452
Speaker 1: And then I ordered volume ten.

260
00:13:45,472 --> 00:13:50,210
Speaker 1: And that so I have all of it except for the few issues that have been out.

261
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:55,944
Speaker 1: If you really want to, they do sell a deluxe hardcover set.

262
00:13:56,625 --> 00:14:02,767
Speaker 1: And instead of buying nine volumes, you can buy three deluxe hardcovers that will cover the nine volumes.

263
00:14:02,928 --> 00:14:05,455
Speaker 1: So basically three trades per hardcover.

264
00:14:06,116 --> 00:14:15,283
Speaker 1: They also sell the saga compendium paperback, which is one mega book that has issues one through fifty four.

265
00:14:15,363 --> 00:14:16,969
Speaker 1: So nine volumes in a single.

266
00:14:17,571 --> 00:14:22,938
Speaker 0: Well, like like one of those old like the years they had, sir, that would fall apart, that had an inch and a half thick binding.

267
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:23,520
Speaker 1: Right.

268
00:14:23,581 --> 00:14:24,966
Speaker 1: So there are four different.

269
00:14:25,087 --> 00:14:27,536
Speaker 1: And then I guess I don't know if you can buy it digitally or not.

270
00:14:27,577 --> 00:14:28,038
Speaker 1: Let me check.

271
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:32,578
Speaker 0: It was on Comixology, but Comixology, of course, has issues.

272
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,584
Speaker 0: And we've talked about that.

273
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:37,520
Speaker 0: And it doesn't really work that well anymore in the whole Amazon.

274
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,844
Speaker 1: Who knows what's going on with that.

275
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:42,278
Speaker 1: But I'm sure there's a digital way to read it.

276
00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:44,930
Speaker 0: Oh, Comixology and Kindle are still listed.

277
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:52,590
Speaker 1: In fact, if you have Kindle Unlimited, you can get volume one for zero dollars on Kindle.

278
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,833
Speaker 0: That's definitely worth it.

279
00:14:54,595 --> 00:14:54,856
Speaker 1: Yeah.

280
00:14:55,357 --> 00:14:55,879
Speaker 1: So there you go.

281
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:56,942
Speaker 0: All right.

282
00:14:57,283 --> 00:15:11,940
Speaker 0: So in some news, you may remember a while ago that Funimation, there's a whole situation where basically Funimation, which is Sony, bought Crunchyroll away from AT&T.

283
00:15:13,102 --> 00:15:20,863
Speaker 0: It's still bad that that list of nouns is together in one big corporate merger acquisition situation.

284
00:15:20,983 --> 00:15:23,752
Speaker 0: But that happened and people kind of wondered how this would go.

285
00:15:24,073 --> 00:15:28,068
Speaker 0: We're starting to see the early glimmers of how this is going to go.

286
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:32,842
Speaker 0: So there's a. there's a story, but then there's a buried lead in the story.

287
00:15:32,862 --> 00:15:36,774
Speaker 0: The story is now Crunchyroll and Funimation.

288
00:15:36,794 --> 00:15:38,601
Speaker 0: They're basically replacing all their SKUs.

289
00:15:39,043 --> 00:15:53,655
Speaker 0: So all the old Funimation SKUs are being retired and all the things that Funimation put out are going to have new SKUs through Crunchyroll, confirming that they are keeping Crunchyroll as the primary brand for this stuff going forward.

290
00:15:53,696 --> 00:15:53,856
Speaker 1: Yeah.

291
00:15:53,876 --> 00:15:59,521
Speaker 1: I mean, it's like you have basically two streaming services that are both streaming anime owned by the same company.

292
00:15:59,621 --> 00:16:06,830
Speaker 1: It's like the only real decision of which one to choose is which one has more users and which one has a brand that people know.

293
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:12,716
Speaker 1: And I definitely feel like Crunchyroll has the better brand in the English speaking world than Funimation does.

294
00:16:12,736 --> 00:16:13,539
Speaker 0: I think so.

295
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:14,644
Speaker 0: I would not disagree.

296
00:16:14,664 --> 00:16:20,063
Speaker 1: It doesn't really matter to them which one of them is the winner because they're the same fucking company.

297
00:16:20,284 --> 00:16:22,712
Speaker 1: Just like Grubhub Seamless.

298
00:16:22,792 --> 00:16:28,006
Speaker 1: It's basically the same exact website only with a different skin.

299
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:33,083
Speaker 1: It's like they keep them both because both brands have cachet in different areas.

300
00:16:33,445 --> 00:16:37,020
Speaker 1: But it's literally the exact same website just with two different skins on it.

301
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,442
Speaker 1: Yeah.

302
00:16:37,482 --> 00:16:43,612
Speaker 0: Like you can see lately, there's a few restaurants near us where the same restaurant is listed with two different names and two different menus.

303
00:16:43,913 --> 00:16:44,917
Speaker 0: But it's the same address.

304
00:16:44,978 --> 00:16:45,781
Speaker 0: It's the same kitchen.

305
00:16:46,062 --> 00:16:47,890
Speaker 0: It's literally the same restaurant.

306
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:48,551
Speaker 1: Yeah.

307
00:16:49,153 --> 00:16:57,559
Speaker 1: So I wonder why I thought that they might have gone with that kind of strategy of keeping both Funimation.com and Crunchyroll.com.

308
00:16:58,321 --> 00:17:02,372
Speaker 1: But no matter which one you go to, it's the same exact website.

309
00:17:02,412 --> 00:17:03,957
Speaker 1: It just has a different logo at the top.

310
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:05,742
Speaker 0: Never mind the things they sell.

311
00:17:05,763 --> 00:17:11,746
Speaker 0: Funimation had DVDs and stuff, but I guess those are going to all be Crunchyroll SKUs going forward.

312
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:13,071
Speaker 1: Crunchyroll has a shop.

313
00:17:13,795 --> 00:17:14,297
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

314
00:17:14,357 --> 00:17:16,085
Speaker 1: But yeah, the Crunchyroll brand is stronger.

315
00:17:16,224 --> 00:17:18,012
Speaker 1: So it's also a valid business choice.

316
00:17:18,334 --> 00:17:19,419
Speaker 0: But they warned everyone.

317
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,130
Speaker 1: The Funimation brand and go with the Crunchyroll.

318
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:27,488
Speaker 0: Many titles may be unavailable to purchase until the SKU migration is complete.

319
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:33,436
Speaker 0: Like things that had the old SKU won't be able to be purchased by anyone until the new SKU comes online for the same thing.

320
00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:37,415
Speaker 0: And they won't give a timeline on that and they won't say which titles are affected and when.

321
00:17:37,475 --> 00:17:40,570
Speaker 0: But there's going to be like an ongoing thing for possibly many months.

322
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,653
Speaker 1: Who cares?

323
00:17:42,713 --> 00:17:45,320
Speaker 0: So that was the article buried in.

324
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,771
Speaker 0: this news article was a very, very important piece of news.

325
00:17:50,312 --> 00:17:54,803
Speaker 0: So the entire world right now has generally been moving toward ads.

326
00:17:56,006 --> 00:18:04,818
Speaker 0: So services that previously would just have a pay option like say Disney Plus are moving toward also having a cheaper tier where they shove ads in your face.

327
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:06,024
Speaker 0: But then they charge you less money.

328
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:08,896
Speaker 1: I read an article actually about the Disney CEO change.

329
00:18:09,257 --> 00:18:09,819
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

330
00:18:10,421 --> 00:18:11,364
Speaker 1: It was on the verge.

331
00:18:11,464 --> 00:18:23,825
Speaker 1: And one of the things in that article that they mentioned was that the CEO of Disney who just got ousted, one of the things they did was promised to Wall Street like big, big numbers for Disney Plus.

332
00:18:23,845 --> 00:18:26,996
Speaker 1: And those numbers were sort of unrealistic and hard to reach.

333
00:18:27,638 --> 00:18:32,439
Speaker 1: And so the reason that Disney did the ad supported thing was it's a way to boost the numbers.

334
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:39,267
Speaker 1: They were basically just doing everything they can to meet the number that they had told to Wall Street a too big a number.

335
00:18:39,348 --> 00:18:43,742
Speaker 1: And rather than pull the number back, they would do the ad thing.

336
00:18:44,144 --> 00:18:50,969
Speaker 1: Whether or not the ad thing was a good business decision, it was that they had a different goal in mind in doing it.

337
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:59,559
Speaker 1: So the fact that you would see crunchy roll, right, getting rid of the ad, you know, support free tier, right?

338
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:00,964
Speaker 1: It's like they're.

339
00:19:01,065 --> 00:19:05,501
Speaker 1: only they don't have that kind of Wall Street, you know, motivator or other reasoning, right?

340
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:09,897
Speaker 1: So this must be for them what they believe to be a good business strategy up.

341
00:19:09,918 --> 00:19:12,810
Speaker 0: So the new strategy is actually, I think, pretty good.

342
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:13,652
Speaker 0: So here's the deal.

343
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:27,032
Speaker 0: Starting with the spring 2022 season, like that was already up and out there on Crunchyroll in March, they will no longer have ad supported viewing for any titles going forward.

344
00:19:27,092 --> 00:19:27,634
Speaker 0: Full stop.

345
00:19:27,895 --> 00:19:28,838
Speaker 0: Like it is over.

346
00:19:29,219 --> 00:19:31,126
Speaker 1: So but for titles going forward.

347
00:19:31,146 --> 00:19:33,777
Speaker 1: But what about existing titles that already are ad support?

348
00:19:33,837 --> 00:19:37,533
Speaker 0: Existing titles will be dropped at some point probably next year as well.

349
00:19:37,814 --> 00:19:41,830
Speaker 0: So there will be no shows that are just free to watch on Crunchyroll with ads.

350
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,073
Speaker 0: Gotta have a real account.

351
00:19:43,334 --> 00:19:43,996
Speaker 0: that costs money.

352
00:19:44,738 --> 00:19:58,995
Speaker 0: However, they said that the plan is to have every single show have the first three episodes be available for anyone to watch with ads, which is a really good idea.

353
00:19:59,015 --> 00:20:00,240
Speaker 0: That sort of gives one.

354
00:20:00,301 --> 00:20:02,249
Speaker 0: people could check out a show.

355
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:10,293
Speaker 0: You know, we always said from RIT anime onward and even geek nights, four episodes of an anime 99.9% of the time.

356
00:20:10,735 --> 00:20:13,330
Speaker 0: That is enough to figure out if you want to watch the rest of that show.

357
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,300
Speaker 0: Three episodes, probably 90%.

358
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,849
Speaker 0: Like that's still probably enough episodes to figure it out.

359
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:22,984
Speaker 0: So that means anyone who wants to try out a show could just watch it.

360
00:20:23,406 --> 00:20:27,385
Speaker 0: Even if they if they if they like the show and they want to watch more, if they're hooked, they got to pay.

361
00:20:27,968 --> 00:20:30,057
Speaker 0: If they don't watch anymore, well, they still.

362
00:20:30,238 --> 00:20:36,166
Speaker 0: Crunchyroll still got some money because that poor kid watched a bunch of ads while they were watching the first three episodes that they blocked them.

363
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:38,775
Speaker 0: I don't can block those ads easily.

364
00:20:38,795 --> 00:20:41,283
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can block everything.

365
00:20:41,423 --> 00:20:49,295
Speaker 0: I have found that ads within streaming services are increasingly difficult to block and a lot of services just fail when the ad block kicks in anyway.

366
00:20:49,535 --> 00:21:03,985
Speaker 1: So yeah, I think this is, you know, when you look at like the video game market, right, where you have share wares and you have demos, it's been shown that like people play a demo of a game or a shareware of a game like, you know, the first few levels.

367
00:21:04,648 --> 00:21:10,511
Speaker 1: And even though they beat the game, they're like, OK, I learned, you know, I got enough of an experience from that game.

368
00:21:10,973 --> 00:21:15,430
Speaker 1: And they actually don't feel the need now to buy the game and beat the whole frickin thing.

369
00:21:15,571 --> 00:21:15,711
Speaker 1: Right.

370
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:16,455
Speaker 1: It's like they had enough.

371
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,164
Speaker 1: You know, it's like they beat the demo.

372
00:21:18,547 --> 00:21:19,854
Speaker 1: It's like that's the that's an ending.

373
00:21:20,075 --> 00:21:21,101
Speaker 1: It's like, OK, good enough.

374
00:21:21,181 --> 00:21:22,489
Speaker 0: I mean, think back to Castle Crashers.

375
00:21:22,509 --> 00:21:23,472
Speaker 0: You play the first two levels.

376
00:21:23,513 --> 00:21:24,074
Speaker 0: That's the whole game.

377
00:21:24,094 --> 00:21:24,496
Speaker 0: You're done.

378
00:21:24,556 --> 00:21:26,482
Speaker 0: You're good anyway.

379
00:21:26,582 --> 00:21:34,348
Speaker 1: So the so it's shown that like if you don't have a demo for your video game, you'll actually get more sales.

380
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:36,075
Speaker 1: You're better off having a trailer.

381
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:36,637
Speaker 1: Right.

382
00:21:36,657 --> 00:21:40,393
Speaker 1: There's a trailer shows someone that it's the kind of game they want to play.

383
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:41,358
Speaker 1: They're enticed.

384
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:44,672
Speaker 1: They see that they can't play even one minute unless they pay money.

385
00:21:44,692 --> 00:21:46,118
Speaker 1: and then they pay the money.

386
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,975
Speaker 1: And even if they quit after three levels, you got the same amount of case in point.

387
00:21:50,015 --> 00:21:50,698
Speaker 0: call to the lamb.

388
00:21:50,718 --> 00:21:51,582
Speaker 0: A lot of people bought it.

389
00:21:52,265 --> 00:21:59,090
Speaker 0: And I think a lot of people didn't realize it's basically Binding of Isaac and not the farm like the town building being.

390
00:21:59,110 --> 00:21:59,811
Speaker 0: they thought it was.

391
00:22:01,556 --> 00:22:06,107
Speaker 1: So, yeah, but with anime, it doesn't work that way.

392
00:22:06,248 --> 00:22:06,448
Speaker 1: Right.

393
00:22:06,509 --> 00:22:08,436
Speaker 1: It's like you see three episodes of an anime.

394
00:22:08,476 --> 00:22:11,208
Speaker 1: It's like if you don't like the anime, OK, sure.

395
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:12,955
Speaker 1: You're probably not getting past what it says.

396
00:22:12,995 --> 00:22:14,943
Speaker 0: You say it's a show that you say you don't like.

397
00:22:15,685 --> 00:22:22,995
Speaker 0: And then the fourth of the third episode, in our case, the fourth episode, that talk to me guy like they don't actually finish the race.

398
00:22:23,237 --> 00:22:24,303
Speaker 0: You don't know if you want or not.

399
00:22:24,383 --> 00:22:25,007
Speaker 0: You're curious.

400
00:22:25,047 --> 00:22:25,952
Speaker 0: You want to know if you won.

401
00:22:26,073 --> 00:22:28,748
Speaker 1: It's like if you like an anime, it's like you got to watch the whole thing.

402
00:22:28,768 --> 00:22:30,355
Speaker 1: You can't stop in an episode three.

403
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:30,836
Speaker 1: Right.

404
00:22:30,997 --> 00:22:36,940
Speaker 1: And so that's a good way, you know, to entice people because it's not like people are out there watching anime trailers.

405
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,290
Speaker 1: Anime trailers are not very convincing.

406
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:46,599
Speaker 0: I mean, if anything, what I used what I used to do back when I watched a lot more anime is I'd watch AMV's and almost treat those like trailers.

407
00:22:46,779 --> 00:22:48,023
Speaker 0: If I'd like a show or not.

408
00:22:49,147 --> 00:22:54,985
Speaker 1: I mean, if I was an anime maker, I would make AMV's of my own anime as the trailer.

409
00:22:55,025 --> 00:22:55,627
Speaker 0: Oh, hell yeah.

410
00:22:55,868 --> 00:22:58,135
Speaker 0: And you know what anime they actually did that for?

411
00:22:58,156 --> 00:22:59,460
Speaker 0: Escaflowne.

412
00:23:00,303 --> 00:23:03,292
Speaker 0: There are official music videos to Escaflowne that are out there.

413
00:23:04,655 --> 00:23:14,701
Speaker 0: So in some other news, so Makoto Shinkai's new film, Suzume, the one with the door and the hot boy and the clouds.

414
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:15,805
Speaker 1: The guy turns into a chair.

415
00:23:15,906 --> 00:23:17,351
Speaker 0: I was going to say that in a second.

416
00:23:17,632 --> 00:23:25,979
Speaker 0: The show that is about clouds and colorful skies and girls with long dark hair who tie their back with long red ribbons and hot guy.

417
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,232
Speaker 0: And I guess the guy turns into a chair and there's a cuba.

418
00:23:29,252 --> 00:23:34,431
Speaker 0: And this this movie looks like it's all over the place in the kind of way that we it's been out for a while.

419
00:23:34,451 --> 00:23:35,314
Speaker 1: Yeah, Japan.

420
00:23:35,574 --> 00:23:38,782
Speaker 0: We now have the dates April 12th, 13th and 14th.

421
00:23:39,063 --> 00:23:46,042
Speaker 0: There will be theater screenings everywhere in the world outside of Asia where there's a market.

422
00:23:46,483 --> 00:23:50,800
Speaker 0: So April 14th is the day for the United States and the United Kingdom.

423
00:23:51,102 --> 00:23:53,452
Speaker 0: You can check this website to figure out if your country is covered.

424
00:23:54,215 --> 00:24:01,156
Speaker 0: So April 14th, there will almost definitely be multiple screenings of Suzume at theaters in New York City.

425
00:24:01,176 --> 00:24:09,120
Speaker 0: I'm just going to put a note in my calendar and remember, I assume we're all going to go see this movie on April 14th.

426
00:24:10,244 --> 00:24:16,247
Speaker 1: Despite the fact that, you know, Shinkai has not been, you know, he had the year name, which was the global sensation.

427
00:24:16,709 --> 00:24:18,777
Speaker 0: One of the most popular animated movies ever.

428
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:19,179
Speaker 0: Yeah.

429
00:24:19,681 --> 00:24:26,647
Speaker 1: Despite the fact that we, you know, we don't we personally don't put him as good as, you know, some of the other contemporaries right now.

430
00:24:27,149 --> 00:24:28,493
Speaker 1: You know, still going to go see it.

431
00:24:28,553 --> 00:24:29,216
Speaker 1: Yeah.

432
00:24:29,577 --> 00:24:32,809
Speaker 1: And other news of movies coming to the United States.

433
00:24:32,949 --> 00:24:33,130
Speaker 1: Right.

434
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:44,058
Speaker 1: Shin Ultraman, which came out in Japan earlier this year, much earlier this year, is finally going to be in theaters in the U.S.

435
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:45,984
Speaker 1: in on January.

436
00:24:46,044 --> 00:24:47,990
Speaker 1: So they had to wait for a whole year.

437
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:48,951
Speaker 0: Yeah.

438
00:24:49,011 --> 00:24:51,317
Speaker 0: I see Astoria Kaufman, January 11th, January.

439
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:52,520
Speaker 0: So January 11th, 2023.

440
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:58,718
Speaker 1: There'll be a subtitled, you know, screening.

441
00:24:59,239 --> 00:25:01,749
Speaker 1: And January 12th, there'll be a dubbed screening.

442
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:06,210
Speaker 1: So perhaps some of the time it took to bring it over was because they really wanted to make that dub.

443
00:25:07,011 --> 00:25:18,676
Speaker 1: And you got to presume that, you know, after this movie comes out, you know, in the theater in January, there's going to be all kinds of, you know, streaming and DVD, Bure and all that.

444
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,588
Speaker 1: You know, you're going to be able to watch Shin Ultraman.

445
00:25:20,648 --> 00:25:25,434
Speaker 1: So I really want to watch it and I'm probably going to go on January 11th.

446
00:25:25,534 --> 00:25:25,834
Speaker 1: Yeah.

447
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:34,205
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

448
00:25:34,586 --> 00:25:40,289
Speaker 0: So I cannot stress enough, Disco Elysium is one of the best single player games I've played since Breath of the Wild.

449
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:41,094
Speaker 0: It's just that good.

450
00:25:41,516 --> 00:25:48,304
Speaker 0: Now I'm going to dive into Pentiment, which is in many ways, mechanically and thematically similar, though they are very different games.

451
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:53,870
Speaker 0: So most likely our next Tuesday show, we're going to review Pentiment, but I like Disco Elysium enough.

452
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:54,954
Speaker 0: I'm playing it through a second time.

453
00:25:55,316 --> 00:26:01,757
Speaker 0: And my thing of the day is a little animatic music video someone made to Disco Elysium, but it's to a song.

454
00:26:02,158 --> 00:26:03,523
Speaker 0: And this one, this video is great.

455
00:26:03,543 --> 00:26:04,327
Speaker 0: Like this is really funny.

456
00:26:04,628 --> 00:26:06,940
Speaker 0: If you haven't played the game, it's still funny.

457
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:07,823
Speaker 0: You played the game.

458
00:26:07,923 --> 00:26:11,754
Speaker 0: It is extremely funny and extremely poignant.

459
00:26:12,315 --> 00:26:22,206
Speaker 0: However, the song, if you just watch this, you might think clearly some nerds made this song to go with this video to make fun of Disco Elysium.

460
00:26:22,969 --> 00:26:24,133
Speaker 0: It's too on the nose.

461
00:26:24,494 --> 00:26:28,225
Speaker 0: It's too close to what happens, like what the actual game is about.

462
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:32,075
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day is not so much that video.

463
00:26:32,597 --> 00:26:34,703
Speaker 0: It is the band that made the song.

464
00:26:34,783 --> 00:26:40,621
Speaker 0: The song is called Party Time by the Northern Boys and they actually have a music video.

465
00:26:41,343 --> 00:26:48,002
Speaker 0: And the Northern Boys are basically three old men who sing about how deeply sad sack their lives are.

466
00:26:48,604 --> 00:26:50,369
Speaker 0: And it is fantastic.

467
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:51,673
Speaker 0: It is really funny.

468
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,278
Speaker 0: I recommend this band.

469
00:26:53,578 --> 00:27:00,661
Speaker 0: It's actually a pretty good song, but the lyrics are, this is, this is extremely dark humor and we'll leave it at that.

470
00:27:00,681 --> 00:27:02,587
Speaker 0: So what do you got?

471
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:08,008
Speaker 1: So recently I was talking with someone about some, you know, old vinyl records, right?

472
00:27:08,068 --> 00:27:15,281
Speaker 1: And they were, they were talking about how like they had Sesame Street vinyls and you know, and I was like, well, I didn't realize the C is for cookie came out on vinyl.

473
00:27:15,321 --> 00:27:16,484
Speaker 1: That's right.

474
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:24,222
Speaker 1: Uh, and then I remembered when I was a kid that I had a Pac-Man vinyl record of some kind.

475
00:27:24,744 --> 00:27:40,330
Speaker 1: And I remember when I got it as like a gift, I think, and it was just so weird to me because up until that point, every vinyl record I had ever seen was just some sort of like actual album by a band of some sort, right?

476
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:44,122
Speaker 1: Like, you know, Rolling Stones, something album, right?

477
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,831
Speaker 1: Like I'd never seen a vinyl album.

478
00:27:46,851 --> 00:27:48,859
Speaker 1: that wasn't, you know, something else.

479
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:53,619
Speaker 1: I had seen cassette tapes that were like, you know, listen and read, you know, with a book for it.

480
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,744
Speaker 0: Cause you're a kid.

481
00:27:55,165 --> 00:27:59,902
Speaker 0: My childhood was filled with vinyls that had like coloring books and activity books with them.

482
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:02,291
Speaker 1: Not all the ones that I had.

483
00:28:02,351 --> 00:28:17,125
Speaker 1: that were some sort of kids thing that weren't, you know, a, an album where cassette tapes for my Fisher Price cassette player, even though I had a big bird record player, I had that big bird record player, the big bird record player played, you know, queen or whatever.

484
00:28:17,386 --> 00:28:19,656
Speaker 0: It's like, what's the player for 45?

485
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:20,500
Speaker 0: Like, I feel like it was small.

486
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,083
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

487
00:28:21,123 --> 00:28:28,700
Speaker 1: Now you could put, you could put either one on there, but yeah, it was the, if you put on a full size vinyl, it would sort of hang over the edge, but it worked anyway.

488
00:28:30,161 --> 00:28:33,896
Speaker 1: So this, I had this Pac-Man album when I was a kid and I looked it up.

489
00:28:34,037 --> 00:28:35,884
Speaker 1: It's called the amazing adventures of Pac-Man.

490
00:28:35,904 --> 00:28:38,312
Speaker 1: It was put out by kids stuff, records and tapes.

491
00:28:39,074 --> 00:28:39,857
Speaker 1: And was it rare?

492
00:28:39,877 --> 00:28:44,256
Speaker 1: Was, was I, did I experience some album that like no one's ever heard of?

493
00:28:44,316 --> 00:28:46,425
Speaker 1: And I had like an ultra rare thing and it's gone now.

494
00:28:47,289 --> 00:28:47,972
Speaker 1: Absolutely not.

495
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:49,056
Speaker 1: It was common as dirt.

496
00:28:49,157 --> 00:28:50,462
Speaker 1: Everyone's heard this fucking thing.

497
00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:51,567
Speaker 1: It was all over the place.

498
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,699
Speaker 1: Kids in the eighties had this thing all over.

499
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:56,205
Speaker 1: So it's on YouTube.

500
00:28:56,225 --> 00:28:57,208
Speaker 1: You can just listen to it.

501
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,055
Speaker 1: It's really bad and painful.

502
00:28:59,336 --> 00:29:03,775
Speaker 1: It's narrated by, you know, people who think that this will be entertaining for children.

503
00:29:03,795 --> 00:29:08,556
Speaker 0: The seven minute and nine second mark is where do you think it's as dire as it could be?

504
00:29:08,596 --> 00:29:10,203
Speaker 0: And it's somehow worse after that point.

505
00:29:10,484 --> 00:29:15,926
Speaker 1: And they want to make money cause it's 1980 something and Pac-Man is like a huge craze right now.

506
00:29:15,946 --> 00:29:21,489
Speaker 0: Like if you think a white knuckle scoring was a cynical cash grab, it's got nothing on this Pac-Man thing.

507
00:29:21,931 --> 00:29:22,212
Speaker 1: Yeah.

508
00:29:22,233 --> 00:29:29,775
Speaker 1: So go on, if you got some minutes, go on YouTube and listen to the vinyl album, the amazing adventures of Pac-Man.

509
00:29:29,795 --> 00:29:32,483
Speaker 1: I want to sort of point out one thing.

510
00:29:32,543 --> 00:29:35,313
Speaker 1: I actually learned something about Pac-Man that I did not know.

511
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:42,695
Speaker 1: I was under the impression until just now when re re-listening to this album, right?

512
00:29:42,856 --> 00:29:49,800
Speaker 1: At least a few minutes of it, that the names of the Pac-Man ghosts were Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde, right?

513
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,502
Speaker 1: Those are the names.

514
00:29:50,662 --> 00:29:52,168
Speaker 1: I've always called them those four names.

515
00:29:53,071 --> 00:30:01,456
Speaker 1: And that's not wrong, but apparently the truth is that their actual names are obviously Japanese names, right?

516
00:30:01,897 --> 00:30:05,126
Speaker 1: Oikake, Machibuse, Kimagure, and Otoboke.

517
00:30:05,326 --> 00:30:09,500
Speaker 1: And those translate to chaser, ambusher, fickle, and stupid.

518
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:09,881
Speaker 0: Yep.

519
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:15,053
Speaker 1: This is according to Wikipedia.

520
00:30:15,094 --> 00:30:18,885
Speaker 0: ABC News has an article that explains this, actually, weirdly enough.

521
00:30:18,905 --> 00:30:20,313
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm ready to get into Wikipedia.

522
00:30:20,775 --> 00:30:25,753
Speaker 1: But on the album, they call the ghosts Shadow, Speedy, Bashful, and Pokey.

523
00:30:25,813 --> 00:30:29,026
Speaker 1: And I'm like, whoa, did they just get the names wrong on this album?

524
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:33,223
Speaker 0: It sounds like they took the Japanese and just translated it themselves badly.

525
00:30:33,403 --> 00:30:34,507
Speaker 1: That's not true at all.

526
00:30:34,969 --> 00:30:43,879
Speaker 1: What happened is that Midway Games, when they brought Pac-Man to the United States, they changed the names of the ghosts to Shadow, Speedy, Bashful, and Pokey.

527
00:30:44,641 --> 00:30:56,790
Speaker 1: And then if you actually look at a Pac-Man machine and actually pay attention to what's on the screen, which I've never done, apparently, it actually says on the screen of Pac-Man, you can go to Wikipedia for ghosts Pac-Man.

528
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:58,337
Speaker 1: They have their own page, right?

529
00:30:58,397 --> 00:30:59,120
Speaker 1: Just for the ghosts.

530
00:31:01,221 --> 00:31:08,463
Speaker 1: And sure enough, their real names are, at least in English, according to Midway, are Shadow, Speedy, Bashful, and Pokey.

531
00:31:08,864 --> 00:31:15,421
Speaker 1: And Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde are their nicknames in the English canon.

532
00:31:15,441 --> 00:31:18,771
Speaker 0: That's a fairly elegant way around that.

533
00:31:19,273 --> 00:31:21,680
Speaker 1: So I just never realized that those were nicknames.

534
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,908
Speaker 1: I thought that those were their real names in English.

535
00:31:25,494 --> 00:31:30,166
Speaker 1: And I was wrong, and the album actually got their real names right-ish.

536
00:31:30,326 --> 00:31:34,496
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess the only way to be more right would have been to call them Oikake.

537
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:37,465
Speaker 1: I don't think they're going to be doing that.

538
00:31:37,566 --> 00:31:38,789
Speaker 0: I love these track names too.

539
00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:45,490
Speaker 0: We've got Pac-Man Theme, we've got Take the Fruit and Scoot, Slightly Lazy Crazy Day, and The Chase.

540
00:31:46,491 --> 00:31:46,671
Speaker 1: Yep.

541
00:31:47,815 --> 00:31:48,437
Speaker 1: I also like that.

542
00:31:48,477 --> 00:31:57,009
Speaker 1: on the cover of the album, there's this rat guy who's not a character in Pac-Man at all, but they needed more characters because just Pac-Man and four ghosts.

543
00:31:57,069 --> 00:31:59,981
Speaker 0: Also, what's the ghost doing with that fruit in the background?

544
00:32:00,624 --> 00:32:06,544
Speaker 1: Well, in the story is that they're all in Pacville, and Pacville is all about fruit and also pretzels.

545
00:32:06,945 --> 00:32:11,060
Speaker 0: Yep, as we know from the NES game Pac-Man, that is not the Pac-Man you all know.

546
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,512
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess Dig Dug must be digging under Pacville, that's why.

547
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:16,277
Speaker 0: Ahh.

548
00:32:16,297 --> 00:32:17,720
Speaker 1: Where does the Galaga Ship come from, though?

549
00:32:20,808 --> 00:32:22,633
Speaker 0: Don't go too deep into that, Laurie, you'll go crazy.

550
00:32:23,335 --> 00:32:28,790
Speaker 0: In the meta moment, the Geeknides Book Club book is Alif the Unseen.

551
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,657
Speaker 1: I read a few chapters.

552
00:32:30,938 --> 00:32:36,097
Speaker 0: I expect in January we'll do an episode on it, it's not gonna be a super long read, but it's not gonna be as fast as Binti.

553
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:45,648
Speaker 1: I read a few chapters, stuff's moving along, it's all, you know, you got a cyberpunk dude, he's hacking and he's getting in trouble.

554
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:46,130
Speaker 1: Yep.

555
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:51,872
Speaker 0: We were, of course, just at Pacs Unplugged 2022, we did a panel, why does the game take four hours to play?

556
00:32:52,334 --> 00:32:59,422
Speaker 0: If you've somehow missed it or you're curious about the topic, there's video of a similar panel we did at the last Pacs Unplugged before.

557
00:32:59,482 --> 00:33:03,897
Speaker 0: Covid called Take Your Fucking Turn, which is on YouTube, you can just watch.

558
00:33:04,178 --> 00:33:08,918
Speaker 0: I also posted a link to the slides we used from the panel at Pacs Unplugged on Sunday.

559
00:33:08,939 --> 00:33:13,539
Speaker 0: I've been trying to post the slides more and more because I found that people do actually go look at them.

560
00:33:13,981 --> 00:33:28,280
Speaker 0: I even left one of them with comments on and people were like leaving comments, like it was, there were some interesting insights that people like added or asked questions, so I might see if that's a thing we could engage with in some fashion down the road, like sharing the slides more directly and openly.

561
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:34,824
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah, the next convention that we have any chance of going to is going to be Pacs East.

562
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:35,447
Speaker 1: Yeah.

563
00:33:35,487 --> 00:33:37,114
Speaker 1: The dates are announced, they're what?

564
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:45,424
Speaker 0: Oh, Pacs East is going to be, the panel submission is just open too, and I got to tell you, they've now migrated the rest of their stuff to Growtix.

565
00:33:45,866 --> 00:33:57,322
Speaker 0: For the first time since 2008, when I've submitted panels to every Pacs forever, it's a different website now, it's that Growtix backend, the same one we used to use at Kineticon.

566
00:33:57,884 --> 00:33:59,550
Speaker 0: Well, so we'll see how that goes.

567
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:17,703
Speaker 1: But anyway, March 23rd through 26th, 2023, it's still four days, and if you don't know, if you didn't hear the news already, the policy for Pacs East is going to be, they're not going to check the VACs, but they're going to require the mask, right?

568
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:23,920
Speaker 1: Pacs Unplugged did check the VACs, Pacs East is not going to check it, and that's that.

569
00:34:25,003 --> 00:34:30,498
Speaker 1: Yep, so like I said, you have to decide on your own if you're going to go or not go.

570
00:34:30,518 --> 00:34:33,706
Speaker 1: If that is a factor in your decision.

571
00:34:33,726 --> 00:34:43,440
Speaker 0: I significantly expect for us, we, or possibly, depending on the pain in the ass of doing this, just me, will show up just to do a few panels and hang out.

572
00:34:43,801 --> 00:34:47,492
Speaker 0: It is highly unlikely we will be there the entire Pacs East.

573
00:34:49,917 --> 00:34:53,284
Speaker 1: Anyway, so Spy X Family.

574
00:34:53,585 --> 00:35:01,910
Speaker 0: This show, among our friends, like people I talked to online, like all the anime people, they were like really into this show after it came out.

575
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:08,294
Speaker 1: Like this appeared- This show is clearly just based on, you know, the buzz of being connected to the internet, right?

576
00:35:08,735 --> 00:35:11,684
Speaker 1: Is a popular, very, very popular show, right?

577
00:35:12,025 --> 00:35:14,813
Speaker 1: Around the whole anime communities, right?

578
00:35:14,853 --> 00:35:16,439
Speaker 1: People love this show.

579
00:35:16,459 --> 00:35:19,369
Speaker 1: I don't think people were like coming off like.

580
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:20,754
Speaker 1: this is like the greatest show ever.

581
00:35:20,774 --> 00:35:22,421
Speaker 1: It weren't coming off like.

582
00:35:22,461 --> 00:35:23,525
Speaker 1: this is a masterpiece.

583
00:35:23,946 --> 00:35:25,091
Speaker 1: It was just coming off like.

584
00:35:25,452 --> 00:35:29,026
Speaker 1: this is really popular, like the same- You know what it is?

585
00:35:29,046 --> 00:35:33,692
Speaker 0: This is the kind of show like straight up, and Scott and I actually said the same thing kind of at each other when we first watched it.

586
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:44,896
Speaker 0: This is the kind of show, when we were running the RIT Anime Club, when we found out what it was and watched a little bit of it, we would have instantly just made it the next screening at the anime club.

587
00:35:45,157 --> 00:35:50,232
Speaker 0: because this is the kind of like basic, solid B-level, like B-tier anime.

588
00:35:50,513 --> 00:35:51,336
Speaker 0: that's pretty good.

589
00:35:51,637 --> 00:35:52,460
Speaker 0: People enjoy it.

590
00:35:52,701 --> 00:35:54,527
Speaker 0: It would definitely get the crowd riled up.

591
00:35:54,908 --> 00:36:02,533
Speaker 0: We already can see like specific characters and specific things that would get quoted by the nerds who would watch a show like this.

592
00:36:02,854 --> 00:36:05,663
Speaker 0: It's just a solid, overall okay anime.

593
00:36:05,944 --> 00:36:13,187
Speaker 0: that's kind of funny, kind of serious, well animated, like it checks all the boxes, but it's not great in any particular domain.

594
00:36:13,207 --> 00:36:16,538
Speaker 1: Well I think what it is is that it's a crowd pleaser, right?

595
00:36:16,598 --> 00:36:16,919
Speaker 1: It's like.

596
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,855
Speaker 1: it's just, you know, it's not fan service-y in a sexual way.

597
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:25,026
Speaker 1: There's nothing sexual about this show pretty much whatsoever, right?

598
00:36:25,969 --> 00:36:34,437
Speaker 1: But it's fan service-y as like playing to the crowd, like just like, you know, having cool anime people doing cool anime stuff, right?

599
00:36:34,517 --> 00:36:38,089
Speaker 1: And they've got every different flavor of cool anime stuff going on.

600
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:38,611
Speaker 0: Yeah.

601
00:36:38,631 --> 00:36:44,875
Speaker 1: So if you're an anime fan or just, you know, I think even a non-anime fan, it's like it's just kind of fun, right?

602
00:36:44,935 --> 00:36:49,072
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, it's not gonna, it doesn't challenge the audience or anything like that.

603
00:36:49,193 --> 00:36:50,437
Speaker 1: It's just a whole lot of fun.

604
00:36:50,878 --> 00:36:53,125
Speaker 1: It's a perfect anime club kind of show.

605
00:36:53,145 --> 00:37:02,760
Speaker 1: I don't, I can't imagine someone watching it and like disliking it or not having a good time or not being, you know, happy or entertained.

606
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,765
Speaker 1: That would be weird, right?

607
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:06,817
Speaker 1: Cause it's just like, you know, it's like, it's like sugar, right?

608
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:08,624
Speaker 1: It's like cookies.

609
00:37:09,005 --> 00:37:10,230
Speaker 1: So what's the deal with this show?

610
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:12,719
Speaker 1: Well, the title sort of gives it away, right?

611
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:23,371
Speaker 1: You gotta imagine from the title, there's a spy and the spy has a family or it's like, one of my guesses with the spy has to make a family for a mission.

612
00:37:23,411 --> 00:37:24,978
Speaker 1: It's like, yes, that's exactly what it is.

613
00:37:25,058 --> 00:37:25,279
Speaker 0: Yep.

614
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,364
Speaker 0: That's pretty much that.

615
00:37:26,846 --> 00:37:34,428
Speaker 1: And there's a guy who's a spy and for some, you know, uh, generic European ish country, right?

616
00:37:34,769 --> 00:37:34,929
Speaker 0: Yeah.

617
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:43,907
Speaker 0: There's what there's, there's basically, there's two countries, west and east and it's vague and they are, it's obviously west and east Germany without saying Germany.

618
00:37:43,967 --> 00:37:48,081
Speaker 0: And there's definitely a cold war going on and there's spies all over the place.

619
00:37:48,101 --> 00:37:52,414
Speaker 0: You get the impression that this place is just lousy with spies.

620
00:37:52,434 --> 00:37:54,359
Speaker 0: Yep.

621
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:58,250
Speaker 1: And there's, this guy's the best over, he's the best spy, right?

622
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:04,850
Speaker 1: Like the absolute best spy, like, you know, anime, you know, ridiculous levels of power at spying.

623
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:05,511
Speaker 0: Yep.

624
00:38:05,551 --> 00:38:06,413
Speaker 0: Agent Twilight.

625
00:38:06,674 --> 00:38:10,605
Speaker 0: He's like the hot anime guy, master of disguise.

626
00:38:10,805 --> 00:38:16,263
Speaker 1: Like an absolute genius, perfect skills, perfect disguises, never fails, right?

627
00:38:16,283 --> 00:38:17,367
Speaker 1: It could take anyone.

628
00:38:17,387 --> 00:38:20,682
Speaker 1: It's just like, even better, like James Bond like gets beat up.

629
00:38:20,743 --> 00:38:21,969
Speaker 1: It's like, this guy doesn't really know.

630
00:38:21,989 --> 00:38:31,210
Speaker 0: This guy takes out what he fights those goons in the art theft thing that he's doing a few episodes in and he's just like, I can't spend more than 10 seconds per guy that I'm about to beat up.

631
00:38:31,451 --> 00:38:32,134
Speaker 0: There's 38 of them.

632
00:38:32,837 --> 00:38:33,018
Speaker 1: Yeah.

633
00:38:33,038 --> 00:38:38,902
Speaker 1: It's like Kenshiro levels of power, but obviously a different, much different personality and tone than this to the North star.

634
00:38:38,962 --> 00:38:39,685
Speaker 0: Yep.

635
00:38:39,926 --> 00:38:51,367
Speaker 1: And so this guy has a mission, but in order to do the mission, he has to write, there's a prestigious boarding type, you know, school, which reeks of like a princess tutu tena kind of place.

636
00:38:51,387 --> 00:38:52,210
Speaker 0: There's no allegory.

637
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,619
Speaker 0: It's not going to do anything clever with this.

638
00:38:53,659 --> 00:38:55,310
Speaker 0: Like don't misinterpret what I'm saying.

639
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:55,890
Speaker 1: Yeah.

640
00:38:55,911 --> 00:39:01,110
Speaker 1: It's just a rich, it's just a really, really high brows, snooty, rich people's school.

641
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:17,558
Speaker 0: But to an insane anime degree, like it is, if the spy stuff is unrealistic and the fights and things are unrealistic in an anime way, the university is like double unrealistic in terms of how it's portrayed and how it's structured.

642
00:39:18,221 --> 00:39:18,482
Speaker 1: Yes.

643
00:39:19,205 --> 00:39:22,978
Speaker 1: And he has to basically, you know, it's a contrived scenario, right?

644
00:39:22,998 --> 00:39:30,261
Speaker 1: We has to get into this school, which means he needs a child and, you know, possibly a spouse, right?

645
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:35,319
Speaker 1: To sort of, you know, go to the school interview, get the child accepted to the school.

646
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:42,825
Speaker 1: The child has the past, the, you know, the, the very, very rigorous, you know, examinations and application barriers, right?

647
00:39:43,126 --> 00:39:51,112
Speaker 1: Him and the spouse have to, you know, pass muster and convince the school that they are of, you know, high class, right?

648
00:39:51,192 --> 00:39:51,935
Speaker 1: Individuals.

649
00:39:52,998 --> 00:39:55,666
Speaker 1: And he doesn't have a spouse or a child, right?

650
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,611
Speaker 0: Nor is he interested in one at this point.

651
00:39:58,353 --> 00:39:58,513
Speaker 1: No.

652
00:40:00,438 --> 00:40:04,849
Speaker 1: So I guess spoilers for the earliest parts of the show, right?

653
00:40:05,049 --> 00:40:07,259
Speaker 1: It kind of needs to spoil this to talk about anything.

654
00:40:07,299 --> 00:40:12,664
Speaker 0: Because there is a little twist to this concept because he finds a wife, a fake wife and they get together.

655
00:40:12,684 --> 00:40:27,892
Speaker 1: First, he goes to the orphanage to get a child and he ends up with this very cute daughter who, unbeknownst to him, and I still don't know if or when he ever finds out, the daughter is literally telepathic, like literally.

656
00:40:28,033 --> 00:40:31,344
Speaker 1: She could just hear everyone's thoughts, right?

657
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:35,580
Speaker 1: She can't go to crowded places because it's too, you know, too many thoughts, right?

658
00:40:36,262 --> 00:40:40,478
Speaker 1: And she's really cute and she's not that smart, but she has telepathy.

659
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:42,506
Speaker 1: So that makes up for not being so smart.

660
00:40:42,848 --> 00:40:44,576
Speaker 0: And they animate, like she's just adorable.

661
00:40:44,616 --> 00:40:45,480
Speaker 0: They animate her great.

662
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,549
Speaker 0: She's a really funny character.

663
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:49,076
Speaker 0: Like, it's all very well done around her.

664
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:49,920
Speaker 1: Yep.

665
00:40:50,021 --> 00:40:51,990
Speaker 1: And then it's like, okay, what about the spouse?

666
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:59,935
Speaker 1: So there's this, you know, this woman and she's working in some kind of government office or something, right?

667
00:41:00,537 --> 00:41:06,880
Speaker 1: And she's very serious and separate from all the other coworkers, but secretly she's an ultimate badass assassin.

668
00:41:07,702 --> 00:41:09,027
Speaker 0: She just murders people.

669
00:41:09,087 --> 00:41:11,636
Speaker 0: It is implied she has killed a lot of people.

670
00:41:12,258 --> 00:41:18,281
Speaker 0: And what's funny is up until the point where you see her doing her job, you don't really see people like dying in the show.

671
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:20,050
Speaker 0: Like it's kind of like off-screen stuff.

672
00:41:20,591 --> 00:41:25,447
Speaker 0: She shows up and just stabs like eight people in her opening scene almost.

673
00:41:25,487 --> 00:41:28,177
Speaker 1: She's like, she's literally ultra dangerous assassin.

674
00:41:28,197 --> 00:41:31,590
Speaker 1: She's as good at assassinating as the spy dude is at spying.

675
00:41:31,931 --> 00:41:34,238
Speaker 1: Just ultimately unbelievable, right?

676
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:40,279
Speaker 1: But you know, at work, she's very serious and boring, when she's assassinating, she's ultra badass.

677
00:41:40,621 --> 00:41:40,882
Speaker 1: Right.

678
00:41:41,243 --> 00:41:44,355
Speaker 1: And then, you know, when she's just hanging out, she's kind of cute.

679
00:41:44,375 --> 00:41:51,481
Speaker 1: So you sort of get this, you know, appealing character through having wildly divergent personalities at different times.

680
00:41:51,782 --> 00:41:52,304
Speaker 1: Right.

681
00:41:52,344 --> 00:42:04,515
Speaker 0: I didn't expect that was interesting is they, they made her like, not just an assassin, but like extremely obsessed with and enamored with the artifacts of violence.

682
00:42:04,596 --> 00:42:12,033
Speaker 0: Like she almost seems like horny for a sharp knife or a photo of a guillotine.

683
00:42:12,313 --> 00:42:14,379
Speaker 0: Like it is, that's her thing.

684
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,426
Speaker 0: Like she is, she's just mega assassin.

685
00:42:16,927 --> 00:42:21,764
Speaker 1: And so they mysteriously, you know, uh, she takes orders from her brother.

686
00:42:22,005 --> 00:42:22,206
Speaker 1: Right.

687
00:42:22,246 --> 00:42:24,333
Speaker 1: And she basically goes only into assassin mode.

688
00:42:24,394 --> 00:42:31,496
Speaker 1: when, you know, the brother sends some orders and, you know, she, it's like they get into other situations.

689
00:42:32,057 --> 00:42:34,566
Speaker 1: Um, but they're not related to her mission.

690
00:42:34,626 --> 00:42:36,996
Speaker 1: So she just goes along with, you know, right.

691
00:42:37,016 --> 00:42:40,192
Speaker 1: The spy dude who doesn't know she's an assassin and she doesn't know he's a spy.

692
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:42,361
Speaker 0: So the little girl, that's neither of them.

693
00:42:42,562 --> 00:42:43,145
Speaker 1: No, the girl is.

694
00:42:43,205 --> 00:42:49,493
Speaker 0: And that's the twist that makes the show actually pretty funny and like makes it work is that it's not the, it's not like the true spies movie.

695
00:42:49,513 --> 00:42:50,096
Speaker 0: where they like.

696
00:42:50,477 --> 00:42:53,109
Speaker 0: the plot is when do they figure it out about each other?

697
00:42:53,149 --> 00:42:54,695
Speaker 0: and what are they hiding or all that kind of nonsense.

698
00:42:54,735 --> 00:42:58,853
Speaker 0: This is more like they are actually completely hiding it from each other.

699
00:42:58,933 --> 00:43:00,862
Speaker 0: They both have the other one completely fooled.

700
00:43:00,882 --> 00:43:08,671
Speaker 0: And meanwhile, the little girl knows the full deal with both of them, but simultaneously doesn't want them to know she's psychic.

701
00:43:08,952 --> 00:43:10,256
Speaker 0: So she doesn't let on.

702
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:11,540
Speaker 1: Yep.

703
00:43:12,002 --> 00:43:27,187
Speaker 1: And then of course the final thing, which, you know, this isn't a spoiler because I don't know, I've only seen five episodes, but you would have to be really bad at, you know, looking for, you know, uh, uh, oh, their mission definitely overlaps.

704
00:43:27,207 --> 00:43:29,716
Speaker 0: They're the same guy, right?

705
00:43:29,957 --> 00:43:41,430
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, her, they keep, you know, whenever they show her brother, it's always like, she's talking to him on the phone and they'll cut to like a photo of the brother, but his face will be like hidden, like some, you know, some someone's wiener,

706
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:41,750
Speaker 0: telling

707
00:43:41,771 --> 00:43:42,974
Speaker 1: you and a cucumber,

708
00:43:43,035 --> 00:43:43,255
Speaker 0: right?

709
00:43:43,316 --> 00:43:46,727
Speaker 0: Standard anime doing all that like basic shit.

710
00:43:46,927 --> 00:43:50,801
Speaker 1: It's obvious that the main spy dude's mission is to get the brother.

711
00:43:50,901 --> 00:43:57,646
Speaker 1: And at the end of the season or whatever, there's a conflict where he's trying to get the brother and you're right.

712
00:43:57,706 --> 00:44:01,159
Speaker 1: And now he's a, you know, they have to fight with each other and sort things out.

713
00:44:01,379 --> 00:44:07,041
Speaker 0: I imagine the psychic girl is going to be the one who like allows them to sort this out.

714
00:44:07,081 --> 00:44:08,628
Speaker 0: Like that's clearly where the show is going.

715
00:44:08,648 --> 00:44:10,073
Speaker 0: The only thing I can't predict.

716
00:44:10,094 --> 00:44:15,274
Speaker 1: the fact that the plot is so transparent doesn't matter because that's not why you're watching the show.

717
00:44:15,314 --> 00:44:32,770
Speaker 0: That is just a vehicle for like scenes where they go to apply to the university and an utenna like animal stampede happens and the headmaster is secretly watching them to decide if their child deserves to be in this prestigious academy for six year olds.

718
00:44:34,211 --> 00:44:40,498
Speaker 1: Yeah, the reason you watch this show is because every episode they've got to take the next step in, you know, their mission or whatever.

719
00:44:40,779 --> 00:44:47,056
Speaker 1: And they come into some ridiculous circumstance that's truly off the wall and wild.

720
00:44:47,517 --> 00:44:47,798
Speaker 1: Right.

721
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:58,670
Speaker 1: And they comedically and entertainingly, you know, overcome all these various challenges in ridiculous and entertaining anime style.

722
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:01,922
Speaker 1: Like when their clothes get dirty three times, it's like, aha.

723
00:45:01,983 --> 00:45:04,292
Speaker 1: But they brought a third set of clothing.

724
00:45:04,533 --> 00:45:05,376
Speaker 0: And then Mr.

725
00:45:05,457 --> 00:45:07,565
Speaker 0: Elegant is like, oh, that's beyond elegant.

726
00:45:07,605 --> 00:45:08,850
Speaker 0: That's terrifying.

727
00:45:09,811 --> 00:45:14,488
Speaker 1: I got to get this girl in the anime face like, oh, you know, right.

728
00:45:14,528 --> 00:45:14,628
Speaker 0: Yeah.

729
00:45:14,668 --> 00:45:24,412
Speaker 0: I'll tell you, if we showed this, if you showed this to any anime club for at least two weeks, you're going to have kids running around to your club going elegant, elegant and yelling at each other.

730
00:45:24,432 --> 00:45:25,777
Speaker 0: That's just how it's going to go down.

731
00:45:27,482 --> 00:45:29,730
Speaker 1: So it's like, you know, the scenario.

732
00:45:29,971 --> 00:45:32,719
Speaker 1: anime is kind of thing as we go on for a while.

733
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:33,221
Speaker 1: Right.

734
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:38,341
Speaker 1: But this particular scenario is somewhat unique and clever and well thought out.

735
00:45:38,542 --> 00:45:38,784
Speaker 1: Right.

736
00:45:38,844 --> 00:45:40,050
Speaker 1: And I think that helps it a lot.

737
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:41,374
Speaker 0: It's legitimately funny.

738
00:45:41,394 --> 00:45:42,418
Speaker 0: All right.

739
00:45:42,799 --> 00:45:50,343
Speaker 1: And then despite being very cliche and leaning heavily into the anime tropes, it executes them very well.

740
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:50,925
Speaker 1: Right.

741
00:45:51,065 --> 00:45:52,450
Speaker 1: It's not, you know, it's not.

742
00:45:53,991 --> 00:45:55,837
Speaker 1: it's well animated, at least for what it is.

743
00:45:56,138 --> 00:45:56,379
Speaker 1: Right.

744
00:45:56,539 --> 00:45:57,362
Speaker 1: Yeah.

745
00:45:58,064 --> 00:46:01,577
Speaker 0: You know, it's doing the thing with like a bunch of.

746
00:46:01,798 --> 00:46:07,244
Speaker 0: there's a set of side characters and you get the impression they're introduced more of them as time goes on, like not just Mr.

747
00:46:07,304 --> 00:46:12,422
Speaker 0: Elegant, but like the fuzzy haired sidekick to the fuzzy haired spy guy.

748
00:46:12,442 --> 00:46:12,683
Speaker 1: Yeah.

749
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:21,116
Speaker 0: They got like the weird looking background characters that younger anime fans like to low key obsess over, which is the thing anime fans have always done in America.

750
00:46:21,156 --> 00:46:32,718
Speaker 1: And I think that's another strength of this show is that, you know, you see a lot of anime where there's a whole bunch of characters and it's typical, I think, for main characters to sort of be boring.

751
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:33,481
Speaker 1: Right.

752
00:46:33,882 --> 00:46:38,337
Speaker 1: And not have a lot of, you know, wild, different personality or anything.

753
00:46:38,397 --> 00:46:38,719
Speaker 1: Yeah.

754
00:46:38,739 --> 00:46:41,773
Speaker 1: Like supposed to be ultra relatable, like blank slate kind of deal.

755
00:46:41,873 --> 00:46:45,106
Speaker 1: And all the side characters are interesting and awesome.

756
00:46:45,147 --> 00:46:49,567
Speaker 1: Whereas in this show, every character is interesting and awesome and some and different in it.

757
00:46:49,648 --> 00:46:51,636
Speaker 1: It's like all side characters, basically.

758
00:46:51,676 --> 00:46:51,957
Speaker 1: Yeah.

759
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:57,781
Speaker 0: Like you get the jerk guy who works for the school, who's like, I don't like these people because they're young and hot.

760
00:46:57,841 --> 00:47:00,512
Speaker 0: So fuck them and make sure the kid doesn't get into the school.

761
00:47:00,532 --> 00:47:00,592
Speaker 0: Yep.

762
00:47:01,495 --> 00:47:04,042
Speaker 1: But the kid gets in anyways.

763
00:47:04,143 --> 00:47:04,524
Speaker 0: Yeah.

764
00:47:04,724 --> 00:47:05,045
Speaker 0: You did.

765
00:47:05,446 --> 00:47:09,384
Speaker 1: I, this is not a show where you're watching it because you don't know what's going to happen.

766
00:47:09,465 --> 00:47:13,444
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, what's going to happen from episode one if you're an adult.

767
00:47:13,866 --> 00:47:24,881
Speaker 0: And the other thing, you know, we've seen things, it really does check all the boxes of a solid, typical upper echelon, but not great or memorable anime like the opener.

768
00:47:25,403 --> 00:47:26,145
Speaker 0: Fantastic.

769
00:47:26,225 --> 00:47:28,493
Speaker 0: Like as a really good opener, the closer is cute.

770
00:47:28,855 --> 00:47:34,415
Speaker 0: The opener and closer are like stereotypical standard anime opener and closer for this kind of show.

771
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:43,263
Speaker 0: It is just everything is done adequately, but nothing is done to any sort of like, um, like S tier or memorable degree.

772
00:47:43,785 --> 00:47:43,945
Speaker 1: Yeah.

773
00:47:44,366 --> 00:47:44,527
Speaker 1: Yeah.

774
00:47:44,547 --> 00:47:50,492
Speaker 1: So I think like if you're a younger anime fan or you're an anime fan who has someone to watch the show with, you should definitely do that.

775
00:47:50,632 --> 00:47:58,996
Speaker 1: If you're an older anime fan, I guess, you know, you don't have to run out and need a show to fill some time.

776
00:47:59,398 --> 00:48:01,507
Speaker 1: You could do a lot worse because it's scratched.

777
00:48:01,648 --> 00:48:08,787
Speaker 0: I'm not going to, I don't think I'm going to watch it all anytime soon, but I might occasionally watch an episode and kind of go a little bit beyond where I watch because it scratched an itch.

778
00:48:08,827 --> 00:48:11,721
Speaker 0: that hasn't been scratched for me in a while because now we're older.

779
00:48:12,063 --> 00:48:13,329
Speaker 0: We don't watch as much anime.

780
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:15,115
Speaker 0: We're much more selective about what we watch.

781
00:48:15,596 --> 00:48:25,187
Speaker 0: And the thing that this show did for me is I watched one episode and it's scratched that itch of, Hey, you want to watch an anime?

782
00:48:25,327 --> 00:48:26,792
Speaker 0: Like, Hey, want to see some anime kid?

783
00:48:27,133 --> 00:48:27,916
Speaker 0: It just scratched that.

784
00:48:27,976 --> 00:48:33,898
Speaker 0: It should felt like how I felt when I watched a typical anime a long time ago when I was younger.

785
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:41,225
Speaker 0: Cause usually when I watch a show, I'm only watching a show that like has accolades or like there's some specific reason to watch it.

786
00:48:41,606 --> 00:48:44,619
Speaker 0: Like cyberpunk is going to be very different type of show and type of review.

787
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:49,739
Speaker 0: And I'm going to watch it, approach it and enjoy it in a very different way from like this kind of show.

788
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:56,763
Speaker 1: Now I am curious about the manga for this, which I believe still going, I guess, and is still going.

789
00:48:56,783 --> 00:48:59,713
Speaker 1: And the show is now going to have a second season.

790
00:48:59,753 --> 00:49:05,492
Speaker 1: So I'm curious if a, is the plot resolution going to be resolved at the end of season one?

791
00:49:05,773 --> 00:49:07,661
Speaker 1: Will there be a new plot, right?

792
00:49:07,702 --> 00:49:08,786
Speaker 1: Like what's going to happen?

793
00:49:08,806 --> 00:49:09,891
Speaker 1: I'm just guessing here, right?

794
00:49:09,931 --> 00:49:10,875
Speaker 1: Not, it's not a spoiler.

795
00:49:10,895 --> 00:49:25,536
Speaker 1: if I'm just guessing based on common logic, uh, you know, they realize they, everyone realizes the truth and that, you know, they started out doing this as a business arrangement, but actually, uh, they end up loving each other and wanting to stay together as a family.

796
00:49:25,556 --> 00:49:29,231
Speaker 1: And season two is what they're the awesome family who now knows everything.

797
00:49:29,271 --> 00:49:41,150
Speaker 0: Now, if I had to guess, I would guess that they figure out the girl is psychic as part of the resolution of the first plot, which if I would assume is going to be the end of season one.

798
00:49:41,531 --> 00:49:43,439
Speaker 0: And then season two probably picks up with.

799
00:49:43,721 --> 00:49:45,408
Speaker 0: the three of them know each other's deal.

800
00:49:45,488 --> 00:49:54,202
Speaker 1: And now it's against the world, but openly, like they're all now, now they're no longer just, I think like in their minds in the, you know, in the first season, right.

801
00:49:54,262 --> 00:49:58,119
Speaker 1: It's like they entered into this relationship with each other for their own reasons.

802
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:04,565
Speaker 0: Oh, they already gave us the scene in episode like two or three where Twilight like watches the two of them interacting.

803
00:50:04,606 --> 00:50:10,427
Speaker 0: And he just has this moment where he's like, ah, and he like looks at another family that are being happy.

804
00:50:10,447 --> 00:50:12,777
Speaker 0: And you can see a hundred percent where the show is going from that.

805
00:50:13,279 --> 00:50:14,203
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.

806
00:50:14,283 --> 00:50:14,464
Speaker 1: Right.

807
00:50:14,565 --> 00:50:16,312
Speaker 1: It's like he did this just for his mission.

808
00:50:16,774 --> 00:50:17,859
Speaker 1: She did this for what?

809
00:50:17,899 --> 00:50:21,674
Speaker 1: Like, you know, because she had trouble with her friends at that party or something.

810
00:50:21,734 --> 00:50:23,019
Speaker 1: Right.

811
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:27,696
Speaker 1: The coworkers, he needed to bring a boyfriend to the party to show them what to what for.

812
00:50:28,197 --> 00:50:32,534
Speaker 1: And obviously the girl is doing this because, you know, she doesn't go back to the orphanage.

813
00:50:32,594 --> 00:50:32,715
Speaker 1: Right.

814
00:50:32,735 --> 00:50:33,962
Speaker 1: And she likes them as parents.

815
00:50:34,022 --> 00:50:34,525
Speaker 1: Yes.

816
00:50:34,565 --> 00:50:35,450
Speaker 1: Finally got some good parents.

817
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:36,413
Speaker 0: I got cool parents.

818
00:50:36,654 --> 00:50:37,699
Speaker 0: One of them's an assassin.

819
00:50:37,759 --> 00:50:38,503
Speaker 0: One of them's a spy.

820
00:50:38,643 --> 00:50:39,166
Speaker 0: Fuck yeah.

821
00:50:39,186 --> 00:50:41,394
Speaker 0: Cause she's into spy shows.

822
00:50:42,097 --> 00:50:42,378
Speaker 1: Right.

823
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:52,714
Speaker 1: And so, you know, everyone's in this arrangement for their own reason, but obviously, you know, they're going to grow into actually all loving each other as a family and staying together.

824
00:50:52,734 --> 00:50:53,216
Speaker 1: Right.

825
00:50:53,256 --> 00:50:53,798
Speaker 1: Surprise.

826
00:50:53,999 --> 00:50:55,866
Speaker 1: That's a hundred percent guaranteed to happen.

827
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:56,569
Speaker 1: Right.

828
00:50:56,790 --> 00:51:01,731
Speaker 1: So if all that stuff happens in season one and the manga keeps going and the anime keeps going, right.

829
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:11,424
Speaker 1: You got to presume that either a not all of those things happen so quickly or B they go onto some other, you know, plot where the family is together.

830
00:51:11,464 --> 00:51:14,156
Speaker 1: They all understand each other and they have another challenge.

831
00:51:14,659 --> 00:51:15,181
Speaker 1: Some conflict.

832
00:51:15,201 --> 00:51:15,845
Speaker 0: I feel like getting you.

833
00:51:15,865 --> 00:51:19,903
Speaker 0: that point would be important because then that unlock, like right now there's a lot of jokes around.

834
00:51:20,425 --> 00:51:23,278
Speaker 0: You've got a tall little girl, a precocious little girl.

835
00:51:23,338 --> 00:51:25,810
Speaker 0: Who's honestly kind of like, she's, she's dumb like a kid.

836
00:51:26,191 --> 00:51:32,230
Speaker 0: That's why your kids because he has stupid, but because she's psychic, she can kind of fake it.

837
00:51:32,832 --> 00:51:38,478
Speaker 0: And like her interactions with adults because of the fact that she's psychic are actually surprising and funny.

838
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:42,893
Speaker 0: But I think the next evolution of that is the parents know she's psychic.

839
00:51:43,334 --> 00:51:45,882
Speaker 0: How the fuck do they parent her now knowing this?

840
00:51:47,086 --> 00:51:47,267
Speaker 1: Right.

841
00:51:47,287 --> 00:51:50,221
Speaker 1: Well, you know, I think it helps that she's kind of, she's not bad.

842
00:51:50,241 --> 00:51:50,723
Speaker 0: Yeah.

843
00:51:50,763 --> 00:51:51,467
Speaker 0: She's definitely not bad.

844
00:51:51,527 --> 00:51:53,074
Speaker 0: She's, she's, she's a good girl.

845
00:51:53,315 --> 00:51:54,037
Speaker 0: Do it, do it.

846
00:51:54,118 --> 00:51:54,920
Speaker 0: Trying to do good.

847
00:51:56,085 --> 00:51:57,832
Speaker 1: I think it would also be kind of awesome, right?

848
00:51:57,892 --> 00:52:02,960
Speaker 1: It's like once they know it, they'll do some kind of spy mission and they'll be like, Hey, go listen to that guy's thoughts.

849
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:03,905
Speaker 1: Tell me what you think.

850
00:52:03,925 --> 00:52:05,352
Speaker 0: You imagine the loss of situations.

851
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:16,254
Speaker 0: Like, Hey, we're, uh, we're a husband and wife and we figured out our deal and we want to go have some, some alone times, but we can't think about that while our daughter's within like a kilometer of us,

852
00:52:16,696 --> 00:52:20,673
Speaker 1: you know, they could make another, they could make a biological baby between them.

853
00:52:20,934 --> 00:52:21,255
Speaker 1: Right.

854
00:52:21,376 --> 00:52:29,383
Speaker 1: And then, uh, you can get some pregnant assassin action and you could, you know, uh, uh, you know, what season two might be, no blood.

855
00:52:29,784 --> 00:52:37,134
Speaker 0: It might be figure out the origin of her psychic powers to protect her from the plot that predates the show of, you know, she was part of an experiment.

856
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,360
Speaker 0: Like where did she get her powers from?

857
00:52:38,661 --> 00:52:47,213
Speaker 0: Whereas, and there was a character who looked like a redheaded woman, I think in the opener who was stylized that looked like she was spying on the family.

858
00:52:47,233 --> 00:52:53,755
Speaker 0: I wonder if that's her real mom or like the scientists that made her or like, there's, there's something there.

859
00:52:54,177 --> 00:52:57,970
Speaker 0: If that's in the opener that might come up in season one.

860
00:52:59,172 --> 00:53:08,710
Speaker 1: The point is it's not hard to carry this scenario on for quite a while, as long as they're still making money and their show is making money, they're selling mangas, they're selling merch.

861
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:17,804
Speaker 0: I mean, I can't stress enough how this show flooded my social media, like for a couple months after it came out and I still see random people just talk about it.

862
00:53:17,824 --> 00:53:29,297
Speaker 1: I see fan arts, I see, you know, I see memes and you know, so yeah, it's, it's a, it's a hot new, new, not too new, newer anime manga.

863
00:53:29,338 --> 00:53:29,840
Speaker 0: I mean, it's from 2022.

864
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:30,603
Speaker 0: It's, uh, it's new to geek nights.

865
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:34,434
Speaker 1: It's a, it's a fun time.

866
00:53:35,096 --> 00:53:39,248
Speaker 1: Um, it's just not a legendary great anime of all time.

867
00:53:39,269 --> 00:53:39,529
Speaker 1: Yeah.

868
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:43,789
Speaker 0: So if you already got a crunchy roll account, there's no reason not to watch a few episodes of this.

869
00:53:44,751 --> 00:53:44,912
Speaker 0: Yeah.

870
00:53:45,214 --> 00:53:47,930
Speaker 0: I would not buy a crunchy roll account just to watch this, however.

871
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:51,887
