Speaker 0: Wow I've owned by one minute.

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,353
Speaker 1: I pulled into the train station as the train was pulling out.

15
00:00:58,413 --> 00:01:00,744
Speaker 1: if I hadn't brought back the trash cans I would have made it.

16
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:01,830
Speaker 0: You know I've now.

17
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,679
Speaker 0: I've only once missed a train.

18
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, at least for work, so I just hung out at the train station listen to my iPod whatever.

19
00:01:09,081 --> 00:01:12,732
Speaker 0: Yeah, see I got on my train and on my laptop, and I was laying there.

20
00:01:13,254 --> 00:01:16,528
Speaker 0: There's this big fat guy Behind the seat.

21
00:01:16,568 --> 00:01:18,280
Speaker 0: I was gonna sit in like he was big enough.

22
00:01:18,481 --> 00:01:23,860
Speaker 0: I'm curious how he got in the door because he took up two whole seats like fully.

23
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:28,677
Speaker 0: He might have taken the double doors he might have and uh alright bad guy.

24
00:01:28,998 --> 00:01:36,098
Speaker 0: No big deal There's a seat in front of him, so I'll just sit there and and then about 20 minutes in the train ride I hear a choking sound followed by.

25
00:01:41,918 --> 00:01:42,688
Speaker 1: That's just wonderful.

26
00:01:44,073 --> 00:01:45,022
Speaker 1: All right, you can stop that.

27
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:49,926
Speaker 1: now You're wasting time in the back got worse and worse and any like fun.

28
00:01:49,946 --> 00:01:50,930
Speaker 1: She's moved to another car.

29
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:51,454
Speaker 0: Oh, I left.

30
00:01:51,514 --> 00:01:52,158
Speaker 0: I left the car.

31
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:53,608
Speaker 0: okay, so did a bunch of other people.

32
00:01:53,669 --> 00:01:59,725
Speaker 0: yeah But I tell you what if I were a conductor I would have woken that guy up every time I walked by him on the way home.

33
00:01:59,806 --> 00:02:00,750
Speaker 1: the guy sitting next to me.

34
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,530
Speaker 1: He wasn't a bad guy, but he smelled like fast-food grease something fierce.

35
00:02:05,771 --> 00:02:10,110
Speaker 1: I couldn't tell if he worked in a fast food, or if he just had just eaten it and gotten all over himself.

36
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:14,609
Speaker 0: I could not tell the economy is definitely not bad enough to where McDonald's workers are commuting in.

37
00:02:14,809 --> 00:02:15,994
Speaker 1: no But I smelled man.

38
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,825
Speaker 1: the economy could never be good enough.

39
00:02:18,866 --> 00:02:26,507
Speaker 1: then McDonald's commute in but Yeah, he smelled like fast food all the whole way, and it was kind of sickening.

40
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:31,929
Speaker 0: well I think the economy either has to be really really good or really really bad for the fast-food workers to commute in.

41
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:32,956
Speaker 0: there's no middle ground there.

42
00:02:32,977 --> 00:02:42,269
Speaker 1: I Guess yeah Cuz if it was really bad their meager Fast-food incomes would be enough to pay for a commute because the commute price would be so low and money be so valuable.

43
00:02:42,289 --> 00:02:54,174
Speaker 0: yeah At the same time if real estate is still so bad in the city which even when the city turns to shit real estate still Crazy there, or if the economy was so great then fast-food workers are making a bajillion dollars And they could afford to commute.

44
00:02:54,435 --> 00:02:57,006
Speaker 0: or we have Monaco or Monica could have.

45
00:02:57,066 --> 00:02:58,110
Speaker 1: Monica could have Monica.

46
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,417
Speaker 0: I'll tell you what if we have Monaco.

47
00:02:59,678 --> 00:03:00,563
Speaker 0: if I'm not in New York.

48
00:03:00,603 --> 00:03:01,106
Speaker 0: I'm out of here.

49
00:03:01,226 --> 00:03:01,769
Speaker 1: That's true.

50
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:05,623
Speaker 1: Anyway, oh, so what other crazy should have?

51
00:03:05,663 --> 00:03:07,250
Speaker 1: Smash Brothers came in the mail today.

52
00:03:13,452 --> 00:03:16,986
Speaker 0: Yeah, just kidding as much as we want to play We're gonna hold out at least until we finish.

53
00:03:17,006 --> 00:03:20,290
Speaker 1: yeah Yeah, you probably thought you were clever fooling everyone like that.

54
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:20,631
Speaker 1: But they're.

55
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:24,370
Speaker 1: they can all look at their iPods and see this podcast is plenty of time left.

56
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:25,716
Speaker 0: You know most people don't.

57
00:03:25,737 --> 00:03:28,570
Speaker 0: I know how people listen to their iPods, and I know I listen to my iPod.

58
00:03:29,153 --> 00:03:33,855
Speaker 0: I just hit play on a playlist, and I'm just sitting there, and I'm just listening And I don't look.

59
00:03:33,915 --> 00:03:34,959
Speaker 0: I don't see my iPod.

60
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:37,269
Speaker 0: my iPod is away and possibly locked.

61
00:03:37,953 --> 00:03:44,669
Speaker 1: See I actually when it is away and locked But if I hear the end of a podcast I get my iPod out and to switch it up.

62
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:48,014
Speaker 1: and Usually a lot of podcast the ending shit I don't want to listen to.

63
00:03:48,074 --> 00:03:49,059
Speaker 1: so I'll get ready.

64
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:50,667
Speaker 0: so but what about the stinger?

65
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:58,531
Speaker 1: no But if a podcast ended like started sounded like it was ending prematurely I would take a look to see if it was a broken mp3 where they fuck yeah, but you

66
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:04,974
Speaker 0: forget that there's that that moment that split second where they hear that music and they go ah Those bastards.

67
00:04:05,215 --> 00:04:13,790
Speaker 1: and then they hear me say just kidding before they could look and they go ah right also today at work Like my co-workers weren't there, so it was like there's only four tech workers.

68
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:17,447
Speaker 1: So it was me and the boss and that was it and we're just kind of sitting there like yep.

69
00:04:18,211 --> 00:04:23,695
Speaker 0: A few people didn't handle the DST transition so well no Lot of.

70
00:04:23,996 --> 00:04:40,089
Speaker 0: I called a lot of customers and people to say hey You're gonna connect an hour from now I'm guessing like oh, yeah Oops yeah, also a lot of people just didn't seem to have enough sleep today and TP And it doesn't cut solve that.

71
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,335
Speaker 0: NTP just sets the clock.

72
00:04:42,556 --> 00:04:45,846
Speaker 0: your computer had better handle the time zone.

73
00:04:46,307 --> 00:04:47,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.

74
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,403
Speaker 1: You got to set Etsy local time.

75
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:51,055
Speaker 0: Yeah Symbolic link yes you do.

76
00:04:51,115 --> 00:04:56,490
Speaker 0: and also what if you have some demons or systems that think in GMT which a lot of people do?

77
00:04:57,771 --> 00:05:00,166
Speaker 1: You gotta have Etsy local time set to the right thing.

78
00:05:00,206 --> 00:05:00,649
Speaker 1: so it's a no.

79
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,610
Speaker 0: No, what if everything is in GMT straight up where there is no daylight savings time?

80
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:09,830
Speaker 0: You need to be aware of that and right around that in your software, which a lot of people don't anyway.

81
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:12,678
Speaker 0: Everything should be in GMT.

82
00:05:12,758 --> 00:05:15,129
Speaker 0: computers shouldn't have to care what time it is, but I digress.

83
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:15,894
Speaker 1: well That's the way.

84
00:05:16,056 --> 00:05:17,889
Speaker 1: every that all my computers are is that?

85
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:22,390
Speaker 1: well I guess except for my desktop because it has to reboot to Windows and Windows is stupid as shit.

86
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,536
Speaker 1: But all my Linux only computers.

87
00:05:24,817 --> 00:05:34,778
Speaker 1: the hardware clock is in GMT and the operating system knows what time zone I'm in and it interpolates for any clock Like logs and everything.

88
00:05:34,818 --> 00:05:37,050
Speaker 0: I like to have everything as possible in GMT.

89
00:05:37,294 --> 00:05:39,736
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, definitely But no for any time.

90
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:51,821
Speaker 1: the only time it should translate to a time zone is when someone has to look at the time in Say, you know the clock applet in the yeah only when a human needs to see the exactly Yeah, oh and the governor is in trouble.

91
00:05:52,222 --> 00:05:58,200
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah our man Spitzer You know It amazes me.

92
00:05:58,523 --> 00:06:03,219
Speaker 0: Just how Many people can be so corrupt in our government.

93
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:11,570
Speaker 1: I mean, I mean the governor I lived in Connecticut governor corrupt Governor Roland was corrupt and he got went to jail, right?

94
00:06:12,654 --> 00:06:15,483
Speaker 1: Let's see in New Jersey He was gay.

95
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,410
Speaker 1: So he resigned.

96
00:06:17,956 --> 00:06:19,923
Speaker 1: But it's it's still the governor got in trouble.

97
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:23,112
Speaker 1: New York governor Prostitution.

98
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:24,877
Speaker 1: and we should do a Thursday on prostitution.

99
00:06:24,938 --> 00:06:32,065
Speaker 1: We should do a Thursday on governors that too, but governor in trouble I don't think a lot of you know, are you connecting states governor's in trouble?

100
00:06:32,085 --> 00:06:33,110
Speaker 0: I'm gonna put forth a statement.

101
00:06:33,251 --> 00:06:36,910
Speaker 0: I don't think a lot of our listeners in the US actually know what the governor's duties are.

102
00:06:37,452 --> 00:06:38,476
Speaker 1: I don't think they know either.

103
00:06:38,517 --> 00:06:40,606
Speaker 1: and you know what I'm thinking about this.

104
00:06:40,646 --> 00:06:41,108
Speaker 0: I'm curious.

105
00:06:41,148 --> 00:06:41,610
Speaker 0: I'm curious.

106
00:06:42,331 --> 00:06:43,114
Speaker 0: Answer this in the forum.

107
00:06:43,335 --> 00:06:47,070
Speaker 0: How many of you who live in the United States without looking it up know who your governor is?

108
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,015
Speaker 0: That's all I want to ask.

109
00:06:48,195 --> 00:06:48,356
Speaker 1: Yeah.

110
00:06:48,577 --> 00:06:49,040
Speaker 1: Here's the thing.

111
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,050
Speaker 1: I really want to know as I was trying to think right?

112
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:58,838
Speaker 1: We have listeners that are international right and international listeners probably know about the president of the United States and whatever They may even know about the Congress.

113
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:09,810
Speaker 1: They might know states have governors But like, you know, like Germany has states right and there must be local, you know Governance for the the states of Germany or the states of France.

114
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:17,494
Speaker 0: If you're asking the providences of Canada, if you're asking people to tell us about their local or federalized government structure There's something called Wikipedia.

115
00:07:17,574 --> 00:07:18,015
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

116
00:07:18,076 --> 00:07:19,280
Speaker 1: No, I'm wondering right.

117
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:19,942
Speaker 1: It's like I have.

118
00:07:20,082 --> 00:07:23,632
Speaker 1: I could not name a single like Like.

119
00:07:23,753 --> 00:07:26,103
Speaker 1: who's the the person in charge of Alberta?

120
00:07:26,224 --> 00:07:27,510
Speaker 1: I couldn't I have no clue.

121
00:07:27,851 --> 00:07:29,320
Speaker 1: The person in charge of Ontario.

122
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:34,915
Speaker 0: No, I think it's obvious Scott You really don't know the person in charge of Alberta You're?

123
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,891
Speaker 0: you honestly don't What?

124
00:07:37,051 --> 00:07:41,124
Speaker 1: there's someone who's like the who's the guess the equivalent of governor of?

125
00:07:41,345 --> 00:07:42,829
Speaker 0: obviously it's Prince Albert.

126
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:44,901
Speaker 1: No It's not funny.

127
00:07:44,921 --> 00:07:45,750
Speaker 1: This is stupid.

128
00:07:46,052 --> 00:07:46,636
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

129
00:07:46,676 --> 00:07:49,773
Speaker 1: but you know They probably don't.

130
00:07:49,853 --> 00:07:59,210
Speaker 1: Albert and people in other countries probably have no fucking clue unless they're really smart or they pay really close attention About like the you know, the lower levels of the state and town.

131
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,217
Speaker 1: Honest no, but I think it's really interesting.

132
00:08:03,257 --> 00:08:10,266
Speaker 1: and now I kind of want to know how local and state governments who work in other countries Yeah, and I want them to know about ours Wikipedia.

133
00:08:10,628 --> 00:08:13,354
Speaker 1: Yeah Won't be that complete.

134
00:08:13,374 --> 00:08:14,799
Speaker 1: Wikipedia is u.s.

135
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,050
Speaker 0: Central more so go read the Wikipedia on Germany.

136
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,903
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, but to get the to get the really detailed information.

137
00:08:21,923 --> 00:08:23,990
Speaker 1: I'd have to read the Wikipedia that's written in German.

138
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:27,824
Speaker 1: Really there'd be a lot more information in that one than there would be.

139
00:08:27,844 --> 00:08:38,090
Speaker 0: I suggest you go because most Wikipedia is for countries that people care enough about to write an article about Tend to have an entirely separate page dedicated solely to the minutiae of their governmental structures.

140
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:41,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm just saying I think all the information is there.

141
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:44,230
Speaker 1: I think that in that level of information will be there.

142
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:50,130
Speaker 1: But if I were to say look up Information about like a specific state in a specific town and like what's the situation is there right now?

143
00:08:50,512 --> 00:08:53,010
Speaker 0: I think that would be worse now because that shouldn't even be in Wikipedia.

144
00:08:53,171 --> 00:08:55,410
Speaker 1: Well, a lot of this stuff's in there for the US and Wikipedia.

145
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,624
Speaker 1: They're like not really pages for like every town in the United States and who's the mayor?

146
00:08:59,644 --> 00:09:04,943
Speaker 0: and you realize there's pages for most of The places in France and Britain to to go.

147
00:09:04,983 --> 00:09:05,485
Speaker 1: take a look then.

148
00:09:05,505 --> 00:09:06,167
Speaker 1: that'd be interesting.

149
00:09:06,609 --> 00:09:14,590
Speaker 0: Anyway But yeah, there's there's a bunch of news and I'll talk about this real briefly because I so little needs to be said.

150
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:33,637
Speaker 0: but apparently a Lawmaker Tim couch in a state somewhere some state that doesn't matter at all has Decided that the best way to fix the problems that he is facing In the world today and the people are facing is to ban Anonymity on the internet.

151
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:37,229
Speaker 0: and all I want to say is good luck, sir with that.

152
00:09:38,415 --> 00:09:39,588
Speaker 0: Good luck to you, sir.

153
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:56,678
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know where to begin on that one like I it's very rare that statement by a person Will is able to so succinctly and so clearly convey unto me the fact that they have no Concept of what the internet is.

154
00:09:56,698 --> 00:09:59,190
Speaker 1: you should probably ban steering wheels on cars.

155
00:09:59,371 --> 00:10:00,720
Speaker 1: No steering wheels on the car.

156
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,410
Speaker 0: never use the computer in their lives.

157
00:10:03,171 --> 00:10:06,363
Speaker 1: We should we should ban we should ban wings on airplanes.

158
00:10:06,423 --> 00:10:08,250
Speaker 1: The wings are causing all the trouble there.

159
00:10:09,572 --> 00:10:14,170
Speaker 0: Of course, he says enforcing this bill if it becomes law would be a challenge.

160
00:10:15,191 --> 00:10:18,886
Speaker 1: Well, okay, so he's not a hundred percent moron he's just 99.9 percent moron.

161
00:10:21,672 --> 00:10:22,254
Speaker 0: This is just like.

162
00:10:22,274 --> 00:10:23,098
Speaker 0: this is crazy.

163
00:10:23,178 --> 00:10:25,750
Speaker 0: quote if the bill becomes law the website operator.

164
00:10:26,213 --> 00:10:28,970
Speaker 0: So I guess this only affects website operators in Kentucky.

165
00:10:29,052 --> 00:10:34,190
Speaker 0: Okay Would have to pay if someone was allowed to post information anonymously on their site.

166
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:39,590
Speaker 0: The fine would be five hundred dollars for a first offense and one thousand dollars for each offense after that.

167
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,753
Speaker 1: So basically all that.

168
00:10:40,934 --> 00:10:41,455
Speaker 1: why doesn't he?

169
00:10:41,796 --> 00:10:46,810
Speaker 1: that's the same thing as writing a law saying we don't want anyone to host websites in Kentucky.

170
00:10:47,852 --> 00:10:48,575
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

171
00:10:48,616 --> 00:10:51,250
Speaker 0: but it's also illegal to post anything online.

172
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,887
Speaker 0: So if you live in Kentucky and you post on slash dot you're breaking the law.

173
00:10:55,927 --> 00:10:56,530
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

174
00:10:57,373 --> 00:11:01,070
Speaker 1: But if you're anonymous and you're in Kentucky, how the fuck will they know?

175
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,530
Speaker 0: Well, they'll probably try to subpoena slashed out for IP addresses.

176
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,358
Speaker 1: So wait, they're gonna subpoena slash time.

177
00:11:06,378 --> 00:11:11,690
Speaker 1: say give us the IP addresses of every anonymous poster And we're gonna look and see if any of them are in Kentucky.

178
00:11:12,612 --> 00:11:14,142
Speaker 1: Well, no, that's not gonna fly.

179
00:11:14,343 --> 00:11:15,330
Speaker 0: what they'd be tricky.

180
00:11:15,611 --> 00:11:25,627
Speaker 0: What they probably do is just ban any sort of business interactions with slash dot Which is fine because I don't think there's any company in Kentucky that would bother advertising on slash dot.

181
00:11:26,109 --> 00:11:26,330
Speaker 1: man.

182
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:30,310
Speaker 1: I hope they do this because it'd be so cool to drive through Kentucky in the future.

183
00:11:30,651 --> 00:11:34,441
Speaker 1: It'd be like Jetson's house Jetson's house caveman log cabin.

184
00:11:34,481 --> 00:11:35,685
Speaker 1: caveman log cabin.

185
00:11:35,725 --> 00:11:36,326
Speaker 1: Jetson's house.

186
00:11:36,346 --> 00:11:37,670
Speaker 1: when you come back out on the other side.

187
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,980
Speaker 0: This is so ludicrous that it's not even worth discussing.

188
00:11:40,711 --> 00:11:45,369
Speaker 0: Banning anonymity on the internet is like banning spitting in a dark room.

189
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,976
Speaker 0: Okay, anyway, so what do you got?

190
00:11:49,397 --> 00:11:52,626
Speaker 1: so, you know, I hate the fake medicines a lot.

191
00:11:52,907 --> 00:11:53,790
Speaker 1: you hate the fake medicines.

192
00:11:54,332 --> 00:12:09,322
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only difference between the two of us is that Scott will not shop at the local Hippie market because while the local hippie market is the only store in the area that has a lot of really good stuff It also sells made-up fake dangerous medicine pretty much.

193
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:10,024
Speaker 1: Well, it's not.

194
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,348
Speaker 1: it's the opposite of dangerous.

195
00:12:11,468 --> 00:12:12,352
Speaker 1: It does nothing That's.

196
00:12:12,996 --> 00:12:14,606
Speaker 0: that's a problem from other perspectives.

197
00:12:14,686 --> 00:12:15,129
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is.

198
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:23,470
Speaker 0: But the only difference is that I will go there But I will get into arguments with people and generally be a cock while I'm there and I'll feel dirty the whole time.

199
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,990
Speaker 0: But it's the only place I can buy my guava juice.

200
00:12:26,271 --> 00:12:28,943
Speaker 1: You can buy guava juice across the river at the other place.

201
00:12:29,164 --> 00:12:30,530
Speaker 0: Yes across the river.

202
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:34,343
Speaker 1: Can you buy guava juice in the city and then carry it home?

203
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,046
Speaker 1: Yeah, why not?

204
00:12:35,126 --> 00:12:36,250
Speaker 1: I carry stuff to the city.

205
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,175
Speaker 1: I might as well carry it home.

206
00:12:37,275 --> 00:12:38,522
Speaker 0: That's not worth it.

207
00:12:38,663 --> 00:12:42,077
Speaker 0: Anyway, so You know how I get away with it.

208
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:46,292
Speaker 0: I buy small amounts with my credit card Something I hate.

209
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:46,633
Speaker 1: worse.

210
00:12:46,995 --> 00:12:47,576
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't know.

211
00:12:47,596 --> 00:12:55,685
Speaker 1: hate equally to fake medicine is when people are putting down real medicine Like those people who say don't take vaccines, they'll give you autism.

212
00:12:55,806 --> 00:12:56,710
Speaker 1: All right complete bullshit.

213
00:12:57,012 --> 00:12:59,084
Speaker 0: I think we can sum this up real quick in case anyone.

214
00:12:59,124 --> 00:13:06,762
Speaker 0: we have a lot of new listeners So in case you're not up to speed One the Marisol isn't even used in fucking vaccines anymore in the u.s.

215
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:09,790
Speaker 0: So it doesn't even matter - it doesn't cause autism.

216
00:13:10,551 --> 00:13:14,119
Speaker 0: three Vaccines in general do not cause autism period.

217
00:13:15,351 --> 00:13:21,555
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if you don't notice right, I mean I had a biology teacher once in 11th grade and he was like Oh, you don't need vaccines.

218
00:13:21,575 --> 00:13:22,238
Speaker 1: It'd be alright.

219
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:24,770
Speaker 0: Right and wow that guy shouldn't be a biology teacher.

220
00:13:24,931 --> 00:13:33,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, and at the time it kind of made a little bit of sense, you know Cuz from what I learned in biology class, you know, like, you know, if a virus comes in your body will make antibodies.

221
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:34,575
Speaker 1: You know, whatever right?

222
00:13:34,957 --> 00:13:46,610
Speaker 1: He was like, oh you don't need to take a flu vaccine Just take some you know Nearly dead flu and just kind of swab them on the back of your throat and then your body will build up vaccine exactly What.

223
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:51,840
Speaker 1: So and it was only you know a couple years later that I realized huh?

224
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:52,362
Speaker 1: Okay.

225
00:13:52,723 --> 00:13:56,093
Speaker 1: Anyway, so yeah if you don't notice Right.

226
00:13:56,113 --> 00:14:05,910
Speaker 1: Oh and also the other argument that biology teacher used to make was you know Oh back in my day when the polio vaccine was coming out kids would get the vaccine and then they would still get polio.

227
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:13,589
Speaker 0: but So anyway, I have a hyphenated word to respond to that that is herd immunity, right.

228
00:14:13,669 --> 00:14:26,995
Speaker 1: so If you don't realize right, um way back before the polio vaccine There was a lot of polio and now after the polio vaccine Where's the polio?

229
00:14:27,015 --> 00:14:27,577
Speaker 1: I don't know.

230
00:14:27,677 --> 00:14:31,910
Speaker 1: maybe we should look for it, you know before MMR kids used to get measles.

231
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:32,452
Speaker 1: You know what.

232
00:14:32,512 --> 00:14:33,756
Speaker 1: and mumps and rubella.

233
00:14:33,776 --> 00:14:37,810
Speaker 0: I'll tell you this measles sucks mumps sucks rubella not cool.

234
00:14:38,151 --> 00:14:38,813
Speaker 1: But you know what?

235
00:14:38,873 --> 00:14:39,235
Speaker 1: now?

236
00:14:39,756 --> 00:14:40,719
Speaker 1: who gets measles?

237
00:14:41,161 --> 00:14:41,943
Speaker 1: who gets mumps?

238
00:14:42,244 --> 00:14:42,927
Speaker 1: who gets rubella?

239
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:47,822
Speaker 1: at least the United States Almost nobody, you know what you would get it like.

240
00:14:47,842 --> 00:14:50,030
Speaker 1: you would get the flu or the cold all the fucking time.

241
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,715
Speaker 1: But now no, it's gone.

242
00:14:52,036 --> 00:14:52,739
Speaker 0: tetanus shots.

243
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:53,802
Speaker 0: What about diptheria?

244
00:14:53,822 --> 00:14:56,330
Speaker 0: diptheria is actually really dangerous to a lot of kids.

245
00:14:56,631 --> 00:14:59,667
Speaker 0: But now you don't get to theory because you get your tetanus diptheria shot.

246
00:14:59,768 --> 00:15:00,772
Speaker 1: That's right But you know what?

247
00:15:00,913 --> 00:15:05,830
Speaker 1: now for anyone who doesn't believe in fucking vaccines and their awesomeness, right?

248
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,534
Speaker 0: I'm sure we don't need.

249
00:15:06,554 --> 00:15:08,305
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess we're preaching to the choir now.

250
00:15:08,788 --> 00:15:13,123
Speaker 1: Yes Because anyone who disagrees right stop listening cuz they're more.

251
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,790
Speaker 0: I don't want those people listening to my show.

252
00:15:15,151 --> 00:15:19,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you don't believe something like that that's in the past that you know, maybe it was something else.

253
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:20,941
Speaker 1: You don't know cuz you're a moron.

254
00:15:21,324 --> 00:15:23,519
Speaker 1: Here's an Inarguable proof.

255
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,008
Speaker 1: the vaccines are the real deal.

256
00:15:27,212 --> 00:15:31,447
Speaker 1: Uganda right people were kids were getting meningitis left and right.

257
00:15:31,989 --> 00:15:36,063
Speaker 1: like 5,000 kids a year would die from this horrible meningitis.

258
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:39,790
Speaker 1: and if you don't know about meningitis Meningitis is like the worst thing ever.

259
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:44,050
Speaker 0: There are two forms of meningitis effectively in terms of how they like what they can do to you.

260
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,138
Speaker 0: There's viral meningitis.

261
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,790
Speaker 1: I really quick and die even quicker.

262
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:52,547
Speaker 0: Well, actually the viral meningitis and bacterial meningitis and actually my stepdad had viral meningitis.

263
00:15:52,867 --> 00:15:56,830
Speaker 0: Uh, it's not At that bad, it's pretty bad.

264
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,499
Speaker 0: Most forms of bacterial cuz remember it's an infection of the meninges.

265
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:04,736
Speaker 0: if you don't know what meninges are I suggest get the learn To John Wikipedia.

266
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:07,866
Speaker 0: if you if there's bacteria growing in your meninges.

267
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:10,400
Speaker 1: you're serious shit You're going to die.

268
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,690
Speaker 1: You need those meninges.

269
00:16:12,754 --> 00:16:20,830
Speaker 1: but anyway, I Think the things that are in anyway or anyway, so there was mad mad meningitis going down in Uganda, right?

270
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,857
Speaker 1: So they got this vaccine.

271
00:16:22,877 --> 00:16:24,424
Speaker 1: this vaccine has existed since 1991, right?

272
00:16:26,272 --> 00:16:29,188
Speaker 1: But it cost seven dollars at the price.

273
00:16:29,228 --> 00:16:35,106
Speaker 1: to you know The poor country price was seven dollars which is seven times as much as some other vaccines that they could get.

274
00:16:35,246 --> 00:16:39,682
Speaker 1: so they You know through their magic works the kind of works that Bill Clinton are doing.

275
00:16:39,702 --> 00:16:40,846
Speaker 1: people like Bill Clinton are doing.

276
00:16:41,228 --> 00:16:49,098
Speaker 1: they got the price down to one dollar and they helped prevent 2.3 million deaths since the year 2000.

277
00:16:49,098 --> 00:16:53,390
Speaker 0: That's uh, that's closing in on Norman Norman Borlaug right there.

278
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,836
Speaker 1: I know what Uganda.

279
00:16:54,996 --> 00:16:57,765
Speaker 1: people dying of meningitis insert vaccine.

280
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:01,819
Speaker 1: No more Meningitis, huh?

281
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:03,626
Speaker 1: No, does it maybe work?

282
00:17:03,947 --> 00:17:04,670
Speaker 0: now to the crazy?

283
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:06,493
Speaker 0: Who argue that?

284
00:17:06,554 --> 00:17:10,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, it protects you from those diseases, but it also causes autism.

285
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:16,506
Speaker 0: I would wager that autism rates in Uganda are not gonna change.

286
00:17:16,686 --> 00:17:16,887
Speaker 1: No.

287
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:30,689
Speaker 0: No, I don't think so except perhaps that maybe a percentage of children who might have died of meningitis before they had the chance to even Manifest their autism will now manifest their autism, but that's not.

288
00:17:31,512 --> 00:17:32,815
Speaker 1: Anyway, so here's the thing, right?

289
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:34,620
Speaker 1: I'm sure that in Uganda.

290
00:17:34,641 --> 00:17:38,895
Speaker 1: They had plenty of witch doctoring maybe homeopathies maybe Acupuncture's.

291
00:17:38,915 --> 00:17:40,987
Speaker 1: who knows they probably had some bullshit medicine.

292
00:17:41,007 --> 00:17:41,469
Speaker 1: You know what?

293
00:17:42,411 --> 00:17:43,034
Speaker 1: They had that.

294
00:17:43,074 --> 00:17:45,688
Speaker 1: they've had that because that's the argument people always make right.

295
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:48,802
Speaker 1: this Acupuncture has been around for millions of years.

296
00:17:48,863 --> 00:17:49,264
Speaker 1: Therefore.

297
00:17:49,285 --> 00:17:50,470
Speaker 1: It's so old and ancient.

298
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:54,270
Speaker 1: It must be right because anything old is right something new is wrong.

299
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:59,781
Speaker 0: speaking of which acupuncture reflex ology and Chiropractic are bullshit and homeopathy.

300
00:17:59,921 --> 00:18:01,469
Speaker 0: Yes, but I'm assuming you know that.

301
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:01,670
Speaker 0: yeah.

302
00:18:02,352 --> 00:18:12,490
Speaker 1: Anyway in Uganda, they've had some sort of fake medicine probably for a very long time And you know what the meningitis didn't stop until the real medicine came.

303
00:18:14,332 --> 00:18:18,026
Speaker 1: Real medicine is real fake medicine is fake.

304
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:18,930
Speaker 1: shut the fuck.

305
00:18:20,536 --> 00:18:26,270
Speaker 0: The Problem is I don't think anyone who needs to hear that message is listening to geek nights let alone on the internet.

306
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:27,815
Speaker 1: No, I don't think so.

307
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:31,568
Speaker 1: But even if one person has learned it'll be enough.

308
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:35,606
Speaker 0: so Right along with that since my news was such a cop-out.

309
00:18:35,646 --> 00:18:38,869
Speaker 0: I just I couldn't Ignore this to get to the Facebook news or what?

310
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,956
Speaker 0: I got a news here that it's kind of interesting.

311
00:18:41,016 --> 00:18:44,447
Speaker 0: actually now the article to which this links includes a video.

312
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:47,204
Speaker 0: do not Okay, watch this video.

313
00:18:47,244 --> 00:18:49,653
Speaker 0: the video is absolutely Stupid.

314
00:18:49,854 --> 00:18:50,698
Speaker 1: I didn't watch the video.

315
00:18:50,718 --> 00:18:52,770
Speaker 1: I just read the article which is disappointingly short.

316
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:55,884
Speaker 0: Yes, the articles dumb the videos dumb, but it's one of those.

317
00:18:55,904 --> 00:18:57,310
Speaker 0: the article doesn't matter.

318
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,579
Speaker 0: What matters is the discussion that is generated?

319
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,989
Speaker 1: I think you'll make a good Thursday episode and we should hang on to it.

320
00:19:02,471 --> 00:19:03,879
Speaker 0: Oh, maybe we will but I'll introduce it.

321
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,066
Speaker 0: then I'll do two half news's.

322
00:19:05,106 --> 00:19:05,750
Speaker 0: I think that works.

323
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:11,210
Speaker 0: So the question raised is should scientists date people who believe in astrology?

324
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:13,805
Speaker 1: The short answer right?

325
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,650
Speaker 1: No Here's my short answer, right?

326
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,781
Speaker 1: Every individual human being can date whoever the fuck they want.

327
00:19:21,162 --> 00:19:22,627
Speaker 1: And here's my other answer.

328
00:19:22,647 --> 00:19:23,610
Speaker 1: I wouldn't.

329
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:32,001
Speaker 0: Well, you see it's actually I don't know how complicated of an issue it is because the way I look at it I mean you I mean there's arguments for I'll read the rest of this here.

330
00:19:32,423 --> 00:19:36,850
Speaker 0: wired science asks should Scientists date people who believe in astrology?

331
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,508
Speaker 0: Apparently the argument is quite complex.

332
00:19:40,211 --> 00:19:44,282
Speaker 0: Astrology is a complex flawed mental shortcut for understanding the world.

333
00:19:44,523 --> 00:19:45,345
Speaker 0: That's an understatement.

334
00:19:45,566 --> 00:19:46,428
Speaker 1: It's quite an understatement.

335
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:50,280
Speaker 0: So is Disregarding someone because of their spiritual beliefs.

336
00:19:50,561 --> 00:19:51,864
Speaker 0: That's that does not follow.

337
00:19:51,905 --> 00:19:55,457
Speaker 0: That's not quite a anyway false premise.

338
00:19:55,477 --> 00:20:09,170
Speaker 0: possibly anyway, women are inundated with astrological nonsense from fashion magazines So so it is normative for them to believe it even if they otherwise are highly logical.

339
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:09,793
Speaker 0: That's excellent.

340
00:20:10,034 --> 00:20:13,030
Speaker 0: that that's that takes sexism to a new level that I don't know.

341
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,350
Speaker 1: I think that's about on the same level.

342
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,353
Speaker 1: I've seen it everywhere else.

343
00:20:15,413 --> 00:20:18,842
Speaker 0: and the last thing smart people can convince themselves of silly things.

344
00:20:18,882 --> 00:20:49,790
Speaker 0: now, there is an interesting phenomenon whereby Certain sometimes people who are very smart will defend a wrong idea long after they would have in a vacuum already been convinced that the idea was wrong because of misplaced pride and because a lot of times smart people are able to find evidence and Put forth their arguments eloquently in order to kind of hold out longer like you might be wrong But you might be smart enough to convince people who are dumber than you that you're right anyway longer until someone smart such a right.

345
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:56,173
Speaker 1: There's also the problem of this is where we're gonna start doing the whole episode on it and that there are people who are very Intelligent.

346
00:20:56,193 --> 00:21:22,894
Speaker 1: they're very knowledgeable about the world and they're very good at you know Math and or other things right or writing or whatever and they're very intelligent smart people, but they don't have the the skeptical Scientific evidence is required or I will believe nothing viewpoint of the world Which is the only correct sort of viewpoint to have to be completely rational and thus they can convince themselves Of irrational things.

347
00:21:23,496 --> 00:21:27,689
Speaker 0: now, I mean that I take issue with almost every sentence in this little summary here.

348
00:21:27,729 --> 00:21:32,379
Speaker 0: I mean Astrology is a flawed mental shortcut for understanding the world.

349
00:21:32,439 --> 00:21:36,050
Speaker 0: astrology saying it's a flawed mental shortcut goes a step.

350
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:38,818
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just outright sham.

351
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:39,500
Speaker 0: It's nothing.

352
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,423
Speaker 0: It was anything.

353
00:21:40,483 --> 00:21:42,569
Speaker 0: It's just astrology is fantasy.

354
00:21:42,609 --> 00:21:42,849
Speaker 1: That's it.

355
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,658
Speaker 1: It's that's just all there is to it.

356
00:21:44,699 --> 00:21:45,905
Speaker 1: It's completely made up nothing.

357
00:21:46,066 --> 00:21:46,910
Speaker 0: and the whole women thing.

358
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,588
Speaker 0: I don't even want to touch that because that's just.

359
00:21:49,412 --> 00:21:54,027
Speaker 1: Yeah, I hope I clicked on the link because the link was just like should scientists date an astrologer?

360
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:55,680
Speaker 1: and I was like Oh, that's not a bad.

361
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:56,530
Speaker 1: I you know article.

362
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,868
Speaker 1: I'll read that but the article is so bad and disappointing.

363
00:21:59,908 --> 00:22:04,229
Speaker 0: in short I was like, ah, but the whole but so is disregarding someone because of their spiritual beliefs.

364
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:17,550
Speaker 0: now there's a real issue here with conflating ideas and spirituality and philosophy and religion are three very different things and people

365
00:22:17,811 --> 00:22:25,729
Speaker 1: You know have different definitions of them and such and you sort of have to before you discuss them with someone Decide what the definitions are going to do something.

366
00:22:26,172 --> 00:22:32,887
Speaker 0: There are a lot of people who are very spiritual but at the same time do not hold any irrational beliefs at all.

367
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:46,289
Speaker 0: and there are a lot of people who when confronted with an atheist or someone who believes in science will Make an argument along the lines of oh you say there's no and nothing out there There can't be anything out there.

368
00:22:46,611 --> 00:22:51,529
Speaker 0: But this on earth for what we've seen that nothing could possibly exist because that it added up.

369
00:22:52,031 --> 00:22:54,217
Speaker 0: But that's just because they're conflating the terms.

370
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,770
Speaker 0: just because I haven't observed something doesn't mean it's not out there or something like that.

371
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:05,399
Speaker 0: It just means I haven't observed it there and no one I've ever met or ever read of or ever Experienced has ever observed it.

372
00:23:05,439 --> 00:23:06,587
Speaker 0: There's no record of observing it.

373
00:23:07,331 --> 00:23:13,630
Speaker 0: Logically, I cannot believe that it exists and I can logically assume that it probably does not exist.

374
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:16,830
Speaker 0: But that does not discount outright that it does not exist.

375
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:21,090
Speaker 0: But a rational person will assume that it does not exist unless presented with other evidence.

376
00:23:21,271 --> 00:23:23,144
Speaker 1: Yes, this is why we should do a whole episode on this.

377
00:23:23,184 --> 00:23:29,305
Speaker 0: I think we should you know Yeah, just kind of the idea that denouncing religion in and of itself is not denouncing philosophy.

378
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,990
Speaker 0: I think it is spirituality.

379
00:23:31,593 --> 00:23:42,580
Speaker 1: I think basically it goes back to our old point of you know While discriminating against anyone seems wrong and in many cases is wrong But it depends on why you discriminate against the person.

380
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,789
Speaker 1: if I discriminate against someone because they're a psycho killer That's okay.

381
00:23:47,252 --> 00:23:51,890
Speaker 1: If I discriminated against someone because they believe the tooth fairy is real that's okay.

382
00:23:52,091 --> 00:23:56,264
Speaker 0: If I discriminate against someone because they're black whoa now that trouble.

383
00:23:56,525 --> 00:24:00,701
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's not okay You know, but I mean it's kind of like.

384
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:08,629
Speaker 1: I mean if I discriminate against someone Who's a Jew because they were born of Jewish parents and they have a Jewish culture That's not okay.

385
00:24:08,972 --> 00:24:16,262
Speaker 1: If I discriminated against someone because they believe in a magical Skyman and they treat their wife poorly that is okay.

386
00:24:16,543 --> 00:24:21,210
Speaker 1: those, you know, the thing is they both, you know You could put you on both of those things, but they're two different.

387
00:24:22,031 --> 00:24:23,698
Speaker 1: This is where you run into trouble.

388
00:24:23,758 --> 00:24:26,670
Speaker 0: you say we need a word for secular Jew as opposed to religious.

389
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:34,642
Speaker 1: We need we need a word in general for secular kinds of thing, you know Yeah, like a Muslim religious Muslim cultural Muslim big difference.

390
00:24:34,903 --> 00:24:41,646
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, yeah, there are people who are just Irish You know, they just love Ireland and they like to drink and they like leprechauns.

391
00:24:41,707 --> 00:24:49,594
Speaker 1: Wow way to go Yeah, I know right and I'm throwing to my little funniness there, but they're not like super Catholics like You know could be off.

392
00:24:49,774 --> 00:24:53,930
Speaker 1: most Irish type peoples are because it's also the Protestant Irish and that is why they have wars and things.

393
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,642
Speaker 1: But not getting into that because I don't know enough about it.

394
00:24:56,682 --> 00:24:58,610
Speaker 0: to say more I could speak volumes.

395
00:24:58,853 --> 00:25:01,996
Speaker 1: I just get into trouble for For many reasons.

396
00:25:02,056 --> 00:25:05,267
Speaker 0: It was actually a hot issue in Detroit and I'm well versed in the.

397
00:25:05,427 --> 00:25:07,777
Speaker 1: the Irish trouble I'm only slightly versed.

398
00:25:07,917 --> 00:25:10,610
Speaker 1: So let us pass that on and continue to things of the day.

399
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:13,124
Speaker 0: Well, I'll end on this because this is this is the important thing.

400
00:25:13,164 --> 00:25:14,130
Speaker 0: I want to get out of this here.

401
00:25:15,691 --> 00:25:26,405
Speaker 0: When it comes to disregard it people seem to try to make spiritual or religious beliefs somehow different from other kinds of beliefs or other kinds of assertions and I can't go there.

402
00:25:26,606 --> 00:25:59,910
Speaker 0: I'm of the mind that Any idea once an idea is put forth into the world into the marketplace of ideas If someone states an idea that idea is now no matter who said it no matter what backing it has subject to the scrutiny of the world and subject to all the verbal or written criticism that any human being can muster and If someone is not willing to deal with that sort of criticism or that sort of critique Then they really shouldn't be putting forth the idea and then getting in a huff when people Possibly disrespect or shoot down or otherwise criticize the idea.

403
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,917
Speaker 1: Yep, all ideas are created equal.

404
00:26:02,078 --> 00:26:05,370
Speaker 1: if your idea can't stand up on its own then it can't stand up.

405
00:26:06,052 --> 00:26:07,117
Speaker 1: Idea is sacred.

406
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:09,486
Speaker 0: but to get to the I'm done now, this is it.

407
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:10,470
Speaker 0: This is the easy way.

408
00:26:10,932 --> 00:26:12,499
Speaker 0: It's real easy to get into the whole.

409
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,207
Speaker 0: Well, what about philosophical?

410
00:26:14,247 --> 00:26:14,890
Speaker 0: What about blah?

411
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:20,025
Speaker 0: It's very very very simple to answer this question.

412
00:26:20,085 --> 00:26:27,910
Speaker 0: if you get into these specific Questions instead of the general questions would I ever date or even associate with someone who actually believed in astrology?

413
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:31,880
Speaker 0: No, hell no, I wouldn't even respect you exactly.

414
00:26:32,061 --> 00:26:33,806
Speaker 0: astrology is BS if you believe in it.

415
00:26:34,188 --> 00:26:34,769
Speaker 0: I hate you.

416
00:26:36,873 --> 00:26:46,472
Speaker 1: We're gonna get nasty lettuce and astrology listeners anyway.

417
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:49,455
Speaker 0: things of the day This.

418
00:26:49,937 --> 00:26:51,906
Speaker 0: I'd really like to talk about this as a whole show.

419
00:26:51,966 --> 00:26:54,736
Speaker 1: It's almost I love The whole shows isn't it?

420
00:26:54,997 --> 00:27:02,122
Speaker 0: But I'll just briefly in case anyone missed this on slashdot I want to direct your attention to the Cuban memory stick underground.

421
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:03,988
Speaker 0: very simply the idea here.

422
00:27:04,028 --> 00:27:06,641
Speaker 0: Is that Cuba kind of repressed?

423
00:27:07,023 --> 00:27:25,430
Speaker 0: difficult to get information Censorship abroad, you know, a lot of people try to make Cuba out to be this socialist paradise and Regardless of the reasons for Cuba being the way it is because they're largely the United States fault It remains that Cuba is not a very nice place to live and Cuba has serious problems.

424
00:27:25,891 --> 00:27:29,503
Speaker 1: Then the only the nicest thing about Cuba is the weather pretty much.

425
00:27:30,084 --> 00:27:34,507
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the health system is okay But don't pretend it's this wonderful like.

426
00:27:34,628 --> 00:27:39,510
Speaker 1: anyway He was actually a lot nicer for tourists than it is for people living there.

427
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:42,832
Speaker 1: And the problem is tourists come there and it's kind of nice But they don't realize.

428
00:27:42,852 --> 00:27:53,970
Speaker 0: a lot of the things tourists get are like, you know, not allowed for normal citizens Yep, but anyway, so the Cuban memory stick underground refers to the fact that there is now a trade.

429
00:27:54,331 --> 00:27:55,114
Speaker 0: This is like sneaker.

430
00:27:55,134 --> 00:28:02,900
Speaker 0: net times a million in USB sticks filled with websites Information and pretty much anything they can get from the outside world.

431
00:28:03,201 --> 00:28:04,846
Speaker 0: people smuggle them in and ship them in.

432
00:28:05,127 --> 00:28:10,642
Speaker 0: they copy them and pass them around and This is utterly utterly fascinating to me.

433
00:28:10,682 --> 00:28:11,646
Speaker 0: That's so awesome.

434
00:28:11,686 --> 00:28:18,548
Speaker 1: They can't get the internet So someone copies a bunch of websites on to like flash memories takes and then they share them all.

435
00:28:18,588 --> 00:28:19,190
Speaker 1: that's so cool.

436
00:28:19,451 --> 00:28:20,294
Speaker 0: It gives me an idea.

437
00:28:20,334 --> 00:28:21,438
Speaker 1: what computers are they using?

438
00:28:21,478 --> 00:28:23,365
Speaker 1: because no one's sending them computers, right?

439
00:28:23,446 --> 00:28:24,610
Speaker 0: You can get a hold of computers.

440
00:28:25,175 --> 00:28:26,588
Speaker 1: Yeah, they got like computers with USB.

441
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,318
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah, how long is it?

442
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:29,645
Speaker 1: but the embargoes been going on?

443
00:28:29,686 --> 00:28:30,510
Speaker 1: how long how you know?

444
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:31,857
Speaker 1: What kind of things get smuggled in?

445
00:28:31,898 --> 00:28:33,990
Speaker 0: and there are nations that are not embargo in Cuba?

446
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:35,003
Speaker 1: No, I guess.

447
00:28:35,084 --> 00:28:40,070
Speaker 0: but yeah The thing is it's easier to get crappy old computers than it is to get internet access.

448
00:28:40,171 --> 00:28:41,550
Speaker 0: I want to is to get around the sensor.

449
00:28:41,731 --> 00:28:43,661
Speaker 1: I want to know what the gaming scene is.

450
00:28:43,802 --> 00:28:45,270
Speaker 1: the video gaming scene is liking cute.

451
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,741
Speaker 0: I'll bet there's a lot of old.

452
00:28:46,782 --> 00:28:47,830
Speaker 0: Sega Genesis is down.

453
00:28:48,011 --> 00:28:54,858
Speaker 1: I bet there's something going on there and I want in on that action because it's probably people who are like Rockin a Street Fighter 2 machine somewhere in Cuba.

454
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:55,922
Speaker 0: It's gives me an idea.

455
00:28:55,982 --> 00:29:08,657
Speaker 0: I'd kind of like to set up some sort of charitable gray market charity organization where we basically put information on memory sticks and Airdrop them in places like Afghanistan and China.

456
00:29:09,118 --> 00:29:10,321
Speaker 1: Oh, we do better with hard drives.

457
00:29:10,361 --> 00:29:21,934
Speaker 1: I think make no yes hard drives coming from the sky A little tight, you know those little parachutes at the army man, you'd buy them in like the 25 cent, you know machine They come a little bubble.

458
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:25,470
Speaker 1: Yes, we could just tie the USB stick to that with a little parachute.

459
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,020
Speaker 0: I used to put those on model rockets.

460
00:29:27,081 --> 00:29:28,349
Speaker 0: I never saw those army men again.

461
00:29:28,913 --> 00:29:33,881
Speaker 1: I used to just throw them off like out of my window or whatever and anyway I think they would be stuck in a bush and I'd get them out.

462
00:29:33,901 --> 00:29:35,188
Speaker 1: and they don't be one-time use.

463
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:36,896
Speaker 0: now You got to wrap that thing.

464
00:29:36,976 --> 00:29:38,242
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah, it's a pain.

465
00:29:38,282 --> 00:29:38,744
Speaker 0: What do you got?

466
00:29:38,765 --> 00:29:40,975
Speaker 1: Oh Right things a day.

467
00:29:41,377 --> 00:29:43,587
Speaker 1: So when I was a kid, I played Legos.

468
00:29:43,627 --> 00:29:44,190
Speaker 1: you play Legos.

469
00:29:45,411 --> 00:29:46,810
Speaker 0: Legos were like the best thing ever.

470
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:52,130
Speaker 0: In fact, the only reason I'm still doing gig nights is because my mom has never shipped me all my Legos.

471
00:29:52,431 --> 00:30:01,684
Speaker 1: Anyway, so when I was a kid, I thought I was so cool in the days before the internet You know I wrote a letter to Lego because I was mostly playing with my castle Legos.

472
00:30:01,744 --> 00:30:04,014
Speaker 1: cuz I like the castles which is still the best Legos, right?

473
00:30:04,155 --> 00:30:06,509
Speaker 1: I had my Robin Hood's and I had the black Knights and they go haha.

474
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:13,690
Speaker 1: Anyway, I went I was playing my Legos and I said, you know, what would be cool if they had like race car Legos?

475
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:15,169
Speaker 1: And of course they didn't have race car Legos.

476
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:24,526
Speaker 1: But I was stupid and I was a little punk kid like elementary school and I said, you know, let's be cool They'd army man Legos, which they did not have and they still do not have army man Legos.

477
00:30:24,787 --> 00:30:25,630
Speaker 0: that kind of makes sense.

478
00:30:26,071 --> 00:30:31,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, because they don't like the violence and such right unless the violence is directed at pirates or spacemen.

479
00:30:31,954 --> 00:30:32,142
Speaker 0: Yeah.

480
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:37,690
Speaker 1: So I wrote a letter to Lego and I was like you should make race car Legos and army man Legos.

481
00:30:38,112 --> 00:30:42,841
Speaker 1: And they just sent me back and they were like, thanks for your ideas But we can't use your ideas blah.

482
00:30:42,982 --> 00:30:43,646
Speaker 1: and that was like.

483
00:30:43,707 --> 00:30:49,626
Speaker 1: as a punk kid I was like, yeah, fuck you and There still are no army man Legos and there always were race car Legos.

484
00:30:49,666 --> 00:30:51,458
Speaker 1: like one of the first Lego I was dumb plus.

485
00:30:51,498 --> 00:30:58,949
Speaker 0: I mean no violence in Legos I'm sure all of you out there whenever you needed to deal with dissidents you made the gallows out of that whip.

486
00:30:59,411 --> 00:31:00,434
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know right.

487
00:31:00,976 --> 00:31:02,702
Speaker 1: Anyway, this is a website.

488
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:08,218
Speaker 1: brick arms calm and you know what they sell Illegal arms for Lego man.

489
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:12,750
Speaker 1: pretty much it is like the black market of Lego pieces.

490
00:31:12,851 --> 00:31:14,489
Speaker 1: They got like you can make terrorists.

491
00:31:14,871 --> 00:31:18,421
Speaker 1: They got like every all different kinds of guns like.

492
00:31:18,882 --> 00:31:20,246
Speaker 1: they got mp5s.

493
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:21,569
Speaker 1: They got TMPs.

494
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,636
Speaker 1: They got p90s.

495
00:31:23,656 --> 00:31:24,660
Speaker 1: They got FAMAS.

496
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,847
Speaker 1: They got you know sniper rifles.

497
00:31:26,867 --> 00:31:27,590
Speaker 1: They got grenades.

498
00:31:27,931 --> 00:31:32,050
Speaker 1: They got like bunches of grenades that you can like bunch up on the front of a Lego guy.

499
00:31:32,492 --> 00:31:35,905
Speaker 1: They got like scary German Nazi soldiers with dogs.

500
00:31:35,945 --> 00:31:37,030
Speaker 0: Do they have bandoliers?

501
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:40,030
Speaker 1: I don't know if they have bit those guys with band.

502
00:31:40,171 --> 00:31:40,614
Speaker 1: Yeah, they have.

503
00:31:40,634 --> 00:31:42,990
Speaker 1: the guys have bandoliers like painted on their body.

504
00:31:43,452 --> 00:31:47,469
Speaker 0: I want like a bandolier much like that arrow sheet that I can put on a Lego man.

505
00:31:48,211 --> 00:31:53,990
Speaker 1: But if you're looking for like some military Lego action brick arms calm as like the full loadout.

506
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:57,124
Speaker 1: Let me let me read some of these to you brick arms bandit.

507
00:31:57,405 --> 00:31:59,954
Speaker 1: He looks like a terrorist Colonel marine.

508
00:32:00,315 --> 00:32:03,022
Speaker 1: Oh, it's some girl who's like a marine spy bio.

509
00:32:03,082 --> 00:32:03,744
Speaker 1: James Bond.

510
00:32:04,225 --> 00:32:04,887
Speaker 1: World War two.

511
00:32:04,947 --> 00:32:05,689
Speaker 1: German SS.

512
00:32:05,749 --> 00:32:07,234
Speaker 1: major World War two.

513
00:32:07,275 --> 00:32:08,158
Speaker 1: German colonel.

514
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,403
Speaker 1: World War two.

515
00:32:09,463 --> 00:32:11,150
Speaker 1: German soldier panzer green.

516
00:32:11,674 --> 00:32:18,708
Speaker 1: There's a lot of Legos going on here and if you like the militaries This is a. this is where your Legos are at and you could buy it up.

517
00:32:19,653 --> 00:32:22,570
Speaker 1: And I think they have a deal like where every time you buy something you get a free gun.

518
00:32:23,855 --> 00:32:38,695
Speaker 1: It would hurt RPGs not bad Do they shoot know that of course just plastic RPGs that a Lego guy can hold in his hand and they come in dark blue gray medium gray silver metallic and I see some gold in there but Metallic not bad.

519
00:32:38,776 --> 00:32:41,948
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there's also I think that might be some miss painted ones that look gold.

520
00:32:42,129 --> 00:32:42,470
Speaker 1: Who knows?

521
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:50,150
Speaker 0: So anyway, this won't be super long because a lot of the topics I have to bring up in this series are very very detailed.

522
00:32:50,613 --> 00:32:53,510
Speaker 0: For Scott to relax I kind of just want to give a basic overview.

523
00:32:53,590 --> 00:33:09,784
Speaker 0: But as we said last week Scott and I are going to for a while now alternate between talking about our respective majors computer science and information technology and Scott spent much of last week Describing well last Monday at least talking about what computer science and programming and all those things really were.

524
00:33:09,864 --> 00:33:16,290
Speaker 0: so to dispel the myths The legends and everything that you thought you knew about information technology.

525
00:33:16,874 --> 00:33:23,269
Speaker 0: Here we go because you see IT is Actually a super new degree a super new program.

526
00:33:23,912 --> 00:33:27,905
Speaker 0: IT did not exist as it does today in this world until very recently.

527
00:33:27,945 --> 00:33:41,489
Speaker 0: in fact the first Information technology program at a real university with a bachelor's that was accredited was formed in 1991 by of all places the Rochester Institute of Technology my alma mater.

528
00:33:42,757 --> 00:33:50,930
Speaker 0: It turns out you know I think I've mentioned this before that I actually studied IT at the first and foremost IT school in the world.

529
00:33:51,652 --> 00:33:54,441
Speaker 1: I studied CS at the first and foremost IT school in the world.

530
00:33:54,641 --> 00:34:04,869
Speaker 0: ha but actually up there that for computer science RIT was in the first I think five Universities to have a computer science bachelor's something like that back in the 70s something like that.

531
00:34:05,191 --> 00:34:09,690
Speaker 0: So yeah, RIT is I mean, it's not super known outside of its circles.

532
00:34:09,791 --> 00:34:16,183
Speaker 0: But if you're a young punk kid and you're thinking about information technology And you got a lot of money you pretty much or you can get a scholarship.

533
00:34:16,223 --> 00:34:18,958
Speaker 0: if you're a national marriage scholar you realize They'll give you a full ride.

534
00:34:19,342 --> 00:34:19,503
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

535
00:34:19,603 --> 00:34:23,056
Speaker 0: But anyway RIT is the IT school.

536
00:34:23,255 --> 00:34:26,103
Speaker 0: IT began there and IT is on the bleeding edge there.

537
00:34:26,626 --> 00:34:29,754
Speaker 0: So what is Information technology?

538
00:34:29,815 --> 00:34:37,650
Speaker 0: because it's actually kind of complicated and since it's a new degree How we've had computers and we've had IT relatively new for a long time.

539
00:34:38,051 --> 00:34:39,918
Speaker 0: So how come there were no what?

540
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:42,125
Speaker 0: where were people getting these jobs?

541
00:34:42,186 --> 00:34:43,429
Speaker 0: How are people doing these jobs?

542
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:46,109
Speaker 1: If there were no idea learning on the job, they were learning at home.

543
00:34:46,362 --> 00:35:03,490
Speaker 0: well the answer is that the majority of computer workers pretty much from the beginning of computing until Now and even now it's really hasn't changed much yet We're untrained people who learned as they went had no actual formal training in computers or IT or anything like that.

544
00:35:04,272 --> 00:35:10,730
Speaker 0: And that is the cause behind the majority of the kind of clusterfucks of computing that exists today.

545
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:17,350
Speaker 0: You see when computers were they first existed there wasn't that much to know about computers.

546
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:22,124
Speaker 0: so computer science kind of encompassed everything that computers were.

547
00:35:22,906 --> 00:35:25,650
Speaker 0: and then as time went on Computers got too complicated.

548
00:35:25,753 --> 00:35:39,149
Speaker 0: I mean Computers as a physical thing became so complex that you could devote your entire bachelor's or even master's study to just how computers worked physically how they were put together electronics and that is computer engineering.

549
00:35:39,169 --> 00:35:40,753
Speaker 0: and Then there were people.

550
00:35:40,793 --> 00:35:41,979
Speaker 0: and so that kind of split off.

551
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,109
Speaker 0: and then you had computer science, which is everything else.

552
00:35:44,672 --> 00:35:46,841
Speaker 0: but as time went on I'm gonna skip over a lot of this.

553
00:35:46,881 --> 00:35:58,477
Speaker 0: but bit by bit every sort of Major every sort of discipline everything that could be split off has been bit by bit being split off from computer science Computer science itself split off.

554
00:35:58,497 --> 00:36:09,630
Speaker 0: computer science is now effectively the art of programming But even that is split into computer science and software engineering and all these kind of specialties are brancing out from the core.

555
00:36:10,156 --> 00:36:14,869
Speaker 0: And it's come to the point that Information technology is the glue that connects everything together.

556
00:36:15,551 --> 00:36:22,429
Speaker 0: IT is in one hand the catch-all for anything and everything related to computers that does not have its own specialist discipline.

557
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:39,550
Speaker 0: and more importantly Information technology is the degree the program the idea the study the field of practice that Kind of has the overview that knows enough about every single discipline to be able to manage computer environments.

558
00:36:39,711 --> 00:36:53,590
Speaker 0: I mean say you've got a company and you want to write some software you want to do something cool All right, you got to hire some CS guys to actually write your software Maybe some software engineering guys to kind of manage the software projects, but what about your infrastructure?

559
00:36:53,971 --> 00:36:59,970
Speaker 0: You don't want the same people writing your code Managing your routers, I mean most people actually a lot of companies.

560
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:01,201
Speaker 1: That's exactly what happens.

561
00:37:01,282 --> 00:37:02,049
Speaker 0: and that is not.

562
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:05,941
Speaker 1: They can only hire one or two computer guys and they need both.

563
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,850
Speaker 1: so they get someone who has more than one skill set.

564
00:37:09,231 --> 00:37:14,347
Speaker 0: Yes, the problem is that usually does not work very well except in very very small environment.

565
00:37:14,367 --> 00:37:18,756
Speaker 1: Well, even if it works Well the person, you know that usually means that the person who is doing.

566
00:37:18,796 --> 00:37:25,320
Speaker 0: all that work is overworked and a lot of companies even have a lot of Misunderstandings as to what information technology is.

567
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,365
Speaker 0: a lot of big companies.

568
00:37:26,425 --> 00:37:27,470
Speaker 0: Look at it as almost a buzzword.

569
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:33,066
Speaker 0: Yep, we leverage our IT synergy to utilize our efficiency and that sort of bullshit.

570
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:43,549
Speaker 0: or even worse A lot of companies seem to think that you know, they have problems in their company and it's easy to say Oh those problems can be solved by technology, which is usually true.

571
00:37:44,312 --> 00:37:47,561
Speaker 0: Let's just get an IT department and everything will go away.

572
00:37:47,581 --> 00:37:49,807
Speaker 0: and that doesn't work at all.

573
00:37:50,148 --> 00:38:07,289
Speaker 0: because IT Basically all IT does in a company in any sort of real working environment is Make sure that all of the technology that is being used by a company or by an organization is used Effectively and as to the fullness that it can be used.

574
00:38:08,051 --> 00:38:11,816
Speaker 0: that is in a nutshell all that IT is all to IT exists.

575
00:38:11,836 --> 00:38:21,340
Speaker 0: to do is make sure that you're using the technology you have as Best you can and also to recommend new technology and then once that is implemented to use it effectively.

576
00:38:22,228 --> 00:38:24,986
Speaker 0: That seems really simple Doesn't doesn't that seem simple?

577
00:38:25,368 --> 00:38:31,910
Speaker 1: No, actually, I know it's not simple because Unless your company is one dude with one computer.

578
00:38:32,412 --> 00:38:34,900
Speaker 1: It's gonna be there's a lot of crazy stuff going on.

579
00:38:35,121 --> 00:38:37,057
Speaker 0: Well, see this is where the problem is.

580
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:45,060
Speaker 0: Most of the workforce in the world today in the information technology industry do not have information technology degrees.

581
00:38:45,622 --> 00:39:00,115
Speaker 0: people like me are the vast vast minority in the workforce and As a result, we have a lot of these sort of IT Organizations that aren't really doing what IT should be doing a lot of times.

582
00:39:00,356 --> 00:39:15,754
Speaker 0: They'll call it the IT department but then the IT department is full of people writing code and full of people writing the software that runs the business or full of people just doing all the sort of Computer geeky stuff that the CFO and the CEO don't really understand.

583
00:39:15,814 --> 00:39:18,681
Speaker 0: They lump it over into the IT department and Really?

584
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:25,720
Speaker 0: You've kind of got to have a an idea of what IT is and then you've got to actually organize your your stuff.

585
00:39:26,222 --> 00:39:28,070
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm trying to not get into the details here.

586
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:30,600
Speaker 0: That's why it might sound like I'm dancing around a lot of issues.

587
00:39:30,982 --> 00:39:34,639
Speaker 0: That's because I'm very purposely dancing around a lot of dance dance for me.

588
00:39:35,201 --> 00:39:40,680
Speaker 0: But you've got to understand that IT is not a revenue generating center.

589
00:39:41,061 --> 00:39:45,000
Speaker 0: Computer science in a company should be a revenue generating center.

590
00:39:45,241 --> 00:39:45,723
Speaker 1: It could be.

591
00:39:45,743 --> 00:39:45,783
Speaker 1: it

592
00:39:46,245 --> 00:39:46,646
Speaker 0: should be

593
00:39:47,008 --> 00:39:50,884
Speaker 1: unless you're selling the software if you're just using the software for yourself Maybe not

594
00:39:51,226 --> 00:40:01,907
Speaker 0: but even then if you're writing software for yourself Most likely you would have been better served by having an IT department that seeks out pre-existing solutions and then implements them for you

595
00:40:02,248 --> 00:40:04,734
Speaker 1: unless there is no pre-existing solution and

596
00:40:04,775 --> 00:40:13,040
Speaker 0: in which case then you would probably have an IT department that would hire people in a small CS development environment to write that software.

597
00:40:13,383 --> 00:40:15,500
Speaker 0: But technically the IT department would manage it.

598
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:29,360
Speaker 0: The IT department would put in the feature requests the bug fixes all that and the CS department should primarily be implementation May be headed up by a software engineer who manages all of that and provides the interface for the IT department.

599
00:40:29,842 --> 00:40:44,838
Speaker 0: but there's a lot of companies that end up having this sort of cross relationship where IT people talk directly to CS people who then go over the software engineer's head and all these interconnections kind of really make things difficult to manage.

600
00:40:44,858 --> 00:40:51,416
Speaker 0: and Thus I'm going to get into what IT is directly because here are all the things that IT is.

601
00:40:51,436 --> 00:40:53,943
Speaker 0: IT is Network monitoring.

602
00:40:54,505 --> 00:41:04,140
Speaker 0: IT is managing the development of the software that you use But not the software that makes your business go necessarily or that you were selling.

603
00:41:04,902 --> 00:41:10,960
Speaker 0: IT is security all security computer security software security network security.

604
00:41:11,682 --> 00:41:14,190
Speaker 0: IT is technology workflow management.

605
00:41:14,611 --> 00:41:19,767
Speaker 0: You know, I said you don't want all these connections people talking to people especially once you get into a larger organization.

606
00:41:20,148 --> 00:41:34,940
Speaker 0: what IT does is it sets up the workflows and Manages the workflows using technology so that like say you have people who write software for your company Right, and then you have people who use that software and then you have people who manage both sides of those people.

607
00:41:35,661 --> 00:41:57,660
Speaker 0: the IT person's job is to set up technology like wiki's or knowledge bases or ticketing systems or workflow systems or Like purchase asset management change tracking systems to kind of control all of these workflows and track all of these workflows So that everyone can get their job done and people aren't forced to do work that could be done better by someone else.

608
00:41:58,302 --> 00:42:05,193
Speaker 0: Like I'm a CS guy and I'm writing my code I shouldn't need to prioritize Which bug fixes are important in which bug fixes aren't.

609
00:42:05,454 --> 00:42:06,760
Speaker 0: that's the software engineer's job.

610
00:42:07,322 --> 00:42:15,851
Speaker 0: The software engineer shouldn't have to guess at what's important and what's not important to the business the IT department and through them all the other departments of the company.

611
00:42:16,092 --> 00:42:19,427
Speaker 0: there should be some sort of process for managing that and As you can see.

612
00:42:19,447 --> 00:42:20,296
Speaker 0: I could go on and on.

613
00:42:20,901 --> 00:42:21,986
Speaker 0: IT is everything.

614
00:42:22,488 --> 00:42:25,180
Speaker 0: IT is both the simplest and the most complex part of an organization.

615
00:42:25,421 --> 00:42:32,412
Speaker 0: IT is the most misunderstood part of any organization and Almost no one in the world is trained in what IT actually is.

616
00:42:32,473 --> 00:42:36,046
Speaker 0: so you can see where there might be problems Maybe maybe.

617
00:42:36,227 --> 00:42:46,559
Speaker 0: so what I want to do in you know My coming shows is I'm gonna break IT up into as tiny chunks as I can and talk about them in as much detail As I think you can handle.

618
00:42:52,923 --> 00:42:55,532
