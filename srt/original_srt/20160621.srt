1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,791
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, June 21st, 2016.

2
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:13,252
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,272 --> 00:00:15,518
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:24,059
Speaker 1: tonight we talk about people who may or may not know a lot about games and How bad they might be but all in good fun?

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,686
Speaker 1: Thanks to Reddit.

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,019
Speaker 1: I Don't know what the fuck to call this episode.

7
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,245
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

8
00:00:31,807 --> 00:00:34,800
Speaker 1: So we like going to Wildwood like even though it's kind of in the bottom of New Jersey.

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,232
Speaker 1: we have a long history of going to Wildwood and like friends and it's just.

10
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:42,307
Speaker 1: it's a. it's a very nostalgic place and For the East Coast of the US.

11
00:00:42,347 --> 00:00:45,600
Speaker 1: It's one of the best beaches in terms of actual sand beach.

12
00:00:47,022 --> 00:00:49,570
Speaker 0: You know, even in Florida is technically still the East Coast.

13
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,055
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Northeast Coast.

14
00:00:51,817 --> 00:00:52,800
Speaker 0: I mean, there's Virginia.

15
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,173
Speaker 0: I guess it's below the Mason-Dixon line, but Virginia and a Virginia Beach.

16
00:00:56,494 --> 00:00:57,298
Speaker 0: I've seen pictures of it.

17
00:00:57,318 --> 00:00:57,880
Speaker 1: We've been to it.

18
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,511
Speaker 1: It's usually crowded and kind of meh.

19
00:00:59,954 --> 00:01:00,920
Speaker 0: Oh, it looked nice in the picture.

20
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:02,329
Speaker 1: I mean a lot of things I never been.

21
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:03,960
Speaker 1: Rockaway looks real nice in the picture.

22
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,485
Speaker 0: It is nice.

23
00:01:05,506 --> 00:01:08,381
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wouldn't swim there that long Mmm.

24
00:01:08,722 --> 00:01:08,963
Speaker 1: Yeah.

25
00:01:09,304 --> 00:01:12,032
Speaker 1: So anyway, I do worse, but I tend to don't go.

26
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:17,752
Speaker 1: it like I'll bike to Rockaway, but then I don't like Change into swimsuits and swim or like spend.

27
00:01:17,772 --> 00:01:19,439
Speaker 0: it is where the fuck am I gonna put my bike?

28
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,532
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm in the water and then what I'm gonna bike back wet.

29
00:01:23,034 --> 00:01:24,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, how is that gonna work?

30
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:37,260
Speaker 1: so Emily and I this Logistics are not there tipped off by Gothamis because apparently this seems like it's a relatively new thing and it's one of those things that Eventually like regular New Yorkers are gonna figure it out and ruin it for all of us.

31
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:48,413
Speaker 1: But right now there's this express ferry that goes from 35th Street like that ferry terminal Yeah direct to Sandy Hook Beach Which I didn't actually even know existed.

32
00:01:48,433 --> 00:01:50,262
Speaker 0: It's just a North Jersey Beach it's at that.

33
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:50,925
Speaker 1: so it's be.

34
00:01:50,965 --> 00:02:00,140
Speaker 1: it's north of North Jersey because there's Jersey kind of like goes up to that point and the Barrier Islands to the right and all the Jersey Shore places are in the barrier like islands the barrier peninsulas.

35
00:02:00,783 --> 00:02:11,260
Speaker 1: But to get to this beach driving you have to go all the way around Into North Jersey and then turn left and go up north to actually get to it like it's popping up over the top.

36
00:02:11,905 --> 00:02:17,654
Speaker 1: From the beach you can actually see Manhattan and like the Verrazano Narrows bridge and all that crap like it's it's.

37
00:02:17,734 --> 00:02:23,060
Speaker 1: it's like kind of like off the coast of Staten Island And I just never really thought about that place and from New York.

38
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:31,746
Speaker 1: It would be a super pain in the ass to get there Like it's actually harder to get there than to get to other beaches that are further south Unless you take a boat.

39
00:02:32,428 --> 00:02:35,598
Speaker 1: So this boat is like 30 bucks round trip.

40
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:41,140
Speaker 1: That's a lot of monies Yeah But it's way less money than car or any other way to get to this beach.

41
00:02:41,381 --> 00:02:44,359
Speaker 1: In fact, if you drive to the beach, it costs like 20 bucks just to park there.

42
00:02:45,301 --> 00:02:49,115
Speaker 1: So the ferry takes like 40 minutes gets us right to the beach.

43
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:52,326
Speaker 1: There's bike pads Everywhere up there.

44
00:02:52,386 --> 00:02:53,331
Speaker 1: There's like no cars.

45
00:02:53,351 --> 00:02:54,215
Speaker 1: You can bike everywhere.

46
00:02:54,255 --> 00:02:55,120
Speaker 1: It's like great biking.

47
00:02:56,081 --> 00:02:58,272
Speaker 1: There's like four beaches and they're great beaches.

48
00:02:58,634 --> 00:02:59,720
Speaker 1: The water is super clean.

49
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:06,332
Speaker 1: It's clearer and cleaner feeling than Wildwood's water Even though and apparently I was reading up about the beach.

50
00:03:06,593 --> 00:03:11,328
Speaker 1: It's because of where it's situated It's sort of shielded from the New York stuff.

51
00:03:11,348 --> 00:03:15,920
Speaker 1: So it's like very different water quality from all the other beaches in the New York area.

52
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:19,172
Speaker 1: it's more like swimming way further south would be normally.

53
00:03:20,055 --> 00:03:25,499
Speaker 1: and the other interesting thing is There used to be a nuclear anti-aircraft battery on this island.

54
00:03:25,982 --> 00:03:30,944
Speaker 1: So there's museums and like all this nuclear anti-aircraft show It's trying to shoot nukes.

55
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,211
Speaker 0: theoretically would shoot nukes at planes.

56
00:03:33,312 --> 00:03:33,592
Speaker 1: Yes.

57
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:35,820
Speaker 0: The idea was that is a bad idea.

58
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:40,440
Speaker 1: So this is in the 50s and I knew a little bit about this, but I didn't know they couldn't hit the plane.

59
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,920
Speaker 0: So they figure well just shoot a big enough aoe it is way worse than that.

60
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,713
Speaker 1: So we had the Nike missiles right like Nike Ajax.

61
00:03:47,914 --> 00:03:49,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, they weren't very good.

62
00:03:49,441 --> 00:03:49,823
Speaker 1: Well, they were.

63
00:03:50,084 --> 00:03:53,619
Speaker 1: so the original missile had a conventional explosive and it would shoot up.

64
00:03:54,061 --> 00:03:56,632
Speaker 1: It was the first like missile rocket artillery.

65
00:03:56,873 --> 00:03:59,402
Speaker 1: It would shoot up and hit a bomber Awesome.

66
00:03:59,803 --> 00:04:01,227
Speaker 0: Yeah bombers big and easy to hit.

67
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:06,109
Speaker 1: and they had this because they were worried about a Soviet nuclear bomber coming in to nuke New York.

68
00:04:06,436 --> 00:04:08,487
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean that was a good plan.

69
00:04:08,547 --> 00:04:15,660
Speaker 1: and then the Cold War progressed a little bit and instead of the worry being One Soviet bomber it was squadron of Soviet bombers.

70
00:04:16,202 --> 00:04:20,820
Speaker 1: So the idea was why don't we just blow up a nuke over New York to blow up all the bombers?

71
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:22,547
Speaker 0: Why don't you just use your fighters?

72
00:04:22,567 --> 00:04:24,114
Speaker 0: you can shoot the bombers down.

73
00:04:24,134 --> 00:04:25,460
Speaker 0: they're big and slow.

74
00:04:26,481 --> 00:04:28,480
Speaker 1: There's reasons for that and our fighters are better.

75
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,432
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna turn the front of the show into why it was the way it was.

76
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:37,520
Speaker 1: but I'll put it this way I thought we were looking at it cuz I didn't know a lot about like the Nike Ajax Nike Hercules.

77
00:04:37,681 --> 00:04:40,490
Speaker 1: I knew a little bit just cuz that's like basic war history.

78
00:04:41,132 --> 00:04:41,894
Speaker 0: So which?

79
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:43,500
Speaker 0: which part of this is left at the beach?

80
00:04:44,103 --> 00:04:47,540
Speaker 1: So the whole fucking thing like the batteries are there dishes nukes there waiting.

81
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:52,240
Speaker 1: So obviously the nuke payload is not in them anymore the fuel is not in them anymore.

82
00:04:52,561 --> 00:04:53,084
Speaker 1: but there's like.

83
00:04:53,145 --> 00:04:55,798
Speaker 1: they've got him there as like museum pieces for you to check out.

84
00:04:55,818 --> 00:04:58,590
Speaker 0: and They've got like whenever you go to the veterans place.

85
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,500
Speaker 0: There's like a missile out in the front and it's empty.

86
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:01,563
Speaker 0: It's a big metal.

87
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:02,747
Speaker 1: Here's what's terrifying.

88
00:05:03,068 --> 00:05:09,111
Speaker 1: They're really small two-stage missiles and looking at him I was like can't be that big a yield.

89
00:05:09,151 --> 00:05:10,177
Speaker 1: I mean this would be used for air.

90
00:05:10,821 --> 00:05:11,223
Speaker 1: It was like.

91
00:05:11,405 --> 00:05:12,169
Speaker 1: what are these like?

92
00:05:12,552 --> 00:05:13,175
Speaker 1: maybe like.

93
00:05:13,196 --> 00:05:13,920
Speaker 1: are they a kiloton?

94
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:16,226
Speaker 1: No, these things are fucking like.

95
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:18,572
Speaker 1: I think it went up to 80 or 90 kilotons.

96
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:20,477
Speaker 1: We're talking nine Hiroshima's.

97
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:27,938
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, the radar array is there and apparently on special days I got the schedule.

98
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:28,560
Speaker 1: I want to go back.

99
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:33,193
Speaker 1: They do tours of the actual facility where all this shit is now.

100
00:05:33,213 --> 00:05:33,814
Speaker 1: They'd only do it.

101
00:05:34,236 --> 00:05:35,760
Speaker 0: They do it like pike your bike.

102
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,168
Speaker 1: Yeah, I probably parked our bike outside everywhere.

103
00:05:38,188 --> 00:05:41,600
Speaker 1: There was totally safe now granted, but there was safety in numbers one.

104
00:05:41,761 --> 00:05:43,306
Speaker 1: Everyone bikes everywhere on this island.

105
00:05:43,326 --> 00:05:44,490
Speaker 1: There's bike racks everywhere.

106
00:05:45,233 --> 00:05:47,200
Speaker 1: You can't get cars near the bike racks.

107
00:05:47,782 --> 00:05:51,859
Speaker 1: So so like the kinds of bike theory they're going to Manhattan can't really happen there.

108
00:05:53,363 --> 00:05:56,120
Speaker 1: New York riffraff can't easily get there because the expensive ferry.

109
00:05:56,601 --> 00:06:04,282
Speaker 1: New Jersey riffraff can't easily get there because it's a long drive and you have to pay a lot of money to park there or bike in Bike.

110
00:06:04,302 --> 00:06:05,686
Speaker 1: that every seems a pretty uncommon.

111
00:06:05,726 --> 00:06:07,692
Speaker 1: there like most people weren't even locking their bikes up.

112
00:06:08,054 --> 00:06:09,920
Speaker 1: But no we fucking locked our bikes up.

113
00:06:11,022 --> 00:06:14,013
Speaker 1: No one stole them though, but partly because we both have beefy locks.

114
00:06:14,354 --> 00:06:17,406
Speaker 1: so we locked our bikes together Mutually to the pole.

115
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:20,500
Speaker 1: So if the three of us went daddy three locks.

116
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:28,380
Speaker 1: But yeah, so there's all these batteries there like old batteries from like early World War one and late Civil War.

117
00:06:28,782 --> 00:06:32,080
Speaker 1: There's so much cool history on the island and great beaches.

118
00:06:32,987 --> 00:06:34,158
Speaker 1: One of the beaches is special.

119
00:06:35,163 --> 00:06:44,100
Speaker 1: There's like a bunch of beaches at different places along the island but one of the beaches is Technically owned by the federal government and is not New Jersey state land.

120
00:06:44,942 --> 00:06:47,330
Speaker 1: So you can have alcohol on the beach.

121
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:52,848
Speaker 1: There are basically no rules except federal rules on the beach and You can be naked on the beach.

122
00:06:52,908 --> 00:06:55,220
Speaker 0: So it's the new for tilden is the same way then.

123
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:04,460
Speaker 1: Yeah but unlike this beach has a like all these beaches here also have a lot of Facilities and way better showers and changing rooms and things than a lot of beaches.

124
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,526
Speaker 1: So it was just a great place.

125
00:07:06,587 --> 00:07:11,276
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go there a bunch of times, but not immediately cuz Kind of got a little bit sunburned.

126
00:07:12,442 --> 00:07:13,360
Speaker 0: Why did you bring lotions?

127
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:14,342
Speaker 1: I went.

128
00:07:14,362 --> 00:07:18,880
Speaker 1: I did a lot of swim in and I rubbed it off and didn't correctly fully reapply.

129
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:22,129
Speaker 1: So my sides where I like my arms rubbed it off.

130
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:26,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's bad news bears another problem with swimming mid bike.

131
00:07:26,703 --> 00:07:29,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is what we did is we biked around for like a few hours.

132
00:07:29,561 --> 00:07:29,963
Speaker 1: Then we went.

133
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:31,650
Speaker 0: it's also a problem with the nude beach.

134
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:34,100
Speaker 0: right suddenly you got a lotion in all the places.

135
00:07:34,545 --> 00:07:42,960
Speaker 1: Honestly, if I'm in a nude beach I'm not gonna be super nude cuz I am NOT going to ever risk burning the young master and his merry man.

136
00:07:43,428 --> 00:07:44,482
Speaker 1: Holy shit Is that?

137
00:07:44,542 --> 00:07:46,872
Speaker 1: literally one of my biggest fears is a sunburn down.

138
00:07:47,073 --> 00:07:48,619
Speaker 0: all peeling off can't use it.

139
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,559
Speaker 0: Okay, when every time you pee you got to touch it.

140
00:07:51,640 --> 00:08:04,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, especially because this we would not have been nearly so bad when I was the younger man Cuz I used to wear boxes all the time, but son as you get older, it's box of briefs time and Box of briefs plus the sunburn down there.

141
00:08:04,071 --> 00:08:05,900
Speaker 1: I feel like I just would call in sick.

142
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,930
Speaker 0: I mean even just sun burning your ass is not good.

143
00:08:08,151 --> 00:08:08,794
Speaker 0: You sit down.

144
00:08:09,276 --> 00:08:09,417
Speaker 0: Ow.

145
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:19,020
Speaker 0: Yeah It doesn't matter what you wear and I think I'd wear unless unless you're wearing like a freeze ice pack like a mushy gel one.

146
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:27,160
Speaker 1: But yeah, I plan to go to this beach on a semi-regular imagine like rubbing cool aloe like all over your butt.

147
00:08:27,408 --> 00:08:33,715
Speaker 1: Yeah So I was just cool and you should check it out and I'm gonna find out when I can go see.

148
00:08:33,735 --> 00:08:42,760
Speaker 1: because apparently like I suspect There are still some sort of like anti-aircraft things there because there's a lot of military personnel who work there still.

149
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:48,360
Speaker 1: So the tours of the nuclear shit are like tightly controlled on certain specific days gonna shoot somebody.

150
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,547
Speaker 1: Also, the park service is like all over this place.

151
00:08:51,587 --> 00:08:56,199
Speaker 1: So like there's all these old gigantic gun batteries and abandoned forts and everything.

152
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,186
Speaker 1: and There's park services.

153
00:08:58,206 --> 00:09:03,220
Speaker 1: people just stand in there and if you bike up They're like, hey you want to come inside and like check this shit out.

154
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:09,560
Speaker 1: They give you a flashlight and a hardhat and they're like Let's go and they just tell you all the history and answer any questions and they're all a hundred percent chill.

155
00:09:12,101 --> 00:09:17,828
Speaker 1: That's what their job is is stand there and all day every day what I do in the winter In the winter, you can still go to this island.

156
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:18,692
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of stuff there.

157
00:09:19,536 --> 00:09:20,460
Speaker 0: It's a pretty weird job.

158
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,692
Speaker 1: Yeah, Park Service is kind of awesome.

159
00:09:22,732 --> 00:09:23,598
Speaker 1: I wish we had more of that.

160
00:09:25,141 --> 00:09:26,184
Speaker 1: So, yeah, that was my weekend.

161
00:09:26,204 --> 00:09:28,671
Speaker 0: hmm, I just biked to normal places.

162
00:09:28,832 --> 00:09:31,520
Speaker 0: now don't have to spend money in our in, New Jersey.

163
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:34,789
Speaker 1: Well, I was on federal land for a part of it.

164
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:37,099
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't go to the federal lands this weekend.

165
00:09:38,601 --> 00:09:45,406
Speaker 1: So, uh in the actual news you got any news cuz it's gaming day and such Fiasco people are talking about here right?

166
00:09:45,566 --> 00:09:46,288
Speaker 1: Oh a fiasco.

167
00:09:46,308 --> 00:09:47,632
Speaker 0: No sort of a fiasco.

168
00:09:47,752 --> 00:09:48,735
Speaker 1: the game fiasco.

169
00:09:49,517 --> 00:09:50,359
Speaker 0: So basic now.

170
00:09:51,921 --> 00:09:54,931
Speaker 0: So there was basically there's this company tiny bill.

171
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:55,915
Speaker 0: is it called tiny build?

172
00:09:56,115 --> 00:09:57,099
Speaker 0: it's called something like that.

173
00:09:58,563 --> 00:09:58,987
Speaker 0: What happened?

174
00:09:59,007 --> 00:09:59,834
Speaker 0: I lost the link.

175
00:10:00,197 --> 00:10:02,887
Speaker 1: Oh Radio silence gig judges off the air.

176
00:10:02,907 --> 00:10:09,646
Speaker 1: I'm gonna fill it with patter until Scott comes back online with this link on his iPad I guess And I'm running out of steam.

177
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,393
Speaker 1: So I'm playing a lot of overwatch.

178
00:10:11,634 --> 00:10:12,840
Speaker 1: I can start talking about overwatch.

179
00:10:13,422 --> 00:10:18,260
Speaker 1: I figured out how to deal with the situation where you're pushing and it's over time.

180
00:10:18,782 --> 00:10:21,734
Speaker 0: They took a link off the top of the page so I had to like scroll down to find it.

181
00:10:21,874 --> 00:10:26,129
Speaker 0: that is a tiny build Which made some games like speedrunners and games.

182
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:28,256
Speaker 0: I never heard of whatever they.

183
00:10:28,477 --> 00:10:32,259
Speaker 0: basically here's what happened They set up a website to sell their game.

184
00:10:32,661 --> 00:10:34,308
Speaker 0: So you go to their website tiny build.

185
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:37,160
Speaker 0: you buy the game and they give you a steam code.

186
00:10:37,582 --> 00:10:39,229
Speaker 0: Then you use the steam code and you have the game.

187
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:41,931
Speaker 0: this way instead of buying the game on steam you buy the game from them.

188
00:10:42,821 --> 00:10:44,931
Speaker 1: Right, yep real common sure whatever.

189
00:10:45,615 --> 00:10:50,269
Speaker 0: so there's this other website G2a which is apparently the shadiest of shady fucks.

190
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:53,720
Speaker 0: and what g2a does is basically let you resell game codes.

191
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:58,519
Speaker 0: So you would buy a game code or maybe you have a game that you don't want or already.

192
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:04,620
Speaker 1: That's the kind of thing that if I didn't know what I like what I know about the game industry I'd be thinking that sounds like a pretty cool side.

193
00:11:04,861 --> 00:11:07,512
Speaker 0: I mean in principle that's perfectly okay, right.

194
00:11:07,532 --> 00:11:14,613
Speaker 0: if I buy a humble bundle and there's a game I already got and I don't want to gift the game to anyone or whatever Why shouldn't I be able to sell that code right?

195
00:11:14,794 --> 00:11:18,819
Speaker 0: It's a writer for a sale And you know in that aspect g2a is fine, right?

196
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:26,071
Speaker 0: So you go on g2a you put your code someone else buys it from you they get the code They use it on steam what and they get the big at the game, right?

197
00:11:26,332 --> 00:11:28,400
Speaker 0: It's that's nothing wrong with that in principle.

198
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:38,887
Speaker 0: apparently though g2a is like shady as fuck and they really don't give a crap if like people are selling bullshit codes or Whatever.

199
00:11:38,947 --> 00:11:55,740
Speaker 0: so the scam is this people go out and they look for People selling game codes that have shitty web stores like tiny bills own personal store And they use fraudulent stolen credit cards to buy codes.

200
00:11:56,442 --> 00:12:00,960
Speaker 0: They resell the codes on g2a to basically money launder them and get tournaments like real money.

201
00:12:01,744 --> 00:12:04,760
Speaker 0: Then obviously the transaction gets cancelled.

202
00:12:05,262 --> 00:12:09,997
Speaker 0: So now the person with the original store has given away the game the code.

203
00:12:10,037 --> 00:12:14,539
Speaker 0: that's gonna work But now they don't get any money because it was a fraudulent credit card.

204
00:12:15,162 --> 00:12:23,199
Speaker 0: But meanwhile now it's the person who used the stolen credit card has the money because they resold the code I like a good price or even you know discount or whatever.

205
00:12:23,902 --> 00:12:28,320
Speaker 0: So the game got given to some legitimate gamer who bought the code who wants to play it.

206
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:38,171
Speaker 0: So sometimes I think in certain cases what they've done is they've like, you know invalidated those codes And now someone paid money to a scammer and now doesn't even have a game.

207
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:38,713
Speaker 0: Yep.

208
00:12:38,793 --> 00:12:39,295
Speaker 1: Now granted.

209
00:12:39,335 --> 00:12:40,840
Speaker 0: I see ever still has the money.

210
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,245
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

211
00:12:42,546 --> 00:12:55,210
Speaker 0: So the two I think that you know, everyone here is blaming g2a which yeah You should blame g2a because basically it appears they don't give a fuck about shit like this and they're like Okay, they're just so scammy and don't give a crap.

212
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:58,020
Speaker 0: and they're like, hooray we're making so much money from these scammers.

213
00:12:58,201 --> 00:13:00,392
Speaker 0: Please continue selling shady shit.

214
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:04,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, but also Some blame needs to be put on.

215
00:13:05,463 --> 00:13:07,840
Speaker 0: You know, I guess there it's sort of victim blaming.

216
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:10,300
Speaker 0: It's sort of like oh you didn't lock your door and your house got robbed.

217
00:13:10,661 --> 00:13:15,480
Speaker 0: But at the same time you're really dumb if you don't even lock your door to your house and you have valuable shit in there.

218
00:13:15,701 --> 00:13:17,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't make your own fucking web store.

219
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,756
Speaker 0: It's like everyone complains that like Apple or steam or whoever is taking a cut.

220
00:13:22,118 --> 00:13:28,100
Speaker 1: dude guys We tried to Scott and I like we were gonna do some e-commerce way back and I started setting them a magento server.

221
00:13:28,362 --> 00:13:31,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, fuck that never you pay someone else.

222
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:33,652
Speaker 0: Someone else is taking a cut.

223
00:13:33,672 --> 00:13:37,247
Speaker 0: So they set up their own web store and Yeah, cuz you know what.

224
00:13:37,307 --> 00:13:39,956
Speaker 0: now they're like, I think they said they were so upset.

225
00:13:39,996 --> 00:13:44,890
Speaker 0: It's like we've spent more time developing Anti credit card fraud than developing games.

226
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,456
Speaker 0: It's like why are you developing that?

227
00:13:46,496 --> 00:13:47,460
Speaker 0: you could have just bought it?

228
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:54,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, or instead of bonding it you could have just paid someone else like Apple the cut they take which is going towards things like this.

229
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:56,732
Speaker 1: That's you know Cuz I've.

230
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:56,939
Speaker 1: you know.

231
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:03,180
Speaker 1: I work on Wall Street like in my day job and one of the primary like arguments and discussions that always happens is build versus buy.

232
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,545
Speaker 1: Do you build something or buy it?

233
00:14:04,806 --> 00:14:08,360
Speaker 1: The answer is almost never to build it unless it's your primary thing.

234
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,015
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there right unless it's the thing making you money just buy someone else's right.

235
00:14:12,076 --> 00:14:16,072
Speaker 0: and it was even like I think like one or two weeks ago, John Oliver did a thing about.

236
00:14:16,092 --> 00:14:18,200
Speaker 0: do you let people know about you know?

237
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:25,010
Speaker 0: Something we knew already which is like hey, yeah mutual funds and have mad fees on them Right, but it's like he wasn't.

238
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,214
Speaker 0: even he wasn't like.

239
00:14:26,395 --> 00:14:27,700
Speaker 0: yeah find one with no fees.

240
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:35,207
Speaker 0: It's like no because your fee is still buying you something which is a smart person buying stuff You don't have to right it's not?

241
00:14:35,227 --> 00:14:38,440
Speaker 1: you don't watch out for robo advisors because that's kind of making that less and less.

242
00:14:38,663 --> 00:14:39,379
Speaker 0: But yeah, no.

243
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,864
Speaker 0: But the point is is right is it?

244
00:14:41,105 --> 00:14:56,603
Speaker 0: if you want to do something without having to work this fees to cover shit like this Yep, right, so kind of like if you're a tiny build and you lose apparently they say they've lost $450,000 right Because of this.

245
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:57,065
Speaker 0: it's like.

246
00:14:57,085 --> 00:15:01,240
Speaker 0: that's what you get for opening up your own goddamn store and doing something that isn't your own deal.

247
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:07,400
Speaker 0: You should have just sold your stuff on Amazon and Google and Apple and let them take the cut and steam whatever.

248
00:15:07,581 --> 00:15:10,229
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the primary blame still falls on the scammers.

249
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,055
Speaker 0: Obviously if G that's the other thing.

250
00:15:12,095 --> 00:15:27,542
Speaker 0: if g2a didn't exist Right and wasn't doing this or it wasn't being shady there would be even if you bought these codes of stolen credit cards You'd have no way to turn those code to launder those codes into money and there would be no point in buying codes of stolen credit

251
00:15:27,582 --> 00:15:27,843
Speaker 1: card.

252
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:36,391
Speaker 1: companies also are a little culpable because they have a lot of capacity to Recognize trends of fraudulent use and deal with that.

253
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:38,898
Speaker 0: they do do some extent but they don't do it.

254
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:39,700
Speaker 0: It's it's weird.

255
00:15:39,781 --> 00:15:44,660
Speaker 0: It's like if I use my card at like a store I never go to it won't work and I'll get a phone call.

256
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:51,459
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if some legit stolen credit cards are used to buy game codes like a thousand times at the same store They don't do anything.

257
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,160
Speaker 0: It's like I don't know what their anti-fraud system is.

258
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:59,664
Speaker 1: But so actually my credit card number got stolen a bunch of times in rapid succession due to a breach I think with a bank or whatever.

259
00:15:59,704 --> 00:16:16,493
Speaker 1: like there's a credit card processing or there's some sort of big like super top-level breaches years ago and every time it got stolen and used for until like finally just stopped because The big high up person had fixed it It was always at the same Target store in like.

260
00:16:16,573 --> 00:16:17,135
Speaker 1: Tennessee.

261
00:16:17,256 --> 00:16:18,520
Speaker 0: wasn't target the place they had a breach.

262
00:16:19,285 --> 00:16:21,380
Speaker 1: I might have been but I haven't shopped at the target like ever.

263
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,044
Speaker 1: Yeah So it wasn't.

264
00:16:23,204 --> 00:16:25,892
Speaker 1: it was my credit card number was not breached because of Target.

265
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:31,219
Speaker 1: just Target was the store where people were using the fraudulent Credit cards that they cloned or whatever to make purchases.

266
00:16:32,363 --> 00:16:33,230
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's really.

267
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:44,097
Speaker 0: it's also the law's fault Right because if I was the government I would just say credit card companies as in Visa MasterCard American Express You're responsible for all of the costs associated with not merchants not customers.

268
00:16:44,138 --> 00:16:44,680
Speaker 0: Not anyone else.

269
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,588
Speaker 0: It's gonna be you no matter what and you what they would.

270
00:16:46,668 --> 00:16:52,051
Speaker 1: I would say then you can't use credit cards online at all Unless you have a chip reader in your house plugged into your computer.

271
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:55,390
Speaker 0: and then I would say no You just have to fucking deal with it.

272
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:55,672
Speaker 0: visa.

273
00:16:55,713 --> 00:16:58,365
Speaker 0: Fuck you because That's the law we passed.

274
00:16:58,405 --> 00:17:01,155
Speaker 1: This is why you're not president nor you're a member of Congress.

275
00:17:01,216 --> 00:17:02,260
Speaker 0: Why not deal with it?

276
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:07,236
Speaker 0: Okay, you have your multi bajillion dollar international company like visa.

277
00:17:07,577 --> 00:17:08,400
Speaker 0: fucking deal with it.

278
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:10,309
Speaker 0: If this loss is involved you eat him.

279
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:10,992
Speaker 0: Fuck you.

280
00:17:11,012 --> 00:17:12,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can have plenty of fuck.

281
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:13,864
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go that route.

282
00:17:13,884 --> 00:17:14,928
Speaker 1: There's a better way.

283
00:17:15,008 --> 00:17:15,891
Speaker 0: What's the better way?

284
00:17:15,931 --> 00:17:18,619
Speaker 1: You just fucking nationalize the credit card.

285
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,867
Speaker 0: That's a great idea too.

286
00:17:20,008 --> 00:17:21,255
Speaker 1: You don't tell the private company.

287
00:17:21,295 --> 00:17:22,160
Speaker 1: Fuck you do what we want.

288
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,760
Speaker 1: You say you're a public company now, that'd be fine, too.

289
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:27,493
Speaker 1: I owned by the public as in the federal government.

290
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:28,560
Speaker 0: that actually sounds great, too.

291
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,111
Speaker 0: I'd be like, hey guess what Visa MasterCard and American Express relating all of you.

292
00:17:32,131 --> 00:17:35,020
Speaker 0: There's not one thing it's called US card system.

293
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,875
Speaker 1: Yeah, listeners guys realize like we're pretty radically far left on a lot of issues.

294
00:17:39,915 --> 00:17:40,718
Speaker 0: I'm okay with that.

295
00:17:40,758 --> 00:17:44,029
Speaker 1: It sounds great But there's also like the.

296
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,900
Speaker 0: there's a little bit and you know what?

297
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,190
Speaker 0: You could also get rid of all those stupid things that you know, like you get your ATM card And there's all those weird symbols in the back.

298
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like rich ATM.

299
00:17:53,121 --> 00:17:55,560
Speaker 0: Can I you can get rid of all those two and join them in the same system?

300
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:06,519
Speaker 1: So a little bit of blame goes on the people who buy stuff on g2a Because when you see a game for sale for like a penny or a dollar somewhere That's there's almost no way that's legit.

301
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:12,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, sure, but you know also like I at least that person's a legit gamer.

302
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,131
Speaker 0: They're probably a poor high school kid with no money.

303
00:18:14,172 --> 00:18:15,400
Speaker 0: Who's the only way they can get a game?

304
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,450
Speaker 1: I looked at you to his website for the first time.

305
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,339
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would have assumed it was a scam.

306
00:18:20,129 --> 00:18:22,485
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the site I'm never gonna give like dude.

307
00:18:22,525 --> 00:18:26,077
Speaker 1: at the top it has a little money bag sign and it says g2a gold mine.

308
00:18:26,158 --> 00:18:27,288
Speaker 1: earn real money with us.

309
00:18:27,553 --> 00:18:32,618
Speaker 1: no Oh The site sets off all my fishing radar, yeah.

310
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,443
Speaker 1: So g2a.

311
00:18:34,463 --> 00:18:38,340
Speaker 0: yeah, if you want to buy a game just but it's like dude the steam sale isn't cheap enough for you.

312
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:44,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, how to go to cheetah you're bitching about paying, you know, five dollars instead of a dollar on a shady side.

313
00:18:44,643 --> 00:18:45,470
Speaker 1: Come on, guys.

314
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:49,860
Speaker 1: I Mean, I bought overwatch like immediately a full price, but that game's not gonna get cheaper.

315
00:18:50,423 --> 00:18:51,709
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think there's also.

316
00:18:51,729 --> 00:18:54,060
Speaker 0: I think part of it is that with g2a you can you know?

317
00:18:54,261 --> 00:18:57,960
Speaker 0: If you don't have a credit card or some punk kid you can earn money doing g2a nonsense.

318
00:18:58,181 --> 00:19:05,825
Speaker 1: Yeah, and by games with you know, that's that's exactly I was about to get to that because that is the game store model as Well, I trade in your games.

319
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:17,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, I feel like that business model of target kids You can't get credit cards should not be allowed and simultaneously There should be an easier way to give kids credit cards that their parents control.

320
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:25,989
Speaker 0: You should be able to go into any bank Even if you're gonna give them cash and they should have to give you a card That is worth that amount of cash that can be.

321
00:19:26,009 --> 00:19:29,040
Speaker 1: well you can do that like any target or Rite Aid or whatever.

322
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,325
Speaker 0: Yeah, you get a gift card.

323
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,298
Speaker 1: No, you can buy like visa debit cards or whatever.

324
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:34,946
Speaker 0: Yeah, sure But sometimes those don't work.

325
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:40,560
Speaker 1: No, I'm saying like when I was a young kid, like I was a teenager I was like lucky because you know, my parents were internet and I was internet.

326
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:45,340
Speaker 1: So they got me a credit card when I was really young that they were also on the account.

327
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,755
Speaker 1: So even as a punk kid, I could use a credit card to do stuff online.

328
00:19:49,097 --> 00:19:52,780
Speaker 1: in the modern era It is ridiculous that 13 year olds can't have credit cards.

329
00:19:53,121 --> 00:19:57,156
Speaker 1: I mean I when I was 13 year old needs a credit card like they need a smartphone.

330
00:19:57,216 --> 00:20:02,315
Speaker 0: when I was in high school I bought stuff by buying it online and then mailing a check to the place.

331
00:20:02,616 --> 00:20:04,978
Speaker 0: Wow that worked It's real well.

332
00:20:05,542 --> 00:20:12,145
Speaker 0: And then when I was in college rim was like I. the reason I didn't get a credit card was simply because I figured I Didn't have any credit.

333
00:20:12,185 --> 00:20:14,380
Speaker 0: They wouldn't send me one and rim was like they'll totally send you one.

334
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,060
Speaker 0: So I went to a website and he filled out the form and sure enough a credit card came in the mail.

335
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,171
Speaker 0: I'm like, oh, okay.

336
00:20:19,454 --> 00:20:32,460
Speaker 1: We're good But like in the modern era it's ridiculous to expect a 12 year old to not have a cell phone And it's ridiculous to expect the 12 year old shouldn't have cards They can use to interact with the modern world of currency and commercial transactions.

337
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:36,280
Speaker 1: So in other news, this is sort of an interesting thing.

338
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,749
Speaker 1: So overwatch is getting you know patches and updates and everything.

339
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:52,760
Speaker 1: but Jeff Kaplan who is the game director Actually posted a very long sort of discussion of The changes they're making and the rationale and basically everything around the matchmaking in overwatch and the matchmaking.

340
00:20:52,820 --> 00:21:03,300
Speaker 1: those are guys like the most advanced matchmaking on earth that they do and Overwatch is in the he even admitted is basically a special problem even more so than other games of its ilk.

341
00:21:04,743 --> 00:21:06,114
Speaker 0: Isn't it the same problem as tf2 or?

342
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:11,920
Speaker 1: Tf2 didn't have that much of a skill cap and the characters weren't actually that much different?

343
00:21:12,248 --> 00:21:12,700
Speaker 0: I guess yeah.

344
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:18,620
Speaker 0: If there's less skill then it doesn't matter as much who you're paired with because you can you'll you have much more leeway.

345
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:26,420
Speaker 0: It's like if you miss pair people it won't make it won't ruin the game as much Whereas if you miss pair and a high skill cap game, right that one person is gonna kill everybody.

346
00:21:26,527 --> 00:21:27,744
Speaker 1: also the matches are very different.

347
00:21:27,764 --> 00:21:34,831
Speaker 1: like the matches function more like a sports game in terms of how they're structured than a Server of capture the flag or whatever like it.

348
00:21:35,534 --> 00:21:39,539
Speaker 1: I'm doing a review in the game So I'll kind of sidestep just explaining what I mean by all that.

349
00:21:40,061 --> 00:21:56,380
Speaker 1: But also because of the grouping like it's six on six and you can pick from all these different characters and the characters are So radically different and you can change characters mid-match And you're expected to like I'll run while like I'll run diva for half the match.

350
00:21:56,641 --> 00:22:00,839
Speaker 1: But then during a clutch moment I switch to Winston and they go back to diva like people do stuff like that.

351
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:09,798
Speaker 1: So the matchmaking is crazy complicated, but the two really interesting things that you should just read this thing I'm not gonna paraphrase it all for you is one.

352
00:22:10,861 --> 00:22:17,300
Speaker 1: He said that if they broadly describe how it works they can summarize match results into five broad buckets.

353
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:18,927
Speaker 1: My team won.

354
00:22:19,249 --> 00:22:22,803
Speaker 1: we beat the other team by a long shot To.

355
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,107
Speaker 1: my team barely won.

356
00:22:24,688 --> 00:22:26,072
Speaker 1: My team barely lost.

357
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,900
Speaker 1: my team lost and it wasn't even close.

358
00:22:29,502 --> 00:22:33,035
Speaker 1: And then the last category is this match was somehow fucked up or broken.

359
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:34,460
Speaker 0: so I dropped out.

360
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,551
Speaker 1: Yeah, like people dropped out.

361
00:22:35,592 --> 00:22:36,400
Speaker 1: It didn't have the max number.

362
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,940
Speaker 1: Play the game like maybe the mat like the ping half of rocket league games.

363
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:50,440
Speaker 1: But what's interesting is that if you ask the average gamer like what kind of game do you want to play?

364
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,440
Speaker 1: They would say that the games they want the most are the two middle ones.

365
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,632
Speaker 1: My team barely won or my team barely lost.

366
00:22:56,673 --> 00:22:57,920
Speaker 0: like that's bullshit the clothes fair.

367
00:22:58,142 --> 00:22:58,811
Speaker 0: I want to win.

368
00:22:59,196 --> 00:22:59,560
Speaker 1: quotes.

369
00:23:00,042 --> 00:23:04,196
Speaker 1: Most players will say they want a match to be either type 2 or type 3 as I described above.

370
00:23:04,256 --> 00:23:05,919
Speaker 1: those sound even barely win Or barely lose.

371
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:11,840
Speaker 1: But I believe when psychology comes into play most players actually expect type 1 or type 2 to be the result.

372
00:23:12,482 --> 00:23:18,140
Speaker 1: Even amazingly a close type 3 the my team barely lost is generally is can turn into a quote.

373
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:21,350
Speaker 1: Highly negative experience for a lot of players.

374
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:27,480
Speaker 0: right people who don't have most gamers on earth Right do not have the competitive mindset.

375
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:35,066
Speaker 0: They do not actually want to measure their skills against the skills of another person and have the result Declare one person more skilled.

376
00:23:35,286 --> 00:23:38,295
Speaker 0: that makes them upset especially if they lose.

377
00:23:38,837 --> 00:23:39,820
Speaker 0: if they win they don't care.

378
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:46,606
Speaker 1: But if they lose it makes them very upset because they in that because they don't just want to win and have a closed game They prefer to win soundly.

379
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:59,284
Speaker 0: to be like this is why games like pandemic and munchkin and all these things are very very popular Especially compared to game, you know, I'm the only people who play games like counter-strike or dota are like, you know hardcore time This is inside.

380
00:23:59,344 --> 00:23:59,625
Speaker 1: I don't know.

381
00:23:59,645 --> 00:24:01,714
Speaker 1: I I heard there's a munchkin CCG like.

382
00:24:01,754 --> 00:24:02,257
Speaker 1: I ignored it.

383
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:02,859
Speaker 1: like I don't know.

384
00:24:03,221 --> 00:24:04,447
Speaker 0: Yep, I watched a video of that.

385
00:24:04,547 --> 00:24:08,106
Speaker 1: Okay, so if I were going to make that game I don't know what the real game is.

386
00:24:08,147 --> 00:24:09,153
Speaker 1: I've literally not looked at it.

387
00:24:09,576 --> 00:24:10,119
Speaker 1: I would make it.

388
00:24:10,441 --> 00:24:20,680
Speaker 1: I'll just keep selling cards forever and there's basically almost no rules of what you can put in your deck and Just the nerd who brings the most fucked up deck will win in any given group.

389
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,583
Speaker 1: It's just like this ARG game almost No, whatever.

390
00:24:24,603 --> 00:24:25,267
Speaker 1: That's what I would do.

391
00:24:25,668 --> 00:24:26,693
Speaker 1: Just give.

392
00:24:26,713 --> 00:24:28,120
Speaker 0: it seems like they made a real game.

393
00:24:28,582 --> 00:24:30,070
Speaker 0: I see that's the problem, but it also.

394
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:35,013
Speaker 0: but it includes silliness of munchkin For example dropping a card and seeing where it lands.

395
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:35,636
Speaker 1: Yes.

396
00:24:35,656 --> 00:24:36,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would go crazy.

397
00:24:36,621 --> 00:24:40,300
Speaker 1: I'd have cards that be like if you're at a penny arcade Expo.

398
00:24:40,501 --> 00:24:43,353
Speaker 1: This monster is worth plus ten levels or whatever.

399
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:44,920
Speaker 1: Like I would go nuts.

400
00:24:45,741 --> 00:24:49,136
Speaker 1: I would make the game less of a game because that I'd make it more like we didn't play.

401
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:49,819
Speaker 1: test this at all.

402
00:24:50,643 --> 00:24:51,487
Speaker 1: But I digress.

403
00:24:51,989 --> 00:24:57,533
Speaker 1: so he talks about that a lot like the matchmaking and how players Will say they want even matches, but really they just want to win.

404
00:24:57,573 --> 00:24:59,160
Speaker 1: but something really fascinating happened.

405
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:09,508
Speaker 1: There's a feature that I've used that I really liked and it's interesting that I did not anticipate the problem with this feature and Blizzard apparently did not anticipate the problem either.

406
00:25:09,529 --> 00:25:12,740
Speaker 1: They're removing the feature now because of this problem.

407
00:25:13,464 --> 00:25:16,240
Speaker 1: I mean smart people might have come up with it if they really thought about it.

408
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:30,240
Speaker 1: But the idea is in this matchmaking system, you know, this is a game you play in public So you can block other people from like your chats or whatever and you can report people for being shitty and Blizzard takes all that Super seriously, but you also have the option to avoid a player.

409
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:43,418
Speaker 1: So if someone's a bitch like there's annoying little shit bird or you know whatever causes them to be annoying or not fun to have on your team or play with you can say avoid this player and It'll take that into account whenever it's matchmaking you.

410
00:25:44,661 --> 00:25:50,800
Speaker 1: What actually happened is that most people would click avoid on anyone who ever beat them.

411
00:25:51,503 --> 00:25:54,137
Speaker 1: they never wanted to play against people who were better than them of course,

412
00:25:54,197 --> 00:25:54,378
Speaker 0: right and

413
00:25:55,901 --> 00:26:05,400
Speaker 1: That started being a huge problem because basically good players could never find games and apparently the way they figured it out Was that one of the best players in the country like in the world?

414
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,095
Speaker 0: He plays Widowmaker the sniper and he's the one that requires the most skill.

415
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:15,220
Speaker 1: Yes this play Oh Widowmaker might be number two in terms of skill But anyway, this person I don't know if it's guy or girl.

416
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:21,333
Speaker 1: I didn't fully read this but basically they were complaining that they could never get matched up Like they'd never find games.

417
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:22,039
Speaker 1: it would take forever.

418
00:26:23,102 --> 00:26:26,140
Speaker 1: Let me see if I can find the actual quote because it was real interesting.

419
00:26:27,521 --> 00:26:29,368
Speaker 0: Even other really skilled people didn't want to play.

420
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:31,315
Speaker 1: Well, you've got to find a match.

421
00:26:31,355 --> 00:26:31,877
Speaker 1: They could be it.

422
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:32,399
Speaker 1: Here it is.

423
00:26:35,108 --> 00:26:35,879
Speaker 1: Read this whole thing.

424
00:26:36,282 --> 00:26:37,307
Speaker 1: We realized the avoid.

425
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:39,237
Speaker 1: this player was wreaking havoc on matchmaking.

426
00:26:40,383 --> 00:26:48,397
Speaker 1: One of the best Widowmaker players in the world complained to us about long queue times We looked into it and found that hundreds of other players had avoided him quote.

427
00:26:48,577 --> 00:26:49,220
Speaker 1: He's a nice guy.

428
00:26:50,061 --> 00:26:54,920
Speaker 1: They avoided him because they did not want to play it against him because he's good not because of any misbehavior, right?

429
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,746
Speaker 0: You don't play basketball against Michael Jordan.

430
00:26:57,207 --> 00:26:59,474
Speaker 1: Well, I do because that would be a fascinating you're not?

431
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:06,080
Speaker 1: it's like see part of it Is like like I want to lose to ridiculous people just because that's what hell of an experience.

432
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,525
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, so here's the problem.

433
00:27:07,565 --> 00:27:09,693
Speaker 0: right depending it depends a lot on the game right?

434
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:15,812
Speaker 0: if I play basketball against Michael Jordan It's not fun because the skill difference is so big.

435
00:27:16,213 --> 00:27:17,256
Speaker 0: even old Michael Jordan.

436
00:27:17,377 --> 00:27:21,854
Speaker 0: today Michael Jordan the skill Oh, yeah, still so big I would never touch the ball.

437
00:27:21,914 --> 00:27:23,360
Speaker 0: I would never do anything meaningful.

438
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,226
Speaker 0: I would net right and it would.

439
00:27:25,326 --> 00:27:26,790
Speaker 0: so it's like I'm not even playing basketball.

440
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:29,920
Speaker 0: I'm literally just standing there maybe running around ineffectively.

441
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:31,525
Speaker 0: I'm not even playing the game.

442
00:27:31,545 --> 00:27:31,766
Speaker 0: It's not.

443
00:27:31,826 --> 00:27:35,800
Speaker 0: even if I'm not upset by losing I don't get to do anything now.

444
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:38,032
Speaker 1: Yeah, now I want to play that game.

445
00:27:38,092 --> 00:27:48,880
Speaker 0: It's like for example, though I would love to say go in a car race again, you know, like if I could drive an f1 car and not die Against you know, even Lewis Hamilton, right?

446
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:58,150
Speaker 0: It'd be great because even though he's gonna lap me like ten times and I'm not maybe I'll stall and who knows what'll happen to Me I'm gonna hike still have the fun of driving the car.

447
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:01,360
Speaker 0: I can still enjoy the experience of playing, right?

448
00:28:01,441 --> 00:28:05,725
Speaker 0: So if you it depends on the game in cat in a game like FPS say quake.

449
00:28:06,286 --> 00:28:10,660
Speaker 0: right if you're up against someone really really really good, especially like quake three that open map.

450
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:16,920
Speaker 0: You know the one where it's just like you're about It's literally spawn railgun to the head spawn railgun to the heads.

451
00:28:18,341 --> 00:28:22,176
Speaker 0: Right, you won't even get to walk around or pick up items or even shoot a rocket.

452
00:28:22,216 --> 00:28:23,020
Speaker 0: so it won't be fun.

453
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:33,596
Speaker 0: But if the game is such where even against a really good player, you can actually still do stuff You just won't win that and maybe even kill him once then it's okay at least by me.

454
00:28:33,917 --> 00:28:35,466
Speaker 0: but against other people They just don't.

455
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:39,269
Speaker 0: they just can't deal with losing period Want a competitive game.

456
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,100
Speaker 1: it appeared to be the better players.

457
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:47,198
Speaker 1: They just want fun avoiding this guy because what the there was a secondary like that was that good.

458
00:28:47,218 --> 00:28:50,720
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, so I mean I used to play in clans like Ken.

459
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:58,415
Speaker 1: He was one of our snipers like when we'd like I'd do skirmishes with them or like I'd play Mega TF or weapons factory in weapons factory.

460
00:28:58,677 --> 00:28:59,320
Speaker 1: He was good.

461
00:28:59,421 --> 00:29:04,167
Speaker 1: So if you want you if he was up in the battlements like a do for bad That was just a no-man's land.

462
00:29:04,207 --> 00:29:04,629
Speaker 1: in between.

463
00:29:04,649 --> 00:29:07,600
Speaker 1: the two would be like the snipers dueling and no one could even go out there.

464
00:29:07,982 --> 00:29:11,140
Speaker 1: Everyone had to go alter your roots, but there was a secondary effect.

465
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:14,500
Speaker 1: It's even funnier because it could never find a match.

466
00:29:14,861 --> 00:29:18,516
Speaker 1: It would keep widening the net of who it would match this person up against.

467
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:21,980
Speaker 1: so eventually It would open it up to the lower skill players.

468
00:29:22,301 --> 00:29:26,079
Speaker 1: So he went whenever he did find a game it would only ever be against noobs.

469
00:29:26,902 --> 00:29:28,327
Speaker 1: So it made it even worse.

470
00:29:28,507 --> 00:29:39,160
Speaker 0: and he's just they and then those noobs block him and he fights even newbie or newbie or people And eventually he's just by himself playing against like literally someone who logged in and then died at the controls, right?

471
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:49,080
Speaker 0: so I think the solution one of the solutions to this that I advocate for that know that the game companies seem to hate is to literally Segregate the population right there.

472
00:29:49,181 --> 00:29:52,880
Speaker 0: So again segregating your player base into two, you know or more groups.

473
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:58,259
Speaker 0: Well, you can't it like in lizards games, especially overwatch more than anything have so many players.

474
00:29:58,399 --> 00:29:59,604
Speaker 0: Yes I think that you could.

475
00:29:59,644 --> 00:30:00,769
Speaker 0: they could afford to do it.

476
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:03,500
Speaker 0: You should have serious mode and not serious mode.

477
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,363
Speaker 1: So that is coming.

478
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:08,938
Speaker 1: that is actually one of the changes that is coming and in and serious mode should be completely different from.

479
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:14,444
Speaker 1: serious Mode has different rules and it like like they talked about that like regular mode Just the way the game is.

480
00:30:14,785 --> 00:30:15,388
Speaker 1: you'll often.

481
00:30:15,428 --> 00:30:18,078
Speaker 1: the games will often go into overtime if the teams are well matched.

482
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,980
Speaker 1: in Serious mode overtime is a lot more brutal and hopefully a lot more rare.

483
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:33,080
Speaker 0: I also you know, I think that Syria, you know If it what I've been thinking of for serious mode is it should be a lot more serious in terms of the money You bring this up every time.

484
00:30:33,721 --> 00:30:36,000
Speaker 0: Should it be free to be in serious mode?

485
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,149
Speaker 0: because if you're serious, you should be willing to pay money.

486
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,138
Speaker 1: and what if you're good, but just poor?

487
00:30:40,158 --> 00:30:48,039
Speaker 0: I Then if you you know, if you have a bad skills Then you can play in serious mode and you you know As long as you don't decide whether or not you have to pay.

488
00:30:48,602 --> 00:30:53,540
Speaker 1: Hmm, is it gonna be like a vote or whatever and he gets the reverse scholarship or with all that stuff?

489
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,720
Speaker 0: How does the NFL decide who to give fines to when they misbehave?

490
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,207
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they're serious.

491
00:30:58,227 --> 00:30:59,719
Speaker 1: be those people are being paid.

492
00:31:00,262 --> 00:31:04,979
Speaker 0: Right, if you're so good that you're in serious mode and you've done and you've misbehaved then fuck you.

493
00:31:05,544 --> 00:31:06,837
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think that's gonna be a problem.

494
00:31:06,858 --> 00:31:07,401
Speaker 1: serious You could.

495
00:31:07,441 --> 00:31:16,660
Speaker 0: you can choose just not to play in serious mode if you can't and I don't think you go into serious mode for And then as long as you don't misbehave you won't have to pay anything.

496
00:31:17,061 --> 00:31:22,420
Speaker 1: I don't think there is enough of a problem of serious mode in games like this to warrant financial penalties.

497
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:36,005
Speaker 0: I think there should be some real penalties not just like banning and kicking for people who misbehave in a game and then you could ensure that serious mode is Like this beautiful community of happiness because all the shitheads you're fucking kicked out All they do is all they see.

498
00:31:36,045 --> 00:31:37,631
Speaker 1: you're already doing a very good job.

499
00:31:37,671 --> 00:31:38,855
Speaker 1: Like they're bad people.

500
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:42,800
Speaker 0: Yeah permanently banned Yes, they're permanently banning them, which is fine.

501
00:31:43,061 --> 00:31:46,940
Speaker 0: But but what I would much rather put a bigger hurt on those people.

502
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,064
Speaker 1: Why does the goal?

503
00:31:48,346 --> 00:31:52,442
Speaker 1: I thought the goal of a justice system is one prevent harm To.

504
00:31:52,542 --> 00:31:57,320
Speaker 1: if harm happens or address it to the biggest extent possible punishment is not even a factor.

505
00:31:57,902 --> 00:31:59,307
Speaker 1: So why are you here?

506
00:31:59,548 --> 00:32:00,572
Speaker 1: So keen on punishment?

507
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:04,904
Speaker 1: shouldn't the only goal being to prevent harm You prevent a lot more?

508
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:10,777
Speaker 1: because oh, so you're saying that by punishing people by causing that kind of harm in a sanctioned way You're preventing more harm.

509
00:32:11,964 --> 00:32:16,500
Speaker 0: Threat of a fine versus the threat of a ban will dissuade people from doing it in.

510
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,543
Speaker 1: the Band is actually going.

511
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:25,120
Speaker 1: so the other day someone used a derogatory term in a match and I mess it up right away.

512
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:36,027
Speaker 1: It's like I'm gonna report you and he was like what far and I was like you said and you and the player like actually Was like oh and like apologize and then was like super nice the whole rest of the match I'd still report him.

513
00:32:36,712 --> 00:32:42,508
Speaker 1: I did anyway, but But they did apologize and it was like then they were nice the whole rest of the match like.

514
00:32:42,548 --> 00:32:47,380
Speaker 1: that literally happened and That was kind of notable like it stood out in my mind.

515
00:32:53,464 --> 00:33:04,612
Speaker 1: but anyway things of the day Is a cute little blog I found and one of the it's and there's an article here Japanese things in video games and it's basically all these.

516
00:33:04,893 --> 00:33:05,996
Speaker 0: you mean everything cuz.

517
00:33:06,057 --> 00:33:10,013
Speaker 0: video games are Japanese Yeah, but like is it everything in video games Japanese?

518
00:33:10,094 --> 00:33:13,252
Speaker 1: It's in the event There are often sprites.

519
00:33:13,273 --> 00:33:14,380
Speaker 0: I guess they didn't invent video games.

520
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:18,053
Speaker 0: We invented pong and stuff or particular ways of running real video game.

521
00:33:18,093 --> 00:33:28,092
Speaker 1: that like Japan like for example it points out that Japan in video games almost always depicts apples as Fuji apples was like right on top and yellow on the bottom and explains why.

522
00:33:28,113 --> 00:33:29,960
Speaker 1: that's just a way they happen to draw things.

523
00:33:30,384 --> 00:33:44,017
Speaker 1: Yeah, and apparently Most people in the US and much of the world have always thought that that was a pineapple in Pac-man, but it's actually a honeydew or just a melon.

524
00:33:44,037 --> 00:33:47,915
Speaker 1: because apparently Japan They just call all different melons melons and don't really specify the money.

525
00:33:47,955 --> 00:33:48,960
Speaker 1: melon from the other melons.

526
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,632
Speaker 0: I know honeydew doesn't taste like a cantaloupe.

527
00:33:50,652 --> 00:33:56,220
Speaker 1: It's a different melon Yeah, but melons just a generic term as far as I can tell versus a canary melon is way different.

528
00:33:56,381 --> 00:33:58,540
Speaker 1: Everyone always assumed that was a pineapple in Pac-man.

529
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,560
Speaker 1: Apparently it's actually a honeydew which they would call a melon and it just so happens the Japan.

530
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,500
Speaker 1: They always leave this t-shaped stem on it and that's taken out of the top.

531
00:34:07,621 --> 00:34:12,737
Speaker 1: Everyone thought the sprite was either a grenade or a pineapple But now it's a honeydew melon.

532
00:34:13,862 --> 00:34:19,159
Speaker 1: And my favorite line of this entire thing is peaches are always depicted in this implausible upside-down pose.

533
00:34:19,261 --> 00:34:20,366
Speaker 0: Is this all food related?

534
00:34:20,789 --> 00:34:21,713
Speaker 1: Uh, just the top.

535
00:34:21,754 --> 00:34:28,540
Speaker 1: Here's the whole section on vegetables Okay, and Western foods and the association between fried chicken and Christmas.

536
00:34:30,221 --> 00:34:31,827
Speaker 1: So this is just very interesting.

537
00:34:31,867 --> 00:34:42,759
Speaker 1: if you play a lot of like NES games, especially like those weird Platformers that like you'd see for rental, but like you'd never really played that much You'll see a lot of these as sprites and now you'll know what the hell they are.

538
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:46,020
Speaker 1: I would have never have guessed that this thing was a baby pacifier.

539
00:34:46,686 --> 00:34:51,389
Speaker 0: Okay Got a thing of the day I do so this dude I don't know how much time he spent on this.

540
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:52,820
Speaker 1: I mean this baby rattle looks like a push pop.

541
00:34:53,141 --> 00:34:55,533
Speaker 0: Okay, it seems like this dude spent a lot of time on this.

542
00:34:55,553 --> 00:34:57,000
Speaker 0: this video was released today.

543
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,246
Speaker 0: So this thing is brand new.

544
00:34:58,689 --> 00:35:00,840
Speaker 0: He made a doom mod a wad file.

545
00:35:01,021 --> 00:35:06,231
Speaker 0: That is a doom mod and it is a very small doom map But a very elaborate one.

546
00:35:06,251 --> 00:35:08,983
Speaker 0: that is Seinfeld's apartment.

547
00:35:09,644 --> 00:35:10,667
Speaker 1: Scott showed this to me.

548
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:15,040
Speaker 0: It's it's real good and you don't need to actually download the wad and load it up.

549
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:22,700
Speaker 0: You can just watch the YouTube video, but the one of the best YouTube comments says what's the deal with double-barreled shotguns?

550
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:29,360
Speaker 0: And the best comment in reply to that is why not have three barrels to which I say why not?

551
00:35:31,484 --> 00:35:34,676
Speaker 0: That would be great and totally appropriate for a game like doom.

552
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:35,760
Speaker 1: sometimes I love the internet.

553
00:35:37,742 --> 00:35:41,440
Speaker 1: In the meta moment the book club book a long time ago was the wheel of time.

554
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:52,629
Speaker 1: I'm literally in the last like hundred pages of the last book of the wheel of time But for the book club, you only had to read the first book of the 14 of the wheel of time Not counting new spring, which is the 15th.

555
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:55,700
Speaker 0: Wait, did we do the episode on wheel of time long time ago?

556
00:35:55,981 --> 00:35:57,146
Speaker 0: I was like, yeah, we did already.

557
00:35:57,207 --> 00:35:57,769
Speaker 0: Yeah, we did.

558
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:03,653
Speaker 1: Okay, but the next book club book Which will start probably right after Connecticut is Oryx and Crick by Margaret Atwood.

559
00:36:04,697 --> 00:36:05,379
Speaker 1: I think that'll be fun.

560
00:36:06,243 --> 00:36:07,300
Speaker 1: Otherwise, we're gonna be a Connecticut.

561
00:36:08,341 --> 00:36:11,349
Speaker 0: When is Connecticut the week after the fourth of July?

562
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:17,345
Speaker 1: Yeah, which is the July 8th 9th and 10th in Hartford Connecticut like three weeks for now.

563
00:36:17,505 --> 00:36:18,308
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

564
00:36:18,889 --> 00:36:20,254
Speaker 1: We were on the panels department.

565
00:36:20,675 --> 00:36:22,400
Speaker 1: The panel schedule is mostly online.

566
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,752
Speaker 1: I got a little bit of work to do to like get everything going.

567
00:36:24,812 --> 00:36:26,280
Speaker 1: but Connecticut's the con.

568
00:36:26,623 --> 00:36:32,015
Speaker 1: But I will warn you our gig nights listeners There's some things that have changed that while the website is being very clear about this.

569
00:36:32,036 --> 00:36:42,660
Speaker 1: I am 100% sure that at least 200 people who show up to Connecticut will not know that this change has occurred.

570
00:36:43,328 --> 00:36:52,180
Speaker 1: the con the Convention Center closes at 9 instead of midnight and then all the 9 p.m To midnight content and the overnight content is in the Marriott Hotel connected.

571
00:36:53,024 --> 00:37:00,942
Speaker 1: I think a lot of people do not know that and it'll be very interesting The people who are surprised when we kick them out of convention center at 855.

572
00:37:00,942 --> 00:37:01,988
Speaker 1: But Connecticut is always fun.

573
00:37:02,008 --> 00:37:04,400
Speaker 1: I would not say fly to Connecticut.

574
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,600
Speaker 1: I'm not say travel multiple days.

575
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:13,160
Speaker 0: You can get to Connecticut by use of a car or walking or bicycling.

576
00:37:13,281 --> 00:37:16,305
Speaker 1: Yeah, even a train Within the same day.

577
00:37:16,385 --> 00:37:17,309
Speaker 0: It's worth going to.

578
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:23,698
Speaker 0: I know like if you live in like New York City Is it really worth attending Connecticut by Amtrak as an attendee?

579
00:37:23,718 --> 00:37:24,883
Speaker 0: Yes I don't know.

580
00:37:24,984 --> 00:37:28,980
Speaker 1: I would still go to Connecticut because one the price of the Connecticut ticket is so high.

581
00:37:29,162 --> 00:37:30,138
Speaker 1: Oh, well, I would get in for free.

582
00:37:31,162 --> 00:37:33,232
Speaker 1: Plus how higher all we don't pay for conventions.

583
00:37:33,272 --> 00:37:35,040
Speaker 1: I don't think you realize how expensive conventions.

584
00:37:35,121 --> 00:37:39,482
Speaker 0: I think only tax is more expensive than I mean Anime.

585
00:37:39,502 --> 00:37:42,093
Speaker 0: Boston is cheaper than Connecticut anime expos not cheap.

586
00:37:42,133 --> 00:37:53,336
Speaker 1: If you want to go to any you don't want to go to anime But I would go to Connecticut because I'll put it this way One it's the only con we can perform at that isn't gaming and anime.

587
00:37:53,356 --> 00:37:54,400
Speaker 0: That's not a reason to attend it.

588
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,544
Speaker 0: What's the reason to attend it?

589
00:37:55,604 --> 00:38:00,320
Speaker 1: by buying a ticket other than Pax West Pax East Pax South and Pax Australia and magfest?

590
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,446
Speaker 1: It's the best tabletop convention in America.

591
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,833
Speaker 0: Sure in terms of just that's right.

592
00:38:04,853 --> 00:38:06,920
Speaker 0: Thank you Jen Khan and fuck you origins.

593
00:38:08,922 --> 00:38:17,680
Speaker 1: Also, it actually has really good panels and like the dealers room They're like all that stuff has all the accoutrement of a convention and I just found kind of go to.

594
00:38:18,482 --> 00:38:20,800
Speaker 1: I might even enjoy it more if I wasn't running everything.

595
00:38:22,282 --> 00:38:26,406
Speaker 1: so we'll be there doing some panels - but Yeah, well, we'll see you there.

596
00:38:26,808 --> 00:38:31,242
Speaker 1: Do not expect to hang out with us if you're there because we'll be busy Otherwise.

597
00:38:31,322 --> 00:38:33,551
Speaker 1: Pax Prime is coming up and Pax dev.

598
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,680
Speaker 1: We will debt will definitely be a Pax Prime.

599
00:38:36,303 --> 00:38:38,654
Speaker 1: I assume and hopefully we'll be doing a panel or two at Pax Prime.

600
00:38:39,136 --> 00:38:39,980
Speaker 1: I'll be a Pax dev.

601
00:38:40,442 --> 00:38:41,669
Speaker 1: Maybe Scott will be a Pax day.

602
00:38:41,709 --> 00:38:45,084
Speaker 1: We haven't decided yet and otherwise See you on the internet.

603
00:38:45,506 --> 00:38:46,469
Speaker 1: check out our YouTube videos.

604
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:55,760
Speaker 1: in particular check out our series on me and Scott playing Civ 5 two-player games because two-player Civ 5 is weird and only military matters.

605
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:58,851
Speaker 1: Uh, I did not defeat you militarily in the last game.

606
00:38:58,892 --> 00:39:01,100
Speaker 1: I didn't do shit militarily you effectively.

607
00:39:01,544 --> 00:39:03,299
Speaker 1: Well, no, I just built a bunch of cities.

608
00:39:04,602 --> 00:39:08,922
Speaker 0: I did know if you didn't build any military then I could have caravanned all day I.

609
00:39:08,943 --> 00:39:13,680
Speaker 1: yeah Scott my huge military was like one unit that walked over and blocked like your transport.

610
00:39:13,922 --> 00:39:16,740
Speaker 0: Right, so I didn't have enough military to push your military out of the way.

611
00:39:16,942 --> 00:39:18,520
Speaker 1: You should have had a stronger economy.

612
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:21,511
Speaker 0: So where that would but that was my economy was those caravans.

613
00:39:21,531 --> 00:39:23,760
Speaker 1: don't make your economy something so dependent on the military.

614
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,283
Speaker 0: I don't know how.

615
00:39:24,303 --> 00:39:24,604
Speaker 0: well that's.

616
00:39:24,624 --> 00:39:25,247
Speaker 0: the thing is how do you?

617
00:39:25,267 --> 00:39:29,082
Speaker 0: there's no way to make an economy and Civ that isn't based on Caravans.

618
00:39:29,103 --> 00:39:30,047
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are ways.

619
00:39:30,228 --> 00:39:32,840
Speaker 0: How do you make a lot of money without caravans or cargo ships?

620
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:38,331
Speaker 1: So I could so in the videos cuz I only put the videos up like once we finish a game I started putting the videos together.

621
00:39:38,351 --> 00:39:45,320
Speaker 1: in the next one You'll see a trick that I pulled where I do build orders and do some bullshit and you're gonna be real mad at what I did.

622
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,827
Speaker 0: How do you make money without caravans a cargo ship?

623
00:39:47,847 --> 00:39:48,709
Speaker 1: There's a few ways.

624
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:54,617
Speaker 1: one way that's real interesting Scott, especially in a game like this lose the race to build a wonder.

625
00:39:54,637 --> 00:40:01,940
Speaker 1: if You are building a wonder and someone beats you to it all the hammers you put into that turn into cash.

626
00:40:02,141 --> 00:40:02,664
Speaker 0: I didn't know that.

627
00:40:02,704 --> 00:40:04,775
Speaker 0: I thought you just lose everything up every Civ.

628
00:40:04,956 --> 00:40:05,780
Speaker 1: It's turned into cash.

629
00:40:06,602 --> 00:40:10,033
Speaker 1: It turned into cash in Civ 2. you like it was fine.

630
00:40:10,053 --> 00:40:11,036
Speaker 1: I would.

631
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:11,597
Speaker 1: very often.

632
00:40:11,637 --> 00:40:16,575
Speaker 1: in fact in Civ 5 I have often gone for wonders because I was so desperate for cash that either.

633
00:40:16,595 --> 00:40:21,357
Speaker 0: Hey, I got a wonder I didn't expect but you know in no Civ ever has there been like a pop-up.

634
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:25,311
Speaker 0: when that happens It says you get you lost X hammers and gained X gold.

635
00:40:25,351 --> 00:40:26,074
Speaker 0: So I never knew that.

636
00:40:26,776 --> 00:40:27,720
Speaker 0: I never knew that until just now.

637
00:40:28,101 --> 00:40:30,030
Speaker 1: Well, you didn't know about the demographics tab.

638
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:38,165
Speaker 0: until you get in the one game that I put on YouTube All I do is I do I move my units and I click next turn and if a city needs to build something I choose it and I click next turn.

639
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:40,415
Speaker 1: I move like individual workers.

640
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:41,540
Speaker 0: I don't pay attention.

641
00:40:41,681 --> 00:40:43,832
Speaker 0: I never I never in my whole life actually paid attention.

642
00:40:43,852 --> 00:40:49,920
Speaker 0: like in Civ 2 in the back in the day I'd open up the city window and they've all these fucking numbers and pictures of barrels of grain and shit.

643
00:40:50,122 --> 00:40:51,656
Speaker 0: I just ignored all that, huh?

644
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,695
Speaker 1: That explains how things are going in the current game.

645
00:40:54,735 --> 00:40:56,870
Speaker 1: then Good luck.

646
00:40:56,891 --> 00:40:57,339
Speaker 1: Have fun.

647
00:40:58,626 --> 00:41:05,480
Speaker 1: So six days ago Scott sent me a link to this reddit thread and It's a pretty amazing thread.

648
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,886
Speaker 1: like I spent a while like.

649
00:41:06,946 --> 00:41:15,820
Speaker 1: I've read a bunch of this thread and it was enjoyable and The title of it is what is the strangest or most unusual strategy in a game?

650
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:20,357
Speaker 1: you've seen that should never worked but worked but wound up actually working.

651
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:40,200
Speaker 1: and We were thinking about this because there's you know We talked a lot about up like we just did in the opening and the overwatch news how a lot of people play games But kind of like how a lot of people watch sports But don't know like they don't follow sports that deeply or they have a hobby But they're kind of idly into it like people who say they're into movies or TV, but they don't really know much about them.

652
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,472
Speaker 1: They kind of consume them and watch them, but that's about it.

653
00:41:43,076 --> 00:41:43,860
Speaker 1: games are the same way.

654
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,720
Speaker 1: They're like any other hobby and it was interesting to see all these people right?

655
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:54,260
Speaker 0: Think about how many people watch Star Wars most people who live in civilized society that have access to movies.

656
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,020
Speaker 0: How many people know?

657
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:58,158
Speaker 0: Who Mon Mothma is?

658
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,046
Speaker 0: Okay, so how many people play board games?

659
00:42:01,307 --> 00:42:02,069
Speaker 0: tons of people.

660
00:42:02,109 --> 00:42:03,233
Speaker 0: board games are getting still.

661
00:42:03,393 --> 00:42:05,420
Speaker 0: even we've been playing them since like our lives.

662
00:42:05,521 --> 00:42:06,933
Speaker 0: But you know euro types.

663
00:42:06,953 --> 00:42:11,412
Speaker 0: since like 2000 It's only been getting more popular over the past 16 plus years.

664
00:42:11,774 --> 00:42:13,620
Speaker 0: right and still increasing in popularity.

665
00:42:13,962 --> 00:42:17,640
Speaker 0: But how many of those board game people right really?

666
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,255
Speaker 0: Understand when you should craft and when you should captain in Puerto Rico and why?

667
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:23,465
Speaker 0: no it's really the same The same percentages.

668
00:42:23,485 --> 00:42:24,008
Speaker 0: people know who.

669
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:27,263
Speaker 0: you know John Dodonah is yeah I guess.

670
00:42:27,303 --> 00:42:35,312
Speaker 1: what's different about this though like what makes it kind of really interesting to me and again everything That's about to follow is all in good fun because reality is people know

671
00:42:35,392 --> 00:42:40,478
Speaker 0: rims basically just gonna insult all those people who don't know Who Mon Mothma is or what a both end looks like?

672
00:42:42,041 --> 00:42:45,715
Speaker 0: Saying that he's not insulting that like someone who says this isn't racist, but I'm not.

673
00:42:45,755 --> 00:42:46,900
Speaker 0: I'm not insulting you.

674
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,420
Speaker 1: But but the thing is with games.

675
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:57,134
Speaker 1: What's very interesting is that I think they're all stupid games I only half agree are a thing you play You're trying to win.

676
00:42:57,154 --> 00:42:59,800
Speaker 1: you'd assume You're at least trying to if there is a win or at least yeah.

677
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:03,840
Speaker 1: Or you think you're trying to win or you're playing patty cake and you're just trying to complete patty cake successfully.

678
00:43:04,445 --> 00:43:05,050
Speaker 1: Or maybe you're not me.

679
00:43:05,071 --> 00:43:05,958
Speaker 1: you're trolling in patty cake.

680
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,489
Speaker 0: Maybe it's mario paint.

681
00:43:07,912 --> 00:43:09,040
Speaker 1: it is very interesting to me.

682
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:15,240
Speaker 1: How many people will say that board gaming is a significant hobby for them and play board games a lot?

683
00:43:15,904 --> 00:43:18,802
Speaker 1: Like to the point that it is the primary Identify.

684
00:43:19,123 --> 00:43:25,980
Speaker 1: it is the primary social currency they bandy about and yet they literally never get better at games.

685
00:43:26,582 --> 00:43:30,297
Speaker 0: They don't have an analytical mindset and they don't try.

686
00:43:30,337 --> 00:43:30,859
Speaker 0: they don't you know.

687
00:43:31,281 --> 00:43:34,020
Speaker 0: They're focused more on the drinking than the act than the gaming.

688
00:43:34,201 --> 00:43:36,471
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know they like the gaming, but they don't like.

689
00:43:36,511 --> 00:43:36,973
Speaker 0: you know they.

690
00:43:37,274 --> 00:43:38,560
Speaker 0: they don't like losing right.

691
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:41,940
Speaker 0: They just like you know fooling around and moving pieces around.

692
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:45,660
Speaker 0: They don't you know think about winning and care and even if they did care about winning.

693
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:48,797
Speaker 0: They can't because they don't think the right way.

694
00:43:48,817 --> 00:43:52,077
Speaker 1: another thing I have noticed this kind of a side thing is there's a lot of people out there who?

695
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:59,100
Speaker 1: Mostly play games with one group of people and that seems to be the source of most of the posts in this reddit.

696
00:43:59,321 --> 00:44:04,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, because it's basically like me and see I think most board game people are exactly that way.

697
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,120
Speaker 0: They have one group especially if you're in the suburbs.

698
00:44:06,369 --> 00:44:09,228
Speaker 0: Yeah They have their group of players And that's the only people they ever play with.

699
00:44:09,308 --> 00:44:22,499
Speaker 1: ever so even if you're all smart and like super trying to win And like even trying to like analyze the games if your group sort of falls into this rhythm It's very likely that there will be a strategy that no one in your group happened to think of.

700
00:44:23,224 --> 00:44:25,319
Speaker 1: That's just how it goes in a small community like that.

701
00:44:25,641 --> 00:44:28,452
Speaker 0: You know the legend even if you're even if you're a really amazing player.

702
00:44:28,472 --> 00:44:31,402
Speaker 0: right you you need You know.

703
00:44:31,422 --> 00:44:33,749
Speaker 0: you need someone to play against to push you.

704
00:44:33,769 --> 00:44:37,700
Speaker 0: you know to get you know to find the optimal path.

705
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:42,074
Speaker 0: Otherwise you'll find some path that like you know is really strong against the people.

706
00:44:42,114 --> 00:44:42,575
Speaker 0: you play again.

707
00:44:42,675 --> 00:44:44,140
Speaker 1: local maxima perhaps right?

708
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,935
Speaker 0: But if you play that way against people.

709
00:44:46,996 --> 00:44:51,880
Speaker 0: actually any good You'll still get hosed But you would never find the way to play against those people and win until you play again.

710
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:55,380
Speaker 1: What was the stories of the go masters going out to the right way province?

711
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,660
Speaker 0: There was some go master who lived in the woods and no one ever beat him.

712
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,280
Speaker 0: And then you know the Shogun was like oh my god.

713
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:05,568
Speaker 0: I heard legends of this amazing go master Undefeated from the woods invite him to the capital.

714
00:45:05,588 --> 00:45:11,680
Speaker 0: so he comes to the capital and he just gets blitzed by all the actual go Masters who actually play against each other in the capital.

715
00:45:12,486 --> 00:45:14,560
Speaker 1: So what I kind of want to do is this certain experiment.

716
00:45:14,661 --> 00:45:16,800
Speaker 0: Here's a bunch of stories from go masters in the woods.

717
00:45:16,861 --> 00:45:23,616
Speaker 1: Yeah The top comment the 400 point most voted up thing is all sheep plus sheep poor.

718
00:45:23,636 --> 00:45:25,741
Speaker 0: so first of all that's not strange or unusual At all.

719
00:45:25,882 --> 00:45:29,294
Speaker 1: that's like if some way if the other players don't stop you.

720
00:45:29,836 --> 00:45:31,622
Speaker 1: Yeah like duh Right

721
00:45:32,023 --> 00:45:46,515
Speaker 0: also if so in settlers if there's a bunch of sheep tiles near the sheep port or a bunch of brick tiles near the Brick port so that you don't to build a lot of roads because if you have sheep you're not getting a lot of roads Right now you that you can actually set that up like especially if you can put one of yours.

722
00:45:46,575 --> 00:45:49,708
Speaker 0: if you don't go to place The first settlement I like the six and the eight.

723
00:45:50,149 --> 00:46:00,181
Speaker 0: if there's like a five or a ten or something reasonably Okay next to it that you can put your starting settlement on the sheep port and a sheep and put your other one on a Like.

724
00:46:00,201 --> 00:46:16,311
Speaker 0: you go forth in placement, and you can get cheap sheep, then yeah, okay sure other people are gonna Get resources more often, but you only need to get two sheep to get one of anything Automatically so you can basically catch up to them even though you have lower

725
00:46:16,572 --> 00:46:18,297
Speaker 1: odds and frankly the people who and

726
00:46:18,337 --> 00:46:25,140
Speaker 0: mathematically it could be About equal and then of course luck if swings your way if they're not rolling a lot of sixes and eighths which can happen.

727
00:46:25,281 --> 00:46:27,049
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can win really easily.

728
00:46:27,069 --> 00:46:29,340
Speaker 0: It's like just a couple rolls where you get two sheep.

729
00:46:29,781 --> 00:46:30,464
Speaker 0: It's just like whoo.

730
00:46:31,407 --> 00:46:43,390
Speaker 1: and what's even more interesting is if you don't like if you let this happen Like the kind of person who would let someone get a sheep port and a bunch of easy access to sheep Those are the kinds of people who are gonna lose to that person.

731
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:52,160
Speaker 0: right if I see if I see rim starting settlements are On my grain grain grain, and I see him put her his first road aiming towards the grain port.

732
00:46:52,861 --> 00:46:59,806
Speaker 0: I'm going to put on the grain port to prevent him from putting a settlement on the grain Settlers game is determined in.

733
00:46:59,846 --> 00:47:04,260
Speaker 0: but say someone who is not really good at settlers isn't going to see that a settlers.

734
00:47:04,441 --> 00:47:06,228
Speaker 1: I can see it from the first road.

735
00:47:06,308 --> 00:47:06,991
Speaker 1: in this order.

736
00:47:07,292 --> 00:47:07,433
Speaker 1: one.

737
00:47:07,453 --> 00:47:08,979
Speaker 1: Do you know how the game works?

738
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:15,000
Speaker 1: You know yes, or no, and if that's tied go down to the next tier which is in fact I didn't even need to put a sediment.

739
00:47:15,081 --> 00:47:17,019
Speaker 0: I just need to put my longest road to black.

740
00:47:17,781 --> 00:47:19,607
Speaker 1: Number two now how the dice shake out.

741
00:47:19,868 --> 00:47:22,076
Speaker 1: number three who place their settlements where?

742
00:47:22,096 --> 00:47:26,770
Speaker 1: in the very beginning of the game The only way you will ever see sheep port plus sheep.

743
00:47:27,171 --> 00:47:37,566
Speaker 1: and actually of all the ports she poured plus sheep is by the best one Because then you're probably doing a sheep grain strategy if we're gonna do the tripods and go for you need rock to get stiffy Cards also right.

744
00:47:37,586 --> 00:47:48,666
Speaker 0: yeah, you can always get some rock with your sheep port But I feel like the brick wood port is actually the best because you can use roads from all you start on brick And woods that have good odds.

745
00:47:48,927 --> 00:47:50,091
Speaker 0: you get a lot of bricks and woods.

746
00:47:50,112 --> 00:47:56,928
Speaker 0: you can road your way over to a brick or a Wood port and put us put a settlement on it then Use that.

747
00:47:57,090 --> 00:48:02,493
Speaker 0: you keep getting bricks and woods But through the rest of the game without having to settle on the rocks grains and sheeps.

748
00:48:02,734 --> 00:48:04,360
Speaker 0: you can get them using the port.

749
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:08,533
Speaker 0: so In the early game you get the roads And then you can upgrade to the cities and then the game is probably over by then.

750
00:48:08,714 --> 00:48:14,518
Speaker 1: the only way you'll ever see this happen In a game of skilled players is if the person who does it had to go forth.

751
00:48:15,303 --> 00:48:15,545
Speaker 0: Sure.

752
00:48:15,706 --> 00:48:16,210
Speaker 0: yeah cuz.

753
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:24,020
Speaker 0: then you can guarantee Because I mean if you're not gonna get the good placement of going first or second on the high odds Spots of where the sixes and eights are you make a perfect?

754
00:48:25,124 --> 00:48:28,660
Speaker 0: You're gonna need to use a port in order to catch up with your bad odds spots.

755
00:48:29,686 --> 00:48:32,365
Speaker 1: so Here's what's real interesting.

756
00:48:32,405 --> 00:48:32,767
Speaker 1: Well.

757
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:34,352
Speaker 1: Here's a comment on that one.

758
00:48:34,372 --> 00:48:35,175
Speaker 1: This is ready.

759
00:48:35,215 --> 00:48:35,898
Speaker 1: my first game.

760
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:36,540
Speaker 1: I ruled sheep.

761
00:48:36,841 --> 00:48:40,940
Speaker 1: I started naming them and eventually played my monopoly dev card just to get more sheep in my sheep army.

762
00:48:41,863 --> 00:48:45,346
Speaker 1: I didn't win the game you don't say But I felt like a winner.

763
00:48:45,406 --> 00:48:49,525
Speaker 0: you're supposed to trade away all your sheep and then play your monopoly sheep card And then spend them all.

764
00:48:49,565 --> 00:48:50,369
Speaker 1: well, so someone else.

765
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:52,640
Speaker 1: Here's a more fun way to use your monopoly card.

766
00:48:52,741 --> 00:48:55,780
Speaker 1: It'll make you end up with just as many friends as the game of Monopoly.

767
00:48:56,841 --> 00:48:59,099
Speaker 0: It's always like yeah That's baby's first settlers.

768
00:48:59,341 --> 00:49:06,899
Speaker 1: But to look at these these kinds of discussions because it's almost always People who like came up with a clever idea that they don't think anyone else has really come up with like it's.

769
00:49:06,919 --> 00:49:09,079
Speaker 0: like dude I've seen that it's 16 years old that move.

770
00:49:09,925 --> 00:49:25,254
Speaker 1: So Trade all the others and often the strategies are bad, too Like that monopoly thing that only works if it's kind of a noob game anyway, I guess Yeah, I mean if I see rim is like hey anyone want sheep.

771
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:26,640
Speaker 0: He starts trading sheep away.

772
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,668
Speaker 1: I'm like Scott's like rim never trades.

773
00:49:28,868 --> 00:49:29,531
Speaker 0: Yeah, well also.

774
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:30,775
Speaker 0: I'm like no rim.

775
00:49:30,816 --> 00:49:33,905
Speaker 0: I don't want your fucking she Give me them for free.

776
00:49:33,965 --> 00:49:35,491
Speaker 0: Maybe that's about it.

777
00:49:35,892 --> 00:49:40,090
Speaker 0: I see you trading away a big mountain of sheep But you just take your turn and we'll roll a seven.

778
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:41,276
Speaker 0: you got that fist full of sheep there.

779
00:49:41,336 --> 00:49:46,724
Speaker 0: throw some of them out to the robber Pull this off once.

780
00:49:47,266 --> 00:49:49,092
Speaker 1: yeah a lot of people are obsessed with the sheep thing.

781
00:49:49,995 --> 00:49:57,800
Speaker 1: mmm whatever It's interesting to watching people explain like the situation they've run into now.

782
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:02,600
Speaker 1: There's all these people talking about like fours and fives never get rolled and like nines never get rolled.

783
00:50:02,721 --> 00:50:03,444
Speaker 0: What are you talking about?

784
00:50:03,484 --> 00:50:04,488
Speaker 0: It's based on odds.

785
00:50:04,528 --> 00:50:07,120
Speaker 0: There's dots on the numbers that tell you how much they get rolled.

786
00:50:08,702 --> 00:50:10,009
Speaker 1: There's general disdain for Catan.

787
00:50:10,029 --> 00:50:12,060
Speaker 1: a lot of people myself included feel there's too much like involved.

788
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:16,676
Speaker 1: I think there is exacerbated by many folk my family that think it's 100% strategy.

789
00:50:18,662 --> 00:50:19,747
Speaker 0: It's more strategy than games.

790
00:50:19,787 --> 00:50:20,892
Speaker 0: They're used to yeah.

791
00:50:21,676 --> 00:50:22,440
Speaker 1: Oh, here's a good one.

792
00:50:22,721 --> 00:50:25,414
Speaker 1: We have a friend who doesn't look at her cards and coo.

793
00:50:25,696 --> 00:50:26,359
Speaker 1: does that count?

794
00:50:27,403 --> 00:50:31,180
Speaker 1: She's had enough success To have fun and use it regularly.

795
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:43,970
Speaker 1: It's a dumb game first of all but there's all these people who seemed like a really really trying to explain Whether or not this is a good or bad strategy and a lot of them seem really It doesn't even matter really.

796
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:55,860
Speaker 0: and coo if you look at your cards or not Yeah, well you can do the same thing and you just use whichever power is most advantageous Yeah, and in fact against most people the intimidation of not ever having looked at your own cards is enough to scare them.

797
00:50:56,201 --> 00:50:58,830
Speaker 1: Oh, it makes it harder to read whether you're bluffing or not.

798
00:50:58,910 --> 00:50:59,994
Speaker 1: bluffing doesn't exist.

799
00:51:00,376 --> 00:51:01,219
Speaker 1: Yeah game like this.

800
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:04,833
Speaker 0: Well, I mean you know there are people who try to like actually read.

801
00:51:04,873 --> 00:51:06,620
Speaker 0: other people like look at their eyes and whatever.

802
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:11,779
Speaker 0: But if you didn't look at your own cards, yeah, you don't know if you're but you just do whatever ability you want to you.

803
00:51:12,181 --> 00:51:15,673
Speaker 1: Whoa, here's someone who sees through the gnosis.

804
00:51:15,733 --> 00:51:16,777
Speaker 1: This is a this is great.

805
00:51:17,198 --> 00:51:21,009
Speaker 1: It becomes Impossible to know if you're bluffing or not because you're not bluffing.

806
00:51:21,069 --> 00:51:22,112
Speaker 1: now you're gambling.

807
00:51:22,554 --> 00:51:24,440
Speaker 1: it changes the game to a game of probability.

808
00:51:24,823 --> 00:51:26,720
Speaker 1: But since it's usually only for one player blah blah blah.

809
00:51:28,501 --> 00:51:32,255
Speaker 1: It would utterly lose the nature of coo if the whole whole table played that way.

810
00:51:32,315 --> 00:51:32,877
Speaker 1: I think yep.

811
00:51:32,897 --> 00:51:35,046
Speaker 1: You're right, dude All the all games.

812
00:51:35,086 --> 00:51:36,172
Speaker 1: that's why we don't play settlers.

813
00:51:36,212 --> 00:51:37,016
Speaker 1: that game breaks down.

814
00:51:37,056 --> 00:51:37,739
Speaker 0: we don't play coo.

815
00:51:38,041 --> 00:51:39,680
Speaker 1: That's why you don't play citadels played.

816
00:51:40,161 --> 00:51:43,331
Speaker 0: So once I was done citadels became a game of literally.

817
00:51:43,451 --> 00:51:47,507
Speaker 1: everyone shuffles the cards and plays the round randomly every turn Not every turn.

818
00:51:47,548 --> 00:51:53,794
Speaker 1: but you know, I'd always make it look like I was yeah They well what I would do is I would usually I would narrow it down to two.

819
00:51:53,855 --> 00:51:54,999
Speaker 1: that would be advantageous to me.

820
00:51:55,281 --> 00:52:00,383
Speaker 0: Yeah, because there is some that you pick and it's like yeah if I pick this one, it's really just yeah Useless.

821
00:52:00,403 --> 00:52:04,340
Speaker 1: like if I want to pick the bishop, I'd shuffle the bishop and some random card.

822
00:52:04,882 --> 00:52:11,046
Speaker 0: So I got a 50/50 shot like if I have a whole bunch of red cards, you know, and I picked the merchant It's like it's not helping me.

823
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:11,808
Speaker 0: I you know, I need.

824
00:52:11,909 --> 00:52:15,159
Speaker 0: I need to pick the warlord or like the assassin or the thief or something.

825
00:52:17,962 --> 00:52:22,478
Speaker 1: Lot of people talk about coup diplomacy where my friend Kyle didn't ever say a word.

826
00:52:23,201 --> 00:52:25,912
Speaker 1: We thought he was just being silly bringing Hubert a serious game.

827
00:52:25,953 --> 00:52:26,997
Speaker 1: It didn't think of his movements.

828
00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:31,779
Speaker 1: later He controlled most of Russia Turkey in the Balkans to retrieve him as a threat and we lost.

829
00:52:32,462 --> 00:52:37,020
Speaker 0: I mean you just couldn't you see after like the first turns orders that he took territory from you?

830
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:38,824
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know.

831
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:50,019
Speaker 1: I mean the problem with that game is that to Li with someone, you know Diplomacy is actually very difficult to parse the interactions Unless you've played it a lot and even then like it takes a while to chart it out.

832
00:52:50,322 --> 00:52:52,159
Speaker 1: So planning the interaction is very difficult.

833
00:52:52,521 --> 00:53:03,540
Speaker 1: So I suspect among most people who played diplomacy unless they play it like seriously and regularly Not coordinating with other people and only relying on yourself would probably do you really well for a really long time?

834
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,687
Speaker 0: I mean at least not after the first turn.

835
00:53:05,727 --> 00:53:10,750
Speaker 0: after the second turn you see that this person who hasn't said anything has Only gained territory.

836
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,519
Speaker 0: I would unite against them.

837
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,628
Speaker 1: Well, what you got to do?

838
00:53:14,668 --> 00:53:17,800
Speaker 1: some bullshit diplomacy with people that I had a non cooperative game.

839
00:53:17,921 --> 00:53:20,319
Speaker 0: I diplomacy with the people who were all you know.

840
00:53:21,002 --> 00:53:25,280
Speaker 0: Obviously he lost that territory by getting that territory by taking it from someone right?

841
00:53:25,681 --> 00:53:28,673
Speaker 0: So and hopefully it wasn't me, but if it was me, I would be.

842
00:53:28,694 --> 00:53:30,300
Speaker 0: you know, I'm the person next to him, right?

843
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,900
Speaker 0: So I picked the other person that lost territory to him.

844
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:35,253
Speaker 0: I was like look this guy took land from both of us.

845
00:53:35,695 --> 00:53:37,984
Speaker 0: in the last two turns You and me were teaming up.

846
00:53:38,024 --> 00:53:45,852
Speaker 0: take him out and back you not talking person either to start talking or else we're coming for you Right, and then we go to a room with the other person.

847
00:53:45,892 --> 00:53:49,293
Speaker 1: we make a plan to get him and we get him But then I if I was in the plan to get him.

848
00:53:49,313 --> 00:53:50,119
Speaker 1: I just betray you.

849
00:53:50,622 --> 00:53:51,867
Speaker 0: Why now that you're gonna just get it?

850
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:54,619
Speaker 0: you can just get killed in the back by the guy who's better than you.

851
00:53:54,901 --> 00:53:59,440
Speaker 1: Whoo, I had a friend who won a game of small world underground without declining his empire ever.

852
00:54:00,325 --> 00:54:00,667
Speaker 0: He didn't.

853
00:54:00,707 --> 00:54:01,532
Speaker 0: we must have had it.

854
00:54:01,693 --> 00:54:02,800
Speaker 0: Oh, he destroyed.

855
00:54:03,922 --> 00:54:06,029
Speaker 0: Well, I that must have been a an amazing Empire.

856
00:54:06,049 --> 00:54:09,299
Speaker 0: Yep be you didn't come into the board on to it.

857
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:10,723
Speaker 1: Yeah, no one attacked him.

858
00:54:10,763 --> 00:54:16,640
Speaker 1: more importantly small world has a problem like Vinci was did he say which what match what?

859
00:54:17,241 --> 00:54:17,864
Speaker 0: Empire was.

860
00:54:18,326 --> 00:54:19,512
Speaker 1: let's see iron dwarves.

861
00:54:20,075 --> 00:54:20,980
Speaker 0: What do iron dwarves?

862
00:54:22,042 --> 00:54:27,664
Speaker 1: The underground version of small world immortal iron dwarves Mortally, oh another person.

863
00:54:27,684 --> 00:54:30,010
Speaker 1: I've seen immortal iron dwarves run an entire game.

864
00:54:31,441 --> 00:54:32,811
Speaker 0: Do they have like super defense?

865
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:33,900
Speaker 0: You can't take them out easily.

866
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:34,523
Speaker 0: Is that what it is?

867
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:34,724
Speaker 0: You can.

868
00:54:34,744 --> 00:54:37,660
Speaker 1: just the best way to counter iron dwarves is too kind.

869
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:38,744
Speaker 1: I think he's typing wrong.

870
00:54:38,784 --> 00:54:41,453
Speaker 1: kill off the dwarves set by the tip Wyatt.

871
00:54:41,915 --> 00:54:46,680
Speaker 0: I can't parse with this person typed Yeah, I mean if they can't beat a guy who hasn't declined to Empire.

872
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:55,300
Speaker 0: but yeah, it's in Vinci small world if you can defend your empire and Because when you decline it you basically take a turn of losing points, right?

873
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,549
Speaker 0: But then your new Empire gets you more points.

874
00:54:57,569 --> 00:55:01,766
Speaker 0: where you're declining one still gets you some points and it evens out Yep, so you gotta decline at least once.

875
00:55:02,027 --> 00:55:11,678
Speaker 0: but if you can if you can defend and the territory You've claimed is large enough and worth enough points every turn that you won't actually gain any and no one can it.

876
00:55:11,738 --> 00:55:16,917
Speaker 0: no one assaults You to decrease your point value or they can't because your defense is so strong.

877
00:55:16,957 --> 00:55:17,820
Speaker 0: You can just sit on it.

878
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:18,227
Speaker 0: It's perfect.

879
00:55:18,268 --> 00:55:18,858
Speaker 0: What's wrong with that?

880
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:21,949
Speaker 0: Now the prize is calculating point maximum points per turn.

881
00:55:22,009 --> 00:55:26,102
Speaker 1: the problem is that is you give up the opportunity cost of when you decline You.

882
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:31,900
Speaker 1: the goal the point the purpose of declining is to come back on the board and fucking roll someone else.

883
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:34,071
Speaker 0: But if you're in first place, you don't need to roll someone else.

884
00:55:34,272 --> 00:55:35,860
Speaker 1: Yep, unless someone's getting close.

885
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,250
Speaker 1: So basically you only decline if you're in that winning strategy.

886
00:55:38,552 --> 00:55:43,814
Speaker 1: if there's a second place person who's close to you You pick an opportune turn and just decline all over them.

887
00:55:43,834 --> 00:55:46,425
Speaker 1: But otherwise, yeah Don't either.

888
00:55:46,646 --> 00:55:54,940
Speaker 0: you guys must have been sucking so much that a you didn't attack him Right B. There was never a better sieve to choose when he declined.

889
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:59,114
Speaker 1: So why'd have been in like a Nash equilibria situation word like no individual player.

890
00:55:59,174 --> 00:56:01,863
Speaker 1: declining would actually be better off Right.

891
00:56:02,084 --> 00:56:04,433
Speaker 0: Also, they're just hanging out in first place.

892
00:56:04,573 --> 00:56:05,537
Speaker 0: if they were in last place.

893
00:56:05,557 --> 00:56:06,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're gonna decline.

894
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:07,967
Speaker 0: They needed to catch up by doing something.

895
00:56:08,067 --> 00:56:11,320
Speaker 1: but now the iron I wonder because I haven't played small world underground.

896
00:56:11,521 --> 00:56:15,179
Speaker 1: But it's possible too that the iron dwarves might be slightly degenerate.

897
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,647
Speaker 1: Maybe that's I don't know.

898
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:17,551
Speaker 0: if I don't know what they do.

899
00:56:17,591 --> 00:56:18,416
Speaker 0: What it look up what they do.

900
00:56:18,436 --> 00:56:19,139
Speaker 1: Look up what they do.

901
00:56:19,702 --> 00:56:21,170
Speaker 1: iron is immortal.

902
00:56:21,331 --> 00:56:26,520
Speaker 1: iron dwarves, but Small world unlike Vinci has a set number of turns.

903
00:56:27,504 --> 00:56:27,935
Speaker 0: That's true.

904
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:33,480
Speaker 1: Warves as opposed to Vinci where the game ends when someone gets to a certain number of points.

905
00:56:34,085 --> 00:56:38,807
Speaker 1: So with a fixed number of turns There's a lot more Determinism to how the game will get.

906
00:56:38,827 --> 00:56:42,914
Speaker 0: immortal mean they don't die like you just always have the same number of dudes Even if they get killed.

907
00:56:44,183 --> 00:56:50,140
Speaker 1: So all I found is all these threads of people saying immortal iron dwarves fucking win the game and they never decline.

908
00:56:51,001 --> 00:56:53,249
Speaker 1: There are multiple set people as threads on board game.

909
00:56:53,289 --> 00:56:54,654
Speaker 0: What do they do though?

910
00:56:55,015 --> 00:56:56,280
Speaker 0: silver hammers is immortal mean?

911
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:59,320
Speaker 0: They don't die like you could get killed and you put them back on the board next turn.

912
00:56:59,564 --> 00:57:03,653
Speaker 0: Let's see That's the reason you decline is because your empire shrinking because people are killing it off.

913
00:57:03,693 --> 00:57:07,510
Speaker 0: if they're immortal as the word says Then yeah, you don't need to decline.

914
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:09,479
Speaker 0: you all used to love the same number of dudes you had before.

915
00:57:11,242 --> 00:57:12,491
Speaker 1: Uh, it's there's mines.

916
00:57:12,511 --> 00:57:13,700
Speaker 1: There's some complicated shit.

917
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:19,590
Speaker 1: So the rules don't make sense without the wider context of the additions in small world underground, I guess yeah I don't know.

918
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:29,940
Speaker 1: But I suspect degenerate combos are a much bigger problem in the small world variant than in the original Vinci just because of the deterministic number of turns.

919
00:57:30,211 --> 00:57:35,866
Speaker 1: Yeah Cuz you can predict if there's only three turns then if I decline now Then I'll come in on the board next turn.

920
00:57:35,907 --> 00:57:39,240
Speaker 1: then I've got one more turn as opposed to Vinci of will the game end?

921
00:57:39,441 --> 00:57:40,346
Speaker 1: Let's figure it out.

922
00:57:40,446 --> 00:57:42,517
Speaker 1: I could make the game end like that kind of stuff.

923
00:57:42,598 --> 00:57:49,728
Speaker 1: Yep I won code words by randomly guessing words that were far away from the other words of my team's color Shouldn't have worked, but we won.

924
00:57:50,451 --> 00:57:51,958
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess you can win that by luck.

925
00:57:52,159 --> 00:57:58,976
Speaker 1: Sure Yeah, you can also win that by Clever innuendo Or just by the right was the right way to play it.

926
00:57:58,997 --> 00:58:05,695
Speaker 1: Yeah I've seen people win Sheriff of Nottingham by focusing almost exclusively on illegal goods.

927
00:58:06,156 --> 00:58:08,045
Speaker 1: lies bribes people at least 80% of the time.

928
00:58:10,002 --> 00:58:11,592
Speaker 1: People say playing honest is best.

929
00:58:11,874 --> 00:58:12,840
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.

930
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:14,906
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a lot game.

931
00:58:14,946 --> 00:58:25,057
Speaker 1: if you can play Sheriff of Nottingham and you happen to have like five apples in your hand That is the best possible thing you could do right because it's a win-win no matter what right.

932
00:58:25,077 --> 00:58:34,080
Speaker 0: and if someone if no one Calls you out you at least get them the minimum number of points or the five apples and if they open your bag You're just getting even more points and you get your five, you know, busy only benefit, right?

933
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:35,950
Speaker 0: You can get this much or that much and more.

934
00:58:36,433 --> 00:58:37,600
Speaker 0: so that's you know with honesty.

935
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:42,380
Speaker 0: But if you don't have a lot of legal goods, you know, why not try the illegal goods?

936
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:46,126
Speaker 0: You can get you know negative a little bit Maybe not much.

937
00:58:46,166 --> 00:58:58,648
Speaker 0: you can maybe put in some legal ones to cancel it out And if you're get through super big money It's you know, there's not really any sort of weird strategy and Sheriff of Nottingham It's like any.

938
00:58:58,708 --> 00:59:00,140
Speaker 0: pretty much any move is valid.

939
00:59:00,381 --> 00:59:05,397
Speaker 1: I think most strategies people come up with rely on trying to second-guess other people.

940
00:59:05,437 --> 00:59:06,420
Speaker 1: poison cup situation.

941
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:09,353
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, it's just put whatever the fuck you want in the bag and then go for it.

942
00:59:09,514 --> 00:59:12,287
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, yeah It's yeah, they're gonna work.

943
00:59:12,508 --> 00:59:13,795
Speaker 0: They open it or they're not right.

944
00:59:13,875 --> 00:59:22,368
Speaker 1: So there's a strategy I was gonna try at some point but I was thinking of always putting four goods in my bag no matter what and Always offering a two coin bribe no matter what.

945
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:25,600
Speaker 0: I mean if I have five apples, why would I put four apples?

946
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:28,231
Speaker 1: Well, it's for consistency to remove any human.

947
00:59:28,372 --> 00:59:30,020
Speaker 0: You're just losing a point if you do that.

948
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:32,060
Speaker 0: Maybe more maybe more than a point.

949
00:59:32,501 --> 00:59:36,335
Speaker 1: This guy's favorite play and sheriff is stuffing a bag with five illegals to five crossbows.

950
00:59:36,717 --> 00:59:41,280
Speaker 1: and yeah in the offer I'll give you ten gold if you open everyone's bag including my own.

951
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:47,194
Speaker 1: hmm That's a clever sort of gambit to scare the sheriff.

952
00:59:47,275 --> 00:59:51,658
Speaker 0: I guess I'd say okay Give me the ten and then I'll open all the bags including his.

953
00:59:51,698 --> 00:59:53,423
Speaker 0: yeah Yeah Just like you said.

954
00:59:53,944 --> 01:00:04,522
Speaker 1: cuz actually the the penalty to the sheriff of opening a bag that was legit is way less bad Than the penalty to you if the sheriff opens your bag and you were lying bad Mm-hmm.

955
01:00:05,104 --> 01:00:05,907
Speaker 1: It's real bad.

956
01:00:05,927 --> 01:00:08,355
Speaker 1: If you have five crossbows and the sheriff's like, let me open that bag.

957
01:00:08,375 --> 01:00:09,178
Speaker 1: What's going on in there?

958
01:00:09,198 --> 01:00:17,321
Speaker 1: Yeah But yeah, I mean I like sheriff of Nottingham looks like there's a lot of people talking about it, but The game is not a super good Like.

959
01:00:17,341 --> 01:00:21,440
Speaker 0: if you don't know how you put that in a thread of unusual strategy because the game has no unusual strategy.

960
01:00:21,681 --> 01:00:24,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like there's no valid or invalid moves.

961
01:00:25,512 --> 01:00:27,980
Speaker 1: Oh, we played one game of Catan where I just went for dev cards.

962
01:00:28,225 --> 01:00:31,586
Speaker 1: I guess this guy Rediscovered the old stiffy card strategy.

963
01:00:31,847 --> 01:00:33,934
Speaker 0: You don't say you did that.

964
01:00:34,436 --> 01:00:43,670
Speaker 1: you only had you know Not the usual wheat and stone city and development card strat Just development cards because he couldn't build any settlements.

965
01:00:44,251 --> 01:00:45,134
Speaker 1: You know getting nine points.

966
01:00:45,796 --> 01:00:47,160
Speaker 1: Oh, he's talking about cities and nights.

967
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,426
Speaker 0: Totally different game whatever.

968
01:00:49,627 --> 01:00:50,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's it.

969
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:50,952
Speaker 1: That's not that.

970
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:52,980
Speaker 1: Let's see take it to ride.

971
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:57,780
Speaker 1: We discovered the best way to get points was to build one good distance route and then pick up tickets.

972
01:00:57,860 --> 01:01:01,112
Speaker 1: You can hopefully finish with a minimal number of branches off your main route.

973
01:01:01,312 --> 01:01:01,613
Speaker 0: Yes.

974
01:01:01,834 --> 01:01:02,597
Speaker 0: That's the base.

975
01:01:02,757 --> 01:01:03,500
Speaker 0: That's not unusual.

976
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,006
Speaker 0: That's how you win ticket to ride.

977
01:01:05,087 --> 01:01:12,280
Speaker 0: every time I win ticket to ride which is most of the times I've played I have a Big ass long route and all of my smaller routes are contained within it.

978
01:01:12,621 --> 01:01:16,560
Speaker 0: So I get I put down a train is doing double duty and completing multiple routes.

979
01:01:17,046 --> 01:01:18,040
Speaker 1: Oh, this guy's a troll.

980
01:01:18,121 --> 01:01:19,580
Speaker 1: I ended up having an awful game one.

981
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:23,877
Speaker 1: So I got pissed off and decided to screw everyone else by spending every turn picking up tickets and keeping them all.

982
01:01:24,259 --> 01:01:25,484
Speaker 1: I had no Intention trying to finish them.

983
01:01:25,504 --> 01:01:28,800
Speaker 1: I was just playing a material denial strategy to prevent my friends from doing well.

984
01:01:29,141 --> 01:01:31,067
Speaker 1: I ended with negative 143 points.

985
01:01:31,508 --> 01:01:32,130
Speaker 1: You're just a dick.

986
01:01:32,612 --> 01:01:33,715
Speaker 0: Yeah, fuck you.

987
01:01:33,735 --> 01:01:40,480
Speaker 1: Uh This guy claims to have won a paper rock scissors tournament by always picking rock.

988
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:44,106
Speaker 0: Maybe it's not unusual though.

989
01:01:44,387 --> 01:01:46,775
Speaker 0: Yeah, it just I mean no one noticed.

990
01:01:48,099 --> 01:01:54,971
Speaker 1: Oh There's a bunch of people talking about in viticulture Winning the game by not making any wine.

991
01:01:55,092 --> 01:01:57,420
Speaker 0: wasn't there a situation where they changed the rules so you can do?

992
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:00,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, they had to a rat of that which that's all separate situation.

993
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:03,197
Speaker 1: That's viticulture when we first played it like it.

994
01:02:03,843 --> 01:02:04,164
Speaker 1: It's not.

995
01:02:04,185 --> 01:02:05,953
Speaker 1: that is necessarily that bad of a game like.

996
01:02:05,973 --> 01:02:07,360
Speaker 1: it's clever and I like a lot of what it's doing.

997
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:23,003
Speaker 1: But if the part where the aging of the wines is a little messed up It was like the concepts were too muddled and it was very in elegant mechanically yeah, so I suspected that any deep analysis would find a bunch of either broken strategies or Degenerate stuff.

998
01:02:23,504 --> 01:02:24,588
Speaker 1: It looks like there was one.

999
01:02:24,608 --> 01:02:25,330
Speaker 1: Yep.

1000
01:02:25,571 --> 01:02:30,143
Speaker 1: I didn't winning didn't make anyone not one bottle and People are talking about it.

1001
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:31,126
Speaker 0: Just give wine tours.

1002
01:02:31,467 --> 01:02:35,097
Speaker 1: Yeah, they had to make specific errata to say to fix that.

1003
01:02:35,117 --> 01:02:40,940
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm The problem with any I mean, why did you award someone victory points in your rules for doing something?

1004
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:42,958
Speaker 0: That wasn't making wine in the winemaking game.

1005
01:02:43,625 --> 01:02:53,275
Speaker 1: well, I mean in in Kayla's you can make money by pleasing the king and the giant castle is the whole focus of the game or Just by going after gold and other stuff.

1006
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:53,860
Speaker 0: That's not it.

1007
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:54,944
Speaker 0: It's not easy to do though.

1008
01:02:55,205 --> 01:03:02,454
Speaker 0: And actually those tiles like expansion special tiles that weren't in the original Yeah, yeah, if you didn't have that there's really only one way to win Kayla's.

1009
01:03:02,675 --> 01:03:07,007
Speaker 1: Yeah, unless everyone sucks There's a lot of talk about the rules of.

1010
01:03:07,228 --> 01:03:09,254
Speaker 1: people are not sure what rules are in there's.

1011
01:03:09,616 --> 01:03:13,540
Speaker 1: it's like these people look like They're arguing about how to score farmers in Carcassonne.

1012
01:03:13,721 --> 01:03:23,625
Speaker 0: So these people are into board games enough that they're in the board game reddit subreddit and they're hanging out and commenting But they don't understand the actual games they're playing.

1013
01:03:24,186 --> 01:03:24,908
Speaker 1: Well, you know it.

1014
01:03:25,208 --> 01:03:30,349
Speaker 1: to be fair in this case Different rule books say different things like people don't know.

1015
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:33,419
Speaker 1: quote any link on this errata like they don't know about it.

1016
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:34,864
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'm saying in general.

1017
01:03:35,024 --> 01:03:37,070
Speaker 1: I would definitely like to shut this strategy down.

1018
01:03:38,502 --> 01:03:39,268
Speaker 0: It's how about you?

1019
01:03:39,308 --> 01:03:40,718
Speaker 0: just don't play that crappy game.

1020
01:03:40,758 --> 01:03:42,024
Speaker 1: It's okay Yeah, it's kind of a side point.

1021
01:03:42,084 --> 01:03:52,820
Speaker 1: but the games that come out of like their traditional like Eurogamer circuit Tend seem to have a lot of play testing and tend to be at least elegant or don't have degenerate strategies like that.

1022
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:56,820
Speaker 1: Like they'll break down in other more fundamental ways in the long run because all games break down.

1023
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:10,651
Speaker 1: But all these Kickstarter games and like a lot of the games that are coming out of the US or coming out of like newer game designers They seem to skimp on the play testing and like not notice these really bad degenerate strategies Like long after they publish the game.

1024
01:04:10,671 --> 01:04:12,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, that seems like a trend.

1025
01:04:14,876 --> 01:04:16,233
Speaker 1: hmm, oh My god people are talking about that a lot.

1026
01:04:17,981 --> 01:04:22,739
Speaker 1: Friend tried a strategy where he chose prospector every time he chose a role in San Juan and beat us soundly.

1027
01:04:23,302 --> 01:04:24,125
Speaker 0: You guys just sucked.

1028
01:04:24,728 --> 01:04:26,235
Speaker 1: also San Juan is not a good game.

1029
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:30,308
Speaker 1: Yeah I could see prosper that working pretty well.

1030
01:04:30,368 --> 01:04:32,979
Speaker 0: because the game is everyone keeps choosing everything else for you.

1031
01:04:33,762 --> 01:04:37,640
Speaker 0: You know, well that games also prospector only benefits you and you take it, right?

1032
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:38,945
Speaker 1: It's just so reliant on the cards.

1033
01:04:38,986 --> 01:04:42,220
Speaker 1: you get like if you happen to get silver and full of silver mines.

1034
01:04:42,481 --> 01:04:44,370
Speaker 1: Just play the only building silver mine strategy.

1035
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:45,455
Speaker 1: You almost guaranteed win.

1036
01:04:45,576 --> 01:04:46,400
Speaker 0: That's how we always won.

1037
01:04:46,741 --> 01:04:49,936
Speaker 1: Yep, the only time I wouldn't win with that is if I didn't draw silver mines.

1038
01:04:50,237 --> 01:04:50,539
Speaker 0: It's a.

1039
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:56,256
Speaker 1: uh My daughter who was five was playing love letter and discarded the countess.

1040
01:04:56,316 --> 01:04:57,020
Speaker 1: on her first turn.

1041
01:04:57,521 --> 01:04:57,923
Speaker 1: It turned out.

1042
01:04:57,963 --> 01:04:59,127
Speaker 1: her other card was the priest.

1043
01:04:59,408 --> 01:05:00,793
Speaker 1: I thought she was making a mistake.

1044
01:05:01,054 --> 01:05:01,516
Speaker 1: She wasn't.

1045
01:05:01,656 --> 01:05:02,579
Speaker 1: she was screwing with us.

1046
01:05:03,081 --> 01:05:05,250
Speaker 1: I threw us off so bad round netted pretty quickly.

1047
01:05:05,270 --> 01:05:07,980
Speaker 1: I kind of stuff just happens in really small short games.

1048
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:12,133
Speaker 1: I mean if there's only a few cards and you draw them the odds are weird.

1049
01:05:12,173 --> 01:05:13,437
Speaker 1: combos come up pretty often.

1050
01:05:13,457 --> 01:05:14,686
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I also.

1051
01:05:14,728 --> 01:05:19,300
Speaker 1: it's a Love letter is fun because it's quick, but it's not enjoyable.

1052
01:05:19,561 --> 01:05:21,994
Speaker 0: It's also what you get for trying to play the player and not play the game.

1053
01:05:22,014 --> 01:05:29,671
Speaker 1: Yeah Thing is most of these kinds of games will break down to trying to play the player or doing the poison cup thing Don't do that.

1054
01:05:31,381 --> 01:05:35,220
Speaker 1: We were playing a ticket to ride game with a card hoarder who was a new person to our group.

1055
01:05:35,623 --> 01:05:36,590
Speaker 1: Alright so someone came to.

1056
01:05:36,611 --> 01:05:36,711
Speaker 1: it's.

1057
01:05:36,732 --> 01:05:37,719
Speaker 1: a stranger came to town.

1058
01:05:39,261 --> 01:05:40,225
Speaker 1: We were warned.

1059
01:05:40,305 --> 01:05:43,739
Speaker 1: she claims routes only near the end of the game and wins every time.

1060
01:05:44,542 --> 01:05:46,889
Speaker 0: So you even knew what the strategy was in advance?

1061
01:05:47,029 --> 01:05:48,112
Speaker 1: Oh, apparently they crush her.

1062
01:05:48,453 --> 01:05:50,680
Speaker 1: Nobody had ever tried to block her routes before.

1063
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:56,915
Speaker 1: Okay, so this was the stranger comes to town with the undefeated record and the weird strategy.

1064
01:05:56,935 --> 01:06:01,289
Speaker 1: and she comes to town and in the Town, they're like, we just won't let you finish those routes.

1065
01:06:01,349 --> 01:06:01,510
Speaker 1: Now.

1066
01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:02,854
Speaker 1: What what?

1067
01:06:03,275 --> 01:06:04,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, all the routes have been taken.

1068
01:06:04,942 --> 01:06:05,488
Speaker 0: What are you gonna do?

1069
01:06:05,548 --> 01:06:06,416
Speaker 0: card hoarding person?

1070
01:06:06,436 --> 01:06:09,928
Speaker 1: Yeah I'll card hoard in Alhambra.

1071
01:06:10,009 --> 01:06:12,700
Speaker 1: actually all the card organ Alhambra like ignore the first score.

1072
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:13,963
Speaker 0: Yeah That works a little bit.

1073
01:06:14,024 --> 01:06:15,669
Speaker 1: or die hell out of those.

1074
01:06:15,850 --> 01:06:19,363
Speaker 1: like if you can pick up like a 1 1 2 like little currency Go for it.

1075
01:06:19,865 --> 01:06:21,733
Speaker 1: Just get a giant hand on ones and twos.

1076
01:06:21,753 --> 01:06:23,340
Speaker 0: There's no limit on cards in your hand.

1077
01:06:23,601 --> 01:06:26,012
Speaker 1: There is I'm pretty sure there's no limit on cards in your hand.

1078
01:06:26,032 --> 01:06:26,555
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

1079
01:06:26,575 --> 01:06:29,726
Speaker 1: in a Splendor there's a limit of 10.

1080
01:06:29,726 --> 01:06:32,414
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's real important or splendor wouldn't work.

1081
01:06:33,317 --> 01:06:37,167
Speaker 0: I don't play in splendor lately Uh, I don't lose it splendor too much.

1082
01:06:37,187 --> 01:06:40,760
Speaker 1: Uh, I was there was a pretty close game the other night.

1083
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:46,179
Speaker 1: it was lost in the girls and Natalie was like prime to win.

1084
01:06:46,681 --> 01:06:52,000
Speaker 1: But the whole time Emily was building up this combo and then suddenly Emily was like but but but but points over game over.

1085
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:57,318
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean I've tried to do the both the get lots of small ones and then start getting free stuff.

1086
01:06:57,459 --> 01:07:01,320
Speaker 0: machine Yeah, and I've also tried the big stuff one and I think the small stuff one is just better.

1087
01:07:01,682 --> 01:07:03,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah the cards come out.

1088
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:05,078
Speaker 0: it's on my turn I get a free card free car.

1089
01:07:05,099 --> 01:07:12,511
Speaker 0: eventually I was like I only have to take tokens in the early game and pretty much every turn after that is just card card card And you'll end the game with like a few big ones.

1090
01:07:12,571 --> 01:07:14,020
Speaker 0: and then I have two or three of the nobles.

1091
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,167
Speaker 0: Well, I have to get the nobles.

1092
01:07:15,207 --> 01:07:17,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I usually get two or three nobles and I end the game.

1093
01:07:17,601 --> 01:07:21,840
Speaker 1: I usually go for that if I see multiple novers nobles with a heavy overlap of what they want.

1094
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,125
Speaker 0: But it's real easy.

1095
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:30,298
Speaker 1: if there's something you could get for free that is not in the combo of the nobles You're gonna have the discipline to not take it.

1096
01:07:31,341 --> 01:07:35,093
Speaker 1: Mmm, like don't take the freebie that literally doesn't help you spend that turn.

1097
01:07:35,133 --> 01:07:37,140
Speaker 1: picking up gold or spend so many victory points is worth.

1098
01:07:37,261 --> 01:07:40,000
Speaker 0: Sometimes there's a card worth like three points and the nobles were three.

1099
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:43,332
Speaker 1: I once won a three player seven wonders game by not building a single resource.

1100
01:07:43,553 --> 01:07:45,239
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's like strategy number four.

1101
01:07:45,963 --> 01:07:46,909
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's like.

1102
01:07:46,949 --> 01:07:50,263
Speaker 1: that is like a game strategy Constrain stringing.

1103
01:07:50,303 --> 01:07:51,266
Speaker 0: this isn't unusual.

1104
01:07:51,707 --> 01:07:55,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, is there any strategies in the Strad that are actually meet what the title of the thread says?

1105
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:56,626
Speaker 0: Which is unusual.

1106
01:07:57,028 --> 01:07:58,576
Speaker 1: Well, they might be unusual for that group.

1107
01:07:58,958 --> 01:08:03,951
Speaker 1: Sure Founding fathers looking for game of mafia.

1108
01:08:03,971 --> 01:08:04,914
Speaker 1: Oh mafia.

1109
01:08:04,975 --> 01:08:10,711
Speaker 1: with three mafia and 12 town One of the mafia outed himself and offered himself to the chopping block.

1110
01:08:11,373 --> 01:08:13,960
Speaker 1: No one believed him and the mafia won.

1111
01:08:15,762 --> 01:08:22,120
Speaker 1: Okay, uh The only thing I say about mafia is I do still enjoy that game if played like once a year like Illuminati.

1112
01:08:22,383 --> 01:08:26,166
Speaker 0: I just want to play it the original way but I have to communicate during the day.

1113
01:08:26,367 --> 01:08:30,439
Speaker 1: probably the most poignant moment is sort of proving the breakdown of those like perfect strategies.

1114
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:31,285
Speaker 1: and It's a friend of ours.

1115
01:08:31,305 --> 01:08:31,930
Speaker 1: It was Phil.

1116
01:08:32,495 --> 01:08:33,180
Speaker 1: The game started.

1117
01:08:33,341 --> 01:08:35,548
Speaker 1: He was obviously not mafia and he was like guys.

1118
01:08:35,868 --> 01:08:40,124
Speaker 1: and he was like, let's just systematically eliminate everyone We're guaranteed to win.

1119
01:08:40,384 --> 01:08:51,064
Speaker 1: and he's trying to outline the strategy and all the mafia just like played along with it but then acted confused and gay like started to mess stuff up and It like one round.

1120
01:08:51,104 --> 01:08:53,676
Speaker 1: the strategy failed it misfired and then it was too late.

1121
01:08:53,716 --> 01:08:54,600
Speaker 1: the mafia were guaranteed to win.

1122
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:55,042
Speaker 1: It was over.

1123
01:08:55,584 --> 01:08:57,795
Speaker 1: you can disrupt those things socially pretty easily.

1124
01:08:57,814 --> 01:09:02,471
Speaker 1: Mmm Dracula pirate lord of the high seas furry of Dracula.

1125
01:09:02,511 --> 01:09:04,256
Speaker 1: that is a game strategy.

1126
01:09:04,337 --> 01:09:06,743
Speaker 1: Once again I've played that round.

1127
01:09:06,764 --> 01:09:14,714
Speaker 1: we like you start on an island you go ocean ocean double back ocean And just basically stay off the map for a while.

1128
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:18,533
Speaker 0: Yep It's too easy for them to find you on land.

1129
01:09:18,573 --> 01:09:21,143
Speaker 1: Yeah Tragedy looper.

1130
01:09:21,162 --> 01:09:22,911
Speaker 1: I don't know what that game is village.

1131
01:09:22,951 --> 01:09:23,573
Speaker 1: Very smart moves.

1132
01:09:23,635 --> 01:09:28,220
Speaker 1: as one of your family members beginning I'm promising new current town hall and have him die of a heart attack on his first day.

1133
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:49,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, that game is all about killing your people like as soon as possible like kill people early and often yeah, which is actually why I don't like the game because the the conceit of the game Sort of breaks like like what the fiction of the game world is and like the analogy of it kind of breaks down when the strategies Really break down to kill people all the time and push the clock.

1134
01:09:49,461 --> 01:09:53,319
Speaker 0: I think that the problem in the game is simply the timing and pacing of it is.

1135
01:09:53,560 --> 01:10:00,293
Speaker 0: It should be a game where you can get a lot more work out of people before they die And then you would get more stuff happening, right?

1136
01:10:00,394 --> 01:10:06,615
Speaker 1: It seems like, you know, it'd be more fun That there are a bunch of people complaining about winning games of small world without ever declining.

1137
01:10:06,636 --> 01:10:13,680
Speaker 1: This is regular small world Skeletons fortified kept putting fortresses down till I was maxed out.

1138
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:17,315
Speaker 1: Position myself for going after me would be costly.

1139
01:10:17,577 --> 01:10:19,658
Speaker 0: just waited And it worked.

1140
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:24,518
Speaker 0: Yeah Cuz I mean anyone who goes after you to prevent you from winning will not be the winner and you won't.

1141
01:10:24,558 --> 01:10:25,543
Speaker 0: you won't be the Winner either.

1142
01:10:25,905 --> 01:10:30,437
Speaker 0: one of the other people who don't do who don't bite the bullet will be the winner But if no one does it you're gonna win.

1143
01:10:31,362 --> 01:10:36,486
Speaker 1: risk taking over Asia first, uh What's unusual about that?

1144
01:10:36,527 --> 01:10:38,155
Speaker 0: If you can take over Asia you can win the game.

1145
01:10:38,255 --> 01:10:39,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, it's just dice.

1146
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:42,131
Speaker 0: You might get lucky score the highest point continent first.

1147
01:10:42,633 --> 01:10:43,075
Speaker 0: Okay.

1148
01:10:43,356 --> 01:10:43,677
Speaker 0: What's that?

1149
01:10:43,697 --> 01:10:44,360
Speaker 0: Was that unusual?

1150
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:53,489
Speaker 1: Stone Age starvation strategy, uh Uh Grow a really large family ignore farming and food a hundred percent.

1151
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:56,578
Speaker 1: Apparently that's a winnable strategy not in Agricola though.

1152
01:10:56,859 --> 01:11:02,993
Speaker 1: Nope that I kind of a problem with all the games that followed after Agricola that are like.

1153
01:11:03,013 --> 01:11:12,009
Speaker 1: in that vein of like make a machine and then You got to feed your people because they all like the analogies start to break down It will lahav like doesn't fucking make any actual sense.

1154
01:11:12,471 --> 01:11:13,173
Speaker 1: It's not a bad game.

1155
01:11:13,193 --> 01:11:14,156
Speaker 1: It doesn't make any sense.

1156
01:11:14,597 --> 01:11:17,504
Speaker 1: Yeah Two player block is.

1157
01:11:17,684 --> 01:11:18,406
Speaker 1: I went first.

1158
01:11:18,627 --> 01:11:23,659
Speaker 1: he mirrored every single move of mine for the entire game except the very last move.

1159
01:11:25,401 --> 01:11:25,863
Speaker 0: They win.

1160
01:11:26,103 --> 01:11:27,628
Speaker 1: he played a better piece and won.

1161
01:11:28,149 --> 01:11:29,213
Speaker 1: we played it again.

1162
01:11:29,353 --> 01:11:31,540
Speaker 0: Why didn't you play that same piece?

1163
01:11:33,121 --> 01:11:35,207
Speaker 0: Also to play right she went first.

1164
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:37,713
Speaker 0: he went second in two-player block.

1165
01:11:37,814 --> 01:11:43,319
Speaker 0: is it should be possible for you to play in such A way that they cannot marry you because you fucking block them?

1166
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:49,557
Speaker 0: Yep Why do you played a piece in every turn that which could just be mirrored so that you cut the exact same score?

1167
01:11:49,577 --> 01:11:50,219
Speaker 0: and then?

1168
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:57,899
Speaker 0: The very final piece when you could only each play one more piece yet the exact same board You played a suboptimal piece that they can play a better one.

1169
01:11:58,822 --> 01:12:00,206
Speaker 0: So you just stupid.

1170
01:12:00,728 --> 01:12:08,656
Speaker 1: not sure if this is strange or the best but in camel up which he spelled wrong I never roll unless I am first to play on that leg.

1171
01:12:09,078 --> 01:12:12,152
Speaker 1: other than that I always leg bet tiles or overall bets.

1172
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:18,020
Speaker 0: Ah Yes, you I only roll after a whole bunch of betting is happened.

1173
01:12:18,261 --> 01:12:22,679
Speaker 1: No, but he never rolls unless he is the first to play on that leg.

1174
01:12:24,081 --> 01:12:29,020
Speaker 0: If I'm going first why would you go first and give everyone else free information and just take a dollar for yourself?

1175
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:31,419
Speaker 1: It sounds like the opposite of what he should do.

1176
01:12:31,685 --> 01:12:33,666
Speaker 0: Yes I should be betting first.

1177
01:12:33,727 --> 01:12:36,579
Speaker 0: that or the first thing you want to do is put your oasis your desert out.

1178
01:12:36,619 --> 01:12:41,760
Speaker 1: now It depends how many players there are because if you're playing with a small number of players you roll you're gonna get more actions.

1179
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:45,215
Speaker 1: Yeah, it'll come back around to you and all the things you could have taken more like.

1180
01:12:45,476 --> 01:12:47,266
Speaker 1: I could see that working But in a full game no way.

1181
01:12:47,689 --> 01:12:48,433
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

1182
01:12:48,856 --> 01:12:49,540
Speaker 0: winner of the thread.

1183
01:12:50,122 --> 01:12:52,931
Speaker 1: Someone said someone asterix was like it's camel up.

1184
01:12:53,473 --> 01:12:55,499
Speaker 1: Someone else said no, it's a mole cup.

1185
01:12:58,925 --> 01:12:59,499
Speaker 0: You're the winner.

1186
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:01,786
Speaker 1: Con man out you.

1187
01:13:01,806 --> 01:13:03,212
Speaker 1: that's the funniest thing I've seen all day.

1188
01:13:03,232 --> 01:13:04,116
Speaker 0: Can I go eat now?

1189
01:13:04,517 --> 01:13:05,120
Speaker 1: You want to be done?

1190
01:13:05,301 --> 01:13:05,944
Speaker 0: I want to be done.

1191
01:13:05,964 --> 01:13:06,849
Speaker 1: All right, let me see there.

1192
01:13:06,869 --> 01:13:08,939
Speaker 1: I'm gonna skip through this caching guns.

1193
01:13:11,201 --> 01:13:11,783
Speaker 1: I'm skipping through.

1194
01:13:11,803 --> 01:13:13,911
Speaker 1: there's a lot of interesting stuff in this thread.

1195
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:16,420
Speaker 1: We'll just leave it at that good hungry.

1196
01:13:22,182 --> 01:13:24,720
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

1197
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:29,499
Speaker 1: Thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows.

1204
01:13:52,196 --> 01:13:53,499
Speaker 0: It's actually recorded at night

1206
01:14:48,669 --> 01:14:54,040
Speaker 1: Multiple of you conspired to make me laugh, and that credit points to.

1207
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:56,989
Speaker 1: But yeah, many of you have been playing Overwatch with me.

1208
01:14:57,049 --> 01:14:59,320
Speaker 1: Many of you will be playing Overwatch with me.

1209
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:00,664
Speaker 1: Valhalla just came out.

1210
01:15:00,724 --> 01:15:02,612
Speaker 1: I say everyone's playing that instead of Overwatch.

1211
01:15:03,214 --> 01:15:04,600
Speaker 1: But, Kineticon's coming up.

1212
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,492
Speaker 1: We're basically done doing the schedule and a lot of the work I have to do before Kineticon.

1213
01:15:08,973 --> 01:15:12,243
Speaker 1: So, hopefully this weekend I should get another remastered Geek Nights up.

1214
01:15:12,824 --> 01:15:20,060
Speaker 1: I got a whole queue of Rim's Rants, and more importantly, I should have the Utena episode, episode 15 up too.

1215
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:21,262
Speaker 1: It's mostly edited.

1216
01:15:21,282 --> 01:15:23,950
Speaker 1: I just haven't had time to finish it, getting all the Kineticon work done.

1217
01:15:24,411 --> 01:15:27,720
Speaker 1: But after Kineticon, I have nothing significant to do until PAX.

1218
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:31,812
Speaker 1: And PAX panels are a lot easier to write because I don't have to schedule the entirety of PAX.

1219
01:15:31,912 --> 01:15:34,280
Speaker 1: I just have to do one or maybe two panels.

1220
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:37,120
Speaker 1: So anyway, now I leave you with something else.

1221
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,425
Speaker 2: Here's the baby's bath.

1222
01:15:39,987 --> 01:15:40,488
Speaker 2: Here's the baby.

1223
01:15:40,528 --> 01:15:42,874
Speaker 2: I'm not even going to try and draw arms and legs.

1224
01:15:42,914 --> 01:15:45,480
Speaker 2: So, sad baby because quite frankly, yeah.

1225
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:46,622
Speaker 2: Electricity.

1226
01:15:47,284 --> 01:15:50,997
Speaker 2: And just for the sake of completeness, let's put its Mr.

1227
01:15:51,037 --> 01:15:51,720
Speaker 2: Whippy in its head.

1228
01:15:52,441 --> 01:15:53,006
Speaker 2: Whippy.

1229
01:15:53,289 --> 01:15:53,571
Speaker 2: Whippy.

1230
01:15:54,076 --> 01:15:54,298
Speaker 1: Whippy.

1231
01:15:56,201 --> 01:15:57,142
Speaker 2: And here's the electrode.

1232
01:16:00,026 --> 01:16:00,747
Speaker 2: Plugged into the wall.

1233
01:16:01,068 --> 01:16:01,689
Speaker 2: Accidentally.

1234
01:16:02,089 --> 01:16:02,610
Speaker 2: There's the water.

1235
01:16:04,572 --> 01:16:06,562
Speaker 2: And this would act as a potential divider.

1236
01:16:06,582 --> 01:16:09,130
Speaker 2: It would be putting out if that was 220.

1237
01:16:09,130 --> 01:16:10,675
Speaker 2: This would be putting out 110.

1238
01:16:10,675 --> 01:16:14,870
Speaker 2: Roughly the midpoint of, well unless of course, actually how does that go?

1239
01:16:16,251 --> 01:16:17,835
Speaker 2: You know, it's quite complex.

1240
01:16:17,915 --> 01:16:19,478
Speaker 2: It's quite an odd resistor network.

1241
01:16:19,518 --> 01:16:25,130
Speaker 2: But other than that, the water would be forming another resistor from the midpoint of that.

1242
01:16:25,270 --> 01:16:26,955
Speaker 2: Oh, this is boiling quite ferociously now.

1243
01:16:27,838 --> 01:16:31,790
Speaker 2: The currents, the voltage, the power's going down.

1244
01:16:32,730 --> 01:16:36,910
Speaker 2: But yeah, so touching the baby, if it was dropped into that water, you would get a shock.

1245
01:16:36,990 --> 01:16:46,030
Speaker 2: But it would depend on the conductivity of the water, how far the baby was from the electrode, and how grounded you were at the time.

1246
01:16:46,510 --> 01:16:49,730
Speaker 2: So rubber gloves for baby handling in live water perhaps.
