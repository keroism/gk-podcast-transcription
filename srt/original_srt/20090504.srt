1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,317
Speaker 1: Hey, it's Monday, May 4th.

2
00:00:11,558 --> 00:00:11,999
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,670
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nides tonight's typing.

4
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,917
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:36,830
Speaker 1: So I realized the other day kind of shockingly that 90s nostalgia is soon going to be the thing.

6
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,560
Speaker 1: and I realized this when I saw Fern Gully.

7
00:00:40,382 --> 00:00:44,628
Speaker 1: Suddenly everyone on the internet was talking about Fern Gully I think because it was on the Netflix on demand.

8
00:00:44,668 --> 00:00:47,159
Speaker 1: all of a sudden and we all remember Fern Gully is 90s.

9
00:00:48,044 --> 00:00:49,879
Speaker 1: I thought I'm pretty sure that was a 90s movie.

10
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:50,883
Speaker 1: Scott I'm just gonna check.

11
00:00:50,983 --> 00:00:55,119
Speaker 1: it had a surfer guy named Zach and it was about the rainforests.

12
00:00:55,841 --> 00:00:56,202
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

13
00:00:56,604 --> 00:00:58,750
Speaker 1: There is no way that movie wasn't made in the 90s.

14
00:00:58,911 --> 00:00:59,152
Speaker 1: Wow.

15
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,038
Speaker 0: I can't find it on IMDb.

16
00:01:01,078 --> 00:01:01,600
Speaker 0: What the fuck?

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,785
Speaker 1: There's no way it's not an IMDb.

18
00:01:04,307 --> 00:01:05,731
Speaker 1: Not that it was a good movie.

19
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:06,855
Speaker 0: Oh, there it is.

20
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,460
Speaker 0: It's always was one word.

21
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,567
Speaker 0: That's why I couldn't get it.

22
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:17,759
Speaker 0: Okay, Fern Gully 1 92 Gully 2 The magical rescue.

23
00:01:20,521 --> 00:01:22,251
Speaker 0: Wow, oh there's a trailer.

24
00:01:22,573 --> 00:01:23,780
Speaker 1: we don't need to watch the trailer.

25
00:01:24,483 --> 00:01:26,471
Speaker 1: I mean, I saw the land before time seven.

26
00:01:26,512 --> 00:01:28,440
Speaker 0: I don't you saw the land before time seven.

27
00:01:29,561 --> 00:01:31,550
Speaker 0: I'm gonna find out how many land before times there are here.

28
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,425
Speaker 1: I go to Wikipedia, but it just I Wasn't that long ago.

29
00:01:35,505 --> 00:01:38,700
Speaker 1: someone was someone in the crew brought up something about the nostalgia culture.

30
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,240
Speaker 1: How come how come it was all 80s nostalgia or is the next generation not gonna be full of nostalgia?

31
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:48,160
Speaker 1: And then we all kind of pointed out that we're right about that time.

32
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:58,639
Speaker 1: We're just gonna turn into 90s nostalgia because our generation, you know The late 80s early 90s are getting to the age where the 80s nostalgia came out when those people hit our age.

33
00:01:59,442 --> 00:02:09,596
Speaker 0: Okay, according to Wikipedia on the land before time series page because if you just go to land before time It talks about the first movie, but there's a land before time series page on Wikipedia.

34
00:02:09,656 --> 00:02:10,580
Speaker 1: What's it say about Petrie?

35
00:02:10,982 --> 00:02:11,565
Speaker 1: Here's the man.

36
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:12,348
Speaker 0: it doesn't say anything.

37
00:02:12,388 --> 00:02:18,252
Speaker 0: it says says it says that there were ahem done done done done.

38
00:02:18,453 --> 00:02:24,538
Speaker 0: in current existence There are 13 lands before time Jesus and next year.

39
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,711
Speaker 0: Well in 2009 land before time 14 will exist.

40
00:02:29,972 --> 00:02:32,297
Speaker 1: It's not like they could avert the apocalypse.

41
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:42,000
Speaker 0: I Think it might be something that's like someone is paying to keep going in order to like, you know Train animators or something like, you know, I just I don't know.

42
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,426
Speaker 0: I mean, it's like you can break.

43
00:02:43,486 --> 00:02:46,760
Speaker 0: I think that's my guess is you can break into the animation industry.

44
00:02:47,121 --> 00:02:50,938
Speaker 0: It's like you get on the land before time and then you can work on something else.

45
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:59,326
Speaker 1: as you know Maybe the land before time is like hentai in Japan because half the great voice actors We know started out in hentai.

46
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,333
Speaker 0: Oh, it could be something in.

47
00:03:01,573 --> 00:03:05,103
Speaker 1: ever since I found out who the rape man really was I've just been disillusioned Mm-hmm.

48
00:03:07,101 --> 00:03:09,448
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I started a new work today.

49
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:11,756
Speaker 1: Yeah, Scott's gainfully employed.

50
00:03:11,877 --> 00:03:14,447
Speaker 0: It's a I was Just a month ago.

51
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:17,680
Speaker 0: This isn't in fact, it's more rare for me to not be gainfully.

52
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:19,840
Speaker 1: Yes, but you it has been a change of state.

53
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:24,719
Speaker 1: I mean, it's kind of like Manchester differential where we only update when there is a change.

54
00:03:26,062 --> 00:03:30,506
Speaker 0: You mean like it anyway, it only writes down the changes It doesn't make copies of the whole.

55
00:03:30,526 --> 00:03:33,800
Speaker 1: well actually Manchester differential also has an automatic mid-bit transition.

56
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:38,358
Speaker 1: Technically you have a fake update every second, but then right anyway.

57
00:03:40,381 --> 00:03:45,074
Speaker 0: So, you know, there are things to say about the new work, but you know pertaining to the work itself.

58
00:03:45,135 --> 00:03:46,579
Speaker 0: I can't really say anything.

59
00:03:47,980 --> 00:04:08,600
Speaker 0: But pertaining to the meta of the work You know, they didn't give me too much choice in Machinery, so my choices are pretty much Desktop Dell which was you know, which I would have gone with because I had an Optiplex in my last job and it was fantastic Except for the fact that there might be some working from home action going on.

60
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:20,000
Speaker 0: So it has to be some sort of laptop action right with some sort of docking situation like there was at my two jobs ago You know, so I wanted a Lenovo x300 but that probably wasn't gonna happen.

61
00:04:20,401 --> 00:04:24,513
Speaker 0: So my choices are pretty much like Dell laptop or MacBook, right?

62
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:27,965
Speaker 0: So I'm like, well, you know, whatever It's for work only.

63
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:29,431
Speaker 0: I'm not using it for my shit.

64
00:04:29,571 --> 00:04:33,238
Speaker 0: So as long as it, you know is good for the work It doesn't bother me, you know.

65
00:04:33,922 --> 00:04:40,464
Speaker 0: So the other guy was using the MacBook and apparently the MacBook Pro doesn't come in 13-inch It only comes in 15 or 17.

66
00:04:40,464 --> 00:04:43,596
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I was like well fuck that.

67
00:04:43,757 --> 00:04:47,959
Speaker 0: so I got the 13 You know and I could probably do a whole show.

68
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:54,440
Speaker 0: I just talking about it cuz I've never really used a ma an OS X as a desktop for an extended usage.

69
00:04:54,621 --> 00:05:03,700
Speaker 1: I mean I can say way way back, you know in the kind of early days of geek nights Remember when I still work to that hospital and I bought that Mac mini and I was like, yeah fuck Linux fuck windows.

70
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:09,120
Speaker 1: I'm going Mac and Wallet could not podcast and it could not play games.

71
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:12,810
Speaker 1: It was really pretty and slick for everything else.

72
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,120
Speaker 0: I was yeah, I mean it seems like you know for everything that there is.

73
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,026
Speaker 0: That's bad about it.

74
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,119
Speaker 0: There's something else good like for example, right?

75
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:21,006
Speaker 0: They have done the new ones.

76
00:05:21,046 --> 00:05:22,673
Speaker 0: They got this giant touchpad.

77
00:05:22,734 --> 00:05:24,220
Speaker 0: That is a button, right?

78
00:05:24,885 --> 00:05:26,760
Speaker 0: And there are some things I don't like about it.

79
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:39,985
Speaker 0: Like pushing it in is a little harder than pushing in like a separate button, you know, like on my other my laptop You know, so that's annoying and it doesn't have two buttons, but it does have ways that you can you know Like I set it up.

80
00:05:40,025 --> 00:05:43,280
Speaker 0: So if you push the bottom right corner of it, it is a right button.

81
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,842
Speaker 0: Click you see stuff like that, but for every bad thing like that There's a good thing.

82
00:05:47,902 --> 00:05:53,760
Speaker 0: for example, if you put two fingers on it and slide around you can scroll up and down.

83
00:05:54,802 --> 00:06:00,205
Speaker 0: And if you put four fingers on it, you can do the expose by going up or down, you know I'm gonna follow Luke here.

84
00:06:00,668 --> 00:06:02,840
Speaker 1: There is a sexual joke that could be made.

85
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:03,927
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not going to make.

86
00:06:04,008 --> 00:06:05,860
Speaker 0: there is a lot this you know, so that's pretty cool.

87
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,099
Speaker 1: Yeah, what happens if you do the shocker to it?

88
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:08,971
Speaker 1: I don't know.

89
00:06:09,461 --> 00:06:15,900
Speaker 0: But there are actually little videos in the preferences in the control panel showing you like the control panel for configuring.

90
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,257
Speaker 0: It has video showing you how to use it.

91
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:27,906
Speaker 0: Anyway, the one there is one the one annoyance that is like the annoyance I cannot beat and it is like this incredible Constant annoyance and I want to.

92
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:33,905
Speaker 0: I want to call out and see if anyone can help me with this because it's not the kind Of thing that's easy to search for.

93
00:06:33,986 --> 00:06:36,454
Speaker 1: I swear to God if you say it's a Mac.

94
00:06:36,675 --> 00:06:37,478
Speaker 1: How do I change that?

95
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,342
Speaker 0: No Okay.

96
00:06:39,362 --> 00:06:40,525
Speaker 0: So here's the problem, right?

97
00:06:40,546 --> 00:06:40,826
Speaker 0: All right.

98
00:06:41,027 --> 00:06:42,852
Speaker 0: Okay caps lock key is useless.

99
00:06:42,912 --> 00:06:44,477
Speaker 0: Everyone knows this right.

100
00:06:44,597 --> 00:06:49,608
Speaker 0: if you use caps lock key You're stupid Except for very very rare circumstances.

101
00:06:49,748 --> 00:06:51,374
Speaker 1: simple data entry, right?

102
00:06:51,675 --> 00:07:02,820
Speaker 0: So because it's you know Even though you should you know, you might have an occasional legitimate use for it There's no reason for it to be right there in an incredibly easy to hit position.

103
00:07:03,362 --> 00:07:14,160
Speaker 0: You want the keys you use the most often to be in the incredibly easy to hit positions, you know Right next to your home row, you know, you want the rarely placed keys to be far away.

104
00:07:14,842 --> 00:07:19,920
Speaker 0: So I always and you should do convert caps lock into control.

105
00:07:20,101 --> 00:07:22,411
Speaker 1: I found four programs you can pay for to do that.

106
00:07:22,652 --> 00:07:24,520
Speaker 0: No, no, no, no, no what that's just.

107
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:26,203
Speaker 1: I'm just.

108
00:07:26,303 --> 00:07:26,744
Speaker 1: I just did.

109
00:07:26,945 --> 00:07:34,108
Speaker 0: Uh, anyway, you can turn caps lock into control in the Mac OS X control panel, there's an option.

110
00:07:34,168 --> 00:07:34,489
Speaker 0: I did it.

111
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,171
Speaker 0: Okay.

112
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,077
Speaker 1: All right, obviously, there's something wrong.

113
00:07:37,238 --> 00:07:37,619
Speaker 0: Obviously.

114
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:39,671
Speaker 0: Yes I'm just explaining the situation.

115
00:07:39,691 --> 00:07:40,435
Speaker 0: is it sticky?

116
00:07:40,455 --> 00:07:44,530
Speaker 0: No Get me it's a complicated situation.

117
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,674
Speaker 0: It's not something stupid.

118
00:07:45,734 --> 00:07:46,096
Speaker 0: All right.

119
00:07:46,136 --> 00:07:46,397
Speaker 0: Okay.

120
00:07:46,617 --> 00:08:00,100
Speaker 0: Okay, so In Firefox right on Windows and Linux all the keyboard Shortcuts are like ctrl T for a new tab or ctrl N for a new window or ctrl tab to change tabs, right?

121
00:08:00,765 --> 00:08:01,411
Speaker 0: That's awesome.

122
00:08:01,734 --> 00:08:10,682
Speaker 0: Right in Mac all the keyboard shortcuts in Firefox are command T command tab command N Right.

123
00:08:10,742 --> 00:08:13,313
Speaker 0: replace control with the command key, right?

124
00:08:14,016 --> 00:08:14,760
Speaker 0: Not a big deal.

125
00:08:15,081 --> 00:08:21,017
Speaker 0: So I changed the caps the can caps lock into command instead of changing it into control, right?

126
00:08:21,619 --> 00:08:22,080
Speaker 0: That's cool.

127
00:08:23,023 --> 00:08:30,329
Speaker 0: the problem is on the Mac and say the terminal application or Vim or just about anywhere else.

128
00:08:30,871 --> 00:08:32,155
Speaker 0: It's still control.

129
00:08:32,256 --> 00:08:33,179
Speaker 0: It's not command.

130
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:37,880
Speaker 0: So I have to constantly freaking go into the menu like for Firefox.

131
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:46,165
Speaker 0: I need it to the caps lock key to be command but everywhere else I need the caps lock key to be control and There's no way to do that.

132
00:08:46,265 --> 00:08:49,640
Speaker 0: So either I have to use like this command key.

133
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:55,800
Speaker 0: That's in a weird position for all the Firefox shortcuts or I have to use like the control key.

134
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,520
Speaker 0: That's in a weird position from the everything else shortcut.

135
00:08:58,661 --> 00:09:03,440
Speaker 1: Okay, so I found this farm post or someone has the same quick problem.

136
00:09:04,382 --> 00:09:06,989
Speaker 1: They ask it in a very different way, uh-huh.

137
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:11,621
Speaker 1: I installed Firefox on my Mac my new Mac, by the way It's awesome.

138
00:09:11,721 --> 00:09:12,403
Speaker 1: I really like it.

139
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:17,702
Speaker 1: But for some reason all the control shortcuts don't work Hmm.

140
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,006
Speaker 1: Why can't I hit?

141
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:21,032
Speaker 1: why don't my control something shortcuts work?

142
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:21,875
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

143
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:24,464
Speaker 1: I don't think he realizes Right.

144
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,868
Speaker 0: I knew that they were command.

145
00:09:25,888 --> 00:09:28,516
Speaker 1: I don't think he realizes the first response works.

146
00:09:28,557 --> 00:09:29,219
Speaker 1: fine for me.

147
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,391
Speaker 1: Yes Reply, what are you using?

148
00:09:31,773 --> 00:09:32,820
Speaker 1: reply windows?

149
00:09:34,598 --> 00:09:35,763
Speaker 1: I Don't know.

150
00:09:36,064 --> 00:09:42,709
Speaker 0: did see this wasn't a problem in the living room where we have a Mac already because I only ever used Firefox in the living room.

151
00:09:42,729 --> 00:09:44,240
Speaker 0: I don't use anything else down there.

152
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:49,840
Speaker 0: So turning the caps lock in living room into the command key is great because I never need the control key.

153
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,253
Speaker 0: I don't use anything but Firefox in the living room.

154
00:09:52,515 --> 00:09:59,179
Speaker 0: I don't use the terminal I don't and the worst right is that I've got parallels with Ubuntu and Windows running in it.

155
00:10:00,302 --> 00:10:02,889
Speaker 0: Right, so what I'm what I'm focused on?

156
00:10:02,929 --> 00:10:13,380
Speaker 0: like this virtual machine running Ubuntu and I've got a terminal and I want to push ctrl L to clear the terminal right or ctrl T to open a tab in the Firefox in the virtual machine.

157
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:15,519
Speaker 0: I got this command key there.

158
00:10:16,342 --> 00:10:25,040
Speaker 0: So I think the optimal solution would be to set the key to be control because in everything but Firefox I want it to be control, right?

159
00:10:25,361 --> 00:10:35,700
Speaker 0: So then wouldn't just I need to find I need to find some way to Screw with a Mac Firefox so that control works instead of command for all the shortcuts.

160
00:10:36,162 --> 00:10:42,006
Speaker 0: So if anyone knows how to do that, or if anyone knows of any other solution to this problem I need this.

161
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:44,319
Speaker 0: this is like a serious problem here.

162
00:10:45,843 --> 00:10:46,346
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're right.

163
00:10:46,366 --> 00:10:47,876
Speaker 1: That's kind of hard to Google for.

164
00:10:48,138 --> 00:10:49,024
Speaker 0: yeah How do I change?

165
00:10:51,624 --> 00:10:52,159
Speaker 1: Control?

166
00:10:53,241 --> 00:10:58,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, how to modify Mac Firefox keyboard shortcuts from command to control?

167
00:10:58,921 --> 00:11:01,580
Speaker 0: I don't think that's gonna come up with the right answer.

168
00:11:02,122 --> 00:11:05,775
Speaker 1: I'm kind of curious too because that would I would run into this problem if I tried.

169
00:11:05,835 --> 00:11:09,487
Speaker 0: it's it's incredibly frustrating You know, especially since right?

170
00:11:09,868 --> 00:11:18,420
Speaker 0: I mean while this is gonna be my work computer and Hours wise I will spend more time using it than other computers.

171
00:11:19,143 --> 00:11:23,300
Speaker 0: I still use Windows and Linux just about everywhere and I've got this virtual machine and you know.

172
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:33,215
Speaker 0: So I'm not really, you know while I'm using a Mac hardware machine like, you know, eight hours a day at least probably You know for the you know foreseeable future.

173
00:11:33,235 --> 00:12:00,360
Speaker 0: I You know, I'm not really using Mac OS, you know that many hours and So I getting used to like using the command key instead of the control key is probably just gonna be incredibly frustrating Because I'd have to keep switching back and forth, you know I've sort of unified the keyboard shortcuts across everything because I'm using you know Vim and the terminal and Firefox everywhere and they're all the same shortcuts except on the stupid Mac where it's a different shortcut.

174
00:12:00,462 --> 00:12:00,935
Speaker 0: It's like die.

175
00:12:02,442 --> 00:12:03,548
Speaker 0: So that's help me out.

176
00:12:04,192 --> 00:12:05,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, so my pinky doesn't break off.

177
00:12:07,162 --> 00:12:11,318
Speaker 1: We won't give you anything other than fame and Internet glory, but that's it.

178
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:13,149
Speaker 1: So you got any I don't know.

179
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:17,851
Speaker 1: tech news a tech news Well speaking of I got a bunch of little stuff.

180
00:12:18,273 --> 00:12:20,140
Speaker 0: well speaking of the the apples, right?

181
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:29,715
Speaker 0: There are some stories going around relatively recently less than a week ago that Well, actually it's sort of like there were murmurs way back like months ago.

182
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,320
Speaker 0: And now there's more murmurs, right?

183
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:43,460
Speaker 0: The murmur way back was that Apple bought like these chip making chip designing companies like companies that design microchips Right and more recently they've started to hire, you know microchip designer people.

184
00:12:44,103 --> 00:12:46,859
Speaker 0: So everyone's like Apple's gonna make their own chips, you know.

185
00:12:47,782 --> 00:12:50,912
Speaker 0: And the murmurs that are going around are ludicrous.

186
00:12:51,212 --> 00:13:06,780
Speaker 0: I say cuz what people are saying is like Apple's gonna make you know their own CPUs instead of using Intel that way, you know You can't install OS X on fucking anything But Apple hardware because Apple hard will be the only way to get Apple chips and that's gonna be it.

187
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,726
Speaker 1: No, they don't even need that.

188
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:25,220
Speaker 0: while Apple would probably like the DRM aspect of that There is no way that any chip Apple can design is ever ever ever going to Match with Intel or Nvidia in the performance power usage efficiency departments.

189
00:13:25,783 --> 00:13:29,640
Speaker 0: It would cost so much money and require so much talent.

190
00:13:30,022 --> 00:13:33,400
Speaker 0: There is absolutely no way they can ever catch up to that right, you know, it's kind of sad.

191
00:13:33,501 --> 00:13:37,323
Speaker 1: I used to work in a place where I could find out more about this But yeah, I don't.

192
00:13:37,363 --> 00:13:49,620
Speaker 0: but what Apple is doing I can almost guarantee is they're looking for ways To develop more specialized chips for the smaller devices, you know, that's actually what I was just about to suggest.

193
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,339
Speaker 1: It's also a way to really really reduce the cost of production for things like iPod.

194
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,791
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it's not necessarily the CPUs either right?

195
00:13:57,871 --> 00:13:59,276
Speaker 0: I mean look at an iPod.

196
00:13:59,337 --> 00:14:02,730
Speaker 0: right in an iPod You have all different functionality, right?

197
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:13,633
Speaker 0: You need a display chip for the screen You need audio processing for the output, you know hole to your headphones You need input processing because they all iPods all have.

198
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:14,576
Speaker 0: you know audio input.

199
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:22,899
Speaker 0: you need, you know I guess some sort of I/O chip for you know, the buttons I guess and stuff like that, right and you know You only need certain functions, right?

200
00:14:23,681 --> 00:14:27,236
Speaker 0: So you can you know put a CPU in the iPod, right.

201
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:30,659
Speaker 0: and then you know Put some software and some firmware on there and you're good to go.

202
00:14:31,243 --> 00:14:44,797
Speaker 0: But if you can somehow manage to make a chip You know that in hardware does the things the iPod does and doesn't do anything else and is incredibly Specialized to those functions, you know mp3 decoding video decoding, etc.

203
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:44,998
Speaker 0: Etc.

204
00:14:45,038 --> 00:14:45,138
Speaker 0: Etc.

205
00:14:46,683 --> 00:14:49,460
Speaker 0: You can make the iPod a fuck lot smaller.

206
00:14:50,761 --> 00:14:56,619
Speaker 1: I don't think miniaturization itself is gonna be the concern because if you I mean if you actually touched the newest shuffle.

207
00:14:57,545 --> 00:15:06,040
Speaker 0: Well, they're not snow not just smaller But also more efficient in the electricity and battery life and I think we're pretty much every department.

208
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:08,740
Speaker 1: I think we're gonna see a lot more battery life if they make their own gym.

209
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,870
Speaker 1: Yes, the iPhone battery life, you know, it's the other thing, you know I did see a lot of rumors about.

210
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,920
Speaker 1: you know, where is Apple gonna build their fab?

211
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:24,000
Speaker 1: They're very clearly going to whatever and I don't know what company they'll go with but they might design a chip But then they'll send it to someone like Charlie.

212
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,029
Speaker 0: Yeah, almost nobody owns fabs.

213
00:15:28,491 --> 00:15:34,694
Speaker 0: almost everyone who designs chips sends them to a fab Puts an order in and gets the chips back in the mail.

214
00:15:34,774 --> 00:15:35,980
Speaker 0: That's that's how it works.

215
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:41,380
Speaker 0: I mean, I mean all the iPods are what they're built by like Foxconn or some, you know, Chinese place, right?

216
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:46,380
Speaker 0: But if you buy an Apple product, it says designed by Apple in California made in China.

217
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:50,280
Speaker 1: Well, like as I recall remember the the cell processor the ps3 the IBM baby.

218
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:54,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was made by IBM, but it was also made by chartered and all these other people.

219
00:15:54,542 --> 00:15:59,451
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you know this fabs all over Taiwan Southeast Asia in the u.s.

220
00:15:59,471 --> 00:16:09,940
Speaker 0: This fab some of them not that The biggest fabs in the country is right down the road from us used to work at it But there's you know, there's lots of fabs around and very few company.

221
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,699
Speaker 0: There's a lot more companies designing chips than you know, actually making them.

222
00:16:14,163 --> 00:16:16,340
Speaker 0: I mean, it's the same thing with electronics in general, right?

223
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:22,300
Speaker 0: I mean a lot of people design gadgets, but they don't own a gadget factory, right?

224
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:28,520
Speaker 0: I mean just because you design gadgets and sell gadgets with your brand name on them doesn't mean you own a gadget factory.

225
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:32,423
Speaker 0: You probably just pay someone else to use their gadget factory Usually China.

226
00:16:32,764 --> 00:16:43,640
Speaker 1: more to the point if they actually are going to be designing chips and you know those these rumors are going around We're not going to see any products using these chips for years at least because the does the process of making a chip.

227
00:16:43,801 --> 00:16:44,243
Speaker 0: Well, they did.

228
00:16:44,263 --> 00:16:47,600
Speaker 0: they bought a company that already had a bunch of work done and now they hired people.

229
00:16:47,982 --> 00:16:49,251
Speaker 0: So they're probably well on their way.

230
00:16:49,272 --> 00:16:51,584
Speaker 0: I think within a year or two You'll see the problem.

231
00:16:51,785 --> 00:16:56,180
Speaker 1: maybe because the once the chip is designed like you've got a solid design down.

232
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,719
Speaker 1: That's when all the problems actually begin because that's when you do like the test runs you have.

233
00:17:00,739 --> 00:17:03,636
Speaker 1: you know The really poor yields you have to go through this specialized kind of.

234
00:17:04,098 --> 00:17:04,962
Speaker 0: yeah But they're not doing.

235
00:17:05,022 --> 00:17:07,771
Speaker 0: yeah, but the chips that they're probably making right are.

236
00:17:07,811 --> 00:17:10,079
Speaker 0: they're not making like these high-performance CPUs.

237
00:17:10,201 --> 00:17:13,040
Speaker 0: They're making like, you know chips that are much simpler.

238
00:17:13,354 --> 00:17:20,940
Speaker 1: No But if they're making simpler chips or they're using commodity Manufacturing methods then they're not gonna get that much benefit because they probably can't get much more.

239
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,119
Speaker 0: I mean, they're gonna use modern manufacturing methods, but they're gonna make like, you know an mp3 decoder chip.

240
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,910
Speaker 0: You know that has some other stuff on it.

241
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,720
Speaker 0: It's not, you know, too complicated.

242
00:17:29,901 --> 00:17:37,404
Speaker 0: So it's you know, it's it's gonna be a lot less difficult than if you were gonna make, you know From actual manufacturing.

243
00:17:37,484 --> 00:17:47,280
Speaker 1: it's an incredibly complicated process and the real issue is that if you make anything new it Takes ages to figure out how to make it efficiently enough for it not to just lose money.

244
00:17:48,181 --> 00:17:50,428
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you're not making it, you know, calm.

245
00:17:50,488 --> 00:17:52,795
Speaker 0: It's not like, you know a core to do.

246
00:17:52,876 --> 00:17:55,219
Speaker 0: All right, it's it's you know It's an iPod chip.

247
00:17:57,563 --> 00:18:04,110
Speaker 1: What I'm saying is that if they use kind of the tried-and-true Manufacturing methods such that they could start rolling this out more quickly.

248
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:04,973
Speaker 1: Then there are.

249
00:18:05,013 --> 00:18:11,413
Speaker 1: they very likely can't do anything Particularly advanced and as in I don't see them doing anything.

250
00:18:11,433 --> 00:18:13,160
Speaker 1: That would be a noticeable improvement.

251
00:18:13,381 --> 00:18:20,120
Speaker 0: Well, it's a noticeable improvement because what they'll be doing is what Apple has always done right ever since the Apple - which was come.

252
00:18:20,241 --> 00:18:22,959
Speaker 0: Right now, you know, the iPod will have three chips in it.

253
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:30,413
Speaker 0: In the next iPod will have one that does the work of all those three, you know That's that's really all Steve Wozniak did on the original Apple was.

254
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:37,440
Speaker 0: he just looked at existing computers And he said and there are all these new chips coming out all the time that you can get in Radio Shack or wherever.

255
00:18:37,922 --> 00:18:41,700
Speaker 0: And he's like, hey this new chip that just came out does the work of those three chips.

256
00:18:42,001 --> 00:18:46,500
Speaker 0: And he just kept doing that over and over again and the result was the first Apple computer.

257
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,215
Speaker 0: So I think that you know, there aren't these new chips coming out.

258
00:18:50,255 --> 00:19:00,751
Speaker 0: that does the work of you know The three anymore at least not as rapidly because people have sort of settled into just getting a CPU and doing everything in software With very few specialized hardware chips.

259
00:19:01,393 --> 00:19:10,060
Speaker 0: So what they're gonna do is they're gonna do it Steve Wozniak did way back in the early 80s is You know make a chip that does the work of three or four chips that are already in the iPod.

260
00:19:10,241 --> 00:19:16,860
Speaker 1: I guess if they're gonna if they do something like that I don't think we're actually gonna see any major improvements in their technology.

261
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:22,092
Speaker 1: All we're gonna see is they charge the same amount of money for the iPod But it cost them a lot less to make it.

262
00:19:22,253 --> 00:19:23,159
Speaker 0: they could be that too.

263
00:19:23,582 --> 00:19:29,730
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure that they're pretty much by making their own chips They're pretty much getting all of the benefits that we have described.

264
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:33,040
Speaker 0: at the only cost to them is the cost of designing the chips.

265
00:19:33,321 --> 00:19:41,198
Speaker 1: Well, you know, this is kind of the common thing for any time the economy is slow Especially now where Apple, you know their sales in a recession and this sort of thing people won't buy.

266
00:19:41,218 --> 00:19:44,570
Speaker 0: the $400 I think is Apple's doing better than they are.

267
00:19:44,691 --> 00:19:49,754
Speaker 1: but but now is the time to invest in R&D Especially when it's cheaper to get our and absolutely is.

268
00:19:49,774 --> 00:19:50,900
Speaker 0: this is the R&D time.

269
00:19:51,061 --> 00:19:51,342
Speaker 0: Yes,

270
00:19:51,643 --> 00:20:07,395
Speaker 1: so Apple's looking forward and I'll bet they're just trying to lower their costs and I don't think Anything of note is going to come of this Except for the fact that Apple profits will increase in the long run at least for two years and maybe after that time They might have some sort of advanced chip that does something cool.

271
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,644
Speaker 0: Hmm Plus, you know any?

272
00:20:10,286 --> 00:20:14,579
Speaker 0: you know when they do make the like these chips, you know, they don't really advertise like.

273
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:16,800
Speaker 0: hey This is what chips are in the iPod, right?

274
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:24,596
Speaker 0: You're only gonna find out like if they've done something like after in gadget busts an iPod open and says hey There's only like one chip in this thing.

275
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:25,080
Speaker 0: What the fuck?

276
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,367
Speaker 1: Well, see that's the initial stage.

277
00:20:26,428 --> 00:20:33,380
Speaker 1: my bet stage one is just you know Have a cheaper manufacturing process sell the $400 iPods, but make a lot more money off of them.

278
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,463
Speaker 0: Which is that'd be funny.

279
00:20:34,563 --> 00:20:42,175
Speaker 0: open up an iPod and it's literally a headphone jack a screen a chip a battery and a flash Thing and that's it.

280
00:20:43,102 --> 00:20:53,613
Speaker 1: But then maybe if I were Apple my long-term strategy would be that two three years from now I Suddenly have you know, the Intel brand a little logo the AMD little logo.

281
00:20:53,633 --> 00:20:55,520
Speaker 1: I would have the Apple chip logo.

282
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:56,639
Speaker 1: I'd call it something cool.

283
00:20:57,062 --> 00:21:01,299
Speaker 1: I would put that sticker on all the stuff that used it and just charge twice as much for those things.

284
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:04,690
Speaker 1: Not bad regardless of whether or not the chip was actually different.

285
00:21:05,292 --> 00:21:05,693
Speaker 0: Mmm.

286
00:21:06,536 --> 00:21:07,860
Speaker 1: I can't rely on Apple too much though.

287
00:21:08,861 --> 00:21:11,030
Speaker 0: Someone else also said that you know make is like.

288
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:16,069
Speaker 0: right now a lot of the chips in the Apple Products are made by you know competitors.

289
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:20,185
Speaker 0: Like I think like Samsung makes them like flash that they use It's like.

290
00:21:20,306 --> 00:21:22,380
Speaker 0: but Samsung also makes mp3 players.

291
00:21:22,921 --> 00:21:30,240
Speaker 0: So by making their own chips, maybe even making their own flash and you know and such they can avoid some of that.

292
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:42,779
Speaker 0: you know conflict of interest in that department and also, you know, sometimes Apple like wants to order stuff and You know, they're sort of held back and their supplies are limited or whatever because you know, people can't keep up.

293
00:21:43,181 --> 00:21:45,429
Speaker 1: Well, it's not just maybe but it did the.

294
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:53,984
Speaker 1: there are two basic paradigms of manufacturing for chips And this applies generally to industrial stuff not just chips thing, you know flash and other parts Like I just said.

295
00:21:54,004 --> 00:21:57,340
Speaker 1: this also applies broadly to general industrial manufacturing.

296
00:21:58,105 --> 00:22:17,817
Speaker 1: but there's either the kind of Commodity you create a whole bunch stored in warehouses and ship it out or the so-called Just-in-time manufacturing where you are manufacturing things to be shipped directly to the people who use them and you never carry an inventory which of Course is much higher risk for the people downstream much lower risk for the people upstream.

297
00:22:18,258 --> 00:22:24,000
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Yeah, I think you know Apple might be doing something there to you know help its flow.

298
00:22:24,361 --> 00:22:36,760
Speaker 1: but speaking of a conflict of interest remember way back we I forget what show it was but we talked a lot about how Cabled providers are in this conundrum where on one hand they provide TV and on the other hand they provide internet.

299
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:43,920
Speaker 1: So they have this automatic conflict of interest between two competing media that they have an interest in both of them.

300
00:22:44,261 --> 00:22:44,964
Speaker 1: You know, what do they do?

301
00:22:44,984 --> 00:22:49,400
Speaker 1: They're kind of screwing water screwing the other and they're working to the contrary aims of all the consumers.

302
00:22:49,521 --> 00:22:56,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like if you were simultaneously I don't know an ISP and a newspaper at the same time.

303
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:04,860
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, how well by letting people go to news.google.com We're also making our newspaper business go down.

304
00:23:05,121 --> 00:23:10,460
Speaker 1: Well, there's an article on slash shot talking about just that before so we broke the news first.

305
00:23:11,243 --> 00:23:12,869
Speaker 1: I think everyone smart already realized that.

306
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:15,378
Speaker 1: but it is an interesting article because they the.

307
00:23:16,121 --> 00:23:34,140
Speaker 1: The supposition here is that cable networks that are also is PS most of their infrastructure costs and most of the money and Expenses that are that are happening now that are causing them to say oh we need to raise prices are from HD TV Content and have nothing to do with their ISP internet side.

308
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,995
Speaker 0: Well, but I thought that you know TV like cable TV, you know doesn't use the same.

309
00:23:39,035 --> 00:23:40,118
Speaker 0: I mean it uses bandwidth.

310
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:44,773
Speaker 0: obviously That's you know technological reality, but it's not IP bandwidth.

311
00:23:44,853 --> 00:23:46,257
Speaker 0: It's you know broadcast it out.

312
00:23:46,337 --> 00:23:47,902
Speaker 0: It's not packet So it's got.

313
00:23:47,922 --> 00:24:04,399
Speaker 1: but so I said infrastructures the infrastructure and cost on the back end of distributing this high-definition signal all this Data everywhere storing it relaying it Uh-huh, keeping up with it Don't forget all the licensing fees and the the complicated relationship of how our cable network gets television and then gives it to you

314
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:04,922
Speaker 0: Yep.

315
00:24:04,962 --> 00:24:05,203
Speaker 0: Yep.

316
00:24:05,223 --> 00:24:05,424
Speaker 0: Yep.

317
00:24:06,026 --> 00:24:09,240
Speaker 0: Well, then again, not all is PS are also cable companies.

318
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:19,740
Speaker 0: You know, some of the ones are you know that are you know, sort of hurting net neutrality are not all you know cable They're you know, giving you, you know t1s and DSLs and phone companies and shit like that.

319
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,225
Speaker 1: Well, they're talking just about cable.

320
00:24:21,486 --> 00:24:21,727
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

321
00:24:21,928 --> 00:24:22,229
Speaker 0: All right.

322
00:24:23,032 --> 00:24:23,915
Speaker 1: It's an interesting article.

323
00:24:23,955 --> 00:24:24,919
Speaker 1: I recommend everyone read it.

324
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,283
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it is.

325
00:24:26,303 --> 00:24:40,900
Speaker 0: it is sort of true that you know you look and you know cable channels do use bandwidth And if they remove say a cable channel, they could fill that space Theoretically, you know with packets instead, you know, they could do that.

326
00:24:41,101 --> 00:24:45,478
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's more that there's gonna be a lot of pressure and a lot of people are supposing this.

327
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:53,525
Speaker 1: at least You don't remember the whole a la carte cable pricing thing the thing that the that FCC supposedly demanded but never happened.

328
00:24:54,287 --> 00:24:57,696
Speaker 1: if that actually happens that might just be the absolute end of TV.

329
00:24:57,836 --> 00:25:08,080
Speaker 1: because think about this that Like the domino effect would be massive because you've got a lot of TV channels like sippy That no one would actually pay for in enough quantity.

330
00:25:08,123 --> 00:25:20,409
Speaker 0: Yeah if you get if I gave you a list of every cable channel there that exists in the entire world and You would circle the ones you're willing to pay for and the more you circle the more you pay How many are you gonna circle?

331
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:21,252
Speaker 0: I would circle.

332
00:25:21,292 --> 00:25:24,477
Speaker 1: imagine cable TV would become ESPN TV.

333
00:25:25,121 --> 00:25:31,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would circle pretty much any live sports network that carries a New York team that I care about right?

334
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,852
Speaker 0: I would circle one of the mate one of each of the major networks just because You know Cartoon Network ain't what it used to be.

335
00:25:37,892 --> 00:25:39,380
Speaker 0: So fuck them, right?

336
00:25:40,945 --> 00:25:41,369
Speaker 0: I don't know what.

337
00:25:41,389 --> 00:25:42,299
Speaker 0: I circle anything else.

338
00:25:43,285 --> 00:25:43,989
Speaker 1: What about sippy?

339
00:25:44,653 --> 00:25:45,176
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

340
00:25:47,582 --> 00:25:49,308
Speaker 1: What about the anime network?

341
00:25:49,328 --> 00:25:49,930
Speaker 1: does that even still?

342
00:25:49,971 --> 00:25:51,777
Speaker 0: that's an on-demand thing and it sucks.

343
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:53,786
Speaker 1: Yeah, it does suck I just point out.

344
00:25:54,047 --> 00:25:54,369
Speaker 0: I don't know.

345
00:25:54,389 --> 00:25:55,394
Speaker 0: What else would I circle?

346
00:25:55,414 --> 00:25:57,202
Speaker 0: I Don't know.

347
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:02,380
Speaker 1: What would you circle thing is if if the internet provided live sports for free?

348
00:26:02,741 --> 00:26:04,165
Speaker 0: I don't even need all live sports.

349
00:26:04,245 --> 00:26:09,100
Speaker 0: I just need you know, the incredibly major live sports that I just need hockey.

350
00:26:10,052 --> 00:26:14,100
Speaker 1: All I need is I'm willing to pay a lot of money to just get hockey on my computer.

351
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,534
Speaker 0: You can you can pay you can but it's they black out New York, which you don't care about.

352
00:26:18,614 --> 00:26:19,818
Speaker 1: So I kind of care.

353
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:22,444
Speaker 0: well Because that's the thing.

354
00:26:22,504 --> 00:26:23,708
Speaker 0: It's like the baseball.

355
00:26:23,728 --> 00:26:24,450
Speaker 0: look at this, right?

356
00:26:24,832 --> 00:26:27,320
Speaker 0: You can go to MLB TV baseball, right?

357
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:33,199
Speaker 0: You can pay like a lot of money to get the audio of all baseball games live, right?

358
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:36,779
Speaker 0: But they black out your local teams.

359
00:26:37,422 --> 00:26:43,680
Speaker 0: But with an iPhone you can pay ten bucks a year and get the audio live of all games including your local teams.

360
00:26:45,101 --> 00:26:45,763
Speaker 0: So what the fuck?

361
00:26:46,706 --> 00:26:48,712
Speaker 0: it's from the same company Major League Baseball.

362
00:26:48,752 --> 00:26:49,975
Speaker 0: It's not like a different company.

363
00:26:49,995 --> 00:26:51,179
Speaker 0: It's the same people.

364
00:26:52,183 --> 00:26:56,020
Speaker 1: See, I don't know what sports is thinking because they haven't embraced the internet yet.

365
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,350
Speaker 1: But at the same time I feel like they could make a lot more.

366
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:00,780
Speaker 0: It's like they've been there have done internet stuff.

367
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:06,540
Speaker 0: I mean they put Sunday Night Football live streaming on NBC sports.com last year, but they haven't gone all the way.

368
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,504
Speaker 0: They haven't gone all the way.

369
00:27:07,524 --> 00:27:12,404
Speaker 0: I mean like the Masters golf tournament was partially on Streaming live.

370
00:27:12,444 --> 00:27:19,440
Speaker 1: it's like you could watch like oh my god the stupid masters killed because you know We only we have like these three t1s for like useless internet.

371
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,510
Speaker 1: So everyone was watching the master route anything that doesn't matter.

372
00:27:22,611 --> 00:27:28,133
Speaker 1: over these three t1s and during the stupid masters They were completely utilized for the entirety.

373
00:27:28,193 --> 00:27:28,856
Speaker 0: Everyone wants to tie.

374
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:29,600
Speaker 0: watch Tiger Woods.

375
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,685
Speaker 0: I mean even me.

376
00:27:30,806 --> 00:27:33,760
Speaker 0: I don't care about golf, but it's like you see Tiger Woods.

377
00:27:34,462 --> 00:27:38,660
Speaker 1: But plus look if I can watch that different sports have embraced it to different degrees, too.

378
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,614
Speaker 1: And it's it's this complicated give-and-take, but and see double-a basketball.

379
00:27:42,634 --> 00:27:44,200
Speaker 0: They put the whole tournament live streaming.

380
00:27:44,381 --> 00:27:53,860
Speaker 1: I think the bellwether is going to if we start seeing a shift toward Ubiquitous sports coverage that is easy for people to get to and not too expensive on the internet.

381
00:27:53,981 --> 00:27:55,492
Speaker 0: It makes sports a lot more popular.

382
00:27:55,896 --> 00:28:02,420
Speaker 1: more to the point I think a lot of sub popular sports know them the less, you know, like hockey and f1 and all those things.

383
00:28:02,761 --> 00:28:05,153
Speaker 0: Oh f1 f1 is streaming on the internets.

384
00:28:05,676 --> 00:28:06,319
Speaker 0: Oh my gosh.

385
00:28:06,681 --> 00:28:12,137
Speaker 1: Not only would they get a big boost, but I think that is the canary for the absolute end of broadcast television.

386
00:28:12,418 --> 00:28:14,203
Speaker 0: Oh, definitely Absolutely, like.

387
00:28:14,243 --> 00:28:17,090
Speaker 1: I think that would just destroy it because everyone wants a CSPN.

388
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:19,918
Speaker 0: the thing is the one thing about sports though, right?

389
00:28:20,419 --> 00:28:20,720
Speaker 0: Is that?

390
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:31,495
Speaker 0: simultaneously with what we just said Sports are like the only thing that really needs to be in HD Like the difference between HD hockey and non HD hockey.

391
00:28:31,516 --> 00:28:39,000
Speaker 0: if you if you look I mean Normally like people look at like an HD movie in a non HD movie and they're like think sometimes they can't even tell the difference.

392
00:28:39,442 --> 00:28:45,388
Speaker 0: But in HD hockey, you can see more of the ice You can eat it's easier to see the puck.

393
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:49,300
Speaker 0: There is a dramatic difference like ludicrously dramatic.

394
00:28:49,982 --> 00:28:58,972
Speaker 0: So if you want to put it over the Internet's, you know with a packet switched You know type of situation rather than a cables kind of situation.

395
00:28:59,473 --> 00:29:01,238
Speaker 0: You're using even more bandwidth.

396
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:03,958
Speaker 0: So You know for the HD.

397
00:29:04,765 --> 00:29:05,108
Speaker 1: so see.

398
00:29:05,128 --> 00:29:17,480
Speaker 1: at the same time if There were some sort of course cable TV could benefit from this if they use IP v6 into the multicast Even with if we just used a multicast type of infrastructure To stream live media.

399
00:29:18,126 --> 00:29:24,462
Speaker 1: Because the live stream, you know The everyone watching it at once is the only real bandwidth problem We have left.

400
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:33,618
Speaker 1: if it's not a live stream if it's just you know, after the fact time shifted anything like that Peer-to-peer torrent style media distribution works beautifully.

401
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:37,336
Speaker 1: Yep The only thing that doesn't handle is a live stream and multicast handles that perfectly.

402
00:29:37,357 --> 00:29:40,749
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm You can just assume that everyone no one uses multicast.

403
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:43,278
Speaker 1: Well multicast is very difficult to use.

404
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:51,082
Speaker 0: Yes We should do a show on multicast technology, that's good because I don't only know, you know, the surface level things I've learned.

405
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:55,196
Speaker 1: we use it extensively at work and I I thought I knew a lot about it and I did.

406
00:29:55,578 --> 00:29:56,742
Speaker 1: but I've learned a Lot more.

407
00:29:56,922 --> 00:29:57,504
Speaker 1: that's good.

408
00:29:58,146 --> 00:29:59,611
Speaker 0: Yeah Postgres is hard by the way.

409
00:29:59,872 --> 00:30:01,096
Speaker 1: Yeah hard, but awesome.

410
00:30:01,256 --> 00:30:02,200
Speaker 0: Well, it's also very hard.

411
00:30:08,924 --> 00:30:13,408
Speaker 1: But speaking of hard things of the day Oh Thing of the day you got a thing of the day.

412
00:30:13,589 --> 00:30:15,319
Speaker 0: Well, do you remember a while ago?

413
00:30:15,821 --> 00:30:17,927
Speaker 0: There was this manga guide to databases.

414
00:30:18,489 --> 00:30:23,910
Speaker 1: I do in fact, it was on slash dot or recently again real again There was something to it.

415
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:31,980
Speaker 0: I saw it just a little while ago to remind It's been around for a few months now But it's um, basically someone made a little manga book and it was a guide to databases.

416
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:35,812
Speaker 0: so as an educational manga about Databases and it was cute.

417
00:30:36,859 --> 00:30:40,392
Speaker 0: I discovered something called Ubuntu.

418
00:30:40,412 --> 00:30:46,258
Speaker 0: it is a manga guide to Ubuntu Ubuntu.

419
00:30:47,101 --> 00:30:48,506
Speaker 0: So, how can that not be?

420
00:30:48,827 --> 00:30:51,034
Speaker 0: how can that not be the thing of the day?

421
00:30:51,135 --> 00:30:55,560
Speaker 0: Wow, there's an inside joke that disappeared I know right and the thing is I'm looking at like the arts.

422
00:30:56,281 --> 00:31:07,120
Speaker 0: Pretty good for something that it's like educational whatever and it was, you know Originally done in Japanese for Japanese people and is now translated to English and it's like totally awesome.

423
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:08,588
Speaker 1: I think there's a big market for this.

424
00:31:08,608 --> 00:31:10,660
Speaker 0: I hope there's a lot of Japanese people use Ubuntu.

425
00:31:11,222 --> 00:31:15,379
Speaker 1: I hope artists get together with their tech friends and make more stuff like this.

426
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:24,265
Speaker 0: It's funny because I'm looking at this drawing of like some girls sitting at a desk with the computer and she sort of got this like Look and like.

427
00:31:24,325 --> 00:31:34,003
Speaker 0: if you look at the her speech, it's all like, you know Japanese characters, but there's words like gooey Unixer Windows OS Slackware.

428
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:35,738
Speaker 0: open Solaris question mark.

429
00:31:37,266 --> 00:31:40,283
Speaker 0: It's kind of funny By the way.

430
00:31:40,424 --> 00:31:42,253
Speaker 0: open Solaris while I don't really.

431
00:31:42,273 --> 00:31:47,731
Speaker 0: I mean Solaris is good for stuff But the main thing going on right now with open Solaris is they have.

432
00:31:47,771 --> 00:31:52,829
Speaker 0: ZFS is by default and ZFS is like the best file System to ever exist in the history of the universe.

433
00:31:53,391 --> 00:31:58,600
Speaker 0: and if you're running like a NAS or something Open Solaris is the win for the file servers right now.

434
00:32:00,722 --> 00:32:01,184
Speaker 1: So I'm not.

435
00:32:01,224 --> 00:32:04,418
Speaker 1: this isn't my thing of the day, but I just have to point it out on CollegeHumor.

436
00:32:04,438 --> 00:32:10,300
Speaker 1: right now There's a CollegeHumor tribute to Guy Ritchie and if you don't know who that is just go to CollegeHumor and find the video.

437
00:32:11,502 --> 00:32:24,943
Speaker 1: But no my thing of the day is that there was a man in Texas Bill Waters who for whatever reason he bought this old ledger book and he's flipping through it and it was from some pharmacy somewhere and Inside of it.

438
00:32:25,364 --> 00:32:30,160
Speaker 1: It happened to have these interesting old formulas for a whole bunch of weird stuff.

439
00:32:30,968 --> 00:32:33,067
Speaker 1: One of them was entitled Dr.

440
00:32:33,108 --> 00:32:35,862
Speaker 1: Pepper's peps and bitters Mm-hmm.

441
00:32:36,022 --> 00:32:39,293
Speaker 1: He may or may not have found one of the original formulas for either.

442
00:32:39,353 --> 00:32:39,674
Speaker 1: Dr.

443
00:32:39,715 --> 00:32:41,785
Speaker 1: Pepper or a Dr.

444
00:32:41,866 --> 00:32:44,221
Speaker 1: Pepper derived Digestive.

445
00:32:45,043 --> 00:32:46,568
Speaker 0: Well, you don't want the second one.

446
00:32:46,829 --> 00:32:47,972
Speaker 1: You might you might.

447
00:32:48,815 --> 00:32:54,083
Speaker 0: I think we have better digestives nowadays than they did in the olden days But I recommend.

448
00:32:54,103 --> 00:33:00,322
Speaker 1: this is an interesting article because a lot of people don't realize that like the formula for coca-cola Dr.

449
00:33:00,362 --> 00:33:04,919
Speaker 1: Pepper or any of these kind of old soft drinks and even a lot of new food are not patented.

450
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:13,380
Speaker 1: and The reason they're not patented because it's when you apply for a patent You have to say what you're doing and give it to the world and then when the patent expires, it's free reign.

451
00:33:13,621 --> 00:33:16,089
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that's the thing the difference between a patent and a copyright.

452
00:33:16,109 --> 00:33:17,553
Speaker 0: at least practically speaking.

453
00:33:17,614 --> 00:33:19,620
Speaker 0: right you copyright something.

454
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,205
Speaker 0: Well, there's also trade seeker right?

455
00:33:21,225 --> 00:33:25,037
Speaker 0: So trade secret is where you don't tell anybody anything.

456
00:33:25,077 --> 00:33:26,670
Speaker 0: You don't copyright it You don't patent it.

457
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:27,299
Speaker 0: You don't do shit.

458
00:33:27,701 --> 00:33:28,845
Speaker 0: You just keep it a secret.

459
00:33:29,247 --> 00:33:32,620
Speaker 0: and if anyone steals the secret you can be like, hey, they stole our secret, right?

460
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:33,560
Speaker 0: Patent.

461
00:33:33,621 --> 00:33:36,008
Speaker 0: when you patent something you say I invented this.

462
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:37,653
Speaker 0: here are diagrams of it.

463
00:33:37,713 --> 00:33:38,896
Speaker 0: Here's descriptions of it.

464
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:40,160
Speaker 0: Here's the whole thing.

465
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,040
Speaker 0: Here's my invention.

466
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:46,440
Speaker 0: You show it to the government and the government shows it to the whole world and everyone can look it up in the patent database.

467
00:33:46,921 --> 00:33:50,051
Speaker 0: But everyone can see it, but no one's allowed to copy it.

468
00:33:50,071 --> 00:33:50,673
Speaker 0: for what?

469
00:33:50,673 --> 00:33:50,954
Speaker 0: 14 years.

470
00:33:50,974 --> 00:33:53,040
Speaker 0: I think some number of years.

471
00:33:53,141 --> 00:33:55,313
Speaker 0: No one can copy it, but everyone can see it.

472
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:58,145
Speaker 0: But when the years run out Everyone can copy it.

473
00:33:58,646 --> 00:34:03,040
Speaker 0: That's what a patent does and a copyright while we all know what a copyright does.

474
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,779
Speaker 0: So, you know, they patented a lot of these things back in the day.

475
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:15,385
Speaker 0: so any old inventions you can copy but usually you don't want to copy an old invention unless you're steampunk in it because You got something better.

476
00:34:15,445 --> 00:34:20,587
Speaker 0: nowadays, you know who wants to copy, you know an apple - unless you you know Really want to make one?

477
00:34:20,627 --> 00:34:22,139
Speaker 1: Well plus I mean think I'm back then.

478
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,850
Speaker 1: This was the you know, the early days of soda.

479
00:34:23,891 --> 00:34:28,491
Speaker 1: when suddenly people are making soda There's soda fountains and soda juice, but those were good days.

480
00:34:28,572 --> 00:34:30,559
Speaker 0: food never goes out of style.

481
00:34:30,579 --> 00:34:35,839
Speaker 1: So When was the last time anyone drank moxie?

482
00:34:36,661 --> 00:34:38,389
Speaker 0: Most food never goes out of style.

483
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:40,940
Speaker 0: So old food is totally awesome.

484
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:46,067
Speaker 1: Actually, you know, you know, as long as it's not the coca-cola with actual cocaine in it, you know It's big in Costa Rica.

485
00:34:46,549 --> 00:34:48,235
Speaker 1: What tab really?

486
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:52,456
Speaker 0: Yeah Until you got to try that Pepsi throwback and tell me what the deal is.

487
00:34:52,658 --> 00:34:53,020
Speaker 1: I'll try it.

488
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,246
Speaker 1: We got to do a double-blind though.

489
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,636
Speaker 0: Oh, you want me to do it that way?

490
00:34:55,696 --> 00:34:58,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, we should All right, so go buy some cans or whatever.

491
00:34:58,661 --> 00:35:03,720
Speaker 0: I'll get some throwback and then get some and then get some Pepsi also and I could regular old Pepsi.

492
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,225
Speaker 1: I could tell the difference between the dr.

493
00:35:05,265 --> 00:35:06,650
Speaker 1: Peppers, but I the dr.

494
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,215
Speaker 0: Pepper and then we should also.

495
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:09,660
Speaker 0: they think it Mountain Dew throwback.

496
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,283
Speaker 0: So we'll do both.

497
00:35:10,604 --> 00:35:13,920
Speaker 1: but there was I don't know because Mountain Dew I don't think was ever made with sugar.

498
00:35:14,302 --> 00:35:15,889
Speaker 0: Yeah, so they're throwing back to nothing.

499
00:35:15,909 --> 00:35:17,939
Speaker 0: They're throwing back to what Mountain Dew would have been like.

500
00:35:19,623 --> 00:35:19,985
Speaker 0: I don't know.

501
00:35:20,186 --> 00:35:21,072
Speaker 0: It's a. that's all you.

502
00:35:21,132 --> 00:35:21,575
Speaker 0: I don't.

503
00:35:21,655 --> 00:35:25,269
Speaker 0: I don't drink the soda But I do enjoy the idea of the sugar soda.

504
00:35:25,329 --> 00:35:29,604
Speaker 1: Mountain Dew was this weird thing because I can't stand it now It's not a good drink.

505
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:33,099
Speaker 1: But when I was young I drank it all the time, but I didn't even really like it.

506
00:35:33,139 --> 00:35:39,631
Speaker 1: then I drank it because it was the most caffeinated soda I knew about Not more than you didn't know about Joel.

507
00:35:39,973 --> 00:35:41,340
Speaker 0: Well back then I know about Joel.

508
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:46,300
Speaker 1: Joel was hard to get only the bodega was hard to get and even then my parents wouldn't let me go to the bodega.

509
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:50,200
Speaker 0: I was like middle school and it say it was great cuz it said like 2x on it like they were bragging.

510
00:35:50,901 --> 00:35:53,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, now where's Joel Red Bolt own them, but it was weird.

511
00:35:54,060 --> 00:36:03,411
Speaker 1: I remember there was this culture in middle school of those kids what were hopped up on caffeine all the time and Mountain Dew was the drink of choice never would carry around like their 2-liter.

512
00:36:03,492 --> 00:36:04,114
Speaker 1: and like.

513
00:36:04,154 --> 00:36:07,968
Speaker 1: we made a big deal about caffeine and altoids Mmm, I guess that's what we were into.

514
00:36:08,048 --> 00:36:14,760
Speaker 1: I don't know altoids are a big deal in high school But then we discovered kick and we thought that it had more caffeine in it.

515
00:36:15,143 --> 00:36:16,071
Speaker 1: It tasted like ass.

516
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,084
Speaker 0: Why don't you do penguin mints?

517
00:36:18,145 --> 00:36:19,811
Speaker 1: There weren't penguin mints back then.

518
00:36:19,831 --> 00:36:21,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, there were when we were in middle school.

519
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:22,682
Speaker 0: Oh in high school.

520
00:36:22,702 --> 00:36:23,284
Speaker 0: We had penguin mints.

521
00:36:23,304 --> 00:36:24,367
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm talking middle school.

522
00:36:24,508 --> 00:36:25,511
Speaker 1: Okay high school.

523
00:36:25,812 --> 00:36:27,056
Speaker 1: I learned about coffee.

524
00:36:27,076 --> 00:36:33,233
Speaker 0: Uh-huh Anyway, anyway, so we're gonna do show about typing as promised.

525
00:36:33,594 --> 00:36:34,276
Speaker 1: Yes, I sing.

526
00:36:34,516 --> 00:36:35,920
Speaker 0: All right, so the dead?

527
00:36:36,143 --> 00:36:37,160
Speaker 1: So if zombies attack?

528
00:36:38,105 --> 00:36:38,937
Speaker 1: First thing you got to do

529
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:50,355
Speaker 0: I want to talk about learning to type first because you know Like a lot of people have a hard time learning to type and I had you know It was hard for me to learn to type, you know, I used a computer since kindergarten.

530
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,280
Speaker 0: I used a computer, right?

531
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,684
Speaker 1: How did you learn how to type.

532
00:36:52,764 --> 00:36:56,940
Speaker 1: wait what first when did you transition from you know, trying to type to?

533
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,825
Speaker 1: Actually typing correctly.

534
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:02,580
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you know, I was hunted and pecking since kindergarten, right?

535
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,365
Speaker 0: But I got kind of fast ish because I did it so much But it wasn't.

536
00:37:06,526 --> 00:37:14,540
Speaker 0: I wasn't typing properly and I knew I should type properly But I just didn't and I tried to use a couple typing programs, but I never stuck to it really, you know.

537
00:37:15,302 --> 00:37:24,520
Speaker 0: And then in high school, there was a typing class and I eventually got around to taking it I don't know if I've told the story in the show before and the teacher was this old lady.

538
00:37:24,902 --> 00:37:38,674
Speaker 0: She was so old and she was sort of crazy Right, but and it was this computer lab full of IBM xt's like the oldest possible IBM's in the universe and they're these giant clickety clickety keyboards.

539
00:37:38,895 --> 00:37:43,109
Speaker 0: and like I was I Took the last time that class was ever given.

540
00:37:43,129 --> 00:37:45,597
Speaker 0: the lady retired and they got rid of the computer lab.

541
00:37:45,657 --> 00:37:47,571
Speaker 0: right after I took that Class I was like, whoo?

542
00:37:48,620 --> 00:38:05,880
Speaker 0: But I took that class and we went in and they had you know a silly little typing program, you know Where you would you know, it's like there'd be like a little race car, you know on some five and a quarter inch floppy disk And you'd type in the race car would go and we had like it is incredibly incredibly old Microsoft Word.

543
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,617
Speaker 0: we would type in you know in this incredibly blocky font and you know stuff like that.

544
00:38:10,718 --> 00:38:21,695
Speaker 0: and just Doing it going to that class every day, you know five days a week and sticking to it Like suddenly I didn't even realize you know that I was like, oh shit.

545
00:38:21,735 --> 00:38:22,257
Speaker 0: I'm typing.

546
00:38:22,418 --> 00:38:24,123
Speaker 0: Oh shit Yes, I got it.

547
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:34,960
Speaker 0: You know, it's like I was thinking hard about it, you know for a while like, okay that letters over here That letter this finger in that direction and I still don't type a hundred percent properly.

548
00:38:35,141 --> 00:38:37,569
Speaker 0: I mean, I never used the right shift ever.

549
00:38:37,589 --> 00:38:38,873
Speaker 0: I know I'm supposed to.

550
00:38:38,933 --> 00:38:39,857
Speaker 0: I just don't really.

551
00:38:39,877 --> 00:38:40,880
Speaker 0: I never use right shift.

552
00:38:40,961 --> 00:38:42,460
Speaker 0: I always use left shift for everything.

553
00:38:43,022 --> 00:38:54,640
Speaker 0: So if I'm like gonna type an uppercase a I'll move my ring finger all the way over to the a. you know Also like up in the middle area up in the top in the middle where the index fingers go like in the TU area.

554
00:38:55,242 --> 00:39:00,420
Speaker 0: You know, I always like sometimes my fingers will cross over to the other side.

555
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:06,580
Speaker 0: It's like I'll use the left index and I should use the right index and vice versa sometimes and also the numbers above.

556
00:39:07,183 --> 00:39:11,140
Speaker 0: You know the the numpad numbers I can type, you know, I take my hand to put on the numpad.

557
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,165
Speaker 0: I can type like crazy.

558
00:39:12,608 --> 00:39:18,888
Speaker 0: but the numbers above the letters I have to look sometimes or feel around or I'll hit the wrong one sometimes.

559
00:39:19,389 --> 00:39:20,752
Speaker 0: but other than that I type, you know.

560
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:32,160
Speaker 1: See I never really took typing classes like they had it in my school and when I was in like fifth grade We had to do these kind of exercises.

561
00:39:32,702 --> 00:39:41,880
Speaker 1: They they had this thing called computer class and I think that was when I realized that pretty much no one Anywhere near me in the world at that time knew anything about computers.

562
00:39:42,161 --> 00:39:47,980
Speaker 0: I learned that in kindergarten when you know, I could play word but the teacher didn't know how to play word much.

563
00:39:48,402 --> 00:39:54,848
Speaker 1: I never owned a computer of my own and I found the word much is debug menu until my 486 SX to 486 DX.

564
00:39:55,009 --> 00:39:57,400
Speaker 1: for but well, I guess it felt my Atari.

565
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,773
Speaker 0: But anyway, but I remember tired 7800 is not a computer.

566
00:40:00,853 --> 00:40:04,555
Speaker 1: They would take technically it is I guess Yeah, they would take me my time.

567
00:40:04,615 --> 00:40:05,180
Speaker 1: X was a computer.

568
00:40:05,281 --> 00:40:08,419
Speaker 1: I'll go into this room and it had all these old computers on the wall.

569
00:40:08,841 --> 00:40:15,968
Speaker 1: I never would set a computer and log in by typing your name But if my name was screwed up because there's a space in my name so I would only type the first two letters.

570
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:20,849
Speaker 1: if I typed anything else it would crash and Then it would ask us questions.

571
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,919
Speaker 1: Like what's four plus five?

572
00:40:23,848 --> 00:40:24,879
Speaker 1: What color is this?

573
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,605
Speaker 1: What color is that?

574
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:34,400
Speaker 1: and every now and then it'd be this typing exercise Which was just type the sentence you're looking at and if you don't type the right letter nothing happens.

575
00:40:35,082 --> 00:40:36,848
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, and it was awful.

576
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:38,012
Speaker 1: I don't learn how to type.

577
00:40:38,032 --> 00:40:40,000
Speaker 0: that's not gonna help you learn to type not at all.

578
00:40:40,744 --> 00:40:43,500
Speaker 1: When I really learned how to type was when I finally got my computer.

579
00:40:43,701 --> 00:40:47,940
Speaker 1: I got online and I was hanging out in prodigy chat room No shit.

580
00:40:48,141 --> 00:40:52,820
Speaker 1: And I wanted to say stuff to people and I had to say stuff quickly or I'd be get left behind.

581
00:40:53,603 --> 00:40:58,560
Speaker 1: I learned how to type very very rapidly just by actually having to type to do other things.

582
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:02,073
Speaker 1: It's the I find my whole life and I think this applies to all technology.

583
00:41:02,475 --> 00:41:05,586
Speaker 1: if you want to learn a technology Don't try to learn that technology.

584
00:41:05,887 --> 00:41:09,440
Speaker 1: try to do something with that technology and you'll learn it as a course.

585
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,337
Speaker 1: I'm just doing it.

586
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:16,987
Speaker 0: But the other thing is, you know, if you you know, a lot of people like, you know They'll say I want to learn Python or something, right?

587
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:20,640
Speaker 0: So they'll be like, okay, and they'll go about learning it.

588
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,548
Speaker 0: It's like no, no, no, that doesn't that doesn't work.

589
00:41:22,588 --> 00:41:25,440
Speaker 0: You need to have a need for it to learn, you know.

590
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,480
Speaker 0: It's like I want to learn how to swing a hammer.

591
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:39,700
Speaker 0: Well, I hope you have something you're gonna make that needs hammering and it has to be something you actually want to make and not Just you know some board with a bunch of nails in it for the purpose of hammering, you know It has to be a real thing that you want.

592
00:41:40,102 --> 00:41:42,411
Speaker 0: So that requires you to learn the skill.

593
00:41:42,431 --> 00:41:47,000
Speaker 0: if you're not required to learn the skill It's gonna be very difficult to learn the skill for reals.

594
00:41:48,043 --> 00:41:55,720
Speaker 0: And now the other thing something I've realized right is That you know, it's funny that you talk about how you learn to type from a chat room, right?

595
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,511
Speaker 0: But if you look around the world today majority people don't.

596
00:41:59,832 --> 00:42:09,740
Speaker 0: well, I think what it is is that You know, we talk about like AOL speaks, you know, like lol, you know They're tech speak or whatever the fuck you want to call it.

597
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:15,619
Speaker 0: Basically, you know not typing properly not spelling things using like the letter U instead of you

598
00:42:16,324 --> 00:42:23,800
Speaker 1: I always felt even when I was a young kid I always felt like people who typed like that were just solving a problem in the wrong way like the price of the problem.

599
00:42:24,202 --> 00:42:28,700
Speaker 1: I cannot type fast enough to say what I want to say quickly solution type shittier.

600
00:42:29,041 --> 00:42:36,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I sort of realized like, you know people sort of get this idea that that text speak AOL speak kind of typing.

601
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:44,802
Speaker 0: You know where you leave out all these vowels and use the letter R instead of ARE is because of bad grammar or lack of Intelligence?

602
00:42:45,284 --> 00:42:45,826
Speaker 0: it's not.

603
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:49,280
Speaker 0: it's simply because of bad typing skills.

604
00:42:49,481 --> 00:42:51,628
Speaker 0: All right, and it has nothing to do with age either.

605
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:53,675
Speaker 0: I mean my grandma right?

606
00:42:54,097 --> 00:42:55,020
Speaker 0: She doesn't know how to type.

607
00:42:55,221 --> 00:42:56,547
Speaker 0: She can't type for hilla beans.

608
00:42:56,608 --> 00:43:00,465
Speaker 0: And the only thing she really knows how to use is, you know GM or pigeon to.

609
00:43:00,585 --> 00:43:01,207
Speaker 0: I am people.

610
00:43:01,488 --> 00:43:05,160
Speaker 0: that's all she knows how to do right and she refuses to learn anything else.

611
00:43:05,501 --> 00:43:08,656
Speaker 0: so we just sort of given up on her and she's stubborn and impatient.

612
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:20,679
Speaker 0: but When she types she'll type like the letter U and it's not because she's some 13 year old kid it's because she wants to send you the message quickly and she can't type.

613
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:28,440
Speaker 0: and You know, even an old person will naturally arrive at that solution without, you know hearing of that solution from anyone else.

614
00:43:28,781 --> 00:43:34,280
Speaker 0: She wasn't influenced by anyone else typing like that to her or seeing anyone else talk like that.

615
00:43:34,621 --> 00:43:39,180
Speaker 0: She arrived there on her own, you know, and you're typing on like a cell phone, you know.

616
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:43,814
Speaker 0: And it doesn't have a full keyboard like a blackberry or even if it does it's hard to type.

617
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:55,650
Speaker 0: and that's why people you know When they're texting not just because of the character limit, but also because of that but because About that about why it's the number of characters that it is.

618
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:56,452
Speaker 1: It's fascinating.

619
00:43:56,472 --> 00:43:56,632
Speaker 0: Yeah.

620
00:43:56,672 --> 00:43:59,260
Speaker 0: Well, it's because texts go on like this sideband.

621
00:43:59,441 --> 00:44:01,560
Speaker 0: It's like it's it's in the routing protocol.

622
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:07,978
Speaker 1: No, it talks about the magic number of you know, how many characters you need on average to form complete sentences?

623
00:44:07,998 --> 00:44:09,427
Speaker 1: Oh Yeah, there's.

624
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:16,879
Speaker 0: there's an interesting article You see because the other thing the other interesting technological thing is that text messages aren't actually sent on their own.

625
00:44:16,899 --> 00:44:25,178
Speaker 1: Yes That's why that's why the article is so fascinating because it talks about how they it would have just been 128 characters because that was perfect for the sideband they had.

626
00:44:25,198 --> 00:44:29,833
Speaker 1: yeah But it turned out that the magic number for typing sentences.

627
00:44:29,853 --> 00:44:42,217
Speaker 1: a guy just sat down and wrote all these random Sentences whatever he was thinking of and he counted the characters and he decided that 128 characters Prevents you from saying anything meaningful, but a hundred and sixty was this magic number.

628
00:44:42,237 --> 00:44:45,794
Speaker 1: Uh-huh Yeah, but yet the I didn't read the whole article.

629
00:44:45,834 --> 00:44:46,920
Speaker 1: So I'm going based on slash.

630
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,253
Speaker 0: We'll talk about text messages themselves.

631
00:44:49,273 --> 00:44:49,816
Speaker 0: We should do a show.

632
00:44:49,876 --> 00:44:50,158
Speaker 0: I don't know.

633
00:44:50,198 --> 00:44:51,220
Speaker 1: effort show Yeah, whatever.

634
00:44:51,381 --> 00:44:58,707
Speaker 1: But one thing I really find interesting is that when I first got online like really not prodigy, you know and all those chat rooms the BBS is.

635
00:44:58,767 --> 00:45:09,965
Speaker 1: but when I got ICQ back in the day when While they're probably were shit cockers there weren't nearly as many because there was a barrier to entry and I'm not saying the barrier to Entries you'd come back.

636
00:45:10,468 --> 00:45:11,716
Speaker 1: It's just you know, it was different time.

637
00:45:11,736 --> 00:45:19,964
Speaker 1: you understand 1987 88 like 1997 98 that's more likely but nobody typed like that.

638
00:45:20,204 --> 00:45:31,240
Speaker 1: the only people who typed in that kind of halting lead speak any of that stuff were the idiots and Everyone like when I was online, you know talking to people in ICQ just going into random chat rooms.

639
00:45:31,702 --> 00:45:37,273
Speaker 1: It was, you know begin sentences with uppercase letters end them with punctuation semicolons.

640
00:45:38,462 --> 00:45:42,422
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it's simply a matter of typing skill, you know It's like.

641
00:45:42,522 --> 00:45:44,551
Speaker 0: I knew plenty of people that are actually like.

642
00:45:44,751 --> 00:45:54,759
Speaker 0: you'll see executives type, you know Like emailing really stupidly and it's not because they're stupid It's because they can't type for shit and they can't be bothered to sit there.

643
00:45:55,081 --> 00:46:03,399
Speaker 0: You know doing the one finger jabs to write this gigantic essay, you know There for days kind of randomly faster than to write with a pen.

644
00:46:03,862 --> 00:46:11,687
Speaker 1: I was I was writing documentation for our internal wiki and I use the acronym WYSIWYG a bunch of times and I realized that I can type.

645
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:14,280
Speaker 1: what you see is what you get faster than I can type WYSIWYG.

646
00:46:15,081 --> 00:46:15,804
Speaker 0: It's about the same.

647
00:46:15,824 --> 00:46:19,620
Speaker 1: I cuz I have to stop and think about what letters are in WYSIWYG because it's not.

648
00:46:20,306 --> 00:46:27,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not an acronym WYSIWYG It's not an acronym that works for the letters in my brain.

649
00:46:27,381 --> 00:46:30,420
Speaker 1: It works as like this one phenom like this word WYSIWYG.

650
00:46:30,802 --> 00:46:33,115
Speaker 1: So when I have to type it, it's a lot easier to type.

651
00:46:33,155 --> 00:46:33,960
Speaker 1: what you see is what you get.

652
00:46:34,321 --> 00:46:36,309
Speaker 1: Yep, exactly, and it bothered me.

653
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:36,991
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

654
00:46:37,393 --> 00:46:39,260
Speaker 0: now something else about typing, right?

655
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,334
Speaker 0: I mean we've done shows on keyboards before.

656
00:46:41,676 --> 00:46:57,009
Speaker 0: but like I said I learned on the IBM XT and I actually think that if you're going to learn to type You should try to find an IBM XT keyboard Which it is possible to make an IBM XT keyboard work With a modern computer.

657
00:46:57,029 --> 00:46:58,255
Speaker 1: I mean, I have the DOS keyboard.

658
00:46:58,476 --> 00:46:59,180
Speaker 0: That's pretty close.

659
00:46:59,725 --> 00:47:00,898
Speaker 1: I love this thing so much.

660
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:07,860
Speaker 0: Then the main thing about the reasons the XT or a similar keyboard are good for learning to type on is number one.

661
00:47:08,323 --> 00:47:10,420
Speaker 0: The buttons are hard to push down.

662
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:13,692
Speaker 0: Relatively speaking they have a lot of tactile feedback.

663
00:47:13,712 --> 00:47:17,190
Speaker 0: They click they snap, you know There's a lot of space between.

664
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:20,020
Speaker 1: the tactile feedback is key If you want to be a touch typist, right?

665
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:24,720
Speaker 1: I mean, have you ever tried to type on a non feedback keyboard at all?

666
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:27,067
Speaker 1: Like one of those solid surfaces with capacitance.

667
00:47:27,448 --> 00:47:30,036
Speaker 0: Yeah, like you type, you know, like on a table.

668
00:47:30,117 --> 00:47:31,180
Speaker 0: you ever seen that like keyboard?

669
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,517
Speaker 0: That's like a laser thing that you know draws a keyboard on the table.

670
00:47:34,538 --> 00:47:34,940
Speaker 0: with a laser.

671
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:44,908
Speaker 1: I mean the thing where for like 10 years every on the internet you kept seeing pictures of a company saying Yeah, we know you can buy it But it's now you can but for a long time you couldn't.

672
00:47:45,069 --> 00:47:50,398
Speaker 1: but even like these pictures of it and people saying yes We made it it's coming out next week and then it never.

673
00:47:50,418 --> 00:47:54,540
Speaker 0: yeah But I try to learn like, you know how to type on a laptop keyboard, right?

674
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:56,970
Speaker 0: It's hard to feel your way around.

675
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:58,074
Speaker 0: the whole thing is flat.

676
00:47:58,135 --> 00:47:59,400
Speaker 0: It's not at an angle, right?

677
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,040
Speaker 0: I mean if you learn how to type already you can type on a laptop keyboard.

678
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:10,220
Speaker 0: But learning to type on a laptop keyboard is asking for trouble because you're not getting all this help.

679
00:48:10,702 --> 00:48:19,680
Speaker 0: You know in in, you know that teaches your fingers, you know an initial D. They talk about the hachi roku is the car that teaches you how to race because the car gives you all this feedback.

680
00:48:19,841 --> 00:48:20,784
Speaker 0: It's an old piece of junk.

681
00:48:20,804 --> 00:48:31,691
Speaker 0: All right, but the old piece of junk, you know by just by driving it You can sort of feel things out and learn things where if you started by driving a Ferrari You wouldn't be able to learn those things.

682
00:48:31,711 --> 00:48:33,060
Speaker 0: you would just die, right?

683
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:50,180
Speaker 0: So if you're learning to type you should type on like a really really standard keyboard with you know big You know keys that are far apart standard size, you know Hopefully very springy and clicky if possible, you know, not mushy and comfortable.

684
00:48:50,381 --> 00:48:52,779
Speaker 1: But then again, I learned how to type without any of that.

685
00:48:53,341 --> 00:48:58,415
Speaker 0: Yeah, and that's why you don't but you don't type properly according to the correct typing way.

686
00:48:58,515 --> 00:49:00,360
Speaker 1: actually type with perfect home row now.

687
00:49:00,661 --> 00:49:01,082
Speaker 0: Oh really?

688
00:49:01,143 --> 00:49:05,399
Speaker 0: Cuz you used to you know, give you some bullshit like oh I typed with some made-up met that I made up.

689
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,520
Speaker 1: now I didn't make up a method.

690
00:49:07,203 --> 00:49:14,160
Speaker 1: I noticed that when I used to type partly because the way I would always sit because you know, no lessons I learned to type just because I was in chat room.

691
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:19,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, you didn't you didn't learn, you know, according to the you know The rules of typing you just learned a natural method of your hand.

692
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:21,448
Speaker 1: but my natural method was fast.

693
00:49:21,508 --> 00:49:27,520
Speaker 1: and the real point I want to make is that if you want to learn how to type the Most foolproof way is to never take shortcuts

694
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:28,622
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm

695
00:49:28,702 --> 00:49:33,260
Speaker 1: because I always typed in complete sentences and I typed with perfect grammar and I thought a lot about what I was saying.

696
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:41,120
Speaker 1: So as a result, I was forced to either type very very slowly and be frustrated all the time or get faster very quickly.

697
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:46,620
Speaker 0: Yep, you know, I mean if you type in complete sentences the correct grammar, right and all these things.

698
00:49:46,961 --> 00:49:50,754
Speaker 0: You're actually gonna force yourselves to use all the keys on the keyboard.

699
00:49:50,815 --> 00:49:51,738
Speaker 0: Not just a few of them.

700
00:49:51,778 --> 00:49:56,520
Speaker 0: more often You know, so you're gonna be forced to use, you know, the shift key to capitalize.

701
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:03,226
Speaker 0: You're gonna be forced to use like the periods and the commas down low and the question marks and you know if you code that's even better.

702
00:50:03,246 --> 00:50:09,449
Speaker 0: because you're gonna be forced to use the curly braces and the back slashes and the Asterisks and the who knows what right.

703
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:17,940
Speaker 0: and by forcing yourself to use more of the keys You'll be better at typing if you only if the less keys you use the less typing skill you'll have.

704
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:20,133
Speaker 1: But what I used to do, you know, you you said I had a method.

705
00:50:20,153 --> 00:50:20,395
Speaker 1: I didn't.

706
00:50:20,415 --> 00:50:29,340
Speaker 1: it was just that I Tended to always be at this angle from the keyboard just because I sat like I Just kind of as slouched as possible like sideways in the chair.

707
00:50:29,902 --> 00:50:31,690
Speaker 1: So the keyboard was at an angle to my hands.

708
00:50:32,092 --> 00:50:34,080
Speaker 1: So my hands kind of just read an angle to the keyboard.

709
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:39,298
Speaker 1: I always typed with the keyboard at like a 30-degree angle counterclockwise Mm-hmm.

710
00:50:39,441 --> 00:50:41,140
Speaker 1: So as a result my hands like floated.

711
00:50:41,642 --> 00:50:48,537
Speaker 1: But I realized later that this is why I respect home row printing or piping so much And why I think you should learn home row if you can.

712
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:58,520
Speaker 1: Naturally while my hands kind of floated and I was at this angle my two index fingers Naturally always ended up hovering over where they should have been in the home row.

713
00:50:58,982 --> 00:51:04,909
Speaker 1: It's just that my whole hand pivoted left and right with the pinky finger on the other end Mm-hmm, but it's still like.

714
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:10,120
Speaker 1: completely naturally and without instruction I gravitated toward the home row because it is the most efficient way to type.

715
00:51:10,381 --> 00:51:13,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the other thing is you know the home row, right?

716
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:21,299
Speaker 0: You know this little nubs on the F and the J usually some keyboards like maybe the D and the K But mostly the F and the J for you to you know.

717
00:51:21,601 --> 00:51:25,620
Speaker 0: So that way without looking you can feel where to put your hands.

718
00:51:25,841 --> 00:51:28,080
Speaker 0: You know because you feel these little nubs on two of the keys.

719
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:40,016
Speaker 0: That's where you put your index fingers And I think that's a big thing is not looking and if you have to get a keyboard that doesn't have any letters on it So you can't look and I think that will really help you.

720
00:51:40,076 --> 00:51:50,379
Speaker 0: if you have a you know I mean it takes some willpower if you're especially if you're used to looking to not look You know and it took me like a couple weeks to like you know stop looking you know.

721
00:51:52,082 --> 00:52:04,049
Speaker 0: So if you're having trouble learning you know because you keep looking Get a blank keyboard and that goes and force yourself to use it and throw and block up all your other Keyboards in a closet or something or very easily.

722
00:52:04,069 --> 00:52:06,800
Speaker 1: if you can't get a blank keyboard just get a Dvorak keyboard.

723
00:52:07,948 --> 00:52:09,645
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, yeah Get a Dvorak keyboard.

724
00:52:09,665 --> 00:52:15,167
Speaker 0: or like pluck the keys off your keyboard and move them all around Because you can take keys off most keyboards

725
00:52:15,267 --> 00:52:18,678
Speaker 1: on most keyboards not for a long time the old IBM ones you could

726
00:52:18,999 --> 00:52:23,414
Speaker 0: yeah But I don't know Normal the kind of keyboard that I suggested you should be learning on.

727
00:52:23,835 --> 00:52:26,254
Speaker 1: you can take the keys off But those keyboards aren't that common.

728
00:52:26,538 --> 00:52:27,605
Speaker 0: yeah But take the key.

729
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:30,300
Speaker 0: if you can take the keys off and shuffle them around.

730
00:52:30,702 --> 00:52:32,511
Speaker 0: That way you can't look because looking won't

731
00:52:32,552 --> 00:52:42,893
Speaker 1: help you see but at the same time Looking works just fine for me early on learning because I kind of I was trying to type quickly so I'd stare at the T keyboard and I kind of watch what my hands were doing and think about what they were doing.

732
00:52:42,913 --> 00:52:52,578
Speaker 0: see something else that actually helps is If you keep looking down right because the idea is you don't just get efficiency from being able to type quickly.

733
00:52:52,598 --> 00:52:57,954
Speaker 0: you get Efficiency from being able to look at the screen while typing right.

734
00:52:58,195 --> 00:53:03,320
Speaker 0: let's say you know how to type real fast But you have to look right so you'll look down at your hands.

735
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:04,399
Speaker 0: You know type a whole sentence.

736
00:53:04,801 --> 00:53:07,131
Speaker 0: Then you'll look up and then see the typo.

737
00:53:07,312 --> 00:53:09,100
Speaker 0: then you have to go back and edit the typo.

738
00:53:09,542 --> 00:53:20,120
Speaker 0: But if you're looking while typing you'll see the typo when it appears and you'll Backspace it real quick with your typing skills and the sentence will be correct in a much faster amount of time.

739
00:53:20,722 --> 00:53:25,820
Speaker 0: So what you can do if you're having trouble looking and you can't shuffle the keys or get a blank keyboard?

740
00:53:26,561 --> 00:53:30,411
Speaker 0: Get an on-screen just like a graphic of the keyboard on the screen.

741
00:53:30,892 --> 00:53:33,620
Speaker 0: that way your eyes will at least be on the screen.

742
00:53:34,222 --> 00:53:38,539
Speaker 0: You won't have to look down at the keyboard because you have a reminder on the screen of where the keys are.

743
00:53:38,941 --> 00:53:41,956
Speaker 1: That is an absolutely fantastic way to learn how to type.

744
00:53:42,037 --> 00:53:42,680
Speaker 0: It's very good.

745
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,086
Speaker 0: That's most typing programs.

746
00:53:44,126 --> 00:53:48,123
Speaker 0: have a picture of the keyboard on the screen in the early phases You know.

747
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:51,959
Speaker 1: for that very reason actually I have one other really important hint.

748
00:53:52,840 --> 00:54:02,860
Speaker 1: Don't you at least when you're trying to learn how to type for computer stuff as much as possible early on Don't use the numbers at the top use your right hand only on the numpad and learn ten key typing?

749
00:54:03,001 --> 00:54:03,948
Speaker 0: Yes, you should be.

750
00:54:03,988 --> 00:54:05,540
Speaker 1: typing will save your ass.

751
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:17,965
Speaker 0: You definitely want to learn how to type on the numpad to do like a whole bunch of numbers Like I use it all the time for example like I use list all right and I buy get a bunch of books in the mail and then I want to enter them all in With the ISBN numbers.

752
00:54:18,548 --> 00:54:22,299
Speaker 0: if I wasn't using the numpad, you know, how long that would take like forever.

753
00:54:23,122 --> 00:54:24,092
Speaker 0: So but I use the numpad.

754
00:54:24,153 --> 00:54:24,800
Speaker 0: He says like did it?

755
00:54:25,361 --> 00:54:25,943
Speaker 1: That's the one thing.

756
00:54:25,983 --> 00:54:30,320
Speaker 1: I was actually trained in ten key because my first job was for the US Census doing payroll.

757
00:54:31,023 --> 00:54:35,200
Speaker 0: So I would type in everyone's time sheets, yeah, I mean a lot of keyboards today don't have the numpad.

758
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:47,480
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't have a numpad on my keyboard, but I have a separate numpad because Sometimes you just have to enter in a bunch of numbers, you know And if you're gonna enter in a bunch of numbers a spreadsheet or something.

759
00:54:48,143 --> 00:54:58,080
Speaker 0: the numpad is just so much faster like times a bajillion and It's something you know, you might not use it often, but when you're using it, it's so helpful.

760
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:04,235
Speaker 0: You really numpad typing is almost as important as the regular keyboard typing and you should learn that too.

761
00:55:04,295 --> 00:55:04,916
Speaker 0: Don't neglect it.

762
00:55:04,936 --> 00:55:07,848
Speaker 1: I Really don't recommend typing games.

763
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:11,389
Speaker 1: They diving typing in the dead is fun But at the same time you're gonna be.

764
00:55:11,409 --> 00:55:13,340
Speaker 1: you know, I've seen there seems well, they're good.

765
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:15,307
Speaker 0: They're not good for learning to type.

766
00:55:15,568 --> 00:55:18,760
Speaker 0: they're good for you know, maintaining your typing skills.

767
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:27,940
Speaker 1: But at the same time I feel like I see two different kinds of good typists and they're the people who type like 110 words a minute, but they make a mistake every other word.

768
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,700
Speaker 1: They're just so fast that they make up for all the mistakes constantly by backspacing.

769
00:55:32,342 --> 00:55:36,954
Speaker 1: And then there are people who type like 70 words a minute, but they never make mistakes ever.

770
00:55:37,234 --> 00:55:37,455
Speaker 0: Yep.

771
00:55:38,297 --> 00:55:39,340
Speaker 1: I'm in the former category.

772
00:55:39,421 --> 00:55:45,175
Speaker 1: I'll type like 120 words a minute But you'll see me like backspacing like at least once in every word.

773
00:55:45,597 --> 00:55:47,343
Speaker 0: mine sort of you know My with me.

774
00:55:47,403 --> 00:55:54,879
Speaker 0: it varies like if I'm typing something that's not too long like, you know Maybe I am or a tweet or a forum post.

775
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:56,666
Speaker 0: 99% of the time.

776
00:55:56,686 --> 00:56:02,020
Speaker 0: it'll be a hundred percent correct and it won't be so fast But it'll be you know fast real fast.

777
00:56:02,721 --> 00:56:08,501
Speaker 0: But I go on typing something big like a blog post or an essay or something Like.

778
00:56:08,522 --> 00:56:12,800
Speaker 0: I'll type as fast or even faster than the ideas come into my brain.

779
00:56:13,281 --> 00:56:17,938
Speaker 0: But when I go back over it, they'll be miss, you know, four or five mistakes, you know every.

780
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:18,139
Speaker 0: you know.

781
00:56:18,701 --> 00:56:21,048
Speaker 0: Mistake per paragraph you wanted.

782
00:56:21,129 --> 00:56:25,272
Speaker 1: as long as you can type faster than you can think of what you want to type You're good to go.

783
00:56:25,293 --> 00:56:29,537
Speaker 0: Yeah Then you're not limited in any way, you know, you know 120 words a minute.

784
00:56:30,241 --> 00:56:33,900
Speaker 1: I'm not going to be thinking of a hundred and twenty useful words to type in a minute.

785
00:56:34,282 --> 00:56:37,200
Speaker 1: That's only useful if you're doing something like transcribing.

786
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:44,512
Speaker 0: Yeah transcribing and that's the reason a lot of people have Transcribers still like lawyers and like old lawyers and people like.

787
00:56:44,532 --> 00:56:46,680
Speaker 0: that is because you know, they're from the olden days.

788
00:56:47,101 --> 00:56:53,360
Speaker 0: They never typed they need to get lots of words onto paper, but they don't have any typing skills and they have.

789
00:56:54,222 --> 00:56:54,925
Speaker 1: You know that dr.

790
00:56:54,945 --> 00:56:56,209
Speaker 1: Pepper thing I was talking about.

791
00:56:56,349 --> 00:56:59,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, the biggest trouble they're having is that no one can read the handwriting in the ledger.

792
00:57:00,801 --> 00:57:02,709
Speaker 1: It's all in cursive and no one can read it.

793
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:19,879
Speaker 0: Damn, we can read ancient tablets of stone with Sanskrit on them, but we can't read the dr Pepper, you know the way you said that I expected you to say ancient spirits of evil Transform this decade form into legible handwriting.

794
00:57:24,462 --> 00:57:26,451
Speaker 1: Okay, I don't know what else we can say about typing.

795
00:57:26,511 --> 00:57:27,154
Speaker 1: learn to type.

796
00:57:27,496 --> 00:57:29,786
Speaker 0: yeah everyone, you know You should really learn to type.

797
00:57:30,028 --> 00:57:35,971
Speaker 0: and you know, I think actually here Here's an incentive to learn to type right if you think about it in our forum.

798
00:57:36,413 --> 00:57:44,640
Speaker 0: We demand you know Excellent grammar and spelling, you know, we're not super perfect demanding, but it's got to be good.

799
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:48,135
Speaker 0: You know, none of this, you know normal internet crap, right?

800
00:57:48,617 --> 00:58:02,296
Speaker 0: The thing is the reason that we demand that is not because we you know want excellent grammar and spelling but because if you're forced to have excellent grammar and spelling you'll be forced to think about what you're typing and thus you'll make better posts.

801
00:58:02,718 --> 00:58:10,679
Speaker 0: and if a post is Poopy and crappy you won't even bother and thus the overall, you know signal-to-noise ratio of quality on the forum will be up.

802
00:58:11,301 --> 00:58:17,720
Speaker 0: But if you learn to type right you won't have to think so much about typing a whole bunch of stuff in the forum.

803
00:58:17,882 --> 00:58:27,760
Speaker 0: so If you learn to type you can post a bunch of crap and probably get away with it Because you're gonna have great grammar and spelling and a big long post and type a bunch of bullshit.

804
00:58:28,301 --> 00:58:30,809
Speaker 0: But if you're typing in space for typing is bad.

805
00:58:31,451 --> 00:58:34,240
Speaker 0: You're gonna and it's gonna take you forever to type a bunch of bullshit.

806
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:40,344
Speaker 0: So it's getting much more difficult for you to make low quality posts Especially fanboy pose.

807
00:58:40,364 --> 00:58:49,155
Speaker 0: Yeah, so being a fanboy with typing skills you have you have this Incredible dangerous power to spread stupidity at greater speeds.

808
00:58:49,376 --> 00:59:03,644
Speaker 1: actually some of the greatest fun I had was that back in the day with ICQ you could you can either type and people would see what you were typing in real time, which was the default or You could have it to where you could type your message and then hit enter and then it would go or alt enter in my case.

809
00:59:03,685 --> 00:59:04,029
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

810
00:59:04,556 --> 00:59:10,470
Speaker 1: So Everyone I knew had it set to where I could see what they were typing, but they didn't realize that was what was going on.

811
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:19,930
Speaker 1: so both a lot of people typed so slowly that they would start to like say something like ask a question and I would Answer the question before they sent it.

812
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:25,271
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm You would not believe the amount of mayhem I could cause.

813
00:59:25,391 --> 00:59:28,219
Speaker 1: I convinced a large number of people that I had psychic powers.

814
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:41,860
Speaker 0: Wow a large number is four or five but still Yeah You know, I think the other thing to say is that you know keyboards, right?

815
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,120
Speaker 0: I mean computers have been around for a while and just about every aspect of them is improved.

816
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,126
Speaker 0: We invented the mouse.

817
00:59:47,427 --> 00:59:49,640
Speaker 0: we upgraded to the optical mouse the laser mouse.

818
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:50,865
Speaker 0: We put more buttons on the mouse.

819
00:59:51,146 --> 00:59:52,150
Speaker 0: the mouse is evolving.

820
00:59:52,472 --> 00:59:56,264
Speaker 0: The keyboard is evolving a little bit, you know They're moving the keys around.

821
00:59:56,525 --> 01:00:02,298
Speaker 0: some of the keyboards are getting stupid, you know, but really the keyboard is not going anywhere.

822
01:00:02,318 --> 01:00:04,044
Speaker 0: and You know, it's.

823
01:00:04,144 --> 01:00:06,754
Speaker 0: it's like the mouse doesn't take much learning to.

824
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:09,717
Speaker 0: you know master, you know It's sort of intuitive in a way.

825
01:00:10,522 --> 01:00:13,712
Speaker 0: The keyboard needs mastery and it's not going anywhere.

826
01:00:13,913 --> 01:00:16,220
Speaker 0: The keyboard is gonna be around for a long.

827
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,927
Speaker 1: Longevity is evidence of its efficiency.

828
01:00:18,987 --> 01:00:19,288
Speaker 0: Yes.

829
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:21,094
Speaker 0: The keyboard is not going anywhere.

830
01:00:21,134 --> 01:00:22,800
Speaker 0: It's been around since the typewriter.

831
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:29,893
Speaker 0: It's gonna be around for at least another decade or two though I do have to say all the it's not more almost every improvement.

832
01:00:29,913 --> 01:00:30,154
Speaker 1: I've said.

833
01:00:30,174 --> 01:00:31,560
Speaker 1: well quote unquote improvement.

834
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:32,605
Speaker 1: I've seen two keyboards.

835
01:00:33,408 --> 01:00:35,036
Speaker 1: It's not actually improvement in my opinion.

836
01:00:35,056 --> 01:00:37,006
Speaker 1: like those split keyboards I feel like no good.

837
01:00:37,349 --> 01:00:39,020
Speaker 1: All they do is slow you down and hurt your wrist.

838
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:52,820
Speaker 0: You know I have the happy hacking keyboard and the improvements it makes are the escape key is closer because I hit it very often because I Use vim which is not useful for most people who barely ever hit escape escape colon right percent sign.

839
01:00:53,701 --> 01:00:56,975
Speaker 0: There's a control instead of a caps lock, which is nice.

840
01:00:57,498 --> 01:01:01,320
Speaker 1: Yeah Of course, do we really need pause anymore?

841
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:03,649
Speaker 0: No, but we don't.

842
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:06,000
Speaker 1: and who in the world types in insert mode?

843
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:13,536
Speaker 1: Well, the insert key is useful for other things Yes, but in many things that I do like if I'm in Word, I accidentally hit that key.

844
01:01:13,556 --> 01:01:14,620
Speaker 1: I'm fucked.

845
01:01:15,164 --> 01:01:23,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, that has never been useful to me No, but like shift insert like is paste in something and whatever the other thing I really need to get out here.

846
01:01:24,202 --> 01:01:27,716
Speaker 1: I had arguments at work about this and one because I'm on the right side.

847
01:01:27,796 --> 01:01:28,559
Speaker 1: Scott agrees with me.

848
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:34,080
Speaker 1: Don't learn anything but QWERTY unless you speak a foreign language and have to use a foreign keyboard.

849
01:01:34,341 --> 01:01:36,026
Speaker 1: QWERTY is the only worthwhile keyboard.

850
01:01:36,046 --> 01:01:38,193
Speaker 1: Dvorak is absolute gibberish.

851
01:01:38,575 --> 01:01:39,197
Speaker 1: It's useless.

852
01:01:39,457 --> 01:01:40,180
Speaker 1: It's not better.

853
01:01:40,502 --> 01:01:42,453
Speaker 1: Anyone says it's better ask them for evidence.

854
01:01:42,635 --> 01:01:43,520
Speaker 1: There's no evidence.

855
01:01:43,881 --> 01:01:49,320
Speaker 1: It's this minority thing the only people who use two people who think it's cool or rationalize some bullshit reason for using it.

856
01:01:49,701 --> 01:02:00,030
Speaker 0: They just want to be different and they think it's better because they're like, oh look They took the most frequently used things and put them right near the index finger To be different, but they don't want to admit that.

857
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:02,397
Speaker 1: so they rationalize why they're different.

858
01:02:02,478 --> 01:02:03,180
Speaker 0: that's correct.

859
01:02:03,361 --> 01:02:08,579
Speaker 0: But the rationalization has no basis in science or ergonomics or anything.

860
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:13,600
Speaker 1: learning Dvorak is just gonna slow you down in QWERTY and make you generally incompatible with almost the entire world.

861
01:02:13,761 --> 01:02:16,260
Speaker 0: And there are people who say that they can just switch back and forth.

862
01:02:16,742 --> 01:02:26,639
Speaker 0: But they say I've seen people who have said they can switch back and forth sit at a QWERTY and go And mess up right and go oops just like I sit at a Dvorak and go oops.

863
01:02:26,941 --> 01:02:28,269
Speaker 1: Well, if I sit at a Dvorak I go.

864
01:02:28,329 --> 01:02:29,516
Speaker 1: what the fuck is this?

865
01:02:29,536 --> 01:02:30,140
Speaker 0: That's right.

866
01:02:30,641 --> 01:02:34,652
Speaker 0: So don't learn any other layout besides QWERTY.

867
01:02:35,233 --> 01:02:36,477
Speaker 0: It's not worth it.

868
01:02:36,657 --> 01:02:37,660
Speaker 0: It's just stupid.

869
01:02:38,001 --> 01:02:41,491
Speaker 1: Maybe a zerty but only if that's you know, the style of your area.

870
01:02:41,511 --> 01:02:57,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know learn your local keyboard and you know because I mean most people listening to this podcast know English because we're speaking in English and English is sort of becoming the language up to internets, you know, I mean most programming languages are in English.

871
01:02:57,881 --> 01:03:05,340
Speaker 0: You know, it's just the sad reality that you know, the not so great language I mean, it's not the worst language, but there are better languages.

872
01:03:05,862 --> 01:03:09,860
Speaker 0: But this is the one that won because the United States has the most money and the most guns.

873
01:03:10,081 --> 01:03:10,584
Speaker 1: I am curious.

874
01:03:10,624 --> 01:03:12,535
Speaker 1: What is a better language than English?

875
01:03:12,595 --> 01:03:23,709
Speaker 0: Yeah Loge bond Loge bond Esperanto not Esperanto.

876
01:03:24,231 --> 01:03:29,237
