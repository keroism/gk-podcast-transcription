00:00:11,034 --> 00:00:11,736
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

00:00:12,097 --> 00:00:12,798
Speaker 1: I'm red.

00:00:12,838 --> 00:00:17,770
Speaker 0: This is geek knives tonight the curse of the unknown.

5
00:00:22,191 --> 00:00:26,810
Speaker 1: Actually, it's spell of the unknown or Lord of the unknown tower.

6
00:00:27,472 --> 00:00:28,415
Speaker 0: Wait, wait, wait Lord.

00:00:28,435 --> 00:00:32,167
Speaker 0: Is that was that like the Japanese title what they changed the title even?

8
00:00:32,228 --> 00:00:32,488
Speaker 0: Yep.

9
00:00:32,749 --> 00:00:37,384
Speaker 0: Fuck Alright, well guess what to discuss that after news is and whatnots and all that crap.

10
00:00:37,846 --> 00:00:38,889
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

11
00:00:40,751 --> 00:00:45,530
Speaker 0: So why are you tricking me by thinking making me think I'm doing the opening bit but we're still doing the opener?

12
00:00:45,932 --> 00:00:48,866
Speaker 1: I did not at any point say anything like that.

13
00:00:48,987 --> 00:00:54,465
Speaker 0: I simply Manipulated the natural flow of five years of routine.

14
00:00:54,605 --> 00:01:02,330
Speaker 1: I was about to hit a Psychological trap and I simply pointed out that you'd gotten the name of the movie we watched and are going to review incorrect.

15
00:01:02,792 --> 00:01:06,347
Speaker 0: I'll have to trick you by making it seem like a thing of the day is coming.

16
00:01:06,387 --> 00:01:11,930
Speaker 0: But oh shit The thing is I have the power of post-production.

17
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:14,522
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you get everything.

18
00:01:14,582 --> 00:01:15,770
Speaker 0: I say you're just gonna make it.

19
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,890
Speaker 0: You know make me say like I'm stupid over and over again or something.

20
00:01:19,373 --> 00:01:22,249
Speaker 1: If I was really gonna do it, I would just auto-tune you and only you.

21
00:01:23,271 --> 00:01:23,892
Speaker 0: It's not too bad.

22
00:01:23,913 --> 00:01:26,499
Speaker 0: It depends what song you get.

23
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,241
Speaker 0: auto-tune me to.

24
00:01:27,783 --> 00:01:30,290
Speaker 1: I'll just auto-tune you to whatever note you're closest to.

25
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:34,216
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah Maybe some sort of Dorian mode.

26
00:01:34,738 --> 00:01:35,681
Speaker 1: But anyway, it's Wednesday.

27
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:36,423
Speaker 0: It's anime.

28
00:01:36,785 --> 00:01:38,370
Speaker 1: There's usually not much anime news.

29
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:44,827
Speaker 1: We try to avoid all the stories about the anime industry collapsing or the anime industry not doing well.

30
00:01:44,847 --> 00:01:45,990
Speaker 0: They're all the same story.

31
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:51,329
Speaker 0: Yeah But anyway, there's this big story going around about the manga industry not doing so.

32
00:01:53,953 --> 00:01:58,709
Speaker 0: Basically What this comes down to is there are 36 publishers, right?

33
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,590
Speaker 0: American and Japanese mostly Japanese manga publishers.

34
00:02:03,112 --> 00:02:09,150
Speaker 0: All the big ones are included in a whole bunch of small ones and they've created a coalition against scan lation.

35
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,470
Speaker 0: I always thought it was scans lation, but I guess everyone calls it scan lation.

36
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:17,289
Speaker 1: Maybe maybe it's a cultural shift like OVA versus OAV?

37
00:02:17,511 --> 00:02:18,656
Speaker 1: I don't know.

38
00:02:18,676 --> 00:02:21,249
Speaker 1: I like a lot of 90s anime fans call them OAVs.

39
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:26,070
Speaker 0: I'm a fan of scans lation, but I guess I'll use scan lation as long as that's what's in this article.

40
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,980
Speaker 1: But basically I'm gonna keep saying scans lation.

41
00:02:29,421 --> 00:02:36,649
Speaker 0: Yeah from what I've been able to tell from you know, manga people I follow on Twitter and people who've you know work for manga companies even like the.

42
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:51,969
Speaker 0: you know Kurt hassler the guy who's like the king of the US manga industry and all right It's basically they all seem to agree that like scan lation is horrible evil and it's like the bane of everything right, and it's that's why manga is failing and such.

43
00:02:51,989 --> 00:03:00,961
Speaker 0: and I'm just gonna say, you know, I don't want to go too long on this because we've said it about a thousand times But it's the same story over and over again.

44
00:03:01,563 --> 00:03:03,230
Speaker 0: First of all is complete bullshit.

45
00:03:03,572 --> 00:03:06,830
Speaker 0: They've had 15 years to do everyone every publisher of anything.

46
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,981
Speaker 0: Is it 15 years to do something about the internet?

47
00:03:09,342 --> 00:03:10,086
Speaker 0: and they've done nothing.

48
00:03:10,448 --> 00:03:12,415
Speaker 1: and you know I don't want to say what I always say.

49
00:03:12,475 --> 00:03:15,605
Speaker 1: so I'll abbreviate it take fucking kozuokoke's golf.

50
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,230
Speaker 1: Manga put it in Golf Digest.

51
00:03:17,491 --> 00:03:20,406
Speaker 1: You'll make manga popular among 40 year old guys in America.

52
00:03:20,627 --> 00:03:24,670
Speaker 1: Yep done It's such a sure thing anyway.

53
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:29,984
Speaker 0: Anyway, but yeah if they get rid of see the thing is they're really upset about scans lation.

54
00:03:30,004 --> 00:03:38,690
Speaker 0: because like you can go on Google and search for Manga and like in the top 1000 sites Like there are these scan lation sites that even have like scans of American stuff and it right.

55
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,550
Speaker 1: That's how I read death note back when it wasn't available anywhere.

56
00:03:41,813 --> 00:03:48,755
Speaker 0: Yeah, right and you know The thing is what I have like death note or even thought about buying it without that scans lation I would have never even noticed it.

57
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:49,799
Speaker 0: No, but I bought it all.

58
00:03:50,723 --> 00:03:53,786
Speaker 0: if they get rid of these scan lation sites You know what's gonna happen, huh?

59
00:03:54,771 --> 00:03:55,114
Speaker 1: Wait, wait.

60
00:03:55,377 --> 00:04:03,486
Speaker 1: two options one Piracy disappears and overnight the manga industry in America becomes a multi-billion dollar industry.

61
00:04:03,507 --> 00:04:06,978
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm or or pretty much.

62
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:14,930
Speaker 0: what's gonna happen is Sales will stay the same or decrease and readership will decrease.

63
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:16,113
Speaker 1: That's all they will.

64
00:04:16,254 --> 00:04:19,444
Speaker 0: all they will achieve is making manga less popular.

65
00:04:19,745 --> 00:04:22,634
Speaker 0: the punk kids reading it for free Have no money.

66
00:04:23,035 --> 00:04:24,239
Speaker 0: if they do have money.

67
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,225
Speaker 0: They ain't spending it on manga.

68
00:04:26,546 --> 00:04:27,068
Speaker 1: Well, of course.

69
00:04:27,108 --> 00:04:27,730
Speaker 1: now, what are they gonna do?

70
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:33,970
Speaker 0: They're gonna go to Walden books or well I guess Walden book and say in the aisle and even if they do buy one They'll trade it with each other.

71
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,834
Speaker 0: You know everybody.

72
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:38,932
Speaker 0: or they'll buy in the discount bin or you know, if they had a zillion dollars They would buy it.

73
00:04:38,992 --> 00:04:40,639
Speaker 1: I mean manga cow is a stereotype.

74
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:41,080
Speaker 1: for a reason.

75
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:47,321
Speaker 1: you go to any bookstore even today despite the Unpopularity of most manga and the whole collapse the industry.

76
00:04:47,723 --> 00:04:49,490
Speaker 1: They're just punk kids sitting there reading it all.

77
00:04:49,530 --> 00:05:02,230
Speaker 0: They just sit there and read Naruto one, two, three, four, five six seven while their parents and then Come back to the bookstore eight nine ten or they go to the library Libraries get you some sales because the library buys their copy, you know.

78
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:18,990
Speaker 0: so I think that pretty much the only way that they can make money if they insist on selling books made of paper and Insist on DRM and all that kind of stuff is to make all the mangas a dollar like a dollar a volume because you know What the kid will go to the bookstore and he'll see all these volumes for a dollar.

79
00:05:19,493 --> 00:05:20,982
Speaker 1: Actually, I think a better way to make money.

80
00:05:21,022 --> 00:05:21,384
Speaker 1: and why?

81
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:25,218
Speaker 1: to this day I cannot understand why people don't do this in America.

82
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:26,121
Speaker 1: They always seem to say.

83
00:05:26,181 --> 00:05:29,050
Speaker 1: All right, we've got this market this demographic.

84
00:05:29,192 --> 00:05:30,168
Speaker 1: We're gonna shoot for it.

85
00:05:30,451 --> 00:05:38,430
Speaker 1: The demographic is people with no fucking money Infinite free time and the ability to pirate whatever they want also no scruples.

86
00:05:39,614 --> 00:05:41,108
Speaker 1: So that is what they go after.

87
00:05:41,932 --> 00:05:42,975
Speaker 1: That is the demographic.

88
00:05:43,015 --> 00:05:47,728
Speaker 1: They say you know what fuck rim and Scott the 30 year old tool to spend money to get a comic.

89
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:50,809
Speaker 1: fuck 40 year old rich guys who like golf.

90
00:05:51,411 --> 00:05:55,621
Speaker 1: We're gonna go after the least viable demographic their fucking is.

91
00:05:55,641 --> 00:05:59,009
Speaker 1: and then we're gonna complain when we don't make any money.

92
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:00,973
Speaker 0: Are they like?

93
00:06:01,896 --> 00:06:03,039
Speaker 1: are they just stupid.

94
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:11,170
Speaker 0: the problem is they go after us right and all of the us is by it But there's only a hundred of us is yeah, that's why they fail that way to know because it's a game of marketing.

95
00:06:11,311 --> 00:06:17,990
Speaker 1: You cannot tell me that they just took Kazuo Koike's golf manga the example I always use and just put it in golf digest.

96
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:20,463
Speaker 0: It's a lot of money to get in golf digest.

97
00:06:20,805 --> 00:06:24,590
Speaker 0: if you have enough money to get Digest you have enough money to be golf died.

98
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:25,833
Speaker 1: Digest.

99
00:06:25,873 --> 00:06:26,435
Speaker 1: we're smart.

100
00:06:26,897 --> 00:06:30,490
Speaker 1: they would do it and they would make all the money from the sales of this.

101
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,385
Speaker 0: But then what is the manga publisher get?

102
00:06:32,506 --> 00:06:32,950
Speaker 0: fuck them?

103
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, see the thing is golf digest has to hire the manga car and while the publisher still fuck.

104
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,877
Speaker 0: So what's the publisher supposed to do?

105
00:06:38,957 --> 00:06:46,629
Speaker 0: Well publishers are basically obsolete in the money Middleman no longer necessary if you're a middleman.

106
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,198
Speaker 1: They serve a very valuable purpose.

107
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:56,607
Speaker 1: if you are completely unaware of the world around you Publishers will feed you stuff and charge you money for it.

108
00:06:56,627 --> 00:07:02,023
Speaker 0: Yes All middlemen Basically, you're all dead.

109
00:07:02,124 --> 00:07:03,352
Speaker 0: give up now Don't you know?

110
00:07:03,412 --> 00:07:04,839
Speaker 0: all they're doing is they?

111
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:12,384
Speaker 0: I think the big problem is is just Economically speaking any company that actually has something going on has a slow death, right?

112
00:07:12,564 --> 00:07:16,386
Speaker 0: These companies actually died years ago You know, they already are dead.

113
00:07:16,487 --> 00:07:20,078
Speaker 1: Oh my She popularized zombie.

114
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:25,743
Speaker 0: their corpses continue to move Yes, but they're not completely dead until they actually go bankrupt.

115
00:07:25,783 --> 00:07:26,085
Speaker 0: So what?

116
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,490
Speaker 1: mostly dead right?

117
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,609
Speaker 0: It's you know, Ken sure goes what and they go.

118
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:37,130
Speaker 0: Oh, no, and then but they don't explode for like a few sec No instead they said in this case is that a few seconds as a few years they reflect on the crimes of their life.

119
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,179
Speaker 1: Well, they walk slowly backwards over a cliff.

120
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,143
Speaker 0: So they keep trying.

121
00:07:40,163 --> 00:07:41,830
Speaker 0: they don't realize they're dead, right?

122
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:48,755
Speaker 0: So they keep trying to like, you know do something to revive or come back to life and they complain about oh We're going downhill.

123
00:07:48,795 --> 00:07:49,820
Speaker 0: But you know why.

124
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,950
Speaker 0: you know, we do this then we won't be going downhill anymore.

125
00:07:52,051 --> 00:07:53,098
Speaker 0: No, you're already dead.

126
00:07:53,461 --> 00:07:54,649
Speaker 0: There's nothing that you can do.

127
00:07:55,151 --> 00:07:56,275
Speaker 0: It's too late you can't?

128
00:07:56,295 --> 00:07:59,586
Speaker 0: you're already got you in the late 90s when Napster came out.

129
00:08:00,007 --> 00:08:01,873
Speaker 0: if you didn't do something That was your only chance.

130
00:08:01,893 --> 00:08:03,418
Speaker 0: you can walk over the counter.

131
00:08:03,739 --> 00:08:07,470
Speaker 0: You couldn't counter like the moose or a 10 say so that you know.

132
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,796
Speaker 1: Not that you can know.

133
00:08:10,418 --> 00:08:10,840
Speaker 0: that was it.

134
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,101
Speaker 0: there was.

135
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:18,007
Speaker 0: you could have countered attacked at that moment But it hit you and that's it Ken sure just walked by the building and that was.

136
00:08:18,027 --> 00:08:20,074
Speaker 0: that was Years ago.

137
00:08:20,094 --> 00:08:23,103
Speaker 0: Napster is from like 98 99, you know, what's funny.

138
00:08:23,243 --> 00:08:25,410
Speaker 0: remember the nap like it's like over ten years ago.

139
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:38,476
Speaker 1: I remember when Napster first became popular and you know a girl in my high school came up to me because everyone knew I was like the tech guy and she was like So, um, you know, I use Napster to get these files and they don't play that well That was some buffering issue.

140
00:08:38,496 --> 00:08:42,351
Speaker 1: Like I knew where the problem was, but I remember thinking Napster.

141
00:08:42,792 --> 00:08:48,069
Speaker 1: only stupid people use Napster because that was still when mp3 sites were the way to get mp3.

142
00:08:48,691 --> 00:08:49,393
Speaker 0: No, they were.

143
00:08:49,573 --> 00:08:55,150
Speaker 0: as soon as Napster existed mp3 sites were no longer a couple weeks before Napster was really usable.

144
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:55,913
Speaker 0: No, it was.

145
00:08:56,013 --> 00:08:57,358
Speaker 0: it was pretty good right out of the gate.

146
00:08:57,439 --> 00:09:00,390
Speaker 0: even on a 56 came out of mine was rocking like discographies.

147
00:09:00,992 --> 00:09:05,690
Speaker 1: Thing is that like Napster was well and good but it was really the win mx days where I got most of my music.

148
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,337
Speaker 0: Well, that's just because you know, it wasn't.

149
00:09:07,357 --> 00:09:10,469
Speaker 0: if we had Napster at RIT would have been way better than win mx.

150
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,144
Speaker 1: Yeah I think is direct connected.

151
00:09:12,245 --> 00:09:17,828
Speaker 1: RIT Owned it all because we basically had access to all media ever created on a local land that no one could even peer into.

152
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:21,498
Speaker 0: Yep Anyway, the that is the demographic.

153
00:09:21,518 --> 00:09:27,850
Speaker 1: They're trying to make money out of selling physical media - yeah Try something else guys and ain't give me DRM either.

154
00:09:28,513 --> 00:09:30,886
Speaker 1: So I feel like I should talk about this.

155
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:36,712
Speaker 1: Scott will groan But I got to talk about a little bit because a lot of people are speculating and I have a little bit of insight I can.

156
00:09:36,772 --> 00:09:37,214
Speaker 1: I will not.

157
00:09:37,355 --> 00:09:46,549
Speaker 1: I will not right now speak on behalf of Otacon But if you haven't noticed Otacon has not sent out any panel Stuff yet at all.

158
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,935
Speaker 1: They haven't scheduled anything.

159
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:51,429
Speaker 1: and you know Scott and I are both panel staff and we don't know any more than you do.

160
00:09:51,811 --> 00:09:52,393
Speaker 0: We know nothing.

161
00:09:52,613 --> 00:09:58,939
Speaker 1: the email that you all you panel has got is the exact same email the sent to us the staff Mm-hmm.

162
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,730
Speaker 1: So I'll be straight up with all of you.

163
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,940
Speaker 1: We don't even know if we're gonna go to Otacon because they haven't.

164
00:10:03,242 --> 00:10:03,724
Speaker 0: it's not.

165
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:04,970
Speaker 0: it's looking unlikely.

166
00:10:05,351 --> 00:10:07,318
Speaker 0: I mean, I've been to Otacon every year since 2002 Otacon.

167
00:10:07,338 --> 00:10:13,298
Speaker 0: Oh - that's went to Five six seven eight nine.

168
00:10:13,318 --> 00:10:17,451
Speaker 1: So I've been to eight Otacon's in a row when we went to our first Otacon One.

169
00:10:17,693 --> 00:10:20,466
Speaker 1: violent late-night movies were not our tradition yet.

170
00:10:20,747 --> 00:10:26,648
Speaker 0: Yep Para-para was genuinely popular among anime fans and brand new hotness.

171
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:30,319
Speaker 1: Yep There was a para-para like summit at that con.

172
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,142
Speaker 1: We went to.

173
00:10:31,202 --> 00:10:31,603
Speaker 0: Full Metal.

174
00:10:31,684 --> 00:10:33,790
Speaker 0: Alchemist was not yet existing.

175
00:10:33,911 --> 00:10:41,541
Speaker 1: Yeah, the hot anime at the time was I don't even know - wasn't that like when?

176
00:10:41,561 --> 00:10:46,187
Speaker 1: I don't even know I didn't care I don't even remember was watching like initial D?

177
00:10:47,711 --> 00:10:50,101
Speaker 0: It was there and I think there was initial D at the time.

178
00:10:50,121 --> 00:10:51,146
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

179
00:10:51,246 --> 00:10:52,190
Speaker 1: Here's the biggest difference.

180
00:10:52,571 --> 00:10:53,815
Speaker 1: There was an anime industry.

181
00:10:53,835 --> 00:10:56,946
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think was Gundam seed was the next year, right?

182
00:10:56,966 --> 00:10:57,568
Speaker 1: That was later.

183
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:58,150
Speaker 0: Let me see.

184
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,014
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, no cuz.

185
00:10:59,054 --> 00:11:00,341
Speaker 1: yeah, TMR was the next year.

186
00:11:00,421 --> 00:11:02,009
Speaker 1: So yeah, I think.

187
00:11:02,049 --> 00:11:05,230
Speaker 1: so I remember that was the Otacon where we entered that contest.

188
00:11:05,571 --> 00:11:10,650
Speaker 1: We signed the forms that the booth babes gave us to win the car full of anime.

189
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:14,790
Speaker 0: That was a TV when they were before, you know, yeah, it's such a different world.

190
00:11:15,712 --> 00:11:17,630
Speaker 1: But you know, I really want to go to Otacon.

191
00:11:17,853 --> 00:11:39,669
Speaker 1: I enjoy you know Every time I think about going to Otacon The first thing I remember is that line sucks and the line alone would be a reason not to go to Otacon that Thursday line Or even worse the Friday line, but we've skipped that line every year either due to you know old rules that no longer exist in Otacon like panelists skip the line or Straight up just cheating and skipping the line and lying and getting a badge.

192
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,650
Speaker 1: But if I had to stand in that line, I would have stopped going to Otacon a long time ago.

193
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,795
Speaker 1: But that's all beside the point.

194
00:11:45,815 --> 00:11:49,894
Speaker 1: I Don't do any panels.

195
00:11:49,934 --> 00:11:51,581
Speaker 1: I feel like there's no point in going.

196
00:11:51,983 --> 00:11:52,967
Speaker 0: Yeah, why would I?

197
00:11:53,027 --> 00:11:55,335
Speaker 0: you know, it's weird I have this I'm torn right?

198
00:11:55,395 --> 00:11:55,716
Speaker 0: It's like.

199
00:11:56,138 --> 00:12:00,130
Speaker 0: part of the reason of not going is simply our personal situation, right?

200
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,136
Speaker 0: It's like I'm in New York City now.

201
00:12:02,397 --> 00:12:03,701
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have no car.

202
00:12:04,644 --> 00:12:06,590
Speaker 0: I have to use a bunch of vacation days.

203
00:12:07,051 --> 00:12:08,737
Speaker 0: That's a lot of hassle waiting in line.

204
00:12:08,757 --> 00:12:12,390
Speaker 0: Is it you know, so those are the personal hassles, you know, my situation has changed.

205
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:18,470
Speaker 1: Yeah Was it was like it was just above this line before we didn't have cars anymore.

206
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,976
Speaker 1: Now it's just below this line.

207
00:12:20,257 --> 00:12:25,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, you know, so now because of the change in my life It is far more difficult to Otacon.

208
00:12:25,171 --> 00:12:31,129
Speaker 0: so Otacon has to be that much better for me to go to it but at the same but it's sort of the same and Actually, it's a little less than it used to be.

209
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:36,777
Speaker 1: Well, here's the reason I think the only less for me because a lot of things are better like remember That's a rocker go panel last year.

210
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:37,923
Speaker 0: Is it actually coming?

211
00:12:37,943 --> 00:12:38,767
Speaker 0: Is it come back for real?

212
00:12:38,787 --> 00:12:41,301
Speaker 1: It's coming back And I was like 100% sure it's come back.

213
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:45,702
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're staff, you know I guess you didn't go to the meeting where we talked about that.

214
00:12:45,742 --> 00:12:47,490
Speaker 0: But yeah, is that public information?

215
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,615
Speaker 0: I don't know if you should be saying that.

216
00:12:48,796 --> 00:12:51,990
Speaker 0: I don't I don't even care anymore, but they might sue you or something.

217
00:12:52,931 --> 00:12:54,678
Speaker 1: Nope, they didn't make me sign an NDA.

218
00:12:55,421 --> 00:12:55,963
Speaker 0: Oh, I guess not.

219
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,068
Speaker 0: Did you sign an NDA?

220
00:12:57,228 --> 00:12:59,162
Speaker 0: I don't know I didn't I didn't sign anything.

221
00:12:59,182 --> 00:13:06,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, so hey They might kick me off the staff But I haven't even done anything.

222
00:13:06,241 --> 00:13:08,530
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm gonna be honest with all of you and I hate to rag on Otacon.

223
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:14,489
Speaker 1: I've sent several emails basically to you know, the staff above me asking Hey, what do you want me to do?

224
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:20,330
Speaker 1: We're panel staff will help you with the panels that are obviously way behind and we have yet to get a response.

225
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:21,307
Speaker 1: I've just far as I know.

226
00:13:21,751 --> 00:13:27,110
Speaker 1: The only reason I know I'm still on the staff is that I get the general staff emails like here's the whole thing.

227
00:13:27,672 --> 00:13:30,704
Speaker 0: That's just a computerized thing right is they have a staff system.

228
00:13:30,885 --> 00:13:31,949
Speaker 0: We're entered into it.

229
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:37,164
Speaker 0: Yeah, right and therefore we get you can log into it and we get staff emails.

230
00:13:37,225 --> 00:13:39,030
Speaker 1: We're still listed as panel staff.

231
00:13:39,534 --> 00:13:41,066
Speaker 1: We're on the list of those people.

232
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:49,410
Speaker 1: Yeah But just staff stuff aside The things that we've gotten worse about Otacon is pretty much the Thursday line and the Friday line.

233
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:49,571
Speaker 1: Like.

234
00:13:49,591 --> 00:13:52,009
Speaker 1: they've been worse every year for the past several years.

235
00:13:52,351 --> 00:13:54,761
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I remember, you know the entire front row.

236
00:13:54,781 --> 00:14:03,790
Speaker 0: we used to tell people that give them advice like hey Just get in the Thursday night line, you know After like, you know eight o'clock, so then it'll already be died down.

237
00:14:04,412 --> 00:14:09,330
Speaker 0: It didn't die down last year two years ago three years ago that advice was alright.

238
00:14:09,671 --> 00:14:17,670
Speaker 1: And the people who are friends who couldn't get through the line on Thursday they got into the Friday line and I didn't know how bad that line was.

239
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:24,810
Speaker 1: Like I assumed it was an hour or two But it is basically like it itself outweighs all the fun of Otacon to stand in that line.

240
00:14:25,111 --> 00:14:31,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you know, the thing is I think about being an Otacon like ah that building I've been there eight times the Otter Bean Lobby.

241
00:14:32,131 --> 00:14:41,290
Speaker 1: I'm going to see a late-night violent movie Standing in line to get my wristband turn to the person behind me and saying hey you're going to see Tokyo Gore police.

242
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,478
Speaker 1: He's like nah, I'm going to see the hentai whatever.

243
00:14:43,498 --> 00:14:45,205
Speaker 1: Yeah, those are good times.

244
00:14:45,366 --> 00:14:53,408
Speaker 0: There's a lot of good times We have a lot of friends, but and I want to have those good times, but I don't want to drive real far I don't want to wait in line and I don't want to deal with BS.

245
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,850
Speaker 0: Well, the other thing is a lot of money to stay in those hotels.

246
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:00,490
Speaker 1: The entire front row crew has bailed on us on Otacon this year.

247
00:15:01,012 --> 00:15:03,124
Speaker 1: In fact, this is the first there's not a single person.

248
00:15:03,144 --> 00:15:06,409
Speaker 0: Oh Johnson was saying he wanted to go.

249
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:12,719
Speaker 1: He's one of the only ones I think Judith and Natalie and maybe James and Lisa but the whole rest of our crew Not going to Otacon.

250
00:15:13,001 --> 00:15:20,565
Speaker 1: and I remember I won't name any names But when this first came to light one of our friends was like, yeah I've been going to Otacon for almost a decade and I just I'm not going this year.

251
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:21,610
Speaker 1: and I was like what the fuck why?

252
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:22,431
Speaker 1: We're going.

253
00:15:22,471 --> 00:15:25,781
Speaker 1: we got the hotel room and everything and he said and I quote rim.

254
00:15:26,182 --> 00:15:28,047
Speaker 1: You've never stood in that fucking line.

255
00:15:28,348 --> 00:15:28,749
Speaker 1: Fuck you.

256
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:35,075
Speaker 1: And now that I see what that lines like like that alone They just mail the badges.

257
00:15:35,115 --> 00:15:35,457
Speaker 1: I'd go.

258
00:15:35,738 --> 00:15:37,023
Speaker 0: Yeah, they mailed the badges.

259
00:15:37,063 --> 00:15:38,630
Speaker 0: that would put it slightly above the line.

260
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:52,990
Speaker 1: but there's kind of a meta reason why we really I hate to pull this sort of stuff because you know doing panels and being like staff and guests of cons is Not something the majority of you deal with and it's a whole different world and you probably don't care about this.

261
00:15:53,070 --> 00:16:00,892
Speaker 0: Yeah, this makes no difference in the calculation of an average attendee of whether or not to go but anime Boston pays us to Panels.

262
00:16:01,173 --> 00:16:03,862
Speaker 1: the New York Anime Festival and comic-con basically ask us.

263
00:16:04,143 --> 00:16:06,110
Speaker 1: Hey, what panels do you want to do?

264
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,455
Speaker 1: When do you want to do them?

265
00:16:07,515 --> 00:16:08,943
Speaker 1: Let's go packs.

266
00:16:09,204 --> 00:16:20,129
Speaker 0: They treat us like royalty cooperates with us like a year in advance to coordinate and Like we discuss logistics of all sorts of panels and all this kind of stuff.

267
00:16:20,531 --> 00:16:23,919
Speaker 0: Constant communication months and months and months in advance.

268
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:27,047
Speaker 0: We've already all kinds of stuff our packs East panels.

269
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:29,093
Speaker 1: That is like April 2011.

270
00:16:29,093 --> 00:16:31,310
Speaker 0: yeah, we don't even know when they haven't announced it yet.

271
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:47,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, and meanwhile, we've already talked about things as specific as like video recording of those panels right, so Like Otakon hasn't even the Otakon's real soon and they haven't even emailed us to say what panels were doing.

272
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:56,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there's other issues that are semi private But we I'd say there's only about a 30% chance that we're actually going to be able to attend Otakon this year.

273
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,642
Speaker 1: This might be the end for us.

274
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:06,589
Speaker 0: If I could like just teleport there and skip the line and do a couple panels, dude I would pay a large amount of money to skip the line.

275
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:10,244
Speaker 1: Maybe I should pay some punk kid to stand in the line for me if we end up not being.

276
00:17:10,285 --> 00:17:12,097
Speaker 0: just take your badge though And your money.

277
00:17:12,258 --> 00:17:12,784
Speaker 0: then what do you do?

278
00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:16,210
Speaker 0: And you need to show photo ID, right?

279
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:18,732
Speaker 1: Doesn't matter.

280
00:17:18,832 --> 00:17:20,539
Speaker 1: once you get the badge it doesn't matter.

281
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,489
Speaker 1: I'll just find some kid and be like, here's 500 bucks Give me your goddamn badge.

282
00:17:26,911 --> 00:17:31,890
Speaker 0: Well, here's what you really want to do you you you basically get some kid put him in line, right?

283
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:45,450
Speaker 0: And then you you set you find some way that he will swap in out of the line for you And then he gets out of the line because you paid him to get out of the line But the people nearby won't be complaining, you know.

284
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:50,150
Speaker 0: And you do it before you get to the part of the line with the staff there Right, like just around the corner from the entrance.

285
00:17:50,651 --> 00:17:58,729
Speaker 0: So, you know, basically you only have to wait in this tiny acceptable line and the people around him are like We don't care if you cut because you just swap this kid out.

286
00:17:58,932 --> 00:18:00,290
Speaker 1: He's at the back of the line.

287
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:08,632
Speaker 1: I I feel like if we really wanted to we could pull the same bullshit We pulled for the last several years and just kind of worm our way in and then get our badges without having to wait In line.

288
00:18:08,892 --> 00:18:15,796
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably it just it bothers me that Otakon is the only con where I have to basically fake it to avoid the Line that prevents me from getting the panel.

289
00:18:15,837 --> 00:18:16,358
Speaker 1: I have to do.

290
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:17,683
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like Otakon.

291
00:18:17,744 --> 00:18:19,330
Speaker 0: why you know, they want me.

292
00:18:19,751 --> 00:18:29,180
Speaker 0: I assume that they want me to come down there right and do panels for them and You know say good things about their con on our show.

293
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:36,150
Speaker 0: Not that we're that popular anything But I assume that they want that right but they make it as difficult as possible.

294
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:41,930
Speaker 0: Why should I spend a ton of money take vacation days and go through extensive travel and wait in a long line?

295
00:18:42,411 --> 00:18:46,294
Speaker 0: You know, it's like I'm not working for you You're supposed to.

296
00:18:46,394 --> 00:18:48,140
Speaker 0: it's the other way around right?

297
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:50,690
Speaker 0: every other con every single one even tiny ones.

298
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,794
Speaker 0: It's the other way around.

299
00:18:51,814 --> 00:18:53,400
Speaker 1: Yeah magfest, you know, awesome.

300
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,310
Speaker 0: They've been your best tiny little con, right?

301
00:18:56,531 --> 00:18:58,538
Speaker 0: Around the same geographic area as Otakon.

302
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:00,826
Speaker 0: They're like, please come to us.

303
00:19:00,966 --> 00:19:02,090
Speaker 0: We will kiss your feet.

304
00:19:02,211 --> 00:19:03,639
Speaker 0: It's like a couple thousand people.

305
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:07,558
Speaker 0: and they're like, oh, please come to us from far away We will make your a good time for you.

306
00:19:07,578 --> 00:19:08,964
Speaker 0: Otakon is so big.

307
00:19:09,004 --> 00:19:11,769
Speaker 0: It's like yeah, fuck you Let's see what you what can you do for me?

308
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:14,450
Speaker 0: And I'm like, I'm not gonna do anything for you if you're gonna be like that.

309
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:19,670
Speaker 1: Oh, that's the worst thing cuz you know, we've done like 30 Otakon panels in the last several years.

310
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:20,877
Speaker 0: Yeah, we got eight Otakons.

311
00:19:20,897 --> 00:19:23,048
Speaker 0: We've done panels at pretty much all of them Otakon.

312
00:19:23,471 --> 00:19:28,449
Speaker 1: We did I think seven panels in a row like just Friday and Saturday.

313
00:19:28,469 --> 00:19:31,290
Speaker 1: those women They even asked us to do extra panels at the con.

314
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:33,423
Speaker 0: Who was the panel runner that year?

315
00:19:33,443 --> 00:19:35,889
Speaker 1: Ah Was it Omar?

316
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:38,535
Speaker 1: Meredith is awesome.

317
00:19:38,615 --> 00:19:39,498
Speaker 1: Omar is awesome.

318
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:42,086
Speaker 0: Meredith is head of all programming now, right?

319
00:19:42,287 --> 00:19:43,170
Speaker 1: I think I think she's.

320
00:19:43,674 --> 00:19:49,141
Speaker 1: She won the election to be Like stat one of the at large positions.

321
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:49,904
Speaker 0: Yeah, she's like.

322
00:19:49,944 --> 00:19:50,687
Speaker 0: she's like upper.

323
00:19:50,767 --> 00:19:55,406
Speaker 0: She just moved up So but she left the vacancy Which was not filled.

324
00:19:55,588 --> 00:20:02,010
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, it was filled and the as far as I can tell the guy who was in charge of our panels department isn't in charge anymore.

325
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:08,379
Speaker 1: But no one told us until I emailed the entire panels department asking like hey So are we gonna schedule anything?

326
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:13,008
Speaker 1: and they're like, oh, yeah, I'm in charge of panels now And we don't need you to do anything just yet.

327
00:20:13,732 --> 00:20:14,475
Speaker 0: What do you want me to do?

328
00:20:14,516 --> 00:20:15,219
Speaker 0: because you know what.

329
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:23,723
Speaker 0: if even if I show up at the con if you say hey You know sit in these panel rooms and you know Make sure the panels follow the rules and fill out these piece of paper.

330
00:20:23,743 --> 00:20:25,150
Speaker 0: I'm like, uh, no, I didn't.

331
00:20:26,131 --> 00:20:30,270
Speaker 0: You obviously did not read the communications from when we originally became staff.

332
00:20:30,892 --> 00:20:32,278
Speaker 1: So we'll see I don't.

333
00:20:32,358 --> 00:20:39,110
Speaker 1: I mean Otacon is all is fun and it's a good anime con But I worry that it just we can't deal with it anymore.

334
00:20:39,211 --> 00:20:43,131
Speaker 1: It takes so much more work to do and they never even let us do the awesome panels We have.

335
00:20:43,151 --> 00:20:46,430
Speaker 1: they've never let us run our good anime panels.

336
00:20:46,651 --> 00:20:50,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, we offer them all these high-quality panels and they always ask for like the advance Wars panel.

337
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,723
Speaker 0: That was the year we did the seven panels anime.

338
00:20:52,743 --> 00:20:55,870
Speaker 1: You should see like Phil's multi-thousand person rooms.

339
00:20:56,891 --> 00:20:57,537
Speaker 0: attention do they?

340
00:20:57,597 --> 00:21:04,270
Speaker 1: not even of Course they let us do beyond Dungeons & Dragons that one year to fill the biggest panel room like yeah handily.

341
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:05,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

342
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:06,489
Speaker 0: They're not even paying attention.

343
00:21:06,711 --> 00:21:11,965
Speaker 0: they don't even realize that that we fill the room for them and reduced all that traffic in the rest of the.

344
00:21:12,026 --> 00:21:15,707
Speaker 0: you know, In the far-off Hilton most people didn't know how to get to yep.

345
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:16,892
Speaker 1: That was actually.

346
00:21:16,953 --> 00:21:22,010
Speaker 1: I felt really bad because Fred shot deserved much more attendance than he got versus what we have.

347
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,470
Speaker 0: We filled we we put our butts in the seats for him.

348
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:28,790
Speaker 0: But yeah, that's that's you know, that's the fucked up way of Otacon, but that's all I got.

349
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,659
Speaker 1: I mean, I just I don't know what's going on with Otacon.

350
00:21:30,719 --> 00:21:34,312
Speaker 1: We likely won't be attending I don't know.

351
00:21:34,332 --> 00:21:35,999
Speaker 0: I'd like to attend but they gotta.

352
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:40,079
Speaker 0: they gotta you know, grease the the streets a little bit You know, they can't use the streets.

353
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:45,639
Speaker 1: I think they did that in 2001 You know, they got to pave the way.

354
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,290
Speaker 0: they got to make it easy for us to go to Otacon.

355
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:51,450
Speaker 0: They can't be you know, they put up roadblocks make it hard for us to go there.

356
00:21:51,691 --> 00:21:54,090
Speaker 0: I'm just not gonna you know, don't put obstacles in my way.

357
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,561
Speaker 0: You got to make it easy for me to go.

358
00:21:55,863 --> 00:21:56,649
Speaker 0: make me want to go.

359
00:21:56,971 --> 00:22:04,799
Speaker 1: So I guess if there's any Otacon staff listening just tell us what's going on because we're staff and no one Responds to any of our email.

360
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:07,070
Speaker 0: we might have to start emailing like the highest ups.

361
00:22:07,211 --> 00:22:13,584
Speaker 0: I don't like one email to the highest up before we actually like, you know The thing is Sean and Jim and all them like.

362
00:22:13,644 --> 00:22:17,503
Speaker 1: I'm not wearing good terms with them But they're busy with you know, like Jim runs all the stuff.

363
00:22:17,523 --> 00:22:17,784
Speaker 0: Yeah.

364
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:18,025
Speaker 0: Yeah.

365
00:22:18,065 --> 00:22:19,090
Speaker 0: Jim is doing all the guest stuff.

366
00:22:19,191 --> 00:22:20,620
Speaker 0: He's doing a good job.

367
00:22:20,661 --> 00:22:21,224
Speaker 0: He's smart.

368
00:22:21,285 --> 00:22:22,010
Speaker 0: He knows what's up.

369
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:28,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, Otacon has the best guest relations department of any anime convention in America, but it's like it's not helping us out.

370
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:31,984
Speaker 1: Well, maybe because they're one of the only anime cons that doesn't just treat us as guests.

371
00:22:32,405 --> 00:22:34,774
Speaker 0: Yeah Maybe you know.

372
00:22:34,834 --> 00:22:45,399
Speaker 0: if you know, he has nothing to do with us in his guest relation role But he's the only person that like we know that will respond to us and doesn't you know We can guarantee is smart and in the business.

373
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,705
Speaker 0: Maybe we can email Meredith.

374
00:22:46,786 --> 00:22:47,248
Speaker 0: I don't know.

375
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:55,218
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, just be like trying to follow like the rules and like we're panel staff Unnamed person who I don't want to call out.

376
00:22:55,238 --> 00:22:59,195
Speaker 1: that is like in charge of panels as far as I can tell But I'm not really sure.

377
00:22:59,215 --> 00:23:02,907
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know who else is on the panels department anymore.

378
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:03,910
Speaker 0: Whatever we're done.

379
00:23:10,981 --> 00:23:14,754
Speaker 1: But anyway, that was mostly of a rant of us complaining we'll get right on to the fun stuff.

380
00:23:14,794 --> 00:23:17,523
Speaker 1: things of the day Oh shit.

381
00:23:17,584 --> 00:23:19,170
Speaker 1: This was posted by a listener.

382
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,174
Speaker 1: I think it was sale.

383
00:23:20,194 --> 00:23:21,458
Speaker 1: I forget who whoever it was.

384
00:23:21,479 --> 00:23:26,265
Speaker 1: I'm sorry I forget your name because I didn't look in the thread to get it But I went to our.

385
00:23:26,306 --> 00:23:31,473
Speaker 1: there's a thing of the day thread in the forum where people post like their own things of the day And I ignore it just because it's enormous.

386
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,268
Speaker 1: I don't have time to read it But I never look in there ever.

387
00:23:34,308 --> 00:23:36,439
Speaker 1: someone told me that there was a thing in there and I looked at it.

388
00:23:37,022 --> 00:23:46,860
Speaker 1: This sounds like it would be really boring Unless you're really a video gamer, which is why I'm making it a thing of the day for anything other than video games on Wednesdays.

389
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,342
Speaker 0: All right.

390
00:23:47,442 --> 00:23:53,905
Speaker 1: This is Japanese people playing Mario 64 and they have this weird challenge They get a one-up mushroom.

391
00:23:54,185 --> 00:23:58,940
Speaker 1: and in Mario 64 when a one-up mushroom comes out it flies at you and it hits you.

392
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:07,731
Speaker 0: And yeah They didn't want because they didn't want to make it difficult to get because in Mario reg original Mario Right a one-up would like fall down a hole or something to be like, haha That was awesome in a Mario game.

393
00:24:07,851 --> 00:24:08,676
Speaker 0: or it's 3d.

394
00:24:08,736 --> 00:24:09,380
Speaker 0: it's hard, you know.

395
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,931
Speaker 0: So you don't know which way the one-up mushrooms gonna go.

396
00:24:11,991 --> 00:24:15,525
Speaker 0: you might not even see it coming at you with a camera You know and that stuff.

397
00:24:15,907 --> 00:24:19,983
Speaker 0: so it just homes in on you and you get the one up if you find it cuz they're all Hidden anyway.

398
00:24:20,023 --> 00:24:26,429
Speaker 1: before there were achievements gamers who were dedicated would make their own Achievements like hey, can you guys pull off?

399
00:24:26,469 --> 00:24:29,440
Speaker 0: this crazy shit beats all the one but no swords.

400
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:35,973
Speaker 1: So the crazy shit here is activate a one-up mushroom Which moves at a constant rate through the mat.

401
00:24:36,314 --> 00:24:37,580
Speaker 1: it goes through all objects.

402
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:42,680
Speaker 1: It just goes in a straight line toward Mario through anything in this giant 3d mat.

403
00:24:43,322 --> 00:24:49,020
Speaker 1: Activate the one up and then run around the map and get all the red coins without letting that fucking one up touch you.

404
00:24:49,642 --> 00:24:55,660
Speaker 1: And that might sound like the most boring thing in the world, especially because the people playing it's in Japanese.

405
00:24:55,881 --> 00:24:57,428
Speaker 1: You probably don't even know what they're saying.

406
00:24:57,951 --> 00:24:58,895
Speaker 1: Just watch this video.

407
00:24:59,117 --> 00:24:59,518
Speaker 1: It's funny.

408
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,440
Speaker 1: It is surprisingly funny to watch.

409
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,926
Speaker 0: Yeah All he's doing is trying to get all red coins Before the one up mushroom grabs it.

410
00:25:06,946 --> 00:25:11,100
Speaker 1: and let me tell you that one up mushroom has never seemed more sinister to me.

411
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:16,820
Speaker 0: Like usually you'd want it to grab you but in this like but he decides no I don't want it to grab me and then it becomes awesome.

412
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:24,504
Speaker 1: But suddenly when you don't want it to grab you this constant unerring velocity through all objects toward you with no way to stop it It's really kind of scary.

413
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:26,253
Speaker 1: It's kind of like Watson in that other video.

414
00:25:26,755 --> 00:25:27,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe we should make a game.

415
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:37,200
Speaker 0: that's just that is you're a guy in a 3d area and It's like one two three go and then this thing just starts coming at you and it goes through walls.

416
00:25:37,322 --> 00:25:38,800
Speaker 0: And is you know all kinds of shit?

417
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,880
Speaker 1: I think no matter what you made it look like even if it was like Yotsuba smiling.

418
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:45,280
Speaker 1: You'd be scared of that shit after playing this game enough.

419
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,920
Speaker 0: Well anything cute becomes scary when it's like that.

420
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,775
Speaker 0: It just had to be sort of normal looking just like a normal looking do like it's a bread.

421
00:25:51,037 --> 00:25:51,620
Speaker 0: Yeah piece of bread.

422
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,023
Speaker 0: What's up?

423
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:52,608
Speaker 0: All right.

424
00:25:52,669 --> 00:25:53,980
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah somebody got for me.

425
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:58,079
Speaker 0: So, you know we've complained on the show often about everything in the world about.

426
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,113
Speaker 0: you know People in New York walking slow and I wish I could push him over.

427
00:26:01,294 --> 00:26:01,917
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

428
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:02,399
Speaker 0: I did it.

429
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,324
Speaker 0: I fucking.

430
00:26:03,404 --> 00:26:04,429
Speaker 1: I said I would do this.

431
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,354
Speaker 0: you push somebody.

432
00:26:05,494 --> 00:26:12,500
Speaker 1: no, no, no, so Yesterday I get on the subway and while I'm going toward the subway and I'm on the escalator, right?

433
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,580
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, and there's a fat woman and she's blocking the escalator completely.

434
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:20,859
Speaker 1: There's no way to step around her and I see the seven train pull into the station ahead of me.

435
00:26:21,522 --> 00:26:26,180
Speaker 1: I jumped on the railing walked past her and made it to the train All right.

436
00:26:26,421 --> 00:26:43,072
Speaker 1: The doors closed and then she walked up and just before the train left She was standing in front of the door looking at me and she had this moment where obviously she recognized I was the guy who jumped past her and I waved and the scowl on her face just as the trainers pulling away Was one of those beautiful things I've ever seen.

437
00:26:43,092 --> 00:26:44,300
Speaker 0: that is glorious.

438
00:26:44,641 --> 00:26:48,696
Speaker 1: Like I I will have few triumphs of that caliber again in.

439
00:26:48,736 --> 00:26:49,780
Speaker 0: how would it given her the finger?

440
00:26:50,822 --> 00:26:51,866
Speaker 1: No, the polite way.

441
00:26:52,067 --> 00:26:52,489
Speaker 0: No, you can.

442
00:26:52,649 --> 00:26:54,778
Speaker 0: you can hold up a sign that just says fat on it.

443
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:56,925
Speaker 1: See now that goes too far.

444
00:26:56,985 --> 00:27:02,038
Speaker 1: I think the polite wave, you know the perfectly friendly smile like hey, I recognize you.

445
00:27:02,098 --> 00:27:07,982
Speaker 1: Hello I'll admit that when I jumped up on the railing I almost fell off.

446
00:27:08,243 --> 00:27:14,380
Speaker 1: you realize I was like one half an inch from hitting your head on the ceiling from being a YouTube video.

447
00:27:14,602 --> 00:27:18,447
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Don't know if I'll ever do that again anyway.

448
00:27:18,547 --> 00:27:27,760
Speaker 0: improv everywhere our friends who do things like Grand Central Standstill and no pants subway ride and no pants to Ghostbusters busting into the library.

449
00:27:30,021 --> 00:27:41,054
Speaker 0: They went over near the Flatiron building near the where there's a Sprint store on the corner and they got some sidewalk spray chalk And they spray-painted a line down the middle of the sidewalk and a little stencil.

450
00:27:41,094 --> 00:27:51,540
Speaker 0: and the stencil said, you know, tourist lane New Yorker Lane No, and they had some guys stand there saying New Yorkers to the right tourists to the left stop You know stand still take all the pictures you want.

451
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:56,080
Speaker 1: Is it just me or is the beautiful part of that that if that were not a joke that were legitimate?

452
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,890
Speaker 1: I think the majority of New Yorkers would support it wholeheartedly.

453
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:01,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, people seem to enjoy it quite a bit.

454
00:28:02,441 --> 00:28:11,233
Speaker 1: I think what killed me in the video was when the woman pretending to be like a researcher for the Department of Transportation Had like a clipboard with a fake letterhead and everything asking people about it.

455
00:28:11,434 --> 00:28:12,096
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was good.

456
00:28:12,337 --> 00:28:13,240
Speaker 1: Also, there's two guys.

457
00:28:13,681 --> 00:28:18,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, the two guys they got to pretend to be like, you know workers to direct people.

458
00:28:18,601 --> 00:28:22,618
Speaker 1: They were excellent actors and then hey, you gotta get in the line.

459
00:28:22,658 --> 00:28:34,087
Speaker 0: Hey Yeah, and then at the end they showed like, you know, mayor Bloomberg thought it was cute, which is uh, you know Cuz he's a New Yorker - he knows he knows the tourists gotta get out of New York Like the mayor of some other city.

460
00:28:34,328 --> 00:28:36,997
Speaker 1: He probably has like a private car something to get to work.

461
00:28:37,479 --> 00:28:37,840
Speaker 1: New York.

462
00:28:38,101 --> 00:28:39,367
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter how rich you are.

463
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:45,453
Speaker 0: Even the really rich people take the goddamn subway I'm sure you know, he's got a car going around driving him like a Lincoln Town car.

464
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:47,200
Speaker 1: So what is faster to take the subway?

465
00:28:47,621 --> 00:28:53,591
Speaker 1: Yeah, but he's he's subwaying it now and then you know I mean, I guess it's weird though, like if you take the helicopter off the building.

466
00:28:53,611 --> 00:28:54,334
Speaker 0: It seems like the U.S.

467
00:28:54,374 --> 00:28:56,080
Speaker 0: is one of the only countries, you know.

468
00:28:56,381 --> 00:29:02,439
Speaker 0: Well, not maybe one of the only but it's one of the countries where the the higher-up politicians are really separated from.

469
00:29:02,499 --> 00:29:08,620
Speaker 0: you know Everyday life, you know, like if you're in the House of Representatives, you know, you're probably you know an everyday person.

470
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:18,729
Speaker 0: But if you're a governor a senator a mayor of a major city, maybe a president, you know or something like that You're not in everyday life, you know, I mean well

471
00:29:18,749 --> 00:29:24,453
Speaker 1: remember when George Bush senior the old one got out of the White House He had never seen like an automated checkout.

472
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:25,377
Speaker 0: But no that was Reagan.

473
00:29:25,518 --> 00:29:26,000
Speaker 1: Was it Reagan?

474
00:29:26,461 --> 00:29:27,124
Speaker 0: Yes, that was.

475
00:29:27,144 --> 00:29:30,660
Speaker 0: the story was that he went to a grocery store after no longer being president.

476
00:29:30,941 --> 00:29:33,736
Speaker 0: Oh, they had the they had the beep, you know that the barcode scanner.

477
00:29:33,756 --> 00:29:34,600
Speaker 0: He was like, what the hell is that?

478
00:29:35,603 --> 00:29:38,840
Speaker 1: No, I remember George Bush had a different similar technological thing.

479
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:41,200
Speaker 0: Yeah But you know It's it's that kind of thing.

480
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:50,660
Speaker 0: So but if you go to say France like the Prime Minister of France just like drives to work like with everyone else and he drives His own car, you know lives in an apartment building with a bunch of other people.

481
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:55,033
Speaker 0: He doesn't have like a gigantic security detail or bulletproof and you know, it's not like that.

482
00:29:55,575 --> 00:29:56,718
Speaker 0: People are just normal people.

483
00:29:57,019 --> 00:30:00,673

00:31:00,379 --> 00:31:10,640
Speaker 0: Yep We've been I think two people ever so yeah, actually I think one of the bands was like the person was being real bad But I think that it was just like a night of drunkenness.

498
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,487
Speaker 0: So it's sort of like I feel like I shouldn't have.

499
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:24,100
Speaker 0: but at the same time it was such a bad night of drunken posting Yep, that if they that had continued I would you know I had to assume that based on someone's posting that it will they will continue to post that way and would require banning.

500
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,128
Speaker 1: Well, you know as much as I love penny arcade.

514
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:53,017

515
00:31:53,501 --> 00:31:55,530

00:34:49,648 --> 00:34:50,972
Speaker 1: They don't have a number next to them.

576
00:34:51,012 --> 00:34:53,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's like Pokemon one-piece.

577
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,745
Speaker 0: I think there's Naruto movies.

578
00:34:54,864 --> 00:34:55,527
Speaker 0: I think there's any.

579
00:34:55,668 --> 00:34:59,000
Speaker 0: I these sorts of movies are coming out all the time, right?

580
00:34:59,743 --> 00:35:01,540
Speaker 0: But we really pretty much ignore them completely.

581
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:05,791
Speaker 0: And we've never seen a Pokemon movie except for the small bit of one.

582
00:35:05,811 --> 00:35:07,016
Speaker 0: I'm not sure which one it is.

583
00:35:07,076 --> 00:35:09,543
Speaker 0: That is in the The.

584
00:35:09,603 --> 00:35:11,633
Speaker 0: you know, you don't know shit about Pokemon video.

585
00:35:11,673 --> 00:35:13,080
Speaker 1: I don't even know what Pokemon movie that is.

586
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,246
Speaker 0: Didn't they tell us that it was the second one.

587
00:35:15,306 --> 00:35:21,585
Speaker 1: I think I think basically we'd never seen a Pokemon movie at all Not even the first one.

588
00:35:21,805 --> 00:35:26,059
Speaker 1: No, not even, you know mu and mu - nope, nothing zero nothing.

589
00:35:26,381 --> 00:35:29,880
Speaker 0: So so we're at a friend's house due to the Natalie's house.

590
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,426
Speaker 0: We need we need something to watch.

591
00:35:31,446 --> 00:35:35,340
Speaker 1: we're bored and we're like, hey, why don't we watch one of those Pokemon movies?

592
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:41,804
Speaker 0: Well, it was more like looking through Netflix couldn't find anything saw a Pokemon movie joked about it then said hey Maybe we actually should watch it.

593
00:35:42,065 --> 00:35:42,326
Speaker 1: Yeah.

594
00:35:42,587 --> 00:35:46,300
Speaker 1: However, we did not watch the first Pokemon movie.

595
00:35:46,381 --> 00:35:48,316
Speaker 1: We watched what is arguably the worst.

596
00:35:49,842 --> 00:35:54,376
Speaker 0: I don't know which one's better or worse because I've only seen one but people say this is the worst one.

597
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:59,557
Speaker 1: Jackie Joe Bond pocketal monster cash at all no tail.

598
00:35:59,577 --> 00:36:06,958
Speaker 1: and So that translates to what that translates to pocket monsters.

599
00:36:07,038 --> 00:36:07,600
Speaker 1: the movie.

600
00:36:07,925 --> 00:36:16,900
Speaker 0: It sounds so dumb But it has Entei which in the name of it as opposed to the one the we saw the English dub on Netflix secret or spell of the unknown.

601
00:36:17,682 --> 00:36:20,088
Speaker 1: The unknown get it like spelling.

602
00:36:20,188 --> 00:36:20,809
Speaker 0: but why was there?

603
00:36:20,829 --> 00:36:26,568
Speaker 1: the original one translates to something like monsters the movie Lord of the unknown Tower Entei.

604
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, Lord of the unknown tower Entei.

605
00:36:28,441 --> 00:36:35,580
Speaker 0: So that was basically, you know It was about one of the legendary dogs from the gold and silver series the fiery one who apparently goes around raping really?

606
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,166
Speaker 1: Get to that.

607
00:36:36,186 --> 00:36:40,673
Speaker 1: Yeah This movie was surprising.

608
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,200
Speaker 0: It was surprisingly funny.

609
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,900
Speaker 0: Yeah for the right, but it wasn't surprising to me.

610
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:45,624
Speaker 0: It just was.

611
00:36:45,966 --> 00:36:48,400
Speaker 1: but it started with a short and I didn't actually look into this.

612
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,862
Speaker 1: but it started with a short which is can best be described as Pichu.

613
00:36:52,882 --> 00:36:58,700
Speaker 1: brothers almost die Pikachu saves them and they find the secret land of the hobo Pokemon.

614
00:36:59,081 --> 00:37:06,499
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically, I didn't know this but every Pokemon movie begins with a short Pikachu only video, which is awesome Which is pretty cool.

615
00:37:06,941 --> 00:37:13,320
Speaker 0: But apparently it seemed I couldn't tell if it was actually dubbed or if it was just a dubbed over, right?

616
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:29,126
Speaker 0: I didn't even try to find like the Japanese like I was watching it You know dubbed over and I got the feeling that the original was completely silent and contained only well not completely sound But contained only music and sound effects and Pokemon making noises But in English.

617
00:37:29,186 --> 00:37:33,520
Speaker 0: there was this English speaking narrator talking over it saying Pikachu.

618
00:37:33,721 --> 00:37:37,672
Speaker 1: It was basically Stan Lee like Pikachu was in trouble.

619
00:37:37,712 --> 00:37:40,520
Speaker 1: now if he didn't get back in time, what would happen?

620
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:46,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I got the feeling that the I don't know this that the original Japanese just didn't have a narrator period.

621
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,303
Speaker 0: Well, here's the thing.

622
00:37:47,564 --> 00:37:52,080
Speaker 1: if it did have the same narrator then the people who make Pokemon think kids are stupid.

623
00:37:52,321 --> 00:37:57,480
Speaker 1: Yes, if it didn't have the narrator then as we know the Japanese think that American kids are stupid.

624
00:37:57,621 --> 00:38:00,133
Speaker 0: No, the American dubbers think American kids are stupid.

625
00:38:00,213 --> 00:38:03,731
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even like video games I mean, they always give us the easy shit versions of game.

626
00:38:03,771 --> 00:38:03,932
Speaker 1: Yeah.

627
00:38:03,952 --> 00:38:05,540
Speaker 0: Well, they yeah, well, you know, it's the same thing.

628
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:07,040
Speaker 1: But yeah, they know we're stupid.

629
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:18,691
Speaker 0: Yeah I'd like to you know see if the originals out there and see if it was the narration was added only for English or I'm sure that no more than Two minutes of research could have answered this question, but we did not bother.

630
00:38:18,852 --> 00:38:23,299
Speaker 0: but you know all in all without the stupid narration It was just sort of a cute short thing.

631
00:38:23,643 --> 00:38:32,619
Speaker 1: It didn't make a lot of sense though because why are there all these homeless Pokemon living in this basically garbage heap and Pikachu basically ruins the whole thing.

632
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:37,356
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know as a story wise it wasn't so good, but it was just.

633
00:38:37,397 --> 00:38:39,599
Speaker 0: you know, it just cute It had a lot of Pokemon in it.

634
00:38:39,741 --> 00:38:44,187
Speaker 1: I think what got me was that the whole time this narrator is just crazy Like it is.

635
00:38:44,267 --> 00:38:54,257
Speaker 1: literally he punched the little guy Yeah, and then at the end all the Pokemon are helping everybody like everybody's helping everybody and there's no more narrator.

636
00:38:54,558 --> 00:38:58,209
Speaker 1: and Scott says Wow, I'm surprised they don't have a narrator saying.

637
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:02,283
Speaker 1: and that's how they solved it all with teamwork and right then Narrator.

638
00:39:02,303 --> 00:39:05,154
Speaker 1: Oh my it looks like by working together.

639
00:39:05,214 --> 00:39:06,780
Speaker 1: They were able to save the day.

640
00:39:12,182 --> 00:39:15,431
Speaker 0: I mean even three or I mean, I think that it's actually.

641
00:39:15,491 --> 00:39:24,040
Speaker 0: not only are you insulting the intelligence of the three-year-olds by adding in That narrator and the five-year-olds too, but you're actually making them stupider by having the narrator.

642
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,965
Speaker 0: It's like doesn't anyone like?

643
00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:26,687
Speaker 0: what are they?

644
00:39:27,108 --> 00:39:27,850
Speaker 0: What were they thinking?

645
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:32,446
Speaker 0: to do a do a VGN Toss up there.

646
00:39:32,486 --> 00:39:36,320
Speaker 1: So the movie starts and as far as I can tell here's the plot.

647
00:39:36,621 --> 00:39:37,664
Speaker 1: So ashes.

648
00:39:37,704 --> 00:39:42,058
Speaker 1: mom was clearly having an affair with Professor Oak, but that's common knowledge.

649
00:39:42,078 --> 00:39:46,620
Speaker 1: She was having Professor Oak because dad's out of the picture.

650
00:39:47,121 --> 00:39:56,902
Speaker 1: But independent of that she was also having a fair an affair with this other professor who was studying the unknowns Mm-hmm, so Independent of all this.

651
00:39:57,003 --> 00:39:58,887
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure that that mr.

652
00:39:58,927 --> 00:40:04,000
Speaker 1: Mime watches and perhaps engages because he is a creepy motherfucker.

653
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:07,433
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean if ashes mom is gonna have any Pokemon why mr.

654
00:40:07,554 --> 00:40:08,297
Speaker 0: Mime really?

655
00:40:08,377 --> 00:40:08,598
Speaker 1: Why mr.

656
00:40:08,618 --> 00:40:08,839
Speaker 1: Mime?

657
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:15,929
Speaker 0: And I mean if you if you need like a practical Pokemon, I say here if you need a practical Pokemon It's like around the house, you know made kind of stuff.

658
00:40:16,391 --> 00:40:17,494
Speaker 0: Which Pokemon do you get?

659
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:19,471
Speaker 1: I Don't know.

660
00:40:20,741 --> 00:40:21,243
Speaker 0: You don't know.

661
00:40:21,464 --> 00:40:25,220
Speaker 1: maybe a Lucario because he's humanoid or a binary because that's awesome.

662
00:40:25,441 --> 00:40:27,116
Speaker 0: No, I would get a geodude.

663
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:28,685
Speaker 1: obviously I can't lose.

664
00:40:29,067 --> 00:40:31,800
Speaker 0: no not just cuz it can't lose right cuz it floats and it's got hands.

665
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,025
Speaker 0: So it doesn't make the floor dirty.

666
00:40:33,065 --> 00:40:33,828
Speaker 0: It's got hands.

667
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:34,731
Speaker 1: I won.

668
00:40:34,772 --> 00:40:36,860
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure rubble falls off that thing all the time.

669
00:40:38,365 --> 00:40:39,753
Speaker 0: And then you know and like into.

670
00:40:40,035 --> 00:40:40,820
Speaker 1: what do you do?

671
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,060
Speaker 0: It can float up to reach high up things and it can lift heavy thing.

672
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,368
Speaker 1: Have you ever seen a geodude open his fists?

673
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:47,372
Speaker 1: They're not hands.

674
00:40:47,392 --> 00:40:48,496
Speaker 1: They're just fists.

675
00:40:49,058 --> 00:40:49,500
Speaker 1: What?

676
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,470
Speaker 1: All do you do can do is punch.

677
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,180
Speaker 1: you know you tell him to clean the four.

678
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,872
Speaker 1: He'll punch in the floor until he thinks it's clean.

679
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:57,680
Speaker 1: No you dude is an asshole.

680
00:40:59,061 --> 00:41:01,114
Speaker 1: Anyway, you're much better off with the binary.

681
00:41:01,416 --> 00:41:04,504
Speaker 0: anyway Mr.

682
00:41:04,564 --> 00:41:10,260
Speaker 1: Mime is just really really creepy and the way he kind of like is nervous and hanging around ashes mom.

683
00:41:10,521 --> 00:41:11,685
Speaker 1: There's something going on there.

684
00:41:12,187 --> 00:41:15,760
Speaker 0: There's a whole lot of innuendo to be made in this in this movie.

685
00:41:16,002 --> 00:41:19,143
Speaker 1: But the weird thing is You does.

686
00:41:19,223 --> 00:41:26,387
Speaker 1: it is surprising the strength with which I feel the conviction that ashes mom at one point had an affair with Professor Hale.

687
00:41:26,407 --> 00:41:28,967
Speaker 1: Oh Spencer Hale now the oak.

688
00:41:29,007 --> 00:41:29,589
Speaker 1: that was obvious.

689
00:41:29,629 --> 00:41:30,312
Speaker 1: everyone knows that.

690
00:41:30,473 --> 00:41:32,179
Speaker 1: no because why else was you know?

691
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:32,640
Speaker 1: Why?

692
00:41:32,701 --> 00:41:33,925
Speaker 1: why else did this whole thing happen?

693
00:41:33,965 --> 00:41:34,567
Speaker 1: Why did ash?

694
00:41:34,607 --> 00:41:35,551
Speaker 1: Why do they all know each other?

695
00:41:35,992 --> 00:41:38,200
Speaker 1: but Professor Hale in Greenfield?

696
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,786
Speaker 1: There's something going on.

697
00:41:39,827 --> 00:41:41,840
Speaker 1: They had some sort of action a long time ago.

698
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,471
Speaker 1: I think they both try to pretend it didn't happen.

699
00:41:43,753 --> 00:41:44,076
Speaker 0: all right.

700
00:41:44,539 --> 00:41:53,483
Speaker 1: so Professor Hale is studying the unknown and the unknown kidnapped him or something whatever and His daughter.

701
00:41:53,804 --> 00:41:58,820
Speaker 1: basically as far as I can tell that the people who are on with the egg with him on this expedition come back.

702
00:41:58,942 --> 00:42:06,613
Speaker 1: They're like hey Molly You know you're like five years old your dad fucking disappeared, and then they just leave her alone in the mansion I guess to starve to death.

703
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:11,589
Speaker 0: I I'm just reading some internets.

704
00:42:12,152 --> 00:42:14,644
Speaker 1: You don't care about the Pokemon movie Mmm.

705
00:42:14,825 --> 00:42:15,147
Speaker 0: I do.

706
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,797
Speaker 1: I do have anything to say about it.

707
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:26,891
Speaker 1: Was it not strange that they tell her her dad has disappeared and then leave her alone in this mansion with the strange Artifact that they found after he disappeared?

708
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:28,519
Speaker 1: and no one thinks anything of this.

709
00:42:29,702 --> 00:42:31,005
Speaker 0: You know it's it's.

710
00:42:31,908 --> 00:42:33,492
Speaker 0: it was really the thing is right.

711
00:42:33,672 --> 00:42:33,752
Speaker 0: it.

712
00:42:33,812 --> 00:42:42,136
Speaker 0: that really gets me about the whole thing is that the unknown Like spell right where it's like the only reading the unknowns and like figuring out.

713
00:42:42,217 --> 00:42:43,260
Speaker 0: You know where the secret is.

714
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:46,760
Speaker 0: It's like how come no one thought you know figured it out earlier.

715
00:42:47,001 --> 00:42:49,109
Speaker 1: I don't think English exists in the Pokemon world.

716
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:51,378
Speaker 0: You know they write in like some different language they must.

717
00:42:57,702 --> 00:42:59,458
Speaker 0: That's why no one could figure it out.

718
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:15,100
Speaker 1: But if you go back even further I didn't look this up either, but according to our sources The the Molly you know the the kind of main Character the little girl who's left alone in the mansion to starve to death with the evil artifact after her dad disappears.

719
00:43:15,705 --> 00:43:20,700
Speaker 1: Dad who had an affair with with ashes mom She and all this stuff happens.

720
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:27,480
Speaker 1: But just before the plot starts her dad is basically reading her a story like about Entei and how awesome Entei is and she got.

721
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:33,900
Speaker 1: Entei is such a badass and They show a picture of her mom and they don't really say anything.

722
00:43:33,961 --> 00:43:37,046
Speaker 1: But as far as you can tell her mom's just gone Apparently in Japanese.

723
00:43:37,488 --> 00:43:40,280
Speaker 1: for some reason they explained that her mom's in an insane asylum.

724
00:43:41,082 --> 00:43:48,954
Speaker 1: Yeah, her mom must have just gone nuts for some reason or other But clearly because her husband was having an affair with ashes mom and she found out about it.

725
00:43:49,154 --> 00:43:52,023
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe mr.. Mime told her no Mr..

726
00:43:52,063 --> 00:43:57,562
Speaker 0: Mime made her insane with his mind powers So that she would you know forget and It was just.

727
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:05,153
Speaker 1: it was weird that they make a big deal about her mom being gone in the real plot And they just don't mention this at all in the English plot.

728
00:44:05,173 --> 00:44:06,720
Speaker 0: They don't tell you whether she's dead or not.

729
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,180
Speaker 0: They just sort of show you pictures of her with a face covered up.

730
00:44:09,321 --> 00:44:12,577
Speaker 1: I miss mommy and her dad's like yeah, yeah, whatever.

731
00:44:12,918 --> 00:44:17,513
Speaker 1: yeah I'm gonna go study some unknowns and then disappear, and you know it really just does.

732
00:44:17,593 --> 00:44:19,980
Speaker 0: the motivations don't make a lot of sense.

733
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:24,060
Speaker 0: It's like okay the girl has some sort of powers because of Entei or something.

734
00:44:25,465 --> 00:44:30,200
Speaker 1: So she wakes up the unknown because they left her with the weird evil artifact that made her dad disappear and don't think anything of It.

735
00:44:30,441 --> 00:44:36,440
Speaker 1: yep, and the unknowns read her thoughts and create everything that she desired with their psychic powers.

736
00:44:37,103 --> 00:44:44,150
Speaker 1: Mmm, and what she desired was a daddy, but apparently daddy is Entei the dog and not her actual dad.

737
00:44:44,371 --> 00:44:46,680
Speaker 1: think her dad disappeared her mom's gone.

738
00:44:47,621 --> 00:44:49,166
Speaker 1: The unknowns read her mind.

739
00:44:49,507 --> 00:44:51,172
Speaker 1: She doesn't want her mom and dad back.

740
00:44:51,212 --> 00:44:53,520
Speaker 1: She clearly wants Entei to be her dad.

741
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,668
Speaker 1: Why that doesn't make any sense?

742
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:00,600
Speaker 1: Why do I mean I?

743
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:05,420
Speaker 1: Guess unless she never really liked her dad, but she secretly blamed him for her mom going insane.

744
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,468
Speaker 0: Well, it's it's a movie situation right?

745
00:45:07,508 --> 00:45:10,680
Speaker 0: she's basically playing the movie game, and she doesn't want to stop playing the movie game.

746
00:45:10,961 --> 00:45:12,387
Speaker 0: Yeah, when would you know?

747
00:45:12,648 --> 00:45:12,929
Speaker 0: now?

748
00:45:13,029 --> 00:45:15,580
Speaker 0: so you know once someone's got the movie game?

749
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:20,740
Speaker 0: It's like well fuck you know the movie game can replace everybody and everything and the thing is yeah.

750
00:45:20,821 --> 00:45:22,960
Speaker 1: There's one thing better than the movie game what?

751
00:45:27,301 --> 00:45:39,251
Speaker 1: So the unknowns make a fake Entei, and she's like you're my daddy, and this is where the dub is awesome because he's like I'm Daddy or Papa or he says it really creepily.

752
00:45:40,114 --> 00:45:40,996
Speaker 1: and let's fast forward.

753
00:45:41,016 --> 00:45:43,405
Speaker 1: a little bit later She demands a mommy.

754
00:45:43,727 --> 00:45:49,686
Speaker 1: so Entei of course kidnaps ashes mom And he hypnotizes her.

755
00:45:50,228 --> 00:46:03,596
Speaker 1: and there's this scene where this giant Pokemon dog is staring at her And she's got the anime hypnotized eyes, and he's like you are now Mommy, and she's like I'm Mommy.

756
00:46:04,142 --> 00:46:08,157
Speaker 1: And then the scene cuts away, and I'm pretty sure that he raped her right then and there.

757
00:46:08,177 --> 00:46:11,520
Speaker 0: yeah And I the thing is right is so heavily implied.

758
00:46:11,861 --> 00:46:16,600
Speaker 0: I cannot doubt that rape happened, but then how did ashes mom right like you know?

759
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,180
Speaker 0: She just sort of snaps out of it like with her own willpower.

760
00:46:19,501 --> 00:46:23,634
Speaker 1: I saw ash because remember he was coming to do his bullshit like he always does.

761
00:46:23,654 --> 00:46:25,340
Speaker 1: he just happened to be there.

762
00:46:26,621 --> 00:46:32,140
Speaker 0: See the one part the best part of the movie though for me, right if I had to look at the whole movie and say Which part was the biggest day Lisa?

763
00:46:32,641 --> 00:46:37,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's when they met that random Pokemon trainer right away, and we're like just you know having a little poke battle.

764
00:46:37,121 --> 00:46:38,400
Speaker 1: Okay, she's hot and awesome.

765
00:46:38,761 --> 00:46:42,514
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, so why didn't she stick around and continue the awesome?

766
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:43,658
Speaker 1: well cuz I like that.

767
00:46:43,698 --> 00:46:44,501
Speaker 1: battle scenes It was.

768
00:46:44,642 --> 00:46:46,368
Speaker 1: it was like the good-natured combat.

769
00:46:46,669 --> 00:46:48,737
Speaker 1: the credits are kind of playing the music's going.

770
00:46:48,777 --> 00:46:49,560
Speaker 1: It's like a montage.

771
00:46:50,844 --> 00:46:52,239
Speaker 1: And then why was she even there?

772
00:46:53,061 --> 00:46:53,969
Speaker 1: She served no purpose.

773
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:54,938
Speaker 1: she basically stood around.

774
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:57,610
Speaker 1: yeah It based jack and shit and then was kind of in the background.

775
00:46:57,710 --> 00:46:59,537
Speaker 0: the only reason they had her in the movies?

776
00:46:59,557 --> 00:47:03,981
Speaker 0: because without her There would have been zero actual Pokemon trainer battles in the movie It was.

777
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:09,258
Speaker 0: the only other battles were were hacks where everyone versus the end day, and you know there was no.

778
00:47:09,278 --> 00:47:09,378
Speaker 1: no.

779
00:47:09,418 --> 00:47:11,652
Speaker 1: no remember When Lisa or not Lisa when?

780
00:47:11,693 --> 00:47:11,814
Speaker 1: when?

781
00:47:11,834 --> 00:47:12,660
Speaker 1: the little girl Molly?

782
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:18,689
Speaker 1: Basically the Entei and the unknown make her an adult Which is just kind of really.

783
00:47:18,729 --> 00:47:21,440
Speaker 0: that was just like this random scene that made knows that was like.

784
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,363
Speaker 0: Why is this in here?

785
00:47:22,383 --> 00:47:24,088
Speaker 0: It was just really creepy.

786
00:47:24,128 --> 00:47:29,537
Speaker 1: this five-year-old girl is suddenly an adult and of course Brock is all about this.

787
00:47:33,137 --> 00:47:34,506
Speaker 1: But They make her Pokemon.

788
00:47:34,526 --> 00:47:35,510
Speaker 1: They're all basically hacks.

789
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:36,535
Speaker 1: She's got like a game shark.

790
00:47:36,555 --> 00:47:37,961
Speaker 1: sure she wins no matter What.

791
00:47:38,182 --> 00:47:40,493
Speaker 0: yeah the other thing right is the.

792
00:47:40,573 --> 00:47:42,160
Speaker 0: the team rocket is there right?

793
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:51,053
Speaker 0: Oh apparently they're in every movie, and they never do anything, but it's not the cool team rocket with you know like Giovanni it's the other two stupid team rockets in the mouth.

794
00:47:51,093 --> 00:47:52,097
Speaker 0: That's I like that.

795
00:47:52,117 --> 00:47:54,747
Speaker 0: the mouth is good But I don't know about the other the other people.

796
00:47:55,007 --> 00:47:55,730
Speaker 1: I like them.

797
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,396
Speaker 0: I don't think there's Musashi.

798
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,660
Speaker 1: It's fucking hilarious.

799
00:47:59,421 --> 00:48:06,947
Speaker 0: Anyway, so you know it's like they're there in the movie, and they're doing funny trying to be like comic relief But it's like no one.

800
00:48:06,987 --> 00:48:08,815
Speaker 0: they don't interact with any of the characters.

801
00:48:08,855 --> 00:48:09,920
Speaker 0: They're like these observers.

802
00:48:10,081 --> 00:48:13,073
Speaker 0: They're like they're like sticking off the side of the movie like a wart.

803
00:48:13,394 --> 00:48:14,860
Speaker 0: You know they don't interact with the plot.

804
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:16,467
Speaker 0: They don't talk to the other characters.

805
00:48:16,507 --> 00:48:18,155
Speaker 0: They don't ever see the other characters.

806
00:48:18,215 --> 00:48:19,019
Speaker 0: No one sees them.

807
00:48:19,803 --> 00:48:20,004
Speaker 0: They're.

808
00:48:20,225 --> 00:48:26,071
Speaker 0: they're like the guys in the Muppet show who are up in the balcony Just providing comedy, but never doing anything.

809
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:35,620
Speaker 1: the thing is as far as I can tell the joke they always do is something stupid will happen and One of their Pokemon seems to somehow always get out of his pokeball just to go.

810
00:48:38,504 --> 00:48:41,818
Speaker 0: Yeah, like the wobbuff that comes up, but he just appears out of nowhere.

811
00:48:41,858 --> 00:48:46,833
Speaker 0: He goes And then they put it back in the ball, and they look at him like Jesus.

812
00:48:46,853 --> 00:48:48,640
Speaker 1: How the fuck did you get out again?

813
00:48:50,381 --> 00:48:53,720
Speaker 0: One thing I learned watching this movie that I didn't know is that pokeballs shrink.

814
00:48:54,285 --> 00:48:58,400
Speaker 0: It's like you put the Pokemon in the ball And then it's already the Pokemon is too big to fit in that ball.

815
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:01,170
Speaker 1: So he shrinks and they make a big deal about that in the cartoon.

816
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:01,953
Speaker 1: and then the pokeball.

817
00:49:02,113 --> 00:49:03,960
Speaker 0: and then the pokeball shrinks again.

818
00:49:04,405 --> 00:49:05,840
Speaker 0: So now it's like even smaller.

819
00:49:06,442 --> 00:49:07,365
Speaker 0: It's like whoa.

820
00:49:07,385 --> 00:49:09,151
Speaker 0: that dude is like dying in there.

821
00:49:09,192 --> 00:49:10,376
Speaker 1: You see how big those things are.

822
00:49:10,436 --> 00:49:11,600
Speaker 1: how would he carry so many?

823
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,109
Speaker 0: And you can fit like any size Pokemon in there.

824
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:14,692
Speaker 0: legendary.

825
00:49:14,752 --> 00:49:15,335
Speaker 0: put him in the ball.

826
00:49:15,355 --> 00:49:17,908
Speaker 0: You know yeah He's as big as a building in the ball.

827
00:49:18,069 --> 00:49:20,020
Speaker 1: Wonder what would happen if you just use a pokeball on a person.

828
00:49:21,462 --> 00:49:21,985
Speaker 0: How does?

829
00:49:22,026 --> 00:49:24,420
Speaker 0: yes, they never explain like how a pokeball works.

830
00:49:24,802 --> 00:49:25,225
Speaker 0: Why does it?

831
00:49:25,245 --> 00:49:25,466
Speaker 0: you know?

832
00:49:25,486 --> 00:49:27,539
Speaker 0: couldn't I put anything in a pokeball like your house?

833
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,768
Speaker 1: Right, maybe only organic matter Maybe just Pokemon and then things break at.

834
00:49:32,788 --> 00:49:40,826
Speaker 0: the Pokemon can break out somehow, so it's like just that Pokemon But they cannot know.

835
00:49:40,846 --> 00:49:43,039
Speaker 0: I mean like when you're trying to capture them it might not work.

836
00:49:43,401 --> 00:49:49,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, well then once they're captured you didn't hit a and B at the same time every time it stopped shaking at the third shake.

837
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,047
Speaker 1: Right I entered the Konami code.

838
00:49:53,709 --> 00:49:54,733
Speaker 0: They need a pokey code.

839
00:49:55,174 --> 00:49:55,656
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

840
00:49:55,676 --> 00:49:55,957
Speaker 1: They do.

841
00:49:57,402 --> 00:50:00,873
Speaker 0: But yeah, if I'm gonna judge all Pokemon movies based on this.

842
00:50:01,174 --> 00:50:02,840
Speaker 0: I really don't want to watch any more folks.

843
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:03,863
Speaker 1: Okay, I want to know.

844
00:50:03,883 --> 00:50:05,348
Speaker 0: tell us for a comic relief.

845
00:50:05,488 --> 00:50:07,756
Speaker 1: Tell us what the best Pokemon is.

846
00:50:08,077 --> 00:50:09,100
Speaker 1: we've seen the worst movie.

847
00:50:09,401 --> 00:50:14,999
Speaker 1: I want to see the best like when Scott read the so-called best Star Wars novel and they were average.

848
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:18,272
Speaker 0: You know I mean everyone says all the best Star Wars novels.

849
00:50:18,292 --> 00:50:19,939
Speaker 0: that Timothy's on Thrawn thing.

850
00:50:19,959 --> 00:50:20,120
Speaker 0: you know.

851
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:22,049
Speaker 0: Thrawn is awesome as a character.

852
00:50:22,069 --> 00:50:24,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, but those books were just average.

853
00:50:25,183 --> 00:50:35,454
Speaker 1: Ron is really just a cross between a lensman because he's basically perfect and Frickin the vampire Strahd from Ravenloft mm-hmm.

854
00:50:35,555 --> 00:50:36,659
Speaker 1: That's basically all he is.

855
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,827
Speaker 0: He's just a really smart awesome kind of dude.

856
00:50:40,068 --> 00:50:43,617
Speaker 1: signal vice-admiral Thrawn to lashes tie squadrons immediately.

857
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:48,005
Speaker 1: very well oh My god this fucking.

858
00:50:48,085 --> 00:50:54,044
Speaker 1: but I feel like if we watched a better Pokemon movie It would be less fun because we watched this with Judith and Natalie I think their friends.

859
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:55,189
Speaker 0: is there a Pokemon movie.

860
00:50:55,209 --> 00:50:57,580
Speaker 0: That's very similar to the good Pokemon manga?

861
00:50:58,162 --> 00:50:58,784
Speaker 1: I don't think so.

862
00:50:59,025 --> 00:51:00,490
Speaker 0: they should make a Pokemon adventure.

863
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:03,701
Speaker 0: is the movie like a you know separate from all the other movies like on its Own?

864
00:51:03,822 --> 00:51:08,120
Speaker 1: what made this movie worth watching for us was primarily the implied rape.

865
00:51:09,263 --> 00:51:13,627
Speaker 0: Yeah, all the hilarious like you know Innuendos and things that we wrote into it.

866
00:51:13,828 --> 00:51:17,720
Speaker 0: because we're adults and because we're not children and we're watching a children's movie mr.

867
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,806
Speaker 0: Bucket you know this is it's a fun.

868
00:51:19,866 --> 00:51:23,999
Speaker 0: It's basically like you know you had a little mermaid and get King Triton's penis situation.

869
00:51:25,681 --> 00:51:26,931
Speaker 0: It's basically that times 100.

870
00:51:26,931 --> 00:51:34,738
Speaker 1: so The only bad part of them in the movie was pretty awful, but it wasn't like bad.

871
00:51:34,778 --> 00:51:36,827
Speaker 0: It wasn't OD No, it wasn't bad.

872
00:51:36,888 --> 00:51:40,084
Speaker 0: It was just except it was Interminable.

873
00:51:40,425 --> 00:51:51,973
Speaker 1: at the end right that like there's this fight scene and just before it comes up I think Judith is like yeah this fight scene lasts for fucking ever and sure enough it Lasted forever, and then it ended.

874
00:51:52,113 --> 00:51:53,340
Speaker 1: yeah, then it started again.

875
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:59,620
Speaker 0: There really aren't that many plot points, but basically each thing is dragged out, and it's over all the plot points.

876
00:52:00,021 --> 00:52:06,040
Speaker 1: So starting only things we see in the movie, so it starts with random Pokemon battle with Lisa.

877
00:52:06,221 --> 00:52:07,647
Speaker 1: I guess it's not really a plot point except.

878
00:52:07,968 --> 00:52:10,520
Speaker 1: She's the reason they go to this town in the first place.

879
00:52:10,741 --> 00:52:12,569
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I guess that's a plot point.

880
00:52:13,513 --> 00:52:15,060
Speaker 1: Oh shit Molly's dad disappeared.

881
00:52:15,763 --> 00:52:18,695
Speaker 1: Oh shit, Molly has the power of all the universe and has an Entei.

882
00:52:18,775 --> 00:52:19,980
Speaker 0: Oh shit unknowns, right?

883
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,082
Speaker 0: It's the same shit.

884
00:52:21,143 --> 00:52:26,638
Speaker 1: Molly kidnaps Ash's mom so Entei can rape her and make her her mom.

885
00:52:26,658 --> 00:52:36,020
Speaker 0: yep Ash tries to save them and fails and then Charizard shows up, and he saves everybody.

886
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,793
Speaker 1: Basically yeah, Charizard saves everybody.

887
00:52:38,854 --> 00:52:39,800
Speaker 0: that was so random too.

888
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:47,106
Speaker 0: it's like they just show you like they cut away, and you're like you're in the land of the Charizards and There's some lady there.

889
00:52:47,126 --> 00:52:48,132
Speaker 0: You don't even know who she is.

890
00:52:48,152 --> 00:52:49,400
Speaker 1: She looked fucking badass.

891
00:52:49,723 --> 00:52:51,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, well I want to see a movie all about the land of the Charizard.

892
00:52:52,161 --> 00:52:57,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then you know it's like Charizard shows up and saves the day because he couldn't have done it without a flying Pokemon.

893
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,584
Speaker 0: So Deus Ex Machina.

894
00:52:58,604 --> 00:53:04,061
Speaker 0: He shows up and the foreshadowing was we show you the land of the Charizards Shit.

895
00:53:04,523 --> 00:53:07,073
Speaker 1: yeah, I learned something kind of unrelated turns out.

896
00:53:07,093 --> 00:53:08,960

00:53:18,882 --> 00:53:19,865
Speaker 0: I don't know anything else.

904
00:53:20,407 --> 00:53:21,851
Speaker 0: I don't know this.

905
00:53:22,754 --> 00:53:24,258
Speaker 1: this movie is worth watching.

906
00:53:24,439 --> 00:53:28,160
Speaker 0: I feel Is it really worth watching all right?

907
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,827
Speaker 1: It's only worth as far as I can tell.

908

911
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:44,160
Speaker 0: I think there's someone who's gonna provide a lol commentary to it.

912
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:47,492
Speaker 1: I think Dave and Joel could make this movie equally for those two guys.

913
00:53:47,512 --> 00:53:48,335
Speaker 0: You can't live ten.

914
00:53:48,355 --> 00:53:52,352
Speaker 1: Oh my god I would watch any media if they were narrating it.

915
00:53:52,513 --> 00:53:55,628
Speaker 1: I know right I Don't know what else we can say about this movie.

916
00:53:55,688 --> 00:53:57,639
Speaker 1: all right and crystals form and then go away.

917
00:53:58,142 --> 00:53:58,867
Speaker 0: No, the crystals.

918
00:53:58,907 --> 00:54:07,420
Speaker 0: Basically you're just you know part of the Entei kidnapping situation, I'm pretty sure that thousands died in the background of this movie.

919
00:54:08,224 --> 00:54:09,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's one of those things.

920
00:54:09,351 --> 00:54:13,247
Speaker 0: they show you huge collateral damage But they never show you any deaths.

921
00:54:13,508 --> 00:54:18,943
Speaker 0: or you know actual permanent damage related to I'm pretty sure those crystals Collateral damage.

922
00:54:18,963 --> 00:54:23,417
Speaker 0: you did not make it yeah, but they didn't actually show any person getting covered by them.

923
00:54:23,457 --> 00:54:31,340
Speaker 1: Just a town Yeah, so all right and the Entei was fake and also there was an underwater Pokemon battle, but Missy didn't turn into a mermaid.
