1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,694
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, September 14th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,694 --> 00:00:10,055
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:12,000
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:12,521 --> 00:00:19,663
Speaker 0: We are reviewing oath Chronicles of Empire and exile.

5
00:00:20,185 --> 00:00:21,229
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:22,297 --> 00:00:27,343
Speaker 0: so, uh, I Uninstalled Pokemon unite because it's a pay-to-win piece of shit game.

7
00:00:27,383 --> 00:00:27,845
Speaker 0: Just like

8
00:00:27,925 --> 00:00:29,310
Speaker 1: I understand that a long time

9
00:00:29,631 --> 00:00:40,002
Speaker 0: I played it a bunch because the thing about that game that bothers me is Like we don't tend to review games that are bad on geek nights much anymore like we rarely do that because they're just not even worth engaging with.

10
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:40,766
Speaker 0: like who cares?

11
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:49,678
Speaker 0: but Pokemon unite Its actual core game is super fun Like I really enjoy playing it like.

12
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:56,085
Speaker 0: that is an interesting take on a MOBA that I really want to see explored more But they literally ruined it with all that pay-to-win.

13
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:56,889
Speaker 0: So I uninstalled it.

14
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:06,140
Speaker 0: However, when I uninstalled it it meant that I looked at for a brief moment the full library of games I bought on my switch instead of just the ones that play like.

15
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,630
Speaker 1: I do think that's an issue with the switch interface.

16
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:09,410
Speaker 1: Is that you know?

17
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:16,036
Speaker 1: They put your apps in a straight line and you can go to the end and push the button like show all and you got Grid on the DS.

18
00:01:16,398 --> 00:01:19,590
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, you couldn't see everything on one page if you had too many things.

19
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,887
Speaker 1: But you could make folders and it would.

20
00:01:22,089 --> 00:01:23,417
Speaker 1: you know You could and it was like a great.

21
00:01:23,437 --> 00:01:25,490
Speaker 1: you could I guess you could set it differently, right?

22
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,129
Speaker 1: You could choose how to lay them out.

23
00:01:27,652 --> 00:01:31,426
Speaker 1: But on the DS I had the grid was like the default on my DS at least and I could.

24
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,390
Speaker 1: you could see everything.

25
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,779
Speaker 1: So you wouldn't like forget like, oh right that game.

26
00:01:35,839 --> 00:01:37,163
Speaker 1: It's like it's staring you right in the face.

27
00:01:37,183 --> 00:01:44,741
Speaker 1: Whereas a good example is like Like Sonic Mania I bought that right by digital.

28
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:46,206
Speaker 0: Oh, I remembered I owned that too.

29
00:01:46,266 --> 00:01:47,049
Speaker 0: I forgot I owned that.

30
00:01:48,352 --> 00:01:49,158
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not bad.

31
00:01:49,178 --> 00:01:50,870
Speaker 1: I could I could have played it more than I did.

32
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:56,750
Speaker 1: I probably will play it again, but it's like it's not on the strip when I turn my switch on.

33
00:01:57,352 --> 00:02:02,106
Speaker 1: So I don't think to go to it because there's usually something on the strip that I've played.

34
00:02:02,146 --> 00:02:02,828
Speaker 1: recently cuz

35
00:02:02,888 --> 00:02:16,250
Speaker 0: I'm busy I'm an adult and with video games out of sight out of mind Like I got I have so many options for gaming that if I'm presented with a list of options I'll probably be more than happy to play one of the things I currently am looking at.

36
00:02:16,853 --> 00:02:18,141
Speaker 1: Yeah, steam does a better job.

37
00:02:18,161 --> 00:02:21,920
Speaker 1: what you know, you have a more screen real estate Obviously, you can also make all those rules like.

38
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,844
Speaker 0: I have different filters.

39
00:02:22,884 --> 00:02:27,150
Speaker 0: that'll like filter down to games I play regularly or games I have actually installed.

40
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:31,648
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm excited actually because the new iOS comes out Monday, right?

41
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:43,962
Speaker 1: So yeah days for now and they added this feature Called like focuses and the idea of the feature is that you'll be like, okay I want you tell your you know, iPhone or iPad.

42
00:02:43,982 --> 00:02:51,714
Speaker 1: Hey, I want to focus on Art right now or I want to focus on you know You know whatever right now, right?

43
00:02:51,754 --> 00:03:06,254
Speaker 1: You can figure each focus and it's most of the focus settings are around notifications because it would be like Okay If you're focusing on that we only want to give you notifications for these things right now and mute or hide Notifications for these other things.

44
00:03:06,294 --> 00:03:18,840
Speaker 1: like you might have a notification for some news thing, but if you're currently in art focus mode okay, we'll turn it off for now and when you go back to Normal mode or going about my day mode.

45
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,609
Speaker 1: We'll let that notification come through right that sort of thing.

46
00:03:22,891 --> 00:03:29,578
Speaker 1: However, the what I really want that feature for is that it lets you customize The like your home pages.

47
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:34,114
Speaker 1: Yeah, right and your widgets and everything Per focus.

48
00:03:34,154 --> 00:03:39,390
Speaker 1: It's like if you choose your art focus, you'll just instead of like having to go to your art folder.

49
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:42,870
Speaker 1: It's like your whole home page will just be your art apps, right?

50
00:03:43,552 --> 00:03:45,177
Speaker 0: That what you described being used for.

51
00:03:45,197 --> 00:03:49,129
Speaker 0: I would definitely have a convention focus like what do I do exactly?

52
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,320
Speaker 1: so That same feature could be good on a thing.

53
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,270
Speaker 1: You know a video game system like a switch or steam, right?

54
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:59,954
Speaker 1: So imagine steam, you know, you open up steam and you say hey steam I'm.

55
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:00,337
Speaker 1: it's.

56
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:02,773
Speaker 1: it's Sunday and it's rainy Right.

57
00:04:03,214 --> 00:04:06,344
Speaker 1: Show me the long single-player games.

58
00:04:06,424 --> 00:04:10,764
Speaker 1: I'm sitting here all day by myself Or you could be like it's steam.

59
00:04:11,427 --> 00:04:13,898
Speaker 1: It's Six o'clock seven o'clock.

60
00:04:13,938 --> 00:04:16,608
Speaker 1: I finished dinner on a weeknight and my friends are here.

61
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,810
Speaker 1: Show me the three to four player co-op multiplayer games, right?

62
00:04:22,711 --> 00:04:36,631
Speaker 1: like a you know, if you can if the thing your library wouldn't filter by Genre or the game you played recently or just some tags, right but actually based on your situation Right.

63
00:04:37,656 --> 00:04:47,490
Speaker 1: show you the correct set of things to choose from So that the iOS when you have to configure it by hand Which I'm gonna probably spend a lot of time doing especially on my iPad.

64
00:04:47,512 --> 00:04:56,510
Speaker 0: Yeah It's tricky though because that feels a lot like The organization of files and all these other things like like tried to get away that doll point libraries were supposed to eliminate that.

65
00:04:56,613 --> 00:05:10,285
Speaker 0: Yep like the way I used to handle photos is I would like in flicker like in ancient times and then Lightroom like old Lightroom in ancient times like tag the people in all my photos so I could Like manually curate all this data.

66
00:05:10,325 --> 00:05:10,950
Speaker 0: like what are these little?

67
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:23,270
Speaker 0: increasingly I can rely on heuristics machine learning and other ways to filter my data and It's almost that the effort I put into curating that old data ended up being worthless.

68
00:05:24,132 --> 00:05:27,964
Speaker 0: So I find that I increasingly am unwilling to curate current data.

69
00:05:28,325 --> 00:05:32,188
Speaker 0: if I can foresee a future Where that curation will be replaced by something?

70
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,849
Speaker 1: Yeah, the problem is is that the current automatic stuff like it's good.

71
00:05:37,731 --> 00:05:41,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it won't tell me like show me all my sports easily like this way.

72
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,161
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not but it's not good enough.

73
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:44,830
Speaker 1: like doing it by hand is still better.

74
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,930
Speaker 1: So you're always finding issues if you rely on some automated thing.

75
00:05:49,351 --> 00:05:53,107
Speaker 1: But to do it by hand to get the better result is so much work.

76
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:53,850
Speaker 1: It's not worth it.

77
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,054
Speaker 1: It's like we're suffers.

78
00:05:55,095 --> 00:06:02,261
Speaker 1: We're settling for a crappy result because it's too much Manual work to get a better result, right?

79
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:04,810
Speaker 1: So the automatic crappy result ends up winning.

80
00:06:05,191 --> 00:06:05,553
Speaker 1: It's like.

81
00:06:05,874 --> 00:06:08,322
Speaker 1: but if I really just give me the automatic good result, let's go.

82
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:10,068
Speaker 1: It's taking so long.

83
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:15,050
Speaker 0: Yep I feel like there's a big sector there that could be explored but that's more of a Monday topic.

84
00:06:15,331 --> 00:06:16,375
Speaker 1: But anyway, I'm just so.

85
00:06:16,717 --> 00:06:21,597
Speaker 0: because of this I happen to clay see Everything installed on my switch.

86
00:06:21,637 --> 00:06:23,527
Speaker 0: I saw that Sonic game, which looked pretty good.

87
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:25,028
Speaker 0: That's the kind of game I'd play like on the train.

88
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:29,384
Speaker 0: I'm just sitting there and I saw west of loathing which I had literally never played.

89
00:06:29,665 --> 00:06:30,147
Speaker 0: even a second.

90
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:31,413
Speaker 1: had that I have it on Steam.

91
00:06:31,453 --> 00:06:33,448
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I started playing it.

92
00:06:34,514 --> 00:06:35,410
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna do a full review.

93
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,565
Speaker 0: All I'll say is that I've been playing it a lot lately.

94
00:06:38,585 --> 00:06:42,750
Speaker 0: if I get a beat it real soon That game is funny as shit that game.

95
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,377
Speaker 1: So I played it when it came.

96
00:06:44,397 --> 00:06:46,788
Speaker 1: I played it when it came out and I didn't beat it.

97
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:52,030
Speaker 1: But I basically played it and played it and played it and got really far and I got there a certain point and then I stopped.

98
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:57,810
Speaker 1: I wasn't sure how close I was to the ending but I was pretty deep and I was having plenty of fun with it.

99
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:05,430
Speaker 1: I think I may have talked about it at when I could go figure out Figure out when the game came out and then look at Tuesday geek nights around that time.

100
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,050
Speaker 1: You might see me talking about it and that'll be better than me talking about it.

101
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,650
Speaker 1: Now years later who has forgotten almost everything?

102
00:07:12,091 --> 00:07:14,960
Speaker 0: But I guess the high level of what I would actually say is that one.

103
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:20,974
Speaker 0: it just like it's stylistically really well put together - it's actually a pretty real game.

104
00:07:21,035 --> 00:07:26,570
Speaker 0: the puzzles ain't trivial like they're clever puzzles kind of like the original kingdom of loathing.

105
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:29,989
Speaker 0: three the soundtrack fucking slaps.

106
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,962
Speaker 0: and four the writing like the way characters engage with each other.

107
00:07:34,982 --> 00:07:44,645
Speaker 0: and like what the plot is is this mix of It's funny and weird, but it also takes itself seriously in so far as a game like this

108
00:07:44,685 --> 00:07:45,069
Speaker 1: can and

109
00:07:46,815 --> 00:07:57,006
Speaker 0: I don't know like Choices you make in this game actually do feel like they have consequences in a way that a lot of more real role-playing games They really don't feel like they do anything like.

110
00:07:57,308 --> 00:08:03,467
Speaker 1: yeah I mean if you spend your effort working on that part of the game and not on you know fancy graphics Then guess what you can.

111
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:08,946
Speaker 1: But I also do want to mention though that like wasn't it revealed one of the loathing.

112
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:11,850
Speaker 1: the guy who made Kingdom of loathing is like a piece of shit.

113
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:16,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, I remember something like that, but I remember the details of which dude it was or what the deal was.

114
00:08:17,673 --> 00:08:21,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I don't know if that person will get money if you buy west of loathing now.

115
00:08:21,873 --> 00:08:23,642
Speaker 1: So I don't want to you know for that reason.

116
00:08:23,702 --> 00:08:27,116
Speaker 1: I don't want to tell you to go buy it But I will say as a game.

117
00:08:27,136 --> 00:08:31,870
Speaker 0: I am deeply and thoroughly enjoying it, and I am gonna finish it soon.

118
00:08:32,251 --> 00:08:33,942
Speaker 0: I just killed that fucking necromancer.

119
00:08:33,962 --> 00:08:43,115
Speaker 1: Yeah, I already own it So maybe I will go back to it, and I'd have to start over, but it you know it shouldn't take that long to Alright, so the other game.

120
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:48,679
Speaker 0: I've been playing and I can't really say much about it yet is aliens fireteam elite Which is the you took.

121
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:54,110
Speaker 1: you took the bullet because I looked at that game And I said man that looks like a fun game for us to play together, but it's 40 bucks.

122
00:08:54,853 --> 00:08:55,515
Speaker 1: Rim has money.

123
00:08:55,575 --> 00:08:57,281
Speaker 1: you go test it out tentatively.

124
00:08:57,302 --> 00:08:59,229
Speaker 0: It's co-op only which I do appreciate.

125
00:08:59,249 --> 00:09:14,246
Speaker 0: it's 3-player co-op specifically which happens to solve a problem that me and Scott have where there are exactly three of us who are pretty much Always down to play a game Only to figure out more genres of game that are good for three player co-op besides.

126
00:09:14,326 --> 00:09:15,872
Speaker 1: shoot stuff with your friends Yeah,

127
00:09:16,414 --> 00:09:28,429
Speaker 0: but if I had to describe it on a really high level take Left for dead and a lot of the things that left for dead did especially left for dead to Cross it with hell divers if anybody remembers that game that we reviewed.

128
00:09:29,631 --> 00:09:31,677
Speaker 1: Yeah, yes, that's basically shoot.

129
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:33,623
Speaker 1: shoot things with your friends robotron.

130
00:09:33,643 --> 00:09:35,950
Speaker 1: There's a million games that are just like it's base.

131
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:38,770
Speaker 0: It's sort of a first-person shooter, but like head-clicking doesn't matter.

132
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:42,230
Speaker 0: What matters a lot more is you're playing a real fucking story game?

133
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,433
Speaker 0: Just co-op like.

134
00:09:43,774 --> 00:10:05,161
Speaker 0: it's a full-on aliens game with all the proper nouns you'd expect and the game is basically You're the Marines sent in to do a mission and of course shit goes sideways and you'll like make your way Solve puzzles go along and then you'll get cornered somewhere and you'll play out the scene from aliens Where the turret mo is slowly running down to zero.

135
00:10:05,643 --> 00:10:15,844
Speaker 0: you'll play that scene out over and over again But the scene is so different and so stressful every time that it's pretty fun But I don't know if it's $40 fun yet.

136
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,579
Speaker 0: I got a poke at it more to make it a true.

137
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,805
Speaker 0: It is definitely $15 fun.

138
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,977
Speaker 0: If this game was $15, I'd say buy it immediately.

139
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,964
Speaker 0: I don't know about 40.

140
00:10:24,964 --> 00:10:26,650
Speaker 0: I'm debating if 20 is the line.

141
00:10:26,851 --> 00:10:29,490
Speaker 0: So stay tuned, but I'm gonna play it some more.

142
00:10:30,193 --> 00:10:37,300
Speaker 0: the other cool thing it does if you don't have a third person or even a second person if You go into the matchmaking to find people to play with eventually.

143
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,163
Speaker 0: It'll just be like fuck it.

144
00:10:38,203 --> 00:10:38,886
Speaker 0: Here's an AI.

145
00:10:39,187 --> 00:10:43,259
Speaker 1: He'll be good enough Yeah, so in similar news, right?

146
00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:45,890
Speaker 1: I got the Wario where game for 50 bucks.

147
00:10:47,153 --> 00:10:58,714
Speaker 1: you know, I'm testing that one out and You know, if you like if you're a Wario where person like you like a Wario where you know single-player it's like Yeah, you should get this game.

148
00:10:58,814 --> 00:11:00,257
Speaker 1: But should you $50 get this game?

149
00:11:02,591 --> 00:11:02,711
Speaker 1: Right.

150
00:11:02,852 --> 00:11:05,907
Speaker 1: It's like, you know breath of the wild is 50 60 bucks.

151
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:06,450
Speaker 1: It's like woof.

152
00:11:06,671 --> 00:11:09,989
Speaker 1: It's tough to save $50 for Wario, even if it's a good Wario.

153
00:11:11,292 --> 00:11:18,185
Speaker 1: But I haven't played any of the multiplayer modes yet At least not ones that didn't have a single-player option.

154
00:11:18,688 --> 00:11:20,352
Speaker 1: but just Examining them.

155
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:23,963
Speaker 1: there is some potential there for some good party times.

156
00:11:24,545 --> 00:11:26,109
Speaker 1: I just don't know if they'll be.

157
00:11:26,892 --> 00:11:31,930
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, we had Wario where that was endless fun party times the GameCube one, right?

158
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:37,054
Speaker 1: And we had Wario where that was no fun party times that we won This one might.

159
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:43,989
Speaker 1: my guess is that it's gonna be in the middle where it's like fun party times that run out like you get Bored of it, but you'll it's good until you get bored of it.

160
00:11:44,612 --> 00:11:45,977
Speaker 1: So we'll see if it's 50 bucks.

161
00:11:46,017 --> 00:11:49,230
Speaker 1: good, but um, you know Wario, right?

162
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,381
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's got the good Wario style.

163
00:11:51,401 --> 00:11:52,790
Speaker 1: You never get tired of Wario style.

164
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:53,572
Speaker 1: No It's really

165
00:11:53,833 --> 00:12:06,530
Speaker 0: the only the only thing I ever get disappointed about with Wario games that they've so far Still not counting this one, which I have not touched yet They haven't made Wario games that are even close to as good at multiplayer as the Wario where on the GameCube.

166
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:08,976
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I mean, you know, we'll.

167
00:12:08,996 --> 00:12:13,090
Speaker 1: we'll probably talk more about it after we play all the multiplayer in a party situation.

168
00:12:13,651 --> 00:12:19,787
Speaker 1: But you know just early, you know early thoughts on the Wario game that you know is out now.

169
00:12:20,048 --> 00:12:27,923
Speaker 1: Yeah and Metroid whatever it comes out like a month from now, so Save your money for that one.

170
00:12:27,984 --> 00:12:31,690
Speaker 0: Yeah So you got any gaming news on this fine Tuesday?

171
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,730
Speaker 1: Do I have a gaming news?

172
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,221
Speaker 1: Well, it's sort of a gaming news and that you know much.

173
00:12:37,281 --> 00:12:41,710
Speaker 1: like we just talked about the West a loathing guy Whoever that is who I heard was bad.

174
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,869
Speaker 1: There were other gaming people who were revealed to be bad.

175
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:56,670
Speaker 1: So there's a company you may have heard of called broken token and what they sell are basically like these little wooden Insert replacements to go in your board game boxes.

176
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:00,200
Speaker 1: It's like there's a board game you buy and everyone knows that.

177
00:13:00,461 --> 00:13:04,071
Speaker 1: the the plastic inserts that come in board games to help you organize the Game.

178
00:13:04,653 --> 00:13:07,884
Speaker 1: first of all, you know, let's talk about those just I was about.

179
00:13:08,064 --> 00:13:09,609
Speaker 0: I was about to say there's a whole there.

180
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,750
Speaker 0: We could do a whole fucking show on that concept.

181
00:13:12,031 --> 00:13:13,496
Speaker 1: But the point is they suck right.

182
00:13:13,576 --> 00:13:15,623
Speaker 1: companies put them in there to like.

183
00:13:15,924 --> 00:13:20,617
Speaker 1: they don't tell you how you're supposed to Organize the game in the thing, right?

184
00:13:20,837 --> 00:13:22,943
Speaker 1: You just sort of guess and figure it out.

185
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:27,369
Speaker 1: It takes up a lot of air in the box Because they want to have a big box.

186
00:13:27,531 --> 00:13:29,721
Speaker 1: I guess it like makes the box bigger for no reason.

187
00:13:29,741 --> 00:13:33,583
Speaker 1: if you took the insert out and just threw it in the trash You could put the whole game in a smaller box.

188
00:13:33,603 --> 00:13:46,170
Speaker 1: It's just wasting space you If you get an expansion for the game well now you can't fit it fucking in there because The inserts taken up all the space and the insert wasn't made with the expansions in mind.

189
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,950
Speaker 1: Alright, so those things to begin with suck.

190
00:13:49,050 --> 00:14:03,609
Speaker 1: So the broken token was a company that's like, alright You wanna you don't want to rebox your game like in a completely new box You don't just want to put everything in baggies and toss it in the box because you're a fancy gamer person Who's gonna sleeve everything and spend a lot of money or whatever?

191
00:14:04,212 --> 00:14:14,230
Speaker 0: So we'll sell you this wooden organizing thing, but these wooden organizers They echo like old board games had these things in like there was an error where they had really good things at them.

192
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:18,065
Speaker 0: But they only work if you'd never carry that fucking box anywhere ever.

193
00:14:18,647 --> 00:14:26,367
Speaker 0: if that box anyway But the horizontal in your closet and you bring it out just to play the game and you put it straight back into the closet Keeping it horizontal the entire time.

194
00:14:27,091 --> 00:14:29,900
Speaker 1: Well, the idea is you spent you give them money and they make it.

195
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,390
Speaker 1: they make things custom to particular games and then you know.

196
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,338
Speaker 1: So you would organize your stuff in this wooden thing.

197
00:14:35,358 --> 00:14:40,368
Speaker 1: So apparently the person who ran that company the CEO Was a really bad person.

198
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,859
Speaker 0: Accusations not sexual abuse and harassment like.

199
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,925
Speaker 0: yeah now this is so.

200
00:14:46,025 --> 00:14:47,630
Speaker 1: I never bought any of their products.

201
00:14:47,751 --> 00:14:52,350
Speaker 1: But now I definitely won't buy any of their products and the person has been forced to step down.

202
00:14:52,571 --> 00:14:54,281
Speaker 1: But they still own the company.

203
00:14:54,724 --> 00:14:57,193
Speaker 1: So So don't.

204
00:14:57,715 --> 00:14:58,778
Speaker 1: I would say don't buy.

205
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:02,130
Speaker 1: I would encourage you not to buy any broken token organizing things.

206
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:05,642
Speaker 1: I would encourage you to stop caring so much about how.

207
00:15:06,023 --> 00:15:08,332
Speaker 1: you know pristine a piece of cardboard is Right.

208
00:15:08,392 --> 00:15:08,935
Speaker 1: The game is.

209
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:10,323
Speaker 1: you can still play the game.

210
00:15:10,484 --> 00:15:11,570
Speaker 1: Oh the game is in mint condition.

211
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:17,483
Speaker 0: Well, you know, you know what I look for specifically How quickly can I set the game up and tear the game down?

212
00:15:17,603 --> 00:15:19,730
Speaker 0: That is my primary interaction with these.

213
00:15:19,931 --> 00:15:22,530
Speaker 1: I'm perfectly happy with a box full of baggies.

214
00:15:22,751 --> 00:15:32,889
Speaker 0: Now the listener also points out that part of the shift is that there was that era In the late 90s early 2000s for some games came with really overwrought like trays in them.

215
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:42,773
Speaker 0: But today the primary reason those trays exist is bad Which was a fair point is just to ship the game to you once and they assume you're gonna do something different once it arrives Like doesn't matter.

216
00:15:42,813 --> 00:15:45,160
Speaker 1: after some some companies do but some don't.

217
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:48,370
Speaker 1: you know the inserts are all fancy and like you clearly they made that.

218
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:56,050
Speaker 0: Well They point out that some games Work with a company like gamer trays or one of those other companies that makes that kind of stuff to have a good solution in the box already.

219
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:06,429
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway I'm still a fan of lots of little baggies because usually that is the quickest way to organize the things in a way That's good for setting the game up quickly.

220
00:16:07,252 --> 00:16:09,729
Speaker 1: Yep, just put everything in baggies throw it all the inside.

221
00:16:10,171 --> 00:16:12,880
Speaker 0: Yep, broken token is basically completely fucked by this.

222
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,485
Speaker 0: 13 employees were laid off.

223
00:16:14,565 --> 00:16:15,669
Speaker 0: They're probably all their partners.

224
00:16:15,729 --> 00:16:19,982
Speaker 0: quit Companies basically done and frankly sorry, but that's good news.

225
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:22,910
Speaker 0: You can't let people like this exist in this industry at all.

226
00:16:23,151 --> 00:16:26,342
Speaker 1: But the problem is is the one shitty when the shitty person is a CEO?

227
00:16:26,382 --> 00:16:28,450
Speaker 1: which CEO is usually the shitty person, right?

228
00:16:28,731 --> 00:16:29,315
Speaker 1: It's like.

229
00:16:29,336 --> 00:16:30,484
Speaker 0: well, I hope that so.

230
00:16:30,505 --> 00:16:36,313
Speaker 1: this is a topic I was kind of saving for a Thursday, but I agree with that route, but the other the people who were laid off It's like they didn't.

231
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:40,450
Speaker 1: they weren't, you know bad people right, but now they lost their jobs.

232
00:16:41,711 --> 00:16:46,624
Speaker 0: This is a lot of people are using the old phrase one rotten apple spoils the bunch.

233
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,790
Speaker 0: really weird and wrong lately.

234
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,550
Speaker 0: So I got to set the record straight because this is another one of those situations.

235
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:57,310
Speaker 0: What that aphorism means is that if there's even one bad apple all the apples are fucked.

236
00:16:57,551 --> 00:17:01,690
Speaker 0: You got to get rid of that Apple as soon as possible no matter what or all the apples are gone.

237
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,184
Speaker 0: That is what that means.

238
00:17:03,244 --> 00:17:05,558
Speaker 0: It doesn't mean Oh only a few of the apples are bad.

239
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,290
Speaker 0: looking at you people who are trying to support the police right now.

240
00:17:10,432 --> 00:17:11,253
Speaker 0: But same thing here.

241
00:17:11,355 --> 00:17:15,669
Speaker 0: they let this Apple persist and now all the apples got fucked.

242
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:22,810
Speaker 1: hmm anyway And similar news right a company that I didn't know existed.

243
00:17:23,232 --> 00:17:24,898
Speaker 1: The CEO was a piece of shit.

244
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:30,983
Speaker 0: this company tripwire that made some video games Scott and I don't like they're not necessarily bad games.

245
00:17:31,044 --> 00:17:32,289
Speaker 0: It's not the kind of games we play.

246
00:17:33,114 --> 00:17:35,209
Speaker 1: What games does tripwire make?

247
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,881
Speaker 1: I don't even freaking know right?

248
00:17:39,043 --> 00:17:39,890
Speaker 0: I remember I looked it up.

249
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,378
Speaker 1: It was a big deal like killing floor.

250
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:44,225
Speaker 0: was that red orchestra that kind of stuff.

251
00:17:44,426 --> 00:17:50,630
Speaker 0: Okay, so killing floor That's like an FPS that I have is the only one I could think of off the top of my head.

252
00:17:50,690 --> 00:18:01,074
Speaker 1: So I'm looking through I guess like a game that I own Because I got it in so free in some bundle and I've never played it and it's just I fit it always my thoughts on It having never played it.

253
00:18:01,094 --> 00:18:15,670
Speaker 1: or that's an FPS that some small number of people still keep playing But isn't really big and popular But is like subsisting couldn't have said it better myself just has some fans for some reason and is sort of over there somewhere.

254
00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:21,878
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I Don't know what that is I've been a fan of heard of it like that before.

255
00:18:21,999 --> 00:18:22,199
Speaker 0: like.

256
00:18:22,661 --> 00:18:32,480
Speaker 0: I'm one of the 40 weirdos who were really into this game More than 40 in this case, but yeah the CEO of tripwire they did something bad - but they did.

257
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:47,897
Speaker 0: is they basically tweeted being in support of the egregious and undemocratic ban on abortion that was just passed in the American state of Texas, which to be very clear that is a straight-up like Incorrect opinion to have like.

258
00:18:48,118 --> 00:18:57,270
Speaker 0: I fully support you not being allowed to be in the game industry if you believe that Mmm, and it's not even just that he has this horrific belief.

259
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:04,850
Speaker 0: He expressed this belief from his public Twitter account that reflects directly on the company itself and all of its employees.

260
00:19:04,951 --> 00:19:07,448
Speaker 0: I think the employees even issued a statement saying fuck that guy.

261
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:11,221
Speaker 1: Yep, so they got rid of that guy and there's a new guy.

262
00:19:11,382 --> 00:19:13,709
Speaker 1: but then so the the new guy came in.

263
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:21,981
Speaker 1: However, I mean not that I was playing or buying any of their games except by accident But the new guy.

264
00:19:22,081 --> 00:19:24,895
Speaker 1: well, I guess apparently Possibly not.

265
00:19:25,136 --> 00:19:27,749
Speaker 1: who knows what their position is on the abortion thing?

266
00:19:28,332 --> 00:19:32,144
Speaker 1: But I think someone was like, you know, I think somebody tweeted.

267
00:19:32,164 --> 00:19:36,338
Speaker 1: I don't know that you might want to investigate this To make sure that it's true.

268
00:19:36,398 --> 00:19:46,604
Speaker 1: I'm not standing by this but I saw a tweet that Suggested that the new guy who came in Changed his like Twitter photo or profile or something.

269
00:19:46,704 --> 00:19:47,567
Speaker 0: I saw that.

270
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:51,840
Speaker 1: I saw that Because and he took it because he was like a gun dude, right?

271
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,846
Speaker 1: So gun dude has a high.

272
00:19:53,946 --> 00:19:59,729
Speaker 1: not it doesn't mean necessarily Right, but high correlation with not good, dude.

273
00:20:02,236 --> 00:20:05,876
Speaker 1: We don't know if they've fixed their problem But I'm probably and I never.

274
00:20:05,957 --> 00:20:10,050
Speaker 1: I wasn't buying anything from them to begin with so I don't know the need to change.

275
00:20:10,433 --> 00:20:12,770
Speaker 0: This gets it more into a fundamental like this.

276
00:20:13,151 --> 00:20:23,709
Speaker 0: This edges back into this conversation people are having as they discover that Nabisco is a horrible company that mistreats workers But they want to buy Pokemon Oreos and cross that picket line.

277
00:20:24,312 --> 00:20:27,221
Speaker 0: There's obviously in capitalism.

278
00:20:27,261 --> 00:20:28,144
Speaker 0: There's no such thing as that.

279
00:20:28,164 --> 00:20:33,509
Speaker 0: the ethical consumption like that is true But a lot of people like to use that as an excuse to keep doing their bullshit.

280
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:39,990
Speaker 0: There's because of the current extreme assault on abortion rights in America.

281
00:20:40,752 --> 00:20:49,770
Speaker 0: It is pretty much unethical to do business with a company that doesn't support abortion rights Or at least does not actively oppose abortion, right?

282
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:55,270
Speaker 1: Well, what's you know, the the big picture right is that you know corporate America, right?

283
00:20:55,550 --> 00:21:00,050
Speaker 1: Because they've been allowed to have influence in government via giving money to elected officials.

284
00:21:00,691 --> 00:21:11,850
Speaker 1: right now effectively in many ways, you know is either a monopolies that are more powerful than the government right or Controls some aspect of the government via money.

285
00:21:12,452 --> 00:21:17,290
Speaker 1: So now it's like we find ourselves appealing to companies via capitalism.

286
00:21:17,872 --> 00:21:19,797
Speaker 1: Right with you know, our energy.

287
00:21:19,857 --> 00:21:26,997
Speaker 1: that should just simply be energy in you know spent in a democratic You know public fashion, right?

288
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:30,890
Speaker 1: We now have to go to these companies rather than just going to the elected people.

289
00:21:31,111 --> 00:21:33,045
Speaker 1: Yeah, right with our with our voices.

290
00:21:33,065 --> 00:21:38,629
Speaker 1: So We'd like to change that so that's not the case which we're still trying to do.

291
00:21:39,191 --> 00:21:40,815
Speaker 1: But while that's the state of things.

292
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:54,510
Speaker 1: it's like, you know, if you're mad about some technology policy, it's like being mad at Apple Google Microsoft is probably gonna get you just as far as you know complaining to your senator about or whatever.

293
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,747
Speaker 1: So you got a complaint to all of them?

294
00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:05,590
Speaker 0: Yep, but also it's directly harmful to the people who could get pregnant And the people who love care about or know those people who might work for this company.

295
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:13,846
Speaker 0: I mean, we've already seen a bunch of other companies Literally giving employees money if they need to get the fuck out of Texas like that's gonna continue.

296
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:16,255
Speaker 0: So Torn banner.

297
00:22:16,315 --> 00:22:18,670
Speaker 0: They actually I see torn banners use a statement about this.

298
00:22:18,931 --> 00:22:27,249
Speaker 0: We do not share the opinion expressed in a recent tweet by the president of tripwire publisher of chivalry - this perspective is not shared by our team nor is it reflected in the games we create.

299
00:22:27,369 --> 00:22:39,650
Speaker 0: a Statement stands in opposition to what we believe about women's rights and you saw this across the industry of pretty much every non shitty company That interfaces with tripwire issued a statement like this basically immediately.

300
00:22:40,352 --> 00:22:45,769
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the other thing we're seeing lately, which is good is we're seeing companies that are.

301
00:22:45,849 --> 00:22:48,624
Speaker 1: you know All companies are shitty right because capitalism.

302
00:22:48,664 --> 00:22:53,914
Speaker 1: but we're seeing companies with you know less shitty Leadership right is.

303
00:22:53,954 --> 00:22:58,887
Speaker 1: what they're doing is when they discover that they are doing business with someone shitty, right?

304
00:22:59,188 --> 00:23:00,110
Speaker 1: They're cutting them off.

305
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:16,466
Speaker 1: they're being like, you know, I've seen people who had like Licensing deals to make a game right and then the the person who was making the game Revealed themselves milkshake duck and then the company that sold that, you know licensed the IP to them was like, you know What you can't make that game by?

306
00:23:17,571 --> 00:23:17,854
Speaker 1: Too bad.

307
00:23:17,954 --> 00:23:19,749
Speaker 1: We're not letting you make that game anymore because you suck.

308
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:20,733
Speaker 1: We don't want to.

309
00:23:20,793 --> 00:23:25,510
Speaker 1: you know, and it's just like, you know, that's that hurts way more than you know.

310
00:23:25,872 --> 00:23:28,189
Speaker 1: A bunch of fans refusing to buy the game.

311
00:23:28,732 --> 00:23:35,135
Speaker 1: There's always those bad fans who will buy it who might be enough in existence to you know get them and wall profits.

312
00:23:35,355 --> 00:23:45,450
Speaker 0: all of these kinds of things do clearly reek of either rainbow capitalism or progressive capitalism like Brands will often do things like this just for profit motives.

313
00:23:46,154 --> 00:23:56,578
Speaker 0: But there's an important aspect to that one it does deny resources in the long term to shitty people and At least Keep those resources from growing those shitty people.

314
00:23:56,658 --> 00:24:03,870
Speaker 0: even if it doesn't go to good people like at least it's almost like stopping the bleeding But - it might go to it might go it might go to a different shitty person.

315
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:15,093
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like at least but it still it over time disincentivizes like you can almost see having a piece-of-shit person in your company in a position of leadership as a Corporate risk.

316
00:24:15,574 --> 00:24:18,583
Speaker 1: and as soon as people look at look at blizzard still.

317
00:24:18,784 --> 00:24:25,881
Speaker 0: Yeah blizzards being sued by Shareholders because they failed to disclose their shitty sexist culture.

318
00:24:26,202 --> 00:24:35,029
Speaker 0: and they're arguing the shareholders that the stock dropped and the Company is materially harmed by the fact that shitty people work there and the company hid that from them.

319
00:24:35,089 --> 00:24:40,729
Speaker 0: the sit Like the shareholders are saying they should have been informed that shitty sexist people work at blizzard.

320
00:24:41,933 --> 00:24:45,864
Speaker 0: Mmm, that's a big deal and I can't say much more about that because of my day job.

321
00:24:45,924 --> 00:24:49,624
Speaker 0: So I'm not giving you investment advice I'm not a registered investment advisor.

322
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:54,119
Speaker 1: So The other thing that how do I become a registered investment advisor?

323
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:57,810
Speaker 0: take a test next time you want to be a registered investment advisor.

324
00:24:57,911 --> 00:24:58,698
Speaker 0: It's not that hard.

325
00:24:58,718 --> 00:25:00,151
Speaker 0: I Didn't.

326
00:25:00,192 --> 00:25:02,023
Speaker 1: that's why I was thinking it probably isn't that hard.

327
00:25:02,184 --> 00:25:03,030
Speaker 0: No, it's not that hard.

328
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:09,922
Speaker 0: You just say you have to learn a lot of proper nouns But it's not as complicated as you think.

329
00:25:09,962 --> 00:25:16,905
Speaker 0: it basically boils down to Basic ethics plus a basic understanding of capital markets and like how finance works.

330
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:18,710
Speaker 1: Did I make money doing this?

331
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:25,250
Speaker 0: Yes, registered investment advisor is literally a career And your advice doesn't even have to be fucking good.

332
00:25:26,073 --> 00:25:31,258
Speaker 1: Yes, and I'm saying is like I could I could just be like index funds the end Next person.

333
00:25:31,801 --> 00:25:33,330
Speaker 1: just tell us anything to every single person.

334
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:39,470
Speaker 0: All I'm gonna say is you would really think how the wealth management industry works is funny.

335
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:41,888
Speaker 0: That's kind of how it goes.

336
00:25:42,854 --> 00:25:43,959
Speaker 0: But I digress so.

337
00:25:44,281 --> 00:25:46,210
Speaker 0: but the important thing to internalize.

338
00:25:47,373 --> 00:26:07,928
Speaker 0: If you're depressed about the state of the world and you see this rainbow capitalism or progressive tinge capitalism as just being a cynical cash grab even if you're right and it is 100% a cynical cash grab it means the people with money and resources think that the winning side is the correct side.

339
00:26:08,712 --> 00:26:18,918
Speaker 0: They're saying we will make more money selling to gay people or more money selling to Good people than we will Continuing to hold on to evil people.

340
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,090
Speaker 0: that doesn't mean they're doing the right thing for the right reasons.

341
00:26:22,492 --> 00:26:31,322
Speaker 0: It means you're starting to win a little bit Mm-hmm as a point that just is worth talking about because people often lose that.

342
00:26:31,463 --> 00:26:34,632
Speaker 0: but also don't do business with shitty companies if you Can't avoid it.

343
00:26:34,672 --> 00:26:39,709
Speaker 0: Don't buy the Pokemon Oreos until Nabisco ends the strike by giving their workers rights.

344
00:26:40,755 --> 00:26:49,323
Speaker 0: Yep, so in some other news along these lines Twitch is Starting to do something about another kind of shitty person.

345
00:26:49,845 --> 00:26:51,390
Speaker 1: Well, we talked about this story already.

346
00:26:51,511 --> 00:26:54,246
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not gonna recap the whole thing to TL DL.

347
00:26:55,573 --> 00:27:14,947
Speaker 0: There are bots that are actively aggressively and at extreme scale harassing primarily black and LGBT streamers on Twitch like on a scale that is Right and the bots are run by, you know, obviously a small number of people Small number of people causing a large amount of damage.

348
00:27:15,188 --> 00:27:18,217
Speaker 0: twitch For all the other things going on.

349
00:27:18,257 --> 00:27:27,619
Speaker 0: They're doing one thing that I think is good and I want to see more of this They are suing two Individuals for coordinating this harassment and harassing people.

350
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:33,923
Speaker 1: so we figured out who two of the people are and they're like You know not just banning them from twitch, right?

351
00:27:34,205 --> 00:27:34,707
Speaker 1: They're going.

352
00:27:34,747 --> 00:27:38,001
Speaker 1: they're like saying Okay, we're gonna come after you and actually sue you the human being.

353
00:27:38,021 --> 00:27:38,945
Speaker 1: we figured out who you were.

354
00:27:39,226 --> 00:27:40,210
Speaker 1: you're running these botnets.

355
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:40,772
Speaker 1: Here we come.

356
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:41,395
Speaker 1: Right?

357
00:27:41,817 --> 00:27:42,038
Speaker 1: Yeah.

358
00:27:42,058 --> 00:27:43,685
Speaker 1: I hope you're ready to you know.

359
00:27:43,846 --> 00:27:50,405
Speaker 1: face a lawsuit Yep for get a lawyer because remember some shitty edgelord 4chan troll.

360
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:52,190
Speaker 0: They don't care about getting banned.

361
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,139
Speaker 0: They're behind seven proxies and have their botnet.

362
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:54,943
Speaker 1: They'll just make another.

363
00:27:55,304 --> 00:27:56,530
Speaker 1: they're making bots all the time.

364
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,875
Speaker 1: They can make another account too.

365
00:27:58,016 --> 00:28:10,070
Speaker 0: Yep, but if suddenly their mom or Most likely they're actually in their 30s now and they themselves get a lawsuit Legal consequences, that is a very different conversation.

366
00:28:10,311 --> 00:28:19,590
Speaker 1: This is this is why I keep saying I want to make a platform Where you it's like the same way that like a sports league finds players for misbehaving.

367
00:28:19,891 --> 00:28:27,959
Speaker 1: I want to make a some sort of you know, computing platform where if you fuck around Right, we find you we just take your money.

368
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:31,130
Speaker 1: It's like oh you you set a slur while you were playing that video game.

369
00:28:31,471 --> 00:28:32,595
Speaker 1: You just lost 100 bucks.

370
00:28:32,997 --> 00:28:34,824
Speaker 1: right go say slur again.

371
00:28:35,165 --> 00:28:36,369
Speaker 1: See what happens, right?

372
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:37,657
Speaker 1: I'm not even gonna ban you.

373
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:39,049
Speaker 1: give me another hundred bucks instead.

374
00:28:40,171 --> 00:28:41,921
Speaker 1: Yep, it think that could eat.

375
00:28:41,941 --> 00:28:43,228
Speaker 1: There's a way to make that work.

376
00:28:43,268 --> 00:28:50,713
Speaker 0: somehow There was an early simpler internet where generally things that happen on the internet stayed on the internet and you could treat it as a Different world.

377
00:28:51,217 --> 00:28:52,729
Speaker 0: we have long past that point.

378
00:28:53,151 --> 00:29:02,470
Speaker 0: so if harm is coming to people via the internet then Finding out and consequences has to come back to those same people via the legal system.

379
00:29:03,052 --> 00:29:05,080
Speaker 0: So this is Italy.

380
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:17,979
Speaker 1: really interesting to see how this plays out but it's all for not if the raids and stuff don't stop happening and twitch doesn't become a safe place for streamers of all kinds and This doesn't mean anything, right?

381
00:29:18,562 --> 00:29:26,028
Speaker 1: So, you know, it's like this is nice But it doesn't you know, show me that it's actually solving the root problem.

382
00:29:26,308 --> 00:29:28,756
Speaker 1: It's like, okay There's bad people and you took their money.

383
00:29:28,856 --> 00:29:31,705
Speaker 1: But is it any better to be on twitch?

384
00:29:32,046 --> 00:29:33,210
Speaker 1: No, it's still a shitty place.

385
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,496
Speaker 1: Well, you didn't do anything.

386
00:29:34,536 --> 00:29:39,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, because the other side of this is while this is good There are and we talked about in the show.

387
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:42,962
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna die because we got to do the main bit but we've talked about this before.

388
00:29:43,343 --> 00:29:48,217
Speaker 0: there are like 15 Objective-specific easy to implement things.

389
00:29:48,237 --> 00:29:52,270
Speaker 0: twitch could have done that they refused to do and I think they're still culpable for not stopping this.

390
00:29:52,672 --> 00:29:53,798
Speaker 0: They could have stopped this I think.

391
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:56,230
Speaker 1: see I'd like to see and here's this is the right.

392
00:29:56,310 --> 00:30:07,710
Speaker 1: So if they if the people who were the victims of harassment had money They should sue twitch and be like you could have implemented all these basic measures and you didn't right.

393
00:30:08,071 --> 00:30:11,589
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was harassed because you didn't do anything about it.

394
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:11,951
Speaker 1: Right.

395
00:30:12,132 --> 00:30:16,190
Speaker 1: All you did was no sue the two of the people you thought did it but you didn't do anything to stop it.

396
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,029
Speaker 1: You could have stopped it and you didn't right.

397
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:25,456
Speaker 1: Yep, just like if an arsonist burns your house down, but your house was also You know made poorly.

398
00:30:25,476 --> 00:30:26,579
Speaker 1: it was very flammable.

399
00:30:26,619 --> 00:30:40,525
Speaker 1: You could sue the person who made the house to probably right same kind of thing Not just arsonist but anyway things Of the day.

400
00:30:40,545 --> 00:30:44,077
Speaker 0: So this is just a really tiny thing.

401
00:30:44,117 --> 00:30:48,440
Speaker 0: This article is So short, but I laughed out loud.

402
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,267
Speaker 0: I think it's really funny and I just want to share it with you.

403
00:30:50,287 --> 00:30:53,520
Speaker 0: It is titled email addresses.

404
00:30:54,063 --> 00:31:00,750
Speaker 0: it would be really annoying to give out over the phone and These are email addresses like well, we're on a podcast.

405
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,074
Speaker 1: So you can't really give them out.

406
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:14,163
Speaker 0: Okay, like Mike underscore 2004 at yahoo.com or 1/1 the first just the number the second spelled out at hotmail.com Or so you.

407
00:31:14,264 --> 00:31:15,187
Speaker 1: obviously you can't.

408
00:31:15,448 --> 00:31:18,579
Speaker 1: this is not working because you're over the phone effectively speed up.

409
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,608
Speaker 1: Hey, you're gonna have to click on this.

410
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,718
Speaker 1: That's a thing of the day.

411
00:31:22,738 --> 00:31:25,880
Speaker 1: Yeah See the email addresses and then you'll understand.

412
00:31:26,221 --> 00:31:38,198
Speaker 0: I like it because there have been a couple of games like that bomb game the VR game where you're trying to diffuse the bomb That take advantage of this type of wordplay to make it very difficult to explain to the person in VR What the fuck they're supposed to do.

413
00:31:38,621 --> 00:31:47,420
Speaker 0: You're like cut the blue wire and they cut the blue wire the one labeled blue and it's that the one called the blue wire That is red like that kind of situation.

414
00:31:49,923 --> 00:31:51,818
Speaker 0: But I had this tickled my fancy what do you got?

415
00:31:52,661 --> 00:32:01,720
Speaker 1: So I didn't know until somewhat recently that in the game of badminton Right the shuttlecocks the like the right there's you know, the ones we used when you were a kid.

416
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,440
Speaker 1: You bought them in like a pack just like about tennis balls and they were pretty much plastic.

417
00:32:06,063 --> 00:32:09,440
Speaker 1: Right, some of them were slightly fancier, but they were still plastic.

418
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:20,873
Speaker 1: Apparently the in or in the competition serious badminton You have to get real ones made with like real feathers Like it's like some specific thing like a left side of a goose.

419
00:32:20,914 --> 00:32:21,917
Speaker 1: I don't even know what the hell it is.

420
00:32:25,282 --> 00:32:26,887
Speaker 1: It is it because they're all the same way or so?

421
00:32:26,948 --> 00:32:27,309
Speaker 1: I forget?

422
00:32:27,329 --> 00:32:29,817
Speaker 1: I read it somewhere but there is there.

423
00:32:29,877 --> 00:32:31,646
Speaker 1: apparently, you know There's the one place.

424
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:34,000
Speaker 0: I didn't Google to see if anyone's ever said that before?

425
00:32:35,264 --> 00:32:36,620
Speaker 1: It's it's something like that.

426
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:43,400
Speaker 1: But anyway Someone posted this on Twitter this video and it shows people in a village in India where there used to be several.

427
00:32:43,803 --> 00:32:57,491
Speaker 0: So the phrase the left side of a goose returns exactly one Google result in the entire world and it is shuttlecock online dot page dot TL Something like that.

428
00:32:57,531 --> 00:33:04,699
Speaker 0: Yeah I've never said I have not seen a search that returned a single result in like seven years.

429
00:33:05,982 --> 00:33:07,054
Speaker 0: This is amazing.

430
00:33:08,822 --> 00:33:17,102
Speaker 1: Yeah, bad men show Yeah feathers of light there, yeah, so They also ducks, right?

431
00:33:17,142 --> 00:33:30,830
Speaker 1: But anyway, so this place the video here shows this place in India where they're making Shuttle cocks by hand from basically duck feathers that came from a nearby, you know duck slaughterhouse.

432
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:34,770
Speaker 1: So it's like they just buy the feathers by the you know in big bundles right for cheap.

433
00:33:36,471 --> 00:33:44,939
Speaker 1: And it's there used to be a lot of places that did this and this is the only place still doing it by hand Because they're not only and they're not only making not fake ones.

434
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:48,870
Speaker 1: They're real feathered ones, but they're also doing it by hand.

435
00:33:48,890 --> 00:34:01,329
Speaker 1: There's like almost no machines involved because you could just dump the feathers into a machine that makes them also right instead of doing it by hand, so It's pretty fascinating to see some you know, some handy work like this.

436
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:07,450
Speaker 1: but also Apparently I was not aware of this but it makes perfect sense.

437
00:34:07,992 --> 00:34:13,293
Speaker 1: These shuttlecocks fly completely differently from the ones you would buy You're.

438
00:34:13,754 --> 00:34:18,429
Speaker 1: it's not like tennis where like you buy some yellow balls and like yeah, that's what they're using to play tennis, right?

439
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:18,772
Speaker 1: You're not.

440
00:34:19,155 --> 00:34:28,230
Speaker 1: it's like if you stay are at home Playing badminton with the plastic ones from the store and then you want to go and play real badminton.

441
00:34:28,571 --> 00:34:34,190
Speaker 1: You're gonna be way off right because they're gonna for the real badminton uses the real feather ones only.

442
00:34:34,792 --> 00:34:37,219
Speaker 1: But real badminton is thinking about changing up the.

443
00:34:37,521 --> 00:34:50,603
Speaker 1: you know, the official rule probably should Right, but you got to get one that flies Correct or otherwise is basically different sport because it's so dramatically different Like it would be like the difference between like duck pin bowling and regular bowling.

444
00:34:50,623 --> 00:34:59,890
Speaker 0: so one could one could argue that if Hockey pucks required immense animal suffering to create that maybe if we change the way hockey pucks work, that would be fine.

445
00:35:00,111 --> 00:35:07,005
Speaker 1: Well, I mean there are some articles I've seen that are like yeah, there's places that are plucking live You know animals to get the feathers and that's fucked up.

446
00:35:07,045 --> 00:35:07,729
Speaker 1: Don't be doing that.

447
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,837
Speaker 1: But it seems like this place.

448
00:35:09,937 --> 00:35:11,041
Speaker 1: they weren't doing that.

449
00:35:11,121 --> 00:35:12,666
Speaker 1: at least the video doesn't say they were.

450
00:35:12,706 --> 00:35:13,870
Speaker 1: who knows what the reality is?

451
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:19,870
Speaker 1: But it's like yeah, if you're killing a duck anyway to make duck meat you might as well use the feathers.

452
00:35:20,631 --> 00:35:21,759
Speaker 0: Yeah, absolutely use they.

453
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:23,330
Speaker 0: use all of the left side of the goose.

454
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:40,270
Speaker 0: Yeah in the meta moment the duck bones to make Halloween decor The geek nice book club book Taylor Genji powering through it still gonna do the show in the next month or so, I think The next month and at this the end October 2022.

455
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,981
Speaker 0: I think in October we can do this show.

456
00:35:42,001 --> 00:35:43,370
Speaker 0: I'm still sitting my eyes on October.

457
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:44,685
Speaker 1: We'll see.

458
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:47,737
Speaker 0: You know, just power through it.

459
00:35:47,777 --> 00:35:48,681
Speaker 0: My if I just don't.

460
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:51,150
Speaker 0: if you're not sure who someone is you'll figure it out later.

461
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,534
Speaker 0: I I still.

462
00:35:52,975 --> 00:35:58,590
Speaker 0: I only remember chapters by who was Genji having sex with or trying to have sex within that chapter?

463
00:35:59,051 --> 00:36:03,064
Speaker 1: And if I think the last couple chapters I read he wasn't having trying to have sex with anybody.

464
00:36:03,305 --> 00:36:07,174
Speaker 0: No, that does happen occasionally That does.

465
00:36:07,194 --> 00:36:12,848
Speaker 0: there are some chapters where he did not actually try to have sex with anyone But then there are chapters where he makes up for that.

466
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:19,173
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway, uh I Don't have anything else.

467
00:36:19,193 --> 00:36:23,450
Speaker 0: There's no conventions coming up like magfest was announced, but that's too far in the future.

468
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:24,574
Speaker 1: Who knows if we're going to that?

469
00:36:24,755 --> 00:36:26,903
Speaker 0: Yep, not going to pack some packs.

470
00:36:26,943 --> 00:36:28,690
Speaker 1: Unplugged has not had any announcements.

471
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:30,921
Speaker 1: We presume it's probably gonna happen.

472
00:36:30,942 --> 00:36:31,846
Speaker 1: We don't know anything.

473
00:36:31,906 --> 00:36:35,220
Speaker 1: So yeah Who knows what's gonna be going on there?

474
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:40,017
Speaker 0: Even if peck south meets all of our requirements I'm really not willing to do business in Texas.

475
00:36:40,057 --> 00:36:41,141
Speaker 0: So I ain't go to peck south.

476
00:36:41,181 --> 00:36:41,402
Speaker 0: Yeah.

477
00:36:41,964 --> 00:36:43,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, Connecticut just happened.

478
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:44,854
Speaker 1: People were there.

479
00:36:45,195 --> 00:36:48,786
Speaker 1: I know yeah, but they said it was way less crowded than usual.

480
00:36:48,987 --> 00:36:51,013
Speaker 1: Obviously, we weren't there Yep, which good.

481
00:36:51,194 --> 00:36:54,105
Speaker 0: I do want to go back to Connecticut, but not during a global pandemic.

482
00:36:54,285 --> 00:36:57,834
Speaker 0: It's not worth risking my life Yep, who knows?

483
00:36:58,115 --> 00:36:59,839
Speaker 0: so otherwise just follow us on the internet.

484
00:36:59,859 --> 00:37:06,715
Speaker 0: There's a lively live stream with a surprising amount of chatter right now And we'll just get into the main bit.

485
00:37:06,955 --> 00:37:11,870
Speaker 0: We played a game a game called oath chronicles of empire in exile.

486
00:37:12,732 --> 00:37:18,668
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the people who brought you root the same designer Cole Worley, I think that's how you pronounce his last name.

487
00:37:18,688 --> 00:37:22,775
Speaker 1: Sorry Cole and The artist everyone loves is it?

488
00:37:22,876 --> 00:37:24,059
Speaker 1: Kyle Ferren?

489
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,405
Speaker 1: is the name of the artist that everybody loves?

490
00:37:26,445 --> 00:37:27,869
Speaker 0: who does the art Cal Ferren?

491
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:29,512
Speaker 1: All right.

492
00:37:29,552 --> 00:37:34,650
Speaker 0: I was right Kyle for yeah, like the holy trinity of amazing game art, right?

493
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:39,545
Speaker 1: It was basically like hey this this team brought you root this amazing mega hit game.

494
00:37:39,605 --> 00:37:41,130
Speaker 1: Let's make another game called oath.

495
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:41,809
Speaker 1: So what is oath?

496
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:48,458
Speaker 1: Oath is nothing like root really although you can see some similarities right because you know same designer and

497
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:56,988
Speaker 0: I saw someone said it best as it's almost like if you took root and Zoomed way out both physically and in terms of time and to

498
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:58,169
Speaker 1: the point I don't know.

499
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:05,544
Speaker 1: I think you're zooming it to pay your zooming out in terms of time But you're zooming in like you're just one person one character or one person.

500
00:38:05,564 --> 00:38:13,969
Speaker 1: You've got like your entourage And yeah, but you're still one dude right whereas in route you're like a kingdom all right, yeah.

501
00:38:14,732 --> 00:38:16,237
Speaker 1: Anyway, so what's oath?

502
00:38:16,799 --> 00:38:20,190
Speaker 1: the idea in oath is that there is this sort of Kingdom, right?

503
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:21,975
Speaker 1: It has a main area.

504
00:38:22,156 --> 00:38:28,950
Speaker 1: It has you know, sort of a suburban villages area and then it's got a faraway hinterlands area, right.

505
00:38:30,672 --> 00:38:34,490
Speaker 1: And over time, you know the kingdoms shit happens, right?

506
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:44,690
Speaker 1: There's a Chancellor who rules they sometimes they continued and they keep ruling Sometimes and they build things up and you know, the kingdom waxes and wanes over, you know and things happen.

507
00:38:45,991 --> 00:39:03,118
Speaker 1: And when you sit down to play oath, you are playing one chapter in the story of the kingdom, right you start out basically with the status quo of the kingdom as it was right the Chancellor and the stuff that they were Controlling is already set.

508
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,250
Speaker 1: So if the Chancellor ended it's a legacy game, right?

509
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:09,430
Speaker 1: So the Chancellor ended the last game in a strong position.

510
00:39:09,853 --> 00:39:29,149
Speaker 1: They're gonna start the game in a big strong position Yeah, and if they if they right and then me if it may be You know and the thing is whoever won that may might not have been the chant the person the Chancellor that started last time one last time but whoever You know, let's say one of the other Non Chancellor players won the game last time.

511
00:39:29,571 --> 00:39:36,230
Speaker 1: Well, at least story wise the Chancellor of the current game is whoever won the last game, right?

512
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:39,069
Speaker 1: It might have been some exile or a citizen or who knows what right?

513
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:45,750
Speaker 1: So you said you set up the game according to how the last game ended and then you play out another chapter.

514
00:39:45,971 --> 00:39:48,299
Speaker 1: And what happens is you have the the Chancellor.

515
00:39:48,479 --> 00:39:49,463
Speaker 1: they start out with all the stuff.

516
00:39:50,165 --> 00:39:53,435
Speaker 1: there may be Characters who are citizens.

517
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:56,504
Speaker 1: their citizens are on the Chancellor's side.

518
00:39:56,905 --> 00:39:58,470
Speaker 1: they use the Chancellor's units.

519
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:06,970
Speaker 1: They don't have their own units, but their goal is to a get the Chancellor to win But be six become the successor to the Chancellor.

520
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:13,250
Speaker 1: So they become the new Chancellor even though the team Chancellor won and then everyone else is an exile.

521
00:40:13,773 --> 00:40:16,490
Speaker 1: Who is basically trying to overthrow in some manner?

522
00:40:18,423 --> 00:40:22,844
Speaker 1: and You know, basically you're just this individual and you travel.

523
00:40:23,065 --> 00:40:23,707
Speaker 1: it's every.

524
00:40:23,907 --> 00:40:28,049
Speaker 1: the thing about this game I love the most is that every action you do in the game?

525
00:40:28,854 --> 00:40:31,400
Speaker 1: right speaks narratively.

526
00:40:32,213 --> 00:40:35,910
Speaker 1: The mechanics and the narrative just like, you know merge completely the game.

527
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:40,005
Speaker 1: We're just not a role-playing game, but you could make it one kinda.

528
00:40:40,467 --> 00:40:44,018
Speaker 0: Yep, like in the game We just played because of what was happening on the board.

529
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:55,726
Speaker 0: my army like my pop by base of power consisted of a bunch of Geriatrics living in a tent city and that's just that's what my army consisted of.

530
00:40:55,766 --> 00:40:57,030
Speaker 0: That's how things shook down.

531
00:40:57,431 --> 00:40:58,274
Speaker 0: What are they after?

532
00:40:58,375 --> 00:40:59,338
Speaker 0: what are their motivations?

533
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:02,810
Speaker 0: You can infer that pretty heavily from the events that happen in the game itself.

534
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:05,377
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like every single act.

535
00:41:05,418 --> 00:41:06,260
Speaker 1: So there's a bunch of.

536
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,624
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna talk about all the rules.

537
00:41:07,684 --> 00:41:08,407
Speaker 1: It'll take forever.

538
00:41:08,908 --> 00:41:09,530
Speaker 1: read them yourself.

539
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:17,890
Speaker 1: They're free online But a simple action in the game would be like muster right which lets you add dudes add war bands to your little entourage.

540
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,776
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you're at.

541
00:41:19,836 --> 00:41:23,990
Speaker 1: you are physically your pawn which represents you the character, right?

542
00:41:24,291 --> 00:41:25,990
Speaker 1: You you you're at a location.

543
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:31,266
Speaker 1: Maybe you're in the hinterlands and in the hinterlands is a forest right.

544
00:41:31,688 --> 00:41:34,061
Speaker 1: and in the forest There's some cards next to the forest.

545
00:41:34,102 --> 00:41:39,523
Speaker 1: the cards have denizens Right people who live in that forest and some some locations.

546
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:41,168
Speaker 1: like we had a we had like what was it?

547
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:41,890
Speaker 1: a sunken city?

548
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:44,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, it has a maximum space for zero.

549
00:41:44,539 --> 00:41:45,824
Speaker 1: No one can live there as zero.

550
00:41:45,844 --> 00:41:47,150
Speaker 1: You're not allowed to have denizens there.

551
00:41:47,512 --> 00:41:50,470
Speaker 0: There's a pile of nonsense there a bunch of relics, right?

552
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:54,710
Speaker 1: But like a pleasant veil might have three spots for denizens or something.

553
00:41:54,790 --> 00:42:00,410
Speaker 1: So you go there into some denizens and you see and one of the denizens is the old people the elders, right?

554
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:01,093
Speaker 1: They're living there.

555
00:42:01,514 --> 00:42:02,539
Speaker 1: So you want to muster.

556
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:03,382
Speaker 1: so you do.

557
00:42:03,462 --> 00:42:15,243
Speaker 1: is you take favor Right and you give the favor to the elders and then you add two war bands To your board and it's like that tells a little.

558
00:42:15,263 --> 00:42:18,756
Speaker 1: you just did one action in the game But it tells this story of.

559
00:42:19,057 --> 00:42:23,070
Speaker 1: I did a favor for the old people and some old people joined my army.

560
00:42:23,491 --> 00:42:28,807
Speaker 0: Yeah, or the old people told me secrets or something right you trade with the old people.

561
00:42:28,827 --> 00:42:29,148
Speaker 1: I'll do.

562
00:42:29,208 --> 00:42:31,582
Speaker 1: hey old people I'll do you a favor if you tell me a secret.

563
00:42:31,683 --> 00:42:34,548
Speaker 1: or hey old people I'll tell you secrets if you do me a favor.

564
00:42:34,568 --> 00:42:36,713
Speaker 1: or You know all kind.

565
00:42:36,833 --> 00:42:49,810
Speaker 1: everything you do in the game is something along those lines that tells a little mini story and those little mini Stories add up into the big big story and then the game ends, right?

566
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:51,475
Speaker 1: And you figure out who is gonna be.

567
00:42:51,495 --> 00:42:55,327
Speaker 1: you know, who is who is ruling the kingdom next time right?

568
00:42:55,407 --> 00:42:56,149
Speaker 1: versus this time?

569
00:42:57,692 --> 00:43:00,747
Speaker 1: And there's all sorts of fun things to interact with right?

570
00:43:00,788 --> 00:43:03,777
Speaker 1: You've got The denizens, right?

571
00:43:03,797 --> 00:43:04,601
Speaker 1: You got some cards.

572
00:43:04,621 --> 00:43:06,510
Speaker 1: You got some cards that are your advisors, right?

573
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:09,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're busy denizens that walk around with you everywhere.

574
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,970
Speaker 1: They're just only working with you not with anyone else.

575
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:14,761
Speaker 0: There's all these relics and a fun thing another game.

576
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:16,307
Speaker 1: You know, it's amazing magic items.

577
00:43:16,347 --> 00:43:16,749
Speaker 1: You can get.

578
00:43:16,769 --> 00:43:18,153
Speaker 0: there's a game We'll talk about another time.

579
00:43:18,193 --> 00:43:26,190
Speaker 0: We'll review called fortress the freedman freeze game that does something similar in that We haven't seen the deck.

580
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:33,772
Speaker 0: So like I'll go somewhere and see an art of relic and that relic just the way the game is constructed and the way you play Each round.

581
00:43:34,353 --> 00:43:41,677
Speaker 0: maybe no other human has ever seen at this table before so I know there's people currently playing Haven't looked up all the card spoilers.

582
00:43:41,978 --> 00:43:43,142
Speaker 0: Yeah, which I'm avoiding.

583
00:43:43,222 --> 00:43:44,828
Speaker 0: so like yeah, it was interesting too.

584
00:43:44,908 --> 00:43:45,450
Speaker 0: I saw a relic.

585
00:43:45,491 --> 00:43:49,484
Speaker 0: I was like, oh, okay that seems like a reasonable thing for a game to do.

586
00:43:49,524 --> 00:43:56,584
Speaker 0: and then I saw another relic and That relic seems so powerful and weird that it gave me pause to consider.

587
00:43:56,905 --> 00:43:58,670
Speaker 0: What the fuck other relics might I run into?

588
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:03,645
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like yeah because every time when you finish a game you remove you.

589
00:44:03,665 --> 00:44:05,010
Speaker 1: basically you start the game with a deck.

590
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:07,943
Speaker 1: They give you and but there's a bunch more cards in the box.

591
00:44:08,244 --> 00:44:19,850
Speaker 1: when you finish a game Whoever one is gonna make some decisions right relating to the what's had the state of the board and They're basically gonna remove some cards from the deck and add more car add six cards to the deck.

592
00:44:20,372 --> 00:44:24,430
Speaker 1: So you're constantly cycling out and in cards, right?

593
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:28,482
Speaker 1: And so the next time you play you're gonna see some stuff you're familiar with.

594
00:44:28,602 --> 00:44:31,350
Speaker 1: but you know the kingdom change over time.

595
00:44:31,852 --> 00:44:33,159
Speaker 1: The kingdom is changing right.

596
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:35,330
Speaker 1: some people who used to live here don't live here anymore.

597
00:44:35,732 --> 00:44:43,786
Speaker 1: Some new people showed up some people, you know, but most of it is Basically the same at least as of last game but compared to ten games ago.

598
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:44,990
Speaker 1: It's completely different, right?

599
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:48,926
Speaker 1: It's been so long since then, you know, there's no one alive from ten games.

600
00:44:49,006 --> 00:44:50,030
Speaker 1: It's been so long.

601
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:53,179
Speaker 1: So you're telling this long story.

602
00:44:53,922 --> 00:44:55,950
Speaker 1: the addition I got I don't know if the non.

603
00:44:56,091 --> 00:44:59,069
Speaker 1: Okay, I didn't like pay extra for extra Kickstarter biz.

604
00:44:59,251 --> 00:45:18,110
Speaker 1: I just kick-started at the level of give me the game But it came with metal favor tokens, oh they feel so nice special rosin secret book tokens And also this little leathery book to write your Chronicle in right because it's people are making art in those Chronicle books.

605
00:45:18,896 --> 00:45:20,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I'm like the Chronicle book.

606
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:28,703
Speaker 1: It's like you have one page per game that you write down what the hell happened and then you build this Chronicle Right of what happened in the kingdom over time.

607
00:45:28,763 --> 00:45:30,230
Speaker 1: You keep playing this game over and over.

608
00:45:30,451 --> 00:45:35,350
Speaker 0: Yep, like I guess I'm just flipping through a board game geek this one person they posted there.

609
00:45:35,853 --> 00:45:40,479
Speaker 0: They had one page where I guess the Fox people Became the chance like exile.

610
00:45:40,519 --> 00:45:41,584
Speaker 0: Yeah, yep, like they won.

611
00:45:42,046 --> 00:45:43,070
Speaker 0: so they didn't write any words.

612
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:49,190
Speaker 0: They just drew a picture of an evil looking Fox with like some shadowy flame and it just says shrouded rebellion.

613
00:45:49,753 --> 00:45:50,939
Speaker 0: They didn't write anything else.

614
00:45:51,301 --> 00:45:56,510
Speaker 0: So whatever the fuck happened in that game I feel like the foxes got up to some bad news business and won the game.

615
00:45:57,230 --> 00:46:01,036
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Yeah But yeah, it's just.

616
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:03,250
Speaker 1: I don't know how else to describe the game.

617
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:06,230
Speaker 1: It's oh, so I guess let the rules a little bit a little bit rules, right?

618
00:46:06,531 --> 00:46:07,997
Speaker 1: So it's an action point game.

619
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,630
Speaker 1: you on your turn right you go.

620
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:12,583
Speaker 1: This is I think the only negative about the game.

621
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:13,450
Speaker 1: Is that much like root?

622
00:46:13,852 --> 00:46:16,710
Speaker 1: It is still a game where you don't do much when it's not your turn.

623
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:21,310
Speaker 1: Yep, so on your turn you do a whole bunch of stuff and then it's the next person's turn.

624
00:46:21,391 --> 00:46:25,542
Speaker 1: So if you're playing with a lot of players I think you know, it lets you go from two to six.

625
00:46:25,602 --> 00:46:27,370
Speaker 1: you play two you need an AI player.

626
00:46:27,775 --> 00:46:28,789
Speaker 1: I don't think that that's great.

627
00:46:29,991 --> 00:46:40,485
Speaker 1: Five and six I think is too many because you're it takes so long and the players who have the last turn order at a bit Of a disadvantage because the game starts four turns worth of stuff happens.

628
00:46:40,505 --> 00:46:41,630
Speaker 1: then they get their first turn.

629
00:46:41,731 --> 00:46:42,785
Speaker 1: It's like oh my god, right?

630
00:46:44,193 --> 00:46:46,050
Speaker 1: And there's too much waiting and it takes too long.

631
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:55,470
Speaker 0: I think three or four players is ideal though if everyone is fully fluent in the mechanics I think the game would move literally twice as fast as our early the game.

632
00:46:55,932 --> 00:46:58,925
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know the game is actually not a slow game.

633
00:46:59,005 --> 00:47:00,150
Speaker 1: if everyone knows how to play.

634
00:47:00,371 --> 00:47:01,977
Speaker 1: It's the first time you play.

635
00:47:01,997 --> 00:47:15,010
Speaker 1: you're gonna need to spend a lot of time rule learning and card reading And probably the second time and if you don't play with the same exact people again You're gonna still spend time card reading and rule learning and some exceptions to the rules are gonna get you.

636
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:20,269
Speaker 1: But if you're playing with people who got good at the game you can under two hours easily, right?

637
00:47:21,133 --> 00:47:23,949
Speaker 1: And there's a lot of variance in that as well depending on how the game ends.

638
00:47:24,331 --> 00:47:32,455
Speaker 1: But you on your turn you have this supply meter and you just spend action points to do Actions, there's a whole list of actions

639
00:47:32,575 --> 00:47:39,173
Speaker 0: stuff like travel out to the hinterlands or recruit some armies or go get this relic or fucking Attack someone

640
00:47:39,836 --> 00:47:45,215
Speaker 1: and some actions are free like put some denizens out, you know Go, you know, I guess not.

641
00:47:45,255 --> 00:47:51,197
Speaker 1: it's not for you to go exploring and look for some cards, you know to get more cards But it's a thing you can do all right.

642
00:47:51,257 --> 00:48:00,181
Speaker 1: battling obviously is an action all kinds of actions you do you spend your points But if you run out of supplies Right narrative again, you're spending some things you want to do.

643
00:48:00,482 --> 00:48:03,893
Speaker 1: cost supplies moving around cost supplies You're traveling.

644
00:48:03,954 --> 00:48:04,155
Speaker 1: right.

645
00:48:04,275 --> 00:48:07,270
Speaker 1: obviously that cost supplies the farther you travel the more supplies it costs.

646
00:48:07,832 --> 00:48:15,020
Speaker 1: But just telling someone who's hanging out with you, right like one of your advisors to like Hey, you should you should build you should stay here.

647
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:15,662
Speaker 1: I'm gonna leave.

648
00:48:16,024 --> 00:48:17,590
Speaker 1: that doesn't cost any supplies, right?

649
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:19,878
Speaker 1: You're just saying hey stay here giving someone an order.

650
00:48:19,918 --> 00:48:29,170
Speaker 1: It takes two seconds, right and you go around doing these things You know telling you a little story on your turn and then you say you're done and then you refresh your supply.

651
00:48:29,792 --> 00:48:32,541
Speaker 1: You refresh your supply according to how bigger.

652
00:48:32,601 --> 00:48:35,170
Speaker 1: if your army is real big you have less supplies.

653
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:39,024
Speaker 1: It's harder to move around and you got to feed all these frickin soldiers or whatever.

654
00:48:39,566 --> 00:48:42,236
Speaker 1: if your army is real small Then you got more supplies.

655
00:48:42,276 --> 00:48:43,562
Speaker 1: You can do more stuff, right?

656
00:48:43,582 --> 00:48:45,330
Speaker 1: You're not hanging around with a big crowd again.

657
00:48:45,591 --> 00:48:48,149
Speaker 1: Narratives that make sense with the mechanic, right?

658
00:48:49,792 --> 00:48:52,830
Speaker 1: So you just do this and there's every game.

659
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:59,490
Speaker 1: There's gonna be this victory condition the oath and whoever is currently leading is gonna have the oathkeeper banner.

660
00:49:00,012 --> 00:49:08,406
Speaker 1: the Chancellor always starts with it because they're always in the strong position at the start of the game and They just have it because they're.

661
00:49:08,849 --> 00:49:10,219
Speaker 1: you know They're no matter what.

662
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:19,920
Speaker 1: at the start of the game The board will be in such a state that the chant the starting Chancellor is Meeting the victory condition more than anyone else no matter what.

663
00:49:20,663 --> 00:49:25,124
Speaker 1: but as soon as the game goes on someone else Right could take that away from them.

664
00:49:25,326 --> 00:49:25,950
Speaker 1: It's possible.

665
00:49:27,191 --> 00:49:34,413
Speaker 1: And if they do and they hold on to that oath if they keep that oath long enough and you think oh well How are they gonna do this?

666
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:35,275
Speaker 1: Right?

667
00:49:35,576 --> 00:49:39,709
Speaker 1: Well, the Chancellor just naturally loses power as the game goes on.

668
00:49:40,031 --> 00:49:41,310
Speaker 1: It's just structured in that way.

669
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:43,829
Speaker 1: So if the game goes on too long the Chancellor is gonna get weak.

670
00:49:44,632 --> 00:49:50,010
Speaker 1: The Chancellor can get strength by getting people to become citizens and join their team if they weren't citizens at the start.

671
00:49:50,552 --> 00:49:59,109
Speaker 1: But if a non citizen holds that oath for too long I think two laps around the table then they win right because the Chancellor lost the their oath.

672
00:50:00,212 --> 00:50:00,976
Speaker 1: Another way to win.

673
00:50:01,921 --> 00:50:07,582
Speaker 1: if somebody is not the Chancellor They're in exile there's visions and if they they have a vision.

674
00:50:07,602 --> 00:50:10,150
Speaker 1: right I had a vision of an empire.

675
00:50:10,291 --> 00:50:15,192
Speaker 1: Right and you fulfill the vision somehow Right.

676
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:18,846
Speaker 0: Well, they're gonna be nine small mushrooms in a row.

677
00:50:18,966 --> 00:50:21,434
Speaker 0: this I so decree Right you have.

678
00:50:21,454 --> 00:50:27,160
Speaker 1: if you have if you're in exile and you have a vision and you bring it about It's like that's such a tremendous thing.

679
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:27,321
Speaker 1: Right?

680
00:50:27,341 --> 00:50:31,918
Speaker 1: You're a visionary figure in the society And it came true.

681
00:50:32,421 --> 00:50:33,929
Speaker 1: well then you beat that's it you win.

682
00:50:35,192 --> 00:50:53,565
Speaker 1: But just to make a vision happen It's like you have to play the vision So everyone sees it on your turn and then it has to go all the way around the board and at the start of your Turn the vision has to be fulfilled still and that's difficult to do because everyone sees it and tries to mess it up sort of Like dune where it's like I'm winning on my turn.

683
00:50:53,605 --> 00:50:56,111
Speaker 1: who's gonna stop me Becomes.

684
00:50:56,633 --> 00:51:08,790
Speaker 0: one or more players will win if the game gets back around to them and the game becomes Really like not to get into the details of the mechanics because again It would just take too much time and it would also be too hard to explain without visual aids.

685
00:51:09,272 --> 00:51:12,989
Speaker 0: but what I would say is the way you are engaging with the game is.

686
00:51:13,971 --> 00:51:24,530
Speaker 0: You were trying to prevent the person who is currently winning from actually winning when it gets around to them while posturing To be ready to be the person who will win after they have failed.

687
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:29,566
Speaker 1: Yep, and the last thing is if the Chancellor just holds on to the oath, right?

688
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:32,242
Speaker 1: They mate they stay strong They remain the oathkeeper.

689
00:51:32,262 --> 00:51:37,108
Speaker 1: then Of halfway through the game the game can only ever be eight rounds.

690
00:51:37,148 --> 00:51:41,288
Speaker 1: long After the fifth round, I think they get to roll a d6.

691
00:51:43,831 --> 00:51:44,317
Speaker 0: They do.

692
00:51:44,338 --> 00:51:50,841
Speaker 1: they do If it comes up on a six exactly they win.

693
00:51:50,921 --> 00:51:57,447
Speaker 1: but if they get it if they get to go another round Let's say they make it to the sixth round and there's still the oathkeeper.

694
00:51:57,889 --> 00:52:02,594
Speaker 1: now They win on like a five or a six and basically the odds of them winning keep Increasing.

695
00:52:03,097 --> 00:52:10,414
Speaker 1: if they're managed to hold on to the oath Right as the game nears the eighth round if they're holding on to it at the eighth round They just win.

696
00:52:10,978 --> 00:52:12,890
Speaker 1: if not, there's like a list of things that happen.

697
00:52:13,011 --> 00:52:15,130
Speaker 0: So the but the fun part about the fight.

698
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:21,330
Speaker 0: It really gives this feeling of like you've got to take your shot or they're like they're just too powerful.

699
00:52:22,235 --> 00:52:30,204
Speaker 1: And then the final thing is if the Chancellor does win But one of these citizens has met the successor goal.

700
00:52:30,565 --> 00:52:32,310
Speaker 1: They win instead of the Chancellor.

701
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:33,988
Speaker 1: So it's like the Chancellor wants to win.

702
00:52:34,672 --> 00:52:40,690
Speaker 1: But it's like if someone else has that's on your team is meeting this successor goal.

703
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:46,430
Speaker 1: It's like you have to find some way to like bring them down without hurting the team because otherwise you don't win.

704
00:52:46,661 --> 00:52:50,902
Speaker 0: Yeah Like all the outcasts to a degree of the exiles have to sort of work together at least like.

705
00:52:51,403 --> 00:53:05,010
Speaker 0: I wouldn't antagonize a fellow exile Early in the game necessarily unless I had some reason to like a vision in my hand that I need to set myself up for Later, so the game ends up simulating this feeling of court intrigue.

706
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:13,110
Speaker 1: pretty well Mmm, and I guess the last the last thing is that you know nothing in the game.

707
00:53:13,673 --> 00:53:15,142
Speaker 1: It's like you know is like you think.

708
00:53:15,182 --> 00:53:16,550
Speaker 1: oh the Chancellor is like special.

709
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:19,170
Speaker 1: It's like they're a little special, but really it's unlike root.

710
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:20,414
Speaker 1: It's very symmetrical.

711
00:53:20,534 --> 00:53:25,468
Speaker 1: everyone does the same things on their turn the same actions the same supply thing.

712
00:53:25,508 --> 00:53:26,090
Speaker 1: basically.

713
00:53:27,232 --> 00:53:31,168
Speaker 1: For example the Chancellor has this like scepter like this royal scepter thing.

714
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:31,690
Speaker 1: It's a relic.

715
00:53:32,032 --> 00:53:33,642
Speaker 1: It's just a relic like any other relic.

716
00:53:33,663 --> 00:53:34,367
Speaker 0: just steal it.

717
00:53:35,432 --> 00:53:42,457
Speaker 1: You could just steal it and if you have the scepter you have control of the royal you know Reliquary and you can.

718
00:53:42,779 --> 00:53:43,020
Speaker 1: you know.

719
00:53:43,341 --> 00:53:45,330
Speaker 1: you can make people into citizens.

720
00:53:45,491 --> 00:53:56,890
Speaker 1: You can grant them citizenship because you're holding the scepter or you can exile people who are citizens And it's like the Chancellor starts with it, but anyone else can come and fucking imagine take it Chancellor.

721
00:53:57,191 --> 00:54:02,810
Speaker 0: He gives joy joy Shabbat ooh citizenship, and then I steal the scepter and exile Joe Joe Joe Shabbat ooh.

722
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:03,716
Speaker 0: How fun is that right?

723
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:05,629
Speaker 1: It's hard to do, but you can do it.

724
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:07,257
Speaker 1: You know you can all cut.

725
00:54:07,318 --> 00:54:08,765
Speaker 1: all these things are possible like they're.

726
00:54:08,805 --> 00:54:23,550
Speaker 1: nothing in the game is like special in any kind of ways that you interact with all the things in ways that make sense narratively within the context of the actions And I guess really get really creative with your solutions.

727
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:29,470
Speaker 0: Situations I would call out on a high level without getting too deep into the details are that one?

728
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:48,649
Speaker 0: The the economy of the game is interesting in that it is a closed economy like if you do things Favor goes out onto the board and favor only comes back from that same board and some things you do Just destroy favor like you could shrink the actual full economy of the game in the course of the game.

729
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,257
Speaker 0: Another commodity the secrets those books.

730
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:55,290
Speaker 0: They're a resource that you can just use over and over and over again.

731
00:54:55,310 --> 00:55:00,150
Speaker 0: They're like a recharging resource, but you can also burn them to almost supercharge yourself.

732
00:55:00,453 --> 00:55:05,081
Speaker 0: But as I learned if you burn all your books You're not a great position in the mid game right.

733
00:55:05,382 --> 00:55:07,168
Speaker 1: well, you can also just get more books.

734
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:07,590
Speaker 1: right.

735
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:14,724
Speaker 1: There's like a. there's an infinite supply of books But they're very difficult to get so that meanwhile the favors are easier to get but they're.

736
00:55:14,864 --> 00:55:16,569
Speaker 0: they're literally a zero-sum game.

737
00:55:17,293 --> 00:55:28,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, the favors are in this sort of closed economy But not only are there a limited number of them, but based on this suits on the different cards We're not gonna get into that, but yeah, basically there's different piles of favor.

738
00:55:29,332 --> 00:55:32,950
Speaker 1: So maybe there's a huge pile of favor on like the hearth bank.

739
00:55:33,351 --> 00:55:38,390
Speaker 1: So you can doing hearth things like you can go get favors from hearth peoples.

740
00:55:38,973 --> 00:55:41,423
Speaker 1: But maybe the discord bank could be empty.

741
00:55:41,464 --> 00:55:42,890
Speaker 1: maybe someone emptied it on purpose.

742
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:48,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, like you know if you're if you're playing a big discord game you have discord advisors and stuff.

743
00:55:48,894 --> 00:55:50,387
Speaker 1: It's like why you want to get some favor.

744
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:51,192
Speaker 1: It's like well You can't.

745
00:55:51,232 --> 00:55:51,735
Speaker 1: the discord.

746
00:55:51,755 --> 00:55:53,283
Speaker 1: people have no favors to give.

747
00:55:53,323 --> 00:55:54,730
Speaker 1: they've already given all their favors.

748
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:55,814
Speaker 1: You know they don't.

749
00:55:56,135 --> 00:55:58,824
Speaker 1: they're too busy or they're spent right.

750
00:55:58,884 --> 00:56:01,452
Speaker 1: and that's what it's again narratively Representing.

751
00:56:01,794 --> 00:56:01,974
Speaker 1: like.

752
00:56:02,215 --> 00:56:04,282
Speaker 1: yeah, you kept going to ask favors from the old people.

753
00:56:04,322 --> 00:56:05,847
Speaker 1: They don't have any more favors to do.

754
00:56:05,908 --> 00:56:06,570
Speaker 1: give anymore.

755
00:56:09,352 --> 00:56:12,565
Speaker 1: Right people kept giving favors to the to the order.

756
00:56:12,626 --> 00:56:14,413
Speaker 1: you know clan It's like.

757
00:56:14,434 --> 00:56:18,030
Speaker 1: so now you can go and ask the order clan for favors because they're doing great.

758
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:20,040
Speaker 1: They got plenty of time to help you out.

759
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:20,844
Speaker 1: join your army.

760
00:56:20,904 --> 00:56:27,103
Speaker 0: Whatever you want them to do Mmm, so I guess the other interesting mechanic is the way combat works.

761
00:56:27,203 --> 00:56:29,370
Speaker 0: is the dice have a whole thing going on.

762
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:42,180
Speaker 0: But basically if I'm attacking Scott I List out all the things Scott has that I want to attack and it turns into one big pool And I either win it all or I win nothing.

763
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:44,670
Speaker 0: so you can literally go big or go home with this game.

764
00:56:45,273 --> 00:56:48,250
Speaker 0: And that's a really there's a lot of nuance and detail to that.

765
00:56:48,733 --> 00:56:51,670
Speaker 1: You can attack people you can attack their relics.

766
00:56:51,851 --> 00:56:55,087
Speaker 0: I could be like I'm just gonna see the banners that you didn't even talk about.

767
00:56:55,107 --> 00:56:56,311
Speaker 0: the banners Yeah like.

768
00:56:56,391 --> 00:56:58,518
Speaker 0: I might say I'm just gonna take that relic from you.

769
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:04,620
Speaker 0: or I might say I'm gonna knock you out of these four places and I'm stealing your favor, and I'm taking that relic.

770
00:57:04,881 --> 00:57:06,147
Speaker 0: and then you're like well.

771
00:57:06,227 --> 00:57:07,659
Speaker 0: I have a giant army I'm the Chancellor.

772
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:08,448
Speaker 0: what the fuck do you have?

773
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:13,291
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's all kinds of stuff you get really creative with what you're gonna Do.

774
00:57:13,432 --> 00:57:17,990
Speaker 1: yeah, and then basically the attacker you know the defender rolls dice and sets the bar.

775
00:57:18,611 --> 00:57:20,963
Speaker 1: It's like this is how high you have to jump if you want to win.

776
00:57:21,405 --> 00:57:30,987
Speaker 1: then the attacker jumps And if the attacker doesn't meet the bar or exceed it they can kill their own guys To jump higher or just accept the loss.

777
00:57:31,148 --> 00:57:33,435
Speaker 1: yep So that's how the combat works.

778
00:57:33,456 --> 00:57:42,061
Speaker 1: and then yeah like rim said the attacker either wins in which case they take all the things that They were attacking or they lose and they just lose half their dudes.

779
00:57:42,302 --> 00:57:55,350
Speaker 0: Yeah in the attack, so I guess Should you buy it or not is an interesting question because I would say if you're in the Fert play it once Maybe before you buy it just to make sure the mechanics jive with you.

780
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:57,118
Speaker 0: You can play it on TTS.

781
00:57:57,218 --> 00:57:58,464
Speaker 1: You can read the rules online.

782
00:57:58,504 --> 00:57:59,870
Speaker 1: the PDF is just on their website.

783
00:58:00,051 --> 00:58:03,806
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's no official tabletop simulator like scripted version.

784
00:58:03,866 --> 00:58:07,438
Speaker 0: You can just open And play but try it out.

785
00:58:07,558 --> 00:58:10,290
Speaker 1: I don't know how I don't know how you preserve the legacy aspect.

786
00:58:11,192 --> 00:58:12,502
Speaker 1: There might be a way.

787
00:58:12,563 --> 00:58:15,838
Speaker 1: there probably is a way But you're probably just gonna you know.

788
00:58:15,978 --> 00:58:19,510
Speaker 1: use it to test and play the first game with the starting setup.

789
00:58:19,691 --> 00:58:27,754
Speaker 0: Internalize that your first game especially if it's a teaching game will take about twice as long as a game once everyone knows the deal Like literally about 20 as long.

790
00:58:28,216 --> 00:58:30,362
Speaker 1: also accept the fact that you're gonna get.

791
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:32,608
Speaker 1: there's a. there are some fiddly rules.

792
00:58:32,668 --> 00:58:35,377
Speaker 1: the biggest rule We keep getting wrong is the protection.

793
00:58:35,397 --> 00:58:42,178
Speaker 1: This will make no sense to anyone, but you can only Reclaim reclaim this.

794
00:58:42,399 --> 00:58:44,429
Speaker 1: the banner of the darkest secret.

795
00:58:44,449 --> 00:59:01,034
Speaker 1: if The person who has it is at a site Where one of the advisors at the site at least does not match one of the denizens at the site Does not match the suit of any of the person's advisors It's like there has to.

796
00:59:01,054 --> 00:59:05,967
Speaker 1: they have to be in a place where someone lives who is not friendly with them.

797
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:07,693
Speaker 1: right narratively It makes sense.

798
00:59:07,754 --> 00:59:11,050
Speaker 1: it's like yeah, you want to steal the banner of the darkest secret from someone.

799
00:59:11,493 --> 00:59:22,895
Speaker 1: They have to be standing in a place Where there are unfriendly peoples that you can convince to help you steal the banner if they're standing among friends or standing among No one who's there to steal it.

800
00:59:23,396 --> 00:59:28,349
Speaker 1: right, but it's a really hard rule to remember and parse when you read the English of it.

801
00:59:29,792 --> 00:59:34,450
Speaker 0: So when you're teaching this game spend a lot of time on all the proper nouns and defining them.

802
00:59:34,831 --> 00:59:44,130
Speaker 0: It'll save you a lot of grief, but if you if you like it like you feel like you can engage with it I'd also say only buy it if you are confident.

803
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:47,370
Speaker 0: You will get it to the table a bunch of times not necessarily with the same people.

804
00:59:47,912 --> 00:59:53,009
Speaker 0: But this game does not shine unless you play it many times.

805
00:59:53,951 --> 00:59:55,517
Speaker 1: Yep, I mean some people out there.

806
00:59:55,577 --> 00:59:59,090
Speaker 1: I know are like I'm gonna play it only with this one group and that's it.

807
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:00,556
Speaker 0: That's a real fun way to go.

808
01:00:00,577 --> 01:00:02,244
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a fun way to go.

809
01:00:02,506 --> 01:00:07,170
Speaker 1: my I'm like, alright I'm gonna be the one who I'm playing it with whoever is gonna play it, right?

810
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:10,070
Speaker 1: I don't need the same people to be in the same seat all the time.

811
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:11,296
Speaker 0: It's like we met with.

812
01:00:11,437 --> 01:00:16,288
Speaker 0: we met with the person who was the Chancellor in the game before the game We played and we could tell the story like.

813
01:00:16,329 --> 01:00:19,823
Speaker 0: hey Scott the steward of your empire kept it together.

814
01:00:20,145 --> 01:00:21,050
Speaker 0: He's still Chancellor.

815
01:00:22,072 --> 01:00:22,679
Speaker 1: yeah, it's like.

816
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:34,370
Speaker 1: so like because I Narratively right if the red exile wins in game one in game two The Chancellor at the start of game two there might be a different red exile in game two.

817
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:40,366
Speaker 1: But the Chancellor in game one is that same person who was the red exile in the previous game.

818
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:41,229
Speaker 1: because they want right?

819
01:00:41,269 --> 01:00:43,212
Speaker 1: Yeah So you can.

820
01:00:43,293 --> 01:00:44,978
Speaker 1: you can carry it forward that way.

821
01:00:45,038 --> 01:00:51,515
Speaker 1: if you keep playing with the same human beings like you can really be the character But you don't have to right.

822
01:00:51,575 --> 01:00:52,697
Speaker 1: It's like it doesn't matter.

823
01:00:53,138 --> 01:00:53,660
Speaker 1: It works out.

824
01:00:54,421 --> 01:01:01,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, so try it out before you buy it and Really like if you like it commit to it.

825
01:01:02,001 --> 01:01:11,590
Speaker 0: or you probably don't want to buy it because Playing one iteration of this game without interacting with that longer-term like hey, what kind of stories did we create?

826
01:01:12,374 --> 01:01:15,433
Speaker 0: It's fun, but it's not like That.

827
01:01:15,513 --> 01:01:19,550
Speaker 0: much fun without like engaging with all these other long-term mechanics.

828
01:01:20,513 --> 01:01:25,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you just keep playing like the starting setup over and over like you're gonna get real bored.

829
01:01:26,553 --> 01:01:27,096
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not.

830
01:01:27,176 --> 01:01:28,623
Speaker 1: it's not that fancy right.

831
01:01:29,005 --> 01:01:29,306
Speaker 1: at least it.

832
01:01:29,326 --> 01:01:30,130
Speaker 1: you know it is fancy.

833
01:01:30,232 --> 01:01:31,409
Speaker 1: I guess we had a lot of fun with it.

834
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:40,070
Speaker 1: But if you did it over and over again like you're seeing the same cards Yeah, you don't have any like ruins and other edifices that can end up on the board.

835
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:46,076
Speaker 1: There's these other all these other things going on when you play several times More powerful relics coming out.

836
01:01:46,597 --> 01:01:50,166
Speaker 1: You know different sites like we had you know like I said that sunken city.

837
01:01:50,486 --> 01:01:53,194
Speaker 1: Let's Lincoln City was Narratively.
