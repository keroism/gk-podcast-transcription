1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,817
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday January 18th, and this is geek nights.

2
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:19,338
Speaker 1: tonight It's my birthday, and we talk about wings of reen and we have some final thoughts on big O2.

3
00:00:20,707 --> 00:00:21,698
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:22,903 --> 00:00:30,874
Speaker 1: so it's my birthday even though I Completely forgot and the only reason I realized it was my birthday is because people kept telling me all day.

5
00:00:30,894 --> 00:00:36,350
Speaker 0: I also completely forgot and We just seem to not care about birthdays anymore.

6
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:37,755
Speaker 1: Yeah, well.

7
00:00:37,775 --> 00:00:38,920
Speaker 1: I don't even know when your birthday is.

8
00:00:39,021 --> 00:00:40,996
Speaker 1: I only know it's a few months after mine April 30th.

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:41,761
Speaker 0: I think.

10
00:00:41,962 --> 00:00:45,740
Speaker 1: whenever I forget how old I am I just ask you and then I know that I'm at most a year older.

11
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,927
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's kind of weird.

12
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:53,008
Speaker 0: when you're a little kid you're gonna get a bunch of presents, and you don't have money So you don't usually get stuff so often.

13
00:00:53,048 --> 00:00:54,634
Speaker 0: so you're like oh my god.

14
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:55,858
Speaker 0: My birthday's in like 10 days.

15
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:57,245
Speaker 0: Oh my god It's in 9 days.

16
00:00:57,305 --> 00:00:59,215
Speaker 0: You know, but once you're at this age.

17
00:00:59,235 --> 00:01:01,023
Speaker 0: You're just like oh Birthday.

18
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:01,745
Speaker 0: right.

19
00:01:02,207 --> 00:01:10,415
Speaker 1: well, I also realize anything because a bunch of people asked me so rim What do you want for your birthday, and I couldn't honestly think of anything.

20
00:01:10,876 --> 00:01:11,840
Speaker 0: you buy me a computer.

21
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,064
Speaker 0: How about a car?

22
00:01:13,084 --> 00:01:13,987
Speaker 0: I could use.

23
00:01:14,028 --> 00:01:16,597
Speaker 1: those things I mean I really want for nothing.

24
00:01:16,637 --> 00:01:20,154
Speaker 1: the only kinds of things I want are things that I wouldn't expect someone to just buy me.

25
00:01:20,536 --> 00:01:27,051
Speaker 1: so I guess the only gifts I like are just like creative or nice gifts or things I wouldn't think of getting that aren't particularly useful that are just cool.

26
00:01:27,393 --> 00:01:31,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, seriously if you're gonna give me a present It's like it's got to be something nowadays.

27
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,632
Speaker 0: It's got to be something I can't buy because if I can buy it What do I need you to buy it for me?

28
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:37,439
Speaker 1: well for me?

29
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,192
Speaker 1: I just have a big heart a very difficult time buying gifts for other people.

30
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:44,500
Speaker 1: when I like if I feel obligated to Like I'll see a thing.

31
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,180
Speaker 1: I'll give people gifts just randomly when I decide that it's a good gift-giving time.

32
00:01:48,622 --> 00:01:53,503
Speaker 1: But I know I almost never give gifts around Christmas or any other holiday Mmm.

33
00:01:53,523 --> 00:02:00,616
Speaker 0: I just had not to give things because I don't expect things, but if I have a reason to give someone something It's either something like generic like flowers.

34
00:02:00,917 --> 00:02:03,608
Speaker 0: They're nice You know it's in the end.

35
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:03,849
Speaker 0: They'll.

36
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,517
Speaker 0: you know they'll go away, and that'll be that.

37
00:02:05,537 --> 00:02:09,854
Speaker 0: or You know you make something for someone like.

38
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:10,539
Speaker 0: that's what you can do.

39
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:19,179
Speaker 0: That's awesome is you can always make something for someone especially if you have art and/or craft skills because That's not something that anyone could just buy in the store.

40
00:02:19,922 --> 00:02:22,790
Speaker 0: So it's like ah if someone goes and buys something for me.

41
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,096
Speaker 0: It's like oh great if someone makes something.

42
00:02:25,156 --> 00:02:30,230
Speaker 0: It's like oh Especially if it's an awesome thing if you make a crap thing.

43
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,076
Speaker 0: I guess you know whatever.

44
00:02:32,337 --> 00:02:33,040
Speaker 0: I'll just feel bad.

45
00:02:34,244 --> 00:02:38,330
Speaker 1: So in the news today PC game sales I remember way back.

46
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,000
Speaker 1: We had a discussion about whether or not PC gaming was dead.

47
00:02:42,441 --> 00:02:47,159
Speaker 1: Ten million dollars less worth of PC games were sold this year as opposed to last year.

48
00:02:47,822 --> 00:02:50,460
Speaker 0: We're ten million dollars more Xbox game sold.

49
00:02:51,122 --> 00:02:56,076
Speaker 1: I don't know, but I have the list here on game Sutra of what the top ten games in 2005 were.

50
00:02:56,096 --> 00:02:58,984
Speaker 0: and PC games right.

51
00:02:59,084 --> 00:03:00,531
Speaker 1: yeah PC games only all right.

52
00:03:00,672 --> 00:03:10,902
Speaker 1: and the one interesting thing is that Basically one two three four of the top ten are the sims 2 or sims 2 related items Really?

53
00:03:10,922 --> 00:03:20,698
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you add up all the sims 2 that is on this list the sims 2 is far and away the number one PC game in the world for another year.

54
00:03:20,718 --> 00:03:30,181
Speaker 0: now Please repeat to me the minimum system requirements in fact repeat to me the recommended system requirements for playing the sims 2.

55
00:03:30,181 --> 00:03:30,623
Speaker 1: You know what.

56
00:03:30,924 --> 00:03:33,535
Speaker 1: I think it's suffice to say that the sims 2 runs on a computer.

57
00:03:33,575 --> 00:03:36,798
Speaker 0: That's slower than mine And you know what?

58
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,350
Speaker 0: That makes it pretty much Dumb to have a more powerful computer.

59
00:03:42,672 --> 00:03:43,837
Speaker 1: now the list number one.

60
00:03:43,917 --> 00:03:45,647
Speaker 1: if you break them up I'll just read the list.

61
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:47,740
Speaker 1: number one is World of Warcraft duh.

62
00:03:48,481 --> 00:03:51,068
Speaker 1: Number two is the sims 2 some expansion.

63
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:54,777
Speaker 1: the number three game is sims 2 which I think came out in 2004 didn't it?

64
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,171
Speaker 0: I don't know when it came out, but definitely not recently.

65
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,840
Speaker 1: Guild Wars is number four.

66
00:04:00,222 --> 00:04:03,340
Speaker 0: Oh really that the game we had like that was the one with no monthly fee, right?

67
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,242
Speaker 1: I think so.

68
00:04:04,282 --> 00:04:07,700
Speaker 1: there are a few real games on the list in addition to these fluff games.

69
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:08,241
Speaker 0: Yeah It was.

70
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:13,584
Speaker 0: that was the MMO that was supposed to have no monthly fee because you would pay 50 bucks and get it in the Store and that would be that.

71
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:16,920
Speaker 0: and it was supposed to be different like no evil grinding and whatever.

72
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:19,176
Speaker 0: But it turned out to just be crap like every other MMO.

73
00:04:19,276 --> 00:04:22,675
Speaker 1: Yep Number five is roller coaster tycoon 3, you know?

74
00:04:24,286 --> 00:04:31,160
Speaker 0: You look at those games and you say oh There's just another one of those generic tycoon games because it's probably the most evolved form of that type of game right now.

75
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:39,520
Speaker 0: Yeah I actually played the original original roller coaster tycoon before any of the other Tycoons existed and it was actually kind of fun for a while.

76
00:04:40,623 --> 00:04:40,925
Speaker 0: It's like it's.

77
00:04:40,985 --> 00:04:46,798
Speaker 0: it's like Sim City 2000 only with a different theme on it Yeah, and you get to design the little roller coasters, which can be fun.

78
00:04:47,823 --> 00:04:50,775
Speaker 1: Number six was battlefield 2 which I here is actually a pretty good game.

79
00:04:50,996 --> 00:04:54,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, I heard it was All right, number seven The Sims 2 another expansion.

80
00:04:55,783 --> 00:05:00,157
Speaker 0: number eight Age of Empires 3 All right, and ever actually played those.

81
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:06,613
Speaker 1: Yeah I've heard that they're kind of a lot of people try to compare them to civilization games And they're just a completely different kind of game.

82
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:06,976
Speaker 1: Really.

83
00:05:06,996 --> 00:05:11,480
Speaker 1: Hmm I've never known anyone who actually liked them or at least if they have they never said anything.

84
00:05:11,863 --> 00:05:21,533
Speaker 0: Yeah, I never actually played one so I can't say Number nine is another Sims thing and number ten is Call of Duty 2 One of those generic World War games.

85
00:05:21,996 --> 00:05:37,080
Speaker 0: Yeah So what it all comes down to is that as I said and people may or may not have believed me PC gaming in terms of gamers gaming on PCs with FPS's and I mean, it's not dead.

86
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:45,966
Speaker 1: Yes, there are people who play PC games and PC games are big business still but there's no market for PC games that require fast computers.

87
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:46,670
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

88
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:52,356
Speaker 1: I Mean, no, I hate to say it but notice how Half-Life 2 and its derivatives aren't even on that list.

89
00:05:52,858 --> 00:05:57,674
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Well, I have like two came out last year, but the Sims came out two years, right?

90
00:05:57,795 --> 00:05:58,859
Speaker 0: So, come on.

91
00:05:59,322 --> 00:06:01,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, Doom 3 doesn't appear Quake 4 doesn't appear.

92
00:06:02,822 --> 00:06:04,372
Speaker 1: Well, I can see why Doom 3 doesn't appear.

93
00:06:04,392 --> 00:06:05,500
Speaker 1: that game was pretty piss poor.

94
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:19,043
Speaker 0: Well, Quake 4 was also sort of generic, but those other games that people were hyping up the the fear game didn't appear That even that one what was it called the Indigo prophecy?

95
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:19,746
Speaker 0: that didn't appear.

96
00:06:19,766 --> 00:06:22,133
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah people talk that one up big time.

97
00:06:22,374 --> 00:06:22,796
Speaker 0: Where is it?

98
00:06:23,357 --> 00:06:23,899
Speaker 0: No one bought it.

99
00:06:24,563 --> 00:06:25,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean part of it's that.

100
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,980
Speaker 1: I mean because I saw another report.

101
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:41,259
Speaker 1: We don't get into the news on this but PC sales are down significantly, too Because honestly other than hardcore gamers and people like us Very few people need new computers anymore and they've realized this and they stopped buying them.

102
00:06:42,063 --> 00:06:49,020
Speaker 0: it's starting to get to the point where the only people buying new computers are dumb people who Have it spy wear it up and they don't know better.

103
00:06:49,271 --> 00:06:58,338
Speaker 0: Yeah And people who are so poor that they couldn't afford one before and now they're getting so cheap They can finally get one or gamers who really know what they need and get it.

104
00:06:59,782 --> 00:07:05,439
Speaker 0: But that's not too much because there aren't PC games coming out and selling big that they need to upgrade for.

105
00:07:06,001 --> 00:07:11,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, so which is also bringing hardware costs down to where fast PCs are getting cheaper daily.

106
00:07:11,842 --> 00:07:19,286
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm gonna build a new PC probably this weekend partly because I was looking around online and I was just thinking all right.

107
00:07:19,346 --> 00:07:21,700
Speaker 1: I want to build a three or four hundred dollar computer because that's all I need.

108
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,429
Speaker 1: I don't play the new game so much and that'll play those new games.

109
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:32,499
Speaker 1: Just fine anyway, and I wanted a little micro ATX motherboard, but I saw that they all kind of suck compared to large full-size motherboards.

110
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:36,692
Speaker 1: and Then I stumbled upon a motherboard that I looked awesome.

111
00:07:36,732 --> 00:07:38,479
Speaker 1: It was perfect in every way and it was really cheap.

112
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:41,572
Speaker 1: and I thought it was a normal motherboard ATX.

113
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:45,088
Speaker 1: and I'm deciding alright I'm gonna buy this motherboard because it does everything I need.

114
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:55,676
Speaker 1: then I look and I find out that not only is it Micro ATX which I didn't notice yet It still has four dims and two s ATAs and two ID or s ATAs.

115
00:07:55,957 --> 00:07:58,868
Speaker 1: for s ATAs Yep, it has everything.

116
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:00,456
Speaker 1: it does everything I would possibly need.

117
00:08:00,496 --> 00:08:01,320
Speaker 1: it's micro ATX.

118
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,352
Speaker 1: it has raid 5 built into it.

119
00:08:04,552 --> 00:08:15,760
Speaker 0: on the s ATA there's a raid 5 and The North Bridge has a geforce 6100 built into it with a DVI and a VGA connector on the motherboard and you can use them both simultaneously.

120
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,043
Speaker 1: It's dual head.

121
00:08:17,484 --> 00:08:20,835
Speaker 1: Yeah, and not only that that video card supports DirectX 9.

122
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:24,099
Speaker 1: It's Basically a top-of-the-line video card.

123
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:29,640
Speaker 0: So the only thing really wrong with this motherboard is that you need extra RAM because the video card doesn't have its own RAM.

124
00:08:29,861 --> 00:08:31,388
Speaker 0: So you need to give it normal RAM.

125
00:08:31,489 --> 00:08:34,881
Speaker 1: However, it takes standard DDR and Jeep.

126
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:36,327
Speaker 1: Yep, DDR PC 3200.

127
00:08:36,327 --> 00:08:39,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what I have in my computer and that RAM is fairly dirt-cheap.

128
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,527
Speaker 1: I'm probably gonna get a couple gigs of RAM at least.

129
00:08:41,648 --> 00:08:44,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would recommend two gigs because the video card doesn't have any.

130
00:08:44,954 --> 00:08:57,266
Speaker 1: Yeah well also because I do you know the podcast and RAM directly Translates to the podcast sounding better because I can do more to it Yep, and you just throw a nice powerful 64-bit AMD processor in there and You're good to go.

131
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:57,949
Speaker 0: the sound card.

132
00:08:57,969 --> 00:09:00,240
Speaker 0: that's on the motherboards a little crappy, but that can be replaced.

133
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,644
Speaker 1: It's socket what?

134
00:09:01,644 --> 00:09:02,327
Speaker 1: 939?

135
00:09:02,327 --> 00:09:08,286
Speaker 1: so it takes the Athlon FX 64. the Athlon 6 can't afford the FX No and it also takes the sempron.

136
00:09:08,306 --> 00:09:14,751
Speaker 1: so I could put a sempron in there now and then a year from now when an FX is Cheap just buy them top the fastest FX there is and stick it in.

137
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,296
Speaker 0: I would just get a normal AMD 64.

138
00:09:16,296 --> 00:09:23,386
Speaker 1: actually I'm probably gonna go with 64 since I'm gonna do Linux and if I install Windows on it I'll get that 64-bit version of Windows.

139
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:24,952
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the.

140
00:09:24,972 --> 00:09:26,980
Speaker 0: that's the sure bet to make sure everything's all good.

141
00:09:27,386 --> 00:09:30,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, though if I'm cheap I could just throw at the top of the line sempron in there.

142
00:09:30,761 --> 00:09:32,640
Speaker 0: The thing is I've heard some with the semprons.

143
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:37,060
Speaker 0: There's some weird things where some of them are some way and some of them are another way and it gets weird.

144
00:09:37,504 --> 00:09:38,979
Speaker 0: You need to be real careful buying those.

145
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,967
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually suck is there's different with semprons.

146
00:09:40,967 --> 00:09:44,380
Speaker 0: 64 is the normal semprons or something else, but you can't put that in there.

147
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:48,280
Speaker 1: Well, you know what I'll probably over the next couple weeks be building my computer.

148
00:09:48,501 --> 00:09:54,076
Speaker 1: So I'll have regular updates to all of you who may also be in the market for computers as to exactly what I'm getting And why?

149
00:09:55,382 --> 00:09:57,560
Speaker 0: The one thing though is right now you have a full tower case.

150
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,794
Speaker 0: You're gonna be switching to those little tiny cases like the one that my parents have.

151
00:10:00,874 --> 00:10:06,170
Speaker 0: Oh, it's gonna be so fantastic it's gonna be so tiny and You're not gonna be able to put a bunch of stuff in there.

152
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,000
Speaker 0: It only has room for one hard drive and one.

153
00:10:09,861 --> 00:10:11,406
Speaker 1: Well, it depends on what kind of case I get.

154
00:10:11,867 --> 00:10:20,053
Speaker 0: yeah, but you know other cases can hold micro ATX boards But really you can get a normal ATX board.

155
00:10:20,093 --> 00:10:25,079
Speaker 0: that probably is the same exact thing With a good better sound card in it.

156
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:33,667
Speaker 1: Well, actually I was looking and I saw a two micro ATX cases that they both have space for four hard drives within them Really and they have.

157
00:10:33,728 --> 00:10:36,140
Speaker 1: I'll dig up the link another time, but I saw it at work.

158
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:38,047
Speaker 0: Okay, because usually I figured the there.

159
00:10:38,067 --> 00:10:41,419
Speaker 1: well, they're a little bigger than the ones we typically see but there's still micro ATX.

160
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:49,896
Speaker 1: They're still tiny and they have the USB and the firewire and the fronds and that it has one External five and a quarter bay which is all I need because a DVD burner is gonna go there.

161
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:52,446
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's it And it looks perfect.

162
00:10:52,647 --> 00:10:57,429
Speaker 1: It's a kind of expensive, but it's got the mad quiet cooling Which is what I want more than anything.

163
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:58,535
Speaker 0: Yeah, the big giant fans.

164
00:10:58,978 --> 00:11:05,623
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, plus my micro ATX is a lot easier to cool and clean just because it's really little and the airflow is usually really simple Mm-hmm.

165
00:11:06,548 --> 00:11:13,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just that all the micro ATX cases I've seen that look really nice are usually really small and cramped and don't have a lot of room to put drives.

166
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,883
Speaker 0: but that's kind of.

167
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:24,119
Speaker 0: the point is that you get you're only getting a small motherboard because you want this small tiny cute case and You know that you're not gonna put a lot of stuff in it because you want a tiny cute case.

168
00:11:25,162 --> 00:11:27,395
Speaker 0: But if you found one that fits that's pretty cool.

169
00:11:27,757 --> 00:11:34,199
Speaker 1: Yep, of course I'm still doing my research because the last time I bought a computer I did three months of research before I finally bought one.

170
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:42,779
Speaker 1: hmm, but of course now I know a lot more about computers because the last time I did this was in the year 2000 and I don't think it'll take me three months this time.

171
00:11:43,442 --> 00:11:47,320
Speaker 1: I don't think so either but it's gonna be a big weekend if I get a computer and Scott gets a car.

172
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:50,554
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe I will get the car this weekend or next week.

173
00:11:50,574 --> 00:11:50,855
Speaker 0: Who knows?

174
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:51,700
Speaker 0: I'll have to call those people.

175
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:55,255
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz I was at work and there's a race car guy in my office.

176
00:11:55,315 --> 00:12:01,675
Speaker 1: He races cars He knows a lot about cars and I mentioned Hey, the Mazda 3 is really the only good car in that class.

177
00:12:01,715 --> 00:12:06,377
Speaker 1: and he said yeah The Mazda 3 is by far the best car in that price range you can ever buy.

178
00:12:06,397 --> 00:12:09,784
Speaker 0: great I just need more reasons to go and get this I know he said.

179
00:12:09,844 --> 00:12:10,407
Speaker 1: and then someone.

180
00:12:10,427 --> 00:12:12,818
Speaker 1: he said like the six is just as good if you want us it in.

181
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:15,404
Speaker 0: Yeah, I drove the six.

182
00:12:15,464 --> 00:12:17,751
Speaker 0: It was a drove like my dad's car.

183
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:18,272
Speaker 0: So I don't want it.

184
00:12:18,573 --> 00:12:19,637
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was very sedan e.

185
00:12:20,038 --> 00:12:21,495
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm sedan e.

186
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:24,086
Speaker 1: So we got some more news, right?

187
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:36,440
Speaker 0: All right, so everyone it might have noticed today There's a big hubbub about this Firefox pinging privacy You know hole in the new version or whatever.

188
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:43,226
Speaker 1: Yeah I didn't read much about it because I saw the alarmism and I decided I was just gonna wait and wait for someone who knows better To just tell me about it.

189
00:12:43,669 --> 00:12:45,639
Speaker 0: Well, here's exactly what's going on here.

190
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:51,159
Speaker 0: There are people who have websites and they want to track when people click on links.

191
00:12:52,141 --> 00:13:11,080
Speaker 0: so what I would they do right now is I would put a link on my website and I would set that link up in such a way with JavaScript or with a redirect or both so that when you click on it, it Actually takes you to a page besides the one that it links says it links to.

192
00:13:11,581 --> 00:13:19,600
Speaker 0: so let's say I had a website and I had a link on my website that said old archives and I wanted to know how Many people were clicking on the archives, right?

193
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:29,300
Speaker 0: I would set it up so that when you clicked on archives It took you somewhere else and then to the archives or loaded another page and then loaded the archives and that other page.

194
00:13:29,822 --> 00:13:31,006
Speaker 0: There's a whole bunch of stuff.

195
00:13:31,066 --> 00:13:32,631
Speaker 0: So I know who you are and I can see.

196
00:13:32,952 --> 00:13:35,080
Speaker 0: oh look how many people visited this page.

197
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,873
Speaker 0: People with it is I can see.

198
00:13:36,893 --> 00:13:36,953
Speaker 0: aha.

199
00:13:38,282 --> 00:13:43,199
Speaker 0: So I know that everyone who visited that page clicked on a link on my site that goes to the archives.

200
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,280
Speaker 1: now That might sound kind of hackish to you and it is kind of hackish and it's prone to problems.

201
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,506
Speaker 1: You can install your server down.

202
00:13:49,546 --> 00:13:50,772
Speaker 1: the redirects might not work.

203
00:13:51,113 --> 00:13:52,600
Speaker 1: people disable things like JavaScript.

204
00:13:53,681 --> 00:14:04,152
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that's not really the best thing especially because it low it slows down page loading times because now you have to load this other page and then load the page you actually want to go to.

205
00:14:04,934 --> 00:14:09,837
Speaker 0: so they've added in Firefox when you to a link you can put a ping.

206
00:14:11,123 --> 00:14:22,003
Speaker 0: What this does is when you visit whenever anyone clicks on that link Firefox will send a ping to the URL in the ping Attribute.

207
00:14:22,826 --> 00:14:26,960
Speaker 0: so it takes this whole entire page out of the critical path.

208
00:14:27,061 --> 00:14:30,519
Speaker 0: So you don't actually have to load another page You just go where you're going like nothing happened.

209
00:14:31,383 --> 00:14:45,140
Speaker 0: And then this ping takes place with XML RPC or something that you don't even know or care about So that people running websites can still track people, you know clicking on links without you know making web browsing a shitter experience.

210
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:53,987
Speaker 1: now a lot of people are saying that this might be a privacy violation or it's just another way to track people and It's really not that big a deal.

211
00:14:54,751 --> 00:14:56,380
Speaker 0: I mean people can do this already.

212
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:06,098
Speaker 0: So you're not really, you know, you're making a little bit easier for them to do it Because now they don't have to hack together something with you know redirect or whatever.

213
00:15:07,322 --> 00:15:09,754
Speaker 0: But there's a hole in IE that can't be closed.

214
00:15:09,794 --> 00:15:10,919
Speaker 0: that lets people do this.

215
00:15:11,471 --> 00:15:25,100
Speaker 0: You know It just works and people do it all the time and there's not much you can do about people Tracking you visiting, you know, if you access someone's web server They're going to log it and they can get information out of you that is sent to them by your browser.

216
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:28,680
Speaker 0: Well, I mean browser isn't sending any more information now than it's sending already.

217
00:15:29,003 --> 00:15:30,900
Speaker 1: We know a lot about the people looking at geek nights.

218
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,793
Speaker 1: We can see a lot of times what kind of web browsers people use in.

219
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,880
Speaker 1: I can look at the feed and see exactly what?

220
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,636
Speaker 1: RSS readers you're using out there.

221
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:41,460
Speaker 1: If I wanted I could track you down specifically.

222
00:15:41,801 --> 00:15:47,777
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is is you can feel free to disable all those things and there's actually ways to do that.

223
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:56,476
Speaker 0: you can disable Referrals and you can disable Your user agent strings and you can change all these things so that people can't track you.

224
00:15:56,957 --> 00:16:00,050
Speaker 0: when you visit websites You can go through proxies and hide your IP address.

225
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,958
Speaker 0: You can hide everything if you go through the effort.

226
00:16:03,074 --> 00:16:09,579
Speaker 0: but There's a point at which with disabling things Makes the web a shittier experience for you.

227
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,680
Speaker 0: So and actually giving away that information doesn't really harm harm you.

228
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:19,880
Speaker 0: I mean someone detecting that using Firefox isn't really an invasion of privacy.

229
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,764
Speaker 1: In fact, it might be.

230
00:16:20,784 --> 00:16:25,525
Speaker 1: you could consider it a good thing because then they might be more inclined to care if Firefox works on Their site properly.

231
00:16:25,948 --> 00:16:27,257
Speaker 0: Yeah, so this is just one.

232
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:30,268
Speaker 0: It's just a way to make something easier.

233
00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:32,917
Speaker 0: that is currently kind of making the web shittier.

234
00:16:33,438 --> 00:16:38,480
Speaker 1: now, of course I mean this is new and obviously we're gonna see how people use and abuse it in the coming months.

235
00:16:39,304 --> 00:16:42,399
Speaker 1: So just stay tuned and I don't think anything big is going to come of it.

236
00:16:42,781 --> 00:16:46,540
Speaker 0: The one thing I think is that actually it won't solve the problem.

237
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,999
Speaker 0: It's trying to solve because people will use it in places instead of their redirects and things.

238
00:16:52,763 --> 00:17:00,795
Speaker 0: But only people with Firefox are currently supporting this change So they're still going to use the shitty redirects for to track the IE people and others.

239
00:17:01,076 --> 00:17:04,469
Speaker 0: So until IE7 comes out or whatever.

240
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:10,545
Speaker 0: This isn't going to solve the problem They're trying to solve but at the same time Webmasters who are savvy.

241
00:17:11,006 --> 00:17:21,060
Speaker 1: this will make it a lot easier for them to notice how many Firefox users they actually have Because it's possible that there are a lot more Firefox users out there than the statistics say.

242
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:31,026
Speaker 0: I also see people making cool things happen by having using the pinging feature Somehow incorporating web services and links and things so that could be a bonus.

243
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:32,528
Speaker 0: someone will do something with that.

244
00:17:40,199 --> 00:17:42,760
Speaker 0: I'm not the biggest Toy freak, you know.

245
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:53,120
Speaker 0: there are those people who will buy every single toy and they'll go to Toys R Us to get Toys R Us exclusive toys and Walmart to get Walmart exclusive toys and whatnot and they won't open the packages.

246
00:17:53,180 --> 00:18:05,964
Speaker 0: They'll just like hang them on their wall and they'll organize like their entire rooms With toys along the walls and poses and organized by what series they're from and what you know universe They're from and whatnot.

247
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:07,550
Speaker 1: See to me those people have issues.

248
00:18:08,906 --> 00:18:17,805
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're just crazy collectors But I do like the occasional toy especially when it's extra cool or has some special meaning or something especially if it's fun to play with.

249
00:18:18,106 --> 00:18:20,957
Speaker 0: if it's fun to play with that's like the hugest bonus the toy can have.

250
00:18:20,977 --> 00:18:30,834
Speaker 0: so Today I saw a toy series that combines two really awesome things Star Wars and transformers.

251
00:18:32,107 --> 00:18:34,667
Speaker 0: Yeah So they've got the first toy.

252
00:18:34,827 --> 00:18:35,691
Speaker 0: There are four toys.

253
00:18:35,751 --> 00:18:36,835
Speaker 0: I've only seen three of them.

254
00:18:37,096 --> 00:18:43,379
Speaker 0: The first one is You know those little Jedi fighters from episodes one, two, three.

255
00:18:44,264 --> 00:18:46,640
Speaker 0: They're kind of pointy in the little time millennium Falcons.

256
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:49,914
Speaker 0: There's one of those that transforms into obi-wan.

257
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:50,940
Speaker 1: This one's kind of stupid.

258
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,495
Speaker 1: It doesn't transform into obi-wan it transforms into some fat Jedi guy with a lightsaber.

259
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:56,157
Speaker 0: That's pretty much.

260
00:18:56,198 --> 00:18:56,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's right.

261
00:18:57,685 --> 00:19:05,936
Speaker 0: There's one That is general Grievous Which is a really good toy to begin with and then it transforms to that big circle thing.

262
00:19:05,997 --> 00:19:12,118
Speaker 0: remember in Episode two and Grievous was in that circle thing and he rolled around a bit.

263
00:19:13,442 --> 00:19:14,627
Speaker 0: So that's that's an okay toy.

264
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:17,299
Speaker 0: It's actually supposedly the highest quality toy in the series.

265
00:19:18,302 --> 00:19:30,220
Speaker 0: The one the third toy which I saw is the one which said, okay I have to buy this even though it looks like a piece of crap, but I don't care It's a Thai fighter advanced that transforms into Darth Vader.

266
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:35,635
Speaker 0: Wow, the lightsaber becomes little red lasers that the Thai fighter shoots.

267
00:19:35,996 --> 00:19:37,080
Speaker 1: It's pretty badass looking.

268
00:19:37,424 --> 00:19:38,799
Speaker 1: I'm kind of impressed with this toy.

269
00:19:39,581 --> 00:19:44,120
Speaker 0: No, it looks like a piece of shit as far as toys go but not when it's in the time and state.

270
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,024
Speaker 1: It looks really cool.

271
00:19:45,305 --> 00:19:48,420
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but I mean in terms like the quality of the toy.

272
00:19:48,744 --> 00:19:55,239
Speaker 0: It's just some crap toy But it's so cool in what it is that it's a Thai fighter that turns to Darth Vader.

273
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,680
Speaker 1: now They don't say what the fourth toy is though?

274
00:19:58,161 --> 00:19:58,903
Speaker 0: That's because they didn't.

275
00:19:59,184 --> 00:20:04,520
Speaker 0: the people who reported this went to Target and just saw the toys and they didn't see a fourth toy.

276
00:20:04,881 --> 00:20:06,129
Speaker 0: Oh, but I know there was one.

277
00:20:06,229 --> 00:20:09,083
Speaker 1: I'll bet it's a Yoda that turns into a yo-yo That would be cool.

278
00:20:09,344 --> 00:20:12,453
Speaker 0: or a Superball or a Luke that turns into an x-wing something.

279
00:20:13,136 --> 00:20:14,520
Speaker 1: a Luke that turns into his father.

280
00:20:14,801 --> 00:20:15,223
Speaker 0: It'd be nice.

281
00:20:15,263 --> 00:20:19,160
Speaker 0: It was like an emperor an emperor that turned into like an electricity.

282
00:20:20,621 --> 00:20:26,425
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can't think of it what it could be but just make him turn into a frickin Death Star, dude That's pretty good.

283
00:20:27,152 --> 00:20:27,696
Speaker 0: I'll go for that.

284
00:20:28,903 --> 00:20:42,340
Speaker 1: so, uh, I have the 1990 Nintendo World catalog and We remembered by when looking at this that back in the 90s Nintendo released more merchandise in this country than you would ever believe.

285
00:20:43,401 --> 00:20:44,504
Speaker 0: I want it this.

286
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:49,740
Speaker 1: this catalog shows entire rooms furnished in nothing but Nintendo brand merchandise.

287
00:20:50,384 --> 00:20:58,412
Speaker 1: We're talking Nintendo like bean bags Nintendo bedsheets Nintendo husbands things you sit on not husbands.

288
00:20:58,814 --> 00:21:04,499
Speaker 1: Nintendo furniture Nintendo clothing Nintendo clothing that if you wore today, you'd be the coolest kid ever.

289
00:21:05,902 --> 00:21:07,350
Speaker 0: Of course, no one still has this clothing.

290
00:21:08,074 --> 00:21:09,099
Speaker 1: I might have some of it.

291
00:21:09,614 --> 00:21:15,000
Speaker 1: I mean I remember I had because two of the things were these odd knit hats and I remember having a Legend of Zelda and a Mario.

292
00:21:16,201 --> 00:21:22,780
Speaker 0: The closest ever got to owning any of this stuff other than of course the games and such was a Nintendo Mario alarm clock.

293
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,340
Speaker 0: You know the old style with a little hammer that bang book back and forth between two bells.

294
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:29,232
Speaker 1: I had a Care Bears, uh alarm clock just like that.

295
00:21:29,332 --> 00:21:31,240
Speaker 0: My mom ordered it from the JC penny catalog.

296
00:21:31,361 --> 00:21:34,860
Speaker 0: We went to the JC penny desk to pick it up and it was broken.

297
00:21:35,323 --> 00:21:36,972
Speaker 0: So she gave it back and then we went.

298
00:21:36,992 --> 00:21:38,400
Speaker 0: we got another one for the same place.

299
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,163
Speaker 0: It was also broken.

300
00:21:39,726 --> 00:21:41,856
Speaker 0: So I never got that clock and I got a normal clock instead.

301
00:21:42,237 --> 00:21:46,579
Speaker 1: Ah Actually scary how many things in that catalog I remember owning.

302
00:21:47,465 --> 00:21:53,220
Speaker 0: It's scary that in the catalog I want almost everything that's in there and they no longer sell it.

303
00:21:53,421 --> 00:22:02,474
Speaker 0: There was so little Nintendo merchandise official merchandise available in this country today Compared to there was before and compared to Japan today in Japan.

304
00:22:02,534 --> 00:22:08,184
Speaker 0: You can get all this stuff and more But you can't get you know Anything in this country.

305
00:22:08,546 --> 00:22:12,059
Speaker 0: you can get a few t-shirts a few pins and that's about it.

306
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:21,799
Speaker 0: You can't get Mario shoes anymore Can't get Mario hats so easily anymore kind Mario racing suits Mario footies.

307
00:22:22,804 --> 00:22:28,709
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know a Nintendo brand TV stand Beat that.

308
00:22:31,122 --> 00:22:37,800
Speaker 1: So anyway today is anime day and we've got some final thoughts on Big O - since we've seen it all.

309
00:22:38,201 --> 00:22:43,808
Speaker 1: But first we watched episode 1 of wings of Reen And we did.

310
00:22:44,331 --> 00:22:45,679
Speaker 1: we got some things to say about it.

311
00:22:45,941 --> 00:22:49,238
Speaker 0: Well, we didn't know anything about the show and we started watching it other than the name.

312
00:22:49,258 --> 00:22:50,904
Speaker 1: now it starts out really cool.

313
00:22:51,286 --> 00:23:13,773
Speaker 1: it shows like Japan modern Japan normal mundane Japan and there are all these kids and it looks like they're engaged in some sort of like governmental military coup against the American Not occupiers, but the American Defense Forces in Japan And it looks like it's gonna be some sort of political cool thing.

314
00:23:14,094 --> 00:23:20,180
Speaker 0: It seems like they want to You know have a real Japanese military and like they don't want to be drafted.

315
00:23:20,361 --> 00:23:28,280
Speaker 1: I couldn't even tell but they were rebelling and they were cool kids and seriously rebelling like they got a hold of an RPG and Actually fired it at some US troops that were chasing them.

316
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,473
Speaker 0: Yeah, they were driving this Humvee around and they shot the rocket.

317
00:23:31,654 --> 00:23:33,140
Speaker 1: now all that all this is going on.

318
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:44,853
Speaker 1: there's one moment where like a little we like feather appears and goes whoosh on the screen and It went by in a second and up until this point there had been no magic in the show and the feather disappeared right away And we weren't sure what it was.

319
00:23:46,342 --> 00:24:00,554
Speaker 1: Not a few minutes later giant giant magical battleships fly up from under the ocean and they're from a mystical land far away and then there's a girl who has wings that come out of her feet and the show gets fucked up and

320
00:24:01,682 --> 00:24:03,993
Speaker 0: Then it's really really hard to understand what's going on.

321
00:24:04,033 --> 00:24:04,254
Speaker 0: like.

322
00:24:04,837 --> 00:24:12,179
Speaker 0: for a while I thought that the battle that was like one battleship and I thought it was just coming to fight the earth or it would just Got lost or something.

323
00:24:12,681 --> 00:24:18,458
Speaker 0: But then I finally realized that there were actually two sets of battleships that appeared and they were fighting each other.

324
00:24:18,619 --> 00:24:21,996
Speaker 0: and it the fact That it took me so long to realize that that it wasn't it.

325
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:28,080
Speaker 1: Oh They introduced a million characters right away and you have no idea who they are or what they're doing or what's going on.

326
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,820
Speaker 0: You don't even know their names and they don't develop them or tell you anything about them.

327
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:38,709
Speaker 0: It just you just see characters doing stuff and you see the same characters over and over again doing stuff but you don't know about them or why they're doing anything.

328
00:24:38,789 --> 00:24:39,973
Speaker 1: and now too much credit.

329
00:24:40,094 --> 00:24:40,375
Speaker 0: action.

330
00:24:40,555 --> 00:24:50,993
Speaker 1: the main character is gets on one of these battleships, so they think he's the main character almost right away by accident and The first thing he does is find someone and ask them what the hell's going on.

331
00:24:51,535 --> 00:24:53,040
Speaker 1: And he's very like what the hell?

332
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,522
Speaker 1: What is this?

333
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:54,225
Speaker 1: What's going on?

334
00:24:54,647 --> 00:24:57,180
Speaker 1: But everyone ignores him for several minutes.

335
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:00,260
Speaker 1: We thought that in fact, they couldn't see him and that this was some sort of plot device.

336
00:25:01,101 --> 00:25:05,060
Speaker 1: But no, they were just ignoring him and then they talked to him later and they still don't explain anything.

337
00:25:06,222 --> 00:25:08,382
Speaker 0: That's terrific like.

338
00:25:08,884 --> 00:25:16,371
Speaker 1: I don't know if the show is gonna go anywhere, but it introduced a Season's worth of plot in one episode as far as I can tell.

339
00:25:16,753 --> 00:25:28,334
Speaker 0: as far as I can tell there was no plot and it Was just a bunch of action scenes evolved involving some battleships that appear from under the ocean Combined with US military equipment of modern times.

340
00:25:28,495 --> 00:25:29,378
Speaker 0: and then that was it like

341
00:25:29,398 --> 00:25:44,164
Speaker 1: they keep Introducing things like the battleships are here and they start to fight but then there's these dragon golem things on them and then they have these special engines that do something weird and It's just getting more and more out of control and then there's a big explosion and like a nuke and an engine falls out And it's crazy.

342
00:25:44,506 --> 00:25:54,928
Speaker 1: and then a spoiler for the next five seconds and then at the end of the show like there's a big explosion and everyone's dying and then the main character is like, ah And then it was like.

343
00:25:54,948 --> 00:25:57,499
Speaker 1: he says like it's all a dream and then the episode ends.

344
00:25:58,861 --> 00:26:01,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, we don't know if it was actually a dream or what?

345
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,107
Speaker 0: The thing was is I just realized.

346
00:26:04,167 --> 00:26:07,499
Speaker 0: now I went to the anime news network encyclopedia and looked it up.

347
00:26:08,302 --> 00:26:15,673
Speaker 0: This is actually spin-off from or a battler Dunbine, which is an anime I had heard of but never actually have seen.

348
00:26:15,693 --> 00:26:17,943
Speaker 0: it doesn't sound that good I don't know.

349
00:26:18,024 --> 00:26:23,863
Speaker 0: but the point is is that you remember in the show they were talking about like or Engines or something like that.

350
00:26:23,963 --> 00:26:28,135
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I think that's that it actually is a spin-off of some kind.

351
00:26:28,155 --> 00:26:29,660
Speaker 0: I'm just right.

352
00:26:30,142 --> 00:26:37,320
Speaker 0: I don't know if you have to read the manga to understand this or watch By this show makes no sense on its own whatsoever.

353
00:26:38,001 --> 00:26:41,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, so maybe if you watch enough episodes, you know what's going on?

354
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:48,099
Speaker 0: But I'm pretty sure you have to like read either manga or watch some other anime to understand what the hell this is.

355
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:55,220
Speaker 1: So moving on to better anime that we've actually seen all of big o2, which we've talked about twice before we're done with it.

356
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,326
Speaker 1: we've seen the end and There's actually a lot there.

357
00:26:59,406 --> 00:27:00,489
Speaker 1: the show went in directions.

358
00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:01,673
Speaker 1: I didn't expect at all.

359
00:27:01,693 --> 00:27:03,740
Speaker 0: Well, I expected the direction it went.

360
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,154
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, but I didn't expect the magnitude of the direction it went in.

361
00:27:07,174 --> 00:27:08,823
Speaker 0: I Don't know.

362
00:27:08,864 --> 00:27:09,837
Speaker 0: it seemed about right to me.

363
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:19,432
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess the warning I have for anyone who's thinking about watching the show is that it Literally and I know I mean literally in a literal sense pulls an Evangelion.

364
00:27:20,114 --> 00:27:20,976
Speaker 0: Oh, yes very much.

365
00:27:21,016 --> 00:27:27,335
Speaker 0: So the ending is a Very as many many parallels or the ending of the Evangelion TV as in.

366
00:27:27,516 --> 00:27:37,475
Speaker 1: there's action going on And then the show kind of pans back and does the same thing of hey I use big robots to trick you into watching my show now.

367
00:27:37,575 --> 00:27:38,719
Speaker 1: Here's the moral.

368
00:27:39,662 --> 00:27:41,597
Speaker 1: Moral, yeah, and then fade out the end.

369
00:27:42,181 --> 00:27:49,250
Speaker 0: See now the thing is is that I had seen this show maybe four or five years ago I probably would have had a much better opinion of it.

370
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:59,320
Speaker 0: It's just that I've seen so many shows that like The they you know, they put the moral as the ending instead of after the ending.

371
00:28:00,122 --> 00:28:10,483
Speaker 0: You know and they just all of a sudden turn into this huge like blatantly meta in-your-face metaphorical type of thing That it just.

372
00:28:10,584 --> 00:28:11,447
Speaker 0: it doesn't you know.

373
00:28:11,488 --> 00:28:15,042
Speaker 0: do it for me as much as it used to especially when I it's pretty much like I Seen it all.

374
00:28:15,103 --> 00:28:17,633
Speaker 0: so if you do the same thing again, it doesn't doesn't work.

375
00:28:17,653 --> 00:28:18,637
Speaker 1: Well, at least the thing is.

376
00:28:18,717 --> 00:28:24,453
Speaker 1: the moral is Pretty much present in every single episode of Big O - that is true.

377
00:28:24,514 --> 00:28:26,560
Speaker 1: It just plays out over and over and over again.

378
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:34,955
Speaker 1: So if you watch the first six or seven episodes and you can't figure out where the show is going You might want to brush up on your plot.

379
00:28:34,975 --> 00:28:35,780
Speaker 1: predicting skills

380
00:28:36,122 --> 00:28:50,239
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if you can't figure it out even after the first season of Big O which I guess I can somewhat understand if you don't know what's gonna happen after like The first two episodes of Big O - or just in the first one episode of Big O - you know every.

381
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:51,062
Speaker 0: you know That's it.

382
00:28:51,082 --> 00:28:55,254
Speaker 1: Just you know, everything that is basically every episode of Big O - does.

383
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,000
Speaker 1: it plays out in a different way?

384
00:28:57,201 --> 00:29:08,100
Speaker 1: It's always the same moral but it plays out sometimes in a funny way Sometimes in a serious way sometimes in a weird way sometimes in a super metaphorical way But every episode has the same kind of thread of who am I?

385
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:10,238
Speaker 1: Why do I exist?

386
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,018
Speaker 1: metaphysical extant kind of philosophy blah blah blah.

387
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:24,311
Speaker 1: Now I actually really really am satisfied with how the show ended as opposed to Big O one Which I would have killed people if they hadn't continued it.

388
00:29:24,371 --> 00:29:27,967
Speaker 0: I just view the whole thing as one show called Big O. Yeah, but they're just this.

389
00:29:28,027 --> 00:29:33,476
Speaker 0: there's a separation where the second half starts like it Kinda like how I'd be about where this is the first half.

390
00:29:33,637 --> 00:29:38,780
Speaker 0: and then You know, there's the Jupiter jazz, whatever and there's the second half.

391
00:29:39,052 --> 00:29:40,627
Speaker 0: Yeah Only the thing is Callie bebop.

392
00:29:40,647 --> 00:29:49,735
Speaker 0: a lot of the episodes had nothing to do with the overall plot But in Big O all of them did But at the same time at the same kind of separation that Calvary bebop had in the two halves.

393
00:29:50,377 --> 00:29:51,240
Speaker 0: is that what Big O has?

394
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:51,589
Speaker 0: Yep

395
00:29:52,182 --> 00:30:08,923
Speaker 1: Now if you if you saw Big O one you weren't impressed and you're just not even considering Big O - I Highly recommend just watch the first DVD of Big O - in the very least because the first episode of Big O - which we've mentioned a couple times before is really really well done and Interesting.

396
00:30:09,887 --> 00:30:22,407
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think there's one problem with Big O is that it sort of Misrepresents itself in that a lot of people will watch like the first one and be like, oh, this is just Batman You know or it kind of is the first one.

397
00:30:22,427 --> 00:30:28,605
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're like, oh, this is just steam detectives clone with Batman and It sorta is.

398
00:30:28,705 --> 00:30:31,457
Speaker 0: but that's really just the setting and the.

399
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:39,733
Speaker 0: you know the the style and the items used in terms of Like the plot and act the characters and what happens.

400
00:30:39,834 --> 00:30:41,460
Speaker 0: it's totally not any of those things.

401
00:30:41,801 --> 00:30:44,952
Speaker 1: I mean the first 13 episodes are kind of just Flynn and they're not.

402
00:30:44,972 --> 00:30:56,095
Speaker 1: there's not really that much to them except if You watch Big O - and then you think back to Big O. one It won there's a lot more meaning there and you see a lot more.

403
00:30:56,758 --> 00:31:17,412
Speaker 1: and two You pull the whole anime logic thing because Utena had the same deal in Utena Which if any of you haven't seen it weird things happen like weird anime things like there's a magic arena where people fight duels and this castle in the sky like falls down on someone but they don't get killed and Most people watch the show and instead of thinking that was fucked up.

404
00:31:17,452 --> 00:31:18,294
Speaker 1: Why did that happen?

405
00:31:18,635 --> 00:31:20,020
Speaker 1: What the hell they think?

406
00:31:20,582 --> 00:31:22,389
Speaker 1: Oh, that's just the way this anime is.

407
00:31:22,449 --> 00:31:23,393
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna worry about it.

408
00:31:23,755 --> 00:31:31,920
Speaker 1: when then at the end of Utena They're like they explained like oh There was a reason why didn't I wonder why there's a frickin floating castle in the sky?

409
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,079
Speaker 1: There's actually a perfectly rational explanation for it.

410
00:31:34,341 --> 00:31:40,620
Speaker 0: It's one of those things where they make you suspend disbelief by putting the show on as a fantasy or a sci-fi.

411
00:31:41,561 --> 00:31:47,707
Speaker 0: but in reality, you shouldn't have suspended disbelief, you know, because It was actually real.

412
00:31:47,928 --> 00:31:51,280
Speaker 1: or I mean the big O is a very unrealistic robot.

413
00:31:51,441 --> 00:31:54,653
Speaker 1: It's big and it punches things in ways that you really can't do.

414
00:31:54,673 --> 00:31:56,259
Speaker 1: So think about that.

415
00:31:57,188 --> 00:31:58,098
Speaker 1: How could that actually be?

416
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:03,760
Speaker 1: Because it is in the show it happens and they explain it very directly in a very heavily handed way.

417
00:32:04,962 --> 00:32:08,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are a lot of things in the show actually that go completely unexp-.

418
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,040
Speaker 0: You know It's.

419
00:32:09,181 --> 00:32:15,240
Speaker 0: it's weird because they'll always look for a rational explanation for things and they'll always talk about things in a strange way.

420
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:19,040
Speaker 0: And you just you know, you think what the hell are they talking about?

421
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,580
Speaker 0: You know, what are the rules of the universe this show is in when the whole time?

422
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,071
Speaker 0: The show is in the same rules as our universe.

423
00:32:27,393 --> 00:32:31,091
Speaker 0: They're just making you suspend disbelief You know and tricking you into doing it when you shouldn't.

424
00:32:31,332 --> 00:32:32,800
Speaker 1: yeah big O one does it really well.

425
00:32:32,901 --> 00:32:38,260
Speaker 1: But notice even in big O one I mean half the time there's robots fighting and a quarter of the time there's funny stuff.

426
00:32:38,701 --> 00:32:43,900
Speaker 1: But a lot of the whole first season and much of the second season is just Roger talking to himself.

427
00:32:44,881 --> 00:32:52,310
Speaker 1: Now a lot of people just kind of gloss over what he's saying because it's just you know, typical Metaphil- Metaphilosophy blah blah blah.

428
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:59,864
Speaker 1: Oh, but if you really listen to the words he's saying that's what the whole show is about and There's actually a lot there.

429
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:08,040
Speaker 1: because I'm gonna go off on one of my philosophical things because I got a lot out of big O too And I'd I guess a spoiler warning.

430
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,039
Speaker 1: I'm gonna do my best not to ruin the show.

431
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:17,910
Speaker 1: But if you really are worried about big O too being ruined for you, you could probably stop listening At this point because we're not doing any meta bits after we talk about big O too.

432
00:33:19,267 --> 00:33:22,227
Speaker 1: but Basically consider the premise of big O too.

433
00:33:22,729 --> 00:33:25,499
Speaker 1: The premise is that for and big O 40 years ago.

434
00:33:26,141 --> 00:33:30,416
Speaker 1: Everyone lost their memories and no one knows what happened in the world before that time.

435
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,501
Speaker 1: There's no clue yet.

436
00:33:32,922 --> 00:33:46,105
Speaker 1: everyone just got on long with their lives and lived and played whatever roles they decided to play in the new world and The people who lived the best were the ones who didn't worry about what happened before or what came before Because there was really no way to know.

437
00:33:47,257 --> 00:33:49,378
Speaker 1: now That seems kind of weird.

438
00:33:49,418 --> 00:33:54,968
Speaker 1: You know, you don't know what happened 40 years ago And it's a very direct problem to these people and some people can't handle it.

439
00:33:55,832 --> 00:33:58,243
Speaker 1: But look at our world the real world the world.

440
00:33:58,263 --> 00:34:00,513
Speaker 1: We're in right now meet space We.

441
00:34:00,775 --> 00:34:04,270
Speaker 1: we have the same issue except it just it's much further into our history.

442
00:34:04,852 --> 00:34:15,893
Speaker 1: We don't know the history of humanity and we have a lot of theories but we really don't know what civilizations were and what happened to them and where people came from and what they did and why we're here now.

443
00:34:15,914 --> 00:34:28,449
Speaker 1: and But a lot of people don't think about it because it's so long ago that the only people who worry about it are Philosophers because most people they just think back and they don't really consider the fact that we have no clue where we came from.

444
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,716
Speaker 0: Historians think about it too.

445
00:34:29,877 --> 00:34:31,906
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they thought they actually figured out a lot.

446
00:34:31,946 --> 00:34:35,100
Speaker 1: but yes Yes, but like I mean there I mean we know like.

447
00:34:35,502 --> 00:34:46,000
Speaker 1: I'm not saying Oh magic creation Whatever any of that BS But definitely there are civilizations that we know almost nothing about other than that they may have existed like the mice and I civilization cyclopeans.

448
00:34:46,121 --> 00:34:49,837
Speaker 1: yes, we but big o but big o did.

449
00:34:49,857 --> 00:35:00,630
Speaker 1: and I really like this is they took that idea that we don't know where we came from and They made it a present issue Instead of the point before which we don't know anything is millions and millions of years ago.

450
00:35:01,152 --> 00:35:06,452
Speaker 1: that point is within the lifespan of people who are alive in this world and It forces.

451
00:35:06,473 --> 00:35:21,863
Speaker 1: the whole show is just showing characters dealing with the fact that they can never know where they came from and as Roger concludes Realizing that it doesn't matter because you can choose to be whoever you are or whatever you are and the world around you is the world Around you and you can take it as you will.

452
00:35:23,451 --> 00:35:25,259
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, at least that's what I got out of it.

453
00:35:25,761 --> 00:35:27,167
Speaker 1: And I really like that because it's an.

454
00:35:27,468 --> 00:35:30,730
Speaker 1: it's an idea I actually hadn't considered before until I saw a big O.

455
00:35:32,252 --> 00:35:34,044
Speaker 0: Yeah, I probably would have gotten more out of.

456
00:35:34,104 --> 00:35:37,657
Speaker 0: it is just that I've been turned off by seeing the same.

457
00:35:37,938 --> 00:35:39,605
Speaker 0: It's something you know, it's like seen it before.

458
00:35:39,725 --> 00:35:52,008
Speaker 0: if it wasn't something I'd seen before Yeah, not specifically big O. But you know the same kind of thing, you know, it would have been like ooh They did something really cool there, but I've seen the same kind of thing like 20 times.

459
00:35:52,612 --> 00:35:58,548
Speaker 1: Yeah I've seen similar things and that they they have this kind of philosophical agenda and they use a robot to show it to you.

460
00:35:58,569 --> 00:36:02,787
Speaker 1: or It's a very, you know intellectual show like this.

461
00:36:03,472 --> 00:36:08,949
Speaker 1: But I've never seen a show that addressed the specific philosophical idea that big O addressed before.

462
00:36:10,292 --> 00:36:19,333
Speaker 1: Alright, I guess it's just just the idea of Take the the fact that we don't know where we came from and make it urgent make it recent make it something that you can't Just ignore.

463
00:36:19,353 --> 00:36:22,349
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then take characters and see how they react to it.

464
00:36:22,811 --> 00:36:28,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess I'm not really, you know, the it doesn't really matter which specific idea it could have been any philosophical idea.

465
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:32,410
Speaker 0: I'm just generally turned off by you know philosophical ideas.

466
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:43,970
Speaker 1: I definitely see where you're coming from and if big O hadn't been the specific idea that it was if it had been the same Idea Ava had or the same idea eska flown a head or if it had been any sort of rehash of an idea.

467
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,317
Speaker 1: That's just been an anime over and over.

468
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:51,624
Speaker 1: I probably would have hated big O - It's just that it happened to be about an issue that I hadn't really considered philosophically before.

469
00:36:51,945 --> 00:36:53,250
Speaker 1: that really made me like the show.

470
00:36:54,670 --> 00:37:01,950
Speaker 1: Hmm now if you were mad about the original ending to Evangelion don't watch big O - you're going to hate the end.

471
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:05,009
Speaker 1: It's the same thing except no one's gonna make a movie to explain what happened.

472
00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:09,124
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm They don't show you what happens physically because it doesn't matter.

473
00:37:09,446 --> 00:37:12,160
Speaker 1: just like the end of Ava The robots fighting didn't matter.

474
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,930
Speaker 1: all that mattered is what went on in Shinji's head.

475
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:20,764
Speaker 0: Yeah, see I used to be like all into this stuff Like I'd watch Ava and I'd be like, oh it was the best thing ever.

476
00:37:20,925 --> 00:37:23,301
Speaker 0: or like Akira where you know You don't really know what happens at the end.

477
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:29,824
Speaker 0: just kind of you know This vague metaphorical thing and I'd be like, oh I get it or I don't get it But and I would always be like who.

478
00:37:29,865 --> 00:37:41,184
Speaker 0: it was awesome Anyway, or you know something like that and it would be the greatest thing in the world and shows that were just kind of like You know normal where you see what physically happens and that's that we're kind of like.

479
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:43,350
Speaker 0: these aren't as smart as these other shows.

480
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,574
Speaker 0: They don't do anything for me.

481
00:37:45,216 --> 00:37:46,661
Speaker 0: But now it's like I've seen.

482
00:37:46,721 --> 00:38:02,127
Speaker 0: I must have seen a hundred shows just like this where Instead of instead of having an ending and then a moral or An ending with a moral they have a moral in place of an ending, you know, like they make the ending all for fun, you know.

483
00:38:02,147 --> 00:38:16,030
Speaker 0: and If you go and look at the IMDb top movies list I don't know if it's still number one but for the longest freaking time number one was The Godfather and I would be like, all right, that was a really good movie.

484
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:20,850
Speaker 0: But why is it, you know number one and why is it still there at number one?

485
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:24,349
Speaker 0: it doesn't really you know, is it really that much better than every other movie?

486
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:26,921
Speaker 0: and Then I started that thing.

487
00:38:26,941 --> 00:38:27,223
Speaker 0: I don't know.

488
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:27,969
Speaker 0: I've never finished it.

489
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:39,969
Speaker 0: I should go back to it where I was watching every single movie in the top 250 of IMDb and I saw a lot of freaking movies that were either like way out there in artsy and some that were just way normal.

490
00:38:39,989 --> 00:38:46,510
Speaker 0: and I realized the reason The Godfather is number one is because it's both at the same time.

491
00:38:47,511 --> 00:38:48,454
Speaker 0: It's not all.

492
00:38:48,474 --> 00:39:03,550
Speaker 0: you can watch it and it would just be a perfectly normal see everything that happens, you know mundane Unmeaningful plot movie but at this other at the exact same time It's the most meaningful movie with all kinds of symbolism and things all over the place.

493
00:39:04,253 --> 00:39:07,505
Speaker 0: But it doesn't make one instead of the other.

494
00:39:07,525 --> 00:39:08,730
Speaker 0: you the end of The Godfather.

495
00:39:08,911 --> 00:39:10,918
Speaker 0: It doesn't just turn into like metaphorical stuff.

496
00:39:10,938 --> 00:39:12,143
Speaker 0: You still see what's happening.

497
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,010
Speaker 0: You look at it and it's at the end.

498
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:14,392
Speaker 0: There's.

499
00:39:14,513 --> 00:39:19,539
Speaker 0: he's in the church, you know saying I do You know get rid of the devil.

500
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:24,619
Speaker 0: I won't do bad things whatever they do in church I don't remember exactly and they keep.

501
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,549
Speaker 0: they keep going back and forth between him and the church.

502
00:39:29,392 --> 00:39:37,474
Speaker 0: You know for that and the hitman that he told to kill people killing people and It's an action scene.

503
00:39:37,855 --> 00:39:51,022
Speaker 1: but at the same time it's as metaphorical and meaningful as you can get yep as opposed to say Evangelion where the original ending was literally they don't show you anything that happens and it's just Shinji in his head contemplating the meaning of existence.

504
00:39:51,042 --> 00:40:03,802
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm so I guess you know if you still Haven't seen enough crazy metaphorical endings to you know, turn you off to that sort of thing Then you'll probably still like big o2.

505
00:40:03,843 --> 00:40:05,672
Speaker 1: Yeah No See I can.

506
00:40:05,933 --> 00:40:10,690
Speaker 1: I never tire of a show that does that because that's all I'm there for at least for shows like this.

507
00:40:11,392 --> 00:40:13,721
Speaker 1: The only thing that tires me really as opposed to you.

508
00:40:13,781 --> 00:40:25,989
Speaker 1: or shows that try to do this But either do it about a philosophical con philosophical construct that's boring useless or Already done to death or a show that just does it poorly

509
00:40:26,951 --> 00:40:32,230
Speaker 0: Doing it poor doing anything poorly whether it's you know metaphorical or not is just poor to begin with.

510
00:40:32,651 --> 00:40:40,254
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess big o2 to me did this really well and you might you don't realize what it's doing right away But it.

511
00:40:40,956 --> 00:40:47,481
Speaker 1: I was extremely pleased with the ending and I'm extremely pleased with the ideas I've been churning about since I saw it.

512
00:40:48,144 --> 00:40:54,250
Speaker 0: I mean don't get me wrong I you know, I did like the show a whole lot and it did do what it did a lot better than other people have done.

513
00:40:55,393 --> 00:40:56,036
Speaker 1: You're coming from it.

514
00:40:56,057 --> 00:40:58,369
Speaker 1: just a lot of shows do this and but it's like.

515
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:02,342
Speaker 0: You know, okay, you taught me something new.

516
00:41:02,362 --> 00:41:03,686
Speaker 0: I learned a new philosophy.

517
00:41:03,706 --> 00:41:10,430
Speaker 0: Whoo You know, well, it's not like you enlighten me to some great amazingness.

518
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:24,687
Speaker 1: well, see this comes down to the argument Scott and I always have because I'm very philosophical and he's very pragmatic and Whenever we argue we always tend to go into exact opposite directions to the point that we're a hundred percent Diametrically opposed on every issue.

519
00:41:26,672 --> 00:41:28,096
Speaker 0: Hmm because philosophy is just bullshit.

520
00:41:28,297 --> 00:41:32,550
Speaker 1: see to me philosophy is the only thing that matters, but it's just talking and words.

521
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:34,874
Speaker 0: It's not a physical thing.

522
00:41:34,915 --> 00:41:35,476
Speaker 0: It's not real.

523
00:41:35,797 --> 00:41:36,419
Speaker 0: What does it matter?

524
00:41:36,821 --> 00:41:39,570
Speaker 1: See I stay up at night wondering about the mysteries of the universe.

525
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:43,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Just tell you not to.

526
00:41:44,505 --> 00:41:48,140
Speaker 1: yeah, exactly That's why I really like big O because well, it didn't say not to.

527
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,110
Speaker 1: it said to not worry, but to still seek the truth.

528
00:41:52,731 --> 00:41:55,900
Speaker 1: Of course it got complicated because uh, what's-his-name?

529
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,130
Speaker 0: didn't you notice that anyone who was seeking out memories got fucked?

530
00:42:00,272 --> 00:42:11,158
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I'm telling you not to seek out the truth But angel found the full truth and she was fine with it because that she realized what it was and it didn't destroy her What's-his-name?

531
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,405
Speaker 1: What was that guy's name?

532
00:42:12,425 --> 00:42:13,149
Speaker 1: the guy in the bandages?

533
00:42:14,474 --> 00:42:15,110
Speaker 0: Schwartz Oswald.

534
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:18,590
Speaker 1: Schwartzwald found the truth and couldn't handle it and died.

535
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:22,645
Speaker 1: Rosewater found the truth and freaked out and that was the end of him.

536
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:26,629
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Angel found the truth and almost freaked out but then dealt with it.

537
00:42:27,072 --> 00:42:30,390
Speaker 0: Well didn't Gordon Rosewater make the truth and made himself forget or something?

538
00:42:30,811 --> 00:42:54,763
Speaker 1: See there's a super spoilers from this point on like if you haven't seen the show to stop listening right now Seriously, but Rosewater it like I get the feeling that They the one of the points they made is that at least in this show because at the end of Big O Like you like all of you saw it it pans back and you discover that the whole world was just a stage like literally stage lights in the sky and machinery outside.

539
00:42:54,823 --> 00:43:02,693
Speaker 1: may it Manning the stage and it seems to hint at the idea that an Omniscient being like God couldn't exist because he would.

540
00:43:03,195 --> 00:43:13,659
Speaker 1: there's nothing to live for being Omnipotent and he would create a world in which people could exist and the deny himself memory of doing so Thus allowing people to exist with free will.

541
00:43:14,527 --> 00:43:23,515
Speaker 1: mm-hmm, and That's at least one way to interpret it and it seems to me that Rosewater is a God who's forgotten that he's God willingly And that his son.

542
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,187
Speaker 1: Well, his son was just dumb.

543
00:43:26,831 --> 00:43:28,700
Speaker 1: I don't know what I was up with that.

544
00:43:29,442 --> 00:43:33,455
Speaker 0: He started out in Big O one is like the mysterious big evil guy.

545
00:43:33,916 --> 00:43:40,080
Speaker 0: and then towards the end of Big O one You actually saw him a couple times and he talked and he was there and it was just like hey, how you doing?

546
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,794
Speaker 0: It wasn't like whoa, you're the big bad guy.

547
00:43:42,814 --> 00:43:43,860
Speaker 0: It was like hey, what's up?

548
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:53,251
Speaker 0: And then in Big O - he was just dumb dumb as a brick and out there doing all kinds of crazy stuff Yeah unbefitting of a big evil character like the Emperor someone.

549
00:43:53,372 --> 00:43:58,788
Speaker 1: but I realized I like how they did that in the sense that in Big O one you don't see a lot of Gordon Rosewater.

550
00:43:59,389 --> 00:44:03,699
Speaker 1: and when you see him or Alex Rosewater Alex Alex Rose Yeah, Gordon's the father.

551
00:44:04,382 --> 00:44:10,500
Speaker 1: But when he's there he like you see him for a second and he says something and he seems very intelligent.

552
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:15,505
Speaker 1: superficially and even in Big O - Superficially, he's very intelligent and very wise.

553
00:44:15,766 --> 00:44:37,312
Speaker 1: like he sits there eating fine meals with that pretentious music playing in the background Constantly telling himself that he's doing the right thing constantly just spouting philosophy that he doesn't seem to understand himself and Big O - as you get to know this character more and more you realize that he's full of shit and he doesn't know anything and He's just an idiot who happens to be in a place of power.

554
00:44:37,995 --> 00:44:40,870
Speaker 1: and I kind of like how they did that How there was no villain.

555
00:44:41,232 --> 00:44:47,072
Speaker 1: there was just one idiot One senile God and then a bunch of people trying to figure out what was going on.

556
00:44:47,212 --> 00:44:49,379
Speaker 0: Well, no, what's-his-name was the villain?

557
00:44:50,613 --> 00:44:52,045
Speaker 1: Oh Alan Gabriel.

558
00:44:52,125 --> 00:44:53,653
Speaker 0: Alan Gabriel is was a villain.

559
00:44:53,694 --> 00:44:54,759
Speaker 0: He was a bad guy.

560
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:58,380
Speaker 1: See, I think the reason he was a villain because I know Alan you made a good point.

561
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:04,166
Speaker 1: I didn't think of that Alan Gabriel is really the only villain in all of Big O. Yeah, no one else is a villain.

562
00:45:04,187 --> 00:45:05,773
Speaker 1: They may do bad things, but they know.

563
00:45:06,034 --> 00:45:09,107
Speaker 0: Beck started out as a villain But he unvillain, but he wasn't.

564
00:45:09,328 --> 00:45:10,533
Speaker 1: I don't consider him a villain.

565
00:45:10,714 --> 00:45:12,020
Speaker 1: He was just an antagonist.

566
00:45:13,041 --> 00:45:20,353
Speaker 0: No, I think he was actually a villain in the first like episode or two when he first did bad And then we broke out of jail on his own.

567
00:45:20,373 --> 00:45:26,354
Speaker 0: in that other episode He was still a villain But then after that second time he appeared and he was done.

568
00:45:26,414 --> 00:45:27,638
Speaker 0: for then he unvillain.

569
00:45:27,859 --> 00:45:36,171
Speaker 1: see now Here's where I disagree with you because to me Beck wasn't a villain He was just playing this role just like Roger Smith was playing his role.

570
00:45:36,612 --> 00:45:45,679
Speaker 1: because notice that while Beck did whore tried to do horrible things he always had the sense of style and the sense of morals and he never stepped over the line.

571
00:45:45,699 --> 00:45:50,620
Speaker 1: and Alan Gabriel is the only character in the show that has no morals whatsoever.

572
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:57,645
Speaker 1: he has absolutely no compunction against doing anything and he forces back to step over the line and Beck can't deal with that.

573
00:45:58,549 --> 00:46:00,417
Speaker 1: and even in the beginning when Beck does is evil.

574
00:46:00,477 --> 00:46:02,708
Speaker 1: He's not a villain He's not the villain of the show.

575
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:04,900
Speaker 1: He's just an antagonist and a plot point.

576
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,706
Speaker 0: No, if you've never.

577
00:46:07,847 --> 00:46:14,140
Speaker 0: when I first saw the show ever and like the first two episodes I was like, all right back that bastard go get him, you know, he was a bad.

578
00:46:14,442 --> 00:46:17,179
Speaker 1: Definitely Beck that bastard go get him, but I wouldn't use the word villain.

579
00:46:18,843 --> 00:46:22,420
Speaker 0: I would at least if you only watch the first two episodes of the big O one.

580
00:46:22,681 --> 00:46:26,719
Speaker 1: Well, if you watch big O one and that yeah, but if you watch all the big O one you'd think Alex is the villain.

581
00:46:27,464 --> 00:46:27,927
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's.

582
00:46:27,987 --> 00:46:32,740
Speaker 0: if I watched one and two again You wouldn't be viewed as a villain because I've already seen the whole thing.

583
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:37,040
Speaker 0: But when I remember that when I watched it fresh, he seemed like a villain right away.

584
00:46:37,841 --> 00:46:53,879
Speaker 1: So yes to me because having seen the whole show the only character I can justify calling a villain is Alan Gabriel Because he everyone does what they do for a reason and everyone who do whatever they do They believe that they're in the right or at least they know they're in the wrong and they've dealt with that.

585
00:46:54,601 --> 00:46:57,528
Speaker 1: Alan Gabriel doesn't care right or wrong anything.

586
00:46:57,568 --> 00:46:59,092
Speaker 1: He has absolutely no direction.

587
00:46:59,212 --> 00:47:04,889
Speaker 1: He's just doing whatever the hell he wants for fun and Whatever the hell he wants tends to involve hurting people.

588
00:47:05,491 --> 00:47:07,056
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's not even after the truth.

589
00:47:07,097 --> 00:47:10,647
Speaker 1: He's not after anything I don't know.

590
00:47:10,687 --> 00:47:11,753
Speaker 0: You know, it's just you never know.

591
00:47:11,793 --> 00:47:23,310
Speaker 0: what he's thinking is the thing He might be thinking that you know He might have some crazy whack job plan where if he does this and this and this then he'll somehow get something But he doesn't ever get anything.

592
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:31,540
Speaker 0: So either his whack job plan isn't working or At some point he like his whack job plan fails and he gives up on it and goes crazy.

593
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:36,780
Speaker 0: But you don't realize it because you didn't know his whack job plan to begin with, you know, but I don't know.

594
00:47:37,101 --> 00:47:43,603
Speaker 1: I think I mean cuz Roger Smith was kind of obsessed with memory and that's what was keeping him down and preventing him from Realizing what he was.

595
00:47:44,525 --> 00:47:49,800
Speaker 1: and once he realized what he was he didn't like get rid of the idea of memory.

596
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:51,106
Speaker 1: He still cherishes the memories.

597
00:47:51,146 --> 00:47:51,648
Speaker 1: He has.

598
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:57,139
Speaker 1: he cherishes the past looks forward to the future But he lives in the present as opposed to living in the past.

599
00:47:57,902 --> 00:48:04,665
Speaker 1: Alan Gabriel lives in the present, but he ignores the past completely Mm-hmm.

600
00:48:05,006 --> 00:48:05,508
Speaker 1: He acts.

601
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:08,699
Speaker 1: one moment is completely separate from any other moment in his life.

602
00:48:09,542 --> 00:48:15,743
Speaker 0: But notice how is Roger like gets better and better and understands what's going on more and more He.

603
00:48:15,763 --> 00:48:19,060
Speaker 0: it's like when he stops trying to worry about memories.

604
00:48:19,682 --> 00:48:22,472
Speaker 0: He gets more memories of how to do awesome things with the robot.

605
00:48:22,713 --> 00:48:27,924
Speaker 1: Yes, the robot is definitely a metaphorical Device through the entire see.

606
00:48:27,965 --> 00:48:29,108
Speaker 0: that's the good kind of thing.

607
00:48:29,128 --> 00:48:38,760
Speaker 0: is where you have, you know, the completely mundane action But you also have the meaning and it's together in the same thing because at first they did that perfectly.

608
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,790
Speaker 1: Remember when I angel discovered the studio where she'd grown up.

609
00:48:43,261 --> 00:48:52,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was very much the metaphor and mundane plot going on at the same time And I think if they'd had more episodes and more money they could have constructed an ending for the whole show.

610
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:52,822
Speaker 1: That was similar.

611
00:48:53,364 --> 00:48:53,906
Speaker 0: You know what it is.

612
00:48:54,007 --> 00:48:55,552
Speaker 1: It's like they took the easy way out.

613
00:48:55,592 --> 00:48:56,596
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, it's like.

614
00:48:57,379 --> 00:48:57,720
Speaker 0: it's like.

615
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:01,658
Speaker 0: You know when you read a book and you read in between the lines, it's not.

616
00:49:01,799 --> 00:49:01,980
Speaker 0: you know.

617
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,349
Speaker 0: They don't actually write down what their meaning is.

618
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:11,880
Speaker 0: You're just reading a perfectly normal story But there's a meaning there and you have to extract it by thinking about what you just read.

619
00:49:12,702 --> 00:49:29,959
Speaker 0: But it seems that a lot of these animes that try to or you know Especially animes but also TV shows and movies that try to be meaningful What they do is they might make you read between the lines the whole way but at the end They just take what is written in between the lines and put it in bold text at the end.

620
00:49:30,525 --> 00:49:31,740
Speaker 0: And that's what I kind of don't like.

621
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:36,320
Speaker 0: I wish I could just read between the lines the whole time and that stupid people would you know?

622
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,119
Speaker 0: Maintain the thing where they didn't see anything between the lines.

623
00:49:40,024 --> 00:49:41,139
Speaker 1: Well, look at the end of trygun.

624
00:49:42,241 --> 00:49:43,907
Speaker 1: Alright, I'm gonna spoil the end of trygun.

625
00:49:44,248 --> 00:50:06,670
Speaker 1: So if anyone who is afraid of spoilers, but is still listening I'm swelling trygun now, too but I think that did it very well because the the moral, you know, no killing whatever because he doesn't kill knives at the end is There and if you read these on lines You can see all the conflict and the fact that he decided he's going to kill knives throughout the entire final fight And it's not until the very end when he decides not to.

626
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:07,352
Speaker 1: but then he doesn't.

627
00:50:07,974 --> 00:50:09,882
Speaker 1: and they don't do a crazy metaphor Whatever.

628
00:50:09,922 --> 00:50:12,215
Speaker 1: they just show him carrying knives back to town and that's the end.

629
00:50:12,819 --> 00:50:13,663
Speaker 0: Yep That's a.

630
00:50:13,924 --> 00:50:21,828
Speaker 1: and if you watch the fight and you watch the expressions on his face I mean if you don't notice any of that You just see an awesome fight and then the show ends.

631
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:26,819
Speaker 1: and if you watch his face and you pay attention to what's going on You get all that other meaning as well.

632
00:50:27,301 --> 00:50:36,734
Speaker 1: But the show isn't ruined for the people who don't get the metaphor nor is it ruined for the people who don't care about the action Mm-hmm, and we've gone on really long about that.

633
00:50:36,794 --> 00:50:38,039
Speaker 1: So I think that's a good stopping point.

634
00:50:38,561 --> 00:50:49,997
Speaker 1: All right, sure, and that was geek nights with rim and Scott special.
