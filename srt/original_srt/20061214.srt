1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,535
Speaker 1: It's Thursday December 14th.

2
00:00:12,017 --> 00:00:15,206
Speaker 1: I'm rim and I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:16,369
Speaker 1: We talk about the barge.

4
00:00:18,531 --> 00:00:19,526
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:21,533
Speaker 0: Fuck this show.

6
00:00:21,613 --> 00:00:23,157
Speaker 1: I quit what it's over.

7
00:00:23,558 --> 00:00:26,366
Speaker 0: No, not really sure we could stop anytime.

8
00:00:26,407 --> 00:00:27,470
Speaker 1: We could just stop right now.

9
00:00:27,952 --> 00:00:28,376
Speaker 0: I just.

10
00:00:28,497 --> 00:00:30,230
Speaker 0: I really don't feel like doing a show today.

11
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:42,818
Speaker 1: I think part of that is because we started a lot later than we planned on mostly because we didn't have an idea for the show and Despite the fact that our listeners and me Both all wanted another zombie episode.

12
00:00:42,838 --> 00:00:44,121
Speaker 1: Scott wasn't up to the challenge.

13
00:00:44,342 --> 00:00:45,886
Speaker 0: Well, it's not the challenge.

14
00:00:45,926 --> 00:00:47,330
Speaker 0: It's not motivated.

15
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,085
Speaker 0: I don't really care.

16
00:00:48,146 --> 00:00:49,454
Speaker 1: hence You're not up to the challenge.

17
00:00:49,534 --> 00:00:54,010
Speaker 1: the challenge of doing another one of these important documentaries that'll someday save lives.

18
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't really want to do that episode and I was all about it.

19
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,608
Speaker 1: I knew exactly what I was gonna talk about.

20
00:00:59,212 --> 00:01:00,698
Speaker 0: Yeah, why don't you do the show on your own then?

21
00:01:00,758 --> 00:01:06,139
Speaker 1: big shot see I've tried to do shows on my own and I could But it's usually not as entertaining.

22
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,669
Speaker 1: entertaining is having more than one person on the show.

23
00:01:09,431 --> 00:01:14,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, any one person talking at a podcast for more than about 15 minutes really starts to drag.

24
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:26,368
Speaker 1: Well, it works in video podcasts for some reason but not the not for me not the audio ones Other than ask a ninja which I don't find funny anymore Probably just due to the fact that they're all pretty much the same kind of like strong bad.

25
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:28,696
Speaker 1: Yep I can't stand any video podcast.

26
00:01:29,197 --> 00:01:32,587
Speaker 0: Well, I just found a new video podcast today that I thought was pretty cool.

27
00:01:32,908 --> 00:01:33,209
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

28
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:37,490
Speaker 1: So yeah, yeah, I just want I don't have time to sit and watch something like that.

29
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,339
Speaker 1: Anyway between all the anime definitely got to keep it short.

30
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,012
Speaker 0: if they want me to watch if it's like actually a TV show Forget it.

31
00:01:44,032 --> 00:01:46,341
Speaker 0: I don't have time to watch TV shows and I don't time to.

32
00:01:46,382 --> 00:01:52,565
Speaker 1: I don't know if there were a pseudopod equivalent Videocast where it was basically just horror fiction acted out.

33
00:01:52,606 --> 00:01:53,449
Speaker 1: I'd be all about that.

34
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,789
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know when I'd watch it.

35
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,370
Speaker 0: I mean event if there were too many of those we could just get rid of Netflix and just watch those instead.

36
00:02:01,193 --> 00:02:02,067
Speaker 1: That's kind of what I want.

37
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:09,053
Speaker 1: Netflix is a temporary patch in my life because it allows me to get all the movies I want to see at a rate.

38
00:02:09,152 --> 00:02:11,562
Speaker 1: I can watch them legally and for almost no money.

39
00:02:12,224 --> 00:02:17,280
Speaker 1: It would be alright, but whatever Yeah, but yeah, we were gonna do the zombie show.

40
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:19,006
Speaker 1: Scott wasn't up to the challenge.

41
00:02:19,287 --> 00:02:20,270
Speaker 1: then we didn't have a show.

42
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:22,314
Speaker 0: And now we have a show.

43
00:02:22,415 --> 00:02:23,217
Speaker 1: we've got a show.

44
00:02:23,237 --> 00:02:23,979
Speaker 0: We don't have a show.

45
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:25,945
Speaker 1: You can't do ten shows whatever.

46
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:27,770
Speaker 1: you can't make ten swags.

47
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,118
Speaker 0: No, we're gonna this weekend.

48
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:30,842
Speaker 0: That's what we're gonna do.

49
00:02:30,903 --> 00:02:32,049
Speaker 0: is we're gonna make swag?

50
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:38,710
Speaker 1: Well, we're gonna start the process of considering the possibility of beginning the production of the first piece of swag.

51
00:02:39,771 --> 00:02:42,183
Speaker 0: No, I'm pretty sure we're gonna finish the first piece of swag.

52
00:02:42,344 --> 00:02:43,590
Speaker 0: How what do you mean?

53
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,601
Speaker 1: How are we gonna finish the first piece of swag?

54
00:02:46,043 --> 00:02:46,727
Speaker 0: We'll just make it.

55
00:02:47,351 --> 00:02:48,980
Speaker 1: Well, what design are we gonna use?

56
00:02:49,021 --> 00:02:50,449
Speaker 1: What art is going to go on this?

57
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:52,745
Speaker 0: It won't be too hard.

58
00:02:54,033 --> 00:03:00,790
Speaker 0: What are you gonna do, but you're gonna draw something If it take me a long time, but I could know you couldn't it would just take a long time.

59
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:01,977
Speaker 0: No, you couldn't do it at all.

60
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,230
Speaker 0: If given enough time I could do it.

61
00:03:04,431 --> 00:03:06,983
Speaker 1: I don't think given any amount of time takes a good artist.

62
00:03:07,043 --> 00:03:09,232
Speaker 0: five minutes takes me five days But I can.

63
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:15,529
Speaker 1: I don't think you could do in five days what Emily or Yuko or any of our artist friends can do.

64
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:18,238
Speaker 0: Well not in the same amount of time.

65
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,163
Speaker 1: No in five days.

66
00:03:19,203 --> 00:03:20,570
Speaker 1: You couldn't do what they can do in five minutes.

67
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,017
Speaker 1: I'll say that right now and neither can I.

68
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:24,870
Speaker 0: I could if I didn't sleep and I spent all the time working.

69
00:03:25,374 --> 00:03:27,230
Speaker 0: No is but I probably couldn't do that.

70
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:32,488
Speaker 1: I think all you do is eventually wear a hole through the piece of paper as you kept drawing a stick figure erasing it And on it slightly crook.

71
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,428
Speaker 0: Eventually, it'd be the best damn stick figure the world ever saw.

72
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:39,269
Speaker 0: I'd be the stick figure master.

73
00:03:40,131 --> 00:03:44,203
Speaker 1: Yeah, the fact is we haven't really picked swag yet other than the generic swag.

74
00:03:44,745 --> 00:03:45,648
Speaker 0: We're working on it.

75
00:03:45,788 --> 00:03:46,330
Speaker 1: No, we're not.

76
00:03:46,551 --> 00:03:47,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, we haven't worked on it at all.

77
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,087
Speaker 1: We've been working on the DVD.

78
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:50,895
Speaker 0: this weekend We got nothing and next weekend.

79
00:03:50,915 --> 00:03:51,457
Speaker 0: We got nothing.

80
00:03:51,477 --> 00:03:53,345
Speaker 0: So we're gonna be working on next weekend's Christmas.

81
00:03:53,405 --> 00:03:54,670
Speaker 1: I'll probably be going somewhere.

82
00:03:54,871 --> 00:03:55,814
Speaker 0: Are you gonna go somewhere?

83
00:03:55,894 --> 00:03:57,780
Speaker 0: probably I'll sit here and work on swag.

84
00:03:58,182 --> 00:04:00,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did put together one thing.

85
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,337
Speaker 1: The outtakes reel is almost done.

86
00:04:02,357 --> 00:04:12,990
Speaker 1: I put together every outtake we have From the first season and sadly there's only one outtake so far from the second season and it's four seconds long.

87
00:04:13,812 --> 00:04:15,830
Speaker 0: Well, you know, it's a good thing.

88
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,608
Speaker 0: We're trying to run this episode a little long because we don't got much to say today.

89
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:22,390
Speaker 1: No, no, just the DVD is gonna be pretty cool.

90
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:29,065
Speaker 1: You can hear the outtakes you'll hear like when we do interviews the prep talk and the post talk that you might not have otherwise heard.

91
00:04:30,032 --> 00:04:36,021
Speaker 1: Most of the outtakes are honestly from the first month of geek nights Where we didn't know how to deal with what we do when we fuck up.

92
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,069
Speaker 1: So here I'll act out say we fuck up.

93
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:47,501
Speaker 1: now it's like and so in the news the consumer advocacy Consumer advocacy group and that's how we deal with things back in the day.

94
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:49,146
Speaker 1: It'd be like consumer advocacy.

95
00:04:49,587 --> 00:04:49,868
Speaker 1: Fuck.

96
00:04:49,908 --> 00:04:50,610
Speaker 1: I fucked up the show.

97
00:04:53,212 --> 00:04:58,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, we got to totally cut that out fuck Haha, and then we get going and we had a bunch of outtakes like that.

98
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,926
Speaker 1: But now it's sad to say but I guess we've become professionals.

99
00:05:02,987 --> 00:05:03,850
Speaker 1: There's no more outtakes.

100
00:05:04,611 --> 00:05:05,958
Speaker 0: Well, no more outtakes like that.

101
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,030
Speaker 1: The only outtakes we ever had.

102
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:12,169
Speaker 0: I think the real thing is that we do stuff that could be considered outtakes, but you don't take it out.

103
00:05:12,795 --> 00:05:13,989
Speaker 0: So it's not really an outtake.

104
00:05:15,151 --> 00:05:18,445
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, we've almost cut nothing out of the show.

105
00:05:18,505 --> 00:05:27,108
Speaker 1: anyway at this point I cut out, you know The the 20 seconds of silence from when I hit record until one of us says something and I cut out the.

106
00:05:27,128 --> 00:05:27,750
Speaker 1: so are we?

107
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:28,091
Speaker 1: Done.

108
00:05:28,132 --> 00:05:29,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're done at the end.

109
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:35,730
Speaker 1: I Guess I could save that for a year and then put them all in a row next year for the DVD - so we're done.

110
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,292
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're done.

111
00:05:36,372 --> 00:05:37,135
Speaker 0: We're done.

112
00:05:37,175 --> 00:05:37,657
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're done.

113
00:05:37,898 --> 00:05:38,861
Speaker 1: So I'm going to bed.

114
00:05:39,102 --> 00:05:39,804
Speaker 0: Yep Scott.

115
00:05:39,825 --> 00:05:41,210
Speaker 1: You're making the post fuck you click.

116
00:05:42,751 --> 00:05:43,051
Speaker 0: Great.

117
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:45,860
Speaker 0: Okay, so got a news action.

118
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,247
Speaker 1: I've got a news from the year.

119
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,735
Speaker 0: I was born But that's not news.

120
00:05:50,775 --> 00:05:51,237
Speaker 0: then is it?

121
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:52,362
Speaker 1: it's not news.

122
00:05:52,563 --> 00:05:53,990
Speaker 1: It's geek nights great.

123
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,360
Speaker 1: Actually, I bring it up because it's on dig.

124
00:05:57,721 --> 00:05:59,046
Speaker 1: It's been all over dig.

125
00:05:59,086 --> 00:05:59,950
Speaker 1: It's been all over Fark.

126
00:06:00,092 --> 00:06:01,129
Speaker 1: It's on the internet again.

127
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:14,030
Speaker 1: and the thing is I have seen this come back on the internet every single year for the past five or six years at least and Despite that every time it comes around a lot of people haven't read it and don't realize the truth.

128
00:06:14,955 --> 00:06:20,961
Speaker 1: You see I'll put it very very briefly Diamonds are not actually valuable.

129
00:06:21,322 --> 00:06:23,270
Speaker 1: They're in fact quite common.

130
00:06:25,032 --> 00:06:31,156
Speaker 1: Their worth is generated solely by restricted supply Coupled with intense marketing.

131
00:06:31,177 --> 00:06:37,479
Speaker 1: the primary market of diamonds is the United States because the rest of the world long ago Realized that they're not really worth it.

132
00:06:37,901 --> 00:06:39,148
Speaker 0: Well most of the rest of the world.

133
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:43,290
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, I mean they're Africa actually knows exactly how much they're worth.

134
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:52,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, they know that they're worth a lot because they can sell them for a lot of money to idiots in this country, yeah But yet their diamonds are aplenty.

135
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,714
Speaker 0: you can go around the world and if you add up all the diamonds There's lots of them.

136
00:06:56,754 --> 00:07:01,245
Speaker 0: There's a lot more diamonds than there is gold or platinum or silver or anything.

137
00:07:01,566 --> 00:07:05,123
Speaker 0: There's shit tons of these things and they're not worth much.

138
00:07:05,264 --> 00:07:18,028
Speaker 0: but De Beers is one company that gets a lot of diamonds and they put most of them in a vault thus artificially reducing the supply and then they heavily marketed them for many years.

139
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:19,912
Speaker 0: so that Get.

140
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:21,797
Speaker 0: not getting a diamond is unthinkable.

141
00:07:22,118 --> 00:07:26,310
Speaker 0: If you're getting married or engaged or anything like that, you know, you must get one.

142
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:30,981
Speaker 0: Therefore they have artificially increased the demand a bajillion fold.

143
00:07:31,463 --> 00:07:36,589
Speaker 0: and here you have it a bunch of idiots with too much money Spending them on useless common rocks.

144
00:07:36,952 --> 00:07:54,370
Speaker 1: I mean quite seriously if you look at the history of Diamond-purchasing in the United States and compare it to when advertising efforts of De Beers began and the cartel and everything The there's pretty much a one-to-one Correlation between them marketing diamonds and diamonds selling and before that there was no tradition of diamonds being used for much.

145
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:58,125
Speaker 0: Yeah, we think in 1800s people bought diamonds like when they got married.

146
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,230
Speaker 0: There was none of that shit.

147
00:07:59,431 --> 00:08:05,601
Speaker 1: I mean they might have bought a really really cheap diamond like a poorly cut Really cheap thing that maybe cost him a week salary.

148
00:08:05,681 --> 00:08:07,669
Speaker 1: if that and even then most people didn't.

149
00:08:08,231 --> 00:08:16,777
Speaker 0: This whole wedding thing that you know, the whole diamond wedding ring Tradition is even a hundred years old.

150
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:19,386
Speaker 0: not even yeah face.

151
00:08:19,446 --> 00:08:20,550
Speaker 1: I don't want to go through the whole thing.

152
00:08:20,951 --> 00:08:32,070
Speaker 1: I highly recommend if you don't know much about the diamond industry or you've ever considered purchasing a diamond That you read this article because I can safely say that I'll probably never in my life purchase a diamond on purpose.

153
00:08:32,815 --> 00:08:35,250
Speaker 1: I mean if I really less it's in a computer motherboard.

154
00:08:36,073 --> 00:08:42,275
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, I mean if I really needed a shiny useless rock I would buy one that was Manufactured and much cheaper.

155
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:43,941
Speaker 0: Yeah, then you could choose the color.

156
00:08:44,261 --> 00:08:46,610
Speaker 1: remember scientists can make diamonds straight up.

157
00:08:46,711 --> 00:08:48,189
Speaker 1: You could just make them in a machine.

158
00:08:48,391 --> 00:08:54,597
Speaker 0: We're not talking about like making something that looks like a diamond and feels like a diamond but isn't the time We're talking about making a diamond?

159
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,138
Speaker 0: it comes out.

160
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:56,102
Speaker 0: It is a dime.

161
00:08:56,122 --> 00:08:58,430
Speaker 1: In fact, not only is it a diamond but it's perfect.

162
00:08:58,691 --> 00:09:00,057
Speaker 1: It is absolutely flawless.

163
00:09:00,117 --> 00:09:02,970
Speaker 1: It is better than any diamond you could ever find in the ground.

164
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:09,730
Speaker 1: You can make it whatever color you want can make whatever size you want cut it however you want It'll have no imperfections whatsoever.

165
00:09:10,152 --> 00:09:13,529
Speaker 0: Yeah, they have a machine that they can just put some stuff in it.

166
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:14,553
Speaker 0: You know carbon.

167
00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:15,095
Speaker 0: basically.

168
00:09:15,576 --> 00:09:19,229
Speaker 0: wait and out will come a yellow diamond the size of your fist.

169
00:09:20,257 --> 00:09:21,410
Speaker 1: Well, not quite your face.

170
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,599
Speaker 0: Well, they could if they wanted to but they don't.

171
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:27,680
Speaker 0: but I'm sure if they wanted to and they tried hard enough They can make one the size of your fist.

172
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,990
Speaker 1: Well, it really depends on the method.

173
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:32,570
Speaker 1: There are like four different machines that can make diamonds and they all work in different ways.

174
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:33,373
Speaker 1: They're all.

175
00:09:33,393 --> 00:09:34,176
Speaker 1: they're all pretty cool.

176
00:09:34,256 --> 00:09:35,079
Speaker 1: If you ever are bored.

177
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:38,290
Speaker 1: I highly reckon you read up about artificial diamonds artificial gem.

178
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,499
Speaker 0: There's a whole bunch of companies.

179
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,970
Speaker 0: I just don't remember any of their names right now.

180
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:42,432
Speaker 1: Genesis.

181
00:09:42,653 --> 00:09:43,758
Speaker 1: I believe that's one of them.

182
00:09:43,818 --> 00:09:44,280
Speaker 0: That's one.

183
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,766
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a whole bunch of them though.

184
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:46,750
Speaker 0: I don't think that's the best one.

185
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:47,528
Speaker 0: There's some better ones

186
00:09:47,891 --> 00:09:59,210
Speaker 1: yeah, but I really if you don't know read this article and hopefully you'll realize that Purchasing a diamond is not an investment and it's not worth even a quarter of the money you paid for

187
00:09:59,451 --> 00:10:06,337
Speaker 0: The other thing I did the only that last thing we didn't say about diamonds is that a lot of them when you buy them Down the chain.

188
00:10:06,378 --> 00:10:08,510
Speaker 0: The money is actually going to very bad people.

189
00:10:08,803 --> 00:10:19,310
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean even aside from the fact that it's a poor investment and that they're not actually valuable a lot of diamonds are Pretty much mine solely based on human suffering.

190
00:10:19,972 --> 00:10:25,186
Speaker 0: Well, they have a system where like diamonds are labeled and tracked and they have certificates and things.

191
00:10:25,206 --> 00:10:28,902
Speaker 0: so you can buy one and be Sure that yours isn't an evil one.

192
00:10:28,922 --> 00:10:30,229
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know where that came from.

193
00:10:31,112 --> 00:10:39,078
Speaker 1: the diamond industry noticed that people were starting to argue against diamonds because they called them blood diamonds the diamonds that Basically poor Africans were forced to mind.

194
00:10:39,098 --> 00:10:41,206
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know when people say conflict diamonds.

195
00:10:41,226 --> 00:10:42,170
Speaker 0: That's what they're talking about.

196
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:52,689
Speaker 1: So the diamond industry decided to start making certified diamonds that they guarantee to us weren't mined in Under those conditions and for those reasons, yeah, and they sell them for more money.

197
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:53,613
Speaker 0: Yep, they do.

198
00:10:53,793 --> 00:10:58,470
Speaker 0: But if they are certified you can be pretty sure that they're not blood diamonds, but if they're not certified.

199
00:10:59,171 --> 00:11:02,350
Speaker 0: Probably some slave in Africa was treated poorly.

200
00:11:02,892 --> 00:11:11,240
Speaker 0: It was forced to dig these diamonds out from the ground by an evil warlord who then used the money to buy a use The money to buy ak-47s for terrorists.

201
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,865
Speaker 0: and you just paid for those ak-47s.

202
00:11:12,946 --> 00:11:16,418
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah We just called a bunch of people in exchange.

203
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:18,286
Speaker 0: You got a useless rock now.

204
00:11:18,326 --> 00:11:19,350
Speaker 1: It's not totally useless.

205
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,600
Speaker 1: I mean you can cut small amounts of glass with it.

206
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,434
Speaker 0: Yes, but you can get a glass cutter for like 10 bucks at Home Depot.

207
00:11:24,837 --> 00:11:26,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably less than 10 bucks.

208
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:32,550
Speaker 0: This is a much more expensive glass cutter and a far less effective far less effective than the Home Depot version.

209
00:11:33,491 --> 00:11:38,510
Speaker 0: Anyway, I got I got some geek news here kind of geek news kind of I'm curious.

210
00:11:39,152 --> 00:11:40,397
Speaker 0: so the Detroit Tigers?

211
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:54,410
Speaker 0: they have a relief pitcher named Joel Zumaia and Last year, you know the Detroit Tigers are in the World Series and before you get to the World Series If you're in the American League, like the Tigers are you have to play in the American League Championship Series, which they won.

212
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:01,280
Speaker 0: but He missed out on Like three games of the American League Championship Series.

213
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,570
Speaker 1: No, why Scott did he miss out on three games of the American?

214
00:12:05,693 --> 00:12:08,210
Speaker 0: It hurt his team and they ended up not winning the World Series.

215
00:12:08,331 --> 00:12:11,590
Speaker 0: You know, who knows if it would have turned things around if he was playing in those games.

216
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,603
Speaker 1: Oh a Michigan non hockey team choking at the last minute.

217
00:12:14,743 --> 00:12:22,048
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway He didn't play in the games because his wrist hurt huh from pitching too much.

218
00:12:22,088 --> 00:12:24,416
Speaker 0: I imagined Yeah, that's what you would think.

219
00:12:24,476 --> 00:12:25,983
Speaker 0: No one even questioned it at the time.

220
00:12:26,003 --> 00:12:27,610
Speaker 0: Maybe he was in the World Series months ago.

221
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,639
Speaker 1: Maybe he was training and he hurt himself.

222
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:30,844
Speaker 1: He threw one too hard.

223
00:12:31,246 --> 00:12:32,150
Speaker 1: He was stretched wrong.

224
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,877
Speaker 1: He was lifting weights and he dropped one.

225
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,348
Speaker 0: Well, the first thing that's pretty sad is that he's younger than we are.

226
00:12:36,368 --> 00:12:37,352
Speaker 0: He's 22.

227
00:12:37,352 --> 00:12:49,253
Speaker 1: Ah, that's like when I see f1 drivers realize that they're actually young - yeah We're older than Fernando Alonso the world champion of Formula One who's got a bajillion dollars the video game pianist when we were all Hanging out with him.

228
00:12:49,293 --> 00:12:50,136
Speaker 1: We're like, how old are you?

229
00:12:50,217 --> 00:12:52,144
Speaker 1: and the number he told us was real sad.

230
00:12:52,164 --> 00:12:53,289
Speaker 0: It was very sad.

231
00:12:56,172 --> 00:12:56,674
Speaker 1: What do we do?

232
00:12:56,694 --> 00:12:58,142
Speaker 1: we're 25. we do a podcast.

233
00:12:58,423 --> 00:13:00,531
Speaker 1: yeah, I'm only 24.

234
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:02,120
Speaker 0: Yeah for like I'm still 24.

235
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:08,430
Speaker 1: like four weeks I am possibly one third to maybe one quarter of my life pass.

236
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:11,341
Speaker 0: Well, think about it in four weeks your insurance is gonna go down.

237
00:13:11,903 --> 00:13:13,529
Speaker 1: My insurance is already pretty much nothing.

238
00:13:14,031 --> 00:13:15,216
Speaker 0: It'll become negative then.

239
00:13:15,237 --> 00:13:17,748
Speaker 1: I pay like ten bucks a month for car insurance.

240
00:13:17,989 --> 00:13:22,690
Speaker 0: Anyway His wrist injury went away though, and he was fine in the World Series.

241
00:13:23,231 --> 00:13:26,701
Speaker 0: But just now he had discovered the cause of his wrist injury.

242
00:13:27,383 --> 00:13:31,359
Speaker 0: He played too much guitar hero now Perhaps a month ago.

243
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:44,499
Speaker 1: I would have said what that's stupid But having finally gotten a chance to play guitar heroes I have to say that I would probably be in a similar situation if I was a star pitcher for the Detroit Tigers and had Access to both guitar heroes and the World Series

244
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:44,740
Speaker 0: plus.

245
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,724
Speaker 0: He's a relief pitcher.

246
00:13:45,744 --> 00:13:47,590
Speaker 0: All right, and he's a baseball player.

247
00:13:47,691 --> 00:13:48,580
Speaker 0: He's got mad money's.

248
00:13:48,924 --> 00:13:49,510
Speaker 0: what's he doing?

249
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,830
Speaker 0: You know when he sits around for the first seven innings of the game before it's his turn to do anything.

250
00:13:53,830 --> 00:14:04,410
Speaker 1: Well after snorting the cocaine off of the hookers behind you play some fucking guitar heroes, bitch Man, guitar heroes is all shades of awesome and it was the thing that pushed us over the line of buying a ps2.

251
00:14:05,134 --> 00:14:09,774
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I think the other thing was I can get one for free with my Sony points Yeah, and then I'll buy.

252
00:14:09,794 --> 00:14:10,557
Speaker 0: check this out.

253
00:14:10,998 --> 00:14:13,225
Speaker 0: I've only ever had one credit card in my life.

254
00:14:13,366 --> 00:14:18,530
Speaker 0: I got it in Sophomore year of college, you know because I wanted to buy stuff online.

255
00:14:18,711 --> 00:14:22,970
Speaker 0: I didn't want to like get a line of credit and you know buy things without paying for them.

256
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:23,834
Speaker 0: I didn't care about that.

257
00:14:23,854 --> 00:14:24,597
Speaker 0: I had plenty of money.

258
00:14:24,858 --> 00:14:27,510
Speaker 0: Well plenty of money for what you know, I could afford.

259
00:14:28,251 --> 00:14:30,886
Speaker 0: But I couldn't buy anything online without a credit card.

260
00:14:30,906 --> 00:14:31,509
Speaker 0: I didn't have one.

261
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:34,590
Speaker 0: So rim says, you know, you can just go get one.

262
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,010
Speaker 0: You just fill out a form online and they'll mail you one.

263
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,234
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz I had a credit card since I was like 14.

264
00:14:39,234 --> 00:14:42,740
Speaker 0: So, yep so I went online and I said oh which one will I get?

265
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:48,223
Speaker 0: and I pretty much went to the first credit card website that Came up and there it was the Sony card.

266
00:14:48,464 --> 00:14:52,510
Speaker 0: for as much as we hate Sony I have had a Sony credit card for like six years.

267
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:57,490
Speaker 1: It's the only credit card I've ever had and so far we've gotten a cheap TV and now a free ps2 out of it.

268
00:14:57,711 --> 00:14:59,321
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's uh, it's working out.

269
00:14:59,382 --> 00:14:59,784
Speaker 0: Okay.

270
00:14:59,805 --> 00:15:02,038
Speaker 0: Yeah consider But it's so funny.

271
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,030
Speaker 0: It's like I go to the Nintendo World Store.

272
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:08,649
Speaker 0: I don't own a single Sony video game system and I buy a Wii with the Sony card.

273
00:15:10,812 --> 00:15:12,279
Speaker 1: Why didn't you buy a ps3?

274
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:14,410
Speaker 1: you could have flipped it on eBay for zero profit.

275
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:25,129
Speaker 0: Well, I would also gotten like how let's see if I bought a ps3 600 times three 18 I would have gotten like a hundred and eighty dollars worth of Sony points, huh?

276
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:29,613
Speaker 1: That would effectively been a hundred and eighty dollars off of ps3 Something like that.

277
00:15:29,653 --> 00:15:31,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know, what's so much a better deal?

278
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:36,739
Speaker 0: if I buy a plasma like a Sony LCD TV That's like two thousand dollars with my Sony card.

279
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:37,100
Speaker 0: Yeah.

280
00:15:37,723 --> 00:15:38,485
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

281
00:15:38,927 --> 00:15:39,570
Speaker 1: Why don't we do that?

282
00:15:40,531 --> 00:15:42,801
Speaker 0: Because we don't need a TV like that and I don't have $2,000.

283
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:43,604
Speaker 1: Yeah, you do.

284

Speaker 0: yeah But I don't have that much money for an LCD TV.

289
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,570
Speaker 1: What are you gonna spend that money on rent food and stuff?

290
00:16:04,632 --> 00:16:05,843
Speaker 1: Things of the day?

291
00:16:05,863 --> 00:16:07,555

Speaker 0: Well in it of it itself, it is not so awesome.

295
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:14,453
Speaker 0: You see what it is.

296
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:19,630
Speaker 0: It is a trailer for an upcoming documentary called nerdcore for life.

297
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,081
Speaker 0: Someone is making a documentary about nerdcore hip-hop.

298
00:16:23,462 --> 00:16:25,629
Speaker 0: And this is the trailer for said documentary.

299
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:32,058
Speaker 1: now that's either gonna be hilarious and awesome or Self aggrandizing and just totally lame.

300
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:35,470
Speaker 0: I don't really care about the actual documentary or the trailer.

301
00:16:35,892 --> 00:16:47,450
Speaker 0: What I do care about is that when you watch this trailer you can see Examples of every geekery that you know, we're into like this DDR plane.

302
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:49,990
Speaker 0: There's they're playing a game of Arkham horror.

303
00:16:50,271 --> 00:16:51,655
Speaker 0: There's some people role playing.

304
00:16:51,675 --> 00:16:52,778
Speaker 0: there's some people LARP in this.

305
00:16:52,818 --> 00:16:53,600
Speaker 0: people cosplay.

306
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,910
Speaker 0: these people reading manga is people playing video games.

307
00:16:57,331 --> 00:16:58,233
Speaker 0: It's everything.

308
00:16:58,694 --> 00:16:59,717
Speaker 0: so it's just.

309
00:17:00,058 --> 00:17:02,464
Speaker 0: you don't even need the audio on when you watch this thing.

310
00:17:02,845 --> 00:17:14,529
Speaker 0: you just watch it and it's this great montage of mosaic of geekeries that is quite Impressive to behold and awe-inspiring All right.

311
00:17:15,497 --> 00:17:21,767
Speaker 1: so in Japan They like to pull pranks on people as parts of pretty much all their daytime TV.

312
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:37,466
Speaker 1: as far as I can tell It seems like every show on TV in Japan at least shows that end up being put on YouTube over here in the US are either anime or talk shows with guys dressed up as women pulling pranks on people and yelling at famous rock stars

313
00:17:37,787 --> 00:17:38,408
Speaker 0: and hard gay

314
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,523
Speaker 1: and Hard gay is the category all by himself.

315
00:17:41,845 --> 00:17:43,989
Speaker 0: He is indeed anyway.

316
00:17:45,834 --> 00:17:56,026
Speaker 1: Now the other thing I've noticed about Japan over the years is that you can pull Pranks that border on Sadistic and yet there's no problem with this.

317
00:17:56,126 --> 00:17:56,870
Speaker 1: You don't get sued.

318
00:17:57,432 --> 00:18:00,603
Speaker 0: I think almost everybody that taught the porta-potty the toilet seat.

319
00:18:00,644 --> 00:18:02,410
Speaker 1: That's probably that's my favorite prank ever.

320
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,521
Speaker 1: Even I like that even more than the skeleton on the motorcycle.

321
00:18:05,661 --> 00:18:09,608
Speaker 0: No, I think the skeleton on the motorcycles the best one Vile corneas.

322
00:18:17,814 --> 00:18:20,248
Speaker 1: But I think the toilet one is probably the funniest to me.

323
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:37,721
Speaker 1: Yeah But this one here is not only I'm pretty sure this is real like they actually did this to some guy Because otherwise the guy acting like the guy who they got in this prank is a great actor because that is the perfect Representation of the oh shit.

324
00:18:37,801 --> 00:18:40,709
Speaker 1: I'm going to die face basic.

325
00:18:42,157 --> 00:18:52,270
Speaker 1: They tricked this guy I don't know how I don't understand Japanese and I heard like one or two words that I might have understood But I've gathered that they tricked him into getting into this cab.

326
00:18:52,913 --> 00:18:56,050
Speaker 1: Like take this cab will take you where we need to go for whatever like the attractive.

327
00:18:56,813 --> 00:18:58,662
Speaker 1: So he gets in this cab and he takes off.

328
00:18:59,184 --> 00:19:00,088
Speaker 0: He's not wearing a seat buck.

329
00:19:00,128 --> 00:19:04,356
Speaker 1: He's a dumbass taxi driver is uh Driving a little crazily.

330
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:09,255
Speaker 1: There's a camera hidden camera in the taxi so we can see Exactly what's going on in there?

331
00:19:09,275 --> 00:19:09,757
Speaker 1: Furthermore?

332
00:19:09,777 --> 00:19:14,298
Speaker 1: There are cameras along the route where you can see what the taxi is doing Right away.

333
00:19:14,338 --> 00:19:19,670
Speaker 1: It peels out starts drifting around Spinning out the guy's starting to really freak out.

334
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,435
Speaker 0: Then I'd freak out would you.

335
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:34,067
Speaker 1: then he really starts going fast like really fast and there's these Construction guys in the middle of the road and the guy in the backslide pointing like there's construction guys.

336
00:19:34,348 --> 00:19:46,141
Speaker 1: There's construction And he just like bowls right where he's about to hit him and he knocks the car up at an angle and drives on two wheels for a while Which it can be done in many cars.

337
00:19:46,422 --> 00:19:48,270
Speaker 0: I saw this great video the other day.

338
00:19:48,516 --> 00:19:57,450
Speaker 0: Oh, man If I'd make it a thing that maybe next week of some guys in Iraq stolen SUV And they pops it up onto two tires and they're driving it around.

339
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:58,572
Speaker 0: And I was.

340
00:19:58,693 --> 00:20:01,165
Speaker 0: I saw that video and I said there's nothing wrong with Iraq.

341
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:03,788
Speaker 0: It's all good over there Everything's cool.

342
00:20:04,331 --> 00:20:12,676
Speaker 1: See my general philosophy on people is that while a lot of people are really kind of dumb and a lot of people are Really kind of mean in general.

343
00:20:12,997 --> 00:20:17,110
Speaker 1: There are cool people everywhere in the world even in the shittiest part of Darfur.

344
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:22,383
Speaker 1: There's some kid who plays punch-for-punch with this other kid and just whales on him.

345
00:20:22,683 --> 00:20:25,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a kid who does some hotfoot somewhere.

346
00:20:27,657 --> 00:20:30,460
Speaker 1: There's Always cool kids no matter how bad the situation is.

347
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, you just watch city of God if you don't believe it.

348
00:20:33,411 --> 00:20:41,465
Speaker 1: Oh city of God, which is a semi almost kind of maybe based on a somewhat true story Yeah, something like that.

349
00:20:43,831 --> 00:20:53,910
Speaker 1: Anyway, so he pops it back down and the guy's freaking out and they have this conversation Which I think amounts to you should probably put on your seat belts and the guy puts on his seat belts.

350
00:20:55,152 --> 00:20:59,169
Speaker 1: So then the cab continues going and I can't really ruin it.

351
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:04,650
Speaker 1: Let's just say that all hell breaks loose and it ends with them actually crashing the cab.

352
00:21:04,891 --> 00:21:11,918
Speaker 0: Yeah, well they they drive to sort of this pre set up area with all sorts of with Hazard explosions.

353
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,030
Speaker 1: the car catches on fire the doors fall.

354
00:21:15,547 --> 00:21:26,278
Speaker 0: Oh they had some field and they set up a bunch of hazards in the field and the guy takes the car to the field and Drives through all the hazards and the cars on fire and shit For real like really on fire.

355
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:39,390
Speaker 0: The guy's totally freaking out as should be expected and the meanwhile the cab drivers driving totally legit just like The cab driver is clearly a professional driver and should drive some awesome race cars or something.

356
00:21:40,112 --> 00:21:43,300
Speaker 0: Maybe he's a professional like movie stunt driver, which it just is good.

357
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,706
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know though knowing Japan's record in f1.

358
00:21:45,746 --> 00:21:50,195
Speaker 1: Oh super agree Maybe that's it.

359
00:21:50,235 --> 00:21:51,900
Speaker 1: Maybe it's what's-his-name from super Gary.

360
00:21:52,221 --> 00:21:52,722
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

361
00:21:52,983 --> 00:21:53,886
Speaker 0: I know what he looks like.

362
00:21:54,186 --> 00:21:55,049
Speaker 1: What does he look like?

363
00:21:56,351 --> 00:21:57,558
Speaker 0: Little tiny Japanese man.

364
00:21:57,659 --> 00:21:59,549
Speaker 0: Okay, who's much younger than that guy?

365
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,429
Speaker 1: But see this is the cut.

366
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:06,650
Speaker 1: This is what I love about Japan that you can do this sort of thing and you can get away with it.

367
00:22:06,751 --> 00:22:08,909
Speaker 1: You can film it and you can put it on TV.

368
00:22:10,314 --> 00:22:21,570
Speaker 1: If that happened in America I think everyone involved would have been sued and at least a few people would be in jail right now Probably definitely lots of suing going on and there was no way it would get on TV or anything.

369
00:22:21,872 --> 00:22:23,300
Speaker 0: It really kind of sucks was?

370
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,506
Speaker 1: it doesn't seem like in America.

371
00:22:24,527 --> 00:22:29,188
Speaker 1: like in America You see a lot of ads for like prank videos and now you see him on YouTube a lot.

372
00:22:29,951 --> 00:22:35,648
Speaker 1: All the best pranks seem to come out of Europe South America specifically from Mexico in Japan.

373
00:22:35,709 --> 00:22:39,421
Speaker 0: However You know what else I saw today, you know a hobo fight.

374
00:22:40,164 --> 00:22:44,714
Speaker 0: Yeah bum fights you mean bum fights That's right, which was actually pretty horrible It is.

375
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:50,814
Speaker 0: but you know, I don't get I don't deny the guy the right to make it so Apparently he was on dr.

376
00:22:50,855 --> 00:22:51,738
Speaker 0: Phil, right?

377
00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:52,601
Speaker 0: So really?

378
00:22:52,641 --> 00:22:56,621
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I watched this clip where dr Phil has the guy on.

379
00:22:56,641 --> 00:23:02,818
Speaker 1: he says this is terrible But the guy who made it or the guy who fought in it like the main hobo What do you mean the main hobo?

380
00:23:02,898 --> 00:23:05,390
Speaker 1: There's one hobo that was kind of like the poster child of bum fights.

381
00:23:05,812 --> 00:23:09,890
Speaker 0: Oh, no, this is the guy the guy like the president the founder of bum fights.

382
00:23:10,512 --> 00:23:13,122
Speaker 1: Well that that's quite a life if your job title is.

383
00:23:13,242 --> 00:23:15,290
Speaker 1: I was the president and founder of bum fights.

384
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,461
Speaker 0: He seemed like actually a pretty smart guy.

385
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:20,046
Speaker 1: Well, cuz it's the same idea we had.

386
00:23:20,086 --> 00:23:21,270
Speaker 1: he just didn't take it far enough.

387
00:23:21,551 --> 00:23:26,969
Speaker 1: Yeah, the barge on international waters with the helicopter escape and the gladiatorial arena.

388
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:31,108
Speaker 0: Yep He just paid bums 20 bucks to pull their teeth out in video and we should do a show on that.

389
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:34,202
Speaker 1: We'll outline our idea and maybe someone will do it.

390
00:23:34,243 --> 00:23:35,770
Speaker 0: In fact, we could do that show right now.

391
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,667
Speaker 1: We could because that could be our first contest whoever does that?

392
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:55,965
Speaker 0: Anyway, so they dr Phil shows like you know this like he first he disparages the guy and then he shows like a video clip that Explains to everyone and shows them like what bum fights is and everything.

393
00:23:56,607 --> 00:24:02,566
Speaker 1: and then wait What if you don't know from the name of bum fights what bum fights is?

394
00:24:02,847 --> 00:24:09,146
Speaker 0: you've got issues Yeah, and then right the guy's sitting there and he's getting ready to talk and then dr.

395
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:11,300

396
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:15,120
Speaker 0: go away What yeah, basically like.

397
00:24:15,783 --> 00:24:25,230
Speaker 0: I was actually kind of pissed cuz while you know The bum fight guy is obviously taking advantage of bums, you know Which is not so good to make lots of money off of them and he gives them like 20 bucks.

398
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,604
Speaker 0: We should be giving them a lot more.

399
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,452
Speaker 0: Um Dr.

400
00:24:29,492 --> 00:24:32,989
Speaker 0: Phil was just kind of like yeah, I don't even want what it seemed like.

401
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:36,743
Speaker 0: Dr Phil didn't have an argument against the guy because the guy did seem smart.

402
00:24:36,763 --> 00:24:38,730
Speaker 0: He did seem like he was gonna successfully.

403
00:24:39,571 --> 00:24:41,097
Speaker 0: You know hold his own against dr.

404
00:24:41,137 --> 00:24:42,643

408
00:24:50,672 --> 00:24:55,659
Speaker 0: And then the guy the only words he gets in is you know What are you yelling at me for taking advantage of people?

409
00:24:55,719 --> 00:25:00,179
Speaker 0: all you do is drag people up on your TV show and show their Problems to the world taking advantage of them.

410
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,265
Speaker 0: and I was like hell.

415
00:25:09,045 --> 00:25:09,910
Speaker 0: I think he really not.

416
00:25:10,071 --> 00:25:11,909
Speaker 0: I think he saw himself in that guy.

417
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:18,070
Speaker 0: Well, they remind God got upset reminds me very much of the definitely plan to not talk to the guy in the first place.

425
00:25:28,691 --> 00:25:35,542
Speaker 0: But then when they actually found out the guy in charge was like semi intelligent They realized they couldn't argue with them.

426
00:25:35,562 --> 00:25:36,388
Speaker 0: So they said I got it.

427
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:40,444
Speaker 0: Well bring up on the show and then just tell him we don't want to talk and make security.

Speaker 1: We're all set to do this.

442
00:26:11,182 --> 00:26:12,246
Speaker 1: the much requested.

443
00:26:12,286 --> 00:26:13,230
Speaker 1: We were not all set.

444
00:26:13,431 --> 00:26:15,222
Speaker 1: I was no you I was all set.

445
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,309
Speaker 1: I could do the zombie show.

446
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:21,368
Speaker 1: Now anytime you come up to me and you ask me to do the next part of the zombie series.

447
00:26:21,469 --> 00:26:22,453
Speaker 1: I'm ready I can just do it.

448
00:26:22,493 --> 00:26:23,558
Speaker 0: No, you're just all talk.

449
00:26:23,638 --> 00:26:26,269
Speaker 0: You wouldn't be saying that if you actually had to do it.

450
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27,675
Speaker 1: But I'm all set to do it.

451
00:26:27,776 --> 00:26:29,343
Speaker 1: I know I was all set to do it.

452
00:26:29,383 --> 00:26:30,849
Speaker 1: In fact, I suggested we do it.

453
00:26:30,909 --> 00:26:34,126
Speaker 0: now Stop trying to like What's it called?

454
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:39,930
Speaker 0: Called white pander told listeners be like, you know trying to get them all for you and against me or whatever.

455
00:26:40,192 --> 00:26:41,849
Speaker 1: But I'm really ready to do the zombie show.

456
00:26:42,693 --> 00:26:45,887
Speaker 1: You think I can't talk for another 40 minutes about zombies.

457
00:26:46,168 --> 00:26:48,537
Speaker 0: on short I don't think you remember the stuff that we see.

458
00:26:48,557 --> 00:26:50,144
Speaker 0: the thing is the first show.

459
00:26:50,184 --> 00:26:51,830
Speaker 1: we talked about intelligence gathering.

460
00:26:52,132 --> 00:26:54,510
Speaker 0: There are things that we said in the first show like that.

461
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:58,510
Speaker 0: We're just specifically saying what we're gonna say in the second show and I forget what those things are.

462
00:26:58,831 --> 00:27:02,407
Speaker 1: No, we outlined different shows we would do in the future like the different segments.

463
00:27:02,427 --> 00:27:03,070
Speaker 1: We need to cover.

464
00:27:03,211 --> 00:27:06,284
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think we definitely need to listen the first show again before doing the second one.

465
00:27:06,445 --> 00:27:06,967
Speaker 0: Nah.

466
00:27:07,107 --> 00:27:09,129
Speaker 1: Yeah We don't listen to geek nights.

467
00:27:10,191 --> 00:27:11,555
Speaker 0: I do sometimes rarely.

468
00:27:11,575 --> 00:27:13,562
Speaker 1: I listen to it when we interview someone.

469
00:27:14,525 --> 00:27:17,283
Speaker 0: I didn't even listen to the most recent one I did on the way to work.

470
00:27:17,606 --> 00:27:22,524
Speaker 1: Okay Anyway, yeah, if you didn't listen to yesterday's geek nights last night.

471
00:27:22,544 --> 00:27:23,186
Speaker 1: It was pretty good.

472
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:24,310
Speaker 0: Yeah good show.

473
00:27:24,492 --> 00:27:26,268
Speaker 0: Yeah, well listen that one All right.

474
00:27:26,632 --> 00:27:30,250
Speaker 1: So I was gonna say well your options are and lay them out.

475
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:44,130
Speaker 1: But then I realized there isn't actually an audience here unless you count Kara Yamato Edward Alaric and Alan Shehzar Luigi and toad and Bato And Lupin and taiko sitting on my desk looking at me and foo foos down there.

476
00:27:44,532 --> 00:27:49,559
Speaker 0: Oh, no, and a puppy and fujiko You got too much shit on your desk.

477
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,366
Speaker 1: I got a lot of stuff on my desk.

478
00:27:51,808 --> 00:27:54,301
Speaker 0: Okay You want to talk about the barge?

479
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:56,108
Speaker 0: I guess.

480
00:27:58,036 --> 00:28:01,167
Speaker 1: Or do we just keep mentioning the barge and just keep talking?

481
00:28:01,248 --> 00:28:01,930
Speaker 1: keep talking?

482
00:28:02,435 --> 00:28:04,150
Speaker 1: Don't actually ever put it in the show.

483
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,990
Speaker 0: So let's do the barge because it'll be quick and I can go to bed sooner.

484
00:28:07,743 --> 00:28:08,089
Speaker 1: All right.

485
00:28:08,692 --> 00:28:18,450
Speaker 1: Now before we begin I would like to say that if you were curious as to whether or not we are serious about this idea You shouldn't need to ask that question and I'll leave it at that.

486
00:28:18,719 --> 00:28:20,615
Speaker 0: Yeah now we come up with.

487
00:28:20,795 --> 00:28:30,148
Speaker 0: we often come up with crazy and sometimes less crazy ideas for ways to Make money start businesses not have to go to work nine to five, etc, etc.

488
00:28:31,011 --> 00:28:31,874
Speaker 1: Yeah, now be it.

489
00:28:31,914 --> 00:28:39,410
Speaker 1: bear in mind that if we had enough capital to just do one of our not crazy ideas We'd probably be rich already, but that's how money works.

490
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,357
Speaker 1: If you have money, it's trivial to get more money.

491
00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:44,650
Speaker 1: If you don't have money not so easy to get more money.

492
00:28:44,871 --> 00:28:46,097
Speaker 0: No, not as easy.

493
00:28:46,137 --> 00:28:48,770
Speaker 1: Anyway, not without some form of trickery.

494
00:28:50,494 --> 00:28:57,499
Speaker 0: well, you can always go into debt to get a bunch of money and Hopefully if it works out you'll be able to pay it back.

495
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:06,008
Speaker 1: Yeah, but calculating that there's no way I can maintain my lifestyle If I borrowed that much money, nope, definitely not and I'm not gonna give up my lifestyle because it's pretty cool.

496
00:29:06,228 --> 00:29:12,148
Speaker 0: Yep So one of the crazy ideas that come up with over the years is the barge.

497
00:29:12,429 --> 00:29:24,870
Speaker 1: now The barge was spawned in great detail over the course of about four hours One night at RIT and then expounded upon over the next several weeks until the idea was solid.

498
00:29:25,551 --> 00:29:30,137
Speaker 0: basically what it comes down to is People like to see people fight.

499
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:34,277
Speaker 1: I mean this goes back to even like ancient Rome What do people like to do?

500
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,570
Speaker 1: like to see chariot races in the hippodrome?

501
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:43,079
Speaker 1: They like to fight with each other in the stands of the hippodrome and they like to watch gladiators Kill people and or animals.

502
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:51,270
Speaker 0: people like hockey people like football When a fight breaks out at baseball or basketball or anything like that where it's you know, not common people are all standing up.

503
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,802
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah now bear in mind thing is popular.

504
00:29:54,922 --> 00:30:00,686
Speaker 0: even pro wrestling where people pretend to fight It's very popular that we don't want to bring animals into this.

505
00:30:00,706 --> 00:30:01,530
Speaker 1: This is just people.

506
00:30:01,751 --> 00:30:04,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't want to see a guy versus a puppy.

507
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,906
Speaker 0: Well, I'd like to see a lion eat a guy.

508
00:30:06,926 --> 00:30:11,910
Speaker 1: I Only would like to see a fight with animals if the animal has an actual chance of winning.

509
00:30:12,392 --> 00:30:17,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll say this very a guy versus squirrel is not good, but a guy versus a monkey.

510
00:30:17,255 --> 00:30:19,433
Speaker 1: That's awesome if a bullfight had.

511
00:30:19,453 --> 00:30:26,799
Speaker 1: if whenever a bull gets a bullfighter in a bullfight like actually gets him I Cheer because those bulls are put through a lot.

512
00:30:26,819 --> 00:30:27,923
Speaker 1: That's really not worth it.

513
00:30:28,305 --> 00:30:29,590
Speaker 1: And those guys totally deserve it.

514
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:33,470
Speaker 0: That's my only problem with bullfighting is that it's not actually fighting the bull.

515
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:35,590
Speaker 0: It's just like the ceremony of killing a bull.

516
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,537
Speaker 0: It should be fucking fight the bull.

517
00:30:37,577 --> 00:30:41,834
Speaker 1: the bull can win and if the bull wins you give him however many lady bulls He wants.

518
00:30:41,874 --> 00:30:43,808
Speaker 1: you put him out to pasture for the rest of his life.

519
00:30:44,231 --> 00:30:46,320
Speaker 0: Well, no, he has to fight again to become the champion.

520
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:48,550
Speaker 1: Well once he's the champion you put him out to pasture.

521
00:30:49,656 --> 00:30:51,344
Speaker 0: Just one fight doesn't make you the champion.

522
00:30:51,384 --> 00:30:52,490
Speaker 0: All right, that's all I'm saying.

523
00:30:52,671 --> 00:30:59,688
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you can't make him fight - it doesn't matter if you're a person or a bull or a giant You know, you got to fight more than one fight to be the grand champ.

524
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:08,202
Speaker 0: So the idea of the barge step one acquire a barge.

525
00:31:08,382 --> 00:31:09,084
Speaker 0: see that.

526
00:31:09,245 --> 00:31:22,138
Speaker 1: remember that this idea is crazy Among the front row crew is fairly legendary And in fact people that we haven't talked to in a long time if we make contact with them again Well almost invariably bring up.

527
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,844
Speaker 1: So how's the barge coming?

528
00:31:24,828 --> 00:31:25,149
Speaker 0: I don't know.

529
00:31:25,189 --> 00:31:25,370
Speaker 0: is it?

530
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,875
Speaker 0: I don't remember anyone ever bringing that up.

531
00:31:26,996 --> 00:31:33,003
Speaker 1: I've been asked that in the last six months twice Wow Okay by people who are still in Rochester.

532
00:31:33,265 --> 00:31:34,230
Speaker 1: All right or in the Rochester.

533
00:31:34,431 --> 00:31:35,694
Speaker 0: So you get this barge.

534
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:39,545
Speaker 0: you put the barge in international waters where anything goes.

535
00:31:39,927 --> 00:31:42,353
Speaker 1: now before you put the barge Out there, you have to prepare it.

536
00:31:42,774 --> 00:31:43,256
Speaker 1: Basically.

537
00:31:43,637 --> 00:31:48,770
Speaker 1: We need a large arena area that has pretty much on the main deck of the barge.

538
00:31:49,812 --> 00:31:50,255
Speaker 1: It'll have.

539
00:31:50,437 --> 00:31:51,970
Speaker 1: you know, we could put obstacles in it or not.

540
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:52,331
Speaker 1: It'll be.

541
00:31:52,351 --> 00:31:53,455
Speaker 1: you know, we can customize it.

542
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:59,276
Speaker 1: but it's a big arena and there are low fences along the edges So it's not easy to fall out.

543
00:31:59,316 --> 00:32:02,167
Speaker 1: But yet you can throw someone over the edge if you want to.

544
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:02,729
Speaker 1: yeah.

545
00:32:03,775 --> 00:32:13,330
Speaker 1: Second to that we have a Very secure hold where we can barricade weapons and barricade people and ourselves in case things go awry.

546
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:22,803
Speaker 0: Yeah any combatants of any sort need to not be near each other before the actual time of fighting because they might try to poison each other or Something like that before the fight to guarantee victory.

547
00:32:22,823 --> 00:32:24,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can't have any of that.

548
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,459
Speaker 0: Everything's got to be you know up and up.

549
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,643
Speaker 1: more importantly.

550
00:32:27,924 --> 00:32:29,349
Speaker 1: They cannot be near us.

551
00:32:29,851 --> 00:32:39,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, I do not want a 700 pound man with the power to crush my skull with his pinky finger To be in the room next to me when I am holding the millions of dollars that he wants.

552
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,254
Speaker 0: So we'll have a special.

553
00:32:41,374 --> 00:32:48,266
Speaker 0: Oh, you didn't read that volume of death note yet style way to exchange money with these guys Without them being able to get us.

554
00:32:48,286 --> 00:32:49,813
Speaker 1: Yeah Congratulations.

555
00:32:49,853 --> 00:32:56,675
Speaker 1: You won go to the back to get your money kick sploosh Exactly So the next step.

556
00:32:57,257 --> 00:33:03,437
Speaker 1: we also need a Raised area which is basically where the if this were Roman times the Emperor would sit.

557
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:14,349
Speaker 1: replace the Emperor with myself Scott and maybe 10 people who have paid us a lot of money for the privilege of watching these fights live as opposed to over the fee and all on the all four sides.

558
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:22,750
Speaker 1: HDTV cameras and last and certainly not least a helipad with enough room for a helicopter.

559
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:33,886
Speaker 1: Yeah, two helicopters just in case and speed boats ready for us to escape should The worst come to worst meaning pretty much anything that can happen.

560
00:33:33,926 --> 00:33:34,067
Speaker 0: Yeah.

561
00:33:34,127 --> 00:33:35,614
Speaker 0: All right step two We got the barge.

562
00:33:35,634 --> 00:33:36,558
Speaker 0: We got the helicopters.

563
00:33:36,578 --> 00:33:37,422
Speaker 0: You got people on it.

564
00:33:37,503 --> 00:33:38,527
Speaker 0: We got everything set up.

565
00:33:39,271 --> 00:33:45,430
Speaker 0: Next we go and we find people who are sane and willing to fight to the death.

566
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:50,263
Speaker 0: Then we get them to sign contracts saying yes, I am sane.

567
00:33:50,644 --> 00:33:50,905
Speaker 0: Yes.

568
00:33:51,006 --> 00:33:52,110
Speaker 0: I am willing to fight to the death.

569
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:53,158
Speaker 1: I mean, we'll go straight up.

570
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,610
Speaker 1: We don't want to take advantage of people.

571
00:33:54,971 --> 00:33:59,610
Speaker 1: We will have psychologists on hand to evaluate people to make sure that they are of their right.

572
00:33:59,992 --> 00:34:00,736
Speaker 0: It's no fun.

573
00:34:00,816 --> 00:34:04,092
Speaker 0: If we get like some nutty bum who's like, yeah, I'll do it It's.

574
00:34:04,273 --> 00:34:11,909
Speaker 0: it's only cool if it's you know, someone who's like a serious fighter, you know Who's gonna you know actually fight and not just be kind of stupid.

575
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:22,310
Speaker 1: Yeah We don't know if they really want to do it and we don't want someone who's coerced into it like a mafia that forces a In to try to win money for him or like a single dad who's hard on his luck and really needs the money.

576
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:22,947
Speaker 1: We don't want that.

577
00:34:23,251 --> 00:34:32,050
Speaker 1: we want people with no family no friends who are badass and Willing to put their lives on the line for fame and fortune and actually enjoy this sort of thing.

578
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:35,605
Speaker 0: Yeah, we want like a like a bounty hunter who thinks he's so badass.

579
00:34:35,806 --> 00:34:40,982
Speaker 0: or we want like Like some kung fu master who thinks no one can take him like that.

580
00:34:41,203 --> 00:34:42,888
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

581
00:34:43,007 --> 00:34:43,730
Speaker 0: That's what we're looking for.

582
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:46,685
Speaker 1: Yeah The kind of people who if fight clubs were real would be in them.

583
00:34:46,705 --> 00:34:55,915
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm We got to get those people we got to get them to agree we bring them out to the barge we set up a little tournament and They fight to the death.

584
00:34:56,255 --> 00:35:01,594
Speaker 1: Yeah, or to you know when they go to surrender, I mean if you surrender then it's okay We'll protect you.

585
00:35:01,856 --> 00:35:03,122
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it'll be real.

586
00:35:03,223 --> 00:35:07,361
Speaker 0: fighting on video Which we will sell for lots of money on the internet.

587
00:35:07,763 --> 00:35:08,607
Speaker 1: now, they'll all be different.

588
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:09,492
Speaker 1: some of them Let's be.

589
00:35:09,572 --> 00:35:13,150
Speaker 1: they'll be you know, wearing loincloths and they'll fight in the old wrestling style.

590
00:35:13,551 --> 00:35:16,162
Speaker 1: Some of them, you know knives one of them will fry be.

591
00:35:16,222 --> 00:35:18,230
Speaker 1: bring whatever you can carry on to the barge.

592
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:19,509
Speaker 1: That isn't a gun.

593
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:23,790
Speaker 0: But we don't want any guns and no rockets because then they can get us see the rule.

594
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,535
Speaker 1: The first rule is no explosives.

595
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:26,678
Speaker 1: No guns.

596
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:28,122
Speaker 0: Yeah arrows are cool.

597
00:35:28,323 --> 00:35:30,248
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll have a little like Pope shields.

598
00:35:30,348 --> 00:35:30,910
Speaker 0: It'll be okay.

599
00:35:31,332 --> 00:35:32,236
Speaker 1: Yeah, because we.

600
00:35:32,316 --> 00:35:35,510
Speaker 1: not only do we not want to die, but we don't want our rich benefactors to die.

601
00:35:35,636 --> 00:35:40,490
Speaker 0: No Those rich benefactors who are paying a lot of money to sit on that barge and watch people fight to the death live.

602
00:35:40,751 --> 00:35:48,392
Speaker 1: See the other key aspect of this is the satellite uplink the live pay-per-view Broadcasts.

603
00:35:48,914 --> 00:35:49,456
Speaker 0: Oh great.

604
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:51,283
Speaker 1: That will be secure.

605
00:35:51,323 --> 00:35:53,230
Speaker 1: I mean it'll basically the way we would do it.

606
00:35:53,290 --> 00:36:05,619
Speaker 1: it would be broadcast all over the earth via satellites or Various may possibly illegal radio waves doesn't really matter how we do it and we'd encrypt it and you could pay us for a decryption key.

607
00:36:06,451 --> 00:36:10,344
Speaker 1: Hmm or another way we could do it is simply sell DVDs.

608
00:36:10,404 --> 00:36:12,090
Speaker 0: That's I was thinking we just sell DVDs.

609
00:36:13,511 --> 00:36:14,355
Speaker 0: That's the easiest way.

610
00:36:14,476 --> 00:36:14,878
Speaker 1: I don't know.

611
00:36:14,938 --> 00:36:17,310
Speaker 1: I think there's a certain appeal and people seeing it live.

612
00:36:17,993 --> 00:36:25,219
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course The biggest money would probably still come from very rich people who would pay to be Helicoptered out there to watch it live do whatever they want.

613
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:25,801
Speaker 0: Eventually.

614
00:36:25,821 --> 00:36:37,089
Speaker 0: It might need like a second barge with like a jumbotron Because There'll just be too many people who want to and then we'll charge like a billion dollars to sit on the barge with us.

615
00:36:38,011 --> 00:36:41,204
Speaker 1: I don't think we could charge a billion dollars charge a billion dollars for a billion dollars.

616
00:36:41,224 --> 00:36:46,230
Speaker 0: You could start your own barge Yeah, but you wouldn't have our bums on the bar.

617
00:36:47,973 --> 00:36:50,590
Speaker 1: See the key is we really have to get a lot of showmanship involved.

618
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:56,838
Speaker 1: I have to hire some experts in this field to you know, make sure that the drama is there The fights are good.

619
00:36:57,141 --> 00:36:58,170
Speaker 1: Make sure it doesn't drag.

620
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:01,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, we definitely have to build personalities around the guys who don't die.

621
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:04,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean we need people like the people in running man.

622
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,204
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a good one.

623
00:37:06,385 --> 00:37:09,858
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly like that Except unlike running man.

624
00:37:09,918 --> 00:37:10,963
Speaker 1: We won't be faking it.

625
00:37:11,325 --> 00:37:16,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, and unlike running man It won't be people who are perfectly innocent that we arrested and forced to be in running man.

626
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:20,690
Speaker 0: It'll be people who want to be in running man versus people who want to be in running man.

627
00:37:20,891 --> 00:37:24,203
Speaker 1: Yeah, I want the kind of people will come up and say oh, yeah fight to the death.

628
00:37:24,604 --> 00:37:24,825
Speaker 0: Yep.

629
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:26,090
Speaker 0: That's what we're looking for.

630
00:37:27,131 --> 00:37:28,275
Speaker 1: Now of course we.

631
00:37:28,316 --> 00:37:32,130
Speaker 1: there are numerous logistical concerns first and foremost pirates.

632
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:34,617
Speaker 1: International waters are a scary place.

633
00:37:34,698 --> 00:37:37,630
Speaker 0: So we're gonna have to hire Blackwater to guard our barge, which you know, what?

634
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:38,433
Speaker 1: Isn't that expensive?

635
00:37:38,574 --> 00:37:41,970
Speaker 0: No, not real not considering the money that we'd probably make by selling all those DVDs.

636
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:50,021
Speaker 1: And even if not Blackwater, I'm sure we can hire some security firm with a couple of small gunboats Maybe a small cruiser or something just to go around us.

637
00:37:50,061 --> 00:37:51,045
Speaker 1: Make sure no pirates come.

638
00:37:51,065 --> 00:37:53,546
Speaker 0: Alright problem number two Navies.

639
00:37:54,377 --> 00:38:01,090
Speaker 1: Well, I can't imagine I mean what Navy is going to spend its resources to go out to the middle of the Atlantic Ocean?

640
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:07,270
Speaker 1: well, probably the Pacific Ocean, yeah and Stop us from having a bunch of dumb guys fight to the death.

641
00:38:07,391 --> 00:38:14,529
Speaker 0: But if someone is really pissed at us for what we were doing They might send a Navy or a Coast Guard out to bother us.

642
00:38:14,871 --> 00:38:23,455
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is a lot of the countries I could see coming to bother us would probably rather ignore us or possibly sell our Thing to their people.

643
00:38:23,716 --> 00:38:26,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, some countries would but like if we got too close to the u.s.

644
00:38:27,151 --> 00:38:41,502
Speaker 0: Even if you're technically in international waters I don't think that they would have a problem like, you know plus the people a lot of people in the u.s And protest and try to get them to do this to send like a Coast Guard boat to shoot at us or something To make us move or you know, try to fuck us up.

645
00:38:42,004 --> 00:38:48,050
Speaker 0: Yeah now there are ways around that I mean we could do it in Antarctica and it would be awesome because they would be freezing cold.

646
00:38:49,592 --> 00:38:57,644
Speaker 1: No, it would just be two guys in like triple fat goose Coats with hell hats and mittens on kind of padding at each other for an hour.

647
00:38:57,884 --> 00:38:59,389
Speaker 0: I'll be the best we got to do that.

648
00:39:00,211 --> 00:39:03,560
Speaker 0: It's only in Antarctica the barge nice barge.

649
00:39:03,601 --> 00:39:04,563
Speaker 1: That'd be a decent fight.

650
00:39:04,764 --> 00:39:05,506
Speaker 1: We have one fight.

651
00:39:05,526 --> 00:39:06,810
Speaker 0: We're padding each other.

652
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:11,370
Speaker 0: Well, it's like you could take the clothes off, but will you freeze before you kill the other guy?

653
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:17,458
Speaker 1: Yeah, and even if you take yours off how you get a punch through his padding Can't even snap his neck and no knives or anything.

654
00:39:17,959 --> 00:39:18,701
Speaker 1: No knives.

655
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:20,767
Speaker 0: Maybe I think it might come down to teeth.

656
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:26,050
Speaker 0: I Don't know, you know if I was in that fight, I would grow my nails out and get him like doubly thick.

657
00:39:27,192 --> 00:39:28,617
Speaker 1: How are you gonna get your nails doubly thick?

658
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:29,781
Speaker 0: I don't know.

659
00:39:30,143 --> 00:39:32,070
Speaker 0: There's got to be ways to make your nails thicker.

660
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's diseases that do it.

661
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,163
Speaker 0: There you go.

662
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:37,078
Speaker 1: I Think the best way to win that fight is to cheat.

663
00:39:37,781 --> 00:39:37,982
Speaker 0: Mmm.

664
00:39:38,022 --> 00:39:38,644
Speaker 0: How would you cheat?

665
00:39:38,926 --> 00:39:39,508
Speaker 0: sneak a knife in?

666
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,502
Speaker 1: Sneak a stiletto in with poison on the tip.

667
00:39:42,743 --> 00:39:44,189
Speaker 1: Whoo or syringe?

668
00:39:44,991 --> 00:39:46,830
Speaker 0: Hey, you know what though, you know a good way to cheat.

669
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:50,445
Speaker 0: It's like having a poison tooth like a tooth where like it's a fake tooth.

670
00:39:50,525 --> 00:39:51,630
Speaker 0: It breaks poison comes out.

671
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:52,495
Speaker 0: Just bite the other guy.

672
00:39:52,837 --> 00:39:55,049
Speaker 1: Uh, you'd probably poison yourself.

673
00:39:56,011 --> 00:40:01,970
Speaker 0: No, cuz the tooth would pop out of your mouth after you bit the guy and stay in the other guy You have to bite through the padding.

674
00:40:02,472 --> 00:40:04,722
Speaker 0: Well, you could bite him in like the nose or the face.

675
00:40:04,983 --> 00:40:05,987
Speaker 1: the face will be covered.

676
00:40:06,007 --> 00:40:06,871
Speaker 0: the house He can.

677
00:40:06,891 --> 00:40:09,924
Speaker 1: they see the ski mask ski goggles.

678
00:40:10,105 --> 00:40:12,801
Speaker 1: Oh you could get that off Yeah, but then he got yours off.

679
00:40:12,841 --> 00:40:13,767
Speaker 1: then he pokes you in the eye.

680
00:40:15,131 --> 00:40:16,075
Speaker 0: I'd poke him in here.

681
00:40:16,095 --> 00:40:18,184
Speaker 1: He poked you in the eye first while you were trying to bite him.

682
00:40:18,204 --> 00:40:20,554
Speaker 0: I don't know It doesn't matter.

683
00:40:20,595 --> 00:40:22,060
Speaker 0: This is why we're not the fighters.

684
00:40:22,141 --> 00:40:24,430
Speaker 0: We are the fight through the Don Kings if you will.

685
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,093
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, we're the.

686
00:40:25,113 --> 00:40:27,123
Speaker 1: we're the corrupt emperors exactly.

687
00:40:27,163 --> 00:40:33,585
Speaker 1: but in terms of Navy's and all that We really have to I mean any Navy that came after us international waters.

688
00:40:33,846 --> 00:40:35,210
Speaker 1: Hopefully we could appeal to the UN.

689
00:40:36,931 --> 00:40:41,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, the UN's really gonna protect some guys who are having fights to the death on their barge.

690
00:40:41,571 --> 00:40:42,918
Speaker 0: Well, you see the thing is they should.

691
00:40:42,958 --> 00:40:47,316
Speaker 1: cuz international waters you can do whatever you want out there Even fight to the death.

692
00:40:47,738 --> 00:40:50,409
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean you everyone saw that episode of the Simpsons.

693
00:40:52,011 --> 00:41:00,450
Speaker 0: Going to broadcast major league baseball games with only Oral consent is not express written consent.

694
00:41:01,591 --> 00:41:12,006
Speaker 1: So aside from the political issue of Navy's which we have some solutions for But it would really depend on what we I mean, maybe we could make a deal with like North Korea.

695
00:41:12,026 --> 00:41:15,456
Speaker 1: Just make it with Sealand Sealands not so powerful.

696
00:41:15,476 --> 00:41:16,441
Speaker 1: They don't have so much of a navy.

697
00:41:16,461 --> 00:41:17,346
Speaker 1: They've got like one boat.

698
00:41:17,386 --> 00:41:18,130
Speaker 0: They have a helicopter.

699
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:24,010
Speaker 1: If anything we get some country to back us or at least to provide protection.

700
00:41:26,102 --> 00:41:32,484
Speaker 1: Or Maybe we get letters of mark And then we become pirates and forget the barge all together the barges that see.

701
00:41:32,765 --> 00:41:33,749
Speaker 1: this is the beauty the idea one.

702
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:37,544
Speaker 1: We have the illegal fights, which is the first time we do that.

703
00:41:37,564 --> 00:41:40,745
Speaker 1: They're not illegal if they're international waters Well, they're illegal in all the countries of origin.

704
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:43,238
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah But we do them in the first time.

705
00:41:43,298 --> 00:41:46,050
Speaker 1: people probably wouldn't realize where we were what we were doing if that was too late.

706
00:41:46,411 --> 00:41:48,280
Speaker 1: By the time the Navy gets there the fights are over.

707
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,364
Speaker 1: The barge is empty.

708
00:41:49,626 --> 00:41:50,570
Speaker 1: We've left with our money.

709
00:41:50,971 --> 00:41:55,370
Speaker 1: We need to buy new parts the next year, even if we didn't want to bother with the fights at all.

710
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:56,294
Speaker 1: It was a total scam.

711
00:41:56,937 --> 00:41:58,102
Speaker 1: once the rich people show up.

712
00:41:58,785 --> 00:42:02,682
Speaker 1: We just hold him hostage Take their money.

713
00:42:02,702 --> 00:42:04,675
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah It's actually all a trick.

714
00:42:04,795 --> 00:42:09,210
Speaker 0: all those guys that they thought were gonna fight each other to the death are actually just really strong guys.

715
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,738
Speaker 0: So we're gonna hold these rich people hostage.

716
00:42:11,059 --> 00:42:13,150
Speaker 1: or better the rich people have to fight their way out.

717
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:18,328
Speaker 1: They either have to buy or fight their way off the barge just like the second chapter of Shadowrun for the SNES.

718
00:42:19,459 --> 00:42:23,920
Speaker 1: It's sort of like You can fight the arena or you can give me a bunch of money.

719
00:42:24,101 --> 00:42:26,489
Speaker 0: No, no, no the the what?

720
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:28,468
Speaker 0: What the most dangerous game?

721
00:42:30,591 --> 00:42:32,398
Speaker 1: I remember reading that in like.

722
00:42:32,499 --> 00:42:35,530
Speaker 0: I think I read that in middle school in high school like three times.

723
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:38,118
Speaker 1: I read it was assigned in three different classes in high school.

724
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:40,525
Speaker 1: And then it was assigned again in college.

725
00:42:40,545 --> 00:42:41,970
Speaker 0: It was assigned in college.

726
00:42:42,191 --> 00:42:46,206
Speaker 1: Yeah in that bullshit writing in lit class that they make everyone at RIT take no matter what.

727
00:42:46,246 --> 00:42:46,587
Speaker 0: Oh, wow.

728
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:47,290
Speaker 0: Was it a sign?

729
00:42:47,751 --> 00:42:48,634
Speaker 1: It wasn't.

730
00:42:48,674 --> 00:42:50,038
Speaker 1: yeah, I didn't read it.

731
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:52,466
Speaker 0: cuz middle school high school college.

732
00:42:52,506 --> 00:42:53,730
Speaker 0: what the fuck is up with that story?

733
00:42:53,831 --> 00:42:55,889
Speaker 0: The teachers must just freakin love that thing.

734
00:42:55,990 --> 00:43:07,889
Speaker 1: well, the the lesson that was used for in two of the three instances where I had to read it was kind of this real literature versus escapist literature or something to that effect and they were like is this escapist or not?

735
00:43:08,049 --> 00:43:14,487
Speaker 1: and The answer always given was yes, it's escapist because the end isn't actually in any way profound.

736
00:43:14,588 --> 00:43:15,230
Speaker 1: It's just a twist.

737
00:43:17,731 --> 00:43:22,810
Speaker 1: The argument was much greater than that and I didn't really care because I don't care either.

738
00:43:24,151 --> 00:43:28,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, is anyone out there read most dangerous game or been assigned most dangerous game in a class?

739
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:31,962
Speaker 1: Yeah with the repass for the hounds at the end and such.

740
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:34,473
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was the most comfortable bed He'd ever slept in.

741
00:43:34,513 --> 00:43:40,702
Speaker 0: that's where I learned about the that trap where the we got a tree and it swings down and then Smashes you together with the other tree.

742
00:43:40,722 --> 00:43:44,350
Speaker 0: Ah What's that trap called where the two trees come down on the road?

743
00:43:45,094 --> 00:43:46,924
Speaker 1: Called but I learned about it from that book as well.

744
00:43:47,045 --> 00:43:47,266
Speaker 1: Yep.

745
00:43:47,387 --> 00:43:51,602
Speaker 1: Okay Yes, anyway, so see now we've got bulk.

746
00:43:51,643 --> 00:43:53,810
Speaker 1: Not only can we I mean say we have the fights anyway.

747
00:43:54,192 --> 00:44:02,409
Speaker 1: so now we make the money from the fights we make the money from the ransoms and maybe we just kill those people anywhere make them fight and then we sell the special edition of.

748
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:07,229
Speaker 1: Here's Bill Gates having to fight this this dude to the death.

749
00:44:08,056 --> 00:44:11,198
Speaker 0: Yeah Here's Bill Gates getting eaten by a lion.

750
00:44:11,379 --> 00:44:16,615
Speaker 0: or people really wanted to see what's-his-face get hit by killed by a stingray Even though it wasn't real.

751
00:44:16,635 --> 00:44:26,029
Speaker 1: Well, I mean it was real but even though it wasn't on purpose like, you know Well, there was that one video that was that wasn't it but it was fake and it was obviously fake after you watch it.

752
00:44:26,571 --> 00:44:29,829
Speaker 1: But so many people clicked on it on YouTube because they thought it was the real thing.

753
00:44:30,222 --> 00:44:35,689
Speaker 0: Yeah So imagine if we actually have like a video like here's a dude being eaten by a lion for real

754
00:44:35,849 --> 00:44:37,789
Speaker 1: plus Imagine if Bill Gates wins

755
00:44:39,271 --> 00:44:39,973
Speaker 0: Man,

756
00:44:39,993 --> 00:44:44,690
Speaker 1: oh that not only would that was that DVD sell for so much money

757
00:44:45,151 --> 00:44:50,790
Speaker 0: Why there was just a video the other day of like an alligator eating some dude's arm that I saw and that was all Over you too.

758
00:44:50,991 --> 00:44:58,033
Speaker 1: I was more impressed with the video of the guy who set his pants on fire and then screamed about it and why he did It to himself.

759
00:44:58,094 --> 00:44:58,696
Speaker 0: That's different.

760
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:00,883
Speaker 1: Yeah, but people still want to see that stuff.

761
00:45:01,044 --> 00:45:01,927
Speaker 0: They do they do.

762
00:45:01,987 --> 00:45:02,810
Speaker 0: it gets a lot of visits.

763
00:45:03,011 --> 00:45:08,988
Speaker 1: Now the other concern and this is an important one is how to protect ourselves from the very dangerous people that are all over this barge.

764
00:45:09,615 --> 00:45:14,275
Speaker 0: The answer is that why I have four words Guns, lots of guns.

765
00:45:14,416 --> 00:45:14,977
Speaker 0: you see one.

766
00:45:14,997 --> 00:45:27,327
Speaker 1: We're in this raised platform with some sort of mesh screen or maybe a Pope shield to yield Mounted right there and probably mounted on the other side of the boat as well would be probably Vulcan cannon.

767
00:45:27,908 --> 00:45:30,443
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah That's that's way too much.

768
00:45:30,524 --> 00:45:35,785
Speaker 1: But oh, yeah I learned from advanced wars the point of Vulcan cannon at a human being.

769
00:45:35,805 --> 00:45:36,809
Speaker 1: that's the end.

770
00:45:37,532 --> 00:45:38,075
Speaker 0: There's nothing.

771
00:45:38,558 --> 00:45:40,850
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't care how many infantry you have one Vulcan.

772
00:45:41,933 --> 00:45:42,620
Speaker 0: This turns you all.

773
00:45:42,641 --> 00:45:43,449
Speaker 0: it's like pudding.

774
00:45:44,651 --> 00:45:46,942
Speaker 1: Well, unless they have mechs, but we don't need to worry about mechs.

775
00:45:47,163 --> 00:45:48,690
Speaker 0: No, I don't think they're gonna bring mechs.

776
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:50,949
Speaker 1: They're not gonna bring if a guy shows up.

777
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:54,483
Speaker 0: No The fucking can probably work against navies too because they don't expect us to have that.

778
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:56,130
Speaker 0: and like they'll send up a little Navy boat.

779
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,081
Speaker 1: But no, they'll send up a Coast Guard speedboat.

780
00:45:58,101 --> 00:45:59,188
Speaker 1: Like what are you guys up to?

781
00:46:00,495 --> 00:46:01,288
Speaker 0: Turn it into dust.

782
00:46:02,332 --> 00:46:03,539
Speaker 1: Well, you know what they'll probably?

783
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:04,142
Speaker 0: I don't know.

784
00:46:04,182 --> 00:46:05,410
Speaker 0: I don't know if I'd shoot at the coast guy.

785
00:46:05,551 --> 00:46:07,528
Speaker 1: You mean they'll probably listen to reason.

786
00:46:13,278 --> 00:46:13,928
Speaker 0: A funny joke.

787
00:46:15,131 --> 00:46:17,298
Speaker 0: No, they'll listen to money also in bribes.

788
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:18,622
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right.

789
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:20,909
Speaker 1: We can bribe people cuz we'll have all this money.

790
00:46:21,332 --> 00:46:24,029
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yeah, they'll also listen to reason.

791
00:46:24,913 --> 00:46:30,130
Speaker 1: But yeah crowd control is key cuz we don't want any trouble no other than the trouble that we're expecting

792
00:46:30,914 --> 00:46:33,969
Speaker 0: The on-purpose trouble not the accident trouble, of

793
00:46:33,989 --> 00:46:41,625
Speaker 1: course There's also the issue of how do we go back home after it's over because there's probably gonna be Some sort of warrant for our arrest in America.

794
00:46:41,645 --> 00:46:42,410
Speaker 0: live on the barge.

795
00:46:43,032 --> 00:46:46,789
Speaker 1: Well either that or we don't actually reveal who we are.

796
00:46:48,198 --> 00:46:54,090
Speaker 1: We wear those cool We dressed like in black shrouds and we wear those cool masks with the long hook noses.

797
00:46:54,512 --> 00:46:58,110
Speaker 0: Well now that we've made this podcast where they think the idea is shot then, isn't it?

798
00:46:59,311 --> 00:47:04,479
Speaker 1: It could conceivably be two other guys Will be like the blue man group.

799
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:09,880
Speaker 1: So one day it's me and Scott one day It's Alex and one of our listeners one day.

800
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,285
Speaker 1: It's my mom and Scott's mom.

801
00:47:11,305 --> 00:47:12,209
Speaker 1: You don't know who's doing it.

802
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:19,500
Speaker 0: Somehow I think that if it happened and then someone found this podcast Describing exactly the thing that's happening.

803
00:47:19,982 --> 00:47:20,805
Speaker 0: They would know it was us.

804
00:47:21,488 --> 00:47:27,170
Speaker 0: hence And when they come to look for us and we're not there and they notice that we've left the country.

805
00:47:28,233 --> 00:47:38,266
Speaker 1: Yeah, well one stunt doubles To in the light in the spirit of the second most recent Perry Bible Fellowship entitled Robin Hood.
