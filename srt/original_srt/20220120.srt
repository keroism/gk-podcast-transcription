1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,435
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, January 20th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,435 --> 00:00:09,696
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,935 --> 00:00:14,490
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:15,857
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,877 --> 00:00:18,109
Speaker 1: Tonight we are talking about greeting cards.

6
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:20,307
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:21,711 --> 00:00:25,110
Speaker 1: So I am continuing my odyssey and I've turned this into an actual challenge.

8
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,289
Speaker 1: My goal now, like what am I just low-key goals in my life?

9
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:32,570
Speaker 1: Lower priority than Genji because I'm rapidly approaching the finish line.

10
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,519
Speaker 1: I don't think Genji's got much longer to live.

11
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:36,490
Speaker 1: He's uh, anyway.

12
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,318
Speaker 1: So, uh, I'm trying now.

13
00:00:40,438 --> 00:00:49,250
Speaker 1: My goal is to beat every single song in DDR on every difficulty, nine feet or under, not like max 300 legend of max.

14
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,030
Speaker 1: Like, cause that did, that shit didn't even exist until like six.

15
00:00:52,310 --> 00:01:00,730
Speaker 0: So basically you said a line, you said, this is the difficulty of DDR song that I'm capable of beating and I'm going to beat every song that's that level or easier.

16
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,970
Speaker 1: So it's a little more than that because.

17
00:01:03,832 --> 00:01:05,750
Speaker 0: That's like saying I can lift a hundred pounds.

18
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,590
Speaker 0: I'm going to lift every rock on earth that weighs less than a hundred.

19
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,710
Speaker 1: Actually, you know why I picked?

20
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,910
Speaker 1: I actually did not pick that line for that reason because as of now, there are several songs I cannot pass following my rule.

21
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,110
Speaker 0: And you set the bar a little bit higher to level up.

22
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:27,130
Speaker 1: And in fact, uh, before recently, most of the songs that I've passed in this challenge, I passed for the first time in the last two or three weeks.

23
00:01:27,231 --> 00:01:30,090
Speaker 1: And it was never able to pass in my life up till this point.

24
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,470
Speaker 0: Is that because you had never done them before in your life?

25
00:01:32,632 --> 00:01:33,949
Speaker 1: Some of them I'd never done before.

26
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,350
Speaker 1: Some of them I had tried to do.

27
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:39,550
Speaker 0: I could do a song on basic and be like, wow, I've never been able to beat that before.

28
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,229
Speaker 1: Oh, no, I'm only talking about nine footers.

29
00:01:41,391 --> 00:01:45,028
Speaker 1: Most of the nine footers I have passed in my life, I have passed for the first time in the last month.

30
00:01:45,614 --> 00:01:46,689
Speaker 1: The majority of them, in fact.

31
00:01:48,511 --> 00:02:00,510
Speaker 1: But the reason I chose nine feet is actually a reason you would appreciate, uh, up until eighth mix DDR dance, dance revolution for you kids who've never heard of this, has a foot rating from one to nine.

32
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,190
Speaker 1: And nine was the maximum difficulty.

33
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:11,550
Speaker 1: Like when we were playing DDR at RIT, Scott and I got to the point we could do seven footers like reliably, like, like no chance of failure.

34
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:12,409
Speaker 1: That's like music.

35
00:02:12,713 --> 00:02:12,834
Speaker 1: Like.

36
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,008
Speaker 1: that's about the level we were at.

37
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,207
Speaker 1: Eight footers were the hard songs and nine footers were like the Orion dot 78 bullshit.

38
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:24,569
Speaker 1: I could barely pass most nine footers that I could even pass back then.

39
00:02:25,052 --> 00:02:32,009
Speaker 1: But I picked nine feet because that was the maximum difficulty of DDR until max 300 appeared in six mix.

40
00:02:32,434 --> 00:02:33,629
Speaker 1: That was the first 10 footer.

41
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:38,530
Speaker 1: And up until eighth mix, there were only a few 10 footers and 10 footer basically just men.

42
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:40,870
Speaker 1: These are the weird, special bullshit songs.

43
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:51,630
Speaker 0: I mean, I always enjoyed that those existed, but I like, I didn't play DDR to play the, you know, I just never interested in like, you know, raising the difficulty level.

44
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,178
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, I never wanted, it was always like a sticker ad.

45
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:03,750
Speaker 0: If I saw other people trying it, you know, it's like, I played songs and it's like, okay, this song doesn't have enough arrows to even be interesting.

46
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,230
Speaker 0: I'm like going step step, right?

47
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,247
Speaker 1: And then it's silent Hill, the Christmas song basic.

48
00:03:09,252 --> 00:03:12,790
Speaker 0: And I guess, you know, judging by the fourth mix measurement, right?

49
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:20,630
Speaker 0: The harder trick, easier maniac songs, like a six, seven foot, six, seven, eight is like the sweet spot of like super fun.

50
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,710
Speaker 0: Sweet spot where there's enough arrows that it's interesting.

51
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:28,990
Speaker 0: It's still challenging, but you're, you're can still dance.

52
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,088
Speaker 0: You're not just sort of like, right.

53
00:03:31,574 --> 00:03:31,846
Speaker 0: You know?

54
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:39,930
Speaker 0: And it's, you know, it's like, yeah, there were some harder ones that I could do, you know, but it's like, I just, it wasn't fun to do those.

55
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:46,630
Speaker 0: Cause it became a, you know, not only was it harder, but it was actually a different game at that level, right?

56
00:03:46,732 --> 00:03:47,569
Speaker 0: It wasn't the same.

57
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:51,490
Speaker 0: You know, it's like, no longer is it about right.

58
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,950
Speaker 0: It's about something different.

59
00:03:53,512 --> 00:03:54,770
Speaker 0: You know, it's not just like straight.

60
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,890
Speaker 1: We would get like that's the seven footer, the same game, just harder.

61
00:03:58,596 --> 00:03:58,807
Speaker 0: Yeah.

62
00:03:59,071 --> 00:04:03,072
Speaker 1: Like most of how we played DDR was, Hey, let's do this song and have fun and try to show off.

63
00:04:03,132 --> 00:04:05,950
Speaker 1: and Hey, I'm going to try to do a spin like that kind of nonsense.

64
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:15,250
Speaker 1: But so as of now, I have passed every song on DDR on every difficulty through up to eight feet all the way through the end of seventh mix.

65
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,326
Speaker 1: And I'm halfway through eighth mix.

66
00:04:17,451 --> 00:04:26,487
Speaker 1: Uh, nine feet, uh, I have two nine footers to go in six mix and I currently can not pass either of them.

67
00:04:27,411 --> 00:04:29,290
Speaker 1: Uh, one of them I'm real close to passing.

68
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,570
Speaker 1: It's one of the weird orions.

69
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,249
Speaker 1: Like if I try it one more time, I'll pass it.

70
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:37,930
Speaker 1: But flash in the night, the fuck that song is weirdly hard for a nine footer.

71
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,248
Speaker 1: Like compared to any other nine footer I've ever seen.

72
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:41,869
Speaker 0: I haven't heard of that one.

73
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:43,130
Speaker 1: It's a six mix song.

74
00:04:43,772 --> 00:04:48,486
Speaker 1: You probably only ever saw it at, uh, remember there was a six mix machine at the bowling alley.

75
00:04:49,151 --> 00:04:52,488
Speaker 0: I played six mix a few times because I was the machine, the head of the bowling alley.

76
00:04:54,331 --> 00:05:00,110
Speaker 1: But, uh, the things, I guess the things I've noticed is I have added some techniques now to my repertoire that I never did before.

77
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:07,109
Speaker 1: Like rocking a foot between heel and toad and Nintendo foot because 40 year old rim cannot mash his foot that fast.

78
00:05:07,596 --> 00:05:08,249
Speaker 1: Like directly.

79
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,029
Speaker 0: I got, I wasn't a fan of arrows that made me do that.

80
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:17,987
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I also noticed that I can do seven footers without dancing adjacent, but it's that kind of stuff.

81
00:05:18,832 --> 00:05:22,530
Speaker 1: But, uh, yeah, this is actually a super fun thing that's pretty low effort.

82
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:32,430
Speaker 1: And my goal is just to be able to pass every song that existed in the ecosystem of DDR that existed up until like after eighth mix.

83
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,610
Speaker 1: Like when we really weren't paying attention to DDR anymore.

84
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:41,570
Speaker 0: Well, I'm spending my time doing a lot of reading because it's cold outside and I don't have to read the tale again anymore.

85
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:45,429
Speaker 0: So I read and I'm reading all kinds of stuff and I'm reading it way faster.

86
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,564
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, yes, reading words.

87
00:05:50,432 --> 00:05:54,189
Speaker 1: Well, it's not because it's the words were written in the past few decades.

88
00:05:55,491 --> 00:06:02,670
Speaker 1: There's it's like the difference between when we read Emily Wilson's translation of the Odyssey versus the last time before that that I read the Odyssey.

89
00:06:03,173 --> 00:06:03,836
Speaker 1: It is the actual.

90
00:06:03,877 --> 00:06:05,949
Speaker 0: how to say it is difficult to read.

91
00:06:06,251 --> 00:06:08,470
Speaker 0: Well, not the actual Odyssey in Greek.

92
00:06:09,092 --> 00:06:09,273
Speaker 0: No,

93
00:06:09,734 --> 00:06:11,661
Speaker 1: I mean, I know some translation

94
00:06:11,762 --> 00:06:11,862
Speaker 0: who

95
00:06:11,882 --> 00:06:22,230
Speaker 1: have read that thing in Greek and I know a guy at work who can recite it in Greek because that's a thing that a lot of people in the UK just do as part of college is learn enough ancient Greek to read the classics.

96
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:26,229
Speaker 1: So there's a guy at work who literally can recite the Odyssey in Greek, mostly from memory.

97
00:06:27,231 --> 00:06:27,769
Speaker 0: Uh huh.

98
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,850
Speaker 1: He's still like, pull this out and just do it at a party.

99
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,048
Speaker 1: Like I've seen him do it.

100
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,067
Speaker 0: That's that guy.

101
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,450
Speaker 1: I know that's the Odyssey guy.

102
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:51,029
Speaker 1: Hey, that's like two steps above the person who you see very, like, very ostentatiously like making the mouth movements of the soliloquies when they're watching Shakespeare to make sure everyone around them knows that they memorized it.

103
00:06:51,713 --> 00:06:52,067
Speaker 0: That's you.

104
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:53,629
Speaker 1: That is not me.

105
00:06:54,473 --> 00:06:57,450
Speaker 1: I know I know two soliloquies from Shakespeare still.

106
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,750
Speaker 0: That's two more than anyone who's not that guy knows.

107
00:07:00,971 --> 00:07:06,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's just because I played those parts in high school in like dump ass productions of Hamlet and Macbeth.

108
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:12,670
Speaker 0: You were in dump had more dump ass productions than anyone who's not that guy.

109
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,590
Speaker 1: That was that you realized that was required in AP English.

110
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,107
Speaker 1: You had to perform in the in the Shakespeare stuff.

111
00:07:19,261 --> 00:07:19,345
Speaker 0: Okay.

112
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:20,387
Speaker 1: Unless you got a note.

113
00:07:22,332 --> 00:07:24,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, I played, I played, I played Laertes once.

114
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,180
Speaker 1: I played, I did.

115
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:31,090
Speaker 1: I get to get to get to be actual Macbeth once, which was annoying.

116
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,549
Speaker 1: Anyway, got any news?

117
00:07:35,712 --> 00:07:36,780
Speaker 0: Uh, do we have?

118
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:37,930
Speaker 1: I got a bunch of news.

119
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:39,729
Speaker 1: Did you not actually come up with the news?

120
00:07:40,211 --> 00:07:41,349
Speaker 1: Do I have to go through all mine in a row?

121
00:07:42,072 --> 00:07:42,699
Speaker 0: Is there anything?

122
00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:43,730
Speaker 1: I don't think you sent me a link?

123
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:44,705
Speaker 1: I don't think you had a news.

124
00:07:45,737 --> 00:07:46,390
Speaker 0: I think I forgot.

125
00:07:47,953 --> 00:07:49,429
Speaker 1: I ain't stopping the show is about.

126
00:07:50,332 --> 00:07:51,589
Speaker 0: Let's go see what's what's going on.

127
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,249
Speaker 1: Cause I got it.

128
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,149
Speaker 1: I'll start with a few.

129
00:07:53,250 --> 00:08:03,949
Speaker 1: So, uh, this is, this is something that is important, but it's also not something that is like as scientific as some people make it out to be.

130
00:08:04,473 --> 00:08:06,729
Speaker 1: But it's something that I think people should pay attention to.

131
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:15,679
Speaker 1: Partly because I started to realize just talking about this and poking at it recently because it made the news again, that a lot of younger people sort of lost the context for what this is.

132
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:18,349
Speaker 1: The thing I'm talking about is the doomsday clock.

133
00:08:19,171 --> 00:08:25,128
Speaker 1: The doomsday clock has existed for a long time and it actually was invented and publicized during the cold war.

134
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:37,197
Speaker 1: The goal of it, uh, was to have a, a pseudo objective, but mostly qualitative measure, agreed upon by a body of experts.

135
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:49,010
Speaker 1: that is roughly just an analogy or a arbitrary metric, like a baseline to say, how close is humanity to destroying itself by its own hands?

136
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,609
Speaker 1: Like, are we close to doing this?

137
00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:53,729
Speaker 1: Have we backed away from doing this?

138
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:58,930
Speaker 1: Like what's a relative measure of the danger of humans to themselves on a global scale?

139
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,126
Speaker 1: Like that's the intent of it.

140
00:09:01,031 --> 00:09:08,988
Speaker 1: And it really existed to highlight the fact that nuclear weapons for the second time in human history, cause I have a point to make here.

141
00:09:09,832 --> 00:09:17,708
Speaker 1: Where, where there was a second time humans made something that we could theoretically destroy our entire society with if we chose to.

142
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:24,288
Speaker 1: I say second time because fossil fuel and the way we use cars is the first time.

143
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,569
Speaker 1: we just didn't recognize the danger of that at the time.

144
00:09:28,491 --> 00:09:30,450
Speaker 0: And no one recognizes the slow roll.

145
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:31,026
Speaker 1: Yeah.

146
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:41,749
Speaker 1: Like nuclear weapons, uh, the doomsday clock was cool, was less close to destruction of during at any point in the cold war than it is now.

147
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:49,310
Speaker 1: And it is where it is now primarily due to climate change and the global rise of fascism and the dysfunction of global governments.

148
00:09:51,170 --> 00:10:10,486
Speaker 1: We are so among experts who's basically entire professional identities are around thinking about existential crises to humanity from our own hands have agreed pretty much unilaterally that climate change is a bigger risk to humans than nuclear weapons ever were at any point and likely ever will be.

149
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,950
Speaker 0: That is obvious to people, but also nuclear weapons are still a threat.

150
00:10:17,694 --> 00:10:25,350
Speaker 1: Nuclear weapons are not less of a threat, but we are closer to crisis due to climate change than we are due to nuclear weapons.

151
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:29,530
Speaker 0: In fact, there could be many, you know, uh, combinations of the two, right?

152
00:10:29,651 --> 00:10:32,070
Speaker 0: You know, some, you know, are the three, right?

153
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:43,869
Speaker 0: Some, uh, you know, uh, dilapidated government somewhere here that has nuclear weapons and is being, you know, ravaged by climate crisis might end up using them.

154
00:10:44,891 --> 00:10:52,810
Speaker 0: If it's a strong government that is in good shape and isn't facing crisis, I mean, it's less likely to news.

155
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:59,490
Speaker 1: I'm not going to talk about just because, uh, it's moving rapidly and you should just read the real news about this and we'll talk about it later.

156
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:08,370
Speaker 1: But, uh, there is a, there is a very significant likelihood there will be war in Europe with Russia and Ukraine in the nearing future.

157
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:12,449
Speaker 0: I don't know why Russia wants to invade Ukraine so bad.

158
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:14,330
Speaker 0: Uh, one thing I don't understand.

159
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,025
Speaker 0: Just let it go.

160
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:19,529
Speaker 1: A light, a light stroll to Wikipedia actually answers that question pretty directly.

161
00:11:20,153 --> 00:11:20,808
Speaker 0: Uh, just let it go.

162
00:11:21,271 --> 00:11:29,770
Speaker 1: But, uh, to agree, you are making an obvious smart point, but, uh, same thing with China and all those islands.

163
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,327
Speaker 0: Let them go.

164
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,910
Speaker 1: Just like what Emily, I talk about politics.

165
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,299
Speaker 1: Like, yeah, everything you're saying is 100% to 100% reasonable objectively.

166
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:49,170
Speaker 1: Like people aren't reasonable, but the people in the position of making decisions here have different motives and their motives are stupid and evil and wrong.

167
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:56,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the funny, you know, it doesn't mean, you know, there's no point in focusing on the, you know, solving the new thing, right?

168
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,450
Speaker 0: Or the climate change thing.

169
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:17,350
Speaker 1: We need to solve the, some people are real bad, but, uh, you know, so to give you some perspective, because the, the, the clock was kept at 100 seconds to midnight, which is the closest it's ever been to the theoretical destruction of human society by human hands.

170
00:12:18,411 --> 00:12:23,930
Speaker 1: Uh, and it moved there actually pretty recently and it basically, they're keeping it there.

171
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:28,890
Speaker 1: Uh, the least close to doom it ever was, was during the fall of the Soviet Union.

172
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:36,730
Speaker 1: And then it rapidly started ticking back up because the states that emerged out of that crisis were basically hyper capitalist, uh, disaster states.

173
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:44,890
Speaker 1: But anyway, I highly recommend you go read about why the clock was set to 100 seconds to midnight recently.

174
00:12:45,751 --> 00:12:58,109
Speaker 1: And I just point out that one of the people who spoke at the, uh, the ceremony, because this has been going on for 75 years, uh, was Hank Green, the V of the vlogger guy, the YouTube, the YouTube guy, the YouTube guy.

175
00:12:58,572 --> 00:13:00,870
Speaker 1: Uh, he's actually pretty close to this organization.

176
00:13:01,792 --> 00:13:05,050
Speaker 1: Uh, and I'll just, as you know, I, I'm a fan of the, the green brothers.

177
00:13:05,191 --> 00:13:07,230
Speaker 1: I have been pretty much from the beginning.

178
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:13,494
Speaker 1: Like, I just love those two, but Hank is really like grown as the one I paid the most attention to.

179
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:16,229
Speaker 1: And I really like, he's very insightful and I like what he has to say.

180
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:21,428
Speaker 1: And I think you will be interested in what he had to say about why the doomsday clock is set, where it's set.

181
00:13:23,782 --> 00:13:26,240
Speaker 1: Was that enough time for you to come up with the news or I got to keep going?

182
00:13:27,143 --> 00:13:28,820
Speaker 0: No, I didn't really see anything that interesting.

183
00:13:29,443 --> 00:13:30,699
Speaker 1: So I got another little news.

184
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:37,180
Speaker 1: Uh, it's one of those things that's not news to anyone, but it is always valuable to look at case studies.

185
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:49,940
Speaker 1: If there's something you care about, like look at individual actual concrete, non hypothetical examples of something you're mad about or interested in, uh, independent of looking at actual data about behavior and aggregate.

186
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:58,640
Speaker 1: So this is a story on vice, really short, really simple, but it's journalism in that it follows a handful of gaming NFTs.

187
00:14:00,101 --> 00:14:03,840
Speaker 1: Uh, specifically like, like it follows like who bought these things?

188
00:14:04,266 --> 00:14:05,179
Speaker 1: What happened to them?

189
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,899
Speaker 1: Like, let's talk to the person who owns it to see what their deal is.

190
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:25,680
Speaker 1: And it is fascinating because the story here seems to be the people they talk to who actually for real have an NFT and are not just an NFT scammer selling NFTs kind of bottom out of vague curiosity at best.

191
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:29,639
Speaker 1: Don't give a shit about NFTs, barely understand them.

192
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:38,679
Speaker 1: And like it is the most interesting one was the person who bought one because they were themselves doing journalism on what it's like to buy one.

193
00:14:40,015 --> 00:14:40,099
Speaker 0: Yeah.

194
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,440
Speaker 0: I mean, this isn't anything new.

195
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,700
Speaker 0: We talk about this all the time.

196
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:54,500
Speaker 0: That's how, you know, we're the kind of people where any decision we make in life, even the simplest thing, like I'm going to go to the grocery store and buy some fucking, I don't know, uh, dishwashing detergent.

197
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:54,920
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

198
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:03,399
Speaker 1: That's me and Scott spending like hours reading about different chemicals in dishwashing detergents, trying to figure out which brands are all actually the same brand.

199
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:15,319
Speaker 0: Like trying to find, trying to find a bootleg access to consumer reports, figuring out, you know, the tabs, the powder, the liquid with, you know, which with our, our type of dishwasher, which mode to use, what, you know, it's all.

200
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,860
Speaker 1: There is a, there is a, there's a, there's a YouTube video that goes deep into how you got to use that.

201
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,140
Speaker 0: I'm aware of, I've seen the same YouTube video.

202
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,220
Speaker 1: Did you see the followup that had several retractions and updates?

203
00:15:26,261 --> 00:15:26,940
Speaker 1: That's even longer.

204
00:15:27,121 --> 00:15:28,679
Speaker 0: I mean, which of the several followers?

205
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:37,719
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is we're the kind of people we think really hard about everything, you know, and we, you know, we research and whatnot.

206
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,718
Speaker 0: A lot of people just sort of coast through life, right?

207
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:44,520
Speaker 0: You're not thinking too hard, right?

208
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,980
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, if they need to buy some pad of paper, right?

209
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:54,460
Speaker 0: They'll just go to Staples or a drug store and just grab the cheapest one.

210
00:15:55,063 --> 00:15:57,120
Speaker 0: Whereas I'm like, what's the nicest paper?

211
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,560
Speaker 0: What kind of pen do I have?

212
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:01,040
Speaker 0: What do I should get the lines?

213
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,180
Speaker 1: How far apart should I even need a pen or paper?

214
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,119
Speaker 1: Like, do I, do I really actually need this?

215
00:16:06,481 --> 00:16:11,560
Speaker 1: A lot of my research when I think I'm buying anything is, do I need a thing to solve this problem at all?

216
00:16:12,443 --> 00:16:12,580
Speaker 0: Right.

217
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,080
Speaker 0: And not even just buying things, just doing things, right?

218
00:16:15,403 --> 00:16:16,480
Speaker 0: Ah, I have to cut up this onion.

219
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,420
Speaker 0: What cutting technique should I use?

220
00:16:18,821 --> 00:16:21,780
Speaker 0: Which, which of the knives I already bought should I be using?

221
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,060
Speaker 0: What, you know, it's like techniques, you know, all these things.

222
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,140
Speaker 0: We're thinking really hard.

223
00:16:26,521 --> 00:16:34,880
Speaker 0: And even if we're not thinking hard about a particular problem we have right now, I just constantly read things all over all the time.

224
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:42,258
Speaker 0: I spend most of my time just reading things all over and learning techniques, information about things.

225
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:48,779
Speaker 0: So I think most people don't do that or don't do it to the same extent that I do.

226
00:16:49,261 --> 00:16:55,359
Speaker 0: Now, therefore it's like, if they open, they're playing a video game, they open it up and it says, Hey, buy this NFT skin.

227
00:16:55,704 --> 00:16:56,879
Speaker 0: It's like, all right.

228
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:02,280
Speaker 0: You know, they're the kind of person who doesn't think too hard about that then.

229
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,319
Speaker 0: And they got money and they want the thing.

230
00:17:04,729 --> 00:17:04,977
Speaker 0: Okay.

231
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:05,290
Speaker 0: Yeah.

232
00:17:05,521 --> 00:17:06,155
Speaker 0: They just do it.

233
00:17:06,522 --> 00:17:06,740
Speaker 0: All right.

234
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:12,536
Speaker 0: You know, they're not like necessarily an NFT believer or, you know, something like that.

235
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:13,093
Speaker 0: They might be.

236
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:17,539
Speaker 0: Um, but it's like, they're just going along with life.

237
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:21,780
Speaker 1: Not, you know, but it's also, I mean, not that everyone does that for everything.

238
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,799
Speaker 1: Like for all the research I do for like, there's a certain type of purchase.

239
00:17:25,192 --> 00:17:25,316
Speaker 0: I do.

240
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:30,000
Speaker 0: I don't think there's anything I don't like in terms of anything I do in life.

241
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:33,280
Speaker 0: I think I've researched the techniques and equipment.

242
00:17:34,163 --> 00:17:42,739
Speaker 1: But in terms of there, there are classes of completely fungible consumer products where I literally do not care and buy whatever the generic option is.

243
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:50,362
Speaker 0: But that is such a, I think the it's, if anything in my life that I don't like heavily research.

244
00:17:50,543 --> 00:18:02,900
Speaker 0: the right way or the best way of doing a thing is, uh, or like any, like even minor life decisions or major ones, the only times I don't do extensive research investigation.

245
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,720
Speaker 1: I'll give you an example.

246
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,340
Speaker 1: I bought a battery for my car.

247
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,620
Speaker 1: I did zero research.

248
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:12,780
Speaker 1: I just bought an equity, the cheapest battery from a brand that appeared to be a real brand.

249
00:18:13,161 --> 00:18:20,100
Speaker 0: that was the only time I don't do that is if it's something I've decided I'm just not going to do that way.

250
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,520
Speaker 0: I don't have to, you know, it doesn't matter what choice.

251
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:27,000
Speaker 0: Cause I just, I chose not to, but, uh, it's really funny.

252
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,860
Speaker 0: I do have a goal of just, you know, minimizing life, right?

253
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,178
Speaker 0: Do as few things as possible.

254
00:18:31,702 --> 00:18:35,640
Speaker 1: But at least in the NFTs, like fake space where, you know, NFTs are just a scam.

255
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,046
Speaker 1: It is the media.

256
00:18:38,427 --> 00:18:51,139
Speaker 1: like landscape around NFTs acts like they're a thing because the most of the conversation about NFTs are from the people who are running NFT scams and Astro turfing everywhere they can Astro turf.

257
00:18:51,861 --> 00:18:59,200
Speaker 0: But I mean, a large, a large part of media is not at, you know, a very small part of media is journalists who think hard about a thing.

258
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:12,019
Speaker 0: And even if they do think hard about a thing, they write about the thing from within its own context and not, you know, I think about almost everything I ever encountered, like case in point, I consider it with a global context.

259
00:19:12,441 --> 00:19:24,920
Speaker 1: Like a good journalist would literally point out that the Republican party in America is engaged in fascist voter suppression, but no, they're going to talk about them as somehow being an equal entity to other political parties.

260
00:19:25,342 --> 00:19:29,560
Speaker 1: And they're going to have this very neutral, simplistic, like dialogue about it.

261
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,740
Speaker 0: That's not about shrinking the context.

262
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,283
Speaker 0: That's just.

263
00:19:32,424 --> 00:19:34,080
Speaker 0: that's just about being wrong.

264
00:19:35,762 --> 00:19:45,920
Speaker 0: But it's like I'm talking about, like, you know, someone might be discussing like a game and they talk about it within, you know, these with these assumptions already existing, right?

265
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:52,120
Speaker 0: Like, you know, whereas I'm going to look at like, OK, you're playing this game in the world, right on Earth.

266
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,940
Speaker 0: And the only assumption I have is the conservation of matter and energy.

267
00:19:57,461 --> 00:20:01,220
Speaker 1: So the listener pointed out your extensive research.

268
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:11,599
Speaker 1: Does this apply to decisions you make in games, which I know that you often do not do any research on how, say, work arts work in civilization sex?

269
00:20:12,643 --> 00:20:15,158
Speaker 0: Oh, well, that's just because it's a pain, too much of a pain in the ass.

270
00:20:17,442 --> 00:20:22,760
Speaker 0: But no, I'd also don't like it when I am unable to do the right.

271
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:28,120
Speaker 0: I don't enjoy the games that require too much research into useless minutia.

272
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:31,920
Speaker 1: So so in one last news, you can watch it if you want to.

273
00:20:32,985 --> 00:20:35,840
Speaker 1: It's 11, almost 12 hours long because they tried their best.

274
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:45,840
Speaker 1: So last night, the Democratic Party of the US basically forced the issue through a somewhat complicated and weird Senate procedure to force a floor vote.

275
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:53,279
Speaker 1: Basically, in the Senate, you can't like force a vote without weird shenanigans because of how broken that chamber of the American government is.

276
00:20:54,180 --> 00:21:04,139
Speaker 1: So because, you know, we need to pass voting rights legislation or huge numbers of non white people basically lose access to the vote in the United States, mostly in Republican controlled states.

277
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:05,540
Speaker 1: This is all common knowledge.

278
00:21:06,061 --> 00:21:16,000
Speaker 1: But one of the avenues, one of the few avenues we have to stop this is to pass a specific bill in our Senate, which has passed our house and is ready to be signed by our president.

279
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:27,179
Speaker 1: And because of the obscure rules of the Senate, basically you need 51 people to vote to proceed or the bill is just dead.

280
00:21:28,122 --> 00:21:32,800
Speaker 1: And basically what the Democrats did is pull the shenanigans to actually force that vote.

281
00:21:33,021 --> 00:21:37,780
Speaker 1: Up until this point, nobody actually had to say they were against the voting rights.

282
00:21:38,181 --> 00:21:42,965
Speaker 1: They only had to just not show up, let the filibuster happen and kind of get away with it.

283
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:52,880
Speaker 1: So they basically exercised their final power to make it clear that there is no possible way to pass a bill like this via legal channels in the Senate.

284
00:21:53,241 --> 00:22:01,540
Speaker 1: Whatever we do about the 2022 elections, there is no way to solve it via the existing Democratic process in the United States Federal Congress.

285
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,019
Speaker 1: They forced the issue.

286
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,359
Speaker 0: Following the rules that exist, yeah?

287
00:22:04,742 --> 00:22:09,158
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, the rules that exist can only be changed by the exact same vote of that body.

288
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,700
Speaker 0: But I mean, you only need to change the rules if you've already decided to follow them.

289
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:22,206
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think there's any world where the Senate just passes a bill not following Senate rules.

290
00:22:22,267 --> 00:22:23,580
Speaker 1: that somehow becomes law.

291
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:29,140
Speaker 0: I'm just saying you only have to change rules if you already have decided to follow rules.

292
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,718
Speaker 0: If you're not following rules, doesn't matter what the rules are.

293
00:22:32,722 --> 00:22:34,600
Speaker 1: So this is the interesting thing.

294
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:42,240
Speaker 1: It's worth watching the end of it, because what is interesting is that they basically went as hard as possible in the actual debate.

295
00:22:42,762 --> 00:22:51,540
Speaker 1: And it was one of the first times in my life I've seen an actual, serious, no punches are pulled, real discussion of an issue like this.

296
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:58,797
Speaker 1: Like they went as hard as you can imagine going and they made extremely succinct, simple points.

297
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:05,198
Speaker 1: They made it very clear that the vote is literally just to protect the voting rights of non-white people.

298
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,040
Speaker 1: And 52 senators said, yeah, fuck that.

299
00:23:08,242 --> 00:23:09,320
Speaker 1: I'm going to vote no on the record.

300
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:09,777
Speaker 1: Fuck you.

301
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,175
Speaker 1: It's over.

302
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's, you know, because they're bad people.

303
00:23:13,464 --> 00:23:13,560
Speaker 1: Yep.

304
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,920
Speaker 0: So nothing was learned or gained.

305
00:23:17,841 --> 00:23:22,079
Speaker 1: No, actually, one thing was learned because this is actually something that's moderately important.

306
00:23:22,761 --> 00:23:42,340
Speaker 1: A big, false and honestly ridiculous argument that a lot of leftists and progressives in America have been making in public channels and even pundits have been making is they try to make a case that even if you got these two shitbag, like, traitor senators to vote on this bill, other Democrats wouldn't let this filibuster go away.

307
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,199
Speaker 1: Like there's other people.

308
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,078
Speaker 0: That's not true at all.

309
00:23:44,281 --> 00:23:45,499
Speaker 0: It's just two shitbags.

310
00:23:46,066 --> 00:23:46,539
Speaker 0: We know that.

311
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,479
Speaker 1: No one could prove that.

312
00:23:49,101 --> 00:23:49,819
Speaker 1: No one believed that.

313
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,879
Speaker 0: You know, in case you weren't on the same page that we've been on.

314
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,640
Speaker 1: If you believe that ridiculous talking point, that's what happened.

315
00:23:57,285 --> 00:23:59,180
Speaker 0: I never I haven't heard of anyone who said that.

316
00:23:59,602 --> 00:24:01,620
Speaker 0: But that is extremely widespread, Scott.

317
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,318
Speaker 1: Even among some of our friends, it is.

318
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,540
Speaker 0: Well, if you didn't realize it was just two shitbags holding up the entire country.

319
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,456
Speaker 0: Now, you know.

320
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:09,832
Speaker 1: Yep.

321
00:24:10,144 --> 00:24:10,559
Speaker 1: But it is.

322
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,499
Speaker 1: But that argument is absolutely false because 48 Democrats voted right then and there to end the filibuster.

323
00:24:17,061 --> 00:24:26,220
Speaker 1: It would have happened instantly if these two shitbags or if any two Republican senators who are also shitbags had voted.

324
00:24:26,581 --> 00:24:33,960
Speaker 1: So fifty two human beings who represent roughly twenty five percent of the American population have an absolute veto on all legislation.

325
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:43,580
Speaker 1: And forty eight senators representing a actually terrifyingly small percentage, terrifyingly large percentage of the population have zero recourse.

326
00:24:44,803 --> 00:24:46,540
Speaker 0: And nothing new was learned or gained.

327
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,780
Speaker 1: The thing we just said was learned because a lot of people.

328
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,460
Speaker 0: Well, I guess someone needed to learn that, but nothing new was learned.

329
00:24:52,781 --> 00:24:59,939
Speaker 1: I guess the point is a scary number of people needed to learn that there are actually 48 senators willing to overturn the filibuster for this.

330
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:04,799
Speaker 0: I think the only thing that was gained is that you made all those old white guys sit there for that many hours.

331
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:11,460
Speaker 1: The only possible thing that Democrats could do now in the Senate is something that they started to do last night.

332
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,140
Speaker 1: My wonder is the threat or whatever.

333
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:15,040
Speaker 1: But there is one other thing is kind of obscure.

334
00:25:15,402 --> 00:25:17,540
Speaker 1: There is the concept of a reverse filibuster.

335
00:25:18,982 --> 00:25:20,772
Speaker 1: It was used in like 2003 by the Republicans once.

336
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:27,608
Speaker 1: I don't know of any other instance of it happening, but basically what you do is you bring a bill to the floor, OK?

337
00:25:29,721 --> 00:25:30,879
Speaker 1: You vote to make it pass.

338
00:25:31,741 --> 00:25:35,660
Speaker 1: The Republicans then filibuster filibuster you at the last second.

339
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,640
Speaker 1: You make sure that your majority leader votes last.

340
00:25:37,981 --> 00:25:39,099
Speaker 1: You vote no against your own bill.

341
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:41,931
Speaker 1: So it gets pulled from the floor without like.

342
00:25:42,353 --> 00:25:44,899
Speaker 1: if you vote yes for it and it fails, you can't bring it back to the floor.

343
00:25:45,322 --> 00:25:49,036
Speaker 1: But if you vote no and pull it from the floor, you can theoretically bring it back to the floor.

344
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,379
Speaker 1: So you bring it to the floor.

345
00:25:51,043 --> 00:25:51,878
Speaker 1: All the votes come in.

346
00:25:52,483 --> 00:25:54,439
Speaker 1: If it didn't pass, you vote against it.

347
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,579
Speaker 1: Bring it back from the floor.

348
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:59,577
Speaker 1: You immediately raise a point of order and bring it back to the fucking floor and you start over.

349
00:26:01,021 --> 00:26:04,960
Speaker 0: OK, so but they're happy to do that because that what does that get you?

350
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,560
Speaker 0: They don't want anything to pass ever.

351
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:12,519
Speaker 0: So if you keep doing that and you keep repeating it, so I think they'll get what they want, which is you just write this.

352
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:20,540
Speaker 1: You can do one thing because the thing the reason the filibuster is so broken in America is that for most of its history, it was a talking filibuster.

353
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,075
Speaker 1: If you wanted to filibuster something, you had to actually stand up there and piss your pants.

354
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,400
Speaker 1: Keep talking.

355
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,118
Speaker 1: Read the phone book.

356
00:26:27,121 --> 00:26:30,360
Speaker 1: So when they change that rule, you can do nothing and filibuster.

357
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,620
Speaker 1: Filibusters are just automatic.

358
00:26:32,941 --> 00:26:39,399
Speaker 1: The thing you could do with the reverse filibuster is force all those old men to sit there and they literally cannot leave.

359
00:26:39,861 --> 00:26:46,679
Speaker 1: If once you start this process, if they leave, the bill passes, they would be forced to sit there and wait you out.

360
00:26:47,202 --> 00:26:51,420
Speaker 1: And you could force a ridiculous public spectacle and also block all other Senate business.

361
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,459
Speaker 1: That's basically the last holy grail.

362
00:26:53,900 --> 00:27:02,978
Speaker 0: Problem is, is you still need even if you, you know, OK, you avoided this filibuster thing and now you're actually voting on the bill itself, whether it will become law.

363
00:27:03,721 --> 00:27:08,160
Speaker 0: You still need 50 votes and a tiebreaker to pass the law.

364
00:27:08,606 --> 00:27:09,439
Speaker 1: Which could happen.

365
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:14,000
Speaker 0: But do you think the two shit bags who are going to vote for the law?

366
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,249
Speaker 1: So it's like there's more complication.

367
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:22,980
Speaker 1: I'm skipping, but I think one of those two shit bags could be brought enough to ship.

368
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:30,118
Speaker 1: The problem is one of them seems to just be a plant like she is just like working with Republicans openly at this point.

369
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:35,040
Speaker 0: So so it won't really matter even if you get past the filibuster and then.

370
00:27:35,691 --> 00:27:35,920
Speaker 0: Right.

371
00:27:36,242 --> 00:27:39,360
Speaker 0: OK, let's say you get this thing past the filibuster.

372
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,338
Speaker 0: You pass this law.

373
00:27:40,582 --> 00:27:41,220
Speaker 1: It's instantly law.

374
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,280
Speaker 1: Biden signs it that day.

375
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,128
Speaker 1: He has said as much.

376
00:27:43,916 --> 00:27:44,340
Speaker 0: that is true.

377
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,239
Speaker 1: Already passed the House.

378
00:27:46,127 --> 00:27:46,599
Speaker 0: That's true.

379
00:27:47,204 --> 00:27:48,259
Speaker 0: Here's what's not true.

380
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,660
Speaker 1: The Supreme Court could just overturn it immediately if they wanted.

381
00:27:51,401 --> 00:27:54,239
Speaker 0: Well, that but not overturn it.

382
00:27:54,501 --> 00:28:00,200
Speaker 0: But OK, so some red state is still conducting voter suppression against the law.

383
00:28:00,551 --> 00:28:00,759
Speaker 0: Right.

384
00:28:01,161 --> 00:28:06,220
Speaker 0: You have to now sue that state in a court and then you have to fight in the court.

385
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,398
Speaker 0: And then even if the.

386
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,600
Speaker 1: Oh, do you actually know what's in the John Lewis voting?

387
00:28:10,961 --> 00:28:18,559
Speaker 1: That voting rights act is watertight, trivial to enforce, almost impossible to pull up into the courts or the Supreme Court.

388
00:28:19,023 --> 00:28:20,759
Speaker 1: And more importantly, you know what it does.

389
00:28:21,321 --> 00:28:28,199
Speaker 1: It basically gives the Department of Justice, which is way less constrained by rules than Congress, the ability to enforce.

390
00:28:29,201 --> 00:28:35,055
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, you're definitely going to get some enforcement, but, you know, it's not.

391
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,471
Speaker 1: Also, honestly, we really only need this bill for a couple of swing states for the short term.

392
00:28:39,721 --> 00:28:43,120
Speaker 1: Like it only needs to really be enforced in like Georgia and a couple other places.

393
00:28:43,881 --> 00:28:48,079
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, because I mean, it doesn't matter if that, you know, OK, voter suppress all you want in Utah.

394
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,153
Speaker 1: It's the West Virginia is 98 percent white.

395
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:55,440
Speaker 1: No statewide election goes toward the Democrats in that state under any circumstances.

396
00:28:56,461 --> 00:29:00,979
Speaker 1: But the other new piece of information that we get to the rest of the show, that's actually very important.

397
00:29:01,861 --> 00:29:08,280
Speaker 1: There is a way forward if the Democrats hold the House in 2022, which is not impossible.

398
00:29:09,461 --> 00:29:10,279
Speaker 0: It seems unlikely.

399
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:20,820
Speaker 1: It's less unlikely than it was a few weeks ago because the gerrymandering the Republicans were doing wasn't actually as effective as people expected because they're running out of room to gerrymander.

400
00:29:21,225 --> 00:29:22,339
Speaker 1: They've gerrymandered so much.

401
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:27,560
Speaker 0: The only hope that I have is enough Republicans died of covid.

402
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,157
Speaker 0: That's my hope.

403
00:29:29,364 --> 00:29:31,079
Speaker 1: I was I was actually about to bring that up.

404
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:31,978
Speaker 1: That is what I look.

405
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,000
Speaker 0: But I did some cursory research on that at one point.

406
00:29:35,101 --> 00:29:38,258
Speaker 0: I was like, all right, how many people died of covid in Florida?

407
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:38,620
Speaker 0: total?

408
00:29:39,204 --> 00:29:40,160
Speaker 1: Oh, no, you don't need Florida.

409
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,759
Speaker 0: Where the margins on like, you know, I looked at them.

410
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,940
Speaker 1: I don't even need Florida.

411
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:47,820
Speaker 1: All that matters is like Arizona, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin.

412
00:29:49,003 --> 00:29:50,600
Speaker 0: I think I looked at also at like Texas.

413
00:29:51,321 --> 00:29:51,803
Speaker 0: But it's like.

414
00:29:52,284 --> 00:30:03,520
Speaker 0: even it was like even if every person who died of covid in Florida was a Republican and all, you know, it's like it wasn't enough to make up the margins on any of the statewide elections.

415
00:30:03,861 --> 00:30:06,360
Speaker 0: So I don't think that's going to remember.

416
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:12,000
Speaker 1: All we have to do theoretically is win what we like, win things that like things we've won very recently.

417
00:30:12,446 --> 00:30:13,280
Speaker 1: It's not impossible.

418
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,940
Speaker 1: It's actually it's plausible.

419
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:20,600
Speaker 1: But mostly Republican seats are up for election in the Senate in twenty twenty two.

420
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:33,559
Speaker 1: Very few Democrats are up, meaning they're mostly playing defense because forty eight senators, none of whom are likely to lose their seats, are have voted yes for this and would vote yes for it again.

421
00:30:34,482 --> 00:30:37,034
Speaker 1: If we pick up even two seats, we can immediately pass this bill.

422
00:30:37,174 --> 00:30:39,477
Speaker 1: if we hold if we hold the House by even one seat.

423
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:42,199
Speaker 0: Well, which two seats do you think you're going to get?

424
00:30:42,662 --> 00:30:44,775
Speaker 1: There are several that I think talking about.

425
00:30:44,795 --> 00:30:45,700
Speaker 1: that's out of scope for the show.

426
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,280
Speaker 1: You could join us in the angry politics section of the discard board.

427
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,500
Speaker 1: We're talking about this constantly.

428
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:54,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, there's no, but I'm saying I don't know what you're talking about.

429
00:30:55,302 --> 00:30:58,400
Speaker 0: To simultaneously talk about a hopeless and free to serve.

430
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,800
Speaker 1: Picking up two Senate seats makes it actually for real possible to pass this bill.

431
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,360
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

432
00:31:12,481 --> 00:31:13,679
Speaker 1: So check this out.

433
00:31:13,921 --> 00:31:19,040
Speaker 1: This I found this video as part of a conversation I was having about old commercials.

434
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:30,120
Speaker 1: And this is a compilation of a bunch of commercials for dot com companies during the late 90s, early 2000s dot com boom, which was like Mike.

435
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,540
Speaker 1: That was like Scott and I were already nerds.

436
00:31:34,342 --> 00:31:37,614
Speaker 1: And this was like before the Internet existed.

437
00:31:37,654 --> 00:31:40,892
Speaker 1: in the way that you know today, like this is Web 1.0 Internet ads.

438
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:43,239
Speaker 1: Mm hmm.

439
00:31:43,421 --> 00:31:45,139
Speaker 0: It is paperweight paperweight style.

440
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is amazing.

441
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:56,160
Speaker 1: Like just what some of these are selling, especially when you see screenshots of what websites look like back then, like I know what websites look like back then.

442
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,339
Speaker 0: I made those websites and use those websites.

443
00:31:58,561 --> 00:31:59,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, I made and use those websites.

444
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:07,563
Speaker 1: This was an era when most online shopping meant mail a check or money order in the via the U.S.

445
00:32:07,623 --> 00:32:11,620
Speaker 1: post office to a company after you bought something on their website.

446
00:32:14,103 --> 00:32:17,580
Speaker 0: Or type your credit card number into an unencrypted Web form and make an HDTV post.

447
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,147
Speaker 1: Yep.

448
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,519
Speaker 1: Very few websites could accept credit cards back then.

449
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:22,758
Speaker 1: Very few.

450
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,800
Speaker 0: And they weren't accepting them the way they are now, where like a transaction happens.

451
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:35,998
Speaker 0: You were basically just posting and then it was going into a database or a file and someone at the other end would then look in that file and then process your order manually.

452
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:42,320
Speaker 0: It'd be like it'd be like if I sent you an email with my credit card number and said, I'd like two pizzas, please.

453
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:49,479
Speaker 0: And then someone opened the email, looked at it, then charged my card using their point of sale system and then started making the pizzas.

454
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:55,420
Speaker 1: That is, I'm pretty sure how that one experimental online pizza delivery website at RIT worked.

455
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:01,240
Speaker 0: I mean, I worked at broa.com for many years before that, before I got there.

456
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,380
Speaker 0: Well, before I got there.

457
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:20,420
Speaker 0: But when that business was new in the late 90s, it was literally just email these two and they would run down physically to the theater and buy the tickets and then they would get your money and then you would show up to New York and then you'd come to the office and they'd give you the tickets from the safe that they bought.

458
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:26,938
Speaker 1: So I just scrolled down and I saw the top YouTube comment on this video and it hit me right in the old.

459
00:33:27,601 --> 00:33:28,459
Speaker 1: I'm just going to read this.

460
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,480
Speaker 1: It's one sentence quote.

461
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,680
Speaker 1: I never knew Amazon was originally a book only website.

462
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:33,898
Speaker 0: Yeah.

463
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,399
Speaker 0: People don't know that they just sold books.

464
00:33:37,381 --> 00:33:39,988
Speaker 0: The first thing I ever bought on Amazon was a copy of catch 22 a book.

465
00:33:42,388 --> 00:33:42,858
Speaker 1: So what do you got?

466
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:44,579
Speaker 0: What do I have?

467
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,500
Speaker 0: So, uh, we love the go, the old factory videos, right?

468
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:53,964
Speaker 0: Anytime you see the inside of a real factory making some, you know, common everyday goods, right?

469
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:58,500
Speaker 0: Really fascinating stuff, really satisfying, especially a lot of the processes.

470
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:05,000
Speaker 0: Here's one that is not just interesting for the process and how shockingly manual a lot of it is.

471
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:09,840
Speaker 0: I think a lot more could be automated in this factory, even with my limited factory knowledge.

472
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:19,199
Speaker 0: But what's really fascinating is just, you know, the, I guess, eco friendliness in this factory in South Korea where golf is pretty popular.

473
00:34:19,281 --> 00:34:20,679
Speaker 0: It's one of the golf playing nations.

474
00:34:22,281 --> 00:34:29,279
Speaker 0: They are taking old golf balls, which usually go to the driving range and then go to the mini golf and then go to the garbage.

475
00:34:29,686 --> 00:34:29,958
Speaker 0: Right.

476
00:34:30,981 --> 00:34:34,319
Speaker 0: And basically, if you think about a golf ball, it's like, yeah, you use it.

477
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:38,460
Speaker 0: You know, and for like a round of golf, maybe you lose some in the woods, right?

478
00:34:38,501 --> 00:34:39,239
Speaker 0: And they're still good.

479
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:43,440
Speaker 0: But if they don't lose them to the woods, they're not really good to use again.

480
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:51,780
Speaker 0: The next game of golf, they've gotten beat up and damaged and whatnot, but it's only really the outside shell that's damaged from flexing and getting smacked.

481
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:59,957
Speaker 0: The inside is largely just fine, um, you know, and could see a lot more use than the outside could see.

482
00:35:00,662 --> 00:35:03,860
Speaker 0: And what they do in this video is they basically get old golf balls.

483
00:35:04,364 --> 00:35:06,440
Speaker 0: They cut the outside off and throw it away.

484
00:35:06,881 --> 00:35:17,920
Speaker 0: And then they make new outsides and they're reusing golf balls, which is very economic, ecologically good, not wasting so much plastic and rubber.

485
00:35:18,645 --> 00:35:20,078
Speaker 0: So that's pretty cool.

486
00:35:21,642 --> 00:35:31,220
Speaker 1: And in general, the the actual reality of how physical things and physical labor get done are way more important to society than the tech stuff that we're doing.

487
00:35:32,221 --> 00:35:41,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, if all golf balls were, you know, made this way, like reused in this fashion, instead of just being thrown out or lost in the woods, that would probably have a pretty significant impact.

488
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:48,538
Speaker 1: So in the moment, getting used to the book club book, The Tale of Genji, Scott has reached the end.

489
00:35:48,821 --> 00:35:51,410
Speaker 1: I am rapidly already a third into.

490
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,380
Speaker 0: I'm a 33 percent done with the next book club.

491
00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:00,279
Speaker 1: I feel like we'll do that next book club book inside of a couple of weeks tops after we finish this one.

492
00:36:00,744 --> 00:36:02,500
Speaker 1: But I'm steamrolling ahead.

493
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,799
Speaker 1: I think Genji is about to die.

494
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:07,839
Speaker 0: I feel like I think you are not that close to the end that you got a ways to go.

495
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:12,680
Speaker 1: I think he's going to die like next chapter, which means you better read some more.

496
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,866
Speaker 1: Well, that's the I know.

497
00:36:14,886 --> 00:36:21,100
Speaker 1: I know the historical context of the chapter chapters that follow at least more so than I know about the other part.

498
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,872
Speaker 0: They are easier to read, but they are not.

499
00:36:24,354 --> 00:36:25,979
Speaker 0: you know, they're going to take you some time still.

500
00:36:26,232 --> 00:36:26,400
Speaker 1: Yeah.

501
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:35,340
Speaker 0: But I also when I'm reading this book, I read it pretty fast, but partly because every time I read the chapter where Genji dies, that one's going to take you.

502
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,478
Speaker 0: You're going to read that one real fast.

503
00:36:37,043 --> 00:36:38,514
Speaker 1: Oh, I looked ahead and I saw.

504
00:36:38,676 --> 00:36:39,180
Speaker 1: I saw that one.

505
00:36:40,087 --> 00:36:40,939
Speaker 1: I saw that chapter.

506
00:36:41,482 --> 00:36:42,659
Speaker 1: That's that's cool and clever.

507
00:36:43,941 --> 00:36:47,500
Speaker 1: Anyway, I also learned something about the chapters that come after that.

508
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,480
Speaker 1: And there's a lot of debate over the intent around them.

509
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,020
Speaker 1: There's even some debate around who wrote them, apparently.

510
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:54,974
Speaker 1: You know.

511
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,582
Speaker 1: Yeah, but also Genji is only like 40.

512
00:36:59,582 --> 00:37:02,479
Speaker 0: So people didn't live that long back then.

513
00:37:03,461 --> 00:37:04,580
Speaker 1: And Turnabout's fair play.

514
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:10,700
Speaker 1: Some of the things that happened to Genji in the last few chapters are a lot like the things that Genji was doing to other people in earlier chapters.

515
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,178
Speaker 1: You see the cycle there.

516
00:37:13,702 --> 00:37:15,909
Speaker 1: I got things to say about like the.

517
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:24,200
Speaker 1: the structure of these books get more and more like modern novels the further you get into them as you see her clearly refining her technique.

518
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,880
Speaker 1: And that's the thing that is standing out the most to me as I get near the end.

519
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,320
Speaker 0: It's like reading a webcomic.

520
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,979
Speaker 0: It gets better as the time goes on.

521
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:37,500
Speaker 1: Like if you just grab the Tale of Genji and read one of the later chapters, you'll understand it a lot better than if you read like the second chapter.

522
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:45,440
Speaker 0: And it's it's not just your understanding of it that improved because I went back and tried to read an earlier chapter and it was still hard to know.

523
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,500
Speaker 1: There's a lot more context in the text.

524
00:37:47,701 --> 00:37:51,720
Speaker 1: There's a lot more like of the way we expect books to be written in the text.

525
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,420
Speaker 1: It's it's fascinating.

526
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:57,580
Speaker 1: That's I'm taking more away from that than I am from anything else in these books anyway.

527
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,780
Speaker 1: Well, this book, these chapters anyway.

528
00:38:00,602 --> 00:38:01,679
Speaker 1: So we'll be doing that.

529
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,659
Speaker 1: We'll be finishing that show up in the next couple of weeks.

530
00:38:04,162 --> 00:38:07,140
Speaker 1: And then we'll be Steve Rollin ahead with a bunch of book club books.

531
00:38:07,221 --> 00:38:08,280
Speaker 1: And I have a pile of nonfiction.

532
00:38:08,381 --> 00:38:10,299
Speaker 1: I've been really, really itching to read.

533
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,898
Speaker 1: Otherwise, PAX East.

534
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,900
Speaker 1: Most likely the best is either us or likely just me.

535
00:38:20,261 --> 00:38:24,780
Speaker 1: We'll be there for one day to do one or two panels like I did for PAX Unplugged.

536
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,499
Speaker 1: I feel like that's the extent.

537
00:38:27,921 --> 00:38:31,040
Speaker 1: But Tracy, see if if he's going to do a panel, I'm going to a panel.

538
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,240
Speaker 1: See if we can arrange them on the same day and maybe we'll do a panel together.

539
00:38:33,384 --> 00:38:33,918
Speaker 1: If you don't want to go.

540
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,839
Speaker 0: Not going to Boston just to do a panel.

541
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:37,499
Speaker 1: I'll go to Boston.

542
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:44,359
Speaker 1: I work in an industry where pre-COVID I would just go to Boston for the day, like kind of commonly as part of my job.

543
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:49,079
Speaker 1: Like I'd literally just get up, get out in a cellar, go to Boston, work there all day and get out in a cellar home.

544
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,934
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, not doing it.

545
00:38:51,641 --> 00:38:52,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see.

546
00:38:52,301 --> 00:38:53,900
Speaker 1: April is later than other PAXes.

547
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,726
Speaker 1: So I'm less hesitant about.

548
00:38:57,228 --> 00:39:01,980
Speaker 1: I hope the COVID situation is way better in April than it is now.

549
00:39:03,462 --> 00:39:22,460
Speaker 1: But mostly having been to PAX Unplugged for a few hours, the thing I would be most worried about at a gaming con now is even if it was safe to go, I discovered what it's like to be at a table with four people trying to talk to each other in masks in a place that is as echoey and loud as a gaming space at a con like PAX East.

550
00:39:23,483 --> 00:39:26,000
Speaker 1: I don't think most people can understand each other well enough to play an RPG.

551
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:27,530
Speaker 0: No.

552
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:28,819
Speaker 1: Like that.

553
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:34,080
Speaker 0: That isn't playing RPG under normal circumstances in a non-COVID time.

554
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,760
Speaker 1: There is nothing obstructing the words coming out of my mouth.

555
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:43,599
Speaker 1: Us playing an RPG at PAX East is us yelling at each other for hours at a table and constantly repeating ourselves.

556
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,460
Speaker 0: You need the quiet room, right?

557
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,500
Speaker 0: The quiet room is the way.

558
00:39:45,764 --> 00:39:45,836
Speaker 0: Yep.

559
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,260
Speaker 1: And if we're going to just go to a hotel room, why even go to the con?

560
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:52,200
Speaker 1: Let's just all meet in one of our apartments and play an RPG.

561
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,239
Speaker 0: Yeah, why don't we do that?

562
00:39:53,582 --> 00:39:54,178
Speaker 0: Let's do that.

563
00:39:54,581 --> 00:40:00,159
Speaker 1: I actually do want to start off that Blades in the Dark game in Queens like as soon as I unbubble again.

564
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,380
Speaker 0: I want to play other games.

565
00:40:01,641 --> 00:40:02,519
Speaker 1: Like what game do you want to play?

566
00:40:04,163 --> 00:40:07,180
Speaker 0: I mean, I have a huge pile of indie tabletop RPG PDFs.

567
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,620
Speaker 0: I want to play each one one time.

568
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,820
Speaker 0: I'm not really interested in.

569
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:16,659
Speaker 1: I'm honestly, right now, I'm mostly interested in taking a game I've never played and doing a full campaign to really explore it.

570
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,220
Speaker 0: Full campaign means, you know, I got all these games.

571
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,580
Speaker 0: Just eat the same burger every night?

572
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,760
Speaker 0: It's like, I want to try everything.

573
00:40:23,202 --> 00:40:25,920
Speaker 0: I want to go to the buffet and feast upon all the different games.

574
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,500
Speaker 0: And then maybe after I've tried all these different games, maybe then I'll be like, that one was the real good one.

575
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,519
Speaker 0: Let's play a campaign of that.

576
00:40:31,882 --> 00:40:36,820
Speaker 1: Thing is, I know, I know mostly how these games will go just from reading the rules and having a lot of experience with them.

577
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,039
Speaker 0: I haven't even read the rules yet.

578
00:40:39,392 --> 00:40:39,839
Speaker 1: I did too.

579
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:49,038
Speaker 1: I did stop reading the rules to indie RPGs that have come out in the past couple of years because I have read a lot of indie RPG rules over the years and not played those games yet.

580
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:50,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

581
00:40:50,741 --> 00:40:52,820
Speaker 0: I want to play all these games, one time each at least.

582
00:40:55,263 --> 00:41:01,993
Speaker 1: I guess the thing I'm most interested in in RPGs, now that I've played a campaign for a while again, is that that is what I've always loved.

583
00:41:02,013 --> 00:41:05,599
Speaker 1: the most about RPGs is playing long form, not the one offs.

584
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:10,020
Speaker 1: The one offs are just like hollow appetizers compared to campaigns.

585
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Speaker 0: Me, I don't really care for the campaign.

586
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:23,620
Speaker 1: I mean, my whole life, most of the D&D I played, the vast majority of all role playing I've ever done in my life was from a grand total of five campaigns.

587
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,680
Speaker 0: It's, you know, because with the campaign, it's always more of the same.

588
00:41:27,064 --> 00:41:27,820
Speaker 0: I need the novelty.

589
00:41:27,901 --> 00:41:29,580
Speaker 0: I want to try to explore the same.

590
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,699
Speaker 1: You're doing different things.

591
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,440
Speaker 1: We are taking out the Denver Sisters.

592
00:41:33,403 --> 00:41:34,100
Speaker 0: Okay, whatever.

593
00:41:34,601 --> 00:41:36,420
Speaker 1: Okay, I guess we will play RPGs.

594
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,839
Speaker 1: I'll go run campaigns with everybody else.

595
00:41:38,421 --> 00:41:42,360
Speaker 1: Anyway, so greeting cards.

596
00:41:44,822 --> 00:41:48,016
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're going to do a bunch of shows on different kinds of cards, so stay tuned for that.

597
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:51,380
Speaker 0: Well, I've wanted to do a YouTube series about cards.

598
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,280
Speaker 0: I've had some, you know, but it's a project shit talk situation.

599
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:55,836
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

600
00:41:56,544 --> 00:41:59,380
Speaker 1: We thought about doing a meta show on Geek Nights, and we just recently did one.

601
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:13,960
Speaker 1: So greeting cards or just cards, the kind like Hallmark cards, the card you send to someone for an event based reason, like a birthday, a death, a graduation, a funeral.

602
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,939
Speaker 0: It could also just be a greeting like, hi, I was thinking of you, you know, you also might not send it.

603
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:25,460
Speaker 0: You might like tape it onto a gift or true, you know, hand it to someone.

604
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:32,360
Speaker 0: These are especially in the US because I know that I don't know what the culture of greeting cards is in other countries.

605
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,700
Speaker 0: They're very different everywhere.

606
00:42:35,204 --> 00:42:40,639
Speaker 1: I have encountered the equivalents from various countries over the years in my professional career, getting professional gifts.

607
00:42:41,341 --> 00:42:57,200
Speaker 1: And yeah, I actually had like a coach at my old company who would like help us, help me and help us as a company respond to or proactively do whatever the equivalent culture is in the countries we were doing business in, because this culture is radically different everywhere.

608
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:08,160
Speaker 1: So everything we're talking about is going to be primarily from a US-centric perspective because we're US-ians and really in the forum, like let us know what it's like in your country.

609
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,699
Speaker 1: Like this is I am very interested in that.

610
00:43:11,209 --> 00:43:11,679
Speaker 0: I want to know.

611
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:16,118
Speaker 0: But anyway, so in the US, when I was growing up, I don't know what the history was because I never researched it.

612
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,134
Speaker 0: I'm sure I could look it up.

613
00:43:18,321 --> 00:43:30,002
Speaker 0: But when I was young, basically, if there was a special occasion, usually in accompanying a gift, but not always, not always, you would you would go and buy a card, which is either made by.

614
00:43:30,223 --> 00:43:39,700
Speaker 0: there were basically two companies that sort of have Monopoly, American Greetings and Hallmark and American Greetings, made famous by Penny Arcade and Hallmark, made famous by capitalism.

615
00:43:40,382 --> 00:43:49,460
Speaker 0: And you would go to either a Hallmark store that was like a store that just sold cards and gift shit or, you know, the grocery store, the drugstore.

616
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:52,240
Speaker 0: They always had a section of them, you know, needed one quickly.

617
00:43:52,903 --> 00:43:54,639
Speaker 0: And you'd you'd pick one out.

618
00:43:55,101 --> 00:43:58,659
Speaker 0: And there were all these licensing deals so you could get Snoopy's and Garfield's.

619
00:43:58,881 --> 00:43:59,440
Speaker 1: It was organized.

620
00:44:00,222 --> 00:44:03,560
Speaker 1: And it was always like they were like literally organized by topic alphabetically.

621
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:09,980
Speaker 1: So you're like funeral function, like you're just looking down the list until you find like 40th birthday.

622
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:10,699
Speaker 0: That's the one.

623
00:44:10,941 --> 00:44:11,300
Speaker 0: But right.

624
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:13,460
Speaker 0: So first it's by topic, but then it's by audience.

625
00:44:13,581 --> 00:44:17,420
Speaker 0: It's like, OK, birthday, but is an old person's birthday, a young person's birthday?

626
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,139
Speaker 0: What gender is the person that you're giving the birthday card to?

627
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:24,740
Speaker 0: Or a, you know, a gender neutral one.

628
00:44:25,165 --> 00:44:25,479
Speaker 0: Right.

629
00:44:25,981 --> 00:44:31,140
Speaker 0: Or, you know, is it is it gonna be a funny one or a serious one or a sentimental one?

630
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:36,980
Speaker 0: Or, you know, every different flavor for each event was or circumstance was available.

631
00:44:37,346 --> 00:44:37,597
Speaker 0: Right.

632
00:44:38,749 --> 00:44:39,077
Speaker 0: And then.

633
00:44:39,653 --> 00:44:39,820
Speaker 0: Right.

634
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:42,880
Speaker 0: That there was licensing deals and there were some that weren't licensed.

635
00:44:43,244 --> 00:44:44,598
Speaker 0: Some of them had words in them.

636
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:45,294
Speaker 0: Right.

637
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:45,561
Speaker 0: Like.

638
00:44:45,702 --> 00:44:48,120
Speaker 0: and some of them were just blank and you had to write your own words.

639
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:51,859
Speaker 0: Some of the words are minimal, but you could add your own words in the other space.

640
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,320
Speaker 1: So I don't know about you, but I at least, you know, we talked about this.

641
00:44:55,661 --> 00:44:58,060
Speaker 1: We did all the shows around our childhoods in history.

642
00:44:58,701 --> 00:45:02,200
Speaker 1: I grew up in like like very young childhood Detroit.

643
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:21,499
Speaker 1: But most of my like post kid brain childhood was in the most suburban suburbs to ever grace Midwestern suburbia like pop generic Americana and greeting card like cards like this were such a fixture of life.

644
00:45:21,861 --> 00:45:31,440
Speaker 1: And there were such like specific and simple rules about them that literally like kids would all almost even get the exact same card for their birthday.

645
00:45:31,784 --> 00:45:32,896
Speaker 1: Like as time went on.

646
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:38,378
Speaker 0: Like that's something I didn't notice until more, you know, maybe the past decade or decade and a half.

647
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:38,840
Speaker 0: Right.

648
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:44,580
Speaker 0: Is that the quality of cards and variety of cards back then was much lower.

649
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:44,857
Speaker 0: Right.

650
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:50,440
Speaker 0: Number one, making your own cards was like much more difficult back then.

651
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:53,440
Speaker 0: You know, even if you had a printer, it wasn't a high quality printer.

652
00:45:53,521 --> 00:45:55,820
Speaker 0: You were using Microsoft Publisher and getting some clip art.

653
00:45:56,062 --> 00:45:56,860
Speaker 0: You didn't have Photoshop.

654
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:57,047
Speaker 0: Right.

655
00:45:57,821 --> 00:45:59,819
Speaker 0: You know, now anyone can make any card.

656
00:46:00,443 --> 00:46:02,060
Speaker 0: So computers helped a lot.

657
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:17,518
Speaker 0: There have been a lot of advances in terms of cutting machines that are available to industry as well as home people and basically just, you know, the technology of cards and also, you know, the art of cards, Hallmark and American greetings.

658
00:46:18,049 --> 00:46:18,240
Speaker 0: Right.

659
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:24,300
Speaker 0: We're only making cards and like a certain amount and a certain spread of ideas.

660
00:46:24,361 --> 00:46:24,485
Speaker 0: Right.

661
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,779
Speaker 0: And they were really staying in their lane.

662
00:46:27,301 --> 00:46:41,180
Speaker 0: Whereas once that opened up to other companies, butting in the monopolies long over and people making their own cards, the range of expression on cards expanded, you know, massive.

663
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:53,819
Speaker 1: I've seen in drugstores sections like big congratulations versus just a regular congratulation or like work anniversary versus significant work anniversary, like different levels of condolences.

664
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:59,860
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, I'm talking more like, OK, so there's a company, Papyrus with the overpriced cards or whatever.

665
00:47:00,028 --> 00:47:00,197
Speaker 0: Right.

666
00:47:00,662 --> 00:47:02,520
Speaker 0: I think they might have gotten bought by so I don't know.

667
00:47:02,681 --> 00:47:06,660
Speaker 0: Anyway, but their cards are like extra fancy with like materials.

668
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:07,619
Speaker 0: And right.

669
00:47:08,762 --> 00:47:14,179
Speaker 0: And then you've got some like the love pop ones which came out, which are like these pop up cards.

670
00:47:14,381 --> 00:47:16,720
Speaker 0: And it's like, you know, they're really fancy.

671
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:19,159
Speaker 0: You open it up and like there's a pop up scene.

672
00:47:20,483 --> 00:47:25,328
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, and then the way those have like an insert that you write on and there's no words.

673
00:47:25,368 --> 00:47:26,500
Speaker 0: you have to write everything yourself.

674
00:47:26,668 --> 00:47:26,879
Speaker 0: Right.

675
00:47:27,182 --> 00:47:28,580
Speaker 0: So those are pretty good.

676
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:42,840
Speaker 0: And then, you know, in Astoria here, we've got like, you know, the local, you know, we've got local shops and they've got like some hyper local cards going on right from companies you never even heard of that are like making greeting cards and selling them a whole bunch.

677
00:47:43,322 --> 00:47:47,060
Speaker 0: But only, you know, in in more indie stores.

678
00:47:47,081 --> 00:47:47,210
Speaker 0: Right.

679
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:57,760
Speaker 0: It's like the indie greeting card market, because now the, you know, the technology to make design cards with Photoshop and then print them, you know, got democratized.

680
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:01,798
Speaker 0: You didn't have to have a giant, enormous printing press like Hallmark had in the 80s or whatever.

681
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:06,280
Speaker 0: And, you know, anyone could do it now, but also an Etsy.

682
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:12,100
Speaker 0: You could make you could design a greeting card, go on Etsy, sell it, and people will buy it and use it for their occasions.

683
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:21,660
Speaker 1: You know, so when I was a kid, as a result of, you know, before all of that, there weren't that many different greeting cards and you'd all get the same one.

684
00:48:22,082 --> 00:48:32,820
Speaker 1: And the other thing I always remember is that there were just sort of like these social rules of sending them where you were like as a kid, like we're obligated to send them even if we didn't care about people, like they were just a thing.

685
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:38,240
Speaker 0: Every relative said, well, it's not like you could email someone and phone calls were long distance cost money.

686
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:41,820
Speaker 0: So like, you know, you would send someone, you know, it's like someone's birthday.

687
00:48:42,305 --> 00:48:43,100
Speaker 0: You sent cards.

688
00:48:43,201 --> 00:48:45,059
Speaker 0: If it's your birthday, you got cards.

689
00:48:45,341 --> 00:48:48,420
Speaker 0: You know, but what's interesting now, you just text someone when it's their birthday.

690
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,013
Speaker 1: If I wanted to communicate, I would like.

691
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,559
Speaker 1: back then, I was like, sometimes I would write a letter like that was the thing.

692
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,818
Speaker 1: You know, we're very old.

693
00:48:55,527 --> 00:48:56,540
Speaker 1: I would write letters to people.

694
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,440
Speaker 1: Sometimes people like relatives read letters to us.

695
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:03,980
Speaker 1: We do a phone call, which for was a big deal in the era when long distance was the thing.

696
00:49:04,142 --> 00:49:04,940
Speaker 1: like couldn't call.

697
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:10,138
Speaker 0: People who went on vacation would send you a postcard because it's not like they could call you or anything from there.

698
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:17,340
Speaker 1: I remember when my grandparents were in New Zealand, we we did one phone call with them and it was late at night.

699
00:49:17,441 --> 00:49:19,740
Speaker 1: And that was like the biggest fucking deal.

700
00:49:19,861 --> 00:49:21,580
Speaker 1: Like we're going to do this phone call.

701
00:49:21,682 --> 00:49:22,740
Speaker 1: It's going to be really expensive.

702
00:49:23,142 --> 00:49:26,000
Speaker 0: We just sent postcards when someone was in an island or something.

703
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:36,760
Speaker 1: But what I also what I remember as a result of that is that most of the cards I received and most of the cards I sent, we had and there was I would not write a message in them.

704
00:49:36,942 --> 00:49:37,718
Speaker 1: I would just sign them.

705
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:44,440
Speaker 1: They had a canned message and almost every greeting card I ever received just had a canned message, even within the family.

706
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:59,180
Speaker 1: It was mostly just canned messages, except the handful of people both in the family and just friends and people I knew who were like the greeting card people who would always get a blank one and completely fill it with a letter.

707
00:50:00,304 --> 00:50:01,500
Speaker 1: But that was the exception.

708
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:13,700
Speaker 1: Like there was one on who would do this, one grandma who would do this, the mom of the one friend who would do this, the one family who would get a custom card with their own photos in it and send like the same card to everyone over Christmas.

709
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,660
Speaker 0: Oh, you got to talk about the holiday card thing.

710
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:25,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I noticed, at least in my family, it really dropped off once the Internet started to take off and we started to email each other.

711
00:50:26,281 --> 00:50:31,260
Speaker 1: And there was a period when I just stopped like middle, late middle school.

712
00:50:31,402 --> 00:50:32,840
Speaker 1: I stopped doing cards of any kind.

713
00:50:32,921 --> 00:50:34,120
Speaker 1: I would give no one a card.

714
00:50:34,404 --> 00:50:35,499
Speaker 1: I would only email people.

715
00:50:37,162 --> 00:50:42,316
Speaker 1: And I noticed that I stopped getting cards from anyone who wasn't old around that time as well.

716
00:50:42,862 --> 00:50:48,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, everyone just sends a Facebook, you know, post on their Facebook wall on your birthday or whatever, you know, no one send in a car.

717
00:50:48,401 --> 00:50:50,336
Speaker 1: They started to come back around later.

718
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:56,720
Speaker 1: But I think that's partly an artifact of my less online contacts and less online relatives.

719
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,439
Speaker 1: Like my mom just watches the stream.

720
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,559
Speaker 1: She's really watching this right now.

721
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:04,880
Speaker 1: Like some of my distant friends and family follow me online or we interact online.

722
00:51:05,221 --> 00:51:12,600
Speaker 1: But then there's the subset who aren't as online and I interact with them much more via cards than I do everyone else.

723
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:21,840
Speaker 1: Not that I don't talk to them outside of cards, but those are the people who tend to send and receive cards with me more so than people who are online enough to just text me on like my birthday.

724
00:51:23,134 --> 00:51:23,240
Speaker 0: Yeah.

725
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:31,660
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, the card nowadays is really, you know, when I was a kid, it was common probably because, you know, you're getting birthday gifts constantly, you know, holiday gifts constantly.

726
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,619
Speaker 0: So there's cards attached to them in some way.

727
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:34,166
Speaker 0: Right.

728
00:51:34,741 --> 00:51:38,180
Speaker 0: Or, you know, there's relatives, you know, you don't see or talk with often enough.

729
00:51:38,381 --> 00:51:51,379
Speaker 0: You know, there's a special event, but nowadays it's like, OK, I'm only really using the card and getting the card when it's like a special situation like, OK, I'm coming to your wedding and I'm giving you a gift.

730
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:52,159
Speaker 0: Right.

731
00:51:52,582 --> 00:51:54,680
Speaker 0: And I'm putting the gift in this card.

732
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:55,163
Speaker 0: I can't just.

733
00:51:55,184 --> 00:51:57,320
Speaker 0: it would be weird if I just handed you a check on its own.

734
00:51:57,403 --> 00:51:57,577
Speaker 0: Right.

735
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,359
Speaker 0: So I got to put it in a card.

736
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:00,138
Speaker 0: Right.

737
00:52:00,501 --> 00:52:04,300
Speaker 0: It's almost, you know, or I'm getting you a gift for the holiday.

738
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,183
Speaker 0: I will.

739
00:52:05,424 --> 00:52:10,196
Speaker 0: it would be weird if I just gave you the gift and just a blank just wrapped and that's it.

740
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:14,920
Speaker 0: I have to take a card and tape it to the outside of the package for years now.

741
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,539
Speaker 1: What we've been doing is Emily would do this a lot.

742
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:17,320
Speaker 1: Her family does it.

743
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:26,860
Speaker 1: So we started doing it just generally is if we have a gift, we'll wrap it in some sort of towel, like a nice cloth of some kind and reuse that for future gifts.

744
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,660
Speaker 0: We you know, there's the gift bags for people who don't want to wrap anything.

745
00:52:30,901 --> 00:52:35,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, we we have the gift bags and then we just save them and use them again.

746
00:52:35,542 --> 00:52:36,979
Speaker 1: Yeah, we just use the fancy cloth.

747
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:40,140
Speaker 0: You just put tissue paper to hide what's inside so no one goes to the top.

748
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,520
Speaker 0: And then you next year you just look and you go look in the closet and see if you have a bag that's the right size.

749
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:50,999
Speaker 0: And you know, you only have to use the wrapping paper if it's, you know, a more serious biz deal.

750
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:51,900
Speaker 1: Yeah.

751
00:52:52,540 --> 00:53:11,112
Speaker 1: The other thing I remember is some the holiday cards were a special thing because many families, not every family, not every part of every family, like even in my family orbit, some like a subset of them would send a very long like card that was really just a letter or just really honestly, and

752
00:53:11,172 --> 00:53:12,299
Speaker 0: I don't have anyone who did that.

753
00:53:12,721 --> 00:53:29,720
Speaker 1: We did, but it was mostly that like really disappeared from my entire life around the time that the Internet really took off in that those letters were mostly just like, here's an update on all the things that happened to us because we don't talk often because you live really, really far away.

754
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:32,480
Speaker 0: You don't know because there's no such thing as Facebook.

755
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:41,518
Speaker 0: And the thing as a kid, like the cards that we don't talk on the phone regularly, but I still think of you.

756
00:53:42,081 --> 00:53:45,980
Speaker 1: I always hated the the cards that they made us do in school.

757
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:48,020
Speaker 1: Like, all right, it's Valentine's Day.

758
00:53:48,362 --> 00:53:50,058
Speaker 1: You have to make a card for everyone in your class.

759
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:57,279
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, I thought that I like those because I only like getting the candy that would generally come along with it.

760
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,780
Speaker 0: But you would get the box that was full.

761
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:01,720
Speaker 0: That was designed for school.

762
00:54:02,084 --> 00:54:02,296
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

763
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:04,579
Speaker 1: The one that's like, hey, it's Zelda cards.

764
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:05,520
Speaker 0: Exactly.

765
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:08,700
Speaker 0: And it would you get a cool one like, you know, Ninja Turtles or something.

766
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:15,378
Speaker 1: But I was the nerd who gave the cool Nintendo one and the non nerds thought that stuff was lame as hell.

767
00:54:16,203 --> 00:54:17,580
Speaker 0: I mean, there were enough nerdy people.

768
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:21,280
Speaker 0: I got some good ones and then you got some normal ones to choose, you know, whatever.

769
00:54:21,827 --> 00:54:22,039
Speaker 0: Right.

770
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:24,860
Speaker 0: But, you know, you got it was like getting a goodie bag.

771
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:24,992
Speaker 0: Right.

772
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:25,440
Speaker 0: It was fine.

773
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:25,940
Speaker 0: You know, it's fine.

774
00:54:26,185 --> 00:54:26,980
Speaker 1: One class had a rule.

775
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:32,894
Speaker 1: You had to write something in every card, which was rough because I didn't even know half of these kids and the other half of them.

776
00:54:32,954 --> 00:54:33,820
Speaker 1: I avoided on purpose.

777
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:35,459
Speaker 0: I just wrote Happy Valentine's Day.

778
00:54:37,184 --> 00:54:40,820
Speaker 1: One year in third grade, they were like, it can't just be Happy Valentine's Day.

779
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:41,979
Speaker 1: You have to write something personal.

780
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:43,719
Speaker 0: Whatever.

781
00:54:44,321 --> 00:54:44,857
Speaker 1: I was right.

782
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,139
Speaker 0: I'll write the word something personal.

783
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:46,649
Speaker 0: Yeah.

784
00:54:49,446 --> 00:54:50,179
Speaker 1: I don't remember what I did.

785
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,459
Speaker 1: I remember being mad about it.

786
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:53,685
Speaker 0: Yeah.

787
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:58,099
Speaker 0: Pretty much only use and get the cards in the special occasion times.

788
00:54:58,881 --> 00:55:00,920
Speaker 0: Especially if I have to put money or a check in something.

789
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:04,686
Speaker 0: Or if it's like, yeah, you got to give a gift to the door people at the end of the year.

790
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:05,640
Speaker 0: Super.

791
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:06,280
Speaker 0: Right.

792
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,198
Speaker 0: You put that in a card.

793
00:55:07,491 --> 00:55:07,640
Speaker 0: Right.

794
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:10,935
Speaker 0: You can't just give some Benjamin's like, there you go.

795
00:55:13,424 --> 00:55:13,534
Speaker 0: Right.

796
00:55:14,402 --> 00:55:20,920
Speaker 0: But I think that, you know, the purpose of the cards is not just this sort of physical gift vehicle.

797
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:30,600
Speaker 0: You know, since the letter purpose is, like we said, gone, it's also sort of like this social lubricant for people.

798
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:35,398
Speaker 0: You don't want you feel awkward or you feel uncomfortable, right?

799
00:55:37,562 --> 00:55:40,960
Speaker 0: Expressing heartfelt, you know, sincere heartfelt sentimentality.

800
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:45,065
Speaker 1: Either because that's difficult or because you don't have anything in particular to say.

801
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,698
Speaker 1: There's a lot of reasons that could be the case.

802
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,740
Speaker 0: Like face to face, right?

803
00:55:48,841 --> 00:55:51,160
Speaker 0: Like you're going to go to the doorman, right?

804
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:55,180
Speaker 0: And be like, you know, I really appreciate, you know, you work hard, right?

805
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,839
Speaker 0: You know, you think, you know, I see you here every day.

806
00:55:58,161 --> 00:56:01,899
Speaker 0: You know, my life is a lot better, you know, than it would be if you weren't here.

807
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:02,126
Speaker 0: Right.

808
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:03,439
Speaker 0: You're doing a great job.

809
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:08,100
Speaker 0: You know, imagine, imagine all my packages would be stolen if you didn't come and do this job, right?

810
00:56:08,485 --> 00:56:09,239
Speaker 0: It means a lot to me.

811
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:14,680
Speaker 0: It's like, that would be awkward to actually say that to the doorman, even though it's true.

812
00:56:14,943 --> 00:56:16,360
Speaker 0: And that's what you feel, right?

813
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:25,899
Speaker 0: It's like giving a card is like, aha, a non-awkward way to express those feelings to especially someone you're not super close with.

814
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:28,158
Speaker 0: It's also, if you are close with them, right?

815
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:29,960
Speaker 0: It's, you know, it's very important.

816
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:38,259
Speaker 1: I don't know how long it'll remain this way for people to ping people who are not online in their lives.

817
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:54,219
Speaker 1: Because in fact, like a lot of people you pay, you either have the mutual social media stuff or you use email or some technology to occasionally ping people that you want to stay in touch with, but don't have anything particular to say to like, hey, I recognize that we still know each other, us too.

818
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:57,699
Speaker 1: Like, hey, I point out, I note that you still exist.

819
00:56:58,365 --> 00:56:58,568
Speaker 1: Like.

820
00:56:58,609 --> 00:56:59,260
Speaker 1: I've clicked on you.

821
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:02,480
Speaker 1: I poked you on Facebook or whatever, but not online people.

822
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:06,960
Speaker 1: The card is like the only way to do that because those people aren't going to SMS you.

823
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:07,740
Speaker 1: They're not going to text you.

824
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:08,919
Speaker 0: I don't think there's any such people anymore.

825
00:57:09,561 --> 00:57:11,359
Speaker 1: I still encounter people like that.

826
00:57:11,881 --> 00:57:20,198
Speaker 1: And also those are the people who you don't often necessarily want to call them because you don't have a lot to say to them.

827
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:22,620
Speaker 1: Even if you care about call would be awkward.

828
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:28,899
Speaker 1: Like I said, so the generic card with a little bit like a little note is a really good way to stay in touch with those people.

829
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:31,560
Speaker 0: So let's talk about the thing I mentioned before.

830
00:57:31,689 --> 00:57:31,840
Speaker 0: Right.

831
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:32,659
Speaker 0: The holiday card.

832
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,500
Speaker 0: There is a tradition that I didn't do because we're Jews.

833
00:57:35,709 --> 00:57:35,920
Speaker 0: Right.

834
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:37,083
Speaker 0: But in the

835
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:37,644
Speaker 0: U.S.,

836
00:57:38,406 --> 00:57:46,280
Speaker 0: especially Christmas, people will make a holiday card usually with like a family photo or a pet photo.

837
00:57:46,422 --> 00:57:46,525
Speaker 0: Right.

838
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:57,300
Speaker 0: They'll have them made and they'll send one to literally everyone they know, every family at every other house in their family, every address in their contact list.

839
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:57,465
Speaker 0: Right.

840
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:01,279
Speaker 0: That's someone who is close enough relation to them.

841
00:58:02,664 --> 00:58:06,800
Speaker 1: Everyone had like the one extended family relation who did that.

842
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:07,737
Speaker 1: And you get it every year.

843
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,800
Speaker 0: Like who's the friend, family, coworkers.

844
00:58:10,061 --> 00:58:14,280
Speaker 0: And they would send the card like to everyone, like holiday greetings from our family.

845
00:58:14,773 --> 00:58:14,940
Speaker 0: Right.

846
00:58:15,021 --> 00:58:16,498
Speaker 0: Here's a photo of us this year.

847
00:58:16,861 --> 00:58:16,965
Speaker 0: Right.

848
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,679
Speaker 0: And just, you know, make a huge pile of them, like a little project every year.

849
00:58:21,361 --> 00:58:27,986
Speaker 0: And, you know, on the one hand, it's sort of like, eh, you receive one of those and you're like, eh.

850
00:58:29,321 --> 00:58:34,339
Speaker 0: But on the other hand, it's like if I'm on the sending end, it's like, eh, you know.

851
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:34,788
Speaker 0: Yeah.

852
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:37,620
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, it's all right.

853
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:41,597
Speaker 0: It's like I could have fun doing that, especially, you know, when you're getting creative with it.

854
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:45,880
Speaker 0: Especially nowadays with your photo shops and your printing skills.

855
00:58:46,721 --> 00:58:54,060
Speaker 1: You know, you can make a lot of the artist friends we have do a Chinese New Year card where they put some of their own original art on a card and like do a little thing.

856
00:58:54,680 --> 00:59:03,279
Speaker 0: That's one thing I do know is that in Japan, the manga artists all make a and all the animators, they'll always make like a New Year image.

857
00:59:04,101 --> 00:59:05,380
Speaker 0: They'll draw a New Year's picture.

858
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:11,363
Speaker 0: And I think they, you know, in the past, they may have put it on cards, but now they'll like like.

859
00:59:11,404 --> 00:59:16,840
Speaker 0: I think even like Miyazaki drew a picture and then he just posts it on the posted on social media or whatever.

860
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,699
Speaker 0: Like, here's my New Year's image that I drew.

861
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:19,097
Speaker 1: Yeah.

862
00:59:19,304 --> 00:59:19,433
Speaker 1: Right.

863
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:20,268
Speaker 0: Yeah.

864
00:59:20,562 --> 00:59:21,719
Speaker 0: And that's, you know, that's nice.

865
00:59:22,306 --> 00:59:22,739
Speaker 0: I like that.

866
00:59:24,081 --> 00:59:34,240
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's this industry definitely got largely altered by the fact that technology exists, but it moved in.

867
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:36,200
Speaker 0: It's in a really good place right now.

868
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:37,036
Speaker 0: Yeah.

869
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:40,980
Speaker 1: Apparently, there still are really only two major producers of them in the globe.

870
00:59:41,821 --> 00:59:44,440
Speaker 0: It's still weird that there's still two major producers even.

871
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:52,858
Speaker 1: But like, I think what's happening is most people do not put as much thought into this topic as we just did doing a podcast about it.

872
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:59,340
Speaker 0: So echoing back to the first part of the show, I feel like for the past decade, though, I was like, I haven't bought a Hallmark or an American.

873
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:06,000
Speaker 0: Oh, no, I've ever if I've ever gotten one, it's either been a local indie, you know, one or the the love pop ones.

874
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,479
Speaker 0: I like a lot the pop of ones.

875
01:00:07,908 --> 01:00:08,056
Speaker 1: Yeah.

876
01:00:08,341 --> 01:00:11,800
Speaker 0: Although they may have that company may have been bought by one of the bigger companies.

877
01:00:11,881 --> 01:00:12,377
Speaker 0: I'm not sure.

878
01:00:12,902 --> 01:00:15,940
Speaker 0: But even if they did, I was buying from them when they were still small.

879
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:24,500
Speaker 1: Well, I remember once when I was young, like late middle school, we got Christmas cards from like a family that was friends with our family.

880
01:00:24,881 --> 01:00:31,960
Speaker 1: But it had photos of them in it, which at the time was very expensive and not easy for normal people.

881
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:33,240
Speaker 0: Film photos.

882
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:36,180
Speaker 0: You're going to go to get them developed and print out a whole bunch of them.

883
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,940
Speaker 0: And you can't just see photos on Facebook, right?

884
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:39,825
Speaker 0: It was like that.

885
01:00:42,782 --> 01:00:44,940
Speaker 0: They were they were having this person in months.

886
01:00:45,001 --> 01:00:47,059
Speaker 0: Oh, I can see what they look like now.

887
01:00:47,801 --> 01:00:50,834
Speaker 1: And that was another, you know, another function that disappeared was.

888
01:00:51,337 --> 01:00:54,099
Speaker 1: that was the only way I would see what people who didn't live near us.

889
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:56,600
Speaker 0: I didn't see selfies of them every day on Instagram.

890
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:06,739
Speaker 1: So like I didn't have a digital image of myself that I could do anything with until eighth grade when I scanned a photo of myself in the computer lab at our at in my middle school.

891
01:01:08,043 --> 01:01:09,999
Speaker 1: And then I had that photo on a floppy disk.

892
01:01:12,083 --> 01:01:14,680
Speaker 1: It was like a couple hundred pixels, probably.

893
01:01:15,552 --> 01:01:15,615
Speaker 0: Yep.

894
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:19,980
Speaker 1: And I remember I photoshopped another earring onto my will not photoshopped.

895
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:24,271
Speaker 1: I think I used MS pain to see what an earring would look like to decide if I should get a second earring like.

896
01:01:24,311 --> 01:01:25,039
Speaker 1: that was the extent.

897
01:01:28,463 --> 01:01:29,878
Speaker 1: So, yeah, I think that was a show.

898
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:37,158
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got a. you know, I got a. I basically say every greeting card that I've gotten, I have in a drawer over there.

899
01:01:37,621 --> 01:01:39,160
Speaker 1: But I started drawing old ones.

900
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:40,780
Speaker 1: I keep them for like a year and I purge.

901
01:01:41,002 --> 01:01:41,160
Speaker 0: I don't.

902
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:44,300
Speaker 0: The thing is, I don't have that many because at a certain point they stopped coming.

903
01:01:44,401 --> 01:01:46,619
Speaker 0: So it's like that's all I've ever going to get pretty much.

904
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:49,120
Speaker 1: I think I have a pile of them back at home.

905
01:01:49,421 --> 01:01:50,998
Speaker 1: Like my mom probably has a pile of old ones.

906
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,239
Speaker 0: My mom definitely has a huge pile of them.

907
01:01:53,741 --> 01:01:57,440
Speaker 0: But I've only got the ones that I've received directly since leaving home.

908
01:02:00,066 --> 01:02:01,760
Speaker 0: So and I'm not receiving any more.

909
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:07,180
Speaker 0: And I guess if I have a special event, I can't imagine what special event would result in getting a bunch of cards.

910
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:07,598
Speaker 0: I don't know.

911
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:10,060
Speaker 0: Maybe if I get sick and I get get hopefully that doesn't happen.

912
01:02:10,221 --> 01:02:10,759
Speaker 0: I could get well soon.

913
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:18,780
Speaker 1: I mean, the truest gift for a friend in the modern era is an old copy of EGM, which there are rituals and how that's delivered.

914
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:28,960
Speaker 1: And this has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

925
01:03:28,361 --> 01:03:30,258
Speaker 1: So, uh, yeah, I don't know.

926
01:03:31,021 --> 01:03:35,817
Speaker 1: Let me know what color you want me to make my rim light and I'll change it for the next stream.

927
01:03:35,923 --> 01:03:36,279
Speaker 1: How's that?

928
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:38,673
Speaker 1: I'll see who's actually listening to this stinger for right now.

929
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:40,302
Speaker 1: I simply leave you with Earlier.

930
01:03:40,343 --> 01:03:45,838
Speaker 2: this evening, one of my colleagues from Crossy Isles said, why are we going down this road?

931
01:03:47,621 --> 01:03:48,900
Speaker 2: And there have been similar questions.

932
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:51,520
Speaker 1: Why is this so important?

933
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:54,160
Speaker 2: Why is this bill so important?

934
01:03:55,200 --> 01:04:00,680
Speaker 2: And I'll answer simply this, that dark money corrupts elections.

935
01:04:01,801 --> 01:04:05,015
Speaker 2: If you and I donate more than $200 to a campaign, we are recorded.

936
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:18,160
Speaker 2: But if extraordinarily wealthy individuals donate hundreds of millions of dollars, they can do it with no attribution, corrupting the elections across this country.

937
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:25,580
Speaker 2: Gerrymandering corrupts the system of equal representation.

938
01:04:26,962 --> 01:04:40,920
Speaker 2: From the earliest debates in this chamber, it was recognized that each of us has a stake in the integrity of the elections in other states so that the people of the United States experience equal representation.

939
01:04:42,981 --> 01:04:52,560
Speaker 2: We do not have equal representation in the House today, and the gerrymandering going on now will increase that corruption.

940
01:04:54,161 --> 01:05:06,120
Speaker 2: And third and most importantly, the power to vote is the most significant right guaranteeing each citizen a voice in the direction of our democracy.

941
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:11,960
Speaker 2: It is the soul of what it means to be a democratic republic.

942
01:05:13,641 --> 01:05:20,620
Speaker 2: And that power to vote is also the most important check in our system of checks and balances.

943
01:05:23,011 --> 01:05:31,370
Speaker 2: With rigged elections, leaders leaning towards autocracy can keep themselves in power.

944
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:43,910
Speaker 2: But with fair elections undergirded by a free press, the people can vote out those autocratic leaders who ignore laws and undermine our institutions.

945
01:05:44,971 --> 01:05:52,970
Speaker 2: It's the most important check in maintaining the integrity of our beloved republic.

946
01:05:55,174 --> 01:05:56,229
Speaker 2: Let's go back in time.

947
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:08,040
Speaker 2: The rules of the Senate were forged in the Confederation Congress experience.

948
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:17,205
Speaker 2: Our founders were engaged during the time they were writing our Constitution and participating in the Confederation Congress.

949
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:25,139
Speaker 2: that required a vote of 9 out of 13, two-thirds plus a bit, in order to pass any law.

950
01:06:26,421 --> 01:06:31,100
Speaker 2: And it prevented them from being able to pay the pensions of our veterans.

951
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:35,940
Speaker 2: And it prevented them from raising money for Shea's Rebellion.

952
01:06:37,321 --> 01:06:44,778
Speaker 2: Our founders participating in that process said this supermajority has paralyzed our ability to act.

953
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:53,780
Speaker 2: And with that in mind, they wrote our Constitution so that legislation would be passed by simple majority.

954
01:06:54,660 --> 01:07:10,255
Speaker 2: That at the end of the debate, when all perspectives were duly considered, the perspective favored by the larger number would be accepted rather than the perspective favored by the smaller number.

955
01:07:11,722 --> 01:07:18,403
Speaker 2: And so our founders, leaving nothing to chance, warned us in their writings, "Never adopt a

956
01:07:18,463 --> 01:07:19,573
Speaker 2: supermajority.".

957
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:38,140
Speaker 2: They said, and I will quote James Madison, that when the general good might require new laws, the principle of free government would be reversed.

958
01:07:39,281 --> 01:07:44,900
Speaker 2: It would no longer be the majority that would rule, it would be the power transferred to the minority.

959
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:55,279
Speaker 2: And he went on to say the result would be particular emergencies to extort unreasonable indulgences.

960
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,879
Speaker 2: Hamilton said many similar things.

961
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:15,380
Speaker 2: If a pertinacious minority can control the opinion of the majority, the result will be tedious delays and continual negotiation and intrigue and contemptible compromises.

962
01:08:17,790 --> 01:08:23,569
Speaker 2: He noted the supermajority's real operations to embarrass the administration and destroy the energy of government.

963
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:37,229
Speaker 2: And anyone who has seen the energy drained out of this chamber by nothing happening, day after day after day when we have important issues to face, can understand just how right the founders were.

964
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:47,319
Speaker 2: So in writing up the guidelines and the vision for the initial Senate, our leaders came up with a Senate code.

965
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:50,685
Speaker 2: And that Senate code was here.

966
01:08:50,926 --> 01:08:59,180
Speaker 2: all perspectives, in fact, guaranteed in rule four of the original rules that every senator will have the right to speak twice to a question.

967
01:09:01,501 --> 01:09:13,179
Speaker 2: In addition, they put into the rules a previous question just in case they couldn't get the debate to wrap up so they could get to that all important vote to determine where the greater number stood.

968
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:19,591
Speaker 2: And Thomas Jefferson put into the rule book the manual for the rules.

969
01:09:19,631 --> 01:09:29,520
Speaker 2: in 1801, no one is to speak impertinently or beside the question, superfluously or tediously.

970
01:09:31,990 --> 01:09:39,470
Speaker 2: Hear the debate, consider all perspectives, and take the option the greater number favored.

971
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:49,828
Speaker 2: That Senate code endured in a powerful fashion for a very long time.

972
01:09:51,109 --> 01:10:10,669
Speaker 2: In 1806, Aaron Burr was rewriting the rules and he said, you know, we've never needed to use the previous question rule in the book because we hear everyone, we hear those perspectives, we take a vote, and we go forward, so we don't need the previous question, and it was dropped from the rule book.

973
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:23,770
Speaker 2: And when I hear folks say the Senate never had a simple majority to close debate, they had the Senate code, and they had a rule, and then they said we don't need the rule because we have the Senate code.

974
01:10:25,051 --> 01:10:29,873
Speaker 2: And that code continued to endure, which the full understanding of the members of this chamber was.

975
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:33,370
Speaker 2: they had no right to prevent the Senate from getting to a final vote.

976
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:50,280
Speaker 2: That code was so powerful that in the mid-1800s, when senators started to speak at length in order to make it very difficult to get to a final vote, the press called it piracy.

977
01:10:52,161 --> 01:10:56,499
Speaker 2: You may wonder, where did that term filibuster come from?

978
01:10:58,982 --> 01:11:03,640
Speaker 2: That term is a corruption of the term freebooter, the term for piracy.

979
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:08,580
Speaker 2: The piracy was senators breaking the Senate code.

980
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:10,700
Speaker 2: That was the piracy.

981
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:24,380
Speaker 2: But still, it happened on rare occasion, and the code was stretched, but not really broken through the 1800s, except on civil rights.

982
01:11:25,602 --> 01:11:28,140
Speaker 2: And what happened in our history on civil rights?

983
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:39,360
Speaker 2: Well, you had John C. Calhoun leading the nullification movement that said, hey, states don't have to accept any given federal law.

984
01:11:40,221 --> 01:11:42,359
Speaker 2: They can choose and pick which ones they want.

985
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:57,959
Speaker 2: And initially, that nullification movement was in order to block laws that put tariffs on imported products that strengthened the North and cost more funds to the South, increased the prices of goods.

986
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:10,998
Speaker 2: But then it turned to the question of protecting slavery, and nullification continued and even went so far as to say states should have the right to succeed if they don't like those federal laws.

987
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:16,960
Speaker 2: And then we had a civil war over that question, and that was the end of nullification.

988
01:12:18,602 --> 01:12:22,240
Speaker 2: But it was not the end of attack on civil rights.

989
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,059
Speaker 2: So what did we see after the Civil War?

990
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:31,280
Speaker 2: We saw a group of states make it harder for individuals to register to vote.

991
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:38,840
Speaker 2: We saw a group of states make it hard for black Americans to get public accommodations.

992
01:12:40,421 --> 01:12:49,256
Speaker 2: We saw a group of states make it easier to re-enslave black Americans under the black codes utilizing the slavery clause of the 13th amendment.

993
01:12:51,801 --> 01:12:53,180
Speaker 2: And Congress responded.

994
01:12:54,721 --> 01:12:56,040
Speaker 2: The House responded.

995
01:12:57,080 --> 01:13:07,300
Speaker 2: This Senate responded and said, no, we are here to defend the Constitution, that every person is created equal, and every person's rights must be protected.

996
01:13:07,421 --> 01:13:13,562
Speaker 2: That's what this chamber of the Senate did in 1875.

997
01:13:13,562 --> 01:13:22,260
Speaker 2: The House passed the Civil Rights Act on public accommodations, guaranteeing access to all public accommodations for all Americans.

998
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:33,700
Speaker 2: The House voted 152 to 99, and it came to the Senate, and the Senate voted 38-26, simple majority.

999
01:13:35,150 --> 01:13:55,780
Speaker 2: Although there were senators here who desperately hated public accommodation bills, because it would end discrimination in the South, they did not filibuster because the Senate code said after all views are heard, you can hold a simple majority vote.

1000
01:13:58,552 --> 01:13:59,249
Speaker 2: The Senate code held.

1001
01:14:00,510 --> 01:14:03,991
Speaker 2: But it didn't hold in 1891.

1002
01:14:03,991 --> 01:14:13,921
Speaker 2: In 1890, Henry Cabot Lodge, down the hall in the House, introduced what became known as the Lodge Bill, and it said, in order to protect the foundation of

1003
01:14:14,863 --> 01:14:16,426
Speaker 0: our nation, there

1004
01:14:18,170 --> 01:14:27,009
Speaker 2: can be federal supervision upon request to make sure registration is fair, to make sure the voting process is fair, and to make sure the counting process is fair.

1005
01:14:28,291 --> 01:14:52,370
Speaker 2: And the bill came here to the Senate, and a bipartisan group filibustered that bill of Southern Democrats and Western senators known as the Silver Senators, and they were anxious to get on to a bill about silver coinage, support the silver mining in the West, and that bill was eventually tabled.

1006
01:14:52,370 --> 01:15:01,850
Speaker 2: 1891, the Senate code was broken on civil rights and continued to be broken through.

1007
01:15:01,850 --> 01:15:09,770
Speaker 2: 1922, the Dyer Anti-Lynching Act, it was filibustered.

1008
01:15:09,770 --> 01:15:15,130
Speaker 2: 1934, the Cossack and Wagner Anti-Lynching Act, it was filibustered.

1009
01:15:15,130 --> 01:15:22,869
Speaker 2: 1942, the anti-poll tax bill that put a price on being able to access the ballot box, it was filibustered.

1010
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:24,023
Speaker 2: And on and on.

1011
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:48,210
Speaker 2: With the exception of a one-week delay in a bill for arming commercial ships in 1917, virtually every filibuster was to deny black Americans the right to vote, because in lieu of nullification, there had to be a strategy for certain senators to make sure that black Americans didn't get their civil rights.

1012
01:15:48,771 --> 01:15:53,890
Speaker 2: That is the sorry chapter of that part of our American history.

1013
01:15:56,860 --> 01:15:59,991
Speaker 2: Three generations through 1965 paid the price of denied opportunities.

1014
01:16:05,001 --> 01:16:08,895
Speaker 2: The Senate code on every other issue essentially survived until 1971 within our lifetimes.

1015
01:16:08,895 --> 01:16:19,657
Speaker 2: 1975, '71, we started to see the filibuster go to not just one or two filibusters a year, but to 12, a dozen, imagine that.

1016
01:16:21,881 --> 01:16:42,080
Speaker 2: And 1974 to '32, and that was just so outrageous, because each one takes up a week, and so this Senate said that is unacceptable, so we must reform the rules, and it led to the March 1975 rule reform where they went from two-thirds of those voting to 60 members voting.

1017
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:46,560
Speaker 2: Well, the result is that law backfired.

1018
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:57,729
Speaker 2: To quickly look at it, cloture on amendments, each one taking up a week, expanded from some six times an entire decade in the 1960s to 143 times in the 2010s.

1019
01:17:01,481 --> 01:17:05,580
Speaker 2: From motion to proceed, which is the ability to prevent debate from ever happening.

1020
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:11,280
Speaker 2: So the filibuster promote debate was used to kill debate on the motion to proceed.

1021
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:14,047
Speaker 2: It was used ten times in the 1960s, 175 times in the 2010s.

1022
01:17:19,061 --> 01:17:22,228
Speaker 2: And on nominations, it went from once in the 1960s to 545 times in the 2010s.

1023
01:17:28,182 --> 01:17:30,314
Speaker 2: And how did it happen that it expanded in the 2010s?

1024
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:49,460
Speaker 2: Well, it happened because the Republican majority, Republican minority, decided that they were going to obstruct as many of President Obama's nominations as possible.

1025
01:17:51,262 --> 01:17:53,640
Speaker 2: And the Democrats did the same thing to President Trump.

1026
01:17:55,701 --> 01:18:02,174
Speaker 2: Each one of these takes up a week, an intervening day, 30 hours of debate, another hour of debate for every other senator who wants to speak.

1027
01:18:02,194 --> 01:18:02,839
Speaker 2: who didn't get to.

1028
01:18:03,343 --> 01:18:04,040
Speaker 2: Every single one.

1029
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:10,220
Speaker 2: So when you have over 100 of these a year, it is impossible to have a Senate that works.

1030
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:12,420
Speaker 2: The Senate has been broken.

1031
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:25,590
Speaker 2: And perhaps the top champion of breaking the Senate is a minority leader who has engaged in the tactic of delaying obstruction, arguing.

1032
01:18:25,751 --> 01:18:38,640
Speaker 2: he wanted to make sure his top priority was making sure President Obama was never reelected and stopping him from having an agenda and stopping him from putting people into office was the strategy.

1033
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:44,560
Speaker 2: And Democrats took much the same approach to President Trump.

1034
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:48,059
Speaker 2: So we have both done it, but the Senate is blowing up now.

1035
01:18:50,421 --> 01:19:00,720
Speaker 2: You know, that original Congress, the Senate, first term, it said there were about four cabinet members to confirm, plus ambassadors and some judges, four.

1036
01:19:01,141 --> 01:19:02,172
Speaker 2: We have over 1,000 positions now.

1037
01:19:03,462 --> 01:19:04,640
Speaker 2: It's completely out of sync.

1038
01:19:05,001 --> 01:19:06,018
Speaker 2: The gears don't match.

1039
01:19:07,421 --> 01:19:11,420
Speaker 2: And every time there's a filibuster or a nomination, it's another week lost.

1040
01:19:12,051 --> 01:19:14,320
Speaker 2: So the Senate is now paralyzed.

1041
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:22,638
Speaker 2: Because here is the interesting prospect and the unfortunate reality of 60 votes.

1042
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:30,479
Speaker 2: The interesting prospect is that a majority of less than 60 has to reach out to the minority to get something done.

1043
01:19:31,341 --> 01:19:34,520
Speaker 2: And that sounds like it's going to increase cooperation and negotiation.

1044
01:19:35,581 --> 01:19:49,139
Speaker 2: But the unfortunate reality in our tribal partisan politics is the minority looks at that and says, if we can hold 41 senators from agreeing to close debate, we can paralyze the majority.

1045
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:58,440
Speaker 2: That is the overwhelming impact is paralysis and accentuation of partisanship of our current filibuster.

1046
01:20:03,490 --> 01:20:07,530
Speaker 2: Today's debate, it's not about a filibuster versus no filibuster.

1047
01:20:09,354 --> 01:20:11,190
Speaker 2: It's about fixing a broken Senate.

1048
01:20:12,670 --> 01:20:23,230
Speaker 2: It's about the difference, as my colleague from Virginia has said, from the secret no show filibuster to the public talking filibuster.

1049
01:20:24,650 --> 01:20:30,467
Speaker 2: Before 1975, people who wanted to extend debate had to actually debate.

1050
01:20:30,848 --> 01:20:32,426
Speaker 2: what a notion they had to show up.

1051
01:20:33,590 --> 01:20:37,390
Speaker 2: And that is painful and difficult to maintain continuous debate.

1052
01:20:39,110 --> 01:20:40,910
Speaker 2: And so there's an incentive to negotiate.

1053
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:54,650
Speaker 2: But when there's a no show, no effort filibuster where those who say they want to debate are off on vacation because 60 votes is required with or without them, there's no incentive to negotiate.

1054
01:20:55,530 --> 01:21:05,510
Speaker 2: So if you believe the Senate should be a place that encourages negotiation, we need a public filibuster, not a secret, silent filibuster.

1055
01:21:07,110 --> 01:21:18,650
Speaker 2: If you believe that the public should be able to participate in our process, we need not a secret, silent filibuster, but a public filibuster.

1056
01:21:19,470 --> 01:21:25,670
Speaker 2: We're here, day after day, week after week, we're debating the issue, we're raising amendments, we're considering amendments.

1057
01:21:26,372 --> 01:21:27,370
Speaker 2: And what is the result?

1058
01:21:27,650 --> 01:21:30,349
Speaker 2: The citizens weigh in, they say finally they're considering it.

1059
01:21:30,754 --> 01:21:31,849
Speaker 2: Finally, they're debating it.

1060
01:21:32,230 --> 01:21:33,450
Speaker 2: Finally, they're going to take a debate.

1061
01:21:33,851 --> 01:21:37,210
Speaker 2: Now we can weigh in effectively in this moment.

1062
01:21:38,170 --> 01:21:55,750
Speaker 2: So this is about restoring, reinvigorating debate, restoring the public role, creating an incentive to negotiate, creating an incentive for both sides to work to reach an accommodation.

1063
01:21:57,292 --> 01:22:11,880
Speaker 2: Now, my Republican friends have made much today of Democrats signing a letter saying that they are determined to, quote, preserve the ability of members to engage in extended debate -- interesting.

1064
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:15,080
Speaker 2: Preserve the ability of members to engage in extended debate.

1065
01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:27,160
Speaker 2: The ability to preserve the ability to engage in extended debate means we need the talking public filibuster, not the secret, silent filibuster, which requires no debate at all.

1066
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:43,960
Speaker 2: So to my Republican colleagues who signed this letter, this is your opportunity to do what you said -- vote for the principle that the majority leader is going to be laying out forthwith.

1067
01:22:48,960 --> 01:23:26,940
Speaker 2: So colleagues, if you believe in the Founders' vision of this Senate, of hearing everyone and hearing everyone well, but eventually getting to a final vote, if you believe in the Senate code, which stood up for so long, not even needing a rule to enforce it, except for civil rights, it held up through 1971, if you want more debate, and you want people who want to debate to have to show up to debate, support the talking filibuster.

1068
01:23:28,965 --> 01:23:34,520
Speaker 2: If you believe there should be an incentive for both the majority and the minority to negotiate, support the talking filibuster.

1069
01:23:36,301 --> 01:23:43,440
Speaker 2: If you believe the public should have the ability to see us debating issues, then support the talking filibuster.

1070
01:23:45,441 --> 01:23:50,500
Speaker 2: And my colleagues have said we must defend the minority leverage.

1071
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:51,960
Speaker 2: Amen to that.

1072
01:23:52,120 --> 01:24:03,860
Speaker 2: That is why in 2011 I put forward in this chamber the talking filibuster and said we need to defend the minority's right to participate.

1073
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:16,920
Speaker 2: Today we have another opportunity to defend the minority's participation, to speak at length for at least twice on any given question on through a complex bill.

1074
01:24:18,301 --> 01:24:33,540
Speaker 2: But that, colleagues, depends upon ending the era of the secret, silent source of partisanship and paralysis that we currently have and replacing it with the talking public filibuster.

1075
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:46,719
Speaker 2: I encourage you all to stand today for the Senate to work and for the Senate, most importantly, to defend the fundamental rights of every American to access the ballot box.
