1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:12,623
Speaker 1: It's Thursday September 28th 2017.

2
00:00:12,623 --> 00:00:13,104
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:16,053
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:16,515 --> 00:00:18,180
Speaker 1: We're talking about desks.

5
00:00:20,382 --> 00:00:21,397
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:28,193
Speaker 0: So on Saturday, I was biking around looking for sports to photograph.

7
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:28,614
Speaker 0: Whatever.

8
00:00:28,634 --> 00:00:29,617
Speaker 0: Yeah.

9
00:00:29,657 --> 00:00:30,780
Speaker 1: What was I doing on Saturday?

10
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,555
Speaker 1: I went biking on so I went for a run.

11
00:00:32,634 --> 00:00:33,180
Speaker 1: on Saturday.

12
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:38,166
Speaker 0: I came across some roller hockey and the thing is I started taking photos the roll hockey But then it ended.

13
00:00:38,206 --> 00:00:39,676
Speaker 0: it was the third period of the last game.

14
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:52,853
Speaker 0: Ah So I barely I got like me not even any photos But that roller hockey was way like serious competitive intense like they didn't have a name for the league But like it was super organized and like this one guy running.

15
00:00:52,893 --> 00:00:54,438
Speaker 0: It was the most New York guy I ever seen.

16
00:00:55,841 --> 00:00:57,670
Speaker 0: So he's I said when should I come back?

17
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,720
Speaker 0: He says they play Saturday morning and Wednesday night.

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,408
Speaker 0: So I'm like, oh I got nothing else to do Wednesday night.

19
00:01:01,569 --> 00:01:03,880
Speaker 0: That sounds more productive than sitting on my ass at home.

20
00:01:04,504 --> 00:01:15,504
Speaker 0: so I went over there and Basically, they play short games like it's still three periods, but they're short maybe five ten-minute periods that makes and there's no stopping for Commercials, there's.

21
00:01:15,544 --> 00:01:17,271
Speaker 0: no it doesn't look there's any hitting any time.

22
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:19,419
Speaker 0: I saw anyone handy when there was a penalty, right?

23
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,760
Speaker 1: So the reason that makes sense is when I played roller hockey as a kid The one thing that was very apparent is that you never had enough kids for line.

24
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,884
Speaker 1: So you were basically on.

25
00:01:26,924 --> 00:01:30,054
Speaker 0: the one team had no subs, but they like kicked ass.

26
00:01:30,235 --> 00:01:31,760
Speaker 0: one team had like two subs.

27
00:01:32,782 --> 00:01:33,625
Speaker 0: They were like borrowing.

28
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:36,458
Speaker 0: they had goalies that were like like hey, does anyone want to stick around?

29
00:01:36,498 --> 00:01:38,025
Speaker 0: we're short We need a goalie.

30
00:01:38,046 --> 00:01:41,040
Speaker 1: so I'm curious because I've seen two styles of air hockey.

31
00:01:42,482 --> 00:01:43,547
Speaker 0: Roller hockey did.

32
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:46,420
Speaker 1: were the goalies also wearing rollerblades or they just have shoes?

33
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,073
Speaker 0: Oh, the goalies are wearing rollerblades, but they all said full goalie equipment.

34
00:01:50,093 --> 00:01:55,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got a Playing with a plastic puck or the ball.

35
00:01:55,361 --> 00:01:56,564
Speaker 0: It was a plastic puck.

36
00:01:56,745 --> 00:02:03,005
Speaker 0: on the surface at this rink is some kind of plastic surface, but oh, okay I know I know what kind of it was like.

37
00:02:03,126 --> 00:02:07,180
Speaker 0: it was like these plastic tiles, but man, they were flying like whoa.

38
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:07,741
Speaker 0: It was like.

39
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:13,919
Speaker 0: you didn't even realize it wasn't ice hockey, you know, obviously not NHL speed but like damn so modern.

40
00:02:14,661 --> 00:02:19,313
Speaker 0: They were even keeping track of like who got the assists and stuff.

41
00:02:19,894 --> 00:02:34,878
Speaker 0: modern and rollerblades are Dangerous linesman refs the whole deal, but they were just like the teams were like so shoddy like six dudes roll up And they're like they're putting their clothes on right next to the as the other team is finishing up.

42
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,805
Speaker 1: and Scott Let's form a team and join the league.

43
00:02:36,926 --> 00:02:37,709
Speaker 0: We would die.

44
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,271
Speaker 0: Also.

45
00:02:38,351 --> 00:02:40,097
Speaker 0: I can't skate of any any kind.

46
00:02:40,218 --> 00:02:41,827
Speaker 1: I could teach you That's not that hard.

47
00:02:42,109 --> 00:02:43,620
Speaker 0: I cannot skate anyway.

48
00:02:44,705 --> 00:02:45,660
Speaker 0: So that was kind of awesome.

49
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:53,466
Speaker 0: If anyone wants to do roller hockey I suggest going to Brooklyn Bridge Park Wednesday night or Saturday morning and you know You can definitely play some.

50
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,540
Speaker 0: but it was serious and competitive like they were keeping score on paper.

51
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:01,419
Speaker 0: They said they play The whole year no matter what the temperature is no matter what?

52
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, right as long as it's not raining because apparently the roof there is kind of leaky.

53
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:10,315
Speaker 0: But it was lit up at night and also the random fireworks.

54
00:03:10,656 --> 00:03:13,587
Speaker 1: were they Checking or no checking.

55
00:03:13,929 --> 00:03:14,390
Speaker 0: No like that.

56
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,394
Speaker 0: No one is hitting anyone.

57
00:03:15,514 --> 00:03:15,875
Speaker 1: Okay.

58
00:03:15,976 --> 00:03:16,317
Speaker 1: Okay.

59
00:03:16,377 --> 00:03:21,480
Speaker 1: I said that already but When you say I assumed that was like they're not fighting and so it was no fun.

60
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,029
Speaker 0: there was no fighting either but there was.

61
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,898
Speaker 0: there was like a great deal of a Verbal assaults.

62
00:03:28,521 --> 00:03:28,919
Speaker 0: Anyway.

63
00:03:30,121 --> 00:03:36,390
Speaker 0: Also, just the tiny news right at the office today They gave out free flu shots to everybody who wanted one.

64
00:03:36,811 --> 00:03:42,333
Speaker 1: Oh my old company two companies ago Used to do that and three companies ago was the hospital.

65
00:03:42,373 --> 00:03:43,639
Speaker 1: So they of course also did that.

66
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:48,360
Speaker 0: But anyway, we had to wait in line like everyone's waiting in line for that goes with one person giving out shots.

67
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:58,600
Speaker 0: Everyone's waiting in line, but I just want to say anyone out there Blue shot if you I mean first of all, we all know the way the flu shot works.

68
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,359
Speaker 0: Is that the smart doctors I assume CDC doctors or someone else?

69
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:03,742
Speaker 0: Figures out.

70
00:04:03,822 --> 00:04:04,224
Speaker 0: Hmm.

71
00:04:04,364 --> 00:04:08,359
Speaker 0: These strains of flu are probably gonna be making the most evil this year.

72
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:13,976
Speaker 0: Let's get dead ones of those and put them in this here vaccine and test it.

73
00:04:14,116 --> 00:04:15,460
Speaker 0: and that's the flu shot for this year.

74
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,507
Speaker 0: And that's how it works.

75
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:20,430
Speaker 0: right and every year is different Which means if they're wrong?

76
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,157
Speaker 0: Yeah, you might still get the flu.

77
00:04:22,337 --> 00:04:25,146
Speaker 0: It's possible Right, but it doesn't matter.

78
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:30,300
Speaker 0: right you want to go back to the day when like the flu killed millions of people?

79
00:04:30,802 --> 00:04:34,174
Speaker 0: No, no, you don't and that's why you should go get jabbed.

80
00:04:34,415 --> 00:04:35,860
Speaker 0: It's like oh no you got jabbed.

81
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, even if it hurts and even if it sucks and even if you're a big baby you pass out.

82
00:04:40,921 --> 00:04:43,568
Speaker 0: Would you rather have millions of people die from the horrible flu?

83
00:04:43,588 --> 00:04:43,629
Speaker 0: No.

84
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:48,654
Speaker 1: Well, it's even more important that even if you're just selfish You don't care about other people.

85
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:58,890
Speaker 1: Getting the flu shot reduces your chance of getting the flu and has almost no consequences for you and likely no Consequences other than possibly avoiding the flu.

86
00:04:58,910 --> 00:04:58,950
Speaker 1: if

87
00:04:59,793 --> 00:04:59,893
Speaker 0: you

88
00:04:59,913 --> 00:05:03,226
Speaker 1: haven't had a legit flu in a while Like if you've had cold haven't

89
00:05:03,246 --> 00:05:04,350
Speaker 0: had one in like so long

90
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:05,936
Speaker 1: and you forget I haven't

91
00:05:05,956 --> 00:05:06,980
Speaker 0: even been sick in so long

92
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:15,439
Speaker 1: the actually if you have an actual influenza it is Way worse than you probably remember it being if you haven't had it in a

93
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:15,660
Speaker 0: while.

94
00:05:15,922 --> 00:05:18,940
Speaker 0: Also is that when you're an adult right?

95
00:05:19,322 --> 00:05:21,390
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Getting sick is way worse than getting like.

96
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:25,032
Speaker 0: when I got sick as a kid like I felt bad But like I was kind of happy.

97
00:05:25,354 --> 00:05:26,120
Speaker 1: I never go to school.

98
00:05:26,361 --> 00:05:31,220
Speaker 0: I mean not to go to school, but also it didn't feel so bad that like I minded too much.

99
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,700
Speaker 0: Well, here's so I could still like, you know watch prices right and play Nintendo like fine.

100
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:41,472
Speaker 0: If I get sick now with the same sickness, I'm like, it's the same thing with falling Like if I fall I like.

101
00:05:41,513 --> 00:05:43,565
Speaker 0: when I was a kid I fell down the stairs.

102
00:05:43,585 --> 00:05:54,039
Speaker 0: as my memory tells me I fell down the stairs on numerous occasions Yeah and jumped off of like porches that were you know a story above the ground with no problem whatsoever.

103
00:05:54,059 --> 00:05:57,333
Speaker 0: and I think about doing that now and it's like I would just die.

104
00:05:57,353 --> 00:05:59,324
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember one time as a kid I was just in my bedroom.

105
00:05:59,344 --> 00:06:02,500
Speaker 0: If I fell down a stair like a few stairs right now, I'd probably blink a bone.

106
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:08,023
Speaker 1: I was in my bedroom and I just was like looking out the window and then my kid brain was just like you could totally Make it.

107
00:06:08,064 --> 00:06:15,117
Speaker 1: I just fucking jumped out of the second story Landed down in like the garden and then I knocked on the front door and my parents like what the fuck?

108
00:06:15,318 --> 00:06:17,804
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Getting sick is the same thing.

109
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,289
Speaker 0: It's way worse when you're an adult.

110
00:06:19,429 --> 00:06:20,613
Speaker 0: So get it.

111
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:24,611
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz kids with shitty immune systems they can't be getting a flu shot that'll give them flu.

112
00:06:24,672 --> 00:06:30,420
Speaker 1: but the main difference between the Like I'll just be in sick and having the flu is when you're just sick and you stay home from work.

113
00:06:30,883 --> 00:06:33,059
Speaker 1: You'll just sit there and play video games and feel shitty.

114
00:06:33,682 --> 00:06:38,160
Speaker 1: Well the last time I had a legit flu I couldn't hurt too much to play a video game.

115
00:06:38,341 --> 00:06:40,013
Speaker 0: You can't go take photos of roller hockey.

116
00:06:40,073 --> 00:06:41,399
Speaker 1: No, you're gonna sit well.

117
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:53,666
Speaker 1: so Emily came home while I had that flu like I Didn't go to work and she went to work and she comes home and I was apparently I don't remember this that while I was Sitting in the living room and all the lights are off The TV wasn't on.

118
00:06:53,686 --> 00:07:00,577
Speaker 1: it was just silent and I was hunched over Sitting upright with a blanket covering me like a shroud not moving and I didn't react.

119
00:07:00,617 --> 00:07:01,480
Speaker 1: when she came home.

120
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,152
Speaker 1: Yeah, she was like, are you okay?

121
00:07:04,252 --> 00:07:07,843
Speaker 1: And I was like no no Obviously not.

122
00:07:08,144 --> 00:07:09,088
Speaker 1: you want to go to bed?

123
00:07:09,148 --> 00:07:11,075
Speaker 1: and I was like it hurts too much.

124
00:07:11,537 --> 00:07:12,380
Speaker 0: go to the hospital.

125
00:07:13,802 --> 00:07:15,229
Speaker 1: Thing is I had a flu and I'm an adult.

126
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:15,712
Speaker 1: I'm healthy.

127
00:07:15,994 --> 00:07:20,526
Speaker 1: The hospital wasn't gonna do anything Depends it was just a flu.

128
00:07:20,546 --> 00:07:23,659
Speaker 0: They might have been able to tell you like maybe you're dehydrated didn't realize it.

129
00:07:24,482 --> 00:07:25,648
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm pretty on top of that.

130
00:07:25,728 --> 00:07:26,814
Speaker 0: I could think IV you.

131
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:30,666
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Morphine that'll make you feel better.

132
00:07:30,766 --> 00:07:31,611
Speaker 0: get sleep right away.

133
00:07:31,631 --> 00:07:33,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, they give me the morphine for that.

134
00:07:33,781 --> 00:07:35,348
Speaker 1: I probably not.

135
00:07:35,408 --> 00:07:36,895
Speaker 0: I feel like tell them how it hurts.

136
00:07:37,035 --> 00:07:37,297
Speaker 0: It hurts.

137
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:47,076
Speaker 1: All I got to ten Man when I got the food poisoning that one time in New York That was an eight that like that was the number I told them.

138
00:07:47,137 --> 00:07:49,775
Speaker 1: on that scale I think that was the worst pain I've ever experienced in my life.

139
00:07:49,795 --> 00:07:58,694
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Yeah In some news, you probably noticed that some people are tweeting entire essays.

140
00:07:58,775 --> 00:08:00,965
Speaker 0: now This is my news.

141
00:08:00,985 --> 00:08:02,854
Speaker 1: you stole it, okay, I introduced it.

142
00:08:02,894 --> 00:08:04,100
Speaker 1: you can just know it's Scott's news.

143
00:08:04,361 --> 00:08:22,613
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Twitter which can't do anything right ever except I guess do the bare minimum to keep itself from dying completely and have enough momentum that people can't abandon and even though there's better things out there has Decided that some people are gonna be able to tweet 280 instead of 140 characters.

144
00:08:22,673 --> 00:08:23,876
Speaker 1: eventually everyone will.

145
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,220
Speaker 0: I guess I can't but whatever.

146
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:27,284
Speaker 1: Well, you can.

147
00:08:27,324 --> 00:08:28,909
Speaker 1: there is a way for anyone.

148
00:08:28,929 --> 00:08:29,873
Speaker 0: it's on the one right.

149
00:08:29,953 --> 00:08:36,488
Speaker 0: on the one hand this is Annoying because I feel like people are gonna be.

150
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:38,816
Speaker 0: I'm already pissed off when people tweet a thread.

151
00:08:39,197 --> 00:08:43,600
Speaker 0: if you want to tweet a Thread what you should be doing is writing a blog post and tweeting a link to the blog post.

152
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,848
Speaker 0: That's what you should be fucking doing.

153
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:46,780
Speaker 0: Don't give me this thread bullshit, right?

154
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,240
Speaker 0: The whole point of Twitter is that you can say everything you need to say in less.

155
00:08:51,162 --> 00:08:58,658
Speaker 0: There have been many occasions where I myself I'm making a tweet and there is literally no way to include everything I want to include and it.

156
00:08:58,678 --> 00:09:08,259
Speaker 0: you know I take out all the cruft and I can't get it in 140 because I'm including like a link and an image and Three hashtags plus the description of what it is, right and that just doesn't fit.

157
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:19,365
Speaker 0: so it's nice to get the 280 for those rare cases, but Letting everyone 280 all the freaking time is like oh people are just gonna write a bunch of useless crap and that now they had The space they're gonna fill it in.

158
00:09:19,406 --> 00:09:20,149
Speaker 0: that's what people do.

159
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you give them an inch you can take a mile, right?

160
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,580
Speaker 1: So is at least in English 140 felt like I was a pretty good number.

161
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:34,760
Speaker 0: This is this is not something that will improve Twitter and it's it's very disparaging because at the same time are discouraging.

162
00:09:34,961 --> 00:09:35,824
Speaker 0: Yeah, not despair.

163
00:09:35,884 --> 00:09:37,370
Speaker 1: I'm going to disparage it.

164
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:37,671
Speaker 0: Yes.

165
00:09:37,752 --> 00:09:37,993
Speaker 0: I did.

166
00:09:38,113 --> 00:09:44,999
Speaker 0: It's because I am discouraged by Discouraging because there are things Twitter should be doing that they could do.

167
00:09:45,603 --> 00:09:47,656
Speaker 0: That I guess would be more work than doing this.

168
00:09:47,696 --> 00:09:55,026
Speaker 0: to do this all you got to do is change like one number in the code and press enter right, but The things you want them to do they know.

169
00:09:55,066 --> 00:09:56,029
Speaker 1: do what I want to do.

170
00:09:56,049 --> 00:09:57,333
Speaker 0: I want rid of Nazis.

171
00:09:57,394 --> 00:09:58,357
Speaker 1: get rid of Nazis.

172
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,831
Speaker 1: Uh, That's pretty much number one.

173
00:10:00,872 --> 00:10:01,599
Speaker 0: That's pretty much it.

174
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,118
Speaker 0: Yeah Get rid of threads.

175
00:10:03,682 --> 00:10:09,645
Speaker 0: make people tweet a link to a blog post if someone wants to write something because the threads don't get in my way because Usually the ones.

176
00:10:09,946 --> 00:10:11,210
Speaker 0: but the thing is people are writing.

177
00:10:11,271 --> 00:10:11,853
Speaker 0: actually I'm not.

178
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:18,100
Speaker 0: the thing is the content in most throughout Angle is high quality content that I do want to read.

179
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,637
Speaker 0: It just really sucks to read that content when in Twitter thread form, right?

180
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:29,120
Speaker 1: Regardless of which Twitter reader you use especially when they mess it up and like their thread turns into two threads, right?

181
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:44,925
Speaker 0: It's like let force give people of something where if they go over the 140 what it should do is it you turn their tweet It's like a link with it with a short description That's under 140 and then that link take you to a page that has the whole fucking essay written out somewhere Like a blog post.

182
00:10:45,026 --> 00:10:47,560
Speaker 1: I feel like normal people just don't write blogs anymore.

183
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:52,000
Speaker 0: They just I mean, yeah people aren't gonna start a WordPress just so they can do this, right?

184
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,703
Speaker 0: Well, you have to.

185
00:10:52,743 --> 00:10:53,386
Speaker 1: I would I should yeah.

186
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:54,993
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what you should do.

187
00:10:55,053 --> 00:11:00,976
Speaker 0: But uh, the Twitter should provide the long blog because Twitter was originally called microblogging.

188
00:11:00,996 --> 00:11:02,040
Speaker 0: No one calls it that anymore.

189
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:05,660
Speaker 0: You need to provide the macro blog to go with the microblog, right?

190
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,660
Speaker 0: And not everyone has a tumblr WordPress or medium or whatever it is to do this.

191
00:11:11,562 --> 00:11:16,000
Speaker 0: Provide something for the people who are only tweeting so that they can tweet a long essay.

192
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,029
Speaker 0: I feel like making more than one tweet.

193
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:25,920
Speaker 1: hosting content on the internet has had this Like this dichotomy that's only increased over time where there's two completely separate classes of people.

194
00:11:26,301 --> 00:11:33,628
Speaker 1: there's people like us who have platforms that we invest in or build or run and Audiences and all these things.

195
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:39,100
Speaker 1: so like I have a lot of ways to take things I want to say and put them on the internet and I don't think about it.

196
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,319
Speaker 1: There's no friction in that process.

197
00:11:40,821 --> 00:11:46,960
Speaker 1: But most people don't use really any services at all and create very little content.

198
00:11:47,382 --> 00:11:52,400
Speaker 1: So when they want to create some content, they don't have any like pipeline or process to distribute that.

199
00:11:52,701 --> 00:11:59,050
Speaker 1: so the only avenue they have is the like Facebook and Twitter updates that they can post.

200
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:09,636
Speaker 0: there is so much content on the internet that is in a place it does not belong because The person who was posting that content is such a limited, you know view of the internet.

201
00:12:09,876 --> 00:12:11,140
Speaker 0: their scope is so small.

202
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:23,699
Speaker 0: I saw a post on the board game reddit the other day that was like there is this Skeezy dude in our board game group who's like, you know It's actually harassing me and grabbing me and the other people won't kick him out, right and it's like yes

203
00:12:23,859 --> 00:12:26,014
Speaker 1: one Everyone in that group is bad except you.

204
00:12:26,215 --> 00:12:26,779
Speaker 0: that's true.

205
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,907
Speaker 0: We already.

206
00:12:29,107 --> 00:12:32,780
Speaker 0: everything that to say about that issue has already been says a panel that we did at packs.

207
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,912
Speaker 0: Yes, the point is is board game reddit the right place for that.

208
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:39,740
Speaker 1: No, no, it's not not at all.

209
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,748
Speaker 1: Well for that the right place for it is a police report.

210
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:49,388
Speaker 0: That's exactly right, but I see me will write like essays as like a Reddit post in a subreddit.

211
00:12:49,428 --> 00:12:49,670
Speaker 0: It's like.

212
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,720
Speaker 0: don't you have a blog for that?

213
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,224
Speaker 0: You know, it's like.

214
00:12:52,265 --> 00:12:56,920
Speaker 0: no one has a. you know It's the only place that person could think of to know that content one hand.

215
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:02,951
Speaker 1: There was a time when I would do that kind of thing, too But that time was the 90s and the reason was back then.

216
00:13:03,011 --> 00:13:11,319
Speaker 1: I was young and the internet was a very different place and I Carefully cultivated different personas and different parts of the internet and did not link them.

217
00:13:11,661 --> 00:13:17,000
Speaker 0: How many people like make a video and put it as a tweet when they should be making a YouTube video and then linking to?

218
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,743
Speaker 0: It with a tweet.

219
00:13:17,924 --> 00:13:21,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you gotta post your content in the right place.

220
00:13:21,621 --> 00:13:24,999
Speaker 1: All I'm gonna say is the way my hand is is one on my phone.

221
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:28,439
Speaker 1: now I'm using a Twitter client that just doesn't show me the other people's likes.

222
00:13:28,784 --> 00:13:30,422
Speaker 0: yeah, I ever see.

223
00:13:30,502 --> 00:13:38,760
Speaker 0: I never understood why people complain about this so much because you should not be using the default Twitter client ever not on The web not on your phone on in your tablet not on your nothing.

224
00:13:38,921 --> 00:13:40,756
Speaker 1: I like going to come because it's the easiest.

225
00:13:40,776 --> 00:13:42,023
Speaker 1: just here we go Please.

226
00:13:42,044 --> 00:13:43,480
Speaker 0: there is tweet deck is free.

227
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:48,119
Speaker 0: It has no ads and also has no bullshit and is also officially made by Twitter because they bought it.

228
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,644
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's been around for years.

229
00:13:49,685 --> 00:13:53,800
Speaker 0: I've never used the official Twitter website ever except to like change my Twitter password or something.

230
00:13:54,661 --> 00:13:57,760
Speaker 0: There's no reason to ever use official Twitter app or official Twitter website.

231
00:13:57,981 --> 00:14:02,547
Speaker 0: they have ads and they're way worse than everything else and The other things are free.

232
00:14:02,829 --> 00:14:06,525
Speaker 0: And in fact, if you pay for some of the ones that aren't free It's like you're using Twitter.

233
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:10,680
Speaker 0: First of all, it's like I think tweet bot is what like 10 bucks or something an iPhone?

234
00:14:11,121 --> 00:14:12,064
Speaker 1: Well, hey the 10 bucks.

235
00:14:12,124 --> 00:14:12,887
Speaker 1: I'm gonna often.

236
00:14:12,927 --> 00:14:17,060
Speaker 0: you're using Twitter constantly all day and that's like three bagels.

237
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:24,251
Speaker 0: But I mean, come on you're doing this way more than three breakfast sandwiches To get rid of all ads and have no complaints.

238
00:14:24,592 --> 00:14:26,760
Speaker 1: Well, though so here's an interesting problem that occurs.

239
00:14:26,841 --> 00:14:27,950
Speaker 1: It's the same thing with ads in the 90s.

240
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:34,791
Speaker 1: in the 90s I would say the same thing and whenever anyone saw an ad I'd be like how Why would you ever see an ad on the internet?

241
00:14:35,093 --> 00:14:36,460
Speaker 1: Do you want my hosts file?

242
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:44,900
Speaker 1: But as a result people who were smart enough to recognize that ads were toxic just blocked them.

243
00:14:45,421 --> 00:14:54,979
Speaker 1: So there was very little UX pressure to deal with ads getting more and more toxic Because the people who saw them were the kinds of people who wouldn't complain or would just suck it up.

244
00:14:55,581 --> 00:15:14,400
Speaker 1: And I feel like Twitter is in a similar boat where all the people who know better have ways to avoid the worst UX decisions that Twitter's making and Regular people get fucked by them and at the same time don't have enough under like they'll get mad at Twitter But they don't understand what changed that made them matter at Twitter.

245
00:15:14,862 --> 00:15:24,767
Speaker 1: So they can't effectively complain about it and Twitter seems to do literally the worst job on earth and actually finding out what people want to use their platform for or They do know.

246
00:15:24,787 --> 00:15:26,156
Speaker 1: this is what I actually suspect.

247
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:32,380
Speaker 1: Twitter knows exactly What people want to use their platform for and they don't want you to use it that way because they can't make as much money.

248
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:34,066
Speaker 1: They want it to be a platform.

249
00:15:34,086 --> 00:15:35,772
Speaker 0: How do you make it money to begin with?

250
00:15:35,912 --> 00:15:36,454
Speaker 0: They're not?

251
00:15:36,776 --> 00:15:37,839
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's understand.

252
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,205
Speaker 1: now I'm confident I could make.

253
00:15:39,225 --> 00:15:46,070
Speaker 1: I could personally make Twitter like just this service Something that made more money than it costs without ruining it.

254
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:50,893
Speaker 0: However, I think that Twitter you might think Twitter's so big It can't be replaced or whatever.

255
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:56,460
Speaker 0: But look My space got killed by Facebook and Facebook also will die at some point.

256
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:03,475
Speaker 1: So there is stuff's all really different though nowadays Like that was still kind of an early pioneering error of the Internet.

257
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:12,328
Speaker 0: things will die It can't last forever and also nothing even close to credible has appeared for Twitter, though You just need to get some people on there.

258
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:13,212
Speaker 1: Yeah, who remember?

259
00:16:13,232 --> 00:16:14,618
Speaker 1: Hello that lasted a minute.

260
00:16:15,864 --> 00:16:16,265
Speaker 0: It can happen.

261
00:16:16,506 --> 00:16:18,535
Speaker 1: It's I'm pretty dubious of that.

262
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:19,579
Speaker 0: I'll make one then.

263
00:16:20,422 --> 00:16:26,000
Speaker 1: The only way it would happen is if someone set it up to basically ride on Twitter's coattails.

264
00:16:26,221 --> 00:16:27,385
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think you can do it.

265
00:16:27,546 --> 00:16:27,927
Speaker 1: I don't know.

266
00:16:27,948 --> 00:16:29,474
Speaker 0: I don't think so and it could be done.

267
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,980
Speaker 1: people settle and then they're done.

268
00:16:31,746 --> 00:16:32,076
Speaker 1: We'll see.

269
00:16:32,802 --> 00:16:46,138
Speaker 1: But I feel like the real problem here is that Twitter as a company or at least the people who want to make money off of Twitter what they actually want is a platform where People are creating Content just to get other people to read it.

270
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:52,199
Speaker 1: But the real product is that most people are only following celebrities who tweet sponsored things at them.

271
00:16:53,042 --> 00:16:57,880
Speaker 1: They don't actually want like you and me just to add each other because they don't make money off of that.

272
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:05,954
Speaker 1: Well anyway in some other news Another one of those somebody gets dragged off of a flight.

273
00:17:06,195 --> 00:17:16,060
Speaker 0: situations happen Which happens often a lot of how those happening lately or maybe they were always happening But people didn't record the video of them with their phones and then put it on Twitter.

274
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,086
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is now what's happening.

275
00:17:18,126 --> 00:17:27,560
Speaker 1: So now we're learning about them more often, but this one's a little bit interesting because I'm pretty much a hundred percent on the side of the airline in this case.

276
00:17:28,143 --> 00:17:30,776
Speaker 1: Yeah, um in terms of dragging this woman off the plane.

277
00:17:30,836 --> 00:17:36,839
Speaker 1: So the deal is you know, you fly on an airline and they give you peanuts sometimes and sometimes they don't give you peanuts.

278
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:48,320
Speaker 1: and usually when they don't give you peanuts either they're one of those weird no peanut airlines or Somebody who's gonna be on the flight registered in advance and said I got a dangerous peanut allergy.

279
00:17:48,883 --> 00:17:51,719
Speaker 1: Don't let any peanuts be on my flight and they'll take care of that for you.

280
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:57,337
Speaker 1: Now there's the whole aside about how a good percentage of the people who claim to have peanut allergies probably don't.

281
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:58,582
Speaker 1: but that's a whole separate Discussion.

282
00:17:58,862 --> 00:18:00,227
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's fine.

283
00:18:00,267 --> 00:18:01,009
Speaker 1: That's that's the thing.

284
00:18:01,672 --> 00:18:04,280
Speaker 0: This woman got our people who do have deadly peanut allergies.

285
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,004
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not like.

286
00:18:05,044 --> 00:18:08,300
Speaker 1: that is the thing that does not exist, but it is a thing that is over reported.

287
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,229
Speaker 0: Obviously many things are over reported.

288
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:18,514
Speaker 1: So this person got on a plane and There was someone else had a dog with them on the flight which happens.

289
00:18:18,595 --> 00:18:19,357
Speaker 1: That's totally fine.

290
00:18:19,377 --> 00:18:20,520
Speaker 0: There were dogs on my last flight.

291
00:18:20,661 --> 00:18:22,468
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I love it when there's a dog in my flight.

292
00:18:22,488 --> 00:18:25,560
Speaker 0: Everyone's petting them in the in the gate while waiting to get on board.

293
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,664
Speaker 1: It's good stuff little dog.

294
00:18:26,684 --> 00:18:31,660
Speaker 1: I know I believe this dog was actually a service dog too, which made it even more interesting.

295
00:18:31,881 --> 00:18:47,880
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm because this person Claimed once the once they saw they already got on the plane and they were settled and once they saw that there was a dog On the plane they flipped out and demanded that the dog be removed the plane because they claim to have a deadly dog allergy.

296
00:18:48,202 --> 00:18:49,126
Speaker 0: Okay, so why didn't?

297
00:18:49,246 --> 00:18:50,211
Speaker 0: how come you're not already dead?

298
00:18:50,231 --> 00:18:56,148
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd I literally Believe that that is a lie.

299
00:18:56,168 --> 00:19:02,869
Speaker 0: I don't think that deadly dog allergy is Thing but I've never heard of deadly dog allergy.

300
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:03,531
Speaker 0: it could exist.

301
00:19:03,872 --> 00:19:04,093
Speaker 0: Yep.

302
00:19:04,253 --> 00:19:08,505
Speaker 0: I could be wrong but even so How come you're not dead?

303
00:19:08,545 --> 00:19:10,252
Speaker 0: didn't you see the dog in the gate area?

304
00:19:10,292 --> 00:19:10,453
Speaker 0: like?

305
00:19:10,493 --> 00:19:14,413
Speaker 1: the whole thing doesn't make a lot of sense Ah, but even more important the person who's on the plane.

306
00:19:14,574 --> 00:19:15,620
Speaker 1: The dog is also on the plane.

307
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,643
Speaker 1: The person is not dead.

308
00:19:16,984 --> 00:19:20,133
Speaker 1: the person demands that the dog be removed in the air.

309
00:19:20,213 --> 00:19:22,440
Speaker 0: on the plane is very not circulated.

310
00:19:22,641 --> 00:19:24,588
Speaker 0: Well, you'd be already in bad shape.

311
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:27,960
Speaker 1: The airline is like do you have a doctor's note or anything?

312
00:19:28,761 --> 00:19:38,813
Speaker 1: and of course this person does not because they're clearly making it out and The airlines like well in the interest of your safety Will remove you from the plane and put you on another flight that doesn't have dogs on it.

313
00:19:39,516 --> 00:19:45,866
Speaker 1: and that's when this person Super freaks out and ends up getting arrested Because they wouldn't get off the plane.

314
00:19:46,628 --> 00:19:47,792
Speaker 1: and that's the funny part.

315
00:19:47,832 --> 00:19:55,079
Speaker 1: This person refused to get off the plane That had a dog on it that if they weren't lying would kill them.

316
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:02,800
Speaker 1: They refused to get off when given the chance to remove themselves from the deadly thing that will kill them.

317
00:20:03,261 --> 00:20:08,257
Speaker 0: Someone has a legit peanut allergy and I pull out a pea jar of skippy and start unscrewing it.

318
00:20:08,638 --> 00:20:09,040
Speaker 0: they run.

319
00:20:09,522 --> 00:20:10,225
Speaker 0: That's how it works.

320
00:20:10,245 --> 00:20:15,087
Speaker 0: Yeah, if they weren't running they must be lying Or they cray.

321
00:20:15,107 --> 00:20:16,937
Speaker 0: Yeah, they got a death wish.

322
00:20:16,997 --> 00:20:24,798
Speaker 0: I don't know But if I'm allergic to if you break if you come up with some poison ivy and you're like, hey Scott, okay I'm gonna run the fuck away.

323
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:29,793
Speaker 0: Right, I mean I might go to the airline gate and be like yo.

324
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,380
Speaker 0: someone on the complaint got poison ivy.

325
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,775
Speaker 0: Try to rub it on everyone and then they'll arrest you though an ivy man, sir.

326
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:36,926
Speaker 0: But do you have?

327
00:20:37,087 --> 00:20:38,876
Speaker 0: I'm not hanging around your wrist.

328
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:42,419
Speaker 1: you rub it, sir Do you have a doctor's note saying that poison ivy is dangerous to you?

329
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,786
Speaker 0: Yes, yes, I do.

330
00:20:44,806 --> 00:20:47,520
Speaker 0: Let me show you my leg where the rash is currently growing.

331
00:20:47,603 --> 00:20:48,038
Speaker 0: I'm again

332
00:20:48,421 --> 00:21:10,300
Speaker 1: But I will say that I have encountered a very similar situation at multiple points in my life and it always boils down the same way and that's kind of why I was interested in this story is Because and I've seen this happen a lot at restaurants especially in states that allow animals and restaurants like not this not this there's no states that say oh you have to let animals that Are not service animals in your restaurant.

333
00:21:10,441 --> 00:21:15,079
Speaker 0: There's a lot of rules saying use even if you want to let animals in your restaurant You can't because hair gets in the food.

334
00:21:15,261 --> 00:21:15,745
Speaker 0: That's not.

335
00:21:15,906 --> 00:21:21,117
Speaker 1: and that was actually even though Arguably the restaurant owner should be as long as they make it clear should be able to make that choice.

336
00:21:21,298 --> 00:21:31,072
Speaker 1: New York I think recently passed a law saying that I might get a B instead of a outdoor Restaurants can if they wish to allow patients to have dogs with them.

337
00:21:31,273 --> 00:21:31,493
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

338
00:21:31,553 --> 00:21:33,298
Speaker 1: No, I don't have to really.

339
00:21:33,338 --> 00:21:35,840
Speaker 0: I thought Outdoor was totally okay.

340
00:21:36,765 --> 00:21:37,469
Speaker 0: Was the problem?

341
00:21:37,489 --> 00:21:39,038
Speaker 0: because that's where the foods being prepared.

342
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:43,296
Speaker 1: Nope So no because the food preparation area is separated from the dining area.

343
00:21:43,376 --> 00:21:46,730
Speaker 0: You're eating outside Right, it's like dog in New York.

344
00:21:46,992 --> 00:21:51,776
Speaker 0: the amount of fecal coliform Is the least of your worries getting on the food.

345
00:21:51,796 --> 00:21:55,793
Speaker 0: if you're eating outside They're just cars blasting exhaust particles onto your food.

346
00:21:55,813 --> 00:22:07,959
Speaker 0: if you're eating inside outside About some dog hair ever been outside and smell some poop in the distance homeless man walks past your you know Restaurant while you're eating there and gets you know, who knows what particles right?

347
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,628
Speaker 1: Particles it's always food particles.

348
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:14,380
Speaker 0: I agree an inside then your food could be relatively safe from you know.

349
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:25,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the law that changed was that if a restaurant wants to allow it They are allowed to allow it and if you don't like it somewhere else, that's there and it's still dog and cat cafes and stuff.

350
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,610
Speaker 0: They just have to keep the animal area separate from the eating area.

351
00:22:28,631 --> 00:22:34,133
Speaker 1: Yeah, I really really occasionally I've worked at places where people just brought their dogs to work every day and I miss that.

352
00:22:34,414 --> 00:22:35,860
Speaker 0: that's totally cool in an office.

353
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:40,558
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not a food preparation office or a kitchen but I've grown into a slab.

354
00:22:41,222 --> 00:22:42,954
Speaker 0: It's just the office of desks and chairs.

355
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:43,840
Speaker 0: You can totally bring a dog.

356
00:22:43,921 --> 00:22:51,984
Speaker 1: I've run into many situations in my life Most of when I was younger and living with my family and having dogs where there are places where it is Okay for pets to be.

357
00:22:52,585 --> 00:23:04,000
Speaker 1: but there are people who just don't like animals and try to complain to get said Animals removed from the area not because they're causing a problem because they don't like pets and they don't like people who have pets.

358
00:23:04,402 --> 00:23:06,620
Speaker 0: There's people who you know, there's a nimby attitude.

359
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:15,898
Speaker 0: I don't like that thing that someone else is doing so I want to impose my will on them with my HOA or my whatever And that's basically just the worst person there is.

360
00:23:17,002 --> 00:23:17,892
Speaker 0: Someone's a bad person.

361
00:23:18,134 --> 00:23:22,980
Speaker 1: I am like 99% confident that that is the situation here that this person just doesn't like dogs.

362
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:29,772
Speaker 0: Whenever I see anyone trying to impose their will on someone else just because that person's doing something They don't like you know, turn off that loud music.

363
00:23:29,853 --> 00:23:32,427
Speaker 0: That's not actually keeping you awake You just don't like my music.

364
00:23:32,447 --> 00:23:34,319
Speaker 1: stop killing all those people Scott.

365
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,510
Speaker 0: Okay, but I mean that's actually hurting other people.

366
00:23:37,651 --> 00:23:38,515
Speaker 1: It's not hurting you though.

367
00:23:38,535 --> 00:23:39,640
Speaker 1: So what do you have to complain?

368
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,809
Speaker 0: Loud music, you know, my party music isn't hurting anybody.

369
00:23:43,829 --> 00:23:45,375
Speaker 0: My dog isn't hurting anyone yet.

370
00:23:45,696 --> 00:23:48,007
Speaker 0: It might hurt you though There's a by rim dog.

371
00:23:48,047 --> 00:23:58,699
Speaker 0: There is a threshold above which party music can hurt you Sure, but if I'm under the threshold and you just you know, you didn't care when that neighbor was having the disco party But suddenly I'm having a hip-hop party and you mad.

372
00:24:00,262 --> 00:24:02,230
Speaker 1: What I do think though he's oh here's a side.

373
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:04,860
Speaker 1: one thing we definitely need to ban is loud vehicles.

374
00:24:05,525 --> 00:24:08,102
Speaker 1: There is no place for that in the mind They are.

375
00:24:08,123 --> 00:24:12,900
Speaker 0: there's ordinances pretty much everywhere about how loud your vehicle can be just they don't enforce it too much.

376
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:18,878
Speaker 1: Yep, cuz the other day we were down in Brooklyn and there was a lot of motorcycles farting around.

377
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:24,458
Speaker 1: super loud Yep, and then I finally figured out cuz I biked home most a lot of motorcycles just illegal in New York Perry.

378
00:24:24,498 --> 00:24:26,244
Speaker 0: in New York City There bikes at least.

379
00:24:26,906 --> 00:24:30,860
Speaker 1: oh my god the dirt bike thing that's like that's like such a New York specific problem.

380
00:24:31,222 --> 00:24:33,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean cuz dirt bikes are legal in most places.

381
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,900
Speaker 0: It's just not New York City and the cops love to basically confiscate dirt bikes.

382
00:24:37,141 --> 00:24:39,833
Speaker 0: Ah, but there's part and then make videos demolishing them all.

383
00:24:40,075 --> 00:24:42,767
Speaker 1: but part of the reason for that Cuz I just a waste of resources.

384
00:24:42,787 --> 00:24:43,008
Speaker 0: really.

385
00:24:43,028 --> 00:24:44,515
Speaker 0: they should auction those off upstate.

386
00:24:44,675 --> 00:24:48,171
Speaker 1: So I've encountered The dirt bike menace before.

387
00:24:48,493 --> 00:25:10,200
Speaker 1: basically what happens in New York Like kinda regularly is a whole bunch of teenagers and young adults who have these illegal dirt bikes Will sort of have a flash mob somewhere and then there'll be hundreds of them just without license plates Screaming around on streets going the wrong way on roads and on sidewalks and blocking traffic and hurting people and causing trouble.

388
00:25:10,421 --> 00:25:13,793
Speaker 1: Yep, that happens like that flash mob of dirt bikes.

389
00:25:13,913 --> 00:25:15,158
Speaker 1: I've seen it twice.

390
00:25:15,318 --> 00:25:17,184
Speaker 0: I've seen it Way more than twice.

391
00:25:17,485 --> 00:25:22,299
Speaker 1: I've seen it twice in like giant mob that I called 9-1-1 about and I've never called 9-1-1 on them.

392
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,664
Speaker 0: But I go.

393
00:25:23,745 --> 00:25:25,051
Speaker 1: hey, no, they're they were they.

394
00:25:25,071 --> 00:25:26,358
Speaker 1: so they were going in.

395
00:25:27,302 --> 00:25:31,440
Speaker 1: You know how the Pulaski has the one way and then the other way and then the bikeway.

396
00:25:32,103 --> 00:25:34,559
Speaker 1: They were riding in one direction on all three of those.

397
00:25:35,221 --> 00:25:40,940
Speaker 1: They're going against traffic on the Pulaski and with traffic and screaming through the bike lane.

398
00:25:41,587 --> 00:25:42,579
Speaker 1: And it wasn't just dirt bikes.

399
00:25:42,901 --> 00:25:48,620
Speaker 1: There were some three-wheelers in there like the off-road three-wheelers as in literally never ride one of those.

400
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,191
Speaker 0: They're one of those dangerous illegal to ride in New York City.

401
00:25:51,312 --> 00:25:53,020
Speaker 0: Also dangerous to ride anywhere ever.

402
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:56,050
Speaker 1: Yeah for ATV four-wheel fine like that.

403
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:58,760
Speaker 0: Those are safe to ride them in appropriate, you know.

404
00:25:59,061 --> 00:26:01,953
Speaker 1: Yeah, there is no safe place to ride a three-wheel ATV.

405
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:12,514
Speaker 1: Those things are just pure death but anyway things Of the day.

406
00:26:12,554 --> 00:26:13,739
Speaker 1: What do you got?

407
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:19,810
Speaker 0: So geek nights has a long tradition of using a Soviet and Eastern European awesome artworks as things.

408
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:23,805
Speaker 1: Oh, I think there's a theme because my thing of the day is also Soviet related.

409
00:26:23,825 --> 00:26:31,125
Speaker 0: That's how we do here And we haven't done any of those in quite a while Right, not since like I guess one of those Tetris thing or something.

410
00:26:31,145 --> 00:26:32,130
Speaker 0: Who knows anyway.

411
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:41,374
Speaker 0: So this is something that's really interesting because back in the day when people Poisoned themselves more than they do now when it was socially acceptable Right now it's really not.

412
00:26:41,555 --> 00:26:47,476
Speaker 0: when people when lighters were not as common people used matches to light their you know Deadly tobacco poison.

413
00:26:47,777 --> 00:26:50,770
Speaker 1: Maybe they use that oil lighter like the guy who burned his house down on the live stream

414
00:26:50,810 --> 00:27:05,538
Speaker 0: and people had you know match books and match boxes and match books and match boxes were for all their negatives were very useful and that they provide a venue for the displaying of Advertisements and also artwork.

415
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:14,145
Speaker 0: So here is a collection of match box Advertisements and artworks from Eastern Europe and Soviet Russia and these are so great.

416
00:27:14,185 --> 00:27:15,208
Speaker 1: I want a table top.

417
00:27:15,248 --> 00:27:17,419
Speaker 1: board games Uses this aesthetic.

418
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:21,096
Speaker 0: right and the aesthetic is awesome especially the outer space related ones.

419
00:27:21,457 --> 00:27:26,133
Speaker 0: also the camera related ones and the family related ones and the Everything.

420
00:27:26,213 --> 00:27:30,248
Speaker 0: some of them look sort of like the glory to Rome black box artwork.

421
00:27:30,469 --> 00:27:30,870
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

422
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,915
Speaker 1: So look at these ski ones.

423
00:27:32,976 --> 00:27:33,256
Speaker 1: How about?

424
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:36,266
Speaker 0: there's an ice hockey, you know sports related.

425
00:27:36,386 --> 00:27:41,240
Speaker 0: It's pretty much all great and It's like I kind of wish there was.

426
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:50,904
Speaker 0: you know as we move to the digital realm Which is great, obviously and away from smoking which is even better perhaps We're not generating these physical artifacts anymore without fizz.

427
00:27:51,145 --> 00:27:59,090
Speaker 0: without physical artifacts There are less physical places for the displaying of art that you can encounter and collect in.

428
00:28:00,454 --> 00:28:11,019
Speaker 1: so the thing that used to be that no longer be is If you were reading a book in public anywhere people could see what book you were reading Which might start a conversation or something.

429
00:28:11,521 --> 00:28:14,633
Speaker 1: now that just a back of a black Kindle You could.

430
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,822
Speaker 1: what if you put another screen on the Kindle?

431
00:28:16,902 --> 00:28:17,625
Speaker 0: I think there was.

432
00:28:17,685 --> 00:28:18,810
Speaker 0: there was something like that.

433
00:28:19,171 --> 00:28:20,034
Speaker 1: I feel like there was.

434
00:28:20,355 --> 00:28:21,719
Speaker 0: yeah, but that kind of thing.

435
00:28:21,739 --> 00:28:22,863
Speaker 1: We got to make did?

436
00:28:22,903 --> 00:28:24,247
Speaker 0: they're actually on Kickstarter.

437
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:25,130
Speaker 0: It's way too much money.

438
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:31,370
Speaker 0: They're selling an e-book that contains the entire fist of the North Star manga and you can read it in Japanese or English.

439
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,859
Speaker 0: We've never been in English.

440
00:28:32,899 --> 00:28:39,290
Speaker 0: It's very very expensive But it's one e-book and you can't like put other books on it.

441
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,779
Speaker 0: It literally only reads fist of the North Star.

442
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:48,597
Speaker 0: you open it up and there it is two screens one left one on the right Just like a real manga But it's only fist of the North Star.

443
00:28:48,818 --> 00:28:50,404
Speaker 0: You can't load a different e-book on it.

444
00:28:50,424 --> 00:28:52,914
Speaker 0: You can't unload fist of the North Star Nothing.

445
00:28:53,216 --> 00:28:55,210
Speaker 0: It's just that one book forever and in the bat.

446
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:59,850
Speaker 0: And it looks like a book because the back of it is a cover because it you open it up and there's two screens.

447
00:29:00,276 --> 00:29:01,209
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

448
00:29:02,331 --> 00:29:03,856
Speaker 1: So I don't want it.

449
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:08,250
Speaker 1: you buy it and I'll read it, you know, we should do we should do up we should kick-start.

450
00:29:08,551 --> 00:29:10,038
Speaker 0: We'll buy very expensive.

451
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,284
Speaker 0: It's like hundreds of dollars.

452
00:29:11,304 --> 00:29:17,349
Speaker 1: We kick-start it and Everyone who buys in we just make a list and we pass it around like Radioactive Man number one.

453
00:29:18,111 --> 00:29:20,210
Speaker 1: Sure, everybody reads it and passes it to the next person.

454
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:23,907
Speaker 1: You got ten bucks for me this and the more money you give the higher up in the list you go.

455
00:29:23,987 --> 00:29:27,300
Speaker 1: who gets it first I'll give you maybe 20 and if you break it I kill you.

456
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,929
Speaker 0: because what are you gonna do with the batteries run out on it?

457
00:29:30,512 --> 00:29:33,286
Speaker 0: Okay, if you charge, I don't know how it fucking works gotta be ice.

458
00:29:33,346 --> 00:29:34,010
Speaker 1: What if it breaks?

459
00:29:35,175 --> 00:29:37,741
Speaker 1: No, if it broke that Radioactive man number one.

460
00:29:37,963 --> 00:29:45,830
Speaker 1: I'm just saying so in my Soviet thing of the day, I don't think any of none of us have flown on a Concorde.

461
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:46,534
Speaker 1: That was kind of before.

462
00:29:46,735 --> 00:29:52,047
Speaker 0: I have never been on a Concorde though I have seen one in person because it's on the intrepid.

463
00:29:52,812 --> 00:29:54,081
Speaker 0: Yes, that one go look at that.

464
00:29:54,142 --> 00:29:55,813
Speaker 1: one used to go inside it But now you can't.

465
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:56,616
Speaker 0: but I've see.

466
00:29:56,657 --> 00:29:59,370
Speaker 0: I've also seen what another one like at an airport just sitting there.

467
00:29:59,791 --> 00:30:01,237
Speaker 1: But the Concorde is pretty cool.

468
00:30:01,277 --> 00:30:02,843
Speaker 1: And I don't want to get too deep.

469
00:30:02,883 --> 00:30:04,750
Speaker 0: It's also way smaller than it looks in photos.

470
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:09,565
Speaker 1: Well, most things are like fighter jets, you know, you look at a real fighter jet and it's so tiny.

471
00:30:09,946 --> 00:30:10,930
Speaker 1: It's almost shocking.

472
00:30:11,792 --> 00:30:13,308
Speaker 0: Well, it only needs to hold one or two people.

473
00:30:13,852 --> 00:30:16,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the Concorde held a reasonable number of people.

474
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:29,470
Speaker 1: But if you're too young to even know what the hell the Concorde was it was a super jet developed by Europeans that Could fly between New York and London in a shockingly short amount of time.

475
00:30:29,511 --> 00:30:33,590
Speaker 0: So yeah There are only a few routes you could take on it and there are mostly transatlantic flights.

476
00:30:33,952 --> 00:30:43,064
Speaker 1: The reason is a lot of money had nothing to do with technology was mostly protectionism NIMBYism and fear of a sound problem due to the sonic booms.

477
00:30:43,084 --> 00:30:45,210
Speaker 1: that may or may not have been as bad as people implied.

478
00:30:45,473 --> 00:30:47,210
Speaker 0: Right, but I've never heard the sonic boom from it.

479
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:47,732
Speaker 0: So I don't know.

480
00:30:47,933 --> 00:30:51,870
Speaker 0: so I but I have heard fighter jets fly over and that sonic boom is annoying.

481
00:30:52,151 --> 00:30:56,570
Speaker 1: I spent much of my life living next to Selfridge Air National Guard base.

482
00:30:56,891 --> 00:31:06,708
Speaker 1: F-16s in formation would fly over my house like multiple times a day And occasionally they drop the afterburners and sonic booms would happen and it was kind of amazing.

483
00:31:06,728 --> 00:31:10,030
Speaker 1: amazing But also really really really annoying.

484
00:31:10,792 --> 00:31:13,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, but also planes used to just be louder like.

485
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,203
Speaker 1: don't get into that.

486
00:31:14,223 --> 00:31:15,748
Speaker 0: But anyway cars used to be louder too.

487
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:26,380
Speaker 1: So Europeans made the Concorde and Soviets and the Americans got Jealous and were pulled a me too as in.

488
00:31:26,641 --> 00:31:29,610
Speaker 1: they wanted to prove that they have the ability to also develop something like that.

489
00:31:30,152 --> 00:31:33,504
Speaker 1: The American Concorde was garbage, but I'm not talking about that.

490
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:39,910
Speaker 1: I think of the day is a video Titled why you wouldn't want to fly on the Soviet Concorde.

491
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,816
Speaker 0: I wouldn't want to fly in the Soviet anything.

492
00:31:41,857 --> 00:31:43,382
Speaker 1: Tupolev tu-144 story.

493
00:31:43,743 --> 00:31:45,690
Speaker 0: I learned everything I need to know about Soviet.

494
00:31:46,095 --> 00:31:54,625
Speaker 0: You know aerospace Not the space part but the arrow from aerobids cheapest and the crappiest place in aerobids.

495
00:31:55,067 --> 00:32:03,669
Speaker 1: if you Started in the Soviet Union you could you could buy Soviet planes But you didn't start in the Soviet Union because shit sucked over there.

496
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:12,975
Speaker 1: And if you started anywhere else in the game, except like Iraq you uh, you could buy any planes from like Airbus or Boeing But you couldn't fly.

497
00:32:12,995 --> 00:32:13,336
Speaker 1: so via

498
00:32:13,356 --> 00:32:14,099
Speaker 0: body

499
00:32:14,581 --> 00:32:33,382
Speaker 1: if you went and you have McDonald Douglas the MD 80 I played a lot of that game, but if you tried to buy the Soviet planes, they'd be like, sorry you can't buy from Eastern Bloc countries, but if you played in the right era eventually perestroika would happen and Eastern markets would open up and you could go buy those planes.

500
00:32:33,724 --> 00:32:37,150
Speaker 1: and then suddenly you could go talk to the representatives from Ilyushin and Tupolev.

501
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:46,270
Speaker 1: And the first thing you realize is that those planes Were pieces of shit and you literally never ever wanted to buy them under any circumstances.

502
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:47,713
Speaker 0: No, you could.

503
00:32:47,853 --> 00:32:53,590
Speaker 0: you could profit by putting them on some shitty route except they use so much gas and were so unreliable.

504
00:32:53,832 --> 00:32:55,100
Speaker 1: They ended up costing too much.

505
00:32:55,121 --> 00:32:56,450
Speaker 0: They're so cheap to buy.

506
00:32:56,691 --> 00:32:57,976
Speaker 1: They weren't actually that cheap.

507
00:32:58,016 --> 00:33:02,644
Speaker 0: and as long as you only need them for a short amount of time just to get a little bit Of profit so you can buy a better plane.

508
00:33:04,572 --> 00:33:07,270
Speaker 0: Or so we're Soviet Russia and you can't buy another plane.

509
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:07,892
Speaker 0: Yeah Pretty much.

510
00:33:07,912 --> 00:33:12,330
Speaker 1: the only reason you use those as you started in Russia because you hate yourself and you wanted the game to be impossible.

511
00:33:14,511 --> 00:33:21,108
Speaker 1: The only other crazy place to start was Iraq because you could start in Iraq and then the Iraq war would break out like two Years into the game and just ruin you.

512
00:33:22,933 --> 00:33:25,385
Speaker 1: So, yeah Don't think you wanted to fly on the tu-144.

513
00:33:26,991 --> 00:33:34,418
Speaker 1: And then at a moment the booklet book is not the first or the fourth or the third or the sixth But the fifth season one two or five.

514
00:33:34,698 --> 00:33:42,210
Speaker 0: Yes five seasons is the first book of the Broken Earth trilogy By NK Jemisin and I finished reading it in its entirety.

515
00:33:42,291 --> 00:33:51,643
Speaker 0: I started reading the second one a little bit But actually I stopped because a I'm playing Metroid on my DS and now I don't want to mess up my thinking of the first Book too much because the blinds will get blurred.

516
00:33:51,724 --> 00:33:51,885
Speaker 1: Yep.

517
00:33:52,005 --> 00:33:52,610
Speaker 1: I'm gonna read it.

518
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:56,970
Speaker 0: I'm gonna read through it pretty quick because book two starts pretty much immediately at the end of book one.

519
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:07,250
Speaker 0: I almost feel like the first book was actually shorter cuz I didn't couldn't tell how long it was with Ebookness and the fact that the end of the book doesn't end when the Kindle says a hundred percent it ends before then.

520
00:34:07,731 --> 00:34:09,217
Speaker 0: So I did, you know sort of cut out to me.

521
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:23,489
Speaker 0: It really feels I don't know how long book two and three are But just from book one It feels like really all these three books are one book that happened to be chopped into three Yeah, even pieces because it just picks up right where the first one left off like immediately.

522
00:34:24,491 --> 00:34:30,349
Speaker 1: But yeah, if I don't finish it by the next Thursday show I'll definitely have it done a month from now because I'm just gonna read it real soon.

523
00:34:30,731 --> 00:34:31,976
Speaker 1: Problems my commute so short.

524
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,610
Speaker 1: I literally can't read fiction on my commute.

525
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:43,389
Speaker 0: There are other times of the day where reading is fine Ah, but the weather's been nice and I've been creating content like before you go to bed and immediately when you wake up.

526
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:44,331
Speaker 1: Yeah before I go to bed.

527
00:34:44,351 --> 00:34:45,275
Speaker 1: I'm playing overwatch.

528
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,038
Speaker 0: Well, don't do that.

529
00:34:46,158 --> 00:34:47,302
Speaker 0: No, I don't do that.

530
00:34:47,583 --> 00:34:49,690
Speaker 1: Did you should I read overwatch?

531
00:34:50,371 --> 00:34:50,891
Speaker 1: It's still.

532
00:34:51,112 --> 00:34:52,918
Speaker 1: overwatch is so up your alley.

533
00:34:52,938 --> 00:34:57,436
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's all those feels of those old quick mods I'm killing some metroids right now.

534
00:34:57,616 --> 00:35:00,350
Speaker 1: Well, we can play some PUBG together because we'll both be equally bad at it.

535
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:00,753
Speaker 1: I think.

536
00:35:01,076 --> 00:35:02,870
Speaker 0: maybe I don't think it matter.

537
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:07,310
Speaker 0: I don't think I care if I play PUBG if I don't think I'll care about winning or losing so much.

538
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:11,815
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I feel like and I feel like if I die, I'm not gonna wait for the next round to start I'm just gonna join a different server.

539
00:35:12,136 --> 00:35:15,309
Speaker 1: I'm gonna try to play it enough until I win once and then I'll just quit.

540
00:35:16,831 --> 00:35:18,136
Speaker 0: It's not it's too much money for that.

541
00:35:18,156 --> 00:35:21,086
Speaker 1: Yeah, I feel like I'll never win it.

542
00:35:21,247 --> 00:35:21,789
Speaker 1: So we'll see.

543
00:35:21,809 --> 00:35:26,082
Speaker 1: I Feel like it's easier to win a counter-strike gun game than it is to win a PUBG.

544
00:35:26,122 --> 00:35:27,468
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a lot less competition.

545
00:35:27,789 --> 00:35:28,010
Speaker 1: Yeah.

546
00:35:29,056 --> 00:35:40,010
Speaker 1: So, uh Otherwise, if you follow me on YouTube, you should also follow Scott and if you follow Scott on YouTube You should also follow me because we just put up two big pieces of content on both of those.

547
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:44,630
Speaker 1: So on my youtube channel, you can see our newest pecs panel about rage quitters and butthurt rage.

548
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:49,890
Speaker 1: If you go to Scott's YouTube channel You can see the first episode of our new series based on the anime Boston panel.

549
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:58,866
Speaker 1: We used to do judge anime by its cover where we review next the next season's anime Before it comes out because we're good at that and we're usually right.

550
00:35:58,886 --> 00:36:05,630
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm You should also go to all the other places on the internet that exist like Twitter Facebook.

551
00:36:06,552 --> 00:36:08,570
Speaker 1: It's everywhere, you know, we don't have a myspace.

552
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:14,730
Speaker 0: We set up geek nights everywhere that we could set up shop for geek nights even like Instagram account Google Plus.

553
00:36:15,314 --> 00:36:17,629
Speaker 1: There is a Google Plus for us.

554
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:17,910
Speaker 1: you know.

555
00:36:17,931 --> 00:36:27,016
Speaker 0: if there's a place that you want us to set up shop on the internet and we're not there tell us I Google+ still exists.

00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:30,609
Speaker 1: I guess we could.

558
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:36,244
Speaker 1: So, yeah desks, I can't believe whatever.

570
00:36:56,598 --> 00:36:59,367
Speaker 1: You're trying to eat at your desk without spilling food into your keyboard.

571
00:36:59,929 --> 00:37:00,290
Speaker 0: I fail.

572
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,458
Speaker 0: I just banged out my keyboard today.

573
00:37:02,538 --> 00:37:04,605
Speaker 0: So many seeds from everything bagels came out.

574
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:05,208
Speaker 1: Yeah.

575
00:37:05,388 --> 00:37:12,047
Speaker 1: Yeah I uh once a month I take my keyboard and I do the hold it sideways and do the tap tap shake.

576
00:37:12,228 --> 00:37:14,415
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm and Horrors emerge.

577
00:37:14,475 --> 00:37:18,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much but for me mostly everything bagel seeds, so desks.

578
00:37:18,792 --> 00:37:19,769
Speaker 1: It's a way way back.

579
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:28,230
Speaker 1: We did a show on chairs because Scott and I both spent a lot of money to each buy a really really nice office chair And it turned out to be a great great investment.

580
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:31,950
Speaker 1: I'm sitting in the same chair that I bought in that geek nights episode at my apartment.

581
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:39,538
Speaker 0: I have the same chair and even though the armrests on it got busted once I emailed the company and they sent me brand new Even better armrests to swap out for free.

582
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:45,520
Speaker 1: if I had continued to buy cheaper office chairs I probably would have had to buy like four of them.

583
00:37:45,741 --> 00:37:52,084
Speaker 0: and people buy those horrific gaming chairs Look like a race a chair from a race car that on wheels, which is.

584
00:37:52,706 --> 00:37:53,810
Speaker 0: I don't know what the hell people find.

585
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,236
Speaker 1: Yeah, they don't even look that comfortable.

586
00:37:55,336 --> 00:37:55,637
Speaker 1: Actually.

587
00:37:55,818 --> 00:37:56,641
Speaker 1: I know now.

588
00:37:56,701 --> 00:37:58,027
Speaker 0: No, I've sat in them at packs.

589
00:37:58,047 --> 00:37:58,850
Speaker 0: They're not comfortable.

590
00:37:58,991 --> 00:38:01,530
Speaker 1: They're about as comfortable as a cheap office chair.

591
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:07,657
Speaker 0: However, if I was still a kid in high school instead of buying the $50 chair at Staples I would have bought that chair instead.

592
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:10,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I I love the hell out of this chair.

593
00:38:10,653 --> 00:38:13,169
Speaker 0: I was born earlier, so I didn't have to have that chair.

594
00:38:13,695 --> 00:38:23,126
Speaker 1: But if I had to list the Things that I interact with that are furniture or the things that could affect my life the most in terms of number of hours I'm forced to interact with them.

595
00:38:24,152 --> 00:38:30,010
Speaker 1: desks are like Almost a hundred percent Venn diagram overlap with chair.

596
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:36,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, you mean you're sitting in that chair for X hours a day every day and you sit and you're sitting at that desk.

597
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:38,458
Speaker 0: So isn't the desk almost as important?

598
00:38:38,678 --> 00:38:43,279
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's almost like an extension of the chair because if I'm not at my desk I'm not sitting in my chair.

599
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:46,409
Speaker 1: I'm lounging on a couch Or I'm at a table.

600
00:38:46,972 --> 00:38:51,627
Speaker 0: So there's so many desks these days come at so many varieties since people added the standing option.

601
00:38:51,647 --> 00:39:06,159
Speaker 1: Yep So at my new office the most of the of the desks because there's a cool kind of a cool thing There is that everyone is the exact same desk layout no matter what like no matter what their job is 100% identical everywhere.

602
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:12,141
Speaker 0: There's no offices or anything really even even Even Bloomberg just standing there in a field of people.

603
00:39:12,362 --> 00:39:12,562
Speaker 1: Yeah.

604
00:39:12,623 --> 00:39:14,410
Speaker 1: Well you can you can have that desk.

605
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:17,725
Speaker 1: That's a little more isolated, but it's still that exact size and shape.

606
00:39:17,765 --> 00:39:18,890
Speaker 0: He doesn't have an office with a door.

607
00:39:19,091 --> 00:39:21,621
Speaker 0: No one seems to not even Bloomberg himself.

608
00:39:22,023 --> 00:39:22,846
Speaker 1: It doesn't seem to be.

609
00:39:22,866 --> 00:39:24,994
Speaker 1: I don't work in his office I don't 100% know.

610
00:39:25,416 --> 00:39:26,159
Speaker 1: I've gone over there.

611
00:39:26,379 --> 00:39:28,226
Speaker 1: I'm just like strolling but like hey, what's up?

612
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:38,069
Speaker 1: Oh but anyway Most of the desks now have the big two monitors on a thing that you basically Lift it and now it's a standing desk.

613
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:43,928
Speaker 1: But because I joined recently mine does not have that so I do not have a standing desk.

614
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:46,002
Speaker 1: in fact I've never had a standing desk.

615
00:39:46,344 --> 00:39:46,990
Speaker 0: kind of want one.

616
00:39:47,211 --> 00:39:55,050
Speaker 0: Oh at my work basically if you ask for a standing desk They get you this thing that's like basically a little elevator that they put on your regular desk.

617
00:39:55,673 --> 00:39:59,636
Speaker 0: Oh, and then you put your stuff on top of that and then you sort of have to like pick it up And then put it.

618
00:39:59,656 --> 00:40:06,310
Speaker 1: that has two positions You grab your monitor and you just go and it's up and it brings the keyboard up with it.

619
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:10,724
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have no interest in standing desk unless it's the kind where I push a button.

620
00:40:10,744 --> 00:40:10,944
Speaker 0: It goes.

621
00:40:11,185 --> 00:40:19,650
Speaker 1: see it goes some sort of motorized situation right You know, there's all those studies like if you sit too many hours a day your chance of death from all causes increases.

622
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:28,163
Speaker 0: You know, I've seen all these different studies and I don't know what to believe because I've seen some that have been that say that's bullshit But those are paid for by big chair and a big chair.

623
00:40:28,204 --> 00:40:34,175
Speaker 0: and I see ones that are say You should stand and those are paid for by big standing desk And so I don't know who to believe.

624
00:40:34,316 --> 00:40:36,944
Speaker 1: I found a meta study that actually might explain that.

625
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:38,268
Speaker 1: All right, this is recent.

626
00:40:38,288 --> 00:40:40,940
Speaker 1: like I I'm gonna talk about this in the forum.

627
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,530
Speaker 1: I want to link to it like make a thread about it.

628
00:40:42,912 --> 00:40:43,998
Speaker 1: I read this a couple days ago.

629
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:44,340
Speaker 1: Also.

630
00:40:44,381 --> 00:40:45,728
Speaker 0: I already invested in big chair.

631
00:40:45,769 --> 00:40:45,970
Speaker 0: I don't.

632
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:52,407
Speaker 1: So there are studies that show if you sit too much your chances of death just increase.

633
00:40:52,448 --> 00:40:53,130
Speaker 1: like that's just a thing.

634
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:54,155
Speaker 1: That's there's a correlation.

635
00:40:54,276 --> 00:40:56,770
Speaker 0: But is it actually the sitting or just the fact that you're not doing anything?

636
00:40:57,291 --> 00:41:02,647
Speaker 1: There is a almost identical correlation for people who stand all the time who stand equivalent amount.

637
00:41:02,667 --> 00:41:03,590
Speaker 1: people have standing job.

638
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:05,182
Speaker 0: It's just not moving is the problem.

639
00:41:05,202 --> 00:41:12,330
Speaker 1: Uh People who have jobs where they move but they're on their feet also have a higher chance of death.

640
00:41:12,712 --> 00:41:14,865
Speaker 0: Oh, I guess moving is not the solution.

641
00:41:14,885 --> 00:41:24,433
Speaker 1: then a bit It appears that the only way to eliminate to reduce that chance of death in these kinds of situations not working is to sit and Stand.

642
00:41:24,453 --> 00:41:27,105
Speaker 1: I'll be in about equal amounts over the course of your day.

643
00:41:27,628 --> 00:41:28,130
Speaker 0: That's what I do.

644
00:41:28,231 --> 00:41:29,669
Speaker 0: Anyway, even though I don't have a standing this.

645
00:41:29,817 --> 00:41:31,244
Speaker 1: Yeah most people do not do that.

646
00:41:31,608 --> 00:41:38,985
Speaker 1: but There is a caveat that it might be that most jobs that involve standing pay shit and low money Correlates to low bad life outcome.

647
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:42,270
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm And also those kinds of jobs tend to be more stressful.

648
00:41:42,793 --> 00:41:44,180
Speaker 0: It could be just that boring job.

649
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,709
Speaker 0: sitting at a desk also kills you.

650
00:41:46,091 --> 00:41:52,725
Speaker 0: No true just because it's regardless of whether you're sitting or standing at the desk The point is you're stuck at a desk all day and therefore you are dying.

651
00:41:52,906 --> 00:41:53,730
Speaker 0: Yep inside.

652
00:41:54,332 --> 00:41:56,702
Speaker 1: So, uh, what kind of desk do you have at home?

653
00:41:57,184 --> 00:41:58,530
Speaker 0: I have this desk from IKEA.

654
00:41:59,791 --> 00:42:05,853
Speaker 0: Before that I did the piece of wood on cinder blocks at RIT just as good but it was too big for a New York Apartment.

655
00:42:06,195 --> 00:42:07,563
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got an IKEA desk.

656
00:42:07,644 --> 00:42:14,125
Speaker 0: That is basically Three pieces of wood two vertical ones and a horizontal one and that's I love.

657
00:42:14,245 --> 00:42:19,981
Speaker 0: just having a big ass Flat generic space that I could then arrange things on.

658
00:42:20,302 --> 00:42:21,606
Speaker 0: no weird tears.

659
00:42:22,027 --> 00:42:27,390
Speaker 0: No, I used to like in college I think I had one with like a bit that went up a bit and then that wasn't good.

660
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,341
Speaker 0: I switched to the flat piece of wood.

661
00:42:29,381 --> 00:42:35,185
Speaker 1: See I really like Desks that have tears and spaces on them all over the place.

662
00:42:35,205 --> 00:42:37,689
Speaker 0: I do not need the tears and spaces I want a big flat thing.

663
00:42:38,052 --> 00:42:44,390
Speaker 1: But the best desk I ever had was just because we lived in Beacon I took the master bedroom because you got the walk-in closet.

664
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:46,117
Speaker 1: So I just got the giant ass bedroom instead.

665
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:51,240
Speaker 1: That bedroom was so big that I had one of those Gigantic L desks.

666
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:53,346
Speaker 0: All right, the desk was L-shaped Yeah Yeah.

667
00:42:53,631 --> 00:42:59,610
Speaker 1: And it also had and on the side the long side a tear with like more space for shit.

668
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:04,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, L-shaped is nice because it's basically, you know, you only can have two contacts in one space.

669
00:43:05,053 --> 00:43:07,070
Speaker 0: It's just a more more flat area.

670
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:11,870
Speaker 0: Right because normally even if I get the biggest and flattest piece of wood I get like a Warhammer table.

671
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:13,315
Speaker 0: It's like well, I can't reach the whole thing.

672
00:43:13,416 --> 00:43:19,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, but an L-shape was like, ah now I can reach even more flat space But I'm a big fan in my life.

673
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:20,012
Speaker 1: like this is.

674
00:43:20,072 --> 00:43:30,380
Speaker 1: one of those things that I actually put a lot of thought and investment into is that I like the idea of having separate spaces or separate Contacts for different kinds of tasks because it causes better focus.

675
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:33,970
Speaker 0: if I had more space to work with I definitely would be doing that.

676
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:38,810
Speaker 0: I'd have a different desk for like, you know, make it a. you know playing games or you know.

677
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:41,316
Speaker 0: I found a picture of my old desk.

678
00:43:41,517 --> 00:43:45,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know a different desk for like working on models and stuff.

679
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,737
Speaker 0: You know different desks for computing.

680
00:43:47,757 --> 00:43:49,121
Speaker 1: Look at that toricon poster.

681
00:43:49,141 --> 00:43:51,368
Speaker 1: It's an old fucking picture.

682
00:43:51,669 --> 00:43:54,196
Speaker 0: Anyway 2007 this picture.

683
00:43:54,376 --> 00:43:57,749
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the point is, you know, yeah, so it more desks is always better.

684
00:43:59,572 --> 00:44:00,194
Speaker 1: A giant house.

685
00:44:00,515 --> 00:44:03,965
Speaker 1: I'd have a room that was just the podcasting media streaming room.

686
00:44:03,985 --> 00:44:04,105
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

687
00:44:04,587 --> 00:44:05,650
Speaker 1: I'd have a separate room.

688
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:10,469
Speaker 1: That's the I'm gonna play some fucking games room and the tabletop room would probably be even another room.

689
00:44:10,692 --> 00:44:18,274
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I loved when I was a kid like the fact that we had a dining room that was separate from the eating like the food Preparation room.

690
00:44:18,797 --> 00:44:21,189
Speaker 0: I mean most people are probably like but I have that.

691
00:44:21,249 --> 00:44:27,499
Speaker 0: well You don't live in a tiny apartment where you suddenly don't have that and it's like I was able to get a dishwasher But I wasn't able to get a dining room.

692
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,807
Speaker 0: You know how much a dining room cause.

693
00:44:29,028 --> 00:44:32,970
Speaker 1: yeah I can't afford that or even just little things like when I lived in sterling heights.

694
00:44:33,413 --> 00:44:35,284
Speaker 1: We didn't really need a formal dining room.

695
00:44:35,324 --> 00:44:36,270
Speaker 1: So instead we had a library.

696
00:44:36,331 --> 00:44:37,261
Speaker 1: So we had a room in the house.

697
00:44:37,281 --> 00:44:38,090
Speaker 1: That was the library.

698
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:47,107
Speaker 1: I need a library and the great part about it was that I could sit in the fit in the living room If I was gonna like watch TV or we were all gonna watch a movie together.

699
00:44:47,207 --> 00:44:47,930
Speaker 1: that kind of context.

700
00:44:48,271 --> 00:44:56,000
Speaker 1: but I'd go to the library if I wanted to either talk to people with no distractions or Like read a book.

701
00:44:56,201 --> 00:45:08,501
Speaker 1: anyway, we got away from desks But so at the L desk I could face one way and have context one like working on shit But then I can just turn to the right and have a different context Despite only having one desk.

702
00:45:08,722 --> 00:45:10,150
Speaker 0: my desk at work is l-shaped.

703
00:45:11,071 --> 00:45:17,378
Speaker 0: And I've got you know, I've got the keyboard sort of in the cornering area and to the right of that I have like, you know some stuffs.

704
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:20,049
Speaker 0: and then to the left I have like a little decorative area.

705
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:23,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, you know, but if I need to switch tasks, I just move.

706
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:32,430
Speaker 0: I use actually a pat a pax branded CCG card gaming mat as like my mouse pad is like takes up a whole area.

707
00:45:33,331 --> 00:45:34,276
Speaker 0: Just to the left of that.

708
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:36,590
Speaker 0: I can do some writing and you know, whatever.

709
00:45:37,112 --> 00:45:44,883
Speaker 1: So I do the thing where cuz my desk at my current job has a. it's kind of it's like pretty big actually But it's like a straight on but it's wide enough to where.

710
00:45:44,983 --> 00:45:46,490
Speaker 1: it's big enough for two people to sit at it.

711
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:47,269
Speaker 1: But it's just me.

712
00:45:47,833 --> 00:45:57,190
Speaker 1: So what I do is I have an area to the right which like keyboard mouse and like no Computering and if I scoot to the left, I got an open area where I have like my drawing tablet and paper.

713
00:45:57,451 --> 00:45:59,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have an area to the left.

714
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,528
Speaker 0: It's just I put chat keys there.

715
00:46:00,809 --> 00:46:02,977
Speaker 1: Yep I uh, I don't have that here.

716
00:46:03,158 --> 00:46:16,350
Speaker 1: actually the current setup I have for the geek night studio like the desk I'm sitting at right now Not the greatest setup because I have too much shit that I use on a regular basis and there's not enough space to put it All that is also well organized.

717
00:46:17,093 --> 00:46:18,458
Speaker 0: Now let's talk about something else.

718
00:46:18,478 --> 00:46:21,770
Speaker 0: the desk has going on below which is some drawer action.

719
00:46:22,452 --> 00:46:24,641
Speaker 1: I want more drawers on my desk, right?

720
00:46:24,661 --> 00:46:26,387
Speaker 0: So that's the thing is like on the one hand, right?

721
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:31,890
Speaker 0: It's like I kind of like not having anything under there because moving around becomes real easy.

722
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:40,986
Speaker 0: But the fact is that when you get the big piece of wood, like I enjoy just a big flat area There's a more and more area on top for shit to accumulate.

723
00:46:41,026 --> 00:46:49,678
Speaker 0: the more area There is on the bottom and that area while you want to have it open so your legs can be there It's also pretty much a wasted area.

724
00:46:49,859 --> 00:46:52,510
Speaker 0: So you may as well put some kind of storage down there.

725
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:53,676
Speaker 0: You got to put something, you know, you're.

726
00:46:53,696 --> 00:46:56,530
Speaker 0: otherwise you're wasting space which in a tiny apartment is a problem.

727
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:59,542
Speaker 1: Well, I get a big house like who cares that room was so big?

728
00:46:59,582 --> 00:47:01,590
Speaker 1: I could put like six more desks that size, right?

729
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:08,310
Speaker 0: So if you don't have a space elsewhere and plus it's easy to get stuff if it's there if you put your stuff far away.

730
00:47:08,371 --> 00:47:10,149
Speaker 0: Now you got to go really far away to get your stuff.

731
00:47:10,671 --> 00:47:15,706
Speaker 0: So you want to put handy things you're gonna need while you're at your desk in drawers underneath the desk.

732
00:47:15,746 --> 00:47:17,150
Speaker 0: nice filing cabinet action.

733
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:19,056
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know all that kind of stuff.

734
00:47:19,096 --> 00:47:21,825
Speaker 0: So the drawers I have are actually it's.

735
00:47:22,046 --> 00:47:23,250
Speaker 0: it's actually a go.

736
00:47:23,331 --> 00:47:24,569
Speaker 0: It's like a set for my key.

737
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,649
Speaker 0: It goes with the desk.

738
00:47:26,031 --> 00:47:33,415
Speaker 0: But it's like a free rolling file cabinet that has two drawers and then one file drawer and I can take it out and roll It around if I want.

739
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:36,270
Speaker 0: but it just fits perfectly in that in the desk part.

740
00:47:36,692 --> 00:47:39,530
Speaker 0: But I can move it if I have to to the left to the right wherever.

741
00:47:40,092 --> 00:47:41,217
Speaker 0: So it's pretty good.

742
00:47:41,237 --> 00:47:44,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if I got an even bigger desk, I can get another one of those, right?

743
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:48,150
Speaker 0: But if I got a second one now, I wouldn't have enough legroom under there.

744
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:53,630
Speaker 1: So yeah, like right now I have enough legroom to stretch out, but it's literally just as wide as my legs.

745
00:47:53,931 --> 00:47:58,768
Speaker 1: Yep, cuz my computer's down there for reasons of venting heat and there's nowhere better to put it.

746
00:47:58,929 --> 00:48:19,330
Speaker 1: Yep so I Wish I Cuz then I could have a tiny computer that I would just like tape to the bottom of my desk And like just it would just be hanging from the desk and I'd never have to touch it or interact with it.

747
00:48:19,591 --> 00:48:21,399
Speaker 1: Is that the USB hub like sitting on top?

748
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:23,630
Speaker 1: Yep, but the reality is that's not true.

749
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:27,929
Speaker 1: I have a giant computer So I need that space down there for the computer to sit.

750
00:48:28,571 --> 00:48:31,640
Speaker 0: Cuz you can't actually put my computer next to the desk.

751
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:32,562
Speaker 1: I don't have room for that here.

752
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:32,984
Speaker 1: Actually.

753
00:48:33,004 --> 00:48:35,270
Speaker 0: I barely just enough room for that.

754
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:44,230
Speaker 1: yep, so I really Really really always want my desks to have the keyboard tray that is under the desk and comes out over my legs.

755
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:46,150
Speaker 0: No, I am against this.

756
00:48:46,351 --> 00:48:52,254
Speaker 0: I want the keyboard to be on the desk and that's why I need the big open space because the keyboards and the mouse are Taking up some of that space.

757
00:48:52,535 --> 00:48:56,350
Speaker 1: Look I can roll it out and deploy like my stuff on this nice area.

758
00:48:56,814 --> 00:48:58,347
Speaker 1: That's at the exact right height.

759
00:48:58,407 --> 00:49:00,414
Speaker 0: No Exact right height.

760
00:49:00,454 --> 00:49:01,077
Speaker 0: it needs to be higher.

761
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:02,363
Speaker 1: Why would I make higher?

762
00:49:02,383 --> 00:49:03,790
Speaker 1: It's the exact level of my own rest.

763
00:49:04,473 --> 00:49:06,603
Speaker 1: Too low, how is this too low too low?

764
00:49:06,623 --> 00:49:08,170
Speaker 1: gonna be typing like this like up?

765
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:09,233
Speaker 1: Why would you?

766
00:49:09,515 --> 00:49:11,430
Speaker 1: why would you do that to yourself and type all the way up here?

767
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:12,314
Speaker 0: That's that's not.

768
00:49:12,354 --> 00:49:14,950
Speaker 0: first of all, you're talking about a two inch difference, right?

769
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:15,797
Speaker 1: That's a big deal.

770
00:49:15,877 --> 00:49:17,269
Speaker 0: And second of all your arms are short.

771
00:49:18,131 --> 00:49:19,316
Speaker 1: My arms are longer than your arms.

772
00:49:19,798 --> 00:49:26,548
Speaker 0: Also when I sit in my chair whenever I get in a chair I always adjust it to a be reclining as much as possible.

773
00:49:26,568 --> 00:49:29,300
Speaker 1: cuz like Why don't you get a lay down desk?

774
00:49:29,622 --> 00:49:30,226
Speaker 0: That would be great.

775
00:49:30,387 --> 00:49:35,290
Speaker 0: Also I make the elevation of the chair as high as possible.

776
00:49:35,992 --> 00:49:40,729
Speaker 0: So even though you're saying oh, that's the right height for you as to love my knees be bumping into that shit.

777
00:49:41,251 --> 00:49:43,219
Speaker 1: Uh, my knees do not bump into this.

778
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:46,010
Speaker 0: is your air on chair as up high as it goes?

779
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:46,673
Speaker 1: Of course not.

780
00:49:46,713 --> 00:49:49,144
Speaker 1: my air on sure can go way higher than I possibly would ever need it to.

781
00:49:49,245 --> 00:49:49,707
Speaker 0: that's the thing.

782
00:49:49,727 --> 00:49:52,370
Speaker 0: is I if I Had that chair output at maximum height?

783
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:53,474
Speaker 0: Why there is a?

784
00:49:53,494 --> 00:49:56,524
Speaker 0: that is my most comfortable position is what I would if I could.

785
00:49:56,544 --> 00:49:58,150
Speaker 1: this is why you have a hump.

786
00:49:58,451 --> 00:50:02,090
Speaker 0: I would have my chair be up like so I could kiss giraffes on the lips.

787
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:10,249
Speaker 1: This is why you're gonna be a hunchback when you're old because you sit weird and it seems like it's not just your backslouch But it's every aspect of your being.

788
00:50:11,135 --> 00:50:11,989
Speaker 0: Gotta be up high.

789
00:50:13,114 --> 00:50:14,318
Speaker 1: The plebs got to be a pilot.

790
00:50:14,438 --> 00:50:17,809
Speaker 1: So when you're sitting in your chair like working on stuff are your feet?

791
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:21,229
Speaker 1: Dangling touching the ground or flat on the ground?

792
00:50:21,531 --> 00:50:24,269
Speaker 0: It depends on where I am because I have different chairs at work and home.

793
00:50:24,591 --> 00:50:28,830
Speaker 0: But I would most prefer my feet to be dangling and floating in the air like dangling.

794
00:50:28,931 --> 00:50:30,582
Speaker 1: So I ever dangling is bad news.

795
00:50:30,622 --> 00:50:32,352
Speaker 1: dangling is not great for you Who cares?

796
00:50:32,452 --> 00:50:36,607
Speaker 1: it also decreases comfort over time unless you're weird and I guess the hunch is giving you like.

797
00:50:36,648 --> 00:50:45,130
Speaker 0: I love it when you Go to like a restaurant and they have those really tall stools only if they got the platforms You can hook your feet around the snow platform and you're gonna go.

798
00:50:46,011 --> 00:50:49,285
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could spin around in a circle and hang the feet on the platform.

799
00:50:49,345 --> 00:50:50,410
Speaker 0: No, no platform.

800
00:50:51,135 --> 00:50:56,001
Speaker 1: I want my feet to be planted flat on the ground No on my thighs to be facing straight forward.

801
00:50:56,021 --> 00:50:58,050
Speaker 1: So my knees are like this 90-degree angle.

802
00:50:58,712 --> 00:50:59,977
Speaker 1: That is the perfect way to sit.

803
00:51:00,118 --> 00:51:09,959
Speaker 0: The only benefit that I must admit of the keyboard drawer is That when your keyboard is hidden away in the keyboard drawer You can eat at your desk without food getting in it.

804
00:51:10,039 --> 00:51:18,716
Speaker 0: I would not have a million everything bagel crumbs Yeah seeds in my keyboard, but that is a small price to pay for having my keyboard out on top You know in the right.

805
00:51:18,898 --> 00:51:30,590
Speaker 1: so for the longest time I've always been a fan of if I have to get a desk that isn't a gigantic L then I like the Compact computer desk that have a bunch of vertical space in them to use that space up.

806
00:51:30,932 --> 00:51:32,003
Speaker 0: See, I'm I don't.

807
00:51:32,549 --> 00:51:37,184
Speaker 0: well I'm not super against having the vertical stuff because I do like more storage space.

808
00:51:37,285 --> 00:51:40,092
Speaker 0: right and just an empty wall is not Restored.

809
00:51:40,112 --> 00:51:41,115
Speaker 1: I use it for active things.

810
00:51:41,195 --> 00:51:45,027
Speaker 1: Like the the compressor is literally like mounted on my desk up there.

811
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:47,033
Speaker 0: It's storage But it's.

812
00:51:47,234 --> 00:51:48,478
Speaker 1: it's more like a control interface.

813
00:51:48,519 --> 00:51:51,430
Speaker 0: it's used to say it's it's a thing it's being stored there.

814
00:51:51,531 --> 00:51:52,296
Speaker 0: I you give your didn't?

815
00:51:52,538 --> 00:51:54,190
Speaker 0: you couldn't store that on an empty wall.

816
00:51:54,331 --> 00:51:58,590
Speaker 1: Well, then by that logic a desk is just storage - it is what we're talking about is separately.

817
00:51:58,691 --> 00:52:01,432
Speaker 1: It is because it's also a workspace It's.

818
00:52:01,533 --> 00:52:03,961
Speaker 0: it's just a shelf that you interact with the things on more.

819
00:52:04,002 --> 00:52:06,250
Speaker 1: so access its access more than storage.

820
00:52:06,672 --> 00:52:08,442
Speaker 0: It's a more easily accessed shelf.

821
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:09,950
Speaker 0: It's a shelf you can access while sitting.

822
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:12,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would say that but I wouldn't go so far as to call it storage.

823
00:52:13,403 --> 00:52:13,965
Speaker 0: It's storage.

824
00:52:14,467 --> 00:52:15,109
Speaker 1: Is it stowage?

825
00:52:16,251 --> 00:52:17,938
Speaker 0: No, yeah, it's just story.

826
00:52:18,801 --> 00:52:19,966
Speaker 1: but the problem.

827
00:52:19,986 --> 00:52:32,290
Speaker 1: so this was great Through most of my life and computing but now we're in an era Where I can get really fucking gigantic monitors that don't fit in the spaces that exist on those deaths.

828
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:39,210
Speaker 1: So right now the vertical part on this desk was great until I got a really big monitor And now the monitor has to be in front of that.

829
00:52:39,471 --> 00:52:40,558
Speaker 0: It is really strange.

830
00:52:40,618 --> 00:52:42,530
Speaker 0: how like I had 17 inch monitors, right?

831
00:52:42,932 --> 00:52:45,944
Speaker 0: And then as time went on people are getting 19 inches and I looked at that.

832
00:52:45,984 --> 00:52:48,575
Speaker 0: I'm like, it's too big I don't need that big right?

833
00:52:48,656 --> 00:52:49,178
Speaker 0: I don't want more.

834
00:52:49,218 --> 00:52:53,576
Speaker 0: I want more resolution smaller pixels better screen But I don't anything bigger than 17 now.

835
00:52:53,596 --> 00:52:54,960
Speaker 0: My monitors are 24 inches.

836
00:52:55,522 --> 00:52:58,010
Speaker 1: They're 16 by 10 and I'm looking at even bigger one.

837
00:52:58,812 --> 00:53:08,902
Speaker 0: I see I see 27 inch monitors and I'm like those aren't too big and I see people buying 34 inch monitors I had at one time.

838
00:53:08,942 --> 00:53:14,019
Speaker 0: I currently have a 40 inch television as My television and I don't need a big.

839
00:53:14,099 --> 00:53:16,829
Speaker 1: I have a I have a 52 and I would never go bigger than that.

840
00:53:17,312 --> 00:53:18,561
Speaker 0: No, 50 just too big.

841
00:53:18,621 --> 00:53:20,271
Speaker 1: but well for your apartment It would be.

842
00:53:20,532 --> 00:53:29,460
Speaker 0: I only have a 40 inch TV because the 37 inch that I replaced They couldn't get another 37. but 34 to 37 adds a really small difference.

843
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:34,656
Speaker 0: Yeah But it's like yet.

844
00:53:34,676 --> 00:53:36,570
Speaker 0: They don't there's not a lot of furniture out there.

845
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:41,022
Speaker 0: They can like accommodate these bigger monitors, especially in the small apartment, right?

846
00:53:41,082 --> 00:53:46,929
Speaker 0: I have two 24 inch monitors on my desk now on arms That are mounted to the back of the desk.

847
00:53:47,471 --> 00:53:53,210
Speaker 0: But like if I had to go to bigger monitors, like I couldn't I need to basically stick with 24 inch monitors.

848
00:53:53,419 --> 00:53:56,599
Speaker 1: Yep So the only way to fit two monitors on this desk is right now.

849
00:53:56,659 --> 00:53:59,588
Speaker 1: my secondary monitor is a shockingly ancient 4x3.

850
00:54:00,371 --> 00:54:03,191
Speaker 0: That's at the 17 that I had in like 2002.

851
00:54:03,191 --> 00:54:10,858
Speaker 1: But also that number is different because that number if you measure something diagonally a rectangle is a very different profile Depending on its aspect ratio.

852
00:54:10,938 --> 00:54:13,270
Speaker 0: Even if you want to measure it the area is way small.

853
00:54:13,531 --> 00:54:21,763
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if I get a bigger monitor than what I have now I cannot have a second monitor unless that second monitor is very much to that monitor.

854
00:54:21,763 --> 00:54:24,371
Speaker 0: 1280 by 1024.

855
00:54:24,371 --> 00:54:25,576
Speaker 1: No, this one's higher than that.

856
00:54:25,617 --> 00:54:26,561
Speaker 0: No the 17 inch one.

857
00:54:26,922 --> 00:54:28,167
Speaker 1: Oh that one is 1280, right?

858
00:54:29,031 --> 00:54:29,473
Speaker 0: I think so.

859
00:54:29,593 --> 00:54:30,678
Speaker 0: And this other one is 1600 by or 19.

860
00:54:30,678 --> 00:54:35,832
Speaker 0: This one's 1920 by 1200 1200.

861
00:54:35,832 --> 00:54:36,696
Speaker 0: Yeah.

862
00:54:36,736 --> 00:54:37,238
Speaker 1: Yeah.

863
00:54:38,261 --> 00:54:38,683
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

864
00:54:38,703 --> 00:54:39,325
Speaker 1: I found this picture.

865
00:54:39,345 --> 00:54:40,510
Speaker 1: I was looking at pictures of my old desk.

866
00:54:40,951 --> 00:54:42,777
Speaker 1: So I've got the 19 inch CRT.

867
00:54:42,838 --> 00:54:45,747
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, and there's magic in this picture.

868
00:54:45,767 --> 00:54:46,510
Speaker 1: You see the old mixer.

869
00:54:46,871 --> 00:54:55,529
Speaker 1: You see my old flip phone before smartphones a Neal Stevenson book the shittiest raddest ass They the keyboard shelf with my old Logitech keyboard down there.

870
00:54:56,554 --> 00:54:59,390
Speaker 1: And you can see in this little screenshot that I'm running.

871
00:55:00,813 --> 00:55:04,447
Speaker 1: Katie it looks like Good old times.

872
00:55:05,693 --> 00:55:17,710
Speaker 1: but yeah, the problem with the vertical space now too is that The vertical stuff was really useful in the previous places I had lived up until now in my entire life because the ceilings weren't that high.

873
00:55:18,152 --> 00:55:22,970
Speaker 0: They made the most use of that space and putting shelves on the wall just kind of is hard and sucks.

874
00:55:23,415 --> 00:55:35,866
Speaker 1: But now that I live in a Finding and like modern luxury apartments have really high ceilings compared to the average ceilings in most of America Like that's been the trend if you get a fancy house now, you'll get like 13 14 foot ceilings.

875
00:55:37,692 --> 00:55:43,090
Speaker 1: The highest vertical desk there's still like five feet above the desk that I'd still have to put shelves in.

876
00:55:43,533 --> 00:55:46,010
Speaker 1: I can't have a desk that will use up all that space.

877
00:55:46,331 --> 00:55:51,490
Speaker 1: So it almost be easier to just put shelves in all the way up in the first place then bother getting the vertical desk.

878
00:55:52,832 --> 00:55:55,805
Speaker 1: But I already have the vertical desk and I don't want to just replace the desk.

879
00:55:55,825 --> 00:55:56,850
Speaker 1: that's even more of a pain.

880
00:55:57,030 --> 00:56:01,005
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I do want to talk about like a lot of deaths like the IKEA desk.

881
00:56:01,045 --> 00:56:02,310
Speaker 0: I have it's fun, right?

882
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:03,204
Speaker 0: Yeah But it's like.

883
00:56:03,932 --> 00:56:13,321
Speaker 0: You know when I was a kid the desk I had that came with like the children's furniture that then lasted me all the way to high school Was actually made of like for serious wood.

884
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:13,863
Speaker 0: like.

885
00:56:14,183 --> 00:56:16,410
Speaker 0: it had three drawers and not a lot of space.

886
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:25,270
Speaker 0: But I was able to get my you know 15 inch CRT on there with my computer on the floor, you know with my Pentium 3 for a couple years.

887
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:25,691
Speaker 0: It wasn't.

888
00:56:25,992 --> 00:56:27,698
Speaker 0: it worked, you know, it managed.

889
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:33,000
Speaker 0: but like it was serious furniture like wow This is solid super wood.

890
00:56:33,261 --> 00:56:34,650
Speaker 0: It lasted all that time.

891
00:56:34,951 --> 00:56:37,986
Speaker 0: You could easily move it to another house or sell it to someone.

892
00:56:38,026 --> 00:56:38,770
Speaker 0: no problem, right?

893
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:43,268
Speaker 0: The IKEA desk I bought in college like disintegrated the first time I tried to move it.

894
00:56:44,052 --> 00:56:49,390
Speaker 0: That's the rule and that's why I switched to cinder blocks with a plank because that didn't fall apart.

895
00:56:49,733 --> 00:56:51,489
Speaker 0: It did but you could put it right back together again.

896
00:56:52,253 --> 00:56:56,469
Speaker 0: And the IKEA desk I have now while just fine actually had a bunch of peeling going on.

897
00:56:56,798 --> 00:57:03,350
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Look look at all this like cosmetic damage that's accumulating right and if I have to move basically just got throw it out and recycle.

898
00:57:03,591 --> 00:57:04,657
Speaker 0: It's completely on.

899
00:57:04,758 --> 00:57:06,286
Speaker 0: it's because it's so shitty and chintzy.

900
00:57:06,709 --> 00:57:16,309
Speaker 0: now I do see people who still have fancy desk these days with serious wood usually like executive desks and I do like those In one hand, but they tend to waste a lot of space, right?

901
00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:21,720
Speaker 0: Because they're so big and ah, and so solid which is good But they're pretty much worse than every other way.

902
00:57:21,781 --> 00:57:31,049
Speaker 0: besides bigness and solidness often They have weird shapes and they're ornate and they're not uncomfortable to sit under and they're not made designed with computers in mind.

903
00:57:31,149 --> 00:57:34,598
Speaker 1: So When we first moved to this apartment, we got bookshelves.

904
00:57:34,639 --> 00:57:37,850
Speaker 1: We got these like really nice leaning bookshelves for the bedroom.

905
00:57:37,951 --> 00:57:44,910
Speaker 1: I really like that aesthetic and they hold off crazy ton of books, too Like this is really nice and they go right up flush against the wall.

906
00:57:44,991 --> 00:57:46,249
Speaker 1: There's a lot of reason I like these shelves.

907
00:57:46,852 --> 00:57:51,790
Speaker 1: But there was an option because they're modular you can get them as many segments of these leaning shelves as you want.

908
00:57:52,632 --> 00:57:56,703
Speaker 1: You could replace one of those segments with a really minimalist desk.

909
00:57:57,164 --> 00:57:58,648
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, and then the shelves go up.

910
00:57:59,349 --> 00:58:05,941
Speaker 1: and If I didn't have all this audio mixing equipment nonsense because I like.

911
00:58:06,041 --> 00:58:08,164
Speaker 1: I do stuff that normal people don't do with their computers.

912
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:22,150
Speaker 1: I Because what I'd have is like a Microsoft Surface Book or something or a laptop of some kind to be my primary computer and I would just set it there on this really minimalist desk and it would be great.

913
00:58:22,331 --> 00:58:24,358
Speaker 1: Like that would be almost the ideal solution.

914
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:27,850
Speaker 0: Well, I think you know if you had like two living places, right?

915
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:29,517
Speaker 1: So like if I that's the desk I'd have.

916
00:58:29,537 --> 00:58:31,125
Speaker 1: we bought a house upstate to store stuff in.

917
00:58:31,145 --> 00:58:37,286
Speaker 0: right if I'm a big house Somewhere we're actually like, you know, like workshops and things or I have they might.

918
00:58:37,326 --> 00:58:48,043
Speaker 0: my New York City apartment Just becomes this minimalist You know place just to live while in the city and then it can have really tiny stuff like that because who's no one's gonna Have a desktop computer in such a minimalist place.

919
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:52,528
Speaker 1: or if I had a bigger house What I do is like there'd be shelves like that in most of the rooms because that's what you do.

920
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:59,638
Speaker 1: I probably just have a little minimal desk along the wall in almost every room because if you're just in a room and you want To like do some work.

921
00:58:59,699 --> 00:59:00,689
Speaker 1: It's a nice thing.

922
00:59:01,231 --> 00:59:05,947
Speaker 1: I like having workspaces and other places again just to give myself a better way to change contexts.

923
00:59:06,147 --> 00:59:08,195
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Alright, but yeah, it's.

924
00:59:08,275 --> 00:59:20,039
Speaker 0: it's sad that desk these days are hard to come by made of high-quality materials that you you know are actually a serious piece of furniture, you know as opposed to You know some chintzy basic plank.

925
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,990
Speaker 0: I mean, you know who knows what kind of particle crap.

926
00:59:23,231 --> 00:59:26,070
Speaker 1: So actually this one is real sturdy.

927
00:59:26,291 --> 00:59:30,288
Speaker 0: Otherwise, I mean mine is mine is sturdy because it's only three pieces of whatever it is.

928
00:59:30,971 --> 00:59:34,970
Speaker 1: But it this desk I'm pretty sure I don't move without it breaking.

929
00:59:35,131 --> 00:59:37,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could probably take apart the three pieces and put it back together.

930
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:40,926
Speaker 0: I think it does actually have a fourth piece or just like some sort of backing plate.

931
00:59:40,946 --> 00:59:45,307
Speaker 0: That's not necessary Yeah, and maybe provide some structural integrity, but not really.

932
00:59:45,327 --> 00:59:48,541
Speaker 0: it's real thin But it's like you wouldn't you would.

933
00:59:48,561 --> 00:59:50,770
Speaker 0: just you're better off just getting rid of it because it's so cheap.

934
00:59:51,393 --> 00:59:55,813
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the biggest constraint I have on desks is that For a variety of reasons.

935
00:59:55,874 --> 01:00:13,530
Speaker 1: I have a large number of control surfaces to which I need access and peripherals like drawing tablet The knob two keyboards one for gaming and one for typing the giant ass mixer the compressor the streaming crap And then now like all these USB chargers everywhere.

936
01:00:14,015 --> 01:00:21,147
Speaker 1: So I have all these like extra Constraints that mean it's almost harder for me to find a desk than just a normal person using normal computers for normal things.

937
01:00:21,447 --> 01:00:21,568
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

938
01:00:22,733 --> 01:00:24,949
Speaker 1: But I wonder what are the people?

939
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:27,757
Speaker 1: Who don't have computers?

940
01:00:27,797 --> 01:00:30,850
Speaker 1: do they just not have desks like the people who just have an iPad or their phone?

941
01:00:31,556 --> 01:00:33,491
Speaker 0: I see, you know when I go to people's houses like

942
01:00:33,531 --> 01:00:34,494
Speaker 1: I don't see desks

943
01:00:34,956 --> 01:00:41,304
Speaker 0: at least from what I remember of going to people's houses like people have their computer does like in the 90s when I you know, it goes either in

944
01:00:41,344 --> 01:00:42,049
Speaker 1: the kid like in the

945
01:00:42,953 --> 01:00:54,710
Speaker 0: Other people's houses and everyone had a different weird situation for their computer desk Like even ours was like, you know, I had mine in my room But like the family computer was like in the kitchen on this weird like non desk table

946
01:00:54,791 --> 01:00:56,549
Speaker 1: It was like real calm.

947
01:00:57,551 --> 01:01:01,150
Speaker 0: It's like people's houses weren't made to accommodate a computer.

948
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:13,270
Speaker 0: so everyone in the 90s like found a place that was so random and to like shove a desk that was covered in papers and CD-roms and a printer Right and except the computer on it and it like it made me in the basement.

949
01:01:13,391 --> 01:01:15,548
Speaker 0: Some people it's like all over the place my aunt

950
01:01:15,568 --> 01:01:24,669
Speaker 1: and uncle I remember I was always jealous because I had a bigger house than us when I was really young and they had a den And that room became the computer room and there were a bunch of computers in there.

951
01:01:25,352 --> 01:01:26,577
Speaker 1: Also, they were nerds and they were.

952
01:01:26,818 --> 01:01:27,622
Speaker 1: they were computers.

953
01:01:27,722 --> 01:01:31,615
Speaker 1: I wanted to have their computers too Because we didn't have computer right away.

954
01:01:31,635 --> 01:01:36,010
Speaker 1: And when we did it went into the dining area, which was connected to the kitchen.

955
01:01:36,331 --> 01:01:45,070
Speaker 0: I do think though nowadays more modern people's if you don't need the big computer I think a lot of people don't need the desk because everyone's got tablet phone whatever.

956
01:01:45,252 --> 01:01:47,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the desk is going away.

957
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,098
Speaker 1: They sit at the table or you know what.

958
01:01:49,118 --> 01:01:50,906
Speaker 0: you don't need a desk because there's a thing.

959
01:01:51,187 --> 01:01:52,577
Speaker 0: back in the day You would have a desk.

960
01:01:52,819 --> 01:01:56,820
Speaker 0: it's like do paperworks and things But now you don't do those anymore because you do everything on a computer.

961
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:59,610
Speaker 0: Yeah now your computer isn't a computer anymore.

962
01:01:59,831 --> 01:02:02,929
Speaker 0: It's just your phone or a tablet or something or a laptop.

963
01:02:04,232 --> 01:02:07,589
Speaker 0: So you just do on the couch and use a coffee table or whatever.

964
01:02:07,951 --> 01:02:09,681
Speaker 1: Yeah, or you get it to get a TV tray or one of the.

965
01:02:09,922 --> 01:02:21,944
Speaker 1: I see a lot of people get those Trays that you sit over you like a breakfast in bed tray But it's just for a pillow with a piece of wood attached to it that thing That or more substantial ones that are actually a tray with legs.

966
01:02:21,984 --> 01:02:23,350
Speaker 1: that's like a mini table, right?

967
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:28,390
Speaker 0: But like if you're not if you don't need a desktop computer, you don't need a desk in the year 2017.

968
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:31,920
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah a top computer even though it's under my desk.

969
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:33,785
Speaker 1: Yeah, because the world changed.

970
01:02:34,266 --> 01:02:38,263
Speaker 1: so it's a desk under computer Mm-hmm, and I'm one of those people who uses desk under computers.

971
01:02:38,303 --> 01:02:41,494
Speaker 1: So I need a desk to put it under And that's that.

972
01:02:42,257 --> 01:02:45,710
Speaker 1: I still can't believe you don't like the the tray that comes out for the keyboard.

973
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:46,936
Speaker 0: I don't like the key that comes out.

974
01:02:47,117 --> 01:02:48,102
Speaker 0: I just also it's.

975
01:02:48,182 --> 01:02:49,770
Speaker 0: it's just in practice.

976
01:02:49,790 --> 01:02:56,879
Speaker 0: I mean a lot of them are obviously yours still functions But many people have a get a flimsy one that just fall

977
01:02:57,020 --> 01:03:04,170
Speaker 1: in a flimsy keyboard tray is worse than no keyboard tray Mm-hmm kind of like if you go on an old airline and you open the tray and it kind of just sags.

978
01:03:05,411 --> 01:03:06,334
Speaker 0: You can't have sag.

979
01:03:06,374 --> 01:03:07,919
Speaker 1: if there's sag just tear the thing off.

980
01:03:07,939 --> 01:03:08,260
Speaker 0: Yep.

981
01:03:10,426 --> 01:03:11,450
