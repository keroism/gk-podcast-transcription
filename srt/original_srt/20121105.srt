1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,549
Speaker 1: It's November 5th, 2012.

2
00:00:11,549 --> 00:00:12,051
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,392 --> 00:00:16,706
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and it's got Fox day Tonight, we're talking about.

4
00:00:16,746 --> 00:00:18,895
Speaker 0: you can go check yourself.

5
00:00:18,915 --> 00:00:19,979
Speaker 1: It's a box with a bomb.

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,742
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:22,762 --> 00:00:26,751
Speaker 0: Oh wait.

8
00:00:26,771 --> 00:00:28,715
Speaker 1: I guess you haven't seen slayers.

9
00:00:28,815 --> 00:00:29,436
Speaker 1: try yet.

10
00:00:29,456 --> 00:00:31,160
Speaker 1: You don't know about the fox with bombs.

11
00:00:32,201 --> 00:00:33,205
Speaker 0: You and your foxes bomb.

12
00:00:33,527 --> 00:00:35,314
Speaker 1: you're gonna like that box and his bomb.

13
00:00:35,414 --> 00:00:36,780
Speaker 0: I can imagine the fox with bombs.

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,567
Speaker 0: I probably you know almost like.

15
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:42,059
Speaker 0: it's like there's a picture of one of my brain, and I'm pretty sure it'll match up.

16
00:00:43,362 --> 00:00:47,320
Speaker 0: When I see the one that is the one you were talking about at one point gallery eats one of his bombs.

17
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:48,768
Speaker 0: I think why wouldn't you?

18
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:57,100
Speaker 1: he was hungry, so yeah, yeah But I remember the fifth of November primarily because that's when I got my first job in the financial sector and started making money.

19
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:04,471
Speaker 0: I didn't remember at all until some tweets talked about how most people you know talk about it But don't actually know anything about it.

20
00:01:04,593 --> 00:01:05,719
Speaker 1: You know anything about it?

21
00:01:06,222 --> 00:01:07,770
Speaker 0: There was a dude named Guy Fawkes.

22
00:01:07,851 --> 00:01:08,273
Speaker 0: Yes.

23
00:01:08,494 --> 00:01:10,309
Speaker 0: He was a crazy monarchist.

24
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:15,217
Speaker 0: yes He tried to bomb the Parliament in England.

25
00:01:15,398 --> 00:01:20,639
Speaker 0: in London He put a bunch of gunpowder in some barrels in the basement, and he's about to light it.

26
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:32,734
Speaker 0: They caught him pretty much yeah, and he's basically like the Unabomber And he sort of looked like the v-mask but not really.

27
00:01:32,794 --> 00:01:34,940
Speaker 0: but pictures of him look like that right the same way.

28
00:01:35,282 --> 00:01:37,033
Speaker 0: You know what we think George Washington looked like.

29
00:01:37,073 --> 00:01:42,000
Speaker 0: he probably looked a little different You know because you know paintings of them don't look exactly the way he looked.

30
00:01:42,522 --> 00:01:44,733
Speaker 0: I don't think there's any photographs of George Washington.

31
00:01:44,794 --> 00:01:45,638
Speaker 0: right well.

32
00:01:45,658 --> 00:01:46,060
Speaker 1: We gotta wait.

33
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,790
Speaker 1: There's got to be some guy on a TV George Washington.

34
00:01:49,810 --> 00:02:05,752
Speaker 0: so on the fifth of November right the tradition in The UK is to you know wear the mask or whatever while you know making sort of a a dummy Out of you know to to be Guy Fawkes and then setting him on fire

35
00:02:05,873 --> 00:02:07,096
Speaker 1: as it burns like an effigy

36
00:02:07,257 --> 00:02:07,919
Speaker 0: as an effigy.

37
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,020
Speaker 0: So sort of be like you know it'd be like if we have we maybe put a hoodie on a guy.

38
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,267
Speaker 0: I was like it's the Unabomber.

39
00:02:13,327 --> 00:02:14,855
Speaker 0: Let's fuck him and set him on fire.

40
00:02:15,076 --> 00:02:21,867
Speaker 0: so the other Not in the literal sense One of the other nothing fucks like an effigy.

41
00:02:21,887 --> 00:02:23,532
Speaker 0: There's a hundred definitions of fuck.

42
00:02:23,672 --> 00:02:25,197
Speaker 0: We're not talking about the sexual one.

43
00:02:25,217 --> 00:02:36,175
Speaker 1: so the reason I think about it is that on October 5th the Fake Twitter account for Archer like the character Archer tweeted something about Guy Fawkes day.

44
00:02:36,195 --> 00:02:37,620
Speaker 0: I don't think you got it wrong.

45
00:02:37,901 --> 00:02:41,031
Speaker 0: Yep, was that an intentional joke or guessing?

46
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:43,500
Speaker 0: it was person who had that account was dumb.

47
00:02:43,802 --> 00:02:45,760
Speaker 0: I don't remember the fifth of October.

48
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:54,538
Speaker 1: I am guessing the latter, but someone responded elegantly and they were like ah yes the rhyme says it well remember remember the fifth of October.

49
00:02:55,887 --> 00:03:07,010
Speaker 0: Yeah Remember it well It was ten five and I'm sure it in 2015 someone's gonna be like oh my god It's 1015 2015. lots of ones and fives.

50
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,375
Speaker 1: I was up in Albany this weekend.

51
00:03:08,395 --> 00:03:15,180
Speaker 1: I went to visit a distillery Okay, where they distill spirits, and I tried to say legal distillery was any moonshine.

52
00:03:15,421 --> 00:03:18,099
Speaker 1: So it was a legal one and the guy who runs it was totally chill.

53
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:18,280
Speaker 1: one.

54
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,905
Speaker 1: He was like this isn't moonshine.

55
00:03:19,925 --> 00:03:20,989
Speaker 1: and two.

56
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:21,892
Speaker 1: he was like.

57
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,099
Speaker 1: we asked him a lot of questions as Pete was there.

58
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:25,600
Speaker 1: Pete You know Pete knows this stuff.

59
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:25,684
Speaker 0: Yep.

60
00:03:26,242 --> 00:03:32,160
Speaker 1: So one point where we had I think we asked him something like Does it matter if you do this and that in the distilling process?

61
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,187
Speaker 1: He was like it doesn't matter for fucking shit.

62
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:35,371
Speaker 1: You're distilling it.

63
00:03:35,391 --> 00:03:38,020
Speaker 1: You're removing 99% of anything that was in there.

64
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,622
Speaker 0: That's right.

65
00:03:39,024 --> 00:03:46,680
Speaker 1: He was like we do what matters and we don't do what doesn't matter and he was totally chill in science Mm-hmm, so I bought a very large bottle of vodka made from apple cores.

66
00:03:47,382 --> 00:03:48,907
Speaker 0: I thought vodka is made from potatoes.

67
00:03:48,927 --> 00:03:51,495
Speaker 1: Well it can be made from basically anything vodka.

68
00:03:51,836 --> 00:04:04,525
Speaker 1: Here's the thing in the US Americans like vodka to be grain neutral meaning it tastes like Nothing, but alcohol because they use it to make silly frou-frou bullshit drinks, and they don't like the taste of alcohol But they want to get drunk.

69
00:04:04,685 --> 00:04:10,168
Speaker 1: that is a vodak tastes like so when an American you know when people say they like gray Goose or one of those like good vodkas.

70
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:11,935
Speaker 0: They actually smelled that.

71
00:04:11,995 --> 00:04:13,300
Speaker 0: it smelled like alcohol.

72
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:15,175
Speaker 1: Yeah, they want something that doesn't taste like anything.

73
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:16,503
Speaker 1: so in Russia It smells like.

74
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:17,648
Speaker 0: it tastes like alcohol.

75
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,480
Speaker 1: in Russia good vodka tastes like fucking potatoes.

76
00:04:21,165 --> 00:04:25,769
Speaker 0: I imagined it does but in America It tastes like nothing even though potato tastes good.

77
00:04:25,809 --> 00:04:26,452
Speaker 0: would you agree?

78
00:04:26,552 --> 00:04:28,780
Speaker 0: potato chip baked potato right potato?

79
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,760
Speaker 0: You would not want to eat a plain of raw potato that does not taste good.

80
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:36,891
Speaker 0: You need to do something to it to make it not taste like that.

81
00:04:37,132 --> 00:04:41,426
Speaker 1: so anyway this core vodka is made from apple cores But it's not well.

82
00:04:41,526 --> 00:04:44,376
Speaker 0: apple cores on tastes like apple, and is there an arsenic situation.

83
00:04:44,396 --> 00:04:49,440
Speaker 1: No it's not arsenic It's cyanide for one either one which not only.

84
00:04:50,421 --> 00:04:52,748
Speaker 0: Not only is the percentage so small it doesn't matter.

85
00:04:52,808 --> 00:04:56,479
Speaker 1: yeah, so you read the name of the wind right.

86
00:04:56,499 --> 00:04:58,085
Speaker 0: yeah That comes up there.

87
00:04:58,105 --> 00:05:01,197
Speaker 1: I know the girl is like isn't there arsenic in this bullshit.

88
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:01,518
Speaker 1: He's like.

89
00:05:01,538 --> 00:05:03,044
Speaker 1: well one It's actually cyanide.

90
00:05:03,104 --> 00:05:06,355
Speaker 0: I'm glad that you got my reference far too late thinking.

91
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:07,720
Speaker 0: I was not making a reference.

92
00:05:07,761 --> 00:05:14,580
Speaker 1: I got the reference right away, however I knew you and I was wondering if you in fact had it wrong and forgot that that was brought up in the book.

93
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:15,444
Speaker 0: No, I know.

94
00:05:15,464 --> 00:05:22,031
Speaker 1: I do enjoy however how the dragons going nuts And then they realize I go you can't save this with a book club episode.

95
00:05:22,092 --> 00:05:24,660
Speaker 1: There's basically a meth lab out here in the forest.

96
00:05:28,222 --> 00:05:28,905
Speaker 1: That was a good scene.

97
00:05:28,945 --> 00:05:29,426
Speaker 1: I like that.

98
00:05:29,446 --> 00:05:33,380
Speaker 1: yeah, I finished the book on the subway home, so okay about that.

99
00:05:33,802 --> 00:05:34,808
Speaker 1: I'll save that for the matter moment.

100
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:35,452
Speaker 0: shall we move on?

101
00:05:35,694 --> 00:05:43,720
Speaker 1: yeah, we can move on but anyway I am drinking the Applejack right now because they made core vodka which tastes It's like vodka with a hint of Apple instead of a hint of potato.

102
00:05:44,242 --> 00:05:45,366
Speaker 1: It's really fucking good.

103
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,538
Speaker 0: and to don't drink how much him what amount of it.

104
00:05:48,558 --> 00:05:49,080
Speaker 0: can you drink?

105
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,686
Speaker 0: That's basically what proof is that?

106
00:05:51,028 --> 00:05:52,373
Speaker 1: It's 80 proof.

107
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,020
Speaker 0: You're drinking a very small amount.

108
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,583
Speaker 1: Yes, this is 40% so that much of this glass is pure Grain alcohol.

109
00:05:58,623 --> 00:06:01,254
Speaker 0: should you not maybe put something in there besides that?

110
00:06:01,454 --> 00:06:02,800
Speaker 0: no how about a slice of Apple?

111
00:06:03,761 --> 00:06:04,426
Speaker 1: I guess I could do that.

112
00:06:04,466 --> 00:06:07,106
Speaker 0: the thing is this is what variety of Apple Did they use?

113
00:06:07,268 --> 00:06:08,660
Speaker 1: you know what that was asked?

114
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,725
Speaker 1: You know what the distiller said.

115
00:06:09,746 --> 00:06:11,394
Speaker 1: mm-hmm doesn't fucking matter.

116
00:06:11,695 --> 00:06:12,520
Speaker 0: What do you matters?

117
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,683
Speaker 1: You it doesn't matter.

118
00:06:13,743 --> 00:06:16,414
Speaker 0: I say you make it twice once with Fuji once with.

119
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,820
Speaker 0: yeah, you know what he's there.

120
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,683
Speaker 1: You distill it.

121
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:20,149
Speaker 1: There's no difference.

122
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,338
Speaker 0: There's some Apple flavor in there is there not?

123
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:24,840
Speaker 0: yes What Apple flavor does it taste like Apple?

124
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:29,117
Speaker 1: So like the Apple do you want to try to say every time Apple this tastes like I?

125
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:36,513
Speaker 0: It's probably tastes like Apple juices every Apple mixed together If you use only one kind of Apple in one and only what he uses.

126
00:06:36,553 --> 00:06:38,720
Speaker 1: cider apples whatever cider apples.

127
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:40,396
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what Apple Jack is I?

128
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,984
Speaker 0: Apples that fell on the ground.

129
00:06:42,004 --> 00:06:46,602
Speaker 1: so it was a common because they're cheaper because they can't sell them to the grocers a common alcoholic beverage In Michigan.

130
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:57,019
Speaker 1: basically what you do is you take you make a hard apple cider Freeze it and you cut the middle out of the barrel because that's the alcohol and it was like this freeze distillation.

131
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,164
Speaker 1: So This is Apple Jack.

132
00:07:01,184 --> 00:07:02,870
Speaker 0: prefer the science lab distillation?

133
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,820
Speaker 1: yes, so this is the science lab version of Apple.

134
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,125
Speaker 0: Oh, not the freezing method.

135
00:07:07,206 --> 00:07:07,406
Speaker 1: No.

136
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:10,640
Speaker 0: This is a lot of people try to do the freezing method in their freezers.

137
00:07:11,285 --> 00:07:15,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, not doing that that is moonshine moonshine style.

138
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:18,709
Speaker 1: So yeah, I'm drinking my Apple Jack.

139
00:07:18,749 --> 00:07:19,211
Speaker 1: I'm digging it.

140
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:19,733
Speaker 0: Okay.

00:08:00,163 --> 00:08:02,632
Speaker 0: if somebody sent in a copyright complaint to Twitter.

156
00:08:02,652 --> 00:08:03,335
Speaker 0: We're just kind of crazy.

157
00:08:03,355 --> 00:08:03,857
Speaker 0: I'll get a hundred.

158
00:08:03,877 --> 00:08:10,412
Speaker 0: you could invalid You know bringing infringe a copyright 140 characters, but theoretically couldn't any retweet.

159
00:08:12,303 --> 00:08:13,177
Speaker 0: Don't even get into that.

160
00:08:13,843 --> 00:08:18,527
Speaker 0: We've talked about this but Twitter does receive DMC notices And they don't really want to have a legal team.

161
00:08:18,608 --> 00:08:21,560
Speaker 0: fight them like if I link to an illegal thing in a tweet.

162
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:25,560
Speaker 0: Someone might send a DMC thing to take my tweet down even though my tweets just a link.

163
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,135
Speaker 0: But Twitter is not gonna fight that for you.

164
00:08:27,155 --> 00:08:29,035
Speaker 0: right that is gonna Take you down because I don't give a shit.

165
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:29,962
Speaker 0: yep So.

166
00:08:30,062 --> 00:08:32,433
Speaker 0: but what they used to do is just delete your fucking tweet.

167
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,039
Speaker 0: because but the fuck right.

168
00:08:34,543 --> 00:08:37,159
Speaker 0: But now they are actually doing a good thing.

169
00:08:37,902 --> 00:08:51,716
Speaker 0: The good thing is let's say I tweet something and somehow I put I don't know in that 140 characters I fit all of Star Wars And Disney sends a DMCA notice like hey Scott's tweet has fucking all of Star Wars in it.

170
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:52,920
Speaker 0: what the fuck right.

171
00:08:52,940 --> 00:09:01,059
Speaker 1: wait So if I tweeted the entire script of Star Wars 144 characters at a time Would they send individual notices for each one of them?

172
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,643
Speaker 1: I don't know.

173
00:09:01,925 --> 00:09:03,897
Speaker 1: and how many of them would they have to remove before?

174
00:09:03,957 --> 00:09:05,380
Speaker 1: I would say well I'm no longer infringing.

175
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:11,563
Speaker 0: I'm sure Twitter must have some policy about the close your account after so many but anyway what they are doing now is they're not Gonna delete your tweet.

176
00:09:11,603 --> 00:09:15,879
Speaker 0: instead they put a special thing on your tweet, so of course no one can see it.

177
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:19,053
Speaker 0: But you you can still see your tweet that it's there.

178
00:09:19,173 --> 00:09:19,997
Speaker 0: You know you made it.

179
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:20,700
Speaker 0: You won't hallucinate.

180
00:09:20,902 --> 00:09:23,200
Speaker 1: What do they do about retweets of the tree tweet prior?

181
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,260
Speaker 0: I'm sure it does the same thing, but what if it's the old style RT retweets?

182
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:27,805
Speaker 1: I don't know.

183
00:09:28,028 --> 00:09:41,540
Speaker 0: or a quote anyway I don't know, but what they also do is they put a notice there for you to see like hey Yo, dog this tweet was taken down because blah blah blah and weren't they doing something like that for like tweets?

184
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:47,919
Speaker 0: Notice that was sent to Twitter to tell them to take it down is posted on chilling effects where you can go.

185
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:50,647
Speaker 0: check it Out nice, so this is like.

186
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:51,950
Speaker 0: Oh wait auto posted.

187
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:55,139
Speaker 1: What do you mean like automatically posted on chilling effects?

188
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:55,179
Speaker 0: I?

189
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,838
Speaker 0: See the copyright notices Twitter receives can be seen on the chilling effects website.

190
00:10:00,858 --> 00:10:07,905
Speaker 0: nice That is exactly how you should handle that so you can go and if you get a tweet that is taken down You can go.

191
00:10:07,985 --> 00:10:08,768
Speaker 0: see why.

192
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:13,860
Speaker 0: if you don't want your tweet taking down at all and you want to fight it Set up your own Twitter on your own computer.

193
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:18,573
Speaker 1: Remember when we decided Twitter was BS, and we ran a laconica server.

194
00:10:19,014 --> 00:10:21,763
Speaker 0: It is BS that it's not Federated.

195
00:10:21,843 --> 00:10:23,432
Speaker 0: yeah, yeah, it's.

196
00:10:23,452 --> 00:10:24,739
Speaker 0: there's not much you can do about things.

197
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,911
Speaker 1: We could use laconica and all of it's not that goodness.

198
00:10:28,032 --> 00:10:30,260
Speaker 0: No this something better will come along soon enough.

199
00:10:30,802 --> 00:10:32,468
Speaker 1: Well, I don't think it will soon enough.

200
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,696
Speaker 0: Federation has won every bad.

201
00:10:34,716 --> 00:10:35,358
Speaker 1: Yes, it has.

202
00:10:35,378 --> 00:10:39,034
Speaker 0: however It's only a matter of time before Federation wins this battle.

203
00:10:39,376 --> 00:10:40,160
Speaker 0: give it ten no one.

204
00:10:40,602 --> 00:10:43,074
Speaker 1: Yeah, ten years that is neither soon nor enough.

205
00:10:43,255 --> 00:10:44,119
Speaker 0: How is that not soon?

206
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:56,180
Speaker 1: It's soon on the scale of social change among old people among Technologists now that ten years from now is effectively like Mad Max far well here.

207
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,042
Speaker 0: Well, let's see about this.

208
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,068
Speaker 0: when did instant messaging exist?

209
00:10:59,268 --> 00:11:00,151
Speaker 0: when a wall came out?

210
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:00,271
Speaker 0: 97.

211
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:00,833
Speaker 0: I was using ICQ.

212
00:11:03,686 --> 00:11:06,467
Speaker 0: Okay Neither one of those is federated right.

213
00:11:06,487 --> 00:11:07,752
Speaker 0: so let's give it 97 right.

214
00:11:07,752 --> 00:11:12,050
Speaker 0: 95 97 Right somewhere in there mid 90s.

215
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:14,380
Speaker 0: When did G chat win?

216
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,348
Speaker 1: It's hard to say because I kind of stopped using.

217
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:18,694
Speaker 1: I am as AOL died.

218
00:11:18,775 --> 00:11:19,679
Speaker 0: you mean you used each head.

219
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:28,666
Speaker 1: now I used each head But it doesn't actually serve the same purpose because the vast majority of people I know are never logged into it And I can't chat with them.

220
00:11:28,907 --> 00:11:30,132
Speaker 0: I'm just saying when did it win?

221
00:11:30,172 --> 00:11:30,875
Speaker 0: it didn't win.

222
00:11:30,935 --> 00:11:31,799
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

223
00:11:31,819 --> 00:11:37,039
Speaker 1: did AOL and ICQ in my life were replaced with fucking nothing.

224
00:11:38,482 --> 00:11:41,320
Speaker 0: G chat won I'd say when I used name Scott.

225
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:44,854
Speaker 1: I had like 300 people on my list and I knew all of them who would talk to them.

226
00:11:45,135 --> 00:11:55,679
Speaker 1: right now there are 14 people online in my list and another like 20 that are not online And you know what the majority of them are g-plus contacts who don't ever respond if I message them.

227
00:11:56,462 --> 00:12:00,216
Speaker 0: Pretty sure Google Chat won sometimes shortly after you're out of college.

228
00:12:00,497 --> 00:12:04,779
Speaker 0: You didn't win 06 so it took about 10 years like to not win.

229
00:12:05,802 --> 00:12:06,424
Speaker 1: It didn't win.

230
00:12:06,444 --> 00:12:06,866
Speaker 0: it won.

231
00:12:06,986 --> 00:12:09,395
Speaker 1: It didn't replay didn't do what it did before.

232
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:10,640
Speaker 0: it does what it did before.

233
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,811
Speaker 0: Well, just not just cuz you're not using it the same way.

234
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:14,700
Speaker 1: You know, I am using it the same way.

235
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,752
Speaker 1: The problem is everyone else I know and knew is not.

236
00:12:17,772 --> 00:12:19,720
Speaker 0: that's not my problem.

237
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:22,807
Speaker 0: It's still the other instant messaging.

238
00:12:22,847 --> 00:12:23,690
Speaker 0: things have faded.

239
00:12:24,212 --> 00:12:25,416
Speaker 0: the G chat has elevated.

240
00:12:25,436 --> 00:12:41,764
Speaker 1: that is all that is therefore So the the previous world order disappeared and a very very pale simulacrum of that world order Instead of your craziness so long time ago as in October.

241
00:12:41,885 --> 00:12:43,430
Speaker 1: no, no, no, I'm gonna go even older.

242
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,815
Speaker 0: even remember.

243
00:12:44,876 --> 00:12:47,385
Speaker 0: remember the October September 22nd.

244
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:51,172
Speaker 1: There was news posted and people were talking about.

245
00:12:51,473 --> 00:12:57,366
Speaker 1: now the headlines were Ermagerd Ubuntu has Amazon ads Pre-installed.

246
00:12:57,386 --> 00:12:59,255
Speaker 0: let me just cheat you this link.

247
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:02,523
Speaker 1: Yeah Chat I can.

248
00:13:03,045 --> 00:13:03,827
Speaker 1: I can listen.

249
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,712
Speaker 0: you continue with your news here.

250
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:06,936
Speaker 0: Stop diverting.

251
00:13:07,176 --> 00:13:08,360
Speaker 1: I'm just saying no one else does.

252
00:13:09,047 --> 00:13:11,325
Speaker 0: You're diverting Just repeating the same thing.

253
00:13:11,465 --> 00:13:15,780
Speaker 0: if I message everyone who's not gonna make that the whole show repeating the same thing over and over again?

254
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,586
Speaker 0: That could be a show.

255
00:13:16,627 --> 00:13:17,514
Speaker 0: go back to your news.

256
00:13:17,736 --> 00:13:22,054
Speaker 1: Okay, so Ermagerd Ubuntu is gonna have Amazon ads in it.

257
00:13:22,095 --> 00:13:22,939
Speaker 1: now, of course true.

258
00:13:23,381 --> 00:13:27,658
Speaker 1: Yes, the majority of people who saw that at first were like no that is clearly some sort of hyperbolic.

259
00:13:27,698 --> 00:13:28,160
Speaker 1: No, it's true.

260
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,566
Speaker 1: It's true straight up true.

261
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:42,154
Speaker 1: So the deal is if you use Ubuntu Ubuntu 1210 or newer And you use that little - search feel like in Windows and I start like right now.

262
00:13:42,214 --> 00:13:45,983
Speaker 1: I start typing like I don't know putty Up there.

263
00:13:46,003 --> 00:13:47,768
Speaker 1: it is a found putty on my file system.

264
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:48,049
Speaker 0: Yep.

265
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,054
Speaker 1: So now I'm going to determine.

266
00:13:50,114 --> 00:13:54,088
Speaker 1: Yeah if I do that equivalently It'll find putty.

267
00:13:54,108 --> 00:13:55,720
Speaker 1: I guess I don't need putty in Ubuntu.

268
00:13:55,881 --> 00:13:58,611
Speaker 0: It'll also give you a link to buy silly putty on Amazon.

269
00:13:58,731 --> 00:14:01,180
Speaker 0: And if you buy silly putty Amazon gets affiliate dollars.

270
00:14:02,102 --> 00:14:02,290
Speaker 1: Yeah.

271
00:14:03,505 --> 00:14:09,188
Speaker 0: So it's like if you type in terminal I tried this you get you know The link to click on to open your terminal.

272
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:12,460
Speaker 1: you also get this like terminal you can buy for a dollar.

273
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,075
Speaker 0: Well, you also get like terminal 5 the band by their album.

274
00:14:16,678 --> 00:14:18,905
Speaker 1: So one This is stupid.

275
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:22,818
Speaker 1: Yeah - it's useless to anyone smart.

276
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:23,380
Speaker 1: three.

277
00:14:24,242 --> 00:14:39,977
Speaker 1: It's only gonna piss off nerds who are a full half of Ubuntu's user base a full 90% now because I think the other half is grandmas and parents and Cheap people who for whom the neighborhood kid or grandson gave them a computer with Ubuntu on it.

278
00:14:40,358 --> 00:14:42,748
Speaker 0: that happens But I believe it is rarer than I

279
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:54,526
Speaker 1: think that happens more than you think because the nerds By and large seem to be doubling down in the other direction and are using like scientific Linux or other craziness And outside like in no one's

280
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:55,189
Speaker 0: using that

281
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,232
Speaker 1: in companies.

282
00:14:56,634 --> 00:14:59,844
Speaker 1: Most people use CentOS or Suzy still.

283
00:14:59,864 --> 00:15:00,726
Speaker 0: yeah, it's true.

284
00:15:00,926 --> 00:15:03,293
Speaker 0: It's in the you know, the bigger company.

285
00:15:03,393 --> 00:15:04,055
Speaker 1: as an aside.

286
00:15:04,396 --> 00:15:07,222
Speaker 1: I recently installed Ubuntu Ubuntu.

287
00:15:07,262 --> 00:15:14,546
Speaker 1: yeah, so just cuz I needed a Linux box to you know, do real computing on And I had previously used CentOS.

288
00:15:15,008 --> 00:15:20,648
Speaker 1: Oh my god - sent OS suck fucking ass for anything desktop Yep, or server.

289
00:15:20,668 --> 00:15:22,680
Speaker 1: Yep, but it would use not good as server either.

290
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,698
Speaker 0: So the server but is not too bad depends on what you need to run if they have the package.

291
00:15:26,758 --> 00:15:28,605
Speaker 1: for yeah You want to use Tomcat anything?

292
00:15:29,107 --> 00:15:30,070
Speaker 0: No, you don't do that.

293
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,655
Speaker 0: No bad choice granted.

294
00:15:31,695 --> 00:15:37,880
Speaker 0: It's hard to use Tomcat in any Linux But the Ubuntu one the default Tomcat if you have to get it is all weird.

295
00:15:38,221 --> 00:15:39,708
Speaker 1: But anyway, this was the thing.

296
00:15:39,748 --> 00:15:42,360
Speaker 1: and of course there was the major crazy outrage.

297
00:15:42,862 --> 00:15:45,414
Speaker 1: So there's the follow-up story of shuttleworth saying trust us.

298
00:15:45,434 --> 00:15:46,640
Speaker 1: We're trying to make shopping better.

299
00:15:47,862 --> 00:15:48,384
Speaker 1: No, you're not.

300
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:49,429
Speaker 1: No, you're not.

301
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:56,711
Speaker 1: No, what you're trying to do is siphon Affiliate dollars from people who are dumb enough to go.

302
00:15:57,113 --> 00:16:03,500
Speaker 0: Oh, I guess I do need silly putty Mostly nerds who are going to use that default desktop, right?

303
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,121
Speaker 0: It's.

304
00:16:04,141 --> 00:16:08,908
Speaker 0: but just doing anything it can to try to find a way to make money When the only product they have is a free.

305
00:16:08,948 --> 00:16:11,057
Speaker 1: now pretty reason I bring all this up is one.

306
00:16:11,117 --> 00:16:26,395
Speaker 1: the newest story There's the trifecta here is that the EFF has basically come out and said hey Ubuntu stop this bullshit make that disabled by default because independent of my Ideological complaints and my I don't want to see ads ever complaints.

307
00:16:26,515 --> 00:16:27,980
Speaker 1: I mean, there's a reason I use adblock.

308
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, the operating system is sacred ground.

309
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:32,276
Speaker 1: You don't fuck with that.

310
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:42,320
Speaker 1: And while you're gonna say That is not the operating system for the majority of people that is the operating system as far as they're concerned.

311
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:53,000
Speaker 0: Yes, but not by the technical definition of the term operating system Yes, but by the definition of software that is installed on your computer before you have chosen to install additional software.

312
00:16:53,301 --> 00:17:00,027
Speaker 1: Yes, so you the GNU Linux beard is in fact a hundred percent technically correct and useless For a normal person.

313
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:02,377
Speaker 1: if they install they put the Ubuntu CD in.

314
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:04,184
Speaker 1: when they're done They've got that's Ubuntu.

315
00:17:04,385 --> 00:17:08,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever they see when they log in even the applications that aren't Ubuntu like Firefox.

316
00:17:08,801 --> 00:17:09,789
Speaker 1: so people have been afraid.

317
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:17,060
Speaker 1: nerds have been afraid forever of Microsoft or Larry Ellison and all his bullshit putting ads in the operating system.

318
00:17:18,026 --> 00:17:24,980
Speaker 1: I know what you're trying to do Ubuntu But all you're doing is going up to a bunch of angry nerds and poking them with a sharp stick.

319
00:17:26,763 --> 00:17:29,321
Speaker 1: I don't have anything else to say about it Other than that.

320
00:17:29,342 --> 00:17:31,628
Speaker 1: the EFS concerns have nothing to do with that.

321
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:37,949
Speaker 1: Their concern is simply yeah, so you're sending Amazon Information and then getting back results.

322
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,134
Speaker 0: You're sending Amazon.

323
00:17:39,254 --> 00:17:43,464
Speaker 0: everything everyone types into Their.

324
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:53,079
Speaker 1: so when the guy's typing like my little pony fanfiction because he's trying to find his folder of fanfiction Amazon's gonna see that and recommend things.

325
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,433
Speaker 1: now Gmail does that too, but at least it's.

326
00:17:57,573 --> 00:18:02,778
Speaker 1: you're not typing my little pony fan You're not searching you're not using Gmail to search your own computer.

327
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:16,200
Speaker 1: Yep so this is bad all around and it is possible to turn it off, but Even if it is it really reduces the trust of Ubuntu as a Linux distribution.

328
00:18:16,401 --> 00:18:18,107
Speaker 0: That's why this stuff like mint and shit.

329
00:18:18,408 --> 00:18:21,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, but in that desktop that you know, it's not really that good.

330
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:22,279
Speaker 1: I don't like it at all.

331
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:32,223
Speaker 1: But Windows 8 the metro that's not called metro anymore is just as bad in every account except for the fact that doesn't show me Ads, but that's a separate discussion Really?

332
00:18:32,283 --> 00:18:39,979
Speaker 0: I know a lot of people who upgrade to Windows 8 because it is better in some under-the-hood ways And it is disable the metro and just go straight to the regular.

333
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:43,160
Speaker 1: now My fear is not that metro sucks because I can get around it.

334
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,550
Speaker 1: My fear is that the desktop side of it will be deprecated.

335
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:54,639
Speaker 1: Mmm and a UEFI and all that other stuff, but The reason I bring up this whole thing with Ubuntu is because it wound to what it says.

336
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:55,901
Speaker 1: Really?

337
00:18:56,482 --> 00:19:03,140
Speaker 1: Is that desktop Linux is in fact dead and they need money or it will die?

338
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,768
Speaker 0: Well is the thing I actually they do need money.

339
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:09,320
Speaker 0: at least Ubuntu needs money, but what other desktop Linux is there?

340
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,366
Speaker 0: Well, I think what I think what could happen?

341
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:16,000
Speaker 1: we had the HTPC movement with boxy, but boxy went a little bastard.

342
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,431
Speaker 0: Here's here's what I can see in the future.

343
00:19:18,451 --> 00:19:20,500
Speaker 0: Notice boxy didn't do too well with this.

344
00:19:21,762 --> 00:19:23,156
Speaker 0: Here's what I see in the future, right?

345
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:28,740
Speaker 0: Normal peoples who only use their computers for normal type things.

346
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,490
Speaker 0: Right They don't really aren't gonna need a laptop desktop.

347
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,057
Speaker 0: They're gonna get by with a tablet phone.

348
00:19:36,097 --> 00:19:41,739
Speaker 0: Maybe some you know similar Apple TV kind of device in the TV something something right.

349
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:48,000
Speaker 0: and The only thing desktops will be used for is people who need to do work and people want to play games.

350
00:19:48,201 --> 00:19:49,108
Speaker 0: And that's pretty much it.

351
00:19:49,693 --> 00:19:50,378
Speaker 0: and they're not gonna be.

352
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:56,140
Speaker 1: you know No, when you say games you mean PC games the traditional sense not Angry Birds serious games, right?

353
00:19:57,222 --> 00:20:01,180
Speaker 0: So that's the only reason people are gonna have desktops to do work and play games.

354
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:06,414
Speaker 1: So I'm here to do work and play games and in that all out of operating.

355
00:20:06,475 --> 00:20:08,420
Speaker 0: and in that sense, right?

356
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,247
Speaker 0: I think Windows was gonna.

357
00:20:10,267 --> 00:20:13,479
Speaker 0: you know, it's just the library of games for Windows is so big.

358
00:20:14,202 --> 00:20:17,637
Speaker 0: it's gonna take a long time to make Windows not needed for games,

359
00:20:17,858 --> 00:20:18,179
Speaker 1: but I

360
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:42,460
Speaker 0: Could see the newer versions of Windows being bad and the steam Linux coming on so strong such that You know in some number of years, maybe ten years, whatever the other thing I talked about will happen when Twitter's federated You will have you know, the games will come out for Linux because that's the only you know.

361
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,130
Speaker 0: Modern operating you couldn't you?

362
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:47,587
Speaker 0: there'll be a point at which you know Windows 7 can read you only.

363
00:20:47,607 --> 00:20:52,949
Speaker 0: you need to keep a Windows 7 around to run the vast library of old games But it won't be an operating system.

364
00:20:52,969 --> 00:20:55,140
Speaker 0: You can actually use for computing daily.

365
00:20:55,482 --> 00:20:57,993
Speaker 0: So you'll need to use Linux for that or OS X those be.

366
00:20:58,074 --> 00:21:01,495
Speaker 0: if OS X is even still around It could be all iOS by then.

367
00:21:01,515 --> 00:21:01,878
Speaker 0: You don't know.

368
00:21:02,602 --> 00:21:07,057
Speaker 0: so you're gonna run Linux and new games and your everyday computing.

369
00:21:07,097 --> 00:21:10,753
Speaker 0: Linux II and Windows will be around for your old games the same way.

370
00:21:10,773 --> 00:21:12,180
Speaker 0: Some people's love DOS for old games.

371
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,922
Speaker 1: Well, we'll see there's.

372
00:21:12,963 --> 00:21:17,197
Speaker 0: there's another factor that are but most people won't even have a desktop.

373
00:21:17,237 --> 00:21:28,367
Speaker 1: our good friend Conrad Did link to an article recently that was actually very interesting the one that talked about how it argued that the shittier a person is Using computers the more powerful machine They actually need the.

374
00:21:28,427 --> 00:21:38,260
Speaker 1: the gist of it was that someone like me or Scott or some of you who are listening If I have a shitty ask him like a 486, I understand its limitations and I can deal with all of its limitations.

375
00:21:38,461 --> 00:21:39,345
Speaker 1: I know what I'm doing.

376
00:21:39,706 --> 00:21:46,931
Speaker 1: So some some crappy little netbook or like my laptop my new laptop It only has like 120 gigabytes of space total.

377
00:21:46,951 --> 00:21:50,080
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, and that's fine for what I'm doing.

378
00:21:50,461 --> 00:21:54,956
Speaker 1: But if you gave that laptop just some random schmo using the computer that's usually those people.

379
00:21:54,996 --> 00:21:56,120
Speaker 0: they only have one computer.

380
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,325
Speaker 0: That's their computer period.

381
00:21:57,345 --> 00:21:57,968
Speaker 0: they don't have most.

382
00:21:58,008 --> 00:21:58,952
Speaker 1: fill it up immediately.

383
00:21:58,992 --> 00:22:08,069
Speaker 0: with his iTunes collection and his torrents He doesn't know about things being stored in spaces or which hard drives filling up or right and his CPU He'd probably install.

384
00:22:08,089 --> 00:22:13,560
Speaker 0: Kansas spywares Need a bigger CPU and more RAM to make the computer not be useless after he's fucked it up.

385
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,020
Speaker 1: So this tablet revolution I think is going to come back real in the next years.

386
00:22:19,482 --> 00:22:27,332
Speaker 1: The lockdown OS prevents them from fucking the shit up but at the same time Such they'll be locked into a hardware upgrade cycle.

387
00:22:27,392 --> 00:22:29,239
Speaker 1: That is more rapid than they were before.

388
00:22:29,561 --> 00:22:35,525
Speaker 1: They're gonna have a weak laptop or a weak tablet a year later one That's twice as fast comes out.

389
00:22:35,867 --> 00:22:37,432
Speaker 1: and because their old one is slow.

390
00:22:37,453 --> 00:22:42,620
Speaker 1: I mean even Android might my phone Slightly sluggish if I use some of the advanced stuff.

391
00:22:42,724 --> 00:22:48,540
Speaker 0: Yeah I needed to upgrade my iPhone 4 which is still otherwise Unserviceable to iPhone 5 so that I could play Super Hexagon.

392
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:53,660
Speaker 1: So there's a lot of concerns around this but the moral is that desktop Linux is having some trouble.

393
00:22:53,881 --> 00:22:55,208
Speaker 0: Well, when is it not had trouble?

394
00:22:55,308 --> 00:22:56,233
Speaker 0: more so than ever.

395
00:22:56,273 --> 00:23:03,800
Speaker 0: but I think it's looking promising Even though Ubuntu is doing stupid shit into simply because everyone else is just abandoning even fighting them.

396
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,333
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, they just sort of Linux just sort of hang in there.

397
00:23:07,634 --> 00:23:09,140
Speaker 0: Yeah kept being the loser.

398
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:12,371
Speaker 0: It'd be like if every team quit the NFL except the Cleveland Browns.

399
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,153
Speaker 0: They'd be like Super Bowl.

400
00:23:13,214 --> 00:23:13,494
Speaker 1: Yes.

401
00:23:13,595 --> 00:23:13,996
Speaker 1: Yes.

402
00:23:14,237 --> 00:23:14,919
Speaker 0: That's what it's like.

403
00:23:21,271 --> 00:23:29,570
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day We talked about on an episode we recorded that has not aired yet about pre-hoc and post-hoc trash talk.

404
00:23:30,152 --> 00:23:32,178
Speaker 1: So I am now right now 645 p.m.

405
00:23:32,218 --> 00:23:33,262
Speaker 1: Dateline Guy Fawkes day.

406
00:23:33,523 --> 00:23:38,044
Speaker 1: I am going to pre-hoc trash talk.

407
00:23:38,769 --> 00:23:40,997
Speaker 1: the 2012 presidential election.

408
00:23:41,037 --> 00:23:56,879
Speaker 1: my thing of the day is a video from last year When Obama won or last year last election four years ago when Obama won and it is get your war On which is a they do kind of good funny Rotoscoped animations about politics.

409
00:23:57,421 --> 00:24:02,430
Speaker 1: It's kind of like a webcomic but in YouTube form and They have one of the funniest videos ever.

410
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:06,730
Speaker 1: This is the kind of thing that tomorrow when Obama wins the election one of the funniest videos ever.

411
00:24:06,911 --> 00:24:07,754
Speaker 1: No, but tomorrow.

412
00:24:07,855 --> 00:24:09,120
Speaker 1: this is funny in one context.

413
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:18,550
Speaker 1: tomorrow when Obama wins the election You mail this a link to this to your scary conservative aunt or Scott Johnson's dad.

414
00:24:19,972 --> 00:24:24,049
Speaker 1: That is what you do, okay, it's pretty funny - mostly the whole - cheeky thing.

415
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:27,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, so everybody knows whatever scares you the most.

416
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,565
Speaker 0: it's football time and everybody knows it.

417
00:24:29,606 --> 00:24:31,150
Speaker 0: nerds even nerds.

418
00:24:31,331 --> 00:24:32,173
Speaker 0: You don't like football.

419
00:24:32,715 --> 00:24:45,290
Speaker 0: no Tecmo Bowl and Tecmo Bowl is in fact in my opinion the most fun Football related video game ever made especially Tecmo Super Bowl, right and the also not so often noticed super Tecmo Bowl.

420
00:24:45,892 --> 00:24:52,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Super Nintendo, but anyway Tecmo Super Bowl everybody knows that there's some guys out there Who are so into Tecmo Super Bowl that every year?

421
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:55,849
Speaker 0: They update the rosters of all the teams and they have all these ROM hacks.

422
00:24:56,332 --> 00:24:59,365
Speaker 0: So you can play updated Tecmo Super Bowl all the time.

423
00:24:59,646 --> 00:25:00,269
Speaker 0: It's pretty great.

424
00:25:01,372 --> 00:25:03,884
Speaker 0: So the website for that is actually Tecmo Bowl org.

425
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:04,769
Speaker 0: I just learned that.

426
00:25:05,675 --> 00:25:20,530
Speaker 0: but more importantly my thing of the day is that NFL Films, you know the pretty much the reason the NFL is popular made a Documentary about Tecmo Super Bowl that already aired on ESPN 2 and the NFL Network a bunch of times.

427
00:25:20,911 --> 00:25:25,302
Speaker 0: But I'm sure if you wanted to you could find it somewhere to watch it.

428
00:25:25,322 --> 00:25:27,648
Speaker 0: So I'm linking to Tecmo Bowl org.

429
00:25:29,332 --> 00:25:32,649
Speaker 0: Actually, I'll link to the post about this documentary on Tecmo Bowl org.

430
00:25:33,251 --> 00:25:47,607
Speaker 0: But yeah, you should go and watch this documentary because they interview all the guys, you know, who are always You know hacking the game and playing in Tecmo Bowl tournaments and all that kind of stuff and It is pretty cool.

431
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:51,600
Speaker 1: So in the meta moment, we're gonna be at magfest.

432
00:25:51,881 --> 00:25:52,524
Speaker 1: fucking shit up.

433
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:54,190
Speaker 0: That is a long-ass time for now.

434
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:55,422
Speaker 1: Oh, it's November.

435
00:25:55,442 --> 00:25:59,361
Speaker 1: So Two months from now not that far long time.

436
00:25:59,582 --> 00:26:00,606
Speaker 1: We're gonna be at PAX East.

437
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:01,710
Speaker 1: We're gonna be at PAX Australia.

438
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:07,617
Speaker 1: We're gonna be at Anime Boston and And Connecticut in July, that's right.

439
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:10,325
Speaker 1: Actually Connecticut is slightly before PAX Australia.

440
00:26:10,345 --> 00:26:14,943
Speaker 0: Okay, the book club book is still The name of the wind which now I know.

441
00:26:15,184 --> 00:26:16,270
Speaker 0: yes, you know the name of the way.

442
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:17,916
Speaker 1: It's like not to spoil.

443
00:26:17,936 --> 00:26:23,258
Speaker 1: but there's a point in the book where someone's like say this word I'm like, oh that's the name of the wind.

444
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:26,451
Speaker 1: and they're like, yes, that is the name of the wind that word right there Mm-hmm.

445
00:26:26,732 --> 00:26:27,676
Speaker 1: It was just there it is.

446
00:26:27,897 --> 00:26:28,438
Speaker 1: I can say it.

447
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yeah, the name of the wind is the book.

448
00:26:32,954 --> 00:26:35,130
Speaker 0: I guess rim finished it cuz he knows the name of the wind.

449
00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:37,761
Speaker 0: So we'll be talking about that relatively soon.

450
00:26:37,781 --> 00:26:41,675
Speaker 0: and then rim will pick something else probably awful Probably the Great Gatsby.

451
00:26:41,936 --> 00:26:44,204
Speaker 1: great because I want to read it before that movie comes out.

452
00:26:44,505 --> 00:26:45,889
Speaker 1: great supposedly a good book.

453
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,109
Speaker 1: Or I could pick the second book in the name of the wind.

454
00:26:51,212 --> 00:26:51,896
Speaker 0: I'm gonna read it.

455
00:26:52,097 --> 00:26:52,539
Speaker 0: I bought it.

456
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:57,123
Speaker 1: I have it sitting there cuz granted I got a tired of some of the Harry Potter crap that happened.

457
00:26:57,164 --> 00:27:04,273
Speaker 0: But otherwise You always like reviewing the book club book before the episode These goddamn books.

458
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:07,302
Speaker 0: I don't think any of that amount of tantalizing is gonna help.

459
00:27:07,783 --> 00:27:08,585
Speaker 1: It's a pretty good book.

460
00:27:08,946 --> 00:27:11,458
Speaker 0: Anyway, uh Any other met?

461
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:13,070
Speaker 0: Oh, I sent out the newsletter today.

462
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:17,190
Speaker 0: Yeah I think I fixed the problem where the text version is not screwed up.

463
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:21,490
Speaker 0: Apparently there's a button you have to click to update the text version after you edit the HTML version.

464
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:23,503
Speaker 0: Well, why do I have to click that button?

465
00:27:23,543 --> 00:27:23,805
Speaker 0: Seriously?

466
00:27:23,825 --> 00:27:24,529

Speaker 0: I still get four days 15 hours 9 minutes and 40 something seconds.

492
00:28:24,784 --> 00:28:25,766
Speaker 0: I was recording.

493
00:28:26,067 --> 00:28:39,210
Speaker 1: I get more Correspondence about fucking radio free equestria where we did like 13 episodes that I get about anything else I've ever done in my life except for Pony countdown just because.

494
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:42,585
Speaker 1: But yeah for all of you who bother me all the time about that.

495
00:28:42,645 --> 00:28:43,650
Speaker 1: Yes, we're doing it.

496
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:55,279
Speaker 1: We're starting a season of it in Four days and 15. well 15 hours plus the length of one episode plus however long it takes us to record an episode And put it online which is pretty quick.

497
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:55,439
Speaker 1: Now.

498
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:56,906
Speaker 1: I actually streamlined my process.

499
00:28:56,926 --> 00:29:02,649
Speaker 1: Okay, so Let's So hit relay chat.

500
00:29:03,353 --> 00:29:05,521
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're supposed to do an episode on this.

501
00:29:05,883 --> 00:29:10,082
Speaker 0: So I'll admit the idea we got so Way way back in the day.

502
00:29:10,103 --> 00:29:11,470
Speaker 1: I was really big.

503
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,939
Speaker 1: I gotta get away from this pony countdown because I'm just staring at it.

504
00:29:13,959 --> 00:29:14,601
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

505
00:29:15,063 --> 00:29:16,047
Speaker 1: It's a long time ago.

506
00:29:16,067 --> 00:29:20,878
Speaker 1: I Wanted to get on the internet And I didn't know how.

507
00:29:21,782 --> 00:29:24,694
Speaker 1: we had prodigy classic Mm-hmm there.

508
00:29:24,734 --> 00:29:28,789
Speaker 1: you couldn't get on the internet from there and I didn't know what the internet was.

509
00:29:29,832 --> 00:29:34,106
Speaker 1: So I remember trying to get went to the library and tried to find books on the internet and I start.

510
00:29:34,146 --> 00:29:43,401
Speaker 1: I vaguely learned about ISPs and ARPANET, but I couldn't quite figure it out and I'd log into like BBS's and chat with people and all this stuff.

511
00:29:44,144 --> 00:29:47,830
Speaker 1: I didn't ever actually use IRC Until I was in high school.

512
00:29:48,632 --> 00:29:50,298
Speaker 1: All right, I didn't use it that much.

513
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:56,779
Speaker 1: Okay, because I by the time I learned about IRC and started using it I already had ICQ which 100% replaced it for me.

514
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:03,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Used IRC more in RIT than I used it at any other place in my entire life.

515
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,655
Speaker 0: I keep using.

516
00:30:04,715 --> 00:30:07,430
Speaker 0: my use of IRC is increase decrease increase decrease.

517
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,381
Speaker 0: It goes up and down back and forth back and forth.

518
00:30:09,421 --> 00:30:21,105
Speaker 0: All right, but basically, you know back in the day I was much like you You know, I learned internetting Actually learned HTMLs before I had internets at my house at summer camp.

519
00:30:21,126 --> 00:30:22,370
Speaker 0: I learned the HTMLs at Netscape.

520
00:30:22,574 --> 00:30:23,390
Speaker 1: I was in the same boat.

521
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:28,030
Speaker 1: I was in middle school and a guy was like I learned how to program and I was like what right?

522
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:29,378
Speaker 0: So anyway, I went.

523
00:30:29,398 --> 00:30:33,459
Speaker 0: you know when I got AOL's at my house I wanted to use Netscape instead of this.

524
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:36,390
Speaker 0: I knew that this browser and AOL was no good, you know.

525
00:30:36,912 --> 00:30:40,590
Speaker 0: So I learned you could run nets you could minimize AOL and just open up Netscape.

526
00:30:40,771 --> 00:30:41,996
Speaker 1: See, I never used AOL.

527
00:30:42,056 --> 00:30:45,490
Speaker 1: So I went straight from Prodigy to oh my god fucking internet.

528
00:30:45,784 --> 00:30:47,224
Speaker 0: Yeah Then I had it fucking internet.

529
00:30:47,285 --> 00:30:52,650
Speaker 0: after that I just had to dial up into the local phone company up when I had my own computer upstairs.

530
00:30:52,871 --> 00:30:55,379
Speaker 0: But anyway, you know once I learned you could do that.

531
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:58,690
Speaker 0: I was like, hey, are there other programs that you can just run to?

532
00:30:58,890 --> 00:30:59,386
Speaker 0: Use the Internet.

533
00:31:01,315 --> 00:31:07,246
Speaker 0: So, of course, you know, I was using the chats inside of AOL But they were sort of very restricted by AOL.

534
00:31:08,611 --> 00:31:14,350
Speaker 0: So I discovered IRC and I was like, oh you get this M IRC program and look at all these chats about things.

535
00:31:14,592 --> 00:31:14,733
Speaker 0: Now

536
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:32,762
Speaker 1: even as late as when we were in high school it's interesting because IRC and Usenet were two there are things now that the only people who really know about them and use them to this day are really old people usually with beards or Young punk kids who are in the like darknet of like super piracy

537
00:31:32,923 --> 00:31:34,186
Speaker 0: or super tech people

538
00:31:34,427 --> 00:31:35,450
Speaker 1: or child pornographers.

539
00:31:35,751 --> 00:31:38,019
Speaker 0: Yeah, people in the who doing dark evil things.

540
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:38,400
Speaker 0: Yes.

541
00:31:38,902 --> 00:31:50,441
Speaker 1: So even as late as when we were in high school IRC and Usenet still worked the way they were intended to a large degree Yep, but then they were ruined by things we'll talk about.

542
00:31:50,481 --> 00:31:52,490
Speaker 0: Well IRC mostly works the way as its intended.

543
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:55,421
Speaker 0: Yeah, well the thing is bad news groups not as much.

544
00:31:55,502 --> 00:32:02,448
Speaker 0: but some news groups still do especially like the Academic ones that you know, people are still on like comp Lang something something.

545
00:32:02,468 --> 00:32:07,201
Speaker 0: this, you know If you're at a university that still has a news group server You can use that the old-school way you can.

546
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:12,221
Speaker 1: but the problem with IRC Just talk about IRC not get into the additional problems of BBS's.

547
00:32:12,261 --> 00:32:14,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Usenet was that let's do using this.

548
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:25,866
Speaker 1: Yeah So the way IRC works in the same way email does in that it was designed in an era when no one really Considered the possibilities of things like spam.

549
00:32:26,148 --> 00:32:29,462
Speaker 1: Yeah It was just all right, I'm gonna run an IRC server.

550
00:32:29,502 --> 00:32:31,651
Speaker 1: Hey Scott you run an IRC server - I'll tell you what Let's.

551
00:32:31,791 --> 00:32:33,237
Speaker 1: uh, let's join our server.

552
00:32:33,277 --> 00:32:36,770
Speaker 1: So all my channels show up on yours and vice versa and all our users can just chat.

553
00:32:37,352 --> 00:32:42,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean who wants to connect to a server so far away where there's gonna be this big-ass delay, right?

554
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:43,212
Speaker 0: Why would we?

555
00:32:43,533 --> 00:32:50,682
Speaker 0: you know that that's so annoying and if you want to chat with someone on one server and also chat with Someone on another server that kind of sucks is nice.

556
00:32:50,742 --> 00:32:52,770
Speaker 0: I suddenly have you're from your local computer.

557
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,461
Speaker 0: You have to connect to all these different servers.

558
00:32:54,521 --> 00:32:55,367
Speaker 0: that fucking sucks.

559
00:32:55,427 --> 00:33:01,330
Speaker 0: instead Everyone can connect to one server right the one closest to them and join any channel.

560
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,877
Speaker 0: They want to talk to anyone they want.

561
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:13,830
Speaker 0: and if there's anyone who you want to talk to someone who's on it You know connected to a different server the servers will talk to each other, you know And no one needs to make these, you know multiple connections in their house clogging up the whole internet.

562
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:14,878
Speaker 1: So there were big like.

563
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:16,330
Speaker 1: there were semi-private.

564
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:18,537
Speaker 1: IRC is like there were completely cordoned off.

565
00:33:18,678 --> 00:33:23,516
Speaker 1: IRC is like chunks of servers that would talk together and they have their own rules their Culture their own whatever.

566
00:33:23,978 --> 00:33:33,630
Speaker 1: but there are also a very large kind of Universal IRC networks the XM alternate server F net alternate down that there's basically big groups of IRC servers.

567
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,034
Speaker 0: They have servers all over the world.

568
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:39,005
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they all those servers are basically effectively the same server.

569
00:33:39,487 --> 00:33:42,815
Speaker 0: you connect to them and You see every channel.

570
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:47,290
Speaker 0: that's on every one of those servers with every user and you can join any channel and talk to anyone.

571
00:33:47,531 --> 00:33:48,173
Speaker 1: Now think about that.

572
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:58,370
Speaker 1: think of it how hard it is for example in the modern internet to ban One person from a network like that where all these servers are completely federated.

573
00:33:58,571 --> 00:34:00,077
Speaker 1: I'm running an IRC server.

574
00:34:00,378 --> 00:34:02,225
Speaker 1: if the network trusts me it trusts me.

575
00:34:02,245 --> 00:34:06,230
Speaker 0: Yep You have to send that ban to every single server.

576
00:34:06,331 --> 00:34:07,803
Speaker 0: So they all know that you're banned.

577
00:34:07,883 --> 00:34:08,690
Speaker 1: and even then what do you ban?

578
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,637
Speaker 1: You can just change your nickname all the time.

579
00:34:10,657 --> 00:34:12,603
Speaker 1: You gotta ban some fucking IPs.

580
00:34:12,744 --> 00:34:15,318
Speaker 0: I change which IP I'm coming from Cuz I use a VPN.

581
00:34:15,438 --> 00:34:16,969
Speaker 1: now I get a ban entire net mask.

582
00:34:17,331 --> 00:34:18,637
Speaker 0: But now I'm using a VPN.

583
00:34:18,658 --> 00:34:21,170
Speaker 0: the tons of other people are using cuz it's like some.

584
00:34:21,853 --> 00:34:23,081
Speaker 0: It's you know, it's one of those tour things.

585
00:34:23,101 --> 00:34:24,168
Speaker 0: You can't ban it the whole thing.

586
00:34:24,248 --> 00:34:25,875
Speaker 1: Yep Well, you can maybe in some.

587
00:34:25,935 --> 00:34:27,320
Speaker 1: so now look at this problem.

588
00:34:27,621 --> 00:34:33,103
Speaker 1: to have a relatively usable IRC network Maybe you just fucking ban all those services.

589
00:34:33,143 --> 00:34:37,938
Speaker 0: never very restrictive No, instead what people do is they just let IRC go nuts.

590
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,409
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is IRC was always this kind of Wild West place.

591
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:50,118
Speaker 1: I mean the when I was hanging out in IRC when I would idle in high school, which basically IRC is the Idle relay protocol.

592
00:34:50,138 --> 00:34:50,880
Speaker 1: Well, it's so weird.

593
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:56,040
Speaker 0: right back in those days those 90s and you chatted You turned your computer on you dialed in first of all.

594
00:34:56,141 --> 00:34:58,750
Speaker 0: Yep, you would open the chat and you would be looking at it.

595
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:03,384
Speaker 0: That's all you would be doing is looking at the chat and chatting Occasionally, I'd be especially leaves.

596
00:35:03,424 --> 00:35:06,690
Speaker 1: at the same time I'd be like chatting with my magic friends in the magic room.

597
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,185
Speaker 0: Maybe such a limit you a lot of role-playing chats would happen.

598
00:35:09,205 --> 00:35:10,090
Speaker 0: I guess those still happen.

599
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:12,158
Speaker 1: I did a lot of that a lot of Forgotten Realms rope.

600
00:35:12,218 --> 00:35:14,165
Speaker 1: I'm sorry for God hidden items.

601
00:35:14,246 --> 00:35:14,988
Speaker 1: Correct.

602
00:35:15,008 --> 00:35:18,097
Speaker 0: That's correct Okay, but nowadays people don't do that, right?

603
00:35:18,578 --> 00:35:20,082
Speaker 0: But what do people do?

604
00:35:20,143 --> 00:35:25,439
Speaker 0: Well, in fact, you know, I've said this before nowadays We're talking 10 years ago - yeah, alrighty.

605
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:33,203
Speaker 0: Well, but I'm saying is that nowadays people Sort of Twitter in my eyes has replaced the need of IRC, right?

606
00:35:33,303 --> 00:35:35,470
Speaker 0: It's you don't have to pay attention to all the time.

607
00:35:35,711 --> 00:35:40,130
Speaker 0: It's basically Twitter is one big chat room and the whole world is in the chat room.

608
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:47,150
Speaker 1: Well, but I'm really in a chat room that consists of the list of all the people on subscribe But by default everyone is on mute.

609
00:35:47,351 --> 00:35:54,429
Speaker 0: So you basically join this chat room with everyone in the world in it and they're all on mute and then you unmute Individual people and that's Twitter, right?

610
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:56,516
Speaker 0: So what IRC is?

611
00:35:56,697 --> 00:35:57,100
Speaker 0: basically?

612
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,850
Speaker 0: everyone is not on mute by default.

613
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:02,470
Speaker 0: But you go into a channel that doesn't have everyone in the world, you know, you go through the channel.

614
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:14,070
Speaker 0: There's a few people who care about the same thing you care about And that, you know, but usually what happens is, you know, you go to a channel But the people in that channel, they're in there, but they're not at the computer right now.

615
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:16,441
Speaker 0: They're doing something else like browsing the web or playing a game.

616
00:36:16,462 --> 00:36:18,170
Speaker 0: They just want to hang out in the channel.

617
00:36:18,594 --> 00:36:20,330
Speaker 0: So everyone's hanging out, but not saying anything.

618
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:23,370
Speaker 0: But then if you need to say something you go in there and say it and there's no response.

619
00:36:24,411 --> 00:36:26,401
Speaker 0: But then later someone might come and look and notice.

620
00:36:26,762 --> 00:36:28,330
Speaker 0: Oh, someone said something and then respond.

621
00:36:28,713 --> 00:36:29,299
Speaker 1: You got to idle.

622
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,449
Speaker 1: You got to just hang out in the room.

623
00:36:30,651 --> 00:36:33,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you don't hang out in there, you might miss when someone says something, right?

624
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:38,290
Speaker 0: So now the way people use IRC is so messed up is now it's interesting.

625
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:38,853
Speaker 1: You know talk about.

626
00:36:39,014 --> 00:36:39,798
Speaker 1: I like old.

627
00:36:39,879 --> 00:36:43,397
Speaker 1: I am the reason I hated AOL so much was that ICQ did a lot of that stuff.

628
00:36:43,417 --> 00:36:46,350
Speaker 1: like ICQ I could send messages to people who weren't online.

629
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:52,410
Speaker 1: No I could start a chat room that people will come and go and I actually once ICQ really caught on I use that.

630
00:36:52,932 --> 00:36:57,970
Speaker 1: For I've spawned chat rooms and have 20 people in them all the time and I basically stopped using IRC.

631
00:36:59,132 --> 00:37:08,287
Speaker 0: Yeah, so but I see had other features You know that are Like like wars of like trying to flood someone out of a channel or bots and things crazy.

632
00:37:08,387 --> 00:37:09,290
Speaker 1: net split bullshit.

633
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:12,486
Speaker 1: We're suddenly the channel like splits in two because the network had a problem.

634
00:37:12,687 --> 00:37:13,290
Speaker 0: Yeah that yeah.

635
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:14,597
Speaker 0: Well, so a net split right.

636
00:37:14,638 --> 00:37:16,026
Speaker 0: we said an IRC is when there's.

637
00:37:16,429 --> 00:37:18,329
Speaker 0: you know You have all these servers that are all part of the same net.

638
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:23,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, say I'm connected to my own IRC server that I run connected to alternate and my servers trusted alternate.

639
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:25,330
Speaker 1: So we're chatting with each other.

640
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:26,335
Speaker 1: There's much people in the room.

641
00:37:26,998 --> 00:37:29,710
Speaker 1: say my server loses its upstream connection to alternate.

642
00:37:30,171 --> 00:37:42,250
Speaker 1: Well, suddenly I'm still in my room with all the people who are connected to my server and all the servers connected to me in The tree up to the point where I lost the connection and Scott's connected to alternate with all those people.

643
00:37:42,634 --> 00:37:47,723
Speaker 1: So we're both in the same room but we see a different list of people and we see we're talking you.

644
00:37:47,764 --> 00:37:53,746
Speaker 0: they can't see what I'm saying and he can't see what He's saying because we're separated and then eventually when the internet comes back We'll be reconnected.

645
00:37:53,807 --> 00:38:02,510
Speaker 1: now Woe betide when like the the op in the room gets split away and then like someone else Abuses op to fuck up the room and then the rooms recombine.

646
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:17,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, I are see, you know, unlike other chats has this sort of inherent structure of you know controlling the room being the operator You know who can ban people and kick people and set the title and yeah all the and gets all these privileges and setting who?

647
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:25,034
Speaker 1: Has which caused a weird sort of social structure where like the people who had that little plus next to the name were just they Were the nobility they were better people.

648
00:38:25,074 --> 00:38:37,956
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's the you know, the the technology of how the rooms are managed, you know sort of you know Created this social structure around it that matched, you know It wasn't the other way around.

649
00:38:37,996 --> 00:38:46,250
Speaker 0: like we come up with the social structure we want and then we make the technology fit that They just sort of made this technology chance serve listserv stuff to manage.

650
00:38:46,692 --> 00:38:57,650
Speaker 0: you know who's in what rooms who controls the rooms and channels and From that came how you have to manage an IRC which is annoying because you really have no other choice.

651
00:38:57,771 --> 00:38:58,293
Speaker 0: It's not like.

652
00:38:58,655 --> 00:39:01,850
Speaker 0: if you don't like the way PHP BB does it you can switch and use vanilla.

653
00:39:02,031 --> 00:39:02,933
Speaker 0: It's like this IRC.

654
00:39:02,953 --> 00:39:08,250
Speaker 0: in this IRC, you know, you can't switch to some other non IRC thing that does it differently.

655
00:39:10,211 --> 00:39:12,018
Speaker 0: But yeah, I mean you could I guess come up with.

656
00:39:12,158 --> 00:39:15,310
Speaker 0: you know, right your own chance or Bob but no one's gonna do that.

657
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:17,053
Speaker 0: That's effectively part of IRC Right.

658
00:39:18,592 --> 00:39:20,618
Speaker 1: But it's interesting that again all this culture like.

659
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:31,770
Speaker 1: there were ways to like block people ban people deal with stuff But it was very wild Westy And if you were smart enough you could get around any ban any problem.

660
00:39:32,092 --> 00:39:34,410
Speaker 1: You can always get in and fuck shit up and flood people.

661
00:39:35,132 --> 00:39:40,989
Speaker 1: There was no way to prevent it and that's why protocols like this like email the idea of spam is a problem because email

662
00:39:41,009 --> 00:39:41,049
Speaker 0: is

663
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:52,566
Speaker 1: A very similar system by my email server has to trust any email it gets And the best we can do is rely on blacklists and like heuristic searches and things to identify spam.

664
00:39:52,607 --> 00:39:56,418
Speaker 1: There's no sort of Inherent rate limiting in the protocol.

665
00:39:56,899 --> 00:40:01,974
Speaker 1: meanwhile AOL instant messenger being a sort of private proprietary thing Had that rate limit.

666
00:40:01,994 --> 00:40:06,330
Speaker 1: if I chat at you too much and you're not responding Maya eventually won't let me chat at you anymore.

667
00:40:06,852 --> 00:40:08,678
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, you're only connecting to the AOL server.

668
00:40:08,718 --> 00:40:10,263
Speaker 1: It knows they control everything.

669
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:12,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, there's so many servers, right?

670
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,397
Speaker 0: You can hit each one once.

671
00:40:13,417 --> 00:40:16,654
Speaker 1: this is the power of IRC You can have this.

672
00:40:16,874 --> 00:40:18,941
Speaker 1: IRC is really useful in my opinion.

673
00:40:18,981 --> 00:40:27,929
Speaker 1: nowadays along with BBS is for subverting Bad governments getting information around barriers and sharing things that are difficult or illegal to share.

674
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,221
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, it's so weird right.

675
00:40:29,262 --> 00:40:35,650
Speaker 0: on the one hand There's nothing about IRC that makes it any more or less secure than web or anything like right?

676
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:39,270
Speaker 0: It's just you're sending text over your internet wire, you know.

677
00:40:39,591 --> 00:40:42,930
Speaker 0: You could put encryption or some sort of tunnel on it with some other technology.

678
00:40:43,412 --> 00:40:45,559
Speaker 0: But now I mean, it's no different than the web.

679
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:48,910
Speaker 0: It's just a different protocol of bits going over TCP IP.

680
00:40:49,351 --> 00:40:52,083
Speaker 1: There's just so much going on and it's such a distributed structure.

681
00:40:52,143 --> 00:40:53,570
Speaker 1: It's very hard to police it.

682
00:40:53,770 --> 00:41:00,089
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the real big thing is that it's you know, most people when they use the internet quote, right?

683
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:08,630
Speaker 0: All the only applications that they really use on there, you know locally are the web browser, you know Almost 90% of everything is in the web browser.

684
00:41:09,531 --> 00:41:12,278
Speaker 0: Maybe they have a desktop email client like outlook.

685
00:41:12,819 --> 00:41:15,567
Speaker 0: Maybe something like iTunes will use some internet, right?

686
00:41:15,867 --> 00:41:16,509
Speaker 0: That's pretty much it.

687
00:41:18,095 --> 00:41:30,539
Speaker 0: so all these other applications that are internet protocols It's like just because the fact that most people don't know about them or use them Sort of makes them hidden from the public.

688
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:37,988
Speaker 0: just because they're not something that people know about You can just download them and use them for free no problem.

689
00:41:38,089 --> 00:41:44,850
Speaker 1: this day I have access to an internal IBM like straight-up listserv and there's just awesome tech discussions in there.

690
00:41:46,274 --> 00:41:49,970
Speaker 0: But it's like people just don't know about listserv so much except tech people.

691
00:41:50,052 --> 00:41:50,284
Speaker 0: Yeah.

692
00:41:50,470 --> 00:42:01,785
Speaker 0: So that whole part of the internet is super hidden away just by the nature of its obscurity and inaccessibility user interface and marketing which at the same time lends it a sort of mystique.

693
00:42:01,825 --> 00:42:18,019
Speaker 1: which is why I think like our own IRC channel is actually pretty popular and people nerds who use IRC because it's kind of this cool thing like the Super mundane people will never use IRC yeah, but the kind of slightly more hip people on the internet will use it because it's kind of a status symbol.

694
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:29,469
Speaker 1: and Once you're in IRC, it's interesting how the culture of IRC use Seems to have like like I know I've seen people hanging out in these chat rooms who clearly never used IRC in the 90s.

695
00:42:31,154 --> 00:42:36,359
Speaker 1: And yet they sort of Rediscover the same culture the the it's.

696
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,864
Speaker 1: we did that lecture.

697
00:42:37,904 --> 00:42:46,367
Speaker 1: the game makes the community the medium Makes the community in this case IRC community sort of forms the same way no matter who's using it.

698
00:42:46,608 --> 00:42:46,728
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

699
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:47,952
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just.

700
00:42:48,052 --> 00:42:55,114
Speaker 0: you know, there's a whole bunch of things like this, you know news groups also how because it's you know Hidden quote hidden.

701
00:42:55,175 --> 00:42:57,282
Speaker 0: It's not actually hidden, but it's just not.

702
00:42:57,643 --> 00:43:04,090
Speaker 0: you know, it doesn't put itself out there marketing wise And it doesn't put itself out there user interface like the hole-in-the-wall restaurant that no one knows about right?

703
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:10,143
Speaker 0: It's like you have to know about it You have to learn how to use it and you have to Intentionally go do it to get in there.

704
00:43:10,425 --> 00:43:20,347
Speaker 1: that when you're using it You sort of get this false feeling that you're in a hidden secret place And as you learn the details like once you realize that you change your nickname you start learning those slash commands.

705
00:43:20,708 --> 00:43:21,130
Speaker 1: you get this.

706
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:22,470
Speaker 1: Not necessarily false.

707
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:32,170
Speaker 1: But you get this sense of accomplishment that you've learned an archaic skill Much like how people use those fucking Bloomberg terminals feel really proud of themselves that they know how to use that terrible UI.

708
00:43:33,834 --> 00:43:41,190
Speaker 0: So what you get is you get you know Pretty much you get free node where open source people chat about their open source projects.

709
00:43:41,311 --> 00:43:43,241
Speaker 0: You get like, you know channels for Ubuntu.

710
00:43:43,321 --> 00:43:56,655
Speaker 0: pretty much every open source project the universe has a channel on free node and what they use it for is You know Usually the overall discussion on an open source project is gonna happen on a news group newsletter Not a news group a newsletter.

711
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:57,438
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

712
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,850
Speaker 0: or listserv and they might have a forum somewhere.

713
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:03,843
Speaker 0: Maybe they might have a bug tracker which has certain things.

714
00:44:04,205 --> 00:44:09,102
Speaker 0: but the IRC is Usually gonna be where you know, the real-time action happens.

715
00:44:09,122 --> 00:44:09,865
Speaker 0: You have a problem.

716
00:44:09,885 --> 00:44:11,250
Speaker 0: You need to get the answer right now.

717
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:12,479
Speaker 0: You couldn't find it on Google.

718
00:44:12,499 --> 00:44:13,205
Speaker 0: You couldn't wait for it.

719
00:44:13,285 --> 00:44:15,777
Speaker 0: on Stack Exchange You go to the IRC channel for the thing.

720
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:22,650
Speaker 0: you are the developers who actually work on the thing You know need to discuss and it's too slow for them to discuss in forums.

721
00:44:22,792 --> 00:44:34,030
Speaker 0: So they're always in the dev IRCs the big Ubuntu Ubuntu dev separate channel for the people who work on Ubuntu sitting in there hanging out talking about stuff You know because there's too many of them to use like an I am conversation.

722
00:44:34,731 --> 00:44:36,897
Speaker 0: Yeah, right You need to talk to all these people at once.

723
00:44:36,917 --> 00:44:39,930
Speaker 0: you're on some sort of team that needs to real-time communicate with each other.

724
00:44:40,431 --> 00:44:47,090
Speaker 0: All right, and these are the things that IRC still does and there really aren't any other chats out there.

725
00:44:47,291 --> 00:44:49,804
Speaker 0: You know the the I am protocols that are there.

726
00:44:49,925 --> 00:44:50,750
Speaker 1: They're too ephemeral.

727
00:44:51,011 --> 00:44:53,743
Speaker 0: You see anyone using G chat to have a real-time chat?

728
00:44:54,104 --> 00:44:56,653
Speaker 1: I do but again Right.

729
00:44:56,693 --> 00:45:01,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, I do often but it's very ephemeral and it lacks a lot of.

730
00:45:02,172 --> 00:45:05,585
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could use hangout but hangouts got like this video chat on it.

731
00:45:05,625 --> 00:45:06,750
Speaker 0: that's like when you start a hangout.

732
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:10,330
Speaker 0: That's a temporary, you know thing that's gonna have a start and an end time.

733
00:45:10,752 --> 00:45:16,519
Speaker 0: It's like for a meeting and IRC is like an always-on You know discussion between multiple people's.

734
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:17,563
Speaker 0: it's logged.

735
00:45:17,783 --> 00:45:19,730
Speaker 0: There's bots to do helpful things in there.

736
00:45:20,631 --> 00:45:23,060
Speaker 0: Right, you know and it's this really.

737
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:26,050
Speaker 0: nothing else has been able to compete with it in any way.

738
00:45:26,251 --> 00:45:32,529
Speaker 0: And even if you did make something that all the features but how to use their interface is accessible Perhaps web-based perhaps a nice application.

739
00:45:33,312 --> 00:45:35,540
Speaker 0: There's so much already in IRC.

740
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:41,582
Speaker 0: You couldn't get people to you know bail out of it Especially, you know with that network aspect.

741
00:45:41,622 --> 00:45:54,690
Speaker 0: That's really the thing is that you know You're you sign up you connect to this IRC network to join You know free node and you're always connected to the KDE channel because you're in the KDE community, right?

742
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:57,096
Speaker 0: Well, you're already connected to freenode all the time.

743
00:45:57,116 --> 00:46:05,543
Speaker 0: And now you have a question for someone who works on I don't know Firefox, I guess the Firefox channels also on freenode.

744
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:07,650
Speaker 0: I think they have a Mozilla one.

745
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:13,310
Speaker 0: It's separate but you know the channel for the other open source project you need to question about is also on freenode.

746
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:14,816
Speaker 0: so you're already on there too.

747
00:46:14,936 --> 00:46:18,369
Speaker 0: and now you're in two channels all the time and it just spreads like that.

748
00:46:18,389 --> 00:46:26,470
Speaker 0: and You know, you you would have to literally bring every single channel off of every IRC network to put any dent in that.

749
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:28,892
Speaker 0: It's probably gonna hang around Forever.

750
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:38,202
Speaker 0: Yeah, and as long as TCP IP is used and I think the culture is going to Persevere through all of that time as long as this Internet's is gonna be IRC.

751
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:41,030
Speaker 0: So it it might be worth your time.

752
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:42,278
Speaker 0: I mean, I you know, I used it.

753
00:46:42,318 --> 00:46:42,882
Speaker 0: I didn't use it.

754
00:46:42,922 --> 00:46:43,244
Speaker 0: I use it.

755
00:46:43,305 --> 00:46:43,808
Speaker 0: I didn't use it.

756
00:46:44,413 --> 00:46:56,569
Speaker 0: You know, sometimes I went in there to get files You know in the sort of dark ages of peer-to-peer like after Napster died But before BitTorrent came out I was using IRC to get animes and things like that.

757
00:46:57,533 --> 00:47:04,176
Speaker 0: But now, you know, some people still say IRC is the best place to get stuff Because people don't always make torrents of everything.

758
00:47:04,256 --> 00:47:11,435
Speaker 0: but you know the fansubbers themselves run the IRC channels where you can get everything But they're usually ops.

759
00:47:11,956 --> 00:47:13,460
Speaker 1: so you have to get in there.

760
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:17,345
Speaker 0: good grace and then people ability and then people do weird stuff like they'll have.

761
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:20,265
Speaker 0: You know, they'll have like ratios like you have to.

762
00:47:20,628 --> 00:47:22,316
Speaker 0: you know They'll have like these file servers.

763
00:47:22,436 --> 00:47:38,650
Speaker 0: in IRC you submit files to the file server like, okay I got to upload an anime So you upload it and get credits and you can use the credits to download some other anime But you can't upload something they already got Right and you're sort of contributing to this guy's file store needed to trade files.

764
00:47:38,791 --> 00:47:41,615
Speaker 0: Even though it's digital bits that are free I don't people trade them.

765
00:47:41,876 --> 00:47:46,636
Speaker 1: if you're going to get an idea of what now while some of these are somewhat fabricated Remember bash.org?

766
00:47:46,817 --> 00:47:47,078
Speaker 0: Yep.

767
00:47:47,841 --> 00:47:48,604

00:47:48,624 --> 00:47:50,974
Speaker 1: Just go here and read everything on the page I'm about to link to.

769
00:47:50,994 --> 00:47:53,307
Speaker 1: that's actually kind of what IRC is like.

770
00:47:53,548 --> 00:47:55,094
Speaker 0: Yep So I don't know.

771
00:47:55,114 --> 00:47:57,182
