00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,540
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday February 7th 2018.

2
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,803
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,823 --> 00:00:15,229
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:19,340
Speaker 0: We're finally talking about the delightful little witch academia.

5
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:21,537
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:24,628 --> 00:00:26,032
Speaker 1: So how about this weather?

7
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:29,120
Speaker 0: it sure is raining in New York City?

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,856
Speaker 0: Just kind of a shitty day and Scott Thought that was the first thing he thought of for like the opening bit to the show.

9
00:00:35,876 --> 00:00:36,338
Speaker 0: so here we go.

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,807
Speaker 1: Why don't we just skip the opening?

11
00:00:38,847 --> 00:00:40,012
Speaker 0: because get the opening big.

12
00:00:40,032 --> 00:00:40,795
Speaker 0: got to the opening bit.

13
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,965
Speaker 0: there's nothing going on Stuff going on.

14
00:00:43,005 --> 00:00:45,499
Speaker 0: There'll be no geek nights next week cuz I'm gonna be out of town.

15
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:47,119
Speaker 1: He's supposed to save that for the meta moment.

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,203
Speaker 1: What are you doing?

17
00:00:48,243 --> 00:00:50,811
Speaker 0: because the rain is actually.

18
00:00:50,831 --> 00:00:56,367
Speaker 0: it has a direct impact on why I'm going out of town Mm-hmm, so it's rain down here.

19
00:00:56,387 --> 00:01:00,760
Speaker 0: You're going where it's dry because that's the bottom half of a big ol snowstorm.

20
00:01:00,901 --> 00:01:03,900
Speaker 0: That's going up where I'm gonna be cuz I'm gonna be skiing out in New Hampshire all week.

21
00:01:04,421 --> 00:01:05,946
Speaker 0: I do on the annual trip.

22
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,213
Speaker 1: This is your last episode of geek nights everybody.

23
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:12,042
Speaker 0: Yeah one thing this season Stuff's changed.

24
00:01:12,123 --> 00:01:21,693
Speaker 0: like I ski a lot, but I kind of did up my game from a good skier to a real good skier I think And I'm excited to go back to this place, but

25
00:01:21,713 --> 00:01:25,228
Speaker 1: the only thing is ever heard of the Dunning Kruger face,

26
00:01:25,309 --> 00:01:27,640
Speaker 0: I'm well beyond that I'm just crude.

27
00:01:29,462 --> 00:01:35,233
Speaker 0: But one thing I'll say is that every year when I go to this place There's one mountain there that we never go to cannon Mountain.

28
00:01:35,253 --> 00:01:49,192
Speaker 0: because all the locals say So the way that mountain is facing supposedly all the other mountains in the area are kind of shielded from the wind So the snow lands on any way it's facing.

29
00:01:49,253 --> 00:01:52,826
Speaker 1: mountains are cones Facing in all directions.

30
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,472
Speaker 0: skiing part very few mountains.

31
00:01:54,492 --> 00:01:56,340
Speaker 0: you go to the top and ski off in any direction.

32
00:01:56,762 --> 00:01:59,152
Speaker 0: Usually there's like a direction to go like one side of the mountain.

33
00:01:59,413 --> 00:02:05,556
Speaker 1: one side of the mountains like you know Flatter and one side is straight up and down for most downhill skiing unless you're doing off-pitch stuff.

34
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:10,234
Speaker 0: They will Remove trees and make paths you're supposed to scan like they make a play.

35
00:02:10,253 --> 00:02:11,600
Speaker 1: Why don't they just do it on both sides?

36
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:16,324
Speaker 0: Uh, because then you gotta build lifts on both sides and that's pain in the ass There's usually no reason to.

37
00:02:16,565 --> 00:02:16,846
Speaker 1: I guess.

38
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:19,696
Speaker 0: I guess yeah some mountains have a little cuz.

39
00:02:19,716 --> 00:02:23,000
Speaker 1: you could go lift on one side Ski down the other lifts lift up the side.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,172
Speaker 0: Yeah, so some mountains do stuff like that.

41
00:02:25,213 --> 00:02:29,611
Speaker 0: some of the mountains I go to like loom There's like twice as much to this place to die.

42
00:02:29,712 --> 00:02:31,920
Speaker 0: Yes, you ski up and you ski down to a different place.

43
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,567
Speaker 0: The only problem is two lodges.

44
00:02:33,728 --> 00:02:37,366
Speaker 0: when they're that big one at the bottom and you could two parking lots, dude I bet there's ski places.

45
00:02:37,406 --> 00:02:39,440
Speaker 0: I've been to with two hotels six different lodges.

46
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,476
Speaker 0: The only problem is you might ski somewhere and get lost and then you're at some lodge.

47
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,480
Speaker 0: There's nowhere near your car.

48
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,380
Speaker 1: I'm thinking one mountain with a lot of different bottoms, right?

49
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,108
Speaker 1: So that way you're nicely you can't get lost.

50
00:02:49,148 --> 00:02:55,420
Speaker 1: you can go to the top of the mountain and go down to any bottom you Want but you just got to remember which one has your car, but also some mountains like at hunter.

51
00:02:55,621 --> 00:03:01,660
Speaker 0: There's one way to go down and at 3 30 the lift over there shuts down and there's no road that goes there.

52
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,484
Speaker 1: Well, don't do that.

53
00:03:02,664 --> 00:03:06,139
Speaker 0: If you ski over there good you get to walk a long way around the mountain.

54
00:03:07,204 --> 00:03:08,457
Speaker 1: They should just have at least have a shuttle bus.

55
00:03:09,242 --> 00:03:13,540
Speaker 0: What they do is they rope it off and the only people have this problem are people who go under the rope.

56
00:03:13,904 --> 00:03:14,309
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

57
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:14,694
Speaker 0: That's fine.

58
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:18,327
Speaker 0: Yeah but The snow is looking pretty good because.

59
00:03:18,427 --> 00:03:26,000
Speaker 0: but anyway, so I've always wanted to ski at this place called the midder cell Which is connected to the mountain we don't go to because it's facing the wrong way.

60
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,579
Speaker 0: So all the snow blows off of it supposedly.

61
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:29,266
Speaker 0: so the midder cell.

62
00:03:29,286 --> 00:03:34,519
Speaker 0: the deal with it is it was a ski resort a long time ago and It shut down and went bankrupt.

63
00:03:35,722 --> 00:03:40,918
Speaker 0: but for decades People would ski on the still active ski place that's next to it.

64
00:03:41,581 --> 00:03:46,580
Speaker 0: But they just hike over there and ski in the abandoned ski resort because that's fucking awesome.

65
00:03:46,921 --> 00:03:47,323
Speaker 1: What didn't?

66
00:03:47,363 --> 00:03:49,212
Speaker 1: new trees grow in it because no one does keep knocking.

67
00:03:49,232 --> 00:03:50,800
Speaker 0: that made it even more awesome.

68
00:03:51,285 --> 00:03:52,684
Speaker 1: Okay, this is definitely less So.

69
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,412
Speaker 0: Eventually the government and the ski resort everyone were like, alright if people are doing this.

70
00:03:59,553 --> 00:04:01,880
Speaker 0: Anyway, let's put a lift over there.

71
00:04:02,844 --> 00:04:04,419
Speaker 0: So people can just ski on this thing.

72
00:04:04,801 --> 00:04:12,954
Speaker 0: But the deal is they maintain the barest minimum level of safety But they don't groom it or do any of the stuff that the normal ski resort would.

73
00:04:13,235 --> 00:04:14,560
Speaker 0: so it's basically just wilderness.

74
00:04:15,042 --> 00:04:17,051
Speaker 0: That once was a ski resort.

75
00:04:17,071 --> 00:04:19,180
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and it seems awesome.

76
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:24,660
Speaker 1: Now they turned it from a ski resort to an abandoned mountain into a death trap.

77
00:04:24,994 --> 00:04:35,379
Speaker 0: Yeah So it's not actually that dangerous because I now that I got an oculus riff one thing I did is I went to all the Ski resorts and I actually went over and looked at this thing and saw like what it would be like to ski over there.

78
00:04:36,681 --> 00:04:45,972
Speaker 0: It ain't actually that big or that exciting and I could have the same sort of wilderness experience Just by poaching on any other normal mountain.

79
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:47,960
Speaker 0: So I think I'm gonna skip this place.

80
00:04:48,361 --> 00:04:53,357
Speaker 0: So the oculus saved me the trouble of going and finding out how underwhelming this place actually is.

81
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:56,770
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm That is my story, but it is not ski day.

82
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,794
Speaker 0: It's anime day.

83
00:04:57,814 --> 00:04:58,918
Speaker 0: So what do ya got?

84
00:04:58,938 --> 00:04:59,359
Speaker 0: some news?

85
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,742
Speaker 1: I do have a new.

86
00:05:00,762 --> 00:05:02,950
Speaker 0: why isn't there a skiing anime about hot ski boys?

87
00:05:03,472 --> 00:05:04,054
Speaker 1: There might be.

88
00:05:04,135 --> 00:05:05,038
Speaker 0: there will be someday.

89
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:05,520
Speaker 1: make one.

90
00:05:06,781 --> 00:05:22,079
Speaker 1: Anyway, so there's this guy named Dan slot, right and he his job for the past ten years has been to write Spider-man comics, I mean other people obviously have written spider-man comics besides him in the past ten years, but he's been the number one guy.

91
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,531
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, he's what he's the amazing spider-man like default spider-man.

92
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:29,544
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the thing is Dan slot writes Real good.

93
00:05:29,765 --> 00:05:30,968
Speaker 1: Like I actually like it.

94
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,613
Speaker 1: if I see him writing something.

95
00:05:32,634 --> 00:05:33,275
Speaker 1: that's a good sign.

96
00:05:33,296 --> 00:05:43,820
Speaker 1: There's actually a recent Silver Surfer comic series that like started and ended and The art Dan slot wrote it and the art is done by what's the guy's name?

97
00:05:44,842 --> 00:05:46,490
Speaker 1: Why do I keep forgetting this guy's name?

98
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:53,750
Speaker 1: I haven't really read any spider-man anyway, um Anyway, it's oh my god.

99
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,233
Speaker 1: I'm so mad.

100
00:05:54,273 --> 00:05:55,199
Speaker 1: I can't remember the guy's name.

101
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:57,540
Speaker 1: Anyway, there's a recent Silver Surfer series.

102
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,048
Speaker 1: The Dan slot wrote with this the artist.

103
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,312
Speaker 1: why I can't remember his name?

104
00:06:01,853 --> 00:06:04,040
Speaker 0: and I just start saying names of artists.

105
00:06:04,262 --> 00:06:05,249
Speaker 1: No, it's like top tier.

106
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:06,800
Speaker 1: It's just all red Mike all red.

107
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:09,860
Speaker 1: Okay, if you see Mike all right, you might not know the name Mike all red.

108
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,208
Speaker 1: But if you see his art, it's it's unique.

109
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:14,015
Speaker 1: You'll be like that fucking guy.

110
00:06:14,195 --> 00:06:15,440
Speaker 1: It's it's you know, it's one of those.

111
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,120
Speaker 0: We're like you said like when you see sanctuary and you're like at the manga and you're like, it's that guy exactly.

112
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,932
Speaker 1: It's like an art style that is completely unique and that you can totally tell it's him.

113
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:27,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, lazy Matsumoto first way exactly.

114
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,589
Speaker 1: So there's that recent Silver Surfer survey.

115
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,159
Speaker 1: Silver Surfer series is amazing and I want to read it.

116
00:06:32,481 --> 00:06:34,538
Speaker 1: It's like on my list as I'm like Kindle or whatever.

117
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:38,430
Speaker 1: Anyway, the news is that after 10 years of spider-man.

118
00:06:38,872 --> 00:06:41,880
Speaker 1: Dan slot is now gonna write Iron Man and I hate Iron Man.

119
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,543
Speaker 1: I'm in son.

120
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,591
Speaker 0: I don't know why you hate Iron Man sucks.

121
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:46,940
Speaker 0: Iron Man is like short of the alcoholism.

122
00:06:47,563 --> 00:06:49,313
Speaker 0: He's basically you but rich it.

123
00:06:49,695 --> 00:06:57,871
Speaker 1: yes piece of shit Anyway But maybe this will be the best Iron Man comic ever.

124
00:06:58,112 --> 00:07:00,920
Speaker 0: See the problem is I like characters.

125
00:07:01,081 --> 00:07:03,150
Speaker 0: I like stories that have characters that I hate.

126
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:05,460
Speaker 0: I don't know why you hate Iron Man stories so much.

127
00:07:05,523 --> 00:07:05,617
Speaker 0: Yeah

128
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:22,731
Speaker 1: but the thing is like I've been a fan of Dan slot actually for like a way long time even before the spider-man because when he First read when he when it first came out ten years ago He was writing the spider-man and I actually think I actually have the first spider-man comic he wrote I was like, wait a minute that seems familiar.

129
00:07:22,871 --> 00:07:30,560
Speaker 1: and I checked and it was true that the 1990s Marvel comics of Ren and Stimpy were written by Dan slot.

130
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:34,496
Speaker 1: And if you haven't read really if you haven't read that I did not know that.

131
00:07:34,516 --> 00:07:45,975
Speaker 1: if you haven't read those They are hysterical and awesome and you can see that same Humor writings in the spider-man and hopefully we can get some humorous Iron Man.

132
00:07:46,195 --> 00:07:47,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think you'll get some good Iron Man.

133
00:07:48,021 --> 00:07:49,907
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there you go.

134
00:07:50,028 --> 00:07:53,380
Speaker 1: No one cares about this news, but now you maybe semi-related lamblin.

135
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,048
Speaker 0: I actually I actually watched spider-man homecoming.

136
00:07:56,289 --> 00:07:59,739
Speaker 0: Okay, and it was probably the best spider-man movie they've ever made so far.

137
00:08:00,842 --> 00:08:02,858
Speaker 1: Mmm, I guess there's not a lot of kind of a better one.

138
00:08:03,301 --> 00:08:11,675
Speaker 0: Sure, the least smelly poop other than that old what 60s cartoon because that is not a movie though How it is, however, one of the most memorable things on earth.

139
00:08:12,318 --> 00:08:16,158
Speaker 0: Yeah That alone will make it famous forever amazing friends.

140
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,534
Speaker 0: But the one thing I'll say not even a geek bite but spider-man homecoming pretty good.

141
00:08:20,855 --> 00:08:22,240
Speaker 0: The only trouble with it is one.

142
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:30,574
Speaker 0: the only memorable moment Music wise in the entire soundtrack and score is in the very beginning.

143
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:40,320
Speaker 0: They evoke the spider-man theme like the one, you know Once and otherwise, it's the Marvel movie problem where it's just this bullshit score that goes nowhere.

144
00:08:40,522 --> 00:08:42,760
Speaker 1: And that was probably on your mind too because you saw the YouTube video.

145
00:08:42,841 --> 00:08:43,967
Speaker 0: I was thinking about it the whole time.

146
00:08:44,028 --> 00:08:50,120
Speaker 0: every time a song swelled in the background I was like this might as well be in Winter Soldier or whatever, which I didn't even say.

147
00:08:50,782 --> 00:08:51,827
Speaker 0: Like it literally energy.

148
00:08:52,068 --> 00:08:53,193
Speaker 0: This is the sad song.

149
00:08:53,253 --> 00:08:54,960
Speaker 0: This is the miniboss song.

150
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,366
Speaker 0: This is the climax saw.

151
00:08:56,406 --> 00:09:05,093
Speaker 1: no one's buying these, you know, I think also I was wondering Cuz back in the day we used to buy movie soundtracks with money.

152
00:09:05,173 --> 00:09:16,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, I bought the Independence Day sound You know, I bought these Star Wars episode 1 soundtrack Not just the original ones but I even bought like the matrix soundtrack was just a collection.

153
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,583
Speaker 0: Yeah, see the problems.

154
00:09:17,603 --> 00:09:20,291
Speaker 0: we keep saying bought but actually it was downloaded.

155
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:23,119
Speaker 1: Oh, no, this was night late early mid 90s.

156
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,102
Speaker 1: I bought some.

157
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:24,824
Speaker 0: yeah, I did buy.

158
00:09:24,844 --> 00:09:26,590
Speaker 0: well, yeah, I bought a few anyway.

159
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,560
Speaker 1: yet now there's no buying of soundtracks.

160
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,489
Speaker 0: Right video games actually been really pushing that hard.

161
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:35,700
Speaker 0: There is a big market for buying soundtracks to video games.

162
00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:36,840
Speaker 1: I'll also listen to on Spotify.

163
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,694
Speaker 1: But anyway, the point is is that because you're not making that extra money off the music?

164
00:09:42,175 --> 00:09:42,757
Speaker 1: is that?

165
00:09:42,817 --> 00:09:43,178
Speaker 1: I don't know.

166
00:09:43,258 --> 00:09:45,926
Speaker 1: if it is I'm just Hypothesizing does that?

167
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:49,238
Speaker 1: is that a reason that the movies are not bothering to me?

168
00:09:50,301 --> 00:09:52,840
Speaker 1: Original score because you're not making any money back on it.

169
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,665
Speaker 1: So just do it cheap.

170
00:09:53,765 --> 00:09:56,240
Speaker 0: in Gennaro cuz I mean we at my family we had the star.

171
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,407
Speaker 1: We're making the same amount of money on the movie.

172
00:09:58,467 --> 00:09:59,972
Speaker 1: If not more right.

173
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:08,396
Speaker 1: We had Star Wars vinyls when I was a kid Yeah, and then I still have a Star Wars cassette tape to to cassette tape set.

174
00:10:08,981 --> 00:10:18,360
Speaker 1: Because when the special when the special edition came out as bad as the special editions were they put all the soundtracks back out And the special edition soundtracks on cassette and CD were just fine.

175
00:10:18,721 --> 00:10:21,130
Speaker 0: Actually a lot of those a lot of people really are not.

176
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:24,804
Speaker 1: they do not specialize the soundtracks other than to make them 5.1 or whatever.

177
00:10:24,884 --> 00:10:29,120
Speaker 0: and also a lot of people are really down on cassettes because they seemed like this sort of interim bad technology.

178
00:10:29,222 --> 00:10:29,790
Speaker 0: That's fine.

179
00:10:30,054 --> 00:10:32,463
Speaker 0: Well Vinyl there.

180
00:10:32,664 --> 00:10:35,132
Speaker 0: I the usually when cassettes sounded bad.

181
00:10:35,173 --> 00:10:40,420
Speaker 0: It was because it was a cheapo cassette or The thing you're playing it back on was a piece of shit player.

182
00:10:40,581 --> 00:10:47,692
Speaker 0: Yep, like that the kind of thing with the vinyl vinyl sounds a lot better Was used too much and worn out like a VHS, yeah Yeah, but I was fighting.

183
00:10:47,712 --> 00:10:48,540
Speaker 0: my homecoming was pretty good.

184
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:58,169
Speaker 0: The only other complaint I had was that as good as it was it was like 15 to 20 minutes too long Mmm, and it had one too many fights.

185
00:10:59,072 --> 00:11:02,100
Speaker 1: I think I'm a little spider-man mood, you know, you should watch it.

186
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,305
Speaker 1: It's not that kind of span.

187
00:11:03,326 --> 00:11:05,817
Speaker 1: I think I get some spider-man comics and make you read him.

188
00:11:06,219 --> 00:11:08,899
Speaker 1: No All right, maybe I'll get some old ones that you won't like.

189
00:11:09,923 --> 00:11:11,254
Speaker 0: If I don't like him I'll still read him.

190
00:11:11,274 --> 00:11:11,960
Speaker 1: we'll talk about it.

191
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,160
Speaker 1: I'll get some old ones you won't like and also some dance a lot.

192
00:11:15,081 --> 00:11:15,824
Speaker 1: Read some spider-man.

193
00:11:16,687 --> 00:11:24,128
Speaker 0: The other funny thing was that you plays the villain in homecoming Michael Keaton, it's a Batman.

194
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:24,830
Speaker 0: Yeah.

195
00:11:24,991 --> 00:11:25,132
Speaker 0: Yeah.

196
00:11:25,453 --> 00:11:27,159
Speaker 0: Yeah the best Batman in my opinion.

197
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:31,388
Speaker 0: So in some other news you might have noticed this.

198
00:11:31,428 --> 00:11:33,094
Speaker 0: we just never talked about it is it?

199
00:11:33,535 --> 00:11:34,418
Speaker 0: but there's it's.

200
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,840
Speaker 0: see I don't know spider-man villains because I never really read spider-man or being Rhino Green Goblin.

201
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,679
Speaker 1: So the villain is doctor octopus.

202
00:11:43,061 --> 00:11:53,399
Speaker 0: There's the crew that leans up after alien superhero shit happens and this dude Runs like a demolition company that has the contract with New York City to do it.

203
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:59,499
Speaker 0: Okay, and then the in the Marvelverse the real government comes in and says no no, no, no government's doing this now.

204
00:12:00,222 --> 00:12:07,645
Speaker 0: So he just keeps all the alien tech that he found and builds this giant like owl hawk suit and flies around The vulture.

205
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:09,516
Speaker 0: maybe I don't know spider-man villain.

206
00:12:09,536 --> 00:12:10,260
Speaker 1: I think it's the vulture.

207
00:12:10,883 --> 00:12:12,189
Speaker 0: They don't really get into it.

208
00:12:12,229 --> 00:12:18,379
Speaker 0: as far as I can tell he is just Michael Keaton Who lost his union job and turned to a life of crime sounds like vulture to me?

209
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:22,653
Speaker 1: Vultures the old man who makes like a green robot suit and flies around.

210
00:12:22,693 --> 00:12:28,780
Speaker 0: but yeah, the suits really good though But the movies good partly because it does not do the origin story at all.

211
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,088
Speaker 0: It's just you fucking know who spider-man is.

212
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,353
Speaker 0: Here's spider-man.

213
00:12:32,373 --> 00:12:34,100
Speaker 0: He's already spider-man.

214
00:12:34,786 --> 00:12:35,473
Speaker 0: That's it there.

215
00:12:35,553 --> 00:12:38,528
Speaker 0: at no point Do you have to worry about how he becomes spider-man.

216
00:12:38,568 --> 00:12:42,200
Speaker 0: at no point does he have to worry about great power great responsibility?

217
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,567
Speaker 0: It's just I'm spider-man.

218
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:45,156
Speaker 0: There's a guy doing trouble.

219
00:12:45,276 --> 00:12:45,759
Speaker 0: I'ma get him.

220
00:12:47,213 --> 00:12:53,260
Speaker 0: so There's a short anime thing that you might have noticed around the internet occasionally, but you've probably seen this.

221
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,872
Speaker 1: I saw the title of it somewhere.

222
00:12:54,892 --> 00:12:59,168
Speaker 0: Yeah Aggressive Retsuko or just a Gretsuko.

223
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:03,866
Speaker 1: I saw the word a Gretsuko recently before you told me about it But I didn't look into it any further.

224
00:13:04,006 --> 00:13:04,207
Speaker 0: Yep.

225
00:13:04,227 --> 00:13:07,320
Speaker 0: So it's a Sanrio thing and the basic story is there's no Hello Kitty.

226
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:14,178
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's this cute red panda girl and she gets a job at her dream company, but she's basically like in.

227
00:13:14,198 --> 00:13:14,840
Speaker 1: what's the company?

228
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:15,683
Speaker 0: I don't know.

229
00:13:15,703 --> 00:13:16,206
Speaker 1: What do they do?

230
00:13:16,246 --> 00:13:16,689
Speaker 1: What do they do?

231
00:13:16,789 --> 00:13:24,099
Speaker 0: Who knows but she always wanted to work there But apparently her job is in the mail room and all her co-workers are pieces of shit.

232
00:13:24,702 --> 00:13:29,204
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess I mean if you work in the mail room, even at like the best company like, you know There is in the whole world.

233
00:13:29,224 --> 00:13:29,927
Speaker 1: It fucking sucks.

234
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:32,900
Speaker 0: So her co-workers suck and they're mean to her and her life starts to suck.

235
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,359
Speaker 1: Why would you be mean to the cute red panda?

236
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:46,680
Speaker 0: So by day, she's cute red panda doing her terrible office job and by night She takes all of the anger and rage in her heart from this shitty day job and converts it directly into death metal.

237
00:13:47,181 --> 00:13:49,588
Speaker 1: So it's Detroit metal city only with a cute red panda.

238
00:13:49,869 --> 00:13:50,150
Speaker 1: Yep.

239
00:13:50,912 --> 00:13:52,537
Speaker 1: So it's hello Detroit metals.

240
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:53,520
Speaker 1: Hello metal city.

241
00:13:53,861 --> 00:13:57,923
Speaker 0: So there were some shorts, I guess I'm like TBS Saturday morning Like there was something.

242
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:07,392
Speaker 0: but now Sanrio and Netflix teamed up to make it a 10 episode 15 minute along episode series.

243
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:09,080
Speaker 0: that's just gonna be on Netflix.

244
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,600
Speaker 1: Detroit metal city was also short series without a lot of episodes and we got a trailer.

245
00:14:14,003 --> 00:14:15,959
Speaker 1: Sure, not many episodes and short in length.

246
00:14:16,201 --> 00:14:16,281
Speaker 1: We

247
00:14:16,301 --> 00:14:28,920
Speaker 0: don't know who's doing the voice acting in this but already it sounds like it's some people we know But I couldn't look up who it was to confirm And it looks like the right level of production values and humor and I feel like it's gonna be worth watching.

248
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:33,718
Speaker 1: Mmm, that's I'll give that an episode cuz mostly because I ran out of Detroit metal city.

249
00:14:33,738 --> 00:14:36,808
Speaker 0: Yep Also Detroit metal city as much as I liked it.

250
00:14:36,848 --> 00:14:37,712
Speaker 0: It definitely had flaws.

251
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:43,503
Speaker 0: like it was not the greatest show No, it's still amazing Repetitive.

252
00:14:43,563 --> 00:14:44,126
Speaker 1: it is perfect.

253
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:49,430
Speaker 0: You really only needed to see a Couple episodes and then the one that ends with.

254
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:54,239
Speaker 0: but after all I'm a masochist Which I think is the best episode.

255
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,596
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day.

256
00:15:04,017 --> 00:15:12,050
Speaker 0: unless you lived under a rock you've probably seen this steamed hams meme Everywhere like you know, you might have heard it on geek nights months ago.

257
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:15,186
Speaker 1: It was my thing of the day way before it was a big thing.

258
00:15:15,226 --> 00:15:17,722
Speaker 1: like it is now I got in riding the ground floor.

259
00:15:17,742 --> 00:15:18,286
Speaker 1: cuz I'm cool.

260
00:15:18,326 --> 00:15:18,830
Speaker 1: I'm so smart.

261
00:15:19,111 --> 00:15:22,530
Speaker 0: I don't know if you did it first or I did because I had a thing of the day a while ago.

262
00:15:22,951 --> 00:15:26,943
Speaker 0: That was team hams set to a piano soundtrack.

263
00:15:27,003 --> 00:15:32,723
Speaker 1: someone go and check and I did Steamed hams guitar hero and that was.

264
00:15:32,744 --> 00:15:33,427
Speaker 0: that might have been.

265
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:34,070
Speaker 0: you might have beaten me.

266
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:34,794
Speaker 0: I think I remember that.

267
00:15:34,835 --> 00:15:40,170
Speaker 1: being first that was the first I'm pretty sure like That was like the day steamed hams began.

268
00:15:40,411 --> 00:15:46,549
Speaker 0: Well as a thing the thing is steamed hams well before it became a modern meme was a Simpsons episode.

269
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:48,716
Speaker 1: not well No, it was part of a Simpsons.

270
00:15:49,118 --> 00:15:56,164
Speaker 0: It was basically in my legit top 10 Simpsons scenes that I find funny in all of the Simpsons.

271
00:15:56,605 --> 00:15:57,890
Speaker 1: It's just one of my favorite bits.

272
00:15:58,452 --> 00:16:00,923
Speaker 1: I mean, I mean, it's good, but it's not one of my favorite.

273
00:16:00,983 --> 00:16:01,807
Speaker 0: It's no the shinin.

274
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:03,939
Speaker 1: Yes The chin and it's always number one.

275
00:16:03,979 --> 00:16:04,644
Speaker 1: It can't be beat.

276
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:07,947
Speaker 0: It's invincible Don't mind if I do.

277
00:16:10,231 --> 00:16:12,068
Speaker 0: But steamed hams is legit funny.

278
00:16:12,088 --> 00:16:18,023
Speaker 0: and To bring this around to its Wednesday of all the steamed hams edits.

279
00:16:18,585 --> 00:16:20,550
Speaker 0: This one had the most care and effort.

280
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:25,433
Speaker 1: I mean, there's a lot of them now that are way way way way way better than that guitar hero one I did.

281
00:16:25,533 --> 00:16:31,099
Speaker 1: Yeah, does that guitar hero one was so early It didn't have the stiff Competition and thus it made it to things of the day.

282
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:34,393
Speaker 1: if I had to pick a steamed ham today that wouldn't even make the Top 10.

283
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:41,680
Speaker 0: so not even I found this and I started watching it while Scott was in the other room getting ready to do the show And all I hear is Scott yell from the other room.

284
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,190
Speaker 0: That sounds like some Gundam.

285
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:49,245
Speaker 0: This is steamed hams edited to be like an episode of old Gundam.

286
00:16:49,285 --> 00:16:50,490
Speaker 1: I saw this a few days ago.

287
00:16:50,651 --> 00:16:52,158
Speaker 1: I don't even think this is top five.

288
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,826
Speaker 0: It's top ten, but you're right.

289
00:16:53,866 --> 00:16:54,670
Speaker 0: It's not top five.

290
00:16:55,394 --> 00:16:57,950
Speaker 1: The problem is I've seen some ones that are so good.

291
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:02,449
Speaker 0: The problem is the ones that are the best are a little high concept and a little like they're there.

292
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:04,741
Speaker 1: I saw I saw a JPEG on Twitter.

293
00:17:04,761 --> 00:17:06,028
Speaker 1: That was Junji Ito.

294
00:17:06,048 --> 00:17:09,715
Speaker 1: stick Right, it's like come on.

295
00:17:10,499 --> 00:17:11,340
Speaker 0: I just love that.

296
00:17:11,381 --> 00:17:12,163
Speaker 0: This is a thing.

297
00:17:12,183 --> 00:17:13,467
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

298
00:17:13,487 --> 00:17:14,189
Speaker 0: So what do you have for me?

299
00:17:15,771 --> 00:17:19,001
Speaker 1: So we talked about Japanese animation a lot.

300
00:17:19,462 --> 00:17:22,030
Speaker 1: we talked about comics from all countries a lot.

301
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:31,563
Speaker 1: We talked about animation from Ireland and US and all the places right but one thing kind of animation We don't talk about a lot is animation.

302
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,569
Speaker 1: That's not really done anymore.

303
00:17:33,091 --> 00:17:39,150
Speaker 1: Nah, which is the animations of the likes of which we saw in the Monty Python days.

304
00:17:39,471 --> 00:17:46,290
Speaker 1: It's a bunch of crap from magazines and cut it out and move it around a lot like South Park did with construction paper.

305
00:17:46,411 --> 00:17:51,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, only he used photographs and other things, you know same idea.

306
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:58,922
Speaker 0: It's hard to understate or it's hard to overstate really how Desperately funny I to this day find money Python.

307
00:17:59,243 --> 00:18:03,262
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, it's still like the best anyway, so Those animations like.

308
00:18:03,323 --> 00:18:07,748
Speaker 1: no one's done animation like that Before or since.

309
00:18:11,192 --> 00:18:17,398
Speaker 1: It's never been like part of a real, you know thing right it's like doesn't Like what like there's a lot.

310
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:18,524
Speaker 1: what movie does that?

311
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:19,570
Speaker 1: what TV show does that?

312
00:18:21,723 --> 00:18:23,476
Speaker 0: I've just seen like shorts and things on YouTube.

313
00:18:23,516 --> 00:18:24,664
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure But there's no.

314
00:18:24,825 --> 00:18:25,428
Speaker 1: no one's like.

315
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,419
Speaker 1: not that nobody on earth is doing this.

316
00:18:27,721 --> 00:18:34,499
Speaker 1: I'm saying like no movie TV show or you know, mass publicized media is using that sort of thing.

317
00:18:34,579 --> 00:18:44,002
Speaker 1: Anyway This video my thing of the day is incredible because Here is here is Terry Gilliam sitting with somebody I don't know who.

318
00:18:44,043 --> 00:18:48,560
Speaker 1: it is some some British TV person showing you exactly how he does it.

319
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,494
Speaker 1: He's got the actual cutouts he used in the real animations and he's showing you how they move.

320
00:18:53,835 --> 00:18:54,336
Speaker 1: and it's like.

321
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:58,510
Speaker 1: it is way way Fascinating and it makes you think oh man, I could do that.

322
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:02,645
Speaker 1: It's like I know not really I can't do that it I'm pretty sure.

323
00:19:02,705 --> 00:19:05,540
Speaker 0: I saw this on a VHS tape at some point.

324
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,580
Speaker 1: It definitely looks like someone took this from a VHS tape and put it on YouTube.

325
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,760
Speaker 1: But man that VHS tape was in good condition.

326
00:19:11,181 --> 00:19:16,554
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I'm seeing VHS tapes actually had higher quality than most TVs could display.

327
00:19:16,574 --> 00:19:17,015
Speaker 0: That's true.

328
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,650
Speaker 0: I Kind of want to watch the Monty Python now.

329
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:21,514
Speaker 1: Yeah, why not?

330
00:19:21,695 --> 00:19:22,238
Speaker 0: I'm feeling it.

331
00:19:23,566 --> 00:19:24,357
Speaker 0: Have we ever?

332
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,638
Speaker 0: Reviewed a Monty Python thing on gig night.

333
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,065
Speaker 1: Yes There's like one of the first episodes.

334
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,350
Speaker 1: the ignites is Monty Python.

335
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:34,565
Speaker 1: cuz at that time when geek nights are starting in 2005 We were watching every single episode on.

336
00:19:34,585 --> 00:19:35,227
Speaker 1: that's right.

337
00:19:35,247 --> 00:19:38,636
Speaker 0: Cuz we had that box set that my mom got me every single episode.

338
00:19:38,657 --> 00:19:40,863
Speaker 0: I Just wonder what I feel like.

339
00:19:40,984 --> 00:19:42,208
Speaker 0: maybe we could get away.

340
00:19:42,228 --> 00:19:44,234
Speaker 1: We could go watch like the Holy Grail.

341
00:19:44,254 --> 00:19:44,595
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

342
00:19:44,615 --> 00:19:47,912
Speaker 0: Yeah, we We talked.

343
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:51,539
Speaker 0: no, no, no, we've never done it.

344
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,003
Speaker 1: How have we not?

345
00:19:53,404 --> 00:19:54,127
Speaker 1: it's not possible.

346
00:19:54,187 --> 00:19:54,769
Speaker 1: Is that an episode?

347
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:55,512
Speaker 0: Here's the only one.

348
00:19:55,552 --> 00:19:56,716
Speaker 0: here's the only one.

349
00:19:56,756 --> 00:19:57,800
Speaker 1: did rim delete this episode?

350
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,915
Speaker 1: He planned this in advance.

351
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:08,534
Speaker 1: Uh My thing of the day that I definitely didn't tell him before Tuesday Thursday March 27 2008 that the episode is called.

352
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:09,579
Speaker 0: What do we do?

353
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,485
Speaker 0: Tonight on gig nights.

354
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:13,800
Speaker 0: We had intended to talk about Monty Python.

355
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:26,620
Speaker 0: Instead after some politics Scott repeatedly We got sidetracked by some some shitty thing that happened in politics and we ended up talking for an hour about politics Instead of talking about Monty Python.

356
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,431
Speaker 1: Another great reason to not talk about politics on geek and whatever.

357
00:20:29,471 --> 00:20:31,580
Speaker 0: the thing is that we talked about is gone.

358
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:31,981
Speaker 0: It's too.

359
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:32,643
Speaker 0: 404 errors.

360
00:20:32,843 --> 00:20:34,287
Speaker 0: So I have no idea all.

361
00:20:35,571 --> 00:20:38,740
Speaker 0: I'm afraid we spend much of tonight's show talking about something very sad.

362
00:20:39,502 --> 00:20:41,008
Speaker 0: We're really mad about something.

363
00:20:41,048 --> 00:20:47,279
Speaker 0: in 2008 Scott drove the entire conversation And I don't think there's any way to know what the fuck we talked about.

364
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,207
Speaker 0: Hmm now I'm really curious.

365
00:20:49,267 --> 00:20:51,215
Speaker 1: who like those kinds of episodes of geek nights.

366
00:20:51,255 --> 00:20:52,119
Speaker 1: Well, they're still out there.

367
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,610
Speaker 0: uh, oh I figured out what it was.

368
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,520
Speaker 1: Oh you went to the forum the fuck.

369
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,784
Speaker 0: So I still don't know.

370
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:07,855
Speaker 0: but the forum is all posts like wow that really turns my stomach You know, like people are like, oh, I didn't even want to do this episode.

371
00:21:07,876 --> 00:21:09,462
Speaker 0: Oh That's tough.

372
00:21:09,824 --> 00:21:13,700
Speaker 0: I think it's parents not treating their kids because they're religious and then the kids die.

373
00:21:14,202 --> 00:21:14,886
Speaker 1: Oh, is that what I think?

374
00:21:14,926 --> 00:21:16,072
Speaker 0: that's what we were talking about.

375
00:21:16,092 --> 00:21:17,198
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember that.

376
00:21:17,338 --> 00:21:21,920
Speaker 0: Yep So I feel like we've never talked about Monty Python and geek nights.

377
00:21:23,102 --> 00:21:24,651
Speaker 0: Mmm think that's gotta happen.

378
00:21:25,114 --> 00:21:25,215
Speaker 1: Mmm.

379
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:25,959
Speaker 0: I think we should walk.

380
00:21:26,684 --> 00:21:26,946
Speaker 0: Should we?

381
00:21:27,147 --> 00:21:29,100
Speaker 0: should we review the Holy Grail or life of Brian?

382
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,795
Speaker 1: The Holy Grail is the Holy Grail true, but life of Brian is also the holy.

383
00:21:33,855 --> 00:21:34,116
Speaker 1: Yeah.

384
00:21:34,136 --> 00:21:36,788
Speaker 1: Yeah But only figuratively.

385
00:21:36,808 --> 00:21:38,275
Speaker 1: was the other one is literally and figured.

386
00:21:38,295 --> 00:21:46,877
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, anyway in the meta moment We are book club book is Emily Wilson's new modern translation of the Odyssey by Homer.

387
00:21:46,897 --> 00:21:52,380
Speaker 0: Oh, man Writing Homer like us talking Homer were they not the same?

388
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:56,252
Speaker 1: I want to go like a thousand two thousand years three thousand years in the future.

389
00:21:56,332 --> 00:22:01,169
Speaker 1: Will people be confused between Human history between the different homeless.

390
00:22:01,249 --> 00:22:08,280
Speaker 0: I mean already kids on the internet today Think that a lot of things they make fun of or reference came from the Simpsons.

391
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:09,666
Speaker 1: I want it's literally.

392
00:22:09,706 --> 00:22:12,577
Speaker 0: do not know that the Simpsons was itself referencing older thing.

393
00:22:12,658 --> 00:22:18,520
Speaker 1: at some point those kids will be old people and we will all be dead and That will be the knowledge of humanity.

394
00:22:18,942 --> 00:22:26,108
Speaker 0: What was that video I found where someone was like check out all these references you missed and one of them was saying Badges, we don't need no stinking badges.

395
00:22:26,168 --> 00:22:26,750
Speaker 0: and they were like.

396
00:22:27,031 --> 00:22:29,520
Speaker 0: this was a joke on this episode of the Simpsons.

397
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,050
Speaker 0: Yes, how many people right what at least go back to Beverly Hills?

398
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,943
Speaker 0: Girl Scout movie.

399
00:22:36,043 --> 00:22:42,400
Speaker 1: How do you know how else which I saw the how do you know that in treasure of Sierra Madre when they Say badges, we don't need no stinking badges.

400
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:47,132
Speaker 1: They are not in turn referencing something from that is even older that we do not know.

401
00:22:47,152 --> 00:22:49,819
Speaker 0: I'm confident that it is from that.

402
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,306
Speaker 0: how Confident, you know what?

403
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:55,917
Speaker 0: I'm gonna start trying to get people to believe that it actually came first.

404
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:56,820
Speaker 0: in true, Beverly Hills.

405
00:22:57,182 --> 00:23:00,640
Speaker 1: I think the problem is most people believe is from Blazing Saddles and not treasure.

406
00:23:04,004 --> 00:23:08,020
Speaker 1: How many people are sitting there thinking I was it wasn't the Simpsons it was Blazing Saddles.

407
00:23:08,662 --> 00:23:10,599
Speaker 1: Turns out the Scott knows more than you do.

408
00:23:11,281 --> 00:23:16,340
Speaker 1: Tell you guys in fact is willing to believe that someone else knows more than he does and that church there Madre wasn't the first.

409
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,127
Speaker 0: I'm telling you guys.

410
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:20,919
Speaker 0: It's true, Beverly Hills Sure, which I remember.

411
00:23:23,025 --> 00:23:24,228
Speaker 0: I feel like my parents took me.

412
00:23:24,268 --> 00:23:26,615
Speaker 1: how do you know steam dams isn't referencing something else?

413
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:32,034
Speaker 0: I Imagine if it's referencing anything it's referencing some old Vaudeville.

414
00:23:32,054 --> 00:23:33,279
Speaker 0: It's basically you know what it is.

415
00:23:34,023 --> 00:23:36,796
Speaker 0: It's sort of a like a modern take on a vaudeville bit.

416
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:43,555
Speaker 0: I'm just saying Anyway, a bunch of the talks we've given at conventions recently are on YouTube.

417
00:23:43,575 --> 00:23:44,439
Speaker 0: You can just see them.

448
00:24:57,391 --> 00:24:58,876
Speaker 1: before there was kill la kill.

449
00:24:59,036 --> 00:25:00,100
Speaker 1: before there was any of the.

450
00:25:00,604 --> 00:25:04,810
Speaker 1: Before I think there was even Fucking inferno cop.

451
00:25:04,911 --> 00:25:09,032
Speaker 1: I I don't know I don't know if it was before turning girls, which wasn't technically.

452
00:25:09,052 --> 00:25:10,738
Speaker 1: studio trigger was like basically the same people.

453
00:25:10,779 --> 00:25:12,548
Speaker 0: Well, he was 2013.

454
00:25:12,548 --> 00:25:16,835
Speaker 1: I don't know the timeline here But the point is one of the first time I ever heard of studio trigger was with.

455
00:25:16,876 --> 00:25:22,573
Speaker 1: it was the little wet Academia short that went online from the young animators training project.

456
00:25:22,613 --> 00:25:24,559
Speaker 1: Yeah, we I saw it and I said, holy shit.

457
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:25,100
Speaker 1: That was great.

458
00:25:27,063 --> 00:25:29,613
Speaker 0: You were like it's it's mode sky tie.

459
00:25:29,634 --> 00:25:31,160
Speaker 0: I think it's something.

460
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:32,926
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway, and then there was.

461
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:34,471
Speaker 1: they were kick-starting a movie.

462
00:25:34,511 --> 00:25:35,373
Speaker 1: I think so.

463
00:25:35,674 --> 00:25:45,240
Speaker 0: The original short was I'm not gonna review it again But it was shall we say very well received and it was one of the many things that saved anime in that era.

464
00:25:46,064 --> 00:25:48,378
Speaker 1: So it was a trigger in general.

465
00:25:48,479 --> 00:25:58,266
Speaker 0: Yep so it was so it was so successful that studio triggered put went to make a Sequel to it the enchanted parade two years later And they made it.

466
00:25:58,366 --> 00:26:01,360
Speaker 0: it was bigger budget like they made it on purpose with a budget.

467
00:26:01,461 --> 00:26:03,740
Speaker 1: I think there was Kickstarter money and perhaps it was money.

468
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:10,940
Speaker 0: It was quote-unquote kick-started but the kick-starting was a very minor part of its overall budget as far as I can tell.

469
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,027
Speaker 1: I don't remember even remember the rewards were or anything.

470
00:26:13,107 --> 00:26:22,020
Speaker 1: It was definitely a Kickstarter really in there somewhere anyway, so then in 2017 with the money of Netflix they made a real anime.

471
00:26:22,731 --> 00:26:28,259
Speaker 1: That was a 2025 episode TV series where the episodes were 20 to 30 minutes long.

472
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:36,851
Speaker 0: Yep They made a full-on series on Netflix and the deal is they did they kind of like in the old days Which I think at this point most of the people isn't a geek guys wouldn't?

473
00:26:36,891 --> 00:26:40,819
Speaker 1: I think it's technically two seasons like one is 13 And one is 12, but it doesn't matter.

474
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,505
Speaker 0: There were a bunch of anime.

475
00:26:42,565 --> 00:26:45,615
Speaker 1: the opener changes around episode 12 or 13 and that makes it to see.

476
00:26:45,675 --> 00:26:49,349
Speaker 0: it's basically - it's if you Think of it like it's a 25 episode show.

477
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:55,514
Speaker 0: if you're a we watching it in anime club You would treat it as two different seasons, but it's basically just one show.

478
00:26:55,534 --> 00:27:03,680
Speaker 0: the world's different now But it was a reboot of the original short and movie, right?

479
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:07,311
Speaker 1: So the short and the movie each standalone separate from each other like.

480
00:27:07,332 --> 00:27:09,920
Speaker 1: there's no continuity between them except for the characters.

481
00:27:10,221 --> 00:27:12,131
Speaker 1: Yeah, they both stand alone independently.

482
00:27:12,553 --> 00:27:19,547
Speaker 1: the TV show Has the same characters the same setting but it Resets the time.

483
00:27:19,627 --> 00:27:26,059
Speaker 1: some of the things that happened in those movies and sure are still true But they those events didn't actually happen.

484
00:27:26,843 --> 00:27:30,580
Speaker 1: Instead it starts back at the beginning where the characters arrive at the school, right?

485
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:35,700
Speaker 0: It's it's a magic for witches steps back and as a longer arc for the main character Akko, right?

486
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,568
Speaker 1: But the basic plot is actually still like.

487
00:27:38,628 --> 00:27:41,837
Speaker 1: a lot of the stuff is still the same right and unchanged.

488
00:27:42,018 --> 00:27:45,549
Speaker 0: cute delightful Witches have adventures and make mischief.

489
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:48,860
Speaker 1: there's added characters that weren't in the original two things.

490
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,320
Speaker 0: There's kind of a like low-key utenna style villain toward the end like an odd that Akio character.

491
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,452
Speaker 1: Yeah, a little bit.

492
00:27:55,472 --> 00:27:56,058
Speaker 0: Yeah a little bit.

493
00:27:56,542 --> 00:28:00,520
Speaker 0: But what's funny is that this sort of thing happened a bunch of times in the old days.

494
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,426
Speaker 0: There was like the tenchi muyo av.

495
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:08,750
Speaker 0: then there was the tenchi muyo TV series that were the same characters Kind of a different story Patla.

496
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:10,520
Speaker 1: Patla bore a very similar situation.

497
00:28:10,781 --> 00:28:12,006
Speaker 1: Yeah, Patla bore OAV.

498
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:12,588
Speaker 1: those the first.

499
00:28:12,648 --> 00:28:15,580
Speaker 1: Patla Lazard had the OAV and there was TV one.

500
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:19,905
Speaker 1: Then there was TV two and there were two movies and then they go after the second movie.

501
00:28:19,925 --> 00:28:27,686
Speaker 1: they started coming out with like fucking more movies that didn't even have the main characters in them, but Ella's art in a Tenchi muyo are more analogous to this.

502
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:35,060
Speaker 0: because they had an OAV that was short and good and then they took the same characters And basically did it again longer as a TV show.

503
00:28:35,604 --> 00:28:40,336
Speaker 0: The big difference is in both those cases The TV show was kind of shit compared to the original OAV.

504
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:44,190
Speaker 0: in this case The TV show is just as good as the original away.

505
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:47,922
Speaker 1: So at this point I have seen every little bit academia thing There is to see.

506
00:28:48,123 --> 00:28:48,664
Speaker 0: Yep.

507
00:28:48,704 --> 00:28:51,873
Speaker 0: The only things we have not consumed are the manga.

508
00:28:51,893 --> 00:28:54,180
Speaker 0: Nope, which there's only one volume.

509
00:28:54,381 --> 00:28:55,244
Speaker 1: I think I'm good.

510
00:28:55,987 --> 00:28:58,076
Speaker 0: It says it's saying it it might be good, but I don't really care.

511
00:28:58,116 --> 00:28:59,020
Speaker 0: I guess there's two mangas.

512
00:28:59,321 --> 00:28:59,602
Speaker 1: I don't know.

513
00:28:59,683 --> 00:29:00,024
Speaker 1: I'm good.

514
00:29:00,285 --> 00:29:03,880
Speaker 0: Whoa, there's a sane in manga and a Shonen manga and a shoujo manga.

515
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:04,463
Speaker 1: I don't know.

516
00:29:04,483 --> 00:29:05,207
Speaker 1: I don't need to read them.

517
00:29:05,307 --> 00:29:13,390
Speaker 0: I'm good in ultra jump ribbon and yen, oh, that's a katakawa, okay Monthly Shonen ace.

518
00:29:13,754 --> 00:29:16,084
Speaker 0: Yep, I Get you, you know, it's funny.

519
00:29:16,104 --> 00:29:22,977
Speaker 0: They did the same thing with eska flown a. there was like a Shonen manga and a shoujo manga and then they were both just steaming piles of garbage.

520
00:29:23,861 --> 00:29:24,183
Speaker 0: They were.

521
00:29:24,244 --> 00:29:25,855
Speaker 1: I don't know that these manga are bad or just.

522
00:29:25,915 --> 00:29:28,794
Speaker 1: I don't need I don't need to But those eska flown a. I got enough comics to read.

523
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:29,136
Speaker 1: I'm good.

524
00:29:29,458 --> 00:29:34,380
Speaker 0: Yep So we kind of want to review the entire franchise as a whole.

525
00:29:35,002 --> 00:29:39,900
Speaker 0: But we're not gonna talk in detail about the original OAV because we talked about that in depth, right?

526
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,582
Speaker 1: So let's talk about that.

527
00:29:40,622 --> 00:29:42,628
Speaker 1: that movie first the the parade one.

528
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:46,340
Speaker 0: I really basically the bits just if you liked the short.

529
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:48,569
Speaker 0: It's a longer bigger budget thing.

530
00:29:49,112 --> 00:29:49,313
Speaker 1: Yeah.

531
00:29:49,373 --> 00:29:53,626
Speaker 1: I mean it sort of has this really stereotypical Kids movie sort of plot.

532
00:29:53,806 --> 00:30:01,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, right where you know, it really felt a lot like a lot of animated American kids movies I saw when only obviously anime.

533
00:30:02,087 --> 00:30:16,868
Speaker 1: Yeah instead you know that they have to do a thing their kids in school and then a monster comes out for them to fight at the end and there's some Subconflicts, it's really just an excuse to have these characters interacting in a crazy and also introduces other characters.

534
00:30:16,928 --> 00:30:29,979
Speaker 1: that then our characters in the TV show the the Amanda the awesome athletic girl who's a troublemaker the girl who's a really non character the donut eating one and The mecha one who actually gets one episode in the TV.

535
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:34,176
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the donut eating one does not get an episode in the TV show and that's kind of like.

536
00:30:34,217 --> 00:30:35,040
Speaker 1: why is she even there?

537
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,320
Speaker 0: I kept expecting her to get one and she's just like this joke off to the side.

538
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:46,840
Speaker 1: She you know what she reminds me of on The Muppet Show the dynamite guy Crazy, whatever his name is they did kind of use her like to break up a scene, right?

539
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:53,548
Speaker 1: All she does is this one joke and she just pops in does the joke and pops away just just like dynamite guy Crazy, what's his name?

540
00:30:53,568 --> 00:30:54,151
Speaker 1: crazy something.

541
00:30:54,412 --> 00:30:58,620
Speaker 0: there were a few other characters like that But anyway, so yeah, the the enchanted parade is literally.

542
00:31:00,342 --> 00:31:01,693
Speaker 0: If you're an anime fan, you should watch it.

543
00:31:01,753 --> 00:31:04,122
Speaker 0: It's a movie and it's great Like.

544
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:04,965
Speaker 0: I don't know what else to say.

545
00:31:05,025 --> 00:31:08,900
Speaker 0: It's cute witches doing stuff super well animated super fun.

546
00:31:09,343 --> 00:31:10,732
Speaker 0: Don't worry about the plot so much.

547
00:31:10,813 --> 00:31:11,074
Speaker 0: It's just.

548
00:31:11,175 --> 00:31:11,880
Speaker 1: it's crazy Harry.

549
00:31:15,801 --> 00:31:20,680
Speaker 0: So the TV series which the only reason we didn't review it until now because I watch it a long time ago.

550
00:31:21,861 --> 00:31:22,724
Speaker 0: Scott didn't have Netflix.

551
00:31:22,745 --> 00:31:24,812
Speaker 0: Scott got Netflix again canceled Hulu.

552
00:31:24,832 --> 00:31:26,458
Speaker 1: I got Netflix not watching Netflix stuff.

553
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:32,618
Speaker 0: Yep so in a nutshell If you were an anime fan at all, you should definitely watch it.

554
00:31:32,968 --> 00:31:35,807
Speaker 0: Yeah I actually think this is a great show.

555
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:42,932
Speaker 0: if you know someone who professes to not like anime or just never watched anime It's just a great show and you just get people to watch it.

556
00:31:43,053 --> 00:31:46,404
Speaker 1: Yeah, this show has nothing Objectionable about.

557
00:31:46,685 --> 00:31:51,704
Speaker 1: you know things that you might object to in animes doesn't have extreme violence Doesn't have weeb shit.

558
00:31:51,965 --> 00:31:56,680
Speaker 1: It doesn't have pretty much anything that's gonna turn someone away who is not an anime fan.

559
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:07,807
Speaker 1: meanwhile, look at the show why it still has the structure and Tropes of being an anime TV series unlike say a Ghibli movie where a lot of people like Ghibli movies But don't like any other anime.

560
00:32:07,988 --> 00:32:20,416
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you like this you're gonna like, you know You could go from this to a full metal alchemist or whatever But as the accessibility of kids in magical school story Which is a story that a lot of people apparently like even though it's been done a hundred times

561
00:32:20,616 --> 00:32:28,420
Speaker 0: and it also does a pretty Good job of having a pretty good plot to keep things going and have sort of a destination for the show to go.

562
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,826
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's actually.

563
00:32:29,846 --> 00:32:36,572
Speaker 1: I think the plot is as issues but the I think The characters are very strong pretty good in that.

564
00:32:36,813 --> 00:32:41,780
Speaker 0: So it is a lot of this solely To take the characters and drag them through this arc.

565
00:32:42,402 --> 00:32:50,379
Speaker 1: There's a lot of anime out there and a lot of things in general these days were like this sort of a terrible secret of Space or some kind of plot where I want to know the deal.

566
00:32:50,673 --> 00:32:58,220
Speaker 1: Yeah I don't actually care about any of the characters like I wouldn't put stickers of the characters on my laptop or on my wallpaper, right?

567
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,684
Speaker 1: Yeah, little witch academia.

568
00:32:59,704 --> 00:33:04,058
Speaker 1: There's gonna be a character that's gonna be your fave if you watch this show, right?

569
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,106
Speaker 1: You know, it's it's.

570
00:33:06,247 --> 00:33:08,400
Speaker 1: there's gonna be someone because the characters stand out.

571
00:33:08,641 --> 00:33:13,573
Speaker 0: Well, cuz the characters are all great and varied but the plot I guess is just.

572
00:33:13,654 --> 00:33:23,120
Speaker 0: it's good enough to give the context for the characters to be pulled through these arcs and It also does go a little like it goes a little darker than I expected.

573
00:33:23,682 --> 00:33:24,908
Speaker 1: But I mean you get riches.

574
00:33:24,948 --> 00:33:34,200
Speaker 0: you got to go dark someone but when it hits the dark spot It had a chance to go way dark and it hints that it's gonna go away dark and it holds back.

575
00:33:34,421 --> 00:33:41,071
Speaker 0: Yeah, it kind of bounces off of that instead of going way dark and goes back to Trigger little witch academia.

576
00:33:41,111 --> 00:33:41,473
Speaker 0: Let's go.

577
00:33:41,554 --> 00:33:42,117
Speaker 0: It's witches.

578
00:33:42,137 --> 00:33:48,880
Speaker 1: Yeah So the thing about the plot that bothers me is not that it's a bad plot is that it feels like as you're watching it.

579
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,700
Speaker 1: I don't know if this how this lines up with like the season divide.

580
00:33:51,762 --> 00:33:55,560
Speaker 1: Yeah It feels almost like they sort of rewrote stuff as they went along.

581
00:33:55,981 --> 00:34:02,887
Speaker 1: Like the first part is like very episodic learning that and then it's like suddenly they're like, oh by the way There's these seven words.

582
00:34:02,948 --> 00:34:04,095
Speaker 1: I forget how many words it is.

583
00:34:04,135 --> 00:34:12,340
Speaker 1: nine words Well, so they sort of just push that in immediately with like no pre like foreshadowing for that.

584
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,101
Speaker 1: It's just a season.

585
00:34:13,322 --> 00:34:18,639
Speaker 0: one sets it up in the most minimal way where she can't do magic and everyone else can.

586
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:19,723
Speaker 0: It's kind of an open question.

587
00:34:20,043 --> 00:34:22,130
Speaker 0: Why is Akko so shitty at magic?

588
00:34:22,492 --> 00:34:24,679
Speaker 0: Well, literally everyone else can do magic.

589
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:27,004
Speaker 0: fine Literally everyone right.

590
00:34:27,043 --> 00:34:28,208
Speaker 1: but it doesn't feel like that.

591
00:34:28,268 --> 00:34:30,395
Speaker 1: that was part of the the way the two.

592
00:34:30,616 --> 00:34:34,976
Speaker 0: then she can do magic Because occasionally with this staff.

593
00:34:35,318 --> 00:34:35,539
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

594
00:34:36,342 --> 00:34:41,679
Speaker 0: And then in season two it's so let's see what the deal is with this staff, right?

595
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:45,449
Speaker 1: but the thing is it feels like the way it's structured it.

596
00:34:46,612 --> 00:34:52,018
Speaker 1: it feels like that they like they Explain the things from season one at the end of season two.

597
00:34:52,641 --> 00:34:56,060
Speaker 1: But it feels like they wrote that they didn't write that from the beginning, right?

598
00:34:56,201 --> 00:35:05,680
Speaker 1: It feels like they came up with that later like hmm I know we can tie these things together with this right because there was no foreshadowing of those particular things in advance.

599
00:35:06,544 --> 00:35:07,247
Speaker 1: You see what I'm saying?

600
00:35:07,287 --> 00:35:08,453
Speaker 1: Yeah, it just it.

601
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:09,900
Speaker 1: just I don't know if that's true or not.

602
00:35:10,181 --> 00:35:13,771
Speaker 1: But the way that the show is presented it feels that way.

603
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:26,729
Speaker 1: it feels like they did a thing and then they came up with new ideas and tossed him in and and then managed to use those new ideas that they just came up with to Explain the old things to tie it together in post-hoc.

604
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:30,760
Speaker 1: We're as opposed to coming up with 24 episodes that are cohesive.

605
00:35:31,561 --> 00:35:32,364
Speaker 0: Yeah, well cuz really.

606
00:35:32,384 --> 00:35:37,463
Speaker 0: it was just like one of the episodes was just let's go into Susie's like poison-filled brain and see what's Going on.

607
00:35:37,503 --> 00:35:38,891
Speaker 1: Well, you gotta have that kind of episode.

608
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:40,360
Speaker 1: Calvary Bebop had a mushroom episode.

609
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,068
Speaker 0: Yeah, we gotta have a mushroom episode.

610
00:35:42,109 --> 00:35:42,832
Speaker 1: mushroom episode.

611
00:35:42,872 --> 00:35:46,185
Speaker 1: There's the episode where it's just like Dragon stock dealing.

612
00:35:46,205 --> 00:35:47,952
Speaker 1: guys, you know stock guy.

613
00:35:47,973 --> 00:35:49,117
Speaker 1: It's like that episode was awesome.

614
00:35:49,137 --> 00:35:49,720
Speaker 1: Nothing wrong with it.

615
00:35:49,921 --> 00:35:51,210
Speaker 1: You can toss those in one thing.

616
00:35:51,230 --> 00:36:01,359
Speaker 0: I'm very happy about is that The show could have ruined itself if it really focused on the romance or relationships And instead it hinted at them.

617
00:36:01,921 --> 00:36:07,917
Speaker 0: But it basically gave equal pull between ako and this one guy character who's pretty good.

618
00:36:07,977 --> 00:36:08,920
Speaker 0: I like that character a lot.

619
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:11,655
Speaker 1: Yeah, he started off as being like, oh, here's the guy character.

620
00:36:11,675 --> 00:36:12,480
Speaker 1: It's like oh, no, he's alright.

621
00:36:12,621 --> 00:36:15,198
Speaker 0: Well, cuz he wasn't exactly as he appeared to be.

622
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,986
Speaker 1: no No, he was very cool.

623
00:36:17,287 --> 00:36:23,410
Speaker 0: it equally pulls toward ako having a relationship with Diana Mm-hmm, and it does not commit to either.

624
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:26,240
Speaker 0: Nope, which was just an interesting choice.

625
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:36,400
Speaker 0: I guess it was a good way to sort of keep they both like the phone both like shiny cherries Yep, but meanwhile, I did I think it 100% set up that Ursula and what's-her-name the Accio character?

626
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,973
Speaker 0: Definitely had a relationship.

627
00:36:39,053 --> 00:36:39,497
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

628
00:36:41,245 --> 00:36:42,993
Speaker 1: So that's another thing that you know.

629
00:36:43,033 --> 00:36:46,446
Speaker 1: bother me about the show is this is tension I guess spoil.

630
00:36:46,466 --> 00:36:47,350
Speaker 1: It's not a spoiler.

631
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're not gonna be like super spoilers right now.

632
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:55,160
Speaker 1: This is not a spoiler because like the audience knows this from the very beginning the show you're talking about Chekhov's gun.

633
00:36:55,261 --> 00:36:58,497
Speaker 0: It's Chekhov's look behind these glasses right at those red eyes.

634
00:36:58,557 --> 00:36:59,502
Speaker 1: So right It's like.

635
00:36:59,662 --> 00:37:09,020
Speaker 1: so so ako the main the central motivation of the main character Is that she wants to be like the superhero like which shiny chariot, right?

636
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,921
Speaker 1: Yep, and then her teacher is shiny chariot, but no one knows that just except you the audience except the audience knows it Right.

637
00:37:15,282 --> 00:37:19,876
Speaker 1: and the whole show is like you keep getting closer and closer to like.

638
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:20,940
Speaker 1: oh, she's gonna have to talk.

639
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,224
Speaker 1: Oh, she's Johnny chariot is.

640
00:37:22,264 --> 00:37:25,714
Speaker 1: she has to tell right and it's like it's.

641
00:37:26,055 --> 00:37:29,499
Speaker 1: I hate that trope so much Where it's like just fucking saying.

642
00:37:31,201 --> 00:37:31,523
Speaker 1: It's like.

643
00:37:31,644 --> 00:37:35,080
Speaker 1: I hate it when they don't just fucking say I want to see the show where they just fucking say.

644
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:42,872
Speaker 0: But at the same time and that this is not that show the show did not make the like the central point B. Oh, no, she'll find out.

645
00:37:43,114 --> 00:37:43,778
Speaker 0: No, not at all.

646
00:37:45,121 --> 00:37:45,723
Speaker 1: It's not that.

647
00:37:45,844 --> 00:37:50,160
Speaker 1: it's not that something bad will happen when she finds out or it's it's it's you know.

648
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:50,924
Speaker 0: It's much more.

649
00:37:51,085 --> 00:37:55,566
Speaker 0: how will she find out like you daughter dear or I daughter Do you really want to meet your heroes?

650
00:37:55,667 --> 00:38:04,200
Speaker 0: Cuz you when you find out when the show turns dark is when you find out What the sort of the implied story of why won't she tell her?

651
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,804
Speaker 0: Why is she this teacher.

652
00:38:05,945 --> 00:38:07,250
Speaker 0: and why is everything different?

653
00:38:07,531 --> 00:38:08,514
Speaker 0: and why is Matt?

654
00:38:08,655 --> 00:38:15,700
Speaker 0: because there's this whole like Environmental and implied story in the first half that magic is basically dying or dead, right?

655
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:19,560
Speaker 1: That is actually something that wasn't super resolved, right?

656
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,627
Speaker 1: I thought that's what was going to be resolved.

657
00:38:21,687 --> 00:38:25,180
Speaker 1: is that so the witches used to be able to magic all over the fucking place?

658
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:30,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, and now there's only magic like near the philosophers or sorcerers.

659
00:38:30,581 --> 00:38:41,117
Speaker 1: There's a great episode with the the fairies and their Union about their use of the magic and there's like a fault line In the earth that has like magic flowing in it and they could only do magic near it.

660
00:38:41,157 --> 00:38:42,905
Speaker 1: and if they go to town they Can't magic so much.

661
00:38:42,925 --> 00:38:45,800
Speaker 1: They got to bring some magic with them in a magic battery or something.

662
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:51,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's like so they somewhat resolve that a little bit but not.

663
00:38:52,321 --> 00:38:56,400
Speaker 0: They sort of imply that that's gonna be the plot and there's gonna be a particular kind of resolution.

664
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,987
Speaker 0: You'll probably be watching it and sort of say that

665
00:38:58,027 --> 00:39:09,520
Speaker 1: that's sort of like it looks like from from the first early Episodes that that is going to be the terrible secret that is resolved at the very end and it only sorta is the focus at The end is actually completely different.

666
00:39:09,661 --> 00:39:20,710
Speaker 0: I mean you expect it to be this idea of oh, yeah people like shiny chariot You need people to do inspire people to care about magic and that will make magic better and it's actually much more Dark and specific than that.

667
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:25,812
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not that super generic plot But I do like the fact that the plot is like.

668
00:39:26,053 --> 00:39:32,200
Speaker 0: all those questions are not dealt with in depth Because I don't want a show like this to focus on its stupid world building.

669
00:39:32,482 --> 00:39:35,680
Speaker 0: No, that is the least interesting part of this show is the world building.

670
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:44,914
Speaker 1: It's actually kind of cool how it's in the modern world and they tie together The modern world and also the magic the siloed away school world.

671
00:39:45,055 --> 00:39:46,740
Speaker 1: Yeah without sort of being ridiculous, right?

672
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:49,740
Speaker 1: It's like okay like magic exists and no one really gives a shit.

673
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:56,387
Speaker 1: It's like they happen to be near this town that looks really old and it's like yeah, there's still towns like that in Europe Exist and there's people.

674
00:39:56,427 --> 00:40:03,578
Speaker 1: the people in the town are totally modern buying, you know There's like a book series is being written that people are fans of and that the soccer riots.

675
00:40:03,658 --> 00:40:11,240
Speaker 0: really I Really like the soccer riot part a lot because it edges into Nico riot territory like old Byzantium style, right?

676
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,106
Speaker 1: But it's like they.

677
00:40:12,186 --> 00:40:23,730
Speaker 1: the way they like start, you know it starts and like flows in and connects actually kind of works right between the characters who are like connected to the government and Well, it's the opposite of town.

678
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:28,333
Speaker 0: and then because they're not named country they're in because the other ways to go with that are.

679
00:40:28,373 --> 00:40:33,313
Speaker 0: they're the shows that Set themselves in an old time and never connect themselves to a reference point.

680
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:33,695
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

681
00:40:33,936 --> 00:40:38,314
Speaker 0: Just to not worry about it There's shows like you Tena that are just sent in a modern time.

682
00:40:38,355 --> 00:40:39,480
Speaker 0: Like it's just normal world.

683
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,185
Speaker 1: It is a lot like a tenant, but

684
00:40:41,726 --> 00:40:41,927
Speaker 0: some

685
00:40:41,947 --> 00:40:44,534
Speaker 1: weird hidden away school, but it's totally the 90s,

686
00:40:44,715 --> 00:40:59,220
Speaker 0: but the difference is your tenet totally Isolates you the viewer from the outside world and it's a jarring Shock that is used to great effect when you are outside and you're sort of reminded of how crazy what's going on inside the school.

687
00:41:00,981 --> 00:41:06,295
Speaker 1: It's like no, they could just be in town with cars and cell phones But actually they just went to magic school because they wanted to yep.

688
00:41:07,562 --> 00:41:11,657
Speaker 0: So I'm real hard-pressed to decide if Suzy or Akka are actually my favorite character.

689
00:41:12,259 --> 00:41:23,663
Speaker 0: Mmm I like Suzy because she is dangerous like really dangerous and I can't and I imagine that other students have died because of her Hakko's loud.

690
00:41:24,185 --> 00:41:29,059
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is I tend to like the crazy side characters a lot.

691
00:41:29,721 --> 00:41:31,145
Speaker 0: So like the gang of.

692
00:41:31,306 --> 00:41:43,299
Speaker 0: well, you've always liked anime that have a gang of sort of side characters but who are like like next to the main characters who have that sort of Group dynamic of craziness in the background whenever they show up.

693
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:48,640
Speaker 0: Mmm, like all the all the half all the people who like come into the background and Pat LeBor and tank police.

694
00:41:49,062 --> 00:41:51,320
Speaker 1: It's like I like, you know, like the teachers for example, right?

695
00:41:51,420 --> 00:42:02,894
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know like especially the the crazy old teachers like haha potions Or like the fish the teacher who's just a fish yep in a bucket the whole fish.

696
00:42:03,295 --> 00:42:07,009
Speaker 0: the show is legit funny Yeah, and it doesn't.

697
00:42:07,029 --> 00:42:09,700
Speaker 1: there's a whole episode about the teacher who's just a fish in a bucket.

698
00:42:09,941 --> 00:42:12,494
Speaker 0: Yep, I also again because it's triggered.

699
00:42:12,514 --> 00:42:17,672
Speaker 0: the animation is fantastic Yeah, like Netflix money, right and it definitely has a theme of like.

700
00:42:18,133 --> 00:42:20,400
Speaker 0: Akko in particular will transform into things a lot.

701
00:42:20,842 --> 00:42:28,372
Speaker 0: It is used to ridiculous comedic effect on a episode by episode Basis and just when you think they've run that joke out they do it again.

702
00:42:28,452 --> 00:42:29,295
Speaker 1: magic shop guy.

703
00:42:29,315 --> 00:42:31,889
Speaker 0: Oh my god I forgot about that guy.

704
00:42:31,969 --> 00:42:33,238
Speaker 1: Yeah magic shop guy.

705
00:42:33,278 --> 00:42:36,339
Speaker 0: Yep So, I mean, I don't really want to spoil anything.

706
00:42:36,641 --> 00:42:39,391
Speaker 0: There's no point in talking about like a deeper level to the show.

707
00:42:39,411 --> 00:42:41,620
Speaker 0: This is a must-watch anime.

708
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:42,985
Speaker 1: It's not a super deep show.

709
00:42:43,065 --> 00:42:48,585
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's like at worst B plus probably a - anime I mean in terms of.

710
00:42:48,605 --> 00:42:50,493
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess let's see.

711
00:42:50,533 --> 00:42:52,119
Speaker 1: What's an anime better than this?

712
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,209
Speaker 1: I guess a lot of em had better than this an anime.

713
00:42:54,249 --> 00:42:56,179
Speaker 1: That's one step under this.

714
00:42:56,661 --> 00:42:58,428
Speaker 0: So here's a comparison because we talked.

715
00:42:58,448 --> 00:43:03,585
Speaker 0: we've mentioned occasionally my old Scott I magic users clubs better than Maha Until little witch academia.

716
00:43:04,086 --> 00:43:16,523
Speaker 0: that was our go-to cute witch show and I love the hell out of that OAV, but that OAV as Heartwarming well-constructed and cute as it was also had its problematic anime bullshit moments Particularly.

717
00:43:16,563 --> 00:43:18,330
Speaker 1: the first episode is definitely better than Maha.

718
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:18,732
Speaker 0: It's a guy.

719
00:43:19,073 --> 00:43:25,771
Speaker 0: Yeah, but most guys I was a pretty solid show Has a way better than I like El Hazard.

720
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:27,576
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's real good.

721
00:43:27,596 --> 00:43:28,900
Speaker 0: I'm gonna say it's nay anime.

722
00:43:29,061 --> 00:43:32,643
Speaker 1: I mean if you guys if you're an anime watcher in the year 2018 That's the anime to watch.

723
00:43:32,723 --> 00:43:38,860
Speaker 0: if you want many if you want to experience or get someone else to experience the craziness of studio trigger.

724
00:43:39,022 --> 00:43:40,214
Speaker 1: I think it's better than kill la kill.

725
00:43:40,235 --> 00:43:49,325
Speaker 0: awesome and The person you're not the kind of person or the person you're trying to get to enjoy trigger is not the kind of person who could Appreciate kill la kill.

726
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:52,718
Speaker 0: because kill la kill which I think is a better show.

727
00:43:52,758 --> 00:43:53,864
Speaker 0: the little witch I don't.

728
00:43:53,924 --> 00:44:00,276
Speaker 1: I think kill la kill started out maybe stronger in the early parts But then it sort of gets ridiculous and sort of off the chain.

729
00:44:00,336 --> 00:44:01,160
Speaker 1: I mean off the chain.

730
00:44:01,381 --> 00:44:02,365
Speaker 1: It's supposed to get off the chain.

731
00:44:02,385 --> 00:44:03,087
Speaker 1: That's what it's about.

732
00:44:03,529 --> 00:44:06,199
Speaker 1: But the plot just sort of goes all over the place towards the end.

733
00:44:06,841 --> 00:44:14,920
Speaker 1: Right, whereas I think little witch academia even as I said, it was uncohesive before I think is more cohesive I wouldn't say the end of kill la kill goes all goes all over the place.

734
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:18,777
