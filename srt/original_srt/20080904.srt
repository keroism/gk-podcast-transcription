00:00:30,943 --> 00:00:35,120
Speaker 1: So the last show we're all bragging about the fact that we are not shit talkers.

7
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,288
Speaker 1: We said we go to PAX no matter what.

Speaker 1: talking you ready.

13
00:00:58,278 --> 00:01:02,677
Speaker 1: we said We said that this Thursday show would be the snow crash show.

14
00:01:02,757 --> 00:01:04,721
Speaker 0: you said Ambivalent.

15
00:01:04,983 --> 00:01:05,605
Speaker 1: it is not.

16
00:01:05,725 --> 00:01:07,671
Speaker 1: it is not the snow crash the snow crash.

17
00:01:07,691 --> 00:01:09,778
Speaker 1: She'll be one week from today.

18
00:01:09,798 --> 00:01:17,260
Speaker 0: granted I'll admit sadly as much as I love snow crash I'm not that excited about doing a snow crash show because of how few of you actually read the book.

19
00:01:17,882 --> 00:01:22,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I have to actually skim the book a little bit to refresh the memories and get the jet.

20
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,705
Speaker 1: I think once I do that.

21
00:01:24,067 --> 00:01:25,997
Speaker 1: I'll be more excited to do the snow crash show.

22
00:01:26,137 --> 00:01:26,539
Speaker 0: We'll see.

23
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:27,562
Speaker 0: I the only.

24
00:01:27,944 --> 00:01:39,462
Speaker 0: basically I'll say this if you guys actually want the snow crash show tell us because so far people seem to not Actually in any way care about the geek nights book club, and we're getting like a 1% return right here I've got.

25
00:01:39,543 --> 00:01:40,788
Speaker 1: actually here's my idea right.

26
00:01:40,808 --> 00:01:44,804
Speaker 1: we're gonna do the snow crash show and of course in the snow crash show We will announce the next book.

27
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:49,940
Speaker 1: I have an idea for the next book, and it's a really easy book.

28
00:01:50,502 --> 00:01:51,406
Speaker 0: Is it gonna be?

29
00:01:51,506 --> 00:01:52,269
Speaker 0: I can think of a few.

30
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:52,972
Speaker 0: the little prince?

31
00:01:53,293 --> 00:01:54,900
Speaker 1: no no no it's not that easy.

32
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,467
Speaker 1: It's not see spot run.

33
00:01:56,487 --> 00:01:56,768
Speaker 1: all right.

34
00:01:56,808 --> 00:01:59,761
Speaker 1: It's a worthwhile book, but it's easy wait wait Wait.

35
00:01:59,782 --> 00:02:01,640
Speaker 0: are you saying the little prince is not worthwhile?

36
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,475
Speaker 1: I'm didn't say the little prince wasn't worthwhile, but the little prince is not not see spot run.

37
00:02:06,495 --> 00:02:10,440
Speaker 1: comparing it to see spot run here No, I'm saying the little prince of my favorite books ever.

38
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,153
Speaker 1: But this book we're gonna do is slightly harder than the little prince.

39
00:02:14,554 --> 00:02:18,231
Speaker 1: not that easy all right It's all right.

40
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:19,242
Speaker 1: It'll be okay It'll take.

41
00:02:19,262 --> 00:02:22,160
Speaker 1: I can read the book in a day.

42
00:02:22,461 --> 00:02:27,843
Speaker 0: That doesn't say much cuz I read the prince of nothing in like a week and apparently that's the thing is I figure Right.

43
00:02:27,863 --> 00:02:31,194
Speaker 1: I read these books in a week and other people have take a month.

44
00:02:31,355 --> 00:02:35,479
Speaker 1: if I can read it in a day Maybe the people can read it in two weeks.

45
00:02:36,082 --> 00:02:47,963
Speaker 1: Maybe we'll see all right, and then if that doesn't work maybe we'll either Really shame everyone who didn't read and call you out for being doofuses or something I don't know.

46
00:02:47,983 --> 00:02:51,260
Speaker 0: Maybe I like kind of like doofy even though it's incorrect.

47
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:58,928
Speaker 0: I know doofuses is kind of like that whole argument about how they they're gonna pluralize Paxis Paxis even though that like hurts my ears to hear.

48
00:02:58,948 --> 00:03:00,653
Speaker 1: yeah well paces.

49
00:03:00,954 --> 00:03:02,397
Speaker 0: Yeah much cooler all right.

50
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,647
Speaker 1: anyway Do we want to do news or not?

51
00:03:06,008 --> 00:03:08,680
Speaker 1: I have a news that can stir some discussion even though it's pretty old.

52
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,783
Speaker 0: I've got three bags news.

53
00:03:09,803 --> 00:03:10,265

Speaker 0: I don't even know why I own them.

66
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:36,687
Speaker 0: They're in the kitchen.

67
00:03:36,707 --> 00:03:39,940
Speaker 1: I guess they were emergency like an emergency lasagna or something.

68
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:43,799
Speaker 0: Oh, God actually I saw the emergency lasagna, and I threw it away.

69
00:03:44,823 --> 00:03:46,087
Speaker 0: It was frightening looking.

70
00:03:46,749 --> 00:03:47,551
Speaker 1: It's pretty scary.

71
00:03:47,691 --> 00:03:59,797
Speaker 0: No I ate third tier ramen Third tier as in top ramen top ramen That's the third tier fourth tier being March on why don't we have separate itchy bones?

72
00:03:59,877 --> 00:04:01,704
Speaker 0: I ate it all I did.

73
00:04:01,724 --> 00:04:05,217
Speaker 0: I had a ramen, but I ate it where the kitchen is.

74
00:04:05,337 --> 00:04:05,859
Speaker 1: I ate them.

75
00:04:07,521 --> 00:04:08,123
Speaker 1: Are they yummy?

76
00:04:08,243 --> 00:04:08,524
Speaker 1: I did.

77
00:04:08,544 --> 00:04:11,674
Speaker 1: you grow them on the stick over the fire the little spinny steak or what?

78
00:04:12,276 --> 00:04:13,380
Speaker 1: I don't know what?

79
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:19,920
Speaker 0: Whatever, I see where you're going with that, but if measure is unceasing that joke is dead right anyway.

80
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,166
Speaker 1: So check this out right.

81
00:04:22,227 --> 00:04:23,190
Speaker 1: This is a little old.

82
00:04:23,251 --> 00:04:24,737
Speaker 1: This is from like a week or two ago.

83
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:25,500
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

84
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:34,748
Speaker 1: That's like ancient some august 26th right, but I don't think we discussed it on this show even though It was actually discussed in so semi mainstream medium.

85
00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:39,280
Speaker 1: anyway in Connecticut right there was a kid named Jericho Scott.

86
00:04:39,742 --> 00:04:40,004
Speaker 1: Right.

87
00:04:40,044 --> 00:04:40,989
Speaker 1: Scott was his last name.

88
00:04:41,391 --> 00:04:45,528
Speaker 1: He's nine years old Okay, and he's in a little league.

89
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,833
Speaker 1: Did you hear the story yet?

90
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:47,174
Speaker 0: No.

91
00:04:47,214 --> 00:04:48,820
Speaker 0: I have no idea what you're tall this story.

92
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,265
Speaker 1: He's going to infuriate you.

93
00:04:50,325 --> 00:04:51,047
Speaker 1: I'm so glad.

94
00:04:51,068 --> 00:04:51,469
Speaker 0: wait a minute.

95
00:04:51,489 --> 00:04:51,910
Speaker 0: wait a minute.

96
00:04:52,051 --> 00:04:53,977
Speaker 0: this involves helicopter parents.

97
00:04:54,018 --> 00:04:58,754
Speaker 0: I'm going to guess possibly Religion and or a closed-minded town.

98
00:04:58,935 --> 00:05:07,794
Speaker 1: no religion Not really a town that's closed-minded helicopter parents though perhaps Helicoptering it could be easily interpreted as helicopter parents.

99
00:05:07,814 --> 00:05:09,120
Speaker 0: Maybe maybe some coddling.

100
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,087
Speaker 1: Definitely coddling.

101
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:11,972
Speaker 1: so what's going on?

102
00:05:12,013 --> 00:05:13,140
Speaker 1: the situation was this?

103
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:21,820
Speaker 1: Jericho Scott this nine-year-old kid can throw a 40 mile an hour fastball right over the plate every time.

104
00:05:22,181 --> 00:05:23,145
Speaker 1: He's pretty awesome.

105
00:05:23,185 --> 00:05:24,792
Speaker 1: Whoa right you know.

106
00:05:24,852 --> 00:05:26,760
Speaker 1: and this this kids like this all the time.

107
00:05:26,881 --> 00:05:28,028
Speaker 0: I can't be good for him.

108
00:05:28,068 --> 00:05:29,397
Speaker 0: pitching's not good for you.

109
00:05:29,438 --> 00:05:33,100
Speaker 1: Let alone You know in kids who are like this in a little league?

110
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,311
Speaker 1: You know maybe they win the little league world series.

111
00:05:35,694 --> 00:05:36,639
Speaker 1: who in the who's won?

112
00:05:37,161 --> 00:05:39,940
Speaker 1: Where the big major league stars that were big little leaguers?

113
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:40,723
Speaker 1: They don't exist.

114
00:05:41,265 --> 00:05:44,097
Speaker 1: you know it's major league players the people who developed.

115
00:05:44,358 --> 00:05:44,599
Speaker 1: you know.

116
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,880
Speaker 1: later This kid's probably going to throw a 40 mile an hour fastball his whole life.

117
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,260
Speaker 1: He's never going to really throw a 90 mile an hour ball.

118
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,796
Speaker 0: I don't think I could have thrown a 40 mile an hour fastball.

119
00:05:53,078 --> 00:05:54,022
Speaker 1: now It's really.

120
00:05:54,083 --> 00:06:03,300
Speaker 1: it's all in the wrist like when I was at summer camp once they had a scout come and teach the kids How to throw and stuff and I actually paid attention because I was older and wiser by that time.

121
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:11,400
Speaker 1: I was a counselor not a not a camper, and you know I could throw But I could never you know throw hard and the guy was like look here's the technique.

122
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:12,947
Speaker 1: And I basically tried it like a whole.

123
00:06:12,987 --> 00:06:20,256
Speaker 1: I just played catch of this dude like for like you know 10 minutes And at first it was just like eh, eh, and then eventually it was like.

124
00:06:20,577 --> 00:06:21,420
Speaker 1: you know where it's like.

125
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:32,300
Speaker 0: And I'm like oh Well you can only because I was trying to throw kids who play catch with their parents or brothers kids who don't because the kids Who know how to throw can actually make it back to home base from at least second base?

126
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,643
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean It's like you don't.

127
00:06:33,683 --> 00:06:38,920
Speaker 1: the trick is actually like a trick to throwing a baseball where you snap your wrist and such.

128
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:42,737
Speaker 0: I was doing slow permanent damage to your body, but well it depends.

129
00:06:42,798 --> 00:06:54,109
Speaker 1: not pitching But just throwing like field throwing you know not damaging your body And you know it doesn't take that long to learn if you have you know adequate motor skills And it's really fun once you figure it out.

130
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:54,871
Speaker 1: It's like oh shit.

131
00:06:54,931 --> 00:07:16,515
Speaker 1: I can throw hard awesome anyway, so Alright, this kid exists and what happened was his team was eight and oh of course Right eight games one no games lost and they are preparing for the playoffs And they went up and they were gonna play this game and the other team just forfeited.

132
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:25,680
Speaker 1: right all right The team was like oh shit They tried to take the mound and the other team quit because they were they were afraid I'd first off that other team.

133
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:31,520
Speaker 0: Totally lame however was however while they are wusses and while I?

134
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:38,591
Speaker 0: Can say one thing at back in quiz bowl because we were kind of the bad boys of quiz bowl And we were like we were pretty good, but a lot of times.

135
00:07:38,611 --> 00:07:40,400
Speaker 0: We would lose on purpose just to go dick around.

136
00:07:41,363 --> 00:07:43,155
Speaker 0: We would we sometimes like?

137
00:07:43,256 --> 00:07:51,354
Speaker 0: a couple of times We actually like use rules or had someone stay in the bathroom too long to force a forfeit Just because our coach couldn't accuse us of quitting.

138
00:07:51,374 --> 00:07:54,077
Speaker 1: yeah, so What happened next?

139
00:07:54,157 --> 00:07:54,380
Speaker 1: well?

140
00:07:55,521 --> 00:07:58,328
Speaker 1: They told the kid he couldn't play.

141
00:07:58,348 --> 00:08:02,519
Speaker 0: well wait a minute right and who told the kid he couldn't?

142
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:05,178
Speaker 0: the league What grounds?

143
00:08:06,181 --> 00:08:07,472
Speaker 1: And grounds that you know.

144
00:08:07,532 --> 00:08:08,480
Speaker 1: no one to play against him.

145
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,916
Speaker 1: And they were afraid right and then wait the team coach refused to break up the team.

146
00:08:13,956 --> 00:08:16,925
Speaker 1: so basically yeah The team isn't gonna play.

147
00:08:16,965 --> 00:08:18,129
Speaker 1: the team coach for the win.

148
00:08:18,189 --> 00:08:20,977
Speaker 1: the team is banned from the league and it and the.

149
00:08:21,097 --> 00:08:23,246
Speaker 1: the coach says He's never heard anyone.

150
00:08:23,346 --> 00:08:24,592
Speaker 1: He's on target all the time.

151
00:08:24,692 --> 00:08:26,299
Speaker 1: How can you punish him for being too good?

152
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,004
Speaker 1: Said the pitcher.

153
00:08:28,144 --> 00:08:30,315
Speaker 1: the kid says I feel sad.

154
00:08:30,335 --> 00:08:31,440
Speaker 1: I feel like it's my fault.

155
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,443
Speaker 1: No one can play.

156
00:08:33,065 --> 00:08:37,217
Speaker 1: the league says he's a very skilled player a very hard thrower.

157
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:42,091
Speaker 1: the league attorney Says there are a lot of beginners is not a high-powered league.

158
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:45,340
Speaker 1: It's a developmental league whose main purpose is to promote the sport.

159
00:08:46,421 --> 00:08:48,087
Speaker 1: So basically they kick the team out.

160
00:08:48,108 --> 00:08:49,553
Speaker 0: What kind of league was this then?

161
00:08:49,754 --> 00:08:50,577
Speaker 0: little league like?

162
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:51,380
Speaker 0: what kind of little league?

163
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,180
Speaker 1: There's a lot of the youth baseball league of New Haven, Connecticut.

164
00:08:54,683 --> 00:08:56,455
Speaker 0: So publicly funded I don't know.

165
00:08:56,576 --> 00:08:57,140
Speaker 0: I'm just curious.

166
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,325
Speaker 0: I Don't know about that.

167
00:09:00,646 --> 00:09:01,589
Speaker 1: that does make a difference.

168
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:03,998
Speaker 1: I didn't think of that angle before I was funneled once.

169
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:06,773
Speaker 1: yeah I didn't I didn't think of that angle, but you know.

170
00:09:06,873 --> 00:09:09,086
Speaker 1: the thing is I'm gonna repeat What was said on.

171
00:09:09,187 --> 00:09:11,018
Speaker 1: you know the ESPN show PTI?

172
00:09:12,101 --> 00:09:12,362
Speaker 0: I can.

173
00:09:12,523 --> 00:09:15,171
Speaker 0: I can sum up everything I feel about this in two words.

174
00:09:15,452 --> 00:09:17,098
Speaker 0: hmm Harrison Bergeron?

175
00:09:17,258 --> 00:09:22,734
Speaker 1: exactly No, but on PTI right the the sports show I listen to.

176
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,332
Speaker 1: you know it's a TV show But I listen to the podcast.

177
00:09:25,413 --> 00:09:25,858
Speaker 1: you should too.

178
00:09:27,203 --> 00:09:28,028
Speaker 1: The guy was like.

179
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,724
Speaker 1: he told the story out when he was a kid And he was in the league.

180
00:09:30,965 --> 00:09:34,320
Speaker 1: there was one pitcher on one team who is wicked dangerous.

181
00:09:34,481 --> 00:09:39,400
Speaker 1: He was always afraid of him, but eventually he got over it, and he actually hit off the guy.

182
00:09:39,561 --> 00:09:56,628
Speaker 1: he was like oh yeah, oh yeah, and You're taking away that you know valuable youth experience from the kids of having to go up and hit against this Terrifyingly good pitcher and getting over it instead you know sort of the the wasifying No child left behind.

183
00:09:56,669 --> 00:09:57,858
Speaker 1: Harrison Bergeron action.

184
00:10:00,722 --> 00:10:01,324
Speaker 0: Case in point.

185
00:10:01,344 --> 00:10:05,840
Speaker 0: if anyone here is not read Harrison Bergeron read it into the quiet required.

186
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:12,999
Speaker 1: Okay, if you can't read a book all right you can at least read Harrison Bergeron, and if you can't read Harrison Bergeron There's a movie.

187
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,365
Speaker 0: It's actually a really good movie.

188
00:10:14,385 --> 00:10:18,903
Speaker 1: can watch the movie and if you can't even watch the movie you can read the last question.

189
00:10:19,204 --> 00:10:34,170
Speaker 0: at least I can say one thing Harrison Bergeron the movie is Very much like V for Vendetta Like it's kind of like the movie to the book is the same difference like V for Vendetta versus No, Harrison Bergeron's a short story kids.

190
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:35,234
Speaker 1: You can read it.

191
00:10:35,675 --> 00:10:37,100
Speaker 1: They probably make you read it in school.

192
00:10:37,161 --> 00:10:38,758
Speaker 1: They made me read it in school three times.

193
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:45,540
Speaker 0: All right, all right, so uh as many of you know I hail from the land of Detroit, Michigan.

194
00:10:45,681 --> 00:10:48,459
Speaker 1: I was born Detroit, which we saw from the sky.

195
00:10:49,022 --> 00:10:53,220
Speaker 0: Yes from the sky and Scott pointed out that and we look out the window.

196
00:10:53,622 --> 00:10:59,529
Speaker 0: It's basically a giant lighted grid of roads with like two Diagonal roads going across the whole thing.

197
00:10:59,891 --> 00:11:01,840
Speaker 1: there are also some angled roads near the edge.

198
00:11:02,121 --> 00:11:03,647
Speaker 0: Well near the edge because the water's there.

199
00:11:03,688 --> 00:11:06,459
Speaker 0: so the grid kind of turns to follow the road go right.

200
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,239
Speaker 1: it Just you know extend the roads out into the water with little bridges that there's still a grid

201
00:11:10,783 --> 00:11:16,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, and still the thing is if you go away from the water It's just a perfect grid all the way down into like Ohio and Wisconsin all the way crossing to Canada.

202
00:11:17,422 --> 00:11:22,199
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah, but anyway Detroit is a is a is an interesting place.

203
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:30,245
Speaker 0: now I point out that the only people who say Detroit are people who are not from Detroit or People on the radio.

204
00:11:30,265 --> 00:11:30,626
Speaker 0: It's weird.

205
00:11:30,646 --> 00:11:37,028
Speaker 0: like a lot of radio personalities in Detroit will say Detroit, Michigan But everyone who lives in Detroit.

206
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:43,425
Speaker 0: We just say Detroit Detroit or Detroit Just more of a day day.

207
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:47,837
Speaker 0: that's why Detroit, but of course there's always salt st.

208
00:11:47,937 --> 00:11:48,919
Speaker 0: Mary up on top.

209
00:11:49,863 --> 00:11:52,164
Speaker 0: anyway Detroit.

210
00:11:52,284 --> 00:12:02,226
Speaker 0: I have a love-hate relationship with the city of Detroit because on one hand Detroit is a really cool place, and there's a lot of cool architecture, and it's one of those Really important cities.

211
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:12,500
Speaker 1: it was a world city a global city that fell into decline when in industry and all these sorts It's sad to see anything awesome become less awesome like it's like the World's Fair in New York only a lot bigger.

212
00:12:12,561 --> 00:12:16,439
Speaker 1: It's like oh, man, but now It's just a. it's just a park.

213
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:31,397
Speaker 0: But one thing I can say about Detroit is that the politics of Detroit which are a microcosm In many ways of the politics of Michigan as a whole well They're you know look at the ancestors of modern Detroit politics Al Capone right.

214
00:12:31,457 --> 00:12:33,622
Speaker 1: That's the ancestor Scott.

215
00:12:34,184 --> 00:12:35,970
Speaker 0: where was Al Capone based?

216
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:37,355
Speaker 0: Chicago, okay?

217
00:12:37,616 --> 00:12:38,739
Speaker 1: Yeah, Detroit was close.

218
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,153
Speaker 0: Okay, yeah, there are better people to make fun of for Detroit.

219
00:12:44,194 --> 00:12:46,000
Speaker 0: There's a notorious Detroit Turian's.

220
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,289
Speaker 1: Anyway, Al Capone owned a mall.

221
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:50,434
Speaker 0: I'll come on.

222
00:12:50,454 --> 00:12:51,539
Speaker 0: wasn't even that good?

223
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:54,728
Speaker 0: Ma Baker's the way to go.

224
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,618
Speaker 1: It's all about a Capone's vault.

225
00:12:57,731 --> 00:13:01,226
Speaker 1: I Wait in Detroit gold.

226
00:13:01,306 --> 00:13:03,963
Speaker 0: Are you making a Geraldo joke?

227
00:13:04,545 --> 00:13:09,980
Speaker 0: what on geek nights you realize the whole Al Capone vault thing came out of Geraldo Rivera.

228
00:13:10,701 --> 00:13:11,482
Speaker 1: I don't know what that is.

229
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:13,425
Speaker 1: all I know is that it was some weird TV special.

230
00:13:13,586 --> 00:13:15,208
Speaker 1: Yeah, they Geraldo Rivera.

231
00:13:15,389 --> 00:13:19,392
Speaker 0: He said I found Al Capone's vault.

232
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:20,974
Speaker 0: so he don't know what's in there.

233
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,517
Speaker 0: He built up to this business.

234
00:13:22,557 --> 00:13:23,979
Speaker 1: I'm over as a person.

235
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,747
Speaker 1: yes Okay, so it's just a guy.

236
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:29,196
Speaker 0: so finally the moment comes live TV.

237
00:13:29,216 --> 00:13:30,400
Speaker 0: this crazy build-up.

238
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:30,842
Speaker 1: They've got all.

239
00:13:30,862 --> 00:13:31,545
Speaker 1: any was empty.

240
00:13:31,786 --> 00:13:34,116
Speaker 0: There was like some dust in there and a cobweb.

241
00:13:34,136 --> 00:13:34,900
Speaker 0: Maybe a dead mouse.

242
00:13:35,162 --> 00:13:36,920
Speaker 1: I didn't stay up to see what was in there.

243
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,845
Speaker 0: But Michigan the only state in the Union to have a shooting war not a long one with another state Mr.. Rebellion the only state.

244
00:13:44,966 --> 00:13:45,689
Speaker 0: well not actually.

245
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:50,269
Speaker 0: I think Texas had it incident to where it's militia Independent Texas.

246
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:51,455
Speaker 1: that's an international war.

247
00:13:51,495 --> 00:13:58,300
Speaker 0: that's not a state Independent of any orders from the Union invaded Canada on at least one occasion.

248
00:13:58,321 --> 00:14:05,560
Speaker 0: Yeah They caused some mischief and eventually were pushed back over the border because the Mounties were actually very competent.

249
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,885
Speaker 0: Michigan militia not so much.

250
00:14:07,005 --> 00:14:07,266
Speaker 1: Well.

251
00:14:07,387 --> 00:14:11,100
Speaker 1: You know mounted units always beat non mounted units.

252
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,367
Speaker 1: This is this is a lot less.

253
00:14:12,387 --> 00:14:14,700
Speaker 1: They have pikes and there were no pikes.

254
00:14:14,781 --> 00:14:15,675
Speaker 1: They were just muskets.

255
00:14:16,341 --> 00:14:22,140
Speaker 1: But the thing is the other guys had muskets too, so it muskets on horses beat muskets not on horses.

256
00:14:22,602 --> 00:14:26,320
Speaker 0: But to skip a bit Detroit is that many shall we say colorful?

257
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,974
Speaker 0: Personalities in its political machine political machine that I think.

00:14:34,225 --> 00:14:38,319
Speaker 1: I go to Chicago you go all the way to New York all right, and you're yelling at me fuck you.

260
00:14:39,226 --> 00:14:40,278
Speaker 0: Anyway, here's the deal.

261

00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:32,754
Speaker 1: that was it.

304
00:17:33,962 --> 00:17:36,589
Speaker 1: It's calling brown the basketball player.

305
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:37,733
Speaker 1: No thing has been going on.

306
00:17:37,753 --> 00:17:40,140
Speaker 1: this may call me of Detroit, right?

307
00:17:41,081 --> 00:17:44,056
Speaker 1: How many corrupt things did he get away with before now?

308
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:44,700
Speaker 1: He's in jail.

309
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,259
Speaker 1: Why does it take so long in Detroit when in Connecticut took five minutes?

310
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,354
Speaker 0: Detroit you've never been to the store.

311
00:17:51,374 --> 00:17:54,668
Speaker 0: You've been to Novi Yep, you drove near Detroit.

312
00:17:54,688 --> 00:17:56,134
Speaker 0: You've never been in Detroit.

313
00:17:56,154 --> 00:17:57,640
Speaker 0: You've never lived in Detroit.

314
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:06,780
Speaker 0: All I have to say is I found this thing hilarious For as long as it's been happening, and I just wanted to point out that it finally came to its hilarious and bitter end.

315
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,747
Speaker 0: so things of the day.

316
00:18:15,787 --> 00:18:16,309
Speaker 0: from packs.

317
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:19,247
Speaker 1: I Can't help mines not from pegs.

318
00:18:19,347 --> 00:18:21,860
Speaker 0: mine is however because I was I was gonna do something else.

319
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,407
Speaker 0: I got a bunch of you know saved up things.

320
00:18:23,427 --> 00:18:24,914
Speaker 0: you can look in my delicious and find them.

321
00:18:24,934 --> 00:18:30,280
Speaker 0: if you're really desperate of course Then you'll just be very disappointed and some geek nights episode far in the future.

322
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,348
Speaker 0: But I mentioned that it packs.

323
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:38,280
Speaker 0: the audience was Rick rolled in perhaps the most epic Rick rolling I've ever seen and there's a YouTube video of this Rick rolling.

324
00:18:39,023 --> 00:18:39,525
Speaker 0: I pointed out.

325
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:43,140
Speaker 1: telling them that the videos are Rick rolling sort of ruins the effect of the video.

326
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:43,942
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't.

327
00:18:43,982 --> 00:18:45,747
Speaker 0: because you're gonna know it's a Rick rolling.

328
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:46,449
Speaker 0: you go to YouTube.

329
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:50,725
Speaker 0: It says packs 2008 - Jonathan Colton.

330
00:18:50,927 --> 00:18:52,099
Speaker 0: Rick rolls the audience.

331
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:57,399
Speaker 0: Well I guess that's Jonathan Colton tricks the audience into clicking on a suspicious link.

332
00:18:59,344 --> 00:19:00,135
Speaker 1: I fell for it.

333
00:19:00,804 --> 00:19:01,638
Speaker 0: We all fell for it.

334
00:19:01,678 --> 00:19:10,848
Speaker 0: now The reason I want you to watch this video is because if you didn't listen to our packs coverage because you're an idiot because any Human being could enjoy packs And you probably should want to listen joys.

335
00:19:10,868 --> 00:19:15,945
Speaker 1: geek nights would enjoy packs not any human being I thought my grandma would enjoy If you're my grandma would have.

336
00:19:16,165 --> 00:19:21,844
Speaker 0: if you're listening to this you probably either enjoy packs or someone is trying to Rick roll you with geek nights.

337
00:19:22,148 --> 00:19:27,636
Speaker 0: very nice, but Watch this video one to understand how epic this Rick rolling was.

338
00:19:27,676 --> 00:19:31,647
Speaker 0: but more importantly Listen to the way the crowd reacts.

339
00:19:31,908 --> 00:19:34,435
Speaker 0: the shifting volume really says it all.

340
00:19:34,676 --> 00:19:36,140
Speaker 1: yeah, that gives me an idea.

341
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:39,160
Speaker 1: Why don't we start a campaign of geek role where we say hey everyone?

342
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:50,439
Speaker 1: Go to forums and blogs and places and post comments that link to geek nights episodes and such But you make it look like you're linking a spore to or whatever it is you're deciding to Rick roll that day.

343
00:19:51,781 --> 00:20:02,088
Speaker 0: That's like saying hey go punch people in the face and then say geek night sent you Do it Alright, so what do you got?

344
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:07,618
Speaker 0: and I just want to point out before we go any further than everything I said about Mary Kwame Kilpatrick was taken from Wikipedia, and I hold no veracity to it.

345
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:08,060
Speaker 0: anyway.

346
00:20:08,381 --> 00:20:10,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right and call me Brown is a basketball player.

347
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,500
Speaker 1: Yes that I just got confused with Kwame Kilpatrick, okay?

348
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,607
Speaker 1: So Mary Blair, do you know Mary Blair is?

349
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:17,892
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

350
00:20:17,932 --> 00:20:19,056
Speaker 1: Mary Blair is the.

351
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:20,340
Speaker 1: it's a small world.

352
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:20,922
Speaker 1: Afterall.

353
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:21,624
Speaker 1: illustrator it.

354
00:20:22,366 --> 00:20:23,168
Speaker 1: once you see the art.

355
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:30,553
Speaker 1: You'll be like oh Alright, it is art where when I was a kid I did not appreciate and now that has been brought to my attention yet again.

356
00:20:30,954 --> 00:20:32,740
Speaker 1: I suddenly appreciate it times a billion.

357
00:20:32,861 --> 00:20:39,880
Speaker 1: I don't know why I don't know why but it's amazing and Basically this person on flicker made a small arc.

358
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,367
Speaker 1: I mean let me just read their little description of their set.

359
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:50,200
Speaker 1: their flicker set a Small archive of Mary Blair images I've culled from the internet including some from animation art dealers and auction sites.

360
00:20:51,361 --> 00:20:55,012
Speaker 1: I started saving the images because I had no clue if I would ever see them again.

361
00:20:55,193 --> 00:20:59,854
Speaker 1: once certain items were bought for private collections Collections I got hiccups or something.

362
00:20:59,894 --> 00:21:00,176
Speaker 1: I don't know.

363
00:21:01,102 --> 00:21:05,220
Speaker 1: You got some Alice in Wonderland, which I think is the best part of the collection here.

364
00:21:06,062 --> 00:21:07,947
Speaker 1: You got some Cinderella's.

365
00:21:07,988 --> 00:21:09,732
Speaker 1: you got some Sleeping Beauty's.

366
00:21:10,194 --> 00:21:12,119
Speaker 1: you got some just like greeting card shit.

367
00:21:12,861 --> 00:21:24,019
Speaker 1: It stuff is a pretty freaking awesome stuff here, and if you have any appreciation of Illustrations, and you know that sort of Disney arts you need to take a look at this.

368
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:26,599
Speaker 1: Yeah, I enjoyed it immensely.

369
00:21:27,163 --> 00:21:49,207
Speaker 1: memorize these funny place names Walla Walla Keokuk Kookamunga So Seattle that's one of my favorite Clips.

370
00:21:49,268 --> 00:21:51,184
Speaker 1: I've been hey I can't believe.

371
00:21:51,224 --> 00:22:01,312
Speaker 1: it's like I've been looking for that clip for a while not that I actually tried hard to search for it But as soon as we decided to put it in the show It just we found it on Hulu immediately, and it was the perfect clip exactly.

372
00:22:01,352 --> 00:22:17,086
Speaker 0: we were walking around Seattle the whole weekend going Seattle, nah, Seattle People were kind of looking at us, but yes geek nights rim and Scott the residents of the East Coast Went to that other coast.

373
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:18,470
Speaker 0: we went to Seattle.

374
00:22:18,891 --> 00:22:21,940
Speaker 0: it was the first time Scott had ever been west of Novi, Michigan.

375
00:22:22,786 --> 00:22:26,706
Speaker 0: It was the first time I had ever been west of Benson in Arizona.

376
00:22:26,906 --> 00:22:31,200
Speaker 0: yeah, no other than flying to Benson kind of not that long before packs.

377
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:32,386
Speaker 0: I'd only never.

378
00:22:32,427 --> 00:22:34,317
Speaker 0: I'd only been as wet far rest as Chicago.

379
00:22:34,377 --> 00:22:40,080
Speaker 1: up to that point I've decided I want to be Magellan and you know pass through every possible longitude.

380
00:22:41,042 --> 00:22:42,128
Speaker 0: Do you really yep?

381
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,120
Speaker 0: There's some longitudes that aren't that fun?

382
00:22:44,742 --> 00:22:48,738
Speaker 1: I know, but I just have to make it pretty much from Seattle to Israel.

383
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:52,697
Speaker 1: somehow I'm the other side of the world so flying to China will help a lot.

384
00:22:53,058 --> 00:22:56,989
Speaker 1: right That the hard part is gonna be between China and Israel.

385
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:59,036
Speaker 1: That's that's the hard longitudes to get.

386
00:22:59,537 --> 00:23:01,087
Speaker 1: maybe I can go to Perth Australia.

387
00:23:01,127 --> 00:23:02,036
Speaker 1: that would get pretty close.

388
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:04,667
Speaker 1: Anyway in India then Italy.

389
00:23:04,787 --> 00:23:05,189
Speaker 1: there we go.

390
00:23:05,871 --> 00:23:18,100
Speaker 0: if I go from Japan to Australia to India to Italy I'll have it covered all right, so you know because packs is so crazy and gigantic And we're gonna do like seven or eight shows about it at this point or things relating to it.

391
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:25,380
Speaker 0: Yes, we decided very pointedly to kind of excise out all of the not directly related to packs business.

392
00:23:25,521 --> 00:23:28,736
Speaker 0: So like when we tell the story of Otacon it's got to the point where we'll talk about.

393
00:23:28,756 --> 00:23:33,420
Speaker 0: you know stuff We did in Baltimore and all that kind of business and Katsu Khan and all these things.

394
00:23:34,233 --> 00:23:39,840
Speaker 0: Now We're gonna do a show kind of all the stuff that we did at packs that had nothing to do with packs.

395
00:23:40,101 --> 00:23:42,207
Speaker 1: Well most of it was eating at restaurants.

396
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:45,960
Speaker 0: I guess we'd call it a go west young men something like that.

397
00:23:46,261 --> 00:23:47,084
Speaker 0: Yes, first thing.

398
00:23:47,124 --> 00:23:53,168
Speaker 0: I want to say is that you know the Odyssey of us going to Seattle Began with jet blue, and you know we did.

399
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:57,104
Speaker 0: our business actually was kind of sad because Emily was gonna like see us off And she had to get for me at the.

400
00:23:57,124 --> 00:24:19,760
Speaker 0: but then we we caught the shuttle at like the perfectly wrong time And then we got to the jet blue terminal and JFK and only to discover that basically we're in line there's like 20 people in front of us to check bags and then the line stops moving for a while, and then we discover that the computers have crashed and One by one you see people around us get more and more panicked.

401
00:24:20,303 --> 00:24:23,300
Speaker 1: I'm just chilling cuz I'm like whatever I'm gonna get on my flight.

402
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,155
Speaker 1: You know this computer failure cannot possibly keep me from getting on the plane.

403
00:24:27,196 --> 00:24:29,343
Speaker 1: as long as the plane works This doesn't matter.

404
00:24:29,784 --> 00:24:40,803
Speaker 1: so yeah, well partly only because we were there like three hours before our flight all told yeah But even so it's like no one ever misses their flight because computers mess up Don't you know you?

405
00:24:40,823 --> 00:24:43,680
Speaker 1: eventually they're like oh shit this flight is leaving real soon.

406
00:24:43,961 --> 00:24:44,925
Speaker 1: Hey, who's on this flight?

407
00:24:44,965 --> 00:24:48,099
Speaker 1: That's leaving real soon, and you raise your hand and they say come here come here come here.

408
00:24:49,563 --> 00:24:51,171
Speaker 0: Same time though they were not.

409
00:24:51,191 --> 00:24:56,076
Speaker 0: I mean it kind of bothers me that It seemed like there's no sort of way to work around this at all.

410
00:24:56,116 --> 00:24:56,960
Speaker 0: and jet blues.

411
00:24:57,361 --> 00:25:06,994
Speaker 0: I guess way of dealing with it was to have a young woman yell really quietly Into a roaring crowd which people should come up, and it really wasn't working.

412
00:25:07,014 --> 00:25:08,880
Speaker 0: and I'll bet some people miss their plan and intercom.

413
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,686
Speaker 1: They weren't using.

414
00:25:09,767 --> 00:25:16,817
Speaker 1: I know it was right there right there Yeah, but it didn't cause me a problem so and our flight was delayed by 30 minutes anyway, so whatever.

415
00:25:16,917 --> 00:25:23,368
Speaker 0: yeah chilling in the airport We actually had to go to that kind of creepy other Temporary terminal with a little shuttle off in the car.

416
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:24,572
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't even know that existed.

417
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,780
Speaker 1: people at JFK Airport, right?

418
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,984
Speaker 1: There's this famous terminal.

419
00:25:28,004 --> 00:25:32,378
Speaker 1: terminal five is the old TWA terminal and my dad keeps talking about it all the time.

420
00:25:32,438 --> 00:25:36,270
Speaker 0: because yeah If you're curious just Wikipedia TWA right it's an interesting story.

421
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:40,960
Speaker 1: basically this terminal opened up to much fanfare and from above It's in the shape of an airplane.

422
00:25:41,143 --> 00:25:45,069
Speaker 1: It was real fancy But it's been for as long as I've been going to JFK.

423
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:48,699
Speaker 1: the thing has been empty because TWA gone right no more.

424
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:54,799
Speaker 1: But jet blue basically ran out of space and their terminal which is the next-door terminal which is terminal six.

425
00:25:55,362 --> 00:25:58,920
Speaker 1: So they bought terminal five, but they needed more gates right away.

426
00:25:59,061 --> 00:26:06,960
Speaker 1: So they actually built sort of a temporary terminal behind Terminal five and they have a shuttle bus that takes you there, and I didn't even know it existed.

427
00:26:07,061 --> 00:26:08,729
Speaker 1: But we took it and it worked.

428
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:09,533
Speaker 1: It was just fine.

429
00:26:09,795 --> 00:26:14,192
Speaker 0: It was totally cool Yeah, the sad thing is though much like how Pax's Wi-Fi wasn't so hot.

430
00:26:14,774 --> 00:26:17,671
Speaker 0: the airport Wi-Fi was real strong But didn't work at all.

431
00:26:17,752 --> 00:26:18,579
Speaker 0: and there's what is this?

432
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:24,300
Speaker 1: What is this lately with the free you know little local not Wi-Fi networks right having a strong signal?

433
00:26:24,702 --> 00:26:26,733
Speaker 1: But not actually working when you connect to them.

434
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:27,457
Speaker 1: What is trivial?

435
00:26:27,497 --> 00:26:28,040
Speaker 0: its interference?

436
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:33,080
Speaker 0: It's actually very difficult to put together a large-scale Wi-Fi network that works well.

437
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,619
Speaker 1: Why don't we sell like a package that people can set up that will work?

438
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,281
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

439
00:26:37,302 --> 00:26:37,784
Speaker 0: a package?

440
00:26:38,145 --> 00:26:41,420
Speaker 0: you basically have to put the things in the exact right location right?

441
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:45,926
Speaker 1: We have a little thing where you walk around with the access point, and then it beeps when it says I'm in a good spot.

442
00:26:46,087 --> 00:26:46,630
Speaker 0: That's not.

443
00:26:46,691 --> 00:26:47,658
Speaker 0: that won't really help you.

444
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,105
Speaker 0: now I won't tell you where to put it.

445
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,080
Speaker 0: also a lot of people don't realize how the antennas should be oriented.

446
00:26:53,304 --> 00:26:55,732
Speaker 1: People don't realize you can change the channels on these things.

447
00:26:55,933 --> 00:26:57,940
Speaker 1: well everyone leaves them all on the same channel.

448
00:26:58,001 --> 00:26:59,940
Speaker 1: They don't change it to like you know 11 and stuff.

449
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,973
Speaker 0: It's not just that I see people point the antennas and dumb.

450
00:27:01,993 --> 00:27:05,268
Speaker 0: well let me put it this way I took an entire class at RIT.

451
00:27:05,288 --> 00:27:08,280
Speaker 0: That was basically where to put access points.

452
00:27:08,642 --> 00:27:17,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, we walked around RIT with detectors, and we oh my god That was a fun class, but the funny thing that was a very popular class to every single quarter.

453
00:27:17,361 --> 00:27:19,914
Speaker 1: I would always see kids with a little push carts walking around doing that.

454
00:27:20,215 --> 00:27:26,415
Speaker 0: but the funny thing was Basically we're sitting there, and there's this cluster of nerds all sitting around with laptops.

455
00:27:26,756 --> 00:27:28,340
Speaker 0: cuz there's an other some holes some outlets.

456
00:27:28,401 --> 00:27:29,219
Speaker 0: They're in a power strip.

457
00:27:29,582 --> 00:27:33,300
Speaker 1: Everyone's got their laptops at me and rim didn't need the holes cuz we had Fujitsu.

458
00:27:33,661 --> 00:27:35,548
Speaker 1: Hi, everyone else is desperate for the holes.

459
00:27:35,668 --> 00:27:37,775
Speaker 0: one guy's like my battery only lasts an hour.

460
00:27:37,795 --> 00:27:39,000
Speaker 0: this laptops brand-new.

461
00:27:39,341 --> 00:27:42,031
Speaker 1: Yeah, one guy was obviously a PAX guy running Linux.

462
00:27:42,392 --> 00:27:44,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, one guy might have been a PAX guy.

463
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,747
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was an old business man.

464
00:27:46,767 --> 00:27:47,891
Speaker 1: Who was talking too much?

465
00:27:47,971 --> 00:27:50,340
Speaker 0: that old businessman was clearly very drunk.

466
00:27:50,581 --> 00:27:52,268
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, he was real.

467
00:27:52,308 --> 00:27:53,493
Speaker 1: He was real talkative.

468
00:27:54,376 --> 00:27:55,280
Speaker 1: He was halfway to drunk.

469
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:58,050
Speaker 0: Maybe you could smell the liquor on him.

470
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,476
Speaker 1: I didn't smell any liquors.

471
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:00,520
Speaker 0: man was drunk.

472
00:28:03,263 --> 00:28:05,433
Speaker 0: But whatever we took a late flight.

473
00:28:05,674 --> 00:28:14,951
Speaker 0: so basically we left it like 945 and we got to Seattle at like 1 30 in the morning And then we you know went to bed.

474
00:28:15,211 --> 00:28:16,716
Speaker 0: yeah pretty much collapsed right.

475
00:28:16,817 --> 00:28:17,780
Speaker 1: so we woke up.

476
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,727
Speaker 1: And what do we do in Seattle?

477
00:28:19,767 --> 00:28:21,474
Speaker 1: well we ate food.

478
00:28:21,815 --> 00:28:23,080
Speaker 0: well first you know we got up.

479
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,304
Speaker 0: We had plenty of time before the console.

480
00:28:24,324 --> 00:28:25,107
Speaker 0: we wandered around.

481
00:28:25,448 --> 00:28:28,960
Speaker 0: we went over to the famous by accident the Pike Place Market.

482
00:28:29,522 --> 00:28:39,937
Speaker 1: Yeah, apparently on the water there right cuz you can walk towards the water or away from it And it's not the Pacific Ocean sadly but it's water and there's a lot of boats and ferries and cruise ships and things in that water.

483
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:48,159
Speaker 1: right and You know there's like this big market like right up on the water there It's it's all sorts of stuff going on.

484
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:56,280
Speaker 1: It's like this is one fish fish cellar there And he's he's got like people singing and dancing and you know selling fish and throwing fish.

485
00:28:56,441 --> 00:29:00,420
Speaker 0: And I didn't realize what the place was until I saw this monkfish hanging there.

486
00:29:00,521 --> 00:29:06,980
Speaker 0: There was a sign that said hi I'm a monkfish, and I had seen that exact thing on FARC like a hundred times.

487
00:29:08,322 --> 00:29:10,930
Speaker 0: So I suddenly realized wait a minute now.

488
00:29:10,991 --> 00:29:11,854
Speaker 0: I've been the place.

489
00:29:11,894 --> 00:29:13,660
Speaker 0: what where that monkfish has also been.

490
00:29:14,641 --> 00:29:17,332
Speaker 1: It's really touristy down there, but there's all sorts of cool stuff.

491
00:29:17,392 --> 00:29:19,240
Speaker 1: I mean there's a hat shop, right?

492
00:29:19,541 --> 00:29:23,140
Speaker 0: Yeah of all the things we're walking we find this hattery.

493
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,148
Speaker 1: So I have a dasher if you exactly.

494
00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:26,990
Speaker 0: and they hate.

495
00:29:27,111 --> 00:29:30,623
Speaker 0: and the thing is this guy had like one of every possible Kind of hat.

496
00:29:31,185 --> 00:29:32,933
Speaker 1: yeah, I mean you named the kind of hat he's got.

497
00:29:32,953 --> 00:29:34,319
Speaker 1: he got Panama top.

498
00:29:37,385 --> 00:29:38,856
Speaker 0: You had some really classy bowler hats.

499
00:29:38,917 --> 00:29:41,465
Speaker 0: yeah bowler I need one of the.

500
00:29:41,505 --> 00:29:47,651
Speaker 0: I need a new because they used to have this really good Australian leather hat that Eventually shrunk and no one cowboy no longer fit so much.

501
00:29:47,772 --> 00:29:52,228
Speaker 0: I can't head so I need to buy a new Kind of Stetson style.

502
00:29:52,589 --> 00:29:53,553
Speaker 0: I'm a cowboy.

503
00:29:53,654 --> 00:29:55,060
Speaker 0: I'm an Australian awesome, dude.

504
00:29:55,282 --> 00:29:58,602
Speaker 0: I need a leather hat kind of thing beanie Beret.

505
00:29:58,743 --> 00:30:03,241
Speaker 0: the only reason I didn't buy one right then and there in Seattle is the Seattle is that I didn't want to fly At home.

506
00:30:03,905 --> 00:30:12,239
Speaker 0: I can't think of any other kinds of hats yeah, but we walked around and you know Trying to figure out where should we eat breakfast because we never get to eat breakfast anywhere And I'm not gonna linger on this now.

507
00:30:12,601 --> 00:30:18,483
Speaker 0: We went to some random hole-in-the-wall was kind of average-looking and that was one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever eaten.

508
00:30:18,503 --> 00:30:24,959
Speaker 1: I mean I really wanted like a big you know waffles pancakes kind of thing But I couldn't find such a place easily.

509
00:30:25,301 --> 00:30:29,440
Speaker 0: I don't think there are diners in Seattle or if there are there was no way for us to find them with.

510
00:30:30,901 --> 00:30:31,969
Speaker 1: He's not like the diners.

511
00:30:31,989 --> 00:30:36,031
Speaker 1: We have in Jersey, New York, Connecticut You know where even the diners in the Midwest there was.

512
00:30:36,353 --> 00:30:37,820
Speaker 0: I couldn't find anything like a diner.

513
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:50,820
Speaker 0: It was mostly like the course met about the area we were in but was mostly like tap houses and bar and grills and There were a lot of like crepe places and breakfast places that were basically glorified coffee shops selling like scones.

514
00:30:51,001 --> 00:30:52,586
Speaker 1: And there's a lot of coffee shops.

515
00:30:52,626 --> 00:30:54,513
Speaker 1: I mean Seattle's the home of Starbucks.

516
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:56,460
Speaker 1: It's also the home of Seattle's best coffee.

517
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:01,280
Speaker 1: It's also the home of like a hundred other like individual independent coffee.

518
00:31:02,124 --> 00:31:05,940
Speaker 1: This is fucking everywhere like I mean in New York.

519
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,260
Speaker 1: You might find like a Chinese restaurant like every few blocks in freakin Seattle.

520
00:31:10,441 --> 00:31:14,533
Speaker 1: There's like two coffees on the side of every block.

521
00:31:14,814 --> 00:31:16,560
Speaker 1: That's like eight coffees per block.

522
00:31:16,862 --> 00:31:17,568
Speaker 1: It's ridiculous.

523
00:31:17,588 --> 00:31:19,000
Speaker 0: The thing is New York City.

524
00:31:19,301 --> 00:31:20,646
Speaker 0: I feel like the density

525
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:24,037
Speaker 1: of New York City has a lot but only half as many as see how

526
00:31:24,057 --> 00:31:34,502
Speaker 0: I don't think so you see yeah, maybe just I'm in Midtown, but there are I Exactly eight Starbucks within a trivial walk of my office and I've gone to all of them more than once Yeah,

527
00:31:35,003 --> 00:31:35,144
Speaker 1: but

528
00:31:35,726 --> 00:31:39,620
Speaker 0: I feel like despite it being the whole like everyone says yes, Seattle Starbucks blah blah blah.

529
00:31:40,161 --> 00:31:44,439
Speaker 0: The I guess proportion of Starbucks to other coffee shops was actually real low.

530
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,432
Speaker 1: Third a third maybe at most with Starbucks.

531
00:31:50,296 --> 00:31:50,577
Speaker 1: I don't know.

532
00:31:50,597 --> 00:31:51,100
Speaker 1: it's hard to tell.

533
00:31:51,401 --> 00:31:57,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know a lot of Starbucks, but there are a lot of non Starbucks - anyway Yeah, but so we walk around with this.

534
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:01,590
Speaker 0: really good, but we couldn't find like yeah We couldn't find like a diner or anything.

535
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:11,860
Speaker 1: So we just find a place It's like, you know cafe whatever and we go in and we say make me you know Bacon egg and cheese on an English muffin and it was bacon egg and cheese in an English muffin.

536
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,987
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's like.

537
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:20,160
Speaker 1: it wasn't like this so amazing breakfast But it was like they put like an extra care into making it and it was actually really sad.

538
00:32:20,341 --> 00:32:22,858
Speaker 0: It's like they spent like imagine if someone just makes a sandwich, right?

539
00:32:23,361 --> 00:32:27,095
Speaker 0: Imagine if the same person spent five more seconds on that sandwich.

540
00:32:27,356 --> 00:32:31,500
Speaker 1: that makes a lot of difference Actually, and they put a little bit of care into it and I was like, oh that was real.

541
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,730
Speaker 1: And then as soon as you take two steps, we see a place.

542
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:42,373
Speaker 0: This is breakfast on the window and I'm like, ah We just talk about all the breakfast we had right now.

543
00:32:42,414 --> 00:32:45,084
Speaker 0: All right, so Place what a show this.

544
00:32:45,205 --> 00:32:46,369
Speaker 0: is that Seattle?

545
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:49,140
Speaker 1: Yeah the place that we saw that said breakfast on the window.

546
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,619
Speaker 1: We ate there for breakfast the next day.

547
00:32:52,061 --> 00:32:56,853
Speaker 1: Also, not a diner basically a coffee shop basically a coffee shop and you know, it was over.

548
00:32:57,194 --> 00:32:57,976
Speaker 0: It was weird.

549
00:32:58,437 --> 00:33:01,568
Speaker 0: They didn't have Sausage or bacon?

550
00:33:02,011 --> 00:33:03,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, you couldn't order it.

551
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,203
Speaker 0: I was like like.

552
00:33:04,243 --> 00:33:06,734
Speaker 0: I'm looking at the menu and I'm looking for like because I don't.

553
00:33:06,774 --> 00:33:13,500
Speaker 0: I wanted like I don't know Scrambled eggs and sausage and bacon and some pancakes, but no I couldn't get anything like that.

554
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,185
Speaker 1: Yeah, what did I get?

555
00:33:14,386 --> 00:33:15,031
Speaker 1: I get a waffle.

556
00:33:15,071 --> 00:33:16,220
Speaker 0: I think yeah like a waffle.

557
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,354
Speaker 1: I think I got the Belgian waffle and I think I was slightly disappointed.

558
00:33:19,374 --> 00:33:20,580
Speaker 1: I think it was slightly overpriced.

559
00:33:20,841 --> 00:33:22,186
Speaker 0: Another thing I can say that's right.

560
00:33:22,207 --> 00:33:23,452
Speaker 1: I got a good beverage though.

561
00:33:23,492 --> 00:33:25,440
Speaker 1: And but yeah, you didn't you didn't you picked a bad?

562
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,082
Speaker 1: Well, I failed.

563
00:33:26,283 --> 00:33:26,684
Speaker 1: you failed.

564
00:33:26,744 --> 00:33:30,940
Speaker 0: another thing that there's a lot of juice bars and a lot of hippie Randy BS in Seattle.

565
00:33:31,161 --> 00:33:43,685
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not so much hippie Randy BS as much as it's just general hippiness a little bit of Randy But a lot of you know, sorta the Randy was more diffuse Yeah, definitely different.

566
00:33:43,705 --> 00:33:48,420
Speaker 1: there was a lot of Randy there was there was he was sort of hidden a little bit.

567
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,745
Speaker 1: It wasn't surface Randy.

568
00:33:49,785 --> 00:33:56,135
Speaker 1: It was like, you know, take a step in, you know beyond the you know Just typical hippiness and then the Randy is, you know back there.

569
00:33:56,638 --> 00:34:00,919
Speaker 0: Yeah there I mean I saw a lot of reflexology people walking around with signs now.

570
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:08,780
Speaker 0: But anyway, it was just weird that in at no time in Seattle Was I able to get a breakfast likening to what I would eat in New York or Michigan?

571
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:13,420
Speaker 1: Well, you know people on Twitter right and Twitter is actually helpful in this respect to find a place to eat.

572
00:34:13,842 --> 00:34:15,918
Speaker 1: they said to just go eat it like, you know, the.

573
00:34:16,724 --> 00:34:26,712
Speaker 0: You know the Pike place bar and grill for you know breakfast Yeah, and it turns out actually a lot of those bar and grill places during the day just serve breakfast But again, not a diner breakfast.

574
00:34:26,772 --> 00:34:27,998
Speaker 0: kind of weird not quite.

575
00:34:28,018 --> 00:34:31,478
Speaker 1: No Well, I mean, I got French toast and bacon and that was actually really good bacon's.

576
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:40,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, I gotta talk about one thing though because we're we kept walking past this New York style bagel place And you know, I keep it's kind of.

577
00:34:40,752 --> 00:34:42,120
Speaker 1: it's funny wait there on Labor Day.

578
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:49,053
Speaker 0: I think it's kind of like someone who say you're I don't know you're in you're live in Chicago You go to Florida and you see like Chicago style pizza.

579
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:50,520
Speaker 0: I definitely got that kind of Bob.

580
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:50,940
Speaker 0: You know what?

581
00:34:51,161 --> 00:34:54,152
Speaker 1: It's like if you go to somewhere in Jersey or even farther.

582
00:34:54,172 --> 00:34:56,420
Speaker 1: you like, Florida and they're like Philly cheesesteak.

583
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:02,080
Speaker 0: You're like, ah, no, no, no, no, however, I can say one thing bagels taste the same everywhere.

584
00:35:04,401 --> 00:35:05,025
Speaker 1: It depends.

585
00:35:05,085 --> 00:35:07,420
Speaker 0: now it is the thing bagels taste the same.

586
00:35:07,822 --> 00:35:09,008
Speaker 0: These were actually bagels.

587
00:35:09,048 --> 00:35:14,505
Speaker 0: if they make it the way you make a bagel it tastes the same Tasted exactly the same.

588
00:35:14,866 --> 00:35:17,335
Speaker 1: It was an okay bagel, but it was identical to the bagel.

589
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:17,676
Speaker 0: I get it.

590
00:35:17,696 --> 00:35:18,459
Speaker 0: the hot and crusty.

591
00:35:19,122 --> 00:35:23,520
Speaker 1: No, the hot and crusty isn't the isn't the best bagel in the universe either, but it was identical to that.

592
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,443
Speaker 0: What better bagel?

593
00:35:24,865 --> 00:35:26,611
Speaker 1: Yeah, we got to Queens.

594
00:35:26,651 --> 00:35:27,354
Speaker 1: I'll get you some big.

595
00:35:27,394 --> 00:35:27,956
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see.

596
00:35:27,996 --> 00:35:29,160
Speaker 0: I don't think there's any difference.

597
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:30,167
Speaker 0: There's a line.

598
00:35:30,227 --> 00:35:32,240
Speaker 0: there's a line beyond which a bagel is a bagel.

599
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,896
Speaker 1: Yeah, there there are some really good bagels out there.

600
00:35:35,977 --> 00:35:38,206
Speaker 1: I don't know You don't have to do mouth.

601
00:35:38,487 --> 00:35:40,477
Speaker 0: So you don't you wouldn't know I don't have the Jew mouth.

602
00:35:40,517 --> 00:35:42,685
Speaker 0: bagels in Seattle Tastes the same as bagels here.

603
00:35:42,705 --> 00:35:44,953
Speaker 1: No, that bagel was you know, did the?

604
00:35:45,153 --> 00:35:48,800
Speaker 1: it would tasted different than a hot and crusty bagel But it was about equivalent quality level.

605
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,594
Speaker 0: No, anyway, this is you got it with capers and stuff.

606
00:35:53,916 --> 00:35:54,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was awesome.

607
00:35:54,841 --> 00:35:55,584
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got I got.

608
00:35:55,645 --> 00:35:57,775
Speaker 1: they just didn't give me just you know, we're on that.

609
00:35:57,835 --> 00:35:58,720
Speaker 1: We're on the water.

610
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,704
Speaker 1: There's this fish.

611
00:35:59,945 --> 00:36:02,939
Speaker 1: There's a fish market where people are singing and dancing fish fish.

612
00:36:03,281 --> 00:36:05,400
Speaker 1: So I didn't just get a bagel with lox and cream cheese.

613
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,150
Speaker 1: I got a bagel with lox and cream cheese tomato onion and capers.

614
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:11,160
Speaker 0: I got a bagel with extra lox and cream cheese.

615
00:36:11,722 --> 00:36:12,926
Speaker 1: All right, it was good times.

616
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:14,712
Speaker 0: Yeah enough about breakfast.

617
00:36:14,732 --> 00:36:15,535
Speaker 0: Let's talk about Seattle.

618
00:36:15,635 --> 00:36:16,860
Speaker 1: No, you only want to talk about lunch.

619
00:36:19,401 --> 00:36:24,038
Speaker 1: Let's talk about Seattle a little alright, so Seattle is kind of weird at least the part that we were in one.

620
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:32,092
Speaker 0: It felt like this is my sound strange Maybe just cuz we're from New York, but it felt Really really small and really really uncrowded like.

621
00:36:32,152 --> 00:36:37,634
Speaker 1: it also felt sort of like a shopping mall Like even you're on the street, but it felt like you're in a shopping mall.

622
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:50,833
Speaker 0: now granted we wandered You know, we didn't wander around all of Seattle like I really wanted to go to Fremont, but we didn't have time but We wandered pretty far and everywhere felt kind of the same in the streets Like the sidewalks are really wide and even on like Friday.

623
00:36:50,874 --> 00:36:52,480
Speaker 0: There really weren't people in the streets.

624
00:36:52,621 --> 00:36:54,900
Speaker 1: It was weird because I saw these huge buildings, right?

625
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,489
Speaker 1: And I said there must be a bajillion employees in that building.

626
00:36:57,991 --> 00:37:04,656
Speaker 1: and I could understand those employees not being in town Saturday Sunday Labor Day, but in Friday, it didn't seem like those employees were around.

627
00:37:04,776 --> 00:37:05,780
Speaker 1: even around five o'clock.

628
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:11,040
Speaker 1: I didn't see them spilling into the streets, you know, that building must have like thousands thousands of desks in it.

629
00:37:11,442 --> 00:37:14,780
Speaker 1: I didn't see thousands of thousands people come pouring out of the building, you know.

630
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,128
Speaker 1: And there are a lot of those buildings.

631
00:37:16,148 --> 00:37:17,577
Speaker 1: and I was like where the hell are all the people?

632
00:37:17,597 --> 00:37:19,185
Speaker 1: it never Felt crowded.

633
00:37:19,225 --> 00:37:26,416
Speaker 1: that just might be because they've got the traffic down, you know Even though I doubt it cuz anyone who's from anywhere will always complain about traffic no matter what.

634
00:37:26,576 --> 00:37:29,319
Speaker 0: well one thing I can say That might just really good.

635
00:37:30,061 --> 00:37:36,319
Speaker 0: Walking around on Friday and even after the con I saw more people who were there because of packs than I did people who live there.

636
00:37:36,742 --> 00:37:47,737
Speaker 1: Yeah, really walking around even like going far away I would say one-third to one-half of the people I saw Outside of the convention center at any moment in time where Pat were packs people.

637
00:37:48,018 --> 00:37:49,647
Speaker 0: now, you know I was really wondering about that.

638
00:37:49,707 --> 00:37:58,237
Speaker 0: and finally, you know, I looked on Wikipedia I'm on Wikipedia right now to to remember the number the population of Seattle is only like 600,000 people.

639
00:37:59,521 --> 00:38:00,705
Speaker 0: Really yeah, there's.

640
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:07,834
Speaker 0: I mean, there's like four million people in the greater metro area, but in Seattle is Basically two and a half of the suburb.

641
00:38:07,854 --> 00:38:16,180
Speaker 0: I lived in in Michigan Whoa, and as a result think of this packs was like a 12th of the population of Seattle.

642
00:38:16,521 --> 00:38:17,845
Speaker 1: So one in 12 people.

643
00:38:17,865 --> 00:38:19,170
Speaker 1: that that seems about right.

644
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:29,369
Speaker 0: that does seem about right all things considered because packs people would be more likely To be outside as opposed to in a building because we didn't know where to go or wander and walking around looking around Walking around looking around.

645
00:38:29,389 --> 00:38:31,360
Speaker 1: it was the streets were a nice grid.

646
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:41,835
Speaker 1: I mean at first I was a little disoriented but I sort of used the water and away from the water as guides and You know east and west of the convention center as guides and my hotel.

647
00:38:41,855 --> 00:38:45,089
Speaker 1: the red line is pretty tall So I can sort of figure out where it was.

648
00:38:45,169 --> 00:38:52,952
Speaker 1: and I learned where I was going pretty quick And I had a lot of landmarks and it was sort of like, you know Learning your way around a map in a video game.

649
00:38:52,972 --> 00:38:55,828
Speaker 1: you walk around a little bit Just not knowing where you're going.

650
00:38:55,848 --> 00:39:03,419
Speaker 1: you just keep walking and then within a few minutes You only passed by a place twice, you know coming from two different directions and you've got to figure it out.

651
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,824
Speaker 0: But impressions of Seattle.

652
00:39:04,844 --> 00:39:12,112
Speaker 0: this might be stereotypical but and I think I mentioned it on the Tuesday show, but I'd like to mention it again No one in Seattle.

653
00:39:12,133 --> 00:39:14,085
Speaker 0: jaywalks Like they just don't.

654
00:39:14,105 --> 00:39:28,015
Speaker 0: there'll be no traffic in either direction like not like not a car as far as you can see lights red Crowd of people just stand there just stand and wait Yeah, and then we walk and then sometimes when you walk someone else will follow you.

655
00:39:28,436 --> 00:39:31,547
Speaker 1: but I don't think anyone Instigated a jaywalk other than us.

656
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:34,096
Speaker 0: and even then people who followed us and not just us.

657
00:39:34,116 --> 00:39:38,717
Speaker 0: when I say us I mean Everyone from New York because you could pick out the other New Yorkers

658
00:39:38,958 --> 00:39:39,380
Speaker 1: easily

659
00:39:39,682 --> 00:39:43,220
Speaker 0: You'd see him in the distance walking twice as fast as everyone in the street

660
00:39:44,481 --> 00:39:53,350
Speaker 1: Actually had trouble readjusting to New York walking after Seattle walking I'm bumping into people and I'm like, oh, yeah, right people I have to actually, you know walk properly.

661
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:55,980
Speaker 1: Yeah cuz yeah, I got real lazy with my walking in Seattle.

662
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,740
Speaker 1: You can just walk all willy-nilly on this big wide empty side.

663
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,005
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was cool.

664
00:40:00,046 --> 00:40:03,380
Speaker 0: Like if I want as fast as you want like we saw this map store, right?

665
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:09,949
Speaker 0: So when we saw the map store, like we stopped outside of it like just in the sidewalk I just stopped and was looking at it.

666
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:16,080
Speaker 1: if I did that in New York, I'd be dead Wouldn't be dead but two people would have bumped into your ass and go an asshole.

667
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,614
Speaker 0: I Actually, I want to talk about that map source.

668
00:40:19,634 --> 00:40:20,179
Speaker 0: That was really cool.

669
00:40:20,441 --> 00:40:21,710
Speaker 1: So we see this map store.

670
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:25,107
Speaker 1: and the second time we see the map store We decided to go into the map store as a store.

671
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:32,119
Speaker 0: They sell maps globes and related Cartographical items at live perhaps charts all those sorts of things.

672
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:41,596
Speaker 0: now There's a map store near where I work in Manhattan, but it's basically one of those hagstrom kind of you know Useful modern maps of things and nautical charts and GPS.

673
00:40:41,637 --> 00:40:42,360
Speaker 0: is not that BS?

674
00:40:43,501 --> 00:40:50,119
Speaker 0: This was the map store equivalent of like a geek gamer store for gamers, it was like map geeks would come here.

675
00:40:50,661 --> 00:40:54,980
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, and the thing is the guy the proprietor of the store was the old man.

676
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,344
Speaker 0: Obviously he was.

677
00:40:56,825 --> 00:40:59,713
Speaker 0: this dude was a mad geek and you could totally tell.

678
00:40:59,994 --> 00:41:02,964
Speaker 0: so we walk in and the guys like Can I help you?

679
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:05,961
Speaker 0: and he's like, you know, he's nice, but he's not excited He's.

680
00:41:06,404 --> 00:41:08,295
Speaker 0: he's probably like the game store guy.

681
00:41:08,316 --> 00:41:14,260
Speaker 1: who's thinking Imagine if you run a video game a regular board game store.

682
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:18,640
Speaker 1: Right, you sell the CCG's and the D&D but you also sell the good stuff, right?

683
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,200
Speaker 1: Some kid comes in and says I want you geocards.

684
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:21,784

00:41:34,104 --> 00:41:34,706
Speaker 1: guy comes in.

00:41:34,726 --> 00:41:39,557
Speaker 1: He says hey, I heard about this burning wheel and you go, ho ho ho Did you now?

693
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,604
Speaker 1: We were like that.

694
00:41:41,745 --> 00:41:43,533
Speaker 1: No, did you now to this map guy?

695
00:41:43,553 --> 00:41:45,020
Speaker 0: It's basically I had no plan.

696
00:41:45,081 --> 00:41:46,515
Speaker 0: I walked in cuz a cool store.

697
00:41:46,717 --> 00:41:49,973
Speaker 0: I'm bored I got plenty of time and then the guy, you know, can I help you?

698
00:41:50,114 --> 00:41:51,400
Speaker 0: and I don't just say no, I'm all right.

699
00:41:51,480 --> 00:42:03,680
Speaker 0: I think a minute I consider the question and then I turned to him and say Actually, do you happen to have any period nautical charts or military maps from the Napoleonic War era particularly of the English Channel?

700
00:42:04,621 --> 00:42:16,488
Speaker 0: and he's pauses and he looks up thoughtfully and Then like he seems to get really excited like he starts moving his fists up and down like uh, I don't think so but but hold on bear with me bear with me.

701
00:42:16,508 --> 00:42:25,154
Speaker 0: and he starts going through all these maps and things and he's looking in this reference book and like trying to cross reference and then he's like, no, I don't have any.

702
00:42:25,495 --> 00:42:27,179
Speaker 0: no one's really asked for anything like that before.

703
00:42:27,259 --> 00:42:28,958
Speaker 0: but Tell you what.

704
00:42:29,482 --> 00:42:30,969
Speaker 0: What you should do is call the library of.

705
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:38,254
Speaker 0: and he starts giving me all this crazy advice about How to get a hold of like nautical charts period nautical charts of the English Channel.

706
00:42:38,314 --> 00:42:41,385
Speaker 0: and he's super excited and like ten minutes He tells me the business.

707
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:44,480
Speaker 1: How do you open up a map store if you're not a map nerd?

708
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,385
Speaker 1: I mean, come on.

709
00:42:45,747 --> 00:42:47,739
Speaker 0: I have a feeling that we made this dude's day.

710
00:42:48,301 --> 00:42:55,260
Speaker 1: It's weird cuz in New York City, there's a store of every kind right but everything's crammed in and tight, right?

711
00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:00,640
Speaker 1: So and unless you know where a lot of these things are because a lot of them are not in the crowded thoroughfares, right?

712
00:43:00,841 --> 00:43:04,760
Speaker 1: They're off to the sides and the villages or whatnot where you don't go too often.

713
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:06,226
Speaker 1: You're not gonna know about them.

714
00:43:06,246 --> 00:43:09,459
Speaker 1: You have to sort of look them up and then specifically go to where they are.

715
00:43:09,802 --> 00:43:11,560
Speaker 1: You know, I mean, I'm sure there's a map store in the city.

716
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:14,613
Speaker 1: I could find if I searched for it, but I had to search Seattle.

717
00:43:14,975 --> 00:43:21,116
Speaker 1: We actually walked around I'd say effectively all of downtown Seattle at least where there was stuff.

718
00:43:21,196 --> 00:43:22,280
Speaker 0: now only downtown.

719
00:43:22,381 --> 00:43:24,440
Speaker 0: We clearly did not get to all the other off.

720
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:33,540
Speaker 1: We didn't go to the residential areas or say the college area Seattle itself is sitting on the borders of the city of Seattle were big but the downtown Seattle.

721
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:35,959
Speaker 1: You could actually walk around all of it.

722
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,471
Speaker 1: You know at least you know, most of the important parts.

723
00:43:38,592 --> 00:43:39,295
Speaker 1: pretty quickly.

724
00:43:39,677 --> 00:43:42,848
Speaker 1: if you don't you know Go like a slow Seattle person according to Wikipedia.

725
00:43:42,909 --> 00:43:44,735
Speaker 0: Seattle was originally called New York.

726
00:43:45,116 --> 00:43:45,578
Speaker 1: Really?

727
00:43:45,598 --> 00:43:55,100
Speaker 0: Yes The only members of the party that did not migrate to the Eastern Shore Established a village they initially called New York after Terry's hometown.

728
00:43:55,202 --> 00:44:00,758
Speaker 0: Oh They eventually renamed it alkie a Chinook a Chinook word.

729
00:44:00,778 --> 00:44:08,344
Speaker 0: Sorry I'm reading from Wikipedia quickly meaning by and by or someday blah blah blah blah blah blah Eventually Seattle.

730
00:44:08,706 --> 00:44:09,810
Speaker 1: What does Seattle come from?

731
00:44:10,131 --> 00:44:17,525

732
00:44:17,806 --> 00:44:18,248
Speaker 1: Yeah.

00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:19,373
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

734
00:44:19,915 --> 00:44:21,000
Speaker 0: Maybe we should call it, New York.

735
00:44:21,971 --> 00:44:26,341
Speaker 0: Yeah Now anyway, but yeah, you know we walked her out We went to.

736
00:44:26,582 --> 00:44:29,514
Speaker 0: we went to this weird store and all I want to say about it is one.

737
00:44:29,815 --> 00:44:33,322
Speaker 0: it had two items of note items of interest Item.

738
00:44:33,362 --> 00:44:38,020
Speaker 0: the first a really really big and scary statue of Mark Twain.

739
00:44:38,582 --> 00:44:39,806
Speaker 1: Oh this door item.

740
00:44:39,866 --> 00:44:46,366
Speaker 0: the second a miniature version of that a version of that exact same Creepy-ass hot dog in Wildwood.

741
00:44:46,647 --> 00:44:51,600
Speaker 1: They also had these cool Uncle Scrooge statues and some cool pirate statues.

742
00:44:52,282 --> 00:45:00,851
Speaker 1: It's basically one of those, you know Asian import stores, but they seem to specialize in like, you know big statue things Especially Disney ones, however, I kind of wish about.

743
00:45:00,952 --> 00:45:02,920
Speaker 1: they got that uncle Scrooge statue at the same time.

744
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:08,300
Speaker 0: The smell the store smelled vaguely of incense used to cover weed and I could not find a proprietor.

745
00:45:08,961 --> 00:45:09,846
Speaker 1: There was a proprietor.

746
00:45:09,886 --> 00:45:11,898
Speaker 1: I saw them go into the back as we came in.

747
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:18,236
Speaker 1: Ah Possibly to burn some incense possibly to run away from us crazies from New York.

748
00:45:18,336 --> 00:45:22,460
Speaker 0: Yeah at that point I think we still look like New Yorkers cuz I kind of had my gate going again.

749
00:45:22,701 --> 00:45:33,709
Speaker 1: Yeah, we also went to this toy store, which is pretty much just old-fashioned toy store You know doesn't sell modern toys sells real toys and they had some good stuff in there But nothing I haven't seen anywhere else really.

750
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:35,196
Speaker 1: It's not that I can remember.

751
00:45:35,437 --> 00:45:36,663
Speaker 0: one thing I can say though That was cool.

752
00:45:36,723 --> 00:45:38,594
Speaker 0: Was that a row you had?

753
00:45:38,614 --> 00:45:39,700
Speaker 1: they had a horse head on a stick?

754
00:45:40,061 --> 00:45:44,820
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, they did but our row are you know, our listener was taking us around her and her boyfriend and her Asian posse.

755
00:45:45,221 --> 00:45:46,084
Speaker 0: More on them later.

756
00:45:46,104 --> 00:45:46,928
Speaker 1: Yeah Asian posse.

757
00:45:46,948 --> 00:45:47,309
Speaker 1: What's up?

758
00:45:47,731 --> 00:45:54,599
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got to respect them in a big way because Inverse wizard hat is one of the funniest things I've heard in life.

759
00:45:55,901 --> 00:46:01,140
Speaker 0: But anyway, so, uh, you know, she kept saying yeah, we should eat at the food court at the Westlake Mall.

760
00:46:01,421 --> 00:46:02,545
Speaker 0: It's the best food court ever.

761
00:46:02,605 --> 00:46:03,709
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's go get lunch there.

762
00:46:04,251 --> 00:46:08,799
Speaker 0: and I you know, we were polite but I was thinking the whole time Mall food court.

763
00:46:10,442 --> 00:46:18,736
Speaker 1: I was kind of okay with the mall food court cuz we'd ate at basically every other meal Except for that breakfast sandwich was at a real restaurant sitting down getting a real meal.

764
00:46:18,796 --> 00:46:21,887
Speaker 1: So I'm like, okay We should eat more food court once.

765
00:46:22,209 --> 00:46:31,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know, I was still like, I don't know mall food court Especially cuz I got a while I was expecting it to be like, you know The mall food court at Otacon in a little mall there.

766
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,492
Speaker 0: So when they said this is the best mall food court in the world.

767
00:46:33,512 --> 00:46:34,156
Speaker 0: They were not kidding.

768
00:46:34,236 --> 00:46:36,545
Speaker 0: Oh my god This place was exciting.

769
00:46:36,846 --> 00:46:38,732
Speaker 1: I mean it had a McDonald's.

770
00:46:38,912 --> 00:46:39,293
Speaker 1: Okay.

771
00:46:39,574 --> 00:46:45,640
Speaker 1: Okay head of Sbarro's Everything else in there except the McDonald's and the Sbarro's was awesome.

772
00:46:45,861 --> 00:46:54,148
Speaker 0: I had to choose between the really good-looking Thai food the really good-smelling Indian food and the Awesome-looking Greek food.

773
00:46:54,168 --> 00:46:55,615
Speaker 0: I ended up eating and the crepes.

774
00:46:56,278 --> 00:46:58,947
Speaker 1: Oh my god The crepes their crepes everywhere and in Seattle for some.

775
00:46:58,967 --> 00:47:03,200
Speaker 0: I ended up eating a pile of falafel and hummus and baba ghanoush and dalmati.

776
00:47:03,401 --> 00:47:06,239
Speaker 1: I got the Thai food which came with the mango lemonade.

777
00:47:07,102 --> 00:47:07,503
Speaker 1: Take that.

778
00:47:08,285 --> 00:47:08,907
Speaker 0: I got a dr.

779
00:47:08,947 --> 00:47:13,560
Speaker 0: Pepper because I had to wash down the the mass of falafel larger than I should have gotten.

780
00:47:13,861 --> 00:47:23,735
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's basically a mall food court and except for the McDonald's and the Sbarro's every place in there was like a good Interesting clean and awesome looking kind of food.

781
00:47:23,976 --> 00:47:30,180
Speaker 0: Yes speaking of clean I gotta say I love New York and you know, you can't you don't get ever accuse me of disliking New York City.

782
00:47:30,942 --> 00:47:45,320
Speaker 0: But Seattle really didn't smell like pee at all except everything was really clean except for there's one like one Side like one Street between two kind of intersections smelled like pee and had this dilapidated Johnny Rockets.

783
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,307
Speaker 0: But everything else was awesome and clean.

784
00:47:47,608 --> 00:47:51,120
Speaker 1: It was one area was sort of weird, but everything else was really clean.

785
00:47:51,534 --> 00:48:01,780
Speaker 0: Yeah And the weird thing that area was like between the two nice areas that area was like dilapidated Johnny Rockets Scary pawn shop that Johnny Rockets freaked me out cuz I never saw it open.

786
00:48:01,841 --> 00:48:02,820
Speaker 1: It was dark inside.

787
00:48:02,881 --> 00:48:07,800
Speaker 1: But if I looked in the window Now first of all, there's no indication that it was supposed to be closed or anything.

788
00:48:08,202 --> 00:48:12,722
Speaker 1: But if you looked in the window, everything was set up all the napkins are still in there and everything It was just never open.

789
00:48:13,063 --> 00:48:18,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, but right across the street was like the scariest looking hobo alley I've ever seen?

790
00:48:18,621 --> 00:48:21,897
Speaker 0: Yeah, partly because alleys are a rare thing to find in New York City.

791
00:48:21,918 --> 00:48:22,360
Speaker 0: They're not that.

792
00:48:22,581 --> 00:48:25,171
Speaker 1: No, there's plenty of alleys in New York City Manhattan.

793
00:48:25,211 --> 00:48:25,693
Speaker 0: Not so many.

794
00:48:25,713 --> 00:48:26,235
Speaker 0: Well, there are.

795
00:48:26,275 --> 00:48:29,364
Speaker 1: they just sort of closed up Not alleys anymore.

796
00:48:29,384 --> 00:48:31,550
Speaker 0: They've been converted into other things.

797
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:34,658
Speaker 0: They're not open alleys that go to that area behind.

798
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:35,300
Speaker 0: That's all cool.

799
00:48:35,862 --> 00:48:36,626
Speaker 1: No, the area.

800
00:48:36,687 --> 00:48:39,280
Speaker 1: usually if you live in the building you get to the area behind real easily.

801
00:48:39,501 --> 00:48:39,944
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not.

802
00:48:39,984 --> 00:48:42,560
Speaker 1: I mean when I lived usually the alleys just have like a door.

803
00:48:43,323 --> 00:48:51,939
Speaker 0: When I lived in Detroit, there was a functional old-school alley Behind my house and that is how we all got access to our garages.

804
00:48:51,999 --> 00:48:54,172
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean my grandma lived in Queens.

805
00:48:54,232 --> 00:49:01,638
Speaker 1: basically it was you know 169th Street the next street was just an alley with garages on both sides of it facing inwards.

806
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,684
Speaker 1: then 170th Street.

807
00:49:04,006 --> 00:49:06,820
Speaker 1: there was you know, there was an alley between every row of houses.

808
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:12,900
Speaker 1: It was like a little mini street that was wide enough for one car and had garages and backyards on both sides.

809
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:19,360
Speaker 0: But there's one thing really really cool about Seattle and that is the the catenary bus public transit.

810
00:49:19,782 --> 00:49:28,120
Speaker 0: It is kind of like it's like And a bus which could be awesome if implemented properly.

811
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:31,089
Speaker 1: I mean not every bus was using the catenaries.

812
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:31,752
Speaker 1: people don't know.

813
00:49:31,792 --> 00:49:34,380
Speaker 1: catenary is the overhead electric wires, right?

814
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:40,640
Speaker 1: Because like express buses that went out of town and came into town were like hybrids or motors or whatever.

815
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:49,545
Speaker 1: But all the buses that sort of stayed in town use the overhead electricity To power themselves rather than you know A gasoline engine or whatnot.

816
00:49:49,585 --> 00:50:06,200
Speaker 1: and there was actually on Monday when we were walking around when the convention was over We went to the bus terminal where there was like crazy wires all over the place and like tunnels and all sorts of weird Shit, and they actually they had a special tunnel for these buses to go in where there was electricity down there.

817
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:09,870
Speaker 0: Yes, basically anyone who says buses don't work as mass transit and buses suck.

818
00:50:10,191 --> 00:50:10,673
Speaker 0: You're right.

819
00:50:10,914 --> 00:50:13,060
Speaker 0: They suck everywhere except Seattle.

820
00:50:13,261 --> 00:50:20,663
Speaker 1: I think they still suck in Seattle, but they suck less But they're still Better.

821
00:50:20,723 --> 00:50:20,864
Speaker 1: not

822
00:50:20,924 --> 00:50:33,390
Speaker 0: only did I see a lot of people using them and not only did they look like they made a lot of sense But the everyone I talked to where buses came up basically, you know, if I mentioned yeah from New York They said something along the lines of the buses work pretty damn.

823
00:50:33,431 --> 00:50:36,640
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, they're not perfect, but they they work the catternet.

824
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:37,727
Speaker 0: I think they really cool.

825
00:50:37,848 --> 00:50:39,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think they work as well as buses work.

826
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,359
Speaker 1: The only problem is you can't carry around tall sticks in Seattle.

827
00:50:43,901 --> 00:50:53,633
Speaker 0: No, I was actually until I got used to it even though they were like 10 feet above my head I was real nervous about them because I wasn't nervous I didn't notice them both.

828
00:50:53,734 --> 00:50:54,520
Speaker 1: I was nervous.

829
00:50:54,620 --> 00:51:00,943
Speaker 0: It was more that I'd be walking around walking around looking around and like suddenly I'd look up and suddenly like oh shit They're right there.

830
00:51:00,963 --> 00:51:03,672
Speaker 0: Yeah, especially when I was upstairs in buildings.

831
00:51:03,732 --> 00:51:05,759
Speaker 0: I'd seem like right out the window like looking at me.

832
00:51:06,342 --> 00:51:09,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd be scared if I was like the second floor of a building on a balcony.

833
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:10,569
Speaker 1: I'd be wicked scared.

834
00:51:10,831 --> 00:51:16,418
Speaker 1: but on the sidewalk I didn't even really notice them at all except when a bus came down the street and it was actually pretty cool.

835
00:51:16,438 --> 00:51:18,335
Speaker 1: the buses You know that to connect to these wires.

836
00:51:18,376 --> 00:51:24,160
Speaker 1: somehow They were at these intelligent things that moved around and always connected to them and I never saw them fall off.

837
00:51:24,261 --> 00:51:26,137
Speaker 1: So the technology worked really well.

838
00:51:27,044 --> 00:51:31,526
Speaker 0: So speaking of mass transit in Seattle, obviously There is no subway.

839
00:51:31,887 --> 00:51:34,739
Speaker 1: No, it's not that I know about but there is a monorail.

840
00:51:34,779 --> 00:51:38,186
Speaker 0: now Here's what I knew about the monorail before I went to Seattle.

841
00:51:38,787 --> 00:51:42,293
Speaker 0: one relic from the World's Fair leads to the Space Needle

842
00:51:46,182 --> 00:51:55,216
Speaker 1: You know did a whole bunch of things but also Took you to the Space Needle and that you know, I was like, oh well If we're gonna go to the Space Needle Monday, we might as well use the monorail.

843
00:51:55,257 --> 00:51:55,960
Speaker 1: it exists, right?

844
00:51:56,761 --> 00:52:00,536
Speaker 1: So we go near that mall with the awesome food court and to get on the monorail.

845
00:52:00,757 --> 00:52:04,834
Speaker 0: first discovery Oh the monorail only goes to the Space Needle.

846
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:05,698
Speaker 0: Okay, that's cool.

847
00:52:05,979 --> 00:52:15,465
Speaker 0: Yeah Okay, so we get on the monorail for $2 right $2 Yes and I point out this is where we ran into for the I think the second time and then we finally kind of Semi-hooked up with.

848
00:52:15,485 --> 00:52:17,254
Speaker 1: there was this cool Scottish do.

849
00:52:17,355 --> 00:52:18,300
Speaker 0: awesome Scottish, dude.

Speaker 1: I think we met him around our panel and a little bit afterwards then he was staying in our hotel And we happen to bump into him a bunch of times going into the hotel.

855
00:52:44,801 --> 00:52:47,380
Speaker 1: He also stuck around Monday to do tourism.

856
00:52:47,741 --> 00:52:56,517
Speaker 0: So we were sticking with him Monday doing terrorism and it was great because basically at one point we're talking about politics and he was not in any way shy about his political views.

857
00:52:56,979 --> 00:53:00,782
Speaker 0: and Basically, he was like, yeah, he hates the Bush administration He hates.

858
00:53:01,143 --> 00:53:05,660
Speaker 0: he was the complain ability's like yeah, but I can't complain because Tony Blair was just as much as a cock up.

859
00:53:06,966 --> 00:53:08,674
Speaker 0: But then we start with like.

860
00:53:08,874 --> 00:53:10,020
Speaker 0: he was like, how did this happen?

861
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:16,945

862
00:53:17,086 --> 00:53:18,793
Speaker 1: You're sort of like, oh, that's how it works.

Speaker 0: He was really interested.

865
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:23,920
Speaker 0: Then he started telling us about Scotland and it was also really interesting.

866
00:53:24,001 --> 00:53:28,449
Speaker 0: So dude, I don't think we're gonna mention you again But you were totally cool.

00:53:48,001 --> 00:53:50,428
Speaker 0: So one monorail, you know monorail.

873
00:53:50,508 --> 00:53:50,889
Speaker 0: What's that?

874
00:53:50,969 --> 00:53:51,912
Speaker 0: Monorail, right?

875
00:53:52,394 --> 00:53:54,640
Speaker 1: This monorail was pretty lame.

876
00:53:54,721 --> 00:53:56,414
Speaker 1: I don't remember the monorail trip.

877
00:53:56,454 --> 00:53:57,140
Speaker 1: It was so quick.

878
00:53:57,281 --> 00:54:01,018
Speaker 0: I do I actually got a really good view of the place the way we walked back.

879
00:54:01,058 --> 00:54:01,939
Speaker 0: basically Here's the deal.

880
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,900
Speaker 0: So we get off the monorail and it felt like it was going real fast.

881
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,760
Speaker 0: We get pretty far and we're all right space needle, but let's just come back to the monorail.

882
00:54:09,342 --> 00:54:14,460
Speaker 0: So I see the space needle and first off, you know, this is definitely rim the turtles coming out.

883
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:17,740
Speaker 0: But scholars the same way and I think a lot of people have never been to Seattle.

884
00:54:18,362 --> 00:54:24,060
Speaker 0: Every depiction of Seattle is that the the space needle is like this looming edifice.

885
00:54:24,181 --> 00:54:26,500
Speaker 1: I mean the Seattle supersonics no longer exist.

886
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:32,500
Speaker 1: They just moved to Oklahoma City, but their logo right the space needle had a prominent position on their logo.

887
00:54:33,002 --> 00:54:37,279
Speaker 1: It's like a part of the skyline in every depiction of Seattle every illustration, right?

888
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:43,111
Speaker 1: I mean when the Empire State Building is part of the New York skyline Frazier crane the Seattle thinking like it's big.

889
00:54:43,171 --> 00:54:47,147
Speaker 0: it's there when we got to Seattle I didn't see it at all.

890
00:54:47,608 --> 00:54:49,274
Speaker 0: And eventually I was like, where is it?

891
00:54:49,555 --> 00:54:52,028
Speaker 0: locals were like, oh, no, no It's just really far away.

892
00:54:52,048 --> 00:54:53,480
Speaker 0: It's big if you're over there.

893
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:58,040
Speaker 0: So we finally get there and I'm not making fun of you Seattle because I think the space needle is awesome.

894
00:54:58,682 --> 00:55:00,829
Speaker 1: I mean, basically it's.

895
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:04,140
Speaker 1: I mean we have our World's Fair shit in New York and we let it rust.

896
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,829
Speaker 1: So mad props to you for not letting it rust.

897
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:09,316
Speaker 1: but it's not that tall.

898
00:55:09,377 --> 00:55:10,019
Speaker 1: It's only 500 feet.

899
00:55:10,763 --> 00:55:12,780
Speaker 0: I've been on roller coasters that weren't that much smaller than that.

900
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:14,988
Speaker 0: Well, no, it's 500 and it's 600 feet tall, but you can only get 500 feet up.

901
00:55:15,008 --> 00:55:15,109
Speaker 0: Okay.

902
00:55:15,149 --> 00:55:22,780
Speaker 0: All right All right, even so that one dude, it's not that speed up because he has to climb out there and change that light bulb.

903
00:55:23,124 --> 00:55:24,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was that was pretty cool.

904
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:32,750
Speaker 1: There is a cool fun facts about the Space Needle and it's a pretty cool structure and you know, it's not that bad But it's not that impressive either.

905
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:34,195
Speaker 1: I mean I paid $15 to go up at once.

906
00:55:35,901 --> 00:55:37,848
Speaker 1: I'll never pay $15 to go up it again.

907
00:55:38,551 --> 00:55:41,140
Speaker 1: Let me just say that much and I was sort of disappointed.

908
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:47,740
Speaker 1: There's a revolving restaurant in a Space Needle that we didn't eat at cuz it was ultra overpriced like quadruple the price of normal food.

909
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:48,984
Speaker 0: It didn't look that good either.

910
00:55:49,024 --> 00:55:56,393
Speaker 0: but for anyone who thinks that the Space Needle rotates and then you can sit in the restaurant No, the restaurant floor rotates.

911
00:55:56,454 --> 00:55:57,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was disappointed by that.

912
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:02,160
Speaker 1: I thought at least like one floor or like one section of the needle rotated.

913
00:56:02,541 --> 00:56:05,091
Speaker 1: But no, it's just the floor in this one restaurant rotates in it.

914
00:56:05,592 --> 00:56:06,716
Speaker 1: I was saddened by that, too.

915
00:56:07,299 --> 00:56:10,305
Speaker 0: Okay I've read the Wikipedia here.

916
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:14,680
Speaker 0: I gotta read this because obviously someone is messing with Wikipedia Space Needle Wikipedia.

917
00:56:15,681 --> 00:56:19,094
Speaker 0: Three people have committed suicide by leaping from the Space Needle's observation platform.

918
00:56:19,154 --> 00:56:19,676
Speaker 1: How could you?

919
00:56:19,696 --> 00:56:23,214
Speaker 1: they had so many wires I couldn't even get out if I wanted to blah blah blah.

920
00:56:23,536 --> 00:56:27,737
Speaker 0: two of them jumped in 1974 before a safety grid was installed around the platform.

921
00:56:27,877 --> 00:56:31,314
Speaker 0: Okay now I'm sad because the safety grid was kind of annoying and it was a little bit.

922
00:56:31,374 --> 00:56:32,439
Speaker 1: It made it hard to take pictures.

923
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:35,158
Speaker 0: Blah blah blah blah blah now.

924
00:56:35,218 --> 00:56:39,400
Speaker 0: No Tell me if you can figure out when Wikipedia is being gamed.

925
00:56:40,122 --> 00:56:52,520
Speaker 0: The only known person to survive and jump from the Space Needle was Alexander Gucci a student from Canada Who afterwards ate a 72-ounce steak in 15 minutes and walked around on his hands for three days.

926
00:56:56,342 --> 00:56:57,879
Speaker 0: Okay, there's a citation.

927
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:01,826
Speaker 0: Talk I'm gonna follow.

928
00:57:01,846 --> 00:57:03,914
Speaker 1: this thing is the real deal it could be.

929
00:57:03,994 --> 00:57:05,219
Speaker 0: anyway the citation doesn't go.

930
00:57:06,261 --> 00:57:07,431
Speaker 0: Alright, you keep talking.

931
00:57:07,451 --> 00:57:17,233
Speaker 1: I'm reading this citation here So the Space Needle us, you know You got a good view from there because everything around it was sort of low down Meanwhile mean going around is a Space Needle was you know a park?

932
00:57:17,273 --> 00:57:19,100
Speaker 1: because there was a World's Fair there at one point.

933
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:28,639
Speaker 1: so there was still a park there and The park had this sort of Bumbershoot music festival going on Which is pretty popular and there were a lot of people hanging out going in.

934
00:57:29,101 --> 00:57:30,125
Speaker 1: We thought about going in.

935
00:57:30,145 --> 00:57:33,860
Speaker 1: it would have cost us 40 bucks to get in there if we didn't have to fly out that night.

936
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,620
Speaker 0: We totally would have stayed and seen some popular music concerts, right?

937
00:57:36,861 --> 00:57:43,939
Speaker 1: But you know, I didn't know any of the bands and I wasn't too interested and I you know I only had one day there before we had to go home that night.

938
00:57:44,442 --> 00:57:48,460
Speaker 1: So we didn't go in but we saw what was going on from up above and it looked like a pretty happening.

939
00:57:48,922 --> 00:57:52,196
Speaker 1: You know the citations a lollapalooza kind of music festival.

940
00:57:52,236 --> 00:57:53,160
Speaker 0: I realized something though.

941
00:57:53,442 --> 00:57:55,879
Speaker 0: We could have just gone up the Space Needle because it's right there.

942
00:57:56,301 --> 00:58:00,040
Speaker 0: We could have totally seen the concerts and heard them pretty well from the Space Needle.

943
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:06,449
Speaker 1: Yeah There was one concert going on the main stage and we could hear it kind of okay from up there and the main you pay To get up the Space Needle.

944
00:58:06,489 --> 00:58:08,382
Speaker 1: You can stay up there till it closes It's not?

945
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:13,748
Speaker 1: you just pay a price to get up and it's free to stay there and go down when the main stage is like Right there.

946
00:58:13,829 --> 00:58:15,080
Speaker 0: It's like you could easily listen.

947
00:58:15,222 --> 00:58:23,272
Speaker 0: But uh, you know I think the Space Needle is awesome because I like it when people take things that are old and cool like World's Fair stuff and just keep it around.

948
00:58:23,697 --> 00:58:31,517
Speaker 0: but we get to the top and I look out and I see where we got on the stupid monorail.

949
00:58:31,577 --> 00:58:32,360
Speaker 0: It's right there.

950
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:35,499
Speaker 0: We could have walked in in like 15 minutes, maybe 10 minutes.

951
00:58:35,981 --> 00:58:41,014
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the monorail is for stupid really lazy people and it's sort of useless.

952
00:58:41,315 --> 00:58:49,907
Speaker 0: it was right there Like and then you know at the top and the Scottish guys like you couldn't walk there Referring to this high school at the top.

953
00:58:49,927 --> 00:58:52,880
Speaker 0: I think Queen Anne's Hill, but you could totally walk there.

954
00:58:53,101 --> 00:58:54,327
Speaker 0: You can walk like everywhere.

955
00:58:54,347 --> 00:58:55,191
Speaker 0: It was all right there.

956
00:58:55,492 --> 00:58:57,020
Speaker 1: Yeah pretty much for the Space Needle.

957
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:02,000
Speaker 1: We can see all the different parts of Seattle and to most of them We could have walked easily.

958
00:59:02,442 --> 00:59:02,944
Speaker 1: Like you.

959
00:59:02,964 --> 00:59:10,340
Speaker 1: look at the Queen Anne's Hill with this fancy building at the top and I look at it And it looks like it's pretty steep hill and I guess it is kind of steep, but then we walk down.

960
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,865
Speaker 1: I look I look closer at it.

961
00:59:12,026 --> 00:59:13,732
Speaker 1: It's four city blocks tall.

962
00:59:13,912 --> 00:59:14,354
Speaker 1: That's it.

963
00:59:14,495 --> 00:59:16,060
Speaker 1: It's just four city blocks up the hill.

964
00:59:16,201 --> 00:59:16,543
Speaker 1: That's it.

965
00:59:16,724 --> 00:59:19,159
Speaker 0: So we know we walked to the base of it and we could have just walked up.

966
00:59:19,842 --> 00:59:24,277
Speaker 1: I didn't want to walk up because I really didn't want to walk around where people's houses are.

967
00:59:24,297 --> 00:59:27,550
Speaker 0: I kind of did I wanted to see but Scott wanted to see people's houses.

968
00:59:27,691 --> 00:59:29,077
Speaker 0: I wanted to walk around the different neighborhoods.

969
00:59:29,097 --> 00:59:29,720
Speaker 0: get a feel for it.

970
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:30,658
Speaker 1: It's just people's houses.

971
00:59:31,421 --> 00:59:36,700
Speaker 1: I can understand walking around, you know, non Maine neighborhoods, but not just residential neighborhoods.

972
00:59:37,041 --> 00:59:42,480
Speaker 0: I had a lot of fun walking around New York City just random places like through the brownstones and things but those aren't.

973
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,309
Speaker 1: You know, it depends where you are.

974
00:59:44,329 --> 00:59:54,350
Speaker 1: a lot of the places in New York, you know There's always stuff at the bottom even though it's residential up top not in the midst of like the brownstones in Brooklyn Yeah, anyway, which I've wandered around because I think they're cool.

975
00:59:54,751 --> 01:00:02,002
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway, we walked around Scott looking Scott's flicker I don't know if you uploaded yet, but we took pictures of all the kind of cool and weird stuff We saw.

976
01:00:02,042 --> 01:00:03,688
Speaker 0: we found this awesome donut place.

977
01:00:03,789 --> 01:00:05,395
Speaker 1: Well, we went to up before you're getting ahead.

978
01:00:05,415 --> 01:00:06,540
Speaker 1: He went to the sci-fi museum.

979
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:09,880
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, we should probably save that for a separate show cuz we're already going on kind of long.

980
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:11,205
Speaker 1: Oh, do you want to say we're separate show?

981
01:00:11,406 --> 01:00:11,868
Speaker 0: I think we should.

982
01:00:11,888 --> 01:00:12,510
Speaker 0: there's a Monday.

983
01:00:12,771 --> 01:00:13,073
Speaker 0: Basically.

984
01:00:13,093 --> 01:00:15,161
Speaker 1: There's a sci-fi museum and it's okay It's.

985
01:00:15,543 --> 01:00:19,740
Speaker 1: I heard bad things about it, but we went anyway because we're kind of unjustified.

986
01:00:19,921 --> 01:00:23,600
Speaker 1: I mean, it wasn't super amazing, but I had some good stuff that was worth seeing.

987
01:00:23,841 --> 01:00:26,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, there were some really neat artifacts in there including a Death Star.

988
01:00:27,321 --> 01:00:31,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean museum wise it, you know has it definitely had some negatives.

989
01:00:31,801 --> 01:00:42,260
Speaker 1: But actually there was this temporary exhibit temporary meaning like six months about you know They had a bunch of toy robots and I was liking that action, but I enjoyed it and we'll talk about it some Monday.

990
01:00:42,541 --> 01:00:44,167
Speaker 1: All right, but you know we wanted around.

991
01:00:44,649 --> 01:00:48,103
Speaker 0: all I want to say about this donut place is oh my god She's one of them.

992
01:00:48,183 --> 01:00:51,540
Speaker 0: one of those needs to be in New York City and that donut place had more.

993
01:00:51,944 --> 01:00:53,220
Speaker 1: Fill up your shelf with books.

994
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:55,248
Speaker 1: You're never gonna read books that I've ever seen.

995
01:00:55,289 --> 01:00:58,040
Speaker 1: in one place at a time even more than like big furniture stores.

996
01:00:58,140 --> 01:00:59,589
Speaker 0: They had real donuts.

997
01:00:59,891 --> 01:01:00,555
Speaker 0: Hey, we're not.

998
01:01:00,595 --> 01:01:03,965
Speaker 1: Krispy Kremes Cinnamon sugar blueberry donut.

999
01:01:04,908 --> 01:01:06,914
Speaker 0: I had a real sour cream dough.

1000
01:01:06,954 --> 01:01:14,840
Speaker 1: It was like a blueberry muffin, but donut Yeah with cinnamon sugar, you know, we wandered around saw a bunch of other weird stuff and it's not this place.

1001
01:01:14,941 --> 01:01:16,851
Speaker 1: It was like Wexley school for girls.

1002
01:01:16,912 --> 01:01:17,575
Speaker 1: I don't know what it is.

1003
01:01:17,636 --> 01:01:18,139
Speaker 1: I should look it up.

1004
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,680
Speaker 0: I kept meaning to yeah, we didn't look it up, but we took a picture of it.

1005
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:22,325
Speaker 0: It was so weird.

1006
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:24,039
Speaker 0: We were trying to figure out what it was.

1007
01:01:24,682 --> 01:01:25,624
Speaker 1: I'm looking it up right now.

1008
01:01:25,684 --> 01:01:28,031
Speaker 1: Wexley school for girls based in Seattle is.

1009
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:29,395
Speaker 1: there's a flash loading.

1010
01:01:29,997 --> 01:01:32,549
Speaker 0: flash loading Hold on.

1011
01:01:33,137 --> 01:01:41,184
Speaker 0: All right but one thing I'll say well see how it talks about that is that Seattle is really vertical like not in terms of buildings or anything cuz there weren't that many skyscrapers and things.

1012
01:01:41,244 --> 01:01:49,800
Speaker 0: but in that like all the parks we went to were they were more like terrace gardens and like Everything was multi-leveled and you'd enter and exit buildings on different floors.

1013
01:01:49,921 --> 01:01:54,492
Speaker 0: It was kind of cool that way cuz you know It's built like there's hills about and there's steep streets and things.

1014
01:01:54,553 --> 01:02:02,154
Speaker 0: but winding through all this parks Really made clear the fact that parkour is real big in Seattle.

1015
01:02:02,194 --> 01:02:07,571
Speaker 0: And in fact one of the cool dudes in the Asian posse Really into parkour is like in this parkour club.

1016
01:02:08,233 --> 01:02:13,590
Speaker 0: and I was thinking alright I guess Seattle's where the cool parkour people are now.

1017
01:02:13,691 --> 01:02:19,007
Speaker 0: I know why you walk around any park in Seattle and you're like, oh Shit here's where the parkour be.

1018
01:02:19,108 --> 01:02:22,640
Speaker 0: Oh my god, if I if I were a parker dude, I could totally jump over that.

1019
01:02:22,721 --> 01:02:31,916
Speaker 1: Yeah, dad I know I didn't was listening to you because I was reading about the Wexley school for girls, which is just a Really awesome and quirky marketing agency.

1020
01:02:31,936 --> 01:02:35,500
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, but I guess it worked.

1021
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:58,860
Speaker 1: There was this awesome park attached to the convention center that went like all the way down the highway And it was pretty big, you know relative to Seattle, you know, it's like multiple city blocks and it Basically was all these ups and downs and lefts and rights and circles and benches and concrete and trees and it was really kind Of funky and definitely, you know the kind of place where you can go and film a wicked movie and do some parkour.

1022
01:02:59,221 --> 01:03:00,485
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we wanted around there.

1023
01:03:00,806 --> 01:03:03,154
Speaker 0: We we kept saying how do some parkour?

1024
01:03:03,174 --> 01:03:04,137
Speaker 0: we didn't do any parkour.

1025
01:03:04,498 --> 01:03:05,652
Speaker 0: Oh my god We would have died.

1026
01:03:05,672 --> 01:03:08,853
Speaker 0: No Yeah, but die out, you know, we wanted around.

1027
01:03:08,873 --> 01:03:10,080
Speaker 0: Seattle was a pretty fun place.

1028
01:03:10,362 --> 01:03:12,639
Speaker 0: I'm stalling for time because I'm gonna end this show kind of soon.

1029
01:03:13,202 --> 01:03:14,830
Speaker 0: Talk about the game works though.

1030
01:03:14,851 --> 01:03:16,740
Speaker 0: We should review the game works on a Tuesday.

1031
01:03:17,021 --> 01:03:19,131
Speaker 1: Let me just say what I'll just tell this real quick.

1032
01:03:19,191 --> 01:03:43,075
Speaker 1: when I was younger on TV When game works was a new place I saw this story like oh my god game works, right and it was basically like we're opening up an awesome arcade in Seattle and a bunch of other places but the flagship one is in Seattle and I saw that and I was like, oh man I want to go there right and You know later on a place like Dave and Buster's opened up and Jillian's and they were sort of the restaurant arcade Places, you know, they were

1033
01:03:43,136 --> 01:03:43,499
Speaker 0: all right.

1034
01:03:44,642 --> 01:03:46,230
Speaker 1: They went downhill over time though.

1035
01:03:46,271 --> 01:03:54,340
Speaker 1: Dave and Buster's is cool got uncool You know, the VR was big back then, you know, and they showed off all sorts of laser tag and battle tag and all that business.

1036
01:03:55,144 --> 01:03:58,318
Speaker 1: So I wondered when I was going to Seattle does game work still exist?

1037
01:03:58,398 --> 01:03:59,483
Speaker 1: and yes Yes, it does.

1038
01:03:59,583 --> 01:04:02,355
Speaker 1: But it's just a Sega arcade now.

1039
01:04:02,415 --> 01:04:03,620
Speaker 1: The VR is gone.

1040
01:04:04,062 --> 01:04:07,560
Speaker 1: It's pretty much just a sports bar and a bunch of arcade games.

1041
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:11,816
Speaker 1: But the prices on the games are reasonable unlike Dave and Buster's and Jillian's.

1042
01:04:11,836 --> 01:04:26,080
Speaker 1: Every game fifty cents Yeah, and they had you know, like indie racing to the big indie racing machine, which is wicked old-school But wicked awesome now despite the fact that I've only ever played it, you know once before at Epcot Center in Disney World.

1043
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:26,862
Speaker 0: Well, here we'll sum it up.

1044
01:04:27,404 --> 01:04:34,826
Speaker 0: It was the best arcade I've walked into in like nine years, but it was still And not the greatest.

1045
01:04:34,966 --> 01:04:39,580
Speaker 1: yeah had many flaws, but it was better than any arcade I've been to in a long time.

1046
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:43,049
Speaker 1: They actually had the f-zero game, even though it was somewhat broken.

1047
01:04:43,490 --> 01:04:44,332
Speaker 1: They had initial d4.

1048
01:04:44,633 --> 01:04:44,893
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

1049
01:04:45,555 --> 01:04:52,456
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah They had three DDRs, but the only good one was a supernova which it wasn't even that good.

1050
01:04:52,476 --> 01:04:58,392
Speaker 1: They had the The the newest version the ninth version of the the drumming game.

1051
01:04:58,412 --> 01:05:02,966
Speaker 1: Yes, taiko drummer taiko drum master super fun to play On the right drum.

1052
01:05:03,046 --> 01:05:04,452
Speaker 1: One of the sensors is a little broken.

1053
01:05:04,472 --> 01:05:06,299
Speaker 0: Yeah, we were playing that with some other packs.

1054
01:05:06,339 --> 01:05:07,184
Speaker 0: guy We ran into.

1055
01:05:07,204 --> 01:05:09,879
Speaker 1: yeah, I finally figured out how to play it and I'm actually kind of good at it.

1056
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:12,792
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got up to the high did the hardest song in the highest difficulty.

1057
01:05:12,832 --> 01:05:13,836
Speaker 0: I played the hurry theme.

1058
01:05:13,856 --> 01:05:14,660
Speaker 1: That's how I knew it was.

1059
01:05:14,843 --> 01:05:21,459
Speaker 1: Yeah They had classic games, you know, they had really bad air hockey to use multiple pucks.

1060
01:05:21,519 --> 01:05:22,261
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah There's a point.

1061
01:05:22,281 --> 01:05:26,797
Speaker 0: there were like five pucks out and we each had two paddles and the giant goal.

1062
01:05:26,877 --> 01:05:27,800
Speaker 1: It was really bad.

1063
01:05:28,623 --> 01:05:31,516
Speaker 0: I point out I won by like 18.

1064
01:05:31,516 --> 01:05:34,506
Speaker 0: It was really bad Yeah, but I point out that bad or not.

1065
01:05:34,606 --> 01:05:35,790
Speaker 0: I won anyway.

1066
01:05:35,830 --> 01:05:40,427
Speaker 1: important thing is that I what happened to this doesn't mean shit Cuz it's such a bad air hockey.

1067
01:05:40,507 --> 01:05:42,276
Speaker 0: unless I win then it means you win.

1068
01:05:42,296 --> 01:05:43,080
Speaker 1: It's only a means.

1069
01:05:45,682 --> 01:05:49,760
Speaker 0: But one thing I don't want to talk about all the restaurants I was playing for serious because it didn't matter.

1070
01:05:50,164 --> 01:05:56,638
Speaker 0: Well, one thing I want to talk about is that you know We kept kind of just randomly picking restaurants and some were good and some were mediocre, but whatever somewhere,

1071
01:05:56,658 --> 01:06:01,900
Speaker 1: you know Some were good, but they were overpriced, you know, like we ate at one place the Daily Grill and it was okay.

1072
01:06:02,061 --> 01:06:04,009
Speaker 1: It was good food, but paid too much for it.

1073
01:06:04,169 --> 01:06:06,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean cuz at one point I was eating there.

1074
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:14,980
Speaker 0: Then I suddenly thought you know for like seven bucks at the Alumni Grill I could have a burger with cheese sticks and onion rings instead of cheese.

1075
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like you got a burger for the Daily Grill and you know, it's like what 20 bucks something like that.

1076
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:24,035
Speaker 1: But for seven bucks at the Alumni Grill in Wildwood, New Jersey, you could have had all man's.

1077
01:06:24,497 --> 01:06:33,240
Speaker 0: but at the same time You know, finally we're like, all right and instead of trying to use a food thing or a website or just winging it People on Twitter apparently kept talking about Vons.

1078
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:40,126
Speaker 1: Well, I think a couple of people mentioned Vons and I saw Vons and we tried to eat there once and the dining room was Closed for the night because it was late.

1079
01:06:40,447 --> 01:06:43,220
Speaker 1: So we ate there on Labor Day during the happy hour.

1080
01:06:43,621 --> 01:06:48,940
Speaker 0: I you know, maybe just because of my life, but I've never actually been in a bar during a happy hour.

1081
01:06:49,344 --> 01:06:50,539
Speaker 0: They had this big wheel, right?

1082
01:06:50,781 --> 01:06:55,417
Speaker 0: So we're sitting directly under the wheel and they say first of all, seat yourself.

1083
01:06:56,079 --> 01:07:03,191
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, and all I'm gonna say is I ordered like This was one of the biggest pieces of meat I've ever eaten.

1084
01:07:03,794 --> 01:07:05,420
Speaker 0: It was a gigantic prime rib.

1085
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:09,413
Speaker 1: It was I ordered the special that you could only order on Monday night and it was.

1086
01:07:09,554 --> 01:07:09,714
Speaker 1: it was.

1087
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:10,898
Speaker 1: it was Monday afternoon.

1088
01:07:10,959 --> 01:07:13,206
Speaker 1: ish I got these like beef ribs.

1089
01:07:13,427 --> 01:07:14,129
Speaker 1: Oh my gosh.

1090
01:07:14,169 --> 01:07:14,490
Speaker 0: This was.

1091
01:07:14,791 --> 01:07:17,500
Speaker 0: I would say that this is probably finish the final rib.

1092
01:07:17,862 --> 01:07:20,376
Speaker 0: It was probably you get the prime rib third or it was.

1093
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:23,119
Speaker 0: I got some cooked properly.

1094
01:07:23,521 --> 01:07:29,078
Speaker 0: Prime rib on a big piece of bread on a giant piece of fried cornbread.

1095
01:07:29,098 --> 01:07:31,766
Speaker 0: Ah Yes, and the cornbread?

1096
01:07:31,826 --> 01:07:39,254
Speaker 0: by the time I finished the steak was filled with fat and grease And oh my god, it was.

1097
01:07:39,616 --> 01:07:40,400
Speaker 0: it was like 30 bucks.

1098
01:07:41,564 --> 01:07:44,775
Speaker 1: It was expensive, but it wasn't nearly as expensive as some of the other ones.

1099
01:07:44,815 --> 01:07:46,260
Speaker 1: in terms of dollar per value.

1100
01:07:46,421 --> 01:07:49,514
Speaker 0: It was totally the third or fourth best prime rib I've ever eaten.

1101
01:07:49,674 --> 01:07:50,016
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was.

1102
01:07:50,096 --> 01:07:51,080
Speaker 1: it was really damn good.

1103
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:55,900
Speaker 1: It was like the best food ever eaten, but I would totally eat there again for maybe two meals next time we go.

1104
01:07:55,940 --> 01:07:58,591
Speaker 0: I wanted a root beer that had some boutique root beer on tap.

1105
01:07:58,651 --> 01:07:59,535
Speaker 0: It was fantastic.

1106
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:00,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got a lemonade.

1107
01:08:00,981 --> 01:08:01,563
Speaker 1: It's pretty good.

1108
01:08:01,583 --> 01:08:05,580
Speaker 0: And then I got to say this so we're sitting there and then you know happy hour or whatever.

1109
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:11,100
Speaker 1: They spin the wheel and the wheel basically has different drinks on all the different spots.

1110
01:08:11,181 --> 01:08:17,120
Speaker 1: So it might come up on like, you know You know like $4 Grey Goose whatever.

1111
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:19,104
Speaker 1: Yeah so that means that everyone can.

1112
01:08:19,225 --> 01:08:22,738
Speaker 1: if you want you can order that for $4 which is less than the normal price.

1113
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:31,439
Speaker 1: or it might Come up at like Bartenders choice or it might come up at choice of table 401 and then whoever's sitting at table 401 gets to pick.

1114
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:33,796
Speaker 0: now I didn't really care and I was like, alright, whatever.

1115
01:08:33,836 --> 01:08:34,340
Speaker 0: It's happy hour.

1116
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:41,171
Speaker 0: I don't want to drink like whatever kind of shots the frat boys drink But it happened to land on the Manhattan my favorite drink.

1117
01:08:41,192 --> 01:08:43,140
Speaker 0: It was like makers something man It was.

1118
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:44,687
Speaker 0: it was a Manhattan with makers mark.

1119
01:08:45,290 --> 01:08:47,660
Speaker 0: now lately, you know a non from Apple geeks.

1120
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,080
Speaker 0: No, I I like a Manhattan.

1121
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:52,840
Speaker 0: I like whiskey and that sort of thing and I drunk a whole bunch of different whiskeys.

1122
01:08:52,961 --> 01:08:55,979
Speaker 0: I never really paid attention, but he turned me on to Jameson.

1123
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:57,432
Speaker 0: I've been a Jameson man ever since.

1124
01:08:57,513 --> 01:08:58,359
Speaker 0: Jameson is my favorite.

1125
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:04,255
Speaker 0: Oh my actually knew about Jameson cuz I saw ads for it in the subway But he turned me on to it in a big way.

1126
01:09:04,274 --> 01:09:13,000
Speaker 0: So For the first time in a long time I decide, you know, alright, it's 250 I'll order the stew in Manhattan with maker's mark, whatever.

1127
01:09:13,901 --> 01:09:15,305
Speaker 0: Let me tell you the food was good.

1128
01:09:15,866 --> 01:09:17,390
Speaker 0: That was a terrible Manhattan.

1129
01:09:17,671 --> 01:09:19,957
Speaker 0: Yeah maker's mark is ass.

1130
01:09:20,138 --> 01:09:22,947
Speaker 0: Oh my god I barely finished the stupid thing.

1131
01:09:23,006 --> 01:09:26,680
Speaker 0: I choked it down grudgingly because I wasn't gonna give up my whiskey.

1132
01:09:27,042 --> 01:09:27,826
Speaker 1: Yeah, it didn't.

1133
01:09:27,946 --> 01:09:30,459
Speaker 1: it seemed like they had a good selection of alcohols.

1134
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:32,158
Speaker 1: They did but not that what I would know.

1135
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:41,580
Speaker 1: But it seemed like a lot of their alcohols were get drunk variety not like that other place that the tap house Have the fancy beer variety.

1136
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:45,051
Speaker 0: Alright, you want to learn about packs and I followed up with this online.

1137
01:09:45,792 --> 01:09:55,148
Speaker 0: of the beer houses around packs Pretty much all of them ran out of almost all of their interesting beers Because of packs.

1138
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:56,676
Speaker 0: awesome you go in pretty much.

1139
01:09:56,737 --> 01:09:59,004
Speaker 0: it was the cool thing You know, we're talking about everywhere you went packs.

1140
01:09:59,486 --> 01:10:02,193
Speaker 0: you go to any restaurant anywhere packs.

1141
01:10:02,233 --> 01:10:04,860
Speaker 0: people go to a bar a grill all night long.

1142
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:16,440
Speaker 1: It's like all packs people and like one businessman going what the fuck dude, no It's pretty nice that we could get into anywhere shorts and a t-shirt But we didn't try to eat at the Capitol Grill or the Ruth Chris.

1143
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:20,920
Speaker 0: So there's a Capitol Grill at a Ruth Chris like all over the place exactly gonna eat.

1144
01:10:21,161 --> 01:10:23,611
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, a lot of you went to like the cheesecake.

1145
01:10:23,711 --> 01:10:29,332
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like those places are good When you don't have another choice, it's like, okay, there's nowhere to eat.

1146
01:10:29,854 --> 01:10:31,560
Speaker 1: I know that place is safe and good.

1147
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:33,350
Speaker 1: It's sort of like, you know your safety net.

1148
01:10:33,672 --> 01:10:35,120
Speaker 1: it's not the place you choose to go.

1149
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:40,180
Speaker 1: I mean not that it's not awesome Capitol Grill, but you know It's a safety net because I can always eat it it whenever I want.

1150
01:10:40,341 --> 01:10:44,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, and also if you go to a city multiple times, you know, you go there like Baltimore.

1151
01:10:45,261 --> 01:10:47,794
Speaker 0: I've already eaten in a lot of the places around there and I know what's there.

1152
01:10:47,874 --> 01:10:48,960
Speaker 0: so I go there so often.

1153
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:49,824
Speaker 0: I know what's good.

1154
01:10:50,166 --> 01:10:51,191
Speaker 0: I'd make an informed choice.

1155
01:10:51,934 --> 01:10:55,430
Speaker 0: if you're in a new city Eat at the places that you can't eat anywhere else.

1156
01:10:55,652 --> 01:10:57,160
Speaker 0: go to like the weird restaurant.

1157
01:10:57,502 --> 01:10:59,792
Speaker 0: Go to the things that aren't chains or chains.

1158
01:10:59,812 --> 01:11:01,259
Speaker 0: You've never heard of in the very least.

1159
01:11:01,661 --> 01:11:03,388
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know, I could see.

1160
01:11:03,448 --> 01:11:05,075
Speaker 1: now there's a chain you never heard of.

1161
01:11:05,115 --> 01:11:06,240
Speaker 1: you'll you won't know it's a chain.

1162
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:07,340
Speaker 1: You'll think it's just a restaurant.

1163
01:11:07,481 --> 01:11:08,725
Speaker 1: Yeah, but like imagine this.

1164
01:11:08,785 --> 01:11:12,880
Speaker 1: imagine if you saw Cheesecake Factory, but you didn't know it was a chain.

1165
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:15,509
Speaker 1: You thought it was just a place called Cheesecake Factory.

1166
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:17,155
Speaker 1: That was in Seattle only.

1167
01:11:17,175 --> 01:11:23,369
Speaker 1: Oh, man Totally gone there, but because I knew it was the shit cake factory No need to go.

1168
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:31,940
Speaker 0: but I've kind of learned, you know I think I have a good appraisal of the restaurants in the in the vicinity of packs And I think I'll eat it at least one of those places again.

1169
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:35,173
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely, but we didn't need at the elephant castle.

1170
01:11:35,254 --> 01:11:35,978
Speaker 0: I kind of wanted to.

1171
01:11:35,998 --> 01:11:36,661
Speaker 1: yeah It was just.

1172
01:11:36,702 --> 01:11:39,074
Speaker 1: that was the elephant castle was the bar under our hotel.

1173
01:11:39,114 --> 01:11:41,225
Speaker 0: It looked just like a bar But the theme was great.

1174
01:11:41,245 --> 01:11:43,757
Speaker 1: It was the elephant with a castle on its back.

1175
01:11:43,777 --> 01:11:44,300
Speaker 1: It was great.

1176
01:11:44,401 --> 01:11:45,951
Speaker 0: I just like I really dug the theme.

1177
01:11:46,092 --> 01:11:47,240
Speaker 1: really good marketing on that.

1178
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:58,388
Speaker 0: So I gotta say, you know, we checked in late at night On Thursday before the con and the dude who checked us in was actually like, you know When you're doing some sort of Transaction with people in a service sector.

1179
01:11:58,950 --> 01:12:01,077
Speaker 0: most of the time it's all business like they do their thing.

1180
01:12:01,098 --> 01:12:06,403
Speaker 0: you do your thing but every now and then like the person will be funny with you and It's rare.

1181
01:12:06,463 --> 01:12:07,748
Speaker 0: and sometimes they're annoying.

1182
01:12:07,809 --> 01:12:10,700
Speaker 1: funny with you like they're trying to be funny, but they're just being annoying and stupid.

1183
01:12:10,881 --> 01:12:19,635
Speaker 0: But also sometimes like you both have to be in the mood to be funny Like if I'm not in the mood to like have banter with some stranger and he starts banter.

1184
01:12:19,695 --> 01:12:21,280
Speaker 0: It's like oh my god banter.

1185
01:12:21,881 --> 01:12:22,361
Speaker 0: Look.

1186
01:12:22,822 --> 01:12:25,326
Speaker 0: why must we go through the charade charade?

1187
01:12:25,346 --> 01:12:27,569
Speaker 0: I was quoting something Scott.

1188
01:12:27,649 --> 01:12:32,948
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah Anyway, but the confluence was right.

1189
01:12:33,871 --> 01:12:35,415
Speaker 0: I was ready for some silly talk.

1190
01:12:35,816 --> 01:12:37,380
Speaker 0: He was fishing for some silly talk.

1191
01:12:37,822 --> 01:12:39,431
Speaker 0: We had to go home.

1192
01:12:39,672 --> 01:12:41,060
Speaker 1: He just got off a plane.

1193
01:12:41,802 --> 01:12:44,748
Speaker 1: It was like the best silly talk at a hotel check-in ever.

1194
01:12:44,828 --> 01:12:52,614
Speaker 0: cuz I was like Blah blah, I'd like to check into the hotel under geek nights and the guys like well I'd like to help you with that.

1195
01:12:52,855 --> 01:12:59,686

1198
01:13:05,471 --> 01:13:09,149
Speaker 0: And he starts talking about packs and tells me all the good bars and it was a good time.

1199
01:13:10,231 --> 01:13:11,799
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know on that note.

1216
01:13:51,660 --> 01:14:00,886
Speaker 0: Yeah and he had a lot of cool things to say and I really would like to hear his impressions of burning wheel once he's tried it Cuz he's one of those knowledgeable guys who just hasn't played burning whale.

1217
01:14:01,047 --> 01:14:01,268
Speaker 1: Yep.

1218

01:14:05,484 --> 01:14:10,222
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean a lot of fun things Experience a new city through his food.

1220
01:14:10,563 --> 01:14:11,890
Speaker 0: Well, you know we there was a lot more.

1221
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:22,890
Speaker 0: I mean we walked around the city a lot Like we walked into some weird neighborhoods and some weird places like the bus terminals God was talking about totally abandoned and closed because it was a holiday.

1222
01:14:22,970 --> 01:14:30,789
Speaker 0: But like we were parent like we climbed up as high as we could and repairing down into it and it was kind of cool and artistic to see it empty like that.

1223
01:14:30,809 --> 01:14:37,688
Speaker 0: and There was this really like neat moment where the periodic PA that says things like don't leave bags unattended.

1224
01:14:37,728 --> 01:14:40,688
Speaker 0: blah blah blah Was still going but there was no one there.

1225
01:14:41,751 --> 01:14:42,393
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's freaky.

1226
01:14:42,453 --> 01:14:44,158
Speaker 1: There's also the pink elephant car wash.

1227
01:14:44,359 --> 01:14:48,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, there were also all these awesome sculptures all over the place.

1228
01:14:48,030 --> 01:14:52,690
Speaker 1: There's that gas station that had a teriyaki place in it, but the teriyaki place in the gas station was closed.

1229
01:14:52,730 --> 01:14:55,921
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was like gas station and our awesome teriyaki burgers.

1230
01:14:55,961 --> 01:14:57,266
Speaker 1: Well, we don't know it was awesome.

1231
01:14:57,366 --> 01:14:58,410
Speaker 0: They said they were awesome.

1232
01:14:58,812 --> 01:15:00,078
Speaker 1: Alright they said they're right.

1233
01:15:00,098 --> 01:15:05,686
Speaker 0: I got some Red Bull and said but yeah, yeah But you know that we did a lot of the Red Bull truck at PAX.

1234
01:15:05,807 --> 01:15:07,589
Speaker 1: Oh my god I guess they didn't want to lose money.

1235
01:15:08,351 --> 01:15:09,617
Speaker 1: Usually those things make money.

1236
01:15:09,657 --> 01:15:10,562
Speaker 0: No, no, you know what?

1237
01:15:10,904 --> 01:15:11,486
Speaker 0: They don't make money.

1238
01:15:11,506 --> 01:15:12,150
Speaker 0: They give it away.

1239
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:17,910
Speaker 0: They're not gonna be at PAX because who are they who at PAX does not drink Red Bull or already?

1240
01:15:18,071 --> 01:15:19,330
Speaker 0: No Red Bull exists and has made.

1241
01:15:20,631 --> 01:15:24,989
Speaker 1: Other energy drink was there because they're trying to be Red Bull not gonna work.

1242
01:15:25,714 --> 01:15:27,950
Speaker 0: But we did a bunch of stuff that we didn't talk about here.

1243
01:15:28,030 --> 01:15:30,020
Speaker 0: But Seattle was really cool and I'd like to go.

1244
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:31,950
Speaker 0: but well, I'm going back cuz I'll be at PAX next year.

1245
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:34,579
Speaker 1: Yeah, baby, would you go back to Seattle if there wasn't packs?

1246
01:15:35,181 --> 01:15:36,526
Speaker 1: I mean, it's a good city.

1247
01:15:36,546 --> 01:15:37,530
Speaker 1: It's not a bad city.

1248
01:15:37,691 --> 01:15:38,135
Speaker 1: It's not like.

1249
01:15:38,216 --> 01:15:39,951
Speaker 1: it's not like one of those places where I'll be like It.

1250
01:15:40,011 --> 01:15:41,679
Speaker 0: would you go back to Seattle without packs?

1251
01:15:41,699 --> 01:15:44,170
Speaker 0: is like saying would you go to see go to Chicago for no reason?

1252
01:15:44,910 --> 01:15:47,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'd been to Seattle or Chicago.

1253
01:15:47,361 --> 01:15:49,349
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna go back unless I have a reason I could.

1254
01:15:49,370 --> 01:15:55,733
Speaker 0: there There's a lot of things that could cause me to go back and I mean, I wouldn't say ah Seattle I'm not going back there.

1255
01:15:55,773 --> 01:15:59,607
Speaker 0: Like I say about much of Jersey, but yeah, Seattle's an okay place.

1256
01:15:59,668 --> 01:16:00,330
Speaker 1: It's pretty cool.

1257
01:16:00,370 --> 01:16:05,127
Speaker 1: It's nice and modern and fancy and clean and it's a good place to have a little convention.

1258
01:16:05,167 --> 01:16:10,010
Speaker 1: and it's it's pretty Convenient for walking around and the hotels are cheap and I kind of like it.

1259
01:16:10,050 --> 01:16:10,649
Speaker 1: I wouldn't live there.

1260
01:16:10,730 --> 01:16:18,861
Speaker 0: but you know we had to take a car service back to the airport because the shuttle totally sucked ass and the Hotel guy was like no dude.

1261
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:20,007
Speaker 0: The shuttle tastes like an hour.

1262
01:16:20,087 --> 01:16:26,550
Speaker 1: seriously Yeah, because it's not one of those shuttles that goes from your hotel to the airport It's a shuttle that goes to every hotel than the airport.

1263
01:16:26,931 --> 01:16:29,140
Speaker 0: so on the way back right we're in the car service.

1264
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:32,914
Speaker 0: very good sir and all the business and the guys chatty and we're Telling what we were doing.

1265
01:16:32,974 --> 01:16:36,690
Speaker 0: He's interested and we see this weird elevated thing.

1266
01:16:36,730 --> 01:16:39,270
Speaker 0: We're trying to figure out what it does and scouts like it's a monorail.

1267
01:16:39,330 --> 01:16:45,530
Speaker 0: I'm like, it can't be a monorail because why would it not go to Seattle and it from the airport?

1268
01:16:46,230 --> 01:16:47,133
Speaker 0: Where else would it go?

1269
01:16:47,153 --> 01:16:49,721
Speaker 0: And if it went to Seattle we would have taken it.

1270
01:16:49,982 --> 01:16:52,597
Speaker 0: and then we see the sign that settled the argument.

1271
01:16:52,638 --> 01:16:56,403
Speaker 0: it says Light rail to Seattle from Airport coming 2009.

1272
01:16:56,403 --> 01:17:01,509
Speaker 1: We're like, oh So I guess car service guys gonna be in trouble next year?

1273
01:17:01,872 --> 01:17:04,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I'm gonna take that monorail whatever it is light rail.

1274
01:17:05,719 --> 01:17:11,310
Speaker 0: so we took the Late night flight home and we got back to New York City after a fitful sleep.

1275
01:17:11,451 --> 01:17:12,438
Speaker 1: It was 6 a.m.

1276
01:17:12,498 --> 01:17:13,404
Speaker 1: New York time.

1277
01:17:13,646 --> 01:17:14,250
Speaker 1: We got there.

1278
01:17:14,451 --> 01:17:18,010
Speaker 0: So, you know, there's this place and I'm gonna end on this in New York City.

1279
01:17:18,090 --> 01:17:22,510
Speaker 0: It's if you go out of the 42nd Street entrance under Pershing Square from Grand Central.

1280
01:17:23,012 --> 01:17:26,223
Speaker 0: It's called either the central cafe or the Pershing Square cafe.

1281
01:17:26,664 --> 01:17:30,739
Speaker 0: Don't even square central cafe Don't don't even try to figure it out.

1282
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:31,542
Speaker 0: You see it.

1283
01:17:31,602 --> 01:17:34,877
Speaker 0: It's right there and I've eaten there for dinner.

1284
01:17:35,239 --> 01:17:36,164
Speaker 0: I've eaten there for lunch.

1285
01:17:36,505 --> 01:17:37,370
Speaker 1: I don't eat there for lunch.

1286
01:17:37,410 --> 01:17:39,062
Speaker 1: I never dinner twice and it was really good.

1287
01:17:39,082 --> 01:17:40,250
Speaker 0: The dinner is really really good.

1288
01:17:40,571 --> 01:17:46,630
Speaker 0: The lunch is also really really good and we always see they have this sign New York's best and busiest breakfast.

1289
01:17:46,871 --> 01:17:54,637
Speaker 1: And yes, like I always saw the sign outside this place and I used to always think oh man, that's the place I got to eat breakfast there sometime.

1290
01:17:54,657 --> 01:17:55,260
Speaker 1: It's like man.

1291
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:59,320
Speaker 0: I want to pay money to get like a really good breakfast Like this could be cool someday.

1292
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:11,724
Speaker 0: I'll eat the breakfast there someday someday The those Tuesday after packs was that day we go in we sit down But they're kind of early and it's weird because it was a work day.

1293
01:18:12,307 --> 01:18:14,276
Speaker 0: on a normal work day I would have already been at work.

1294
01:18:14,577 --> 01:18:19,738
Speaker 0: In fact, I was sitting right next to the building I work in but I was not working at it that day.

1295
01:18:19,758 --> 01:18:27,719
Speaker 0: Mmm, and you know, we get seated and we get the menu Really shit menu uninspiring crap.

1296
01:18:27,759 --> 01:18:32,972
Speaker 0: It's like the menu that a crappy little diner has but I think yeah It's not like you know I've had.

1297
01:18:33,193 --> 01:18:38,189
Speaker 1: the best breakfast ever had was at a place called Leo's which has changed his name to Kings in Connecticut.

1298
01:18:38,290 --> 01:18:46,570
Speaker 1: in I think is I think it's technically Newtown, Connecticut And when it was called Leo's this guy owned it and you could go in there and order the wheel of fortune.

1299
01:18:47,172 --> 01:18:49,158
Speaker 1: Let me explain to you the wheel of fortune.

1300
01:18:49,178 --> 01:18:49,861
Speaker 1: Are you ready for this?

1301
01:18:50,463 --> 01:18:52,730
Speaker 1: Cuz it puts the tremendous 12 to shame.

1302
01:18:53,234 --> 01:19:03,943
Speaker 1: we were talking about a combination of waffles pancakes French toast eggs bacon sausage Bananas mixed berries whipped cream and a cherry on top.

1303
01:19:04,043 --> 01:19:06,310
Speaker 1: Oh my shit for less than $20.

1304
01:19:06,310 --> 01:19:12,090
Speaker 0: Alright now is the thing but I was thinking alright benefit of the doubt the lunch and dinner menus are both very sparse.

1305
01:19:12,170 --> 01:19:14,585
Speaker 0: They have very few but very well put together things.

1306
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:24,398
Speaker 0: I'm thinking alright Maybe these are just you know Like the the the best of these kinds of breakfast and outside they actually had a sign like famous pancakes famous.

1307
01:19:24,921 --> 01:19:29,699
Speaker 0: so uh That was one of the worst breakfast I've ever had.

1308
01:19:29,739 --> 01:19:30,341
Speaker 0: it was terrible.

1309
01:19:30,421 --> 01:19:31,404
Speaker 0: I didn't even leave a tip.

1310
01:19:31,485 --> 01:19:33,110
Speaker 0: it was so not good.

1311
01:19:33,312 --> 01:19:35,430
Speaker 1: I mean, I ordered a banana pancakes, right?

1312
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:40,076
Speaker 1: It was basically three pancakes three syrup undercooked pancakes.

1313
01:19:40,116 --> 01:19:41,338
Speaker 1: They were slightly undercooked.

1314
01:19:41,478 --> 01:19:44,942
Speaker 1: It's in some parts of them and there was like.

1315
01:19:47,469 --> 01:19:48,535
Speaker 1: I Don't even know they were.

1316
01:19:48,575 --> 01:19:50,684
Speaker 1: so not that the banana right?

1317
01:19:50,765 --> 01:19:54,065
Speaker 1: I ordered a banana pancakes I expect like a mountain of bananas and whipped cream.

1318
01:19:54,105 --> 01:19:54,770
Speaker 1: on the pancakes.

1319
01:19:55,452 --> 01:20:02,031
Speaker 1: it's like they took a quarter of a banana and sliced it up and put it on the side and that cost me a dollar a Dollar.

1320
01:20:02,453 --> 01:20:06,690
Speaker 1: and for a quarter of a banana sliced up on the side the eggs were mushy.

1321
01:20:06,790 --> 01:20:07,533
Speaker 0: The toast was we.

1322
01:20:07,573 --> 01:20:07,794
Speaker 0: it was.

1323
01:20:08,235 --> 01:20:09,781
Speaker 0: it was like the breakfast that I would.

1324
01:20:09,821 --> 01:20:15,125
Speaker 0: I would have been happy if I had paid like five Bucks for that at a diner in the middle of nowhere.

1325
01:20:15,225 --> 01:20:16,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, that would have been good.

1326
01:20:16,331 --> 01:20:21,250
Speaker 0: So I'm just gonna say this right now never eat breakfast at that godforsaken place.

01:20:21,492 --> 01:20:22,883
Speaker 0: That was that like the dinner there.

Speaker 1: eat dinner there But that was.

1329
01:20:24,393 --> 01:20:27,870
Speaker 0: you know what though because the breakfast is so bad despite how much they hype it up.

Speaker 1: You want to.

1331
01:20:28,393 --> 01:20:30,950

1332
01:20:31,191 --> 01:20:33,724
Speaker 1: I mean the dinner is good, but I do feel like you could.

1333
