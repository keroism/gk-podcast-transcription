1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,039
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, November 1st 2017.

2
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:13,483
Speaker 0: It's no longer spooky.

3
00:00:13,703 --> 00:00:14,205
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

4
00:00:14,365 --> 00:00:16,088
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:19,460
Speaker 0: tonight We're actually reviewing an anime.

6
00:00:19,781 --> 00:00:20,403
Speaker 0: That's new.

7
00:00:20,845 --> 00:00:22,330
Speaker 0: the ancient magus is bride.

8
00:00:23,178 --> 00:00:24,208
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

9
00:00:25,552 --> 00:00:30,510
Speaker 0: So you went to the Rangers game on Halloween, and it was weird that they won, but that's good.

10
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:35,890
Speaker 0: But because I didn't go to that Rangers game we did I was gonna throw a Halloween party.

11
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:45,050
Speaker 0: But the rim who thought he wanted to throw a Halloween party is like from six months ago And the rim right now is just real tired of dealing with like five conventions.

12
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,123
Speaker 0: I got a plan stuff for and I've been busy and like laundries piling up.

13
00:00:49,665 --> 00:00:58,282
Speaker 0: so instead of doing a Halloween party We had a few people over and we just watched Bette Midler in hocus-pocus Which I have not seen since I saw it in the theater as a kid.

14
00:00:58,864 --> 00:01:00,190
Speaker 1: I don't even know what that is.

15
00:01:01,313 --> 00:01:03,098
Speaker 1: I know who Bette Midler is, but I don't know what.

16
00:01:03,118 --> 00:01:13,770
Speaker 0: so you realize Bette Midler played a really over-the-top Witch in a Disney horror movie that sounds about right that get aired in the 90s that I saw in the theaters.

17
00:01:14,211 --> 00:01:20,450
Speaker 0: I did not and I remembered more of this movie than I my brain has any right to have remembered.

18
00:01:20,592 --> 00:01:21,950
Speaker 1: I mean, it's entirely possible.

19
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:28,158
Speaker 1: It's one of those things where if I see it some dark memory that's buried will just emerge But I never.

20
00:01:28,178 --> 00:01:37,170
Speaker 0: the only weird thing is that I remember There being way more songs than it because it was Bette Midler, but there's actually really only one and a half songs in it.

21
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:42,870
Speaker 0: There's Bette Midler's big song I'll put a spell on you and then there's this other song that the other weird witch things.

22
00:01:43,313 --> 00:01:45,530
Speaker 1: I think I know a song called off this.

23
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:47,757
Speaker 1: It sounds familiar.

24
00:01:47,777 --> 00:01:48,801
Speaker 0: It's not a new song.

25
00:01:49,383 --> 00:01:51,510
Speaker 0: Okay, but yeah, so we watched it again.

26
00:01:52,791 --> 00:02:03,366
Speaker 0: I'm probably just gonna do a Geek Bite review with Emily of it because we watched it again recently and I think my strategy for Halloween parties forever is going to be watch a weird old Halloween II thing.

27
00:02:03,386 --> 00:02:08,568
Speaker 1: I Also learned that it's usually a good strategy, but the you know, I got to watch some scary shit.

28
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,030
Speaker 1: There's not a lot of scary shit these days.

29
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,293
Speaker 0: well I feel like I could.

30
00:02:12,374 --> 00:02:22,882
Speaker 1: someday we'll just watch like one of the old classic slasher film and someone's gonna someone's gonna be like Oh, but Scott here's all these great horror movies that came out and I'm saying yeah There are plenty of horror movies that are and some even great ones.

31
00:02:22,922 --> 00:02:24,490
Speaker 1: I'm saying they're not fucking scary.

32
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,378
Speaker 1: Nothing is scary.

33
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,727
Speaker 0: I would argue get out was scary.

34
00:02:29,353 --> 00:02:34,052
Speaker 0: I found get out to be scary What?

35
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:35,097
Speaker 0: what does it have to be scary?

36
00:02:35,137 --> 00:02:35,398
Speaker 0: does that?

37
00:02:35,418 --> 00:02:38,010
Speaker 0: does the knife have to actually come out of the screen and try to?

38
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,553
Speaker 0: Hey,

39
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:41,951
Speaker 1: I have to feel terror as it about K imagine

40
00:02:42,192 --> 00:02:56,258
Speaker 0: the difference between scary because it makes you feel terror versus scary in the sense that it shows the Situation of other characters who are scared in a tense situation that causes you tension If not necessarily direct fear, right

41
00:02:56,278 --> 00:03:00,570
Speaker 1: like if I'm in real life and say there's lava coming down from a volcano.

42
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:04,847
Speaker 1: Now I'm afraid and I'm running right if I don't feel that way watching the movie.

43
00:03:05,028 --> 00:03:05,610
Speaker 1: It's not scary.

44
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,596
Speaker 0: That's real easy to fix.

45
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:12,750
Speaker 0: So next time we watch a slasher film like on Halloween I'll say content of the movie has to be making me afraid not some outside.

46
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:18,897
Speaker 0: no, cuz I was about to say all I have to do is stand behind you with a knife and I May or may not just cut you a little.

47
00:03:18,917 --> 00:03:24,380
Speaker 1: I'm saying The content of the movie has to be the thing causing the fear not you with the knife.

48
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,658
Speaker 0: I think that definition is dumb because that is not really feasible or possible?

49
00:03:31,423 --> 00:03:36,870
Speaker 1: There have been scary movies in the past like what Name one that's gonna meet your modern definition.

50
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,295
Speaker 1: I was scared of alien when I was a kid.

51
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:39,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, you scared of it now.

52
00:03:39,921 --> 00:03:42,278
Speaker 0: No, what would have to change to make you scared of it?

53
00:03:43,504 --> 00:03:44,192
Speaker 1: Make it scarier how?

54
00:03:45,543 --> 00:03:49,838
Speaker 0: What mechanic will they use other than the jump scare?

55
00:03:49,858 --> 00:03:55,560
Speaker 1: or Actually putting you in real physical jump scare doesn't count because that gives me a feeling of surprise and not terror.

56
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:57,848
Speaker 0: So what is a feeling of terror then?

57
00:03:57,868 --> 00:04:01,060
Speaker 1: the same feeling you have when you're standing at the bottom of volcano and lava is coming.

58
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,064
Speaker 0: That's not terror.

59
00:04:02,124 --> 00:04:04,916
Speaker 0: That is now that's resignation to death.

60
00:04:04,936 --> 00:04:05,518
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

61
00:04:05,558 --> 00:04:07,743
Speaker 0: I'm running While I'm running.

62
00:04:07,783 --> 00:04:11,413
Speaker 0: I still have a nihilistic resignation toward death as opposed to any particular terror.

63
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:11,494
Speaker 0: Mmm.

64
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:15,408
Speaker 0: Anyway, I Throw myself down mountains for fun.

65
00:04:15,428 --> 00:04:16,594
Speaker 0: I'm not really afraid of stuff.

66
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:27,580
Speaker 0: I Mean, I'm not afraid of Monsters, I think your definition of what constitutes scary in the context of media is misguided, but I digress hocus-pocus.

67
00:04:28,882 --> 00:04:36,244
Speaker 0: The things that are worth noting is that VFX when this movie was made in the early 90s Pretty fucking bad.

68
00:04:36,265 --> 00:04:43,104
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah there but they are a step above the VFX From the 80s.

69
00:04:43,365 --> 00:04:48,459
Speaker 1: Well, here's the something I noticed a lot is that when a Tron come out the first Tron 80 what?

70
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:52,346
Speaker 1: 2 4 2 4 something.

71
00:04:52,647 --> 00:04:54,913
Speaker 0: It was 81, but I don't remember right.

72
00:04:55,214 --> 00:04:59,325
Speaker 1: and you look at the old Tron and it's obviously - I was right.

73
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:00,450
Speaker 1: It's as old as us right.

74
00:05:00,831 --> 00:05:04,425
Speaker 1: and you look at the old Tron and I'm not gonna say it's good Obviously, it's not good.

75
00:05:04,726 --> 00:05:10,680
Speaker 1: You can see that it was made with really old 1982 computers Right with set with sad graphics.

76
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:13,798
Speaker 1: I kind of graphics that your home computer made in the early 90s.

77
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,636
Speaker 0: But it's dated in a way to where it looks like something from its time as opposed to.

78
00:05:18,716 --> 00:05:19,720
Speaker 0: well weird.

79
00:05:19,882 --> 00:05:22,162
Speaker 1: And even though it is not good Right.

80
00:05:22,643 --> 00:05:31,231
Speaker 1: when you look at computer graphics from movies in the 90s pre Toy Story pre Toy Story Right, they're just awful.

81
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:43,400
Speaker 1: Even if you watched them when they were brand new Wasn't until later Toy Story and then also even the matrix which you know All right, stuff like that where the seat the computer graphics in the movie got to a point.

82
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:50,177
Speaker 0: I'm talking more about the VFX like just basic compositing and simple effects like those kinds of things.

83
00:05:50,197 --> 00:05:52,322
Speaker 0: They're just in a movie 80s.

84
00:05:52,703 --> 00:05:59,473
Speaker 0: all use like these same few techniques and if you watch I don't know Howard the Duck or the He-Man live-action movie.

85
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:03,828
Speaker 0: they both use like this same Because their budget was low right.

86
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:05,794
Speaker 1: Oh Star Wars didn't have those problems in his front.

87
00:06:05,814 --> 00:06:08,080
Speaker 0: the 70 Star Wars used primarily practical effects.

88
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,659
Speaker 1: However, they'd still lightsaber still look good.

89
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,580
Speaker 0: So yes, they did look good, but a lot of practical effects or hand-done effects, but I digress.

90
00:06:17,341 --> 00:06:19,119
Speaker 1: The x-wing still went pee-pee-pew.

91
00:06:19,621 --> 00:06:25,579
Speaker 0: The other crazy thing is we're watching the movie and all we could think was everyone involved in this is still alive and still working.

92
00:06:26,202 --> 00:06:29,880
Speaker 0: Hocus-pocus to with Bette Midler today would be fucking amazing.

93
00:06:30,602 --> 00:06:32,007
Speaker 0: So a lot of the trip.

94
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:32,749
Speaker 0: guess what?

95
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:38,609
Speaker 0: not only is that actually happening and Disney is doing it Mm-hmm, but Bette Midler was like guys.

96
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:39,894
Speaker 0: stop trying to make this happen.

97
00:06:40,335 --> 00:06:42,022
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna be involved in this It's shit.

98
00:06:42,484 --> 00:06:46,660
Speaker 1: So here's the same story, but the opposite because it's all Halloween II lately, right?

99
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,970
Speaker 1: The there's been talk again of God.

100
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,640
Speaker 0: the article I clicked on randomly is about the remake, right?

101
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,930
Speaker 1: Okay, there has been talk of Beetlejuice because it's Halloween.

102
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,215
Speaker 1: people talking about Beetlejuice.

103
00:06:57,415 --> 00:06:58,800
Speaker 1: I got Beetlejuice is cool.

104
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,603
Speaker 0: Yeah, we have to do it.

105
00:06:59,623 --> 00:07:00,668
Speaker 0: There's a show on you Beetlejuice.

106
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:03,680
Speaker 0: I have a lot of very specific opinions about Beetlejuice.

107
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:09,620
Speaker 1: Anyway, the thing is there was a Beetlejuice sequel and this huge story behind it and it could still happen.

108
00:07:10,141 --> 00:07:16,180
Speaker 1: No, like Michael Keaton and Winona Ryder have been like sort of signed on to it since it began way way way back.

109
00:07:16,321 --> 00:07:25,799
Speaker 1: it's called like Beetlejuice in Hawaii or something and It's like still has life somehow even after all those years and it's not a Bette Midler being like.

110
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:26,302
Speaker 1: no It's like.

111
00:07:26,322 --> 00:07:28,192
Speaker 1: they're like, yes, but it just has.

112
00:07:28,654 --> 00:07:29,640
Speaker 1: it just hasn't come about.

113
00:07:30,103 --> 00:07:32,820
Speaker 0: So with Beetlejuice that we'll get into anime in a second.

114
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:38,507
Speaker 0: But I noticed something in the course of talking more about Halloween shit after Halloween It's the day after Halloween where you want.

115
00:07:38,527 --> 00:07:40,578
Speaker 0: It's also the 12th anniversary of gig nights.

116
00:07:40,638 --> 00:07:46,226
Speaker 0: last night You're doing this for 12 goddamn years too many years 1,180 episodes.

117
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:47,109
Speaker 1: I quit and go home.

118
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:47,831
Speaker 1: I'm done.

119
00:07:47,992 --> 00:07:48,393
Speaker 0: Finally.

120
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:49,397
Speaker 0: My time is here myself.

121
00:07:49,437 --> 00:07:50,360
Speaker 0: I'll just get the other Scott.

122
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,385
Speaker 0: I got like three Scott's.

123
00:07:51,546 --> 00:07:51,727
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

124
00:07:51,948 --> 00:07:52,892
Speaker 0: I'll just bring one of them in.

125
00:07:52,912 --> 00:07:53,174
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

126
00:07:53,555 --> 00:08:00,186
Speaker 0: I I Forced Scott prime to do at least one or two Podcasts in the past and I can.

127
00:08:00,568 --> 00:08:01,291
Speaker 0: I can train him.

128
00:08:01,311 --> 00:08:01,794
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

129
00:08:02,055 --> 00:08:14,700
Speaker 0: It'll take a while though, but Beetlejuice the in Beetlejuice the movie contrary to every spin-off and Related merchandise everything that wasn't the actual movie that it was ever made.

130
00:08:15,324 --> 00:08:19,369
Speaker 0: They all treat it like Beetlejuice is the hero But in the movie Beetlejuice is the goddamn villain.

131
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:21,357
Speaker 1: Beetlejuice is only also only in like 20% of the movie.

132
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:23,915
Speaker 0: Yeah, but he is the villain really.

133
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:29,843
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm He like he's just this villain and he's there and the moral of the movie is don't fucking talk to that guy He's the worst.

134
00:08:30,064 --> 00:08:33,475
Speaker 0: He'll he will ruin everything and he's dumb also kind of annoying.

135
00:08:33,716 --> 00:08:33,977
Speaker 1: Yes.

136
00:08:33,996 --> 00:08:34,799
Speaker 1: He's just a bad dude.

137
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,591
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they went to go.

138
00:08:36,611 --> 00:08:38,159
Speaker 1: He's basically it's a Faustian tale.

139
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,938
Speaker 1: They went to make a deal with the devil and then he was like.

140
00:08:42,363 --> 00:08:45,704
Speaker 1: And then they beat him and they put him back and they did the deal They went to.

141
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,420
Speaker 0: really they went to do with the devil's bureaucracy and that was too hard.

142
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:56,438
Speaker 0: So then they went and talked to this like low-tier like shit devil and he made the shit that they expect like What did you expect?

143
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:06,386
Speaker 0: But uh, like if there was a cartoon and that cartoon was just like Beetlejuice and Daria going on adventures together Like all that weird star.

144
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:12,020
Speaker 1: now, I know that that you know, Lydia is Lydia is very goth and similar in character to Daria.

145
00:09:14,544 --> 00:09:17,240
Speaker 0: My brain was like nope, no, you're wrong.

146
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:25,108
Speaker 0: So anyway, you know the biggest anime news that we probably haven't talked about is this funimation thing Which I haven't paid a lot of attention to.

147
00:09:25,288 --> 00:09:26,734
Speaker 1: so it's one of those situations.

148
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,821
Speaker 1: That's a news but it's not a news yet Right.

149
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:40,372
Speaker 1: So funimation is the number one anime distributor in the United States as far as I'm aware possibly North America I don't know if they do Canada or whatever, but and from a Anime fan like anime consumer perspective.

150
00:09:40,393 --> 00:09:41,497
Speaker 0: They're doing a pretty great job.

151
00:09:41,578 --> 00:09:42,160
Speaker 1: They're doing alright.

152
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:49,520
Speaker 1: They're doing better than the previous ones that all failed like genie on and you know And a lot of those old companies were sort of I guess absorbed into fun.

153
00:09:49,641 --> 00:09:59,520
Speaker 1: I don't know what happened really back then But basically of all the ashes of all those companies that were trying to bring anime to the u.s It's pretty much now just like funimation is the king, right?

154
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,016
Speaker 1: They get the licenses they want and they bring out those shows in the u.s.

155
00:10:03,056 --> 00:10:03,860
Speaker 1: And they're on crunchyroll.

156
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,688
Speaker 0: The prince at this point is Netflix.

157
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,453
Speaker 0: We're just like we're just gonna make our own anime.

158
00:10:08,614 --> 00:10:09,958
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're making like 30.

159
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:10,700
Speaker 1: Amazon, Japan.

160
00:10:10,881 --> 00:10:15,379
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know you got these other players in there the crunchyrolls the Amazons whatever but it's mostly funimation.

161
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:19,552
Speaker 1: So Funimation Now it's a private company.

162
00:10:19,572 --> 00:10:20,195
Speaker 1: It's not public.

163
00:10:20,215 --> 00:10:20,978
Speaker 1: You can't buy shares in.

164
00:10:21,018 --> 00:10:22,784
Speaker 1: it Has been.

165
00:10:22,844 --> 00:10:31,416
Speaker 1: a majority of it is now owned by Sony play PlayStation Sony that is a7s camera Sony TV Bravia Sony.

166
00:10:31,617 --> 00:10:47,060
Speaker 0: anything Involving Sony is fraught with ridiculous contradictions for the simple fact that different parts of Sony actually want very different things and Sabotage each other and they often operate Independently, but also not independently Sony.

167
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,641
Speaker 1: The only thing a lot of them have in common is the name Sony and that they're all under the umbrella of big Sony in Japan.

168
00:10:52,722 --> 00:11:03,860
Speaker 0: but like Sony's prosumer video stuff is pretty great But it's hobbled often by Sony's entertainment side that wants ridiculous DRM and nonsense and that kind of.

169
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,195
Speaker 1: yeah Even the PSP was hobbled by like the computer department forcing it to use memory sticks.

170
00:11:08,296 --> 00:11:09,460
Speaker 1: It's like, you know stuff like that.

171
00:11:09,581 --> 00:11:13,920
Speaker 1: Anyway, so as of now Sony owns a majority of Funimation.

172
00:11:14,945 --> 00:11:18,031
Speaker 1: the CEO of Funimation Previously, what's his name?

173
00:11:18,092 --> 00:11:19,379
Speaker 1: guy Fukunaga or something?

174
00:11:20,901 --> 00:11:24,479
Speaker 1: His name you see a lot if you pay attention to anime news in the u.s.

175
00:11:25,243 --> 00:11:25,544
Speaker 1: I've never.

176
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:28,596
Speaker 1: I don't know what the person is like though, you know old geek knives.

177
00:11:28,636 --> 00:11:29,660
Speaker 0: We would have known they.

178
00:11:30,342 --> 00:11:34,638
Speaker 1: Yes, they still own some amount of Funimation, but obviously not enough to.

179
00:11:34,658 --> 00:11:36,083
Speaker 0: so according to this They probably might.

180
00:11:36,103 --> 00:11:37,830
Speaker 0: they own at most 5% now.

181
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,416
Speaker 1: Yeah, something a CEO owns right.

182
00:11:39,436 --> 00:11:43,347
Speaker 0: a CEO owns shares Was only valued at 150 million.

183
00:11:43,547 --> 00:11:46,074
Speaker 1: yeah, but it's not that big that's they're just cuz.

184
00:11:46,094 --> 00:11:46,455
Speaker 1: think about it.

185
00:11:46,656 --> 00:11:48,120
Speaker 1: their profits are not huge.

186
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,268
Speaker 1: They're paying to license animes.

187
00:11:50,288 --> 00:11:51,211
Speaker 1: They're not getting that right.

188
00:11:51,231 --> 00:11:59,684
Speaker 1: They're paying a lot of money in license fees and then Streaming it and selling merchants shit like that to try to make back the license fees Profit.

189
00:12:00,005 --> 00:12:04,700
Speaker 1: and then they send most of the money the revenue right back to the license plate, you know to Japan.

190
00:12:05,103 --> 00:12:06,553
Speaker 1: How much money does Funimation keep?

191
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:07,600
Speaker 1: how many people even work there?

192
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,627
Speaker 1: It's probably like a small little company in California.

193
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:10,570
Speaker 1: So the listener says again.

194
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,714
Speaker 0: Yeah Fukunaga.

195
00:12:11,915 --> 00:12:12,176
Speaker 1: Yeah.

196
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:20,314
Speaker 1: Anyway, so Right as of now the CEO still the CEO that all their licenses are the same.

197
00:12:20,334 --> 00:12:22,400
Speaker 1: all their releases are untouched.

198
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:35,827
Speaker 1: right everything they're doing for the near future is unchanged, but If I know what I know anytime ever in the history of ever that a company has been bought by another company Shit changes eventually, right?

199
00:12:35,848 --> 00:12:40,140
Speaker 1: They always say oh business is usual and then ain't gonna be business as usual.

200
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:57,020
Speaker 1: So the changes that Sony brings to Funimation are going to have a huge impact on anime Legally released in the United States, but you won't see that impact for a year or plus ish Around a year at least minimum or maybe a little less me a little more.

201
00:12:57,301 --> 00:13:08,697
Speaker 0: It's interesting though that this is also happening at a time when the distribution side like how people actually watch anime Is having a pretty increasingly large splintering to where there isn't just one place.

202
00:13:08,717 --> 00:13:14,500
Speaker 0: You can watch all your anime Mm-hmm, and on one hand I was very happy when it was crunchyroll or bust because that was just easy.

203
00:13:15,006 --> 00:13:15,839
Speaker 0: I could see a lot of anime.

204
00:13:16,941 --> 00:13:19,571
Speaker 0: I'm basically not willing to pay for multiple services.

205
00:13:20,052 --> 00:13:20,253
Speaker 1: Nope.

206
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:21,598
Speaker 1: I pay for one at a time.

207
00:13:21,618 --> 00:13:23,860
Speaker 0: That's my rule Yep, so I will weigh in the same area.

208
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,318
Speaker 0: So I pay for Netflix and crunchyroll because I watch a lot of Netflix right now.

209
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:37,007
Speaker 1: right now I'm paying for Hulu and crunchyroll, but as soon as The next your petal season is done and there's a new anime to watch I'll temporarily turn my crunchyroll off.

210
00:13:37,027 --> 00:13:39,517
Speaker 0: ever though cuz we're gonna we're gonna review a lot more anime.

211
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:46,500
Speaker 0: on geek nights I keep picking crunchyroll shows, but if you switch to Netflix I'll just pick a show that I know is on that right and then one South Park is over.

212
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,293
Speaker 1: I'm gonna switch from Hulu to Netflix and watch some witches and some other stuff.

213
00:13:50,554 --> 00:13:54,643
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, you haven't seen witches Scott.

214
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:55,426
Speaker 0: it saved anime.

215
00:13:55,487 --> 00:13:56,089
Speaker 0: It's so good.

216
00:13:56,109 --> 00:14:00,067
Speaker 1: I mean we trigger saved anime a long time ago Yeah, but it can't save it anime again.

217
00:14:00,087 --> 00:14:01,553
Speaker 0: anyway, it's crashed.

218
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:04,687
Speaker 0: that that itch I had from Maho skydive.

219
00:14:04,727 --> 00:14:05,611
Speaker 0: so back in the day.

220
00:14:05,872 --> 00:14:07,840
Speaker 0: My brain was just like what's this drug?

221
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,568
Speaker 0: It's back and then it ended.

222
00:14:09,588 --> 00:14:14,392
Speaker 1: it knows like I've seen the little witch academia movies Did we actually do the episode on that second movie?

223
00:14:14,473 --> 00:14:15,277
Speaker 0: No, we didn't know.

224
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:15,819
Speaker 1: I've seen it.

225
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,168
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I could watch that again.

226
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,355
Speaker 1: We could do episode at any time.

227
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:23,560
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, so yeah, just like when Disney bought Marvel, right?

228
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,174
Speaker 1: Yeah, you didn't see changes for a while, but now you fucking do right.

229
00:14:27,335 --> 00:14:30,480
Speaker 0: so same deal Yep, so we don't know if it'll be good or bad.

230
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:36,617
Speaker 0: I worry the changes will be negative partly because I don't necessarily trust I don't.

231
00:14:36,657 --> 00:14:37,800
Speaker 1: I can't see them being positive.

232
00:14:38,102 --> 00:14:39,811
Speaker 0: Yeah, that Sony will.

233
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:41,440
Speaker 1: they're gonna be neutral at best.

234
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:47,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I see them doing shady stuff around exclusive streaming deals and weird nonsense as well.

235
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,491
Speaker 1: You watch anime so it makes yourself a PlayStation 4.

236
00:14:49,491 --> 00:14:56,220
Speaker 0: Yeah PlayStation exclusive for the first month on the simulcast who knows doesn't matter.

237
00:14:56,261 --> 00:15:05,975
Speaker 0: I'm not even a lie If I try to pay for anime and I do pay like I pay for country roll and stuff and I even paid for the Funimation thing for a while back to watch like Yurikuma and stuff back in the day.

238
00:15:05,995 --> 00:15:07,360
Speaker 0: Mmm got back in the day.

239
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,203
Speaker 0: That wasn't that long ago.

240
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:19,418
Speaker 0: No, but in all media the moment I encounter resistance where Figuring out how to click on buttons and pay money to watch something is even remotely challenging.

241
00:15:19,498 --> 00:15:23,247
Speaker 0: Yeah I pirate so fast.

242
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:24,052
Speaker 0: I can't even blink.

243
00:15:24,193 --> 00:15:25,460
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that's how I do.

244
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,486
Speaker 0: So it's kind of an aside.

245
00:15:28,526 --> 00:15:38,421
Speaker 0: but in the other news, that's not really new news about anime But it's a topic That I feel like we could do a deeper show on in the future because it's starting to actually affect a lot of anime fans Now.

246
00:15:38,963 --> 00:15:43,380
Speaker 0: so when our friends brought hocus-pocus over to watch it, they brought it on a DVD.

247
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,552
Speaker 1: Yeah I had the same problem recently.

248
00:15:45,613 --> 00:15:51,979
Speaker 1: is I needed to show Porco Rosso to Amanda who hadn't seen it when one of the jubilee movies she had not seen better to be a pig than a?

249
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,083
Speaker 0: That's right.

250
00:15:53,204 --> 00:15:57,560
Speaker 1: and I was like, whoa, I actually happen to have the DVD of that and a bonus DVD that came with it.

251
00:15:57,781 --> 00:16:00,131
Speaker 0: Hey remember I got like eight DVDs.

252
00:16:00,171 --> 00:16:00,894
Speaker 0: a beautiful dreamer.

253
00:16:00,915 --> 00:16:01,377
Speaker 1: So I went.

254
00:16:01,397 --> 00:16:13,111
Speaker 1: I found the DVD I had in my binder of DVDs and I went over to the Htbc the new one that has no optical drive to speak of and I said, oh Yeah, my desktop still had an optical drive.

255
00:16:13,332 --> 00:16:14,296
Speaker 1: So I used handbrake.

256
00:16:14,336 --> 00:16:14,798
Speaker 1: I ripped it.

257
00:16:14,858 --> 00:16:15,420
Speaker 1: I transferred it.

258
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,613
Speaker 1: We watched a nice mp4.

259
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:17,179
Speaker 1: It was all good.

260
00:16:17,621 --> 00:16:26,247
Speaker 1: But I thought hmm maybe what I should do since I ain't planning to buy a computer maybe next year sometime when Nvidia 1180s come out, right?

261
00:16:26,327 --> 00:16:28,758
Speaker 1: I don't not saying I'll buy an 1180, but I'll buy an 11 something.

262
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:38,900
Speaker 1: Yeah presumably maybe I should buy myself a USB 3 optical drive now and Just have it and then never had to buy another optical drive again.

263
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,738
Speaker 1: As long as I live that is what I did because actually mine doesn't play booray.

264
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,459
Speaker 0: No, why would I ever have booray?

265
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,721
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is I never planned to ever buy a booray in my life and I've managed to not do that up to this Point.

266
00:16:50,741 --> 00:16:52,406
Speaker 1: so I see no reason that that would ever change.

267
00:16:52,426 --> 00:16:57,320
Speaker 1: Yep, but there are occasions where you just come across a free booray.

268
00:16:57,681 --> 00:16:59,868
Speaker 1: it's just lying around or someone else has one.

269
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:05,356
Speaker 1: and Or external booray drive that I say I know it's blue ray.

270
00:17:05,396 --> 00:17:06,219
Speaker 1: I'm saying booray cuz.

271
00:17:07,482 --> 00:17:11,262
Speaker 1: Same reason I say Titan even though I know it's pronounced Titan My.

272
00:17:11,303 --> 00:17:17,500
Speaker 1: they're not really any significantly more expensive or different than any other optical drive that doesn't do booray.

273
00:17:18,066 --> 00:17:23,260
Speaker 1: So I was like, oh well Why not get the booray one for that one day that someone's gonna bring a booray to your house.

274
00:17:23,681 --> 00:17:24,223
Speaker 1: You can watch it.

275
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:28,500
Speaker 0: thing is I could probably just pirate whatever it is that they ostensibly have on that booray faster.

276
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:34,819
Speaker 1: Then I could get the booray Like, you know some data backed up on a booray because they have a booray writer or something or yeah.

277
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:36,525
Speaker 0: Also put it on the cloud.

278
00:17:36,565 --> 00:17:41,822
Speaker 1: sorry kid it's to pay the ten bucks extra or whoever small amount it is to get the Slightly better.

279
00:17:41,903 --> 00:17:43,227
Speaker 0: Oh, you want to I'm gladly.

280
00:17:43,247 --> 00:17:47,480
Speaker 0: I will gladly sell you my old zip drive because someone might bring a zip disk over.

281
00:17:47,881 --> 00:17:48,303
Speaker 1: What if?

282
00:17:48,905 --> 00:17:49,226
Speaker 1: what?

283
00:17:49,346 --> 00:17:56,071
Speaker 1: if it's like apocalypse times and the important data is on the zip disk and then I go in I pull out My zip drive and I'm like the world is saved bitches.

284
00:17:56,171 --> 00:17:58,220
Speaker 0: All of his zip drives fail and zips fail.

285
00:17:58,321 --> 00:18:00,432
Speaker 1: Why do you think I got my apple 2gs in the closet?

286
00:18:00,452 --> 00:18:01,900
Speaker 1: gonna save the world with that motherfucking?

287
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:09,060
Speaker 0: But there's no Intel management in there in the old days, the only way to see anime was to pirate it.

288
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,653
Speaker 0: Well, the oldest days I'm skipping the old days.

289
00:18:11,693 --> 00:18:13,421
Speaker 0: as far as most of you are concerned Please is.

290
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:17,875
Speaker 0: you either bought the DVD you saw in the theater in Japan or you pirated it.

291
00:18:18,317 --> 00:18:19,300
Speaker 1: Japanese TV in this.

292
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:53,414
Speaker 0: but nowadays Pretty much we all just stream our anime Which is fine because I prefer streaming for almost all use cases and I generally don't buy physical media And I never have the exception to that is I would buy physical media before digital media really existed For things that I did not only watch but I had already seen in their entirety Mm-hmm that I thought were important for some reason and that I expected to not only rewatch Semi off like periodically for the rest of my life.

293
00:18:53,514 --> 00:18:54,700
Speaker 1: give to other people to watch.

294
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:59,416
Speaker 0: Yes to show to other people like I will to this day be like, oh you haven't seen cowboy bebop.

295
00:18:59,818 --> 00:19:03,559
Speaker 0: take this Come back to me, you know after this weekend and tell me what you think.

296
00:19:03,861 --> 00:19:08,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, and now that physical media is stupid and I don't want all that space being wasted in my apartment.

297
00:19:09,661 --> 00:19:16,917
Speaker 0: I don't really have any way to own anime because I'm certainly not buying physical media the way it's structured today And no one's gonna sell you a DRM free mp4.

298
00:19:18,002 --> 00:19:24,723
Speaker 0: and the other important thing is even if I wanted to buy physical media not gonna buy physical media until I Watch a show.

299
00:19:24,744 --> 00:19:28,280
Speaker 0: and I'm confident that that show is going to be a classic for all time.

300
00:19:28,441 --> 00:19:31,194
Speaker 0: And I'm also not worried about the time I make that determination.

301
00:19:31,274 --> 00:19:32,440
Speaker 0: It's usually out of print again.

302
00:19:32,621 --> 00:19:39,913
Speaker 1: I'm also not worried about preservation because a everything that I thought would be like Oh, you'll never be able to get this is come back eventually.

303
00:19:39,953 --> 00:19:44,655
Speaker 0: I went on YouTube and watch the Halloween special last night in college.

304
00:19:44,715 --> 00:19:45,820
Speaker 1: I want to watch it in college.

305
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:55,711
Speaker 1: I pre-ordered this macross box set from anime go right for like almost $300 of college money Which is a lot Sitting your poor college student.

306
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:56,556
Speaker 1: I still have it.

307
00:19:56,597 --> 00:19:57,160
Speaker 1: It's still great.

308
00:19:57,221 --> 00:19:58,235
Speaker 1: I'm still glad I bought it.

309
00:19:59,422 --> 00:20:06,118
Speaker 1: But now you can just watch the real macross not robo attack like on Amazon Prime streaming with subtitles.

310
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:13,140
Speaker 0: Nope, so You know now I don't want physical media and I'm not even afraid of DRM.

311
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,351
Speaker 0: The problem is streaming services stuff falls out of rotation.

312
00:20:16,392 --> 00:20:16,934
Speaker 0: Then it's gone.

313
00:20:17,315 --> 00:20:18,640
Speaker 0: Can't watch it unless you pirate it.

314
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,731
Speaker 1: Well, you know it comes back eventually.

315
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:22,260
Speaker 0: and also I'm sorry things don't you know.

316
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:27,340
Speaker 1: The other reason you don't worry about preserving is because eat there's some other nerd out there who's preserving it, right?

317
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,194
Speaker 1: Yep, it will always be accessible if you can find that one nerd.

318
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,400
Speaker 1: that nerd doesn't have to be me.

319
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,761
Speaker 1: I got better things to do with my short life on this earth now.

320
00:20:33,781 --> 00:20:46,750
Speaker 0: the other reason I you I would have bought physical media was sometimes I want to do a review thing like with antenna and I want to like use that media to make other media which is a pain in the ass To do through a streaming service.

321
00:20:47,011 --> 00:20:48,499
Speaker 0: So I just have to pirate that nowadays.

322
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,785
Speaker 0: But I want.

323
00:20:50,805 --> 00:20:52,994
Speaker 0: there is still the use case where there is a show.

324
00:20:53,395 --> 00:21:02,079
Speaker 0: that I decide is something I'm going to show to other people for a long time to come and I want to have per a file permanent access to it of some kind.

325
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:06,435
Speaker 0: What I really want is actually just a DRM free file that I can pay money for.

326
00:21:06,575 --> 00:21:10,286
Speaker 0: I'll even pay good money for it And just download it and that doesn't exist.

327
00:21:10,306 --> 00:21:10,948
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

328
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:14,257
Speaker 0: I've been doing that with Amazon for certain shows.

329
00:21:14,317 --> 00:21:18,060
Speaker 0: I've been buying Steven Universe and Adventure Time instead of streaming.

330
00:21:18,181 --> 00:21:22,060
Speaker 1: I thought about see the thing is you when you told me you did that I was like first I didn't realize they had that.

331
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,320
Speaker 1: They have like the newest episodes of Adventure Time on there.

332
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,263
Speaker 0: Yeah, like.

333
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,335
Speaker 1: they're up to speed with what like is somebody watching on Cartoon Network?

334
00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:32,080
Speaker 0: so episodes on TV It's on Amazon within like a day, right?

335
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,626
Speaker 1: So that is really tempting.

336
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:36,417
Speaker 1: but how much does the season of Adventure Time cost on there?

337
00:21:36,477 --> 00:21:37,220
Speaker 0: ten to twenty bucks?

338
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,227
Speaker 1: Okay, so how many seasons are there?

339
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:40,934
Speaker 0: the number of actual seasons?

340
00:21:40,974 --> 00:21:42,300
Speaker 0: times two because they split them usually.

341
00:21:43,501 --> 00:21:47,520
Speaker 0: So it costs about as much as an old anime box set to buy a many seasons long.

342
00:21:47,661 --> 00:21:55,675
Speaker 1: It cost about the same as a right but it's like compared to the price It would cost to like just subscribe to the thing and keep watching them, but they don't offer it.

343
00:21:55,756 --> 00:21:57,220
Speaker 1: on the prime subscription thing.

344
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:01,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just like I. you know, it's just so much money that it's like it's not worth it.

345
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,460
Speaker 1: But I do want to have access to those episodes.

346
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,267
Speaker 0: Yep, but we're through at the convenience.

347
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:08,279
Speaker 0: but anime for example can't rely on that kind of thing.

348
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,519
Speaker 1: Can you just give me those episodes so I don't have to buy them?

349
00:22:11,002 --> 00:22:15,040
Speaker 0: Uh, I'd have to pirate them from my service cuz I can only watch them on the Amazon thing.

350
00:22:16,071 --> 00:22:17,414
Speaker 0: But it does just work like it's great.

351
00:22:17,434 --> 00:22:18,316
Speaker 1: I'm sure it does this work.

352
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:18,536
Speaker 1: Yeah.

353
00:22:18,617 --> 00:22:20,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I do trust it won't go away.

354
00:22:20,301 --> 00:22:21,679
Speaker 0: I trust it as much as I trust steam.

355
00:22:22,561 --> 00:22:24,026
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was a recent poll of like.

356
00:22:24,067 --> 00:22:26,255
Speaker 1: which of the big tech companies do you trust the most?

357
00:22:26,335 --> 00:22:28,143
Speaker 1: and Amazon was like number one In all categories.

358
00:22:28,184 --> 00:22:28,485
Speaker 0: Yeah.

359
00:22:28,746 --> 00:22:28,948
Speaker 0: Yeah.

360
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:31,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway, I don't want to go down.

361
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,340
Speaker 1: Amazon's not evil.

362
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:41,992
Speaker 1: They're just evil in such a way that it punishes other businesses that aren't Amazon and is great for customers Which is why people love Amazon, even though they're just as evil as everyone else.

363
00:22:42,052 --> 00:22:44,200
Speaker 1: The difference is Facebook punishes users.

364
00:22:44,481 --> 00:22:46,347
Speaker 1: No, right Twitter punishes users.

365
00:22:46,387 --> 00:22:47,310
Speaker 1: Google punishes users.

366
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:50,380
Speaker 1: I guess Amazon only punishes other businesses by putting them out of business.

367
00:22:50,741 --> 00:22:57,240
Speaker 0: I still think physical media is stupid because physical media is just digital media locked on to a format for no good reason.

368
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,384
Speaker 0: I'd rather just get a file.

369
00:22:58,846 --> 00:23:04,067
Speaker 1: even if I had the bure drive and I was willing to buy buries I would just rip them all and throw them out.

370
00:23:04,329 --> 00:23:06,860
Speaker 1: Yep, or tell them or bring them to book off or who knows what?

371
00:23:08,341 --> 00:23:11,172
Speaker 1: So just like we did back in high school with PlayStation games.

372
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:13,040
Speaker 1: Yeah copy them to another CDR.

373
00:23:14,301 --> 00:23:14,763
Speaker 1: Bring them back.

374
00:23:14,783 --> 00:23:18,679
Speaker 1: You turn mod shit on a blockbuster rent the game copy it bring it back.

375
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:27,204
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah There's the these fracturing of all these different streaming services coupled with all the different ways to get media It the the problem

376
00:23:27,244 --> 00:23:27,766
Speaker 1: is growing

377
00:23:27,826 --> 00:23:44,035
Speaker 0: again rather than shrinking which I think is gonna drive a lot of people like me back to the high seas, sir, and that's all I got to say about that because it's time for things Of the day.

378
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:49,090
Speaker 0: So if you don't follow it, which actually not that many people subscribe to this channel.

379
00:23:49,555 --> 00:23:56,508
Speaker 0: And again, I gotta be very clear I am NOT saying that you should watch the original he-man again in any capacity.

380
00:23:56,588 --> 00:23:58,810
Speaker 0: No, I Made that mistake.

381
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:10,213
Speaker 1: I learned a thing I watched when I was extremely young and had almost no memories of it other than like vague images of and Toys more than the show because the show You know didn't air for that battle damage Skeletor.

382
00:24:10,253 --> 00:24:17,404
Speaker 1: like there's a point in my life where I must have been like five or six and wanted to watch he-man because I had He-man toys and it just was not on TV anymore and I couldn't see it.

383
00:24:17,444 --> 00:24:18,268
Speaker 1: and it's not like you could.

384
00:24:18,569 --> 00:24:20,710
Speaker 1: well It was later by VHS tapes of he-man.

385
00:24:21,653 --> 00:24:27,270
Speaker 1: You know this like it wasn't the thing you couldn't do that, but way more it wasn't until I'm here in college.

386
00:24:27,351 --> 00:24:30,554
Speaker 1: They put out like transformers on DVD and I was like, whoa I can actually see that.

387
00:24:30,614 --> 00:24:39,670
Speaker 0: now way more interesting than actually watching episodes of he-man is Learning about all the meta around the production of he-man itself and the character.

388
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,137
Speaker 1: Didn't I do a thing in the day about that?

389
00:24:41,197 --> 00:24:42,704
Speaker 1: No, I did thunder the barbarian.

390
00:24:42,724 --> 00:24:54,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the Official like for real official he-man YouTube account which has less than a hundred thousand subscribers And these videos have fewer views than a lot of our penny like packs lectures.

391
00:24:55,173 --> 00:24:56,418
Speaker 0: So you should probably subscribe to this.

392
00:24:57,141 --> 00:24:59,150
Speaker 0: the content there is pretty good and fascinating.

393
00:24:59,771 --> 00:25:03,130
Speaker 0: So what I'm linking to here is a pretty long video.

394
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:07,170
Speaker 0: It's like 10 minutes long and it's just 50.

395
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,260
Speaker 0: Interesting things about evil Lynn.

396
00:25:09,601 --> 00:25:12,493
Speaker 0: and if you don't remember who evil Lynn was no I remember this.

397
00:25:12,513 --> 00:25:14,219
Speaker 1: the thing is the only positive.

398
00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:17,850
Speaker 1: the most positive thing about he-man at least for me is the character design.

399
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:21,330
Speaker 1: You're all these crazy characters because they're trying to make all these toys that I bought.

400
00:25:22,171 --> 00:25:28,438
Speaker 1: If I see a character I go that's a he-man character and unless it's he-man or skeleton or she-ra or something or orko I don't know their name.

401
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:29,809
Speaker 1: I'm like who the hell is that?

402
00:25:30,453 --> 00:25:33,490
Speaker 1: You could have showed me that character and I say that's the evil lady from he-man.

403
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:33,911
Speaker 1: I don't know.

404
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:35,456
Speaker 1: I didn't know she was evil in till just now.

405
00:25:36,139 --> 00:25:38,607
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I also couldn't tell you the plot of any episode.

406
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:51,042
Speaker 0: I Vaguely remember the plot of some of these episodes but anyway, this video is just kind of fascinating and If you watch t-man as a child and don't remember much about it, don't go.

407
00:25:51,243 --> 00:25:55,085
Speaker 1: don't go ruin your positive memories by Going to see this show.

408
00:25:55,145 --> 00:25:55,570
Speaker 1: that's awful.

409
00:25:55,931 --> 00:26:02,150
Speaker 0: But this video will probably trigger a lot of weird flashbacks and you'll realize you remember more than you thought.

410
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:03,657
Speaker 1: Nope, I definitely don't.

411
00:26:04,421 --> 00:26:06,190
Speaker 0: you don't remember the space battleship.

412
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:11,021
Speaker 0: No, don't remember evil in teaming up with the sorceress woman and Skeletor.

413
00:26:11,162 --> 00:26:11,362
Speaker 1: No.

414
00:26:11,663 --> 00:26:12,886
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't.

415
00:26:13,367 --> 00:26:13,888
Speaker 0: so what do you got?

416
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:17,820
Speaker 1: So You know these days in the in the hockey times.

417
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,070
Speaker 1: There's not as many fights as there used to be which is a good thing.

418
00:26:20,311 --> 00:26:23,666
Speaker 1: Yeah, because fighting is barbaric and bad and we don't want to see that.

419
00:26:23,686 --> 00:26:24,670
Speaker 1: we want to see hockey hockey.

420
00:26:24,971 --> 00:26:26,176
Speaker 1: I went to hockey game last night.

421
00:26:26,457 --> 00:26:27,200
Speaker 1: There were no fights.

422
00:26:27,321 --> 00:26:28,505
Speaker 1: It was still exciting as hell.

423
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:29,610
Speaker 1: We don't need fights in hockey.

424
00:26:29,691 --> 00:26:31,950
Speaker 1: I'm glad that there are less of them and there should be none of them.

425
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:36,870
Speaker 0: No, it's it's perverse, but I am also glad that it did exist at some point because I do enjoy hockey fight.

426
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:40,890
Speaker 1: Well, I mean if it never existed that would have been fine too true, but you can't lie.

427
00:26:41,172 --> 00:26:45,532
Speaker 1: I enjoy a night watching a nice hockey fight, but so many Happened.

428
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:49,327
Speaker 1: there are already been so many hockey fights and I can already re-enjoy them.

429
00:26:49,387 --> 00:26:53,161
Speaker 1: Thanks to the magic We don't need any more.

430
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:59,539
Speaker 1: there's already enough that I can get all the enjoyment from hockey fights that I need for my whole life by watching the ones that have already happened.

431
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:06,626
Speaker 1: and Today, I discovered one that is better maybe than any most I have seen top five maybe.

432
00:27:06,686 --> 00:27:20,290
Speaker 1: so this is not in the NHL it's in the ECH L between a hockey team from Tallahassee, which is where versus the Louisiana ice gators.

433
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:26,250
Speaker 1: So these are southern United States hockey teams well below the messier line where hockey does not belong.

434
00:27:29,472 --> 00:27:32,415
Speaker 1: February since it was winter 98 is pretty much like.

435
00:27:32,435 --> 00:27:41,514
Speaker 1: this is near the peak of like the last era of this kind of fight and even though this is a minor league hockey game, it was apparently being broadcast and Commentated.

436
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:44,890
Speaker 1: and whoa, this is some brawl they had here.

437
00:27:45,773 --> 00:27:50,330
Speaker 0: Now frankly even as a kid like minor league hockey had way bigger fights than real hockey.

438
00:27:50,471 --> 00:27:51,335
Speaker 1: It's still true today.

439
00:27:51,716 --> 00:27:53,424
Speaker 1: every time I go to a minor league hockey game.

440
00:27:53,444 --> 00:27:54,208
Speaker 1: There's always a fight.

441
00:27:54,369 --> 00:28:01,150
Speaker 0: the Majority of the Detroit Falcons games I ever went to as a kid had a bench clearing brawl that's halted the game.

442
00:28:01,651 --> 00:28:07,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I'm not the the full real majority of the games I ever saw cleared the benches.

443
00:28:08,632 --> 00:28:11,469
Speaker 0: The best part about this video is the announcers.

444
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:18,333
Speaker 1: It's really weird right because when you get to hockey that's super unprofessional like if you go to the roller hockey down it where I was Taking photos.

445
00:28:18,454 --> 00:28:20,463
Speaker 1: Yeah, you'll never see a fight there cuz the cops will come.

446
00:28:20,483 --> 00:28:22,090
Speaker 1: the cops are actually standing there the whole time.

447
00:28:22,251 --> 00:28:27,279
Speaker 1: I don't think they were looking for fights, but you know the point is You'll be guilty of assault.

448
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:31,183
Speaker 1: They were looking for offsides sure And it's super professional hockey.

449
00:28:31,244 --> 00:28:32,010
Speaker 1: at the top levels.

450
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:37,630
Speaker 1: You see less fighting because people are making a zillion dollars, and they don't need a broken face or a broken leg, right?

451
00:28:38,472 --> 00:28:41,445
Speaker 1: But in the in-between hockey, it's all happy Gilmore.

452
00:28:41,466 --> 00:28:42,390
Speaker 0: Oh, baby.

453
00:28:44,952 --> 00:28:47,750
Speaker 0: So in the meta moment the book the book was the fifth season we did the episode.

454
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:57,863
Speaker 0: Nope, I'm gonna wait until I finish the entire trilogy of this broken earth or whatever the rest of the books from the fifth season because I had just finished the second one.

455
00:28:57,883 --> 00:29:14,210
Speaker 1: and This weekend November 4th and 5th gamer X East LGBT focused gaming convention you do not have to be LGBT or any other have to be in New York and like games and show up and probably not a homophobe.

456
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:18,727
Speaker 1: Homophobe is probably the only people who shouldn't be there, and it's a pretty great con.

457
00:29:18,747 --> 00:29:19,630
Speaker 0: It's very well organized.

458
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:32,879
Speaker 0: We're gonna be doing our writing game rules lecture on Saturday at 3 30 p.m.. In panels B. The only notable thing about this lecture because this is a talk we've given before for the most part Is that because of the nature of this con.

459
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:36,610
Speaker 1: you know relatively metamoment fast is there many moments getting too big okay?

460
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:38,328
Speaker 0: We're gonna actually take questions.

461
00:29:38,912 --> 00:29:42,064
Speaker 0: Well, we normally don't do that so that that is the only reason to attend.

462
00:29:42,104 --> 00:29:44,353
Speaker 0: if you're already listening to the show I'm sad.

463

Speaker 1: on September 17 18 19 packs unplugged.

464
00:29:45,578 --> 00:29:49,694

466
00:29:53,847 --> 00:29:54,910

Speaker 0: Parallel.

468
00:29:56,056 --> 00:29:56,337

479
00:30:45,939 --> 00:30:47,730
Speaker 1: just if you have any brain.

00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,636

Speaker 1: We are the most public you can be on the internet, and you can follow all of our activities.

483
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:58,059
Speaker 0: I'm not as public as what's-his-name in a on flux.

484
00:30:58,199 --> 00:31:05,858
Speaker 1: if you're already so sad that you're listening to geek nights And you're hearing my voice right now Then you might as well just you know be even sadder.

485
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:10,370
Speaker 0: so a nice segue from the meta into our review of an anime shock.

486
00:31:10,571 --> 00:31:11,418
Speaker 0: It's been a while.

487
00:31:11,882 --> 00:31:12,910
Speaker 0: the ancient Magus is bride.

488
00:31:14,391 --> 00:31:26,393
Speaker 0: Part of the reason why we're doing this show and reviewing it is that as you might have noticed on Scott's YouTube channel We have taken the old anime Boston thing where we would review the upcoming season of anime Before

489
00:31:26,473 --> 00:31:27,155
Speaker 1: it came out

490
00:31:27,656 --> 00:31:35,161
Speaker 0: based solely on an image and maybe a paragraph at most Mm-hmm, and we're pretty much always right about these shows.

491
00:31:35,522 --> 00:31:44,579
Speaker 0: so to put our money where our mouth is We're gonna try to review a lot of the shows that we already reviewed on that on that video By actually watching them and see.

492
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:50,604
Speaker 1: if we don't remind me what we said about this show Let's talk about the show and then remind me what we said about it.

493
00:31:50,805 --> 00:31:56,646
Speaker 1: so the ancient You know I don't taint it to like you know agree with myself my heart's kind.

494
00:31:56,666 --> 00:32:04,733
Speaker 0: Oh, you may wish Yeah, if you've seen my heart's guy tie you can figure out what all those words mean and how they line up it literally.

495
00:32:04,894 --> 00:32:09,113
Speaker 0: is the bride of the ancient Magus or mage or magic user?

496
00:32:09,254 --> 00:32:21,330
Speaker 0: yes, and it is the story of a Reason has replaced his head with a deer skull or always had a deer skull that we don't know what he looks like.

497
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,034
Speaker 0: We don't really know.

498
00:32:22,054 --> 00:32:23,020
Speaker 1: yeah at one point.

499
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:28,090
Speaker 1: He does cover it up with like a sheet Yep, so I guess he also uses that magic to hide it from muggles when he's out.

500
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:31,530
Speaker 1: It's a human body with a deer skull for a head.

501
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:45,490
Speaker 1: It's the Skeletor model, but otherwise body skeleton head yes, but otherwise he acts like a nice professor You know very powerful and wise mage who obviously has a lot of secrets and possibly evil ones in his past.

502
00:32:45,792 --> 00:32:47,064
Speaker 0: Meanwhile there's this girl who?

503
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:51,283
Speaker 0: Has sold herself into slavery for reasons right.

504
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,236
Speaker 1: so basically in the first episode It's really structured.

505
00:32:54,296 --> 00:33:00,323
Speaker 1: quite strangely is that they show you the present and introduce these characters But they don't really introduce something to sort of show them right.

506
00:33:00,343 --> 00:33:01,730
Speaker 1: like this is the living situation.

507
00:33:01,831 --> 00:33:11,210
Speaker 1: She lives in a house with this wizard guy and this other thing and this servant Person who's cooking clearly a fairy and this dude who turns into a dog or dog who turns into a dude?

508
00:33:11,571 --> 00:33:14,290
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, right who seemed cool, but you don't know anything about him anyway.

509
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:24,190
Speaker 1: And then that episode and I guess also the second episode Basically are just a flashback to show you like her early life.

510
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:27,752
Speaker 1: It doesn't actually show you how she ended up in this situation It just shows.

511
00:33:27,793 --> 00:33:34,370
Speaker 1: you like her origin story of like you know going from orphan to entering the world of magic ness.

512
00:33:35,103 --> 00:33:38,315
Speaker 0: so the Show itself.

513
00:33:38,355 --> 00:33:46,887
Speaker 1: you know we watch a bunch of episodes so we can review this the way we typically have seen until this episode Where they go to the dragon land which is I'll be three I think or four maybe at most.

514
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:48,209
Speaker 1: on one hand I think it's three.

515
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:51,519
Speaker 0: It's if you describe the plot naively.

516
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:57,689
Speaker 0: it has a few warning signs in the sense of This mage buys a woman out of slavery.

517
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:03,427
Speaker 1: Very young clearly less than 18 year old girl 15. okay to be his wife.

518
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,721
Speaker 1: Yeah, the wife is in the title of the show, but there is.

519
00:34:06,781 --> 00:34:08,710
Speaker 1: I've not seen any wife activity in the show.

520
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:09,618
Speaker 0: What he said.

521
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,810
Speaker 0: I want you to be my wife someday.

522
00:34:11,812 --> 00:34:14,380
Speaker 0: He says this to her like ten times, I don't remember that.

523
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:16,068
Speaker 0: we just watched it.

524
00:34:17,911 --> 00:34:18,913
Speaker 1: I don't remember that part.

525
00:34:19,454 --> 00:34:30,585
Speaker 0: Okay, okay anyway anyway, so uh That aside while that is in the show it does not go in the direction that that might imply.

526
00:34:30,686 --> 00:34:46,030
Speaker 0: It's more like a slice of life show about Really in human beings interacting with each other in parallel to humans in a world where magic is slowly dying Which is very similar actually to the world of Little Witch Academia.

527
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:51,090
Speaker 1: There's also a conflict going on between apparently some evil magic and some good and some not evil magic.

528
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:53,078
Speaker 0: But it's not really clear what all that is the show.

529
00:34:53,138 --> 00:34:54,342
Speaker 1: It's very mysterious like this.

530
00:34:54,362 --> 00:34:56,130
Speaker 1: something's like a dark blobby thing.

531
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:01,790
Speaker 1: That's you know obviously evil attacking some nice library, and you know messing with shit, right?

532
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:09,169
Speaker 0: Well, I guess what you learn about the world you learn from the mage the same way that this girl learns it.

533
00:35:09,229 --> 00:35:19,230
Speaker 0: yep and a lot of the episodes just seem to Introduce over time all these various fantastic like fairies and dragons and other mages and other beings.

534
00:35:19,311 --> 00:35:25,186
Speaker 0: you're not really sure what their deal is and You sort of just see them all interacting and stuff playing out.

535
00:35:25,648 --> 00:35:27,128
Speaker 0: and the thing I think it does very well.

536
00:35:27,451 --> 00:35:37,464
Speaker 0: That I'm very pleased with because this is something that eccentric family did even better is There are inhuman characters who clearly have inhuman sensibilities and do not act like humans.

537
00:35:38,206 --> 00:35:47,786
Speaker 0: the fairies are appropriately dangerous Mm-hmm in the way that a fairy would be expected to be based on the actual fiction about fairies.

538
00:35:47,806 --> 00:35:51,901
Speaker 1: the dragons are dragon e Yep, the super old dragon keeping guy.

539
00:35:51,921 --> 00:35:53,648
Speaker 1: He's a super old dragon keeping guy.

540
00:35:53,748 --> 00:35:59,973
Speaker 0: Yeah He reeks a little bit of the kind of character I would play in the D&D game though, yes Yes, he is.

541
00:36:00,495 --> 00:36:01,560
Speaker 0: everyone has pointed that out.

542
00:36:02,463 --> 00:36:07,607
Speaker 1: the only real negative thing I want to say about this show is that is kind of slow, right?

543
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:14,387
Speaker 0: Yeah, it has a little bit that slice of life feel like we're gonna go to the land of the dragons And it seems like oh, it's not gonna be a good thing.

544
00:36:14,932 --> 00:36:17,750
Speaker 1: It's not that it's slow, and then nothing happens, right?

545
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,758
Speaker 1: It's like I watched one episode and they were.

546
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:22,870
Speaker 1: I learned about dragons and a lot happened and the plot concluded.

547
00:36:23,171 --> 00:36:24,575
Speaker 1: It's like a thing happened right?

548
00:36:25,036 --> 00:36:56,310
Speaker 1: It's just that you'll get these shots and some people can see this as a positive, but I don't Where I see it as a positive actually when it occurs in anime movies where you got a lot shots where it's just like alright look it's a picture of the dragon land and we're panning across a Landscape and listening to noises and some dragons are flying over Right and it's like you're just watching like scenery and setting a mood Right and it and that you stay in that on those sorts of shots for like a good 10 20 seconds something like that.

549
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:59,342
Speaker 1: Right, you know and in anime movies those shots are great.

550
00:36:59,362 --> 00:37:01,450
Speaker 1: You got to open your movie with those, right?

551
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:05,047
Speaker 1: I love an Evangelion, you know, like they'll have the elevator scene.

552
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:05,851
Speaker 1: shit Like.

553
00:37:05,871 --> 00:37:09,784
Speaker 1: well, no shot the ones that all I always remember from evangelical shot.

554
00:37:09,824 --> 00:37:10,547
Speaker 0: You hear the crickets.

555
00:37:10,567 --> 00:37:12,130
Speaker 1: Yes crickets They're cicadas.

556
00:37:12,351 --> 00:37:20,429
Speaker 1: They show the outside the school in the summer and you hear cicadas for a good like five seconds And then they cut inside the school or inside the apartment right after that.

557
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:27,150
Speaker 1: right it's like this show is loaded with shots like that where just Things are physically moving slowly.

558
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:37,250
Speaker 1: They're showing you things happening second by second and creating these, you know We're not plot is not advancing and you're sitting there watching but ostensibly atmosphere is being created.

559
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:40,504
Speaker 1: Right, you're watching for like a good 20 seconds to a minute and nothing.

560
00:37:41,026 --> 00:37:43,689
Speaker 1: No one says anything No one does anything and that happens a lot.

561
00:37:44,212 --> 00:37:48,250
Speaker 1: So like the first two episodes could have been done in one episode if you cut out some of those scenes.

562
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:55,186
Speaker 0: right and that I guess Atmosphere like that kind of atmospheric setting is very common in anime.

563
00:37:55,227 --> 00:37:55,809
Speaker 1: and oh, yeah.

564
00:37:56,592 --> 00:38:01,594
Speaker 1: But I think in this show it like I. it is common in anime I expect it and like it.

565
00:38:01,895 --> 00:38:15,323
Speaker 0: but in this show it was to the extent where I felt it, you know dragging a little bit well because in this show unlike say eccentric family, which does very similar things I Compare these two shows a lot because there's a lot of interesting comparisons to make.

566
00:38:15,443 --> 00:38:17,690
Speaker 1: eccentric family has the fun characters.

567
00:38:17,811 --> 00:38:21,648
Speaker 1: This show does not have any characters that I really liked other than the old dragon guy.

568
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:24,845
Speaker 1: Yeah well I guess we're not the dragon person the actual dragon.

569
00:38:25,268 --> 00:38:44,690
Speaker 0: when Eccentric family who wanted or other or other great anime that I never feel bored at any second watching them Even when they have atmospheric setup shots like that the atmosphere Ties into the allegory or the story of the episode very neatly Or there's some sort of very nice interconnected artistry to it in this show.

570
00:38:45,352 --> 00:38:56,957
Speaker 0: It almost feels like we need atmosphere here it is, but it doesn't tie into any sort of overarching real story Relation or allegory or like.

571
00:38:56,998 --> 00:38:57,960
Speaker 0: it doesn't intertwine.

572
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:03,685
Speaker 1: those shots in Evangelion with the cicadas are reminding you that it's summer Reminding you that there's nobody left here.

573
00:39:03,846 --> 00:39:05,395
Speaker 1: Yeah, right They're like they have a purpose.

574
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:08,270
Speaker 1: if you see it right the ones in this show don't really have a purpose.

575
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:11,602
Speaker 1: They're just sort of like you're sort of like wait like you're just like alright now.

576
00:39:12,084 --> 00:39:13,630
Speaker 1: She's walking towards the library.

577
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:15,037
Speaker 1: Can we get to the library already?

578
00:39:15,057 --> 00:39:19,700
Speaker 0: No, I think part of that is that the as Interesting as the show is again.

579
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,082
Speaker 0: I like it.

580
00:39:20,123 --> 00:39:21,029
Speaker 0: I'm not saying it's a bad show.

581
00:39:21,732 --> 00:39:24,600
Speaker 0: It definitely feels very shallow in that.

582
00:39:25,001 --> 00:39:31,279
Speaker 0: the thing the themes that are being explored the stories everything Doesn't feel like there's that much under them.

583
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,884
Speaker 1: No, it's pretty much just like okay.

584
00:39:32,924 --> 00:39:33,446
Speaker 1: What's the best?

585
00:39:33,587 --> 00:39:34,570
Speaker 0: Oh you went to the dragon land?

586
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,295
Speaker 0: Oh, here's the dragon life cycle.

587
00:39:36,315 --> 00:39:37,859
Speaker 0: Yep, and now we're leaving.

588
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,704
Speaker 0: Yep, and that's kind of it.

589
00:39:40,126 --> 00:39:48,142
Speaker 0: So you get this very long atmospheric scene with this feeling of pathos and Understanding for this old dragon and the life cycle.

590
00:39:48,223 --> 00:39:52,690
Speaker 0: and but at the same time You just met all these characters and it's a throwaway.

591
00:39:52,730 --> 00:40:02,970
Speaker 1: I also created a Chekhov's gun where he's like, oh you're gonna make a branch for me You're gonna take one of my branches to make a magic wand one day and you know that it's some later episode She's gonna come back and make the wand and use it to solve something.

592
00:40:03,552 --> 00:40:10,110
Speaker 0: But because these can these dragons were all introduced in this episode and then I'm leaving them in this episode.

593
00:40:10,713 --> 00:40:13,828
Speaker 0: I didn't really have any real investment in the life cycle.

594
00:40:13,868 --> 00:40:20,689
Speaker 0: That was repeatedly Telegraph by those children child dragons and just really shallow and kind of hamfisted.

595
00:40:20,829 --> 00:40:25,970
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, I mean it's really the main problem is that I just don't like or care about any of the characters.

596
00:40:27,251 --> 00:40:39,107
Speaker 1: I actually cared more about that story where when she was an orphan and the parents broke up because she was like draining on Their family and that mom was all upset like I think something much more tragic happened there that we're gonna.

597
00:40:39,147 --> 00:40:39,849
Speaker 0: we haven't learned yet.

598
00:40:41,431 --> 00:40:52,770
Speaker 1: No, I'm pretty sure it's just that the mom, you know, the the the problems between those two parents were Exacerbated and revealed by them having to actually, you know deal with this problem that they encountered.

599
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:57,023
Speaker 1: I never see those parents and kids again in this in this.

600
00:40:57,063 --> 00:40:59,450
Speaker 0: I suspect we'll see more in flashbacks of that.

601
00:40:59,713 --> 00:41:00,037
Speaker 1: I don't see.

602
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:01,070
Speaker 1: I think we'll see them again.

603
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:09,762
Speaker 1: But the point is I care about them more than I care about the the main girl The guy with the skull head like this terrible secret of space.

604
00:41:09,782 --> 00:41:11,910
Speaker 1: Like why does he have a skull head the main girl?

605
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,093
Speaker 1: I don't care that much.

606
00:41:13,435 --> 00:41:15,864
Speaker 1: I'm like every anime has this terrible secret of space like that.

607
00:41:16,085 --> 00:41:20,777
Speaker 0: The main girl has no Real personality and are only defining characteristics.

608
00:41:20,977 --> 00:41:28,706
Speaker 0: are she's the super powerful thing that we're gonna have a proper noun for yep, and Her past is tragedy.

609
00:41:28,908 --> 00:41:38,467
Speaker 1: Yep and there are some characters who seemed like they cool and might have a good personality like the Dragon-keeping guy and the guy who turns into a dog or dog who turns into a guy.

610
00:41:38,547 --> 00:41:45,670
Speaker 1: I can't tell what the Where dog or dog where I don't know but it's like all they do is show you them for like a few seconds.

611
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:50,290
Speaker 1: They don't really give them the serious attention to make you like them or give you any info.

612
00:41:50,472 --> 00:41:51,550
Speaker 1: I'm sure they'll get their episodes.

613
00:41:51,753 --> 00:41:53,713
Speaker 1: But you know It's like you.

614
00:41:53,733 --> 00:41:59,234
Speaker 1: look at some other anime that has a cast of characters and they introduce a lot more characters a lot sooner and actually Introduce them.

615
00:41:59,275 --> 00:42:00,624
Speaker 0: Yep, but that's it.

616
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:14,795
Speaker 0: It moves slow It has a lot of slice-of-life elements and the actual world building and character development are both actually Pretty shallow and they don't feel like they're all tying together into a deeper Overarching allegorical narrative.

617
00:42:14,855 --> 00:42:18,607
Speaker 0: I feel like it's going to be a very direct non allegorical narrative.

618
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:19,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like usually.

619
00:42:21,651 --> 00:42:26,026
Speaker 1: My gut feeling is that when you have a terrible secret of space thing, right?

620
00:42:26,086 --> 00:42:27,090
Speaker 1: Why does he have a skull head?

621
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:27,753
Speaker 1: What's the deal?

622
00:42:27,773 --> 00:42:30,448
Speaker 1: and you if it's going to be revealed?

623
00:42:30,528 --> 00:42:35,310
Speaker 1: well And you're actually gonna March on this plot that you'll have episodes that March on the plot.

624
00:42:35,974 --> 00:42:42,823
Speaker 1: Right when you get these slice-of-life life episodes It feels to me like it's gonna be one of those not actually ending.

625
00:42:42,863 --> 00:42:44,287
Speaker 1: you're never gonna learn anything, right?

626
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:50,390
Speaker 1: Well part of that is just backdrop cuz cowboy bebop has a lot of slice-of-life type episodes.

627
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:56,770
Speaker 0: But a big difference too is that those episodes the plot didn't advance but the characters did.

628
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:03,589
Speaker 1: Well partly because the characters change even if the world the characters You don't need to know what the terrible secret is.

629
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:08,770
Speaker 0: But in this show the characters haven't really don't really change in any deep way at least not quickly.

630
00:43:09,511 --> 00:43:11,017
Speaker 0: Nor does the world change.

631
00:43:11,237 --> 00:43:13,024
Speaker 0: you're just getting a reveal of.

632
00:43:13,305 --> 00:43:14,410
Speaker 0: here's the deal with this world.

633
00:43:15,293 --> 00:43:17,582
Speaker 0: But that aside the animation is great.

634
00:43:17,783 --> 00:43:20,918
Speaker 0: The the show is beautiful Soundtracks good.

635
00:43:20,958 --> 00:43:21,947
Speaker 0: the opening themes good.

636
00:43:23,513 --> 00:43:24,278
Speaker 0: I like the opening theme.

637
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:29,618
Speaker 0: it it reminds me of some older anime Mmm, I like the opening and closing animations.

638
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,765
Speaker 1: Nah, I don't like the.

639
00:43:31,945 --> 00:43:35,658
Speaker 1: the song is just sort of like a Kind of like the opening song.

640
00:43:35,799 --> 00:43:37,063
Speaker 1: it's not something I'm gonna jam to.

641
00:43:37,686 --> 00:43:39,821
Speaker 0: well, no, I mean if you want a jam You gotta watch Gundam seed.

642
00:43:40,064 --> 00:43:45,284
Speaker 0: Yeah But I guess I'm gonna keep watching it for a while and it's only 12 episodes.

643
00:43:45,324 --> 00:43:46,629
Speaker 0: I think so I can finish it.

644
00:43:47,671 --> 00:43:52,635
Speaker 1: You tell me if you find out why he has a skull head and then tell me why he has a skull head and I'm gonna Watch something else.

645
00:43:52,816 --> 00:43:54,224
Speaker 0: I'll keep watching until I get.

646
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:55,594
Speaker 1: it's not a bad show It's just.

647
00:43:55,654 --> 00:43:58,996
Speaker 1: it's not a show that I'm gonna spend my time When I got all this stuff I can do.

648
00:43:59,056 --> 00:44:07,810
Speaker 0: it uses these scenes that are clearly meant to set an atmosphere And then make you feel a very strong emotion about something that's happening.

649
00:44:08,452 --> 00:44:19,409
Speaker 0: But that strong emotion is not deserved by the show for what it has shown you up to that point Mm-hmm, so it acts like this is a very important moment and this is very somber and you should feel this.

650
00:44:19,973 --> 00:44:29,772
Speaker 0: but you don't feel it intrinsically because They're telling you to feel it and showing you a thing as opposed to making you feel it through the actual evolution of character And story.

651
00:44:30,094 --> 00:44:30,274
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

652
00:44:30,998 --> 00:44:34,189
Speaker 0: That's pretty much the harshest thing I can say about a show that I still kind of like All right.

653
00:44:34,506 --> 00:44:36,991
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean compare the way they you know They.

654
00:44:37,252 --> 00:44:42,070
Speaker 1: they basically literally tell you what the dragon's deal is and the dragon talks and says what his deal is.

655
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:43,636
Speaker 0: I've never been a fan of right.

656
00:44:43,736 --> 00:44:44,358
Speaker 0: Here's the thing.

657
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:45,301
Speaker 0: What's the deal?

658
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:46,726
Speaker 0: deal is explained.

659
00:44:46,907 --> 00:44:47,650
Speaker 0: end of episode.

660
00:44:49,193 --> 00:44:53,443
Speaker 1: That dragon is really similar to for example the robots from La Pita.

661
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:56,826
Speaker 1: now compare how you feel about robots from La Pita to this dragon guy.

662
00:44:57,911 --> 00:45:04,130
Speaker 0: So don't even talk because I've seen both Nao Chica and La Pita in the theater very recently.

663
00:45:04,912 --> 00:45:05,595
Speaker 0: I have some very.

664
00:45:06,076 --> 00:45:13,078
Speaker 0: that's a very good point to make about those robots because the robots in La Pita Get very little actual screen time.

665
00:45:13,439 --> 00:45:14,161
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah almost none.

666
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:18,821
Speaker 0: Their origins are not explained in any explicit way Explicit enough.

667
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:19,677
Speaker 0: No, no, no No.

668
00:45:20,091 --> 00:45:25,510
Speaker 0: So the beauty of La Pita is that the characters are pretty on know worthy like they're just sort of all there to set the world.

669
00:45:25,978 --> 00:45:33,610
Speaker 0: the entire movie The entire movie is this beautiful case study in environmental storytelling.

670
00:45:34,152 --> 00:45:46,387
Speaker 0: You've just the places the characters visit the things that are in the world around them tell this epic story of the rise and fall of civilizations and technology over the endless ages.

671
00:45:46,407 --> 00:45:51,803
Speaker 0: and the story of those individual characters is almost just a way to experience that.

672
00:45:52,284 --> 00:46:01,978
Speaker 0: and the robots have a Very a very complex implied story, but no character says these robots were made for X And this is why why happened.

673
00:46:02,279 --> 00:46:08,927
Speaker 0: but ancient magus bride is literally Dragons work like this and this is why this dragon is turning into a tree.

674
00:46:08,947 --> 00:46:09,308
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

675
00:46:10,151 --> 00:46:11,899
Speaker 0: So yeah, I'll keep watching for a while.

676
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:12,622
Speaker 0: It just happened.

677
00:46:12,642 --> 00:46:13,967
Speaker 1: He turned into a tree while you were here.

678
00:46:14,027 --> 00:46:14,590
Speaker 1: Aren't you lucky?

679
00:46:14,871 --> 00:46:22,068
Speaker 0: Well, I mean isn't that the Galaxy Express of every planet you're getting to is having its existential crisis just at the moment that the train arrived?

680
00:46:23,192 --> 00:46:30,358
Speaker 1: Well a lot of times it's the existential crisis is Not something that's on the planet.

681
00:46:30,679 --> 00:46:31,521
Speaker 1: It's oftentimes.

682
00:46:31,621 --> 00:46:33,146
Speaker 1: It's a small like.

683
00:46:33,186 --> 00:46:34,730
Speaker 1: it's not something that's a planet-wide thing.

684
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:39,875
Speaker 1: It'll be like they encounter a character who's crying in the street and that's you know It's a small crisis.

685
00:46:39,915 --> 00:46:43,910
Speaker 1: that true honor or them coming is the catalyst for the crisis.

686
00:46:44,011 --> 00:46:45,946
Speaker 1: That is also true showed up on the planet.

687
00:46:46,026 --> 00:46:47,889
Speaker 1: therefore trouble.

688
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:49,942
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's alright.

689
00:46:50,205 --> 00:46:50,629
Speaker 0: I enjoy it.

690
00:46:50,712 --> 00:46:58,770
Speaker 1: Okay if you you know If you're the kind of person who watches Animes that aren't a plus animes then watch this one because it's probably better than most of the other ones.

691
00:46:58,971 --> 00:47:00,941
Speaker 0: Also, a lot of people are talking about it.

692
00:47:01,102 --> 00:47:03,790
Speaker 0: So watch at least one or two episodes So you'll know what they're talking about.

693
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:05,857
Speaker 1: It's not something you need to go run out and watch.

694
00:47:05,957 --> 00:47:12,705
Speaker 0: the manga has been recommended to me a lot over for a while So that was part of why I was feeling that a manga would give you more plus.

695
00:47:12,725 --> 00:47:13,830
Speaker 1: you could read it a lot faster.

696
00:47:14,271 --> 00:47:18,325
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the animation and the color and everything is really great in the anime.

697
00:47:18,445 --> 00:47:18,706
Speaker 1: Yes.

698
00:47:18,826 --> 00:47:19,529
Speaker 1: It looks nice.

699
00:47:19,709 --> 00:47:21,516
Speaker 1: Yes It's nice to look at the mod.

700
00:47:21,536 --> 00:47:27,209
Speaker 0: the monster like the dragons and the fairies are just really well animated and cool feast for them eyeballs, especially like the library scenes.

701
00:47:30,087 --> 00:47:36,170
Speaker 0: So Here is the audio from our judge anime by its cover segment on this exact show.

702
00:47:36,615 --> 00:47:37,060
Speaker 0: So, let's see.

703
00:47:37,101 --> 00:47:39,615
Speaker 0: All right, we were No, yum.

704
00:47:39,716 --> 00:47:42,163
Speaker 0: Oh, this is that wife of the magus bride.

705
