1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,910
Speaker 0: *sings along to the song*.

2
00:00:03,693 --> 00:00:04,487
Speaker 0: Alright, that's enough of that.

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,970
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, May 25th, and this is Geek Nights.

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:15,090
Speaker 0: Tonight, the Scott Only Show featuring user feedback and a bunch of meta bits.

5
00:00:16,691 --> 00:00:19,473
Speaker 0: Alright, so if you didn't notice... Oh wait.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,469
Speaker 0: I'm gonna do this.

7
00:00:22,371 --> 00:00:24,609
Speaker 0: Alright, if you didn't notice, I'm alone.

8
00:00:25,451 --> 00:00:30,369
Speaker 0: "Rim went to an amazement, and I'm sure he will absolve himself of all responsibility for this

9
00:00:30,409 --> 00:00:30,650
Speaker 0: show.".

10
00:00:31,671 --> 00:00:33,989
Speaker 0: So, I'm just gonna say that so he doesn't have to.

11
00:00:37,393 --> 00:00:40,250
Speaker 0: Also, um, it's really hard to do a show all alone.

12
00:00:40,851 --> 00:00:44,710
Speaker 0: You don't have anyone else filling in the gaps when you don't have anything to say.

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,130
Speaker 0: You don't have anyone to, you know, respond to the things you say and thus start a dialogue.

14
00:00:51,054 --> 00:00:54,330
Speaker 0: So bear with me and bear with the horrible audio quality.

15
00:00:54,630 --> 00:01:03,250
Speaker 0: I'm recording this with my Logitech headset that I usually use for gaming, plugged into a laptop, sitting on my desk with audacity.

16
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,569
Speaker 0: And I'm not gonna edit it very much.

17
00:01:06,711 --> 00:01:11,190
Speaker 0: So, I'm gonna try to keep this short and as pleasant as possible.

18
00:01:12,451 --> 00:01:17,230
Speaker 0: And hopefully it will be somewhat entertaining and not a complete waste of your time to listen to.

19
00:01:17,932 --> 00:01:27,110
Speaker 0: If you're already feeling pain, just stop listening now, pretend this episode doesn't exist, and listen again next Monday when we'll come back with real shows.

20
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,470
Speaker 0: This is a crap filler, but guess what, it's better than nothing.

21
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:38,190
Speaker 0: Better to have a, you know, if you're doing a webcomic, better to have some crap sketchup when you fail to make a comic than to have nothing.

22
00:01:38,871 --> 00:01:40,209
Speaker 0: So, this is that crap sketch.

23
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:45,710
Speaker 0: I'm sure someone out there will enjoy it, even though most people will ignore it, but that's just fine.

24
00:01:46,972 --> 00:01:49,389
Speaker 0: Alright, let's see, what's in the news today?

25
00:01:51,013 --> 00:02:00,870
Speaker 0: Oh, so Microsoft came out with this new image format called, to compete with JPEG, called WMP for Windows Media Photo.

26
00:02:02,552 --> 00:02:05,002
Speaker 0: And pretty much what they're trying to do is replace JPEG.

27
00:02:08,976 --> 00:02:10,910
Speaker 0: I don't think that's gonna do so well.

28
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:18,909
Speaker 0: I mean, that's like, they tried to replace the MP3 with all kinds of formats, like AAC and WMA, and none of those managed to kick that out.

29
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:52,550
Speaker 0: No, I really don't think anyone in the world, even people who aren't open source zealots, no one is going to opt to use some closed, difficult to use format that only works on some devices, when, by default, every freaking digital camera in the universe, you know, pops JPEGs off of itself, and every freaking image software in the universe, you know, uses JPEGs and supports them fully, when Windows Media Photo will, I guess, not be fully supported by everything.

30
00:02:55,412 --> 00:03:10,430
Speaker 0: I guess, you know, there are, it's true what they do say, that, you know, photographers don't like JPEG because it has all sorts of artifacts, and Windows Media Photo will supposedly have better pictures in smaller image files with less artifacting.

31
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:17,990
Speaker 0: But, you know what, if people want serious photos and such, they don't have to use JPEG.

32
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:33,388
Speaker 0: There are other formats like PNG and TIFF and, you know, even Bitmap that allow you to do lossless or near lossless image storage without screwing around with some new bullshit Microsoft thing that no one in the world uses.

33
00:03:34,411 --> 00:03:38,290
Speaker 0: Plus, the reason JPEG is so popular is that it works just fine on web pages.

34
00:03:38,790 --> 00:04:01,670
Speaker 0: I mean, Firefox doesn't support Windows Media Photo, and what if Microsoft, you know, is Microsoft just going to let Firefox make, or, and Opera and Conquerer and Safari just support Windows Media Photo, here's the code, to render these images, or are they going to require that Firefox pays a license fee to Microsoft if they want, you know, to make these images display in web pages.

35
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:12,290
Speaker 0: And if that's the case, no one's going to freakin' pay the license fee, and Windows Media Photo will bomb, even if it's technically superior in compression and image quality.

36
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:36,169
Speaker 0: This is just another attempt by, you know, Microsoft, which has consistently made profits with proprietary file formats, Adobe also, to go back to that old business model, now that their operating system web browser monopoly isn't really holding up as well as it used to, an Office monopoly also.

37
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,475
Speaker 0: So, we'll see what comes of that.

38
00:04:39,977 --> 00:05:04,869
Speaker 0: My prediction is Windows Media Photo will do no better than Windows Media Audio is currently doing, and people who are super Windows users will use it for their personal photos, but if web browsers and sites like Flickr never support it, it'll never take off, and it'll just be one of those, you know, proprietary file formats no one cares about, except for the people who use it personally.

39
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,161
Speaker 0: Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

40
00:05:10,282 --> 00:05:11,465
Speaker 0: Alright, things of the day.

41
00:05:11,485 --> 00:05:12,729
Speaker 0: I have a thing of the day.

42
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:20,590
Speaker 0: Apparently, in Britain, there are stores that have lots of teens loitering outside the store.

43
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:36,670
Speaker 0: I guess if you're a store owner, that can be a problem, especially if these are, you know, dangerous-looking or scruffy-looking teens, 'cause normal people will be afraid to walk into your store, you know, or kids will block your window display, which attracts customers.

44
00:05:37,951 --> 00:05:41,030
Speaker 0: And, you know, loitering's generally unpleasant if it's outside your store.

45
00:05:41,131 --> 00:05:42,850
Speaker 0: If it's outside someone else's store, who cares?

46
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:57,870
Speaker 0: So what they've done is they've made this, they bought this device, some company is selling it, that produces sound that is at such a high frequency that people can't hear it, except people under 20.

47
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:04,190
Speaker 0: Most people over the age of 20 cannot hear the noise, but most people under 20 can hear the noise.

48
00:06:05,612 --> 00:06:14,560
Speaker 0: So if you're a 40-year-old store owner, you put this thing outside your store, and all the teens standing outside your store have, like, this really annoying ringing in their ear, like, "Ow, ow,

49
00:06:14,763 --> 00:06:14,803
Speaker 0: ow!".

50
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:18,968
Speaker 0: And you don't care, you're a 40-year-old guy who can't hear it.

51
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:20,629
Speaker 0: So you're all good.

52
00:06:23,651 --> 00:06:29,349
Speaker 0: What's happened is that the teens have taken this noise and recorded it.

53
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,650
Speaker 0: And with that recording, they have created cell phone rings.

54
00:06:34,151 --> 00:06:47,869
Speaker 0: Now, if you have a cell phone in your high school or your college or whatever, or your middle school even, and, you know, you have it on vibrate or ring, the teacher is going to hear when you vibrate or ring it.

55
00:06:48,851 --> 00:06:53,309
Speaker 0: But if you use this mosquito noise, only the punk kids can hear it.

56
00:06:54,011 --> 00:07:02,109
Speaker 0: So now, kids in Britain all have cell phones that ring, and only the kids in the class can hear it, and the teacher can't.

57
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:07,590
Speaker 0: So kids are texting each other back and forth in class now, and there's no way for the teacher to know.

58
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:11,986
Speaker 0: I say, "Way to go, awesome hacker

59
00:07:12,027 --> 00:07:12,388
Speaker 0: kids!".

60
00:07:14,132 --> 00:07:15,961
Speaker 0: And the teachers say, "Goddamn

61
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:16,323
Speaker 0: kids!".

62
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:25,288
Speaker 0: "Oh, well, you try to use technology to keep the kids down, and the kids use the same technology to fight back, you get what you

63
00:07:25,328 --> 00:07:25,709
Speaker 0: deserve.".

64
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,636
Speaker 0: So this is just super awesome.

65
00:07:28,017 --> 00:07:29,784
Speaker 0: I hope more things like this happen in the future.

66
00:07:29,844 --> 00:07:31,350
Speaker 0: It's always pleasant.

67
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:45,128
Speaker 0: Okay, today's show is going to be about me reading emails we've received and some things from the forum also that I think might be interesting, if I find any that I want to talk about.

68
00:07:46,831 --> 00:07:50,010
Speaker 0: And then I'm going to go over some meta bits.

69
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,388
Speaker 0: So let's read the first email.

70
00:07:54,310 --> 00:08:02,830
Speaker 0: I'm going to go from the most recently received email to the less recently received emails, and stop when they start to get out of date or boring.

71
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:09,910
Speaker 0: I'm not going to read the entire emails unless they're short, but I'll give you the basic gist of what they say, and I'll reply.

72
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:17,030
Speaker 0: Other shows, other podcasts I've listened to have done this sort of thing in the past, and we haven't, so I think we're due.

73
00:08:17,491 --> 00:08:22,930
Speaker 0: We do get, you know, we don't get a pile of emails like I'd like to, you know, more than I can handle, like other people seem to get.

74
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:27,843
Speaker 0: But we do get plenty of emails, and we don't seem to respond to a lot of them on the air.

75
00:08:28,746 --> 00:08:29,589
Speaker 0: So here we go.

76
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:34,458
Speaker 0: Most recent email is from Daryl at Anime World Order.

77
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,783
Speaker 0: I listen to his show.

78
00:08:35,803 --> 00:08:38,289
Speaker 0: Those are the guys who know a shit ton about anime.

79
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:44,310
Speaker 0: And it seems like every time we do an anime show, he comes and emails us and tells us how we're wrong and all that.

80
00:08:45,971 --> 00:08:49,848
Speaker 0: He's talking about our show where we did the worst anime ever a couple weeks ago.

81
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,499
Speaker 0: He says he wants to keep the emails short.

82
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,184
Speaker 0: I guess he kinda succeeded.

83
00:08:55,245 --> 00:08:56,770
Speaker 0: It's shorter than his previous emails.

84
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:04,670
Speaker 0: You know, he talks about how some shows are MST3K bad, and some are actual bad bad.

85
00:09:06,471 --> 00:09:12,368
Speaker 0: The interesting part here is he talks about three shows that he calls the "Manga Video Holy Trinity of

86
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:12,789
Speaker 0: Suck."

87
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:19,310
Speaker 0: And these are shows that we never heard of, and he says they blow stuff like Lemniar out of the water.

88
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:23,786
Speaker 0: And these are shows "Violence Jack," "Angel Cop," and "Mad

89
00:09:23,846 --> 00:09:24,127
Speaker 0: Bull.".

90
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:37,343
Speaker 0: And knowing the stuff that "Manga Video" put out back in the day, where the best of it was stuff like... I guess they kinda had Akira out, so they're not counting that.

91
00:09:37,383 --> 00:09:39,510
Speaker 0: They put out like "Ninja Scroll" was one of their best things.

92
00:09:40,292 --> 00:09:47,650
Speaker 0: So these must be really, really bad anime that were put out way back in the sci-fi channel anime days.

93
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:53,870
Speaker 0: So, you know, it's very hard to say the worst anime ever if you haven't seen all the anime.

94
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:58,167
Speaker 0: And these are definitely three terrible anime I never even heard of, let alone seen.

95
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:06,170
Speaker 0: He also disagrees with me about "Robot Carnival Sucking," which, yeah, alright, that's fine.

96
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:14,910
Speaker 0: But I just think it's really... it's just boring and drawn out and, you know, it's a bunch of little bits about robots.

97
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:22,490
Speaker 0: And they all try to be, you know, meaningful or clever or metaphorical in some way.

98
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:29,450
Speaker 0: But it's really just compared to other shows that combine shorts into one big show.

99
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,116
Speaker 0: This one's pretty much the worst.

100
00:10:31,156 --> 00:10:34,450
Speaker 0: You got, you know, "Memories" kicks the shit out of it, you know, by far.

101
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,152
Speaker 0: So, yeah.

102
00:10:38,116 --> 00:10:47,670
Speaker 0: And then the last thing he talks about is how I said that, you know, if a show has at least good art, or if it has at least good music, it's not the worst show ever.

103
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:52,148
Speaker 0: And he's like, "Oh, but there are shows like 'Odin' which looks amazing, yet is

104
00:10:52,188 --> 00:10:52,610
Speaker 0: terrible.".

105
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:53,393
Speaker 0: And that's true,

106
00:10:53,574 --> 00:10:54,117
Speaker 0: "Odin.".

107
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,684
Speaker 0: "Odin!"

108
00:10:56,066 --> 00:10:56,829
Speaker 0: is a terrible show.

109
00:10:57,971 --> 00:11:03,250
Speaker 0: But, you know, it can't be the worst ever if you have something good to say about it.

110
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,900
Speaker 0: Because there are shows out there that have nothing good to say about them.

111
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,330
Speaker 0: Bad art, bad music, bad plot, bad everything.

112
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:20,450
Speaker 0: And those shows are objectively, you know, not on a favorite scale, 'cause there might be someone who loves it, but on a best and worst scale, they're objectively worse.

113
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:27,750
Speaker 0: Because if one show has good art and nothing else good, and one show has nothing good, the show with good art is better and therefore not the worst ever.

114
00:11:28,492 --> 00:11:33,690
Speaker 0: But there is a point at which the other parts of the show are so bad.

115
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:41,633
Speaker 0: So a show with good art and nothing else redeeming, and a show with nothing redeeming... Uh, no, hang on.

116
00:11:41,873 --> 00:11:51,230
Speaker 0: A show with good art, nothing else redeeming, but a horrendous, horrendous, horrendous plot, and a show with nothing redeeming, but none of it is really horrendous?

117
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:57,417
Speaker 0: Those could be even, because the bad plot could detract from the good art, which is pretty.

118
00:11:57,437 --> 00:11:59,389
Speaker 0: what Odin, that's what Odin does, for sure.

119
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:00,671
Speaker 0: But yeah.

120
00:12:01,874 --> 00:12:03,197
Speaker 0: And the last thing he says is funny.

121
00:12:03,297 --> 00:12:10,599
Speaker 0: He says, "I guess in the end we may never be able to all agree on what the worst anime ever made is, but at the very least we can agree on something.

122
00:12:11,161 --> 00:12:11,402
Speaker 0: M.D.

123
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:12,486
Speaker 0: Geist is the second

124
00:12:12,527 --> 00:12:12,808
Speaker 0: worst.".

125
00:12:13,932 --> 00:12:15,476
Speaker 0: I don't know anyone who would disagree.

126
00:12:15,496 --> 00:12:16,478
Speaker 0: I've never seen M.D.

127
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:16,920
Speaker 0: Geist.

128
00:12:17,421 --> 00:12:18,203
Speaker 0: I know what it is.

129
00:12:18,223 --> 00:12:20,730
Speaker 0: I've seen it, tapes of it around.

130
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:21,975
Speaker 0: I know it's bad.

131
00:12:21,996 --> 00:12:24,110
Speaker 0: I think that's good enough.

132
00:12:25,351 --> 00:12:29,810
Speaker 0: Alright, let's see what the next anime we've got, uh, next anime, the next email.

133
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,249
Speaker 0: It's from, uh, oh, from Sahand Dilemapur.

134
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,362
Speaker 0: I'm usually better at pronouncing things than other people.

135
00:12:38,663 --> 00:12:40,490
Speaker 0: Better at pronouncing people's names anyway.

136
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:49,558
Speaker 0: I don't think that was absolutely correct, but I think it's better than what most Amer- I like, I'd like to say, that's better than how most Americans pronounce it.

137
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:55,440
Speaker 0: So, Sahand, I'm sorry if I mispronounced your name, but that's- I'm gonna go with Sahand.

138
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,990
Speaker 0: So, that's what your name looks like phonetically.

139
00:12:59,470 --> 00:12:59,832
Speaker 0: Let's see.

140
00:12:59,852 --> 00:13:01,902
Speaker 0: "It's the first time I'm writing you guys.

141
00:13:01,963 --> 00:13:03,390
Speaker 0: I admit that I'm a hardcore socialist.

142
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,227
Speaker 0: I love your shows and I think you guys kick

143
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:05,490
Speaker 0: ass.".

144
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,730
Speaker 0: Well, it's nice that you think we kick ass because we're definitely not socialists.

145
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,472
Speaker 0: That's for sure.

146
00:13:11,532 --> 00:13:20,810
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm pretty capitalist, especially, you know, now that I have a copy of Adam Smith's, uh, Wealth of Nations.

147
00:13:21,412 --> 00:13:28,413
Speaker 0: When you read it and you compare it to what teachers said about Adam Smith in high school, where they said, "Oh, he's laissez faire.

148
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:32,125
Speaker 0: He doesn't want any, you know, regulation of economy whatsoever.

149
00:13:32,305 --> 00:13:33,429
Speaker 0: Everyone does whatever they

150
00:13:33,469 --> 00:13:33,650
Speaker 0: want.".

151
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:34,613
Speaker 0: Well, that's not true.

152
00:13:35,756 --> 00:13:39,587
Speaker 0: Once you actually read the Wealth of Nations, capitalism makes a whole lot of sense.

153
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:48,830
Speaker 0: when you consider, you know, if you look at the Communist Manifesto, I make this joke to rim all the time, it's really small, really, really tiny.

154
00:13:49,392 --> 00:13:52,442
Speaker 0: If you look at the Wealth of Nations, it's really, really big.

155
00:13:52,723 --> 00:13:54,990
Speaker 0: This thing is, like, tremendous.

156
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,321
Speaker 0: Like, war and peace big, we're talking here.

157
00:14:00,124 --> 00:14:01,670
Speaker 0: And it's pretty cheap, go get it on Amazon.

158
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:15,150
Speaker 0: Um, Adam Smith thought of fucking everything when he wrote the Wealth of Nations and came up with, you know, he didn't come up with capitalism per se, but when he wrote the book on capitalism, you know, he thought of everything.

159
00:14:15,512 --> 00:14:15,914
Speaker 0: Marx?

160
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:16,999
Speaker 0: Really?

161
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:17,944
Speaker 0: He didn't think of everything.

162
00:14:17,964 --> 00:14:19,150
Speaker 0: That's why his book is really tiny.

163
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:24,870
Speaker 0: You know, and there's an old quote that a lot of people attribute to Winston Churchill, I think.

164
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:30,689
Speaker 0: But I'm not, I've seen things around the internet saying he didn't say it, he did say it, someone else said it.

165
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,598
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter who said it, the quote is still a good quote.

166
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:40,679
Speaker 0: The quote is, if you're under, it goes something like this, "If you're under 20 and you're not a socialist, you have no heart.

167
00:14:41,001 --> 00:14:43,569
Speaker 0: And if you're over 20 and you're still a socialist, you have no

168
00:14:43,609 --> 00:14:43,910
Speaker 0: brain.".

169
00:14:45,431 --> 00:14:53,370
Speaker 0: And while, obviously, it's not some holy truth, you can see, you know, what the, uh, where the quote comes from.

170
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:59,090
Speaker 0: It's that people with a lot of compassion, you know, for others, they want socialism.

171
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:07,050
Speaker 0: You know, because it feels like, alright, if everyone gets the same amount of money, you know, it feels like a really utopia type of thing.

172
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:12,230
Speaker 0: Everyone, no one's poor, no one's homeless, everyone's got what they need, it's all good.

173
00:15:13,473 --> 00:15:27,650
Speaker 0: The sad truth is that it doesn't really work that way, and the people who believe in capitalism, you know, like myself, we say things like, you know, it's justice, everyone gets what they deserve, which also seems really fair and utopia in a certain way.

174
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,657
Speaker 0: The difference is, it can kind of work.

175
00:15:31,921 --> 00:15:35,090
Speaker 0: So, yeah, I just went on a crazy rant.

176
00:15:35,712 --> 00:15:40,710
Speaker 0: Uh, then he starts to talk about Che Guevara, who I think we mentioned on the show a couple times.

177
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:51,390
Speaker 0: Uh, he says Che was a doctor, he met Fidel, you know, and all the, he talks about what Che did, and he tries to clear up some conspiracies about Che.

178
00:15:52,691 --> 00:15:56,045
Speaker 0: Uh, I'm not gonna read it all because I don't know how much of it is true.

179
00:15:56,105 --> 00:16:04,684
Speaker 0: He didn't cite any sources, I didn't have time to go do research to see what was true and what wasn't, but just from reading it gives me the feeling that he's not 100% on target.

180
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:26,619
Speaker 0: So I just like to tell everyone out there, if you're really interested in Che Guevara and anything about him, you know, there's Wikipedia you can read, which I guess is slightly reliable, and there's probably a whole bunch of books on him, and I recommend you read at least two, because then read one book where he's a hero and read one book where he's a villain, and you'll probably arrive somewhere really close to the truth.

181
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:29,649
Speaker 0: I just don't really care that much to go into it.

182
00:16:30,893 --> 00:16:35,970
Speaker 0: Uh, then he talks, the last part of his email, random story, last, I'm gonna read his email.

183
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:40,949
Speaker 0: Random story, last night I was in Walmart comparing prices on a couple DS games, and this mom and her son come up to me.

184
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:45,870
Speaker 0: The dude was about 20-something based on his looks, or he just had a lot of facial hair, in parentheses.

185
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:53,310
Speaker 0: The mom was like, ask him what's good, he seems like he knows his make-flipping gesture with her hands, video stuff.

186
00:16:54,410 --> 00:17:00,836
Speaker 0: So I went on rambling and started pointing out games I thought would kick ass, and we started talking about that game Brain Age, the one that makes you smarter.

187
00:17:01,859 --> 00:17:02,461
Speaker 0: Carrot, carrot.

188
00:17:02,983 --> 00:17:04,689
Speaker 0: Then, suggested some games for the PS2.

189
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:11,589
Speaker 0: Personally, I'm a Nintendo fan, but the kid had a PS2, and I just recently bought one because of Final Fantasy XII, waiting for it, so yeah.

190
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:18,810
Speaker 0: The dude who works at Walmart is just standing there, and I went on talking about 10-15 minutes to these random people I've never seen before.

191
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:24,349
Speaker 0: Then I realized, walking away from that conversation, holy shit, I really ought to work at a video game store.

192
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:26,074
Speaker 0: I was kind of entertained by that event.

193
00:17:26,134 --> 00:17:35,096
Speaker 0: Well, I think I'm not going to read any more emails word-for-word like that, because that was not pleasant, and I'm sure it wasn't entertaining for you out there.

194
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:40,250
Speaker 0: But yeah, when me and Rym go to stores, we talk to people all the time.

195
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:48,470
Speaker 0: We'll go to Best Buy, and if we see someone looking at the $200 power strip, we'll tell them how stupid it is, and how it's no different than the $2 power strips.

196
00:17:48,851 --> 00:17:55,250
Speaker 0: And me going to video game stores, we'll chat it up with the video game guys, you know, the employees, the customers, everyone.

197
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:11,490
Speaker 0: You know, that's really the advantage of going to - one of the only reasons I still go to a brick-and-mortar store, as opposed to buying everything online, is that there are people there, and you can interact with the people in fun ways, as long as it's not a painful place like Walmart, where I would never, ever go.

198
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,922
Speaker 0: If Walmart was the last store on Earth, I wouldn't shop there.

199
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:15,450
Speaker 0: I would start a subsistence farm instead.

200
00:18:17,632 --> 00:18:18,415
Speaker 0: Um, yeah.

201
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:21,705
Speaker 0: Moving on to the next email.

202
00:18:21,746 --> 00:18:22,849
Speaker 0: Let's see what we got here.

203
00:18:25,451 --> 00:18:29,059
Speaker 0: Okay, here's one from Brian Littecky.

204
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,204
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter what his last name is.

205
00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:33,750
Speaker 0: His email's pretty short.

206
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,761
Speaker 0: "What program do you guys use to keep track of web pages?

207
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:37,745
Speaker 0: Thanks, Brian.

208
00:18:37,805 --> 00:18:38,127
Speaker 0: You guys

209
00:18:38,187 --> 00:18:38,408
Speaker 0: rock.".

210
00:18:39,131 --> 00:18:40,273
Speaker 0: Oh, we do indeed rock.

211
00:18:40,433 --> 00:18:41,616
Speaker 0: I wish I rocked harder.

212
00:18:41,636 --> 00:18:46,106
Speaker 0: I mean, if I hadn't given up the guitar after 5th grade, I would rock more.

213
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:47,870
Speaker 0: But, alright.

214
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,255
Speaker 0: "What program do I use to keep track of web

215
00:18:50,275 --> 00:18:50,576
Speaker 0: pages?".

216
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:59,250
Speaker 0: Well, not exactly - that's not a very specific question, so I'm not 100% sure what he means, but just so everyone out there knows, me and Rim use a website called Delicious.

217
00:18:59,851 --> 00:19:06,323
Speaker 0: H-T-T-P slash slash D-E-L dot I-C-I-O dot U-S.

218
00:19:07,025 --> 00:19:09,710
Speaker 0: This is a website that is very cool and everyone should know about.

219
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:12,863
Speaker 0: I don't know, I think we might have talked about it in a show past.

220
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:14,210
Speaker 0: I don't know if we did a whole show on it.

221
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,936
Speaker 0: We probably will in the future.

222
00:19:16,057 --> 00:19:18,690
Speaker 0: It must have been an early show where we talked about it, though, very early.

223
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,596
Speaker 0: Maybe one of the first few weeks of Geek Nights.

224
00:19:21,439 --> 00:19:24,370
Speaker 0: Where, um, Delicious is a site that you do bookmarks.

225
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:30,970
Speaker 0: Now, when you do bookmarks in your web browser, those are useful for websites you visit every day, because they're right there.

226
00:19:31,651 --> 00:19:35,610
Speaker 0: So, no matter what web page you're at, you go bookmarks, you click on the link, and you're there.

227
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:42,470
Speaker 0: Stuff like Dig, which you would read every day, or Gmail, which you would go to all the time, are good things to put in your web browser bookmarks.

228
00:19:43,210 --> 00:20:00,198
Speaker 0: Back in the day before Delicious existed, when you found an interesting site, maybe an article you wanted to read later, or perhaps a site with a how-to guide, or a cheat sheet for a particular programming language, or a technology piece of software, or a site with a funny video on it.

229
00:20:00,278 --> 00:20:05,470
Speaker 0: Now, you want to bookmark it so you can remember it at some point in the future, but you don't want to clutter up your bookmarks in your web browser.

230
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:10,710
Speaker 0: Delicious is a site where you basically make social bookmarks, so it's even better.

231
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:14,462
Speaker 0: You use it, you get an account, and you add links to it.

232
00:20:14,663 --> 00:20:16,390
Speaker 0: And you can add as many links as you want forever.

233
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:24,830
Speaker 0: And you can access those links, and all those bookmarks, from any web browser in the world, because you just go to the Delicious web page, you log in, and there's all your bookmarks that you've ever made.

234
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,615
Speaker 0: Now, you can also tag those bookmarks.

235
00:20:28,036 --> 00:20:33,990
Speaker 0: So, if I tag a funny video, I put the tags "Funny Video," and let's say it's a video game commercial.

236
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:34,856
Speaker 0: I say "Video Game

237
00:20:34,876 --> 00:20:35,300
Speaker 0: Commercial.".

238
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,469
Speaker 0: I put four tags on it.

239
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:43,830
Speaker 0: Now, people can go to Delicious and search for "Funny Video Game Commercials," and they'll find my link, and maybe link it themselves.

240
00:20:44,031 --> 00:20:46,770
Speaker 0: And when things get a lot of links, they show up on the popular page.

241
00:20:47,415 --> 00:20:48,650
Speaker 0: And it's all around very useful.

242
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:56,090
Speaker 0: And if you'll notice, if you go to dell.ico.us/apreche, or slash, I think, rim.

243
00:20:57,151 --> 00:20:58,583
Speaker 0: Oh, I don't know if he uses rim or shazar.

244
00:20:58,603 --> 00:20:59,370
Speaker 0: I think it's slash rim.

245
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:04,110
Speaker 0: You can see the things that me and rim, and you can go to other people's Delicious and see what they're tagging.

246
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:08,530
Speaker 0: And you can also look for combinations of tags, and it's really great.

247
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:11,090
Speaker 0: If you're not using Delicious, you really, really should.

248
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:16,769
Speaker 0: Plus, it'll occasionally, or frequently, give you insight as to what the news and things of the day are going to be.

249
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,230
Speaker 0: So, that's Delicious.

250
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,477
Speaker 0: Next email.

251
00:21:21,518 --> 00:21:23,229
Speaker 0: I'm only going to do a couple more of these.

252
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:25,509
Speaker 0: Let's try this one.

253
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:28,743
Speaker 0: Oh, this one?

254
00:21:28,783 --> 00:21:33,300
Speaker 0: There was a guy from Bangkok, and he was troubled downloading our shows.

255
00:21:34,281 --> 00:21:38,100
Speaker 0: We post this show on Libsyn, if there's any, the MP3s at least.

256
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,379
Speaker 0: The website is run by me.

257
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:45,100
Speaker 0: So, if you have a problem with the website or forums, that is an issue for me, Scott, and you should tell me about it.

258
00:21:45,781 --> 00:21:54,880
Speaker 0: If there is an issue with downloading the MP3s, or emailing us, which shouldn't be anything you'll ever have to worry about, that's a problem with Libsyn or Google.

259
00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:01,280
Speaker 0: And if there's a problem with our RSS feeds, that's probably an issue with FeedBurner, or it might be an issue with me, depending.

260
00:22:02,301 --> 00:22:06,280
Speaker 0: But, we fix the problems on our end, so if there's any new problems, it's FeedBurner's problem.

261
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:12,640
Speaker 0: And if you're not using the FeedBurner feeds to listen to us, you probably should, unless you don't use feeds at all.

262
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,595
Speaker 0: In which case, maybe you should learn how to use the RSS feeds.

263
00:22:15,796 --> 00:22:16,460
Speaker 0: It's really useful.

264
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:24,640
Speaker 0: So, he had trouble downloading the episodes from Bangkok, and all I can say is that's a problem somewhere between Libsyn and Bangkok.

265
00:22:25,421 --> 00:22:28,214
Speaker 0: And, I'm sorry, I can't help you.

266
00:22:28,415 --> 00:22:29,480
Speaker 0: It's out of my hands.

267
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,926
Speaker 0: Libsyn isn't the greatest company.

268
00:22:31,966 --> 00:22:35,480
Speaker 0: We only use them because there aren't any decent alternatives.

269
00:22:36,343 --> 00:22:40,580
Speaker 0: And as soon as there is a decent alternative, we'll be sure to go jump on that.

270
00:22:42,601 --> 00:22:45,478
Speaker 0: Alright, let's see if I got another interesting email here.

271
00:22:51,045 --> 00:22:51,425
Speaker 0: Hmm.

272
00:22:51,445 --> 00:22:52,066
Speaker 0: Hmm.

273
00:22:52,126 --> 00:22:55,090
Speaker 0: Oh my god, I'm losing air time because Rym isn't here.

274
00:22:57,812 --> 00:23:08,090
Speaker 0: Oh, someone did email us trying to have us interview this guy and sell something, but we're going to do a special episode later about shilling, where we will cover all of that.

275
00:23:08,992 --> 00:23:10,129
Speaker 0: So, don't you worry.

276
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,436
Speaker 0: Oh, here's a guy, Olaf Ahlberg.

277
00:23:13,456 --> 00:23:18,170
Speaker 0: This will be the last email I read, then I'll do meta bits, and then I will spare you any more suffering.

278
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:22,439
Speaker 0: "I started listening to podcasts when he got his broadband connection a month ago.

279
00:23:22,459 --> 00:23:24,445
Speaker 0: He listened to all our shows.

280
00:23:25,047 --> 00:23:25,970
Speaker 0: He has some suggestions.

281
00:23:26,951 --> 00:23:31,230
Speaker 0: At one point, Rym says he has some sort of special and in-depth knowledge of propaganda and/or commercial.

282
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:32,724
Speaker 0: That would be very interesting to hear

283
00:23:32,784 --> 00:23:33,006
Speaker 0: about.".

284
00:23:33,511 --> 00:23:35,968
Speaker 0: Yeah, we know a whole lot about that sort of stuff.

285
00:23:38,112 --> 00:23:41,163
Speaker 0: But if you really want to know about that sort of thing, there are plenty of books.

286
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:42,910
Speaker 0: One day we'll do a show about it.

287
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:49,869
Speaker 0: Maybe we can do a month where every Thursday we'll talk about... You know, that can go well with our shilling show.

288
00:23:50,832 --> 00:23:55,430
Speaker 0: It probably won't be the same show, but it can be related in terms of a persuasion series.

289
00:23:55,610 --> 00:24:02,070
Speaker 0: I remember Rym took a whole bunch of classes in persuasion in college, and I've read all of Rushkoff's books, Coercion and such.

290
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:09,070
Speaker 0: So we could, you know, maybe make a month where every Thursday is somehow related to persuasion and arguing and that sort of thing.

291
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,258
Speaker 0: I think people would enjoy that.

292
00:24:10,278 --> 00:24:11,003
Speaker 0: That's a good idea.

293
00:24:11,023 --> 00:24:11,848
Speaker 0: I'll write that down.

294
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:13,736
Speaker 0: "Quite a few...".

295
00:24:14,139 --> 00:24:15,310
Speaker 0: Oh, this email is pretty old.

296
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,153
Speaker 0: "Quite a few shows.

297
00:24:16,194 --> 00:24:18,905
Speaker 0: back, you mentioned something about doing a show about computer securities.

298
00:24:18,946 --> 00:24:19,930
Speaker 0: Looking forward to it since.

299
00:24:20,491 --> 00:24:26,682
Speaker 0: The fact that I've gone through all your shows should be evidence of enough of my appreciation of it, but just to make sure I'm going to say it straight out, I really like your show.

300
00:24:26,742 --> 00:24:27,486
Speaker 0: I'm looking forward to the next

301
00:24:27,546 --> 00:24:27,928
Speaker 0: episode.".

302
00:24:28,471 --> 00:24:29,376
Speaker 0: Well, that's awesome.

303
00:24:29,396 --> 00:24:30,160
Speaker 0: Ooh, he's from Sweden.

304
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:31,507
Speaker 0: Yeah, Sweden's awesome.

305
00:24:31,688 --> 00:24:31,990
Speaker 0: Alright.

306
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,081
Speaker 0: I think they actually won some big hockey, too.

307
00:24:35,403 --> 00:24:36,509
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like the hockeys.

308
00:24:37,992 --> 00:24:40,430
Speaker 0: We did mention something about doing a show about computer security.

309
00:24:41,451 --> 00:24:44,326
Speaker 0: There is a show, a podcast out there called Security Now.

310
00:24:44,406 --> 00:24:45,230
Speaker 0: It's pretty popular.

311
00:24:46,192 --> 00:24:48,810
Speaker 0: And all they do is talk about security on that podcast.

312
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:52,670
Speaker 0: So if you're really, really interested in computer security, I recommend you listen to that show.

313
00:24:53,131 --> 00:24:58,009
Speaker 0: I used to listen to it and then I stopped because it really speaks to a lower level than the level that I'm at.

314
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:01,422
Speaker 0: But it was a good refresher for while I listened to it.

315
00:25:01,864 --> 00:25:03,030
Speaker 0: It just got kind of boring.

316
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:08,587
Speaker 0: Also, the guy who does the podcast is a security professional.

317
00:25:08,627 --> 00:25:09,370
Speaker 0: He knows his shit.

318
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:13,670
Speaker 0: But sometimes he can be a little off the mark in some cases.

319
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:18,650
Speaker 0: We will do a show... The problem with computer security is that it's a really broad topic.

320
00:25:19,232 --> 00:25:27,330
Speaker 0: But we will do a show in the future probably about... Maybe we'll do it in our series of how computers work.

321
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:32,090
Speaker 0: But we'll definitely do some sort of show about how to keep your personal computer secure.

322
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:35,510
Speaker 0: And another show about how to keep your home network secure.

323
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,868
Speaker 0: Or maybe we'll combine them into one show.

324
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:45,990
Speaker 0: Just, you know, practical security things you can do as a normal computer user and not as a professional.

325
00:25:47,851 --> 00:25:49,817
Speaker 0: Alright, that's enough emails.

326
00:25:50,479 --> 00:25:53,930
Speaker 0: Let's cover the meta bits and be done with this.

327
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:57,030
Speaker 0: The first meta bit, we have a website.

328
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,449
Speaker 0: Yes, if you've never listened to Eatnights before.

329
00:26:00,212 --> 00:26:03,830
Speaker 0: Or if you've never been to our website because you subscribe to us in iTunes.

330
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:08,030
Speaker 0: And you never have gone to see what we're about.

331
00:26:08,391 --> 00:26:20,829
Speaker 0: If you go to FrontRowCrew.com, F-R-O-N-T-R-O-W-C-R-E-W.com If you go there, there is an awesome, awesome webpage awaiting you.

332
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:27,050
Speaker 0: Not only are there links to all our feeds and all sorts of other goody, goody stuffs.

333
00:26:28,314 --> 00:26:30,289
Speaker 0: Every single episode is listed there.

334
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,361
Speaker 0: You can search through our episodes.

335
00:26:32,421 --> 00:26:33,830
Speaker 0: Maybe there was something we talked about.

336
00:26:34,651 --> 00:26:35,394
Speaker 0: You can see.

337
00:26:35,434 --> 00:26:39,370
Speaker 0: there are links to My Flicker, My Delicious, My Lestalle, RimsDelicious.

338
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:42,330
Speaker 0: You can browse episodes by category.

339
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:45,109
Speaker 0: And also, there are notes for each show.

340
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:53,590
Speaker 0: So, in each show notes, there are links to the news stories, links to the episode, and links to the things of the day.

341
00:26:54,831 --> 00:26:57,510
Speaker 0: A lot of people, you know, hear us talk about the things of the day.

342
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:00,669
Speaker 0: And I'm not sure if they actually go look at the things of the day.

343
00:27:01,772 --> 00:27:04,530
Speaker 0: I will sit here describing some funny Google video.

344
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,806
Speaker 0: And people don't go out and watch it.

345
00:27:08,152 --> 00:27:08,807
Speaker 0: I don't know.

346
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:13,550
Speaker 0: You should go to FrontRowCrew.com and you will find the link to the thing of the day.

347
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:16,150
Speaker 0: And you can go check it out yourself and be entertained.

348
00:27:16,911 --> 00:27:20,110
Speaker 0: If you're not doing that, you're really not getting the full Geek Nights experience.

349
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:26,450
Speaker 0: Also, on FrontRowCrew.com are our RSS feeds, which I just said.

350
00:27:27,052 --> 00:27:31,070
Speaker 0: And in case you didn't know, there are one, two, three, four, five, six feeds.

351
00:27:31,771 --> 00:27:33,289
Speaker 0: One feed is the blog feed.

352
00:27:33,631 --> 00:27:35,350
Speaker 0: That has an orange icon next to it.

353
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,190
Speaker 0: All the feeds are on FeedBurner, by the way.

354
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:39,930
Speaker 0: You should not be using any, except for the blog feed.

355
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:46,030
Speaker 0: You should not be using any non-FeedBurner feeds for the purposes of podcast subscribing.

356
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:49,110
Speaker 0: If you do, it's not going to work.

357
00:27:49,671 --> 00:27:57,950
Speaker 0: So if you are trying to download our episodes automatically, only use the FeedBurner feeds, which we link to on the right side of FrontRowCrew.com.

358
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:05,030
Speaker 0: There's also the blog feed, which is all the stories on FrontRowCrew.com.

359
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:09,810
Speaker 0: Some of those don't actually have episodes in them.

360
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:17,349
Speaker 0: For example, the top story on FrontRowCrew.com right now is Rym saying he's going to Animazement and that you should find him there.

361
00:28:17,953 --> 00:28:24,148
Speaker 0: If you only subscribe to the podcast feed and you didn't listen to yesterday's episode or today's episode, you probably won't know that.

362
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:32,010
Speaker 0: So subscribing to the blog feed is a good idea for seeing the stories and things we post that aren't podcast episodes.

363
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:37,150
Speaker 0: Also, in the future, there might be more FrontRowCrew productions other than Geek Nights.

364
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,396
Speaker 0: In fact, I'm positive.

365
00:28:38,436 --> 00:28:41,090
Speaker 0: in the long run there will be multiple FrontRowCrew productions.

366
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:48,150
Speaker 0: And subscribing to the blog feed is a way to keep informed of everything that we and our friends do and not just Geek Nights.

367
00:28:49,192 --> 00:28:52,390
Speaker 0: The other five feeds are the all Geek Nights feed and then the daily feeds.

368
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:57,788
Speaker 0: I'm sure everyone knows about these, but I'll talk about them again because our podcast is a little different from everyone else's.

369
00:28:58,472 --> 00:29:04,158
Speaker 0: If you want to listen to every episode of Geek Nights, you just subscribe to the all Geek Nights feed in your podcatcher and you're all set.

370
00:29:04,199 --> 00:29:05,090
Speaker 0: You'll get every episode.

371
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,829
Speaker 0: There are four other feeds.

372
00:29:07,111 --> 00:29:09,430
Speaker 0: One of them will just get you the episodes on Monday.

373
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:13,090
Speaker 0: One will just get you the episodes on Tuesday, just Wednesday, and just Thursday.

374
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:15,969
Speaker 0: There are four feeds, four days of the week.

375
00:29:16,453 --> 00:29:19,370
Speaker 0: You can listen or choose to listen to only one day of the week.

376
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:23,129
Speaker 0: I know a lot of people only care about gaming, so they only subscribe to the Tuesday feed.

377
00:29:25,051 --> 00:29:28,290
Speaker 0: Of all the daily feeds, the gaming one is the most popular.

378
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,069
Speaker 0: The anime one's a close second.

379
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:32,710
Speaker 0: The Monday and Thursday aren't as popular, really.

380
00:29:33,511 --> 00:29:37,529
Speaker 0: Of course, nothing really compares to the all Geek Nights feed, so I guess that's a good thing.

381
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:42,570
Speaker 0: Also, on FrontRowCrew.com is our forum.

382
00:29:43,111 --> 00:29:45,029
Speaker 0: Now, a lot of people have been joining our forum.

383
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:49,170
Speaker 0: We've had a steady income of users pretty much constantly.

384
00:29:49,732 --> 00:29:55,448
Speaker 0: Every day, maybe a couple times a day, I'll see a new person say, "I want to join the

385
00:29:55,488 --> 00:29:55,730
Speaker 0: forum.".

386
00:29:55,992 --> 00:29:57,786
Speaker 0: I say, "Okay, you can join the

387
00:29:57,826 --> 00:29:58,128
Speaker 0: forum.".

388
00:29:58,652 --> 00:30:01,430
Speaker 0: There seems to be steady discussion going on in there.

389
00:30:02,111 --> 00:30:11,689
Speaker 0: You can't check the forum twice without seeing a new article, or a new thread, or a new comment in an existing thread that you care about.

390
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:13,689
Speaker 0: It's really hopping.

391
00:30:14,812 --> 00:30:25,269
Speaker 0: It's not easy to get a community started like this, so the fact that this one is thriving pretty well makes me kind of happy, especially since it's really fun in there.

392
00:30:26,794 --> 00:30:30,750
Speaker 0: If you want to get the full Geek Nights experience, again, you should also join our forum.

393
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:40,069
Speaker 0: Now, just as a note, if you use Hotmail, the way the forum works, it's not like other PHP BB forums that you're used to, or VBulletin forums that you're used to.

394
00:30:40,592 --> 00:30:51,750
Speaker 0: The way our forum works is there's all sorts of fancy features, which is cool, but the way it works is you sign up, and then I or Rym, probably me, will manually approve your application.

395
00:30:52,491 --> 00:30:54,910
Speaker 0: I have never, ever, ever rejected an application.

396
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:58,470
Speaker 0: We've banned only one person ever after approving their application.

397
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:08,950
Speaker 0: So if you have Hotmail, you're not going to receive the email that tells you your application was approved, because Hotmail blocks it like spam.

398
00:31:09,573 --> 00:31:15,444
Speaker 0: So if you have Hotmail, still sign up for the forum, and just wait maybe a day at most.

399
00:31:16,891 --> 00:31:22,810
Speaker 0: I usually approve these things within hours, if not minutes, because I get a little email when someone applies.

400
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:31,989
Speaker 0: Just come back to the forum and sign in with your name and password, and it will probably work, because I hardly ever reject anyone, unless they're obviously a spammer or a bot.

401
00:31:33,073 --> 00:31:40,450
Speaker 0: We haven't had too many spammers or bots, although it does seem like there's a lot of lurkers, people just going around the forums reading and posting very rarely.

402
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:52,629
Speaker 0: You can tell, looking at the Identify Yourself thread, there's a lot of people who went in there and talked all about themselves, or gave enough of a bio, and then don't actually participate in too many of the threads.

403
00:31:54,192 --> 00:31:58,029
Speaker 0: That's fine, you can do whatever you want, but the more people talk, the merrier.

404
00:31:58,911 --> 00:32:11,146
Speaker 0: If there's nothing in the forum that you're really interested in talking about, well, you're listening to Geek Nights, you must have something to say about the things we're saying, so even if someone's already stated your opinion, at least say, "Hey, me too,".

405
00:32:11,571 --> 00:32:17,210
Speaker 0: or if there's something you want to talk about that isn't in there, post and don't be afraid to start a new discussion in the forum.

406
00:32:17,933 --> 00:32:18,970
Speaker 0: The more activity, the better.

407
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:22,268
Speaker 0: And of course, if you haven't joined the forum, go join it.

408
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:26,104
Speaker 0: Um, let's see, forum Frapper.

409
00:32:26,466 --> 00:32:27,029
Speaker 0: Ah, Frapper.

410
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:31,770
Speaker 0: Seems like every podcast in just about every blog in the world now has a Frapper map.

411
00:32:32,212 --> 00:32:32,644
Speaker 0: We do too!

412
00:32:33,476 --> 00:32:41,570
Speaker 0: It's kind of fun to look at, actually, because it's this map of the world with little pushpins wherever there's a listener of Geek Nights, which is way cool.

413
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:53,570
Speaker 0: Um, you can go there, and not only can you post yourself, you can post a location of a geek house, a location of a geek convention, or any other sort of geek place.

414
00:32:54,750 --> 00:33:04,770
Speaker 0: So, go to our Frapper map, and join the list, and everyone will be able to see where all the cool Geek Nights listeners and whatnot are in the world.

415
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,088
Speaker 0: It's a whole lot of fun.

416
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,100
Speaker 0: It doesn't really cost anything.

417
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:15,306
Speaker 0: It's just you go to this map online, and you put a little pin on it saying, "Hey, I'm a Geek Nights listener, and this is where I am.

418
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:15,788
Speaker 0: How you

419
00:33:15,808 --> 00:33:16,070
Speaker 0: doing?".

420
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:22,830
Speaker 0: Definitely fun, and the more pushpins on there, the more fun it is, especially when those pushpins are in foreign countries.

421
00:33:24,497 --> 00:33:25,028
Speaker 0: Uh, let's see.

422
00:33:25,773 --> 00:33:27,029
Speaker 0: Ah, the logo contest.

423
00:33:27,734 --> 00:33:37,469
Speaker 0: I don't know how many people know about this or don't know about this, but we've been having a logo contest that's been ongoing, and we just keep forgetting to mention it, which you really should mention in every episode.

424
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:41,950
Speaker 0: Geek Nights does not have a logo, nor does the Front Row Crew.

425
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:50,970
Speaker 0: We need a logo so that we can put it in our podcasts and our feeds so it appears in iTunes, and to put it on the top of our web page, and to put it on merchandise.

426
00:33:52,793 --> 00:33:58,930
Speaker 0: If you make a logo, it should be a square, and it should look good at the top of frontrowcrew.com.

427
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:02,830
Speaker 0: So if you go to frontrowcrew.com, you'll see the top of the page is this blue color.

428
00:34:03,351 --> 00:34:05,570
Speaker 0: It's sort of this gradient that goes from dark to light blue.

429
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:09,050
Speaker 0: Your logo should look good if we put it up there.

430
00:34:09,311 --> 00:34:12,830
Speaker 0: It should also be a square so that it works well in iTunes and all that.

431
00:34:14,351 --> 00:34:19,570
Speaker 0: If your logo is good, we will give you $50, and you will give us the logo.

432
00:34:20,371 --> 00:34:27,710
Speaker 0: You won't own the logo, sadly, but you will receive mad props, $50, and mad credit.

433
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:32,342
Speaker 0: So every single episode of Geek Nights at the end, we will say, "Thanks to so-and-so for the

434
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:32,686
Speaker 0: logo.".

435
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:41,290
Speaker 0: And on all the t-shirts and all the websites where we will sell t-shirts, who knows, we can't give you any more information about that, and it won't be just t-shirts either.

436
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:48,984
Speaker 0: There will be things that say, "Thanks to so-and-so, whoever you are, for creating the awesome logo," or, "Logo by

437
00:34:49,085 --> 00:34:49,627
Speaker 0: so-and-so.".

438
00:34:50,471 --> 00:34:55,050
Speaker 0: And even if you don't care about getting recognition, that's a great thing for a resume.

439
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:56,458
Speaker 0: Like, "I created an awesome

440
00:34:56,498 --> 00:34:56,920
Speaker 0: logo.".

441
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,950
Speaker 0: So we're probably going to -- time is running out on this.

442
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:03,970
Speaker 0: We've really taken too damn long finding a logo.

443
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:11,810
Speaker 0: So you've got -- I'm going to give you, at most, one more month to submit logos.

444
00:35:12,272 --> 00:35:14,490
Speaker 0: Maybe not even that long, maybe just a couple weeks.

445
00:35:14,973 --> 00:35:23,723
Speaker 0: And then we're going to pick whatever we like the best, probably ask the artist to modify it in some way, you know, because so far nothing has been 100% perfect.

446
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:31,570
Speaker 0: So we'll probably take something that's 90% perfect, ask the artist to modify 10% of it, and then go with that.

447
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:33,289
Speaker 0: So time is running out.

448
00:35:33,771 --> 00:35:36,690
Speaker 0: If you want to make us a logo, hurry yourself up.

449
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:37,583
Speaker 0: You're running out of time.

450
00:35:39,734 --> 00:35:41,090
Speaker 0: Uh, e-mail.

451
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:45,790
Speaker 0: Yes, I just did a whole show where I read e-mails.

452
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:58,349
Speaker 0: If you want to send us an e-mail, which we may or may not read on a show, but we probably will reply to it by e-mail, send your e-mails to geekknights@frontrowcrew.com.

453
00:35:59,512 --> 00:36:02,230
Speaker 0: I think you can figure out how to spell that based on the other things I've said.

454
00:36:03,753 --> 00:36:07,270
Speaker 0: Okay, I think I've tortured you all long enough.

455
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:08,969
Speaker 0: This show's over.

456
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:19,321
Speaker 0: On Monday we will resume normal, mildly edited podcasting, as opposed to this completely unedited crap.

457
00:36:19,422 --> 00:36:21,429
Speaker 0: audio quality nothing podcasting.

458
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:22,251
Speaker 0: Right.

459
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:23,097
Speaker 0: Shutting up.

460
00:36:24,043 --> 00:36:24,345
Speaker 0: Monday.

461
00:36:24,889 --> 00:36:25,050
Speaker 0: Bye.
