1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,148
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, November 29th.

2
00:00:11,329 --> 00:00:14,380
Speaker 1: I'm rim and I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

3
00:00:15,202 --> 00:00:20,480
Speaker 1: Tonight due to popular demand we go back to comics for a bit and review Mouse Guard.

4
00:00:22,181 --> 00:00:23,197
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:24,542 --> 00:00:35,760
Speaker 1: So over the weekend since Emily can't really use it in her dorm She decided to give me her old Yamaha keyboard, which is actually quite a bit better than the keyboard I had when I was a kid.

6
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,891
Speaker 0: It's a pretty beefy box when I was a kid.

7
00:00:37,931 --> 00:00:39,560
Speaker 0: I had this tiny tiny keyboard.

8
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:40,708
Speaker 1: I had the same one.

9
00:00:40,788 --> 00:00:42,539
Speaker 1: probably it was like the CT six.

10
00:00:42,881 --> 00:00:46,720
Speaker 1: I forget you want it was this tiny little thing and out of tiny microphone in the top, right?

11
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:47,321
Speaker 0: I didn't.

12
00:00:47,361 --> 00:00:49,491
Speaker 0: mine didn't have a tiny microphone really know?

13
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,556
Speaker 1: mine had a microphone.

14
00:00:50,576 --> 00:00:55,357
Speaker 1: you could record One second of audio and then it would play it back through keys.

15
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:02,998
Speaker 0: Oh, wow No mine It was like a had very small keys for like little hands and it had two sets of eight buttons and the like.

16
00:01:03,118 --> 00:01:08,815
Speaker 0: first eight Were different instruments you could play and the second eight buttons were different.

17
00:01:08,895 --> 00:01:10,300
Speaker 0: like backbeats you could run

18
00:01:10,702 --> 00:01:10,822
Speaker 1: Oh

19
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:22,999
Speaker 0: and you could change the tempo of the backbeats and you could change Like the pitch of the instruments a little bit see this thing and then you could record like a small demo loop and then play That back and then play over it.

20
00:01:23,246 --> 00:01:28,240
Speaker 1: Yeah I had a little tiny one and then I had a pretty good one and then eventually my parents bought me that digital piano.

21
00:01:28,741 --> 00:01:35,840
Speaker 1: But this keyboard sitting behind me now and I kind of integrated it into my desk is a full-on MIDI authoring keyboard.

22
00:01:36,042 --> 00:01:36,870
Speaker 1: That's pretty cool.

23
00:01:36,891 --> 00:01:45,769
Speaker 0: Yeah All right That's not necessary.

24
00:01:46,751 --> 00:01:55,056
Speaker 1: I'm really pleased with this and it is inspired me along with a couple of people in the forums who asked why I didn't just Arrange some music for geek nights.

25
00:01:55,718 --> 00:02:08,681
Speaker 1: I responded in the forum that the answer was purely laziness and Hopefully over this Christmas break when I have some free time I'm gonna actually sit down and try to arrange something again, man If you think that's cool, you should check out like a modern keyboard.

26
00:02:09,023 --> 00:02:10,690
Speaker 0: I'm well aware this thing is mad.

27
00:02:11,572 --> 00:02:14,130
Speaker 1: I'm well aware of keyboard technology.

28
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:23,630
Speaker 1: in fact back in high school even my friend can had a Very very nice keyboard and he was doing stuff with MIDI before I even knew what MIDI was.

29
00:02:24,253 --> 00:02:26,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean this thing can't even make the Eurobeat noise.

30
00:02:26,871 --> 00:02:28,336
Speaker 1: So well, it can.

31
00:02:28,436 --> 00:02:32,590
Speaker 1: I can make any noise if I plug it into a MIDI synthesizer as opposed to using the built-in synth?

32
00:02:32,771 --> 00:02:34,779
Speaker 0: Yeah, but doesn't have a Eurobeat built in.

33
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:35,824
Speaker 0: So what good is it?

34
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:38,894
Speaker 0: It's not good at all Right.

35
00:02:38,955 --> 00:02:41,883
Speaker 1: So what do you got in the news since I got nothing else to say about this.

36
00:02:42,565 --> 00:02:49,570
Speaker 0: So a while ago I think I might have done a story about like the top 10 most important people in manga in America.

37
00:02:50,194 --> 00:02:52,450
Speaker 0: The top guy is a guy named Kurt Hassler.

38
00:02:52,972 --> 00:03:07,497
Speaker 0: Kurt Hassler his job until recently and that's the news is that it's no longer his job was to purchase Manga and graphic novels and you know comics for borders and Walden books because the same company that you know Cuz all the retailer really is is a middleman.

39
00:03:07,538 --> 00:03:10,590
Speaker 0: they buy stuff from one person and they sell it to someone else.

40
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:15,097
Speaker 0: So when you're a book retailer, you buy stuff from publishers and sell it to people.

41
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:26,119
Speaker 0: So his job was to buy The Jillian's of copies of manga and graphic novels and then sell them to you and me and he Could he had to figure out how many to buy?

42
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,494
Speaker 0: Which ones to buy who to buy them from which stores to send them to all kinds of stuff.

43
00:03:31,935 --> 00:03:40,055
Speaker 0: He was a real important guy Apparently on November 6 which is already like 20 days ago, but I totally missed the news 23 days ago.

44
00:03:40,075 --> 00:03:44,139
Speaker 0: He Decided doesn't want to do that anymore.

45
00:03:44,883 --> 00:03:50,649
Speaker 0: Now he's actually gonna go into the business of selling Some manga and some comics.

46
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:51,534
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

47
00:03:51,554 --> 00:03:54,600
Speaker 0: Yep, apparently What's the name of this company?

48
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:57,409
Speaker 0: Some publisher that I've never heard.

49
00:03:57,449 --> 00:03:59,399
Speaker 1: you totally deserve the thought bird right there.

50
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:01,084
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna.

51
00:04:01,686 --> 00:04:05,382
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna rip off anime world order a pair of hash it I don't know.

52
00:04:05,423 --> 00:04:08,460
Speaker 0: Do you know the publisher named hatchet never heard of him?

53
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:16,569
Speaker 0: But honestly until I'm not even sure if I'm pronouncing your rights h a c h e t t e Hatchet hatchet, maybe it's hatchet.

54
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:19,160
Speaker 1: I've never really paid attention to who published the things I like.

55
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:27,458
Speaker 0: Yeah me either really anyway hatchet is a publisher and they're making a new imprint named yen press.

56
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,722
Speaker 1: Okay,

57
00:04:28,943 --> 00:04:45,520
Speaker 0: and yen press is gonna be a new publisher of manga in America and it's going to be Kurt hassler is gonna be the man and he's gonna you know be deciding what manga they're gonna get and bring over here And he's gonna be trying to sell it to people who did his former job.

58
00:04:45,640 --> 00:05:00,158
Speaker 0: So he's probably gonna do a good job of it because if it was your job to buy stuff And then suddenly you become the guy trying to sell stuff to your former position You know what to tell yourself to convince you to buy it.

59
00:05:01,421 --> 00:05:07,240
Speaker 0: Tell the person who has your old job to convince them to buy it unless they're just a different person.

60
00:05:07,664 --> 00:05:08,250
Speaker 0: It could be.

61
00:05:08,311 --> 00:05:19,165
Speaker 1: but you know Considering that hopefully they make their decisions based on the same logic and such I mean suppose for a second that the guy who takes over happens to be say David Riley from fast karate for the.

62
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:24,780
Speaker 1: oh god, they'll order nothing but fist of the North Star and more fist of the North Star.

63
00:05:24,961 --> 00:05:26,860
Speaker 0: Well, I think Kurt hassler is a smart guy.

64
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:33,400
Speaker 0: So he if he knew Dave Riley and Dave Riley got his old job somehow, there would be much fist of the North Star license.

65
00:05:35,643 --> 00:05:39,576
Speaker 0: No, but yeah expect to see a lot of yen press books in borders in.

66
00:05:41,481 --> 00:05:43,186
Speaker 0: You know some months I guess I don't know.

67
00:05:43,547 --> 00:05:47,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, honestly, I've never been that impressed with borders section of a of manga.

68
00:05:48,061 --> 00:05:49,266
Speaker 0: They do not carry Phoenix.

69
00:05:49,326 --> 00:05:50,230
Speaker 0: Therefore they suck.

70
00:05:50,692 --> 00:05:52,680
Speaker 0: Well, basically they carry everything.

71
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,580
Speaker 0: They carry all the Tokyo pops and all the mainstream stuff.

72
00:05:55,961 --> 00:06:01,300
Speaker 0: They don't carry the Viz signature series, which is pretty much the only thing you need to carry because that's all the good stuff.

73
00:06:01,682 --> 00:06:07,398
Speaker 1: well, I used to get all my manga from The book the bookstores in the mall like Walden books.

74
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:13,940
Speaker 1: Yep And before that I used to get him from media play off and on but now honestly I get them all from the internet.

75
00:06:14,201 --> 00:06:15,146
Speaker 0: Yeah, Amazon.

76
00:06:15,247 --> 00:06:22,639
Speaker 1: In fact when I think about it, I Rarely buy anything other than food from any source other than the internet.

77
00:06:23,021 --> 00:06:25,532
Speaker 0: I buy household goods from not the internet.

78
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,360
Speaker 1: Well, yeah household household goods and food.

79
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:31,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I try to buy household goods on the internet, but you can never be sure.

80
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,429
Speaker 0: I mean I bought like some bedsheets and towels and stuff like.

81
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:36,512
Speaker 0: those towels are great.

82
00:06:36,873 --> 00:06:41,807
Speaker 0: Yeah, but man, I can't buy bowls or Spatulas on the internet just doesn't work.

83
00:06:41,908 --> 00:06:44,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we buy them at the grocery store so we don't have to go shopping.

84
00:06:45,043 --> 00:06:45,365
Speaker 0: It's true.

85
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:47,940
Speaker 1: I mean when was the last time we went to a mall?

86
00:06:48,122 --> 00:06:50,020
Speaker 0: I don't buy clothing and shoes on the internet either.

87
00:06:50,288 --> 00:06:56,040
Speaker 1: Oh, no But I try to buy them if I can down in New York City or sporting goods or outdoors actually cheaper.

88
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:59,073
Speaker 1: But other than that what outdoor goods would you need?

89
00:06:59,555 --> 00:07:00,640
Speaker 1: What do you do outdoors?

90
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:02,163
Speaker 0: Hardware, I don't.

91
00:07:02,223 --> 00:07:02,926
Speaker 0: I don't buy hardware.

92
00:07:03,046 --> 00:07:04,391
Speaker 0: Like if I go to Home Depot instead.

93
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:04,793
Speaker 0: Yeah.

94
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what sporting goods do you need?

95
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:12,960
Speaker 1: What do you do other than other than walk between your car and the house in the cold balls?

96
00:07:14,382 --> 00:07:15,671
Speaker 0: Yeah balls to play with.

97
00:07:16,214 --> 00:07:16,999
Speaker 1: I'm well aware of that.

98
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,451
Speaker 1: So this isn't really an anime news.

99
00:07:20,471 --> 00:07:22,280
Speaker 1: In fact, it's not at all an anime news.

100
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:23,459
Speaker 1: It's some video game news.

101
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:30,360
Speaker 1: But there's really no anime news I care about and I'm really not gonna talk about the anime news that anime world order talks about.

102
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:36,542
Speaker 1: Because if you really care about that stuff you can listen to them or you can read anime news network calm and get all The anime news.

103
00:07:36,763 --> 00:07:37,004
Speaker 0: Yeah.

104
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:44,889
Speaker 0: Yeah for anyone out there who doesn't you know who actually thinks that our show is about reporting news Our show is not the place to get the news.

105
00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:47,720
Speaker 0: No, our show is the place where you comment on the news.

106
00:07:48,142 --> 00:07:49,290
Speaker 1: We're also kind of a filter.

107
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:56,940
Speaker 1: if you don't want to read the news You'll figure out what's important to us from listening except for the fact that we don't talk about politics or military.

108
00:07:57,081 --> 00:08:01,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, you get like the like the top one or two stories and none of the you know.

109
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,080
Speaker 0: What you really need to know is the top five or ten stories.

110
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,939
Speaker 0: But if you read anime news network calm anime news service calm and anime on DVD?

111
00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:11,628
Speaker 0: calm That's pretty much all the news.

112
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,357
Speaker 0: You don't need any other anime news.

113
00:08:13,377 --> 00:08:13,699
Speaker 0: That's it.

114
00:08:14,241 --> 00:08:19,500
Speaker 0: Everything else is who know cares unless you can read Japanese then there are sites that you can look at get better news.

115
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:35,871
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah back in the when the SNES started fading and the Nintendo 64 was coming into prominence That is when I abandoned console gaming to completely embrace PC gaming We also now that lasted me up until the DS came out.

116
00:08:36,352 --> 00:08:38,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was still doing some GBA action.

117
00:08:38,861 --> 00:08:42,280
Speaker 0: But and I got a GameCube and I did a lot of GameCube stuff.

118
00:08:42,662 --> 00:08:50,800
Speaker 0: But even when I had the GameCube, you know, it only provided Intermittent gaming entertainment because it would be a game and I would go to the GameCube and play the game.

119
00:08:51,122 --> 00:08:53,840
Speaker 0: Then I go back to the PC during the drought until the next game.

120
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,699
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the DS and the Wii have pretty much been my primary consoles now.

121
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,485
Speaker 1: Yeah, we is really awesome.

122
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:01,854
Speaker 1: But we've talked about that enough now.

123
00:09:02,316 --> 00:09:03,440
Speaker 1: There is one game.

124
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:12,709
Speaker 1: Well, really two games that I ever liked on the Nintendo 64 not counting, you know, Zelda's or anything like that But games that were kind of party hasn't played.

125
00:09:12,729 --> 00:09:13,050
Speaker 0: Zelda 64.

126
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,696
Speaker 1: I have played it.

127
00:09:14,796 --> 00:09:15,539
Speaker 1: I have not beaten it.

128
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,071
Speaker 1: Uh, you haven't played it and I haven't played Majora's Mask.

129
00:09:19,112 --> 00:09:19,292
Speaker 0: Good.

130
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:21,480
Speaker 1: I watched you play the first five minutes of it.

131
00:09:21,801 --> 00:09:22,504
Speaker 0: I can't play that game.

132
00:09:22,765 --> 00:09:24,150
Speaker 1: I understand the plot of the game.

133
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,756
Speaker 1: I don't I read a spoiler.

134
00:09:25,776 --> 00:09:26,840
Speaker 0: I barely understand it.

135
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,780
Speaker 0: All I know is three days and then you shit yourself.

136
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:38,460
Speaker 1: Now a lot of people seem to like this this fancy new game called Halo and They talk about how it's this great FPS and I have a whole Scott's making farting noises.

137
00:09:38,601 --> 00:09:41,039
Speaker 1: I have this whole rant I could do and Scott agrees with me.

138
00:09:41,422 --> 00:09:57,766
Speaker 1: I don't know which one of us came up with the first where for the most part It seems to me that people who like Halo as on FPS and not just as a console FPS But they say it's a good FPS and they like it and they find it anything more than just an average FPS Are people who never played.

139
00:09:58,127 --> 00:10:02,019
Speaker 1: all the FPS is that came out years and years and years and years and years before.

140
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:06,679
Speaker 0: hey Laura least, you know, maybe they played them, but they didn't play them like.

141
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,678
Speaker 0: yeah I was one of those guys who played counter-strike.

142
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:10,883
Speaker 1: see I don't know.

143
00:10:10,963 --> 00:10:16,179
Speaker 1: most of the people who play Halo and really like it have never really played FPS is on the PC?

144
00:10:16,662 --> 00:10:17,346
Speaker 0: Nope, not really.

145
00:10:17,387 --> 00:10:21,576
Speaker 1: No, but they also Regardless of that argument just put that away.

146
00:10:22,401 --> 00:10:27,593
Speaker 1: Anyone who thinks Halo is a great multiplayer FPS for the console has never played.

147
00:10:27,673 --> 00:10:32,626
Speaker 1: probably the best console FPS ever made GoldenEye for the Nintendo 64.

148
00:10:32,626 --> 00:10:38,886
Speaker 0: I mean if you really look at it, Halo is just updated golden eye Yeah, and it doesn't really update much.

149
00:10:38,966 --> 00:10:40,872
Speaker 0: I mean golden eye was the graphics.

150
00:10:41,293 --> 00:10:41,554
Speaker 1: Yeah.

151
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,560
Speaker 1: Yeah golden eye was not the best game.

152
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,227
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna say it was some great game.

153
00:10:45,267 --> 00:10:48,340
Speaker 0: But for what it was in its day, it was fantastic.

154
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,388
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I hated console gaming.

155
00:10:50,428 --> 00:10:53,560
Speaker 1: I just I didn't never thought that Nintendo 64 was gonna be worth it.

156
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,178
Speaker 1: I didn't really like any of the games on it.

157
00:10:55,563 --> 00:11:05,980
Speaker 1: But I remember at band camp Every night in this rickety-ass cabin in the middle of the woods with this power cable going down the mountain We were playing golden eye until the Sun came up.

158
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:17,520
Speaker 0: Nothing was better than a little midget running around on a boat and there's a frickin Baron Samity with a top hat and he's got two RCP 90s and someone fires the rocket launcher and he goes flying into.

159
00:11:19,003 --> 00:11:20,672
Speaker 1: All about the moonraker laser.

160
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:22,120
Speaker 0: moonraker laser for the win.

161
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:29,440
Speaker 1: My general strategy in that game was to go to any open area strafe back and forth randomly while firing my moonraker.

162
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:32,473
Speaker 0: Yeah There are basically three weapons in the game that I cared about.

163
00:11:32,513 --> 00:11:39,500
Speaker 0: that was the moonraker laser The rocket launcher, of course and the RCP 90 which got damn dual RCP 90.

164
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,650
Speaker 0: You know RCP 90 just so many bullets.

165
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,940
Speaker 0: you could lag the game if you knew what to do now.

166
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,036
Speaker 1: Anyway, we're not gonna review the game even though it's a fantastic game.

167
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,224
Speaker 1: No, what I put the news here.

168
00:11:49,725 --> 00:11:52,614
Speaker 1: Is that Reggie from Nintendo Reggie?

169
00:11:52,835 --> 00:11:54,299
Speaker 0: Can you pronounce his last name for me?

170
00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:00,757
Speaker 1: I think it's fees on me, whatever The point is they didn't have it in front of me So I wasn't gonna go over all the details of the news.

171
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:06,034
Speaker 1: The Nintendo does not have the rights to use this old bond game.

172
00:12:06,054 --> 00:12:08,060
Speaker 1: They can't just release it on a new system or any.

173
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,606
Speaker 0: yeah, because what happened was is rare.

174
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:27,419
Speaker 0: the company that developed games like Donkey Kong Country and GoldenEye was purchased by Microsoft done And now they make Microsoft games for the Xbox and The rights to make James Bond games went to EA and then it's currently held by Activision.

175
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,180
Speaker 1: now This game has is no threat to bond games that are going to be coming out.

176
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:52,580
Speaker 1: No one's going to buy this and then not buy the new bond game based on the freaking awesome bond movie I saw over the weekend, but Nintendo has realized that there has been for the last many years a Massive fan outcry for any way of Nintendo bringing this game back.

177
00:12:53,001 --> 00:12:58,577
Speaker 0: Because really the only way to play Goldeneye is to have a Nintendo 64 or to have a Nintendo 64 emulator.

178
00:13:00,022 --> 00:13:02,372
Speaker 1: Everyone wanted it on the GameCube and Nintendo said they couldn't.

179
00:13:02,693 --> 00:13:14,680
Speaker 0: and now with a virtual console Everyone really wants it on the virtual console I mean rare made perfect dark for the n64 which was sort of the same engine without the James Bond license and it was good.

180
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,785
Speaker 0: But it it wasn't the same as Goldeneye.

181
00:13:16,885 --> 00:13:21,416
Speaker 0: I mean it was technically superior, but it wasn't the same.

182
00:13:21,637 --> 00:13:22,860
Speaker 0: fun multiplayer action.

183
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:28,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you know, there are games like TimeSplitters 2 for the GameCube that provides similar action.

184
00:13:28,581 --> 00:13:33,700
Speaker 0: There's Halo which provides similar action, but then there was perfect dark zero, which just sucked.

185
00:13:33,942 --> 00:13:35,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, but we'll skip all that because it's not video game day.

186
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:50,480
Speaker 1: the news is simply that Nintendo pays attention to what its fans want and Reggie said that Nintendo is exploring all the options and basically doing everything it can To get this game on the virtual console so we can play it on the Wii.

187
00:13:51,342 --> 00:14:06,260
Speaker 1: Now that even if they fail even if Microsoft, you know, and all the people involved won't budge and they can't get it Nintendo cannot lose by saying this because if they succeed They will make a lot of money on people buying this game on the virtual console.

188
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:09,671
Speaker 0: Ten bucks ten bucks ten bucks for Goldeneye.

189
00:14:10,052 --> 00:14:14,750
Speaker 1: if there were twelve bucks I'd consider it I wouldn't but I don't know the twelve but we could split it.

190
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,939
Speaker 1: Yeah, then it's only six bucks.

191
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:17,939
Speaker 0: shit All right.

192
00:14:18,087 --> 00:14:30,696
Speaker 1: Yeah but even if they fail and nothing comes of this they made a lot of people happy just by saying that they're trying and They'll even end up making the people who won't let them get the game look like the bad guys.

193
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:31,640
Speaker 1: It's win-win.

194
00:14:32,262 --> 00:14:38,969
Speaker 0: Also, you know in addition to the awesome multiplayer, which is the primary reason to get Goldeneye It gives the game with a really good single player.

195
00:14:38,989 --> 00:14:39,953
Speaker 1: There was a single player.

196
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:41,237
Speaker 1: I never even touched it.

197
00:14:41,257 --> 00:14:42,140
Speaker 0: You gotta play it man.

198
00:14:42,425 --> 00:14:43,279
Speaker 0: It's actually good stuff.

199
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,500
Speaker 1: I only the only games I ever played on a Nintendo 64 were Goldeneye multiplayer and Mario tennis.

200
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,458
Speaker 0: You got it.

201
00:14:50,721 --> 00:14:55,260
Speaker 0: If you played the Goldeneye single-player, you'll see there's actually really interesting maps and missions going on.

202
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,815
Speaker 1: No, once I played Smash Brothers, I thought it was the stupidest thing ever.

203
00:14:59,318 --> 00:15:03,647
Speaker 1: I'm sorry You suck Smash Brothers for the GameCube.

204
00:15:03,687 --> 00:15:06,700
Speaker 1: However, it was probably the best game to come out with that console.

205
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,666
Speaker 0: No, I don't know about that.

206
00:15:08,706 --> 00:15:10,876
Speaker 1: Well to come out with as in in the launch window.

207
00:15:11,097 --> 00:15:11,419
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

208
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:15,652
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, I mean I counted as a launch game because Luigi's Mansion wasn't a game.

209
00:15:15,813 --> 00:15:16,234
Speaker 0: I wasn't.

210
00:15:16,555 --> 00:15:18,040
Speaker 1: it was just general beauregard.

211
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:27,146
Speaker 1: Beauregard Things of the day.

212
00:15:27,568 --> 00:15:30,880
Speaker 1: now, you're all familiar with anime music videos.

213
00:15:31,862 --> 00:15:35,320
Speaker 1: You might be familiar with our opinions on the current state of anime music videos.

214
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:36,044
Speaker 0: I don't know.

215
00:15:36,064 --> 00:15:38,760
Speaker 0: Have we really gone into complete detail on them on the show?

216
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:40,826
Speaker 1: I think we've tangentially got to.

217
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:42,894
Speaker 1: we'll do a show on anime music videos.

218
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,280
Speaker 0: That's a good idea right there.

219
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:59,419
Speaker 1: In fact, I think when we do that show We'll list and link to all the AMVs out there from back in the day that we think are good and then what I'd like to do probably is we'll get all of our listeners to Try to prove us wrong and find videos that are recent that are just as good.

220
00:16:00,263 --> 00:16:06,819
Speaker 1: The only reason I don't see him is that due to the way the anime music into you Anime music video scene is set up.

221
00:16:07,262 --> 00:16:10,780
Speaker 1: It's really hard for good music videos to become widely disseminated.

222
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,787
Speaker 0: It really needs to be.

223
00:16:11,988 --> 00:16:16,279
Speaker 0: maybe there is one and I just haven't found it But there really needs to be a blog of some guy who?

224
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,440
Speaker 0: Checks all the new music videos and then puts the good ones up on it in a blog somewhere.

225
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:28,436
Speaker 1: Yeah, we need like the OC remixes equivalent of AMVs because currently anime music videos org is Ninety-nine percent crap.

226
00:16:28,617 --> 00:16:28,980
Speaker 0: Yeah.

227
00:16:29,842 --> 00:16:37,720
Speaker 1: But anyway, if you think that anime music videos are lame And we know a lot of people who do even though I think that they can be really cool and they have their use

228
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:45,597
Speaker 0: They have potential the thing is most of them are lame as it with anything else, you know, most movies are lame But movies are the potential to be.

229
00:16:45,618 --> 00:16:53,243
Speaker 1: yeah I defy anyone to tell me that the anime music video to antenna set to that rock cover of hit me baby one more time Is lame.

230
00:16:53,966 --> 00:16:54,911
Speaker 0: it's totally not lame.

231
00:16:55,092 --> 00:16:56,620
Speaker 1: It's double on lame.

232
00:16:57,202 --> 00:17:03,020
Speaker 1: But haven't you ever wondered why anime has had this music video thing?

233
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,119
Speaker 1: That's gotten so huge to the point that it's kind of a fixture at almost every anime con.

234
00:17:07,742 --> 00:17:11,780
Speaker 1: Yet most other fandoms until recently didn't have anything similar.

235
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:16,259
Speaker 1: I mean now with this machinima and all that a lot of video games are starting to have the same thing.

236
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:21,637
Speaker 1: But I had never really seen anyone do this to a mainstream movie before.

237
00:17:21,656 --> 00:17:23,904
Speaker 1: Uh-oh Until now.

238
00:17:24,325 --> 00:17:28,717
Speaker 1: Oh my thing of the day is a I want to say anime music video, but it's not.

239
00:17:29,158 --> 00:17:36,079
Speaker 1: it's a movie music video to Lord of the Rings set to the theme from Newsies Oh God.

240
00:17:36,099 --> 00:17:40,030
Speaker 1: and There's a worse one out there, but I don't want to link to it.

241
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:41,696
Speaker 1: Probably the worst music video.

242
00:17:41,716 --> 00:17:42,960
Speaker 0: This one is painful enough.

243
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,519
Speaker 0: How could it possibly be more painful?

244
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:49,600
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is this is about as bad as the average bad anime music video.

245
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:57,430
Speaker 1: So it's really not more painful than that except for the fact that if you haven't seen something like this That isn't too anime.

246
00:17:57,852 --> 00:17:59,040
Speaker 1: It might seem worse.

247
00:17:59,472 --> 00:18:08,712
Speaker 1: Yeah I guess my advice to you is that if you watch this and you cringe and then you watch a terrible anime music video and Don't cringe you've just become sensitized.

248
00:18:09,335 --> 00:18:11,623
Speaker 1: Oh, that doesn't make the enemy Desensitized.

249
00:18:11,764 --> 00:18:12,850
Speaker 0: Yeah desensitized.

250
00:18:13,132 --> 00:18:14,279
Speaker 1: That doesn't make it any better.

251
00:18:15,343 --> 00:18:31,800
Speaker 1: I mean the worst one I ever saw which if you want to find it You're on your own was done to the Horatio horn-blower television series and it was sent to the song candle on the water and it totally makes gay illusions about Kennedy and Horatio.

252
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:41,688
Speaker 0: It's literally just this song playing and like Horatio had a particular attachment to that video He just kept watching it and watching it.

253
00:18:42,229 --> 00:18:43,152
Speaker 0: Yeah.

254
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:43,514
Speaker 0: Yeah.

255
00:18:43,975 --> 00:18:49,477
Speaker 1: Well if you really want to find the video I'm sure you can find it on the Horatio horn-blower fanfiction archives.

256
00:18:49,697 --> 00:18:54,059
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah There are more fanfics there than they're fucking well should be.

257
00:18:55,328 --> 00:18:55,877
Speaker 0: So there's one.

258
00:18:57,163 --> 00:18:59,740
Speaker 1: I'm okay with her being one fanfic to anything.

259
00:19:00,141 --> 00:19:04,595
Speaker 1: There's nothing wrong with that, but the sheer number of fanfics to Horatio hornblower.

260
00:19:04,615 --> 00:19:09,770
Speaker 0: Good God okay, so My thing of the day is really simple.

261
00:19:10,252 --> 00:19:10,894
Speaker 0: There's Pocky.

262
00:19:11,155 --> 00:19:12,260
Speaker 0: We all know about Pocky.

263
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:20,428
Speaker 0: Yeah Pocky's that flavored sugar on a bready stick snack that they overstayed sell it For five bucks.

264
00:19:20,448 --> 00:19:23,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, they sell it at anime conventions for ludicrously high prices.

265
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:32,052
Speaker 0: But anyone who's smart enough to go to the Asian market or as a good grocery store like Wegmans Can get it at normal prices of a dollar for a whole lot of it.

266
00:19:32,554 --> 00:19:33,356
Speaker 0: and it's tasty.

267
00:19:33,396 --> 00:19:34,660
Speaker 0: and you know, it's a good snack.

268
00:19:35,402 --> 00:19:40,540
Speaker 0: It's fun and there's many different flavors and everyone knows a Gundam is you know robots?

269
00:19:41,022 --> 00:19:44,560
Speaker 0: Robot models robot anime manga video games, etc.

270
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:49,635
Speaker 1: Now what if you were somehow able to combine these two forces of good and righteousness.

271
00:19:49,935 --> 00:19:51,500
Speaker 0: you eat a sugary robot?

272
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:52,541
Speaker 1: I don't know.

273
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:55,190
Speaker 0: Are you pilot a sugary breadstick?

274
00:19:55,651 --> 00:19:58,280
Speaker 1: or perhaps you just buy Gundam branded Pocky?

275
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:06,230
Speaker 0: Yes, there is Gundam Pocky and basically they're trying to get More people in our demographic to eat the Pocky.

276
00:20:06,631 --> 00:20:07,694
Speaker 1: I eat Pocky all the time.

277
00:20:07,734 --> 00:20:09,378
Speaker 0: I know but I'm talking about in Japan.

278
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:11,064
Speaker 0: Yeah This is not.

279
00:20:11,245 --> 00:20:12,551
Speaker 0: you know, you know what's gonna happen.

280
00:20:12,772 --> 00:20:14,360
Speaker 1: They're gonna be people selling that pot.

281
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,692
Speaker 0: That's what I'm getting to.

282
00:20:15,753 --> 00:20:16,500
Speaker 0: I'm getting to that.

283
00:20:16,686 --> 00:20:27,073
Speaker 0: all right but they're taking the men's Pocky the default Pocky and this other flavor of Pocky and they're Including in the box of Pocky a pretty simple Gundam model.

284
00:20:27,294 --> 00:20:27,855
Speaker 0: Oh really.

285
00:20:27,956 --> 00:20:30,665
Speaker 0: and the simple Gundam model They show in the picture here.

286
00:20:30,685 --> 00:20:40,327
Speaker 0: The model is holding a Pocky stick as if it's a sword And there's three different models For the different flavors.

287
00:20:40,387 --> 00:20:42,940
Speaker 1: I think you have to get them all to put on your shelf of Gundams.

288
00:20:43,161 --> 00:20:49,131
Speaker 0: No, I don't know but it's quite obvious that if you live in Japan Why not buy this for fun?

289
00:20:49,734 --> 00:20:50,700
Speaker 0: if you live in the u.s.

290
00:20:51,262 --> 00:21:01,759
Speaker 0: Expect people who run anime stores and and are dealers of anime goods You know to get this from Japan for like a dollar and to sell it to you for ten dollars.

291
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,407
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't buy this at an anime con.

292
00:21:05,427 --> 00:21:09,520
Speaker 0: I'm just warning you right now don't pay more than five bucks for one of these things.

293
00:21:09,721 --> 00:21:13,113
Speaker 0: It's really not worth it because you're gonna eat all the Pocky.

294
00:21:13,133 --> 00:21:15,020
Speaker 0: You're gonna make a really cheap one dollar.

295
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,254
Speaker 1: Yeah, Pocky's not really that filling.

296
00:21:17,657 --> 00:21:18,180
Speaker 0: It really is.

297
00:21:18,222 --> 00:21:20,609
Speaker 1: I mean I really like Pocky and I just kind of snagged on it.

298
00:21:20,629 --> 00:21:21,954
Speaker 0: I like some of the flavors of Pocky.

299
00:21:21,995 --> 00:21:27,234
Speaker 0: the strawberry Pocky is by far The most superior because it is the same filling as the strawberry koala.

300
00:21:27,374 --> 00:21:29,020
Speaker 1: Now see I like milk Pocky a lot.

301
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:31,394
Speaker 0: Of course that is really the best Japanese snack ever.

302
00:21:31,434 --> 00:21:32,320
Speaker 0: is the default koala?

303
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:34,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't get any other koala.

304
00:21:34,721 --> 00:21:41,220
Speaker 1: The default koala is pretty much the even though koalas that's the cheapest ass chocolate squirted into the inside.

305
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,495
Speaker 0: Oh, it sure is but the default koala is by far the greatest Japanese.

306
00:21:45,535 --> 00:21:46,940
Speaker 0: We need to do a show on Japanese snacks.

307
00:21:47,061 --> 00:21:48,720
Speaker 0: See the thing is talk about the gummies.

308
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:54,231
Speaker 1: We'll talk about the yen yen's because when I see people eating Pocky and it doesn't really bother me I just kind of makes me chuckle.

309
00:21:54,271 --> 00:22:01,320
Speaker 1: but when I eat Pocky I'll take like one stick and kind of nibble on it for a while It's kind of a you know, you nibble on it a little bit of flavor a little bit of flavor and it lasts you a while.

310
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:06,636
Speaker 1: I watch people at cons spend like five bucks to get this tiny ass thing of Pocky.

311
00:22:07,037 --> 00:22:09,208
Speaker 1: They'll open it up They'll grab all the sticks.

312
00:22:09,248 --> 00:22:11,180
Speaker 1: They'll eat them in the span of like ten seconds.

313
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:12,705
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is the thing.

314
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:17,320
Speaker 0: my problem with Pocky is that the sugary coating does not cover the whole Pocky.

315
00:22:17,581 --> 00:22:18,645
Speaker 1: It's not supposed to that way.

316
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:20,393
Speaker 1: your fingers don't get sticky when it melts.

317
00:22:20,413 --> 00:22:22,140
Speaker 0: I know but here's my problem.

318
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,827
Speaker 1: What's your problem?

319
00:22:22,847 --> 00:22:23,251
Speaker 0: Is in a?

320
00:22:23,372 --> 00:22:24,522
Speaker 0: you know, I take a bite I don't.

321
00:22:24,642 --> 00:22:25,246
Speaker 0: I try not to bite.

322
00:22:25,286 --> 00:22:27,579
Speaker 0: I could eat the whole thing in one go, but I don't.

323
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:35,780
Speaker 0: I take like one bite, you know Like I get a third of the sugary stuff then another third of the sugary stuff and then the final third of the sugary stuff.

324
00:22:36,362 --> 00:22:40,739
Speaker 0: Now I'm left with just this little bread bit and the bread bit doesn't really taste as good.

325
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,100
Speaker 1: It does.

326
00:22:41,181 --> 00:22:41,948
Speaker 1: I like the bread.

327
00:22:41,989 --> 00:22:43,019
Speaker 0: I don't like the bread bit.

328
00:22:43,301 --> 00:22:44,104
Speaker 0: I'm not a fan.

329
00:22:44,124 --> 00:22:45,972
Speaker 1: like not be a fan of the bread.

330
00:22:46,214 --> 00:22:49,206
Speaker 0: if I didn't feel bad about it I would throw the bread bit away.

331
00:22:49,227 --> 00:22:50,030
Speaker 0: Wow.

332
00:22:50,251 --> 00:22:52,260
Speaker 1: That's like those people who only eat the top of the muffin?

333
00:22:52,681 --> 00:22:54,429
Speaker 0: I know I hate those people because.

334
00:22:54,449 --> 00:22:56,598
Speaker 1: but or the people who cut only?

335
00:22:56,758 --> 00:22:58,760
Speaker 0: yeah I hate people who cut the crust off the sand.

336
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,171
Speaker 1: I like how you knew what I was gonna say.

337
00:23:00,252 --> 00:23:00,998
Speaker 0: the crust say it.

338
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:03,649
Speaker 0: yet The crust is where all the action is on the sandwich.

339
00:23:03,709 --> 00:23:05,376
Speaker 0: That's the best part of the bread case.

340
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:12,140
Speaker 1: in point to Bella's They make the best subs ever other than you know, delis in New York City run by awesome people.

341
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,997
Speaker 1: Yeah, but de Bella's the baked crust all around that sub bread is what makes 99% of that sandwich.

342
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:19,302
Speaker 0: It is.

343
00:23:19,663 --> 00:23:23,740
Speaker 0: but Pocky's the only thing where I I don't like the bready bit at the end.

344
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,105
Speaker 1: So you're one of those guys.

345
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:28,580
Speaker 0: yeah, but I do like Gundam models and I do like Pocky in general.

346
00:23:28,701 --> 00:23:32,543
Speaker 1: So so there's no reason for you to not buy this Too much money.

347
00:23:33,065 --> 00:23:34,769
Speaker 1: I'm sure we'll find available.

348
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:35,291
Speaker 1: We'll find it.

349
00:23:35,351 --> 00:23:37,156
Speaker 1: We'll find it somewhere for a reasonable price.

350
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:40,484
Speaker 0: if anyone's out in Japan Go check the stores.

351
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:41,588
Speaker 0: either some Gundam Pocky.

352
00:23:41,648 --> 00:23:43,334
Speaker 1: Yeah mail some back to Scott.

353
00:23:43,615 --> 00:23:44,899
Speaker 0: I'll send you five bucks.

354
00:23:46,703 --> 00:23:48,480
Speaker 0: I'll PayPal you five hours, right?

355
00:23:48,981 --> 00:23:50,947
Speaker 1: So we were gonna do cuz.

356
00:23:51,128 --> 00:23:53,957
Speaker 1: anime world order has been talking lately about you know, anime clubs.

357
00:23:53,977 --> 00:24:04,847
Speaker 1: they've been asking people to Tell them about their anime club and they have this thing about how anime club seemed to be failing and I recently emailed them and provided The counter example the RIT anime club.

358
00:24:04,867 --> 00:24:09,380
Speaker 1: that's doing just fine and it's freaking gigantic and you know various things like that.

359
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:14,960
Speaker 1: We're having a little back and forth But I realized as a result that we should do a show on how to run an anime club.

360
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,147
Speaker 0: We should do that partly

361
00:24:17,187 --> 00:24:25,035
Speaker 1: because we run that panel along with our friend Scott Johnson at I don't know almost every single major con in the northeastern United States,

362
00:24:25,557 --> 00:24:26,119
Speaker 0: yeah, and

363
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:41,179
Speaker 1: I mean other than that We ran the biggest freaking club in the country for years and years and the club's still doing really well even though these other clubs are failing and I told them that we would do that show this week and then Now it's late and I want to go to bed.

364
00:24:41,661 --> 00:24:48,628
Speaker 1: So instead we're gonna make peace with some of our listeners who have been bugging us for doing more comics on the show Which we haven't done in a while.

365
00:24:48,891 --> 00:24:52,974
Speaker 0: Oh, I see some people just went Yeah, and some other people just went off fuck and they turned it off.

366
00:24:53,195 --> 00:25:01,360
Speaker 1: Yeah But we're gonna talk about mouse guard which in my opinion is a really cool little comic but stay tuned for next week.

367
00:25:01,641 --> 00:25:09,680
Speaker 1: Well, we're going to tell you exactly in explicit detail how to make an anime club successful in the United States in the modern times.

368
00:25:10,202 --> 00:25:13,560
Speaker 0: Yes, and also we'll probably Skype in our friend Scott Johnson if he's available.

369
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:20,851
Speaker 1: Yeah We might have to make it a multi-part series considering that it tends to be a one or two hour panel at Conventions and we don't even cover half of it there.

370
00:25:20,871 --> 00:25:21,675
Speaker 1: Yep.

371
00:25:21,815 --> 00:25:33,736
Speaker 0: Anyway Mouse Guard, so Months ago when Mouse Card first hit the street, you know, it was just a little tiny indie comic about Adventuring mice and you know who buys that and it's only sold in comic book stores.

372
00:25:33,756 --> 00:25:34,900
Speaker 0: Not something you can find at borders.

373
00:25:34,981 --> 00:25:36,351
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't go to comic book stores.

374
00:25:36,391 --> 00:25:37,480
Speaker 1: I wouldn't know this existed.

375
00:25:37,821 --> 00:25:42,440
Speaker 0: So, you know who freakin knows about this thing, you know, not a lot of people go to comic book stores.

376
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,544
Speaker 0: They're buying the superheroes.

377
00:25:43,564 --> 00:25:45,290
Speaker 0: They're not buying the little adventuring mice.

378
00:25:45,852 --> 00:25:50,906
Speaker 0: So they did a very small print run and What do you know sold out?

379
00:25:51,588 --> 00:25:52,511
Speaker 0: So what did they do?

380
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,697
Speaker 0: They said oh shit and fucking sold out.

381
00:25:54,718 --> 00:25:55,379
Speaker 0: What do we do now?

382
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,804
Speaker 0: Oh print some more.

383
00:25:57,005 --> 00:25:59,055
Speaker 0: All right print some more sold out.

384
00:25:59,096 --> 00:26:03,353
Speaker 0: Mouse Guard number one I think is on like the fourth or fifth printing or something ridiculous like that.

385
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:07,879
Speaker 0: I mean in total numbers It's only sold I think tens of thousands of copies.

386
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:14,340
Speaker 0: But for an indie comic it's pretty much the hit indie comic of the year like far and away.

387
00:26:14,682 --> 00:26:22,860
Speaker 1: yeah, I mean take remember this I Generally do not enjoy the vast majority of American created comic books.

388
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:24,870
Speaker 1: I've said this openly and often.

389
00:26:25,271 --> 00:26:32,600
Speaker 1: you might have heard when Scott talked about Captain Marvell and all that and my feelings as to that comic.

390
00:26:33,522 --> 00:26:40,261
Speaker 1: So if I like a comic that's probably the most ringing endorsement you'll ever hear because it takes a lot for me to like a Comic.

391
00:26:40,622 --> 00:26:45,300
Speaker 1: Mouse Guard is probably one of my favorite comics other than Scott Pilgrim to come out in recent memory.

392
00:26:46,261 --> 00:26:53,733
Speaker 0: So if you try to buy like the first printing of Mouse Guard number one on eBay right now It'll cost you like a hundred bucks eighty bucks.

393
00:26:53,773 --> 00:26:55,380
Speaker 0: It's it's out of control Really?

394
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:04,857
Speaker 0: You can easily get though like the new the current printings of these things at the the comic book store or the Internet Or any other place that sells comic books.

395
00:27:04,897 --> 00:27:09,620
Speaker 0: now First thing you notice about Mouse Guard is it's a comic book sold issue by issue.

396
00:27:09,741 --> 00:27:11,669
Speaker 0: I think it's what a six-part series.

397
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, something like that and there's gonna be a trade.

398
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:19,703
Speaker 0: So if you wait and I if you you know, don't have a comic store I suggest you wait.

399
00:27:20,144 --> 00:27:27,352
Speaker 0: there will be I guarantee because I asked the guy who writes the damn thing David Peterson, David Peterson I saw him at Wizard World Philly.

400
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:28,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, he signed some of your books.

401
00:27:28,701 --> 00:27:32,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, not that I care, but he said there will be a trade.

402
00:27:32,641 --> 00:27:44,028
Speaker 0: So eventually perhaps probably next year sometime I don't know that you'll be able to go to borders or Walden books or where Barnes & Noble or Amazon and buy Mouse Guard the whole thing in one book.

403
00:27:44,631 --> 00:27:47,059
Speaker 0: So write it down and don't forget until then.

404
00:27:47,564 --> 00:27:49,260
Speaker 1: So what's Mouse Guard about?

405
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:56,282
Speaker 1: I mean, why would we go and not just us but half the internet and half the comic community go nuts about this Tiny little comic.

406
00:27:56,303 --> 00:28:02,280
Speaker 1: I mean the first one is 15 pages and it's kind of small and square and there are very few words in.

407
00:28:02,461 --> 00:28:10,388
Speaker 0: Yeah, it doesn't look like a comic book Like, you know, it's about as thick as a comic book and it's bound like a comic book But it looks like a record single cover.

408
00:28:10,408 --> 00:28:11,230
Speaker 0: It does.

409
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:29,378
Speaker 0: it looks like, you know, the tiny vinyl records, you know It's it's square and the cover is a little heavier stock than most comic books and the paper is heavier stock and the colors are Like I don't know what ink they use but it's really bright and a lot nicer than you know Most comic books these days with their newsprint or whatever they do it on

410
00:28:30,061 --> 00:28:34,740
Speaker 1: Because it's so few pages and just the way it is they seem to have gone really all out on the production values.

411
00:28:35,181 --> 00:28:35,602
Speaker 0: Yeah, what?

412
00:28:35,903 --> 00:28:36,725
Speaker 0: what's the publisher?

413
00:28:36,745 --> 00:28:40,616
Speaker 1: our chaos studio ass comics or our chaos studio press?

414
00:28:40,676 --> 00:28:40,896
Speaker 0: Yep.

415
00:28:40,936 --> 00:28:42,059
Speaker 0: That's her ass comics.

416
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:42,878
Speaker 1: calm That's right.

417
00:28:43,161 --> 00:28:51,538
Speaker 0: Our chaos publishes a whole lot of fantasy stuff and they basically picked up David Peterson who was doing the mouse guard thing on his own As soon as they said, oh shit, that's awesome.

418
00:28:52,500 --> 00:29:01,170
Speaker 1: So we can't really I mean we would review the comic in terms of talking about the plot in the story But it's so short and not a lot happens to where.

419
00:29:01,611 --> 00:29:07,200
Speaker 1: really ruining even a single plot detail Wouldn't would really do you guys a disservice, right?

420
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:16,039
Speaker 0: so I think the best way to go about this is we can talk about like the universe and the setting of mouse guard and This like the first like the setup of the first three pages or so.

421
00:29:16,283 --> 00:29:19,208
Speaker 1: so first off I mean forget about Mouse and Mouse guard.

422
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:37,876
Speaker 1: the setting here is simply kind of a Medieval low-technology era with little city-states here and there and there's this guard and the guard is kind of like an order of Knights and Rangers that protect the kingdom or the little city-state and protect travel routes and generally keep the peace.

423
00:29:38,438 --> 00:29:42,320
Speaker 0: Yep, and You know, there isn't really a lot of magic going on.

424
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:47,310
Speaker 0: I mean there might be but it's not like this Wizards casting fireballs It's magic more like medieval.

425
00:29:47,351 --> 00:29:48,879
Speaker 1: people believe a lot of funny things.

426
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:49,802
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean these.

427
00:29:49,822 --> 00:29:55,900
Speaker 0: they have swords and daggers and shields and armors and cloaks and general medieval action.

428
00:29:56,201 --> 00:29:58,047
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like that general medieval action.

429
00:29:58,288 --> 00:29:58,449
Speaker 0: Yep.

430
00:29:59,091 --> 00:30:01,620
Speaker 0: The other thing they've got is political intrigue.

431
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:04,869
Speaker 1: Yes, but I mean the first plot starts out very simple.

432
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:08,960
Speaker 1: just a farmer is traveling carrying a shipment of grain and he disappears.

433
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:15,778
Speaker 1: So three guardsmen go out to find him and in the course of this they end up fighting a giant snake.

434
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,863
Speaker 0: Oh My god a giant snake.

435
00:30:18,044 --> 00:30:31,220
Speaker 1: and also the actual plot or the leanings of the real plot are introduced to you And it is very much a kind of political intrigue between city-states warring factions kind of cool medieval style plot.

436
00:30:31,441 --> 00:30:32,163
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's one.

437
00:30:32,283 --> 00:30:47,040
Speaker 0: It's that standard plot hook that works really well every time where there's a very very small and Insignificant like task and you mean like a hobbit traveling through some cave and he happens to pick up a ring along the way.

438
00:30:47,981 --> 00:30:54,540
Speaker 1: No, it's a little more subtle than that, you know, but like three mice going out to figure out what happened to a fourth mouse.

439
00:30:54,902 --> 00:31:01,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, you know that you go out and it's like, okay We're going to go catch this robber and then you catch the robber.

440
00:31:01,641 --> 00:31:05,280
Speaker 0: But then you realize there's more to this than just catching a rob.

441
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,835
Speaker 1: Yeah, like you open his bag after you kill him and he didn't have money.

442
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:09,980
Speaker 1: He had a nuclear bomb.

443
00:31:11,724 --> 00:31:16,019
Speaker 0: So, you know or wait a minute, there's a whole mafia behind that, you know, something like that.

444
00:31:16,982 --> 00:31:21,934
Speaker 0: So that's what mouse guard is and I don't want to spoil anything because it's okay.

445
00:31:22,075 --> 00:31:25,180
Speaker 1: now that alone would be an average You know medieval story.

446
00:31:25,281 --> 00:31:33,902
Speaker 1: I mean it would be made or broken based more on how it was executed and the art and the dialogue than it would on the actual plot because the plot is very simple.

447
00:31:34,605 --> 00:31:40,126
Speaker 1: but mouse guard in addition to all that is about mice and It's not like.

448
00:31:40,226 --> 00:31:42,819
Speaker 1: they go out of their way to make it mousey.

449
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:49,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, not like, you know, you read something like rats of NIMH, which I love and red wall Which I surprisingly don't like at all.

450
00:31:49,229 --> 00:31:50,995
Speaker 0: I write course granted.

451
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:52,320
Speaker 0: I haven't read it since middle school.

452
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,986
Speaker 1: You ever see the rats of NIMH movie?

453
00:31:54,347 --> 00:31:57,317
Speaker 1: No, but I got a rant about that.

454
00:31:57,598 --> 00:32:00,627
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the Rats of NIMH the book is great.

455
00:32:00,787 --> 00:32:01,289
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

456
00:32:01,329 --> 00:32:03,177
Speaker 0: I think I read the sequel, but I don't remember it.

457
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:05,786
Speaker 0: and Red wall, you know those.

458
00:32:06,247 --> 00:32:06,508
Speaker 0: what?

459
00:32:06,548 --> 00:32:08,113
Speaker 0: who's the guy who writes those things?

460
00:32:08,213 --> 00:32:10,180
Speaker 1: Oh god, I don't remember but I like red wall.

461
00:32:10,542 --> 00:32:13,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I read one of them in middle school and didn't like it.

462
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:16,313
Speaker 0: So I can't say whether I'd like it now, but I didn't like it then.

463
00:32:16,594 --> 00:32:17,959
Speaker 0: but this is supposed like.

464
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:27,558
Speaker 0: Supposedly the mouse guard guy didn't even know about red wall when he came up with it or so I hear there's an interview with him on What's that podcast?

465
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:28,944
Speaker 0: Indie spinner rack.

466
00:32:29,084 --> 00:32:31,477
Speaker 0: Yeah, we met those guys at mocha remember for like two minutes.

467
00:32:31,537 --> 00:32:31,698
Speaker 0: Yep.

468
00:32:31,758 --> 00:32:34,656
Speaker 1: Yep But I mean in terms it's just it.

469
00:32:34,676 --> 00:32:39,595
Speaker 1: that whole story We read is the plot except that they're mice and they don't go out like.

470
00:32:39,615 --> 00:32:42,320
Speaker 1: they don't say like, haha I am a mouse.

471
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:48,020
Speaker 1: It's just they're mice and like say one of them has a weapon and the weapon happens to be a fish hook.

472
00:32:48,465 --> 00:32:49,699
Speaker 1: They don't say it's a fish hook.

473
00:32:49,981 --> 00:32:54,820
Speaker 1: They don't zoom out and show like the human drop in the facial didn't show humans.

474
00:32:55,562 --> 00:32:56,565
Speaker 1: None of that it.

475
00:32:56,585 --> 00:32:59,214
Speaker 1: just the guy has a fish hook and he uses it as a weapon.

476
00:32:59,635 --> 00:33:00,358
Speaker 1: and that's that.

477
00:33:00,418 --> 00:33:01,100
Speaker 1: it's just part of the.

478
00:33:01,663 --> 00:33:04,880
Speaker 0: It's like all the mousiness of it really is in the illustration.

479
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:19,800
Speaker 0: You could take the writing of this comic and totally change the setting just by changing all the pictures to have them be humans or aliens or some other anthropomorphic Beast of some sort, you know, it's just the way it's drawn.

480
00:33:20,182 --> 00:33:22,680
Speaker 0: They're mice and you know big thing.

481
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:28,037
Speaker 0: You know things that are small to us are big and dangerous to them and they use very tiny things.

482
00:33:28,118 --> 00:33:34,375
Speaker 1: and that's how it So like a human night would fight a dragon and a mouse night fights a normal snake or a crab.

483
00:33:34,897 --> 00:33:36,532
Speaker 1: Oh, yes the crabs crabs.

484
00:33:37,522 --> 00:33:47,699
Speaker 1: But genius, I mean really it's such a standard straight-up cool medieval plot and the atmosphere of the mousiness Just for some reason adds so much charm to it.

485
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:58,192
Speaker 0: Yeah, the other thing is a lot of you know stories that use like an anthropomorphic mice and other things Stories about adventuring cats or something like that.

486
00:33:58,353 --> 00:34:00,140
Speaker 0: if they're I'm sure there are some puss in boots.

487
00:34:00,321 --> 00:34:17,232
Speaker 0: Yeah, they tend to not have like, you know, the super intelligent plots, you know, it's this the plot is so highbrow like with its political intrigues and Social commentaries, you know, I mean not much happens because it's.

488
00:34:17,373 --> 00:34:25,398
Speaker 1: we only got about four little tiny comic issues Yeah, but yet there's such a world within the comic that they don't directly tell you about.

489
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:26,000
Speaker 1: it's just there.

490
00:34:26,061 --> 00:34:27,418
Speaker 1: It's kind of this atmosphere around it.

491
00:34:27,844 --> 00:34:36,597
Speaker 1: It's obvious that the author Put a lot more effort into the world that is shown in the comic like he built all the backstory in Order to write this story within it.

492
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:46,960
Speaker 1: I mean if I read the the opening bit from you know Before the comic starts kind of the preamble the mice struggle to live safely and prosper among all the world's harsh conditions and predators.

493
00:34:47,462 --> 00:35:02,836
Speaker 1: Thus the mouse guard was formed after persevering against the weasel warlord in the Winter War of 1149. the territories are no longer is troubled true the day-to-day dangers exist, but no longer are the guard soldiers Yeah, but no longer are the guard soldiers.

494
00:35:03,219 --> 00:35:08,900
Speaker 1: instead They are escorts pathfinders weather watchers scouts and bodyguards for the mice who live among the territories.

495
00:35:09,363 --> 00:35:11,980
Speaker 1: Many skills are necessary for the guard to keep the border safe.

496
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:21,307
Speaker 1: They must find new Safeways and paths from village to village leads shipments of goods from one town to another and in case of attack Guard against all evil and harm to their territories.

497
00:35:21,768 --> 00:35:22,971
Speaker 1: hail to those who are able.

498
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:26,963
Speaker 1: any mouse can any mouse will but the guard Prevail.

499
00:35:27,385 --> 00:35:30,860
Speaker 1: yep, it was a little hard to read the fonts kind of funny, and I kept losing my place.

500
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:31,943
Speaker 1: So I apologize.

501
00:35:31,983 --> 00:35:32,945
Speaker 0: it's a nice font though.

502
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:37,437
Speaker 1: It is it's just not a nice font for reading extemporaneously into a microphone.

503
00:35:37,878 --> 00:35:45,545
Speaker 0: Yeah So there's three main characters the three guards mice and then every other character is basically yeah Not a guards.

504
00:35:45,585 --> 00:35:47,738
Speaker 1: my Liam Kenzie and Saxon.

505
00:35:47,939 --> 00:35:49,885
Speaker 0: yeah I don't know which ones are which.

506
00:35:50,326 --> 00:35:55,140
Speaker 1: Liam is the like young brash really funny guy with the green cloak.

507
00:35:55,762 --> 00:36:00,859
Speaker 1: Kenzie is kind of the old wise one traveling with them and Saxon is the gruff fighter.

508
00:36:00,879 --> 00:36:02,904
Speaker 0: ah Yep, that's correct.

509
00:36:02,924 --> 00:36:03,164
Speaker 0: Yep.

510
00:36:03,185 --> 00:36:03,345
Speaker 0: Yes.

511
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:06,877
Speaker 0: Yeah, and there you have it your adventuring party.

512
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,716
Speaker 1: now I really want to take a moment to talk about the art because the art adds so much to this.

513
00:36:11,776 --> 00:36:13,608
Speaker 0: the arts pretty much the Whole damn thing.

514
00:36:13,628 --> 00:36:14,819
Speaker 0: when you get right down to it.

515
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:21,823
Speaker 1: I mean the mice are really kind of stylized, but I hate to say this, but they're in many cases Absolutely adorable.

516
00:36:22,424 --> 00:36:25,433
Speaker 0: it depends on the and the panel but in some panels.

517
00:36:25,493 --> 00:36:27,478
Speaker 0: It's like you a mouse and other panels.

518
00:36:27,538 --> 00:36:36,179
Speaker 1: It's like But their faces are so expressive and yet there don't seem to be a lot of liberties taken in terms of stylizing the faces.

519
00:36:36,259 --> 00:36:40,720
Speaker 1: most of their Emotion is expressed merely through the way they hold their eyes and their whiskers.

520
00:36:41,381 --> 00:36:44,093
Speaker 0: Yeah, sometimes the mouth is open and the ears.

521
00:36:44,214 --> 00:36:45,138
Speaker 0: actually he does a lot.

522
00:36:45,179 --> 00:36:53,080
Speaker 0: Yes Yes You know sometimes the ears like folded one way or the other and that change and also the direction the head is facing is huge.

523
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,850
Speaker 0: It's like whenever their head is pointing up.

524
00:36:55,352 --> 00:36:56,378
Speaker 0: It's always kind of cute.

525
00:36:57,263 --> 00:36:58,653
Speaker 0: Whatever the head is pointing down.

526
00:36:58,673 --> 00:37:02,765
Speaker 0: It's kind of like And it does.

527
00:37:02,785 --> 00:37:05,860
Speaker 0: it doesn't do any use of the angle of the head instead of eyebrows.

528
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,480
Speaker 1: I mean, it's definitely not you know a manga or anything and it doesn't really have like super deformed or any of that stuff.

529
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:23,480
Speaker 1: But there are many cases when a mouse that's in the background or whenever they draw a mouse small They'll very pointedly use dot eyes and a kind of more stylized mouse and it's very cute.

530
00:37:24,002 --> 00:37:26,939
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm looking at one right now and I almost want to just crack up.

531
00:37:27,622 --> 00:37:33,300
Speaker 1: But at the same time on that same page is the mice doing something kind of horrible.

532
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,102
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah They're.

533
00:37:35,143 --> 00:37:37,423
Speaker 0: all the background are is Like.

534
00:37:37,483 --> 00:37:38,186
Speaker 0: it's like the mouse.

535
00:37:38,568 --> 00:37:41,300
Speaker 0: the mice really kind of stand out from the backgrounds at all times.

536
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,303
Speaker 0: Yes It's a good thing.

537
00:37:42,384 --> 00:37:43,107
Speaker 0: the camera

538
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:54,159
Speaker 1: if there were a camera is very low like the camera is Underneath the mice that almost all times you're always looking up at them You almost immediately forget the fact that they're small mice and it feels like they're as big as us

539
00:37:54,821 --> 00:37:56,086
Speaker 0: Except for when there's something bigger.

540
00:37:56,106 --> 00:38:01,308
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even then I mean you see a crab and you don't feel like wow Look how small the mouse is.

541
00:38:01,368 --> 00:38:02,052
Speaker 1: That's a crab.

542
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:04,485
Speaker 1: you feel like wow That crab is huge.

543
00:38:04,786 --> 00:38:08,160
Speaker 0: Yep, but like everything else that's not a mouse.

544
00:38:08,701 --> 00:38:14,597
Speaker 0: That's drawn is sort of like this like fantasy style that you know, what's the who's the guy who painted with the dots?

545
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:21,320
Speaker 1: I Can think of a lot of impressionist people who painted with dots, you know, they were instead of you didn't do the brushstrokes.

546
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:21,824
Speaker 0: He just did.

547
00:38:22,005 --> 00:38:23,093
Speaker 0: you know a bunch of colored dots.

548
00:38:23,214 --> 00:38:23,919
Speaker 0: It's sort of like that.

549
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:26,370
Speaker 0: There's lots of dots and just simple lines.

550
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:28,580
Speaker 0: There's a whole lot of them and that's what makes the backgrounds.

551
00:38:28,961 --> 00:38:30,145
Speaker 1: Yeah, the backgrounds are also.

552
00:38:30,205 --> 00:38:33,234
Speaker 1: they're very atmospheric and they're in fact even the panels.

553
00:38:33,254 --> 00:38:36,885
Speaker 1: there are a lot of panels that kind of do Really not plot.

554
00:38:36,906 --> 00:38:37,668
Speaker 1: important setup.

555
00:38:37,708 --> 00:38:49,470
Speaker 1: Just a lot of you know a mouse standing there or while they're talking It cuts to like a shot of the three of them from underneath and then while they're talking still it cuts to like one of them Holding the sword and then it cuts to like the Sun setting.

556
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:52,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the backgrounds they really aren't busy either.

557
00:38:52,321 --> 00:38:54,700
Speaker 0: It's like he puts just enough there to be necessary.

558
00:38:55,122 --> 00:39:03,960
Speaker 0: I mean like here's a frame with two mice fighting and you can tell there's a crowd of mice watching But it's basically just a brown splotch with some lines around it, you know.

559
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:09,520
Speaker 0: But you can totally tell what it is and it keeps your focus on what's important because the mice in the frame look really cool.

560
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,047
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah, it's not a bad thing.

561
00:39:11,108 --> 00:39:12,434
Speaker 0: It's just that's the way it is.

562
00:39:12,454 --> 00:39:14,784
Speaker 0: There's a lot of frames So there is no background.

563
00:39:14,825 --> 00:39:16,752
Speaker 0: It's just like they're in a place with dirt.

564
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:18,640
Speaker 0: So it's it's kind of brown with shadows.

565
00:39:19,362 --> 00:39:19,744
Speaker 1: I mean it.

566
00:39:20,045 --> 00:39:21,128
Speaker 1: there's kind of the conundrum of.

567
00:39:21,189 --> 00:39:26,186
Speaker 1: it's hard to really talk about something easily if you like it and I'm sure we were a little bit redundant.

568
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:30,480
Speaker 1: and it's also hard considering that we didn't want to talk about the plot at all.

569
00:39:30,794 --> 00:39:30,940
Speaker 1: Yeah

570
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:36,286
Speaker 0: It's we got such a small amount of material to work with and if we say any amount of it We basically ruin the whole thing not

571
00:39:36,306 --> 00:39:40,763
Speaker 1: to mention the fact that we did this episode because we didn't feel like doing the other episode We were supposed to do.

572
00:39:41,305 --> 00:39:43,011
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's good to pimp mouse guy.

573
00:39:43,111 --> 00:39:45,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just you know, I mean, it's basically.

574
00:39:45,961 --> 00:39:49,620
Speaker 0: It's already a hit but it's like a hit in like this subculture.

575
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:54,780
Speaker 0: So people outside don't know that there's this awesome thing hiding away somewhere for them to go get.

576
00:39:55,482 --> 00:39:58,050
Speaker 1: Mouse guard is so worth it to read.

577
00:39:58,231 --> 00:39:59,796
Speaker 1: I can't recommend it enough.

578
00:40:00,117 --> 00:40:05,309
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean It's 350 an issue and I think there's five issues out now.

579
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:07,255
Speaker 0: So it's a 15 bucks.

580
00:40:07,496 --> 00:40:09,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, it takes almost no commitment.

581
00:40:09,501 --> 00:40:10,865
Speaker 1: It's actually really short.

582
00:40:10,985 --> 00:40:11,727
Speaker 1: It's really good.

583
00:40:12,188 --> 00:40:16,580
Speaker 1: Even if you hate it, you've invested so little into it that you might as well go for it.

584
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:25,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if you're really, you know, if you're really stuck up about it You know just go like read one at a store a comic book store or buy one issue online.

585
00:40:25,401 --> 00:40:26,626
Speaker 0: It's easy to get a new printing.

586
00:40:26,667 --> 00:40:28,716
Speaker 0: Don't waste $100 in the first printing.

587
00:40:28,736 --> 00:40:29,520
Speaker 0: what the hell's wrong with you?

588
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,614
Speaker 1: In fact, if nothing else just buy the first one the first comic.

589
00:40:33,674 --> 00:40:33,815
Speaker 1: it's 350.

590
00:40:33,815 --> 00:40:39,720
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm sure you can find it and if you're not hooked by the first comic don't bother.

591
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:53,040
Speaker 0: But if you like the first comic at all, if you're a fan of fantasy anything or comic anything I can pretty much guarantee you're gonna go Oh shits and buy the rest or wait for the trade and cry every day until the trade comes out.

592
00:40:53,123 --> 00:40:57,751
Speaker 1: Yeah because seriously Even if these this weren't about mice I would probably still like it.

593
00:40:57,831 --> 00:41:02,968
Speaker 1: the fact that it's about mice and it's about mice in such An amazing and well put together way.

594
00:41:02,988 --> 00:41:03,992
Speaker 1: It's just bonus.

595
00:41:04,012 --> 00:41:04,253
Speaker 1: It's just.

596
00:41:04,334 --> 00:41:05,960
Speaker 0: it's like anyone can make a fantasy comic.

597
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:09,369
Speaker 0: There's plenty of anyone can make you know, an anthropomorphic mice comic.

598
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:13,180
Speaker 0: It's nothing to make a really damn good fantasy comic.

599
00:41:13,421 --> 00:41:21,292
Speaker 0: Yeah, and also have the really clever, you know and not the Kind of played out anthropomorphic mice setting.

600
00:41:21,573 --> 00:41:26,334
Speaker 0: it's like all double bonus super combo Hundred hits you go down.

601
00:41:26,998 --> 00:41:27,259
Speaker 0: I win.

602
00:41:28,542 --> 00:41:32,300
Speaker 1: And also one last bit not about mouse guard, but about Wednesday shows.

603
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:40,060
Speaker 1: We've talked a bit about how we're going to do another final thought slash spoiler episode in the future and we've asked for your feedback.

604
00:41:40,381 --> 00:41:44,597
Speaker 1: So we took all the nominations and in the forums on our website front row crew calm.

00:41:44,657 --> 00:41:50,854
Speaker 1: right now There is a poll that if you are a registered member of the forums You can see and vote in once.

Speaker 1: We're giving you a few weeks to make sure you know everyone who wants to vote has voted.

608
00:41:55,969 --> 00:42:01,999
Speaker 1: we are going to fully analyze whatever show you've picked as We did with big o2 many moons ago.

609
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:11,760
Speaker 0: So if you would like us to fully analyze, you know in great detail a particular anime that we have seen including You know the end and the spoilers and everything.

612
00:42:23,301 --> 00:42:24,506
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's kind of lame.

613
00:42:24,686 --> 00:42:25,409
Speaker 0: that is kind of lame.

614
00:42:25,429 --> 00:42:28,060
Speaker 0: If you listen to this show, you should really join the forum.

615
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:28,763
Speaker 0: What's wrong with you?

616
00:42:28,903 --> 00:42:31,032
Speaker 1: Yeah, the forums are actually really really rocking.

617
00:42:31,454 --> 00:42:32,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can't keep up with them anymore.

618
00:42:33,101 --> 00:42:44,460
Speaker 1: Also, if you don't want us to do a show like say you've never seen try gun for some reason Which is actually right now the front-runner You might want to vote against it because try guns awesome and you won't be able to listen until you watch try gun.

619
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:54,519
Speaker 1: It seems to be between try gun and Ava at this point Though ghost in the shell standalone complex and samurai chamblee have a surprising number of votes so far.

620
00:42:55,441 --> 00:42:57,490
Speaker 0: That's good because both those shows are cool.

621
00:42:57,892 --> 00:42:59,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what are we gonna say about samurai chamblee?

622
00:43:00,521 --> 00:43:01,083
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's.

623
00:43:01,103 --> 00:43:02,851
Speaker 0: the thing is that there's a lot you could.

624
00:43:02,891 --> 00:43:11,418
Speaker 0: we could probably talk about the show for a whole episode you know detailing the whole thing, but It's not a deep show as deep as some of the other ones.

625
00:43:11,438 --> 00:43:18,549
Speaker 1: Yeah hidden meanings like in the very least philosophical Analyzing like standalone complex in the very least.

626
00:43:18,569 --> 00:43:23,363
Speaker 1: we would talk about a certain thing that happens and spend a whole episode talking about that Thing pretty much.

627
00:43:23,404 --> 00:43:26,955
Speaker 1: Yeah the thing that we can't talk about because it's probably the biggest spoiler in the whole show.

628
00:43:26,976 --> 00:43:29,846
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, though try gun.

629
00:43:29,866 --> 00:43:32,134
Speaker 1: We could probably do multiple episodes on and Ava.

630
00:43:32,255 --> 00:43:33,279
Speaker 1: God we have a week.

631
00:43:35,064 --> 00:43:36,058
Speaker 1: Will they do ten a month?

632
00:43:38,121 --> 00:43:40,659
Speaker 1: And we'll be tied if we ever watch fist of the North Star?

633
00:43:41,182 --> 00:43:44,660
Speaker 0: Well, but I'd if we like if you would freakin read all six volumes of Akira.

634
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:45,783
Speaker 0: We need to cure a year.

635
00:43:46,084 --> 00:43:50,177
Speaker 1: God we could do the Akira movie, but you know what he blows.

636
00:43:50,197 --> 00:43:53,126
Speaker 1: it gets big and fat It turns into a blob crushes people.

637
00:43:53,146 --> 00:43:54,851
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the end of Akira.

638
00:43:55,112 --> 00:43:57,399
Speaker 1: And you know what everyone dies in the end of Ava.

639
00:43:58,421 --> 00:44:01,299
Speaker 0: Yeah, is the thing with the Akira movie is that it's really good.

640
00:44:01,841 --> 00:44:07,820
Speaker 0: But then if you read the Akira manga the movie doesn't seem so good anymore because the manga is just so damn good.

641
00:44:08,101 --> 00:44:11,416
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's not to say that Akira is a is not a good movie.

642
00:44:11,456 --> 00:44:12,220
Speaker 1: It's fantastic.

643
00:44:12,421 --> 00:44:13,485
Speaker 1: It's like with roller coasters.

644
00:44:13,505 --> 00:44:18,439
Speaker 1: if you go to cedar point and you ride the magnum XL 200 which was at one point the tallest roller coaster in the world.

645
00:44:19,003 --> 00:44:20,611
Speaker 1: It's an amazing roller coaster.

646
00:44:21,093 --> 00:44:26,420
Speaker 1: if you ride the millennium force Which is a hundred and something feet taller than that and so much better.

647
00:44:27,062 --> 00:44:28,485
Speaker 1: It's an amazing roller coaster.

648
00:44:28,906 --> 00:44:36,078
Speaker 1: if you ride the millennium force first and you go back and try to ride the magnum XL 200 You'll just be thinking what the fuck is this shit Charles?

649
00:44:37,683 --> 00:44:38,816
Speaker 0: That's exactly what it is.

650
00:44:38,877 --> 00:44:44,900
Speaker 0: so Everyone should read the Akira manga because it's so good, but you should watch the Akira movie first.

651
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:49,515
Speaker 0: Yeah, you have the maximum enjoyment in your life and then go watch the Akira movie again, and you'll go.

652
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:55,000
Speaker 1: Oh Plus the Akira movie leaves a lot to be explained.

653
00:44:55,301 --> 00:44:57,692
Speaker 1: You'll probably wonder about a lot of what was going on.

654
00:44:57,813 --> 00:44:59,380
Speaker 0: is we could do a whole episode of this?

655
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,519
Speaker 0: Let's not let's stop doing an entire other episode and save it.

656
00:45:03,001 --> 00:45:07,940
Speaker 1: Suffice to say read mouse guard read Akira, and we'll see you tomorrow.
