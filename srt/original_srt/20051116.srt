1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,963
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday November 16th, and this is deep nuts tonight.

2
00:00:13,023 --> 00:00:17,809
Speaker 1: We talk about anime specifically Gankotsuo and the place promised in our early days.

3
00:00:19,494 --> 00:00:20,201
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:20,504 --> 00:00:20,889
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

5
00:00:22,092 --> 00:00:25,584
Speaker 1: So, uh, we stopped playing Mario Kart just long enough to make this podcast.

6
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:26,668
Speaker 0: That's about right.

7
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:29,804
Speaker 0: Yeah I played three online games today.

8
00:00:29,824 --> 00:00:30,849
Speaker 0: I won all of them.

9
00:00:32,036 --> 00:00:32,442
Speaker 0: I'm so great.

10
00:00:32,827 --> 00:00:35,277
Speaker 1: Yep So, uh, I work today.

11
00:00:35,297 --> 00:00:37,725
Speaker 1: I've been struggling with this server.

12
00:00:38,187 --> 00:00:39,190
Speaker 0: I've been struggling with all that.

13
00:00:39,532 --> 00:00:41,904
Speaker 1: Yeah, I hate all that but I hate the server more.

14
00:00:41,924 --> 00:00:46,142
Speaker 1: to make it And slightly confidential.

15
00:00:46,182 --> 00:00:50,940
Speaker 1: story short I built a server I put a raid card in the raid card died.

16
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:52,405
Speaker 1: I put another raid card in.

17
00:00:52,727 --> 00:00:53,610
Speaker 1: that card died.

18
00:00:53,871 --> 00:01:02,694
Speaker 1: I then learned that that motherboard somehow specifically destroys that and only that raid car put a different raid card in And Eventually, I got everything working.

19
00:01:02,755 --> 00:01:07,350
Speaker 1: I was very happy and then just today a stick of RAM died and I wanted to cry.

20
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:10,638
Speaker 0: This computer must be cursed something like that.

21
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,567
Speaker 0: Can't you get like another computer just like it?

22
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:14,310
Speaker 0: that doesn't have a curse?

23
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,575
Speaker 1: No, because there's only.

24
00:01:16,595 --> 00:01:17,839
Speaker 1: we only have two of the like.

25
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:21,470
Speaker 1: this is an old kind of server and they don't make them anymore.

26
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,930
Speaker 1: And this I don't need a powerful server.

27
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:28,340
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna spend money to buy like a brand new blade or anything.

28
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,149
Speaker 0: You spend someone else's money to buy a brand new.

29
00:01:33,812 --> 00:01:35,890
Speaker 0: I'll just spend your money unless it's going in this house.

30
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,789
Speaker 1: Yeah I do my job at work the same way I do computers here.

31
00:01:39,692 --> 00:01:41,801
Speaker 1: If I have a computer laying around that'll do the job.

32
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:43,710
Speaker 1: I don't spend money on a new computer unless I have to.

33
00:01:45,311 --> 00:01:47,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess that's kind of okay.

34
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:49,670
Speaker 1: that way if I really need to spend money later, I can spend money.

35
00:01:50,252 --> 00:01:51,155
Speaker 0: It's good for the company.

36
00:01:51,196 --> 00:01:54,870
Speaker 0: But you know, sometimes you don't necessarily want what's good for the company.

37
00:01:55,773 --> 00:01:56,375
Speaker 1: I usually do.

38
00:01:56,596 --> 00:01:58,984
Speaker 1: the problem is sometimes the company doesn't want what's good for the company.

39
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, people don't like bad medicine They're new.

40
00:02:02,441 --> 00:02:15,325
Speaker 1: No, it's like All right, yeah, so uh Today I saw that AOL Added some bots to everyone's buddy list.

41
00:02:15,366 --> 00:02:16,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, I read this story.

42
00:02:16,673 --> 00:02:22,490
Speaker 0: But then you know I completely forgot about it until I got home because I can't really sign in to aim at work because the network's broken.

43
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:25,344
Speaker 0: My jabber aim transport doesn't even work at work.

44
00:02:25,947 --> 00:02:26,389
Speaker 0: work at work.

45
00:02:27,052 --> 00:02:35,049
Speaker 0: But as soon as I got home, I signed into aim and these two bots appeared and I was like, oh my god It happened even on GA on Linux.

46
00:02:35,835 --> 00:02:37,769
Speaker 1: See it even happens in trillion has happened to max.

47
00:02:38,231 --> 00:02:44,951
Speaker 1: But the thing is I saw all these reports and I looked and they weren't in my list and then I got home and they weren't There.

48
00:02:45,836 --> 00:02:47,464
Speaker 1: so I was thinking what am I immune?

49
00:02:47,745 --> 00:02:48,549
Speaker 1: Did it skip me?

50
00:02:49,394 --> 00:02:54,870
Speaker 1: And then I realized that I hadn't logged out of aim Since a power outage a while ago.

51
00:02:55,711 --> 00:02:58,221
Speaker 1: So I logged out of aim and I logged back in and they appeared.

52
00:02:58,723 --> 00:03:00,510
Speaker 1: I said some obscenities to him for a while.

53
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:01,263
Speaker 1: Then I deleted him.

54
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,414
Speaker 0: Obscenities.

55
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:06,590
Speaker 0: see I wouldn't really mind the bots if they didn't force them on you.

56
00:03:07,292 --> 00:03:11,587
Speaker 0: I think the reason they forced them on you really is to just inform you of the new feature that they're.

57
00:03:11,728 --> 00:03:12,457
Speaker 0: they gave you Yeah.

58
00:03:13,071 --> 00:03:19,215
Speaker 0: But I mean if they just had a thing where you could add bots if you wanted and some of them were useful and they Didn't send you advertising.

59
00:03:19,235 --> 00:03:19,958
Speaker 0: That's always cool.

60
00:03:20,339 --> 00:03:21,623
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that's what they have now.

61
00:03:21,704 --> 00:03:22,928
Speaker 1: kind of they've there add they.

62
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:26,720
Speaker 1: basically There's always been this API for having bots in a. no always.

63
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,330
Speaker 1: but now they legitimized it and it's an official thing And they're just gonna start putting out more and more official bots.

64
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:37,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, well Jabber has always been the king of bots and now the Jabber is kind of moving with the Google talk.

65
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,706
Speaker 0: I think they want to you know, kind of head it off at the pass.

66
00:03:40,068 --> 00:03:48,502
Speaker 1: Yeah the only thing I don't get is I didn't like the bots appearing but it wasn't a crushing blow against my computer.

67
00:03:48,523 --> 00:03:58,979
Speaker 1: sovereignty sovereignty, no, not really, but uh the sheer poison and vehemence that I heard on Slashdot and Fark of people screaming.

68
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,203
Speaker 1: How could they do this?

69
00:04:00,524 --> 00:04:02,170
Speaker 1: those bastards blah blah blah.

70
00:04:04,051 --> 00:04:06,358
Speaker 1: I mean AOL aim is kind of free.

71
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:07,100
Speaker 1: So you really can't.

72
00:04:07,642 --> 00:04:10,049
Speaker 1: I mean you can complain but you can't expect them to listen to you.

73
00:04:10,611 --> 00:04:12,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually AOL is kind of turning around.

74
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,490
Speaker 0: I mean they used to be all bastardly and whatnot.

75
00:04:15,931 --> 00:04:27,366
Speaker 0: But you know, they redid the aim client and they added all the good stuff, but they piled up on the ads like crazy You know, but they're letting all the G aims and trillions slide their ads in the aim client.

76
00:04:27,907 --> 00:04:29,613
Speaker 0: crazy ads I haven't.

77
00:04:29,713 --> 00:04:34,730
Speaker 1: I seriously have not used the official AOL client in like seven years.

78
00:04:35,332 --> 00:04:41,030
Speaker 0: I haven't used the official aim client in longer than that except for why I think I use the everybody once.

79
00:04:41,451 --> 00:04:46,273
Speaker 1: See I never even used aim until I got to college and all of you bastards used aim and I had to stop using ICQ.

80
00:04:46,293 --> 00:04:47,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't.

81
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:49,390
Speaker 0: I like having a name and not a number.

82
00:04:49,912 --> 00:04:51,016
Speaker 1: I liked having a number.

83
00:04:51,398 --> 00:04:53,486
Speaker 1: that way I could have whatever name I wanted now.

84
00:04:53,566 --> 00:04:56,095
Speaker 1: I'm shizar 105.

85
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:57,090
Speaker 0: it's not my fault.

86
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:01,028
Speaker 0: You weren't cool enough to get shizar first or cool enough to have a unique name.

87
00:05:01,148 --> 00:05:01,550
Speaker 0: You know what?

88
00:05:01,671 --> 00:05:03,389
Speaker 1: It's great because in Jabber I've got rim.

89
00:05:04,491 --> 00:05:05,759
Speaker 0: Yeah, Jabber is King.

90
00:05:06,384 --> 00:05:07,310
Speaker 0: everyone should use Jabber.

91
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,692
Speaker 0: You know what?

92
00:05:07,732 --> 00:05:11,150
Speaker 0: if you use Jabber you won't have people randomly adding bots to your buddy list.

93
00:05:11,971 --> 00:05:15,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, unless the server admin decides to add bots to your buddy list.

94
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,886
Speaker 0: But and then when the server admin is me, and I don't know how to do that.

95
00:05:18,926 --> 00:05:19,610
Speaker 0: You have no worries.

96
00:05:21,975 --> 00:05:25,538
Speaker 0: So You know, I got a little iPod nano, right?

97
00:05:25,999 --> 00:05:27,305
Speaker 1: Yeah, you didn't break this one.

98
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:28,389
Speaker 0: No, not yet.

99
00:05:29,992 --> 00:05:30,434
Speaker 0: And I was.

100
00:05:30,515 --> 00:05:33,170
Speaker 0: you know, the other day there was the doom for the iPod nano.

101
00:05:33,211 --> 00:05:39,210
Speaker 0: All right The one that you couldn't get to work the one that I couldn't get to work But only cuz I was dumb and I'm not gonna try it again cuz I really never need for it.

102
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,365
Speaker 0: It's just I was trying to be cool.

103
00:05:41,232 --> 00:05:46,690
Speaker 0: But you know when the doom came out for the nano I was like, yeah, it has a color screen.

104
00:05:47,433 --> 00:05:48,778
Speaker 0: Why can't it play video?

105
00:05:48,798 --> 00:05:50,505
Speaker 0: There's no reason it can't.

106
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,696
Speaker 0: and In fact, there isn't a reason it can't.

107
00:05:53,816 --> 00:05:59,000
Speaker 0: and today they released a video player for iPod Linux and you can watch video on your iPod nano.

108
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,035
Speaker 0: Fantastic the only pro.

109
00:06:02,055 --> 00:06:09,637
Speaker 0: the reasons is that Apple probably didn't put it out right away were because a the battery life Be not so much hard drive space.

110
00:06:09,758 --> 00:06:13,350
Speaker 0: No see the screen isn't really conducive for video viewing.

111
00:06:13,742 --> 00:06:13,989
Speaker 1: No.

112
00:06:14,371 --> 00:06:22,040
Speaker 0: So if they would have released it as you know market it as this plays video and given it a video feature It would that would have been piss poor.

113
00:06:22,402 --> 00:06:23,829
Speaker 0: that would have looked pretty piss poor.

114
00:06:24,732 --> 00:06:26,807
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I can see why they didn't do it.

115
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:32,525
Speaker 0: But at least these Linux guys got it under control, so if you really want to you're good to go.

116
00:06:32,545 --> 00:06:37,439
Speaker 1: I Don't think I will be anytime soon, but it's cool either.

117
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,010
Speaker 0: But actually I got the new digital camera.

118
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,637
Speaker 0: I got some pictures on the nano.

119
00:06:42,998 --> 00:06:45,107
Speaker 0: It's actually pretty good for showing people pictures.

120
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:47,816
Speaker 0: Ah You know, you think it would be kind of crummy.

121
00:06:47,856 --> 00:06:49,160
Speaker 0: No, it's actually pretty hot.

122
00:06:51,728 --> 00:06:57,926
Speaker 1: So Darwinia Okay, made by the same people who made uplink back in the day.

123
00:06:58,027 --> 00:06:58,790
Speaker 0: Those guys are great.

124
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:02,725
Speaker 1: Yep is gonna be released exclusively through steam.

125
00:07:03,086 --> 00:07:03,970
Speaker 0: Well, at least for Windows.

126
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,642
Speaker 1: Yeah, now you can still just buy the Linux one.

127
00:07:06,682 --> 00:07:08,450
Speaker 1: But if you want the Windows one, you got to get it through steam.

128
00:07:08,973 --> 00:07:15,321
Speaker 0: That's definitely cool because these guys aren't a big-time developer But and they make original games and their games are awesome.

129
00:07:15,662 --> 00:07:16,404
Speaker 0: Really awesome.

130
00:07:16,484 --> 00:07:18,310
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah link was fantastic.

131
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:28,210
Speaker 0: It was crazy good and I played Darwinia and while Darwinia wasn't crazy good It was better than 90% of PC games out there and it was very very original.

132
00:07:29,211 --> 00:07:39,083
Speaker 0: So I think the steam deal is good for them because it gets them a lot more Exposure than they would have gotten say on the shelf in the game store And it's a lot cheaper for them because they don't have to make a box.

133
00:07:39,123 --> 00:07:40,368
Speaker 0: They don't have to make a CD.

134
00:07:41,593 --> 00:07:43,105
Speaker 0: I think it was a very good move on their part.

135
00:07:43,508 --> 00:07:47,609
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean, I have no gripes against steam except for the fact that I can't use in Linux.

136
00:07:48,275 --> 00:07:50,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's pretty much my only problem with steam.

137
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:57,541
Speaker 0: people who have other problems with steam is because they're like Technologically incompetent or they believe something about steam.

138
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,487
Speaker 0: that's not true, which is a lot of people.

139
00:07:59,547 --> 00:08:00,290
Speaker 0: It's kind of scary.

140
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:06,819
Speaker 1: Though if you've never played uplink, I highly recommend you find it and play it.

141
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,657
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's for Linux and Windows and maybe even Mac.

142
00:08:09,677 --> 00:08:10,120
Speaker 0: I'm not sure.

143
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you know in movies how whenever there's a hacker unless it's the matrix for the SSH into something.

144
00:08:16,181 --> 00:08:23,151
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, and you see like the graphics flying by and someone like breaks into a bank and then they're looking through like pictures of People and movie hacking.

145
00:08:23,614 --> 00:08:24,439
Speaker 1: that's what that game is.

146
00:08:24,781 --> 00:08:28,460
Speaker 0: You hack the way they hack in the movies and it feels like the way the game is done.

147
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:34,820
Speaker 0: It feels like you're hacking against other guys that are really out there and you can really get into computers and do stuff.

148
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:37,010
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, there's a computer in the game.

149
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:37,895
Speaker 0: You can get into it.

150
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:38,820
Speaker 1: It's real freeform.

151
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,979
Speaker 1: Like there's one mission where someone tells you to like do something to a bank.

152
00:08:43,342 --> 00:08:44,297
Speaker 1: So you do something to the bank.

153
00:08:44,337 --> 00:08:49,340
Speaker 1: but While I was in the bank I noticed that I could just take a bunch of money out of the bank and put it in another account.

154
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:54,759
Speaker 1: So I did and then a while later that screwed me and the police came and got me.

155
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, mostly because I didn't cover my track so well.

156
00:08:57,591 --> 00:08:58,375
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's very it's.

157
00:08:58,736 --> 00:08:59,640
Speaker 0: it gets pretty difficult.

158
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,780
Speaker 0: There's a lot of fast clicking which is my only problem with the game and there's a kind of a learning curve.

159
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:10,756
Speaker 0: But other than that, it's it's very excellent and it gives you this great feeling like you're in danger all the time.

160
00:09:10,776 --> 00:09:11,177
Speaker 0: I like it.

161
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,605
Speaker 0: Darwinia is more of a You.

162
00:09:15,665 --> 00:09:24,440
Speaker 0: you use mouse gestures to control these little guys To go around a map destroying monsters kind of like Pikmin, but you control it with mouse gestures.

163
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,165
Speaker 0: That's the closest I can come to describing.

164
00:09:26,206 --> 00:09:27,088
Speaker 0: It's really neat looking.

165
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,075
Speaker 1: It's very like 3d vector graphics.

166
00:09:29,576 --> 00:09:30,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's very simple, too.

167
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:36,960
Speaker 0: It's like they're just little green sticky guys But they're 3d and you have cool powers like lightnings and at least that's that I remember.

168
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,196
Speaker 0: It's been a while since I played it.

169
00:09:38,942 --> 00:09:42,600
Speaker 1: It reminds me a little bit of a good version of that old game populace.

170
00:09:43,581 --> 00:09:45,469
Speaker 0: Kind of it's more like a commitment populace.

171
00:09:45,489 --> 00:09:48,139
Speaker 0: Yeah, I kind of kind of it's got aspects of both.

172
00:09:48,941 --> 00:09:49,952
Speaker 0: Definitely a good game.

173
00:09:50,154 --> 00:09:50,538
Speaker 0: It's no mule.

174
00:09:51,743 --> 00:09:52,959
Speaker 0: Yeah, not a mule.

175
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:58,071
Speaker 0: so There was news about the Nintendo revolution today.

176
00:09:58,132 --> 00:09:59,797
Speaker 0: That was actually very specific.

177
00:10:00,178 --> 00:10:00,660
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

178
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,451
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's going to have something called play control.

179
00:10:03,471 --> 00:10:05,540
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I saw that.

180
00:10:05,943 --> 00:10:07,859
Speaker 0: Basically, it's a parental lockout system.

181
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:12,407
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm very much against censorship But I'm fine with things like this.

182
00:10:12,507 --> 00:10:15,841
Speaker 1: because you're allowed to I say you should be allowed to censor your shut yourself as much as you Want.

183
00:10:16,142 --> 00:10:22,032
Speaker 0: yeah, I think this kind of thing is actually really good because a it doesn't keep me from playing any games You know.

184
00:10:22,113 --> 00:10:25,871
Speaker 0: B You can shut people like Jack Thompson up because you know.

185
00:10:25,951 --> 00:10:30,755
Speaker 0: now a parent can do if they if they buy their kid a revolution They could just set it to like.

186
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:33,383
Speaker 0: play No game.

187
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:38,160
Speaker 0: don't play any games that are more than mildly violent and don't play games with any sex or bad words in them.

188
00:10:38,361 --> 00:10:46,571
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then even if the kid borrows a game from a friend or rents one from blockbuster The parent doesn't even have to pay attention to the ESRB ratings anymore.

189
00:10:46,591 --> 00:10:49,300
Speaker 0: It's just done and this is Nintendo.

190
00:10:49,723 --> 00:10:52,260
Speaker 1: There's no way anyone will be able to claim that it's too difficult.

191
00:10:52,461 --> 00:10:56,503
Speaker 1: You know, there's gonna be a big green button that takes care of everything Absolutely.

192
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:59,640
Speaker 0: It's probably that big a button on the easy to use remote control.

193
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:12,269
Speaker 0: even a parent can figure out how to use not a game controller, so that just doubles it right there and Hopefully now this will also Get companies to make you know some more.

194
00:11:13,911 --> 00:11:19,270
Speaker 1: You know mature games for the the revolution because you mean mature as in a good game or mature is in.

195
00:11:19,451 --> 00:11:21,869
Speaker 1: Oh, look, there's lots of blood and gore and adult theme.

196
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,034
Speaker 0: Well, no, no, it's.

197
00:11:23,295 --> 00:11:33,870
Speaker 0: it's the fact that there are a lot of games that people make now where you know Sometimes people make a game like BMX xxx where it's mature just for the sake of being mature to get people to buy it.

198
00:11:34,554 --> 00:11:47,679
Speaker 0: And there are other games that are actually good games but they either give the mature content to add to the selling power because the publisher makes them or They add it's mature because the game is mature.

199
00:11:47,719 --> 00:11:51,270
Speaker 0: It's you know, like Solid Snake is has violence Counter-Strike has violence.

200
00:11:51,331 --> 00:12:00,172
Speaker 0: yeah, how the game is and people I think we're refraining from releasing these games for the GameCube because they had kind of these bad impressions or they or Something.

201
00:12:01,058 --> 00:12:09,089
Speaker 0: and I hope a system like this, you know Helps bring those games around because what can happen is, you know, someone like Jack Thompson might you know?

202
00:12:10,031 --> 00:12:13,486
Speaker 0: Put pressure on these companies and they release games for the Xbox 360 or the ps3.

203
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:18,849
Speaker 0: But if they release them for the revolution, they won't get pressure because this system is in place.

204
00:12:19,351 --> 00:12:25,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it might make them feel better about making revolution games, you know, it's just one more plus plus for the revolution.

205
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:29,442
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean the more not that it needs any more plus yeses.

206
00:12:29,904 --> 00:12:30,546
Speaker 1: I mean pretty much.

207
00:12:30,586 --> 00:12:35,564
Speaker 1: it looks to me, honestly I don't think the PlayStation 3 is going to be much of a contender this time around.

208
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:40,984
Speaker 1: Nope except in Japan Yeah, but in Japan the Xbox isn't selling at all.

209
00:12:41,185 --> 00:12:44,234
Speaker 0: So yeah, yep Pretty much.

210
00:12:44,254 --> 00:12:52,605
Speaker 0: I got the same philosophy at the revolution that I did for the DS And that was I don't know 100% everything about it yet worst-case scenario.

211
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,110
Speaker 1: It's a virtual boys case scenario.

212
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,139
Speaker 0: It's a virtual boy and you know what with the DS.

213
00:12:56,561 --> 00:12:57,787
Speaker 0: it was the best case scenario.

214
00:12:57,847 --> 00:13:03,250
Speaker 1: It's awesome Yeah, so it was awesome and Mario Kart sealed the deal and now it's my primary gaming.

215
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,180
Speaker 0: The deal was sealed before Mario Kart.

216
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,860
Speaker 0: This is like a golden frosting Bonus stage.

217
00:13:10,406 --> 00:13:10,710
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

218
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,645
Speaker 1: So, uh my thing of the day thing of the day.

219
00:13:15,665 --> 00:13:16,147
Speaker 0: Yeah.

220
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:22,345
Speaker 1: All right I assume everyone out there has seen Lupin the third the castle of Cagliostro.

221
00:13:22,606 --> 00:13:23,710
Speaker 0: That's a great freaking anime.

222
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:27,664
Speaker 1: If you haven't go see it, it's probably the best Lupin movie.

223
00:13:28,105 --> 00:13:30,858
Speaker 1: and if you don't know who Lupin is Go see that movie.

224
00:13:31,381 --> 00:13:32,930
Speaker 0: It's one of the best Lupin movies.

225
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:36,581
Speaker 0: There are many great Lupin movies and they are difficult to compare.

226
00:13:36,721 --> 00:13:37,724
Speaker 1: It's my favorite though.

227
00:13:37,744 --> 00:13:39,430
Speaker 1: I really like the Fuma conspiracy.

228
00:13:40,652 --> 00:13:41,742
Speaker 0: Everyone loves that one, too.

229
00:13:41,843 --> 00:13:48,030
Speaker 1: Yeah The only one that I really don't like is Babylon Gold, but I still like it for its MST 3k value.

230
00:13:48,992 --> 00:13:53,270
Speaker 0: It definitely is a high MST 3k value with the motorcycles on clown faces.

231
00:13:53,819 --> 00:14:08,489
Speaker 1: but uh Japan's Princess Sayaka Sayaka got married and her wedding dress was based exactly on the movie that the Female protagonist wore at the end of castle of Cagliostro because she is a huge Miyazaki fan.

232
00:14:09,312 --> 00:14:10,214
Speaker 0: That's pretty awesome.

233
00:14:10,695 --> 00:14:15,227
Speaker 0: It's kind of like that guy who's gonna cosplay his car from Gundam and go into space.

234
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:26,164
Speaker 1: Oh Yeah, you know what this tells you is that the people who grew up with anime in Japan are now getting old, you know There's gonna be a time at which people who played Mario Brothers are gonna run for president.

235
00:14:26,546 --> 00:14:31,349
Speaker 1: Hallelujah It might be the kids who died on the first Guma and gave up.

236
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,295
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got one question about this though.

237
00:14:33,315 --> 00:14:37,648
Speaker 0: It says that when she married a commoner, she's no longer princess, right?

238
00:14:37,729 --> 00:14:42,690
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm wondering who is there that's appropriate to marry?

239
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,600
Speaker 0: That's not a commoner and it's not in her family.

240
00:14:46,263 --> 00:14:47,949
Speaker 0: Is it incest or Scott's the deal?

241
00:14:48,811 --> 00:14:56,135
Speaker 1: You realize that every European Nation back in the day also had to deal with this and They incest.

242
00:14:56,295 --> 00:15:06,096
Speaker 1: you call one you can marry other royal families like if a princess from Japan I don't know if Japan works this way, but like if a princess from France married a princess from a prince Not utana.

243
00:15:06,457 --> 00:15:09,050
Speaker 1: Yeah from say England or Germany.

244
00:15:09,232 --> 00:15:09,699
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that's fine.

245
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:10,409
Speaker 0: That's fine.

246
00:15:10,651 --> 00:15:16,490
Speaker 1: But you know notice how there aren't so many lines of royal blood and notice how a lot of lines of royal blood have issues.

247
00:15:17,152 --> 00:15:19,539
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess cuz there was mad incest.

248
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:25,314
Speaker 0: but apparently like all our sisters have married People who are royal.

249
00:15:25,374 --> 00:15:28,825
Speaker 0: so I'm wondering is there incest still going on or is there something?

250
00:15:28,865 --> 00:15:29,326
Speaker 0: I don't know.

251
00:15:29,988 --> 00:15:32,014
Speaker 1: Um At least in Europe.

252
00:15:32,135 --> 00:15:33,498
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's still incest going on.

253
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:37,650
Speaker 0: among what few noble families are less still they're still incest thing to this day.

254
00:15:38,192 --> 00:15:39,255
Speaker 1: It's not direct incest.

255
00:15:39,315 --> 00:15:40,519
Speaker 1: It's usually like second cousins.

256
00:15:41,362 --> 00:15:42,446
Speaker 0: Oh, that's not so bad.

257
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:44,855
Speaker 1: But well, actually in fact I saw an article on FARC.

258
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:48,730
Speaker 1: It was last year where they proved that first cousins and further.

259
00:15:49,191 --> 00:15:55,810
Speaker 1: There is pretty much zero risk and it really doesn't do anything bad unless you repeat it for dozens of generations.

260
00:15:57,571 --> 00:16:01,060
Speaker 1: So if you're into the it's still not something I support.

261
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,025
Speaker 0: but yeah, no, but I'm still.

262
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:06,074
Speaker 0: I'm just wondering specifically for the Japanese Wait, what do you mean support?

263
00:16:06,555 --> 00:16:07,840
Speaker 1: How could who would you be?

264
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,559
Speaker 1: What an incest advocate standing on the street like Incest.

265
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,269
Speaker 0: try it out.

266
00:16:12,413 --> 00:16:16,502
Speaker 0: Well, no But I'm not gonna go around saying look just the biology.

267
00:16:16,562 --> 00:16:19,190
Speaker 0: the biology does say that doing your cousin doesn't hurt.

268
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:24,548
Speaker 0: But I'm not gonna go around the street saying everyone do your cousin if you really wanted to when you were just holding out Cuz it was incest.

269
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:30,050
Speaker 1: I'm of the mind that other people can do whatever they want as long as it doesn't hurt me or anyone else.

270
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,170
Speaker 0: Yes, they can but I don't want them to find out they can.

271
00:16:37,051 --> 00:16:37,956
Speaker 1: So you got a thing.

272
00:16:37,976 --> 00:16:39,423
Speaker 0: I definitely got a thing.

273
00:16:39,604 --> 00:16:44,149
Speaker 0: so this guy calling himself What did he call himself?

274
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,237
Speaker 0: Ray digerati, that's I guess his screen name.

275
00:16:47,497 --> 00:16:51,890
Speaker 0: He's 34 years old and his occupation IT gigolo.

276
00:16:53,651 --> 00:17:03,189
Speaker 0: Basically what he did is he gave some tech support to this girl he knew right and He was looking at her while he was doing the tech support and he said damn she's hot.

277
00:17:04,132 --> 00:17:08,847
Speaker 0: It would be really nice if I could get paid in sex instead of money for fixing her computer.

278
00:17:09,188 --> 00:17:09,690
Speaker 1: That would work.

279
00:17:10,953 --> 00:17:14,824
Speaker 0: Well, I don't think he did it with her But that was the thought that he had in his mind.

280
00:17:14,884 --> 00:17:19,729
Speaker 0: was that you know It would be great to be paid in sex instead of paid in money for a computer work.

281
00:17:20,653 --> 00:17:25,646
Speaker 0: So he put a thing on Craigslist that said I'll fix your computer for a sexual favor.

282
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,389
Speaker 1: That's fantastic, but isn't it illegal in most states?

283
00:17:32,132 --> 00:17:32,634
Speaker 0: I guess it is.

284
00:17:32,654 --> 00:17:35,584
Speaker 0: that's probably why his eyes are cut out and nose or not in this picture.

285
00:17:36,046 --> 00:17:42,384
Speaker 0: Aha, but Um He's doing it and Girls are liking it.

286
00:17:43,613 --> 00:17:44,316
Speaker 0: there's one story.

287
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:50,619
Speaker 0: it actually says right here that he went to some girl's house to fix her computer and She didn't even wait for him to fix it.

288
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,330
Speaker 0: She just started, you know, giving him head.

289
00:17:54,453 --> 00:17:56,914
Speaker 1: Well, uh Good game for him.

290
00:17:57,716 --> 00:17:58,758
Speaker 0: It's pretty scary though.

291
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:03,308
Speaker 1: Like yeah, I'm really not sure what to say to that.

292
00:18:03,569 --> 00:18:06,739
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean, you have all these nerdy guys.

293
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:09,809
Speaker 0: You can't get any and it was so easy this whole time.

294
00:18:11,353 --> 00:18:12,869
Speaker 1: Well, I gotta say it's not really related.

295
00:18:13,531 --> 00:18:15,717
Speaker 1: It's kind of related but not in it.

296
00:18:15,737 --> 00:18:17,381
Speaker 1: All right, so way back.

297
00:18:17,962 --> 00:18:42,930
Speaker 1: I stayed with my girlfriend in the city for a while and one of her roommates in the dorms had a bunch of horrible computer problems, so I sat down and fixed it and The adulations that I received for like the next two days were immeasurable To the point that she even snuck a little like car Thank you card with some money in it into my bag after thanking me like a thousand times previously.

298
00:18:43,672 --> 00:18:46,290
Speaker 1: So having mad computer skills can make you popular.

299
00:18:46,932 --> 00:18:47,514
Speaker 0: I think it's just.

300
00:18:47,534 --> 00:18:57,050
Speaker 0: the problem is a lot of these nerds hiding their basements don't exhibit their computer skills and they can't talk to A woman long enough to know to get her to let her him into their house to fix the computer.

301
00:18:57,873 --> 00:19:02,469
Speaker 0: And I guess this guy seems like a you know an intelligent normal guy so that you can talk to.

302
00:19:02,589 --> 00:19:07,330
Speaker 0: so It says here that his fee is a an orgasm every two hours is pretty fair.

303
00:19:12,472 --> 00:19:15,022
Speaker 1: I'm glad that IBM does not pay me in orgasms.

304
00:19:15,624 --> 00:19:16,809
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz then I couldn't eat.

305
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:22,288
Speaker 1: Yeah, and also I wonder how I would receive them and from whom?

306
00:19:23,792 --> 00:19:24,781
Speaker 0: Mmm, good question.

307
00:19:25,084 --> 00:19:25,649
Speaker 1: Yeah.

308
00:19:26,671 --> 00:19:33,410
Speaker 1: So to move on to our main bit which still does not have bumper music bump a bump bump a bump anime.

309
00:19:35,057 --> 00:19:42,882
Speaker 1: After having watched the third episode of mushi mushishi Which it is definitely the best show currently on that we have access to.

310
00:19:43,162 --> 00:19:44,826
Speaker 0: definitely the best show on.

311
00:19:45,207 --> 00:19:45,709
Speaker 0: that is new.

312
00:19:46,892 --> 00:19:50,425
Speaker 1: So if you need a show to watch right now watch mushishi, it's actually really good.

313
00:19:50,445 --> 00:19:57,730
Speaker 0: Yeah the third episode I didn't like as much as the first and second now and I can kind of see this continuing trend from the second episode.

314
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:03,420
Speaker 0: It's very similar but It's still very good much better than any other show.

315
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:03,620
Speaker 0: Yep.

316
00:20:03,741 --> 00:20:06,170
Speaker 1: And while there's a trend every episode is very different.

317
00:20:06,512 --> 00:20:07,175
Speaker 0: It's very different.

318
00:20:07,315 --> 00:20:10,048
Speaker 1: So I have a feeling that we'll see many interesting little mushi.

319
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:10,871
Speaker 0: I'm just.

320
00:20:11,112 --> 00:20:16,630
Speaker 0: the one thing that's lacking from the show right now is this large overbearing and plot from episode to episode.

321
00:20:16,992 --> 00:20:18,558
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'm sure that'll come.

322
00:20:18,579 --> 00:20:24,588
Speaker 1: I think it has to do with that River thing though I point out that cowboy bebop had no plot the first time.

323
00:20:24,628 --> 00:20:25,331
Speaker 0: it was well It did it.

324
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,721
Speaker 0: just it had it in the first time.

325
00:20:27,761 --> 00:20:28,162
Speaker 1: It was aired.

326
00:20:28,182 --> 00:20:30,030
Speaker 1: They didn't show any of those plot episodes.

327
00:20:31,071 --> 00:20:33,358
Speaker 1: Well, because they were too violent even in Japan.

328
00:20:33,418 --> 00:20:35,765
Speaker 1: They only showed the episodic ones.

329
00:20:35,825 --> 00:20:37,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they made the episode.

330
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:43,850
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, but there were though it they put the plot in separate episodes instead of having it bear out through all.

331
00:20:44,252 --> 00:20:49,836
Speaker 0: But even in kawaii bebop, it does a little tinge of plot here and there, you know I think there will be there.

332
00:20:49,896 --> 00:20:53,210
Speaker 1: they keep alluding to all the things that the main character has done in the past.

333
00:20:53,314 --> 00:20:58,807
Speaker 0: Yeah I think what you're learning about mushi and that eventually is gonna be a big mushi conflict and that'll be the plot.

334
00:20:58,907 --> 00:21:06,521
Speaker 1: maybe or Maybe we'll get to the point where we know about mushi and we'll be like I will figure out what the what the guys should Do before the guy figures out what to do.

335
00:21:06,864 --> 00:21:07,408
Speaker 0: That'd be pretty cool.

336
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,139
Speaker 0: Maybe this would be a good video game like saw with the mushi.

337
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:12,649
Speaker 1: Ah, I wonder if it is a video game could be.

338
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:14,426
Speaker 1: maybe We'll check that bears looking into.

339
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:20,237
Speaker 1: yeah so, uh Gonkotsuo is Finally being released on DVD.

340
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:21,263
Speaker 1: one DVD is out.

341
00:21:21,303 --> 00:21:22,529
Speaker 1: I think the second one's coming soon.

342
00:21:23,413 --> 00:21:25,280
Speaker 0: I was the only good anime of last season.

343
00:21:25,421 --> 00:21:34,229
Speaker 1: Yeah, Gonkotsuo is based on Alexander Damas is the Count of Monte Cristo Alexandre dumass.

344
00:21:34,249 --> 00:21:41,950
Speaker 1: Yeah Now I Won't really recommend the book because it's long very long.

345
00:21:42,151 --> 00:21:46,590
Speaker 1: But if you like that sort of thing the Count of Monte Cristo is one of my favorite books.

346
00:21:46,711 --> 00:21:54,754
Speaker 1: it's absolutely amazing and My only recommendation that if you decide to read it read the penguin classics Translation.

347
00:21:54,935 --> 00:21:57,850
Speaker 1: it is by far the best translation of that book in my opinion.

348
00:21:58,231 --> 00:22:09,786
Speaker 1: See the only warning really is that Alexandre dumass wrote by the line they paid him per line that he wrote man.

349
00:22:09,806 --> 00:22:13,949
Speaker 0: if people got paid that way today Software would be so crappy.

350
00:22:15,212 --> 00:22:17,543
Speaker 1: Hey, it worked out though because he was very verbose.

351
00:22:17,925 --> 00:22:19,070
Speaker 1: so as a result, it's weird.

352
00:22:19,492 --> 00:22:22,810
Speaker 1: You know most books the action speeds up or slows down or skips bits.

353
00:22:23,391 --> 00:22:27,302
Speaker 1: This book skips nothing and the pace never changes no matter what's going on.

354
00:22:27,383 --> 00:22:36,210
Speaker 1: Everything is always described in the same exacting detail Mm-hmm, and oh, you know, is it crazy detail like too much or it's not too much?

355
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,374
Speaker 1: I mean, I really enjoyed it.

356
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:40,245
Speaker 0: There's a lot of books you read where they just keep detailing something.

357
00:22:40,266 --> 00:22:41,390
Speaker 0: You know, all right, what happens?

358
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:44,420
Speaker 1: It's not Hawthorne, okay, but the action move.

359
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:44,982
Speaker 1: here's the thing.

360
00:22:45,022 --> 00:22:47,150
Speaker 1: the action moves that are very swift pace.

361
00:22:47,753 --> 00:22:53,657
Speaker 1: The only reason it's long is because it covers like 40 years At the same pace pretty much.

362
00:22:53,697 --> 00:22:55,364
Speaker 1: It skips a little bit at one point.

363
00:22:55,746 --> 00:22:56,047
Speaker 0: All right.

364
00:22:56,107 --> 00:23:00,305
Speaker 1: Well, that's still good That now the show is interesting because it doesn't like.

365
00:23:00,325 --> 00:23:01,190
Speaker 1: the book is chronological.

366
00:23:01,772 --> 00:23:09,586
Speaker 1: The show picks up about a quarter of the way through the book and you don't know what's going on And then it reveals things through flashbacks and characters telling stories.

367
00:23:09,686 --> 00:23:21,694
Speaker 0: Well, I think the The anime takes a lot of liberties in order to add more drama and suspense especially if you haven't read the book and to also emphasize the sort of like Anime things.

368
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:29,260
Speaker 0: they kind of drew out anything that could be remotely anime and they probably yeah Like they pulled up Beppo a whole lot.

369
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:35,241
Speaker 0: They pulled up like robots a whole lot and fighting Yeah pulled up vampire stuff a whole lot.

370
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:41,604
Speaker 1: That was only very small in the book Yeah, but part of it is that the book was very verbose and it seems like the show.

371
00:23:41,624 --> 00:23:49,930
Speaker 1: the show is very very Exactingly faithful to the mood and the feeling of the book, but it takes a lot of liberties into the actual events.

372
00:23:50,511 --> 00:23:51,674
Speaker 0: It's also very arty.

373
00:23:52,156 --> 00:23:52,456
Speaker 1: Yes.

374
00:23:52,938 --> 00:23:53,619
Speaker 1: It's very pretty.

375
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,702
Speaker 1: It's it's.

376
00:23:55,464 --> 00:23:59,578
Speaker 0: I mean, you can't really expect anything different from Gonzo I know just let it all hang out.

377
00:24:00,221 --> 00:24:02,230
Speaker 1: I mean, I'd say it's even prettier than the utenna movie.

378
00:24:02,994 --> 00:24:04,280
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, definitely.

379
00:24:04,682 --> 00:24:06,110
Speaker 0: It's fancy CG action.

380
00:24:06,671 --> 00:24:12,610
Speaker 0: I'm sure though if Iko Hara had the same equipment the Gonzo has now the utenna movie would have been looking more like that.

381
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:19,438
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe not as dark like night like color dark You know dark is in mood.

382
00:24:19,539 --> 00:24:20,001
Speaker 0: Who knows

383
00:24:20,462 --> 00:24:38,550
Speaker 1: the one interesting thing because I haven't seen the whole show But I've seen a lot of it and I read the whole book multiple times and in the book I was rooting for the count pretty much the whole time I was on the count side because in the book you see what happened to him to make him the way he is today You see what all those people did to him and why he's getting his revenge.

384
00:24:39,052 --> 00:24:42,288
Speaker 1: So you're with him the whole way and every time he wins you're like, yes go count.

385
00:24:42,871 --> 00:24:48,673
Speaker 1: But in the show you see this count and you're afraid of him and you just see him hurting people and you don't know why You don't like him.

386
00:24:48,995 --> 00:24:54,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I watched a lot more of the show not all of it though And at the beginning I was just cautious.

387
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,596
Speaker 0: I was like that counts up to something.

388
00:24:56,239 --> 00:24:58,470
Speaker 0: and then you saw him doing bad things like are he's a bad guy?

389
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:05,349
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you know, they did something to him But they as far as I watched they weren't a hundred percent clear on what it was.

390
00:25:05,711 --> 00:25:17,150
Speaker 1: I'll put it this way and then eventually you were just like all right This counts a bad guy, but once you real like once you see what they did to him You'll be with him a hundred percent and they all deserve what they get.

391
00:25:17,473 --> 00:25:19,250
Speaker 0: I think it has to do with the vampire in it.

392
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:22,849
Speaker 0: So whenever they try to imply that someone's an evil vampire, you know.

393
00:25:23,171 --> 00:25:25,510
Speaker 0: Then you're not on their side so much anymore.

394
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:32,330
Speaker 1: Interestingly enough the whole vampire angle while it is not referred to as such is very faithful to the book.

395
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:37,064
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can't really elaborate without ruining large swatches of a long book.

396
00:25:37,505 --> 00:25:45,108
Speaker 1: the count the ones the bite One batty batty batty batty to batty batty batty batty.

397
00:25:45,389 --> 00:25:45,710
Speaker 0: All right.

398
00:25:47,472 --> 00:25:48,676
Speaker 0: But the the dub.

399
00:25:48,717 --> 00:25:51,909
Speaker 0: we just watched it for like five minutes blisteringly average.

400
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:55,797
Speaker 0: Definitely it's like the same voice actor isn't the same?

401
00:25:55,877 --> 00:25:58,504
Speaker 0: everything is every other freaking anime.

402
00:25:58,745 --> 00:25:59,808
Speaker 1: It's not terrible.

403
00:26:00,028 --> 00:26:00,690
Speaker 1: It's not good.

404
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,537
Speaker 1: It's not worth watching in the dub.

405
00:26:02,819 --> 00:26:08,890
Speaker 1: No, I mean they got a good voice for the count, though It sounds like they did a lot of DSP to make his voice sound deeper and more menacing.

406
00:26:09,672 --> 00:26:12,010
Speaker 0: Well, at least they knew to make it deeper and more menacing.

407
00:26:12,322 --> 00:26:23,930
Speaker 1: Yeah And I got to admit while I don't like the voice actor who does Albert it Just because Albert in the count of Monte Cristo is the most naive character ever to grace anime ever.

408
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:26,349
Speaker 0: That's definitely well translated in the show.

409
00:26:27,471 --> 00:26:32,710
Speaker 0: So, oh my god, like they should just call him, you know, the count day naivety.

410
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:33,513
Speaker 1: so picture this.

411
00:26:33,573 --> 00:26:35,179
Speaker 1: you're like sitting in a room with all your friends.

412
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,749
Speaker 1: and then the lights go out and there's a flash of lightning.

413
00:26:37,769 --> 00:26:42,310
Speaker 1: and Then this evil blue looking count with like blue skin and he's wearing all black.

414
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:47,750
Speaker 1: He's carrying all these implements of various destruction and he walks in and he has a deep evil voice and he looks evil.

415
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:52,754
Speaker 1: He's glaring around and his reflection doesn't show up in the mirror and all your friends are like, whoa That's a bad dude.

416
00:26:52,774 --> 00:26:54,982
Speaker 1: Stay away from him and you're and you look at him.

417
00:26:55,003 --> 00:26:56,850
Speaker 1: You're like, hey, this guy's awesome.

418
00:26:57,131 --> 00:26:58,116
Speaker 1: Don't rag on that guy.

419
00:26:58,136 --> 00:26:58,860
Speaker 1: Let's be friends.

420
00:26:59,261 --> 00:27:00,166
Speaker 1: Come come to my house.

421
00:27:00,206 --> 00:27:00,970
Speaker 1: You're welcome anywhere.

422
00:27:03,191 --> 00:27:08,928
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know when that guy comes into the house to steal all your stuff and he says I'm stealing all your stuff and he points a gun at you.

423
00:27:10,391 --> 00:27:13,845
Speaker 0: Hang out play some cards eat some food make yourself at home.

424
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:15,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, take my TV.

425
00:27:19,072 --> 00:27:20,020
Speaker 0: So on was it?

426
00:27:20,061 --> 00:27:28,701
Speaker 1: Saturday Sunday We watch a place promised finally the place promised in our early days done by the same guy who did a Hoshi no Koi Or voices from a distant star.

427
00:27:28,882 --> 00:27:29,869
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's a good guy.

428
00:27:30,654 --> 00:27:32,889
Speaker 1: It was fantastic and I got to admit I can't write.

429
00:27:33,391 --> 00:27:39,999
Speaker 1: It's hard to talk about it without ruining it because the plot goes in the direction that you did not expect we could talk about it in a meta fashion.

430
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:41,023
Speaker 1: we can the.

431
00:27:41,506 --> 00:27:46,389
Speaker 1: the show starts and it starts in like the present time and then it goes to a flashback.

432
00:27:46,409 --> 00:27:52,310
Speaker 1: and You you just you're sure that something tragic happened to make the present time in the show exist.

433
00:27:52,852 --> 00:27:55,162
Speaker 1: But then you're in this flashback and you're just waiting for it.

434
00:27:55,825 --> 00:27:57,050
Speaker 1: You see all these happy kids together.

435
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,749
Speaker 1: You're just waiting for something horrible to happen.

436
00:27:59,412 --> 00:28:08,318
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the thing is is it's like in a tragedy like Romeo and Juliet, you know, okay It's tragic and you know what the tragedy is, you know It's just when and such.

437
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:11,530
Speaker 0: but this one is not only when but you have no idea what the tragedy is.

438
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,878
Speaker 0: You're just constantly anticipating tragedy.

439
00:28:14,139 --> 00:28:17,470
Speaker 0: In fact, there's one keep happening that might end up tragically.

440
00:28:17,731 --> 00:28:21,163
Speaker 1: There's one scene where they hang it over your head and something happens and someone's in danger.

441
00:28:21,524 --> 00:28:22,146
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

442
00:28:22,447 --> 00:28:23,210
Speaker 1: That's what happened.

443
00:28:23,672 --> 00:28:24,779
Speaker 1: Oh, and then it doesn't happen.

444
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,470
Speaker 0: You're like, oh that wasn't the tragedy.

445
00:28:26,631 --> 00:28:28,200
Speaker 0: I think out on the tragedy.

446
00:28:28,341 --> 00:28:32,939
Speaker 0: this movie fakes out a lot Yeah, but it's definitely the style is easiest.

447
00:28:33,281 --> 00:28:36,672
Speaker 0: It's so if you seen Hoshi no Koi, it's like oh, it's obvious Lee.

448
00:28:36,732 --> 00:28:40,590
Speaker 0: so similar, I mean scenes on empty trains with light shining through.

449
00:28:40,811 --> 00:28:45,607
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know people sitting around and quietness with big landscapes.

450
00:28:45,788 --> 00:28:47,972
Speaker 1: It's very atmospheric It's.

451
00:28:48,112 --> 00:28:52,290
Speaker 0: it's exactly the same way that Hoshi no Koi was like just dead.

452
00:28:52,932 --> 00:29:00,735
Speaker 1: You didn't change his style at all though in terms I think in terms of telling a story and the way it was put together I think he's come very far.

453
00:29:00,755 --> 00:29:14,190
Speaker 0: I like the story of Hoshi no Koi more But this one is more well developed and because it's a whole movie where Hoshi no Koi was a little tiny UAV true But I like those, you know Koi story because it's you know space with a robot and such.

454
00:29:14,991 --> 00:29:16,095
Speaker 0: But this one was all it was.

455
00:29:16,155 --> 00:29:18,644
Speaker 0: this one was also very very cool with the big tower.

456
00:29:18,985 --> 00:29:33,206
Speaker 1: Oh Yeah, and I gotta say once again not to spoil anything but There is a scene and it was probably the saddest scene I've ever seen wherein no one died and nothing bad happened yet.

457
00:29:33,246 --> 00:29:34,049
Speaker 1: I was still sad.

458
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:37,921
Speaker 0: Yeah It makes you sad the whole time.

459
00:29:37,982 --> 00:29:39,070
Speaker 0: It's just how this guy works.

460
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:43,810
Speaker 0: I wonder if the guy who makes it is like a depressed guy or if he just really likes depressing things.

461
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:50,196
Speaker 1: But I gotta say I was very pleased with it because while a lot of people in this movie are depressed They're depressed for good reasons.

462
00:29:50,236 --> 00:29:51,179
Speaker 1: They're not just angsty.

463
00:29:51,199 --> 00:29:53,407
Speaker 1: They have a really damn good reason to be depressed.

464
00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:55,636
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, that's always good.

465
00:29:56,037 --> 00:29:57,584
Speaker 1: You know, it's not like some people we know.

466
00:29:58,045 --> 00:30:04,474
Speaker 0: Yeah some people But if you haven't seen Hoshino Koi or Place Promise see them both.

467
00:30:04,915 --> 00:30:05,818
Speaker 0: Yes, they're on DVD.

468
00:30:05,918 --> 00:30:06,740
Speaker 0: They're awesome.

469
00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:10,170
Speaker 1: Like really awesome, especially considering the story of this guy.

470
00:30:11,013 --> 00:30:15,190
Speaker 1: He pretty much made a Hoshino Koi in his basement in his spare time.

471
00:30:15,531 --> 00:30:20,875
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it was pretty rough and him and him and his wife did the voice acting because it only has two characters and then A studio.

472
00:30:20,895 --> 00:30:21,644
Speaker 1: what studio was it?

473
00:30:21,665 --> 00:30:22,049
Speaker 1: Do you remember?

474
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:28,150
Speaker 0: I don't know but they helped him out and then he made it really professional with real voice actors and they tell the animation again

475
00:30:28,431 --> 00:30:34,133
Speaker 1: Like they picked him up and they redid everything and they showed like they helped him do it the right way and it was Amazingly popular.

476
00:30:34,173 --> 00:30:39,110
Speaker 0: It's like if you did a really bad song, but you recorded it with like a tiny tape recorder.

477
00:30:39,752 --> 00:30:44,310
Speaker 0: But they they noticed your talent and they just realized you were poor and you couldn't do any better.

478
00:30:44,631 --> 00:30:49,877
Speaker 0: And then they brought you to a studio and gave you brand new instruments and a whole band and backup singers And then you did it for real.

479
00:30:50,681 --> 00:30:51,426
Speaker 0: That's what this is like.

480
00:30:51,688 --> 00:30:55,902
Speaker 1: Yeah So I'm actually really looking forward to see what this guy does next.

481
00:30:56,665 --> 00:31:00,234
Speaker 0: Oh, I don't know if he's doing anything next Looking out every day.

482
00:31:00,254 --> 00:31:05,151
Speaker 1: I have a feeling that he's the kind of person who won't do something unless he thinks it's going to be Good.

483
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:09,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, the question is how much money did plays promised make versus how much it cost to produce?

484
00:31:10,276 --> 00:31:11,709
Speaker 1: I don't think it cost that much to produce.

485
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:21,150
Speaker 0: I don't think it cost that much either because doesn't have a whole lot of characters And a lot of the animation is made on computers pretty cheaply, you know, and it's pretty much made by one guy.

486
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,317
Speaker 0: I got a look at the credits again.

487
00:31:22,337 --> 00:31:25,415
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have to see I Wish I knew the guy's name.

488
00:31:25,435 --> 00:31:28,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, I forget and I don't have it handy right now.

489
00:31:28,392 --> 00:31:38,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, there'll be a link on the page But meanwhile, alright We don't even know what the next place promised movie is gonna be or the next thing from this guy is gonna be.

490
00:31:39,192 --> 00:31:41,161
Speaker 0: But the Fullmetal Alchemist movie is out.

491
00:31:41,282 --> 00:31:43,009
Speaker 0: It has been out and we still haven't seen it.

492
00:31:43,271 --> 00:31:46,063
Speaker 1: Ah, I saw the end of that show last year.

493
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:52,063
Speaker 0: It was the last Super amazing show that everyone liked and everyone was desperate to see the next episode.

494
00:31:52,364 --> 00:31:59,216
Speaker 1: unlike most anime like this the movie isn't a stupid recap movie or a Recap with a little bit of new footage.

495
00:31:59,316 --> 00:32:00,882
Speaker 1: It's just the plot continues.

496
00:32:01,183 --> 00:32:03,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, no stupid summary movies here.

497
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:10,134
Speaker 0: it's just new whole new thing with the same characters and everyone wants to see the movie and It's been in theaters.

498
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:10,796
Speaker 0: It's good.

499
00:32:10,836 --> 00:32:13,966
Speaker 0: I think it's on DVD now and we still can't download it.

500
00:32:13,986 --> 00:32:14,828
Speaker 0: We still can't buy it.

501
00:32:14,969 --> 00:32:15,390
Speaker 0: What gives?

502
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:20,101
Speaker 1: Yeah, some fan subbers do your illegal business and give us our medicine.

503
00:32:20,823 --> 00:32:24,115
Speaker 0: or hey company do your legal business and freaking just put The thing out.

504
00:32:24,498 --> 00:32:37,138
Speaker 1: Yeah, I want to see in the theater and Because it's been so long anyway and my flame to see it has died out a little bit I think I could hold out until they actually show it in the theater because I've seen like every major anime movie in the theater Lately since we live next to New York City.

505
00:32:37,419 --> 00:32:38,183
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

506
00:32:38,203 --> 00:32:39,710
Speaker 0: I actually wouldn't mind watching the show again.

507
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,817
Speaker 0: I should probably buy all the DVDs when they're in one box.

508
00:32:41,977 --> 00:32:43,582
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, if you buy that I'll buy Gonkatsu.

509
00:32:43,602 --> 00:32:44,385
Speaker 0: Oh, awesome.

510
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:46,977
Speaker 0: I Think you were gonna buy Gonkatsu.

511
00:32:47,017 --> 00:32:47,782
Speaker 0: Oh anyway, I am.

512
00:32:47,802 --> 00:32:48,930
Speaker 1: you're gonna buy FMA anyway.

513
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:59,835
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if anyone knows what the story with the FMA movie is and why it's no one's been able to see it Yeah, and if anyone gets us the movie somehow We'll treat you somehow.

514
00:33:00,036 --> 00:33:01,300
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean friggin.

515
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,508
Speaker 0: I heard that the Japanese DVD is gonna have English subtitles But then wouldn't there be a Chinese bootleg today?

516
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,801
Speaker 1: If it actually has English subtitles, we could just buy it.

517
00:33:10,103 --> 00:33:11,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, we could just buy it from Japan.

518
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,075
Speaker 0: I don't see why not.

519
00:33:12,176 --> 00:33:12,458
Speaker 0: Of course.

520
00:33:12,518 --> 00:33:14,109
Speaker 1: Our DVD player isn't region-free anymore.

521
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,297
Speaker 0: Well, my computer is.

522
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,086
Speaker 1: yeah, my computer kinda is.

523
00:33:18,106 --> 00:33:20,900
Speaker 1: yeah My DVD ROM is so old.

524
00:33:20,961 --> 00:33:23,633
Speaker 1: It can't play dual layer discs Awesome.

525
00:33:24,355 --> 00:33:34,083
Speaker 1: So since we ran out of anime and manga to talk about it's the meta bits And we still need bumper music for all of our internal bits.

526
00:33:34,685 --> 00:33:37,897
Speaker 0: Yeah, I emailed Macanized supremacy today.

527
00:33:37,917 --> 00:33:45,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, and in all their awesomeness they said yeah sure You can use our music for whatever as long as you give us credit and don't profit bad ass.

528
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:48,509
Speaker 0: So, I don't know if their music really fits.

529
00:33:49,172 --> 00:33:56,129
Speaker 1: I love Macanized supremacy, but I don't want to be a show that Takes just their favorite band and uses it as their music.

530
00:33:57,011 --> 00:34:06,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know if you know, it doesn't really fit with the music we have now But we could just use all their music and then our show would kind of change feeling which I don't know.

531
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,234
Speaker 0: I feel about that.

532
00:34:07,294 --> 00:34:08,822
Speaker 1: Yeah, I kind of like the feeling as it is.

533
00:34:08,842 --> 00:34:12,780
Speaker 1: I want to find some like old Licensed royalty-free big band music.

534
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know what kind of feeling other people have though.

535
00:34:16,071 --> 00:34:17,757
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know what kind of feeling I have.

536
00:34:17,797 --> 00:34:19,061
Speaker 0: I don't know a feeling other people have.

537
00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:28,130
Speaker 1: well to get the one bit of feedback I ever got about the music from a cute friend of ours and the quote was your opener is pure sex.

538
00:34:29,591 --> 00:34:30,474
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's pretty good.

539
00:34:30,494 --> 00:34:32,621
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we're one for one.

Speaker 1: No, so DJ pretzel if you're listening, uh, thanks.

542
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,344

00:34:39,525 --> 00:34:44,304
Speaker 1: No, I've emailed him twice and Give him credit every day in the closing bit.

544
00:34:44,485 --> 00:34:47,155
Speaker 0: So yeah I'm sure he won't mind.

545
00:34:47,215 --> 00:34:50,790
Speaker 0: I mean, I've heard radio shows using those ear you nixes.

546
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,670
Speaker 0: I don't know if they got permission and I've heard.

547
00:34:53,911 --> 00:34:56,159
Speaker 0: You know, oh, this is an OC remix podcast.

548
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, and his songs are freely downloadable on the internet.

549
00:34:58,751 --> 00:35:01,041
Speaker 0: Anyway, well close out like I looked at his website.

550
00:35:01,062 --> 00:35:01,966
Speaker 1: He seems like a cool dude.

551
00:35:02,106 --> 00:35:04,053
Speaker 0: He's very cool, dude There's no question about it.

552
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:09,027
Speaker 1: I've been looking through his music to look for other music I could use for other bumpers.

553
00:35:09,549 --> 00:35:14,430
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah Also, we're still having trouble figuring out what to do with Monday.

554
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:20,106
Speaker 1: Yeah, because once again, it's hard to talk about gadgets because then it's just an informative.

555
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:21,330
Speaker 1: Hey this gadget exists.

556
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:23,399
Speaker 1: Hey this guy's gadget exists and you know what.

557
00:35:24,001 --> 00:35:25,930
Speaker 1: and gadget exists and you don't need us for that.

558
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:35,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean we could talk about the merits of different things like, you know Oh Google came out with this new program and then we could talk about the program.

559
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:35,953
Speaker 0: But it's mo it.

560
00:35:36,194 --> 00:35:37,520
Speaker 0: well, there's a little bit of opinion.

561
00:35:37,561 --> 00:35:38,605
Speaker 0: Like I think it'll be useful.

562
00:35:38,645 --> 00:35:39,610
Speaker 0: I think it won't be useful.

563
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:40,895
Speaker 0: I think it'll have this effect.

564
00:35:41,678 --> 00:35:42,982
Speaker 0: It doesn't last very long at all.

565
00:35:43,404 --> 00:35:49,956
Speaker 0: No answers are obvious and uninteresting Unless we go all you know stupid.

566
00:35:50,097 --> 00:35:58,709
Speaker 1: and we wanted to talk about sci-fi, but we've all already read the sci-fi classics and There's not much news on that front.

567
00:35:59,053 --> 00:36:00,047
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I try.

568
00:36:00,107 --> 00:36:00,430
Speaker 0: you know I'm.

569
00:36:00,751 --> 00:36:03,681
Speaker 0: I try to say I'm a well-rounded geek and I like all the geekeries.

570
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:06,110
Speaker 0: but sci-fi really not so much as the others.

571
00:36:06,351 --> 00:36:06,713
Speaker 1: See me.

572
00:36:06,754 --> 00:36:07,196
Speaker 1: I like it.

573
00:36:07,277 --> 00:36:09,290
Speaker 1: I'm currently reading through a lot of the old classics.

574
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:10,714
Speaker 1: I've missed that.

575
00:36:10,734 --> 00:36:11,356
Speaker 0: I've already read.

576
00:36:11,376 --> 00:36:13,081
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I just picked up the difference engine.

577
00:36:13,101 --> 00:36:13,823
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

578
00:36:14,124 --> 00:36:15,046

00:36:15,307 --> 00:36:16,250
Speaker 0: It's pretty badass.

580
00:36:18,113 --> 00:36:21,880
Speaker 0: So if anyone you know Knows what they want to hear on Monday we could.

581
00:36:22,122 --> 00:36:23,870
Speaker 0: where you know, we're still experimenting.

582
00:36:24,011 --> 00:36:25,677

584
00:36:28,548 --> 00:36:35,585
Speaker 1: I mean Yeah, make it like role-playing Gamer type day, but you do you really want to hear us talk about our characters?

585
00:36:36,248 --> 00:36:40,089
Speaker 0: or you know If we played more board games, you could do like session report type things.

586
00:36:40,371 --> 00:36:43,891
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's already board game podcasts that are better than ours like.

587
00:36:43,931 --> 00:36:51,567
Speaker 1: that's the reason we don't play geeky or 8-bit music and talk about it because there's a million million shows about music and You guys don't need another one.

588
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:59,709
Speaker 0: Yeah, and there's already weekly shows that talk about all the big tech news with guys who are you know much bigger than we are.

589
00:37:00,695 --> 00:37:08,144
Speaker 1: So well, not physically No, physically in popularity and radio skill unless they got some.

00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,705
Speaker 0: It's very rare that I find a new comic.

00:37:17,766 --> 00:37:18,207
Speaker 1: It's the new.

598
00:37:18,247 --> 00:37:24,854

Speaker 0: Yeah, it's the last new first new comic.

600
00:37:27,523 --> 00:37:28,667
Speaker 0: I've added in like forever.

601
00:37:28,807 --> 00:37:32,304
Speaker 0: I can't even remember Yep, and the one before that was ordered at the stick.

602
00:37:33,047 --> 00:37:36,820
Speaker 0: oops We didn't update yet today at least as far as I saw.

603
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,406
Speaker 0: I have to go check again.

604
00:37:38,446 --> 00:37:42,208
Speaker 0: Yeah These penny arcade is updating more reliably now with their new website.

605
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:45,950
Speaker 1: Yeah I really wanted to go to their child's play charity dinner, but it's on the west coast.

606
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:51,530
Speaker 0: They seem to really neglect the East Coast even though they know that most of the readers are on the East.

607
00:37:51,571 --> 00:37:52,488
Speaker 1: Send some love out here.

608
00:37:52,892 --> 00:37:56,470
Speaker 0: I know and seriously like you have an event on the West Coast like two or three times.

609
00:37:56,570 --> 00:38:00,450
Speaker 0: Eventually people kind of like, you know get slightly less excited about it.

610
00:38:00,832 --> 00:38:03,309
Speaker 0: If you put it on the East Coast, it'll renew the vigor.

611
00:38:03,891 --> 00:38:09,048
Speaker 1: Don't think that the Baltimore comic-con was a representation of the East Coast interest in penny arcade.

612
00:38:09,429 --> 00:38:15,358
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean they went to the Baltimore comic-con and it was in Baltimore Which is one reason people didn't go.

613
00:38:15,378 --> 00:38:18,230
Speaker 0: the second reason people didn't go is that it was a comic-con which?

614
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:20,969
Speaker 0: Isn't huge on penny arcade fans?

615
00:38:21,211 --> 00:38:31,248
Speaker 0: I mean sure you're a comic and you think of yourself as fitting in with the comics crew but really The video game people and the anime people are what it's all about.

616
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:33,883
Speaker 0: Yeah Those are the people who love your comic the most.

617
00:38:33,924 --> 00:38:34,829
Speaker 0: that are the crazy thing

618
00:38:36,712 --> 00:38:41,129
Speaker 1: Of course since you're obviously listening to geek nights and you'll respond to this

619
00:38:41,391 --> 00:38:46,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz if they're listening to geek nights, we would totally be hosed when we got wang,

620
00:38:47,581 --> 00:39:01,241
Speaker 1: you know what it'd be like when we were at Otacon and An entertainment system this little NES type band play a little concert and Me and a friend of ours named Conrad a bunch of our friends.

621
00:39:01,302 --> 00:39:02,426
Speaker 1: We're doing crazy dances.

622
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:09,090
Speaker 1: Like they played a slow song I held up my freaking DS with the screen on which is something you learned from reading what Tycho said about the concert.

623
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:11,785
Speaker 1: it passed yeah, but no one saw that here in the East Coast.

624
00:39:12,569 --> 00:39:15,340
Speaker 0: or Talking about how penny arcade is mad popular in the East Coast.

625
00:39:15,401 --> 00:39:16,003
Speaker 0: They should come here.

626
00:39:16,023 --> 00:39:17,268
Speaker 1: That's something like that.

627
00:39:18,446 --> 00:39:22,433
Speaker 1: So We did like Tetris dance.

628
00:39:22,473 --> 00:39:23,396
Speaker 1: we did a bunch of cool dances.

629
00:39:23,436 --> 00:39:25,705
Speaker 0: So whatever we also stole from the internet.

630
00:39:25,926 --> 00:39:34,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then later We were going to watch a movie at the con and we ran into the lead singer of the band and he runs over.

631
00:39:34,631 --> 00:39:36,357
Speaker 1: He's like you two guys.

632
00:39:36,578 --> 00:39:38,264
Speaker 1: You're those cool guys from the crowd.

633
00:39:38,305 --> 00:39:49,410
Speaker 1: We looked we're like, holy crap You're that cool guy from the band and it was two groups of people who each thought that the other group of people was really Cool and that was a weird interaction that I never experienced before.

634
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:52,004
Speaker 1: I've never been a fan of someone who was a fan of me.

635
00:39:52,527 --> 00:39:53,130
Speaker 0: It's really hard.

636
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:58,270
Speaker 0: I mean usually, you know, we're we know we're a group of cool people, you know, and we kind of do cool stuff.

637
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:03,850
Speaker 0: But we usually find other groups, but it's usually like a person or maybe to a couple.

638
00:40:04,292 --> 00:40:06,163
Speaker 0: We never find a whole other group.

639
00:40:06,204 --> 00:40:07,189
Speaker 0: That is totally cool.

640
00:40:07,771 --> 00:40:09,697
Speaker 0: You might find a whole nother group with a cool guy in it.

641
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:11,262
Speaker 0: You never find another cool.

642
00:40:11,322 --> 00:40:13,810
Speaker 0: Totally a hundred percent cool other group.

643
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:14,694
Speaker 0: They're super rare.

644
00:40:14,834 --> 00:40:15,276
Speaker 1: It's tough.

645
00:40:15,417 --> 00:40:18,329
Speaker 0: Well, you know, the penny arcade has one and we want them to bring it this way.

646
00:40:18,732 --> 00:40:24,682
Speaker 0: Yep, because we need more cool groups out here on the East Coast Eventually, we can get all the cool groups and make the order of the cool groups.

647
00:40:25,244 --> 00:40:25,545
Speaker 1: Yeah.

648
00:40:25,605 --> 00:40:30,730
Speaker 1: Yeah cool group coalition We could turn it into some sort of Skinner colony the front row crew.

649
00:40:32,313 --> 00:40:36,136
Speaker 1: front row crew crew You know what the more.

650
00:40:36,176 --> 00:40:42,010
Speaker 1: I think we should just turn Monday into general geekery and stories, but but Thursday's is whatever.

651
00:40:42,331 --> 00:40:43,456
Speaker 1: Thursday is free-for-all.

652
00:40:43,717 --> 00:40:45,144
Speaker 1: So Monday is general geekery.

653
00:40:45,244 --> 00:40:46,630
Speaker 1: Then Thursday's are like interview days.

654
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:49,423
Speaker 0: So then on Thursday, are we gonna make it so we can't talk about geekery?

655
00:40:49,463 --> 00:40:49,523
Speaker 0: on?

656
00:40:49,563 --> 00:40:56,805
Speaker 1: Thursday has to be all non geekery Not non geekery, but like one thing like Monday is a potpourri and Thursday is a like.

657
00:40:57,306 --> 00:40:59,454
Speaker 1: actually I lined up some Interviews.

658
00:40:59,755 --> 00:41:03,696
Speaker 1: as soon as we can get around to going to where these people are We got a bunch of interviews we can do.

659
00:41:03,857 --> 00:41:06,650
Speaker 0: maybe I can try to set up that evil Skype to do an interview.

660
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:10,486
Speaker 1: Yeah, though a lot of the people we can interview now actually live places we can go.

661
00:41:10,507 --> 00:41:13,192
Speaker 0: That's good Yeah.

662
00:41:13,272 --> 00:41:18,658
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not mentioning any of their names yet cuz we don't know when we're gonna actually get around to this But I got some cool people lined up.

663
00:41:18,819 --> 00:41:20,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think we need to work on our interviewing skills.

664
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:22,867
Speaker 0: It never really you ever interviewed someone.

665
00:41:22,968 --> 00:41:25,356
Speaker 1: actually I've interviewed a lot of people.

666
00:41:25,497 --> 00:41:31,356
Speaker 1: I wrote for the school newspaper all through middle school in high school and We did a not a radio show.

667
00:41:31,436 --> 00:41:35,890
Speaker 1: but uh, like the morning announcements talk show in school in high school.

668
00:41:36,251 --> 00:41:37,897
Speaker 1: So I've interviewed a lot of people actually.

669
00:41:38,359 --> 00:41:38,840
Speaker 0: Yeah.

670
00:41:39,101 --> 00:41:45,386
Speaker 1: I also took classes on how to interview people at RIT Since while I'm an IT geek and I got my degree in IT.

671
00:41:45,406 --> 00:41:47,956
Speaker 1: I Had a lot of free time at RIT.

672
00:41:47,976 --> 00:41:51,810
Speaker 1: I took every class in the professional technical communications major.

673
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:56,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know how to interview someone like if I want to hire them or not or to find out about them.

674
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,356
Speaker 0: But I don't know how to interview them.

675
00:41:57,397 --> 00:41:59,970
Speaker 0: like to make them say enter and do entertaining things.

676
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:01,718
Speaker 1: See it depends on what we're who we're interviewing.

677
00:42:01,798 --> 00:42:09,750
Speaker 1: Like if we interview James Randi or someone Like someone informative or someone we wanted to learn about it would definitely be a question and answer.

678
00:42:10,112 --> 00:42:12,189
Speaker 1: We would like to know this and he tells us about this.

679
00:42:13,252 --> 00:42:16,249
Speaker 1: We asked them for what they want us to tell us things like that an informative interview.

680
00:42:16,892 --> 00:42:26,889
Speaker 1: but if we interview like some cool gamer dude, we happen to know or it's like someone who writes a cool webcomic and Everyone already knows the details about him Then we'll just try to be funny and hang out and talk about whatever.

681
00:42:27,331 --> 00:42:30,503
Speaker 0: Try to get them to say funny things like their webcomic is yeah.

682
00:42:30,724 --> 00:42:32,169
Speaker 1: Yeah, which is hit or miss.

683
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:38,990
Speaker 1: Some webcomic artists are exactly like you'd think they are and some are the exact opposite of like you'd think they are.

684
00:42:40,271 --> 00:42:41,275
Speaker 0: That's generally how it is.

685
00:42:41,556 --> 00:42:44,287
Speaker 1: Yeah, some things are like some things and some things are like other things.

686
00:42:44,367 --> 00:42:44,949
Speaker 1: how insightful.

687
00:42:46,937 --> 00:42:56,782
