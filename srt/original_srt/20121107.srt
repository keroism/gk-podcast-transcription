9
00:00:37,874 --> 00:00:39,219
Speaker 0: Maybe more so.

10
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:45,958

11
00:00:46,385 --> 00:00:52,349
Speaker 0: Okay I also because I did not get breakfast bought a banana And I put the banana in my pocket.

12
00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:54,477
Speaker 1: because how much do they sell a banana for at Starbucks?

13
00:00:54,537 --> 00:00:55,180
Speaker 0: like a dollar.

14
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:56,869
Speaker 1: Why don't you buy one from the street guy?

15
00:00:56,889 --> 00:00:57,934
Speaker 1: Who's like 50 cent or 25 cent?

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,913
Speaker 0: There's no street guy open when I get to my office anywhere near my office.

17
00:01:03,134 --> 00:01:04,599
Speaker 1: You can get fruits all near my office.

18
00:01:05,182 --> 00:01:06,287
Speaker 0: Also, I don't have to walk anywhere.

19
00:01:06,328 --> 00:01:08,116
Speaker 0: this subway stops like right there, but anyway.

20
00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:08,860
Speaker 0: I bought a banana.

21
00:01:09,432 --> 00:01:12,367
Speaker 1: Okay Overpriced Starbucks banana.

22
00:01:12,467 --> 00:01:14,980
Speaker 0: my hands are full so I put it in my pocket of my leather jacket.

23
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:16,997
Speaker 0: I went into work, and I forgot I had the banana.

24
00:01:17,017 --> 00:01:23,220
Speaker 0: I Realized today, I'm sitting at work, and I'm like wait a minute didn't I buy a banana?

25
00:01:24,504 --> 00:01:25,513
Speaker 0: And I reach in my pocket.

26
00:01:25,573 --> 00:01:26,158
Speaker 0: It's not there.

27
00:01:27,244 --> 00:01:29,974
Speaker 1: Are you sure you didn't drop the banana out the pocket.

28
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:31,340
Speaker 0: if you look at those pockets?

29
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:38,220
Speaker 0: There's a flap and they're really deep there's and there was also a moleskine and my wallet in the same pocket.

30
00:01:38,782 --> 00:01:41,735
Speaker 1: I start you sure you didn't eat the banana and forgot you ate the banana.

31
00:01:42,037 --> 00:01:44,687
Speaker 0: I'm Food is very important to me in my life.

32
00:01:44,788 --> 00:01:50,958
Speaker 0: the odds of me forgetting that I ate anything pretty low Are you sure?

33
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,390
Speaker 1: that you were like?

34
00:01:52,431 --> 00:01:59,620
Speaker 1: you know you Like did you look when you put the banana in the pocket or just sort of feel you put the banana pot because you might Have felt like you put the bit in the pocket back?

35
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,791
Speaker 1: She's dropping it on the ground.

36
00:02:00,811 --> 00:02:02,824
Speaker 0: so I've done that before With other things.

37
00:02:02,884 --> 00:02:07,360
Speaker 0: in fact I had a pair of jeans where the left pocket if you put anything in it immediately fell into my pant.

38
00:02:08,321 --> 00:02:17,791
Speaker 0: So uh no I am sure because not only did I lift the flap and like put it in and then think uh-oh What if I crushed this banana against my moleskine?

39
00:02:18,212 --> 00:02:18,935
Speaker 0: Oh, don't worry.

40
00:02:18,955 --> 00:02:20,460
Speaker 0: I won't forget the bananas there.

41
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:24,017
Speaker 1: Are you sure you didn't do some sort of you know?

42
00:02:25,701 --> 00:02:29,220
Speaker 1: Move to avert that situation and forgot the move you made.

43
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,733
Speaker 0: There's only so many pockets in the and I went back to.

44
00:02:32,793 --> 00:02:37,039
Speaker 0: so basically I had this moment of There is a banana on the loose.

45
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,620
Speaker 0: That is a dangerous situation.

46
00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:42,268
Speaker 0: So I checked every pocket no banana.

47
00:02:43,011 --> 00:02:44,396
Speaker 0: I looked around my desk at work.

48
00:02:44,477 --> 00:02:45,139
Speaker 0: No banana.

49
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:49,012
Speaker 0: I Went into the closet at work and looked around no banana.

50
00:02:49,414 --> 00:02:50,840
Speaker 0: I didn't see a banana at any point.

51
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:52,820
Speaker 1: So now you're a pickpocket of the banana.

52
00:02:53,364 --> 00:03:01,380
Speaker 0: I thought about that, but my wallet was in the same pocket And I still really shitty pickpocket or really hungry, so there's a banana on the loose.

53
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:06,207
Speaker 0: So I implore you geek nights listeners if any of you find my banana I would like you to let me

54
00:03:06,247 --> 00:03:07,051
Speaker 1: know it's in your pants

55
00:03:07,433 --> 00:03:13,757
Speaker 0: because if you find my banana It means that you are a goddamn stalker, and I really need to know your name, so I can tell the police

56
00:03:14,178 --> 00:03:14,540
Speaker 1: also.

57
00:03:15,882 --> 00:03:17,292
Speaker 1: You can find the banana easily.

58
00:03:17,352 --> 00:03:18,359
Speaker 1: just look for the fruit flies.

59
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,085
Speaker 0: Also, that's what I want to avoid.

60
00:03:21,105 --> 00:03:26,399
Speaker 0: I don't want to find fruit flies because then I will find the banana also bit too late.

61
00:03:27,721 --> 00:03:36,719
Speaker 0: banana banana banana God dang I don't think anyone who listens to the show will understand what you were referred to.

62
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:41,260
Speaker 1: fine I think everyone was banana waiting in fact.

63
00:03:42,362 --> 00:03:46,819
Speaker 0: Then until this second at least one listener thought you were very poorly referencing that.

64
00:03:48,782 --> 00:03:50,490
Speaker 0: Nope so it's Wednesday now.

65
00:03:50,611 --> 00:03:51,515
Speaker 0: What do you got for me?

66
00:03:52,118 --> 00:03:52,319
Speaker 1: so?

67
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,796
Speaker 1: The other day we were discussing what to do the show on about.

68
00:03:57,936 --> 00:04:00,726
Speaker 1: today now It's a Monday night.

69
00:04:00,927 --> 00:04:03,700
Speaker 1: after the Monday show we're like what should we do on the Wednesday?

70
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,478
Speaker 0: And I was like well Scott you had me reread Gotham Central, so let's do the show on.

71
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:08,867
Speaker 1: well you I had you read it.

72
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,720
Speaker 1: I was supposed to reread it.

73
00:04:10,861 --> 00:04:13,072
Speaker 0: I had read the first one before but I didn't read the rest.

74
00:04:13,113 --> 00:04:17,019
Speaker 1: for some I have not Reread it so we cannot do a show.

75
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,750
Speaker 0: I can't in any way blame you because I've been the person causing the.

76
00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:23,440
Speaker 0: oh, I didn't read it yet it more times.

77
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:26,188
Speaker 1: Also, I'm playing ns2 you can't you know?

78
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,260
Speaker 0: yeah, so we were like alright, let's do what we did before.

79
00:04:29,341 --> 00:04:38,010
Speaker 0: Let's get some anime and watch it and rather than rely Just like we did on the last Wednesday episode about one piece rather than rely on the you know Bit torrent or wait a minute.

80
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,740
Speaker 0: Are you sure this thing's only an hour long?

81
00:04:40,701 --> 00:04:47,236
Speaker 0: We I have a bunch of DVDs like a nice high kick silent service great elf princess rain.

82
00:04:48,242 --> 00:04:50,748
Speaker 1: So new rim suggests some tenchi muyo av.

83
00:04:50,788 --> 00:04:51,751
Speaker 1: so I don't know.

84
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:54,378
Speaker 0: no no I suggested the tenchi muyo movies.

85
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:59,219
Speaker 0: now the problem is Tenchi muyo movie number one actually really good.

86
00:05:00,187 --> 00:05:06,239
Speaker 0: Not an hour long Tenchi movie - actually an hour long involves incest.

87
00:05:07,581 --> 00:05:10,271
Speaker 0: Okay, so we had to pick something else.

88
00:05:10,472 --> 00:05:12,520
Speaker 0: so we talked about tension el hazard situation.

89
00:05:12,601 --> 00:05:14,960
Speaker 1: But isn't that the same guy so Scott suggested?

90
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,410
Speaker 1: Maybe jokingly because he was already suggesting all these tenchi things.

91
00:05:18,931 --> 00:05:27,157
Speaker 1: I jokingly suggested tenchi muyo gxp Which if you don't know if we have talked about it in the distant past terrible.

92
00:05:27,518 --> 00:05:28,060
Speaker 1: It's awful.

93
00:05:28,181 --> 00:05:31,193
Speaker 1: We watched this in anime club when it was brand fucking new.

94
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:32,720
Speaker 1: we watched like four episodes.

95
00:05:32,861 --> 00:05:33,866
Speaker 1: I think I only watch one.

96
00:05:34,087 --> 00:05:36,760
Speaker 0: I walked out after the first episode because I was.

97
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:43,260
Speaker 1: That point is the worst show with the best opening song of any show ever like that.

98
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,676
Speaker 1: I'm not saying it has the best opening song of any way ever.

99
00:05:46,997 --> 00:05:53,075
Speaker 1: I'm saying The goodness of the opening song compared to the shittiness of the show is the largest gap.

100
00:05:53,376 --> 00:05:59,380
Speaker 0: now to put that into perspective Dot hack sign and noir have really good opening songs.

101
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,369
Speaker 0: They do pretty bad shows.

102
00:06:01,972 --> 00:06:03,860
Speaker 0: the disparity here is greater.

103
00:06:04,061 --> 00:06:07,695
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically because the primarily because of how bad you know the opening song bow time.

104
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,357
Speaker 1: It's like the opening song is pretty good.

105
00:06:10,397 --> 00:06:16,825
Speaker 0: like I Love that song so much.

106
00:06:16,905 --> 00:06:21,327
Speaker 1: It's a good song, but the show is so Shitty.

107
00:06:21,408 --> 00:06:26,374
Speaker 1: seriously, I'm talking worse Photon bad definitely ready how to smack your mama.

108
00:06:26,394 --> 00:06:27,480
Speaker 0: so here's the deal.

109
00:06:27,882 --> 00:06:31,280
Speaker 0: It's bad right, but it's bad in like this extra way.

110
00:06:31,441 --> 00:06:39,113
Speaker 0: So if you haven't seen any other tenchi muyo, and you watch this It's just this terrible fucking anime if you have seen tenchi muyo.

111
00:06:39,173 --> 00:06:44,420
Speaker 0: It's even worse because you're watching thinking alright It's tenchi, so it must take place in the tenchi universe.

112
00:06:44,962 --> 00:06:50,125
Speaker 0: I think once like one of the real tenchi characters flies by in the background And you're like.

113
00:06:50,145 --> 00:06:52,799
Speaker 0: that is literally the best thing that's happened in this show.

114
00:06:53,655 --> 00:06:58,716
Speaker 0: so My surprise god is this better or worse than photon in your?

115
00:06:58,777 --> 00:07:01,150
Speaker 1: I didn't see photon So I went to.

116
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,699
Speaker 1: I've only seen photon on the TV.

117
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:09,340
Speaker 0: What is worse watch an episode of photon and an episode of tenchi muyo.

118
00:07:09,923 --> 00:07:11,853
Speaker 1: Even have episodes isn't it just one disc.

119
00:07:11,913 --> 00:07:13,180
Speaker 1: I've only ever seen one disc.

120
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:16,200
Speaker 0: I've only ever seen the trailer and I knew better.

121
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:17,304
Speaker 1: I saw an immediate plate.

122
00:07:17,324 --> 00:07:19,131
Speaker 1: was one disc photons below that line.

123
00:07:19,171 --> 00:07:30,391
Speaker 0: like I always say the second worst movie ever made is Well the worst movie ever made is Clifford with Martin short playing a ten-year-old boy Because below that there are worse movies that I knew better than to watch.

124
00:07:30,953 --> 00:07:32,177
Speaker 0: I knew better than to watch.

125
00:07:32,197 --> 00:07:34,829
Speaker 1: so tenchi muyo Gxp imagine my surprise.

126
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:52,320
Speaker 1: I go to look for news for this show You know in this morning, and I noticed that on November 3rd this year only four days before this recording Cartoon Network has announced they're gonna have tenchi muyo Gxp added to their adult swim lineup.

127
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,845

Speaker 1: Here's the adult swim schedule midnight.

139
00:08:17,693 --> 00:08:23,120

140
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:32,774
Speaker 1: Because that's the fucking lineup and the only shows in there that are halfway good or being 26 episodes and they're rotating through them a hundred times because that lineup isn't right after school.

141
00:08:33,256 --> 00:08:33,977

00:08:33,998 --> 00:08:34,840

00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:09,679
Speaker 1: Or maybe you're just most people with a really early job and you watch it like in the morning when you wake up.

153
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:17,083
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if you're up and awake and have a half hour to kill watching an entire episode of anime Something's going.

154
00:09:17,143 --> 00:09:21,360
Speaker 1: maybe you wake up and eat your breakfast like at 4 30 with the second coffee above episode.

155
00:09:21,462 --> 00:09:27,120
Speaker 0: I'll be not bad Time to go to watching cowboy bebop again, that wouldn't be so bad.

156
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:34,480
Speaker 0: So if you're up at 3 in the morning and you're watching Fullmetal Alchemist brotherhood, it's an up all night party.

157
00:09:34,701 --> 00:09:37,610
Speaker 0: I actually haven't seen Eureka seven and Thundercats is shit.

158
00:09:37,691 --> 00:09:38,253
Speaker 1: I find it funny.

159
00:09:38,273 --> 00:09:39,176
Speaker 1: They have samurai seven.

160
00:09:39,196 --> 00:09:40,460
Speaker 1: Wait a minute Thundercats.

161
00:09:40,601 --> 00:09:42,088
Speaker 1: Well, wait, is this the new Thundercats?

162
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:44,500
Speaker 0: or do you really think it's the old Thundercats?

163
00:09:45,381 --> 00:09:47,600
Speaker 1: Do you really think that I thought it was the old one?

164
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,765
Speaker 0: Okay, the new Thundercats looks great.

165
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:54,500
Speaker 0: If you watch the new Thundercats with no sound and no sub the titles.

166
00:09:54,881 --> 00:09:55,543
Speaker 0: It's pretty great.

167
00:09:55,563 --> 00:09:57,911
Speaker 1: But anyway, they have samurai seven and Eureka seven.

168
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,659
Speaker 1: They need to add in blue sub.

169
00:10:04,134 --> 00:10:06,666
Speaker 1: Anyway Do you have any sort of news?

170
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:15,840
Speaker 0: So since we brought up tenchi muyo, you know tenchi muyo It's interesting how when I was like are like a huge fan of anime.

171
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,218
Speaker 0: I mean, I've been a fan of anime since in the 90s since I was in fourth grade in the 90s.

172
00:10:21,182 --> 00:10:23,813
Speaker 1: Yeah, when I'm she muyo was a big deal in the u.s.

173
00:10:23,954 --> 00:10:25,460
Speaker 1: I don't know how big a deal it was in Japan.

174
00:10:25,601 --> 00:10:27,528
Speaker 1: I assume it was at least a moderate deal when I.

175
00:10:27,548 --> 00:10:34,560
Speaker 0: but that's based on when I was nothing when I was in fourth grade And I saw a vampire hundred because my mom forced me to I became a huge fan of anime.

176
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:45,080
Speaker 0: But when I got involved in anime culture Which did not happen until long after that because they're really I saw anime before I had access to the internet.

177
00:10:45,942 --> 00:10:56,040
Speaker 0: So when I finally got on the internet and discovered there was this whole anime culture and like anime conventions and all this bullshit Tenchi muyo among anime fans was the biggest goddamn thing ever.

178
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,820
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, here's how it went, right?

179
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:02,240
Speaker 1: So you could watch Sailor Moon and stuff like that and syndicated local TV.

180
00:11:02,481 --> 00:11:04,388
Speaker 1: But once you got Cartoon Network, you could drop.

181
00:11:04,448 --> 00:11:05,010
Speaker 0: now that out.

182
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:07,620
Speaker 0: you could drop 40 bucks to get one.

183
00:11:07,821 --> 00:11:09,708
Speaker 0: I was subtitled VHS tape.

184
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:19,999
Speaker 1: I was attention with two episodes Whose video went to the local comic shop and they had the tiny shelf that had like 20 VHS tapes on it.

185
00:11:19,999 --> 00:11:23,033
Speaker 1: 18 of them were on my half and two of them were tension.

186
00:11:23,053 --> 00:11:25,448
Speaker 1: We know no no No, there was also.

187
00:11:25,548 --> 00:11:26,899
Speaker 1: three of them were Dragon Ball Z.

188
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,159
Speaker 0: Now if you were a little little more connected you go to Suncoast video and they had slayers.

189
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,625
Speaker 1: We didn't have one of those they had.

190
00:11:32,646 --> 00:11:36,180
Speaker 0: so they had subtitled anime, which you guys might not remember back then.

191
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,213
Speaker 0: Subtitled anime cost an extra ten to fifteen dollars.

192
00:11:40,253 --> 00:11:41,900
Speaker 1: But anyway, those are the three shows tension.

193
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,803
Speaker 1: It was one of them.

194
00:11:42,843 --> 00:11:45,412
Speaker 1: So of course it was big at the time.

195
00:11:45,573 --> 00:11:47,560
Speaker 1: In fact, you know how it's pretty much disappeared.

196
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,829
Speaker 1: Can you even remember seeing a tenchi cosplayer at any convention recently?

197
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:51,570
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

198
00:11:51,651 --> 00:11:53,656
Speaker 0: No, but yet I remember no to con 2002.

199
00:11:53,656 --> 00:12:01,601
Speaker 0: I Saw a girl who was dressed up as Ryoko and I thought she was super cute and I didn't flirt with her and I don't remember Why.

200
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:04,312
Speaker 0: okay, and back then they were all my age.

201
00:12:04,412 --> 00:12:05,255
Speaker 0: It wasn't like now.

202
00:12:05,355 --> 00:12:06,560
Speaker 1: so continue with your news.

203
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:08,072
Speaker 0: Oh, my news is a geek bite.

204
00:12:08,454 --> 00:12:09,180
Speaker 1: Oh, it's not a news.

205
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:14,320
Speaker 0: You are a no more recent fan of anime and you'd like there's harem shows.

206
00:12:14,621 --> 00:12:17,172
Speaker 0: Actually, I don't think anyone even really remembers love Hina anymore.

207
00:12:17,192 --> 00:12:18,356
Speaker 1: I remember it existed.

208
00:12:18,377 --> 00:12:19,059
Speaker 1: I watched the whole thing.

209
00:12:19,904 --> 00:12:21,332
Speaker 0: I know I didn't cuz I knew better.

210
00:12:21,352 --> 00:12:22,660
Speaker 1: cute turtles is the only good part.

211
00:12:23,082 --> 00:12:25,034
Speaker 0: Yeah, everybody gets one harem show.

212
00:12:25,054 --> 00:12:27,247
Speaker 1: if you're gonna watch it You know why I watch that show.

213
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,459
Speaker 1: because I was home from RIT.

214
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:34,136
Speaker 1: My internet was 56k dial-up modem got everybody already downloaded all of it.

215
00:12:34,176 --> 00:12:39,540
Speaker 1: while I was at RIT I already watched everything that I had already downloaded and I'm sitting at home in the summer sort of in between.

216
00:12:39,701 --> 00:12:43,255
Speaker 0: So when it comes to anime everybody doesn't just get one of a different genre.

217
00:12:43,275 --> 00:12:44,380
Speaker 0: You have a Yahtzee sheet.

218
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:56,360
Speaker 0: You've got like harem show But independently of that you've got the show you watch when you don't have internet Which I guess can't happen anymore and all you've got is something on a hard drive.

219
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:57,765
Speaker 0: That's right.

220
00:12:57,785 --> 00:13:00,074
Speaker 0: My show like that was read or die TV.

221
00:13:00,435 --> 00:13:03,006
Speaker 0: I watched all of read or die TV Living in the woods.

222
00:13:03,127 --> 00:13:04,071
Speaker 0: I didn't have internet.

223
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:05,076
Speaker 0: I was living on the mountain.

224
00:13:05,096 --> 00:13:05,980
Speaker 1: So you did read or die TV.

225
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:06,859
Speaker 1: I did love Hina TV.

226
00:13:07,341 --> 00:13:11,695
Speaker 0: So love Hina fills for you either your harem show or your.

227
00:13:11,755 --> 00:13:13,420
Speaker 0: there is nothing else to do show.

228
00:13:14,306 --> 00:13:18,188
Speaker 1: I think I've seen some other harem shows So I'll put that is our thing else to do.

229
00:13:18,309 --> 00:13:19,152
Speaker 0: so his art.

230
00:13:19,172 --> 00:13:20,940
Speaker 1: does that count as a harem show?

231
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,970
Speaker 0: All right, but it's also a robot show kind of.

232
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,134
Speaker 1: well, how about Maha to kaita?

233
00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:25,957
Speaker 1: Is that a harem show?

234
00:13:26,359 --> 00:13:32,540
Speaker 0: No That is a. that is a wacky anime 90s comedy in my opinion.

235
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:43,336
Speaker 0: Anyway, so if you're gonna watch a harem show You should watch tenchi muyo, but it's hard to watch tenchi muyo because there's no AV.

236
00:13:43,637 --> 00:13:44,740
Speaker 0: That's actually really good.

237
00:13:45,221 --> 00:13:46,425
Speaker 0: There's another OAV.

238
00:13:46,465 --> 00:13:48,150
Speaker 0: That's a sequel to that not as good.

239
00:13:48,451 --> 00:13:49,755
Speaker 0: There's another OAV.

240
00:13:49,815 --> 00:13:50,617
Speaker 0: That's garbage.

241
00:13:50,858 --> 00:13:51,560
Speaker 0: There's a TV show.

242
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,605
Speaker 0: That's garbage a TV show.

243
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,751
Speaker 0: There's more garbage TV show.

244
00:13:53,771 --> 00:13:55,440
Speaker 0: That's even more garbage a TV show.

245
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,598
Speaker 0: You shouldn't watch and then tension.

246
00:13:57,638 --> 00:13:59,285
Speaker 1: wait So they use this.

247
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:03,160
Speaker 1: that there were four TV series is each one was more garbage than the last.

248
00:14:03,681 --> 00:14:07,612
Speaker 0: Everyone is worse, but so hey, but only the fourth one.

249
00:14:07,652 --> 00:14:08,394
Speaker 1: you shouldn't watch.

250
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,580
Speaker 1: so you should watch the first three garbage ones.

251
00:14:11,962 --> 00:14:17,039
Speaker 0: It's kind of like how if you like initial D, okay watch season one You're done.

252
00:14:17,622 --> 00:14:20,331
Speaker 0: If you're a goddamn maniac you watch the rest of it.

253
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:23,964
Speaker 0: if you watch the tension if you get into tension You're gonna watch it all.

254
00:14:24,506 --> 00:14:27,820
Speaker 0: I'm gonna give you all some advice stop before tenchi in Tokyo.

255
00:14:27,921 --> 00:14:28,867
Speaker 0: You might think the rim.

256
00:14:29,109 --> 00:14:29,793
Speaker 0: I really like it.

257
00:14:29,894 --> 00:14:36,900
Speaker 0: should know no Do not watch tenchi in Tokyo if you like, but they like those three which were garbage.

258
00:14:38,547 --> 00:14:41,123
Speaker 1: They like garbage shouldn't they like?

259
00:14:41,204 --> 00:14:52,120
Speaker 0: in my opinion that tenchi consists of the first movie and the first OAV and everything else is Literally just trying to reclaim nostalgia for those first two things.

260
00:14:53,083 --> 00:15:06,399
Speaker 0: So if you haven't seen a harem show haven't seen these kind of 90s II anime And you don't know where to start you want to know something about tenchi which which was Somewhat moderately important during a time period in American anime history.

261
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:11,367
Speaker 0: in fact I would say that this is one of those anime You should see if you call yourself an anime fan.

262
00:15:11,427 --> 00:15:15,880
Speaker 0: You should watch the tenchi muyo movie tenchi in love.

263
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:20,660
Speaker 0: It is the first movie just 90 minutes long well animated big budget.

264
00:15:21,163 --> 00:15:22,268
Speaker 0: It's a good movie.

265
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:27,220
Speaker 0: there aren't that many anime movies Especially ones that break the formula.

266
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:32,636
Speaker 0: This is a movie for a show that has its own continuity affects the plot kills people.

267
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:33,700
Speaker 0: It's good.

268
00:15:34,803 --> 00:15:37,020
Speaker 0: So watch that that is my geek bite.

269
00:15:37,141 --> 00:15:38,266
Speaker 0: I don't want to say anything else.

270
00:15:38,507 --> 00:15:48,200
Speaker 0: you don't need to know anything about tenchi because I Watched the tenchi movie on the sci-fi channel and all I could think was why the hell can that one girl fly?

271
00:15:48,761 --> 00:15:49,844
Speaker 0: Does she have a tail?

272
00:15:49,864 --> 00:15:52,691
Speaker 0: and I couldn't quite tell if she had a tail or not.

273
00:15:52,731 --> 00:15:54,094
Speaker 0: I was really fascinated by this.

274
00:15:54,115 --> 00:15:59,764
Speaker 1: I Don't need to say anything to that Time.

275
00:15:59,804 --> 00:16:10,650
Speaker 0: you understand 1992 or 93 but anyway things of the day.

276
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,510
Speaker 0: What do you got for me Scott?

277
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:16,330
Speaker 1: I went through my youtube likes and I found the first thing that I thought would be okay.

278
00:16:16,752 --> 00:16:18,543
Speaker 1: And it's been a little dry recently.

279
00:16:18,563 --> 00:16:19,548
Speaker 1: so here we go.

280
00:16:20,292 --> 00:16:23,145
Speaker 1: Girl football player is fast and fun to watch.

281
00:16:23,326 --> 00:16:24,110
Speaker 1: it is some girl.

282
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:40,090
Speaker 1: she looks like she's in elementary middle school age, maybe late elementary early middle and she plays peewee football in whatever her town is and She totally kicks ass and gets like 35 fucking touchdowns and the video is like all fast forwarded.

283
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,798
Speaker 1: So it looks like everyone's running really fast.

284
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:48,087
Speaker 1: They're obviously running slower than that, but She's fast anyway because no one can fucking catch her right.

285
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:52,090
Speaker 1: she gets the ball She runs all the way down the field like a pro, and it's pretty awesome.

286
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,583
Speaker 1: You know I mean I've never seen peewee football.

287
00:16:55,644 --> 00:16:58,476
Speaker 1: anyone this good At peewee football.

288
00:16:58,556 --> 00:17:06,109
Speaker 1: usually peewee football is like a bunch of kids Move a ball and then fall on each other in a big heap and then someone like you know peels them off each other.

289
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,214
Speaker 1: and It's just like there.

290
00:17:07,275 --> 00:17:17,808
Speaker 1: it might as well be vibrating table football right whereas You know this because this girl is in play and she seems to actually know what the fuck is going on and B She's able to run really fast.

291
00:17:18,892 --> 00:17:22,430
Speaker 1: It actually turns into something resembling real football, and it's cool.

292
00:17:23,193 --> 00:17:28,010
Speaker 0: So we talked about we didn't go to the New York comic-con because there's basically nothing to see there.

293
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:33,664
Speaker 1: Anymore no no reason to physically go especially to spend money and time to go there.

294
00:17:33,704 --> 00:17:44,077
Speaker 0: the last thing that most people have you know If you discount all the things that aren't there anymore it comes like this the one thing you can go there for is to see Stuff that no one else has seen before.

295
00:17:44,358 --> 00:17:52,630
Speaker 0: that's being announced and is brand new like if you're waiting for a new show to come Out you'll see like the highlights review preview.

296
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:57,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, they do this at San Diego comic-con and also at New York comic-con like oh my god.

297
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,850
Speaker 0: Here's six minutes of the new My Little Pony episode.

298
00:18:00,795 --> 00:18:01,942
Speaker 1: Pretty much the only two places.

299
00:18:01,982 --> 00:18:03,350
Speaker 1: They do it is they'll be like all right.

300
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,769
Speaker 1: We've got a new movie coming out.

301
00:18:05,171 --> 00:18:12,362
Speaker 1: You're the first people in the whole world to see this ten minute clip from this movie That's coming out or this trailer for this movie.

302
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,116
Speaker 1: We literally just announced 30 seconds ago You're the first people in the world this.

303
00:18:15,156 --> 00:18:17,590
Speaker 0: so yeah, guess what if you wait like an hour?

304
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,075
Speaker 0: Someone on YouTube?

305
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:20,987
Speaker 1: someone had a fan cam and put it on YouTube.

306
00:18:21,288 --> 00:18:26,450
Speaker 0: so I'm a fan of venture brothers, and I become more and more of a fan as time has gone on.

307
00:18:27,431 --> 00:18:28,316
Speaker 0: It's a great show.

308
00:18:28,477 --> 00:18:33,849
Speaker 0: It's actually one of my favorite cartoon TV shows There's been in recent memory if you were a fan of it.

309
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:37,110
Speaker 0: You're waiting for season 5. not only is it coming which we've known for a while.

310
00:18:37,751 --> 00:18:44,890
Speaker 0: There is a sizzle reel from New York comic-con 2012 five minutes and 17 seconds of spoilers.

311
00:18:45,653 --> 00:18:52,607
Speaker 1: Something I've learned from sizzle reels is that when you see them You don't need to see the show because it's pretty much all the good parts right and it comes.

312
00:18:52,627 --> 00:18:55,900
Speaker 0: ah But a properly done sizzle reel and this one does it well.

313
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:58,570
Speaker 0: if you watch this and you've never seen venture brothers.

314
00:18:59,277 --> 00:19:00,570
Speaker 0: It makes no goddamn sense.

315
00:19:01,092 --> 00:19:13,764
Speaker 0: Pay attention to certain things happen and people react to them very differently like a dude Shows up in a butterfly costume and people are like yeah, and then some other dude shows up in a similar costume And the crowds like oh my god.

316
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,861
Speaker 0: But this one does a very good job of.

317
00:19:17,941 --> 00:19:24,283
Speaker 0: if you've seen venture brothers It's just everything you see is a really oh my god.

318
00:19:24,323 --> 00:19:25,526
Speaker 0: I got to know what that's all about.

319
00:19:25,586 --> 00:19:26,429
Speaker 0: moment mm-hmm.

320
00:19:27,011 --> 00:19:30,265
Speaker 1: Yeah, usually what happens is it's like the guys who make trailers.

321
00:19:30,305 --> 00:19:31,430
Speaker 1: They're always torn right.

322
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,890
Speaker 1: It's like they don't want to put give everything away in the trailer.

323
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:39,894
Speaker 1: They know that but the problem is okay, so we won't put the best good stuff in the trailer We'll put the medium stuff.

324
00:19:39,914 --> 00:19:44,550
Speaker 1: so now the trailer isn't so good because you want like especially if it's a comedy, right?

325
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,618
Speaker 1: It's like what do you want me to do?

326
00:19:45,658 --> 00:19:47,290
Speaker 1: put the unfunny jokes in the trailer?

327
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:50,710
Speaker 1: No, you get about the funny jokes in there so that people think the movies gonna be funny.

328
00:19:51,072 --> 00:19:58,415
Speaker 1: And then of course they see the trailer they hear all the funny jokes They watch the movie and the only times they laugh are the same jokes that were in the trailer They've already heard.

329
00:19:58,435 --> 00:19:59,381
Speaker 1: and then the movies.

330
00:19:59,421 --> 00:20:00,770
Speaker 1: not funny because those are the only funny.

331
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:07,934
Speaker 0: So the proper way to do a sizzle reel is to show things that are tantalizing Especially in this case.

332
00:20:07,954 --> 00:20:10,221
Speaker 0: you know it's a show that already had four seasons.

333
00:20:10,482 --> 00:20:13,752
Speaker 0: the only people watching this sizzle reel are people who have seen them.

334
00:20:14,334 --> 00:20:18,569
Speaker 0: show them just enough stuff to hint at the kinds of things that will happen.

335
00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:24,170
Speaker 0: and The crazy plot points like oh my god so and so is still alive and some bullshit's gonna happen.

336
00:20:24,452 --> 00:20:26,768
Speaker 0: or why is that guy a centaur now?

337
00:20:26,788 --> 00:20:31,885
Speaker 0: and And Don't actually give enough context to figure out what actually happened?

338
00:20:31,925 --> 00:20:34,153
Speaker 0: don't show an entire scene Mmm-hmm.

339
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:36,685
Speaker 0: so just show the basically fanboy fodder.

340
00:20:36,705 --> 00:20:38,693
Speaker 1: all right That's things of the day.

341
00:20:38,733 --> 00:20:39,576
Speaker 1: meta moment time.

342
00:20:39,616 --> 00:20:44,190
Speaker 0: the book club book is the name of the wind by Patrick Roth.

343
00:20:46,316 --> 00:20:47,586
Speaker 0: You know what pretty good book?

344
00:20:47,606 --> 00:20:48,938
Speaker 0: uh Read it.

345
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:49,590
Speaker 1: It's a book club.

346
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,413
Speaker 0: I'm gonna lock.

347
00:20:50,433 --> 00:20:56,143
Speaker 0: glamour is better, but you should read it because I read it and I started reading the second book Which is the already yeah?

348
00:20:58,012 --> 00:20:58,797
Speaker 0: But I haven't started reading.

349
00:20:58,817 --> 00:21:00,244
Speaker 0: I was on the subway for like an hour.

350
00:21:00,264 --> 00:21:01,048
Speaker 0: I had to do something.

351
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:02,674
Speaker 0: okay I already listen to Dave and Joel.

352
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:04,601
Speaker 1: what other meta moments.

353
00:21:04,621 --> 00:21:05,143
Speaker 1: Do we have?

354
00:21:05,203 --> 00:21:05,805

Speaker 0: We're going to be doing beyond the Candyland.

358
00:21:13,454 --> 00:21:15,325

00:22:24,154 --> 00:22:24,737
Speaker 0: You stopped.

377
00:22:25,401 --> 00:22:26,990
Speaker 1: that's all we needed up the trail.

378
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:31,650
Speaker 1: So did you know that there's a Super Nintendo game based on this called UN squadron?

379
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:34,760
Speaker 0: Actually, I heard there's a Super Nintendo game based on this called UN squad.

380
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,449
Speaker 1: really did you know the Super Nintendo game based on this?

381
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,260
Speaker 1: Anime and manga called UN squadron.

382
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,570
Speaker 0: So more importantly there's this movie called snatch.

383
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:45,730
Speaker 0: I don't know if you've ever seen it, but it's an inside joke.

384
00:22:46,292 --> 00:22:49,016
Speaker 0: Oh So here's some context.

385
00:22:49,699 --> 00:22:54,421
Speaker 1: back in the day, you know back in the day Monday We needed to figure out what to do a show on.

386
00:22:54,482 --> 00:22:55,507
Speaker 1: we couldn't come up with anything.

387
00:22:55,527 --> 00:22:57,810
Speaker 1: today We're like we need to watch an anime real quick.

388
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:01,185
Speaker 1: The only DVD we had that had an anime that was only an hour long.

389
00:23:01,226 --> 00:23:02,210
Speaker 1: is it this way two hours?

390
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:05,830
Speaker 1: I was was area 88 so we watched it and now we're doing a show on it.

391
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:08,628
Speaker 0: I want to do a little more context cuz I have seen this before whoa.

392
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:19,695
Speaker 0: So when I knew of it before when I was eight and a half years old And my little brother was Six years old.

393
00:23:19,715 --> 00:23:26,675
Speaker 0: Okay, my parents forced me and my little brother to watch vampire hunter D Eyeball it mouth.

394
00:23:26,735 --> 00:23:29,447
Speaker 0: I was born in 1982 so you can figure out when that was so.

395
00:23:30,953 --> 00:23:53,870
Speaker 0: Not too long after that as in about five minutes after that I was a hardcore anime fan and I went to blockbuster video which existed back then wasn't full of ghosts And I proceeded to rent every single anime that was on the shelf there Except for neon Genesis Evangelion because as a little kid, I thought it was some Christian anime.

396
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,294
Speaker 0: I didn't want to see anything like that.

397
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:56,598
Speaker 0: Good job an atheist.

398
00:23:56,658 --> 00:23:57,320
Speaker 1: Good job.

399
00:23:57,501 --> 00:23:58,363
Speaker 0: Only I'd known.

400
00:23:58,504 --> 00:23:59,005
Speaker 1: good job.

401
00:23:59,065 --> 00:23:59,988
Speaker 0: I swear to God.

402
00:24:00,008 --> 00:24:00,269
Speaker 1: good job.

403
00:24:01,852 --> 00:24:10,515
Speaker 1: So when I went to the RIT anime club I looked at the VHS tapes they had there and even jelly was the one that had the nicest boxes and had a name and Felt like it was.

404
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:12,284
Speaker 1: I just saw these crosses.

405
00:24:12,344 --> 00:24:13,370
Speaker 0: It was called Evangelion.

406
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:18,710
Speaker 0: That was the first one I went for of a wimpy kid like sitting in a chair crying and someone's talking to him.

407
00:24:19,151 --> 00:24:20,476
Speaker 0: I knew what that was gonna be about.

408
00:24:20,496 --> 00:24:21,339
Speaker 1: sure you did.

409
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:37,544
Speaker 0: So after I'd already watched like Armageddon and I don't know wind of amnesia and we named me not even demon demon city There project a co all that business wicked sitting.

410
00:24:38,066 --> 00:24:39,089
Speaker 0: I hadn't seen wicked city.

411
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:48,049
Speaker 0: yet I saw a wicked city later, but still probably Dragon pink and dragon half.

412
00:24:48,834 --> 00:24:55,244
Speaker 0: some point in that sojourn I rented a VHS tape that simply said area 88 the blue skies of betrayal.

413
00:24:55,585 --> 00:24:58,359
Speaker 0: and when I looked at that box I remember thinking wait a minute.

414
00:24:58,922 --> 00:25:00,550
Speaker 0: That looks a lot like UN squadron.

415
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,922
Speaker 0: This is UN squadron, why the fuck is this called area?

416
00:25:06,003 --> 00:25:07,850
Speaker 1: I don't know if we can emphasize enough.

417
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,678
Speaker 1: This thing is fucking UN squadron.

418
00:25:09,719 --> 00:25:12,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was a big fan of UN squadron.

419
00:25:12,492 --> 00:25:14,584
Speaker 1: It's actually a fucking good game, but fuck it.

420
00:25:14,645 --> 00:25:18,120
Speaker 0: It's a really good shmup But it's hard as ball like the weather outside.

421
00:25:18,201 --> 00:25:19,907
Speaker 0: I get like the wind rimer that it is.

422
00:25:19,968 --> 00:25:20,510
Speaker 1: That's right.

423
00:25:20,911 --> 00:25:22,015
Speaker 1: So as it fucks.

424
00:25:22,496 --> 00:25:34,789
Speaker 0: I watched this this one episode and I was obsessed with it Because it does all the things that initial D does except it's not like initial D. It's more like one of those more like I don't know one piece.

425
00:25:35,131 --> 00:25:38,730
Speaker 1: Yeah bleach if I was still high school middle school kid, this would have been the best anime.

426
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:43,043
Speaker 0: I'm against initial D of fighter jets sort of but you've got to earn money.

427
00:25:43,103 --> 00:25:48,456
Speaker 0: The dude has to earn money just like Million, I guess dollars.

428
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:49,800
Speaker 0: Maybe it was yen.

429
00:25:50,261 --> 00:25:52,146
Speaker 1: It was something 1.5

430
00:25:52,146 --> 00:26:07,662
Speaker 0: million something's by piloting fighter jets and being paid to shoot down other fighter jets in what apparently is an endless war with unlimited fighter jets in a place that is vaguely Arabic but not in Africa

431
00:26:07,964 --> 00:26:10,415
Speaker 1: with a war that has no Context a war

432
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:14,270
Speaker 0: where there's just bunch of tanks in the desert a bunch of fighter jets destroy them.

433
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,158
Speaker 0: They get paid like 500 bucks a tank.

434
00:26:16,419 --> 00:26:22,141
Speaker 1: Yep, and there's just like in the video game You shoot things and money pops out just like in Raiden.

435
00:26:22,241 --> 00:26:23,967
Speaker 1: or you know any of those shmups?

436
00:26:24,147 --> 00:26:28,170
Speaker 0: and I was a little kid I thought this was the best thing ever and it didn't go anywhere.

437
00:26:29,011 --> 00:26:31,523
Speaker 1: Well, here's the thing is this is only episode fucking one.

438
00:26:31,643 --> 00:26:33,070
Speaker 1: there's three episodes in this OAV.

439
00:26:33,311 --> 00:26:34,536
Speaker 1: We've only seen the first time.

440
00:26:34,696 --> 00:26:35,741
Speaker 0: there is another area.

441
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:38,090
Speaker 0: eight is a terrible recent TV show.

442
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,483
Speaker 1: Okay, so according to Wikipedia is a long ass manga.

443
00:26:40,523 --> 00:26:41,850
Speaker 1: this 20-something volume never read.

444
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,110
Speaker 1: It is a three episode OAV of which we are only discussing episode one.

445
00:26:45,411 --> 00:26:52,396
Speaker 0: I've only seen one episode if I saw more episodes and their tiny brain does not remember and there is a TV series that is Actually relatively more recent.

446
00:26:52,557 --> 00:26:55,650
Speaker 0: I watched one episode of it and it was I watched it.

447
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:59,450
Speaker 0: All I could think was this feels way bad compared to the original OAV.

448
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,197
Speaker 1: So here's something interesting and the reason.

449
00:27:01,237 --> 00:27:03,205
Speaker 1: we only saw the first episodes OAV.

450
00:27:03,426 --> 00:27:04,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, we had a DVD of it.

451
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:05,092
Speaker 1: We have okay.

452
00:27:05,132 --> 00:27:07,321
Speaker 1: So first CPM put it out on VHS.

453
00:27:07,341 --> 00:27:08,726
Speaker 1: the whole fucking thing, right.

454
00:27:09,368 --> 00:27:17,230
Speaker 1: then CPM put out only the very first episode on DVD, which is what we have.

455
00:27:17,992 --> 00:27:23,969
Speaker 1: Then a DV put out the whole thing on DVD, which we do not have.

456
00:27:25,271 --> 00:27:27,198
Speaker 1: What I have is a u.s.

457
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:32,637
Speaker 0: Manga core complete with their mecha spokesman Mandy guys most dangerous.

458
00:27:33,199 --> 00:27:34,866
Speaker 0: and if I open this up, this is the DVD.

459
00:27:34,906 --> 00:27:35,910
Speaker 0: We actually just watched.

460
00:27:36,051 --> 00:27:39,790
Speaker 0: I don't know when I bought this or how I own it still has a CPM survey card.

461
00:27:40,133 --> 00:27:41,630
Speaker 0: It has the CPM survey card.

462
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:42,252
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna share this.

463
00:27:42,272 --> 00:27:47,950
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure we got this at the first New York anime festival in the CPM going out of business.

464
00:27:48,171 --> 00:27:50,477
Speaker 1: Ultra discount fire sale being ahem.

465
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,624
Speaker 0: What is their annual household income?

466
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,248
Speaker 0: and the highest I can say is over 50k.

467
00:27:55,292 --> 00:27:58,629
Speaker 0: Okay, how many pre-recorded video cassettes do you own?

468

Speaker 0: So it will get there.

494
00:29:05,488 --> 00:29:05,868
Speaker 1: That's true.

495
00:29:06,269 --> 00:29:10,110
Speaker 1: All right, so Let's talk about this actual fucking show.

496
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,759
Speaker 1: So the first episode here you and squadron, here's the deal.

497
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:13,782
Speaker 1: There's a guy.

498
00:29:13,822 --> 00:29:14,906
Speaker 1: he's a badass fighter.

499
00:29:14,966 --> 00:29:16,150
Speaker 1: Shin Kazuma.

500
00:29:16,951 --> 00:29:20,361
Speaker 1: He's piloting this meaningless fighter pilot in this meaningless war in the desert.

501
00:29:20,381 --> 00:29:23,694
Speaker 0: He's pretty he's got side hair and he bears his chest On the cover.

502
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:29,020
Speaker 1: He's at area 88 which is this Airport, basically with all the fighter jets take off.

503
00:29:29,683 --> 00:29:31,630
Speaker 0: There's a gas station in initial D.

504
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:35,442
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are other characters there who are also fighter pilots of various sorts.

505
00:29:35,623 --> 00:29:37,830
Speaker 0: the bearded guy who's like my planes on fire.

506
00:29:37,971 --> 00:29:38,233
Speaker 0: Fuck it.

507
00:29:38,253 --> 00:29:38,918
Speaker 0: Let's keep going.

508
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:40,690
Speaker 1: Most of those other characters don't really matter.

509
00:29:40,931 --> 00:29:46,270
Speaker 1: There's a photographer who's sort of you know, they're witnessing what's going on, but he doesn't really matter either isn't doing anything.

510
00:29:46,371 --> 00:29:47,359
Speaker 0: He's no speedgrapher.

511
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:47,883
Speaker 1: Yeah, nothing.

512
00:29:47,903 --> 00:29:48,770
Speaker 1: He does means anything.

513
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,513
Speaker 1: He's just sort of there.

514
00:29:49,593 --> 00:29:52,946
Speaker 0: as far as I can tell the area 88 TV show focuses mostly on him.

515
00:29:53,388 --> 00:30:06,615
Speaker 1: Oh interesting Yeah, cuz I mean if you did that it would be sort of like a Marvel situation where you have this sort of you know Neutral character sort of giving you the viewpoint of the viewer of the show, you know watching things from the outside Perspective.

516
00:30:06,716 --> 00:30:08,890
Speaker 0: but no this one clearly actually just follows.

517
00:30:09,191 --> 00:30:12,204
Speaker 1: Yeah, all the guy with the camera all he does is bother people.

518
00:30:12,706 --> 00:30:13,630
Speaker 1: There's some other characters.

519
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:18,646
Speaker 1: We barely see them in this first episode except for you know, the impetus of why?

520
00:30:18,706 --> 00:30:21,877
Speaker 1: shin cosmo piloting You know planes in this meaningless war.

521
00:30:21,937 --> 00:30:26,594
Speaker 0: So when I was a kid, I thought that the plot of why he's doing This was amazing.

522
00:30:26,915 --> 00:30:28,099
Speaker 0: It was the best thing ever.

523
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:29,906
Speaker 0: I couldn't oh my god fighter jets.

524
00:30:30,327 --> 00:30:40,989
Speaker 0: So watching it now His friend wants to shtink his girlfriend, yep, so he gets him drunk Yep, and then holds a piece of paper in front of him to sign this.

525
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:42,598
Speaker 1: That's it.

526
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,888
Speaker 1: He signs it That's it.

527
00:30:44,151 --> 00:30:52,939
Speaker 1: That is a con actually a contract to have the guy signed up to go and do the killing fight in the Osron Royal Mercenary Air Force, right?

528
00:30:53,301 --> 00:31:07,230
Speaker 0: He has to either fight for three years Be earn 1.5 million dollars or dessert which I assume they kill you if you dessert Yeah, well if they catch you deserting, yeah, and in the desert you're not gonna make it now.

529
00:31:07,372 --> 00:31:13,338
Speaker 0: uh What's interesting is that he signs this contract and then these dudes with guns come and they're like We're gonna shoot you if you don't come.

530
00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:15,770
Speaker 0: I feel like the contract is unnecessary.

531
00:31:16,712 --> 00:31:19,969
Speaker 0: I feel like they could have just kidnapped him and it's kind of stupid.

532
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:27,599
Speaker 0: up bonus points the guy who shanghaied him Basically did it to marry the daughter and the daughter.

533
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:31,494
Speaker 0: the daughter of this rich guy and the daughter who loves shin is like I'm not gonna marry you.

534
00:31:31,574 --> 00:31:33,722
Speaker 0: I still love shin cuz she's actually kind of cool dude.

535
00:31:33,742 --> 00:31:35,750
Speaker 1: You could marry fucking any girl.

536
00:31:35,891 --> 00:31:40,530
Speaker 1: Why do you need to shanghaied dude to marry that girl also in the preview of the next episode?

537
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:45,029
Speaker 0: He's like she won't marry me because she thinks shins still alive, but doesn't know.

538
00:31:45,691 --> 00:31:51,211
Speaker 0: So he tries to hire a hitman to kill shin while he's still in area 88.

539
00:31:51,211 --> 00:31:53,282
Speaker 1: Why don't you just falsify some evidence that he's dead?

540
00:31:53,463 --> 00:31:57,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, or just say How does she even know he's alive?

541
00:31:57,602 --> 00:31:59,030
Speaker 0: How is killing him going to matter?

542
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:01,317
Speaker 0: Why didn't you just kill him in the first place?

543
00:32:01,337 --> 00:32:03,404
Speaker 1: None of this shit makes fucking any sense at all.

544
00:32:03,665 --> 00:32:05,010
Speaker 1: It's so contrived.

545
00:32:05,251 --> 00:32:06,841
Speaker 0: Maybe the manga tells you more.

546
00:32:07,002 --> 00:32:08,149
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's something I want to say.

547
00:32:08,752 --> 00:32:20,676
Speaker 0: We when we talked about the baron omatsuri the sixth one-piece movie We were inspired to do a lecture which we're gonna do an anime Boston about how every anime Is the same?

548
00:32:20,998 --> 00:32:26,019
Speaker 1: Well, no every anime movie is the same but These are not the same only these movies.

549
00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:28,846
Speaker 0: Well, the slayers motion picture is arguably an OAV.

550
00:32:29,227 --> 00:32:30,170
Speaker 1: Was it never in theaters?

551
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:35,352
Speaker 0: Oh, so if you watch the slayers OAVs, they actually have the same anyway, that's true Those are so.

552
00:32:35,813 --> 00:32:38,801
Speaker 0: there are two classes of those standalone anime things.

553
00:32:39,002 --> 00:32:41,990
Speaker 0: That's one is the baron omatsuri that we're gonna talk about a lot.

554
00:32:42,351 --> 00:32:48,350
Speaker 0: The other is area 88, but the best example of this is the god-awful sanctuary OAV.

555
00:32:49,090 --> 00:33:04,879
Speaker 0: There was an era where there were a ton of OAVs and all they are is let's get all the proper nouns from some really popular manga and Show just enough of it to where everyone who has read that manga is gonna buy this VHS tape or DVD and watch it and go.

556
00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:05,641
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

557
00:33:05,962 --> 00:33:06,764
Speaker 0: There's the character.

558
00:33:06,804 --> 00:33:07,707
Speaker 0: I like from the manga.

559
00:33:07,727 --> 00:33:12,726
Speaker 0: Oh my god There's some foreshadowing for something that will never happen in this OAV exactly.

560
00:33:12,767 --> 00:33:13,590
Speaker 1: Well think about it, right?

561
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:17,330
Speaker 1: It's like, you know nowadays you get an anime series like say Death Note, right?

562
00:33:17,631 --> 00:33:23,150
Speaker 1: Take the whole manga copy the whole damn thing translate the whole show to anime right and put it out on TV.

563
00:33:23,552 --> 00:33:24,399
Speaker 1: That's what they did there.

564
00:33:24,439 --> 00:33:25,990
Speaker 1: this it's back in the day.

565
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:27,903
Speaker 1: They had a lot more money in the anime industry.

566
00:33:27,924 --> 00:33:36,240
Speaker 1: and it's like well Here's this somewhat more obscure not as popular as Dragon Ball Z thing, you know Which is gonna get you know, completely translated into an anime.

567
00:33:36,862 --> 00:33:44,449
Speaker 1: We don't want to make a whole TV series for area 88 so let's sort of squish it down and make an OAV and super fans will buy it and pay a lot of money for it.

568
00:33:44,469 --> 00:33:48,850
Speaker 1: and You know, we only had to produce like three episodes.

569
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:54,347
Speaker 1: Let's just you know copy as much of the plot as we can and squish it in here like the sanctuary.

570
00:33:54,447 --> 00:33:55,290
Speaker 1: one was like episode.

571
00:33:55,411 --> 00:34:00,712
Speaker 1: it's basically volumes one and two of sanctuary animated poorly and That's it.

572
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:06,762
Speaker 1: and they just don't bother continue with the rest of the manga and it's pretty much like hey super fans We animated some of your obscure thing.

573
00:34:06,802 --> 00:34:07,405
Speaker 1: Isn't that cool?

574
00:34:07,707 --> 00:34:11,696
Speaker 1: Yeah So, I mean granted we've only seen OAV one.

575
00:34:11,775 --> 00:34:20,858
Speaker 1: but I mean you're not gonna convince me that if I watch episodes two and three of the OAV that that is going to contain everything that happened in 25 volumes of manga.

576
00:34:20,938 --> 00:34:23,730
Speaker 0: this OAV is notable one because of UN squadron.

577
00:34:24,212 --> 00:34:28,489
Speaker 0: Yes, the video game - it has some pretty dangerous music.

578
00:34:30,518 --> 00:34:32,178
Speaker 0: Good God three.

579
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:38,989
Speaker 0: the characters Have these this ridiculous Foley like when he takes off his helmet.

580
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,168
Speaker 0: There's like this shook noise.

581
00:34:41,231 --> 00:34:48,090
Speaker 0: It's almost as ridiculous as an escaflowne when every sword apparently it consists of nothing but a million raddly pieces of metal.

582
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:55,284
Speaker 0: Everything they do has these like ridiculous noises to the point that I couldn't stop laughing the entire time.

583
00:34:55,606 --> 00:34:59,829
Speaker 1: and how many people can crash land fighter jets on the runway without getting hurt at all?

584
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:03,560
Speaker 0: This is basically someone crash lands a fighter jet behind you the movie.

585
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:07,290
Speaker 1: Nothing is realistic or making sense or they're not even trying.

586
00:35:07,491 --> 00:35:10,604
Speaker 0: So this was directed by a man named Hisayuki Toriyomi.

587
00:35:10,624 --> 00:35:11,487
Speaker 1: Okay, never heard of him.

588
00:35:11,507 --> 00:35:12,110
Speaker 0: I'd never heard of him.

589
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:14,723
Speaker 0: So I did a little bit of research meaning I looked at anime news network.

590
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:21,386
Speaker 0: Okay, and The only thing he is directed that I have ever even heard of.
