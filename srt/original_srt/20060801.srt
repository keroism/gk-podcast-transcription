1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,488
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, August 1st, and this is Geek Nights.

2
00:00:12,909 --> 00:00:16,759
Speaker 0: Tonight, we discuss the video game Super Mario Strikers.

3
00:00:19,222 --> 00:00:20,238
Speaker 1: Let's do this!

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,311
Speaker 0: Today is Tuesday, which means tomorrow is Wednesday.

5
00:00:24,392 --> 00:00:26,420
Speaker 0: In fact, you're probably listening to this on Wednesday.

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,280
Speaker 0: Thursday, we're going to Otacon.

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:30,679
Speaker 1: Otacon hoooo!

8
00:00:32,342 --> 00:00:34,600
Speaker 0: Watch as my sword grows larger.

9
00:00:35,443 --> 00:00:43,320
Speaker 1: Now, because we're going to Otacon, one, next week we're going to have nothing but Geek Nights specials, as opposed to normal Geek Nights episodes.

10
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,900
Speaker 0: Because they're recorded in advance, and, uh, yeah.

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:53,359
Speaker 1: Two, tomorrow is the last show for this week, because Thursday, we will be @Otacon.

12
00:00:54,461 --> 00:00:58,700
Speaker 0: And, you know, it's not fun to record a show while you're at a con.

13
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,760
Speaker 1: Let alone pay for the privilege of uploading a show.

14
00:01:02,042 --> 00:01:04,699
Speaker 0: Actually, I think there's free wireless in the BCC, but...

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,480
Speaker 1: But we can't go into the BCC Thursday.

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,400
Speaker 0: I think it's all the whole Inner Harbor area, but it's just, it's too much effort.

17
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,719
Speaker 0: Screw you guys.

18
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, we may upload little things or post in the forum, but you're not getting much from us.

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,790
Speaker 0: Nope, not much at all.

20
00:01:18,052 --> 00:01:18,274
Speaker 0: Maybe...

21
00:01:18,838 --> 00:01:19,040
Speaker 1: yeah.

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,970
Speaker 1: Now also, Wednesday is not going to be a normal episode.

23
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:24,380
Speaker 1: It is going to be the Otacon pregame.

24
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:38,039
Speaker 1: So, if you're coming to Otacon, and you are curious as to how, when, where, and why you can or would want to be able to see us, that will be the best idea of where we're going to be and when, and what we'll be doing at the con.

25
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:46,860
Speaker 0: In addition to some other things, like things you might want to check out at the con, and all kinds of other, you know, this year specific con info and tips from us.

26
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,520
Speaker 0: But if you're not going to Otacon, don't even bother listening tomorrow.

27
00:01:51,241 --> 00:01:53,820
Speaker 1: No, listen anyway, because you should care about Otacon a lot.

28
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:57,035
Speaker 0: If you're in the Northeast U.S.

29
00:01:57,095 --> 00:01:57,900
Speaker 0: and you're a geek, yes.

30
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,080
Speaker 1: If you live East of the Mississippi, and you are in any way a geek...

31
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,000
Speaker 0: Well, well, North of the... well, I guess no, the Mason-Dixon is real close to Otacon, so...

32
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, people from the South go to Otacon.

33
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,559
Speaker 0: Carolina and North should care.

34
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:17,239
Speaker 1: The one thing about Otacon is that very definitely there is a lot more traffic clogging up I-95 North than I-95 South after the con.

35
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,669
Speaker 0: Yeah, that is true.

36
00:02:18,952 --> 00:02:19,660
Speaker 0: That is very true.

37
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,706
Speaker 1: But anyway, it is gaming day.

38
00:02:21,887 --> 00:02:25,818
Speaker 1: We've got a lot to say about Super Mario Strikers, but we'll get to that.

39
00:02:27,201 --> 00:02:34,780
Speaker 0: Right now, we have... was probably the hottest news this week, and we know we're recording this on Sunday, right?

40
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:47,500
Speaker 1: Yes, right now the press date is Sunday, July 30th at 956 PM, therefore, if there are any breaking developments after that time, we will not have that information tonight.

41
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,042
Speaker 0: Well, here's the thing.

42
00:02:48,062 --> 00:02:59,446
Speaker 0: There's a news story about E3, and the final word about this news story is going to be on Monday, which is tomorrow, which is after we're recording this, and before you're listening to it.

43
00:02:59,928 --> 00:03:04,400
Speaker 0: So you're going to know the full story, but we can't talk about that because we don't know it yet.

44
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,900
Speaker 1: So we're not going to talk a lot about the details of what's going on, and we're going to talk a lot more about what we think the ramifications will be.

45
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,793
Speaker 0: Yes, now, the story is...

46
00:03:13,183 --> 00:03:15,454
Speaker 1: The story was that E3 is cancelled.

47
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:16,780
Speaker 0: Way to go, Dave.

48
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:24,946
Speaker 0: There was one website that decided, I think, next-gen, and they wanted to bring a lot of traffic to their site and be all,

49
00:03:25,006 --> 00:03:25,428
Speaker 0: "Oooh!"

50
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:26,352
Speaker 0: with a hot story.

51
00:03:26,734 --> 00:03:29,380
Speaker 0: So they put up a news story that said E3 is cancelled.

52
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,046
Speaker 0: Ars Technica is reporting that.

53
00:03:32,187 --> 00:03:32,789
Speaker 0: that's bullshit.

54
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:41,540
Speaker 0: Now, E3 is run by the Entertainment Software Association, which is sort of like the RIAA for video games, or the MPAA for video games.

55
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,427
Speaker 0: And they run E3 as part of what they do.

56
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:54,299
Speaker 0: And E3 isn't really useful anymore, as useful, for a variety of reasons.

57
00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:07,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, we've talked about it before, but basically, E3 is... All the people who want to go to E3 and who do go to E3 now, they want it to be a convention where they can hang out and play video games and learn about video games and have a good time.

58
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,320
Speaker 0: And play the newest video games before everyone else because it's so cool and awesome.

59
00:04:11,742 --> 00:04:16,499
Speaker 1: Also, especially not so much now, because now every dick in the world can go to E3.

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,291
Speaker 1: It's not hard to get into E3.

61
00:04:19,915 --> 00:04:21,019
Speaker 1: But it used to be a lot more difficult.

62
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,928
Speaker 0: I mean, it's technically very difficult.

63
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:24,817
Speaker 0: You have to actually be in the industry.

64
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:26,980
Speaker 0: The problem is that it really isn't difficult.

65
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,838
Speaker 1: And like two, three, four years ago, people who went to E3, it was like, "I went to

66
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:31,938
Speaker 1: E3."

67
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,350
Speaker 1: And people would go, "What?

68
00:04:33,553 --> 00:04:34,200
Speaker 1: Wow.".

69
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,332
Speaker 0: Well, because E3 is supposed to be a trade show.

70
00:04:37,413 --> 00:04:44,519
Speaker 0: A trade show is when a bunch of companies in the same industry all set up booths in a big room and network with each other and do business.

71
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,480
Speaker 1: Simultaneously, usually.

72
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,160
Speaker 0: And they show off the latest products to the press.

73
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:54,820
Speaker 1: Yes, the press are the biggest key there because the press will see everything and write press releases on it and news articles about it.

74
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,780
Speaker 0: Well, not press releases.

75
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,640
Speaker 1: Well, they will watch the press releases and then report on them.

76
00:04:58,743 --> 00:04:58,958
Speaker 1: Yes.

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,660
Speaker 1: And then they will write press articles about them.

78
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,392
Speaker 0: And this wasn't easy to do back in the day.

79
00:05:03,452 --> 00:05:06,719
Speaker 0: If you had a new product back in the day, how could you show it off?

80
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,819
Speaker 0: You couldn't just make a website for it.

81
00:05:09,381 --> 00:05:18,219
Speaker 0: You either had to hold an event and get people to come to your company to show them this new amazing product and have a press conference, which is a pain in the ass.

82
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:24,220
Speaker 0: Or you could just go to a trade show and save all your new products for the trade show.

83
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,780
Speaker 0: And then all the press would see your new product and you don't have to hold a press conference at your company.

84
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:37,006
Speaker 1: Now, because E3 has gotten bigger and bigger, it has become filled with people like me and Scott, who generally are just in the way of this industry trying to do what it wants to do.

85
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:37,540
Speaker 0: Yes.

86
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:44,840
Speaker 0: The point of E3 is that companies would show their stuff to each other, see what each other is doing and show their stuff to the press.

87
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:49,320
Speaker 0: And number one, it's becoming too expensive to go to E3 as a company.

88
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:57,300
Speaker 0: It's much cheaper to just put your press release out on the Internet or hold a little press conference or make a website or put it, you know, anything like that.

89
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:58,880
Speaker 0: And it's just as effective.

90
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,780
Speaker 0: Back in the day, you needed a trade show.

91
00:06:00,982 --> 00:06:01,673
Speaker 0: Now you don't.

92
00:06:02,381 --> 00:06:08,946
Speaker 0: And E3 is a lot more expensive than a press release on the Internet to Engadget or to Kotaku or any other video game.

93
00:06:08,986 --> 00:06:15,580
Speaker 0: blog or IGN can put out your, you know, news just as effectively if you just send them a note with a picture.

94
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:22,900
Speaker 0: So these companies all spend money on E3 and they're not getting so much.

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,700
Speaker 0: What they're getting is a bunch of gamers waiting in line to play the Wii and they're not getting enough press people enough time playing the Wii.

96
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,253
Speaker 1: Yeah.

97
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:33,620
Speaker 1: Well, Sony didn't have this problem, at least no one is waiting in line to play their stuff.

98
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,100
Speaker 1: Yeah.

99
00:06:34,741 --> 00:06:41,260
Speaker 0: I mean, the way it's really supposed to be is that you assume that everyone walking around the convention is either press or industry.

100
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:49,200
Speaker 0: So what happens, though, is at E3, they have to have all this stuff behind closed doors and that way you can't get as many press people seeing it.

101
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,460
Speaker 1: But the thing is, E3 was supposed to be the thing behind closed doors.

102
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,800
Speaker 1: You shouldn't have closed doors inside of the closed doors.

103
00:06:55,102 --> 00:06:57,259
Speaker 1: That's like the champagne room and there's no sex in there.

104
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:57,815
Speaker 0: Yeah.

105
00:07:01,002 --> 00:07:02,700
Speaker 1: There's just champagne and a PSP.

106
00:07:04,661 --> 00:07:07,980
Speaker 0: So E3 is really not what it's supposed to be.

107
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:16,360
Speaker 0: Another thing about E3 is that it's supposed to be a place where, since it's just industry and press, the small guy can get noticed.

108
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:23,221
Speaker 0: He can set up a booth and show off his amazing new gaming technology and all the cool press type.

109
00:07:23,262 --> 00:07:27,100
Speaker 0: people will see it because normally they wouldn't pay attention to that shit.

110
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:33,180
Speaker 0: But they walk around E3, they see all the major players, and then they walk over and they see all the small time players.

111
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,999
Speaker 0: And if you have a good show in your booth, they'll maybe say something about it.

112
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:44,159
Speaker 1: Now the thing is, the news so far is that E3 is trying to go back to its roots of generally press and industry only.

113
00:07:45,102 --> 00:07:49,585
Speaker 1: It looks like they're going to downsize significantly and not let the teeming, mouth-breathing masses in.

114
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,440
Speaker 0: And they're also trying to make it no longer the Sony/Microsoft/Nintendo show that it's become.

115
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,700
Speaker 0: They're trying to make it more of a, you know, the whole gaming industry show.

116
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,840
Speaker 1: All the people who couldn't have a press release that anyone would care about.

117
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:12,780
Speaker 0: Yep, they're going to finally get what they want at E3, and the press people will be happy because now they don't have to wait in a freaking line to do their job behind a million crazy fanboys.

118
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:24,176
Speaker 1: Now the one thing I wonder, one, and this is really related to my second thing, that Penny Arcade is generally regarded as the most influential entity on gaming in America today.

119
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:25,639
Speaker 0: One of them.

120
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,999
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're up there.

121
00:08:27,281 --> 00:08:29,360
Speaker 1: They are definitely very, very influential.

122
00:08:30,241 --> 00:08:33,578
Speaker 1: I assume that the new E3 will still allow them in as press.

123
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:40,919
Speaker 0: But here's the thing, what's Penny Arcade going to do if there aren't a million crazy fans to come visit them at the convention, at the E3 Tracer?

124
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,220
Speaker 1: Well, I know what Taika will do.

125
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:45,380
Speaker 1: He'll wander around looking at all the indie games and then talk about them at length.

126
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,098
Speaker 0: That's what he will do, yes.

127
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:53,535
Speaker 0: But it's going to be, you know, for some people, you know, there's going to be less reason for them to go to E3.

128
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,180
Speaker 1: But the thing is, a lot of the people who will have less reason to go are the people that they don't want there in the first place.

129
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:58,600
Speaker 1: Yep.

130
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:14,720
Speaker 0: Now here's another thing, is that since E3 was supposed to be a trade show, but has become more of a convention/trade show, if they try to kick the convention stuff out, which I think they should, all those convention people, they might migrate to PAX.

131
00:09:15,363 --> 00:09:18,400
Speaker 1: Now, this is my RIMS official Geek Nights prediction.

132
00:09:19,301 --> 00:09:30,537
Speaker 1: I think that if this happens, and E3 actually does kick out all the fans and all the people who aren't part of the industry, that the Penny Arcade Expo is going to explode, absolutely explode.

133
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,440
Speaker 1: I mean, it's already, I would say, the number two video game con in America.

134
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,219
Speaker 0: Now here's another thing, though.

135
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,060
Speaker 0: Think about that for a second.

136
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:43,912
Speaker 0: Penny Arcade is a webcomic that was started five, six, something years ago, seven years ago.

137
00:09:44,643 --> 00:09:49,138
Speaker 1: A little more, I don't actually remember when it started, all I know is I can't imagine a time when I didn't read it.

138
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,454
Speaker 0: Yeah, it started like late high school, early college, so '99, 2000, right?

139
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, but as big as it is, it's just a webcomic.

140
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:07,720
Speaker 0: It's a webcomic, and the webcomic was so popular, and there was a webcomic about video games that they made a little video game convention, a little gaming convention in Seattle-ish area, right?

141
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:09,139
Speaker 1: They've had, what, two of them?

142
00:10:09,461 --> 00:10:10,960
Speaker 0: I think there's been two or three of them, yeah.

143
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:15,400
Speaker 1: And it's already become a very large convention, especially compared to most other kinds.

144
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:23,199
Speaker 0: And if E3 goes down, and all those E3 people who can't get into E3 now go to PAX instead, think about that.

145
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:30,852
Speaker 0: A webcomic, one webcomic has its own convention, and it becomes as crazy as the convention part of E3.

146
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:36,280
Speaker 1: I mean, for all of you who think, "Oh, Megatokyo was huge back in the day," Megatokyo never had a convention.

147
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, Megatokyo had a panel at Otacon that had a long line.

148
00:10:39,703 --> 00:10:41,700
Speaker 0: He never had his own convention.

149
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,018
Speaker 1: Not only their own, but two!

150
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,600
Speaker 1: Penny Arcade is thinking seriously about having an East Coast and a West Coast PAX.

151
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,740
Speaker 0: That's been rumored.

152
00:10:49,201 --> 00:10:52,280
Speaker 0: I hope so, because it's hard to go to West Coast PAX.

153
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,634
Speaker 1: Yes, hence I covered my butt by saying "thinking about," though I can say with fair certainty that we're going to PAX next year.

154
00:10:56,694 --> 00:10:57,180
Speaker 1: come hell.

155
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I have to agree.

156
00:11:01,925 --> 00:11:03,938
Speaker 0: So yeah, E3, what are they gonna do?

157
00:11:04,601 --> 00:11:05,480
Speaker 0: We'll find out Monday.

158
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,700
Speaker 0: You probably already know, because it's Tuesday.

159
00:11:08,182 --> 00:11:08,338
Speaker 0: Yes.

160
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,220
Speaker 0: But here, it's Sunday.

161
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,000
Speaker 1: And we don't have another news, because we think that covered it for news.

162
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,258
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think so, too.

163
00:11:22,761 --> 00:11:24,280
Speaker 0: And things of the day!

164
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,040
Speaker 0: Things of tomorrow!

165
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,819
Speaker 0: Wait, no, things of two days ago.

166
00:11:29,741 --> 00:11:38,520
Speaker 1: Alright, anyway, this I actually didn't have a good thing of the day, and I didn't feel like trolling around, so I did my usual "look on Google" video for something funny.

167
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:46,859
Speaker 1: Now for anyone who watches the show Reno 911, which I don't, but I've seen many episodes and clips of it over the years, and I do enjoy the show.

168
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,420
Speaker 1: Maybe partly due to my general distrust of police officers, which you're gonna hear about at some point in the future.

169
00:11:53,661 --> 00:12:11,140
Speaker 1: Anyway, this is a bit that has probably been seen fairly widely, but I find it hilarious of some guy playing D&D LARP, and he's shot another guy with an arrow, and the two Reno 911 police guys are trying to get out of him why he shot this guy with the arrow.

170
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:16,979
Speaker 1: And if you've ever played a live-action role-playing game, or Dungeons & Dragons, you will find this hilarious.

171
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:24,478
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the only problem with it, is it's really not funny if you don't understand D&D, because the guy runs away and he's like, "Hey, boots of what,

172
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:24,820
Speaker 0: escaping?"

173
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,001
Speaker 0: Boots

174
00:12:25,042 --> 00:12:26,895
Speaker 1: of escaping, and the cop pulls out a gun and is like,

175
00:12:26,975 --> 00:12:27,257
Speaker 0: "Bam!"

176
00:12:28,821 --> 00:12:30,915
Speaker 1: Plus the fact that the one cop knows about the game.

177
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:38,755
Speaker 1: So he's like, "I rolled an 18," and the cop's like, "Yes, you rolled an 18 and you hit him right there with the three-point arm," and the other cop's like, "Shut

178
00:12:38,896 --> 00:12:38,956
Speaker 1: up.".

179
00:12:40,545 --> 00:12:41,600
Speaker 1: It's funny, it's worth watching.

180
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,380
Speaker 0: Alright, mine needs a little explanation.

181
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:52,500
Speaker 0: On BoardGameGeek.com, which is a website that has a database of every board game, and it's pretty much the only website for board gaming on the internet.

182
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,440
Speaker 1: We've linked to it many times.

183
00:12:54,540 --> 00:13:01,359
Speaker 0: Yes, they have a feature known as the Geek List, and what you can do is you can make a list of things, usually games.

184
00:13:02,621 --> 00:13:11,900
Speaker 0: And you make a list of games, and at the top you post what the list is, and then below you have the list of games, and then people can comment on each item in the list.

185
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,857
Speaker 0: It's actually pretty cool.

186
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,100
Speaker 0: Someone made a list that's pretty interesting that I felt like making it a thing of the day.

187
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:27,420
Speaker 0: The list is free computer versions of board and card games with artificial intelligence computer opponents and with screenshots.

188
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,779
Speaker 1: It is exactly what that says.

189
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,119
Speaker 0: It is exactly what that says.

190
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:43,659
Speaker 0: So if there are board games or card games that you want to play against AI computer opponents and you would like to see screenshots of those games before you play them for free, this is a list of some of them.

191
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,400
Speaker 0: The top one is a game of Tigris and Euphrates that I've tried to play, and it never really works so well.

192
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,860
Speaker 0: I think it's because I have a bad Java or it's poorly written.

193
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:54,319
Speaker 1: I consider it unplayable.

194
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:54,750
Speaker 0: Yeah.

195
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:58,060
Speaker 0: The next one is Modern Art, which is pretty cool.

196
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,158
Speaker 0: It's a bidding game.

197
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,853
Speaker 0: San Juan, Web of Power, St.

198
00:14:03,913 --> 00:14:06,080
Speaker 0: Petersburg, Space Hulk, you get the idea.

199
00:14:06,682 --> 00:14:15,540
Speaker 0: All these board and card games that people really like, and free downloadable or web playable versions of those games that you don't need friends to play.

200
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,251
Speaker 1: Alright.

201
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,999
Speaker 0: Very useful for learning new games, especially complicated ones like EuroRail.

202
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:27,579
Speaker 1: Well I remember way back when Scojo and Alicia would play Settlers Online to the exclusion of life itself.

203
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, I played Settlers Online, but not to the exclusion of anything else.

204
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,276
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course playing Settlers Online was just cemented home into us.

205
00:14:35,316 --> 00:14:36,937
Speaker 1: the idea that Settlers is a broken game.

206
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:45,519
Speaker 0: In fact, the Java version of Settlers and the Microsoft version that is not free is also on the list.

207
00:14:46,165 --> 00:14:46,380
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

208
00:14:46,924 --> 00:14:47,070
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

209
00:14:47,745 --> 00:14:47,920
Speaker 1: Alright.

210
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:56,879
Speaker 1: Now, we've been debating buying Super Mario Strikers for a long time, and we nominally were waiting until it fell in price.

211
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,492
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, it's a $50 game.

212
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:00,480
Speaker 0: It's hard to find it used.

213
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,500
Speaker 0: I tried to buy it on eBay for $40 instead of $50, and I got outbid.

214
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:05,491
Speaker 0: So...

215
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,940
Speaker 1: The price never came down.

216
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,498
Speaker 1: So the other day...

217
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,780
Speaker 0: And it seemed like stores were running out of copies, like it wasn't an easy game to get anymore.

218
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,180
Speaker 0: It used to be everywhere, and now it was sort of disappearing.

219
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:25,120
Speaker 1: Yep, so finally we were bored, mostly because there aren't many good two-player games, other than Advance Wars, which Scott won't play with me, and Hellas, which is...

220
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,079
Speaker 0: I will, just not often.

221
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:32,100
Speaker 1: Hellas, which is a terrible game, and games we've already beaten, or require three or four people.

222
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,499
Speaker 0: So now we've played Mario Strikers, which is soccer, Mario soccer, in the store on demo machines, and it's a lot of fun.

223
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:45,092
Speaker 0: And I wanted it, I wanted it, I wasn't gonna pay $50 for it, I finally said, "Fine, I'll pay $50 for it,".

224
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:45,518
Speaker 0: and I bought it.

225
00:15:46,163 --> 00:15:47,500
Speaker 0: And I think it was worth $50.

226
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:53,200
Speaker 1: I'll say right now, if you don't have time to listen to the whole episode, Super Mario Strikers is freaking badass.

227
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,560
Speaker 1: It is an amazing, awesome, incredibly fun game.

228
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,068
Speaker 0: Yep.

229
00:15:57,741 --> 00:15:59,880
Speaker 0: Now, basically, you play soccer.

230
00:16:00,421 --> 00:16:03,960
Speaker 1: Now, the difference is that there are no, really, rules.

231
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:11,779
Speaker 1: I mean, there's no offsides, there's no out-of-bounds, you can kill the other guy, you can throw shells at each other.

232
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:19,416
Speaker 0: Sort of like NBA Jam, or, you know, you can just hit people, dunk, break the rim, do whatever you want.

233
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:29,220
Speaker 1: Now, in keeping with all of the other Mario sports games, the controls are very simple, and yet at the same time allow for a great wealth of strategy and skilled play.

234
00:16:29,493 --> 00:16:29,619
Speaker 1: Yep.

235
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,600
Speaker 0: Basically, what you can do is, well, let's describe the game.

236
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,140
Speaker 0: It's not real soccer, like FIFA soccer.

237
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,780
Speaker 1: It's four-on-four soccer.

238
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,080
Speaker 0: It's five-on-five with, you know, one of the people as a goal.

239
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,040
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, with the alligator.

240
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:49,720
Speaker 0: You pick first your team captain, which is Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Waluigi, Wario, Yoshi, Donkey Kong.

241
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,600
Speaker 1: And the secret one, which, spoiler alert, it's a robot.

242
00:16:54,084 --> 00:16:54,780
Speaker 0: It's not cool.

243
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,340
Speaker 0: It's kind of lame, and it's a cheap.

244
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,617
Speaker 0: It's basically, you should only use that team if you're nubs, because that's sort of a cheating team.

245
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,999
Speaker 1: Unless we both use that team.

246
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:03,440
Speaker 0: Yeah.

247
00:17:03,762 --> 00:17:04,377
Speaker 0: Then it would be fair.

248
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:12,419
Speaker 0: But anyway, then you choose your sidekicks, which are Toads, Birdos, Koopa Troopas, and Hammer Brothers.

249
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:13,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, Hammer Brothers.

250
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,599
Speaker 0: And you get three of those, so let's say you pick Luigi, Hammer Brother.

251
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,900
Speaker 0: Your team consists of a Luigi and three Hammer Brothers.

252
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:24,240
Speaker 0: Your goalie is always an alligator from Donkey Kong.

253
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,118
Speaker 1: Who you don't control.

254
00:17:25,362 --> 00:17:27,359
Speaker 0: You don't control the goalie at all.

255
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:27,834
Speaker 0: None.

256
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,160
Speaker 0: You can't even enable goalie control.

257
00:17:30,941 --> 00:17:33,139
Speaker 0: And it's a good thing and a bad thing.

258
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:39,040
Speaker 0: It's a good thing because the game now is mostly the strategy of, you know, field strategy.

259
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:44,880
Speaker 0: And you don't have to worry about, you know, trying to control the goalie while you're also trying to take the ball away from the opponent.

260
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:56,360
Speaker 0: But at the same time, is it really now a game of you versus your opponent, or is it a game of who is better against the computer-controlled goalies, me or the rim?

261
00:17:56,841 --> 00:18:05,239
Speaker 1: I think it's still the former, mainly because while you can figure out ways to get around the goalie, and in fact, the instruction book and such kind of give you hints at how to get around the goalie.

262
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,319
Speaker 1: And there are a lot of very well-defined ways to get around the goalie.

263
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,939
Speaker 1: But everyone knows those.

264
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:20,200
Speaker 1: So the game is still, how do I set this up so I can get it through the goalie when he knows what I'm trying to do, and he's about to slam my dude against that electric fence?

265
00:18:20,481 --> 00:18:31,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, it really, what it does is it's not a game about scoring goals so much as is it a game about maneuvering your guys on the field in a strategic way in real time.

266
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,640
Speaker 1: Now the controls, well like I said, are very simple.

267
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,620
Speaker 1: But generally, you hit A to pass and B to shoot.

268
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,740
Speaker 1: And then variations thereof.

269
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,458
Speaker 1: Like if you're on your own side and you hit B, instead of shooting, you clear it to the other side.

270
00:18:45,441 --> 00:18:50,880
Speaker 1: And you can hold L down to modify either an A or B to do a lob shot or a lob pass.

271
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,460
Speaker 0: That kind of puts it up in the air.

272
00:18:52,780 --> 00:19:00,500
Speaker 0: So like if I want to pass it to my teammate, and there's a guy on the other team in the way, a lob pass will go over his head instead of on the ground.

273
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,160
Speaker 1: But also, the person catching a lob pass has to slow down and spend some time catching.

274
00:19:04,281 --> 00:19:05,978
Speaker 0: Yeah, they have to jump up and get it.

275
00:19:06,481 --> 00:19:08,680
Speaker 0: So, you know, you gotta really think about what you're doing.

276
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:17,620
Speaker 1: And then there's also a nice mechanic of when you have the ball, say I hit A to pass and before it hits the guy I'm passing it to, I hit A again and let go.

277
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,358
Speaker 1: When it hits him, he'll automatically and immediately do a one-touch pass to the next person.

278
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:23,098
Speaker 0: From the air.

279
00:19:23,881 --> 00:19:35,460
Speaker 0: It's a lot like Smash Brothers and other fighting games where there's very specific commands and animations that guys do and you have to optimize them to make exactly what you want to happen happen.

280
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:42,480
Speaker 1: So you tap like AAB when you have your guys set up and it'll go pass, pass, and the third guy will automatically shoot at the goal.

281
00:19:43,102 --> 00:19:49,176
Speaker 0: And there's all sorts of things like if a guy gets the ball and then pushes A, he'll pass it.

282
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:59,800
Speaker 0: But if you push A, if the ball is loose and you push A as you approach the ball, he'll do like an off the cuff pass and it's a different kind of thing and it works differently.

283
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,279
Speaker 0: It's actually better in some ways.

284
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,659
Speaker 1: And with shots, you can also charge it up.

285
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,700
Speaker 1: And normally you hold B down and the longer you hold it, the stronger your shot is.

286
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,660
Speaker 1: And your non-main character dudes will max out at a certain point.

287
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,218
Speaker 1: But your main character can hold it for a while and do a super shot.

288
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:21,119
Speaker 1: where then there's a mini, you know, hit A in the right sequence to be able to do the super shot.

289
00:20:21,139 --> 00:20:23,380
Speaker 1: that gets you two points and gets by the goalie automatically.

290
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:28,460
Speaker 0: And it's like you can't let the team, only the team captain can make the super shot.

291
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:39,073
Speaker 1: And it's not at all unbalancing or cheat because you, it's really hard to pull off because you need to be sitting wide open for a long time without anyone coming up and bothering you.

292
00:20:39,381 --> 00:20:44,700
Speaker 1: Now it really adds a lot to the game in the fact that a breakaway in this game alone means nothing.

293
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,277
Speaker 1: So by adding this, if you have a breakaway, that just means you have a chance to pull this off.

294
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,060
Speaker 0: There's also the strategy of you get items in the game.

295
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,340
Speaker 0: You get items for different things.

296
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,914
Speaker 0: I think you get an item whenever you make a shot on goal.

297
00:20:56,974 --> 00:20:58,919
Speaker 0: if it's blocked by the goalie that would have gone in.

298
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,160
Speaker 0: Yep.

299
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,500
Speaker 1: You get an item if the other person checks or slide tackles one of your guys when he doesn't have the ball.

300
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:04,940
Speaker 0: Right.

301
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:09,180
Speaker 0: So if you have the ball, you can, if you hit the person who has the ball, that's fine.

302
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,060
Speaker 0: If you hit the person who just had the ball, that's fine.

303
00:21:12,801 --> 00:21:17,999
Speaker 0: If you hit the person who doesn't have the ball at all, they get an item or their items get better.

304
00:21:18,363 --> 00:21:19,498
Speaker 0: So you don't want to do that.

305
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:27,060
Speaker 1: Granted, if there's a key strategy, like if Scott's about to shoot and I know it's going to go in, I'll do everything I can to slide tackle the guy who's passing it to him.

306
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:32,100
Speaker 0: Or if the other guy already has some awesome items, hit him all over the place, who cares if his items get better.

307
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,900
Speaker 1: Because once his items max out, they can't get better than that.

308
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:38,460
Speaker 0: Of course, there are some very rare, very good items like the Chain Chomp.

309
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:38,998
Speaker 1: The Chain Chomp?

310
00:21:39,141 --> 00:21:40,160
Speaker 0: And the Golden Star.

311
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:46,420
Speaker 1: Oh, I forget the exact words from the instruction book, but the Chain Chomp annihilates the other team in its entirety for a short amount of time.

312
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:57,800
Speaker 0: So if you keep hitting the other team when they don't have the ball, then eventually they'll get a Chain Chomp, which means they push one button and your whole team is wiped out and they got clear to make the awesome shot.

313
00:21:59,582 --> 00:22:02,200
Speaker 0: So yeah, there's other strategies to use the items.

314
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:11,920
Speaker 0: So let's say I'm running down the field and I pass it to my team captain and then he shoots the red shells and it knocks down the other team and then he takes the super shot.

315
00:22:12,682 --> 00:22:13,759
Speaker 0: It's strategies like that.

316
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,380
Speaker 1: Or Scott's got a breakaway and he's about to do the super shot.

317
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,998
Speaker 1: I use a mushroom and send my toad on super speed to slide tackle him from behind and stop it.

318
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:30,200
Speaker 0: But not only that, but when you're making the super shot, this meter appears on the screen and you have to put the little lines inside the green areas on this meter.

319
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:30,979
Speaker 0: It's not easy.

320
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,000
Speaker 0: It's really hard to do it every time, but the other player can wiggle the C-stick and it shakes your meter.

321
00:22:37,301 --> 00:22:39,700
Speaker 0: So it's really hard to put it in the green area.

322
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,220
Speaker 1: Now other controls that you might need to be aware of is that when you're on the defensive, you can hit A to change between your characters.

323
00:22:46,661 --> 00:22:47,199
Speaker 0: You can do that.

324
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,560
Speaker 1: It's kind of like passing.

325
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,019
Speaker 1: Well, you can't do it when you have the ball.

326
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:50,454
Speaker 0: Right.

327
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:50,800
Speaker 0: Right.

328
00:22:50,961 --> 00:22:52,340
Speaker 1: It's like passing, but there's no balls.

329
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,140
Speaker 1: So it's instantaneous.

330
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:53,288
Speaker 1: Yep.

331
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:57,720
Speaker 1: You can hit B to do a slide tackle and all the sidekicks do it differently.

332
00:22:58,161 --> 00:22:59,660
Speaker 1: Some go further, some hit harder.

333
00:23:00,202 --> 00:23:03,079
Speaker 1: And if you slide tackle someone successfully and they have the ball, you take it from them.

334
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:05,640
Speaker 1: Or you can hit Y to do a hard hit.

335
00:23:06,561 --> 00:23:10,577
Speaker 1: When you hit someone hard, you knock them down and they're out of commission for a little bit.

336
00:23:10,861 --> 00:23:13,160
Speaker 1: And if you hit them into the wall, they're out of commission even longer.

337
00:23:13,743 --> 00:23:14,700
Speaker 1: But you don't get the ball.

338
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:17,880
Speaker 1: The ball just kind of gets knocked freely and then anyone can grab it who's nearby.

339
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:18,529
Speaker 0: Yeah.

340
00:23:19,101 --> 00:23:22,640
Speaker 0: There's two different hits and you have to figure out which one to use depending on the situation.

341
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:32,240
Speaker 0: You know, like if someone is a little farther away, maybe your guys slide tackle farther, but maybe someone's about to make a supercharged up shot.

342
00:23:32,341 --> 00:23:33,739
Speaker 0: Well, you need to knock them down fast.

343
00:23:33,881 --> 00:23:34,520
Speaker 0: Use the power hit.

344
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:40,340
Speaker 1: The only other control is that you can use the Y button or the C stick when you have the ball to deke.

345
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,759
Speaker 1: Now say you're running and there's a defender in front of you.

346
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:48,117
Speaker 1: If you implement it, if you do it successfully, you can kind of dodge around him before he slide tackles you.

347
00:23:49,001 --> 00:23:54,240
Speaker 1: And also when you're about to shoot, you can use that to fake the goalie out or fake the opponent out.

348
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,257
Speaker 1: I was going to shoot, but I wasn't.

349
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,120
Speaker 0: You can also fake the opponent.

350
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,400
Speaker 0: Like if you'd start charging up a shot, you can push A while it's charging to pass instead.

351
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:08,820
Speaker 1: It's a great strategy to run up, charge up, and just before the guy behind you slide tackles you, do a pass, pass, and then a shot.

352
00:24:09,021 --> 00:24:10,540
Speaker 1: So it'll go bink, bink, and then go in.

353
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,759
Speaker 0: Or it's like a pass and a lob shot or something like that.

354
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,799
Speaker 0: There's a lot of really good stuff you can do.

355
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:24,599
Speaker 0: Also, if you pass to someone who is like in the prime area for scoring a goal, the ball will have this trail behind it.

356
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:33,920
Speaker 0: And if you push B or A while that trail is on the ball, then your guy will either do what is known as a perfect shot or a perfect pass.

357
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,299
Speaker 0: It's kind of fancy.

358
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:40,098
Speaker 0: It really, it just looks like the game slows down a bit like, "Oh no,

359
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:40,420
Speaker 0: shits!".

360
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,745
Speaker 1: It's like perfect slow motion.

361
00:24:41,805 --> 00:24:54,360
Speaker 1: and there was a beautiful moment at one point where I was running behind a guy who had the ball, Scott's guy, and he just passed it to a person who was doing the slow motion thing, but I had just started a hard tackle.

362
00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:06,879
Speaker 1: So I see his guy like flipping up to do the bicycle kick in slow motion, meanwhile I see my guy just slamming his guy and you see the guy falling to the ground face first in slow motion as the ball goes in.

363
00:25:07,121 --> 00:25:07,510
Speaker 1: And as soon as...

364
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,756
Speaker 0: Yep, yep, yep.

365
00:25:09,461 --> 00:25:13,800
Speaker 0: Also, you can do like perfect lob passes and perfect lob shots.

366
00:25:14,002 --> 00:25:15,420
Speaker 0: It gets really complex.

367
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:27,300
Speaker 0: You know, that's how you get the guys to do the crazy aerial maneuvers, is you do like a lob pass to the guy when he's right in front of the goal and you push B and he'll jump up in the air and do like a hurricane kick or something.

368
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,020
Speaker 1: Now the only other control is that when the goalie has the ball, and one, the goalie is invincible.

369
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,458
Speaker 1: Items do not hurt him.

370
00:25:33,801 --> 00:25:36,639
Speaker 1: If you go anywhere near him and you're an opponent, he will punch you.

371
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,499
Speaker 0: And frickin' kick your ass, too.

372
00:25:38,801 --> 00:25:39,560
Speaker 0: It really sucks.

373
00:25:39,761 --> 00:25:44,540
Speaker 1: If you hit him straight on with balls enough, he'll get dizzy for a minute.

374
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,919
Speaker 0: Yeah, like if you charge up a shot and kick it straight in his face, he'll be dizzy.

375
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,120
Speaker 0: Which means if you can get another shot off quick enough, it's gonna go in.

376
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:59,260
Speaker 1: He's also realistic, like say you have a guy in the way and Scott shoots at my goalie, but one of my toads jumps in front of it and blocks the shot.

377
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:06,740
Speaker 1: The goalie already committed, so he still dives for the shot and he's still out of place if Scott shoots again, just like it would have been in a real game of football.

378
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:14,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not, the goalie's not invincible, but depending on the difficulty level you set the game at, and it has four difficulty levels, it's harder to get around him.

379
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:22,800
Speaker 1: But if the goalie gets the ball, you can hit A to pass the ball short to someone, or you can hit B to lob clear the ball all the way to the other side of the screen.

380
00:26:23,342 --> 00:26:24,240
Speaker 0: And that's Mario soccer.

381
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:28,219
Speaker 1: That's the whole game, other than they're the characters, and they're all different as usual.

382
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,700
Speaker 1: You know, Peach and Daisy are faster, Waluigi is tricky, I like Waluigi.

383
00:26:34,082 --> 00:26:38,300
Speaker 0: DK and Wario are slower, but they're really, really powerful.

384
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,818
Speaker 1: The sidekicks are all different too.

385
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:46,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you can do Luigi and Hammer Brothers, or Luigi and Koopa Troopas, or Luigi and toads.

386
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:52,380
Speaker 0: And it's all different, the toads are fast, the Burdos are really aggressive.

387
00:26:52,960 --> 00:27:00,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's really, no one has done a fact of exactly what the differences are yet, but it seems to be that the Burdos are good on general offense.

388
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,840
Speaker 1: The Hammer Brothers are real good at straight on headers.

389
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,398
Speaker 0: It seems that's what they're straight at.

390
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,920
Speaker 1: And I do notice one thing, the Hammer Brothers slide tackle is really long.

391
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,920
Speaker 0: It is, it is, I like that a lot.

392
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:19,480
Speaker 0: Like I started using the Hammer Brothers, and I basically used the slide tackle exclusively, except for the very rare case when I need to use the hard frickin' hit.

393
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:24,840
Speaker 1: Now in terms of the game itself, it's fantastic, and there's not much we can say other than that it's a fantastic game.

394
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,360
Speaker 1: It's one, two, three, or four player.

395
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:28,739
Speaker 1: You can do co-op, you can do three on one.

396
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,540
Speaker 0: That's one thing that's really good, is to unlock all the stuff, of course you have to play, you know, the one player tournament thing.

397
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:47,260
Speaker 0: And you can play, which Mario Tennis didn't allow you to do, because you had to play in Mario Tennis to unlock everything, the single player doubles, which meant it was you and a computer opponent versus two computer opponents.

398
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:57,160
Speaker 0: And it's very annoying to play that way and be forced to face incredibly difficult computer opponents when one of the people on your team is a computer controlled opponent.

399
00:27:58,221 --> 00:28:12,940
Speaker 0: In this, it allows you in the single player cup modes to have more than one person on a team, so you could actually play the one player game, well the tournament cup game, with four people on your team, all controlling a different character.

400
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,839
Speaker 1: Now another, aside from the gameplay, because there's not much more we can say about it, that's really it, and it's fun.

401
00:28:19,061 --> 00:28:20,280
Speaker 0: It's soccer, it's a lot of fun.

402
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:26,799
Speaker 1: But there's, like remember when Smash Brothers came out for the GameCube and there was so much color in the game and just little things.

403
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:34,139
Speaker 1: This game is chock full of that, every character has numerous animations of their reactions to everything that happens.

404
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:37,180
Speaker 0: You will get tired of them because there aren't really that many.

405
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,140
Speaker 1: But there's enough to where it's really high energy and they're really amusing.

406
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, some of them are really amusing.

407
00:28:43,881 --> 00:28:47,360
Speaker 1: Like Waluigi actually makes the "Suck My Dick" maneuver.

408
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,099
Speaker 1: He straight up points at his penis like he wants you to suck it.

409
00:28:51,444 --> 00:28:51,699
Speaker 0: Yeah.

410
00:28:52,548 --> 00:28:53,180
Speaker 1: It's hilarious.

411
00:28:53,542 --> 00:28:57,179
Speaker 0: Like Daisy licks her finger and touches her ass and it actually steams.

412
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,087
Speaker 1: And then she's like,

413
00:28:58,148 --> 00:28:58,372
Speaker 1: "Hot!".

414
00:28:59,001 --> 00:29:00,280
Speaker 1: Actually Daisy has my favorite one.

415
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:00,483
Speaker 0: She goes,

416
00:29:00,503 --> 00:29:00,726
Speaker 0: "Daisy!".

417
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:07,639
Speaker 1: Sometimes when she wins, or when she gets a shot off, she runs away, pumping her arms in the air, just yelling, "Yes!

418
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:07,969
Speaker 1: Yes!

419
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:08,442
Speaker 1: Yes!".

420
00:29:08,563 --> 00:29:10,200
Speaker 1: and it's just so natural and hilarious.

421
00:29:10,621 --> 00:29:15,192
Speaker 0: It's really hilarious because you have this semi-hot body with this weird Daisy head on it.

422
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:21,880
Speaker 1: I did read somewhere that, because someone actually mentioned in GameFacts how come the girls are wearing slightly skimpy outfits.

423
00:29:22,042 --> 00:29:23,879
Speaker 1: It's not the kind of thing you see in Nintendo games.

424
00:29:24,641 --> 00:29:29,977
Speaker 1: And I read, I haven't verified this, that another company designed the models and the stuff they wear.

425
00:29:31,344 --> 00:29:32,520
Speaker 1: I don't know, I didn't read much about it.

426
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like Next whatever games.

427
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:39,099
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they had a lot more say in the game than other companies that did similar games have had in the past.

428
00:29:39,242 --> 00:29:40,200
Speaker 1: Or they took more liberties.

429
00:29:41,283 --> 00:29:42,559
Speaker 1: I'm not sure about the details of that.

430
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:49,359
Speaker 0: Yeah, they definitely made the game, like if you think that Mario Tennis and Mario Golf are sort of like kiddie-ish, you know?

431
00:29:49,801 --> 00:29:50,296
Speaker 0: Who knew?

432
00:29:50,823 --> 00:29:51,057
Speaker 0: Yeah.

433
00:29:52,121 --> 00:29:58,180
Speaker 0: Mario Strikers is definitely geared towards a slightly more into it sports-only.

434
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,780
Speaker 0: Kind of like that, what was that basketball game for the GameCube that just happened to have Mario characters in it?

435
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:03,520
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, yeah.

436
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,420
Speaker 0: Like NBA Street something something.

437
00:30:06,122 --> 00:30:07,419
Speaker 0: It's definitely more like that.

438
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,117
Speaker 0: Like this isn't really super cartoony, happy, cute Nintendo.

439
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,360
Speaker 0: This is really like a street kind of style soccer.

440
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, like all those animations, those don't apply to just the main characters.

441
00:30:18,801 --> 00:30:25,537
Speaker 1: The Toads and the Koopas have them too, and they're all, I mean, sometimes a Toad will score a goal, and he runs away just like, "Yes, yes, yes, yes,

442
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:25,718
Speaker 1: yes!".

443
00:30:26,182 --> 00:30:27,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the Toads have evil eyes.

444
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,419
Speaker 0: Well, some of them do.

445
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,138
Speaker 0: Most of them do.

446
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,300
Speaker 0: Depends on the animation.

447
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:37,860
Speaker 0: Like, the Hammer Brother is the best, because what he does is he runs, and then he jumps and lands on his back and kind of slides like a turtle shell.

448
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,438
Speaker 0: Yeah, and pumpin'.

449
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:38,864
Speaker 1: He's like,

450
00:30:38,925 --> 00:30:39,389
Speaker 1: "Yeah!"

451
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:41,540
Speaker 1: And it's just fantastic.

452
00:30:42,325 --> 00:30:42,940
Speaker 0: It's really good.

453
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:47,880
Speaker 1: The game is extremely high energy and extremely, extremely immersive.

454
00:30:48,723 --> 00:30:50,099
Speaker 0: It's real fast-paced action.

455
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:57,740
Speaker 1: I mean, the music's just pumping the whole time, the music's pretty good, the sound effects are really well done, and really, the game pumps you up like a Eurobeat song would.

456
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:58,699
Speaker 0: Kinda, yeah.

457
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,200
Speaker 0: I mean, one of the problems with the game is that there really aren't enough arenas.

458
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,180
Speaker 0: Like at first, there's like three arenas available, so I unlocked the rest of them.

459
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,820
Speaker 0: I really only unlocked four more arenas for a total of seven.

460
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,960
Speaker 1: And they're not different enough for me to care at all.

461
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,438
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's really, I don't really care which arena it is, and they're kind of all the same.

462
00:31:18,401 --> 00:31:23,579
Speaker 0: Really, I like the, it's not like Smash Brothers, where the arena matters a lot and there's a lot of variety going on.

463
00:31:23,922 --> 00:31:24,680
Speaker 0: It's sort of boring.

464
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, it does seem that if this game had come out in the early days of the GameCube...

465
00:31:29,761 --> 00:31:30,520
Speaker 0: That would have been much better.

466
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,340
Speaker 1: ...they would have added a lot more to it, because they were really trying to impress people.

467
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:40,420
Speaker 1: And now, it seems like they could have done more with the game, but that doesn't really matter because the game as it stands is freaking badass.

468
00:31:41,022 --> 00:31:41,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's another thing.

469
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,560
Speaker 0: I would have liked more game modes.

470
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,559
Speaker 0: Like, you know, Mario Tennis, you can play tennis, you can play the coin, you can play the rings.

471
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:55,119
Speaker 1: But then again, I really don't like any of those other modes in Mario Tennis, and after playing them a few times, I was totally sick of them.

472
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,698
Speaker 1: And I only wanted to play the main game, so it seems like it was almost wasted effort.

473
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,620
Speaker 0: Eh, I like to play the other modes occasionally, you know.

474
00:32:01,661 --> 00:32:02,759
Speaker 1: I can't stand any of them.

475
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:03,594
Speaker 0: Oh, because sometimes...

476
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,520
Speaker 1: The only one I like at all is the Chain Chomp Bomb Water one.

477
00:32:07,806 --> 00:32:08,080
Speaker 1: At all.

478
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:08,819
Speaker 1: There's only one.

479
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,759
Speaker 0: There's those things, too.

480
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,780
Speaker 1: No, only that one.

481
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,519
Speaker 1: I hate the rest of them.

482
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,759
Speaker 0: Well, you hate the rest of them.

483
00:32:12,922 --> 00:32:13,213
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do.

484
00:32:13,621 --> 00:32:16,478
Speaker 0: I think that, you know, you have a game, and it only has one mode.

485
00:32:17,081 --> 00:32:18,600
Speaker 0: When that mode runs out, you're done.

486
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:24,100
Speaker 0: It's good to have other modes to fall back on, because you play those, and then the original mode becomes interesting again.

487
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,859
Speaker 1: But the Mario Tennis mode never ran out.

488
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,940
Speaker 1: I never got sick of that game.

489
00:32:27,582 --> 00:32:28,878
Speaker 0: Uh, you know, sometimes...

490
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,718
Speaker 1: I only got sick of playing it with all my friends who suck at it.

491
00:32:32,802 --> 00:32:35,639
Speaker 1: Even though they eventually all got pretty good.

492
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,020
Speaker 0: It just took a lot.

493
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:37,399
Speaker 0: Kinda good.

494
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:41,598
Speaker 1: Yeah, granted, it's not any great skill on our part, it's just that we played the game a lot more.

495
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,027
Speaker 0: Yeah.

496
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:43,040
Speaker 1: That's really all there is to it.

497
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,278
Speaker 0: Well, it is sort of a game of skill, but mostly it's...

498
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,200
Speaker 1: But you learn the skill so quickly by playing.

499
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:53,280
Speaker 0: It's a reflex memorization thing, you know, you can get the skill in your brain, you have to get it into the other part of your brain.

500
00:32:53,780 --> 00:33:04,240
Speaker 1: I highly recommend, as long as you don't live alone, that you buy this game ASAP, because you want to get as much enjoyment out of it as you can now, before the Wii and all these new DS games come out.

501
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,059
Speaker 0: Because then you're never going to look back at this game.

502
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:10,920
Speaker 1: Granted, there isn't going to be another Mario soccer game for a while on the Wii.

503
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:11,352
Speaker 1: Yeah.

504
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:19,780
Speaker 1: So this game will have a lot of staying power, but you're not going to want to play this game compared to all the crazy games that have come out for the Wii right away.

505
00:33:21,262 --> 00:33:23,260
Speaker 1: Plus, the game's not going to come down in price.

506
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,478
Speaker 1: So every day that you wait before you buy it is one day less of value.

507
00:33:27,498 --> 00:33:28,070
Speaker 1: you'll get out of it.

508
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:35,642
Speaker 0: Yeah, you might be able to get it on eBay for between $40 and $50, but you're going to get it at your EB or your GameStop for $50.

509
00:33:35,642 --> 00:33:38,120
Speaker 1: I think, I regret the fact that we didn't buy it sooner.

510
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:38,467
Speaker 0: Yeah.

511
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:44,180
Speaker 1: Because we would have paid the same if we'd bought it four months ago, and it would have been four more months of playing this game.

512
00:33:44,581 --> 00:33:48,360
Speaker 0: The game also just has a tournament mode, but it's just a tournament mode.

513
00:33:48,701 --> 00:33:53,040
Speaker 0: You set up tournaments of knockout style or whatever, and then you have a tournament!

514
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:54,437
Speaker 0: That's what it is.

515
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:59,351
Speaker 0: A lot of games have had that, I mean, there are really old games that had tournament modes in them.

516
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,780
Speaker 0: I mean, Tech Mobile had a tournament mode.

517
00:34:02,961 --> 00:34:03,437
Speaker 1: Yes, it did.

518
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:05,720
Speaker 0: So it's just not very exciting.

519
00:34:06,601 --> 00:34:08,458
Speaker 1: But I think that's enough about that.

520
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:13,572
Speaker 1: Bear in mind that tonight is the last normal episode of Geek Nights until two weeks from now.

521
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:18,780
Speaker 0: Well, not two weeks from now, two weeks from, uh, one week from Monday.

522
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:23,520
Speaker 1: The week, the Monday after, the Monday after Otacon.

523
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,560
Speaker 0: So not next Monday, the Monday after that.

524
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,018
Speaker 0: Two Mondays from now.

525
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:37,000
Speaker 1: So of course, tune in tomorrow for our Otacon pregame show, and tune in next week for the Geek Nights specials, which will be of varying quality.

526
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:38,418
Speaker 0: Yup.

527
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:48,170
Speaker 1: And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

528
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,809
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

Speaker 1: Geek Nights airs every weeknight, Monday through Thursday.

535
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:17,630
Speaker 0: Geek Nights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

536
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:21,510
Speaker 0: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
