1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:13,031
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday October 25th 2016.

2
00:00:13,031 --> 00:00:16,500
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,386
Speaker 1: We are back.

4
00:00:17,487 --> 00:00:20,332
Speaker 1: We're bad and it's time to talk about civilization.

5
00:00:20,332 --> 00:00:22,941
Speaker 1: 6.

6
00:00:22,941 --> 00:00:23,977
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:31,940
Speaker 1: So yeah, I was as I said in Australia for a couple weeks on a trip to a much less fun convention than packs.

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,606
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know you're in Australia.

9
00:00:33,627 --> 00:00:34,912
Speaker 0: It was warm here.

10
00:00:34,972 --> 00:00:40,820
Speaker 1: now as soon as you get back woman's cold Yep, but the one thing that's going for me is the back wall.

11
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:45,880
Speaker 1: I don't need you know what's going on in Australia like the height of spring.

12
00:00:46,382 --> 00:00:50,520
Speaker 1: So Sydney smelled like nothing but flowers like it was just amazing there.

13
00:00:51,382 --> 00:00:53,055
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was smelled pretty good here too.

14
00:00:53,115 --> 00:00:56,716
Speaker 0: The Sun was out It was like 70 80 degrees and then you got back and now it's 50 40 degrees.

15
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:08,940
Speaker 1: yeah, but basically I got two Springs and I got to my mountain biking and like all the biz and then I had to Home because I couldn't justify staying in Australia for two more weeks just to go to packs.

16
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:16,052
Speaker 1: Why not cuz I had shit to do like in my real life Never mind work stuff, and I didn't want to blow two weeks of vacation.

17
00:01:16,072 --> 00:01:17,477
Speaker 1: I only get 25 days of vacation.

18
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,345
Speaker 1: I don't want to blow at all.

19
00:01:19,365 --> 00:01:19,867
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

20
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,400
Speaker 1: So yeah, I'm back and I'm missing packs off.

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:31,579
Speaker 1: So I think what I think my plan I don't know if you want to do it or not is just I'll start starting next year I'll go back to packs off and I'm gonna try to go every other year.

22
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:33,482
Speaker 1: 2018.

23
00:01:33,482 --> 00:01:36,733
Speaker 0: we already decided we're gonna go to essence and in 2018.

24
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:38,780
Speaker 1: We also decided we're gonna start our own con.

25
00:01:39,881 --> 00:01:40,364
Speaker 0: Yeah, sure.

26
00:01:40,484 --> 00:01:41,409
Speaker 1: Yeah February though.

27
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,972
Speaker 1: That's that doesn't.

28
00:01:41,992 --> 00:01:43,540
Speaker 1: that's literally not in the way of anything.

29
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,045
Speaker 1: We do better get started right now.

30
00:01:45,446 --> 00:01:46,710
Speaker 1: I've been working on it.

31
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:47,172
Speaker 1: Actually.

32
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:49,580
Speaker 1: I've been talking to people working on the find a place.

33
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:53,154
Speaker 0: Then we the rest of the work is that place in Brooklyn's looking pretty good.

34
00:01:53,254 --> 00:01:55,444
Speaker 0: Actually, I thought you said they didn't pick up The phone they did.

35
00:01:55,504 --> 00:01:56,710
Speaker 1: now they actually got back to me.

36
00:01:56,931 --> 00:01:58,660
Speaker 1: Okay, I got some initial talkings.

37
00:01:59,123 --> 00:02:06,766
Speaker 0: I'm trying to get an indicative quote Which is the only thing table rental or they gonna call someone else because all I really need is Tables and then maybe AV rental.

38
00:02:07,107 --> 00:02:11,820
Speaker 1: Yep tables AV and maybe like a couple of screens and things like that comes from the AV rent?

39
00:02:11,981 --> 00:02:12,704
Speaker 1: No, no, not not.

40
00:02:12,905 --> 00:02:16,340
Speaker 1: projection screens blocking one area off from another area screens.

41
00:02:17,823 --> 00:02:19,168
Speaker 1: You don't want just one big room.

42
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:20,072
Speaker 1: That's all that always feels.

43
00:02:20,092 --> 00:02:22,100
Speaker 0: remember that usually comes at the table rental.

44
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,405
Speaker 1: Remember anime next.

45
00:02:23,445 --> 00:02:26,978
Speaker 1: how weird it felt was just big one giant open room of nonsense.

46
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:30,036
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm sure they have dividers built into the walls also.

47
00:02:30,056 --> 00:02:32,320
Speaker 1: Yeah So anyway, that's all that's all going good.

48
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,618
Speaker 1: But we're finally back and we got to be real careful not to blow our entire load of new stuff.

49
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:38,180
Speaker 0: That's all right.

50
00:02:38,401 --> 00:02:38,662
Speaker 0: We don't.

51
00:02:38,763 --> 00:02:41,073
Speaker 0: usually you know, I look I thought back and I look back.

52
00:02:41,414 --> 00:02:42,620
Speaker 0: We don't blow our load of stuff.

53
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,560
Speaker 0: What happens is we forget stuff just forget everything.

54
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,174
Speaker 0: So the first time we do a show we have things you remembered, you know from like.

55
00:02:49,535 --> 00:02:56,762
Speaker 0: like you can only remember a few days Back, so right now we haven't done a show but I can remember more of my life than a few days back Like something.

56
00:02:56,802 --> 00:03:00,712
Speaker 0: we something that happened like two days after the last show.

57
00:03:00,752 --> 00:03:01,735
Speaker 0: we did like.

58
00:03:01,955 --> 00:03:03,740
Speaker 0: there's probably something great and we just forgot it.

59
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:12,118
Speaker 1: well The most reliable way to ensure that we don't do a show on something is for one of us to say that's a great idea for the next n-day show.

60
00:03:13,482 --> 00:03:16,836
Speaker 1: That guarantees we will not talk about it for at least two or three years.

61
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:17,680
Speaker 0: write it down.

62
00:03:19,021 --> 00:03:25,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got a Google Keep and the only good idea we've got that we have definitely not forgotten is one that requires some work.

63
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,905
Speaker 1: So we haven't done it yet.

64
00:03:25,926 --> 00:03:26,772
Speaker 1: You know what that idea was.

65
00:03:26,812 --> 00:03:27,659
Speaker 1: It's a Thursday idea.

66
00:03:28,701 --> 00:03:31,028
Speaker 1: Things of the day the all things of the day show.

67
00:03:31,369 --> 00:03:35,522
Speaker 1: the best of the plan is will each come to the table with our Ten?

68
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:41,770
Speaker 1: from all the things it has to be the rule is has to be a thing of the day that you yourself Used on a previous geek night.

69
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,620
Speaker 0: that's still around that still exists.

70
00:03:44,222 --> 00:03:47,494
Speaker 1: And then but if the link is broken, but you find it again, that's okay.

71
00:03:47,534 --> 00:03:52,266
Speaker 1: Like the tapestry generator is up again In fact, it keeps going down.

72
00:03:52,366 --> 00:04:01,279
Speaker 1: and whenever it comes back the video of our beyond D&D panel where we lamented that it's gone People keep commenting there linking to when it comes back.

73
00:04:02,147 --> 00:04:03,319
Speaker 1: So that is how I keep finding it.

74
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:14,298
Speaker 1: So in the tiniest news and relevant to my trip One thing I did on the trip is cuz at my laptop is I played an entire game of Civ 5 on One of the flights like start to finish.

75
00:04:15,182 --> 00:04:17,810
Speaker 1: No one of course against the AI is like I always do.

76
00:04:18,151 --> 00:04:20,517
Speaker 0: and the hardest difficulty no fuck deity mode.

77
00:04:20,538 --> 00:04:22,082
Speaker 1: It's not fun Emperor.

78
00:04:22,603 --> 00:04:23,907
Speaker 1: it's yeah, I play.

79
00:04:23,947 --> 00:04:27,556
Speaker 1: I pretty much always play King or Emperor depending on what kind of game I'm looking for.

80
00:04:27,576 --> 00:04:30,903
Speaker 0: I can win King Rarely, really.

81
00:04:30,923 --> 00:04:33,891
Speaker 1: I win King a hundred percent of the time no matter what like.

82
00:04:33,931 --> 00:04:34,975
Speaker 1: it's not even a question of.

83
00:04:35,677 --> 00:04:40,179
Speaker 1: the question is only Which sieve do I pick and how do I choose to win?

84
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,626
Speaker 1: Assuming eight player continents normal speed Emperor I win about.

85
00:04:46,646 --> 00:04:52,451
Speaker 1: I want to say 45 percent of the time Unless I play one of my go-to saves like Portugal agrees.

86
00:04:52,852 --> 00:04:53,956
Speaker 0: I don't know if I could win ever.

87
00:04:53,996 --> 00:04:59,380
Speaker 0: I'd have to like try But yeah I'm like afraid to try it cuz like I'll just get killed right away.

88
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:13,960
Speaker 1: It sucks because the AI just gets crazy cheat and the only way to win at all is to hyper optimize like you're literally like optimizing for Individual great people and calculating how many turns they'll take for you to get them and that kind of nonsense

89
00:05:14,341 --> 00:05:14,542
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm,

90
00:05:15,163 --> 00:05:17,310
Speaker 1: so but we'll get to that because I played.

91
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:19,837
Speaker 1: basically I am like peeking my sieve.

92
00:05:19,898 --> 00:05:23,315
Speaker 1: five play Just as sieve six came out.

93
00:05:23,858 --> 00:05:35,700
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I've got three remaining giant multiplayer robot games going opposite five And I think that big game is to five that I played against the AI's on the flights Will be my last single players to five game.

94
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:42,199
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna run out all my sieve five GM ours because they're all really good and After that ends that's gonna be the end of it.

95
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:58,017
Speaker 1: But my news is that there was a tweet from the giant multiplayer robot People saying that initial testing against the civilization six hot seat save file Confirms that they will very likely be able to provide the exact same service for sieve six.

96
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:58,780
Speaker 0: That's good.

97
00:05:59,101 --> 00:06:08,160
Speaker 1: That's real good because the initial reports I've not tried it yet of Because we did not test this so we can't talk about it in our actual show on sieve six.

98
00:06:08,482 --> 00:06:15,335
Speaker 1: so it coats in the news section of the show is That it works fine in that it works as well as the sieve five.

99
00:06:15,516 --> 00:06:22,687
Speaker 1: one should have worked meaning It doesn't just crash like it did in sieve five like it actually works But it's still not good.

100
00:06:23,088 --> 00:06:31,732
Speaker 1: sieve has never had good multiplayer and giant multiplayer robot is the only way to reliably play Asynchronous multiplayer of a civilization game in the world.

101
00:06:32,255 --> 00:06:33,300
Speaker 1: It's pretty much the only way to do it.

102
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:42,480
Speaker 1: So my news is I will be able to continue doing it as soon as it is stable And I know enough about sieve six to not be a dumb moron at it.

103
00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:47,740
Speaker 1: I think I'm gonna start a sieve six giant multiplayer robot game, and we'll all play it together.

104
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,880
Speaker 0: I think the one problem with all sieves, but it's you know.

105
00:06:51,282 --> 00:07:03,259
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's better or worse in sieve six But is that there are certain things in sieve six like that you can build or do and the bonus for doing them Is that it curries you favor with or against?

106
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,010
Speaker 0: the AI opponents yeah get right.

107
00:07:07,532 --> 00:07:16,264
Speaker 1: so the problem with sieve five is that the the Diplomacy against a eyes was just like you could just game it heavily Right and now.

108
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:30,610
Speaker 0: so for example in sieve six you might want to like put a bunch of Envoys to a particular city-state, but if another empire has a bunch of envoys there And you out envoy them they get pissed and it's like the penalty for doing that.

109
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:33,980
Speaker 0: yeah against real people that penalty is gone.

110
00:07:34,565 --> 00:07:36,480
Speaker 0: And I guess the balance of the game.

111
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:43,754
Speaker 0: They don't change the rules when you're playing multiplayer for a single and they need to Account for the fact that there are no a eyes involved.

112
00:07:43,794 --> 00:07:45,080
Speaker 1: so having played it's interesting.

113
00:07:45,241 --> 00:08:00,716
Speaker 1: We'll get to it in the main show, but having played a lot of multiplayer sieve five and sieve four and also having played a lot of single-player the Sieve six is has a lot more ways to interact with the a eyes like way way way more

114
00:08:00,776 --> 00:08:01,317
Speaker 0: tons more

115
00:08:01,378 --> 00:08:06,817
Speaker 1: and they're so Integral to the game that I don't know how that's gonna play out.

116
00:08:06,897 --> 00:08:07,219
Speaker 1: actually.

117
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:10,659
Speaker 0: yeah I mean there are sieves that got mad at me because I chose a different government than them.

118
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:16,403
Speaker 0: right But if you're playing multiplayer, and I choose monarchy, and you choose something else you don't give a fuck that I chose mine I think.

119
00:08:16,604 --> 00:08:29,347
Speaker 1: ah but in sieve five when the Ideologies come out you care a lot because if other people like say someone picks your ideology versus someone else's that could alter the balance Of tourism output and really fuck you.

120
00:08:29,688 --> 00:08:36,897
Speaker 1: so choosing an ideology if you're not one of the people who really starts one is Actually a really big deal mechanically, but you know.

121
00:08:38,224 --> 00:08:41,900
Speaker 1: Anyway, like I literally have already threatened a specific person.

122
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,010
Speaker 0: Let's talk about some knots of sieve five.

123
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,015
Speaker 1: I'm playing where.

124
00:08:46,035 --> 00:08:50,274
Speaker 1: if they don't choose my ideology I'm going to immediately declare war on them, so let's talk about some non sieve.

125
00:08:50,314 --> 00:08:53,719
Speaker 0: so this game came out Called really bad chess.

126
00:08:55,262 --> 00:08:57,520
Speaker 0: It's for I don't know if it's for other mobile platform.

127
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:06,063
Speaker 1: I start I've really bad at shit into Google and the first thing I recommended was really bad chest pain Really bad.

128
00:09:06,104 --> 00:09:07,048
Speaker 0: chess is on iOS.

129
00:09:07,068 --> 00:09:08,113
Speaker 0: I don't know what else it's on.

130
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:17,806
Speaker 0: I'm sure it's on something else And basically it's chess and there's like a daily board and a weekly board and you can just play ranked mode And you I don't know if you can play multiplayer.

131
00:09:17,846 --> 00:09:19,411
Speaker 0: Maybe looks like it's only iOS.

132
00:09:19,732 --> 00:09:19,853
Speaker 0: Okay.

133
00:09:19,873 --> 00:09:21,899
Speaker 0: That's a shame for anyone who has bad phone.

134
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:33,217
Speaker 0: So the thing really bad chess is that it just gives you random pieces in your front and back row And it also gives the other guy random pieces in the front and back row.

135
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,266
Speaker 1: oh my god I'm looking at the board on their page.

136
00:09:35,387 --> 00:09:38,180
Speaker 1: white has one two three four queens down there.

137
00:09:38,441 --> 00:09:39,885
Speaker 1: Yeah, all night you all.

138
00:09:40,025 --> 00:09:43,255
Speaker 0: I mean sometimes sometimes you always have one king.

139
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:44,740
Speaker 0: the whole top row is Knights.

140
00:09:44,962 --> 00:09:45,972
Speaker 0: You always have one king.

141
00:09:45,992 --> 00:09:46,820
Speaker 0: you know what else is Knights?

142
00:09:47,961 --> 00:09:57,920
Speaker 0: Two more people yeah, so I mean you know you ten nights You always have one king in the back row, but you know it's really crazy even crazier.

143
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,928
Speaker 0: They're just having a ton of Queens or stuff like that.

144
00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:06,129
Speaker 0: Yeah having pawns in the back row Pawn starting in the back row is fucking great.

145
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:07,194
Speaker 1: Do they get to move?

146
00:10:07,615 --> 00:10:08,640
Speaker 1: can they move two or three?

147
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,465
Speaker 1: How does that work?

148
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,359
Speaker 0: I'd haven't been able to get someone out of their way.

149
00:10:12,824 --> 00:10:14,233
Speaker 1: Can I on pass on from back there?

150
00:10:14,274 --> 00:10:15,099
Speaker 1: cuz that could be pretty good.

151
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:16,765
Speaker 0: I think you might be able to.

152
00:10:16,785 --> 00:10:17,688
Speaker 0: I don't know.

153
00:10:17,748 --> 00:10:18,531
Speaker 0: it's pretty crazy.

154
00:10:18,571 --> 00:10:21,159
Speaker 0: I really want to play this right, so it's pretty good.

155
00:10:22,045 --> 00:10:26,288
Speaker 0: The thing is it's really bad And I'm really bad at it.

156
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:29,600
Speaker 0: like my rank is just keep going down like they'll be boards.

157
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:40,896
Speaker 0: I've got like five Queens, and the other guys got maybe some bishops and Knights, and I lose like I can't No, it's interesting or like I'll move one piece and it like check and like what the fuck cuz like.

158
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:45,400
Speaker 0: I can't see everything That's going on cuz I got too much shit, so think about fairy chests.

159
00:10:45,461 --> 00:10:46,091
Speaker 1: That's the same thing.

160
00:10:46,152 --> 00:10:51,080
Speaker 1: chess masters They want an interesting game will change the rules of chess so that all the patterns and all the right.

161
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,070
Speaker 0: But they just shuffle up the pieces.

162
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:54,618
Speaker 0: They don't bring out eight Queens.

163
00:10:54,639 --> 00:11:00,813
Speaker 1: I Feel like being better at chess like really better just not you were.

164
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:05,724
Speaker 0: so it's not going to help you with this because in Real chests if you're good at it You've memorized patterns.

165
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:13,334
Speaker 0: and here there's no patterns to memorize all you can what all you can do in This is evaluate moves individually like all right.

166
00:11:13,434 --> 00:11:18,232
Speaker 0: I'll move that knight there Then he'll kill it then I'll kill that and he'll kill that right.

167
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:23,869
Speaker 0: you're on that level again that beginner level And you can't if you can think more than three moves ahead.

168
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:28,200
Speaker 0: in this you are a genius level or too much effort level.

169
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:34,332
Speaker 1: so Anecdotally when I was in high school I knew someone a kid who was a legit like chess master.

170
00:11:34,352 --> 00:11:36,440
Speaker 1: like he was like super pro at chess.

171
00:11:36,702 --> 00:11:39,160
Speaker 1: He played in real tournaments and no one to play chess.

172
00:11:39,301 --> 00:11:41,068
Speaker 1: I would always play chess with him because no one else would.

173
00:11:41,088 --> 00:11:44,355
Speaker 1: I never beat him ever like and I never even came close to beating him.

174
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:57,820
Speaker 1: But what would reliably happen is that he would take a bunch of my pieces and once I was kind of crippled I could hold out or press him pretty well for a surprisingly long time.

175
00:11:58,323 --> 00:12:07,360
Speaker 1: Once you have less pieces, it's easier to figure out what the fuck to do Exactly, I could start calculating out and also he would tell me several times that I did something dumb and weird.

176
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:13,860
Speaker 1: But it was so dumb and weird that he wasn't actually sure how to deal with it so until he got the game back into a normal state.

177
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,800
Speaker 0: Right, so it's like he thought about three moves ahead But you made a weird move and now everything he thought about ahead of time is gone.

178
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, now the move was to start from scratch again.

179
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:32,900
Speaker 1: The move was always still bad like I did something bad for me reliably But it would take him a while to figure out why it was bad Like what he could do to make it worse for me and end the game.

180
00:12:33,561 --> 00:12:34,680
Speaker 1: So, I don't know.

181
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,716
Speaker 1: I don't know if I'll be good or bad at this because I'm worse at chess than you.

182
00:12:37,736 --> 00:12:38,560
Speaker 1: with a few times we play.

183
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,083
Speaker 1: I don't think I ever.

184
00:12:39,143 --> 00:12:40,591
Speaker 1: I'd only beat you like once or twice ever.

185
00:12:40,611 --> 00:12:41,154
Speaker 0: I'm real.

186
00:12:41,174 --> 00:12:42,300
Speaker 0: I'm really bad at this.

187
00:12:42,582 --> 00:12:43,548
Speaker 1: I'm not good at chess.

188
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,212
Speaker 1: We'll see.

189
00:12:44,273 --> 00:12:45,219
Speaker 1: we should play this together.

190
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,726
Speaker 0: I don't know if we can.

191
00:12:46,787 --> 00:12:48,035
Speaker 1: I guess it's just a I we could.

192
00:12:48,095 --> 00:12:51,874
Speaker 1: we could Roll dice and randomize a chess board and play a game.

193
00:12:51,954 --> 00:12:53,140
Speaker 0: Oh, you can't play it on my iPad.

194
00:12:53,582 --> 00:12:56,594
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm getting an iPad soon the new iPad Pro.

195
00:12:56,634 --> 00:12:59,347
Speaker 1: well like whatever the next iPad comes out up I just get one early next year.

196
00:12:59,508 --> 00:13:01,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, I need an iDevice of some kind.

197
00:13:03,381 --> 00:13:13,380
Speaker 1: So yeah in other news probably the biggest gaming news, and we'll probably be doing a whole show about this once It's out and there's more details, but Nintendo switch was announced.

198
00:13:15,342 --> 00:13:23,110
Speaker 1: Everyone already realized that the controller looks like a puppy yeah like a puppy face Two seconds after the video came out.

199
00:13:23,711 --> 00:13:24,574
Speaker 1: uh I don't know.

200
00:13:25,035 --> 00:13:30,215
Speaker 1: I'm both excited and Disdainful and they cancel out to me.

201
00:13:30,255 --> 00:13:42,279
Speaker 0: being ambivalent I mean look I didn't get a Wii U, but not getting a Wii U. I didn't miss much where there was the height of Mario maker, which was Mario maker is coming out for 3ds.

202
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:43,575
Speaker 0: I already pre-ordered it.

203
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,867
Speaker 0: Yeah, but this holiday season is coming.

204
00:13:45,887 --> 00:13:48,737
Speaker 1: I feel like the fervor in the hype and like the 3ds isn't dead.

205
00:13:48,757 --> 00:13:51,497
Speaker 0: you still got Pokemon And you got Mario maker coming out for 3ds.

206
00:13:52,141 --> 00:13:57,279
Speaker 1: I feel like Mario maker is not at like people people who already played it or done with it because it turned into.

207
00:13:57,299 --> 00:14:02,237
Speaker 1: the only Thing anyone cares about now is crazy kaizo or automation maps like no one cares.

208
00:14:02,277 --> 00:14:03,000
Speaker 0: I don't care about that.

209
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,839
Speaker 0: I'm gonna make Mario levels, and I don't need anyone else to you know.

210
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,860
Speaker 1: I think I think that'll be fun for about a month, and then you'll never touch it again.

211
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,160
Speaker 0: I mean what DS 3ds game do I play for more than a month?

212
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,053
Speaker 0: That's advanced wars for the regular DS month is pretty good.

213
00:14:14,073 --> 00:14:18,139
Speaker 1: Yeah Splatoon I feel like is also a ship that has sailed.

214
00:14:19,121 --> 00:14:27,359
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, it's whatever right, but the point is is that There was like no Zelda game for the Wii U.

215
00:14:28,343 --> 00:14:37,292
Speaker 1: I have not enjoyed most Zelda games that have come out since I've played every real Zelda game there is.

216
00:14:37,312 --> 00:14:38,820
Speaker 1: I didn't even finish Twilight Princess.

217
00:14:39,001 --> 00:14:39,887
Speaker 1: I kind of got bored with it.

218
00:14:40,048 --> 00:14:47,580
Speaker 0: the point is I was right to skip the Wii U And I'm gonna get me some NX and play some Nintendo games, and you know that's how I do.

219
00:14:47,941 --> 00:14:48,986
Speaker 1: I don't know if I will like.

220
00:14:49,046 --> 00:14:52,601
Speaker 1: if I do I mean, I don't know the things I like.

221
00:14:52,621 --> 00:15:03,139
Speaker 1: the things I have liked about Nintendo franchises in recent memory are Maybe one Zelda game on a portable console replaying old advanced wars.

222
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:16,079
Speaker 0: I'm saying is that if you bring you know your 3ds to you know say PAX And you're sitting in line right you got to get everyone with the wireless shit, and you don't have the game.

223
00:15:16,381 --> 00:15:20,820
Speaker 1: The problem was that was so easy except at an actual gaming convention.

224
00:15:20,901 --> 00:15:22,894
Speaker 1: It never worked because of all the Wi-Fi interference.

225
00:15:22,934 --> 00:15:33,339
Speaker 1: right and to No one would ever play smash with me because most of you suck at it and didn't want to get beaten by me And the few of us who are good at it didn't want to play with me because they would just crush me.

226
00:15:33,681 --> 00:15:34,885
Speaker 1: And now I play smash.

227
00:15:34,966 --> 00:15:41,909
Speaker 0: so now what we'll do is we'll take the switch put it on the floor And just hand out little controllers and everyone play.

228
00:15:42,632 --> 00:15:43,595
Speaker 1: I don't think that'll happen.

229
00:15:44,056 --> 00:15:45,060
Speaker 0: I think that's definitely gonna happen.

230
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:45,582
Speaker 1: I think it'll.

231
00:15:45,622 --> 00:15:50,540
Speaker 0: I think we actually have a problem because PAX East is like right after the switch comes out.

232
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,564
Speaker 0: It's like they're easy.

233
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:55,440
Speaker 0: the same month is that at PAX East you're gonna have too many switches.

234
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:01,414
Speaker 0: It's gonna be like everyone's gonna put their switch down and you're gonna be like Sitting in line like you know.

235
00:16:01,434 --> 00:16:02,160
Speaker 0: these switches everywhere.

236
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:08,257
Speaker 1: I guess I'm honestly just not that confident in Nintendo's first party games being that good on it like.

237
00:16:08,297 --> 00:16:09,199
Speaker 1: that's my biggest worry.

238
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,613
Speaker 1: Hmm like nay, what's what's a really good recent first-party game that you would play?

239
00:16:15,653 --> 00:16:20,235
Speaker 1: not that was generally popular, but that you would have liked Mario maker all right.

240
00:16:21,362 --> 00:16:23,791
Speaker 1: How long got any more anything else?

241
00:16:24,293 --> 00:16:25,558
Speaker 0: I mean, that's why I skipped the Wii U.

242
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,653
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm just not that confident in those first party game development anymore.

243
00:16:30,714 --> 00:16:32,280
Speaker 1: I'm coming to appeal to someone like me.

244
00:16:32,521 --> 00:16:40,539
Speaker 0: I guess I'm confident that all the shit that was not on the Wii U Right has been being held back and is gonna come out on the switch.

245
00:16:40,901 --> 00:16:43,653
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean like Mario Kart on the Wii U.

246
00:16:43,673 --> 00:16:45,100
Speaker 0: They're gonna come out with a paper Mario.

247
00:16:45,461 --> 00:16:52,867
Speaker 1: I played it a lot actually and I played it just on other people's we use and I played it in Comparison to the 3ds one and the 3ds one.

248
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:57,079
Speaker 1: I think is actually objectively just a better Mario card if not for the snaking.

249
00:16:57,825 --> 00:17:01,109
Speaker 1: There's no the 3ds one Yeah, not the DS one.

250
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:03,860
Speaker 0: I mean yeah the portable games.

251
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,555
Speaker 0: I've always been more on with the portable Nintendo games.

252
00:17:06,635 --> 00:17:10,789
Speaker 1: right and remember Mario Literally ruined like it's only Nintendo.

253
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:13,460
Speaker 0: There's a list of Nintendo systems that I have owned ready.

254
00:17:14,123 --> 00:17:17,660
Speaker 0: I know an NES a game you've been a wee which are three console.

255
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,952
Speaker 1: Well, you didn't notice any s and you own one.

256
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,419
Speaker 1: No really yeah.

257
00:17:22,722 --> 00:17:28,913
Speaker 0: But I owned a Game Boy Color a GBA Ds a three right every single.

258
00:17:29,295 --> 00:17:31,243
Speaker 0: you know handheld Right.

259
00:17:31,344 --> 00:17:36,200
Speaker 1: see I skipped the Game Boy Color, but I had a Game Boy and a Game Gear, and then my next one was the GBA.

260
00:17:37,301 --> 00:17:41,573
Speaker 0: My brother had the Game Boy, and then I got the Game Boy Color.

261
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,278
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's when I had money.

262
00:17:43,740 --> 00:18:04,260
Speaker 1: yeah We'll see I'm just I'm not that excited about it Especially because a lot of the initial marketing in the initial discussions was talking about again all this like set-top box HTTPS Functionality which from a Nintendo console means it'll be way shittier than any other option in that regard.

263
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:06,069
Speaker 0: I mean, I have an HTTPS.

264
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,020
Speaker 0: I don't need any of that exactly nor all that.

265
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,449
Speaker 1: It worries me that they even talk about it like.

266
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:13,320
Speaker 1: I feel like Nintendo in this modern era.

267
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,910
Speaker 1: It needs to give up on that ship like that ship.

268
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:17,537
Speaker 1: It's not that it's sailed.

269
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,380
Speaker 1: It's that it's sinking.

270
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,989
Speaker 0: No, the reason he's the reason you don't give up on that ship.

271
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:24,420
Speaker 1: right because no Nintendo will never make one that floats.

272
00:18:24,862 --> 00:18:26,229
Speaker 1: They're incapable of doing it.

273
00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:28,118
Speaker 0: it doesn't have to flow just has to do something right.

274
00:18:28,178 --> 00:18:39,320
Speaker 0: because You're thinking like oh someone's got this big home entertainment center And you think they're gonna choose the switch over like their Roku or their cable box or their actual HDBC.

275
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,447
Speaker 0: It's like no no they're not gonna do that right.

276
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:49,534
Speaker 0: the reason you put those features on there is because up in the kids bedroom Where the switch is right there ain't no Roku in there right.

277
00:18:49,554 --> 00:18:50,437
Speaker 0: there ain't no HDBC.

278
00:18:50,578 --> 00:18:53,124
Speaker 1: in there The kids bedroom.

279
00:18:53,345 --> 00:19:00,475
Speaker 1: he probably doesn't even have a TV or he probably just has his portable stuff and Not even a computer because kids don't use them anymore.

280
00:19:00,495 --> 00:19:01,139
Speaker 1: He's got a tablet.

281
00:19:01,903 --> 00:19:03,348
Speaker 0: I think you're just detached from.

282
00:19:03,369 --> 00:19:06,160
Speaker 0: you know suburban family house life?

283
00:19:06,481 --> 00:19:06,902
Speaker 1: I don't know.

284
00:19:07,364 --> 00:19:09,090
Speaker 1: we gotta ask them to suburban house people.

285
00:19:09,472 --> 00:19:13,425
Speaker 0: pretty sure once your kid is old enough to have a Nintendo switch They got a TV in their room.

286
00:19:13,646 --> 00:19:19,859
Speaker 1: my sample size is messed up because most of the people I know Who live that lifestyle are?

287
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:24,579
Speaker 1: The HD PC types who know better mm-hmm, so I don't know.

288
00:19:25,382 --> 00:19:29,600
Speaker 0: Also, they don't have children old enough to or they don't have children or have children.

289
00:19:30,383 --> 00:19:31,046
Speaker 1: Here's a problem.

290
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:33,919
Speaker 1: those people right that you described those people.

291
00:19:33,979 --> 00:19:36,670
Speaker 1: yeah They have more than one kid.

292
00:19:36,951 --> 00:19:38,979
Speaker 1: which kids bedroom does the switch sit in?

293
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,384
Speaker 0: Hopefully you know neither one.

294
00:19:41,445 --> 00:19:45,680
Speaker 1: it's gonna have to sit in the living room or the den because the family room.

295
00:19:45,942 --> 00:19:47,460
Speaker 0: Maybe you get two docks moved around.

296
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:56,038
Speaker 0: Oh If you're rich enough Kids have their own bedrooms, maybe you can be rich enough that they have their own switches.

297
00:19:56,058 --> 00:20:00,960
Speaker 0: no Go, I don't think your kids are in the same bedroom because you're not rich.

298
00:20:01,682 --> 00:20:06,959
Speaker 1: I feel like the people who on average have two bedrooms because that's actually pretty easy to do in modern suburbia.

299
00:20:07,441 --> 00:20:10,500
Speaker 0: They're still not going to switch a room cost a lot more than a video.

300
00:20:10,701 --> 00:20:12,510
Speaker 1: No, I didn't modern houses got.

301
00:20:12,952 --> 00:20:14,500
Speaker 1: if you have you have a four corner house.

302
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,268
Speaker 1: They're almost all two bedroom now.

303
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:18,197
Speaker 1: well two bedroom plus master bedroom.

304
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,719
Speaker 0: so three bedroom I mean a game console cost less than a room.

305
00:20:22,101 --> 00:20:29,620
Speaker 1: I feel like the kinds of people who are even gonna buy a Nintendo switch and live in suburbia have two bedrooms plus master bedroom.

306
00:20:30,282 --> 00:20:31,226
Speaker 1: I feel like that's the thing.

307
00:20:31,587 --> 00:20:37,467
Speaker 1: people who only have one bedroom and two kids one bedroom for two kids Probably not buying a new game console.

308
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:41,488
Speaker 0: point is it might as well add HD PC features.

309
00:20:41,569 --> 00:20:42,233
Speaker 0: it's a computer.

310
00:20:42,354 --> 00:20:43,219
Speaker 0: everything is a computer.

311
00:20:44,502 --> 00:20:48,980
Speaker 1: Watching Netflix like I watch I've seen people try to watch Netflix on a Wii.

312
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:50,989
Speaker 1: Didn't was not great.

313
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,316
Speaker 0: No a lot of reasons.

314
00:20:52,336 --> 00:21:01,191
Speaker 1: It's not great But anyway things of the day.

315
00:21:01,211 --> 00:21:03,398
Speaker 1: so Scott you remember the bear in the shinin.

316
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:10,391
Speaker 1: No Really the one of the weirdest most unexplained scenes in The Shining.

317
00:21:10,411 --> 00:21:19,340
Speaker 0: I mean I don't remember every scene for that movie Where he's talked like the ghost bartender, and there's the scene where he cuts through the door with the eggs.

318
00:21:20,101 --> 00:21:24,160
Speaker 1: So remember when cuz the wife like never sees the the monsters, right?

319
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,104
Speaker 1: It's like the kid sees the ghosts and the dad sees the ghost But she doesn't right.

320
00:21:28,605 --> 00:21:42,720
Speaker 1: so there's one ghost that she sees at one point when she's running away from him And she looks in this door And there's the good-looking rich old guy getting sucked off by a fat older guy in a bear costume with his butt hanging out.

321
00:21:43,362 --> 00:21:44,346
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm you remember that?

322
00:21:44,606 --> 00:21:45,851
Speaker 0: no you really don't remember that.

323
00:21:46,152 --> 00:21:47,758
Speaker 1: no I'll try to find a screenshot of it.

324
00:21:47,778 --> 00:21:48,200
Speaker 1: this scene.

325
00:21:49,025 --> 00:21:52,174
Speaker 0: I don't see it because your head is in the way right there.

326
00:21:53,147 --> 00:21:55,073
Speaker 1: bear guy Remember that?

327
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:02,046
Speaker 1: He was getting a blowjob barely Vaguely.

328
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:09,679
Speaker 1: so Apparently cuz I never thought about this scene other than scary ghost like something something because I hadn't read the book.

329
00:22:10,905 --> 00:22:12,220
Speaker 1: I've actually never read the book nope.

330
00:22:12,981 --> 00:22:14,747
Speaker 0: So in the make it make it your book club thing.

331
00:22:14,827 --> 00:22:22,920
Speaker 1: so this is a scene that was in the book But in the book it was different and the dude was wearing a dog costume.

332
00:22:23,462 --> 00:22:24,807
Speaker 0: Maybe they just didn't have a dog costume?

333
00:22:24,847 --> 00:22:27,537
Speaker 1: no so Kubrick would bait like.

334
00:22:27,577 --> 00:22:41,560
Speaker 1: it was crazy Crazy attentive to that kind of detail and as many people have pointed out over the years He would never have made that mistake if he included an unexplained scene from the book Without giving all the other scenes that give it context in the movie.

335
00:22:41,881 --> 00:22:44,755
Speaker 1: He would not have fucked up and made it a bear by accident mm-hmm.

336
00:22:44,795 --> 00:22:48,460
Speaker 1: so the question was What the hell with this scene all right?

337
00:22:49,181 --> 00:22:57,791
Speaker 1: And this is a video that actually in very well researched well documented detail Explains the most likely story with the scene.

338
00:22:57,991 --> 00:22:59,577
Speaker 0: the movie's not that old couldn't you ask.

339
00:22:59,657 --> 00:23:00,982
Speaker 0: I mean Kubrick's dead But he won't.

340
00:23:01,443 --> 00:23:04,292
Speaker 1: no one involved will answer like no they did.

341
00:23:04,513 --> 00:23:09,829
Speaker 1: and actually apparently he was famous for Specifically with The Shining not explaining things.

342
00:23:10,512 --> 00:23:20,379
Speaker 0: you couldn't just ask the guy who was wearing the bear suit they weren't told Put on this bear suit and suck this guy up As far as I can tell yeah, and you say yes.

343
00:23:20,761 --> 00:23:25,553
Speaker 1: So you want to know what the what the pretty like for real explanation probably is all right.

344
00:23:25,774 --> 00:23:33,538
Speaker 1: Jack Nicholson was molesting the kid and That's the backstory of the whole movie And her revelation of figuring this out.

345
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:38,920
Speaker 1: And there's a lot of good reasons why this is the case and I found a bunch of essays going into it in detail.

346
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,173
Speaker 1: But this because none of you are gonna read essays.

347
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:49,500
Speaker 1: I know none of you read essays So you can all watch this four and a half minute YouTube video that will probably convince you that that is the reason.

348
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,185
Speaker 1: That's the story behind the bear.

349
00:23:51,205 --> 00:23:55,739
Speaker 0: I mean you could probably get gather that as a possibility even without the bear.

350
00:23:55,759 --> 00:24:04,457
Speaker 1: uh Yeah, but the bear motif is used in all the scenes like literally every scene that reinforces the.

351
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:12,438
Speaker 1: he is molesting his Kid and him and the kid both have these ghosts and demons and the wife doesn't see him because she's like not involved.

352
00:24:12,699 --> 00:24:21,171
Speaker 1: and this Scene represents her coming to the realization that she married a psychopath Because that's literally saying she's running away from him when he's got the axe.

353
00:24:21,552 --> 00:24:24,856
Speaker 0: You know no bear no TV Something.

354
00:24:28,824 --> 00:24:29,709
Speaker 1: This video is just like.

355
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:35,211
Speaker 1: it's very succinct for how Complexive an analysis it is and he even has ever.

356
00:24:35,231 --> 00:24:47,135
Speaker 1: there's even further evidence that there was a deleted scene Where the kid where there's a very prominent bear that touches on this real close Mmm, so yeah, that's my thing of the day right?

357
00:24:47,175 --> 00:24:51,241
Speaker 0: It's not unless frightening unless Halloween Related.

358
00:24:51,341 --> 00:24:52,747
Speaker 0: so slot car racing.

359
00:24:52,787 --> 00:25:00,780
Speaker 0: you know where they put the car on the track and all you can do is make you go fast Or go slow because I was real into that as a kid and you would you know you would get one.

360
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,780
Speaker 1: You'd set it up once you'd play for you hold the thing down It would fly off the track and you say what's this bullshit, right?

361
00:25:06,141 --> 00:25:07,219
Speaker 0: You'd play with it a little bit.

362
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,799
Speaker 0: Then you play with it one more time when you remember that you had it And then you never play with it again.

363
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,808
Speaker 1: And then I always tried to be competitive.

364
00:25:12,828 --> 00:25:14,033
Speaker 0: you didn't have an expensive one.

365
00:25:14,053 --> 00:25:16,985
Speaker 0: you had a cheapo one from Toys R Us and it Really worked.

366
00:25:17,146 --> 00:25:20,720
Speaker 1: they also because of the way the paddles that were shaped like guns usually worked.

367
00:25:21,161 --> 00:25:28,503
Speaker 1: They would always smell like ozone when they were running like always mm-hmm anyway, so You know.

368
00:25:28,543 --> 00:25:32,820
Speaker 0: apparently that's like a hobby that you can get into if they know and there's pros and such.

369
00:25:33,524 --> 00:25:35,275
Speaker 0: And I had never you know thought about.

370
00:25:35,295 --> 00:25:56,479
Speaker 0: I knew that it was a thing But I never thought about it too hard or cared about it too much, but here's some video of a world championship a while's back And Wow Okay, this video is some people have put in way too much effort into playing this at a very high level And now you can witness it, and you never need to see it again.

371
00:25:56,941 --> 00:26:01,900
Speaker 1: You know we talked like we've done lectures about like eSports and how like games have to have good expectation.

372
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:06,179
Speaker 0: This is like if you've said that your car goes flying off the track.

373
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:09,740
Speaker 0: well Yeah for the pros it also goes flying off the track pretty much constantly yep.

374
00:26:10,222 --> 00:26:15,949
Speaker 1: Well now like the people who go off the track you can see like well they lost that's over obviously But you know it still happens.

375
00:26:15,989 --> 00:26:17,217
Speaker 0: It's not like you know.

376
00:26:17,237 --> 00:26:17,760
Speaker 0: They're so good.

377
00:26:19,464 --> 00:26:27,378
Speaker 1: But I guess like we make fun of dota for having like bad spectator heuristics watch this video Watch what this is like.

378
00:26:28,444 --> 00:26:31,976
Speaker 0: Yeah, tell me who's in first Tell me anything.

379
00:26:32,036 --> 00:26:32,380
Speaker 1: It's literally.

380
00:26:34,364 --> 00:26:37,739
Speaker 1: And then it just stops and everyone just walks over to pick up their cars.

381
00:26:39,362 --> 00:26:45,212
Speaker 0: The noise I guess I think it's you know not just the control of the car But also the making of the car.

382
00:26:45,252 --> 00:26:46,178
Speaker 0: I think is a lot of the hobby.

383
00:26:46,218 --> 00:26:53,934
Speaker 1: yeah But the skill of it is literally just f1 racing Except the only thing you have one finger was your speed.

384
00:26:54,095 --> 00:26:55,480
Speaker 0: one finger f1 racing with.

385
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,528
Speaker 1: no It's just gas and brake and nothing else you have.

386
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:58,291
Speaker 1: no you can't.

387
00:26:58,311 --> 00:26:59,717
Speaker 1: you don't have to steer just gas and brake.

388
00:26:59,979 --> 00:27:06,682
Speaker 1: yep And turns out even gas and brake is real hard like if you went to this track and took one of these cars and tried To drive it around.

389
00:27:06,702 --> 00:27:14,905
Speaker 1: it would fly off the first turn would fly off immediately, or you'd be going like like stop and start Maybe start a fire.

390
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:17,636
Speaker 0: pretty much exactly what would happen if you drove a real f1 car.

391
00:27:17,656 --> 00:27:22,236
Speaker 0: you'd either go fast So fast you killed yourself in the first turn or go so slow the car didn't work.

392
00:27:22,518 --> 00:27:23,708
Speaker 1: Yep the car Just catch fire.

393
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:29,514
Speaker 0: well f1 cars Don't work unless you go fast enough because you won't get enough heat into the brakes And then you won't be able to stop.

394
00:27:29,534 --> 00:27:31,064
Speaker 0: no It's you know.

395
00:27:31,084 --> 00:27:35,520
Speaker 0: so it's like you have to go a certain speed also and get the car warmed up or else it doesn't go.

396
00:27:36,067 --> 00:27:39,186
Speaker 1: So I've randomly Recently learned a lot about.

397
00:27:39,206 --> 00:27:45,570
Speaker 1: this is kind of obscure, but in World War two like planes on aircraft carriers It was a real hard to warm him up.

398
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:50,714
Speaker 1: like you had to run him on the deck for a long time Or they literally just couldn't take off or would just explode.

399
00:27:51,015 --> 00:27:51,980
Speaker 0: you gotta get it cuz.

400
00:27:52,901 --> 00:27:54,406
Speaker 1: Think the reason was just like f1.

401
00:27:54,426 --> 00:28:00,307
Speaker 1: when you take off you basically have to go from idle to full Throttle and hold it there.

402
00:28:00,327 --> 00:28:03,477
Speaker 1: so if you do that on an unwarmed up engine it would just explode.

403
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:04,722
Speaker 0: well cuz it has to do With oil.

404
00:28:04,903 --> 00:28:05,526
Speaker 0: right it's like.

405
00:28:05,606 --> 00:28:06,149
Speaker 0: it's like okay.

406
00:28:06,169 --> 00:28:08,420
Speaker 0: also rotary engines right, but it's like all right.

407
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:16,420
Speaker 0: We need the oil to be liquidy and Lubricating so that the metal parts can move without exploding the turbines of the pistons or whatever they are.

408
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,300
Speaker 1: Yep, and in a complicated rotary engine you also have to get it distributed around the engine.

409
00:28:20,361 --> 00:28:33,280
Speaker 0: So we put some oil in there And if the oil is nice and liquidy and lubricating at like room temperature Then when you get your engine be it f1 or you know f15 it turns into fire it turns into fire.

410
00:28:33,884 --> 00:28:42,139
Speaker 0: So you need oil that's basically solid at room temperature Basically, and then you got to get it warmed up.

411
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:43,445
Speaker 0: You know to the.

412
00:28:43,606 --> 00:28:51,111
Speaker 0: you know cuz it needs to be nice and liquidy and normal at F-15 jet engine temperature, which is much much hotter.

413
00:28:51,713 --> 00:28:53,437
Speaker 0: so at regular room temperature.

414
00:28:53,557 --> 00:28:54,540
Speaker 0: It's not going anywhere.

415
00:28:54,641 --> 00:28:55,304
Speaker 0: So you need you know.

416
00:28:55,445 --> 00:28:57,515
Speaker 1: yeah, well these are old propeller planes, and it was.

417
00:28:57,596 --> 00:28:58,460
Speaker 1: it's all just kind of crazy.

418
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:04,920
Speaker 1: I'm reading this really really Kind of book that you would never want to read, but it's about the details of some aircraft carrier stuff.

419
00:29:05,302 --> 00:29:07,113
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't need to know that it's pretty interesting.

420
00:29:07,355 --> 00:29:09,123
Speaker 1: the best part about it Is there's this dude.

421
00:29:09,324 --> 00:29:14,300
Speaker 0: if we ever end up on an aircraft carrier in some sort of post-apocalyptic situation bring a copy with you.

422
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:17,752
Speaker 1: Here's here's remember remember the Russian space program asides his rims.

423
00:29:17,792 --> 00:29:28,471
Speaker 1: World War two Pacific war aside There's this dude in the Battle of Midway from the Japanese side right and he had to fly a recon plane out to look for American ships and then fly back.

424
00:29:28,854 --> 00:29:29,800
Speaker 0: you didn't just get shot down.

425
00:29:30,021 --> 00:29:31,005
Speaker 1: Oh, no, so I don't know.

426
00:29:31,025 --> 00:29:32,852
Speaker 1: I think he survived the war.

427
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:41,326
Speaker 1: at least he survived this battle, but The situation he was in is he went out and he ended up getting airborne like an hour late And he also went the wrong direction.

428
00:29:41,607 --> 00:29:45,320
Speaker 1: good job, so he gets out there and eventually he's like guys.

429
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:51,404
Speaker 1: I see like ten American ships over here and the commanders are like other aircraft curves What kind of ships?

430
00:29:51,806 --> 00:29:54,320
Speaker 1: and he basically doesn't know and can't give these good answers?

431
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:58,100
Speaker 1: So they're like well stay out there and keep an eye on him and let us know if you think there's an aircraft carrier.

432
00:29:58,746 --> 00:30:09,264
Speaker 1: and then the Battle of Midway happens and Periodically throughout the entire battle he kept radioing back saying basically yeah getting low on fuel out here Can I come back in?

433
00:30:09,927 --> 00:30:13,120
Speaker 1: and it appears that the Japanese commanders kept forgetting about him?

434
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:24,798
Speaker 1: So he'd radio in and they'd be like oh no But there's a report and he'd report and then they'd be like yeah stay out there and keep watching and he'd be like Okay, and he kept radioing back because then they'd forget he was out there.

435
00:30:24,818 --> 00:30:29,411
Speaker 1: and Eventually he radios back like yeah, I'm basically out of fuel.

436
00:30:29,712 --> 00:30:32,320
Speaker 1: I'm coming back, and they're like who are you again?

437
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,342
Speaker 1: Where are you?

438
00:30:33,784 --> 00:30:33,865
Speaker 1: No?

439
00:30:33,885 --> 00:30:34,708
Speaker 1: You're not stay out there.

440
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:40,590
Speaker 1: We need you out there, and he's like yes I will stay out here and then exactly one minute later.

441
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:46,626
Speaker 1: He radios back and says something to the effect of fuck it I'm coming home And I don't know what happened.

442
00:30:46,646 --> 00:30:48,956
Speaker 1: the history books don't know anything about this guy after this point.

443
00:30:49,076 --> 00:30:49,799
Speaker 0: How do they know this?

444
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,288
Speaker 1: Radio logs.

445
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:52,816
Speaker 0: someone's recording all this.

446
00:30:52,837 --> 00:30:59,440
Speaker 1: yeah There are detailed logs of like everything that was said over the radios for most of these battles in World War two.

447
00:30:59,881 --> 00:31:00,545
Speaker 0: That's interesting.

448
00:31:00,665 --> 00:31:01,550
Speaker 1: There's yeah, that's it.

449
00:31:01,731 --> 00:31:03,600
Speaker 1: There's there's interesting stuff in this book.

450
00:31:03,741 --> 00:31:06,439
Speaker 0: We should go read aim chat logs to the 90s and see if this is.

451
00:31:09,482 --> 00:31:12,079
Speaker 1: I've got some old chat logs that could be a reading on the patreon.

452
00:31:13,002 --> 00:31:14,105
Speaker 1: Anyway in the meta moment.

453
00:31:14,887 --> 00:31:26,337
Speaker 1: We are going to be at doing a panel writing game rules at gamer X East Which is in New York City November 12th and 13th, so it's a gaming con you do not.

454
00:31:26,357 --> 00:31:33,292
Speaker 1: it is a LGBT focused gaming con But that just means that it is a friendly environment to that like.

455
00:31:33,312 --> 00:31:42,720
Speaker 1: it is encouraging of that and as a result You know just might be a lot less agro and a lot more chill than say the average gaming con or a lot more party.

456
00:31:43,021 --> 00:31:46,452
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it is just an awesome gaming con.

457
00:31:46,512 --> 00:31:52,710
Speaker 1: you do not have to be gay to go to this con A homo you just have to not be a homophobe.

458
00:31:53,051 --> 00:31:54,214
Speaker 0: yes, you would have a bad time.

459
00:31:54,434 --> 00:31:54,755
Speaker 1: Yeah.

460
00:31:55,176 --> 00:31:57,557
Speaker 1: Yeah, there is no GG here There's only good game.

461
00:31:58,741 --> 00:32:01,800
Speaker 1: So this con is just awesome, and it's out in a play.

462
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,838
Speaker 1: You know it's far away, so we don't go to it, but gamer X has an East Coast version.

463
00:32:05,899 --> 00:32:10,595
Speaker 1: now It looks like they're kick-starting out Australia version - I mean it's right here in New York.

464
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:12,080
Speaker 0: Why not go over there?

465
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,126
Speaker 0: It'll take me five minutes.

466
00:32:13,186 --> 00:32:15,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you live in New York like seriously just go to this con.

467
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,997
Speaker 1: It's gonna be two days of us playing tabletop, so go over there.

468
00:32:20,057 --> 00:32:20,760
Speaker 0: I'll play some games.

469
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,620
Speaker 1: I'll come home yep, but we'll be doing one panel at it.

470
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:30,885
Speaker 1: We're doing writing game rules, but because it's a smallish con and the panel rooms are not that big I'm gonna be very clear.

471
00:32:31,387 --> 00:32:36,748
Speaker 1: if you have seen us do this panel before do not come to this con To see this panel.

472
00:32:36,868 --> 00:32:38,779
Speaker 0: you should not come to this con just to see us.

473
00:32:39,664 --> 00:32:45,493
Speaker 1: But if you've already seen us talk about writing game rules Don't go to this panel because literally the rooms not gonna be that big.

474
00:32:45,553 --> 00:32:48,145
Speaker 1: I'd rather someone who doesn't know who we are See the panel.

475
00:32:48,729 --> 00:32:53,810
Speaker 1: so yeah if you come to this panel And I recognize you and I know that you've already seen it.

476
00:32:54,512 --> 00:32:58,808
Speaker 1: I'm gonna throw some shade at you probably in the panel Which we're good at that.

477
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:00,459
Speaker 1: Yeah gamer X. We're gonna be there.

478
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:12,569
Speaker 1: we're gonna be a magfest as well on a bunch of panels January 5th through 8th down in the DC's and I'm assuming we're gonna be a peck south Magfest you should go to even if we're not there.

479
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:18,668
Speaker 0: Yeah, even if you live in like I don't know The Sahara Desert you should find your way to magfest.

480
00:33:18,749 --> 00:33:22,480
Speaker 1: magfest is a con like Pax's that is worth flying to.

481
00:33:23,282 --> 00:33:25,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's worth going to you know good luck.

482
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,116
Speaker 0: It's already too late if you're not already planned start planning for magfest 2018 at this point.

483
00:33:30,156 --> 00:33:45,822
Speaker 1: guys seriously And the book club is of course still Rebecca And the other book club the scout doesn't want to do on the rise of Nazism in the Weimar Republic the geek nights politics book Club.

484
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:49,337
Speaker 1: we're gonna record our podcast as soon as I can get Andrew to respond to an.

485
00:33:49,418 --> 00:33:49,759
Speaker 0: I am.

486
00:33:51,061 --> 00:33:55,340
Speaker 1: So if you read that book the episodes coming if you didn't read that book you don't.

487
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,983
Speaker 1: It's a really good book.

488
00:33:57,003 --> 00:34:00,354
Speaker 1: read Rebecca Rebecca's really sure.

489
00:34:00,615 --> 00:34:04,280
Speaker 0: I read like a few chapters And then I stopped because I was doing all the stuff.

490
00:34:04,421 --> 00:34:10,260
Speaker 1: I'm gonna read it soon because I'm almost done with this other nonfiction book I'm reading where I learned about private first class.

491
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:10,982
Speaker 1: I think he's first class.

492
00:34:11,002 --> 00:34:13,288
Speaker 1: you say anyway private Amari is garbage.

493
00:34:13,388 --> 00:34:15,413
Speaker 1: private Amari is the dude.

494
00:34:15,793 --> 00:34:18,239
Speaker 0: so I read nonfiction all day on the internet.

495
00:34:18,781 --> 00:34:31,559
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is reading a nonfiction history book that is well-written is a far cry from reading Nonfiction on the internet just because it's well-written, but it's not relevant to my life.

496
00:34:33,023 --> 00:34:34,467
Speaker 0: Fiction is it could be.

497
00:34:34,928 --> 00:34:36,331
Speaker 1: actually it very much could be.

498
00:34:36,391 --> 00:34:39,780
Speaker 0: really something that happened in some war is relevant to my non-war existence.

499
00:34:39,962 --> 00:34:40,795
Speaker 1: You know what is relevant to?

500
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:45,742
Speaker 1: distribution of your carrier decks in Civ 5.

501
00:34:45,742 --> 00:34:46,385
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I'm good.

502
00:34:46,788 --> 00:34:46,949
Speaker 1: Well.

503
00:34:47,029 --> 00:34:48,295
Speaker 1: You know you're real bad at that.

504
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:52,043
Speaker 1: I expect Otherwise.

505
00:34:52,063 --> 00:34:55,233
Speaker 1: we got the patreon Scott's YouTube channel and my youtube channel.

506
00:34:55,273 --> 00:34:57,299
Speaker 1: both have tons of content coming in.

507
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:05,062
Speaker 1: I'm editing a video right now poorly and we are live streaming geek nights even though that was a patreon goal that we have not Reached.

508
00:35:05,544 --> 00:35:06,288
Speaker 1: I'm doing it anyway.

509
00:35:06,308 --> 00:35:08,197
Speaker 1: I'm just not gonna do it all the time necessarily.

510
00:35:08,217 --> 00:35:09,465
Speaker 1: so this episode That's good.

511
00:35:09,505 --> 00:35:10,674
Speaker 0: people are not giving her money.

512
00:35:10,694 --> 00:35:11,420
Speaker 0: He's getting desperate.

513
00:35:12,882 --> 00:35:13,365
Speaker 1: Okay money.

514
00:35:13,385 --> 00:35:14,413
Speaker 1: We're well over $300 a month in the patreon.

515
00:35:15,641 --> 00:35:16,386
Speaker 0: Give me that money then.

516
00:35:16,466 --> 00:35:18,520
Speaker 0: cuz I'm paying 150 a month for the stupid forum.

517
00:35:19,802 --> 00:35:21,191
Speaker 1: I could put some of the money toward the forum.

518
00:35:21,372 --> 00:35:21,955
Speaker 0: just give me 150 a month.

519
00:35:23,384 --> 00:35:28,405
Speaker 1: Maybe I will if you but then you have to Stop trash-talking the patreon.

520
00:35:29,047 --> 00:35:31,573
Speaker 1: no because the patreon will be directly funding us.

521
00:35:31,974 --> 00:35:33,077
Speaker 0: I'll just delete the form then.

522
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:36,011
Speaker 1: oh See state if you have opinions.

523
00:35:36,091 --> 00:35:42,910
Speaker 1: actually this kind of an important meta vanilla forums kind of suck now But they're still the best forums out there.

524
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:44,940
Speaker 1: there aren't other forums.

525
00:35:45,847 --> 00:35:53,060
Speaker 1: We are not sure what to do And we're earnestly like trying to figure out a better solution because we want a forum.

526
00:35:53,362 --> 00:35:57,669
Speaker 0: Well I want to use the discord thingy But the discord thingy is not like.

527
00:35:57,709 --> 00:36:00,620
Speaker 0: if they something happens to them then what we lose everything.

528
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,484
Speaker 0: It's a forum.

529
00:36:01,524 --> 00:36:02,247
Speaker 0: everything is saved.

530
00:36:02,267 --> 00:36:04,115
Speaker 0: like I have a backup of the forum database.

531
00:36:04,658 --> 00:36:05,079
Speaker 0: It's safe.

532
00:36:05,768 --> 00:36:06,680
Speaker 0: You know we can't get fucked.

533
00:36:07,061 --> 00:36:13,078
Speaker 1: Even if it all disappears the data could be put on the internet and mind and we could use it for stuff.

534
00:36:13,118 --> 00:36:16,448
Speaker 0: right we move Everyone our community to a discord chat.

535
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,113
Speaker 0: it'll be way active and have an.

536
00:36:18,133 --> 00:36:20,725
Speaker 0: I assume it'll be way active and everyone have a party Time in there.

537
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:22,720
Speaker 0: to be great, but it's different forms.

538
00:36:22,821 --> 00:36:24,692
Speaker 1: It's a different form of interaction and then it goes.

539
00:36:24,772 --> 00:36:28,085
Speaker 0: and then if something happens to it It's like well We just lost everything guys.

540
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:30,474
Speaker 1: and you might already be thinking but rim and Scott why not both?

541
00:36:30,714 --> 00:36:31,377
Speaker 1: that doesn't work.

542
00:36:31,598 --> 00:36:34,520
Speaker 0: if you have a forum And I have a discord no one will go in the forum.

543
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,407
Speaker 1: Yeah, the forum would just die.

544
00:36:36,909 --> 00:36:44,875
Speaker 1: and if you're saying if you think well just let the forum die I don't think you understand the horrifying degree of Google juice that forum has.

545
00:36:44,915 --> 00:36:46,459
Speaker 0: there is all we don't have to let.

546
00:36:46,479 --> 00:36:50,092
Speaker 0: we can just Keep it up in like read-only mode yeah, but but even

547
00:36:50,132 --> 00:36:53,845
Speaker 1: then like there's a lot in there And I want to put

548
00:36:54,266 --> 00:36:56,112
Speaker 0: it 11 years of typing

549
00:36:56,112 --> 00:37:00,869
Speaker 1: 11 years of typing and the forum used to be a lot more Active in the early days, so

550
00:37:00,889 --> 00:37:03,360
Speaker 0: I just think I think people aren't into forums these days.

551
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:08,840
Speaker 1: Well, I get the impression a lot of people read the forum, but very but like a tenth of them posts.

552
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:10,443
Speaker 1: That's the impression.

553
00:37:10,483 --> 00:37:11,487
Speaker 1: I get just based on

554
00:37:11,768 --> 00:37:14,156
Speaker 0: I can I can look at numbers and find out yeah,

555
00:37:14,859 --> 00:37:33,840
Speaker 1: but anyway Seriously like if you have suggestions You want things you have input you just anything about how to have our geek nights community outside of the podcast continue Posting the forum about it because we're earnestly to start deciding what to do all the way up to and including.

556
00:37:34,261 --> 00:37:39,759
Speaker 1: Maybe we should quit our jobs and write an actual good forum because apparently no one else is.

557
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:41,993
Speaker 0: Yeah, you pay me enough money.

558
00:37:42,014 --> 00:37:45,090
Speaker 1: Yeah There is a goal in the patreon that would.

559
00:37:45,131 --> 00:37:49,294
Speaker 1: we would both quit our jobs and just do geek night stuff Which would include writing the forum tons of money.

560
00:37:49,294 --> 00:37:52,637
Speaker 1: 12 grand a month I think is what we said it at need more than that.

561
00:37:52,738 --> 00:37:56,453
Speaker 1: that way I think 12 grand a month would cover both of our living expenses.

562
00:37:56,473 --> 00:37:58,360
Speaker 0: so the forum has like a hundred and something.

563
00:37:59,081 --> 00:38:01,490
Speaker 0: Users, I don't know if that's how that's measured.

564
00:38:01,551 --> 00:38:02,494
Speaker 0: is it active users.

565
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:03,920
Speaker 1: I think that's only active users.

566
00:38:04,381 --> 00:38:07,692
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't even know because we have all those old accounts of like.

567
00:38:07,853 --> 00:38:10,985
Speaker 1: Killarney hasn't posted in a long time Hungry Joe.

568
00:38:11,005 --> 00:38:12,151
Speaker 1: I don't think I've seen him around.

569
00:38:12,171 --> 00:38:14,020
Speaker 0: I can't really tell how to read this.

570
00:38:14,442 --> 00:38:18,440
Speaker 0: It's like did we only have 11 users in a single day, that's not much yeah.

571
00:38:18,721 --> 00:38:22,572
Speaker 1: But then again because it's public you know I logged in or in the past month.

572
00:38:22,692 --> 00:38:32,686
Speaker 0: We've had 1.3 million pageviews, which is You know yeah It's a twenty six thousand comments Goddamn, that's all.

573
00:38:32,927 --> 00:38:34,816
Speaker 1: that is more than all the tweets.

574
00:38:34,876 --> 00:38:37,806
Speaker 1: I've ever tweeted But no that's had.

575
00:38:37,826 --> 00:38:39,713
Speaker 1: Oh, I think that's actually half as many as all the tweets.

576
00:38:39,753 --> 00:38:40,315
Speaker 1: I've ever tweeted.

577
00:38:40,335 --> 00:38:50,119
Speaker 0: I have 2170 comments you have 2056 comments and the third place is Cherbo with 1045 comments.

578
00:38:51,441 --> 00:38:52,124
Speaker 1: So yeah, where were?

579
00:38:52,144 --> 00:38:54,031
Speaker 1: that's something we're actively working on in geek nights.

580
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:56,299
Speaker 1: It will do a whole like meta show on it at some point.

581
00:38:57,867 --> 00:39:00,590
Speaker 1: so Civilization six I wasn't.

582
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:02,080
Speaker 0: it was you know it was a brand new game.

583
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:02,843
Speaker 0: It just came out.

584
00:39:02,964 --> 00:39:06,519
Speaker 0: usually I wait for the game of the year edition, but I said you know what?

585
00:39:07,481 --> 00:39:08,466
Speaker 0: Everywhere I just fuck it.

586
00:39:08,506 --> 00:39:09,068
Speaker 0: I'll just play it.

587
00:39:09,551 --> 00:39:11,399
Speaker 1: I bought it while I was in Australia.

588
00:39:11,419 --> 00:39:16,794
Speaker 1: I Wanted to play it on the plane home because guess what it's system requirements not bad.

589
00:39:16,834 --> 00:39:18,398
Speaker 1: It'll run fine on my old Lenovo x230.

590
00:39:19,961 --> 00:39:24,934
Speaker 1: The only problem was I would have to download like 15 gigabytes in Australia.

591
00:39:25,175 --> 00:39:25,315
Speaker 0: Well.

592
00:39:25,335 --> 00:39:26,679
Speaker 0: They don't have 15 gigabytes there.

593
00:39:26,779 --> 00:39:28,945
Speaker 1: no In fact the nice hotel.

594
00:39:28,985 --> 00:39:32,639
Speaker 1: I was staying in unless I paid a lot more money only gave us a gigabyte a day.

595
00:39:34,621 --> 00:39:37,131
Speaker 1: So I'd wait till I got home, that's why I was playing Civ 5.

596
00:39:37,131 --> 00:39:38,115
Speaker 0: great reason not to live there.

597
00:39:38,858 --> 00:39:42,190
Speaker 1: uh yeah Well if Trump gets elected would think it might.

598
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:44,038
Speaker 1: it might be a wash we could head out there.

599
00:39:45,362 --> 00:39:49,365
Speaker 0: This better places to go where I can go to Tropical Island.

600
00:39:49,807 --> 00:39:52,120
Speaker 1: yeah, tropical island Scott have a lot of problems.

601
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,925
Speaker 1: You're not thinking about like what.

602
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:56,994
Speaker 1: internet's not great there either, but I have bananas.

603
00:39:57,656 --> 00:40:00,542
Speaker 1: There's bananas in Australia Sand.

604
00:40:00,964 --> 00:40:06,005
Speaker 1: there's some of the best beaches in the world in Australia Swimmable year-round.

605
00:40:06,367 --> 00:40:08,194
Speaker 0: the swimmable year-round on the tropical island.

606
00:40:08,214 --> 00:40:13,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just got like Brisbane But there's Australians the tropical island diseases.

607
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:18,791
Speaker 0: I'd rather have a disease then Poison you're dead from some animal.

608
00:40:19,052 --> 00:40:23,587
Speaker 1: I have spent actually uh I was counting up just all my trips for Australia.

609
00:40:24,129 --> 00:40:25,774
Speaker 1: I've spent like two months there.

610
00:40:25,794 --> 00:40:27,400
Speaker 1: I've never gotten poisoned.

611
00:40:28,163 --> 00:40:28,625
Speaker 0: You got lucky.

612
00:40:29,308 --> 00:40:32,220
Speaker 1: I got the shits once on Manly, but that was from a Mexican restaurant.

613
00:40:32,982 --> 00:40:37,108
Speaker 1: That's probably the worst thing that ever happened to me that Other than the time I punched myself in the face.

614
00:40:37,329 --> 00:40:39,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what there isn't in Australia Mexican food.

615
00:40:40,581 --> 00:40:41,343
Speaker 0: Well, we tried it when.

616
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:44,150
Speaker 1: yeah, I've tried it three times ever.

617
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,596
Speaker 1: I have decided it is impossible to get it.

618
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:47,699
Speaker 0: Why don't we?

619
00:40:48,701 --> 00:40:51,820
Speaker 0: You know find some Mexican people and fund them.

620
00:40:52,823 --> 00:40:54,840
Speaker 1: Get like a fancy Mexican restaurant like put it inside.

621
00:40:55,302 --> 00:41:01,444
Speaker 0: Let's just go over to like cafe my and be like, hey you want to open up in Australia Cafe my.

622
00:41:01,485 --> 00:41:02,551
Speaker 1: I'm so hungry right now.

623
00:41:02,611 --> 00:41:03,516
Speaker 1: This is gonna be hard.

624
00:41:03,536 --> 00:41:04,240
Speaker 1: to the rest of the podcast.

625
00:41:04,424 --> 00:41:07,408
Speaker 1: I'm pretty hungry But yeah, so sieve six.

626
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:18,419
Speaker 1: that my biggest fear because we talked about this not that long ago Was that sieve six would do what sieve five and sieve four did because sieve four and especially sieve five when they came out.

627
00:41:19,065 --> 00:41:20,017
Speaker 1: We're garbage games.

628
00:41:20,742 --> 00:41:23,573
Speaker 1: Sit five especially like when it first came out like.

629
00:41:23,653 --> 00:41:25,360
Speaker 1: it was revolutionary and all these changes.

630
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:34,488
Speaker 1: But the game was kind of simplistic and it really just like it was just this kind of simple Optimization problem and it just wasn't fun.

631
00:41:34,528 --> 00:41:37,840
Speaker 1: There was very little depth and sieve five was literally not worth playing.

632
00:41:37,941 --> 00:41:38,747
Speaker 1: We all stopped playing it.

633
00:41:38,968 --> 00:41:39,412
Speaker 0: It's so weird.

634
00:41:39,432 --> 00:41:40,500
Speaker 0: There's even six sieves.

635
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:45,378
Speaker 0: It's like yeah sieve two was like the only one and sieve three was about the day came out.

636
00:41:45,418 --> 00:41:45,880
Speaker 0: It was man.

637
00:41:46,221 --> 00:41:47,485
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's probably the worst one.

638
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,290
Speaker 1: sieve three is definitely the worst worst one.

639
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:52,991
Speaker 0: sieve four once it got expanded one is the second worst one.

640
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:56,144
Speaker 1: yeah Sieve four was good Once it had expansions.

641
00:41:56,626 --> 00:41:57,228
Speaker 1: sieve five.

642
00:41:57,709 --> 00:42:00,820
Speaker 1: sieve five before the expansions might be the third worst one.

643
00:42:02,021 --> 00:42:07,496
Speaker 1: But once brave new world came out sieve five was the best sieve that had ever been made.

644
00:42:07,637 --> 00:42:08,680
Speaker 1: like far and away.

645
00:42:09,162 --> 00:42:10,247
Speaker 1: It's just so good.

646
00:42:10,267 --> 00:42:11,814
Speaker 1: I mean it's telling them.

647
00:42:11,834 --> 00:42:13,099
Speaker 0: He doesn't have the cheating mode though.

648
00:42:13,903 --> 00:42:16,095
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I don't really care about that anymore.

649
00:42:16,115 --> 00:42:18,003
Speaker 0: to cheating mode I play.

650
00:42:18,023 --> 00:42:20,493
Speaker 0: I've still probably played sieve two more than any other sieves.

651
00:42:20,654 --> 00:42:22,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you played it kind of weird.

652
00:42:22,301 --> 00:42:23,217
Speaker 1: You played it with kid brain.

653
00:42:24,621 --> 00:42:28,974
Speaker 1: Yeah, all the enemy all the enemy says also you can you cannot beat that.

654
00:42:29,055 --> 00:42:30,720
Speaker 0: DaVinci's workshop video and music.

655
00:42:33,441 --> 00:42:35,305
Speaker 1: Also, you always play the game the same way.

656
00:42:35,325 --> 00:42:44,171
Speaker 1: DaVinci's workshop upgrades all your all your workers to engineers and all your Everything automatically in for free.

657
00:42:44,191 --> 00:42:46,245
Speaker 0: it was the best That was.

658
00:42:46,265 --> 00:42:46,487
Speaker 1: that was.

659
00:42:46,507 --> 00:42:50,820
Speaker 0: that's why I basically had to rush it and if I didn't get it I'd quit cuz I didn't want to manage upgrading all my guys.

660
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:53,352
Speaker 1: I also quit if I didn't get the pyramids because of the pain in the ass.

661
00:42:53,372 --> 00:42:54,497
Speaker 1: bill granaries everywhere.

662
00:42:54,517 --> 00:42:55,060
Speaker 0: That's right.

663
00:42:55,502 --> 00:42:59,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, think about powerful shit was just like free granary fucking everywhere.

664
00:42:59,141 --> 00:43:06,720
Speaker 0: Yeah And back then grant imagine something in sieve four five or six was just like free granary everywhere and granary did what aqueducts do now.

665
00:43:07,781 --> 00:43:13,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I know sieve six is a huge evolution with substantial changes.

666
00:43:13,682 --> 00:43:24,860
Speaker 1: But unlike sieve five which started over and started, baby Sieve six day one is as complicated if not more complicated than sieve five fully expanded.

667
00:43:25,021 --> 00:43:37,720
Speaker 0: It's so weird because in the one hand it is more complicated much more complicated to the point at which Like I have a hard time knowing to do on my turn Watch my stream and like I played it blind literally last night for the first time.

668
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:40,889
Speaker 1: So I click on something and I'm like envoys.

669
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:41,992
Speaker 1: the fuck is that?

670
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:43,817
Speaker 1: wait are there two science tracks?

671
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,600
Speaker 1: Oh I have a mix-and-match government, right?

672
00:43:47,921 --> 00:43:57,440
Speaker 0: So the thing is is that even though it's more complicated each Individual system and all these details of the game have actually been made much more elegant.

673
00:43:58,063 --> 00:44:07,020
Speaker 0: So, you know it can consider this like in sieve In sieve five if like happiness and there's like global happiness and local happiness.

674
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:12,822
Speaker 0: And now you can ignore local happiness unless you really sucked at the guy, but I'm saying it's confusing It's not.

675
00:44:12,842 --> 00:44:16,434
Speaker 0: you're not a hundred percent sure how every detail of this system works.

676
00:44:16,575 --> 00:44:20,831
Speaker 1: unless I was I'm literally 100% sure how happiness works in sieve five.

677
00:44:20,871 --> 00:44:21,855
Speaker 0: Well, I'm not so.

678
00:44:21,956 --> 00:44:23,040
Speaker 1: anyway, it's real simple.

679
00:44:23,301 --> 00:44:25,007
Speaker 1: You have a non happiness number.

680
00:44:25,289 --> 00:44:28,260
Speaker 1: that is driven by population number of cities.

681
00:44:28,642 --> 00:44:30,310
Speaker 1: There's a few other things that'll drive it.

682
00:44:30,732 --> 00:44:32,100
Speaker 1: you have a happiness number.

683
00:44:32,802 --> 00:44:35,131
Speaker 1: The difference between the two is all that matters.

684
00:44:35,814 --> 00:44:41,211
Speaker 0: if it hits negative ten you're fucked Right, but this happiness affects like so many things.

685
00:44:41,251 --> 00:44:41,833
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't.

686
00:44:41,873 --> 00:44:52,209
Speaker 1: it affects them all in trivial ways tiny tiny minuses of percent to military effectiveness while you're unhappy if you had negative ten like partisans and shit start coming out.

687
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:55,261
Speaker 1: if it's Positive then your cities grow faster.

688
00:44:55,462 --> 00:44:57,270
Speaker 1: if it's negative your cities basically stop growing.

689
00:44:57,511 --> 00:44:59,397
Speaker 0: Oh, yes, I can't remember all that shit.

690
00:44:59,517 --> 00:45:01,584
Speaker 0: Anyway, really straight six.

691
00:45:01,945 --> 00:45:03,530
Speaker 0: I don't have to remember all that shit.

692
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:03,852
Speaker 0: It's not.

693
00:45:03,932 --> 00:45:05,420
Speaker 1: you have this housing system.

694
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,210
Speaker 0: It's so much amenities system, right?

695
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:16,070
Speaker 0: It's so much simpler this housing and this amenities and if you have enough amenities your people are happy And if you don't have enough amenities your people are unhappy.

696
00:45:16,432 --> 00:45:19,270
Speaker 1: You also you have is if you have extra amenities like people grow faster.

697
00:45:19,534 --> 00:45:22,818
Speaker 0: If you have enough houses Then your people can.

698
00:45:22,858 --> 00:45:23,822
Speaker 0: you can grow your city.

699
00:45:23,983 --> 00:45:25,930
Speaker 0: the population can increase to fill those houses.

700
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:29,027
Speaker 0: If you don't have enough houses the population of the city doesn't grow.

701
00:45:29,047 --> 00:45:36,686
Speaker 0: that is Complicated than happiness and said five it's but I can understand the rules much more simply.

702
00:45:36,706 --> 00:45:37,930
Speaker 0: It's my straight forward.

703
00:45:38,371 --> 00:45:48,127
Speaker 1: I am actually really shocked by the what you're expressing here because I think no I Agreed with everything you were saying until you said that the CIF five system was complicated.

704
00:45:48,187 --> 00:45:48,850
Speaker 0: It is complicated.

705
00:45:49,593 --> 00:45:50,537
Speaker 0: Here's another example.

706
00:45:50,578 --> 00:45:52,546
Speaker 1: It's way simpler than sieve sixes, right?

707
00:45:52,566 --> 00:45:55,318
Speaker 1: Here's another example But it's way simpler.

708
00:45:55,398 --> 00:45:56,121
Speaker 0: It's not simpler.

709
00:45:56,161 --> 00:45:57,346
Speaker 0: So it is simpler.

710
00:45:57,587 --> 00:45:58,430
Speaker 0: and sieve five.

711
00:45:58,771 --> 00:46:03,306
Speaker 0: There's all sorts of things where there's like exceptions to the rules, right?

712
00:46:03,326 --> 00:46:04,068
Speaker 0: So what?

713
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:11,670
Speaker 0: So for example, like oh if you work a marble then you get this ability to make wonders.

714
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:13,678
Speaker 1: That is literally the only one.

715
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,790
Speaker 0: there's lots of other weird little exception like why?

716
00:46:20,273 --> 00:46:27,750
Speaker 0: Oh if you you know, alright see you when you Start this, you know a thing of what's it called?

717
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:37,901
Speaker 0: I can't remember the name like if you start tradition You get this and then each thing in tradition gives you something and then when you finish tradition Then you get another thing that's just listed on the page.

718
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:40,430
Speaker 1: when you pick them all the words are there.

719
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:41,494
Speaker 1: It's real simple, right?

720
00:46:41,554 --> 00:46:43,019
Speaker 0: But it's much simpler now.

721
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:46,130
Speaker 0: It's like oh we have the system for science like this tech tree.

722
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:51,530
Speaker 0: Let's just make another tree for culture that works exactly the same way.

723
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:54,179
Speaker 0: So you don't have to remember these two different systems.

724
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,270
Speaker 0: It's just you the system you already know how to use.

725
00:46:57,532 --> 00:46:59,390
Speaker 0: We're just gonna reuse that same system again.

726
00:46:59,591 --> 00:47:01,621
Speaker 1: Now that is where I agree with you.

727
00:47:01,781 --> 00:47:09,410
Speaker 1: and while it is more complex in some cases It is also more elegant right and there's no that you don't have to like complain with Yokohama that board game.

728
00:47:09,531 --> 00:47:12,970
Speaker 1: It's more complex, but it is not elegant in its complexity.

729
00:47:13,377 --> 00:47:16,943
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm You know, so it's basically what other things.

730
00:47:17,044 --> 00:47:18,090
Speaker 0: oh so city-states, right?

731
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:22,990
Speaker 0: So in Civ 5 like city-state influence is like the points are going up the points are going down.

732
00:47:23,271 --> 00:47:24,717
Speaker 0: You the points always go down.

733
00:47:24,757 --> 00:47:27,166
Speaker 0: you have to like do stuff to make them go down.

734
00:47:27,226 --> 00:47:28,674
Speaker 1: remind them like hey We're your friends.

735
00:47:28,734 --> 00:47:33,580
Speaker 0: We have to do stuff to make them go down less Right and you do stuff to boost it.

736
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:36,230
Speaker 0: and now it was also money and curry fail.

737
00:47:36,451 --> 00:47:42,790
Speaker 1: It was I'm gonna say a very simple system and it would but it was way more complex than Civ.

738
00:47:43,211 --> 00:47:48,630
Speaker 0: Could you calculate like on hand like how much influence you were gonna have like how much gold?

739
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:51,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, it totally just told you in the screen.

740
00:47:52,101 --> 00:47:52,904
Speaker 0: It's a pain in the ass.

741
00:47:52,944 --> 00:47:54,630
Speaker 0: No now it's much simpler.

742
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:59,023
Speaker 0: It's like oh you are an industrial city-state if I give you argue.

743
00:47:59,043 --> 00:47:59,845
Speaker 1: It's not simpler.

744
00:47:59,865 --> 00:48:06,430
Speaker 1: It's just more Abstracted and as a result they can add more complexity to what it did.

745
00:48:06,531 --> 00:48:08,810
Speaker 0: I give you an envoy and now I get this bonus.

746
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:15,450
Speaker 0: I give me three envoys I get this bonus at six envoys I get another bonus and if I give you more envoys than anyone else I get a super bonus.

747
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:18,750
Speaker 1: That is literally how the olden worked except it was points instead of envoys.

748
00:48:19,612 --> 00:48:20,779
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you couldn't like.

749
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:22,470
Speaker 0: it was very hard to give points.

750
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:23,434
Speaker 0: It wasn't like a direct.

751
00:48:23,655 --> 00:48:25,263
Speaker 0: you now have a point that you can give.

752
00:48:25,464 --> 00:48:29,570
Speaker 0: it was like, you know Oh, I had to kill a barbarian and now you like me.

753
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:33,569
Speaker 1: It was a separate system where they would give you quests you could fulfill which they still do.

754
00:48:34,434 --> 00:48:36,363
Speaker 0: Quest the quest give you the envoys.

755
00:48:36,584 --> 00:48:37,468
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

756
00:48:37,509 --> 00:48:37,770
Speaker 1: That's it.

757
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:45,977
Speaker 1: It's a. it's a more elegant system that allows city-states to have much more complex interactions Even than what Civ 5 did.

758
00:48:46,299 --> 00:48:50,557
Speaker 1: but Civ 5 because it was already a different system Even though it was a simple system.

759
00:48:51,120 --> 00:49:01,650
Speaker 1: every simple but different system you add drastically decreases the elegance of the whole game meaning City-states couldn't be more complex or the game would be too stupid and too complex to fiddly.

760
00:49:02,451 --> 00:49:04,998
Speaker 0: Systems in Civ 6 are much more explicit right?

761
00:49:05,018 --> 00:49:09,570
Speaker 0: Like I have given this envoy to this city-state ding right in Civ 5.

762
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:11,901
Speaker 0: It's like you got some info.

763
00:49:11,942 --> 00:49:13,429
Speaker 0: they like you less than they did.

764
00:49:13,489 --> 00:49:17,369
Speaker 0: yes No, it was like you got 45 influence because of X.

765
00:49:17,972 --> 00:49:24,538
Speaker 1: It's just a less granular system as Final Fantasy 1 hit points instead of Final Fantasy 10 hit points It was.

766
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:25,528
Speaker 0: it was not as easy.

767
00:49:27,692 --> 00:49:32,829
Speaker 1: It is amazing that I can agree with your overall point but disagree with pretty much every example you get.

768
00:49:34,812 --> 00:49:37,088
Speaker 0: Anyway, another good example right is like

769
00:49:37,591 --> 00:49:45,149
Speaker 1: Well here look the boosts like the in spray all that stuff the boosting system in the trees The fact that it is identical between the two

770
00:49:45,871 --> 00:49:46,152
Speaker 0: yeah,

771
00:49:46,714 --> 00:50:04,540
Speaker 1: but that means that the things that trigger them can be Crazily varied like so basically the way this works is if you don't have something in a tree yet Everything in a tree much like the board game Attica if any of you remember that one has the condition you can meet.

772
00:50:04,961 --> 00:50:10,678
Speaker 1: that will basically get you a boost to that thing up to 75% of its total completion.

773
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:16,821
Speaker 1: and the UX does a good job, you know, like when I did my live stream I was actually looking at it and I was like, I'll bet this is how

774
00:50:16,902 --> 00:50:24,010
Speaker 0: you can tell for yeah from the tech the tech Culture trees with the boosts you can tell immediately how it works just by looking at it.

775
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:25,588
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't need anyone to explain it to you.

776
00:50:25,991 --> 00:50:30,367
Speaker 1: If you have a modicum of intelligence and you're familiar with board games, like you'll just figure it out.

777
00:50:30,548 --> 00:50:38,389
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Because it's the same system for both trees and for the entirety of every tree and the city-states use a similar system, too.

778
00:50:39,191 --> 00:50:41,778
Speaker 1: It comes down to every one of them have a crazy goal.

779
00:50:41,799 --> 00:50:44,606
Speaker 1: It's like one of them will say make three mines.

780
00:50:44,907 --> 00:50:50,930
Speaker 1: another one will say Fight against this particular kind of units more than end times.

781
00:50:51,171 --> 00:50:56,490
Speaker 0: I had one that was like kill three things using Ranged attacks or something like that.

782
00:50:56,510 --> 00:51:04,840
Speaker 1: I had one like my slingers fought a barbarian a bunch of times and then it was like yeah Slingers suck and you realize this.

783
00:51:05,121 --> 00:51:07,290
Speaker 1: and now you have a boost to researching archery.

784
00:51:08,371 --> 00:51:11,321
Speaker 1: But they can be crazy like that glory to roam.

785
00:51:11,381 --> 00:51:19,564
Speaker 1: crazy because the underlying system is 100% consistent and it's the same system across all these other systems.

786
00:51:19,604 --> 00:51:25,080
Speaker 0: like the same mechanic is used in multiple systems Here's the biggest and best changes from previous sibs, right?

787
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:28,410
Speaker 0: The number one best change of all is the workers.

788
00:51:29,031 --> 00:51:34,668
Speaker 0: Ah, so I as soon as they told me the workers were like limited use and then they go away.

789
00:51:34,688 --> 00:51:36,970
Speaker 0: I was like, oh Thank you so much.

790
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:42,470
Speaker 1: There are two kinds of people who read the initial news before we had access to the game that said workers are expendable.

791
00:51:42,971 --> 00:51:50,609
Speaker 1: Half of the people were like Scott and said thank God and half the people were like me and said oh no having visions of Final Fantasy legends.

792
00:51:51,910 --> 00:52:01,230
Speaker 1: but 100% of the people who had my initial thought when they actually played the game said oh, I see what's going on Brilliant, right?

793
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:12,100
Speaker 0: so when old sieve games you'd make a worker which kind of sucked and took a long time and Then the worker would go around working and you'd have to build roads one hex at a time Remember older games you were using.

794
00:52:12,141 --> 00:52:13,630
Speaker 1: settlers were the same thing, right?

795
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:21,090
Speaker 0: You would build improvements on every single spot of your territory that you could write that you could afford to anyway.

796
00:52:21,632 --> 00:52:26,878
Speaker 0: It was this really tedious thing you had to do you to automate your workers because it was such a pain in the ass You would.

797
00:52:26,898 --> 00:52:27,990
Speaker 0: you would build more workers.

798
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:33,510
Speaker 0: But then eventually after you had done working you have all these workers around and you're like they're costing you maintenance money.

799
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:34,609
Speaker 0: So you want to get rid of them?

800
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:35,276
Speaker 0: This is why you.

801
00:52:35,296 --> 00:52:41,470
Speaker 0: but if you got rid of them Then you'd be in trouble because you discover railroad and now suddenly you need an army of workers to upgrade all your roads.

802
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:42,670
Speaker 1: That's why you're bad at sieve.

803
00:52:42,811 --> 00:52:52,530
Speaker 1: You you know how many you need depending how big your sieve is generally and you leave them on auto Because they'll go around and get new resources and when you have a war you bring an army corps of engineers along.

804
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:58,030
Speaker 1: You've got like four workers following the army building roads and forts along the way to maintain your supply.

805
00:52:58,414 --> 00:53:00,170
Speaker 0: But anyway, the way it works now is much better.

806
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:00,551
Speaker 0: You bought.

807
00:53:00,591 --> 00:53:02,116
Speaker 0: you build a builder not a worker.

808
00:53:02,156 --> 00:53:03,942
Speaker 1: a builder and he can upgrade anything.

809
00:53:03,982 --> 00:53:12,607
Speaker 1: You can build him real easy life Like it takes a few turns which also means him getting attacked by a barbarian is not the devastating blow.

810
00:53:12,667 --> 00:53:13,790
Speaker 1: It once was right.

811
00:53:14,871 --> 00:53:16,618
Speaker 0: Also, then you tell him to build something.

812
00:53:16,678 --> 00:53:19,068
Speaker 0: He builds it immediately like BAM one.

813
00:53:19,168 --> 00:53:19,610
Speaker 0: It's done.

814
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:21,216
Speaker 0: He doesn't sit there working on it.

815
00:53:21,236 --> 00:53:24,288
Speaker 0: You're like keep a military unit defending him like mmm.

816
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:26,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, we got to take five turns to build this farm.

817
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:32,000
Speaker 0: It's like no farm done got it But you know what he doesn't build roads.

818
00:53:32,141 --> 00:53:34,629
Speaker 1: roads are an automated abstracted system.

819
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:39,690
Speaker 0: now Thank you, Jesus and the yes, so you don't have to nothing tedious with these guys, right?

820
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:42,790
Speaker 0: You pretty much send them to the bonus resources and go build build build done.

821
00:53:43,111 --> 00:53:46,425
Speaker 0: Now as and then when you get more bonus resources you build another builder.

822
00:53:46,446 --> 00:53:47,470
Speaker 1: now, here's another example.

823
00:53:47,651 --> 00:53:52,410
Speaker 0: It gives you a reason to build more builders later in the game and not just once at the beginning and then never again.

824
00:53:52,450 --> 00:54:05,905
Speaker 1: Here is another example of adding Interesting complexity and being able to do so because you've otherwise made a system more elegant and abstracted The workers because they're so much simpler for a lot of different resources.

825
00:54:06,286 --> 00:54:11,110
Speaker 1: You have two options Mm-hmm, you can improve it which is like building a mine.

826
00:54:11,231 --> 00:54:19,330
Speaker 0: Cut that shit down which is like you used to be able to chop down forests and sieve But now you can chop down fucking you can over you can like over fish and now there's no more whales.

827
00:54:19,611 --> 00:54:22,279
Speaker 1: But you got a fuck ton of gears along the way.

828
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:25,630
Speaker 0: some people actually I was watching some people play who didn't you know?

829
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:28,702
Speaker 0: And they did that by accident cut down their corn by accident.

830
00:54:28,822 --> 00:54:29,244
Speaker 1: Oh, no.

831
00:54:29,264 --> 00:54:31,934
Speaker 0: This is like oops I cut down my corn.

832
00:54:32,095 --> 00:54:33,098
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you could.

833
00:54:33,138 --> 00:54:36,950
Speaker 1: you can basically strip mine if you want which is super interesting.

834
00:54:37,411 --> 00:54:43,149
Speaker 1: The reason I think they added that is that the city's take up multiple hexes now and use cities now.

835
00:54:43,189 --> 00:54:45,397
Speaker 1: have Regular buildings and districts right?

836
00:54:45,417 --> 00:54:50,955
Speaker 0: You're not just using these workers like improve every single hex of your city like a lot of the hexes in your.

837
00:54:51,015 --> 00:55:03,522
Speaker 0: you're only really improving the bonus places and maybe a couple extra farms or something and The rest of the hexes in your city territory are being filled in with those Theater district or an encampment or something.

838
00:55:03,663 --> 00:55:14,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there's districts and there's buildings, mm-hmm and Not to get into all the details of how that works Obviously because this is just our initial thoughts based on like a small number of hours of play.

839
00:55:15,154 --> 00:55:23,190
Speaker 0: It's a pretty neat system and I can see why everyone is like There's a lot of strategy now and thinking that goes into where you're gonna position things, right?

840
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:30,970
Speaker 0: So I had a thing that was like if you your holy site gets plus one faith for every adjacent tundra.

841
00:55:31,174 --> 00:55:33,589
Speaker 0: So it's like oh shit I guess I'm putting my holy site up.

842
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:38,070
Speaker 0: I better build a city with a good holy site spot and you got a city over there.

843
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:39,178
Speaker 0: It's not even near a tundra.

844
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:40,830
Speaker 0: You don't even bother building a holy site.

845
00:55:41,011 --> 00:55:43,520
Speaker 1: I kind of ignored the water thing when I first started playing.

846
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:48,337
Speaker 1: so I'm gonna build my second city and I see this great Spot like by classic Civ heuristics.

847
00:55:48,919 --> 00:55:52,010
Speaker 1: I see this spot and I'm like, this is the god spot.

848
00:55:52,593 --> 00:55:55,830
Speaker 1: This will literally be the best city I've ever built in any civilization game ever.

849
00:55:56,273 --> 00:55:59,997
Speaker 1: I put it there and then like ten turns later It's like yo dawg.

850
00:56:00,238 --> 00:56:05,255
Speaker 1: this city's out of housing and then I realized that that city is Nowhere near fresh water.

851
00:56:05,275 --> 00:56:07,261
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm and water is the big deal.

852
00:56:07,282 --> 00:56:08,927
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, you need some water.

853
00:56:09,067 --> 00:56:09,790
Speaker 0: build some aqueduct.

854
00:56:10,052 --> 00:56:11,909
Speaker 0: Yeah, the aqueduct gives you mad houses.

855
00:56:12,263 --> 00:56:14,874
Speaker 1: Yeah and if you go the thing is the Own district.

856
00:56:15,135 --> 00:56:20,414
Speaker 1: the aqueduct only maxes out if it bridges the gap between your city and the water Mm-hmm.

857
00:56:20,696 --> 00:56:22,107
Speaker 1: Otherwise, it only gives you like two I think.

858
00:56:22,127 --> 00:56:25,780
Speaker 0: I Thought it gives you less if you already have water.

859
00:56:25,981 --> 00:56:26,222
Speaker 1: I don't.

860
00:56:26,242 --> 00:56:27,909
Speaker 1: I think it has to reach water though.

861
00:56:28,632 --> 00:56:33,430
Speaker 0: Anyway, like it is you need aqueduct or it has to get to like a mountain or something you build in one, right?

862
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:38,970
Speaker 0: But it's like when you build that encampment and like your city has oh, that's oh, I love this, right?

863
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:50,477
Speaker 0: So in old Civ games when you built walls Oh, yeah walls were basically like a thing you only built when there was a war on your doorstep and there were a pain in the ass and Didn't do anything but defend you.

864
00:56:50,618 --> 00:56:53,510
Speaker 1: or in Civ 5 there were three levels of walls.

865
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:56,109
Speaker 1: There was walls castle and I think Arsenal.

866
00:56:56,852 --> 00:56:58,698
Speaker 0: There's still levels of walls in Civ 6.

867
00:56:58,698 --> 00:57:07,990
Speaker 0: No, but in Civ 5 the levels were like real non-granular Sure, but now if you don't build walls your city does not have a built-in ranged attack.

868
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:10,862
Speaker 1: Yeah, also ancient walls power is.

869
00:57:11,023 --> 00:57:12,750
Speaker 1: now your city can attack things.

870
00:57:13,071 --> 00:57:17,850
Speaker 0: Also, if you don't have the wall your city is basically completely defenseless.

871
00:57:17,991 --> 00:57:19,924
Speaker 0: We'll just get squished by like one guy like old.

872
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:29,237
Speaker 0: It's like they made you so defenseless without the wall that you remember that even though the wall only Defends you it's like you need the wall.

873
00:57:29,257 --> 00:57:29,398
Speaker 0: like.

874
00:57:29,418 --> 00:57:42,936
Speaker 0: the wall went from something that like I only build it when is a war on My doorstep to something I build in like every city That's anywhere near a bad guy or as even any remote chance of any who are being Built it just to stop barbarians

875
00:57:43,196 --> 00:57:44,079
Speaker 1: less ye children.

876
00:57:44,119 --> 00:57:45,984
Speaker 1: forget every sieve up till five.

877
00:57:46,626 --> 00:57:50,921
Speaker 1: if a city didn't have a unit in it Boop, just take it up doesn't matter how big the city is.

878
00:57:50,941 --> 00:57:52,970
Speaker 1: You know if your capital is gone because boop.

879
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:57,385
Speaker 1: So five fix that by making cities super dangerous in their own right.

880
00:57:57,626 --> 00:57:57,947
Speaker 0: see why.

881
00:57:57,987 --> 00:57:58,650
Speaker 0: build a wall.

882
00:57:59,471 --> 00:58:03,206
Speaker 1: Six took a step halfway back and the walls are way more granular.

883
00:58:03,226 --> 00:58:05,676
Speaker 1: You can build Ancient wall.

884
00:58:05,998 --> 00:58:08,970
Speaker 0: Yeah ancient walls usually gets you through, you know for a while.

885
00:58:09,171 --> 00:58:14,147
Speaker 1: But similarly like in traditional sieve the first range unit you get is Archer.

886
00:58:14,167 --> 00:58:14,789
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

887
00:58:15,251 --> 00:58:17,919
Speaker 0: Yeah They give you an earlier range unit and then archery.

888
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:18,661
Speaker 0: do you have to?

889
00:58:18,702 --> 00:58:21,352
Speaker 0: just if you want archers you have to discover archery on Its own.

890
00:58:21,412 --> 00:58:22,618
Speaker 0: all it does is give you archers.

891
00:58:22,679 --> 00:58:23,442
Speaker 0: It's like oh, it's like.

892
00:58:23,463 --> 00:58:28,026
Speaker 0: you really don't want to research it But once you upgrade a bunch of slingers to archers, you're so happy.

893
00:58:28,047 --> 00:58:33,108
Speaker 0: Yeah Everybody because they can actually shoot two hexes not just one worthless hex.

894
00:58:33,269 --> 00:58:38,230
Speaker 0: Yep So there's one other thing they changed that I noticed that was quite significant.

895
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:40,730
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's just me imagining it but I'm pretty sure this is real.

896
00:58:41,354 --> 00:58:43,910
Speaker 0: Is that there's a lot more rock-paper-scissors with the units?

897
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:48,245
Speaker 0: So for example, usually in old sieves combined arms are necessary.

898
00:58:48,405 --> 00:58:54,185
Speaker 0: if one through five I would build spear man and spear man would be like your main melee guy.

899
00:58:54,386 --> 00:58:55,550
Speaker 0: He would defend your city.

900
00:58:55,891 --> 00:58:56,635
Speaker 0: He could attack.

901
00:58:56,977 --> 00:59:03,746
Speaker 0: he was pretty much, you know, it was a really strong Basic, you know unit that you would use in the early mid ish game.

902
00:59:03,927 --> 00:59:08,343
Speaker 0: turn into pike man Whatever and he would do like all your stuff and he was hard to kill no matter what.

903
00:59:09,026 --> 00:59:13,400
Speaker 0: now the spear man Spearman fucks up the chariots and he fucks up the horses.

904
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:19,390
Speaker 0: if you send a warrior to attack a spear man That warrior will now fuck the spear man up big time.

905
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:20,674
Speaker 0: Like a spear man has to run.

906
00:59:20,715 --> 00:59:24,870
Speaker 0: if a warriors coming and if a swordsman coming spear man really got it run away.

907
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:30,107
Speaker 0: They're in deep fucking shit, right now this same thing, but it works the same way if you got an archer, right?

908
00:59:31,512 --> 00:59:33,036
Speaker 0: And they got a warrior.

909
00:59:33,217 --> 00:59:37,269
Speaker 0: that warrior better not be two hexes away because they're getting shot down now.

910
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:40,067
Speaker 1: This is kind of dangerous for humans that play against me.

911
00:59:40,087 --> 00:59:48,057
Speaker 0: specifically There's a lot of rock-paper-scissors going on with these units and we're before and there's no unit that's like strong Just generally strong on its own.

912
00:59:48,098 --> 01:00:00,452
Speaker 1: I'd say unless you're just so technologically advanced that they can't say There's a lot more advanced wars, but really there's a lot more Fire emblem going on and also they added support units and Escorts.

913
01:00:00,492 --> 01:00:08,806
Speaker 1: so you can like combine similar units together and I can't figure out how to use the battering ram But I think you'd put it into a support unit and it makes all those.

914
01:00:08,826 --> 01:00:09,870
Speaker 1: I also did better.

915
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:21,946
Speaker 0: I also fucked up using the siege engine, but I successfully used the catapult and man that catapult takes the walls down Like I shot a catapult at an ancient wall and it like did 40% damage to it.

916
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:24,488
Speaker 0: I was like, oh shit, son.

917
01:00:25,051 --> 01:00:37,100
Speaker 1: But the the effect of all this is that Civ 5 by make by forcing the hexes and the one unit per space And all these changes individual decisions mattered more than they did in previous Civ games

918
01:00:37,341 --> 01:00:43,919
Speaker 0: and it's like you can actually think about all these decisions because they're Much more abstracted and there's a lot more of them to make.

919
01:00:43,999 --> 01:00:54,464
Speaker 1: Civ 6 has like 10 times more decisions than Civ 5 and they all Either matter a lot in the short term or matter a lot in the long term.

920
01:00:54,725 --> 01:01:00,530
Speaker 1: like no decision you make Doesn't matter in Civ 6 as far as I can see and everything is more upfront.

921
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:01,112
Speaker 0: There's like there's.

922
01:01:01,173 --> 01:01:05,230
Speaker 0: no there's nothing like a decision that you didn't realize you are making because it's hidden somewhere.

923
01:01:05,371 --> 01:01:10,947
Speaker 0: It's like everything is up and in your face like choose civics now choose science now.

924
01:01:11,531 --> 01:01:15,709
Speaker 0: Right receive five would only do that for certain things like choose the science and move your units.

925
01:01:16,251 --> 01:01:17,014
Speaker 0: There's other things.

926
01:01:17,074 --> 01:01:20,105
Speaker 0: it wouldn't even bother you now, it's like everything.

927
01:01:20,145 --> 01:01:21,350
Speaker 0: it bothers you about everything.

928
01:01:21,591 --> 01:01:21,852
Speaker 0: There's.

929
01:01:21,993 --> 01:01:26,090
Speaker 0: there's no decision that you didn't make because you were ignoring like city-states or something.

930
01:01:26,371 --> 01:01:30,450
Speaker 1: One other thing I noticed that was a nice change just for me personally.

931
01:01:30,571 --> 01:01:33,347
Speaker 1: Is that a kind of overriding theme of Civ 5?

932
01:01:33,347 --> 01:01:33,669
Speaker 1: was that?

933
01:01:34,430 --> 01:01:36,801
Speaker 1: Expanding and settling and conquering too fast.

934
01:01:37,223 --> 01:01:41,164
Speaker 1: There was a really powerful Disincentive to doing that even if you were the.

935
01:01:41,305 --> 01:01:44,469
Speaker 0: oh, yeah Six settle away just like so.

936
01:01:45,753 --> 01:01:50,807
Speaker 1: Every single sieve other than five has been fucking settle if you see a good spot.

937
01:01:50,848 --> 01:01:51,590
Speaker 1: Let's go for it.

938
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:58,542
Speaker 1: Yeah, if I was the opposite of that Civ 6 went back because I feel like Everyone kind of wanted that back.

939
01:01:58,682 --> 01:02:03,840
Speaker 0: there is one Limitation on that that I figured out by reading the rules very carefully.

940
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:07,250
Speaker 1: That's what I have not read the civil opedia at all yet.

941
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:22,029
Speaker 0: So, let's say you if you send up a builder and he builds on some mercury which is surprisingly a luxury good right that luxury good gives you four amenities that will be distributed to the cities that need amenities the most.

942
01:02:22,049 --> 01:02:27,850
Speaker 0: and So if you have five cities One of them isn't getting any mercury.

943
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:35,430
Speaker 0: So you need actually a lot of luxury goods to support a lot of cities or else you won't have enough amenities for everyone.

944
01:02:36,211 --> 01:02:39,707
Speaker 0: And oh you think just like old Sims you just build a Coliseum everywhere.

945
01:02:39,727 --> 01:02:42,223
Speaker 0: it's like no no No, the Coliseum is now a wonder.

946
01:02:42,485 --> 01:02:43,050
Speaker 0: get fucked.

947
01:02:44,374 --> 01:02:46,810
Speaker 0: If you don't have the Coliseum you're in deep shit.

948
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:50,303
Speaker 0: But if you do have the Coliseum you got more amenities than you know to do with.

949
01:02:50,384 --> 01:02:51,468
Speaker 0: everyone else can get fucked.

950
01:02:51,508 --> 01:02:54,354
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Mean Civ 5 was similar.

951
01:02:54,374 --> 01:02:58,589
Speaker 1: But again, the system now is consistent with the other systems amenities, right?

952
01:02:59,050 --> 01:03:00,054
Speaker 0: But the point is similar.

953
01:03:00,074 --> 01:03:05,538
Speaker 0: the point is if you expand too much you need lots and lots of amenities to cut But you don't need anything else right?

954
01:03:05,558 --> 01:03:08,911
Speaker 0: because each city can have plenty of housing and be fun, you know Yeah But yeah You can.

955
01:03:09,031 --> 01:03:19,627
Speaker 0: you can definitely expand and conquer much more freely like you could in the old days not be worried about like oh no Unhappiness from too much population or oh no unhappiness from too many cities.

956
01:03:19,647 --> 01:03:21,154
Speaker 0: It's like no no I'm happy.

957
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:27,680
Speaker 0: only reason you would have unhappiness is not enough amenities per city And it's a lot easier to think about in your head.

958
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:30,230
Speaker 0: Like do I have enough amenity points for all these cities?

959
01:03:30,571 --> 01:03:31,355
Speaker 0: Yes, it's like.

960
01:03:31,375 --> 01:03:33,326
Speaker 0: do I have enough food to feed my people in Agricola?

961
01:03:33,346 --> 01:03:33,910
Speaker 0: It's the same thing.

962
01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:37,970
Speaker 1: Though what I noticed is that the result of all these changes too is that there's a lot more uniqueness.

963
01:03:38,111 --> 01:03:47,430
Speaker 1: So like in Civ 5 if you have cities The only thing that'll differentiate cities from other cities other than their size is is it more production focused or?

964
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:48,997
Speaker 1: Culture focused?

965
01:03:49,078 --> 01:03:50,208
Speaker 1: is it on the sea or not on this?

966
01:03:50,228 --> 01:03:50,892
Speaker 0: Yeah Now you have.

967
01:03:50,932 --> 01:04:04,870
Speaker 0: now you have a culture city have a religion city like every city having everything, you know It's sort of everything is super unique and every city-state is Specifically unique in what it and you can't have a hundred wonders in one city because they've got a hundred hexes.

968
01:04:04,890 --> 01:04:06,196
Speaker 0: You got to put the wonder on a hex.

969
01:04:06,437 --> 01:04:09,049
Speaker 0: No, you got to put everything on a hex somewhere, right?

970
01:04:10,272 --> 01:04:12,204
Speaker 0: Now this let's talk about the problems of the games.

971
01:04:12,224 --> 01:04:15,149
Speaker 0: the problem number one The biggest problem is the UI has some issues.

972
01:04:15,633 --> 01:04:18,554
Speaker 0: Yeah has some good parts a lot of good parts But also some issues.

973
01:04:18,694 --> 01:04:24,015
Speaker 0: one issue for example is like at least for me unit control is like a problem A lot of times.

974
01:04:24,076 --> 01:04:26,670
Speaker 0: anybody like this unit has not moved yet.

975
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:29,189
Speaker 0: So I'll click on that unit and then it like doesn't let me move it.

976
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:31,801
Speaker 0: It doesn't let me move it like or so part of that is.

977
01:04:31,861 --> 01:04:35,878
Speaker 1: I figured out they change movement rules In every save up to this point.

978
01:04:36,279 --> 01:04:38,850
Speaker 1: say you have three movement and you're on rough terrain.

979
01:04:38,951 --> 01:04:41,849
Speaker 1: It doesn't count the train you're on when you start to move.

980
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:51,321
Speaker 1: But and you can sort of cheat with that like go over a river at the end of your movements at the beginning And there's all this stuff you could do it sort of always round it up in the new sieve.

981
01:04:51,843 --> 01:04:54,010
Speaker 1: It effectively always rounds down.

982
01:04:54,854 --> 01:04:57,330
Speaker 1: So you'll often not have enough movement.

983
01:04:57,511 --> 01:05:00,843
Speaker 1: It'll say you have a couple movement left, but it always rounds against you.

984
01:05:00,863 --> 01:05:03,131
Speaker 1: So you end up not moving where you expected Hmm.

985
01:05:03,713 --> 01:05:05,177
Speaker 0: Oh one other thing that forgot.

986
01:05:05,197 --> 01:05:07,262
Speaker 0: that's good for unit promotions.

987
01:05:07,664 --> 01:05:09,830
Speaker 0: you heal when you promote but you can't move that turn.

988
01:05:10,271 --> 01:05:13,062
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like promoting is a discrete action, which is really nice.

989
01:05:13,082 --> 01:05:14,748
Speaker 0: I like it better this way.

990
01:05:15,451 --> 01:05:18,280
Speaker 0: So anyway other other bad things about sieve six.

991
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:21,250
Speaker 1: so perhaps I can never figure out what to click on and have these interfaces.

992
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:32,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, so for example a lot of things don't stand out enough like in like scooby-doo like in scooby-doo when you watch us You know There's always like they're running and they're going between all the doors in the hallway with that gag.

993
01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:40,082
Speaker 0: that's in every single episode and you can always tell like when something's gonna be Animated because it's on the cell and not on the background and it looks different.

994
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:42,510
Speaker 0: it stands out in this sieve six.

995
01:05:42,711 --> 01:05:47,070
Speaker 0: I can't even tell when I found what did they rename it to the tribal village which used to be the room?

996
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:51,427
Speaker 1: Three when I was playing it and I didn't grab them because I didn't realize what they were.

997
01:05:51,487 --> 01:05:54,136
Speaker 0: yet in Sieve every other sieve game ever.

998
01:05:54,176 --> 01:05:55,200
Speaker 1: It's like oh my god.

999
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:56,404
Speaker 0: There's a hut on this hex.

1000
01:05:56,524 --> 01:05:58,290
Speaker 0: touch it and sieve six.

1001
01:05:58,370 --> 01:06:01,846
Speaker 0: It's like it tells you but it doesn't tell you loud enough and clear enough.

1002
01:06:01,866 --> 01:06:07,290
Speaker 1: Like you can't see it It's like or even worse at a glance the the like the fog of war and it looks really cool.

1003
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:11,650
Speaker 0: It looks it's really beautiful, but it's hard to see what's going on.

1004
01:06:12,190 --> 01:06:15,804
Speaker 1: Can't tell without thinking about it if it's territory.

1005
01:06:15,844 --> 01:06:18,113
Speaker 1: I haven't explored or territory I'm just not looking at.

1006
01:06:18,234 --> 01:06:26,330
Speaker 0: yeah, and it's like even if you use the strategic view, which is like the 2d board game view It's really hard to tell what's going on because there's so much stuff in these hexes.

1007
01:06:26,370 --> 01:06:28,750
Speaker 0: Like you got a district and you got a resource and you got it.

1008
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:31,708
Speaker 0: It's like you cannot see what is happening on all these hexes.

1009
01:06:32,210 --> 01:06:34,500
Speaker 0: It doesn't let you zoom in or out or make hex.

1010
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:36,970
Speaker 0: I wish I could we even just I wish I could make hexes bigger.

1011
01:06:37,131 --> 01:06:44,607
Speaker 1: It's like a you know, see all the stuff that's in them more clear Just in the UX like the buttons and they never shine enough or pop enough to remind you like.

1012
01:06:44,647 --> 01:06:45,611
Speaker 1: this is the thing to click On.

1013
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:47,336
Speaker 1: so I literally kept trying to figure out.

1014
01:06:47,376 --> 01:06:51,570
Speaker 1: I could not figure out how to assign an envoy to a city-state.

1015
01:06:51,671 --> 01:06:53,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, because it's a little left and right arrow.

1016
01:06:53,611 --> 01:06:58,850
Speaker 1: It's these ornate looking arrows that look like accents just like wedge down to the side of this icon.

1017
01:06:59,050 --> 01:07:01,958
Speaker 1: Yep, and that the interface is rife with that.

1018
01:07:01,998 --> 01:07:02,379
Speaker 1: like it's.

1019
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:11,079
Speaker 1: it could be a good UX but the UI is just not obvious or intuitive or Visible or like it has deep deep problems.

1020
01:07:11,239 --> 01:07:14,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's definitely a lot of things going on that are not so hot.

1021
01:07:14,890 --> 01:07:17,619
Speaker 0: Yeah, the mini-map is like impossible to use.

1022
01:07:17,719 --> 01:07:21,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can't zoom out enough, which instead five was kind of okay.

1023
01:07:21,490 --> 01:07:26,350
Speaker 0: But if you do zoom out You won't be able to tell what's going on because you just be a mess of like it'll be like a pile of junk.

1024
01:07:26,450 --> 01:07:27,635
Speaker 0: You can't tell what's happening.

1025
01:07:27,695 --> 01:07:29,501
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's none of the hexes are clear enough.

1026
01:07:29,802 --> 01:07:34,738
Speaker 1: Yeah, just everything is kind of cluttered and I guess I'm just gonna have to get used to it.

1027
01:07:34,839 --> 01:07:37,390
Speaker 0: No, like there isn't really a city screen anymore.

1028
01:07:37,704 --> 01:07:38,493
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like a little.

1029
01:07:38,513 --> 01:07:45,570
Speaker 0: there's a little thing in the bottom right and then you have to click on this button and that'll open a Big thing on the left that has way too much fucking information in it.

1030
01:07:45,710 --> 01:07:50,810
Speaker 0: Right when all I really want to see is just how many do I have enough amenities and do I have enough housing?

1031
01:07:51,712 --> 01:07:54,566
Speaker 0: All this other info in there that I ignore because I don't know what the hell it means or if

1032
01:07:54,606 --> 01:07:58,341
Speaker 1: I want to see my People or any of that stuff is like all these extra sub buttons

1033
01:07:58,441 --> 01:08:04,009
Speaker 0: and I can't like push left and right to like scroll through My cities I can't get if I don't know if it exists and I just can't find it.

1034
01:08:04,372 --> 01:08:06,670
Speaker 0: I can't find like a unit list anywhere.

1035
01:08:07,252 --> 01:08:12,270
Speaker 0: I want cuz like I want to upgrade all of my you know slingers to archers this turn.

1036
01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:14,483
Speaker 0: I just discovered archery and I haven't moved them yet.

1037
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:15,589
Speaker 0: And I know I've got a bunch of money.

1038
01:08:16,671 --> 01:08:17,977
Speaker 0: I can't just like go through them all.

1039
01:08:18,057 --> 01:08:25,510
Speaker 1: one and it's like it's not a Civ 5 did a much better job of having Screens that show you the information you actually want in an intuitive manner.

1040
01:08:26,214 --> 01:08:29,290
Speaker 0: They did add some stuff to help with the management of a ton of units though.

1041
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:32,703
Speaker 0: You can group units together into core and then later in the game into armies.

1042
01:08:32,823 --> 01:08:34,350
Speaker 1: and you can also like with settlers.

1043
01:08:34,491 --> 01:08:35,354
Speaker 1: You can have an escort.

1044
01:08:35,737 --> 01:08:38,590
Speaker 0: Yeah the at your link two guys together and then you just move them all at once.

1045
01:08:38,691 --> 01:08:39,718
Speaker 0: It makes things a lot easier.

1046
01:08:39,738 --> 01:08:43,529
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't have to be like, oh shit I move my settlers you far my warrior can't catch.

1047
01:08:43,529 --> 01:08:54,010
Speaker 1: So they also did something clever in Civ 5 with cities while the city UI is garbage in Civ 6. in Civ 5 You could manually assign your dudes or you could check a focus.

1048
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:58,870
Speaker 1: So you could say like focus on culture focus on gold focused on production focus on great people focus on science.

1049
01:09:00,192 --> 01:09:07,490
Speaker 1: Civ 6 does this so much better But it doesn't tell you it's doing it unless you really like you notice because the UI is again garbage.

1050
01:09:08,435 --> 01:09:09,742
Speaker 1: It shows all those same things.

1051
01:09:10,084 --> 01:09:13,917
Speaker 1: if you click on one It highlights it and says focus on this.

1052
01:09:14,861 --> 01:09:17,830
Speaker 1: if you click on another it focuses on both.

1053
01:09:18,951 --> 01:09:24,250
Speaker 1: So you can say focus on and things and it'll tune the city toward those things.

1054
01:09:24,411 --> 01:09:27,926
Speaker 1: Obviously the more you pick the less full focus you'll get.

1055
01:09:28,287 --> 01:09:31,859
Speaker 1: but you could say Focus on food and gears and forget everything else.

1056
01:09:32,562 --> 01:09:37,076
Speaker 1: You can also click on something and say avoid this And you can combine the two.

1057
01:09:37,116 --> 01:09:43,027
Speaker 1: so you can say fuck religion really go hard on science Really go hard on food and let everything else be default.

1058
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:49,287
Speaker 1: That's real clever and cool, but it is a bad UI and it's not obvious.

1059
01:09:49,327 --> 01:09:50,130
Speaker 1: That's what it's doing.

1060
01:09:50,411 --> 01:09:53,890
Speaker 0: So one thing that's good and bad I found is the great peoples.

1061
01:09:54,512 --> 01:09:55,695
Speaker 0: So you get great people play.

1062
01:09:55,715 --> 01:09:59,927
Speaker 1: I did not realize until I read something that those are individual great people.

1063
01:09:59,947 --> 01:10:00,770
Speaker 1: you're all fighting over.

1064
01:10:00,973 --> 01:10:02,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is crazy.

1065
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:05,150
Speaker 0: So you get great people points and you get enough great people points.

1066
01:10:05,230 --> 01:10:13,101
Speaker 0: You can buy a great people and it's like it's almost a lot like a board game where there's a bunch of great people Available face up like tickets a ride and it's like

1067
01:10:13,623 --> 01:10:14,024
Speaker 1: I got

1068
01:10:14,064 --> 01:10:19,215
Speaker 0: him and now that one is mine And he does something different than every other great Scientist that you could get.

1069
01:10:19,235 --> 01:10:26,719
Speaker 0: and then they draw a new great scientist from the virtual deck who is now the face-up great Scientist and the next person was enough points to get.

1070
01:10:26,919 --> 01:10:29,687
Speaker 0: great scientists can get him or her or whatever.

1071
01:10:29,707 --> 01:10:37,359
Speaker 0: So It's like a drafting board game to get the currently available Great person and you're like racing to get enough points.

1072
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:43,789
Speaker 0: if it's one you like and if it's one you don't like you can Pass and wait for the next one or whatever to get one that you do like.

1073
01:10:44,632 --> 01:10:45,937
Speaker 0: The problem I have with the grand.

1074
01:10:45,957 --> 01:10:48,646
Speaker 0: that's really fun, you know a board game like a mechanic.

1075
01:10:48,687 --> 01:10:49,690
Speaker 0: it's easier to understand.

1076
01:10:49,851 --> 01:10:50,413
Speaker 0: It's unique.

1077
01:10:50,474 --> 01:10:52,061
Speaker 0: the great people do specific things.

1078
01:10:52,081 --> 01:11:00,073
Speaker 0: It's more flavorful, you know It's easier to understand like progress towards great person because you can look at that screen, you know The heart.

1079
01:11:00,113 --> 01:11:10,510
Speaker 0: the problem is is that a lot of the great in Civ 5 The great people had like multi purposes a lot of the time and you could always do something with a great person.

1080
01:11:10,590 --> 01:11:12,659
Speaker 0: It was very rarely a time we have they always.

1081
01:11:12,679 --> 01:11:15,510
Speaker 1: they always had a long-term option than a short-term option, right?

1082
01:11:15,610 --> 01:11:18,670
Speaker 0: It's like you have a great engineer and you didn't have something you want.

1083
01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:19,696
Speaker 0: It's like insta build.

1084
01:11:19,937 --> 01:11:21,787
Speaker 0: you could just build like the factory.

1085
01:11:21,827 --> 01:11:25,046
Speaker 0: you could build the Manufactory and you could get a use out of the great person.

1086
01:11:25,086 --> 01:11:32,070
Speaker 0: no matter what You know, you got a great artist for example, and you didn't have a slot for a great work of art.

1087
01:11:32,331 --> 01:11:35,750
Speaker 0: You could send the artist to another civilization to mess with them, right?

1088
01:11:36,339 --> 01:11:38,538
Speaker 0: You know There's always something you could do with a great person.

1089
01:11:38,599 --> 01:11:45,442
Speaker 0: now a lot of times like I got a great scientist When I was playing and to activate this great scientist ability.

1090
01:11:45,783 --> 01:11:46,766
Speaker 0: I needed a holy site.

1091
01:11:47,307 --> 01:11:48,230
Speaker 0: I didn't have a holy site.

1092
01:11:48,553 --> 01:11:49,726
Speaker 0: I didn't know how to make a holy site.

1093
01:11:49,746 --> 01:11:51,153
Speaker 0: I It was.

1094
01:11:51,314 --> 01:11:53,902
Speaker 0: I did and there was nothing else a great scientist could do.

1095
01:11:53,922 --> 01:11:57,232
Speaker 0: it was useless unless you had a holy site to activate His ability.

1096
01:11:57,493 --> 01:12:10,808
Speaker 0: he just did nothing except take up a space on the board and clutter up my UI more with this little beaker symbol Yep, and it's like if I get a great person no matter what else is true about my civilization I should be able to do something with them.

1097
01:12:12,530 --> 01:12:13,495
Speaker 0: Suboptimal is fine.

1098
01:12:13,515 --> 01:12:24,270
Speaker 0: It should be more than nothing because I spent my great people points and you know even if You know, it's like yeah, you could tell me I should have skipped and waited for the next great person to come along.

1099
01:12:24,751 --> 01:12:29,046
Speaker 0: But it's like like why did I earn all those great people points for right?

1100
01:12:29,247 --> 01:12:29,990
Speaker 0: I want something now.

1101
01:12:30,392 --> 01:12:34,369
Speaker 0: I don't want to wait for something else and let someone else have that thing, you know Yep.

1102
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:39,489
Speaker 0: So I guess in the I ended up there a lot of times where I wasn't able to get enough slots to use.

1103
01:12:39,549 --> 01:12:42,870
Speaker 0: I like Tons of great artists and writers and there was nothing I could bill.

1104
01:12:43,051 --> 01:12:47,310
Speaker 0: I had already built everything to give me slots to get a great art slots and writing slots.

1105
01:12:47,671 --> 01:12:48,795
Speaker 0: I had libraries and shit.

1106
01:12:49,176 --> 01:12:51,363
Speaker 0: I needed more slots and I didn't have enough.

1107
01:12:51,383 --> 01:12:53,410
Speaker 0: I had way more great people than slots.

1108
01:12:54,092 --> 01:13:05,008
Speaker 0: Nothing to do now, this is not a review because we've played so I've played it for like Days, I've never even gotten past like the Renaissance.

1109
01:13:05,269 --> 01:13:17,308
Speaker 1: Yep So we'll obviously review the game later, but this is the first time in the 11 years We've been doing gig nights that a sieved a new sieve game came out and was immediately full on.

1110
01:13:18,676 --> 01:13:21,263
Speaker 1: So Sieve five we could basically review.

1111
01:13:21,283 --> 01:13:24,175
Speaker 0: three was pre geek nights We were at RIT and four.

1112
01:13:24,215 --> 01:13:34,223
Speaker 1: four was early geek nights five was mid and six is now so four and five we could review pretty much fully Shortly after they came out and then review again when the expansions came out.

1113
01:13:34,665 --> 01:13:36,130
Speaker 1: This one is full on right away.

1114
01:13:36,712 --> 01:13:45,967
Speaker 1: It's gonna take me like a month of playing it to have a full sense of if I'm gonna 100% migrate to this one or If sieve five is still got a lot of staying power.

1115
01:13:46,008 --> 01:13:55,583
Speaker 0: for me it depends on how much they patch right because I think you know, they know it's not perfect and we'll see what kind of fixes and changes come through and if they make things better or worse or any.

1116
01:13:55,623 --> 01:14:00,899
Speaker 1: and also mad props to them for taking the Aggressive approach of not going back to baby mode.

1117
01:14:00,939 --> 01:14:04,090
Speaker 1: They basically said fuck it and started with brave new world.

1118
01:14:04,832 --> 01:14:11,170
Speaker 1: So they introduced a lot of stuff in a hurry in a new game, which could put off players.

1119
01:14:11,230 --> 01:14:13,037
Speaker 1: I'm really curious to see how the reception goes.

1120
01:14:13,398 --> 01:14:15,265
Speaker 0: Well, they currently I believe.

1121
01:14:15,325 --> 01:14:24,650
Speaker 0: I read somewhere that the maximum Simultaneous players of sieve six on Steam at one time has already beaten sieve fives record for that same statistic.

1122
01:14:25,104 --> 01:14:31,927
Speaker 0: You know I believe that partly because it's like at launch everyone starts playing sieve six how many people are playing all at once?

1123
01:14:32,148 --> 01:14:32,569
Speaker 0: X number?

1124
01:14:33,311 --> 01:14:36,989
Speaker 0: Sieve five has never reached that number that high for simultaneous players all at once.

1125
01:14:37,271 --> 01:14:44,080
Speaker 1: It might partly be that it's getting to be especially in the States the time of the year when you'll sit at home and play A game like this for four hours.

1126
01:14:44,341 --> 01:14:44,563
Speaker 0: Yep.

1127
01:14:44,764 --> 01:14:45,146
Speaker 0: It's cold.

1128
01:14:45,448 --> 01:14:48,446
Speaker 1: Yep This was the proper time to release this game.

1129
01:14:48,506 --> 01:14:50,766
Speaker 0: I think Everything's getting released now.

1130
01:14:50,786 --> 01:14:52,294
Speaker 0: It's really so.

1131
01:14:52,314 --> 01:14:54,969
Speaker 1: yeah expect a much deeper review in like a month.
