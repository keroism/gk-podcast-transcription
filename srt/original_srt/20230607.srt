1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,869
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, June 7th, 2023.

2
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:10,110
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:13,657
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,004
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,024 --> 00:00:19,339
Speaker 0: Tonight we are talking about Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse.

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,398
Speaker 1: Let's do this!

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:29,680
Speaker 0: So, uh, you didn't look at the news and you don't live in the entire northeast of the United States or, like, eastern Canada.

8
00:00:30,261 --> 00:00:39,320
Speaker 0: You might not realize that, uh, shit's on fire and New York City was covered in a, like, black and orange cloud of death all day today.

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,500
Speaker 1: The AQI right now is 364.

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,097
Speaker 0: That is at the levels where, like, it is harmful to health and life.

11
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:55,860
Speaker 1: According to AirNow.gov, a level of 301 says everyone should stay indoors and reduce activity levels.

12
00:00:56,481 --> 00:00:56,741
Speaker 0: Yup.

13
00:00:57,402 --> 00:01:08,280
Speaker 0: I mean, up until this point, the worst AQI I've ever experienced in my life was during a particularly bad burn in Malaysia while I was in Singapore during F1, like, a decade or more ago.

14
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,561
Speaker 0: And it was around 400, 450.

15
00:01:09,561 --> 00:01:24,020
Speaker 0: And when I stepped outside of my hotel, I literally collapsed into an uncontrolled coughing fit and had to stagger back into the hotel and could not leave my hotel for a couple days.

16
00:01:24,361 --> 00:01:30,680
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, like, I'm trying to, the thing that astonishes me is that, like, okay, let's say you got a campfire, right?

17
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,894
Speaker 1: And it's like, you can't stand downwind of the campfire.

18
00:01:32,914 --> 00:01:33,740
Speaker 1: You'd be like, huh, right?

19
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:38,000
Speaker 1: That's probably, like, AQI of a few hundred, right?

20
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:41,300
Speaker 0: But you can walk around the campfire to get away from it.

21
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,300
Speaker 1: And it doesn't, you don't have to walk that far away from the campfire before it's basically nothing anymore, right?

22
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,180
Speaker 1: It's like, you gotta get pretty close to, like, a charcoal grill to actually smell it, right?

23
00:01:51,863 --> 00:01:56,160
Speaker 1: So, the fires in Canada are so numerous and so large.

24
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,280
Speaker 0: They said something like 90 million acres have been ruined to ash.

25
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:13,260
Speaker 1: Right, so it's like, if you are in this huge, huge area, right, like, you know, an enormous area like the entire, like, northeast of North America, right?

26
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,499
Speaker 0: The sheer tens of millions of people affected by this.

27
00:02:17,081 --> 00:02:23,759
Speaker 1: But it's like, anywhere in that area, it's still, like, campfire strength, right?

28
00:02:24,221 --> 00:02:28,428
Speaker 1: So, I cracked- I'm hundreds of miles away, it's still campfire strength.

29
00:02:28,608 --> 00:02:32,920
Speaker 1: What could it possibly be if you're right next to it, like, you're right next to a campfire?

30
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,986
Speaker 0: So, you know what that is?

31
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,100
Speaker 0: You know what that is if you were near these fires?

32
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,860
Speaker 0: Because remember, my father was a firefighter, his father was a firefighter, and his other was a firefighter.

33
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:45,620
Speaker 0: I am the first non-firefighter in my family as far back as we know on my dad's side.

34
00:02:46,342 --> 00:02:48,186
Speaker 0: And, uh, I know a lot about fires.

35
00:02:48,928 --> 00:02:54,180
Speaker 0: If you're that close to that type of air quality, that is what kills most people in fires.

36
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,706
Speaker 0: Very few people are killed by heat or by burning.

37
00:02:56,946 --> 00:02:59,011
Speaker 0: They are killed by that air.

38
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,557
Speaker 0: The air is just deadly to life.

39
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:02,660
Speaker 0: Full stop.

40
00:03:03,741 --> 00:03:06,380
Speaker 1: So, it's, uh, yeah, it's pretty bad.

41
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,369
Speaker 0: This is a horrific, deadly situation.

42
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,040
Speaker 0: People are definitely dying, and we're going to find out about it later.

43
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:22,960
Speaker 0: Like, this is an absolute disaster, and it might not get a lot better in the foreseeable future because Canada doesn't really have a good way to control these fires.

44
00:03:23,961 --> 00:03:32,600
Speaker 0: Uh, they are spending all of their resources right now just trying to fight the fires that are approaching settlements and housing and infrastructure.

45
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,459
Speaker 0: Most of the fires are so remote that they can't even easily get to them.

46
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:43,258
Speaker 1: So, I think what we've got to do is, here's the thing, people are like, "Oh, oh, big fan,

47
00:03:43,298 --> 00:03:43,459
Speaker 1: nuke.".

48
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,203
Speaker 1: Hold on.

49
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:45,515
Speaker 1: The people are like,

50
00:03:45,555 --> 00:03:45,736
Speaker 1: "Hey."

51
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:46,320
Speaker 1: Van Kars?

52
00:03:47,162 --> 00:03:47,323
Speaker 1: No.

53
00:03:47,566 --> 00:03:48,820
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, that doesn't hurt.

54
00:03:49,701 --> 00:03:53,187
Speaker 1: The people are like, "Oh, these fires, they're caused by climate change,".

55
00:03:53,207 --> 00:03:59,720
Speaker 1: because it dried everything out, and then lightning hit the trees, and then it doesn't rain, and you have a problem, right?

56
00:04:00,522 --> 00:04:01,143
Speaker 1: But you know what?

57
00:04:01,263 --> 00:04:09,260
Speaker 1: Climate change can also be the answer, because if we melt the ice caps, the water will flood all of Canada, and then they can't set on fire.

58
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,545
Speaker 1: So, right?

59
00:04:12,006 --> 00:04:13,731
Speaker 1: The problem is also the solution.

60
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:17,000
Speaker 1: We're just in this non-equilibrium state right now.

61
00:04:18,362 --> 00:04:19,404
Speaker 0: We don't have enough.

62
00:04:19,906 --> 00:04:25,120
Speaker 1: We can have less climate change, and it would be problem-solved, but more climate change would also be problem-solved.

63
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:29,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, Waterworld definitely portrayed a healthy quality of life for all the people involved.

64
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,547
Speaker 1: Listen, Waterworld, whatever you want to say about it, was not on fire.

65
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:35,652
Speaker 1: The air quality was good.

66
00:04:36,854 --> 00:04:39,440
Speaker 1: You could breathe on Waterworld above the water.

67
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:45,691
Speaker 1: Not under the water, but if you had your head above the water in Waterworld, at least you could breathe.

68
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,419
Speaker 1: You know, drinking, eating, those are problems, but breathing.

69
00:04:50,785 --> 00:04:57,400
Speaker 0: But the worst part is, no one can say- Would you rather live on Waterworld, or only Landworld?

70
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, both of them just kill everybody.

71
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,873
Speaker 1: Only Landworld.

72
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:03,358
Speaker 1: Land only.

73
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:11,260
Speaker 0: I feel like I would like the largest and most powerful things that have ever existed, which are human governments, to do something about this.

74
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:12,747
Speaker 1: I mean, they are doing.

75
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:14,519
Speaker 1: They have the resources that they have.

76
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,725
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, out of grander scale.

77
00:05:16,765 --> 00:05:18,869
Speaker 0: They're not doing something about climate change.

78
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:23,560
Speaker 0: They're doing the bare minimum to prevent people from just rioting about it.

79
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,399
Speaker 0: And half the people don't even believe it's real.

80
00:05:27,141 --> 00:05:28,179
Speaker 1: Oh, it depends where you are.

81
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if you average it out, a lot of people don't believe any of this is real.

82
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,189
Speaker 0: But this is deadly, and we don't know when it's going to end.

83
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,875
Speaker 0: No one can forecast this, because the fires aren't slowing down.

84
00:05:39,436 --> 00:05:40,980
Speaker 0: More fires are likely to start.

85
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:51,920
Speaker 0: And for us, in the New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut area, the only thing that determines how bad it gets for us is which jet stream is active.

86
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:58,660
Speaker 0: And because climate change has fucked up all the models for weather patterns, it can't really be predicted.

87
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:04,940
Speaker 0: So if the jet stream comes from the east, it'll actually keep the smoke away from us, and our air will go back to normal.

88
00:06:05,461 --> 00:06:10,733
Speaker 0: If it comes down and across like it is now, the wind doesn't blow the smoke away.

89
00:06:10,814 --> 00:06:13,560
Speaker 0: It literally just brings more and more and more smoke.

90
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:24,700
Speaker 0: But if fires start in Pennsylvania, which are very likely because very similar conditions exist there, including something that if you've never heard of it that's terrifying, called a dry thunderstorm, which is bad news bears.

91
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,500
Speaker 1: Doesn't Pennsylvania still have the town where the coal is on fire?

92
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,094
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, that town's still on fire.

93
00:06:29,115 --> 00:06:29,619
Speaker 0: Centralia.

94
00:06:30,443 --> 00:06:30,738
Speaker 1: Okay.

95
00:06:32,402 --> 00:06:36,180
Speaker 0: That fire is nothing compared to what's going on up in Canada right now.

96
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,040
Speaker 1: Well, obviously, otherwise we'd smell it, right?

97
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:44,009
Speaker 0: So this is affecting geek nights, actually, because I stayed home all day.

98
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:49,520
Speaker 0: We live in a building that has really good air filtration, and we have a bunch of giant HEPA filters.

99
00:06:50,221 --> 00:07:00,395
Speaker 0: But despite that, and literally not going outside at all and running all these filters at max, since yesterday, my throat hurts, my eyes hurt.

100
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:02,037
Speaker 0: Like, I am tired.

101
00:07:02,137 --> 00:07:03,299
Speaker 0: I can smell burning.

102
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,380
Speaker 0: This sucks.

103
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,203
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like yesterday.

104
00:07:06,363 --> 00:07:08,229
Speaker 1: it was like, "Ooh, that's bad, right?

105
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:09,954
Speaker 1: Wear a mask when you go outside.

106
00:07:10,356 --> 00:07:11,580
Speaker 1: You know, don't go outside too

107
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:11,700
Speaker 1: much.".

108
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,780
Speaker 0: Today is literally don't go outside unless it is an absolute emergency.

109
00:07:16,301 --> 00:07:18,565
Speaker 1: Today is, like, way, way worse.

110
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,490
Speaker 1: I didn't realize it was gonna get so, like, twice as bad.

111
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,135
Speaker 1: Like, yesterday I could see the World Trade Center.

112
00:07:24,155 --> 00:07:24,936
Speaker 1: It was a little blurry.

113
00:07:25,176 --> 00:07:27,220
Speaker 1: I could see the Empire State Building, no problem, right?

114
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,411
Speaker 1: Today, the Empire State Building is gone.

115
00:07:29,712 --> 00:07:31,040
Speaker 1: World Trade Center, gone.

116
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,693
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was in a meeting earlier today, like, for work.

117
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:34,940
Speaker 0: I was presenting this big thing.

118
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,599
Speaker 1: The visibility is, like, half.

119
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:48,477
Speaker 0: Just toward the end of the presentation, it suddenly, like, over the course of about a minute, got so dark that I assumed, like, a huge cloud came over or something.

120
00:07:48,497 --> 00:07:50,280
Speaker 0: I didn't think much about it because I was focused on my work.

121
00:07:50,861 --> 00:07:52,463
Speaker 0: And it just kept getting dark and dark.

122
00:07:52,664 --> 00:07:56,150
Speaker 0: And finally my meeting ends and I stand up and, like, go look behind the screen behind me.

123
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,476
Speaker 0: And it's just orange outside.

124
00:07:59,556 --> 00:08:02,020
Speaker 0: Like, this deep orange like I'm wearing sunglasses.

125
00:08:02,961 --> 00:08:03,141
Speaker 1: Yep.

126
00:08:03,622 --> 00:08:06,867
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was orange for a little bit today, around, like, two-ish.

127
00:08:07,328 --> 00:08:12,336
Speaker 1: But then it just, it stayed, you know, the visibility kept declining, but the orange became white again.

128
00:08:12,376 --> 00:08:14,420
Speaker 1: So I don't know what causes the color change.

129
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:24,357
Speaker 0: Ah, so that is caused by the angle of the sun and the relative amounts of the different sizes of particles in different layers of the local atmosphere.

130
00:08:24,377 --> 00:08:25,840
Speaker 0: Again, firefighter dad.

131
00:08:26,582 --> 00:08:31,120
Speaker 1: So I guess at two o'clock the sun angle made it be orange, but then not anymore at three.

132
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,559
Speaker 0: But also the density of certain particles might have been different and the air might have been static for a while.

133
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,202
Speaker 1: I don't know.

134
00:08:37,342 --> 00:08:38,044
Speaker 1: It's just getting real.

135
00:08:38,105 --> 00:08:39,330
Speaker 1: It was, it's still getting worse.

136
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,736
Speaker 1: It hasn't gotten better since two.

137
00:08:40,816 --> 00:08:41,700
Speaker 1: It just got less orange.

138
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,020
Speaker 0: Yeah.

139
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:53,200
Speaker 0: So I guess what I'd say is if the AQI, which you can look up in most places around you or in the place you are for the foreseeable future, is above a hundred.

140
00:08:53,821 --> 00:08:56,686
Speaker 0: Now, above 50 is already not great for people.

141
00:08:57,067 --> 00:08:58,509
Speaker 0: Like, that is already a problem.

142
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:04,780
Speaker 0: But if it's above a hundred, I am earnestly imploring you to not go outside if you can avoid it.

143
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:12,088
Speaker 0: And if it's above 200, don't even, like, work out or, like, exercise or even do anything strenuous indoors.

144
00:09:12,188 --> 00:09:22,880
Speaker 0: Like, do as little as possible because particulate matter, these 2.5, this PM 2.5 metric, those are particles so fine that it's not just like they get in your lungs and make you cough.

145
00:09:23,323 --> 00:09:25,760
Speaker 0: They can cause permanent damage to your lungs.

146
00:09:26,381 --> 00:09:26,541
Speaker 1: Yeah.

147
00:09:26,561 --> 00:09:31,840
Speaker 1: It's like if you go outside today, it's like that might as well be the same as, like, deciding to start smoking tobacco.

148
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,560
Speaker 0: Probably worse because of the sheer density and the fact that your lungs don't get a break.

149
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,870
Speaker 1: Well, and the fact that, yeah, if you smoke cigarettes, it's like you do that.

150
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,760
Speaker 1: Even if you're a chain smoker, you do that a few times a day.

151
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,206
Speaker 0: This is not like smoking a pack of cigarettes.

152
00:09:46,246 --> 00:09:52,040
Speaker 0: This is like every single breath you take is through three cigarettes simultaneously all day.

153
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:53,060
Speaker 1: Yeah.

154
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,980
Speaker 0: This is like Donald Duck smoking those cigarettes in that one Disney cartoon.

155
00:09:59,962 --> 00:10:00,870
Speaker 0: Like, this is rough and...

156
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:18,700
Speaker 1: One thing that does bother me, though, is that, you know, when the AQI is bad, right, I guess, you know, in this situation, it's a little different, but when the AQI is bad, the warnings are always, like, don't go outside, don't exercise, don't go biking, don't go walking, don't go running, right?

157
00:10:19,061 --> 00:10:20,904
Speaker 1: And it's like, you know, those are true.

158
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:23,709
Speaker 1: You shouldn't do those things because you'll mess yourself up, right?

159
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:29,300
Speaker 1: But when the AQI is bad, shouldn't they say don't drive, no cars right now?

160
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,100
Speaker 1: Well, so if... I mean, in this situation, cars are a drop in the bucket.

161
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:43,260
Speaker 0: Well, so they did because there is a line when it gets to the red and purple areas, which a lot of people learned about the purple and maroon colors that they've never seen before on those charts.

162
00:10:44,062 --> 00:10:51,600
Speaker 0: But when it's above 200, then yes, the advice actually is do not go anywhere under any circumstances.

163
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,084
Speaker 1: Right, but it's not about just going anywhere.

164
00:10:54,144 --> 00:11:00,560
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, they should... anything that burns anything, right, should just be like, all right, everyone stop burning things.

165
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:10,255
Speaker 0: In China and Singapore and even in other countries, yes, like in China, in many regions, when the AQI is above a certain point, there is a ban on barbecuing food.

166
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,580
Speaker 0: Like, there is a ban on certain people driving.

167
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:23,099
Speaker 1: Whereas in New York, the AQI was bad yesterday and we saw a fire on a roof that we don't know for sure, but I'm pretty sure a fire on a roof in a fancy building like that is likely a grill fire.

168
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:33,175
Speaker 0: I'm going to go to put it on record because I could be wrong, but based on the video and the photos I saw of that fire, I am very confident, like 80% confident.

169
00:11:33,435 --> 00:11:36,460
Speaker 0: that was a gas grill that caught fire and set all the things on fire.

170
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,215
Speaker 1: It's definitely the most likely explanation because it was a fancy building with a fire on the roof.

171
00:11:40,235 --> 00:11:41,138
Speaker 1: What else would burn up there?

172
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:54,015
Speaker 0: There was a bright yellow concentrated fire and a darker, like, orangish fire around it and there was a concentrated plume of white smoke and a separate, more diffuse plume of black smoke.

173
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:57,680
Speaker 0: That tells me gas fire was secondary adjacent wood fires.

174
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,652
Speaker 1: Maybe, but the point is, people were grilling.

175
00:12:04,773 --> 00:12:08,380
Speaker 1: Even if that person wasn't grilling, there was definitely grilling going on in New York yesterday.

176
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,144
Speaker 0: The AQI is above 200 in New York City.

177
00:12:10,444 --> 00:12:18,220
Speaker 0: There should be, just like during a Blizzard A, you will get a ticket if you're driving your car and you are not going to the hospital because there's an emergency.

178
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:41,409
Speaker 1: Yeah, like literally anything that has an exhaust should be temporarily banned in this situation because even though it's a minuscule improvement over, you know, considering- People are outside hurting themselves and I don't think people realize.

179
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,857
Speaker 0: I saw people, like, jogging outside.

180
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:44,760
Speaker 0: Like, what the fuck?

181
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,848
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, I think people, I don't know what people are thinking.

182
00:12:49,868 --> 00:12:51,030
Speaker 1: They just don't read news.

183
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,657
Speaker 1: The whole thing is, you can see this hell happening outside.

184
00:12:54,677 --> 00:12:56,100
Speaker 1: They just don't even recognize it.

185
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,980
Speaker 1: They look at their phone only and they don't smell anything.

186
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:09,420
Speaker 0: My guess, based on the people I have talked to today, I would guess that less than 10% of all adults in New York have ever heard of AQI before.

187
00:13:11,881 --> 00:13:15,875
Speaker 1: So, yeah, this is- But they don't notice, they look out the window and they say, "Oh, that's

188
00:13:15,915 --> 00:13:16,217
Speaker 1: normal.".

189
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:22,896
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, a friend was just talking about someone they knew who was just complaining about like, "Oh, the smog's really bad.

190
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,340
Speaker 0: Like, why doesn't the city do something about

191
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:24,440
Speaker 0: this?".

192
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,160
Speaker 0: They're like, "Buddy, that's-".

193
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,810
Speaker 1: "Buddy, did you see the mayor this morning?

194
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,299
Speaker 1: He's a shitty mayor, but like-".

195
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,744
Speaker 0: Like, even the shitty mayor.

196
00:13:30,784 --> 00:13:35,320
Speaker 0: Like, that fucked up, mostly broken clock is right three or four times a day.

197
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,857
Speaker 1: Yeah, that mayor was like, "Oh shit, emergency situation.

198
00:13:38,877 --> 00:13:39,078
Speaker 1: Let's

199
00:13:39,098 --> 00:13:39,219
Speaker 1: go.".

200
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:43,078
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's pro-bike lane and now he's like, "Yo, don't fucking go

201
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:43,380
Speaker 0: outside.".

202
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, he says he's pro-bike lane, but he hasn't delivered on his bike lane promises.

203
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:53,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, the bike lanes are progressing more than they were before, but- The point is, it's like, why doesn't the city do something about this?

204
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,800
Speaker 1: There was a huge emergency press conference this morning with a whole thing going on.

205
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,620
Speaker 0: The city's doing a lot, most of what it can, but the city could go further.

206
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,820
Speaker 0: We should say everyone should work from home like COVID times until this is resolved.

207
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,360
Speaker 1: We should sue Canada for damages.

208
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,843
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course.

209
00:14:09,304 --> 00:14:14,940
Speaker 0: Arguably, the fires in Canada are being caused by climate change, and you know who's causing climate change?

210
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,285
Speaker 0: You know who are the biggest offenders?

211
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:32,639
Speaker 0: Meat production, particularly beef, cars, and underdeveloped countries who arguably are using practices that are the best they have available because more developed countries will not share their technology and help them.

212
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,240
Speaker 1: Well, we can at least force the first two to pay for it.

213
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,968
Speaker 0: Yes, we should sue beef.

214
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,640
Speaker 0: Literally, it's not even just meat, it is beef.

215
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,180
Speaker 0: Beef causes a huge percentage of all of this.

216
00:14:43,481 --> 00:14:53,680
Speaker 0: If we just reduced human beef consumption by like 20%, that would materially impact climate change even more so than heavily restricting cars.

217
00:14:54,321 --> 00:14:56,250
Speaker 0: Like, the solut- This is the-.

218
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:13,859
Speaker 0: I guess we gotta move on to the rest of the show, and this is a Wednesday, but it always bothers me when it's not that the solutions are easy, but there are obvious, relatively straightforward, objectively achievable ways to mitigate problems at a wide scale, and we as a collective human society can't even do that.

219
00:15:16,102 --> 00:15:17,371
Speaker 0: Alright, and some animation news!

220
00:15:17,431 --> 00:15:18,499
Speaker 0: There's a ton going on.

221
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:27,220
Speaker 0: So, you know, Hayao Miyazaki's presumably last film, this is what- His last, last, last for real this time, guys.

222
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,196
Speaker 0: Final, final, final, one, two, three, dot, mv4.

223
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,560
Speaker 1: This thing is coming out next month.

224
00:15:32,901 --> 00:15:33,656
Speaker 1: July 14th in theaters.

225
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:41,360
Speaker 1: I thought he was gonna die and just keep improving it and polishing it until he died, and then it would just- ought to be released in whatever form it was in at the time.

226
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:42,699
Speaker 1: I didn't know when it was coming out!

227
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:48,600
Speaker 1: But I guess- no, I guess- I guess he's releasing it, and he's alive, despite chainsmoking his whole life.

228
00:15:49,221 --> 00:15:53,477
Speaker 0: So, uh, I noticed this news because it was like, "How do you live?

229
00:15:53,497 --> 00:15:53,999
Speaker 0: We'll not have a

230
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:54,340
Speaker 0: trailer.".

231
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,887
Speaker 0: And I was like, "Oh, that's interesting,".

232
00:15:55,927 --> 00:15:58,660
Speaker 0: and I skimmed this article, and read the article.

233
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,520
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna read the whole thing to you, you've just gotta read it.

234
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:09,140
Speaker 0: There's- This is densely packed with buried leaves and fascinating things, but basically, the article is about why there is no trailer.

235
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,580
Speaker 0: Uh, Ghibli, they are not going to release a trailer, or even a plot synopsis.

236
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,160
Speaker 0: The movie is just going to appear in theaters.

237
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,660
Speaker 1: It's based on a book that you can read, it's available in English.

238
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,300
Speaker 1: It may be a book club book one day, I don't know, right?

239
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,500
Speaker 1: But it's like, it's based on- you don't need to make a trailer for something when there's a book.

240
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,820
Speaker 1: Anyone can just read the book and be able to plot.

241
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:40,540
Speaker 0: Or even better, so the producer at Ghibli, Toshio Suzuki, gave an interview where he actually talked about this a lot, and he basically said they are- him and Miyazaki are done with full-blown marketing cycles.

242
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,560
Speaker 0: They don't have the energy for it anymore.

243
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,651
Speaker 0: Quote, "You get tired of doing the same thing over and over.

244
00:16:45,712 --> 00:16:46,937
Speaker 0: We wanted to try something new this

245
00:16:46,977 --> 00:16:47,198
Speaker 0: time.".

246
00:16:47,802 --> 00:16:50,080
Speaker 0: Uh, but he went further and said something I think is really important.

247
00:16:50,562 --> 00:16:57,517
Speaker 0: He remarked, and I'm quoting the article now, "If audiences are interested in watching something, they don't need to see trailers to be

248
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,019
Speaker 0: convinced.".

249
00:16:59,321 --> 00:16:59,803
Speaker 0: And, nope.

250
00:17:00,084 --> 00:17:11,338
Speaker 0: I respect that, I mean, like, Breath of the Wild 2, Tears of the Kingdom, all Nintendo had to say was, "Breath of the Wild 2 is coming, it's called Tears of the Kingdom, it'll be out on this

251
00:17:11,378 --> 00:17:11,539
Speaker 0: date.".

252
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,380
Speaker 0: They could have said nothing more, they would have sold the exact same number of copies.

253
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:19,819
Speaker 1: Well, hold on now, there's a little- alright, so I would have bought it, for sure, right?

254
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:30,220
Speaker 1: But, I had, like I said during the episode, I had suspicions, I was worried it might have just been sort of, like, not a huge difference between that and Breath of the Wild, right?

255
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:39,100
Speaker 1: But, so there are some people who might have been on the fence, and so they had to show a little bit of proof that, like, no, this is a big leap, it's a new deal.

256
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,400
Speaker 0: I see where you're going.

257
00:17:41,081 --> 00:17:42,440
Speaker 1: Some additional people on board.

258
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:53,700
Speaker 0: My counterargument is that a pro move would be to, you still have a marketing blitz and trailers and everything ready to go, but, you release those when you release the thing.

259
00:17:54,722 --> 00:17:58,120
Speaker 1: No, I think the pro move would just be, "Don't do the ads," right?

260
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,099
Speaker 1: Other than to say, "A new Zelda is coming on this day," right?

261
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:10,778
Speaker 1: And then, if there are hesitant people who aren't sure, they're not just gonna buy any Zelda sight unseen, the first wave would play it and be like, "Oh,

262
00:18:10,879 --> 00:18:11,080
Speaker 1: shit!".

263
00:18:11,181 --> 00:18:18,440
Speaker 1: And then that would be the free marketing, and then the second wave, and then in the end, you sell the same number of copies, just maybe a little slower.

264
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:30,619
Speaker 0: But a Miyazaki movie, I think, is a little bit different, because a Miyazaki movie is a particular situation where 100% of the universe of people who care about this know it's coming and will see it when they find out about it.

265
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, if you're already, you know, it's like, if no one's ever heard of you, right?

266
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,880
Speaker 1: Well, then, obviously, you need to do some kind of hustling, right?

267
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,180
Speaker 1: Even though we don't believe in ads and like ads, it's like, if you're trying capitalism...

268
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,560
Speaker 0: Now, that hustle could be press releases, interviews...

269
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,180
Speaker 1: But it's like, you gotta capitalism to some extent, right?

270
00:18:50,240 --> 00:19:03,840
Speaker 1: But if you're already Miyazaki, it's like, the marketing that you've already spent on all your previous movies, and all your previous movies already existing and already having been seen, are the advertising for the next one, right?

271
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:14,180
Speaker 1: It's like, that's the reason we don't need an ad for the new Zelda, it's because I've played other Zelda, so you don't need to advertise, you just need to say, "Hey, another one," right?

272
00:19:14,441 --> 00:19:23,860
Speaker 1: So, when you've seen 10 Miyazaki movies, 10 Ghibli movies, and it's like, "Hey, another one," that's all you gotta say, you don't need to do the big marketing thing, because it's already set.

273
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:24,715
Speaker 0: Yup.

274
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,400
Speaker 1: But if this is a new studio, a new director releasing the exact same movie, right?

275
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:32,660
Speaker 1: Then, you wouldn't be able to get away with that.

276
00:19:32,741 --> 00:19:34,519
Speaker 1: So, he basically... If you want a capitalism...

277
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,220
Speaker 0: And the best part is, what he said was, this also influenced him to choose a minimalistic approach.

278
00:19:38,481 --> 00:19:42,080
Speaker 0: There will be no film spots, no TV spots, no newspaper ads, nothing.

279
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,219
Speaker 0: Just this visual will do, and then there's a link to...

280
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,151
Speaker 1: Yeah, you need a poster.

281
00:19:47,212 --> 00:19:47,800
Speaker 1: You need a poster.

282
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,757
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that poster...

283
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,439
Speaker 1: You need a name.

284
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:59,259
Speaker 0: That poster of the bird-looking thing is the sole artifact that exists in public about this movie, other than the book itself, if you want to go look at it.

285
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, you need to have a movie poster, otherwise people go to the theater and they're like, "Which

286
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,020
Speaker 1: one?".

287
00:20:04,722 --> 00:20:11,439
Speaker 0: But the movie poster for me could have been Miyazaki made another movie, and it just depicted... You could have just put text, yes.

288
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:17,391
Speaker 1: And then, you're getting free advertising, because movie theaters are going to say, "Now playing, Hayao Miyazaki's..." Right?

289
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,377
Speaker 1: And movie reviewers are going to say, "I saw this movie, five stars, four

290
00:20:22,417 --> 00:20:22,899
Speaker 1: stars."

291
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,191
Speaker 1: Right?

292
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,297
Speaker 1: And then, people on the internet are going to be like,

293
00:20:26,357 --> 00:20:26,679
Speaker 1: "Hey!".

294
00:20:27,021 --> 00:20:28,860
Speaker 1: So, you're going to get free ads that way.

295
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,233
Speaker 1: You don't need to pay for other capitalists.

296
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,940
Speaker 1: You don't need to basically give free money to TV stations to get ads.

297
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,080
Speaker 1: You can just make more profits.

298
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:44,840
Speaker 0: Yep, in fact, basically, it's almost a gabbo, gabbo, gabbo situation, where you're sort of tricking everyone else into advertising your thing for you.

299
00:20:45,601 --> 00:20:46,559
Speaker 1: Well, they do that anyway.

300
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,639
Speaker 1: It's just, that's all the advertising you need, because you're already...

301
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:49,868
Speaker 0: Yep.

302
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:55,320
Speaker 0: So, in some other news, Image Comics is leaving Diamond Distributors.

303
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:02,280
Speaker 1: Right, so years and years ago, a long time ago, comic books were sold on the newsstand, right?

304
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,379
Speaker 1: Like, next to the newspapers and the magazines, and all the kids bought them.

305
00:21:05,941 --> 00:21:09,117
Speaker 1: And then, when comic books, you know, sort of fell by the wayside, right?

306
00:21:09,981 --> 00:21:11,620
Speaker 1: They got rescued, right?

307
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,980
Speaker 1: The only way they were able to survive was through direct distribution.

308
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:25,220
Speaker 1: Basically, we're going to sell them to comic book stores only, with this wholesale plan, and that way, the margins work out for everybody, and we can keep comic books going that way.

309
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:32,060
Speaker 1: And that's why comic book stores came into existence, and you didn't see so many comic books on the newsstand, right?

310
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:43,660
Speaker 1: And then, the manga times hit, and suddenly all the bookstores were selling all the mangas, and we complained on Geek Nights for about a decade, and every other comic book podcast has been complaining for several decades.

311
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,460
Speaker 1: Like, hey, you know, this direct market distribution thing is fucking everything up.

312
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,758
Speaker 1: It's not good anymore, right?

313
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:54,820
Speaker 1: Now it's a problem, especially since it's all through this one distributor, Diamond, right?

314
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:10,019
Speaker 1: They have this monopoly, they got a stranglehold in the comics industry, holding back, you know, changes and improvements to the way comic books on dead trees are sold to the people in the United States and in other parts of the world, and it's holding back the art form, and et cetera, et cetera.

315
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:16,520
Speaker 1: So, it was only, not, you know, somewhat recently, a year, you know, a year ago, right?

316
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:26,040
Speaker 1: So Marvel, DC, right, Dark Horse, the biggest publishers, finally ended their exclusive agreements with Diamond, right?

317
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:32,480
Speaker 1: And maybe, they retained some Diamond relationships, but mostly Left Shift, right?

318
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:36,899
Speaker 1: Marvel is now being distributed by Random House, IDW and Dark Horse are as well.

319
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:45,780
Speaker 1: DC went to this other distributor called Lunar, and now Image is also going to the Lunar one who distributes the DC comics.

320
00:22:47,080 --> 00:23:00,879
Speaker 1: And so, yeah, this open, you know, the fact that this is now basically all the big, like, manufacturers in the United States and other, right, are now not with Diamond exclusively anymore.

321
00:23:02,402 --> 00:23:09,720
Speaker 1: The only ones left at Diamond are like Boom, Dynamite, and like, you know, some other pretty small, the smaller end ones, right?

322
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,999
Speaker 1: Like, Medium at best.

323
00:23:12,021 --> 00:23:20,620
Speaker 1: And so, yeah, it's like the end of an era, and we're still seeing, like, what impact this is going to have on comicdom, right?

324
00:23:21,222 --> 00:23:23,257
Speaker 1: And I'm not really sure, right?

325
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:28,757
Speaker 1: It's like, I feel like this move to have a big impact had to happen a longer time ago.

326
00:23:30,761 --> 00:23:37,174
Speaker 0: Yeah, because, like, comic shops aren't what they used to be, like, the whole ecosystem has changed so much in the past 20 years that...

327
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:44,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, people are just reading, you know, people who want to read comics are going very digital, even more so these days.

328
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,360
Speaker 0: I mean, I was reading Chainsaw Man digital, I was reading that Keanu Reeves one digital.

329
00:23:49,421 --> 00:23:50,465
Speaker 1: Yep, it's like you got.

330
00:23:50,506 --> 00:23:53,318
Speaker 1: the Webtoon thing is really where it's at right now.

331
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,900
Speaker 1: You know, people can basically make webcomics and make money on Webtoon somehow, right?

332
00:23:59,281 --> 00:24:02,477
Speaker 0: With the big asterisk of "Does anything make money and will it

333
00:24:02,517 --> 00:24:02,778
Speaker 0: last?".

334
00:24:03,363 --> 00:24:04,580
Speaker 0: But that's just an asterisk.

335
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,800
Speaker 1: There are people who make good money on Webtoon.

336
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Webtoon itself can continue to exist and be profitable long term.

337
00:24:11,441 --> 00:24:13,099
Speaker 1: It's been doing great for quite a few years.

338
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:25,540
Speaker 1: But yeah, personally, I think what happened to me is that there was this long period of time when I was a kid, there were a lot of comics I wanted to read, but I didn't have a lot of money.

339
00:24:26,501 --> 00:24:30,660
Speaker 1: And then, you know, access to comics decreased, right?

340
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:41,839
Speaker 1: And then it wasn't until, like, around the time I finished college, I had a job, Geek Nights was beginning, I had money, I had access to comics again, comics were, like, booming at the time.

341
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:50,072
Speaker 1: And I was able to acquire and read many comics, and I caught up on all these old comics, right, that I hadn't read, you know, ever, because I wasn't in at the time.

342
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,980
Speaker 1: And then, it took me a long time, I was ordering, reliably, comics every month for years.

343
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,012
Speaker 1: You know, a decade or two, since, like, 2006, right?

344
00:25:04,101 --> 00:25:06,119
Speaker 1: Like, I put in orders for comics every single month.

345
00:25:06,681 --> 00:25:09,096
Speaker 1: And it wasn't until, like, last year or so where it was.

346
00:25:09,156 --> 00:25:13,600
Speaker 1: finally, like, you know, there's nothing on the order form that I want this month.

347
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,724
Speaker 1: Like, just nothing.

348
00:25:15,106 --> 00:25:17,600
Speaker 1: It's not worth ordering anything, you know?

349
00:25:18,481 --> 00:25:20,959
Speaker 1: There's none of these comics, even if I buy them, I'm not gonna read them.

350
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,919
Speaker 1: I don't got room, right?

351
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:34,400
Speaker 1: And nowadays, basically, I'm only buying comics that are made-- I still prefer to read a comic on a dead tree, just because the digital is not perfect, right?

352
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,640
Speaker 1: It's still, you know, text, yeah, of course, I'm gonna read digital no problem.

353
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:50,220
Speaker 0: But, like, now I've even-- I've got such a backlog of dead tree comics that I bought a long time ago, or got, like, full compilations of things that are just sitting there that I haven't had time to read anyway.

354
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,260
Speaker 0: I'm kinda gonna dig into my backlog.

355
00:25:52,941 --> 00:25:53,122
Speaker 1: Nope.

356
00:25:53,804 --> 00:25:57,960
Speaker 1: So, but yeah, so there are some cases, for example, comics I've read recently, right?

357
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:03,480
Speaker 1: There was the Mike Allred Silver Surfer that I've wanted to read for a long time.

358
00:26:04,001 --> 00:26:05,571
Speaker 1: And I was like, "You know what?

359
00:26:05,652 --> 00:26:06,699
Speaker 1: I'm finally gonna go and read

360
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:06,860
Speaker 1: that.".

361
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,564
Speaker 1: And it was terrific.

362
00:26:07,584 --> 00:26:10,099
Speaker 1: I'm sure maybe Rim will read it, we could do an episode on it.

363
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:15,980
Speaker 1: But it's available in this Omnibus edition, which is, like, costs a fortune, right?

364
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,284
Speaker 1: So I'm like, "You know what?

365
00:26:17,727 --> 00:26:19,957
Speaker 1: I wonder if I can get it cheaper, or illegally,

366
00:26:19,977 --> 00:26:20,440
Speaker 1: right?".

367
00:26:20,862 --> 00:26:25,080
Speaker 1: And if you buy the Kindle edition, it's, like, a third of the price.

368
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,711
Speaker 1: It's, like, 30 bucks instead of 100-something, right?

369
00:26:28,241 --> 00:26:35,320
Speaker 1: And I read it on my giant iPad, and there were some parts where it wasn't ideal, like big spreads and things like that, right?

370
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:39,320
Speaker 1: But for the most part, reading on the giant iPad was just fine.

371
00:26:39,903 --> 00:26:41,479
Speaker 1: And I saved a lot of money.

372
00:26:42,721 --> 00:26:49,420
Speaker 1: There's a comic, a manga I wanted to read for a long time called, uh, Oyasumi Punpun, Goodnight Punpun, right?

373
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:50,548
Speaker 1: I just never bought it.

374
00:26:50,689 --> 00:26:52,000
Speaker 1: It's, like, these eight big volumes.

375
00:26:52,842 --> 00:26:54,150
Speaker 1: And I was like, "You know what?

376
00:26:54,653 --> 00:26:55,599
Speaker 1: Does the library have

377
00:26:55,639 --> 00:26:55,679
Speaker 1: it?".

378
00:26:55,941 --> 00:26:58,140
Speaker 1: Sure enough, the library had most of it, right?

379
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,278
Speaker 1: And I'm just like, "Get it at the library, return

380
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:00,339
Speaker 1: it.".

381
00:27:00,681 --> 00:27:06,280
Speaker 1: It's, you know, I like it, I'm reading it, I just don't feel the need to own it, or pay money for it, right?

382
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,778
Speaker 1: So, library is great for that.

383
00:27:09,303 --> 00:27:12,000
Speaker 1: Um, and so, yeah, I've just been not ordering.

384
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:18,180
Speaker 1: There's still some months where I order some comics, and other months, I just, you know, and when I do order, it's, like, way less.

385
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,000
Speaker 1: I'm just not seeing things on the order form, right?

386
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,998
Speaker 1: That, like, I feel like I need to, you know, go get, and I'm not going to be able to read them any other way.

387
00:27:27,826 --> 00:27:32,260
Speaker 0: That was an era of, like, the fact that you had an order form and a cadence to it.

388
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:46,516
Speaker 0: that was not tied to your life, it was tied to the publication cycle, and we're back in the mode that all other media is of, "Huh, I should consume that piece of media, immediately purchase or acquire it via whatever means at the time, as opposed to a

389
00:27:46,556 --> 00:27:46,979
Speaker 0: schedule.".

390
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:53,420
Speaker 1: Because of Diamond, right, the ordering months in advance was the way to get these things for a significant discount.

391
00:27:53,604 --> 00:27:54,058
Speaker 0: That is true.

392
00:27:54,661 --> 00:27:56,880
Speaker 1: And I can still do that, even without Diamond, right?

393
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:03,220
Speaker 1: It's still, you know, your retailer is still, you know, has some kind of similar arrangements with whoever the distributors are, right?

394
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,040
Speaker 1: You're not buying from a distributor directly.

395
00:28:07,684 --> 00:28:18,860
Speaker 1: But, you know, it's still, it's like, well, there's other ways, you know, it's like the discount for by pre-ordering the giant omnibus early is not as good as the discount of just buying the digital one.

396
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,138
Speaker 1: So, or the discount of going to the library and getting it for zero dollars, or, right?

397
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,199
Speaker 0: Also, just not, like if I'm buying something, not having to take up the space because all my bookshelves are full.

398
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,280
Speaker 0: Any book I buy, book has to go away somewhere.

399
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm going to go through again, probably.

400
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,480
Speaker 1: And, you know, I got a pile of books.

401
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:40,140
Speaker 0: Oh, Emily, we carried over, like, hundreds of dollars worth of books to book off.

402
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,860
Speaker 0: Like, we got a pile of money from that.

403
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,544
Speaker 1: I got a pile.

404
00:28:42,605 --> 00:28:45,577
Speaker 1: that's the pile where I need to read it once, and then I can get rid of it.

405
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:50,293
Speaker 1: And I've got, and then I'm going to make, there's another pile where it's like, "Yeah, I'm never going to read this again.

406
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:50,555
Speaker 1: It can

407
00:28:50,575 --> 00:28:50,757
Speaker 1: go.".

408
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:51,211
Speaker 0: Yeah.

409
00:28:51,681 --> 00:28:54,180
Speaker 0: The only things I'm, I really-- I don't feel that strongly about it.

410
00:28:54,280 --> 00:29:00,619
Speaker 0: I only keep special, important books, historic books, things like Sanctuary that I'll never get a physical copy of again in my life.

411
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,203
Speaker 1: Yeah.

412
00:29:02,224 --> 00:29:08,184
Speaker 1: There has to be some, for me to keep the book, right, at least once I put through the effort to go through the shelf, right, it has to have.

413
00:29:08,666 --> 00:29:17,440
Speaker 1: either I'm going to read it again, it has some significance, it's very hard to obtain it in another format, something of that.

414
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,700
Speaker 1: There has to be some, you know, reason.

415
00:29:20,762 --> 00:29:30,820
Speaker 1: But, you know, I guess there is value, though, in just having, you know, some books around, even if you've never read them, or even if you never planned to read them, right?

416
00:29:35,271 --> 00:29:37,850
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day!

417
00:29:38,351 --> 00:29:51,246
Speaker 0: I bumped into this just kind of randomly, and it is, it's in the same genre as, like, the Juggernaut video, or Tjundecats, you know, that type of do-a-funny voice dub over-- Lift 10 Pokemon.

418
00:29:51,712 --> 00:29:55,450
Speaker 0: Yep, over at, like, an animated show, especially an old one.

419
00:29:55,730 --> 00:30:04,109
Speaker 0: This one's with the old My Little Pony, particularly the My Little Pony and Friends, I think there was a movie or 10 episodes, it's like, I don't know, I never watched it.

420
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:07,409
Speaker 1: I don't know, I don't know anything about old My Little Pony, other than that, it was a thing.

421
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:12,490
Speaker 0: Of that genre of entertainment, this is one of the better ones I've seen for a few reasons.

422
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:12,670
Speaker 0: I agree.

423
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:22,670
Speaker 0: It's only a minute and 22 seconds long, so it doesn't beat around the bush, like, Tjundecats is really funny, but you could edit that down to be, like, a third of its length, and it would be just as funny.

424
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:25,810
Speaker 0: Juggernaut, you really only need two scenes in Juggernaut.

425
00:30:27,432 --> 00:30:33,250
Speaker 0: Also, Juggernaut has a lot of unfortunate dialogue that is best forgotten, like, I wouldn't revisit it in a modern era.

426
00:30:33,931 --> 00:30:45,310
Speaker 0: But the end of Honeysuckle is concise, the voice acting's good and funny, and that is the plot of that season, as far as I can tell, like, it is that stupid.

427
00:30:45,694 --> 00:30:47,170
Speaker 0: So, I laughed out loud.

428
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:51,049
Speaker 0: This was actually legitimately funny, and I appreciate this, and I think everyone should watch it.

429
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,930
Speaker 0: It's worth a minute and 22 seconds of your time.

430
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:57,150
Speaker 1: Alright, well, my thing of the day is worth 15 minutes of your time.

431
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:01,330
Speaker 1: It's on the New York Times Cooking YouTube channel, right?

432
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:07,382
Speaker 1: And basically, they do this profile of a man whose only job is to be a bagel roller.

433
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,990
Speaker 1: He rolls the bagels by hand, right?

434
00:31:13,352 --> 00:31:16,370
Speaker 1: And not a machine-rolled bagel, a hand-rolled bagel, right?

435
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:19,910
Speaker 1: This man rolls thousands of bagels, right?

436
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:20,870
Speaker 1: Like, daily.

437
00:31:22,191 --> 00:31:31,170
Speaker 1: It only works, like, three to four days a week, and for several different bagel shops, he goes in and he rolls bagels, right?

438
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:34,510
Speaker 1: Like, that's such a tiny skill, right?

439
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:39,170
Speaker 1: Such a narrow expertise of, like, prepare dough, roll bagels, right?

440
00:31:39,632 --> 00:31:40,948
Speaker 1: And then that's all he does.

441
00:31:42,612 --> 00:31:47,870
Speaker 1: And it's pretty amazing to see, like, you know, this person's life story, how they ended up there, right?

442
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:55,280
Speaker 1: How they roll the bagels, you know, the work's really hard, but also, you know, a satisfying craft, right?

443
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:57,170
Speaker 1: All in of itself, right?

444
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:03,967
Speaker 1: And to, even though you're doing, I guess, what some people might consider, like, low menial labor, right, or whatever, right?

445
00:32:05,151 --> 00:32:10,510
Speaker 1: It's like, that person is, like, putting food in the mouths of thousands of, right?

446
00:32:10,952 --> 00:32:21,470
Speaker 0: Well, also just watching a person, a human being, exhibiting, even if it's a narrow skill, such mastery and expertise of that skill.

447
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:28,950
Speaker 1: And this person rolls a bagel in, like, two seconds, and that one bagel, like, you know, the machine mixes the dough, right?

448
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:38,789
Speaker 1: It's like, he rolls a bagel in two seconds, and that two seconds of his hand going back and forth is, like, bringing someone, like, a whole breakfast of joy, right?

449
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,733
Speaker 1: It's just like, bam!

450
00:32:39,774 --> 00:32:48,530
Speaker 1: It's like, if I could produce joy at that rate, like, if you look at the joy per work, right, it's like, imagine how much work someone has to do to make a movie.

451
00:32:49,091 --> 00:32:53,310
Speaker 1: And the movie brings great joy to many audiences for 90 minutes, right?

452
00:32:53,411 --> 00:32:54,727
Speaker 1: And millions of people see it.

453
00:32:55,211 --> 00:33:03,850
Speaker 1: But the work that went in to produce, right, the ratio there, right, is maybe not that big a ratio, right?

454
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:06,690
Speaker 1: Because it's, like, the amount of work to make the movie is immense.

455
00:33:07,132 --> 00:33:18,229
Speaker 1: Whereas, okay, the amount of joy of eating a bagel for 10 minutes might not equal the 90 minute best movie you've ever seen, but a person, all they had to do was move their hand back and forth really fast, right?

456
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:24,130
Speaker 0: Well, you know, we did that panel way back on, like, Take Your Turn and, like, time in games, but we had that point around.

457
00:33:24,853 --> 00:33:34,069
Speaker 0: a game that's pretty fun that takes a minute to play is by some measures objectively better than a game that's more fun but takes 30 minutes to play.

458
00:33:34,732 --> 00:33:43,710
Speaker 1: Right, so, like, the joy and, you know, the factory that is this person and the joy they produce via bagels is incredible.

459
00:33:44,793 --> 00:33:46,250
Speaker 1: And the top, if you read the top comment...

460
00:33:46,811 --> 00:33:48,180
Speaker 0: I was about to mention that.

461
00:33:48,261 --> 00:33:50,769
Speaker 0: I just clicked Read More and read that whole comment just now.

462
00:33:51,111 --> 00:33:56,790
Speaker 1: Right, so a lot of people are coming out like, "Oh, this guy, you know, his labor is being treated poorly.

463
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,924
Speaker 1: This guy's slaving away in the basement making

464
00:33:58,945 --> 00:33:59,348
Speaker 1: bagels.".

465
00:33:59,691 --> 00:34:03,809
Speaker 1: The top comment is from the guy who owns the bagel shop, who would be, I guess, the man.

466
00:34:04,312 --> 00:34:08,949
Speaker 1: And he's like, "Nope, I realize that basically I depend entirely on this dude.

467
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:14,105
Speaker 1: I pay him a lot of money and I'm good to his

468
00:34:14,165 --> 00:34:14,607
Speaker 1: family.".

469
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:15,989
Speaker 1: Et cetera, et cetera.

470
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:18,810
Speaker 1: But to be fair, he should just give the guy the bagel shop.

471
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,270
Speaker 1: because what are you doing, owner guy?

472
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:21,540
Speaker 1: What do you do?

473
00:34:22,024 --> 00:34:22,590
Speaker 1: Some paperwork?

474
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,739
Speaker 0: That's right into some communism.

475
00:34:26,002 --> 00:34:27,389
Speaker 0: What does capital provide?

476
00:34:28,531 --> 00:34:28,871
Speaker 1: Yeah.

477
00:34:29,414 --> 00:34:33,110
Speaker 1: Anyway, but yeah, don't worry, the bagel guy is doing alright.

478
00:34:33,674 --> 00:34:35,243
Speaker 1: They know his worth.

479
00:34:35,284 --> 00:34:36,250
Speaker 1: He knows his own worth.

480
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:41,370
Speaker 1: He could go, if you can hand roll, so few people have the skill at this level.

481
00:34:41,911 --> 00:34:57,669
Speaker 1: If you out there listening think that you can roll thousands of bagels in a day, several days a week, you could walk into New York City and name your salary at any number of bagel places because there are not that many people that can do that.

482
00:34:58,232 --> 00:35:08,030
Speaker 1: And when you roll a bagel in two seconds, they pay you six figures, but every time you roll a bagel, they're making several dollars.

483
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:14,950
Speaker 1: But your two seconds, it's like how much do you want to be paid for two seconds to go ba-bam with your hand, right?

484
00:35:15,491 --> 00:35:15,975
Speaker 1: A dollar?

485
00:35:16,601 --> 00:35:17,630
Speaker 1: Fine, I'll pay you a dollar.

486
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:20,850
Speaker 1: A thousand dollars, I'll pay you a dollar a bagel because I'm selling them for you.

487
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,870
Speaker 1: It's like no problem.

488
00:35:24,492 --> 00:35:29,487
Speaker 0: In the meta moment, the Geek Nights Book Club book is no longer the satanic versus, but it is now.

489
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:33,090
Speaker 0: The recommendation from one Bigelas Dickolas Wolfwood.

490
00:35:34,152 --> 00:35:36,630
Speaker 0: I shall never get over that account and that situation.

491
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:38,649
Speaker 0: This is how you lose the time war.

492
00:35:40,593 --> 00:35:41,766
Speaker 0: We don't have any cons coming up.

493
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,863
Speaker 0: Expect to see us at PAX West.

494
00:35:44,944 --> 00:35:45,629
Speaker 0: I booked hotels.

495
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,257
Speaker 1: We don't have cons coming up.

496
00:35:47,317 --> 00:35:49,209
Speaker 1: See us at PAX West, the con that's coming up.

497
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:52,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe I'm thinking about going to Kinetic Con.

498
00:35:52,754 --> 00:35:54,344
Speaker 0: I might actually go and do some panels.

499
00:35:54,364 --> 00:35:55,330
Speaker 0: I'm going to talk to them and see.

500
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,689
Speaker 0: That's an easy day trip.

501
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:59,830
Speaker 1: I could be convinced if it was very convenient.

502
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:01,078
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we'll see.

503
00:36:01,684 --> 00:36:02,390
Speaker 0: We'll see about Kinetic Con.

504
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,106
Speaker 1: If there's any kind of hassle, then I'd be like,

505
00:36:04,288 --> 00:36:04,449
Speaker 1: "Eh.".

506
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:08,110
Speaker 1: But if it's like, "Ah, very convenient to go to Kinetic Con.

507
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,827
Speaker 1: It's as convenient as it can be given the

508
00:36:09,847 --> 00:36:10,130
Speaker 1: circumstances."

509
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:12,224
Speaker 1: Then maybe I could do it.

510
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:21,150
Speaker 0: It would be weird to be at a Kinetic Con and not be literally responsible for a huge percentage of the entire convention's content and just be able to walk around and look around.

511
00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:26,330
Speaker 0: That would be a weird situation just because I've never really experienced that.

512
00:36:28,651 --> 00:36:31,209
Speaker 0: Also, PAX Unplugged is going to come up toward the end of this year.

513
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:34,606
Speaker 0: And MagFest looks like it's happening.

514
00:36:34,666 --> 00:36:35,370
Speaker 0: Dates were announced.

515
00:36:35,851 --> 00:36:38,384
Speaker 0: So if you're not going to book a hotel in...

516
00:36:39,792 --> 00:36:41,850
Speaker 1: The MagFest dates have been slightly adjusted.

517
00:36:42,232 --> 00:36:44,050
Speaker 1: It's like a week or two later than usual.

518
00:36:44,511 --> 00:36:49,690
Speaker 0: I got a hotel room because I do plan to go to this MagFest and do panels and get back to our old bullshit.

519
00:36:49,892 --> 00:36:51,990
Speaker 0: So stay tuned for those kinds of updates.

520
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,310
Speaker 1: Well, we'll see what happens.

521
00:36:54,511 --> 00:36:58,950
Speaker 1: I may or may not go, but we'll see what the circumstances are with how MagFest is doing things.

522
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,810
Speaker 1: We don't know if the mages are still there or what.

523
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:01,941
Speaker 0: Yeah, they were last year.

524
00:37:01,961 --> 00:37:02,590
Speaker 0: I was talking to them.

525
00:37:03,873 --> 00:37:07,530
Speaker 0: I sent my regrets that we weren't going to come because of the world situation.

526
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:11,529
Speaker 0: But I think I want to go to this MagFest and get that ball rolling again.

527
00:37:13,171 --> 00:37:14,802
Speaker 0: Let's dive right into Spider-Man.

528
00:37:16,131 --> 00:37:23,750
Speaker 0: Now, just because Spider-Man's Spider-Man, but we'll avoid spoilers for this movie until toward the end of the show.

529
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:24,750
Speaker 0: We'll tell you where the spoiler line is.

530
00:37:25,072 --> 00:37:33,590
Speaker 1: I don't believe in spoilers, but I do want to say, actually, the plot here, the spoiler-able plot, is like, it's solid.

531
00:37:34,633 --> 00:37:36,563
Speaker 1: It is solid Hollywood comic plot.

532
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:45,830
Speaker 0: The moment when you start to see where it's going, it's a bigger and more poignant and complex plot than I expected.

533
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:49,350
Speaker 0: And it also works on sort of an allegorical level about comics.

534
00:37:49,411 --> 00:37:50,709
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're going to talk about that.

535
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:59,630
Speaker 1: But the point is that the plot is, of all the reasons to see the Spider-Man movies, the two animated ones, the Spider-Verse ones, right?

536
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:01,409
Speaker 1: The plot is the last reason.

537
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:10,390
Speaker 0: Now, this is the best, I'm going to say straight up, this is, this movie, the best cinematic animation I have ever seen.

538
00:38:12,034 --> 00:38:13,888
Speaker 1: I mean, it's tough to say.

539
00:38:14,514 --> 00:38:16,169
Speaker 0: I say that only because I struggle.

540
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:19,110
Speaker 1: Only because the Akira people did not have the luxury.

541
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:38,330
Speaker 0: Oh, oh, oh, yeah, so I am, if I ignore efforts, technology, if you ignore how a movie came to be and just look at what hit my eyes, I struggle earnestly to name anything I have seen that stunned me visually to this degree.

542
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:42,826
Speaker 1: I think, you know, I don't know if this is too big to say, it might be going too far, right?

543
00:38:43,472 --> 00:39:05,989
Speaker 1: But it's not an extreme hyperbole to say that this is a, some sort of revolution in the medium of animation, akin to like when people learned how to paint in perspective or when video games were suddenly not, you know, like 3D, like Mario 64, it's like, or I guess, Mario 64 wasn't actually the first 3D game, but I guess like Quake, right?

544
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:17,609
Speaker 0: It might be more analogous to when first-person shooters went from everything is brown and gray to everything is ultra-realistic to things can have colors and games can be weird.

545
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:22,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's like, it's that sort of like big leap, right?

546
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:27,609
Speaker 1: The same way that like there was a big leap, you know, in open-world games with Breath of the Wild, right?

547
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:27,951
Speaker 1: -Yeah.

548
00:39:27,971 --> 00:39:35,086
Speaker 1: -This is a big leap over, you know, in a way you could say like, you know, it's similar to Breath of the Wild, right?

549
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:36,297
Speaker 1: -Yeah.

550
00:39:36,317 --> 00:39:37,690
Speaker 1: -There's two of them, right?

551
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:39,107
Speaker 1: There was Breath of the Wild and then...

552
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:41,590
Speaker 0: And the first one was the best Zelda game to ever be made.

553
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,050
Speaker 0: I'm just going to say it because I think it was.

554
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:51,410
Speaker 1: Right, the first one comes out and is like, you know, sort of shows the potential of the revolution and, you know, sets the stage.

555
00:39:51,832 --> 00:39:54,770
Speaker 1: And then the second one trampolines off the first one, right?

556
00:39:55,191 --> 00:40:07,529
Speaker 1: Spider-Man, the first one comes out, sets the stage, shows what can be possible, and the second one jumps off the trampoline with the first one and is like, that was the set, that was the appetizer, and now I'm the entree.

557
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:18,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, Spider-Man 2 is materially better animated than Spider-Man 1, and I say that already agreeing that Spider-Man 1 is already one of the better animated things ever made.

558
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:23,949
Speaker 1: So this movie starts out, right, in the Guggenheim Museum, right?

559
00:40:25,471 --> 00:40:31,310
Speaker 1: And in the Guggenheim Museum, right, on display are the works of many artists, right?

560
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:33,990
Speaker 1: I like when the Jeff Koons dog breaks and all the dogs come out.

561
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,020
Speaker 0: And then that one guy was like,

562
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:35,262
Speaker 0: "Whoa!".

563
00:40:36,332 --> 00:40:42,210
Speaker 1: And they're fighting a vulture who's from, like, the Da Vinci universe, who's made out of Da Vinci paper.

564
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:44,450
Speaker 1: It looks like, you know, what's the thing called?

565
00:40:44,872 --> 00:40:47,950
Speaker 1: You know, what's the name of the Da Vinci thing with the dude with his arms stretched out?

566
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:49,728
Speaker 1: I don't know what the name of it is.

567
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:50,677
Speaker 0: The guy, the David guy.

568
00:40:52,752 --> 00:40:54,350
Speaker 1: No, David's Michelangelo statue.

569
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,189
Speaker 0: Yeah, but what's the name of that guy?

570
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:56,870
Speaker 0: Da Vinci man.

571
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:58,845
Speaker 1: I don't know what the name of the Da Vinci thing is with the guy.

572
00:40:59,472 --> 00:40:59,969
Speaker 0: Vitruvian Man.

573
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:04,283
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, so it looks like it's the Vitruvian Vulture, basically, right?

574
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:06,009
Speaker 1: Who's in the Guggenheims.

575
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:20,410
Speaker 1: You have a dude based on one artistic style, right, from the Da Vinci universe, causing a ruckus in a museum, right, messing up all the art of all these different artists, right, and complaining about these other artists.

576
00:41:21,752 --> 00:41:25,549
Speaker 0: And you've got a full-on Spider-Man dialogue going the whole time.

577
00:41:25,991 --> 00:41:29,696
Speaker 1: But all of this different art is being drawn by one set of artists.

578
00:41:30,158 --> 00:41:31,323
Speaker 1: who are the artists?

579
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:32,890
Speaker 1: animating it, right?

580
00:41:33,233 --> 00:41:34,850
Speaker 1: Doing all these different styles, right?

581
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:48,770
Speaker 1: And you go from that to, instead, a multiverse of Spider-Men, where each universe is some sort of different art style, right, all coming together.

582
00:41:48,930 --> 00:42:05,967
Speaker 0: So Spider-Man 1 had a revolution with that animation style and the chromatic aberration, like the way they did it, it was itself revolutionary, but then they also had-- No, the chromatic aberration effect that they used heavily in that movie instead of some 3D effects.

583
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:07,869
Speaker 1: Not really.

584
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:10,609
Speaker 1: I don't know if that's the correct thing to call it.

585
00:42:11,052 --> 00:42:12,170
Speaker 0: I think that's what I would call that.

586
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:13,429
Speaker 0: That's what I've seen other people call it.

587
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:19,910
Speaker 0: There are other effects that are also at play, like the 2D effects that happen around the 3D characters.

588
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:20,746
Speaker 0: There's a lot going on.

589
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:32,450
Speaker 0: But then you had a handful of Spider-Men from other universes that had different artistic styles, and in the first Spider-Man movie, those characters were animated in different styles.

590
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:38,670
Speaker 0: Spider-Verse 2, like, took that to the absolute absurd extreme.

591
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:49,430
Speaker 0: You've got thousands of different Spider-Men all in their own styles, and you go across a bunch of different Spider-verses where the background and the setting itself is also in a different style.

592
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:55,890
Speaker 0: Like Spider-Gwen's Spider-Verse look is a completely different style from Morales's Spider-Verse.

593
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:56,930
Speaker 1: Yep.

594
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:03,530
Speaker 1: So you have that as like your stage setting, right?

595
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:13,526
Speaker 1: And then you basically get into this commentary, right, where it's like, look, people have been making -- telling the story of Spider-Man since the '60s, right?

596
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:15,349
Speaker 1: Spider-Man isn't actually that old.

597
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:15,770
Speaker 1: Yep.

598
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:18,349
Speaker 1: Spider-Man's only like 20 years older than we are, right?

599
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,330
Speaker 1: He's not that old.

600
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:28,430
Speaker 1: But if you look at, say, other intellectual properties, right, like a Star Wars or Lord of the Rings or a Star Trek, right?

601
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:32,409
Speaker 1: I guess Star Trek is kind of actually up there in terms of number of Star Trek stories told.

602
00:43:32,832 --> 00:43:35,630
Speaker 0: It is now only recently because of a Star Trek explosion.

603
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:36,670
Speaker 1: Right, right.

604
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:47,449
Speaker 1: But it's like because Spider-Man was a comic and there were Spider-Men TV shows, movies, it's like in that time, the number of people involved, right, because it wasn't always just like one person doing it.

605
00:43:47,630 --> 00:44:06,370
Speaker 1: It's like as an artistic collective, right, of all of society around the world, right, mostly in North America but in the English-speaking world, but also in other parts of the world, right, we humans of today have a lot of fucking practice drawing Spider-Man.

606
00:44:07,012 --> 00:44:07,190
Speaker 1: Right?

607
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:09,910
Speaker 1: It's like we are really fucking good at Spider-Man.

608
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:11,249
Speaker 1: We practiced that shit for so long.

609
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:16,270
Speaker 0: Spider-Man is one of the most recognizable characters in the history of the observed universe.

610
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:20,990
Speaker 1: He's not up there with the Mario and Mickey Mouse, but he's way up there, way up there.

611
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:25,290
Speaker 0: If you go wherever you live, go out in the street and ask a random person if they know who Spider-Man is.

612
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:26,989
Speaker 0: They will almost definitely know.

613
00:44:27,811 --> 00:44:30,229
Speaker 1: Depends, depends, but it's likely, right?

614
00:44:31,652 --> 00:44:55,010
Speaker 1: And so with all that practice at making Spider-Man, right, it's like normally you look at like other intellectual properties that have lots of adaptations and retellings and remixes and sequels and prequels, right, and what ends up happening is they, yeah, they come out with a different style, a different take, a different, you know, look at Batman movies, right?

615
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:58,849
Speaker 1: Each one is like a different take, a different style, another one, right?

616
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:02,350
Speaker 1: But there's still just another one, right?

617
00:45:02,931 --> 00:45:05,630
Speaker 1: It's like they might do a better job of it, right?

618
00:45:05,991 --> 00:45:09,710
Speaker 1: But they're doing a better job of doing the same thing.

619
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:09,927
Speaker 1: Yep.

620
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:13,850
Speaker 0: Like I did not need to see another Batman origin story.

621
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:14,689
Speaker 0: I don't give a shit.

622
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:18,410
Speaker 1: It's not even just the story being the same, right?

623
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:27,250
Speaker 1: It's just even if you do the origin story again, right, or whether you don't, it's still just another Batman movie, right?

624
00:45:27,752 --> 00:45:31,150
Speaker 1: Even if you do a great job of it, it's still another Batman movie.

625
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:40,030
Speaker 1: And what they've done here in Spider-Verse, right, is they say, look, we're not just going to make another Spider-Man, right?

626
00:45:40,712 --> 00:45:42,690
Speaker 1: And they get into a meta commentary.

627
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:46,890
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, this movie is about Spider-Man, the concept.

628
00:45:47,919 --> 00:45:48,130
Speaker 1: Right.

629
00:45:48,491 --> 00:45:55,670
Speaker 1: It's like they get into a meta commentary about like, look, you know, in every Spider-Man universe, there are certain things that happen, right?

630
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:56,710
Speaker 1: It's not spoilers, right?

631
00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:02,210
Speaker 1: There's an Uncle Ben that dies, or there's a-- With great power comes great responsibility.

632
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:06,009
Speaker 0: Spider-Man tries to save everybody, and maybe he can't.

633
00:46:07,113 --> 00:46:09,310
Speaker 1: There's a Gwen Stacy type of character.

634
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:10,810
Speaker 1: There's a married-- right?

635
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:20,789
Speaker 1: There's certain-- even whenever anyone does a Spider-Man, you can go read all the different renditions of Spider-Man, and they have these common threads between them.

636
00:46:22,612 --> 00:46:22,720
Speaker 1: Right?

637
00:46:23,753 --> 00:46:25,309
Speaker 0: And those-- You realize what you did there, right?

638
00:46:25,871 --> 00:46:26,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course.

639
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:36,730
Speaker 1: And those common threads, right, between all the different Spider-Man stories mean that all of them are still just another Spider-Man story.

640
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:39,110
Speaker 0: But they're also connected in this fundamental way.

641
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:39,938
Speaker 1: You're playing-- right.

642
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:45,470
Speaker 1: It's another person playing the same song in their own way.

643
00:46:45,631 --> 00:46:56,389
Speaker 1: And in here, right, what they've done in Spider-Verse is they say, look, right, we're going to go meta and recognize that, first of all, right, which is with the meta trend these days.

644
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:58,990
Speaker 0: I mean, I think the ultimate villain is canon as a concept.

645
00:46:59,932 --> 00:47:09,287
Speaker 1: And then, not only that, right, but we are going to simultaneously produce a work, right, that is still a Spider-Man story, right?

646
00:47:10,331 --> 00:47:14,090
Speaker 1: You can't say it's not, but is also not, right?

647
00:47:14,573 --> 00:47:17,310
Speaker 1: It is not just another Spider-Man story.

648
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:22,250
Speaker 0: Partly because it is also every Spider-Man story, but it's also the er Spider-Man story.

649
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:24,250
Speaker 0: But it's also this artistic thing.

650
00:47:25,953 --> 00:47:29,750
Speaker 1: We have practiced at doing Spider-Man so much, right?

651
00:47:30,151 --> 00:47:36,310
Speaker 1: We have now found a way to take it to another level and to another place, right?

652
00:47:36,691 --> 00:47:39,810
Speaker 1: And this is what I think the other intellectual properties are lacking.

653
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:46,909
Speaker 0: Star Wars, I think, is the chief-- Just make another one being the wrong way to go.

654
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:52,710
Speaker 1: Star Wars, they haven't practiced making as many Star Wars' as they have Spider-Man's, right?

655
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:59,150
Speaker 1: Even though there's been plenty of books and comics and video games and things like that, it's like there's a lot more practice.

656
00:47:59,691 --> 00:48:07,030
Speaker 1: Spider-Man's a bit older too, but there's been a lot more Spider-Man practice going on by artistic creators in the world.

657
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:17,080
Speaker 1: And so they have found a way to take Spider-Man and evolve to a new form and not just make another one, right?

658
00:48:17,931 --> 00:48:22,410
Speaker 1: And so I think that's really special and all the other intellectual properties gotta take note, right?

659
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:34,250
Speaker 1: It's like, what if we saw the Spider-Verse of Star Wars or the Spider-Verse of Lord of the Rings or, I don't know, other intellectual properties out there that are super popular.

660
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:35,269
Speaker 0: I mean, there aren't that many of them.

661
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:36,206
Speaker 1: Ninja Turtles, right?

662
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:37,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, Indiana Jones, even.

663
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:42,630
Speaker 1: There aren't that many of them, but-- Right, it's like, you know, no one's taking Indiana Jones to a new level.

664
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:45,727
Speaker 0: Indiana Jones, they're literally just making more Indiana Joneses.

665
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:52,430
Speaker 1: Right, it's like you're doing, you know, renditions and remixes and whatnot are one thing.

666
00:48:52,830 --> 00:49:01,769
Speaker 0: But I think that is what makes this movie special to the point that we're breaking one of our cardinal rules of praising something to too high of a degree too soon after we saw it.

667
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:06,207
Speaker 0: Usually we're like, "Oh, this anime might be S-tier, but we gotta wait a couple decades to make

668
00:49:06,267 --> 00:49:06,449
Speaker 0: sure.".

669
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:07,769
Speaker 1: No, I can tell you right now.

670
00:49:07,951 --> 00:49:20,969
Speaker 0: And I think it's the confluence of the revolutionary artistic process and style coupled with the, like, new way of telling a Spider-Man story that you described are both in the same trilogy at the same time.

671
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:31,541
Speaker 0: And I think that opening scene in the Guggenheim and, like, that moment is a flex on the level of when Cowboy Bebop had the balls to say, "Yeah, we made a new genre right now.

672
00:49:31,823 --> 00:49:32,024
Speaker 0: Fuck

673
00:49:32,064 --> 00:49:32,145
Speaker 0: you.".

674
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:34,308
Speaker 1: Pretty much.

675
00:49:35,712 --> 00:49:38,030
Speaker 0: Like, I have no notes about this movie.

676
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:38,834
Speaker 0: And it's long.

677
00:49:38,955 --> 00:49:42,608
Speaker 0: Like, it is over two hours long, which I did not know going into it.

678
00:49:43,251 --> 00:49:45,149
Speaker 1: And it just walked over.

679
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:46,099
Speaker 1: I knew it was gonna be that long.

680
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:47,010
Speaker 1: I didn't think it would be that long.

681
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:50,230
Speaker 1: I thought it was-- I could sort of tell it was gonna be to be continued.

682
00:49:50,732 --> 00:49:51,850
Speaker 1: Spoiler, whatever, right?

683
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:57,148
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, because I'm like, "There's no way they can resolve all this given it's already been an

684
00:49:57,188 --> 00:49:57,269
Speaker 1: hour.".

685
00:49:57,390 --> 00:50:19,870
Speaker 0: Well, considering that it is 140 minutes of raising the stakes and raising questions, the thing this movie does, unlike Spider-Man 1, which had a lot more downtime and slow beats, which were sort of setting up the characters, this one almost does the same thing at Punch Drunk Love or the second half of Escaflowne do, where it just accelerates and accelerates and accelerates.

686
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:25,410
Speaker 0: And every moment, it's just throwing more at you and adding more complication and expanding what it's about.

687
00:50:25,752 --> 00:50:28,630
Speaker 0: And then at this breakneck speed, it hits a brick wall to be continued credits.

688
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:30,137
Speaker 1: Yep.

689
00:50:31,652 --> 00:50:34,510
Speaker 1: So, yeah, but, yeah, I thought the to be continued was gonna come.

690
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:36,930
Speaker 1: I was getting that feeling that it was gonna come.

691
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:39,349
Speaker 0: I thought it was gonna come about a half hour before it did.

692
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:41,750
Speaker 1: It came way later than I thought it was gonna come.

693
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:50,330
Speaker 1: So, like, I was right that-- I guessed correctly that there's no way it was gonna finish in the one movie once it had been on long enough, but I guessed wrong.

694
00:50:50,951 --> 00:50:52,344
Speaker 1: I was like, "Whoa, two hours,

695
00:50:52,425 --> 00:50:52,667
Speaker 1: right?".

696
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:55,588
Speaker 1: It's like, "What other animations are that

697
00:50:55,608 --> 00:50:55,689
Speaker 1: long?".

698
00:50:55,951 --> 00:50:56,647
Speaker 1: Well, we looked it up.

699
00:50:57,070 --> 00:50:57,925
Speaker 1: This is the longest?

700
00:50:58,610 --> 00:50:59,790
Speaker 1: It's longer than Fantasia.

701
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:07,990
Speaker 0: This is the longest animated feature ever made by an American studio, and it's one of the longest animated films of all time.

702
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:12,401
Speaker 0: It is beaten by a Hungarian animated film that took, like, 30 years to make.

703
00:51:12,441 --> 00:51:13,550
Speaker 0: that we just learned about.

704
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:14,770
Speaker 1: Yep.

705
00:51:15,911 --> 00:51:22,369
Speaker 1: And there's an anime movie in this corner of the world that I guess maybe we should watch.

706
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:31,780
Speaker 1: The original version of that movie was only 129 minutes, but there was in 2019 an extended edition released that's 168 minutes, and so that beats Spider-Verse.

707
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:34,869
Speaker 1: So, Spider-Verse is in third place.

708
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:43,290
Speaker 0: Now, I suspect-- Now, I haven't seen that other movie, but if I had to guess, that movie per minute is not as good or entertaining as Spider-Man.

709
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:44,882
Speaker 1: No, there is no-- Right?

710
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:49,270
Speaker 1: It's like, this Spider-Man movie, for its incredible length, right?

711
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:57,804
Speaker 0: You are-- It's like, normally-- Like, this was a better value than when we saw the Powerpuff Girls movie for 25 cents in the theater.

712
00:51:58,530 --> 00:51:59,359
Speaker 1: I thought it was 50 cents.

713
00:51:59,359 --> 00:51:59,905
Speaker 0: 50 cents?

714
00:52:00,027 --> 00:52:00,310
Speaker 0: I forget.

715
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:03,717
Speaker 0: Like, it wasn't-- I think we each spent 25 cents, so we said 50 cents.

716
00:52:03,737 --> 00:52:04,810
Speaker 1: I thought it was 50 cents each.

717
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:05,299
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

718
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:05,830
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

719
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:07,088
Speaker 0: That was, like, 20 years ago.

720
00:52:08,572 --> 00:52:20,150
Speaker 1: The point is, is, like, it's, like, I think I forget what I was talking about when I said this, but I was like, "Oh, it's, like, a delicious meal, but there's so much of it, and then you get full, and you don't want anymore," right?

721
00:52:20,231 --> 00:52:20,983
Speaker 1: It's just, like, 10 steaks, right?

722
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:24,390
Speaker 0: If this had been four hours long and just kept going, I wouldn't have even been.

723
00:52:25,294 --> 00:52:31,130
Speaker 1: This is, like, a 50-course meal, and somehow every course is delicious, and you have room for more.

724
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:33,350
Speaker 0: You're, like, reaching for the dessert menu again.

725
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:33,794
Speaker 1: Never full.

726
00:52:33,978 --> 00:52:34,589
Speaker 1: Never full.

727
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:45,309
Speaker 1: It's, like, every-- I just bring a different meal, and you eat that different meal, and it's the most delicious one, and somehow I'm still hungry, and they bring another one, and I want another one after that somehow.

728
00:52:45,711 --> 00:52:52,929
Speaker 0: Finally, you're like Homer in the seafood restaurant, and you try to get more food, and then suddenly the waiter's like, "Sorry, we're closed," and they just kick you out.

729
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:54,850
Speaker 0: There isn't even a stinger after the credits.

730
00:52:55,130 --> 00:53:01,930
Speaker 0: It just ends on a "to be continued," and it is 0.25 Escaflones' worth of a cliffhanger.

731
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:04,430
Speaker 1: Maybe I should just go to the theater and see it again.

732
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:05,590
Speaker 0: I would watch it again in the theater.

733
00:53:07,158 --> 00:53:08,510
Speaker 1: I can just go over there whenever the hell I want.

734
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:10,650
Speaker 0: I went and saw the first Spider-Verse in the theater twice.

735
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:11,689
Speaker 0: That's how good it was.

736
00:53:12,431 --> 00:53:13,424
Speaker 1: I can just go over and watch it again.

737
00:53:13,465 --> 00:53:13,850
Speaker 1: No one can stop me.

738
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:16,350
Speaker 0: Hell, if the first Spider-Verse is in the theater again, I'd watch that there again.

739
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:27,649
Speaker 0: This movie is already on my very short list of movies like Star Wars or The Matrix, where if I see even a few seconds of it and nothing's stopping me, I might just watch it to the end.

740
00:53:28,353 --> 00:53:30,270
Speaker 0: If you put it on a screen, it's like a basilisk.

741
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:30,889
Speaker 0: It'll trap you.

742
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:33,230
Speaker 1: And there's another one that's coming, right?

743
00:53:33,412 --> 00:53:34,448
Speaker 1: We're gonna get another one.

744
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:36,299
Speaker 0: If that other one's also 140-plus minutes, like...

745
00:53:39,581 --> 00:53:39,769
Speaker 1: Yeah.

746
00:53:40,492 --> 00:53:41,950
Speaker 1: It's gonna come March next year.

747
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:42,546
Speaker 1: It's weird.

748
00:53:43,454 --> 00:53:51,790
Speaker 0: It is weird for you and I on Geek Nights because we have a reputation for being kind of old, cynical nerd guys to be so hype about this movie.

749
00:53:52,192 --> 00:53:53,290
Speaker 0: And I'm still riding high.

750
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:57,407
Speaker 1: Normally, I'm like the anti-fan of all the live-action superhero movies.

751
00:54:00,097 --> 00:54:04,449
Speaker 0: I am picky about what I watch, and Scott is like an order of magnitude pickier than me.

752
00:54:04,914 --> 00:54:11,290
Speaker 0: And the fact that both of us, this movie is 11 out of 10, things change because of this movie.

753
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:23,230
Speaker 0: This movie, I think, I'm gonna say right now, I think this movie, this trilogy, is going to impact a future generation of creators the way that Star Wars impacted a global generation of creators.

754
00:54:25,573 --> 00:54:31,970
Speaker 1: This is now... Is this... I think there's been so many Spider-Man.

755
00:54:32,331 --> 00:54:34,788
Speaker 1: Is this the best Spider-Man of all Spider-Mans?

756
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:36,890
Speaker 0: Yes, because it is all Spider-Mans.

757
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:38,748
Speaker 0: It's about all Spider-Mans.

758
00:54:39,932 --> 00:54:48,649
Speaker 1: It's like if you're going to... If you have to pick one Spider-Man thing, a comic or a book or a... I've read a Spider-Man book with text, by the way.

759
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:50,590
Speaker 1: They exist.

760
00:54:51,754 --> 00:54:53,449
Speaker 1: Or a movie or a TV show.

761
00:54:54,413 --> 00:54:56,389
Speaker 1: And you gotta pick one to rule them all.

762
00:54:56,913 --> 00:54:57,549
Speaker 1: This is the one.

763
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:02,050
Speaker 1: This is like... This is the best Spider-Man thing that has been made.

764
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:03,790
Speaker 1: Better than any Stan Lee Spider-Man.

765
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:05,769
Speaker 1: Not that the other ones aren't good.

766
00:55:07,316 --> 00:55:08,070
Speaker 0: It's a step above.

767
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:16,910
Speaker 0: But the fact that it might be the best one and it's about Spider-Man as a concept is a confluence that is exceptional.

768
00:55:18,818 --> 00:55:23,489
Speaker 1: I mean, just think about something like, you know, Van Gogh doing sunflowers.

769
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:24,371
Speaker 1: Right?

770
00:55:24,736 --> 00:55:26,779
Speaker 1: And it's like, Van Gogh does more sunflowers.

771
00:55:26,981 --> 00:55:27,930
Speaker 1: He gets better at sunflowers.

772
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:28,732
Speaker 1: Right?

773
00:55:28,936 --> 00:55:32,761
Speaker 1: How many people after Van Gogh have like, you know, done some sunflowers?

774
00:55:32,963 --> 00:55:33,550
Speaker 1: Right?

775
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:39,350
Speaker 1: It's like people have been painting sunflowers for a long time, copying Van Gogh's style, doing it in their own style.

776
00:55:39,876 --> 00:55:40,098
Speaker 1: Right?

777
00:55:40,341 --> 00:55:44,727
Speaker 1: But it's like, even after... How long has Van Gogh, like 1800 or something?

778
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:46,117
Speaker 1: Really long time ago.

779
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,590
Speaker 1: Longer ago than Spider-Man.

780
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:48,287
Speaker 1: Right?

781
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:52,969
Speaker 1: Has anyone revolutionized and taken the sunflower painting to a new level?

782
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:53,812
Speaker 1: Right?

783
00:55:54,523 --> 00:55:54,990
Speaker 1: You know, maybe.

784
00:55:55,692 --> 00:55:57,290
Speaker 1: I'm not paying attention to the painting world.

785
00:55:57,310 --> 00:55:58,470
Speaker 0: I could be missing out.

786
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:00,770
Speaker 0: What's the best sunflower work of art that was ever made?

787
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:02,110
Speaker 0: Let us know in the comments.

788
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:04,749
Speaker 1: I could be missing out on some sunflower out there.

789
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:05,494
Speaker 1: Right?

790
00:56:05,837 --> 00:56:08,510
Speaker 1: You know, I've seen the Van Gogh, not all of them, right?

791
00:56:09,439 --> 00:56:10,209
Speaker 1: But, you know.

792
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:24,384
Speaker 1: But here, it's like, it's as if... Imagine if I come out with a sunflower painting and you can look at it next to the Van Gogh and it's like, you know, looking at a Mario 64 next to a Mario 1.

793
00:56:24,384 --> 00:56:25,910
Speaker 1: It's like that dramatic difference.

794
00:56:27,014 --> 00:56:27,761
Speaker 1: And that's the difference.

795
00:56:27,782 --> 00:56:34,535
Speaker 1: You put Spider-Verse next to any previous Spider-Man and it's like looking at Mario 1 next to Mario 64.

796
00:56:34,535 --> 00:56:35,529
Speaker 1: The difference between them.

797
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:46,909
Speaker 1: And it's like to achieve that in a time when people have already had access to all computer animation techniques and such for a long time already, right?

798
00:56:47,351 --> 00:56:48,228
Speaker 1: To achieve it now.

799
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:49,999
Speaker 1: Right?

800
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,290
Speaker 1: It's like, that's something else.

801
00:56:51,793 --> 00:56:51,975
Speaker 1: Right?

802
00:56:52,056 --> 00:56:57,490
Speaker 1: Rather than you would expect it at a point like with Mario 64 where it's like, "Ah, we have a new technology available.

803
00:56:57,611 --> 00:56:59,812
Speaker 1: That's why we were able to go to this new

804
00:56:59,852 --> 00:57:00,236
Speaker 1: level.".

805
00:57:00,478 --> 00:57:03,610
Speaker 1: But there isn't any particular new technology now.

806
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:06,561
Speaker 0: There are some tools, some techniques, some processing power.

807
00:57:06,783 --> 00:57:07,147
Speaker 1: There are things

808
00:57:07,653 --> 00:57:23,488
Speaker 0: that facilitated this, but other studios have access to those tools and what's different here is that they decided to push those tools to their limits while also it's almost like they sat down as they were putting this together and continuously everyone was always thinking, "How could we push this

809
00:57:23,548 --> 00:57:23,730
Speaker 0: further?"

810
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:25,409
Speaker 0: at every step of the way.

811
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:26,292
Speaker 1: Right.

812
00:57:26,312 --> 00:57:37,747
Speaker 1: But with Toy Story, you can point at it and be like, you know, "Yes, Toy Story was a big dramatic improvement achievement, et cetera, but there was a thing happening in the world that allowed that to

813
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:37,989
Speaker 1: happen."

814
00:57:38,831 --> 00:57:39,034
Speaker 1: Right?

815
00:57:39,054 --> 00:57:42,437
Speaker 1: And it's sort of like Spider-Verse doesn't have some excuse.

816
00:57:42,762 --> 00:57:42,944
Speaker 1: Right?

817
00:57:42,984 --> 00:57:43,349
Speaker 1: Like that.

818
00:57:44,110 --> 00:57:47,202
Speaker 1: There's less credit to the computer people.

819
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:48,070
Speaker 1: Not that there's none.

820
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:48,853
Speaker 1: Right?

821
00:57:49,178 --> 00:57:53,304
Speaker 1: And more credit on the artists who have been practicing drawing Spider-Man for 60 years.

822
00:57:55,039 --> 00:58:01,103
Speaker 0: So yeah, we've already talked for an hour, so I almost don't even want to get into, like, I guess we could spend a couple minutes.

823
00:58:01,123 --> 00:58:01,930
Speaker 0: Spoilers, I guess.

824
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:05,610
Speaker 1: There's, I mean, it's the plot is not that important.

825
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:07,306
Speaker 1: It's a really solid plot.

826
00:58:07,367 --> 00:58:08,721
Speaker 1: You care about the characters.

827
00:58:08,903 --> 00:58:11,083
Speaker 1: I guess they're acted well.

828
00:58:11,103 --> 00:58:22,619
Speaker 0: Specific scenes are things that, the fact that it's Beagle Guy and how they weave, like, the villain of the week into calling him a villain of the week becomes the meta plot.

829
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,209
Speaker 0: Like, every one of those threads ties so tightly.

830
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:29,709
Speaker 1: Well, it's also about, you know, Spider-Man is all about, you know, these villains of the week.

831
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:32,598
Speaker 1: Lots of weird ones.

832
00:58:32,941 --> 00:58:36,719
Speaker 1: And so to take one and to, I think that's also, that's the thing that's been done before.

833
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:40,190
Speaker 1: Taking a villain of the week and sort of leveling them up to being for real.

834
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:43,027
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a common trope in Spider-Man comics, in fact.

835
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:44,428
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

836
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:59,830
Speaker 0: But the style of the Gwen of, like, when they're in Gwen's universe, like, those painterly, diffuse, vague backgrounds everywhere, and how the colors literally change based on the emotional content of, like, what's happening.

837
00:59:00,671 --> 00:59:01,930
Speaker 1: You mean, like, what you do in comic books?

838
00:59:02,371 --> 00:59:02,777
Speaker 0: Yeah.

839
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:05,469
Speaker 0: Punk Spider-Man might be the best Spider-Man of all time.

840
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:10,376
Speaker 1: Yeah, whoever, like, whoever did the Punk Spider-Man is some sort of genius person.

841
00:59:10,436 --> 00:59:13,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, that Spider-Man is fantastic.

842
00:59:15,310 --> 00:59:18,076
Speaker 1: The mixture of the live-action stuff.

843
00:59:18,156 --> 00:59:20,880
Speaker 0: Yes, pull it, because it's every Spider-Man.

844
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:21,729
Speaker 0: Literally.

845
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:25,767
Speaker 1: It wasn't, they didn't do it, they didn't do it in a Roger Rabbit way, right?

846
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:34,195
Speaker 1: They didn't do it in a, uh, you know, it's like, there's been lots of things that have mixed the live-action and the animation previously, right?

847
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:41,185
Speaker 1: But this is doing it in, like, you know, I guess I've never seen anyone do it quite this way before, right?

848
00:59:41,367 --> 00:59:41,590
Speaker 0: Yep.

849
00:59:41,971 --> 00:59:51,849
Speaker 0: Well, 'cause they're all just Spider-Man, and it was heartfelt, and there's a little aside here that this was the first movie I have seen in a regular multiplex since COVID.

850
00:59:52,334 --> 00:59:54,537
Speaker 1: Like, I've only gone to- No, I've seen quite a few.

851
00:59:54,678 --> 00:59:56,658
Speaker 0: I haven't, we've only been going to really boutique theaters.

852
00:59:57,103 --> 01:00:00,010
Speaker 0: We went to an Alamo Drafthouse a little bit before this for another movie.

853
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:21,140
Speaker 0: But, uh, we were in a packed theater, like in a regular old, like regal multiplex, and I missed seeing a movie like this, where occasionally, like, it can be overdone, and it can be a problem, but when the crowd just sort of spontaneously all cheers at something at the same time, I do enjoy that feeling, that camaraderie.

854
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:27,463
Speaker 1: Well, so the Woo game, usually, is like a thing that's, like, bothersome, right?

855
01:00:27,544 --> 01:00:32,553
Speaker 1: It's like, "Oh, you're just getting a cheap cameo in there to make people go 'Woo,' right?

856
01:00:32,573 --> 01:00:35,037
Speaker 1: You got some fan service in there, right?

857
01:00:35,078 --> 01:00:37,446
Speaker 1: Just to audience pleasers and whatnot,

858
01:00:37,627 --> 01:00:37,789
Speaker 1: right?".

859
01:00:37,809 --> 01:00:37,870
Speaker 1: Yep.

860
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:42,392
Speaker 1: And usually, to me, that's cheap, that's not, you know, right?

861
01:00:42,432 --> 01:00:45,545
Speaker 0: Every one of these was heartfelt, made sense, fit into the movie.

862
01:00:45,586 --> 01:00:48,676
Speaker 1: The ones, right, the ones that they did, right?

863
01:00:48,736 --> 01:00:52,655
Speaker 1: I think the one that I can point to the most, right, is the Lego one.

864
01:00:52,776 --> 01:00:53,201
Speaker 1: Yeah!

865
01:00:53,221 --> 01:00:55,950
Speaker 1: They bring in Lego, they bring in Lego Spider-Man, right?

866
01:00:56,271 --> 01:00:57,503
Speaker 1: A crowd pleaser, right?

867
01:00:57,523 --> 01:01:00,815
Speaker 1: So, it's like, they bust out Lego Spider-Man, and everyone's like, "Woo!

868
01:01:00,956 --> 01:01:01,178
Speaker 1: Lego

869
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:01,421
Speaker 1: Spider-Man!".

870
01:01:01,441 --> 01:01:02,894
Speaker 1: You know, it's like, right?

871
01:01:03,096 --> 01:01:04,888
Speaker 1: We love Lego's Woo game, right?

872
01:01:06,353 --> 01:01:11,624
Speaker 1: And so, but, the amount of that scene for this Lego Spider-Man is really short.

873
01:01:11,665 --> 01:01:12,756
Speaker 1: It's got to be less 30 seconds.

874
01:01:12,756 --> 01:01:16,494
Speaker 1: 30 seconds, less than a minute, right?

875
01:01:16,918 --> 01:01:20,836
Speaker 1: And here's what's cram-packed into this 30 seconds to a minute of Lego Spider-Man.

876
01:01:20,856 --> 01:01:23,281
Speaker 1: Number one, they got Woo game in there, okay, right?

877
01:01:23,524 --> 01:01:28,839
Speaker 1: Number two, they're bringing in stop-motion animation into a film that is otherwise computer-animated.

878
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:38,514
Speaker 1: I'm sure computers are helping in some way, but it's like a whole different animation style, right, that I'm sure that they actually stop-motion those Legos with a camera, mostly for that scene, right?

879
01:01:40,088 --> 01:01:41,398
Speaker 1: Three, right?

880
01:01:41,601 --> 01:01:50,150
Speaker 1: You're bringing in the tired, old role of animation as a toy-selling machine, right?

881
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:55,909
Speaker 1: 'Cause I don't know how well Spider-Man Legos sell, but I bet you they're selling a little better today.

882
01:01:56,752 --> 01:01:59,009
Speaker 0: I think any Spider-Man thing is selling a little better today.

883
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:00,333
Speaker 1: Right?

884
01:02:00,414 --> 01:02:03,584
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, they made Spider-Man Legos look cool.

885
01:02:03,685 --> 01:02:06,130
Speaker 1: That was the best ad for Spider-Man Legos you could ever see.

886
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:09,629
Speaker 1: 'Cause I've looked at those sets and they don't seem really exciting Lego-wise, right?

887
01:02:10,573 --> 01:02:11,018
Speaker 1: But you know what?

888
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:13,709
Speaker 1: I could get just a Spider-Man Lego minifig only.

889
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:15,828
Speaker 1: And I would be very happy to get one of those.

890
01:02:17,558 --> 01:02:17,723
Speaker 1: Right?

891
01:02:17,743 --> 01:02:19,070
Speaker 1: They bring that in, right?

892
01:02:19,973 --> 01:02:21,590
Speaker 1: It's relevant to the plot that's happening.

893
01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:23,989
Speaker 1: So the plot of the movie advances a tiny bit.

894
01:02:24,812 --> 01:02:31,058
Speaker 1: And, right, they have a great joke, right, in that scene where it's like, "You're one of our

895
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:31,423
Speaker 1: best."

896
01:02:31,545 --> 01:02:34,738
Speaker 1: And it's like, right, where he tells the Lego Spider-Man, he's like, "You're one of our best

897
01:02:34,758 --> 01:02:35,345
Speaker 1: Spider-Men."

898
01:02:35,628 --> 01:02:35,770
Speaker 1: Right?

899
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:37,889
Speaker 1: And it's like, funny, 'cause he's a little Lego guy.

900
01:02:38,933 --> 01:02:40,028
Speaker 1: How good could he be?

901
01:02:41,033 --> 01:02:42,347
Speaker 1: But he's one of the best ones.

902
01:02:45,576 --> 01:02:56,350
Speaker 1: And it even shows like, I love how it shows like, you know, you also get a little bit of, you know, Spider-Man, you know, 'cause the whole J. Jonah Jameson thing in the newspaper is a big part of most Peter Parker Spider-Mans.

903
01:02:56,792 --> 01:03:00,110
Speaker 1: And it's not a part of the Miles Morales ones really at all, right?

904
01:03:00,431 --> 01:03:03,710
Speaker 1: So they can only sneak that in to the movie in other places.

905
01:03:04,472 --> 01:03:14,613
Speaker 1: And I think that's where it featured most prominently in this movie, 'cause you got the Lego Spider-Man, well, the Lego Peter Parker with his Lego camera in Jameson's office, like, "Yo, get me pictures of

906
01:03:14,634 --> 01:03:15,083
Speaker 1: Spider-Man!".

907
01:03:16,336 --> 01:03:18,430
Speaker 1: So they wedged that in there too, right?

908
01:03:19,115 --> 01:03:20,999
Speaker 1: All in a minute.

909
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:22,389
Speaker 1: They managed to do all of that.

910
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:23,412
Speaker 0: Right?

911
01:03:23,433 --> 01:03:23,597
Speaker 0: - Yup.

912
01:03:23,884 --> 01:03:25,603
Speaker 0: I think a thing that really...

913
01:03:25,623 --> 01:03:29,549
Speaker 1: - With a like a sheet of meta-commentary over the whole thing.

914
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:35,521
Speaker 0: - Then we've got the Bombay Mumbai-ish Spider-Man story, that whole...

915
01:03:35,542 --> 01:03:41,419
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I'm pretty sure that Spider-Man was, I didn't read it, but I think that they didn't, like, create that for this movie.

916
01:03:41,439 --> 01:03:42,570
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure that was in a comic.

917
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:57,950
Speaker 0: - But there was a moment, and it was relevant because we're in a theater with a bunch of people, because there's a moment where Spider-Man in that universe has to choose between saving someone on a bus or someone else in a different location.

918
01:03:58,632 --> 01:04:02,692
Speaker 0: And he tries to save both, which is a common trope in Spider-Man.

919
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:15,526
Speaker 0: Like, you see a scene that has happened in a lot of Spider-Men, and there's a moment where a lot of people in the audience, as soon as they saw the framing of that scene, gasped, and were like, "Oh, I know what's gonna

920
01:04:15,566 --> 01:04:15,829
Speaker 0: happen.".

921
01:04:16,212 --> 01:04:22,510
Speaker 0: And the fact that the movie not only inverts that, but the fact that it is inverted is a plot point.

922
01:04:22,631 --> 01:04:25,504
Speaker 0: that is part of the point of the entire trilogy.

923
01:04:25,828 --> 01:04:28,050
Speaker 0: Like, it is directly relevant to the story.

924
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:34,890
Speaker 0: The fact that that went down the way it went down, that was just a sublime, well done, not a misdirection.

925
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:36,127
Speaker 0: It was just a good scene.

926
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:41,196
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Spider-Man India was in a comic that was a limited series in 2004-2005.

927
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:44,469
Speaker 1: It was four issues.

928
01:04:45,472 --> 01:04:50,348
Speaker 1: And then Spider-Man India has also, again, reappeared, I guess, like in some cartoons and things like that.

929
01:04:51,230 --> 01:04:53,581
Speaker 1: But then, this is like, they brought him back big time.

930
01:04:53,661 --> 01:04:59,269
Speaker 1: A significant part of the movie is, you know, Spider-Man India.

931
01:04:59,633 --> 01:05:02,930
Speaker 0: So yeah, go, just go see this movie.

932
01:05:05,057 --> 01:05:06,370
Speaker 0: The highest possible recommendation.

933
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:18,441
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, I think we did an episode on Spider-Man, a Geek Nights episode on Spider-Man, and I talked about, I think I talked about how, like, I always like Spider-Man, right?

934
01:05:18,482 --> 01:05:20,708
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, Spider-Man's a New York guy.

935
01:05:22,030 --> 01:05:22,366
Speaker 0: Wisecracking.

936
01:05:23,877 --> 01:05:28,763
Speaker 1: Right, but it's like, you don't think of yourself as like a Spider-Man fan.

937
01:05:28,824 --> 01:05:31,430
Speaker 1: I'm not out there buying Spider-Man stuff, right?

938
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:34,847
Speaker 1: I made fun of that guy at the Comic-Con who only read Silver Age Spider-Man comics.

939
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:40,238
Speaker 1: You know, I never had like Spider-Man Halloween costume, right?

940
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:43,450
Speaker 1: But it's like, but when a Spider-Man hits, right?

941
01:05:43,872 --> 01:05:46,884
Speaker 1: It's like, I remember how much I like Spider-Man.

942
01:05:46,924 --> 01:05:49,167
Speaker 1: It's like, you don't realize how much you like it.

943
01:05:49,187 --> 01:05:58,728
Speaker 1: I often criticize other people for not understanding what they like or not being introspective or, you know, not knowing why they like what they like, right?

944
01:05:58,809 --> 01:06:04,968
Speaker 1: And things of that nature, but it's like, you know, I didn't, you know, I like Spider-Man more than I think I like Spider-Man.

945
01:06:05,931 --> 01:06:06,079
Speaker 1: Right?

946
01:06:07,972 --> 01:06:11,859
Speaker 0: Because you don't think about him day-to-day, but then a Spider-Man company hits and you're like, "Oh, Spider-Man.

947
01:06:12,062 --> 01:06:12,629
Speaker 1: I'll go check that

948
01:06:12,649 --> 01:06:12,710
Speaker 1: out.".

949
01:06:12,771 --> 01:06:15,737
Speaker 1: It's like, I'm just, even before the movie came out, it's like.

950
01:06:15,797 --> 01:06:17,759
Speaker 1: somehow I just got in a Spider-Man mood.

951
01:06:18,164 --> 01:06:31,129
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, but like, the other, you know, intellectual properties have not been as successful at like, you know, the Star Wars didn't get me in a Star Wars movie.

952
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:33,473
Speaker 0: We're not gushing about the Mario movie like this.

953
01:06:34,564 --> 01:06:36,402
Speaker 1: Mario didn't get me in a Mario mood.

954
01:06:36,483 --> 01:06:38,120
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go see that movie though at some point.

955
01:06:38,241 --> 01:06:38,605
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

956
01:06:38,625 --> 01:06:40,178
Speaker 0: Still in theaters, like all over the place.

957
01:06:40,643 --> 01:06:47,939
Speaker 1: But it's like, you know, I was able, like the fact that I can even have a Spider-Man mood of like, I'm feeling like Spider-Man.

958
01:06:47,979 --> 01:06:51,130
Speaker 1: I wanna go, I kinda wanna just go get a Spider-Man comic and read it.

959
01:06:51,271 --> 01:06:52,829
Speaker 1: I'm feeling, you know, like.

960
01:06:53,755 --> 01:06:55,980
Speaker 1: I can't get that feeling for the, you know, so.

961
01:06:56,060 --> 01:07:01,230
Speaker 0: But it just so happens that the Spider-Man we got now is one of the better movies ever made by humans.

962
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:03,877
Speaker 0: Like, just go watch this thing.

963
01:07:04,584 --> 01:07:06,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think you just hang this shit in the Louvre, right?

964
01:07:07,553 --> 01:07:09,593
Speaker 0: Just have it playing on a loop in the Louvre.

965
01:07:10,442 --> 01:07:12,019
Speaker 1: Just put, I mean it wouldn't be wrong.

966
01:07:18,042 --> 01:07:20,292
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

976
01:08:14,228 --> 01:08:15,500
Speaker 0: So we are resuming.

977
01:08:15,844 --> 01:08:23,799

01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:27,459
Speaker 0: So I figured anyone who listens to the end here, I want to let you know that that's something we're looking at.

979
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:34,571
Speaker 0: It seems like it's finally time to kick that kind of thing off, so tentatively, around the end of fall of 2024 is where I'm looking.

980
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:36,307
Speaker 0: Got some leads.

981
01:08:36,913 --> 01:08:37,803
Speaker 0: Let's leave that with you.

982
01:08:37,884 --> 01:09:00,100
Speaker 0: Tonight, I'll simply leave you with... A human being who lives on the other side of the rainbow.

983
01:09:00,121 --> 01:09:00,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, alright.

984
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:02,814
Speaker 0: *whistles* Megan.

985
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:04,062
Speaker 0: Megan.

986
01:09:04,082 --> 01:09:05,870
Speaker 0: We need your help, Megan.

987
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:07,335
Speaker 0: What?

988
01:09:10,036 --> 01:09:11,069
Speaker 0: We need your help, Megan.

989
01:09:11,390 --> 01:09:11,734
Speaker 0: Again?

990
01:09:11,956 --> 01:09:13,710
Speaker 0: All the flutter ponies have been captured.

991
01:09:15,031 --> 01:09:15,413
Speaker 1: Again?

992
01:09:15,434 --> 01:09:18,562
Speaker 0: Will you come back and help us defeat the people and free our friends?

993
01:09:18,622 --> 01:09:20,117
Speaker 1: Can't the other ponies help?

994
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:22,109
Speaker 0: They have also all been captured.

995
01:09:23,212 --> 01:09:24,706
Speaker 0: You're the only one who can help, Megan.

996
01:09:24,948 --> 01:09:28,493
Speaker 0: We need your human mongous brain and dextrous fingers to rescue them.

997
01:09:28,513 --> 01:09:28,553
Speaker 0: Um...

998
01:09:32,282 --> 01:09:32,537
Speaker 1: Okay.

999
01:09:34,368 --> 01:09:34,671
Speaker 0: *whistles* Hey.

1000
01:09:34,834 --> 01:09:35,359
Speaker 0: Nah, crap.

1001
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:36,653
Speaker 0: Let the ponies go.

1002
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:37,867
Speaker 1: The fuck are you supposed to be?

1003
01:09:37,968 --> 01:09:39,511
Speaker 1: No, I said let the ponies go.

1004
01:09:39,635 --> 01:09:39,718
Speaker 1: No.
