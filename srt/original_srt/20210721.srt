1
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,346
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday July 21st 2021.

2
00:00:09,346 --> 00:00:09,847
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:09,867 --> 00:00:11,451
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:11,471 --> 00:00:17,719
Speaker 0: tonight We are talking about old Hanna-barbera cartoons.

5
00:00:19,203 --> 00:00:20,218
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:24,282 --> 00:00:33,491
Speaker 0: So, uh just because I tend to be pretty lucky and other than injuries like I almost never get seriously sick I don't really have any reason to go to a doctor.

7
00:00:34,155 --> 00:00:34,880
Speaker 1: So I'm disease.

8
00:00:35,624 --> 00:00:38,760
Speaker 0: Yep, that was God that was horrifying horrifying food poisoning.

9
00:00:38,981 --> 00:00:45,400
Speaker 0: So the last two times I've been to a doctor for something serious were injuries and that's over the past like five years.

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,530
Speaker 0: Lyme disease was like I was still working at IBM.

11
00:00:48,354 --> 00:00:49,539
Speaker 0: I hadn't even graduated from our IT.

12
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,907
Speaker 0: yet I actually had to go back and finish my senior year.

13
00:00:51,987 --> 00:00:53,552
Speaker 1: severe severe allergy.

14
00:00:53,592 --> 00:00:55,137
Speaker 1: Like you couldn't even breathe at night.

15
00:00:55,599 --> 00:00:57,751
Speaker 0: that Actually, that's never happened to me.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,369
Speaker 1: I thought you had like a Like a some allergy thing.

17
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:03,958
Speaker 1: Oh, no, was that like a reflux?

18
00:01:04,018 --> 00:01:05,186
Speaker 1: was That was?

19
00:01:05,287 --> 00:01:07,040
Speaker 0: I had bad heartburn at at RIT.

20
00:01:07,361 --> 00:01:13,570
Speaker 0: Like so bad that I went to the doctor and the end result of all that they were like How many hours of sleep do you get on an average night?

21
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:14,574
Speaker 0: and don't lie to us?

22
00:01:14,915 --> 00:01:18,811
Speaker 0: and I answered honestly And the doctor was like, I'm not prescribing you anything.

23
00:01:19,072 --> 00:01:23,327
Speaker 0: sleep at least six hours a night for a week And I will bet you money.

24
00:01:23,387 --> 00:01:27,439
Speaker 0: it goes away and guess what it disappeared completely if I got at least six hours of sleep.

25
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,707
Speaker 0: Sure That was during that era, you know, there's that.

26
00:01:30,727 --> 00:01:35,191
Speaker 0: there's an era at RIT where Scott I recognize this, you know We were freshmen hanging out.

27
00:01:35,211 --> 00:01:36,280
Speaker 0: There was a whole new experience.

28
00:01:36,861 --> 00:01:47,392
Speaker 0: We'd stay up to like 11 hanging out then we'd stay up to like midnight Hanging out and then over that year in the next year We started to push that boundary further and further and further.

29
00:01:47,452 --> 00:01:50,919
Speaker 0: then we hit a point that was too late Like we were saying.

30
00:01:52,161 --> 00:01:53,287
Speaker 1: Is that one time we

31
00:01:53,328 --> 00:01:58,420
Speaker 0: were staying out to like two three in the morning and it was like, okay We got a fucking sleep cuz we do actually have classes sometimes

32
00:02:00,425 --> 00:02:01,038
Speaker 1: That bonitis

33
00:02:01,883 --> 00:02:18,116
Speaker 0: yep, so, uh, I and actually the last I got a physical three years ago and I got a physical two years before that because generally every time I get a physical my doctors tell me I don't need to come Back anytime soon unless I have a complaint until I turn 40. and since I turned 40 next year.

34
00:02:18,136 --> 00:02:20,144
Speaker 0: I figured alright I'm gonna get a physical.

35
00:02:20,205 --> 00:02:20,948
Speaker 0: it's been three years.

36
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:23,220
Speaker 0: Just make sure there's nothing wrong that I don't know about.

37
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:28,460
Speaker 0: You know, like the blood work might say oh you got a thing like there's boat there's laden bonitis just ready to come out.

38
00:02:29,263 --> 00:02:30,237
Speaker 0: So, um, I got.

39
00:02:30,278 --> 00:02:36,897
Speaker 1: I Returned Bonitis to the boning electric bonaloo.

40
00:02:38,562 --> 00:02:41,500
Speaker 0: So I got up physical for the first time in three years today.

41
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,440
Speaker 0: And of course, I saw a different doctor because my PCP who I see so rarely is on like long-term leave.

42
00:02:47,762 --> 00:02:49,411
Speaker 0: so I just went to some random other doctor.

43
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:54,127
Speaker 0: they had all my charts like it didn't matter and And They read through my chart and they looked at me.

44
00:02:54,368 --> 00:02:58,878
Speaker 0: and what the lady said was that I was and I'm not exaggerating I'm saying exactly what she said.

45
00:02:59,761 --> 00:03:02,090
Speaker 0: You're the healthiest and most fit person I've ever seen.

46
00:03:02,612 --> 00:03:02,752
Speaker 0: like.

47
00:03:02,772 --> 00:03:06,849
Speaker 0: you don't need to come back in anytime soon But I don't know what to tell.

48
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:08,279
Speaker 0: you come back in a few years.

49
00:03:09,261 --> 00:03:10,345
Speaker 0: Do you want to schedule your?

50
00:03:10,386 --> 00:03:13,880
Speaker 0: you know, you're gonna be 40. you want to schedule a colonoscopy at some point?

51
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,874
Speaker 0: Just because and otherwise she was like, yeah, I got nothing for you.

52
00:03:18,296 --> 00:03:19,320
Speaker 1: Keep doing what they say to me.

53
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:22,173
Speaker 1: They say to me the dentist they're like, well your teeth are clean.

54
00:03:22,193 --> 00:03:23,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not quite.

55
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,915
Speaker 0: I'm not as that lucky at the dentist.

56
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:29,633
Speaker 0: the dentist They're more like, yep Your teeth were fucked up the way you described from eight years of braces as a kid.

57
00:03:29,654 --> 00:03:30,778
Speaker 0: There's nothing we can do about that.

58
00:03:33,261 --> 00:03:37,484
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah pending blood work I seemed I seemed to still be doing okay trucking along.

59
00:03:37,544 --> 00:03:56,211
Speaker 0: the only funny thing was she asked about my diet and And real with my weight and everything and she basically said that I should eat a lot more carbs than I do Like specifically like eat more carbs for the love of God not to gain weight But because my blood sugar is like always really low Because I just don't eat enough food.

60
00:03:56,272 --> 00:04:00,856
Speaker 0: compared to my activity level I'm not at the level where like and my fat like the body fat and all that combined.

61
00:04:00,876 --> 00:04:10,197
Speaker 0: She basically said like My blood sugar probably gets way too low way too often because I'm straddling this line Just from how little I eat compared to how much exercise I get.

62
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:12,545
Speaker 1: Thanks so much.

63
00:04:12,806 --> 00:04:19,007
Speaker 0: No, actually she said exercise more just eat more - Okay, that was the most exciting.

64
00:04:19,027 --> 00:04:20,051
Speaker 0: There's still COVID like I'd like.

65
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,987
Speaker 0: while we're like seeing friends bit by bit and starting to do stuff It's not like I can go on a big trip or anything.

66
00:04:25,609 --> 00:04:32,025
Speaker 0: So that physical was the most exciting thing that's happened to me recently Doctor's office the only.

67
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:33,592
Speaker 1: I'm surprised they're even doing physicals.

68
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,100
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, there's a pandemic.

69
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,778
Speaker 1: Why would you waste time doing you know?

70
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,683
Speaker 0: yeah, they actually.

71
00:04:37,723 --> 00:04:43,606
Speaker 0: so they had sort of said yeah hold off on anything not essential like last year and I'd be basically stuck.

72
00:04:43,646 --> 00:04:54,284
Speaker 0: though the email I got was like, yeah, you know last year was rough But this year you should start scheduling your preventative treatment type stuff again Unless you have a good reason not to Maybe next year.

73
00:04:54,725 --> 00:04:56,692
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I did been three years.

74
00:04:56,752 --> 00:04:57,535
Speaker 0: I figured like it was.

75
00:04:57,555 --> 00:04:59,060
Speaker 0: probably I should get one just in case.

76
00:05:00,921 --> 00:05:04,207
Speaker 0: But meanwhile yesterday You know, we got up.

77
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:15,445
Speaker 0: I was doing my thing just working and There's a funny smell like in the apartment and it was a kind of ozone II kind of Bernie and I was like Yeah, it doesn't seem right.

78
00:05:15,465 --> 00:05:19,120
Speaker 0: and then I went over to the balcony and I just felt stronger.

79
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,200
Speaker 0: So I opened the door and it smelled like everything was on fire.

80
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,264
Speaker 0: And then of course I checked.

81
00:05:23,445 --> 00:05:30,954
Speaker 0: the wildfire smoke had made it to New York way more than it ever has Like it started way across the country.

82
00:05:30,974 --> 00:05:42,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay in Canada The AQI in New York City yesterday was 170 which is like the chart usually shows like 0 to 50 is like green.

83
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,712
Speaker 0: 50 to 100 is like yellow like yeah, it's not great.

84
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:47,875
Speaker 0: up to 150 is like a orange.

85
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,792
Speaker 0: you should probably like don't go run them don't go.

86
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:59,336
Speaker 0: run 10 miles outside and 150 up is usually red like do not go outside.

87
00:05:59,397 --> 00:06:00,260
Speaker 0: This is dangerous.

88
00:06:01,602 --> 00:06:06,144
Speaker 1: The thing that bothers me the most is when there is an AQI Situation right?

89
00:06:06,185 --> 00:06:07,870
Speaker 1: They're always like don't go outside.

90
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:08,732
Speaker 0: Don't exercise.

91
00:06:09,334 --> 00:06:10,297
Speaker 1: Don't exercise.

92
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:11,160
Speaker 1: Don't go outside.

93
00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:12,023
Speaker 1: Don't you know.

94
00:06:12,043 --> 00:06:16,800
Speaker 0: and that's true because it's actually dangerous like it could hurt your lungs like depending on the kind of course it could.

95
00:06:16,861 --> 00:06:22,593
Speaker 1: Right, that's I'm not saying that's not true Yeah, but what I'm saying is that it's a very victim-blamey thing.

96
00:06:22,634 --> 00:06:25,134
Speaker 0: what they would that is a very u.s Thing I have been in.

97
00:06:25,195 --> 00:06:27,432
Speaker 1: France Is high.

98
00:06:27,992 --> 00:06:32,699
Speaker 1: when the AQI is high they should say don't drive no driving allowed period.

99
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:34,768
Speaker 0: I have been in places Outside of the u.s.

100
00:06:34,808 --> 00:06:35,513
Speaker 0: Where that happens.

101
00:06:35,634 --> 00:06:37,981
Speaker 0: I was in Singapore Makes sense.

102
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:42,329
Speaker 0: Yeah, like Singapore Paris both places have like Paris.

103
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:46,880
Speaker 0: They were like, yep Congestion charges are bigger because of this or don't drive.

104
00:06:47,081 --> 00:06:56,700
Speaker 1: a friend on Twitter Suggested that when the AQI is high that you just jack up all the tolls on everything to be like a hundred dollars plus.

105
00:06:56,941 --> 00:06:57,222
Speaker 1: Right.

106
00:06:57,604 --> 00:06:59,512
Speaker 0: I've seen places where they do things like yep.

107
00:06:59,632 --> 00:07:01,580
Speaker 0: fireworks are now banned until further notice.

108
00:07:03,726 --> 00:07:06,263
Speaker 1: Anyway That's at all times.

109
00:07:06,564 --> 00:07:08,228
Speaker 1: Yeah doesn't stop anybody.

110
00:07:08,549 --> 00:07:12,680
Speaker 0: Well, the congestion charges at least for Manhattan are slowly working through.

111
00:07:13,563 --> 00:07:19,712
Speaker 1: Sure, but the point is we are capable of putting, you know, stop trade, you know We do.

112
00:07:19,732 --> 00:07:20,820
Speaker 1: they did them during the hurricane.

113
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,200
Speaker 0: They said no transportation don't you can't go anywhere as humans are capable of a lot of things.

114
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:32,160
Speaker 0: The problem is we're bad at executing on those things because half of us want to change the same things.

115
00:07:32,882 --> 00:07:38,658
Speaker 1: Just do the same transportation ban you do when a hurricane is coming when there's an AQI problem growing.

116
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:49,958
Speaker 0: agreed But the problem is half of America even a lot of people in place like New York City like it's still 20 or 30 percent of the people here a Want objectively bad things on purpose?

117
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,622
Speaker 1: So too bad.

118
00:07:52,404 --> 00:07:57,279
Speaker 1: and also I know that this particular AQI incident was due to fires far away bad.

119
00:07:57,339 --> 00:08:01,566
Speaker 1: right now It's like but if you turn off the cars Then that would.

120
00:08:01,626 --> 00:08:03,276
Speaker 1: so it would probably bring it down from 150 to like.

121
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,393
Speaker 1: Oh, that was something that you know really stood out during the pandemic.

122
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:13,035
Speaker 0: like last year that summer New York City's air was so good.

123
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:18,796
Speaker 0: It was like Startling like it like it will stick with me because this summer it's completely it's.

124
00:08:18,836 --> 00:08:27,583
Speaker 0: not only is it back to normal But the air is way worse because traffic in New York City is not just at an all-time high for like New York City Which it is.

125
00:08:27,603 --> 00:08:30,476
Speaker 0: It is also at an all-time high for all of America.

126
00:08:30,556 --> 00:08:37,059
Speaker 0: right now We literally have the worst traffic in America and the worst traffic New York City has ever had.

127
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:42,240
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, but last time and the air is shit now like the air is just shit here like it always is.

128
00:08:43,183 --> 00:08:56,600
Speaker 0: Last summer the air was so good that like I smelled things in Manhattan that I'd never smelled before some of them not great But I also smelled good things like I smelled a lot more flowers.

129
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:15,163
Speaker 0: and If I look at my Strava like just my biking times my running times everything Even at the start of COVID not toward the end of last summer where I'd been running like a maniac and like just getting better At it my times were just better like at the start of last summer and I think it's partly just because the air was way better Mm-hmm.

130
00:09:15,705 --> 00:09:23,740
Speaker 0: I can't prove that but I have data that shows I was like 15% faster at the start of last running season compared to any other running season in my life.

131
00:09:24,922 --> 00:09:27,259
Speaker 0: No, and the only difference was the air was way better.

132
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:32,388
Speaker 0: So yeah, anyway, we got some news.

133
00:09:32,468 --> 00:09:41,494
Speaker 0: I guess what I want to start with is we have not seen it yet, but Bell Hosts Mamoru Hosanna's upcoming movie his latest work current upcoming.

134
00:09:41,534 --> 00:09:41,855
Speaker 1: It's out.

135
00:09:41,996 --> 00:09:42,417
Speaker 0: Well, it's out.

136
00:09:42,437 --> 00:09:43,847
Speaker 0: I mean, we haven't seen it yet It's out.

137
00:09:43,928 --> 00:09:44,698
Speaker 0: Is it out everywhere?

138
00:09:45,581 --> 00:09:46,405
Speaker 0: Cuz it depends.

139
00:09:46,988 --> 00:09:49,440
Speaker 1: It's the number one movie in the J at the Japanese box office.

140
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know people with you know, the Olympics can't have spectators, but people can go to the movie theater to see this.

141
00:09:55,121 --> 00:10:01,568
Speaker 0: Yeah, uh, but I think what's notable is we talked about how it's coming like how we're excited about it How it appears like it's gonna be good.

142
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:02,714
Speaker 0: It's track record.

143
00:10:02,754 --> 00:10:03,800
Speaker 0: Let's just bet in a thousand.

144
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,979
Speaker 0: So, you know Babe Ruth is coming up to the bat and odds are he's gonna hit another home run.

145
00:10:09,664 --> 00:10:12,080
Speaker 0: But something moderately phenomenal happened.

146
00:10:12,401 --> 00:10:21,360
Speaker 0: I say moderately because the caveat of this is this is a kind of performative thing that happens at Cannes like it's happened before but on can.

147
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:30,170
Speaker 0: but So when the film was shown there It got a 14 minute standing ovation from the audience.

148
00:10:30,752 --> 00:10:33,640
Speaker 0: the record in the history of this festival was pans labyrinth.

149
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:36,390
Speaker 0: With 22 minutes labyrinth is overrated.

150
00:10:36,651 --> 00:10:37,976
Speaker 1: I mean, I would say it is.

151
00:10:38,177 --> 00:10:39,080
Speaker 1: I like it all I like.

152
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,245
Speaker 1: I think it is correctly rated.

153
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:48,175
Speaker 1: I Think people I mean my impression is that people absolutely lose their shit over patents.

154
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:49,820
Speaker 1: labyrinth like oh, it's some fucking incredible.

155
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,851
Speaker 1: And I'm like, it's really good, but it's not fucking credible.

156
00:10:52,932 --> 00:10:53,936
Speaker 0: I would say it's incredible.

157
00:10:54,136 --> 00:10:55,060
Speaker 0: It's on the lower end.

158
00:10:56,805 --> 00:10:57,410
Speaker 1: I don't think so.

159
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,720
Speaker 0: It's a better movie than citizen Kane.

160
00:11:00,522 --> 00:11:05,739
Speaker 0: I Would argue from a structural standpoint it is a better-made movie.

161
00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:11,419
Speaker 0: Granted the difference is citizen Kane did some techniques that weren't widely done or had never been done.

162
00:11:12,202 --> 00:11:13,165
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, I mean citizen.

163
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:14,911
Speaker 1: it's like a Mona Lisa situation like is them?

164
00:11:14,992 --> 00:11:15,493
Speaker 1: how great?

165
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,360
Speaker 1: do you want a moment Lisa on your wall?

166
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,630
Speaker 1: Do you want a citizen can't on your wall?

167
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,565
Speaker 1: No, but they basically invented.

168
00:11:20,585 --> 00:11:23,744
Speaker 1: it's like but The other.

169
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:27,240
Speaker 0: but so it's notable that an anime got such a response.

170
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:36,600
Speaker 0: But it's also notable that the few reviews I've seen or like candid statements from Everyone who wrote a review wrote like oh my god, they lost their shit.

171
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,643
Speaker 0: I have not seen.

172
00:11:38,085 --> 00:11:44,063
Speaker 0: the worst review I saw said that this is the best movie of the year and something like The level.

173
00:11:44,484 --> 00:11:44,785
Speaker 0: I'm not.

174
00:11:44,885 --> 00:11:46,229
Speaker 0: I'm not saying it's hyperbole.

175
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:51,598
Speaker 0: it very well could be but people are acting like this is the greatest movie They have ever seen in their life.

176
00:11:52,444 --> 00:11:59,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, so what I found out actually is I knew That the fact that it was called Belle that it had some relation to you know beauty.

177
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,974
Speaker 0: Oh, I assume Beauty and the Beast from that 10-second teaser pre teaser trailer.

178
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:03,997
Speaker 0: We saw of course.

179
00:12:04,017 --> 00:12:05,803
Speaker 1: That's that's obvious It's not a secret at all.

180
00:12:05,863 --> 00:12:12,822
Speaker 1: But what I found out was that the actual Japanese title of this movie is Belle.

181
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:19,085
Speaker 1: Colin Probably pronouncing this wrong Ryuto Sobokaso.

182
00:12:19,266 --> 00:12:32,174
Speaker 1: Sobokaso know he may which the dragon princess Colin the dragon and the freckled princess, so it's instead of a beast instead of Beauty and the Beast It's the Beast but replace the Beast of the dragon.

183
00:12:32,195 --> 00:12:40,590
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah drag Alrighty, you're speaking to hand and replace Beauty with freckled princess and see you then you reverse them So the monster comes before the end.

184
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:46,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's like Beast and the Beauty But you replace Beast with dragon and Beauty with freckled princess.

185
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:54,658
Speaker 0: So you're already speaking my language and - it's set as we know in a world where there is an online Virtuality like metaverse very similar.

186
00:12:54,698 --> 00:13:01,419
Speaker 0: Yeah It's only you could almost argue that it's like it's set in the same universe as summer wars Just in like the future where the technology got better.

187
00:13:02,201 --> 00:13:04,491
Speaker 1: Maybe I don't know but there was an interview with hosted it.

188
00:13:04,511 --> 00:13:08,520
Speaker 1: that's going around very brief and you know He took some shots at Miyazaki in the interview.

189
00:13:08,761 --> 00:13:12,200
Speaker 0: I was gonna talk about that next is a little bit very very entertaining.

190
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:21,440
Speaker 1: But the other thing he said in the interview is like look, you know We keep making all the media we keep making is like Oh internet bad internet scary, right?

191
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:22,583
Speaker 1: Right.

192
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:26,279
Speaker 1: He's like network like he's like the Internet's just a reality now.

193
00:13:26,862 --> 00:13:29,532
Speaker 1: So he's like he's you know, and you can see try.

194
00:13:29,572 --> 00:13:42,300
Speaker 1: he's trying quite obviously To create media with somewhat positive, you know out, you know internet Like the moral of summer wars was not that internet system.

195
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,552
Speaker 0: We have to take it down before it.

196
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,741
Speaker 0: Skynet stuffs The more.

197
00:13:44,781 --> 00:13:49,340
Speaker 0: the moral of that was a bunch of other stuff and there were both positive and negative aspects of that.

198
00:13:50,682 --> 00:13:55,138
Speaker 1: So Digimon summer wars and now Belle he just he's done three internet movies, right?

199
00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:57,819
Speaker 1: Yeah So that's pretty cool.

200
00:13:58,101 --> 00:14:04,360
Speaker 1: And you know also you thought was I've been thinking independently recently which I guess I'm in alignment with him in some way, right?

201
00:14:05,865 --> 00:14:22,060
Speaker 1: And you know, we see you look back in time at you know Popular media, especially sci-fi stuff, right and there was Sort of an optimistic side of things in 50s and 60s, you know, you had like, you know world of tomorrow type stuff going on.

202
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:30,397
Speaker 1: Yeah, and nowadays almost all Sci-fi stuff is some sort of dystopian, you know, um play gods.

203
00:14:30,598 --> 00:14:33,019
Speaker 1: Yeah So it's it's sort of nice.

204
00:14:33,784 --> 00:14:35,676
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, there are some other people not doing.

205
00:14:35,696 --> 00:14:37,808
Speaker 0: there's a chance We could not fuck this up.

206
00:14:37,848 --> 00:14:40,080
Speaker 0: and there are good things that have come out of all of this.

207
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,040
Speaker 1: There is some mean things aren't looking good.

208
00:14:42,141 --> 00:14:44,379
Speaker 1: It sure looks like in the real world we am play God.

209
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:51,060
Speaker 0: Well, cuz our equivalent of all these online universes for most people in America is basically Facebook, which is right.

210
00:14:52,161 --> 00:14:54,893
Speaker 1: In the real world, we clearly am play gods.

211
00:14:55,094 --> 00:15:07,060
Speaker 1: in most sci-fi stuff You know is telling a story of warning us stop playing gods, but it's nice to see some sort of Positive outlook like hey the internet can be a good thing for humanity.

212
00:15:07,522 --> 00:15:11,058
Speaker 1: Here is let me show you a world in which that is true, right?

213
00:15:13,081 --> 00:15:13,385
Speaker 1: Yeah like that.

214
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:17,967
Speaker 1: So, uh, even I'm not we need to even if it's false.

215
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:19,612
Speaker 0: Oh, but I guess also like.

216
00:15:19,772 --> 00:15:26,930
Speaker 0: I am NOT going to Come in to finally seeing this movie Expecting it to be the greatest film I've ever seen.

217
00:15:27,432 --> 00:15:36,960
Speaker 0: but I have never seen This level of just got like this type of discussion at this level right from so many voices from a movie in my life.

218
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,516
Speaker 1: It's ya know all we've seen plenty of anime movies coming right from.

219
00:15:42,536 --> 00:15:55,220
Speaker 1: you know Any kind of movie like there been high fives making all these movies, right, you know There wasn't hype for any other previous hosted a movie in this fashion, right?

220
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,160
Speaker 0: But I'm saying I have not seen this level of hype for really Mirai almost any movie.

221
00:16:01,382 --> 00:16:14,876
Speaker 0: You know a lot of them were well received But they were not hyped this extensively like just the the uniformity of voices who very rarely would say something so hyperbolic saying that it's the greatest film they've seen is.

222
00:16:14,896 --> 00:16:24,060
Speaker 0: I 'm just trying not to Read into that too much and come into this movie with expectations, but this movie could be really good.

223
00:16:25,242 --> 00:16:25,905
Speaker 1: It could also be.

224
00:16:25,965 --> 00:16:31,404
Speaker 1: those are the same people who you know overate Pan's Labyrinth and it won't be incredible It'll just be really good.

225
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:33,491
Speaker 0: I mean, I still think Pan's Labyrinth is incredible.

226
00:16:34,253 --> 00:16:34,775
Speaker 1: I don't think so.

227
00:16:35,477 --> 00:16:37,859
Speaker 1: Okay, so It's just really good.

228
00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:39,865
Speaker 0: Anyway, and that thing you alluded to.

229
00:16:39,986 --> 00:16:47,149
Speaker 0: so I'm gonna go through a little thread of a Twitter conversation here because there's an article on the Japan Times where you get a like.

230
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:48,797
Speaker 0: it's a bunch of stuff on my more hosted.

231
00:16:48,837 --> 00:16:49,420
Speaker 0: You can just read it.

232
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,359
Speaker 0: It's a pretty good article, but we got some choice.

233
00:16:53,506 --> 00:17:00,152
Speaker 0: Notes That he had some comments on how Miyazaki Handled female heroines and you can.

234
00:17:00,192 --> 00:17:01,900
Speaker 1: well, I learned some things from this art.

235
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:03,406
Speaker 0: Oh, I learned some things too.

236
00:17:03,969 --> 00:17:08,477
Speaker 1: I did not know that he worked on any amount of Utena under a different name.

237
00:17:08,497 --> 00:17:15,940
Speaker 0: Yep So mom our hopes that I worked on a bunch of episodes of utenna doing doing storyboards and key animation.

238
00:17:16,382 --> 00:17:19,415
Speaker 0: In fact, it appears that he storyboarded the last episode.

239
00:17:19,435 --> 00:17:23,576
Speaker 1: I Also did not know but he did it under this name Katsu.

240
00:17:23,596 --> 00:17:24,400
Speaker 0: Yo Hashimoto.

241
00:17:25,201 --> 00:17:27,411
Speaker 0: Sure, and that is the only thing.

242
00:17:27,472 --> 00:17:40,300
Speaker 0: he did that under that name except He also was a unit director for stem or a Champloo under that name and I can't find any information on why you use that Name for those three projects and nothing else like no one's written anything about this that I can find.

243
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,160
Speaker 1: Usually it's because you're supposed to be working on one thing and you got a side project, right?

244
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, but he did a lot a lot of reasons that artists use names.

245
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,020
Speaker 1: You know songwriters use different names all the way.

246
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:56,199
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'm saying he has a huge portfolio and the only works he ever used a pseudonym on where?

247
00:17:57,001 --> 00:17:57,363
Speaker 1: It's not.

248
00:17:57,524 --> 00:18:05,710
Speaker 1: pseudonyms are not are not anything to like, you know care about Never a big deal or have any interesting reasons behind.

249
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,418
Speaker 0: but he used it for three different films that are not.

250
00:18:08,499 --> 00:18:12,515
Speaker 1: it's probably you know It's most likely just like boring old royalties reasons or something like that, right?

251
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:13,118
Speaker 1: It's never.

252
00:18:13,318 --> 00:18:13,640
Speaker 0: those things.

253
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,567
Speaker 0: Those things can be very interesting.

254
00:18:16,587 --> 00:18:17,551
Speaker 0: I'm not saying it's suspicious.

255
00:18:17,591 --> 00:18:18,315
Speaker 0: I'm think it's interesting.

256
00:18:18,335 --> 00:18:19,600
Speaker 1: They're almost never interesting.

257
00:18:20,082 --> 00:18:23,353
Speaker 1: I often find those songwriters who use different pseudonyms.

258
00:18:23,474 --> 00:18:24,216
Speaker 1: It's because they're.

259
00:18:24,377 --> 00:18:25,280
Speaker 1: they're a songwriter.

260
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:32,122
Speaker 1: they could write any kind of music and they use different song names for different genres for branding purposes and or Separating.

261
00:18:32,162 --> 00:18:34,088
Speaker 1: there's music amongst different publishers.

262
00:18:34,108 --> 00:18:37,277
Speaker 1: They'll sign a deal under one name and send a different deal under another name.

263
00:18:37,678 --> 00:18:38,200
Speaker 1: things like that.

264
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:45,620
Speaker 0: Storyboarded six episodes of utenna that are all pivotal pivotal ones and he storyboarded a chunk of the utenna movie, right?

265
00:18:46,063 --> 00:19:00,780
Speaker 1: okay, anyway the point the other city major thing that I learned that I did not know is he actually was the director of how's moving castle but Halfway through he was like fuck this and he got out of there and that's why he's not the director of house moving.

266
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,124
Speaker 0: That's a movie.

267
00:19:02,264 --> 00:19:07,200
Speaker 1: I think that's that is a huge information that I guess other people may have already known that I did not know.

268
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:12,577
Speaker 0: I feel like that movie would have been a lot better if he had actually been the director to the end.

269
00:19:12,878 --> 00:19:17,613
Speaker 1: quite I quite agree, but that gives a lot more knowing.

270
00:19:17,653 --> 00:19:21,204
Speaker 1: that gives much more weight to his Miyazaki zing.

271
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:24,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you can read about the Miyazaki zing.

272
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:29,180
Speaker 0: Oh, no We because we're getting back into our lives a little bit and we've been skipping to some geek nights.

273
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:34,219
Speaker 0: We tend to go way long in the news because Scott and I don't even have time to talk that often except during making the show.

274
00:19:35,362 --> 00:19:39,379
Speaker 0: So all our episodes have been super long lately, but you can read that quote yourself.

275
00:19:39,399 --> 00:19:47,380
Speaker 0: and there's also a thread of the utenna people who Figured all this out and they're talking a lot about huh?

276
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:56,786
Speaker 0: the episodes he worked on were pivotal around jury the character specifically and he seems to have Storyboarded away from the original script.

277
00:19:57,106 --> 00:20:06,446
Speaker 0: There's a And I want to read.

278
00:20:06,566 --> 00:20:13,840
Speaker 0: I'm gonna dig more into that but I don't know enough But I see a bunch of people trying to do that research and like digging hard to get evidence of that.

279
00:20:14,028 --> 00:20:23,299
Speaker 0: Yeah so this Conversation is like ongoing Among people who are trying to figure it out and I'm just gonna keep an eye on them and see if there's anything interesting there Or at least some specifics to corroborate it.

280
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:29,000
Speaker 1: Mmm, so I think I think it won't be until you know, this is coming out this year.

281
00:20:29,141 --> 00:20:34,350
Speaker 1: I don't know if we're gonna see another Big anime movie from anyone until next.

282
00:20:34,591 --> 00:20:38,645
Speaker 0: Yeah, and in terms of animation about the scheduling We still have a backlog.

283
00:20:38,786 --> 00:20:42,100
Speaker 0: you was is or we have a big backlog of animated movies?

284
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,020
Speaker 0: We still got a watch and review on gig nights not even anime like you didn't see legend of hay yet.

285
00:20:47,761 --> 00:20:52,523
Speaker 0: No, and that's not really it Mike legend of hay is they like a tier Animated movie?

286
00:20:52,563 --> 00:20:54,569
Speaker 0: it is fantastic and I think you'll really like it.

287
00:20:57,648 --> 00:20:59,799
Speaker 0: Anyway, so you had a thing you want to talk about the Popeye.

288
00:21:01,198 --> 00:21:05,220
Speaker 1: Oh Yeah, so this isn't really so much a news really.

289
00:21:05,822 --> 00:21:09,999
Speaker 1: It's just a thing that I've discovered recently because someone else I follow has been retweeting it.

290
00:21:10,722 --> 00:21:20,359
Speaker 1: So there is an official Popeye Twitter account that I assume is run by some marketing social media manager Who must work for whoever owns Popeye right now?

291
00:21:22,022 --> 00:21:22,787
Speaker 1: I don't know who that is.

292
00:21:22,807 --> 00:21:24,878
Speaker 1: I could probably google it really easily but so can you.

293
00:21:24,898 --> 00:21:27,605
Speaker 1: and I was just really.

294
00:21:28,308 --> 00:21:31,379
Speaker 0: I just noticed what the actual name of the account is the at name.

295
00:21:32,862 --> 00:21:49,666
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this account is run very very well But it is also extremely like, you know pro LGBTQ and leans hard into the fact that you know Popeye is basically like.

296
00:21:49,686 --> 00:21:58,840
Speaker 1: I don't know what he what he qualifies as gender wise but it's not a system amphibious Yeah Right.

297
00:22:00,163 --> 00:22:01,999
Speaker 1: So I just think that it's really kind of awesome.

298
00:22:03,182 --> 00:22:05,976
Speaker 1: You know, you see a lot of other brand, you know, it is just.

299
00:22:06,579 --> 00:22:30,320
Speaker 1: you know I don't know what if they're actually doing anything right, you know in terms of like, you know Money or anything like that, but it's like just to see a brand, you know Not just put up some rainbow flag in June, right but to be always seemingly always frequently Right actively like leaning into it hard right and not just being like, you know making some corporate.

300
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:38,687
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, it's a. it's a take that for all the problems of rainbow capitalism a not a benefit of it But a a thing to note about it.

301
00:22:38,807 --> 00:22:54,500
Speaker 0: Is that rainbow capitalism type things happen more When the people making decisions with money decide that that is the majority of people they're going to make money off of themselves And it often can represent a sea change in the general sentiment of a population.

302
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:55,561
Speaker 1: Hmm.

303
00:22:56,003 --> 00:23:00,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just I'm really even though I'd you know, how much do I care about Popeye?

304
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:13,570
Speaker 0: I care quite a bit because the one thing a lot of people like look at this account I'll say this most people have this idea of what Popeye is but never actually read Any of the old Popeye comics or saw the old pop air cartoons?

305
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:17,204
Speaker 0: They are fucked up weird shit They are.

306
00:23:17,426 --> 00:23:22,249
Speaker 1: they are so weird You have no one of those things are like I saw.

307
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,636
Speaker 1: I probably saw mostly pop old pop.

308
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:28,224
Speaker 0: Oh, I saw like the old radically Spare.

309
00:23:28,264 --> 00:23:28,446
Speaker 1: yeah.

310
00:23:28,567 --> 00:23:29,434
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have seen them.

311
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:31,828
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I thought a lot I was because they weren't on.

312
00:23:31,989 --> 00:23:38,579
Speaker 0: they weren't on TV with any regular Film reels of Popeye cartoons that we would bust out and watch.

313
00:23:39,443 --> 00:23:43,672
Speaker 1: Okay, we didn't have those The Popeye actual comics.

314
00:23:43,853 --> 00:23:47,600
Speaker 1: I you know, I saw them once in a while But it's like I could have bought a whole book of them.

315
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,274
Speaker 1: But you know you still can but I just never did because I didn't.

316
00:23:50,777 --> 00:23:57,120
Speaker 1: yeah It wasn't a high priority like oh, let me buy all the Popeye collection, but I busted a Tracy collection instead.

317
00:23:57,281 --> 00:24:00,978
Speaker 0: Yeah, all I'll say is if you never read old Popeye you're in for a ride.

318
00:24:01,661 --> 00:24:04,794
Speaker 0: It's there is no way it's even close to what you think it's like.

319
00:24:05,457 --> 00:24:11,515
Speaker 0: and you know If you've never seen the live-action Popeye movie with Robin Willie, I have not.

320
00:24:11,735 --> 00:24:13,320
Speaker 1: I didn't even know there was such a thing.

321
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,343
Speaker 0: right, I can't.

322
00:24:14,363 --> 00:24:24,795
Speaker 0: but the live-action Popeye movie is orthogonally adjacent To the live-action Dick Tracy movie in that it is a fucking set piece.

323
00:24:25,337 --> 00:24:38,962
Speaker 0: They made that Popeye true to the car to the old comic Popeye probably to a degree that was unhealthy and unwise and Robin Williams basically just ate the mic and swallowed it.

324
00:24:39,243 --> 00:24:40,206
Speaker 0: He ate the camera.

325
00:24:40,407 --> 00:24:41,290
Speaker 0: He ate the scenery.

326
00:24:41,671 --> 00:24:43,799
Speaker 0: He threw himself into that role to a degree.

327
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,490
Speaker 0: That was almost too much even for Robin Williams.

328
00:24:47,631 --> 00:24:50,670
Speaker 0: Okay, then that movie I would say is a triumph.

329
00:24:51,171 --> 00:24:54,541
Speaker 0: But I also am not going to necessarily say that it is good.

330
00:24:54,561 --> 00:24:57,008
Speaker 1: I don't think it's as good as Pan's Labyrinth.

331
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:01,914
Speaker 0: Ah No, it is not as good as Pan's Labyrinth But it is.

332
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:05,288
Speaker 0: it is something and I'm just gonna leave it at that.

333
00:25:08,772 --> 00:25:09,736
Speaker 0: I kind of want to watch it again.

334
00:25:09,756 --> 00:25:10,559
Speaker 0: It's been decades.

335
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:13,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, follow follow the official Popeye account on Twitter.

336
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:14,416
Speaker 1: It's it's it's worth it.

337
00:25:14,516 --> 00:25:16,768
Speaker 1: Even if you don't give a lot of craps about Popeye.

338
00:25:22,724 --> 00:25:25,825
Speaker 0: but anyway things Of the day.

339
00:25:25,926 --> 00:25:29,500
Speaker 0: so uh Scott you familiar with the epic of Gilgamesh?

340
00:25:31,222 --> 00:25:33,857
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's you know, I've played Gilgamesh.

341
00:25:33,877 --> 00:25:46,294
Speaker 0: the game is So, uh, if you if any of you out there have never read or like don't know a lot about the epic of Gilgamesh it's one of the oldest like things humans have made.

342
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:53,713
Speaker 0: that is a narrative and This is like Early early civilization that still exists that we still have.

343
00:25:53,773 --> 00:25:57,522
Speaker 1: Yes that we know that we can still read Survive.

344
00:25:57,562 --> 00:26:00,370
Speaker 0: this is like this is a Babylonian poem.

345
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:10,300
Speaker 0: Like we're talking thousands of years before Homer so Thousands of years before the Odyssey thousands of years now.

346
00:26:10,866 --> 00:26:11,960
Speaker 0: It might be older.

347
00:26:12,141 --> 00:26:17,720
Speaker 0: It might be older in the time the Odyssey of written was written and perfoil written performed.

348
00:26:18,362 --> 00:26:21,210
Speaker 0: then the Odyssey is to us today like.

349
00:26:21,271 --> 00:26:24,039
Speaker 0: that is the sense of scale you need to internalize.

350
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:30,800
Speaker 0: and One thing about it is that it is about the concept of how did animals become human?

351
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:48,279
Speaker 0: And the answer spoilers is through urban living like it really like the narrative of this story if you have never read it is basically that humans didn't become human until they lived in cities and Like lived in an urban environment and people who did not live in urban environments were not yet fully human.

352
00:26:50,022 --> 00:26:50,704
Speaker 0: And that is up.

353
00:26:51,085 --> 00:26:53,313
Speaker 0: That is a take for so partially true.

354
00:26:53,735 --> 00:27:01,599
Speaker 0: Yeah in a lot of ways I mean, I live in New York City and it's pretty dire out there outside of these borders But I digress.

355
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:15,340
Speaker 0: so but one thing that happens in the epic of Gilgamesh got it right is that Shamat sends Goes out to find Anki do who is a human who is not yet human.

356
00:27:15,442 --> 00:27:21,636
Speaker 0: It is a in human form But he acts and lives like an animal and he is very powerful and very wise as an animal.

357
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:26,859
Speaker 0: and the whole story is about He becomes human and becomes friends with Gilgamesh, but Anki do.

358
00:27:27,844 --> 00:27:38,339
Speaker 0: There's a pivotal pivotal scene that gets talked about a lot especially when like high school kids read Gilgamesh where he has sex with her for a week and That is a scene like that.

359
00:27:38,821 --> 00:28:02,596
Speaker 0: So we always knew that that scene was written in one way and it was written slightly Differently in an updated version of the epic like hundreds or maybe even a thousand years later Recent like very recent evidence that is pretty rock-solid like clay tablets that are all confirmed Have shown us that that is not two different versions of that sex scene.

360
00:28:03,057 --> 00:28:09,298
Speaker 0: There are two Different week-long sex orgies that happen in the tail of Gilgamesh one.

361
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,904
Speaker 1: Well, you know there was.

362
00:28:11,025 --> 00:28:14,600
Speaker 1: there was a lot of anime to watch in those thousands of years ago, right?

363
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,613
Speaker 1: So that was pretty much the only entertainment you had.

364
00:28:17,137 --> 00:28:20,970
Speaker 0: Yeah Kind of like how kids read Shakespeare and think it's dry.

365
00:28:21,311 --> 00:28:23,417
Speaker 0: But if you see Shakespeare perform.

366
00:28:23,457 --> 00:28:29,800
Speaker 0: Well, you're like, oh It's a bunch of sex jokes and fart jokes, oh I get it.

367
00:28:30,202 --> 00:28:33,198
Speaker 0: I was supposed to cheer and yell and interrupt them during this scene.

368
00:28:34,821 --> 00:28:35,826
Speaker 0: So yeah Gilgamesh.

369
00:28:36,268 --> 00:28:45,378
Speaker 0: two separate week-long sex orgies Confirmed and this article does a really good job of framing how they figured this out and why it matters and why.

370
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:46,343
Speaker 0: living in New York Is great.

371
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,156
Speaker 0: So what do you got way to go?

372
00:28:48,197 --> 00:28:48,640
Speaker 1: Go to Gomesh.

373
00:28:49,881 --> 00:28:56,940
Speaker 1: So way back in the in the elementary school times right all the computers in school were mostly Apple twos.

374
00:28:57,181 --> 00:29:00,417
Speaker 1: Maybe a Mac was towards the late elementary school time.

375
00:29:00,437 --> 00:29:07,800
Speaker 1: Yeah And all the printers we had were mostly like, you know Apple the the dot matrix ones, right?

376
00:29:10,122 --> 00:29:14,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, they were the ones that could print on unlimited length pages with the little tear-offs usually.

377
00:29:15,252 --> 00:29:18,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly Technology came a long way while we were young.

378
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:23,460
Speaker 1: So if you wanted to print something well, you could open up a word processing program type text and print it out.

379
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,269
Speaker 1: Right, but maybe you wanted to print something that wasn't just text.

380
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:30,578
Speaker 1: Well, it's the JPEG and the gift did not exist yet.

381
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:33,945
Speaker 1: So You wanted to print something else?

382
00:29:34,466 --> 00:29:39,240
Speaker 1: It's not like, you know, you could like draw something on your screen like with InDesign.

383
00:29:40,621 --> 00:29:55,864
Speaker 1: So there was a program that was extremely popular in our school and I assume every other school and anyone else who had an Apple to computer called the print shop, right and Basically, you would open up this program and you could choose, you know Like you want to put.

384
00:29:55,884 --> 00:29:58,780
Speaker 1: you want to print a big banner a greeting card, right?

385
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:04,266
Speaker 1: It's like there were choices of things you wanted to print out and then you would you know Fill in sort of these templates like it's like.

386
00:30:04,306 --> 00:30:32,260
Speaker 1: okay choose one of the pictures the cake the bear, you know You know you got choices, right and You could change the banner the the borders if you wanted to and you could change the colors Depending on what inks your printer had, you know, and you could type some text and you know Yeah, a lot of there was a lot of you know, creative flexibility you have with this little program and then you would push print and One thing you could do that even computers today really can't do very well because it was dot matrix.

387
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:34,417
Speaker 1: It could just print something fucking long.

388
00:30:35,242 --> 00:30:40,420
Speaker 1: You know print very often these really long banners that would say like happy birthday so-and-so.

389
00:30:41,402 --> 00:30:46,596
Speaker 0: You know every elementary school has like the incident that gets talked about during like a particular time period.

390
00:30:47,017 --> 00:30:48,060
Speaker 1: you printed something long.

391
00:30:48,241 --> 00:30:53,840
Speaker 0: I didn't do it, but the incident was basically who printed the big dick?

392
00:30:55,362 --> 00:31:04,280
Speaker 0: It came out of the printer one day and nobody would take no one would take the fall And we know whatever figured out who did it and that was like the incident.

393
00:31:04,381 --> 00:31:13,058
Speaker 1: Yeah, I want to say this was second or third grade Yeah, but yeah, so this program, you know, there's like nothing else that prints things like this program does right?

394
00:31:13,078 --> 00:31:17,053
Speaker 1: It's a very Particular aesthetic and these particular designs.

395
00:31:17,134 --> 00:31:18,400
Speaker 1: you really can't replicate them.

396
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:27,194
Speaker 1: But somebody took the old Apple program and they emulated it obviously not difficult at all And they stuck it in a web browser again not difficult at all.

397
00:31:27,274 --> 00:31:28,760
Speaker 1: archive org has a huge archive.

398
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,624
Speaker 1: I'm sure that probably includes this program Emulated.

399
00:31:32,066 --> 00:31:41,018
Speaker 1: but on this website the print shop club They have modified slash hooked into this emulated ROM of this application.

400
00:31:41,218 --> 00:31:44,416
Speaker 0: Oh shit I thought you're thinking today was just this web page working.

401
00:31:44,497 --> 00:31:45,060
Speaker 0: Not that bad.

402
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:50,460
Speaker 1: I didn't even notice that bit in such a way because just emulating an old Apple to program is no big deal.

403
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,766
Speaker 1: Right every single right.

404
00:31:52,108 --> 00:31:54,619
Speaker 1: they have emulated it and modified it in such a way.

405
00:31:55,101 --> 00:32:00,120
Speaker 1: Then it comes time to print with this Apple to program in your web browser.

406
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,164
Speaker 1: That's zero dollars.

407
00:32:01,525 --> 00:32:02,369
Speaker 1: At least nowadays.

408
00:32:02,389 --> 00:32:03,132
Speaker 1: It's zero dollars.

409
00:32:03,694 --> 00:32:05,140
Speaker 1: It will create for you a PDF.

410
00:32:06,321 --> 00:32:07,625
Speaker 1: So then you can.

411
00:32:07,685 --> 00:32:17,976
Speaker 1: I guess you still can't print something long because you have a dot matrix printer, but any of the one pagers Long if you send it to the right kind of print shop and a PDF.

412
00:32:18,037 --> 00:32:28,960
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah you send your send your long multi page PDF to the right place and they'll print you something long, but Now you can print a print shop greeting card for whoever on there.

413
00:32:29,201 --> 00:32:31,568
Speaker 1: You know birthday anniversary, whatever.

414
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:35,240
Speaker 0: So our friend red's birthday will happen during our beach trip.

415
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:37,812
Speaker 0: I uh, I think we should all make out a little.

416
00:32:37,832 --> 00:32:39,379
Speaker 0: I think we should make some greeting cards.

417
00:32:41,306 --> 00:32:42,214
Speaker 0: Okay, I got some ideas.

418
00:32:42,315 --> 00:32:42,820
Speaker 0: I'm feeling this.

419
00:32:43,941 --> 00:32:45,450
Speaker 1: You can't get a Pokemon into this thing.

420
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:51,424
Speaker 0: No, I'll have to draw one badly In the meta moment.

421
00:32:51,866 --> 00:32:53,652
Speaker 0: the geek nice book club book the tale of Genji.

422
00:32:53,954 --> 00:32:58,620
Speaker 0: as Genji continues to sleepwalk through life I feel like by the end of summer we'll be ready to talk about this on the show.

423
00:32:59,383 --> 00:33:07,272
Speaker 1: While it is the first novel ever written by any human ever It is not even close to being as old as the tale of Gilgamesh.

424
00:33:07,332 --> 00:33:09,800
Speaker 0: Nope, but tale of Gilgamesh is a saga.

425
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:11,407
Speaker 1: It is indeed.

426
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:19,197
Speaker 1: It is not a novel and that is why The tale of Genji is still the first novel ever written by human beings that we are aware of.

427
00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:26,202
Speaker 0: Genji It's just like I say this every time but though as I keep reading He just sleepwalks through life Like he's like.

428
00:33:26,222 --> 00:33:31,580
Speaker 0: he's almost like a Captain Tyler figure except he never seems to have a moment where he does something that matters.

429
00:33:33,561 --> 00:33:33,943
Speaker 0: We'll see how.

430
00:33:33,963 --> 00:33:38,689
Speaker 0: it'll see how it keeps going but uh, I got some thoughts on it so far But it's enjoyable.

431
00:33:39,012 --> 00:33:50,479
Speaker 0: my advice to you though If you're gonna start reading it with us now that we're reading it a pretty steady pace Don't fuss over fiddly little details to figure out exactly what happened If you're like a little vague on how who said what or like who someone was.

432
00:33:50,981 --> 00:33:56,860
Speaker 0: Just unless you're trying to become a scholar of Genji just keep trucking read it like you'd read a dime store romance novel.

433
00:33:57,686 --> 00:33:59,096
Speaker 0: Yep, like that's the way to go.

434
00:34:00,342 --> 00:34:00,964
Speaker 0: In some other news.

435
00:34:01,084 --> 00:34:07,100
Speaker 0: We just did a panel a new one at the penny arcade Expo online East called Atari game design.

436
00:34:07,341 --> 00:34:08,063
Speaker 0: It live stream.

437
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:09,088
Speaker 0: a lot of people watched.

438
00:34:09,128 --> 00:34:10,072
Speaker 0: it was very well received.

439
00:34:10,554 --> 00:34:12,120
Speaker 0: The entirety of it is now on YouTube.

440
00:34:12,463 --> 00:34:13,251
Speaker 0: You can just watch it.

441
00:34:13,494 --> 00:34:13,978
Speaker 0: It's live.

442
00:34:15,802 --> 00:34:16,925
Speaker 0: Then yep, it's up there.

443
00:34:17,226 --> 00:34:17,607
Speaker 0: check it out.

444
00:34:17,627 --> 00:34:18,570
Speaker 0: It's pretty good.

445
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:35,358
Speaker 1: I have in a somewhat also news I have Mostly finished at least 1.0 finished right even though I then immediately filed a bunch of issues against myself The tool That will form the foundation of the new geek nice website.

446
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:38,279
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna be making like a little video.

447
00:34:38,966 --> 00:34:40,179
Speaker 1: It's already on github and whatnot.

448
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:52,358
Speaker 1: But I'm gonna make a little demo video Said if you want to make a website You'll be able to see how to use this tool to get Basically a whole bunch of shit done in like a matter of minutes and then start making your website.

449
00:34:52,378 --> 00:35:04,400
Speaker 1: So Now that this exists it took me a long time to make it I can use it and be able to develop Geek nights website and make changes to it very very quickly and rapidly.

450
00:35:05,161 --> 00:35:10,792
Speaker 1: So that's all gonna be rolling Really when it's not nice out anymore, yeah, which is fine.

451
00:35:10,852 --> 00:35:13,000
Speaker 0: cuz like I there's a bunch of projects.

452
00:35:13,341 --> 00:35:18,940
Speaker 0: I have a project around taking every main bit of every geek nuts episode ever and pulling it out into a standalone thing.

453
00:35:19,362 --> 00:35:22,020
Speaker 0: Cuz people might want our review of like an anime.

454
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:32,182
Speaker 0: For that we did in like 2007 and don't need 30 minutes of us talking about Bikes or the pub crawl outside or whatever the hell was going on at Beacon at the time Yep.

455
00:35:32,805 --> 00:35:40,600
Speaker 1: So yeah, it's if you're if you want to make a program a website And there isn't an existing web application that does what you want to do.

456
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,227
Speaker 1: Like you don't make a blog just use WordPress.

457
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:43,673
Speaker 1: if you want to make e-commerce.

458
00:35:43,693 --> 00:35:44,477
Speaker 1: There's a lot of choices.

459
00:35:44,537 --> 00:35:54,168
Speaker 1: Yep Like I hiccup suddenly, but if you want to make something like this I want to make a website that does not exist, you know There isn't a software that does the website you want to do.

460
00:35:54,710 --> 00:36:01,086
Speaker 1: You may want to consider using the thing that I just made YouTube and whatnot.

461
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:07,836
Speaker 0: geek nights will finally at some point one Incorporate our new branding into like our website which still has our old brand.

462
00:36:07,856 --> 00:36:08,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what's gonna happen.

463
00:36:09,081 --> 00:36:10,264
Speaker 1: Oh, I should probably mention the thing.

464
00:36:10,304 --> 00:36:13,412
Speaker 1: I'm the tool I made is called Django.

465
00:36:13,432 --> 00:36:19,351
Speaker 1: go boot because it helps you boot up Django better than the regular template thing that they give you.

466
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:21,036
Speaker 1: use the default Django start project.

467
00:36:21,056 --> 00:36:22,080
Speaker 1: that doesn't get you anywhere.

468
00:36:22,351 --> 00:36:24,045
Speaker 1: Yeah this the thing I made.

469
00:36:24,306 --> 00:36:31,009
Speaker 1: gets you the template and the repository and the CI CD stack and Launches your production server as soon as you make a release.

470
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,720
Speaker 1: all it does almost everything for you know to do anything.

471
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,285
Speaker 0: It's good stuff.

472
00:36:34,326 --> 00:36:35,739
Speaker 1: You do it to do a tiny bit.

473
00:36:36,426 --> 00:36:37,720
Speaker 0: It also means we can start to add one.

474
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:41,474
Speaker 0: Eventually, it means some things we wanted to add to our website.

475
00:36:41,494 --> 00:36:43,160
Speaker 0: We'll be able to appear on our website.

476
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:51,000
Speaker 0: Yep, we have pointedly avoiding like avoided putting new types of things on the website because that would have meant fucking with the old website.

477
00:36:53,182 --> 00:36:56,393
Speaker 0: All right, so, uh, let's dive right into it.

478
00:36:56,855 --> 00:37:04,383
Speaker 0: Hannah Barbara cartoons Uh, uh, we're not covering like the history of Hannah Barbara cuz they You can go

479
00:37:04,524 --> 00:37:19,358
Speaker 1: online you can go on YouTube you can go on anywhere and there are people who are like scholars of this shit and they know all the fucking details of how everything went down and we don't know any of that and even If we researched it, we couldn't why bother repeating what someone else who knows more already said.

480
00:37:19,479 --> 00:37:25,007
Speaker 1: so We're just gonna focus on hey our Experience with these things.

481
00:37:25,087 --> 00:37:26,834
Speaker 0: Yeah, like cuz we watched a lot.

482
00:37:26,874 --> 00:37:32,440
Speaker 0: both of us watch a lot of Hannah Barbara cartoons, even if we didn't realize they were Hannah Barbara for much of our lives.

483
00:37:33,082 --> 00:37:35,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, so for for those who are unaware, right?

484
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:38,020
Speaker 1: Maybe not from the US or not have younger, right?

485
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:41,498
Speaker 1: In the United States, right cartoons have been around a long time.

486
00:37:42,161 --> 00:37:43,426
Speaker 1: Anime, you know that you had your Disney's.

487
00:37:43,627 --> 00:37:47,300
Speaker 1: you had your Warner Brothers is right flesh your brother putting out, right?

488
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:53,260
Speaker 1: They were putting out these really high quality animations, you know in theaters playing before movies, right?

489
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, you watch a Bugs Bunny from like, you know the 40s or whatever looks incredible, right?

490
00:37:58,886 --> 00:38:03,227
Speaker 1: and then once Television came around, you know six mostly.

491
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:05,894
Speaker 1: we're talking 60s 60s 70s 80s and then fading out 90s, right?

492
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:14,464
Speaker 1: in those times You Need TV animation.

493
00:38:14,585 --> 00:38:16,632
Speaker 1: so they did replay the movie.

494
00:38:16,913 --> 00:38:18,840
Speaker 1: quality animations on television, right?

495
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:23,355
Speaker 1: I saw a lot of Warner Brothers on TV, but you needed something to go on TV.

496
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:24,800
Speaker 1: That was cheaper, right?

497
00:38:26,167 --> 00:38:28,139
Speaker 1: less to produce Yeah.

498
00:38:29,383 --> 00:38:45,116
Speaker 1: And so in the United States the Hannah Barbara production studio, I had a large hand in producing Lots and lots and lots of television animation from the city, you know especially 60 70s 80s and then fading out in the 90s

499
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:50,956
Speaker 0: people who made like 1957 the people who made Tom and Jerry and a bunch of people who used to work at him.

500
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,490
Speaker 1: Tom and Jerry was like MGM Right.

501
00:38:52,531 --> 00:39:08,480
Speaker 0: Yes So basically a bunch of people who were working in and around MGM got together to make This and there and then the two people who drove it all and like founded the studio Were named Hannah and Barbara William Hannah and Joseph Barbara.

502
00:39:09,122 --> 00:39:14,704
Speaker 1: So the you know, the shows often feature much lower quality Animation right?

503
00:39:14,724 --> 00:39:16,610
Speaker 1: You'd be like wow, this is newer than that.

504
00:39:16,811 --> 00:39:19,500
Speaker 1: then like Snow White Snow White looks a hundred times better than this.

505
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,184
Speaker 1: It's like yeah well snow yeah kind of.

506
00:39:21,204 --> 00:39:37,277
Speaker 0: when I was long and a Barbara cartoons actually messed with my like in like my perceived chronology of animation because I assumed as a kid like when I was really young at a pre-internet era that Like Yogi Bear was ancient compared to all these Disney things.

507
00:39:37,318 --> 00:39:39,365
Speaker 0: I was watching Yeah, it was.

508
00:39:39,425 --> 00:39:41,960
Speaker 1: but you know, the thing is you had to make how many episodes of Yogi Bear?

509
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,133
Speaker 1: You only had to make 90 minutes.

510
00:39:43,174 --> 00:39:43,599
Speaker 1: snow white snow.

511
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,630
Speaker 1: I had more money and was on a movie theater.

512
00:39:45,771 --> 00:39:47,037
Speaker 1: right the Yogi Bear didn't make as much.

513
00:39:47,078 --> 00:39:47,500
Speaker 1: I was a kid.

514
00:39:47,601 --> 00:39:48,391
Speaker 0: There was no internet.

515
00:39:48,432 --> 00:39:48,918
Speaker 0: I didn't know.

516
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:56,309
Speaker 1: All right, so Hannah Barbara the other thing that really you know Stood out about them was just they were.

517
00:39:56,329 --> 00:39:58,760
Speaker 1: they were definitely a quantity shop, right?

518
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:11,500
Speaker 1: Just throwing shit against the wall, right seeing what stuck when things stuck They made lots and lots of episodes of that thing Right and worked harder at it and did a better job on it and when things didn't stick they would end quickly.

519
00:40:11,681 --> 00:40:15,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot of shows they made that had a very small number of episodes.

520
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:21,118
Speaker 0: I would never got replayed anywhere ever even just looking at the stuff from like the 60s and 70s.

521
00:40:22,242 --> 00:40:30,472
Speaker 1: I only recognize like 10% of these shows Because a lot of things like we're throwing shit at the wall They didn't stick and they weren't popular.

522
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:31,680
Speaker 1: and then just like alright enough of that.

523
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:37,260
Speaker 0: Let's move, you know Like I got I got to talk about this this Roman holidays thing because I found it on this list.

524
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,048
Speaker 0: They they only made 13 episodes.

525
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:48,560
Speaker 0: So the Flintstones, you know thing they made Super popular like that was a that was like that is still a touchstone of American pop culture the Flintstones.

526
00:40:49,600 --> 00:41:00,320
Speaker 0: So they were trying to remember it was trying to recreate the success of the Flintstones by having another show With a modern ish family living in a heavy heavily fictionalized ancient time.

527
00:41:00,823 --> 00:41:03,600
Speaker 0: So they made a show called the Roman holidays.

528
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:10,097
Speaker 0: Basically the Flintstones but set during ancient Rome from the Jetsons is just Flintstones in the future.

529
00:41:10,117 --> 00:41:10,518
Speaker 1: Yep.

530
00:41:10,538 --> 00:41:11,240
Speaker 0: There's even a movie.

531
00:41:13,562 --> 00:41:17,276
Speaker 0: So, uh, they made this show with characters like mr.

532
00:41:17,376 --> 00:41:19,863
Speaker 0: Evictus and Mr.

533
00:41:19,943 --> 00:41:24,080
Speaker 0: Tycoonius and it looks like it was just awful that failed instantly.

534
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:27,719
Speaker 0: But also they have fucking Dom DeLuise to voice a bunch of the characters.

535
00:41:28,521 --> 00:41:30,713
Speaker 1: Well, how big of a deal was Dom DeLuise at that time?

536
00:41:30,935 --> 00:41:31,900
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah at that time.

537
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:32,361
Speaker 0: So, let's see.

538
00:41:32,401 --> 00:41:34,889
Speaker 0: This was miss early seven.

539
00:41:34,929 --> 00:41:36,373
Speaker 1: my he might have been a big deal already.

540
00:41:36,413 --> 00:41:36,774
Speaker 1: I don't know.

541
00:41:36,895 --> 00:41:37,717
Speaker 0: this was early 70s.

542
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:43,075
Speaker 0: So he had not yet done all those Mel Brooks movies.

543
00:41:43,457 --> 00:41:46,366
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Not a big deal yet.

544
00:41:46,427 --> 00:41:50,400
Speaker 0: I didn't realize he didn't become a big deal until the basically right after that.

545
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,316
Speaker 0: That was like the last not big deal thing.

546
00:41:52,357 --> 00:41:59,132
Speaker 1: He did Well, so we We did a whole episode on Scooby-doo alone.

547
00:41:59,212 --> 00:42:00,917
Speaker 1: So let us not speak of Scooby-doo.

548
00:42:00,957 --> 00:42:02,180
Speaker 1: Let us speak of everything else.

549
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:06,057
Speaker 0: So I. the one thing I got to say first is those shows that I wrote like as a kid.

550
00:42:06,077 --> 00:42:14,120
Speaker 0: I Recognized a lot of things that I thought were Hannah Barbara and I was right and I always had this perception as a kid That they were bad.

551
00:42:14,921 --> 00:42:18,373
Speaker 0: But I still watched them, but I didn't like watching them.

552
00:42:18,875 --> 00:42:19,296
Speaker 0: Like it was.

553
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:21,904
Speaker 1: this weird situation Depends on which one.

554
00:42:21,944 --> 00:42:28,348
Speaker 0: like Yogi Bear I never liked but I watched it a lot on TV for some reason I just never liked ever here.

555
00:42:28,408 --> 00:42:28,870
Speaker 1: I just didn't.

556
00:42:29,191 --> 00:42:30,637
Speaker 1: I just didn't really like.

557
00:42:30,697 --> 00:42:31,540
Speaker 0: I didn't like it at all.

558
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,031
Speaker 0: I don't know why I watched it like.

559
00:42:33,071 --> 00:42:36,405
Speaker 0: it just seemed so Plotting and insipid and like.

560
00:42:36,425 --> 00:42:39,898
Speaker 0: the jokes weren't funny and it was like the same fucking joke every time.

561
00:42:39,938 --> 00:42:41,905
Speaker 1: but somehow It was the same joke every time.

562
00:42:41,946 --> 00:42:45,400
Speaker 0: that's it was just on TV and I would just sit there watching it.

563
00:42:46,321 --> 00:42:50,696
Speaker 0: But some of the shows I would actively watch and enjoy like I particularly as a kid.

564
00:42:51,017 --> 00:42:56,860
Speaker 0: I like the Flintstones I like the Jetsons, uh, I didn't actually like Johnny Quest, but all of my friends liked it.

565
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,307
Speaker 0: I just didn't think I did not like.

566
00:42:58,347 --> 00:43:04,735
Speaker 1: Johnny Quest was a weird one in that if you saw The aesthetic of Johnny Quest what Johnny Quest is supposed to be right?

567
00:43:04,796 --> 00:43:06,522
Speaker 1: I looked at it and I'm like That's the thing.

568
00:43:06,582 --> 00:43:07,926
Speaker 1: I should like that aesthetically.

569
00:43:07,946 --> 00:43:08,929
Speaker 1: That's amazing, right?

570
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:11,858
Speaker 1: It's like but actually watching Johnny Quest.

571
00:43:11,918 --> 00:43:12,680
Speaker 1: I never enjoyed it.

572
00:43:13,182 --> 00:43:13,563
Speaker 1: So I never.

573
00:43:13,744 --> 00:43:14,467
Speaker 1: I never watched it.

574
00:43:14,507 --> 00:43:18,522
Speaker 1: that much interesting because like one of my favorite looks like a thing I should like.

575
00:43:18,602 --> 00:43:19,565
Speaker 1: but no actually I don't.

576
00:43:19,665 --> 00:43:24,780
Speaker 0: one of my favorite animated shows in history including anime is actually the venture brothers.

577
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:25,282
Speaker 0: I think it's.

578
00:43:25,442 --> 00:43:26,065
Speaker 0: it's a like.

579
00:43:26,105 --> 00:43:30,240
Speaker 0: it is a phenomenal and unique show which is primarily a Johnny Quest pair.

580
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:35,110
Speaker 0: It started as a Johnny Quest parody like straight up But then it you know it it did.

581
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:40,560
Speaker 0: I know this is a word that people misuse a lot But I mean this directly specifically and I'm choosing this word carefully.

582
00:43:41,422 --> 00:43:51,257
Speaker 0: It evolved into a deconstruction of shows like Johnny Quest and then it went way beyond that into being like a post Johnny Quest thing and they just kept it going.

583
00:43:51,318 --> 00:43:52,384
Speaker 0: somehow They kept it going.

584
00:43:52,404 --> 00:43:55,098
Speaker 1: all they had to do and then they just died will change course.

585
00:43:55,139 --> 00:43:58,090
Speaker 0: now I did enjoy some of the like.

586
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:11,032
Speaker 0: they made a lot of shows that I would see like once and then never see again and every able to fight again like a lot of cartoon adaptations of Real things like they made some Three Stooges like one-offs.

587
00:44:11,052 --> 00:44:13,800
Speaker 0: They made some Laurel and Hardy one-offs sure.

588
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:17,580
Speaker 1: Well, cuz most of these things right aired before we were even alive.

589
00:44:17,901 --> 00:44:25,469
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we all and on broadcast television if there's a Saturday morning cartoon, you know, for example I don't know.

590
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:27,019
Speaker 1: Let's see again.

591
00:44:29,121 --> 00:44:30,731
Speaker 1: This is let's see, it's fine.

592
00:44:30,851 --> 00:44:32,320
Speaker 1: Oh, here's a good example, right?

593
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,431
Speaker 1: So there was a show called fantastic max.

594
00:44:34,491 --> 00:44:35,416
Speaker 1: apparently it had 26 episodes.

595
00:44:36,542 --> 00:44:43,899
Speaker 1: I saw that when I was a kid because it was actually on like daily on syndicated on a particular channel at a particular time.

596
00:44:44,622 --> 00:44:50,440
Speaker 0: I've never heard of or seen fantastic max nor do I recognize it from looking at images?

597
00:44:51,222 --> 00:44:54,220
Speaker 1: It's actually a really sort of imaginative show.

598
00:44:54,501 --> 00:44:58,915
Speaker 1: I want to say it's almost like Muppets babies and she's really never heard of this.

599
00:44:59,035 --> 00:45:00,540
Speaker 0: This does not exist in my universe.

600
00:45:00,963 --> 00:45:07,653
Speaker 1: It's like this kid is like he's a baby in a crib Right named max and he's got like a friend robot and shit, but he's like.

601
00:45:08,054 --> 00:45:09,980
Speaker 1: then he's going off on like space adventures.

602
00:45:10,121 --> 00:45:12,393
Speaker 1: But actually it was just his imagination or something.

603
00:45:12,453 --> 00:45:20,039
Speaker 0: along those more images I see from the show the less I recognize that I've definitely never encountered bad to this show in my life until just now.

604
00:45:21,115 --> 00:45:25,612
Speaker 1: But yeah I watched like many episodes of that show because it happened to be on right.

605
00:45:26,013 --> 00:45:35,320
Speaker 1: a show I liked a lot better than that Was captain caveman who I thought was funny hitting things with his club and that was basically almost never on right.

606
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:35,641
Speaker 1: It's like.

607
00:45:35,701 --> 00:45:40,657
Speaker 1: I'd be lucky if I think it was hated captain caveman and I'll admit I also.

608
00:45:40,958 --> 00:45:43,563
Speaker 0: I also hated Hence on scrappy.

609
00:45:43,603 --> 00:45:46,610
Speaker 0: do I also hated wacky races to be honest?

610
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,704
Speaker 1: Wacky races.

611
00:45:48,724 --> 00:45:50,352
Speaker 0: There's there's my problem with wacky races.

612
00:45:50,834 --> 00:45:54,860
Speaker 0: when I encountered it The concept was like perfect.

613
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,126
Speaker 0: I just pump it into my veins.

614
00:45:56,488 --> 00:45:58,116
Speaker 0: get all these cartoon characters of all these things.

615
00:45:58,357 --> 00:45:58,960
Speaker 0: do it right like that.

616
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:05,258
Speaker 0: I was so into that concept, but every single episode I watched was the antithesis of humor.

617
00:46:07,742 --> 00:46:08,827
Speaker 1: Like he's just monthly going.

618
00:46:09,429 --> 00:46:10,132
Speaker 0: yeah like that.

619
00:46:10,153 --> 00:46:15,699
Speaker 0: I like that but he has to go In a context that is novel and funny at some point.

620
00:46:16,885 --> 00:46:17,453
Speaker 1: No such thing.

621
00:46:17,656 --> 00:46:20,247
Speaker 0: No Like wacky race, you know, it's funny.

622
00:46:20,287 --> 00:46:23,219
Speaker 0: The wacky races are heavily parodied in venture brothers as well.

623
00:46:24,124 --> 00:46:26,064
Speaker 1: Okay, sure But yeah, it's like.

624
00:46:26,225 --> 00:46:28,535
Speaker 1: you know you is pretty much just like what.

625
00:46:28,656 --> 00:46:29,440
Speaker 1: when were you born?

626
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:35,480
Speaker 1: When were you home watching TV, right and you know, obviously the big shows the ones that had tons of episodes.

627
00:46:35,921 --> 00:46:37,285
Speaker 1: It's like I don't know.

628
00:46:37,366 --> 00:46:38,950
Speaker 1: I may have seen every Jetsons.

629
00:46:39,011 --> 00:46:39,733
Speaker 1: It's possible.

630
00:46:39,793 --> 00:46:42,120
Speaker 1: But you know, this may have seen every Flintstones.

631
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:42,903
Speaker 1: I don't remember them all.

632
00:46:42,923 --> 00:46:46,194
Speaker 0: there's actually only a hundred and sixty six episodes of the Flintstones.

633
00:46:46,455 --> 00:46:47,920
Speaker 0: That's less than a Sailor Moon.

634
00:46:48,644 --> 00:46:56,638
Speaker 1: So this is something that shocked me because even as a kid I knew that the Flintstones was like an was one of the only cart like first.

635
00:46:56,879 --> 00:47:04,134
Speaker 1: only Cartoon that was like on primetime television was super popular It was a super big deal and that it was super until The Simpsons.

636
00:47:04,194 --> 00:47:05,900
Speaker 1: It was the longest running, right?

637
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:14,420
Speaker 1: So I had been under the impression when I was a kid that the Flintstones was Still running and had been raw.

638
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:21,696
Speaker 1: I was too with a lot of these shows and that And that I had seen that I was seeing new episodes.

639
00:47:21,837 --> 00:47:26,812
Speaker 1: when it was on prime It was on primetime even when in like in the 80s at certain only that but a lot.

640
00:47:26,832 --> 00:47:37,653
Speaker 1: and I was under the impression that I was seeing a New Flintstones episode and it was only today that I realized from Wikipedia that actually no he ran from nineteen sixty nine sixty six And that was at the end.

641
00:47:39,461 --> 00:47:42,318
Speaker 1: But the other why the hell was it on primetime in the 80s.

642
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,364
Speaker 1: I don't understand.

643
00:47:43,524 --> 00:47:44,891
Speaker 1: Well, what was that big a deal?

644
00:47:44,911 --> 00:47:45,514
Speaker 0: do it to that?

645
00:47:45,936 --> 00:47:46,640
Speaker 0: a lot of these shows.

646
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:54,579
Speaker 0: they wouldn't even air early episodes of them because sometimes they were in black and white or They like didn't fit the style of the time.

647
00:47:54,884 --> 00:47:55,578
Speaker 1: There's a lot of release.

648
00:47:55,724 --> 00:48:10,780
Speaker 1: Yeah only a subset of the episodes were actually getting syndicated and repeated and you could you know You could sort of actually see even as a child You could sort of see like there were shifts in the show right Flintstones For example, when the alien gazoo guy shows up, right?

649
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:20,181
Speaker 1: You can definitely see there's like pre gazoo Flintstones and post gazoo Flintstones and you can even as a kid I understood like ah, they're trying to you know, get the show like revitalized like I would

650
00:48:20,282 --> 00:48:34,620
Speaker 0: know and for any and this happened for a lot of Hanna-Barbera cartoons an Episode would come on and between the opener and how the animation looked especially like how thick the lines were and how straight the line Was I would know ooh, this is gonna be a good one or this is gonna be a bad one.

651
00:48:35,242 --> 00:48:43,840
Speaker 0: I knew like kind of like with Tom and Jerry like you could tell oh, those are the bad Tom and Jerry's But there were definitely different sets of them, right?

652
00:48:45,341 --> 00:48:51,761
Speaker 1: There were Johnny quests then there was like new Johnny quest and then there was like there were like three different Johnny quest Serieses.

653
00:48:52,163 --> 00:48:55,760
Speaker 1: right and like only one of them was the one that was like shown much later.

654
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:02,240
Speaker 1: We probably never even seen the first two But I also the episode was different the third one and we talked about this a lot with Scooby-doo.

655
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:06,860
Speaker 0: Some of these shows I'd see even possibly the first episode onward.

656
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:14,108
Speaker 0: But because of the way pop culture talked about them and just because like there would be elements of the show I didn't understand.

657
00:49:14,148 --> 00:49:24,900
Speaker 0: as a kid for various reasons I always assumed that these shows had been running since like for decades like they just been running like I came in and Oh, the Flintstones was the only one that I thought like had been running.

658
00:49:25,222 --> 00:49:29,443
Speaker 0: I thought that about Scooby-doo and a bunch of other things too School Scooby-doo.

659
00:49:29,463 --> 00:49:34,779
Speaker 1: I understood that like the original Scooby-doo was no longer running but like pup named Scooby-doo was like the.

660
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:40,757
Speaker 0: oh No, but I just I knew that the pup named Scooby-doo was was weird like recent garbage and I only like the older ones.

661
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:42,342
Speaker 1: I Got you.

662
00:49:42,462 --> 00:49:46,357
Speaker 1: I kind of like the putt anyway, and it's well, we all agree that anything was crappy.

663
00:49:46,377 --> 00:49:47,120
Speaker 0: Do was bad news.

664
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,867
Speaker 1: So another thing is that.

665
00:49:49,967 --> 00:49:52,820
Speaker 0: but I think he raised about why did we have all these weird perceptions?

666
00:49:53,202 --> 00:49:54,006
Speaker 0: And why was it like?

667
00:49:54,268 --> 00:50:02,000
Speaker 0: I think what happened was no information available But also the anime filter kind of like how a lot of people like oh in the 90s like all the anime was great.

668
00:50:02,483 --> 00:50:05,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's more that head of our Barbera one.

669
00:50:05,481 --> 00:50:07,166
Speaker 0: they only made more episodes of shows.

670
00:50:07,206 --> 00:50:19,020
Speaker 0: that did well when they first ran and then in syndication the Stuff that was aired was basically the cream of the crop the most popular exactly proven successful things.

671
00:50:19,382 --> 00:50:27,920
Speaker 1: So we saw the distilled best that had a Barbara had to offer In order to see a bad one on TV in the broadcast days, right?

672
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:32,360
Speaker 1: You would have had to watch it on Saturday morning, right when it was a brand new show.

673
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:38,120
Speaker 1: You could only see bad stuff if it was brand new and if it didn't do well, it was gone very quickly.

674
00:50:39,043 --> 00:50:43,978
Speaker 1: It was beyond your Saturday morning cartoons for like a few weeks and then you know, maybe what 12 13 weeks, right?

675
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,360
Speaker 1: So it's a few months, right?

676
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:52,544
Speaker 1: So you had to be watching for that those few months and then the show was gone and it will never be reshown anywhere And it wasn't popular.

677
00:50:52,584 --> 00:51:04,060
Speaker 1: so they didn't make VHS tapes, right and it had to be while you were alive You know, yeah, and the other thing sometimes You would see a hand of our bear characters, right?

678
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,744
Speaker 1: You know the ones that come to mind.

679
00:51:05,784 --> 00:51:12,489
Speaker 1: for me the most in this category are like the huckleberry hound the megillah gorilla And the snagglepuss huckleberry hound.

680
00:51:12,529 --> 00:51:13,413
Speaker 0: that was the first one.

681
00:51:13,454 --> 00:51:17,119
Speaker 0: the huckleberry hound show Yogi Bear and was a spin-off.

682
00:51:17,823 --> 00:51:22,007
Speaker 1: Yeah, but those three characters in particular were characters I was completely familiar with.

683
00:51:22,047 --> 00:51:23,775
Speaker 1: if you showed me those characters as a kid.

684
00:51:23,795 --> 00:51:35,018
Speaker 1: I could tell you what their name was Yep, right and I could tell you that they were head of our rare characters But I had never seen I don't think I still have never seen an episode of huckleberry hound or snaggle.

685
00:51:35,239 --> 00:51:42,603
Speaker 0: in fact The only thing I ever saw huckleberry hound in that wasn't just like a marketing cameo Ever.

686
00:51:42,684 --> 00:51:46,217
Speaker 1: a wacky races was either wacky Yogi Yogi Bear and friends.

687
00:51:46,879 --> 00:51:50,214
Speaker 0: Uh So I hated those tired friends to the point that Yogi's Ark.

688
00:51:50,455 --> 00:51:51,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was Yogi's Ark, right?

689
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,064
Speaker 0: I forgot about Yogi's Ark.

690
00:51:53,084 --> 00:51:53,746
Speaker 0: I watched that show.

691
00:51:53,787 --> 00:51:55,152
Speaker 1: I hate lying in the bucket.

692
00:51:55,172 --> 00:51:57,039
Speaker 0: They hated that show, but I watched it for some reason.

693
00:51:58,972 --> 00:52:05,146
Speaker 0: But The good the bad and huckleberry hound is a movie I've never reason.

694
00:52:05,468 --> 00:52:08,160
Speaker 1: we saw this parody of the real movie the good bad.

695
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:16,263
Speaker 0: It is arguably a parody of the good the bad and the ugly is an animated like film Produced in 1988.

696
00:52:16,263 --> 00:52:19,273
Speaker 0: It is the second worst movie.

697
00:52:19,393 --> 00:52:23,450
Speaker 0: I have ever seen to completion in my life Literally and specifically this movie.

698
00:52:23,811 --> 00:52:25,540
Speaker 1: I didn't know it existed till today's is.

699
00:52:26,281 --> 00:52:36,784
Speaker 0: So as a kid, I first I guess we'd watch it a bunch and I thought I guess I assumed you know Cuz the way adults would react to it and I knew the good the bad and the ugly I just like.

700
00:52:36,804 --> 00:52:54,710
Speaker 0: for some reason I guess I like this movie but watching it slightly older Not only did I realize that it is one of the worst most plotting unfunny things humans have ever made But to now I realize that our parents hated this movie and hated the fact that we liked it and kept wanting to watch it.

701
00:52:56,305 --> 00:52:57,479
Speaker 0: It is so bad.

702
00:52:58,323 --> 00:53:00,430
Speaker 1: So Hannah Barbara though did make good stuff, right?

703
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:03,220
Speaker 1: So towards the end of the Hannah Barbara days, right?

704
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:06,938
Speaker 1: They were powering the sort of original Cartoon Network in the late 90s.

705
00:53:08,201 --> 00:53:09,164
Speaker 0: Girls came out of that.

706
00:53:09,525 --> 00:53:11,732
Speaker 1: girls is like technically Hannah Barbara.

707
00:53:11,752 --> 00:53:19,680
Speaker 1: still there were all these cartoon cartoons Right before Cartoon Network studios or sort of in in in league with Cartoon Network studios.

708
00:53:19,901 --> 00:53:23,299
Speaker 1: It was like a partnership and then Cartoon Network studios split off and was its own thing.

709
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,885
Speaker 1: I don't need Hannah Barbara anymore.

710
00:53:24,925 --> 00:53:27,453
Speaker 1: But you know Dexter's lab is a Hannah Barbara, right?

711
00:53:27,473 --> 00:53:29,639
Speaker 1: That's a. that's an incredible a plus all-time show.

712
00:53:30,961 --> 00:53:34,976
Speaker 1: You know those other cartoon cartoons like the Johnny Bravo cow and chicken.

713
00:53:34,996 --> 00:53:36,020
Speaker 1: It's I am weasel.

714
00:53:36,141 --> 00:53:38,599
Speaker 1: It's like well, they weren't that bad?

715
00:53:39,661 --> 00:53:40,643
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

716
00:53:41,125 --> 00:53:43,029
Speaker 1: Powerpuff Girls also legendary, right?

717
00:53:43,049 --> 00:53:46,037
Speaker 0: So they made an animated adaptation of dumb and dumber.

718
00:53:46,057 --> 00:53:47,581
Speaker 0: I Guess.

719
00:53:47,621 --> 00:53:49,650
Speaker 1: so in 1995 13 episodes, right?

720
00:53:50,434 --> 00:53:52,542
Speaker 1: There was also some other stuff They did.

721
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:56,338
Speaker 1: that was also sort of good in a way, right?

722
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:58,707
Speaker 1: So like Hercule it's right.

723
00:53:58,767 --> 00:54:08,019
Speaker 1: It's like okay that has you know It's not the greatest but it's you know, this it's kind of a cool sci-fi thing right with the with the gleep in the gloop.

724
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:12,680
Speaker 0: Well, there was there was a bill and ten cartoon that I did watch and enjoy.

725
00:54:13,761 --> 00:54:16,732
Speaker 1: Yeah, this thund are the barbarian which I love a lot.

726
00:54:16,792 --> 00:54:29,700
Speaker 1: but you know, obviously it's not that great But it's you know, there's a certain there's a thing about it right that I like You know of the old like top cat is actually if you watch a top cat It's like okay the episodes are very same II but it's actually kind of funny.

727
00:54:30,081 --> 00:54:33,051
Speaker 0: Pick an episode of top cat if you haven't seen one recently.

728
00:54:33,774 --> 00:54:35,580
Speaker 0: It's better than any Yogi Bear episode ever.

729
00:54:37,245 --> 00:54:39,389
Speaker 1: maybe You know space

730
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:44,613
Speaker 0: goes holds up Okay, but it holds up in the same way that like the honeymooners or any old because

731
00:54:44,633 --> 00:54:46,620
Speaker 1: it's a parody of the honeymooners exactly

732
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:52,959
Speaker 0: But it holds up about the same level like it's interesting that it is both parody but also entertaining enough on its

733
00:54:53,239 --> 00:54:53,300
Speaker 1: own.

734
00:54:54,284 --> 00:54:58,624
Speaker 1: Well, it's not a it's not a pair Slash it's the same fucking thing.

735
00:54:58,965 --> 00:55:00,529
Speaker 1: It's just hey, let's do the same thing.

736
00:55:00,549 --> 00:55:01,411
Speaker 0: Yeah, honeymooners.

737
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:02,955
Speaker 0: They didn't ever have an alien show up though.

738
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:07,372
Speaker 1: I Guess Mork and Mindy would be when the alien showed up.

739
00:55:07,593 --> 00:55:08,398
Speaker 0: Mork and Mindy.

740
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:08,800
Speaker 0: I'm Carrie.

741
00:55:09,122 --> 00:55:11,332
Speaker 0: I feel like young people don't even know that show existed.

742
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:13,383
Speaker 1: I Think there.

743
00:55:13,423 --> 00:55:17,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was a Mork and Mindy Cartoon that they did which is always.

744
00:55:17,712 --> 00:55:18,416
Speaker 0: I was actually isn't?

745
00:55:18,537 --> 00:55:19,040
Speaker 0: I was talking.

746
00:55:19,442 --> 00:55:32,726
Speaker 0: I was out talking to people online at a different discord a few weeks ago and Someone complained that Like yeah American TV only now realized that like fantasy stuff is really popular like fantasy That's not true at all.

747
00:55:32,846 --> 00:55:43,460
Speaker 0: And it was like yeah, I dream of genie bewitched Mork and Mindy like the old gold shows had really which was also at B, which was also like tremendous.

748
00:55:43,621 --> 00:55:45,249
Speaker 1: I was reading recently somebody.

749
00:55:45,269 --> 00:55:46,756
Speaker 1: I don't know how true this is.

750
00:55:46,837 --> 00:55:47,460
Speaker 1: It sounded true.

751
00:55:48,042 --> 00:55:51,255
Speaker 1: They said they were basically saying yeah bewitched was huge in Japan.

752
00:55:51,275 --> 00:56:00,534
Speaker 1: Yeah, and There they tried to say that it was responsible for a lot of you know The creation of the magical girl stuff which sounds plausible.

753
00:56:00,554 --> 00:56:01,317
Speaker 1: the timings, right?

754
00:56:01,337 --> 00:56:11,628
Speaker 1: Yeah So that's fascinating if true But you know in the quantity it's like yeah the lots and lots of garbage stuff.

755
00:56:11,648 --> 00:56:17,346
Speaker 1: That was Popular for some reason but you know, like the Smurfs was a head of our Barrow show.

756
00:56:17,547 --> 00:56:20,296
Speaker 1: Okay, that was like 256 episodes.

757
00:56:20,356 --> 00:56:22,830
Speaker 1: I only ever saw a few and wasn't that into it?

758
00:56:23,252 --> 00:56:27,210
Speaker 0: I was into Smurfs apparently until and Care Bears - not that that's Hanna-Barbera.

759
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:32,065
Speaker 1: And then they tried to sort of revive Smurfs with Snorks right which weren't as successful.

760
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,630
Speaker 0: I watched the Snorks.

761
00:56:33,952 --> 00:56:37,470
Speaker 0: I would argue the Snorks was a better show than the Smurfs, but it was not good.

762
00:56:38,512 --> 00:56:40,442
Speaker 1: Yeah, well Snorks ran for quite a while.

763
00:56:40,482 --> 00:56:42,010
Speaker 1: It was like 60 something freaking episode.

764
00:56:43,491 --> 00:56:46,770
Speaker 1: Snorks was one of the ones I could have watched cuz it was on Saturday morning.

765
00:56:46,971 --> 00:56:48,399
Speaker 0: I was always watching it when we were.

766
00:56:48,419 --> 00:56:49,625
Speaker 1: it was like Snorks is on.

767
00:56:49,746 --> 00:56:50,390
Speaker 1: change a channel.

768
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:55,390
Speaker 0: We would be a grandma's house like Snorks was just beyond and grandma had a giant TV so we'd watch it.

769
00:56:56,651 --> 00:56:57,314
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did.

770
00:56:57,354 --> 00:56:59,984
Speaker 1: I would change a channel or do something else when Snorks was on.

771
00:57:00,165 --> 00:57:10,726
Speaker 0: Yeah Moby Dick and Mighty Mitor Is an American Saturday morning cartoon Hanna-Barbera CBS.

772
00:57:10,847 --> 00:57:11,630
Speaker 1: There was a cart.

773
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:14,745
Speaker 1: They did a cartoon adaptation of I dream of genie just called genie.

774
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:15,328
Speaker 1: That was 16 episodes.

775
00:57:15,911 --> 00:57:18,108
Speaker 1: I've never even knew that existed till this second.

776
00:57:18,972 --> 00:57:19,935
Speaker 1: You could you could like.

777
00:57:19,955 --> 00:57:24,188
Speaker 1: the sheer quantity is just like off the charts of how much stuff they.

778
00:57:24,208 --> 00:57:30,470
Speaker 0: yeah Just throw it all at the wall And if anything's good put a little more budget into it and milk it forever.

779
00:57:31,373 --> 00:57:41,517
Speaker 1: And I think a lot of it, you know, some of the stuff had some positive like Space Ghost right had a lot of positive aspects mostly because Space Ghost was revived and Reused as a character and other things.

780
00:57:41,557 --> 00:57:45,210
Speaker 1: that was better, but if you watch old Space Ghost, it's not that great.

781
00:57:45,371 --> 00:57:46,958
Speaker 0: It's pretty dire, but it's not.

782
00:57:47,441 --> 00:57:59,150
Speaker 1: it's actually above average for its time Sure, but the their aspects of it in notably the character designs right that were really incredible Even though the stories were not great.

783
00:57:59,331 --> 00:57:59,511
Speaker 1: Well,

784
00:57:59,571 --> 00:58:12,130
Speaker 0: look at what like Space Ghost and contemporary especially like Hanna-Barbera like superhero designs Compared to what superheroes tended to be drawn like in cartoons before that Mmm, there are some imagine

785
00:58:12,511 --> 00:58:12,952
Speaker 1: Interesting

786
00:58:12,972 --> 00:58:18,850
Speaker 0: character designs that you can see a line of thinking that leads to be tasks in the distant future.

787
00:58:19,653 --> 00:58:30,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, what they lacked in writing stories or you know Not always lacked in writing stories, but often lacked in writing stories almost always lacked in animation and production value.

788
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:36,623
Speaker 1: Yeah, right the character design right and that the concepts were almost, you know.

789
00:58:41,052 --> 00:58:44,170
Speaker 1: So that is you know that why a lot of them I think endure.

790
00:58:44,399 --> 00:58:53,210
Speaker 0: Yeah It's on that strength alone The fact that they generally came from because like there there were the shows that were here is a toy.

791
00:58:53,813 --> 00:58:55,200
Speaker 0: Make a show around this toy.

792
00:58:55,442 --> 00:58:59,657
Speaker 0: the show exists solely to sell the toy But all the most Hanna-Barbera stuff was.

793
00:59:00,278 --> 00:59:01,081
Speaker 0: this is a show.

794
00:59:01,141 --> 00:59:05,172
Speaker 0: we are selling the show and then we're advertising things and milking the intellectual Property.

795
00:59:05,674 --> 00:59:09,310
Speaker 1: yes, then we will make merch from the show the character that we made.

796
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:12,668
Speaker 1: Like let's make a character and then try to sell the characters merch after.

797
00:59:12,709 --> 00:59:15,530
Speaker 1: well The the other of course, that's half of it.

798
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:18,990
Speaker 1: The other half was here is an existing intellectual property.

799
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:21,557
Speaker 0: We need a cheap way to milk that with a.

800
00:59:21,657 --> 00:59:32,446
Speaker 1: we want our animated cartoon version of whatever that is to go on television Or in some cases like go BOTS it was like transformers is a big thing.

801
00:59:32,867 --> 00:59:38,606
Speaker 1: Let's make Right, let's we can we can't we don't have that intellectual property, but we can make go BOTS.

802
00:59:38,727 --> 00:59:39,550
Speaker 1: They can't help us.

803
00:59:42,473 --> 00:59:45,591
Speaker 0: The Gary Coleman show Mm-hmm.

804
00:59:46,193 --> 00:59:47,736
Speaker 0: I did not know that existed.

805
00:59:47,757 --> 00:59:51,125
Speaker 1: That's an example of there's an existing popular thing Gary Coleman.

806
00:59:51,145 --> 00:59:52,668
Speaker 1: Let's make an animated version of it.

807
00:59:52,869 --> 00:59:55,889
Speaker 1: Yeah It was very very common.

808
00:59:56,171 --> 01:00:01,846
Speaker 1: So yeah, so this you know Hanna-Barbera right because of wheat the when we were born right we were.

809
01:00:01,926 --> 01:00:12,177
Speaker 1: if you were born any later It really only that if we were born just a little bit later only that like late 90s good Cartoon Network stuff rid of really hit us.

810
01:00:12,477 --> 01:00:14,944
Speaker 1: Yeah, if we were born earlier, it probably would.

811
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:16,769
Speaker 1: this stuff probably would hit us way more.

812
01:00:17,271 --> 01:00:21,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I think later Hanna-Barbera would hit us way more.

813
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:23,840
Speaker 0: The 80s was this specific era like late 70s.

814
01:00:24,181 --> 01:00:35,942
Speaker 0: through the early not like the end of the 80s there was a certain set of Hanna-Barbera stuff that was recycled and almost re-released as new to a generation and Kind of worked like like you said weed.

815
01:00:36,002 --> 01:00:36,485
Speaker 0: That was just.

816
01:00:36,525 --> 01:00:37,510
Speaker 0: that was TV to us.

817
01:00:38,651 --> 01:00:44,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of people our age and I think that most people who are younger they got like nothing cuz he was done.

818
01:00:45,632 --> 01:00:46,616
Speaker 1: It's like they had.

819
01:00:46,656 --> 01:00:49,566
Speaker 1: they lived in like this golden age of you know, like you.

820
01:00:49,606 --> 01:00:52,095
Speaker 0: just adventure time was But it was also.

821
01:00:52,497 --> 01:01:03,709
Speaker 0: there was a yoga bear like Yogi Bear was out in the 60s And so our parents watched it Us and then suddenly Yogi Bear is on TV again and their kids are watching it.

822
01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:11,130
Speaker 0: That was like that one cycle that was rarely replicated before or after like the timing just happened.

823
01:01:12,012 --> 01:01:15,262
Speaker 1: Yeah before then I mean, you know, there wasn't TV always right.

824
01:01:15,282 --> 01:01:20,359
Speaker 1: TV was relatively new before Hanna-Barbera Right, but you know previous generations.

825
01:01:20,399 --> 01:01:23,730
Speaker 1: Well, they're you know, their kids weren't necessarily into the same stuff.

826
01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:26,409
Speaker 1: You know jazz music rock music, right, you know.

827
01:01:27,011 --> 01:01:38,106
Speaker 1: And then this was like they had the chance to like produce the same thing for the two several generations in a row Or at least reproduce right Scooby Doo pup named Scooby Doo, right?

828
01:01:38,789 --> 01:01:43,904
Speaker 1: But We did not we we only sort of did that right, you know, we had transformers.

829
01:01:44,245 --> 01:01:47,617
Speaker 1: then we had like transformers beasts Whatever, you know Ninja Turtles.

830
01:01:48,039 --> 01:01:49,725
Speaker 1: We have that right Ninja Turtles.

831
01:01:49,765 --> 01:01:52,863
Speaker 1: and there's like a newer Ninja Turtles My little pony my little pony.

832
01:01:52,883 --> 01:01:53,730
Speaker 1: friendship is magic.

833
01:01:54,171 --> 01:02:05,129
Speaker 1: Right that pattern sort of continued of the old generations thing being sold to the newer generation But this was taking the original thing unmodified and just putting it back on TV.

834
01:02:06,311 --> 01:02:06,873
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's.

835
01:02:06,933 --> 01:02:10,825
Speaker 1: the difference is that we just had the old 60s Flintstones.

836
01:02:10,865 --> 01:02:12,610
Speaker 1: They didn't make a new Flintstones for us.

837
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:14,077
Speaker 1: We were just why there was.

838
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:15,845
Speaker 1: I guess there was that one.

839
01:02:15,865 --> 01:02:19,077
Speaker 1: we're like Pebbles and bam when we're grown up or whatever.

840
01:02:19,117 --> 01:02:21,967
Speaker 0: that oh my god, I forgot that existed.

841
01:02:22,007 --> 01:02:24,616
Speaker 1: It wasn't good But mostly it was.

842
01:02:24,756 --> 01:02:26,984
Speaker 1: they just showed us the old Flintstones directly.

843
01:02:27,084 --> 01:02:28,730
Speaker 1: No one was gonna take old my little pony.

844
01:02:28,831 --> 01:02:32,332
Speaker 1: Just put it on TV in 2015.

845
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:33,455
Speaker 0: And there's something and I it's.

846
01:02:33,636 --> 01:02:38,430
Speaker 0: I don't think it's that these shows like Hanna-Barbera like had the secret and aged better.

847
01:02:38,832 --> 01:02:43,370
Speaker 0: I think it's just that they made so many things that I had the machine.

848
01:02:43,731 --> 01:02:56,683
Speaker 0: Just a machine but that small subset aged well because they happen to be very good Relative to everything else but like old my little pony not good You know, you couldn't just put some good aspects to it.

849
01:02:56,763 --> 01:02:58,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you couldn't just put that on TV.

850
01:02:58,271 --> 01:02:58,896
Speaker 0: It would not.

851
01:02:58,916 --> 01:03:05,119
Speaker 0: you sound just would not play it And most Hanna-Barbera stuff you could not just put on TV.

852
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:11,609
Speaker 0: that this this very narrow lens of Hanna-Barbera Was successful in this regard and nothing else they made was.

853
01:03:13,252 --> 01:03:20,518
Speaker 0: Those other things were successful in their original runs, but they never came back for a reason In terms of you know, I think it really took.

854
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:28,843
Speaker 1: there's probably something I'm missing but it really feels like you know Disney Afternoon was the the seal breaker right sort of like.

855
01:03:28,923 --> 01:03:30,127
Speaker 1: alright, that's enough of that.

856
01:03:30,327 --> 01:03:35,202
Speaker 0: Yep Couple with me discovering anime when I was in fourth grade.

857
01:03:35,242 --> 01:03:37,770
Speaker 0: really just put it put the brakes on me watching any of this stuff.

858
01:03:38,192 --> 01:03:45,330
Speaker 1: But I'm just saying it, you know up until the Disney Afternoon It was like, okay, we're just churning out whatever for the kids.

859
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:48,598
Speaker 1: Rerun, you know the Looney Tunes like once.

860
01:03:48,899 --> 01:03:59,125
Speaker 0: once any Disney Afternoon thing appeared like once I saw and I saw like 10 seconds of tailspin and Dale rescue Rangers be the first one.

861
01:03:59,427 --> 01:04:01,794
Speaker 0: Oh my god DuckTales the first.

862
01:04:01,814 --> 01:04:05,970
Speaker 1: it was DuckTales and chip and rescue Rangers refers to when those shows came out.

863
01:04:06,191 --> 01:04:13,993
Speaker 0: I don't think I watched a second of 80 Hanna-Barbera like old stuff again after that point adults Pretty much.

864
01:04:14,014 --> 01:04:16,084
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was like, you know, here.

865
01:04:16,125 --> 01:04:17,070
Speaker 1: Let me show you the real stuff.

866
01:04:19,392 --> 01:04:25,764
Speaker 0: Kids today with your like Adventure Time is the old show at this point Like you couldn't even have like, you know to put on.

867
01:04:25,784 --> 01:04:26,930
Speaker 1: you know, like tailspin.

868
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:27,211
Speaker 1: It's like.

869
01:04:27,231 --> 01:04:29,279
Speaker 1: what show could you put on before or after it?

870
01:04:29,319 --> 01:04:31,788
Speaker 1: that wouldn't make the contrast to a parent, right?

871
01:04:34,893 --> 01:04:37,726
Speaker 0: And then snagglepuss comes on stage, hey, yeah, it's like.

872
01:04:37,826 --> 01:04:38,429
Speaker 1: what is this?

873
01:04:41,302 --> 01:04:44,050
Speaker 0: You Haven't seen Westworld which you showed at some point.

874
01:04:44,070 --> 01:04:47,490
Speaker 0: I think you'd really like it because it's a cyber saw the old Brenner Westworld a long time ago.

875
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:48,132
Speaker 1: Yeah, the dude.

876
01:04:48,273 --> 01:04:51,725
Speaker 0: I don't remember much you would enjoy the new Westworld specifically.

877
01:04:51,766 --> 01:04:53,792
Speaker 0: I think I know you won't watch it So it doesn't matter

878
01:04:53,873 --> 01:04:55,236
Speaker 1: plus in it now, but

879
01:04:55,658 --> 01:05:07,970
Speaker 0: there's a scene where a character who is an AI is Sees a picture from like the real world Like the outside like a tourist leaves a picture behind and they're programmed to not be able to recognize modern things.

880
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:08,974
Speaker 0: And there's the scene.

881
01:05:09,094 --> 01:05:13,130
Speaker 0: she's looking at this picture and she's just like like someone shows that you were like.

882
01:05:13,190 --> 01:05:13,895
Speaker 0: What do you think of this?

883
01:05:13,915 --> 01:05:16,330
Speaker 0: because he's trying to like do a thing and she looks at it.

884
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:19,299
Speaker 0: She's like, but I don't see anything like.

885
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:20,684
Speaker 0: I don't see anything at all.

886
01:05:21,065 --> 01:05:22,590
Speaker 0: I don't understand what I'm looking at.

887
01:05:22,911 --> 01:05:31,690
Speaker 0: I feel like that is how a kid today after they saw like the modern DuckTales would react to Any amount of snagglepuss animation?

888
01:05:32,830 --> 01:05:43,508
Speaker 1: yeah, and this isn't like a situation where like It Was just it where it was like bad for its, you know, it's just old and that's why it looks that way, right?

889
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:44,791
Speaker 1: It's at.

890
01:05:44,872 --> 01:05:46,698
Speaker 1: it's like no tailspin like holds up.

891
01:05:46,758 --> 01:05:47,901
Speaker 1: You can watch that now.

892
01:05:48,142 --> 01:05:49,487
Speaker 0: Yeah, I despite tails held up.

893
01:05:49,587 --> 01:05:52,259
Speaker 0: Okay It's just the new DuckTales made.

894
01:05:52,279 --> 01:05:54,470
Speaker 0: it honestly did a way better job, right?

895
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:55,453
Speaker 1: Is that the quality?

896
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:59,210
Speaker 1: the quality level of it was just like, you know below?

897
01:05:59,994 --> 01:06:02,075
Speaker 1: par Unacceptable levels off.

898
01:06:02,095 --> 01:06:02,777
Speaker 0: it had a barbera.

899
01:06:02,818 --> 01:06:06,669
Speaker 0: They knew what they were doing low production value on purpose.

900
01:06:08,431 --> 01:06:14,830
Speaker 1: You know even something like, you know, Rocky and Bullwinkle wasn't Hannah Barbara, but it had a low production value.

901
01:06:15,433 --> 01:06:23,385
Speaker 1: But it also made up, you know, I had writing was way better Right, Rocky and Bullwinkle had writing and and and also the character design.

902
01:06:23,425 --> 01:06:25,030
Speaker 1: so it had two things, right?

903
01:06:25,330 --> 01:06:30,010
Speaker 1: So we could Rocky Bullwinkle holds up on that even though there's no animation really to speak.

904
01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:39,926
Speaker 0: I feel like you could take any long-running old Hannah Barbara show run it into a AI Natural text generator platform and it would just spit out scripts.

905
01:06:40,006 --> 01:06:40,749
Speaker 0: That would be good enough.

906
01:06:41,655 --> 01:06:43,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean Rocky Bullwinkle is a freakin cereal, right?

907
01:06:44,673 --> 01:06:45,681
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was like it was.

908
01:06:45,721 --> 01:06:55,858
Speaker 1: basically when you think about it Rocky Bullwinkle is really just a radio show that just happened to have a happen to have like loosely animated Animatics on top of it, but it was a really.

909
01:06:55,919 --> 01:06:56,762
Speaker 1: but it was a really.

910
01:06:56,782 --> 01:07:03,150
Speaker 1: if you just listen to Rocky and Bullwinkle That's probably like a top tier radio cereal like as good as the shadow.

911
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:09,536
Speaker 0: Oh, I saw a great Twitter thread recently where someone was listening to a bunch of old radio dramas and they were like no Don't like.

912
01:07:09,596 --> 01:07:10,804
Speaker 0: venerate these old shows.

913
01:07:10,885 --> 01:07:14,842
Speaker 0: Most of them are Hot garbage unlistenable shit.

914
01:07:14,882 --> 01:07:16,450
Speaker 0: Just let them be lost to time.

915
01:07:17,176 --> 01:07:17,761
Speaker 1: That is true.

916
01:07:18,165 --> 01:07:18,690
Speaker 1: Very true.

917
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:22,909
Speaker 0: But a few survived because they weren't like they were the good ones.

918
01:07:23,272 --> 01:07:26,313
Speaker 0: Exactly the shadow and the rock in the shed We had.

919
01:07:26,595 --> 01:07:29,790
Speaker 0: we had so much of the shadow on LPS that we would listen to at night.

920
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:30,893
Speaker 1: You can just download it all now.

921
01:07:30,953 --> 01:07:34,564
Speaker 0: I think who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men.

922
01:07:35,166 --> 01:07:36,450
