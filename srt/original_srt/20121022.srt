1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,086
Speaker 1: It's Monday, October 22nd, 2012.

2
00:00:13,086 --> 00:00:13,607
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,907 --> 00:00:14,448
Speaker 0: I'm Sky.

4
00:00:14,588 --> 00:00:16,470
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:24,399
Speaker 1: Tonight, contributing to open source projects and why most people don't.

6
00:00:25,622 --> 00:00:26,658
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:28,482 --> 00:00:32,332
Speaker 1: So in the course of a man's life, he learns many things by experience.

8
00:00:32,372 --> 00:00:35,300
Speaker 1: You will occasionally experience a thing you have never experienced before.

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,794
Speaker 1: And good or ill, a man gets to understand what that experience entails.

10
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:44,340
Speaker 1: So today I had one of those experiences.

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,460
Speaker 0: Lost your virginity.

12
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:52,412
Speaker 1: So I was walking into the Fulton Street station to take the 4-5 train back uptown.

13
00:00:53,474 --> 00:00:56,600
Speaker 1: And while I was walking down, the fire alarm in the subway station.

14
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,900
Speaker 1: Which until this point, I never even considered the possibility of a fire alarm in the subway station.

15
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, sometimes you hear the alarm on the emergency door.

16
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:07,439
Speaker 1: Sometimes you mean every time.

17
00:01:08,841 --> 00:01:12,109
Speaker 0: Because people are opening the door and it sets off the emergency alarm.

18
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:16,060
Speaker 0: And I figured that that was, I guess, without even really thinking hard about it.

19
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,140
Speaker 0: I figured that is the fire alarm of the subway station.

20
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:18,762
Speaker 1: No, it is not.

21
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:23,900
Speaker 1: So I go to the Fulton Street station and there are people streaming out of it more so than usual.

22
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:30,460
Speaker 1: But usually when there's that many people streaming out, I assume there's some sort of fuck up with the subway.

23
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:34,853
Speaker 1: Like oh, the 4-5 is not running and all these people are trying to get to the 1-2-3, maybe the 9 if they're really old.

24
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,270
Speaker 1: So I go down anyway because I live like a wind rammer.

25
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:44,640
Speaker 1: And I get down there, the fire alarm is just fucking going off.

26
00:01:46,187 --> 00:01:46,510
Speaker 0: Alright.

27
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,399
Speaker 0: Was it painful to listen to?

28
00:01:47,981 --> 00:01:53,180
Speaker 1: No, it sounded like a normal fire alarm but it was drowned out by the generic noise of the subway station.

29
00:01:54,043 --> 00:01:55,659
Speaker 1: But the strobes were going off too.

30
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,365
Speaker 0: What about the PA?

31
00:01:56,386 --> 00:01:57,759
Speaker 0: Was there anyone talking in the PA?

32
00:01:58,442 --> 00:01:58,595
Speaker 0: Nope.

33
00:01:59,483 --> 00:02:04,080
Speaker 1: Now I would not have noticed the fire alarm had the strobes not also been going off.

34
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,239
Speaker 1: There are a lot of them and I'd never noticed them there before.

35
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:07,815
Speaker 0: Me either.

36
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,840
Speaker 1: So, despite all the people who had streamed out, the vast majority of the people were ignoring it and waiting for a subway train.

37
00:02:14,942 --> 00:02:15,300
Speaker 0: Of course.

38
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,063
Speaker 1: And a subway train came immediately.

39
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:25,660
Speaker 1: And as I've done in my entire life, I will continue to do now in the subway too, I've ignored every fire alarm I've ever heard.

40
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,000
Speaker 0: And you got on the subway?

41
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,799
Speaker 1: I got on the subway.

42
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:28,880
Speaker 0: And it took you to the next stop?

43
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,719
Speaker 1: Everything was normal.

44
00:02:30,388 --> 00:02:30,700
Speaker 0: Perfect.

45
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,060
Speaker 1: I've never been in a building that had a legitimate fire alarm in my entire life.

46
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,960
Speaker 1: But I've experienced hundreds upon hundreds of either false alarms or fire drills.

47
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:48,740
Speaker 0: Well, I have experienced legitimate fires but they were not fires that would threaten me in any way.

48
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,755
Speaker 0: For example, a guy burning something in the microwave.

49
00:02:50,775 --> 00:02:51,420
Speaker 0: There is a fire.

50
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,640
Speaker 1: You mean at RIT when Greg burned that egg and our entire building had been evacuated?

51
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,200
Speaker 0: You cannot say that it is not fire to some extent but it is not a fire that threatens my life in any way.

52
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,260
Speaker 0: You know what that fire threatened?

53
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,140
Speaker 0: It is not a fire worthy of evacuating.

54
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,643
Speaker 1: That fire, you know what it threatened?

55
00:03:07,024 --> 00:03:14,080
Speaker 1: I remember that it fucking ruined my beef stroganoff because I was in the middle of cooking it and then the alarm went off and campus safety made me get out of the apartment.

56
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,179
Speaker 1: That was actually one of the maddest I've ever been in my life.

57
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,069
Speaker 1: That's like top 15 mad.

58
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,748
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's Monday.

59
00:03:22,768 --> 00:03:24,152
Speaker 1: Got any news?

60
00:03:24,213 --> 00:03:24,955
Speaker 1: Any Monday?

61
00:03:25,055 --> 00:03:26,400
Speaker 1: science technology news?

62
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,582
Speaker 0: I do have sort of a news.

63
00:03:28,764 --> 00:03:36,880
Speaker 0: I don't really care about this that much but it's an internet explosion today of controversy and it has a couple interesting side topics.

64
00:03:37,521 --> 00:03:40,550
Speaker 0: So there's some person from Northern Europe.

65
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,178
Speaker 0: I'm not sure if it is the Sweden, Norway or Finland.

66
00:03:43,218 --> 00:03:43,940
Speaker 0: It's one of the three.

67
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,659
Speaker 1: I like how there's the only three you think of.

68
00:03:46,162 --> 00:03:50,219
Speaker 0: I think it might be the Sweden because it's got the director with the O with the slash through it.

69
00:03:51,060 --> 00:04:10,296
Speaker 0: But anyway, some person who travels a lot had a Kindle and they bought a lot of books and basically suddenly all their Kindle books were gone and they emailed Amazon a whole bunch and Amazon was all like, yes, your account was linked to an account that had problems.

70
00:04:11,037 --> 00:04:14,640
Speaker 0: that, you know, violated terms or something along those lines is misbehaving.

71
00:04:15,162 --> 00:04:19,959
Speaker 0: So we just you know, we just closed your account and now wait a minute.

72
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:27,220
Speaker 1: So my I mean, my account that does my like AWS and EC2 and whatever is also my account for like buying bullshit on the Internet.

73
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:27,762
Speaker 0: Right.

74
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:31,920
Speaker 0: But anyway, so this person emailed back and they were like, is it correct?

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,500
Speaker 0: You cannot give me any information about one how my account is linked to the blocked account to the name ID of the related blocked account.

76
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,220
Speaker 0: Three, what policy was violated?

77
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,667
Speaker 0: I have no knowledge about any other account that could be related to mine.

78
00:04:42,928 --> 00:04:45,556
Speaker 0: Cannot understand how it could have violated your policies in any way.

79
00:04:46,017 --> 00:04:46,719
Speaker 0: Best regards.

80
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:46,940
Speaker 0: Right.

81
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,385
Speaker 0: So Amazon is pretty much like.

82
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,552
Speaker 0: we regret that we have not been able to address your concerns, your satisfaction.

83
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:56,300
Speaker 0: Unfortunately, we will not be able to offer any additional insight or action on these matters.

84
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:03,020
Speaker 0: We wish you luck in locating a retailer better able to meet your needs and will not be able to offer any additional insight or action on these matters.

85
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,682
Speaker 1: I would sue.

86
00:05:03,702 --> 00:05:05,126
Speaker 0: I would also sue.

87
00:05:05,146 --> 00:05:09,880
Speaker 0: But this person's in a foreign country making it very difficult to sue.

88
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,244
Speaker 0: But this is the perfect thing for small claims court.

89
00:05:12,264 --> 00:05:21,360
Speaker 0: Like I would go to I'll be like, I want the full value of all the books I paid refunded and I want interest and I want, you know, the value of this Kindle is now useless.

90
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,904
Speaker 0: And I want all these things.

91
00:05:23,887 --> 00:05:28,060
Speaker 0: But for a person in a foreign country dealing with an American company, I guess they were dealing with Amazon Co.

92
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,526
Speaker 0: I would sue the UK, it seems, because that's what the signature in the email says.

93
00:05:31,546 --> 00:05:39,120
Speaker 0: You know, it might be difficult to sue a company in the UK or the US if you're in Finland, Norway, Sweden.

94
00:05:40,761 --> 00:05:43,727
Speaker 0: But yet the things I want to address here is number one.

95
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:45,851
Speaker 1: That's bullshit.

96
00:05:45,931 --> 00:05:47,154
Speaker 0: Do not buy it.

97
00:05:47,174 --> 00:05:48,016
Speaker 0: Don't know if it's true.

98
00:05:48,417 --> 00:05:48,597
Speaker 0: Right.

99
00:05:48,617 --> 00:05:49,980
Speaker 0: This could be a whole fake thing here.

100
00:05:50,721 --> 00:05:53,865
Speaker 1: I would kind of lean toward it being true, I guess.

101
00:05:53,905 --> 00:05:57,450
Speaker 0: I'm not saying there isn't a lot of evidence except for text, copy, paste of emails.

102
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,670
Speaker 0: Right.

103
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:05,080
Speaker 0: So I even though I have a Kindle, I have never bought a DRM book in my life.

104
00:06:05,501 --> 00:06:07,043
Speaker 1: I've bought several because I'm a lazy ass.

105
00:06:07,063 --> 00:06:16,900
Speaker 0: The only DRM things that I have bought in my life are number one, steam games and number two, I guess Netflix streaming is counts as DRM, maybe not because that's streaming.

106
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,004
Speaker 1: I know I don't own those things.

107
00:06:19,184 --> 00:06:22,610
Speaker 1: I am paying for the service as opposed to the individual works.

108
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:23,752
Speaker 0: That's it, steam games.

109
00:06:24,032 --> 00:06:28,039
Speaker 0: And I guess Adobe Cloud, does that count as DRM?

110
00:06:32,262 --> 00:06:33,745
Speaker 1: I am paying for the service there too.

111
00:06:33,766 --> 00:06:36,753
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's something they could turn off and then I wouldn't be able to download them anymore.

112
00:06:36,793 --> 00:06:39,280
Speaker 0: But I'd also stop paying and I'm paying monthly, so whatever.

113
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,083
Speaker 1: So that's right.

114
00:06:41,263 --> 00:06:44,808
Speaker 1: But this is I bought a book for ten dollars and now it's gone.

115
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:45,589
Speaker 0: Yeah.

116
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:46,330
Speaker 0: So, yeah.

117
00:06:46,411 --> 00:06:47,492
Speaker 0: Do not ever buy.

118
00:06:47,512 --> 00:06:52,720
Speaker 0: I don't care if you're using a Nook or Apple iBooks or Amazon, even though I like Amazon.

119
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,865
Speaker 0: I have an Amazon credit card and buy all kinds of things on Amazon.

120
00:06:56,346 --> 00:06:57,888
Speaker 0: Do not buy e-books on Amazon.

121
00:06:57,908 --> 00:07:01,554
Speaker 0: Well, I only use my Kindle reading story.

122
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:05,020
Speaker 0: Of course, reading Project Gutenberg and other pirated books.

123
00:07:05,581 --> 00:07:07,344
Speaker 1: Now, I think there is another way to take.

124
00:07:08,085 --> 00:07:15,038
Speaker 1: Crack the DRM on every e-book you buy and save a backup of it, which I think I'm going to back up a little bit.

125
00:07:15,318 --> 00:07:16,440
Speaker 1: There should be a law.

126
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,606
Speaker 0: And if even though it's not legal, you should definitely do, you know, civil disobedience.

127
00:07:21,626 --> 00:07:33,700
Speaker 1: There should be a law or in fact, a constitutional amendment guaranteeing the rights to first sale and backups of things you have purchased that are digital and in general transferability of digital goods.

128
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:42,796
Speaker 0: But anyway, the other thing I really want to talk about here is the general concept that companies just not fucking talking to people.

129
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:43,457
Speaker 0: Right.

130
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:45,040
Speaker 1: It's like I can tell you why.

131
00:07:45,881 --> 00:07:47,685
Speaker 0: Well, of course, we know a lot of reasons why.

132
00:07:47,705 --> 00:07:48,026
Speaker 0: Yeah.

133
00:07:48,046 --> 00:07:48,988
Speaker 1: You don't want to get sued.

134
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:50,111
Speaker 1: Anything you say.

135
00:07:50,131 --> 00:07:51,875
Speaker 1: The other person probably can't sue you.

136
00:07:51,915 --> 00:07:53,940
Speaker 1: But the more you say, the more ammo they have.

137
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,260
Speaker 1: Yeah.

138
00:07:54,521 --> 00:07:56,084
Speaker 1: It costs money to provide support.

139
00:07:56,144 --> 00:08:02,415
Speaker 1: So there's no reason to ever provide support because nobody makes the decision to buy a product based on the support.

140
00:08:02,656 --> 00:08:04,980
Speaker 1: They just get pissed off after they already bought.

141
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:05,461
Speaker 0: Exactly.

142
00:08:05,741 --> 00:08:07,806
Speaker 0: Google provides no support whatsoever.

143
00:08:08,248 --> 00:08:13,200
Speaker 0: The only way to get support from Google is if you pay for Google apps and you are a company.

144
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,682
Speaker 1: Let alone Lenovo.

145
00:08:14,742 --> 00:08:14,942
Speaker 1: Right.

146
00:08:15,002 --> 00:08:17,765
Speaker 1: So Windows got corrupted on my my new laptop.

147
00:08:17,825 --> 00:08:18,025
Speaker 1: Right.

148
00:08:18,386 --> 00:08:19,847
Speaker 1: It still works, but it has some problems.

149
00:08:19,927 --> 00:08:21,369
Speaker 1: I got to reinstall from the media.

150
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,431
Speaker 1: The media I made just don't fucking work.

151
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:30,940
Speaker 1: Oh, you know, I you know, I've been trying for weeks to get a hold of anyone at Lenovo who knows fuck all.

152
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:31,440
Speaker 1: Yeah.

153
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,385
Speaker 0: They just send you a disk, right?

154
00:08:34,865 --> 00:08:36,107
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah.

155
00:08:36,147 --> 00:08:38,510
Speaker 1: They want to charge me like 50 bucks for a disk.

156
00:08:38,671 --> 00:08:41,034
Speaker 0: Well, that went in to give them credit, though.

157
00:08:41,335 --> 00:08:44,459
Speaker 0: You can get the disk in the checkout process and it costs money.

158
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,020
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

159
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,606
Speaker 0: So to buy the disk after the fact on the checkout process.

160
00:08:48,766 --> 00:08:51,791
Speaker 1: But the thing is, I created the media per their instructions.

161
00:08:53,214 --> 00:08:54,676
Speaker 1: And the media itself doesn't work.

162
00:08:54,716 --> 00:08:56,199
Speaker 0: And is the laptop still under warranty?

163
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:56,880
Speaker 1: Yes.

164
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,645
Speaker 0: Now, then, yeah, they should definitely do something.

165
00:08:59,765 --> 00:09:01,488
Speaker 1: So, yeah, good luck getting them to do that.

166
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:03,151
Speaker 1: But it's like, you know, what about cell phones?

167
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:04,072
Speaker 1: What about cell phones?

168
00:09:04,112 --> 00:09:06,076
Speaker 1: So Verizon has pretty crap service.

169
00:09:06,336 --> 00:09:06,797
Speaker 1: What do I do?

170
00:09:06,857 --> 00:09:07,578
Speaker 1: Go to Sprint?

171
00:09:07,658 --> 00:09:08,660
Speaker 1: It's even worse there.

172
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,441
Speaker 1: AT&T.

173
00:09:09,461 --> 00:09:09,921
Speaker 1: Good luck.

174
00:09:10,322 --> 00:09:11,363
Speaker 0: Yeah.

175
00:09:11,643 --> 00:09:15,889
Speaker 0: But for example, I signed up for that mentoring thing and the paperwork.

176
00:09:15,909 --> 00:09:24,100
Speaker 0: There was one piece of paperwork I noted that said, you know, if we reject you, we you know, this is in English, right?

177
00:09:24,801 --> 00:09:31,651
Speaker 0: It basically effectively said in legal speak, if we reject you, we don't have to ever tell you a reason why or anything.

178
00:09:31,731 --> 00:09:35,476
Speaker 0: Now, it's interesting because we are under no obligation to tell you the reason why we reject you.

179
00:09:35,516 --> 00:09:38,060
Speaker 0: We're just going to say, you know, you're rejected.

180
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,360
Speaker 0: Goodbye.

181
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,061
Speaker 1: So two things.

182
00:09:39,281 --> 00:09:42,786
Speaker 1: One, say I like say geek nights, like we hired people for geek nights.

183
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:52,160
Speaker 1: If we ever fired anyone, we would never, ever give a reason because that just opens you up to liability in case that reason can in any way be construed to be discriminatory.

184
00:09:52,761 --> 00:09:59,615
Speaker 1: But because you're not legally obligated to give a reason, it's kind of like how it's your best interest to never talk to the police, even if you're innocent.

185
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:02,260
Speaker 1: It's in your best interest to never give a reason for anything.

186
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:13,180
Speaker 0: But I actually even though I would open up myself to liability, right, I would tell someone the reason if I was firing them and they didn't want to be fired because that's what a non asshole does.

187
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:23,489
Speaker 0: Listen, Joe, you know, but we're running out of money and, you know, everyone else plays solitaire for two hours a day and you play solitaire for four hours a day.

188
00:10:24,851 --> 00:10:28,694
Speaker 0: And, you know, so and so can do your work in the two hours of solitaire.

189
00:10:28,734 --> 00:10:32,498
Speaker 0: And so and so else can do the other two hours of work if they stop playing solitaire.

190
00:10:33,239 --> 00:10:34,700
Speaker 0: And we just someone has to go.

191
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,542
Speaker 1: Scott, there's a reason.

192
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:36,967
Speaker 0: there's no other ways you can save money.

193
00:10:36,988 --> 00:10:39,095
Speaker 1: There's a reason why most companies have an H.R.

194
00:10:39,136 --> 00:10:40,200
Speaker 1: person do that and not.

195
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,781
Speaker 0: That's how it's going to be.

196
00:10:43,622 --> 00:10:49,346
Speaker 1: But the other thing, there is one realm where that is actually a specific protected thing, and that is credit.

197
00:10:49,706 --> 00:10:58,933
Speaker 1: If I say apply for a mortgage and they deny me because of my credit report, they have to tell me and they have to tell me what part of my credit report they use to make that decision.

198
00:10:59,073 --> 00:10:59,413
Speaker 1: Interesting.

199
00:11:00,074 --> 00:11:00,834
Speaker 0: Interesting.

200
00:11:01,054 --> 00:11:01,695
Speaker 1: You didn't know that?

201
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:02,515
Speaker 0: Did not know.

202
00:11:02,535 --> 00:11:03,036
Speaker 1: I guess you've.

203
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,677
Speaker 1: you've never applied for a mortgage, have you?

204
00:11:04,777 --> 00:11:07,959
Speaker 1: Well, no, but you ever applied for a line of credit that wasn't a credit card.

205
00:11:07,979 --> 00:11:09,260
Speaker 1: because they also have to tell you.

206
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:16,150
Speaker 0: Well, I have done things that I've done a lot of things that aren't necessarily applying for credit, but require credit checks.

207
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:19,054
Speaker 0: For example, when you go to get a cell phone, they always run a credit check on you.

208
00:11:19,094 --> 00:11:19,254
Speaker 0: Yeah.

209
00:11:19,274 --> 00:11:23,300
Speaker 0: So they're also make you like make a deposit and stuff like that.

210
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,907
Speaker 1: I remember the first cell phone you tried to buy back in the early days of cell phones.

211
00:11:26,947 --> 00:11:29,552
Speaker 1: They were like, yeah, you need to put down five hundred bucks.

212
00:11:29,572 --> 00:11:30,955
Speaker 1: And you were like, why?

213
00:11:30,975 --> 00:11:33,560
Speaker 1: I was like, no, I don't have five hundred bucks.

214
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,601
Speaker 0: Right.

215
00:11:36,882 --> 00:11:38,523
Speaker 1: But, yeah, there's laws about that for credit.

216
00:11:38,543 --> 00:11:46,949
Speaker 1: But yet this is another situation where we have a very complex, probably overly complex regulatory framework in a very narrow area.

217
00:11:47,429 --> 00:12:03,160
Speaker 1: But yet because our law is so slow to update and everyone in our government is so old and incompetent and slow and corrupt and old and slow and old and corrupt that an old that we there's ten other things that are the same situation that have no regulation.

218
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:10,253
Speaker 0: I'm just saying it's bad that we have a system set up to incentivize not being nice and not explaining things to people.

219
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:13,759
Speaker 0: We should give some sort of protection to you.

220
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:22,295
Speaker 0: And the other thing is, you know, if you're thinking you're sitting there right and you have a company and you can decide, all right, we're going to screw this customer for a reason.

221
00:12:22,656 --> 00:12:23,718
Speaker 0: We've decided to do that.

222
00:12:23,738 --> 00:12:24,840
Speaker 0: We're not changing that decision.

223
00:12:25,241 --> 00:12:29,771
Speaker 0: We can tell them the reason, but that might open us to legal liability or not.

224
00:12:29,871 --> 00:12:33,720
Speaker 0: tell them the reason to protect ourselves or but maybe.

225
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:34,623
Speaker 0: Right.

226
00:12:35,327 --> 00:12:37,460
Speaker 0: You know, they could still try to sue us either way.

227
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,682
Speaker 1: Wait, so how about this?

228
00:12:38,863 --> 00:12:39,545
Speaker 1: How about a DMC?

229
00:12:39,565 --> 00:12:42,813
Speaker 0: Maybe if we're nice to them, they won't even sue us.

230
00:12:42,853 --> 00:12:44,617
Speaker 0: So maybe that's the better option.

231
00:12:44,637 --> 00:12:45,620
Speaker 0: And they're not even figuring.

232
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,662
Speaker 1: There's another answer.

233
00:12:47,002 --> 00:12:50,408
Speaker 1: Maybe just to save money by not having people even worry about this.

234
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:51,930
Speaker 1: You just don't know.

235
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:57,279
Speaker 1: your support basically just has an autoresponder that gives a form letter and no human ever even sees it.

236
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:58,601
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

237
00:12:58,902 --> 00:12:59,704
Speaker 1: That's one way to go.

238
00:12:59,804 --> 00:13:05,419
Speaker 0: And the other thing is think about what small percentage of the customers are actually going to get mad at the form letter rejection.

239
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:05,660
Speaker 0: Right.

240
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,962
Speaker 0: So the few that say I do.

241
00:13:07,062 --> 00:13:18,580
Speaker 0: But yeah, but the few the very few who actually fight and want reasons, I think it might actually be worth your time to give the reasons and talk to them and be nice to them because, number one, you guarantee that this blog post will never happen.

242
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,363
Speaker 1: Now, that means at least one human involved.

243
00:13:20,844 --> 00:13:21,285
Speaker 0: It does.

244
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,169
Speaker 0: It will cost you money, but better.

245
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:28,640
Speaker 0: Well, maybe if those people have good experiences and blog those, you could just take that out of the market.

246
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,601
Speaker 1: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

247
00:13:29,641 --> 00:13:30,402
Speaker 1: Let me put on my.

248
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:32,145
Speaker 0: Consider that to be marketing.

249
00:13:32,165 --> 00:13:33,346
Speaker 1: Scott, let me put on my.

250
00:13:33,366 --> 00:13:34,147
Speaker 0: Look at how much.

251
00:13:34,388 --> 00:13:34,888
Speaker 0: Think about this.

252
00:13:34,969 --> 00:13:35,129
Speaker 0: Right.

253
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,511
Speaker 0: Imagine if PayPal had done that.

254
00:13:36,591 --> 00:13:43,400
Speaker 0: How many people hate PayPal and refuse to use it because of all the bullshit of locking accounts, taking people's money.

255
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,221
Speaker 1: You want to know how many?

256
00:13:44,382 --> 00:13:45,103
Speaker 1: Like four.

257
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:46,866
Speaker 1: Nobody gives a shit about that except us.

258
00:13:46,907 --> 00:13:48,269
Speaker 0: And you use it anyway.

259
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,371
Speaker 0: I don't because I don't care.

260
00:13:49,432 --> 00:13:50,614
Speaker 0: But there are thousands of people.

261
00:13:50,634 --> 00:13:53,680
Speaker 0: No, there's so few people who complain about PayPal all the time.

262
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,641
Speaker 0: If PayPal had just.

263
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:58,444
Speaker 0: No, Scott, you're out with people, Scott, who had their accounts locked.

264
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,525
Speaker 1: No, the people who care.

265
00:13:59,685 --> 00:14:00,986
Speaker 0: And people love PayPal.

266
00:14:01,026 --> 00:14:04,069
Speaker 1: No, because the people most people use PayPal anyway.

267
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:12,596
Speaker 1: The tiny minority who care is kind of like how Best Buy and clothing stores will basically just ban customers who return stuff or assholes are annoying.

268
00:14:12,636 --> 00:14:14,458
Speaker 0: Well, those are assholes are annoying.

269
00:14:14,818 --> 00:14:16,700
Speaker 0: This is someone who has a legitimate problem.

270
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,869
Speaker 0: How about all those people who had charities who got too much money and they just locked their account for no reason?

271
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:22,129
Speaker 1: Fuck them.

272
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:23,552
Speaker 1: Enough people use PayPal anyway.

273
00:14:23,592 --> 00:14:23,893
Speaker 0: What is that?

274
00:14:23,933 --> 00:14:27,700
Speaker 1: Why did you even lock that person to to prevent any sort of.

275
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,803
Speaker 0: And also, if you're if you're right.

276
00:14:30,044 --> 00:14:30,284
Speaker 0: Right.

277
00:14:30,344 --> 00:14:34,130
Speaker 0: There's a new person in charge of PayPal now and they're doing what I said.

278
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:37,516
Speaker 0: They're working to fix this problem of people getting their accounts locked.

279
00:14:37,536 --> 00:14:39,860
Speaker 1: Maybe or maybe they're saying they're doing that now.

280
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,585
Speaker 0: At the very least, they're being nicer, which is I am in favor of.

281
00:14:43,605 --> 00:14:45,167
Speaker 1: So let me put on a cynical rimhead.

282
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:46,569
Speaker 1: So all right.

283
00:14:47,431 --> 00:14:51,857
Speaker 1: Why bother having anyone be proactive about this?

284
00:14:51,877 --> 00:14:53,540
Speaker 1: Because then there's a human who has to worry about it.

285
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,881
Speaker 0: No, you don't be proactive.

286
00:14:54,901 --> 00:14:55,642
Speaker 0: You just be reactive.

287
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:57,866
Speaker 0: When the asshole when this kind of article happens.

288
00:14:58,266 --> 00:14:58,587
Speaker 0: Right.

289
00:14:58,827 --> 00:15:02,633
Speaker 0: You talk to the person, but you know, why even talk to the person?

290
00:15:02,713 --> 00:15:07,480
Speaker 1: Why not just ignore it completely because of the Barbra Streisand effect?

291
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:12,652
Speaker 1: If you actually ignore something on the Internet, it has to be so big to go.

292
00:15:12,672 --> 00:15:14,796
Speaker 1: It's kind of like when the president that this is not.

293
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:16,460
Speaker 0: this is not the Streisand effect.

294
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,062
Speaker 1: No, Scott, it's similar, though.

295
00:15:18,202 --> 00:15:18,643
Speaker 1: Hear me out.

296
00:15:18,823 --> 00:15:24,351
Speaker 1: Now, if if you just ignore something on the Internet, that's the equivalent of the president vetoing something from Congress.

297
00:15:24,892 --> 00:15:30,840
Speaker 1: You had so much bullshit has to happen for the Internet to continue to care about anything for more than a week.

298
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,342
Speaker 0: That's not the Streisand effect at all.

299
00:15:32,362 --> 00:15:35,507
Speaker 0: The Streisand effect is when there is something that nobody notices.

300
00:15:35,527 --> 00:15:36,088
Speaker 1: Yes, Scott.

301
00:15:36,148 --> 00:15:37,010
Speaker 1: I'm well aware.

302
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,953
Speaker 0: Point it out and say stop.

303
00:15:39,113 --> 00:15:39,494
Speaker 0: Yes, Scott.

304
00:15:39,534 --> 00:15:40,175
Speaker 1: I'm well aware.

305
00:15:40,195 --> 00:15:40,555
Speaker 0: This is not.

306
00:15:40,595 --> 00:15:41,577
Speaker 0: even this is not.

307
00:15:41,657 --> 00:15:43,580
Speaker 1: it already exploded on the Internet.

308
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,126
Speaker 1: Scott, did you realize it only exploded among super nerds?

309
00:15:47,206 --> 00:15:48,388
Speaker 1: No one else gives a no.

310
00:15:48,428 --> 00:15:50,472
Speaker 0: This was all over the all Internet.

311
00:15:50,632 --> 00:15:51,394
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Internet.

312
00:15:51,414 --> 00:15:52,496
Speaker 1: What about the rest of the country?

313
00:15:52,516 --> 00:15:53,738
Speaker 0: It was not just on the nerd Internet.

314
00:15:53,758 --> 00:15:54,780
Speaker 0: It was on the full Internet.

315
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,020
Speaker 0: Yeah.

316
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,421
Speaker 0: And, you know, I saw it on Google News.

317
00:15:56,461 --> 00:15:56,921
Speaker 0: You know what?

318
00:15:57,322 --> 00:16:01,985
Speaker 1: If Amazon literally completely ignores it, I guarantee within two weeks no one will be talking about.

319
00:16:02,005 --> 00:16:03,726
Speaker 0: It's not exactly the biggest news story in the world.

320
00:16:03,766 --> 00:16:04,587
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm saying this.

321
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:10,170
Speaker 1: The thing it's better from cynical rooms perspective to literally ignore anything like that.

322
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:16,354
Speaker 0: If it would be better for it not to have happened in the first place, which you could have done just by saying I would argue that no effect on Amazon.

323
00:16:16,414 --> 00:16:17,215
Speaker 1: No, no.

324
00:16:17,255 --> 00:16:18,616
Speaker 1: Literally, I'm serious.

325
00:16:18,776 --> 00:16:24,760
Speaker 1: I don't think that this will have any effect at all on any portion of Amazon.

326
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,582
Speaker 1: In any way whatsoever.

327
00:16:27,262 --> 00:16:28,143
Speaker 0: I think there will be.

328
00:16:28,163 --> 00:16:30,165
Speaker 1: there will be zero backlash.

329
00:16:30,245 --> 00:16:31,286
Speaker 0: Hundreds of people.

330
00:16:31,566 --> 00:16:42,716
Speaker 1: Everyone who has the capacity to pirate e-books already pirates e-books and justifies it with some other people I see who have the capacity but have some sort of weird, stupid moral whatever.

331
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:45,439
Speaker 0: They believe that they actually believe piracy is whatever.

332
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:46,800
Speaker 0: And they buy things.

333
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:50,123
Speaker 1: Seriously, this has no impact on Amazon.

334
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:53,205
Speaker 1: They have no incentive to even say anything about this.

335
00:16:53,505 --> 00:17:01,271
Speaker 1: And if they say anything, it'll have the same effect as in the proper Streisand effect where Barbra Streisand says stop talking about it.

336
00:17:01,351 --> 00:17:02,392
Speaker 1: Stop talking about it.

337
00:17:02,432 --> 00:17:04,493
Speaker 0: They should have said something before this happened.

338
00:17:04,554 --> 00:17:05,855
Speaker 1: No, they're better off saying nothing.

339
00:17:06,395 --> 00:17:07,236
Speaker 0: Better off saying something.

340
00:17:07,256 --> 00:17:07,756
Speaker 0: Being nice.

341
00:17:07,816 --> 00:17:08,577
Speaker 0: Making people love you.

342
00:17:08,696 --> 00:17:09,097
Speaker 0: No, no.

343
00:17:09,156 --> 00:17:11,398
Speaker 1: See, you're thinking about this from a human perspective.

344
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,740
Speaker 1: I'm thinking about it from an answer.

345
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:22,214
Speaker 0: I have the thesis that if a company friggin acted like a human being and wasn't an asshole, that company would be so beloved that it would be able to dominate all the other companies.

346
00:17:22,414 --> 00:17:26,540
Speaker 0: And the only reason companies don't do that is because no one else is doing it so they don't have to.

347
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,521
Speaker 1: Yeah, you think that.

348
00:17:27,662 --> 00:17:29,085
Speaker 1: Think back to PAX East.

349
00:17:29,566 --> 00:17:32,711
Speaker 1: Remember when the hotel fucked us on the charges for those flyers?

350
00:17:32,812 --> 00:17:33,112
Speaker 1: Yep.

351
00:17:33,633 --> 00:17:37,100
Speaker 1: So we still stayed at that hotel the next year.

352
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:38,760
Speaker 0: Yep.

353
00:17:38,861 --> 00:17:40,924
Speaker 0: I'm not staying at it this year.

354
00:17:41,765 --> 00:17:43,407
Speaker 1: We tried to stay at it this year.

355
00:17:43,447 --> 00:17:45,631
Speaker 1: We failed because it was too popular.

356
00:17:45,651 --> 00:17:46,692
Speaker 1: Yeah.

357
00:17:46,712 --> 00:17:50,678
Speaker 1: So what incentive does the hotel have to even talk to us?

358
00:17:50,898 --> 00:17:52,020
Speaker 0: We stopped shipping things there.

359
00:17:53,621 --> 00:17:55,806
Speaker 0: If we needed something shipped, we would ship it to a different place.

360
00:17:55,846 --> 00:17:57,449
Speaker 1: You know why hotels charge so much for that?

361
00:17:57,469 --> 00:17:58,973
Speaker 1: Because they don't want to have to deal with it at all.

362
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:02,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, but how come other hotels just let it be free and we're awesome?

363
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,622
Speaker 1: Actually, most hotels don't.

364
00:18:03,642 --> 00:18:06,728
Speaker 1: It's just that one Renaissance hotel was like the only one that doesn't charge.

365
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:10,636
Speaker 0: Man, I just watch all these old movies where the hotels provide so many awesome services.

366
00:18:10,676 --> 00:18:11,157
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what?

367
00:18:11,197 --> 00:18:12,760
Speaker 1: The hotels I stay in for business?

368
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,961
Speaker 0: Still provide those services.

369
00:18:14,021 --> 00:18:14,682
Speaker 1: Yes, and you know what?

370
00:18:14,722 --> 00:18:15,603
Speaker 1: They cost twice as much.

371
00:18:15,623 --> 00:18:16,023
Speaker 1: You know what?

372
00:18:16,103 --> 00:18:18,626
Speaker 1: If I'm traveling, I'm not staying in those fucking hotels.

373
00:18:19,106 --> 00:18:21,469
Speaker 1: The $100 a night hotel is just as good for me.

374
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:23,010
Speaker 0: Unless you need one of those services.

375
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:24,572
Speaker 1: I never need those services.

376
00:18:24,592 --> 00:18:26,594
Speaker 0: Except that time you just used the services and they fucked you.

377
00:18:26,614 --> 00:18:31,079
Speaker 1: I used it because I was lazy and also because I printed the things like three days before the con.

378
00:18:31,139 --> 00:18:32,540
Speaker 0: Alright, let's move on to the next news.

379
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,621
Speaker 1: So, in Italy.

380
00:18:33,641 --> 00:18:36,583
Speaker 0: It's me, Mario.

381
00:18:36,803 --> 00:18:40,446
Speaker 0: Let's be racist and punch out a stereotype.

382
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:44,068
Speaker 1: So, six days ago on a Tuesday, this is October 16th.

383
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:46,350
Speaker 1: Oh, no, not Tuesday.

384
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:47,371
Speaker 1: So, this is back in June.

385
00:18:47,931 --> 00:19:00,700
Speaker 1: So, in June, there's an article about some scientists in 2009 in Italy who were geologists and they analyzed data about geological things.

386
00:19:01,881 --> 00:19:08,527
Speaker 1: And they concluded in their sort of internal little like study that there wasn't much threat of an earthquake at some particular time.

387
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,229
Speaker 1: And there happened to be an earthquake that killed 300 people.

388
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:23,540
Speaker 1: So, in June of 2010, about a year later, the government talked about charging them with gross negligent manslaughter for not predicting the quake.

389
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:27,370
Speaker 0: Well, the question is, right, is did they not predict it?

390
00:19:27,711 --> 00:19:29,416
Speaker 0: or did they predict not?

391
00:19:29,677 --> 00:19:29,877
Speaker 0: Right.

392
00:19:29,897 --> 00:19:30,920
Speaker 0: See, that's the difference, right?

393
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,785
Speaker 1: Scott, there is no difference because it's all statistics and percent.

394
00:19:35,025 --> 00:19:43,435
Speaker 1: Basically, any prediction that a real scientist ever makes is just a sort of percentage coupled with a percentage that the percentage was right.

395
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:47,260
Speaker 1: And that is the only recommendation that can possibly be made.

396
00:19:47,361 --> 00:19:49,119
Speaker 0: And did they do their science proper like?

397
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:49,909
Speaker 1: Doesn't matter.

398
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:50,419
Speaker 1: Here's the other thing.

399
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,999
Speaker 0: Was it good science or was they fucked the fuck up?

400
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,628
Speaker 1: Here's the reality.

401
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:56,140
Speaker 1: It's basically impossible to predict earthquakes.

402
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,023
Speaker 0: So.

403
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,057
Speaker 0: You don't say.

404
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:03,127
Speaker 1: Anyway, that wasn't news that, you know, the government was talking about and stuff like that happens all the time.

405
00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:09,719
Speaker 1: As of today, they were found guilty of manslaughter.

406
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,080
Speaker 0: Way to go, Italy.

407
00:20:12,681 --> 00:20:13,864
Speaker 1: So I learned some things.

408
00:20:13,984 --> 00:20:21,440
Speaker 1: Apparently, Italy is one of the least productive academic countries in the entire industrialized world.

409
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:28,500
Speaker 1: The number of papers coming out of Italy from academia is lower than I believe almost any other industrialized nation.

410
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,003
Speaker 1: They're like all.

411
00:20:30,023 --> 00:20:30,806
Speaker 1: they're all the output.

412
00:20:30,826 --> 00:20:34,640
Speaker 1: I found all these articles about this is apparently academic circles talk about this a lot.

413
00:20:35,102 --> 00:20:38,139
Speaker 1: And scientists who were good have been fleeing Italy for many years.

414
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,920
Speaker 1: So there's a very anti science culture in the Italian government.

415
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,180
Speaker 0: Does this have to do anything to do with religion in Italy?

416
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,178
Speaker 1: Doesn't appear to.

417
00:20:47,483 --> 00:20:47,529
Speaker 1: OK.

418
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,000
Speaker 0: Now, obviously, this is bullshit.

419
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,400
Speaker 0: They do have lots of engineers in Italy at the Ferrari factory.

420
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,720
Speaker 1: I mean, Scott, should I sue you because you didn't predict that you were about to fart?

421
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,049
Speaker 0: No, that is obvious bullshit.

422
00:20:59,109 --> 00:21:01,520
Speaker 0: So obvious I didn't even think we needed to discuss that.

423
00:21:01,741 --> 00:21:07,020
Speaker 1: So it turns out Italy does not have a monopoly on bullshit prosecution of scientists.

424
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,296
Speaker 1: So in America, North Carolina law was passed.

425
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:13,160
Speaker 1: This was a while ago.

426
00:21:13,622 --> 00:21:15,579
Speaker 0: North Carolina is also anti intellectual.

427
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,256
Speaker 1: North Carolina is not nearly as intellectual as South Carolina.

428
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,698
Speaker 0: It's still not great.

429
00:21:23,681 --> 00:21:26,582
Speaker 1: So June 5th, 2012.

430
00:21:26,582 --> 00:21:29,679
Speaker 1: Here's an article that I remember being pissed off about this back then.

431
00:21:30,501 --> 00:21:46,580
Speaker 1: North Carolina passed a law saying that government institutions, insurance companies, all basically anyone who they could cover by laws was not allowed to use scientific analysis or extrapolation of global warming data to make predictions of any kind.

432
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:56,160
Speaker 1: Because if they did that, the insurance companies and it would probably raise insurance rates on the places that are very likely to be hit by hurricanes.

433
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,119
Speaker 0: She in a hurricane state.

434
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:11,260
Speaker 1: And the government might, you know, you might be able to assess tax values differently or they might predict that certain areas might be underwater in 10 years and that might cause property values to decline.

435
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,639
Speaker 1: So North Carolina basically passed a law that said, nah la la la, I can't hear you.

436
00:22:17,601 --> 00:22:22,140
Speaker 0: So, you know, what I would do is if I was in North Carolina is I would sell, sell, sell.

437
00:22:22,604 --> 00:22:24,039
Speaker 0: And it's basically a fake prop.

438
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,268
Speaker 1: I don't know if the law actually passed.

439
00:22:25,369 --> 00:22:25,974
Speaker 1: It was proposed.

440
00:22:26,034 --> 00:22:26,800
Speaker 1: It was very popular.

441
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:33,040
Speaker 0: But if they did it, there would basically be this fake propped up market where people were being forced to have these hot inflated prices.

442
00:22:33,441 --> 00:22:34,825
Speaker 0: I would sell like crazy.

443
00:22:34,885 --> 00:22:39,880
Speaker 0: And then when those places were literally underwater, I would be like, woo, cashing in big time.

444
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:46,280
Speaker 1: So apparently the defense in Italy, their argument was you can't predict earthquakes.

445
00:22:47,811 --> 00:22:48,059
Speaker 0: Uh huh.

446
00:22:48,463 --> 00:22:49,879
Speaker 1: It's a pretty good argument, I think.

447
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:50,664
Speaker 0: Yep.

448
00:22:51,649 --> 00:22:53,780
Speaker 0: This is a jury trial, how to trial other courts.

449
00:22:54,241 --> 00:22:55,438
Speaker 1: I have no idea how Italy works.

450
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,480
Speaker 0: Right, because in Japan it's all fucked up where like they make you confess.

451
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,079
Speaker 1: Now here's the part that bothers me.

452
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:11,600
Speaker 1: So let's say the same data had come out, you know, the same like analysis happened and they said there was going to be an earthquake and there had been a panic fleeing from the city and people died.

453
00:23:12,602 --> 00:23:14,880
Speaker 1: Would they then have been found guilty of manslaughter?

454
00:23:16,421 --> 00:23:26,820
Speaker 0: If somebody made a big to do saying there's definitely an earthquake run for your lives and there wasn't, that could be a yelling fire in a crowded theater situation.

455
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,240
Speaker 0: Alright.

456
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,080
Speaker 0: Depending on the exact circumstances of the warnings and such.

457
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:41,080
Speaker 1: What if they make the prediction with the right amount of due diligence and everything and the populace who does not understand statistics panics unduly and causes deaths?

458
00:23:42,001 --> 00:23:44,439
Speaker 0: That would not be any fault of theirs.

459
00:23:45,241 --> 00:23:49,800
Speaker 1: So what if they made a prediction that there was going to be an earthquake and there wasn't?

460
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:54,000
Speaker 1: Would they then be sued for lost tax dollars from tourism?

461
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:01,600
Speaker 0: It depends on how, if they had the yelling fire in a crowded theater situation I think is the only situation where you could get in trouble.

462
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:16,620
Speaker 1: I think the real answer is that scientists should not be able to be prosecuted for doing their science and the government needs to look at what scientists do, make decisions and deal with the consequences of those decisions.

463
00:24:18,224 --> 00:24:19,619
Speaker 1: If you're a scientist and you're in Italy.

464
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:21,744
Speaker 0: Well, they're smart.

465
00:24:21,765 --> 00:24:22,491
Speaker 0: They're already fleeing.

466
00:24:22,532 --> 00:24:23,400
Speaker 0: They don't need us to tell them.

467
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, apparently they've been fleeing for many years.

468
00:24:25,562 --> 00:24:28,880
Speaker 1: So I found some article that basically said nail plus coffin.

469
00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:31,638
Speaker 1: So yeah.

470
00:24:32,161 --> 00:24:32,857
Speaker 0: This is so sad.

471
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,870
Speaker 1: So anyway, things of the day.

472
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:41,973
Speaker 0: Time for the thing of the day.

473
00:24:42,074 --> 00:24:42,756
Speaker 0: I feel no bad.

474
00:24:42,776 --> 00:24:46,670
Speaker 0: I'm going to make fun of the elite because they are so stupid and hurting the scientists.

475
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:51,729
Speaker 1: I am a big fan of anger, also a fan of Son of Destroy, just like you.

476
00:24:53,291 --> 00:25:01,810
Speaker 1: I don't even want to talk about this beyond what I just said, but basically there is a blogspot site called fighthardyat.blogspot.com.

477
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:02,730
Speaker 0: Fight hard, yeah.

478
00:25:03,371 --> 00:25:10,940
Speaker 1: And fighthardyat, the proprietor of this fine internet establishment, sent a comment to the angry video game nerd, James Rolfe.

479
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:22,770
Speaker 1: And this is a video of him simply reading this comment out loud and he is unable to not lose his shit.

480
00:25:23,532 --> 00:25:24,620
Speaker 0: Shit all lost.

481
00:25:25,084 --> 00:25:25,850
Speaker 0: Fucks all given.

482
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:29,110
Speaker 1: He in fact lives like a Windrammer as he fucks.

483
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:36,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would tell you talk all about this fighthardyat person and tell you everything there is to know about them.

484
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:41,410
Speaker 0: But you can learn everything that I know and more by reading the blog and the Twitter if you wish to find out.

485
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:44,549
Speaker 1: So here are the top two YouTube comments on this video.

486
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:48,890
Speaker 1: One, 119 people don't see their futures in balls.

487
00:25:49,654 --> 00:25:50,709
Speaker 1: That's the number of dislikes.

488
00:25:51,811 --> 00:25:57,750
Speaker 1: Other comment, the next time James fucks it's going to be real awkward when he starts laughing his ass off uncontrollably.

489
00:25:59,472 --> 00:26:00,094
Speaker 1: Just watch this.

490
00:26:00,114 --> 00:26:03,930
Speaker 1: There's something about watching someone else trying not to laugh and laughing anyway.

491
00:26:05,171 --> 00:26:12,050
Speaker 1: And also, live like a Windrammer as you fuck is one of the greatest compliments or pieces of advice you can ever give to a human being.

492
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:17,204
Speaker 0: Okay, so there's this high school, right?

493
00:26:17,285 --> 00:26:18,830
Speaker 0: It's called Whitney Young.

494
00:26:19,451 --> 00:26:22,750
Speaker 0: I guess you can learn about it according to the YouTube comments.

495
00:26:23,393 --> 00:26:25,630
Speaker 0: It's a magnet school and whatever.

496
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:26,476
Speaker 1: I've heard of that school.

497
00:26:26,537 --> 00:26:28,290
Speaker 1: It's talked about on Fark kind of often.

498
00:26:28,691 --> 00:26:29,073
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

499
00:26:29,314 --> 00:26:32,950
Speaker 0: It seems to be a pretty cool place based on this vertical video.

500
00:26:34,311 --> 00:26:42,130
Speaker 0: But this vertical video in the content of the video, while the framing and quality is low, the content is very, very high.

501
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:45,237
Speaker 1: So it's kind of a random piece of advice.

502
00:26:45,598 --> 00:26:49,570
Speaker 1: If you ever think you should take video vertically.

503
00:26:49,791 --> 00:26:51,470
Speaker 0: I don't even know why the phones fucking let you.

504
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:56,850
Speaker 0: The phones should just always make the video sideways and then you hold it up and you'll realize.

505
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,548
Speaker 1: Aspect ratio of the sensor, that's why.

506
00:27:00,156 --> 00:27:00,549
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

507
00:27:01,451 --> 00:27:06,650
Speaker 1: If I turn the camera, the sensor is probably in a 16 by 9 configuration.

508
00:27:08,161 --> 00:27:08,370
Speaker 0: Yeah.

509
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:15,369
Speaker 1: So if I turn my HD camera sideways, it's getting video like that regardless of how it displays it.

510
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:19,150
Speaker 0: No, what it should do is it should just always.

511
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:19,722
Speaker 1: Shock you?

512
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:20,110
Speaker 1: No.

513
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,210
Speaker 1: It should just have an electric shock.

514
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:23,523
Speaker 0: It should always like this video, right?

515
00:27:23,623 --> 00:27:24,730
Speaker 0: This one is a vertical video.

516
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:25,241
Speaker 0: Yeah.

517
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:31,110
Speaker 0: If somebody, if you try to unload this from your phone, it should come out 1990 degrees rotated to the left.

518
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,349
Speaker 0: So everyone's lying on their side because you fucked up taking the video.

519
00:27:34,934 --> 00:27:35,250
Speaker 1: Anyway.

520
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:42,090
Speaker 0: Anyway, in this video, what happens is some student started with this sort of cool, funky prank.

521
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,690
Speaker 0: A totally harmless prank, the kind that everyone enjoys.

522
00:27:45,131 --> 00:27:51,890
Speaker 0: They would play music by like, you know, with improvised percussion elements like banging chairs on the floor or slapping tables.

523
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:58,990
Speaker 0: And this kid would go find people, usually teachers or other people who weren't in on it, and sort of do a little funky dance, right?

524
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,949
Speaker 0: Get up right in front of their face, do a funky dance.

525
00:28:01,151 --> 00:28:01,489
Speaker 0: All right.

526
00:28:01,871 --> 00:28:03,870
Speaker 0: And it's like you do that to someone and then walk away.

527
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,030
Speaker 0: And he'd be like, oh, that's pretty cool.

528
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:05,730
Speaker 0: That's pretty great.

529
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,228
Speaker 0: I like that.

530
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:06,992
Speaker 0: He went up to.

531
00:28:07,012 --> 00:28:11,210
Speaker 0: so he goes up and people are starting to get more excited about this as he keeps doing it more and more.

532
00:28:11,552 --> 00:28:13,210
Speaker 0: Turns into like a little mini party, right?

533
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:15,530
Speaker 0: Goes up in front of this one dude teacher.

534
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,048
Speaker 0: He looks like a teacher standing there.

535
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,430
Speaker 0: Does his funky dance.

536
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:20,029
Speaker 0: Does it so hard he loses a shoe.

537
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,730
Speaker 0: Then gets out the way because he finished doing it on that guy.

538
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,428
Speaker 1: So there's either two ways this could go.

539
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:26,070
Speaker 0: Right.

540
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:29,830
Speaker 1: Either the teacher beats the shit out of it or the teacher dances the shit out of it.

541
00:28:30,071 --> 00:28:31,079
Speaker 0: You got to see the dance.

542
00:28:31,382 --> 00:28:32,350
Speaker 0: this teacher lays out.

543
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,967
Speaker 0: I'm not going to tell you which dance it is.

544
00:28:34,951 --> 00:28:35,450
Speaker 0: And I'm not going to.

545
00:28:36,055 --> 00:28:36,870
Speaker 1: Is it Gagnam style?

546
00:28:37,112 --> 00:28:37,155
Speaker 1: No.

547
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:39,929
Speaker 0: But he I'm going to tell you which dance it not is.

548
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:41,190
Speaker 0: It not is Gagnam style.

549
00:28:42,331 --> 00:28:47,406
Speaker 0: The teacher busts out a dance and of course the students are like super awesome reaction.

550
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:48,670
Speaker 0: that makes the video worth watching.

551
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,290
Speaker 1: Do they all start dancing?

552
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:51,947
Speaker 0: It gets crazy going on.

553
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:52,457
Speaker 1: OK.

554
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:56,370
Speaker 1: So in the meta moment this weekend is the burning con.

555
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:57,988
Speaker 0: Too late to sign up.

556
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,508
Speaker 0: If you're going you're awesome not going pussy.

557
00:29:01,297 --> 00:29:02,349
Speaker 1: As a as a meta thing.

558
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:08,210
Speaker 1: Luke Crane posted a list of advice which while it is advice specifically for burning con.

559
00:29:08,731 --> 00:29:13,644
Speaker 1: If you ever run a role playing game at any convention ever a one off.

560
00:29:14,025 --> 00:29:15,790
Speaker 1: and you don't follow all of this advice.

561
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:16,750
Speaker 1: You are terrible.

562
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:18,228
Speaker 0: Read the advice.

563
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:19,889
Speaker 1: I'm going to read it because it's really quick.

564
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,709
Speaker 1: Here's a list of basic things you need.

565
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,950
Speaker 1: One an idea of the scenario or situation.

566
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,770
Speaker 0: You don't even need to know the whole fucking thing.

567
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:27,769
Speaker 0: You just need to have an idea.

568
00:29:28,211 --> 00:29:30,109
Speaker 1: Two characters provide that shit.

569
00:29:30,392 --> 00:29:32,870
Speaker 0: Yeah you don't have time to burn that shit up or roll characters.

570
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,950
Speaker 0: Provide all game materials.

571
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,849
Speaker 1: Have dice, cards, anything you need.

572
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:39,509
Speaker 0: Yeah some people don't have dice I guess.

573
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:45,050
Speaker 1: Have notes, sketches, obstacles written down already.

574
00:29:45,612 --> 00:29:46,167
Speaker 0: Oh good idea.

575
00:29:47,232 --> 00:29:50,670
Speaker 1: Have, here's the big one, have at least one twist.

576
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:55,010
Speaker 1: Something new that changes the starting dynamic but not more than three.

577
00:29:55,557 --> 00:29:56,590
Speaker 1: You find a magic sword.

578
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:57,607
Speaker 1: You must decide who gets it.

579
00:29:58,112 --> 00:30:00,050
Speaker 1: And then you have to find your way out of the dungeon.

580
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:03,810
Speaker 0: Yeah because what happens is a lot of times people make a scenario that has like an obstacle.

581
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,147
Speaker 0: Like beat the monster, we beat it.

582
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:05,875
Speaker 0: The end.

583
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:10,130
Speaker 0: You got to have something else to fill in your four hour session.

584
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:10,962
Speaker 0: Right?

585
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:11,630
Speaker 1: So.

586
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:15,190
Speaker 1: Now you could just have a really long session but then the dynamic stays the same.

587
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:15,769
Speaker 1: It gets stale.

588
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:16,370
Speaker 1: Peter's out.

589
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,450
Speaker 1: People look at their cell phones.

590
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:20,403
Speaker 0: Yeah people are going to play and then whatever they're playing goes.

591
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:25,510
Speaker 0: you need to do something to sort of restart the game as it winds down.

592
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,370
Speaker 1: So more importantly.

593
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:31,230
Speaker 0: I need to keep restarting it and putting the sparks on over and over until you get to the end of the time.

594
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:33,390
Speaker 1: Until that spark hinders the burning wheel.

595
00:30:33,752 --> 00:30:34,527
Speaker 0: And then les denommons.

596
00:30:35,071 --> 00:30:36,088
Speaker 1: Here are the things not to do.

597
00:30:36,651 --> 00:30:38,729
Speaker 1: Don't sit back and expect the players to do all the work.

598
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:39,395
Speaker 0: Duh.

599
00:30:40,611 --> 00:30:45,610
Speaker 1: Yeah say that to 99% of the people who have ever run games for me at any convention ever.

600
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:47,950
Speaker 1: Don't over prepare.

601
00:30:48,712 --> 00:30:50,410
Speaker 1: Don't plan such a detailed scenario.

602
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:51,387
Speaker 1: You'll never hope to finish it.

603
00:30:51,792 --> 00:30:54,290
Speaker 0: I almost did that by accident but then I corrected myself.

604
00:30:54,411 --> 00:30:55,449
Speaker 1: Do not setting dump.

605
00:30:55,890 --> 00:31:01,730
Speaker 1: If I catch you saying more than one minute of world or setting info I will be very angry.

606
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,410
Speaker 0: I almost did that as well and I corrected that mistake.

607
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:05,850
Speaker 1: And do not explain the rules.

608
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:06,909
Speaker 1: Demonstrate the rules.

609
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,569
Speaker 0: That is also correct.

610
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,190
Speaker 1: BurningCon is going to be great.

611
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:13,110
Speaker 1: My game is in the first slot on Saturday.

612
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:16,090
Speaker 1: It is called the Ark of Obscenities.

613
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:22,670
Speaker 1: So if you want to play in my game it is in the first session and you should try to get into my game.

614
00:31:22,711 --> 00:31:23,990
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll play in your game and crash it.

615
00:31:24,371 --> 00:31:24,906
Speaker 1: You should try.

616
00:31:25,611 --> 00:31:33,110
Speaker 1: I was told by one of the people who was in my game at the last BurningCon that it was the best game they played in at the entire BurningCon.

617
00:31:33,838 --> 00:31:34,770
Speaker 1: I was very proud of that.

618
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:39,730
Speaker 0: We'll have to compete and see whose game is better because I think mine is in the last slot on Sunday which means hardly anyone is going to be there.

619
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:40,910
Speaker 1: I should play in your game.

620
00:31:43,512 --> 00:31:45,269
Speaker 0: It's going to be a quieter game.

621
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:50,669
Speaker 1: So, Magfest is coming up in a ways.

622
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:51,530
Speaker 1: In January.

623
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:52,987
Speaker 1: Anime Boston.

624
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:55,509
Speaker 0: Even later than that.

625
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,530
Speaker 1: PAX Australia is officially officially announced.

626
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:59,607
Speaker 1: We'll probably be there.

627
00:32:01,394 --> 00:32:01,968
Speaker 1: PAX East.

628
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, three day badges sold out.

629
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:04,908
Speaker 1: We told you.

630
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:05,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, we told you.

631
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,450
Speaker 1: Single day badges are not sold out.

632
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:11,670
Speaker 1: However, the reason they are not sold out is because all the hotels are sold out.

633
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,890
Speaker 1: There are no hotels within two miles of the convention.

634
00:32:14,051 --> 00:32:17,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, now that New York Comic Con is over, there really aren't any cons until Magfest.

635
00:32:18,976 --> 00:32:20,670
Speaker 0: So, there's probably going to be more geek nights.

636
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:24,769
Speaker 0: There's going to be some American holidays and Universal holidays and things like that.

637
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:26,730
Speaker 0: There's going to be fucking snow.

638
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,990
Speaker 1: And then I'm going to go skiing every weekend.

639
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:34,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's going to be a lot of book reading and comic reading and video game and playing.

640
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:37,589
Speaker 1: The Book Club book right now is The Name of the Wind.

641
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:38,404
Speaker 1: Scott Joseph.

642
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,069
Speaker 0: By Patrick Rothfuss.

643
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:40,850
Speaker 0: Rothfuss.

644
00:32:40,991 --> 00:32:42,389
Speaker 0: I've already finished reading it.

645
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:43,500
Speaker 1: I am 21% through.

646
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,150
Speaker 0: Nice.

647
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,830
Speaker 1: I'll probably blow through it this weekend.

648
00:32:48,193 --> 00:32:50,409
Speaker 0: And you should read that shit and you should go on...

649
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,549
Speaker 1: I got to the point where shit got fucked up.

650
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:58,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, you should go on the internets and read all about us on the internets.

651
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:01,790
Speaker 1: It has a good tendency to do something that a lot of books don't do.

652
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:05,618
Speaker 1: Where it'll overstep itself and kind of tell you the aftermath of something.

653
00:33:11,952 --> 00:33:14,326
Speaker 1: And it takes you a while to realize, "Oh wait, something bad

654
00:33:14,387 --> 00:33:14,830
Speaker 1: happened.".

655
00:33:15,192 --> 00:33:17,630
Speaker 1: And then it backs up and tells you what bad happened.

656
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:20,843
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, "Yeah, that was before the Great

657
00:33:20,864 --> 00:33:21,145
Speaker 0: Cataclysm.".

658
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:26,110
Speaker 0: And then there'll be a story years before the Great Cataclysm.

659
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:28,565
Speaker 0: And they'll be like, "Yeah, five years before the Great

660
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:29,109
Speaker 0: Cataclysm.".

661
00:33:29,391 --> 00:33:32,670
Speaker 0: And they start telling the story about five years before the Great Cataclysm.

662
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,246
Speaker 0: And you're like, "What the fuck is a Great

663
00:33:34,267 --> 00:33:34,570
Speaker 0: Cataclysm?".

664
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:38,390
Speaker 0: And then eventually the story gets to the point where the Great Cataclysm happens.

665
00:33:38,531 --> 00:33:40,906
Speaker 0: And you're like, "Oh, the Great

666
00:33:40,926 --> 00:33:41,430
Speaker 0: Cataclysm.".

667
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,880
Speaker 1: Or there's a point where things are pretty happy.

668
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:46,529
Speaker 1: and then a character says something like, "Out of nowhere, in the middle of this happy story,".

669
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:53,928
Speaker 1: the character's like, "And I really hope that those people spent those last few hours

670
00:33:54,028 --> 00:33:54,309
Speaker 1: well.".

671
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:56,426
Speaker 1: And you're like, "Wait a minute, what do you mean last few

672
00:33:56,487 --> 00:33:56,790
Speaker 1: hours?".

673
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:59,570
Speaker 1: Then the next chapter is basically the fucking.

674
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:05,209
Speaker 0: It's like if the title of the book was "The Guy Named Scott Who Died in Chapter

675
00:34:05,249 --> 00:34:05,410
Speaker 0: Two.".

676
00:34:05,611 --> 00:34:09,049
Speaker 0: And then you read the book and there's a guy named Scott who dies in chapter two.

677
00:34:10,911 --> 00:34:14,710
Speaker 0: All right, so yeah, go to frontrecruit.com and click on all the things.

678
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:21,567
Speaker 1: Oh, and there's probably a new Radio Free Equestria up to celebrate the fact that the real season three is going to start in, what, 19 days?

679
00:34:22,231 --> 00:34:24,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I'm going to send out the next newsletter real soon.

680
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:35,809
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I will tell you all that because there is enough interest, we will attempt to do an episode of Radio Free Equestria after every episode of Ponies for as long as we can in season three.

681
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:42,688
Speaker 1: We have streamlined our video production process over the last year to a degree that I'm actually pretty comfortable saying that.

682
00:34:43,533 --> 00:34:45,529
Speaker 1: We got other video coming in the works, stay tuned.

683
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,770
Speaker 0: All right, so submitting to Open Source Projects.

684
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:57,930
Speaker 0: So here's the deal, we actually went into the thread on our forum that said "Show ideas and reminders" and found this idea because we're really low on Monday ideas the most compared to the other days.

685
00:34:58,832 --> 00:35:00,229
Speaker 0: And it's a good idea, I got a lot to say.

686
00:35:00,371 --> 00:35:04,010
Speaker 0: So here's the deal, is Open Source Projects out there, right?

687
00:35:04,091 --> 00:35:14,230
Speaker 0: And the idea of Open Source, if you don't know, you've been living under 10 rocks, is you have some sort of software project and people all around the world work on this project.

688
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:24,690
Speaker 0: You can just walk in, you know, do some, you know, improve the project, you know, modify it in some way and share your improvement with the other people who use and work on that project.

689
00:35:25,651 --> 00:35:32,190
Speaker 0: And, you know, then maybe it will be incorporated into the, you know, it'll be, you know, shared by everyone because it's such a good improvement.

690
00:35:33,411 --> 00:35:38,628
Speaker 0: And more people do that, the project just keeps on improving and improving and getting better all the time.

691
00:35:39,432 --> 00:35:54,470
Speaker 0: So if you encounter an Open Source Project and you have something you want to do to it or you come up with an idea or there's a bug and you want to fix it or something, how do you actually, you know, get to work on that shit?

692
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:57,129
Speaker 0: This is something a lot of people have a problem with.

693
00:35:57,454 --> 00:35:58,309
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know what?

694
00:35:59,372 --> 00:36:11,969
Speaker 1: It's kind of an aside, but we'll get back to this, but there's a much more fundamental problem in that a lot of people who have skills that many Open Source Projects really need, the one thing that those people are not is programmers.

695
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:35,390
Speaker 1: So a guy who actually, like, fully designs a specification or makes, like, a whole new awesome icon set usually has no idea how they could possibly contribute that and they need someone else to basically help them and contribute it for them to most projects because most Open Source Projects are really, really unfriendly and unresponsive to non-programmers.

696
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:44,269
Speaker 0: Yeah, the other thing is that, you know, if you're running an Open Source Project, you know, you made something, you make it Open Source, how do you handle people submitting to you, right?

697
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:53,410
Speaker 0: So basically what it comes down to is every project is different and this is why this sucks because there is no one right answer.

698
00:36:53,572 --> 00:37:08,510
Speaker 0: Every single Open Source Project in the world decides for itself what bureaucratic system to set up around who and when and which submissions and modifications are going to make it into the official build and which ones are not.

699
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:22,830
Speaker 0: And so you have to figure out whatever project you want to work on, you have to get involved with the community surrounding the project if there is one and read their documentation and talk to the people who run it and figure out how to get your stuff in there.

700
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:34,950
Speaker 0: Now, it could be a very small project, like one guy just put his thing on GitHub, in which case maybe you can just fork him on GitHub, you know, make a modification, push it to your thing, click on the GitHub pull request and you're done.

701
00:37:35,733 --> 00:37:39,368
Speaker 0: And maybe the guy will like it and he'll let it in and that's the simplest it could possibly be.

702
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:59,070
Speaker 0: But maybe you want to submit to the Linux kernel, in which case you have to get on the kernel mailing list and you have to, you know, make sure that you write your, you know, you have to git clone the kernel and you got to make your modification in just the right way and you have to, you know, write your commit message in just the right way.

703
00:37:59,454 --> 00:38:20,550
Speaker 0: You can't talk to Linus Torvalds usually, you have to talk to some lieutenant who deals with the part of the kernel that you work on and you have to email him your patch the proper way and get whoever that is lieutenant to like your commit and integrate it and make sure it works with everything else that's going on and you submit it at the right time and then if it gets incorporated, maybe it'll get in there.

704
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:21,164
Speaker 0: Maybe.

705
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:32,150
Speaker 1: Now, meanwhile, if you're, say, you know, trying to help some open source project with a horrible UI, have a new UI, you've got to find some programmer to wire up or write the UI.

706
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:37,190
Speaker 1: But at the same time, the people who write the UI usually know shit about design.

707
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:37,557
Speaker 1: Yeah.

708
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:45,386
Speaker 1: So as a result, we have this dichotomy of there are people who cannot commit anything to open source projects because you can really only submit code.

709
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:50,970
Speaker 1: Very few projects have any way for you to submit anything other than just code.

710
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:54,850
Speaker 0: Well, there are things you can do to help open source projects besides code.

711
00:38:54,931 --> 00:38:57,770
Speaker 0: For example, you can file bugs, which I do often.

712
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:58,110
Speaker 0: True.

713
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:04,210
Speaker 0: And all you have to do for that is usually find whatever bug tracking system they're using, which could be GitHub, it could be Bugzilla.

714
00:39:04,271 --> 00:39:05,330
Speaker 1: You know why I stopped doing that?

715
00:39:05,391 --> 00:39:06,129
Speaker 0: It could be Track.

716
00:39:06,751 --> 00:39:14,110
Speaker 1: Almost every bug I ever submitted to any open source project ever was responded to with a won't fix and very little communication, and then I just didn't give a shit anymore.

717
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:24,150
Speaker 0: I've had that a couple times, but usually the bugs I submit are mega bugs but they aren't important enough to actually get anyone to fix them, but they get a lot of comments and they hang around for years.

718
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:29,970
Speaker 0: I had this Ubuntu bug since like '07, and I've got a Chrome bug that's sitting around.

719
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:31,570
Speaker 1: I'll put it this way, I manage the entire QA department.

720
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:37,169
Speaker 0: And every once in a while, I get emails from these bugs that I'm still tracking because someone comments on them.

721
00:39:37,411 --> 00:39:38,930
Speaker 1: I manage the entire QA department.

722
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:43,826
Speaker 1: The one thing I've learned is that most developers fucking hate it when you give them a bug and don't want to fix it.

723
00:39:44,772 --> 00:39:47,569
Speaker 0: I don't really care if someone sends me a bug, you know, I fix it.

724
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:56,170
Speaker 1: Well, because usually the bug, it's easy to find these sort of like easy to fix bugs, but I have a knack for finding bugs that are almost impossible to fix or even replicate.

725
00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:56,771
Speaker 0: No.

726
00:39:56,791 --> 00:40:00,550
Speaker 0: See, I have a knack for finding bugs where it's hard to figure out who's responsible for them.

727
00:40:01,071 --> 00:40:02,889
Speaker 0: So there'll be arguments like, "You fix

728
00:40:02,929 --> 00:40:02,969
Speaker 0: it."

729
00:40:03,132 --> 00:40:04,045
Speaker 0: "No, your code's

730
00:40:04,066 --> 00:40:04,309
Speaker 0: broken."

731
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:05,144
Speaker 0: "No, no, no, your code's

732
00:40:05,185 --> 00:40:05,369
Speaker 0: broken.".

733
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:08,350
Speaker 0: You don't even know which project needs to be fixed, right?

734
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:13,450
Speaker 1: That's when you've got like, like in Python, you've got a Python SOAP library, but it's connecting to like some other SOAP server.

735
00:40:14,132 --> 00:40:19,710
Speaker 1: And the Python library does something one way in the SOAP request, and the server is set up to where it can't handle that.

736
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:21,090
Speaker 1: It needs a slightly different format.

737
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:23,970
Speaker 0: Well, let's say you have a problem in Ubuntu, right?

738
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:24,680
Speaker 0: For example.

739
00:40:25,571 --> 00:40:30,390
Speaker 0: Ubuntu is a combination of thousands of different open source projects all put together in one.

740
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:36,310
Speaker 0: If there's a bug in something, that bug could be in actually 20 different open source projects.

741
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:39,370
Speaker 0: There's no way to know which one really is the one that's wrong.

742
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:43,347
Speaker 0: And if, you know, all of them individually will say, "There's nothing wrong with me.

743
00:40:43,487 --> 00:40:43,889
Speaker 0: I'm doing

744
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:43,949
Speaker 0: it.".

745
00:40:44,914 --> 00:40:48,270
Speaker 0: So the bug is actually only in that particular combination.

746
00:40:48,851 --> 00:40:50,129
Speaker 1: Now that is what I was getting at.

747
00:40:50,551 --> 00:40:56,850
Speaker 1: One of the most important things, you know, software engineering as opposed to computer science, is managing like the project as a whole.

748
00:40:57,271 --> 00:41:01,630
Speaker 1: And the arbiter of this is this responsibility or that responsibility.

749
00:41:02,013 --> 00:41:03,290
Speaker 1: This class has to deal with that.

750
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:04,950
Speaker 1: This application, this service, whatever.

751
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:09,810
Speaker 0: If that person changes their piece to get that combination to work, it'll break a different legal combination.

752
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:28,829
Speaker 1: So in my experience, most people who run small to like the lower end of middling open source projects manage the whole thing themselves and they won't accept any assistance from someone who would help them manage it on that level but simultaneously desperately need someone to do that because they won't do it.

753
00:41:30,094 --> 00:41:31,450
Speaker 1: They just won't make the decision.

754
00:41:32,813 --> 00:41:35,570
Speaker 1: And then the thing languishes and the community fights over it forever.

755
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:47,690
Speaker 0: The other thing I see a lot that bothers me is some projects, usually larger, more established ones, will have very high barriers to entry for submitting things, right?

756
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:51,970
Speaker 0: Like the thing you see a lot is they won't accept something from someone they don't know.

757
00:41:52,131 --> 00:41:54,830
Speaker 0: So even if you do some great work, you're just a user.

758
00:41:55,153 --> 00:41:56,463
Speaker 0: You're not involved in their community.

759
00:41:56,503 --> 00:41:57,189
Speaker 0: You don't know them.

760
00:41:57,812 --> 00:42:05,118
Speaker 0: And you're just a user, but you also have skills and you get the code for the project and you work on it and you do something kind of awesome maybe.

761
00:42:05,219 --> 00:42:06,626
Speaker 0: Or maybe you just fixed a small bug.

762
00:42:06,666 --> 00:42:07,309
Speaker 0: Who knows what you did?

763
00:42:08,491 --> 00:42:11,189
Speaker 0: And you just send it in and say, "Hey guys, I did this

764
00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:11,370
Speaker 0: thing.".

765
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:13,298
Speaker 0: They'll just reject it because they don't know you.

766
00:42:13,318 --> 00:42:13,962
Speaker 0: Like, "Who is this?

767
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:14,525
Speaker 0: This wasn't

768
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:15,249
Speaker 0: discussed.".

769
00:42:15,973 --> 00:42:22,090
Speaker 0: It's like in order to really get something submitted, especially to a larger project, they forced you to be involved in their community.

770
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:24,630
Speaker 0: Now seriously, I have no time for that crap.

771
00:42:24,951 --> 00:42:30,270
Speaker 0: If I was involved in the communities of all the things that I use, I couldn't do anything else in my whole life.

772
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:31,437
Speaker 0: I couldn't do any geek nights.

773
00:42:31,497 --> 00:42:32,224
Speaker 0: I couldn't do video games.

774
00:42:32,244 --> 00:42:32,950
Speaker 0: I couldn't do anything, right?

775
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:35,201
Speaker 0: There'd be so many fucking communities, right?

776
00:42:35,322 --> 00:42:36,890
Speaker 0: I just don't have time to be involved in them.

777
00:42:37,151 --> 00:42:42,476
Speaker 0: If I can submit something to an open source project, it really has to be, "Here's my code.

778
00:42:42,737 --> 00:42:45,410
Speaker 0: You guys who really care about this project way more than I do.

779
00:42:46,112 --> 00:42:48,709
Speaker 0: This is the extent of the effort I'm willing to exert for you.

780
00:42:49,293 --> 00:42:50,808
Speaker 0: If you like this, you have to do the rest of the

781
00:42:50,849 --> 00:42:50,950
Speaker 0: work.".

782
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:54,670
Speaker 0: But none of them care about the code that I wrote, so that code just sits there and doesn't get in.

783
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:57,390
Speaker 1: The worst thing is you can't even just pay lip service usually.

784
00:42:57,672 --> 00:43:00,110
Speaker 1: You have to go to their forum or their mailing list.

785
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:01,845
Speaker 0: Usually it's mailing lists and IRCs.

786
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:10,130
Speaker 1: And you usually have to have unrelated conversations about generic crap because you have to be friends with them and all this.

787
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:15,665
Speaker 1: So you get to the situation where you've got this balkanized, "Let's have the same conversation about politics across 11

788
00:43:15,665 --> 00:43:15,967
Speaker 1: forums.".

789
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:17,805
Speaker 0: Now something else you can do, right?

790
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:32,649
Speaker 0: If there's a modification that they won't accept and merge or whatever into the official build, you can just, every time they put out a new release, get their updated code, merge your code in and use your own personal modified version because that's what open source is all about.

791
00:43:33,132 --> 00:43:34,148
Speaker 0: But that's just a pain in the ass.

792
00:43:35,074 --> 00:43:36,489
Speaker 1: Also, the other thing you can do is fork.

793
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:37,377
Speaker 0: Your own personal fork.

794
00:43:37,397 --> 00:43:38,450
Speaker 0: That is, your own personal fork.

795
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:40,070
Speaker 1: No, but fork it publicly and shame them.

796
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:45,210
Speaker 0: But if you make a public fork, now you're managing an open source project and now you've got to build a community.

797
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:50,230
Speaker 0: Because that's the thing, every open source project, to be successful, needs to have a community.

798
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:57,629
Speaker 0: You can't just put code out there, not have anyone managing it or having anything like that and expect it to just magically work.

799
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:01,210
Speaker 0: An open source project needs a community to succeed.

800
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:11,150
Speaker 0: So if you put code out there, if you don't start the community and no one else starts the community supporting that code, it's just going to sit there unused and unnoticed and your fork will fail.

801
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:13,550
Speaker 0: And communities also decide, right?

802
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:17,290
Speaker 0: I mean, think about X11, you know, X80, that original one, right?

803
00:44:17,591 --> 00:44:18,375
Speaker 0: Why did it fail?

804
00:44:18,616 --> 00:44:21,370
Speaker 0: Because the community moved to Xorg, right?

805
00:44:21,651 --> 00:44:23,809
Speaker 0: LibreOffice, the community moved to LibreOffice.

806
00:44:24,352 --> 00:44:26,650
Speaker 0: That's what really makes the decisions.

807
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:30,410
Speaker 0: The decisions aren't really made by the person in charge of the project.

808
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:35,510
Speaker 0: The decisions are made by which project the community endorses in the cases of forking.

809
00:44:35,972 --> 00:44:39,790
Speaker 1: And then beyond all that, there is the final barrier.

810
00:44:40,191 --> 00:44:40,977
Speaker 0: There are more barriers.

811
00:44:41,057 --> 00:44:42,650
Speaker 0: I think your barrier might not be the final one.

812
00:44:42,811 --> 00:44:47,490
Speaker 1: When I say the final, I mean the one that usually ends anyone's interest is the drama barrier.

813
00:44:47,631 --> 00:44:49,509
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, that has to do with the community again.

814
00:44:50,472 --> 00:44:58,970
Speaker 0: But the other barrier, the true final one, if you can't think of any others, right, is the projects that have high technical requirements for submitting, right?

815
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:03,810
Speaker 0: They might be willing to accept a patch from a stranger coming out of nowhere.

816
00:45:04,212 --> 00:45:21,990
Speaker 0: And they might be, your patch might be totally awesome and totally work, but they'll demand like it must fit our coding style or it must, you must write tests in our testing format and your tests had to be complete enough and have enough coverage and you have to document what you did and modify the documentation also.

817
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:25,150
Speaker 0: It's like, look, dude, I just wanted to write this code and change this icon.

818
00:45:25,471 --> 00:45:28,321
Speaker 0: Well, I think that's actually- I don't have time to write documentation and tests.

819
00:45:28,482 --> 00:45:29,470
Speaker 0: You take care of that shit.

820
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:38,470
Speaker 1: That is a subset of the more fundamental problem of without a sort of like software engineer or manager who is vested, there's a lot of pieces.

821
00:45:38,691 --> 00:45:42,990
Speaker 1: All the glue of software is the part that nobody actually wants to do.

822
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:45,790
Speaker 1: And that's the part where most open source software really starts to fall down.

823
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:49,450
Speaker 1: Like even if someone, like Scott said, you write the patch and it'll work just fine.

824
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:57,856
Speaker 1: But that last 5% of the work to make it conform and test and integrate really well takes more effort than the first 95%.

825
00:45:57,856 --> 00:45:59,109
Speaker 1: And it's boring effort.

826
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:06,385
Speaker 1: So it's almost like to have a really successful open source project that isn't big enough to where people are willing to do that.

827
00:46:06,425 --> 00:46:08,434
Speaker 1: just for the street cred is.

828
00:46:09,257 --> 00:46:18,589
Speaker 1: you almost would want to have a way where the project generates money either by donations or something and hire one developer to manage all the stuff that no one else will do.

829
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:20,442
Speaker 0: Well, usually you look at Linux, right?

830
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:30,170
Speaker 0: Most of the big submissions to Linux actually come from people who work at Red Hat, NVIDIA, IBM, places like that.

831
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:44,110
Speaker 0: Which is a huge problem because- Those companies hire people to write things, to work on the Linux kernel, but they're full paid employees of Red Hat and they submit patches to the kernel that Red Hat needs.

832
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:48,810
Speaker 0: The same way that I would submit patches to the kernel that I needed if I needed a patch to the kernel.

833
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:57,830
Speaker 1: Now the trouble is, so all right, we see that a large chunk of the patches submitted to Linux are from these basically funded developers because other people need stuff.

834
00:46:58,472 --> 00:47:04,370
Speaker 1: Companies like Red Hat and all these sort of enterprise-y Linuxes, I don't think have much of a future.

835
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:05,430
Speaker 0: Who knows?

836
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:08,090
Speaker 1: I don't think the revenue streams will exist in the long run.

837
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:19,430
Speaker 1: I mean, as a senior IT guy, a production engineer and all this stuff for all these years, there is literally no reason to use Red Hat over CentOS, ever.

838
00:47:20,872 --> 00:47:23,450
Speaker 1: But yet, how long will people pay for Red Hat?

839
00:47:23,751 --> 00:47:28,450
Speaker 1: And if people stop paying for Red Hat, then who's going to commit the code to make CentOS keep working?

840
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:31,750
Speaker 1: And as an aside, CentOS and Red Hat both.

841
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:36,290
Speaker 1: I installed an Ubuntu recently just to get a server going for some things I wanted to test in VirtualBox.

842
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:42,906
Speaker 1: Oh my god, I forgot how much I hate Red Hat and CentOS and any of that branch of Linux.

843
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:58,630
Speaker 1: Kind of an aside though, but what do we do if it turns out that some of the major open source code is actually coming out of these sort of subsidized developers, how do we get that code written if the companies that subsidize it disappear?

844
00:48:00,372 --> 00:48:01,881
Speaker 0: It's mostly just Linux has this problem.

845
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:03,550
Speaker 0: No other open source project really has this.

846
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:09,110
Speaker 1: Well that's because Linux is languishing because the desktop side of it has completely fallen behind the rest of the world.

847
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:12,570
Speaker 1: Desktop Linux is unusable unless you don't use your computer.

848
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:14,214
Speaker 0: Well, it's surprising.

849
00:48:14,695 --> 00:48:18,730
Speaker 0: In some ways, desktop Linux kicks all the ass and in some ways it fails all the fail.

850
00:48:20,892 --> 00:48:23,343
Speaker 0: But those aspects of it really don't have anything to do with the kernel.

851
00:48:23,625 --> 00:48:24,790
Speaker 0: That has to do with other things.

852
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:25,712
Speaker 1: Well here's two differences.

853
00:48:26,053 --> 00:48:32,050
Speaker 1: If my laptop were Linux and some stuff in my file system got corrupt, I could fix it with Yum.

854
00:48:32,831 --> 00:48:33,978
Speaker 1: Or Avget in this case.

855
00:48:34,723 --> 00:48:35,710
Speaker 1: But I can't do that with Windows.

856
00:48:38,751 --> 00:48:42,930
Speaker 0: So this might sound really discouraging to anyone who wants to submit to an open source project.

857
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:44,730
Speaker 0: Talking about all these barriers to entry and stuff.

858
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:49,990
Speaker 0: But the fact is, most of the projects out there aren't big scary ones.

859
00:48:51,911 --> 00:48:54,559
Speaker 0: Most of them actually are the completely deserted ones.

860
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:58,050
Speaker 0: Some guy wrote some code, he posted it on his GitHub and he doesn't pay attention to it.

861
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:04,650
Speaker 0: And if you fork it or something, nobody's going to notice if you send him a pull request because he's not even paying attention to that.

862
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:09,286
Speaker 0: So your best option is that you can take that code, look at what license it is.

863
00:49:09,366 --> 00:49:10,370
Speaker 0: Always worry about licenses.

864
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:11,758
Speaker 0: We did an episode about licenses.

865
00:49:11,778 --> 00:49:12,724
Speaker 0: You might want to go listen to it.

866
00:49:12,946 --> 00:49:13,530
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure we did.

867
00:49:13,837 --> 00:49:14,309
Speaker 0: I think we did.

868
00:49:15,433 --> 00:49:18,623
Speaker 0: Or go online and go to the OSI website and read about the licenses.

869
00:49:18,683 --> 00:49:21,030
Speaker 0: It explains all the differences between them in plain English.

870
00:49:21,231 --> 00:49:24,041
Speaker 0: And check what license each project uses before you do anything.

871
00:49:24,905 --> 00:49:26,330
Speaker 0: So you understand what you're getting into.

872
00:49:27,971 --> 00:49:38,210
Speaker 0: But yeah, if you see an abandoned project and no one's paying attention to it, really the way to submit to it is to take it and make it your project and become the guy who runs it.

873
00:49:38,691 --> 00:49:44,009
Speaker 0: Because if you try to send the patches to the guy who originally wrote it, he doesn't give a shit anymore about it.

874
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:50,442
Speaker 1: Now, while that's all well and good, I think we still have to come up with the solution to the problem of.

875
00:49:50,963 --> 00:49:54,310
Speaker 1: there are non-code resources that a lot of open source projects need.

876
00:49:54,790 --> 00:50:01,770
Speaker 1: The people best suited to doing that work are basically completely discouraged from even interacting with the community or ever submitting anything.

877
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:08,850
Speaker 0: There's no way that they just can't unless they have somebody to tag team them to help them to do the rest of the work for them.

878
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:15,647
Speaker 1: Yeah, so should open source projects that need UIs find graphic designers and try to work with them?

879
00:50:15,667 --> 00:50:16,710
Speaker 1: Because no one seems to do that.

880
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:18,509
Speaker 0: Ubuntu has an art team.

881
00:50:18,893 --> 00:50:19,390
Speaker 0: I know, Ubuntu.

882
00:50:20,353 --> 00:50:20,482
Speaker 0: I know.

883
00:50:21,855 --> 00:50:23,903
Speaker 0: If you're not, it's open source, right?

884
00:50:23,923 --> 00:50:25,590
Speaker 0: You can't force anyone to do anything.

885
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:35,110
Speaker 0: So if someone submits a patch with no documentation and no tests and it's your policy not to accept that documentation and tests and nobody wants to write documentation and tests, you can't force them.

886
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:46,370
Speaker 0: If someone sends in an icon set to make your icons look nicer and nobody wants to wire it up or cut it and forget everything in the right place, you can't make anyone do it.

887
00:50:46,390 --> 00:51:05,230
Speaker 0: There's a ticket there and it's up to someone else to of their own volition, go and make it happen or the volition of the artist who sent it to learn how to do it or join the community and see if anyone in the community will willingly help them figure it out and get the skills to do it.

888
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:05,911
Speaker 0: That's all there.

889
00:51:05,932 --> 00:51:11,250
Speaker 0: You know, if you can't force someone to do it, maybe you can pay someone with donations.

890
00:51:11,892 --> 00:51:14,470
Speaker 0: Even then, they might not do it, even though you paid the money.

891
00:51:16,893 --> 00:51:18,130
Speaker 1: It's tricky, too, because a lot of people...

892
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:19,214
Speaker 0: That's what open source is.

893
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:23,130
Speaker 0: If you don't want that, make a company and hire someone to do it.

894
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:31,708
Speaker 1: It's tricky, too, because I remember when there was a big movement to make a sort of distributed DNS system a while ago after some peer-to-peer news.

895
00:51:31,728 --> 00:51:32,510
Speaker 1: This was some years ago.

896
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:41,730
Speaker 1: So a bunch of people got together and set up this open source project to make this distributed DNS and I jumped on board to try to help these people out and work with them.

897
00:51:42,551 --> 00:51:53,730
Speaker 1: After about a week, I realized that every single person involved had no idea what they were doing and there was literally no one who was going to take over and manage the thing.

898
00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:57,110
Speaker 1: Then I just backed away and I watched the whole thing collapse.

899
00:51:57,971 --> 00:51:58,849
Speaker 0: I would have not even looked.

900
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:13,218
Speaker 1: I looked because I feel like something like that would be useful, but everyone who was involved was either someone who didn't know anything but cared about piracy or people who appeared to be developers who could probably write good code

901
00:52:13,899 --> 00:52:15,802
Speaker 0: who didn't

902
00:52:15,822 --> 00:52:21,550
Speaker 1: know anything about the project and were unwilling to let someone else dictate the architecture.

903
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:29,107
Speaker 1: So egos seem to get in the way more than anything in my own experience, but I don't submit code.

904
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:29,990
Speaker 1: I submit other things.

905
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:36,377
Speaker 1: Actually, I don't submit anything anymore, but there definitely is a particular ego problem of.

906
00:52:36,757 --> 00:52:48,530
Speaker 1: I feel like a lot of people who write software and commit to open source projects are a little resentful of people who don't write code, but have other things they could contribute getting into their playground.

907
00:52:48,951 --> 00:52:52,860
Speaker 0: Well, they're also, think about it, these are people who are actually doing work for nothing.

908
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:07,649
Speaker 0: So if their work that they did for nothing ends up being thrown away, it's like I spent two weeks on that to make this thing awesome and you guys rejected it.

909
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:09,355
Speaker 0: It's not going to get in there.

910
00:53:09,415 --> 00:53:11,484
Speaker 0: No one's going to use that code I worked so hard on.

911
00:53:11,504 --> 00:53:12,890
Speaker 0: Fuck you guys.

912
00:53:14,412 --> 00:53:30,130
Speaker 0: Even a non drama person, a chill person, you could see how with certain situations that are just necessary in the management of an open source project will cause, you know, not bad people really to, you know, do dramatic things.

913
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:33,150
Speaker 1: That happens in closed source communities.

914
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:33,430
Speaker 0: Right.

915
00:53:33,471 --> 00:53:42,510
Speaker 0: So an open source community of a significant size when you get more than a few people becomes one of the most difficult kinds of online community to manage effectively.

916
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:45,173
Speaker 0: Jono Bacon is a guy.

917
00:53:45,193 --> 00:53:46,776
Speaker 0: He's in a metal band.

918
00:53:46,796 --> 00:53:53,630
Speaker 0: He's from the UK and his job title is, I believe it still is community manager at Ubuntu.

919
00:53:54,291 --> 00:53:54,688
Speaker 1: Ubuntu.

920
00:53:55,612 --> 00:53:57,636
Speaker 0: So he's the top community guy at Ubuntu.

921
00:53:57,696 --> 00:54:00,603
Speaker 0: He wrote a book that you can get for free Creative Commons ish.

922
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:03,970
Speaker 0: You can also pay for it, I think, called The Art of Community.

923
00:54:04,611 --> 00:54:12,702
Speaker 0: And it pretty much has the instructions on how to manage an open source community or an online community in general down to the like ditty details of like.

924
00:54:12,982 --> 00:54:18,950
Speaker 0: you should ban a person from a forum if this and manage your IRC like that and all that stuff.

925
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:22,910
Speaker 1: We did a lecture like that, but it was more about like communities around games.

926
00:54:23,331 --> 00:54:24,353
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was more.

927
00:54:24,613 --> 00:54:24,894
Speaker 0: Yeah.

928
00:54:25,775 --> 00:54:28,300
Speaker 0: But yeah, you should check out that book if there's something really appeals to you.

929
00:54:28,721 --> 00:54:33,650
Speaker 0: But if you're an open source person or if you want to get involved in open source and this whole thing has scared you a fuck ton.

930
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:34,954
Speaker 0: Here's just do what I tell you.

931
00:54:35,455 --> 00:54:38,243
Speaker 0: Find the project on GitHub that people are actually working on.

932
00:54:38,283 --> 00:54:40,550
Speaker 0: And the way you can tell is if it's had commits recently.

933
00:54:40,711 --> 00:54:43,070
Speaker 1: Now, it has to also be a project that you care about somehow.

934
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:46,713
Speaker 0: And there's something that you want to change on it that you're capable of changing.

935
00:54:47,354 --> 00:55:02,327
Speaker 0: Just click the fork button, clone the code, you know, make your change in your fix, push it back to GitHub and use the pull request button and just stick to working on projects that use GitHub pull requests, at least for the near future.

936
00:55:02,367 --> 00:55:05,310
Speaker 0: to when this podcast was made before, you know, GitHub dies.

937
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:06,151
Speaker 0: Something replaces.

938
00:55:06,251 --> 00:55:06,512
Speaker 1: Yeah.

939
00:55:06,932 --> 00:55:12,499
Speaker 0: Learn how to use Git properly and just commit to projects that are that scale that work that way.

940
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:19,648
Speaker 0: And if you really want to submit to some other project that has its own thing, you just had to get involved in the community for that project.

941
00:55:19,668 --> 00:55:20,790
Speaker 0: There's no way around it.

942
00:55:22,171 --> 00:55:26,183
Speaker 0: The same way you should get involved in like the community because you don't have to submit anything.

943
00:55:26,243 --> 00:55:26,966
Speaker 0: There's less drama.

944
00:55:27,889 --> 00:55:28,290
Speaker 0: No drama.

945
00:55:28,731 --> 00:55:30,554
Speaker 1: Oh, I just I've read the XKC for today.

946
00:55:30,574 --> 00:55:31,275
Speaker 1: It's about drama.

947
00:55:31,856 --> 00:55:32,236
Speaker 0: Oh, how about?

948
00:55:32,256 --> 00:55:33,278
Speaker 1: the graphics didn't correct, though?

949
00:55:33,959 --> 00:55:34,200
Speaker 0: Nice.

950
00:55:34,721 --> 00:55:40,290
Speaker 1: It says that the rate at which people create drama is proportional to often they declare the hate drama and always avoid it.

951
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:44,413
Speaker 0: Oh, no, because I hate drama and always avoid it.

952
00:55:44,453 --> 00:55:45,515
Speaker 0: How much drama do I create?

953
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:47,797
Speaker 0: Unless how much drama do you think I got?

954
00:55:47,918 --> 00:55:53,745
Speaker 1: So what I'm saying is there's a possibility that you and I are, in fact, like revenants in the.

955
00:55:53,785 --> 00:55:55,066
Speaker 0: well, you know, that could be.

956
00:55:55,206 --> 00:55:56,448
Speaker 0: that could be one looking at the.

957
00:55:56,468 --> 00:55:58,050
Speaker 1: because here's the here's the revenues work, right?

958
00:55:58,890 --> 00:55:59,271
Speaker 0: No, no.

959
00:55:59,351 --> 00:56:01,896
Speaker 1: In an interview with a vampire.

960
00:56:01,936 --> 00:56:07,268
Speaker 1: So if I if I'm a vampire, so they were vampires, I bite someone and I have them drink my blood.

961
00:56:07,308 --> 00:56:08,290
Speaker 1: They become a vampire, too.

962
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:10,132
Speaker 0: Wait, you have them drink your blood?

963
00:56:10,172 --> 00:56:10,273
Speaker 0: Yeah.

964
00:56:10,293 --> 00:56:11,074
Speaker 1: You got to do a thing.

965
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:12,477
Speaker 1: If I just bite someone, leave them.

966
00:56:13,018 --> 00:56:17,265
Speaker 1: They turn into this mindless vampire that goes around killing people and you leave them behind.

967
00:56:17,285 --> 00:56:19,910
Speaker 1: So you leave behind this trail of bullshit.

968
00:56:20,512 --> 00:56:27,570
Speaker 1: It is possible that we do, in fact, cause a lot of drama, but only in the people we leave behind or pass by.

969
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:29,654
Speaker 0: See, I'm thinking you look at remember Otacon.

970
00:56:30,876 --> 00:56:31,597
Speaker 0: Look at this graph.

971
00:56:31,678 --> 00:56:34,804
Speaker 0: This is clearly, you know, not a straight plot.

972
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:38,090
Speaker 0: This is one of those ones where you scatter plot and then you draw the line.

973
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:38,972
Speaker 1: You're saying we're down here.

974
00:56:39,072 --> 00:56:40,896
Speaker 0: This is where we're one of those dots.

975
00:56:40,976 --> 00:56:42,159
Speaker 0: that's way outlying.

976
00:56:42,259 --> 00:56:42,880
Speaker 0: But we're just.

977
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:45,506
Speaker 0: you know, the dots aren't on this rendering of the graph.

978
00:56:45,746 --> 00:56:47,570
Speaker 1: because remember, we were in the Otacon staff.

979
00:56:47,831 --> 00:56:50,877
Speaker 1: We quit basically because of all the drama around us.

980
00:56:51,178 --> 00:56:52,280
Speaker 0: And we don't have zero.

981
00:56:52,341 --> 00:56:56,590
Speaker 1: I'm not going to say we have zero drama, but I'm saying we left behind a hornet's nest of drama.

982
00:56:56,931 --> 00:56:58,695
Speaker 1: But none of it actually involved us.

983
00:56:58,755 --> 00:56:59,517
Speaker 1: We just left it there.

984
00:56:59,537 --> 00:57:01,101
Speaker 0: That hornet's nest was already hornet's nest.

985
00:57:01,121 --> 00:57:05,010
Speaker 1: Well, I guess us walking in disturbed it and then we left and it's still disturbed.

986
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:05,752
Speaker 0: We didn't disturb it that much.

987
00:57:05,772 --> 00:57:06,875
Speaker 0: It's always been disturbed.

988
00:57:06,935 --> 00:57:08,420
Speaker 1: I think it's more disturbed.

989
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:12,030
Speaker 0: Like two or three wasps got a little bit more pissed off.

990
00:57:12,491 --> 00:57:12,772
Speaker 1: I don't know.

991
00:57:12,832 --> 00:57:20,849
Speaker 1: I learned recently that apparently a bunch of people within that still specifically hold a grudge and in fact talk about it whenever even unprompted.

992
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:22,392
Speaker 0: Okay.

993
00:57:22,472 --> 00:57:23,775
Speaker 1: I learned about this a few days ago.

994
00:57:23,795 --> 00:57:24,999
Speaker 0: How do you know this is true?

995
00:57:25,019 --> 00:57:26,683
Speaker 1: I trust the person who told me.

996
00:57:27,585 --> 00:57:29,350
Speaker 0: It's such evidence that it's so strong.

997
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:30,652
Speaker 1: I trust the person.

998
00:57:30,672 --> 00:57:35,120
Speaker 1: I mean, if someone lies to me about this, that is also drama.

999
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:36,282
Speaker 0: That's what I'm talking about.

1000
00:57:36,302 --> 00:57:37,304
Speaker 0: So either one.

1001
00:57:37,444 --> 00:57:40,570
Speaker 0: But that's the exact kind of thing a drama person would say.

1002
00:57:40,751 --> 00:57:41,513
Speaker 1: Exactly.

1003
00:57:41,774 --> 00:57:45,930
Speaker 1: So there is drama regardless of whether or not they lie, therefore there is drama.

1004
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,546
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1005
00:57:53,586 --> 00:57:58,580
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1007
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,907
Speaker 1: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

1008
00:58:07,047 --> 00:58:11,640
Speaker 1: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.
