00:00:40,067 --> 00:00:40,970
Speaker 1: perhaps a bike ride?

11
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:42,469
Speaker 0: No, none of that.

12
00:00:43,575 --> 00:00:46,822
Speaker 0: so, you know that You know certain things.

13
00:00:46,903 --> 00:00:50,520
Speaker 0: it's like we're not Completely out of things here, right?

14
00:00:50,601 --> 00:00:52,570
Speaker 0: It's like if you need TP you can get TP.

15
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:58,978
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I just ordered a giant crate of TP from a restaurant supply company, right worst case You can get some low-quality stuff, right?

16
00:00:58,998 --> 00:01:01,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the grocery store has almost everything in stock still.

17
00:01:02,331 --> 00:01:09,848
Speaker 0: Yeah, but one thing that you know, we can get but we can't get the good stuff is paper towel, right?

18
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:23,834
Speaker 1: Oh So that you know, I do have stuff to say because we way back bought some super organic compostable like easily degraded like environmentally friendly paper towel and It was so bad.

19
00:01:23,874 --> 00:01:24,596
Speaker 1: It was unusable.

20
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:28,189
Speaker 1: Like if you got it wet, it just disintegrated into nothing.

21
00:01:29,377 --> 00:01:32,750
Speaker 0: So yeah, we bought some paper towel.

22
00:01:33,532 --> 00:01:39,189
Speaker 0: That was some shady ass brand and you could tell right out of the package that it was flimsy and thin.

23
00:01:39,832 --> 00:01:43,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was going to pat dry some some meats, right?

24
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,670
Speaker 0: And the paper towel came apart and like disintegrated into the meat like a seasoning.

25
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,650
Speaker 0: So that happened with a soggy paper towels on my meats that I had to pick off with my fingers.

26
00:01:53,353 --> 00:01:57,088
Speaker 1: I used a fork to like scrape it off because it was embedded in the meat.

27
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:01,370
Speaker 1: We might have used the same shitty toilet paper paper paper towel.

28
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,896
Speaker 0: You're using toilet paper.

29
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:04,563
Speaker 0: that explains why you're disintegrated.

30
00:02:04,743 --> 00:02:06,028
Speaker 0: that explains all your problems.

31
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:09,710
Speaker 1: Yep It was that paper towel definitely paper towel.

32
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:15,768
Speaker 1: that paper towel was so bad really shitty that we put it aside bought entirely new paper towel and I kept it.

33
00:02:15,828 --> 00:02:22,490
Speaker 1: the sole thing I Was gonna use it for was to like clean up grease spills when I'm working on my bike or something like that.

34
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,631
Speaker 1: Like.

35
00:02:22,691 --> 00:02:25,230
Speaker 1: I was just gonna use it for like garbage tasks.

36
00:02:25,832 --> 00:02:26,716
Speaker 1: But then this happened.

37
00:02:26,957 --> 00:02:30,030
Speaker 1: and guess what paper towel I've been using in the kitchen off and on the shitty one.

38
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:35,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got to get some more of the good stuff because the shitty stuff is like it's just not working.

39
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:36,917
Speaker 0: Yeah, the worst thing is not like.

40
00:02:36,937 --> 00:02:37,600
Speaker 0: that's like.

41
00:02:37,701 --> 00:02:41,556
Speaker 0: it's a pretty first-world problem, obviously but it's still.

42
00:02:41,636 --> 00:02:49,239
Speaker 0: it's like the difference between the good stuff and the not good stuff was More extreme than you would expect.

43
00:02:50,123 --> 00:02:51,510
Speaker 0: I mean, it's notably different.

44
00:02:51,992 --> 00:02:59,036
Speaker 1: I would believe that because it's not a matter of like, oh this one's nicer, but the environmentally friendly one is Nice enough but does the job?

45
00:02:59,116 --> 00:03:01,003
Speaker 1: it's like it doesn't even do the job.

46
00:03:01,023 --> 00:03:03,230
Speaker 1: You're better off having nothing, right?

47
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,849
Speaker 0: It's not like oh, yeah, I can get to work in a Honda Civic or a BMW.

48
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:13,370
Speaker 0: This is like imagine if you know a BMW drove and a Honda Civic like lost a wheel on the way to work.

49
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:14,334
Speaker 0: That's what this is.

50
00:03:14,615 --> 00:03:14,857
Speaker 1: Yeah.

51
00:03:14,877 --> 00:03:15,017
Speaker 1: Yeah.

52
00:03:15,118 --> 00:03:21,710
Speaker 1: Well, I could see you can use cheap toilet paper But the Wegmans one-ply doesn't really qualify as toilet paper.

53
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,576
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not great.

54
00:03:24,777 --> 00:03:30,903
Speaker 1: I think at that point you're better off just taking a shower every time you Do your business and let's what if you're not at home?

55
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,075
Speaker 1: Uh Don't know what you do.

56
00:03:33,115 --> 00:03:41,310
Speaker 1: then if your only option is when the Wegmans one-ply Use the underwear and bail That might be a better option Alright.

57
00:03:43,874 --> 00:03:44,837
Speaker 1: So, uh, there is.

58
00:03:44,917 --> 00:03:45,820
Speaker 1: there's a little bit of news.

59
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,689
Speaker 1: I think you had a news first about some HBO anime biz going on.

60
00:03:49,672 --> 00:03:50,915
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not a huge news.

61
00:03:50,995 --> 00:03:56,670
Speaker 0: But basically HBO max, which I guess is like HBO is the most confusing streaming service.

62
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:01,250
Speaker 0: I don't use any of their stuff, but they have like HBO go HBO now HBO max.

63
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:06,650
Speaker 0: It's like all these different services for people who are or are not paying for HBO on cable television.

64
00:04:07,911 --> 00:04:17,857
Speaker 0: And I guess from what I understand I could be wrong about this because it's so confusing as the HBO max is basically, then Netflix competitor of HBO.

65
00:04:17,937 --> 00:04:18,738
Speaker 0: I mean just pay for it.

66
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,363
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna lie HBO.

67
00:04:20,464 --> 00:04:23,988
Speaker 1: Anything is a Yarr situation for me.

68
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:30,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much HBO match new streaming platform a twelve dollars a month, right?

69
00:04:32,132 --> 00:04:42,090
Speaker 0: So the news is sort of a Wednesday news that HBO max is going to be Partnering with the crunchyroll and is going to include a handful of crunchyroll anime.

70
00:04:42,231 --> 00:04:44,870
Speaker 0: Not all of them like 17 of them, right?

71
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,937
Speaker 0: But basically the 17 top ones.

72
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:55,003
Speaker 0: so it's like if you're the kind of person who is an anime nerd You need the crunchyroll because you're gonna be watching stuff that like normal people do not.

73
00:04:55,404 --> 00:04:57,070
Speaker 0: yeah watch ever, right?

74
00:04:57,771 --> 00:05:04,230
Speaker 0: But if you are a person who just watches an occasional anime, you know that the big ones right.

75
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,299
Speaker 0: Netflix has sort of been killing in that department.

76
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,890
Speaker 1: I mean Netflix has like all the great anime.

77
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,134
Speaker 1: They're out like you want to watch Beastars Like anything.

78
00:05:13,154 --> 00:05:16,450
Speaker 0: well, that's a Netflix made anime, but they got like, you know, they got one punch man.

79
00:05:16,591 --> 00:05:17,659
Speaker 0: They got I don't know for some reason.

80
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:19,070
Speaker 0: They don't have season 2 of one punch, man.

81
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:21,576
Speaker 0: They got that ghost in the shells.

82
00:05:21,616 --> 00:05:23,463
Speaker 0: They got you know, a lot of the top animes.

83
00:05:23,503 --> 00:05:36,738
Speaker 0: the evangelicals are on the Netflix Whether Netflix makes them or not, but HBO go or HBO max, whatever the hell It's gonna have the top crunchyroll ones.

84
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:40,230
Speaker 0: So now it's like ah, you know, it's like the Disney Plus.

85
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,381
Speaker 0: They don't have any animes on there, right?

86
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:48,190
Speaker 0: It's like a no anime zone Right Hulu, I think has a lot of animes actually.

87
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:53,183
Speaker 0: But that's basically I guess the reason Disney Plus doesn't because that's also a Disney thing Hulu, right?

88
00:05:54,206 --> 00:06:00,521
Speaker 1: I This point what I pay for is Netflix crunchyroll Disney Plus and nothing else.

89
00:06:01,343 --> 00:06:01,484
Speaker 0: Yeah.

90
00:06:01,504 --> 00:06:06,966
Speaker 0: I mean, that's what I have right now - But we're not paying for the Disney Plus or really using it.

91
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:14,697
Speaker 1: We're using it cuz we have it for free watching like all the old Disney movies and randomly We watched this old Disney documentary about a squirrel.

92
00:06:14,738 --> 00:06:17,146
Speaker 1: that was better than I expected.

93
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:18,774
Speaker 0: Okay, sure.

94
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:37,690
Speaker 0: Anyway, so yeah, if you're the kind of person who wants to watch HBO stuff right, this makes HBO max like something that you wouldn't think of as like, you know, like an actual Well, you think of it as like a tier below the Netflix of the Disney Plus in terms of like streaming services

95
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,857
Speaker 1: Which it is still a tier below like.

96
00:06:39,877 --> 00:06:42,285
Speaker 0: let's not but it but it almost gets it there.

97
00:06:42,345 --> 00:06:50,517
Speaker 1: It's almost like hey Well also remember HBO max is where the new Further adventure times are going to be.

98
00:06:50,537 --> 00:06:55,831
Speaker 1: Oh, that's interesting adventure time distant lands for one hour long Specials.

99
00:06:56,454 --> 00:06:59,246
Speaker 0: Well, I'm sure we can find those on the high seas somewhere.

100
00:06:59,266 --> 00:07:03,338
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah the special like.

101
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:10,490
Speaker 1: we haven't really paid attention to it because it was Intended to be released in 2020 and we don't actually know a lot about them.

102
00:07:10,872 --> 00:07:14,490
Speaker 1: The only thing I remember that we knew I think we even talked about this is there are four episodes.

103
00:07:14,974 --> 00:07:23,401
Speaker 1: They are called in order be mo obsidian wizard city and Together again and suppose all about that wizard city.

104
00:07:23,602 --> 00:07:24,365
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

105
00:07:24,746 --> 00:07:25,790
Speaker 0: Oh, oh this much.

106
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,196
Speaker 1: You know what the plot of that one is.

107
00:07:27,658 --> 00:07:32,077
Speaker 1: peppermint butler goes to school to relearn magic Sounds good to me.

108
00:07:32,178 --> 00:07:33,649
Speaker 1: I am down with that.

109
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:38,387
Speaker 1: Obsidian is princess bubblegum and Marceline meditate on their relationship on a mission.

110
00:07:38,407 --> 00:07:41,741
Speaker 0: be mo You know, I have almost every adventure time comic.

111
00:07:41,801 --> 00:07:42,745
Speaker 0: Have you read any of those?

112
00:07:42,806 --> 00:07:43,710
Speaker 1: I read a bunch of them.

113
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:50,510
Speaker 1: Yeah The last one a quest reconnects Finn the human and Jake the dog.

114
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:54,789
Speaker 1: I guess they go their separate ways at some point and be mo be mo journeys to space.

115
00:07:56,392 --> 00:08:03,003
Speaker 1: We know from the end of adventure time that be mo must come back from space at some point sure But I guess be mo goes to space.

116
00:08:03,345 --> 00:08:27,230
Speaker 1: So, uh, yeah HBO max may have a little bit of a thing going on but this anime news in particular I think will be good for anime as a whole because I think and I see there are a lot of people who Kind of know of anime but are not really anime fans who have ended up watching things like Castlevania or Beastars just because it's on Netflix and Netflix like recommends it to them next to other stuff.

117
00:08:27,754 --> 00:08:29,670
Speaker 1: I feel like HBO max will be a similar situation.

118
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:36,928
Speaker 1: I think you're gonna see a lot of people who will like bump into Fullmetal Alchemist be like Isn't that that anime thing and watch a little bit and get into it?

119
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:42,748
Speaker 0: Maybe I wonder if anyone will like start like discover anime from HBO max or Netflix.

120
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,590
Speaker 1: I mean, how did I just go to crunchyroll?

121
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,995
Speaker 1: Cuz how did I discover anime?

122
00:08:47,035 --> 00:08:47,175
Speaker 1: like?

123
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:51,270
Speaker 1: literally just it was on the sci-fi network one day and I was like, what's this cartoon?

124
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:53,134
Speaker 0: Pretty much.

125
00:08:53,154 --> 00:08:54,179
Speaker 1: Yeah people younger than us.

126
00:08:54,259 --> 00:09:00,570
Speaker 1: It was just like on Cartoon Network like hey There's the regular cartoons and then there's this good cartoon every day at four o'clock for some reason.

127
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,233
Speaker 1: What's up with that?

128
00:09:01,253 --> 00:09:04,485
Speaker 0: pretty sure people are though or these days are discovering it from internet.

129
00:09:05,008 --> 00:09:12,669
Speaker 1: Yeah, but There are still a terrifying number of not that internet people Sure, so some other news.

130
00:09:13,671 --> 00:09:17,948
Speaker 1: You know, we hate cars, but this the story is wouldn't would be funny if it wasn't so sad.

131
00:09:17,968 --> 00:09:22,734
Speaker 1: So Philadelphia is Basically the poor.

132
00:09:22,754 --> 00:09:27,950
Speaker 1: it one of the poorest large cities and I think it's the poorest and least funded large city in America.

133
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,344
Speaker 0: Like Philly is huge, but you got Detroit.

134
00:09:30,948 --> 00:09:38,710
Speaker 0: God Philly's bigger than Detroit because Detroit collapse Sure, but you got places like, you know mobile, Alabama.

135
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:39,894
Speaker 1: Those are small cities.

136
00:09:40,075 --> 00:09:41,119
Speaker 1: or relatively small city.

137
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:44,030
Speaker 1: Philly's actually a pretty huge city like in terms of population.

138
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:46,301
Speaker 1: There's a lot of things going on with the Philly.

139
00:09:46,341 --> 00:09:48,010
Speaker 1: Philly is a big deal in that regard.

140
00:09:49,211 --> 00:09:50,899
Speaker 1: Don't worry about shit all over Philly cuz.

141
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:56,829
Speaker 1: Philly's got some problems but Philly has Compared to if you would pretend New York City does not exist.

142
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:00,387
Speaker 1: Philly has one of the better mass transit systems in America.

143
00:10:00,508 --> 00:10:07,929
Speaker 1: now again I have to stress that's that's like saying oh one of the least smelly diarrhea Is it if you get pooped on by like 10 really awful animals?

144
00:10:09,051 --> 00:10:15,389
Speaker 1: But one of those animals is like relatively clean like a rabbit pooping on you is way preferable to like a cat pooping on you.

145
00:10:16,312 --> 00:10:27,911
Speaker 1: But if the rabbit doesn't exist New York City being the rabbit then you've got your choice of many Terrifying animals to poop on you, but Philly pretending your doesn't exist pretty good transit system Like.

146
00:10:27,932 --> 00:10:28,961
Speaker 1: they actually have a subway.

147
00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:32,517
Speaker 1: They have a bunch of light rail They have a really extensive bus network and a lot of people use it.

148
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:42,495
Speaker 1: However, that transit system is going completely broke Right now like way worse than normal way worse than the MTA Makes sense.

149
00:10:42,535 --> 00:10:43,901
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you want to know why.

150
00:10:44,423 --> 00:10:49,550
Speaker 1: like the specific riding it No one's riding it, but that would be fine because it's got other forms of funding.

151
00:10:49,852 --> 00:10:52,148
Speaker 1: In fact people riding it barely funds it.

152
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:57,086
Speaker 1: It's funding comes primarily from tolls on the Pennsylvania turnpike.

153
00:10:57,106 --> 00:11:01,858
Speaker 1: because Philly and Pennsylvania Were actually smart they fund their transit system.

154
00:11:01,878 --> 00:11:08,290
Speaker 1: that can't be funded by the local population because the local population is relatively poor per capita But the transit system is necessary.

155
00:11:08,713 --> 00:11:10,950
Speaker 1: They tax cars to fund transit.

156
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:24,200
Speaker 1: However, because no one is driving on the Pennsylvania turnpike that now the transit system despite actually being used significantly by First-responders and critical workers has no money because it can't never

157
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:31,299
Speaker 0: understood why states it seems like every state does this right where they have Specific taxes tied to specific expenses.

158
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:34,950
Speaker 0: I feel like wouldn't it just make sense to have all taxes go into a common pile of money?

159
00:11:36,058 --> 00:11:36,279
Speaker 0: I can.

160
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:37,790
Speaker 0: I would then be budgeted out.

161
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,394
Speaker 1: I can tell you exactly why that.

162
00:11:39,434 --> 00:11:51,734
Speaker 1: the reason why what you just suggested is not the case anywhere in America anymore Nor is it the case pretty much anywhere in the world is because of specific corruption in the old that you know The term slush fund.

163
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:55,230
Speaker 1: just don't be fucking corrupt that you're talking to America.

164
00:11:55,933 --> 00:12:00,470
Speaker 1: How hard is our Supreme Court just ruled that it is not technically illegal to be corrupt.

165
00:12:00,995 --> 00:12:12,034
Speaker 1: That's just because we didn't make laws The convictions with the corruption law because the law wasn't enough to cover this exact Specific kind of corruption.

166
00:12:12,235 --> 00:12:29,741
Speaker 1: the reason the law is not good enough the reason why every municipality in America will take specific tax dollars and say they can be only used for specific purposes is because every time Anywhere in America has ever had general funds The general funds are used to cause evil.

167
00:12:30,222 --> 00:12:32,490
Speaker 1: every time hundred percent evil embezzlement.

168
00:12:32,811 --> 00:12:38,150
Speaker 1: They'll just like cuz then you have like a mayor or a governor or like some city official who's corrupt.

169
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:40,180
Speaker 1: We'll just be like, yeah, I just won't fund the schools.

170
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:40,562
Speaker 1: Fuck you.

171
00:12:41,326 --> 00:12:42,110
Speaker 0: No, you can't do that.

172
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,733
Speaker 0: There's a budget.

173
00:12:42,773 --> 00:12:44,683
Speaker 0: you have to money from the general fund has.

174
00:12:44,724 --> 00:12:48,570
Speaker 0: you has to be given out Proportionally to all of the things that are expensive.

175
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:52,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, so they just set the percentage to zero and there's no law that prevents them from doing that.

176
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:56,090
Speaker 0: No, the percentage should be set in law when you vote on the budget.

177
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,730
Speaker 1: Yeah Here's the other problem.

178
00:12:58,951 --> 00:13:05,289
Speaker 1: you know all all the laws that get passed to force balance but battles budgets or to force minimum levels of funding.

179
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:13,049
Speaker 1: the reason those fail is because the municipalities are literally incapable of raising that much money and end up having constitutional crises like every time.

180
00:13:13,109 --> 00:13:23,089
Speaker 0: and then The law should also say yeah, if you don't have enough money all taxes go up Proportionally equally on all things and that also doesn't work for a bunch of other reasons.

181
00:13:24,135 --> 00:13:24,317
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

182
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:33,350
Speaker 1: I think that does work Now because the taxes would have to go up specifically only on rich people or you end up driving people out of their town.

183
00:13:33,532 --> 00:13:37,088
Speaker 0: In fact, I've seen situations Should be on rich people.

184
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:45,710
Speaker 1: Yeah but that's that would never pass because stupid people the only thing stupid people care about more than Themselves is making sure that rich people remain rich.

185
00:13:46,614 --> 00:13:52,504
Speaker 1: well So yeah, Philly's transit system that cannot sell fund and the state refuses to fund.

186
00:13:52,764 --> 00:14:00,890
Speaker 1: the state actually did fund by pet taxing cars But now because cars are gone the transit system that is actually still being used in crucial cannot actually be funded.

187
00:14:01,872 --> 00:14:04,170
Speaker 1: Burma shave the aristocrats.

188
00:14:06,575 --> 00:14:24,499
Speaker 1: So in another really brief news We talked about this on Tuesday that game Valorant the counter-strike II overwatch II like new game coming out from riot As we mentioned it has this dodgy anti-cheat software that is provided by Tencent, which is a giant Probably dodgy Chinese conglomerate.

189
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:37,130
Speaker 1: I don't want to get into all the reasons why I don't trust that company, but There are now a lot of confirmed reports of that malware and anti cheating software causing all sorts of chaos in people's PCs.

190
00:14:38,131 --> 00:14:39,617
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean that was from the start.

191
00:14:39,657 --> 00:14:41,966
Speaker 0: people were saying that you know, this looks like trouble.

192
00:14:42,046 --> 00:14:52,630
Speaker 0: and then afterwards There were several stories of trouble and I guess it's hard to tell which stories are real and which ones aren't Especially because you have people who don't know technology complaining about stuff.

193
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,758
Speaker 0: It could just be some dude installed it.

194
00:14:54,798 --> 00:14:59,919
Speaker 0: then his computer exploded and he's like, oh you see it was the The Chinese government.

195
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:09,650
Speaker 1: remember remember when our neighbors when we were in college Called campus safety on us because they said we were hacking them because our IPX network frames were being picked up by their firewall.

196
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:12,270
Speaker 1: Sure, like that kind of shit happened.

197
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:19,750
Speaker 1: So here's an article that finally actually breaks down these specific Concerns and issues that people are raising about this software.

198
00:15:20,393 --> 00:15:27,946
Speaker 1: so I'm probably not going to play Valorant or even try it despite the fact that the game actually looks okay, and I'm interested in it.

199
00:15:27,966 --> 00:15:30,175
Speaker 0: I Wouldn't play it.

200
00:15:30,337 --> 00:15:31,650
Speaker 0: I wouldn't play any right game.

201
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,756
Speaker 0: Well, it's right is basically in the market of.

202
00:15:34,378 --> 00:15:38,690
Speaker 0: look at popular genres of game on PC and make one of those.

203
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:41,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, just apply their own stuff to it.

204
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:42,103
Speaker 0: It's like oh, we'll make a mo.

205
00:15:42,244 --> 00:15:43,770
Speaker 0: There's a moba called dota out there.

206
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,272
Speaker 0: We'll make one.

207
00:15:44,312 --> 00:15:45,236
Speaker 0: We'll call League of Legends.

208
00:15:45,397 --> 00:15:48,510
Speaker 1: Oh and it ended up being more like the bigger one really, right?

209
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:51,300
Speaker 0: And now they're basically saying oh look, there's an auto chess.

210
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,123
Speaker 0: We'll make one of those.

211
00:15:52,224 --> 00:15:53,047
Speaker 0: Oh, there's FPS.

212
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:53,790
Speaker 0: We'll make one of those.

213
00:15:54,092 --> 00:15:55,301
Speaker 0: It's like any game that's out there.

214
00:15:55,342 --> 00:15:56,289
Speaker 0: They're gonna make one of those.

215
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:59,082
Speaker 0: Yeah, but as a gamer is nothing original that they make.

216
00:15:59,142 --> 00:16:00,850
Speaker 0: they don't do anything original at all.

217
00:16:01,671 --> 00:16:05,164
Speaker 1: But I mean at the same time counter-strike kind of just action.

218
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:06,329
Speaker 1: quick too, but slower.

219
00:16:07,511 --> 00:16:11,487
Speaker 0: Counter-strike was at least original in that.

220
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:19,730
Speaker 1: What about counter-strike source and then counter-strike go and then whatever the next counter-strike will be which is just other versions of counters.

221
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,296
Speaker 0: Yeah, like there wasn't a counter.

222
00:16:21,357 --> 00:16:21,879
Speaker 0: It's like yeah.

223
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:24,470
Speaker 0: action quake had the die and wait thing.

224
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:25,476
Speaker 1: It also had the.

225
00:16:25,496 --> 00:16:34,670
Speaker 0: it's like you one hit kills you Yes, but it was action quake was still pretty much every man for themselves deathmatch II kind of situation.

226
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,180
Speaker 1: No, there were two modes.

227
00:16:36,201 --> 00:16:46,890
Speaker 0: The primary mode was five on five Yeah, but counter-strike had the DE and the CES and the you know, as well the oh my god AS or yes Yeah, and FY.

228
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:48,783
Speaker 0: That was there.

229
00:16:50,572 --> 00:16:52,919
Speaker 1: Really, I mean I assumed FY stood for.

230
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:57,353
Speaker 1: fuck you Man we can.

231
00:16:57,373 --> 00:16:57,915
Speaker 1: we even didn't.

232
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:01,809
Speaker 1: even we got into counter-strike on the tail end of AS missions continuing to exist.

233
00:17:02,852 --> 00:17:04,944
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much all rig with some good times.

234
00:17:05,428 --> 00:17:13,300
Speaker 1: So yeah Don't like be wary of Valorant even though the game actually looks like it might be good.

235
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,990
Speaker 1: I don't think you want to install it just yet.

236
00:17:16,451 --> 00:17:20,969
Speaker 1: Let's wait and see how many people's computers get grossly violated and or catch on fire.

237
00:17:26,176 --> 00:17:28,944
Speaker 1: but anyway things Of the day.

238
00:17:28,984 --> 00:17:29,529
Speaker 1: What do you got?

239
00:17:30,911 --> 00:17:32,498
Speaker 0: So way back in 1971 there was.

240
00:17:32,579 --> 00:17:33,784
Speaker 0: there was not a.

241
00:17:33,824 --> 00:17:34,447
Speaker 1: there was never in.

242
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:38,553
Speaker 0: Okay, whatever.

243
00:17:39,034 --> 00:17:42,022
Speaker 0: there was a TV commercial for McDonald's.

244
00:17:42,042 --> 00:17:45,170
Speaker 0: that was quite a production we should say.

245
00:17:46,812 --> 00:17:48,679
Speaker 0: And not having been alive at the time.

246
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,310
Speaker 0: I did not see this commercial when it was on television.

247
00:17:51,491 --> 00:17:53,950
Speaker 1: I've never seen this before until you sent me the link, right?

248
00:17:54,070 --> 00:18:00,052
Speaker 0: I did not have a nostalgic memory for it as I do for many classic commercials that did air when I was still watching Television.

249
00:18:00,072 --> 00:18:03,186
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think my earliest like commercial memory is where's the beef?

250
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:16,905
Speaker 0: Yeah And this come is fabulous high production value for 1971 television commercial Apparently contains famous actors Anson Williams and John Amos who I don't know who they are.

251
00:18:16,925 --> 00:18:18,510
Speaker 0: I had to google who they were.

252
00:18:18,871 --> 00:18:20,478
Speaker 1: Oh, the first recommended video is Johnny.

253
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:25,176
Speaker 1: John Amos discusses the McDonald's grab a bucket And mob commercial.

254
00:18:25,758 --> 00:18:28,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, but what's interesting is not only is it a singing?

255
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:33,150
Speaker 0: Dancing musical McDonald's commercial which is you know, pretty fabulous.

256
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:37,583
Speaker 0: It is also that it's not about the food.

257
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:52,389
Speaker 0: almost every McDonald's commercial or any food commercial you see these days right is always like You know doctored food photos and you know Get a McRib or a Big Mac or whatever, you know dollar menus and stuff like that, right?

258
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:59,439
Speaker 0: This is all about look how fucking clean McDonald's is well, or at least the McDonald's in the video is.

259
00:18:59,520 --> 00:18:59,801
Speaker 0: I can

260
00:19:00,022 --> 00:19:19,744
Speaker 1: give a little bit of context for that because the modern concept of fast food was evolving in that era and if you look at the history of Restaurants in the United States like and we've talked about this in cake nights before but like in eras before the 70s There really weren't restaurants that like people would go to the way we go to today.

261
00:19:19,824 --> 00:19:23,188
Speaker 1: restaurants acted very differently in America a long time ago.

262
00:19:23,531 --> 00:19:24,654
Speaker 1: prohibition kind of changed that.

263
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:40,310
Speaker 1: the evolution of fast food is like you could spend your life just studying the rise of fast food and The restaurant ecosystem that Existed in America in like the 50s and 60s and how broken and filthy and like messed up that ecosystem was.

264
00:19:41,432 --> 00:19:44,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, it's funny if you watch like lots of old movies, right?

265
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:49,910
Speaker 0: The restaurants that people go to are almost always in hotels, right?

266
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:50,975
Speaker 0: They're hotel restaurants.

267
00:19:51,035 --> 00:19:52,844
Speaker 0: this you don't see that.

268
00:19:52,884 --> 00:20:01,729
Speaker 1: many stand-alone Old movies see three times the restaurants fancy fancy restaurant that may or may not be in a hotel diner or it's a bar.

269
00:20:02,974 --> 00:20:06,329
Speaker 1: The only exception is it's like depending on the kind of piece it is.

270
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:10,925
Speaker 1: There might be like a local like family style place, but that's it.

271
00:20:11,106 --> 00:20:12,049
Speaker 1: four kinds of restaurants.

272
00:20:13,432 --> 00:20:18,834
Speaker 1: pretty much so in the vein of old Commercials my thing of the day.

273
00:20:18,854 --> 00:20:20,138
Speaker 1: I found this video.

274
00:20:20,198 --> 00:20:22,666
Speaker 1: It's a commercial for a roller coaster.

275
00:20:22,866 --> 00:20:25,035
Speaker 1: It's from 1989.

276
00:20:25,035 --> 00:20:25,826
Speaker 0: We were alive then.

277
00:20:25,846 --> 00:20:36,041
Speaker 1: yeah It's what I have nostalgia for because it's a commercial for the Magnum XL 200 roller coaster That debuted in 1989 at Cedar Point.

278
00:20:36,382 --> 00:20:39,935
Speaker 1: when I was a kid when this roller coaster was built It was probably.

279
00:20:40,015 --> 00:20:41,320
Speaker 0: how did you see that commercial?

280
00:20:41,561 --> 00:20:43,770
Speaker 0: I guess I guess you lived much closer to Cedar Point.

281
00:20:43,991 --> 00:20:52,939
Speaker 1: So you realize when I was a kid, but that's kind of why I made this my thing of the day The entire like multi-state area around Cedar Point.

282
00:20:52,979 --> 00:21:14,757
Speaker 1: if you lived anywhere in like, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Illinois Every year Before summer people would kind of wait for the Cedar Point commercial because every year Cedar Point would make a new commercial Like a high production value commercial and that commercial would reveal what the new roller coaster was because every year They made a new roller coaster.

283
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,253
Speaker 0: I guess there wasn't an internet to just find out Exactly.

284
00:21:18,453 --> 00:21:28,488
Speaker 1: So like yeah, I remember like there'd be local news stories saying rumors are that after the Simpsons tomorrow We will get to see the first commercial of Cedar Point's new ride.

285
00:21:28,973 --> 00:21:29,888
Speaker 1: We don't know what it is.

286
00:21:30,191 --> 00:21:31,576
Speaker 1: Stay tuned to find out like.

287
00:21:31,677 --> 00:21:34,930
Speaker 0: and none of those news reporters went to Cedar Point with like a camera.

288
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:38,341
Speaker 1: No, Cedar Point had like fucking security lockdowns.

289
00:21:38,401 --> 00:21:40,106
Speaker 1: They treated a pretty big.

290
00:21:40,146 --> 00:21:46,996
Speaker 0: you can see it from far away I'm sure yeah, but they would hard to hide a roller coaster it is true But they would put walls up.

291
00:21:47,196 --> 00:21:51,789
Speaker 1: Well as far as long as they could during like the early construction they'd cover stuff in shrouds.

292
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:54,550
Speaker 1: They wouldn't tell anything about the name of the roller coaster.

293
00:21:55,272 --> 00:22:00,005
Speaker 1: And also there wasn't really an internet like news agencies like really just didn't spoil it.

294
00:22:00,346 --> 00:22:00,727
Speaker 1: They'd wait.

295
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:01,769
Speaker 1: we'd wait for the announcement.

296
00:22:02,412 --> 00:22:03,538
Speaker 0: It was a. we had those two.

297
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:08,799
Speaker 0: what there was, you know, our commercials were for Six Flags Yeah, a Riverside or other places like that.

298
00:22:08,979 --> 00:22:13,839
Speaker 0: and which rep which became Six Flags New England eventually when I bought it out And those commercials.

299
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:15,649
Speaker 0: they didn't have a new roller coaster every year.

300
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:23,969
Speaker 0: Well Cedar Point was crazy and weird like and the commercials that they did show for the specific rides Would be proportional like to the cost of the ride.

301
00:22:24,471 --> 00:22:36,529
Speaker 0: So like when the Great American Scream Machine was made that you saw commercials for that thing for like several years Advertising Anymore as far as I'm aware like around March.

302
00:22:37,052 --> 00:22:42,010
Speaker 1: It would just be like everyone in school like as a kid would be buzzing like Cedar Point commercials coming soon.

303
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:42,953
Speaker 1: What are they building?

304
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:43,695
Speaker 1: What's going on?

305
00:22:43,736 --> 00:22:48,050
Speaker 1: Cuz every year they'd have a giant new ride and I remember was notable.

306
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:55,723
Speaker 1: there was one year was neither 94 or 95 where they didn't actually have a new ride and It was kind of like this weird local existential crisis.

307
00:22:56,004 --> 00:22:59,044
Speaker 1: People were like a cedar point doing okay Why did they make another roller coaster?

308
00:22:59,064 --> 00:22:59,609
Speaker 1: What's going on?

309
00:23:00,971 --> 00:23:12,809
Speaker 1: But I rode this roller coaster when it came out because when it was riding any roller coasters now, nope But it was the tallest and fastest roller coaster in the world by a wide margin.

310
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:18,189
Speaker 1: like This roller coaster when it came out was a big deal and made international news.

311
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:24,790
Speaker 1: It took a long time for roller coasters to exceed what the Magnum was capable of.

312
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,555
Speaker 1: This was the first mega coaster, but it wasn't the first giga coaster.

313
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:36,316
Speaker 1: in the meta moment Not doing much trying to make more content like keep watching our youtubes follow our stuff.

Speaker 1: Things are hopping more and more in there as I'm trying to remind people to actually go to it actually giving them the link When they ask me starting to try to hang out in there more.

317
00:23:47,581 --> 00:23:48,484
Speaker 1: Forum still rocking.

318
00:23:48,966 --> 00:23:50,190
Speaker 1: We're making content.

319
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,555
Speaker 1: I got my teleprompter set up.

320
00:23:51,595 --> 00:23:53,080
Speaker 1: I'm gonna do something this weekend.

321
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:55,429
Speaker 0: I don't know if that are you really good to do something?

322
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,879
Speaker 1: I'm gonna do something, but it'll be relatively acid.

323
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:04,599
Speaker 1: Well, mostly I'm gonna record a bunch of stuff just to make to set up my pipeline to very quickly be able to.

324
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:15,301
Speaker 1: I'm trying to set up an area in the living room where we're storing stuff because it's not like we're gonna have anyone over anytime soon and Make it really easy to just sit down record a video like me to me talking video Like.

325
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:17,231
Speaker 1: I want to be able to do that with zero efforts.

326
00:24:17,271 --> 00:24:18,498
Speaker 1: That's what I'm setting up this weekend.

327
00:24:19,553 --> 00:24:21,419
Speaker 1: Mmm-hmm Because you know think about it.

328
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:34,380
Speaker 1: Imagine how different the things we produce would be if there was a building we could both just go to Like after work or anytime we wanted and there was just a studio and we could both just sit down Hit a button and just start doing something.

329
00:24:35,021 --> 00:24:35,946
Speaker 0: There are places like that.

330
00:24:36,006 --> 00:24:36,710
Speaker 0: You just pay money for.

331
00:24:36,751 --> 00:24:38,199
Speaker 1: yeah, but I'm not paying money for that.

332
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:41,536
Speaker 1: I got time for that and money for you had to be able to go places exactly.

333
00:24:41,556 --> 00:24:44,205
Speaker 1: So Yeah, I'm not.

334
00:24:44,225 --> 00:24:46,440
Speaker 1: I don't need to have like anyone over to play board games.

335
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,371
Speaker 1: So the board game like kitchen table area is gonna be the.

336
00:24:49,893 --> 00:24:57,920
Speaker 1: I'm gonna be able to talk with the teleprompter area And then maybe I'll just if anything if I upload anything, I'll just upload like my own random teleprompter testing.

337
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,919
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna actually make like a video video yet.

338
00:25:01,164 --> 00:25:01,573
Speaker 1: Maybe I will.

339
00:25:01,593 --> 00:25:08,328
Speaker 1: we'll see Beyond all right playgrounds playgrounds Occupied your idea.

340
00:25:08,348 --> 00:25:10,020
Speaker 1: I mean, did you have a better idea?

341
00:25:10,901 --> 00:25:11,536
Speaker 1: No, there we go.

342
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:30,460
Speaker 1: But the playground like the playground had this almost mythological and very important like place in my psyche when I was a kid because I couldn't get to playgrounds unless my parents took me to them and They always seemed far away and big and it was like a special deal to go to the playground.

343
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:36,936
Speaker 1: I always wanted to go to them Partly because they had to think kind of like the arcade even though I had video games at home.

344
00:25:37,277 --> 00:25:39,163
Speaker 1: the arcade had games I couldn't have at home.

345
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:40,527
Speaker 1: I had toys at home.

346
00:25:40,848 --> 00:25:42,112
Speaker 1: the playground had toys.

347
00:25:42,634 --> 00:25:44,720
Speaker 1: I couldn't have at home, right?

348
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,120
Speaker 0: It's like you have a swing at home and then it's like you go to the playground and there's a fuck it.

349
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,033
Speaker 1: So yeah, the swing at the playground was like the swing.

350
00:25:52,073 --> 00:25:53,600
Speaker 1: I could really hurt myself on his foot.

351
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,508
Speaker 1: I got a slide.

352
00:25:54,649 --> 00:25:59,993
Speaker 0: you got a slide at home But at the playground they had like a giant slide or a spiral slide.

353
00:26:00,093 --> 00:26:02,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know some mega slide.

354
00:26:03,341 --> 00:26:10,100
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, there's no way unless you were mega rich that you could have something that big and or dangerous at home.

355
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:11,756
Speaker 0: Yeah equal to what the playground had.

356
00:26:13,362 --> 00:26:15,595
Speaker 0: But nowadays they don't make playgrounds like that anymore.

357
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:16,300
Speaker 0: I'm an old man.

358
00:26:17,168 --> 00:26:19,987
Speaker 1: Some of the things that are gone Definitely should be gone.

359
00:26:20,027 --> 00:26:21,273
Speaker 1: Those things were just death traps.

360
00:26:21,655 --> 00:26:22,740
Speaker 1: some of the things that are gone.

361
00:26:23,226 --> 00:26:26,886
Speaker 1: I see why they're gone But I want to see a modern Reimplementation of those things.

362
00:26:27,227 --> 00:26:30,460
Speaker 1: like it's a mixed bag on what has come and gone in playgrounds over the years.

363
00:26:31,042 --> 00:26:37,888
Speaker 1: Like I do appreciate the fact that there exists surfaces that will prevent Serious injuries when a child falls from a height.

364
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:38,731
Speaker 1: that did not.

365
00:26:38,992 --> 00:26:47,375
Speaker 1: that rubbery stuff did not exist when we were kids No, so I usually either fell on sand or more often asphalt and I kind of hurt myself off in it.

366
00:26:47,395 --> 00:26:55,160
Speaker 0: playgrounds or wood chips Or gravel the wood chips that always vaguely smelled like pee or just dirt and grass or sand.

367
00:26:56,622 --> 00:27:04,640
Speaker 1: And we got to separate the school playground from the municipal playground though as a kid We often went to the school playground on weekends because there's no one there.

368
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,339
Speaker 1: It wasn't locked like the cops wouldn't stop us or anything.

369
00:27:08,364 --> 00:27:09,820
Speaker 0: Well, there were certain features, right?

370
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:15,160
Speaker 0: So like I remember when I went to New York City playgrounds, they would often have like some sort of water feature.

371
00:27:15,222 --> 00:27:24,711
Speaker 1: It's oh, yeah Yeah Like that was not a thing in like Detroit or the Sun like I know like that is a very New York thing to have That water feature in the playground, right?

372
00:27:24,752 --> 00:27:26,882
Speaker 0: But the thing is even nowadays It's like you'd.

373
00:27:26,923 --> 00:27:31,280
Speaker 0: the water features that the playgrounds have are sort of like little crapple sprinklers or something like that.

374
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,446
Speaker 0: Did you see the new?

375
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:39,948
Speaker 1: because they rebuilt all those playgrounds by the projects north of us like between us My apartment in your apartment along the water.

376
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:42,279
Speaker 1: There are some pretty big water features in there.

377
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:52,632
Speaker 0: now No, there are ones I remember like they had like mega like fountain type things or like almost wading pool type stuff Going on.

378
00:27:52,774 --> 00:27:56,130
Speaker 1: Yeah Little bit of that going on in the new part of the playground.

379
00:27:56,150 --> 00:28:03,320
Speaker 0: if you find some old playgrounds that haven't been remodeled Which are becoming fewer and fewer because City Council people love to yeah ribbons on playground.

380
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:09,037
Speaker 1: Someone told me a while ago that Highland Park like the last great wooden playground that I knew about was finally demolished.

381
00:28:09,678 --> 00:28:18,900
Speaker 0: Yeah but like those If you can find one you can still see some like features that are there but disabled, right?

382
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,760
Speaker 0: There's no water flowing and no one turns it on.

383
00:28:20,841 --> 00:28:31,514
Speaker 1: Yeah, even as a kid They were always like every play get our rent to it had like the features that were still in use But there were like the ruins of the old features Like I remember when I was really really young.

384
00:28:31,555 --> 00:28:34,759
Speaker 1: there was one playground We'd always go to in Detroit and it had like stuff.

385
00:28:35,201 --> 00:28:45,966
Speaker 1: But there were these metal posts with like in cement blocks that clearly were there to hold up like old Seesaws that were not there anymore and as a kid I was vaguely obsessed with like.

386
00:28:46,468 --> 00:28:48,819
Speaker 1: what was there that I never got to play with?

387
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:54,159
Speaker 0: I Was always like Even at like my elementary school.

388
00:28:55,002 --> 00:29:03,548
Speaker 0: right, it's like we go to the playground and There was pretty early on when I got there like kindergarten first grade They built like a new wooden thing.

389
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:06,960
Speaker 0: right that was you know, the wooden style castle kind of sit.

390
00:29:07,222 --> 00:29:09,240
Speaker 1: Oh, that's the best the best possible furniture.

391
00:29:10,402 --> 00:29:11,867
Speaker 0: It was one of the earlier ones though.

392
00:29:11,928 --> 00:29:13,132
Speaker 0: So it wasn't that castle II.

393
00:29:13,172 --> 00:29:15,140
Speaker 0: Yeah opposed to some later ones, right?

394
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:20,672
Speaker 0: It was the early model castle But they put it next to the old playgrounds.

395
00:29:20,772 --> 00:29:27,459
Speaker 0: the old school playground With like just fucking swings and jungle gym seesaw, right?

396
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:43,618
Speaker 0: Was still there and then there was the new one and then there was a third one That was just like these exercise bits like pull-up bar Right like that sort of thing and not actually play like it wasn't fun.

397
00:29:43,638 --> 00:29:50,220
Speaker 0: Yeah It was like all these exercise things and next to each one was like a board that told you how to exercise on.

398
00:29:50,481 --> 00:29:52,210
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, those are all around New York.

399
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:53,718
Speaker 1: Like those are still like a really common thing.

400
00:29:54,402 --> 00:29:56,434
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah boy, like you're an adult who wants to exercise.

401
00:29:56,474 --> 00:29:56,998
Speaker 0: That's great.

402
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:01,636
Speaker 0: But as a kid When you're a kid is like god damn it, this isn't fun.

403
00:30:01,656 --> 00:30:02,120
Speaker 0: I don't want this.

404
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:05,151
Speaker 1: It's like discovering that what you thought was a chocolate chip was a raisin.

405
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:06,617
Speaker 1: You're just like ah, okay.

406
00:30:06,757 --> 00:30:16,220
Speaker 1: I love raisins though Yeah, but if you had the choice between a cookie with a raisin in it a cookie with a chocolate chip in it But not a raisin hater.

407
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:23,400
Speaker 1: So my favorite feature forever in playgrounds was always the giant wooden playscape like the big wooden castle thing.

408
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:24,708
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know those.

409
00:30:24,809 --> 00:30:25,756
Speaker 0: it's weird because it's like.

410
00:30:25,796 --> 00:30:32,369
Speaker 0: it feels Like, you know because of how old I am it feels like that those were newer But actually, you know those.

411
00:30:32,389 --> 00:30:34,399
Speaker 1: they were on the way out even when we were young.

412
00:30:35,142 --> 00:30:42,100
Speaker 0: They started to come into existence when I was in elementary school and they started to fade Right when I wasn't like a school college.

413
00:30:42,502 --> 00:30:48,105
Speaker 1: There was I think it was three mile park in Michigan Detroit and I remember as a kid.

414
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:51,900
Speaker 1: there was a big construction project and they built this three story.

415
00:30:52,281 --> 00:30:54,128
Speaker 1: Well three kids story not three real stories like.

416
00:30:54,168 --> 00:30:55,312
Speaker 1: it had three levels.

417
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,340
Speaker 1: That's how like giant it was.

418
00:30:57,842 --> 00:31:09,132
Speaker 1: it was basically like it was a structure so big that you could get lost in it and I remember being like utterly dumbstruck the first time I saw it as a kid and my brother and I endeavored to.

419
00:31:12,282 --> 00:31:14,038
Speaker 1: We were eventually found and brought home.

420
00:31:15,222 --> 00:31:19,080
Speaker 1: But I love those things to the point that as an adult I would still play in them.

421
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,501
Speaker 1: I remember vampire tag Like.

422
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,126
Speaker 1: I miss those days.

423
00:31:22,307 --> 00:31:32,599
Speaker 1: if there if there were a wooden playground like that in New York City today I would 100% get people together and play vampire tag in it like without any hesitation.

424
00:31:34,521 --> 00:31:45,240
Speaker 0: The other thing is that like I think we've talked about this in the episode long ago, but like it's sesame place They had you know many things that were you know playground adjacent, right?

425
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:53,931
Speaker 0: So there was like this cargo net thing that existed that I think was torn down at some point because obviously there's no way that That's safe enough for anyone in the year 20.

426
00:31:53,931 --> 00:31:55,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, I love those things.

427
00:31:55,521 --> 00:31:59,162
Speaker 1: I had one at Cedar Point that we would always be all about Right.

428
00:31:59,222 --> 00:32:03,013
Speaker 0: It was almost like, you know McDonald's play place on crack.

429
00:32:03,073 --> 00:32:04,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, right just like extreme, right?

430
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:12,680
Speaker 0: It was like several stories tall tons of nets all over the place tubes You know, it was like, you know, I don't remember if they let adults in there.

431
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,069
Speaker 0: I think they did but it's like how did you get in there?

432
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:18,180
Speaker 0: There's such narrow tube ways and stuff.

433
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:32,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, Cedar Point had a place called I think it was King Arthur's something like Camelot something but it was on the roof of this other ball pit building and it was basically just a giant one of those with cargo nets everywhere and basically zero supervision.

434
00:32:32,821 --> 00:32:37,998
Speaker 0: Yeah type sesame place cargo net into into Google image search and you'll see what I'm talking about.

435
00:32:38,058 --> 00:32:40,749
Speaker 0: Yeah How crazy this thing was.

436
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:41,552
Speaker 1: so get this.

437
00:32:41,632 --> 00:33:04,014
Speaker 1: I was googling for pictures of the old wooden place That's and I found a whole bunch of pictures that look Identical to the one we played vampire tag out at RIT and I learned something in All of New York like much of New York State other than New York City Almost every wooden structure and playgrounds was made by one company Leathers and associates in Ithaca.

438
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:12,680
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean that makes sense because when you went to different towns to see their different playgrounds They all looked pretty much the same and had the same pieces arranged in different ways.

439
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:21,420
Speaker 1: But Leathers was the company that made the one that was good for vampire tag Specifically and I thought I just looked at all these pictures of their play sets.

440
00:33:21,702 --> 00:33:23,820
Speaker 1: They all look like Highland Park and they all look amazing.

441
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,606
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's yeah.

442
00:33:25,847 --> 00:33:30,047
Speaker 1: Yeah, so other than the giant structures Like what was your favorite thing in the playground?

443
00:33:30,087 --> 00:33:33,860
Speaker 1: Like what was well, like what would you say is the top tier playground thing?

444
00:33:34,942 --> 00:33:46,723
Speaker 0: Well, I mean it all depends right because it you know If you're if you like swing is a good swing, right a good swing But it's like if it's a shitty swing I don't care.

445
00:33:46,783 --> 00:33:47,165
Speaker 0: so right.

446
00:33:47,246 --> 00:33:49,940
Speaker 0: or it's like you have a good slide or a shitty slide, right?

447
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:55,053
Speaker 0: So it's like I don't prefer swing or a slide But I just if it's good then it's good.

448
00:33:55,093 --> 00:33:55,677
Speaker 0: if it's not good.

449
00:33:55,717 --> 00:33:56,884
Speaker 0: It's not good I think it might.

450
00:33:56,924 --> 00:34:03,539
Speaker 1: my favorite feature like ever was large tire swing like the ones that were big.

451
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:21,080
Speaker 1: Mmm, you know, we have like a tire hanging from the roof because they felt more dangerous than they were and they required a moderate Amount of skill to not hurt yourself, but you wouldn't ever really hurt yourself too badly Unless they were installed badly like I remember as a kid like I love these tire swings.

452
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:29,155
Speaker 1: We even had one but we had some friends and they had a tire swing they'd made and their tire Swing was way too close to the trunk of the tree.

453
00:34:29,215 --> 00:34:29,899
Speaker 1: It was hanging from.

454
00:34:31,565 --> 00:34:32,799
Speaker 1: It was very easy to hit that trunk.

455
00:34:33,701 --> 00:34:36,940
Speaker 0: Well, but also if you put it further away down the branch the branch might snap.

456
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:40,154
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's got to be a real good tree to make that kind of tire swing.

457
00:34:40,516 --> 00:34:41,480
Speaker 1: but and the playground?

458
00:34:41,641 --> 00:34:47,719
Speaker 1: I did like the one that was like a tractor tire hanging sideways like hanging from three chains that would spin.

459
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:49,842
Speaker 1: mmm.

460
00:34:50,562 --> 00:34:55,322
Speaker 1: Yeah, my mate my main go-to as a kid was to climb inside the tire and get someone else to spin it as fast as Possible.

461
00:34:55,985 --> 00:34:56,146
Speaker 0: Yep.

462
00:34:56,266 --> 00:34:57,192
Speaker 0: That's a that's a good one.

463
00:34:57,252 --> 00:34:59,161
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yeah, that's the thing It's like.

464
00:34:59,322 --> 00:35:02,654
Speaker 0: so rather than say like which feature was the best right?

465
00:35:02,754 --> 00:35:04,480
Speaker 0: What makes a good one, right?

466
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:07,732
Speaker 0: What's a good slide from the bad slide, right?

467
00:35:07,752 --> 00:35:13,651
Speaker 0: So for me the best slide is a slide You'll never find these days, which is the solid steel.

468
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:16,057
Speaker 0: heats up in the Sun will burn you slide.

469
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,765
Speaker 0: Yeah, but just Ridiculously tall.

470
00:35:18,805 --> 00:35:18,946
Speaker 0: Yep.

471
00:35:19,026 --> 00:35:19,751
Speaker 0: That was my favorite.

472
00:35:20,153 --> 00:35:21,280
Speaker 1: That was my favorite thing by far.

473
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:25,933
Speaker 0: There was one that I don't know how ridiculously tall they actually were when I was a kid.

474
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:32,250
Speaker 0: right because I haven't seen any That's still standing back went to my memory.

475
00:35:32,511 --> 00:35:35,180
Speaker 0: Is that the tall slides were fucking tall?

476
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,953
Speaker 1: There was a slide so tall in a playground.

477
00:35:37,973 --> 00:35:39,140
Speaker 1: We used to go to in Detroit as a kid.

478
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,365
Speaker 1: I remember one point I looked up.

479
00:35:40,425 --> 00:35:44,262
Speaker 1: apparently it was like 30 feet tall and it was notably tall like Like.

480
00:35:44,422 --> 00:35:48,220
Speaker 1: people knew how tall it was because parents thought it was a problem and wanted to turn down.

481
00:35:48,682 --> 00:35:52,480
Speaker 1: But it was tall enough to where the ladder to climb up to it was cage.

482
00:35:52,881 --> 00:36:01,920
Speaker 1: So you couldn't get on the outside of it and fall off and there was a cage around the whole top Until you actually slid down the slide a little bit and then there was no more cage.

483
00:36:04,701 --> 00:36:10,918
Speaker 0: I'm looking I'm looking at like some websites about dangerous old playgrounds and you can see how tall the slides were.

484
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:15,336
Speaker 0: and it's like Oh, yeah, they were as tall as I remember pretty like what you think.

485
00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:15,938
Speaker 1: Oh, I was a kid.

486
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,445
Speaker 1: How tall could they have been?

487
00:36:17,485 --> 00:36:21,060
Speaker 1: you go to his adult and you're like, I'm actually kind of afraid of that as an adult.

488
00:36:21,962 --> 00:36:24,438
Speaker 0: Yeah as a kid, it wasn't a fry wasn't afraid of it at all.

489
00:36:24,478 --> 00:36:29,900
Speaker 1: Yeah Some of the changes they've made make sense because as a kid we had a play set like we had one of those things.

490
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:37,069
Speaker 1: It's like two tees with monkey bars in the middle and like a thing hanging off of the ends like in our backyard Like that was our mini play set.

491
00:36:37,471 --> 00:36:43,020
Speaker 1: But as a kid, I remember one day I just like climbed up on top of it and I stood up on the tee.

492
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:47,620
Speaker 1: So now I'm standing like almost 14 feet off the ground and I just jumps.

493
00:36:48,102 --> 00:36:53,180
Speaker 1: I had like just I into the ground with no thought about why I was doing this or whether or not it was dangerous.

494
00:36:54,403 --> 00:36:56,220
Speaker 0: Here's a picture of an old metal slide.

495
00:36:56,361 --> 00:37:00,576
Speaker 0: It says on on sunny days without shade the metal slide could get up past 160 degrees.

496
00:37:02,842 --> 00:37:06,214
Speaker 0: And here's a 35 foot tall spiral slide.

497
00:37:06,736 --> 00:37:07,880
Speaker 1: Oh, I like the spiral side.

498
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,229
Speaker 1: The problem was the spiral slide.

499
00:37:10,911 --> 00:37:15,559
Speaker 1: if you make it out of like modern safe materials Do you go too slow and they're actually not fun at all?

500
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:22,724
Speaker 1: If you make them out of metal while they're fine and fast they get so hot that they are dangerous Like I don't I do.

501
00:37:22,844 --> 00:37:26,938
Speaker 1: I do not miss the fact that I multiple times got blister burns from slides.

502
00:37:26,999 --> 00:37:29,140
Speaker 0: as a kid Like I was there and on them all the time.

503
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:34,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that was a problem, but there was this era where they started making slides out of plastic.

504
00:37:34,642 --> 00:37:36,599
Speaker 1: But the plastic you'd slide really fast on it.

505
00:37:36,941 --> 00:37:39,933
Speaker 1: but I remember the problem was that style slide.

506
00:37:40,254 --> 00:37:43,949
Speaker 1: you would generate a Massive static charge by sliding down.

507
00:37:44,451 --> 00:37:45,936
Speaker 1: and I remember one time as a kid.

508
00:37:45,996 --> 00:37:48,520
Speaker 1: I was in like third grade We had one of these at the school.

509
00:37:48,821 --> 00:37:52,899
Speaker 1: The school ended up getting rid of the slide because other kids kept hurting themselves on it the same way I did.

510
00:37:52,919 --> 00:38:03,986
Speaker 1: I Slid down it and when I got to the bottom I went to stand up and my right arm touched a metal bolt that was like recessed in the slide holding it together And I got a static shock.

511
00:38:04,067 --> 00:38:06,455
Speaker 1: so bad my entire arm went numb and I couldn't move it.

512
00:38:07,178 --> 00:38:07,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, it makes sense.

513
00:38:07,861 --> 00:38:09,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, the school actually got rid of that slide.

514
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:14,459
Speaker 1: It only existed for like a month and then they got rid of it, but it was perhaps so fast.

515
00:38:15,064 --> 00:38:24,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think if you want to really talk about danger I mean maybe in just Anecdotally the one you see people hurting themselves with the most on the internet is the merry-go-round where you can freely.

516
00:38:25,902 --> 00:38:32,396
Speaker 1: Those have to be banned solely because kids are too stupid to use them safely Like they don't understand how dangerous that actually is.

517
00:38:32,416 --> 00:38:37,280
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like you spin it around as kids want to spin it as fast as possible and jump on.

518
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:37,450
Speaker 0: Yeah

519
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:51,938
Speaker 1: And the problem is if you get a kid who's smart enough to come up with a way to spin it faster But not smart enough to Understand the improve the increased danger of spinning it faster like turning a bike sideways and putting the wheel up against it We did that a few times.

520
00:38:52,584 --> 00:38:54,158
Speaker 0: Well, I mean you can just deal with.

521
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:55,223
Speaker 0: you know The laws of physics.

522
00:38:55,303 --> 00:39:00,360
Speaker 0: right is like if you can somehow increase the you know, you start with a large radius spinning, right?

523
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:04,978
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you get the spin coming from the outside and then you get everyone to get towards the inside.

524
00:39:04,998 --> 00:39:06,724
Speaker 1: Yep We did the same thing.

525
00:39:07,426 --> 00:39:11,520
Speaker 0: or it's like even if you're just spinning alone on like say the tire swing that you just mentioned.

526
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:11,741
Speaker 0: Right.

527
00:39:11,781 --> 00:39:13,508
Speaker 0: It's like you stick your legs out you spin.

528
00:39:13,528 --> 00:39:14,734
Speaker 0: Yeah, you tuck them in.

529
00:39:14,754 --> 00:39:16,240
Speaker 1: We oh we had this kid Chris.

530
00:39:16,361 --> 00:39:21,454
Speaker 1: I remember we were hanging out in the playground one day when we were kids and we Got the tire swings.

531
00:39:21,494 --> 00:39:22,180
Speaker 1: We wound it up.

532
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:27,479
Speaker 1: We got a spinning so fast that it spun for a while and when it stopped spinning Chris was literally passed out in it.

533
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,246
Speaker 0: Yeah, makes sense.

534
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:30,594
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the blood just like went out.

535
00:39:30,614 --> 00:39:31,480
Speaker 1: He's just like passed out.

536
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:36,827
Speaker 1: He was fine, but that that could have been a problem Theoretically could have been a lot of problems.

537
00:39:36,847 --> 00:39:42,893
Speaker 0: and it's like, you know, I think oh, you know, we my whole life I was on these dangerous, you know survivor bias like we just got lucky.

538
00:39:43,575 --> 00:39:44,940
Speaker 0: Well, it's not even survivor bias.

539
00:39:45,061 --> 00:39:47,763
Speaker 0: It's like if I think back it's like yeah We survived.

540
00:39:47,884 --> 00:39:52,600
Speaker 0: but it's like there are basically injuries and band-aid situations like on a daily basis.

541
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:59,860
Speaker 1: Yeah Like I remember like I think back to when I was in elementary school Like how many kids had broken arms like in any random class?

542
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,118
Speaker 1: I was in compared to how many kids have broken arms in any random elementary school class.

543
00:40:04,158 --> 00:40:11,552
Speaker 0: today It's a safer time like yeah, it's like when I was in school there was as someone had a cast on at like all times.

544
00:40:11,592 --> 00:40:16,677
Speaker 0: there was always some kid in the class of the cast that we could draw on and Seeing kids on the street.

545
00:40:16,717 --> 00:40:22,440
Speaker 0: today I don't see a lot of cast like I remember in Because those kids are not out on the street because they can't they're having injury.

546
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:33,120
Speaker 1: But there were like five or six five or six kids broke their arm in My class in fifth grade during that one school year and all but one of those breakages were on the playground during school.

547
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:45,234
Speaker 1: But I think my favorite thing to do in the playground like my go-to was always the swings and Generally, I just tried to swing as high as possible and I was always chasing the.

548
00:40:45,255 --> 00:40:48,411
Speaker 1: I want to go over the bar Like I was one of those kids who tried.

549
00:40:48,431 --> 00:40:49,679
Speaker 0: you wanted to go over the bar.

550
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:51,989
Speaker 0: Okay I just I wanted to jump off the swing.

551
00:40:52,009 --> 00:40:53,596
Speaker 1: So I did jump off the swing all the time.

552
00:40:53,636 --> 00:40:55,486
Speaker 1: We'd go for distance We'd have distance competition.

553
00:40:55,506 --> 00:40:56,451
Speaker 0: Oh, yes, that's actually.

554
00:40:56,471 --> 00:40:57,517
Speaker 0: that's absolutely what we do.

555
00:40:57,617 --> 00:40:59,092
Speaker 0: even at home We would go for distance.

556
00:40:59,214 --> 00:41:00,910
Speaker 0: at home We went for distance.

557
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:05,820
Speaker 0: so much so like, you know The home playground the home swing set was concreted into the ground.

558
00:41:06,021 --> 00:41:14,540
Speaker 0: Yep, but we would swing so hard that like some of the concrete Like jump like to do the same thing happened.

559
00:41:15,042 --> 00:41:23,957
Speaker 1: We we started at the bottom like where the poles that held our first place set up Started to bend and deform and they were kind of broken and we had to replace it because we'd cause damage to it.

560
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:31,305
Speaker 1: No But yeah, and that we we have my brother and I and like we had at the playground We always had distance contests.

561
00:41:31,326 --> 00:41:37,940
Speaker 1: a lot of kids hurt themselves with those distance contests not in the landing Like I don't think anyone ever like broke a bone on the landing.

562
00:41:38,441 --> 00:41:47,428
Speaker 1: but multiple kids cut themselves badly because when they jumped they like didn't fully let go of the swing and would get caught in the Chain in some fashion.

563
00:41:47,448 --> 00:41:49,460
Speaker 0: I think that was the real danger, right?

564
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:55,763
Speaker 0: It's like if you successfully jumped it's like you would go forward and as long as there wasn't anything out there for you to hit Besides ground.

565
00:41:55,843 --> 00:41:57,629
Speaker 0: Yeah, you had a nice kid body.

566
00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:01,222
Speaker 1: You could land pretty sure a kid body landing on grass Like.

567
00:42:01,263 --> 00:42:04,159
Speaker 1: you were fine 99% of the time unless you got really lucky.

568
00:42:04,749 --> 00:42:15,620
Speaker 0: but yeah if you if on your release if either you Didn't release enough or if your clothing got caught on the chains or anything like that, then you could be in trouble.

569
00:42:15,801 --> 00:42:18,230
Speaker 1: I saw a lot of really bloody cuts because of that.

570
00:42:18,451 --> 00:42:20,719
Speaker 1: I cut myself pretty badly a few times with that.

571
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:25,388
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think there were actually a lot of swing sets Even the dangerous ones.

572
00:42:25,449 --> 00:42:27,340
Speaker 0: they put rubber coverings on the chains.

573
00:42:27,465 --> 00:42:28,724
Speaker 0: Yeah prevent a lot of those types.

574
00:42:28,784 --> 00:42:33,362
Speaker 1: my parents put those rubber coverings on the chains of our home swing set and they were always that Came with them.

575
00:42:33,783 --> 00:42:35,689
Speaker 0: Oh, it just came that way out of the box.

576
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:36,652
Speaker 1: Not bad.

577
00:42:37,073 --> 00:42:39,400
Speaker 1: The thing is that's a solvable problem.

578
00:42:39,681 --> 00:42:48,550
Speaker 1: I remember the first time I saw in an anime that Japanese style swing set where instead of a chain It's like bars with chain links on the ends of them.

579
00:42:49,212 --> 00:42:51,077
Speaker 0: That would be so much self issues.

580
00:42:51,097 --> 00:42:51,900
Speaker 0: You just ropes.

581
00:42:52,881 --> 00:42:53,986
Speaker 1: Yeah, the problem is the ropes.

582
00:42:54,327 --> 00:42:57,540
Speaker 1: so many kids would get rope burns on their hands because they wouldn't quite let go on the jump.

583
00:42:58,583 --> 00:43:02,711
Speaker 1: You know, it's better than a chain true But the ropes also would get damaged.

584
00:43:03,073 --> 00:43:09,576
Speaker 1: I remember one day We don't know if anyone got hurt but one day we went out to recess and I remember one of the swings was broken.

585
00:43:09,636 --> 00:43:12,227
Speaker 1: the rope had just like Broken at the top and snapped.

586
00:43:12,247 --> 00:43:15,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just find it kind of funny how you know.

587
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,605
Speaker 0: It's like playground.

588
00:43:16,625 --> 00:43:19,540
Speaker 0: the dangerous ones existed for a super long time, right?

589
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:21,689
Speaker 0: It's like our parents had playgrounds and they were kids right?

590
00:43:21,709 --> 00:43:24,480
Speaker 0: Yep, and I don't know if their parents did or not.

591
00:43:25,581 --> 00:43:25,962
Speaker 1: They did.

592
00:43:25,982 --> 00:43:29,451
Speaker 1: I've been looking up some histories sure and so.

593
00:43:29,632 --> 00:43:43,020
Speaker 0: but those adults right the generations before us Right, so boomers and older right as they got older Most of them didn't really have seemed to like recreate the playground in any way, right?

594
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:48,280
Speaker 0: It's like they would you know do other stuff, but it seems like our generation and younger.

595
00:43:48,942 --> 00:43:50,586
Speaker 0: It's like what are people doing?

596
00:43:50,867 --> 00:43:53,152
Speaker 0: They're rock climbing right?

597
00:43:53,253 --> 00:43:54,255
Speaker 0: It's like what the hell is that?

598
00:43:54,336 --> 00:43:56,040
Speaker 0: It's a fucking playground, right?

599
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,425
Speaker 0: It's like you fooling anybody.

600
00:43:57,445 --> 00:43:58,730
Speaker 0: They're going to the ropes course.

601
00:43:58,791 --> 00:43:59,755
Speaker 0: It's like what the fuck is that?

602
00:44:00,016 --> 00:44:01,060
Speaker 0: Hey fooling anybody?

603
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:04,032
Speaker 0: That's a fucking playground for adult size, right?

604
00:44:04,112 --> 00:44:05,980
Speaker 0: It's like who you fooling, right?

605
00:44:07,581 --> 00:44:13,660
Speaker 1: So it's interesting that I don't know our generation in general of experiences matter more to us than things.

606
00:44:14,203 --> 00:44:23,060
Speaker 0: I don't know if the people younger than us who had Who came after the wooden castle playground right into the land of the safe?

607
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:26,459
Speaker 0: But still potentially fun playground because they still see kids having fun on those.

608
00:44:26,627 --> 00:44:27,763
Speaker 0: Yeah They must be good.

609
00:44:27,843 --> 00:44:29,628
Speaker 1: the playground by Vernon Jackson near us.

610
00:44:29,869 --> 00:44:34,986
Speaker 1: like if it wasn't it literally illegal for me to enter that playground I would go in there and play.

611
00:44:35,367 --> 00:44:36,593
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that's if there is.

612
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:38,771
Speaker 0: the playgrounds weren't illegal for me to go in I would go in.

613
00:44:38,995 --> 00:44:39,138
Speaker 1: yep.

614
00:44:40,201 --> 00:44:44,716
Speaker 0: But yeah, the they're clearly having fun on those even though they appear much safer.

615
00:44:44,776 --> 00:44:49,819
Speaker 0: this so there wasn't like, you know This imagined danger fun trade-off that I think is just not real.

616
00:44:51,123 --> 00:45:02,226
Speaker 0: but I wonder if those kids on those will a Have that same Nostalgia and or even it whether it's a nostalgia or not, but have that desire for a playground when they're older Mm-hmm.

617
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:17,260
Speaker 0: And also I wonder how many kids outside of cities where there's a lot of playgrounds how like as the playground Interest decreased because of internet like our kids still playgrounding How many suburban kids still have playground in their swing set?

618
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:21,260
Speaker 1: I mean, I do think back to when we were at Disney several years ago me and Emily for someone's wedding.

619
00:45:21,742 --> 00:45:24,880
Speaker 1: And while we were there we were like we've ran into this family.

620
00:45:24,961 --> 00:45:41,718
Speaker 1: we're kind of near them for a while and their kid had a like op tablet out and was watching a YouTube stream of someone playing Minecraft and gave zero fucks about Disney and was pissed the entire time that they couldn't just watch the stream and that they had to walk around Disney while they watched the stream.

621
00:45:42,724 --> 00:45:46,362
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, I Just remember that as a moment pure Anecdote.

622
00:45:46,382 --> 00:45:51,560
Speaker 1: it like I don't know because the playgrounds at least in New York completely full all the time except now obviously.

623
00:45:52,352 --> 00:45:55,072
Speaker 1: Yeah Like the one in Vernon Jackie, you can't find a place.

624
00:45:55,394 --> 00:45:56,280
Speaker 1: So I saw something interesting.

625
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,076
Speaker 1: I'm skimming through the Wikipedia to see if there's like anything any notable things about playgrounds.

626
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:16,780
Speaker 1: and there's this whole idea in like the research around playgrounds that one of the primary values of a playground for children is that Adults and parents Feel like they control the playground and thus and it feels like a place that's relatively safe for the kids.

627
00:46:17,201 --> 00:46:23,116
Speaker 1: So they tend to get lax in their attention leaving the kids more unsupervised than the parents realize.

628
00:46:23,417 --> 00:46:24,600
Speaker 1: but how simultaneously?

629
00:46:25,302 --> 00:46:27,426
Speaker 1: That's actually the primary value.

630
00:46:27,486 --> 00:46:36,832
Speaker 1: playgrounds have two children because it gives them less supervised time to explore boundaries more without Significantly increased risk with only slightly increased risk.

631
00:46:37,073 --> 00:46:39,020
Speaker 1: and there's like real study around that.

632
00:46:40,081 --> 00:46:45,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, that seems accurate to me because when I was on the playground it definitely felt like, you know much like at the public pool.

633
00:46:46,061 --> 00:46:52,872
Speaker 0: It's like yeah your parents bring you there They sit on the side and then you're in this Separate land and you almost forget they exist until they come to get.

634
00:46:52,892 --> 00:46:55,060
Speaker 1: and then did you do the thing where you'd like seek out?

635
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:12,300
Speaker 1: Like you'd climb into the tiny area of the play set that really wasn't supposed to be a place to hang out But there'd be like ten kids hanging out in there for some reason Yep, or like there's the three trees like on the edge of the playground and like kids would just like cluster hiding inside of those Trees for some reason even though there's a giant field next to them.

636
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,781
Speaker 1: They're just ignoring that.

637
00:47:13,842 --> 00:47:23,600
Speaker 0: one of the wooden ones had a feature that was just a bunch of tires as almost like a ramp and I guess the Idea was that you would climb up the tires to get to the top and then go over the bar and now you're in the playground.

638
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:24,785
Speaker 1: There's hiding inside the tires.

639
00:47:25,187 --> 00:47:28,100
Speaker 0: people would just go underneath the tires and that's like a little fort area.

640
00:47:28,866 --> 00:47:30,700
Speaker 0: So there's like a blanket fort situation.

641
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:35,900
Speaker 1: There's specific evidence that those tiny spaces and forts are like for whatever reasons.

642
00:47:36,002 --> 00:47:43,320
Speaker 1: No one's 100% sure Why are crucial to that childhood development and like the way kids interact on playgrounds like you got a memory?

643
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,806
Speaker 0: That I don't know if it's real or not.

644
00:47:46,227 --> 00:47:47,692
Speaker 0: Maybe my mom could confirm it.

645
00:47:48,134 --> 00:47:55,380
Speaker 0: memory is that there was a tiny Children's clothing store somewhere in Connecticut that I would she would take me to to buy clothes in the mall.

646
00:47:56,381 --> 00:48:01,299
Speaker 0: No, I stand alone like strip mall clothing store, okay, there's only children's clothing.

647
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:01,600
Speaker 0: I don't know.

648
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:02,366
Speaker 0: I have this memory.

649
00:48:02,487 --> 00:48:04,260
Speaker 0: it could be false depending on what you say.

650
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,610
Speaker 1: I think I know the place you're talking about.

651
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:07,031
Speaker 1: I think it was.

652
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:07,774
Speaker 1: no you don't chain.

653
00:48:07,794 --> 00:48:09,421
Speaker 0: Oh I get.

654
00:48:09,482 --> 00:48:10,667
Speaker 0: I guess that could be possible.

655
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:11,651
Speaker 0: They didn't feel Cheney.

656
00:48:12,174 --> 00:48:29,587
Speaker 0: It felt indeed anyway But my memory is that in the back of the clothing store There was basically next to the door for the bathroom Was like a mouse hole but big enough for a child to go through but not big enough for an adult to go through and You would go in that hole.

657
00:48:29,607 --> 00:48:31,420
Speaker 0: and there was a room behind the store.

658
00:48:31,781 --> 00:48:38,200
Speaker 0: No, it was like a carpeted room that had like I don't was there a television showing children's programming?

659
00:48:38,361 --> 00:48:44,741
Speaker 0: Maybe but I definitely remember there being like, you know like a Fisher Price car and some toys and Some.

660
00:48:45,444 --> 00:48:51,355
Speaker 0: it was like a. it was like a hidey secret kind of place and it felt like adults couldn't get in there Although I'm sure they could.

661
00:48:51,396 --> 00:48:54,852
Speaker 1: yeah If so, there was something very similar in all the malls like this.

662
00:48:54,952 --> 00:48:56,940
Speaker 1: there were multiple of these and I remembered as a kid.

663
00:48:57,302 --> 00:49:11,827
Speaker 1: It was a children's clothing store that was in the mall and in the entrance There's like a normal entrance and there was this little mouse hole with carpet in it like just like so like next to it connecting the mall to the store next to the regular door and kids would always go crawling through the hole.

664
00:49:11,848 --> 00:49:16,155
Speaker 1: or Kids would like wedge themselves in that hole like upside down and just play in the hole.

665
00:49:16,175 --> 00:49:25,457
Speaker 1: and inside the store There's another little mouse hole that went into like this playroom that had like a tiny slide and a TV and like some kids toys And there were never adults in that tiny room.

666
00:49:27,481 --> 00:49:30,594
Speaker 0: Mmm, it's similar to my yeah, possibly false memory.

667
00:49:30,614 --> 00:49:32,100
Speaker 1: I'm trying to google a little bit.

668
00:49:32,221 --> 00:49:41,126
Speaker 1: I can't figure out what the fuck this place was to even begin to find a picture to figure out if this was actually a chain that we both went to or My memory was not a chain.

669
00:49:41,166 --> 00:49:44,517
Speaker 0: My memory was like a dark brown carpeted 70s 80s style room.

670
00:49:45,821 --> 00:49:48,734
Speaker 1: Yeah, but this might really but part of the difference might be.

671
00:49:48,754 --> 00:49:53,293
Speaker 1: I lived in an area That was very much more mall centric as opposed to strip malls.

672
00:49:53,353 --> 00:49:57,349
Speaker 0: I live directly next to a mall Yeah, but this place was not in that mall.

673
00:49:57,509 --> 00:50:05,549
Speaker 1: Yeah, the place I'm talking about was in the mall specifically Anyway, but it's like there's all these playground adjacent things.

674
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:06,873
Speaker 0: right McDonald's play place.

675
00:50:07,475 --> 00:50:09,200
Speaker 0: even the McDonald's play places nowadays.

676
00:50:09,341 --> 00:50:10,709
Speaker 0: They're like a bunch of tubes, right?

677
00:50:10,729 --> 00:50:12,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, like plastic tubes.

678
00:50:13,142 --> 00:50:16,533
Speaker 0: I remember ones like when I was super young and I still went to McDonald's.

679
00:50:16,614 --> 00:50:21,227
Speaker 0: there was one that was basically a giant Hamburger like it was on a stick.

680
00:50:21,489 --> 00:50:23,919
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was one of those inside of Chuck E. Cheese's.

681
00:50:24,763 --> 00:50:27,760
Speaker 0: You would go in the stick and climb up a ladder inside.

682
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:31,480
Speaker 1: I mean hit your head on it because it was really hard even as a tiny kid to navigate that thing.

683
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:33,900
Speaker 0: It would not be impossible for an adult to get in there.

684
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:34,703
Speaker 0: I don't know how they would.

685
00:50:34,723 --> 00:50:42,138
Speaker 0: then you're inside like this basic UFO on a stick similar to like You know, I guess Corona Park right like a world.

686
00:50:42,158 --> 00:50:47,073
Speaker 1: I Remember that exact that exact feature in the Chuck E. Cheese.

687
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:48,137
Speaker 1: Well, it wasn't a Chuck E. Cheese.

688
00:50:48,157 --> 00:50:48,900
Speaker 1: I'm saying Chuck E. Cheese.

689
00:50:49,181 --> 00:50:56,560
Speaker 1: It was actually a major magics, but I don't think anyone knows what that is Right, but I feel like there is a McDonald's with a play place.

690
00:50:57,241 --> 00:51:04,213
Speaker 0: Actually in a story and by the subway, but and they actually redid it recently They totally renovated that play place.

691
00:51:04,233 --> 00:51:09,218
Speaker 0: like these things still exist But I just don't feel they're that prevalent as they used to be.

692
00:51:09,238 --> 00:51:16,439
Speaker 1: yeah Well the way fast-food places make money and the place like the way they interact with society has changed a lot.

693
00:51:16,459 --> 00:51:18,172
Speaker 0: because well Oh here is a picture of it.

694
00:51:18,213 --> 00:51:24,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's it's a It's like a. yeah, it's like a little stick and it looks like a hamburger with bars around.

695
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:27,973
Speaker 0: Yeah, right and then there's a. there's a little hat.

696
00:51:27,993 --> 00:51:29,740
Speaker 0: So it looks like a policeman hamburger.
