1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,979
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, October 5th, 2023.

2
00:00:09,979 --> 00:00:10,240
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,355 --> 00:00:13,830
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,436
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

5
00:00:15,496 --> 00:00:18,630
Speaker 0: We are reviewing the Warwick Applefest.

6
00:00:21,611 --> 00:00:22,628
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,730
Speaker 0: So, uh... I don't have an opening bit about biking.

8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,360
Speaker 0: Like, nothing weird happened.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,167
Speaker 0: Nothing squirrelly.

10
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:32,590
Speaker 0: But I spent my lunch hanging out in Bryant Park.

11
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,789
Speaker 0: And, uh, do you know what's going on in Bryant Park right now?

12
00:00:37,535 --> 00:00:38,722
Speaker 1: Uh, it's springtime.

13
00:00:38,742 --> 00:00:40,029
Speaker 1: There should be a movie screen up.

14
00:00:40,612 --> 00:00:43,149
Speaker 0: So, uh, they have torn up all the grass.

15
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:46,350
Speaker 0: And are already putting the skating rink together.

16
00:00:48,278 --> 00:00:48,630
Speaker 1: Oh, right.

17
00:00:49,191 --> 00:00:50,829
Speaker 0: They are the skating rink...

18
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,486
Speaker 1: I was like, "Oh, it's

19
00:00:52,546 --> 00:00:52,890
Speaker 1: spring.".

20
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,302
Speaker 1: It's like, "No, it's not.

21
00:00:54,706 --> 00:00:54,807
Speaker 1: It's

22
00:00:54,827 --> 00:00:54,948
Speaker 1: fall.".

23
00:00:55,331 --> 00:00:56,502
Speaker 1: Like, "It's spring.

24
00:00:56,543 --> 00:00:57,289
Speaker 1: They should be putting...".

25
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:06,570
Speaker 0: So, they have already gotten about halfway through building the skating rink and the winter Christmas village in Bryant Park.

26
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:12,129
Speaker 0: So, as a result, there's, like, nowhere to sit because the whole park is fucked up with this construction and all this nonsense.

27
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:15,809
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, it was 78 degrees and sunny.

28
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:21,170
Speaker 0: So, everyone in Midtown was trying to hang out in Bryant Park like you would.

29
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:26,290
Speaker 0: And it was packed to the point that it was like a PAX Expo Hall pre-COVID.

30
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,950
Speaker 0: Like, people trying to get into the park and then, like, failing and nonsense and chaos.

31
00:01:31,672 --> 00:01:46,468
Speaker 0: But, I guess what stuck out to me is that I feel like places like New York City, whatever part of the bowels of New York City's government is responsible for planning, the day the Christmas village starts getting built...

32
00:01:47,097 --> 00:01:47,770
Speaker 1: The parks department?

33
00:01:47,872 --> 00:01:48,087
Speaker 1: Yes.

34
00:01:48,490 --> 00:02:00,727
Speaker 0: At no point has considered whether or not that day should move based on climate change and the fact that it's not going to be cold enough for that skating rink to work probably for a month or two.

35
00:02:01,692 --> 00:02:07,689
Speaker 1: It's going to be built... You would be actually shocked at the high temperatures that a skating rink can operate at.

36
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,570
Speaker 1: Obviously, it takes more energy for the cooling system, right?

37
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,530
Speaker 0: Well, but also, it's wet ice, which, like, yes, technically you can skate on it.

38
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:21,529
Speaker 0: But, and I guess that's fine if it's, you know, public skating in New York when really it's just a bunch of tourists waddling around.

39
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,070
Speaker 1: I think I had a thing of the day once about the company that does portable skating rinks.

40
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:29,630
Speaker 1: They set one up at, like, a ballroom at, like, you know, Georgia University, right?

41
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:35,874
Speaker 0: But, more importantly, they've taken up a huge percentage of the park with the Christmas village and the shopping nonsense.

42
00:02:35,914 --> 00:02:44,550
Speaker 0: now at a time when the weather is going to be nice and people want to hang out in the park on the grass for at least another month or two the way things are going.

43
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,640
Speaker 1: So, I gotta figure... The Christmas village opens... When does it open?

44
00:02:50,721 --> 00:02:51,760
Speaker 0: It's mostly built.

45
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,420
Speaker 0: Like, a bunch of the huts are fully functional and there's merchandise in them already.

46
00:02:55,862 --> 00:02:59,960
Speaker 1: I'm just looking at the park's department website to see, like, the day that it's supposed to start.

47
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:12,620
Speaker 1: Because it's like, yeah, it's like if they're gonna, you know, open it on a certain day, then it's like obviously you have to start building it far enough in advance that it's ready on that day.

48
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,940
Speaker 1: I just don't know what the day is.

49
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:21,999
Speaker 0: Surprisingly close to being done based on the work they're doing, meaning the park is basically useless to people now until Christmas.

50
00:03:24,363 --> 00:03:27,560
Speaker 1: I mean, usually that thing is still open in, like, early January, too, right?

51
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:27,896
Speaker 1: Yeah.

52
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,339
Speaker 0: If you want some really overpriced stuff.

53
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,180
Speaker 0: And some actually pretty good food.

54
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:41,119
Speaker 0: The food there is actually... Every year, the only complaint I have about the food is that there are very long lines to get food at it and the food tends to take a while, but...

55
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,625
Speaker 1: Here we go.

56
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:42,820
Speaker 1: Bryant Park Event Club.

57
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:49,920
Speaker 0: The food in there tends to be pretty good and I feel at least I can... If it's gonna be open early, I can go over there and get that melted cheese for lunch.

58
00:03:53,444 --> 00:03:58,080
Speaker 1: Anyway... The park event calendar does not say which day the thing starts.

59
00:03:59,201 --> 00:04:09,094
Speaker 0: Anyway, in the news, something historic, and usually when you say something historic happened in American politics, in the current era, that means something very bad happened.

60
00:04:09,114 --> 00:04:10,320
Speaker 0: and that is true once again.

61
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,959
Speaker 0: Something historic has happened.

62
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:25,340
Speaker 0: For the first time in the history of America's democracy, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, which is the lower chamber of our Congress, has been ousted, meaning they were kicked out.

63
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, this happens in other countries.

64
00:04:26,581 --> 00:04:29,700
Speaker 1: They oust their prime minister with the no-confidence votes, basically the same thing.

65
00:04:30,362 --> 00:04:37,140
Speaker 0: It's a very different kind of thing because of the structure of the elections there and the fact that a prime minister serves at the pleasure of a coalition.

66
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,753
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm just saying it's...

67
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:52,460
Speaker 0: They're very different too in that they happen commonly because there is a process around it where if the coalition falls, then the prime minister gets booted basically automatically through a no-confidence vote.

68
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,840
Speaker 1: I think the biggest difference is that when that happens, you usually have elections.

69
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:06,560
Speaker 0: Well, that's it because the process is you need an election to restructure the parliament and then, based on the results of the election, a new coalition has to form and that coalition appoints a new prime minister.

70
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,137
Speaker 1: It sure would be great if this triggered an election.

71
00:05:11,157 --> 00:05:11,760
Speaker 1: That would be nice.

72
00:05:12,463 --> 00:05:13,960
Speaker 1: That would fix things maybe a little bit.

73
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,482
Speaker 1: It doesn't.

74
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:22,739
Speaker 1: We have the problem where we have the no-confidence vote and then no election, so you're stuck with the same people and those people just figure it out.

75
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:23,361
Speaker 0: Yep.

76
00:05:23,582 --> 00:05:43,720
Speaker 0: It's even worse than that because in America, because there's basically... Due to the nature of what our speaker is responsible for, because the Speaker of the House in America is paradoxically one of the most powerful political positions on earth because our government is designed very stupidly in this regard.

77
00:05:43,860 --> 00:06:05,180
Speaker 0: So if you're not a U.S.ian, basically the House only ever votes on things that the Speaker personally, with zero oversight, decides come to the floor to a vote and no one can supersede them except in extremely narrow circumstances that are almost impossible to trigger.

78
00:06:06,182 --> 00:06:08,833
Speaker 1: It doesn't have to be that way, but that's the rules.

79
00:06:08,873 --> 00:06:10,459
Speaker 1: the House has decided for itself.

80
00:06:10,901 --> 00:06:16,060
Speaker 0: Well, the only way to change... Well, some of that is constitutional because there's some other things going on.

81
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,480
Speaker 0: The Speaker of the House is also in the line of succession for the President.

82
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,945
Speaker 1: But basically, it literally is.

83
00:06:19,985 --> 00:06:36,873
Speaker 1: There literally is a file cabinet that has all the bills that everyone's... Let's say even if everyone in the whole House, all those hundreds of people, they wrote a bill, they worked together in committees, and they edited it, and they... Even both parties are in love with this bill.

84
00:06:36,994 --> 00:06:38,200
Speaker 1: Everyone is going to vote yes.

85
00:06:38,883 --> 00:06:44,713
Speaker 1: It could just sit there, and the Speaker of the House could be like, "I don't feel like we're not going to have a vote for this,".

86
00:06:44,793 --> 00:06:47,626
Speaker 1: and it doesn't become a law, and it just sits there.

87
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,980
Speaker 1: And then if the Congress ends, right?

88
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:59,680
Speaker 1: It's like, this is the thing that really bothers me, not just about the federal House, but the federal Congress, but most of the state ones, maybe all of them.

89
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,680
Speaker 0: Oh, that they can just now finish their business and then go home on vacation?

90
00:07:03,601 --> 00:07:03,822
Speaker 1: Right.

91
00:07:03,902 --> 00:07:08,198
Speaker 1: It's like that there's these sessions that end, and there's clocks.

92
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,650
Speaker 1: It's like the New York State budget every year.

93
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,218
Speaker 1: It's like, "We've got to get the budget done by this

94
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:12,520
Speaker 1: date.".

95
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,046
Speaker 1: And it's like, "What the fuck are you talking about?

96
00:07:14,086 --> 00:07:16,937
Speaker 1: Shouldn't you be working every week of the

97
00:07:16,998 --> 00:07:17,218
Speaker 1: year?".

98
00:07:18,361 --> 00:07:25,220
Speaker 1: I'm not saying you shouldn't get no vacation ever, because you're still laboring, and it's difficult labor, indeed.

99
00:07:27,622 --> 00:07:30,694
Speaker 1: But my company doesn't shut down when I'm on vacation.

100
00:07:30,735 --> 00:07:32,100
Speaker 1: Let people take their vacations.

101
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:34,652
Speaker 1: They can proxy vote or whatever when they're away.

102
00:07:34,753 --> 00:07:40,492
Speaker 1: And then it's like, don't stop legislating ever, and don't have weird deadlines.

103
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:43,000
Speaker 1: Just always be legislating all the time.

104
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,500
Speaker 0: Okay, so I think I wanted to respond to almost every few words you said, but that last one's an important one.

105
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:56,560
Speaker 0: So in the House right now, this was all triggered by a budget vote based on one of those deadlines.

106
00:07:56,821 --> 00:08:05,320
Speaker 0: That deadline is fucking made up by Republicans to make sure we have this crisis on a regular basis.

107
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,049
Speaker 0: So it's a made up deadline.

108
00:08:07,352 --> 00:08:08,420
Speaker 0: They can just vote to get rid of it.

109
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,610
Speaker 1: They're all made up.

110
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,580
Speaker 1: All the deadlines are made up.

111
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,264
Speaker 0: This one is extra made up.

112
00:08:12,686 --> 00:08:14,671
Speaker 0: It is the most made up deadline.

113
00:08:15,534 --> 00:08:17,720
Speaker 0: And it's solely because of our Republican Party.

114
00:08:18,141 --> 00:08:18,844
Speaker 0: But it gets worse.

115
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:30,540
Speaker 0: The vast majority, like almost every member of the House, was more than happy to vote on a bill that just continued our current funding to get past the deadline.

116
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:35,039
Speaker 0: And it was eight motherfuckers who didn't want to vote for it in the Republican Party.

117
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:40,214
Speaker 0: These eight people are basically literal Nazis.

118
00:08:40,234 --> 00:08:42,480
Speaker 0: They are the worst people in our government.

119
00:08:44,126 --> 00:08:46,780
Speaker 0: And one of them literally looks like Butthead from Beavis and Butthead.

120
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,728
Speaker 0: He is the instigator of all of this.

121
00:08:50,095 --> 00:08:51,100
Speaker 0: There's so much going on here.

122
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,211
Speaker 0: So everyone wanted to pass this.

123
00:08:53,553 --> 00:08:54,740
Speaker 0: It's an obvious thing to pass.

124
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,660
Speaker 0: And passing it is only required for bullshit made up reasons.

125
00:08:58,242 --> 00:09:00,940
Speaker 0: And yet they couldn't pass it because the Speaker refused to put it to a vote.

126
00:09:01,422 --> 00:09:12,060
Speaker 0: because the Republicans only ever want to pass bills with only Republican support because they don't want to ever, they've said this out loud, make any compromise with the Democratic Party under any circumstances ever.

127
00:09:12,482 --> 00:09:16,420
Speaker 0: Either pass something with only Republican votes or never bring it to the floor.

128
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,660
Speaker 0: That is like the most sacrosanct rule of the Republican Party.

129
00:09:21,181 --> 00:09:31,040
Speaker 0: So the Speaker of the House, who is a dipshit, like don't get me wrong, I'm not praising him at any point, he is a fascist, he is a horrible, he is a very bad person, McCarthy.

130
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:47,618
Speaker 0: But after he tried to get the Republicans to pass a bill on their own and these eight dipshits said no, he actually did the reasonable thing and brought the generic bill to the floor to say, "Look, we're all going to vote on this and if Democrats vote for it, it'll

131
00:09:47,638 --> 00:09:47,900
Speaker 0: pass.".

132
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,462
Speaker 0: And guess what?

133
00:09:49,165 --> 00:09:53,240
Speaker 0: All the Democrats voted for it except like one and like a hundred Republicans voted for it.

134
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,840
Speaker 0: And it passed immediately and we avoided a government shutdown.

135
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,725
Speaker 0: The dipshit caucus then immediately removed the Speaker from power and now the U.S.

136
00:10:01,745 --> 00:10:05,800
Speaker 0: House has no Speaker and cannot do anything and is completely powerless.

137
00:10:06,622 --> 00:10:08,619
Speaker 1: Well good, if it can't do anything, it can't do anything bad.

138
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,494
Speaker 0: That's true, except that deadline, the bill that got passed.

139
00:10:13,514 --> 00:10:15,300
Speaker 0: the deadline just pushed the deadline off a month.

140
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,859
Speaker 0: So we're going to have this exact crisis soon and it's going to be bad.

141
00:10:19,544 --> 00:10:19,686
Speaker 0: Awesome.

142
00:10:19,849 --> 00:10:20,500
Speaker 1: It'll be hilarious.

143
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,220
Speaker 0: Even funnier, the dipshit, the butthead guy, who is the instigator of all of this, the House was working to kick him out of the House actually.

144
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,260
Speaker 0: Like the Republicans want to kick him out of the House for ethics violations.

145
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,340
Speaker 0: Guess what they can't do until there's a new Speaker?

146
00:10:35,112 --> 00:10:35,280
Speaker 1: Yeah.

147
00:10:36,443 --> 00:10:40,960
Speaker 0: And guess who can prevent them from voting on a new Speaker?

148
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:41,968
Speaker 1: Yeah.

149
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:49,960
Speaker 0: It's a game of chicken where there's literally no way out of it except a coup or a huge percentage of the Republicans allying with the Democrats.

150
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,087
Speaker 1: You don't need a huge percentage.

151
00:10:52,107 --> 00:10:53,617
Speaker 1: You need like four or five.

152
00:10:53,637 --> 00:10:54,100
Speaker 1: I haven't counted.

153
00:10:55,402 --> 00:10:56,426
Speaker 0: That's the fun part.

154
00:10:56,566 --> 00:11:00,040
Speaker 0: There's a tricky way this could go because the Democrats are playing this very smart.

155
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:13,120
Speaker 0: Their plan is that every time there's a House vote for the new Speaker, which is the only thing the House is allowed to do until they have a new Speaker, the Democrats are going to vote for Hakeem Jeffries, who is an awesome dude.

156
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,301
Speaker 0: Of course.

157
00:11:13,322 --> 00:11:15,479
Speaker 1: That's what they did the last time, which is the right thing to do.

158
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:15,960
Speaker 0: Yep.

159
00:11:16,502 --> 00:11:23,819
Speaker 0: And the Republicans either have to get 100% of their members to vote for somebody, and that's not going to happen.

160
00:11:24,424 --> 00:11:25,460
Speaker 1: Or Hakeem Jeffries wins.

161
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,779
Speaker 0: Or five of them have to vote for Hakeem Jeffries.

162
00:11:28,503 --> 00:11:35,298
Speaker 0: And Jeffries would probably be more than happy to make some concessions and work with the people who decided to do that.

163
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,080
Speaker 1: Jeffries would be probably the best Speaker of the House ever.

164
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:41,581
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

165
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:43,007
Speaker 0: Hakeem Jeffries is odd.

166
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:45,960
Speaker 0: Just go read about his deal.

167
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,820
Speaker 0: He is one of the best politicians in America right now, like Hakeem for President, for real.

168
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:51,503
Speaker 0: Yeah, sure.

169
00:11:51,524 --> 00:11:52,410
Speaker 1: That's great.

170
00:11:52,632 --> 00:11:53,740
Speaker 1: That's an easy vote.

171
00:11:54,583 --> 00:12:07,020
Speaker 0: So, despite all of this, this is a crisis, partly because this has literally never happened, and there are a lot of constitutional questions, and there's a lot of unclear steps on how this all is going to go down.

172
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:18,559
Speaker 0: During all of this, the temporary Speaker of the House, the person whose only job is to be the fake Speaker, whose only power is to elect a new Speaker...

173
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,196
Speaker 1: Yeah, he can't go and bring up some other laws or anything to vote.

174
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,412
Speaker 1: See what he did?

175
00:12:22,494 --> 00:12:22,760
Speaker 1: He kicked...

176
00:12:23,402 --> 00:12:29,080
Speaker 0: A bunch of Democrats, who he personally hates, out of their offices in the Capitol to put Republicans in them.

177
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,096
Speaker 1: That's the kind of petty, childish things that they do.

178
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:31,580
Speaker 1: That's not new.

179
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,444
Speaker 0: Just to be a prick.

180
00:12:33,811 --> 00:12:35,439
Speaker 0: And while that could be its own...

181
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:36,685
Speaker 1: Get ready to lose.

182
00:12:36,745 --> 00:12:39,800
Speaker 1: Get ready to see what happens to you when you're not in charge.

183
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:51,528
Speaker 0: So, the Democrats who were kicked out, actually, to their credit, instead of making a big stink and fighting a lawsuit and all this sort of nonsense, they basically just said, "That's exactly what the Republicans are like.

184
00:12:52,612 --> 00:12:54,138
Speaker 0: I can't believe how petty this is.

185
00:12:54,158 --> 00:12:54,600
Speaker 0: Whatever.

186
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,047
Speaker 0: Tell me what my office is.

187
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:56,973
Speaker 0: You have to give me at least

188
00:12:57,114 --> 00:12:57,194
Speaker 0: one.".

189
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:58,844
Speaker 1: Eh.

190
00:12:58,884 --> 00:12:59,226
Speaker 1: Whatever.

191
00:12:59,728 --> 00:13:00,934
Speaker 1: Be like, "All right.

192
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,276
Speaker 1: Go.

193
00:13:01,336 --> 00:13:01,537
Speaker 1: I don't

194
00:13:01,557 --> 00:13:01,758
Speaker 1: care.".

195
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:11,100
Speaker 0: This is newsworthy in that this is historic, and this is the most dysfunctional thing that has happened in the House of Representatives ever.

196
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,580
Speaker 1: It's gonna get more dysfunctional.

197
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,467
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

198
00:13:13,811 --> 00:13:14,699
Speaker 0: It's like that Simpsons meme.

199
00:13:15,081 --> 00:13:17,479
Speaker 0: The most dysfunctional thing to ever happen so far.

200
00:13:18,742 --> 00:13:18,842
Speaker 1: Eh.

201
00:13:19,726 --> 00:13:20,047
Speaker 1: Whatever.

202
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:21,633
Speaker 1: At least it's entertaining.

203
00:13:21,654 --> 00:13:23,260
Speaker 1: It'd be boring if everything was just normal.

204
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,551
Speaker 0: I don't like that.

205
00:13:27,671 --> 00:13:40,319
Speaker 0: some people, especially people who claim to be centrists, which is just a coward's way of saying you're actually conservative, but I don't like people who treat horse trading politics as direct entertainment because people die based on these decisions.

206
00:13:41,161 --> 00:13:43,620
Speaker 0: Racist governments cause racist actions that hurt people.

207
00:13:44,201 --> 00:13:55,400
Speaker 0: But this is entertaining partly because the Democrats are actually using their power to its fullest extent and pointing out what a clown show the Republicans are.

208
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,959
Speaker 0: They're both doing the right thing with the full extended power.

209
00:13:58,582 --> 00:14:02,119
Speaker 1: They're doing all they can do without trying to break the rules or anything.

210
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:07,060
Speaker 0: The only thing they can do more than they are doing right now is literally start a coup.

211
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,780
Speaker 1: Everyone is doing what is within their power to do.

212
00:14:11,961 --> 00:14:13,620
Speaker 1: That's what I fully expect, right?

213
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,025
Speaker 1: Yep.

214
00:14:15,367 --> 00:14:17,260
Speaker 0: It's heartening and we'll see how this goes.

215
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,500
Speaker 0: So speaking of clown shows, you want to talk about Travis Scott?

216
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:21,721
Speaker 1: Yeah.

217
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:26,800
Speaker 1: Well, so everyone knows, we talk about this frequently on Geek Nights, right?

218
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:41,980
Speaker 1: That even though we hate capitalism, there is a reality in this world that some things have necessarily, not unnecessarily, we hate it when it's unnecessary and false scarcity, artificial scarcity, but some things are literally scarce, right?

219
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:53,079
Speaker 1: And the easiest example to go to that a lot of people encounter in their lives are tickets to concerts and other such venues because the event happens once.

220
00:14:53,842 --> 00:14:59,160
Speaker 1: We're not going to play World Series Game 4 several times so that everyone can see it, right?

221
00:14:59,261 --> 00:15:00,939
Speaker 1: It's like it's happening once.

222
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,291
Speaker 1: There are only so many seats in the stadium.

223
00:15:03,814 --> 00:15:04,659
Speaker 1: That's it, right?

224
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:07,170
Speaker 0: You can't just magically make more appear.

225
00:15:07,391 --> 00:15:09,220
Speaker 0: There's even a culture book about that.

226
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:28,579
Speaker 0: You didn't read this one, but that culture book has an event where a supernova is going to happen and there's a limited radius where people can see it directly with their own eyes and the culture accidentally reinvents money just for the sole purpose of people being able to go to this show because it'll literally only ever happen once.

227
00:15:29,522 --> 00:15:30,264
Speaker 1: Yep, exactly.

228
00:15:30,324 --> 00:15:41,620
Speaker 1: So, people get mad because what happens is the people who run concerts and other events sell tickets at too low a price even though the demand exceeds the supply.

229
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,390
Speaker 0: Too low by economic standards.

230
00:15:43,672 --> 00:15:44,780
Speaker 0: We're not talking about society.

231
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,479
Speaker 0: We're not talking about whether or not this is good or evil or whatever.

232
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:58,260
Speaker 1: And when you do that, inevitably, there's nothing you can do about this, is that somebody will buy the tickets and sell them for a higher price and basically make a margin on that.

233
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,384
Speaker 0: This is called arbitrage.

234
00:15:59,505 --> 00:16:08,160
Speaker 0: If Scott buys something for $20 that RIM is willing to buy for $50, Scott can sell it to RIM for $50 and make a profit, and that is expected.

235
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,840
Speaker 0: That is like mechanism design 101 that that will happen.

236
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:25,273
Speaker 1: The only way to avoid this, which people, I guess, would also be upset about, would be if the original ticket price was the highest price the market would pay, in which case people would be mad because Taylor Swift tickets would be like $5,000, $10,000, right?

237
00:16:29,344 --> 00:16:32,220
Speaker 1: On the face value, and people wouldn't go for that, right?

238
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,240
Speaker 0: You're talking about when MagFest sells out.

239
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:45,918
Speaker 0: If they just sold MagFest at the maximum price that would sell out MagFest at all the hotels, I would pay several hundred dollars to go to a MagFest, but not everyone can afford that, but that's what the price would be.

240
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:46,900
Speaker 1: Right.

241
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:59,180
Speaker 1: Regardless, so the problem is because of this scenario, a lot of people get into this business of being ticket brokers and using bots and other various means to scoop up tickets, right?

242
00:16:59,402 --> 00:17:01,040
Speaker 1: And then resell them and make a profit.

243
00:17:01,381 --> 00:17:01,582
Speaker 1: Okay.

244
00:17:01,683 --> 00:17:02,828
Speaker 1: We know all that story.

245
00:17:03,371 --> 00:17:05,380
Speaker 1: It is an additional story, right?

246
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:15,858
Speaker 1: People in the United States and around the world have credit cards, and when you pay for something with a credit card, the person you bought something from has to pay a fee, the merchant's fee, right?

247
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:20,760
Speaker 1: And that merchant's fee goes to the bank, right?

248
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:23,260
Speaker 1: If it's like a Chase Bank credit card, Chase gets some money.

249
00:17:23,723 --> 00:17:25,979
Speaker 1: If it's a Visa credit card, Visa gets some money.

250
00:17:26,681 --> 00:17:29,594
Speaker 1: And to encourage you, right?

251
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:33,640
Speaker 1: Because that's where they make all their money, is from you swiping their credit card, right?

252
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,880
Speaker 1: They get the merchant, the person you swiped at pays them.

253
00:17:37,321 --> 00:17:39,560
Speaker 1: They want you to use that credit card all the fucking time.

254
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:39,800
Speaker 1: Yup.

255
00:17:39,921 --> 00:17:45,640
Speaker 0: I mean, there's a reason why I am very willing to be the one who swipes my credit card when I rent a big Airbnb for all my friends.

256
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:45,781
Speaker 1: Yeah.

257
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:47,659
Speaker 1: When you're swiping a credit card, right?

258
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:54,340
Speaker 1: And so when you swipe your credit card, they encourage you to do this by sharing some of that with you, right?

259
00:17:54,580 --> 00:18:07,660
Speaker 1: So basically, every time you swipe your credit card at any business, that person who runs that business pays MasterCard or whoever the fuck, and then they, in turn, pay you back some of the money with rewards.

260
00:18:08,122 --> 00:18:12,320
Speaker 1: And the only person who gets screwed by credit cards are businesses that accept credit cards.

261
00:18:12,581 --> 00:18:12,741
Speaker 1: Yup.

262
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:17,780
Speaker 0: I got status on an airline solely from one swipe when I rented that beach house for everybody.

263
00:18:18,581 --> 00:18:18,803
Speaker 1: Right.

264
00:18:18,863 --> 00:18:28,159
Speaker 1: It's like, you can, the airline, basically airlines make more of their money from people swiping airline credit cards all around the world than they do from selling plane tickets, right?

265
00:18:28,762 --> 00:18:41,020
Speaker 1: Because they're getting a trickle in of all those little bits of money from all these swipes everywhere, and those swipes turn into points, and as long as the points aren't spent, which a lot of them aren't, they just sit in a pile of money like a bank.

266
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:45,580
Speaker 1: And that's where all the wealth of airlines is, not in selling plane tickets.

267
00:18:46,082 --> 00:19:03,540
Speaker 1: Anyway, so here's the thing, if you are someone who has a credit card, if you knew for certain, absolute certain, that you could buy something and then resell the something at or higher than the price you bought it for, even if you had no interest in that something.

268
00:19:04,022 --> 00:19:11,959
Speaker 1: So if I knew for certain that I could buy a Taylor Swift concert ticket and resell it for more than I paid, which I do know that.

269
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,180
Speaker 0: If you could even resell it for as low as slightly less than you paid, you'd still break certain.

270
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,220
Speaker 1: Right, but that's besides the point, right?

271
00:19:19,562 --> 00:19:27,499
Speaker 1: If I know that I can buy a Taylor Swift concert ticket with my credit card and then sell it, and at the same price or greater or slightly less, like Rym said, right?

272
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:37,019
Speaker 1: Then I will profit because even though I didn't keep the ticket and I didn't make any money on the arbitrage, I got points for using my credit card.

273
00:19:37,521 --> 00:19:50,479
Speaker 1: So there is a community of people online who basically are trying to constantly max out, get lots of credit cards, max them out, but then max them out by buying things that they then resell.

274
00:19:51,643 --> 00:19:54,640
Speaker 1: So basically they can always pay off their credit card in full.

275
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,739
Speaker 1: They didn't actually lose any money, but they got shit tons of points and rewards and cash back.

276
00:20:01,221 --> 00:20:06,360
Speaker 1: And they're profiting just by buying things and selling things that they don't even fucking want, right?

277
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:20,340
Speaker 1: And so this is a perfect storm because concert tickets set up systems to try to stop bots, but individual people with credit cards, legitimate actual people, not bots, right?

278
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,399
Speaker 1: If you can organize those people and say, "Hey, I'm putting the word out.

279
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:34,978
Speaker 1: Anyone out there who has a credit card, if you buy Taylor Swift tickets, I will buy them from you at like a 10% markup guaranteed, I swear, right?

280
00:20:35,962 --> 00:20:38,620
Speaker 1: If you do this, you'll get credit card points.

281
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,760
Speaker 1: Let's all team up and I'll be the one to sell all the tickets.

282
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,520
Speaker 1: You won't have to take the risk of trying to find a buyer, right?

283
00:20:45,781 --> 00:20:48,040
Speaker 1: I'm guaranteeing you this markup, right?

284
00:20:48,501 --> 00:20:50,594
Speaker 1: And then I'll take on the risk of finding actual

285
00:20:50,635 --> 00:20:51,037
Speaker 1: buyers.".

286
00:20:51,520 --> 00:21:03,277
Speaker 0: And that is how capital markets arbitrage works is a series of steps like this where someone assumes a risk and then someone else basically underwrites that risk by saying, "No, I'll assume that

287
00:21:03,377 --> 00:21:03,639
Speaker 0: risk.".

288
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,959
Speaker 0: And everyone's taking a piece along the way.

289
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,500
Speaker 1: So there's a company that did exactly that.

290
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:16,953
Speaker 1: They would put out the word and they would say, "Hey, all you people who want to max out your credit cards and get points, buy this and I will buy it from you, right?

291
00:21:17,837 --> 00:21:18,078
Speaker 1: Do it

292
00:21:18,118 --> 00:21:18,278
Speaker 1: now.".

293
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,840
Speaker 1: And so people would go buy the tickets, they sold it to the company, it worked.

294
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,580
Speaker 1: Those people got credit card points.

295
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:28,120
Speaker 1: That company got tickets, they resold the tickets, they made money.

296
00:21:29,448 --> 00:21:30,100
Speaker 1: It actually worked.

297
00:21:30,765 --> 00:21:32,740
Speaker 1: People don't like it, but that was happening.

298
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,878
Speaker 1: It's a thing, the only solution is the one we discussed.

299
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,400
Speaker 0: I can't even actually argue that it's particularly unethical.

300
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,260
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, that's a thing that's happened.

301
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,479
Speaker 1: So here's the funny part, right?

302
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,120
Speaker 1: That risk was never eliminated, right?

303
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,760
Speaker 1: You think that sounds like the least risky thing ever.

304
00:21:50,841 --> 00:21:52,979
Speaker 1: Of course you can resell the Taylor Swift tickets, right?

305
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,597
Speaker 1: Well, the company said, "All right, let's do the Travis Scott

306
00:21:56,617 --> 00:21:56,939
Speaker 1: tickets.".

307
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,580
Speaker 0: Now you might remember, there's an important piece of information.

308
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,600
Speaker 1: Travis Scott, who is incredibly popular, he's like insane popular.

309
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:16,839
Speaker 0: But he had a concert in 2021 that, due to poor crowd control and fucked up, there's a whole report on who is responsible for this, 10 people were killed by a massive crowd crush.

310
00:22:17,241 --> 00:22:18,099
Speaker 1: No, that's true.

311
00:22:19,223 --> 00:22:22,160
Speaker 1: But regardless, this guy is still insanely popular.

312
00:22:22,601 --> 00:22:26,920
Speaker 1: He's chart-topping, streaming, big, big popular artist.

313
00:22:27,283 --> 00:22:29,159
Speaker 1: You got to imagine his shows are going to sell out.

314
00:22:29,684 --> 00:22:31,400
Speaker 1: And the demand will be higher than the supply.

315
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,918
Speaker 1: So the company says, "All right, everybody, go buy the tickets with your credit

316
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:35,240
Speaker 1: cards.".

317
00:22:36,062 --> 00:22:37,439
Speaker 1: And guess what happened?

318
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,360
Speaker 1: Uh-oh, the demand, we don't know why.

319
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,280
Speaker 1: It could be the reason Rims suggested people are afraid of dying.

320
00:22:44,481 --> 00:22:46,776
Speaker 1: It could be that he's not as popular now.

321
00:22:46,837 --> 00:22:47,279
Speaker 1: Who knows?

322
00:22:47,922 --> 00:22:49,279
Speaker 1: But the demand was not there.

323
00:22:50,022 --> 00:22:53,580
Speaker 1: And the company that assumed the risk cannot resell the tickets.

324
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,319
Speaker 0: People are buying good tickets for as low as $14 on Stuff Hub right now.

325
00:22:58,923 --> 00:22:59,185
Speaker 1: Right.

326
00:22:59,285 --> 00:23:07,420
Speaker 1: So basically, people bought the tickets with their credit cards, and some of them were not able to get paid back from the company that's centralizing all this.

327
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,480
Speaker 1: And now they're trying to, people trying to max out their credit cards got hosed.

328
00:23:11,942 --> 00:23:22,340
Speaker 1: And then the company that told everyone to max out their credit cards is also getting hosed, sitting on a pile of tickets that they can't sell for even face value because no one wants to go to the concert.

329
00:23:23,962 --> 00:23:36,500
Speaker 1: And, you know, the winner in this case would be Travis Scott, who sold out, he sold out his concert, whereas if there hadn't been people trying to arbitrage, he would not have sold out his concert and made less money.

330
00:23:36,901 --> 00:23:43,340
Speaker 1: So he's very happy about this whole situation, even though his concert won't be that crowded, but his concert wouldn't have been crowded anyway.

331
00:23:43,702 --> 00:23:47,260
Speaker 1: Even if this didn't happen, his concert still would have had the same audience.

332
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,261
Speaker 0: And his concert might now actually get more crowded if people could buy tickets for $14.

333
00:23:53,261 --> 00:23:56,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, more people might actually come now that the prices are tanked.

334
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:02,340
Speaker 1: But all the people trying to do the scam have gotten screwed, which is just kind of hilarious.

335
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:36,992
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, because that is, you know, capitalism, I guess, as a professional in capitalism, based on my day job, I would say that one of the most important controls on a capitalist system, one that the lack of such controls is one of the main reasons why capitalism tends to hurt people so badly and concentrate wealth so profoundly, is that if you are making a profit and all you are providing to make that profit is an assumption of risk, then if the risk comes to pass,

336
00:24:37,274 --> 00:24:37,434
Speaker 1: you

337
00:24:37,595 --> 00:24:38,420
Speaker 0: must get fucked.

338
00:24:38,941 --> 00:24:41,400
Speaker 0: Otherwise, you are making a profit for nothing.

339
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:49,380
Speaker 0: So these people getting fucked is good by most measures, by moral measures, by capitalist measures.

340
00:24:49,701 --> 00:24:56,580
Speaker 0: Capitalism would be less cruel if more people who were only paid by assuming risk got fucked more often by that risk.

341
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:08,880
Speaker 1: Yep, the bad parts of capitalism, it's usually a situation where people fucked around and did not find out, or someone made someone else find out when they're the ones who fucked around, right?

342
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,060
Speaker 1: Like all the banks that got bailed out instead of when they should have gone to prison.

343
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:26,819
Speaker 0: Or big brain theory, situations like the existence of 401(k)s, which was a big part of why pensions went away, where that basically guarantees that anyone who makes money is throwing money into the stock market, thus perpetuating a cycle of the number has to always go up.

344
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:27,880
Speaker 1: Yep.

345
00:25:28,603 --> 00:25:36,719
Speaker 1: Anyway, this is just a hilarious situation, and it's a topic that we talk about often, and I'm sure we will talk about again, but it's a new twist.

346
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:51,379
Speaker 1: But it does make me think, though, that the credit card part of it is not really the worst idea, and if you do come across something where you are absolutely certain, like, you have to be really certain, right?

347
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,680
Speaker 1: Like a Taylor Swift concert.

348
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,000
Speaker 1: If you're only 90%, that's not good enough, right?

349
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,820
Speaker 0: I mean, remember those guys who pooled in the $10,000 to bet on a cricket match while it was going, and the team was up by like 100, and then they lost?

350
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:13,319
Speaker 1: Right, it's like, you gotta be so certain that the thing you are buying is going to be able to be resold at, or at least at the value you paid.

351
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:31,399
Speaker 1: If you're that certain of that, even if it's a thing you don't want, if the value of it is high enough, it may be worth it to buy it with your credit card and then resell it just to get points, and it's like, if that doesn't take too much effort that it's, you know, worth your time, maybe do it?

352
00:26:31,821 --> 00:26:32,044
Speaker 1: Right?

353
00:26:32,165 --> 00:26:33,340
Speaker 1: It's better than casino.

354
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:39,975
Speaker 1: It's, you know, it's probably less risky than the stock market if, if, the biggest.

355
00:26:40,115 --> 00:26:42,120
Speaker 1: if, you really have that certainty.

356
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,008
Speaker 1: Like, so certain.

357
00:26:44,048 --> 00:26:46,200
Speaker 1: We're talking, like, Super Bowl ticket certainty.

358
00:26:47,122 --> 00:26:49,116
Speaker 1: Like, you know you can resell them.

359
00:26:49,176 --> 00:26:49,720
Speaker 1: No question.

360
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,478
Speaker 1: But I guess even there, there's a risk that the Super Bowl can be cancelled.

361
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,200
Speaker 0: It might not necessarily work out if the team, like...

362
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:56,967
Speaker 1: No, it might not.

363
00:26:57,048 --> 00:27:00,073
Speaker 1: No, it has to be really... But it's like, even the Super Bowl can get cancelled.

364
00:27:00,093 --> 00:27:00,959
Speaker 1: There's always a risk.

365
00:27:01,422 --> 00:27:04,656
Speaker 1: But I think Super Bowl cancelled is a less risk than...

366
00:27:10,263 --> 00:27:13,120
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day!

367
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:25,000
Speaker 0: So, a long time ago, like, a decade or more ago, I had a thing of the day that was, like, an AMV that implied that Speed Racer was actually a bad person who hurt people.

368
00:27:26,403 --> 00:27:29,600
Speaker 1: Speed Racer is a bad person who hurts people and has monkey labor.

369
00:27:30,005 --> 00:27:31,159
Speaker 1: Child and monkey labor.

370
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,619
Speaker 0: I mean, how many people...

371
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,319
Speaker 1: In his employ.

372
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,460
Speaker 0: There are so many episodes of Speed Racer where he just rams someone off the road and the car explodes, and no one seems to hear shit.

373
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,935
Speaker 1: This car has guns that shoot people, and it's like...

374
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:58,079
Speaker 0: But, uh, I have found an entire corner of the internet of people who basically just make long-form, relatively high production value videos, really highlighting the violence and the evil of Speed Racer, and this is the best of them that I have seen.

375
00:27:59,005 --> 00:27:59,940
Speaker 1: He's really evil.

376
00:28:00,803 --> 00:28:01,269
Speaker 1: Cars.

377
00:28:01,877 --> 00:28:02,080
Speaker 1: Bad.

378
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:05,353
Speaker 0: This is titled "Speed Racer's Vehicle of

379
00:28:05,634 --> 00:28:05,955
Speaker 0: Violence.".

380
00:28:08,301 --> 00:28:15,460
Speaker 1: Well, you know, as my news suggested, we on Geek Nights love to discuss gambling and how you shouldn't do it, ever.

381
00:28:17,181 --> 00:28:19,400
Speaker 1: Even though we'll talk about it constantly.

382
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,419
Speaker 0: I'm playing this gambling game right now while we talk.

383
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,181
Speaker 1: Yeah.

384
00:28:23,004 --> 00:28:27,700
Speaker 1: And one of the gamblings that you should never, ever, ever do, under any circumstance, is video poker.

385
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,579
Speaker 1: Video poker is, like, one of the worst things you can put money into.

386
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,820
Speaker 1: Basically, like, it's 'cause it has this illusion that you have some sort of control or skill involved, right?

387
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,880
Speaker 1: 'Cause you're actually deciding to hold cards and draw other cards, right?

388
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,620
Speaker 1: But, a video poker machine is just a slot machine in disguise.

389
00:28:46,781 --> 00:28:47,063
Speaker 1: Yup.

390
00:28:47,265 --> 00:28:49,440
Speaker 1: And the payouts are terrible.

391
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,244
Speaker 0: Well, you know what it is?

392
00:28:50,264 --> 00:28:56,599
Speaker 0: It's a slot machine where you can't be better at it with skill, but if you are very stupid, you will somehow be worse at it.

393
00:28:57,265 --> 00:28:58,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can misclick or make a mistake.

394
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:03,860
Speaker 0: It measures a slot machine where, if you pull the lever too slow, you're less likely to win.

395
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,018
Speaker 0: That's what video poker is.

396
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:05,621
Speaker 1: Yeah.

397
00:29:05,682 --> 00:29:07,840
Speaker 1: Video poker is just avoid it at all costs.

398
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:12,220
Speaker 1: But, video poker, the game, I guess, right?

399
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:17,780
Speaker 1: If you take away the real money part of it, is just sort of this aesthetic thing, right?

400
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,120
Speaker 1: Like, sitting at a video poker machine.

401
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,340
Speaker 1: It's sort of a unique kind of machine with a unique display and art style and sounds.

402
00:29:25,521 --> 00:29:28,519
Speaker 1: And, you know, it's this kind of experience of just playing it.

403
00:29:29,741 --> 00:29:36,380
Speaker 1: So, somebody, it's kind of awesome, they made this classic video poker on a website.

404
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:45,660
Speaker 1: So, you go to this website and just, like, this perfect, like, scanline, CRT-looking, like, video poker just loads.

405
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,349
Speaker 1: And you can play it with, they give you $25.

406
00:29:48,349 --> 00:29:51,520
Speaker 1: It's just the number 25 is on the screen, right?

407
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:57,421
Speaker 1: And you can just play, and if you run out of money, you can reload and go back to $25.

408
00:29:57,421 --> 00:30:02,140
Speaker 1: It's just a video poker clone, basically, but it's just the feeling of playing it.

409
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,059
Speaker 0: The sound effects it makes are real good.

410
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:04,801
Speaker 1: Yeah.

411
00:30:04,921 --> 00:30:10,780
Speaker 1: It's just on the money and, you know, if you have any urge to play video poker, just play this.

412
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,567
Speaker 1: Hooray.

413
00:30:12,668 --> 00:30:13,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's about all you're going to win.

414
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:20,420
Speaker 1: Just play this and you can sort of get all of the good parts, you know, whatever good parts video poker has are here.

415
00:30:21,042 --> 00:30:24,940
Speaker 1: And the "guaranteed you're going to lose your money" part is not here because it's free.

416
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,760
Speaker 0: It's just the website.

417
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:31,240
Speaker 0: Alright, in the meta moment, the Geek nuts book club book, the murder bot diary.

418
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:37,960
Speaker 0: Once diaries, once we, the next one comes out, we'll read that and then we'll give you guys a few weeks to read it and then we'll do a show on it.

419
00:30:38,341 --> 00:30:40,919
Speaker 0: I am five murder bots in.

420
00:30:42,141 --> 00:30:42,262
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

421
00:30:42,827 --> 00:30:44,078
Speaker 1: I am all the murder bots in.

422
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,619
Speaker 0: Yep, you've gotten a little more murder bot than me.

423
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:51,159
Speaker 1: Literally all of it, except for what's going to be published very soon.

424
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,920
Speaker 0: They are very, very fast reads.

425
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,100
Speaker 0: Otherwise, we're going to be at PAX with not one, but two panels.

426
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,640
Speaker 0: Well, two events and it looks like the schedule just got published, so I'll make a post about it now.

427
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,519
Speaker 1: But only one of our events is on the schedule.

428
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:09,120
Speaker 0: Oh, I guess the learn and play schedule is not published yet.

429
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,808
Speaker 1: Oh, I think that is the event.

430
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:12,500
Speaker 1: I think the other one is not on the schedule.

431
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,106
Speaker 0: Well, there you go, because we're definitely doing two.

432
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:17,800
Speaker 0: We are doing on one day, I had the note up, I got to post later.

433
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:23,760
Speaker 0: Anyway, one of the days we are doing a brand new panel, mastering game mechanics, worker placement.

434
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:29,098
Speaker 0: Rem and Scott talking about nothing but worker placement mechanics for 59 minutes.

435
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,640
Speaker 0: It's going to be glorious.

436
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,360
Speaker 1: And that is not on the official schedule yet.

437
00:31:33,621 --> 00:31:36,100
Speaker 0: We are doing a learn and play and win.

438
00:31:36,441 --> 00:31:41,980
Speaker 0: We're going to teach you all how to be good at Wist, Hearts, and Wizard.

439
00:31:43,581 --> 00:31:44,850
Speaker 1: That is on the schedule.

440
00:31:45,052 --> 00:31:46,140
Speaker 1: That is on the PAX website.

441
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:46,868
Speaker 0: It's going to be exciting.

442
00:31:46,928 --> 00:31:47,900
Speaker 0: I'm looking forward to that one.

443
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,646
Speaker 0: We're not going to actually play Wist.

444
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:53,280
Speaker 0: We're going to do one hand of Wist with everyone because Wist is not worth playing.

445
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,740
Speaker 0: It's basically just how to learn to do trick taking.

446
00:31:57,723 --> 00:31:58,630
Speaker 0: But we will teach Wist.

447
00:31:58,731 --> 00:31:59,779
Speaker 0: Wist is a pretty simple game.

448
00:32:03,022 --> 00:32:03,526
Speaker 0: Any other meta?

449
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,158
Speaker 0: I guess we can talk about the website.

450
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:15,597
Speaker 1: We are going to attempt to launch the New Geek Guys website on Saturday, October 2 days from now.

451
00:32:15,677 --> 00:32:15,737
Speaker 1: 7th?

452
00:32:15,777 --> 00:32:15,817
Speaker 1: 7th.

453
00:32:18,062 --> 00:32:19,110
Speaker 1: We'll see how that goes.

454
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:19,795
Speaker 1: It might fail.

455
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:20,379
Speaker 1: We could revert.

456
00:32:25,563 --> 00:32:28,420
Speaker 1: Rem is obsessed with this new noise he found.

457
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,480
Speaker 0: That new noise I found is the announcement sound anytime I join a Discord voice chat now.

458
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, mine is much better than that.

459
00:32:34,562 --> 00:32:37,840
Speaker 0: I made it as long as possible to be as annoying as possible.

460
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,437
Speaker 1: Yeah, see mine is this one.

461
00:32:41,564 --> 00:32:42,439
Speaker 0: That's a real good one.

462
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,268
Speaker 1: That's as bad as good as it gets.

463
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:45,938
Speaker 1: I couldn't think of anything better.

464
00:32:46,018 --> 00:32:46,280
Speaker 1: Anyway.

465
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,296
Speaker 0: It's the elephant sound.

466
00:32:48,121 --> 00:32:48,624
Speaker 1: That's right.

467
00:32:49,268 --> 00:32:50,395
Speaker 1: I'm coming in like an elephant.

468
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:51,059
Speaker 0: Watch the fuck out.

469
00:32:51,661 --> 00:32:52,619
Speaker 1: It's a spider elephant.

470
00:32:53,701 --> 00:32:55,156
Speaker 1: Elephant bit by radioactive spider.

471
00:32:55,237 --> 00:32:55,419
Speaker 1: Anyway.

472
00:32:56,562 --> 00:32:57,486
Speaker 1: So yeah, it might work.

473
00:32:57,547 --> 00:32:58,070
Speaker 1: It might not.

474
00:32:58,552 --> 00:32:59,155
Speaker 1: You might like it.

475
00:32:59,175 --> 00:32:59,980
Speaker 1: You might not like it.

476
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:00,948
Speaker 1: That's tough cookies.

477
00:33:01,029 --> 00:33:01,494
Speaker 1: We like it.

478
00:33:01,534 --> 00:33:02,140
Speaker 1: We're going with it.

479
00:33:02,984 --> 00:33:06,540
Speaker 1: It does enough that it can replace the current website.

480
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:10,060
Speaker 1: We're going to continue to work on it because the code is so updated.

481
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:15,778
Speaker 1: It's actually very easy to work on and update this website since the code isn't 10+ years old.

482
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,544
Speaker 1: It's modern.

483
00:33:17,866 --> 00:33:20,060
Speaker 1: It auto deploys all kinds of fancy shit.

484
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,379
Speaker 1: And that code will be on GitHub.

485
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:29,079
Speaker 1: And you can send us pull requests or whatever and help work on it for no money if that's what you want to do.

486
00:33:31,102 --> 00:33:32,167
Speaker 1: And yeah, that's exciting.

487
00:33:32,228 --> 00:33:34,720
Speaker 1: Finally, we talked so long and shit talking.

488
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,419
Speaker 1: But no, it's going to be for real.

489
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:42,880
Speaker 1: And if there's any, you know, you can even just send suggestions in the GitHub issues if you want, you know.

490
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:43,641
Speaker 0: Yeah.

491
00:33:44,325 --> 00:33:46,858
Speaker 0: And from there we can start to do it.

492
00:33:47,241 --> 00:33:49,539
Speaker 0: Once we've got it live and all the kinks are ironed out.

493
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:52,279
Speaker 0: That's where we can start to do some new stuff.

494
00:33:52,903 --> 00:33:53,892
Speaker 0: We can dig into the hopper.

495
00:33:54,174 --> 00:33:54,840
Speaker 0: The Geek Nights hopper.

496
00:33:55,344 --> 00:33:55,509
Speaker 1: Yeah.

497
00:33:55,611 --> 00:33:55,899
Speaker 1: That's right.

498
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,060
Speaker 0: We kept talking about it, but we never actually did it.

499
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,799
Speaker 0: We didn't add the new bit we were talking about at the end of the show.

500
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,200
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, we talk about a lot of things that we don't do.

501
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:05,379
Speaker 0: We do talk about a lot of things.

502
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,159
Speaker 1: But then sometimes we do them.

503
00:34:09,282 --> 00:34:10,690
Speaker 0: And our worker placement panel is on.

504
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,920
Speaker 0: I actually pulled it up from this internal.

505
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:18,100
Speaker 0: Saturday 2.30 PM in the Crab God Theater.

506
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,739
Speaker 1: All right, let me see.

507
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,550
Speaker 0: Feel free to announce it to the world.

508
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,000
Speaker 0: It is by no means a secret.

509
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:23,942
Speaker 1: I see.

510
00:34:23,982 --> 00:34:26,820
Speaker 1: The Crab God Theater is not yet listed in the list of locations.

511
00:34:27,422 --> 00:34:27,583
Speaker 0: Ah.

512
00:34:27,764 --> 00:34:30,998
Speaker 0: I wonder what other secrets the Crab God is hiding from us.

513
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,360
Speaker 0: All right.

514
00:34:32,743 --> 00:34:37,219
Speaker 0: So on Geek Nights we've reviewed things like video games.

515
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,739
Speaker 0: We've reviewed conventions.

516
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,320
Speaker 0: We've reviewed concerts.

517
00:34:41,061 --> 00:34:44,179
Speaker 0: I don't see why we can't review an Apple Fest that we went to upstate.

518
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,560
Speaker 1: So I've been to this Apple Fest before.

519
00:34:47,184 --> 00:34:48,560
Speaker 1: New York is the Empire State.

520
00:34:49,603 --> 00:34:50,840
Speaker 1: Apples are sort of our thing.

521
00:34:51,261 --> 00:34:53,138
Speaker 1: There's a lot of fucking apple orchards here.

522
00:34:54,348 --> 00:34:54,960
Speaker 1: Apple Seasons.

523
00:34:55,081 --> 00:34:56,478
Speaker 0: If you live out of the U.S.

524
00:34:56,801 --> 00:34:59,120
Speaker 0: I feel like a lot of people who live outside of the U.S.

525
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,649
Speaker 0: At least have this impression that like Yeah, Americans.

526
00:35:01,689 --> 00:35:02,900
Speaker 0: There's something with them and apples.

527
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,633
Speaker 0: Because apples are very...

528
00:35:05,563 --> 00:35:06,780
Speaker 1: New York is the big apple.

529
00:35:08,703 --> 00:35:11,260
Speaker 0: Johnny Appleseed is a full hero in America.

530
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,380
Speaker 0: Even though the Disney movie is very wrong about what he was doing.

531
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:15,844
Speaker 0: Spoilers.

532
00:35:16,086 --> 00:35:17,560
Speaker 0: He was making fucking apple whiskey.

533
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,698
Speaker 0: He was making alcohol.

534
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,180
Speaker 0: He was not making apple fritters or apple pies.

535
00:35:23,581 --> 00:35:25,937
Speaker 1: Places have their local crops.

536
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,779
Speaker 1: You go to Columbia, get some coffee.

537
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,460
Speaker 1: Go to New York, get some apples.

538
00:35:31,766 --> 00:35:32,459
Speaker 1: It's apple season.

539
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,558
Speaker 1: And there's a town in New York State.

540
00:35:35,042 --> 00:35:36,180
Speaker 1: It's not part of New York City.

541
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,798
Speaker 1: It's New York State called Warwick.

542
00:35:38,521 --> 00:35:41,279
Speaker 1: And it's a cute little quaint country home kind of town.

543
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,839
Speaker 0: It's about an hour north of the city.

544
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,320
Speaker 0: Unless there's typical traffic.

545
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,759
Speaker 0: In which case it's two and a half hour.

546
00:35:46,401 --> 00:35:48,520
Speaker 1: It's just north of New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

547
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,459
Speaker 1: A little bit west and a little bit north.

548
00:35:50,944 --> 00:35:52,579
Speaker 0: Yep, Emily and I got some family out there.

549
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,140
Speaker 1: And that place is all about apples.

550
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,099
Speaker 1: There are many apple orchards in range.

551
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,820
Speaker 1: Short range of the little town of Warwick.

552
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,440
Speaker 1: And so every year they have an apple festival.

553
00:36:07,282 --> 00:36:10,580
Speaker 1: That apple festival I think might have been cancelled during the dark times.

554
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,139
Speaker 1: But I went to it once before.

555
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,240
Speaker 0: I had been to it zero times before.

556
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,499
Speaker 0: Because relatives, the same relatives we met when we went up there.

557
00:36:19,123 --> 00:36:21,558
Speaker 0: And we asked them this past weekend, "Hey, do you want to meet us

558
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:21,779
Speaker 0: there?".

559
00:36:22,161 --> 00:36:24,772
Speaker 0: And their response was, "Fuck no.

560
00:36:25,194 --> 00:36:26,118
Speaker 0: That's a crowded

561
00:36:26,198 --> 00:36:26,580
Speaker 0: nightmare.".

562
00:36:27,401 --> 00:36:29,480
Speaker 1: Well I know you've been to Warwick, but you didn't go to the apple festival.

563
00:36:29,944 --> 00:36:31,600
Speaker 0: No, I have never been to the apple fest before.

564
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,920
Speaker 0: Because in the past, I had the perception that it is extremely crowded.

565
00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:36,599
Speaker 1: It is crowded, yes.

566
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:40,220
Speaker 1: So, we went to the apple festival again.

567
00:36:40,821 --> 00:36:41,617
Speaker 1: A second time.

568
00:36:42,621 --> 00:36:44,300
Speaker 1: Because I needed some fucking apples.

569
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:47,299
Speaker 1: Apple season was coming to an end.

570
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,440
Speaker 1: And usually you can go to the apple festival and then go to a nearby orchard.

571
00:36:52,741 --> 00:36:54,800
Speaker 1: Load up on apple, donuts, and cider.

572
00:36:55,241 --> 00:36:58,420
Speaker 1: And then go home and that's a lovely day on the weekend.

573
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,540
Speaker 0: You want to talk about that first?

574
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,779
Speaker 0: Because I was really looking forward to both of these aspects of this trip.

575
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,560
Speaker 0: And after we're at the apple fest, and we'll review it in a moment.

576
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,518
Speaker 0: You know, good old time.

577
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,080
Speaker 0: We decide, let's go to an orchard.

578
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,999
Speaker 0: And we look and we figure out which one to go to.

579
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,900
Speaker 1: There's a lot of different orchards and all the orchards are different.

580
00:37:14,321 --> 00:37:19,960
Speaker 1: Some of them have tons of apples, but not too many exciting varieties.

581
00:37:20,481 --> 00:37:23,460
Speaker 1: Some of them specialize in having lots of varieties, but there's not a lot.

582
00:37:23,763 --> 00:37:24,460
Speaker 1: They're all different.

583
00:37:25,861 --> 00:37:27,240
Speaker 1: One of them's got this pizza.

584
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,240
Speaker 1: One of them is like, you know, people are just partying out in the orchard.

585
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,160
Speaker 1: Bringing out folding tables and letting their kids run wild.

586
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,100
Speaker 1: And some of them, it's like, no, people are there for picking.

587
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,480
Speaker 1: To get, you know, because they got to go make some apple shit.

588
00:37:40,822 --> 00:37:43,840
Speaker 1: And they don't let you hang out in the orchard and do other stuff, right?

589
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,580
Speaker 1: You got to hang out in their, you know, hanging out area.

590
00:37:47,702 --> 00:37:50,180
Speaker 1: So each orchard has a different kind of specialty.

591
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,280
Speaker 1: That they, you know, that's their thing.

592
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:54,320
Speaker 1: To separate themselves from the competition.

593
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,020
Speaker 0: Yup, and so we just, we pick one.

594
00:37:57,462 --> 00:37:58,558
Speaker 0: The one that we wanted to go to.

595
00:37:59,261 --> 00:38:01,720
Speaker 1: The one we picked was the one I've been to before, twice.

596
00:38:02,121 --> 00:38:03,120
Speaker 1: It's a really happening one.

597
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,110
Speaker 0: Yup, I'm 90% sure.

598
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,678
Speaker 0: I've been to that one too.

599
00:38:08,084 --> 00:38:09,458
Speaker 0: I guess, the line of cars.

600
00:38:10,602 --> 00:38:15,380
Speaker 0: To get into this orchard, however long you think I'm going to say.

601
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,200
Speaker 0: Like, put it up in order of magnitude.

602
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:27,500
Speaker 0: It was like blocking traffic so far that we weren't sure if we could even get back toward the other side of where this orchard was to go to a different one.

603
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:33,240
Speaker 1: It was hard to, it was hard to tell because it's like people are in line on a two lane road that, but it's not one way.

604
00:38:33,422 --> 00:38:35,099
Speaker 1: So it's like, yeah, everyone's lined up.

605
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:40,100
Speaker 1: And it's like if you just wanted to continue down that road and go straight and not turn into the orchard.

606
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,640
Speaker 1: You had to just wait in this line of cars that were all turning right into the orchard.

607
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,685
Speaker 0: Yup, double yellow line.

608
00:38:45,806 --> 00:38:47,880
Speaker 0: You can't pass there safely or legally.

609
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,404
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like now.

610
00:38:49,444 --> 00:38:51,152
Speaker 1: there was a way to escape from that.

611
00:38:51,212 --> 00:38:52,980
Speaker 1: thanks to Google Maps got us out of there.

612
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,960
Speaker 0: Yup, we took a serpentine path through a subdivision.

613
00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:03,120
Speaker 1: If you wanted to go in the same direction as those cars and you were beyond the turn, it's like you couldn't get it, you know.

614
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:11,600
Speaker 1: It's like I thought about trying to pull a scam where it's like, well, if we're on the side road trying to pull in and make a left, someone's going to let us in eventually.

615
00:39:12,121 --> 00:39:12,363
Speaker 1: Right.

616
00:39:12,564 --> 00:39:14,800
Speaker 1: We're not just going to sit there for infinity.

617
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:22,860
Speaker 0: I do think we would have sat there for infinity unless I took aggressive driving actions, the likes of which I am not personally willing to do.

618
00:39:23,181 --> 00:39:23,502
Speaker 1: Yeah.

619
00:39:23,542 --> 00:39:27,100
Speaker 1: So it's like, you know, yet so you have to let someone cut in line eventually.

620
00:39:27,261 --> 00:39:29,860
Speaker 1: And I bet you could lie and be like, no, no, no, I'm going to go straight.

621
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,284
Speaker 0: Here's the problem, though.

622
00:39:31,304 --> 00:39:32,007
Speaker 0: Let's say we did.

623
00:39:32,047 --> 00:39:34,959
Speaker 0: We cut in line where we would have cut in.

624
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,293
Speaker 0: I think the line was it was really long.

625
00:39:40,301 --> 00:39:44,960
Speaker 0: It was still very, very far, but at the point where we would have had to go into the orchard.

626
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:54,300
Speaker 0: Now, the person who we told that we are just passing through would then see that we have, in fact, turned into the orchard and they are changed our minds.

627
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:00,519
Speaker 0: They're now right behind us in traffic and they might have a gun.

628
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,282
Speaker 1: Fight me, bro.

629
00:40:02,844 --> 00:40:03,105
Speaker 1: No.

630
00:40:03,546 --> 00:40:03,887
Speaker 1: Yeah.

631
00:40:04,007 --> 00:40:09,080
Speaker 1: But I mean, on the one hand, the line was really long, but on the other hand, it was a car line.

632
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:17,439
Speaker 1: And the thing to remember about a car line is that it's much longer than it appears to be, because most of the space in the line is taken up by car.

633
00:40:18,261 --> 00:40:24,320
Speaker 1: The actual number of people in that line could have been like one hundred, like one hundred people waiting in line.

634
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,704
Speaker 1: It takes up almost no room.

635
00:40:25,744 --> 00:40:30,140
Speaker 1: One hundred people in cars waiting in line is as long as one hundred cars.

636
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:38,660
Speaker 0: But it's a long as, you know, based on looking at that line, it did not appear that it had moved any appreciable amount at any point.

637
00:40:39,261 --> 00:40:39,643
Speaker 1: Well, no.

638
00:40:39,723 --> 00:40:43,920
Speaker 1: See, that's the thing is like if we could have physically gotten to the orchard, we would have been fine.

639
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:44,462
Speaker 1: Right.

640
00:40:44,522 --> 00:40:49,640
Speaker 1: But the because there's plenty of room for people at the orchard and parking was the reason for the line.

641
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:56,020
Speaker 0: Even the orchard we ended up going to, we pull in and the parking guy like stand in there and he basically is like, yeah, you're fucked.

642
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,003
Speaker 0: There's nowhere to park.

643
00:40:57,044 --> 00:40:59,233
Speaker 0: You should just drive all the way in and turn around and get out.

644
00:40:59,595 --> 00:41:00,780
Speaker 0: And we did park and it was fine.

645
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,509
Speaker 0: The guy was just really harried.

646
00:41:02,569 --> 00:41:04,419
Speaker 0: And I think he was just trying to get people to turn around.

647
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:07,546
Speaker 1: I never saw somebody didn't want customers.

648
00:41:07,586 --> 00:41:07,726
Speaker 1: Right.

649
00:41:07,766 --> 00:41:12,460
Speaker 1: The other orchard with the mega line, you know, this orchard we went to didn't have a mega line.

650
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:12,641
Speaker 1: Nope.

651
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:13,947
Speaker 1: The one that did have the mega line.

652
00:41:13,987 --> 00:41:15,152
Speaker 1: They were turning people away.

653
00:41:15,192 --> 00:41:16,940
Speaker 1: They were like, yeah, keep this mega line going.

654
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:17,902
Speaker 1: Give me that money.

655
00:41:17,922 --> 00:41:18,785
Speaker 1: Let's go.

656
00:41:19,807 --> 00:41:24,280
Speaker 0: I just I don't believe most of the people in that line based on how long it looked like it was.

657
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:29,940
Speaker 0: And especially when I looked at Google and it showed a red line going off miles and miles and miles down that road.

658
00:41:31,301 --> 00:41:35,416
Speaker 0: I don't think most of those people could have even gotten into the orchard before it closed at five.

659
00:41:36,058 --> 00:41:36,500
Speaker 1: Who knows?

660
00:41:36,862 --> 00:41:37,726
Speaker 0: Because we we bailed.

661
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:38,389
Speaker 0: We're not stupid.

662
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:39,495
Speaker 0: We went to a different orchard.

663
00:41:39,676 --> 00:41:40,138
Speaker 0: Yeah.

664
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,670
Speaker 1: A further an orchard further away from the festival.

665
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:46,000
Speaker 1: Just like a restaurant further away from the convention.

666
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:46,461
Speaker 0: Yeah.

667
00:41:46,561 --> 00:41:47,003
Speaker 0: Has less.

668
00:41:47,424 --> 00:41:47,806
Speaker 0: Way less.

669
00:41:47,826 --> 00:41:51,480
Speaker 0: We basically just got right in even despite the dire warnings of the parking lot attendant.

670
00:41:51,901 --> 00:41:52,725
Speaker 0: We got right in.

671
00:41:53,127 --> 00:41:53,549
Speaker 1: We got it.

672
00:41:53,569 --> 00:41:55,639
Speaker 1: But it was a. it was a not as good orchard.

673
00:41:55,739 --> 00:41:55,920
Speaker 0: Yeah.

674
00:41:56,541 --> 00:42:00,977
Speaker 0: It seems like that orchards main deal was apple alcohol, which fine.

675
00:42:01,017 --> 00:42:01,780
Speaker 0: Like I'm here for that.

676
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:06,800
Speaker 1: I think if you were interested in alcohol that the orchard we went to would have been excellent, I assume.

677
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,284
Speaker 0: Except the problem is the poison.

678
00:42:08,385 --> 00:42:09,147
Speaker 0: I was driving us.

679
00:42:09,188 --> 00:42:11,556
Speaker 0: So it's not like I could partake of the alcohol.

680
00:42:11,576 --> 00:42:12,780
Speaker 1: You could have bought some to take home.

681
00:42:13,301 --> 00:42:15,949
Speaker 0: But I wouldn't want to hang out in the orchard and drink the alcohol.

682
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:19,760
Speaker 0: But also inside of this orchard, there weren't lines to do most things.

683
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,607
Speaker 0: And there wasn't even a big line for the donuts.

684
00:42:21,668 --> 00:42:22,069
Speaker 0: It's just they.

685
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:24,640
Speaker 0: they started selling the donuts at a specific time.

686
00:42:25,021 --> 00:42:27,326
Speaker 0: And Scott got into near the front of that line.

687
00:42:27,366 --> 00:42:28,128
Speaker 0: So we were good there.

688
00:42:28,669 --> 00:42:33,040
Speaker 0: The line to get the apple poison was so long that I basically couldn't.

689
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:33,561
Speaker 0: So I didn't.

690
00:42:33,601 --> 00:42:34,265
Speaker 0: I wouldn't bother.

691
00:42:34,325 --> 00:42:37,019
Speaker 1: Also, the donuts were not you know, they were fine, but they were not the best.

692
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:37,761
Speaker 0: Yeah.

693
00:42:37,801 --> 00:42:40,267
Speaker 0: I mean, even a bad cider donut is still good.

694
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:41,089
Speaker 0: And those were like.

695
00:42:41,129 --> 00:42:45,499
Speaker 0: those were, I'd say, B B level cider donuts, which is still great.

696
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:48,531
Speaker 0: Like I will eat twelve B level cedar donuts.

697
00:42:48,671 --> 00:42:49,916
Speaker 0: Cider donuts have no complaints.

698
00:42:50,619 --> 00:42:50,760
Speaker 1: Sure.

699
00:42:50,921 --> 00:42:55,740
Speaker 1: Now, there is also Fishkill Farms, which is in Fishkill, New York, up near where we used to live in Beacon.

700
00:42:56,161 --> 00:43:02,920
Speaker 1: And that farm, the way they solve their problem is they make you buy picking apple picking tickets in advance and they sell out.

701
00:43:03,241 --> 00:43:03,482
Speaker 1: Right.

702
00:43:03,884 --> 00:43:06,293
Speaker 1: So you could use some arbitrage and sell.

703
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:07,800
Speaker 1: you sell your apple picking tickets.

704
00:43:08,401 --> 00:43:20,920
Speaker 0: I think that is going to be more and more prevalent in the US in general, because something I've noticed post covid, things that used to be crowded, but not like terminally crowded are way more crowded lately.

705
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:26,020
Speaker 0: And I think it's partly people who were stuck inside for three years, kind of just going apeshit and doing stuff.

706
00:43:26,261 --> 00:43:29,272
Speaker 1: There are many there are many, many reasons for these sorts of things.

707
00:43:29,313 --> 00:43:31,220
Speaker 1: But anyway, the Apple Festival.

708
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:31,561
Speaker 0: Yes.

709
00:43:31,641 --> 00:43:40,620
Speaker 0: So the Apple Festival is about the scale of the equivalent non Apple Festival called Farm City Week that I used to go to every year as a kid in Michigan.

710
00:43:41,341 --> 00:43:44,075
Speaker 0: And I haven't been to a festival like that in a long time.

711
00:43:44,095 --> 00:43:45,100
Speaker 0: So I was kind of here for it.

712
00:43:45,841 --> 00:43:51,220
Speaker 1: It's like it's basically like the whole town is taken over by this Apple Festival.

713
00:43:51,480 --> 00:44:02,660
Speaker 1: Even businesses like that are not directly connected to the Apple Festival and are thus cut off from most of the foot traffic are still putting stuff out and setting up tents.

714
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:09,320
Speaker 0: And in every direction, like in the parking lot of the CVS, there was like a giant festival going on under a tent like.

715
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:09,881
Speaker 1: Right.

716
00:44:09,921 --> 00:44:16,200
Speaker 1: It's like it's like none of those things are on the official festival map or are part of the festival technically.

717
00:44:16,701 --> 00:44:23,420
Speaker 1: But like every single business that was within range of the festival was getting involved somehow.

718
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:28,840
Speaker 1: And it was effectively part of the festival because, you know, they got something going on.

719
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:29,402
Speaker 1: They're trying to.

720
00:44:29,422 --> 00:44:30,406
Speaker 1: you know, everyone's just.

721
00:44:30,727 --> 00:44:31,752
Speaker 1: it's like shit.

722
00:44:31,973 --> 00:44:33,640
Speaker 1: Tons of people are coming to our town.

723
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,620
Speaker 1: We're going to squeeze every last drop of money out of them that we can.

724
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,452
Speaker 0: So I wonder how many people attend this thing?

725
00:44:40,532 --> 00:44:41,236
Speaker 0: because a lot.

726
00:44:42,301 --> 00:44:42,804
Speaker 1: Yeah.

727
00:44:42,945 --> 00:44:43,789
Speaker 0: I wonder how many.

728
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:44,252
Speaker 0: Let's see.

729
00:44:44,372 --> 00:44:45,679
Speaker 0: Attendance at.

730
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,000
Speaker 1: It's going to be thousands, right?

731
00:44:48,763 --> 00:44:50,067
Speaker 0: I could guess 10,000.

732
00:44:50,067 --> 00:44:54,640
Speaker 0: A lot of people roll into a thing, leave, and New York City people are all coming.

733
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,887
Speaker 0: New York, Warwick, Apple Fest.

734
00:44:59,248 --> 00:45:00,170
Speaker 0: What is the estimate?

735
00:45:00,992 --> 00:45:03,198
Speaker 0: It's the largest Apple Festival.

736
00:45:03,258 --> 00:45:04,100
Speaker 0: They don't give me a number.

737
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,904
Speaker 0: It was a lot of people.

738
00:45:06,145 --> 00:45:08,776
Speaker 0: The population of this entire town is only 6,000 people.

739
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:10,782
Speaker 1: Yeah.

740
00:45:11,945 --> 00:45:16,480
Speaker 0: So I feel like a multiple of this town might have showed up for the day or at least for a portion of the festival.

741
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:27,260
Speaker 0: But, you know, in terms of the poisonous aspects of cars in America, there is no way to get to this town except by car.

742
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:36,920
Speaker 0: And there is not enough parking even for the people who live in this town, let alone thousands and thousands and thousands of New York City folk all driving up to go to this Apple Festival.

743
00:45:37,321 --> 00:45:45,680
Speaker 0: So they set up gigantic parking lots on the edge of town and a constant line of school buses taking people from their cars to the festival.

744
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:46,960
Speaker 1: Yep.

745
00:45:47,061 --> 00:45:48,266
Speaker 1: It's very intelligent of them.

746
00:45:48,286 --> 00:45:51,600
Speaker 1: It's like, well, you know, we need a parking lot, but we only need it once a year.

747
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:56,760
Speaker 1: And no one's going to school on fucking Saturday, even if school season has started.

748
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:00,880
Speaker 0: And the school, because everyone gets to the school and cars, has a massive parking lot.

749
00:46:01,521 --> 00:46:01,862
Speaker 1: Correct.

750
00:46:01,982 --> 00:46:07,340
Speaker 1: So it's like they just use the school's parking lot and they bus people to the festival and they charge ten bucks for it.

751
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,345
Speaker 1: And yeah, that's like.

752
00:46:09,445 --> 00:46:10,188
Speaker 1: that's just smart.

753
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:13,160
Speaker 1: I think that's actually something that bothers me a lot that I see.

754
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:23,980
Speaker 1: And even in New York City is that, for example, you have a school in New York City that has many facilities, lots of facilities that are all paid for and are run by the Department of Education.

755
00:46:24,622 --> 00:46:29,360
Speaker 1: But those are facilities even in the summer when they are not in use at all.

756
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:30,061
Speaker 1: Right.

757
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:33,220
Speaker 1: Or at night when they are not in use at all by any school.

758
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,183
Speaker 1: And there's no students.

759
00:46:34,223 --> 00:46:38,940
Speaker 1: there are basically off limits, even though they are public property.

760
00:46:39,541 --> 00:46:44,720
Speaker 1: No other members of the public can make any use of them because it's only for school.

761
00:46:45,281 --> 00:46:49,471
Speaker 1: And in the summer, you have like a huge field that's just empty and unused.

762
00:46:49,732 --> 00:46:52,900
Speaker 1: that could be like temporarily handed over to the Parks Department.

763
00:46:53,100 --> 00:47:04,680
Speaker 1: And then if somebody wanted to put the effort in, but in a small town, right, where there's less resources to manage and there aren't so many separate departments, right, managing everything.

764
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:12,860
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, we can just use our school building for fucking everything that we put a lot of the town's money into building this building.

765
00:47:12,981 --> 00:47:13,764
Speaker 0: Okay, I found a number.

766
00:47:13,784 --> 00:47:16,475
Speaker 0: The Warwick Applefest claims 30,000 people go on average.

767
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:18,086
Speaker 1: Not bad.

768
00:47:18,391 --> 00:47:18,736
Speaker 0: Not bad.

769
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:23,380
Speaker 0: So several, many times the population of the entire town.

770
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,925
Speaker 1: Yep.

771
00:47:26,085 --> 00:47:27,188
Speaker 1: So yeah, you go there.

772
00:47:27,509 --> 00:47:28,271
Speaker 1: And what do they have?

773
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:31,280
Speaker 1: Obviously, delicious foods of many, many varieties.

774
00:47:32,801 --> 00:47:33,945
Speaker 1: Even in New York City, right?

775
00:47:34,005 --> 00:47:38,520
Speaker 1: Obviously, if you take all the food of New York City, the Apple Festival can't compete.

776
00:47:38,881 --> 00:47:41,949
Speaker 1: But there is in New York City, the street fair.

777
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:46,080
Speaker 1: There is a street fair that basically is always in existence.

778
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,847
Speaker 1: It just moves constantly.

779
00:47:47,867 --> 00:47:50,480
Speaker 1: And it has mostly the robot carnival.

780
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:54,066
Speaker 1: Yeah, it has mostly the same vendors, but not always.

781
00:47:54,186 --> 00:48:01,260
Speaker 1: But it mostly they basically every different weekend day holiday, you could just there's a website that tells you exactly where it's going to be.

782
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:06,880
Speaker 1: But even if you don't check that website, if you just bike around New York City, you're likely to run into it.

783
00:48:07,143 --> 00:48:08,020
Speaker 1: If it's not a weekday.

784
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:12,440
Speaker 0: Every now and then it's near my office and I walk outside and I bump into it and guess where I eat lunch?

785
00:48:13,221 --> 00:48:14,907
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's in my neighborhood frequently.

786
00:48:14,987 --> 00:48:18,620
Speaker 1: But the food, it has, you know, carny festival food.

787
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:24,640
Speaker 1: The Warwick Apple Festival food is better than the New York every weekend street fair food.

788
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:25,799
Speaker 0: Absolutely better.

789
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:26,857
Speaker 1: By a lot.

790
00:48:28,001 --> 00:48:34,100
Speaker 0: In fact, my only regret is that I did not eat more of the food, but I am 41 years old and my stomach can only hold so much food.

791
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:39,060
Speaker 1: The problem is it's like I really, really want to try all the different foods at the at the festival.

792
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:47,340
Speaker 1: But unlike, say, the the night market in the night market, it's like everyone's making small dishes for like five bucks each.

793
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:52,220
Speaker 1: You can get a lot of them and you can share them if you go to the Apple Festival and you don't have a lot of people with you.

794
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:57,072
Speaker 1: It's like you get one thing from one cart and it's like more.

795
00:48:57,172 --> 00:49:00,400
Speaker 1: it's like ten bucks or more and they give you a pile of food.

796
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:09,480
Speaker 0: And it's like, I guess the amount of Polish food they handed me when I ordered one plate of Polish food that is intended for one person was that was three people of food.

797
00:49:10,103 --> 00:49:11,579
Speaker 1: That was two and a half at least.

798
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,579
Speaker 0: That was that was a terrifying amount of food.

799
00:49:15,381 --> 00:49:18,593
Speaker 1: It's like, don't you want me to like, you know, give more money?

800
00:49:18,954 --> 00:49:20,480
Speaker 1: It's like you should be giving out less food.

801
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:25,760
Speaker 0: If you had given me a third of the food on that plate, it's still for the same price, for the same price.

802
00:49:25,841 --> 00:49:26,839
Speaker 0: And I would not have complained.

803
00:49:27,624 --> 00:49:30,640
Speaker 1: And you would have gone to some other booth and also patronize them as well.

804
00:49:32,421 --> 00:49:34,865
Speaker 1: Anyway, so, yeah, lots of delicious foods.

805
00:49:34,925 --> 00:49:43,000
Speaker 1: You can get doughnuts, you can get pies, you can get apple poison, you can get cookies, you can get Polish food and your barbecue and fucking everything.

806
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:50,880
Speaker 0: There's also a lot of quaint small town charm vending, but it seems to be almost exclusively.

807
00:49:52,762 --> 00:49:56,620
Speaker 0: I'm going to say I don't mean this uncharitably low tier arts and crafts.

808
00:49:57,365 --> 00:49:58,240
Speaker 1: Yes, that's what it is.

809
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,480
Speaker 0: Or candles.

810
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:00,800
Speaker 1: Yep.

811
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:12,897
Speaker 1: Well, anytime you go to any craft fair, including the Every Weekend New York Street Fair, any kind of fair, the things you will always see a lot of are people who make candles, soap, jewelry.

812
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:17,531
Speaker 1: Those are the big pottery.

813
00:50:17,612 --> 00:50:18,459
Speaker 1: Those are the big four.

814
00:50:18,681 --> 00:50:21,820
Speaker 0: Now the pottery was some of the better pottery I've seen at a festival like this.

815
00:50:21,901 --> 00:50:22,062
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

816
00:50:22,082 --> 00:50:24,620
Speaker 1: The quality of those varies wildly.

817
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:28,629
Speaker 1: But like those are the four things you're going to see the most frequently.

818
00:50:28,649 --> 00:50:33,480
Speaker 1: There's like the most, you know, small time, you know, independent little crafty people.

819
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,206
Speaker 0: How many candles can people burn?

820
00:50:35,386 --> 00:50:39,400
Speaker 0: If I have a bar of soap, it lasts like two or three months.

821
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,286
Speaker 1: People like, you know, I think.

822
00:50:42,306 --> 00:50:45,558
Speaker 1: the other thing is you got to think people have like big houses, right?

823
00:50:45,598 --> 00:50:46,060
Speaker 1: Not like us.

824
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:47,799
Speaker 0: I only have a closet full of soap.

825
00:50:48,322 --> 00:50:50,391
Speaker 1: Well, if they got a lot of bathrooms, right?

826
00:50:50,432 --> 00:50:52,300
Speaker 1: You ever go into like some suburban house?

827
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,279
Speaker 0: Oh, and they got the bad, the unused bathroom.

828
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,360
Speaker 1: There's like some bathroom that like is not used too often.

829
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:03,660
Speaker 1: And you go in there because you're a guest and it's a convenient spot and you go in there and they always have a weird soap in there.

830
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,840
Speaker 1: It's like, should I use this soap or is it a decorative soap?

831
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:14,335
Speaker 0: My aunt literally like got mad at us when I was a kid once because we use the like the bathroom that nobody uses.

832
00:51:14,355 --> 00:51:16,840
Speaker 0: that had the fancy towels and the fancy soap in it.

833
00:51:17,302 --> 00:51:20,040
Speaker 0: And we use the soap that was supposed to be decorative.

834
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:29,300
Speaker 0: That was a long time ago, but the candles too, like it takes a long time to burn a candle down and nothing.

835
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:33,700
Speaker 0: And yet candles seem to be the hottest commodity at this festival.

836
00:51:34,203 --> 00:51:36,020
Speaker 1: Well, I think people love to make candles.

837
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:45,220
Speaker 1: And also, you know, you can make a candle even if you are just making candles, you can come up with like a smell that isn't exactly like anyone else's candle.

838
00:51:45,422 --> 00:51:45,644
Speaker 1: Right.

839
00:51:45,664 --> 00:51:47,239
Speaker 1: Because there's so much variety you can do.

840
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:57,460
Speaker 1: So even if you're small time in the candle game, you can get, you know, you might be able to make a sale if someone comes along and they're like, wow, I never seen, you know, that particular smell.

841
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:05,900
Speaker 0: Plus, it's way easy to make soy candles in the year 2023, like without a lot of skills and equipment compared to more traditional kinds of candles.

842
00:52:06,321 --> 00:52:10,011
Speaker 0: And what I did not see were any traditional candles.

843
00:52:10,152 --> 00:52:13,120
Speaker 0: It was only like modern, quick to make soy candles.

844
00:52:14,101 --> 00:52:14,301
Speaker 1: Yep.

845
00:52:14,863 --> 00:52:20,960
Speaker 1: And the other thing is that there are people out there who literally are burning at least one candle just fucking all the time.

846
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:21,926
Speaker 0: That is true.

847
00:52:22,007 --> 00:52:23,099
Speaker 0: That is not me.

848
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,760
Speaker 0: But I know you're out there.

849
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:27,460
Speaker 1: There are candle people out there who just have a candle going always.

850
00:52:28,141 --> 00:52:28,542
Speaker 1: Yep.

851
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:34,336
Speaker 0: I like a candle occasionally, but also if a candle's burning, I got to turn off all the air filters because all the air filters are like, what the fuck?

852
00:52:34,376 --> 00:52:35,258
Speaker 0: Everyone's going to die.

853
00:52:35,278 --> 00:52:36,020
Speaker 0: Nine, nine, nine.

854
00:52:37,061 --> 00:52:37,202
Speaker 1: Yeah.

855
00:52:37,242 --> 00:52:40,238
Speaker 1: I mean, maybe burning a candle all the time isn't that good for you.

856
00:52:40,258 --> 00:52:40,560
Speaker 0: Who knows?

857
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:41,340
Speaker 0: Probably not.

858
00:52:44,041 --> 00:52:46,808
Speaker 1: Anyway, but yeah, you know, it's one of those things where it's like.

859
00:52:46,848 --> 00:52:51,200
Speaker 1: I look at all these crafts and some of them are meh and some of them it's like, ooh, look at that.

860
00:52:51,541 --> 00:52:54,020
Speaker 1: But I end up not buying basically anything.

861
00:52:54,661 --> 00:52:54,721
Speaker 0: Yep.

862
00:52:54,741 --> 00:52:56,346
Speaker 0: You know what, though, is I actually?

863
00:52:56,366 --> 00:53:01,000
Speaker 0: it's about the same thing that I do in artist alleys and conventions.

864
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:06,040
Speaker 0: The odds of me buying something at an artist alley in a convention are effectively zero.

865
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:10,320
Speaker 0: Like you're going to see me buy a lottery ticket more often than I buy anything at an artist alley.

866
00:53:10,701 --> 00:53:13,129
Speaker 0: But I really like to look around an artist alley.

867
00:53:13,209 --> 00:53:16,018
Speaker 0: I'll spend all day looking at every single booth to see what their deal is.

868
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,522
Speaker 0: And that's the same thing.

869
00:53:18,642 --> 00:53:20,506
Speaker 0: I like a good time to walk around.

870
00:53:20,546 --> 00:53:28,540
Speaker 0: I'm not too jaded as a fancy pants rich New York podcast dude to head upstate and go to a quaint town festival and mooch around for a few hours.

871
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,622
Speaker 1: So there's two other things about the festival.

872
00:53:30,723 --> 00:53:45,480
Speaker 1: One of them is that since it sort of sprawls over the whole town and not just this main area, there's one like road that is basically they remove the cars from the road because it connects like the main festival area from the town park, which has like a pond.

873
00:53:46,102 --> 00:53:48,247
Speaker 1: And so they are a road that connects them.

874
00:53:48,488 --> 00:53:52,960
Speaker 1: They basically block that road so that people can walk between the two locations.

875
00:53:53,841 --> 00:53:59,671
Speaker 1: And everyone who lives along that road is setting up booths and shit.

876
00:54:00,091 --> 00:54:05,020
Speaker 1: Even people who just live there are putting like that's the day they come out with their tag sale trying to sell their shit.

877
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:05,340
Speaker 1: Right.

878
00:54:05,421 --> 00:54:11,711
Speaker 1: It's like everyone is getting in on, you know, the church is on that road or like getting in on it, setting up booths.

879
00:54:12,152 --> 00:54:12,412
Speaker 1: Right.

880
00:54:12,572 --> 00:54:17,020
Speaker 1: It's like they're all like, whoo, people are foot traffic is going to be here today.

881
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:21,167
Speaker 1: Therefore, this residential road is now a commercial road.

882
00:54:21,187 --> 00:54:21,648
Speaker 1: Let's go.

883
00:54:21,668 --> 00:54:26,779
Speaker 0: The thing is, imagine how cool that town would be if that road just didn't have cars on it.

884
00:54:27,741 --> 00:54:31,727
Speaker 1: Well, I'm just saying, but it's like, I'm just, it's really cool to like, sort of like.

885
00:54:31,767 --> 00:54:35,232
Speaker 1: imagine if everyone in the street you live on one day, just.

886
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:40,240
Speaker 1: everyone goes up and sets a booth up outside their house and you have like a, you know, not just a block party.

887
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:43,526
Speaker 0: So that actually used to happen when I was a kid, you know, I lived in Detroit.

888
00:54:44,067 --> 00:54:50,440
Speaker 0: So we had a neighborhood tag sale day where everyone did their garage sales on the same day.

889
00:54:50,560 --> 00:55:03,578
Speaker 0: So it became like, but we also had a couple, every year we had one or two, uh, basically like block parties where every house put a booth with something going on in front of their house.

890
00:55:03,658 --> 00:55:05,360
Speaker 0: Like some houses did an arts and crafts thing.

891
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,663
Speaker 0: Some houses would do like a haunted house thing.

892
00:55:07,984 --> 00:55:09,827
Speaker 0: Some houses would just have food that was free.

893
00:55:10,107 --> 00:55:11,469
Speaker 0: Some houses would do a garage sale.

894
00:55:11,509 --> 00:55:17,840
Speaker 0: Some people would sell stuff, but every house like did a thing on this day for this like local block party festival.

895
00:55:19,561 --> 00:55:23,273
Speaker 1: And the last thing I want to say, which will probably make someone mad at me, but whatever.

896
00:55:23,494 --> 00:55:25,480
Speaker 1: It's just the truth that I can't deny.

897
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:26,871
Speaker 0: I can't wait to hear what you have to say.

898
00:55:26,891 --> 00:55:27,639
Speaker 0: Cause I actually don't know.

899
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:32,206
Speaker 1: So the Apple festival has many live musical performances, which is great.

900
00:55:32,306 --> 00:55:33,007
Speaker 1: That's terrific.

901
00:55:33,067 --> 00:55:33,207
Speaker 1: Right?

902
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:35,110
Speaker 1: They were like, there's way more than you think.

903
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:36,592
Speaker 1: Like the park has one.

904
00:55:36,873 --> 00:55:41,500
Speaker 1: Then the church has gone as like, it's like a random fiddling guy on the main street.

905
00:55:41,942 --> 00:55:44,680
Speaker 1: And then there's a, I think a Z-Boat is another performance.

906
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,605
Speaker 0: The fiddling guy was better than the average fiddler I hear in New York.

907
00:55:48,486 --> 00:55:48,887
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

908
00:55:49,588 --> 00:55:50,369
Speaker 1: It could actually fiddle.

909
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:52,112
Speaker 1: People were jigging, doing a jig.

910
00:55:52,393 --> 00:55:53,975
Speaker 0: I jigged a little walking past him.

911
00:55:54,016 --> 00:55:54,637
Speaker 0: I could not help.

912
00:55:54,717 --> 00:55:55,718
Speaker 0: It was, it was too powerful.

913
00:55:55,758 --> 00:55:56,139
Speaker 0: The jig.

914
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:56,640
Speaker 0: Yeah.

915
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:02,110
Speaker 1: They had a person on a horse and a headless horseman costume you could photo with.

916
00:56:02,631 --> 00:56:04,796
Speaker 0: An S-tier beautiful horse too.

917
00:56:04,856 --> 00:56:06,840
Speaker 0: Like this was a particularly good looking horse.

918
00:56:07,341 --> 00:56:07,541
Speaker 1: Yeah.

919
00:56:07,581 --> 00:56:10,225
Speaker 1: There was a rock band that was in the park by the pond.

920
00:56:10,285 --> 00:56:11,426
Speaker 1: That was pretty good actually.

921
00:56:11,446 --> 00:56:20,920
Speaker 1: Um, you know, I didn't listen to every performance and hang around all day, but one, the one, when we got, we first arrived and we got off the school bus after the parking lot.

922
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:28,511
Speaker 1: There were clearly people who were either community theater or high school theater drama club people singing show tunes.

923
00:56:28,811 --> 00:56:29,012
Speaker 1: Right?

924
00:56:29,312 --> 00:56:31,856
Speaker 1: Now they were quite good singers, right?

925
00:56:31,876 --> 00:56:34,680
Speaker 1: They could sing about 10,000 times better than I can.

926
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,622
Speaker 0: About 20,000 times better than I can.

927
00:56:36,642 --> 00:56:37,523
Speaker 0: Yeah.

928
00:56:37,583 --> 00:56:37,763
Speaker 1: Right.

929
00:56:37,783 --> 00:56:41,407
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, they were, and they, they were singing the show tunes properly.

930
00:56:41,547 --> 00:56:45,731
Speaker 1: They had talents and skills and their performance was enjoyable.

931
00:56:46,592 --> 00:56:48,914
Speaker 1: And, uh, I was not upset that they were there.

932
00:56:48,954 --> 00:56:53,018
Speaker 1: We, we, we ate the Polish food in, in their vicinity to hear them.

933
00:56:53,779 --> 00:56:54,740
Speaker 1: Uh, it was very nice.

934
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:58,984
Speaker 0: However, we live in New York, however, I live in New York.

935
00:56:59,044 --> 00:56:59,264
Speaker 1: Right.

936
00:56:59,344 --> 00:57:07,391
Speaker 1: And I realized it made me realize it was like riding the small roller coaster after riding only the big roller coaster.

937
00:57:07,551 --> 00:57:07,732
Speaker 1: Right.

938
00:57:08,212 --> 00:57:16,399
Speaker 1: I, I had become spoiled and taken for granted that like the only shows I've been to in recent years are.

939
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:21,204
Speaker 1: Metropolitan opera, actual Broadway theater, right?

940
00:57:21,444 --> 00:57:23,566
Speaker 1: Radio city music, right?

941
00:57:23,786 --> 00:57:27,970
Speaker 1: It's like touring bands that are huge jazz band.

942
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:29,652
Speaker 0: We see it at Lincoln center.

943
00:57:30,453 --> 00:57:30,693
Speaker 1: Right.

944
00:57:30,753 --> 00:57:38,020
Speaker 1: It's like, I've been spoiled living in New York city, basically only feasting on the foie gras of music.

945
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:45,965
Speaker 0: When I ever talk about Cedar point, cause once you've been there, like no other roller coaster is even like it's there.

946
00:57:46,365 --> 00:57:51,769
Speaker 0: They're fine roller coasters, but they're beneath the scale of notice to someone who has even been to Cedar point.

947
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:52,410
Speaker 1: Right.

948
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:53,791
Speaker 1: But it's like, I had forgotten.

949
00:57:54,211 --> 00:57:54,431
Speaker 1: Right.

950
00:57:54,491 --> 00:57:55,052
Speaker 1: The difference.

951
00:57:55,332 --> 00:57:55,592
Speaker 1: Right.

952
00:57:55,832 --> 00:58:06,040
Speaker 1: And so it, it, it provided this stark reminder that like, yeah, you know, you went to the opera and it sounded like someone was playing a CD, but even better somehow.

953
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:10,846
Speaker 1: And it's like, you know, whereas this had a little bit of that karaoke sound in it.

954
00:58:11,026 --> 00:58:11,286
Speaker 1: Right.

955
00:58:11,466 --> 00:58:12,487
Speaker 1: That wasn't so great.

956
00:58:12,648 --> 00:58:23,080
Speaker 1: And it's like, you know, it didn't ruin it, but it's just like, you could tell the difference right between the S tier that you had and the maybe a or B plus tier that you're having now.

957
00:58:23,721 --> 00:58:25,704
Speaker 1: And it reminded me, Oh, right.

958
00:58:25,864 --> 00:58:32,655
Speaker 1: I am very privileged to live in New York city and enjoy the finest that the world has to offer.

959
00:58:33,116 --> 00:58:34,719
Speaker 1: You know, there, there is a difference.

960
00:58:34,819 --> 00:58:35,460
Speaker 1: It's not the same.

961
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:36,000
Speaker 1: Yeah.

962
00:58:36,921 --> 00:58:48,971
Speaker 0: And I can, we can enjoy that finest writing a few stops on a subway two hours north, but it was valuable because in fact I'm going to the opera a week from Saturday.

963
00:58:49,171 --> 00:58:49,691
Speaker 1: Right.

964
00:58:49,791 --> 00:58:52,394
Speaker 1: And so I will not take for granted.

965
00:58:52,414 --> 00:58:53,154
Speaker 1: Right.

966
00:58:53,935 --> 00:59:00,320
Speaker 1: Uh, you know, the difference between rubbing, I guess, honey on my ears and just raw sugar.

967
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:07,006
Speaker 0: But, uh, yeah, I'd say the Warwick Apple Fest is a perfectly fine, fun town festival.

968
00:59:07,146 --> 00:59:10,170
Speaker 0: I'd like, I, I like town festivals.

969
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:11,211
Speaker 0: I like that kind of thing.

970
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:11,912
Speaker 0: I like that five.

971
00:59:11,972 --> 00:59:16,838
Speaker 0: I like seeing a community of people like putting on a thing and being proud of it.

972
00:59:16,978 --> 00:59:18,620
Speaker 0: Like I just, I enjoy everything about that.

973
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:25,934
Speaker 0: My only worry is that it's going to only get more crowded because Warwick can't get bigger yet.

974
00:59:26,035 --> 00:59:28,500
Speaker 0: New York city's influence grows evermore.

975
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:33,566
Speaker 1: I mean they could block off more of their roads and expand, right?

976
00:59:33,646 --> 00:59:34,507
Speaker 1: The festival that way.

977
00:59:34,808 --> 00:59:35,729
Speaker 1: Um, so yeah.

978
00:59:35,829 --> 00:59:37,832
Speaker 1: Would I go back to the Warwick Apple Festival?

979
00:59:37,892 --> 00:59:38,172
Speaker 1: Yes.

980
00:59:38,232 --> 00:59:40,075
Speaker 1: Would I go every year and like make a point of it?

981
00:59:40,175 --> 00:59:40,496
Speaker 1: No.

982
00:59:40,956 --> 00:59:41,217
Speaker 1: Right.

983
00:59:41,357 --> 00:59:43,620
Speaker 1: It's kind of a hassle to get out there.

984
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:48,025
Speaker 0: I want to try to like bring all our people and like, yeah,

985
00:59:48,566 --> 00:59:59,700
Speaker 1: I think what I'm going to do next year is I'm going to go back to the, the Fishkill Orchard, um, you know, which where you make the, where you make an appointment because they have the, the top tier donut.

986
01:00:01,201 --> 01:00:04,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could use an, I like the donuts we got, but I could use an S tier donut.

987
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:12,856
