1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,519
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, June 7th 2018.

2
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,342
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,422 --> 00:00:15,010
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,551 --> 00:00:16,955
Speaker 0: Indian food cuz.

5
00:00:16,995 --> 00:00:18,599
Speaker 0: we really are out of Thursday.

6
00:00:18,639 --> 00:00:19,321
Speaker 0: show ideas.

7
00:00:19,962 --> 00:00:21,867
Speaker 1: This is my microphone working complaining.

8
00:00:21,887 --> 00:00:22,870
Speaker 0: Your microphone is working.

9
00:00:24,452 --> 00:00:25,488
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

10
00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:29,950
Speaker 1: So at work, I got this new job in a new neighborhood.

11
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,399
Speaker 1: It's actually old neighborhood is the same neighborhood.

12
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,909
Speaker 1: my previous job, you know, it's crazy ten years ago was in.

13
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,475
Speaker 0: I'm in the exact same boat.

14
00:00:36,576 --> 00:00:45,043
Speaker 0: I recently got a new job and I'm in the neighborhood where my job from ten years ago was anyway, so The problem is is food situation down there.

15
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:49,742
Speaker 1: There's plenty of places to get food But a lot of them are very expensive.

16
00:00:49,762 --> 00:00:50,646
Speaker 1: There are some cheap ones.

17
00:00:50,807 --> 00:00:51,590
Speaker 0: Oh cry me a river.

18
00:00:51,731 --> 00:00:56,770
Speaker 0: I'm in Midtown next to Grand Central All right, but it's either pret or a twelve dollar sand.

19
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:03,506
Speaker 1: But the thing is even at least in Midtown I could go to the everything deli and there were some everything delis there that were good.

20
00:01:03,606 --> 00:01:06,804
Speaker 1: down in Soho There's like one everything deli and it's gross.

21
00:01:07,307 --> 00:01:10,770
Speaker 1: Yeah And basically all the good food is fancy.

22
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,799
Speaker 1: There's a. there's some food that is cheap and not fancy.

23
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:17,070
Speaker 1: go to Chinatown or I can go to like the bond me place.

24
00:01:17,793 --> 00:01:18,657
Speaker 1: That's about it though.

25
00:01:18,697 --> 00:01:22,497
Speaker 1: So it's like if you eat the cheap food, you're gonna be eating the same food every day Which is no good.

26
00:01:22,698 --> 00:01:24,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I try to find a different solution.

27
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:36,338
Speaker 1: My previous solution used to be to bring bread peanut butter and jelly to work and make sandwiches and you know Keep it cheap, but I really don't want to eat peanut butter and jelly every day Anymore like I used to.

28
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:37,062
Speaker 0: well, I made it.

29
00:01:37,143 --> 00:01:40,330
Speaker 0: I made a conscious decision In fact, we thought about doing this show on lunch.

30
00:01:40,631 --> 00:01:45,950
Speaker 0: We looked up and sure enough we did a show on lunch and I said something in that show and I'll say it again now Is this relevant?

31
00:01:46,451 --> 00:01:58,834
Speaker 0: I made the decision a long time ago even when I didn't have a lot of money that I was willing to pay What it cost to have a good hot lunch every goddamn day that I do not have to make myself And I consider that a cost of.

32
00:01:59,055 --> 00:02:01,241
Speaker 1: it's weird how near Times Square there were.

33
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:05,484
Speaker 1: I could save like it was multiple dollars per day Cheaper than where I am now.

34
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:06,010
Speaker 1: But anyway.

35
00:02:07,652 --> 00:02:12,779
Speaker 1: So for once, you know, I made a some dinner I cook some dinner and I actually brought the leftovers to work.

36
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:15,890
Speaker 1: and I was like I finally brought the leftovers to work.

37
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,970
Speaker 1: Go me I did it and I'm gonna pay zero dollars effectively for lunch today.

38
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,590
Speaker 0: My co-workers are all on a kick with that lately.

39
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,001
Speaker 0: Everyone's like who did you bring today?

40
00:02:23,022 --> 00:02:23,667
Speaker 0: or did you bail?

41
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,255
Speaker 1: That's what everyone and my you know, a lot of people in my work They bring.

42
00:02:27,275 --> 00:02:32,146
Speaker 1: the fridge is like totally full But it's like I have to actually cook and remember to do it that one person brings.

43
00:02:32,226 --> 00:02:34,377
Speaker 0: everyone else gets impressed Like whoa, you actually did it.

44
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:35,644
Speaker 0: No, I should do it too.

45
00:02:35,724 --> 00:02:36,629
Speaker 1: Almost everyone does it.

46
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:43,250
Speaker 1: But the thing is I go out and like sit down at a restaurant the day that I brought in my leftovers to eat.

47
00:02:43,952 --> 00:02:47,942
Speaker 1: The microwave at work is broken and it won't be fixed till like tomorrow.

48
00:02:48,263 --> 00:02:49,426
Speaker 1: Ah, so I brought sucks.

49
00:02:49,607 --> 00:02:54,675
Speaker 1: So I brought the leftovers home During your fridge.

50
00:02:54,735 --> 00:02:58,310
Speaker 1: now, I'll either microwave them and leave or go home then microwave.

51
00:02:58,552 --> 00:03:07,810
Speaker 0: See when I would bring lunches Like the few times I would do that I would never rely on a microwave at the remote destination partly because I don't like reheating things with microwaves.

52
00:03:08,252 --> 00:03:09,115
Speaker 0: They tend not to.

53
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:09,778
Speaker 1: how can you?

54
00:03:09,798 --> 00:03:12,530
Speaker 1: but there are certain things that I mean, it's like yes, it's true.

55
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:18,315
Speaker 1: If I'm gonna reheat say, I don't know Like a Sandwich.

56
00:03:18,496 --> 00:03:20,569
Speaker 0: I worked in a place once that had a fucking stove.

57
00:03:21,072 --> 00:03:22,258
Speaker 1: I mean we have a toaster oven.

58
00:03:22,278 --> 00:03:24,690
Speaker 1: I can reheat things in but it's like I'm gonna reheat a sandwich.

59
00:03:24,811 --> 00:03:25,801
Speaker 1: I'll do that in a toaster oven.

60
00:03:25,821 --> 00:03:31,608
Speaker 1: so it's nice and crispy Right, but if I'm gonna reheat a bowl of pastas, I'm not gonna do that in a toaster oven.

61
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,090
Speaker 1: that doesn't work.

62
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:32,735
Speaker 1: It dries out.

63
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:33,844
Speaker 1: You got to do it in the microwave.

64
00:03:33,925 --> 00:03:34,550
Speaker 1: That's a microwave.

65
00:03:34,731 --> 00:03:36,898
Speaker 1: Anything mushy is a microwave reheating.

66
00:03:36,938 --> 00:03:40,430
Speaker 0: see I would only ever bring lunches that were things that didn't require reheating.

67
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:42,961
Speaker 1: I cooked a pasta for dinner and now it's still.

68
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:45,030
Speaker 1: it's not gonna magically change into a sandwich.

69
00:03:45,211 --> 00:03:46,850
Speaker 1: It needs to be reheated in the microwave.

70
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:53,264
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know I just I. it was partly when I was working at a hospital.

71
00:03:53,284 --> 00:03:54,067
Speaker 0: I was in Yonkers.

72
00:03:54,408 --> 00:03:54,789
Speaker 0: there were.

73
00:03:55,773 --> 00:04:01,350
Speaker 0: Well when I say were there was one place you could get lunch without driving somewhere.

74
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:06,750
Speaker 0: Oh boy, so I would walk 20 minutes to that one place and you know what it was.

75
00:04:07,191 --> 00:04:13,450
Speaker 0: It was a sit-down Italian restaurant nice, but because it was in Yonkers, it was actually really cheap.

76
00:04:13,773 --> 00:04:22,070
Speaker 0: so every day for lunch I'd have like spaghetti or like a lasagna like real Italian food for like six bucks.

77
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,480
Speaker 1: I'm used to when in Midtown the lunches were usually like $8.

78
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:33,684
Speaker 1: He'd end up spending $10 maybe for lunch down in Soho It's like $15 and $3 a day adds up real fast.

79
00:04:33,704 --> 00:04:38,141
Speaker 0: If I just go to the Pret in Midtown It's like nine bucks for a mediocre sandwich.

80
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:39,025
Speaker 1: That's not enough food.

81
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,934
Speaker 1: The other thing is like a lot of times It's not enough foods.

82
00:04:41,075 --> 00:04:43,490
Speaker 1: No, and I'm still hungry and it's just like that's not good.

83
00:04:43,772 --> 00:04:52,870
Speaker 0: The only thing that saves me is that there's an unlimited Pantry in my job so I can basically get free breakfast and constant snacks like bananas and stuff.

84
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:53,854
Speaker 1: It's like I've been.

85
00:04:53,974 --> 00:04:55,581
Speaker 1: you know where I was in Midtown.

86
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:57,690
Speaker 1: I can go to the food emporium, which is an overpriced supermarket.

87
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,684
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you think oh, that's an overpriced supermarket.

88
00:05:00,744 --> 00:05:01,227
Speaker 1: Guess what?

89
00:05:01,307 --> 00:05:05,813
Speaker 1: down in Soho It's a Dean and DeLuca, which is a one-percenter Supermarket.

90
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:09,350
Speaker 0: where I do an apple is $10 a little bit even though the commute was longer.

91
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,141
Speaker 0: I miss working downtown because I could get it like go-go curry.

92
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:15,716
Speaker 0: That is plenty of food for like $6.

93
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:15,979
Speaker 0: that's what.

94
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:20,130
Speaker 1: that's the kind of places I'm need for my lunch if I had enough of those places that I didn't have to eat.

95
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:23,425
Speaker 0: I mean, I know the problem was I went to go-go curry like twice a week.

96
00:05:23,626 --> 00:05:24,269
Speaker 0: That's bad news.

97
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:26,559
Speaker 0: That's bad news for a lot of reasons.

98
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,287
Speaker 1: That sounds like good news to me.

99
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:28,790
Speaker 1: It's good.

100
00:05:29,011 --> 00:05:30,638
Speaker 0: Well, you know what it is like all things.

101
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,170
Speaker 0: It's good news until it's bad news.

102
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,639
Speaker 1: It sounds like it's just good news.

103
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:40,710
Speaker 0: in the immortal words of Dave Riley The best thing in life is pooping and the worst thing in life is too much pooping.

104
00:05:40,871 --> 00:05:43,018
Speaker 1: I think to go curries a week will not be too much.

105
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,848
Speaker 0: Yeah, the problem is I wanted to go that third time.

106
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:49,189
Speaker 1: No I'd be holding back at the second time.

107
00:05:51,193 --> 00:05:52,609
Speaker 0: So there's a bunch of news going on.

108
00:05:52,710 --> 00:06:03,130
Speaker 0: But I do have an opening bit too because you might have noticed We didn't live stream some of our shows recently and then we started up again and the one Live stream we did earlier in this week Scott was really quiet.

109
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:16,504
Speaker 0: so the deal is we've had a lot of Hardware issues in the geek nights pipeline lately because the mixer we use is Hella decommissioned like it is to even down mission.

110
00:06:16,524 --> 00:06:17,830
Speaker 1: Do you know what decommission means?

111
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,639
Speaker 1: So do you mean deprecated or discontinued?

112
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,266
Speaker 0: So it's not just so.

113
00:06:22,306 --> 00:06:23,310
Speaker 0: it's not just discontinued.

114
00:06:23,892 --> 00:06:26,440
Speaker 0: It is discontinued to the point that I can't even get support.

115
00:06:26,882 --> 00:06:27,022
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

116
00:06:27,243 --> 00:06:29,149
Speaker 0: It's actually hard to download the drivers.

117
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:30,434
Speaker 0: There's like.

118
00:06:30,795 --> 00:06:32,841
Speaker 1: I even try to download them and back them up on your neck.

119
00:06:32,922 --> 00:06:33,744
Speaker 0: I did download.

120
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:35,470
Speaker 0: I have them backed up on the NAS.

121
00:06:37,072 --> 00:06:43,327
Speaker 0: It is to the point where hardware failures like I even contacted third-party people like yo, well, that might be a problem.

122
00:06:43,368 --> 00:06:46,865
Speaker 1: if you know Windows 11 comes out and the drivers don't work.

123
00:06:46,885 --> 00:06:52,805
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm already at the point where I have an extra firewire card that I know works with this thing.

124
00:06:52,825 --> 00:06:55,990
Speaker 0: in case the card I use doesn't work anymore.

125
00:06:56,751 --> 00:07:00,426
Speaker 1: So you might need to keep like a computer around but the old software on it.

126
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:01,612
Speaker 1: in case you know I'm.

127
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,186
Speaker 0: uh, well the software is audition.

128
00:07:03,226 --> 00:07:12,130
Speaker 1: luckily I'm saying like, you know, if you say one day Windows 11 now You might want to like grab a laptop that has a fire, you know, an old laptop with a firewire.

129
00:07:12,351 --> 00:07:14,098
Speaker 1: My hope runs Windows 10.

130
00:07:14,098 --> 00:07:33,394
Speaker 0: My only hope is that the audio hardware industry Joins the modern world before this mixer dies because I do not want to buy another mixer because I love the hell out of this thing and It's shocking how shitty most of the even professional Audio equipment out there is.

131
00:07:33,775 --> 00:07:39,810
Speaker 0: if you want a digital mixer and you're not willing to spend like eight to ten thousand dollars.

132
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:46,964
Speaker 1: Yeah, I looked and I saw tons of new mixers that lots of fancy features that could be good For example, then you die integrate with apps.

133
00:07:47,004 --> 00:07:48,070
Speaker 1: They have touch screens.

134
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,923
Speaker 1: They don't have too many software instead of having hardware control.

135
00:07:51,943 --> 00:08:05,976
Speaker 0: They say things like yeah 24 channels but no, it's 24x2 channels or sometimes it's 24 analog channels 2x2 digital right and it'll be like when you plug in the USB 3 cable There's only two channels.

136
00:08:06,157 --> 00:08:10,335
Speaker 1: Ah, it's just a stereo sound card Whereas this a real digital mixer.

137
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:15,430
Speaker 1: in audition will actually every single channel on the mixer will be a different line in audition.

138
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:15,712
Speaker 1: That's the.

139
00:08:16,033 --> 00:08:17,522
Speaker 1: that's literally the only feature we need.

140
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:18,790
Speaker 1: We don't need all these other features.

141
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:28,675
Speaker 1: They've crammed in there like effects and shit because our podcasting Want is that there should be at least like four to eight channels in audition All separately up.

142
00:08:29,238 --> 00:08:29,580
Speaker 1: That's it.

143
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,304
Speaker 1: That's all we need.

144
00:08:30,586 --> 00:08:31,310
Speaker 0: I use more than that.

145
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:41,190
Speaker 0: so the other things we use cuz in the geek nice pipeline is The thing is we don't do it cuz we haven't interviewed anyone and for fuck There are other ways we can interview people though without doing that.

146
00:08:41,232 --> 00:08:42,543
Speaker 0: Yeah but there are a pain in the ass.

147
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:50,852
Speaker 0: and Also, I have this integrated into the room like I can throw a channel into the mod like the speakers in the room or the Headphones.

148
00:08:50,952 --> 00:08:55,750
Speaker 0: I use this mixer as my sound card and it's it's kind of great actually to have those capabilities.

149
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,470
Speaker 0: Like I can record audio from the computer.

150
00:08:58,811 --> 00:09:05,948
Speaker 0: I could actually pipe our voices into audition and have a real-time pipeline to have the effects come back into the mixer for the live stream.

151
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:09,880
Speaker 0: But I'm actually using the old compressor for that because that's just easier.

152
00:09:10,562 --> 00:09:17,478
Speaker 0: But again, like this mixer has inserts and all that stuff so the a big part of why These mixers all suck.

153
00:09:17,618 --> 00:09:20,190
Speaker 0: Is that all the companies that make USB mixers?

154
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:25,115
Speaker 0: Still just use USB to Mmm, like webcams to like.

155
00:09:25,135 --> 00:09:27,903
Speaker 0: there really aren't USB 3 webcams or USB 3 mixers.

156
00:09:28,324 --> 00:09:29,327
Speaker 1: Why don't we just make one?

157
00:09:29,808 --> 00:09:33,136
Speaker 0: cuz I Don't know what the market is for these.

158
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:33,919
Speaker 0: Mmm.

159
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,765
Speaker 1: I actually asked her you'll find out.

160
00:09:35,805 --> 00:09:37,130
Speaker 0: so I actually asked her out.

161
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,478
Speaker 0: I dug around and make a Kickstarter.

162
00:09:38,518 --> 00:09:40,369
Speaker 1: if there's a market it'll you'll get kick-started.

163
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:45,326
Speaker 1: if Think oh, we'll make a Kickstarter, but then we'll be one of those people who don't deliver.

164
00:09:45,346 --> 00:09:46,010
Speaker 1: cuz what do we know?

165
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:53,470
Speaker 1: We'll just set the goal so ridiculously high that if we get that amount of money We're guaranteed to succeed exactly if we get like five million dollars.

166
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:53,753
Speaker 1: It's like.

167
00:09:53,773 --> 00:09:54,602
Speaker 1: I think we can do it.

168
00:09:54,703 --> 00:09:57,868
Speaker 1: we get you know We can deliver to the people and if we don't then we don't do it.

169
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:03,845
Speaker 0: But let's get my friends who work in like professional podcasts.

170
00:10:04,126 --> 00:10:09,710
Speaker 0: I ask people who are like in studios I even ask people at my job because where I work we have professional recording studios.

171
00:10:09,971 --> 00:10:12,183
Speaker 0: I went to the recording studio and fucking looked at what they got.

172
00:10:12,203 --> 00:10:13,650
Speaker 0: It's the same shit.

173
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,172
Speaker 0: I got.

174
00:10:14,494 --> 00:10:19,915
Speaker 0: everyone's just running the legacy hardware because it's still the best hardware But it's no.

175
00:10:20,216 --> 00:10:22,425
Speaker 1: all these companies that produce this equipment have to be.

176
00:10:22,525 --> 00:10:22,987
Speaker 1: are they like?

177
00:10:23,007 --> 00:10:26,670
Speaker 1: is People buying the new equipment because otherwise they'd be out of business?

178
00:10:26,931 --> 00:10:28,637
Speaker 1: It seems like are they not selling?

179
00:10:28,818 --> 00:10:29,962
Speaker 1: or maybe they are selling?

180
00:10:30,002 --> 00:10:32,030
Speaker 1: and if those people who are buying what are they doing?

181
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,521
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it seems like are they all musicians?

182
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:36,230
Speaker 1: is they doing musicians only and they don't?

183
00:10:37,674 --> 00:10:38,637
Speaker 1: And talk people?

184
00:10:38,677 --> 00:10:46,514
Speaker 0: a lot of the people who are at the level of sophistication that geek night says for audio They primarily do live Mixing.

185
00:10:46,936 --> 00:10:50,130
Speaker 0: where you need analog you need all that crazy analog shit.

186
00:10:50,411 --> 00:10:58,758
Speaker 0: So the room like the house has good audio like that, but they're not really trying to record The level of quality that we're recording.

187
00:10:58,778 --> 00:11:00,143
Speaker 0: They're recording the final mix.

188
00:11:00,384 --> 00:11:02,210
Speaker 0: They're recording like some track inserts.

189
00:11:02,512 --> 00:11:05,449
Speaker 0: It's a very different production pipeline from talk radio.

190
00:11:06,171 --> 00:11:07,917
Speaker 0: Talk radio is still using this shit.

191
00:11:08,237 --> 00:11:10,324
Speaker 0: Talk radio is still literally using morances.

192
00:11:10,725 --> 00:11:14,937
Speaker 0: I went to a professional recording studio Yesterday and what did I see?

193
00:11:15,137 --> 00:11:17,083
Speaker 0: sitting on the desk through the window?

194
00:11:17,103 --> 00:11:20,511
Speaker 0: a fucking Marantz PMD 660?

195
00:11:20,511 --> 00:11:21,034
Speaker 0: The same thing.

196
00:11:21,074 --> 00:11:25,456
Speaker 0: I got sitting right here that hasn't been manufactured since like 2003.

197
00:11:25,456 --> 00:11:31,890
Speaker 0: So yeah I Just want this mixer to last and I'm gonna see if I can physically fix some of the ports that have died.

198
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,804
Speaker 1: You're gonna break it will try and fix it and that's gonna be the end.

199
00:11:35,045 --> 00:11:35,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll cry.

200
00:11:37,934 --> 00:11:43,393
Speaker 0: I did open it up though to take a look and I actually looked as you saw fire in there The magic smoke came out.

201
00:11:43,914 --> 00:11:46,461
Speaker 0: I could solder in there that complicated.

202
00:11:46,481 --> 00:11:46,922
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

203
00:11:47,363 --> 00:11:49,789
Speaker 0: It's a pretty well documented actually all this stuff.

204
00:11:51,532 --> 00:12:15,563
Speaker 0: So in other news you might have noticed I think I mentioned this on gig nights a while ago But there is a weird story that kept popping up in the real news Like I saw this on FARC and then like months later it started appearing in crackpot news but eventually it started appearing on like CNN and like Washington Post and like real news.

205
00:12:15,984 --> 00:12:19,042
Speaker 0: and it was this story about like Sonic attacks.

206
00:12:19,062 --> 00:12:19,890
Speaker 1: didn't we talk about this?

207
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,558
Speaker 1: In Cuba we did so.

208
00:12:22,778 --> 00:12:26,430
Speaker 1: I think the final thing I saw about that was that it wasn't actually intentional.

209
00:12:26,811 --> 00:12:32,586
Speaker 1: It was some sort of accident where they just had a bunch of different equipment all set up near each other.

210
00:12:32,867 --> 00:12:41,510
Speaker 1: that happened to combine in a bad way Unluckily and it's due to incompetence and not due to some genius, you know intentional thing.

211
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:44,810
Speaker 0: So I read that same story and that was a narrative.

212
00:12:44,971 --> 00:12:47,484
Speaker 1: I mean the thing is I don't have none of know.

213
00:12:47,504 --> 00:12:48,690
Speaker 1: all this was just articles.

214
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:48,891
Speaker 1: There's.

215
00:12:48,932 --> 00:12:51,690
Speaker 1: no I haven't seen any actual evidence for any of this.

216
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:58,115
Speaker 1: I haven't even seen somebody like set up like in a test lab like proof that this happen Right.

217
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:01,270
Speaker 0: So basically that was a plausible explanation.

218
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:01,873
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

219
00:13:02,678 --> 00:13:04,588
Speaker 0: It's happening in other US embassies.

220
00:13:04,648 --> 00:13:07,839
Speaker 0: now Mm-hmm It's happening in China and they did.

221
00:13:07,859 --> 00:13:14,109
Speaker 0: we just have the US just evacuated a bunch of diplomats For basically the exact same symptoms the exact same problem.

222
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:18,050
Speaker 1: My guess, you know something more realistic?

223
00:13:18,391 --> 00:13:20,799
Speaker 0: It appears that mass hysteria is ruled out.

224
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,790
Speaker 0: the doctors have found actual specific brain damage.

225
00:13:24,832 --> 00:13:25,093
Speaker 1: No, no.

226
00:13:25,133 --> 00:13:31,375
Speaker 1: No, I'm saying is that I don't think it's caused by a You know say audio.

227
00:13:31,415 --> 00:13:33,843
Speaker 1: I don't think just because audio is just vibrating air.

228
00:13:34,003 --> 00:13:35,990
Speaker 1: I don't think vibrating air can cause brain damage.

229
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,696
Speaker 1: Yes, it can.

230
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:37,342
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

231
00:13:37,443 --> 00:13:38,189
Speaker 0: Yes, it can.

232
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:43,989
Speaker 1: I think that it is more likely caused by maybe a virus or a parasite or something like that.

233
00:13:44,551 --> 00:13:52,713
Speaker 1: That virus or parasite fucks with your ear so you think you're hearing sounds you ain't hearing or so It's not just that people are hearing sounds There's a you'd like.

234
00:13:52,754 --> 00:14:06,457
Speaker 0: this article actually goes into a little more explanation and a little more detail about it but the ultrasonic attack thing is still not actually ruled out and still seems to be feasible because the deal is Sound waves.

235
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:08,670
Speaker 1: I think it's something else that causes an audio hallucination.

236
00:14:09,812 --> 00:14:11,381
Speaker 0: It's not just audio hallucination.

237
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:13,010
Speaker 0: It's physical damage to the brain.

238
00:14:13,331 --> 00:14:17,523
Speaker 1: Yeah, the parasite or virus causes damage to your brain and gives you an auditory hallucination.

239
00:14:17,884 --> 00:14:19,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, but this is my reasonable guess.

240
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:25,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the crazy thing is that this is now happening in multiple places.

241
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:25,651
Speaker 1: Yeah You know what?

242
00:14:25,671 --> 00:14:32,540
Speaker 1: This tells me let's not travel to any countries that really hate the u.s So much in case we have to end up going to the end.

243
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,665
Speaker 0: I saw a great tweet.

244
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:53,019
Speaker 0: That was like 99% of everyone outside of North America who has a Canadian flag displayed is an American And I can feel that I mean we Emily and I were in Australia right before the election and It was rough even then and now it's getting rougher.

245
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:53,862
Speaker 0: Let's try.

246
00:14:53,902 --> 00:14:54,825
Speaker 1: they got their own problems.

247
00:14:54,965 --> 00:14:55,146
Speaker 1: Yeah.

248
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,570
Speaker 0: Oh, there's a crazy story.

249
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:04,517
Speaker 0: I didn't make my news because I don't fucking understand it or believe it about this town that has 12 people in it in Like the like the fucking nowhere in Australia.

250
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:04,898
Speaker 1: Okay.

251
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:05,599
Speaker 1: Was it just the word?

252
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,602
Speaker 1: Oh, I written 12 times.

253
00:15:06,722 --> 00:15:09,329
Speaker 0: So somebody disappeared from the town.

254
00:15:10,032 --> 00:15:15,190
Speaker 0: The government's pretty sure the town fucking murdered this dude and all agreed to keep it quiet and they can't prove it.

255
00:15:15,551 --> 00:15:18,163
Speaker 1: I mean, that's the only reasonable explanation.

256
00:15:18,223 --> 00:15:19,650
Speaker 1: So therefore there's no reasonable day.

257
00:15:20,031 --> 00:15:21,836
Speaker 1: There's no other reason.

258
00:15:22,116 --> 00:15:23,099
Speaker 0: there's also a hint.

259
00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:27,290
Speaker 1: if there is no other reasonable explanation then it's beyond reasonable doubt.

260
00:15:27,431 --> 00:15:30,610
Speaker 1: There's all the evidence you need and there's no other reasonable explanation.

261
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:35,325
Speaker 0: That is not the standard of American jurisprudence or law at least.

262
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,388
Speaker 1: Oh It's Australia.

263
00:15:38,331 --> 00:15:39,779
Speaker 1: The law is just like.

264
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:43,768
Speaker 0: ah, but this story was so crazy I didn't have time to read it enough to even talk about it.

265
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:50,390
Speaker 0: But I think the real thing we need to do is avoid US consulates and embassies in countries that hate us.

266
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,192
Speaker 1: It sounds good.

267
00:15:51,212 --> 00:15:53,319
Speaker 1: I'll just go to some other countries ever see instead.

268
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, but this story just it's You know, okay, you'll see like a crazy story.

269
00:15:59,311 --> 00:16:04,970
Speaker 0: And if you're a reasonable person you think that is probably not true and I will ignore it unless I keep seeing it.

270
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:09,387
Speaker 0: This one keeps happening and I'm getting increasingly fascinated by it.

271
00:16:09,608 --> 00:16:09,728
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

272
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:17,709
Speaker 1: so maybe they're hoping that some of that maybe it is like a virus or parasite and they're hoping that the Diplomat or someone will eventually meet the president and pass it on.

273
00:16:17,991 --> 00:16:18,452
Speaker 0: I mean like.

274
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:24,933
Speaker 0: this is in the realm of something like something like that about the Ukrainian guy who faked his own death to catch The Russian assassin.

275
00:16:25,114 --> 00:16:25,957
Speaker 1: that guy's badass.

276
00:16:26,558 --> 00:16:27,842
Speaker 1: They're gonna make a movie about that.

277
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:38,835
Speaker 1: Probably at least it'll be at least made for TV movie If not Hollywood movie and it will definitely be out within like a year because that story already is Literally twice as crazy as you realize.

278
00:16:39,136 --> 00:16:40,900
Speaker 0: like the story escalated.

279
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,863
Speaker 1: It is 100% true.

280
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:45,534
Speaker 0: It escalated way beyond what we already know Mm-hmm.

281
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,969
Speaker 0: But again, I didn't read it deep in depth enough to talk about it.

282
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,801
Speaker 0: I read enough in some other news.

283
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:56,747
Speaker 0: if you ever been in New York There's a. we have this huge bridge between New York and the rest of the country.

284
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:57,570
Speaker 0: It's called, New Jersey.

285
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:04,670
Speaker 0: I don't know if anyone's ever been to it But to get to that land bridge you have to go over another bridge called the Verrazano narrows bridge.

286
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:11,550
Speaker 1: You can use the George Washington bridge you can but and also technically the Verrazano bridge connects you to Staten Island and not to New Jersey.

287
00:17:11,651 --> 00:17:13,404
Speaker 1: but Staten Island is New Jersey.

288
00:17:13,626 --> 00:17:21,470
Speaker 0: well, so The Verrazano narrow bridge and Staten Island combined is a bridge to New Jersey, which itself is a land.

289
00:17:21,932 --> 00:17:32,534
Speaker 1: After you go over the Verrazano and then over this elevated highway that allows you to not touch Staten Island like it's hot lava you go over either the The what's it called?

290
00:17:32,554 --> 00:17:33,757
Speaker 1: There's the gothals bridge.

291
00:17:33,797 --> 00:17:37,186
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then there's the what the cross something.

292
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:38,269
Speaker 1: I don't cross island.

293
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,414
Speaker 1: I forget what it's called.

294
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:40,781
Speaker 0: I usually use the gothals.

295
00:17:40,841 --> 00:17:41,826
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's the other one.

296
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,076
Speaker 1: anyway I forget what it's called.

297
00:17:44,237 --> 00:17:47,370
Speaker 0: the Verrazano narrows bridge is real fucking long.

298
00:17:47,611 --> 00:17:50,990
Speaker 1: I biked over it because if you do normally you cannot bike over it.

299
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,015
Speaker 1: You can only car over.

300
00:17:52,075 --> 00:17:52,899
Speaker 1: it has two levels.

301
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,492
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if you do the five borough bike tour It's like.

302
00:17:55,533 --> 00:18:01,942
Speaker 1: the only part of it worth doing is that you can bike on roads that are otherwise Unbikable like the FDR and the BQE.

303
00:18:02,023 --> 00:18:02,364
Speaker 1: and it's when?

304
00:18:02,384 --> 00:18:03,630
Speaker 1: then the Verrazano.

305
00:18:04,075 --> 00:18:05,330
Speaker 1: So I did it once and that's enough.

306
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:09,710
Speaker 1: But you go over there Verrazano and let me tell you I bike over like the Queensborough bridge every day.

307
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,087
Speaker 1: It's like not even I don't even notice that it's a hill.

308
00:18:16,851 --> 00:18:20,410
Speaker 1: It's not that it's like you look at the grade and it doesn't seem like it's so bad.

309
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,494
Speaker 1: It's like fuck that bridge.

310
00:18:21,554 --> 00:18:22,718
Speaker 0: Yep, two miles later.

311
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:25,609
Speaker 1: It is long and it's a big hump.

312
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:27,073
Speaker 1: They keep.

313
00:18:27,234 --> 00:18:30,170
Speaker 1: people keep like campaigning like we want to put a bike path on it.

314
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,557
Speaker 1: I'm like, you're never gonna use that.

315
00:18:32,261 --> 00:18:36,444
Speaker 1: go up and you're just gonna turn right back around Especially when you realize Staten Island's.

316
00:18:36,484 --> 00:18:40,870
Speaker 1: on the other side There's a kind of person who will use that and you're not gonna be able to bike if you're trying.

317
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,640
Speaker 1: You know you once you get to the other side on.

318
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,776
Speaker 1: if there was a bike path now You can't go on the highway.

319
00:18:45,836 --> 00:18:49,090
Speaker 1: instead you're gonna go down and actually touch that lava.

320
00:18:49,373 --> 00:18:51,693
Speaker 0: Yeah, you do not want to touch Staten Island You're gonna.

321
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:58,197
Speaker 1: you're gonna bike as fast as you can back to the ferry cuz you can go back over the bridge Rise back to civilization.

322
00:18:58,317 --> 00:19:04,369
Speaker 0: the Verrazano narrows bridge is named after Giovanni de Verrazano some Italian guy.

323
00:19:04,671 --> 00:19:10,030
Speaker 0: So there's a bunch of crazy shit going on with this bridge and Giovanni de Verrazano.

324
00:19:10,451 --> 00:19:28,050
Speaker 0: so in the 50s the Italian American community was really I guess concerned about Its image in America and it made a Concerted funded effort to get things named after Italians all around the country funded with the money from the family.

325
00:19:28,371 --> 00:19:37,437
Speaker 0: And one of those things was they wanted this bridge which was just going to be called the narrows bridge to be named after Giovanni de Verrazano, why is it called the narrows?

326
00:19:37,497 --> 00:19:39,462
Speaker 1: It crosses the least narrow part.

327
00:19:39,563 --> 00:19:40,345
Speaker 0: That's actually them.

328
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:42,169
Speaker 0: It's the narrowest part.

329
00:19:44,152 --> 00:19:45,740
Speaker 0: If you wanted to put a bridge down there.

330
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,890
Speaker 0: anywhere else is way less narrow.

331
00:19:48,614 --> 00:19:51,089
Speaker 0: I guess so and they needed a bridge there.

332
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:53,275
Speaker 1: So who do need a bridge?

333
00:19:53,636 --> 00:19:55,400
Speaker 0: New York and Robert Moses is like.

334
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:59,250
Speaker 0: the response to this was who the fuck is Giovanni de Verrazano?

335
00:19:59,674 --> 00:20:06,439
Speaker 0: because apparently Giovanni de Verrazano is Less objectionable than a lot of the explorers like.

336
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:16,930
Speaker 0: it doesn't seem like there's a lot of genocide in his history like certain other people But he was really unlucky and that he discovered for white people a bunch of important things.

337
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,578
Speaker 0: He's one of the more important explorers.

338
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:19,905
Speaker 1: I never heard about him in school.

339
00:20:19,945 --> 00:20:23,742
Speaker 1: Yeah, no one heard about him I heard about like fucking Pons de Leon and shit instead.

340
00:20:24,103 --> 00:20:25,730
Speaker 1: We all learned about Spanish explorers.

341
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:32,730
Speaker 0: He happened to discover all these things in the 1500s while Magellan and the Conquistadors were happening.

342
00:20:33,071 --> 00:20:40,257
Speaker 0: So everyone paid attention to all that nonsense and ignored the fact that he basically Discovered like New York Harbor for white people.

343
00:20:40,457 --> 00:20:42,162
Speaker 1: didn't Henry Hudson discover.

344
00:20:42,683 --> 00:20:44,828
Speaker 0: No, that was way later and you're one of those people.

345
00:20:45,089 --> 00:21:03,795
Speaker 0: Hey Verrazano's reputation quote I'm recording Wikipedia was particularly obscure in New York City where the 1609 voyage of Henley Henry Hudson was regarded as the de facto start of European exploration of New York, even though Giovanni de Verrazano mapped all that shit in like 1519.

346
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:04,660
Speaker 1: fuck you school.

347
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:06,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, tell me wrong.

348
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,017
Speaker 0: So nobody remembered this dude at all.

349
00:21:08,318 --> 00:21:10,708
Speaker 0: and New York City was like why the fuck would we name it after him?

350
00:21:10,748 --> 00:21:12,865
Speaker 0: and the Italian Community was like because here's a pile of money.

351
00:21:12,925 --> 00:21:15,874
Speaker 0: Shut up We spelled it wrong.

352
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:20,470
Speaker 0: They fucked up and spelled it with one Z and when they realized it it was too late to change it.

353
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:24,965
Speaker 1: So that's why it has two and it's supposed to have three supposed to have two Z's it only has one.

354
00:21:24,985 --> 00:21:26,812
Speaker 1: I Thought I had two Z's.

355
00:21:26,893 --> 00:21:29,081
Speaker 0: Yeah, apparently a lot of people think it only has it.

356
00:21:29,362 --> 00:21:32,082
Speaker 1: apparently this is why this is the pretty sure It has two Z's.

357
00:21:32,953 --> 00:21:35,629
Speaker 1: This is why I've never seen a sign with only one Z on it.

358
00:21:36,112 --> 00:21:39,372
Speaker 0: So this is the news June 7th 2018.

359
00:21:39,372 --> 00:21:44,230
Speaker 0: There is a bill in the New York State Senate Assembly that just passed unanimously.

360
00:21:44,391 --> 00:21:48,827
Speaker 0: Wait, the Senate Assembly the New York State Senate passed the bill.

361
00:21:48,927 --> 00:21:50,613
Speaker 0: Okay Unanimously.

362
00:21:50,633 --> 00:21:55,167
Speaker 0: that would correct the spelling of the name and even Simba Felder voted.

363
00:21:55,207 --> 00:21:55,488
Speaker 1: Yes.

364
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:57,270
Speaker 0: Yeah unanimous.

365
00:21:58,752 --> 00:22:01,042
Speaker 0: To add a Z to the name of the Paris.

366
00:22:01,203 --> 00:22:02,650
Speaker 1: I thought it had two Z's already.

367
00:22:03,411 --> 00:22:10,053
Speaker 0: Yeah, not only did it not but it's been spelled wrong forever and For almost a hundred years.

368
00:22:10,093 --> 00:22:17,087
Speaker 0: the statue at the base of the fucking bridge has its that was made at the same time as the Bridge was spelled correctly.

369
00:22:18,131 --> 00:22:20,199
Speaker 0: Two Z's it's spelled correctly.

370
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:22,810
Speaker 1: I feel like all the green highway signs have two Z's on them.

371
00:22:23,392 --> 00:22:25,138
Speaker 1: Am I remembering wrong?

372
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:26,102
Speaker 1: because I know how to spell.

373
00:22:26,202 --> 00:22:31,403
Speaker 1: I think my brain if I brain just Transforms a misspelled word into a correctly spelled world.

374
00:22:31,443 --> 00:22:36,690
Speaker 1: when I look at it, I think Now the Mandela I can't even go over and look cuz I have a car.

375
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:42,770
Speaker 0: Yeah So the bill was now sent to the assembly where it must pass and then Cuomo will have to sign it.

376
00:22:42,951 --> 00:22:44,850
Speaker 1: Apparently the assembly will vote.

377
00:22:46,252 --> 00:22:50,150
Speaker 0: Apparently they tried to do this earlier this year and the assembly didn't fucking vote.

378
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:55,030
Speaker 1: Yes, the assembly is usually like the one who votes yes all the time and everything it's held up in the Senate.

379
00:22:55,172 --> 00:23:02,636
Speaker 1: I cannot for the life assembly actually has voted for things like universal health care for all New Yorkers and the Senate won't vote on so I Cannot.

380
00:23:02,676 --> 00:23:04,670
Speaker 1: why is this the opposite situation?

381
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:08,966
Speaker 0: I do not know and no one will tell me and my research came up with.

382
00:23:08,986 --> 00:23:09,950
Speaker 1: this makes no sense.

383
00:23:10,236 --> 00:23:18,530
Speaker 0: Yeah This is the first time in New York State history where the New York State Senate did something right and the assembly is doing something.

384
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,050
Speaker 1: Why do we need a law to fix spelling?

385
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,058
Speaker 1: Like the DOT or the Port Authority?

386
00:23:23,078 --> 00:23:23,520
Speaker 1: just fix it.

387
00:23:24,183 --> 00:23:24,645
Speaker 1: They don't need it.

388
00:23:24,665 --> 00:23:25,590
Speaker 1: Why do they need a law for that?

389
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,236
Speaker 0: This is my more meta argument.

390
00:23:27,437 --> 00:23:30,610
Speaker 0: Why the fuck does New York State have any fucking say in anything we do down here?

391
00:23:31,632 --> 00:23:32,967
Speaker 0: That is not I'm actually mad about.

392
00:23:33,008 --> 00:23:36,384
Speaker 1: I mean Why is you even need a law to make the name of a bridge?

393
00:23:36,444 --> 00:23:40,239
Speaker 1: can't just like, you know The Port Authority or MTA whoever runs the British.

394
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,407
Speaker 1: It's a Port Authority bridge the outer bridge crossing.

395
00:23:42,427 --> 00:23:43,170
Speaker 0: That's the other one.

396
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:43,879
Speaker 1: That's the other one.

397
00:23:43,981 --> 00:23:53,117
Speaker 0: Thanks to Amanda But anyway things of the day.

398
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:54,942
Speaker 0: so I found this video.

399
00:23:54,982 --> 00:24:02,907
Speaker 0: it's like 10 minutes long where this dude is like I'm a make a bike where the entire frame is made out of spring.

400
00:24:02,947 --> 00:24:03,690
Speaker 1: that will not work.

401
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:07,290
Speaker 1: The bike will just go blorp and fall over and this video is an exploration.

402
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:08,154
Speaker 1: You will have it.

403
00:24:08,174 --> 00:24:11,670
Speaker 1: you will have a sculpture made that looks like a bike that is made of spring.

404
00:24:12,111 --> 00:24:14,598
Speaker 1: That will be impossible to ride and it will not stand up.

405
00:24:14,658 --> 00:24:26,799
Speaker 0: this video basically tracks a long journey of this person Trying to make a bike where the frame consists entirely of Springs and Failing in most of the endeavor.

406
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,050
Speaker 0: Yes, and it's pretty funny and pretty interesting.

407
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:41,182
Speaker 0: there's points where he's took like talking to people who manufacture Springs and like that Simpsons episode where Moleman is like I need the biggest seed bell you've got.

408
00:24:41,824 --> 00:24:43,690
Speaker 0: no, that's too big.

409
00:24:44,751 --> 00:24:52,981
Speaker 0: He's not talking to people who make industrial Springs where he's like I need the stiffest spring you got and they're like Yeah, so we have a forty thousand dollar spring.

410
00:24:53,001 --> 00:25:05,130
Speaker 0: That's a foot wide and he's like, okay, let's back it off And eventually he is able to replace the entire core of the frame of the bicycle with Springs.

411
00:25:05,511 --> 00:25:18,088
Speaker 0: Yeah, not the whole frame just part that basically like the the top bar and the three bars Made one where the struts for the front tire were made of Springs and it did not.

412
00:25:18,168 --> 00:25:18,990
Speaker 0: it was unbikable.

413
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,657
Speaker 1: Yes, I think what someone should do though.

414
00:25:20,677 --> 00:25:21,801
Speaker 1: This is a stupid idea.

415
00:25:21,841 --> 00:25:25,474
Speaker 1: I think right it's all it's cute But I think would be not.

416
00:25:25,795 --> 00:25:40,350
Speaker 1: that would be much cooler would be to make a bike entirely of shocks because then the springs Would do what they supposed to do and only spring in the one, you know axis and not wobble a bike sideways Right, I'll ride this thing when he finishes it.

417
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:40,873
Speaker 0: It's just like.

418
00:25:41,115 --> 00:25:56,440
Speaker 1: so you would have a. you right, you know You have a bike that is flexible forward and back and up and down in certain dimensions But you wouldn't have like the front part of the bike on warp to the left or the right making it unrideable And I think that that would actually be.

419
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:03,650
Speaker 1: it probably still wouldn't work too Well, but it could actually be way comfortable like the bike would get longer or shorter as necessary, right?

420
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,561
Speaker 1: You could depending on how the stiffness of the springs.

421
00:26:05,601 --> 00:26:17,061
Speaker 1: I would you probably just use yeah I'll use adjustable like pneumatic shocks that way you could like, you know ease up certain ones Stiffen other ones so that you can get the bike like just right.

422
00:26:17,602 --> 00:26:19,850
Speaker 1: it would probably the smoothest fucking ride.

423
00:26:20,394 --> 00:26:22,570
Speaker 1: You probably wouldn't even feel the ground at that point.

424
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:26,030
Speaker 0: I want a computer-controlled active ground cancellation bike.

425
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:32,412
Speaker 1: The only reason I think that won't work is because you won't have enough fuel to carry a battery big enough to power the computer And such.

426
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:39,322
Speaker 1: yeah, because you all the sensors you would need and plus, you know Plug it in really long extension cord.

427
00:26:39,523 --> 00:26:40,749
Speaker 1: It would be a tank like bike.

428
00:26:41,735 --> 00:26:50,130
Speaker 0: But this video is pretty funny because in the end He does make a functioning bike that has three spring leaves fun for some definitions of funk.

429
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:52,846
Speaker 0: He's able to ride it like look it's going sure.

430
00:26:52,886 --> 00:27:00,128
Speaker 0: He's pedaling It's going barely and he explores fully what this bike is capable of and it's not much.

431
00:27:00,308 --> 00:27:07,870
Speaker 1: Nope I Think that just making a gif of that one, but up but up but up part I think illustrates the whole thing.

432
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:08,674
Speaker 1: That's all you need to see.

433
00:27:08,855 --> 00:27:09,679
Speaker 1: So you got a thing of the day.

434
00:27:09,699 --> 00:27:11,830
Speaker 1: I got two things of the day.

435
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:12,192
Speaker 1: Why not?

436
00:27:12,292 --> 00:27:15,048
Speaker 1: one of them is just a gif I saw on Twitter of this dog.

437
00:27:15,088 --> 00:27:15,450
Speaker 1: He float.

438
00:27:15,671 --> 00:27:17,298
Speaker 1: Oh, he float and I want to.

439
00:27:17,358 --> 00:27:24,229
Speaker 1: when I saw this gif it had such a profound impact on me I wanted to immediately leave work and float and I'm still considering just leaving here and floating.

440
00:27:25,172 --> 00:27:25,835
Speaker 1: I can just go.

441
00:27:25,996 --> 00:27:26,660
Speaker 1: they won't stop me.

442
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:31,210
Speaker 1: if I just go to the airport and give them my credit card They will take me to a place where the water is warm.

443
00:27:31,592 --> 00:27:38,748
Speaker 1: They will not object no one will stop me and then when I get there I can give my credit card to someone else and they will give me a place to sleep and float.

444
00:27:38,989 --> 00:27:41,030
Speaker 0: Yep I think that will happen.

445
00:27:41,271 --> 00:27:47,670
Speaker 0: You can keep floating till one day that person comes back and says sir Your credit card was declined and then I will go back to the airport.

446
00:27:50,771 --> 00:27:51,413
Speaker 1: It could happen.

447
00:27:51,494 --> 00:27:52,016
Speaker 1: I could do it.

448
00:27:52,116 --> 00:27:52,859
Speaker 1: I'm thinking about it.

449
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,030
Speaker 0: any water at Sandy Hook is 68 degrees too cold.

450
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:59,984
Speaker 0: We are five degrees away from the bare minimum.

451
00:28:00,044 --> 00:28:01,770
Speaker 0: I'm willing to put my body in that water.

452
00:28:02,091 --> 00:28:03,276
Speaker 0: We are ten degrees away from.

453
00:28:03,376 --> 00:28:03,898
Speaker 0: I will swim.

454
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,364
Speaker 1: So I went to.

455
00:28:05,425 --> 00:28:06,670
Speaker 1: here's my real thing of the day.

456
00:28:07,092 --> 00:28:07,775
Speaker 1: It's not just a gif.

457
00:28:08,197 --> 00:28:14,748
Speaker 1: so, you know, I pretty much have you know, you know Sometimes you get you know in a consumer materialist mood you start buying stuff, right?

458
00:28:14,869 --> 00:28:17,920
Speaker 0: Yeah It's always that thing when I go to Amazon to buy like a serious thing.

459
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:22,985
Speaker 0: I started looking at other serious purchases I've been holding a while ago.

460
00:28:23,025 --> 00:28:28,026
Speaker 1: like a year or two ago I bought basically every kind of camera that I'd ever need in my life and I actually use them all.

461
00:28:28,066 --> 00:28:34,330
Speaker 1: none of them became bowling Balls, I did a good job of buying exact amount of camera stuff that I use it all to the correct degree.

462
00:28:34,491 --> 00:28:37,543
Speaker 1: I don't feel regret buying any of it and I didn't buy too much.

463
00:28:37,884 --> 00:28:42,310
Speaker 1: and as soon as I bought like enough I like lost all desire to buy more camera stuff.

464
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:47,090
Speaker 1: Like I have no desire to buy another lens or camera because I already have every single situation.

465
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:58,006
Speaker 1: I've got covered except for taking photos of space which I can't do like ignites once and if I had to I would just I would keep reading about microphone once we bought the countrymen and these beta mics.

466
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,256
Speaker 0: I've got every microphone I'll need forever.

467
00:29:00,417 --> 00:29:02,129
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll get one shotgun mic.

468
00:29:02,451 --> 00:29:10,801
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm good for life anyway, but I then discovered the other day someone posted one of those gifts where it's like You know animates a little bit like to the left and right.

469
00:29:10,841 --> 00:29:12,710
Speaker 1: it wiggles and it looks 3d, right?

470
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:15,145
Speaker 1: It's one of those wiggling gifts that looks 3d, but it's not.

471
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:18,058
Speaker 1: I like those Yeah, and usually there's different.

472
00:29:18,158 --> 00:29:18,961
Speaker 0: one can just make them.

473
00:29:19,282 --> 00:29:21,470
Speaker 1: I know a lot of people make them using different techniques.

474
00:29:22,933 --> 00:29:25,422
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I mean there's a lot of different techniques for making them.

475
00:29:25,803 --> 00:29:31,670
Speaker 1: but apparently this person, you know Did it with a thing called a Nim's low and I was like what the fuck is a Nim's low?

476
00:29:32,931 --> 00:29:34,783
Speaker 1: Nim's low is apparently this old camera.

477
00:29:34,803 --> 00:29:39,202
Speaker 1: There's another cheaper version That's like a conica something or whatever, but the Nim's low is the good one.

478
00:29:39,583 --> 00:29:44,950
Speaker 1: where it's a 35 millimeter film camera It just has four fucking lenses on it with four shutters.

479
00:29:45,311 --> 00:29:59,770
Speaker 1: Oh and it makes lenticular pen and you take a picture and when you take a picture It uses the amount of space on the film that would normally be used for two normal 35 millimeter shots And it basically cuts each frame in half and uses two frames.

480
00:30:00,111 --> 00:30:10,310
Speaker 1: So if you have a roll of film that has 36 shots you would get 18 shots Right with this and each shot gives you four slightly different angles on the same thing.

481
00:30:10,691 --> 00:30:12,177
Speaker 1: It's a completely automatic camera.

482
00:30:12,197 --> 00:30:14,806
Speaker 1: It requires basically no focus autofocus.

483
00:30:14,907 --> 00:30:15,770
Speaker 1: No, you don't got to do anything.

484
00:30:15,871 --> 00:30:19,190
Speaker 1: I just push the button and if it's too dark you put a flash on it.

485
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,498
Speaker 1: You don't got to adjust the f-stop.

486
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:21,766
Speaker 1: You don't go to just the shutter speed.

487
00:30:21,806 --> 00:30:22,490
Speaker 1: You're gonna nothing.

488
00:30:22,711 --> 00:30:23,695
Speaker 1: You just aim it and shoot.

489
00:30:24,057 --> 00:30:28,952
Speaker 1: it takes four shots slightly different angles of the same thing Simultaneously.

490
00:30:28,972 --> 00:30:30,317
Speaker 0: just lens lens lens lens.

491
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:36,018
Speaker 1: when you get home you scan your four shots in Photoshop You drag you put them on four layers.

492
00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:45,218
Speaker 1: You put them on top of each other and you tell Photoshop Hey make an animated gif go frame one, two, three, four, three two and then you're back to one again and then loop it.

493
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,370
Speaker 1: and then you've got one of those things and I kind of wanted this.

494
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:55,850
Speaker 1: and it's only like, you know for like a new one in box from the olden days that was never open is like 250 on eBay, you know.

495
00:30:55,991 --> 00:30:57,390
Speaker 0: So it looks like before.

496
00:30:57,571 --> 00:30:58,654
Speaker 1: He's probably too much.

497
00:30:58,694 --> 00:30:59,918
Speaker 0: before the era of gifting.

498
00:30:59,978 --> 00:31:03,870
Speaker 0: people would use this camera to make physical versions of that with the lenticular print.

499
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:06,330
Speaker 1: Well people would use this in the olden days.

500
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:10,650
Speaker 1: I think there was actually a way to make an actual 3d image somehow develop.

501
00:31:12,052 --> 00:31:15,785
Speaker 1: You would look at it with you know, the the piece of plastic on it with the ridges.

502
00:31:15,926 --> 00:31:17,170
Speaker 0: that's called lenticular printing.

503
00:31:17,331 --> 00:31:18,175
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

504
00:31:18,275 --> 00:31:18,939
Speaker 0: I kept I didn't.

505
00:31:19,381 --> 00:31:20,647
Speaker 0: I look here see that.

506
00:31:21,631 --> 00:31:24,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I don't know how to print one of those things with the ridges.

507
00:31:25,221 --> 00:31:28,130
Speaker 1: But yeah, I kind of want this.

508
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:34,236
Speaker 0: I haven't bought it yet But I kind of thing got pretty cheap toward the end of the 90s Like I recall there was a.

509
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:38,260
Speaker 1: yeah now I haven't seen it hardly at all recently It's coming back feel like cuz.

510
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,650
Speaker 1: everyone looks at things on a screen.

511
00:31:40,571 --> 00:31:43,163
Speaker 1: There's no interest in having a still image on a piece of.

512
00:31:43,364 --> 00:31:51,010
Speaker 0: so from what I gather Relatively recently like in the last few years there was a further advance where it's way fucking cheap to print this.

513
00:31:51,353 --> 00:31:57,910
Speaker 0: so people are starting to make like Small low-key cheapo merch like keychains and things that has lenticular printing again.

514
00:31:58,251 --> 00:32:03,092
Speaker 0: Cuz now it's in the realm of like geek nights could make a thing pretty cheaply and just do it All right.

515
00:32:03,112 --> 00:32:04,988
Speaker 1: Well go buy me a nims little so I can.

516
00:32:06,231 --> 00:32:09,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll buy you a nims low after I buy a new camera for geek nights.

517
00:32:11,051 --> 00:32:12,530
Speaker 0: Now I'm gonna camcorder.

518
00:32:13,258 --> 00:32:14,254
Speaker 0: Okay I don't want.

519
00:32:14,314 --> 00:32:15,681
Speaker 0: I want an actual camcorder.

520
00:32:15,721 --> 00:32:24,034
Speaker 0: the features of a camcorder Compared to the features of a micro four-thirds just like real camera I can do video.

521
00:32:24,174 --> 00:32:28,288
Speaker 1: the only real feature that the camcorder offers is the larger shape of it.

522
00:32:28,368 --> 00:32:32,105
Speaker 0: the physical Object is the integrated XLR and all that's just built in.

523
00:32:32,145 --> 00:32:34,539
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah, you can get one of those Thingy attached on top.

524
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,778
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is just built into the camera body Like a built-in ND filter.

525
00:32:38,818 --> 00:32:40,063
Speaker 1: Otherwise, they're really.

526
00:32:40,184 --> 00:32:41,450
Speaker 1: it's like built-in video lens.

527
00:32:41,911 --> 00:32:44,220
Speaker 0: I don't need to get like a expensive lens to go with.

528
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,853
Speaker 1: most of the good camcorders have lens mounts on the front these days Not built-in lenses.

529
00:32:48,074 --> 00:32:50,201
Speaker 0: Mmm depends depends on which one I'm looking at.

530
00:32:50,241 --> 00:32:53,010
Speaker 0: these Sony usually Panasonic usually their worst.

531
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:55,993
Speaker 0: They're larger.

532
00:32:56,013 --> 00:32:59,183
Speaker 0: there's a new Panasonic one that just came out with a one-inch sensor.

533
00:32:59,223 --> 00:33:00,187
Speaker 0: that's pretty good.

534
00:33:00,387 --> 00:33:03,277
Speaker 0: one inch is way small Yeah, but for what I need it's fine.

535
00:33:03,478 --> 00:33:03,638
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

536
00:33:04,461 --> 00:33:05,806
Speaker 0: I don't need a full-frame camera.

537
00:33:05,826 --> 00:33:06,669
Speaker 0: We're not we're not.

538
00:33:06,729 --> 00:33:08,010
Speaker 1: no I don't have a full-frame camera.

539
00:33:11,137 --> 00:33:16,970
Speaker 0: In the better moment the geek notes book club book is Emily Wilson's translation of the Odyssey by Homer.

540
00:33:17,151 --> 00:33:22,456
Speaker 1: I read all the you know, the famous parts with the sirens and oh, yeah I gotta catch up.

541
00:33:22,496 --> 00:33:23,382
Speaker 0: then we got to finish it.

542
00:33:23,443 --> 00:33:25,637
Speaker 0: if you're reading at that rate I'll finish the book also.

543
00:33:25,677 --> 00:33:27,710
Speaker 1: that part is for being the most famous part.

544
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,218
Speaker 1: That is the most adapted.

545
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,490
Speaker 1: it's like one is like less than a page long.

546
00:33:31,691 --> 00:33:36,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like all that stuff happens in this one chapter and it's like people think that that's the whole Odyssey.

547
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:37,814
Speaker 1: That's like a few pages.

548
00:33:37,854 --> 00:33:39,821
Speaker 0: I think it's just American kids in high school.

549
00:33:39,861 --> 00:33:42,590
Speaker 0: They only read like three sections of the Odyssey.

550
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,477
Speaker 1: No, I think it's that you know.

551
00:33:44,537 --> 00:33:49,589
Speaker 1: popular culture adapted this one part of the Odyssey so heavily Yeah, and ignored all the other parts.

552
00:33:49,751 --> 00:33:55,216
Speaker 0: But most of the people we talked to like you guys fans who were talking or like reading the book with us None of them remembered any of this.

553
00:33:55,236 --> 00:33:56,821
Speaker 0: telemic is stuff like.

554
00:33:56,841 --> 00:33:57,764
Speaker 0: I don't remembered the.

555
00:33:58,045 --> 00:34:02,936
Speaker 0: everyone thinks the book starts Odyssey.

556
00:34:03,017 --> 00:34:09,126
Speaker 1: or if you read the pop-up book You should read this real new adaptation of the book so you can actually understand what the whole deal is.

557
00:34:09,186 --> 00:34:13,069
Speaker 0: cuz I bet you don't Yep, and we're gonna do a whole show on it and we're gonna assume you also.

558
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:18,190
Speaker 1: I hope she finishes that Iliad because all the others does is make me like want to read the Iliad.

559
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:22,739
Speaker 1: That's where all the Agamemnon Anything she translates Achilles is.

560
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,429
Speaker 1: I'm going to listen my boys this doesn't have my boys in it.

561
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:28,123
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna read every if she go if she does more Greek stuff.

562
00:34:28,164 --> 00:34:28,666
Speaker 0: I'll read it all.

563
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:29,228
Speaker 0: and what is she?

564
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:30,963
Speaker 1: what if she translates Antigone?

565
00:34:30,983 --> 00:34:34,725
Speaker 1: know the the story of rim Mel Pupo.

566
00:34:36,551 --> 00:34:41,329
Speaker 0: If there's a story about me written in ancient Greek, I feel like I need to read it.

567
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:42,841
Speaker 1: Yeah, it talks about awful.

568
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:46,138
Speaker 1: You are you're the worst If you read.

569
00:34:46,178 --> 00:34:46,842
Speaker 1: there was a rim.

570
00:34:46,882 --> 00:34:47,869
Speaker 1: he was the worst the end.

571
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:51,542
Speaker 0: Do you have you read like Antigone or like any of that stuff?

572
00:34:51,603 --> 00:34:55,973
Speaker 1: I think the one I actually want to read is this What was it?

573
00:34:56,172 --> 00:34:56,876
Speaker 1: I forget what.

574
00:34:56,896 --> 00:35:00,370
Speaker 1: it is some guy with an X in his name and it's a story about like Xenophon.

575
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:02,756
Speaker 1: It's one of those Xenophon stuff.

576
00:35:02,937 --> 00:35:04,561
Speaker 1: This is why I forget what it was.

577
00:35:04,581 --> 00:35:06,627
Speaker 0: I think you're thinking of Xenophon.

578
00:35:06,727 --> 00:35:07,609
Speaker 1: There's something like that.

579
00:35:08,714 --> 00:35:13,510
Speaker 1: It was a story about like a Traveling through Turkey or something on some sort of adventure.

580
00:35:14,631 --> 00:35:16,401
Speaker 1: Apparently a lot of stuff is based on this store.

581
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:18,010

599
00:36:24,051 --> 00:36:27,102
Speaker 0: So full disclosure, we do a lot of shows on food.

600
00:36:27,363 --> 00:36:27,744
Speaker 0: Like that's.

601
00:36:28,005 --> 00:36:29,390
Speaker 1: that's the thing we do on that side.

602
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:30,475
Speaker 1: That's you know on Thursday.

603
00:36:30,515 --> 00:36:31,460
Speaker 1: We run out of ideas.

604
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,470
Speaker 1: That's what happens to send us your Thursday ideas.

605
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:42,606
Speaker 1: Any show idea that requires no research And is not technology gaming or anime or comics or manga related?

606
00:36:42,626 --> 00:36:43,610
Speaker 0: You know what I could do again?

607
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:45,817
Speaker 0: I could let the patreon just vote on it.

608
00:36:46,178 --> 00:36:48,226
Speaker 0: But if they vote on something bad, it's their fault.

609
00:36:48,266 --> 00:36:52,329
Speaker 0: if we do a bad show I don't want to make a bad show though, but then we'll blame it on them.

610
00:36:53,172 --> 00:36:53,996
Speaker 0: They paid for that.

611
00:36:54,076 --> 00:36:56,204
Speaker 1: I'm actually not too worried about making a bad show.

612
00:36:56,244 --> 00:36:57,770
Speaker 1: I'm worried about sitting here and saying nothing.

613
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,077
Speaker 1: Yeah, because then there's no show.

614
00:37:00,178 --> 00:37:04,457
Speaker 0: but I feel like our thing is that it doesn't matter what the topic is We can somehow end up talking forever.

615
00:37:04,678 --> 00:37:05,822
Speaker 1: I mean we can hopefully.

616
00:37:05,842 --> 00:37:14,917
Speaker 0: I mean we could find a tangent and talk about The first four years of geek nights was just well, we're gonna talk about tangent 40 minutes of tangent.

617
00:37:14,957 --> 00:37:17,996
Speaker 1: but then I feel like I didn't do the show on the thing I was said I was gonna do.

618
00:37:18,016 --> 00:37:18,963
Speaker 1: the show doesn't matter.

619
00:37:18,983 --> 00:37:19,809
Speaker 0: We just got to make a show.

620
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,580
Speaker 1: We just change the show title later on.

621
00:37:21,701 --> 00:37:23,149
Speaker 1: Yeah, we record the intro.

622
00:37:24,532 --> 00:37:25,599
Speaker 0: It's just geek nights Thursday.

623
00:37:25,699 --> 00:37:30,437
Speaker 0: They're all just called geek nights Thursday The lounge sure.

624
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,870
Speaker 0: so full disclosure though, we are not Indian.

625
00:37:34,412 --> 00:37:36,098
Speaker 0: No, you're not Authority as an Indian food.

626
00:37:36,218 --> 00:37:39,330
Speaker 0: No, I don't actually know that much about Indian food.

627
00:37:39,571 --> 00:37:44,730
Speaker 0: No, I'm not even going to pretend that I know the regional differences of Indian food.

628
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:49,550
Speaker 0: No with the caveat that I do know a little bit about a hydra bad food.

629
00:37:49,932 --> 00:37:52,288
Speaker 0: Because guys you went there because I spent a lot.

630
00:37:53,072 --> 00:37:57,870
Speaker 0: I have probably spent a total of like five or six months in Hyderabad over the years.

631
00:37:58,354 --> 00:38:07,612
Speaker 0: Like I've spent a lot of time in Hyderabad I love Hyderabad food and the way I will describe food from Hyderabad is that you know when you get Indian food is really spicy Mm-hmm.

632
00:38:08,194 --> 00:38:12,270
Speaker 0: So if you go to Hyderabad and you get the non spicy food, it's that spicy.

633
00:38:12,852 --> 00:38:15,383
Speaker 0: If you get the spicy Hyderabad food, you're dead.

634
00:38:15,644 --> 00:38:15,965
Speaker 0: You're done.

635
00:38:16,005 --> 00:38:16,327
Speaker 0: That's it.

636
00:38:16,528 --> 00:38:17,090
Speaker 0: It's game over.

637
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:19,379
Speaker 1: But are there people in Hyderabad eating that spicy food?

638
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,890
Speaker 0: Oh, they're eating that food and they're complaining about how it's not that spicy.

639
00:38:23,531 --> 00:38:26,241
Speaker 0: They as the first time I was in Hyderabad.

640
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:27,386
Speaker 0: I was warned.

641
00:38:27,406 --> 00:38:28,410
Speaker 1: Why don't we send Judith there?

642
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,096
Speaker 0: I was worried the food was spicy.

643
00:38:30,256 --> 00:38:32,384
Speaker 0: cuz I was warned from my friends in Mumbai.

644
00:38:32,404 --> 00:38:35,650
Speaker 0: They're like, yeah, just be warned Hyderabad food is spicy.

645
00:38:35,852 --> 00:38:37,025
Speaker 1: I'm sure there are people that who live.

646
00:38:37,045 --> 00:38:44,202
Speaker 1: if people Tend to think that when someone comes from a country that has is known for its spicy food They think like Thai people.

647
00:38:44,242 --> 00:38:45,310
Speaker 1: they can all eat spicy food.

648
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:50,543
Speaker 1: There's plenty of Thai people who can't eat spicy food and there's plenty of Thai food That's not spicy and they don't.

649
00:38:50,563 --> 00:38:55,089
Speaker 1: they just eat that It's not like it's like even though a country has spicy food and is known for it.

650
00:38:55,411 --> 00:38:58,229
Speaker 1: Don't mistakenly think that all the people there love the spicy food.

651
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:02,570
Speaker 1: I'm sure there's people in Hyderabad who don't eat the spicy food and ask for mild food, right?

652
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,075
Speaker 1: There's nothing wrong with that.

653
00:39:04,296 --> 00:39:07,330
Speaker 0: There's a Thai place near us called tuk-tuk and one cool thing about it plays.

654
00:39:07,591 --> 00:39:08,376
Speaker 0: It is a real good place.

655
00:39:08,738 --> 00:39:10,870
Speaker 0: They have a special menu like on the back page.

656
00:39:11,311 --> 00:39:16,710
Speaker 0: They have a menu that is five or six Thai dishes that are not in any way Americanized.

657
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,976
Speaker 0: There's no substitutions.

658
00:39:19,318 --> 00:39:20,342
Speaker 0: they explain what they are.

659
00:39:20,423 --> 00:39:21,306
Speaker 0: they explain the history.

660
00:39:21,366 --> 00:39:25,742
Speaker 0: you can order them But they make it very clear if you are unable to eat it.

661
00:39:25,782 --> 00:39:26,725
Speaker 0: It's your fucking fault.

662
00:39:26,765 --> 00:39:27,408
Speaker 0: No refunds.

663
00:39:27,789 --> 00:39:27,909
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

664
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:31,588
Speaker 1: And I mean, isn't that the true with all restaurant food?

665
00:39:32,951 --> 00:39:37,990
Speaker 1: If I go to a place unless the food is like poison or has you know metal shards or glass?

666
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:39,355
Speaker 1: I don't expect the reef.

667
00:39:39,636 --> 00:39:42,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I find that most people are uncooked or something.

668
00:39:42,351 --> 00:39:45,910
Speaker 1: I think the reason is it's got to be really messed up for me to ask for my money back.

669
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:53,714
Speaker 0: I think in this case, the reason is white folk will order this food and it is too spicy for them And then they can't eat it.

670
00:39:54,015 --> 00:39:55,661
Speaker 1: Well, that's your home.

671
00:39:55,721 --> 00:39:55,982
Speaker 1: Yep.

672
00:39:56,022 --> 00:40:00,526
Speaker 0: So the menu is like listen kid This is actual Thai food.

673
00:40:00,626 --> 00:40:01,049
Speaker 1: That's right.

674
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,838
Speaker 0: But uh, so yeah, I got.

675
00:40:03,918 --> 00:40:07,610
Speaker 0: I got some like lamb beer out biryani cuz I was like I have some of that in my fridge.

00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, very on e tomorrow.

677
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:20,610
Speaker 0: Maybe yeah, Hyderabad is known Specifically which I did not know then for its fucking spicy biryani And I was defeated by this dish in the hotel.

678
00:40:20,791 --> 00:40:24,769
Speaker 1: I ever see when if I'm gonna travel to a country that doesn't speak it English, right?

679
00:40:25,671 --> 00:40:38,876
Speaker 1: Even if you know, even if the people there do speak English, even though it's that's not their primary language Yeah, I'm always gonna make sure that the phrase I gotta learn is always please serve me your local specialty in whatever language And I'll just go there.

680
00:40:38,976 --> 00:40:48,338
Speaker 1: and as long as it's not a thing that I don't eat which is a very short list like octopus and dolphin and whale and you anything to Monkey brain we got away.

681
00:40:48,398 --> 00:40:50,005
Speaker 1: as long as it's not one of those things.

00:40:50,366 --> 00:40:51,270
Speaker 1: It's just like bring it on.

683
00:40:51,350 --> 00:41:03,077
Speaker 1: I want to eat whatever your best thing is and however you eat it and if it kills me because it's too spicy alright, if Went out good if turkey calms down and is safe to travel to again And maybe the u.s.

684
00:41:03,137 --> 00:41:04,727
Speaker 1: Is hardly come down and safe to travel to.

685
00:41:04,828 --> 00:41:10,429
Speaker 0: yeah But turkey if it for that if that is what you want Istanbul is the place to go.

686
00:41:11,012 --> 00:41:14,890
Speaker 0: You want though you want like that any restaurant you go to as an American?

687

689
00:41:23,668 --> 00:41:24,250
Speaker 0: It's so good.

690
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:25,739
Speaker 0: I think I think.

691
00:41:25,779 --> 00:41:29,958
Speaker 0: of all the places I've traveled in my life Istanbul had the best food anyway India.

692
00:41:30,078 --> 00:41:31,443
Speaker 1: so back in the day.

693
00:41:31,463 --> 00:41:33,450
Speaker 1: I was not big fan Indian food.

694
00:41:33,812 --> 00:41:39,285
Speaker 1: I've always been a person Ellie not always but at least in my adult life I've always been a person who was willing to try any food.

695
00:41:39,306 --> 00:41:43,547
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, right It's like it was just very rare because I grew up in the Midwest.

696
00:41:43,587 --> 00:41:44,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's over.

697
00:41:44,371 --> 00:41:46,362
Speaker 1: It was right, you know my you know, my family was.

698
00:41:46,603 --> 00:41:55,649
Speaker 1: it's weird because when I was a kid I was you know, my brother was you know, super picky like french fries and you know, I remember that We'd all eat steak and he'd have his chicken.

699
00:41:55,972 --> 00:42:00,727
Speaker 1: I have like a piece of chicken nuggets and french fries kind of you know It seems to be a thing a lot of picky eaters do right?

700
00:42:00,747 --> 00:42:05,930
Speaker 1: Yeah But anyway, I was less picky, but I was more picky than like my parents.

701
00:42:06,231 --> 00:42:13,098
Speaker 1: But as when I became an adult and moved out and was able to eat a different food and not the food that was you Know given to me or available in a suburb.

702
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,529
Speaker 1: I was like, oh other food is good.

703
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:19,289
Speaker 1: And now my parents and my family are way pickier than I am.

704
00:42:19,811 --> 00:42:28,261
Speaker 1: But you know, even though I was willing to try any food once right at least, you know When I tried Indian food, I wasn't really that into it.

705
00:42:28,683 --> 00:42:30,650
Speaker 1: You know, it's like I remember I was like.

706
00:42:31,511 --> 00:42:36,767
Speaker 1: You know, I think we were living in Beacon and there was that Indian place next to the to the dragon's den.

707
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:45,630
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah And I went there, you know like a few times with those because you know That's where people were eating after playing games at the dragon's den, right?

708
00:42:45,991 --> 00:42:50,104
Speaker 1: So I would go there but you know the food there wasn't really that.

709
00:42:50,244 --> 00:42:55,350
Speaker 1: you know, it wasn't doing it for me so much Right, so I wasn't that into Indian food, but you know what?

710
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:58,690
Speaker 1: You know a lot of people out there when they don't like a food, right?

711
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:05,556
Speaker 1: They just refuse to eat it, but it's like I'm like, all right, listen, I don't like this, but you know It's not gonna poison me.

712
00:43:06,098 --> 00:43:24,006
Speaker 1: All right, and you know, the group would be, you know The whole crew to get together like Indian food and I'd be like, man, I don't want to go Right, but then I would go because I wasn't gonna be a baby right like some people are whoever if you're, you know I'm not gonna say any names, but you know who you are, you know who you are.

713
00:43:24,247 --> 00:43:25,933
Speaker 1: people who say no I'm not eating that.

714
00:43:25,993 --> 00:43:29,765
Speaker 1: I mean obviously allergies, you know vegetarians vegans.

715
00:43:29,785 --> 00:43:33,236
Speaker 1: That's all valid excuses Things like that, right?

716
00:43:33,296 --> 00:43:33,858
Speaker 1: I'm talking about.

717
00:43:33,899 --> 00:43:34,662
Speaker 0: I don't like like.

718
00:43:34,823 --> 00:43:35,647
Speaker 0: I don't like natto.

719
00:43:35,707 --> 00:43:37,315
Speaker 1: I'm just yeah I don't like not to either.

720
00:43:37,355 --> 00:43:40,290
Speaker 1: but you know what if everyone's like, hey, let's go to the natto place.

721
00:43:40,692 --> 00:43:43,463
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna be that, you know socially ruining person.

722
00:43:43,483 --> 00:43:44,086
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll go.

723
00:43:44,387 --> 00:43:48,682
Speaker 1: maybe I'll go Order a natto and begrudgingly eat it slowly like an adult.

724
00:43:48,702 --> 00:43:49,666
Speaker 0: That's one difference between us.

725
00:43:49,866 --> 00:43:50,850
Speaker 0: You'll begrudgingly eat.

726
00:43:51,131 --> 00:43:52,860
Speaker 0: I'm half perfectly willing to go hungry.

727
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:54,870
Speaker 1: Oh, you'll go hungry and not even eat the natto.

728
00:43:55,092 --> 00:43:57,412
Speaker 0: I will happily go hungry rather than eat food I don't like.

729
00:43:57,613 --> 00:44:07,479
Speaker 0: the other thing I'll do is I'll find something on the menu to eat if there is right like especially like You know a lot of times I don't understand the kind of person who can go to a restaurant And there's not one goddamn thing on that menu.

730
00:44:07,499 --> 00:44:07,801
Speaker 0: They'll eat.

731
00:44:07,921 --> 00:44:11,374
Speaker 1: even if I go to like a super seafood restaurant There's always like one steak on there.

732
00:44:11,394 --> 00:44:14,082
Speaker 0: Yeah, right cuz there's always the baby meal.

733
00:44:14,102 --> 00:44:16,488
Speaker 1: There's always a hamburger and I wouldn't do that.

734
00:44:16,549 --> 00:44:19,915
Speaker 1: But Anyway It's the thing.

735
00:44:19,955 --> 00:44:27,538
Speaker 1: the point is that I'm trying to make is that you know I was not a big fan of Indian food, even though he had tried quite a few different dishes There were some things I like.

736
00:44:27,578 --> 00:44:28,525
Speaker 1: like who doesn't like a naan?

737
00:44:28,706 --> 00:44:29,290
Speaker 1: right as a brand?

738
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:32,641
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know, I wasn't into it, but we can't tolerant people.

739
00:44:32,761 --> 00:44:33,503
Speaker 0: people kept.

740
00:44:33,544 --> 00:44:35,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm sure they like it.

741
00:44:35,571 --> 00:44:43,730
Speaker 1: They just came in We kept going to eat it over and over again and I kept trying different things there and discovering new things.

742
00:44:43,911 --> 00:44:53,390
Speaker 1: You know new things on the Indian, you know restaurant menus And trying different styles of Indian food and now I order any food on my own for delivery.

743
00:44:53,631 --> 00:45:03,769
Speaker 1: yeah, right and I think the thing is is a lot of people who don't like a thing and They don't even want to try it and it's like just keep begrudgingly eating it and develop a taste for it.

744
00:45:03,829 --> 00:45:17,706
Speaker 0: now Well, I've noticed I've known a lot of people There's a thing where people will try food that is from a particular Region or ethnicity or nation and if they don't like it They assume that that region's food is all one.

745
00:45:17,827 --> 00:45:20,216
Speaker 0: that exact thing They just tried to eat and to bet.

746
00:45:20,337 --> 00:45:22,726
Speaker 1: imagine if someone tried a hamburger like.

747
00:45:22,746 --> 00:45:23,690
Speaker 1: I don't like American food.

748
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:24,995
Speaker 1: So now they won't try fried chicken.

749
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:26,319
Speaker 1: Yep, which is American food.

750
00:45:26,379 --> 00:45:26,620
Speaker 1: Awesome.

751
00:45:26,761 --> 00:45:27,463
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

752
00:45:27,764 --> 00:45:29,089
Speaker 1: It's like that's not right.

753
00:45:30,093 --> 00:45:34,550
Speaker 1: Another thing I think that happens is the people get a bad first impression and pass a judgment.

754
00:45:34,791 --> 00:45:37,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, and unlike anime where you can totally do that just fine.

755
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:40,403
Speaker 1: They'll try say a bat.

756
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:44,886
Speaker 1: They'll try a fruit and that fruit that they try for the first time this new fruit.

757
00:45:44,926 --> 00:45:47,714
Speaker 1: Maybe it's like Not a durian.

758
00:45:47,994 --> 00:45:51,525
Speaker 1: They'll try like a mango for the first time and they'll try a mango.

759
00:45:51,686 --> 00:45:52,949
Speaker 1: That's not ripe and delicious.

760
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:58,205
Speaker 1: And then they'll judge all mangoes and now they won't drink a mango lassi.

761
00:45:58,366 --> 00:45:58,687
Speaker 0: So it's got.

762
00:45:58,727 --> 00:45:59,430
Speaker 1: I know you don't watch.

763
00:46:00,331 --> 00:46:01,716
Speaker 0: It's always sunny in Philadelphia.

764
00:46:01,736 --> 00:46:09,265
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, but there's a scene that is relevant to your interests Where basically there's one guy who's like never been outside of Philly in his entire life.

765
00:46:09,747 --> 00:46:10,733
Speaker 0: Okay, that's his deal like.

766
00:46:10,753 --> 00:46:16,647
Speaker 1: he's a character like When I was in Florida in the 90s like late 90s, or maybe he was even too early 2000s.

767
00:46:18,213 --> 00:46:29,984
Speaker 1: I needed a haircut because it was too hot and I still had hair And I just went to a rando haircut place and the lady who cut my hair who was in her 40s or something at the time I just went wherever she told me she had never.

768
00:46:30,065 --> 00:46:30,990
Speaker 1: she was like, oh, where are you from?

769
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:33,421
Speaker 1: Like oh, I'm from you know, I guess I was in.

770
00:46:33,441 --> 00:46:40,329
Speaker 1: I don't know if I was in New York or Connecticut, but whatever She's like I never left Florida Emma her whole life and she was like 40 or 50.

771
00:46:40,329 --> 00:46:51,281
Speaker 0: something I mean, I read saw a statistic a while ago that a good 20% of Americans have never lived outside of the county They were born it but I mean she'd never left period traveled.

772
00:46:51,402 --> 00:46:54,110
Speaker 1: No, not even in a car not even to, Georgia.

773
00:46:55,511 --> 00:46:57,116
Speaker 0: Well, at least New York City.

774
00:46:57,597 --> 00:47:01,850
Speaker 0: I'm more willing to accept why someone might live that way cuz I've been outside of New York.

775
00:47:01,911 --> 00:47:07,290
Speaker 0: So I'm just saying But so this scene so this dude who's never enough out of Philly.

776
00:47:07,531 --> 00:47:13,944
Speaker 0: They're having some like normal Steinfeld style conversation and it turns out he's never had a pair Doesn't even know what a pair is.

777
00:47:13,984 --> 00:47:14,449
Speaker 0: He's never.

778
00:47:15,991 --> 00:47:26,395
Speaker 0: So they're like you gotta get a pair and they like stop at a market and they're like buy a pair from like a dude And they hand it to him fights into it and he's like, ah, no, I don't like this I don't like this at all.

779
00:47:26,415 --> 00:47:27,682
Speaker 0: They're like what what he can it's a pair.

780
00:47:27,702 --> 00:47:28,325
Speaker 0: What do you not like about?

781
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:33,524
Speaker 0: he's like it's Sandy and bland and then they look it like oh, it's not a right pair.

782
00:47:33,564 --> 00:47:34,828
Speaker 0: and there's this whole thing about the.

783
00:47:34,848 --> 00:47:35,129
Speaker 0: it's true.

784
00:47:35,416 --> 00:47:35,730
Speaker 1: It's true.

785
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:41,694
Speaker 1: See pairs are one of those things where they're only good if you get the right variety of pair and it's perfectly Ripened the right amount.

786
00:47:41,754 --> 00:47:43,862
Speaker 1: Otherwise, it just tastes like a nothing fruit.

787
00:47:43,922 --> 00:47:46,070
Speaker 1: if it's ripe, then it's a sweet and sugary.

788
00:47:46,411 --> 00:47:48,820
Speaker 1: But the thing about pear is unlike other fruits.

789
00:47:49,181 --> 00:47:51,610
Speaker 1: It doesn't sort of have a flavor to go along with its sweetness.

790
00:47:51,751 --> 00:47:53,704
Speaker 1: It's literally like just sweet and that's it.

791
00:47:53,845 --> 00:47:57,205
Speaker 1: It tastes like pear Yeah, but pear doesn't have a strong flavor the way.

792
00:47:57,245 --> 00:47:58,010
Speaker 1: see certain apples.

793
00:47:58,271 --> 00:47:59,896
Speaker 1: Yeah, have a strong there's then there's.

794
00:47:59,916 --> 00:48:03,549
Speaker 0: you want to really taste certain other apples that just taste like sweet.

795
00:48:03,689 --> 00:48:08,809
Speaker 0: Yes It's true, but all pairs look at you read delicious You're the worst Apple exactly.

796
00:48:09,251 --> 00:48:15,070
Speaker 1: But the point is if you want to taste a really good pair the best way to taste really the best pair.

797
00:48:15,451 --> 00:48:16,495
Speaker 1: Just get canned pear.

798
00:48:16,816 --> 00:48:20,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, get canned pear bits in pear juice at the store and just eat it with a spoon.

799
00:48:21,413 --> 00:48:28,623
Speaker 0: That is probably the best pair that I was a kid I would just open up a can of canned pears and just eat it, right They're actually at the grocery store.

800
00:48:28,644 --> 00:48:30,674
Speaker 1: when I was a kid There was actually it would.

801
00:48:30,714 --> 00:48:35,330
Speaker 1: they sold canned pear as like yours as snack as like you a pack.

802
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:36,439
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I had those two.

803
00:48:36,459 --> 00:48:37,265
Speaker 1: I hate those.

804
00:48:37,386 --> 00:48:39,590
Speaker 1: like every day I'd eat I'd always been up a can of pear and eat it.

805
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:50,004
Speaker 0: So in high school, and then I drink the juice instead of bringing the small can pair with a little like Big like I brought a big one and a can opener I do that with pineapple.

806
00:48:50,044 --> 00:48:52,300
Speaker 1: these days I don't buy a whole pineapple.

807
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,450
Speaker 1: I'll buy a can of pineapple.

808
00:48:54,712 --> 00:48:55,657
Speaker 1: It comes in rings.

809
00:48:55,778 --> 00:48:56,965
Speaker 1: Anyway, Indian food.

810
00:48:57,025 --> 00:49:02,226
Speaker 1: So in food I the point I was trying to make earlier about developing a taste for something right is.

811
00:49:02,246 --> 00:49:09,019
Speaker 1: a lot of people make the argument Oh, you could develop a taste for alcohol And or develop a taste for smoking and all these harmful activities.

812
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:12,790
Speaker 1: and it's like no because harmful activities don't develop a taste for them.

813
00:49:13,152 --> 00:49:15,123
Speaker 1: But something like Indian food is not harmful.

814
00:49:15,183 --> 00:49:16,310
Speaker 1: It's good for you and delicious.

815
00:49:16,593 --> 00:49:24,489
Speaker 1: So even if you don't like it at first You should try to develop a taste for it because it will benefit you in life and also bring you joy without harming you.

816
00:49:24,509 --> 00:49:32,902
Speaker 1: so You know if there are things in life that are good and would be good if you like them Even if you don't like them originally, you should try to develop a taste for them.

817
00:49:32,942 --> 00:49:35,330
Speaker 1: Maybe you don't like sci-fi novels.

818
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:36,897
Speaker 1: Well, try to read it's.

819
00:49:36,937 --> 00:49:37,459
Speaker 1: they're good.

820
00:49:37,479 --> 00:49:38,424
Speaker 1: So try to read a few.

821
00:49:38,484 --> 00:49:39,890
Speaker 1: maybe you'll develop a taste for them.

822
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:42,822
Speaker 1: You should at least try a little bit, you know Indian food.

823
00:49:42,842 --> 00:49:44,068
Speaker 1: You should try drugs.

824
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:48,995
Speaker 1: No, don't Develop a taste for the meter if you could Depending on the drug.

825
00:49:49,035 --> 00:49:52,210
Speaker 0: I mean my dad is really excited about his medical marijuana card.

826
00:49:52,331 --> 00:49:55,069
Speaker 1: I'm talking like, you know, don't develop a taste for heroin guys.

827
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:58,828
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's that's even though you could get used to shooting yourself up.

828
00:49:58,868 --> 00:50:02,360
Speaker 1: do not But do get used to curry cuz it's delicious.

829
00:50:02,401 --> 00:50:04,510
Speaker 1: Even if you don't like it at first maybe try again.

830
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,979
Speaker 0: We've already been going for like an hour halfway.

831
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,167
Speaker 1: Yeah, we didn't have any Indian foods though.

832
00:50:09,187 --> 00:50:09,548
Speaker 0: Let's go.

833
00:50:09,588 --> 00:50:10,070
Speaker 0: Let's go through.

834
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:12,298
Speaker 0: Let's just do a best of an Indian food.

835
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:14,827
Speaker 0: All right, so we're only talking about our personal.

836
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:15,570
Speaker 0: we gotta start.

837
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:16,593
Speaker 1: We got to start with rim.

838
00:50:16,633 --> 00:50:16,854
Speaker 1: Mr.

839
00:50:16,894 --> 00:50:17,817
Speaker 1: Samosa Samosa.

840
00:50:18,178 --> 00:50:20,344
Speaker 0: I fucking love Samosa.

841
00:50:20,364 --> 00:50:21,227
Speaker 1: They are delicious.

842
00:50:21,367 --> 00:50:22,410
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

843
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:25,241
Speaker 1: First of all, it's fried.

844
00:50:25,261 --> 00:50:30,199
Speaker 1: It's got this fried shell which is delicious and Inside the fried shell is chickpeas.

845
00:50:30,439 --> 00:50:37,303
Speaker 1: Yeah inside the fried shell is potato, you know Like mashed potato potato and chickpeas are two of my favorite things on earth.

846
00:50:37,563 --> 00:50:38,567
Speaker 1: and in that potato.

847
00:50:38,627 --> 00:50:42,810
Speaker 1: It's not just potato It's potato that's been flavored up with all kinds of spices and shit.

848
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:45,438
Speaker 1: So it looks all yellow or green or yellow and green.

849
00:50:45,458 --> 00:50:52,200
Speaker 1: and then the potato is filled with like peas and chickpeas and other Delicious naughty bits that are in that potato.

850
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:55,110
Speaker 1: and then it's all been fried and it's nice and warm and toasty.

851
00:50:55,190 --> 00:51:03,859
Speaker 1: And then you dip it in either the red stuff, which is sweet and fruity kind of The green stuff.

852
00:51:03,919 --> 00:51:11,587
Speaker 1: and you know what when I get Samosa they when you get ordered delivery They give you two samosas dip in both Alternating and they give you a red and they give you a green.

853
00:51:11,627 --> 00:51:12,090
Speaker 1: and you know what?

854
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:19,849
Speaker 1: I randomly pick one or based on my mood and I eat the first samosa in that and then the next day I heat up The other one and eat it in the other cup.

855
00:51:20,152 --> 00:51:23,515
Speaker 1: So I think the last one I got I got red So I got a green one.

856
00:51:23,555 --> 00:51:25,224
Speaker 0: that's the difference Emily and I reorder.

857
00:51:25,385 --> 00:51:27,675
Speaker 0: when we order Indian food We get a samosa.

858
00:51:28,137 --> 00:51:28,719
Speaker 0: it comes with two.

859
00:51:28,759 --> 00:51:29,341
Speaker 0: we each eat one.

860
00:51:29,863 --> 00:51:30,967
Speaker 0: There's never one left over.

861
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:31,710
Speaker 1: I got it left over.

862
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:32,453
Speaker 1: I'm only one person.

863
00:51:33,136 --> 00:51:36,770
Speaker 0: So in terms of naan garlic naan is one of my favorite foods on earth.

864
00:51:36,971 --> 00:51:40,350
Speaker 1: I mean, I like all naans and I sort of just keep picking different flavors of naan.

865
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:41,536
Speaker 1: I'll even eat the plain naan.

866
00:51:41,737 --> 00:51:46,196
Speaker 1: you get more naan flavor because a lot of times the you know Onion naan or a garlic naan will cover up.

867
00:51:46,256 --> 00:51:49,306
Speaker 0: but you need the naan to scoop the food together to finish it.

868
00:51:49,868 --> 00:51:52,626
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm I do like the rosemary naan quite a bit.

869
00:51:53,632 --> 00:51:54,857
Speaker 1: That's what my least favorite naan.

870
00:51:54,878 --> 00:52:00,259
Speaker 1: maybe cheese naan is the naan that I think I like a lot But I don't go for it too often because it's too powerful.

871
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:00,821
Speaker 0: Yep.

872
00:52:01,002 --> 00:52:07,578
Speaker 0: It's a. it's too filling and strong same with Oh Is one of my favorite things.

873
00:52:07,598 --> 00:52:08,581
Speaker 1: the poor II feels.

874
00:52:08,621 --> 00:52:13,058
Speaker 1: when you order a poor you feel like you're wasting your money because you're paying Basically a lot of money for a lot of nothing.

875
00:52:13,118 --> 00:52:14,263
Speaker 0: It's basically a bread balloon.

876
00:52:14,684 --> 00:52:21,547
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like so thin You're but it's it feels like eating like just the crust of a bread like you're peeling the crust off of a bread.

877
00:52:21,608 --> 00:52:22,330
Speaker 1: It's so good.

878
00:52:23,753 --> 00:52:24,968
Speaker 1: We're only eating the crust.

879
00:52:26,371 --> 00:52:31,250
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's basically just a balloon of bread and you pop it and then you eat it and it's delicious.

880
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:34,881
Speaker 0: I'm a real in terms of like core Indian food like main dishes.

881
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:37,690
Speaker 0: I think the sogs are my favorite types.

882
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:41,299
Speaker 0: Green spinach II maybe with the cheese like that.

883
00:52:41,319 --> 00:52:42,463
Speaker 0: That's my go-to.

884
00:52:42,844 --> 00:52:43,185
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

885
00:52:43,466 --> 00:52:46,049
Speaker 0: Not the chicken tikka masala That's like the American defaulting.

886
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:51,810
Speaker 1: Well, I actually like a chicken tikka masala but some places don't spice it up enough and it's just bland as hell.

887
00:52:52,111 --> 00:52:53,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, you gotta have a place where it's.

888
00:52:53,561 --> 00:53:01,292
Speaker 1: you know, it doesn't need to be hot spicy But it needs to have lots of you know aroma going on and some places do it in some places make it Land.

889
00:53:01,332 --> 00:53:02,618
Speaker 1: super bland is not good.

890
00:53:02,758 --> 00:53:05,530
Speaker 0: I like the Rogan Josh too, but sometimes it's just like a Rogan Josh.

891
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:07,878
Speaker 0: Sometimes it gets a little too spicy for me.

892
00:53:08,139 --> 00:53:09,243
Speaker 1: No, that's not too spicy.

893
00:53:09,263 --> 00:53:14,229
Speaker 1: The thing that gets too spicy for me is What's it called chicken?

894
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:19,870
Speaker 1: The chicken why we know where it's all covered in the hot red stuff where it's like just super on fire.

895
00:53:20,871 --> 00:53:22,096
Speaker 0: Not that not the tandoori chicken.

896
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:25,310
Speaker 1: No, the tandoori chicken is the one where it's not in a curry, right?

897
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:26,214
Speaker 1: It's just on its own.

898
00:53:26,576 --> 00:53:28,748
Speaker 1: Yep, and it's you put that in a nice yogurt sauce.

899
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:33,040
Speaker 0: I love that Favorite actually my favorite thing to eat, but I can't anymore cuz I'm old on that.

900
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:40,980
Speaker 0: heartburn is like tandoori chicken and biryani together Mmm, but as an adult that is too powerful.

901
00:53:41,521 --> 00:53:42,404
Speaker 0: That is too much.

902
00:53:42,604 --> 00:53:43,968
Speaker 1: Just bringing up the menu here.

903
00:53:44,329 --> 00:53:46,178
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm just looking through the Wikipedia.

904
00:53:46,198 --> 00:53:47,627
Speaker 0: I'm just getting real hungry.

905
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,230
Speaker 0: Look at all this.

906
00:53:51,373 --> 00:53:55,310
Speaker 0: The meta point is that I actually don't know enough about Indian food.

907
00:53:56,391 --> 00:53:58,300
Speaker 1: Vindaloo that's the one that's too.

908
00:53:58,341 --> 00:53:59,386
Speaker 1: Vindaloo is delicious.

909
00:53:59,426 --> 00:54:00,170
Speaker 1: I love vindaloo.

910
00:54:00,591 --> 00:54:07,590
Speaker 1: I'll order it sometimes but that actually usually it doesn't go into so hot that I'm like needing to eat snow and ice or something.

911
00:54:07,976 --> 00:54:16,623
Speaker 1: but it's usually like crosses the border of my heat tolerance like by like one step and then my head ends up breaking out into sweat and My mouth hurts a little bit,

912
00:54:16,927 --> 00:54:21,430
Speaker 0: but I guess When I'm at a good Indian restaurant, I'm ordering from a place in New York.

913
00:54:21,954 --> 00:54:34,556
Speaker 0: There was a lot of options And I don't know that much about Indian food in that depending on what I order I might not actually be a hundred percent sure Exactly what I'm gonna get.

914
00:54:34,576 --> 00:54:35,278
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

915
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,186
Speaker 1: And I've never been super wrong.

916
00:54:38,674 --> 00:54:39,378
Speaker 0: I I'm always.

917
00:54:39,438 --> 00:54:51,583
Speaker 1: I know that I'm gonna get some kind of meat Probably in some kind of sauce or curry or something and I'm gonna put it on rice and based on some of the words I might have a vague idea like something something sog.

918
00:54:51,623 --> 00:54:52,828
Speaker 0: It's gonna be the green stuff.

919
00:54:53,129 --> 00:54:53,249
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

920
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:55,839
Speaker 0: But I'm always weirded out when we go to Indian place.

921
00:54:55,879 --> 00:54:56,181
Speaker 1: Korma.

922
00:54:56,221 --> 00:54:58,610
Speaker 1: It's gonna be like the yellow white stuff, right?

923
00:54:58,911 --> 00:54:59,741
Speaker 0: I really love doll.

924
00:54:59,883 --> 00:55:01,755
Speaker 0: Oh my god I was like my go-to really.

925
00:55:02,217 --> 00:55:05,168
Speaker 0: but a lot of people we know a lot of people I've encountered over the years.

926
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:14,597
Speaker 0: they Won't order anything from any restaurant let alone any place unless they know every detail of exactly What is it now if you like?

927
00:55:14,637 --> 00:55:24,116
Speaker 1: I said if you're allergic or have some sort of dietary Right, but if you don't have that kind of restriction Not just Indian food.

928
00:55:24,156 --> 00:55:25,262
Speaker 1: you just order whatever.

929
00:55:25,362 --> 00:55:26,388
Speaker 1: don't ask them to change it.

930
00:55:27,112 --> 00:55:29,042
Speaker 1: Everything on the menu is delicious delicious.

931
00:55:29,082 --> 00:55:29,685
Speaker 1: If no one liked it.

932
00:55:29,705 --> 00:55:30,530
Speaker 1: They won't put it on there.

933
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:32,764
Speaker 1: Just keep ordering stuff and keep trying.

934
00:55:32,784 --> 00:55:33,790
Speaker 0: This has been a problem though.

935
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:41,158
Speaker 0: Sometimes we've gone out with a lot of people to get some Indian food and I don't remember what I ordered And I don't care what I get.

936
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,972
Speaker 0: nope, so whatever plate ends up in front of me I just eat.

937
00:55:44,434 --> 00:55:44,554
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

938
00:55:45,057 --> 00:55:49,435
Speaker 0: And sometimes I've eaten someone else's dish and then they come out with the thing I ordered and I'm in trouble.

939
00:55:49,776 --> 00:55:49,997
Speaker 1: Oh, well.

940
00:55:50,699 --> 00:55:56,589
Speaker 1: Oh the last thing we can't neglect to mention which I already mentioned a little bit Is the mango lassi the the king of?

941
00:55:57,670 --> 00:55:59,779
Speaker 0: Promode is the rose loss.

942
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:00,944
Speaker 1: No, that's your promo.

943
00:56:01,045 --> 00:56:02,250
Speaker 1: I don't like the rose loss.

944
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:10,209
Speaker 0: You're really only supposed to get that for like weddings, but there's a few places I know in New York that'll serve that and I always get it if it's on the menu.

945
00:56:12,172 --> 00:56:14,018
Speaker 1: Do not I get the regular mango lassi.

946
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:14,921
Speaker 1: I don't eat no roses.

947
00:56:15,263 --> 00:56:16,587

Speaker 1: But the thing is a roti.

950
00:56:25,796 --> 00:56:27,465
